<Q>&mdash;The mo&s;t High ruleth in the Kingdom of Men&mdash;</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE pre&s;ent unu&s;ual and gloomy appearance of the place <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In allu&s;ion to the pulpit hung with mourning on this occa&s;ion.</NOTE> in which I now &s;tand, may &s;eem the natural pre&s;age of a di&s;cour&s;e re|plete with gloomy ideas, with lamentation and mourning. But yet methinks this is a &s;ea&s;on adapted to awaken various, and even contrary pa&s;&s;ions in our brea&s;ts; a &s;ea&s;on wherein we almo&s;t unavoida|bly mingle &s;ome of the tears of joy with tho&s;e of &s;orrow; and wherein wholly to indulge, or wholly to repre&s;s either of them, would hardly be innocent; at lea&s;t not very congruous. On one hand we ju&s;tly mourn the death of an excellent king, whom every good Briti&s;h &s;ubject was habituated to con&s;ider rather under the amiable and endearing character of a father, than the more awful one of a &s;overeign. And where is the heart &s;o hard, &s;o unfeeling, &s;o devoid of all &s;entiment, as to remain untouch'd, unaffected, at the death of &s;uch a king, the common father of his peo|ple? What bo&s;om does not heave? What eye is not ready to overflow, on &s;o melancholy an occa&s;ion?</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="008925_0005_10303393847CE918">BUT, on the other hand, have we not cau&s;e for gratitude, that heaven &s;pared him to us &s;o long? and for joy, that his royal grand&s;on and &s;ucce&s;&s;or is peaceably a&s;cended the throne? And this at &s;uch a mature age, and adorned with &s;o many royal quali|ties, as give us the rea&s;onable pro&s;pect of &s;itting under his &s;hadow with great delight; and, in a Word, of enjoying under his reign the continuance of all tho&s;e numerous ble&s;&s;ings, which we &s;o long enjoyed under the au&s;picious reign of his late maje&s;ty. The &s;ame object has often both a bright and a dark &s;ide; and, by being turned round, gives relief, or even plea&s;ure, to the pained eye of the &s;pectator. As our felicity is never pure and unallayed in this evil world; &s;o neither is our &s;orrow ever, or hardly ever, unmixed; but u&s;ually attended with &s;ome circum|&s;tances, which, being duly con&s;idered, may admini&s;ter comfort to us. This is our pre&s;ent ca&s;e: That &s;o|vereign hand which gave the wound to our hearts by the death of his late maje&s;ty, has almo&s;t healed it the &s;ame hour, and turned our mourning into joy; or if not into joy, has at lea&s;t mini&s;tred the be&s;t con|&s;olation that the nature of the ca&s;e would admit of. For the lo&s;s of a good king cannot be any way &s;o effectually made up, or remedied, as by another, wor|thy to &s;ucceed him, reigning in his &s;tead; e&s;pecially one de&s;cended, from him, and in whom he may be con&s;idered as, in &s;ome &s;ort, &s;till living and reigning. Such is the con&s;olation that gracious heaven affords to us, and to three kingdoms, at this &s;ea&s;on of our common mourning. And both rea&s;on and religion as much require that we gracefully receive the con|&s;olation offered, as that we humbly lay to heart that event of providence, by which we came to need it.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="008925_0006_1030339622127D08">IT becomes us as men, and e&s;pecially as chri&s;ti|ans, on this occa&s;ion to look up to the &s;overeign ruler of the univer&s;e, who "removeth kings and &s;etteth up kings", as &s;eemeth good in his &s;ight. Him we are to con&s;ider as the author of tho&s;e revoltuions, and other great changes, which take place from age to age in the kingdoms of this world; and &s;hould make a religious improvement of the pre&s;ent di&s;pen|&s;ations of his providence towards us. It is with a view at a&s;&s;i&s;ting you in &s;o important a duty, that I have cho&s;en the words ju&s;t now read, for the &s;ubject of my di&s;cour&s;e at this time&mdash;"The mo&s;t High ruleth in the kingdom of men." The words occur three &s;everal times in this fourth chapter of Daniel; which con&s;i&s;ts of a manife&s;to, or &s;olemn declaration, which Nebuchadnezzar the great king of Babylon publi&s;hed "to all people, nations and languages"; and which the prophet, for the honor of God's name, thought proper, it &s;eems, to pre&s;erve intire with his own writings, to be tran&s;mitted to future gene|rations. Nebuchadnezzar is &s;poken of in &s;cripture as one of the greate&s;t monarchs that ever lived in the world. "Thou, O king", &s;aid Daniel to him, "art a king of kings; for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and &s;trength and glory. And where&s;oever the children of men dwell, the bea&s;ts of the field, and the fowls of heaven hath he delivered into thy hand <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chap. II. ver. 37, 38.</NOTE>". Prophane hi&s;tory &s;peaks of him conformably to this account <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">He is &s;aid to have held in &s;ubjection Syria, Phenicia, Arabia and Egypt. "Strabo likewi&s;e a&s;&s;erts that this king among the Chaldeans was more celebrated than Hercules, and that he proceeded as far as the pillars of Hercules [near the &s;treights of Gibralter] and led his army out of Spain into Thrace and Pontus." Vid. Dr. Newton's XIIIth <HI>Di&s;&s;ertation on Prophecy.</HI></NOTE>. He
<PB N="10" REF="008925_0007_10303399011CE1B0">was as proud and impious as he was great. And God &s;eems to have rai&s;ed him up as he did Pharaoh, that he might "&s;hew his power in him, and that his name might be declared throughout all the earth". It &s;eems that he was for a time much alarmed, and even convinced, by the miraculous deliverance of the three pious Jews from the fiery furnace, whom he had ordered to be ca&s;t into it for not wor&s;hipping the golden image which he had &s;et up; and he made a decree, that no one &s;hould &s;peak again&s;t the God whom the&s;e men wor&s;hipped.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dan. C. III. v. 29.</NOTE> But his heart, like Pharaoh's, re&s;umed its former hardne&s;s; and was &s;o lifted up with pride, that God re&s;olved to humble him in a very &s;ignal manner. And the main de&s;ign of his manife&s;to, contained in this IVth Chapter of Daniel, is to declare to all the world the wonderful means by which God did this; by which he con|vinced him of his &s;upreme dominion, his power and providence, and the wi&s;dom and ju&s;tice of all his deal|ings with the children of men. So that this may be called the proclamation whereby that mighty, and once impious monarch, recognized God's univer&s;al dominion, as the King of kings and Lord of lords. "I thought it good"," &s;ays he, "to &s;hew the &s;igns and wonders that the high God hath wrought towards me. For how great are his &s;igns? and how mighty are his wonders? His kingdom is an everla&s;ting king|dom", &amp;c. He then proceeds particularly to relate what had happened to him; the a&s;toni&s;hing &s;igns by which God humbled his proud heart, and made him confe&s;s, that he indeed "ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whom&s;oever he will." What the&s;e &s;igns and wonders were, I now forbear particu|larly to mention, le&s;t my di&s;cour&s;e &s;hould be drawn out to too great a length. But in general, he had
<PB N="11" REF="008925_0008_1030339ADBFCD350">a remarkable dream, or vi&s;ion, wherein, under the &s;imilitude of cutting down a mighty tree, was, accord|ing to the prophet's interpretation, prefigured his own fall from his greatne&s;s, and his being driven from men. And when the king &s;aid, "Is not this great Babylon that I have built for the hou&s;e of the kingdom, by the might of my power, and for the honor of my maje&s;ty? While the word was in the kings mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, &s;aying, O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is &s;poken, The kingdom is departed from thee," &amp;c. And "the &s;ame hour was the thing fulfilled upon Ne|buchadnezzar." Of which event we find the prophet afterwards giving the following account to his &s;on Bel&s;hazzar&mdash;"All people, nations and languages trembled and feared before him: whom he would he &s;lew, and whom he would he kept alive, and whom he would he &s;et up, and whom he would he put down. But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind har|dened in pride, he was depo&s;ed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him: And he was driven from the &s;ons of men&mdash;till he knew that the mo&s;t high God ruled in the kingdom of men, and that he appointeth over it whom&s;oever he will <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chap. V. ver. 19, 20, 21.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>THUS wonderfully was this great king brought down, till at the end of the days appointed, he lift up his eyes to heaven, and his under&s;tanding re|turned unto him. And he concludes his proclamation in the &s;trong and emphatical terms following, which di&s;cover an heart very deeply impre&s;t with what had befallen him for his former pride, tyranny and impiety &mdash;"Now I Nebuchadnezzar", &s;ays he, "prai&s;e, and extol, and honor the king of heaven, all who&s;e works are truth, and his ways judgment; and tho&s;e that walk in pride he is able to aba&s;e".</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="008925_0009_1030339D79C17DF0">But to return; The words of the text may be con&s;idered as an intire, independent &s;entence, tho' they indeed make but a part of one, as they &s;tand in the &s;everal places where they occur in this chapter. In this light it is propo&s;ed to con&s;ider them; and they will, I &s;uppo&s;e, be a proper introduction to &s;ome reflexions on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, as they a&s;&s;ert God's &s;upreme dominion in and over the kingdoms of men.</P>
<P>FOR the illu&s;tration of this &s;ubject, it is to be ob|&s;erved fir&s;t in general,</P>
<P N="1">I. THAT all nations, all kingdoms, are in the hand of God, who has an original right, and ab&s;olute pow|er over them. He hath made of one blood all na|tions for to dwell upon the face of the earth; and has the intire di&s;po&s;al of them. The ab&s;olute &s;ove|reignty of God over all nations, is repre&s;ented in very &s;trong and &s;ublime language by Nebuchadnezzar in this chapter, after his rea&s;on returned to him. "His kingdom", &s;aith he, "is from generation to generation: And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing; and he doeth according to his will in the ar|my of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can &s;tay his hand, or &s;ay unto him, What doe&s;t thou?" The prophet I&s;aiah expre&s;&s;eth him&s;elf upon this &s;ubject in language not le&s;s emphatical. "Behold, the nations are as a drop of the bucket", &s;aith he, "and are counted as the &s;mall du&s;t of the balance: behold, he taketh up the i&s;les as a very little thing &mdash; all nations before him are as nothing, and they are counted to him as le&s;s than nothing and va|nity". And a little after in the &s;ame chapter&mdash;"It is he that &s;itteth upon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as gra&s;shoppers; that &s;tretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and &s;pread|eth
<PB N="13" REF="008925_0010_103033A0133A12C8">them out as a tent to dwell in; that bringeth the princes to nothing: He maketh the judges of the earth as vanity". [Chap. XL.]</P>
<P>NOW, God's ruling in the kingdom of men, ex|pre&s;&s;eth in general that &s;upreme power, that uncon|troulable dominion, which he exerci&s;eth over all na|tions from one generation to another: Not only his right and power, but his actual government over them. For his ruling in the kingdom of men, implies his continual agency and providence therein, and his reigning over them as a &s;overeign Lord; not merely his power and authority to do &s;o. And accordingly, whatever befals &s;tates and kingdoms; their ri&s;e, en|largement and pro&s;perity, their fall, their declen&s;ion, and the various calamities that happen to them, are in &s;cripture attributed to God's over-ruling providence, as the accompli&s;hment of his &s;overeign plea&s;ure con|cerning them. And that the&s;e things are ju&s;tly a&s;|cribed to him, is evident from many con&s;iderations; particularly from his having enabled his prophets to foretel, many ages before-hand, the changes and re|volutions which &s;hould take place among the nations of the earth: Which predictions have been punctu|ally verified by the event.</P>
<P>THUS the ancient prophecies re&s;pecting the Jews, the Egyptians, the Babylonians, the Ninevites, the Trojans, and many other nations, have long &s;ince had a mo&s;t exact and &s;urpri&s;ing accompli&s;hment; as any one, acquainted with the prophecies, and with what has &s;ince actually befallen tho&s;e nations, mu&s;t ac|knowledge <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Many of the&s;e predictions, together with their re&s;pective ac|compli&s;hments, are &s;et in a clear and &s;trong light in the Rev. and very learned Dr. Newton's Di&s;&s;ertations on prophecy, Vol. I.</NOTE>. And in this book of Daniel's prophe|cies,
<PB N="14" REF="008925_0011_103033A2A96AA940">was foretold, with an a&s;toni&s;hing preci&s;ion, tho' in figurative language, what &s;hould come to pa&s;s in the four great &s;ucce&s;&s;ive monarchies, or empires of the world; the A&s;&s;yrian or Babylonian, the Medo-Per&s;ian, the Macedonian and the Roman; in, or during, the latter of which, the God of heaven was to &s;et up a kingdom of a peculiar kind, which &s;hould never have an end, or be left to other people: "And the king|dom, and the dominion, and the greatne&s;s of the kingdom under the whole heaven, &s;hall [at length] be given to the people of the &s;aints of the mo&s;t High, who&s;e kingdom is an everla&s;ting kingdom; and all dominions &s;hall &s;erve and obey him"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. VII. ver. 27.</NOTE>. Nor is the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the Jews, or indeed the ge|neral &s;tate of the chri&s;tian world at this day, any thing le&s;s than a demon&s;tration of the truth of pro|phecy: which is, at the &s;ame time, a kind of vi&s;ible demon&s;tration of the truth and reality of God's rul|ing in the kingdom of men. For, certainly none but he, who hath the fates and fortunes of all nations in his own hand, and the mo&s;t ab&s;olute di&s;po&s;al of them, could po&s;&s;ibly enable men &s;o particularly and exactly to foretel what &s;hould befal them in remote ages, as the prophets have actually done. And the accom|pli&s;hment of &s;o many prophecies already, as it is an undeniable proof that the world is governed by di|vine providence, &s;o it gives us an a&s;&s;urance, that tho&s;e predictions in the&s;e &s;acred books, which &s;till remain unfulfilled, &s;hall al&s;o have their accompli&s;hment at the appointed time; when "the my&s;tery of God &s;hall be fini&s;hed, as he hath declared to his &s;ervants the prophets". But,</P>
<P N="2">II. GOD's ruling in the kingdom of men, may expre&s;s more particularly and directly that authority and &s;overeign power, which he exerci&s;eth from age
<PB N="15" REF="008925_0012_103033A52FEE3BB0">to age over the kings and potentates of the earth; and which truly denominate him the King of kings and Lord of lords. <HI>That</HI> being may well be &s;aid to rule in the kingdom of men, on whom all earthly kings are entirely dependent; who rai&s;eth one to a throne, and ca&s;teth down another; who gives to all kings their authority, and limits them in the exerci&s;e there|of; who gives them whatever qualifications they have for ruling; who al&s;o gives to their lives and reigns, either a &s;horter or longer term, as he plea&s;eth; who makes their reign either a ble&s;&s;ing to the kingdoms which they govern, or the contrary; and who will finally judge even them in righteou&s;ne&s;s. With the greate&s;t truth and propriety may he be &s;aid to rule and govern in the kingdom of men, who exerci&s;eth &s;uch a dominion over the monarchs of the world. And to enlarge a little here cannot, I &s;uppo&s;e, be thought improper on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion.</P>
<P N="1">1. GOD ruleth in the kingdom of men, as all earthly kings derive their power and authority ori|ginally from him; or as they reign by his permi&s;&s;ion and providence, and as his mini&s;ters. This is in effect a&s;&s;erted in the words immediately following the text&mdash; "and giveth it" [i.e. the kingdom] "to whom&s;oever he will", in the exerci&s;e of that &s;ove|reign dominion which he hath over all. In confor|mity whereto, the prophet addre&s;&s;eth him&s;elf thus to Bel&s;hazzar, the &s;on and &s;ucce&s;&s;or of Nebuchadnezzar. "O thou king, the mo&s;t high God <HI>gave</HI> Nebuch|adnezzar thy father a kingdom, and maje&s;ty, and glory. and honor <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chap. V. ver. 18.</NOTE>." And the apo&s;tle Paul a&s;&s;erts in a more general way, and without any exception, that "there is no power but of God"; that "the powers that be are ordained of God"; and that kings, and indeed other inferior rulers, are "God's mini&s;ters", ap|pointed
<PB N="16" REF="008925_0013_103033A819C10480">to govern the world under him, the Lord of all; and to carry on the de&s;igns of his providence therein. So that human government, being duly ad|mini&s;tred, is in effect the government of God. For which rea&s;on we are admoni&s;hed to be &s;ubject "to every ordinance of man for the Lord's &s;ake, whether it be to the king as &s;upreme, or unto governors as unto them that are &s;ent by him for the puni&s;hment of evil-doers, and for the prai&s;e of them that do well <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. II. 13, 14.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>GOD does not indeed, by any immediate act of his own, place a crown upon the head, and put a &s;cep|ter in the hand of him, whom he has ordained to reign, and &s;eat him upon a royal throne. He leaves nations (ordinarily, I mean) to the free exerci&s;e of their liberty and di&s;cretion, under the general law of rea&s;on, to chu&s;e their own forms of government, and to model them as be&s;t &s;uits them re&s;pectively. Some nations neither have, nor are required to have, any kings at all. Some crowns are, properly &s;peaking, elective, by the fundamental laws of the kingdom. In other kingdoms the crown is hereditary, either with certain limitations and exceptions, or without any, according to the various con&s;titutions of different king|doms; which con&s;titutions them&s;elves are not, however, ab&s;olutely immutable. In all which re&s;pects it may truly be &s;aid, that nations are left to the exerci&s;e of their natural di&s;cretion and liberty. But &s;till religion, and even rea&s;on, teaches us to acknowledge the hand and providence of God in the exaltation of any par|ticular per&s;on to a throne. In elective kingdoms the thoughts and coun&s;els of the electors are, tho' imper|ceptibly, &s;o over-ruled, that the choice falls at la&s;t upon him, whom God had ordained to reign; and thus, without knowing his purpo&s;e, they fulfil his
<PB N="17" REF="008925_0014_103033AAD169C380">&s;overeign plea&s;ure. And where the crown is here|ditary according to the con&s;titution, God in his pro|vidence often interrupts and defeats the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, either by the death of the pre&s;umptive heir, or by other means; and &s;ometimes the crown devolves at la&s;t to one, &s;o remote from it by blood, that he was very unlikely ever to wear it, according to hu|man rules of judging; or it is perhaps transferred to another race. The&s;e things are common, and well known; by which God &s;hews his own &s;overeignty in the kingdom of men, and makes it manife&s;t that he "gives it to whom&s;oever he will".</P>
<P N="2">2. GOD ruleth in the kingdom of men, as all earthly kings derive from him whatever qualifications and abilities they have for reigning, as well as their authority. How great? how important, is the differ|ence between a wi&s;e and good, and a weak and bad king? The welfare of nations, under God, depends very much upon the talents and character of the kings, whom he exalteth to reign over them. Nor is it le&s;s evident that he be&s;tows the various gifts and talents by which kings are di&s;tingui&s;hed from one another, than it is that they reign by his permi&s;&s;ion, and providential ordination. Wi&s;dom, magnanimity, and other royal qualities, are the gift of God; of which none are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in any greater degree, than he &s;aw fit to be&s;tow them, in order to accompli&s;h his own wi&s;e and holy purpo&s;es. And from &s;ome the&s;e qualities are withheld, with the &s;ame general de&s;ign. For, according to the holy &s;criptures, important events are brought about in nations, and in the &s;tate of the world, as well by the folly and infatuation of &s;ome kings, as by the wi&s;dom of others; all in conformity to the will and purpo&s;es of heaven. And this is one way, in which God manife&s;ts his own &s;overeignty in the kingdom of men.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="18" REF="008925_0015_103033ADD6F1A070">3. GOD ruleth in the kingdom of men, by &s;uc|ceeding the admini&s;tration of kings, and by making them great public ble&s;&s;ings, or the contrary, according to his own plea&s;ure. Mo&s;t commonly indeed, wi&s;e and good kings reign &s;ucce&s;sfully, while weak and wicked ones prove rather a cur&s;e than a ble&s;&s;ing. This is not, however, univer&s;ally the ca&s;e. It is ob|vious that the &s;ucce&s;s or pro&s;perity of an admini&s;tra|tion, does not &s;olely depend upon, nor is always in exact proportion to, the wi&s;dom, ju&s;tice, fortitude, and other princely virtues of him that &s;its upon the throne. The views and endeavours of the be&s;t kings are &s;ome|times fru&s;trated; while tho&s;e of far inferior ones are crowned with &s;ucce&s;s, both in peace and war. It is God that giveth &s;alvation unto kings, and thereby to kingdoms: He it is, that bringeth them down. And both the&s;e he does, in &s;uch ways, and by &s;uch means, as plainly evince his &s;overeignty in the kingdom of men; and &s;hew to kings and kingdoms at once, their ab&s;olute dependence upon him for pro&s;perity. How many great and common calamities are there, which befal nations from time to time, that the wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t powerful monarchs can neither prevent nor re|move? And how many public ble&s;&s;ings are there, which kings have little, or perhaps no hand at all, in procuring? Riches, and honor, and power, and all national ble&s;&s;ings, mu&s;t be acknowledged to come ori|ginally from God, &s;ometimes by the in&s;trumentality of kings, and &s;ometimes without it; and in his "hand it is to make great, and to give &s;trength unto all".</P>
<P N="4">4. GOD ruleth in the kingdom of men, as he gives to the reign of earthly kings either a &s;horter or longer term, as &s;eemeth good in his &s;ight. Mighty monarchs are &s;ometimes "depo&s;ed from their kingly thrones" for their &s;ins, as Nebuchadnezzar was. When his
<PB N="19" REF="008925_0016_103033B01ED5F390">mind was hardened in pride, it was &s;aid unto him, "The kingdom is departed from thee"; and in&s;tantly, his glory was taken away, and he was "driven from men". Bel&s;hazzar his &s;on did not profit by his example; and therefore met with a &s;till more fatal overthrow. No &s;ooner had the hand upon the wall written his doom, and Daniel interpreted it,&mdash;"God hath numbered thy kingdom, and fini&s;hed it", &amp;c. than he was &s;lain; "and Darius the Median took the kingdom". How many other proud, arbitrary and tyrannical princes, who have thought them&s;elves above all controul, have &s;uddenly been brought down to the du&s;t? either expelled their kingdoms, or come to an untimely end, and left their thrones to others? Nor is the &s;overeignty of God in the kingdom of men, le&s;s manife&s;ted in depriving earthly kings of their power and dominion, than in conferring them at fir&s;t. In the language of the royal p&s;almi&s;t, "Promotion cometh neither from the ea&s;t, nor from the we&s;t, not from the &s;outh. But God is the judge: he putteth down one, and &s;etteth up another <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm LXXV. 6, 7.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>BESIDES: It is appointed unto all men, and no le&s;s to kings, even great and good kings, than others, once to die; and to give an account of them&s;elves to God. Their greatne&s;s exempts them neither from the com|mon mortality, nor from the righteous judgment of God, in who&s;e hand their breath is. From &s;ome the great arbiter of life and death, &s;oon taketh away their breath, even in early youth; &s;o that they hardly know what it is to wear a crown, before they are commanded to re&s;ign it; and called to appear before the high tribunal of him that "regardeth not the per&s;ons of princes". Other kings are taken away in the mid&s;t of their years; and all their devices, pro|jections
<PB N="20" REF="008925_0017_103033B2E47000C0">and de&s;igns, whether good or bad, are at once brought to nothing; &s;ometimes to the joy, and &s;ome|times to the &s;orrow of their &s;ubjects; and not only of their own &s;ubjects, but of other nations. To other kings God is plea&s;ed to grant length of days, and a reign of many years; &s;o that they are &s;atisfied with life, and &s;ee many happy effects of their reign, be|fore their days are numbered and fini&s;hed. Now, God manife&s;teth his &s;overeignty over the kings and poten|tates of the earth, by cutting &s;hort, or protracting their life and reign, in this manner: And hereby, in part, it appears, that he indeed ruleth in the kingdom of men.</P>
<P>It may, not improperly, be added here, that a great deal depends upon the time, and particular cir|cum&s;tances, wherein kings are taken out of this world. There are, with re&s;pect to their &s;ubjects at lea&s;t, I might &s;ay with re&s;pect to them&s;elves al&s;o, both fa|vourable and unfavourable conjunctures for them to die in. As the ca&s;e may be circum&s;tanced, the death of a king, tho' of no very eminent qualities and ver|tues, may be of fatal con&s;equence to a kingdom: As, for example, when the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is left doubtful, different per&s;ons laying claim to it, and each of them &s;upported by powerful factions. In this ca&s;e, how often have nations been thrown into confu&s;ion, and involved in all the calamities of a civil war? Or, tho' the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is uncontroverted, yet if the heir be not arrived at an age proper for governing a king|dom, the death of a king in the&s;e circum&s;tances is a great calamity: For "Wo to thee, O Land," &s;ays Solomon, "when thy king is a child." God &s;ome|times cha&s;tizeth nations by removing their kings at &s;uch unfavourable conjunctures as the&s;e, and others that might ea&s;ily be mentioned. And tho' the death
<PB N="21" REF="008925_0018_103033B58FEA2090">of good kings will always be &s;incerely lamented by good and dutiful &s;ubjects; yet it mu&s;t be owned that, in certain circum&s;tances, the death even of &s;uch kings can hardly be looked upon as a frown of divine pro|vidence, in any other &s;en&s;e than that, in which the common mortality of mankind is &s;o. As, for exam|ple, if they die when they are far advanced in years; when they are almo&s;t pa&s;t bearing the weight of go|vernment; when their kingdoms are in flouri&s;hing circum&s;tances; when the &s;ucce&s;ion is undi&s;puted; or there are no parties or factions powerful enough to create public troubles and commotions; when the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or is of mature age for wielding a &s;ceptre, and is endowed with &s;uch princely virtues, as naturally in|&s;pire the hopes of great happine&s;s under his reign: When all the&s;e circum&s;tances take place, they great|ly alleviate that &s;orrow which all good &s;ubjects mu&s;t in &s;ome degree feel, on the death of a good king. And God's &s;overeignty in the kingdoms of men plain|ly appears by the particular time and conjuncture, wherein he removeth kings out of this world: For, that the&s;e circum&s;tances, whether favourable or other|wi&s;e, together with the duration of each monarch's life, and the length of his reign, are all fixed, all de|termined by the mo&s;t High, no man who believes a providence, can con&s;i&s;tently doubt.</P>
<P>UPON the whole (for I mu&s;t not enlarge): God does not only &s;hew him&s;elf &s;overeign in the kingdom of men, by the per&s;ons whom he exalteth to earthly thrones, by the various qualifications which he be|&s;tows upon them, by pro&s;pering or not pro&s;pering their reign, by &s;ometimes ca&s;ting them down from their thrones before their lives are come to a period, and by the particular time and circum&s;tances wherein they are re&s;pectively taken out of this world by death:
<PB N="22" REF="008925_0019_103033B82C7A6DC8">He does not hereby only &s;hew his &s;overeign pow|er in and over the kingdom of men, but he al&s;o manife&s;ts hereby his favor and goodne&s;s towards na|tions, or his righteous di&s;plea&s;ure. He executeth loving-kindne&s;s, judgment and righteou&s;ne&s;s in the earth, by the di&s;pen&s;ations of his providence towards kings and kingdoms. The welfare of nations im|mediately depends, in a great mea&s;ure, upon the kings whom God placeth over them. It is &s;aid of I&s;rael, with reference to Saul, that God "gave them a king in his anger" After a while, he brought about a <HI>revolution</HI> in that kingdom, and gave them David in his kindne&s;s, a man after his own heart, who was a great ble&s;&s;ing to the nation. And when David died in a good old age, after a pro&s;perous reign, and when he had in a manner &s;ubdued all their enemies, his &s;on Solomon &s;ucceeded him in the throne, whom the queen of Sheba addre&s;&s;ed in the equally pious and courtly terms following: <Q>Ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord thy God which delighted in thee to &s;et thee upon his throne, to be king for the Lord thy God. Becau&s;e thy God loved I&s;rael, to e&s;tabli&s;h them forever, therefore made he thee king over them to do judgment and ju&s;tice.</Q></P>
<P>IT being evident then, from what has been &s;aid, that God ruleth in the kingdom of men, giving it to whom|&s;oever he will; and al&s;o, that his favor and righteous di&s;plea&s;ure are manife&s;ted towards different nations; or towards the &s;ame nations at different times, by the "manner of the kings that reign over them", and by the time and circum&s;tances of their removal out of this world: The&s;e things being evident. I &s;ay, what &s;till remains, is, that we apply this &s;ubject to our|&s;elves, and to the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, by making &s;ome reflexions on the reign and death of his late maje&s;ty,
<PB N="23" REF="008925_0020_103033BAC3D30CB8">and on the acce&s;&s;ion of George III. to the imperial throne of Great-Britain.</P>
<P>AND it will not, as is humbly conceived, be im|proper here, in the fir&s;t place, to take a cur&s;ory view of the providential means, by which the Briti&s;h crown devolved to the illu&s;trious hou&s;e of Hanover, and con|&s;equently to his late, and his pre&s;ent maje&s;ty. For &s;uch a retro&s;pect on the events of divine providence, at the &s;ame time that it will be a farther illu&s;tration of God's ruling in the kingdom of men, and giving it to whom&s;oever he will, may al&s;o &s;erve to e&s;tabli&s;h us in the principles of true Briti&s;h liberty, and of loy|alty to his pre&s;ent maje&s;ty, as founded in, and re&s;ult|ing from, tho&s;e principles. Nor will you, I am per|&s;uaded, think I go beyond my proper &s;phere, if, upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion I inculcate loyalty, and obedience to the e&s;tabli&s;hed government; and this upon the very principles on which that government is founded, in oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e of de&s;poti&s;m and tyranny.</P>
<P>LET me remind you then, that after the death <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In the year 1603.</NOTE> of queen Elizabeth, (the glory of who&s;e reign, other|wi&s;e truly great, was ob&s;cur'd and tarni&s;hed by re|ligious per&s;ecution) it plea&s;ed God, doubtle&s;s for the &s;ins of the nation, to rai&s;e four princes &s;ucce&s;&s;ively to the throne, who&s;e reigns were all inglorious, and &s;ome of them infamous to the la&s;t degree; princes of great pride and vanity, of arbitrary notions and practices, of little wi&s;dom, policy or di&s;cretion, and &s;till le&s;s truth, &s;incerity and honor; princes who were always the dupes of our ancient, enterpri&s;ing and dangerous enemies, of je&s;uits, popi&s;h mini&s;ters or po|pi&s;h wives; princes who&s;e reigns di&s;graced the nation abroad, and were &s;ore vi&s;itations of divine providence upon it.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="008925_0021_103033BD2FFF3370">THE la&s;t of the&s;e four kings whom the mo&s;t High gave us in his anger, James II, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He &s;ucceeded his brother Charles II. in 1684.</NOTE> was an open, profe&s;&s;ed and bigotted roman-catholic; who &s;tuck at no mea&s;ures in order to introduce the religion of Rome, to de&s;poil the Briti&s;h nations of their ancient liberties, and to entail upon them the two-fold cur&s;e of popery and &s;lavery; which have indeed a clo&s;e connexion one with the other. The king daily made prodigious &s;trides towards a de&s;potic power; to e&s;tabli&s;h which on the ruins of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, was his manife&s;t aim. And he doubtle&s;s promi&s;ed him&s;elf &s;ucce&s;s in this execra|ble de&s;ign, by reflecting on that &s;eries of events in and after the reign of his father, from which he ought to have drawn other conclu&s;ions. That unhappy prince, king Charles I. by favouring the papi&s;ts contrary to law, and many flagrant violations of the con&s;titution, had involved the nation in a civil war; a war entered into on one &s;ide, in defence of public liberty, on the other, in the &s;upport of tyranny; and which did not end but with the ruin, both of the con&s;titution, and of the infatuated prince who had been the blameable cau&s;e of it. King James &s;eem'd to take it for granted, that the nation would never again, at lea&s;t not &s;o &s;oon, have recour&s;e to arms, or re&s;i&s;tance, in defence of its rights and liberties; but rather &s;ubmit to the mo&s;t cruel tyranny, than attempt to rid it&s;elf of it by tho&s;e means which, however nece&s;&s;ary, had been attended with &s;uch di&s;mal con&s;equences: E&s;pecially as the doc|trine of pa&s;&s;ive obedience and non-re&s;i&s;tance had, ever &s;ince the <HI>re&s;toration,</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In 1660.</NOTE> been the e&s;tabli&s;hed doctrine, which no one could contradict with impunity. It had, however, been a more ju&s;t, as well as more &s;afe inference, that the brave people who had lately made
<PB N="25" REF="008925_0022_103033BF9B4356F0">&s;uch efforts in defence of their liberties, would not now tamely &s;ubmit to arbitrary &s;way; but again have re|cour&s;e to &s;ome extraordinary means of &s;elf-defence, if driven to extremities, whatever doctrines they might profe&s;s to believe. But&mdash; <HI>Quem Deus vult perdere, pri&ugrave;s dementat</HI>&mdash; Tho&s;e whom God de&s;igns to de|&s;troy, he fir&s;t infatuates; &s;o that they re&s;olutely per|&s;i&s;t in &s;uch mea&s;ures, as mu&s;t needs terminate in their ruin. The king was deaf to all the remon&s;trances of rea&s;on and ju&s;tice, of policy and intere&s;t; and would &s;uffer no check in his mad career to de&s;truction. Nor was there, perhaps, ever another king, to whom the words of the prophet to Bel&s;hazzar, were more appli|cable than to this prince, whom neither the fate of his unhappy father, nor any thing el&s;e, could keep from de&s;troying him&s;elf&mdash; <Q>O thou king, the mo&s;t high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom&mdash; But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride, he was depo&s;ed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him.

<P>IN this critical conjuncture, it plea&s;ed him who ru|leth in the kingdom of men, not only to open the eyes of all the friends to public liberty and the prote&s;|tant religion, to &s;ee the common danger which threat|ned them, but al&s;o to unite their hearts and coun&s;els in an extraordinary manner to guard again&s;t it. Party-di&s;tinctions, which had hitherto run very high, were now laid a&s;ide. The illu&s;trious prince of Orange, the king's &s;on-in-law, who was known to be at once a lo|ver

<P>THIS was a new and memorable aera in the Engli&s;h hi&s;tory. The <HI>declaration of rights</HI> pre&s;ented and read to William and Mary, when they were invited into the throne, a&s;certained the rights of the &s;ubject, and reduced the prerogative, which had been extended be|yond all bounds in many preceeding reigns, to its an|tient limits. It was declared by the two conventions before-mentioned, that the kings of England held the crown by virtue of an "original contract," in oppo|&s;ition to the notions of an indefea&s;eable hereditary right: And this was the ba&s;is on which the govern|ment was &s;ettled. Provi&s;ion was now made by many
<PB N="28" REF="008925_0025_103033C7A1AC6C20">parliamentary acts, for &s;ecuring the public liberty, and the future peace and pro&s;perity of the nation. To which ends, among&s;t other things, the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown was limited to the prote&s;tant line of the royal family, and all romancatholics, however nearly relat|ed to it by blood, declared forever incapable of reign|ing in England. The like was done in North-Britain, at that time a di&s;tinct kingdom.</P>
<P>KING William and Queen Mary being dead with|out leaving i&s;&s;ue, the prince&s;s Ann, a prote&s;tant, and a daughter of the then lately out-lawed king James, a&s;cended the throne in conformity to the parliamen|tary &s;ettlement of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. In her reign the union between North and South-Britain, which king William had zealou&s;ly recommended before, was hap|pily accompli&s;hed. An union, which the author of nature had pointed out between two nations on the &s;ame i&s;land; both lovers of liberty, both brave and warlike, both generally prote&s;tant; mutually &s;tanding in need of one another's a&s;&s;i&s;tance again&s;t their com|mon enemies; and who&s;e &s;ituation, and martial &s;pirit, whenever they were at variance, had render'd them &s;ore &s;courges to each other. Queen Ann, tho' a Stewart, reigned not without reputation and glory, till one or two of the la&s;t years of her life, when &s;he had fallen into the hands of bad mini&s;ters and coun&s;ellors. Her &s;on, the duke of Glouce&s;ter, who was otherwi&s;e to have &s;ucceeded her, died the year before &s;he came to the throne. <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">He died in 1700, being in the 11th year of his age.

<P>BUT &s;ome may po&s;&s;ibly expect, that I &s;hould &s;ay &s;omething more particularly concerning his late ma|je&s;ty. And indeed, tho' I cannot pretend to give his ju&s;t character, yet it would be hardly decent to pa&s;s over his many royal virtues in &s;ilence; or to bury &s;o good and venerable a king, without recollecting &s;ome of tho&s;e things, which ought to make us honour his memory.</P>
<P>HIS late maje&s;ty was unque&s;tionably endow'd with a brillant genius; with a great &s;hare of natural pe|netration and &s;agacity Nor was that genius unculti|vated by learning; &s;uch learning e&s;pecially as be|comes a king. He is &s;aid to have been extremely well ver&s;ed in hi&s;tory, particularly that of Europe; and to have had a very thorough under&s;tanding of the po|litical intere&s;ts and connexions of all the kingdoms and &s;tates therein. Without which it would indeed
<PB N="31" REF="008925_0028_103033CF6C874EA8">have been impo&s;&s;ible for him to maintain his character as the chief bulwark of its liberties, and of the pro|te&s;tant religion, as he actually was. As he came into England at about thirty two years of age, and lived there about twelve years before he came to the throne, he had, during that period, an opportunity to acquaint him&s;elf, not only with the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, but with the peculiar temper and genius of the people. Nor could he fail to reap great advantage from the in&s;titutions, the political maxims, and the example of &s;o wi&s;e a king, as his royal father. And he was, like him, what may be properly called, a con&s;titutional king: One who well knew both the extent of his own prerogative, and the rights of the people; one who made the laws the rule of his government, and whom even malice can hardly accu&s;e of either doing, or attempting to do, an arbitrary, illegal thing, during his whole reign. And it &s;hould be remember'd here, that the Briti&s;h con&s;titution and laws are &s;o wi&s;e, &s;o excellent, that he who uniformly makes them the rule of his admini&s;tration, mu&s;t of con&s;equence be a good king; at lea&s;t he cannot ea&s;ily be &s;uppo&s;ed to be a bad one.</P>
<P>AND merely not to have been a bad king, is per|haps grater prai&s;e than is due to far the mo&s;t of tho&s;e, who have reigned from the days of Nimrod to the pre&s;ent time. But to &s;top here, would be very in|jurious to the character and memory of his late maje&s;ty. He appeared, throughout his reign, to have the true intere&s;t and honour of Great-Britain at heart; know|ing that kings, e&s;pecially Briti&s;h kings, are made for the people, and not people for kings. Notwith&s;tand|ing &s;ome [to us] unhappy, but yet nece&s;&s;ary and un|avoidable <HI>connexions,</HI> we have rea&s;on to think that his maje&s;ty's uniform and great aim was, to promote
<PB N="32" REF="008925_0029_103033D2120A31D0">the good of his kingdoms. He was indeed indefa|tigable in his endeavours to this end; and, in the language of the apo&s;tle, "attended continually on this very thing". He was an encourager of learning, of manufactures and commerce; the two latter of which, I &s;uppo&s;e, never flouri&s;hed &s;o much in Great-Britan, as under his au&s;picious reign.</P>
<P>HIS maje&s;ty was at once a prince of great ju&s;tice and great clemency. The former was evident from his care to have the laws duly executed, without re|&s;pect of per&s;ons; and his not allowing the meane&s;t of his &s;ubjects to be oppre&s;&s;ed, &s;o far as it was in the power of a Briti&s;h king to prevent it. Nor were private property, the life and rights of the &s;ubject, ever more &s;ecure perhaps, than under his admini&s;tra|tion. His maje&s;ty's clemency appeared in many in|&s;tances; but in none more con&s;picuou&s;ly, than in his conduct towards tho&s;e who were engaged in the black rebellion of 1745. Very few examples were made of royal ju&s;tice, after that horrid rebellion was at a period. But how many traitors, even obliged, and therefore ungrateful ones, were made examples of the royal grace! His maje&s;ty had a greatne&s;s of mind, which made him chu&s;e rather to reclaim his rebelli|ous &s;ubjects by his lenity, than to rid him&s;elf of them by a ju&s;tifiable &s;everity. And there is rea&s;on to think, that this truly god-like method of proceeding had a great and happy effect; and was the means, not only of reconciling, but &s;trongly attaching to his per|&s;on and government, many people who had been un|rea&s;onably di&s;affected thereto before.</P>
<P>HIS maje&s;ty, like his royal father, was a prince of an heroic and martial &s;pirit: A lover, indeed, of peace; but one who would not &s;uffer him&s;elf or his &s;ubjects
<PB N="33" REF="008925_0030_103033D48C73B6B0">to be injured without taking up the &s;word, when that mea&s;ure became nece&s;&s;ary. He was a king, not only of great &s;pirit and re&s;olution, and the mo&s;t undaunted fortitude; but one who well knew how to command armies in the field, when there was occa&s;ion for it: Of which he gave &s;ome not inglorious proofs.</P>
<P>HIS maje&s;ty was a prince, even by the confe&s;&s;ion of his enemies, many of them at lea&s;t, of great &s;incerity and truth, of &s;trict probity and honor, in all his public tran&s;actions, both towards his own &s;ubjects and towards foreign &s;tates and kingdom. He was far above that deceit, artifice, and low-cunning, for which mo&s;t of the Stewart race were &s;o eminent, the <HI>royal martyr</HI> him|&s;elf not excepted. In &s;hort, his whole reign was a confutation of that infamous Machiavellian maxim, "Qui ne&s;cit di&s;&s;imulare, ne&s;cit regnare"&mdash;He that knows not how to di&s;&s;emble, is ignorant of the art of reigning.</P>
<P>IT was intimated above, that his maje&s;ty was a true prote&s;tant. As &s;uch he was a friend to toleration, and religious liberty; which cannot indeed be violated without violating the natural rights of mankind. His maje&s;ty did not affect, as <HI>defender of the faith,</HI> to make his own private judgment and con&s;cience a rule to his &s;ubjects, or to tyrannize over their con&s;ciences. Nor did he, as <HI>head of the church</HI> by law e&s;tabli&s;hed in En|gland, endeavour to de&s;troy the church equally e&s;ta|bli&s;hed by law in Scotland; or de&s;ire to di&s;tre&s;s any of his good prote&s;tant &s;ubjects, who might, in &s;ome re&s;pects, di&s;&s;ent from them both. Some inconvenien|cies and hard&s;hips, I mean legal ones, the&s;e latter might indeed be &s;ubjected to; which there is ground to think, a prince of &s;o great equity and goodne&s;s, was &s;o far from being plea&s;ed with, that he would have been
<PB N="34" REF="008925_0031_103033D7258F8250">glad to &s;ee them wholly removed. Happy had it been for the Briti&s;h nations, if all his predece&s;&s;ors in the throne had been of &s;uch generous and catholic prin|ciples&mdash;The true church of Chri&s;t needs not to have her faith <HI>defended</HI> by any other weapons, than tho&s;e of &s;ober rea&s;on and argument, unle&s;s it be again&s;t tho&s;e who attack it with carnal ones. Indeed wicked men and hypocrites can hardly ever think <HI>their</HI> church &s;e|cure, unle&s;s &s;ome other &s;word be&s;ides that of the &s;pi|rit, is drawn in her defence. Tho' &s;he have kings for her nur&s;ing-fathers, and queens for her nur&s;ing-mothers; tho' &s;he be rocked in a princely cradle, and &s;weetly charm'd to her <HI>repo&s;e</HI> with royal lullabies; yet &s;o perver&s;e are &s;ome of her children, that they can take no re&s;t, unle&s;s others, out of her pale, are put upon the rack, or otherwi&s;e harra&s;&s;ed with penal laws&mdash;But, ble&s;&s;ed be God, all our royal defenders of the faith, &s;ince James II, have been content to be nur&s;ing-fathers to the church, by pre&s;erving the pub|lic peace, toleration, and liberty of con&s;cience: The happy effects whereof have been very apparent in ma|ny re&s;pects. And con&s;idering the known ju&s;tice and moderation of the royal hou&s;e of Hanover, and al&s;o of other eminent and di&s;tingui&s;hed per&s;onages in church and &s;tate, we need not wholly de&s;pair of &s;eeing the time, when all good prote&s;tants, and loyal &s;ubjects, &s;hall have their &s;hare in the honors and emoluments of the &s;tate, without being &s;ubjected to any narrow-&s;pi|rited, and injurious <HI>te&s;ts.</HI></P>
<P>BUT not to digre&s;s. It may be &s;aid upon the whole, that the maxims of his late maje&s;ty's government were wi&s;e, noble and truly heroic. And as his views were in general pure, generous and &s;ublime; &s;o it plea&s;ed God to give him a pro&s;perous reign. During his reign, there have indeed been &s;ome dome&s;tic troubles, as
<PB N="35" REF="008925_0032_103033D996645878">well as foreign wars; to prevent which, is not always in the power of the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t kings. Nor can it be denied without blindne&s;s, or extreme prejudice, that &s;ome great and threatning evils, have been grow|ing in the nation ever &s;ince the revolution. Of which, however, tho&s;e only ought to bear the blame, who were the criminal cau&s;es of them. And even not|with&s;tanding the&s;e evils, it may be truly &s;aid, that all the&s;e reigns have been happy, attended with national pro&s;perity and glory; particularly that of his late maje&s;ty. He ever exerted him&s;elf wi&s;ely and vigo|rou&s;ly, and, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, &s;ucce&s;sfully, to promote the public good. The rebellion had a &s;ea|&s;onable &s;top put to it; and the prudent mea&s;ures &s;ince u&s;ed, have in &s;ome mea&s;ure allayed old animo&s;ities, and united parties. There has not, perhaps, been greater harmony in the nation &s;ince the days of queen Elizabeth, if then, than during &s;ome of the la&s;t years of his maje&s;ty's reign. During which time, his ma|je&s;ty's coun&s;els and arms have al&s;o been remarkably pro&s;pered, not only for the defence of his own domi|nions, but al&s;o for reducing the pride and power of France. Neither of the four quarters of the world is de&s;titute of glorious proofs hereof. Nor is it ea&s;y to mention any period, wherein the national honor and pro&s;perity were greater, than at the time of his maje&s;ty's decea&s;e: Even tho' he left his &s;ubjects en|gaged in a war, which we could have wi&s;hed him to terminate with a glory and &s;ucce&s;s, equal to that with which it had been carried on for &s;ome years before. This would have compleated both his and our worldly felicity; and might have rendered the reign of king George II. the mo&s;t glorious period in the Briti&s;h annals: Yea, it may, perhaps, &s;till be &s;o, notwith|&s;tanding this circum&s;tance is wanting to compleat the felicity of it.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="008925_0033_103033DB68C83F20">GOD, indeed, ble&s;&s;ed his maje&s;ty with a long life and reign, tho' not &s;o long as his good &s;ubjects de&s;ired. He was, I &s;uppo&s;e, the olde&s;t reigning prince in Eu|rope, at the time of his decea&s;e: And, for many ages pa&s;t, no king of England had attained to his years <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">He was almo&s;t 77.</NOTE>. Had God regarded the fond wi&s;hes of his loyal &s;ubjects, he might indeed have been immortal: For the time would probably never have come, when they would have parted with him without any reluctance. But the mo&s;t High, who ruleth in the kingdom of men, hath &s;een meet to call him out of this world. And altho' we cannot re&s;ign &s;o good a king, our common father, without a degree of &s;orrow; yet we have doubtle&s;s far more rea&s;on to ble&s;s God for &s;paring him to us &s;o long, than we have to murmur or complain at his taking him away from us at la&s;t. And while we ex|pre&s;s &s;uch an ingenuous grief as becomes dutiful and obliged &s;ubjects on this occa&s;ion, there are, as was intimated before, many circum&s;tances to con&s;ole us under the lo&s;s, and make us acquie&s;ce in this di&s;pen&s;ation of divine providence.</P>
<P>IT may truly be &s;aid of his late maje&s;ty, as it was of king David, that he "died in a good old age, full of days, riches and honor"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Chron. XXIX. 28.</NOTE>. He died as it were in the arms of victory; triumphing over his enemies, foreign and dome&s;tic; over the former by his arms, and over the latter by his goodne&s;s and clemency. He left the nation in as pro&s;perous circum&s;tances, as could well be imagined in a time of war. He had not only lived longer, but done more good, and therefore acquired more glory, than mo&s;t kings, even good ones, had done before him. Nor, which is a mo&s;t material circum&s;tance, did he die till he &s;aw his royal grand&s;on and heir, trained up under his own
<PB N="37" REF="008925_0034_103033DE7347A7B0">eye, and that of a prince&s;s of very di&s;tingui&s;h'd merit, arrived at &s;uch a maturity of life and judgment, as qualified him for taking the government immediately into his own hands.</P>
<P>HOW much better has God been to us in this re|&s;pect, than our fears &s;ometime &s;ince? not to &s;ay, than our de&s;erts, which it were unnece&s;&s;ary to add. It is now almo&s;t ten years &s;ince God, in his holy providence, put us into tears and mourning, and a|wakened our &s;erious apprehen&s;ions, by the untimely death of his royal highne&s;s Frederic, prince of Wales, the then heir apparent, and father to his pre&s;ent ma|je&s;ty. The late king was even then old and gray-headed, and was al&s;o &s;aid at that time to be infirm. The next heir to the throne, he who, by the grace of God, now &s;its upon it, was but about twelve years of age. So that we had great rea&s;on to fear, one of the woes would befal us, which Solomon &s;peaks of; that of having a child, or &s;carce more than a child, to reign over us. His late maje&s;ty, in his great wi&s;|dom and goodne&s;s, took all po&s;&s;ible care and pains to guard again&s;t the inconveniences and hazards of this, if it &s;hould plea&s;e God to take him away during the minority, and tender age, of his royal grand&s;on. But, to our great joy, it has plea&s;ed the mo&s;t High to lengthen out his important life, till he beheld the heir of his kingdoms and dominions of full age, and indeed more than full age, to govern them: And it is &s;ome time &s;ince our ju&s;t apprehen&s;ions above mentioned, were laid a&s;ide. Thus graci|ou&s;ly hath he, who ruleth in the kingdom of men, provided for our welfare. And as his pre|&s;ent maje&s;ty is the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> king of Great-Britain, born therein, i. e. the fir&s;t born in the i&s;land of Britain, &s;ince the kingdoms of England and Scotland were united, God grant he may prove a great and equal

In &s;aying which, I tru&s;t, I &s;ay nothing unbecoming a good &s;ubject, in contra|di&s;tinction to a &s;lave.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to the late&s;t advices from Britain, which came to town the la&s;t evening, it &s;eems that a very &s;peedy peace is not now much expected, at lea&s;t, that it is not to be depended upon. We have indeed his maje&s;ty's declaration to the court on the day of the late king's death, wherein, I think, this is im|plied: A declaration conceived in &s;uch terms, as tend to rai&s;e our expectations of great felicity under his reign. You will doubtle&s;s hear with plea&s;ure part of a &s;entence or two, extracted from it, as it has not been made public among&s;t us&mdash;After &s;peaking of the great lo&s;s which he and the nation had &s;u&s;tained in the &s;udden death of the king, his maje&s;ty proceeds thus: <Q>But animated by the tendere&s;t affections for this MY NATIVE COUNTRY, and depending on the advice, the experience and abilities of your lord|&s;hips, on the &s;upport and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of every hone&s;t man, I enter with chearfulne&s;s into this arduous &s;ituation; and &s;hall make it the bu&s;ine&s;s of my life to promote in every thing the glory and in|tere&s;t of the&s;e kingdoms</Q>&mdash; A declaration truly worthy a young Briti&s;h monarch; which we ought to con&s;ider, not as words of cour&s;e, but as proceed|ing

<P>THOUGH we ought always to remember our late &s;overeign with the greate&s;t veneration, our allegiance mu&s;t now be, or rather is already, transferred to his royal grand&s;on and heir; in whom, in &s;ome &s;en&s;e, he &s;till &s;urvives &amp; reigns. The&s;e Northern American colo|nies have indeed ever di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by their loyalty, and their zeal for the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the hou&s;e of Hanover. We had accordingly a great &s;hare in the affections of his late maje&s;ty; the happy fruits of who&s;e royal care, and indefatigable endea|vours for our &s;ecurity and welfare, we now reap in

His royal highne&s;s, the late prince Frederic, had al&s;o a great concern for the pro&s;perity of the colonies, as he well knew both their loyalty, and their importance to Great-Britain. And had he lived to a&s;cend the throne, we &s;hould doubtle&s;s have had in him &s;uch another friend and protector, as we have lo&s;t in his late maje&s;ty. We have no rea&s;on to doubt, but that his pre&s;ent maje&s;ty will have the &s;ame gracious regard for us; and, perhaps, perfect that deliverance &s;o happily begun, and carried on &s;o far, for his American &s;ubjects, within the&s;e few years pa&s;t. May God give us favour in his eyes, as he did in the eyes, both of his royal grand|father and father, that our great lo&s;s in them may be made up in him! This we have rea&s;on humbly to hope, if we per&s;evere in our accu&s;tomed loyalty; and &s;till conduct our&s;elves as dutiful &s;ubjects. And if our late, ever-honoured king, could now &s;peak to us, I am per&s;waded he would admoni&s;h us to &s;hew our regard to his memory, not &s;o much by fruitle&s;ly lament|ing his death, as by a dutiful and loyal behaviour to|wards his &s;ucce&s;&s;or; as the certain way to &s;ecure his royal favour, and, by the ble&s;&s;ing of heaven, to pro|long, or even to increa&s;e, our tranquility and happine&s;s.

<P>IF kings, if great and good kings, &s;uch as the &s;ove|reign of the world has dignified with the title of <HI>godsy</HI> mu&s;t &s;o &s;oon "die like men," certainly we common mortals &s;hould not either flatter our&s;elves with the hope of immortality here, or place our &s;upreme felicity in this world.

Happy [then] is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, who&s;e hope is in the Lord his God, which made heaven and earth, the &s;ea, and all that therein is; which keepeth mercy forever."&mdash;The Lord &s;hall live and reign for|ever: And the obedient &s;ubjects of his kingdom &s;hall be ever &s;ecure, ever happy, in his favour and protec|tion, tho' the kingdoms of this world are moved and overturned, or both earth heaven were di&s;&s;olved!</P>
<P>TO conclude then: Let us all be admoni&s;hed to put our tru&s;t in the great, the eternal God; and, in the way of well-doing, to commit the keeping of our bo|dies and &s;ouls to him, as unto a faithful creator. Let us both fear God, and honor the king; which duties the apo&s;tle joins together. Let us endeavour to lead quiet and peaceable lives in all godline&s;s and hone&s;ty; "as free, and not u&s;ing our liberty for a cloke of maliciou&s;ne&s;s, but as the &s;ervants of God;" and, by patient continuance in well-doing, &s;eek for glory, ho|nor and immortality. Let us be faithful and diligent in di&s;charging the duties of our &s;everal &s;tations in life; knowing that we are &s;oon to pa&s;s off the &s;tage of this world, and to give an account of our&s;elves to God the judge of all. And let me remind you, that in the judgment of the great day, it will be of far le&s;s impor|tance, who has been a king, or mighty monarch, and who a per&s;on of low degree, than it will be, who has
<PB N="43" REF="008925_0040_103033EDB13EBC38">been a truly upright and good, and who a di&s;hone&s;t and wicked man. For when the &s;ea, death and hell [hades] &s;hall deliver up the dead that were in them, and the &s;mall and great &s;hall &s;tand together before God, they &s;hall be <Q>judged every man according to their works.</Q></P>
<P>WHEREFORE now unto him, the king eternal, im|mortal, invi&s;ible, who hath prepared his throne in the heavens, and who&s;e kingdom ruleth over all; unto him be glory for ever and ever, AMEN.</P>
