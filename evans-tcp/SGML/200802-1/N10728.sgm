<HEAD>TO LORD NORTH, PRIME MINISTER OF ENGLAND.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS you are the Atlas of the &s;tate, its religious and moral, as well as civil and commercial concerns are intru&s;ted to your care; and, therefore, this &s;ketch of the times can &s;o properly be addre&s;&s;ed to no one as your&s;elf. Give me leave then to be|gin my addre&s;s to your Lord&s;hip (with only alter|ing one word) in the four well known beautiful lines of Horace, to the Emperor Augu&s;tus,
<Q><L>Cum tot &s;e&s;tineas &amp; tanta negotia, &s;olus,</L>
<L>Res <HI>ANGLAS,</HI> &amp;c.</L></Q></P>
<P>To the Royal Favour, my Lord, you owe what you are. What you &s;hould be, the Guardian of the kingdom's morals as well as her revenues; and what you may be, if you will, the greate&s;t and be&s;t Prime Mini&s;ter from the time of your predece&s;&s;ors Cardinal Wol&s;ey, &amp;c. down to Lord Chatham, is now my bu&s;ine&s;s to point out to you.</P>
<P>AMONG all the plans, then, which have been ever offered to your Lord&s;hip's con&s;ideration, to improve the intere&s;t and welfare of the kingdom, I appeal to all hone&s;t, worthy, and good men, if you ever had one equal to this which I here offer in the following di&s;cour&s;e, as an hint only, and taken from the famous project, propo&s;al, or plan, for the advancement of religion and morality in this kingdom, of a late celebrated
<PB N="iv" REF="013599_0003_0F9142C182EDAA10">
State&s;man, as well as Divine, Now, by putting this excellent plan of his into execution, as &s;oon and as much as you can, you may be what I ju&s;t now &s;aid, the greate&s;t and be&s;t of Prime Mini&s;ters, as their plans are limited only to this world, whereas the plan now before you extends to the next. But, alas! my Lord, I do mo&s;t &s;trangely forget my&s;elf; the next world, did I &s;ay? I retract that expre&s;&s;ion; for why do I mention it in a na|tion that &s;eems, by the daily practices of too many by far of all orders, ranks, and degrees of people, to have bani&s;hed all thoughts of it? You &s;ee then how you may be, if you will, the Hercules to clean&s;e this Augean Stable; and have in your hands, if you will u&s;e it, the &s;word of Alexander to cut this Gordian Knot! But here, I &s;uppo&s;e, my Lord, I &s;hall have the old u&s;ual plea thrown out again&s;t the plan as was done by Lord Oxford and the then Mini&s;try, and afterwards by Sir Ro|bert Walpole, Duke of Newca&s;tle, and &s;o on, that the times and rea&s;ons of &s;tate will not admit of it. If &s;o, I am &s;orry for it, and &s;o mu&s;t every hone&s;t man be in the whole kingdom. However, this will do for the &s;ame rea&s;on, I &s;uppo&s;e, in the body politic as &s;ome phy&s;icians urge the nerves and bile in the body natural; and, indeed, the fir&s;t has re|&s;embled the la&s;t by much too long. An ulcer has overrun it from head to foot, (the King and Queen, God pre&s;erve them! excepted) and unle&s;s &s;ome &s;trictly hone&s;t &s;tate &s;urgeon ari&s;es, for as to &s;kill there wants none, and will, with the intrepidity of the Eagle's eye, and the boldne&s;s of the Lion's heart, take the knife in one hand, and cau&s;tic in the other, and cut and burn all before him, till he has probed the wound quite to the bottom, (for, other|wi&s;e it is only &s;kinning it over) there may be a mo&s;t violent &s;hock, if not in end, to the con&s;titu|tion. Our recovery is not only extremely hazar|dous

but al&s;o, humanly &s;peaking, almo&s;t impo&s;&s;i|ble; and therefore, my Lord, unle&s;s a general and &s;peedy reformation of the religion and morals of this kingdom takes place by the divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, what England may be in the beginning of the next century, if not before, every one who is a real friend to his King and country mu&s;t dread to think!
<Q>Hinc illae lachrymae!</Q>
For whatever others may pretend to &s;ay, it is the firm per&s;ua&s;ion of my&s;elf, and all good men, <Q>that there is not only a general Providence over na|tions, but al&s;o a particular one over individuals,</Q> notwith&s;tanding what a late learned compiler of &s;ome voyages has &s;ugge&s;ted to the contrary.</P>
<P>I have been urged, my Lord, to addre&s;s the following di&s;cour&s;e to you from no worldly motives what&s;oever; but entirely from a mo&s;t &s;incere and hearty zeal for my King and country, your Lord|&s;hip's honor in this world, and your happine&s;s in the next; and yet, don't think that I mean to flatter you. If I am guilty of flattery at all, (as people &s;ay) it is to the King, not to your&s;elf; but if &s;o, it is for a very good rea&s;on, becau&s;e (Heavens ble&s;s him) he has nothing in his power to give. You, my Lord, who have every thing in church as well as &s;tate, I would &s;corn to flatter; the very thought it&s;elf I dete&s;t and abhor; and yet, I hope I have not &s;hewn my&s;elf, either here or in my &s;ermon, to have been an entire &s;tranger at the altar of the graces. This dedication, therefore, is not by way of in|cen&s;e at the &s;hrine of your Lord&s;hip's power; for though I am le&s;s than the lea&s;t of all curates, city or country, and have been in orders now almo&s;t thirty years, without preferment, or ever the lea&s;t expectation of it, yet give me leave to tell you, my Lord, one thing, as a matter of fact: <Q>That it is not two years ago when I was offered &s;ome
<PB N="vi" REF="013599_0005_0F9142C3327311D0">
of the fir&s;t and be&s;t pieces of preferment in the church, by a certain gentleman near one of the &s;quares, in great connections with men in pow|er; but were offered in &s;uch a manner as no hone&s;t man would dare to accept; and therefore, though I had the honor of having them offered to me, yet (thank God) I had the grace to refu&s;e them.</Q> No, my Lord, let me ever be without preferment with a good con&s;cience, infinitely before being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Canterbury it&s;elf with a pro&s;ti|tuted one! I have neither the plea&s;ure nor honor of being known to you, but am no &s;tranger to a certain gentleman<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mr.</HI> GRAY COOPER, <HI>Secretary to the Board.</HI></NOTE> in your Lord&s;hip's department of the Trea&s;ury, with whom I was, about twenty-three years ago, &s;even years at Trinity College in Cam|bridge. A few words more, my Lord, and then I will relieve your patience: Upon the brightne&s;s of your character in private life, as an hu&s;band, father, ma&s;ter, &amp;c. your very enemies will not at|tempt, I believe, to ca&s;t even one injurious or in|vidious &s;hade; &s;o far, my Lord, I honor you. In public life, as a Prime Mini&s;ter, Politician, Financier, &amp;c. as your Lord&s;hip's candor will ex|cu&s;e my &s;ilence on the&s;e points, &s;o I leave them to be decided by tho&s;e who are be&s;t able to determine them. You are now arrived, and early in life too, at the very acme (as the Greeks call it) of greatne&s;s; and &s;o we may well conclude, that you are the primum mobile of this great machine, the &s;tate. But forgive me, my Lord, for once, if I err in a&s;king a que&s;tion or two, and offering an hint: Is there not ore in particular, and two or three others as from him, who oil all tho&s;e &s;prings which you only &s;eem to move, and accelerate or retard the wheels of &s;tate as may be&s;t &s;uit his or their projects? If not, how &s;hall we account for all

tho&s;e evils di&s;tre&s;&s;es, grievances, and oppre&s;&s;ions, which have befallen this poor unfortunate king|dom, not long after the year 1760? When no Prince upon earth ever came to a throne (and mo&s;t de&s;ervedly &s;o) with a more meridian &s;plendor, the hearts and &s;ouls of all his &s;ubjects. But oh! my Lord, we can't &s;ufficiently lament that this fair and goodly cedar tree, the pride and glory of the national fore&s;t, under who&s;e &s;hade we thought to have long and happily re&s;ted, &s;hould &s;o &s;oon have been n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">pt and chilled in the love and affection of his &s;ubjects, by this rough and inclement northern bla&s;t. You &s;erve, my Lord, one of the be&s;t and mo&s;t worthy ma&s;ters in the world, who &s;till lives in the hearts and affections of his people; and therefore they can the more ea&s;ily and tenderly overlook his predilection occa&s;ioned by prejudice of education. In gratitude to him, therefore, and in honor to your&s;elf, do you neither mi&s;lead him, nor (if in your power) &s;uffer him to be mi&s;led. You are too well ver&s;ed in hi&s;tory and mankind, my Lord, to be told, that favoriti&s;m will never do in any kingdom long, but in England e&s;pecially. Remember Sejanus, and forget not Mortimer and Buckingham. Emancipate then your royal ma&s;ter and your&s;elf from the fetters of him in which you have been too long detained, and confine him and his Junto to a gentle bani&s;hment in his own i&s;land. Hence England may, perhaps &s;ee her halcyon days once more; and &s;o you would be the better enabled to execute this plan to your own immortal honor, and the welfare and happine&s;s of our King and country. In the mean time, my Lord, give me leave however, to indulge my&s;elf in the plea&s;ing thoughts of &s;eeing the kingdom &s;omewhat reform|ed by your Lord&s;hip (under God!) as to its religi|on, morality, and virtue, in joining with the late learned and excellent Lord Ro&s;common in part of

<HEAD>AN ADDRESS TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE author of the following di&s;cour&s;e having too much rea&s;on to think that it has been &s;trangely repre&s;ented, by &s;ome who have heard it from the pul|pit, to his brethren the clergy, whom he would not willingly offend, has now brought it to the bar of the public, to plead its own cau&s;e, and where it mu&s;t be ab&s;olved or condemned by the verdict of their ju&s;t and impartial determination. He only begs leave to defend him&s;elf thus far, by a&s;&s;uring the reader, very faithfully, that neither his preaching nor pub|li&s;hing it was by any means the re&s;ult of a conceited &s;ingularity, as a clergyman, nor of a low paltry pride, or vanity of being an author! but entirely to an hone&s;t and hearty endeavour, as his la&s;t effort, to rou&s;e the attention of the mini&s;try to &s;omething el&s;e be&s;ides them&s;elves, in order to revive the expiring cau&s;e of the religion and morals of his country!&mdash;The &s;u&s;picions of his brethren ari&s;ing from the above mi&s;repre&s;entation of it, he takes to have been the chief, if not only, rea&s;on of his having been refu&s;ed the pulpit at &s;o many capital churches. His regard and tenderne&s;s, therefore, for them, as well tho&s;e who refu&s;ed as tho&s;e who granted it, will, he doubts not, be a &s;ufficient apology with the reader for his concealing the churches. As to the re&s;pectable and worthy part of that venerable body of men, he very highly honors them, and ever &s;hall; and as to the Ma|caroni and Je&s;&s;amy &s;prings of divinity, with their curled pates fro&s;ted o'er like a Twelfth Cake, to be &s;ure he honors them too, as the very worthy &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors of &s;o much apo&s;tolical gravity and dignity! He is well aware of what cen&s;ures he &s;hall incur

by this &s;ermon and dedication, from many of the venal part of the laity, as well as &s;ome perhaps, of the clergy; but this, with many other things, give him not the lea&s;t concern, for (thank God!) he has neither hopes nor fears from any man living what&s;oever.</HI></P>
<P><HI>What his principles are, religious or political, or whether he has any principles at all, he &s;uppo&s;es to be of very little or no concern to the public from &s;uch a very ob&s;cure and in&s;ignificant a per&s;on as him&s;elf. He, therefore, wants not to make the lea&s;t boa&s;t or parade of either his orthodoxy in the church, or his patrioti&s;m in the &s;tate; but hopes that the candour of the public will allow him to &s;ay thus much of both, that, &s;eparate from his profe&s;|&s;ion, he looks upon the church of England to be the mo&s;t truly primitive and apo&s;tolical, and there|fore the be&s;t con&s;tituted church this day upon the face of the whole earth; and in which, however unworthy a member be may have lived, he &s;hall al&s;o die. And as to e&s;tate, what little he has, together with his life, are and &s;hall be ready to be laid at the feet of his king and country. Let ancient or modern patrioti&s;m &s;ay or do more. The clergy, he knows, are reckoned, and reviled by too many of their enemies as only dumb dogs, in the prophet's expre&s;&s;ion. As to his own part, they may call him a &s;urly, &s;narling, or what dog they plea&s;e, if they will but allow him to be an hone&s;t dog, as he means not to bite, or even bark, any farther than to be a watchful one, as every hone&s;t dog ought to be, and to give the alarm again&s;t evil or negligent mini&s;ters either in church or &s;tate. He finds that he is accu&s;ed of ill will and envy again&s;t a certain nation, both in his dedication and &s;ermon but he begs leave to a&s;&s;ure them that it is very unju&s;tly, as he bears a general love and good will to all mankind. He only wi&s;hes that their

great patron would not add to the number of mo|nopoli&s;ts in this kingdom, as God knows, and the nation feels it fatally enough, that we have by far too many already; and that his own countrymen might be &s;uffered now and then to go &s;nacks with them in the di&s;po&s;al of pen&s;ions and places both at home and abroad. If he has been in the lea&s;t in&s;trumental by this &s;ermon, or dedication, even to give an hint either to men in or out of power, to execute this plan for reforming the kingdom's religion and mo|rals, as the nece&s;&s;ity of it is daily &s;een and felt, be their's the prai&s;e, and his the only reward, as he looks for no other. As he has had the honor of being frequently mi&s;taken for a certain name&s;ake of his, the &s;uppo&s;ed author and vender of political drugs under the &s;ignitures of Anti-Sejanus, Old Slyboots, &amp;c. &s;o he &s;hould be upon the ten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">er-books of pain and vexation to hear that any illi|beral reflections, or har&s;h and cruel cen&s;ures, &s;hould at any time fall upon him to affect his ea&s;e and tranquility by day, or his &s;oft &s;lumbers and &s;weet repo&s;e by night; he therefore thinks it his duty to inform the public, that this very worthy and re&s;pectable gentleman has not the lea&s;t hand, or is any ways concerned what&s;oever in this dedication, addre&s;s, or &s;ermon, and hopes that this caution will prevent any &s;tain from falling upon that im|maculate character, the &s;uppo&s;ed pupil, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ron<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y, and friend of that Scipio and Alexander of a man for continence and cha&s;tity,</HI> the pious and virtuous Lord Sandwich. <HI>No man in his &s;en&s;es would willingly incur the ill opinion and di&s;like of the worthy and valuable part of mankind, and thereby create enemies to him&s;elf; but to &s;ee an hone&s;t, well-meaning Prince deceived, mi&s;led, and abu&s;ed, and one's country expo&s;ed, injured, and in&s;ulted, by a cabal or junto of men, who are only moder|nizing ancient Patrioti&s;m &s;o far as to be laughing

<BIBL>ECCLESIASTES, ch. vii. ver. 10.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>Say not thou, What is</HI> the cau&s;e <HI>that former days were better than the&s;e? For thou do&s;t not inquire wi&s;ely concerning this.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>SINCE human nature and conduct have been much the &s;ame in all ages of the world, it will be of no great &s;ervice to us to inquire of an|tiquity, whether former times have been better or wor&s;e than the pre&s;ent? And for any one to pre|tend to &s;ay that other nations, now living, are better or wor&s;e than our&s;elves, is &s;aying much more than he can prove; and granting even that he could prove that they are much wor&s;e than we are, yet this is no ju&s;tification to us now as a na|tion, nor will it be &s;o to us hereafter, as individu|als, at the la&s;t and great day of accounts! But however, I am very certain of this, that it is high time for us to be much better than we are, both as a nation and as individuals.</P>
<P>Whoever, then, has a true regard for the honor and welfare of church and &s;tate, which are &s;o hap|pily e&s;tabli&s;hed by the ancient laws of this king|dom, as to make us the pride of our own, and the admiration and envy of all other nations, and &s;o nicely compacted with each other, that, like a
<PB N="14" REF="013599_0013_0F9142CF217527B0">
building mo&s;t curiou&s;ly framed, they mu&s;t &s;tand or fall together; and if he has but a tolerable &s;hare of hi&s;tory, and will &s;it down with a &s;erious concern to con&s;ider the pre&s;ent &s;tate of this nation, as to its religion, morals, and virtues, mu&s;t lament to &s;ee how exactly it re&s;embles the Grecian and Roman empires, when they were drawing towards the point of their di&s;&s;olution! That general deluge of luxury and pride, profligacy of morals, an open and avowed contempt of the Deity, infidelity, bribery, and corruption, which overflowed them ju&s;t before their ruin, is but too glaring a picture of this na|tion; and, therefore, too &s;ad and di&s;agreeable to the eye of every true Briton to behold with the lea&s;t &s;atisfaction!</P>
<P>As to religion, and the &s;acred writings, we are come to that pa&s;s now, that you may bla&s;pheme your God, revile your king, think what you plea&s;e, and &s;peak what you think, and no one take any notice of it! But in all other re&s;pects, as to mora|lity, virtue, true patrioti&s;m, and common hone&s;ty, we feel every day the di&s;mal effects of an iron age, while we in vain wi&s;h for the return of a golden one!</P>
<P>As this little i&s;land of ours is &s;eparated from the continent, it &s;eems by its peculiar happy &s;ituation, to have been originally de&s;igned by Providence to make its inhabitants completely happy within them&s;elves, were they but &s;en&s;ible of their happi|ne&s;s, and knew how to value it aright! But God, in his ju&s;t judgments, is plea&s;ed to let a cur&s;e go forth upon &s;ome nations, for being &s;o wilfully blind as that they will not &s;ee their own happine&s;s, and pur&s;ue them till they are ripe for an entire de&s;tructi|on! How far this may be our ca&s;e, (and much &s;ooner perhaps than we imagine) God him&s;elf only knows, if it is not timely prevented by a national repentance and reformation! Oh, England, how
<PB N="15" REF="013599_0014_0F9142D0D31B8290">
art thou fallen! and how &s;hamefully and ba&s;ely corrupted are thy &s;ons and daughters from their primitive piety, virtue, and integrity!</P>
<P>We are daily talking that we wi&s;h to &s;ee better times (and it is our own fault if we do not) but as we &s;eem to be going on, that is never likely till the final re&s;titution of all things, at the end of the world!</P>
<P>That the pre&s;ent times are extremely bad is too well known, and too &s;adly and fatally felt by all in general; and, therefore, no wonder to hear &s;uch daily complaints that they are &s;o; but this is whol|ly owing to our&s;elves! Hence it is not &s;o very difficult, as &s;ome people may pretend, to find out, a way both to remedy the complaints of the times, and to remove the cau&s;e of them.</P>
<P>Now, in order to do this the better, I &s;hall &s;trike at the very root of all our evils, di&s;tre&s;&s;es, griev|ances, and oppre&s;&s;ions, at once, by &s;aying, that there is but very little or no religion left among us; by which I mean, a fear of God, and a belief of a future &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;hments. Our great are, too many of them, above all religi|on; and our little people are as much below it. What &s;mall remains of it are &s;till left among us, are to be found only, or however chiefly among our middle &s;ort of people; and even there, I fear, it is too much and &s;adly corrupted! Now, if a kingdom has &s;uch very little notion of living in the fear of God, can it po&s;&s;ibly be any wonder that they live in no &s;ort of fear of man? But by far too many going daily on in tho&s;e iniquitous and infernal practices, which &s;eem right in their own eyes, as though there was no judge in I&s;rael.</P>
<P>As to our nobility and gentry, they have two examples before them, who, as they are the greate&s;t, &s;o are the be&s;t in all conjugal, parental, dome&s;tic, and &s;ocial virtues; in&s;omuch that they are both the

Was I to con&s;ider this &s;ubject of the times parti|cularly, you might well think me tedious indeed; but though it is &s;o great and extraordinary, I &s;hall endeavor to be as full, and yet as &s;hort as po&s;&s;ible, and therefore beg your patience.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now then &s;tate the ca&s;e of this nation very fairly and hone&s;tly with you, by &s;hewing that the grounds and cau&s;es of all our complaints of the times will be found to ari&s;e entirely from our&s;elves, <HI>i. e.</HI> from a want of religion among us throughout the whole kingdom in general, and its capital city in particular; which, like all other capitals, in morals as well as trade, arts, and ma|nufactures, hath great influence upon the re&s;t of their re&s;pective kingdoms.</P>
<P>I &s;hall in the fir&s;t place, therefore, hint only at things in general; by way of que&s;tion; and, in the &s;econd and la&s;t place, point out a method, which, if quickly and carefully practi&s;ed, would (under God) mo&s;t effectually reform the nation, and re&s;tore it to its ancient &s;tate of religion, morality and virtue.</P>
<P>To begin then with our nobility and gentry, for according to their examples, good or bad, the middle and lower &s;ort of people are ob&s;erved to form their lives and conver&s;ations; I have already ju&s;t mentioned, that they have two excellent examples at court before their eyes, in all conjugal, parental dome&s;tic, and &s;ocial virtues; and yet don't mi&s;take me, and think that I am putting on the courtier here, in &s;peaking this by way of flattery only; I dete&s;t even the thought of &s;uch low, mean, unmanly, paltry, pitiful behaviour; I appeal to your&s;elves for the truth, and e&s;pecially to tho&s;e who are daily about their per&s;ons. I would therefore, only a&s;k, Do they imitate them (in general I mean) in the&s;e amiable virtues and qualities? If &s;o, pray now how comes it to pa&s;s that divorces, &s;eparations!

<P>Again, do tho&s;e &s;hew them&s;elves true friends to their King and country by complimenting their Maje&s;ties on their birth days, at court, in dre&s;&s;es of French, or other foreign manufactury?

Is there no perjury committed by tho&s;e of the clergy, who purcha&s;e livings for them&s;elves with their own money, either directly or indirectly?

<P>Again, is it likely for the morality and virtue of a kingdom to la&s;t long, when &s;uch a multitude of places of diver&s;ion, and di&s;&s;ipation of people's time and money, are &s;uffered by tho&s;e at the helm of affairs (who ought to be the guardians of the king|dom's morals as well as her revenues) to enervate bodies and unhinge the minds, not only of the ca|pital city in particular, but al&s;o the whole kingdom in general, and that even in the &s;olemn time and &s;ea&s;on of Lent too!

Is the pre&s;ent mode of education at our academies, large &s;chools, and others throughout the kingdom, and at our two univer&s;ities, for the ri&s;ing generation of the men, and our French and other boarding &s;chools, in and about this great city in particular, and the nation in general, for the ri&s;ing generation of the women, &s;o happily calculated and formed for improving the morals as well as the learning of children now a days? If &s;o, how comes it to pa&s;s, that we hear &s;uch frequent and daily complaints from fathers, mothers, and guardians, that they &s;carce know where to put the one part of the &s;ex, to &s;ecure their morals, as well as improve them in learning; and the other part, that they learn nothing but pride, folly, and extravagance in dre&s;s, and of every other kind what&s;oever? Is it either for the intere&s;t or honor of a nation, for its nobility and gentry to be drawing every year &s;uch immen&s;e &s;ums of money out of it, and lavi&s;hing it away abroad on their vices and follies, under the notion of travelling into foreign parts, and &s;eeing the world; where, from the ignorance of their own nation, through the rawne&s;s and inexperience of their youth (ju&s;t, as it were, thrown out of their mother's lap, and fal&s;e notions imbibed in it) they are &s;ure to glean up every weed of vice and folly which falls in their way!

And now, even from the&s;e two or three que&s;tions, does it not too plainly appear (and well for us if not too fat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lly felt a few years hence!) that our French, and other foreign fa&s;hions, have done us infinitely more mi&s;chief towards our ruin than all their wars with us (thank God! have been ever able to do?

<P>To be drawing now towards a conclu&s;ion with the &s;econd and la&s;t part of it, which is to &s;hew you particularly that the grounds and cau&s;es of all the evils in this nation, and our complaints of the times, will be found to ari&s;e entirely from our&s;elves, <HI>i. e.</HI> from a want of a due &s;en&s;e of religion among us, through the whole kingdom in general, and its ca|pital city in particular. For religion (however it may be derided and reproached in this nice, &s;quea|mi&s;h, and delicate age) was always thought by the wi&s;er and more &s;ober heathens to be a mo&s;t la&s;ting foundation of laws and &s;ocieties, as without it no government can &s;ub&s;i&s;t, nor ju&s;tice be admini&s;tered. Thus Plato calls religion "the barrier of power and ju&s;tice, and a tye of hone&s;ty," and Tully &s;ays of the Romans, "that they conquered &s;o many nations not &s;o much by &s;tratagem, or &s;uperior &s;trength, as by their &s;trict regard and &s;acred reve|rence for religion and virtue." And therefore had

I &s;hall, therefore, point out to you &s;uch an ob&s;ervation or two of his from it as will be mo&s;t &s;erviceable towards filling up this &s;ketch of the times, which I have here given, leav|ing it to a far more able pencil to complete the piece.</P>
<P>"As the power (&s;ays he) of giving away all employments in church and &s;tate is in the crown, either by the King him&s;elf, or by his mini&s;ters, it is in the power of every prince to make religion and virtue become the fa&s;hion of the age, provided they are made to be, at the &s;ame time, the direct and nece&s;&s;ary &s;teps to favor and preferment. If princes, therefore, de&s;ire to &s;ee their people happy and pro&s;|perous, let them make it every man's intere&s;t and honor to be religious and virtuous, by making irre|ligion and vice a di&s;grace, and a &s;ure bar to their promotion in either; this they &s;hould fir&s;t endeavor to do in their own courts and families; and then religion and virtue would &s;oon become fa&s;hionable graces at court, and would be carefully practi&s;ed as the only methods to get and keep employments there, which alone would have great influence on the nobility and gentry; for if religion and virtue were once under&s;tood to be the nece&s;&s;ary and direct &s;teps to favor and preferment, then no one would openly offend again&s;t them, who had the lea&s;t re|gard for their reputation and fortune."</P>
<P>Now to this fir&s;t part of the plan, I may ju&s;tly add my former remark, that they have two as ami|able examples before their eyes, as any court in Europe, or the whole world can produce! Whether a method to re&s;tore this nation to its real greatne&s;s

and glory, <HI>i. e.</HI> its religion and virtue, agreeable or no, I know not, nor does it concern me; otherwi&s;e, I mean, than mo&s;t heartily wi&s;hing it was put in practice; and that it is practicable will be readily confe&s;&s;ed by every one who are their King and country's real friends! There is only wanting an hearty de&s;ire and &s;teady re&s;olution for all parties to unite in &s;o good and nece&s;&s;ary a work; for, alas! what can half a &s;core or an hundred do, if all don't join? And (as the plan ob&s;erves again) that &s;ome effectual attempt &s;hould be made towards &s;uch a reformation, is more nece&s;&s;ary than people may imagine, as the ruin of a nation is &s;ure to follow a general corruption of morals, and contempt of reli|gion, which &s;eems to be too much our ca&s;e at pre&s;ent! For when men, in places of great tru&s;t and power in a nation, do their duty for con&s;cience &s;ake, affairs will not &s;uffer then by fraud or neglect; and if they believed a divine Providence and a future &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;hments, and acted accordingly, what an happy change of affairs we &s;hould then have throughout the kingdom, by &s;uch &s;trong and powerful examples!</P>
<P>His pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty (who&s;e life may God long pre&s;erve, it being mo&s;t particularly dear and valu|able to us in the&s;e critical and hazardous times) is a prince well known to have many great and good qualities, among which integrity and truth, an heart truly hone&s;t and prote&s;tant, a &s;tranger to hypocri&s;y, and dete&s;ting di&s;&s;imulation and flattery; and therefore, was I now preaching before him, he mu&s;t give me leave to tell him al&s;o, according to the plan &s;omewhat varied, that his be&s;t endeavors to in&s;til &s;ome &s;hare of tho&s;e virtues, of which him&s;elf and his mo&s;t amiable con&s;ort are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, into his people, are a mo&s;t important part of his duty, as well as his intere&s;t and honor.</P>

To conclude, let us con&s;ider and well remember, that the once famed Grecian and Roman empires were entirely overturned and de&s;troyed by their conque&s;ts in Per&s;ia, A&s;ia, Africa, and Judea, letting in upon them &s;uch a deluge of luxury, profanene&s;s and immorality! How far the Briti&s;h Empire has been already affected (and may be &s;till more &s;o) as to its religion and morals, by that immen&s;e flow of wealth and luxury from our conque&s;ts in the Ea&s;t-Indies; and how far tho&s;e who have brought it over, acquired there in &s;o very few years, can reconcile to their own con&s;ciences the manner in which they got it; and the luxury and corruption, and con&s;e|quently the decline of religion and virtue in this kingdom, I leave to them&s;elves to con&s;ider. But mo&s;t &s;ure I am of this one thing, that in any king|dom, either abroad or at home, when the man once &s;uffers him&s;elf to be en&s;laved to ambition and extor|tion, or to luxury and plea&s;ure, the Chri&s;tian is not very likely to &s;tay long behind! There mu&s;t be then, you &s;ee plainly, one grand re&s;toration to the principles of religion and virtue, in educating the ri&s;ing generation of the rich, middle, and lower &s;ort of people in this kingdom; otherwi&s;e all the preach|ing of the clergy till doom&s;day, and all the pretences to patrioti&s;m and public &s;pirit, are, and will be, do|ing nothing at all; as he, that would have his garden fruitful in autumn, mu&s;t take care to dig, weed, and plant it well in the &s;pring; accordingly Solomon finely and ju&s;tly ob&s;erves to us, "Train up a child, &s;ays he (but how: Not in the way he is going, for then t&egrave;n thou&s;and to one but he is ruined! No, but) in the way that he &s;hould go, for when he is old he will not depart from it!" Let all parents and guardians then make it their chief care and concern to plant in their children's hearts the early &s;eeds of religion and virtue! Let them teach them, almo&s;t from their very cradle, and repeating to them as
<PB N="29" REF="013599_0028_0F9142E0411F5A80">
they grow up, &s;uch as to think and &s;peak awfully of the MOST HIGH GOD, reverently of religion, and re&s;pectfully of its mini&s;ters, honor and obedience to parents, duty to their King and country, &s;obriety and temperance to them&s;elves, ju&s;tice and hone&s;ty to others, and a general love and good will to all their fellow creatures.</P>
<P>One great error prevailing in this kingdom, and its capital city in particular, is that we have here too much preaching, and too little catechizing children, at church by the clergy, and at home by their parents! Now the want of this is the fountain head of all our evils and di&s;tre&s;&s;es, as this would be laying the true and only foundation of religion and virtue in their young and tender minds, by in&s;truct|ing and keeping them to the very fir&s;t principles of it. Had we, therefore, le&s;s preaching and more catechi&s;ing, I am mo&s;t certain we &s;hould have a much deeper, and con&s;equently a much better &s;en&s;e of religion, which would influence our whole lives and conver&s;ations, for to preach to people without their knowing the principles of their religion, is like building an hou&s;e without fir&s;t laying a foundation. It is this want of catechi&s;ing, or in&s;tructing youth in the&s;e principles, that has been the true and only cau&s;e of all tho&s;e various &s;ects and opinions, which have &s;o di&s;turbed the private peace and happine&s;s of families, as well as the public, and almo&s;t de|&s;troyed what little religion there is now left in the nation! For the minds of too many people now are &s;o blown up with noi&s;e, non&s;en&s;e, wild and empty notions, that among tho&s;e of forty or fifty years old, you will &s;carce find any able to give that account of their faith, as Chri&s;tians, which formerly you might have heard from a boy of ten or twelve; and therefore what the pulpit has neglected, and con&s;e|quently di&s;ordered and de&s;troyed, the de&s;k mu&s;t re|&s;tore. Had this been done at the beginning of the
<PB N="30" REF="013599_0029_0F9142E12F9F8B28">
pre&s;ent century, and con&s;equently kept up, not only in the time of Lent, but al&s;o all the year round, we &s;hould have had no room for complaints, that for|mer times were better than the pre&s;ent. We live now, at this day, in the very be&s;t times of the world! and mo&s;t &s;orry I am to &s;ay it, in the very wor&s;t times al&s;o! Be&s;t from God, and wor&s;t from our&s;elves! And therefore, after all, if private peo|ple will, by a fooli&s;h and amazing extravagance, plunge them&s;elves headlong into debt, and then rail and cry out at the badne&s;s of the times, becau&s;e they are arre&s;ted; and if the public money, in&s;tead of being &s;kilfully and hone&s;tly applied (as it ought to be) to the public &s;ervice, is embezzled and &s;quandered away, for &s;ecret &s;ervices, and other ba&s;e, mean, and &s;candalous purpo&s;es, and no enquiries ever made, or &s;uffered to be made, what is become of it, or how is it applied? and if an hone&s;t, faith|ful, and loyal body of citizens petition and remon|&s;trate to their &s;overeign (the father of his people!) again&s;t encroachments on their liberties, and the grievances are &s;uffered to remain, by tho&s;e that are about him, &s;till unredre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, if the public welfare and honor, peace and happine&s;s of a kingdom mu&s;t be &s;acrificed to all the little dark cabals, and private per&s;onal piques, re&s;entments, and revenge of tho&s;e in power, who, while pretending to be the King's friends, are only &s;ecuring po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions for them&s;elves, and titles, places, and rever&s;ions for their wives and families! I &s;ay, if even the&s;e few things are &s;o (and many more I could mention) how unrea&s;onable, fooli&s;h, and ab&s;urd, are all our complaints of the badne&s;s of the times! Prime mini&s;ters, politicians, and others, may offer plans, &s;chemes ways and means to make a nation great and powerful as they call it; but let me tell them, that they mu&s;t, fir&s;t of all, make it religious and virtuous, and then it will be

truly great; and therefore, there is but one thing that can po&s;&s;ibly &s;ave this nation, and that is, by rouzing it from its &s;tupid lethargy of &s;in and wick|edne&s;s, with the Almighty thunder of &s;ome &s;ignal judgment! There is but one thing that can di&s;arm the Almighty from his thunder, and that is a nati|onal repentance and reformation! And there is but one thing more that can continue to &s;ave it, after it has been thus rouzed and reformed, and that is, by keeping the ri&s;ing generation to a proper &s;en&s;e of their duty in catechi&s;ing, or in&s;tructing them in the principles of religion! But all nations, like the human body, have their infancy, growth, and per|fection. How far we of this kingdom are pa&s;t that perfection, and our colonies abroad every year ari|&s;ing towards their growth, needs no great &s;agacity to fore&s;ee, or to foretel, that the &s;eat of the Briti&s;h Empire may be tran&s;lated over there much &s;ooner than we imagine. The &s;evere and unnatural treat|ment, which the colonies have felt &s;ince the war, has not yet withdrawn their affections; but when chil|dren find the mother is re&s;olved to be arbitrary, oppre&s;&s;ive, and tyrannical, no wonder they, in their turn, endeavor to do the be&s;t they can for them|&s;elves. How far tho&s;e in the admini&s;tration of affairs of this, and our other two kingdoms, are con|cerned, either pa&s;&s;ively or actively, in enabling them to go on in this manner, I leave to their own con|&s;ciences to determine; but, to be &s;ure, all &s;uch mu&s;t be the king's real friends, and, no doubt, the &s;ame hone&s;t and worthy friends to the&s;e poor, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and depopulating countries! I have now done my duty &s;o as becomes every hone&s;t Briton, real patriot, and true mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, in crying aloud (as the prophet &s;ays) and &s;paring not, even from the throne down to the cottage, in &s;hewing my countrymen their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and the hou&s;e of England their &s;ins; in being (as St. Paul &s;ays) in|&s;tant
