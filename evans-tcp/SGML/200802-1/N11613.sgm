<P>HOME-FELT joys, this day, po&s;&s;e&s;s our brea&s;ts, on account of the di&s;tingui&s;hing ble&s;&s;ings of LIBERTY and FREEDOM, which illu&s;triou&s;ly exert them|&s;elves, animating the members of this community.</P>
<P>LIBERTY! the darling of generous and noble &s;ouls, extends her hand once more, without controul, to give in her &s;uffrages for men to rule us in the fear of GOD.</P>
<P>WITH gratitude to the Almighty Pre&s;erver of our privileges, we &s;ee the returns of this joyful anniver&s;a|ry; and the leaders of this people a&s;&s;embled, to im|plore wi&s;dom and influence from heaven, to conduct our public affairs at this difficult and trying day.</P>
<P>GLOOMY and threatning indeed, is the cloud impend|ing our land and nation. Our privileges, civil and &s;a|cred,
<PB N="6" REF="014675_0005_0F948B87DB2BE308">
are imminently endangered. Under the&s;e alarming circum&s;tances, the admonitory language of divine pro|vidence and revelation is this, <HI>Stand fa&s;t in the liberty wherewith CHRIST hath made us free.</HI></P>
<P>BY an allegory borrowed from what is written con|cerning <HI>Sarah</HI> and <HI>Hagar,</HI> and their re&s;pective offspring, the apo&s;tle had been illu&s;trating their di&s;tingui&s;hing privileges: Immediately upon which, our text is in|troduced&mdash;of a noble import, con&s;idered only as re&s;|pecting chri&s;tian liberty. But it is propo&s;ed, upon this occa&s;ion, to apply in a more general view, what might be &s;ugge&s;ted with a particular reference.</P>
<P>WE have glorious privileges a&s;&s;erted&mdash;liberty and freedom belonging to us, not merely as men, originally created in GOD'S image, holding a di&s;tingui&s;hed rank in his creation, but al&s;o as chri&s;tians, redeemed by the blood of CHRIST. The divine author, purcha&s;er and be&s;tower of all the&s;e mercies and ble&s;&s;ings, expre&s;ly men|tioned CHRIST JESUS, who, by his perfect obedience and the &s;acrifice of him&s;elf made compleat atonement for &s;in&mdash;purcha&s;ed reconciliation with GOD&mdash;temporal favours and ble&s;&s;ings for a ruined world, and eternal glory for all that truly believe in him.</P>
<P>HERE is al&s;o a very important duty, enjoined by the highe&s;t authority, to exert our&s;elves in maintaining and defending our liberties and privileges. <HI>Stand fa&s;t,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

WHAT is IMPLIED in the DUTY ENJOINED, to STAND FAST THEREIN.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>FIRST. As to our liberty and freedom, civil and re|ligious. The&s;e may be con&s;idered as general terms, in|cluding our ine&s;timable rights and privileges of a civil and &s;acred nature.</P>
<P>MAN was originally formed &s;uch a creature, and plac|ed in tho&s;e circum&s;tances that infinite wi&s;dom determined it was not good for him to live alone. The glorious CREATOR put him under &s;trong and endearing obliga|tions of convenience, inclination and nece&s;&s;ity to in|duce him into &s;ociety, furni&s;hing him with rea&s;on and language to continue and enjoy it. For perpetual &s;oli|tude the human mind was not adapted, nor the &s;trength of an individual proportionate to his nece&s;&s;ities. From hence &s;ociety appears convenient and nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>THE &s;tate of nature is a &s;tate of freedom and equali|ty. No one can therein challenge a &s;uperiority over o|thers. Every man was amenable to GOD alone. Nor could he invade his neighbour's property, or abridge his natural liberty, without violating one of nature's mo&s;t &s;acred laws. In this apo&s;tate world, the inability of mo|ral virtue renders government ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>THE motives upon which individuals made a particu|lar &s;urrender of that plenitude of power which they po&s;&s;e&s;s in a &s;tate of nature, are abundantly obvious. For, though in that &s;tate, no one was &s;ubject to the controul of another; but in this re&s;pect was ab&s;olute lord of his own per&s;on and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; yet every one being his equal, and the greater part no &s;trict ob&s;ervers of ju&s;tice and equity; the enjoyment of property, in this &s;ituation mu&s;t be very precarious. Therefore he volun|tarily relinqui&s;hes that condition which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily
<PB N="8" REF="014675_0007_0F948B890DE7F790">
be attended with uncea&s;ing fears and dangers, to unite with others for the mutual pre&s;ervation of their lives, li|berties and properties. But then&mdash;freedom from ab&s;o|lute, de&s;potic power is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary unto, and clo&s;ely connected with a man's pre&s;ervation that he cannot part with it, but by what forfeits his pre&s;ervation and life together.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide Lock on Gov. Black&s;t. Comment, &amp;c.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>WHEN mankind form into &s;ociety and &s;ubmit to the nece&s;&s;ary re&s;trictions and &s;ubordinations of government, it lies with the people, under GOD, to determine who &s;hall make and execute the laws by which they &s;hall be governed. Man's liberty in &s;ociety is to be under no legi&s;lative power, but that e&s;tabli&s;hed in the common wealth; and to be &s;ubject to no human laws but tho&s;e enacted by that legi&s;lature. The&s;e are conceived to be fir&s;t principles, coeval with time, and &s;anctified by u&s;e&mdash;of importance in the di&s;putes of the pre&s;ent day.</P>
<P>As to the rights and immunities of a free &s;tate, we have been mo&s;t highly favoured of the LORD. When new &s;tates were founded upon the ruins of the Roman empire, a free form of government, obtained in <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and various other parts of Europe. Under the <HI>Saxon</HI> heptarchy and after the union of tho&s;e kingdoms, liberty prevailed in <HI>England,</HI> as hi&s;tory informs us.</P>
<P>UPON the Norman conque&s;t, de&s;potic power was e&s;|tabli&s;hed by King William the fir&s;t. His &s;on, to &s;ecure his crown, &s;olemnly engaged to re&s;tore it's ancient laws and government. Similar promi&s;es were made by &s;ome &s;ucceeding Princes, who neglected the due performance and involved the nation in a bloody war. The Barons and people nobly exerted them&s;elves to recover their li|berties, 'till the charter of Briti&s;h privileges, the Magna Charta, was &s;olemnly confirmed by King John. Sordid
<PB N="9" REF="014675_0008_0F948B89798474F0">
attempts have &s;ince been made, to deprive the people of their ine&s;timable rights; which have ever involved their authors in wretched misfortunes; terminating in the lo&s;s of their lives or crowns. The lawle&s;s endea|vours of Charles the fir&s;t, to e&s;tabli&s;h arbitrary govern|ment, introduced a civil war, which raged until his blood quenched the flame. His &s;on, King James the &s;econd, enterprized ab&s;olute rule, and had almo&s;t &s;ub|verted the civil and religious liberties of his country. At this critical time GOD rai&s;ed up, and the people, vi|gilant of their rights, invited over the Prince of Orange; upon which James abdicated the throne and kingdom. Thus hath GOD pre&s;erved our nation, in times pa&s;t.</P>
<P>THE American colonies in general, and <HI>Connecticut</HI> in &s;pecial, have enjoyed mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hing privileges. If a perfect civil con&s;titution cannot be found exi&s;ting; yet our own we e&s;teem, by far, the mo&s;t eligible; the ad|vantages of which are illu&s;triou&s;ly demon&s;trated at the pre&s;ent day. Our legi&s;lature con&s;i&s;ts of two hou&s;es, an|nually elected by the freemen of the corporation, under the &s;acred &s;olemnity of an oath, to give in their &s;uffrages &s;o as they verily believe in their con&s;ciences may be mo&s;t conducive to the be&s;t good of the government. Beyond all di&s;pute, frequent elections are a noble pre&s;ervative from the execrable &s;in of venality in rulers. Our General A&s;&s;embly, thus compo&s;ed, enact our laws, appoint our judges, erect our courts, pre&s;cribe their powers, and adju&s;t the method of procedure. Our rulers are not fo|reigners obtruded upon us, from whence, interference of intere&s;t and di&s;affection would naturally ari&s;e. While the people retain their elective power, rulers mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily &s;hare very largely in the choice&s;t affections of a free people. Such hath been the public virtue of this people, that tho&s;e in highe&s;t &s;eats of honor, dignity and authority, in this colony, have been revered for their
<PB N="10" REF="014675_0009_0F948B8A337CF438">
&s;uperior wi&s;dom and integrity, virtue, magnanimity and piety. The public have been &s;erved, from time to time, by men of probity and a public &s;pirit. In&s;tead of the bramble in Jotham's parable, to di&s;tre&s;s us, we have &s;at under the &s;hadow of a plea&s;ant and fruitful vine&mdash;Our air healthful&mdash;our &s;oil fertile, liberally rewarding the diligent hu&s;bandmen&mdash;yielding different crops for our &s;u&s;tenance. If one fail, a famine may not en&s;ue, as it doth in many countries. Every town is a corporation inve&s;ted with &s;ingular power to &s;uppre&s;s immoralities which are provoking to GOD, and de&s;tructive to civil &s;o|ciety. Every family is entitled to the &s;trength of the community for its defence. We have enjoyed all the &s;weets and felt very little of the burdens of government.</P>
<P>WHILE our government is &s;o popular; yet where are civil rulers and executive courts &s;o truly revered as in this colony? Where is &s;o little of riotous and factious behaviour?</P>
<P>AS our civil liberties and privileges are nearly connect|ed with, and greatly promotive of our religious (on which account they are chiefly to be e&s;teemed) &s;o our religious privileges are not inferior to our civil. Every one has GOD'S word, may read and judge for him&s;elf&mdash;may wor|&s;hip GOD in the way he verily believes Heaven will ap|prove. Every eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;ociety may chu&s;e its own mini&s;ter, and provide for his &s;upport. Happily deli|vered from Romi&s;h &s;uper&s;tition, unappointed rites and ceremonies, and that eccle&s;ia&s;tical hierarchy, which neither we, nor our fathers were able to bear&mdash;we <HI>may &s;erve God without fear.</HI> Difference of &s;entiment re&s;|pecting the non-e&s;&s;entials of religion, &s;eems one of the unavoidable con&s;equences of man's dreadful apo&s;tacy. None may impo&s;e for doctrine, the commandments of men; or force others to believe with them. Surely
<PB N="11" REF="014675_0010_0F948B8AF5ECFA38">
the &s;acred rights of con&s;cience, are ever to be treated with utmo&s;t delicacy. But if any under pretence of con&s;cience, &s;ap the foundation of civil &s;ociety, or ma|terially injure it, they are to be re&s;trained by the ci|vil arm. Civil rulers are GOD'S mini&s;ters for good to mankind&mdash;a terror to evil works, and to puni&s;h evil doers, by &s;alutary laws, faithfully executed. In fa|vour of virtue, to &s;uppre&s;s immorality, and &s;upport religion, we have a &s;y&s;tem of excellent laws enacted, while different per&s;ua&s;ions enjoy the mo&s;t generous li|berty and freedom. What greater civil or chri&s;tian liberty can be enjoyed, or even wi&s;h'd for, than the in|habitants of this colony are indulged?</P>
<P>THAT no external advantage may be wanting, to render us happy, if we are not wanting to our&s;elves; we have a flouri&s;hing &s;eminary of learning in the co|lony, for the in&s;truction of our youth; from whence many &s;treams have i&s;&s;ued, rejoicing the church and city of our GOD.</P>
<P>A PEOPLE thus <HI>exalted to heaven,</HI> &s;hould be all grati|tude to GOD for di&s;criminating favours&mdash;emulous to excel in obedience and &s;ubjection, by leading mo&s;t <HI>quiet and peaceable lives, in all godline&s;s and hone&s;ty.</HI></P>
<P>SECONDLY, To con&s;ider by whom the&s;e privileges were purcha&s;ed for, and be&s;towed upon us?</P>
<P>ALL things were originally created by CHRIST. A|dam was placed at the head of this lower creation, with dominion over all creatures therein&mdash;crowned <HI>with glo|ry and honor, but little inferior to the angels in heaven.</HI>&mdash;Soon did man dreadfully apo&s;tatize from a &s;tate of pri|meval integrity. This was an act of the mo&s;t horrid trea&s;on again&s;t the KING of KINGS. Thereby the whole patrimony of temporal and &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings was con|fi&s;cated.
<PB N="12" REF="014675_0011_0F948B8BC2458EE8">
CHRIST JESUS interpo&s;ed, redeemed the ali|enated inheritance, <HI>being appointed heir of all things, vi&s;i|ble and invi&s;ible.</HI> By purcha&s;e and by power, <HI>he delivers from the bondage of corruption, and vindicates into the glo|rious liberty of the children of God.</HI></P>
<P>HAVE &s;inners a reprieve from hopele&s;s torment?&mdash;The means of grace afforded?&mdash;The &s;chools of CHRIST opened?&mdash;His go&s;pel preached, and ordinances ad|mini&s;tered, to train us up for heaven?&mdash;Have we free acce&s;s to GOD, and hopes of glory? All flow from CHRIST as their foundation. Are temporal favours confer'd upon &s;inful creatures? They come from CHRIST who is <HI>heir of all things, and by whom all things con&s;i&s;t.</HI> Every ble&s;&s;ing is therefore to be con&s;idered as flowing to us through the blood of JESUS. Civil government is his in&s;titution. <HI>The powers that be, are ordained of God. By him, princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth.</HI> In &s;cripture, we have the character of civil ru|lers decypher'd&mdash;the de&s;ign of government pointed out&mdash;the duty of &s;ubjects enforced. In carrying into ex|ecution the glorious purpo&s;es of divine providence and grace, GOD hath cho&s;en, in numberle&s;s in&s;tances, to u&s;e the mediation of others. Agreeably, civil rulers are his <HI>mini&s;ters for good to mankind;</HI> while CHRIST is the origi|nal from whence flow all our ble&s;&s;ings.</P>
<P>THIRDLY, What is implied in the duty enjoin'd, <HI>Stand fa&s;t in the liberty wherewith Chri&s;t hath made us free.</HI></P>
<P>THAT others may endeavour by fraud or violence to deprive us of our ine&s;timable privileges, is here &s;up|po&s;ed; yet we mu&s;t a&s;&s;ert them; highly e&s;teem, and con&s;cientiou&s;ly improve them; zealou&s;ly, and with ut|mo&s;t vigour, exert our&s;elves to maintain and defend them.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="014675_0012_0F948B8C875A2BF0">
THE duty enjoin'd in our text &s;uppo&s;es that others may endeavour, by fraud or violence to deprive us of our ine&s;timable rights and privileges. We need'nt re|vert to the hi&s;tory of pa&s;t ages, to find this ex|emplified. Not long &s;ince, the Briti&s;h parliament made &s;olemn declaration, "<HI>That it has a right to make laws binding upon the colonies, in all ca&s;es what&s;oever.</HI> In con&s;e|quence of which, taxes have been impo&s;ed upon us without our con&s;ent&mdash;chartered privileges vacated&mdash;various cruel edicts pa&s;&s;ed. The time would fail us to enumerate and particularly con&s;ider tho&s;e which vi|olate our e&s;&s;ential rights. To enfore which edicts, fleets and armies have been &s;ent over, compelling us ei|ther to di&s;obey the divine precept in our text, or engage in a civil war. The&s;e colonies have nobly cho&s;en the latter. Whoever will impartially con&s;ider the tragical &s;cenes of the pa&s;t year, and the cau&s;es of them (me thinks) cannot help but &s;ee that our precious privile|ges have been invaded; and that heaven hath arre&s;ted the hand of violence in its ravages. At <HI>Lexington,</HI> our countrymen were attack'd, fired upon, and &s;ome of them impiou&s;ly &s;lain. From thence the inhuman mur|derers of their fellow-&s;ubjects, proceeded to <HI>Concord;</HI> up|on which an action en&s;ued "<HI>inglorious to the Briti&s;h arms.</HI>" The horrors of a civil war then commenced.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the violence u&s;ed to deprive us of our ine&s;timable rights and privileges, we are under indi&s;pen&s;ible obligations to a&s;&s;ert them. As rational creatures, and profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians, a competent know|ledge of, and acquaintance with them is to be ob|tained. What is &s;acred by the laws of GOD, nature and compact, may not be buried in oblivion, or &s;unk under the carnal rubbi&s;h of luxury and &s;tupidity. The rights belonging to us, as men and chri&s;tians, we are to under&s;tand and a&s;&s;ert.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="014675_0013_0F948B8D59659640">
AGAIN. We mu&s;t highly e&s;teem, and con&s;cientiou&s;ly improve them. They demand our highe&s;t attention. GOD'S glory, our own and other's be&s;t good, with hea|ven's &s;pecial command, lay us under the mo&s;t &s;acred obligations thus to value them. Were they of trifling importance, or our necks galled with the yoke of de&s;|potic power and oppre&s;&s;ion (tho&s;e engines of accumu|lated mi&s;ery and de&s;truction to mankind) our ca&s;e had been far different. But (ble&s;&s;ed be GOD) from tho&s;e dread|ful cur&s;es we are hitherto delivered. We are called to LIBERTY, one of heaven's choice&s;t ble&s;&s;ings to man|kind. Amid&s;t the various calamities of life, LIBERTY admini&s;ters con&s;olation&mdash;redoubles the plea&s;ures of our highe&s;t gratifications&mdash;in&s;pires the human brea&s;t with noble&s;t &s;entiments&mdash;dilates the heart&mdash;expands the &s;oul, and is the &s;ource of almo&s;t every thing excellent and de&s;irable on earth. This animates indu&s;try and oeco|nomy&mdash;promotes commerce&mdash;procures wealth&mdash;che|ri&s;hes the liberal arts and &s;ciences, and wears a mo&s;t friendly a&s;pect upon all the mo&s;t important intere&s;ts of mankind, while it encourages and promotes the pro|fe&s;&s;ion and practice of religion.</P>
<P>LIBERTY is the glory of a community, and en&s;ures its felicity &s;o long as it is retained. SLAVERY, on the other hand, deba&s;es the mind&mdash;clogs the fine&s;t move|ments of the &s;oul; di&s;courages indu&s;try, frugality, and every thing prai&s;e-worthy; introduces ignorance and poverty, with the mo&s;t fordid vices, and univer&s;al mi|&s;ery. How &s;triking the contra&s;t! If this cannot convey any tolerable idea of the ble&s;&s;ings of FREE|DOM, let the hi&s;tory of mankind inform us, and the ab|ject condition of tho&s;e people where &s;lavery clanks her chains, contra&s;ted with tho&s;e that are free born. In <HI>Turkey,</HI> every hou&s;e, at the death of it's ma&s;ter, is at the di&s;po&s;al of the Grand Segnior.</P>

<P>OUR ever memorable ance&s;tors, left their native coun|try, in times unfriendly to liberty, civil and religious; and gave illu&s;trious proofs of ri&s;ing &s;uperior to the mo&s;t di&s;couraging ob&s;tacles; leaving their hou&s;es, lands, and tendere&s;t connections, with every thing dear and e&s;ti|mable among men, for the undi&s;turbed fruition of tho&s;e rights, &s;acred by the laws of GOD and nature. For this they brav'd the dangers of the &s;ea, &s;urmounting perils, want, toil, famine, and even the &s;word of the wilderne&s;s; among the a&s;perities of nature, &s;eeking an a&s;ylum for liberty, which they &s;ought in vain from the ju&s;tice and policy of a powerful empire. GOD &s;ent them into the world to plead the cau&s;e of liberty, and prepare we&s;tern man&s;ions again&s;t arbitrary power, for the per&s;ecuted lovers of freedom. Having by purcha&s;e or conque&s;t, obtained an indi&s;putable title to their lands; they cou'd'nt but think the produce, by the divine ble&s;&s;ing on their labors, to be their property, with an exclu&s;ive right of di&s;po&s;al. Property without this, is but an in&s;ignificant name. To them was ratified a legi&s;lative power, re&s;pecting their internal policy.

In whatever hands the power of taxation is lodged, it includes and implies all other power. He adds, my Lords, I have ventur|ed to lay my thoughts before you, on the greate&s;t na|tional concern that ever came under your deliberation, with as much hone&s;ty as you will find from others, and with a melancholy a&s;&s;urance that not a word of it will be regarded. And yet, my Lords, by your permi&s;&s;ion, I will wa&s;te one &s;hort argument more on the &s;ame cau&s;e. My Lords, I look on America as the only great nur&s;ery of freemen now left upon the face of the earth.

<P>THIS is the only provincial, General A&s;&s;embly upon this continent which hath not been harra&s;&s;ed and per|plex'd by being adjourned, prorogued or di&s;&s;olved by its Governor, except one, which was nece&s;&s;itated to ap|point a new one.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rhode-I&s;land colony was reduced to this nece&s;&s;ity la&s;t year.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>GENTLEMEN,</P>
<P>WAS it ever of equal nece&s;&s;ity and importance that our civil and military officers be known friends to their country. Your eyes will be upon the faithful of the land to &s;u&s;tain every office you are entru&s;ted to be&s;tow. You will never &s;uffer our precious privileges, &s;o dear|ly purcha&s;ed and tran&s;mitted, to be lo&s;t by your neglect. Should you &s;ink with the weight of the community up|on your &s;houlders, O! how dreadful.</P>

WE look to you to con&s;ult mea&s;ures nece&s;&s;ary to per|petuate our liberty.

<P>HONORED GENTLEMEN,</P>
<P>THE LORD of HOSTS hath rai&s;ed you up and called you to mo&s;t important &s;ervices.

<P>RESPECTABLE AUDIENCE:</P>
<P>THE time is &s;hort&mdash;eternity near, and your work great to prepare therefor. <HI>We are amba&s;&s;adors for</HI> CHRIST, <HI>as though</HI> GOD <HI>did be&s;eech you by us: We pray you, in</HI> CHRIST'S <HI>&s;tead, be ye reconciled to</HI> GOD.

Our land is &s;acrilegiou&s;ly polluted with the blood of our fellow citizens, impiou&s;ly &s;hed by wor&s;e than &s;avage hands. We are involved in the horrors of a civil war. Let your heads, hands, fortunes and lives be devoted and con&s;ecrated to your country's good. When our ho&s;t goeth forth, again&s;t the mo&s;t unnatural enemy, let us keep our&s;elves from every wicked thing, as we would not pull down Heaven's vengeance upon the land, and tho&s;e who defend the common cau&s;e. Let us cry mightily to GOD, and be careful to engage JESUS to be our <HI>Captain-General.</HI></P>
<P>FOR Heaven's &s;ake and for our own, let us arou&s;e, my countrymen, and act up to the dignity of our cha|racter as free-born Americans.
