<L>THE American world, as our hi&s;tories &s;ay,</L>

<L>The &s;ons of the Tartars that came from the we&s;t.</L>

In a mere &s;tate of nature, untutor'd, untaught,</L>

<L>No lawyers, recorders, nor keepers of rolls;</L>
<L>No learned phy&s;icians vile no&s;trums conceal'd&mdash;</L>
<L>Their druggi&s;t was nature&mdash;her &s;hop was the field.</L>
<L>In the mid&s;t of their fore&s;ts how happy and ble&s;t,</L>
<L>In the &s;kin of a bear or a buffaloe dre&s;t!</L>
<L>No care to perplex, and no luxury &s;een</L>
<L>But the fea&s;t, and the &s;ong, and the dance on the green,</L>
<L>Some bow'd to the moon, and &s;ome wor&s;hipp'd the &s;un,</L>
<L>And the king and the captain were center'd in one;</L>
<L>In a cabin, they met, on their councils of &s;tate,</L>
<L>Where age and experience alone might debate:</L>
<L>With quibbles they never e&s;&s;ay'd to beguile,</L>
<L>And nature had taught them the orator's &s;tile;</L>
<L>No pomp they affected, nor quaintly refin'd</L>
<L>The nervous idea that glanc'd on the mind.</L>
<L>When hunting or battle invited to arms,</L>
<L>The women they left to take care of their farms&mdash;</L>
<L>The toils of the &s;ummer did winter repay,</L>
<L>While &s;nug in their cabins they &s;nor'd it away.</L>

<L>Unin&s;tructed in commerce, unpractic'd in gain,</L>

<L>Columbus came over, that bold Genoe&s;e.</L>
<L>From records authentic, the date we can &s;how,</L>
<L>One thou&s;and four hundred ninety and two</L>

<L>What an era was this, above all that had pa&s;s'd,</L>
<L>To yield &s;uch a trea&s;ure, di&s;cover'd at la&s;t&mdash;</L>

Yet the &s;chemes of Columbus, however well plann'd,</L>
<L>Were &s;carely &s;ufficient to find the main land;</L>
<L>On the i&s;lands alone with the natives he &s;poke,</L>
<L>Except when he enter'd the great Oronoque:</L>
<L>In this he re&s;embled old Mo&s;es, the Jew,</L>
<L>Who, roving about with his wrong-headed crew,</L>
<L>When at length the reward was no longer deny'd,</L>
<L>From the top of mount Pi&s;gah he &s;aw it, and dy'd.</L>
<L>The&s;e i&s;lands and worlds in the wat'ry expan&s;e,</L>

<L>No wonder, indeed, he was &s;mit with &s;urpri&s;e&mdash;</L>

<L>We have only to thank him for finding the route;</L>
<L>The&s;e climes to the northward, more &s;tormy and cold,</L>
<L>Were re&s;erv'd for the efforts of Cabot the bold.</L>

<L>From Florida's cape did Cabot explore</L>
<L>To the fa&s;t frozen regions of cold Labradore.</L>
<L>In the year fourteen hundred and ninety and eight</L>
<L>He came, as the annals of England relate:</L>
<L>But finding no gold in the lengthy domain,</L>
<L>And coa&s;ting the country, he left it again.</L>

<L>Thus bani&s;h'd forever, and leaving the &s;od,</L>

<L>They were, without doubt, a delightful collection;</L>
<L>&mdash;Some came to be rid of a Stuart's direction;</L>
<L>Some &s;ail'd with a view to dominion and riches,</L>
<L>Some to pray without book, and a few to hang witches;</L>

The fir&s;t that attempted to enter this &s;treight,</L>

<L>Joy in thy &s;miles and court thy equal &s;way.</L>

<HEAD>CHARACTER OF ST. TAMANY.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY WILLIAM PRICHARD.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>IMMORTAL Tamany, of Indian race,</L>
<L>Great in the field, and foremo&s;t in the chace!</L>
<L>No puny &s;aint was he, with fa&s;ting pale,</L>
<L>He climb'd the mountain, and he &s;wept the vale,</L>
<L>Ru&s;h'd thro' the torrent with unequall'd might;</L>
<L>Your ancient &s;aints would tremble at the &s;ight;</L>
<L><PB N="224" REF="026795_0227_0FD1CE59E8BBCBA0">
Caught the &s;wift boar, and &s;wifter deer, with ca&s;e,</L>
<L>And work'd a thou&s;and miracles like the&s;e.</L>
<L>To public views he added private ends,</L>
<L>And lov'd his country mo&s;t, and next his friends;</L>
<L>With courage long he &s;trove to ward the blow,</L>
<L>(Courage we all re&s;pect ev'n in a foe,)</L>
<L>And when each effort he in vain had tried,</L>
<L>Kindled the flame in which he bravely died!</L>
<L>Let the full horn to Tamany go round,</L>
<L>His &s;ame let every hone&s;t tongue re&s;ound!</L>
<L>With him let ev'ry gen'rous patriot vie,</L>
<L>To live in freedom, or with honour die.</L>
