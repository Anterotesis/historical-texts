<P>CIVIL government is an in&s;titution appointed by God, for the good and well-being of man|kind. The nece&s;&s;ity and importance of this in&s;ti|tution may be inferred from the wi&s;dom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nd goodne&s;s of him who hath appointed the &s;ame. The divine being has &s;een fit to e&s;tabli&s;h his law, as a perfect, unerring rule for men to walk by&punc; a due regard to which is the foundation of all true hap|pine&s;s. And were every one di&s;po&s;ed to walk agreeably to this rule, it would &s;uper&s;ede the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of any civil e&s;tabli&s;hment; for then every one would do to others as he would have them do unto him. But &s;uch is the unhappy &s;tate of man|kind, &s;ince the apo&s;tacy, that they are di&s;po&s;ed, every man to &s;eek his own, and not the thing of another. And if there is nothing to prevent their covetous de&s;ires, and wicked pur&s;uits, but their own con&s;ciences, and the divine law, the penalty of which none can inflict but God only, they will lie, and &s;teal, and de&s;troy both them&s;elves and others. Hence ari&s;es the nece&s;&s;ity of civil government, which
<PB N="6" REF="021401_0004_0FB38475CD6B0730">
God, in his infinite wi&s;dom, has &s;een fit to e&s;tabli&s;h, and which, duly admini&s;tered, is the foundation of the peace, order and happine&s;s of civil &s;ociety; and is one excellent mean to advance the peace, order and happine&s;s of chri&s;tian &s;ociety; &s;o that the in|&s;pired writer (&s;peaking of civil government) &s;ays, <HI>If the foundation be de&s;troyed, what can the righteous do,</HI> P&s;al. x. 3. King David had peculiar advantage to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> what influence the one had upon the other, as he was called in the early part of life, not only to fill an important <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eat in the civil department, but al&s;o to fill a more important one in the religious department&punc; to be a type and forerunner of Chri&s;t, the great head of the church. And as the faithful admini|&s;trations of government in the&s;e two different branches, is of va&s;t importance to mankind, &s;o he earne&s;tly prays for each; <HI>Let thy prie&s;ts be clothed with righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> P&s;al. cxxxii. 9. <HI>Give to the king thy judgments, and thy righteou&s;ne&s;s unto the king's &s;on; that he may judge the poor, and &s;ave the needy, and break in pieces the oppre&s;&s;or,</HI> P&s;al. lxxii. 1. 4. David was now old and &s;tricken in age; his long improv|ed judgment, which was ripened with the experience of many years, qualified him to give the be&s;t advice in matters of the greate&s;t importance: <HI>For days &s;hall &s;peak, and the multitude of years &s;hall teach wi&s;dom,</HI> Job xxxii. 7. The words of the text come with peculiar weight and &s;olemnity, as they are the la&s;t words of a dying prince, giving advice to his &s;ur|viving kingdom; and are therefore worthy to be|come the object of our &s;erious attention and diligent enquiry at this time, which will be in the following manner.</P>

<P>I. It is the will of Heaven, that there &s;hould be civil rulers.</P>
<P>Mo&s;es was called immediately by God to take the rule and government of his people I&s;rael. Saul, David, and many others, received their royal crowns by &s;pecial direction from heaven. Not only kings but tho&s;e who fill &s;tations of le&s;s importance in civil government, are equally appointed by God, as may be &s;een, Prov. viii. 13. <HI>By me kings reign, and princes decree ju&s;tice; by me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth.</HI> Our Saviour was &s;ubject to their authority, and paid tribute, when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> was demanded of him. And the apo&s;tle Paul is very particular in the point. <HI>Let every &s;oul be &s;ub|ject unto the higher powers, for there is no power <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">t of God; the powers that be, are ordained of God:</HI> Rom. xiii. 1. The apo&s;tle Peter enjoins the &s;ame; <HI>Submit your&s;elves to every ordinance of man, for the Lord's &s;ake; whether it be to the king as &s;upreme, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> governors as unto them that are &s;ent by him, for the puni&s;hment of evil doers, and for the prai&s;e of them that do well;</HI> 1 Peter, ii. 14. God has te&s;tified his will, in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of civil rulers, in requiring that <HI>&s;upplications, prayers and interce&s;&s;ions be made for all men, for kings, and for all in authority, that we may lead a peaceable and quiet life, in all godline&s;s and hone&s;ty;</HI> 1 Tim. ii. 1, 2. And in that we are forbid to &s;peak evil of rulers: <HI>for it is written, thou &s;hal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> not &s;peak evil of the ruler of thy people;</HI> Acts xxiii. 5. Al&s;o from a con&s;ideration of the great u&s;e which
<PB N="8" REF="021401_0006_0FB38478CD56DB20">
God has made of them in days pa&s;t, and the u&s;e which he &s;ays he will make of them in time to come&punc; when he will pour out his &s;pirit, and cau&s;e his church to increa&s;e, and become univer&s;al; even then <HI>kings &s;hall be their nur&s;ing fathers, and queens thy nur&s;ing mothers;</HI> I&s;a. xlix. 23. <HI>Thou &s;halt al&s;o &s;uck the brea&s;ts of kings, and thou &s;halt know that I the Lord, am thy Saviour and thy Redeemer;</HI> I&s;a. lx. 16. The&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, from the many that might be ad|duced, are &s;ufficient to &s;how, that it is the will of Heaven, that there &s;hould be civil rulers. I now pa&s;s on to &s;how in the</P>
<P>II. Place, that it is required of tho&s;e who rule, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> they be ju&s;t men. And this will appear, if we con&s;ider the nature and importance of the bu&s;ine&s;s a&s;&s;igned them to do:&mdash;as they are appointed to u&s;e their power to &s;uppre&s;s iniquity, and all acts of in|ju&s;tice. It is exceedingly natural for the human heart to break forth into tho&s;e acts of wickedne&s;s and impiety, which are di&s;honorable to God, and de&s;tructive to the happine&s;s of human &s;ociety. The hearts of the &s;ons of men are full of evil, <HI>and be|cau&s;e &s;entence again&s;t an evil work is not &s;peedily exe|cuted, their hearts are fully &s;et within them to do evil;</HI> Eccle. viii. 11: and madne&s;s is in their hearts while they live. Notwith&s;tanding Heaven is continually u&s;ing the mo&s;t powerful means to curb tho&s;e wicked pa&s;&s;ions, and prevent the outbreaking of inju&s;tice&mdash;&s;uch as the various calamities and &s;orrows of life, which fill the world with pain and di&s;tre&s;s; the terrors of death, the alluring pro&s;pects of a heavenly paradi&s;e, and the fearful glooms of eternal dark|ne&s;s; yet mankind will break over the&s;e re&s;traints, as if they were but &s;hadows, or mere cyphers of no avail: and if there was nothing more, the earth
<PB N="9" REF="021401_0007_0FB3847A4DDE3F48">
would be filled with violence. But God has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> plea&s;ed to appoint other means:&mdash;even civil rulers, who by the ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven, have oftentimes curbed tho&s;e wicked pa&s;&s;ions, and prevented their breaking out into open acts of inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Rulers are appointed to &s;tand in the gap, and draw the &s;word of civil ju&s;tice again&s;t all open of|fenders, and &s;o to become a terror to evil doers: and the nature of their bu&s;ine&s;s, and de&s;ign of their office is &s;uch, that no one can act in the character of a faithful ruler, but he who is ju&s;t:&mdash;there is no way to prevent the growth of inju&s;tice, but only in a way of ju&s;tice. The prevalency of &s;ome things may be prevented many ways, but the prevalency of inju&s;tice can be prevented only in one way, viz. in a way of ju&s;tice: therefore it is required of tho&s;e who are appointed to &s;uppre&s;s acts of inju&s;tice, that they be ju&s;t men.</P>
<P N="2">2. It will further appear, if we con&s;ider that the ruler is appointed to defend the liberty and proper|ty of his &s;ubjects. Liberty and property have ever been the objects of lawle&s;s ambition and avarice. An unbounded de&s;ire to have dominion over the&s;e, has been that great &s;pring which has moved tho&s;e migh|ty wheels, which have brought on tho&s;e revolutions which have taken place in the ri&s;ing and falling of kingdoms and empires. What in&s;pired Alexander, the Ce&s;ars, and other mighty conquerors, but the pro&s;pect of obtaining dominion over their fellow-|creatures, and having their liberty and property at their di&s;po&s;e? What moved antient Pharaoh to pur&s;ue, with his numerous ho&s;ts, the children of I&s;rael, with &s;uch intrepid zeal, but the pro&s;pects of
<PB N="10" REF="021401_0008_0FB3847BCD4A9680">
making them his &s;ervants for ever? And what has actuated &s;o many of our brethren, in a Chri&s;tian land, to counteract their own profe&s;&s;ion of liberty, to brave the dangers of the &s;ea, and hazard their lives among the African tribes, but a thir&s;t after riches, obtained at the expen&s;e of the liberty and property of their fellow-creatures? And how ready were we to take the alarm, when our Briti&s;h rulers called for &s;ome of our intere&s;t? They touched then the apple of our eye&mdash;and the univer&s;al cry was, "Liberty and property are invaded; the king and parliament are unju&s;t in government; they mu&s;t be re&s;i&s;ted even unto blood:" And by the ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven, we maintained our liberties, and &s;ome part of our properties, though at the expen&s;e of much trea&s;ure, at the hazard of a long and &s;ore war, and the lo&s;s of many thou&s;and lives. Yet our liberties and property were a trea&s;ure &s;o rich, that we thought the conque&s;t great, and the victory glorious. This trea&s;ure we commit to the care of our civil rulers; we hold our property under the civil power; we enjoy our liberty from their friendly aid and a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance. Let this e&s;tabli&s;hment be removed, and we have nothing that we can call our own. Our liber|ty and property would lie at the mercy of tho&s;e, who have no bounds to their lu&s;ts and avarice.&mdash;Therefore, rulers who are appointed to defend the&s;e, ought to be ju&s;t; for there is nothing that endan|gers them, but inju&s;tice: but when rulers are un|ju&s;t, the intere&s;t and liberty of the people become an ea&s;y prey to them, and the yoke of bondage is laid on by tho&s;e hands which are appointed to keep it off. As when an hone&s;t traveller, having fifty
<PB N="11" REF="021401_0009_0FB3847D4EE67400">
pounds in ca&s;h for his &s;upport, and fearing le&s;t he fall into the hands of wicked men, who will rob him of his trea&s;ure, commits it to the care of his landlord, to keep &s;afe; who takes the advantage of this betru&s;tment, and keeps the whole, and leaves the traveller to earn his pa&s;&s;age by con&s;tant labour: thus, when the wicked rule, the righteous mourn; but the ju&s;t ruler will &s;ave the needy, and break in pieces the oppre&s;&s;or.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is required of civil rulers, that they be ju&s;t, as they are rai&s;ed up and appointed by God, to be the mini&s;ters of his kingdom for good to the people, and to act in concert with the divine go|vernment, and be co-workers with God. The Di|vine Being never inve&s;ted any of his mini&s;ters with power to act in oppo&s;ition to his ju&s;t and righteous laws, but agreeably thereto: and therefore, not only the &s;afety of the people, but the honor of God, requires, that tho&s;e who rule, be ju&s;t men. So far as we can di&s;cover, through the medium of di|vine revelation, the admini&s;trations of government in the other world, it is perfectly ju&s;t; God renders to every one according to his ju&s;t de&s;erts: but the civil ruler is not to pattern after the examples of government in that world; but after Chri&s;t, who is our pattern in all things, who never inflicts pun|i&s;hment upon any of his creatures in this world above what they de&s;erve, but often far le&s;s than what they de&s;erve. Rulers may lay that mea&s;ure of puni&s;hment upon offenders, which will &s;ecure the honour of government, and the good of the people, and yet di&s;play their lenity and goodne&s;s, in making it much le&s;s than their crimes de&s;erve. This is con|&s;i&s;tent
<PB N="12" REF="021401_0010_0FB3847ECE98ADD8">
with public ju&s;tice, and agreeable to the ex|ample of our Saviour, <HI>who does good to the evil and unthankful, and &s;endeth rain upon the unjust as well as the ju&s;t.</HI> It is conceded by all, that mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel mu&s;t be ju&s;t, and exemplary, both in a public &amp; private capacity: it is equally required of civil ru|lers, that they be ju&s;t, both in their public and private capacity. Since they are both appointed by God, as his mini&s;ters for good to the people, they are both called to labour in the &s;ame field, to carry on the &s;ame important cau&s;e, to &s;upport truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s; though they are called to mini&s;ter in two different ways, yet they are to carry on the &s;ame work. Every thing that the civil power is called to do, is with a direct view to build up the kingdom of Chri&s;t, and to advance his cau&s;e and intere&s;t in the world. Any thing more or le&s;s is not required by him, who is given to be head over all things to his church. Therefore, tho&s;e who rule, mu&s;t be ju&s;t.</P>
<P>III. I come now, in the next place, to &s;how, why tho&s;e who rule, &s;hould rule in the fear of God.</P>
<P>And the fir&s;t rea&s;on, which comes under con&s;ide|ration, is, that they are accountable to God for all they do.</P>
<P>As they are dependent upon God for every degree of that power and authority, with which they are inve&s;ted, and for all tho&s;e abilities and advantages, with which they are favoured; &s;o they are account|able to God for the improvement of them: and if they are ju&s;t &amp; faithful in their &s;tation, their rewards will be proportionably great. Their reward will be great in this world, their characters will &s;hine as
<PB N="13" REF="021401_0011_0FB384804D44D9C0">
lights on the earth, they will have the be&s;t wi&s;hes and fervent prayers of the ju&s;t and wi&s;e, and the te&s;timony of every man's con&s;cience in their favour. Above all, they will have inward peace, ari&s;ing from a con&s;ideration of their being ju&s;t &amp; faithful, which will give them mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible joy, upon every turn of &s;erious thought and inquiry, which will remove the fearful glooms of decripped age, brighten the dark pro&s;pects of death and the grave, and open to their view an inexhau&s;tible trea&s;ure of good in the world beyond, where they &s;hall re&s;t from their la|bours, and their works &s;hall follow them; where they &s;hall receive their full reward, even life ever|la&s;ting.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another weighty rea&s;on may ari&s;e from the fearful &s;tate of tho&s;e, who do not rule in the fear of God. The&s;e are al&s;o accountable, and mu&s;t receive a ju&s;t recompence of reward. Their titles, pompous names, and dignified &s;tations, among men, will be no defence for them in the fight of God; <HI>"for he bringeth princes to nothing, and maketh the judges of the earth as vanity;"</HI> I&s;a. xl. 23. Proud Pharaoh, with all his chariots and hor&s;es, finds no more relief from the raging waves, than the meane&s;t of his &s;ub|jects. Bel&s;hazzar, that mighty prince of Babylon, when he &s;aw the handwriting upon the wall, was filled with &s;ore &s;urprize; the joints of his loins were loo&s;ed, and his knees &s;mote one again&s;t another.&mdash;Wicked rulers are not only expo&s;ed to the judg|ments of God here, but to a more fearful doom hereafter: for, <HI>when the Heavens depart as a &s;croll, when it is rolled together, and every mountain &amp; i&s;land moved out of their places; then the kings of the earth,
<PB N="14" REF="021401_0012_0FB38481CD64F480">
and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, will hide them&s;elves in the dens, and in the rocks of the mountains; and will &s;ay to the rocks and mountains, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of Him that &s;itting on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb; for the great day of his wrath is come, and who &s;hall be able to &s;tand.</HI> Rev. vi. 14, 15, 16, 17.</P>
<P>Rea&s;on 3. God will be glorified hereby. If ru|lers rule in the fear of God, it will give a vi&s;ible di&s;play of God's glory.&mdash;The &s;un which rules the day, the moon and &s;tars which rule the night, di&s;|play God's glory in the natural world. Rulers are like &s;uns and &s;tars, in the moral world; and when they rule in the fear of God, divine grace and glory appear in them, as it did in Mo&s;es, when he had been with God in the mount, or in our Saviour, on mount Tabor, when his face did &s;hine as the light.</P>
<P>Rea&s;on 4. Great good will not only ari&s;e to them, but to their &s;ubjects, and perhaps to generations yet unborn, if they rule in the fear of God. In ancient times, holy kings and ju&s;t rulers were a great ble&s;&s;ing to the people: things went well with the nation for their &s;akes; their holy example, and pious walk with God, were a continual te&s;timony of the truth and reality of religion, and had an excellent tendency to pre&s;erve the morals, and guide the minds of tho&s;e who were young and tender. Time would fail me to tell of <HI>Mo&s;es, Jo&s;hua, David, Jo&s;iah</HI> and <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> tho&s;e ju&s;t men, who ruled in the fear of God; what ble&s;&s;ings they received, what deliverances were wrought for them and their people. Time would al&s;o fail, to &s;peak of <HI>Saul, Reoboam, Jeroboam, Ahab,
<PB N="15" REF="021401_0013_0FB3848473FBADA0">
Herod,</HI> and many other wicked rulers, and relate what judgments fell upon them and their people, for their unholy examples and wicked practices. Nothing but eternity can unfold to the view of an|gels and men, the happine&s;s of the one, and the mi&s;eries of the other.</P>
<P>But it is now time to clo&s;e this &s;ubject with &s;ome improvement.</P>
<P>And 1. We learn from whence rulers have their appointment; it is from God. Though they are &s;aid to be cho&s;en of men, yet they are ordained of God. This con&s;ideration gives great weight to their office. It is a &s;mall thing to be cho&s;en by men; but to be appointed by God, gives &s;uch honor and dignity to their appointment, that &s;atan him&s;elf dur&s;t not bring again&s;t them a railing accu&s;ation. How careful &s;hould rulers then be to obey and glorify God, who has thus honored and dignified them?</P>
<P N="2">2. We learn from what has been &s;aid, how great the work and bu&s;ine&s;s of rulers is. They are to &s;tand as pillars to &s;upport truth, which would other|wi&s;e fall in the &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s; and to &s;top tho&s;e innumera|ble &s;treams of wickedne&s;s which would otherwi&s;e over&s;pread the land, and bring on a deluge far more dreadful than that which de&s;troyed the old world. They are the &s;hields of the earth, which belong unto God. Though weak in them&s;elves, yet in God they are mighty: he is their refuge and &s;trength, a very pre&s;ent help in a time of trouble. Therefore they need not fear; he breaketh the bow, and cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|eth the &s;pear in &s;under; he burneth the chariots in the fire; the Lord of ho&s;ts is with them, the God of Jacob is their refuge; P&s;al. xl. 1, 9, 11.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="021401_0014_0FB384858D99E730">
Their work is great, as the liberty and property of thou&s;ands are committed to their care; in con&s;e|quence of which, they are reputed as fathers of the people. It is a great charge to &s;tand in the relation of a father to a &s;mall family; how much more to &s;tand in that relation to a whole nation? How un|natural for a father to &s;acrifice the intere&s;t and liberty of his children, and bring them into bond|age? How much more for rulers to &s;acrifice the intere&s;t and liberties of their &s;ubjects, and bring into bondage and di&s;tre&s;s that people, who confided in them, as their fathers, to defend and protect their rights? Rulers need be very careful: a little in|ju&s;tice, which does not &s;eem to affect the community now, may be as a leaven, which may break forth hereafter, and bring di&s;tre&s;s on many.</P>
<P N="3">3. We learn how much the good of generations to come depends upon the wi&s;e admini&s;trations, and pious examples, of civil rulers, who lay the foun|dation for future peace and glory. If our rulers, at this day, like <HI>David,</HI> &s;hould lay the foundations of this ri&s;ing empire, in the wi&s;dom and fear of God, we might expect the building would become exceed|ing magnificial of fame and of glory throughout all countries.

We learn the duty of &s;ubjects to their rulers, to treat them with all that re&s;pect and reverence, which their &s;tation requires, to encourage their hearts, and &s;trengthen their hands, by paying due regard to their ju&s;t and righteous laws. As we are favored with the privilege of choo&s;ing our rulers, we &s;hould highly prize the privilege, and always be ready to give in our voice agreeably to the advice which <HI>Jethro</HI> gave to Mo&s;es:&mdash;<HI>Choo&s;e ye out of all the people, able men, &s;uch as fear God; men of truth, hating covetou&s;ne&s;s</HI>&mdash;And after we have thus cho&s;en our ru|lers, we &s;hould receive the exhortation of the apo&s;tle, <HI>That fir&s;t of all, &s;upplications, prayers, interce&s;&s;ions, and giving of thanks be made for all men, for kings, and for all that are in authority,</HI> and then we may hope to <HI>lead peaceable and quiet lives, in all godline&s;s and hone&s;ty.</HI></P>

<P>HONORED SIR, Permit me to addre&s;s you with that re&s;pect and reverence which is due to one in your exalted &s;tation. You have been rai&s;ed up by the providence of God to pre&s;ide over the people of this &s;tate.&mdash;This day completes the round of &s;everal years, in which you have filled the chief &s;eat in the civil department. Many anxious cares, perplexing thoughts, and gloomy &s;cenes, have doubtle&s;s marked your various &s;teps; while reviving hopes, and gladning rays, have in&s;pired your brea&s;t with the mo&s;t plea&s;ing pro&s;pects, which have been like pillars to &s;upport you; and

ever will be a &s;ource of un&s;peakable joy and peace, if you are ju&s;t and rule in the fear of God. Great, yea, very great, is the tru&s;t which the people have committed to your charge! and very important are the labours which Heaven calls you to perform. On your wi&s;e and pious coun&s;els, ju&s;t and prudent mea&s;ures, depends, in &s;ome degree, the weal and tranquility of the people through this &s;tate. If you are wi&s;e and faithful, if you are ju&s;t and righteous, generations to come will ri&s;e up and call you ble&s;&s;ed. The cour&s;e of your admini&s;tration will &s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> be over; your &s;un has now pa&s;&s;ed the zenith, and de&s;cended far towards the we&s;tern hills: methinks I &s;ee your venerable head now clothed in grey: <HI>the almond tree be|gins to flouri&s;h, and tho&s;e which look out of the windows grow dim, and the &s;trong men begin to bow them&s;elves.</HI> You may &s;ay to the &s;urrounding multitude, as an ancient ruler in I&s;rael once &s;aid, I am this day going the way of all the earth; and it mu&s;t give you un|&s;peakable joy to &s;ee this infant &s;tate, which took its ri&s;e under your patronage, advancing from the dark &s;hades of ob&s;curity, into the fields of light and liberty.</P>
<P>Honored &s;ir, we wi&s;h you all the ble&s;&s;ings that time can be&s;tow! and when you are called to re&s;ign all by the bold demands of death, we wi&s;h a con|voy of angels to conduct you to higher courts, where you may hear the voice of your enthroned Redeemer, &s;aying, Come thou ble&s;&s;ed of my Father, thou ha&s;t been faithful in a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things; enter thou into the joy of my Lord!</P>

MUCH RESPECTED SIRS, The power and authority which you have over this people, render you worthy of their highe&s;t e&s;teem and regard; &s;ince to you is committed the care of that political &s;hip, in which our property, liberty, lives and earthly all are embarked. If you are ju&s;t and faithful, if you rule in the fear of God, we &s;hall ride &s;afe through all the winds and &s;torms which the kingdoms of this world can rai&s;e. Yea, the powers of hell cannot prevail again&s;t us, for then the Lord Jehovah will be on our &s;ide. But if you are unju&s;t, the &s;hip may over&s;et, and the whole car|go be lo&s;t: the people may fall a &s;acrifice to the rage and violence of tho&s;e men who&s;e tender mercies are cruel. However, we hope better things; we look up to you as the guardians and protectors of our rights and privileges, which we have maintained at the expen&s;e of a long war, in which we have &s;hed much blood, lo&s;t many lives, and expended va&s;t &s;ums of trea&s;ure; which we con&s;ider as &s;mall, com|pared to tho&s;e liberties which we now enjoy, and which we commit to your care, as to the care of wi&s;e and faithful men. This &s;tate is now beginning; the foundations of it are now laying; the wheels of government now begin to roll: and how much de|pends upon what is done in this early period, the good or evil effects of which will extend to genera|tions to come? The glory and felicity of this &s;tate in future time, depends upon your wi&s;e and prudent mea&s;ures. You may now provide for the &s;upport of &s;chools; you may do much for the &s;up|port of the go&s;pel, and for the good of the church; you are &s;et up for lights in the world, that you may

be eyes to the blind, feet to the lame; and that the ble&s;&s;ing of tho&s;e who are ready to peri&s;h, may de|&s;cend and re&s;t upon you. We look up to you as our leaders; if you are ju&s;t, and walk in the fear of God, and we do not follow you, our guilt will be upon our own heads, and you will deliver your own &s;ouls;&mdash;but, if your examples are unholy, and we follow you, our blood will be required at your hands. Chri&s;t pronounces the wo upon you; wo unto you Scribes and Phari&s;ees, for ye &s;hut up the kingdom of Heaven again&s;t men; for ye neither go in your|&s;elves, nor &s;uffer them that are entering to go in; Mat. xxiii. 13. As examples in rulers have a &s;ur|prizing influence upon &s;ubjects, we wi&s;h to &s;ee you ready to every good word and work! And what&s;o|ever things are true, what&s;oever things are hone&s;t, what&s;oever things are ju&s;t, what&s;oever things are pure, what&s;oever things are lovely, what&s;oever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, if there be any prai&s;e, think on the&s;e things; Phil. iv. 8. And may Chri&s;t, who will erelong call you to give an account of your &s;teward&s;hip, &s;ay unto you, Well done good and faithful &s;ervants, becau&s;e you have been faithful in a few things, I will make you rulers over many things, enter ye into the joy of your Lord.</P>
<P>The mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel de&s;erve our notice upon this occa&s;ion, and to whom I would now pay my re&s;pects.</P>
<P>Reverend Sirs, Permit me, as one of your brethren and compan|ions in the kingdom and patience of our Lord, to addre&s;s you in the &s;acred character of Amba&s;&s;adors for Je&s;us Chri&s;t. We are called to preach the ever|la&s;ting
<PB N="21" REF="021401_0019_0FB3848DCD32FF70">
go&s;pel of our divine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> the joyful news of pardon and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> the atoning merits of his blood. The field <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> entered into is extended far and wide;&mdash;the harve&s;t before us is great, and the labourers are few: therefore it is required of us, that we be found faithful, and attend to the duties of our &s;tation, as tho&s;e who mu&s;t give an account. Though we are not called to take any active part in the civil de|partment, yet we are to help them by our prayers and preaching; and while they u&s;e the weapons of their warfare, and draw the &s;word of civil ju&s;tice again&s;t open offenders, we are to u&s;e the weapons of our warfare, and proclaim the terrors of the Lord again&s;t the guilty &s;inner. Let us never grow faint nor weary in well doing, but be faithful until the death. The employment we have engaged in is noble and important: the rewards of tho&s;e who are faithful, are great and glorious; and the ma&s;ter whom we &s;erve, is no le&s;s than the King of kings, and Lord of lords, who will at la&s;t bring forth the many which &s;leep in the du&s;t; and they that are wi&s;e &s;hall &s;hine as the brightne&s;s of the firmament, and tho&s;e who have turned many to righteou&s;ne&s;s, as the &s;tars forever and ever.</P>
<P>I will now clo&s;e this di&s;cour&s;e with a word of ex|hortation to this whole a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>Permit me to remind you of the bonds of grati|tude we are under to God, for the &s;miles of his pro|vidence, which are this day upon us. We are not a&s;&s;embled in arms, to oppo&s;e an invading foe. Our ears are not a&s;&s;ailed with the alarms of war, nor our hearts &s;truck with fear and &s;urprize at the &s;ounding
<PB N="22" REF="021401_0020_0FB3848F4D579A88">
of trumpets and roaring of cannon. Our eyes do not &s;ee the garments of our brethren rolled in blood, nor their bodies wounded and torn with the cruel weapons of death; but we &s;ee our land in peace, and hear the voice of joy and gladne&s;s. We are called to choo&s;e our rulers, to make our laws, and govern our&s;elves, according to our wi&s;h and de&s;ire. O how different the &s;cene, and how much happier are our pro&s;pects, than they were a few years ago, when we were involved in all the horrors of war. This place was then the &s;eat of di&s;tre&s;s and confu&s;ion! How often did we hear the alarms of war, and bend our cour&s;e with ha&s;ty &s;peed to this and other places, to defend our hou&s;es and families, and all that was dear unto us, from the &s;word of our enemies, and from tho&s;e &s;avages who&s;e tender mercies are cruel!</P>
<P>How long did the important cau&s;e lie in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, when we &s;tood as fair to lo&s;e our all, as to win the day? But Heaven gave the deci&s;ion in our favour: our enemies were brought to &s;hame and confu&s;ion. Princes wandered in the wilderne&s;s unpitied &amp; for|lorn, and their hands were not able to perform their enterprize.</P>
<P>The Captain of our &s;alvation bowed the Heavens and come down; darkne&s;s was under his feet; he rode upon a cherub and did fly; yea he did fly up|on the wings of the wind; he brought &s;alvation to us in a very acceptable time&punc; and now we dwell in our hou&s;es, and there is none to make us afraid: we a&s;&s;emble for the purpo&s;e of e&s;tabli&s;hing govern|ment, &s;upporting peace, order, &amp; harmony, among us.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="021401_0021_0FB3849104441A20">
Such late and wonderful deliverances, which we have been made to experience, &s;hould lead our minds, when we are thus a&s;&s;embled, to that great and &s;olemn day, when the univer&s;e &s;hall be a&s;&s;em|bled before the Judge of all worlds; when the ju&s;t ruler, the faithful &s;ubject, the wi&s;e parent, the du|tiful child, and every pious Chri&s;tian, &s;hall obtain a complete victory over all their enemies; and a&s;|cend with a glorious triumph to their everla&s;ting abodes in the New Jeru&s;alem; be crowned with immortal honours, and reign as kings and prie&s;ts unto God and his Father forever. Then &s;hall the&s;e happy ones behold this world, which has been the &s;eat of confu&s;ion and di&s;cord, in her la&s;t convul&s;ions; the rocks rending, the mountains &amp; hills departing, the earth opening to her deep foundations, and con|tinents and oceans mingling together into their an|tient chaotic &s;tate;&mdash;while pillars of &s;moke, &amp; peals of thunder, and &s;treams of lightning, fill the teem|ing air, and cau&s;e the elements to melt with fervent hear. Then hell will enlarge her&s;elf, and open her mouth without mea&s;ure; and wicked kings, and unju&s;t rulers, with all their pomp and glory, &s;hall de&s;cend into it. Let this a&s;&s;embly remember, that this day is approaching, and not forget tho&s;e &s;olemn and eternal realities, while we are attending to the affairs of this world: but let tho&s;e who are &s;ub|jects, obey their rulers in the Lord, for this is right; and tho&s;e who rule, let them be ju&s;t, ruling in the fear of the Lord. Amen.</P>
