<HEAD>The Preface.</HEAD>
<P>_THERE are &s;undry Books on <HI>Hu&s;ban|dry</HI> wrote in <HI>ENGLAND:</HI> Having read all on that Subject I could ob|tain; yet &s;uch is the difference of Climate and method of Management between them and us, ari&s;ing from Cau&s;es that must make them always differ, &s;o that tho&s;e Books are not very U&s;eful to us. Be&s;ides this, the Terms of Art made u&s;e of are &s;o unknown to us, that a great deal they Write is quite unintelligible to the gene|rality of <HI>NEW-ENGLAND</HI> Readers.</P>
<P>Alth&ocirc; <HI>GREAT-BRITAIN</HI> in its Situation be above &s;ix Hundred Miles more Northerly than this Country, yet the Winters there are ordinarily &s;o Mild, that their Books direct to Ploughing in Lays all the Winter Months; whereas at that Sea&s;on we are commonly bound fast in Frost and Snow.</P>
<P>For the&s;e Rea&s;ons Books of <HI>Hu&s;bandry</HI> calcu|lated to the State and Circum&s;tances of the Coun|try may be of great Service; not an <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> of our Practice, not an <HI>Account</HI> of what we do in our pre&s;ent Hu&s;bandry, but rather <HI>what we might do,</HI> to our Advantage.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="006132_0004_1027F1489C0AD158">Having &s;pent more than Thirty Years in a Bu&s;ine&s;s that required a great deal of Travel, alth&ocirc; it did not much hinder Reading and Study, gave me an opportunity to &s;ee much of the Coun|try, of making many Ob&s;ervations, and of being acquainted with very many Per&s;ons of Worth &amp; Ingenuity, both Farmers and Others.</P>
<P>Yet all this while I was in a great mea&s;ure prevented hereby, from making Trials and Ex|periments of tho&s;e things which occurred to my Mind. Having had but One Years Lea&s;ure, am not &s;o well Furni&s;hed as the Readers may expect. If it doth no more, it may &s;erve to Excite tho&s;e who are more Sufficient and more Equal to the Bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;et on Foot what is &s;o much wanted.</P>
<P>It may be thought that a Subject of this Na|ture is not very &s;uitable for one of my Calling.</P>
<P>Certainly the Cultivation of the Earth affords the most u&s;eful Philo&s;ophy, opens to us a glorious &s;cene and di&s;covery of the Wi&s;dom and Power of the Creator and Governour of the World. It is what has imployed Men of all Rank and Or|ders, from the Prince to the Pea&s;ant.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, U&s;eful Knowlege has come from a Quarter from whence it was not &s;o natural to Expect it: A Monk first di&s;covered Gun-pow|der,
<PB N="iii" REF="006132_0005_1027F14A24899788">
and the u&s;eful Art of Printing was the In|vention of a Soldier.</P>
<P>It is acknowleged by our best Writers, That while other parts of Learning le&s;s u&s;eful, have been Cultivated, Agriculture or Hu&s;bandry, has been &s;trangly Neglected. Some &s;uppo&s;e the Rea|&s;on of this Neglect is, that the Subject is too low for Polite Writers. It was not &s;o accounted by King <HI>Solomon</HI>; He did not think it below his Dignity as a King, nor incon&s;i&s;tent with his Cha|racter as a Preacher. The Text &s;aith, <HI>For he &s;pake of the Trees, from the Cedar Tree that is in Lebanon, to the Hy&s;&s;op that &s;pringeth out of the Wall.</HI> This must include all u&s;eful Plants, Grain and Gra&s;s, even the whole Vegi|table Kingdom.</P>
<P>This u&s;eful Branch of Learning is Revived in <HI>Ireland,</HI> where &s;ome Hundreds of very con&s;idera|ble Per&s;ons in the Kingdom are A&s;&s;ociated to|gether to promote Hu&s;bandry and other Manu|factures, and are made a Chartered Corporation by the Government: Pens and Hands are &s;et to Work; it hath &s;et a new Face upon the Country, and the whole Kingdom feel the Advantage of this fine In&s;titution.</P>
<P>I rather think Hu&s;bandry has been Neglected as being too high; That is, Writers do not care
<PB N="iv" REF="006132_0006_1027F14CDAF05108">
to be at the trouble of Projecting, nor at the charge of Trials and Experiments upon what hath been Projected : It being a great deal ea&s;ier to write a Book upon the known Arts and Sciences that &s;hall be accepted and applauded, than to write upon Hu&s;bandry &s;o us not to be de&s;pi&s;ed; for &s;ome think we do not need it, and that we know all that can be known already.</P>
<P>If any think that I am mi&s;taken, I would de|&s;ire them to try; the <HI>Subject</HI> needs all the Help that can be afforded, E&s;pecially at a Time when there is &s;uch a heavy Load of Debt upon the Country.</P>
<P>If in this E&s;&s;ay, or any other way I may be &s;o happy as in the least degree to promote the Tem|poral or Spiritual Interest of my dear Friends and Country-men, it is what will afford me a &s;en&s;ible Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The plain Stile in which the following Pages are written, is what will render the whole the more Intelligible and U&s;eful to Farmers.</P>

<HEAD>An E&s;&s;ay upon Field-Husbandry in <HI>New-England.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_IT is not an Hundred and Thirty Years &s;ince the fir&s;t Settlement of <HI>New-England,</HI> and much le&s;s than that &s;ince the greater Part hath been Planted.</P>
<P>When we con&s;ider the &s;mall Number of the fir&s;t Setlers, and coming from an old Cultiva|ted Country, to thick Woods, rough unim|proved Lands; where all their former Expe|rience and Knowlege was now of very little Service to them: They were de&s;titute of Bea&s;ts of Burthen or Carriage; Un&s;kill'd in every part of Service to be done: It may be &s;aid, That in a &s;ort, <HI>they began the World a New.</HI></P>
<P>Their unacquaintedne&s;s with the Country, led them to make choice of the wor&s;t Land for their Improvement, and the mo&s;t expen&s;ive and chargeable Methods of Cultivation: They th&ocirc;t them&s;elves obliged to &s;tubb all Staddle, and cut down or lop all great Trees; in which they expended much Co&s;t and Time, to the
<PB N="2" REF="006132_0008_1027F1536850B978">
prejudice of the Crop and impoveri&s;hing the Land.</P>
<P>When we con&s;ider the&s;e things, the Progre&s;s that hath been made in &s;o &s;hort a Time is very wonderful.</P>
<P>There hath been great Improvements in <HI>Hu&s;bandry</HI> far and wide; be&s;ides various <HI>Trades</HI> and <HI>Manufactures,</HI> which are Yearly increa&s;ing.</P>
<P>Particularly,</P>
<P N="1">1. There are con&s;iderable Advances made in the <HI>Linen and Woolen Trades.</HI> There are many alive at this Day, who remember &s;ince the <HI>Linen</HI> was Coar&s;e, and what we call <HI>Tow Cloth</HI>; the other Cloth for <HI>outer Garments, Lin&s;y-Wool&s;y</HI>; and for &s;ome time was worn without Fulling or any kind of Dre&s;&s;ing: Af|ter they began to Full Cloth, for a time they u&s;ed neither Tentering or Pre&s;&s;ing; they only &s;tretched and wound the Cloth hard upon a &s;mooth log of Wood.</P>
<P N="2">2. We have Improved in <HI>the Iron-mongers Trade.</HI> In the early Times of the Country, the mo&s;t of the Iron made and in u&s;e, was <HI>Taunton</HI> Iron, made of Bog Oar, and &s;o coar&s;e and brittle as to break in the working, and when it was wrought, to the lo&s;s and vexation of the Smith and the Farmer.</P>
<P>This Metal, &s;uch as it was, was all the Iron then in u&s;e among us, except a little <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> &amp;
<PB N="3" REF="006132_0009_1027F156212B7C50">
<HI>Sweeds</HI> Iron for &s;ome &s;pecial U&s;es; &s;o that it is wonderful to think how that Generation did to Sub&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>After a while Bog Oar of a better &s;ort and of a more kindly nature &amp; temper was found, after that Mountain Oar was di&s;covered, which being melted &amp; refined makes excellent Iron.</P>
<P>We have further Improved upon it by con|verting it into <HI>Steel</HI>; which was entred upon without previous Skill, and wrought and beat out by frequent Experiments and by continued Practice.</P>
<P N="3">3. We have al&s;o Increa&s;ed in our <HI>Stocks of Cattel,</HI> and Improved our <HI>Breed of Hor&s;es.</HI> For &s;ome time after the Country was Setled, they had no Cattel at all; when &s;ome were brought over, what with the bad Hay they provided, it being cut upon Bog Meadow, the multitude of Wolves and other Bea&s;ts of Prey, for &s;undry Years they were kept &s;o low and had &s;o few Cattel, that the common Price for a grown Bullock was <HI>Twenty Pounds</HI> Ster|ling, which is Equal to <HI>Two Hundred Pounds</HI> Old Tenor.</P>
<P>I remember when I was a Boy, I heard a very ancient Woman of good Credit &s;ay, That &s;he had &s;een Twenty broad Pieces paid down for a Two Year old Heifer, which is now Equal to <HI>Two Hundred</HI> and <HI>Fifty Pounds</HI> Old Tenor.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="006132_0010_1027D968E1C38630">Although the Progre&s;s we have made be very Con&s;iderable, our Country yet needs and is capable of greater Improvement in the management of our Lands; of which I de&s;ign to con&s;ider in &s;everal Sorts.</P>
<P N="1">1. Tho&s;e <HI>Coves and Swamps</HI> that are ad|joining to Salt Mar&s;h, which ly &s;o flat and low that they cannot be Dreined: I have &s;een &s;undry &s;uch places upon the Sea Coa&s;t. I have &s;uch a piece of Ground, which I am obliged to Fence in, in order to inclo&s;e &s;ome other Land; which put me upon thought of trying to make &s;omething of it, it being now wholly unprofitable.</P>
<P>La&s;t Fall I began upon it and drew a Ditch of four Foot wide from a large Salt Creek, and carried it up in the middle of the Cove &s;eventy Rods, in order to turn it into Salt Meadow, that being the be&s;t that I could do with it: It &s;o far an&s;wers the de&s;ign, that the Tide flows regularly into it, to the upper end of it; the Tide now flowing, where I &s;uppo&s;e it never reach'd before. There mu&s;t be &s;mal|ler Ditches on each Side, to cut off the Fre&s;h Springs, and &s;mall Grips cut from the great Ditch in &s;undry places, that &s;o the Salt Water may be &s;pread and communicated to all parts of it.</P>
<P>The lower part next the Salt Mar&s;h is Ru&s;hes, the next are Reeds, then large Brakes
<PB N="5" REF="006132_0011_1027F15BCDA3CE58">
and Bu&s;hes, and la&s;t of all a thick Swamp. If this Land can be converted into Salt Meadow, it will be much cheaper than to Purcha&s;e &s;o much Salt Mar&s;h, and will lie very convenient to my other Land.</P>
<P>Salt Water will effectually kill Trees and Bu&s;hes where it comes, both Root and Branch.</P>
<P N="2">2. The &s;econd &s;ort of Land that I &s;hall con|&s;ider, is, the <HI>low &s;unken Lands,</HI> which have no Communication with Salt Mar&s;h: Of this &s;ort there are three Kinds, viz. <HI>Thick Swamps, Boggy Meadow,</HI> and <HI>&s;mooth, even, &s;haking Meadow</HI>; this la&s;t &s;ort is called <HI>Cramberry Mar&s;h:</HI> He that would do any thing to Effect with either of the&s;e Sorts, mu&s;t in the fir&s;t place &s;ee whe|ther there be deep Mire; if it be &s;hallow and &s;oon come to hard Sand, Clay or Gravel, it will be not worth while to expend Co&s;t upon it.</P>
<P>Again, You mu&s;t examine what Fall there is. If the Fall be apparent to the Eye, and this for ten or fifteen Rods, you may be &s;atis|fied; if you are uncertain, try it with a water Level or &s;pirit Level: If your Mar&s;h be &s;mall, the Drein long, rocky and likely to be charge|able, it may be be&s;t to let it alone; but if it be a large Swamp or Meadow, alth&ocirc; the main Drein &s;hould be a con&s;iderable Charge, that &s;hould be no di&s;couragement.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="006132_0012_1027F15E74C4D1D0">That low Ground which is thick with Wood and Bru&s;h, will be the mo&s;t Chargeable; the Bog Meadow the next in Charge, becau&s;e the Bogs mu&s;t be cut up with a Bog Plough or with the Hoe; either way is Chargeable: The &s;haking Meadow has the be&s;t Surface, and is ea&s;ie&s;t to bring to Mowing.</P>
<P>La&s;t <HI>August</HI> was Twelve Month I began to Drein a Pond that lies but a Mile from my Hou&s;e; it was not a natural Pond, but made &s;o upon de&s;ign. Our Record informs that it was granted to a Man to prevent the miring of Cattel; the Owner of it laid it under Water about Eighty Years ago: It was overgrown with Pond Lilly's; it was thought by mo&s;t that to Drein it was impractible: Some &s;aid, That it was as unlikely as to Drein the Ocean. At the outlet there &s;eemed to be little or no Fall; but trying it with a Level, my Son and I found that in forty Rod there was Fall &s;uffi|cient: We therefore &s;et about Dreining it, have &s;ucceeded &s;o far that it bids fair to make a good piece of Land. It had been under Water &s;o long, and was &s;o full of Pond Lilly-Roots, that when the Water was drawn off and the Lilly-Roots dried and &s;hrunk up, it grew to be Puffy, &amp; did not for this Rea&s;on do &s;o well as we expected: The Gra&s;s Seed did not come up well, nor &s;tand &s;o well as in Land that has lain open to the heat of the Sun.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="006132_0013_1027F16121834110">The whole Pond was about Twenty Acres, and the Soyl is eight or ten Foot deep: There are in it many large Springs, which are fifteen Foot deep.</P>
<P>I began la&s;t <HI>March</HI> to Drein another Mea|dow of Forty Acres, up in <HI>Guilford</HI> Woods; this was a &s;haking Meadow; A Man &s;tanding upon it might &s;hake the Ground &s;everal Rods round him. It &s;eemed to be only a &s;trong &s;word of Gra&s;s Roots laid over a &s;oft Mud of the con&s;i&s;tence of Pan-cake Batter: There was not abundance of Bu&s;hes in it, but abun|dance of Cramberry Vines, and a great burthen of poor wild Gra&s;s: The Meadow was deem'd &s;o poor that none would take it up. I was pitied as being about to wa&s;t a great deal of Money; but they comforted them&s;elves that if I &s;pent it unprofitably, others that &s;tood in need of it would get it: They are now of another opinion.</P>
<P>At the only Out-let of this Meadow there was Fall &s;ufficient, but very Rocky; we mu&s;t dig four or five Foot deep to get the Advan|tage of it.</P>
<P>In <HI>March</HI> when I went up to make the Out|let Drein, there was &s;uch a torrent of Water that we could do nothing; I ordered there|fore a Tree to be cut down a-cro&s;s the Brook, and prepared Flitches in&s;tead of Plank, which we &s;et a&s;lant, the upper end re&s;ting upon the
<PB N="8" REF="006132_0014_1027F162AA5E5BF8">
Staddle that was fallen cro&s;s the Brook, laid them as clo&s;e as we could, and &s;topped the Chinks and large Ca&s;ms with top Tow, by which means we &s;hut the Water into the Mea|dow, then wr&ocirc;t at the Trench or main Drein in the Day &amp; let it out at Night, till it was in a good mea&s;ure accompli&s;hed. When I ordered the top Tow to be carried, the Men wondred what it was de&s;igned for, but when they &s;aw how u&s;eful it was in making a cheap Dam they were plea&s;ed with it. I put them in mind of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Proverb, who &s;ay of things that are very mean, <HI>That &s;omthing is always good for &s;omthing.</HI></P>
<P>When the Weather grew &s;ufficiently warm and the Meadow a little &s;etled, we began to Ditch. I cut a Ditch on each &s;ide and one in the middle: As far as we went it &s;oon rendred the Meadow firm and dry: I then proceeded to &s;ow Gra&s;s-Seed, &s;uch as red Clover, &s;oul Meadow Gra&s;s, <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Spear Gra&s;s, and Herd Gra&s;s: Of all the &s;orts of Gra&s;s Seed I &s;owed, none &s;eemed to take hold and come up &s;o well as red Clover; this I found to be the bolde&s;t and mo&s;t hardy Gra&s;s.</P>
<P>Where the Sword was &s;trong, alth&ocirc; the Clo|ver came up well, yet what with the toughne&s;s of the Ground and the over-topping growth of the wild natural Gra&s;s, the Clover made but &s;low progre&s;s till the Fall of the Year, and then
<PB N="9" REF="006132_0015_1027F1655A86A640">
it mended con&s;iderably. But where there happened to be no Sword to hinder it, the Clo|ver grew up to the height of mid Thigh, went to Seed and the Seed was ripe.</P>
<P>Of the other &s;orts of Gra&s;s came up but poorly: The Land I &s;uppo&s;e was too new and too tough for it.</P>
<P>Some time in <HI>September</HI> I Ploughed up a piece of it where I had not Sowed any Gra&s;s Seed, it Ploughed very tough and the Cattel mired &s;ome, but we kept them upon the Gra&s;s as well as we could; after all we left many Baulks: About a Month after I &s;et &s;ome Men to Hoe up the Baulks, and was agreeably &s;ur|prized to find how ea&s;ie it Hoed up. I find the Meadow rotted and mellowed more in one Month in the Fall than it had done in the whole Summer: The &s;ame I found by the Ditch Banks. If I had omitted my Ploughing till a Month later, it had been done with much more ea&s;e to Man and Bea&s;t.</P>
<P>In <HI>July</HI> I &s;owed a little piece of Turneps, they came up, but never grew till the Ground began to rot in the Fall of the Year, then grew well in the &s;hort time they had left: I expected they would have been Rank, but they were good and &s;weet.</P>
<P>Some are deterred from &s;uch an undertaking as that of Dreining their Land, by rea&s;on of the great Charge: They terrify them&s;elves without
<PB N="10" REF="006132_0016_1027F16809FADAF8">
Rea&s;on. When I was about to cut my main Drein, &s;ome thought it impo&s;&s;ible, but at be&s;t it would co&s;t an <HI>Hundred Pounds</HI>: It was a bad place of Rocks; &s;ome I dug up, &s;ome we broke up with Steel Wedges, and &s;ome we blew up with Powder: But after all it did not co&s;t more than <HI>Twenty Pounds.</HI></P>
<P>As to the great Charge of Ditching, they do not con&s;ider that the out&s;ide Ditches &s;erve for Fence, as well as to cut off the Springs and drein the Meadow, and it is as cheap Fence as any we can make; &s;o that there is none but the middle or intermediate Ditches, that are properly to be con&s;idered as a Charge in Dreining.</P>
<P>Some may think this long Hy&s;tory of two pieces of Meadow, this tedious Detail of &s;o many minute Particulars to be needle&s;s, trifling and impertinent.</P>
<P>I have been particular in de&s;cribing the main or out-let Drein of each Meadow, that it may be &s;een that the difficulty of Rocks is not in&s;u|perable, nor the charge of a long Drein into|lerable.</P>
<P>I mentioned the cheap movable Dam, which may be made in a few Hours, that if they &s;hould be incumbred with Water to hinder their work, there is a Remedy at hand.</P>
<P>I informed you of the growth of one of the Meadows, that it was Mo&s;s and Pond Lillies,
<PB N="11" REF="006132_0017_1027F16BE887B3B0">
which will &s;oon die when the Water is gone: The Mo&s;s creates the mo&s;t trouble, but will burn when it is a dry Sea&s;on.</P>
<P>I gave an account of the depth of the Soyl, becau&s;e I was when I began uncertain whether by Ditches three Foot wide and two and half deep (&s;uch as mine are) would be &s;ufficient to fix the &s;haking Meadow, and render the deep Mire firm and dry enough for Gra&s;s and Tillage. I think there is rea&s;on to believe that the &s;haking Meadows have been formerly Bever Ponds.</P>
<P>I de&s;cribed the extent and bigne&s;s of each Meadow, becau&s;e I was uncertain whether the Ditches would draught well when they were very long.</P>
<P>Some of mine are an hundred and fifty Rods long, and mu&s;t be yet much longer; yet as far as we have gone they draw well. In order to have them draw well and run free, it is ab&s;o|lutely needful, and a main point, to have your out-let Drein deep, &s;o that the water run bri&s;kly.</P>
<P>If the Ditches draw well there is another Ad|vantage; in the Spring when there is much Water, by &s;topping one Ditch you may &s;hift the Water into another to clean&s;e it, and &s;o to a third: Hereby you will &s;ave the charge of the Yearly Scouring of them with the Shovel, which is a good &s;aving: I find by Experience I have that Advantage.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="006132_0018_1027F16E959540D8">I have in&s;i&s;ted the longer upon this Article, it being an affair of Importance: If it &s;hould an&s;wer our Expectation, it will put us into the Improvement of Land of which as yet we have had no Benefit; nay, it has been rather hurt|ful. It opens to us a new Scene, and Time may po&s;&s;ibly di&s;cover it to be the ea&s;ie&s;t of Tillage, the riche&s;t and be&s;t Land,</P>
<P>By the working of my own Mind I judge of others; however if I have been mi&s;taken, and that which is uncertain to me, is clear &amp; ea&s;ie to others, and &s;o have been longer upon this Particular than is needful or u&s;eful, I beg par|don of the Reader.</P>
<P>When I ingaged in this Affair, it was with &s;ome di&s;tru&s;t and uncertainty: I am &s;ure la&s;t Year I &s;hould have been glad of &s;uch an Hy&s;tory of Facts (as imperfect as it is) it would have afforded me Light, Courage and In&s;truction.</P>
<P>As to what remains farther to be done, I &s;hould be glad to meet with an experienced Per&s;on to give me Directions. Our Rea&s;onings and Speculations without Experience are de|lu&s;ory and uncertain. It u&s;ed to be the Say|ing of an old Man, <HI>That an Ounce of Experience is better than a Pound of Science.</HI></P>
<P>In a Country where &s;uch like Dreining is become a common Practice, &s;uch an account as I have given would be needle&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="006132_0019_1027F17020BF3978">I find by Experience, that &s;uch dreined Land mu&s;t have one Summer to ferment and rot, &s;o as to become proper Soyl, before it will be fit for Grain and every &s;ort of Gra&s;s. If I had &s;owed red Clover in&s;tead of the other &s;orts of Gra&s;s, I had &s;aved five Pound in Seed. Clo|ver out-did my Expectation, and the other &s;orts fell &s;hort of it: If others &s;ave where I lo&s;t, and mend wherein I was mi&s;taken, it an&s;wers my de&s;ign in Writing.</P>
<P>By a little Experience we have had of the&s;e dreined Lands, we find they will produce <HI>In|dian</HI> Corn, &s;ixty or &s;eventy Bu&s;hels to the Acre, and Flax. If Life &amp; Health be continued, I de&s;ign to try Liquorice Roots, Barley, <HI>Cape-Breton</HI> Wheat, Cotton, Indigo Seed, &amp; Wood for dying, which I have &s;ent for, as al&s;o water Melon Seed, which came originally from <HI>Arch Angel</HI> in <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> which is &s;aid produces Melons which grow to a great Size. But what I have principally in view is Hemp. <HI>New-England</HI> doth not, I &s;uppo&s;e, Expend le&s;s than &s;everal <HI>Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds</HI> worth of Forein Hemp Yearly. If we can rai&s;e more than to &s;upply our own Occa&s;ions, we may &s;end it Home. I remember when I was Young, a Gentleman came from <HI>England,</HI> &s;ent over by the King, to invite the Country into that Trade; he offered in the King's Name to find Seed to begin with, and <HI>Four-pence</HI> Sterling <HI>per</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="006132_0020_1027F17432A9F498">
Pound, let us Rai&s;e what we would (which is <HI>Three</HI> and <HI>Four-pence</HI> Old Tenor,) and if I remember right, <HI>Forty Shillings</HI> Bounty on every Ton.</P>
<P><HI>England</HI> is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the Woolen Trade, and <HI>Ireland</HI> of the Linen Trade; &s;o that this Hemp Trade lies open to us, which may in time become our Staple for Returns Home; and &s;o bring the Balance of Trade to be in our Favour, which has always as yet been again&s;t us.</P>
<P>A Staple Commodity is of great Importance to a Country: Such is the Woolen Manu|facture to <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> the Linen Trade to <HI>Ireland,</HI> Tobacco to <HI>Virginia,</HI> Rice to <HI>Carolina,</HI> and Sugars to our <HI>West-India</HI> I&s;lands. The Herring Trade is of &s;uch Importance to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> that the Emperor <HI>Charles the Fifth</HI> coming into the Low Country's with the Queen of <HI>Hungaria,</HI> made a Journey to <HI>Bier Ulict,</HI> on purpo&s;e to &s;ee the Tomb of <HI>William Buckel&s;z,</HI> who fir&s;t found out the method of Curing and Barrelling of Herring Fi&s;h. That great Prince and States Man, in paying &s;uch Regard to the Memory of that u&s;eful Man, thereby te&s;tified the Value he &s;et upon that bene|ficial &amp; exten&s;ive Trade, which is &s;aid to be worth <HI>Two Millions</HI> in a Year to the <HI>Dutch.</HI></P>
<P>It is not a meer Conjecture that the dreined Lands will produce Hemp. I am informed
<PB N="15" REF="006132_0021_1027F176E833C750">
by my worthy Friend <HI>Benjamin Franklin</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> that they Rai&s;e Hemp upon their dreined Lands.</P>
<P>Hemp requires &s;uch very &s;trong Land to produce it, that it would con&s;ume all our Dung to Rai&s;e it in any great Quantities; &s;o that we &s;hould not be able to rai&s;e Bread Corn: There|fore how Inviting fo ever the Trade is, and how great &s;o ever the Encouragements have been, both from Home and by our own Go|vernments, we have not as yet engaged in that Affair: We have now a promi&s;ing Pro&s;pect of Succe&s;s in the&s;e dreined Lands; what may be the I&s;&s;ue, Time and Experience mu&s;t de|termine.</P>
<P>The Books of Hu&s;bandry &s;ay, <HI>That a Thou|&s;and Weight to the Acre is an ordinary Crop of Hemp.</HI></P>
<P>If a Man had a &s;mall Meadow of Dreined Land, that he could lay under Water and draw it off at his plea&s;ure to Water his Hemp, it would, I fancy, be of great Value. I have heard that a Man in the <HI>Jer&s;ies,</HI> hath &s;uch a Meadow of half an Acre, which yields him as much Hemp Yearly, as fetches him <HI>Fifty Pounds York</HI> Money; but this &s;eems incredi|ble.</P>
<P>Some think that it is good to lay their low Lands under Water in the Winter to inrich them, and practi&s;e accordingly: But this will
<PB N="16" REF="006132_0022_1027F178700DD588">
kill your <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gra&s;s after a few Years: For <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gra&s;s will not &s;ub&s;i&s;t without a Winter. In the <HI>Southern</HI> Colonies the le&s;s Winter the le&s;s Gra&s;s. In <HI>Virginia, North</HI> &amp; <HI>South Caroli|na,</HI> they have no <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gra&s;s at all. Where there is no <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gra&s;s, it is difficult to make Cattel truly fat; &s;o that Winter brings its good as well as its evil Things.</P>
<P N="3">3. The third &s;ort of Land I would &s;peak of is <HI>our old Land which we have worn out.</HI> This is a difficult Article without Dung, which can|not be had for Love nor Money: Where that is wanting, it may be &s;upplied with other Ma|nure. Clay will mend Sandy Land, e&s;pecially if the Clay be burnt; and Sand will mend Clay Ground: The Clay will fix the too loo&s;e con|texture of the Sand, and Sand will open the parts of Clay which is too clo&s;e.</P>
<P>I found at my Farm at <HI>Guilford,</HI> a &s;ort of Shell Sand, try'd it and found it equal to good Dung: Some that I ordered to be carried up on the Tilled Land, has produced five Crops, and is not yet &s;pent; how long it will la&s;t we do not know: They begin to carry it up into the Town.</P>
<P>I have carted this Fall upon my Land at home &s;ome loads of Creek Mud, that had been laid up a rotting two Years: I al&s;o carted home one load from the dreined Pond; it looks like Dung: Al&s;o one load of Clay, one load of
<PB N="17" REF="006132_0023_1027F17B1E92FB08">
Sand, and a load of Loam: What all or any of the&s;e will do, Experience mu&s;t inform.</P>
<P>Another way to help Worn-out Land is to &s;ow it with Clover Seed; but if the Land be too poor it will not grow: Therefore if we can rai&s;e our <HI>Indian</HI> Corn upon our Dreined Land, then we may &s;pare a &s;prinkling of Dung for our old poor Land: Then &s;ow it with ten Pound of Clover Seed, which is five Quarts to the Acre; it might cau&s;e it to &s;et very thick. Ten Pounds is not too much. He that rai&s;eth Clover Hay, need not be afraid of the expence of Seed; for an Acre of Clover will yield Two Bu&s;hels of clean Seed: The &s;econd Crop of Clover is the be&s;t for Seed: So that in getting Seed, you have no need to &s;poil your be&s;t Crop of Hay; as we know what Thre&s;hing will do, it &s;poils the Hay in a great mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>If you depend upon the &s;econd Crop of red Clover for your Seed, the Land mu&s;t be very rich, and you mu&s;t Mow your fir&s;t Crop early. There is &s;o much profit in Clover Gra&s;s, that it is &s;trange it is &s;o much neglected. As Seed &s;ells now, that is <HI>Twelve Shillings</HI> a Quart, an Acre of good Clover will make <HI>Thirty Five Pounds,</HI> Old Tenor. There is no charge a|bout it but only the Price of the Seed,: Mow|ing &amp; Clean&s;ing the Seed, which is done with a great deal of ea&s;e, in a way that de&s;erves to be made Publick.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="006132_0024_1027F17F3894F470">If Seeding the Land with Clover will not make poor Land rich, yet it would prevent our better Land from being worn out; and by ploughing in a good Coat of white Clover, the Land would be prepared for a Crop of Wheat.</P>
<P>Seeding the Land when we lay it down is of &s;o much importance for pre&s;ent Profit &amp; future Advantage, that it is a &s;etled Opinion at the <HI>I&s;le of Wight, That if they &s;hould fail but one Year to Seed their Land for Gra&s;s, it would be to their damage more than</HI> Twenty Thou&s;and Pounds <HI>Sterling.</HI></P>
<P>Another way of mending poor Land, is, by Feeding it clo&s;e a few Years with Sheep, to de|&s;troy the Briars, Weeds &amp; mangy Gra&s;s: This hath &s;ucceeded to bring in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gra&s;s and make a &s;trong Sword.</P>
<P>It will be be&s;t to take out the Sheep at the latter end of <HI>August,</HI> that &s;o what <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gra&s;s there is, may make coat for the Ground before Winter, and then &s;hut it up that it may not be Fed: By the end of <HI>August</HI> the wild Tra&s;h has done growing.</P>
<P>In <HI>England,</HI> to recover their poor Land, they direct to &s;ow their Land with Turneps, and at Winter put their Sheep upon it; and they will live a while upon the Tops and then &s;coop out the Turneps it &s;elf; by that time the Land with the Sheep Dung will be rich enough for Barley in the Spring: But our poor Land is
<PB N="19" REF="006132_0025_1027F181E646B0D8">
&s;o poor that it will not bear Turneps bigger than Buttons. This method looks likely, if tried, to make rich Land richer.</P>
<P>Some propo&s;e to &s;ow Oats and when grown up Plough them in.</P>
<P N="4">4. I de&s;igned to write &s;omthing concerning <HI>our poor, rough, &s;tony, uneven Land in the Woods,</HI> which is now of little Service to us: I would propo&s;e a way how it might be Improved &s;o as to become u&s;eful and profitable Land, which I propo&s;ed to &s;ubmit to the Readers better Judgment: But finding that I have already gone a greater Length than I at fir&s;t de&s;igned, it mu&s;t be omitted.</P>
<P>A better <HI>Breed of Sheep</HI> is what we want. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Breed of <HI>Cots-wold Sheep</HI> cannot be obtained, or at lea&s;t without great difficulty: For Wool and live Sheep are contra-band Goods, which all Strangers are prohibited from carrying out, on pain of having their right Hand cut off.</P>
<P>I have one Ram which is of a good Breed, in part, has had no better Keeping than our or|dinary Sheep (I was of the mind to &s;ee what he would do with mean Keeping) notwith|&s;tanding his poor Keeping two Years, he is very large &amp; long, has fine Wool, and la&s;t Shearing time afforded a Fleece of &s;ix Pounds.</P>
<P>As the mixture of this Breed with our ordi|nary Sheep &s;ucce&s;&s;ively will run the Breed
<PB N="20" REF="006132_0026_1027F1836F854498">
quite out, &s;o putting the &s;ame Breed together, as they approach nearer to the Original, the true Breed may be recovered.</P>
<P>A <HI>Barrel of Cyder of &s;weet Apples</HI> when made into Mela&s;&s;es, will be worth <HI>Three Pounds,</HI> abating <HI>Five Shillings</HI> for the Making, when Cyder made of common Apples, a Barrel will be worth but <HI>Twenty Shillings,</HI> exclu&s;ive of the Barrel.</P>
<P>I have been told <HI>that half a Peck of the little round white Beans mix'd with a Bu&s;hel of Rye,</HI> will make Bread &s;omthing like Wheat; I have never try'd it, but de&s;ign to &s;ee what it will do.</P>
<P>I have been told <HI>that Summer Wheat &s;owed with Barley</HI> is not apt to Bla&s;t, and do well together; al&s;o <HI>Summer Rye and Oats</HI>: As al&s;o <HI>Oats and Peas</HI> produce a good Crop when &s;owed together; the Oats bearing up the Pea Vines prevent their falling to the Ground.</P>
<P>I find by Experience the be&s;t time <HI>to Fatten Swine,</HI> is to begin at the fir&s;t of <HI>August,</HI> if you have old Corn: Hogs will fat &s;lowly in very cold Weather: they will eat much and fatten but little: If you make a very warm Hou&s;e, they heat in Bed and catch cold when they come out into the cold Air.</P>
<P>To <HI>&s;ave Corn,</HI> &s;teep it in Water or Swill till the Corn grow very &s;oft; this opens the parts: Give them the Corn to eat and the Water to
<PB N="21" REF="006132_0027_1027F2EEC2861670">
drink in which the Corn has been Steeped: The hard dry Corn, a great deal of it, pa&s;&s;eth through them undige&s;ted; this is the harde&s;t part of the Corn and that which principally makes the Flower. There is a Tradition, that if you feed one Hog with Corn, the Dung of the fir&s;t Hog will fat another Hog, and his Dung a third. Alth&ocirc; I believe the Story to be Fabulous, yet it &s;erves to &s;hew that the &s;en&s;e of Mankind, is, that in the manner we feed Swine, there is a great deal of Lo&s;s.</P>
<P>I took the hint of &s;teeping Corn, from the advantage I once found by &s;ome Corn I bought that had been Ship-wreck'd, had lain in the Water till it was grown &s;oft.</P>
<P>Such is the difference in Corn and in Swine, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to fix it ab&s;olutely and know certainly how much there is &s;aved by this method. It is better than Grinding, be|&s;ides what we &s;ave in the Toll and the time &amp; charge of the Carriage: For it is found by Experience, that even Bran when &s;teeped in Water a long time, is much the better.</P>
<P>I a&s;ked an hone&s;t judicious Neighbour of mine, who had lea&s;ure to try this Method of &s;teeping Corn longer &amp; with more exactne&s;s than I had done, <HI>How much he thought was &s;aved by it?</HI> He &s;aid, <HI>At least one Bu&s;hel in &s;even</HI>; he believed more: But we will &s;uppo&s;e it &s;ave but a Tenth part, then &s;ee how much it
<PB N="22" REF="006132_0028_1027F184F92499E0">
will &s;ave in the whole Colony? Suppo&s;e there are in this Colony, about Sixty Towns, great and &s;mall, new &amp; old: We will &s;uppo&s;e Two Hundred Families in each Town, one with an|other, and each Family to con&s;ume or &s;pend as much Pork as will require one with another Twenty Bu&s;hels of Corn to make the Pork for each Family. Sixty Towns of Two Hundred Families each, makes Twelve Thou&s;and Fa|milies, and Twenty Bu&s;hels of Corn to each Family makes Two Hundred Forty Thou&s;and Bu&s;hels of Corn: The Tenth part of this is <HI>Twenty Four Thou&s;and Bu&s;hels.</HI> If there be not &s;o many Towns and Families as is &s;uppo&s;ed, there is much Pork fatted and &s;ent away in Barrels, and many Herds of fat Swine drove away that are not con&s;umed in the Govern|ment, enough to make it up: And &s;urely the &s;aving <HI>Twenty Four Thou&s;and Bu&s;hels of Corn Yearly,</HI> is worthy of our Care and Con&s;idera|tion.</P>
<P>Since the foregoing was Written, a Per&s;on of good Credit informed me, That there being in his Neighbourhood a dealer in Hor&s;es, who was famous for &s;kill in making Hor&s;es fat in a &s;hort Time; he de&s;ired the Jockey to tell him how he did it: The &s;ecret was to mix <HI>Indian</HI> Corn &amp; Oats together and &s;oak it in Water till it was &s;oft; that in cold weather he &s;teeped it in a Cellar that it might be kept from freezing.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="006132_0029_1027F18696390E70">My Informer told me, he had made tryal of it and found it did well, giving it to his Hor&s;e in the &s;ame proportion as he was wont to do of dry Provender.</P>
<P>An hand full of dry A&s;hes put upon each hill of <HI>Indian</HI> Corn, in &s;ome Land, has been found to do good equal to Dunging in the hole: Some &s;ay there ought to be half a pint of A&s;hes to each Hill, and it &s;hould be put on a little after the Corn is come up.</P>
<P>I was told by an experienc'd Farmer, that if you girdle Trees, or cut Bru&s;h in the Months of <HI>May, June</HI> &amp; <HI>July,</HI> in the Old of the Moon, that day the Sign removes out of the Foot into the Head, e&s;pecially if the Day be Cloudy, it will kill almo&s;t all before it: They will bleed, he &s;aid, more freely in a cloudy Day; for the hot Sun dries up the Sap. I have never tryed it. If this could be certainly found out, it would Expedite the clearing Land and &s;ave a great deal of Labour: But Experience is Au|thority, to whom we are to &s;ubmit, I am not forward to believe without Trial.</P>
<P>Swamps that are full of Wood and Bru&s;h and covered with Mo&s;s, if they are deep Soil and can be well Dreined, Cleared &amp; Ditched, will make good Land for Corn &amp; Gra&s;s.</P>
<P>Elder Bu&s;hes are &s;tubborn and hard to Sub|due, yet I know by Experience that Mowing them five times in a Year will kill them.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="006132_0030_1027F18DF60FC860">It might &s;erve to increa&s;e <HI>u&s;eful Knowlege,</HI> if &s;omthing of this Nature were Publi&s;hed every Year, giving a faithful account of the Succe&s;s of all the Experiments &amp; Trials that may be made on various &s;orts of Land, and of divers &s;orts of Grains, Roots, Gra&s;s &amp; Fruits, not only &s;uch as we have in u&s;e, as al&s;o what we have not as yet introduced among us.</P>
<P>There are few Men of Bu&s;ine&s;s, Ingenuity &amp; Ob&s;ervation, but what have found out things Valuable &amp; U&s;eful, but for want of &s;ome pro|per Method to communicate them, they die with the Di&s;coverers &amp; are lo&s;t to mankind.</P>

<P>THere are &s;ome pieces of Pa&s;ture Land wholly de&s;titute of Water, which ren|ders them le&s;s U&s;eful and Valuable. It is known that frequently Springs are nearer the Surface on Hills, than in Plains: Therefore to Remedy this Inconvenience, dig a Well on the brow of an Hill: When you come to Water, Stone it over, or Stone it up; then dig a Trench in the &s;ide of the Hill to reach the bot|tom of the Well: Stone up your Trench and cover it over with Earth; or a Trough may an&s;wer the End when buried in the Ground. Where the Water i&s;&s;ues out, there dig a Watering-place.</P>
<P>Since the fore-going Pages were written, I have made trial of Ditching in Swamp Land when the Ground was frozen Two Inches deep: It is performed with a broad Ax having a long Helve, with which we cut the Ground, Roots of Brakes and Bu&s;hes, with &s;peed and &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t have an Iron Hook with two or three Teeth &s;et in a Handle, to draw out the Sodds when they are cut.</P>
<P><PB REF="006132_0033_1027F192ACA64470">The Labourer works clean and dry: You cannot conveniently make the Ditch quite half the proper depth; the re&s;t mu&s;t be left till Summer to be fini&s;hed. If we could do half our Ditching in the Winter it would be a good &s;aving.</P>
<P>Under the Article of ways to mend old worn|out Land, by &s;owing it with red Clover, &s;ome may wonder to find it there &s;aid, that five quarts was a proper proportion of Seed, when it hath been found by Experience that Two Quarts to the Acre will produce a good Burthen: It is true; but you will find when the Crop is carried off, that the Roots will be at a great Di&s;tance from each other; nor will the&s;e void Spaces fill up till the Clover is run out its Pe|riod: Whereas it would quit co&s;t in Feed and after Crops, to Seed &s;o much that the Gra&s;s may &s;et thick. It was not propo&s;ed to u&s;e &s;o much Seed to the Acre, till in the common Method we have a plenty of Seed.</P>
<P>What is here written is but a Foundation laid for a future &amp; more agreeable Super&s;tructure. Having prepared a &s;ort of Land that has been but little in U&s;e among us, I propo&s;e to have a new &s;ort of Improvement.</P>
