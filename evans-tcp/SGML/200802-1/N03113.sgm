<P>WE have no particular account of the <HI>bigne&s;s</HI> of this City It was probably of but &s;mall extent: Yet was it &s;eated in the mid&s;t of a large, fine and fertile country, from whence they &s;upply'd them&s;elves with all manner of provi&s;ions. The <HI>&s;pies</HI> &s;ent forth

from the <HI>tribe of Dan to &s;earch the land,</HI> do therefore unite in that Report about it, v. 9. &mdash; <HI>We have &s;een the land, and behold, it is very good.</HI> V. 10. <HI>When ye go, ye &s;hall come &mdash; to a large land: &mdash; a place where there is no want of any thing in the earth.</HI> &mdash; But I will not detain you too long upon what is le&s;s pertinent to the de&s;ign I have in view. Wherefore,</P>
<P N="2">II. WE may now con&s;ider the <HI>character</HI> here given of the <HI>inha|bitants of</HI> LAISH. <HI>And they came to</HI> LAISH, <HI>unto a people</HI> that were AT QUIET AND SECURE. We have much the &s;ame account in v. 7. <HI>They dwelt</HI> CARELESS, &mdash; QUIET AND SECURE. That is to &s;ay, they did not perplex their minds with concern about their enemies; had no &s;en&s;e of danger; were tho't le&s;s of a &s;urpri&s;e, and without expectation of any &s;udden a&s;&s;ault. Being at peace with their neighbours, and having been &s;o, perhaps a long time, they had &s;ettled into habitual &s;ecurity, dwelt without fear, and knew no unea&s;ine&s;s from an apprehen&s;ion of being liable to be de&s;troy'd.</P>
<P>AND as the effect of this carele&s;s temper, they were &s;hamefully negligent of their own &s;afety; had taken no care to keep up a <HI>martial &s;pirit,</HI> or encourage a knowledge in the <HI>art of war.</HI> Pro|bably they had no <HI>di&s;ciplin'd &s;ouldiers</HI>; none us'd to <HI>military exerci&s;es</HI>; none acquainted with the management of the <HI>&s;pear,</HI> the <HI>&s;word</HI> or <HI>bow</HI>; or that had either skill or courage to <HI>&s;peak with the enemy in the gate.</HI> Or if they were ever &s;o <HI>expert</HI> and <HI>valiant,</HI> it was to little purpo&s;e, having neither <HI>forts</HI> nor <HI>batteries,</HI> nor any other <HI>&s;trong holds</HI> to defend them&s;elves. Perhaps they had never been at the ex|pence of erecting <HI>fortifications</HI>; or otherwi&s;e, they had carele&s;ly &s;uffer'd them to fall into ruin, and were now in no po&s;ture of defence. The pa&s;&s;es into their city were all naked and unguarded; they were altogether unprepared for an attack, and every day lia|ble to be &s;urpri&s;ed and taken: And yet they were as calm and ea&s;y, and as &s;afe from danger in their own apprehen&s;ions, as tho' they had been ever &s;o well guarded; and in circum&s;tances to defend them&s;elves again&s;t the mo&s;t powerful enemy.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="003758_0006_1002574A0F780988">THIS is the <HI>character</HI> of the <HI>inhabitants of</HI> LAISH: thus carele&s;s and &s;ecure were they. And two things are mention'd in my con|text, which might contribute hereto.</P>
<P N="1">I. THEY had their <HI>dependance</HI> on ZIDON for protection and &s;e|curity. Several hints are given from whence we may collect this. In the latter part of my <HI>text,</HI> 'tis &s;aid, <HI>There was no deliverer becau&s;e it was far from</HI> ZIDON. And in the 7. v. 'tis recorded of the <HI>&s;pies,</HI> that <HI>they found it was far from the</HI> ZIDONIANS. It looks as tho' the ZIDONIANS were the great protectors of the LAISHITES; their chief &s;trength and &s;ecurity. Perhaps they were a COLONY planted from ZIDON, &s;till under their care and juri&s;diction. They are &s;aid v. 7. to have <HI>dwelt after the manner</HI> of the ZIDONIANS. i. e. They imitated their cu&s;toms, and conformed to their way of liv|ing; one very natural account whereof is, their having originally &s;prang from them. To be &s;ure, the ZIDONIANS were at amity with them, firmly attacht to their Intere&s;t, and in readine&s;s to en|gage on their behalf again&s;t all oppo&s;ers.</P>
<P>Now the ZIDONIANS were a large and powerful people; well able to defend them&s;elves, and upon <HI>timely notice</HI> to protect the city of LAISH. And upon this account, they might be off their guard, and in their own opinion free from danger. However weak and defencele&s;s in them&s;elves, they were yet ea&s;y; depend|ing upon the &s;trength of ZIDON; not con&s;idering their <HI>di&s;tance</HI> from that place; and that they might be &s;urpri&s;ed and de&s;troyed, before they could call in their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Perhaps they flattered them&s;elves, their enemies would not dare attempt an expedition again&s;t them, while they knew they were the <HI>friends,</HI> and it may be the <HI>Government</HI> of a people &s;o powerful as were the ZIDONIANS.</P>
<P N="2">2. THEY <HI>had no Magi&s;trate in the land to put them to &s;hame in any thing,</HI> as we read in v. 7. There is no need of under&s;tanding the&s;e words in the mo&s;t rigid &s;en&s;e, as if there were none a|mong the LAISHITES cloath'd with <HI>civil Authority</HI>; But only that there was wanting a due care in <HI>Magi&s;trates</HI> to execute the tru&s;t
<PB N="5" REF="003758_0007_1002574BCEF12E18">
repos'd in them: One flagrant in&s;tance whereof, was, their being them&s;elves ea&s;ie, and &s;uffering the People to be &s;o too, while their Country lay in a wretched defencele&s;s &s;tate; expos'd to every invader, and liable to be taken from them. It belong'd to tho&s;e who were the <HI>heads</HI> of the People, to provide for their &s;afety and &s;ecurity. They &s;hould have been &s;en&s;ibly touch'd with concern to behold their weak and &s;hiftle&s;s condition, and taken effectual care, by <HI>warlike</HI> preparations, to place them in a po&s;ture of defence. They &s;hould have <HI>put the People to &s;hame</HI> in con&s;ideration of their faulty ea&s;e and &s;ecurity, while naked and unfortify'd; and encouraged their coming into mea&s;ures to &s;trengthen their borders again&s;t the attempts of their enemies And their not being &s;o tho'tful of this as was proper and becom|ing, was no doubt one great rea&s;on of their living in &s;uch un|guarded circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only add, this carele&s;sne&s;s of the <HI>People</HI> of LAISH, was a Character very di&s;graceful. 'Tis recorded in my Text to their di&s;honour; as an argument of their want of policy, and a due regard to their own &s;afety. And 'tis really a reproach to any People, con&s;idering the lu&s;ts of Men, and the wars and fightings every where ari&s;ing in the world here from, to neglect &s;ecuring them&s;elves again&s;t invaders. It was owing to this that LAISH was de&s;troy'd. If they had been &s;trengthen'd with walls and bulwarks; if they had encouraged among them a number of <HI>men of valour, ex|pert in war, that knew how to keep rank</HI> and with&s;tand an enemy, the DANITES would have been di&s;couraged from any attempts again&s;t them. 'Twas the carele&s;s, &s;ecure po&s;ture they were in, that invited them to enter their land; and it mu&s;t be a&s;cribed chiefly to this, that they &s;o ea&s;ily <HI>&s;mote them with the edge of the &s;word, and burnt their city with fire</HI>: Which leads me,</P>
<P N="3">III. To con&s;ider the <HI>conque&s;t and overthrow of</HI> LAISH. <HI>And they came to</HI> LAISH, &mdash; <HI>and &s;mote them with the edge of the &s;word, and burnt the city with fire.</HI> Two things are here worthy of notice. (1.) The <HI>per&s;ons</HI> making this conque&s;t. (2.) The <HI>conque&s;t</HI> it &s;elf.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="6" REF="003758_0008_1002574F618C3DD8">1. THE <HI>per&s;ons</HI> making this conque&s;t. And the&s;e were the DANITES: Not the whole tribe, who, &s;o long ago as when they enter'd <HI>Canaan,</HI> were above &s;ixty thou&s;and men <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Numb.</HI> 26.43.</NOTE>; but only a &s;mall <HI>regiment</HI> cho&s;en out of the re&s;t upon this occa&s;ion. They had be|fore (as became the &s;ubtilty of DAN, who was as a <HI>&s;erpent by the way</HI>) &s;ent out <HI>&s;pies to &s;earch the land,</HI> and inquire into the <HI>po&s;ture of its inhabitants</HI>: And from the account they brought of their &s;trange &s;ecurity and unguarded condition, they concluded &s;ix hundred men, <HI>expert</HI> and <HI>valiant,</HI> and well fitted with <HI>weapons of war,</HI> would be &s;ufficient to make an ea&s;y prey of them. A &s;mall force it &s;hou'd &s;eem to enter into an enemies country! and this upon a de&s;ign of making them&s;elves ma&s;ters of it: But knowing their circum&s;tances before hand, that they &s;hould find them carele&s;s and at ea&s;e, and in no po&s;ture of defence; they wi&s;ely thought a handful of men would be able to &s;urprize and take them.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>conque&s;t</HI> it &s;elf. And this was great and &s;urprizing. 'Tis &s;aid, <HI>they &s;mote them with the edge of the &s;word,</HI> i. e. the <HI>inhabitants of</HI> LAISH. And this they did, it &s;hould &s;eem, without limitation or di&s;tinction. Their eye did not pity, nor their hand &s;pare; but they greedily fell upon them, and made a mo&s;t awful and univer&s;al &s;laughter. As <HI>I&s;rael</HI> was commanded to do to <HI>Amalek,</HI> they <HI>&s;lew both man and woman, the infant and the &s;uckling.</HI> Having drawn the &s;word, they did not return it back, till they had de&s;troy'd both male and female, the high as well as the low; <HI>the young man and the virgin; the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> al&s;o, and the man of gray hairs.</HI> A mo&s;t a&s;to|ni&s;hing de&s;truction! &mdash; O the di&s;tre&s;s of the poor frighten'd and amaz'd people! &mdash; How bitter were their &s;hreiks and cries! &mdash; how doleful their dying groans and agonies! &mdash; But what &s;till heightens the horror, <HI>the city</HI> was &s;et into flames, and con&s;umed to a&s;hes. For &s;o it follows, <HI>and burnt the city with fire.</HI></P>
<P>IT may look as tho' the DANITES were herein wanting to them|&s;elves and their own intere&s;t. But po&s;&s;ibly they did this in the heat of battle, when men's tho'ts an't about them, and they are
<PB N="7" REF="003758_0009_10025751D5D73B78">
wont to neglect their own future advantage: or which is more pro|bable, they might <HI>&s;et the city on fire,</HI> the more to &s;urprize the people, to &s;trike them with the greater terror, that they might obtain a more ea&s;y conque&s;t over them.</P>
<P>AND in this action of theirs again&s;t LAISH, we have a remarka|ble accompli&s;hment of an ancient <HI>prophecy</HI> concerning <HI>Dan.</HI> We read, Deut. xxxiii. 22. <HI>And of Dan, he &s;aid, Dan is a lions whelp.</HI> And in this expedition he prov'd him&s;elf to be &s;o. i.e. He re&s;embled a fierce and couragious <HI>young lion.</HI> It follows, <HI>He &s;hall leap from Ba&s;han. Dan</HI> had no inheritance near <HI>Ba&s;han.</HI> The compari&s;on therefore lies in his being like a <HI>lion leaping on Ba&s;han.</HI> "'Tis one property of the <HI>lion</HI> to leap upon his prey, and fa&s;ten his nails and teeth into it: And &s;o did the DANITES &s;uddenly leap, as it were from one end of <HI>Canaan</HI> to the other, and &s;eize upon the city of LAISH". And no doubt, this is the thing, the <HI>&s;pirit of GOD</HI> had in view in this <HI>prophetic</HI> de&s;cription. And it's a good illu&s;tration of the jewi&s;h &s;tory, that this event, &s;o many hundred years, before its accompli&s;hment, &s;hould be made one of the main &s;trokes in <HI>Dan</HI>'s character.</P>
<P>BUT here ari&s;es a que&s;tion of &s;ome importance, and that is</P>
<P><HI>HOW could the</HI> DANITES, <HI>without great wickedne&s;s, barbarity and inju&s;tice, thus come upon the</HI> LAISHITES, <HI>and totally de&s;troy them</HI>?</P>
<P>IF we con&s;ult our <HI>context,</HI> we &s;hall find, the great rea&s;on of their undertaking this expedition was, that they might have a more com|modious Settlement. That which they po&s;&s;e&s;t already was too &s;canty; they were by the <HI>Amorites</HI> pent up into a narrow compa&s;s: and 'twas this that obliged them to &s;eek out for better quarters el&s;ewhere, at lea&s;t for part of their tribe; and that led them to go up again&s;t LAISH, having received a favourable report of their land. But where is the ju&s;tice of warring again&s;t this people, and taking away their lives, that they might &s;eize upon their proper|ties, and inherit their land? What right does the want of a good &s;ettlement in one people, give them to invade the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and
<PB N="8" REF="003758_0010_100257548C596850">
de&s;troy the lives of another, who are favour'd in this re&s;pect? Sure|ly it can convey none at all: and if it was all that could be &s;aid in defence of this action of the DANITES, that they <HI>wanted an inheritance,</HI> it would de&s;erve no better a name than wicked vio|lence; the mo&s;t barefac'd robbery and murder.</P>
<P>LET it therefore be ob&s;erved,</P>
<P>THE <HI>whole land of Canaan</HI> (within the bounds of which lay the city of LAISH, with all its territories,) was firmly convey'd by <HI>deed of gift</HI> from the GREAT SOVEREIGN of the World, to ABRA|HAM, and his POSTERITY, to be their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion forever. To this purpo&s;e we read, Gen. xii. 6, 7. <HI>And</HI> ABRAM <HI>pa&s;&s;ed thro' the land &mdash;. And the</HI> CANAANITE <HI>was then in the land. And the</HI> LORD <HI>appeared unto</HI> ABRAM, <HI>and &s;aid,</HI> UNTO THY SEED WILL I GIVE THIS LAND. The &s;ame promi&s;e is very particularly repeat|ed, Chap. xiii v. 14, 15. <HI>And the</HI> LORD <HI>&s;aid to</HI> ABRAM, &mdash; <HI>lift up now thine eyes and look from the place where thou art, northward, and &s;outhward, and ea&s;tward, and we&s;tward. For all the land which thou &s;ee&s;t,</HI> TO THEE WILL I GIVE IT, AND TO THY SEED FOR EVER. And in the xv. chap. 18. v. we have recorded a mo&s;t ex|plicit and formal grant of this land. <HI>In that &s;ame day the</HI> LORD <HI>made a covenant with</HI> ABRAM, <HI>&s;aying,</HI> UNTO THY SEED HAVE I GIVEN THIS LAND, <HI>from the river of Egypt, unto the great river, the river Euphrates.</HI> And when THE SEED OF ABRAHAM were multi|plied into a great people, we find the ble&s;&s;ed <HI>GOD</HI> thus be&s;peaking them, Exod. vi. 8. <HI>And I will bring you into the land, concerning the which I did &s;wear to</HI> GIVE IT, <HI>to Abraham, to I&s;aac, and to Jacob; and</HI> I WILL GIVE IT YOU FOR AN HERITAGE. From the&s;e texts it appears plain, that the <HI>land of Canaan</HI> was given of <HI>GOD</HI> to the <HI>people of I&s;rael</HI>; and that the <HI>grant</HI> was &s;everal times repeated in the mo&s;t ample and &s;olemn manner.</P>
<P>Now the infinite GOD having the fir&s;t and mo&s;t ab&s;olute and in|di&s;putable title to this whole earth, a grant of any part of it from him mu&s;t convey the be&s;t and &s;ure&s;t claim; a title paramount to all others, and that will remain good again&s;t every other claim,
<PB N="9" REF="003758_0011_100257561223B8F8">
how long &s;o ever any per&s;ons of any nation or character may have been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the land thus convey'd.

<P>FROM the&s;e premi&s;es, it may be affirm'd, tho' the city of LAISH and the land bordering thereon, were po&s;&s;e&s;t by tho&s;e who had long been inhabitants of <HI>Canaan</HI>; yet that they were not the <HI>true owners</HI> of what they had in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The city they liv'd in, and the lands they had under improvement, were the <HI>property</HI> of the <HI>feed of Abraham,</HI> freely granted and confirmed to them from the <HI>great Lord</HI> of the whole earth: and they had a right to enter upon po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what had been thus given them, whenever they &s;aw fit. And as the DANITES, who were the <HI>po&s;terity of Abraham,</HI> and <HI>one</HI> of the <HI>tribes of I&s;rael,</HI> were now in want of a good &s;ettlement, there was no ob&s;tacle in the way of their coming to LAISH, if they were able to conquer and turn them out of their land. And tho' in the doing of this, they might be in&s;trumental of taking a|way their lives, yet might they warrantably do it: for the <HI>people of I&s;rael,</HI> of whom the DANITES were a part, not only had a title to the <HI>land of Canaan</HI> made over to them, but were commanded and encouraged by the great <HI>GOD,</HI> to go and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the land, as we may &s;ee at large, in the fir&s;t chap. of <HI>Jo&s;hua.</HI> And over and above this, they were impower'd to de&s;troy the <HI>old inhabitants of the land,</HI> as is plain from a great number of texts, which we are all acquainted with, in the &s;eries of the <HI>mo&s;aick</HI> hi&s;tory. And it looks as if the <HI>&s;upreme maje&s;ty</HI> had manife&s;ted it to be his mind, that <HI>his people I&s;rael</HI> &s;hould be the <HI>executioners</HI> of his wrath upon the <HI>&s;imul inhabitants of Canaan, the mea&s;ure of who&s;e iniquity was now full.</HI></P>
<P>THE ca&s;e before us is therefore an extraordinary one. What the DANITES did, would in any other people, have been utterly unlawful; a great piece of inju&s;tice and iniquity: but a warrantable
<PB N="10" REF="003758_0012_10025757ACBBE398">
action in them, becau&s;e the <HI>&s;overeign GOD</HI> had vacated the right the <HI>inhabitants of Canaan</HI> had to their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and convey'd it away from them to the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI>: and over and above this had con&s;titu|ted <HI>this people</HI> his <HI>Deputies,</HI> to puni&s;h their iniquities, which had ri|pen'd them for de&s;truction.</P>
<P>NATIONS and cities &s;hould learn herefrom the dreadful evil and danger of &s;in; and be afraid to go on commiting it, hardening them&s;elves again&s;t <HI>GOD,</HI> lea&s;t he &s;hould be provoked in his holy and righteous providence, to bring them to ruin.</P>
<P>THEY &s;hould al&s;o take heed of encouraging them&s;elves, from this action of the DANITES, which was out of the common cour&s;e of things to take up arms again&s;t others. If nece&s;&s;itated hereto in order to redre&s;s Injuries, or defend them&s;elves when unrighteou&s;ly invaded, or for any other wi&s;e and good cau&s;e, they may do well to make u&s;e of force: 'tis con&s;onant to the rea&s;on of things, and perfectly con|&s;i&s;tent with the laws of our holy religion&punc; Tho' 'tis contrary to both, for nations to act in conformity to the <HI>pattern</HI> of the&s;e DANITES, i. e. to make war with a people and take away their properties and lives, without provocation, or having been abus'd by them: unle&s;s with the <HI>men of I&s;rael</HI> they could produce a <HI>warrant from heaven,</HI> to ju&s;tify their <HI>warlike</HI> proceedings. But I mu&s;t not enlarge here, 'tis time we proceed now,</P>
<P N="4">IV. To con&s;ider, <HI>their having no deliverer, becau&s;e they were far from</HI> ZIDON. Several times in this <HI>chapter</HI> particular notice is taken of the <HI>di&s;tance</HI> of ZIDON from LAISH. The &s;pies from the <HI>tribe of Dan,</HI> pre&s;ently got acquainted with this, and &s;et a &s;pecial mark up|on it, v. 7. And no doubt upon their return, this was one encou|raging article in their report to their brethren.

<P>THE lea&s;t that can be gathered from hence is, whatever was the condition of LAISH, yet that the DANITES were aware of the
<PB N="11" REF="003758_0013_1002575A27034630">
&s;trength of ZIDON: and at the &s;ame time well appris'd of their being in league with LAISH, and in readine&s;s (at lea&s;t if apply'd to herefor) to &s;end a &s;ufficient force to guard and protect them. Their greate&s;t concern therefore &s;eems to have been, to carry on their de&s;ign again&s;t LAISH <HI>&s;o &s;ecretly,</HI> as that it might not be known, nor if po&s;&s;ible &s;o much as &s;u&s;pected. And this they were under ad|vantage to do, by rea&s;on of the di&s;tance between LAISH and ZIDON. The&s;e two cities were not very remote from each other; yet wer<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> they &s;o far a&s;under, that with due care and caution, the <HI>men of Dan</HI> might come again&s;t LAISH, without the knowledge of ZIDON. And it was owing to their policy in thus coming again&s;t them, that they were not di&s;appointed in their attempt. If they had pro|claimed their de&s;ign; advanced towards the city by &s;low and lei|&s;urely &s;teps, giving warning of their approach; the <HI>men of</HI> LAISH would doubtle&s;s have had help from ZIDON. But falling upon them &s;uddenly, without the &s;u&s;picion of the ZIDONIANS, and while the LAISHITES them&s;elves were tho'tle&s;s of danger, they at once de&s;troy'd them: and this, without any <HI>deliverer.</HI> Says my text, <HI>there was no deliverer, becau&s;e they were far from</HI> ZIDON.</P>
<P>AND herein appears, in the &s;tronge&s;t light, the folly of the peo|ple of LAISH, in &s;uffering their city to lie &s;o &s;hamefully <HI>expos'd</HI> to enemies. Notwith&s;tanding the &s;trength of ZIDON, and their dependance on them for protection and defence, we &s;ee they were totally de&s;troy'd.

<P>AND in the exerci&s;e of the&s;e <HI>military virtues,</HI> let us faithfully employ our &s;elves even to the death. Never let us <HI>de&s;ert our po&s;t,</HI> or <HI>fly from our colours</HI>; neither let us fight as tho&s;e that <HI>beat the air,</HI> but with true life and vigour, as tho&s;e that are in earne&s;t, and fight for their &s;ouls and a never ending eternity. And if by &s;urprize, or thro' the &s;ubtilty of our adver&s;aries, we &s;hou'd get a foil in one <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">; let us take heart, and reinforce the battel: or if we &s;hou'd gain the field; let us not lie by carele&s;s and &s;ecure, but be ready for a new on&s;et. And thus let us go on <HI>fighting the good fightt of faith,</HI> till we have <HI>overcome thro' the blood of the Lamb</HI> and then
<PB N="19" REF="003758_0021_1002576DEB3A2598">
will our <HI>glorious Head and Leader,</HI> confer upon us a <HI>crown of life.</HI> For the&s;e are the words on which he has encouraged us to hope, Rev. 3.21. <HI>To him that overcometh will I grant to &s;it with me in my throne even as I al&s;o overcame, and am &s;it down with my father in his throne,</HI> Amen.</P>
