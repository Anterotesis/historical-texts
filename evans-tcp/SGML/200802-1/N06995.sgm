And as we would glorify God and be approved of him, we mu&s;t through Grace in Chri&s;t, make him our only Tru&s;t; live de|pendant upon him, and devoted to him; we mu&s;t love him with all our Hearts, &s;u|premely, ultimately and univer&s;ally; and love our Neighbour as our&s;elves: The Re|deemer's Intere&s;t mu&s;t lie with weight upon our Minds; we mu&s;t be of a publick Spirit, Friends to lawful Society, and lay our&s;elves out in the right Improvement of our &s;everal Gifts, Talents and Advantages. We are embodied Spirits, and related to both Worlds in this Re&s;pect: and while we dwell in this, we are acting for the next, which we &s;hall find a World of intollerable and endle&s;s Mi|&s;ery, or of un&s;peakable and everla&s;ting Joy and Felicity, according to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> Beha|viour.

in the advancement of Chri&s;t's Kingdom, and the be&s;t Intere&s;t of that Body to which we belonged, we &s;hall through the Merits of our Lord and Saviour, receive an ample Re|ward, even a crown of life in the coming world. And of all Men it concerns us thus to Serve GOD and our Generation: for our Advanta|ges are di&s;tingui&s;hing, and our Obligations ari&s;e in Proportion to our Privileges and Ad|vantages. The Word of GOD plainly re|veals, and &s;trictly enjoyns this, <HI>that more &s;ure Word of Prophecy, whereunto we do well that we take Heed.</HI> This is implied and inculcated in the Words of our Text. <HI>But as God hath di&s;tributed to every Man, as the Lord hath called every one, &s;o let him walk.</HI> &mdash; The Duty enjoyn|ed with divine Authority is plain, altho' the Reward is not particularly mentioned: but all Go&s;pel Precepts, Encouragements and Exhortations are urged with this Motive, (viz.) That they who reject the divine Coun|&s;els and continue Ob&s;tinate &s;hall peri&s;h in their Rebellion; while they that hearken, be|lieve, and obey, through the efficacious In|fluences of the Holy Gho&s;t, &s;hall for Je&s;us's &s;ake, be gloriou&s;ly and eternally Rewarded.</P>

in the foregoing Ver&s;es: But others &s;uppo&s;e them to be the beginning of the following Di&s;cour&s;e, wherein he treats of Chri&s;tians of all Ranks and Orders abiding in their re&s;pec|tive Callings, and faithfully di&s;charging the Duties thereof.</P>
<P>This appears to me the Apo&s;tles De&s;ign; and thus I &s;hall apply and improve the Text.</P>
<P>The Words are very comprehen&s;ive, and include all Men, of all Ranks, and of all De|nominations; Men of every Station, and e|very Character, from the highe&s;t to the low|e&s;t, that have any Gifts of any Kind or De|gree, whereby they are capable of u&s;efulne&s;s in their Generation; as well him that has but one Talent, as him that hath five or ten. <HI>According as GOD hath di&s;tributed to him,</HI> &s;o he is &s;trongly bound and obliged faithfully to improve his Gifts or Talents, and in that Calling wherein God hath called him. For the Apo&s;tle goes on and &s;ays, <HI>as the Lord hath called every one.</HI> That God who gives us dif|fering Gifts, and qualifies us for different Of|fices, hath called us thereunto, &amp; commend|ed us to abide therein, &amp; faithfully di&s;charge the &s;everal Duties thereof. <HI>As the Lord hath called every one, &s;o let him walk</HI> &mdash; Let him a|bide in the Po&s;t wherein God hath fixed him, and there let him act as one that expects to give an Account.

according to his Ability, and not a Man to be idle. And as there are various Parts of the &s;ame Work to be managed and perform|ed, &s;ome of a more difficult Nature, and of greater Importance, and &s;ome of le&s;s, &s;o he hath proportioned his Gifts accordingly. See Mat. 25.14, 15. <HI>For the Kingdom of Heaven is as a Man travelling into a far Coun|try, who called his own Servants, and delivered unto them his Goods: and unto one he gave five Pounds, to another two, and to another one, to every Man according to his &s;everal ability; and &s;traightway took his Journey; &s;aying unto them, occupy till I come.</HI> Luk. 19.13. Agreeably to this, the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, Rom. 12.6. <HI>Having then Gifts differing according to the Grace that is given us.</HI> This was &s;poken with immedi|ate Regard to the Church, con&s;idered as a religious Body. But it is true when applied to the State; &amp; likewi&s;e when to the Church and State; con&s;idered as a collective Body. Accordingly when we view the whole Body, we &s;ee Gifts of a different Kind, and differ|ing in Degree, di&s;per&s;ed abroad among the Children of Men.</P>
<P>God hath abundantly inriched &s;ome with royal Gifts and Graces, and qualified them to &s;it upon the Throne, to wear the Crown and &s;way the Sceptre: <HI>For it is by him that Kings reign and Princes decree Ju&s;tice</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. 8.15.</NOTE>.</P>

To Others, he hath given Wi&s;dom and Under&s;tanding, &s;agacious and penetrating. Minds, Quickne&s;s of Apprehen&s;ion, and a firm un&s;haken Re&s;olution, as well as Loyalty fitting for Mini&s;ters of State, to &s;it round a|bout the King, and a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his impor|tant Coun&s;els.</P>
<P>To Others, he hath given peculiar Gifts to govern in their re&s;pective Provinces: clothed them with a natural Authority in their very Make, and endowed them with an agreeable Mixture of Skill and Wi&s;dom, In|tegrity and Meekne&s;s, Judgment &amp; Mercy, that all around are di&s;po&s;ed to honour and obey them with Freedom and Chearfulne&s;s.</P>
<P>To Others he hath imparted the proper Gifts of Judges and Coun&s;ellors, di&s;tingui&s;h|ing them with the Faculty of di&s;cerning be|tween Right &amp; wrong, and endowing them with a &s;teady Mind, and a Principle of Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, that with courage and re&s;olution they may judge with righteous Judgment, <HI>ju&s;tifying the righteous and condemning the wick|ed,</HI> agreeable to the Command given us in Deut. 25.1. And to the&s;e he hath variou&s;ly di&s;tributed his Gifts, to &s;ome in greater De|grees, to others in le&s;s, as there are Po&s;ts of Honour of the &s;ame Kind, but of a different Degree. As one is to act in a more elevated Station, and another in a le&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="008888_0011_10309070189C2BC0">
To others he hath given the Faculty of Speaking, and the Art ot rea&s;oning &amp; plea|ding in Matters of Controver&s;y; that Right may take Place, and the innocent be cleared, while the guilty are puni&s;hed; and every one have Ju&s;tice done him.</P>
<P>And Others he hath formed for executive Ju&s;tice, that our Rights may be maintained, Vice and Immorality &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and the be&s;t good of the Common-wealth promoted.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame Time our God, through the Riches of his Grace in Chri&s;t the Redeemer, <HI>who purcha&s;ed the Church with his own Blood,</HI> hath furni&s;hed Others with Gifts and Graces &s;uited to the important Work of the &s;acred Mini&s;try. And among the&s;e he hath vari|ou&s;ly di&s;tributed his Gifts.</P>
<P>To &s;ome he hath given great Degrees of Knowledge, both divine and humane, Depth of Judgment, and a large Acquaintance e&s;|pecially with polemical Divinity, and &s;et them with <HI>Paul</HI> for the Defence of the Go&s;|pel; Some he hath made Boanerges Sons of Thunder, to alarm the &s;ecure, and reform the profane: To &s;ome he hath given the Charms of Eloquence, that like <HI>Apollos</HI> of old, they have a di&s;tingui&s;hing Faculty of alluring and per&s;wading weary and heavy la|den Sinners to ca&s;t them&s;elves with all their Burdens upon the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us: Some he

<P>Some Degree of the&s;e Gifts all true Mini|&s;ters have; but while &s;ome excel in one, o|thers do in another. So that this being the Ca&s;e, the Kingdom of the Redeemer is built up in the World, through the promi&s;ed Pre|&s;ence and Ble&s;&s;ing of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and the Intere&s;t of the Common-wealth greatly ad|vanced.</P>

<P>Others, our God, who &s;tiles him&s;elf <HI>a Man of War,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exod. 15.3.</NOTE> hath formed for the Field of Battle: <HI>He is their Strength, and teaches their Hands to war, and their Fingers to fight:</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;">P&s;al. 144.1</NOTE>

<P>And while &s;ome are mo&s;t ingenious at Mechanicks, others well under&s;tand, and di|ligently pur&s;ue the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Hu&s;bandry, and cultivate <HI>the Field</HI> by which <HI>the King him|&s;elf is &s;erved.</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;">Eccl. 5.9.</NOTE> Thus God hath variou&s;ly di&s;|tributed his Gifts among the Children of Men.</P>

<P>As Man is made a &s;ociable Creature, and as the De&s;ign of his Maker was, that he &s;hould be formed into Society; and as there are ne|ce&s;&s;ary Works of different Kinds and Degrees

to be performed in every Society in Order to advance the good of the whole; &s;o it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary that one &s;hould be fixed above another in a more dignified Station than his Neigh|bour; and each one exert him&s;elf in his pro|per Po&s;t, according to his &s;everal Ability. And thus God, the great Lord of the Uni|ver&s;e, who is all wi&s;e and infinitely good, a God of Order, and not of Confu&s;ion, hath called and fixed every of us. He hath not only furni&s;hed us with Gifts, but a&s;&s;igned us a Work to exerci&s;e them in. And every One, according as his Talents are, and his Calling is, is under proportionable Obliga|tions to be diligent in Bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;ervent in Spirit, &s;erving God and his Generation. &dagger; Indeed we have all one general Calling, and that is to be Chri&s;tians: But con&s;idered as Chri&s;tians, we have different Works a&s;&s;igned us, and we are called to different Offices.</P>
<P>Some he hath called to civil Po&s;ts of Ho|nour, fixing them above their fellow-men in General, inve&s;ting them with Authority from on high, &s;ome with greater Degrees, and &s;ome with le&s;s, and bidding them rule in the Fear of God. 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 23.3. All &s;uch are called of God, and their Authority is from him <HI>who rules in the Kingdom of Men. For Promotion cometh neither from the Ea&s;t, nor from the We&s;t, nor from the South,</HI> no, nor

from the North, <HI>But God is the Judge: He putteth down one, and &s;etteth up another.</HI> P&s;al. 75.6, 7. And becau&s;e God hath exalted them to an elavated Station, and clothed them with that Authority wherein they are to act in &s;ome Mea&s;ure like him&s;elf, he hath <HI>called them Gods,</HI> but at the &s;ame Time, told them that <HI>they &s;hould die like Man,</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. 82.6 7.</NOTE> that they may be humble and dependant, and walk righte|ou&s;ly before him. The Apo&s;tle confirms this in the new Te&s;tament, and &s;ays, Rom. 13.1, 2, 4. <HI>For there is no Power but of God: The Powers that be, are ordained of God. Who|&s;oever therefore re&s;i&s;teth the Power, re&s;i&s;teth the Ordinance of God: and they that re&s;i&s;t &s;hall re|ceive to them&s;elves Damnation. For he is the Mini&s;ter of God to Thee for good.</HI> And having called them to, and fixed them in their ele|vated Po&s;ts, he bids them abide therein, and improve their &s;uperior Gifts and Advantages for the be&s;t good of the Community in which his Providence hath made them Rulurs. Their Calling and Bu&s;ine&s;s is, to con&s;ult the Intere&s;t of the Common-wealth, to enact Laws which have a direct Tendency to promote the good of the whole, and &s;ee them well executed.

Law, as they would an&s;wer the great and glorious Ends of Government. Indeed it is of the la&s;t Importance, that civil Rulers be well acquainted with the Law of God, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the Go&s;pel Religion; that they <HI>be renewed in the Spirit of their Minds,</HI> and u|nited to Je&s;us Chri&s;t by a living Faith which is productive of all good Works.

But happy are they who have Rulers that are Men of Skill and Wi&s;dom to con|cert Mea&s;ures for their Peace and Safety; for <HI>by Men of Under&s;tanding and Knowledge, the State is prolonged.</HI> Wherefore the Direction given in this Ca&s;e is, Deut. 1.13. <HI>Take ye wi&s;e Men and under&s;tanding, and well known among your Tribes, and I will make them Rulers over you.</HI> Moreover, civil Rulers &s;hould be Men of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and free from Parti|ality. The Sceptre of our God is a Sceptre of Righteou&s;ne&s;s; and the righteous Lord loveth Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and hateth Iniquity. <HI>Holy, ju&s;t and true are all the Admini&s;trations of his Providence, and clear and righteous are all his Ways, and all his Judgments.</HI> And civil Rulers are to imitate him in Point of Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s. As God re&s;pects not the Per&s;on of any, &s;o neither &s;hould civil Rulers; <HI>for they judge for the Lord.</HI> The celebrated Judge HALE would not receive a Pre&s;ent at the Hands of a Man, who&s;e cau&s;e he was about to judge, knowing that a <HI>Gift,</HI> as the wi&s;e Man expre&s;&s;es it, Prov. 17.8. <HI>is as a precious Stone in the Eyes of him that receiveth it; whither&s;oever it turneth, it pro&s;pereth.</HI> It dazzles the Eyes, and perverts the Judgment of him that receives it. It tends to this, and
<PB N="20" REF="008888_0019_1030908780AED9B8">
hath this Effect, (it is to be feared,) on &s;ome' but (we hope) not on all. It would be well for Rulers and Judges to look upon Per&s;ons as Strangers in &s;ome Sen&s;e, as unknown by them, when they are about to judge their Cau&s;e, and judge with Righteous Judgment. Lev. 19.15 <HI>Ye &s;hall do no unrighteou&s;ne&s;s in Judgment: Thou &s;halt not re&s;pect the Per&s;on of the poor, nor honour the Per&s;on of the mighty; but in Righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;halt thou judge thy neigh|bour.</HI> And &s;ee Deut. 1.17. <HI>Ye &s;hall not re|&s;pect Per&s;ons in Judgment, but you &s;hall hear the &s;mall as well as the great.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, civil Rulers &s;hould be of an undaunted Courage and Re&s;olution, Firm|ne&s;s of Mind, and a &s;teadfa&s;t Re&s;olution to maintain the Honour, and an&s;wer the Ends of Government are highly nece&s;&s;ary in all that wield the Sword of Ju&s;tice, that they may put an End to Vice as much as po&s;&s;ible, and promote Religion and Virtue. And it concerns them to put on Courage, and at all Times carry an even Hand, paying no &s;lavi&s;h Regard to the Frowns, nor the Flatteries of Men. Deut. 1.17. <HI>You &s;hall not be afraid of the Face of man, for the Judgment is God's.</HI> They are &s;et for a Terror to evil Doers, and for a Prai&s;e to them that do well.</P>
<P>Moreover, civil Rulers &s;hould be Men of Kindne&s;s and Mercy. Our God is a merci|ful

And although it be|comes them, with an undaunted Courage to frown upon Vice, and puni&s;h Criminals, yet it &s;hould be done with a tender Heart, and a compa&s;&s;ionate Mind; not as if they de|lighted in Cruelty, but as being nece&s;&s;itated to act as they do in Point of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and in Order to maintain the Honour of Religion, and the Safety of the Common|wealth.</P>
<P>Moreover, civil Rulers &s;hould be of a ge|nerous publick Spirit. Our God is infinitely

As civil Fathers, they &s;hould have an affectionate Concern for the Rights of the People, looking upon their Intere&s;ts as their own, and e&s;teeming the flouri&s;hing State of the Common-wealth, their own Security and Pro&s;perity.

<P>Once more here, civil Rulers &s;hould be Men fearing God, and practi&s;ing real Piety. Their Bu&s;ine&s;s is, to enact good and whole|&s;ome

Laws, and then &s;hew their Regard to them by an agreeable Walk and Conver&s;a|tion.

But if, on the contrary, they live peaceable and quiet Lives, in all Godline&s;s, and appear to be Men that fear the Lord and hate Covetou&s;ne&s;s, their Example will be likely to influence all around them. If the political Head is &s;ick, the whole Body will be faint, but if the Head is in a good State of Health, the Body will be well. When Kings of old ruled well, and lived well, <HI>Things went well in Judah.</HI> In|deed there are always Exceptions under ge|neral Rules; but in the Nature and Order of things, &s;uch a Practice in Heads or Rulers has this Tendency. Thus briefly, the&s;e things, this Temper and Practice in Rulers are of happy Con&s;equence. And having the&s;e Qua|lifications, and being fixed in Po&s;ts of Honor by divine Providence, it becomes them to abide in their Calling, and diligently perform the &s;everal Duties of their Office, ruling for GOD, and the good of the People. <HI>So let them Walk.</HI>&mdash; Let them abide in their Po&s;ts, and &s;tudy to do their own Bu&s;ine&s;s.

<P>And while God is furni&s;hing &s;ome with Gifts &s;uited to manage this great and impor|tant Work, and calling them to it; he fur|ni&s;hes others with Gifts and Graces &s;uited to carry on the glorious Work of the Mini&s;try, and calls them to that.

Kings them|&s;elves, as Kings, have no Right to invade the Office of the Go&s;pel Mini&s;ter; nor may the wi&s;e&s;t of Rulers break over into that &s;a|cred Inclo&s;ure; much le&s;s may illeterate, un&s;kilful Men, who need to be taught the fir&s;t Principles of Religion. King <HI>Uzziah</HI> attempted to offer Incen&s;e upon the Altar, and God &s;mote him with a Lepro&s;y, and he was a Leper to the Day of his Death. 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 26th Chap. So neither &s;hould Go&s;pel Mini|&s;ters leave their proper work and Bu&s;ine&s;s, and intermeddle too much with the Affairs of State.

We &s;hould then be diligent in Bu&s;ine&s;s, and faithful in our Betru&s;tments, and not hinder, but help one another, not aggravate, but alleviate each others Burthens.

<P>In his holy and righteous Providence he hath &s;een fit to take away by Death, our gra|cious King GEORGE the SECOND, of ble&s;&s;ed Memory; the civil Father of the Engli&s;h Na|tion; and a mo&s;t indulgent Father: who in his Life, was ever concerned for, and tender of the Rights and Liberties of his Briti&s;h <HI>I&s;|rael.</HI> In who&s;e happy Reign and under whole ble&s;&s;ed Influence, the Nation, for a long Time, enjoyed the greate&s;t of Liberties and be&s;t of Privileges. And verily his Death gave the whole Kingdom a Shock, and was enough to put every Subject upon a &s;erious Enquiry; what have we done, that God is provoked to take our King and our Head from us? And this little Province hath &s;pe|cial Rea&s;on to be alarmed, to awake, and be|take our&s;elves to God, and put our Tru&s;t and Confidence in him, and look unto him for the &s;anctification of this awful Providence: For he was a Father to us indeed, from whom we received large Benefits in a Time when greatly needed. We &s;hould even &s;unk under the Weight of our heavy Burdens in the pre|&s;ent di&s;tre&s;&s;ing War, had not we been en|couraged and &s;upported by him. But he is gone.

<P>This is a loud Call of divine Providence to us all, to abide in our Callings, well improve our Time, and our Gifts, and prepare to meet the Lord our Judge. Hereby they that are &s;tiled Gods in the &s;acred Oracles, &s;ee that they mu&s;t die as other Men. If Kings die, certainly their Subjects mu&s;t, from the high|e&s;t to the lowe&s;t. Wherefore it concerns us, one and all, to hearken to the voice of Pro|vidence, and &s;tand &amp; mourn, and return to our Duty. And agreeable to King Solomon's Advice, Eccl. 9.10. <HI>Do what our Hands find to do, with all our Might; for there is no Work, nor Device, nor Knowledge, nor Wi&s;dom in the Grave, whether we are going.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, it has been a Time of great Mortality throughout this Land: Multitudes both at Home and in our Armies have died, and the Places that knew them, will know them here no more.

You are the Fathers of the Common-wealth, and all our Eyes are upon you.</P>
<P>Wherefore &s;ee to it that your Powers of Mind are &s;anctified by Grace; and always remember that you judge for the Lord. Look with an impartial Eye into all Matters laid be|fore you, and act with a generous Spirit in whatever you do for the Government.

<P>And we would recommend it to you in all your Coun&s;els, Acts and Judgments, to be of a calm and &s;teady Mind, to carry an even Hand, and never be precipitate in your Re|&s;olutions and Determinations, and e&s;pecially when the Ca&s;e is Dark and intricate, and of great Consequence. <HI>Let your Moderation be known to all men,</HI> and let your Example in holy Conver&s;ation &s;hine before the People,
