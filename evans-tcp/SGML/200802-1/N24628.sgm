<HEAD>THE HAUNTED HOUSE. A Narrative, founded upon Fact.</HEAD>
<P>IN a village, &s;ome di&s;tance from town, there lived a re&s;pectable family, who had once occupied an adjoining hou&s;e, which, on account of the frequent knockings and di&s;turbances they had heard and met with therein, they were under the di&s;agreeable ne|ce&s;&s;ity of leaving. Mr. Goodwin, the owner thereof, had ince&s;&s;antly endeavoured to let it, but in vain, the report was too prevalent, and the hou&s;e became a &s;ad burden on his hands; he had often adverti&s;ed it, and, indeed, offered it at &s;o low a rent, that &s;everal were induced to try it. An old &s;oldier, who had more than once buffeted all the dangers of war, now begged permi&s;&s;ion to lodge in it for a few days upon trial, promi&s;ing, if it were po&s;&s;ible to inhabit it, that he would immediately take a lea&s;e on the terms propo&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="032623_0005_0FF3E0461D9666E0">Permi&s;&s;ion was readily granted for this e&s;&s;ay, and this old follower of Mars, who deemed the whole &s;tory but a mere empty report, determined to &s;leep by him&s;elf that night in the hou&s;e; for which pur|po&s;e, he left in the day time a loaded pi&s;tol, and a broad &s;word, near the room which he intended for his bed-chamber, and &s;olaced him&s;elf with the plea|&s;ing idea of having obtained a very comfortable bar|gain; having now properly &s;ecured the hall door, re&s;olving that there &s;hould be neither egre&s;s nor in|gre&s;s, except to him&s;elf, he went <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o take a &s;ufficient quantity of &s;tout beer, and prepare him&s;elf for the attack.</P>
<P>It was rather late before he returned, and he went to bed &s;omewhat mellow, laughing at all the non|&s;en&s;e of gho&s;ts, &s;pirits, and hobgoblins. After a &s;leep of about two hours, a dreadful noi&s;e awoke him: he li&s;tened &mdash;and heard a foot a&s;cending the &s;tairs &s;o plain, that he thought it expedient to run into the next room for his pi&s;tols; accordingly he armed him&s;elf with two, one in each hand, and now on the top of the &s;tairs, he perceived a horrid figure, which undauntedly &s;tood before him, apparently very furious, and nodding with &s;eeming anger.</P>
<P>Our hero repeatedly inquired, who and what he was, whether dead or alive; but there was no an&s;|wer; he then threatened to fire, which &s;o evidently exa&s;perated the figure, that he &s;tamped &s;everal times with his foot again&s;t the ground, and made &s;uch a violent noi&s;e, that the very &s;tair-ca&s;e &s;hook with it; the &s;oldier pre&s;ented and fired, but the figure did not &s;eem at all di&s;mayed; on the contrary, he &s;miled with di&s;dain; finding this without effect, he now di&s;charged the other, which, in&s;tead of intimidating his unknown antagoni&s;t, rendered him, if po&s;&s;ible, more re&s;olute and fierce; the &s;oldier &s;eemed &s;ome|what &s;urpri&s;ed, and apprehended that it was neither fle&s;h or blood, &s;ince his pi&s;tols had failed; however, not willing to remain longer defencele&s;s, he ha&s;ten|ed for his broad &s;word: the &s;pirit pur&s;ued him, and
<PB N="7" REF="032623_0006_0FF3E04849871A28">
ere he could enter the room where it was, gave him &s;uch a violent blow, as almo&s;t felled him to the ground; as &s;oon as he had recovered him&s;elf, for he was very much &s;tunned, he looked about him, but the figure had vani&s;hed. This event having taken place in the &s;ummer time, the &s;un afforded him an early opportunity of looking about; he went to bed again, with the &s;word in his hand, but being fre|quently interrupted with noi&s;es, could &s;leep no more. Early in the morning he took leave of this haunted hou&s;e, and began &s;eriou&s;ly to think on what had pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>At breakfa&s;t his friends were very eager to hear the &s;trange occurrences of the night, for knowing the blunt character of this man, and his di&s;belief of gho&s;ts, they could not doubt the veracity of all he &s;aid: he confe&s;&s;ed there was &s;omething exceedingly &s;trange in the bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;ufficient indeed to in|timidate the mo&s;t brave, but he was determined to make another attempt; he could not imagine that Heaven would allow the dead to hurt the living, and his face bore ample te&s;timony of the &s;everity of the blow. "I forgot," &s;ays he, "at any rate to inter|rogate it, as I am told I &s;hould have done&mdash;I am therefore re&s;olved, this night, to have further con|viction, and &s;atisfy my&s;elf if the figure be really, or not, &s;upernatural."</P>
<P>This determination was deemed by all his friends exceedingly daring and dangerous, but the &s;oldier would not be di&s;&s;uaded from his de&s;ign, as his honor, he thought, was too deeply concerned; be&s;ides, he could not bear the idea that an enemy, thus un|known, or, what was &s;till wor&s;e, a meer &s;hadow, &s;hould get the better of him. Another e&s;&s;ay was therefore looked upon ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The next night he provided him&s;elf with larger pi&s;tols, and abundance of ball and powder&mdash; He did not load till about the time he was going to bed&mdash; he left a chair again&s;t the door, thereby to prove
<PB N="8" REF="032623_0007_0FF3E04BB69B5AD8">
whether the thing was &s;upernatural, or not; if &s;u|pernatural, he &s;uppo&s;ed it would enter, as gho&s;ts are thought to do, through the key-hole, or, at lea&s;t, without throwing down the chair. However, in the middle of the night, he heard the &s;ame knock|ings, the door opened, and down went the chair, which added not a little to the noi&s;e. Our hero ro&s;e, &s;eized two pi&s;tols, and fir&s;t que&s;tioning who he was, the figure which was evidently not the &s;ame he &s;aw the preceding night, made no reply; he threatened to fire&mdash;</P>
<P>"Forbear," cried the &s;uppo&s;ed &s;pirit, "if you will be &s;atisfied, follow me."</P>
<P>"I will," replied the &s;oldier, "but ob&s;erve this, that if any danger awaits me, as you are my leader, it is at you therefore I &s;hall di&s;charge the contents of the&s;e."</P>
<P>He followed him&mdash;the figure brought him down &s;tairs to a private place under ground, where, a clande&s;tine door being opened, he was admitted into the pre&s;ence of a gang of robbers; the &s;oldier &s;till defended him&s;elf with his pi&s;tols, vowing he would di&s;charge them if his life was threatened, but the captain of the gang a&s;&s;ured him he was &s;afe.</P>
<P>"I am the per&s;on," cried he, "who gave you the blow la&s;t night; believe me, I &s;hould not have &s;o re&s;olutely &s;tood your fire, had I not taken previous care to prevent your pi&s;tols (which you left here) from endangering my life; but you have been too prudent this time. We have long inhabited this place, and made it a practice to deter people from living in the hou&s;e, that our &s;tay might be long and uninterrupted; we take it by turns to haunt the hou&s;e. Now, therefore, as we have been &s;o far can|did to you, ere you depart from this, you mu&s;t &s;wear not to divulge our &s;ecret within fourteen days, by which time, we &s;hall provide &s;ome other habita|tion for our&s;elves, and give you quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this hou&s;e."</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="032623_0008_0FF3E04EF0A5BC40">The &s;oldier, without any he&s;itation, agreed to this; upon which his health was drank, and he be|came better acquainted with his <HI>new</HI> friends, for notwith&s;tanding their occupation, he thought there was &s;ome honor among them, it being their &s;worn rule to make depredations only, but never commit murder, if avoidable; this was certainly evident in their behaviour to him&mdash;for doubtle&s;s they could have de&s;troyed him without fear of di&s;covery, in&s;tead of which, they preferred rather making him their friend, and even giving up to him their convenient re&s;idence.</P>
<P>The next morning, the &s;oldier's friends were very anxious to know his &s;ucce&s;s: he amu&s;ed them with a humorous fictitious tale that the &s;pirit (which was a <HI>&s;pirited</HI> one indeed) confe&s;&s;ed, upon being interro|gated three times, that he was unea&s;y, on account of &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s he had omitted doing before he had died, the performance of which would render him now happy, and he would re&s;t for ever. "I offered my &s;ervices," added the &s;on of Mars&mdash;"Thank you," cried he, "you are a very good fellow;"&mdash;then he told me what it was, which being enjoined to keep &s;ecret, I cannot po&s;&s;ibly reveal; in fourteen days time, however, I &s;hall be able to accompli&s;h it, and then, I flatter my&s;elf, I &s;hall have quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my hou&s;e at an ea&s;y rent; in order to effect the lat|ter, he went and made his bargain &s;ure with the landlord. About the expiration of a fortnight, he went to his hou&s;e, but fir&s;t of all, paid a vi&s;it to the apartment that was under ground; he &s;oon di&s;cover|ed the door&mdash; he opened it, but the tenants were gone; on the table, there was a letter for him, re|turning him hearty and &s;incere thanks for the hon|orable adherence he ob&s;erved to his oath &mdash; as a requital for which, a bill for an hundred pounds was enclo&s;ed; this, thought the &s;oldier, will be great help toward <HI>hou&s;ekeeping.</HI></P>
<P>His family now came to congratulate him, among
<PB N="10" REF="032623_0009_0FF3E050C039E838">
whom was an old &s;uper&s;titious woman, who hoped he was perfectly convinced that there were &s;uch things as gho&s;ts and apparitions.</P>
<P>"No," cried our hero, "I am not convinced yet."</P>
<P>They all wondered at his incredulity, but more &s;o, when they heard the real &s;tory, and were admitted to the &s;ecret apartment, which was demon&s;tration &s;ufficient of its truth: herein they made merry, and drank a health to the new owner.</P>
<P>After a few months quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, this happy and uninterrupted tenant received the following brief, but plea&s;ing note, from one of his predece&s;&s;ors:
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>"Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>In the hurry and confu&s;ion of our leaving tho&s;e under-apartments, which we occupied in your hou&s;e, either without permi&s;&s;ion or the knowledge of the owner, we omitted taking away a &s;mall box that con|tains &s;ome bags of gold; you are certainly entitled to the &s;ame for having &s;o honorably kept your word, which you may find under a &s;tone that is marked B. G. 111.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Yours, &amp;c."</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>Our &s;urpri&s;ed hero immediately examined the place that was refered to, where he found the box as de&s;cribed, containing three bags, with fifty guineas each; thus, by courage and per&s;everance, he obtain|ed a dwelling on moderate terms, and a &s;ufficiency to pay his rent for &s;everal &s;ucceeding quarters.</P>

<HEAD>Remarkable Anecdotes of Dr. YOUNG, Author of "The Night Thoughts."</HEAD>
<P>DR. Young was rector of Welwyn, in Hertford|&s;hire; a living worth about five hundred pounds per annum; and though he was in the blaze of court favour, he never had the fortune to ri&s;e to greater preferment. Indeed, during the la&s;t reign, poetry or real eloquence was but little promoted or encour|aged from the throne.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="032623_0010_0FF3E05365556F20">When the Doctor was pretty far advanced in life, he married the lady Elizabeth Lee, daughter of the late Earl of Litchfield. This lady was a widow, and had two children, a &s;on and a daughter, who were both very de&s;erving, but both died young and in a &s;hort time of each other. What he felt for their lo&s;s as well as for that of his wife, we may ea&s;ily per|ceive by his fine poem of the Night Thoughts, in which they are characterized, the young lady under the name of Narci&s;&s;a, her brother by that of Philan|der, and his wife, though namele&s;s, is frequently alluded to. He thus regrets his lo&s;s in his apo&s;tro|phe to death.</P>
<Q><L>In&s;atiate Archer, could not one &s;uffice?</L>
<L>Thy &s;haft flew thrice, and thrice my peace was &s;lain,</L>
<L>And thrice, ere thrice yon moon renew'd her horn.</L></Q>
<P>Of Dr. Young's tragedies, the <HI>Revenge</HI> is the be&s;t. This play met with very great &s;ucce&s;s. The de&s;ign of it &s;eems to have been borrowed partly from Shake&s;pear's Othello, and partly from Mrs. Behn's Abdallazar; the plot bearing many marks of the former; and the principal character Zanga, of the latter. Yet it will not &s;urely be &s;aying too much, when we affirm that Dr. Young has in many re&s;pects improved his originals. If we compare the Iago in one, with the Zanga in the other tragedy, we &s;hall find the motives of re&s;entment greatly different, and tho&s;e of Young much more ju&s;tly as well as more nobly founded, than tho&s;e of Shake&s;pear. Iago's cau&s;e of re&s;entment again&s;t Othello, is only his hav|ing &s;et a younger officer over his head, and on a particular and &s;ingle vacancy, notwith&s;tanding he him&s;elf has rea&s;on to expect a po&s;t of equal advan|tage. To this is added, a &s;light &s;u&s;picion of Othello's having been too intimate with his wife. But Zanga's cau&s;e of anger is quite different. The death of his father, &s;lain by Alonzo, the lo&s;s of a kingdom in
<PB N="12" REF="032623_0011_0FF3E055D4772A90">
con&s;equence of his &s;ucce&s;s, and the indignity of a blow received from the &s;ame hand; all the&s;e accu|mulated injuries, added to the impo&s;&s;ibility of find|ing a noble means of revenge, urge him, again&s;t his will, to the more &s;ub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le and underhand methods he employs. Othello's jealou&s;y is rai&s;ed by trifles, and by appearing too credulous, he forfeits that pity which his di&s;tre&s;&s;es would otherwi&s;e demand. Alon|zo, on the contrary, long &s;truggles again&s;t conviction, nor proceeds to extremities, till he finds <HI>proofs ri&s;e on proofs, and &s;till the la&s;t the &s;tronge&s;t.</HI> In a word, we may a&s;&s;ign this piece with great ju&s;tice, a place in the very fir&s;t rank of dramatic writings, and were we to &s;hew foreigners a tragedy as a &s;ample of Eng|li&s;h genius, after two or three others, we &s;hould produce the Revenge, written by Dr. Young, as a &s;pecimen.</P>
<P>As a poet, the Doctor was con&s;idered as the only palladium of ancient genius; and as a Chri&s;tian, one of the fine&s;t examples of primeval piety. The turn of his mind was naturally &s;olemn, and he u&s;ually, when at home in the country, &s;pent many hours of the day walking in his own church-yard among the tombs. His conver&s;ation, his writings, had all a reference to the life after this; and this turn of di&s;|po&s;ition mixed it&s;elf even with his improvements in gardening. He had, for in&s;tance, an alcove with a bench &s;o painted near his hou&s;e, that at a di&s;tance it looked like a real one, which the &s;pectator was then approaching. Upon coming up near it, the decep|tion was perceived, and this motto appeared:
<Q>Invi&s;ibilia non decipiunt.</Q>
Tran&s;lated,
<Q>The things un&s;een do not deceive us.</Q>
Yet, nowith&s;tanding this gloomine&s;s of temper, he was fond of innocent &s;ports and amu&s;ements; he in&s;tituted an a&s;&s;embly and a bowling-green in his pari&s;h, and often promoted the gaiety of the com|pany in per&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="032623_0012_0FF3E059484084B0">His wit was very poignant, and always levelled at tho&s;e who expre&s;&s;ed any contempt for decency and religion. His epigram &s;poken extempore on Vol|taire, is well known, who happening in his company to ridicule Milton, and the allegorical per&s;onage of Death and Sin; Young thus addre&s;&s;ed him:
<Q><L>Thou art &s;o witty, profligate, and thin,</L>
<L>You &s;eem a Milton with his Death and Sin.</L></Q></P>
<P>When he fir&s;t publi&s;hed his admirable Night Thoughts, either through mode&s;ty, or for &s;ome other rea&s;on, he cho&s;e to conceal his name as the author, and publi&s;hed them in numbers. Sir Jeremy Sam|brooke, a Baronet of great integrity, and remarka|ble for his ho&s;pitality, lived about &s;even miles from the Doctor, but &s;o great was their intimacy, that the Doctor u&s;ed daily, when the weather permitted, to dine at Sir Jeremy's table. The Baronet was totally blind, yet very facetious, and a competent judge of men and books. He employed his nephew, who re&s;ided in London, to &s;end him down weekly, all the new publications. Among others, the fir&s;t number of the Night Thoughts made its appearance. Sir Jeremy de&s;ired Dr. Young would read it, which he accordingly did, and we may be &s;ure with great propriety, as none can read works better than the authors of them. The approbation of the company was te&s;tified in an extraordinary manner, and they were all very de&s;irous of knowing the author; &s;ome little time afterwards Dr. Young left the room to walk in the garden. Upon which Lady Judy Sam|brooke &s;aid, "Brother, I believe I have found out the author of that excellent piece of poetry the Doc|tor has been reading." "Ah, &s;i&s;ter Judy," &s;aid Sir Jeremy, "how came you to be &s;o much before-hand with us in your di&s;coveries; pray, who is the author?"

<HEAD>In&s;tance of FEMALE HEROISM, and the Mode of treating Women in &s;ome Countries.</HEAD>
<P>THE kingdom of Gurrat in Hindo&s;tan was gov|erned by queen Dargocette, eminent for &s;pirit and beauty. Small as that kingdom is, it contain|ed about &s;eventy thou&s;and towns and villages, the effect of long peace and pro&s;perity. Being invaded by A&s;aph Can, not many years ago, the queen mounted on an elephant, led her troops to battle. Her &s;on Rajah Bier Shaw, being wounded in the heat of action, was by her orders carried from the field. That accident having occa&s;ioned a general panic, the queen was left with no more than three hundred hor&s;emen. Adhar, who conducted her elephant, exhorted her to retire, while it could be done with &s;afety. The heroine rejected the advice. "It is true," &s;aid &s;he, "we are overcome in battle; but not in honour. Shall I, for a lingering ignomin|ious life, lo&s;e a reputation that has been my chief &s;tudy! Let your gratitude repay now the obligations you owe me: pull out your dagger, and &s;ave me from &s;lavery, by putting an end to my life."</P>

poor creatures are &s;uffered to toil in the fields and woods, ready to faint with exce&s;&s;ive labour, while the mon&s;ters of men will not give them&s;elves even the trouble of training animals for work, though they have the example of the Portugue&s;e before their eyes.</P>
<P>It is the bu&s;ine&s;s of the women among the wan|dering Arabs of Africa, to card, &s;pin, and weave, and to manage other hou&s;hold affairs. They milk the cattle, grind, bake, brew, dre&s;s the victuals, and bring home wood and water. They even take care of their hu&s;bands' hor&s;es, feed, curry, comb, bridle and &s;addle them. They would al&s;o, like Moori&s;h wives, be obliged to dig, &s;ow, and reap their corn, but luckily for them, the Arabs live entirely upon plunder. Father Jo&s;eph Gumilla, in his account of a country in South America, bordering upon the great river Oronooko, de&s;cribes pathetically the mi&s;erable &s;lavery of married women there, and men|tions a practice that would appear incredible to one unacquainted with the manners of that country; which is, that married women frequently de&s;troy their female infants. A married woman of a vir|tuous character and a good under&s;tanding, having been guilty of that crime, was reproached by our author in very bitter terms. She heard him patient|ly to the end of his di&s;cour&s;e with eyes fixed on the ground, and an&s;wered as follows: "I wi&s;h to God. Sir, I wi&s;h to God, that my mother had by my death, prevented the manifold di&s;tre&s;&s;es I have endured, and have yet to endure as long as I live. Had &s;he kindly &s;tifled me at my birth, I &s;hould not have felt the pain of death, nor numberle&s;s other pains to which life hath &s;ubjected me. Con&s;ider, father, our deplorable condition. Our hu&s;bands go out to hunt with their bows and arrows, and trouble them&s;elves no farther. We are dragged along with one infant at our brea&s;t, and another in a ba&s;ket. They return in the evening without any burthen; we return

with the burthen of our children; and though tired out with a long march, are not permitted to &s;leep, but mu&s;t labour the whole night in grinding maize to make chica for them. They get drunk, and in their drunkenne&s;s they beat us, draw us by the hair of the head, and tread us under foot. And what have we to comfort us for &s;lavery, perhaps of twenty years? A young wife is brought in upon us, who is permitted to abu&s;e us and our children, becau&s;e we are no longer regarded. Can human nature endure &s;uch tyranny? What kindne&s;s can we &s;hew to our female children, equal to that of delivering them from &s;uch &s;ervitude, more bitter a thou&s;and times than death?

<P>One would imagine, that the women of that country &s;hould have the greate&s;t abhorrence of mat|rimony; but all-prevailing nature determines the contrary, and the appetite for matrimony overbal|ances every rational con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Upon a review of &s;uch conduct as this, how hap|py &s;hould Engli&s;h women think them&s;elves, who&s;e condition is &s;o much the rever&s;e from that of tho&s;e poor wretches.

<HEAD>Savage Manners, and a remarkable In&s;tance of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Barbarity.</HEAD>
<P>HERODOTUS &s;ays, that a Scythian pre&s;ents the King with the heads of the enemies he has killed in battle; and the man who does not bring a head, gets no &s;hare of the plunder. He adds, that many Scythians clothe them&s;elves with the &s;kins

Diodorus Siculus reports of the Gauls, that they carry home the heads of their ene|mies &s;lain in battle; and after embalming them, depo&s;it them in che&s;ts as their chief trophy, bragg|ing of the &s;ums offered for the&s;e heads by the friends of the decea&s;ed, and refu&s;ed.</P>
<P>No &s;avages were more cruel than the Greeks and Trojans, as de&s;cribed by Homer; men were butch|ered in cold blood, towns were reduced to a&s;hes, &s;overeigns were expo&s;ed to the mo&s;t humiliating indignities, and no re&s;pect was paid to age or &s;ex. The young Adra&s;tus thrown from his car, and lying in his face in the du&s;t, obtained quarter from Mene|laus. Agamemnon upbraided his brother for leni|ty: "Let none from de&s;truction e&s;cape," &s;aid he, "not even the li&s;ping infant in the mother's arms: all her &s;ons mu&s;t with Illium fall, and on her ruins unburied remain." He pierced the &s;uppliant with his &s;pear, and &s;etting his foot on the body pulled it out.</P>
<P>Hector having &s;tript Patroclus of his arms, drags the &s;lain along, vowing to lop the head from the trunk, and to give the mangled cor&s;e a prey to the dogs of Troy. And the 17th book of the Illiad is wholly employed in de&s;cribing the conte&s;t about the body, between the Greeks and the Trojans.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the brutality of preventing the la&s;t duties from being performed to a dead friend, it is a low &s;cene, unworthy of heroes. It was equally brutal in Achilles, to drag the cor&s;e of Hector to the &s;hips, tied to his car. In a &s;cene between Hector and And|romache, the treatment of vanqui&s;hed enemies is pathetically de&s;cribed; &s;overeigns ma&s;&s;acred and their bodies lef<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a prey to dogs and vultures; &s;ucking infants da&s;hed again&s;t the pavement; ladies of the fir&s;t rank forced to perform the lowe&s;t acts of &s;lavery.

As a puni&s;hment for bringing rational creatures into exi&s;tence, the gods decree, that he be chained to a rock and aban|doned to birds of prey.

Who but an American &s;avage, can now be|hold &s;uch a &s;pectacle, without being &s;hocked at it! A &s;cene repre&s;enting a woman murdered by her children would be hi&s;&s;ed by every modern audience, and yet that horrid &s;cene was repre&s;ented with ap|plau&s;e in the Electra of Sophocles.

<P>The Greeks are the le&s;s excu&s;able for their cruel|ty, as they appear to have been &s;en&s;ible, that hu|manity is a cardinal virtue. Barbarians are always painted by Homer, as cruel; poli&s;hed nations as tender and compa&s;&s;ionate.</P>

<P>Madam Lapouchin, the great ornament of the court of Peter&s;burg, during the reign of the Empre&s;s Elizabeth, having contracted an intimacy with a foreign amba&s;&s;ador, was brought under &s;u&s;picion of plotting with him again&s;t the government, and was accordingly condemned to undergo the puni&s;h|ment of the knout. At the place of execution &s;he appeared in a genteel undre&s;s, which heightened her beauty.

Her youth al&s;o, her beauty, her life and &s;pirit pleaded for her. But all in vain: &s;he was de&s;erted by all, and abandoned to &s;urly executioners, whom &s;he beheld with a&s;toni&s;hment, &s;eeming to doubt whether &s;uch preparations were intended for her. The cloak that covered her bo|&s;om being pulled off, mode&s;ty took the alarm, and made her &s;tart back: &s;he turned pale, and bur&s;t into tears. One of the executioners &s;tripped her naked to the wai&s;t, &s;eized her by both hands, and threw her on his back, rai&s;ing her &s;ome inches from the ground. The other executioner laying hold of her delicate limbs with his rough fi&s;ts, put her in a po&s;ture for receiving the puni&s;hment. Then laying hold of the knout, a &s;ort of whip made of a leather &s;trap, 'he retreated a few &s;teps, and with a &s;ingle &s;troke tore off a &s;lip of &s;kin from the neck down|ward, repeating his &s;trokes till all the &s;kin of her back was cut off in &s;mall &s;lips.

<HEAD>Anecdote of Mon&s;ieur THUROT.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN Mon&s;. Thurot, during our late war with France, appeared on the coa&s;t of Scotland with three armed ve&s;&s;els, the terror he at fir&s;t &s;pread, &s;oon yielded to admiration, in&s;pired by his human|ity. He paid a full price for every thing he want|ed; and in general behaved with &s;o much affability, that a countryman ventured to complain to him of an officer who had taken from him fifty or &s;ixty guineas. The officer acknowledged the fact; but &s;aid, that he had divided the money among his men. Thurot ordered the officer to give his bill for the money, which he &s;aid, &s;hould be &s;topped out of his pay, if they were &s;o fortunate as to return to France. Compare this incident with that of the great Scipio, celebrated in Roman &s;tory, who re&s;tored a beautiful bride to the bridegroom, and it will not &s;uffer by the compari&s;on. Another in&s;tance is no le&s;s re|markable. One of his officers gave a bill upon a merchant in France, for the price of provi&s;ions pur|cha&s;ed by him. Thurot having accidentally &s;een the bill, informed the countryman, that it was of no value, reprimanded the officer bitterly for the cheat, and compelled him to give a bill upon a merchant
<PB N="21" REF="032623_0020_0FF3E06E881EE738">
whom he knew would pay the money. At that very time, Thurot's men were in bad humour, and were di&s;po&s;ed to mutiny. In &s;uch circum&s;tances, would not Thurot have been excu&s;ed, for winking at a fraud to which he was not acce&s;&s;ary? But he acted all along with the &s;tricte&s;t honour, even at the hazard of a mutiny. Common hone&s;ty to an enemy is not a common practice in war. Thurot was &s;trictly hone&s;t in circum&s;tances that made the exertion of common hone&s;ty an act of the highe&s;t magnanimity. The&s;e incidents ought to be held up to princes as examples of true heroi&s;m. War car|ried on in that manner, would, from de&s;olation and horror, be converted into a fair field for acquiring true military glory, and for exerci&s;ing every manly virtue.</P>
<P>This great man will be kept in remembrance by every true-hearted Briton; though he died fighting again&s;t us. But he died in the field of honour, fighting for his country.</P>
<P>The policy of the Greeks and Romans in war, was to weaken the &s;tate by de&s;troying its people. Humanity with us prevails even in war. Individu|als not in arms are &s;ecure, which &s;aves much inno|cent blood. Pri&s;oners were formerly &s;et at liberty by paying a ran&s;om, and by later improvements in manners, even that practice is left off, as too mer|cantile, and a more honourable one is in&s;tituted, that of exchanging pri&s;oners. Humanity was car|ried to a &s;till greater height in our late war with France, by an agreement between the Duke de Noailles and the Earl of Stair, that the ho&s;pitals for the &s;ick and wounded &s;oldiers &s;hould be free from all ho&s;tiliti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s. When the French troops were com|pelled to abandon their conque&s;ts in the electorate of Hanover, their Generals every where burnt their magazines and plundered their people.

<P>THE Marquis De F. was on the point of being married. He called at Dr. M's lodgings in Paris a few days ago.

He then &s;aid that the old Marquis de R. his mi&s;tre&s;s's father, had waited on his mother, and after ten thou&s;and apologies and circumlocutions, had given her to under&s;tand that certain things had intervened, which rendered it impo&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould ever have the honour of being father-in-law to her &s;on, and reque&s;ted her to inform him, how infinitely ea&s;y he and all his family were, at an incident which deprived them of the plea&s;ure they had expected from that connection. His mother, he &s;aid, had endeavoured to di&s;cover the incident which had produced this alteration, but to no purpo&s;e. The old gentleman contented him|&s;elf with a&s;&s;uring her that the particulars would be equally di&s;agreeable and &s;uperfluous, and then took

his leave in the mo&s;t polite and affectionate terms that the French language could furni&s;h him with.</P>
<P>The Marquis de F. told Dr. M. this with an air &s;o ea&s;y and contented, that the Doctor did not well know what to make of it. My dear Marquis, &s;aid he, it is fortunate that I have been mi&s;taken, for you mu&s;t know I had taken it into my head that you were fond of the lady.

<P>My mother, added he, who is the be&s;t creature in the world, and whom I love with all my &s;oul, told me this marriage would make her quite happy.

<P>AT a certain parade where the Sovereign him&s;elf was pre&s;ent, and many officers a&s;&s;embled, a corpulent general officer &s;uddenly &s;tarted, as if he had &s;een &s;omething preternatural. He immediately waddled towards the ranks with all the expedition of a terrified gander. It was &s;urpri&s;ing to the &s;pec|tators, what had put his excellency into a commo|tion &s;o little &s;uitable to his years and habit of body. While they were on tip-toe to ob&s;erve the i&s;&s;ue of this phaenomenon, he arrived at the ranks, and in great wrath, which probably had been augmented by the heat acquired in his cour&s;e, he pulled off one of the &s;oldiers hats, which it &s;eems had not been properly cocked, and adju&s;ted it to his mind.

If any man her the a&s;&s;urance to prolong his prayer a minute longer than the drum indicates, he is puni&s;hed on the &s;pot, and taught to be le&s;s devout in future. The ingenious inventor of drums certainly never dreamt of their becoming the regulators of people's piety.

<HEAD>Revenge of a Tobacconi&s;t, as related by Dr. M.</HEAD>
<P>AS I was riding one day along the banks of the Maine, near the village of Heix, which is in the territory of the elector of Mentz, I ob&s;erved a building which &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">emed to be the re&s;idence of &s;ome prince or bi&s;hop at lea&s;t. I was &s;urpri&s;ed I never had heard it &s;poken of, as it had a more magnificent appearance than any modern building I had &s;een in Germany. I rode up, and upon entering it, found that the apartments within (though not laid out in the be&s;t ta&s;te) &s;eemed to corre&s;pond in point of expence with the external appearance.</P>
<P>I was informed by the workmen, who were em|ployed in fini&s;hing the&s;e apartments, that this pal|ace belonged to a Tobacconi&s;t in Frankfort, where he &s;till kept a &s;hop, and had accumulated a prodi|gious fortune by making and &s;elling &s;nuff.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="032623_0030_0FF3E088D936BE10">Near to the principal hou&s;e is another great build|ing intended for a workhou&s;e, in which tobacco is to be manufactured, with many apartments for the workmen, and vaulted cellars in which the various kinds of &s;nuff are to be kept moi&s;t, till &s;ent for in|land &s;ale to Frankfort, or &s;hipped at the Maine for foreign markets.</P>
<P>The owner informed me, that there were exactly three hundred rooms in both buildings, and the greater number of the&s;e belonged to the dwelling-hou&s;e. I did not chu&s;e to puzzle the man by diffi|cult que&s;tions, and therefore refrained from inqui|ring what u&s;e he intended to make of &s;uch an ama|zing number of rooms, which &s;eemed rather con|trived as barracks for two or three thou&s;and &s;oldiers, than for any other purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>When I returned to town I was informed, that this per&s;on is not a native of Frankfort, though he has been many years e&s;tabli&s;hed there, and had ap|plied to the magi&s;trates for liberty to purcha&s;e a certain &s;pot of ground, on which he propo&s;ed to build a dwelling-hou&s;e, &amp;c. which cannot be done without the con&s;ent of the magi&s;trates. This be|ing refu&s;ed, he bought a piece of land in the territo|ry of Mentz, immediately beyond that of Franck|fort, and on the banks of the Maine; and being highly piqued by the refu&s;al he had met with from the magi&s;trates, he reared a building greatly larger and more exten&s;ive than was nece&s;&s;ary, or than he fir&s;t intended, in full per&s;ua&s;ion that the remor&s;e of the magi&s;trates would be in proportion to the &s;ize of his fabric.

<P>A lady who&s;e education had been neglected in her youth, and who had arrived at a very ripe age with|out perceiving any inconvenience from the accident, had obtained by the intere&s;t of &s;ome of her relations, a place at the court of Brun&s;wick. She had not been there long before &s;he perceived that the con|ver&s;ation in the Duche&s;s' apartments frequently turned upon &s;ubjects of which &s;he was intirely ig|norant, and that tho&s;e ladies had mo&s;t of her Royal Highne&s;s' ear who were be&s;t acquainted with books. She regreted for the fir&s;t time, the neglect of her own education, and although &s;he had hitherto con|&s;idered that kind of knowledge, which is derived from reading as unbecoming a woman of quality, yet as it was now fa&s;hionable at court &s;he re&s;olved to &s;tudy hard, that &s;he might get on the top of the mode as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible.

Why, Sir, I am in|formed, that your wor&s;hip, not having a right &s;en&s;e of things, nor the fear of God before your eyes, &s;hould (to the di&s;grace of your own virtue) give your tongue liberty in an open coffee-hou&s;e to &s;peak ill of the gout.

But to prove its divine original, I will proceed more methodically, and from his lowe&s;t commendations a&s;cend to his highe&s;t by &s;ix degrees, till I have rai&s;ed him above the &s;tars, and entered him among the cele&s;tial &s;pirits, to whom, Sir, you will then be tempted to offer up your ori&s;ons in the pre&s;cribed form, at the end of an old manu&s;cript-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;&s;al, communicated to me by a learned antiquary.

&s;hall be my voucher, who di&s;&s;ected the body of the learned, reverend, and pious Dr. Hammond, killed purely by his friend, who unhappily taught him a medicine to cure the gout; upon the &s;ucce&s;s of that medicine, the Doctor's old <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ephritic</HI> pains returned, and in a fortnight di&s;patched him.</P>
<P>Therefore, Sir, for your own &s;ake, for your lady's &s;ake, and for your children's &s;ake, welcome the gout to your hou&s;e, and if you &s;hut all the doors again&s;t the phy&s;ician, I will warrant you for upwards of a hundred. How glad &s;hall I be to &s;ee them pull chalk-&s;tones out of your wor&s;hip's feet, &s;ome forty or fifty years hence; by that time you will have learned &s;o much patience as never to roar for the matter. But if you do roar, they who look on, if they love life, will envy, not pity you. Indeed you are already a fit object for the envy of thinking men, for I have heard you confe&s;s, that your's is an hered|itary gout, and that is for the better; an hereditary gout is a far greater happine&s;s than an acquired one; what a deal of intemperance, and amorous exce&s;&s;es might it have co&s;t your wor&s;hip to have got the gout before forty? Whereas now you have got the mighty ble&s;&s;ing for nothing; it is your birth-right, Sir; never think of parting with it.</P>
<P>Second, The gout is no con&s;tant companion, but allows his patient lucid joyous intervals.</P>
<P>Human nature is &s;o framed, that no one thing is agreeable to it always, therefore it is well for us that the world is &s;o full of changes; the earth we tread on, the &s;eas we &s;ail on, the air we breathe in, the &s;tarry firmament expanded round us, have their con|tinual vici&s;&s;itudes which make all for our advantage and delight. How welcome is a gue&s;t that knows when to be gone? But, if his &s;tay be longer than ordinary, we are ready to thru&s;t him out of doors. Whatever &s;ome impatient weak minds may think, it is manife&s;t, that the gout, by his coming and going, takes the right cour&s;e to be very agreeable and obli|ging.
<PB N="38" REF="032623_0037_0FF3E09D1D660810">
Weak people may cur&s;e the gout, and wi&s;h to be wholly excu&s;ed from his intermitting vi&s;its; but I look upon &s;uch people, as men who are weary of the world, and being willing to leave it, I grant they have rea&s;on to be angry with the gout, that folds their mortality &s;o fa&s;t about them.</P>
<P>Courage, Sir, and be advi&s;ed by me, it is good advice I am giving, and you &s;hall have it gratis. When your foot &s;wells, and burns, and throbs, ban|i&s;h all fooli&s;h &s;orrow and repining; in&s;tead whereof, let &s;welling joys dilate your generous brea&s;t; when &s;harp fermenting juices &s;hall meet, and by their fu|rious conte&s;t cau&s;e cruel twitchings of your nervous fibres, comfort your heart and be extremely plea&s;ed; but touch not, ta&s;te not the Doctor's emul&s;ions, julips, &amp;c. &s;o let your friend the gout take his cour&s;e and maul you &s;oundly. O! &s;o ea&s;y, &s;o plea&s;ed, &s;o joy|ous, &s;o happy, &s;o ble&s;&s;ed will you be, when the turn of health &s;hall come; why, Sir, you will be in hea|ven, while you are on earth; you will be entirely beatified on this &s;ide the grave. I am of opinion, Sir, that you are nearly converted to my &s;entiments already, but for fear that you are not a complete pro&s;elyte, I will proceed to the third head; I have no doubt, before I have done with you, to make you rather part with your eyes than your true friend.</P>
<P>Third, The gout pre&s;ents you with a perpetual almanack; and that it never may be out of the way, but ready always for your wor&s;hip's u&s;e, &s;afely depo&s;its it in the <HI>internodia</HI> of your bones. Barom|eters, thermometers, and others the inventions of men, not yet perfect ma&s;ters of their arts, &s;erve more for the delight, than the u&s;e of the curious; but the u&s;eful pains of the gout, give your honour tru&s;ty progno&s;tics of the &s;ea&s;on. As often as a moi&s;t con|&s;titution of the year, &s;outh or north winds, or &s;now are at hand, you predict tho&s;e things from the ex|ce&s;&s;es of your pains; and by the ab&s;ence of your pains, you forbode the contrary; &s;o one way or other your <HI>bone almanack</HI> &s;erves for all changes.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="032623_0038_0FF3E09F236C67B8">Fourth, Gouty per&s;ons are mo&s;t free from the head-ach.</P>
<P>The heavy recrement of the blood and nervous juice, always fall downwards to the gouty joints. Per&s;ons much favoured by the gout, upon every long ab&s;ence of that be&s;t friend, (whether occa&s;ioned by unknown accidents, or unwi&s;e recour&s;es to the Doctor) exchange their freedom from the gout, for pain more inten&s;e and dangerous; but of all other pains, they are extremely &s;ubject to the head-ach; but as &s;oon as ever the g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut plea&s;es to re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;it them, (forgiving their ingratitude) pre&s;ently the weather breaks up, the nerves are relaxed, the &s;ibres unmo|le&s;ted, the membranes and mu&s;cles recover their right tone, while the inimicous conte&s;ting particles are thrown down to the remote parts of the body.</P>
<P>Fifth, The gout pre&s;erves its patients from the great danger of fevers.</P>
<P>Gouty per&s;ons, as they live free from the dreadful pains of the head-ach, &s;o likewi&s;e from the &s;corch|ing heat of fevers. There is not certainly a &s;everer torment than a burning fever, nor a more &s;overeign antidote than the medicinal gout; &s;o that it is a truth clear as the &s;un, if more people had the gout, fewer would die of a fever. Having placed the&s;e things in a light &s;o forcible, I am &s;trongly per&s;uaded that not your wor&s;hip only, but the generality of the age will put their prejudice a&s;ide, and yield to the truth here a&s;certained; and in&s;tead of the old parting compliments, "<HI>Save you, Sir; God keep you in good health</HI>" &mdash; I que&s;tion not but we &s;hall &s;ay, "<HI>The gout d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">d you, Sir; God give you the gout</HI> &mdash;" for we ought not to hope for a ble&s;&s;ing without the means. To wi&s;h a man the gout, is to wi&s;h him that which withdraws fuel from di&s;ea&s;es, and pre|&s;erves life at &s;o cheap a rate, it co&s;ts a man nothing but patience.</P>
<P>It has been the opinion of &s;ome writers, that none can be &s;aved who die of the plague; but in judging
<PB N="40" REF="032623_0039_0FF3E0A11059DE08">
of the future &s;tate of others, I think it be&s;t to ven|ture being mi&s;taken on the charitable &s;ide; and therefore I would &s;ooner believe, that none can be damned who have the gout; and I mu&s;t tell your wor&s;hip, that I have known a le&s;s probable &s;ign of &s;alvation given by a clergyman to his hearers.</P>
<P>Sixth, To crown the honour of the gout, it is not to be cured.</P>
<P>The gout defies all your gro&s;s Galenical methods, and all your exalted chymical preparations; for the conjunct cau&s;es thereof lie in parts &s;o very remote, that the virtues of no medicines can reach them, and Heaven be prai&s;ed for it; for why, Sir, would you cure (as you call it) the gout, which gives you pain without danger; a better ta&s;te of health by an acquaintance with pain, a knowledge of future things, freedom from the head-ach, and from &s;evers? I hope, my dear friend, you and I &s;hall be better advi&s;ed than to tamper with the gout, which really is not to be cured. The fear of lo&s;ing a ble&s;&s;ing, takes off from the plea&s;ure of enjoying it. Thieves may plunder your hou&s;e, age will ruin your beauty, envy may hurt your reputation, bribes corrupt your faith; but the gout is a &s;ure inheritance, neither thieves nor knaves, neither time nor envy, nor any thing el&s;e can deprive you of it. They &s;ay there is more care and trouble in keeping an e&s;tate than in getting it; as for the gout, there may be &s;ome trou|ble in getting it, though that is mixed with plea|&s;ure too; but no man is put to the lea&s;t care or trouble for the &s;afe keeping of the gout; he may endure mi&s;ery enough indeed, if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e went to the phy&s;ician for the cure of it. You cannot be always young and hand&s;ome, but gouty once, and gouty always, thence came the proverb, "<HI>Drink claret and have the gout; and drink no claret and &s;till have it.</HI>" The gout, it is true, is the reward of &s;om<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> works, but there is no forfeiting it; and therefore it is preferable to an imperial crown.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="032623_0040_0FF3E0A6B83DF6E8">Sir, I thought to have taken a larger view of the excellency of the g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut, but alas! the violent fit I have laboured under for the&s;e three &s;hort nights and days abates, the inten&s;ene&s;s of my pains con&s;id|erably remits, and therefore I am forced to break off abru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tly; for I am &s;en&s;ible that no man can do honor to the gout by a ju&s;t and adequate p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">negyric, but he who at the time of writing feels it in extremity.</P>

<P>IN Admiral Wat&s;on's &s;hip, at the &s;iege of Chan|dernagore, Captain Speke and his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, a youth of &s;ixteen, were both of them wounded by the &s;ame &s;hot.

Mr. Wat&s;on's heart was too full for a reply; he only ordered both to be carried down to the &s;urgeon. The Captain, who was fir&s;t brought down, told Mr.
<PB N="43" REF="032623_0042_0FF3E0AA53B6DC18">
Ives the &s;urgeon, how dangerou&s;ly his Billy had been wounded. Pre&s;ently after the brave youth ap|peared, with his eyes overflowing with tears, not for him&s;elf, but for his father. Upon Mr. Ives a&s;&s;uring him that his father's wound was not dan|gerous, he became c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lm, but refu&s;ed to be touched, till his father's wound was fir&s;t dre&s;&s;ed. Then point|ing to a fellow &s;ufferer, "Pray, Sir, dre&s;s al&s;o that poor man who is groaning &s;o &s;adly be&s;ide me." Mr. Ives told him that the man had been already taken care of, and begged that he now might have the liberty to examine his wound. He &s;ubmitted, and calmly &s;aid, "Sir, I fear you mu&s;t amputate above the joint." The &s;urgeon replied, "My dear, I mu&s;t." He cla&s;ped his hands together, and lifting up his eyes towards heaven, he offered up the following &s;hort, but earne&s;t petition: "Good God! do thou enable me to behave in my pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, worthy of my father." He then &s;aid he was all &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. The operation was performed above the joint of the knee; and during the whole time, the intrepid youth never &s;poke a word, nor uttered a groan that could be heard at the di&s;tance of a yard. It is ea&s;ier to imagine, than to expre&s;s the feelings of the father at this time: but whatever he felt, tears were the only expre&s;&s;ion. Both of them were carried to Calcutta: the father was lodged in the hou&s;e of his brother-in-law; and the &s;on was placed with the &s;urgeon in the ho&s;pital. For the fir&s;t week, comfort was given to them both, by car|rying good tidings of one another. But, alas! all the good &s;ymptoms that had attended the young man, began to di&s;appear. The Captain perceived all in the &s;urgeon's countenance; and &s;o very un|willing was he to add to the di&s;tre&s;s of the latter, as &s;eldom to &s;peak about his &s;on. One time he &s;aid, "How long, my friend, do you think my Billy may remain in a &s;tate of uncertainty?" Mr. Ives replied, "If he &s;urvives the fifteenth day after

of Montauban, in love with the wife of Gilles, bro|ther to the Duke, per&s;uaded the Duke that his bro|ther was laying plots to dethrone him. Gilles being impri&s;oned, the Duke's be&s;t friends conjured him to pity his unhappy brother, who might be impru|dent, but a&s;&s;uredly was innocent; but in vain. Gilles being pro&s;ecuted before the three e&s;tates of the province for high trea&s;on, was unanimou&s;ly ab&s;olved, which irritated the Duke more and more. Arthur of Montauban artfully &s;ugge&s;ted to his ma&s;ter to try poi&s;on; which having mi&s;carried, they next re&s;olved to &s;tarve the pri&s;oner to death. The un|fortunate prince, through the bars of a window, cried aloud for bread; but the pa&s;&s;engers dur&s;t not &s;upply him. One poor woman only had courage more than once, to &s;lip &s;ome bread within the win|dow. He charged a prie&s;t, who had received his confe&s;&s;ion, to declare to the Duke, "That &s;eeing ju&s;tice was refu&s;ed him in this world, he appealed to Heaven, and called upon the Duke to appear before the judgment &s;eat of God in forty days." The Duke and his favourite, amazed that the prince lived &s;o long without nouri&s;hment, employed a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;ins to &s;mother him in his bed-cloaths. The prie&s;t, in obedience to the orders he had received, pre&s;ent|ed him&s;elf before the Duke, and with a loud voice, cited him in the name of the decea&s;ed lord Gilles, to appear before God in forty days. Shame and re|mor&s;e verified the prediction. The Duke was &s;eized with a &s;udden terror; and the image of his brother, expiring by his orders, haunted him day and night. He decayed daily, without any marks of a regular di&s;ea&s;e, and died within the forty days, in frightful agony.</P>

This &s;eemed to make lit|tle impre&s;&s;ion at the time, but afterwards recurred often to this unhappy creature's memory, and be|came everyday more trouble&s;ome to his imagination.

<P>He would have put him&s;elf to death with his own hands, had he not been de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erred by the opinion, that God Almighty never forgives &s;uicide; though upon repentance he is very ready to pardon every other crime. He re&s;olved, therefore, to commit murder, that he might be deprived of life by the hand of ju&s;tice; and mingling a &s;entiment of ben|evolence with the cruelty of his intention, he reflec|ted, that if he murdered a grown per&s;on, he might po&s;&s;ibly &s;end a &s;oul to hell. To avoid this, he de|termined to murder a child, who could not have committed any &s;in which de&s;erved damnation, but dying in innocence, wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d go immediately to Hea|ven. In con&s;equence of the&s;e ideas, he actually murdered an infant of his ma&s;ter's, for whom he had always &s;hewn an uncommon degree of fondne&s;s.

<HEAD>Odd Way of bargaining for a Wife.</HEAD>
<P>MERCATOR, who went originally from Lon|don, acquired a fortune in the i&s;land of Jamaica; he concluded with him&s;elf he could not be happy in the enjoyment of it, unle&s;s he &s;hared it with a woman of merit; none of his acquaint|ance in the female line &s;uited his inclination; he therefore determined to write for one to his corre&s;|pondent in London, through who&s;e means he had obtained his fortune and con&s;equence. As he had been &s;o much ver&s;ed in mercantile matters, the &s;tile of writing u&s;ual in that way of bu&s;ine&s;s &s;till adhered to him.

<P>The London corre&s;pondent read over and over this odd commi&s;&s;ion, which put the future &s;pou&s;e on the &s;ame footing with the bales of goods he was to &s;end his friend. He neverthele&s;s complied with this ex|traordinary demand, and fixed his eyes upon a young per&s;on of a reputable family, but no fortune, of good humour, who had received a polite education, very well made, and more than tolerably hand&s;ome.

<HEAD>Anecdote of the late Duke of <HI>Montagu.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE late Duke of Montagu who re&s;ided in St. James's Park, frequently ob&s;erved a middle aged man in &s;omething like a military dre&s;s, of which the lace was much tarni&s;hed, and the cloth worn thread-bare; who always appeared at a certain hour in the mall. His countenance was grave and &s;olemn; and he took no notice of the gay croud that was pa&s;&s;ing by him.</P>
<P>The Duke &s;ingled him out as a fit object for a frolic. He began to exerci&s;e his mirth by inquiring into his hi&s;tory; he &s;oon learnt that he was a redu|ced officer upon half pay; that he had behaved with great bravery in the late war; that he had a wife and &s;everal children, whom he was obliged to &s;end into York&s;hire where they could live cheap; and that he had received a &s;mall pittance of his income to keep him&s;elf near the metropolis, where alone he could hope to obtain a more advantageous &s;ituation.</P>
<P>The Duke took an opportunity when the Captain was &s;itting alone upon one of the benches, buried in &s;peculation, to &s;end his gentleman to him with com|pliments and an invitation to dinner the next day. The Duke placed him&s;elf at a convenient di&s;tance, &s;aw his me&s;&s;enger approach without being perceived,

and begin to &s;peak without being heard; he &s;aw his intended gue&s;t &s;tart at the me&s;&s;age, and que&s;tion its authenticity. The Captain was at length per&s;uaded of its reality, though very much &s;urprized at its &s;ingularity. He returned thanks for the honour intended him, and &s;aid he would wait upon his grace at the time appointed.</P>
<P>He came, the Duke received him with great civil|ity, took him a&s;ide, and with an air of &s;ecrecy in|formed him, that he was induced to give him this invitation at the particular reque&s;t of a lady who had a mo&s;t tender regard for him. The Captain was confounded, and &s;eemed as if he did not know whether to receive it as an affront or a compliment. The Duke a&s;&s;ured him upon his honour, that he had told him nothing but the &s;tricte&s;t truth.</P>
<P>Dinner was announced. The Captain entered the room with great curio&s;ity and wonder, which was not dimini&s;hed, when he &s;aw at the table his own wife and children. The Duke began his frolic by &s;ending for them out of York&s;hire; which as much a&s;toni&s;hed the wife as the hu&s;band;&mdash; and took care &s;he &s;hould have no opportunity of &s;ending him a letter. This &s;udden unexpected meeting, produced very plea&s;ing effects: it afforded the Duke much &s;atisfaction; but it was with difficulty he got his gue&s;ts quietly &s;eated at table. Soon after dinner, word was brought that the Duke's &s;olicitor attended. He was introduced, and pulled out a deed for the Duke to &s;ign. He was de&s;ired to read it, and apol|ogized to the company for the interruption. The Captain and his wife were &s;till more a&s;toni&s;hed if po&s;&s;ible, when they found the writings contained a &s;ettlement of 200l. per annum upon them and their family. The in&s;trument was executed, and the Duke pre&s;ented it to the Captain, &s;aying, "Sir, I beg your acceptance of this. I a&s;&s;ure you it is the la&s;t thing I would have done, could I have laid out my money more to my &s;atisfaction."</P>

<HEAD>The GHOST.</HEAD>
<P>A London gentleman went to &s;ee his relations in the country. The hou&s;e was full, a wedding being celebrated there. Only one room was vacant. There no one cho&s;e to &s;leep, as it was &s;uppo&s;ed to be haunted. The London &s;park had no fear about him, and &s;aid he would &s;leep there. He fell a&s;leep. About three in the morning he was wakened by the opening of the door, and the entrance of a young woman in appearance, with only a night dre&s;s on her head, and her &s;hift on. This lovely appearance walked two or three times about the room, and at length laid it&s;elf down on the bed. The young gen|tleman did not much like his unknown bedfellow. He lay as far as he could on the other &s;ide. After &s;ome time he perceived his bedfellow breathe, and &s;uppo&s;ing her to be true fle&s;h and blood, and no phantom, he ventured to touch her. He was con|firmed in his opinion, and finding a ring on her finger, he gently took it off. She lay &s;ome time, and he did not di&s;turb her. She then got up, and went out of the room as &s;he came in. The young gentleman perceived how the room was haunted, by a female walking in her &s;leep. The morning came. The family were inqui&s;itive about him. He de&s;ired all the family might be &s;ummoned, when, lo! the ring fitted the elde&s;t daughter's finger, who had been in great tribulation about the lo&s;s. "This, Sir," &s;aid he to the father, "is the lovely &s;pirit which haunts the room." She declared her&s;elf per|fectly ignorant; but was convinced of its truth be|cau&s;e of the ring. "Well, Sir," &s;aid the father, "if you have no objection, &s;ince my daughter has been to bed to you, you &s;hall go to bed to my daugh|ter; and there is 5000l. for her portion." The match was that day con&s;ummated.</P>

<HEAD>A Character.</HEAD>
<P>VOLATILIS called at Serenus's lodgings a few &s;ummers ago. Serenus had remained in town merely becau&s;e he had no particular bu&s;ine&s;s el&s;ewhere; but Volatilis a&s;&s;ured him, that the town was a de&s;art; that it was &s;hameful to be &s;een in the &s;treets; that all the world were at Brighthelm&s;tone. Serenus allowed Volatilis to conduct him to that place, where they had remained only a few days, when the latter told the former, that none of the people he cared for were there; and as Serenus had nothing particular to detain him, Volatilis begged as a favour he would accompany him to Tunbridge. They went accordingly. Volatilis remained pretty quiet for four days; he yawned a good deal on the fifth, and the &s;ixth his jaws were nearly di&s;located. As he perceived Serenus was plea&s;ed with the place, and would take none of his hints about leaving it, he at la&s;t pretended that he had received a letter, which made it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for him to &s;et out for London, and away he went.</P>
<P>Serenus &s;tayed three weeks at Tunbridge. On his return to town, he under&s;tood that Volatilis had taken a genteel furni&s;hed hou&s;e for the remainder of the &s;ummer in York&s;hire, where he had already pa&s;&s;ed a week, having engaged a female friend to go along with him. He left word in town that he was not to be expected till the meeting of Parliament. Though Serenus never imagined that he would re|main quite &s;o long, yet he was a little &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee him enter his room a few days after he had re|ceived this information. He told Serenus he was quite di&s;gu&s;ted with his hou&s;e, and &s;till more &s;o with his companion; and be&s;ides, he had taken a violent fancy to go to Paris, which, &s;aid he, is the mo&s;t delightful place in the world, e&s;pecially in &s;ummer; for the company never think of rambling

about the country like our giddy fools in England; but remain together in the capital, as &s;en&s;ible peo|ple ought to do.</P>
<P>He then propo&s;ed that Serenus and him&s;elf &s;hould pack up a few things, take po&s;t, pa&s;s over and &s;pend a couple of months at Paris. Finding Ser<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nus did not reli&s;h the propo&s;al, he wrote an apology to the lady in York&s;hire, with an inclo&s;ed bank bill, and &s;et out next day by him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Serenus heard no more of him for &s;ix weeks, but at the end of that time, happening to be at Bath, &s;aw his friend Volatilis enter the pump room. Egad! &s;aid he, Serenus, you were wi&s;e to &s;tay at home; Paris is become the mo&s;t in&s;ipid place on earth, I could not &s;upport it above ten days. But having heard a good deal of Holland, I took a journey to Am&s;terdam, which between friends I found very little more amu&s;ing than Paris; two days after my arrival, finding an Engli&s;h &s;hip ready to &s;ail, I thought it would be a pity to let the opportunity &s;lip.

<HEAD>FRA. PASQUAL.</HEAD>
<P>IN a convent at Bologna, near Palermo, was for|merly a capuchin, known by the name of Fra. Pa&s;qual, who had pa&s;&s;ed through many &s;ingular &s;cenes of life, which it would be too long to recount. His la&s;t migration, or rather tran&s;migration, was from one of the banditti in this kingdom, in which capacity he had been enrolled for &s;ome time; but tired of the danger and fatigue, to which he was perpetually expo&s;ed, he at la&s;t determined to change the character of the hero, for that of the &s;aint, and try if it was not both &s;afer and &s;urer to rely on the weakne&s;s of others, than on our own &s;trength.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="032623_0055_0FF3E0CA16102D98">Fra. Pa&s;qual pretended a &s;trong compunction for the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of his pa&s;t life, and made a prom|i&s;e to the virgin, that the remainder of it &s;hould be &s;pent in mortification and penance, to atone for them. To this end, Pa&s;qual took the vows of pov|erty and cha&s;tity, and entered into all the rigours of the mona&s;tic life. For &s;ome weeks he behaved in a mo&s;t exemplary manner; he went barefooted, wore a large ro&s;ary, and thicker cord of di&s;cipline than any monk in the convent; and his whole deport|ment gave te&s;timony of the mo&s;t unfeigned repen|tance; however, the devil was &s;till at work in the heart of Fra. Pa&s;qual, and all the&s;e external morti|fications made him work the harder; in &s;hort, he found it impo&s;&s;ible to drive him out: Pa&s;qual was &s;en&s;ible of this; and afraid le&s;t the enemy &s;hould at la&s;t get the better of him, he thought it advi&s;eable to leave at Palermo the character of &s;anctity he had acquired, and begin &s;ome where el&s;e upon a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ew &s;core. He embarked for Naples, where he was &s;oon admitted into a capuchin convent.</P>
<P>As Pa&s;qual knew from experience that the dull uniformity of the mona&s;tic life required &s;ome little amu&s;ements to render it &s;upportable, the fir&s;t thing he &s;et about was to find a mi&s;tre&s;s. He made love to a lady of ea&s;y virtue, who &s;oon admitted his ad|dre&s;&s;es, but at the &s;ame time informed him, that he had a formidable rival, who was jealous as a tyger, and would not fail to put them both to death, &s;hould he di&s;cover the intrigue. This was no other than a life-guard man, a fellow of &s;ix feet two inches high, with a va&s;t &s;pada, like that of Goliah, and a mon&s;trous pair of curled whi&s;kers, that would ca&s;t a damp upon the heart of any one man but Fra. Pa&s;+qual; but the mona&s;tic life had not yet enervated him; he was accu&s;tomed to danger, and loved a few difficulties: however, as in his pre&s;ent charac|ter he could not be on a footing with his rival, he thought it be&s;t only to make u&s;e of prudence and
<PB N="57" REF="032623_0056_0FF3E0CE0632EA00">
&s;tratagem to &s;upplant him: The&s;e are the eccle&s;ia&s;t|ical arms, and they generally have been found too hard for the military.</P>
<P>The lady promi&s;ed him an interview, as &s;oon as the court &s;hould go to Portici, where the life-guard|man's duty obliged him to attend the King. Pa&s;qual waited with impatience for &s;ome time; at la&s;t the wi&s;hed for night arrived; the King &s;et off, after the opera, with all his guards. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;qual flew like lightning to the arms of his mi&s;tre&s;s; the prelimin|aries were &s;oon &s;ettled, and the happy lovers had ju&s;t fallen a&s;leep, when they were &s;uddenly alarmed by a rap and a well known voice at the door. The lady &s;tarted up in an agony of de&s;pair, a&s;&s;uring Pa&s;|qual that they were both undone; that this was her lover: and if &s;ome expedient was not fallen upon, in the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of his fury, he would certainly put them both to death. There was no time for reflection; the life-guard-man demanded entrance in the mo&s;t peremptory manner, and the lady was obliged to in&s;tant compliance. Pa&s;qual had ju&s;t time to gather his rags together, and cram him&s;elf below the bed; at that in&s;tant the door flew open, and the giant came in, rattling his arms and &s;torming at his mi&s;tre&s;s, for having made him wait &s;o long; however &s;he &s;oon pacified him. He then ordered her to &s;trike a light, that he might &s;ee to undre&s;s: This &s;truck Pa&s;qual to the &s;oul, and he gave him&s;elf up for lo&s;t; however, the lady's addre&s;s &s;aved him, when he lea&s;t expected it; in bringing the tinder, &s;he took care to let fall &s;ome water into the box; and all the beating &s;he and her lover could beat, they could not produce one &s;park. Every &s;troke of the flint &s;ound|ed in Pa&s;qual's ears like his death knell; but when he heard the life guard-man &s;wearing at the tinder for not kindling, he began to conceive &s;ome hopes, and ble&s;&s;ed the fertile invention of woman. The lady told him he might ea&s;ily get a light at the guard, which was at no great di&s;tance. Pa&s;qual's heart

The lady her&s;elf was di&s;concerted; but quickly recovering, &s;he told him, it would be too long before &s;he could get dre&s;&s;ed; but advi&s;ed him to go to the corner of a neighbour|ing &s;treet, where there was a lamp burning before the Virgin Mary, who could have no objection to his lighting a candle at it. Pa&s;qual revived; but the &s;oldier declared he was too much fatigued with his walk, and would rather undre&s;s in the dark; he at the &s;ame time began to grope for a bottle of liquor which he knew &s;tood there.

The lady ob&s;erv|ing what he was about, made a &s;pring and got him the bottle, at the very in&s;tant he was within an inch of &s;eizing Pa&s;qual's head. The lady went to bed, and told her lover as it was a cold night, &s;he would warm his place for him. Pa&s;qual admired her ad|dre&s;s, and began to conceive &s;ome hopes of e&s;caping.</P>
<P>His &s;ituation was the mo&s;t irk&s;ome in the world; the bed was &s;o low, that he had not room to move; and when the great heavy life guard-man entered it, he found him&s;elf &s;queezed down to the ground. He lay trembling and &s;tifling his breath for &s;ome time, but found it ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible to &s;upport his &s;it|uation till morning; and indeed if he had, his clothes being &s;cattered about, mu&s;t infallibly di&s;|cover him: he therefore began to think of making his e&s;cape; but could not move without alarming his rival, who was now lying above him. At fir&s;t he thought of ru&s;hing &s;uddenly out, and throwing him&s;elf into the &s;treet; but this he di&s;dained, and on &s;econd thoughts, determined, to &s;eize the life guard-man's &s;word, and either put him to death, or make an honourable capitulation both for him|&s;elf and the lady. In the mid&s;t of the&s;e reflections

his rival began to &s;nore, and Pa&s;qual declares that no mu&s;ic was ever &s;o grateful to his &s;oul. He tried to &s;tir a little, and finding that it did not awake the enemy, he by degrees worked him&s;elf out of his pri&s;on. He immediately laid hold of the great &s;pa|da, when all his fears for&s;ook him, and he felt as bold as a lion. He now relinqui&s;hed the da&s;tardly &s;cheme of e&s;caping, and only thought how he be&s;t could retaliate on his rival for all that he had made him &s;uffer.</P>
<P>As Pa&s;qual was &s;tark naked, it was no more trou|ble to him to put on the &s;oldier's clothes than his own; and as both his cloak and his cappouch toge|ther were not worth a &s;ixpence, he thought it mo&s;t eligible to equip him&s;elf <HI>a la militaire,</HI> and to leave his &s;acerdotal robes to the &s;oldier. In a &s;hort time he was dre&s;&s;ed <HI>cap-a-pee.</HI> His grea&s;y cowl, his cloak, his &s;andals, his ro&s;ary, and his rope of di&s;cipline, he gathered together, and placed on a chair before the bed, and girding him&s;elf with a great buff belt, in&s;tead of the cordon of St. Francis, and gra&s;ping his tru&s;ty toledo in&s;tead of the crucifix, he &s;allied forth into the &s;treet. He pondered for &s;ome time what &s;cheme to fall upon; and at fir&s;t thought of returning in the character of another life-guard|man, pretending to be &s;ent by the officer, with a guard in que&s;t of his companion, who not being found in his quarters, was &s;uppo&s;ed to have de&s;erted: and thus, after having made him pay heartily for all that he had &s;uffered under the bed, to leave him to the enjoyment of his panic, and the elegant &s;uit of clothes he had provided him. However, he was not &s;atisfied with this revenge, and determined on one &s;till more &s;olid. He went to the guard, and told the officers that he had met a capuchin friar, with all the en&s;igns of his &s;anctity about him, &s;culk|ing through the &s;treets in the dead of night, when they pretend to be employed in prayer for the &s;ins of mankind. That prompted by curio&s;ity to follow
<PB N="60" REF="032623_0059_0FF3E0D3899969A8">
him, the holy friar, as he expected, went &s;traight to the hou&s;e of a celebrated courtezan; that he &s;aw him admitted, and li&s;tened at the window till he heard them go to bed together; that if he did not find this information to be true, he would re&s;ign him&s;elf his pri&s;oner, and &s;ubmit to whatever puni&s;hment he &s;hould think proper.</P>
<P>The officer and his guard, delighted to have &s;uch hold of a capuchin (who pretend to be the very models of &s;anctity, and who revile in a particular manner the licentious life of the military) turned out with the utmo&s;t alacrity, and under the conduct of Pa&s;qual, &s;urrounded the lady's hou&s;e. Pa&s;qual began thundering at the door; and demanded en|trance for the officer and his guard. The unhappy &s;oldier waking with the noi&s;e, and not doubting that it was a detachment &s;ent to &s;eize him, gave him&s;elf up to de&s;pair, and in&s;tantly took &s;helter in the very place that Pa&s;qual had &s;o lately occupied; at the &s;ame time laying hold of all the things be found on the chair, never doubting that they were his own cloaths. As the lady was &s;omewhat dila|tory in opening the door, Pa&s;qual pretended to put his foot to it, when up it flew, and entering with the officer and his guard, demanded the body of a ca|puchin friar, who they were informed lodged with her that night. The lady had heard Pa&s;qual go out, and having no &s;u&s;picion that he would inform again&s;t him&s;elf, &s;he prote&s;ted her innocence in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, taking all the &s;aints to witne&s;s that &s;he knew no &s;uch per&s;on: But Pa&s;qual &s;u&s;pect|ing the retreat of the lover, began groping below the bed, and &s;oon pulled out his grea&s;y cowl and cloak: "Here, (&s;aid he to the officer) here are proofs enough: I'll an&s;wer for it Signor Padre him|&s;elf is at no great di&s;tance;" and putting his no&s;e below the bed; "Fogh (&s;aid he) I &s;mell him; he &s;tinks like a fox. The &s;ure&s;t method of finding a capuchin is by the no&s;e; you may wind him a mile
<PB N="61" REF="032623_0060_0FF3E0D68DDE79E0">
off." Then lowering their lanthorn, they beheld the unfortunate lover &s;queezed in betwixt the bed and the ground, and almo&s;t &s;tifled. "Here he is (&s;aid Pa&s;qual) with all the en&s;igns of his holine&s;s;" and pulling them out one by one, the crucifix, the ro&s;ary, and the cord of di&s;cipline; "You may &s;ee, (&s;aid he) "that the reverend father came here to do penance;" and taking up the cord, "&s;uppo&s;e now we &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t him in this meritorious work. Do you hear, Signor Padre? We will &s;ave you the trouble of inflicting it your&s;elf, and whether you come here to &s;in, or to repent, by your own maxims, you know a little &s;ound di&s;cipline is healthful to the &s;oul." The guard were lying round the bed, in convul&s;ions of laughter; and began breaking the mo&s;t in&s;olent jokes upon the &s;uppo&s;ed Padre. The life guard-man thought him&s;elf inchanted. He at la&s;t ventured to &s;peak, and declared they were all in a mi&s;take; that he was no capuchin: upon which the laugh redoubled, and the coar&s;e&s;t jokes were repeated. The lady, in the mean time, with the be&s;t di&s;&s;embled marks of fear and a&s;toni&s;hment, ran about the room, declaring that &s;ome &s;orcerer had been at work, and his incantations had taken their full effect. Pa&s;qual delighted to &s;ee that his plan had operated well, thought it now time to make his retreat, before the unfortunate lover could have an opportunity of examining his clothes, and perhaps detecting him: He therefore pretended regimental bu&s;ine&s;s, and regretting much that he was obliged to join his corps, took leave of the officers and his guard; at the &s;ame time recommending by all means, to treat the holy father with all that reverence and re&s;pect that was due to &s;o &s;acred a per&s;on.</P>
<P>The life guard man, when he got out from below the bed, began to look about for his clothes; but ob&s;erving nothing but the grea&s;y weeds of a capu|chin friar, he was now perfectly convinced, that Heaven had delivered him over, for his offences, to
<PB N="62" REF="032623_0061_0FF3E0D975FE3460">
the power of &s;ome daemon; (for of all mortals, the Neapolitan &s;oldiers are the mo&s;t &s;uper&s;titious) the lady, too acted her part &s;o well, that he had no longer any doubt of it. "Thus it is (&s;aid he in a penitential voice) to offend Heaven! I own my &s;in: I knew it was Friday, and yet, O fle&s;h! fle&s;h! Had it been any other day, I &s;till &s;hould have remained what I was. O, St. Januarius; I pa&s;&s;ed thee too, without paying thee due re&s;pect: thy all &s;eeing eye has found me out. Gentlemen, do with me what you plea&s;e; I am not what I &s;eem to be." No, no, (&s;aid the officer) we are all &s;en&s;ible of that: But come, Signor Padre, on with your garments, and march; we have no time to trifle. Here corporal (giving him the cordon) tie his hands, and let him feel the weight of St. Francis. The &s;aint owes him that, for having &s;o impudently denied him for his ma&s;ter." The poor &s;oldier was perfectly pa&s;&s;ive; they arrayed him in the &s;andals, the cowl and the cloak of Fra. Pa&s;qual, and put the great ro&s;ary about his neck; and a mo&s;t woeful figure he made. The officer made him look in the gla&s;s, to try if he could recollect him&s;elf, and a&s;ked him if he was a capu|chin now, or not. He was &s;hocked at his own ap|pearance; but bore every thing with meekne&s;s and re&s;ignation. They then conducted him to the guard, belabouring him all the way with the cord of St. Francis, and a&s;king him every &s;troke, if he knew his ma&s;ter now.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Pa&s;qual was &s;nug in his con|vent, enjoying the &s;weets of his adventure. He had a &s;pare cloak and a cowl, and was &s;oon equipped again like one of the holy fathers; he then took the clothes and accoutrements of the life-guard-man and laid them in a heap near the gate of another convent of capuchins, but at a great di&s;tance from his own, re&s;erving only to him&s;elf a trifle of money, which he found in the breeches pocket, ju&s;t to in|demnify him for the lo&s;s of his cloak and his cowl;
<PB N="63" REF="032623_0062_0FF3E0DB09B25878">
and even this, he &s;ays, he &s;hould have held &s;acred, but he knew whoever &s;hould find the clothes, would make a lawful prize of it.</P>
<P>The poor &s;oldier remained next day a &s;pectacle of ridicule to all the world; at la&s;t his companions <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ard of his &s;trange metamorpho&s;is, and came in troops to &s;ee him: their jokes were perhaps &s;till more galling than tho&s;e of the guard; but as he thought him&s;elf under the finger of God, or at lea&s;t of St. Januarius, he bore all with meekne&s;s and pa|tience: at la&s;t his clothes were found, and he was &s;et at liberty; but he believes to this day, that the whole was the work of the devil, &s;ent to cha&s;ti&s;e him for his &s;ins; and has never &s;ince &s;een his mi&s;|tre&s;s on a Friday, nor pa&s;&s;ed the &s;tatue of St. Janua|rius without muttering a prayer. Fra. Pa&s;qual has told the &s;tory to &s;everal of his mo&s;t intimate acquain|tance, whom he can depend on; among others, is the Abbe T. who has often had it from his own mouth.</P>

<P>IT is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay, that I am very well de&s;cend|ed; my ance&s;tors have made &s;ome noi&s;e in the world; for my mother cried oy&s;ters, and my father beat a drum: I am told we have even had &s;ome trumpeters in our family. Many a nobleman can|not &s;hew &s;o re&s;pectable a genealogy: but that is neither here nor there. As I was their only child, my father de&s;igned to breed me up to his own em|ployment, which was that of drummer to a puppet|&s;hew. Thus the whole employment of my younger years was tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of interpreter to punch and king Solomon in all his glory. But, though my father was very fond of in&s;tructing me in beating all the marches and points of war, I made no very great
<PB N="64" REF="032623_0063_0FF3E0DEBB9094B8">
progre&s;s, becau&s;e I naturally had no ear for mu&s;ic; &s;o, at the age of fifteen, I went and li&s;ted for a &s;ol|dier. As I had ever hated beating a drum, &s;o I &s;oon found that I di&s;liked carrying a mu&s;quet al&s;o; nei|ther the one trade nor the other were to my ta&s;te, for I was by nature fond of being a gentleman; be|&s;ides, I was obliged to obey my captain; he has his will, and I have mine: now I very rea&s;onably con|cluded, that it was much more comfortable for a man to obey his own will than another's.</P>
<P>The &s;pleen was the con&s;equence of leading a &s;ol|dier's life; I a&s;ked leave to quit the &s;ervice; but, as I was tall and &s;trong, my Captain thanked me for my kind intention, and &s;aid, becau&s;e he had a regard for me, we &s;hould not part. I wrote to my father a very di&s;mal penitent letter, and de&s;ired that he would rai&s;e money to pay for my di&s;charge; but the good man was as fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d of drinking as I was, and tho&s;e who are fond of drinking never pay for other people's di&s;charges: in &s;hort, he never an&s;wered my letter. What could be done? If I have not money, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, to pay for my di&s;charge, I mu&s;t find an equivalent &s;ome other way; and that mu&s;t be by running away. I de&s;erted, and that an&s;wered my purpo&s;e every bit as well as if I had bought my di&s;|charge.</P>
<P>As I had by this means got rid of my military oc|cupation, I &s;old my &s;oldier's cloaths, bought wor&s;e, and, in order not to be overtaken, took the mo&s;t unfrequented roads po&s;&s;ible. One evening, as I was entering a village, I perceived a man, whom I after|wards found to be the curate of the pari&s;h, thrown from his hor&s;e in a miry road, and almo&s;t &s;mothered in the mud. He de&s;ired my a&s;&s;i&s;tance; I gave it, and drew him out with &s;ome difficulty. He thank|ed me for my trouble, and was going off; but I followed him home, for I loved always to have a man thank me at his own door. The curate a&s;ked an hundred que&s;tions; as who&s;e &s;on I was; from
<PB N="65" REF="032623_0064_0FF3E0E2690B4B30">
whence I came; and whether I would be faithful. I an&s;wered him greatly to his &s;atisfaction; and gave my&s;elf one of the be&s;t characters in the world for &s;obriety, di&s;cretion and fidelity. To make a long &s;tory &s;hort, he wanted a &s;ervant, and hired me. With him I lived but two months; we did not much like each other; I was fond of eating, and he gave me but little to eat: I loved a pretty girl, and the old woman, my fellow-&s;ervant, was ill-natured and ugly. As they endeavoured to &s;tarve me between them, I made a pious re&s;olution to prevent their committing murder: I &s;tole the eggs as &s;oon as they were laid; I emptied every unfini&s;hed bottle that I could lay my hands on; whatever eatable came in my way was &s;ure to di&s;appear: in &s;hort, they found I would not do; &s;o I was di&s;charged one morning, and paid three &s;hillings and &s;ix pence for two months wages.</P>
<P>I employed my&s;elf in making preparations for my departure, while my money was getting ready; two hens were hatching in an out-hou&s;e, I went and took the eggs from habit, and, not to &s;eparate the parents from the children, I lodged hens and all in my knap&s;ack. After this piece of frugality, I re|turned to receive my money, and with my knap&s;ack on my back, and a &s;taff in my hand, I bid adieu, with tears in my eyes, to my old benefactor. I had not gone far from the hou&s;e, when I heard behind me the cry of '&s;top thief'! but this only increa&s;ed my di&s;patch; it would have been fooli&s;h to &s;top, as I knew the voice could not be levelled at me. I think I pa&s;&s;ed tho&s;e months at the curate's without drinking; and I never &s;pent two more pious, &s;tupid months in all my life.</P>
<P>I happened to meet with a company of &s;trolling players, after travelling &s;ome days. The moment I &s;aw them at a di&s;tance, my heart warmed to them; I had a &s;ort of natural love for every thing of the vagabond order: they were employed in &s;ettling
<PB N="66" REF="032623_0065_0FF3E0E45769AED0">
their baggage, which had been overturned in a nar|row way; I offered my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which they ac|cepted; and we &s;oon became &s;o well acquainted, that they took me as a &s;ervant. This was a paradi&s;e to me; they &s;ung, danced, drank, eat, and travel|led, all at the &s;ame time. By the blood of the Mira|bels, I thought I had never lived till then; I grew as merry as a grig, and laughed at every word that was &s;poken. They liked me as much as I liked them; I was a very good figure; and, though I was poor, I was not mode&s;t.</P>
<P>Above all things in the world, I love a &s;traggling life; &s;ometimes good, &s;ometimes bad; to be warm to-day, and cold to-morrow; to eat when one can get it, and drink when it &s;tands before me. We arrived that evening at Tenterden, and took a large room at the Greyhound; where we re&s;olved to ex|hibit Romeo and Juliet, with the funeral proce&s;&s;ion, the grave, and the garden &s;cene. Romeo was to be performed by a gentleman from the Theatre-Royal in D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ury-Lane; Juliet by a lady who had never ap|peared on any &s;tage before; and I to &s;nuff the can|dles: all excellent in our way. We had figures enough, but the difficulty was to dre&s;s them. The &s;ame coat that &s;erved Romeo, turned with the blue lining outwards, &s;erved for his friend Mercutio; a large piece of crape &s;ufficed at once for Juliet's pet|ticoat and pall: a pe&s;tle and mortar from a neigh|bouring apothecary's an&s;wered all the purpo&s;es of a bell; and our landlord's own family, wrapped in white &s;heets, &s;erved to fill up the proce&s;&s;ion. In &s;hort, there were but three figures among us that might be &s;aid to be dre&s;&s;ed with any propriety: I mean the nur&s;e, the &s;tarved apothecary, and my&s;elf. Our performance give univer&s;al &s;atisfaction: the whole audience were inchanted with our powers.</P>
<P>A &s;trolling player may be ever &s;ure of &s;ucce&s;s, if he follows one rule; that is, in our theatrical way of expre&s;&s;ing it, to make a great deal of the character.
<PB N="67" REF="032623_0066_0FF3E0E5EEAFEB68">
To &s;peak and act as in common life, is not playing, nor is it what people come to &s;ee: natural &s;peaking, like &s;weet wine, runs glibly over the palate, and &s;carce leaves any ta&s;te behind it; but being high in a part, re&s;embles vinegar, which grates upon the ta&s;te, and one feels it while he is drinking. To plea&s;e in town or country, the way is, to cry, wring, cringe into attitudes, mark the empha&s;is, &s;lap the pockets, and labour like one in the falling &s;ickne&s;s: that is the way to work for applau&s;e; that is the way to gain it.</P>
<P>Our &s;kill in this fir&s;t exhibition e&s;tabli&s;hed our reputation, and it was but natural for me to a&s;cribe part of the &s;ucce&s;s to my&s;elf; I &s;nuffed the candles, and, let me tell you, that, without a candle-&s;nuffer, the piece would lo&s;e half its embelli&s;hments&punc; In this manner we continued a fortnight, and drew tol|erable hou&s;es; but the evening before our intended departure, we gave out our very be&s;t piece, in which all our &s;trength was to be exerted. We had great expectations from this, and even doubled our prices, when behold one of the principal actors fell ill of a violent fever. This was a &s;troke like thunder to our little company: they were re&s;olved to go in a body, to &s;cold the man for falling &s;ick at &s;o inconvenient a time, and that too of a di&s;order that threatened to be expen&s;ive; I &s;eized the moment, and offered to act the part my&s;elf in his &s;tead. The ca&s;e was de&s;|perate; they accepted my offer; and I accordingly &s;at down, with the part in my hand, and a tankard before me, and &s;tudied the character, which was to be rehear&s;ed the next day, and played &s;oon after.</P>
<P>Drinking, I found, helped my memory exceed|ingly. I learned my part with a&s;toni&s;hing rapidity, and bid adieu to &s;nuffing candles ever after. I found that nature had de&s;igned me for more noble employ|ments, and I was re&s;olved to take her when in the humour. We got together in order to rehear&s;e, and I informed my companions, ma&s;ters now no
<PB N="68" REF="032623_0067_0FF3E0E7F4E26BF0">
longer, of the &s;urpri&s;ing change I felt within me. Let the &s;ick man, &s;aid I, be under no unea&s;ine&s;s to get well again; I will fill his place to univer&s;al &s;at|isfaction; he may even die if he thinks proper; I will engage that he &s;hall never be mi&s;&s;ed. I rehear|&s;ed before them, &s;trutted, ranted, and received ap|plau&s;e. They &s;oon gave out that a new actor of eminence was to appear, and immediately all the genteel places were be&s;poke. Before I a&s;cended the &s;tage, however, I concluded within my&s;elf, that, as I brought money to the hou&s;e, I ought to have my &s;hare in the profits. Gentlemen, (&s;aid I, addre&s;&s;ing our company) I do not pretend to direct you; far be if from me to treat you with &s;o much ingratitude: you have publi&s;hed my name in the bills, with the utmo&s;t good nature; and, as affairs &s;tand, cannot act without me; &s;o, gentlemen, to &s;hew you my gratitude, I expect to be paid for my acting as much as any of you, otherwi&s;e I declare off. I will bran|di&s;h my &s;nuffers, and clip candles as u&s;ual. This was a very di&s;agreeable propo&s;al, but they found it was impo&s;&s;ible to refu&s;e it; it was irre&s;i&s;tible, it was adamant: they con&s;ented, and I went on in king Bajazet: my frowning brows, bound with a &s;tocking &s;tuffed into a turban, while on my captived arms I brandi&s;hed a jack-chain.</P>
<P>I was tall, and had a loud voice; nature indeed had fitted me for the part: my very entrance excited univer&s;al applau&s;e; I looked round on the audience with a &s;mile, and made a mo&s;t low and graceful bow, for that is the rule among us. As it was a very pa&s;&s;ionate part, I invigorated my &s;pirits with three full gla&s;&s;es of brandy. By Alla! it is almo&s;t incon|ceivable how I went through it: Tamerlane was but a fool to me; though he was &s;ometimes loud enough too, yet I was &s;till louder than he: but then, be&s;ides, I had attitudes in abundance: in general I kept my arms folded upon the pit of my &s;tomach; it is the way at Drury-Lane, and has always had a fine effect.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="032623_0068_0FF3E0EC4D92E638">In &s;hort, I came off like a prodigy; and, &s;uch was my &s;ucce&s;s, that I could ravi&s;h the laurels even from a &s;irloin of beef. The principal gentlemen and ladies of the town came to me, after the play was over, to compliment me upon my &s;ucce&s;s; one prai&s;ed my voice, another my per&s;on; upon my word, &s;ays the '&s;quire's lady, he will make one of the fine&s;t actors in Europe; I &s;ay it, and I think I am &s;ome|thing of a judge.&mdash;Prai&s;e in the beginning is agree|able enough, and we receive it as a favour; but when it comes in great quantities we regard it only as a debt, which nothing but our merit could extort: in&s;tead of thanking them, I internally applauded my&s;elf. We were de&s;ired to give our piece a &s;econd time; we obeyed, and I was applauded even more than before.</P>
<P>In order to be at a hor&s;e-race at &s;ome di&s;tance from thence, we left the town. I &s;hall never think of Tenterden without tears of gratitude and re&s;pect. The ladies and gentlemen there, take my word for it, are very good judges of plays and actors. We quitted the town, I &s;ay; and there was a wide diff|erence between my coming in and going out; I en|tered the town a candle-&s;nuffer, and I quitted it an hero!&mdash;Such is the world; little to-day, and great to-morrow. I could &s;ay a great deal more upon that &s;ubject, &s;omething truly &s;ublime, upon the ups and downs of fortune; but it would give you the &s;pleen, and &s;o I &s;hall pa&s;s it over.</P>
<P>Before we arrived at the next town, the races were ended, which was no &s;mall di&s;appointment to our company; however, we were re&s;olved to take all we could get. I played capital characters there too, and came off with my u&s;ual brilliancy. I &s;incerely believe I &s;hould have been the fir&s;t actor in Europe, had my growing merit been properly cultivated; but there came an unkindly fro&s;t which nipped me in the bud, and levelled me once more down to the common &s;tandard of humanity. I played Sir Harry
<PB N="70" REF="032623_0069_0FF3E0EE638308B0">
Wildair; all the country ladies were charmed if I but drew out my &s;nuff-box, the whole hou&s;e was in a roar of rapture; when I exerci&s;ed my cudgel, I thought they would have fallen into convul&s;ions.</P>
<P>As bad luck would have it, there was here a lady who had received an education of nine months in London; and this gave her preten&s;ions to ta&s;te, which rendered her the indi&s;putable mi&s;tre&s;s of the cere|monies wherever &s;he came. She was informed of my merits; every body prai&s;ed me; yet &s;he refu&s;ed at fir&s;t going to &s;ee me perform; &s;he could not con|ceive, &s;he &s;aid, any thing but &s;tuff from a &s;troller; talked &s;omething in prai&s;e of Garrick, and amazed the ladies with her &s;kill in enunciations, tones, and cadences: &s;he was at la&s;t, however, prevailed upon to go; and it was privately intimated to me what a judge was to be pre&s;ent at my next exhibition: how|ever, no way intimidated, I came on in Sir Harry, one hand &s;tuck in my breeches, and the other in my bo&s;om, as u&s;ual at Drury-Lane; but, in&s;tead of look|ing at me, I perceived the whole audience had their eyes turned upon the lady who had been nine months in London; from her they expected the deci&s;ion which was to &s;ecure the General's truncheon in my hand, or &s;ink me down into a theatrical letter-car|rier. I opened my &s;nuff-box, took &s;nuff; the lady was &s;olemn, and &s;o were the re&s;t; I broke my cudgel on Alderman Smuggler's back; &s;till gloomy, melan|choly all, the lady groaned and &s;hrugged her &s;houl|ders; I attempted, by laughing my&s;elf to excite at lea&s;t a &s;mile; but not a cheek could I perceive wrinkled into &s;ympathy: I found it would not do; all my good humour now became forced; my laugh|ter was converted into hy&s;teric grinning; and, while I pretended &s;pirits, my eye &s;hewed the agony of my heart: in &s;hort, the lady came with an intention to be di&s;plea&s;ed, and di&s;plea&s;ed &s;he was; my fame expired for ever!</P>

<HEAD>Proof of the Nece&s;&s;ity of an early Choice of our Profe&s;&s;ion, and Per&s;everance in it, exemplified in the remarkable Conduct of Polyphilus.</HEAD>
<P>IT is never without very melancholy reflections, that we can ob&s;erve the mi&s;conduct or mi&s;carriage of tho&s;e men, who &s;eem by the force of under&s;tand|ing, or extent of knowledge, exempted from the general frailties of human nature, and privileged from the common infelicities of life. Though the world is crouded with &s;cenes of calamity, we look for the mo&s;t part upon the general ma&s;s of wretchedne&s;s with very little regard, and fix our eyes upon the &s;tate of particular per&s;ons, whom the eminence of their qualities mark out from the multitude. As in reading the account of a battle, we &s;eldom reflect on the vulgar heaps of &s;laughter, but follow the hero with our whole attention, through all the varieties of his fortune, without a thought of the thou&s;ands which are falling round him.</P>
<P>With the &s;ame kind of anxious veneration, I have for many years pa&s;t, been making ob&s;ervations on the life of Polyphilus, a man whom all his acquaint|ances have, from his fir&s;t appearance in the world, feared for the quickne&s;s of his di&s;cernment, and admired for the multiplicity of his attainments; but who&s;e progre&s;s in life, and who&s;e u&s;efulne&s;s to man|kind have perhaps been hindered by the &s;uperfluity of his knowledge, and the celerity of his mind.</P>
<P>Polyphilus was remarkable at &s;chool for &s;urpa&s;&s;ing all his companions, without any vi&s;ible application: and, at the univer&s;ity, was di&s;tingui&s;hed equally for his &s;ucce&s;sful progre&s;s, as well through the rough and thorny mazes of &s;cience, as the &s;mooth and flowing parts of politer literature; without any &s;trict confinement to hours of &s;tudy, or any remarkable forbearance of the common amu&s;ements of young men.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="032623_0071_0FF3E0F1F2B137F8">When Polyphilus was at the age in which men u&s;ually chu&s;e their profe&s;&s;ion, and prepare to enter into a public character, every academical eye was fixed upon him; and all were curious to enquire what this univer&s;al genius would fix upon for the employment of life; and, no doubt was made but, that he would leave all his cotemporaries behind him, and mount to the highe&s;t honors of that cla&s;s in which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;hould inli&s;t him&s;elf, without tho&s;e delays and pau&s;es which mu&s;t always be endured by meaner abilities.</P>
<P>Polyphilus, though by no means in&s;olent, or a&s;|&s;uming, had been &s;ufficiently encouraged by unin|terrupted &s;ucce&s;s, to place great confidence in his own parts; and was not below his companions in the indulgence of his hopes and expectation of the a&s;toni&s;hment with which the world would be &s;truck, when fir&s;t his lu&s;tre would break out upon it; nor could he help to join &s;ometimes in the mirth of his friends, at the &s;udden di&s;appearance of tho&s;e, who having &s;hone a while, and drawn the eyes of the public upon their feeble lu&s;tre, were now doomed to fade away before him.</P>
<P>It is natural for a man to catch advantageous no|tions of the condition, which tho&s;e with whom he conver&s;es are &s;triving to attain. Polyphilus, in a ramble to London, fell accidentally among the phy|&s;icians, and was &s;o much plea&s;ed with the pro&s;pect of turning philo&s;ophy to profit, and &s;o highly delighted with a new theory of fevers, which darted into his imagination, and which, after having con&s;idered, in a few hours, he found him&s;elf able to maintain again&s;t all the advocates for the ancient &s;y&s;tem, that he re&s;olved to apply him&s;elf to anatomy, botany, and chemi&s;try; and to leave no part unconquered, either of the animal, mineral, or vegetable kingdoms.</P>
<P>He, therefore, read authors, contra&s;ted &s;y&s;tems, and tried experiments. But unhappily, as he was going to &s;ee a new plant in flower at Chel&s;ea, he met,
<PB N="73" REF="032623_0072_0FF3E0F5D6E73860">
(in cro&s;&s;ing We&s;tmin&s;ter, to take the water) the Chancellor's coach. He had the curio&s;ity to follow him into the hall, where a remarkable cau&s;e hap|pened to be tried; and found him&s;elf able to produce &s;o many arguments, which the lawyers had omitted on both &s;ides, that he determined to quit phy&s;ic for a profe&s;&s;ion in which he found it would be &s;o ea&s;y to excel, and which promi&s;ed high honours, and large profits, without melancholy attendance upon mi&s;ery, mean &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to peevi&s;hne&s;s, and contin|ual interruption of re&s;t and plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>He immediately took chambers in the Temple, bought a common place book, and confined him&s;elf for &s;ome months to the peru&s;al of the &s;tatutes, year books, pleadings, and reports. He was a con&s;tant hearer of the proceedings in the courts, and began to put ca&s;es with rea&s;onable accuracy. But he &s;oon di&s;covered, by con&s;idering the patience of lawyers, that preferment was not to be got by acutene&s;s, learning, and eloquence. He was perplexed by the ab&s;urdities of attornies, and mi&s;repre&s;entations made by his clients of their own cau&s;es; by the u&s;ele&s;s anxiety of the one, and the ince&s;&s;ant impor|tunity of another. He began to repent of having devoted him&s;elf to a &s;tudy, which was &s;o narrow in its comprehen&s;ion, which could never carry his name to any other country, and thought it unworthy of a man of parts, to &s;ell his life only for money. The barrenne&s;s of his fellow &s;tudents, forced him general|ly into other company at his hours of entertainment; and among the varieties of conver&s;ation through which his curio&s;ity was daily wandering, he, by chance, mingled at a tavern with &s;ome intelligent officers of the army. A man of letters was ea&s;ily dazzled with the gaiety of their appearance, and &s;oftened into kindne&s;s by the politene&s;s of their ad|dre&s;s. He therefore cultivated this new acquaint|ance; and when he &s;aw how readily they found, in every place, admi&s;&s;ion and regard, and how famil|iarly
<PB N="74" REF="032623_0073_0FF3E0F791972898">
they mingled with every rank and order of men, he began to feel his heart beat for military honours, and wondered how the prejudices of the Univer&s;ity &s;hould have made him &s;o long in&s;en&s;ible of that ambition, which had fired &s;o many hearts in every age; and negligent of that calling, which is above all others, univer&s;ally and invariably illu&s;tri|ous, and which gives even to the exterior appearance of its profe&s;&s;ors, a dignity and freedom unknown to the re&s;t of mankind.</P>
<P>The&s;e favourable impre&s;&s;ions were made &s;till deeper by his conver&s;ation with the ladies, who&s;e regard for &s;oldiers he could not ob&s;erve without wi&s;hing him&s;elf of that fraternity, to which the fe|male world &s;eemed to devote all their charms and kindne&s;s. The love of knowledge, which was &s;till his predominant inclination, was gratified by the recital of adventures, and accounts of foreign coun|tries; and, therefore, he thought there was no way of life in which all his views could &s;o completely concentre as in that of a &s;oldier. In the art of war he thought it not difficult to excel, having ob&s;erved his new friends not very much ver&s;ed in the princi|ples of tactics, or fortification; and, therefore, he &s;tudied all the military writers, both ancient and modern; and, in a &s;hort time, could tell how to have gained every remarkable battle that had been lo&s;t from the beginning of the world. He often &s;hewed at a table how Alexander &s;hould have been checked in his conque&s;t, what was the fatal error at Phar&s;alia, how Charles of Sweden might have e&s;ca|ped his ruin at Pultowa, and Marlborough might have been made to repent his temerity at Blenheim. He entrenched armies upon paper, &s;o that no &s;upe|riority of numbers could force them; and modelled in clay many impregnable fortre&s;&s;es, on which the pre&s;ent arts of attack would be exhau&s;ted without effect.</P>
<P>Polyphilus in a &s;hort time obtained a commi&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="75" REF="032623_0074_0FF3E0F9D7F462A0">
but before he could rub off the &s;olemnity of a &s;cho|lar, and gain the true air of military vivacity, a war was declared, and forces &s;ent to the continent. Here Polyphilus unhappily found, that &s;tudy alone would not make a &s;oldier; for being much accu&s;|tomed to think, the &s;en&s;e of danger &s;unk into his mind, and he felt at the approach of any action, that terror which a &s;entence of death would have brought upon him. He &s;aw that in&s;tead of conquering their fears, the endeavours of his gay friends were only to e&s;cape them; but his philo&s;ophy chained his mind to its object, and rather loaded him with &s;hackles than furni&s;hed him with arms. He, how|ever, &s;uppre&s;&s;ed his mi&s;ery in &s;ilence, and pa&s;&s;ed through the campaign with honour, but found him|&s;elf utterly unable to &s;upport another.</P>
<P>He then had recour&s;e again to his books, and continued to range from one &s;tudy to another. As I u&s;ually vi&s;it him once a month, and am admitted to him without previous notice; I have found him within this la&s;t half year decyphering the Chine&s;e language, making a farce, collecting a vocabulary of the ob&s;olete terms of the Engli&s;h law, writing an inquiry concerning the ancient Corinthian bra&s;s, and forming a new &s;cheme of the variations of the needle.</P>
<P>Thus his powerful genius, which might have extended the &s;phere of any &s;cience, or benefited the world in any profe&s;&s;ion, is di&s;&s;ipated in a boundle&s;s variety, without any profit to others or to him&s;elf. He makes &s;udden irruptions into the regions of knowledge, and &s;ees all ob&s;tacles give way before him; but he never &s;tays long enough to complete his conque&s;t, to e&s;tabli&s;h laws, or bring away the &s;poils.</P>

<HEAD>The Way of the World.</HEAD>
<P>FULVIUS was a very good natured fellow, but is now no more. He was bred in a compting-hou&s;e, and his father dying ju&s;t as he was out of his time, left him an hand&s;ome fortune, and many friends to advi&s;e with. The re&s;traint in which he had been brought up, had thrown a gloom upon his temper, which &s;ome regarded as prudence; and, from &s;uch con&s;iderations he had every day repeated offers of friend&s;hip. Such as had money, were ready to offer him their a&s;&s;i&s;tance that way; and tho&s;e who had daughters, frequently, in the warmth of affection, advi&s;ed him to marry. Fulvius was in good circum&s;tances; he wanted neither money, friends, nor a wi&s;e; and therefore mode&s;tly declined their propo&s;als.</P>
<P>He was brought to a different way of thinking by &s;ome errors in the management of his affairs, and &s;everal lo&s;&s;es in trade; and he at la&s;t con&s;idered, that it was his be&s;t way to let his friends know that their offers were at length acceptable. His fir&s;t addre&s;s was to a &s;crivener, who had formerly made him fre|quent offers of money and friend&s;hip, at a time when, perhaps, he knew tho&s;e offers would have been refu&s;ed. As a man, therefore, confident of not being refu&s;ed, he reque&s;ted the u&s;e of an hun|dred guineas for a few days, as he ju&s;t then had occa&s;ion for money. "And pray, Sir," replied the &s;crivener, "do you want all this money?" "Want it, Sir," &s;ays the other, "if I did not want it I &s;hould not have a&s;ked it." "I am &s;orry for that," &s;ays the friend, "for tho&s;e who want money when they borrow, will always want money when they come to pay. To &s;ay the truth, Sir, money is money now; and I believe it is all &s;unk in the bottom of the &s;ea, for my part; he that has got a little is a fool if he does not keep what he has got."</P>
<P>Fulvius was not quite di&s;concerted by this refu|&s;al,
<PB N="77" REF="032623_0076_0FF3E0FF07EFC4D0">
and was re&s;olved to apply to another, whom he knew was the very be&s;t friend he had in the world. The gentleman whom he now addre&s;&s;ed, received his propo&s;al with all the affability that could be ex|pected from generous friend&s;hip. "Let me &s;ee, you want an hundred guineas; and pray, my dear friend, would not fifty an&s;wer?" "If you have but fifty to &s;pare, Sir, I mu&s;t be contented." "Fifty to &s;pare; I do not &s;ay that, for I believe I have but twenty about me." "Then I mu&s;t borrow the other thirty from &s;ome other friend." "And pray," replied the friend, "would it not be the be&s;t way to borrow the whole money from that other friend, and then one note will &s;erve for all, you know? You know, my dear Sir, that you need make no ceremony with me at any time; you know I am your friend; and when you chu&s;e a bit of dinner, or &s;o&mdash;You, Tom, &s;ee the gentleman down. You won't forget to dine with us now and then. Your very humble &s;ervant."</P>
<P>This treatment di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, but did not di&s;courage him, and he was at la&s;t re&s;olved to find that a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance from love, which he could not have from friend&s;hip. A young lady, a di&s;tant relation by the mother's &s;ide, had a fortune in her own hands; and, as &s;he had already made all the advances that the mode&s;ty of her &s;ex would permit, he made his propo&s;al with confidence. He &s;oon, however, per|ceived, that no bankrupt ever found the fair one kind. She had lately fallen deeply in love with ano|ther, who had more money, and the whole neigh|bourhood thought it would be a match.</P>
<P>Every &s;ucceeding day now began to &s;trip him of his former finery; his cloaths flew piece by piece, to the pawnbroker's, and he &s;eemed at length equip|ped in the genuine livery of misfortune. But &s;till he thought him&s;elf &s;ecure from actual nece&s;&s;ity; the numberle&s;s invitations he had received to dine, even after his lo&s;&s;es, were yet unan&s;wered; he was
<PB N="78" REF="032623_0077_0FF3E101AF60AD68">
therefore now re&s;olved to accept of a dinner becau&s;e he wanted one; and in this manner he actually lived among his friends a whole week without being openly affronted. The la&s;t place he went to, he had, as he fancied, ju&s;t nicked the time of dinner, for he came in as the cloth was laying. He took a chair without being de&s;ired, and talked for &s;ome time without being attended to. He a&s;&s;ured the company that nothing procured &s;o good an appetite as a walk in the Park, where he had been that morning. He went on, and prai&s;ed the figure of the dama&s;k table-cloth; talked of a fea&s;t where he had been the day before, but that the veni&s;on was overdone. But all this procured him no invitation: finding therefore the gentleman of the hou&s;e in&s;en|&s;ible to all his fetches, he thought proper, at la&s;t, to retire, and mend his appetite by a &s;econd walk in the Park.</P>
<P>O ye &s;ons of misfortune whoever you be, whether in rags or lace; whether in Kent-&s;treet or the Mall; whether at the Smyrna or St. Giles's, be advi&s;ed by a friend, never &s;eem to want the favour which you &s;olicit. Apply to every pa&s;&s;ion but human pity for redre&s;s: you may find permanent relief from vanity, from &s;elf-intere&s;t, or from avarice, but from com|pa&s;&s;ion never. The very eloquence of a poor man is di&s;gu&s;ting, and that mouth which is opened even by wi&s;dom, is &s;eldom expected to clo&s;e without the horrors of a petition.</P>
<P>If you wi&s;h to ward off the gripe of poverty, you mu&s;t pretend to be a &s;tranger to her, and &s;he will at lea&s;t u&s;e you with ceremony. If you be caught dining upon a halfpenny porringer of pea&s;e-&s;oup and potatoes, prai&s;e the whole&s;omene&s;s of your fru|gal repa&s;t. You may ob&s;erve, that Dr. Cheyne has pre&s;cribed pea&s;e-broth for the gravel; hint that you are not one of tho&s;e who are always making a deity of their belly. If, again, you are obliged to wear a &s;lim&s;y &s;tuff in the mid&s;t of winter, be the fir&s;t to
<PB N="79" REF="032623_0078_0FF3E10346FD8D00">
remark, that &s;tuffs are very much worn at Paris; or, if there be found &s;ome irreparable defects in any part of your equipage, which cannot be concealed by all the arts of &s;itting cro&s;s-legged, coaxing, or derning, &s;ay, that neither you nor Samp&s;on Gideon were ever very fond of dre&s;s. If you be a philo&s;o|pher, hint that Plato or Seneca are the taylors you choo&s;e to employ; a&s;&s;ure the company that man ought to be content with a bare covering, &s;ince what now is &s;o much his pride, was formerly his &s;hame. In &s;hort, however caught, never give out; but a&s;|cribe to the frugality of your di&s;po&s;ition what others might be apt to attribute to the narrowne&s;s of your circum&s;tances. To be poor, and to &s;eem poor, is a certain method never to ri&s;e: pride in the great is hateful: in the wi&s;e it is ridiculous; but beggar|ly pride is a rational vanity, which I have been taught to applaud and excu&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>On Plea&s;ure.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been the object of writers of every age to &s;hew that plea&s;ure is in us, and not in the objects offered for our amu&s;ement. If the &s;oul be happily di&s;po&s;ed, every thing becomes capable of affording entertainment, and di&s;tre&s;s will almo&s;t want a name. Every occurrence pa&s;&s;es in review like the figures of a proce&s;&s;ion; &s;ome may be aukward, others ill-dre&s;&s;ed; but none but a fool is for this enraged with the ma&s;ter of the ceremonies.</P>
<P>An in&s;tance of the truth of this was &s;een in the per&s;on of a &s;lave in a fortification in Flanders, who appeared no way touched with his &s;ituation. He was maimed, deformed, and chained; obliged to toil from the appearance of day till night, and con|demned to this for life; yet, with all the&s;e circum|&s;tances of apparent wretchedne&s;s, he &s;ung, would
<PB N="80" REF="032623_0079_0FF3E1068DC5D548">
have danced, but he wanted a leg, and appeared the merrie&s;t, happie&s;t man of all the garri&s;on. What a practical philo&s;opher was here! an happy con&s;titu|tion &s;upplied philo&s;ophy; and, though &s;eemingly de&s;titute of wi&s;dom, he was really wi&s;e. No reading or &s;tudy had contributed to di&s;enchant the fairy-land around him. Every thing furni&s;hed him with an opportunity of mirth; and, though &s;ome thought him, from his in&s;en&s;ibility, a fool, he was &s;uch an ideot as philo&s;ophers &s;hould wi&s;h to imitate; for all philo&s;ophy is only forcing the trade of happine&s;s, when nature &s;eems to deny the means.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who, like our &s;lave, can place them&s;elves on that &s;ide of the world in which every thing ap|pears in a plea&s;ing light, will find &s;omething in every occurrence to excite their good humour. The mo&s;t calamitous events, either to them&s;elves or others, can bring no new affliction; the whole world is to them a theatre, on which comedies only are acted. All the bu&s;tle of heroi&s;m, or the rants of ambition, &s;erve only to heighten the ab&s;urdity of the &s;cene, and make the humour more poignant. They feel, in &s;hort, as little angui&s;h at their own di&s;tre&s;s, or the complaints of others, as the under|taker, though dre&s;&s;ed in black, feels &s;orrow at a funeral.</P>
<P>The famous Cardinal de Retz po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed this hap|pine&s;s of temper in the highe&s;t degree, more per|haps than any other man in the world. As he was a man of gallantry, and de&s;pi&s;ed all that wore the pedantic appearance of philo&s;ophy, wherever plea|&s;ure was to be &s;old, he was generally foremo&s;t to rai&s;e the auction. Being an univer&s;al admirer of the fair &s;ex, when he found one lady cruel, he gen|erally fell in love with another, from whom he ex|pected a more favourable reception: if &s;he too re|jected his addre&s;&s;es, he never thought of retiring into de&s;arts, or pining in hopele&s;s di&s;tre&s;s. He per&s;ua|ded him&s;elf, that, in&s;tead of loving the lady, he on|ly
<PB N="81" REF="032623_0080_0FF3E109C2B3E500">
fancied that he had loved her, and &s;o all was well again. When fortune wore her angrie&s;t look, and he at la&s;t fell into the power of his mo&s;t deadly ene|my Cardinal Mazarine, (being confined a clo&s;e pri&s;|oner in the ca&s;tle of Valenciennes) he never attempt|ed to &s;upport his di&s;tre&s;s by wi&s;dom or philo&s;ophy, for he pretended to neither. He only laughed at him&s;elf and his per&s;ecutor, and &s;eemed infinitely plea&s;ed at his new &s;ituation. In this man&s;ion of di&s;|tre&s;s, though &s;ecluded from his friends, though de|nied all the amu&s;ements, and even the conveniences of life, he &s;till retained his good humour; laughed at all the little &s;pite of his enemies; and carried the je&s;t &s;o far as to be revenged, by writing the life of his gaoler.</P>
<P>To be &s;tubborn or &s;ullen under misfortunes, is all that the wi&s;dom of the proud can teach. The Cardinal's example will in&s;truct us to be merry in circum&s;tances of the highe&s;t affliction. It matters not whether our good humour be con&s;trued by others into in&s;en&s;ibility, or even ideoti&s;m; it is hap|pine&s;s to our&s;elves, and none but a fool would mea|&s;ure his &s;atisfaction by what the world thinks of it: for my own part, I never pa&s;s by one of our pri&s;ons for debt, when I do not envy that felicity which is &s;till going forward among tho&s;e people who forget the care of the world by being &s;hut out from its ambition.</P>
<P>The following account of a good natured fellow, who actually &s;ub&s;i&s;ts at this moment, is a ca&s;e in point. Whenever he fell into any mi&s;ery, he u&s;ually called it &s;eeing life. If his head was broke by a chairman, or his pocket picked by a &s;harper, he comforted him&s;elf by imitating the Hibernian dia|lect of the one, or the more fa&s;hionable cant of the other. Nothing came ami&s;s to him. His inatten|tion to money matters had incen&s;ed his father to &s;uch a degree, that all the interce&s;&s;ion of friends in his fav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r was fruitle&s;s. The old gentleman was
<PB N="82" REF="032623_0081_0FF3E10C436A4868">
on his death-bed. The whole family, and Dick among the number, gathered around him. "I leave my &s;econd &s;on Andrew," &s;aid the expiring mi&s;er, "my whole e&s;tate, and de&s;ire him to be frugal" Andrew, in a &s;orrowful tone, as is u&s;ual on the&s;e occa&s;ions, prayed Heaven to prolong his life and health to enjoy it him&s;elf. "I recommend Simon, my third &s;on, to the care of his elder brother, and leave him be&s;ide four thou&s;and pounds." "Ah! father," cried Simon (in great affliction to be &s;ure) "May Heaven give you life and health to enjoy it your&s;elf." At la&s;t, turning to poor Dick, "As for you, you have always been a &s;ad dog; you will nev|er come to good; you will never be rich; I will leave you a &s;hilling to buy an halter." "Ah! father," cries Dick, without any emotion, "may Heaven give you life and health to enjoy it your&s;elf." This was all the trouble the lo&s;s of fortune gave this thoughtle&s;s imprudent creature. However, the tenderne&s;s of an uncle recompen&s;ed the neglect of a father; and he is now not only exce&s;&s;ively good-humoured, but competently rich.</P>
<P>Let the world cry out at a bankrupt who appears at a ball; at an author who laughs at the public which pronounces him a dunce; at a General who &s;miles at the reproach of the vulgar, or the lady who keeps her good humour in &s;pite of &s;candal; but &s;uch is the wi&s;e&s;t behaviour that any of us can po&s;&s;ibly a&s;&s;ume; it is certainly a better way to op|po&s;e calamity by di&s;&s;ipation, than to take up the arms of rea&s;on or re&s;olution to oppo&s;e it: by the fir&s;t method, we forget our mi&s;eries; by the la&s;t, we only conceal them from others; by &s;truggling with misfortunes, we are &s;ure to receive &s;ome wounds in the conflict; but a &s;ure method to come off vic|torious, is by running away.</P>

<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PART I.</HEAD>
<P>THEY were the &s;weete&s;t notes I ever heard; and I in&s;tantly let down the fore-gla&s;s, to hear them more di&s;tinctly.&mdash;It is Maria, &s;aid the po&s;|tillion, ob&s;erving I was li&s;tening&mdash;Poor Maria, con|tinued be (leaning his body on one &s;ide to let me &s;ee her, for he was in a line betwixt us) is &s;itting upon a bank playing her ve&s;pers upon her pipe, with her little goat be&s;ide her.</P>
<P>The young fellow uttered this with an accent, and a look &s;o perfectly in turne to a feeling heart, that I in&s;tantly made a vow, I would give him a four and twenty &s;ous piece, when I got to Moulines&mdash;</P>
<P>&mdash;And who is poor Maria? &s;aid I.</P>
<P>The love and pity of all the villages around us, &s;aid the po&s;tillion&mdash;it is but three years ago that the &s;un did not &s;hine upon &s;o fair, &s;o quick witted, and amiable a maid; and a better fate did Maria de&s;erve, than to have her banns forbid by the intrigues of the curate of the pari&s;h who publi&s;hed them&mdash;</P>
<P>He was going on, when Maria, who had made a &s;hort pau&s;e, put the pipe to her mouth, and began the air again&mdash;they were the &s;ame notes&mdash;yet were ten times &s;weeter; it is the evening &s;ervice to the virgin, &s;aid the young man&mdash;but who has taught her to play it&mdash;or how &s;he came by her pipe, no one knows; we think that Heaven has a&s;&s;i&s;ted her in both; for ever &s;ince &s;he has been un&s;ettled in her mind, it &s;eems her only con&s;olation&mdash;&s;he has never once had the pipe out of her hand, but plays that &s;ervice upon it both night and day.</P>
<P>The po&s;tillion delivered this with &s;o much di&s;|cretion and natural eloquence, that I could not help decyphering &s;omething in his face above his condi|tion, and &s;hould have &s;ifted out his hi&s;tory, had not poor Maria's taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of me.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="032623_0083_0FF3E10F8ED0B598">We had got up by this time almo&s;t to the bank where Maria was &s;itting: &s;he was in a thin white jacket, with her hair, all but two tre&s;&s;es, drawn up into a &s;ilk net, with a fine olive leaf twi&s;ted a little fanta&s;tically on one &s;ide&mdash;&s;he was beautiful; and if ever I felt the full force of an hone&s;t heart ach, it was the moment I &s;aw her&mdash;</P>
<P>&mdash;God help her! poor dam&s;el! above an hun|dred ma&s;&s;es &s;aid the po&s;tillion, have been &s;aid in the &s;everal pari&s;h churches and convents around, for her&mdash;but without effect; we have &s;till hopes, as &s;he is &s;en&s;ible for &s;hort intervals, that the virgin at la&s;t will re&s;tore her to her&s;elf; but her parents, who know her be&s;t, are hopele&s;s upon that &s;core, and think her &s;en&s;es are lo&s;t for ever.</P>
<P>As the po&s;tillion &s;poke this, Maria made a cadence &s;o melancholy, &s;o tender and querulous, that I &s;prung out of the chai&s;e to help her, and found my&s;elf &s;itt|ing betwixt her and her goat before I relap&s;ed from my enthu&s;ia&s;m.</P>
<P>Maria looked wi&s;hfully for &s;ome time at me, and then at her goat&mdash;and then at me&mdash;and then at her goat again, and &s;o on alternately.&mdash;</P>
<P>&mdash;Well, Maria, &s;aid I &s;oftly&mdash;What re&s;em|blance do you find?</P>
<P>I do intreat the candid reader to believe me, that it was from the humble&s;t conviction of what a bea&s;t man is, that I a&s;ked the que&s;tion; and that I would not have let fall an un&s;ea&s;onable plea&s;antry in the venerable pre&s;ence of mi&s;ery, to be entitled to all the wit that even Rabelais &s;cattered.</P>
<P>Adieu, Maria!&mdash;adieu, poor helple&s;s dam&s;el!&mdash; &s;ome time, but not now, I may hear thy &s;orrows from thy own lips&mdash;but I was deceived, for that moment &s;he took her pipe, and told me &s;uch a tale of woe with it, that I ro&s;e up, and with broken and irregular &s;teps walked &s;oftly to my chai&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>PART II.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN we had got within half a league of Mo|lines, at a little opening in the road leading to a thicket, I di&s;covered poor Maria &s;itting under a poplar&mdash;&s;he was &s;itting with her elbow in her lap, and head leaning on one &s;ide within her hand&mdash;a &s;mall brook ran at the foot of the tree.</P>
<P>I bade the po&s;tillion go on with the chai&s;e to Mou|lines&mdash;and La Fleur to be&s;peak my &s;upper&mdash;and that I would walk after.</P>
<P>She was dre&s;&s;ed in white, and much as my friend de&s;cribed her, except that her hair hung loo&s;e, which before was twi&s;ted within a &s;ilk net. She had &s;uper-added likewi&s;e to her jacket, a pale green ribband, which fell acro&s;s her &s;houlder to the wai&s;t, at the end of which hung her pipe. Her goat had been as faithle&s;s as her lover, and &s;he had got a little dog in lieu of him, which &s;he had kept tied by a &s;tring to her girdle; as I looked at her dog, &s;he drew him towards her with a &s;tring.&mdash;"Thou &s;halt not leave me, Sylvio," &s;aid &s;he. I looked in Maria's eyes, and &s;aw &s;he was thinking more of her father than of her lover, or her little goat; for as &s;he ut|tered them, the tears trickled down her cheeks.</P>
<P>I &s;at down clo&s;e by her, and Maria let me wipe them away, as they fell, with my handkerchief. I then &s;teeped it in my own&mdash;and then in her's&mdash;and then in mine&mdash;and then I wiped her's again&mdash;and as I did it&mdash;I felt &s;uch unde&s;cribable emotions within me, as I am &s;ure could not be accounted for from any combinations of matter and motion.</P>
<P>I am po&s;itive I have a &s;oul, nor can all the books with which materiali&s;ts have pe&s;tered the world ever convince me of the contrary.</P>
<P>When Maria had come a little to her&s;elf, I a&s;ked her if &s;he remembered a pale thin per&s;on of a man, who &s;at down betwixt her and her goat about two
<PB N="86" REF="032623_0085_0FF3E115C80D89E8">
years before: She &s;aid &s;he was un&s;ettled much at that time, but remembered it upon two accounts&mdash; that ill as &s;he was, &s;he was &s;ure the per&s;on pitied her; and next, that her goat had &s;tolen his hand|kerchief, and &s;he had beat him for the theft&mdash;&s;he had wa&s;hed it, &s;he &s;aid, in the brook, and kept it ever &s;ince in her pocket to re&s;tore it to him, in ca&s;e &s;he &s;hould ever &s;ee him again; which, &s;he added, he had half promi&s;ed her. As &s;he told me this, &s;he took the handkerchief out of her pocket to let me &s;ee it; &s;he had folded it up neatly in a couple of vine leaves, tied round with a tendril&mdash;on opening it, I &s;aw an S marked in one of the corners.</P>
<P>She had &s;ince that, &s;he told me, &s;trayed as far as Rome, and walked round St. Peter's once&mdash;and re|turned back&mdash;that &s;he found her way alone acro&s;s the Appenines&mdash;had travelled over all Lombardy without money&mdash;and through the flinty roads of Savoy without &s;hoes&mdash;how &s;he had borne it, and how &s;he had got &s;upported, &s;he could not tell&mdash;but God tempers the wind, &s;aid Maria, to the &s;horn lamb.</P>
<P>Shorn indeed! and to the quick, &s;aid I; and wa&s;t thou in my own land, where I have a cottage, I would take thee to it, and &s;helter thee, thou &s;hould&s;t eat of my bread, and drink of my own cup. I would be kind to thy Sylvio&mdash;in all thy weakne&s;&s;es and wanderings I would &s;eek after thee, and bring thee back&mdash;when the &s;un went down I would &s;ay my prayers, and when I had done, thou &s;hould&s;t play thy evening &s;ong upon thy pipe, nor would the in|cen&s;e of thy &s;acrifice be wor&s;e accepted for entering heaven along with that of a broken heart.</P>
<P>Nature melted within me as I uttered this; and Maria ob&s;erving, as I took out my handkerchief, that it was &s;teeped too much already to be of u&s;e, would needs go wa&s;h it in the &s;tream. And where will you dry it, Maria? &s;aid I. I will dry it in my bo&s;om, &s;aid &s;he&mdash;it will do me good.</P>
<P>And is your heart &s;till &s;o warm, Maria? &s;aid I.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="032623_0086_0FF3F26A6DDA76E0">I touched upon the &s;tring on which hung all her &s;orrows&mdash;&s;he looked with wi&s;tful di&s;order for &s;ome time in my face, and then, without &s;aying any thing, took her pipe and played her &s;ervice to the virgin. The &s;tring I had touched cea&s;ed to vibrate&mdash;in a moment or two Maria returned to her&s;elf&mdash;let her pipe fall&mdash;and ro&s;e up.</P>
<P>And where are you going, Maria? &s;aid I. She &s;aid, to Moulines.&mdash;Let us go, &s;aid I, together. Maria put her arm within mine, and lengthening the &s;tring, to let the dog follow&mdash;in that order we entered Moulines.</P>
<P>Though I hate &s;alutations and greetings in the market-place, yet when we had got into the middle of this, I &s;topped to take my la&s;t look, and la&s;t fare|well of Maria.</P>
<P>Maria, though not tall, was neverthele&s;s of the fir&s;t order of fine forms&mdash;affliction had touched her looks with &s;omething that was &s;carce earthly&mdash; &s;till &s;he was feminine&mdash;and &s;o much was there about her of all that the heart wi&s;hes, or the eye looks for in woman, that could the traces be ever worn out of her brain, and tho&s;e of Eliza's out of mine, &s;he &s;hould not only eat of my bread, and drink of my cup, but Maria &s;hould lie in my bo&s;om, and be unto me as a daughter.</P>
<P>Adieu, poor luckle&s;s maiden! imbibe the oil and wine which the compa&s;&s;ion of a &s;tranger, as he journieth on his way, now pours into thy wounds&mdash; the being who has twice brui&s;ed thee can only bind them up for ever.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Super&s;tition</HI> contra&s;ted. A VISION.</HEAD>
<P>THE following remarkable dream made &s;o &s;trong an impre&s;&s;ion upon the mind of Ca&s;tillus, that we will relate it in his own words.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="032623_0087_0FF3F26CAE880490">Methought I was in the mid&s;t of a very entertain|ing &s;et of company, and extremely delighted in at|tending to their lively conver&s;ation; when on a &s;udden, I perceived one of the mo&s;t &s;hocking figures imagination can frame, advancing towards me. She was dre&s;&s;ed in black; her &s;kin was contracted into a thou&s;and wrinkles; her eyes deep &s;unk in her head; and her complexion pale and livid as the countenance of death. Her looks were filled with terror and unrelenting &s;everity; and her hands arm|ed with whips and &s;corpions. As &s;oon as &s;he came near, with an horrid frown, and a voice that chilled my very blood, &s;he bade me follow her. I obeyed; &amp; &s;he led me through rugged paths, be&s;et with briars and thorns, into a deep &s;olitary valley. Wherever &s;he pa&s;&s;ed, the fading verdure withered beneath her &s;teps, her pe&s;tilential breath infected the air with malignant vapours, ob&s;cured the lu&s;tre of the &s;un, and involved the fair face of heaven in univer&s;al gloom. Di&s;mal howling re&s;ounded through the fore&s;t; from every baleful tree the night raven ut|tered his dreadful note, and the pro&s;pect was filled with de&s;olation and horror. In the mid&s;t of this tremendous &s;cene, my execrable guide addre&s;&s;ed me in the following manner:</P>
<P>"Retire with me, O ra&s;h, unthinking mortal! retire from the vain allurements of a deceitful world, and learn that plea&s;ure was not de&s;igned the portion of human life. Man was born to mourn and to be wretched. This is the condition of all below the &s;tars, and whoever endeavours to oppo&s;e it, acts in contradiction to the will of heaven. Fly then from the fatal enchantments of mirth and &s;ocial delight, and here con&s;ecrate the &s;olitary hours to lamentation and woe. Mi&s;ery is the duty of all &s;ublunary beings: and every enjoyment is an offence to the Deity, who is to be wor&s;hipped only by the mortification of every &s;en&s;e of plea&s;ure, and the everla&s;ting exerci&s;e of &s;ighs and tears."</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="032623_0088_0FF3F26EE2FAE138">This melancholy picture of life quite &s;unk my &s;pirits, and &s;eemed to annihilate every principle of joy within me. I threw my&s;elf beneath a bla&s;ted yew, where the winds blew cold and di&s;mal round my head, and dreadful apprehen&s;ions chilled my heart. Here I re&s;olved to lie till the hand of death, which I impatiently invoked, &s;hould put an end to the mi&s;eries of a life &s;o deplorably wretched. In this &s;ad condition I e&s;pied on one hand of me a deep muddy river, who&s;e waves rolled on in &s;low &s;ullen murmurs Here I determined to plunge, and was ju&s;t upon the brink, when I found my&s;elf &s;uddenly drawn back. I turned about, and was &s;urpri&s;ed by the &s;ight of the lovelie&s;t object I ever beheld. The mo&s;t engaging charms of youth and beauty appear|ed in all her form: effulgent glories &s;parkled in her eyes, and their awful &s;plendor were &s;oftened by the gentle&s;t looks of compa&s;&s;ion and peace. At her approach, the frightful &s;pectre, who had before tor|mented me, vani&s;hed away, and with her all the horrors &s;he had cau&s;ed. The gloomy clouds bright|ened into cheerful &s;un&s;hine, the groves recovered their verdure, and the whole region looked gay and blooming as the garden of Eden. I was quite tran&s;|ported at this unexpected change, and reviving plea&s;ure began to gladden my thoughts; when, with a look of inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;weetne&s;s, my beauteous de|liverer thus uttered her divine in&s;tructions.</P>
<P>"My name is Religion. I am the offspring of Truth and Love, and the parent of Benevolence, Hope, and Joy. That mon&s;ter from who&s;e power I have freed you, is called Super&s;tition; &s;he is the child of Di&s;content, and her followers are Fear and Sorrow. Thus, different as we are, &s;he has often the in&s;olence to a&s;&s;ume my name and character, and &s;educe unhappy mortals to think the &s;ame, till &s;he at length drives them to the borders of de&s;pair, that dreadful aby&s;s into which you were ju&s;t going to &s;ink.</P>

For what end has the lavi&s;h hand of Providence diffu&s;ed &s;uch innumera|ble objects of delight, but that all might rejoice in the privilege of exi&s;tence, and be filled with grati|tude to the beneficent Author of it? Thus to enjoy the ble&s;&s;ings he has &s;ent, is virtue and obedience; and to reject them merely as means of plea&s;ure, is pitiable ignorance, or ab&s;urd perver&s;ene&s;s. Infin|ite goodne&s;s is the &s;ource of created exi&s;tence. The proper tendency of every rational being, from the highe&s;t order of raptured &s;eraphs, to the meane&s;t rank of men, is to ri&s;e ince&s;&s;antly from lower degrees of happine&s;s to higher. They have each faculties a&s;&s;igned them for various orders of delights."</P>
<P>What! cried Ca&s;tillus, is this the language of Religion? Does &s;he lead her votaries through flow|ery paths, and bid them pa&s;s an unlaborious life? Where are the painful toils of virtue, the mortifica|tions of penitents, and the &s;elf-denying exerci&s;es of &s;aints and heroes?</P>
<P>"The true enjoyment of a rea&s;onable being (an&s;|wered &s;he mildly) does not con&s;i&s;t in unbounded indulgence, or luxurious ea&s;e, in the tumult of pa&s;|&s;ions, the languor of indolence, or the flutter of light amu&s;ements. Yielding to immoral plea&s;ure corrupts the mind; living to animal and trifling ones deba&s;es it; both in their degrees di&s;qualify it for its genuine good, and con&s;ign it over to wretch|edne&s;s. Whoever would be really happy, mu&s;t make the diligent and regular exerci&s;e of his &s;uperior powers his chief attention, adoring the perfections of his Maker, expre&s;&s;ing good will to his fellow creatures, and cultivating inward rectitude. To his lower faculties he mu&s;t allow &s;uch gratifications as will, by refre&s;hing them, invigorate his noble pur|&s;uits.

In the regions inhabited by angelic natures, unmingled felicity for ever blooms; joy flows there with a perpetual and abundant &s;tream, nor needs there any mound to check its cour&s;e. Beings con|&s;cious of a frame of mind originally di&s;ea&s;ed, as all the human race has cau&s;e to be, mu&s;t u&s;e the regi|men of a &s;tricter felf-government. Whoever has been guilty of voluntary exce&s;&s;es, mu&s;t patiently &s;ubmit both to the painful workings of nature, and needful &s;everities of medicine, in order to his cure. Still he is entitled to a moderate &s;hare of whatever alleviating accommodations this fair man&s;ion of his merciful Parent affords, con&s;i&s;tent with his recovery. And in proportion as this recovery advances, the livelie&s;t joy will &s;pring from his &s;ecret &s;en&s;e of an amended and improved heart. So far from the horrors of de&s;pair is the condition even of the guilty. Shudder poor mortal at the thought of the gulph into which thou wa&s;t ju&s;t now going to plunge.</P>
<P>"While the mo&s;t faulty have every encourage|ment to amend, the more innocent &s;oul will be &s;up|ported with &s;till &s;weeter con&s;olations under all its experience of human infirmities, &s;upported by the gladdening a&s;&s;urances, that every &s;incere endeavour to outgrow them, &s;hall be a&s;&s;i&s;ted, accepted, and rewarded. To &s;uch a one, the lowe&s;t &s;elf-aba&s;ement is but a deep laid foundation for the mo&s;t elevated hopes; &s;ince they who faithfully examine and ac|knowledge what they are, &s;hall be enabled under my conduct to become what they de&s;ire.

Society is the true &s;phere of human virtue. In &s;ocial, active life, difficulties will be perpetually met with, re&s;traints of many kinds will be nece&s;&s;ary, and &s;tudying to behave right in re&s;pect of the&s;e, is a di&s;cipline of the human heart, u&s;eful to others, and improving to it&s;elf. Suffering is no duty, but where it is nece&s;&s;ary to avoid guilt, or to do good, nor plea&s;ure a crime, but where it &s;trengthens the influence of bad inclinations, or le&s;|&s;ens the generous activity of virtue. The happine&s;s allotted to man in his pre&s;ent &s;tate, is indeed faint and low, compared with his immortal pro&s;pect and noble capacities; but yet, whatever portion of it the di&s;tributing hand of heaven offers to each indi|vidual, is a needful &s;upport and refre&s;hment for the pre&s;ent moment, &s;o far as it may not hinder the attaining his final de&s;tination.</P>
<P>"Return then with me from continual mi&s;ery to moderate enjoyment, and grateful alacrity; return from the contr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cted views of &s;olitude, to the proper duties of a relative and dependent being.

<HEAD>On the extreme Folly of being di&s;&s;atisfied with our pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances, exemplified in the re|markable Hi&s;tory of Horatio,</HEAD>
<BYLINE>written by Him&s;elf.</BYLINE>
<P>I AM the &s;on of a younger brother of a good fam|ily, who, at his decea&s;e, left me a little fortune of about one hundred pounds per annum. I was put early to Eton &s;chool, where I learned Latin and Greek, from whence I went to the Univer&s;ity, where I learned not totally to forget them. I came to my fortune while I was at college, and having no inclination to follow any profe&s;&s;ion, I removed my|&s;elf to town, and lived for &s;ome time as mo&s;t young fellows do, by &s;pending four times my income. But it was my happine&s;s, before it was too late, to fall in love with, and to marry a very amiable young creature, who&s;e fortune was ju&s;t &s;ufficient to repair the breach made in my own. With this agreeable companion I retreated to the country, and endea|voured as well as I was able, to &s;quare my wi&s;hes to my circum&s;tances. In this endeavour I &s;ucceeded &s;o well, that excepting a few private hankerings after a little more than I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and now and then a &s;igh when a coach and &s;ix happened to drive by me in my walks, I was a very happy man.</P>
<P>I can truly &s;ay, that though my family oeconomy was not much to be boa&s;ted of, and in con&s;equence of it, we were frequently driven to great &s;traits and difficulties, I experienced more real &s;atisfaction in this humble &s;ituation, than I have ever done &s;ince in more enviable circum&s;tances. We were &s;ome|times indeed a little in debt, but when money came in, the plea&s;ure of di&s;charging what we owed, was more than equivalent for the&s;e pains it put us to; and though the narrowne&s;s of our circum&s;tances &s;ubjected us to many cares and anxieties, it &s;erved to keep the body in action as well as the mind; for, as our garden was &s;omewhat large, and required
<PB N="94" REF="032623_0093_0FF3F27A0EAC2638">
more hands to keep it in order than we could afford to hire, we daily laboured in it our&s;elves, and drew health from our nece&s;&s;ities.</P>
<P>I had a little boy who was the delight of my heart, and who probably might have been &s;poiled by nur|&s;ing, if the attention of his parents had not been otherwi&s;e employed. His mother was naturally of a &s;ickly con&s;titution, but the affairs of her family, as they engro&s;&s;ed all her thoughts, gave her no time for complaint. The ordinary troubles of life, which to tho&s;e who have nothing el&s;e to think of, are almo&s;t in&s;upportable, were le&s;s terrible to us than to per&s;ons of ea&s;ier circum&s;tances, for it is a certain truth, that where the mind is divided among many cares, the anxiety is lighter than when there is only one to contend with. Even in the happie&s;t &s;ituation, in the mid&s;t of ea&s;e, health, and affluence, the mind is generally ingenious in tormenting it&s;elf, lo&s;ing the immediate enjoyment of tho&s;e invaluable ble&s;&s;ings, by the painful &s;ugge&s;tion that they are too great for continuance.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the reflections that I have made &s;ince, for I do not attempt to deny, that I &s;ighed frequent|ly for an addition to my fortune. The death of a di&s;tant relation, which happened five years after our marriage, gave me this addition, and made me for a time the happie&s;t man living. My income was now increa&s;ed to &s;ix hundred a year; and, I hoped, with a little oeconomy, to be able to make a figure with it. But the ill health of my wife, which in le&s;s ea&s;y circum&s;tances had not touched me &s;o near|ly, was now con&s;tantly in my thoughts, and &s;oured all my enjoyments. The con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s too of hav|ing &s;uch an e&s;tate to leave my boy, made me &s;o anx|ious to pre&s;erve him, that in&s;tead of &s;uffering him to run at plea&s;ure where he plea&s;ed, and to grow hardy by exerci&s;e, I almo&s;t de&s;troyed him by confine|ment. We now did nothing in our garden, becau&s;e we were in circum&s;tances to have it kept by others;
<PB N="95" REF="032623_0094_0FF3E038CD7FA0A0">
but as air and exerci&s;e were nece&s;&s;ary for our healths, we re&s;olved to abridge our&s;elves of &s;ome unnece&s;&s;ary articles, and to &s;et up an equipage. This, in time, brought with it a train of expences, which we had neither prudence to fore&s;ee, nor courage to prevent. For, as it enabled us to extend the circuit of our vi&s;its, it greatly increa&s;ed our acquaintance, and &s;ub|jected us to the nece&s;&s;ity of making continual enter|tainments at home, in return for tho&s;e which we were invited to abroad. The charges that attended this new manner of living, were much too great for the income we po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; in&s;omuch, that we found our&s;elves in a very &s;hort time more nece&s;&s;itous than ever. Pride would not &s;uffer us to lay down an equipage, and to live in a manner un&s;uitable to it, was what we could not think of. To pay the debts I had contracted, I was &s;oon forced to mortgage my e&s;tate; and, at la&s;t, to &s;ell the be&s;t part of it; and, as it was utterly impo&s;&s;ible to keep up the parade any longer, we thought it advi&s;eable to remove of a &s;udden, to &s;ell our coach in town, and to look out for a new &s;ituation, at a greater di&s;tance from our acquaintance.</P>
<P>But unfortunately for my peace, I carried a habit of expence along with me, and was very near being reduced to ab&s;olute want, when by the unexpected death of an uncle, and his two &s;ons, who died within a few weeks of each other, I &s;ucceeded to an e&s;tate of 7000l. a year.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation I might be called a very happy man, and &s;o indeed I was; I &s;et about the regulation of my family with the mo&s;t plea&s;ing &s;atisfaction. The &s;plendor of my equipage, the magnificence of my plate, the crowd of &s;ervants that attended me, the elegance of my hou&s;e and furniture, the gran|deur of my park and gardens, the luxury of my ta|ble, and the court that was every where paid me, gave me inexpre&s;&s;ible delight &s;o long as they were novelties; but no &s;ooner were they become habitual
<PB N="96" REF="032623_0095_0FF3F27DC9E1BD48">
to me, than I lo&s;t all manner of reli&s;h for them, and I di&s;covered in a very little time, that by having no|thing to wi&s;h for I had nothing to enjoy. My appe|tite grew palled by &s;atiety, a perpetual crowd of vi&s;itors robbed me of all dome&s;tic enjoyment, my &s;ervants plagued me, and my &s;teward cheated me.</P>
<P>But the cour&s;e of greatne&s;s did not end here. Daily experience convinced me that I was compelled to live more for others than for my&s;elf. My uncle had been a great party man, and a zealous oppo&s;er of all mini&s;terial mea&s;ures; as his e&s;tate was the large&s;t of any gentleman in the county, he &s;upported an intere&s;t in it beyond any of his competitors. My father had been greatly obliged by the court party, which determined me in gratitude to declare my&s;elf on that &s;ide; but the difficulties I had to encounter were too many and too great for me; in&s;omuch that I have been baffled and defeated in almo&s;t every thing I have undertook. To de&s;ert the cau&s;e in which I have embarked would di&s;grace me; and to go greater lengths in it will almo&s;t undo me. I am engaged in a perpetual &s;tate of warfare with the principal gentlemen of the county, and am cur|&s;ed by my tenants and dependants for compelling them at every election to vote (as they are plea&s;ed to tell me) contrary to their con&s;ciences.</P>
<P>My wife and I had once plea&s;ed our&s;elves with the thoughts of being u&s;eful in the neighbourhood, by dealing out our charity to the poor and indu&s;trious; but the perpetual hurry in which we live, renders us incapable of looking out for objects our&s;elves, and the agents we intru&s;t are either pocketing our bounty, or be&s;towing it on the unde&s;erving. At night when we retire to re&s;t, we are venting our com|plaints on the mi&s;eries of the day, and praying heartily for the return of that peace, which was the only companion of our humble&s;t &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Where pain, &s;ickne&s;s, and ab&s;olute want, are out of the que&s;tion, no external change of circum&s;tances
<PB N="97" REF="032623_0096_0FF3F2809C252B70">
can make a man more la&s;tingly happy than he was before. It is to our ignorance of this truth, that the univer&s;al di&s;&s;atisfaction of mankind is principally to be a&s;cribed. Care is the lot of human life; and he that a&s;pires to greatne&s;s in hopes to get rid of it, is like one, who throws him&s;elf into a furnace to avoid the &s;hivering ague.</P>
<P>The only &s;atisfaction I can enjoy in my pre&s;ent &s;ituation is, that it has not plea&s;ed Heaven in its wrath to make me a king.</P>

<HEAD>On the Amu&s;ements of <HI>Sunday.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is a&s;toni&s;hing to conceive what quantities of bread, chee&s;e, cakes, ale, &amp;c. are con&s;tantly con&s;umed on a Sunday, in all the little towns near London. It is incredible how many thou&s;and buns are devoured in that one day at Chel&s;ea, and the neighbouring villages, and how much beer is &s;wal|lowed at I&s;lington, and Mile-end, as well as what oceans of tea and coffee, and cart loads of hot loaves at White Conduit Hou&s;e, Bagnigge, Wells, Canon|bury Hou&s;e, the Spa, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Could an exact e&s;timate be formed, the review would be very entertaining, and we mu&s;t conclude that the Sabbath is a mo&s;t excellent in&s;titution, &s;ince the very breaking of it is the &s;upport of half the villages about the metropolis.</P>
<P>That part of the fourth commandment which prohibits the doing any work on Sunday, is very &s;trictly ob&s;erved by the common people, who &s;eem to under&s;tand it as if it gave them an uncontrolled licence to plea&s;urable indulgences. They take this opportunity of walking as far as the i&s;land of St. Helena, or eating white bait at Blackwall. As they all aim at going into the country, nothing can be a greater misfortune to the meaner part of the inhab|itants

of London and We&s;tmin&s;ter, than a rainy Sunday. How many city apprentices, merchants' clerks, as well as &s;everal other people of different profe&s;&s;ions, would be di&s;appointed of a ride once a week, if the legi&s;lature were to limit the hired hor&s;es, and one hor&s;e chai&s;es, from working on that day to a certain number.</P>
<P>The plodding trade&s;man is carried to his &s;nug box, which has nothing rural about it except the ivy which over-runs the front, and is placed as near to the road as po&s;&s;ible, where the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing carriages pop under his window, compen&s;ates for being almo&s;t &s;mothered with du&s;t. The young ap|prentices, clerks, &amp;c. above alluded to, are &s;een whipping and &s;purring their broken winded jades up the hills; and the good natured hu&s;band, toge|ther with his mate, are dragged along the road to the admiration of the foot pa&s;&s;enger, who trudges patiently with a child in one arm, while his beloved doxy leans on the other.</P>
<P>The country in it&s;elf has not any peculiarly at|tractive charms, for the people who thus pro&s;titute it, think them&s;elves out of the world if they are not within the &s;ound of Bow bell; but it in general &s;erves for an excu&s;e for eating and drinking, and they get out of town merely becau&s;e they have nothing to do at home; a brick-kiln &s;mells as &s;weet to them as a farm-yard; they would pop by a barn or an hay|&s;tack, without notice, but they rejoice at the &s;ight of every hedge alehou&s;e that promi&s;es good home brewed.

<P>To people of one cla&s;s, Sunday wears the &s;ame face as the re&s;t of the week. It is really a matter of wonder and a&s;toni&s;hment, that no public place, &s;uch as Ranelagh, and Vauxhall, &s;hould not be open of a Sunday evening, where per&s;ons of fa&s;hion might pa&s;s away the hours that hang &s;o heavy upon their hands, till the time arrives when they might with propriety &s;it down to the card table, for it certainly is more decent to make a&s;&s;ignations there than at church, which we are &s;orry to &s;ay is too much fre|quented for that purpo&s;e alone; though this is pretty well remedied by the concour&s;e of people who attend the Mall and Ken&s;ington Gardens. Now we are upon the &s;ubject, we may make &s;ome ob&s;ervations upon the modern method of church going, which as it is practi&s;ed, may be reckoned among our Sunday amu&s;ements, as people are induced <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o appear in a place of wor&s;hip, from the &s;ame motives that they frequent the public places. To &s;ome it an&s;wers all the purpo&s;es of a route or an a&s;&s;embly, to &s;ee and be &s;een by their acquaintance, and from their bows, nods, court&s;ies, and loud conver&s;ation, one might conclude that they imagined them&s;elves in a draw|ing

<P>A well di&s;po&s;ed Chri&s;tian will go a mile from his own hou&s;e to St. Paul's, for the &s;ake of the anthem rather than the &s;ermon, and many a Methodi&s;t will trudge to the Lock chapel, not becau&s;e M&mdash; is to preach, but becau&s;e Lockhart plays on the organ, and Mi&s;s&mdash; leads the enchanting train of female &s;ingers.</P>
<P>Upon modern principles it appears very &s;trange, that going to church &s;hould be deemed a kind of amu&s;ement, at lea&s;t it is &s;o wholly incompatible with the polite &s;y&s;tem of life, that a per&s;on of fa&s;hion, as affairs are now managed, finds it ab&s;olutely impo&s;|&s;ible to comply with the practice.

A Chine&s;e, who had long &s;tudied the works of Confucius, who knew the characters of fourteen thou&s;and words, and could read a great part of every book that came in his way, once took it into his head to travel into Europe, and ob&s;erve the cu&s;|toms of a people whom he thought not very much inferior, even to his own countrymen, in the arts of refining upon every pa&s;&s;ion. Upon his arrival at Am&s;terdam, his pa&s;&s;ion for letters naturally led him to a book&s;eller's &s;hop; and, as he could &s;peak a little Dutch, he civilly a&s;ked the book&s;eller for the works of the immortal Xixofou. The book&s;eller a&s;&s;ured him he had never heard the book mentioned before. "What, have you never heard of that immortal poet?" returned the other much &s;urpri&s;ed, "that light of the eyes, that favourite of kings, that ro&s;e of perfection!

<P>Neverthele&s;s, it is very obvious with all the&s;e ad|vantages, that the clergy are no where &s;o little thought of, by the populace, as here; and, though our divines are foremo&s;t, with re&s;pect to abilities, yet they are found la&s;t in the effects of their mini&s;try; the vulgar, in general, appearing no way impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of religious duty. I am not for whining at the depravity of the times, or for endeavouring to paint a pro&s;pect more gloomy than in nature; but certain it is, no per&s;on who has travelled will con|tradict me, when I aver, that the lower orders of mankind, in other countries, te&s;tify, on every occa|&s;ion, the profounde&s;t awe of religion; while in Eng|land they are &s;carcely awakened into a &s;en&s;e of its duties, even in circum&s;tances of the greate&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s.</P>
<P>Foreigners are apt to attribute this di&s;&s;olute and fearle&s;s conduct to climate and con&s;titution; may not the vulgar, being pretty much neglected in our exhortations from the pulpit, be a con&s;piring cau&s;e? Our divines &s;eldom &s;toop to their mean capacities; and they who want in&s;truction mo&s;t, find lea&s;t in our religious a&s;&s;emblies.</P>
<P>It &s;eems to me a principal duty, whatever may become of the higher orders of mankind, who are generally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of collateral motives to virtue, the vulgar &s;hould be particularly regarded, who&s;e beha|viour in civil life is totally hinged upon their hopes and fears. Tho&s;e who con&s;titute the ba&s;is of the great fabric of &s;ociety, &s;hould be particularly regard|ed; for, in policy, as in architecture, that maxim holds good, ruin is mo&s;t fatal when it begins from the bottom.</P>
<P>It is the misfortune of men of real &s;en&s;e and un|der&s;tanding to prefer a prudent mediocrity to a
<PB N="106" REF="032623_0105_0FF3F28C8146FB08">
precarious popularity; and, fearing to outdo their duty, leave it half done. Their di&s;cour&s;es from the pulpit are generally dry, methodical, and unaffecting; delivered with the mo&s;t in&s;ipid calmne&s;s; in&s;omuch, that, &s;hould the peaceful preacher lift his head over the cu&s;hion, which alone he &s;eems to addre&s;s, he might di&s;cover his audience, in&s;tead of being awaken|ed to remor&s;e, actually &s;leeping over his methodical and laboured compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Some people call this method of preaching, an ad|dre&s;s to rea&s;on, and not to the pa&s;&s;ions; this is &s;tiled the making of converts from conviction: but &s;uch are indifferently acquainted with human nature, who are not &s;en&s;ible, that men &s;eldom rea&s;on about their deb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">cheries till they are committed; rea&s;on is but a w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">k antagoni&s;t when head&s;trong pa&s;&s;ion dic|tates; in all &s;uch ca&s;es we &s;hould arm one pa&s;&s;ion again&s;t another; it is with the human mind as in nature, from the mixture of two oppo&s;ites the re&s;ult is mo&s;t frequently neutral tranquility. Tho&s;e who attempt to rea&s;on us out of our follies, begin at the wrong end, &s;ince the attempt naturally pre&s;uppo&s;es us capable of this, which is one great point of the cure.</P>
<P>In order to become a popular preacher, there are but few talents requi&s;ite, for the people are ea&s;ily plea&s;ed if they perceive any endeavours in the orator to plea&s;e them; the meane&s;t qualifications will work this effect, if the preacher &s;incerely &s;ets about it. Perhaps little, indeed very little more is required, than &s;incerity and a&s;&s;urance; and a becoming &s;in|cerity is always certain of producing a becoming a&s;&s;urance. "Si vis me fiere, dolendum e&s;t primum tibi ip&s;i," is &s;o trite a quotation, that it almo&s;t de|mands an apology to repeat it; yet, though all allow the ju&s;tice of the remark, how few do we find put it in practice! Our orators, with the mo&s;t faulty ba&s;h|ful<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;s, &s;eem impre&s;&s;ed rather with an awe of their audience than with a ju&s;t re&s;pect for the truths they

are about to deliver; they, of all profe&s;&s;ions, &s;eem the mo&s;t ba&s;hful, who have the greate&s;t right to glory in their commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>It is the cu&s;tom with the French preachers gener|ally to a&s;&s;ume all that dignity which becomes men who are amba&s;&s;adors from Chri&s;ts whil&s;t the Engli&s;h divines, like erroneous envoys, &s;eem more &s;olicitous not to offend the court to which they are &s;ent, than to drive home the intere&s;ts of their employer. The bi&s;hop of Ma&s;&s;ilon, in the fir&s;t &s;ermon he ever preach|ed, found the whole audience, upon his getting into the pulpit in a di&s;po&s;ition no way favourable to his intentions&punc; their nods, whi&s;pers, or drow&s;y beha|viour, &s;hewed him that there was no great profit to be expected from his &s;owing in a &s;oil &s;o improper; however, he &s;oon changed the di&s;po&s;ition of his au|dience by his manner of beginning: "If," &s;ays he, "a cau&s;e, the mo&s;t important that could be con|ceived, were to be tried at the bar before qualified judges; if this cau&s;e intere&s;ted our&s;elves in particu|lar; if the eyes of the whole kingdom were fixed upon the event; if the mo&s;t eminent council were employ|ed on both &s;ides; and if we had heard from our infancy of this yet undetermined trial; would you not all &s;it with due attention, and warm expectation, to the pleadings on each &s;ide? Would not all your hopes and fears be hinged upon the final deci&s;ion? And yet, let me tell you, you have this moment a cau&s;e of much greater importance before you; a cau&s;e where not one nation, but all the world, are &s;pectators; tried, not before a fallible tribunal, but the awful throne of heaven, where not your temporal and tran&s;itory intere&s;ts are the &s;ubject of debate, but your eternal happine&s;s or mi&s;ery, where the cau&s;e is &s;till undetermined; but, perhaps the very moment I am &s;peaking may fix the irrevocable decree that &s;hall la&s;t for ever; and yet, notwith&s;tanding all this, you can hardly &s;it with patience to hear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> tidings of your own &s;alvation; I plead the cau&s;e of heaven, and yet am &s;carcely attended to, &amp;c."</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="032623_0107_0FF46FB208816DE0">It may be urged, that the &s;tile, the abruptne&s;s of a beginning like this, in the clo&s;et would appear ab&s;urd; but in the pulpit it is attended with the mo&s;t la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ions: that &s;tile which, in the clo&s;et, might ju&s;tly be called flim&s;y, &s;eems the true mode of eloquence here. I never read a fine compo&s;ition, under the title of a &s;ermon, that I do not think the author has mi&s;called his piece; for the talents to be u&s;ed in writing well, entirely differ from tho&s;e of &s;peaking well. The qualifications for &s;peaking, as has been already ob&s;erved, are ea&s;ily acquired; they are accompli&s;hments which may be taken up by every candidate who will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> at the pains of &s;tooping. Impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of the truths he is about to deliver, a preacher di&s;regards the applau&s;e or contempt of his audience, and he in&s;en&s;ibly a&s;&s;umes a ju&s;t and manly &s;incerity. With this talent alone we &s;ee what crowds are drawn around enthu&s;ia&s;ts, even de&s;titute of common &s;en&s;e; what numbers converted to Chri&s;tianity. Folly may &s;ometimes &s;et an example for wi&s;dom to prac|ti&s;e, and our regular divines may borrow in&s;truction even from methodi&s;ts, who go their circuits, and preach prizes among the populace. Let clergymen do their duty, and the number of the&s;e people will decrea&s;e.</P>
<P>Some perhaps will &s;ay, that, by confining the ex|cellencies of a preacher to proper a&s;&s;urance, earn|e&s;tne&s;s, and openne&s;s of &s;tyle, I make the qualifica|tions too trifling for e&s;timation: there will be &s;ome|thing called oratory brought up on this occa&s;ion; action, attitude, grace, elocution, may be repeated as ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to complete the character; but let us not be deceived; common &s;en&s;e is &s;eldom &s;wayed by fine tones, mu&s;ical periods, ju&s;t attitudes, or the di&s;play of a white handkerchief; oratorial behaviour, except in very able hands indeed, gener|ally &s;inks into aukward and paltry affectation.</P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary to remark, that the&s;e rules are cal|culated

only for him who would in&s;truct the vulgar, who &s;tand in mo&s;t need of in&s;truction. To addre&s;s philo&s;ophers, and to obtain the character of a polite preacher among the polite&mdash;(a much more u&s;ele&s;s, though more &s;ought-for character)&mdash;requires a dif|ferent method of proceeding. All I &s;hall ob&s;erve on this head is, to intreat the polemic divine, in his controver&s;y with the Dei&s;ts, to act rather offen&s;ively than to defend; to pu&s;h home the grounds of his belief, and the impracticability of theirs, rather than to &s;pend time in &s;olving the objections of every op|ponent. It is ten to one," &s;ays a late writer on the art of war, "but that the a&s;&s;ailant who attacks the enemy in his trenches, is always victorious."</P>
<P>I am clearly of opinion, that upon the whole, our clergy might employ them&s;elves more to the benefit of &s;ociety, by declining all controver&s;y, than by ex|hibiting even the profounde&s;t &s;kill in polemic di&s;|putes; their conte&s;ts with each other often turn on &s;peculative trifles; and their di&s;putes with the Dei&s;ts are almo&s;t at an end, &s;ince they can have no more than victory, and that they are already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, as their antagoni&s;ts have been driven into a confe&s;|&s;ion of the nece&s;&s;ity of revelation, or an open avowal of athei&s;m.

<HEAD>New and genuine Anecdotes of <HI>Dean Swift.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT appears by a memorandum in one of the ac|count books which Dean Swift always made up yearly, that his mother died in the year 1710. On each page of this memorandum book, the Dean en|tered minutely all his receipts and expences in every
<PB N="110" REF="032623_0109_0FF3F294D10A59B8">
month, beginning his year from the fir&s;t of Novem|ber. He ob&s;erved this method all his life time to his la&s;t illne&s;s. At the foot of that page which includes his expences of the month of May 1710, at the glebe hou&s;e of Laracor, in the county of Meath, where he was then re&s;ident, are the&s;e remarkable words, which &s;hew, at the &s;ame time, his filial piety, and the re|ligious u&s;e which he thought it his duty to make of that melancholy event. "Memorandum, On Wedne&s;day, between &s;even and eight in the evening, May 10, 1710, I received a letter in my chamber at Laracor (M Percival, and J. Beaumont, being by) from Mrs. F&mdash;, dated May 9, with one inclo&s;ed &s;ent by Mrs. Mouall at Leice&s;ter, to Mrs. F&mdash;, giving an account that my dear mother, Mrs. Abi|gail Swift, died that morning, Monday, April 24, 1710, about 10 o'clock, after a long &s;ickne&s;s, being ill all winter, and lame, and extremely ill about a month or &s;ix weeks before her death. God grant I may live to be as well prepared for it as I confident|ly believe her to have been: If the way to heaven be thro' piety, truth, ju&s;tice, &amp; charity, &s;he is there. J.S."</P>
<P>The Dean always treated his mother during her life, with the utmo&s;t duty and affection; and &s;he &s;ometimes came to Ireland to vi&s;it him after his &s;et|tlement at Laracor. She lodged at Mr. Brent's a Printer in George Lane, Dublin. She a&s;ked Mrs. Brent, the landlady, whether &s;he could keep a &s;ecret: She replied, &s;he could very well. Upon which &s;he enjoined her not to make the matter public which &s;he was now going to communicate to her. "I have a &s;park in this town, that I carried on a corre&s;pondence with while I was in England; he will be here pre&s;ently to pay his ad|dre&s;&s;es, for he hath heard by this time of my arrival; but I would not have the matter known." Soon after this a rap was heard at the door, and Dean Swift walked up &s;tairs; Mrs. Brent retired, but after a little time &s;he was called, and then Mrs. Swift intro|duced her to her &s;on, and &s;aid, "This is my &s;park
<PB N="111" REF="032623_0110_0FF3F2965D4FA598">
I was telling you of, this is my lover, and indeed the only one I &s;hall ever admit to pay their addre&s;&s;es to me." The Doctor &s;miled at his mother's humour, and afterwards paid his duty to her every day, un|&s;u&s;pected by Mrs. Brent, whom he invited &s;ome years afterwards to take care of his family affairs, when he became Dean of St. Patrick's; and when Mrs. Brent died, he continued her daughter, a poor widow, in the &s;ame office.</P>
<P>Dr. Sacheverel, in con&s;equence of a mo&s;t inflam|matory &s;ermon, preached before the Lord Mayor, on November 5, 1709. was impeached at the bar of the Hou&s;e of Lords, in the name of the Commons of Great Britain, for high crimes and mi&s;demeanours, &amp;c. Having been tried before the Lords, and found guilty, he was &s;ilenced for the &s;pace of three years, and his &s;ermon was condemned to be burnt by the hands of the common hangman, which &s;entence was rigidly executed.</P>
<P>When this affair was over, the mini&s;try took very little notice of him, and treated him with great indifference; but upon the rectory of St. Andrew's, Holborn, being vacant, the Doctor applied to them for that living, but they paid no regard to his &s;olici|tation. Upon which he went to Dr. Swift, with whom he had a very &s;lender acquaintance, to reque&s;t his intere&s;t with the government for that pari&s;h; and &s;et forth how much he had &s;uffered for them, and their cau&s;e. Dr. Swift immediately carried this letter to Lord Bolingbroke, then Secretary of State, who railed much at Sacheverel, calling him a bu&s;y intermeddling fellow; a prig, and an incendia|ry, who had &s;et the kingdom in a flame, which could not be extingui&s;hed, and therefore de&s;erved cen&s;ure in&s;tead of a reward, To which Swift replied, "True, my Lord, but let me tell you a &s;tory. In a &s;ea-fight in the reign of Charles II. there was a very bloody engegement between the Dutch and the En|gli&s;h fleets; in the heat of which a Scotch &s;eaman was very &s;everely bit by a lou&s;e in his neck, which
<PB N="112" REF="032623_0111_0FF46FBE65C75F18">
he caught, and &s;tooping down to crack it between his nails, many of the &s;ailors near him had their heads taken off by a chain-&s;hot from the enemy, which &s;cattered their brains and blood about him. On this he had compa&s;&s;ion upon the poor lou&s;e, re|turned him to his place, and bid him live there at di&s;cretion; for as he had &s;aved his life, he was bound in gratitude to &s;ave his." The recital of this threw my Lord B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lingbroke into a fit of laughter, who when it was over, &s;aid, "The lou&s;e &s;hall have the living for your &s;tory," and &s;oon after Sacheverel was pre&s;ented to it.</P>
<P>In Dublin, as in other large cities, fires have &s;ome|times happened, by which people of all denomina|tions have been &s;ufferers; upon which melancholy occa&s;ion, the Dean always exerted him&s;elf not only in per&s;on, by going from hou&s;e to hou&s;e to make collections for them, but wrote and recommended their melancholy ca&s;es to the public. He would go to the afflicted &s;ufferers, offer them his &s;ervices, and would be the fir&s;t to &s;ub&s;cribe in a mo&s;t princely and generous manner to their relief, which worthy example of his the benevolent citizens of Dublin would imitate.</P>
<P>His charity appears to have been a &s;ettled princi|ple of duty, more than an in&s;tinctive effort of good nature; but as it was then founded and &s;upported, it had extraordinary merit, and &s;eldom f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">led to exert it&s;elf in a manner that contributed mo&s;t to render it mo&s;t beneficial. He did not lavi&s;h his money upon the idle and worthle&s;s; he nicely di&s;|criminated characters, and was &s;eldom the dupe of impo&s;ition. Hence his genero&s;ity always turned to an u&s;eful account, while it relieved di&s;tre&s;s it encour|aged indu&s;try, and rewarded virtue.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, he was a very peculiar man in every re&s;pect. Some people have &s;aid, "What a man he would have been had he been without tho&s;e whims and infirmities, which &s;haded both his genius and
<PB N="113" REF="032623_0112_0FF3F29B67ACA978">
his character." But perhaps the peculiarities com|plained of were in&s;eparable from his genius. The vigour and fertility of the root could not fail now and then of throwing out &s;uperfluous &s;uckers that produced the&s;e, produced al&s;o the more beautiful branches, and the fruit with all its richne&s;s.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t even be acknowledged, that the Dean's fancy hurried him into great ab&s;urdities and incon|&s;i&s;tencies, for which nothing could atone but extra|ordinary talents and virtues di&s;covered in other in|&s;tances. The rancour he di&s;covered towards the Di&s;&s;enters is well known; no &s;ect or party of men could have merited it in the degree in which he always &s;hewed it to them; for in &s;ome in&s;tances it bordered on downright per&s;ecution. He doubtle&s;s had his rea&s;ons for expo&s;ing their principles into ridicule, and might perhaps have &s;ufficient grounds for &s;ome of his accu&s;ations again&s;t their principal leaders in Ireland; but nothing could ju&s;tify his vir|ulence again&s;t the whole body. Indi&s;criminate re|flections in a community at large, are generally the offspring of ignorance or malice. It is impo&s;&s;ible to put down his prejudices to the account of the former, and we &s;hould be &s;orry to impute them to a wor&s;e principle. So great was the Dean's chagrin in the choice which the Corporation of Dublin had made of a Di&s;&s;enter for a phy&s;ician to an ho&s;pital in that city, that he immediately altered a will in which he had nominated them tru&s;tees to a public charity of his own; this action &s;trongly marked his temper, but he &s;hould have con&s;idered that the Corporation had acted not in a religious, but in a civil capacity, &s;o that it was at lea&s;t po&s;&s;ible a man might be a very &s;kilful phy&s;ician, without being an orthodox church-man.</P>
<P>The Dean's particular aver&s;ion to Lord Wharton, is well known and accounted for by a curious anec|dote, communicated by the late Dr. Salter.</P>
<P>"Lord Somers, recommended Dr. Swift, at his
<PB N="114" REF="032623_0113_0FF3F29CEF76F488">
own reque&s;t, to Lord Wharton, when that Earl went as Lord Lieutenant to Ireland, in 1708, but without &s;ucce&s;s; and the an&s;wer his Lord&s;hip is &s;aid to have given, was never forgotten or forgiven by Dr. Swift, but &s;eems to have laid the foundation for that par|ticular rancour with which he always mentions Lord Wharton. I &s;aw and read (&s;ays Dr. Salter) two letters of Jonathan Swift, then Prebendary of St. Patrick's, Dublin, to Lord Somers; the fir&s;t ear|ne&s;tly intreating his favour, pleading his poverty, and profe&s;&s;ing the mo&s;t unalterable attachment to his Lord&s;hip's per&s;on, friends, and cau&s;e; the &s;econd acknowledging Lord Somers's kindne&s;s in having recommended him, and concluding with the like &s;olemn profe&s;&s;ions."</P>
<P>"Not more than a year before, Swift de&s;erted Lord Somers, and all his friends, writing avowedly on the contrary &s;ide, and (as he boa&s;ts him&s;elf) libel|ling all the junto round. I &s;aw al&s;o the very letters which Lord Somers wrote to the Earl of Wharton, in which Swift is very heartily and warmly recom|mended; and I well remember the &s;hort and very &s;mart an&s;wer that Lord Wharton is &s;aid to have given, which as I ob&s;erved, Swift never forgave or forgot. It was to this purpo&s;e: "Oh my Lord! <HI>We</HI> mu&s;t not prefer or countenance the&s;e fellows; we have character enough <HI>our&s;elves.</HI>"</P>
<P>Dean Swift was likewi&s;e very angry with Dr Sharp, Lord Archbi&s;hop of York, who replied to Queen Anne, when &s;he was con&s;ulting the Doctor about making Swift a bi&s;hop, "I hope your Maje&s;ty will fir&s;t be &s;atisfied that Dean Swift is a Chri&s;tian." It is very certain that this &s;peech favoured of extreme a&s;perity, and it was never forgiven by Swift.</P>
<P>Repeated di&s;appointments increa&s;ed the natural acrimony of Swift's temper; this gave a &s;plenetic tinc|ture to his writings, and amid&s;t the duties of private and dome&s;tic life, it too frequently appeared to &s;hade the lu&s;tre of his more eminent virtues. A pre-&s;enti|ment
<PB N="115" REF="032623_0114_0FF3F29E77733890">
which he had long entertained of that wretch|edne&s;s which would inevitably overtake him towards the clo&s;e of life, by the failure of his intellects, crouded his mind with the mo&s;t melancholy ideas, and tinged every object around him. How far his gloomy &s;entiments prevailed, we learn from a very remarkable anecdote, pre&s;erved by Dr. Young, in his conjectures upon original compo&s;ition. Mr. Faulk|ner, in his letter to Lord Che&s;terfield, hath given one of a very &s;imilar nature, which we will tran|&s;cribe: "One time in a journey from Dorgheda to Navan, the Dean rode before the company, made a &s;udden &s;top, di&s;mounted his hor&s;e, fell on his knees, lifted up his hands and prayed in the mo&s;t devout manner. When his friends came up, he de&s;ired and in&s;i&s;ted on their alighting, which they did, and a&s;ked him the meaning; "gentlemen, &s;aid he, pray join your hearts in fervent prayers with mine that I may be never like this oak tree, which is decayed and withered at top, whil&s;t all the other parts are &s;ound."</P>
<P>The concluding &s;cene of his life was truly affect|ing, and afforded a &s;triking le&s;&s;on to check the pride of human genius, and great abilities. Mr. Faulkner gives the following account of it:</P>
<P>"Swift was never very outrageous, but his mem|ory failed him by degrees for &s;everal years together, in&s;omuch that he forgot all his friends and dome&s;|tics; he could not call any of them by their names, nor for clothes, food, nor any of the nece&s;&s;aries he wanted. In &s;hort, his forgetfulne&s;s grew &s;o much upon him, that he could not remember any one pa&s;|&s;age of his life, nor read, nor even tell his letters for near two years before his death. He likewi&s;e lo&s;t the u&s;e of his &s;peech, excepting now and then utter|ing &s;ome incoherent, rambling words, being incapa|ble of a&s;king any que&s;tions, or returning any an&s;wers; nor could he a&s;k for one nece&s;&s;ary of life. During this melancholy &s;ituation, great care was taken of his per&s;on and food, as he was incapable of dre&s;&s;ing,
<PB N="116" REF="032623_0115_0FF3F2A157F11AC8">
undre&s;&s;ing, or helping him&s;elf to clothes or victuals; and &s;o totally was he deprived of all rational facul|ties, that he was treated like a new-born infant, being taken out of bed, undre&s;&s;ed, and put into bed like the younge&s;t child; and had the actions of one, being fond of gold and &s;ilver toys, which he would play with, or put in his mouth. When he was dead, Mr. Whiteway, an eminent &s;urgeon, nearly related to him, opened his &s;kull, and found much water in the brain."</P>
<P>Thus ended this great man, who&s;e writings have made &s;o much noi&s;e in the world!</P>

<HEAD>The Prudent Wife&mdash;A True Story.</HEAD>
<P>IN the libidinous reign of king Charles II. there was a young lady named I&s;abella, who was one of the maids of honour to the duche&s;s of York, that drew the attention of the whole court upon her; &s;he was the reigning to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t of that galtant age, and equally admired by the men of plea&s;ure, and men of wit; with her beauty &s;he was &s;trictly mode&s;t; with her wit &s;he was prudent and good-natured. Among her numerous train of admirers, none &s;eemed &s;o agreeable and de&s;erving her e&s;teem, as the young Vi&s;count Belmour, who, incapable of any ba&s;e de|&s;igns, even when &s;uch de&s;igns were thought rather an honour than a reflection, gave &s;uch a&s;&s;urances of his love, that I&s;abella ea&s;ily &s;urrendered her heart. I&s;abella's aunt, who was her guardian, readily con|&s;ented to the match, and the nuptials were celebra|ted with mutual joy. As this was a marriage not made up by treaty, but free choice and inclination, they did not fall into that modi&s;h coldne&s;s and com|plai&s;ant indifference people of fa&s;hion are &s;oon apt to do. The Vi&s;count was a man of unu&s;ual &s;weet|ne&s;s and affability of temper, which, when joined to that of I&s;abella's, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily make him hap|py with his wife; yet this happine&s;s of temper drew him into &s;ome misfortunes; his ea&s;ine&s;s and credu|lity of the genero&s;ity and openne&s;s of &s;ome com|panions, had like to have le&s;&s;ened his dome&s;tic felici|ty, had not I&s;abella's di&s;cretion prevented it. My lord had contracted a mo&s;t intimate acquaintance with one Mr. Horneck, a man of a plea&s;ant conver|&s;ation, had a pretty knack of telling a &s;tory, &s;ung agreeably, was an arch mimic; and, in &s;hort, an humourous companion. Such was his public cha|racter; but this was only a ma&s;k to conceal the tricking game&s;ter, and the de&s;igning pander. To render him&s;elf more powerful with men of quality, he made him&s;elf in&s;trumental to their follies or their
<PB N="119" REF="032623_0118_0FF3F2A7421AF4A8">
vices, and was never without &s;ome new face to en|gage his acquaintance. Vi&s;count Belmour was not inclined to any of the&s;e vices that Horneck was pro|curer of; yet this wretch had cunning enough to draw him into all: with drinking, his health &s;oon began to impair; with lo&s;&s;es, his temper was often &s;oured; with wenching, that fondne&s;s and cordial love he was u&s;ed to &s;hew to his lady, began to cea&s;e. I&s;abella was not a little alarmed at this conduct; &s;he was too well informed of his vices, yet prudently thought, that any violent oppo&s;ition would but heighten the mi&s;chief; on the contrary, &s;he took care to make home as ea&s;y to him as po&s;&s;ible; &s;tudi|ous to oblige him, &s;he never di&s;gu&s;ted him with har&s;h reproaches, or &s;atirical reflections on his conduct; neither, though careful to plea&s;e him, did &s;he run into an extreme of fondne&s;s; &s;he was not fond when &s;he thought it would be di&s;agreeable; for &s;he knew that a wife without di&s;cretion may make the tender|e&s;t endearments the mo&s;t trouble&s;ome. I&s;abella was gay or fond, as &s;he &s;ound my lord in the temper to receive either; and without letting him know &s;he had information of his gaming abroad, would pro|po&s;e cards or hazard at home, with &s;uch company as &s;he thought would plea&s;e him; and never forgot to include Mr. Horneck among them.</P>
<P>Sometimes her propo&s;al was accepted, and by that means found out the &s;harper, the pander, the flatterer, and the villain, in Mr. H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rneck.</P>
<P>Luckily for this di&s;creet lady it happened, that, at the &s;ame time, Florella, a beautiful lady, who had married my lord's brother, was extremely unea|&s;y by her jealou&s;y; for, being certainly informed of her hu&s;band's keeping a woman of the town, and, at the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me time being ruined by &s;harpers at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ming, Florella came one day to my lord to complain of his brother's conduct, and fal&s;hood to her bed: &s;he cri|ed, &s;he raved, &s;he threatned to live not a moment longer with him. My lord did what he could to
<PB N="120" REF="032623_0119_0FF3F2A9812E46D0">
pacify her, but all in vain; my lady &s;ucceeded bet|ter, who taking this opportunity to &s;hew my lord his own foibles, thus addre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to her &s;i&s;ter: "I fancy, dear &s;i&s;ter, &s;aid &s;he, you want only a little prudential good humour to reclaim your hu&s;band; beauty and wit will not avail without di&s;cretion. There is a pa&s;&s;ive kind of virtue nece&s;&s;ary to &s;hew him his follies; it mu&s;t not be done with ill nature and con&s;tant reproaches on his conduct, which, I am afraid, is your method. If my lord Belmour were guilty of the &s;ame follies, (which I dare affirm he never will) I &s;hould my&s;elf act as I advi&s;e you. You have beauty enough to plea&s;e a hu&s;band; have therefore an equal de&s;ire to do it; be the more &s;tu|dious of his humour, as he is the more faulty in his conduct; and let your affability &s;hew his inju&s;tice in wronging you: nor can you think this policy fal&s;e, when the mi&s;tre&s;&s;es men vi&s;it, exert all their little arts to plea&s;e them, and render their company agreeable; and this for gain only, without honour, without con&s;cienc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and without love. Why then &s;hould not a virtuous woman &s;hew as great a de&s;ire to plea&s;e her hu&s;band, as the artful jilts do to plea&s;e their gallants? In &s;hort, make home entirely ea&s;y to him, and by endeavouring to fix his felicity, you will fix your own."</P>
<P>Florella was plea&s;ed with her advice; my lord ap|proved it, and was &s;ecretly touched to the &s;oul, for his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions again&s;t &s;o incomparable a wife, who had acted what &s;he &s;poke, and had more per|&s;onal charms than the woman his fal&s;e friend had introduced him to. When he had recollected him|&s;elf, he propo&s;ed that his &s;i&s;ter &s;hould bring her hu&s;band to dinner ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t day, and that his lady &s;hould repeat what &s;he had already &s;aid, and he was a&s;&s;ured it would have an excellent effect. It was agreed, but with this prudent condition of lady I&s;abella, that her di&s;cour&s;e &s;hould be directed to my lord, to
<PB N="121" REF="032623_0120_0FF3F2AB0BE5DA48">
take off any &s;u&s;picion, that her di&s;cour&s;e was direct|ed to his brother. The next day they met, and my lord &s;aw him&s;elf di&s;creetly attacked by his lady for his real faults, while &s;he &s;eemed to take them for imaginary. To what &s;he had &s;aid before, &s;he added &s;ome reflections on the ill choice men of quality make of their acquaintance; among whom are laughing buffoons, who lead them into all the vices of the age, under the fal&s;e pretence of friend&s;hip; at which words looking at my lord in the mo&s;t ten|der manner, &s;he concluded, "The&s;e, my lord, are wretched friends, who lead you into &s;uch evils; on the contrary, the friend&s;hip between man and wife is cemented by virtue, love, and intere&s;t; and can|not be di&s;&s;olved without de&s;troying the happine&s;s of both. Let not then any fal&s;e friend deceive you to your ruin; I de&s;ire a continuance of your love only &s;o long as I endeavour to de&s;erve it."&mdash;At the&s;e words, my lord, overcome with the &s;oft reproach, flung him&s;elf about her neck, and, amid&s;t a thou|&s;and ki&s;&s;es, promi&s;ed mutual love and mutual hap|pine&s;s. The&s;e tran&s;ports were followed by the bro|ther and his wife, who owned him&s;elf a convert to virtue and matrimonial love. Thus, what neither beauty nor wit could effect, prudence did; their lives afterwards were pro&s;perous, and their deaths happy.</P>

<P>As &s;oon as the chattering of the birds, the bark|ing of the dogs, and the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">wing of the cats, which my entrance occa&s;ioned, began to cea&s;e, "You find me, Sir, (&s;aid the lady) tending my little family, the only joy of my life; here is a dear pretty creature! (holding up the little dog while combing) a beauty, Sir, a fine long eared &s;nub no&s;ed beauty! Lady Faddle adverti&s;ed three quarters of a year, and could not get the fellow to it. Ah, ble&s;s it and love it, &s;weet &s;oul!" And then &s;he &s;troked it, and ki&s;&s;ed it for near two minutes, uttering the whole time all tho&s;e inarticulate &s;ounds, which cannot be commit|ted to paper, and which are only addre&s;&s;ed to dogs, cats, and children, and may very properly be &s;tiled the language of the nur&s;ery.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="032623_0127_0FF3F2B9A1A84988">The lady ob&s;erved me &s;mile at the embraces &s;he be&s;towed on her motley darling, and &s;aid, "I am afraid, Sir, you do not love the&s;e pretty creatures. How can you be &s;o cruel? Poor dumb things! I would not have them hurt for all the world; nor do I &s;ee why a lady &s;hould not indulge her&s;elf in having &s;uch &s;weet little company about her, as well as you men run out e&s;tates in keeping a pack of filthy hounds." She then laid Pompey on his velvet cu&s;hion by the fire &s;ide, and railed at the barbarity of the human &s;pecies to the re&s;t of the creation, and entered into a long di&s;&s;ertation on tenderne&s;s and humanity.</P>
<P>An humane di&s;po&s;ition is indeed &s;o amiable either in man or woman, that it ought always to be cher|i&s;hed and kept alive in our bo&s;oms; but at the &s;ame time we &s;hould be cautious not to render the fir&s;t virtue of our nature ridiculous. The mo&s;t com|pa&s;&s;ionate temper may be &s;ufficiently gratified by relieving the wretched of our own &s;pecies; but who would even boa&s;t of their genero&s;ity to a lap-dog, and their conferring eternal obligations on a mon|key? Or would any per&s;on de&s;erve to be celebrated for their charity, who &s;hould deny &s;upport to a rela|tion or a friend, becau&s;e he maintains a litter of kittens? For my own part, before I would treat a Dutch puppy with &s;uch ab&s;urd fondne&s;s, I mu&s;t be brought to wor&s;hip dogs as the Egyptians did of old; and before I would &s;o extravagantly doat upon a monkey, I would change my humanity with a baboon.</P>
<P>My female friend is not the only in&s;tance of this fondne&s;s for the brute creation being carried to &s;uch ridiculous lengths. Many grave Doctors of the faculty have been called in to feel the pul&s;e of a lap-dog, and in&s;pect the u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ine of a &s;quirrel, and one lady of my acquaintance, carried the ab&s;urdity &s;o far, as to di&s;charge her chaplain becau&s;e he refu&s;ed to bury her monkey; another friend of mine, but

<P>But of all follies, &s;urely it is the greate&s;t to pro|vide for the&s;e animals by will, which ab&s;urd legacies de&s;erve as little the title of humanity, as tho&s;e donors merit the epithet of charitable, who in a death-bed fright &s;tarve their relations by leaving their e&s;tates to found an ho&s;pital. It is very much to be wi&s;hed, that money left in tru&s;t for &s;uch u&s;es, were &s;ubject to &s;ome &s;tatutes of mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ain; or at lea&s;t, that the gentlemen of the long robe would centrive &s;ome &s;cheme to cut off the entail from monkeys, mack|aws, Italian grey hounds, and tabby cats.</P>
<P>It is not &s;o &s;urpri&s;ing that a &s;tage coachman &s;hould love his hor&s;es better than his wife or children; or a country E&s;quire be fond of his hounds and hunt|ers, becau&s;e the rea&s;on of this regard for them is ea&s;ily accounted for; upon the &s;ame principles, a &s;ea captain has been known to contract an affection for his &s;hip; but no coachman would like Caligula, tie his hor&s;es to a golden rack, but thinks he &s;hews &s;uf|ficient kindne&s;s by filling them with good whole&s;ome provender; and the country &s;port&s;man takes care to provide his hounds with a good kennel and hor&s;e-fle&s;h, but would never dream of placing them on cu&s;hions before the fire, feeding them with frica&s;&s;ees, or breeding them with as much care as the heir to his e&s;tate,</P>
<P>Among the fair &s;ex this irregular pa&s;&s;ion is mo&s;t frequently to be found. How often has the &s;lighted gallant envied the care&s;&s;es given to a lap-dog, or ki&s;&s;es be&s;towed on a &s;quirrel! and "I would I were thy bird!" has been the fond exclamation of many a Romeo. But this affection for birds and bea&s;ts generally wears off after marriage, and the
<PB N="130" REF="032623_0129_0FF3F2BCB56910B0">
ladies commonly di&s;card their four-footed darlings, and feathered favourites, when they can be&s;tow their endearments on an hu&s;band. On this account, the&s;e dry nur&s;es to pugs and grimalkins, are gener|ally to be met with among tho&s;e females, who have been di&s;appointed in the affairs of love, and have, again&s;t their will, retained the flower of their vir|ginity till it has withered in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. It &s;ome|times happens that there is a kind of analogy be|tween the gallant they once loved, and the animal on which they afterwards fix their affections; and I very well remember an in&s;tance of a lady's pa&s;&s;ion for a lawyer being converted into dotage on a parrot, and have an old maiden aunt, who once langui&s;hed for a beau, who&s;e heart is now devoted to a monkey.</P>
<P>After what has been &s;aid, it will not appear &s;trange, that a lady &s;hould be very &s;olicitous to pre|&s;erve the breed of her favourite animals; a gentle|man in St. James's &s;treet, lately &s;ent his little Cupid in a &s;edan chair as far as Gro&s;venor-&s;quare, to wait upon a lady's Venus for this purpo&s;e; and I &s;hall always remember a card which was &s;ent to another lady on a like occa&s;ion, expre&s;&s;ed in the following terms:</P>

<P>Plato in the vi&s;ion of Erus the Armenian, records &s;ome beautiful tran&s;migrations; as that the &s;oul of Orpheus, who was mu&s;ical, melancholy, and a wo|man-hater, entered into a &s;wan; the &s;oul of Ajax, which was all wrath and fiercene&s;s, into a lion; the &s;oul of Agamemnon, that was rapacious and impe|rious into an eagle; and the &s;oul of Ther&s;ites, who was a mimic and a buffoon, into a monkey.</P>

<P>As we are upon this &s;ubject, we will annex the following account from the Spectator, &s;uppo&s;ed to be written by a monkey to a lady who kept him:</P>
<P>"Madam&mdash;Not having the gift of &s;pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch, I have
<PB N="132" REF="032623_0131_0FF3F2C1DE1EA1E0">
a long time waited in vain for an opportunity of making my&s;elf known to you; and having at pre&s;|ent the conveniences of pen, ink, and paper by me, I gladly take the occa&s;ion of giving you my hi&s;tory in writing, which I could not do by word of mouth.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t know, Madam, that about a thou&s;and years ago, I was an Indian Brachman, and ver&s;ed in all tho&s;e my&s;terious &s;ecrets which your European philo&s;opher called Pythagoras, is &s;aid to have learn|ed from our fraternity. I had &s;o ingratiated my&s;elf by my great &s;kill in the occult &s;ciences with a daemon whom I u&s;ed to conver&s;e with, that he promi&s;ed to grant me whatever I &s;hould a&s;k him. I de&s;ired that my &s;oul might never pa&s;s into the body of a brute creature; but this he told me was not in his power to grant me. I then begged that into whatever creature I &s;hould chance to tran&s;migrate, I might &s;till retain my memory, and be con&s;cious that I was the &s;ame per&s;on who lived in different animals. This he told me was within his power, and accordingly promi&s;ed on the word of a daemon, that he would grant me what I de&s;ired. From that time forth I lived &s;o very unblameably, that I was made pre&s;ident of a college of Brachmans, an office which I di&s;charged with great integrity till the day of my death.</P>
<P>I was then &s;huffled into another human body, and acted my part &s;o well in it, that I became fir&s;t mini&s;ter to a prince who reigned on the banks of the Ganges. I here lived in great honour for &s;everal years, but by degrees lo&s;t all the innocence of the Brachman, being obliged to rifle and oppre&s;s the people to enrich my &s;overeign; till at length I be|came &s;o odious, that my ma&s;ter, to recover his cred|it with his &s;ubjects, &s;hot me through the heart with an arrow, as I was one day addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to him at the head of his army.</P>
<P>Upon my next remove I found my&s;elf in the woods,
<PB N="133" REF="032623_0132_0FF3F2C369725618">
under the &s;hape of a jackall, and &s;oon li&s;ted my&s;elf in the &s;ervice of a lion. I u&s;ed to yelp near his den about midnight, which was his time of rou&s;ing and &s;eeking after his prey. He always followed me in the rear, and when I had run down a fat buck, a wild goat, or an hare, after he had fea&s;ted very plen|tifully upon it him&s;elf, would now and then throw me a bone that was but half picked for my encour|agement; but upon my being un&s;ucce&s;sful in two or three chaces, he gave me &s;uch a confounded gripe in his anger, that I died of it.</P>
<P>In my next tran&s;migration I was again &s;et upon two legs, and became an Indian tax-gatherer; but having been guilty of great extravagances, and be|ing married to an expen&s;ive jade of a wife, I ran &s;o cur&s;edly in debt, that I dur&s;t not &s;hew my head. I could no &s;ooner &s;tep out of my hou&s;e, but I was arre&s;ted by &s;ome per&s;on or other that lay in wait for me. As I ventured abroad one night in the du&s;k of the evening, I was taken up and hurried into a dun|geon, where I died a few months after.</P>
<P>My &s;oul then entered into a flying fi&s;h, and in that &s;tate led a mo&s;t melancholy life for the &s;pace of &s;ix years. Several fi&s;hes of prey pur&s;ued me when I was in the water, and if I betook my&s;elf to my wings, it was ten to one I had a flock of birds aiming at me. As I was one day flying amid&s;t a fleet of En|gli&s;h &s;hips, I ob&s;erved an huge &s;ea gull whetting his bill, and hovering ju&s;t over my head; upon my dip|ping into the water to avoid him, I fell into the mouth of a mon&s;trous &s;hark that &s;wallowed me down in an in&s;tant.</P>
<P>I was &s;ome years afterwards, to my great &s;urpri&s;e, an eminent banker in Lombard-&s;treet; and remem|bering how I had formerly &s;uffered for want of mon|ey, became &s;o very &s;ordid and avaricious, that the whole town cried &s;hame of me. I was a mi&s;erable little old fellow to look upon, for I had in a manner &s;tarved my&s;elf, and was nothing but &s;kin and bone when I died.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="032623_0133_0FF3F2C59797DB20">I was afterwards very much troubled and amazed to find my&s;elf dwindled into an emmet. I was heart|ily concerned to make &s;o in&s;ignificant a figure, and did not know but &s;ome time or other I might be reduced to a mite if I did not mend my manners. I therefore applied my&s;elf with great diligence to the offices that were allotted me, and was generally looked upon as the notable&s;t ant in the whole mole|hill. I was at la&s;t picked up as I was groaning un|der a burden, by an unlucky cock-&s;parrow that lived in the neighbourhood, and had before made dep|radations upon our commonwealth.</P>
<P>I then bettered my condition a little, and lived an whole &s;ummer in the &s;hape of a bee; but being tired with the painful and penurious life I had un|dergone in my two la&s;t tran&s;migrations, I fell into the other extreme, and turned drone. As I one day headed a party to plunder an hive, we were received &s;o warmly by the &s;w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rm which defended it, that we were mo&s;t of us left dead upon the &s;pot.</P>
<P>I might tell you of many other tran&s;migrations which I went through; how I was a town rake, and afterwards did penance in a bay gelding for ten years; as al&s;o how I was a taylor, a &s;hrimp, and a tom tit. In the la&s;t of the&s;e my &s;hapes I was &s;hot in the Chri&s;tmas holidays by a young jackanapes, who would needs try his new gun upon me.</P>
<P>But I &s;hall pa&s;s over the&s;e and &s;everal other &s;tages of life, to remind you of the young bean who made love to you about &s;ix months &s;ince. You may re|member, Madam, how he ma&s;ked, and danced, and &s;ung, and played a thou&s;and tricks to gain you; and how he was at la&s;t carried off by a cold that he got under your window one night in a &s;erenade; I was that unfortunate young fellow, whom you were then &s;o cruel to. Not long after my &s;hifting that unluc|ky body, I found my&s;elf on a hill in Ethiopia, where I lived in my pre&s;ent grote&s;que &s;hape, till I was caught by a &s;ervant of the Engli&s;h factory, and &s;ent over

into Great Britain; I need not inform you how I came into your hands; you &s;ee, Madam, that this is not the fir&s;t time that you have had me in a chain; I am however very happy in this my captivity, as you often be&s;tow on me tho&s;e ki&s;&s;es and care&s;&s;es which I would have given the world for when I was a man.

<HEAD>The Genero&s;ity of a Lord Chancellor.</HEAD>
<P>A Living of five hundred pounds per annum falling into the gift of a late Lord Chancel|lor, the Premier recommended one of his friends as de&s;erving it, whom his lord&s;hip approved. In the interim, the curate, who had &s;erved the late incum|bent many years, for thirty pounds per annum, came up with a petition &s;igned by many of the inhabi|tants, te&s;tifying his good behaviour, and &s;etting forth that he had a wife and &s;even children to maintain, and begging his lord&s;hip would &s;tand his friend, that he might be continued in the curacy; and in con&s;ideration of his large family, if he could prevail with the next incumbent to add ten pounds a year he &s;hould for ever pray for him. His lord&s;hip pro|mi&s;ed to u&s;e his utmo&s;t endeavours to &s;erve him. The reverend gentleman for whom the living was de&s;igned, &s;oon after going to pay his re&s;pects to his lord&s;hip, my lord told him the affair of the curate, with this difference only, that he &s;hould allow him &s;ixty pounds a year in&s;tead of thirty. The par&s;on in &s;ome confu&s;ion replied, that he was very &s;orry he could not grant his lord&s;hip's reque&s;t, &s;or that he had promi&s;ed the curacy to another, and could not go back from his word. How! &s;aid his lord&s;hip,
<PB N="136" REF="032623_0135_0FF3F2CA076E5BE8">
have you promi&s;ed the curacy before you were po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of the living? Well, to keep your word with your friend, I will give him the curacy, but the liv|ing I a&s;&s;ure you I will give to another; and having &s;o &s;aid, left him. The next day the poor curate coming to know his de&s;tiny, his lord&s;hip told him, that he had u&s;ed his endeavours to &s;erve him as to the curacy, but with no &s;ucce&s;s, the reverend gen|tleman having di&s;po&s;ed of it before. The curate, with a deep &s;igh, thanked his lord&s;hip for his good|ne&s;s, and was going to withdraw; when my lord calling him back, &s;aid with a &s;mile, "Well, my friend, it is true I have it not in my power to give you the curacy, but if you will accept the living it is at your &s;ervice." It is not in the power of words to de&s;cribe the curate's &s;urprize and joy at this &s;ud|den turn in his favour, who, with the mo&s;t moving expre&s;&s;ions of gratitude, returned his lord&s;hip thanks, who&s;e goodne&s;s had in a moment rai&s;ed him and his family from the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;itous condition to ea&s;e and affluence: and my lord to complete his gen|ero&s;ity, ordered his clerks to make out the diploma, without taking their cu&s;tomary fees.</P>

<HEAD>Anecdote of the late Earl of Ro&s;s.</HEAD>
<P>THE late Earl of Ro&s;s, was in character and di&s;|po&s;ition, like the humourous Earl of Roche&s;ter. He had an infinite fund of wit, great &s;pirits; was fond of all the vices which the <HI>beau monde</HI> call plea|&s;ures, and by that means fir&s;t impaired his fortune as much as he po&s;&s;ibly could; and finally, his health beyond repair.</P>
<P>The poor Earl having led this life till it brought him to death's door, the Reverend Dean Madden, a man of exemplary piety and virtue, having heard his lord&s;hip was given over, thought it his duty to
<PB N="137" REF="032623_0136_0FF3F2CB92C69C30">
write him a very pathetic letter, to remind him of his pa&s;t life; the particulars of which he mentioned, &s;uch as whoring, gaming, drinking, rioting, bla&s;|pheming his Maker, and, in &s;hort, all manner of wickedne&s;s, exhorting him in the tendere&s;t manner, to employ the few moments that yet remained to him, in penitently confe&s;&s;ing his manifold tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions, and &s;oliciting his pardon from an offended Deity, before whom he was &s;hortly to appear.</P>
<P>It is proper to acquaint the reader, that the late Earl of Kildair was one of the mo&s;t pious noblemen of the age, and, in every re&s;pect, a contra&s;t in cha|racter to Lord Ro&s;s. When the latter, who retained his &s;en&s;es to the la&s;t moment, and died rather for want of breath, than want of &s;pirits, read over the Dean's letter (which came to him under cover) he ordered it to be put in another paper, &s;ealed up, and directed to the Earl of Kildair; he likewi&s;e pre|vailed on the Dean's &s;ervant to carry it, and to &s;ay it came from his ma&s;ter, which he was encouraged to do by a couple of guineas, and his knowing no|thing of the contents. Lord Kildair was an effem|inate, puny, little man, extremely formal and deli|cate, in&s;omuch that, when he was married to lady Mary O'Brien, one of the mo&s;t &s;hining beauties then in the world, he would not take his wedding gloves off when he went to bed. From this &s;ingle in&s;tance, it may be judged with what &s;urpri&s;e and indignation he read over the Dean's letter, containing &s;o many accu&s;ations for crimes he knew him&s;elf entirely in|nocent of. He fir&s;t ran to his lady, and informed her that Dean Madden was actually mad; to prove which, he delivered her the epi&s;tle he had ju&s;t re|ceived. Her lady&s;hip was as much confounded and amazed at it, as he could po&s;&s;ibly be, but withal ob|&s;erved, that the letter was not written in the &s;tile of a madman, and advi&s;ed him to go to the archbi&s;hop of Dublin about it; accordingly his lord&s;hip order|ed his coach, and went to the epi&s;copal palace,
<PB N="138" REF="032623_0137_0FF3F2CDE43CB008">
where he found his grace at home, and immediately acco&s;ted him in this manner: "Pray, my lord, did you ever hear that I was a bla&s;phemer, a whoremon|ger, a rioter, and every thing that is ba&s;e and infa|mous?" "You, my lord, &s;aid the bi&s;hop, every one knows you are the pattern of humility, godline&s;s, and virtue." "Well, my lord, what &s;atisfaction can I have of a reverend Divine, who, under his own hand, lays all this to my charge?" "Surely, (an&s;|wered his grace) no man in his &s;en&s;es, that knows your lord&s;hip, would pre&s;ume to do it. And if any clergyman has been guilty of &s;uch an offence, your lord&s;hip will have &s;atisfaction from the &s;piritual court." Upon this lord Kildair delivered to his grace the letter, which he told him was delivered by the Dean's &s;ervant, and which both the archbi&s;hop and the Earl knew to be the Dean's own hand-wri|ting. The archbi&s;hop immediately &s;ent for the Dean, who, happening to be at home, in&s;tantly obeyed the &s;ummons; before he entered the room, he advi&s;ed lord Kildair to walk into another apart|ment, which his lord&s;hip accordingly did. When the Dean entered, his grace looked very &s;ternly, and demanded if he had written that letter; the Dean an&s;wered, "I did, my lord." "Mr. Dean, (returned the prelate) I always thought you a man of &s;en&s;e and prudence, but this unguarded action mu&s;t le&s;&s;en you in the e&s;teem of all good men. To throw out &s;o many cau&s;ele&s;s invectives again&s;t the mo&s;t unblem|i&s;hed nobleman in Europe, and accu&s;e him of crimes to which he and his family have ever been &s;trangers, mu&s;t certainly be the effect of a di&s;tempered brain; be&s;ides, Sir, you have by this means laid your&s;elf open to a pro&s;ecution, which will oblige you either publicly to retract what you have &s;aid, or to &s;uffer the con&s;equence." "My lord, an&s;wered the Dean, I never think, act, or write any thing for which I am afraid to be called to an account before any tribunal upon earth; and, if I am to be pro&s;ecuted for di&s;|charging
<PB N="139" REF="032623_0138_0FF3F2D0285CE2C0">
the duties of my function, I will &s;uffer pa|tiently the &s;evere&s;t penalties in ju&s;tification of it." And &s;o &s;aying, the Dean retired with &s;ome emotion, and left the two noblemen as much in the dark as ever. Lord Kildair went home, and &s;ent for a proctor, to whom he communicated the Dean's letter, and ordered a citation to be &s;ent him as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; in the mean time, the archbi&s;hop, who knew the Dean had a family to provide for, and fore&s;aw that ruin mu&s;t attend his entering into a &s;uit with &s;o powerful a per&s;on, went to his hou&s;e, and recommended to him, to a&s;k my lord's pardon before the matter became public; "a&s;k his pardon! &s;aid the Dean, why, the man's dead." "Lord Kildair dead!" "No, lord Ro&s;s." "Good God! &s;aid the archbi&s;hop, did you not &s;end a letter ye&s;terday to lord Kildair?" "No, truly my lord, but I &s;ent one to the unhappy Earl of Ro&s;s, who was then given over, and I thought it my duty to write to him in the manner I did." Upon examining the &s;ervant, the whole was rectified, and the Dean &s;aw with great regret, that lord Ro&s;s died as he had lived; nor did he continue in this life above four hours, after he &s;ent off the letter. The footman lo&s;t his place by the je&s;t, and was, indeed, the only &s;ufferer for my lord's la&s;t piece of humour.</P>

<P>"Our ca&s;e is very hard, for is it not enough that we, who are arrant fle&s;h and blood, are obliged to di&s;&s;emble our pa&s;&s;ions, &s;eem what we are not, and &s;peak what we do not think; that we mu&s;t appear all ice, when at lea&s;t we may have &s;ome flame; and when the man of our heart a&s;ks our love, we mu&s;t turn a&s;ide, blu&s;h, bridle, look &s;illy, and cry No; &mdash; le&s;t by a too ready compliance we &s;hould &s;eem to break a ridiculous cu&s;tom, or &s;poil the &s;park's &s;queami&s;h appetite.

real nature, truth, and rea&s;on; and not as you have been plea&s;ed to paint them.</P>
<P>"This determination is not made by my&s;elf alone; the in&s;ults and ill u&s;age of your &s;ex, have, for &s;ome time, formed numerous parti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s of old maids, who, at fir&s;t, only pre&s;umed tenderly to complain of their hard&s;hips, and barely vindicate them&s;elves from your unju&s;t cen&s;ures; but as now our numbers are in|crea&s;ed, many parties which were u&s;ed to meet in different a&s;&s;emblies, have now united them&s;elves in a regular manner, and are become a very formidable &s;ociety, under the title of <HI>The Convocation of Old Maids&punc; or Female Parliament.</HI></P>
<P>"Though after the manner of the clerical parlia|ment, we might have divided our&s;elves into two hou&s;es, yet we cho&s;e one a&s;&s;embly only, for fear of the di&s;tinction of being a member of the upper and the lower hou&s;e, might create jealou&s;ies and animo&s;i|ties about precedency, and render our whole political &s;cheme abortive. Be&s;ides, in reality, we are only the repre&s;entatives of the inferior order of old maids; for our preliminary articles were, that none could be admitted, as yet, who&s;e fortunes exceeded 1000l. down, all above that being mo&s;t concerned in inter|e&s;t; that none under thirty-five be admitted to have a vote, nor under thirty to have any office or place within or without doors, as attendants on this hon|orable hou&s;e. The&s;e preliminaries being fixed by the commi&s;&s;ioners appointed, our general meeting was held, and what were our &s;everal proceedings and re&s;olutions is my duty to tran&s;mit to you; and your duty, by the nature of your office, to publi&s;h to the world.</P>
<P>"You may imagine, that our fir&s;t meeting was much confu&s;ed, as there were no antient &s;tanding orders to regulate our&s;elves by; all were full of com|plaints, &s;ome were merry, &s;ome &s;ad, &s;ome rallied, &s;ome bewailed, more inveighed again&s;t the pre&s;ent &s;tate of affairs; but all, <HI>nem. con.</HI> concluded it high

time to put an end to our misfortunes; many pretty &s;peeches were lo&s;t for want of being heard; many pretty faces disfigured for want of temper. I know not what would have been the con&s;equence, had not I exerted the whole &s;trength of my lungs, and, by the dint of vociferation, been heard above them all. Though I was heard, yet, for &s;ome time, it was but indi&s;tinctly, till a good lady &s;econded me with hear her, hear her.&mdash;Hear her, hear her, was the unan|imous voice of the whole a&s;&s;embly; then, after a little pau&s;e of &s;ilence, I moved that every one might take her &s;eat; but this motion had not its de&s;ired effect; a precedence for places, and a &s;eat at the up|per end of the room &s;eemed to be univer&s;ally aimed at. To prevent this inconvenience, a &s;age lady ob|&s;erved to them, that in this a&s;&s;embly re&s;pect and precedency were only due to &s;eniority. This &s;peech occa&s;ioned quite an oppo&s;ite difficulty; for now the whole &s;tream of the crowd ran to the lower end of the room to be thought younge&s;t; nay, a de&s;ire of youth &s;eemed by far a &s;tronger pa&s;&s;ion than that of honour; and we were reduced to a &s;ad dilemma. But, with an happy pre&s;ence of mind, and a patriot ambition, I my&s;elf, though but in my &s;eventy-third year, walked up to the de&s;erted place, and there, in a pathetic &s;peech, &s;et forth the mi&s;ery of private views when the public good was in que&s;tion; and de&s;ired they would all concur in a vote, that there &s;hould be no di&s;tinction, but all &s;it at a round table.

<P>"Whether the fear of having their ages divulged, or (what I rather hope) a public &s;pirit for the pub|lic good, affected them, they all immediately, with|out di&s;tinction, &s;eated them&s;elves; and, on the mo|tion of the lady who before &s;econded me, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oted <HI>nem. con.</HI> that Mi&s;s Patty Pos &s;hould take the

<HEAD>An U&s;eful E&s;&s;ay on Laughter.</HEAD>
<P>THE famous Mr. Hobbs, in his di&s;cour&s;e upon Human Nature, after making curious ob&s;er|vations upon laughter, concludes thus: "The pa&s;&s;ion of laughter is nothing el&s;e but &s;udden glory ari&s;ing from &s;ome &s;udden conception of &s;ome emi|nency in our&s;elves, by compari&s;on with the infirm|ity of others, or with our own formerly; for men laugh at the pa&s;t follies of them&s;elves, when they come &s;uddenly to remembrance, except they bring with them any pre&s;ent di&s;honour."</P>
<P>According to this Author therefore, when we hear a man laugh exce&s;&s;ively, in&s;tead of &s;aying he is very merry, we ought to tell him he is very proud. And indeed if we look into the bottom of the matter, we &s;hall meet with many ob&s;ervations to confirm us in his opinion. Every one laughs at &s;ome body that is in an inferior &s;tate of folly to him&s;elf. It was
<PB N="145" REF="032623_0144_0FF3F2DC4DACF230">
formerly the cu&s;tom for every great hou&s;e in Eng|land, to keep a tame fool dre&s;&s;ed in petticoats, that the heirs of the family might have an opportunity of joking upon him and diverting them&s;elves with his ab&s;urdities. For the &s;ame rea&s;on idiots are &s;till in reque&s;t in mo&s;t of the courts of Germany, where there is not a Prince of any great magnificence, who has not two or three dre&s;&s;ed, di&s;tingui&s;hed, undi&s;|puted fools in his retinue, whom the re&s;t of his cour|tiers are always breaking their je&s;ts upon.</P>
<P>The Dutch, who are more famous for their indu&s;|try and application, than for wit and humour, hang up in &s;everal of their &s;treets what they call the &s;ign of the gaper, that is the head of an idiot dre&s;&s;ed in a cap and bells, and gaping in a mo&s;t immoderate manner; this is a &s;tanding je&s;t in Am&s;terdam.</P>
<P>Thus every one diverts him&s;elf with &s;ome per&s;on or other that is below him in point of under&s;tand|ing, and triumphs in the &s;uperiority of his genius, while he has &s;uch objects of deri&s;ion before his eyes. Mr. Dennis has very well expre&s;&s;ed this in a couple of humourous lines, which are part of the tran&s;la|tion of a &s;atire in Mon&s;ieur Boileau.</P>
<Q><L>Thus one fool <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">olls his tongue out at another,</L>
<L>And &s;hakes his empty noddle at his brother.</L></Q>
<P>Mr. Hobbs' reflection gives us the rea&s;on why the in&s;ignificant people above mentioned, excite laugh|ter among men of a gro&s;s ta&s;te; but as the more under&s;tanding part of mankind do not find their ri&s;ibility affected by &s;uch ordinary objects, it may be worth our while to examine into the &s;everal provo|catives of laughter in men of &s;uperior &s;en&s;e and knowledge.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, there is a &s;et of merry drolls, whom the common people of all countries admire, and &s;eem to love &s;o well that they could eat them according to the old proverb; I mean tho&s;e circum|feraneous
<PB N="146" REF="032623_0145_0FF3F2DE7836DE80">
wits whom every nation calls by the name of that di&s;h of meat which it loves be&s;t In Holland they are termed Pickle Herrings; in France, Jean Pottages; in Italy, Maccaronies; and in Great Britain, Jack Puddings. The&s;e merry wags from what&s;oever food they receive their titles, that they may make their audiences laugh, always appear in a fool's coat, and commit &s;uch blunders and mi&s;takes in every &s;tep they take, and every word they utter, as tho&s;e who li&s;ten to them would be a&s;hamed of.</P>
<P>But this little triumph of the under&s;tanding under the di&s;gui&s;e of laughter, is no where more vi&s;ible than in that cu&s;tom which prevails every where among us on the fir&s;t day of April, when every body takes it into his head to make as many fools as he can. In proportion as there are more follies di&s;|covered, &s;o there is more laughter rai&s;ed on this than on any other day in the whole year.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee in proportion as one man is more refined than another, he chu&s;es his food out of a lower or higher cla&s;s of mankind, or to &s;peak in a more philo&s;ophical language, that &s;ecret elation and pride of heart which is generally called laughter, ari&s;es in him from comparing him&s;elf with an ob|ject below him, whether it &s;o happens that it be a natural or an artificial fool. When a man of wit makes us laugh, it is by betraying &s;ome oddne&s;s or infirmity in his own character, or in the repre&s;en|tation which he makes of others.</P>

<HEAD>A new and remarkable Hi&s;tory of <HI>Fayette</HI> and <HI>Gra&s;&s;e.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MANY people who have travelled, may remem|ber to have &s;een Fayette and Gra&s;&s;e at &s;chool, in the town of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;oir, in A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">verg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, which place is celebrated over the whole world for its college and
<PB N="147" REF="032623_0146_0FF3F2E00802FAC8">
its kettles. Fayette was the &s;on of a hor&s;e dealer of high renown, and Gra&s;&s;e derived his birth from an able hu&s;bandman, who with the help of four hor&s;es cultivated a neighbouring farm, and when he had paid the poll tax, the &s;ub&s;idy, the exci&s;e, the &s;alt tax, the poundage, the capitation, and the twenti|eth penny, we cannot &s;uppo&s;e he was overburdened with riches.</P>
<P>Fayette and Gra&s;&s;e were comely well looking lads for Auvergne&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and contracted a great intimacy and friend&s;hip for each other; they had their little &s;chemes and <HI>tete-a-tetes</HI> by them&s;elves, upon which they reflected with great plea&s;ure when they were together in other company.</P>
<P>The time of their &s;tay at &s;chool was nearly expi|red, when a taylor brought Fayette a &s;uit of figured velvet, and a rich wai&s;tcoat, made up in a very good ta&s;te, with a letter addre&s;&s;ed to Mon&s;. de la Fayette. Gra&s;&s;e admired the cloaths without envy, but Fay|ette a&s;&s;umed an air of &s;uperiority which very much grieved Gra&s;&s;e. From this time Fayette for&s;ook his learning, and employed his time almo&s;t wholly in the looking-gla&s;s, which, added to the contempt with which he treated his &s;uppo&s;ed inferiors, made him very di&s;agreeable.</P>
<P>A &s;hort time after this elevation of our gentleman, a valet de chambre came po&s;t with another letter, directed to M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n&s;ieur the Marquis de la Fayette, which contained an order from Mon&s;ieur his father, for his coming to Paris. This Fayette in&s;tantly obeyed, and as he got into the ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;e, took Gra&s;&s;e by the hand, and gave him a &s;mile of protection with as much of the con&s;equential air as could be expected; Gra&s;&s;e, touched with an humiliating &s;en&s;e of his own inferiority, melted into tears, and Fayette drove away in all the glory of his n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w dignity.</P>
<P>But as our readers will naturally inquire how Fayette came by this dignity, it is nece&s;&s;ary to in|form them, that the father had &s;uddenly acquired
<PB N="148" REF="032623_0147_0FF3F2E2DE8195E8">
an immen&s;e fortune; Mon&s;. Fayette was an hand|&s;ome man, and Madam was not without her charms. When &s;he was &s;till in her bloom, they were brought to Paris by a law &s;uit, which totally ruined them; but fortune who delights in the capricious exalta|tion and deba&s;ement of mankind, ju&s;t then threw them in the way of a Commi&s;&s;ary, who had con|tracted to furni&s;h the military ho&s;pitals during the war; the Commi&s;&s;ary was a man of great talents, and could boa&s;t of having killed more &s;oldiers in one year than gunpowder had killed in ten; the Commi&s;&s;ary's wife was &s;mitten with Fayette, and the Commi&s;&s;ary him&s;elf was &s;mitten with Fayette's wife. Fayette &s;oon came in for a &s;hare of the contract, and undertook other bu&s;ine&s;s on his own account.</P>
<P>When a man once gets into the middle of the &s;tream, the tide it&s;elf will carry him along; this is verified in the in&s;tance of Commi&s;&s;aries and Con|tractors, who get immen&s;e &s;ums very frequently with little or no trouble; &s;uch was the pro&s;perous fortune of Fayette, the father, who became immedi|ately Mon&s;. de la Fayette, and &s;oon after having bought a Marqui&s;ate, which at once ennobled him and his children, he &s;ent for the Marquis his &s;on from &s;chool, that he might place him among the <HI>beau monde</HI> at Paris.</P>
<P>Graf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, who &s;till remembered his old &s;chool fellow with a tender &s;en&s;ibility, wrote him a few lines to congratulate him; the new Marquis &s;ent him no an&s;wer, and Gra&s;&s;e was indi&s;po&s;ed on account of this neglect.</P>
<P>The father and the mother of Fayette procured a tutor for their &s;on, who was a man of genteel ap|pearance, but knew nothing, and con&s;equently could not teach him any thing. The father was de&s;irous the &s;on &s;hould learn latin, but the mother oppo&s;ed; after much debate it was agreed that the que&s;tion &s;hould be referred to an author, who was celebrated for many agreeable performances. He was there|fore
<PB N="149" REF="032623_0148_0FF3F2E4661E9738">
invited to dinner, and the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e began by &s;aying, "Sir, as you are a latin &s;cholar, and a man of the world"&mdash;"I a latin &s;cholar!" &s;aid the belle e&s;prit, "I do not know one word of the language, and &s;o much the better for me; the&s;e people certainly &s;peak their own language be&s;t, who&s;e attention is not divided between that and others. Con&s;ider only the ladies, how much more plea&s;ing is their wit than ours! their letters are written with infinitely more elegance, and this &s;upe|riority is certainly owing to their not having learned latin."</P>
<P>"Very well (&s;ays Madam) am I not then in the right? I would have my &s;on a man of wit, I would have him make a figure in the world, and you &s;ee plainly if he learns latin, he will be undone; are operas and plays, I would fain know, performed in latin? Do lawyers &s;peak latin at the bar? Or do young gentlemen make love in latin?"</P>
<P>Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;. de la Fayette being wholly unable to re&s;i&s;t this amazing force of argument, immediately pa&s;&s;ed &s;entence, and it was concluded that the young Mar|quis &s;hould not lo&s;e his time in getting acquainted with Cicero, Horace, Juvenal or Virgil.</P>
<P>"But then, &s;aid the father, what &s;hall he learn? for certainly it is nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould learn &s;omething. May he not be taught a little geogra|phy?" "Of what &s;ervice will that be?" &s;ays the tutor. When the Marquis &s;hall think proper to vi&s;it his e&s;tates, do you think the po&s;tillions will not know the road? Take my word for it, there is no danger of their lo&s;ing their way. A man of fa&s;h|ion can travel very well without a quadrant, and go with great conveniency from Paris to Auvergne, without knowing what latitude he is in."</P>
<P>"You are certainly right, fays the father, but I have heard &s;omething of a fine &s;cience which I think they call a&s;tronomy." It is a pity, &s;ays the tutor, you ever heard of it at all; what occa&s;ion is there
<PB N="150" REF="032623_0149_0FF3F2E696D90F60">
for people in this world to regulate their motions by the &s;tars? Is it fit that the young Marquis &s;hould be fatigued to death by the calculation of an eclip&s;e, when he may find the time exactly by con&s;ulting an almanack, which will al&s;o acquaint him with all the moveable fea&s;ts, the age of the moon, and of all the &s;overeign princes in Europe?"</P>
<P>Madam entirely agreed with the tutor in this par|ticular&punc; the young Marquis his &s;on was over joyed, and the father was in &s;u&s;pence&mdash;"What then, &s;aid he, mu&s;t my &s;on learn?"&mdash;"To be amiable," replied the friend they had con&s;ulted, "if he knows the art of plea&s;ing, he knows all that is worthy to be known, and this art he cannot fail of learning under his mother's eye, though neither &s;he nor you &s;hould give your&s;elves the lea&s;t trouble about it."</P>
<P>Madam was &s;o delighted with this compliment that &s;he embraced the plea&s;ing dunce who paid it. "Ah! Sir, &s;aid &s;he, it is ea&s;y to di&s;cover that you are wi&s;er than all the world be&s;ides; my &s;on will be wholly indebted to you for his education; but per|haps, after all, it would not be ami&s;s for him to learn a little of hi&s;tory." "Alas; Madam, replied the or|acle, what good can that do him? Certainly no hi&s;|tory is either u&s;eful or plea&s;ing but that of the day. All ancient hi&s;tories, as one of our belle e&s;prits has very ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, are nothing more than fables artfully put together; and as for modern hi&s;tories, they are a chaos which it is impo&s;&s;ible to reduce to order. Of what importance is it to your &s;on that Charlemagne in&s;tituted the twelve Peers of France? And that his &s;on had an impediment in his &s;peech?"</P>
<P>"There never was a more true ob&s;ervation, cried the tutor; the young mind is often buried under a load of u&s;ele&s;s learning, by which its native powers are fir&s;t re&s;trained, and then de&s;troyed; but of all that is ab&s;urd among what are called the &s;ciences, the mo&s;t ab&s;urd is geometry. The objects of geom|etry are &s;urfaces, lines, and points, which have no
<PB N="151" REF="032623_0150_0FF3F2E964968808">
exi&s;tence in nature; and an hundred curve lines are fancied between a circle and a &s;traight line that touches it, though in reality there is not room for a &s;traw. In &s;hort, geometry is no better than a dull joke."</P>
<P>The father and mother &s;carcely under&s;tood one word of this ingenious argument again&s;t geometry, which notwith&s;tanding made a great impre&s;&s;ion upon them, and they declared them&s;elves entirely of the tutor's mind.</P>
<P>"A great lord (continued he) like Mon&s;ieur the Marquis, ought not to puzzle his brains with vain &s;peculations. If he &s;hould ever have occa&s;ion for the mo&s;t &s;ublime part of this &s;cience to lay down a plan of his e&s;tates, he may have them &s;urveyed for his money; if he would trace his nobility back to the remote&s;t ages, he may without difficulty find a Benedictine monk that will do it; the &s;ame may be &s;aid of all the arts; a young lord of illu&s;trious birth, is neither a painter, a mu&s;ician, an architect, nor a &s;tatuary; but he makes all tho&s;e arts flouri&s;h by his munificence; and it is certainly better to patroni&s;e than practi&s;e them. It is enough for the Marquis to have ta&s;te; it is the duty of arti&s;ts to exert their &s;kill for his plea&s;ure and advantage, and it is there|fore well &s;aid, that per&s;ons of quality, I mean tho&s;e who are very rich, know all things without learning any; their ta&s;te enables them to judge of every thing which they command and for which they pay."</P>
<P>The ma&s;ter of the art of plea&s;ing then interpo&s;ed: "You have ob&s;erved, Madam, &s;aid he, that the great purpo&s;e of life is to &s;ucceed in the world, but will any man pretend that this purpo&s;e can be an&s;|were<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> by the &s;ciences?

"Certainly not, replied the Marchione&s;s, (who&s;e

charms had given her &s;ome introduction to the <HI>beau monde</HI>) and it is by no means proper, that the Mar|quis, my &s;on, &s;hould cramp his genius by the &s;tudy of all this trumpery; but at la&s;t what &s;hall we teach him, for certainly as his father has ob&s;erved, a young gentleman ought to be qualified to &s;hine upon oc|ca&s;ion. I remember to have heard an Abbe &s;ay, that there was one &s;cience extremely agreeable and genteel; I cannot recollect the name of it, but it begins with a B." "With a B. Madam, &s;aid the genius, it could not be botany;" "No, (replied Madam) it was not botany, yet it ended &s;omething like that too." "O, I know what it was, &s;aid he, it was blazonry; but I a&s;&s;ure you it is by no means the mode at pre&s;ent; it has been wholly laid a&s;ide ever &s;ince painting coats of arms upon coaches went out of fa&s;hion; it was, to be &s;ure, at that time the mo&s;t u&s;eful knowledge in the world, but the ca&s;e is altered now; be&s;ides, at pre&s;ent the &s;tudy of heraldry would be infinite, for there is not a bar|ber who has not his coat of arms, and when a thing becomes common, you know people of fa&s;hion &s;hould di&s;regard it." Upon the whole, this &s;ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cious and illu&s;trious &s;ociety, having fairly di&s;cu&s;&s;ed the &s;ciences, it was at la&s;t determined that Mon&s;ieur the Marquis de la Fayette &s;hould learn to dance.</P>
<P>Nature, however, who indeed does every thing, had given this flower of nobility a talent which very &s;oon di&s;played it&s;elf with a&s;toni&s;hing &s;ucce&s;s. This happy talent was that of &s;inging a good &s;ong; the graces of youth, joined to this &s;uperior endowment, drew every one's eyes upon him as a young gentle|man of great expectation; he was a very great fa|vourite among the ladies, and having his head full of &s;ongs, he could ea&s;ily form new out of the old by a different combination of the phra&s;es and figures that he was continually repeating; but as his ver&s;es had a foot too little or too much, he got them cor|rected at the rate of twenty louis d'ors a &s;ong, and he at la&s;t got into the annals of literature, and was
<PB N="153" REF="032623_0152_0FF3F2EC77472368">
cla&s;&s;ed with the La Fairs, the Chaulieus, the Hamil|tons, the Sarazines, and the Voltures of the time.</P>
<P>The Marchione&s;s then con&s;idered her&s;elf as the mother of wit, and gave &s;uppers to the wits of the town; the young man's head was turned; he acqui|red the art of &s;peaking without knowing what he would &s;ay, and became perfect by habit in being &s;it for nothing.</P>
<P>When his father &s;ound him thus amazingly elo|quent, he very much regretted that he had not taught him latin, as he then might have bought him a con&s;iderable place in the law. His mother, who looked &s;till higher, undertook to get him a regiment, and in the mean time the young gentleman thought proper to make love.</P>
<P>As love is rather an expen&s;ive article, &s;o it co&s;t our hero more than a regiment; his expences were very great, and his parents ran out their fortunes very fa&s;t by living like people of the fir&s;t quality.</P>
<P>But as the &s;tate of their finances was known only to them&s;elves, a young widow of great rank, but of middling circum&s;tances, in the neighbourhood, &s;up|po&s;ing them to be very rich, re&s;olved to &s;ecure their fortune to her&s;elf by making the young Marquis her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>She accordingly threw out a lure that brought him to her hou&s;e; &s;he &s;uffered her&s;elf to be loved, and convinced him that he was not indifferent to her; &s;he led him on by degrees; he was at length altogether fa&s;cinated by her wiles and her charms, &s;o that her conque&s;t was complete; at the &s;ame time &s;he gave him &s;o many commendations, and &s;o much good advice, that the father and mother con&s;idered her as the be&s;t friend they had in the world.</P>
<P>An old lady in the neighbourhood propo&s;ed the marriage on the part of the widow, and the Marquis and Marchione&s;s de la Fayette, dazzled with the &s;plendor of &s;uch an alliance, accepted the propo&s;i|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion with joy. They gave their only &s;on to their
<PB N="154" REF="032623_0153_0FF3F2EEA60477B8">
deare&s;t friend. The youth was on the point of mar|rying a lady whom he adored, and who returned his pa&s;&s;ion; he received the congratulations of his friends, the marriage articles were drawing up, and the wedding clothes and ver&s;es were making.</P>
<P>He was kneeling one morning at the feet of the dear angel, whom love, e&s;teem, and friend&s;hip were &s;oon to make his own for ever; they were enjoying, in a conver&s;ation that touched every &s;tring of tender|ne&s;s and &s;en&s;ibility, a foreta&s;te of their approaching felicity, and laying out a &s;cheme of life in which one delight &s;hould perpetually &s;ucceed another, when a &s;ervant of the Marchione&s;s his mother, arrived in great ha&s;te, and with looks as wild as if he had &s;een an apparition: "I am come, &s;aid he, with news very different from what you think of; the &s;heriff's offi|cers are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my lord's hou&s;e, they have &s;eized all the goods, they talk of &s;ecuring his per&s;on, and as I have not a moment to lo&s;e, I am going to &s;ecure my wages."</P>
<P>"Do not be in &s;uch a violent hurry, &s;aid the Marquis, let us &s;ee a little what this affair is." "Do, &s;ays the widow, run this in&s;tant, puni&s;h the wretches for their in&s;olence."</P>
<P>The Marquis went home directly, and found that his father was already taken to pri&s;on, and that all the &s;ervants were gone off, each having carried away what he could lay his hands upon. He found his mother totally de&s;erted, without &s;uccours, and with|out comfort, &s;itting on the floor, and drowned in tears, with nothing left but the remembrance of her fortune and her beauty, her follies and her faults.</P>
<P>After her &s;on had wept with her till the tumult of his mind a little &s;ub&s;ided, and he was able to &s;peak, he endeavoured to alleviate her di&s;tre&s;s by a reflec|tion that had &s;oothed his own, "do not let us de&s;|pair, &s;aid he, the widow whom I was about to marry is yet more generous than rich; I will an&s;wer for all that is in her power; I will fly to her this moment and bring her hither."</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="032623_0154_0FF3F2F0F11984E0">He returned to his mi&s;tre&s;s with great precipitan|cy, and found her <HI>tete-a-tete</HI> with an hand&s;ome young officer of the army. "What, is it you, Mon&s;ieur de la Fayette, &s;aid &s;he, what in the name of wonder have you to do here? How could you think of leav|ing your poor mother? Go back to her for heaven's &s;ake, and tell her how &s;orry I am for her misfortune; I always wi&s;hed her well; and upon my word as my woman is going away, I will not think of another till I have given her the refu&s;al of the place."&mdash; "My good lad, &s;aid the officer, you &s;eem to be well made, and if you will enter into my corps, I will li&s;t you upon good terms."</P>
<P>The Marquis was &s;truck &s;peechle&s;s with rage and indignation, and bur&s;ting away without reply, he went directly to his old tutor, to pour his &s;orrows into his bo&s;om, and derive comfort from his advice. This gentleman propo&s;ed that he &s;hould undertake the education of children. "Alas, &s;aid the Marquis, I know nothing, you have taught me nothing, and that indeed has been the cau&s;e of all my misfor|tunes." "Write novels, &s;ays a belle e&s;prit who was then pre&s;ent; it is now an excellent expedient to get money at Paris."</P>
<P>The young man now &s;unk deeper in de&s;pair than ever, went as his la&s;t re&s;ource, to a monk of great reputation, who had been his mother's confe&s;&s;or, and who attended nobody in that capacity but peo|ple of rank and condition. The monk, as &s;oon as he &s;aw him, ran towards him in a rapture of &s;urpri&s;e and joy, and cried out, "My God! Mon&s;ieur le Marquis, what do you do here a foot! For heaven's &s;ake where is your coach, and how does the worthy lady Marchione&s;s your mother!" The unhappy youth replied by giving him an account of the ruin of his family; as he advanced in his narrative, the monk's countenance became gradually more grave, more indifferent, and more important. "My &s;on, &s;aid he, we may now &s;ee plainly what God intended for
<PB N="156" REF="032623_0155_0FF3F2F361C8C5F0">
you; riches &s;erve only to corrupt the heart; God has therefore been graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to reduce your mother to beggary; yes, Sir, and a very merciful di&s;pen&s;ation it is, for it will certainly en&s;ure the &s;al|vation of her &s;oul." The Marquis replied, "but father, while we are waiting for that event in the next world, is there no means of obtaining &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance in this?" "My &s;on, &s;aid the monk, God be with you, adieu! there is a lady of great fa&s;hion waiting for me at court."</P>
<P>The poor Marquis, who was very near fainting away at this treatment of the monk, was treated in nearly the &s;ame manner by the whole circle of his acquaintance, and gained more knowledge of the world in half a day than he had done in all the re&s;t of his life.</P>
<P>As he &s;tood rumin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ting in the &s;treet, almo&s;t &s;tu|pified by his misfortunes, a kind of covered tumbril, with leather curtains, came rumbling along, follow|ed by four carts, all heavily laden. In this vehicle &s;at a young man, cleanly but not coar&s;ely clad, with a ruddy &s;un-burnt countenance, that expre&s;&s;ed at once the highe&s;t happine&s;s and good humour. A young, healthy, comely fre&s;h coloured girl, that &s;eemed to be his wife, &s;at jolting by his &s;ide, for the carriage did not move like the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ourt chariot of a petit maitre. The ma&s;ter as he drove on had time to contemplate the Marquis, who &s;tood torpid in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, motionle&s;s, and with his eyes fixed upon the ground. "Ble&s;s my &s;oul, &s;aid he, when he came almo&s;t up to him, &s;urely this is not Fayette!" At this name the Marquis &s;tarted as from a dream, and looked up, and the driver in&s;tantly &s;topped his cart. "Yes, by my faith, &s;aid he, it is Fayette him&s;elf;" and with that he made but one leap to the ground, and caught him in his arms; Fayette at once recol|lected his old &s;chool-fellow Gra&s;&s;e, and his face was in&s;tantly covered with confu&s;ion and tears. "You have for&s;aken me, &s;aid Colin, but you may be as
<PB N="157" REF="032623_0156_0FF3F2F4EBA9AC60">
great a lord as you will, I am determined to love you for all that." Fayette who&s;e tenderne&s;s and confu&s;ion increa&s;ed every moment, told him in a few words a part of his hi&s;tory. "Come along, &s;aid Gra&s;&s;e, you &s;hall go home with me to the inn where I put up, and tell the re&s;t at your lei&s;ure; &s;alute my little wife, this is &s;he, and let us make ha&s;te to dinner."</P>
<P>Gra&s;&s;e and his wife, and the Marquis, thus pro|ceeded on foot following the baggage. "Pray, &s;aid Fayette, what is all this, does it belong to you?" "Yes, &s;aid Gra&s;&s;e, the whole belongs to me and my wife, we are ju&s;t come out of the country; I am at the head of a good manufacture of bra&s;s and tin; I married the daughter of a man who had acquired very con&s;iderable &s;ub&s;tance by making and &s;elling a commodity that is equally nece&s;&s;ary to rich and poor; we work very hard; Providence has ble&s;&s;ed our en|deavours; we continue to get forward in the world; we are very happy in our&s;elves, and thank God we have it in our power to a&s;&s;i&s;t our friend Fayette; do not be a Marquis any longer, all the great peo|ple in the world are not worth one true friend; you &s;hall go along with me into the country, you &s;hall learn my trade which will be ea&s;ily done, I will take you in partner, and we will live cheerfully together in the ob&s;cure but happy retreat where we were born."</P>
<P>Fayette heard this propo&s;al with unde&s;cribeable &s;en&s;ations; his heart was divided between grief and joy, tenderne&s;s and &s;hame, and turning to his true friend &s;aid, in an humble voice, "all my gay friends have de&s;erted me, and Gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;e whom I injuriou&s;ly neglected, has afforded me that comfort, which from him I did not de&s;erve." What a lecture is this for tho&s;e who are entering into life? The virtue of Gra&s;&s;e called out the virtue which lay hidden in the brea&s;t of Fayette, and which all his habits of folly and di&s;&s;ipation had not de&s;troyed. He felt a
<PB N="158" REF="032623_0157_0FF3F2F6755755A0">
&s;ecret repugnance to de&s;ert his father and mother. "We will take care of thy mother, &s;aid Gra&s;&s;e, and as to the good man thy father, who is in pri&s;on, I know a little of the world, and his creditors know|ing he has nothing to &s;atisfy them, will compound their debts for a trifle, and I will take upon me to make an end of matters with them, and &s;et him once more clear in the world." Gra&s;&s;e was very &s;oon as good as his word; the old man was di&s;charged out of pri&s;on, and his creditors gave him a general relea&s;e. Fayette returned with his friends into his native country, and took his parents with him, who followed their original profe&s;&s;ion. Fayette married Gra&s;&s;e's &s;i&s;ter, who being of the &s;ame amiable di&s;|po&s;ition with her brother, made him very happy; and Fayette the father, Fayette the mother, and Fayette the &s;on, were at la&s;t thoroughly convinced, that happine&s;s is not to be found in vanity.</P>

<HEAD>New Ob&s;ervations on Apparitions.</HEAD>
<P>AT a little di&s;tance from an old gentleman's hou&s;e in the country, among the ruins of an old abbey, there is a long walk of aged elms, which are &s;hot up &s;o very high, that when one pa&s;&s;es under them, the rooks and crows that re&s;t upon the top of them, &s;eem to be cawing in another region. I am very much delighted with this &s;ort of noi&s;e, which I con&s;ider as a kind of natural prayer to that Being who &s;upplies the wants of his whole creation, and who, in the beautiful language of the P&s;alms, feedeth the young ravens that call upon him. I like this retire|ment the better, becau&s;e of an ill report it lies under of being <HI>haunted</HI>; for which rea&s;on (as I have been told in the family) no living creature ever walks in it be&s;ides the chaplain. My good friend the butler de&s;ired me with a grave face, not to venture my&s;elf
<PB N="159" REF="032623_0158_0FF3F2F95969DFE8">
after &s;un-&s;et, for that one of the footmen had been frighted almo&s;t out of his wits by a &s;pirit that ap|peared to him in the &s;hape of a black hor&s;e without a head; to which he added, that about a month ago, one of the maids coming home late that way, with a pail of milk upon her head, heard &s;uch a ru&s;tling that &s;he let it fall.</P>
<P>I was taking a walk in this place la&s;t night be|tween the hours of nine and ten, and could not but fancy it one of the mo&s;t proper &s;cenes in the world for a gho&s;t to appear in. The ruins of the abbey are &s;cattered up and down on every &s;ide, and half covered with ivy and elder bu&s;hes, the harbours of &s;everal &s;olitary birds, which &s;eldom make their ap|pearance until the du&s;k of the evening. The place was formerly a church-yard, and has &s;till &s;everal marks in it of graves and burying places; there is &s;uch an echo among the old ruins and vaults, that if you &s;tamp but a little louder than ordinary, you hear the &s;ound repeated. At the &s;ame time, the walk of elms, with the croaking of the ravens, which from time to time are heard from the tops of them, looks exceeding &s;olemn and venerable. The&s;e objects naturally rai&s;e &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and attention; and when night heightens the awfulne&s;s of the place, and pours out her &s;upernumerary horrors upon every thing in it, I do not at all wonder that weak minds fill it with &s;pectres and apparitions.</P>
<P>Mr. Locke, in his Chapter of the A&s;&s;ociation of Ideas, has very curious remarks to &s;how how by the prejudice of education, one idea often introduces into the mind a whole &s;et that bear no re&s;emblance to one another in the nature of things. Among &s;everal examples of this kind he produces the fol|lowing in&s;tance: "The ideas of goblins and &s;prights, have really no more to do with darkne&s;s than light; yet let but a fooli&s;h maid inculcate the&s;e often on the mind of a boy, and rai&s;e them there together, po&s;&s;ibly he &s;hall never be able to &s;eparate them again
<PB N="160" REF="032623_0159_0FF3F2FB8D9A21C8">
&s;o long as he lives, but darkne&s;s &s;hall ever afterwards bring with it tho&s;e frightful ideas, and they &s;hall be &s;o joined, that he can no more bear the one nor the other." As I was walking in this &s;olitude, where the du&s;k of the evening con&s;pired with &s;o many other occa&s;ions of terrors, I ob&s;erved a cow grazing not far from me, which an imagination that was apt to &s;tartle, might ea&s;ily have con&s;trued into a black hor&s;e without an head, and I dare &s;ay the poor footman lo&s;t his wits upon &s;ome &s;uch trivial occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>My old friend in the country has often told me with a good deal of mirth, that at his fir&s;t coming to his e&s;tate, he found three parts of his hou&s;e alto|gether u&s;ele&s;s; that the be&s;t room in it had the rep|utation of being haunted, and by that means was locked up; that noi&s;es had been heard in his long gallery, &s;o that he could not get a &s;ervant to enter it after eight o'clock at night; that the door of one of his chambers was nailed up, becau&s;e there was a &s;tory in the family, that a butler had formerly hang|ed him&s;elf in it; and that his mother who lived to a great age, had &s;hut up half the rooms in the hou&s;e, in which either her hu&s;band, a &s;on, or daughter had died. My friend &s;eeing his habitation reduced to &s;o &s;mall a compa&s;s, and him&s;elf in a manner &s;hut out of his own hou&s;e, upon the death of his mother, ordered all the apartments to be flung open, and exorci&s;ed by his chaplain, who lay in every room one after another, and by that means di&s;&s;ipated the fears which had &s;o long reigned in the family.</P>

<HEAD>General In&s;tructions from a Mother to a Daugh|ter, for her Conduct in Life.</HEAD>
<P>IN the plan of your education, my dear Julia, I have con&s;ulted your glory more than my own, and &s;hall be completely happy to &s;ee you perfect,
<PB N="161" REF="032623_0160_0FF3F2FD1622F248">
without any vanity in having doubly formed you, by blood and precepts. The only plea&s;ure I pro|po&s;e to my&s;elf is &s;eeing you follow them, which your docility in li&s;tening flatters me you will do. I give you my in&s;tructions in writing, that in what place or condition you are, they may be always pre&s;ent with you, and that when death deprives you of me, it may not at the &s;ame time rob you of that which may be more u&s;eful to you than my&s;elf. A cu&s;tom wi&s;ely introduced into the world, having made me tru&s;t your bringing up to per&s;ons who are, by being &s;hut in a cloi&s;ter, &s;ecured from all worldly troubles, will therefore prevent two things equally unhappy; either too great an inclination for a mona&s;tic life, or too violent for an abhorrence of it; be upon your guard, my deare&s;t Julia, again&s;t both. Youth always fond of novelty, often &s;urrenders it&s;elf without con&s;ulting rea&s;on. The tranquillity of a mona&s;tic life, the enticing di&s;cour&s;es of tho&s;e who&s;e only aim is to make you embrace the vows they are already bound by, make me appre|hend your adding to the number of &s;o many young creatures, who are, by an acce&s;&s;ible grate often ren|dered more wretched than tho&s;e who&s;e morals have been corrupted by the world. When remor&s;e a&s;|&s;aults one in the cloi&s;ter, we mu&s;t be very particu|larly endowed with grace to find any remedy, &s;ince the only ones that can be applied, are the very cau&s;es of our affliction; as retirement, prayer, and a reg|ular religious life. Some are then apt to paint the world in &s;uch lively and beautiful colours, that they burn with impatience to be in it, and cannot forbear lamenting the impo&s;&s;ibility there is of ever doing it. How will the mind, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, be racked with ten thou&s;and torturing ideas! We think tho&s;e very things fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed with charms, which are in reality &s;ubjects only of &s;orrow and vexation; vice appears dre&s;&s;ed in the &s;hape of virtue, and without &s;inning in the practical part, we do &s;o doubly in the theoretic.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="032623_0161_0FF3F2FF4B69B508">When a per&s;on has lived in the world, and has the misfortune to give into &s;ome of the little follies of it, the remor&s;e of an irregular conduct, and the di&s;gu&s;t of a life filled with intrigue, every one &s;ees in proper colours, and we look on retirement as the mo&s;t &s;overeign ble&s;&s;ing. We ought therefore to know our&s;elves thoroughly before we enter into &s;uch a life; but perhaps you will &s;ay, mu&s;t we then plunge our&s;elves into vice, that our return to virtue may be with the more vigour? No, that is not what I mean, but I would have you be a witne&s;s of the failings of others, without erring your&s;elf, that ill examples may &s;erve as a pre&s;ervative to your di&s;|cretion; and that comparing the troubles, noi&s;e, hurry, and confu&s;ion of an intere&s;ting and intrig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ing world, with the &s;erene comforts of retirement you may con&s;ult your heart in the choice, and t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">n embrace that to which you are mo&s;t inclined. We may live as regularly in the world as in a cloi&s;ter, and perhaps better; a generous mind, when it has the power of doing evil, will rather avoid it, than when it is under a con&s;traint.</P>
<P>The charms with which heaven has ble&s;&s;ed you, while they delight the eye, make me tremble for you hereafter. Beauty has often been the rock on which virtue has &s;plit, when care has not been taken to enrich the mind with mea&s;ures which may defend it in all the various changes of life. A &s;plendid for|tune is ever attended by luxury, who&s;e companion is coquetry. The adoration of the men, and the perpetual flatteries from them are often too plea&s;ing to our vanity, and by li&s;tening to a number, the heart is uncertain in its determination, and we in|&s;en&s;ibly give up to a crowd that reputation which we fear to tru&s;t with one per&s;on, and which ought to be dearer to us than our life. Poverty, misfor|tunes, and a life embittered with eternal vexations, are no le&s;s fatal to virtue; &s;uch a woman is apt to make u&s;e of her beauty to &s;ubdue her enemies, to
<PB N="163" REF="032623_0162_0FF3F300D9615C38">
procure her friends in time of need; &s;he meets it is probable with dangerous con&s;olers, and her hon|our is the &s;acrifice to gratitude. To prevent the&s;e accidents, wi&s;dom is the only means, but endeavour to be wi&s;e without affectation; wi&s;dom does not require &s;o much outward &s;hew as vice and &s;everity. Be prudent without being a prude; let your mode&s;ty be accompanied with gaiety, and your re&s;erve with good nature; apply your&s;elf to learn what will em|belli&s;h your mind, but let not vanity attend your knowledge; let your philo&s;ophy be Chri&s;tian; be affable and obliging to all, intimate but with few; pity the misfortunes you are in no pro&s;pect of feel|ing, behave without too much &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to your equals, and without pride to your inferiors; com|fort the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed of all conditions; do nothing but what is prai&s;e worthy, without aiming at prai&s;e; for the o&s;tentation of a good action often eclip&s;es the glory which it would otherwi&s;e de&s;erve. If fate allots you to a happy marriage, make the ble&s;&s;ing permanent by love, virtue and a generous confidence. If on the contrary you are unfortunately &s;o, and your mind torn and di&s;tracted with the agonies of dome&s;tic jars, look out for friends who have a greater regard for your virtue than your beauty; and if by that means you get no relief, &s;eek it from him who alone can extricate us out of the deepe&s;t di&s;tre&s;s. If you love your hu&s;band pa&s;&s;ionately, and he but ill returns your tenderne&s;s, let mildne&s;s, complai&s;ance, and a blamele&s;s conduct, be the only arms wherewith you combat his ill humour; jealou&s;y, &s;ullenne&s;s, or a peevi&s;h melancholy, will never regain a heart liable to wandering. If the match is di&s;proportioned, and he happens to be very agreeable in his humour, but the contrary in his per&s;on, never cea&s;e endeavouring to conquer your di&s;like, and remember the beauties of the mind are by far the mo&s;t preferable. If you chance to be equally indifferent to each other, let not that draw you into any irregularities, &s;hun the

<P>It is in &s;uch circum&s;tances as the&s;e that it is diffi|cult to pre&s;erve one's virtue; but then it is at the&s;e times, that it is mo&s;t requi&s;ite, and appears with greater lu&s;tre. A woman perfectly happy, who is not wanting in her duty, is e&s;teemed without being prai&s;ed, becau&s;e having no complaint, &s;he has no pretence for doing otherwi&s;e; but a woman that is unfortunate and yet wi&s;e, &s;eems to exceed even ex|pectation. The virgin or the widow &s;tate al&s;o &s;eems to me as much or more expo&s;ed to danger, as a young woman that is left without father or mother, and entirely mi&s;tre&s;s of her actions, cannot be too cir|cum&s;pect in them. She takes no &s;tep that does not endanger her reputation. If &s;he keeps a great deal of company, &s;he pa&s;&s;es for a coquette; if &s;he con|fines her&s;elf to a few &s;elect friends, &s;he then has &s;ome &s;ecret intrigue; in &s;hort, every body pa&s;&s;es their judgment upon her with le&s;s charity, becau&s;e they know &s;he has nobody to be re&s;pon&s;ible for her con|duct. It is then I advi&s;e retirement, but without entering into religious orders. If you &s;hould marry, and your hu&s;band die, take care not to imitate tho&s;e women, who think, becau&s;e they have nobody to whom they are obliged to be accountable for what they do, they may with &s;afety abandon them&s;elves to an irregular conduct, believing that under the umbrage of their crape, they may conceal the loo&s;e inclinations of their hearts. A widow ought to be more nice in her behaviour than either a wife or a maid; the &s;tate &s;he has pa&s;&s;ed through &s;hould make her ob&s;erve a gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">corum, &s;ince &s;he ought to re|&s;ume the mode&s;ty and innocence of a maid, with the knowledge of a wife.

<HEAD>The Penitent Gho&s;t, or Wonderful Stratagem. A WHIMSICAL TALE.</HEAD>
<P>JACK WILDING, the &s;on of a late worthy citi|zen, was contracted, by the mutual con&s;ent of the parents, to Mi&s;s Seymour, the daughter of a very re&s;pectable merchant; but &s;uch was the wild infat|uated di&s;po&s;ition of the young man, that, becoming an ea&s;y dupe to plea&s;ure, he not only &s;lighted, but totally neglected the fair object of this contract&mdash; Eliza, who was partial to her unworthy intended, &s;aw with regret the volatile character of her unde|&s;erving lover&mdash;for <HI>lover</HI> was a title he always a&s;pired to, in hopes of rendering him&s;elf agreeable in the
<PB N="166" REF="032623_0165_0FF3F30759ECEEB0">
eyes of every young lady; but to Eliza <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he was <HI>le&s;s</HI> a lover, than to tho&s;e fair ones who were le&s;s worthy of his love.&mdash;In &s;hort, he was a general gallant, and would have taken unwarrantable liberties with Mi&s;s Sey<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">our, had not her delicacy and virtue prudently defended them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Wilding, upon the death of his father, became more and more the libertine; while &s;uch was Mi&s;s Seymour's &s;ituation, that &s;he was entirely &s;ubject by this contract, to the wavering di&s;po&s;ition of Wilding; unable, except upon a very &s;evere forfeit (which her father would not &s;ubmit to) to procure a liberation, and be free to marry another. By &s;ome unaccount|able means indeed &s;he had given her <HI>heart</HI> to the man who thus deferred the acceptance of her hand, and by a cruel procra&s;tination proved that it was never his intention to fulfil an engagement, which unfortunately he was not compelled to by any pen|alty in the contract, through the neglect of Mr. Sey|mour, who never &s;u&s;pected his incon&s;tancy and ca|price; of this however the old gentleman &s;oon re|pented; and no doubt it was the &s;ole occa&s;ion of his &s;udden death; for he &s;aw the unhappy fate of his poor orphan child.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Seymour, now fatherle&s;s, became more &s;ub|ject to the in&s;ults of Wilding; who, laughing at her punctilious notions of virtue, made many unworthy attempts to injure it; however, to the great HONOR of Mi&s;s Seymour be it added, all his endeavours were happily ineffectual.</P>
<P>The young lady being rather in a &s;olitary &s;itua|tion, and more in want of a female companion than many of her &s;ex, now prevailed on the daughter of a late worthy friend of her decea&s;ed father to remain with her a few months; hoping by her advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance not to <HI>recover</HI>&mdash;(for it never was <HI>Won</HI>) but obtain, and then <HI>&s;ecure</HI> the affection of this harum|&s;carum youth. Lydia Harcourt, who&s;e nature was exceedingly good and &s;ympathetic, readily acqui|e&s;ced
<PB N="167" REF="032623_0166_0FF3F309913FA640">
with the invitation; for &s;he pitied her unfor|tunate companion, and, notwith&s;tanding her ju&s;t hatred to Wilding, was induced, by her tran&s;cen|dant love for Eliza, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e both her con&s;tant com|panion and occa&s;ional friend.</P>
<P>During the vi&s;it of Mi&s;s Harcourt, Wilding was a more con&s;tant gue&s;t; but the rea&s;on &s;oon became evident&mdash;he wi&s;hed to add to the li&s;t of his <HI>ruined</HI> favorites, the bo&s;om friend and confidant of his con|tracted Eliza. One day when Lydia was nobly in|terceding for the wronged Mi&s;s Seymour, and by the eloquence of friend&s;hip pleading her cau&s;e&mdash; during which time the trembling Eliza was atten|tively li&s;tening&mdash;the thoughtle&s;s youth attributed all his neglect, all his incon&s;tancy, to the tran&s;cen|dant beauty of the fair advocate.</P>
<P>"O!" cried he in a tone of rhap&s;ody and well-di&s;&s;embled love, "how is it po&s;&s;ible that you can behold my indifference to Mi&s;s Seymour, and not immediately perceive the cau&s;e, thou dear bewitch|ing thief&mdash;it is thou who ha&s;t &s;tolen my heart, and rendered me totally inc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pable of fulfilling the con|tract with Eliza&mdash;but &s;mile upon me now, I conjure you, by your friend&s;hip for Mi&s;s Seymour, &s;mile&mdash; only &s;atisfy my ardent pa&s;&s;ion for you, and it may be the better for your friend; for by extingui&s;hing the flame which has been long, untimely kindled within my heart for you, perhaps it may be the means of kindling another for your friend Eliza; for then, whoever is dear to you mu&s;t certainly be &s;o to one&mdash;"</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Harcourt li&s;tened to this enthu&s;ia&s;tic declar|ation with profound attention, and when he had concluded, &s;he coolly withdrew her hand, and, &s;mi|ling, wi&s;hed that her friend Eliza was pre&s;ent to witne&s;s his di&s;&s;embled pa&s;&s;ion, as then, &s;he was very &s;ure, all e&s;teem &s;he could entertain for him mu&s;t certainly be at an end; and that &s;he would &s;uffer any thing on her part before &s;he would marry him.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="032623_0167_0FF3F30BCC1E6AC0">This very deliberate manner of addre&s;s and re|mon&s;trance had no kind of effect upon Wilding&mdash;On the contrary, it only &s;erved to &s;pur him on more in his wicked de&s;igns, and excite new projects of mali|cious gallantry. He now proceeded to violence. Such was Eliza's &s;ituation, that &s;he did not interpo&s;e &mdash;fearful if &s;he had di&s;covered her&s;elf, &s;he would &s;eem to have &s;u&s;pected the friend&s;hip of Mi&s;s Har|court, or met with the ill-timed &s;arca&s;ms of an un|thinking libertine&mdash;However, the &s;ea&s;onable in|terruption of Jenny the &s;ervant, put an end at pre&s;|ent to Mr. Wilding's intention. He &s;eemed exceed|ingly mortified at the intru&s;ion, and &s;peedily took leave.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Harcourt was determined to be revenged on him for this audacious attempt. She communicated her &s;entiments to Jenny, who wi&s;hed much to invent &s;ome &s;tratagem for puni&s;hing the pre&s;umption of the youth, and make him at the &s;ame time &s;en&s;ible of the injury he had offered Mi&s;s Harcourt.</P>
<P>Eliza, who had overheard their wi&s;hes to be ac|complices in a plot, now re&s;olved, as &s;he was mo&s;t particularly concerned, to be her&s;elf the inventre&s;s. She accordingly imparted her de&s;ign to a nephew of the late Mr. Seymour's; who, having fortunately procured an acquaintance with Wilding, a&s;&s;ured her that every thing in his power he would, without the lea&s;t he&s;itation, accompli&s;h. This young man, we &s;hall call Charles, a&s;&s;ociated on purpo&s;e with Wild|ing; &s;eemed an advocate for plea&s;ure like him&s;elf, and &s;hared in all manner of wild intoxication.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Seymour had now moved her re&s;idence to a country village, and, in order to allure Wilding to follow them, Charles (who was prudently admitted into the &s;ecret) very &s;agaciou&s;ly laid a wager with his friend Wilding, that he would never accompli&s;h his de&s;ign over Mi&s;s Harcourt. This &s;timulated the young man to follow them; and Charles&punc; with Col. Riot (who was not in the plot) were con&s;equently his companions.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="032623_0168_0FF3F30D545F06E0">The place which Mi&s;s Seymour repaired to, was a lonely unneighbourly town. The cottage, formerly a ca&s;tle, was large, wild, and di&s;ordered&mdash;a gloomy a&s;pect hung over the place, and was &s;eemingly well-&s;uited for the daring project which ran in her head. &mdash;Jenny, and Tom a man-&s;ervant, were the only attendants which &s;he took.</P>
<P>Wilding, in order to gain his purpo&s;e over Mi&s;s Harcourt, attempted to bribe Jenny. This &s;agacious girl, to avoid &s;u&s;picion, accepted his money (which was rather tempting, being plentifully offered) with little or no reluctance, &s;eeming rather to acquie&s;ce with his de&s;igns, and inclined to give the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which he pretended to want &s;o much.</P>
<P>Charles, on the evening intended for Wilding's bold e&s;&s;ay, now under pretence of &s;piriting him up to action, invited him to a bottle. This was the time for him to perform his arduous part, on which depended the whole &s;tratagem, and this he did both honorably and &s;ucce&s;sfully. He &s;eized an happy opportunity of mixing opium with Wilding's liquor, which, in addition to the &s;pirits (for Charles made him drink more than u&s;ual) had &s;uch an effect over his under&s;tanding, as to render him totally in&s;en&s;i|ble and almo&s;t dead.</P>
<P>While in this in&s;en&s;ible &s;tate of ignorant inebria|tion, Charles had the unfeeling body of his friend conveyed, by proper &s;ervants, to a room which was on purpo&s;e fitted up in this melancholy and wild re&s;idence that Mi&s;s Seymour had de&s;ignedly cho&s;en: it was hung with black, and every thing that could render it di&s;mal and awful was mo&s;t indu&s;triou&s;ly executed: the &s;kulls and bones of departed friends were here and there &s;cattered. <HI>Memento mori</HI> &s;eemed to be the motto of all around; a coffin with glim|mering lights was carefully placed before him. In &s;hort, the whole &s;cene was both intere&s;ting and tremendous.</P>
<P>Wilding, who had been, during his tran&s;lation,
<PB N="170" REF="032623_0169_0FF3F30EDBC61798">
ignorant of all that was &s;aid or done, how &s;nored away his intoxication, and &s;uddenly awaked in this room of horror; he rubbed his eyes, for &s;ome time gazing with wonder around, then doubtful that he was yet awake, he rubbed again; he looked at the &s;kulls; took them up in his hands, then gazing at the arms and legs he went to the door, beheld two mutes who looked horror and death; he &s;poke to them, but they gave no an&s;wer, nor &s;eemed to per|ceive him; he returned, walked about, beheld the coffin; this rou&s;ed his curio&s;ity; he read the &s;uper|&s;cription, and was no doubt a&s;toni&s;hed to find that John Wilding (him&s;elf) died &s;uddenly the very day he was drinking with his friend Charles. This amazed him; he could not believe his eyes, and in|deed no wonder; he was however re&s;olved to exam|ine more clo&s;ely into the matter, and endeavour to open the coffin for the <HI>plea&s;ure</HI> of &s;eeing his own dead body; but herein he was di&s;appointed; for the pro|jectors of the &s;cheme had it &s;o well &s;crewed down, that all his ability was in vain; now, in a &s;tate of melancholy reflection, he &s;tood&punc; &s;ome time; at la&s;t Mi&s;s Seymour and her confidant entered in deep mourning; he addre&s;&s;ed them, but they took no notice of him; he &s;poke to them, but they did not an&s;wer; and, when they did break &s;ilence, their words were entirely foreign to the que&s;tions propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>"I will&mdash;cried Mi&s;s Seymour in a fit of &s;eeming di&s;traction&mdash;I will give vent to my &s;orrow and bewail the untimely death of this poor youth."</P>
<P>"No, don't," cried Wilding, "look at me, I am not dead, upon my &s;oul."</P>
<P>Totally indifferent to Mr. Wilding's reque&s;t, &s;he mourned mo&s;t plentifully over the coffin, and now and then would &s;tare him in the face, to convince him that &s;he did <HI>not &s;ee him.</HI></P>
<P>"Come away;" exclaimed Mi&s;s Harcourt, who under pretence was admini&s;tering all the con&s;olation in her power, "come, you did not know the char|acter
<PB N="171" REF="032623_0170_0FF3F311C5C82DC8">
of this man, or you would not now lament his de&s;erved fate; he had the impudence (I would not confe&s;s it to you, my dear, only he is now dead and gone) to attack even my virtue, and &s;eek my utter ruin; la&s;t night I am told he had determined to complete his evil purpo&s;e; and heaven (I am &s;ure) inflicted this puni&s;hment upon him, for which I mu&s;t always be thankful, to fru&s;trate his dangerous de&s;ign; otherwi&s;e he would not &s;o &s;uddenly have died of that &s;mall cru&s;t of bread, which I am told &s;tuck in his throat."</P>
<P>"Speak not &s;o har&s;hly I conjure you," cried Mi&s;s Seymour, "he was young, and &s;urely youth is &s;ome plea for his foibles; look at his coffin, he is no more than twenty, poor young man, had he lived, no doubt he would have atoned for all his errors."</P>
<P>"Perhaps, my dear, it is happier for you that he is now gone; con&s;ider that you are thereby relea&s;ed from a dete&s;table contract; you are free, and I am &s;ure, if men &s;uffer puni&s;hment after their death, he mu&s;t feel NOW for his cruel treatment to you, and his wicked de&s;igns upon me."</P>
<P>"Suffer!" echoed Wilding, "dear! dear! I believe I &s;hall always be in hell."</P>
<P>Jenny now entered, and &s;eemed to bewail with equal &s;orrow the untimely fate of poor Wilding: he did all in his power to &s;hew him&s;elf, but &s;uch was his misfortune, he could not <HI>appear</HI> to any; it was now Jenny di&s;covered his intention of procuring ad|mittance to Mi&s;s Harcourt by the bribes he had given her; in &s;hort, all his &s;ins and iniquities &s;eem|ed to &s;tare him in the face, and ri&s;e, as it were, in judgment again&s;t him.</P>
<P>The &s;ervant brought in word that the undertaker was ready to inter the body; they all prepared, as mourners, to attend this awful funeral, even Charles now appeared in fable dre&s;s with watery eyes; the ladies went out fir&s;t, and Wilding, who was left alone with his companion, endeavoured all in his power
<PB N="172" REF="032623_0171_0FF3F313F7344F18">
to <HI>appear</HI> to him, but to no effect, he could not, for he <HI>would</HI> not &s;ee him.</P>
<P>"Well by the&mdash;no I won't &s;wear as I am dead," exclaimed Wilding, "but by my &s;oul, for that is &s;till <HI>living,</HI> if you won't hear me, you &s;hall <HI>feel</HI> me."</P>
<P>Upon this Wilding gave Charles a mo&s;t violent knock on the head, but, happily, the other attribu|ted it to a &s;udden head-ach, and convinced poor Wilding that he was a penitent gho&s;t indeed.</P>
<P>The di&s;mal &s;ituation of our hero cannot be de&s;cri|bed, particularly when he &s;aw Charles, his bo&s;om friend, preparing to pay his &s;ad re&s;pects to his &s;up|po&s;ed remains&mdash; The women, Mi&s;s Seymour&punc; Mi&s;s Harcourt, and Jenny, went into one coach. Wild|ing re&s;olved to be among them, and, both out of re&s;pect to them, and love for the memory of him&s;elf, joined them in this &s;trange excur&s;ion&mdash;the ladies artfully took no notice of his entering the carriage, and he &s;at between Eliza and Lydia, who alternately lamented his fate, particularly the latter, who hoped (with a &s;erious face while gazing inattentive to him) that heaven would have pity on his youth, and for|give him the manifold crimes he was guilty of.</P>
<P>"But, alas!" continued Mi&s;s Harcourt, "when I think on the heinous vices of which he has been guilty, I fear that brim&s;tone and fire mu&s;t be his eternal lot&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Heaven deliver me," ejaculated the terrified Wilding, who became con&s;cious of the &s;ins he had committed, and was rather apprehen&s;ive of future puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>In this affecting manner the company proceeded; while Jenny, who &s;at oppo&s;ite to Wilding, was rail|ing violently again&s;t his juvenile follies, the tender Eliza be&s;eeching her to de&s;i&s;t, for this was no time to war with the du&s;t&mdash;While thus they were add|ing &s;till to the terrors of Wilding, to complete both his a&s;toni&s;hment and perturbation, they &s;ung the following

<P>They now de&s;cended from their coaches in &s;olemn and &s;ilent &s;orrow; Wilding approached the ground where he &s;aw him&s;elf laid. The funeral rites (being on purpo&s;e paid for by Mi&s;s Seymour) were duly performed, and Wilding was left in the church-yard to bewail his di&s;mal and untimely end.</P>
<P>Now was the time when this unfortunate youth began to repent; now was the time when he &s;aw his follies, and wi&s;hed him&s;elf alive again, that he might lead a <HI>new life.</HI> Eliza, who had &s;o contrived that he &s;hould be left behind, returned as it were to mourn over the remains of her dear but unworthy incon&s;tant&mdash;Wilding beheld her well-di&s;&s;embled grief; he looked at her, and wept likewi&s;e&mdash;She, with &s;ea&s;onable cunning, &s;tarted at his appearance.</P>
<P>"Good heaven!" exclaimed &s;he, "it is&mdash;it is the &s;hade of Mr. Wilding&mdash;"</P>
<P>Wilding was happy that &s;he <HI>&s;aw</HI> him&mdash;he con|fe&s;&s;ed that he was that unfortunate youth who was ju&s;t now buried; he implored her forgivene&s;s, and earne&s;tly prayed that &s;he would intercede for him
<PB N="174" REF="032623_0173_0FF3F3170F3D17B0">
with her friend, and procure his pardon for the in|&s;ults he had offered: "this perhaps may be the means (he added) of rendering me &s;ome re&s;t; for I a&s;&s;ure you, though I do <HI>&s;leep</HI> in this yard, I have not had one moment's <HI>quiet</HI> &s;ince I died."</P>
<P>During this intere&s;ting &s;cene Colonel Riot hap|pened to pa&s;s by, and, being "ripe for &s;port," hailed his friend Wilding, who&s;e pallid and melan|choly countenance &s;omewhat a&s;toni&s;hed him.</P>
<P>"Heyday!" cries he, "What is the matter, Jack?"</P>
<P>"And do <HI>you</HI> &s;ee me too&mdash;O then, my friend, take warning&mdash;beware of my untimely end&mdash;forbear the&s;e unlimited bounds of plea&s;ure&mdash;be wi&s;e ere it be too late."</P>
<P>"Why? Why? What the devil is the matter? You &s;eem to be quite dull&mdash;you that were once <HI>all alive.</HI> Come, let us take a bottle together."</P>
<P>"A&s;k me to take a bottle with you!&mdash;What do you mea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">? Con&s;ider what I <HI>am.</HI>"</P>
<P>"Why, what the devil are you? I thought you were an <HI>hone&s;t fellow</HI>&mdash;Come&mdash;O! Mi&s;s Seymour, are you here?&mdash;So, &s;o, I &s;ee what you have been both at&mdash;but what an odd place you have cho&s;en to meet in. Come, what's the matter with me?"</P>
<P>"The matter! Why do you a&s;k&mdash;Why do you in&s;ult me? O beware, my friend, le&s;t a cru&s;t of bread may fatally explain to you what has happened to me&mdash;"</P>
<P>At this in&s;tant, Charles, who had accompanied Eliza, and during this &s;cene &s;ecreted him&s;elf behind a tree, di&s;covered him&s;elf by a loud laugh&mdash;the noi&s;e of which &s;urpri&s;ed Wilding; for, &s;truck with every &s;ound, he &s;eemed apprehen&s;ive that the <HI>devil</HI> was coming for him&mdash;he was happy however to &s;ee <HI>him</HI> in the &s;hape of Charles his friend, who now re|vealed the plot; flattering him&s;elf that the effect thereof was both happy and &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>Wilding, rejoicing to hear that he was not dead, availed him&s;elf of the glad opportunity of repenting;
<PB N="175" REF="032623_0174_0FF3F31934278C18">
and changed the rites of his funeral to the tranquil ceremonies of Hymen; while Lydia, participating of the univer&s;al happine&s;s, made a double union by giving her hand to Charles.</P>

<HEAD>The Maid of the Village. A WONDERFUL TALE.</HEAD>
<P>THE fair Matilda was placed under the care of an old lady, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a cottage &s;ome di&s;tance from town. Her birth was ob&s;cure, but her man|ners declared &s;he was de&s;cended from noble blood. It happened that Wilmot, the adopted heir of Sir Jeffery Wood&s;tock, beheld and loved her&mdash;the bar|onet approved his choice&mdash;for the charms of Matil|da far exceeded the old man's conception, or even the de&s;cription of the lover.</P>
<P>Wilmot had been the &s;on of an hone&s;t but unfor|tunate man; he had found a friend in Sir Jeffery beyond his warme&s;t expectations: for &s;o great was this baronet's partiality for the youth, that he not only indulged him in all his juvenile pur&s;uits, but even appointed him as heir to his large fortune.</P>
<P>This uncommon partiality, the reader may &s;up|po&s;e, re&s;ulted from uncommon genero&s;ity. But no: revenge, malignity, and all the &s;ecret impul&s;es of inward re&s;entment, occa&s;ioned this apparent benev|olence; his own &s;on was abandoned, di&s;inherited&mdash; and why? The unfortunate youth had married a worthy but an indigent fair, and, being provoked that he &s;hould have &s;o little regard to his lineage and con&s;equence, determined never to &s;ee him more. In vain did Henry (for that was his name) endeavour to recover his father's good graces; the baronet was inexorable, and it was entirely owing to the heat of his pa&s;&s;ion, that Wilmot, the &s;on of his neighbour,
<PB N="176" REF="032623_0175_0FF3F31C08B02EA0">
was appointed heir to his e&s;tate. This adopted &s;on was exceedingly young, but very good natured. He was ignorant of the cau&s;e of Sir Jeffery's &s;eeming humanity; and, like the majority of &s;pectators, at|tributed all to his urbanity; but Henry &s;eized many an opportunity of conver&s;ing with the young man, and, being unknown to him, very wi&s;ely re&s;olved to keep the name of his obdurate parent &s;till concealed. They became &s;o intimate at la&s;t, that Wilmot fre|quently invited him to his hou&s;e, anxious, he &s;aid, to introduce him to Sir Jeffery; but Henry by con|tinual eva&s;ions declined this, and always contrived &s;o as to meet the young man when his father was out of the way.</P>
<P>Wilmot, &s;truck with the appearance of his new friend, was exceedingly de&s;irous to know his &s;tory; he often interrogated him about his parentage, and at la&s;t Henry gave the following account.</P>
<P>"I was the &s;on of both a titled and a rich man&mdash;I &s;ay I <HI>was,</HI> becau&s;e I no longer <HI>am</HI>&mdash;and yet he is not dead, as you may naturally &s;uppo&s;e, by this de|claration;&mdash; I am&mdash;Oh! my dear friend, bani&s;hed from his pre&s;ence, becau&s;e I happened to marry the daughter of an humble farmer, who&s;e virtue and beauty, I deemed a &s;ufficient portion; and had it plea&s;ed heaven that my dear Euphemia had lived to ble&s;s the remainder of my life, I would &s;till have &s;miled at the frowns of my father, for her &s;ake&mdash;but ah! I fear his di&s;plea&s;ure, added to the bitter pangs of poverty, were the &s;ad means of her di&s;&s;olution&mdash; &s;he died, my friend, of a broken heart!&mdash;my Euphe|mia is no more! My father was informed of this, and I thought, the unhappy cau&s;e of our di&s;union being removed, that all his re&s;entment would have died likewi&s;e; but herein I deceived my&s;elf&mdash;his anger lives &s;till, and &s;eems likely, I think, to remain for ever&mdash;he has &s;ub&s;tituted in my place a youth, who&s;e manners and ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">racter indeed entitle him to every one's love&mdash;though my enemy, I look upon
<PB N="177" REF="032623_0176_0FF3F31E47E5B2B0">
him as my friend&mdash;though the adoption is &s;omewhat unnatural, I e&s;teem him as a real brother&mdash;he is to enjoy the inheritance which is my right&mdash;with all my heart&mdash;be it &s;o; and long may he be happy there|with."</P>
<P>Wilmot was exceedingly moved with this &s;hort hi&s;tory; he railed bitterly again&s;t the unknown father's cruelty, and cur&s;ed the youth that could retain &s;o unju&s;tly what was another's legal right and due&mdash;</P>
<P>But Henry interrupted him, while thus railing again&s;t him&s;elf&mdash;</P>
<P>"Forbear; you know not who you abu&s;e; I have a &s;tratagem in my head, that I hope will baffle all the vindictive de&s;igns of my cruel father&mdash;Yes, I hope to puni&s;h his unkindne&s;s, by means of the puni&s;hment he intends for me."</P>
<P>Wilmot pre&s;&s;ed him to be more explicit; he prayed earne&s;tly that he would confide in him, pro|mi&s;ing not only profound &s;ecrecy, but even his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in any &s;cheme that was honorable and likely to &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>Henry thanked the youth for his generous offer&mdash; a&s;&s;ured him that his a&s;&s;i&s;tance was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;a|ry, and one day or other he would communicate his intentions&mdash;at pre&s;ent his de&s;igns were not &s;uffi|ciently ripe for execution, and therefore it was un|nece&s;&s;ary, he &s;aid, to mention them.</P>
<P>"I cannot," continued Henry, "forbear to re|mark the contradictory pa&s;&s;ions of my father: he &s;ees faults in me, which, though glaring in his newly adopted &s;on, he is mo&s;t ob&s;tinately blind to: the very crime which I have committed, my brother (give me leave &s;o to call him) has his permi&s;&s;ion for doing: he is in love with a young girl who is equally as poor as my dear Euphemia was&mdash;her birth and parentage equally ob&s;cure and mean; yet, wonderful to tell, the old gentleman has not only con&s;ented, but ab&s;olutely encourages this unequal union.
<PB N="178" REF="032623_0177_0FF3F31FCF178680">
However, when they are married, I &s;hall take the liberty of making the compari&s;on, and inquiring wherein I am more to be cen&s;ured than my repre|&s;entative; but, perhaps, I may be told that I mar|ried without leave, and he had permi&s;&s;ion; but why had not I the &s;ame indulgence, or he the &s;ame re|fu&s;al, that his &s;uperior duty and filial piety might have been proved?&mdash;"</P>
<P>"The remarks are ju&s;t," an&s;wered Wilmot&mdash; "Oh! Henry had you been ble&s;t with a father like Sir Jeffery, how different had been your lot! (Henry &s;miled.) "I experience (continued the youth) his &s;uperlative goodne&s;s every day; &s;ince &s;o kind to me, what mu&s;t he have been to his <HI>own</HI> &s;on, had he lived?"&mdash;For Wilmot was led to &s;uppo&s;e that Sir Jeffery's &s;on was dead."</P>
<P>"I am happy," replied Henry, "that my friend enjoys &s;o much uninterrupted bli&s;s."</P>
<P>The youth now extravagantly expatiated upon the baronet's act of genero&s;ity, particularly as he had indulged him in his love for Matilda, in prai&s;e of who&s;e merit he was equally lavi&s;h; he told Henry, that a me&s;&s;enger was to be immediatly di&s;patched to the old lady, with whom his dear Matilda lived, to inform her of the ardour of his love, and his wi&s;h to call her his wife; "this (added he) is al&s;o to be urged by the &s;olicitations of Sir Jeffery, who has nobly promi&s;ed, on the day of marriage, to make a comfortable &s;ettlement, exclu&s;ive of what he means to give me, on the dear object of my wi&s;hes."</P>
<P>Henry &s;uppre&s;&s;ed a &s;igh at this relation; and after mutual promi&s;es of &s;erving each other, the friends now parted.</P>
<P>The me&s;&s;enger, who was di&s;patched to the cottage where Matilda lived, was a young man, who had been &s;ome years in the &s;ervice of Sir Jeffery&mdash;his name was Spruce&mdash;both vain and illiterate; but being a great lover of intrigue, and often concerned in affairs of love, he was con&s;equently deemed the mo&s;t proper for this bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="032623_0178_0FF3F32204FCA450">On his arrival at the cottage, Matilda was ju&s;t gone to take her u&s;ual walk in the meadows. Spruce therefore imparted the motives of his vi&s;it to the old lady. Dorothy was exceedingly hurt at this &s;udden declaration of Wilmot's love, and the propo|&s;als which were made by Sir Jeffery. As Dorothy was a maiden lady, and by her own accounts fre|quently di&s;appointed in love, Spruce conceived that her aver&s;ion to this bu&s;ine&s;s naturally proceeded from that envy which women <HI>in her &s;ituation</HI> too often di&s;cover upon hearing of others, <HI>younger</HI> than them|&s;elves, advanced to the title of brides; but the&s;e were not altogether Dorothy's rea&s;ons. Intere&s;t was en|tirely her view, and as nece&s;&s;ity has no law, &s;he thought it expedient to make Spruce her friend and confidant. She therefore informed him, that if Mi&s;s was married, &s;he mu&s;t con&s;equently lo&s;e her cottage, for that this place of re&s;idence was only allowed her for the &s;ake of &s;upporting Matilda, who&s;e education had been entirely left to her.</P>
<P>Spruce was alarmed at this account, and being urged on by vanity and a&s;&s;urance re&s;olved to benefit him&s;elf by whatever &s;cheme the old lady adopted. After &s;ome little con&s;ideration and mutual &s;ugge&s;|tions, Dorothy propo&s;ed, that Mr. Spruce &s;hould entirely rever&s;e his me&s;&s;age, and in&s;tead of informing Matilda, that it was Wilmot (to whom it was well known the young lady was partial) that intended her the honor of his hand&mdash;to declare it was Sir Jeffery Wood&s;tock, the old gentleman him&s;elf, who wi&s;hed to marry her, and that Mr. Wilmot intended to accompany the Baronet, in order to &s;trengthen his &s;uppo&s;ed &s;olicitation.</P>
<P>"Sir Jeffery," the old lady remarked, "is &s;o old and infirm, that I know Matilda will be di&s;gu&s;ted with his appearance, and will ab&s;olutely give him a refu&s;al, not knowing at the &s;ame time that it is her favorite Wilmot &s;he has rejected. I will take care," cried this artful woman, "their interview &s;hall be &s;o &s;hort that no explanation &s;hall take place."</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="032623_0179_0FF3F3242A7B61A8">Spruce not only con&s;ented, but approved of this &s;cheme, on one condition, that Dorothy would u&s;e all her intere&s;t and &s;way over Matilda to recommend <HI>his</HI> beautiful per&s;on; for this vain up&s;tart entertained a pa&s;&s;ion for the Maid of the Village, and infamou&s;ly meditated her ruin.</P>
<P>The old infamous woman too readily agreed to Spruce's de&s;ign. Promi&s;es were therefore exchang|ed, and the plot now put into execution.</P>
<P>When Matilda returned from the meadows, the old lady and Spruce began to deceive her. The poor girl was &s;urpri&s;ed to hear that Sir Jeffery &s;hould think of her; but exceedingly grieved that Wilmot, her beloved, &s;hould become an advocate for &s;o di&s;|agreeable an union. Spruce a&s;&s;ured her, that it would be a thou&s;and pities her beauty &s;hould be &s;acrificed to the embraces of an old fellow, old enough to be her grandfather; and that he would exert all in his power, to relieve her embarra&s;&s;ments. Dorothy advi&s;ed her by all means to di&s;mi&s;s them before they began to argue the matter; "D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n't li&s;ten to them," cried &s;he, "don't li&s;ten to any of their propo&s;als."</P>
<P>Sir Jeffery Wood&s;tock and Wilmot now arrived, while the trembling Matilda, to the great a&s;toni&s;h|ment of the latter, endeavoured to avoid them.</P>
<P>Sir Jeffery in&s;i&s;ted on her &s;tay, hoping that the bu&s;ine&s;s which his &s;ervant had orders to communi|cate was perfectly agreeable.</P>
<P>"You do me honor," cried the gentle maid; "but con&s;ider, Sir, that I am poor and unknown&mdash;my circum&s;tances render me totally unworthy."</P>
<P>"But, my dear," replied the urgent baronet, who now &s;queezed her hand, "what &s;ignifies your being poor&mdash;I have enough, and will make an hand|&s;ome-provi&s;ion for you; with your leave, then, a lawyer &s;hall draw up the &s;ettlement."</P>
<P>"Excu&s;e me, Sir"&mdash;Matilda now withdrew her hand, while &s;orrow prevented further utterance.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="032623_0180_0FF3F325B291D8B8">"O, Matilda!" exclaimed the agitated Wilmot; "and is it po&s;&s;ible you can be &s;o unkind? Look&mdash; look on me&mdash;and if I have any influence, which once I flattered my&s;elf I had, let me prevail upon you, at lea&s;t, to con&s;ider before you ab&s;olutely refu&s;e."</P>
<P>Matilda, &s;truck with a&s;toni&s;hment to find Wilmot &s;o warm an advocate, as &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed, for Sir Jeffery Wood&s;tock, now turned about and took a faint view of Wilmot, as her tears had almo&s;t eclip&s;ed him.</P>
<P>"Good heavens!" &s;he exclaimed, is it po&s;&s;ible, Mr. Wilmot, that you can bid me look on <HI>you</HI> and con&s;ider upon <HI>this</HI> propo&s;al?"</P>
<P>"I am &s;orry," rejoined the mi&s;under&s;tood lover, "I am &s;orry to find that I am &s;o very de&s;picable in your eyes."</P>
<P>"<HI>You</HI> de&s;picable! &mdash; how can you &s;ay &s;o?"</P>
<P>"Is it not evident by your abhorrence <HI>now?</HI>"</P>
<P>Sir Jeffery was rather provoked at this &s;eeming indifference to Wilmot.</P>
<P>"What," cried he, "can be the cau&s;e of objec|tion? Do you, ill-natured fair one, de&s;ire a man <HI>younger?</HI> Or is it one of the fops of the age who can plea&s;e you better?"</P>
<P>This &s;evere reproach was deeply felt by the afflic|ted Matilda, who, making no an&s;wer, immediately left their pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>Sir Jeffery was exceedingly chagrined at this re|ception&mdash;he knew not what to think. Being enrap|tured him&s;elf with the beauty of Matilda, he was almo&s;t as eager for this match as even the fond lover; but her behaviour he deemed in&s;upportable Some|times he was for per&s;uading Wilmot to forget her&mdash; then imagining that his &s;on had, by &s;ome artful pro|ject, occa&s;ioned this her aver&s;ion, he appeared the more eager for the wedding. At la&s;t it was ultimate|ly re&s;olved, that Wilmot &s;hould &s;till remain, and, by watching her clo&s;ely, &s;eize a private opportunity of urging his reque&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="032623_0181_0FF3F327E3E97B40">In the mean time, Spruce and Dorothy were putt|ing their heads together. They rejoiced beyond mea&s;ure, that &s;o far their &s;cheme had happily &s;uc|ceeded; and now they began to con&s;ider among them&s;elves, how they &s;hould di&s;mi&s;s Sir Jeffery entirely.</P>
<P>It was immediately conjectured by Spruce, as the &s;ure&s;t means of effecting their wi&s;hes, that he &s;hould meet Matilda, and inform her a dangerous de&s;ign was in agitation again&s;t her; then to prevail upon her to make her e&s;cape with <HI>him</HI>; and when he had conveyed her &s;ome di&s;tance from the village, put in force all the power of his intreaties, and make him|&s;elf ma&s;ter of his wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>This horrid &s;cheme was greatly applauded by the infamous Dorothy, who immediately urged him to put it into execution.</P>
<P>Matilda was now alone in the meadows, bewailing her unhappy fate, and railing at the &s;uppo&s;ed infi|delity of Wilmot. Spruce &s;eized this opportunity to effect his mo&s;t horrid intention. He addre&s;&s;ed her with pretended compa&s;&s;ion and anxiety; a&s;&s;ured her that a mo&s;t horrid plot was formed again&s;t her, and that it was his wi&s;h to pre&s;erve her from violence.</P>
<P>The maid, no doubt, was alarmed at this infor|mation, and gratefully thanked Mr. Spruce for the pains he had taken. She timidly inquired what was the plot, and by what means it was po&s;&s;ible for her to e&s;cape.</P>
<P>"You mu&s;t know, Madam," cried the artful Spruce, "that my cruel ma&s;ter, Sir Jeffery, perceiv|ing that you were adver&s;e to his propo&s;al, has &s;ince con&s;ulted with Mr. Wilmot, and it has been agreed among them, that my young ma&s;ter &s;hould &s;tay here and watch an opportunity, when by fine &s;peeches he might cajole and amu&s;e you; and then, under pretence of making love to you him&s;elf, per&s;uade you to accompany him in a carriage, when his vil|l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">inous intention was to deliver you up to the power of Sir Jeffery.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="032623_0182_0FF3F32A2A93F6A0">"O heavens! is it po&s;&s;ible?" exclaimed Matilda, "that Mr. Wilmot, who has often prote&s;ted at my feet that he loved and adored but only me, &s;hould now ungenerou&s;ly forget all his vows, and u&s;e &s;uch clande&s;tine&mdash;&s;uch ba&s;e unworthy means of &s;acrifi|cing and delivering me up to a man I can never love?&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Yes, madam, a man, as I &s;aid before, that might be your grandfather&mdash;a decrepid old fellow, who would fain monopolize all your beauty to him&s;elf; but it &s;hall not be&mdash;"forbid it honor, and forbid it love;" no, I am re&s;olved to protect and deliver you &mdash;yes, madam, command your very humble &s;ervant, who is entirely devoted to your &s;ervice."</P>
<P>"I thank you, Sir, but &s;ince Mr. Wilmot has de|ceived me, I can hardly confide in any &mdash; him that I thought &s;o generous, &s;o kind, &s;o tender, and &s;o lov|ing; but now I remember he was always expatiating upon the bounty and &s;incerity of Sir Jeffery; yet he only named him as a parent, not as a lover. Alas! I did not imagine that he was recommending him to me as an hu&s;band."</P>
<P>"O my dear, you are but little acquainted with the artifices of men; but I take pity on your inno|cence and youth&mdash;I compa&s;&s;ionate your &s;ituation. Give me leave then to convey you from a place of danger; for I am &s;ure if you remain here any longer, that misfortunes will inevitably en&s;ue; the very car|riage that is intended for your ruin, I will convert to your delivery. Depend upon my truth, I can have no other motive for the&s;e per&s;ua&s;ions but hon|or and re&s;pect. Nay, to a&s;&s;ure you of my integrity, the old lady of the hou&s;e &s;hall accompany us; for I &s;corn to act clande&s;tinely or ba&s;ely. O then, think on the danger that awaits, and &s;eize on this happy opportunity of e&s;caping."</P>
<P>Matilda gave way to credulity. Mr. Spruce's offer of taking Dorothy with him removed all &s;u&s;|picion; and yet, when &s;he recollected the prote&s;ta|tions
<PB N="184" REF="032623_0183_0FF3F32C5ECE6210">
of her Wilmot, which far exceeded all tho&s;e of Spruce, &s;he did not know whom to &s;u&s;pect, or whom to believe. At la&s;t, unwary maid, &s;he con|&s;ented; and now was willing to run into real dan|ger, by way of avoiding evil that was only imaginary.</P>
<P>The happy Spruce fell on his knees, to adore and prai&s;e her for her conde&s;cen&s;ion; but while he was harping upon the de&s;igns of Sir Jeffery and Wilmot &mdash;behold the latter, who had been li&s;tening all the while, now appeared from his place of concealment, to the utter confu&s;ion of both Spruce and his belov|ed Matilda&mdash;She, poor &s;oul, deluded by the infor|mation &s;he had received, was avoiding her only friend; for in&s;tead of loving, &s;he began almo&s;t to <HI>hate</HI> him.</P>
<P>However, the violent indignity of Wilmot, who now revenged him&s;elf on the deceitful Spruce, be|gan to operate on the mind of Matilda&mdash;there was little time needed to convince the fair how much &s;he had been mi&s;taken&mdash;the pre&s;ence of Sir Jeffery Wood&s;tock confirmed the a&s;&s;ertions of the much injured Wilmot. Matilda was, notwith&s;tanding, rejoiced to find her lover was &s;incere; and he equal|ly happy that his fair one was not unkind.</P>
<P>When Dorothy perceived that the &s;tratagem was totally baffled, &s;he deemed it the be&s;t way to keep in with the young lovers. The day was now ap|pointed, and the union of Matilda and Wilmot forthwith celebrated.</P>
<P>The day after marriage (as Matilda had reque&s;ted to remain the fir&s;t week in her village) Wilmot, on his return, from &s;traying round the meadows, was exceedingly &s;urpri&s;ed to find his wife in the arms of his friend Henry&mdash;He could hardly believe his eyes, and, that he might be the better convinced, retreat|ed for a &s;hort while&mdash;but their love, their embraces were too evident; and the violent Wilmot, unable to &s;uppre&s;s his indignation any longer, bur&s;t forth and in&s;i&s;ted upon an explanation.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="032623_0184_0FF3F32DE8753550">"O, my dear &s;on!" exclaimed Henry, "for, being now the hu&s;band of my dear daughter (I con|gratulate you by that title) come to my arms!"</P>
<P>"Good heavens! are you the father of my Matil|da&mdash;and why was this concealed?"</P>
<P>"That I may &s;urpri&s;e <HI>my</HI> obdurate father&mdash;I have, till now, &s;ecreted the birth of my dear and only child, having provided on purpo&s;e this cottage; I have encouraged your addre&s;&s;es, and I have long prayed for this union."</P>
<P>The pre&s;ence of Sir Jeffery now interrupted them &mdash;He railed bitterly at the &s;uppo&s;ed intru&s;ion of Henry; but who can paint his &s;urprize, when in|formed that it was his grand-daughter whom he had married to his &s;on&mdash;that to her he had given up the due inheritance of Henry which otherwi&s;e would have been her's&mdash;He &s;aw, he felt the ju&s;tice of hea|ven; and, &s;haking hands with Henry, grieved that he had not been as kind as he &s;hould have been to the mother of Matilda&mdash;but hoped all his unju&s;t re&s;entment would be buried in total oblivion, as from henceforth he re&s;olved to reward the faithful love of Wilmot and his wife, and be a father&mdash;to the father.</P>

<P>OLIVIA was a young lady of beauty and inde|pendence, con&s;equently &s;urrounded with a number of &s;uitors, all of whom profe&s;&s;ed the great|e&s;t regard for her, and vied with each other who
<PB N="186" REF="032623_0185_0FF3F32F6F8A78A0">
&s;hould win her&mdash;Being an orphan, and without rela|tions, her &s;ituation was indeed critical, but Olivia did not want &s;en&s;e or prudence to conduct her&s;elf.</P>
<P>She found a friend and confidant in Sally, who was de&s;cended from rather a poor, but worthy fam|ily. The &s;uperior beauty of Olivia, above all, her great fortune, gave Sally but little chance of having admirers; there was, however, a young man who paid his addre&s;&s;es to her&mdash;Sally was partial to him; indeed &s;he was &s;omewhat more happy in this re&s;pect than her friend, not being tormented by numerous &s;olicitations, and con&s;equently puzzled in making a choice. She was only courted by one&mdash;and in that one, Thomas, &s;he flattered her&s;elf &s;he would find a &s;incere lover.</P>
<P>Not &s;o with Olivia&mdash;&s;he deemed it expedient to change her &s;ituation, but was exceedingly embar|ra&s;&s;ed about making her choice&mdash;the croud was &s;o great&mdash;their prote&s;tations alike &s;o &s;trong&mdash;their families all noble; that it was hard to know whom to prefer. One di&s;played great notions of honor&mdash; another of bravery. In &s;hort, &s;he di&s;covered in each &s;ome recommendation, &s;ome imperfection, and wanted a coun&s;ellor to direct her.</P>
<P>Sally having, by &s;ome means or other, heard of two cunning men, advi&s;ed her friend to &s;ubmit the ca&s;e to their &s;uperior knowledge. One of them, cries &s;he, I under&s;tand is both deaf and dumb, con|&s;equently he can <HI>tell no lies</HI>; the other is a &s;ort of interpreter, who explains every thing that his bro|ther conjurer <HI>does not &s;ay</HI>; their penetration, I hear, is very profound &mdash; they know all the future as well as I know the pa&s;t; and can read the characters of men with as much ea&s;e as I can &s;ay my prayers.</P>
<P>Olivia, by this de&s;cription of the cunning men, was very much induced to &s;ee them. Sally rejoiced exceedingly, for &s;he al&s;o intended to be convinced of her Thomas's fidelity.</P>
<P>Then, Madam, to tell the truth, exclaims Sally, I
<PB N="187" REF="032623_0186_0FF3F331A5FE8C18">
have appointed the&s;e men to call in the evening; we mu&s;t darken the room, as darkne&s;s I under&s;tand, in a great mea&s;ure, a&s;&s;i&s;ts all the conjurations, and if they don't tell us truth, it is agreed that they &s;hall have no reward.</P>
<P>Olivia was highly delighted with this appoint|ment; the &s;ervants were ordered to deny her to every gentleman that called, that &s;he might be in|&s;tructed by the&s;e cunning men, whom &s;he &s;hould encourage. Curious to know, however, the means whereby Sally became acquainted with their &s;kill, &s;he reque&s;ted to know who it was recommended them. Her friend, without re&s;erve, a&s;&s;ured her that it was the &s;ervant maid who had given this information; &s;he would (continued Sally) have communicated the matter to you her&s;elf, but was unwilling that her mi&s;tre&s;s &s;hould think her officious and impertinent &mdash;I therefore took it upon me to give permi&s;&s;ion for their admittance, re&s;olving, if you were &s;crupu|lous of trying their abilities, to &s;ummon courage &s;ufficient to &s;ee them alone.</P>
<P>Polly, according to orders, denied her mi&s;tre&s;s to every lover that called, and in the evening, about the appointed time, announced the arrival of the two cunning men.</P>
<P>The ladies received the&s;e learned gentlemen with great dread and perturbation&mdash; Sally looking now and then about her to &s;ee if the third gentleman in black, old Nick, was vi&s;ible. The deaf and dumb conjurer made &s;igns that the door &s;hould be locked; this, his interpreter immediately complied with.</P>
<P>Olivia now addre&s;&s;ing the man that could <HI>hear,</HI> begged to know who among all her admirers loved her be&s;t &mdash; the conjurer bowed, and making &s;igns to his comrade, ob&s;erved to Olivia, that his brother fir&s;t of all intended to inform her the characters of tho&s;e pretended admirers whom &s;he &s;aw ye&s;terday &mdash; "he will &s;hew you by his book of knowledge, their names and di&s;po&s;ition."</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="032623_0187_0FF3F3347B260760">This wonderful promi&s;e excited the curio&s;ity of both the ladies, upon which the cunning men be|gan their <HI>pantomimical</HI> di&s;cour&s;e&mdash;the deaf and dumb one, by &s;igns, now repre&s;ented a fop, and his inter|preter opening the book, declared his name to be Lord Foppington.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe Olivia's a&s;toni&s;hment; as for Sally, &s;he remained with fixed eyes and open mouth, rivetted, as it were, to the ground. He next repre&s;ented a game&s;ter; who the interpreter called Mr. Hazard; by &s;taggering and hiccuping, he al&s;o expre&s;&s;ed a toper, Carele&s;s was his name; Gripe, a mi&s;er, followed&mdash;and '&s;quire Crop, a hunt&s;man, concluded the account.</P>
<P>The credulous fair ones were now &s;ufficiently a&s;&s;ured of the wonderful &s;kill of the&s;e men; accord|ingly they reque&s;ted a further account of their char|acters, as Olivia wi&s;hed to know if any were de&s;erving of her hand.</P>
<P>When the interpreter communicated their wi&s;h to his comrade, he took pen and ink, and wrote the following advice to Olivia, in re&s;pect to Lord Foppington.</P>
<Q><L>Remain as plain as bounteous nature made you,</L>
<L>Nor thro' ambition &s;eek to be a lady;</L>
<L>Abhor Lord Foppington, who&s;e chief de&s;ire</L>
<L>Is, leading fa&s;hions for your fools t' admire;</L>
<L>To &s;trut about in gold and &s;ilver lace,</L>
<L>And charm the fair ones with his pretty face.</L>
<L>Mark on the little finger, his fine ring,</L>
<L>To &s;hew how in&s;ignificant&mdash;the <HI>thing!</HI></L>
<L>Mark how in matters, either right or wrong,</L>
<L>His empty <HI>honor</HI> flies upon his tongue&mdash;</L>
<L>For ever flying, as, within his brea&s;t,</L>
<L>Honor can find no place wherein to <HI>re&s;t.</HI></L>
<L>How oft he gives, how oft forgets his word,</L>
<L>How oft will &s;wear, and &s;wearing &s;hew the <HI>lord,</HI></L>
<L>I know to love thee, he did late prote&s;t&mdash;</L>
<L><PB N="189" REF="032623_0188_0FF3F336AA31B260">But marry, and he'll &s;ay 'twas <HI>all a je&s;t.</HI></L>
<L>Oh! then beware, for nought will be your gains,</L>
<L>What is a powder'd head that lacketh brains?</L></Q>
<P>Olivia was exceedingly grateful for this informa|tion&mdash;&s;he determined on di&s;mi&s;&s;ing his lord&s;hip im|mediately, and era&s;ing him for ever out of the li&s;t of her admirers. The conjurer now, on being again importuned, wrote the following character of Mr. Hazard&mdash;
<Q><L>Avoid this man, nor take him to your arms,</L>
<L>You &s;acrifice your gold, as well as charms.</L>
<L>Tho' great as Dives&mdash;yet to-morrow night,</L>
<L>He may be Lazarus in di&s;mal plight;</L>
<L>And is't not even better to be poor,</L>
<L>Than wealth by horrid methods to procure&mdash;</L>
<L>To rob whole families&mdash;to leave forlorn</L>
<L>Wife, hu&s;band, children, perhaps too th' unborn.</L>
<L>But mark the gen'ral end of men like the&s;e,</L>
<L>When con&s;cience and remor&s;e their bo&s;oms &s;eize;</L>
<L>When wild di&s;traction entering the place,</L>
<L>Now want and ruin &s;tare him in the face.</L>
<L>Should he behold a wife of all bereft,</L>
<L>His little ones, whom he has naked left,</L>
<L>How often &s;uicide holds up the knife,</L>
<L>And frenzy prompts him to attack his life;</L>
<L>Then with a coward's arm, he gives the blow,</L>
<L>And flies to other ills he did not know!</L></Q></P>
<P>This was &s;ufficient&mdash;Convinced of the danger of marrying &s;uch a man, Olivia immediately renounced him. Now Carele&s;s was pourtrayed, and the young lady thus cautioned&mdash;
<Q><L>This character, a ba&s;e incon&s;tant proves,</L>
<L>For he's another mi&s;tre&s;s whom he loves.</L>
<L>His bottle&mdash;whom, with Bacchanalian roars,</L>
<L><PB N="190" REF="032623_0189_0FF3F33831942B50">He plainly &s;hews that he alone adores;</L>
<L>What, tho' you're wonderfully fair he vows,</L>
<L>Still greater charms he to his wine allows.</L>
<L>And tho' your eyes for brightne&s;s may &s;urpa&s;s,</L>
<L>He &s;ees more &s;parkling beauties in his gla&s;s;</L>
<L>What, tho' he &s;wears to be for ever true,</L>
<L>His bottle he would ne'er for&s;ake for you;</L>
<L>And &s;ay, what plea&s;ure could you ever ta&s;te</L>
<L>With one who, tho' a man, is oft a <HI>lea&s;t,</HI></L>
<L>Who turns his night to day, and day to night,</L>
<L>And, '&s;tead of plea&s;ing, is more apt t' affright?</L></Q></P>
<P>Well, cried Olivia, he may marry his bottle for me&mdash;I'll have none of him.</P>
<P>The cunning men now proceeded, and in a few minutes produced the following lines upon Gripe&mdash;
<Q><L>The mi&s;er view, who&s;e greedy itching palm</L>
<L>Squeezes a pur&s;e, as beggars would an alm;</L>
<L>So very fond of empty glitt'ring pelf,</L>
<L>Could he love you who does not love him&s;elf?</L>
<L>Beware of him, he never could be true,</L>
<L>He loves your money, but he loves not you;</L>
<L>And tho' you brought him thou&s;and bags of &s;tore,</L>
<L>Still would he want, &s;till would he covet more.</L>
<L>Be&s;ides, he's wrinkled, old, then think and &s;ay,</L>
<L>Shou'd <HI>January</HI> e'er be join'd with <HI>May?</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>This old gentleman was accordingly &s;truck out of the li&s;t of Olivia's pretended admirers. Sally all this while appeared exceedingly mortified and di&s;|plea&s;ed; &s;he felt for her friend&mdash;apprehen&s;ive that, notwith&s;tanding the number of her boa&s;ting lovers, &s;he could not find one that was worthy and &s;incere.</P>
<P>The next character which appeared in writing was the '&s;quire's. Thus it follows, with the cunning man's advice&mdash;
<Q><L>Oh, &s;corn this fellow's nothingne&s;s and art,</L>
<L><PB N="191" REF="032623_0190_0FF3F33A621F4290">He has a tongue, but wants a feeling heart;</L>
<L>No real plea&s;ure does this man pur&s;ue,</L>
<L>For only game and riot are his view.</L>
<L>Were you this worthle&s;s creature to embrace,</L>
<L>He'd ri&s;k you on a wager the next race;</L>
<L>Nor would it &s;eem to tho&s;e, that knew him, &s;trange,</L>
<L>If for a dog or hor&s;e his wife he'd change.</L></Q></P>
<P>The cunning men's advice was accepted, and '&s;quire Crop accordingly rejected.</P>
<P>"Lord, Lord," cried Sally, who&s;e patience was now quite exhau&s;ted, "pa&s;s over all tho&s;e unworthy beings, and let my friend know who is mo&s;t de&s;erv|ing of her hand; then, Sir, I &s;hall trouble you to tell me whether Mr. Thomas is, or is not worthy of his Sally."</P>
<P>The interpreter then reque&s;ted his comrade to &s;atisfy the wi&s;hes of the young ladies; accordingly, he gave Olivia the following paper&mdash;
<Q><L>'Tis hone&s;t Love well who adores alone,</L>
<L>Which mode&s;ty prevents the youth to own;</L>
<L>He loves you more than fops love dre&s;&s;es fine,</L>
<L>Game&s;ters, good luck, or topers their good wine.</L>
<L>Oh yes, believe me, fair, he loves you more</L>
<L>Than jockeys, game; or mi&s;ers, bags of &s;tore;</L>
<L>Oh, then reward this lover that's &s;o true,</L>
<L>And &s;mile on him that thinks of nought but you.</L></Q></P>
<P>Lovewell!&mdash;Olivia was amazed; and no wonder, for &s;he was never importuned by the youth, nor (though &s;he confe&s;&s;ed &s;he felt a <HI>&s;omething</HI> in her heart, which was very much in his favour) did &s;he ever &s;u&s;pect the lea&s;t partiality on his &s;ide; for this rea&s;on &s;he did not encourage a hope that might have proved both fal&s;e and fatal.</P>
<P>The interpreter now conjured her, as her future happine&s;s thereupon depended, to grant Mr. Love|well the honor of her hand. Timidity, he &s;aid, had
<PB N="192" REF="032623_0191_0FF3F33C8C755C90">
prevented him from yet making known his love, but &s;hortly &s;he &s;hould behold him at her feet, when he hoped &s;he would remember his advice.</P>
<P>Oliva declared &s;he would be mindful of his com|mands, and, &s;ince he was de&s;erving, &s;he would reward his worth.</P>
<P>"Thanks, my dear angel," exclaimed the <HI>dumb</HI> man &mdash;and throwing off his di&s;gui&s;e, behold, Love|well him&s;elf was kneeling in her pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>Olivia was both confu&s;ed and a&s;toni&s;hed, while Sally now believed the devil was in the room indeed.</P>
<P>Lovewell! is it po&s;&s;ible&mdash;and who are you? continued Sally, addre&s;&s;ing the interpreter.</P>
<P>Your faithful Thomas, he replied; and I conjure you likewi&s;e to &s;mile on him.</P>
<P>The whole bu&s;ine&s;s was now unravelled. The lovers, it &s;eems, had invented this &s;cheme, which, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Polly, the &s;ervant maid, was put into execution, to warn the fair Olivia of tho&s;e dan|gerous admirers who &s;urrounded her, and, at the &s;ame time, di&s;cover the real adoration of Lovewell. The grateful Olivia, mindful of the promi&s;e &s;he had made, gave Mr. Lovewell her hand, as a gratuity for the pains he had taken&mdash;while Sally and Thomas made it a double union.</P>
<P>This &s;trange metamorpho&s;e of the lovers created much diver&s;ion in the neighbourhood:</P>
<LG>
<L>But men and women, children, all agreed</L>
<L>Lovewell and Tom were <HI>Cunning Men</HI> indeed.</L>

<P>WILLIAM, the &s;on of an old fooli&s;h '&s;quire who had accumulated a good deal of wealth, &s;aw and admired Delia, the daughter of an eminent mer|chant, who&s;e country hou&s;e was within a few miles of his father. 'Squire Sturdy having intended to &s;end his &s;on abroad, which he hoped would turn out greatly to his advantage, was exceedingly chagrined upon finding the young man aver&s;e to his de&s;ign; for William's heart being with Delia, he could not po&s;&s;ibly think of leaving the place, and thereby giv|ing up all his hopes of future happine&s;s. Sooner than break his vows to his beloved, he was deter|mined, let what would be the con&s;equence, to refu&s;e obedience to his father's will. The old man was exceedingly provoked at this unexpected denial; for William, till now, was always willing and duti|ful; he therefore declared, if he did not obey, he &s;hould &s;ee him no more; and that he would marry again in hopes of getting another &s;on that might be better de&s;erving of his love and fortune. William with an heavy heart quitted his father's habitation; for, though di&s;agreeable and painful as it was, he had rather leave that than leave his deare&s;t Delia.</P>
<P>The 'Squire was ignorant of William's partiality for Mr. Violent's daughter: &s;ometimes, indeed, the &s;on would have di&s;clo&s;ed the &s;ecret of his heart, and
<PB N="194" REF="032623_0193_0FF3F34055ADC630">
the &s;trong motives he had for remaining at home; but then he apprehended that &s;uch candor and &s;in|cerity might only incur greater di&s;plea&s;ure, and the con&s;equences bring al&s;o &s;ome trouble upon the fair object of his adoration, who&s;e father was proud, im|petuous, and (&s;trange to tell) aver&s;e to his daugh|ter's being united to a <HI>young</HI> man; it being his wi&s;h, and indeed hope, to provide a &s;ober, wealthy, middle|aged per&s;on, who might be more a companion for <HI>him&s;elf</HI> than for the unfortunate maid.</P>
<P>William, now like the prodigal &s;on, a voluntary exile, repaired to the hou&s;e of Mr. Friendly, a young man who had been ju&s;t married; he had been both &s;chool-fellow and companion of William, and not only made &s;everal prote&s;tations of his regard, but proved it al&s;o by many tokens&mdash;A&s;&s;ured therefore of his a&s;&s;i&s;tance and good-nature, William di&s;clo&s;ed to him the unkindne&s;s of his father; he wi&s;hed to be married privately to Delia, imagining that when his love was then revealed, and it was out of the power of <HI>either</HI> father to prevent his happine&s;s, that his own would &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider the bu&s;ine&s;s, and compa&s;&s;ionate his &s;ituation. Friendly agreed with his de&s;ign, and re&s;olved, by way of expediting the bu&s;ine&s;s, to leave his ju&s;t married Lucinda, and a&s;&s;i&s;t him in whatever &s;cheme he might think fit to adopt.</P>
<P>This further proof of Friendly's urbanity received the grateful thanks of William. During their con|ver&s;ation, Mrs. Friendly went, according to invita|tion, to drink tea with a neighbour, who was a maid|en lady, her name Dor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">as; &s;he w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s noted for vent|ing ungenerous &s;lander and ba&s;e calumny&mdash;was very fond of making acquaintance with young &s;tran|gers, particularly &s;uch as were courting or lately married; and, under the ma&s;k of friend&s;hip, crea|ted unnece&s;&s;ary apprehen&s;ions and jealous fears&mdash; &s;he had been the means of &s;owing di&s;cord in many families, and &s;eparating many a couple, who, other|wi&s;e, would have enjoyed the greate&s;t happine&s;s to|gether
<PB N="195" REF="032623_0194_0FF3F3428A7D5168">
&mdash;Such was the character of this worthle&s;s female, too many of whom are daily permitted to murder reputations by their table-talk, and wound the peace of individuals by continual &s;lander.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, Lucinda encouraged the vi&s;its of this dangerous woman, and not only returned them, but credulou&s;ly made her both a friend &amp; coun&s;ellor. She now imparted to her the unexpected vi&s;it of William, for whom her hu&s;band, &s;he &s;aid, had pro|fe&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t e&s;teem, and on who&s;e account Friendly had intimated to her, that he &s;hould be obliged to leave her for two or three days.</P>
<P>Dorcas &s;hook her head at this information&mdash; "Friend&s;hip (&s;aid &s;he) never induced a man yet to leave his wife, for even an hour, if he loved her&mdash; particularly during the honey-moon&mdash;I am &s;orry to hear this&mdash;I thought Mr. Friendly quite a different &s;ort of a man&mdash;but there is no dependence upon any of them, that's the truth of it."</P>
<P>The&s;e mi&s;tru&s;tful hints awakened the curio&s;ity of Lucinda, who conjured her, by the e&s;teem &s;he had profe&s;&s;ed for her, to acquaint her candidly with her real opinion of the matter.</P>
<P>"Excu&s;e me, my dear, I &s;hould be exceedingly unwilling to alarm you&mdash;Heaven forbid that I &s;hould make you unea&s;y&mdash;No, no."</P>
<P>The&s;e words only rendered the un&s;u&s;pecting Lu|cinda the more eager and impatient &mdash; At la&s;t the old lady <HI>frankly</HI> declared (as &s;he termed it) that her hu&s;|band was fal&s;e, and this vi&s;it was contrived between him and his friend, that he might have an opportu|nity of &s;eeing and dallying with another fair, more charming in his eyes.</P>
<P>Lucinda at fir&s;t &s;miled at the&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions; but the infamous Dorcas, to prove her great penetration and wi&s;dom, now added &s;o many lies to her &s;u&s;pi|cions, that jealou&s;y &s;oon began to prey upon the mind of Mrs. Friendly.</P>
<P>During this, William had projected a &s;cheme of
<PB N="196" REF="032623_0195_0FF3F344B95523A8">
eloping with his beloved Delia, which was highly approved by his friend. Being unknown, he &s;aid, to Mr. Violent, he thought he might ea&s;ily di&s;gui&s;e him&s;elf as a reaper, this being the &s;ea&s;on for cutting down hay, and there being a &s;carcity of workman, indeed &s;o much, that the old gentleman had very fortunately the preceding day applied to Mr. Friend|ly (whom he knew) to look out for a few hands for him. A di&s;gui&s;e was &s;oon had, and two real reapers, who were let into the &s;ecret, and well bribed, were to accompany him. Friendly was now to go and recommend them per&s;onally to Mr. Violent. As his wife had not yet returned from her neighbour's, and delay he feared would be dangerous, he left a letter for her with the &s;ervants, informing her that he &s;hould be &s;oon home, but was obliged to go im|mediately to fulfil the duties of friend&s;hip. This being written, and William properly attired, away they went to the old gentleman's country &s;eat.</P>
<P>Mrs. Friendly, on her return, mi&s;&s;ing her hu&s;band, was now convinced of what before &s;he fal&s;ely &s;u&s;|pected; the letter (for it was written in a hurry) being brief and un&s;atisfactory, helped to add to her unea&s;ine&s;s. She was told by the &s;ervants, that young Mr. Sturdy and their ma&s;ter were for a long time clo&s;etted with two reapers&mdash;There was a &s;cheme evidently in agitation, and this &s;cheme not being divulged to Lucinda, confirmed now all her &s;u&s;picions, and corroborated, &s;eemingly, all the a&s;&s;ertions of her neighbour.</P>
<P>Mrs. Friendly &s;earched the clo&s;et where they had been together, and, &s;eeing the clothes of William, which he had le&s;t, in con&s;equence of putting on tho&s;e of a reaper&mdash;a thought &s;truck her&mdash;William being rather a &s;lender made man, and &s;omewhat &s;hort, &s;he immediately tried his coat <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n her; in fact, his clothes &s;itted her &s;o well, that &s;he now ap|peared a young man, and away &s;he &s;et off to Mr. Violent's, to di&s;cover the real intentions of her hu&s;band.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="032623_0196_0FF3F34647AE8D80">Mr. Violent had ju&s;t hired William and the other two men, on the recommendation of Mr. Friendly, with whom he &s;hook hands, and &s;eemed very happy at &s;eeing them.</P>
<P>"You are come, (cried he) at a very right time, boy, to celebrate my daughter's nuptials."</P>
<P>"Your daughter's," echoed the a&s;toni&s;hed Friendly&mdash;"Pray, Sir, may I inquire who is to be the happy man?"</P>
<P>"Aye, I know you would be &s;urpri&s;ed&mdash;Faith, the matter is &s;omewhat &s;udden, I confe&s;s; but that's my way&mdash;I do things at once&mdash;You mu&s;t know, Sir, I happened to be in company ye&s;terday with an elderly gentleman (for &s;uch has been always my fixed determination to make a &s;on-in-law) and very luck|ily, Sir, this gentleman wanted a wife; for he had a wild unthinking youth of a &s;on, who has thwarted his inclinations, and upon being rebuked, the per|ver&s;e boy has left him. Mr. Sturdy is con&s;equently provoked to marry, and this day is appointed for the wedding"</P>
<P>"But, Sir, is not this bu&s;ine&s;s too &s;udden? Do you think, Mr. Sturdy can love the young lady &s;uf|ficiently to render him worthy of her hand? Be&s;ides, are you &s;ure the match is perfectly agreeable to your daughter?"</P>
<P>The old man ridiculed all the&s;e idle notions, as he called them&mdash;he confe&s;&s;ed, indeed, that his daugh|ter, upon b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing appri&s;ed of his determination, faint|ed; but he did not care for that&mdash;he had now lock|ed her up, and till &s;he was the wife of Mr. Sturdy, not a moment's liberty would he allow her.</P>
<P>Friendly was exceedingly hurt at this informa|tion, and under pretence of giving orders to the workmen he had brought, ha&s;tened immediately to his friend, and communicated the dreadful re&s;olu|tions which were now in agitation.</P>
<P>William was equally &s;urpri&s;ed to hear that his fa|ther was his rival, and it being dangerous to lo&s;e

time, re&s;olved, by &s;ome means or other, to convey a letter to his dear Delia, and acquaint her what mea|&s;ures he was about taking for her &s;peedy delivery. As his &s;ituation gave him many opportunities of conver&s;ing with the &s;ervants, he di&s;covered that Ralph had frequent acce&s;s to his young mi&s;tre&s;s, in order to bring her nece&s;&s;ary refre&s;hments. William therefore &s;eized a convenient time of &s;peaking to Ralph, and &s;eeing him pa&s;&s;ing the meadows in a great hurry, inquired the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>"I have got," &s;ays he, "a letter for my ma&s;ter, from Mr. Sturdy&mdash;he is coming anon&mdash;and the wed|ding cloaths for my young mi&s;tre&s;s&mdash;I am to bring them to her."</P>
<P>This was &s;ufficient; he then reque&s;ted he would deliver her a letter, which had been left with him, for her. Ralph &s;tared&mdash;wondering how he came by it, and from whom it was. William cunningly ob&s;erv|ed, that a young fla&s;hy fellow had a&s;&s;ured him, that whoever gave it to Mi&s;s, unknown to her father, &s;hould have fifty pounds in the evening.</P>
<P>"Fifty pounds!" cried Ralph, "O dear, I'll give it to her with her cloaths."</P>
<P>"Very well then," cried William, "I &s;hall tell the gentleman who it was did him the favour; for my part, I don't like running hazards&mdash;I don't mind fifty pounds."</P>
<P>"Indeed! O, then I do&mdash;I will live no longer with Mr. Violent; he knocked me down ye&s;terday in his pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;fifty pounds will render me very comfortable&mdash;yes, yes."</P>
<P>Ralph took the letter with great plea&s;ure, expect|ing &s;oon to take the pur&s;e; but as he could not read, and fearful of making a fatal mi&s;take, on account of Mr. Sturdy's letter, which he was to give imme|diately to his ma&s;ter, he put one into the right poc|ket, and another into the left; for being thus &s;epar|ated, he could tell which is which.</P>
<P>It happened now that a neighbour's child, for
<PB N="199" REF="032623_0198_0FF3F349F5E45360">
whom he had promi&s;ed to buy a halfpenny worth of apples, met him, and demanded the boon. Ralph, mindful of the promi&s;e, gave him two; but the little boy would not be per&s;uaded that he had no more, and cunningly in&s;i&s;ted on &s;earching his pockets. Ralph, who was almo&s;t as great a <HI>child</HI> as the other, granted permi&s;&s;ion; &s;o dragging his handkerchief and letter out of his right hand pocket, and taking the other and his gloves from the left hand, he gave the little rogue the full &s;atisfaction he required, and &s;oon convinced him of their emptine&s;s.</P>
<P>Ralph put up his things again, but unfortunately, re&s;tored the letters to their wrong &s;tations; the con|&s;equence was, that, upon his ma&s;ter's appearing, and demanding what an&s;wer Mr. Sturdy had &s;ent, he gave him the letter directed for his daughter.</P>
<P>The impatient father made no &s;cruple of opening it, and, to his great a&s;toni&s;hment, made the follow|ing di&s;covery:
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>"My deare&s;t love,</SALUTE></OPENER>

I &s;hall have a coach in readine&s;s, and hope to &s;teal the key from Ralph, by making him drunk, when I &s;hall immediately lib|erate my dear Delia, and, by delivering her from cruelty and tyranny, prove my&s;elf her &s;incere and faithful lover,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>WM. STURDY."</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<P>Mr. Violent did not tarry to a&s;k any que&s;tions now, but knocking down Ralph, &s;natched the key and other letter from him, and away flew to the old gentleman whom he intended for his daughter, to acquaint him with the de&s;igns of his &s;on.</P>
<P>The loud lamentations of Ralph, who fancied that his brains were beaten out, occa&s;ioned the ap|pearance
<PB N="200" REF="032623_0199_0FF3F40E8F8C7800">
of William, for being on the watch, he was alarmed by every noi&s;e he heard; Ralph ac|quainted him in the mo&s;t doleful manner of the mi&s;take he had committed, and the ill treatment he had received. William, though inwardly grieved, pretended the greate&s;t indifference about the matter, declaring that it was his intention to throw the letter away, for he would have nothing to &s;ay to it; he would not for an hundred pounds give offence to his <HI>good</HI> ma&s;ter. This di&s;a&s;ter was &s;oon revealed to Friendly, who &s;eemed to apprehend &s;ome dreadful con&s;equences; he was happy, however, that the per&s;on of William was &s;till unknown, but feared much that the father and &s;on would meet, and a fatal di&s;covery take place; they re&s;olved, however, to keep their ground, and leave no &s;tratagem untried, which might afford &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The two old gentlemen, in the mean time, were con&s;ulting together. Old Sturdy was very much chagrined at his &s;on's pre&s;umption, imagining that William had profe&s;&s;ed this attachment to Delia, merely for the &s;ake of fru&s;trating his intentions; the old man was therefore &s;timulated the more to effect his purpo&s;e; his re&s;entment again&s;t William became greater, and his inclination to marry this young lady, &s;tronger; for fear, however, that his &s;on might baffle his de&s;ign, he re&s;olved to watch for him at a di&s;tance, and by means of two tru&s;ty men that &s;hould be di&s;gui&s;ed as con&s;tables, have him &s;ecured&mdash;as it were, fal&s;ely arre&s;ted, till the wedding was over, and all his art in vain.</P>
<P>Two men were accordingly provided, while Mr. Violent ha&s;tened home, in order to interrogate Ralph, and further &s;ecure his daughter, till he went for the chaplain.</P>
<P>It happened now that Mrs. Friendly was &s;traying about the meadow in William's clothes; &s;he had ju&s;t met Ralph, and was inquiring of him what was go|ing on; &s;he offered him &s;ome money, if he would
<PB N="201" REF="032623_0200_0FF3F34E693149C0">
introduce her to his young mi&s;tre&s;s, and was very curious, in re&s;pect to her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>Ralph, apprehen&s;ive of his ma&s;ter's approach, and being knocked down again, evaded all explanation, and refu&s;ed the money. Old Sturdy perceiving them together at a di&s;tance, and fancying it to be his &s;on, on account of the dre&s;s, for he did not &s;ee her face, gave the &s;ignal, and the men whom he ap|pointed &s;eized Mrs. Friendly, and, in &s;pite of all her re&s;i&s;tance, forced her away.</P>
<P>Old Sturdy having inquired of Ralph the purport of their di&s;cour&s;e together, was perfectly &s;atisfied that his conjectures were ju&s;t, being told that this &s;up|po&s;ed rival wanted an interview with Delia.</P>
<P>Ralph was immediately di&s;patched, to inform his ma&s;ter of the &s;ucce&s;s of this arre&s;t, and reque&s;ting him to provide the chaplain as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The poor timid &s;ervant &s;tood at a re&s;pectful di&s;|tance, while informing his impetuous ma&s;ter of all this, and being a&s;&s;ured by him, not only of forgive|ne&s;s, but likewi&s;e, a hand&s;ome gratuity, which had <HI>greater</HI> weight, he made a very candid confe&s;&s;ion, that, for the &s;ake of fifty pounds from a fine fla&s;hy gentleman, which the reaper would not accept of, he meant to deliver that letter to his young mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>"How," exclaimed Mr. Violent, "and would not the reaper accept it?"</P>
<P>"No, Sir, not double the &s;um; he &s;aid, he would not offend &s;o good a ma&s;ter."</P>
<P>The old gentleman delighted at &s;o much &s;eeming hone&s;ty, de&s;ired Ralph to go for him. William was accordingly conducted to his pre&s;ence, apprehen&s;ive of &s;ome new di&s;covery.</P>
<P>Mr. Violent expatiated much upon his integrity and honor, and told him, he intended now to make a trial of his merit, which he would accordingly reward&mdash;"I am obliged, &s;ays he, to go as far as our vicar's re&s;idence, but fearful that my daughter, dur|ing my ab&s;ence may e&s;cape, for Ralph, I find, is

treacherous and frail, I entru&s;t the key of her cham|ber to you (my hone&s;t fellow) and commi&s;&s;ion you to deliver this bundle (which contains her wedding clothes) that &s;he may be dre&s;t for the occa&s;ion."</P>
<P>William readily accepted of this valuable key, which contained &s;o great a trea&s;ure, promi&s;ing all due obedience to his ma&s;ter's commands, while, in return, the old gentleman a&s;&s;ured him of an ample compen&s;ation; and finding William not &s;o mean in education, as he &s;eemed to be in &s;ituation, he ac|quainted him with old Sturdy's re&s;olution of making his &s;on a temporary pri&s;oner, till the wedding was over&mdash;Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">liam was thunder-&s;truck to think his fath|er was capable of &s;uch mean devices.</P>
<P>"And pray, Sir," cried he, "is he looking for him now?"</P>
<P>"Poh! he has found him out."</P>
<P>"Indeed!"</P>
<P>"Aye, and he is now &s;ecure&mdash;the plot is executed &mdash;he is in the cu&s;tody of two knowing fellows, who, when they hear from us again, are to pretend great &s;orrow for their mi&s;take, and offer him a pur&s;e (which my friend has given to them on purpo&s;e, and which, he thinks, will be very acceptable to his &s;on) by the way of making it up.</P>
<P>William was now more &s;urpri&s;ed than before, wondering within him&s;elf who could be his repre&s;en|tative, but this being no time for con&s;ideration, he gave vent to other thoughts that were now of greater con&s;equence.</P>
<P>Mr. Violent rejoiced that he had &s;o cunningly deprived his daughter of all po&s;&s;ible means of &s;eeing William, or making her e&s;cape, went for the chap|lain. William &s;ought his friend, and briefly inform|ed him of the je&s;t&mdash;they flew to the place of Delia's captivity: William entered fir&s;t, while the weeping fair, expecting the approach of &s;ome hard-hearted me&s;&s;enger, or, what was &s;till more di&s;agreeable, the &s;ight of her odious intended, turned away her face&punc;
<PB N="203" REF="032623_0202_0FF3F352D86C2AB0">
but the well known voice of her beloved William, &s;oon di&s;pelled all her fears, and enlivened tho&s;e charms which de&s;pair had before deadened; joyfully &s;he accepted the hand of William, who now, by the generous a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Friendly, conveyed her far away, and was made happy by the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his fair.</P>
<P>Lucinda, however, experienced much unea&s;ine&s;s, being &s;till retained in confinement for William; &s;he had written a letter to Dorcas her <HI>good-natured</HI> friend, who ob&s;erved, in writing, that &s;he was &s;urpri&s;ed Mrs. Friendly could &s;end to her, having acted &s;uch an <HI>indecent</HI> part. Lucinda applied to another, who begg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d leave, in a polite letter, to decline the vi&s;it, as Mi&s;s Dorcas had a&s;&s;ured her &s;he ran away with &s;ome unknown man, and injured the <HI>be&s;t of hu&s;bands</HI> &mdash;her eyes were now opened, and &s;he di&s;patched a letter, being a full confe&s;&s;ion of all, to Mr. Friendly.</P>
<P>The old men, by this time, had met, and, to their great &s;orrow, di&s;covered the bird had flown.

<HEAD>The Hypochondriac, or Force of Imagination. A PLEASANT STORY.</HEAD>
<P>MR Whim&s;ical had one only child, Clarinda, who&s;e affection for her father had made her &s;olemnly vow that &s;he would never marry till he was cured of tho&s;e &s;trange and unaccountable hips, to which, &s;ince the death of her mother, he had been con&s;tantly addicted. De&s;mond had paid his addre&s;&s;es to her, but in vain; he therefore &s;olicited permi&s;&s;ion to be admitted among the number of her acquaint|ance, when he would exert all in his power to recover her unfortunate father from his capricious humours. This reque&s;t was not only readily complied with, but gratefully acknowledged as a kindne&s;s; indeed, De&s;mond's a&s;&s;iduity almo&s;t &s;ecured him the affection of Clarinda; &s;he felt a &s;trong partiality for him, on account of his tenderne&s;s to Mr. Whim&s;ical.</P>
<P>The manners of Mr. Whim&s;ical, were extremely fanta&s;tical: he has frequently fancied him&s;elf in a &s;tate of lunacy, and reque&s;ted every attendant to &s;tand at a re&s;pectful di&s;tance, for fear he might bite them. De&s;mond, who for the &s;ake of Clarinda, had undertaken his cure, re&s;olved to feed his humours, in hopes of giving him a &s;urfeit; he, therefore, put on a &s;traight wai&s;tcoat, and, by u&s;ing &s;everity, &s;oon recovered his patient from his frenzy fit&punc;</P>
<P>Mr. Whim&s;ical now imagined him&s;elf in danger of a putrid fever, and would not be per&s;uaded but that his hands had a mo&s;t offen&s;ive &s;mell. De&s;mond encouraged the idea, for he was always admitted as the phy&s;ician, and ordered him &s;uch di&s;agreeable potions, that Mr. Whim&s;ical was afterwards very willing to think him&s;elf &s;afe man.</P>
<P>Once, indeed, having di&s;covered an in&s;ect in a ba&s;on of water which he was drinking, he imagined him&s;elf full of worms; &s;o great was the force of im|agination, that he felt them, he declared, working
<PB N="205" REF="032623_0204_0FF3F3568C197920">
within; this led him, at la&s;t, to &s;uppo&s;e him&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;t, and nothing would per&s;uade him, but that he had now an evil &s;pirit tormenting him.</P>
<P>Mr. De&s;mond forced him to drink large draughts of chamomile tea, till he became &s;o weary and weak with continual exerci&s;e, as to believe him&s;elf delivered &mdash;but the young gentleman, thinking proper to puni&s;h him for tho&s;e ill-timed fancies, in order to prevent their return, in&s;i&s;ted that he was as bad as ever, and compelled him to drink more. In &s;hort, he &s;o di&s;gu&s;ted him of this &s;uppo&s;ition, that Mr. Whim&s;ical was never troubled with an <HI>evil &s;pirit</HI> again.</P>
<P>Another time, he fancied that he had lo&s;t his no&s;e, and made great lamentations for his &s;uppo&s;ed mis|fortune; but De&s;mond very &s;peedily re&s;tored this feature, by giving it &s;uch a terrible pull as made him feel that it was really there.</P>
<P>This, however, was the occa&s;ion of another ex|traordinary fancy; for he now thought his no&s;e &s;o exceedingly long, that, though his friends were &s;ev|eral yards di&s;tance, he apprehended they would hurt it. "Take care of my no&s;e," he would con|tinually cry to every per&s;on that was at arms length &mdash;"You'll hurt my no&s;e," &amp;c.</P>
<P>Tho' this &s;eemed to be no ea&s;y misfortune to re|move, yet De&s;mond, by his u&s;ual dexterity, convin|ced him of its real length, by tying an handkerchief round his face, which reduced his no&s;e to a proper &s;ize.</P>
<P>Mr. Whim&s;ical, at la&s;t, became &s;o very ridiculous, as to imagine him&s;elf inanimate&mdash;He was &s;ometimes a tea-pot, and putting one arm a-kimbo, and &s;tretch|ing another out, he &s;aid that was the <HI>handle,</HI> and this was the <HI>&s;pout,</HI> de&s;iring the &s;pectator to <HI>fill him out.</HI></P>
<P>De&s;mond, being apprized of this &s;trange notion upon entering the room, taxed the &s;ervant for leav|ing in his pre&s;ence that abominable old-fa&s;hioned tea-pot, which he had ordered to be thrown away;
<PB N="206" REF="032623_0205_0FF3F358B72A96D0">
then throwing Mr. Whim&s;ical down, the tea-pot was &s;uppo&s;ed to be broken in pieces.</P>
<P>This fall, however, was productive of another vex|atious con&s;equence, for Mr. Whim&s;ical now conceit|ed him&s;elf dead. De&s;mond was re&s;olved, however, to indulge the idea, and, by this great attempt, cure him, if po&s;&s;ible, of his &s;trange ideas.</P>
<P>He was accordingly &s;tretched out, and made wit|ne&s;s of all tho&s;e friends who came to mourn his untimely departure. According to their in&s;tructions, they abu&s;ed his memory, &s;landered his name, and provoked poor Whim&s;ical &s;o much, that he wi&s;hed he was alive again to retaliate the&s;e in&s;ults.</P>
<P>He was now left alone, as he thought, but De&s;|mond remained li&s;tening; he began fervently to pray, when an hollow voice, which proceeded from De&s;mond behind the curtain, thus an&s;wered him&mdash;</P>
<P>"If you will promi&s;e to &s;ubmit to the coun&s;el and directions of your daughter, thou &s;halt again be re|&s;tored to her, for thou art not dead, but in a trance; if, however, thou refu&s;e&s;t ob&s;tinately to be guided by her, and your friends, the con&s;equence is, that thou &s;halt be buried alive."</P>
<P>Whim&s;ical li&s;tened, but made no reply; he was therefore put into a coffin, but while they were &s;crewing him down, he roared out mo&s;t vociferou&s;ly that he was alive, and prayed them not to bury him &s;o. It was &s;ome time before they would take notice &mdash;at la&s;t, De&s;mond took him out, declaring that he was a new man, quite young and hand&s;ome, which Mr. Whim&s;ical conceiting, became &s;o exceedingly bri&s;k and merry, that every ailment was at an end.</P>
<P>Clarinda now rewarded the kind attention of De&s;|mond with her hand. Whim&s;ical danced at their wedding, and fancied him&s;elf &s;o very hale and young, that he lived, until he <HI>really died.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHARLES and MARIA. A INTERESTING TALE.</HEAD>
<P>CHARLES and Maria were the &s;on and daughter of re&s;pectable trade&s;men in London, who, early in life te&s;tified the &s;tronge&s;t marks of affection for each other, which was both di&s;covered and approved by each fond parent; it being long their mutual wi&s;h that their children &s;hould be united. When Charles attained his eighth year, he was &s;ent to a boarding &s;chool near the city; and Maria, likewi&s;e, was promi&s;ed by her father a good education, in order to render her worthy of her hu&s;band, partic|ularly the &s;on of his old friend, who&s;e fortune was far &s;uperior to his; for Good will had been much more fortunate in re&s;pect to trade than his neigh|bour. The two friends, however, were &s;o &s;trongly attached to each other, that no mean views of inter|e&s;t could po&s;&s;ibly divide their friend&s;hip; in fact, Goodwill and Frankly were, what indeed is very &s;eldom &s;een now-a-days, true and &s;incere compan|ions.</P>
<P>Goodwill, the father of Maria, had all his prop|erty &s;ecure in England, therefore no change was likely to take place; but Mr. Frankly had mo&s;t of his in merchandize abroad, and daily heard of an increa&s;e which gave him infinite plea&s;ure; for, like a prudent father, he wi&s;hed much to rai&s;e his &s;on above the frowns of humble dependence. Charles improved &s;o rapidly under the care of his preceptor, that it was now time to think for what profe&s;&s;ion he was mo&s;t &s;uitable. Mrs. Frankly was for the church, Mr. Frankly for the law, but Charles him&s;elf for the army. A red coat has charms in it &s;o irre&s;i&s;tible, that many young men put on their royal ma&s;ter's livery without po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the qualifications which it requires; however, to do our young hero ju&s;tice, he was more induced to wear it through the noble

impul&s;es of honor and courage, than vanity or arro|gance.</P>
<P>His father, always ready to comply with his wi&s;hes, purcha&s;ed a commi&s;&s;ion in the army. Few young men looked better, or did more honor to regimen|tals than our bold hero. His fir&s;t vi&s;it he paid to Maria, who thought &s;he never &s;aw him look more to advantage. This young lady was now become the admiration of all, and the idol of her parents: &s;he was generous, amiable, and unre&s;erved.

She in|vited him to &s;up with her, and, being bountiful in her wine, not only rendered him forgetful of his Maria, but ab&s;olutely provoked him, in fits of rhap|&s;ody, to make love to her; this to a lady who hap|pened to be the ca&s;t-off mi&s;tre&s;s of Lord M&mdash;, was by no means di&s;agreeable&mdash;&s;he encouraged his profe&s;&s;ions, which now became extravagant. Charles was, indeed, the fir&s;t man who had ever rai&s;ed a true flame in her brea&s;t, and &s;he was re&s;olved the bird &s;hould not readily fly away from her cage; &s;he &s;uffered him to take many liberties, and being a fine woman, Charles was by no means &s;hy.</P>

<P>Charles wrote to his mi&s;tre&s;s the next day, inclo|&s;ing her a bank-bill, which he begged her to accept in&s;tead of him&s;elf, and which, as her wi&s;hes were already gratified, and the remainder of her love ex|tingui&s;hed by the account of his marriage, was, at pre&s;ent, far more acceptable.</P>

<HEAD>MEMOIRS Of CHRISTIAN JACOBSEN DRAKENBERG.</HEAD>
<P>CHRISTIAN Jacob&s;en Drakenberg was a boat-&s;wain in the Dani&s;h army; he was born in the year 1626 (the month unknown) and died the 24th of June, 1770. Hi&s;torians have not been very par|ticular in re&s;pect to his manners or life; it appears, therefore, that this veteran was more remarkable for longevity than for any peculiarity or heroi&s;m; it is, however, acknowledged that he was exceeding|ly facetious and entertaining&mdash;his company was courted by many country gentlemen, for the &s;ake of hearing him relate &s;ome plea&s;ant &s;tories When he arrived to the age of 139, he was con&s;tantly &s;een at Denmark, where he u&s;ed to walk about, with all the vigour and &s;pirit of youth, and, by means of his plea&s;antry and good-nature, afforded great enter|tainment to the inhabitants.</P>
<P>As the early part of his youth had been &s;pent in

the Briti&s;h &s;ervice, on board the navy, in Queen Anne's wars, he was, of cour&s;e, deemed &s;uch an ex|perienced man, and &s;o capable of deciding matters of ambiguity, that, whenever any doubts aro&s;e con|cerning pa&s;t times, he was always referred to, in order to make them clear; he was generally arbi|trator in all points of difficulty, and whenever wagers were laid about the dates of any former tran&s;actions, Drakenberg was the man who was always appointed judge.</P>
<P>Even in the latter part of his life, this man was renowned for the amazing &s;trength of his faculties: he retained his memory &s;o wonderfully towards the mo&s;t advanced period of his life, that he never was known to forget <HI>his jokes,</HI> or relate a &s;tory twice to the &s;ame per&s;on. His narratives chiefly con&s;i&s;ted of the <HI>whim&s;ical</HI> and <HI>marvell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">us,</HI> it being his delight to rai&s;e a laugh, by expo&s;ing the extravagant follies of mankind, and in creating a&s;toni&s;hment and &s;ur|pri&s;e, by expatiating on all the &s;trange accidents of life; yet, to do our hero ju&s;tice, he mo&s;t honorably avoided all ba&s;e invective and per&s;onality, in every relation; nor was he ever known to wound the peace of an individual, or calumniate an hone&s;t, nay, nor a <HI>dubious</HI> character, by wanton &s;lander and vile defa|mation; his &s;tories were perfectly <HI>harmle&s;s,</HI> and, in re&s;pect to decency, &s;o inoffen&s;ive, that even ladies wi&s;hed to be his auditors.</P>
<P>Drakenberg lived exceedingly temperate&mdash;he ab|&s;tained from an exce&s;s of liquor, but now and then would take a whole&s;ome gla&s;s. Dainties he never de&s;ired, and a plain di&s;h was the utmo&s;t of his ambi|tion; this moderation was doubtle&s;s the cau&s;e of his longevity; he u&s;ed continual exerci&s;e, and pre|ferred walking to riding.</P>
<P>Towards the latter part of his life, when his ac|quaintance would &s;eem to envy the length of his days, and wi&s;h that they might &s;ee as many, he would often &s;hake his head, and make this reply&mdash;</P>

<HEAD>The Ab&s;ent Man. A TRUE AND COMIC CHARACTER.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Thoughtful, having devoted his early days to &s;tudy, became literally &s;o wrapt up with his ideas as to be frequently in&s;en&s;ible of what was &s;aid or doing. His an&s;wers have been often incohe|rent and &s;trange; his actions equally wonderful and
<PB N="213" REF="032623_0212_0FF3F3677555A408">
unaccountable. His father &s;oon repented of having left him &s;o long at college; or &s;uffered him, when young, to apply his mind ince&s;&s;antly to learning: for, that
<Q>A <HI>little</HI> knowledge is a dangerous thing,"</Q>
is the a&s;&s;ertion of a much-admired poet, who con|&s;equently exhorts all votaries to learning,
<Q>To drink deep, or ta&s;te not the Pierian &s;pring."</Q>
But here is a &s;ad proof that a man may drink <HI>too</HI> deep, or indeed <HI>&s;o</HI> deep as to intoxicate his brain, and become as &s;tupid and di&s;agreeable as one who is totally ignorant.</P>
<P>The father was now determined to provide a wife for his &s;on&mdash;in hopes that a woman might rouze him from his lethargy&mdash;might awaken him from this profound &s;tupor; and by amu&s;ing his perplex|ing thoughts, give him &s;ome life and animation.</P>
<P>The father, according to his de&s;ign, having fixed his eye upon a young lady in the neighbourhood, watched an opportunity of hinting the matter to his &s;on.</P>
<P>Young Thoughtful, who had been now &s;ent by the hou&s;ekeeper to de&s;ire to know how his father wi&s;hed the goo&s;e to be dre&s;t&mdash;appeared in a very mu&s;ing po&s;ture:</P>
<P>"I am come," &s;ays the &s;on, "to a&s;k you&mdash;" here he pau&s;ed, and began to think on what he had come about.</P>
<P>"I find," cried his father, "that I mu&s;t provide &s;omebody to &s;harpen your memory&mdash;what think you of a wife, Charles? Perhaps &s;he may quicken your recollection."</P>
<P>"A wife! A woman!"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Aye, a fine young girl."</P>
<P>"Otway, I think, was divided in <HI>his</HI> opinion;&mdash; in one of his plays he &s;ays 'We would be brutes without her;'&mdash;in another, he calls her 'the fountain

<P>"Plague on Solon, he is not <HI>my</HI> &s;on; I want to know if a wife is agreeable&mdash;now tell me immediately &mdash;what do you &s;ay? A wife is a good di&s;h, boy, for your nice appetites&mdash;you are not afraid of matrimo|ny, hey!&mdash;&s;ure it would be impo&s;&s;ible for any woman to make a goo&s;e of &s;uch a &s;ober, wi&s;e, young man."</P>
<P>"A goo&s;e&mdash;" the &s;on recollected the dinner, and begged to know how he wi&s;hed it to be dre&s;t.</P>
<P>This being foreign to the &s;ubject, provoked the father, and he an&s;wered him both peevi&s;hly and har&s;hly&mdash;"with &s;age and onions." He then re&s;umed his &s;ubject, and with &s;ome difficulty procured his acquie&s;cence. The old man was highly delighted with having &s;o far &s;ucceeded, and gave him a twenty pound bill to buy clothes for the occa&s;ion&mdash;recom|mending a &s;uit of white and &s;ilver, it being, in his opinion, the fitte&s;t to celebrate a wedding, and the mo&s;t becoming for a bridegroom.</P>
<P>"But," exclaimed the father, "how would you wi&s;h to be dre&s;&s;ed?"</P>
<P>The &s;on &s;tarted&mdash;looked fooli&s;h&mdash;coughed&mdash;and cried "eh!"</P>
<P>"How would you wi&s;h to dre&s;&s;ed?"</P>
<P>A long pau&s;e now. At la&s;t, the &s;on echoing "dre&s;&s;ed," and the father an&s;wering "yes," he replied, "Oh, father, as you do&mdash;as you do, father &mdash;<HI>with &s;age and onions.</HI>"</P>
<P>The old gentleman was exa&s;perated at this reply, and was obliged to repeat all he had &s;aid before, for the better comprehen&s;ion of his &s;on. At la&s;t, hav|ing, as he thought, recovered his recollection, he now left him in a greater labyrinth than ever.</P>
<P>When alone, the wife entered into his head, and &s;eemed to afford him &s;ome temporary plea&s;ure. He intended to go and &s;ee her. The hou&s;e-keeper met him, and begged to know how the goo&s;e was to be dre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="032623_0214_0FF3F36B2C57E5F0">"Dre&s;&s;ed, Oh, in white and, &s;ilver; that's my father's wi&s;h."</P>
<P>He now went out, but forgetting his hat, was obliged to return; then anxious to &s;ee a friend of his, who was a &s;tudent at Cambridge; he wrote a few lines&mdash;folded up the letter to put in the Po&s;t Office, but forgot to &s;eal it.&mdash;Then thinking of his mi&s;tre&s;s, he directed the letter to her, in&s;tead of his friend. Away he goes&mdash;fir&s;t directing his &s;teps to the Po&s;t Office, and when half way&mdash;turning back to &s;ee his mi&s;tre&s;s&mdash;then backwards and forwards;&mdash; once indeed he went a mile beyond his mi&s;tre&s;s's hou&s;e;&mdash;then returning in a great hurry, forgot to &s;top where &s;he lived. At la&s;t he reached the Po&s;t Office, merely by chance&mdash;the letter box reminded him of his intention; but in&s;tead of throwing in the letter, he threw in the twenty pound bill, which was to purcha&s;e him clothes; then bending his cour&s;e again to his mi&s;tre&s;s's hou&s;e, he was &s;topped by a beggar woman, who craved charity; the young man &s;topped too, and informed her it was <HI>pa&s;t two o'clock</HI>: thus he ran about, without an&s;wering any purpo&s;e, or doing the lea&s;t good.</P>
<P>By means of the father, indeed, the marriage took place; yet, the bridegroom was &s;o ab&s;ent, that he made a very <HI>mal-&agrave;-propos</HI> reply to the chaplain, du|ring the ceremony They all came home to Mr. Thoughtful's hou&s;e: the old gentleman gave up his chamber to the bride and bridegroom, but the young gentleman forgetting this, happened unfortu|nately to go to his own bed, and the poor bride was entirely for&s;aken. The father brought his ab&s;ent &s;on to a recollection of his duty; he aro&s;e and dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf; but forgetting the mo&s;t material part of his covering, made &s;uch an awkward appearance before his fair one, as &s;hocked her not a little.</P>
<P>We are not at liberty to proceed in the mi&s;takes of this ab&s;ent man. Suffice it to &s;ay, that his wife in due time recalled his recollection, and young Thoughtful became more con&s;i&s;tent.</P>

<HEAD>Singular Memoirs of PAT. O'CONNOR, An Iri&s;h Footman, during his &s;ervice with an Engli&s;h Gentleman.</HEAD>
<P>PAT. O'Connor, who never boa&s;ted of his family, as they had been all buried in ob&s;curity, hav|ing experienced the many heart-achs of being out of employ, and &s;ometimes the many belly-fulls of being in a good &s;ervice, after this round of ups and downs, at la&s;t engaged him&s;elf with an Engli&s;h gen|tleman at Cork, who was now about leaving Ireland. The thoughts of quitting the dear land of &s;aints, operated very much upon the heart of our hero, and &s;orrow becoming dry, he applied him&s;elf frequently to a good gla&s;s of whi&s;key, which &s;hortly removed his grief.</P>
<P>The day for departure came&mdash;Pat. took leave of his friends and country; while his conjectares on his new ma&s;ter engaged his pre&s;ent thoughts.</P>
<P>He &s;oon became acquainted with London, as well as the intrigues and roguery of his employer, who having been the &s;on of a late re&s;pectable citizen, thought he could never &s;pend a &s;mall &s;um that had been left him too &s;oon or too extravagantly.</P>
<P>A young lady near Wind&s;or having attracted his notice, he was re&s;olved, in his general phra&s;e, to <HI>have her,</HI> notwith&s;tanding &s;he had already te&s;tified her di&s;approbation of his addre&s;&s;es, as well as her di&s;like to his per&s;on: this, however, in&s;tead of di&s;couraging, provoked our volatile youth, to meditate a de&s;ign of ruining her; for, though his partiality for ladies was great, yet marriage &s;eldom entered his head.</P>
<P>Her uncle, with whom &s;he lived, being a &s;trange character, that received the company of every one who boa&s;ted of his parentage and lineage, he deemed it an ea&s;y ta&s;k to ingratiate him&s;elf in his favor; to accompli&s;h this, however, he dared not acknowledge him&s;elf the &s;on of a citizen, as that would totally
<PB N="217" REF="032623_0216_0FF3F36EF20C60C0">
mar his de&s;igns, and defeat his purpo&s;e with the old gentleman&mdash;He was therefore re&s;olved to dre&s;s up Pat. O'Connor in great &s;tyle, and introduce him as an Iri&s;h baronet, being his &s;uppo&s;ed uncle, whom he intended to in&s;truct, and enable to puff off his unknown family. The project delighted poor Pat. who was highly plea&s;ed with the thoughts of be|coming a gentleman. He promi&s;ed to expatiate upon the excellence of his birth, and inform this uncle of the large e&s;tate which he would give him. The day was accordingly fixed&mdash;an appointment made with Mr. Prim&s;tiff, and Pat. was introduced as a man of con&s;equence and fortune.</P>
<P>The mock hero now &s;trutted about with a&s;&s;umed &s;tate and airs&mdash;the old gentleman, on account of his &s;uppo&s;ed rank, received him with the greate&s;t cordiality, and begged to know who the young gen|tleman's father was.</P>
<P>"Why, my brother," cries Pat. "my brother, do you &s;ee&mdash;was a very good &s;ort of a gentleman, but not altogether &s;o hand&s;ome as I." "And, pray, Sir, what fortune do you intend to give your nep|hew?"</P>
<P>"What fortune&mdash;why faith and troth, honey, its hard for me to &s;ay, when I don't know the extent of it my&s;elf."</P>
<P>"Is it in lands, Sir?"</P>
<P>"Lands&mdash;O, aye&mdash;its in the <HI>Coomb</HI>&mdash;the <HI>Pottlehole</HI> &mdash;I'll give him a bit of the <HI>Liberty</HI>&mdash;a &s;crap or two of <HI>Meath-&s;treet</HI>&mdash;a few yards of <HI>Donnybrook,</HI> and&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Why, Sir, I never heard of &s;uch e&s;tates."</P>
<P>"No&mdash;then you were never in &s;weet Dublin."</P>
<P>"I have heard many expatiate upon its beauties; indeed, from the traveller's account, one may be apt to think it was the promi&s;ed land, that overflowed with milk and honey."</P>
<P>"Milk and honey!" exclaims Pat. "O, honey, O! that's a &s;ingular union indeed&mdash;why you mean <HI>milk and potatoes,</HI> you fool!"</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="032623_0217_0FF3F3707ACCAC60">The familiarity of names did not agree with the family pride of the old gentleman; of cour&s;e a quar|rel en&s;ued; Pat. &s;wearing by St. Patrick he was as good as he; and, in order to prove it, called out for his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>The &s;ound of <HI>ma&s;ter</HI> alarmed the old gentleman, but it did not in the lea&s;t confound Pat. who recol|lecting him&s;elf, put it off with&mdash;"Why, aye, did not I tell you I would make him ma&s;ter of the <HI>Coomb</HI> and <HI>Pottlehole?</HI>"</P>
<P>The ma&s;ter appeared, and as his &s;ervant was gen|erally going beyond bounds, he applied a &s;ly pinch in order to remind him of his duty&mdash;Pat. gave a &s;udden roar, and &s;wore in a terrible manner, if he did that again he would divulge all.</P>
<P>"All what?" cries the uncle.</P>
<P>"Why, what's that to you?" rejoins Pat. "Mu&s;t you know every thing, you old rogue?"</P>
<P>"Rogue!&mdash;Sir, con&s;ider my family&mdash;"</P>
<P>It was with the greate&s;t difficulty the young gen|tleman could re&s;tore peace and harmony, which at la&s;t he did, by a&s;&s;uring him that in his country, Rogue was an appellation of honor.</P>
<P>"O yes," exclaims Pat. "we gentlemen are all rogues&mdash;but &s;earch the world through, there are not more hone&s;t rogues than the &s;ons of Tipperary."</P>
<P>The la&s;t &s;cheme was to deceive the young lady&mdash; Pat. was informed that he mu&s;t per&s;onate a chaplain, in order to give a mock ceremony, that Mi&s;s might be deluded by a &s;uppo&s;ed private marriage. Our Iri&s;h hero was left alone to con&s;ider, and &s;eeing the young lady at a di&s;tance, flew to meet her, and di&s;|covered the whole de&s;ign.</P>
<P>"He wants to make a gentleman in black of me, honey, but may the black gentleman &s;eize me, if I wrong &s;o much innocence.&mdash;"</P>
<P>By this hone&s;t confe&s;&s;ion, the young lady's honor was pre&s;erved&mdash;in token of her gratitude &s;he per|&s;uaded her guardian uncle to take Pat. (who was

<P>I Labor under a &s;pecies of di&s;tre&s;s, which I fear will at length drive me utterly from that &s;ociety, in which I am mo&s;t ambitious to appear; but I will give you a &s;hort &s;ketch of my origin and pre&s;ent &s;ituation, by which you will be enabled to judge of my difficulties.</P>
<P>My father was a farmer of no great property, and with no other learning than what he had acquired at a charity-&s;chool; but my mother being dead, and I an only child, he determined to give me that ad|vantage which he fancied would have made him happy, viz. a learned education. I was &s;ent to a country grammar &s;chool, and from thence to the Univer&s;ity, with a view of qualifying for holy orders. Here, having but a &s;mall allowance from my father, and being naturally of a timid and ba&s;hful di&s;po&s;ition, I had no opportunity of rubbing off that native awkwardne&s;s, which is the fatal cau&s;e of all my unhappine&s;s, and which I begin now to fear can never be amended.

events greatly altered the po&s;ture of my affairs, viz. my father's death and the arrival of my uncle from the Indies.</P>
<P>This uncle I had very rarely heard my father mention, and it was generally believed that he was long &s;ince dead, when he arrived in England only a week too late to clo&s;e his brother's eyes. I am a&s;hamed to confe&s;s, what I believe has been often experienced by tho&s;e, who&s;e education has been bet|ter than their parents, that my poor father's ignorance, and vulgar language, had often made me blu&s;h to think I was his &s;on: and at his death I was not incon&s;olable for the lo&s;s of that, which I was not unfrequently a&s;hamed to own. My uncle was but little affected, for he had been &s;eparated from his brother more than thirty years, and in that time he had acquired a fortune which he u&s;ed to brag would make a nabob happy; in &s;hort, he had brought over with him the enormous &s;um of thirty thou&s;and pounds, and upon this he built his hopes of never-ending happine&s;s. While he was planning &s;chemes of greatne&s;s and delight, whether the change of cli|mate might affect him, or what other cau&s;e I know not, but he was &s;natched from his dreams of joy, by a &s;hort illne&s;s, of which he died, leaving me heir of all his property. And now, behold me at the age of twenty-five, well &s;tocked with Latin, Greek, and Mathematics, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an ample fortune, but &s;o awkward and unver&s;ed in every gentleman-like ac|compli&s;hment, that I am pointed at by all who &s;ee me, as the wealthy learned clown.</P>
<P>I have lately purcha&s;ed an e&s;tate in the country, which abounds in (what is called) a fa&s;hionable neighbourhood; and when you reflect on my pa|rentage and uncouth manners, you will hardly think how much my company is courted by the &s;urround|ing families, (e&s;pecially by tho&s;e who have marriage|able daughters;) from the&s;e gentlem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n I have re|ceived familiar calls, and the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing invita|tions,
<PB N="221" REF="032623_0220_0FF3F37718024168">
and though I wi&s;hed to accept of their offered friend&s;hip, I have repeatedly excu&s;ed my&s;elf under the pretence of not being quite &s;ettled; for the truth is, that when I rode or walked with full intent to return their &s;everal vi&s;its, my heart has failed me as I approached their gates, and I have frequently returned homeward, re&s;olving to try again to-morrow.</P>
<P>However, I at length determined to conquer my timidity, and three days ago accepted an invitation to dine this day with one who&s;e open, ea&s;y manner left me no room to doubt of a cordial welcome. Sir Thomas Friendly who lives about two miles di&s;|tant, is a baronet, with about two thou&s;and pounds a year e&s;tate, joining that I purcha&s;ed; he has two &s;ons and five daughters all grown up, and living with their mother and a maiden &s;i&s;ter of Sir Thomas's, at Friendly-hall, dependent on their father. Con|&s;cious of my unpoli&s;hed gait, I have for &s;ome time pa&s;t taken private le&s;&s;ons of a profe&s;&s;or, who teaches <HI>grown gentlemen to dance</HI>; and though I at fir&s;t found wonderous difficulty in the art he taught, my knowl|edge of the mathematics was of prodigious u&s;e, in teaching me the equilibrium of my body, and the due adju&s;tment of the centre of gravity to the five po&s;itions. Having now acquired the art of walking without tottering, and learned to make a bow, I boldly ventured to obey the baronet's invitation to a family dinner, not doubting but my new acquire|ments would enable me to &s;ee the ladies with tolera|ble intrepidity: but alas! how vain are all the hopes of theory, when un&s;upported by habitual practice: As I approached the hou&s;e, a dinner-bell alarmed my fears, le&s;t I had &s;poiled the dinner by want of punctuality. Impre&s;&s;ed with this idea, I blu&s;hed the deepe&s;t crim&s;on, as my name was repeat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dly announced by the &s;everal livery &s;ervants who u&s;hered me into the library, hardly knowing what or whom I &s;aw; at my fir&s;t entrance, I &s;ummoned all my for|titude, and made my new-learned bow to Lady
<PB N="222" REF="032623_0221_0FF3F37956B779B8">
Friendly: but unfortunately in bringing back my left foot to the third po&s;ition, I trod upon the gouty toe of Sir Thomas, who had followed clo&s;e at my heels, to be the nomenclator of the family. The confu&s;ion this occa&s;ioned in me is hardly to be con|ceived, &s;ince none but ba&s;hful men can judge of my di&s;tre&s;s, and of that de&s;cription, the number I be|lieve is very &s;mall. The baronet's politene&s;s by de|grees di&s;&s;ipated my concern; and I was a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee how far good breeding could enable him to &s;uppre&s;s his feelings, and to appear with perfect ca&s;e after &s;o painful an accident.</P>
<P>The cheerfulne&s;s of her lady&s;hip, and the familiar chat of the young ladies, in&s;en&s;ibly led me to throw off my re&s;erve and &s;heepi&s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;s, till at length I ven|tured to join in conver&s;ation, and even to &s;tart fre&s;h &s;ubjects. The library being richly furni&s;hed with books in elegant bindings, I conceived Sir Thomas to be a man of literature, and ventured to give my opinion concerning the &s;everal editions of the Greek cla&s;&s;ics, in which the baronet's opinion coincided with my own. To this &s;ubject I was led by ob&s;erv|ing an edition of Xenophon in &s;ixteen volumes, which (as I had never before heard of &s;uch a thing) greatly excited my curio&s;ity, and I ro&s;e up to exam|ine what it could be: Sir Thomas &s;aw what I was about, and, (as I &s;uppo&s;e) willing to &s;ave me the trouble, ro&s;e to take down the book, which made me more eager to prevent him, and ha&s;tily laying my hand on the fir&s;t volume, I pulled it forcibly; but lo! in&s;tead of books, a board which by leather and gilding had been made to look like &s;ixteen vol|umes, came tumbling down, and unluckily pitched upon a wedgwood ink&s;tand on the table under it. In vain did Sir Thomas a&s;&s;ure me there was no harm; I &s;aw the ink &s;treaming from an inlaid table on the Turkey carpet, and &s;carce knowing what I did, at|tempted to &s;top its progre&s;s with my cambrick hand|kerchief. In the height of this confu&s;ion, we were
<PB N="223" REF="032623_0222_0FF3F37BA6AC3138">
informed that dinner was &s;erved up, and I with joy perceived that the bell, which at the fir&s;t &s;o alarmed my fears, was only the half hour dinner bell.</P>
<P>In walking through the hall, and &s;uit of apart|ments to the dining room, I had time to collect my &s;cattered &s;en&s;es, and was de&s;ired to take my &s;eat be|twixt Lady Friendly and her elde&s;t daughter at the table. Since the fall of Xenophon, my face had been continually burning like a firebrand, and I was ju&s;t beginning to recover my&s;elf, and feel com|fortably cool, when an unlooked for accident, rekin|dled all my heat and blu&s;hes. Having &s;et my plate of &s;oup too near the edge of the table, in bowing to Mi&s;s Dinah, who politely complimented the pattern of my wai&s;tcoat, I tumbled the whole &s;calding con|tents into my lap In &s;pite of an immediate &s;upply of napkins to wipe the &s;urface of my clothes, my black breeches were not &s;tout enough to &s;ave me from the painful effects of this &s;udden fomentation, and for &s;ome minutes my legs and thighs &s;eemed &s;tewing in a boiling cauldron; but recollecting how Sir Thomas had di&s;gui&s;ed his torture, when I trod upon his toe, I firmly bore my pain in &s;ilence, and &s;at with my lower extremities parboiled, amid the &s;tifling giggling of the ladies and the &s;ervants.</P>
<P>I will not relate the &s;everal blunders which I made during the fir&s;t cour&s;e, or the di&s;tre&s;s occa&s;ioned by my being de&s;ired to carve a fowl, or help to various di&s;hes that &s;tood near me, &s;pilling a &s;auce-boat, and knocking down a &s;alt-&s;eller; rather let me ha&s;ten to the &s;econd cour&s;e, "where fre&s;h di&s;a&s;ters over|whelmed me quite."</P>
<P>I had a piece of rich &s;weet pudding on my fork, when Mi&s;s Loui&s;a Friendly begged to trouble me for a pigeon that &s;tood near me; in my ha&s;te, &s;carce knowing what I did, I whipped the pudding into my mouth, hot as a burning coal; it was impo&s;&s;i|ble to conceal my agony, my eyes were &s;tarting from their &s;ockets. At la&s;t, in &s;pite of &s;hame and re&s;olu|tion,
<PB N="224" REF="032623_0223_0FF3F37DDF9AB6A8">
I was obliged to drop the cau&s;e of torment on my plate. Sir Thomas and the ladies all compa&s;|&s;ionated my misfortune, and each advi&s;ed a different application; one recommended oil, another water, but all agreed that wine was be&s;t for drawing out the fire; and a gla&s;s of Sherry was brought me from the &s;ide board, which I &s;natched up with eager|ne&s;s; but O! how &s;hall I tell the &s;equel? Whether the butler by accident mi&s;took, or purpo&s;ely de&s;ign|ed to drive me mad, he gave me the &s;tronge&s;t brandy, with which I filled my mouth almo&s;t &s;tayed and bli&s;|tered; totally unu&s;ed to every kind of ardent &s;pirits, with my tongue, throat, and palate as raw as beef, what could I do? I could not &s;wallow, and clap|ping my hands upon my mouth, the cur&s;ed liquor &s;quirted through my no&s;e and fingers like a foun|tain, over all the di&s;hes; and I was cru&s;hed by bur&s;ts of laughter from all quarters. In vain did Sir Thomas reprimand the &s;ervants, and Lady Friendly chide her daughters; for the mea&s;ure of my &s;hame and their diver&s;ion was not yet complete. To re|lieve me from the intolerable &s;tate of per&s;piration which this accident had cau&s;ed, without con&s;idering what I did, I wiped my face with that ill-fated hand|kerchief which was &s;till wet from the con&s;equence of the fall of Xenophon, and covered all my features with &s;treaks of ink in every direction. The baronet him&s;elf could not &s;upport this &s;hock, but joined his lady in the general laugh, while I &s;prung from the table in de&s;pair, ru&s;hed out of the hou&s;e and ran home in an agony of confu&s;ion and di&s;grace, which the mo&s;t poignant &s;en&s;e of guilt could not have excited.</P>
<P>Thus without having deviated from the path of moral rectitude, I am &s;uffering torments like a "gob|lin damned." The half of me has been almo&s;t boiled, my tongue and mouth grill'd, and I bear the mark of Cain upon my forehead; yet the&s;e are but trifling con&s;iderations, to the everla&s;ting &s;hame

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AN eminent citizen, who had lived in good fa&s;hion and credit, was, by a train of accidents, and by an unavoidable perplexity in his affairs, re|duced to a low condition. There is a mode&s;ty u&s;u|ally attending faultle&s;s poverty, which made him rather chu&s;e to reduce his manner of living to his pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, than &s;olicit his friends, in order to &s;upport the &s;hew of an e&s;tate when the &s;ub|&s;tance was gone. His wife, who was a woman of &s;en&s;e and virtue, behaved her&s;elf on this occa&s;ion with uncommon decency, and never appeared &s;o amiable in his eyes as now. In&s;tead of upbraiding him with the ample fortune &s;he had brought, or the many great offers &s;he had refu&s;ed for his &s;ake, &s;he redoubled all the in&s;tances of her affection, while her hu&s;band was continually pouring out his heart to her in complaints that he had ruined the be&s;t woman in the world. He &s;ometimes came home at a time &s;he did not expect him, and &s;urpri&s;ed her in tears, which &s;he endeavoured to conceal, and always put on an air of cheerfulne&s;s to receive him. To le&s;&s;en their expences, their elde&s;t daughter, (whom I &s;hall call Amanda) was &s;ent into the country, to the hou&s;e of an hone&s;t farmer, who had married a &s;ervant of the family. This young woman was ap|prehen&s;ive
<PB N="226" REF="032623_0225_0FF3F3819F675650">
of the ruin which was approaching, and had privately engaged a friend in the neighbour|hood, to give her an account of what pa&s;&s;ed from time to time of her father's affairs. Amanda was in the bloom of youth and beauty, when the lord of the manor, who often called in at the farmer's hou&s;e as he followed his country &s;ports, fell pa&s;&s;ionately in love with her. He was a man of great genero&s;ity; but from a loo&s;e education, had contracted an hearty aver&s;ion to marriage. He therefore entertained a de&s;ign upon Amanda's virtue, which at pre&s;ent he thought fit to keep private. The innocent creature, who never &s;u&s;pected his intentions, was plea&s;ed with his per&s;on; and having ob&s;erved his growing pa&s;&s;ion for her, hoped, by &s;o advantageous a match, &s;he might quickly be in a capacity of &s;upporting her impoveri&s;hed relations. One day as he called to &s;ee her, he found her in tears over a letter &s;he had ju&s;t received from her friend, which gave an account that her father had lately been &s;tripped of every thing by an execution. The lover, who with &s;ome difficulty found out the cau&s;e of her grief, took this occa&s;ion to make her a propo&s;al. It is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s Amanda's confu&s;ion, when &s;he found his preten&s;ions were not honorable. She was now de|&s;erted of all her hopes, and had no power to &s;peak: but ru&s;hing from him in the utmo&s;t di&s;turbance, locked her&s;elf up in a chamber. He immediately di&s;patched a me&s;&s;enger to her father with the fol|lowing letter:
<LETTER>

I will be &s;o ingenuous as to tell you, that I do not intend marriage: but if you are wi&s;e, you will u&s;e your authority with her not to be too nice, when &s;he has

<P>This letter came into the hands of Amanda's mother; &s;he opened and read it with great &s;urpri&s;e and concern. She did not think proper to explain her&s;elf to the me&s;&s;enger; but de&s;iring him to call again the next morning, &s;he wrote to her daughter as follows:
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>"<HI>Deare&s;t Child,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Your father and I have ju&s;t now received a letter from a gentleman who pretends love to you, with a propo&s;al that in&s;ults our misfortunes, and would throw us to a lower degree of mi&s;ery than any thing which is come upon us. How could this barbarous man think, that the tendere&s;t of parents would be tempted to &s;upply their wants, by giving up the be&s;t of children to infamy and ruin? It is a mean&punc; and cruel artifice, to make this propo&s;al at a time when he thinks our nece&s;&s;ities mu&s;t compel us to any thing; but we will not eat the bread of &s;hame; and therefore we charge thee not to think of us, but to avoid the &s;nare which is laid for thy virtue. Beware of pitying us; it is not &s;o bad as you have perhaps been told. All things will yet be well, and I &s;hall write my child better news.</P>
<P>"I have been interrupted: I know not how I was moved to &s;ay things would mend. As I was going on, I was &s;tartled by a noi&s;e of one who knocked at the door, and has brought us an unexpected &s;upply of a debt which had long been owing. Oh! I will now tell thee all. It is &s;ome days I have lived almo&s;t without &s;upport, having conveyed what little money I could rai&s;e to your poor father. Thou wilt weep to think where he is; yet be a&s;&s;ured he will be &s;oon at liberty. That cruel letter would have broken his heart; but I have concealed it from him. I have

But do not think that I would thus repeat my &s;orrows to grieve thee: No, it is to intreat thee not to make them in&s;upportable, by adding what would be wor&s;e than all.

<P>The me&s;&s;enger, notwith&s;tanding he promi&s;ed to deliver this letter to Amanda, carried it fir&s;t to his ma&s;ter, who, he imagined, would be glad to have an opportunity of giving it into her hands him&s;elf. His ma&s;ter was impatient to know the &s;ucce&s;s of his propo&s;al; and therefore broke open the letter pri|vately to &s;ee the contents. He was not a little mov|ed at &s;o true a picture of virtue in di&s;tre&s;s; but, at the &s;ame time, was infinitely &s;urpri&s;ed to find his offers rejected. However, he re&s;olved not to &s;up|pre&s;s the letter, but carefully &s;ealed it up again, and carried it to <HI>Amanda.</HI> All his endeavours to &s;ee her were in vain, till &s;he was a&s;&s;ured he brought a letter from her mother. He would not part with it, but upon condition that &s;he would read it without leav|ing the room. While &s;he was peru&s;ing it, he fixed his eyes on her face with the deepe&s;t attention: her concern gave a new &s;oftne&s;s to her beauty; and when &s;he bur&s;t into tears, he could no longer refrain from bearing a part in her &s;orrow, and telling her, that he too had read the letter, and was re&s;olved to make reparation for having been the occa&s;ion of it.

<P>CALISTA was young and beautiful, ble&s;t with an uncommon &s;hare of &s;olid &s;en&s;e, enlivened by the mo&s;t &s;prightly wit. Agathocles exceeded her a very little in point of age; he was well made, brave, and prudent. He had the good fortune to be intro|duced at Cali&s;ta's, where his looks, wandering indif|ferently over a brilliant circle, &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;hed and fixed upon her: but endeavouring to recover him&s;elf from the &s;hort ec&s;ta&s;y which his fir&s;t glance produced, he immediately reproached him&s;elf as being guilty of rudene&s;s and di&s;regard to the re&s;t of the company; and this fault he endeavoured to re|pair, by looking round upon other objects. Vain

attempt! they are attracted by an irre&s;i&s;tible charm, and again turned towards Cali&s;ta. He blu&s;hed as well as &s;he, while a &s;weet emotion hitherto unfelt, played upon his heart, and di&s;concerted all his looks. They both became at the &s;ame time more timid and more curious. With plea&s;ure he gazed at Cali&s;ta, and yet could not do it without trembling: while &s;he, &s;ecretly plea&s;ed with this flattering pref|erence, looked at him by &s;tealth. They were both afraid, but e&s;pecially Cali&s;ta, of being caught by the other in the fact, and both were &s;o almo&s;t every moment. The hour of &s;eparation came, and they thought came too &s;oon. They made painful reflec|tions on the rapidity of time. Imagination, how|ever, did not &s;uffer a total &s;eparation to take place: for the image of Cali&s;ta was deeply engraven on the mind of Agathocles, and the lineaments of his per|&s;on were as &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed on that of Cali&s;ta. They both appeared le&s;s cheerful the re&s;t of the day; a lively and intere&s;ting &s;entiment, whatever it was employed their minds, which no amu&s;ement could bani&s;h. It was two days before they &s;aw each other again; and though during this interval their whole time had been filled up, either by bu&s;ine&s;s or recrea|tions, they both felt a languid anxiety which ren|dered every thing in&s;ipid, a void in their minds which we want words to define, and of which they knew not the cau&s;e; but di&s;covered it the very in&s;tant at their meeting; for the perfect contentment, the &s;oothing delight, which they ta&s;ted in the pre&s;ence of each other, would not &s;uffer them to be longer ignorant of the cau&s;e of their melancholy. Agath|ocles now collected him&s;elf, and a&s;&s;umed the courage to addre&s;s Cali&s;ta; he acco&s;ted her with the mo&s;t polite and obliging expre&s;&s;ions, and for the fir&s;t time enjoyed the happine&s;s of a particular conver&s;a|tion with her. He had hitherto &s;een only her exte|rior charms: he now di&s;covered the beauties of her mind, the integrity of her heart, the dignity of her
<PB N="231" REF="032623_0230_0FF3F38CCADC0F50">
&s;entiments, and the delicacy of her wit; but what &s;till more delighted him, was the plea&s;ing hope that &s;he did not think him unworthy of her e&s;teem. From this time his vi&s;its became very frequent; in every one of which he di&s;covered &s;ome new perfec|tion. This is the characteri&s;tic of real merit; it is a gainer by being laid open to the in&s;pection of a judicious eye. A man of under&s;tanding will &s;oon be di&s;gu&s;ted with the wanton, the fooli&s;h, and the giddy: but if he has conceived a pa&s;&s;ion for a wo|man worthy of him&s;elf, time, &s;o far from weakening his attachment, can only &s;erve to increa&s;e and &s;trengthen it.</P>
<P>The fixed inclination of Agathocles made him now &s;en&s;ible, that what he felt for Cali&s;ta was love; and that of the mo&s;t tender and pa&s;&s;ionate kind. This he knew; but Cali&s;ta was &s;till unacquainted with it, or at lea&s;t had never learnt it from his lips. Love is timorous and diffident: a bold and daring &s;uitor is not the lover of the lady he addre&s;&s;es: the only object of his love is plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Agathocles at length took the re&s;olution to lay <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pen his heart to Cali&s;ta, but not in the &s;tudied language of a romantic pa&s;&s;ion. "Lovely Cali&s;ta, (&s;aid he, ingenuou&s;ly) it is not merely e&s;teem which engages me to you; but the mo&s;t ardent and tender affection. I feel that I cannot live without you. Can you without reluctance re&s;olve to make me hap|py? I have hitherto loved without offending you, this is a tribute which your merit demands; but may I flatter my&s;elf with the hope, that you will make me &s;ome &s;mall return?" A coquette would have affected to be di&s;plea&s;ed; but Cali&s;ta not only heard her lover without interruption, but an&s;wered him without &s;everily, and permitted him to hope. Nor did &s;he put his con&s;tancy to a needle&s;s trial. The happine&s;s for which he &s;ighed was deferred no longer than was proper to make the nece&s;&s;ary prep|arations. The marriage-&s;ettlements were ea&s;ily ad|ju&s;ted;

for in the&s;e &s;ordid intere&s;t had no &s;hare; this &s;olemn contract chiefly con&s;i&s;ted in a mutual ex|change of hearts, and this was already performed. What will be the lot of this newly wedded pair? I will venture to foretel that it will be the happie&s;t mortals can enjoy on earth. No plea&s;ure is com|parable to that which affects the heart; nor does any other affect it with &s;uch exqui&s;ite delight as the plea&s;ure of loving and being beloved. To this tender union of &s;ouls we can never apply the words of Democritus, that "the plea&s;ure of love is only a &s;hort epilep&s;y." He without doubt had that &s;en|&s;ual plea&s;ure in his thought, which is &s;o different from love, that the enjoyment may be without the pa&s;&s;ion, and the pa&s;&s;ion without the enjoyment. Their love will be con&s;tant; this I dare prophe&s;y, and I know the cau&s;e: their pa&s;&s;ion is not founded on the dazzling charms of beauty, they are both the friends of virtue: they love each other on this account; their love, therefore, will la&s;t as long as their virtue, and the continuance of that is &s;ecured by their union: for nothing can &s;ecure our per&s;e|verance in the paths of wi&s;dom &s;o effectually as hav|ing ince&s;&s;antly a loving and beloved example walk|ing before us. Their felicity can never be di&s;turbed unle&s;s by tho&s;e di&s;a&s;ters and misfortunes from which their mutual tenderne&s;s cannot &s;helter them: but &s;uppo&s;ing the&s;e &s;hould fall to their &s;hare, they would then only partake of the common lot of mankind. Tho&s;e who have never ta&s;ted the tender delights of love are equally expo&s;ed to di&s;appointment; and the lover is at lea&s;t a gainer, with re&s;pect to tho&s;e plea|&s;ures which are of great account in the e&s;timation of the value of life. Add to this, that love will greatly dimini&s;h the &s;en&s;e of their misfortunes. It has the peculiar virtue of rendering the &s;ufferings of two well-paired hearts le&s;s acute, and their de|lights more exqui&s;ite. It would &s;eem as if by com|municating their di&s;tre&s;&s;es, each one felt but half

<HEAD><HI>Sapphira</HI>&mdash;An affecting Hi&s;tory.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN Charles, Duke of Burgundy, &s;irnamed the Bold, reigned over &s;pacious dominions, now &s;wallowed up by the power of France, he heaped many favours and honours upon Claudius Rhyn|&s;ault, a German, who had &s;erved him in his wars again&s;t the in&s;ults of his neighbours. The prince him&s;elf was a per&s;on of &s;ingular humanity and ju&s;|tice; and being prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in favour of Ryn&s;ault, upon the decea&s;e of the governor of the chief town of Zealand, gave him that command. He was not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ng &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ated on that government before he ca&s;t his eyes upon Sapphira, a woman of exqui&s;ite beauty, the wife of Paul Danvelt, a wealthy merchant of the city, under his protection and government. Ryn&s;ault was a man of a warm con&s;titution, and vio|lent inclination to women. He knew what it was to enjoy the &s;atisfaction which is reaped from beauty; but was an utter &s;tranger to the d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cencies, honours, and delicacies which attend the pa&s;&s;ion toward them in elegant minds. He could with his tongue utter a pa&s;&s;ion with which his heart was wholly untouched. In &s;hort, he was one of tho&s;e brutal minds which can be gratified with the violation of innocence and beauty, without the lea&s;t pity, pa&s;&s;ion or love to that with which they are &s;o much delighted.</P>
<P>Ryn&s;ault, being re&s;olved to accompli&s;h his will on the wife of Danvelt, left no arts untried to get into a familiarity at her hou&s;e; but &s;he knew his charac|ter

and di&s;po&s;ition too well not to &s;hun all occa&s;ions that might en&s;nare her into his conver&s;ation. The governor de&s;pairing of &s;ucce&s;s by ordinary means, apprehended and impri&s;oned her hu&s;band, under a pretence of an information that he was guilty of a corre&s;pondence with the enemies of the duke, to betray the town into their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. This de&s;ign had its de&s;ired effect; and the wife of the unfortu|nate Danvelt, the day before that which was ap|pointed for his execution, pre&s;ented her&s;elf in the hall of the governor's hou&s;e, and, as he pa&s;&s;ed thro' the apartment, threw her&s;elf at his feet, and hold|ing his knees be&s;eeched his mercy. Ryn&s;ault be|held her with a di&s;&s;embled &s;atisfaction; and a&s;&s;um|ing an air of thought and authority, he bid her ri&s;e, and told her &s;he mu&s;t follow him to his clo&s;et; and a&s;king her if &s;he knew the hand of the letter he pulled out of his pocket, went from her, leaving this admo|nition aloud: "If you will &s;ave your hu&s;band, you mu&s;t give me an account of all you know, without prev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rication; for every body is &s;atisfied, that he is too fond of you to be able to hide from you the names of the re&s;t of the con&s;pirators, or any other particulars whatever." He went to his clo&s;et, and &s;oon after the lady was &s;ent for to an audience. The &s;ervant knew his di&s;tance when matters of &s;tate were to be debated; and the governor, laying a&s;ide the air with which he had appeared in public, began to be the &s;uppliant, and to rally an affliction which it was in her power ea&s;ily to remove. She ea&s;ily per|ceived his intention; and, bathed in tears, began to deprecate &s;o wicked a de&s;ign. Lu&s;t, like ambition, takes all the faculties of the mind and body into its &s;ervice and &s;ubjection. Her becoming tears, her hone&s;t angui&s;h, the wringing of her hands, and the many changes of her po&s;ture and figure in the vehe|mence of &s;peaking, were but &s;o many attitudes in which he beheld her beauty, and farther incentives of his de&s;ire. All humanity was lo&s;t in that one

After this notification, when he &s;aw Sapphira enough di&s;|tracted to make the &s;ubject of their di&s;cour&s;e, to common eyes appear different from what it was, he called &s;ervants to conduct her to the gate. Load|ed with in&s;upportable affliction, &s;he immediately re|pairs to her hu&s;band, and having &s;ignified to the goalers that &s;he had a propo&s;al to make to her hu&s;|band from the governor, &s;he was left alone with him, revealed to him all that had pa&s;&s;ed, and repre|&s;ented the endle&s;s conflict &s;he was in between love to his per&s;on and fidelity to his bed. It is not ea&s;y to imagine the &s;harp affliction this hone&s;t pair were in, upon &s;uch an incident, in lives not u&s;ed to any but ordinary occurrences. The man was bridled by &s;hame from &s;peaking what his fear prompted upon &s;o near an approach of death; but let fall words that &s;ignified to her, he &s;hould not think her polluted, though &s;he had not confe&s;&s;ed to him that the governor had violated her per&s;on, &s;ince he knew her will had no part in the action. She parted from him with this oblique permi&s;&s;ion, to &s;ave a life he had not re&s;olution enough to re&s;ign for the &s;afety of his honour.</P>
<P>The next morning the unhappy Sapphira attend|ed the governor, and being led into a remote apart|ment, &s;ubmitted to his de&s;ires. Rhyn&s;ault com|mended her charms; claimed a familiarity after what had pa&s;&s;ed between them; and with an air of gaiety, in the language of a gallant, bid her return and take her hu&s;band out of pri&s;on: but, continued he, my fair one mu&s;t not be offended that I have taken care he &s;hould not be an interruption to our future a&s;&s;ignations.

Her per&s;on, and a certain gran|deur of &s;orrow, negligent of forms, gained her pa&s;|&s;age into the pre&s;ence of the duke her &s;overeign. As &s;oon as &s;he came into his pre&s;ence, &s;he broke forth into the following words: "Behold, O mighty Charles, a wretch weary of life, though it has always been &s;pent in innocence and virtue.

<Q><L>Marriage is a &s;acred tie&mdash;</L>
<L>It ought not to be &s;ported with.</L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>"REVEREND AND HONORABLE MATRIMONY!"</P>
<P>I Contemplate, with the mixed emotions of plea|&s;ure and awe, the period of a wedding. The moment approaches, in which two rational beings are to have their union cemented by ties, indi&s;&s;oluble except by the &s;troke of death.</P>
<P>A pure friend&s;hip, a &s;incere affection are nece&s;&s;ary preparatives for the endearing relation. The re|ciprocal gift of the hand is indicative of a mutual exchange of kindred &s;ouls, impelled to each other by virtuous love. If the love be not virtuous; if mere per&s;onal beauty, worldly emolument, or the gro&s;&s;er pa&s;&s;ions, excite to enter upon the connubial &s;tate, its bli&s;s will be tran&s;ient, and vanity will be in&s;cribed on the future pro&s;pects of life.</P>
<P>I have long cheri&s;hed an exalted idea of the purity of the female mind, where it has been poli&s;hed and refined by a &s;uitable education. I believe, that the di&s;po&s;ition of the &s;ofter &s;ex towards their lovers is generally pure and cha&s;te. I am per&s;uaded, that a virtuous woman offers a degree of violence to the delicacy of her own feelings, by con&s;enting to be the property, even of the mo&s;t meritorious hu&s;band. It mu&s;t, then, be ungenerous to wound her mode&s;ty by any indecencies of &s;peech upon the occa&s;ion of

her marriage. An innocent hiliarity may ju&s;tly pre|vail among the company a&s;&s;embled at its celebration.

But <HI>double intendres</HI> and every &s;pecies of loo&s;e language &s;hould be invariably excluded, as offering an affront and a &s;tain to one of the mo&s;t &s;acred in&s;titutions of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>The &s;ub&s;equent hi&s;tory of the nuptials of a young gentleman of &s;entiment and an amiable lady, as contained in that ingenious periodical work, THE BABLER, offers it&s;elf as a very in&s;tructive commen|tary on our &s;ubject; and I hope, that it will have a &s;alutary effect on the mind of every reader.</P>
<P>"MY favorite nephew Harry had for &s;ome time conceived a pa&s;&s;ion for Mi&s;s Cornelia Marchmont, whom I e&s;teem as the ab&s;tract of every mental per|fection, and every per&s;onal accompli&s;hment. He came to me, not long &s;ince, with an air of the greate&s;t tran&s;port, and informed me, that Mi&s;s Marchmont had ble&s;&s;ed him with the acknowledgment of a re|ciprocal e&s;teem, and that I was the per&s;on, whom &s;he had pitched upon, to open a negociation between the two families.</P>
<P>"As I do not know any young lady exi&s;ting who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a greater &s;hare of my e&s;teem than Mi&s;s Marchmont, nor ever &s;aw a per&s;on &s;o immediately calculated to make my nephew happy, I &s;hook him cordially by the hand, wi&s;hed him joy from the bot|tom of my heart, and in&s;tantly &s;et out to my &s;i&s;ter, his mother. Luckily, on my entrance, I found Mr. Marchmont, Cornelia's father, chatting with her at the parlour fire; and, as he and I have been inti|mately acquainted for many years, I opened the bu&s;i|ne&s;s of my errand without any ceremony, and this the more e&s;pecially, becau&s;e I knew neither could have any rea&s;onable objection to the match. Every thing turned out as I expected; both were rejoiced at the affection between the young couple; and there being no mighty matters to retard the celebration of
<PB N="239" REF="032623_0238_0FF3F39C586796D0">
the nuptials, I thought it be&s;t to make &s;hort work of the affair, and accordingly fixed the wedding at an early day. The propo&s;ition being approved by the parent of each, I retired to make Harry happy with the intelligence; and in pur&s;uance of the agreement, I &s;aw him ble&s;&s;ed with one of the worthi|e&s;t as well as &s;weete&s;t girls in the univer&s;e.</P>
<P>As I looked upon a wedding to be one of the mo&s;t important calls which either of the &s;exes have in their whole lives for the exertion of an extraordinary delicacy, I was not a little attentive to the behaviour of my two favorites; and it gave me great plea&s;ure to ob&s;erve, upon the whole, that Harry's behaviour was manly, tender, and re&s;pectful, without deviating into that ful&s;ome di&s;agreeable fondne&s;s, of which even men of the be&s;t &s;en&s;e are often guilty, when they have ju&s;t obtained the woman of their heart. As to Cornelia, I never &s;aw a young creature in her &s;ituation conduct her&s;elf with more propriety: to all the dignity of con&s;cious virtue, &s;he joined all the ineffable &s;weetne&s;s of an engaging timidity; and, though &s;he &s;eemed proud of the man, whom &s;he had ju&s;t preferred to all the world, yet &s;he had too much &s;en&s;ibility not to feel &s;ome amiable terrors, at &s;o awful an alteration in her circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>"After the performance of the ceremony, at which a large company were pre&s;ent, Harry judiciou&s;ly pro|po&s;ed an unremitting round of amu&s;ements, which entirely employed the attention of the mo&s;t volatile, and prevented the circulation of tho&s;e indelicate ambiguities, with which occa&s;ions of this kind are frequently di&s;graced. So that our mirth was, as it ought to be, mingled with good &s;en&s;e and manners; and of cour&s;e the harmony could be little liable to interruption, while that harmony was regulated by rea&s;on and civility.</P>
<P>"I have been often &s;hocked, at the &s;olemnization of a marriage, to &s;ee the ridiculous, I had almo&s;t &s;aid the profligate, levity, with which people have

<HEAD>The Italian Pair: Or, Force of Affection.</HEAD>
<P>A Gentleman who is very happy in a beautiful friend, and is a kind of enthu&s;ia&s;t for the mar|ried &s;tate, told me the following &s;tory of an Italian
<PB N="241" REF="032623_0240_0FF3F3A016BC1950">
pair, who were famous for their unalterable con&s;tan|cy and affection. There lived at Genoa a young nobleman named MARINI, who had a large e&s;tate in the i&s;land of Cor&s;ica, whither he went every five for &s;ix years to regulate his affairs. At the age of five and twenty he was married to a beautiful lady, the daughter of a Venetian &s;enator, named MONI|MIA, who had refu&s;ed the greate&s;t matches in Italy, to prefer the fortunate MARINI. As their marriage was founded upon a mutual e&s;teem, their pa&s;&s;ion increa&s;ed in&s;tead of dimini&s;hing by enjoyment, till they became an example of conjugal duty to all who knew them. They had lived many years in this uninterrupted &s;tate of felicity, when MARINI was obliged to make a voyage to Cor&s;ica, which was then di&s;turbed by a rebellious in&s;urrection, in order to &s;ecure his patrimony, by encouraging his depend|ants to &s;tand firm in the defence of their country. But the greate&s;t affliction, and which ab&s;orbed all the re&s;t, was his being nece&s;&s;itated to part for a while from MONIMIA, who, being then far advanced in a &s;tate of pregnancy, was unable to go with him as u&s;ual. When the fatal time of &s;eparation was come, they embraced with the utmo&s;t grief, and the warme&s;t prayers to Heaven for one another's &s;afety. As &s;oon as this afflicting &s;cene was over, MARINI embarked, and having a fair wind, arrived &s;afe at Ba&s;tia in a few hours. The &s;ucce&s;s of the rebels being &s;topped, and the affairs of the i&s;land a little &s;ettled again, our lover began to prepare for his return to Genoa; but as he was walking one day by the harbour where the &s;hips of burthen lay, he heard two &s;ailors, who were ju&s;t arrived, talking of the death of a Genoe&s;e nobleman's wife then ab&s;ent from the republic. This ca&s;ual circum&s;tance greatly alarmed him, and excited his curio&s;ity to li&s;ten far|ther to their conver&s;ation, when, after a little pau&s;e, he heard one of them mention the name of his dear MONIMIA. At the&s;e words, his &s;urprize and afflic|tion
<PB N="242" REF="032623_0241_0FF3F3A248A34208">
were &s;o great, that he had not power to follow the mariners to &s;atisfy his doubt, but in&s;tantly &s;wooned away, and when he recovered, found him|&s;elf &s;urrounded by his own &s;ervants lamenting over him. At the &s;ame time that this happened to MA|RINI, &s;omething of the &s;ame nature equally di&s;tre&s;&s;|ed MONIMIA; for an imperfect account came to Genoa by the captain of a Venetian ve&s;&s;el, that a gentleman named MARINI had been &s;urpri&s;ed near Ba&s;tia by a remaining party of rebels, and that he and all his attendants were killed by them. The&s;e two accounts involved our unfortunate pair in the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s; they immediately took &s;hipping in order to be convinced of what they &s;o much dreaded to know; the one for Cor&s;ica, the other for Genoa. They were both &s;ailed, when a violent &s;torm aro&s;e, which drove their ve&s;&s;els upon a little i&s;land in the Mediterranean. MARINI's &s;hip landed fir&s;t, where, while the re&s;t of the crew were refre&s;hing them&s;elves, the incon&s;olable widower, as he thought him&s;elf, wandered with one &s;ervant only, into a little wood, that was near the &s;ea &s;hore, to give vent to his im|moderate grief. Soon after, the Genoe&s;e &s;hip land|ed too, and the &s;ame motive led MONIMIA with one of her maids to the wood where her hu&s;band was, lamenting his unfortunate condition. They had not been long there, before they heard each other's complaint, and drew nearer mutually to &s;ee if there were any wretch living equally mi&s;erable with them|&s;elves. But how great was the a&s;toni&s;hment of both, when they met in a little path and &s;aw each other! the immoderate joy was &s;uch, and the tran|&s;ition from one extreme to the other &s;o in&s;tantaneous, that all the power they had was to fall into each other's arms, where they expired in a few minutes after. Their bodies were conveyed to Italy, and were interred with all the &s;olemnity and magnifi|cence due to their quality and eminent virtues.</P>

<HEAD>The Unhappy Separation.</HEAD>
<P>IN this capital (Rome) we have ju&s;t now witne&s;&s;ed an event, which has drawn tears from every body here. It is five years &s;ince a young gentleman of the family of Amedei, married an amiable and virtuous young woman he loved, but who&s;e birth was not equal to his. At the end of one year, they had a daughter as the fruit of their love; but this tender union was in a &s;hort time cruelly di&s;turbed by the parents and relations of the gentleman, who exclaimed again&s;t his marriage as clande&s;tine, and obtained again&s;t the unhappy young man an order of the Pope, by virtue of which they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ore him from the arms of his &s;pou&s;e, and conducted him a pri&s;o|ner to the ca&s;tle of St. Angelo. A proce&s;s was im|mediately in&s;tituted for annulling the marriage. The gentleman tried every means po&s;&s;ible, to prove that his marriage was valid, and to have it ratified; his wife went al&s;o with her daughter in her arms, and threw her&s;elf at the feet of her judges; but in vain. A &s;entence was at la&s;t pronounced, annulling the marriage, obliging the mother, that incon&s;olable wife, to write to her hu&s;band with her own hand, the fatal news of their eternal &s;eparation. Oppre&s;&s;ed with the mo&s;t cruel de&s;pair, &s;he thus wrote to him: "I find my&s;elf under the cruel nece&s;&s;ity of renoun|cing tho&s;e &s;weet and &s;acred bands which till now have h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ld our hearts firmly united; but I re&s;ign my&s;elf with le&s;s repugnance, from the con&s;ideration that it will be the means of terminating that long and &s;evere captivity, which you have &s;uffered for my &s;ake.

On the contrary, as &s;oon as I was what they call &s;ettled in the world, they were &s;o affiduous in looking out a wife for me, that nothing was re|quired on my part but immediately to fall in love with the lady they had pitched upon: and could I have complied with their &s;everal choices, I &s;hould have been married at the &s;ame time to a tall, and a &s;hort, a plump, and a &s;lender, a young and an old woman; one with a great deal of money, and ano|ther with none at all: each of whom were &s;everally recommended by them as the propere&s;t per&s;on in the world for me.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Lucretia</HI>&mdash;An Intere&s;ting Story. Founded on Fact.</HEAD>
<P>LUCRETIA was a woman of great beauty and noble extraction; &s;he married Collatinus, a relation of Tarquinius Superbus, king of Rome. During the &s;iege of Ardea, which la&s;ted much long|er than was expected, the young princes pa&s;&s;ed their time in entertainments and diver&s;ions. One day as they were at &s;upper, at Sextus Tarquin's, the king's elde&s;t &s;on, with Collatinus, Lucretia's hu&s;band, the conver&s;ation turned on the merit of their wives: every one gave his own the preference. "What &s;ignify &s;o many words?" &s;ays Collatinus; "you may in a few hours, if you plea&s;e, be convinced by your own eyes, how much my Lucretia excels the the re&s;t. We are young: let us mount our hor&s;es, and go and &s;urpri&s;e them. Nothing can better de|cide our di&s;pute than the &s;tate we &s;hall find them in at a time, when mo&s;t certainly they will not expect us." They were a little warmed with wine: "Come on, let us go," they all cried together. They quickly galloped to Rome, which was about twenty miles from Ardea, where they find the prince&s;&s;es, wives of the young Tarquins, &s;urrounded with company, and every circum&s;tance of the highe&s;t mirth and plea&s;ure. From thence they rode to Collatia, where they &s;aw Lucretia in a very different &s;ituation. With her maids about her, &s;he was at work in the inner
<PB N="248" REF="032623_0247_0FF3F3AED26D4900">
part of her hou&s;e, talking on the dangers to which her hu&s;band was expo&s;ed. The victory was adjudg|ed to her unanimou&s;ly. She received her gue&s;ts with all po&s;&s;ible politene&s;s and civility. Lucretia's virtue, which &s;hould have commanded re&s;pect, was the very thing which kindled in the brea&s;t of Sextus Tarquin a &s;trong and dete&s;table pa&s;&s;ion. Within a few days he returned to Collatia, and upon the plau|&s;ible excu&s;e he made for his vi&s;it, he was received with all the politene&s;s due to a near relation, and the elde&s;t &s;on of a king. Watching the fitte&s;t oppor|tunity, he declares the pa&s;&s;ion &s;he had excited at his la&s;t vi&s;it, and employed the mo&s;t tender intreaties, and all the artifices po&s;&s;ible to touch a woman's heart; but all to no purpo&s;e. He then endeavoured to extort her compliance by the mo&s;t terrible threat|enings. It was in vain. She &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in her re&s;olution; nor could &s;he be moved, even by the fear of death. But, when the mon&s;ter told her that he would fir&s;t di&s;patch her, and then having mur|dered a &s;lave, would lay him by her &s;ide, after which he would &s;pread a report, that having caught them in the act of adultery, he had puni&s;hed them as they de&s;erved; this &s;eemed to &s;hake her re&s;olution. She he&s;itated, not knowing which of the&s;e dreadful alter|natives to take, whether, by con&s;enting, to di&s;honor the bed of her hu&s;band, whom &s;he tenderly loved; or, by refu&s;ing, to die under the odious character of having pro&s;tituted her per&s;on to the lu&s;t of a &s;lave. He &s;aw the &s;truggle of her &s;oul; and &s;eizing the un|lucky moment, obtained an inglorious conque&s;t. Thus Lucretia's virtue, which had been proof again&s;t the fear of death, could not hold out again&s;t the fear of infamy. The young prince, having gratified his pa&s;&s;ion, returned home as in triumph.</P>
<P>On the morrow, Lucretia, overwhelmed with grief and de&s;pair, &s;ent early in the morning to de&s;ire her father and her hu&s;band to come to her, and bring with them each a tru&s;ty friend, a&s;&s;uring them there
<PB N="249" REF="032623_0248_0FF3F3B05AF43520">
was no time to lo&s;e. They came with all &s;peed, the one accompanied with Valerius, (&s;o famous after under the name of Publicola) and the other with Brutus. The moment &s;he &s;aw them come, &s;he could not command her tears; and when her hu&s;band a&s;ked her if all was well: "By no means," &s;aid &s;he, "it cannot be well with a woman after &s;he has lo&s;t her honor. Yes, Collatinus, thy bed has been de|filed by a &s;tranger: but my body only is polluted; my mind is innocent, as my death &s;hall witne&s;s. Promi&s;e me only, not to &s;uffer the adulterer to go unpuni&s;hed: it is Sextus Tarquinius, who la&s;t night, treacherous gue&s;t, or rather cruel foe, offered me violence, and reaped a joy fatal to me; but, if you are men, it will be &s;till more fatal to him." All promi&s;ed to revenge her: and, at the &s;ame time, tried to comfort her with repre&s;enting, "That the mind only &s;ins, not the body; and where the con&s;ent is wanting, there can be no guilt." "What Sextus de&s;erves," replies Lucretia, "I leave you to judge; but for me, though I declare my&s;elf innocent of the crime, I exempt not my&s;elf from puni&s;hment. No immode&s;t woman &s;hall plead Lucretia's example to outlive her di&s;honor." Thus &s;aying, &s;he plunged into her brea&s;t a dagger &s;he had concealed under her robe, and expired at their feet.</P>
<P>Lucretia's tragical death has been prai&s;ed and ex|tolled by Pagan writers, as the highe&s;t and mo&s;t noble act of heroi&s;m. The go&s;pel thinks not &s;o: it is murder, even according to Lucretia's own princi|ples, &s;ince &s;he puni&s;hed with death an innocent per|&s;on, at lea&s;t acknowledged as &s;uch by her&s;elf. She was ignorant that our life is not in our own power, but in his di&s;po&s;al from whom we receive it.</P>
<P>St. Au&s;tin, who carefully examines, in his book, what we are to think of Lucretia's death, con&s;iders it not as a courageous action, flowing from a true love of cha&s;tity, but as an infirmity of a woman too &s;en&s;ible of worldly &s;ame and glory; and who, from
<PB N="250" REF="032623_0249_0FF3F3B1E3158588">
a dread of appearing in the eyes of men an accom|plice of the violence &s;he abhorred, and of a crime to which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he was entirely a &s;tranger, commits a real crime upon her&s;elf voluntarily and de&s;ignedly. But what can not be &s;ufficiently admired in this Roman lady is her abhorrence of adultery, which &s;he &s;eems to hold &s;o dete&s;table as not to bear the thoughts of it. In this &s;en&s;e, &s;he is a noble example for all her &s;ex.</P>

<HEAD>The Trial, Sufferings, and Death of Mrs. <HI>A&s;kew.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SIR William A&s;kew, of Kel&s;ay, in Lincoln&s;hire, was ble&s;&s;ed with &s;everal daughters. His &s;econd, named Anne, had received a genteel education; which, with an agreeable per&s;on, and good under|&s;tanding, rendered her a very proper per&s;on to be at the head of a family. Her father, regardle&s;s of his daughter's inclination and happine&s;s, obliged her to marry a gentleman who had nothing to recom|mend him but his fortune, and who was a mo&s;t big|oted papi&s;t. No &s;ooner was he convinced of his wife's regard for the doctrines of the reformation from popery, than, by the in&s;tigation of the prie&s;ts, he violently drove her from his hou&s;e, though &s;he had borne him two children, and her conduct was unexceptionable. Abandoned by her hu&s;band, &s;he came up to London, in order to procure a divorce, and to make her&s;elf known to that part of the court who either profe&s;&s;ed, or were favourers of prote&s;tant|i&s;m: but, as Henry VIII. with con&s;ent of parliament, had ju&s;t enacted the law of the &s;ix articles, commonly called, the bloody &s;tatute, &s;he was cruelly betrayed by her own hu&s;band; and, upon his information, taken into cu&s;tody, and examined concerning her faith. The act above mentioned denounced death again&s;t all tho&s;e who &s;hould deny the doctrine of Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation; or, that the bread and wine
<PB N="251" REF="032623_0250_0FF3F3B4B4FD8958">
made u&s;e of in the &s;acrament was not converted after con&s;ecration into the REAL body and blood of Chri&s;t; or, maintain the nece&s;&s;ity of receiving the &s;acrament in both kinds; or affirm, that it was lawful for prie&s;ts to marry; that the vows of celibacy might be brok|en; that private ma&s;&s;es were of no avail; and that auricular confe&s;&s;ion to a prie&s;t was not nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation. Upon the&s;e articles, &s;he was examined by the inqui&s;itor, a prie&s;t, the lord-mayor of London, and the bi&s;hop's chancellor; and to all their queries gave proper and pertinent an&s;wers; but not being &s;uch as they approved; &s;he was &s;ent back to pri&s;on; where &s;he remained eleven days to ruminate alone on her alarming &s;ituation, and was denied the &s;mall con&s;olation of a friendly vi&s;it. The king's council being at Greenwich, &s;he was once more examined by chancellor Wriothe&s;ley, Gardiner bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, Dr. Cox, and Dr. Robin&s;on; but not be|ing able to convince her of her &s;uppo&s;ed errors, &s;he was &s;ent to the tower. It was &s;trongly &s;u&s;pected, that Mrs. A&s;kew was favored by &s;ome ladies of high rank; and that &s;he carried on a religious corre&s;|pondence with the queen. So that the chancellor Wriothe&s;ley, hoping that he might di&s;cover &s;ome|thing that would afford matter of impeachment again&s;t that prince&s;s, the earl of Hertford, or his counte&s;s, who all favoured the reformation, ordered her to be put to the rack: but her fortitude in &s;uf|fering, and her re&s;olution not to betray her friends, was proof again&s;t that diabolical invention. Not a groan, not a word could be extorted from her. The chancellor, provoked with what he called her ob&s;ti|nacy, augmented her tortures with his own hands, and with unheard of violence: but her courage and con&s;tancy were invincible; and the&s;e barbarians gained nothing by their cruelties, but everla&s;ting di&s;grace and infamy. As &s;oon as &s;he was taken from the rack &s;he fainted away; but, being recovered, &s;he was condemned to the flames. Her bones were
<PB N="252" REF="032623_0251_0FF3F3B6E08B40C8">
di&s;located in &s;uch a manner, that they were forced to carry her in a chair to the place of execution. While &s;he was at the &s;take, letters were brought her from the lord-chancellor, offering the king's pardon if &s;he would recant. But &s;he refu&s;ed to look at them; telling the me&s;&s;enger, that "&s;he came not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hither to deny her Lord and Ma&s;ter." The &s;ame letters were al&s;o tendered to three other per&s;ons, condemned to the &s;ame fate; and who, animated by her example, refu&s;ed to accept them. Whereupon the lord mayor commanded the fire to be kindled; and, with &s;avage ignorance cried out, FIAT JUSTITIA, Let ju&s;tice take its cour&s;e. The faggots being light|ed, &s;he commended her &s;oul, with the utmo&s;t com|po&s;ure, into the hands of her Maker; and, like the great Founder of the religion &s;he profe&s;&s;ed, expired, praying for her murderers, July 16, 1546, about the 25th year of her age.</P>
<P>I do not know if all circum&s;tances are con&s;idered, whether the hi&s;tory of this, or any other nation, can furni&s;h a more illu&s;trious example than this now related. To her father's will &s;he &s;acrificed her own inclinations. To a hu&s;band unworthy of her affec|tions, &s;he behaved with prudence, re&s;pect, and obe|dience. The &s;ecrets of her friends &s;he pre&s;erved inviolable, even amid&s;t the tortures of the rack. Her con&s;tancy in &s;uffering, con&s;idering her age and &s;ex, was equal, at lea&s;t, if not &s;uperior, to any thing on record: and her piety was genuine and unaffected; of which &s;he gave the mo&s;t exalted proof in dying a martyr for the cau&s;e of her religion, and liberty of con&s;cience. But who can read this example, and not lament and dete&s;t that &s;pirit of cruelty and inhu|manity which is imbibed and cheri&s;hed in the church of Rome! a &s;pirit repugnant to the feelings of na|ture, and directly oppo&s;ite to the conduct and di&s;po|&s;ition of the great Author of our religion, who came not to de&s;troy men's lives, but to &s;ave them: and, in&s;tead of delighting in the death of a &s;inner, gave
<PB N="253" REF="032623_0252_0FF3F3B869E622A0">
his own life a ran&s;om for theirs. On the contrary, who that is not &s;unk into brutality can &s;ee, without horror, a man, a prie&s;t, pretending to be influenced by the love and honor of God, torturing a woman who&s;e youth and beauty might have di&s;armed the mo&s;t &s;avage re&s;entment, and after often wearying him&s;elf in this diabolical &s;ervice, committing her to the flames, for not believing the gro&s;&s;e&s;t ab&s;urdities and impo&s;&s;ibilities? Who can &s;ee animo&s;ities, hatred and variance, encouraged and fomented between man and wife, and the one prompted and per&s;uaded to contrive and effect the death of the other, and not abandon a religion that ju&s;tifies &s;uch a practice?</P>

<HEAD>Noble Example of Virtue in <HI>Scipio.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SCIPIO the younger, when only twenty four years of age, was appointed by the Roman republic to the command of the army again&s;t the Spaniards. His wi&s;dom and valour would have done honour to the mo&s;t experienced General. Determined to &s;trike an important blow, he formed a de&s;ign of be&s;ieging Carthagena, then the capital of the Carthagenian empire in Spain. His mea&s;ures were &s;o judiciou&s;ly concerted, and with &s;o much courage and intrepidity pur&s;ued, both by &s;ea and lend, that notwith&s;tanding a bold and vigorous defence, the capital was taken by &s;torm. The plunder was immen&s;e. Ten thou|&s;and freemen were made pri&s;oners: and above three hundred more of both &s;exes, were received as ho&s;ta|ges. One of the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tter, a very ancient lady, the wife of Mandonius, brother of Indibilis, king of the Iler|getes, watching her opportunity, came out of the crowd, and, throwing her&s;elf at the conqueror's feet, conjured him, with tears in her eyes, to recommend to tho&s;e who had the ladies in their keeping, to have regard to their &s;ex and birth. Scipio, who did
<PB N="254" REF="032623_0253_0FF3F3BA9554E830">
not under&s;tand her meaning at fir&s;t, a&s;&s;ured her that he had given orders that they &s;hould not want for any thing. But the lady replied, "Tho&s;e conveni|ences are not what affect us. In the condition to which fortune hath reduced us, with what ought we not to be contented? I have many other appre|hen&s;ions, when I con&s;ider, on one &s;ide, the licen|tiou&s;ne&s;s of war; and, on the other, the youth and beauty of the prince&s;&s;es, which you &s;ee here before us; for as to me, my age protects me from all fear in this re&s;pect." She had with her the daughters of Indibilis, and &s;everal other ladies of high rank, all in the flower of youth, who con&s;idered her as their mother. Scipio, then comprehending what the &s;ubject of her fear was, "My own glory, (&s;ays he) "and that of the Roman people, are concerned in not &s;uffering that virtue, which ought always to be re&s;pected, wherever we find it, &s;hould be expo&s;ed in my camp to a treatment unworthy of it. But you give me a new motive for being more &s;trict in my care of it, in the virtuous &s;olicitude you &s;hew in thinking only of the pre&s;ervation of your honor in the mid&s;t of &s;o many other objects of fear." After this conver&s;ation, he committed the care of the la|dies to &s;ome officers of experienced prudence, &s;trictly commanding, that they &s;hould treat them with all the re&s;pect they could pay to the mothers, wives, and daughters of their allies and particular friends. It was not long before Scipio's integrity and virtue were put to the trial. Being retired into his camp, &s;ome of his officers brought him a virgin of &s;uch exqui&s;ite beauty, that &s;he drew upon her the eyes and admiration of every body. The young con|queror &s;tarted from his &s;eat with confu&s;ion and &s;ur|prize; and, like one thunder-&s;truck, &s;eemed to be robbed of that pre&s;ence of mind and &s;elf-po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;o nece&s;&s;ary in a General, and for which Scipio was remarkably famous. In a few moments, having ral|lied his &s;traggling &s;pirits, he inquired of the beauti|ful
<PB N="255" REF="032623_0254_0FF3F3BCCAA9C838">
captive, in the mo&s;t civil and polite manner, con|cerning her country, birth, and connections; and finding that &s;he was betrothed to a Celtiberian prince, named Allucius, he ordered both him and the cap|tive's parent's to be &s;ent for. The Spani&s;h prince no &s;ooner appeared in his pre&s;ence than, even be|fore he &s;poke to the father and mother, he took him a&s;ide; and, to remove the anxiety he might be in on account of the young lady, he addre&s;&s;ed him thus: "You and I are young, which admits of my &s;peak|ing to you with more-liberty. Tho&s;e who brought me your future &s;pou&s;e, a&s;&s;ured me, at the &s;ame time, that you loved her with extreme tenderne&s;s; and her beauty left me no room to doubt it. Upon which reflecting, that if, like you, I had thought of making an engagement, and were not wholly engro&s;&s;ed with the affairs of my country, I &s;hould de&s;ire that &s;o honorable and legitimate a pa&s;&s;ion &s;hould find fa|vour. I think my&s;elf happy in the pre&s;ent conjunc|ture to do you this &s;ervice. Though the fortune of war has made me your ma&s;ter, I de&s;ire to be your friend. Here is your wife: take her, and may the gods ble&s;s you with her. One thing, however, I would have you to be fully a&s;&s;ured of, that &s;he has been among us as &s;he would have been in the hou&s;e of her father and mother. Far be it from Scipio to purcha&s;e a loo&s;e and momentary plea&s;ure at the expence of virtue, honour, and the happine&s;s of an hone&s;t man. No&mdash;I have kept her for you, in order to make you a pre&s;ent worthy of you and of me. The only gratitude I require of you for this ine&s;timable gift, is, that you would be a friend to the Roman people." Allucius's heart was too full to make him any an&s;wer; but throwing him&s;elf at the General's feet he wept aloud. The captive lady fell into the &s;ame po&s;ture; and remained &s;o, till the father bur&s;t out into the following words: "O divine Scipio! the gods have given you more than human virtue! O glorious leader! O wond|rous
<PB N="256" REF="032623_0255_0FF3F3BF017C14C8">
youth! does not that obliged virgin give you, while &s;he prays to the gods for your pro&s;perity, rap|tures above all the tran&s;ports yon could have reaped from the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her injured per&s;on?"</P>
<P>The relations of the young lady had brought with them a very con&s;iderable &s;um for her ran&s;om: but when they &s;aw that &s;he was re&s;tored to them in a manner &s;o generous and godlike, they intreated the conqueror with great earne&s;tne&s;s, to accept that &s;um as a pre&s;ent; and declared, by his complying, that new favour would complete their joy and grat|itude. Scipio, not being able to re&s;i&s;t &s;uch warm and earne&s;t &s;olicitations, told them, that he accepted the gift; and ordered it to be laid at his feet: then addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Lucius, "I add," &s;ays he, "to the portion which you are to receive from your father-in-law this &s;um; which I de&s;ire you to ac|cept as a marriage pre&s;ent."</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider that Scipio was at this time in the prime of life, unmarried, and under no re&s;traint, we cannot but acknowledge, that the conque&s;t he made of him&s;elf was far more glorious than that of the Carthagenian empire: and though his treat|ment of this captive prince was not more delicate and generous than what might ju&s;tly be expected from a per&s;on endowed with rea&s;on and reflection; yet con&s;idering how few there are in his circum|&s;tances who would have acted as he did, we cannot but applaud his conduct, and propo&s;e him as a &s;uit|able example to future ages. Nor was his virtue unrewarded. The young prince, charmed with the liberality and politene&s;s of Scipio, went into his country to publi&s;h the prai&s;es of a victor &s;o generous. He cried out, in the tran&s;ports of his gratitude, "that there was come into Spain a young hero like the gods; who conquered all things le&s;s by the force of his arms, than the charms of his virtue, and the greatne&s;s of his beneficence." Upon this report, all Celtiberia &s;ubmitted to the Romans; and Allucius
<PB N="257" REF="032623_0256_0FF3F3C08CCC0040">
returned in a &s;hout to Scipio, at the head of four|teen hundred cho&s;en hor&s;e, to facilitate his future conque&s;ts. To render the marks of his gratitude &s;till more durable, Allucius cau&s;ed the action we have ju&s;t related to be engraven on a &s;ilver &s;hield, which he pre&s;ented to Scipio; a pre&s;ent infinitely more e&s;timable and glorious than all his trea&s;ures and triumphs. This buckler, which Scipio carried with him when he returned to Rome, was lo&s;t, in pa&s;&s;ing the Rhine with part of the baggage. It continued in that river, till the year 1665, when &s;ome fi&s;hermen found it. It is now in the cabinet of the king of France.</P>

<P>GOING ye&s;terday to dine with an old acquain|tance, I had the misfortune to find his whole family very much dejected. Upon a&s;king him the occa&s;ion of it, he told me that his wife had dreamt a very &s;trange dream the night before, which they were afraid portended &s;ome misfortune to them|&s;elves or their children. At her coming into the room I ob&s;erved a &s;ettled melancholy in her coun|tenance, which I &s;hould have been troubled for, had I not heard from whence it proceeded. We were no &s;ooner &s;et down, but after having looked upon me a little while, "My dear, (&s;ays &s;he) turning to her hu&s;band, you may now &s;ee the &s;tranger that was in the candle la&s;t night." Soon after this, as they
<PB N="258" REF="032623_0257_0FF3F3C2B5E9FC98">
began to talk of family affairs, a little boy at the other end of the table told her, that he was to go into joining-hand on <HI>Thur&s;day: "Thur&s;day!</HI> (&s;ays &s;he) no child, if it plea&s;e God, you &s;hall not begin upon <HI>Childermas-day</HI>; tell your writing-ma&s;ter that <HI>Friday</HI> will be &s;oon enough." I was reflecting with|in my&s;elf on the oddne&s;s of her fancy, and wonder|ing that any body would e&s;tabli&s;h it as a rule to lo&s;e a day in every week. In the mid&s;t of the&s;e my mu|&s;ings, &s;he de&s;ired me to reach her a little &s;alt upon the point of my knife, which I did, in &s;uch a trepi|dation and hurry of obedience, that I let it drop by the way; at which &s;he immediately &s;tarted, and &s;aid it fell towards her.</P>
<P>Upon this I looked very black; and ob&s;erving the concern of the whole table, began to con&s;ider my&s;elf, with &s;ome confu&s;ion, as a per&s;on who had brought a di&s;a&s;ter upon the family. The lady, however, recovering her&s;elf after a little &s;pace, &s;aid to her hu&s;band with a &s;igh, "My dear, misfortunes never come &s;ingle." My friend, I found, acted but an under part at his table, and being a man of more good nature than under&s;tanding, thinks him&s;elf obliged to fall in with all the pa&s;&s;ions and humours of his yoke-fellow: "do you remember, child, (&s;aid &s;he) that the pigeon-hou&s;e fell the very afternoon that our carele&s;s wench &s;pilt the &s;alt upon the table!" "yes, my dear (&s;ays he) and the next po&s;t brought us an account of the battle of <HI>Almanza.</HI>" The read|er may gue&s;s at the figure I made, after having done all this mi&s;chief. I di&s;patched my dinner as fa&s;t as I could, with my u&s;ual taciturnity; when, to my utter confu&s;ion, the lady &s;eeing me quitting my knife and fork, and laying them acro&s;s one another upon my plate, de&s;ired me that I would humour her &s;o far as to take them out of that figure, and place them &s;ide by &s;ide. What the ab&s;urdity was which I had committed, I did not know, but I &s;uppo&s;e there was &s;ome traditionary &s;uper&s;tition in it; and there|fore,
<PB N="259" REF="032623_0258_0FF3F3C4EF8DA520">
in obedience to the lady of the hou&s;e, I di&s;po|&s;ed of my knife and fork in two parallel lines, which is a figure I &s;hall always lay them in for the future, though I do not know any rea&s;on for it.</P>
<P>It is not difficult for a man to &s;ee that a per&s;on has conceived <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n aver&s;ion to him. For my own part, I quickly found, by the lady's looks, that &s;he regarded me as a very odd kind of a fellow, with an unfortunate a&s;pect: for which rea&s;on I took my leave immediately after dinner, and withdrew to my own lodgings. Upon my return home, I fell into a profound contemplation on the evils which attend tho&s;e &s;uper&s;titious follies of mankind; how they &s;ub|ject us to imaginary afflictions, and additional &s;or|rows, which do not properly come within our lot. As if the natural calamities of life were not &s;ufficient for it, we turn the mo&s;t indifferent circum&s;tances into misfortunes, and &s;uffer as much from trifling accidents as from real evils. I have known the &s;hooting of a &s;tar &s;poil a night's re&s;t; and have &s;een a man in love grow pale and lo&s;e his appetite, upon the plucking of a merry thought. A &s;creech owl at midnight has alarmed a family more than a band of robbers; nay, the voice of a cricket has &s;truck more terror than the roaring of a lion. There is nothing &s;o incon&s;iderable, which may not appear dreadful to an imagination filled with omens and progno&s;tics. A ru&s;ty nail, or crooked pin, &s;hoots up into prodigies.</P>
<P>I remember I was once in a mixed a&s;&s;embly, that was full of noi&s;e and mirth, when on a &s;udden an old woman unluckily ob&s;erved there were thirteen of us in company. The remark &s;truck a panic of terror into &s;everal who were pre&s;ent, in&s;omuch that one or two of the ladies were going to leave the room; but a friend of mine taking notice that one of our female companions was big with child, affirm|ed there were fourteen in the room, and that in&s;tead of portending that one of the company &s;hould die,
<PB N="260" REF="032623_0259_0FF3F3C72E0F0400">
it plainly foretold that one of them &s;hould be born. Had not my friend found this experiment to break the omen, I que&s;tion not but half the women in the company would have fallen &s;ick that very night.</P>
<P>An old maid, who is troubled with the vapours, produces infinite di&s;turbances of this kind among her friends and neighbours. I knew a maiden aunt of a great family, who is one of tho&s;e antiquated <HI>&s;ibyls,</HI> who forebode and prophecy from one end of the year to the other. She is always &s;eeing appari|tions, and hearing dead watches; and was the other day almo&s;t frightned out of her wits by the great hou&s;e-dog, that howled in the &s;table at the time when &s;he lay ill of the tooth-ach.</P>
<P>Such an extravagant ca&s;t of mind engages multi|tudes of people, not only in impertinent terror, but in &s;upernumerary duties of life; and ari&s;es from that fear and ignorance which is natural to the &s;oul of man. The horror with which we entertain the thoughts of death, (or indeed of any future evil) and the uncertainty of its approach, fill a melancho|ly mind with innumerable apprehen&s;ions and &s;u&s;pi|cions, and con&s;equently di&s;po&s;e it to the ob&s;ervation of &s;uch groundle&s;s prodigies and predictions. For, as it is the chief concern of wi&s;e men to retrench the evils of life by the rea&s;onings of philo&s;ophy, it is the employment of fools to multiply them by the &s;entiments of &s;uper&s;tition.</P>
<P>For my own part, I &s;hould be very much troubled were I endowed with this divining quality, though it &s;hould inform me truly of every thing that can befal me: I would not anticipate the reli&s;h of any happine&s;s, nor feel the weight of any mi&s;ery, before it actually arrives.</P>
<P>I know but one way of fortifying my &s;oul again&s;t the&s;e gloomy pre&s;ages and terrors of mind; and that is, by &s;ecuring to my&s;elf the friend&s;hip and protec|tion of that Being, who di&s;po&s;es of events, and gov|erns futurity. He &s;ees, at one view, the whole
<PB N="261" REF="032623_0260_0FF3F3C8B9792A50">
thread of my exi&s;tence; not only that part of it which I have already pa&s;&s;ed through, but that which runs forward into all the depths of eternity. When I lay me down to &s;leep, I recommend my&s;elf to his care; when I awake, I give my&s;elf to his direction. Amid&s;t all the evils that threaten me, I will look up to him for help, and que&s;tion not but he will either avert, or turn them to my advantage. Though I know neither the time nor the manner of the death I am to die, I am not at all &s;olicitous about it; becau&s;e I am &s;ure that he knows them both, and that he will not fail to comfort and &s;upport me under them.</P>

<P>I remember la&s;t winter there were &s;everal young girls of the neighbourhood &s;itting about the fire with my landlady's daughters, and telling &s;tories of &s;pirits and apparitions. Upon my opening the door, the young women broke off their di&s;cour&s;e; but my landlady's daughter telling them that it was no body but the gentleman, (for that is the name I go by in the neighbourhood, as well as in the family) they went on without minding me. I &s;eated my&s;elf by the candle that &s;tood on a table at one end of the room; and pretending to read a book which I took out of my pocket, heard &s;everal dreadful &s;tories of gho&s;ts as pale as a&s;hes that had &s;tood at the foot of a bed, or walked over a church-yard by moon-light; and of others that had been conjured into the <HI>Red-Sea,</HI> for di&s;turbing people's re&s;t, and drawing their curtains at mid-night; with many other old women's fables of the like nature. As one &s;pirit rai&s;ed ano|ther, I ob&s;erved that at the end of every &s;tory the whole company clo&s;ed their ranks, and crowded about the fire. I took notice, in particular, of a
<PB N="262" REF="032623_0261_0FF3F3CAE6C9F650">
little boy, who was &s;o attentive to every &s;tory, that I mi&s;take if he ventures to go to bed by him&s;elf the&s;e twelve months. Indeed they talked &s;o long, that the imaginations of the whole a&s;&s;embly were mani|fe&s;tly crazed, and I am &s;ure will be the wor&s;e for it as long as they live. I heard one of the girls who had looked upon me over her &s;houlder, a&s;king the company how long I had been in the room, and whether I did not look paler than I u&s;ed to do. This put me under &s;ome apprehen&s;ions that I &s;hould be forced to explain my&s;elf, if I did nor retire; for which rea&s;on I took the candle in my hand, and went up into my chamber, not without wondering at this unaccountable weakne&s;s in human creatures, that they &s;hould love to a&s;toni&s;h and terrify one ano|ther. Were I a father, I &s;hould take particular care to pre&s;erve my children from the&s;e little horrors of imagination which they are apt to contract when they are young, and are not able to &s;hake off when they are in years. I have known a &s;oldier who has entered a breach, affrighted at his own &s;hadow, and look pale at a little &s;cratching at his door, who the day before had marched up again&s;t a battery of can|non. There are in&s;tances of per&s;ons who have been terrified even to di&s;traction at the figure of a tree, or &s;haking of a bull-ru&s;h. The truth of it is, I look upon a &s;ound imagination as the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing of life, next to a clear judgment and a good con|&s;cience. In the mean time, &s;ince there are very few who&s;e minds are not more or le&s;s &s;ubject to the&s;e dreadful thoughts and apprehen&s;ions, we ought to arm our&s;elves again&s;t them by the dictates of rea&s;on and religion, <HI>to pull the old woman out of our hearts,</HI> and annihilate tho&s;e impertinent notions which we imbibed at a time when we were not able to judge of their ab&s;urdity.</P>

<P>I Have &s;ometimes heard it di&s;puted in conver&s;ation, whether it be more laudable or de&s;irable, that a man &s;hould think too highly or too meanly of him|&s;elf: it is on all hands agreed to be be&s;t, that he &s;hould think rightly; but &s;ince a falliable being will always make &s;ome deviations from exact rectitude, it is not wholly u&s;ele&s;s to inquire towards which &s;ide it is &s;afer to incline.</P>
<P>The prejudices of mankind &s;eem to favour him who errs by under-rating his own powers; he is con|&s;idered as a mode&s;t and harmle&s;s member of &s;ociety, not likely to break the peace by competition, to en|deavour after &s;uch &s;plendor of reputation as may dim the lu&s;tre of others, or to interrupt any in the enjoyment of them&s;elves; he is no man's rival, and therefore may be every man's friend.</P>
<P>The opinion which a man entertains of him&s;elf, ought to be di&s;tingui&s;hed, in order to an accurate di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this que&s;tion, as it relates to per&s;ons or to things. To think highly of our&s;elves in compari|&s;on with others, to a&s;&s;ume by our own authority that precedence which none are willing to grant, mu&s;t be always invidious and offen&s;ive; but to rate our powers high in proportion to things, and imagine our&s;elves equal to great undertakings, while we leave others in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;ame abilities, cannot with equal ju&s;tice provoke cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that &s;elf-love may di&s;po&s;e us to decide too ha&s;tily in our own favour; but who is hurt by the mi&s;take? If we are incited by this vain opinion to attempt more than we can perform, ours is the labour, and ours the di&s;grace.</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="032623_0263_0FF3F3CF87EE51B8">But he who dares to think well of him&s;elf, will not always prove to be mi&s;taken; and the good effects of his confidence will then appear in great attempts, and great performances: if he &s;hould not fully com|plete his de&s;ign, he will at lea&s;t advance it &s;o far, as to leave an ea&s;y ta&s;k for him who &s;ucceeds him; and even though he &s;hould wholly fall, he will fall with honor.</P>
<P>But from the oppo&s;ite error, from torpid de&s;pond|ency can come no advantage; it is the fro&s;t of the &s;oul which binds up all its powers, and congeals life in perpetual &s;terility. He who has no hopes of &s;uc|ce&s;s, will make no attempts; and where nothing is attempted, nothing will be done.</P>
<P>Every man &s;hould, therefore, endeavour to main|tain in him&s;elf a favorable opinion of the powers of the human mind; which are, perhaps, in every man greater than they appear, and might, by diligent cultivation, be exalted to a degree beyond what their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or pre&s;umes to believe. There is &s;carce any man but has found him&s;elf able, at the in&s;tigation of nece&s;&s;ity, to do what in a &s;tate of lei&s;ure and deliber|ation he would have concluded impo&s;&s;ible; and &s;ome of our &s;pecies have &s;ignalized them&s;elves by &s;uch atchievements, as prove there are few things above human hope.</P>
<P>It has been the policy of all nations to pre&s;erve, by &s;ome public monuments, the memory of tho&s;e who have &s;erved their country by great exploits: there is the &s;ame rea&s;on for continuing or reviving the names of tho&s;e who&s;e exten&s;ive abilities have dignified humanity.

none &s;eem to have been more exalted above the common rate of humanity, than the man known about two centuries ago by the appellation of the Admirable CRICHTON; of who&s;e hi&s;tory, whatever we may &s;uppre&s;s as &s;urpa&s;&s;ing credibility, yet we &s;hall, upon inconte&s;tible authority, relate enough to rank him among prodigies.</P>
<P>Virtue, &s;ays <HI>Virgil,</HI> is better accepted when it comes in a plea&s;ing form. The per&s;on of <HI>Crichton</HI> was eminently beautiful; but his beauty was con|&s;i&s;tent with &s;uch activity and &s;trength, that in fenc|ing he would &s;pring at one bound the length of twenty feet upon his antagoni&s;t; and he u&s;ed the &s;word in either hand with &s;uch force and dexterity, that &s;carce any one had courage to engage him.</P>
<P>Having &s;tudied at St. <HI>Andrews,</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> he went to <HI>Paris</HI> in his twenty-fir&s;t year, and affixed on the gate of the college of <HI>Navarre,</HI> a kind of challenge to the learned of that univer&s;ity, to di&s;pute with them on a certain day; offering to his opponents, whoever they might be, the choice of ten languages, and of all the faculties and &s;ciences. On the day pointed, three thou&s;and auditors a&s;&s;embled, when four doctors of the church, and fifty ma&s;ters appeared again&s;t him; and one of his antagoni&s;ts confe&s;&s;es that the doctors were defeated; that he gave proofs of knowledge above the reach of man; and that an hundred years pa&s;&s;ed without food or &s;leep would not be &s;ufficient for the attainment of his learning. After a di&s;putation of nine hours, he was pre&s;ented by the pre&s;ident and and profe&s;&s;ors with a diamond and pur&s;e of gold, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with repeated ac|clamations.</P>
<P>From <HI>Paris</HI> he went to <HI>Rome,</HI> where he made the &s;ame challenge, and had in the pre&s;ence of the Pope and Cardinals the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s. Afterwards he con|tracted at <HI>Venice</HI> an acquaintance with <HI>Aldus Manutius,</HI> by whom he was introduced to the learned of that city; he then vi&s;ited <HI>Padua,</HI> where he engaged in another public di&s;putation, beginning his perform|ance

<P>He afterwords publi&s;hed another challenge, in which he declared him&s;elf ready to detect the errors of <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> and all his commentators, either in the common forms of logic, or in any which his antago|ni&s;ts &s;hould propo&s;e, of an hundred different kinds of ver&s;e.</P>
<P>The&s;e acqui&s;itions of learning, however &s;tupen|dous, were not gained at the expence of any plea|&s;ure which youth generally indulges, or by the omi&s;|&s;ion of any accompli&s;hment in which it becomes a gentleman to excel: he practi&s;ed in great perfection the arts of drawing and painting; he was an emi|nent performer in both vocal and in&s;trumental mu|&s;ic; he danced with uncommon gracefulne&s;s; and on the day after his di&s;putation at <HI>Paris,</HI> exhibited his &s;kill in hor&s;eman&s;hip before the court of <HI>France,</HI> where, at a public match of tilting, he bore away the ring upon his lance fifteen times together.</P>
<P>He excelled likewi&s;e in dome&s;tic games of le&s;s dig|nity and reputation; and in the interval between his challenge and di&s;putation at <HI>Paris,</HI> he &s;pent &s;o much of his time at cards, dice, and tennis, that a lampoon was fixed upon the gate of the <HI>Sorbonne,</HI> directing tho&s;e who would fee this mon&s;ter of erudi|tion, to look for him at the tavern.</P>
<P>So exten&s;ive was his acquaintance with life and manners, that in an <HI>Italian</HI> comedy, compo&s;ed by him&s;elf, and exhibited before the court of <HI>Mantua,</HI> he is &s;aid to have per&s;onated fifteen different cha|racters, in all which he might &s;ucceed without great difficulty; &s;ince he had &s;uch power of retention, that once hearing an oration of an hour, he would repeat it exactly, and in the recital follow the &s;peak or through all the variety of tone and ge&s;ticulation.</P>
<P>Nor was his &s;kill in arms le&s;s than in learning, or
<PB N="267" REF="032623_0266_0FF3F3D4D4F98D78">
his courage inferior to his &s;kill. There was a prize-fighter at <HI>Mantua,</HI> who, (travelling about the world, according to the barbarous cu&s;tom of that age, as a general challenger) had defeated the mo&s;t celebra|ted ma&s;ters in many parts of Europe; and in <HI>Mantua,</HI> where he then re&s;ided, had killed three who appear|ed again&s;t him. The Duke repented that he had granted him his protection; when <HI>Crichton,</HI> looking on his &s;anguinary &s;ucce&s;s with indignation, offered to &s;take fifteen hundred pi&s;toles, and mount the &s;tage again&s;t him. The Duke with &s;ome reluctance con&s;ented; and on the day fixed, the combatants appeared: their weapons &s;eemed to have been the &s;ingle rapier, which was then newly introduced into <HI>Italy.</HI> The prize-fighter advanced with great vio|lence and fiercene&s;s, while <HI>Crichton</HI> contented him&s;elf calmly to ward off his pa&s;&s;es, and &s;uffered him to exhau&s;t his vigour by his own fury. <HI>Crichton</HI> then became the a&s;&s;ailant; and pre&s;&s;ed upon him with &s;uch force and agility, that he thru&s;t him thrice through the body, and &s;aw him expire. He then divided the prize he had won, among the widows who&s;e hu&s;bands had been killed.</P>
<P>The death of this wonderful man I &s;hould be wil|ling to conceal, did I not know that every reader will inquire curiou&s;ly after that fatal hour, which is common to all human beings, however di&s;tingui&s;hed from each other by nature or fortune.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Mantua</HI> having received &s;o many proofs of his various merit, made him tutor to his &s;on <HI>Vincentia de Conzaga,</HI> a prince of loo&s;e manners and turbulent di&s;po&s;ition. On this occa&s;ion it was that he compo&s;ed the comedy in which he exhibited &s;o many different characters with exact propriety. But his honor was of &s;hort continuance; for as he was one night in time of <HI>carnival</HI> rambling about the &s;treets with his guitar in his hand, he was attacked by &s;ix men ma&s;ked. Neither his courage nor &s;kill at this exigence de&s;erted him; he oppo&s;ed them with
<PB N="268" REF="032623_0267_0FF3F3D7B2A98B20">
&s;uch activity and &s;pirit, that he &s;oon di&s;per&s;ed them, and di&s;armed their leader, who throwing off his ma&s;k, di&s;covered him&s;elf to be the prince his pupil. <HI>Crichton,</HI> falling on his knees, took his own &s;word by the point, and pre&s;ented it to the prince; who immediately &s;eized it, and in&s;tigated, as &s;ome &s;ay, by jealou&s;y, according to others, only by drunken fury and brutal re&s;entment, ba&s;ely thru&s;t him through the heart.</P>
<P>Thus was the Admirable <HI>Crichton</HI> brought into that &s;tate in which he could excel the meane&s;t of mankind only by a few empty honours paid to his memory. The court of <HI>Mantua</HI> te&s;tified their e&s;teem by public mourning; the cotemporary wits were profu&s;e of their encomiums; and the palaces of <HI>Italy</HI> were adorned with pictures, repre&s;enting him on hor&s;eback, with a lance in one hand, and a book in the other.</P>

<L>Unpractis'd he to fawn, or &s;eek for pow'r,</L>
<L>By doctrines fa&s;hion'd to the varying hour;</L>
<L>Far other aims his heart had learn'd to prize,</L>
<L>More &s;kill'd to rai&s;e the wretched than to ri&s;e.</L>
<L>His hou&s;e was known to all the vagrant train,</L>
<L>He chid their wand'rings, but reliev'd their pain.</L>
<L>The long remember'd beggar was his gue&s;t,</L>
