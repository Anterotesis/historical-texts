<HEAD><HI>Solomon</HI> and <HI>Hiram;</HI> or Jews and Gentiles uni|ted, in building the Church of God.</HEAD>
<P>AS a chri&s;tian mini&s;ter invited to addre&s;s you on this occa|&s;ion, allow me to a&s;k your con&s;ideration to &s;ome important truths, which by the divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance will be &s;ugge&s;ted for your moral and religious improvement, from that pa&s;&s;age of the in&s;pired writings, recorded,
<Q><BIBL><HI>1 KINGS, v.12.</HI></BIBL>
<P>And the Lord gave Solomon wi&s;dom, as he pro|mi&s;ed him: and there was peace between <HI>Hiram</HI> and <HI>Solomon,</HI> and they two made a league to|gether.</P></Q></P>
<P>THESE words call our attention to an im|portant period in the ancient hi&s;tory of the providence of God, towards the church and world. What is humbly propo&s;ed by the prea|cher, is to offer &s;ome preliminary ob&s;ervations to elucidate the part of &s;acred hi&s;tory, with which the words now read, have a connection,&mdash;and
<PB N="6" REF="028998_0005_0FDEA3D15D45E198">
from the example the happy peace and mutual friend&s;hip and e&s;teem, which exi&s;ted between the ancient monarchs Solomon and Hiram, to ex|plain the nature and recommend the obligations of brotherly love&mdash;and to make &s;uch application, as may be &s;uitable to the &s;ubject and occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>That the knowledge of the one true God, the creator of the univer&s;e, and of his will to mankind as the rule of duty, might not be lo&s;t amid&s;t the moral darkne&s;s and polythei&s;m which over&s;pread the nations of the earth; it had plea&s;|ed God to &s;elect the numerous de&s;cendants of the patriarch Abraham, to be the depo&s;itary of this &s;acred betru&s;tment.</P>
<P>A &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of enlightened leaders under the divine direction, had conducted the nation of I&s;rael, through perils from &s;urrounding enemies, whom God had commanded them to extirpate, as unworthy longer to live, and planted them in peace and happine&s;s, in the promi&s;ed land.</P>
<P>Among tho&s;e heroes and &s;ervants of the Mo&s;t High, David the father of Solomon, &s;hone with di&s;tingui&s;hed lu&s;tre, as a pious patriot, and an accompli&s;hed &s;oldier. His victorious arms had &s;ubdued the nations all around the borders of Pale&s;tine. To his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, he left the peacea|ble po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an exten&s;ive kingdom, bounded by the Euphrates&mdash;by Arabia&mdash;by the Mediter|ranean&mdash;by Egypt, and by Tyre.</P>
<P>Solomon was worthy in all re&s;pects, to &s;ucceed &s;o illu&s;trious a father, and to a&s;cend the throne of a powerful kingdom.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="028998_0006_0FDEA3D490F10170">Tributary nations were to be held in &s;ubjec|tion, factions to be cru&s;hed, and the people long habituated to bloody wars, and the triumphs of victory, to be formed to peaceable and indu&s;|trious citizens; and the civil polity and eccle&s;i|a&s;tic government, required an arrangement ac|commodated to the new order of things.</P>
<P>In &s;o critical a &s;ituation the young monarch needed wi&s;dom, to pre&s;ide with dignity, and be a ble&s;&s;ing to his people. "And gave him wi&s;dom as he promi&s;ed him." As the many &s;ignal in|terpo&s;itions of heaven, in favor of the nation of I&s;rael were intended principally with a view to the pre&s;ervation of the true religion, it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary that there &s;hould be a common center of union; and Jeru&s;alem was cho&s;en. And at that early period, when men were le&s;s accu&s;tom|ed to the labor of rational inve&s;tigation of divine truths, and mo&s;t &s;truck with the glare of &s;en&s;i|ble objects, that the place and rites of their reli|gious homage, &s;hould be magnificent and &s;plen|did.</P>
<P>The great Jehovah, ever conde&s;cendent to the wants and weakne&s;s of his creatures, command|ed Solomon to build him a hou&s;e, for the mani|fe&s;tation of his glorious vi&s;ible pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>The building aro&s;e, and the world admired the richne&s;s and &s;plendor of the &s;tructure, the earthly palace, and throne of the God of I&s;rael. It corre&s;ponded to the great idea of Solomon, the pattern of which had been divinely com|municated. With pious joy, he contemplated the dome, and con&s;ecrated it to God. He a&s;ked
<PB N="8" REF="028998_0007_0FDEA3D8DE471170">
wi&s;dom, and God gave him wi&s;dom. His uncom|mon wi&s;dom appears in the &s;alutary maxims and laws, and the orderly and equitable admini&s;tra|tion of his government; attended with a long, peaceable and glorious reign; but principally in his ardent piety to God, and righteou&s;ne&s;s to men.</P>
<P>His natural genius was &s;et off to great ad|vantage by early piety. When young and ten|der his parents taught him the le&s;&s;ons of wi&s;dom and virtue. His early in&s;truction was watered with heavenly grace. His manners were adorn|ed with the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed education that a royal court could give, and where the &s;impli|city of piety and virtue, and every manly virtue dwelt. God was plea&s;ed to give him a wi&s;dom more than human in government, and in the arts and &s;ciences, and in &s;ubjects of philo&s;ophy and theology, and que&s;tions agitated in his day; and which the wi&s;e&s;t of his cotemporaries could not explain.</P>
<P>Egypt had long been celebrated as the &s;chool of &s;cience; but Solomon excelled her wi&s;e&s;t philo&s;ophers, Heman and Ethan, Calcol and Darda. Monarchs heard the &s;ame of his wi&s;|dom, and came to be in&s;tructed, or honored his court by &s;plendid emba&s;&s;ies. Among the&s;e is particularly mentioned the illu&s;trious queen of Sheba, now the ancient kingdom of Aby&s;inia, in the interior parts of Africa. The people there &s;till ob&s;erve many jewi&s;h rites in their religious wor&s;hip; and their monarchs boa&s;t their de&s;cent from that celebrated queen. The city and kingdom of Tyre bordered upon I&s;rael; and Hi|ram
<PB N="9" REF="028998_0008_0FDEA3DA60F9AE50">
a wi&s;e and religious monarch, &s;at upon the throne. He had been the friend and ally of the father of Solomon, and upon the acce&s;&s;ion of the &s;on, he &s;ent to congratulate him. Hiram, tho' king over an idolatrous people, yet acknowledg|es, and wor&s;hips the true God. Probably he was one of the numerous Gentile pro&s;elytes who received the knowledge of God from the Jews. And from the &s;ame &s;ource are derived, tho&s;e right notions of God and duty, which are found in the writings of the philo&s;ophers of Greece and Rome; and which are much extoled by modern infidels, while they affect to de&s;pi&s;e the divine fountain, from which they were derived. The &s;ouls of the&s;e two monarchs were formed for mutual friend&s;hip and e&s;teem. Hiram was the lover of David, and the friend and lover of his &s;on. And there was peace between them. He in who&s;e hands are the hearts of kings, brought this about, to accompli&s;h the purpo&s;es of his mercy to the church and world. The friend&s;hip and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Hiram was nece&s;&s;ary to Solomon, to accompli&s;h the va&s;t work a&s;&s;ign|ed him. Neighbouring kings are u&s;ually ho&s;tile, becau&s;e they &s;tand in the way of each other's de|&s;igns of worldly grandeur. But tho&s;e two royal brothers po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ouls too great and good to embrace the little and unju&s;t projects of kings.</P>
<P>Solomon was the friend of Hiram through life, and found him worthy of his regard. And probably had him in view, when he penned that excellent proverb, worthy of perpetual remem|brance, "Thine own friend and thy father's friend, for&s;ake not."</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="028998_0009_0FDEA3DCA7AD6110">Tyre lay upon the Mediterranean &s;ea, and was the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing trading city in the world. Navigation and commerce, of which they were the inventors, elevated them to great opulence and power. They were the fir&s;t who carried the art of &s;hip building to any degree of perfection, and navigated to foreign climes. Though ignorant of the polar properties of the magnet, and guided only by the &s;tars and &s;hores, yet were they very adventurous arid enterpri|zing. They had e&s;tabli&s;hed a regular commerce to the Ea&s;t Indies by the Red &s;ea, and to the &s;treights of Gibraltar. They were the mart of nations&mdash;the crowning city, who&s;e merchants were princes, and the honorable of the earth. By their wealth and indu&s;try they had arrived at the heighth of excellence, in the various arts which embelli&s;hed life, and particularly in archi|tecture.</P>
<P>Solomon reque&s;ted Hiram to &s;end him &s;ome of his architects, and acknowledges their &s;kill in building, and all mechanic arts to be greatly &s;uperior to his own people. And the Tyrian monarch mo&s;t readily complied with his de&s;ire.</P>
<P>The magnificent temple of Jehovah was eight years in building. Two hundred thou&s;and Jews and Tyrians labored in the work. Precious marbles were &s;ought for among the quarries, and hewed and poli&s;hed with the nice&s;t art; and Lebanon furni&s;hed the choice&s;t timber. Jews and Gentiles in perfect harmony, built the hou&s;e of God. Lively emblem of the go&s;pel church, built up by nations of all languages, where char|ity is the bond of perfection and peace.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="028998_0010_0FDEA3E5E4E309F8">The temple was erected three thou&s;and years from the creation, and a thou&s;and before the incarnation.</P>
<P>To teach us that perfection is not the lot of mortality, the fall of the wi&s;e and good Solomon is recorded. He aro&s;e glorious, as the &s;un after a night of &s;torms, and long continued his joyful cour&s;e: but a dark cloud ob&s;cured his beams, from which however, through the divine mercy he emerged, and bitterly laments his folly in the pur&s;uits of happine&s;s, in the gaiety and gran|deurs of life, and plea&s;ures of &s;en&s;e; pronoun|cing vanity and vexation upon them. His mar|riage with the daughter of Pharaoh, then the mo&s;t powerful monarch of the Ea&s;t, and with other wives taken from the royal courts of neighbouring princes, though &s;teps of policy to &s;ecure the peace and glory of his reign, yet were the unhappy occa&s;ion of plunging him into idol|atry and mi&s;ery. For this, and the &s;in of poliga|my, once &s;uffered for the hardne&s;s of men's hearts, though a violation of the original in&s;titu|tion; Solomon and the nation were &s;everely puni&s;hed, by the rebellion of his children, and the in&s;urrection of his &s;ubjects, and the divi&s;ion of the kingdom. God the &s;upreme governor of nations, pro&s;pers a people who obey his immuta|table laws, but frowns upon and ca&s;ts off tho&s;e who de&s;pi&s;e his authority.</P>
<P>While on this part of &s;acred hi&s;tory, &s;uffer me to add, what is mo&s;t worthy of our &s;olemn con&s;ideration, as individuals, and as members of the great community; That <HI>prevailing wicked|ne&s;s,
<PB N="12" REF="028998_0011_0FDEA3E893C3C0E0">
the effect of great worldly pro&s;perty and of hu|man depravity, are the alone cau&s;e of the de&s;olation and ruin of a people.</HI></P>
<P>Where is now Jeru&s;alem, the holy city and the holy temples, the admiration of ages? Where is Tyre the opulent, the mart of nations? Lo, the bo&s;om of de&s;truction hath pa&s;&s;ed over them! Behold, the beloved city trodden down by the Gentiles! Barbarous Turks and Saracens po&s;&s;e&s;s the once fertile land, the glorious holy mount, and theatre of God's wonderous works in for|mer ages,&mdash;the birth place of the divine Savi|our;&mdash;that witne&s;&s;ed his miracles&mdash;that heard his &s;ublime and heavenly di&s;cour&s;es&mdash;that &s;aw him expire without the gates, upon the cro&s;s, to make atonement and reconciliation&mdash;that beheld his glorious re&s;urrection, and triumphant tran&s;|lation to the cele&s;tial regions, and from whence the glad tidings of &s;alvation have gone forth into all lands. But now alas, it &s;uffers the cur&s;e of barrenne&s;s and barbarians, for the wickedne&s;s of them who once dwelt therein. And in its pre|&s;ent de&s;olation it will remain, until the times of the Gentiles is fulfilled. But glorious things are &s;poken of thee, O Jeru&s;alem, thou city of the living God! of which we wait for the accom|pli&s;hment, when the daughters al&s;o of Tyre &s;hall be there, and nations come to thy light, and kings to the brightne&s;s of thy ri&s;ing.</P>
<P>For &s;ome wonderful de&s;igns of providence, the people of the Hebrews are continued as a remark|able exception from all other people, &s;eparated and unmixed, tho' mixed and &s;cattered, over the earth, and aliens among the nations. Times
<PB N="13" REF="028998_0012_0FDEA3EA1798A258">
and &s;ea&s;ons are in the hands of God, who&s;e wonder working providence will accompli&s;h the purpo&s;es of his righteou&s;ne&s;s, in due time. Some great events relative to the church and the world, we are ready to conjecture, art about to take place, from the pre&s;ent unprecedented convul|&s;ions, amazement and revolutions, among the nations of the earth.
<Q>Ha&s;ten, O Lord, thy works of grace in this di&s;ordered world&punc; in the mid&s;t of the years make known thy mer|cy! We will wait for thy &s;alvation, O Lord.</Q></P>
<P>Sin has al&s;o overthrown the once famous city Tyre. Extreme opulence, the fruit of their ex|ten&s;ive commerce, abu&s;ed to promote the vices of luxury, pride, effeminacy and oppre&s;&s;ion, brought upon them perpetual de&s;olation.</P>
<P>Tyre was an i&s;land adjoining the continent.
<Q>They &s;hall, &s;ays the prophet Ezekiel, de&s;troy the walls of Tyre, and break down her tow|ers; I will al&s;o &s;crape her du&s;t from her, and make her like the top of a rock. It &s;hall be a place for the &s;preading of nets, in the mid&s;t of the &s;ea, and it &s;hall become a &s;poil to the na|tions.</Q>
The pre&s;ent &s;tate of Tyre remarkably verifies this ancient prediction. As you &s;ail a|long the de&s;olate coa&s;t, you &s;ee a few &s;cattering huts, and poor fi&s;hermen &s;preading their nets up|on the &s;un burnt rocks and ruins, or hauling them to the &s;hores. Let us, &s;irs, guard again&s;t tho&s;e private and public &s;ins and vices, which have drawn down judgments upon a &s;inful peo|ple, and let us love and practice that univer&s;al righteou&s;ne&s;s and virtue, which exalteth a na|tion.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="14" REF="028998_0013_0FDEA3EB9B408448">2. From the example of that happy peace, and mutual friend&s;hip and e&s;teem, which exi&s;ted between King Solomon and Hiram, I &s;hall take occa&s;ion to <HI>explain the nature, and recommend the obligations of brotherly love.</HI> There was peace be|tween them, and they two made a league to|gether.</P>
<P>How good and plea&s;ant is it for brethren to dwell in unity together! Where mutual brother|ly love reigns in a &s;ociety, there peace, content|ment and every moral and &s;ocial virtue dwell. Where hatred reigns, the bands of &s;ociety are bur&s;t a&s;under, the fire brands and arrows of con|tention are &s;cattered around, and death with gha&s;t|ly &s;miles &s;its upon the ruins. But love cements mankind together, as brethren, and &s;ociety is as a &s;trong and beautiful edifice.</P>
<P>Mankind are made for &s;ociety. It is not good for man to be alone. And virtuous friend&s;hip is the foundation on which &s;ociety re&s;ts.</P>

<P>The obligations of brotherly love, charity and kindne&s;s, are derived from the mutual depen|dence of mankind, for the pre&s;ervation of life and the acqui&s;ition of the means of a comforta|ble exi&s;tence. Man is weak and wretched in &s;olitude, but powerful and happy in &s;ociety.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="028998_0014_0FDEA3EFF6780FB0">This mutual love in our &s;ocial &s;tate, the chri&s;|tian's ma&s;ter and Lord, hath taught us to put into practice, from higher con&s;iderations than meer humane principles, even from love to God, and to the Redeemer of men; that we &s;hould love our fellow men, as the creatures of God and children of our univer&s;al father.</P>
<P>The divine law which commands us to love our neighbour as our&s;elves, and to do to others as we would that others &s;hould do to us, is a mo&s;t &s;afe, di&s;intere&s;ted and benevolent rule; intelligi|ble to every capacity, and calculated for our dai|ly u&s;e.</P>
<P>Chri&s;tianity teaches us that with the &s;ame &s;incerity and zeal, with which we pur&s;ue our own intere&s;t and happine&s;s, we &s;hould pur&s;ue al&s;o that of our fellow men. Our own &s;elf-love is made the rule and &s;quare of our love to others.</P>
<P>Do we enter zealou&s;ly into the defence of our reputation from the tongue of &s;lander, and e&s;tab|li&s;h our innocency, through love to our&s;elves? With the &s;ame zeal, are we to vindicate the reputation of others. Do we overlook and par|don our own infirmities through love to our|&s;elves? So &s;hould we overlook and pardon the infirmities and failings of our fellow men, through love to them. Do we labour to enjoy peace and comfort in this life, and to &s;ecure im|mortal happine&s;s beyond the grave? With the &s;ame &s;incerity and zeal &s;hould we labor to pro|mote the temporal and eternal happine&s;s of our fellow men.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="028998_0015_0FDEA3F562FA6C08">In the&s;e things e&s;&s;entially con&s;i&s;ts genuine brotherly love, upon evangelic principles. O, &s;irs, what happine&s;s would en&s;ue were this di|vine law in univer&s;al practice! Of this law, the divine philanthropi&s;t, who came down from heaven to unite him&s;elf to us, as our elder bro|ther, has given us the illu&s;trious example. <HI>Bre|thren, if God hath thus loved us, we ought to love me another.</HI></P>
<P>"Ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer, in&s;pire our &s;ouls with a portion of that cele&s;tial charity which thou ha&s;t &s;hewn for us!" Then would univer&s;al gladne&s;s abound, and peace and happine&s;s reign. All &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, fraud and violence cea&s;e; and ju&s;tice, charity and kindne&s;s prevail. Then would be realized the golden age, which ancient prophets have foretold, and poets often &s;ung.</P>
<P>The wi&s;e author of our exi&s;tence has here pla|ced us in &s;uch a condition, that our many and various connections and dependencies, may give us abundant opportunities and occa&s;ions, for the exerci&s;e of the moral and &s;ocial virtues; that our life may be filled up with u&s;efulne&s;s, and our character as men and chri&s;tians, &s;upported with reputation. And by divine grace a&s;&s;i&s;ting, we may be preparing for a more perfect &s;ociety in the regions of immortality, where the univer&s;al principle is, mutual love.</P>
<P>Let it be our daily care to cultivate this mo&s;t worthy principle, &s;ince it lives and reigns in that pure cele&s;tial &s;ociety, to which the wi&s;e and good only are united, and where no malevolent, envi|ous or unmerciful di&s;po&s;ition, will be admitted.
<PB N="17" REF="028998_0016_0FDEA3F6E83C00C8">
A pre&s;ent reward attends the exerci&s;e of charity. It relieves and comforts the mind. A generous mind feels more plea&s;ure in doing a kindne&s;s, than receiving one. It is, &s;ays our Lord, more ble&s;&s;ed to give than to receive. He who gives you an opportunity to do good is your benefac|tor. And he who be&s;tows a needed charity is more obliged, than he who receives. To do good then, &s;irs, and to communicate forget not, for with &s;uch &s;acrifices God is well plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>What &s;acred plea&s;ure does the generous brea&s;t feel, who by &s;ympathy and kindne&s;s, dries up the tears of angui&s;h, and drives before him mourning and woe, and lights up joy and glad|ne&s;s in the heart oppre&s;&s;ed with grief? It is as the &s;erene light of the morning, ari&s;ing upon the weary and lo&s;t traveller, or the &s;hipwrecked mar|iner, after a night of &s;torms and darkne&s;s. Ble&s;|&s;ed are the merciful, for they &s;hall find mercy.</P>
<P><HI>Some Reflections will conclude.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. My brethren, let grateful &s;entiments ari&s;e to God, by who&s;e di&s;po&s;ing providence, we are placed in that favorable condition, in which we may enjoy all the profits and plea&s;ures, of the &s;ocial and friendly connections, which con&s;i&s;t with this &s;tate of our mortality. We live in a land of quietne&s;s and plenty, and heaven &s;howers down upon us, innumerable mercies, temporal and &s;piritual.</P>
<P>Let us improve them to glorify our father in heaven, in the ways of piety and benevolence, and to do good to mankind by the u&s;efulne&s;s of
<PB N="18" REF="028998_0017_0FDEA3F87968F5E0">
our lives. And may we e&s;cape tho&s;e evils which an ungrateful abu&s;e of the divine mercies bring upon men.</P>
<P N="2">2. Our &s;ubject pre&s;ents to every &s;ocial in&s;ti|tution, as well as to individuals, the &s;acred obli|gations of brotherly love.</P>
<P>The &s;ociety now to be formed, profe&s;&s;es this, as the ground of their in&s;titution. And to take as their pattern in peace and &s;ocial affection, the two royal brothers and ma&s;ter builders, Hi|ram and Solomon. Between them there was peace, <HI>and they two made a league together.</HI> A treaty of national friend&s;hip and alliance and of a free trade and commerce, was probably formed and ratified, for the mutual benefit of Judea and Tyre; and a per&s;onal friend&s;hip and corre&s;pon|dence al&s;o e&s;tabli&s;hed, between the two mon|archs.</P>
<P>An in&s;titution founded for the promotion of mutual edification and brotherly love is u&s;eful and laudable. It appears from the hi&s;tory of operative ma&s;onry, that regular &s;ocieties or lodg|es, were formed in Europe in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. And the circum&s;tances which led to this originated from one of the mo&s;t wonderful events which the world had ever witne&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>After a long night of ignorance and moral darkne&s;s, had over&s;pread the nations, two or three millions of people in different cru&s;ades, led on by kings, princes and prie&s;ts, and armed with enthu&s;ia&s;tic ardor, marched from the ex|tremities

of Europe into A&s;ia, to recover the ho|ly city Jeru&s;alem from the hands of infidel Sar|acens. They performed prodigies of valor and violence, and with the lo&s;s of thou&s;ands of lives, got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Jeru&s;alem. In their progre&s;s they marched thro' Con&s;tantinople, then the capital of the Grecian or ea&s;tern Roman empire, where the arts and &s;ciences were &s;till cultivated. The Europeans were barbarians compared with the people of the Ea&s;t. They were a&s;toni&s;hed at the magnificence which they &s;aw every where; and e&s;pecially at the noble and magnificent build|ings, contra&s;ted with the thatched and &s;moaky huts, in which they lived in Europe. They were in&s;pired with a new ta&s;te for architecture. Skilful ma&s;ons and builders were invited from A&s;ia, and &s;plendid palaces, churches and edifi|ces aro&s;e, as it were by magic. The builders found the &s;ecrets of their art profitable. They became opulent and powerful. Kings and ba|rons were de&s;irous to be initiated into the my&s;|teries of the geometrical proportions of ma&s;on|ry and architecture, and were admitted. Oth|er &s;i&s;ter-mechanic arts at the &s;ame time aro&s;e, and held within them&s;elves the &s;ecrets or my&s;te|ries of their re&s;pective trades. And &s;omething of this cu&s;tom remains to the pre&s;ent day. We hence &s;ee a de&s;erved re&s;pect paid to a u&s;eful, me|chanical, ancient and honorable profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren and friends of this ancient and honor|able order:</HI></P>
<P>Accept a word addre&s;&s;ed to you, the dictate of benevolence, and an earne&s;t de&s;ire for your u&s;efulne&s;s and reputation in life, and happine&s;s beyond the grave.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="028998_0019_0FDEA403044F7460">For good and &s;ufficient rea&s;ons, a &s;ociety may retain within them&s;elves, the knowledge of &s;ome things, which would be an advantage neither to the world, or them&s;elves, to reveal. Man is naturally inqui&s;itive. He wi&s;hes to know every thing. It may be u&s;eful policy to keep alive this curio&s;ity. I pre&s;ume not to explain the my&s;teries, &s;o called, of ma&s;onry. And I &s;uppo&s;e I &s;hould not, if I knew them.</P>
<P>To diffu&s;e u&s;eful knowledge, and increa&s;e in wi&s;dom&mdash;to extend charity and relief to tho&s;e whom misfortunes have reduced&mdash;to cultivate the endearments of friend&s;hip and brotherly love &mdash;and to enjoy the innocent plea&s;ures of &s;ociety as a relaxation from the fatigues of bu&s;ine&s;s; I would charitably hope, are &s;ome of the mo&s;t im|portant &s;ecrets of your &s;ociety. The&s;e are things plea&s;ing and profitable. The public laws of your fraternity are good. They exclude the im|moral and vicious. They demand that your members be examplary in their lives and wor|thy citizens. They require more than this; even the acknowledgement and wor&s;hip of God, a belief in divine revelation and reverence for the in&s;titutions of our holy religion.</P>
<P>If you act up to your principles, the influence of your &s;ocial combinations will never be u&s;ed to &s;erve the intere&s;ts of a party; neither to &s;ow the &s;eeds of faction in the community, or to ad|vance to places of public tru&s;t, the unqualified. But while you pay the de&s;erved re&s;pect to the worthy of your own community, you will not exclude others, equally de&s;erving your confi|dence. In your individual and &s;ocial character&punc;
<PB N="21" REF="028998_0020_0FDEA404889115B0">
ever act with integrity and impartiality; and pur|&s;ue &s;uch a line of conduct as &s;hall &s;ilence the ob|jections of tho&s;e, who may expre&s;s their fears, that your &s;ociety may have an undue influence, in any re&s;pect. Act worthily as men and profe&s;|&s;ed ma&s;ons, and let me add as chri&s;tians. Fol|low peace with all men. And may a happy ru|ral &s;implicity of innocent and virtuous manners be ever characteri&s;tic of the members of the VILLAGE LODGE.</P>
<P>Though your laws do not admit into your fraternity, the fair and lovely daughters of Eve, becau&s;e the labors of the trowel were not inten|ded for them, and the <HI>lillies toil not</HI>; yet every true ma&s;on is by profe&s;&s;ion, the protector and friend of the virtuous fair. The emblematic badges of your orders, &s;trike the mind of an un|initiated brother as very &s;ignificant and happily de&s;igned.</P>
<P>Imitate, brethren the SUN, in the diffu&s;ion of goodne&s;s and u&s;eful knowledge all around you. He &s;hines upon the evil and the good, and &s;cat|ters joy and gladne&s;s wherever his light and heat come.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve the &s;hining STARS, their regular and harmonious revolutions. Like them be per&s;e|vering in all u&s;eful labor. Take the COMPASS of propriety of behaviour; the SQUARE of rect|itude, in all your conver&s;ation. The PLUM|LINE, and LEVEL of un&s;haken ju&s;tice. The SWORD of fortitude in duty, and the TROWEL of diligence in bu&s;ine&s;s, cementing all labor with brotherly love; and daub not with untempered

mortar, but be ambitious to excel in every no|ble and u&s;eful work. Let your life be uniform, like a fini&s;hed and well proportioned EDIFICE, &s;upported by the comely PILLARS of virtue, be|nevolence, truth and friend&s;hip. Let wi&s;dom and integrity be the ba&s;e, and charity the princi|ple; and &s;trength and beauty will adorn the &s;tructure.</P>
<P>Bear the HOD of patience in the nece&s;&s;ary la|bors and &s;ufferings of life, and a&s;cend the LAD|DER of honorable promotion, and be worthy of a &s;eat in SOLOMON's chair. And let the white and fair APRON, be truly &s;ignificant of your in|nocency and purity of character, and fidelity in all bu&s;ine&s;s. Take the HIVE of indu&s;trious bees, may you gather knowledge and virtue from the wide fields of nature and revelation, and your labors benefit others as well as your&s;elves. And in all your profe&s;&s;ions and actions, may the naked HEART, be de&s;criptive of your &s;incerity and brotherly love. And &s;ee the naked SWORD of ju&s;tice, pointed to puni&s;h all fal&s;ehood and wickedne&s;s there. Ever live under the &s;olemn, impre&s;&s;ive &s;en&s;e of the OMNISCIENT EYE of Jeho|vah, which &s;ees your &s;ecret thoughts, your pub|lic and private ways. O may you approve your|&s;elves to him, who is greater than your heart and knoweth all things.</P>
<P>As the glorious STAR guided the &s;ages of the Ea&s;t, to the infant Je&s;us, &s;o my the ble&s;&s;ed go&s;|pel, &s;ins, lead you to the divine Redeemer, our ARK of &s;afety. And may you &s;ecure the AN|CHOR of a good hope, and be &s;upported on the boi&s;terous &s;ea of life, and in the &s;torm of death.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="028998_0022_0FDEA40F6A6F9DF0">The&s;e moral and emblematic figures, re&s;pected friends, calling you to virtue and to God, re|ceive additional force from the &s;olemn &s;hroud and COFFIN, which terminate all earthly &s;cenes and remind you of the &s;hortne&s;s of your abode on earth.</P>
<P>May your remembrance live as the &s;prig of EVER-GREEN, when the gra&s;s growing over your graves &s;hall wave to the whi&s;pering winds! May you live and flouri&s;h in the bright climes of im|mortality!</P>
<P>It is God who forms us for &s;ocial joys, and gives us the ble&s;&s;ings of friend&s;hip. Let our in|nocent recreations, and convivial comforts, be con&s;ecrated to him.</P>
<P>May the love and fear of God, now and ever reign in all our hearts, that we offend not that high and holy being, who is the con&s;tant witne&s;s of all our &s;ecret purpo&s;es, and public ac|tions, and will be our righteous Judge. To whom be a&s;cribed dominion, &s;alvation and glory, now and evermore.</P>
