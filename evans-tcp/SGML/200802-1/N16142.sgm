<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE yielded with diffidence to the &s;o|licitations of the Principal of the Academy, in undertaking to expre&s;s my regard for the pro&s;perity of this Seminary of Learning, by &s;ubmitting to your candor, a few Thoughts upon Female Education.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t remark that I &s;hall make upon this &s;ubject, is, that female education &s;hould be accommodated to the &s;tate of &s;ociety, man|ners, and government of the country, in which it is conducted.</P>
<P>This remark leads me at once to add, that the education of young ladies, in this coun|try, &s;hould be conducted upon principles very different from what it is in Great Britain, and in &s;ome re&s;pects different from what it was when we were part of a monarchical empire.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal circum&s;tances in the &s;ituation, employments, and duties of women, in America, which require a peculiar mode of education.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="6" REF="020691_0005_0FB09CB384E806F8">I. The early marriages of our women, by contracting the time allowed for education, renders it nece&s;&s;ary to contract its plan, and to confine it chiefly to the more u&s;eful branch|es of literature.</P>
<P N="2">II. The &s;tate of property, in America, ren|ders it nece&s;&s;ary for the greate&s;t part of our citizens to employ them&s;elves, in different occupations, for the advancement of their fortunes. This cannot be done without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the female members of the com|munity. They mu&s;t be the &s;tewards, and guardians of their hu&s;bands' property. That education, therefore, will be mo&s;t proper for our women, which teaches them to di&s;charge the duties of tho&s;e offices with the mo&s;t &s;uc|ce&s;s and reputation.</P>
<P N="3">III. From the numerous avocations to which a profe&s;&s;ional life expo&s;es gentlemen in America from their families, a principal &s;hare of the in&s;truction of children naturally de|volves upon the women. It becomes us there|fore to prepare them by a &s;uitable education, for the di&s;charge of this mo&s;t important duty of mothers.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The equal &s;hare that every citizen has in the liberty, and the po&s;&s;ible &s;hare he may have in the government of our country, make
<PB N="7" REF="020691_0006_0FB09CB621ED1AB8">
it nece&s;&s;ary that our ladies &s;hould be qualified to a certain degree by a peculiar and &s;uitable education, to concur in in&s;tructing their &s;ons in the principles of liberty and government.</P>
<P N="5">V. In Great Britain the bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;ervants is a regular occupation; but in America this humble &s;tation is the u&s;ual retreat of un|expected indigence; hence the &s;ervants in this country po&s;&s;e&s;s le&s;s knowledge and &s;ub|ordination than are required from them; and hence, our ladies are obliged to attend more to the private affairs of their families, than ladies generally do, of the &s;ame rank in Great Britain. "They are good &s;ervants (&s;aid an American lady of di&s;tingui&s;hed merit <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mrs. GRAEME.</NOTE> in a letter to a favorite daughter) who will do well with good looking after." This cir|cum&s;tance &s;hould have great influence upon the nature and extent of female education in America.</P>
<P>The branches of literature mo&s;t e&s;&s;enti|al for a young lady in this country, appear to be,</P>
<P N="1">I. A knowledge of the Engli&s;h language. She &s;hould not only read, but &s;peak and &s;pell it correctly. And to enable her to do this, &s;he &s;hould be taught the Engli&s;h grammar, and
<PB N="8" REF="020691_0007_0FB09CB75A2DA130">
be frequently examined in applying its rules in common conver&s;ation.</P>
<P N="2">II. Plea&s;ure and intere&s;t con&s;pire to make the writing of a fair and legible hand, a nece&s;|&s;ary branch of female education. For this pur|po&s;e &s;he &s;hould be taught not only to &s;hape every letter properly, but to pay the &s;tricte&s;t regard to points and capitals<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> among per&s;ons of ta&s;te is to u&s;e a capital letter only for the fir&s;t word of a &s;entence, and for names of per&s;ons, places and months, and for the fir&s;t word of every line in poetry. The word &s;hould be &s;o &s;haped <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> a &s;traight line may be drawn between two lines. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> of the word in either of them</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I once heard of a man who profe&s;&s;ed to di&s;cover the temper and di&s;po&s;ition of per&s;ons by looking at their hand writing. Without enquiring into the probability of this &s;tory; I &s;hall only remark, that there is one thing in which all mankind agree upon this &s;ub|ject, and that is, in con&s;idering writing that is blotted, crooked, or illegible, as a mark of a vulgar education. I know of few things more rude or illiberal, than to obtrude a let|ter upon a per&s;on of rank or bu&s;ine&s;s, which cannot be ea&s;ily read. Peculiar care &s;hould be taken to avoid every kind of ambiguity and affectation in writing <HI>names.</HI> I have now a letter in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion upon bu&s;ine&s;s, from a gentleman of a liberal profe&s;&s;ion in a neigh|bouring &s;tate, which I am unable to an&s;wer,
<PB N="9" REF="020691_0008_0FB09D81A0F9AA68">
becau&s;e I cannot di&s;cover the name which is &s;ub&s;cribed to it. For obvious rea&s;ons I would recommend the writing of the fir&s;t or chri&s;tian name at full length, where it does not con&s;i&s;t of more than two &s;yllables. Ab|breviations of all kinds in letter-writing, which always denote either ha&s;te or carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, &s;hould likewi&s;e be avoided. I have only to add under this head, that the Italian and in|verted hands which are read with difficulty, are by no means accommodated to the active &s;tate of bu&s;ine&s;s in America, or to the &s;impli|city of the citizens of a republic.</P>
<P N="3">III. Some knowledge of figures and book|keeping is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to qualify a young lady for the duties which await her in this country. There are certain occupations in which &s;he may a&s;&s;i&s;t her hu&s;band with this knowledge; and &s;hould &s;he &s;urvive him, and agreeably to the cu&s;tom of our country be the executrix of his will, &s;he cannot fail of deri|ving immen&s;e advantages from it.</P>
<P N="4">IV. An acquaintance with geography and &s;ome in&s;truction in chronology will enable a young lady to read hi&s;tory, biography, and travels, with advantage; and thereby qualify her not only for a general intercour&s;e with the world, but, to be an agreeable companion for a &s;en&s;ible man. To the&s;e branches of know|ledge
<PB N="10" REF="020691_0009_0FB09D876697DE18">
may be added, in &s;ome in&s;tances, a ge|neral acquaintance with the fir&s;t principles of a&s;tronomy, and natural philo&s;ophy, particu|larly with &s;uch parts of them as are calculated to prevent &s;uper&s;tition, by explaining the cau&s;es, or obviating the effects of natural evil.</P>
<P N="5">V. Vocal mu&s;ic &s;hould never be neglected, in the education of a young lady, in this country. Be&s;ides preparing her to join in that part of public wor&s;hip which con&s;i&s;ts in p&s;almody, it will enable her to &s;oothe the cares of dome&s;tic life. The di&s;tre&s;s and vexation of a hu&s;band&mdash;the noi&s;e of a nur&s;ery, and, even, the &s;orrows that will &s;ometimes intrude into her own bo&s;om, may all be relieved by a &s;ong, where found and &s;entiment unite to act upon the mind. I hope it will not be thought foreign to this part of our &s;ubject to introduce a fact here, which has been &s;ugge&s;t|ed to me by my profe&s;&s;ion, and that is, that the exerci&s;e of the organs of the brea&s;t, by &s;inging, contributes very much to defend them from tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es to which our climate, and other cau&s;es, have of late expo&s;ed them.&mdash; Our German fellow-citizens are &s;eldom af|flicted with con&s;umptions, nor have I ever known but one in&s;tance of a &s;pitting of blood among them. This, I believe, is in part oc|ca&s;ioned by the &s;trength which their lungs ac|quire, by exerci&s;ing them frequently in vocal
<PB N="11" REF="020691_0010_0FB09D887995AF18">
mu&s;ic, for this con&s;titutes an e&s;&s;ential branch of their education. The mu&s;ic-ma&s;ter of our academy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. ADGATE.</NOTE> has furni&s;hed me with an ob&s;er|vation &s;till more in favor of this opinion. He informed me that, he had known &s;everal in&s;tances of per&s;ons who were &s;trongly di&s;|po&s;ed to the con&s;umption, who were re&s;tored to health, by the moderate exerci&s;e of their lungs in &s;inging.</P>
<P N="6">VI. DANCING is by no means an improper branch of education for an American lady. It promotes health, and renders the figure and motions of the body ea&s;y and agreeable. I anticipate the time when the re&s;ources of con|ver&s;ation &s;hall be &s;o far multiplied, that the amu&s;ement of dancing &s;hall be wholly confined to children. But in our pre&s;ent &s;tate of &s;oci|ety and knowledge, I conceive it to be an agreeable &s;ub&s;titute for the ignoble plea&s;ures of drinking, and gaming, in our a&s;&s;emblies of grown people.</P>
<P N="7">VII. The attention of our young ladies &s;hould be directed, as &s;oon as they are pre|pared for it, to the reading of hi&s;tory&mdash;tra|vels&mdash;poetry&mdash;and moral e&s;&s;ays. The&s;e &s;tu|dies are accommodated, in a peculiar manner, to the pre&s;ent &s;tate of &s;ociety in America, and when a reli&s;h is excited for them, in early life,
<PB N="12" REF="020691_0011_0FB09D8A2971E8B8">
they &s;ubdue that pa&s;&s;ion for reading novels, which &s;o generally prevails among the fair &s;ex. I cannot di&s;mi&s;s this &s;pecies of writing and reading without ob&s;erving, that the &s;ubjects of novels are by no means accommodated to our pre&s;ent manners. They hold up <HI>life,</HI> it is true, but it is not as yet <HI>life,</HI> in America. Our pa&s;|&s;ions have not as yet "over&s;tepped the mo|de&s;ty of nature," nor are they "torn to tat|ters," to u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ions of the poet, by extravagant love, jealou&s;y, ambition, or re|venge. As yet the intrigues of a Briti&s;h novel, are as foreign to our manners, as the refine|ments of A&s;iatic vice. Let it not be &s;aid, that the tales of di&s;tre&s;s, which fill modern no|vels, have a tendency to &s;often the female heart into acts of humanity. The fact is the rever&s;e of this. The abortive &s;ympathy which is excited by the recital of imaginary di&s;tre&s;s, blunts the heart to that which is real; and, hence, we &s;ometimes &s;ee in&s;tances of young ladies, who weep away a whole forenoon over the criminal &s;orrows of a fictitious Charlotte or Werter, turning with di&s;dain at two o'clock from the &s;ight of a beggar, who &s;olicits in fee|ble accents or &s;igns, a &s;mall portion only, of the crumbs which fall from their fathers' tables.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. It will be nece&s;&s;ary to connect all the&s;e branches of education with regular in|&s;truction in the chri&s;tian religion. For this
<PB N="13" REF="020691_0012_0FB09D8B6DED5300">
purpo&s;e the principles of the different &s;ects of chri&s;tians &s;hould be taught and explained, and our pupils &s;hould early be furni&s;hed with &s;ome of the mo&s;t &s;imple arguments in favour of the truth of chri&s;tianity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Baron Haller's letters to his daughter on the truths of the chri&s;tian religion, and Dr. Beatie's "evidences of the chri&s;tian religion briefly and plainly &s;tated" are excellent little tracts, and well adapted for this purpo&s;e.</NOTE>. A portion of the bible (of late improperly bani&s;hed from our &s;chool) &s;hould be read by them every day, and &s;uch que&s;tions &s;hould be a&s;ked, after reading it, as are calculated to imprint upon their minds the intere&s;ting &s;tories contained in it.</P>
<P>Rou&s;&s;eau has a&s;&s;erted that the great &s;ecret of education con&s;i&s;ts in "wa&s;ting the time of children profitably." There is &s;ome truth in this ob&s;ervation. I believe that we often im|pair their health, and weaken their capacities, by impo&s;ing &s;tudies upon them, which are not proportioned to their years. But this objec|tion does not apply to religious in&s;truction. There are certain &s;imple propo&s;itions in the chri&s;tian religion, that are &s;uited in a peculiar manner, to the infant &s;tate of rea&s;on and moral &s;en&s;ibility. A clergyman of long experience in the in&s;truction of youth<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">The Rev. Mr. NICHOLAS COLLIN, mini&s;ter of the Swedi&s;h church in Wicocoe.</NOTE> informed me, that he always found children acquired religious knowledge more ea&s;ily than knowledge upon
<PB N="14" REF="020691_0013_0FB09D8CE3ADFCC8">
other &s;ubjects; and that young girls acquired this kind of knowledge more readily than boys. The female brea&s;t is the natural &s;oil of chri&s;tianity; and while our women are taught to believe its doctrines, and obey its precepts, the wit of Voltaire, and the &s;tile of Boling|broke, will never be able to de&s;troy its influ|ence upon our citizens.</P>
<P>I cannot help remarking in this place, that chri&s;tianity exerts the mo&s;t friendly influence upon &s;cience, as well as upon the morals and manners of mankind. Whether this be oc|ca&s;ioned by the unity of truth, and the mu|tual a&s;&s;i&s;tance which truths upon different &s;ubjects afford each other, or whether the faculties of the mind be &s;harpened and cor|rected by embracing the truths of revelation, and thereby prepared to inve&s;tigate and per|ceive truths upon other &s;ubjects, I will not determine, but it is certain that the greate&s;t di&s;coveries in &s;cience have been made by chri&s;tian philo&s;ophers, and that there is the mo&s;t knowledge in tho&s;e countries where there is the mo&s;t chri&s;tianity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is true in a peculiar manner in the &s;cience of medicine. A young Scotch phy&s;ician of enterprizing talents, who conceived a high idea of the &s;tate of medicine in the ea&s;tern countries, &s;pent two years in enquiries after medical knowledge in Con&s;tantinople, and Grand Cairo. On his return to Britain he confe&s;&s;ed to an American phy&s;ician whom he met at Naples, that after all his re&s;earches and travels, he "had di&s;covered no|thing except a &s;ingle fact relative to the plague, that he thought worth re|membering or communicating." The &s;cience of medicine in China according to the accounts of De Halde is in as imperfect a &s;tate <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">mong the Indians of North America.</NOTE>. By knowledge I mean truth only; and by truth I mean the percepti|on
<PB N="15" REF="020691_0014_0FB09D8E996B00F8">
of things as they appear to the divine mind. If this remark be well founded, then tho&s;e philo&s;ophers who reject chri&s;tianity, and tho&s;e chri&s;tians, whether parents or &s;chool|ma&s;ters, who neglect the religious in&s;truction of their children and pupils, <HI>reject</HI> and <HI>neglect</HI> the mo&s;t effectual means of promoting know|ledge in our country.</P>
<P N="9">IX. If the mea&s;ures that have been recom|mended for in&s;piring our pupils with a &s;en&s;e of religious and moral obligation be adopted, the government of them will be ea&s;y and agreeable. I &s;hall only remark under this head, that <HI>&s;trictne&s;s</HI> of di&s;cipline will always render <HI>&s;everity</HI> unnece&s;&s;ary, and that there will be the mo&s;t in&s;truction in that &s;chool, where there is the mo&s;t order.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid nothing in favour of in&s;trumen|tal mu&s;ic as a branch of female education, becau&s;e I conceive it is by no means accom|modated to the pre&s;ent &s;tate of &s;ociety and manners in America. The price of mu&s;ical in&s;truments, and the extravagant fees demand|ed by the teachers of in&s;trumental mu&s;ic, form but a &s;mall part of my objections to it.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="020691_0015_0FB09D8FE422BF68">To perform well, upon a mu&s;ical in&s;tru|ment, requires much time and long practice. From two to four hours in a day, for three or four years, appropriated to mu&s;ic, are an immen&s;e deduction from that &s;hort period of time which is allowed by the peculiar circum|&s;tances of our country for the acqui&s;ition of the u&s;eful branches of literature that have been mentioned. How many u&s;eful ideas might be picked up in the&s;e hours from hi&s;|tory, philo&s;ophy, poetry, and the numerous moral e&s;&s;ays with which our language abounds, and how much more would the knowledge ac|quired upon the&s;e &s;ubjects add to the con&s;e|quence of a lady, with her hu&s;band and with &s;ociety, than the be&s;t performed pieces of mu|&s;ic upon a harp&s;ichord or a guittar! Of the many ladies whom we have known, who have &s;pent the mo&s;t important years of their lives, in learning to play upon in&s;truments of mu&s;ic, how few of them do we &s;ee amu&s;e them&s;elves or their friends with them, after they become mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of families! Their harp&s;ichords &s;erve only as &s;ide-boards for their parlours, and prove by their &s;ilence, that nece&s;&s;ity and circum&s;tances, will always prevail over fa&s;hion, and fal&s;e maxims of education.</P>
<P>Let it not be &s;uppo&s;ed from the&s;e ob&s;erva|tions that I am in&s;en&s;ible of the charms of in&s;trumental mu&s;ic, or that I wi&s;h to exclude
<PB N="17" REF="020691_0016_0FB09D94B11B03B0">
it from the education of a lady where a mu&s;ical ear irre&s;i&s;tably di&s;po&s;es to it, and affluence at the &s;ame time affords a pro&s;pect of &s;uch an ex|emption from the u&s;ual cares and duties of the mi&s;tre&s;s of a family, as will enable her to prac|ti&s;e it. The&s;e circum&s;tances form an excepti|on to the general conduct that &s;hould ari&s;e upon this &s;ubject, from the pre&s;ent &s;tate of &s;ociety and manners in America.</P>
<P>I beg leave further to bear a te&s;timony again&s;t the practice of making the French language a part of female education in America. In Britain where company and plea&s;ure are the principal bu&s;ine&s;s of ladies; where the nur&s;e|ry and the kitchen form no part of their care, and where a daily intercour&s;e is maintained with French-men and other foreigners who &s;peak the French language, a knowledge of it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. But the ca&s;e is wide|ly different in this country. Of the many la|dies who have applied to this language, how great a proportion of them have been hurried into the cares and duties of a family before they had acquired it; of tho&s;e who have ac|quired it, how few have retained it after they were married; and of the few who have re|tained it, how &s;eldom have they had occa&s;ion to &s;peak it, in the cour&s;e of their lives! It certainly comports more with female delicacy as well as the natural politene&s;s of the French
<PB N="18" REF="020691_0017_0FB09D96AE03B190">
nation, to make it nece&s;&s;ary for French-men to learn to &s;peak our language in order to conver&s;e with our ladies, than for our ladies to learn their language, in order to conver&s;e with them.</P>
<P>Let it not be &s;aid in defence of a know|ledge of the French language, that many ele|gant books are written in it. Tho&s;e of them that are truly valuable, are generally tran&s;la|ted; but, if this were not the ca&s;e, the Engli&s;h language certainly contains many more books of real utility and u&s;eful information than can be read, without neglecting other duties, by the daughter, or wife of an American citi|zen.</P>
<P>It is with reluctance that I object to draw|ing, as a branch of education for an American lady. To be the mi&s;tre&s;s of a family is one of the great ends of a woman's being, and while the peculiar &s;tate of &s;ociety in America impo&s;es this &s;tation &s;o early, and renders the duties of it &s;o numerous and difficult, I con|ceive that little time can be &s;pared for the acqui&s;ition of this elegant accompli&s;hment.</P>
<P>It is agreeable to ob&s;erve how differently modern writers, and the in&s;pired author of the proverbs, de&s;cribe a fine woman. The former confine their prai&s;es chiefly to per&s;o|nal
<PB N="19" REF="020691_0018_0FB09D98B0DF8538">
charms, and ornamental accompli&s;hments, while the latter celebrates only the virtues of a valuable mi&s;tre&s;s of a family, and a u&s;eful member of &s;ociety. The one is perfectly ac|quainted with all the fa&s;hionable languages of Europe; the other, "opens her mouth with wi&s;dom" and is perfectly acquainted with all the u&s;es of the needle, the di&s;taff, and the loom. The bu&s;ine&s;s of the one, is plea&s;ure; the plea&s;ure of the other, is bu&s;ine&s;s. The one is admired abroad; the other is honour|ed and beloved at home. "Her children ari&s;e up and call her ble&s;&s;ed, her hu&s;band al|&s;o, and he prai&s;eth her." There is no fame in the world equal to this; nor is there a note in mu&s;ic half &s;o delightful, as the re&s;pectful language with which a grateful &s;on or daughter perpetuates the memory of a &s;en&s;ible and af|fectionate mother.</P>
<P>It &s;hould not &s;urprize us that Briti&s;h cu&s;|toms, with re&s;pect to female education, have been tran&s;planted into our American &s;chools and families. We &s;ee marks of the &s;ame in|congruity, of time and place, in many other things. We behold our hou&s;es accommoda|ted to the climate of Great Britain, by ea&s;t|ern and we&s;tern directions. We behold our ladies panting in a heat of ninety degrees, under a hat and cu&s;hion, which were calcula|ted for the temperature of a Briti&s;h &s;ummer.
<PB N="20" REF="020691_0019_0FB09D99C0F861F0">
We behold our citizens condemned and pu|ni&s;hed by a criminal law, which was copied from a country where maturity in corruption renders public executions a part of the amu&s;e|ments of the nation. It is high time to awake from this &s;ervility&mdash;to &s;tudy our own cha|racter&mdash;to examine the age of our country&mdash; and to adopt manners in every thing, that &s;hall be accommodated to our &s;tate of &s;ociety, and to the forms of our government. In par|ticular it is incumbent upon us to make orna|mental accompli&s;hments, yield to principles and knowledge, in the education of our wo|men.</P>
<P>A philo&s;opher once &s;aid "let me make all the ballads of a country and I care not who makes its laws." He might with more pro|priety have &s;aid, let the ladies of a country be educated properly, and they will not only make and admini&s;ter its laws, but form its manners and character. It would require a lively imagination to de&s;cribe, or even to comprehend, the happine&s;s of a country, where knowledge and virtue, were generally diffu&s;ed among the female &s;ex. Our young men would then be re&s;trained from vice by the terror of being bani&s;hed from their com|pany. The loud laugh, and the malignant &s;mile, at the expence of innocence, or of per|&s;onal infirmities&mdash;the feats of &s;ucce&s;sful
<PB N="21" REF="020691_0020_0FB09D9B2C4B08F8">
mimickry&mdash;and the low priced wit, which is borrowed from a mi&s;application of &s;cripture phra&s;es, would no more be con&s;idered as re|commendations to the &s;ociety of the ladies. A double entendre, in their pre&s;ence, would then exclude a gentleman forever from the company of both &s;exes, and probably oblige him to &s;eek an a&s;ylum from contempt, in a foreign country. The influence of female education would be &s;till more exten&s;ive and u&s;eful in dome&s;tic life. The obligations of gentlemen to qualify them&s;elves by knowledge and indu&s;try to di&s;charge the duties of bene|volence, would be encrea&s;ed by marriage; and the patriot&mdash;the hero&mdash;and the legi&s;la|tor, would find the &s;weete&s;t reward of their toils, in the approbation and applau&s;e of their wives. Children would di&s;cover the marks of maternal prudence and wi&s;dom in every &s;tation of life; for it has been remarked that there have been few great or good men who have not been ble&s;&s;ed with wi&s;e and prudent mothers. Cyrus was taught to revere the gods, by his mother Mandane&mdash;Samuel was devoted to his prophetic office before he was born, by his mother Hannah&mdash;Con&s;tantine was re&s;cued from pagani&s;m by his mother Con&s;tantia&mdash;and Edward the &s;ixth inherited tho&s;e great and excel|lent qualities which made him the delight of the age in which he lived, from his mother, lady Jane Seymour. Many other in&s;tances might
<PB N="22" REF="020691_0021_0FB09D9CAC887788">
be mentioned, if nece&s;&s;ary, from ancient and modern hi&s;tory, to e&s;tabli&s;h the truth of this propo&s;ition.</P>
<P>I am not enthu&s;ia&s;tical upon the &s;ubject of education. In the ordinary cour&s;e of human affairs, we &s;hall probably too &s;oon follow the foot&s;teps of the nations of Europe in manners and vices. The fir&s;t marks we &s;hall perceive of our declen&s;ion, will appear among our wo|men. Their idlene&s;s, ignorance and profli|gacy will be the harbingers of our ruin. Then will the character and performance of a buf|foon on the theatre, be the &s;ubject of more conver&s;ation and prai&s;e, than the patriot or the mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel;&mdash;then will our lan|guage and pronunciation be enfeebled and cor|rupted by a flood of French and Italian words; &mdash;then will the hi&s;tory of romantic amours, be preferred to the immortal writings of Addi&s;on, Hawke&s;worth and John&s;on;&mdash;then will our churches be neglected, and the name of the &s;upreme being never be called upon, but in profane exclamations;&mdash;then will our Sundays be appropriated, only to fea&s;ts and concerts; &mdash;and then will begin all that train of dome&s;|tic and political calamities&mdash;But, I forbear. The pro&s;pect is &s;o painful, that I cannot help, &s;ilently, imploring the great arbiter of human affairs, to interpo&s;e his almighty goodne&s;s, and to deliver us from the&s;e evils, that, at lea&s;t one
<PB N="23" REF="020691_0022_0FB09D9F793825C8">
&s;pot of the earth may be re&s;erved as a monu|ment of the effects of good education, in order to &s;hew in &s;ome degree, what our &s;pecies was, before the fall, and what it &s;hall be, after its re&s;toration.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
<P>Thus, gentlemen, have I briefly fini&s;hed what I propo&s;ed. If I am wrong in tho&s;e opinions in which I have taken the liberty of departing from general and fa&s;hionable habits of thinking, I am &s;ure you will di&s;cover, and pardon my mi&s;takes. But, if I am right, I am equally &s;ure you will adopt my opinions; for to enlightened minds truth is alike acceptable, whether it comes from the lips of age, or the hand of antiquity, or whether it be obtruded by a per&s;on, who has no other claim to atten|tion, than a de&s;ire of adding to the &s;tock of hu|man happine&s;s.</P>
<P>I cannot di&s;mi&s;s the &s;ubject of female edu|cation without remarking, that the city of Phi|ladelphia fir&s;t &s;aw a number of gentlemen a&s;|&s;ociated for the purpo&s;e of directing the edu|cation of young ladies. By means of this plan, the power of teachers is regulated and re&s;trained, and the objects of education are extended. By the &s;eparation of the &s;exes in the unformed &s;tate of their manners, female delicacy is cheri&s;hed and pre&s;erved. Here the young ladies may enjoy all the literary advan|tages

Here emulation may be excited with|out jealou&s;y,&mdash;ambition without envy,&mdash;and competition without &s;trife.

Too much prai&s;e cannot be given to our principal and his a&s;&s;i&s;tants, for the abilities and fidelity with which they have carried the plan into ex|ecution. The proficiency which the young ladies have di&s;covered in reading&mdash;writing&mdash; &s;pelling&mdash;arithmetic&mdash;grammar&mdash;geography &mdash;mu&s;ic&mdash;and their different catechi&s;ms, &s;ince the la&s;t examination, is a le&s;s equivocal mark of the merit of our teachers, than any thing I am able to expre&s;s in their favour.</P>
<P>But the reputation of the academy mu&s;t be &s;u&s;pended, till the public are convinced, by the future conduct and character of our pupils, of the advantages of the in&s;titution. To you, therefore,
YOUNG LADIES,
an important problem is committed for &s;olu|tion;
<PB N="25" REF="020691_0024_0FB09DA487285238">
and that is, whether our pre&s;ent plan of education be a wi&s;e one, and whether it be cal|culated to prepare you for the duties of &s;ocial and dome&s;tic life. I know that the elevation of the female mind, by means of moral, phy&s;ical and religious truth, is con&s;idered by &s;ome men as unfriendly to the dome&s;tic character of a wo|man. But this is the prejudice of little minds, and &s;prings from the &s;ame &s;pirit which op|po&s;es the general diffu&s;ion of knowledge among the citizens of our republics. If men believe that ignorance is favourable to the govern|ment of the female &s;ex, they are certainly de|ceived; for a weak and ignorant woman will always be governed with the greate&s;t difficul|ty. I have &s;ometimes been led to a&s;cribe the invention of ridiculous and expen&s;ive fa&s;hions in female dre&s;s, entirely to the gen|tlemen<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The very expen&s;ive prints of female dre&s;&s;es which are publi&s;hed annu|ally in France, are invented and executed wholly by GENTLEMEN.</NOTE>, in order to divert the ladies from im|proving their minds, and thereby to &s;ecure a more arbitrary and unlimited authority over them. It will be in your power, LADIES, to correct the mi&s;takes and practice of our &s;ex up|on the&s;e &s;ubjects, by demon&s;trating, that the fe|male temper can only be governed by rea&s;on, and that the cultivation of rea&s;on in women, is alike friendly to the order of nature, and to private as well as public happine&s;s.</P>
