<Q>&mdash;<HI>The Government &s;hall be upon his Shoulder.</HI>&mdash;</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THE Kingdom of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t is of that Nature and Con|cernment to Mankind, that a Di&s;cour&s;e upon it can never be out of Sea&s;on: and, if I mi&s;|take not, it may very fitly be con&s;idered on this Occa&s;ion; when the Heads of our Tribes are met together in a &s;olemn A&s;&s;embly, to give Thanks to the God of Heaven, for the many great and di&s;tingui&s;hing Privileges, both civil
<PB N="2" REF="004321_0005_100454D718363630">
and religious, which we are favoured with; and to ask Direction and a Ble&s;&s;ing from on High, upon all the Admini&s;trations of Government in the Land; and e&s;pecially upon the important Affairs, which lye before the Great and Gene|ral A&s;&s;embly of the Province.</P>
<P>And agreeably I have cho&s;en the&s;e Words of the evangelical Prophet, as the Foundation for &s;uch a Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>And, to make the way clear, we may ob&s;erve, That in the <HI>&s;ixth</HI> and <HI>&s;eventh</HI> Ver&s;es of this Con|text, we have one of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious Pro|phe&s;ies concerning the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> that is to be met with in any Part of the Old Te&s;tament. For here, many hundred of Years before the Accom|pli&s;hment of it, the Prophet gives us a particu|lar Account of the Coming and Kingdom of Chri&s;t: and is as exact in the De&s;cription of his Per&s;on and Government, as if he had lived in the&s;e Go&s;pel Days, and &s;een the Fulfillment of his own Predictions.</P>
<P>And accordingly there are two things ob&s;er|vable in the Prophe&s;y.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, We have here a plain Prediction of the Incarnation and Humiliation of the Son of God, in theDi&s;charge of his mediatorial Undertaking. This the Prophet gives us in two Words; <HI>unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given.</HI> But as I have not time to explain the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages at pre|&s;ent; I mu&s;t go on to con&s;ider, <HI>the Glory that &s;hould follow</HI> upon the Aba&s;ement of the Son of God, and be the Reward of his Humiliation.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="004321_0006_10041263DED923F8">And therefore,</P>
<P>Secondly, We may further ob&s;erve a very clear Prediction of the glorious Exaltation of the Son of God, after his Birth and Sufferings in the hu|man Nature. And in this he is de&s;cribed both by his Name and Dominion.</P>
<P N="1">1. He was to have a Name given him above every Name. For &s;ays the Prophet, <HI>His Name &s;hall be called, Wonderful, Coun&s;eller, The mighty God, I he overla&s;ting Father, The Prince of Peace.</HI> Now the&s;e Characters of his Per&s;on and Office, are the mo&s;t magnificent that any Language can de|&s;cribe; and &s;erve to create in every pious Mind, a mo&s;t lively and a&s;toni&s;hing <HI>Idea</HI> of the incom|parable Glory of our exalted Redeemer: For they can't be a&s;cribed to any mere Creature without Bla&s;phemy and Non&s;en&s;e <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Pool.</NOTE>. And therefore mu&s;t belong only to the eternal Son of God, who is one in Nature and E&s;&s;ence with God the Father, and God the Holy Gho&s;t. Again,</P>
<P N="2">2. He was to have a Dominion every way an|&s;werable to the Dignity of his Per&s;on. This was foretold in the Words of my Text, and in the following Ver&s;e. <HI>And the Government &s;hall be upon his Shoulder.&mdash;Of the Increa&s;e of his Govern|ment and Peace there &s;hall be no End, upon the Throne of David, and upon his Kingdom, to order it, and to e&s;tabli&s;h it with Judgment and Ju&s;tice, from hence|forth even for ever.</HI></P>
<P>Here by <HI>Government</HI> we may under&s;tand the Admini&s;tration of all Affairs in the Kingdom of Providence and Grace.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="004321_0007_100454F5E7CCB880">And when the Prophet foretells that this Go|vernment &s;hould <HI>be upon the Shoulder Chri&s;t</HI>; the Meaning is, That our <HI>Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> by Vir|tue of his mediatorial Undertaking, would have a Right to this Government, and have the Ad|mini&s;tration of it committed to him by the Fa|ther.</P>
<P>And whereas the World <HI>Shoulder</HI> is u&s;ed to ex|pre&s;s this; 'tis a plain Allu&s;ion to a common Cu&s;tom among Mankind to lay heavy Burdens upon the Shoulder: and as plainly intimates, in this Place, That as all Governments if they are rightly managed, &s;o this e&s;pecially is a very great Burden, requiring extraordinary Care, and Di|ligence, and Fidelity, in the Admini&s;tration of it.</P>
<P>And having taken this general View of the Words: I come now more particularly to con&s;i|der this important Truth that is evidently con|tain'd in them. Namely,</P>
<P><HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> has the Government of all Things committed unto Him by the <HI>Father.</HI></P>
<P>In di&s;cour&s;ing upon this weighty Subject, I &s;hall go into the following Method.</P>
<P N="1">I. I &s;hall &s;ay &s;omething concerning the Per&s;on who is the Subject of this Government.</P>
<P N="2">II. I &s;hall con&s;ider the Nature and Properties of this Government.</P>
<P N="3">III. I &s;hall &s;how how Chri&s;t came to have the Admini&s;tration of it put into his Hands.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="5" REF="004321_0008_1004550693AD6638">IV. Say what the great End of it is.</P>
<P>And</P>
<P N="5">V. Apply the Matter, as near as I can, &s;o as to An&s;wer the De&s;ign of the pre&s;ent Solem|nity.</P>
<P N="1">I In the fir&s;t Place, I &s;hall take a brief View of <HI>the Per&s;on,</HI> who is &s;aid to have this Govern|ment upon him.</P>
<P>And in a Word, The Per&s;on who is the more immediate Subject of this Rule and Government, is the Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> as he is GOD and MAN united in one Per&s;on. For it is not the <HI>Son of God,</HI> con&s;idered <HI>as God alone</HI>; nor the <HI>Son of Man, &s;imply con&s;idered,</HI> that has this Dignity and Domi|nion given to him: For in the former Sen&s;e, the Son of God being <HI>equal with the Father,</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Phil 2.6.</NOTE> in all divine Perfections, needs no delegated Power from him; but has <HI>a natural Right</HI> to exerci&s;e a univer&s;al and ab&s;olute Sovereignty over all crea|ted Beings. And in the latter Sen&s;e; that is, if we con&s;ider Chri&s;t only as Man, he would be very unequal to the Charge committed to him; for it is va&s;tly too great, as we &s;hall pre&s;ently &s;ee, for any created Being as &s;uch. And from hence it nece&s;&s;arily follows, That it is, and mu&s;t be, the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, con&s;idered <HI>as</HI> GOD-MAN <HI>in one Per&s;on,</HI> who has the Goverment laid upon him. And therefore he is &s;poken of, in our Context, as partaking both of the human and di|vine Natures. His <HI>human Nature</HI> is plainly poin|ted out in the&s;e Words, <HI>Unto us a Child is born</HI>; for he could become a Child and be born, in no
<PB N="6" REF="004321_0009_100455116BA3B508">
other way, but as he was made Man. And when the Prophet adds, <HI>Unto us a Son is given,</HI> this, compared with the following Character of his Per&s;on, does as plainly intimate. That he is the <HI>eternal Son of God,</HI> as well as the Son of Man. And agreeably this &s;ame Prophet does, in ano|ther Place of his Prophecies, de&s;cribe him to us, under the Title and Character of <HI>Immanuel.</HI> I&s;a. 7.14. <HI>Behold a Virgin &s;hall conceive, and bear a Son, and &s;hall call his Name Immanuel: which, being interpreted, is, God with us</HI>; for this is the Ex|po&s;ition which the Holy Gho&s;t him&s;elf gives of the Word in <HI>Matth.</HI> 1.23. And having &s;aid this concerning the Per&s;on who admini&s;ters the Go|vernment &s;poken of in the Text,</P>
<P N="2">II. I come now to enquire more particularly into the Nature of this Government.</P>
<P>And in general, By this Government of Chri&s;t we may under&s;tand his Admini&s;tration of all Affairs in Heaven and Earth, &s;o as to advance the Glory of God, in the eternal Salvation of all God's Elect, and in the everla&s;ting De&s;truction all his and his Peoples implacable Enemies. <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>U&s;her</HI> and <HI>Ma&s;trecht.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Now this Government may be con&s;idered, ei|ther in general, as it is extended to all the Crea|tures, for the good of his Church and People in the World; and in this re&s;pect it is the &s;ame with the Kingdom of Providence. Or, it may be con&s;idered in particular, as it has a more im|mediate Relation to the Church, of which he is con&s;tituted Head in the new Covenant; and in
<PB N="7" REF="004321_0010_1004127721C4DDF0">
this regard, the Kingdom of Chri&s;t is u&s;ually called the Kingdom of Grace.</P>
<P>But as the time will not allow me to con&s;ider the Government of Chri&s;t in this doubleRe&s;pect; &s;o it will &s;ufficiently an&s;wer my pre&s;ent De&s;ign, to &s;peak of it in the fir&s;t Sen&s;e only: or, to give you &s;ome &s;hort Account of the Government of Chri&s;t in the Kingdom of Providence.</P>
<P>And accordingly I &s;hall here &s;ay &s;omething, Fir&s;t, concering the Acts of Chri&s;t s Govern|ment. And, Secondly, concerning the Proper|ties of it.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I &s;hall con&s;ider the <HI>Acts</HI> of Chri&s;t's Go|vernment; or &s;how wherein, or in what Re|&s;pects, he exerci&s;eth that Power and Authority committed to him by the Father.</P>
<P>But as it would be endle&s;s almo&s;t, to reckon up all the particular Acts of Chri&s;t's regal Au|thority; I &s;hall mention only, His upholding and pre&s;erving all Things in Being: His over|ruling and directing all Things, to the great End they were made for; and his judging the World of Angels and Men at the la&s;t Day. For the&s;e three more general and comprehen&s;ive Acts in|clude all the Particular ones under them.</P>
<P>To proceed then,</P>
<P N="1">1. Je&s;us Chri&s;t, by Virtue of his &s;overeign Power, upholds and pre&s;erves all Things in Be|ing: Hence he is &s;aid, in Heb. 1.3. <HI>To uphold all Things in Being by the Word of his Power.</HI> And a|gain the Apo&s;tle ob&s;erves, in Col. 2.17. <HI>He is before all Things, and by him all Things con&s;i&s;t.</HI> And
<PB N="8" REF="004321_0011_1004553118113D58">
therefore from the&s;e, and the like Pa&s;&s;ages, it plainly appears, That the Weight of the Crea|tion is laid upon Chri&s;t; and that he &s;upports the Whole, and all the Parts of it. For, as a pious Expo&s;itor <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Henry.</HI></NOTE> well ob&s;erves, <Q>When, upon the Apo&s;tacy of Man, the whole World was breaking to Pieces under the Wrath and Cur&s;e of God, the SON OF GOD, undertaking the Work of our Redemption, has bound it up a|gain, and e&s;tabli&s;hed it by his almighty Power and Goodne&s;s.</Q> He therefore pre&s;erves the World from disbanding and running into Confu|&s;ion: He keeps up the Frame and maintains the Order of it: He has all the Care upon him of whole Family in Heaven and Earth; and provides all things nece&s;&s;ary for their con&s;tant Support. And this he will continue to do, till he has brought in the whole Number of God's <HI>elect and redeemed Ones,</HI> and compleated <HI>his own my&s;ti|cal Body</HI>: For 'tis principally for the Sake of the&s;e, that the World, as it now is, continues in Being.</P>
<P>Again,</P>
<P N="2">2. As Je&s;us Chri&s;t upholds, &s;o he actually over|rules and directs all Things, &s;o as to an&s;wer the great End of their Being: that is, &s;o as to advance the Glory of God in the winding up of all.</P>
<P>And here I might fitly con&s;ider the Influence he has over the <HI>natural World,</HI> or that which we u&s;ually call the ordinary Cour&s;e of Nature. For, as this is part of God s providential Kingdom, &s;o it nece&s;&s;arily falls under his general Care and Direction: And he makes u&s;e of all Things in it,
<PB N="9" REF="004321_0012_1004127F8F3B3738">
&s;ome way or other, to &s;ub&s;erve the main Ends of his Government.</P>
<P>But as it is of greater Concernment to us to con&s;ider the Dominion of Chri&s;t over <HI>the moral Word</HI>; over Angels and Men, both good and bad; I &s;hall confine my Di&s;cour&s;e under this Head, to this Part of Chri&s;t's Government: and &s;ay,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) All the Angels, both good and bad, are in Subjection to Chri&s;t; and he rules and go|verns them all according to his Royal Will and Plea&s;ure. And agreeably, the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI> &s;peak|ing of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &s;ays in I Epi&s;t 2.22. <HI>He is gone into Heaven, and is on the right Hand of God, Angels, and Authorities, and Powers, being made &s;ubject to him.</HI></P>
<P>And therefore as for the Holy Angels, who kept their fir&s;t E&s;tate; Chri&s;t being an Head of Con|firmation to them, they are the Courtiers of Heaven that &s;urround his Throne of Glory; the Mini&s;ters of State that con&s;tantly and chearfully attend &amp; execute his Orders. And for this Rea&s;on, they are called <HI>mini&s;tring Spirits,</HI>in Heb.1.14. And he &s;ends them forth, not only <HI>to mini&s;ter for them who &s;hall be Heirs of Salvation,</HI> but he makes great U&s;e of them in the Admini&s;tration of the Kingdom of Providence. For we frequently read in Scrip|ture, of their immediate Agency in many of the great Events of Time; and particularly in &s;ome of the mo&s;t remarkable Di&s;pen&s;ations of his Ju|&s;tice and Grace to the World of Mankind.</P>
<P>And as the Angels of Light, &s;o the Powers of Darkne&s;s, or the evil Angels, are ab&s;olutely un|der the Dominion of Chri&s;t. They are indeed
<PB N="10" REF="004321_0013_10045552F50AA8B8">
the mo&s;t powerful and implacable Enemies he has to deal with. But however, as our great Re|deemer is the Angel &s;poken of in Rev. 20.I. <HI>Who has the key of the bottomle&s;Pit, and a great Chain in this Hand,</HI> He either permits or re&s;trains them at his Plea&s;ure. And when, at anytime, he gives them leave to exert their Power, and vent their
Rage and Malice, he over-rules them and their Actions, &s;o as to accompli&s;h the great Ends of his own Government, contrary to their own In|clination and Endeavour; as when he made them to confe&s;s him to be <HI>the Son of God</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke 4.41</NOTE>, and to be <HI>the Means of his Death</HI> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">John 13.17.</NOTE>, whereby the Kingdom and Works of the Devil were to be de&s;troyed: For upon this great Event we read, in Col. 2.15. <HI>Of his &s;poiling Principalities and Powers, and making a &s;hew of them openly, triumphing over them in hisCro&s;s.</HI> And having &s;aid this concerning the Dominion of Chri&s;t over the Angels both good and bad. I come to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="2">(2) Je&s;us Chri&s;t exerci&s;eth the &s;ame &s;overeign Power and Authority over the whole World of Mankind; and rules and governs them, and all their Affairs, both publick and private, accor|ding to his Will. For we read in the 28th Ver&s;e of the 22d P&s;alm, which is a plain Prophe&s;y concerning Chri&s;t. That <HI>the Kingdom is the LORD's, and he is Governour among the Nations.</HI></P>
<P>And in Con&s;equence of this, He Forms the States &amp;Empires of the World, &amp; enlargeth, or di|mini&s;heth, or da&s;heththem to Pieces again, as he &s;ees fit. This Power he claims to him&s;elf in the 18th Chapter of the Prophecies of <HI>Jeremiah</HI>; and
<PB N="11" REF="004321_0014_100455612F7B1B08">
&s;ay particularly in the 6th Ver&s;e, <HI>Behold, as the Clay is in the Potters Hand, &s;o are ye in my Hand, O Hou&s;e of</HI> I&s;rael. And as he Forms the Kingdoms of the Earth, by his &s;overeign Power; &s;o he gives the Dominion over them to whom he plea|&s;eth: He pulls down one and &s;ets up another, without giving any Account of his Conduct. And agreeably we read, in Dan. 2.21. <HI>He chan|geth the Times and the Sea&s;ons: he removeth Kings and &s;etteth up Kings: he giveth Wi&s;dom unto the Wi&s;e, and Knowledge to them that know Under&s;tanding.</HI></P>
<P>And in this Part of his Admini&s;tration, he o|ver-ruleth the grand Affairs of Empires &amp; States, &s;o as be&s;t to &s;ub&s;erve the great End of his media|torial Kingdom. A very remarkable In&s;tance of this we have, in his Enlarging the Borders of the Roman Empire, and e&s;tabli&s;hing Peace in all the Parts of it, about the time when <HI>he gave out the evangelical Law from Zion,</HI> and &s;ent forth his Amba&s;&s;adors to publi&s;h the glad Tidings of Sal|vation in all Parts of the Earth: For by this means, the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> of our Lord, had the greate&s;t Advantage to Travel from one Place to another, <HI>to preach the everla&s;ting Go&s;pel to every Creature</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. 28, 19, 20. Mark 16.15.</NOTE>, agreeable to the Commi&s;&s;ion they had receiv'd for this Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>And as the more publick, &s;o the more private Affairs of Mankind, are under the Government and Direction of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. For he is perfectly acquainted with every individual Per&s;on in the World; and knows all that be|longs to him, Yea, <HI>he &s;earcheth the very Hearts of
<PB N="12" REF="004321_0015_100455706108F090">
the Children of Men, and turns them which Way &s;o|ever he plea&s;eth, even as the Rivers of Water are tur|ned</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Rev. 2.23. Prov. 21.1.</NOTE>. And hence it is he makes the Godly to <HI>be his willing People in the Day of his Power,</HI> P&s;al. 110.3 And directs the Coun&s;els and Actions of the wicked, even contrary to their own In|tentions, &s;o as to accompli&s;h his own mo&s;t glo|rious De&s;igns: as we may &s;ee in the In&s;tance of the King of <HI>A&s;&s;yria,</HI> &s;poken of in the 10th Chapter of <HI>I&s;aiah.</HI> For his private De&s;ign was plainly <HI>to de|&s;troy and to cut off Nations not a few,</HI>Ver&s;e 7: but our &s;overeign Lord over-ruled him and his Manage|ments, &s;o as only to <HI>correct</HI> and <HI>reform</HI> a degene|rate People; as we find in the following Con|text. And thus I have con&s;idered the Dominion of Chri&s;t, as it is exerci&s;ed over all Things; and more e&s;pecially over Angels and Men, both good and bad. And now there remains but one thing more to be &s;poken to under this Head. And this is,</P>
<P N="3">3. Je&s;us Chri&s;t will finally Judge the World, and reward every rea&s;onable Creature according to his Deeds. This is a&s;&s;erted and confirmed to us from the Mouth of our Saviour him&s;elf, in John 5.22, 23. <HI>The Father judgeth no Man,</HI> i. e. he judgeth no Man immediately in his own Per&s;on; <HI>but hath committed all Judgment to the Son</HI>: and for this weighty Rea&s;on, <HI>That all Men &s;hould honour the Son, even as the Father.</HI> And of this we have a further Te&s;timony in Acts 17.31. where we are told, <HI>That the Father hath appointed a Day, in the which he judge the World in Righteou&s;ne&s;s, by that Man whom he hath ordained: where of he hath given A&s;&s;u|rance

unto all Men, in that he hath rai&s;ed him from the dead.</HI> And therefore, at the appointed Day&amp;Hour, which is known only in the &s;ecret Councils of Heaven, Je&s;us Chri&s;t will de&s;cend from Heaven, in all the Pomp &amp; Glory that becomes this high Office, and the great Occa&s;ion; and as we are a&s;&s;ured, in Rom. 2.6, &amp; onwards,<HI>He will render to every Man ac|cording to his Deeds: To them who by patient Continuance in well doing, &s;eek for Glory, and Honour, and Immor|tality; eternal Life: But to them that are Contentious, and do not obey the Truth, but obey Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s; Indignation and Wrath, Tribulation and Angui&s;h, upon every Soul of Man that doeth Evil; of the Jew fir&s;t, and al&s;o of the Gentile.</HI></P>
<P>And with this Act of judging the World, Chri&s;t will conclude his Admini&s;trations in the media|torial Kingdom, properly &s;o called. For pre|&s;ently upon this, we read of <HI>his delivering up the Kingdom to God, even the Father.</HI> As in 1 Cor.15.24.</P>
<P>And thus I have con&s;idered the more general and comprehen&s;ive Acts of Chri&s;t's regal Autho|rity. And now,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The next Thing in order, is, to &s;ay &s;omething concerning the <HI>Properties</HI> of Chri&s;t's Kingdom and Government. And here I have Time only to name the Particulars that de&s;erve a more large and di&s;tinct Con&s;ideration. As for In&s;tance,</P>
<P>This Government of Chri&s;t is <HI>univer&s;al,</HI> and knows no Bounds within the Compa&s;s of God's Creation. This is evident from what has been &s;aid already. And therefore the Kingdom of Chri&s;t is &s;aid <HI>to rule over all,</HI> in P&s;al. 103.19. And he him&s;elf is called, <HI>LORD of all,</HI> in Acts 10.36.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="004321_0017_10045590C62E5238">Again, This Government of Chri&s;t is admini|&s;tred with <HI>irre&s;i&s;table Power</HI>; or in &s;uch a Man|ner, as effectually to bring to pa&s;s the Coun|&s;els, of Heaven that are concerned in it. For as all Power in Heaven and Earth is given to him, we may fitly apply tho&s;e Words to him, in Dan. 4.35. <HI>He does according to his Will in the Army of Heaven, and among the Inhabitants of the Earth: and none can &s;tay his Hand, or &s;ay to him, What doe&s;t thou</HI>?</P>
<P>Put however, This Government is conducted by <HI>the mo&s;t con&s;ummate Wi&s;dom.</HI> For as infinite Wi&s;dom laid the De&s;ign, and form'd the Model of it; &s;o our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in his Admini|&s;tration, makes u&s;e of tho&s;e Laws, Means and In&s;truments, which are every Way fitted, in the be&s;t Manner, to an&s;wer the glorious Intentions of his Kingdom And with an Eye to this (I doubt not) he is called, <HI>the only wi&s;e God our Sa|viour,</HI> in <HI>Jude,</HI> Ver&s;e 25th.</P>
<P>Moreover, This Government of Chri&s;t is ad|mini&s;tred according to the &s;tricte&s;t Rules of <HI>Ju|&s;tice</HI> and <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Hence it is &s;aid in the 7th Ver&s;e of the Context, <HI>to be ordered and e&s;tabli&s;hed with Judgement and with Ju&s;tice.</HI> And this is confirmed in P&s;al. 89.4. where <HI>Ju&s;tice and Judg|ment</HI> are &s;aid to be <HI>the Habitation,</HI> or the very <HI>Ba&s;is, of Chri&s;t's Throne.</HI> And, in P&s;al. 45.6. <HI>The Sceptre of his Kingdom is a right Sceptre.</HI></P>
<P>And to this I &s;hall add, The Admini&s;trations of Chri&s;t's Kingdom are tempered with <HI>infinite Goodne&s;s, Grace</HI> and <HI>Mercy.</HI> For tho', as I &s;aid but now, Ju&s;tice and Judgment are the Habitation of his Throne; yet, his Throne is al&s;o called, <HI>a
<PB N="15" REF="004321_0018_1004559D4EA6F618">
Throne of Grace,</HI> in Heb. 4.16. And accordingly, He is mo&s;t mild and gracious in the pre&s;ent Ex|erci&s;e of his Government: in extending Patience and Long-&s;uffering towards his Enemies: in do|ing Good to all; yea, even to the unkind and unthankful: in declaring his Readine&s;s to be reconciled to Sinners upon their Submi&s;&s;ion to him: and in opening all the Trea&s;ures of Grace and Goodne&s;s to his willing and obedient People. And upon the&s;e accounts, he is call'd <HI>Prince of Peace,</HI> in our Context.</P>
<P>And now, finally, This Kingdom of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t is <HI>an everla&s;ting Kingdom.</HI> For &s;o it is &s;aid to be, in the Ver&s;e following the Text. <HI>Of the Increa&s;e of his Government and Peace there &s;hall be no End, upon the Throne of</HI> David, <HI>and upon his Kingdom, to order it, and to e&s;tabli&s;h it with Judg|ment and with Ju&s;tice, from henceforth even for ever.</HI> And agreeable to this are tho&s;e Words in P&s;al. 45.6 <HI>Thy Throne, O God, is for ever and ever.</HI> In|deed, the Time is ha&s;tning, when an End will be put to the pre&s;ent Method of Chri&s;t's Admini|&s;tration in his Kingdom. For when the whole Number of God's elect Ones &s;hall be effectually called and compleatly &s;aved; which is the &s;pe|cial De&s;ign of the pre&s;ent Admini&s;tration; Chri&s;t will then (as I ob&s;erv'd before) <HI>deliver up the King|dom to God, even the Father</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. 15.24.</NOTE>, i. e. He will re&s;ign the more immediate Government into the Hands of the GOD HEAD: But however, the happy Effects of this Government will &s;till abide; and the Glory both of the REDEEMER and RE|DEEMED continue for ever and ever.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="004321_0019_100455AB3608DAF0">And thus I have given you &s;ome account of the Nature of Chri&s;t's Kingdom, in the Acts and Properties of it: which was the &s;econd general Head I propo&s;ed to con&s;ider. And now,</P>
<P N="3">III. The next Thing in order, is to &s;how, <HI>how</HI> Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>God-Man,</HI> came to be <HI>ve&s;ted</HI> with this &s;overeign Power and Dominion over all Things:</P>
<P>And, in a Word: It was by the &s;pecial <HI>Will</HI> and <HI>Appointment</HI> of the <HI>Father.</HI> For Chri&s;t did not take to him&s;elf this great Power without Leave from the Father; nor without his imme|diate De&s;ignation to the Office. For it was a|greed between <HI>God</HI> the <HI>Father,</HI> and <HI>God</HI> the <HI>Son,</HI> in the Covenant of Redemption, That in Ca&s;e the <HI>Son</HI> would undertake the Work of Man's Re|demption, the <HI>Father</HI> would make him <HI>his Fir&s;t|born, higher than the Kings of the Earth.</HI> See P&s;al. 89.27. And accordingly the Government, in the Text, is &s;aid to <HI>be laid upon this Shoulder,</HI> and not a&s;&s;umed by him. And again, the Father, &s;peaking of this Exaltation of Chri&s;t, &s;ays in P&s;al. 2.6. <HI>I have &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t,</HI> i. e. I have appointed, rai&s;ed up, and crowned, <HI>my King, upon my holy Hill of Zion.</HI></P>
<P>And there appears to have been the&s;e two Rea&s;on more e&s;pecially, why this glorious Dig|nity was conferred by the Father upon his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="1">1. The fir&s;t was, <HI>to Reward his great Humilia|tion, Suffering and Death,</HI> in the mediatorial Un|dertaking. For this Undertaking was a free and voluntary Act in the Son of God. It was what he was under no Obligations to enter upon, any
<PB N="17" REF="004321_0020_100453556B1DC3F8">
farther than his own Will inclined and di&s;po&s;ed him. And therefore &s;ince he was plea&s;ed, in conformity to his Father's Will, and in Conjunc|tion with it, to undertake an Affair that requi|red greate&s;t <HI>Aba&s;ement</HI> in him&s;elf, and would, in the i&s;&s;ue, bring <HI>the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible Honour</HI> to God; God the <HI>Father</HI> decreed and promi&s;ed this Do|minion to his <HI>Son</HI>: and in Con&s;equence of the&s;e, has conferr'd the highe&s;t Honour upon him, as the Reward of his Undertaking. Of this the Apo&s;tle gives us a large and di&s;tinct Account, in Phil. 2.5, and onwards, <HI>Let this &s;ame Mind be in you, which was in Chri&s;t Je&s;us: who being in the Form of God, thought it no Robbery to be Equal with God: But made him&s;elf of no Reputation, and took upon him the Form of a Servant, and was made in the Likene&s;s of Men: And being found Fa&s;hion as a Man, he humbled him&s;elf, and became obedien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Death, even the Death of the Cro&s;s. Wherefore God al&s;o hath highly exalted him, and given him a Name, which is above every Name: That at the Name of Je&s;us, every Knee &s;hould bow, of Things in Heaven, and Things in earth, and Things under the Earth: And that every Tongue &s;hould confe&s;s, that Chri&s;t is Lord, to the Glory of God the Father.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Another &s;pecial Rea&s;n why this Dignity was conferred upon Je&s;us Chri&s;t, was, That he might be qualified to accompli&s;h the great Bu&s;i|ne&s;s of his mediatorial Undertaking. For the Work of Man's Redemption was of that Nature and Importance, and the Difficulties attending it &s;o great, that it appears ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that he, who &s;hould undertake the Work, &s;hould be ve&s;ted with a &s;overeign Power and Dominion over all Things; a Power to overcome all Op|po&s;ition, and to over-rule all Events, &s;o as to
<PB N="18" REF="004321_0021_100455B6CA845648">
effect the great End propo&s;ed. And, for this Rea&s;on, we are told, in Col. 1.19. <HI>It hath plea&s;ed the Father, that in him &s;hould all Fulne&s;s dwell,</HI> i. e. a fulne&s;s of Power and Authority, as well as a fulne&s;s of Grace and Merit. And by this means, Chri&s;t is &s;aid to be <HI>mighty to &s;ave,</HI> in I&s;a. 63.1. <HI>And able to &s;ave to the uttermo&s;t, all that come to God by him,</HI> as in Heb. 7.25. And this leads us to the next general Head in the Method propo&s;ed. And this is,</P>
<P N="4">IV. To give a &s;hort Account of the great End of Chri&s;t's Government and Kingdom.</P>
<P>For, as ever well con&s;tituted Government has &s;ome noble End in View; a publick Good, that is con&s;tanly aim'd at, in all the faithful Ad|mini&s;trations of it: &s;o the Kingdom of Chri&s;t, be|ing the Re&s;ult of infinite Wi&s;dom, the <HI>highe&s;t</HI> and <HI>la&s;t End of all,</HI> mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be propo&s;ed in it. And this can be nothing le&s;s than <HI>the Manife&s;ta|tion of the Glory of God.</HI> For this is the declared End of all the Works of God, in Creation. Providence and Redemption. And in particular, it evident|ly appears to be the great End our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour had in View, in the whole of his mediatorial Undertaking. To be &s;ure, it is what he had a principal Regard to in coming into the World: and therefore we have that <HI>Anthem</HI> of Prai&s;e, &s;ung by a Multitude of the heavenly Ho&s;t, at his Incarnation and Birth, Luke 2.14. <HI>Glory to God in the Highe&s;t, and on Earth Peace, good-will towards Men.</HI> Again, it is what his Eye was chiefly fixt on, in all that he did and &s;uffered on Earth: and therefore, upon his leaving the World, he made that mo&s;t comfortable Appeal to his Father, John 17.4. <HI>I have glorified thee on Earth: I have fini&s;hed the Work which thou gave&s;t me to do.</HI> And con&s;e|quently,
<PB N="19" REF="004321_0022_1004143891650C78">
when he had entirely pa&s;t through his State of Humiliation and Suffering; and, in a State of Exaltation, had all Power in Heaven and Earth committed to him, he nece&s;&s;arily kept the &s;ame great End in View.</P>
<P>And accordingly we have a mo&s;t glorious di&s;|play of the divine Perfections in the Reign of our Redeemer: They all &s;hine with an infinite Brightne&s;s, in the Admini&s;trations of his Govern|ment.</P>
<P>But as I have not Time to illu&s;trate this in all the Particulars, I &s;hall, on this Occa&s;ion, only name the infinite <HI>Mercy</HI> and <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> of God, which appear with a di&s;tingui&s;hing Glory in the Reign of our a Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. For when, on the one Hand we con&s;ider Chri&s;t <HI>as Head over all Things to the Church,</HI> as in Eph. 1.22. we have the mo&s;t ravi&s;hing Di&s;coveries of the infinite Grace and Mercy of God, and of all other divine Perfections, that are more nearly related to them; not only in Chri&s;t's gathering a People to him&s;elf out of the World, but in his continual Care to defend them again&s;t all the Power and Rage of Earth and Hell, which are in Combination again&s;t them; to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in all their Duties; to &s;up|ply all their Wants; to &s;upport them under all their Weakne&s;&s;es; to comfort them under all their Sorrows; to carry on and perfect his own Work in them; and to conduct them, at length, &s;afe into the immediate Pre&s;ence and Enjoyment of God; where <HI>Grace, Grace,</HI> will be the Subject of everla&s;ting Songs of Prai&s;e: So, on the other Hand, when we con&s;ider Chri&s;t as <HI>Lord of all,</HI> and exerting his Power over his Enemies; Here we have the mo&s;t awful Manife&s;tations of
<PB N="20" REF="004321_0023_100455C1B167FEB8">
infinite Holine&s;s, Ju&s;tice and Righteou&s;ne&s;s; in the Judgments which he frequently executeth on Earth again&s;t Sin and Sinners; in the Re&s;traint he continually lays upon his implacable Enemies; in the Frowns of his Indignation which they are perpetually under; and in pouring out all the Vials of divine Wrath upon them in the World to come. And upon the&s;e Accounts, the Apo&s;tle gives us to under&s;tand, in the forecited Phil. 2.11. That, fir&s;t or la&s;t, <HI>Every Tongue &s;hall confe&s;s, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is Lord, to the Glory of God the Fa|ther.</HI></P>
<P>And this brings me now,</P>
<P N="5">V. In the fifth and la&s;t Place, To <HI>apply</HI> the pre|ceeding Di&s;cour&s;e, to the Honour of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and our own In&s;truction.</P>
<P>And here,</P>
<P N="1">1. From what we have heard we may rea&s;o|nably infer the <HI>eternal Power and God-head</HI> of our ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer. For, though the Government under Con&s;ideration, was committed to him, as we have &s;aid, by a particular Di&s;pen&s;ation from the Father; yet, &s;uch is the Nature and Impor|tance of it, that it requires nothing le&s;s than in|finite Perfections to conduct it aright. That is to &s;ay, There needs the &s;ame infinite Power, which at fir&s;t created all Things, to uphold and pre&s;erve the World in its Being and Order: There needs infinite Knowledge to under&s;tand the particular Nature and Circum&s;tances of eve|ry individual Being, as it falls under his Care: There needs infinite Wi&s;dom to guide every Thing to its proper End: There needs infinite Patience to bear the many and repeated Affronts that are daily offered to the Sovereign of the
<PB N="21" REF="004321_0024_100412ACF342AA58">
World: and there needs infinite Justice and Righteou&s;ne&s;s; and, in a Word, every divine Perfection, to judge the World with an exact and righteous Judgment. And therefore, &s;ince the World is thus upheld and govern'd, and will be thus judged by Chri&s;t, at the la&s;t Day; the Con|&s;equence from hence is plain and nece&s;&s;ary, That he is the infinite God in our Nature:</P>
<P>And agreeably, we have the&s;e Characters of his Per&s;on and Office, given to him in our Con|text; &s;uch as THE MIGHTY GOD, THE EVERLASTING FATHER, THE PRINCE OF PEACE; that, as I ob&s;erv'd before, can't be a&s;cribed to any mere Creature, without Bla&s;phe|my and Non&s;en&s;e. And be&s;ides, on the account of his univer&s;al Dominion, the in&s;pired Apo&s;tle made no Difficulty to call him, <HI>God ble&s;&s;ed for ever,</HI> in Rom. 9.5. And, upon further Search, we find, that &s;everal of the incommunicable At|tributes of the divine Natures, are, in Scripture expre&s;sly a&s;cribed to our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Such as <HI>proper Eternity, Immen&s;ity Omnipotence, Omni&s;cience,</HI> and the like; as I could ea&s;ily &s;how, were this a fit Sea&s;on to enlarge upon the Sub|ject.</P>
<P>And therefore, by the Way, we may with Pro|priety enough take Notice of the gro&s;s Contra|diction and Idolatry, which tho&s;e Men, in the way of their Rea&s;oning and Practice, run them|&s;elves into, who deny the <HI>Divinity</HI> of Chri&s;t in the highe&s;t Sen&s;e of the Word; and yet, at the &s;ame time, own that all divine Perfections belong to him, be&s;ides <HI>Self-Exi&s;tence, ab&s;olute Supremacy and Independency</HI> (which they would have to be the only incommunicable Characters of the one &s;u|pream
<PB N="22" REF="004321_0025_1004143B9C658418">
Cod;) And al&s;o allow, that divine Ho|nours are due to Chri&s;t, on the account of his Dignity and Dominion.</P>
<P>For when they deny his Godhead in an ab&s;o|lute. Sen&s;e, they, at be&s;t, make him but a dignified Creature. And this, in the Nature of Things, is to make him but a finite Being; for to &s;uppo&s;e an infinite Creature, is an infinite Ab&s;urdity.</P>
<P>And again, When they confe&s;s that all divine Perfections be&s;ides tho&s;e above mentioned, belong to our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and con&s;equently, that <HI>Eternity, Omnipotence, Omnipre&s;ence, Omni&s;cience,</HI> and the like, are truly a&s;cribed to him; this is, in effect to make him the mo&s;t High God. For this God frequently challenges the&s;e Perfections as belonging to him&s;elf alone: and be&s;ides, the&s;e Perfections do al&s;o, in the Nature of Things, nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;e the Subject of them to be &s;trictly and properly infinite; unle&s;s we &s;uppo&s;e, than which, I think, nothing can be more ab|&s;urd, That there is greater and le&s;s, in proper Eternity, Immen&s;ity, Omnipotence, and the like. And therefore when we con&s;ider, on the one Hand, what they &s;ay to derogate from the true and proper GodHead of Chri&s;t; and, on the o|ther Hand, what they are forced, from Scripture|light, to a&s;cribe to him, they make Chri&s;t, in one and the &s;ame Sen&s;e, to be both finite and in|finite; which is a flat Contradiction.</P>
<P>And be&s;ides, if Chri&s;t is not the &s;upream God, he cannot be the proper Object of divine Wor|&s;hip: for God him&s;elf challenges &s;uch Wor&s;hip, as his Property alone, Matth. 4.10. And there|fore, when they are oblig'd to acknowledge &s;uch
<PB N="23" REF="004321_0026_1004143476633BA8">
Wor&s;hip is due to Chri&s;t, and pretend to pay &s;uch Homage to him; they give the Glory which is due to God alone, to <HI>another,</HI> contrary to his expre&s;s Will in the Ca&s;e, I&s;a. 42.8. And this is downright <HI>Idolatry.</HI> Nor does it at all excu&s;e or le&s;&s;en the Crime, to di&s;tingui&s;h divine Wor&s;hip, as they frequently do, into Supream and Subordinate; &s;ince there is no Foundation for &s;uch a Di&s;tinction to be met with in the &s;a|cred Scriptures. And therefore to conclude this Head, Let us devoutly <HI>acknowledge the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to be the only true God, and our God, and &s;o wor|&s;hip and glorify him accordingly.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. We &s;hould hence learn to eye and adore the Sovereignty of Chri&s;t, in all the Di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence and Grace that we meet with. For as he has the Superintendency of all Things in Heaven and Earth; and does particularly o|ver-rule and direct the grand Affairs of King|doms and Provinces here below, according to his Will and Plea&s;ure; we are certainly bound to eye the Hand of his Providence in all the Times and Sea&s;ons that pa&s;s over us. And if we religiou&s;ly attend this Duty, we &s;hall &s;oon find, that we owe as much to the &s;pecial Providence and Grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as any one People under Heaven.</P>
<P>For when we con&s;ider the many and great Things he has done for <HI>us</HI>; &s;ome of which we have &s;een with our Eyes, and many more which our Fathers have told us of; and, particularly, how he at fir&s;t bro't our Predece&s;&s;ors into this Wilderne&s;s, and bear them hither as upon Eagles Wings; how he &s;upported them under the many Dangers and Hard&s;hips of a Wilderne&s;s State;
<PB N="24" REF="004321_0027_100455F445F81B50">
how he drove out the Heathen before them, and gave them a &s;ure Footing in the Land; and at length turn'd an howling Wilderne&s;s into a fruit|ful Field, as we &s;ee at this Day. And when we further con&s;ider the many invaluable Privileges, both civil and religious, where with we have all along been favoured and di&s;tingui&s;hed among the <HI>Briti&s;h Colonies</HI>: precious Privileges, &s;ecured to us under the Sanction of <HI>a Royal Charter,</HI> and peaceably enjoy'd under the Protection of our lawful and rightful King <HI>GEORGE</HI> II. who, a|mong innumerable In&s;tances of his paternal Care for the Welfare of his Subjects in general, has, by a di&s;tingui&s;hing Act of Grace, fill'd up the &s;everal Po&s;ts of Honour and Government, re&s;erved to him&s;elf by the Royal Charter, from among the Sons of our People; who are therefore, under the &s;tronge&s;t Ties in Nature, of Intere&s;t and Af|fection, to &s;eek our Peace and Pro&s;perity: I &s;ay, when we con&s;ider the&s;e things in general, we &s;hall &s;carce find any People in the World, that owe more than we do, to the governing Provi|dence and Grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Put, upon this Occa&s;ion, I can't forbear to be more particular in one Article, wherein the Ho|nour of our dear Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t is mo&s;t nearly concerned, and whereby our Obligations to him are heightned to that Degree, that, I verily be|lieve, no one People in the World were ever under greater, to make the be&s;t Returns of Prai&s;e and Obedience to him. And this is with re&s;pect to our <HI>religious Privileges,</HI> which I hinted at be|fore.</P>
<P>For, as Chri&s;t, in taking the Government of the World upon him, had a peculiar Eye to his King|dom
<PB N="25" REF="004321_0028_100414450CB835D8">
of Grace which he was to &s;et up in it; &s;o his grand De&s;ign in forming and e&s;tabli&s;hing this People at fir&s;t, appears evidently to have been, That he might &s;et up his Go&s;pel Kingdom in the&s;e Parts of the World, in the Purity and Power of it; and therein receive the mo&s;t explicit and practical Acknowledgments of Him&s;elf in his kingly Rule and Government.</P>
<P>And accordingly he fir&s;t in&s;pired our Fore-Fa|thers with the pure&s;t Sentiments, concerning the Nature of the Go&s;pel Kingdom, and of His Sove|reignty alone in it; and enabled them to bear a faithful Te&s;timony to this glorious Truth in their native Land.</P>
<P>And when, in the Cour&s;e of his Providence, he ordered the Matter &s;o as to tran&s;plant and e|&s;tabli&s;h them here; he immediately <HI>took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e Ends of the Earth for him&s;elf.</HI> He &s;et up Go&s;pel Churches in the Land: Churches Pure in their Doctrine, Wor&s;hip and Di&s;cipline; and in the Con&s;titution of them, the free&s;t, I am per|&s;waded, of any in the World, from tho&s;e Mix|tures of human Invention, which have been &s;o great a Stain upon mo&s;t of the Churches of the Reformation.</P>
<P>And as he thus planted, &s;o he illuminated the&s;e Churches at fir&s;t, <HI>with Pa&s;tors after his own Heart.</HI> And having early put it into the Hearts of our Fathers, to erect <HI>a School for the Prophets</HI>; he has from thence granted a rich Supply of &s;uch Pa&s;tors from Time to Time, be&s;ides a con&s;idera|ble Number that have been our chief Glory and Defence in the civil Admini&s;tration.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="004321_0029_1004144B14DCBA90">And agreeably we have all along had many &s;ig|nal Tokens of Chri&s;t's promi&s;ed Pre&s;ence with us.

as the Subjects of Chri&s;t; and, as far as he has made him&s;elf known to them, they are expre&s;sly bound to honour him in all their Ad|mini&s;trations.</P>
<P>For, as <HI>Chri&s;t is Lord of all,</HI> he keeps the Reins of Government in his own Hands; and di&s;po&s;eth of States and Rulers according to his own &s;ove|reign Will and Plea&s;ure. And therefore he has given to none of the Princes of the Earth; no, not to the greate&s;t of them, a Power to act their own Will, in an arbitrary and de&s;potic Manner; or to make their own Will their only Rule, in the Exerci&s;e of that Power committed to them: But, in all their Admini&s;trations, he requires they &s;hould have a &s;trict Regard to &s;uch Laws, as he has made known to them, either by Providence or Grace.</P>
<P>And if &s;uch as we u&s;ually call &s;overeign Prin|ces on Earth, owe this Subjection to Chri&s;t, as ab&s;olute Lord of Heaven and Earth; all &s;ubor|dinate Rulers and Judges in a State, are, doubt|le&s;s, under as great Obligations to yield an en|tire Subjection to the Laws of Chri&s;t, in their Admini&s;trations of Ju&s;tice and Judgment among the People: Nor will the Pretence of Obedience to the Laws or In&s;tructions of the higher Powers excu&s;e them, or any el&s;e, in breaking in upon the known Rights of Mankind, or tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing any of the Laws of Nature or Revelation, when there happens to be an Incon&s;i&s;tency, between them, as &s;ometimes there has been, thro' the Weakne&s;s or Wickedne&s;s of Men in Power: But, in this Ca&s;e, the known Rule, by which the Apo&s;tles of our Lord govern'd and ju&s;tified them&s;elves, is to take Place, Acts 5.29. <HI>We ought to obey God rather than Men.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="004321_0031_100414506A26E8A8">It is therefore the Duty and Intere&s;t of all in Authority among Men, whether &s;upream or &s;ub|ordinate, to eye the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t as &s;ove|reign Lord of all; to &s;et his Laws before them, as the general Rule of their Admini&s;trations; and, as near as they can, to imitate him in all tho&s;e moral Perfections, which &s;hine &s;o gloriou&s;ly in the Admini&s;trations of his Government.</P>

<P>The Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as Sovereign of the World, has placed you, under our gracious King <HI>GEORGE</HI> on the Throne of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> at the Head of Affairs in this Province: you therefore owe the highe&s;t Honour and Allegiance to Him.</P>
<P>And to expre&s;s this Loyalty to <HI>the King of Kings,</HI> you mu&s;t not only make that per&s;onal Dedication of your &s;elves to Him &amp; his Service, which equally concerns all Mankind; but you mu&s;t, with the greate&s;t Diligence and Fidelity, apply your &s;elves to the &s;pecial Duties of your re&s;pective Stations, in the Service of your King and Country.</P>
<P>And here, &s;ince our ble&s;&s;ed Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t has &s;et up <HI>his Kingdom of Grace</HI> among this Peo|ple, as I ob&s;erved before; and has given you, not only the Laws of Nature, but the Light of divine Revelation, to guide you in all your Ad|mini&s;trations; you ought &s;urely, as chri&s;tian

<P>And to this Purpo&s;e, you mu&s;t employ your &s;uperiour Power and Talents &s;o as to make the civil Admini&s;tration, in the mo&s;t effectual Man|ner, to &s;ub&s;erve the great End of the Redeemer's Kingdom.</P>
<P>And this may be done; not by making and executing Laws, with a De&s;ign to oblige the Con&s;ciences of Men in Matters of divine Faith and Wor&s;hip; for this is a Royalty of Chri&s;t, a Flower in his Crown, which he has re&s;erved on|ly to him&s;elf: But it may be done, by employ|ing the Sword of Ju&s;tice, for the Re&s;traint and Puni&s;hment of open Profanene&s;s, Immorality, Ir|religion, and the like; by di&s;tingui&s;hing the mo&s;t faithful Subjects of Chri&s;t, with the more pecu|liar Smiles of Government; and by &s;etting be|fore the People a bright Example of every chri&s;|tian Grace and Virtue.</P>
<P>And here I might with Propriety eno', have gone into a particular Con&s;ideration of the State of this People; and have &s;hown both the reign|ing Di&s;tempers of the Land, and the Methods our honourable Rulers, in their &s;everal Stations, are to go into, in applying the proper Reme|dies for the Cure of them: But I find my &s;elf pre|vented, by &s;everal late excellent Di&s;cour&s;es of this Nature, upon this Occa&s;ion; and have, in a great Mea&s;ure, prevented my &s;elf, in one or two Di&s;cour&s;es publi&s;hed heretofore, by the Direction of the honourable Hou&s;e of <HI>Repre&s;entatives.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="004321_0033_1004119A5CC3E828">I &s;hall therefore, in this Place, only earne&s;tly intreat all that are immediately concerned in the <HI>Elections</HI> of this Day, That in the Choice of his <HI>Maje&s;ty's Council</HI> for the Province, which is a &s;in|gular Priviledge we enjoy, you would have a &s;trict Regard to the Honour of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and not chu&s;e Men to &s;erve a particular Turn; but Men <HI>that are under&s;tanding in the Times, to know what</HI> I&s;rael <HI>ought to do</HI>; and Men en|dow'd with divine Wi&s;dom from <HI>Chri&s;t, the won|derful Coun&s;eller</HI>: For the&s;e are the only Men that can act from the pure&s;t Principles, in the Service of God, their King, and their Country.</P>
<P>And when you come to act in General A&s;&s;em|bly, I humbly Reque&s;t, on the behalf of our com|mon Lord and Ma&s;ter, That you would act from the &s;ame divine Principle.

<P>And here, &s;uffer me, with due Defference, to expre&s;s my prevailing Fears, that there is &s;ome|thing of this Nature greatly wanting on your Part, to prevent the cruel Oppre&s;&s;ion and Inju|&s;tice that has, for a long time, been reigning a|mong us, on the account of the uncertain and fluctuating State of our <HI>Medium of Trade</HI>: for <HI>Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s between Man and Man,</HI> is certainly an e&s;|&s;ential Branch of the Religion of our ble&s;&s;ed Sa|viour.</P>
<P>And if any thing farther may be done by our honourable <HI>Legi&s;lators,</HI> to re&s;train that Flood of Iniquity which threatens our Ruin; this is what our &s;upream Lord expects and requires from you.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="004321_0034_1004561E814DC168">But, upon the be&s;t enquiry I have been able to make, I find, to your Honour, that we have <HI>a mo&s;t excellent Body of Laws,</HI> for the Suppre&s;&s;ion of Vice and Immorality; and that the great Thing wanting on this Head, is <HI>the due Execution</HI> of the whole&s;ome Laws in being. Not that I &s;uppo&s;e this is the only thing wanting to effect a thorow Reformation in the Land; for there is evidently, in this re&s;pect, too great a Backwardne&s;s in all Orders and Degrees among us; and even among tho&s;e who are called to mini&s;ter in holy Things, and <HI>are Watchmen and Reprovers by Office.</HI></P>
<P>But as my Bu&s;ine&s;s here is with the civil Ma|gi&s;trate; may I prevail with the worthy Gentle|men <HI>in Commi&s;&s;ion for the Peace,</HI> to exert them&s;elves, and be zealous in the Cau&s;e of Virtue and good Order; in &s;earching out and puni&s;hing the Workers of Iniquity, as the Laws of the Land, and the Oath of God you are under, oblige you; for herein you will eminently &s;erve Chri&s;t the Lord.</P>

Wherefore now, let the Fear of the LORD be upon you, take heed and do it: for there is no Iniquity with the LORD our God, nor re&s;pect of Per&s;ons, nor taking of Bribes.</HI> And when you may find a Nece&s;&s;ity to

<P>And now, to urge the Advice given to our ho|nourable Rulers in their &s;everal Degrees, I &s;hall take Leave ju&s;t to mention &s;ome few of the many Arguments and Motives, which, with due Con&s;i|deration, mu&s;t have the greate&s;t Influence upon you. As for In&s;tance,</P>
<P>All the Power you are ve&s;ted with, you recei|ved originally from Chri&s;t, as he is <HI>&s;upream Gover|nour among the Nations.</HI> And therefore God him|&s;elf, &s;peaking of civil Rulers, &s;ays, in P&s;al. 82.6. <HI>I have &s;aid, Ye are Gods,</HI> i. e. I have appointed and con&s;tituted you Rulers over the People. And agreeably the Apo&s;tle tells us, in Rom. 13.1. <HI>The Powers that be are ordained of God.</HI> And for this Rea&s;on, the civil Magi&s;trate is called, the <HI>mini|&s;ter of God,</HI> in the 4th Ver&s;e. Again,</P>
<P>In your Advancement in the World, the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t has imparted of his own Honour un|to you. And therefore ye are called <HI>Gods,</HI> by his &s;pecial Appointment, in the forecited P&s;al. 82.6. And agreeably he demands from his Peo|ple a proportionable Degree of Reverence and Obedience unto you. For that is his &s;overeign Will in this Ca&s;e, Rom. 13.2. <HI>Let every Soul be &s;ubject unto the higher Powers.</HI> And again, in Ver&s;e 7, <HI>Render therefore to all their Dues: Tribute to whom
<PB N="33" REF="004321_0036_1004562DAE7CF870">
Tribute is due; Cu&s;tom to whom Cu&s;tom, Fear to whom Fear, Honour to whom Honour.</HI> Furthermore,</P>
<P>As Chri&s;t is <HI>Lord of all,</HI> he keeps the &s;ame &s;trict Eye upon you, that he does upon the re&s;t of Mankind, and critically ob&s;erves and records all your Tempers, De&s;igns and Managements in your Admini&s;trations among the People. And to this Purpo&s;e we read, in P&s;al. 82.2. <HI>God &s;tan|deth in the Congregation of the Mighty; be judge&s;t among the Gods,</HI> And be&s;ides,</P>
<P>Tho', for the pre&s;ent, you are rai&s;ed in Ho|nour and Power above your Brethren, yet, <HI>your Breath is in your No&s;trils</HI>; and you mu&s;t, in a lit|tle Time, be levelled with the meane&s;t of the People, in the Du&s;t of Death. For &s;o &s;ay the Lord him&s;elf, the Author of your Advancement, in P&s;al. 82.6, 7. <HI>I have &s;aid, Ye are Gods: and all of you Children of the mo&s;t High. But ye &s;hall die like Men, and fall like one of the Princes.</HI> And here I can't but take Notice, with Grief and Sorrow, of the late convincing Proof of this, in the Death of that honourable Per&s;on <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Hon. <HI>Edmund Quincy,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q;</ABBR> who died of the Small|Pox in <HI>London,</HI> in an Agency for the Province, to the Court of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> on a very important Occa&s;ion.</NOTE>, who, for many Years pa&s;t, and in divers Stations, has been a great Honour and Ble&s;&s;ing to his Country, in the Wi&s;dom, Prudence, Piety and Steadine&s;s, that ever appeared in the Share he once had in the publick Admini&s;trations; and whom God has taken from us in the Height of his Service for the Country. This &s;ad In&s;tance, I doubt not, my honoured Fathers, has given you a lively
<PB N="34" REF="004321_0037_10041467C124DCA8">
View of your own Mortality. And as you mu&s;t thus die like other Men. <HI>your Glory will not de&s;cend into the Du&s;t after you.</HI> Nor will there any fur|ther Notice be taken of you on Earth, than on|ly either to grace your Memory with Prai&s;e, in ca&s;e you now approve your &s;elves Fathers and Benefactors to your Country; or, to load your Names with Infamy, if you &s;hould prove (which God forbid) to be the Oppre&s;&s;ors of the People. But this Con&s;ideration, tho' great in it &s;elf, is but of little Weight in compare with the follow|ing one. For,</P>
<P>In the la&s;t Place, As Chri&s;t will judge Angels and Men at the great Day, he will particularly call all the Rulers of the Earth to an Account for their Admini&s;trations in this World. And as their Talents and Betru&s;tments here are greater than others; &s;o (no doubt) will be the Terror or Comfort of their future great Account. And a|greeably, we read concerning &s;uch Kings and Rulers, <HI>who &s;et them&s;elves again&s;t the Lord, and a|gain&s;t his anointed</HI>; and prove them&s;elves the Plagues of Mankind, while they have any Power in their Hands; That Chri&s;t will at la&s;t <HI>break them with a Rod of Iron, and da&s;h them in Pieces like a Potters Ve&s;&s;el,</HI> &s;ee P&s;al. 2.2, 9. And therefore, not only the mean Men, but even the <HI>Mighty,</HI> who bid Defiance to Heaven, when they &s;hall &s;ee <HI>Chri&s;t, appear from Heaven, in flaming Fire, to take Vengeance on his Adver&s;aries; will hide them|&s;elves in the Dens, and in the Rocks of the Mountains. And &s;ay to the Mountain and Hills, Fall on us, and hide us from the Face of him that &s;itteth on the Throne, and from the Wrath of the Lamb: For the great Day of his Wrath is come; and who &s;hall be able to &s;tand?</HI> as in Rev. 6.15, 16, 17. While,
<PB N="35" REF="004321_0038_100414732B818320">
on the other Hand, tho&s;e Princes and Rulers a|mong Men, who, like <HI>David, &s;erve God and their Generation, according to the Will of God,</HI> &s;hall have di&s;tingui&s;hing Crowns of Glory &s;et on their Heads at the la&s;t Day, and be peculiarFavourites around the Throne of Chri&s;t for ever and ever. And from this Con&s;ideration of the final Judgment, we have that Exhortation to the Rulers of the Earth, with which I conclude this Head, P&s;al. 2.10.11.12. <HI>Be wi&s;e now therefore, O ye Kings: be in&s;tructed, ye Judges of the Earth. Serve the Lord with Fear, and rejoyce with Trembling. Ki&s;s the Son le&s;t he be angry, and ye peri&s;h from the Way, when his Wrath is kindled but a little: ble&s;&s;ed are all they that put their Tru&s;t in him.</HI> And this leads me to the la&s;t Head or Improvement; which is this,</P>
<P N="4">IV. Let us all now &s;ubmit to the Sceptre of Chri&s;t's Government, and be chiefly concerned for the Advancement of his Kingdom and Inte|re&s;t in the World. By the Kingdom of Chri&s;t here I intend his &s;piritual Kingdom, which is the great End of his providential Kingdom. And this is what we are under infinite Obligations to &s;eek the Advancement of; both on the Account of Chri&s;t's &s;etting up this Kingdom among us; and con&s;idering al&s;o, that the grand De&s;ign of our Fore-Fathers in coming hither, was to a&s;&s;ert and maintain His Supremacy alone in this King|dom. And now, that we may, in the mo&s;t effec|tual Manner, an&s;wer the ju&s;t Expectations of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord and Saviour concerning us; I &s;hall ju&s;t Hint at a few Things, and conclude the Di&s;|cour&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1. Let it be the fir&s;t and great Concern of e|very one, that this Kingdom of Chri&s;t may be
<PB N="36" REF="004321_0039_100455E3F8CD07E8">
&s;et up and flouri&s;h in his own Heart. And there|fore, where the Foundations of this Kingdom have not been laid already in any Heart; let the mi&s;erable Sinner, with a diligent U&s;e of all the other Means of Conver&s;ion, be earne&s;t in his Supplications, that the almighty Spirit of our Re|deemer, wou'd, in the Way of free and &s;overeign Grace, conquer the reigning Enmity within, and <HI>give him a new Heart, and a new Spirit.</HI> And where Chri&s;t has done this already; let the happy Soul rejoyce in God his Saviour, and, in the Exerci&s;e of a lively Faith, pray continually for the quick|ning, &s;anctifying and comforting Influences of the ever ble&s;&s;ed Spirit of Grace; for hereby we &s;hall readily bow to the Sceptre of Chri&s;t, and become his willing and obedient People, and know in happy Experience, what that Kingdom of God means, <HI>which con&s;i&s;ts in Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Peace and Joy in the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> Upon this,</P>
<P N="2">2. Let us Confe&s;s and bewail the great Oppo|&s;ition which the Kingdom of Chri&s;t meets with in the World, and more e&s;pecially among our &s;elves. For after all the &s;piritual Light and Pri|vileges, where with Chri&s;t has di&s;tingui&s;hed this Land and People, he has a multitude of open and &s;ecret Enemies among us. There are a great many here and there who lead &s;uch loo&s;e and debauch'd, &s;uch profane and irreligious Lives, that they proclaim to all the World, that they will not that Chri&s;t &s;hould reign over them. Again, Among tho&s;e who profe&s;s a Subjection to Chri&s;t, and have taken to them&s;elves a Form of Religion, have we not rea&s;on to fear, from the prevailing Deadne&s;s and Coldne&s;s of Profe&s;&s;or, and their Backwardne&s;s to every good Work: and from their Readine&s;s to drink in the
<PB N="37" REF="004321_0040_10041478532B2E48">
Poi&s;on of Error, and upon any light Temptation to for&s;ake the pure &s;criptural Wor&s;hip of the&s;e Churches; which, no doubt, is ob&s;erved &amp; re&s;en|ted by our Saviour as a very great Apo&s;tacy from him; and more e&s;pecially in any of the Children of <HI>NewEngland</HI>; I &s;ay, when we con&s;ider the&s;e Things, have we not rea&s;on to fear that a very great Pro|portion of vi&s;ible Profe&s;&s;ors, are utter Strangers to all vital Religion; and &s;o, whatever their outward Profe&s;&s;ion may be, they are Enemies in Heart to Chri&s;t and his Religion? And be&s;ides, when the very be&s;t of Men look into their own Hearts, they &s;oon find a great deal of Oppo&s;ition to the Work of Grace there, from the Workings of that inbred Enmity again&s;t God, and his holy Laws, which all Mankind bring into the World with them. And therefore in our concern for the Advancement of Chri&s;t's &s;piritual Kingdom, the&s;e, and the like Things, are greatly to be la|mented by the People of God. Again,</P>
<P N="3">3. Let us earne&s;tly pray for the Enlargement and Pro&s;perity of Chri&s;t's Kingdom in the Power and Glory of it: <HI>That his Kingdom may come, and his Will be done in Earth, as it is in Heaven.</HI> And to this end, That the Lord would make bear his holy Arm in the Eyes of all the Nations, that all the Ends of the Earth may &s;ee the Salvation of our God: That where the Name of Chri&s;t is known, his Sceptre may be univer&s;ally, bowed down unto: and e&s;pecially our own Nation and Land</P>
<P>And &s;ince God has given us a Prote&s;tant King on the <HI>Briti&s;h Throne,</HI> with the hopeful Pro&s;pect of a long Succe&s;&s;ion of &s;uch Princes in the illu|&s;trious Hou&s;e of HANOVER; for which we owe the mo&s;t grateful Acknowledgements to Heaven;

Let us pray, That the Days of our King may be many, and his Reign pro&s;perous; <HI>That the Honour of Chri&s;t, by whom Kings Reign, and Princes decree Ju&s;tice,</HI> may be ever near his Heart. And e&s;pe|cially let us go on to pray, that the mo&s;t afflictive Di&s;pen&s;ation of Providence, in the Death of our late incomparable and gracious Queen CARO|LINE, (who&s;e Death has been as heartily and u|niver&s;ally lamented in this Province, as in any Part of his Maje&s;ty's Dominions) may be &s;ancti|fied to his Royal Per&s;on and Hou&s;e, and to the whole Nation: That his Maje&s;ty may be graci|ou&s;ly &s;upported under the irreparable Lo&s;s; and from this mo&s;t affecting In&s;tance of the Vanity of earthly Glory, in the Height of it, may be a|bundantly quickned and enlarged to a faithful Di&s;charge of that Duty, which the &s;overeign Lord of all expects from one in his exalted Sta|tion: That when he comes to lay down his earthly Crown in the Du&s;t, he may receive a mo&s;t dis&s;tingui&s;hing Crown of never-fading Glory in the World to come.</P>
<P>Again, Let us pray, that our more immediate Rulers may have abundant Mea&s;ures of the Spi|rit granted to them from on high, to fit them, in their &s;everal Stations, eminently to &s;erve the <HI>Lord Chri&s;t,</HI> in being <HI>a Prai&s;e to &s;uch as do well, and a Terror to evil doers.</HI></P>
<P>That our Mini&s;ters, in the Cour&s;e of their Mini&s;try, may de&s;ire <HI>to know nothing, &s;ave Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and him crucified,</HI> and be enabled to di&s;play the lovely Glories of our Redeemer, in their Doctrine and Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>That our Churches may hold fa&s;t the Things they have received; and by walking &s;tedfa&s;t in the <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Order</HI> of the Go&s;pel, may have re&s;t and be edified.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="004321_0042_1004149667318608">That the Means of Grace which we enjoy, may have tho&s;e divine Influences attending them, whereby &s;aving Conver&s;ions may be multiplied among us, and Converts fill'd with Righteou&s;|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>In a Word, Let us pray for the plentiful Effu|&s;ions of the ever-ble&s;&s;ed Spirit of Grace, that the <HI>Work of God may appear unto his Servants, and his Glory unto their Children; and that the Beauty of the Lord our God may be upon us.</HI> And now,</P>
<P N="4">4. Finally, Let us all, in our &s;everal Places and Relations, &s;tudy and endeavour, by divine A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, faithfully to di&s;charge the Duties required of us in the Go&s;pel of God our Saviour. And then may we hope to have the Smiles of his Pro|vidence upon us in all our Affairs, both publick and private; and in a little Time to &s;ee the Ful|fillment of that gracious Promi&s;e, which (I doubt not) has a Reference to the&s;e Go&s;pel Days, in I&s;a. 44.2, 3, 4, 5, 6. <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord that made thee, and formed thee from the Womb, which will help thee, Fear not,</HI> OJacob <HI>my Servant, and thou</HI> Je&s;urun, <HI>whom I have cho&s;en. For I will pour Water upon him that is thir&s;ty, and Floods upon the dry Ground: I will pour my Spirit upon thy Seed, and my Ble&s;&s;ing upon thine Off-&s;pring: And they &s;hall &s;pring up as among the Gra&s;s, as Willows by the Water-Cour&s;es. One &s;hall &s;ay, I am the LORD's: and another &s;hall call him&s;elf by the Name of</HI> Jacob: <HI>and another &s;hall &s;ub&s;cribe with his Hand unto the LORD, and Surname him&s;elf by the Name of</HI> I&s;rael. <HI>Thus &s;aith the LORD the King of</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>and his Redeemer the LORD of Ho&s;ts, I am the fir&s;t, and I am the la&s;t, and be&s;ides me there is no God.</HI></P>
