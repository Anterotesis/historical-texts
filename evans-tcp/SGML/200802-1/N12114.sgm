<P>TRUE, &s;he is but a beggar's daughter, yet her per&s;on is a miracle; and her amiable qualities &s;uch as might well befit a better &s;tation.

<P>Dear father, let me indulge the joy to call you &s;o, the happine&s;s you give me with your daughter, is half de&s;troyed by this unexpected fortune. The plea&s;ure I had promi&s;ed my&s;elf in labouring with my hands to maintain the father of my love, is now no more; but let me &s;till rejoice, that by this means.</P>

<L>My Be&s;&s;y's gentle heart is free'd from care,</L>

<L>Hence let this maxim to the world be given,</L>
<L>True love and virtue are the care of heaven.</L>

<L>And to this fair, this fini&s;h'd form, were join'd</L>
<L>The &s;ofte&s;t pa&s;&s;ions, and the pure&s;t mind.</L>
</LG>
<P>Among&s;t the neighbouring youths who &s;trove to gain FIDELIA'S heart, LYSANDER made his addre&s;|&s;es. He was a younger brother, of a good family, but &s;mall fortune. His per&s;on was hand&s;ome and genteel, his manners ea&s;y and engaging. With the&s;e advantages he &s;oon obtain'd a place in young FIDE|LIA's heart; and, as her fortune, which was very con&s;iderable, was in her own di&s;po&s;e, there was no ob&s;tacle to their happine&s;s; with all the eloquence of a lover, he pre&s;s'd the con&s;ummation of his wi&s;hes, a
<PB N="57" REF="015288_0052_0F98D1E7093481A0">
tender &s;oftne&s;s pleads within her brea&s;t, &s;he yields to the force of his per&s;wa&s;ions, and they are married.</P>
<P>Who can expre&s;s the plea&s;ures which they now en|joy? To make her happy &s;eem'd the &s;cope of all his actions, and &s;uch a growing fondne&s;s warm'd her heart, that every day endear'd him more and more. The fortune which &s;he brought, he managed with prudence and di&s;cretion; and the plea&s;ure which he found in her &s;weet behaviour, and inchanting beau|ties, repaid his cares with intere&s;t. Thus flew the hours, wing'd with delight; the day pa&s;s'd not with|out &s;ome new endearment; and the night felt name|le&s;s raptures, or &s;erene repo&s;e.</P>
<P>Before the end of two years their loves wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> crown'd with a &s;miling boy. If any thing could en|crea&s;e their fondne&s;s of each other, 'twas this engag|ing pledge of their affection. But, alas! how varia|ble is the heart of man! how ea&s;ily are his pa&s;&s;ions inflam'd! how &s;oon his be&s;t affections alter'd! and rea&s;on, which &s;hould be his guide, is but as the light of a candle, which the lea&s;t gu&s;t of pa&s;&s;ion can puff out, and quite extingui&s;h. Of this unhappy truth, LYSANDER &s;oon became a fatal in&s;tance.</P>
<P>It happen'd at this time, whether by accident of de&s;ign, I know not, that a creature of exqui&s;ite beau|ty, but of infamous character, came to lodge exactly over again&s;t the hou&s;e of this, till then, mo&s;t happy pair. As LYSANDER was not only po&s;&s;e&s;t of a hand|&s;ome per&s;on, but now al&s;o of an ample fortune, im|mediately a thou&s;and arts were try'd by this in|veigling harlot, to attract his ob&s;ervation, and if po&s;|&s;ible to en&s;nare his heart. At her window, in his &s;ight, &s;he would appear in a loo&s;e and tempting di&s;|habille. Now in a &s;eeming negligence di&s;cover white her naked brea&s;ts, then with a leering &s;mile pretend
<PB N="58" REF="015288_0053_0F98D1E7855C2970">
to hide them from his &s;ight. Her wanton eyes, all &s;parkling with delight, &s;he now would fix with eager|ne&s;s upon him; then in a &s;oft and langui&s;hing air by &s;low degrees withdraw, yet looking back as loath to leave the place.</P>
<P>As LYSANDER had too much experience of the world, not to under&s;tand this amorous language, &s;o his heart was too &s;u&s;ceptible of the tender pa&s;&s;ion, not to feel its force. And unable to with&s;tand the daily repetition of the&s;e provoking temptations, he at la&s;t determin'd to go over privately one evening and make her a vi&s;it. It will be needle&s;s to &s;ay he was kindly receiv'd, how kindly, will be better imagin'd than expre&s;s'd. Here had he &s;top'd, this one tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion might have been forgiven: But &s;uch was his infatu|ation, that from this time his vi&s;its became frequent: he was &s;o intoxicated with her charms (for indeed &s;he was hand&s;ome) and &s;o bewitch'd with her alluring blandi&s;hments, that the mode&s;t beauty of his fair and virtuous wife became at once neglected, and at length de&s;pis'd.</P>
<P>Poor FIDELIA! who can expre&s;s the agonies of her heart when fir&s;t the fatal &s;ecret &s;he di&s;cover'd? Con&s;cious on how many accounts &s;he merited his love, pride and re&s;entment for &s;ome time &s;truggled with her affection; but &s;uch was the &s;oftne&s;s of her nature, &s;uch the tenderne&s;s of her pa&s;&s;ion, that &s;he was not able to reproach him any other way than by a &s;ilent grief. Alone &s;he pin'd, and like a lily in the &s;ecret vale droop'd her fair head, unfriended and un|&s;een. Of what mu&s;t be his heart, that &s;uch endear|ing &s;oftne&s;s could not melt, that &s;uch ingaging virtue &s;ham'd not into goodne&s;s! But &s;uch is the nature of vice, that it hardens the heart to all humane and generous impre&s;&s;ions. At fir&s;t, perhaps, his virtue
<PB N="59" REF="015288_0054_0F98D1E844EA1E20">
made &s;ome efforts in her favour; but the trouble it co&s;t him to &s;uppre&s;s them when the rage of his new|kindled flame return'd, made him by degrees unwil|ling to indulge them. Thus endeavouring to &s;mother all remains of gratitude or compa&s;&s;ion, he became at length as in&s;en&s;ible to her grief as to her wrongs.</P>
<P>Barbarian! how can&s;t thou lavi&s;h on abandon'd vilene&s;s, that wealth, which love and un&s;u&s;pecting virtue tru&s;ted to thy hand! how can&s;t thou leave that angel &s;weetne&s;s, that untainted ro&s;e, for paint, pollut|ed charms, and pro&s;titution! how can&s;t thou &s;ee thy tender innocent babe &s;uck with its milk tho&s;e grief|di&s;tilling drops, that fall ince&s;&s;ant on her &s;nowy brea&s;t, for thy unkind neglect! Unfeeling wretch! But what is man not capable to do, when blind with pa&s;&s;ion, harden'd with his guilt? Alas! this is but the be|ginning of her woes; and nothing to the grief this haple&s;s fair one is ordain'd to &s;uffer. Indifference is &s;oon &s;ucceeded by ill nature and ill u&s;age. He now no longer makes a &s;ecret of his ba&s;e intrigue. Whole days and nights are &s;pent in her lewd chambers, &s;hamele&s;s and open in the &s;ight of the world, and in the very face of his in&s;ulted, injur'd, unoffending wife.</P>
<P>But this was not enough. Home, and the &s;ight of this affronted, yet &s;till patient virtue, became unea&s;y and di&s;gu&s;tful. He is therefore determin'd to remove her from him. But the means of bringing this about were as infamous, as the de&s;ire of doing it was cruel. His valet de chambre, who&s;e name was Craven, had liv'd with him &s;ome years, and was a man whom he found to be capable of any villany he &s;hould think fit to employ him in. This man he prevail'd with, by large gifts and many promi&s;es, to conceal him&s;elf in FIDELIA'S bed-chamber, and continue there, &s;aid he

But to the point. Mankind have a right to happine&s;s; liberty is e&s;&s;ential to happine&s;s; therefore every man has a right to li|berty. Now if every man has a right to liberty, and and the very offence of liberty con&s;i&s;ts (as before a&s;&s;ert|ed) in doing what one will, then every man has un|doubtedly a right &s;o to do. This rea&s;oning is &s;o d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ong and conclu&s;ive, that I am under no apprehen|&s;ion of its being thought that the privilege of the pulpit alone &s;ecures me from contradiction. The thing &s;peaks it&s;elf, and every action we do confirms the truth of it. How ready are we upon all occa&s;ions to cry out, I will do &s;o and &s;o, or I will not do &s;o
<PB N="78" REF="015288_0074_0F98D1F8C514CFD0">
and &s;o? Now if mankind had not a right to do what they will, the&s;e phra&s;es would be ab&s;urd and ridiculous. Be&s;ides, we have the authority of &s;cripture to &s;upport this our opinion. St. Paul, &s;peaking of a young man, &s;ays, <HI>let him do what he will he &s;inneth not.</HI> In the twelfth chapter of Deu|teronomy it is written, <HI>we do here this day every man what&s;oever is right in his own eyes.</HI> And in the twenty-fifth chapter of Leviticus, the Jews are com|manded to proclaim liberty (that is, a right of doing what they will) throughout all the land, and to all the inhabitants thereof.

And thus I think I have &s;ufficiently prov'd, both from rea&s;on and &s;cripture, that mankind have an undoubted right to do what they will.</P>
<P>2<HI>dly,</HI> I am to prove. That there is no plea&s;ure in the practice for any one virtue what&s;oever, and con|&s;equently that virtue can be no part of that religion who&s;e ways are ways of plea&s;antne&s;s.</P>

<P>It has been allow'd by the be&s;t divines, that the only end, or at lea&s;t the chief motive, which God could have for creating us, was our own happine&s;s: I &s;hall therefore take this for granted, without en|quiring any farther into the truth of it, and confine my&s;elf only to &s;eek by what means this great end is be&s;t to be acquir'd.</P>
<P>Some late writers have made a great &s;tir with vir|tue, the real, the intrin&s;ick plea&s;ures of virtue. But I am in hop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s that one &s;ingle ob&s;ervation will be &s;uf|ficient to e&s;tabli&s;h it in the minds of all this good congregation, that plea&s;ure and virtue are two diffe|rent things.

No, I believe it will ea&s;ily be granted me, that the &s;tronge&s;t bent of mankind is to what &s;ome call vices, but what I &s;hall call natural plea&s;ures, and which, if happine&s;s is the end of our creation, mu&s;t con&s;equently be al|lowed to be the readie&s;t means of accompli&s;hing that end.

<P>Let us hear next what Cha&s;tity can &s;ay for it&s;elf; that impudent virtue, which dares to contradict the very fir&s;t command of God almighty, <HI>encrea&s;e and multiply.</HI> This virtue relates only to our commerce with the other &s;ex; and would a man recommend him&s;elf to any woman by telling her that he was cha&s;te? I fancy not. It is a cold uncomfortable quality, and the man that is born with it will do wi&s;ely to conceal his infirmity from all the world. But it will be &s;aid, perhaps, this virtue belongs in a more peculiar manner to the female &s;ex. Let me a&s;k you, my beloved; would any of you like a wo|man the better for coldne&s;s and indifference? I tell ye no. If then this pretended virtue will neither re|commend a man to his mi&s;tre&s;s, nor a lady to her lover, of what u&s;e is it in the world? You will &s;ay, the honour of families is concerned in it; perhaps it may; let every man look to that as well as he can: but &s;ure the peace and harmony of families depend on &s;omething el&s;e. I could, my beloved, but at pre&s;ent I will not pu&s;h this virtue any further; but &s;hall leave it to your own pious endeavours, and doubt not but to the utmo&s;t of your abilities you will &s;trive to pu&s;h it out of the world.</P>
<P>Let us now hear what the &s;neaking virtue of tem|perance can pretend to. Nature has given us appe|tites,
<PB N="83" REF="015288_0078_0F98D1FBE156A718">
and the goodne&s;s of heaven has abundantly fur|ni&s;hed the world with agreeable gratifications; but this &s;tern, this rigid pretender would debar us the enjoyment of them; would impiou&s;ly contradict the good and gracious de&s;igns of heaven, and condemn us to fa&s;ting and mortification. But be not deceived with idle pretences; almighty wi&s;dom has created nought in vain: the good things of this world were made to be enjoyed, and all our appetites were given to be indulg'd therein. Let us eat then, my beloved, and drink without mea&s;ure; always remembering the words of the wi&s;e &s;on of Sirach, <HI>What life is there to a man that is without wine? for it was good to make men glad.</HI> Yea, let us trea&s;ure up in our hearts that golden &s;aying of Solomon, the wi&s;e&s;t man on earth, <HI>There is nothing better for a man than that he &s;hould eat and drink, and make his &s;oul enjoy made in his labour: for God giveth to a man that is good in his &s;ight, wi&s;dom and knowledge, and JOY.</HI> Thus you &s;ee, my bre|thren, that the wi&s;dom and knowledge which God giveth is accompanied with joy; and he that pre|tendeth to either without out, his knowledge is vain, his wi&s;dom is a mi&s;ery and a burden unto him.</P>
<P>I could go on with great facility to all the other virtues; I could &s;how the &s;tupidity of Patience, the poor-&s;piritedne&s;s of Humility, the weakne&s;s of Good|nature, the folly and danger of Courage, and the ab|&s;olute madne&s;s of Sincerity; but I doubt not that what I have &s;aid is &s;ufficient to confirm you all in the worthy principles which have hitherto influenced all your actions. I appeal to your hearts, my beloved, whether I have not &s;poken their own &s;entments, and whether what I have &s;aid is not &s;ecretly whi&s;per'd to every one of you from his own &s;oul.

therefore of your hearty acquie&s;cence in my &s;econd propo&s;ition, that there is no plea&s;ure in the practice of any one <HI>virtue</HI> what&s;over, and con&s;equently that <HI>virtue</HI> can be no part of that religion who&s;e ways are ways of plea&s;antne&s;s.</P>
<P>I proceed, then, in the third-and la&s;t place, to an|&s;wer &s;ome trifling objections, and &s;o conclude. And fir&s;t, it may perhaps be objected on the behalf of Charity, that it is humane and generous to feel and compa&s;&s;ionate the di&s;tre&s;&s;es and misfortunes of our fellow creatures. If a man is &s;o utterly lo&s;t to all &s;teadine&s;s and fortitude of &s;oul, as to be affected, or in the lea&s;t moved with any thing that does not con|cern him&s;elf; to that man I have nothing to &s;ay; his heart perhaps may be &s;o &s;trangely con&s;tituted, that for aught I know it may be a plea&s;ure to him to p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ty and relieve the mi&s;eries of others; but his ca&s;e is &s;o very uncommon, and &s;o directly contrary to the general practice of the world, that it is not worth while to take up your time in exp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ing his weakne&s;s&punc; e&s;pecially as I am <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ully per&s;uaded there are but &s;ew of you, if any, that envy him his plea&s;ure, or will imitate him in it.</P>
<P>In the next place, it may be objected wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">h regard <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o Ju&s;tice, that the man that is not ju&s;t and fair in all his dealings, very often runs the hazard of his life, and always of his character.

<P><PB N="85" REF="015288_0080_0F98D1FE4FC97D18">
Thirdly, it may perhaps be urg'd again&s;t the plea|&s;ures of Luxury and Concupi&s;cence, that they expo&s;e a man to many incoveniences, &s;uch as the lo&s;s of time, health, fortune, character, and &s;ome few more &s;uch trifles as the&s;e. I am afraid we mu&s;t al&s;o allow that there is &s;ome weight in this objection. But what then? the man that has not &s;pirit enough to &s;acrifice the&s;e trifling con&s;iderations to the &s;ublime plea&s;ures of eating, drinking, and whoring, is unde&s;erving of them. What are the pains of a fever or a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eit, or what the lo&s;s of health, &s;trength, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, in compari&s;on with the voluptuous plea&s;ures of a table, or the &s;prightly joys of midnight bowls? Is the lo&s;s of a no&s;e to be brought in competition wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">h the dear delights that occa&s;ion'd it? The wretch who can be &s;o ungrateful to think &s;o, is unworthy to wear the honourable &s;car.</P>
<P>In fine, it may perhaps be objected again&s;t all man|ner of Vices in general, that they are the con&s;tant parents of anxiety, care, repentance and mi&s;ery; and that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> on the contrary is forever attended with health, peace, and plea&s;ure. The contra&s;t is &s;trong, my beloved, it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd; but whe|ther it is ju&s;t or not, I am per&s;uaded none of you know. What then &s;hall I advi&s;e? or how &s;hall I direct you? Suppo&s;e for once you &s;hould try, and enter on a cour&s;e of Virtue: It cannot be more di&s;|agreeable than a cour&s;e of phy&s;ick, perhaps not &s;o much &s;o; and then, to u&s;e the doctor's phra&s;e, it is perfectly &s;afe, and cannot po&s;&s;ibly do you any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. At fir&s;t indeed, as you are quite &s;trangers to the re|li&s;h of it, it may &s;eem &s;omething nau&s;eous and unpa|latable; but if you once get over the difficulty of the fir&s;t trial, who knows, thro' cu&s;tom, how agreeable

<HEAD>THE Hu&s;band, Wife, and the Doctor. A MATRIMONIAL HISTORY. From the French of Mon&s;ieur De St. Evremont.</HEAD>
<P>AT the time that Mon&s;ieur de Comminges was amba&s;&s;ador from the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King to his M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">je&s;ty of Great Britain, there came to London a phy&s;ician, who called him&s;elf an Iri&s;hman: This per&s;on pa&s;&s;ed for a great philo&s;opher, and a mighty performer of wonders, according to the opinion of the credulous, and his own per&s;ua&s;ion; and the method he took to cure the di&s;temper'd, made him to be &s;u&s;|pected in many places <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">or a magician.</P>
<P>Some per&s;ons of quality having intreated Mon&s;ieur de Comminges to &s;end for him to his hou&s;e, in order to &s;ee &s;ome of his prodigies, he was very willing to grant them that &s;atisfaction, as well to gratify his natural curi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ity, as his complai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ance for them. So he &s;ent notice to this pretended magician, to come to his home.</P>
<P>Upon the noi&s;e, which this news made in all parts of the town, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of Mon&s;ieur de Comminges was &s;oon filled with &s;ick people, who came with a full a&s;&s;urance to be cured.</P>
<P>The Iri&s;hman made them wait for him &s;ome time; and after an impatient expectation, the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">k and curious &s;aw him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">rive with a grave, but &s;imple c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">tenance, which carried in it not the lea&s;t mark of an impo&s;tor.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="015288_0087_0F98D204620C00E0">
Mon&s;ieur de Comminges prepared him&s;elf to ex|amine him nicely, hoping he &s;hould be able to enlarge him&s;elf at plea&s;ure upon all that he had read in Van-Helmont and Bodin: but he could not effect it, to his great concern: for the crowd became &s;o trouble-&s;ome, and the infirm pre&s;&s;ed on &s;o eagerly to be cured fir&s;t, that they had much ado with menaces, and even force, to regulate their ranks.</P>
<P>This Iri&s;h phy&s;ician a&s;cribed all indi&s;po&s;itions to &s;pirits; and all infirmities, according to him, were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t man that was pre&s;ented to him, was one troubled with the gout and rheumati&s;ms, which he had in vain endeavour'd to get cured of. Which our wonder-maker ob&s;erving, "I have &s;een long ago, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> this &s;ort of &s;pirits in Ireland. They are water-&s;pirits which bring coldne&s;s, and excite &s;uper|fluities of humours in the&s;e poor bodies. Thou evil &s;pirit, who ha&s;t left the habitation of the waters, to come and afflict this mi&s;erable body, I command thee to abandon thy new abode, and to return to thy ancient habitation." Having &s;aid this, the &s;ick man retired; and another was brought in his room, who complain'd he was tormented with melancholy vapours.</P>
<P>Indeed he was one of tho&s;e whom we commonly call hypocondriacks, and &s;ick of imagination, although they are but too much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o in effect. "Airy &s;pirit, <HI>&s;ays the</HI> Iri&s;hman, Return into the air to exerci&s;e thy trade in rai&s;ing of tempe&s;ts, and &s;tir up no more hur|ricanes in this &s;ad and mi&s;erable body."</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="015288_0088_0F98D204D040D7C8">
This &s;ick per&s;on gave way to another who was di&s;turbed, according to the opinion of our phy&s;ician, with a puny hobgoblin, who would not have force enough to with&s;tand his di&s;cour&s;e a moment. He apprehended that he had found him out by certain marks, which did not appear to us; and &s;miling upon the a&s;&s;embly. "This &s;ort of &s;pirits, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> are &s;eldom trouble&s;ome, and almo&s;t always diverting."</P>
<P>In &s;hort, he knew every thing that related to &s;pirits. He was acquainted with their numbers, their ranks, their names, their employments and functions; nay, he boa&s;ted that he under&s;tood the intrigues of de|mons, much better than the affairs of men.</P>
<P>You cannot imagine what a reputation he gain'd in a very little time. Catholicks and prote&s;tants came to him from all parts; and you would have &s;aid that the power of heaven was lodged in the hands of this man, when an unexpected adventure, de&s;troyed the wonderful opinion which the puplic had entertain'd of him.</P>
<P>An Engli&s;h gentleman and his lady, who had been married for &s;ome time, came to &s;eek &s;ome relief in his miracle-working virtue again&s;t certain &s;pirits of di&s;cord, &s;aid they, which di&s;turbed their marriage, and ruined the peace of their family.</P>
<P>The gentleman was about 45 years old, and look'd like a per&s;on of e&s;tate and quality. Methinks I have the lady yet before my eyes. She was about thirty years old, and was per&s;onable enough; but one might ea&s;ily read in her face, that &s;he had been much more hand&s;ome formerly. I have named the hu&s;band fir&s;t,
<PB N="94" REF="015288_0089_0F98D2058F75C380">
for the dignity of his rank; yet the wife would &s;peak fir&s;t, whether it was becau&s;e &s;he believ'd her &s;elf to be mo&s;t tormented by her &s;pirit, or that &s;he was only excited with that ambition of talking, which is &s;o natural to her &s;ex.</P>
<P>"My hu&s;band, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> is one of the be&s;t men in the world, I give him a thou&s;and di&s;quiets, and he gives me no fewer in his turn. I would willingly live comfortably with him, and &s;hould not fail of my de&s;ires, if a &s;trange &s;pirit, with which I feel my&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed at certain times, did not make me &s;o peevi&s;h and ill&punc;humour'd, that there's no enduring me. After the&s;e agitations are over, I return to my natural good humour; I then omit nothing that may &s;erve to oblige my hu&s;band: But his demon po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es him, when mine for&s;akes me; and this hu&s;band of mine, who bears my tran&s;ports &s;o patiently, is a down-right fury to me, when I am my&s;elf. And alas! I endure no le&s;s from him, than he from me." Here &s;topt our lady, who in all appearance, &s;tated her ca&s;e truly; and the hu&s;band, who &s;eem'd to be no le&s;s &s;incere then his wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e, began his di&s;cour&s;e, as follows:</P>
<P>"Whatever rea&s;on I have to complain of my wife's devil, I am however obliged to him, that he has not taught her to lie; for I mu&s;t own that &s;he has &s;aid nothing but what is lit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ally true. All the time that &s;he appears to me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o be in the&s;e agitations, I am compo&s;ed; but as &s;oon as her &s;pirit leaves her in peace, mine torments me in its turn; and as it in&s;pires <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> with rew co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">age, and new forces, I make her then know the dependance of a wife, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of a hu&s;band. Thus our lives pa&s;s in perpetual wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ither <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, which makes our
<PB N="95" REF="015288_0090_0F98D20649E25988">
condition as mi&s;erable as can be imagin'd. Thus Doctor, I have acquainted you with our ca&s;e, and if you have a remedy for it, I de&s;ire you to be our de|liverer. The cure of a di&s;temper &s;o &s;trange as this of ours, will bring you no little honour."</P>
<P>"The&s;e are neither hobgoblins nor fairies, <HI>&s;aid the</HI> Iri&s;hman, they are &s;pirits of the fir&s;t order, and belong to Lucifer's legion: Proud demons, great enemies to obedience, and very hard to expel. You will not take it ami&s;s, gentlemen, pur&s;ued he, turning to the a&s;&s;embly, if I examine my books a little; for I have occa&s;ion for words that are out of the common road." Upon this he withdrew into a clo&s;e, in order to turn over his books and papers; and after he had tried a hundred forms, as too weak to combat &s;uch powerful enemies, he pitch'd at la&s;t upon one, that was able, as he pretended, to confound and expel all the devils in hell.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t effect of the conjuration was upon him|&s;elf; for his eyes began to rowl in his head, with &s;o many grimaces and convul&s;ions, that his patients might very well take him for a di&s;tracted man.</P>
<P>After he had &s;tared and looked about him, he fixed his eyes at length upon this virtuous couple, and &s;triking both of them with a wand, which cou'd not be without virtue: "Begone, ye &s;pirits of di&s;&s;en|tion, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> and exerci&s;e di&s;cord in hell, and by your departure let that happy union be re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, which you have &s;o impiou&s;ly broken. Then he ap|proached &s;oftly to the ears of the pretended po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and rai&s;ing the tone of his voice, I hear you murmur devils, at the obedience which ye are forced to pay
<PB N="96" REF="015288_0091_0F98D20713415DF8">
to me: But were ye to bur&s;t with madne&s;s ye mu&s;t be gone. Depart, depart, and you my friends, go and enjoy that repo&s;e, which ye have been deprived of &s;o long. 'Tis done, gentlemen, and I prote&s;t to you that I am all over in a &s;weat with the fatigue, which the oppo&s;ition of the&s;e ob&s;tinate devils has given me. I believe I have had to do with two thou&s;and &s;pirits in my time, who all together have not given me &s;o much pain and trouble as the&s;e." After this our Iri&s;hman retired, and all the company went out of the hou&s;e, and our good couple returned to their lodgings, with a &s;atisfaction more miraculous than the prodigy, which had been wrought in their favour.</P>
<P>When they came home, every thing appeared agreeable to them upon this new alteration of mind, which created a new di&s;po&s;ition in their &s;en&s;es: They found a &s;miling air in every thing; they lookt upon them&s;elves with plea&s;ure, and were not wanting in &s;weet and tender words to expre&s;s their love. But, vain delights, how little dependance is there upon your duration! And how un&s;ea&s;onably, do per&s;ons that are born to misfortunes rejoice, when they ob|tain one &s;hort moment of happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Such was their tranquillity, when a lady of their acquaintance came, to acquaint them with the general joy of the town for their cure.</P>
<P>They an&s;wered this civility in a very obliging manner, and the u&s;ual compliments on this occa&s;ion being made and returned, the hu&s;band began a very pertinent conver&s;ation upon the happy condition they were now in, after &s;o many mi&s;eries as they had
<PB N="97" REF="015288_0092_0F98D207C576A6B0">
endured. Our wife, either to cau&s;e a greater admira|tion of this miracle, or el&s;e to plea&s;e her own malici|ous humour, enlarged her&s;elf with &s;atisfaction upon the tricks which her devil had &s;ugge&s;ted to her, to torment her hu&s;band. Upon which, the hu&s;band jealous of the honour of his devil, or at lea&s;t, of his own authority, gave her to under&s;tand, That &s;he talked too feelingly of things pa&s;t, the remembrance whereof was trouble&s;ome to him. He added, That con&s;idering all was now well, &s;he ought to think of nothing el&s;e, but that obedience which a wife owes to her hu&s;band; as he would only con&s;ider on his &s;ide, how to make a lawful u&s;e of his privileges, in order to make their condition as happy for the future, as it had been unfortunate till now.</P>
<P>Our wife, who deeply re&s;ented the word obedience; but e&s;pecially the cruel injunction to hold her tongue, brought all the arguments &s;he cou'd think of, to prove an equality in marriage, &s;aying, That the devils were not at &s;uch a di&s;tance, but they might be re|called, in ca&s;e this equality was violated.</P>
<P>The lady above-mention'd, who was as di&s;creet and judicious as any of her &s;ex, wi&s;ely repre&s;ented to her the duty of wives, and at the &s;ame time preach|ed up the conduct and good management, that hu&s;bands are obliged to u&s;e. But her rea&s;ons, in&s;tead of compo&s;ing, did but more incen&s;e her, &s;o that &s;he became more in&s;upportable than before. You are in the right, dear wife, replied the hu&s;band, "The devils were not gone &s;o far, but they might ea&s;ily be recalled; or rather, you have been &s;o kind to yours, that he re&s;olves to continue with you, notwith&s;tanding the po&s;itive command that was laid upon him to
<PB N="98" REF="015288_0093_0F98D20885669180">
leave you. I am too weak of my&s;elf to be concerned alone with you and him; which obliges me to retire, expo&s;ed as I am to &s;uch an unequal combat. And I likewi&s;e retire, &s;ays &s;he, with this &s;pirit, that will not abandon me. He mu&s;t be a very ill humour'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ort of a devil indeed, if he is not more tractable than &s;o trouble&s;ome a hu&s;band. Then turning towards her friend: Before I go, &s;aid &s;he to her. I am glad I have an occa&s;ion, madam, to tell you freely, that I expect|ed quite another treatment from your friend&s;hip, and that you have forgot the intere&s;t which obliges you, to take a wife's part again&s;t the ill u&s;age of her hu&s;|band. 'Tis a very &s;trange thing that I &s;hould be run down by one that ought to have e&s;pou&s;ed my quarrel. Adieu, madam, adieu; your vi&s;its do me a great deal of honour, but one may very well be with|out them, if this is all the good they do."</P>
<P>Our good, but too di&s;creet lady was extremely &s;urpriz'd at this compliment; being now convinced by her own experience, that even wi&s;dom may over|&s;hoot it&s;elf, and that for the mo&s;t part we make an ill u&s;e of our rea&s;on with tho&s;e who have none.</P>
<P>You may imagine &s;he did not &s;tay long alone in a hou&s;e, where nothing was talked of but devils, and nothing done but what was extravagant to the highe&s;t degree.</P>
<P>The hu&s;band pa&s;&s;ed the re&s;t of the day and all the night in his chamber, a&s;hamed of the &s;hort-liv'd joy he had received, vexed at the pre&s;ent &s;tate of his affairs, and reflecting, with great anxiety of mind upon what he might expect from this &s;udden return of his wife's di&s;temper:</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="015288_0094_0F98D2094520D5F0">
As the agitation of the wife had been much more violent, &s;o it continued not &s;o long; and returning &s;oon to her&s;elf, &s;he made &s;ome reflections upon the lo&s;s of tho&s;e plea&s;ures, of which &s;he &s;aw her&s;elf depriv'd.</P>
<P>A certain re&s;tle&s;s &s;pirit that &s;hall be namele&s;s, &s;uffer'd few moments to pa&s;s without demanding a rea&s;on of the &s;pirit of di&s;cord, why it &s;hould &s;acrifice its intere&s;t and plea&s;ure to it thus to no purpo&s;e. This &s;pirit, which particularly influenceth tho&s;e of the fair &s;ex, but chiefly a-nights when they cannot &s;leep, had its de&s;ired effect upon our lady, &s;o that re&s;igning her&s;elf up purely to the conduct of nature, &s;he awaked her hu&s;band as &s;oon as was day, de&s;igning to a&s;cribe all pa&s;t di&s;orders to a &s;trange power, which is neither natural nor human. "I am &s;atisfied, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> in the lucid interval I enjoy at pre&s;ent, that our &s;pirits did not immediately leave us, when our Iri&s;h Doctor commanded them to be gone; but if you'll take my advice, my dear, but too unhappy hu&s;band, we will go again and a&s;k him for a &s;tronger and more effectual charm."</P>
<P>The poor hu&s;band, oppre&s;&s;ed with grief, as he was, and fainting under the &s;everity of his de&s;tiny, judge if he was not very glad to find &s;o unexpected a calm, and tenderly affected with this amorous return in his &s;pou&s;e: "Let us bemoan, my dear, <HI>&s;ays he</HI> to her, Let us bemoan our common misfortunes, and go a &s;econd time to &s;carch a remedy, which at fir&s;t we could not obtain."</P>
<P>The wife was agreeably &s;urprized at this di&s;cour&s;e; for in&s;tead of a trouble&s;ome demon who&s;e in&s;ults &s;he
<PB N="100" REF="015288_0095_0F98CEB30583F8D8">
expected, &s;he happily found a man tender and com|pa&s;&s;ionate, who gave her com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ort for that very unea&s;i|ne&s;s &s;he had given him; and of which he him&s;elf had bore the greate&s;t &s;hare.</P>
<P>They &s;pent an hour or two to po&s;&s;e&s;s one another with a mutual confidence, and placing all their hopes in the mighty &s;kill of the phy&s;ician, they returned to the hou&s;e of Mon&s;ieur de Comminges, in order to procure a more powerful relief, than that which they had tried before.</P>
<P>Scarce were they entered into the hou&s;e, but the Iri&s;hman perceived them, and calling them pretty loud, that he might be heard by all the company; "Come, <HI>&s;ays he to them,</HI> Publi&s;h the miracle which has been effected in you, and make your acknow|ledgments to that all pui&s;&s;ant power, which has delivered you from the wretched &s;lavery under which ye groaned."</P>
<P>The wife immediately replied of her own head, That as for the te&s;timony he demanded of them, they were ready to give him one of the ob&s;tinacy of the devils, but not of his &s;kill. "For in truth, ve|nerable father, <HI>added &s;he;</HI> &s;ince your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> operation they have tormented us, as it were out of &s;pite, more violently then ever."</P>
<P>"You are incredulous, <HI>cried out our good</HI> Iri&s;hman in a wonderful pa&s;&s;ion, or at lea&s;t ungrateful, who maliciou&s;ly deny tho&s;e benefits ye have received. Approach hither, approach; that I may convict you of incredulity, or malice.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="015288_0096_0F98CEB186AD7900">
When they came near him, he nicely examined all the lines of their faces. He particularly ob&s;erved their looks, and as if he had di&s;covered in the apple of their eyes &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion of the&s;e &s;pirits; "you are in the right, <HI>&s;ays he, all amaz'd;</HI> you are in the right they are not yet di&s;lodg'd. They are too deeply rooted in your bodies to &s;urrender at the fir&s;t &s;um|mons, but they mu&s;t hold fa&s;t indeed, if the words I am going now to pronounce, don't eject them.</P>
<P><Q>Leave, you accur&s;ed race, an habitation of re|po&s;e too good for you, and go and rave for ever in places, where dwell horror, madne&s;s, and de&s;pair.</Q></P>
<P>'Tis done, my friends, you are mo&s;t certainly de|livered: But return no more, I intreat ye. I owe my time to all the world, and you have had as much of it as comes to your &s;hare."</P>
<P>Now our patients &s;uppo&s;ed them&s;elves at the end of all their misfortunes: This day &s;eemed as happy to them as the fir&s;t of their marriage, and the night was expected with the &s;ame impatience, as that of their nuptials had been formerly. This night &s;o much de&s;ired came, but alas! How ill did it an&s;wer their expectations!</P>
<P>Too much love cau&s;es the &s;hame of lovers, and I leave the reader to imagine the great confu&s;ion of an adventure,
<Q><L><HI>Where exce&s;s of de&s;ire,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Does extingui&s;h the fire.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="015288_0097_0F98CEB24566CC18">
'Twas happy for the hu&s;band, that his wife accu&s;ed the devils that were innocent; for &s;he was now &s;atisfied that our famous phy&s;ician was a true Iri&s;h|man, who, for all his pretences, had not &s;kill enough to conjure down an <HI>Ignis Fatuus.</HI> Sometimes &s;he imputed to her&s;elf this non-performance of her hu&s;|band, after the example of the Spani&s;h women, who attribute to them&s;elves, in the&s;e occa&s;ions, the failings of their lovers; as being per&s;uaded that the force of their charms ought neither to &s;ubmit to the infir|mity of nature, nor to the power of witchcraft.</P>
<P>Thus our wife, who accu&s;ed her hu&s;band in every thing el&s;e, where he was mo&s;t innocent, ju&s;tifies him where he was mo&s;t deficient, in paying the conjugal tribute; and rather cho&s;e to impute a want of love in him, to a want of charms in her&s;elf, than to a real defect, which would prove eternally de&s;tructive of her plea&s;ures. But as a lady doth not willingly enter|tain a thought that hurts the intere&s;t of her beauty, &s;he immediately recalled in her mind the malice of the devils, and turn'd her confu&s;ion into anger again&s;t the Iri&s;hman, who had not &s;kill enough to eject them.</P>
<P>"We have, <HI>&s;ays &s;he, with anger &s;parkling in her eyes,</HI> we have been too long made fools of by this &s;orry Bogg-Trotter, but now I find that 'tis non&s;en&s;e to expect our deliverance from him. However it is not enough that we are undeceived; ju&s;tice obliges us to undeceive others as well as our&s;elves, and to make known to the world, the roguery of the&s;e quacks."</P>
<P>"My dear, <HI>reply'd the hu&s;band,</HI> 'Tis undoubtedly true, that the misfortune of this night is purely owing

to our devils. The Iri&s;hman thought to banter, but they re&s;olved to ridicule him and us in their turn. You know me, and I know my&s;elf; &s;uch a &s;trange impotence cou'd not naturally happen, I &s;ay it cou'd not naturally happen, and I dare &s;wear there was witchcraft in the ca&s;e. But my dear, <HI>continued he,</HI> when you take the impo&s;tor to ta&s;k, don't mention the particulars; and let nothing &s;lip, which may tend to our &s;hame. All family &s;ecrets ought to be concealed: But this in a more particular manner."</P>
<P>The wife had like to have relap&s;ed into one of her old fits to &s;ee her&s;elf &s;u&s;pected of &s;uch an indi&s;cretion: But not to embroil things anew, that were tending to a good accommodation, &s;he promis'd &s;o to manage her&s;elf, that none but the Iri&s;hman &s;hould find fault with her.</P>
<P>We u&s;ually &s;eek the night to conceal our &s;hame, but the day here appeared to di&s;per&s;e it; and the&s;e unhappy per&s;ons who were not yet well recovered of their misfortune, got up with the &s;un, who enlivens all things, in hopes their affairs wou'd change for the better.</P>
<P>They ro&s;e out of their bed with more tranquillity, than they had found there, and after a &s;mall breakfa&s;t, and a little conver&s;ation to fortify their bodies, and reconcile their minds, they went in peace and good union towards the hou&s;e, whither they had gone twice with confidence, and from whence they had twice returned without any relief. They received advice there, that the Iri&s;hman was gone to St. James's to perform &s;ome wonders there, at the in&s;tance of Mon&s;ieur d'Aubigny, &s;o well known to all the world,
<PB N="104" REF="015288_0099_0F98CEB4855F07D0">
for one of the mo&s;t agreeable men that ever was&punc; Behold then &s;ome of the prodigies which I remarked at St. James's, with le&s;s credulity than the multitude, and with le&s;s prejudice than Mon&s;ieur d'Aubigny.</P>
<P>Already did the blind &s;uppo&s;e they &s;aw that light they did not &s;ee; already did the deaf imagine they heard, and heard not; the lame already thought they were grown well; and the impotent rea&s;&s;umed in imagination the fir&s;t u&s;e of all their limbs. A &s;trong idea of health had made the &s;ick forget their di&s;|tempers; and imagination which was no le&s;s active in the curious, than in the &s;ick, gave the fir&s;t a fal&s;e pro&s;pect through their de&s;ire of &s;eeing, as it gave a fal&s;e cure to the &s;econd, through their de&s;ire of being cured.</P>
<P>Such was the power of the Iri&s;hman upon our minds: Such was the force of our minds upon our &s;en&s;es. Thus nothing was talked off but prodigies; and the&s;e prodigies came from &s;o great an authority, that the a&s;toni&s;hed multitude receiv'd them with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, whil&s;t &s;ome more knowing per&s;ons dur&s;t not reject them by their knowledge.</P>
<P>A timorous and &s;lavi&s;h knowledge always pays re&s;pect to an imperious and authoriz'd error: The &s;oul was weak when the under&s;tanding was &s;ound, and tho&s;e who &s;aw be&s;t into the&s;e imaginary cures, dur&s;t not &s;peak their real &s;entiments among a preju|diced and deluded herd of believers.</P>
<P>Such was the triumph of the Iri&s;hman, when our couple couragiou&s;ly broke through the crowd, to come and in&s;ult him in all his maje&s;ty. "Art not

Thou ha&s;t enjoin'd our devils to leave us in repo&s;e, and they have but torment<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed us the more for't. Thou ha&s;t commanded them to be gone, yet they &s;till per&s;ecute us, not with|&s;tanding thy orders, and equally deride our &s;otti&s;h credulity, and thy ineffectual impotence."</P>
<P>The hu&s;band continued the &s;ame reproaches with the &s;ame contempt &s;o far as to refu&s;e him the name of impo&s;tor, becau&s;e there was need of capacity, &s;aid he, for an impo&s;tor, and this mi&s;erable wretch wanted even that; which was only &s;upported by the &s;uper|&s;titious belief people had of him, that &s;pirits were at his command.</P>
<P>Our prophet lo&s;t his &s;peech with lo&s;ing the autho|rity which made him venerable; and this formidable power, came to nothing, &s;o &s;oon as there appeared per&s;ons bold enough to di&s;own it; thus &s;urpriz'd, non-plu&s;t and confounded, our Iri&s;hman withdrew, and went out at the back door.</P>
<P>His confu&s;ion extremely mortified the a&s;&s;embly, there being nothing that a man receives with &s;o much &s;atisfaction, as the opinion of a miracle, nor leaves with more difficulty and concern.</P>
<P>As for Mon&s;ieur d'Aubigny, he &s;oon reckon'd this prophet in the &s;ame cla&s;s with others, whom he had tried; being re&s;olv'd for the future to keep to tho&s;e of the country, without any inclination to make u&s;e of new comers, merely becau&s;e they were &s;trangers.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="015288_0101_0F98CEB6054968A8">
All the company retired, a&s;hamed of their ea&s;ine&s;s to be abus'd, and yet ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ed at the lo&s;s of their error. Our married couple, glorious and triumphant, enjoyed the plea&s;ures of victory, without any further thoughts of the devils; and Mon&s;ieur d'Aubigny, who ea&s;ily pa&s;&s;ed from one opinion to another, quitted his former belief of our miracle-monger, to give him&s;elf the plea&s;ure of laughing with me, at what had hap|pen'd.</P>
<P>At my breaking out into a &s;udden fit of laughter, the hu&s;band turned his head towards us, and perceiv|ing Mon&s;ieur d'Aubigny, he came civilly up to him to excu&s;e him&s;elf for what he had done in his hou&s;e, without a&s;king his permi&s;&s;ion. Mr. d'Aubigny an|&s;wered him very courteou&s;ly, and gave him thanks, not only for di&s;abu&s;ing the public, but al&s;o for unde|ceiving him&s;elf in particular.</P>
<P>The wife immediately took her part in the conver|&s;ation, which did not render it le&s;s agreeable; for although &s;he was really extravagant, yet it was a &s;ort of extravagance which proceeded rather from her humour than her mind: But now &s;he took care to conceal it; and we talk'd of nothing but mirth and plea&s;antry, when Mr. d'Aubigny entertain'd them with the grave&s;t di&s;cour&s;e in the world, which I little expected.</P>
<P>"I am, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> a per&s;on of an acknowledging temper, and &s;hould be ungrateful if I did not draw you out of your error, after I have been oblig'd to you for drawing me out of mine. As it was not enough for your own minds to torment you, and that there mu&s;t be &s;omething el&s;e be&s;ides a long marriage

The wi&s;e&s;t are weary of them&s;elves, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ter they have been weary of others: And would you have a hu&s;band and wife, who are always of different minds, and different humours, to live eternally together without di&s;gu&s;t, without vexation, and without di&s;putes? Believe me, &s;ir, of a hundred married couples, four&s;core and ten at lea&s;t are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, after your fa&s;hion, without any of the devil's a&s;&s;i&s;tance to make them &s;o. The only difference I find between them and you is, that they &s;uffer their misfortunes with patience, and conceal them with di&s;cretion, whereas you importune heaven and hell for yours, in laying your unhappine&s;s on demons that are innocent, and in &s;eeking a &s;uperna|tural a&s;&s;i&s;tance when there is no occa&s;ion for it."</P>
<P>What may pa&s;s for a real prodigy, was the &s;udden alteration in the hu&s;band and his wife, upon the di&s;|cour&s;e of Mr. d'Aubigny; they look'd upon them|&s;elves with a&s;toni&s;hment, a&s;ham'd of having been their own devils, when there was nothing of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on, but only contrariety of humours in the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>The hu&s;band was the fir&s;t who returned from his confu&s;ion to give a thou&s;and thanks to Mr. d'Aubigny, for having given them the true knowledge of their misfortune. "But, <HI>Replied the wife,</HI> doth this know|ledge make us er'e the le&s;s unhappy? And don't we as much want a remedy again&s;t the torment of mar|riage, as we thought we did again&s;t that of the devils?</P>

When I ob&s;erved M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. d'Aubigny ready to &s;ay &s;omething plea&s;ant upon &s;o merry a &s;ubject, I had a mind to pre&s;erve to him the merit of a gravity, which was not ordinary with him. Whereupon I immedi|ately took up the di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>"Of all the remedies one can u&s;e to alleviate the troubles of marriage, <HI>I know none &s;aid I to them,</HI> more &s;ure, nor more wi&s;ely practi&s;ed, than that of believi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">g one's &s;elf more happy than others; and to remain in this error, in ca&s;e one is mi&s;taken in it.

<P>Mon&s;ieur d'Aubigny, weary of his gravity, was now minded to end the conference; and after the u&s;ual civilities at parting, every one returned to his home, extremely well &s;atisfied.</P>
