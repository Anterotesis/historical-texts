<P>WHEN I wrote the following di&s;cour&s;e, I was indifferent about its being prin|ted; but as it has been mi&s;under&s;tood by &s;ome, the partiality of my friends per&s;waded me to &s;end it abroad into the world to &s;peak for it&s;elf. And I beg leave to ob&s;erve to the reader by way of preface, that my capital de&s;ign in this &s;ermon was to do honor to the military character, without keeping up tho&s;e dividing names, or par|ty di&s;tinctions of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> and <HI>American</HI> when applied to a general character; and that I might revive the true martial &s;pirit, which is &s;unk in this province much too low, for the pre&s;ent day.</P>
<P>IN illu&s;trating the importance of the mili|tary character, I con&s;ider the troops rai&s;ed in <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>America</HI> as joined in one <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> victorious Army,&mdash;enli&s;ted under one head,&mdash; engaged in, and pur&s;uing one common cau&s;e,&mdash;the mutual intere&s;t and &s;afety of the whole.</P>
<P>WHEN I &s;peak of the &s;kill or courage of any <HI>European</HI> troops or commanders, I do not mean to derogate any thing of the military honors of my dear country-men, or any of his Maje&s;ty's troops rai&s;ed in <HI>America</HI>;&mdash;their native courage has been too often tryed to leave any room to di&s;|pute it, or to doubt of its being equal to any that can be found throughout the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> dominions; and their improvement in the military arts, has
<PB N="ii" REF="012044_0006_0F896F08C74B5328">
been as great as could perhaps be expected, con|&s;idering the infancy of the country;&mdash;the va&s;t demand of labourers in the arts of agriculture and trade; &mdash; and the very little u&s;e we ever had for regular troops on this continent, till the la&s;t war.</P>
<P>WHEN I &s;peak of the pre&s;ervation of the public tranquillity, as connected with the military character, well &s;upported,&mdash;I do not mean to inti|mate as if I thought the keeping an armed force, within our thick inhabited towns or cities in a time of peace, was either &s;afe or nece&s;&s;ary to the pre&s;ervation of the public peace: But that the &s;tate &s;hould be able on every emergency to &s;end an army of well-di&s;ciplined troops, men of valour, expert in war, either into the field, or to the &s;ea-coa&s;t or frontiers, to with&s;tand or repel a foreign enemy, or if need be, aid, under the direction of the Laws, the civil powers at home, when the public peace is endangered or di&s;turbed by the &s;ons of violence.</P>
<P>IT is a hard que&s;tion, how wars became nece&s;&s;ary? &mdash; But in&s;tead of puzzling our|&s;elves about the origin of war, let us unite in ardent prayers to the Prince of peace, that he would ha&s;ten the happy time, according to the prophecy and the promi&s;e, when he &s;hall erect one univer&s;al kingdom of peace under the whole heavens, and reign from &s;ea to &s;ea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth.</P>

<HEAD>AN Artillery-Election Sermon.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>EXODUS XV.3.</HI></BIBL>
<P>The Lord is a man of war, the Lord is his name.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WAR is a political evil, which is become nece&s;&s;ary, upon the in|troduction of natural and moral evil: And will remain nece&s;&s;ary &s;o long as <HI>they</HI> are allowed to prevail in this degenerate world: Therefore the <HI>man of war</HI> is become an intere&s;ting and important character:&mdash;And though <HI>it</HI> connects a train of very gloomy ideas, in the human brea&s;t, e&s;pecially when in&s;pired with the genius of the go&s;pel, yet, from its importance, and the noble principles by which alone it can be &s;upported, it is become truly honorable.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="012044_0008_0F896F0A38D95458">THE honor of this important character, cannot ri&s;e higher, nor gain an attitude more &s;ublime, than <HI>that</HI> which it a&s;&s;umes in the &s;tyle of my text. <HI>The Lord is a man of war, the Lord is his name.</HI></P>
<P>FROM which words I &s;hall endeavour to vindicate the dignity and importance of the military character.</P>
<P>AS the words are found in that celebra|ted &s;ong of Mo&s;es, which he in&s;cribed to the Lord, who triumphed gloriou&s;ly over Pharaoh and his ho&s;t at the red-&s;ea; &s;o they are to be under&s;tood poetically. And the divine per&s;onage, who is called a man of war, who&s;e name is Jehovah, is probably the ble&s;&s;ed Me&s;&s;iah, then in the form of God, under who&s;e &s;pecial protection and guidance, as the con&s;tituted Lord of provi|dence, I&s;rael pa&s;&s;ed from a &s;tate of bondage in Egypt, through the red-&s;ea, &s;afe, as on dry-land, while Pharaoh's chariots, and his pur&s;uing ho&s;ts &s;ank amid&s;t the clo&s;ing bil|lows to the bottom, as a &s;tone, and were drowned in the mighty waters.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="012044_0009_0F896F0AF867E548">THE military character, in this connec|tion &s;tands in a very amiable, as well as eminent point of light.</P>
<P>THE dignity and importance of this character, has, I know, been the common profe&s;&s;ed &s;ubject of this day; yet, I will not &s;ay, it has been exhau&s;ted: For the dignity originates in <HI>him</HI> who&s;e perfections are infinite, and, its importance keeps pace with life, liberty, religion and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>THE &s;ubject remains inexhau&s;tible, and furni&s;hes &s;till, with new matter to &s;timu|late, direct and facilitate the duties of this <HI>Anniver&s;ary:</HI> And will continue to do &s;o, till the ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Millennium</HI> &s;hall take place, when the nations &s;hall, with one con&s;ent, beat their &s;words into plow-&s;hares, and their &s;pears into pruning hooks, and &s;hall learn war no more; but form under the gentle reign of the Prince of peace, one grand univer&s;al Monarchy of harmony and love.</P>
<P>TO be like our Father who is in heaven, or to re&s;emble the ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Immanuel,</HI> in tho&s;e characters which he a&s;&s;umed for our
<PB N="4" REF="012044_0010_0F896F0BB86721F8">
in&s;truction and imitation is the highe&s;t honor, and the true&s;t felicity we can a&s;pire to.</P>
<P>AND tho' the divine Being &s;eems to glory in the title, <HI>God of love and peace</HI>; and tho' the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us, his incarnate &s;on is emphatically the "<HI>prince of peace,</HI>" and came to make peace, and has left it in command, as the leading precept of chri&s;tianity, "follow peace with all men:" Yet &s;in having entered and fired the pa&s;&s;i|ons of men, and bid lu&s;t, ambition and fell di&s;cord, &s;pread wild di&s;order through the&s;e regions of mortality;&mdash; &s;ince &s;tern ty|ranny and cruel oppre&s;&s;ion, twin-brats of hell, extend their iron bands to en&s;lave the free-born mind, &s;aying, "bow down your &s;ouls that we may go over you;" &mdash;the God of peace &s;ounds an alarm and calls to arms! &mdash;to arms! And his divine Son, the meek and lowly, a&s;&s;umes the character in my text, the <HI>man of war.</HI></P>
<P>AND as a mighty Prince of meek maje&s;ty, he places him&s;elf at the head of his nume|rous ho&s;ts, and girds on the &s;word upon his thigh, with his bow and crown he
<PB N="5" REF="012044_0011_0F896F0C77D1C798">
marches on, conquering and to conquer. And to his enemies he proclaims
<Q>What have I to do with peace! I am not come to &s;end peace but a &s;word, and cur&s;ed be he that doth the work of the Lord de|ceitfully, cur&s;ed be he that with-holdeth his &s;word from blood:&mdash;Ble&s;&s;ed are they who do to their enemies as they have done to them&mdash;ble&s;&s;ed is he, who taketh and da&s;heth their little ones again&s;t the &s;tones.</Q>
&mdash;I &s;hudder at the&s;e la&s;t expre&s;&s;i|ons:&mdash;I would not mi&s;repre&s;ent the &s;acred text; nor do I mean to repre&s;ent the Divine Being, as laying a&s;ide the amiable character of the God of love, or as if he ever acted in oppo&s;ition to it; or as if the compa&s;&s;io|nate Je&s;us, that friend of mankind, delight|ed in blood and &s;laughter: An idea this, mo&s;t abhorrent of the Deity, and infinitely remote from the character, or from being any e&s;&s;ential part of that character I mean to honor. But when war becomes nece&s;&s;ary, through the lu&s;ts of men, God for the vin|dication of his own honor, and the defence of his peoples rights, con&s;ecrates the &s;word to religion, and
<Q>his right hand takes hold on vengeance;</Q>
&mdash;and having commi&s;&s;i|oned his eternal Son, to do all his dreadful
<PB N="6" REF="012044_0012_0F896F0D38894FF8">
work of judgment; He, as captain of the Lord's ho&s;ts, takes the field, and connects the man of <HI>war,</HI> with the chri&s;tian <HI>Hero,</HI> and makes the fidelity of the good &s;oldier, an e&s;&s;ential part of that religion which is founded on the immoveable ba&s;is of moral virtue and chri&s;tian grace&mdash;a part of that religion which unites love to God with be|nevolence to men.</P>
<P>THIS divine per&s;onage a&s;&s;umed and &s;up|ported the military character, e&s;pecially in the theocracy of the Jews, his own people, to whom he &s;tood in a political relation, as their Prince and governor, as well as re|deemer and Savior.</P>
<P>AND that he might &s;trengthen their faith, animate their courage, and &s;ecure to him|&s;elf their allegiance, he &s;tipulated with them the Sinai-covenant, and under the oecono|my of that covenant frequently appeared to them in human form, to anticipate his fu|ture incarnation.</P>
<P>AND He cho&s;e to appear &s;ometimes un|der the military character, that he might &s;upport its dignity, as in that remarkable
<PB N="7" REF="012044_0013_0F896F0DF67A9050">
in&s;tance, to Jo&s;hua, near the well of Jericho. For
<Q>it came to pa&s;s when Jo&s;hua was by Jericho, he lift up his eyes and looked, and behold their &s;tood a man over again&s;t him, with a drawn &s;word in his hand: and Jo&s;hua went unto him, and &s;aid un|to him, Art thou for us, or for our adver|&s;aries? And he &s;aid, Nay, but as captain of the ho&s;t of the Lord am I now come. And Jo&s;hua fell on his face to the earth, and did wor&s;hip, and &s;aith unto him, What &s;aith my Lord un|to his &s;ervant? And the captain of the Lord's ho&s;t &s;aid unto Jo&s;hua, loo&s;e thy &s;hoe from off thy foot, for the place whereon thou &s;tande&s;t is holy; and Jo&s;hua did &s;o.</Q> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>Now that this was a divine Per&s;onage who appeared to Jo&s;hua is obvious to all: He could not be a good Angel, for he ex|pre&s;&s;ly required a token of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion;&mdash;put off thy &s;hoe,&mdash; and urged it with this con&s;ideration, that the ground on which he &s;tood was holy&mdash;con&s;ecrated by his pre&s;ence; and he admits of an act of religious homage, "for Jo&s;hua fell on his face to the earth, and did wor&s;hip," which a good Angel would neither have required, or admitted. He could not be an evil Angel; for the appearance was in favor of Jo&s;hua, and his military operations, and &s;o Satan would be divided again&s;t him&s;elf, contrary to his &s;ettled principles of policy:&mdash;He could not be one of the human race, for his appearance was &s;upernatural, and his a&s;pect wore &s;uch evident marks of divi|nity that Jo&s;hua does not he&s;itate to call him his LORD (<HI>Heb.</HI>) ADONAI,&mdash;&s;upreme governor of all things.</P>
<P>AND it is equally evident, that this divine per&s;on was the Son of God; for he not only a&s;&s;umes the title Jehovah, but the leader and conductor of all the ho&s;ts of Jehovah, e&s;pecially the armies of I&s;rael, whom he had taken under his peculiar care and protection; for he is con&s;tituted head over all things, e&s;pecially tho&s;e that pertain to his Church and Kingdom;&mdash; and the Apo&s;tle Paul expre&s;&s;ly &s;ays, that he who conducted I&s;rael through the wilderne&s;s, and &s;upported them in their wars with the Canaanites was Je&s;us Chri&s;t, 1 Cor. 10.4.</P>
<P>AND he frequently appeared to others on great and &s;pecial oc|ca&s;ions, as to Abram, when he was about to call him from a &s;tate of idolatry, and to con&s;titute him head of the faithful&mdash; to Jacob when he was in danger of being &s;wallowed up by his envious brother;&mdash;to Mo&s;es in the burning bu&s;h; &mdash; and after his re&s;urrection and a&s;cention, to Saul in his way to Da|ma&s;cus;&mdash;and to his di&s;ciples when in great fear of the Jews, &amp;c.</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="012044_0014_0F896F0EB6DA7B00">AND as captain-general of all the ho&s;ts of heaven and earth, He mu&s;tered martialed, and marched them to the field of battle, when he plea&s;ed, for the defence and &s;al|vation of his cho&s;en people:&mdash;And under him they always proved &s;ucce&s;sful, and came off more than conquerors; for he formed vi&s;ible or invi&s;ible guards round about them that feared him, or were faith|ful in their allegiance to him.</P>
<P>AS captain of the ho&s;ts of the Lord, he promi&s;ed his people that he would fight all their battles for them, &s;o long as they &s;tea|dily adhered to him:&mdash;He would be as a
<Q>wall of fire round about them, and the glory in the mid&s;t of them:</Q>
He there|fore forbid them making tho&s;e war-like
<PB N="9" REF="012044_0015_0F896F10400CF850">
preparations which otherwi&s;e would have been ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for their defence and &s;afety.</P>
<P>UNDER this character he has all nature at command;&mdash;no clerk of the mu&s;ter-roll can call over the li&s;t of his forces: for the number of his armies is countle&s;s. The heavenly ho&s;ts:&mdash;the angelic legions are his cho&s;en troops: &mdash; The chariots of the Lord are twenty thou&s;and; thou&s;ands of Angels. If but one of the&s;e take the field under the direction and commi&s;&s;ion of his divine leader, the camp is &s;pread with more than an hundred and eighty thou&s;and &s;lain:&mdash; Next to the&s;e the &s;tarry legions, which be|long to his alarm-li&s;t, mu&s;ter, march, and fight in their cour&s;es, under his command, and di&s;comfit the enemies of his people. The clouds, winds, &s;torms, tempe&s;t, thun|der and hail, are but different battalions, and compo&s;e his army of ob&s;ervation, which he "re&s;erves again&s;t the day of battle and of war."</P>
<P>AND there is not an element, in&s;ect or reptile, but, when commi&s;&s;ioned by him, who is the Lord of ho&s;ts, may &s;tyle it&s;elf
<PB N="10" REF="012044_0016_0F896F1108CED260">
God's ho&s;t, and become "terrible as an army with banners:" As that reptile and in&s;ect-army did, the grand and figurative de&s;crip|tion of which, we have in the 2d Chapter of Joel.&mdash;The prophet Habakkuk de&s;cribes the military manoeuvres of this mighty warrior in a &s;tyle peculiar to him&s;elf:&mdash;
<Q>He came from Teman, and the holy one from mount Paran, and he went forth for the &s;alvation of his people. He marched through the land in indignation;&mdash;He thre&s;hed the heathen in his anger;&mdash;the &s;tubborn nations were cut in &s;under&mdash;the everla&s;ting mountains were &s;cattered, the immoveable hills bowed,&mdash;the river's ra|pid &s;tream pa&s;&s;ed on in &s;ilence,&mdash;the deep uttered her voice:&mdash;the &s;un &s;tood &s;till, amazed:&mdash;the moon hid her pale face:&mdash; the pillars of heaven &s;hook for fear, and the earth trembled to her center, while the God marched on in martial pomp, and di&s;played the honors of the man of war.</Q></P>
<P>THOUGH this divine man of war, has long &s;ince droped the political relation which he bore, as a prince or political Father to the I&s;raeliti&s;h nation, which
<PB N="11" REF="012044_0017_0F896F11B6B4D648">
relation terminated with the Sinai-covenant, yet he continues to &s;u&s;tain the military character with equal dignity, under the milder di&s;pen&s;ations of the covenant of grace. Here indeed he appears under the form of a &s;ervant;&mdash;the gentle Lamb of God: And in his general deportment he breathed nothing but love; and peace, and goodne&s;s; yet &s;uch rays of meek maje&s;ty broke forth through the cloud of humanity, as proclaimed him the
<Q>Son of God with power&mdash;the King of Zion, who had more than twelve legions of Angels at com|mand, and all nature obedient to his will.</Q></P>
<P>WHEN he was about to clo&s;e up the vi&s;ion, and to make an end of prophecy, he &s;hewed him&s;elf to his ancient apo&s;tle John, under the mo&s;t magnificent titles of a victorious commander:&mdash;In one point of view, we behold him mounted on a war-hor&s;e, with his bow and with his crown, to denote his martial &s;kill and royal dignity, and he rides on victorious, from one con|que&s;t to another; imparting the en&s;igns of victory to his faithful followers. In ano|ther point of light, he is repre&s;ented as leading forth the armies of heaven again&s;t
<PB N="12" REF="012044_0018_0F896F1278CFE648">
the enemies of his church, while on his robe and on the &s;word upon his thigh, is wrote "<HI>King of Kings and Lord of Lords;</HI>" to &s;ignify univer&s;al empire over all princes and potentates in earth and heaven.&mdash;Thus he rai&s;ed the military character to the highe&s;t dignity, which was the fir&s;t thing I had in view:&mdash;The next, is to illu&s;trate the utility and importance of this character to public happine&s;s.</P>
<P>THIS point is e&s;tabli&s;hed by the former: For if the military character is of &s;uch dignity, that, the incarnate Redeemer,
<Q>who is the brightne&s;s of the Father's glory,</Q>
has &s;een &s;it to a&s;&s;ume and act under it, through the varying modes of the theocracy, when in the form of God, and &s;upported it through the &s;tate of his incar|nation, when in the form of a &s;ervant, and &s;till continues to honor it, as the Lord of Sabaoth, and will, till he has gained the final conque&s;t over all the powers of earth and hell, when he will
<Q>re&s;ign the kingdom unto the Father, and God &s;hall be all in all;</Q>
then certainly, it mu&s;t not only be a character of the highe&s;t honor, but of the greate&s;t utility and im|portance
<PB N="13" REF="012044_0019_0F896F1337D61910">
to public happine&s;s: For happine&s;s is the great <HI>good;</HI>&mdash;to in&s;ure and promote <HI>this,</HI> was the beneficent de&s;ign of his mi&s;&s;ion, and the leading characters he a&s;&s;umed and acted under;&mdash;the grand point in view was, that he might defend the rights of his people, and ble&s;s the world with peace and happine&s;s. But that I might animate your hopes and invigorate the true principles of heroi&s;m implanted in your generous brea&s;ts, give me leave to point out to you, a few particulars, wherein public happine&s;s &s;tands connected with the military character, well &s;upported.</P>
<P>AS the military, is not an original cha|racter;&mdash; it became nece&s;&s;ary and impor|tant upon the introduction of &s;in; &s;o it mu&s;t be u&s;eful and important as long as &s;in corrupts the world;&mdash;fires the pa&s;&s;ions of men, and di&s;turbs the public tranquility.</P>
<P>IT is nece&s;&s;ary and u&s;eful for the defence of our lives, our liberties, property and peace. If the&s;e are dear and important, the military character is &s;o, as by <HI>that,</HI> the&s;e, under God are defended and pre&s;er|ved to us.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="012044_0020_0F896F13F8737E08">IT is nece&s;&s;ary, to with&s;tand the powers of hell;&mdash; to re&s;i&s;t the boundle&s;s ambition of tyrants;&mdash; to curb the lawle&s;s pride of nations, and the impetuous lu&s;ts of men. To the&s;e, where the military character has been wanting or not well &s;upported, life and liberty, &s;tates and kingdoms, have fell, devoted victims.</P>

<P>WE attempted to repel force by force, but the want of a thorough acquaintance with the art military, ob&s;tructed the councils of war at home, and the want of di&s;ciplined troops, who were bred to war, and who could well &s;upport the military character in the field, rendered our fir&s;t attempts abortive;&mdash;the con&s;equence of this was, we &s;aw our fortre&s;&s;es, taken from us;&mdash; our frontiers were depopulated and burnt, our wives ravi&s;hed and then butchered;&mdash; our daughters deflowered and led away captive, and our children confined in
