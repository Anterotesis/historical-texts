<HEAD>TO THE PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the eager welcome with which the former &s;eries of this incomparable lady's literary corre&s;pondence was re|ceived by the public, there is no room to doubt whether her poems, with the additional volume of her letters, will meet with a favourable reception.</P>
<P>Ever lively, witty, ea&s;y, &s;en&s;ible, and elevated above the common level of female capacities and female modes and forms,&mdash;nothing dull, nothing in&s;ipid or unentertaining, could po&s;&s;ibly fall from her pen. She was a philo&s;opher in &s;entiment, a morali&s;t in plea&s;ure, and a voluptuary in ta&s;te: in &s;ex a woman, in under&s;tanding a man. Pope gained nothing by his quarrel with this Amazon in wit; who, in return for &s;ome ill-natur'd in&s;inuations thrown at her, gave him the &s;evere&s;t poetical cha&s;ti&s;ement he ever received.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>ANECDOTE OF LADY MONTAGUE AND MR. POPE.</HEAD>
<P>&mdash;BY the publication of this lady's elegant let|ters, written during her travels in Europe, A&s;ia and Africa, her name, her wit, her abilities and fame, have been particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed in the polite circle of &s;en|timental entertainment&mdash;Elevated above the preci&s;ion of pru|dery and the little arts of hypocri&s;y, with which the weake&s;t and lea&s;t virtuous of her &s;ex are often ma&s;ked, &s;he had an at|tack made on her reputation by an infamous &s;tory&mdash;
<Q><L>[On eagles wings immortal &s;candals fly,</L>
<L>While virtuous actions are but born and die.]</L></Q>
as void of probability as any to be met with in the unbounded <HI>range</HI> of <HI>romance,</HI> at fir&s;t fabricated and indu&s;triou&s;ly propa|gated, as &s;he believed, by the celebrated mr. Pope, with whom &s;he had &s;ome literary di&s;putes. Under the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions our no|ble poete&s;s, from the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of injured innocence, pours out her &s;pirited invecttives again&s;t him in ver&s;es addre&s;&s;ed to the imitator of the fir&s;t &s;atire of the &s;econd book of Horace. [See Page 19.] How far the acrimony of her pen may be excu&s;ed or even ju&s;tified, we &s;ubmit to the judgment of the candid reader, for who&s;e information we have taken the liberty of &s;ubjoining an account of the ri&s;e and progre&s;s of that rancour which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the&s;e celebrated rivals, in the words of mr. Ayres, the profe&s;&s;ed panegyri&s;t of mr. Pope, the memoirs of who&s;e life and writings he publi&s;hed at London, in 1745&mdash;"A certain lady of quality (&s;ays he, vol. 2d, page 194 and 199) took offence&mdash;Now from one &s;tep of di&s;like and di&s;gu&s;t to another, there was a total mi&s;under&s;tanding be|tween mr. Pope and her; and as &s;he took all occa&s;ions to in|&s;inuate things to the world di&s;advantageous to mr. Pope; that he did not under&s;tand <HI>Greek,</HI> but was forc'd to hire per&s;ons to tran&s;late Homer, &amp;c.&mdash;&s;o he, on the other hand (as 'twas re|ported to her) gave him&s;elf great liberties about her; and great mockery was made, and much loud laughter, at the &s;to|ry of a vi&s;it it was pretended the &s;aid lady was permitted to make to the &s;eraglio, when her hu&s;band was amba&s;&s;ador at the Porte. It is certain, let the tale ari&s;e from whence it will, it was very &s;candalous, neither can we think (if true) that it
<PB N="4" REF="011340_0003_0F86A0C6077DA210">
could po&s;&s;ibly have ever come to their knowledge; for it is to be thought that the lady, for the &s;ake of her own fame, would never have divulged &s;o &s;trange a &s;ecret.&mdash;</P>
<P>"However, as mo&s;t &s;tories of the like nature do, it gained credit, and mo&s;t prodigiou&s;ly exa&s;perated the lady, who ne|glected no opportunity of rai&s;ing whoever &s;he could again&s;t Mr. Pope and his writings, imagining him the great di&s;per&s;er of this tale; and perhaps he was not entirely clear."&mdash;From the foregoing quotation, even in the opinion of mr. Ayres, mr. Pope's guilt may readily be inferred.&mdash;But if any reader yet he&s;itates to pronounce our literary heroine en|tirely innocent, mr. Ayres is at no lo&s;s to do it for him, when he adds "we think the lady's anger ju&s;t."&mdash;Yea the cele|brated <HI>&s;wan of Thames</HI> him&s;elf, according to his above men|tioned panegyri&s;t, is &s;aid to have regretted the part he acted towards this lady: his words are "mr. Pope, towards the latter end of his time, &s;aid that, &s;etting apart raillery and the love of &s;atire, he wi&s;hed he had never offended this lady."&mdash;Henceforward defamation will blu&s;h at the recital of &s;o ridicu|lous a &s;tory, which never exi&s;ted, but in the creative fancy of this fair lady's ungenerous &s;atyri&s;t.</P>
<LG>
<L>To a laugh never martyr an innocent name,</L>
<L>'Tis malice mo&s;t cruelly cool;</L>
<L>Nor plunge the cha&s;te lady in angui&s;h and &s;hame,</L>
<L>For the loude&s;t applau&s;e of a fool.</L>

<HEAD>Letter from Lady Mary W. Montague, to Mi&s;s&mdash;.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Girl,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have &s;o violent a cold, that I never was le&s;s qualified in my life for in&s;pecting the heavenly bodies, and mu&s;t content my&s;elf with the vulgar warmth of my dre&s;&s;ing room fire, to a corner of which I &s;hall be confined all this evening, and very glad to &s;ee you if you can attend me any time after your more learned employment.</P>
<P>If the moon is inhabited by mortals like us, and the mo&s;t important tran&s;actions among them are nothing more than kingdoms turned into common-wealths, and common-wealths into kingdoms, and the&s;e mighty events are produced there, as they are here, by tyranny or lu&s;t, I have no de&s;ire of being acquainted with its inhabitants, but can look down upon them as they do upon us. I have peeped behind the &s;cenes here more than contributes to my ea&s;e, and by examining the wires and mechani&s;m of the &s;hew, the entertainment has long &s;ince cea&s;ed. Who is any longer entertained with the hocus pocus man, when he knows how the tricks are performed? In &s;hort, my dear Girl, our mo&s;t plea&s;ing pur&s;uits become carrion by the time they are hunted down. I would not put you out of con|ceit with a world you are but ju&s;t beginning to enter into; but to prepare you to bear tho&s;e di&s;appointments common to all, but mo&s;t &s;everely felt by tho&s;e of your ca&s;t and mine, for I would willingly tack my&s;elf to any thing that is half &s;o good as I know you to be, and wi&s;h my&s;elf.</P>

<HEAD>VERSES<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The&s;e &s;evere Ver&s;es owe their birth to two lines in the fir&s;t Satire of the &s;econd Book of Horace, imitated by Mr. Pope, which were &s;uppo&s;ed to point at Lady Mary Wortley Montague, under the name of Sappho. We find by the Letters of Mr. Pope, vol. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, and tho&s;e of Lady Mary Wortley Montague late|ly publi&s;hed, that a friendly corre&s;pondence once &s;ub&s;i&s;ted be|tween the&s;e two Wits, which probably did not continue much later than her lady&s;hip's return into England in the year 1718. But the exact time when the quarrel between them commenced, and the circum&s;tances relating to it, are not ea&s;y, at this di&s;|tance of time, to di&s;cover. It is &s;aid in Mr. Pope's Life, (Bio|graphia Britannica, vol. 5, p. 3413) that he was charged with propagating a &s;candalous report concerning her lady&s;hip, which, it is added, perhaps he was not quite clear of. The note to that life in which this charge on the poet is to be found, has the name of Dr. Warburton annexed to it, and therefore, on his authority, may well be &s;uppo&s;ed not without foundation. If a conjecture may be allowed, it is not improbable that this was the occa&s;ion of their difference. With re&s;pect to the lines which produced the&s;e ver&s;es, Mr. Pope, in his letter to Lord Hervey, vol. 8. p. 196. ab&s;olutely di&s;claims any intention of ap|plying them to Lady Montague, <Q>In regard (&s;ays he) to the right honourable Lady, your Lord&s;hips friend, I was far from de&s;igning a per&s;on of her condition by a name &s;o derogatory to her as that of Sappho, a name pro&s;tituted to every infa|mous creature that ever wrote ver&s;e or novels. I prote&s;t I never applied that name to her in any ver&s;e of mine, public or private, and (I firmly believe) not in any letter or conver&s;a|tion.</Q> What degree of credit this a&s;&s;everation de&s;erves, mu&s;t be left to the reader's determination, only ob&s;erving, that Mr. Pope, was not very &s;crupulous in di&s;owning a character when the opinion of the Public was not in his favour. With equal, or more earne&s;tne&s;s, he denied that the de&s;cription of Timon's Villa was de&s;igned to expo&s;e that of a certain nobleman. In which particular, he has been unwarily given up by his Com|mentator, who, in the following note on the&s;e lines in the edition of 1751, &s;eems to acknowledge the fact.</P>
<Q><L>Another age &s;hall &s;ee the golden car</L>

<P><Q>Had the poet lived but three years longer, he had &s;een this prophecy fulfilled.</Q> It is to be remembered, that Ca|nons was &s;old about the time here fixed upon, and therefore this que&s;tion will naturally ari&s;e, What prophecy was fulfilled, if Mr Pope had not that place in his mind while he was writ|ing the before-mentioned Epi&s;tle? The Editor of his works, as if con&s;cious that he had done no &s;ervice to Mr. Pope's moral character, by the above note, has &s;ince altered it in the follow|ing manner: <Q>Had the poet lived three years longer, he had &s;een his <HI>general</HI> prophecy <HI>again&s;t all ill-judged magnifi|cence fulfilled in a very particular in&s;tance.</HI></Q></P></NOTE> addre&s;&s;ed to the IMITATOR OF THE FIRST SATIRE of the Second Book of HORACE.</HEAD>

<HEAD>EPISTLE from Arthur Grey, the Footman,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This man was footman to a gentleman who&s;e daughter, a married lady, he attempted to ravi&s;h. It appears by his trial, that he went into her room about four o'clock in the morning, armed with a pi&s;tol in one hand, and a drawn &s;word in the o|ther; and advancing to the bed &s;ide, threatned to murder her if &s;he made any noi&s;e. Upon a&s;king him what he meant by com|ing into her chamber in &s;uch a manner, he replied, that he in|tended to ravi&s;h her, for that he had entertained a violent love for her a long time, but as there was &s;o great a difference be|tween their fortunes, he de&s;paired of enjoying his wi&s;hes by any means but force. After &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance, the lady wrench|ed the pi&s;tol from his hand (he having laid down the &s;word) and rung the bell; upon which he ran away. He was indicted and convicted of a burglary, at the Old Bailey, in December 1721, but the &s;entence was not executed, for he was reprieved, and afterwards tran&s;ported.</NOTE> After his Condemnation for attempting a RAPE.</HEAD>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>January 13. 1716.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I FIND after all, by your letter of ye&s;terday, that Mrs. D&mdash;is re&s;olved to marry the old grea&s;y Curate. She was always High Church in an exce&s;&s;ive degree, and you know &s;he u&s;ed to &s;peak of Sacheve|rel as an Apo&s;tolick Saint, who was wor|thy to &s;it in the &s;ame place with St. Paul, if not a &s;tep above him. It is a matter however very doubtful to me, whether it is not &s;till more the <HI>man</HI> than the <HI>apo&s;tle</HI> that Mrs. D&mdash;looks to in the pre&s;ent alliance. Tho' at the age of forty, &s;he is, I a&s;&s;ure you, very far from being cold and in&s;en&s;ible; her fire may be covered with a&s;hes, but is not extingui&s;hed.&mdash;Don't be deceived my dear Lady, by that pru|di&s;h and &s;anctified air&mdash;Warm devoti|ons are no equivocal marks of warm pa&s;|&s;ions; be&s;ides I know it is a fact, (of which I have proofs in hand, which I will tell you by word of mouth) that our learned and holy prude is exceedingly di&s;po&s;ed to u&s;e the <HI>means,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed in the primi|tive command, let what will come of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> end&punc; the Curate in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eed is very filthy&mdash;
<PB N="4" REF="011340_0022_0F86A0DF75A44CC0">
Such a red, &s;pungy, watry no&s;e! Such a &s;quint! in &s;hort, he is ugly beyond ex|pre&s;&s;ion; and what ought naturally to ren|der him peculiarly diplea&s;ing to one of Mrs. D&mdash;'s con&s;titution and propen&s;ities, he is &s;tricken in years. Nor do I really know how they will live. He has but forty five pounds a year&mdash;&s;he but a trifling &s;um; &s;o that they are likely to fea&s;t upon love and ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory, which will be very empty food without a proper mixture of beef and pudding. I have, however, en|gaged our friend, who is the curate's land|lord, to give them a good lea&s;e; and if Mrs. D&mdash;, in&s;tead of &s;pending whole days in reading Collier, Hicks, and vile tran&s;lations of Plato and Epictetus, will but form the re&s;olution of taking care of her hou&s;e and minding her dairy, things may go tolerably. It is not likely that their <HI>tender loves</HI> will give them many <HI>&s;weet babes</HI> to provide for.</P>
<P>I met the lover ye&s;terday, going to the alehou&s;e in his dirty night-gown, with a book under his arm to entertain the club; and as Mrs. D&mdash;was with me at the time, I pointed out to her the charming creature: &s;he blu&s;hed and looked prim; but quoted a pa&s;&s;age out of Herodotus, in which it is &s;aid that the Per&s;ians wore long right gowns. There is really no more ac|counting for the ta&s;te in marriage of ma|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">y of our &s;ex than there is for the ape|tite

<P>As marriage produces children, &s;o chil|dren produce care, di&s;putes and wrang|ling, as it is &s;aid (at lea&s;t by old batche|lors and old maids) is one of the <HI>&s;weets</HI> of the conjugal &s;tate: you tell me that our friend Mrs.&mdash;is, at length, ble&s;&s;ed with a &s;on; and that her husband who is a great philo&s;opher, [if his own te&s;timony is to be depended upon] in&s;i&s;ts on her &s;uckling it her&s;elf. You ask my advice on this mat|ter; and to give it you frankly, I really think that Mr&mdash;'s demand is unrea&s;on, able, as his wife's con&s;titution is tender, and her temper fretful. A true philo&s;opher would con&s;ider the&s;e circum&s;tances, but a pedant is always throwing his &s;y&s;tem in your face, and applies it equally to all things, times and places, ju&s;t like a taylor, who would make a coat out of his own head, without any regard to the bulk or figure of the per&s;on that mu&s;t wear it. All tho&s;e fine&punc; &s;pun arguments that he has drawn from na|ture to &s;top your mouths, weigh, I mu&s;t own to you, but very little with me. This &s;ame <HI>Nature</HI> is indeed a &s;pecious word, nay there is a great deal in it if it is properly under&s;tood and applied, but I cannot bear to hear people u&s;ing it to ju&s;tify what com|mon &s;en&s;e mu&s;t di&s;avow. Is not nature modified by art in many things? Was it

I do think that the milk of &s;uch a cow or of a nur&s;e that came as near it as po&s;&s;ible, would be likely to nouri&s;h the young &s;quire much better than hers. If it be true that the child &s;ucks in the mo|ther's pa&s;&s;ions with her milk, this is a &s;trong argument in favour of the cow, unle&s;s you may be afraid that the young &s;quire may become a calf; but how many calves are there both in &s;tate and church, who have been brought up with their mother's milk?</P>

<HEAD>To the Abbot&mdash;.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Vienna,</HI> <DATE>January 2, O. S. 1717.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I AM really almo&s;t tired with the life of Vienna. I am not, indeed, an enemy to di&s;&s;ipation and hurry, much le&s;s to amu&s;e|ment and plea&s;ure; but I cannot endure long, even plea&s;ure, when it is fettered, with formality, and a&s;&s;umes the air of &s;y&s;|tem. 'Tis true, I have had here &s;ome ve|ry agreeable connexions, and what will per|haps &s;urpri&s;e you. I have particular plea|&s;ure in my Spani&s;h acquaintances. Count Orope&s;a and General Puebla the&s;e two noblemen are much in the good graces of the Emperor, and yet they &s;eem to be brewing mi&s;chief. The court of Madrid cannot reflect without pain upon the terri|tories that were cut off from the Spani&s;h monarchy by the peace of Utrecht, and it &s;eems to be looking wi&s;hfully out for an opportunity of getting them back again. That is a matter about which I trouble my&s;elf very little; let the court be in the right or in the wrong, I like mightily the two Counts its mini&s;ters. I dined with them both &s;ome days ago at Count Wurm|brand's, an Aulic coun&s;ellor and a man of
<PB N="9" REF="011340_0024_0F86A0E3E4D43518">
letters, who is univer&s;ally e&s;teemed here. But the fir&s;t man in this court, in point of knowledge and abilities, is certainly the Count Sch&s;ick, High Chancellor of Bohe|mia, who&s;e immen&s;e reading is accompa|nied with a fine ta&s;te and a &s;olid judgment; he is a declared enemy to Prince Eugene, and a warm firiend to the hone&s;t hot head|ed Mar&s;hal Staremberg. One of the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed men I have &s;een at Vienna is the young Count Tarrocco, who accom|panies the amiable Prince of Portugal. I am almo&s;t in love with them both and won|der to &s;ee &s;uch elegant manners, and &s;uch free and generous &s;entiments in two young men who have hitherto &s;een nothing but their own country. The count is ju&s;t &s;uch a Roman Ca|tholick as you; he &s;ucceeds greatly with the-devout beauties here; his fir&s;t overtures in gal|lantry are di&s;gui&s;ed under the lu&s;cious &s;trains of &s;piritual love, that were &s;ung formerly by the &s;ublimely voluptuous Fenelon and the tender madam Guion, who turned the fire of carnal love to divine objects; thus the Count begins with the <HI>&s;pirit,</HI> and ends ge|nerally with the <HI>fle&s;h,</HI> when he makes his addre&s;&s;es to holy virgins.</P>
<P>I made acquaintance ye&s;terday with the famous poet Rou&s;&s;eau, who lives here un|der the peculiar protection of Prince Eu|gene, by who&s;e liberality he &s;ub&s;i&s;ts. He pa&s;&s;es here for a free thinker, and, what is &s;till wor&s;e in my e&s;teem, for a man who&s;e
<PB N="10" REF="011340_0025_0F86A0E516D98C60">
heart does not feel the encomiums he gives to virtue and honour in his poems. I like his odes mightily they are much &s;uperior to the lyrick productions of our Engli&s;h po|ets, few of whom have made any figure in that kind of poetry. I don't find that learn|ed men abound here; there is indeed a prodigious number of Alchymi&s;ts at Vien|na; the <HI>philo&s;ophers &s;tone</HI> is the great ob|ject of zeal and &s;cience; and tho&s;e who have more reading and capacity than the vulgar, have tran&s;ported their &s;uper&s;tition (&s;hall I call it?) or fanatici&s;m from religi|on to chymi&s;try; and they believe in a new kind of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, which is de&s;igned to make the laity as rich as the other kind has made the prie&s;thood. This pe&s;tilential pa&s;&s;ion has already ruin|ed &s;everal great hou&s;es. There is &s;carcely a man of opulence or fa&s;hion, that has not an Alchymi&s;t in his &s;ervice, and even the emperor is &s;uppo&s;ed to be no enemy to this folly in &s;ecret, tho' he has pretended to di&s;courage it in publick.</P>
<P>Prince Eugene was &s;o polite as to &s;hew me his library ye&s;terday; we found him attended by Rou&s;&s;eau, and his favourite Count Bonneval, who is a man of wit, and is here thought to be a very bold enter prizing &s;pirit. The library, tho' not very ample, is well cho&s;en; but as the prince will admit into it no editions but what are beautiful and plea&s;ing to the eye, and there
<PB N="11" REF="011340_0025_0F86A0E516D98C60">
are neverthele&s;s numbers of excellent books that are but indifferently printed, this finikin and fopi&s;h ta&s;te makes many di&s;agreeable cha&s;ms in this collection. The books are pompou&s;ly bound in Turkey leather, and two of the mo&s;t famous bookbinders of Paris were expre&s;sly &s;ent for to do this work Bonneval plea&s;antly told me that there were &s;everal quarto's on the art of war, that were bound with the skins of <HI>Spahis</HI> and <HI>Jani&s;&s;aries;</HI> and this je&s;t, which was indeed elegant, rai&s;ed a &s;mile of plea&s;ure on the grave countenance of the famous warrior. The Prince, who is a connoi&s;eur in the fine arts, &s;hewed me, with particu|lar plea&s;ure, the famous collection of portraits that formerly belonged to Fou|quet, and which he purcha&s;ed at an exce&s;|&s;ive price. He has augmented it with a con&s;iderable number of new acqui&s;itions, &s;o that he has now in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;uch a collection in that kind as you will &s;carcely find in any ten cabinets in Europe. If I told you the number, you would &s;ay that I made an indi&s;creet u&s;e of the permi&s;&s;ion to lie, which is more or le&s;s given to tra|vellers by the indulgence of the candid.</P>
<P>Count Tarrocco is ju&s;t come in&mdash;He is the only per&s;on I have excepted this morning in my general order to receive no company.&mdash;I think I &s;ee you &s;mile,&mdash;but I am not &s;o far gone as to &s;tand in need of ab&s;olution; tho', as the human

heart is deceitful, and the Count very a|greeable, you may think that even tho' I &s;hould not want an ab&s;olution, I would neverthele&s;s be glad to have an indul|gence.&mdash;No &s;uch thing.&mdash;However, as I am a heretick, and you no confe&s;|&s;or, I &s;hall make no declarations on this head.&mdash;The de&s;ign of the Count's vi&s;it is a ball;&mdash;more plea&s;ure&mdash;I &s;hall be &s;urfeited.</P>

<P>WHEN I wrote to you la&s;t, Belgrade was in the hands of the Turks; but at this pre&s;ent moment, it has changed ma&s;ters, and is in the hands of the Im|periali&s;ts. A Jani&s;&s;ary who in nine days, and yet without any wings but what a pannick terror &s;eems to have furni&s;hed, arrived at Con&s;tantinople from the army of the Turks before Belgrade, brought Mr. W&mdash;the news of a compleat vic|tory obtained by the imperiali&s;ts, com|manded by prince Eugene, over the Ot|toman troops. It is &s;aid the Prince has di&s;covered great conduct and valour in this action, and I am particularly glad

that the voice of glory and duty has call'd him from the&mdash;<HI>(here &s;everal words of the manu&s;cript are effaced.)</HI>&mdash;Two days after the battle the town &s;urrendered. The con&s;ternation, which this defeat has occa&s;ion|ed here, is inexpre&s;&s;ible; and the Sultan apprehending a revolution from the re|&s;entment and indignation of the people, fomented by certain leaders, has begun his goodly precautions after the goodly fa&s;hi|on of his ble&s;&s;ed government, by order|ing &s;everal per&s;ons to be &s;trangled who were the objects of his royal &s;u&s;picion. He has al&s;o ordered his trea&s;urer to ad|vance &s;ome months pay to the Jani&s;&s;aries, which &s;eems the le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary, as their con|duct has been bad in this campaign, and their licentious ferocity &s;eems pretty well tamed by the publick contempt, &s;uch of them as return in &s;traggling and fugitive parties to the metropolis, have not &s;pirit nor credit enough to defend them&s;elves from the in&s;ults of the mob; the very chil|dren taunt them and the populace &s;pit in their faces as they pa&s;s. They refu&s;ed during the battle to lend their a&s;&s;i&s;tance to &s;ave the baggage and the military che&s;t, which however were defended by the Ba|&s;haws and their retinue while the Jani&s;|&s;aries and &s;pahis were nobly employed in plundering their own camp.</P>
<P>You &s;ee here that I give you a very <HI>hand&s;ome</HI> return for your obliging letter.
<PB N="14" REF="011340_0027_0F86A0E7088A2070">
You entertain me with a mo&s;t agreeable ac|count of your amiable connexions with men of letters and ta&s;te, and of the deli&s;cious mo|ments you pa&s;s in their &s;ociety under the rural &s;hade; and I exhibit to you in return the barbarous &s;pectacles of Turks and Ger|mans cutting one another's throats. But what can you expect from &s;uch a country as this from which the mu&s;es have fled, from which letters &s;eem eternally bani&s;h|ed, and in which you &s;ee, in private &s;cenes, nothing pur&s;ued as happine&s;s but the refinements of an indolent voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, and where tho&s;e who act upon the pub|lick theatre live in uncertainty, &s;u&s;picion, and terror. Plea&s;ure to which I am no e|nemy, when it is duly &s;ea&s;oned and o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> a good compo&s;ition, is &s;urely here of the cloying kind. Veins of wit, elegant con|ver&s;ation ea&s;y commerce, are unknown among the Turks; and yet they &s;eem ca|pable of all the&s;e, if the vile &s;pirit of their government did not &s;tifle genius, damp curio&s;ity, and &s;uppre&s;s an hundred pa&s;&s;ions, that embelli&s;h and render life agreeable. The lu&s;cious pa&s;&s;ion of the Seraglio is the only one almo&s;t that is gratified here to the full, but it is blended &s;o with the &s;urly &s;pirit of de&s;poti&s;m in one of the parties, and with the dejection and anxiety which this &s;pirit produces in the other, that to one of my way of thinking it cannot appear otherwi&s;e than as a very mixed kind of

enjoyment. The women here are not in|deed, &s;o clo&s;ely confined as many have related; they enjoy a high degree of li|berty even in the bo&s;om of &s;ervitude, and they have methods of eva&s;ion and di&s;gui&s;e that are very favourable to gallanty; but after all, they are &s;till under unea&s;y ap|prehen&s;ions of being di&s;covered; and a di&s;|covery expo&s;es them to the mo&s;t mer|cile&s;s rage of jealou&s;y, which is here a mon&s;ter that cannot be &s;atiated but with blood. The magnificence and riches that reign in the apartments of the ladies of fa&s;hion here, &s;eem to be one of their chief plea&s;ures, joined with their retinue of fe|male &s;laves, who&s;e mu&s;ick dancing and dre&s;s amu&s;e them highly; but there is &s;uch an air of form and &s;tiffne&s;s amid&s;t this grandeur, as hinders it from plea&s;ing me at long run, however I was dazzled with it at fir&s;t &s;ight. This &s;tiffne&s;s and formality of manners are peculiar to the Turki&s;h ladies; for the Grecian belles are of quite another character and complex|ion; with them plea&s;ure appears in more engaging forms, and their per&s;ons, man|ners, conver&s;ation, and amu&s;ements are ve|ry far from being de&s;titute of elegance and ea&s;e,&mdash;</P>

Such a po&s;t as that, and &s;uch a wife as the Counte&s;s, do not &s;eem to be, in prudence eligible, for a man that is a&s;thmatick; and we may &s;ee the day when he will be heartily glad to re&s;ign them both. It is well that he laid a&s;ide the thoughts of the voluminous dictionary of which I have heard you or &s;omebody el&s;e frequently make mention. But no more on that &s;ubject; I would not have &s;aid &s;o much, were I not a&s;&s;ured that this letter will come &s;afe and unopened to hand.

fate; and I cannot well form a notion of that &s;piritual and extatick joy that is mixed with &s;ighs, groans, hunger and the other complicated mi&s;eries of mo|na&s;tick di&s;cipline.

The pro|found &s;ilence that is enjoined upon the monks of <HI>La Trappe,</HI> is a &s;ingular cir|cum&s;tance of their un&s;ociable and unnatu|ral di&s;cipline; and were this injunction ne|ver to be di&s;pen&s;ed with, it would be needle&s;s to vi&s;it them in any other cha|racter than as a collection of &s;tatues; but the &s;uperior of the convent &s;u&s;pended, in our favour, that rigorous law, and allow|ed 'one of the mutes to conver&s;e with me, and an&s;wer a few di&s;creet que&s;tions.

<P>I mu&s;t not forget to tell you that be|fore I came to this mona&s;tery I went to &s;ee the burning mountains near Fie|renzuola, of which the naturali&s;ts &s;peak as a great curio&s;ity. The flame it &s;ends

forth is without &s;moke, and re&s;embles brandy &s;et on fire. The ground about it is well cultivated, and the fire appears on|ly in one &s;pot where there is a cavity, who&s;e circumference is but &s;mall, but in it are &s;everal crevices who&s;e depths are unknown. It is remarkable that when a piece of wood is thrown into this cavi|ty, tho it cannot pa&s;s thro' the crevices, yet it is con&s;umed in a moment, and that though the ground about it be perfectly cold, yet if a &s;tick be rubbed with any force again&s;t it, it emits a flame, which how|ever, is neither hot nor durable like that of the volcano. If you de&s;ire a more cir|cum&s;tantial account of this phenomenon, and have made a &s;ufficient progre&s;s in Ita|lian to read father Carazzi's de&s;cription of it, you need not be at a lo&s;s, for I have &s;ent this de&s;cription to Mr. F&mdash;, and you have only to ask it of him. After ob&s;erving the volcano, I &s;crambled up all the neighbouring hills, partly on hor&s;e|back, partly on foot, but could find no ve&s;tige of fire in any of them; though common report would make one believe that they all contain volcano's,</P>
<P>I hope you have not taken it in your head to expect from me a de&s;cription of the famous gallery here, where I arrived on Thur&s;day at noon; this would be requir|ing a volume in&s;tead of a letter; be&s;ides I have as yet &s;een but a part of this im|men&s;e

trea&s;ure, and I propo&s;e employing &s;ome weeks more to &s;urvey the whole. You cannot imagine any &s;ituation more agreeable than Florence. It lies in a fertile and &s;miling valley watered by the Arno which runs thro' the city, and nothing can &s;urpa&s;s the beauty and magnificence of its publick buildings, particularly the ca|thedral, who&s;e grandeur filled me with a|&s;toni&s;hment. The palaces, &s;quares, foun|tains, &s;tatues, bridges, do not only carry an a&s;pect full of elegance and greatne&s;s, but di&s;cover a ta&s;te quite different, in kind, from that which reigns in the publick edifices in other countries. The more I &s;ee of Italy, the more I am per&s;uaded that the Italians have a &s;tile (if I may u&s;e that expre&s;&s;ion) in every thing, which di&s;tingui&s;hes them almo&s;t e&s;&s;entially from all other Europeans. Where they have got it,&mdash;whether from natural genius or ancient imitation and inheritance, I &s;hall not examine; but the fact is cer|tain. I have been but one day in the gallery, that amazing repo&s;itory of the mo&s;t precious remains of antiquity, and which alone is &s;ufficient to immortalize the illu&s;trious hou&s;e of Medicis, by whom it was built and enriched as we now &s;ee it. I was &s;o impatient to &s;ee the fa|mous Venus of Medicis, that I went ha&s;tily thro' &s;ix apartments in order to get a &s;ight of this divine figure, purpo&s;ing

when I had &s;atisfied this ardent curio&s;ity, to return and view the re&s;t at my lei&s;ure. As I indeed pa&s;&s;ed thro' the great room which contains the ancient &s;tatues, I was &s;topped &s;hort at viewing the Antinous, which they had placed near that of Adrian, to revive the remembrance of their pre|po&s;terous loves, which I &s;uppo&s;e the Flo|rentines rather look upon as an object of envy, than of horror and di&s;gu&s;t. This &s;ta|tue, like that of the Venus de Medicis, &s;purns de&s;cription: &s;uch figures my eyes never beheld&mdash;I can now under&s;tand that Ovid's comparing a fine woman a fine woman to a &s;tatue, which I formerly thought a very di&s;obliging &s;imilitude, was the nice&s;t and highe&s;t piece of flattery. The Antinous is entirely naked, alll its parts are bigger than nature; but the whole, taken together, and the fine attitude of the figure carry &s;uch an expre&s;&s;ion of ea&s;e, elegance and grace, as no words can de&s;cribe. When I &s;aw the Venus I was wrapt in wonder,&mdash;and I could not help ca&s;ting a thought back upon Antinous. They ought to be placed together. They are worthy of each other&mdash;If marble could &s;ee and feel, the &s;eparation might be prudent,&mdash;if it could only <HI>&s;ee,</HI> it would certainly lo&s;e its coldne&s;s and learn to feel, and in &s;uch a ca&s;e the charms of the&s;e two figures would produce an effect quite oppo&s;ite to that of the Gor|gon's

head, which turned fle&s;h into &s;tone. Did I pretend to de&s;cribe to you the Ve|nus, it would only &s;et your imagination at work to form ideas of her figure, and your idea's would no more re&s;emble that figure, than the Portugue&s;e face of Mi&s;s N&mdash;who has enchanted our knight, re&s;embles the &s;weet and graceful countenance of la|dy&mdash;his former flame. The de&s;cription of a face or figure is a needle&s;s thing as it never conveys a true idea, it only gra|tifies the imagination with a fanta&s;tick one, until the real one is &s;een. So, my dear, if you have a mind to form a true notion of the divine form, and features of the Venus and Antinous, come to Florence.</P>
<P>I would be glad to oblige you and your friend Vertue by executing your commi&s;|&s;ion with re&s;pect to the sketches of Ra|phaels cartoons at Hampton-Court; but I cannot do it to my &s;atisfaction. I have, indeed, &s;een in the Grand Dukes collection, four pieces, in which that won|derful arti&s;t had thrown freely from his pencil the fir&s;t thoughts and rude lines of &s;ome of the&s;e compo&s;itions; and as the fir&s;t thoughts of a great genius are preci|ous, the&s;e pieces attracted my curio&s;ity in a particular manner; but when I went to examine them clo&s;ely, I found them &s;o damaged and effaced, that they did not at all an&s;wer my expectation.

In&s;tead of employ|ing their art to pre&s;erve the ma&s;terpieces of antiquity, they have endeavoured to de|&s;troy and efface many of them.

<HEAD>LETTER LVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD>TO Mr. P&mdash;.</HEAD>
<P>I Have been running about Paris at a &s;trange rate with my &s;i&s;ter, and &s;trange &s;ights have we &s;een. They are at lea&s;t &s;trange &s;ights to me, for after having been accu&s;tomed to the gravity of Turks, I can &s;carcely look with an ea&s;y and familiar a&s;pect at the levi|ty and agility of the airy phantoms that are dancing about me here, and I often think that I am at a puppet-&s;hew amid&s;t the repre&s;entations of real life. I &s;tare pro|digiou&s;ly but no body remarks it, for eve|ry body &s;tares here; &s;taring is alamode&mdash;there is a &s;tare of attention and <HI>inter&eacute;t,</HI> a &s;tare of curio&s;ity, a &s;tare of expectation, a

&s;tare of &s;urprize, it would greatly amu&s;e you to &s;ee what trifling objects excite all this &s;taring. This &s;taring would have rather a &s;olemn kind of air, were it not alleviated by grinning, for at the end of a &s;tare there comes always a grin, and very com|monly the entrance of a gentleman or la|dy into a room is accompanied with a grin, which is de&s;igned to expre&s;s compla|cence and &s;ocial plea&s;ure, but really &s;hews nothing more than a certain contortion of mu&s;cles that mu&s;t make a &s;tranger laugh really, as they laugh artificially. The French grin is equally remote from the chearful &s;erenity of a &s;mile, and the cordial mirth of an hone&s;t Engli&s;h hor&s;e-laugh. I &s;hall not perhaps &s;tay here long enough to form a ju&s;t idea of French manners and characters, tho' this I believe would require but little &s;tudy, as there is no great depth in either. It appears, on a &s;uperficial view to be a frivolous re&s;tle&s;s and agreeable people. The Abbot is my guide, and I could not ea&s;ily light upon a better; he tells me that here the women form the character of the men, and I am convinc|ed in the per&s;ua&s;ion of this by every com|pany into which I enter. There &s;eems here to be no intermediate &s;tate between infancy and manhood; for as &s;oon as the boy has quit his leading-&s;trings, he is &s;et agog in the world; the ladies are his tu|tors, they make the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions, which
<PB N="28" REF="011340_0034_0F86A07E024EE1A0">
generally remain, and they render the men ridiculous by the imitation of their humours and graces, &s;o that dignity in manners is a rare thing here before the age of &s;ixty. Does not King David &s;ay &s;omewhere, that <HI>Man walketh in a vain &s;hew?</HI> I think he does, and I am &s;ure this is peculiarly true of the French man,&mdash;but he walks merrily and &s;eems to enjoy the vi&s;ion, and may he not therefore be e&s;teemed more happy than many of our &s;olid thinkers who&s;e brows are furrowed by deep reflection, and who&s;e wi&s;dom is &s;o often clothed with a mi&s;ty mantle of &s;pleen and vapours?</P>
<P>What delights me mo&s;t here is a view of the magnificence often accompanied with ta&s;te that reigns in the King's palaces and gardens; for tho' I don't admire much the architecture, in which there is great irregularity amd want of proportion, yet the &s;tatues, paintings and other deco|rations afford me high entertainment. One of the pieces of antiquity that &s;truck me mo&s;t in the gardens of Ver&s;ailles was the famous Colo&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">an &s;tatue of Jupi|ter, the workman&s;hip of Myron, which Mark Anthony carried away from Samos, and Augu&s;tus ordered to be placed in the Capitol. It is of pariah marble, and tho' it has &s;uffered in the ruin of time it &s;till pre&s;erves &s;triking lines of maje&s;ty. But &s;urely if marble could feel, the God would

frown with a generous indignation to &s;ee him&s;elf tran&s;ported from the Capi|tol into a French garden; and after hav|ing received the homage of the Roman emperors who laid their laurels at his feet when they returned from their conque&s;ts, to behold now nothing but frizzled beaus pa&s;&s;ing by him with indifference.</P>
<P>I propo&s;e &s;etting out &s;oon from this place, &s;o that you are to expect no more letters from this &s;ide of the water; be&s;ides I am hurried to death, and and my head &s;wims with that va&s;t variety of objects which I am obliged to view with &s;uch rapidity the &s;hortne&s;s of my time not allowing me to examine them at my lei&s;ure. There is here an exce&s;&s;ive prodigality of ornaments and decorations, that is ju&s;t the oppo&s;ite extreme to what appears in our royal gar|dens; this prodigality is owing to the le|vity and incon&s;tancy of the French ta&s;te, which always pants after &s;omething new, and thus heaps ornament upon ornament without end or mea&s;ure.

<HEAD>LETTER LVIII. To Count&mdash;.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Tran&s;lated from the French.</HEAD>
<P>I AM charmed, &s;ir, with your obliging letter; and you may perceive by the largene&s;s of my paper, that I intend to give punctual an&s;wers to all your que&s;ti|ons, at lea&s;t if my French will permit me; for as it is a language I do not under&s;tand to perfection, &s;o I much fear, that, for want of expre&s;&s;ions, I &s;hall be quickly o|bliged to fini&s;h. Keep in mind, therefore, that I am writing in a foreign language; and be &s;ure to attribute all the impertinen|cies and triflings dropping from my pen, to the want of proper words for declaring my thoughts, but by no means to dulne&s;s or natural levity.</P>
<P>The&s;e conditions being thus agreed and &s;ettled, I begin with telling you, that you have a true notion of the Alcoran, con|cerning which the Greek prie&s;ts (who are the greate&s;t &s;coundrels in the univer&s;e) have invented out of their own heads a thou&s;and ridiculous &s;tories, in order to decry the law of Mahomet; to run it down, I &s;ay, without any examination,
<PB N="31" REF="011340_0035_0F86A07EB9B57FA0">
or &s;o much as letting the people read it; being afraid that if once they began to &s;ift the defects of the Alcoran, they might not &s;top there, but proceed to make u&s;e of their judgment, about their own legends and fictions. In effect, there is nothing &s;o like as the fables of the Greeks and of the Mahometans; and the la&s;t have multitudes of &s;aints, at who&s;e tombs miracles are by them &s;aid to be daily performed; nor are the accounts of the lives of tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ed Mu&s;&s;elmen much le&s;s &s;tuffed with extravagancies, than the &s;piritual romances of the Greek Pa|pas.</P>
<P>As to your next enquiry, I a&s;&s;ure you 'tis certainly fal&s;e, though commonly be|lieved in our parts of the world, that Ma|homet excludes women from any &s;hare in a future happy &s;tate. He was too much a gentleman, and loved the fair &s;ex too well, to u&s;e them &s;o barbarou&s;ly. On the con|trary, he promi&s;es a very fine paradi&s;e to the Turki&s;h women. He &s;ays, indeed, that this paradi&s;e will be a &s;eparate place from that of their husbands; but I, fancy the mo&s;t part of them won't like it the wor&s;e for that; and that the re|gret of this &s;eparation will not rende their paradi&s;e the le&s;s agreeable. It re|mains to tell you, that the virtues which Mahomet requires of the women, to me|rit the enjoyment of future happine&s;s, are
<PB N="32" REF="011340_0036_0F86A07F8DAC88B8">
not to live in &s;uch a manner as to be|come u&s;ele&s;s to the world, but to employ them&s;elves as much as po&s;&s;ible, in making little Mu&s;&s;ulmans, The virgins who die virgins, and the widows who marry not again, dying in mortal &s;in, are excluded out of paradi&s;e: For women, &s;ays he not being capable to manage the affairs of &s;tate, nor to &s;upport the fatigues of war, God has not ordered them to govern or reform the world; but he has entru&s;ted them with an office which is no le&s;s honou|ble, even that of multiplying the human race: and &s;uch as&punc; out of malice or la|zine&s;s, do not make it their bu&s;ine&s;s to bear or breed children, fulfill not the duty of their vocation, and rebel again&s;t the commands of God. Here are maxims for you, prodigiou&s;ly contrary to tho&s;e of your convents. What will become of your St. Catharines, your St. There&s;as, your St. Claras, and the whole bead roll of your holy virgins and widows? who, if they are to be judged by this &s;y&s;tem of virtue, will be found to have been infamous creatures, that pa&s;&s;ed their whole lives in the mo&s;t abominable libertini&s;m.</P>
<P>I know not what your thoughts may be concernin a doctrine &s;o extraordinary with re&s;pect to us; but I can truly inform you, &s;ir, that the Turks are not &s;o igno|rant as we fancy them to be, in mat|ters of politicks, or philo&s;ophy, or even
<PB N="33" REF="011340_0036_0F86A07F8DAC88B8">
of gallantry. 'Tis true that military di&s;|cipline, &s;uch as is now practi&s;ed in Chri|&s;tendom, does not mightily &s;uit them. A long peace has plunged them into an uni|ver&s;al &s;loth. Content with their condition, and accu&s;tomed to boundle&s;s luxury, they are become great enemies to all manner of fatigues. But to make amends, the &s;ci|ences flouri&s;h among them. The effendis (that is to &s;ay, the learned) do very well de&s;erve this name: They have no more faith in the in&s;pirations of Mahomet, than in the infallibility of the Pope. They make a frank profe&s;&s;ion of dei&s;m among them&s;elves, or to tho&s;e they can tru&s;t, and never &s;peak of their law but as of a po|litick in&s;titution, fit now to be ob&s;erved by wi&s;e men, however at fir&s;t introduced by politicians and enthu&s;ia&s;ts.</P>
<P>If I remember right, I think I have told you in &s;ome former letter, that at Belgrade we lodged with a great and rich Effendi, a man of wit and learning, and of a very agreeable humour. We were in his hou&s;e about a month, and he did con&s;tantly eat with us, drinking wine with|out any &s;cruple. As I rallied him a little on this &s;ubject, he an&s;wered me, &s;miling, that all creatures in the world were made for the plea&s;ure of man; and that God would not have let the vine grow, were it a &s;in to ta&s;te of its juice: but that ne|verthele&s;s the law, which forbids the u&s;e
<PB N="34" REF="011340_0037_0F86A083E47E3578">
of it to the vulgar, was very wi&s;e, becau&s;e &s;uch &s;ort of folks have not &s;en&s;e enough to take it with moderation. This Effendi appeared no &s;tranger to the parties that prevail among us: nay, he &s;eemed to have &s;ome knowledge of our religious di&s;|putes, and even of our writers, and I was &s;urpri&s;ed to hear him ask among other things how Mr. Toland did?</P>
<P>My paper, large as it is, draws towards an end. That I may not go beyond its limits, I mu&s;t leap from religions to tu|lips, concerning which you ask me news. Their mixture produces &s;urprizing effects But what is to be ob&s;erved mo&s;t &s;urpriz|ing, is the experiments of which you &s;peak concerning animals, and which is tried here every day. The &s;uburbs of Pera, Jophana, and Galata, are collecti|ons of &s;trangers from all countries of the univer&s;e. They have &s;o often intermar|ried, that this forms &s;everal races of peo|ple, the odde&s;t imaginable, there is not one &s;ingle family of natives, that can va|lue it&s;elf on being unmixed. You fre|quently &s;ee a per&s;on, who&s;e father was born a Grecian, the mother an Italian, the grandfather a Frenchman, the grand|mother an Armenian, and their ance&s;tors Engli&s;h, Mu&s;covites, A&s;iaticks, &amp;c.</P>
<P>This mixture produces creatures more extraordinary than you can imagine: nor could I ever doubt, but there were &s;e|veral
<PB N="35" REF="011340_0037_0F86A083E47E3578">
different &s;pecies of men; &s;ince the whites, the woolly and the long hair'd blacks, the &s;mall-eyed Tartars and Chi|ne&s;e, the beardle&s;s Bra&s;ilians (and to name name no more) the oily-skinned yellow Nova Zemblians, have as &s;pecific differen|ces under the &s;ame general kind, as grey|hounds, ma&s;tiffs, &s;paniels, bull dogs, or the race of my little Diana, if nobody is of|fended at the compari&s;on. Now as the va|rious intermixing of the&s;e later animals cau&s;es mungrels, &s;o mankind have their mungrels too, divided and &s;ubdivided into endle&s;s &s;orts. We have daily proofs of it here, as I told you before. In the &s;ame animal is not &s;eldom remarked the Greek perfidiousne&s;s, and the Italian diffidence, the Spani&s;h arrogance and the French lo|quacity, and all of a &s;udden he is &s;eized with a fit of Engli&s;h thoughtfulne&s;s, border|ing a little upon dullne&s;s, which many of us have inherited from the &s;tupidity of our Saxon progenitors. But the family which charms me mo&s;t, is that which proceeds from the fanta&s;tical conjunction of a Dutch male with a Greek female. As the&s;e are natures oppo&s;ite in extremes, 'tis a plea|&s;ure to ob&s;erve how the differing attoms are perpetually jarring together in the chil|dren, even &s;o as to produce effects vi&s;i|ble in their external form. They have the large black eyes of the country, with the fat, white, fi&s;hy fle&s;h of Holland, and
<PB N="36" REF="011340_0038_0F86A08460453B00">
a lively air &s;treaked with dullne&s;s. At one and the &s;ame time, they &s;hew that love of expen&s;ivene&s;s, &s;o univer&s;al among the Greeks, and an inclination to the Dutch frugality. To give an example of this: young women ruin them&s;elves to purcha&s;e jewels for adorning their heads, while they have not the heart to buy new &s;hoes or rather &s;lippers for their feet, which are commonly in a tattered con|dition; a thing &s;o contrary to the ta&s;te of our Engli&s;h women that it is for &s;hew|ing how neatly their feet are dre&s;&s;ed, and for &s;hewing this only they are &s;o pa&s;&s;io|nately enamoured with their hoop-peti|coats. I have abundance of other &s;ingu|larities to communicate to you, but I am at the end both of my French and my paper.</P>

<P>Neverthele&s;s, prompted by that ardour which truth in&s;pires, I dare to maintain the contrary, and re&s;olutely in&s;i&s;t, that there are &s;ome marriages formed by love, which may be delightful, where the affection are &s;ympathetic.

<P>We may con&s;ider the gifts of fortune as &s;o many &s;teps nece&s;&s;ary to arrive at fe|licity, which we can never attain, being obliged to &s;et bounds to our de&s;ires, and being only gratified with &s;ome of her frivolous favours; which are nothing more than the torments of life, when they are con&s;idered as the nece&s;&s;ary means to acquire or pre&s;erve a more exqui&s;ite felicity.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="011340_0039_0F86A084C7C08AF8">
This felicity con&s;i&s;ts alone in friend&s;hip, founded on mutual e&s;teem, fixed by gra|titude, &s;upported by inclination, and ani|mated by the tender &s;olicitudes of Love, whom the ancients have admirably de&s;cribed under the appearance of a beautiful infant: it is plea&s;ed with infantine amu&s;ements, it is delicate and affectionate, incapable of mi&s;chief, delighted with trifles; its plea&s;ures are gentle and innocent.</P>
<P>They have given a very different repre|&s;entation of another pa&s;&s;ion too gro&s;s to be mentioned, but of which alone men in gene|ral are &s;u&s;ceptible. This they have de&s;cribed under the figure of a Satyr, who has more of the brute than of the man in his compo&s;i|tion. By this fabulous animal they have ex|pre&s;&s;ed a pa&s;&s;ion, which is the real founda|tion of all the fine exploits of modi&s;h gallan|try, and which only endeavours to glut its appetite with the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the object which is mo&s;t lovely in its e&s;timation: a pa&s;|&s;ion founded in inju&s;tice, &s;upported by deceit and atttended by crimes, remor&s;e, jealou&s;y and contempt. Can &s;uch an affection be delightful to a virtuous mind? Neverthele&s;s &s;uch is the delightful attendant on all illicit engagements; gallants are obliged to aban|don all tho&s;e &s;entiments of honour which are in&s;eparable from a liberal education, and are doomed to live wretchedly in the con|&s;tant pur&s;uit of what rea&s;on condemns to have all their plea&s;ures embittered by

remor&s;e, and to be reduced to the deplo|rable condition of having renounced virtue, without being able to make vice agreeable.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to ta&s;te the delights of love in perfection, but in a well a&s;&s;orted marriage; nothing betrays &s;uch a narrow|ne&s;s of mind as to be governed by words. What though cu&s;tom, for which good rea|&s;ons may be a&s;&s;igned, has made the words <HI>husband</HI> and <HI>wife</HI> &s;omewhat ridiculous? A husband in common acceptation, &s;ignifies a jealous brute, a &s;urly tyrant; or at be&s;t a weak fool, who may be made to believe any thing. A wife is a dome&s;tic terma|gant who is de&s;tined to deceive or torment the poor devil of a husband. The conduct of many married people too much reali|zes the&s;e two odious characters.</P>
<P>But as I &s;aid before, Why &s;hould words impo&s;e upon us? A well regulated marri|age is not like the&s;e connections of inter|e&s;t or ambition. A fond couple attached to each other by mutual affection, are two lovers who live happily together. Though the prie&s;t pronounces certain words, though the lawyer draws up cer|tain in&s;truments; yet I look on the&s;e preparatives in the &s;ame light as a lover con&s;iders a ladder of ropes which he fa&s;tens to his mi&s;tre&s;s's window: if they can but live together what does it &s;ignify at what price or by what means their union is accompli&s;hed? Where love is real and well

founded, it is impo&s;&s;ible to be happy but in the quiet enjoyment of the beloved object and the price at which it is ob|tained does not le&s;&s;en the vivacity and delights of a pa&s;&s;ion &s;uch as my ima|gination conceives.

Can they exchange more dear and affectionate pledges? Is it not natural, to give the mo&s;t inconte&s;table proofs of that tenderne&s;s with which our minds are impre&s;&s;ed? I am &s;en&s;ible that &s;ome are &s;o nice as to maintain that the plea&s;ures of love are derived from the dangers and difficulties with which it is attended; they very pertly ob&s;erve, that a ro&s;e would not appear a ro&s;e with|out thorns.

<P>Two married lovers lead very differ|ent lives; they have the plea&s;ures to pa&s;s their time in a &s;ucce&s;&s;ive intercour&s;e of mutual obligations, and marks of bene|volence, and they have the delight to find that each forms the entire happine&s;s of the beloved object. Herein con&s;i&s;ts per|fect felicity. The mo&s;t trivial concerns of oeconomy become noble and elegant when they are exalted by &s;entiments of affecti|on; to furni&s;h an appartment, is not barely to furni&s;h an apartment; it is a place where I expect my lover: to prepare a &s;upper, is not merely giving orders to my cook; it is an amu&s;ement to regale the object I doa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> on.

<P>A fixed and affectionate attachment &s;of|tens every emotion of the &s;oul, and ren|ders every object agreeable which pre&s;ents it&s;elf to the happy lover (I mean one who is married to his mi&s;tre&s;s.)

If fortune is

favourable to him, for &s;ucce&s;s does not depend on merit, all the advantages it procures are &s;o many tributes which he thinks due to the charms of the lovely fair; and in gratifying this ambition, he feels a more lively plea&s;ure, and more worthy of an hone&s;t man, than that of rai&s;ing his fortune, and gaining public applau&s;e. He enjoys glory, titles and rich|es no farther than as they regard her he loves; and when he attracts the approba|tion of a &s;enate the applau&s;e of an army, or the commendation of his prince, it is her prai&s;es which ultimately flatter him.</P>
<P>In a rever&s;e of fortune, he has the con|&s;olation of retiring to one who is affect|ed by his di&s;grace; and locked in her embraces he has the &s;atisfaction of giving utterance to the following tender reflec|tions. <Q>My happine&s;s does not depend on the caprice of fortune; I have a con|&s;tant a&s;&s;ylum again&s;t inquietude. Your e&s;teem renders me in&s;en&s;ible of the in|ju&s;tice of a court, or the ingratitude of a ma&s;ter and my lo&s;&s;es afford me a kind of plea&s;ure, &s;ince they furni&s;h me with fre&s;h proofs of your virtue and affecti|on. Of what u&s;e is grandeur to tho&s;e who are already happy?

<P><PB N="43" REF="011340_0041_0F86A086A8692378">
In &s;hort there is no &s;ituation in which melancholy may not be a&s;&s;uaged by the company of the beloved object. Sickne&s;s it&s;elf is not without its alleviation, when we have the plea&s;ure of being attended by her we love. I &s;hould never conclude, if I attempted to give a detail of all the delights of an attachment, wherein we meet with every thing which can flatter the &s;en&s;|es with the mo&s;t lively and diffu&s;ive rap|tures. But I mu&s;t not omit taking notice of the plea&s;ure of beholding the lovely pledges of a tender friend&s;hip, daily grow|ing up, and of amu&s;ing our&s;elves, accord|ing to our different &s;exes, in training them to perfection We give way to this agree|able in&s;tinct of nature, refined by love. In a daughter we prai&s;e the beauty of her mother: in a &s;on we commend the un|der&s;tanding, and the appearance of innate probity which we e&s;teem in his father. It is a plea&s;ure which according to Mo&s;es, the Almighty him&s;elf enjoyed, when he beheld the work of his hands, and &s;aw that all was good.</P>
<P>Speaking of Mo&s;es. I cannot forbear ob|&s;erving that the primitive plan of felicity infinitely &s;urpa&s;&s;es all others, and I can|not form an idea of Paradi&s;e, more like a Paradi&s;e than the &s;tate in which our fir&s;t parents were placed: that proved of &s;hort duration, becau&s;e they were unacquainted with the world, and it is for the &s;ame
<PB N="44" REF="011340_0042_0F86A0874F2FFC38">
rea&s;on that &s;o few love matches prove hap|py. Eve was like a &s;illy child, and Adam was not much enlightened. When &s;uch people come together, their being amo|rous is to no purpo&s;e, for their affections mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be &s;hort lived. In the tran&s;ports of their love they form &s;upper-natural ideas of each other. The man thinks his mi&s;tre&s;s an angel becau&s;e &s;he is hand|&s;ome, and &s;he is enraptured with the me|rit of her lover, becau&s;e he adores her. The fir&s;t decay of her complexion depri|ves her of his adoration, and the hu&s;b|and being no longer an adorer, becomes hateful to her, who had no other foun|dation for her love. By degrees they grow di&s;gu&s;tful to each other, and after the example of our fir&s;t parents they do not fail to reproach each other with the crime of their mutual imbecillity. After indiffer|ence contempt comes apace, and they are convinced that they mu&s;t hate each other, becau&s;e they are married. Their &s;malle&s;t de|fects &s;well in each other's view, and they grow blind to tho&s;e charms which, in any other object would plea&s;e them. A commerce founded merely on &s;en&s;ation can be attended with no other con&s;equences.</P>
<P>A man, when he marries the object of his affections, &s;hould forget that &s;he appears to him adorable, and &s;hould con&s;ider her merely as a mortal, &s;ubject to di&s;orders, caprice and ill temper; he &s;hould arm him&s;elf
<PB N="45" REF="011340_0042_0F86A0874F2FFC38">
with fortitude, to bear the lo&s;s of her beauty, and &s;hould provide him&s;elf with a fund of complai&s;ance which is requi&s;ite to &s;upport a con&s;tant intercour&s;e, with a per&s;on even of the highe&s;t under&s;tanding and the greate&s;t equanimity. The wife, on the other hand&punc; &s;hould, not expect a con|tinued cour&s;e of adulation and obedience; &s;he &s;hould di&s;po&s;e her&s;elf to obey in her turn with a good grace; a &s;cience very difficult to attain, and con&s;equently the more e&s;timable in the opinion of a man who is &s;en&s;ible of the merit. She &s;hould endeavour to revive the charms of the mi&s;|tre&s;s, by the &s;olidity and good &s;en&s;e of the friend.</P>
<P>When a pair, who entertain &s;uch rati|onal &s;entiments, are united by indi&s;&s;olu|ble bonds all nature &s;miles upon them, and the mo&s;t common objects appear de|lightful. In my oppinion, &s;uch a life is infinitely more happy and more volup|tuous, than the mo&s;t ravi&s;hing and be&s;t regulated gallantry.</P>
<P>A woman who is capable of reflection can con&s;ider a gallant in no other light than that of a &s;educer who would take ad|vantage of her weakne&s;s, to procure a mo|mentary plea&s;ure at the expence of her glory, her peace her honour, and perhaps her life. A highwayman who claps a pi&s;tol to your brea&s;t, to rob you of your pur&s;e, is le&s;s di&s;hone&s;t and le&s;s guilty; and I have
<PB N="46" REF="011340_0043_0F86A087C6293988">
&s;o good an opinion of my&s;elf as to believe that if I was a man, I &s;hould be as capable of a&s;&s;uming the character of an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, as that of &s;educing an hone&s;t woman, e&s;teem|ed in the world and happy in her hu&s;|band, by attempting to in&s;pire her with a pa&s;&s;ion to which &s;he mu&s;t &s;acrifice her honour, her tranquillity and her virtue.</P>
<P>Should I make her de&s;picable, who ap|pears amiable in my eyes? Should I reward her tenderne&s;s, by making her abhorred by her family, by rendering her children indifferent to her, and her husband dete&s;table? I believe that the&s;e re|flections would have appeared to me in as &s;trong a light, it my &s;ex had not ren|dered them excu&s;able in &s;uch ca&s;es; and I hope that I &s;hould have had more &s;en&s;e than to imagine vice the le&s;s vicious, be|cau&s;e it is the fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>N. B. I am much plea&s;ed with the Turki&s;h manners: a people, though igno|rant, yet, in my judgment, extremely po|lite. A gallant convicted of having de|bauched a married woman, is regarded as a pernicious being, and held in the &s;ame abhorrence as a pro&s;titute with us. He is certain of never making his fortune, and they would deem it &s;candalous to confer any con&s;iderable employment on a man &s;u&s;pected of having committed &s;uch enormous inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>What would the&s;e moral people think
<PB N="47" REF="011340_0043_0F86A087C6293988">
of our anti-knights-errant, who are ever in pur&s;uit of adventures to reduce inno|cent virgins to di&s;tre&s;s, and to rob vir|tuous women of their honour; who re|gard beauty, youth, rank, nay virtue it&s;elf as &s;o many incentives, which inflame their de&s;ires, and render their efforts more eager; and who, priding them&s;elves in the glory of appearing expert &s;educers, forget that with all their endeavours, they can only acquire the &s;econd rank in that ignoble order the Devil having long &s;ince been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>Our barbarous manners are &s;o well calculated for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of vice and wretchedne&s;s, which are ever in&s;eparable, that it requires a degree of under&s;tand|ing and &s;en&s;ibility infinitely above the common, to reli&s;h the felicity of a mar|riage &s;uch as I have de&s;cribed. Nature is &s;o weak and &s;o prone to change, that it is difficult to maintain the be&s;t grounded con&s;tancy, in the mid&s;t of tho&s;e di&s;&s;ipa|tions, which our ridiculous cu&s;toms have rendered unavoidable.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t pain an amorous husband to &s;ee his wife take all that fa&s;hionable liber|ties; it &s;eems har&s;h not to allow them and to be conformable he is reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of letting every one take them that will, to hear her impart the charms of her under&s;tanding to all the world, to &s;ee her di&s;play her bo&s;om at

Is it po&s;&s;i|ble to pre&s;erve an e&s;teem for &s;uch a crea|ture, or at lea&s;t mu&s;t not her value be greatly dimini&s;hed by &s;uch a commerce?</P>
<P>I mu&s;t &s;till re&s;ort to the maxims of the Ea&s;t, where the mo&s;t beautiful women are content to confine the power of their charms to him who has a right to en|joy them; and they are too &s;incere not to confe&s;s, that they think them&s;elves ca|pable of exciting de&s;ires.</P>
<P>I recollect a conver&s;ation that I had with a lady of great quality at Con&s;tan|tinople, (the mo&s;t amiable woman I ever knew in my life and with whom I after wards contracted the clo&s;e&s;t friend&s;hip.) She frankly acknowledged that &s;he was &s;atisfied with her husband. What libertines &s;aid &s;he you Chri&s;tian ladies are! You are permitted to receive vi&s;its from as many men as you think proper, and your laws allow you the unlimited u&s;e of love and wine. I a&s;&s;ured her that &s;he was wrong informed, and that it was criminal to li&s;|ten to, or to love, any other than our husbands. <Q>Your husbands are great fools &s;he replied &s;miling&punc; to be content with &s;o precarious a fidelity.

<HEAD>The CHARACTER of a LOVELY WOMAN.</HEAD>
<P>I DO not know a woman in the world who &s;eems &s;o much formed to render a man of &s;en&s;e and genero&s;ity more happy in the married &s;tate than Ama&s;ia.</P>
<P>Ama&s;ia never &s;aid, or attempted to &s;ay, a &s;prightly thing in all her life; but &s;he has done ten thou&s;and generous ones; and if &s;he is not the mo&s;t con&s;picu|ous figure at an a&s;&s;embly, &s;he never envied or ma|ligned tho&s;e who are, her heart is all tenderne&s;s and benevolence: no &s;ucce&s;s ever attended any of her acquaintance, which did not fill her bo&s;om with the mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted complacency; and no misfor|tune ever reached her knowledge, that &s;he did not relieve or participate by her genero&s;ity. If ever &s;he &s;hould fall into the arms of a man &s;he loves (and I am per&s;uaded &s;he would e&s;teem it the wor&s;t kind of pro&s;titution to re&s;ign her&s;elf into any other) her whole life would be one continued &s;eries of kindne&s;s and compliance.</P>
<P>The humble opinion &s;he has of her own uncom|mon merit, would make her &s;o much the more &s;en&s;i|ble of her hu&s;band's; and tho&s;e little &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions on his &s;ide, which a woman of more pride and &s;pi|rit would con&s;ider only as a claim of right, would be e&s;teemed by Ama&s;ia as &s;o many additional mo|tives to her love and gratitude.</P>

<HEAD>THE ADVENTURES OF TOM DREADNOUGHT, Who &s;erved as a SOLDIER, and al&s;o as a SAILOR, in the late WAR.</HEAD>
<P>NO ob&s;ervation is more common, and at the &s;ame time more true, than, That one half of the world are ignorant how the other half lives. The misfortunes of the great are held up to engage our attention; are enlarged upon in tones of declamation; and the world is called upon to gaze at the noble &s;ufferers: the great, under the pre&s;&s;ure of calamity, are con&s;cious of &s;everal others
<PB N="19" REF="011340_0058_0F86A09ADA6A44A0">
&s;ympathizing with their di&s;tre&s;s; and have, at once, the comfort of admiration and pity.</P>
<P>There is nothing magnanimous in bearing mis|fortunes with fortitude, when the whole world is looking on: men in &s;uch circum&s;tances will act bravely even from motives of vanity; but he who, in the vale of ob&s;curity, can brave adver&s;ity; who, without friends to encourage, acquaintances to pity, or even without hope to alleviate his misfortunes, can behave with tranquillity and indifference is truly great: whether pea&s;ant or courtier, he de&s;erves ad|miration, and &s;hould be held up for our imitation and re&s;pect.</P>
<P>While the &s;lighte&s;t inconveniencies of the great are magnified into calamities! while tragedy mouths out their &s;ufferings in all the &s;trains of eloquence, the mi&s;eries of the poor are entirely di&s;regarded; and yet &s;ome of the lower ranks of people undergo more real hard&s;hips in one day, than tho&s;e of a more exalted &s;tation &s;uffer in their whole lives. It is in|conceivable what difficulties the meane&s;t of our com|mon &s;ailors and &s;oldiers endure without murmuring or regret; without pa&s;&s;ionately declaiming again&s;t Providence, or calling their fellows to be gazers on their intrepidity. Every day is to them a day of mi&s;ery, and yet they entertain their hard fate with|out repining.</P>
<P>With what indignation do I hear an Ovid, a Cicero, or a Rabutin, complain of their misfortunes and hard&s;hips, who&s;e greate&s;t calamity was that of being unable to vi&s;it a certain &s;pot of earth, to which they had fooli&s;hly attached an Idea of happine&s;s. Their di&s;tre&s;&s;es were plea&s;ures, compared to what many of the adventuring poor every day endure without murmuring. They eat, drank, and &s;lept, they had &s;laves to attend them, and were &s;ure of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for life: while many of their fellow-crea|tures are obliged to wander without a friend to com|fort
<PB N="20" REF="011340_0059_0F86A09C0BA7A098">
or a&s;&s;i&s;t them, and even without &s;helter from the &s;everity of the &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>I have been led into the&s;e reflections from acci|dentally meeting, &s;ome days ago, a poor fellow, whom I knew when a boy, dre&s;&s;ed in a &s;ailor's jac|ket, and begging at one of the outlets of the town, with a wooden leg. I knew him to have been ho|ne&s;t and indu&s;trious when in the country, and was curious to learn what had reduced him to his pre&s;ent &s;ituation. Wherefore, after giving him what I thought proper, I de&s;ired to know the hi&s;tory of his life and misfortunes, and the manner in which he was reduc|ed to his pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s. The di&s;abled &s;oldier, for &s;uch he was, though dre&s;&s;ed in a &s;ailor's habit, &s;cratch|ing his head, and leaning on his crutch, put him&s;elf into an attitude to comply with my reque&s;t, and gave me his hi&s;tory, as follows.</P>
<Q><P>As for my misfortunes, ma&s;ter, I can't pretend to have gone through any more than other folks; for, except the lo&s;s of my limb, and my being obliged to beg, I don't know any rea&s;on thank Hea|ven, that I have to complain; there is Bill Tibbs, of our regiment, he has lo&s;t both his legs, and an eye to boot; but thank Heaven, it is not &s;o bad with me yet.</P>
<P>I was born in Shrop&s;hire, my father was a la|bourer, and died when I was five years old, &s;o I was put upon the pari&s;h. As he had been a wandering &s;ort of a man, the pari&s;hioners were not able to tell to what pari&s;h I belonged, or where I was born, &s;o they &s;ent me to another pari&s;h, and that pari&s;h &s;ent me to a third. I thought in my heart, they kept &s;ending me about &s;o long, that they would not let me be born in any pari&s;h at all; but, at la&s;t however, they fixed me. I had &s;ome di&s;po&s;ition to be a &s;cholar, and was re&s;olved, at lea&s;t, to know my letters; but the ma&s;ter of the work|hou&s;e put me to bu&s;ine&s;s as &s;oon as I was able to
<PB N="21" REF="011340_0059_0F86A09C0BA7A098">
handle a mallet; and here I lived an ea&s;y kind of life for five years. I only wrought ten hours in the day, and had my meat and drink provided for my labour. It is true I was not &s;uffered to &s;tir out of the hou&s;e, for fear, as they &s;aid, I &s;hould run away; but what of that, I had the liberty of the whole hou&s;e, and the yard before the door, and that was enough for me. I was then bound out to a farmer, where I was up both early and late; but I eat and drank well, and liked my bu&s;ine&s;s well enough, till he died, when I was obliged to provide for my&s;elf, &s;o I was re&s;olved to go &s;eek my fortune.</P>
<P>In this manner I went from town to town, worked when I could get employment, and &s;tarved when I could get none: when happening one day to go through a field belonging to a ju&s;tice of peace, I &s;pyed a hare cro&s;&s;ing the path ju&s;t before me; and I believe the devil put it in my head to fling my &s;tick at it:&mdash;Well what will you have on't? I killed the hare, and was bringing it away, when the ju&s;tice him&s;elf met me, he called me a poacher and villain; and collaring me, de|&s;ired I would give an account of my&s;elf: I fell upon my knees, begged his wor&s;hip's pardon, and began to give a full account of all that I knew of my breed, &s;eed and generation; but, though I gave a very true account, the ju&s;tice &s;aid I could give no account at all; &s;o I was indicted at &s;e&s;&s;ions, found guilty of being poor, and &s;ent up to London to Newgate, in order to be tran&s;ported as a vagabond.</P>
<P>People may &s;ay this and that of being in jail; but, for my part, I found Newgate as agreeable a place as ever I was in, in all my life. I had my belly full to eat and drink, and did no work at all. This kind of life was too good to la&s;t for ever; &s;o I was taken out of pri&s;on, after five months, put on board a &s;hip and &s;ent off with two hundred more
<PB N="22" REF="011340_0060_0F86A09CB642B770">
to the plantations. We had but an indifferent pa&s;&s;age, for, being all confined in the hold, more than a hundred of our people died for want of &s;weet air; and tho&s;e that remained were &s;ickly enough God knows. When we came a-&s;hore we were &s;old to the planters, and I was bound for &s;even years more. As I was no &s;cholar, for I did not know my letters, I was obliged to work among the negroes; and I &s;erved out my time, as in duty bound to do.</P>
<P>When my time was expired, I worked my pa&s;|&s;age home, and glad I was to &s;ee Old England again, becau&s;e I loved my country. I was afraid, however, that I &s;hould be indicted for a vagabond once more, &s;o I did not much care to go down into the country, but kept about the town, and did little jobs when I could get them.</P>
<P>I was very happy in this manner for &s;ome time, till one evening, coming home from work, two men knocked me down, and then bid me &s;tand. They belonged to a pre&s;s gang: I was carried be|fore the ju&s;tice, and, as I could give no account of my&s;elf, I had my choice left whether to go on board a man of war, or li&s;t for a &s;oldier. I cho&s;e the latter; and in this po&s;t of a gentleman, I &s;erv|ed two campaigns in Flanders, was at the bat|tles of Val and Fontenoy, and received but one wound, through the brea&s;t here; but the doctor of our regiment &s;oon made me well again.</P>
<P>When the peace came on I was di&s;charged; and as I could not work, becau&s;e my wound was &s;ome|times trouble&s;ome, I li&s;ted for a landman in the Ea&s;t-India company's &s;ervice. I here fought the French in &s;ix pitched battles; and I verily believe, that, if I could read or write, our captain would have made me a corporal; but it was not my good fortune to have any promotion, for I &s;oon fell &s;ick and &s;o got leave to return home again, with forty pounds in my pocket. This was at the beginning
<PB N="23" REF="011340_0060_0F86A09CB642B770">
of the pre&s;ent war, and I hoped to be &s;et on &s;hore, and to have the plea&s;ure of &s;pending my money; but the government wanted men, and &s;o I was pre&s;&s;ed for a &s;ailor, before ever I could &s;et my foot on &s;hore.</P>
<P>The boat&s;wain found me, as he &s;aid, an ob&s;ti|nate fellow; he &s;wore he knew that I under&s;tood my bu&s;ine&s;s well, but that I <HI>&s;hammed Abraham,</HI> to be idle; but God knows, I knew nothing of the &s;ea-bu&s;ine&s;s, and he beat me without con&s;i|dering what he was about. However I had &s;till my forty pounds, and that was &s;ome comfort to me under every beating; and the money I might have had to this day, but that our &s;hip was taken by the French, and &s;o I lo&s;t all.</P>
<P>Our crew was carried into Bre&s;t, and many of them died, becau&s;e they were not u&s;ed to live in a jail; but for my part, it was nothing to me, for I was &s;ea&s;oned. One night as I was &s;leeping on the bed of boards, with a warm blanket about me, for I always loved to lie well, I was awakened by the boat&s;wain who had a dark lanthorn in his hand; Tom, &s;ays he to me will you knock out the French centry's brains? I don't care, &s;ays I, &s;triv|ing to keep my&s;elf awake, if I lend a hand. Then follow me, &s;ays he, and I hope we &s;hall do bu&s;i|ne&s;s. So up I got, and tied my blanket, which was all the cloaths I had, about my middle, and went with him to fight the Frenchmen. I hate the French becau&s;e they are all &s;laves, and wear wooden &s;hoes.</P>
<P>Though we had no arms, one Engli&s;hman is able to beat five French at any time; &s;o we went down to the door, where both the centries were po&s;ted, and ru&s;hing upon them, &s;eized their arms in a moment, and knocked them down. From thence nine of us ran together to the quay, and &s;eizing the fir&s;t boat we met, got out of the har|bour
<PB N="24" REF="011340_0061_0F86A09DDC8D7E78">
and put to &s;ea. We had not been here three days before we were taken up by the Dor&s;et priva|teer who were glad of &s;o many good hands; and we con&s;ented to run our chance. However we had not as much luck as we expected. In three days we fell in with the Pompadour privateer, of forty guns, while we had but twenty-three; &s;o to it we went yard-arm and yard-arm. The fight la&s;ted for three hours, and I verily believe we &s;hould have taken the Frenchman, had we but had &s;ome more men left behind: but unfortunately, we lo&s;t all our men ju&s;t as we were going to get the victory.</P>
<P>I was once more in the power of the French, and I believe it would have gone hard with me had I been brought back to Bre&s;t: but by good fortune, we were retaken by the Viper. I had almo&s;t forgot to tell you, that in that engagement, I was wound|ed in two places: I lo&s;t four fingers of the left hand, and my leg was &s;hot off. If I had had the good fortune to have lo&s;t my leg and the u&s;e of my hand on board a kings &s;hip and not a-board a pri|vateer, I &s;hould have been entitled to cloathing and maintainance during the re&s;t of my life: but that was not my chance: one man is born with a &s;ilver &s;poon in his mouth, and another with a wooden ladle. However, ble&s;&s;ed be God, I enjoy good health, and will forever love liberty and Old England. Liberty property and Old England, for ever, huzza!</P></Q>
<P>Thus &s;aying, TOM limped off, leaving me in admiration at his intrepidity and content: but I could not avoid acknowledging, that an habitual acquaintance with mi&s;ery &s;erves better than philo&s;o|phy to teach us to de&s;pi&s;e it.</P>
