<P>TO commemorate the <HI>Nineteenth of April,</HI> 1775, when this di&s;tre&s;&s;ing war began&mdash;To &s;ympathize with the friends of tho&s;e who fell the fir&s;t victims to <HI>Briti&s;h tyranny</HI> in this place &mdash;To acknowledge the <HI>help of the Lord,</HI> which we have experienced in the cour&s;e of the di&s;pute&mdash; And, to encourage our tru&s;t in God to perfect what is lacking, are, no doubt, among the de&s;igns of this <HI>Anniver&s;ary</HI>: Which are ju&s;tified and re|commended by antient u&s;ages, and the expre&s;s command of God to pa&s;t ages upon &s;imilar occa|&s;ions. For, if we look back upon the annals of time, and critically ob&s;erve the conduct of divine providence in the various ages of the world, we &s;hall find God has not le&s;t him&s;elf without wit|ne&s;s,
<PB N="6" REF="016685_0004_0F9D77D5627AB4B8">
but has been doing good, filling the hearts of men with gladne&s;s. And both before and un|der the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> di&s;pen&s;ation, as well as in go&s;pel times, when God de&s;igned to perpetuate the re|membrance of any peculiar <HI>period</HI> of time&mdash;re|markable <HI>event</HI> in providence, or extraordinary <HI>&s;alvation</HI> wrought for his people,&mdash;He erected, or ordered monuments to be erected, as &s;tanding witne&s;&s;es or monitors to mankind of their obliga|tion therefor.&mdash;Thus, the <HI>&s;eventh day &s;abbath,</HI> was in&s;tituted by God as a day of <HI>re&s;t</HI> in perpetu|al remembrance of the creation of the world, as the <HI>chri&s;tian-&s;abbath,</HI> was &s;ince in remembrance of Chri&s;t's <HI>glorious re&s;urrection</HI> from the dead.</P>
<P>THUS it is the declared de&s;ign of the holy <HI>&s;up|per</HI> to keep alive the <HI>de&s;ign</HI> and <HI>agonies</HI> of his death, who was &s;acrificed for us&mdash;as a witne&s;s and monument of that great &s;alvation which the whole world have rea&s;on to rejoice in. The <HI>pa&s;&s;over</HI> was in&s;tituted and ob&s;erved, as a <HI>&s;tanding memorial</HI> of the departure of the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> out of <HI>Egypt. Penteco&s;t,</HI> to admoni&s;h of the reality and time of the law's being given on <HI>Sinai.</HI> The <HI>fea&s;t of Tabernacles,</HI> as a memorial that the I&s;rael|ites dwelt in tents in the wilderne&s;s. Thus, the <HI>Stone</HI> at <HI>Bethel</HI> was &s;et up, as a <HI>continual memorial</HI> of that extraordinary revelation to <HI>Jacob</HI> in his way to <HI>Padan-Aram.</HI> Thus again, the monu|ment or heap of &s;tones called <HI>Gilead</HI> was a wit|ne&s;s of the covenant between <HI>Laban</HI> and <HI>Jacob.</HI> And thus you remember, that the <HI>heap of &s;tones</HI> in the mid&s;t of <HI>Jordan,</HI> and the <HI>pile</HI> erected in
<PB N="7" REF="016685_0005_0F9D77D62403A290">
<HI>Gilgal,</HI> were &s;tanding memorials, to the pre&s;ent and &s;ucceeding generations, of the wonderful <HI>&s;al|vation</HI> wrought for the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> in carrying them thro' tho&s;e waters, <HI>dry &s;hod.</HI> And, of the like nature and de&s;ign was the <HI>&s;tone</HI> which <HI>Samuel</HI> &s;et up by the name of <HI>Ebenezer</HI> to keep alive the re|membrance of a <HI>great &s;alvation,</HI> wrought for them in their &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t the <HI>Phili&s;tines.</HI> And this &s;alvation will appear more worthy of remem|brance, if we con&s;ider &s;ome peculiar circum&s;tan|ces by which it was preceeded. The <HI>Phili&s;tines,</HI> who came early into <HI>Pale&s;tine</HI> were a powerful people, even in <HI>Abraham</HI>'s time: And, notwith|&s;tanding all the conque&s;ts of <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> they greatly oppre&s;&s;ed I&s;rael &s;ince, under the <HI>Judges,</HI> under <HI>Saul,</HI> and in the beginning of <HI>David</HI>'s reign. In particular we have mention made (in 4<HI>th Chap.</HI> of this Book) of two battles fought between <HI>I&s;rael</HI> and the <HI>Phili&s;tines</HI>; in the fir&s;t of which, <HI>I&s;rael</HI> lo&s;t the battle and had four thou&s;and men &s;lain; upon which they conclude, and that ju&s;t|ly, that the pre&s;ence of the Lord was not with them: They, therefore, &s;end for the <HI>Ark</HI> of God, tru&s;ting in the token of his pre&s;ence, rather than in the power of his arm; hence they lo&s;e a &s;e|cond battle when <HI>thirty thou&s;and fell,</HI> and the <HI>Ark</HI> of God, in which they tru&s;ted, was taken from them: Which &s;hews that the external tokens of God's pre&s;ence afford no &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>AFTER this, we find by our context, that <HI>I&s;rael</HI> were bro't to an humble dependance on the &s;trength of the Lord; and therefore, intreat that
<PB N="8" REF="016685_0006_0F9D77D6E1C29400">
<HI>Samuel</HI> would not cea&s;e to pray for them. Ac|cordingly <HI>Samuel</HI> cried unto the Lord, and he heard him, and the Lord thundered with a great thunder that day upon the Phili&s;tines, and di&s;|comfitted them: And the men of I&s;rael went out of Mi&s;peh and pur&s;ued them and &s;mote them until they came to Bethear.</P>
<P>Now this was &s;o affecting to Samuel, and was &s;o de&s;erving remembrance, that he erected a monu|ment, a &s;tone of Remembrance, and called it <HI>Ebenezer</HI> &s;aying <HI>hitherto hath the Lord helped us. Samuel</HI>&punc; who had prayed for the mercy, now upon the receipt of it, &s;ets up his <HI>Ebenezer</HI> as a memorial, that the &s;alvation might be kept in everla&s;ting remembrance.&mdash;&mdash;We have only then to con&s;ider</P>
<P>THE valuable purpo&s;es &s;uch monuments &s;erve &mdash; and</P>
<P>THE frequent occa&s;ion a merciful God has given his people to &s;et them up &mdash; before we proceed to tho&s;e addre&s;&s;es which may fini&s;h the di&s;cour&s;e:</P>
<P>FIRST then, as to the valuable purpo&s;es &s;uch monuments and &s;uch acknowledgments may &s;erve&mdash;I would ob&s;erve with reference to that of <HI>Samuel.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. THAT it was a perpetual remembrance of the <HI>di&s;tre&s;s</HI> I&s;rael was in on that day.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="016685_0007_0F9D77D81A982AA0">SALVATION is a relative term, and it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to &s;eperate the idea of a people's or per|&s;on's deliverance, from that of the mi&s;ery or dan|ger they were delivered from. "As the means of &s;afety &s;ometimes awaken the idea of danger," &s;o a memorial of a &s;alvation is, at the &s;ame time, a memorial of the di&s;tre&s;s. Hence the monument that <HI>Samuel</HI> erected, pointed to that day of di&s;tre&s;s when the <HI>Phili&s;tines</HI> were coming again&s;t <HI>I&s;rael</HI> again: Di&s;tre&s;s and confu&s;ion greatly heighten'd by their former di&s;tre&s;&s;es when <HI>I&s;rael</HI> fled before the <HI>Phili&s;tines,</HI> and were &s;lain by hundreds and thou&s;ands; which had left &s;uch an horror upon their minds, as was ea&s;ily rou&s;ed upon &s;uch an appearance. Now then, when the Children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> heard at <HI>Mi&s;peh,</HI> that the <HI>Phili&s;tines</HI> were coming again upon them, they were afraid&mdash;they were &s;urprized and plunged in the utmo&s;t per|plexity with their &s;udden and unexpected on&s;et; as this people have been upon a like occa&s;ion &mdash; The <HI>Phili&s;tines</HI> attacked them in an inglorious and cowardly manner; when unarmed and in no po&s;ture of defence; yea, when met together for repentance and prayer; as though they would mock their religion and their God both. And altho' the <HI>Phili&s;tines</HI> &s;oon pay dear for their pre|&s;umption, yet the remembrance of <HI>I&s;rael</HI>'s di&s;tre&s;s on that day was never to be blotted out.</P>
<P N="2">2. THIS monument and confe&s;&s;ion might teach humility and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion under di&s;appoint|ments. No words can be faller of humility and re&s;ignation than tho&s;e that <HI>Samuel</HI> uttered upon
<PB N="10" REF="016685_0008_0F9D77D8624E8820">
the occa&s;ion&mdash;"hitherto hath the Lord helped us;" a&s;cribing all to God&mdash;not murmuring that he did not help before, when they were di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and overcome; for he knew that God had not puni&s;hed them according to their de&s;erts, nor rewarded them according to their &s;ins: No, but notwith&s;tanding our former rebukes and di&s;|appointments which we &s;uffered for our &s;in and idolatry; yet let us a&s;cribe the &s;alvation of this day to God who has remembered mercy for us in the mid&s;t of judgment. As tho' he had &s;aid, "it is of the Lord's mercy we are not con&s;umed"&mdash; the Lord has not poured out the full vials of his indignation, but has made the wrath of man that is gone forth to prai&s;e him, and the remainder thereof he has re&s;trained. Not unto us, not unto us, but to thy name be the glory of this &s;alvation. For, we acknowledge in all that is bro't upon us, thou ha&s;t puni&s;hed us le&s;s than our iniquities have de&s;erved.</P>
<P N="3">3. THIS monument was a mark and evi|dence of God's owning and ble&s;&s;ing a particular tru&s;t in him.</P>
<P>After <HI>I&s;rael</HI> had lo&s;t the la&s;t battle mentioned before this, in which God &s;o remarkably appear|ed for them; they were di&s;po&s;ed univer&s;ally to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">, to put away their &s;trange gods, and to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> unto the Lord. Upon which <HI>Samuel</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> them &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t their enemies. And <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> they put away <HI>Baalim</HI> and <HI>A&s;teroth</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the Lord only. And as men per&s;uaded
<PB N="11" REF="016685_0009_0F9D77D923F19D48">
that their help was not in fal&s;e gods or in an arm of fle&s;h but only in the Lord of Ho&s;ts; and per&s;uaded that <HI>Samuel</HI> was a powerful and prevalent interce&s;&s;or, like Jacob who had power with God and prevailed: They &s;ay to him, "cea&s;e not to cry unto the Lord our God for us that he will &s;ave us out of the hands of the <HI>Phili&s;tines."</HI> They were very &s;olicitous that <HI>Samuel</HI> &s;hould not cea&s;e to pray for them.</P>
<P>WHAT military preparations were needful to be made, they would undertake them&s;elves, but let <HI>Samuel</HI> continue, in&s;tant in prayer: Perhaps remembring that when <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> did but let down his hand, ever &s;o little, <HI>Amalek</HI> prevailed.</P>
<P>THIS particular prayerful tru&s;t in the Lord, God accepted and ble&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>ISRAEL could never be threatned more &s;ea|&s;onably, &s;aith one, than at this time, when they were repenting and praying. Nor, could the <HI>Phili&s;tines</HI> have acted more impolitickly for them|&s;elves, than to make war upon <HI>I&s;rael</HI> at the very time, when <HI>I&s;rael</HI> were making their peace with God.</P>
<P>BUT God permitted them to do it, that he might have opportunity, immediately, of crown|ing his people's reformation with tokens of his favour. And of confirming the words of his <HI>Me&s;&s;enger,</HI> who had a&s;&s;ured them that if they repented, God would deliver them out of the hand of the <HI>Phili&s;tines.</HI></P>
<P N="4"><PB N="12" REF="016685_0010_0F9D77D9E20B7828">4. THIS monument was a con&s;tant memorial to them and their po&s;terity, of the <HI>obligations</HI> they were under to God for the <HI>&s;alvation</HI> of that Day.</P>
<P>THROUGH the imperfection of our memories; the ingratitude of our hearts; and the diver&s;ions of a vain world; we are apt to have the&s;e deep impre&s;&s;ions worn off, which are &s;ometimes made upon our minds, by the extraordinary providences of God, and remarkable deliverances of his peo|ple from earthquakes or from enemies; either when he has made us to &s;tand &s;till and &s;ee his &s;alvation, or, when he has &s;trengthened us, and remarkably led us on to conque&s;t.</P>
<P>And, <HI>Samuel</HI> &s;en&s;ible of this, altho' he had no rea&s;on to doubt but <HI>I&s;rael</HI> were properly affected for the pre&s;ent, yet tho't proper to erect a mo|nument that &s;hould be a con&s;tant and perpetual monitor to <HI>I&s;rael</HI> and their po&s;terity, that upon &s;uch a day the Lord wrought great deliverance for them, which inferred an obligation of grati|tude and obedience on them and their po&s;terity; like what <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> &s;aid to the <HI>Repre&s;entatives</HI> of the twelve <HI>tribes,</HI>&mdash;"pa&s;s over before the ark of the Lord your God into the mid&s;t of Jordan, and take ye up every man of you a &s;tone upon his &s;houlder, according unto the number of the tribes of the children of I&s;rael: That this may be a &s;ign among you that when your children a&s;k their fathers in time to come, &s;aying, What mean ye by the&s;e &s;tones? Then ye &s;hall an&s;wer them, that the waters of Jordan were cut off be|fore
<PB N="13" REF="016685_0011_0F9D77DAA2879980">
the ark of the covenant of the Lord, when it pa&s;&s;ed over Jordan, the waters of Jordan were cut off; and the&s;e &s;tones &s;hall be a memorial un|to the children of I&s;rael forever." But a memo|rial of what? Not &s;imply that &s;uch a thing was done, but that they were bound to acknowledge the marvellous <HI>loving kindne&s;s</HI> and a&s;toni&s;hing <HI>in|terpo&s;ition</HI> of God therein. As often as they &s;aw this monument they were reminded of God's goodne&s;s in their &s;alvation; and it was a con&s;tant demand of their dutiful and thankful obedience.</P>
<P N="5">5. SUCH a monument &s;erved to admoni&s;h them of the nece&s;&s;ity of relying on the Lord in every exigence for the future.</P>
<P>THEY had been taught, by &s;orrowful experi|ence, that the "race was not to the &s;wift, nor the battle to the &s;trong," yea that &s;ucce&s;s did not al|ways attend the name and profe&s;&s;ion of religion, or the external tokens of God's pre&s;ence, but a real, penitent tru&s;t in him. And Samuel, at lea&s;t was &s;en&s;ible that one &s;alvation did not en&s;ure ano|ther, nor was even an earne&s;t of it, without the like tru&s;t in God. The &s;in that procured their defeat formerly being pardoned upon their re|pentance, the pardon was &s;ealed upon this glori|ous victory, in the very &s;ame place, where they had before &s;uffered lo&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Samuel</HI> &s;aith, "hitherto hath the Lord helped us," which, at the &s;ame time that it expre&s;&s;es his thankfulne&s;s for what they had now received,
<PB N="14" REF="016685_0012_0F9D77DB6419E5C8">
expre&s;&s;es a doubt for the future. Hitherto, things have done well, but what God may yet do with us, we know not. This doubt, however, mu&s;t ari&s;e from the ficklene&s;s, or incon&s;tancy of the people, and from a fear that they would not con|tinue their obedience and dependence on provi|dence. For, none could be more confident than <HI>Samuel</HI> was that this would a&s;&s;ure them &s;ucce&s;s;&mdash; when he &s;aid, before this &s;alvation, "if ye do re|turn unto the Lord with all your hearts&mdash;and prepare your hearts unto the Lord and &s;erve him only, he will deliver you out of the hands of the Phili&s;tines." So that this monument and in&s;crip|tion, taught the nece&s;&s;ity of a tru&s;t in God, in all future time, in every day of need.</P>
<P>IF, the&s;e now, and &s;uch like are the valuable ends &s;uch monuments and &s;uch in&s;criptions &s;erve:&mdash;how &s;uitable mu&s;t it be, in the next place, to con&s;ider,</P>
<P>SECONDLY. How frequently God in his kind providence gives his people occa&s;ion to erect them.</P>
<P>AND indeed while we are looking on the various <HI>help of the Lord</HI> in time pa&s;t; what &s;hall we con|&s;ider it with reference to? And to what period of time &s;hall we look back? Shall we con&s;ider it with reference only to the pre&s;ent day of uncom|mon di&s;tre&s;s? Or, from the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of the country? Or, from the earlie&s;t accounts of time? And more e&s;pecially with reference to the church of God? For, verily God has wonderfully ap|peared
<PB N="15" REF="016685_0013_0F9D77DC21FF6E20">
for his people,&mdash;for their deliverance and help ever &s;ince he had a church in the world.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH, he has &s;uffered enemies to ri&s;e up and di&s;tre&s;s, yet not to de&s;troy it. The burn|ing bu&s;h has not been con&s;umed!</P>
<P>AND with regard to the chri&s;tian church, he has founded it upon a rock, and promi&s;ed that the gates of hell &s;hall not prevail again&s;t it. And that promi&s;e &s;hall &s;tand in &s;pite of all the powers of earth and the invi&s;ible world. Every generation &s;ince, has had rea&s;on to prai&s;e God for his goodne&s;s herein, and every generation &s;hall have rea&s;on to do it, as long as the &s;un and moon &s;hall endure.</P>
<P>BUT then, how con&s;picuous and wonderful has been <HI>the help of the Lord,</HI> in and &s;ince the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of this country.</P>
<P>LET us look back and con&s;ider what a dreary wilderne&s;s this was, little more than a century and half ago; and realize what could induce our forefathers to exchange a rich, fruitful and long cultivated &s;oil in their native land; for this, then, barren and howling wilderne&s;s; but the hope of exchanging, at the &s;ame time, tyranny and op|pre&s;&s;ion, for liberty and religion&mdash;the rights of men and liberty of con&s;cience.</P>
<P>AND how vi&s;ible was the help of the Lord, in perfecting their plan and bringing it to effect &mdash;
<PB N="16" REF="016685_0014_0F9D77DCE26A0730">
that when they had e&s;caped the dangers of the &s;ea, being few in number and &s;trangers in the land, that the native <HI>Savages</HI> did not &s;wallow them up quick.</P>
<P>BUT that God, who could pre&s;erve <HI>Daniel</HI> from the mercile&s;s jaws of hungry lions, pre&s;erved the&s;e exiles from the power of this blood-thir&s;ty people!</P>
<P>WE got not the land by our own &s;word, nei|ther did our own arm &s;ave us, but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, becau&s;e thou had&s;t a favour unto us.</P>
<P>GOD has driven out the heathen by little and little, and made room for this vine which is of his own right-hand's planting.</P>
<P>AND, how often have we experienced the help of the Lord in the wars we have been engaged in with the <HI>natives</HI> and their <HI>French neighbours</HI>? What &s;alvations have been wrought for us when in danger?</P>
<P>WHAT deliverances in time of fear? How has God pre&s;erved <HI>Americans</HI> from the &s;word, fa|mine and pe&s;tilence; and cau&s;ed them greatly to increa&s;e; &s;o that they are become comparatively a great people.</P>
<P>AND in the cour&s;e of the la&s;t war, the &s;eat of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> was in America, after &s;ome great di&s;ap|appointments,
<PB N="17" REF="016685_0015_0F9D77DDA42DB800">
heavy lo&s;&s;es and &s;pecial di&s;courage|ments; when it was manife&s;t we greatly needed the help of the Lord: How did God, as it were, turn again our captivity; or, rather turn our mourning into joy? And by what a &s;eries of &s;ucce&s;&s;es did the Lord deliver his people? And by what conque&s;ts over our enemies? When he gave them as du&s;t to our &s;word and us driven &s;tubble to our bow; cau&s;ed them to lick the du&s;t&mdash;and us to &s;et our feet upon their necks. Yea we were led from one &s;ucce&s;s and victory to another, by the powerful hand of the Lord of Ho&s;ts, un|til our conque&s;t was finally &s;o compleat; that, as it was tho't <HI>Engli&s;h America</HI> would be, for|ever, delivered from troubles of that &s;ort, which &s;he had been harra&s;&s;ed with, from her fir&s;t &s;ettle|ment: That the bitterne&s;s of war was over in this land; that the &s;nare was broken, and that we had, finally e&s;caped.</P>
<P>BUT, "the Lord &s;eeth not as man &s;eeth." What was in the womb of providence, and what deter|minations in the right hand of the mo&s;t high God, re&s;pecting us, we know not.</P>
<P>HOW mi&s;taken have we been!&mdash;As David when he got rid of <HI>Saul</HI> and his family, had tho&s;e of his own hou&s;e ri&s;e up again&s;t him, who bro't him into new, and greater troubles, than he had before: So it has been with us, tho&s;e of our own hou&s;e, as it were, have ri&s;en up again&s;t us.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="016685_0016_0F9D77DE61DC9FF8">OUR troubles now come from what we were <HI>once</HI> fond to call our parent &s;tate; who have a&s;&s;umed and exerci&s;ed an uncon&s;titutional, illegal, and unrea&s;onable authority over us: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">vid.

<P>BUT however in the mid&s;t of all the de&s;igns of our enemies to di&s;tre&s;s and en&s;lave us, the help of the Lord has been very con&s;picuous; and that in innumerable in&s;tances.</P>
<P>A FEW of tho&s;e that are mo&s;t obvious I &s;hall mention. And it is ob&s;ervable, that, however &s;ecret and &s;kulking the attack of our enemies was at la&s;t; yet it was happy that the fears of people had got previou&s;ly alarmed; and the galling yoke of tyranny began to be &s;o &s;everely felt, that, every denomination tho't it would &s;oon be intol|lerable, and hence, were forced into a re&s;olution, to &s;pend time and money, with their utmo&s;t en|deavours, for the &s;ervice and in defence of the rights and privileges of their country.</P>
<P>AND indeed what had become of us on the 19<HI>th of April,</HI> 1775. When men were called,
<PB N="19" REF="016685_0017_0F9D77DF9A8D87F8">
&s;o &s;uddenly, to buckle on their armour; if they had not proved it before; and if their had not been &s;ome previous care taken by the colonies to get equipt, and into an acquaintance with the u&s;e of arms and military exerci&s;es.&mdash;But as God prepared the way for <HI>I&s;rael</HI> into Canaan&mdash; and for our forefathers into this land;&mdash;So did he for that critical day, by in&s;piring people with a military &s;pirit&mdash;diffu&s;ing it thro' the province and land, in a greater degree than was ever known before; di&s;po&s;ing people of all ages and deno|minations (except &s;uch as have been in oppo&s;ition to all our mea&s;ures) to prepare them&s;elves for the time, when the cloud (of war) &s;hould break upon them.</P>
<P>AND the <HI>help of the Lord</HI> was &s;een, afterward, in that, altho' our enemies meant it for evil (as it was an evil indeed to individuals) yet the Lord meant it for good; and made the horrid murders of that day, an occa&s;ion of uniting the Colonies, beyond the expectation of the mo&s;t confident whig. From that day, a determination was for|med, to &s;tand by each other in oppo&s;ing tyranny and &s;lavery then breaking in upon us like a &s;tood.</P>
<P>MOREOVER, <HI>the help of the Lord</HI> was con|&s;picuous, in the pity and benevolence of our &s;i&s;ter States to this Province, when bro't under unheard of oppre&s;&s;ions; when they were di&s;po&s;ed to &s;end in to us, all the aid they could, in that time of di&s;tre&s;s, not only by information and coun&s;el,
<PB N="20" REF="016685_0018_0F9D77DFE202D920">
but in mo&s;t liberal donations of money and pro|vi&s;ion, for tho&s;e <HI>thou&s;ands</HI> that by the cruelty of the <HI>Port Bill</HI> were cut off, from the u&s;ual means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>THE <HI>help of the Lord</HI> was con&s;picuous like|wi&s;e, in that, when the exigency of our affairs, as was tho't, called for a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of courts of ju&s;tice, and &s;o of the operation and execution of laws, when every man's life and property became expo&s;ed to the lawle&s;s and violent; that there were &s;uch remarkable re&s;traints on the lu&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions of men; as that it was tho't, by the can|did and ob&s;erving, there were, at that time, fewer overt-acts and outrages puni&s;hable by law, than u&s;ual.</P>
<P>ANOTHER in&s;tance of <HI>the help of the Lord,</HI> worthy of notice is, that &s;o many of that &s;mall part of the community that were differently mind|ed in political things from the body of the peo|ple; and who from principle, intere&s;t or prejudice, acted in oppo&s;ition to the common cau&s;e, fled from the mid&s;t of us in the beginning of our troubles.</P>
<P>WHETHER the particular de&s;ign of their flee|ing to the metropolis, was per&s;onal &s;afety, as they pretended; or, for di&s;tinction and applau&s;e on the other &s;ide the water as others &s;uppo&s;ed: Yet we are convinced, from the conduct of tho&s;e that were left behind, that the removal of them
<PB N="21" REF="016685_0019_0F9D77E0A2202138">
that went, has contributed much to our &s;afety. And we never have had &s;o much rea&s;on to wi&s;h them back again, as to wi&s;h others, of the &s;ame dangerous principles, with them. De&s;igning men, among our&s;elves, mu&s;t be more dangerous to the community, than when joined with an open enemy.</P>
<P>MORROVER, How plain was <HI>the help of the Lord,</HI> that the di&s;&s;olution of our General A&s;|&s;embly&mdash;the legi&s;lator of the Province, was, in &s;o great a mea&s;ure, remedied by a voluntary pro|vincial Congre&s;s, who tran&s;acted matters, with as much prudence, and to as good purpo&s;e, as po&s;&s;i|ble, under, our then, broken circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>FURTHERMORE, How evident has been <HI>the help of the Lord,</HI> in forming and a&s;&s;embling the <HI>Continental Congre&s;s,</HI>&mdash;the Grand Council of the&s;e United States, in oppo&s;ition to the united wi&s;hes and joint endeavours of our enemies on the other &s;ide the Atlantic, and of their emi&s;&s;a|ries here.</P>
<P>AND indeed, <HI>the help of the Lord</HI> is not more to be taken notice of, in bringing that very <HI>re&s;pectable A&s;&s;embly</HI> into being at fir&s;t, than his ble&s;&s;ing and pre&s;ence with them, &s;ince.</P>
<P>HOW evidently, did God ble&s;s and direct them in the appointment of able Generals for our army, and e&s;pecially of his EXCELLENCY GE|NERAL
<PB N="22" REF="016685_0020_0F9D77E1640E6860">
WASHINGTON, the commander in chief, who&s;e prudence, wi&s;dom, &s;kill and cou|rage have all along been the envy of his enemies, and admiration of his friends.</P>
<P>FURTHERMORE, How plainly has <HI>the help of the Lord</HI> appeared in the many deliverances wro't for our army in one time of danger and another? What &s;alvations, has God granted? What &s;ucce&s;&s;es, has he given them&mdash;in &s;ome in|&s;tances very remarkable indeed! Which have been mentioned before upon this anniver&s;ary.</P>
<P>LET us go on then, to mention <HI>the help of the Lord,</HI> in the &s;uccours we received from foreign powers in warlike &s;tores, &amp;c.&mdash; but e&s;pecially in that open, generous alliance formed between his <HI>Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty,</HI> and the <HI>United States of America.</HI> Al&s;o the ble&s;&s;ing and <HI>help of the Lord</HI> is great, in pre&s;erv|ing the union of the&s;e States, when every method has been u&s;ed both from within, and without our|&s;elves, to di&s;unite and weaken us. And we may reckon among the ble&s;&s;ings of God, the remarkable health which has been generally enjoyed in the cour&s;e of the war,&mdash;altho' &s;ome particular places have been vi&s;ited with &s;ickne&s;s. And al&s;o, that God has hitherto granted us provi&s;ions for the &s;upport of our armies. But the time would fail me, to mention the one half of the in&s;tances in which the help of the Lord has been remark|ably experienced.&mdash;Surely if we add to what
<PB N="23" REF="016685_0021_0F9D77E222A86FC0">
has been mentioned, the goodne&s;s of God in continuing to us the privileges of the go&s;pel, it mu&s;t be granted that we have rea&s;on to <HI>&s;et up our Ebenezer and &s;ay, hitherto hath the Lord helped us.</HI></P>
<P>AND now, my friends, &s;uch helps of the Lord, it becomes us to recognize upon this occa&s;ion, even when met together to deprecate the horrors of war in general&mdash;the bloody &s;cenes of this in particular&mdash;more e&s;pecially the inhuman murders that were committed in this place, when the <HI>Flames</HI> of <HI>War</HI> fir&s;t broke out among us.</P>
<P>THIS <HI>day</HI> and this <HI>a&s;&s;embly</HI> are the memorial of the <HI>nineteenth of April,</HI> 1775.</P>
<P>AND this is the place, where the bloody tra|gedy begun.</P>
<P>THIS very hou&s;e is a monument of the violence and rage of our enemies! &mdash;and here, is the (<HI>Aceldama</HI> or) Field of Blood, where &s;o many of our friends wallowed in their gore.&mdash; O dreadful day! O &s;hocking event!</P>
<P>INDEED &s;uch as regard not a providence herein, may ra&s;hly &s;ay, with Job, in the bit|terne&s;s of his &s;ouls.&mdash;"Let that day be darkne&s;s, let not God regard it from above, neither let the light &s;hine upon it. Let dark|ne&s;s and the &s;hadow of death &s;tain it, let a cloud
<PB N="24" REF="016685_0022_0F9D77E2E40B9D88">
dwell upon it, let the blackne&s;s of the day terrify it."</P>
<P>BUT we, rather, acknowledge the righteous hand of God,&mdash;and wi&s;h our bereaved friends, may hear the rod and who hath appointed it,&mdash; and acknowledge with us, the help of the Lord in that day, when God remembered mercy in the mid&s;t of judgment.</P>
<P>SUCH is the make of man&mdash;and &s;uch the feelings of the human heart, e&s;pecially when under the aids of religion, as rendered impo&s;&s;ible that we &s;hould not &s;ympathize with you, my friends, in that day of uncommon di&s;tre&s;s.&mdash;But who could adopt the feelings of tho&s;e who &s;aw their hou&s;es in flames, and dwelling-places, by the malice of an enemy, &s;inking into ruins?</P>
<P>HOW much le&s;s, the piercing angui&s;h of &s;oul, which they endured, who&s;e friends&mdash;Fathers&mdash; Hu&s;bands or Children, were left breathle&s;s corp&s;es on the ground?</P>
<P>SUCH a &s;ight, or &s;uch tidings, in con&s;equence of the helli&s;h machinations of an enemy, mu&s;t afflict the &s;oul with the mo&s;t &s;tinging remor&s;e.</P>
<P>FOR your &s;upport, we have in our re&s;pective &s;tations and capacities, mo&s;t ardently prayed to God,&mdash;and with you we &s;till &s;ympathize.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="016685_0023_0F9D77E3A20A62D0">BUT have you not even in the days of your mourning, experienced much <HI>of the help of the Lord?</HI>&mdash;the goodne&s;s of God in &s;upporting you under your trials? In &s;anctifying your bereave|ments? In wiping away your tears? So that you have rea&s;on to acknowledge "hitherto hath the Lord helped us." O then &s;till commit your way to God&mdash;ca&s;t your burden upon him, "a father of the fatherle&s;s and a judge of the wi|dows, is God in his holy habitation."</P>
<P>BUT altho' my friends, your calamities made the fir&s;t, and therefore the deepe&s;t impre&s;&s;ions on our &s;ympathetic hearts: Yet how many hundred families? and how many thou&s;and &s;ouls, have &s;ince become your brethren in di&s;|tre&s;s? di&s;tre&s;s attended with more aggravating circum&s;tances &s;till. For, as has been ob&s;erved to you upon this occa&s;ion, before; "your friends, altho' murdered by the enemy&mdash;&s;leep quietly here, while others are lamenting the lo&s;s of their friends, equally dear to them, who&s;e bones are &s;cattered at the grave's mouth, or have been inhumanly buried with the burial of an a&s;s, drawn and ca&s;t forth."</P>
<P>BUT be&s;ide, how many have the de&s;olations of war, and wantonne&s;s of the enemy, &s;tript of habitations, who have, now, no certain dwel|ling-places to hide their weeping eyes, or con|&s;ole their aching hearts.</P>
<P>O, HOW are the mi&s;eries of war to be deprecated!</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="016685_0024_0F9D77E471B68830">FATHERS &s;tooping for age, are bowed down more heavily, under the lo&s;&s;es of &s;ons that were the &s;upport of their years, and confidence of their grey heads. And widows, at this day, in tears, with their fatherle&s;s children around them cry|ing for bread&mdash;a &s;ituation that mu&s;t move the compa&s;&s;ions of a &s;tone! We mu&s;t, then, mingle our tears with their's al&s;o, and divide our pity and prayers betwixt them and you&mdash; and mu&s;t even reque&s;t you to join with us, in our mo&s;t ardent cries to God&mdash;the father of mercies, that he would compa&s;&s;ionate the di&s;|tre&s;&s;es of &s;uch&mdash;&s;anctify their &s;orrows to them, and feed, cover and defend them, until the&s;e calamities are overpa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>I WOULD now turn a particular addre&s;s to the military companies, who appear in arms to aid and honor this &s;olemnity.</P>
<P>MY friends, it is owing to <HI>the help of the Lord.</HI>&mdash;to his &s;paring di&s;tingui&s;hing mer|cy, that you e&s;caped, that day when your neighbours and fellow-&s;oldiers &s;lept in death! And while God has made their deaths an admonition to you to be ready&mdash;even for a &s;ud|den death your&s;elves;&mdash;&s;o to hear that the "voice of your brother's blood crieth to God from the ground."&mdash;It was here, by the permi&s;&s;ion of providence, that an ideal war, was fir&s;t converted into reality.&mdash; here the &s;word was fir&s;t drawn, and here the flames of war fir&s;t broke out, which have &s;ince &s;pread through the land.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="016685_0025_0F9D77E5A6FDA8B0">THE bravery and prudence, &s;o con&s;picuous in the militia of <HI>Lexington,</HI> on that alarming day, which we commemorate; have, I believe, met with univer&s;al approbation. And a de&s;ire to avenge the blood of your &s;laughtered bre|thren and defend your country, has led you to cultivate the art of war, and in&s;pired you with the &s;pirit and re&s;olution of &s;oldiers,&mdash;a character which the pre&s;ent times have taught us, is mo&s;t re&s;pectable indeed. Soldiers are an order of men of as high importance as any at all: Yea, they are the very <HI>guardians</HI> of other orders, and one of the <HI>main pillars</HI> of the &s;tate:&mdash;Soldiers when under the re&s;traints of con&s;cience, and religious principles, &s;hine, with as brilliant a character, and are as ju&s;tly e&s;teemed as any &s;et of men what&s;oever.</P>
<P>AND as God, in his providence, called you into the fore-front of danger, &s;trive to be fore|mo&s;t in cultivating the nece&s;&s;ary art of war. And as the war has &s;pread from this place&mdash;from this place may military &s;kill be diffu&s;ed likewi&s;e.

<P>And NOW. I &s;hall conclude, with a word to this whole a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="016685_0026_0F9D77E5E22E6D60">ALTHOUGH he that girdeth on the harne&s;s may not boa&s;t him&s;elf as he that putteth it off, &mdash;yet &s;ince God has thus far &s;upported our cau&s;e, and granted us &s;o many and &s;uch won|derful deliverances; &s;o many &s;alvations,&mdash;given us rea&s;on to &s;ay, <HI>hitherto hath the Lord helped us</HI>; can we di&s;honor him, and &s;o much deba&s;e our chri&s;tian character, as to di&s;tru&s;t the good|ne&s;s of his providence for the future? or con|tinue our &s;ins which have before incurred his anger? let us realize, that as it was our wicked|ne&s;s that drawed down the&s;e judgments upon us, &s;o it is &s;in only that can &s;eperate between us and our God for the future. "But, they that tru&s;t in the Lord &s;hall be as Mount Zion, which cannot be removed."&mdash;Tru&s;t in him, then, at all times ye people, pour out your hearts before him, God is a refuge for us.

<P>Truly it is yet a day of darkne&s;s&mdash;but, re|member, light is &s;own for the righteous, and gladne&s;s for the upright in heart.
