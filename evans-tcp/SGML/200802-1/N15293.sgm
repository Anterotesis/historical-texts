<P>THE following Sermon, with its Appendix, is pub|li&s;hed at the reque&s;t of &s;everal characters of di&s;|tinction in this county, with a large number of people who attended the execution. The hazardous and unea&s;y &s;ituation of the preacher; who, for the &s;ake of accommodating a very numerous a&s;&s;embly, &s;poke from a gallery window, did very much maim and retrench the ha&s;ty compo&s;ition he had provided for the occa&s;ion. This circum&s;tance added to a &s;cene &s;o rare, &s;ingular and &s;olemn, with the eager and attentive multitudes pre&s;ent, &s;ugge&s;ted the hope of utility from its publication in the pre&s;ent enlarged form. The pre|vailing &s;entiments of a con&s;iderable number of per&s;ons, the ignorance and licentiou&s;ne&s;s of others, and the common in|tere&s;ts of government, evidently require a popular di&s;&s;er|tation on burglary. A good intention will therefore ju&s;tify the following attempt; while the manner of its execution can hone&s;tly plead an excu&s;e, the novelty of the &s;ubject; and that it was, a part of the definition excepted, imma|turely the re&s;ult of the writer's own reflections, una&s;&s;i&s;ted by any page on the &s;ubject he ever &s;aw.</P>

<P>'And he &s;aid unto Je&s;us, Lord remember me when thou come&s;t into thy Kingdom; and Je&s;us &s;aid unto him, verily I &s;ay unto you, to Day &s;halt thou be with me in Paradi&s;e.'</P></Q>

<P>IN this pitiable object, who &s;tands before us, we behold, at once, an in&s;tance of the folly and wick|edne&s;s of human nature, and a moving <HI>&s;pectacle</HI> of won|der and horror, 'to the world, to angels, and to men.' He is one of our kindred race, who, for a capital crime, has lately received, from an earthly tribunal, a &s;entence of death, which is this day to be carried into final, fa|tal execution upon him.</P>
<P>This is the tragical &s;cene, and mo&s;t &s;olemn occa&s;ion, which have brought together this numerous a&s;&s;embly. O the day, the critical day, is come! the deci&s;ive hour is at hand, which mu&s;t end a mortal life, and fix an im|mortal &s;oul in heaven or hell! before this &s;un goes down, his body, now vigorous and active, will be a lifele&s;s gha&s;tly corps, coffined and buried, deep down among the &s;heeted dead, while his ever-exi&s;ting &s;oul, like the dying mi&s;er's in the go&s;pel, 'this night,' yea, before night, 'will be required of him,' and &s;ent into the world of &s;pirits, to &s;mile or mourn forever. To this poor pri&s;oner, therefore, if not to &s;ome of us, it is beyond all doubt, that this is the la&s;t opportunity for public wor&s;hip; and the only me&s;&s;age from the go&s;pel of peace, which he will ever hear in this world. And O may he &s;o hear that his &s;oul &s;hall live! for this, 'God forbid that any of us &s;hould cea&s;e to pray,' until he cea&s;es to breath&mdash;let every heart in this great audience, be lifted up to heaven, in fervent, united prayer to the 'Father of Mercies,' that the &s;ame 'exceeding abun|dant grace,' which was once &s;o gloriou&s;ly magnified, and mo&s;t triumphantly di&s;played, in pardoning a penitent
<PB N="6" REF="019407_0005_0FABAAE3E7259370">
thief, may this day reach and conquer the heart of this malefactor. Oh that the divine Philanthropi&s;t, the in|imitable original of all love and compa&s;&s;ion to our guilty race, who once &s;poke from his own cro&s;s, the merciful words recorded in the text, to a dying criminal, would again &s;peak, 'as the Lord from Heaven,' to another, and '&s;ay unto him, this day &s;halt thou be with me in Paradi&s;e.'</P>
<P>SUCH ob&s;ervations and memoirs, on the life of this penitent malefactor and his unrelenting companion, as can be made practically u&s;eful, I propo&s;e to con&s;ider, carefully avoiding all unconcerning &s;peculations, all dry unaffecting truths, le&s;t I incur upon this occa&s;ion the de&s;erved cen&s;ure of that cruel father, who, 'when his &s;on a&s;ks him for bread will give him a &s;tone.' 'This I &s;ay brethren, the time is &s;hort,' every moment is pre|cious beyond compari&s;on, an immortal &s;oul is at &s;take; &s;ome of the la&s;t &s;ands in the gla&s;s of a mortal life are this in&s;tant falling upon the very verge of life, ju&s;t ready to plunge into eternity; there he &s;tands in jeopardy every hour, yea every pa&s;&s;ing minute. Ha&s;ten to the point then, let us immediately, the intere&s;ting practical point, which for the &s;ake of method, may be divided and di&s;tinctly con&s;idered in the manner following:</P>
<P N="1">I. DESCRIBE the character of this dying thief, as a real penitent.</P>
<P N="2">II. CONSIDER the promi&s;e our Lord made to him as &s;uch.</P>
<P N="3">III. APPLY the &s;ubject to our&s;elves, and to this cri|minal in particular.</P>
<P N="1">I. THE per&s;on who&s;e character, as a penitent, we are now to de&s;cribe is by the &s;acred penmen &s;tiled a malefactor and a thief, by which it is more than pro|bable that he had been addicted to many other vices be&s;ides theft, though this alone is mentioned. An a&s;|cendant vice or ruling pa&s;&s;ion of &s;ome kinds may po&s;|&s;ibly be found &s;ingle and alone in the &s;ame per&s;on; &s;uch as avarice, intemperance and the like; but whoever
<PB N="7" REF="019407_0006_0FABAAE4C5533C48">
well con&s;iders the compo&s;ition of human nature, will at once acknowledge that tho&s;e crimes which are the re|&s;ult of deliberation and forethought (as theft u&s;ually is) can but rarely, if ever, exi&s;t alone and unaccompanied with other vices. Common &s;en&s;e hath &s;o far adopted this idea, as to frame a proverbial &s;aying upon its ge|neral truth. 'They who &s;teal will lie;' which is further &s;upported by a pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture well known by the name of Augur's prayer&mdash;'give me not poverty, le&s;t I &s;teal and lie, or take the name of my God in vain.' This being con&s;idered, it will, perhaps, be natural to conclude that this thief had been a very lewd, prophane, abandoned creature, one of the mere rabble rout of wretched men; and that he had &s;pent his days, and now almo&s;t fini&s;hed his life, in a licentious cour&s;e of flagrant vice&mdash;'as in water face an&s;wereth to face, &s;o the heart of man to man.' But how far the heart or life of the malefactor here de&s;cribed an&s;wereth to that who is here pre&s;ent, is only known to God and his own con|&s;cience. 'Cur&s;ed be that pride, for it is cruel,' and that plea&s;ure, for it is &s;ordid, ill-natured and infernal, which too often &s;eek indulgence, in upbraiding and 'tormenting' a fellow-&s;inner 'before the time.'&mdash;I have &s;ugge&s;ted a compari&s;on of characters in this in|&s;tance, as I may in &s;ome others, only for the &s;ake of &s;alutary conviction. But however vicious and profli|gate the malefactor under con&s;ideration had been, yet we are from the be&s;t authority a&s;&s;ured, that through 'the exceeding abundant grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t,' he was led to repentance, and received a full pardon; and for this cau&s;e he, as well as per&s;ecuting Saul and others, obtained mercy, that in them Je&s;us Chri&s;t might &s;hew forth all long &s;uffering, for a pattern to them who &s;hould hereafter believe on him. Let every other relenting criminal look at the&s;e patterns of mercy, and flee, in&s;tantly flee, for life, flee for refuge, to lay hold upon the hope, the &s;ame all-glorious hope &s;et before them.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="019407_0007_0FABAAE6905E6248">THE evidence upon which we con&s;ider this thief as a true penitent, ari&s;es from the &s;ub&s;equent induction of particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. HE evidently had a &s;en&s;e and conviction of heart that he de&s;erved to die&mdash;'we indeed (&s;ays he to his comrade) &s;uffer ju&s;tly, for we receive the due reward of our deeds.' This is the language of a penitent, and it implies at lea&s;t that he approved of his own &s;entence, which in ca&s;e of theft was, according to the Roman law, death, by crucifixion; nor does it appear that he once di&s;puted the ju&s;tice of a law which made his crime, or any other be&s;ides murder, a capital offence. This however has been called in que&s;tion by too many among us, and even by this pri&s;oner, who yet owns his de&s;ert of death by the divine law. The thought is indeed painful and degrading, that any &s;hould openly di&s;pute the ju&s;tice of that &s;entence, founded as it is up|on one of our own laws, and which they have this day come to &s;ee executed upon this unhappy pri&s;oner. Is there not &s;ufficient cau&s;e, my friends, for all the emo|tions of benevolent pity, and the mo&s;t generous com|pa&s;&s;ion towards his per&s;on, even while indignation and horror ari&s;e in our hearts again&s;t his crime: Certainly there is; indulge them freely then upon this occa&s;ion; our Saviour him&s;elf pitied and wept over obdurate Je|ru&s;alem, at the very time he expre&s;&s;ed his di&s;like and abhorrence of her conduct in &s;toning the prophets. Re&s;entment and benevolence are 'both joined together in this divine example, let no man put them a&s;under.' No man can be tempted to do it, who properly con&s;iders the atrocious nature of burglary (the name of the crime for which this pri&s;oner mu&s;t die.) When the tender pa&s;|&s;ions ri&s;e, and run before rea&s;on, or, if through inatten|tion, or an ill-judged pity, we do not con&s;ider the nature, nor trace the con&s;equences of a crime, we &s;hall mi&s;take and pronounce that rigour and cruelty, which is only a nece&s;&s;ary guard to life, peace and property.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Appendix</NOTE> It is worthy of particular notice, that when this penitent thief
<PB N="9" REF="019407_0008_0FABAAE6E202A270">
was actually nailed to the cro&s;s, he frankly owns, for him&s;elf and his companion, that the penalty was ju&s;t in death; 'we &s;uffer ju&s;tly,' was his hone&s;t confe&s;&s;ion; and it looks like true repentance, becau&s;e it further implies that,</P>
<P N="2">2. HE had a painful and affecting &s;en&s;e of the in|trin&s;ic evil and ba&s;ene&s;s of his crime, as committed again&s;t God, and con&s;idered as a violation and contempt of <HI>his</HI> law and government. The words in which he expre&s;&s;es his guilt and de&s;ert of puni&s;hment, &s;trongly imply a &s;en&s;e and &s;orrow of heart, not merely becau&s;e he had by theft injured his fellow-men and violated a law of his country, which forbid it, but chiefly becau&s;e he had, tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed 'the law of his God,' which &s;aith, 'thou &s;halt not &s;teal'&mdash;'by this law is the knowledge of &s;in;' and here, as in a gla&s;s, the penitent beholds all the deformed features of his depraved &s;oul, and the num|berle&s;s foul &s;pots and errors of his unhallowed life: He looks within, and there he finds an heart &s;tupid and &s;tubborn, and full of the lumber of the world, proud, and prone to rebel, di&s;affected to God and his law, de|ceitful above all things, and above all, deceitful to it|&s;elf. Here on his heart lies the burden of his &s;orrow and complaint. 'The commandment is exceeding broad,' in his view, reaching every thought of his heart, as well as every action of his life; and even while he finds him&s;elf condemned by this law, he feels his very heart echoing to it, in all its precepts, prohi|bitions and penalties, as 'holy, ju&s;t and good.'&mdash;This, in a word, paints and places &s;in before his eyes, in all its hateful colours and horrid deformity: This renders it 'exceeding &s;inful,' and above all, as it is again&s;t God, a holy God. Oh the relentings and remor&s;e of David's broken heart, when he thought on his crime as committed again&s;t &s;uch a God. Swallowed up in grief and horror on this account, he &s;eems almo&s;t to have forgotten that ever he had injured Uriah or Bath&s;heba, or any other being except God:&mdash;'Again&s;t thee, thee only, have I &s;inned, and done this evil in thy &s;ight.'
<PB N="10" REF="019407_0009_0FABAAE79D5B2EB8">
Such a view of &s;in al&s;o made Jo&s;eph prefer a dungeon to forbidden plea&s;ure, and bound him, though in all the heat and vivacity of youth, 'in cords and fetters,' &s;tronger than the &s;even cords of Samp&s;on, or chains of adamant. 'How &s;hall I do this great wickedne&s;s and &s;in again&s;t God.' This, to add one in&s;tance more, this pierced deepe&s;t into the heart of the prodigal &s;on, when 'he came to him&s;elf,' and thought on a return, and on what he had been doing; 'father (&s;aid he) I have &s;inned again&s;t heaven, and before thee.' A view of &s;in like this is an e&s;&s;ential ingredient in the nature of all true repentance; for a per&s;on may hate &s;in, and be very &s;orry for it, merely becau&s;e it has blackened his character, hurt his temporal intere&s;t, di&s;graced his family, brought pain and puni&s;hment on his body, or becau&s;e it will ruin his &s;oul forever&mdash;If &s;uch &s;orrow as this were true repentance, then Judas and Pharaoh and Simon Magus, and almo&s;t all malefactors condemned to die, are true penitents. Self-love, and not the love of God, aver&s;ion to pain, and not to &s;in as &s;uch, are the principles from whence flow all &s;orrow and re|pentance of this kind; while that which de&s;erves the name is a very different and much more di&s;intere&s;ted thing; it &s;prings from a real &s;en&s;e and &s;ight of the ma|lignity of &s;in, in its own nature; and hence every true penitent has a kind of inbred antipathy, a deep-rooted hatred to every &s;in, to one as well as another; like David 'he hates every fal&s;e way,' without one excepti|on, and without any indulgence to a favourite iniquity.</P>
<P>BUT the &s;orrows of true repentance, will appear &s;till more kindly and ingenuous, if we con&s;ider</P>
<P N="3">3. THAT a belief of the pardoning mercy of God through Chri&s;t is implied in it; and this is another proof that this thief was really a penitent; for he ad|dre&s;&s;es our Saviour with the title of Lord, 'Lord re|member me in thy kingdom;' which implies a belief of the divinity of his per&s;on, his mi&s;&s;ion and commi&s;&s;ion from God, his delegated authority in the kingdom of providence and grace, with the compleatne&s;s of his
<PB N="11" REF="019407_0010_0FABAAE85C719DC0">
atonement and perfection of his righteou&s;ne&s;s unto all, and upon all that believe. Were it not for the hope of mercy and forgivene&s;s with God, to a penitent, his would &s;ink under the weight of numberle&s;s, &s;oul crimes, into &s;ullen de&s;pair. Adam, without a reve|lation of mercy, never would have &s;olicited for pardon, but remained incorrigibly wicked, like the apo&s;tate angels, who being excluded the hope of pardon, are confirmed in eternal rebellion; from which apo&s;tate man is delivered, only by tho&s;e reviving beams of hope, which emanating from Je&s;us, the glorious &s;on of righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, and pa&s;&s;ing through the go&s;pel, that ble&s;&s;ed medium of his grace, enter the dark ill-boding &s;oul, and di&s;pel the incumbent gloom of hopele&s;s horror and torpid de&s;pair; believing that paradi&s;e is open to re|pentance, and Je&s;us hath power in heaven, as he once had on earth, to forgive &s;ins, yea, that he is actually ex|alted at God's right-hand, to give remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins as well as repentance. The guilty offender looks to him for both; to him who was pierced he looks, and mourns, being him&s;elf pierced and melted by the kindly beams of a Saviour's love. On his merits alone he re&s;ts, and not on the merit of his own repentance, prayers, or reformation, to recommend him to the di|vine favour; and if pardoning mercy is found, with what rapturous joy and filial affection, gratitude and admiration, does the pardoned penitent magnify and extol the divine mercy! Like Niobe, the forgiven fe|male penitent, who at once melted into a flood of nitential tears, and 'loved much, becau&s;e much was forgiven her.' Again,</P>
<P N="4">4. A TRUE penitent is always willing and ready to confe&s;s his &s;ins; and this te&s;timony al&s;o have we, that this malefactor's repentance plea&s;ed God; for he made a very humble public confe&s;&s;ion, and it really looks like an hone&s;t one, becau&s;e it came from his own mouth freely, Sorrow, upon a real &s;ight of the turpitude and ba&s;ene&s;s of &s;in, does not more freely flow from the heart, than confe&s;&s;ion from the mouth will follow:
<PB N="12" REF="019407_0011_0FABAAEC56D93E40">
Extorted confe&s;&s;ions are always &s;u&s;pected, and well they may, for Judas, the traitor, made a confe&s;&s;ion, yea and re&s;titution al&s;o, but they were both good for nothing, unle&s;s to prove him a hypocrite, becau&s;e they were both forced from him by the rack and torture of a guilty con&s;cience, and the dread of puni&s;hment. This, and not any real repentance for his crime, wrung them out. This al&s;o kindled up &s;uch an hell within as drove him on, in frantic horror, to make his e&s;cape, by leap|ing into an hell before him. 'I have &s;inned (&s;ays he) in that I have betrayed innocent blood, and he ca&s;t down the pieces of &s;ilver, and went and hanged him&s;elf.' How different this, from the bitter repentance of Peter, the confe&s;&s;ion and re&s;titution of Zacheus and others, who, from a real and inveterate hatred of &s;in, have both confe&s;&s;ed and for&s;aken it. Let every one therefore who hopes to find mercy of the Lord remember his faults this day, and make confe&s;&s;ion of them, both to God and man, to tho&s;e in particular whom we have at any time injured, either in name or intere&s;t; and 'as much as in us lieth,' make all rea&s;onable &s;atisfaction, relying upon the divine mercy and promi&s;e for pardon; 'if we confe&s;s our &s;ins, God is faithful and ju&s;t to for|give them, and to clean&s;e us from all unrighteou&s;ne&s;s.'</P>
<P N="5">5. THE fear of God, with which the heart of this malefactor was principled and governed, bears further atte&s;tation to the &s;incerity of his repentance: Addre&s;&s;ing his companion, he &s;aid, 'do&s;t not thou fear God.' I fear him, and therefore dare not affront him, as thou doe&s;t, by prophanely mocking and railing on his dying &s;on. The fear of God, when &s;weetened and animated with love, is that filial reverence and pious pa&s;&s;ion of the &s;oul, which, in &s;cripture, is &s;o fre|quently put for the whole circle of chri&s;tian graces and duties. To fear God and keep his commandments is the whole duty of man; it is one of the mo&s;t active principles in the compo&s;ition of a heaven-born &s;oul; it gently touches all its inmo&s;t &s;prings, and &s;ets the &s;oul in motion, rapid ince&s;&s;ant motion, towards its
<PB N="13" REF="019407_0012_0FABAAEDF719BA68">
proper object, re&s;training at once from every ap|pearance of evil, and con&s;training to a uniform, uni|ver&s;al obedience. Under the influence of this &s;acred pa&s;&s;ion Nehemiah renounced tho&s;e oppre&s;&s;ive mea&s;ures which former governors had pur&s;ued; '&s;o did not I, becau&s;e of the fear of God;' and 'moved with fear' of the &s;ame kind, 'Noah prepared an ark,' in obedience to the will and warning of his God, Heb. 11. In this, con&s;idered either as a pa&s;&s;ion or principle, true repen|tance is evidently implied, and mu&s;t in both ca&s;es be taken into the account, as a material ingredient; for 'by their fruits ye &s;hall know them,' as well as other graces in their true di&s;tinctive characters, &s;o far as they can be known; but the fruits of both fear and repentance are the &s;ame, and interchangeably produce each other. Agreeably when the apo&s;tle is enumerating the fruits of godly &s;orrow and repentance unto &s;alvation, he gives fear a place in the li&s;t; 'what carefulne&s;s it wrought in you, yea, what indignation, yea, what <HI>fear, &amp;c.</HI>' Upon the other hand, we read, '<HI>fear</HI> the Lord, and depart from evil; &s;tand in <HI>awe,</HI> and &s;in not.' From all which it is manife&s;t, that evangelical obedience and reformation are equally the fruit both of fear and repentance, and therefore, as this thief feared God, he was a penitent. But further,</P>
<P N="6">6. THE admonition which he gave to his &s;uffering companion on the cro&s;s is an additional evidence of the genuine&s;s of his repentance: When this impious thief railed upon Chri&s;t, and &s;aid, 'if thou be the Chri&s;t, come down from the cro&s;s and &s;ave thy&s;elf and us.' The other looked upon him with anger, being grieved for the hardne&s;s of his heart, and &s;aid, 'thou, even thou thy&s;elf art in the &s;ame condemnation,' and yet dare&s;t thou with thy dying breath thus enhance thy guilt, and add to all thy other crimes &s;uch in&s;olence and outrage, even in the immediate view of death and the judgment &s;eat. 'Thus he was reproved.' This faithful reprover having him&s;elf ta&s;ted, yea, was now actually drinking the bitter cup, 'the wormwood and the gall,' of a vi|cious
<PB N="14" REF="019407_0013_0FABAAEEE2842E80">
life, and knew full well that &s;in was the &s;ting of &s;orrow as well as of death; 'when he &s;aw this thief, he con&s;ented with him, and was a partaker both of his &s;ins and of his plagues.' What now can he do more? Nay, what can he do le&s;s, than give him a parting reproof, and bid others take warning? It is the la&s;t opportunity, and perhaps the only way left to make any compen|&s;ation for the injury he had done his &s;oul, which was now ready to &s;ink into the bottomle&s;s pit: He pities him; his heart is full of benevolence, and in his tongue is the law of kindne&s;s; he openeth his mouth, and a reproof, the <HI>reproof of wi&s;dom,</HI> is there, with which he makes his la&s;t, his dying effort, to <HI>&s;ave</HI> his wretched comrade, 'pulling him out of the fire.' Let others '<HI>learn of him to go and do likewi&s;e.</HI>' Unblameable and unreprovable in the &s;ight of all men, and pure as the gold of which the &s;nuffers in the Jewi&s;h &s;anctuary were made, ought they, in general, to be, who undertake the office of correcting and reforming others; yet 'the day of death,' the la&s;t hour of life, gives to the vile&s;t a kind of licence to &s;peak, and adds weight and energy to their dying words. May they be, in every &s;uch in|&s;tance, 'the words of truth and &s;oberne&s;s,' of admo|nition and warning to all, e&s;pecially to tho&s;e who have been either principals or accomplices in wickedne&s;s, or who may after all once dare to do as others have done. Experience, fatal indeed to &s;ome, but 'life from the dead' to others, if the fault be not their own, &s;peaks to our eyes as their words do in our ears; and the plain language of both is, 'the way of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion is hard,' 'a companion of fools &s;hall be de&s;troyed;' and that '&s;in, though &s;weet in the mouth, is bitter in the belly, and ever will be bitterne&s;s in the latter end.'</P>
<P N="7">7. THE tender concern which this malefactor &s;hewed for the glory of God, and the honor and reputation of his injured Son, is another &s;ub&s;tantial proof of his real penitence. He 'gave glory to God, by making con|fe&s;&s;ion,' and by vindicating the character of his dear Son. The barbarous treatment which his innocent
<PB N="15" REF="019407_0014_0FABAAEF25922DE8">
Lord received from the rude multitude, the in&s;ults offered him, when &s;uffering the keen tortures of cru|cifixion, and actually in the agonies of death, deeply affected him. 'The reproaches of them that reproached him,' fell heavy upon his heart; it was full, and he opened his mouth and &s;aid, 'this man hath done nothing ami&s;s&mdash;we indeed &s;uffer guilty, but he is harm|le&s;s and holy.' The other thief joined the multitude in mocking and condemning Chri&s;t, expecting per|haps in that way to get a relea&s;e&mdash;But this man &s;tands alone, and dares, in direct oppo&s;ition to the rooted, rancorous prejudices of the people, and in defiance of the &s;entence of two courts again&s;t him, he dares openly <HI>ju&s;tify and acquit</HI> him; 'this man hath done nothing ami&s;s.' Here is the hone&s;t intrepidity of virtue! And it ever ought to be expected, that every dying penitent will, in his la&s;t moments, and in all his &s;uf|ferings 'ju&s;tify God,' and vindicate, at every ri&s;que, tho&s;e innocent per&s;ons and characters that may have been wronged by their means: This is a debt of re&s;ti|tution, which every man owes his God and country; yea, commutative ju&s;tice lays its hands on every of|fender, and like the rigorous &s;ervant in the parable, takes him by the throat, &s;aying, 'pay me that thou owe&s;t.' Once more,</P>
<P N="8">8. La&s;t. EVERY real penitent, as &s;uch, is a man of prayer. 'The Lord is good and ready to forgive, and plenteous in mercy unto all that call upon him;' and upon him for mercy the repenting &s;inner will call with as much fervency as Daniel prayed in the lion's den, or Jo|nah in the belly of hell, for deliverance. Stung with a &s;en&s;e of his guilt, penitent David prays as if the gho&s;t of Uriah, be&s;pattered with blood was con&s;tantly in his &s;ight, and actually reproaching him for his treacherous cruelty; 'deliver me, O God (&s;ays he) thou God of my &s;alvation, deliver me from blood-guiltine&s;s, have mercy on me, O Lord; according to the multitude of thy tender mercies, blot out my tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, wa&s;h me from mine iniquity, and clean&s;e me from my &s;in.'
<PB N="16" REF="019407_0015_0FABAAEFE009D7E0">
This is prayer, and a proof of genuine penitence. Such proof as this had this condemned thief, that he was him&s;elf a penitent in heart, 'for behold he prayeth,' 'Lord remember me in thy kingdom:' This was his prayer, the prayer of a dying thief to a dying Saviour; it was &s;hort, but a very comprehen&s;ive prayer; it con|tains, yea, it really is, the prayer of faith, of humility, and of great importunity; he addre&s;&s;es Chri&s;t as Lord, the Lord of a kingdom which was not of this world: and this, as already ob&s;erved, implies faith; he &s;hews great humility in his prayer to this all-&s;ufficient Saviour, 'Lord remember me.' He &s;eeks for no pre|ferment; he a&s;ks not to &s;it on his right-hand or his left in his kingdom, as others had done; neither does he pre&s;cribe any particular way in which he would be remembered; he only begs a remembrance with Chri&s;t, that is all; and for this he is exceedingly earne&s;t and importunate. He &s;eems to breathe out his <HI>whole</HI> &s;oul in the reque&s;t, 'Lord remember me,' and I have enough, 'remember me,' and I have infinitely more than I de&s;erve! remember me, O Lord, and I a&s;k no more. 'For mercy Lord, is my reque&s;t; this is the total &s;um; mercy, good Lord, is all my &s;uit; O let thy mercy come!' Come, come it did; for 'Je&s;us &s;aid unto him, verily I &s;ay unto you, to day &s;halt thou be with me in paradi&s;e.' This was the promi&s;e which our Lord made to this praying penitent&mdash;and the import of it was,</P>
<P N="2">II. THE &s;econd con&s;ideration in the propo&s;ed method of this di&s;cour&s;e; to which I &s;hall now attend in a few words.</P>
<P>THIS promi&s;e was indeed made by our divine Lord in per&s;on, and addre&s;&s;ed to this thief in particular, while they were both upon the cro&s;s; but as Je&s;us is now in paradi&s;e above, at his Father's right-hand, and hath &s;till in his own hand the mediatorial kingdom of grace, and ever liveth to make interce&s;&s;ion for us: We may, every per&s;on who de&s;erves the character of a true penitent, may properly and per&s;onally apply the
<PB N="17" REF="019407_0016_0FABAAF0D17D9D88">
&s;ame promi&s;e to him&s;elf, and &s;ay in his dying hour, 'to day &s;hall I be with Chri&s;t in paradi&s;e.'&mdash;Paradi&s;e, in al|lu&s;ion to that delightful place on earth where our fir&s;t parents lived in their innocent, primeval &s;tate, is here put for heaven. The river of plea&s;ure, the tree of life, and other &s;cenes of earthly joy and felicity, that once were in it, rendered the place, beyond all others, the fitte&s;t re&s;emblance of that paradi&s;e above, into which the holy Je&s;us promi&s;ed this dying thief an immediate 'and abundant entrance.' This promi&s;e, if connected and compared with other pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, implies,</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT there is another life after this, or that the &s;oul will exi&s;t, after the death of the body, in a &s;eparate &s;tate. 'To day <HI>thou</HI>' i. e. thy &s;oul '<HI>&s;hall be with me, &amp;c.</HI>' And as the &s;oul is &s;aid to be not merely with angels and glorified &s;pirits, but with Je&s;us <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> who is the &s;ame ye&s;terday, to day, and forever; it further implies,</P>
<P N="2">2. THE immortality of the &s;oul, or that its exi&s;tence &s;hall never end. And al&s;o,</P>
<P N="3">3. THAT the &s;ouls of ju&s;t men are <HI>immediately</HI> after death made perfect; being ab&s;ent from the body, are pre&s;ent with the Lord in a paradi&s;e of everla&s;ting joy. '<HI>To day</HI> &s;halt thou be with me in paradi&s;e.' But a par|ticular con&s;ideration of the&s;e truths mu&s;t, for the pre|&s;ent, give place to another, very evidently implied in the promi&s;e, and which is indeed the wonder, weight and glory of it: It is the a&s;toni&s;hing grace and conde|&s;cen&s;ion of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t toward peri&s;hing men. How willing and ready is the all-loving and all-lovely Sa|viour, to hear the prayer of the humble and contrite &s;oul, and to receive it to his everla&s;ting mercy? How &s;oon did the prayer of this penitent reach the ear of the all-compa&s;&s;ionate Redeemer? '<HI>While he was yet &s;peaking,</HI>' Je&s;us an&s;wered 'Amen.' Thy petition is given thee; to the half, yea, to the whole of my kingdom; in which you &s;hall have not only the remembrance of an ab&s;ent friend in my mind, but a &s;eat in my kingdom, yea, a place in my very bo&s;om; 'that where I am,
<PB N="18" REF="019407_0017_0FABAAF16DB6E180">
there you may be al&s;o, and behold my glory.' O what a marvellous mixture of unrivalled mercy and dignity are here di&s;played in triumph! Mercy to the dying thief, but dignity and regal maje&s;ty, in &s;peaking to him, from the cro&s;s, as from a throne; not only 'to di&s;pen&s;e pardons, but di&s;po&s;e of &s;eats in paradi&s;e.' The Saviour was now agonizing on the cro&s;s, with every appendage of infamy and di&s;tre&s;s, de&s;erted by his friends and by his God, while his mercile&s;s enemies were in&s;ulting and triumphing over him; yet he endured all with patience; and with the thunder-bolts of their in|&s;tant de&s;truction in his hand, this meek, inoffen&s;ive Lamb opened not his mouth; he was deaf and dumb to all the bitter reproaches, both of the multitude and of this abandoned thief, then expiring at his &s;ide; but as &s;oon as the other addre&s;&s;ed him in prayer, he heard, he &s;poke, and heaven was given him at his petition! Oh the riches of almighty, unmerited grace! A par|don, a paradi&s;e of eternal happine&s;s given to a thief, offered as freely to the other, and to a third, yea, to all who will humbly and freely accept what he freely gives. Can this be po&s;&s;ible? He who made the promi&s;e fore|&s;aw that it 'would be thought a thing incredible with us,' and therefore he hath confirmed it with an oath; '<HI>verily,</HI> I &s;ay unto you, to day, &amp;c.' This is indeed an in&s;tance of the power of &s;overeign, &s;urprizing grace, at which men and angels will never cea&s;e to admire and wonder; but it &s;tands not alone; other trophies have been erected beneath the banners of the &s;ame cro&s;s: Saul, of Tar&s;us, a bloody per&s;ecutor, the oppre&s;&s;ing Zacheus, a publican, murderous Mana&s;&s;eh, the ido|later, yea, the betrayers and murderers of the Son of God at Jeru&s;alem, with that long black roll of noto|rious criminals at Corinth. The&s;e, '&s;uch were the&s;e,' and &s;uch have been numbers more, 'but they are wa&s;hed,' in the very blood, which &s;ome of their own wicked hands had &s;hed, 'but they are &s;anctified, but they are ju&s;tified, in the name of the Lord Je&s;us, and by the &s;pirit of our God.' And through the power of
<PB N="19" REF="019407_0018_0FABAAF243C2B138">
the &s;ame meritorious blood, peace and pardon await the guilty &s;till. Grace is yet on the throne, and 'reigns through righteou&s;ne&s;s unto eternal life.' Its &s;phere of benign influence hath extended back to the beginning of the creation of God, and will reach forward to the general conflagration, 'and nothing is hid from the heat thereof; it is unto all, and upon all that believe,' without difference either of time, place or character. Gracious encouragement! joyful truth! and written too, as with a &s;un-beam, in the repeated and indefinite invitations of the glorious go&s;pel: 'Whoever will let him come, and him that cometh I will in no wi&s;e ca&s;t out,' is his language, who came to bring peace on earth and good-will to men: For this he breathed forth that mo&s;t pathetical wi&s;h, 'O that thou had&s;t known in this thy day the things which belong unto thy peace!' For this he poured out that ardent prayer, even for his murderers, 'Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.' For this his tears flowed out with his prayers; 'Je&s;us wept,' when he beheld the city of Jeru&s;alem, where his murderers lived; he melted into tears of compa&s;&s;ion over tho&s;e inhuman wretches who crucified and &s;lew the Lord of glory: Yea, let higher wonder ri&s;e, for he, after all this, made the fir&s;t offer of him&s;elf as a Saviour to tho&s;e who nailed him to the cro&s;s as a malefactor&mdash;and that none might &s;u&s;pect the &s;incerity of his heart in all he has &s;aid and done, he hath even &s;worn, that he hath no plea&s;ure in the death of the wicked, but that he turn and live. Now, if the mo&s;t winning invitations, &s;olemn oaths, pathetic wi&s;hes, affectionate tears, and ardent prayers cannot &s;ufficiently prove his love and willingne&s;s to &s;ave, then reject them all, refu&s;e his oath, and take his blood in proof of the darling point; for this he &s;hed as well as his tears, this he poured forth as well as his prayers, for tho&s;e who&s;e wicked hands &s;pilt and reeked with his vital gore! Is this the manner of man, O Lord? Are not the chief offenders made examples of ju&s;tice? With men they are, but with Je&s;us they are &s;ometimes
<PB N="20" REF="019407_0019_0FABAAF646C640C0">
the cho&s;en ve&s;&s;els and examples of his mercy! Be not faithle&s;s then, nor &s;u&s;picious of Chri&s;t's willingne&s;s to &s;ave; for it is infinitely greater than your own to be &s;aved by him. That a king on earth &s;hould be more ready to pardon than the rebel to receive it, is incre|dible indeed; but let Je&s;us be king, and it is true as the everla&s;ting go&s;pel which declares it. 'O Jeru&s;alem, Jeru&s;alem (&s;aid Chri&s;t, with tears in his eyes) how often would I have gathered thee, but you would not.' Hear this, with a dull in&s;en&s;ibility, or &s;tupid indifference who can? Believe this, guilty man, and leap for joy, look to Je&s;us, and immediately lay hold on eternal life! But this leads me</P>
<P N="3">III. To apply the &s;ubject.</P>
<P N="1">1. WHAT a marvellous illu&s;tration does the &s;ubject give us, both of the efficacy and inefficacy of the means of grace, upon different per&s;ons under the &s;ame circum&s;tances. Here are two men who had committed the &s;ame crime, both thieves, condemned to the &s;ame death, and at the &s;ame time nailed to the &s;ame cro&s;s, at equal di&s;tance perhaps from the &s;ame Saviour, who hung between them both; and both, for aught ap|pears, enjoyed equal advantages from the in&s;tructions and example of Chri&s;t; and yet 'Chri&s;t crucified was to the one as a Saviour of life unto life, and to the other of death unto death.' One &s;aw the Saviour in the &s;uf|ferer, and became a penitent, the other refu&s;ed, and hardened his heart. One of them went out of the world praying to the Saviour of it, the other expired reviling and cur&s;ing him.&mdash;If he who died a penitent was unacquainted with Chri&s;t before he came to the cro&s;s, which is the common opinion, then his con|ver&s;ion mu&s;t, and will be acknowledged a rare, but glorious in&s;tance, both of the power and &s;overeignty of divine grace; as the other evidently was of the power of &s;in, and of the &s;otti&s;hne&s;s and depravity of the hu|man heart! The heart of the &s;ons of men is full of evil, and madne&s;s is in their heart while they live.' This thief was now in the mo&s;t acute pain, the mo&s;t pungent
<PB N="21" REF="019407_0020_0FABAAF80C248158">
di&s;tre&s;s, having but a few minutes to live, upon the very point to plunge into eternity; a fellow-&s;ufferer in the agonies of death before his eyes, who&s;e dying groans doubtle&s;s pierced his ears while upon the cro&s;s, to which he was nailed, naked, and expo&s;ed to &s;hame and ignominy from the &s;coffing, &s;urrounding mul|titude, a Saviour praying for his murderers on his &s;ide, with blood &s;treaming from his mangled body, full in view; and yet, 'be a&s;toni&s;hed O heavens,' he was hardened &s;till! 'Bray a fool in a mortar, yet will not his folly depart from him.' 'So then, neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth, but God that giveth the increa&s;e;' to him let every eye look, in the diligent u&s;e of the means of his own appointment, and not vainly imagine, as &s;ome have done, that if they could but enjoy &s;uch as others have enjoyed, or as might be afforded, &s;ucce&s;s would en&s;ue; 'to the law and the te&s;timony,' the&s;e are <HI>perfect</HI>; but if the&s;e 'convert not the &s;oul, nor make wi&s;e the &s;imple,' if Mo&s;es and the prophets are not heard; 'neither will you be per&s;uaded though one ro&s;e from the dead;' nay, it would not avail, if you could this day &s;tand under the very cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, and have '<HI>all your raiment &s;tained,</HI>' with his blood di&s;tilling and &s;treaming fre&s;h upon it; or were ye even lifted up on the cro&s;s, like this thief, with a Saviour praying and dying by your &s;ide.</P>
<P N="2">2. How great and affecting is that change, which is made by death in the &s;ame per&s;on. This we have often &s;een with our own eyes; we &s;hall &s;ee it again in a few hours, in the unhappy pri&s;oner before us; and ere long we our&s;elves mu&s;t all feel and undergo it in our own per&s;ons: Yes, the faire&s;t forms and fine&s;t features, all the &s;trength and agility of body, the lilly and ro&s;e in the cheek, the &s;parkling eye and charming glee, mu&s;t all fade, &s;hortly fade away, and become lifele&s;s de|formity and loath&s;ome putrefaction. Be fond and proud of dre&s;s no more, but 'be ye cloathed with hu|mility; put on righteou&s;ne&s;s; put ye on the Lord Je&s;us
<PB N="22" REF="019407_0021_0FABAAF8DC110348">
Chri&s;t, as a robe, and for a diadem of beauty.' But great as is the change, which death makes in the body, it is &s;mall and trifling, compared to the alteration it produces in the &s;tate of the &s;oul, in the compa&s;s of one flying moment; it pa&s;&s;es from time to eternity, from ea&s;e to uncea&s;ing pain, or from pain to eternal bli&s;s; from its exi&s;tence in a body to a world of &s;eparate &s;pirits; and from earth to heaven or hell. What a tran&s;ition is this! How &s;udden and unknown, how &s;urprizing and important is the change! Are we all ready for it? 'Except a man be born again he cannot &s;ee the kingdom of God.' This is the great prepara|tory change for heaven; if we have experienced this, we are prepared for the other, and may, in our dying moments, leave this body, and 'launch into the great deep' of eternity, with as much &s;afety as Peter left the &s;hip in a &s;torm, and 'ventured to walk upon the &s;ea to go to Je&s;us,' not doubting but the &s;ame helping hand which 'caught him will be &s;tretched out to &s;ave us al&s;o from &s;inking' into the lake which burns below, and receive us into his everla&s;ting kingdom.</P>
<P N="3">3. From this one in&s;tance only of a late repentance, let no one pre&s;ume to defer his own to &s;ome future day, and yet dream of &s;ucce&s;s. To the glory of divine grace it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that a true repentance is never too late; but equally to the glory of divine ju&s;tice, it mu&s;t al&s;o be owned, that a late repentance is &s;eldom true: True indeed it was in this thief, ac|cording to the common interpretation; but to ri&s;k the immortal happine&s;s of a &s;oul, in pawn of its being the only true one, is jeopardy and folly that want a name! After all that has been &s;aid in its &s;upport, there are yet good rea&s;ons to believe, as &s;ome expo&s;itors do, that this convert had been acquainted with Chri&s;t and the nature of his kingdom while in pri&s;on, and that he actually was converted &s;ome time before he was executed; this they urge ought to be admitted as a fact, rather than an in&s;tantaneous conver&s;ion. But to wave all contro|ver&s;y, I will at pre&s;ent grant what never can be fully
<PB N="23" REF="019407_0022_0FABAAF8E9DD6458">
proved, viz. That all the divine virtues which could be crouded into &s;o narrow a &s;pace were, by a &s;udden and a&s;toni&s;hing growth, produced in him, while he was upon the cro&s;s, and that he did in reality obtain mercy with his dying ga&s;p. What then? Is this a pattern for us? A pattern it may be, but it is without a promi&s;e, and is rather a proof of what Chri&s;t can do, than of what he will do in common ca&s;es. The ca&s;e of this thief, it is certain, was peculiar and extraordinary: He never had, upon the pre&s;ent &s;uppo&s;ition, one call to re|pentance, nor one offer of mercy from Chri&s;t before in all his life; whereas, under the go&s;pel, dying &s;inners have been long and often called, and as long de&s;pi&s;ed the means and overtures of grace: 'Becau&s;e I have called (&s;ays God) and ye refu&s;ed, therefore I will laugh at your calamity, and mock when your fear cometh.' Be&s;ides it was now an extraordinary time; Chri&s;t was on the cro&s;s, ju&s;t coming to the throne, on the point of being crowned, and in&s;talled in his kingdom; his dying, royal groans, penetrated the regions of the dead, and produced univer&s;al darkne&s;s and convul&s;ions through the heavens and earth; all nature was in mourning, and echoed groan for groan re&s;pon&s;ive to her dying God. At &s;uch a time, and under &s;uch cir|cum&s;tances, this thief on the cro&s;s became a convert of the grace of Chri&s;t. But for any of us, at this day, to indulge in wickedne&s;s, in expectation of a &s;imilar event, would, in the true e&s;timate of things, be ac|counted pre&s;umption, and hazard infinitely greater than that of a malefactor, who &s;hould voluntarily commit felony, in expectation of a pardon from his &s;overeign, merely becau&s;e on the joyful day of his coronation he had once pardoned a criminal; or, if in the neglect of the ordinary means of grace, and 'the &s;till &s;mall voice' of rea&s;on and con&s;cience, any &s;hould depend upon an earthquake, or the darkne&s;s of a preternatural eclip&s;e of the &s;un, to convert him, becau&s;e a certain thief, al|mo&s;t 1800 years ago, was perhaps, fir&s;t awakened in &s;uch a miraculous way. The folly of &s;uch conduct is
<PB N="24" REF="019407_0023_0FABAAF9AE61A458">
too rank and barefaced to need a &s;erious reprobation! Add to this, that a deep and thorough repentance is a gracious habit, which, like all others, u&s;ually requires time, and a train of gradual operations, both within and from without, to fix it deep and durable in the &s;oul. Tho&s;e ha&s;ty re&s;olutions, tran&s;ient pangs of &s;or|row, and intermitting fits of joy, &s;o often mi&s;taken for '<HI>pure religion,</HI>' are frequently no more than certain mechanical operations upon the body, ari&s;ing from ex|ternal impre&s;&s;ions, or from the latent &s;eeds of &s;ome melancholy di&s;temper, which, like the &s;eeds in the parable, '&s;oon &s;prung up, and &s;oon withered away, becau&s;e they had no root or deepne&s;s of earth.' Sudden growths and changes in religion, like tho&s;e in vegetable nature, are &s;eldom &s;olid and durable; and if one ex|perienced in them &s;hould appear at fir&s;t very happy and joyful, as 'Jonah was exceeding glad of his gourd;' yet it is a thing '<HI>for which he hath not laboured, neither made it grow,</HI>' he may &s;u&s;pect a devouring '<HI>worm is at the root,</HI>' if it ever had any, and as it came up in the night, it will peri&s;h in a night, i. e. it may &s;oon be gone; while the empty pretender, who has mi&s;took a religious mood for a religious temper, will be left in the very 'gall of bitterne&s;s' and cen&s;ure, under the do|minion of lu&s;ts, far more criminal than that 'peevi&s;h temper,' which the prophet di&s;covered at the lo&s;s of his plea&s;ant &s;hade. Changes like the&s;e, however, are not more &s;u&s;picious than it is impious to put off the great work of religion to the la&s;t moments of life. To wa&s;te and wanton away upon your lu&s;ts, and the &s;ervice of this world, the flower and vigor of life, and then offer the wretched relicks of it to the great author and pre|&s;erver of life, is a mo&s;t daring affront. Ungrateful man! fooli&s;h and unwi&s;e, do you thus requite the Lord? Is this all the return you make him for all his kindne&s;s to you? Is this thy kindne&s;s to thy friend?

away their Lord for thirty pieces of &s;ilver, 'a goodly price that I was prized at of them.' A goodly price indeed, to offer the &s;ick, the blind and lame, for a Saviour in a de&s;perate ca&s;e. Offer it now to thy Governor; will he be plea&s;ed with &s;uch a &s;acrifice? No more will thy God, the Governor of the world, be plea&s;ed with the dregs of di&s;ea&s;ed or decripid age, pre&s;&s;ed out by the weight of con&s;cious guilt, and the torturing fire of a &s;tinging con&s;cience. Fair promi&s;es we know are often made in pain and di&s;tre&s;s, and as often almo&s;t are they recanted in ea&s;e and pro&s;perity; yea, &s;o commonly have the vows and re&s;olutions of a &s;ick bed died in embrio, where the patient has lived, that if the experience of ages had the weight of a grain, it would be granted upon every hand, that next to leaping headlong into hell without any repentance, is the folly of defering it to age, &s;ickne&s;s, or a dying day. But if folly of &s;uch colour and magnitude &s;hould ever once be found, let not the guilty wretch utterly de&s;pond; for in the hi&s;tory of four thou&s;and years, let him know, that there is <HI>one</HI> in&s;tance left on the &s;acred page, that none might de&s;pair, and only <HI>one,</HI> that none might de|lay.

<P>UNHAPPY young man, how di&s;appointed in your expectations, how wretched and forlorn is your con|dition!

The wages of &s;in is death; 'the &s;oul that &s;inneth, it &s;hall die, and cur&s;ed is every one who continueth not in all things written in the book of the law to do them; this is the law, with its tremendous &s;anctions and cur&s;es; and the&s;e all await you, as a tran&s;|gre&s;&s;or of it&mdash;offending in one point, you are guilty of all, and all heaven and earth will &s;ooner pa&s;s away than one jot or tittle of it fail.

In the name of God! what can be done? What &s;hall I do to be &s;aved? Is this your heart? Are you in earne&s;t?

Then, my friends, and perhaps never before, &s;hall we meet again, not merely as &s;pectators, but as per&s;onally and deeply intere&s;ted in all the momentous &s;cenes and deci&s;ions that will then take place. The apo&s;tle's wi&s;h for his friend, is mine for you and my&s;elf; 'the Lord grant we may all find mercy of him in that day.'

<P N="1">1. HERE is a mo&s;t affecting in&s;tance, my young friends, before your eyes of a vicious youth, under the age of twenty-four years, brought to a di&s;graceful, un|timely death, by the vindictive hand of public ju&s;tice; and it is at once a warning to you, and a proof that God's own words are words of truth. Look on this criminal, and believe that 'he who pur&s;ueth evil, pur|&s;ueth it to his own death,' and that wicked men &s;hall not live out half their days; believe al&s;o that he who being often reproved hardeneth his neck, &s;hall him&s;elf &s;uddenly be de&s;troyed, and that without remedy; hearken then to the voice of a reproof from your parents and friends, from the word and providence of God; take heed to your ways, &s;hun the vices and paths of the de&s;troyer; 'flee youthful lu&s;ts which war again&s;t the &s;oul,' and wound to death your own reputation and the bleeding hearts of your tender parents; beware, e&s;pe|cially beware of gaming, and that intemperate u&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors to which this ill-fated youth was &s;o in|famou&s;ly addicted, and which, by the confe&s;&s;ion of his own mouth, had the principal hand in bringing him to this mi&s;erable end. This is indeed a &s;ore evil under the &s;un, and it is now common among men; like a pe&s;tilence, 'it walketh in darkne&s;s and wa&s;teth at noon day!' A mo&s;t pernicious evil, full of deadly poi&s;on to the manners and morals of youth; a dete&s;table Pan|dora's box, whence i&s;&s;ue whole &s;warms of plagues, more numerous and fatal than tho&s;e of Egypt, to &s;ting and di&s;turb mankind in all their peace of &s;ociety, both in towns and families; yea, it now threatens with one mingled ma&s;s of ruin, the health and happine&s;s, the
<PB N="31" REF="019407_0030_0FABAB015C0BBBB8">
lives, fortunes and &s;ouls of the mo&s;t promi&s;ing part of God's creation: 'Who hath woe? Who hath &s;orrow? Who hath contentions? Who hath babling? Who hath wounds, with and without a cau&s;e? Who hath redne&s;s of eyes?' Who are poor, and &s;teal, and take the name of the Lord in vain? Who break up hou&s;es, com|mit murder, are confined to pri&s;ons, loaded with irons, and die upon the gallows? 'They that tarry long at the wine, they that go to &s;eek mixt wine, and are mighty to drink &s;trong drink.' This execution alas! will make the third in this county, occa&s;ioned by &s;pi|ritous liquors; two men in a fit of intoxication com|mitted murder, and &s;uffered the pains of death, at Bri&s;tol, upwards of 75 years ago; the&s;e were Indians, and would to God that human nature might never again be &s;o brutalized and rankly di&s;graced by any but Indians alone. Could I &s;peak in thunder, and my voice be heard from pole to pole, it &s;hould be the friendly voice of warning to young men, entreating them, by every thing that is dear and valuable, to &s;hun the company and the haunts of tipplers and gamblers; 'come not nigh the door of the hou&s;e, avoid it, pa&s;s not by it, turn from it and pa&s;s away.'</P>
<P N="2">2. THIS example of condign puni&s;hment &s;peaks aloud and home to parents and all who are entru&s;ted with the care and education of children. Next to in|temperance, as a cau&s;e, this malefactor a&s;cribes his li|centious life and ignominious death to the want of pro|per re&s;traint in youth; left to the care of a mother when young, he had, like too many others, his own way and will without controul. His parent we are told is yet alive, if a parent can live who has 'travailed in birth and drawn out the brea&s;ts' to &s;uch a &s;on! Can words expre&s;s the feelings of a parent's heart on &s;uch an oc|ca&s;ion; put your &s;oul in her &s;oul's &s;tead this day, and imagine for once, you who are parents, if the thought is not in&s;upportable, that this was your own &s;on! a &s;on who had 'made him&s;elf vile, and you re&s;trained him not,' a &s;on, who&s;e education, who&s;e morals and immortal &s;oul you had neglected, and now is trembling

in chains, with the &s;trangling noo&s;e about his neck, and 'made a gazing &s;tock' to thou&s;ands around him&mdash;at length you follow him to the place of execution; there &s;tand the father who begat him, and the mother who bore him, beholding their &s;on writhing in the agonies of death, and they for him, in agonies as great of living di&s;tre&s;s; O how they wring their hands, and almo&s;t gnaw their tongues, while they cry, 'my &s;on, my &s;on, would to God I might die for thee, O my &s;on, my &s;on,' I am the criminal, and I the guilty thief; 'his blood be upon us, and not upon our child;' we are the faulty cau&s;e; our cruel neglect of timely in&s;tructions, a good example, and the rod of correction, have mur|dered our &s;on! The Bible and experience both told us to train him up in the way he &s;hould go, and that when he was old he would not depart; we were commanded to beat him with a rod, and not &s;pare for his crying, with a promi&s;e that he &s;hould not die an untimely death, and that we &s;hould deliver his &s;oul from hell; but Oh! 'we are guilty, verily guilty, concerning our &s;on, and therefore is this di&s;tre&s;s come upon us,' as a ju&s;t puni&s;h|ment of our folly as well as his own; go now and write him a mon&s;ter! pronounce that heart 'an heart of &s;tone, which is not melted and moved out of its place;' even in &s;ympathy with &s;uch pungent parental di&s;tre&s;s; and may both the &s;leeping and waking hours of that parent, be perpetually haunted with all the tra|gical operations of this day, who can after all go home, and neglect the education of his own children; yea, let him take his rank in future with 'the cruel o&s;trich in the wilderne&s;s,' becau&s;e he is hardened again&s;t his young, as though they were not his own.</P>
<P N="3">3. THIS public example of ju&s;tice adds to the proof, already large, of the exi&s;tence and wi&s;dom of a &s;pecial providence: 'Verily there is a God that judgeth in the heavens and in the earth.' To deter men from vice, the Deity has mercifully mingled pain and puni&s;hment with the very nature and perpetration of it; if we look within we &s;hall find, we &s;hall feel a demon&s;tration of this. Envy and malice, rancor and revenge, &amp;c. are 'a ge|neration
<PB N="33" REF="019407_0032_0FABAB03AF739540">
of vipers' in the &s;oul, perpetually &s;tinging and gnawing upon it; yea, they create in that bo&s;om, which is their ne&s;t, a little dome&s;tic hell, '<HI>where the worm</HI>' of envy '<HI>dieth not, and the fire</HI>' of malice '<HI>is not quenched.</HI>' Vices torment the &s;oul, however, not mere|ly from their nature, and when &s;eparately indulged, but from their number and combination. So numerous, and &s;o contrary, in their de&s;ires and &s;eparate intere&s;ts, that they rai&s;e a kind of civil war within; for while one lu&s;t is gratified, another is di&s;plea&s;ed; while the man humours and feeds his covetou&s;ne&s;s, he is obliged to &s;tarve luxury and affront his pride; and even &s;hould 'Belzebub ca&s;t out devils,' or one predominant ma&s;ter lu&s;t conquer a number of its inferiors, there would be even in this infernal conque&s;t an oppo&s;ition, which mu&s;t create pain and vexation. But if to the mi&s;ery which is entailed on vice, in its nature and in their jaring num|bers, we add that which both attends and follows vi|cious actions, we &s;hall &s;till have a greater proof of the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of divine providence, by which it is evidently decreed, that bold tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors &s;hall not only be puni&s;hed in this world, but in numberle&s;s in|&s;tances &s;hall in fact be puni&s;hed according to the laws of a &s;trict retaliation. I have &s;een (&s;ays Eliphaz) that they who plow iniquity and &s;ow wickedne&s;s reap the &s;ame; his mi&s;chief (&s;ays the P&s;almi&s;t) &s;hall return up|on his own head, and his violent dealings &s;hall come down upon his own pate; and even after con&s;cience hath long &s;lept, and no human ju&s;tice could pur&s;ue the criminal, his own iniquity has at la&s;t found him out, and by &s;ome remarkable incident in providence brought him to de&s;erved puni&s;hment. In this view it is worthy of ob&s;ervation, that &s;oon after the commit|ment of this pri&s;oner to the goal in this town, he was providentially di&s;covered late in the night upon the point of an e&s;cape from this, as he had before done from every other pri&s;on he had been confined to; this alarmed the &s;heriff, who knowing and lamenting the enfeebled &s;tate of the gaol, thought it un&s;afe to ri&s;que a
<PB N="34" REF="019407_0033_0FABAB044DF8C840">
&s;econd attempt, and therefore appointed him a guard; and to this &s;ingle circum&s;tance, however trifling or ac|cidental it may appear, mu&s;t be a&s;cribed, under pro|vidence, the memorable event of this day. Rather than wicked men &s;hould go unpuni&s;hed, by any neglect of government, all wi&s;e providence will take occa&s;ion from that neglect, and make a &s;uperanuated gaol the very means of their execution. 'The weakne&s;s of God is &s;tronger than men,' and ever will be too &s;trong for the guilty to e&s;cape. Let us, e&s;pecially of this county, notice a providence &s;o friendly to government, and re|member that this in full cannot by done until the new propo&s;ed gaol &s;hall be compleated, with every needful precaution of &s;trength and &s;ecurity. Finally,</P>
<P>WHEN we look at this unhappy criminal, and think what would the poor wretch give that he were in our condition: Let none of us indulge, or nouri&s;h in our hearts the pride of the Phari&s;ee, or even &s;o much as think, in a way of boa&s;ting, what he &s;poke with his mouth, 'God I thank thee, that I am not as other men, or even as this malefactor;' when perhaps the principal di&s;tinction between him and numbers here pre&s;ent may be nothing more than the gilding of a coffin or the paint of a &s;epulchre; and even of &s;ome others, the difference may con&s;i&s;t only in this, that he is de|tected and condemned, but they as yet are concealed from human eye, while in the eye of God omni&s;cient, both they and we and 'all have &s;inned, and come &s;hort of his glory.' Condemned therefore by the &s;ame law, guilty before the &s;ame God, we are all the pri&s;oners of divine ju&s;tice, and equally need repentance and par|doning mercy, through the blood of the &s;ame atone|ment. 'Except ye repent, ye &s;hall all likewi&s;e peri&s;h;' repent therefore, let us all, and 'be converted, that we may have redemption through the blood of Chri&s;t, even the forgivene&s;s of &s;ins, according to the riches of his grace; and receive in the end the riches of the glory of the inheritance, in his everla&s;ting kingdom.' Amen.</P>

<P>BEFORE the execution of the criminal, which gave occa&s;ion to the preceding di&s;cour&s;e, a con|&s;iderable number, chiefly of the populace, manife&s;ted their doubts and di&s;&s;atisfaction concerning the lawfulne&s;s of the intended execution; others '<HI>raged and were confident,</HI>' that it would be a murderous bloody deed, and wi&s;hed he might e&s;cape. This &s;ugge&s;ted the pro|priety of offering in public a &s;hort vindication of his puni&s;hment. It was done, and the con&s;equence proved to &s;ome a pre&s;ent relief, but to others a more violent attack upon tho&s;e who were more immediately con|cerned in it. The judges and jury, the &s;heriff and &s;tate's-attorney, the pro&s;ecutor and the preacher, re|ceived in turn, each one <HI>his bitter portion in due &s;ea&s;on</HI>; and as the impetus of zeal and clamour &s;o furious did evidently &s;trike again&s;t government, it was thought nece&s;&s;ary in all rea&s;on to give it a check; and could rea&s;on do it, the ta&s;k were ea&s;y and &s;oon fini&s;hed; if the wi&s;dom and experience of ages, and the wi&s;e&s;t na|tions and legi&s;lators on earth; if all the &s;tatutes, cu&s;|toms and codes of unin&s;pired law, could obtain faith, or had weight, '<HI>as a grain of mu&s;tard &s;eed,</HI>' the moun|tain would be removed, and all clamour cea&s;e: But &s;ince very little advantage in this di&s;pute can be ex|pected from this quarter, no apology to the gentlemen of law or letters can be needed from one of my pro|fe&s;&s;ion, for an attempt to ju&s;tify the penalty of one of our own laws, by '<HI>rea&s;oning out of the &s;criptures,</HI>' and with arguments plainly adapted to the &s;en&s;e and feelings of this cla&s;s of people.</P>
<P>THE crime we call burglary, is the breaking open and entering a dwelling-hou&s;e in the night, with a de|&s;ign

to &s;teal, rob, commit murder, a rape, or &s;ome other felony: This is done by opening a window, coming down a chimney, picking a lock, removing a bolt, turning a button, or unlo&s;ing any other fa&s;tening, yea, by lifting up a latch, and ru&s;hing in upon knocking, or even entering at a door &s;et open by a &s;ervant or one of the family, joined in a con&s;piracy with the thief. Breaking up and entering either of the&s;e ways, into a dwelling-hou&s;e, or any adjoining part or parcel thereof, though not under the &s;ame roof, with an intention to commit either of the above felonies, whether that inten|tion be carried into execution or not, is burglary: And that this is indeed an offence of &s;o henious a nature, even where theft or robbery only is committed, as will ju&s;tify a community in puni&s;hing it with death, will appear with evidence from the following con&s;iderations.</P>
<P N="1">1. GOD him&s;elf has &s;et a peculiar brand of infamy and enormity upon theft. In various pa&s;&s;ages of &s;crip|tures it is ranked and coupled with robbery and mur|der, both which are allowed to be worthy of death. (See John x&punc; 10. Job xxiv.14. Jer. vii.9, &amp;c.) Now if common theft be a crime of &s;uch magnitude, what mu&s;t it be when accompanied with tho&s;e circum|&s;tances of aggravation which denominate it burglary; it is done in the night, and is one of tho&s;e works of darkne&s;s &s;o often &s;tigmatized by the apo&s;tle; in the dead of the night, when all the creation, except bea&s;ts of prey, are at re&s;t, and when man is di&s;armed by &s;leep, and utterly unable to defend him&s;elf, his family or property, from the violence of the midnight thief, who is '<HI>a &s;trong man armed,</HI>' and hid from every human eye and helping hand, under the cover of darkne&s;s, and like his father, the prince of darkne&s;s, '<HI>he goeth about &s;eeking whom</HI>' and who&s;e '<HI>he may devour.</HI>' What mi&s;chief in &s;uch a ca&s;e cannot be done? Who&s;e life or property can ever be &s;afe? Be&s;ides my hou&s;e is invaded by force; and why is a man's own hou&s;e called his ca&s;tle? Why is an abu&s;e offered to a man under his own roof deemed in law a di&s;tingui&s;hed offence? Cannot a door
<PB N="3" REF="019407_0036_0FABAB065DB03458">
be broken open, even by an officer, under the light of day, to execute a civil proce&s;s? Why not? It is be|cau&s;e the right of dome&s;tic peace and protection are &s;o dear and &s;acred to every man; and therefore the laws of nature and of the land,' have made an hedge about him, and about all that he hath, on every &s;ide,' and who but a madman can wi&s;h to &s;ee it broken down?&mdash; Again, con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="2">2. THAT other crimes, apparently le&s;s than bur|glary, have been, by the expre&s;s command of God, puni&s;hed with death. Under the Jewi&s;h law we find a large number, which, according to their different de|&s;erts, were puni&s;hed with different kinds of death; &s;ome criminals were &s;trangled, others burnt alive, &s;ome killed by the &s;word, and others &s;toned to death; their capital crimes amounted to more than thirty in num|ber, which probably &s;ounds large to tho&s;e who have had the ignorance and effrontery to affirm, that no crime mentioned in &s;cripture was ever made capital except murder. In this large number, however, we may particularly notice the following ones, viz. Adul|tery, ince&s;t, gluttony, with drunkenne&s;s, fal&s;e pro|phecy, &s;educing, &s;abbath-breaking, cur&s;ing and &s;trik|ing parents, &amp;c. Who will now a&s;&s;ert that not one of all the&s;e is a le&s;s crime than burglary? Was the &s;triking of a parent, perhaps in a &s;udden fit of pa&s;&s;ion, and be|fore rea&s;on had arrived to its full maturity and &s;trength, a greater offence in a child, who&s;e natural temper and ill-treatment might be a principal cau&s;e, than it is at this day for a man with deliberation and de&s;ign, to go and commit &s;uch a complicated crime as this? And did the all-wi&s;e God, '<HI>who&s;e compa&s;&s;ions fail not,</HI>' once enact a law that &s;hould take away the life of a child in the above ca&s;e, and yet may not '<HI>the powers that be' of God,</HI> do the &s;ame in another, when it appears nece&s;&s;ary to a State, and far more criminal? Certainly they may do it. Indeed it is already done, in the in&s;tances of robbery and a rape, both which are death, and that with|out objection or complaint that we hear: But neither of
<PB N="4" REF="019407_0037_0FABAB0A8D00FEA8">
the&s;e, in point of guilt and enormity, can equal that of hou&s;e-breaking. In ca&s;e of a rape the woman has power to cry for help, and may obtain it. In highway robbery, when the pi&s;tol is pre&s;ented to a man's brea&s;t, and his money is demanded, it may, perhaps, be in his hou&s;e, and not in his pocket, or if it is, delivering it up may &s;ave his life; yea, both may be &s;aved by a &s;ucce&s;s|ful attack upon the robber, or by a &s;udden flight from him; this is po&s;&s;ible, becau&s;e the man a&s;&s;aulted is on his hor&s;e, or upon his feet, but in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e he is in his bed and a&s;leep, with his family around him, all off their guard, ab&s;olutely unable to make the lea&s;t re|&s;i&s;tance, or even &s;o much as to &s;ound an alarm; the thief enters the hou&s;e&punc; and every life in it lies wholly at his mercy; &s;hould one of the family be rou&s;ed, that one perhaps a father, may in the terrors and darkne&s;s of night, kill the wife of his bo&s;om, or one of his own children; or the child, a father or brother, in&s;tead of the thief, who is after all in perfect &s;ecurity, and with the riche&s;t plunder in his hands&mdash;the hard earnings of a whole life, he is left to make his e&s;cape, under the cover of darkne&s;s, beyond the probability of ever being de|tected. Is this the crime which is thought le&s;s than robbery or a rape? If it is, let one probable &s;uppo&s;ition more be added to the above, and that is this, that the father of the family is awaked from &s;leep, by the mid|night cry of daughters ravi&s;hed in his own hou&s;e, a wife in a fright, and fainting by his &s;ide, &s;ons murder|ed, and weltering in their own gore, and his hou&s;e, his own ca&s;tle of defence, in flames about him, and the vil|lains who have done it all fled with impunity, and gone, irrecoverably gone, from the avenging arm of human ju&s;tice.&mdash;Ravi&s;hed daughters! women mu&s;t feel the blu&s;h ri&s;e in their faces, and re&s;entment in their hearts, when they think of tho&s;e thoughtle&s;s creatures of their own &s;ex, who have been extenuating burglary, and rai&s;ing an outcry again&s;t a law that guards at once the cha&s;ti|ty of daughters, and the doors of their hou&s;es, with death. A guard, not too &s;trong for female virtue,

again&s;t the brutal lu&s;ts of midnight ruffians, nor too great for the &s;ecurity of life and property at a time when the very dregs of a large di&s;banded army are emptied out upon us. Once more, we add</P>
<P N="3">3. That &s;tealing it&s;elf was, under certain circum|&s;tances, made a capital offence, when God him&s;elf was the legi&s;lator of his people. 'If a thief be found breaking up, and be &s;mitten that he die, there &s;hall be no blood &s;hed for him.' Exod. 22.2. This pa&s;&s;age was cited, on the occa&s;ion, both of the &s;entence, and ex|ecution of the criminal. The judge on the fir&s;t, and on the other, I referred to it, in vindication of both. It was however pronounced impertinent, and by &s;ome an impo&s;ition on the people. In an&s;wer, for my&s;elf, I &s;hall only &s;ay, that if quoting a text, is an impo&s;ition, unle&s;s it an&s;wers in every circum&s;tance, to the occa&s;ion on which it is adduced, then there is not in all the Bible, perhaps, a &s;ingle text, that can ever be u&s;ed on any occa&s;ion whatever. This pa&s;&s;age was not brought to prove that common theft, or even hou&s;e-breaking, was puni&s;hed with death by the judges of the Jewi&s;h State; but only that it was &s;o under certain circum&s;tances.&mdash; That is, if a thief was found in the night breaking up an hou&s;e, he might be killed upon the &s;pot, without lo&s;s of blood in him who &s;hould deal the deadly blow: and if this were only an act of &s;elf-defence, it will evi|dently &s;hew, not only the greatne&s;s of the crime, as this appears the only one in which voluntary man&s;laughter was tolerated among the Jews, but it &s;hews al&s;o, the weakne&s;s and futility of under&s;tanding the phra&s;e of breaking up, as &s;ome do, to mean the breaking up of a barn or &s;tall; was any one ever allowed by the Jewi&s;h law, or by any other, to kill a thief in his barn at night, in defence of his cattle? no, it mu&s;t, according to the text be in his own hou&s;e, and in defence of him&s;elf and family; and therefore we may fairly rea&s;on thus, and &s;ay, if a wi&s;e God, in character of a law-maker, once &s;aw fit, to put the fatal &s;word into the hands of a ma&s;ter, or member of a family for a common defence of that &s;mall
<PB N="6" REF="019407_0039_0FABAB0C5E994C38">
circle (in ca&s;e of burglary) why may not the &s;ame &s;word be committed to the hands of a civil magi&s;trate for the common &s;ecurity of a larger community? but children need a protector, as they are weak and helple&s;s; it is granted; and equally unable may the &s;tronge&s;t be, in a ca&s;e like this, to make a defence again&s;t the &s;uperior power of the aggre&s;&s;or. What good rea&s;on then can be given, why the law of a State &s;hould not come in to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the weaker party? and while it leaves him his natural right of killing the thief, if he can, ought it not at the &s;ame time, to protect and avenge him and his family, when he is wholly unable to do it him|&s;elf? Add to this, that if theft by hou&s;ebreaking in the night, was not a capital offence in the eye of the Jewi&s;h law, let any who can, make it appear, that it was in fact any crime, or had any puni&s;hment at all. In all the various kinds of theft, the puni&s;hment we &s;ee is very minutely &s;pecified, and even in this under con&s;idera|tion provided the &s;un was ri&s;en, full re&s;titution was by law required; but what was the puni&s;hment if in the night or before &s;un-ri&s;e? Death it was, or none at all that we can find in the law of Mo&s;es. Should this rea|&s;oning upon the text in que&s;tion be thought in&s;ufficient to prove that &s;tealing was in any ca&s;e puni&s;hed with death, I would mention another, again&s;t which there can be no objections: It is Exod. 21, 16, 'He that &s;tealeth a man, &s;hall &s;urely be put to death.' This is &s;tealing, and it was death by this &s;tatute, here made by God him&s;elf. Men and not goods were indeed, the &s;poils taken: This however is only a circum&s;tance, and le&s;s too, all things con&s;idered, than are &s;ome which at|tend that atrocious kind of theft, we call burglary, as might (were there room for it) ea&s;ily be &s;hown. The confe&s;&s;ion of the penitent thief on the cro&s;s, and the in|&s;tance of Achan, who for &s;tealing a wedge of gold and a Babyloni&s;h garment was &s;toned to death, with others to the like purpo&s;e, I omit; and, upon the whole, &s;ay, that if &s;tealing is a crime of &s;uch enormity in God's ac|count, as above de&s;cribed; if under certain circum|&s;tances,
<PB N="7" REF="019407_0040_0FABAB0D55AFECF8">
it has been, by his expre&s;s command, actually puni&s;hed with death; and la&s;tly, if other crimes, which in the true e&s;timation of things, are le&s;s criminal than burglary, have been treated in the &s;ame manner, then it mu&s;t follow, that a community has, and ought to have, an indi&s;putable right to puni&s;h it with the pains of death.</P>
<P>IT now remains, that we further confirm the point, by an&s;wering the objections which may be brought again&s;t it.</P>
<P N="1">1. IF hou&s;e-breaking is in fact &s;o heinous a crime, why was its puni&s;hment left to the &s;word of the injured party, and not like others of a capital nature, made 'an iniquity to be puni&s;hed by the judges?' The an|&s;wer is obvious: The body of the people in Mo&s;es's day, were &s;hepherds dwelling in tents. Their wealth con&s;i&s;ted chiefly in cattle, and not in &s;tores of goods, and co&s;tly furniture. Their habitations in common, were only a &s;ingle apartment, or lodging place on the ground, made of canvas, often moved from place to place, and into which, it was next to impo&s;&s;ible for one to enter in the night, without being di&s;covered. On which, and other accounts, neither the lives, dwel|lings, nor property of that people, could be, like ours, expo&s;ed to plunderers in the night, And after the&s;e tents were exchanged for hou&s;es, in the land of Canaan, even the&s;e were &s;o formed and furni&s;hed, in tho&s;e early times of plainne&s;s and &s;implicity, as did very much fru&s;trate the de&s;igns of hou&s;e-breakers. When Britain was invaded by Ce&s;ar, the hou&s;es, we are told, even in capital towns, were without chimneys, wattled and plai&s;tered over with clay, and all the furniture and uten&s;ils were of wood. The people &s;lept on &s;traw pallets, with a log of wood for a pillow. And in the infancy, or fir&s;t &s;ettlement of this, or any new country, when hou&s;es are made of logs, without windows, with|out partitions, and with but a &s;ingle door to enter, and no tempting trea&s;ure within; hou&s;e-breaking, in the&s;e circum&s;tances, required not &s;uch a penalty as it really
<PB N="8" REF="019407_0041_0FABAB0DF82BF588">
demands in the progre&s;s, or advanced age of the &s;ame country; where population and wealth, luxury and idlene&s;s, poverty and vice, have created innumerable temptations to the inhabitants. Agreeably to this, it ought to be known and remembered, that burglary was not, by law, even in the &s;econd in&s;tance of it, pu|ni&s;hable by death in this State, for a &s;pace of more than ninety years together: Branding and whipping an&s;wered the purpo&s;e until the year 1715, when the legi&s;lature, for good rea&s;ons, given in the preamble of the act, made it felony, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance. This at once &s;truck terror into hardy, determined offenders; and the con&s;equences was, from that day to the pre&s;ent time, our gallows have been rarely occupied, except by natives of foreign countries, or neighbouring States. And might I here hazard a conjecture, it &s;hould be this, that &s;ome even of tho&s;e, who are now the mo&s;t virulent in the oppo&s;ition, would, upon the adoption of their own plan, &s;oon clamour as loud in favour of more effectual puni&s;hments, as ever they have done again&s;t them; unle&s;s it &s;hould be a fact, which I hope it is not, that they are already in the number of crimi|nals, or el&s;e, by their pre&s;ent oppo&s;ition, they intend for them&s;elves a future licence.</P>
<P N="2">2. IT may be further objected, perhaps, that ina&s;|much as death is the greate&s;t puni&s;hment that ever can be inflicted on any offender, burglary and murder will lo&s;e their proper di&s;tinctions, and be treated as equals in criminality.</P>
<P>THIS objection is be&s;t an&s;wered by an appeal to the feelings of every man, upon once knowing that his hou&s;e is broken up in the night, and that a thief is within the walls of it, Who will venture unarmed to enter where he is? Who will ri&s;que his life upon this, that &s;uch an audacious felon has not entered the hou&s;e with a murderous, as well as thievi&s;h intention? Will the wretch, who is hardy enough to commit a crime, which he knows is death, ever he&s;itate to murder a man, under his own roof, to make an e&s;cape? I know
<PB N="9" REF="019407_0042_0FABAB0EB02CA828">
it is called cruel, and wide from all rea&s;on and propor|tion, to take away the life of one, who has taken away from another, only a few articles of his property. But is this all? Did a thief ever yet enter an hou&s;e without a de&s;ign of being concealed, at all adventures? And if &s;o then, he never entered without murder in his heart. This is, and ever ought to be the pre&s;umption. Upon this it evidently was, that an hou&s;e-breaker, under the Jewi&s;h law, might be killed in the night; for the &s;un being ri&s;en, the pre&s;umption was, that he came not to kill, but to &s;teal only, and therefore blood was upon <HI>his</HI> head who &s;hould &s;mite him. Call not then an hou&s;e-breaker, any more by the name of a thief, for it is by interpretation, a murderer. And though he may often have plundered in the night, without actual mur|der; yet this, for aught we know, was owing wholly to his being undi&s;covered and unmole&s;ted in his wick|edne&s;s. Rea&s;on therefore, and &s;cripture, will both &s;up|port me when I affirm, in &s;acred &s;tyle, that '<HI>the thief cometh not but for to &s;teal, to kill, and to de&s;troy.</HI>' Again,</P>
<P N="3">3. MAKING burglary a capital offence, or any other except murder, does without nece&s;&s;ity, and at once, defeat the main de&s;ign of puni&s;hment, and deprive the community of a life that might be u&s;eful to it. In an|&s;wer to this it &s;hould be ob&s;erved, that all the propo&s;ed ends of puni&s;hment, are reformation, re&s;titution, and terror to evil doers. The two fir&s;t of the&s;e, it is &s;aid, will be taken away and lo&s;t, with the life of the criminal; but this wants proof. And whoever well con&s;iders the nature and progre&s;s of tho&s;e vices, which u&s;ually end in the halter, with the catalogue of crimes which fill up confe&s;&s;ions from the gallows, will perhaps, en|tertain as high expectations of reformation in criminals, from the fir&s;t hour of their &s;entence, to the day of their execution, as in a number of &s;urviving years. In ge|neral, they are a number of incurables, except by an exploit of omnipotence; and therefore, life to them may be a cur&s;e, even greater if po&s;&s;ible than it is to &s;ociety; while the taking of it from them as a puni&s;h|ment,
<PB N="10" REF="019407_0043_0FABAB0F60301CC0">
will in reality, tend to di&s;courage and deter daring offenders more than any other.&mdash;This I know is denied by &s;ome; but the opinion of him, who once &s;aid, '<HI>&s;kin for &s;kin; yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life,</HI>' is perhaps, in this particular, prefer|able to theirs, who can believe, any puni&s;hment ever yet practi&s;ed in a chri&s;tian country, can in general, terrify and deter men equal to the pains of death. By all winch, however, I mean not to oppo&s;e, on the con|trary it is mo&s;t ardently wi&s;hed, that we had mines, to en&s;lave for life, or galleys, to chain up the mi&s;chievous hands of &s;uch ne&s;arious banditti; or, if po&s;&s;ible, that &s;ome other effectual puni&s;hments were provided by the State, at lea&s;t by way of experiment, in&s;tead of death, for &s;ome of our capital crimes. But until the&s;e are in|&s;tituted, and actually take its place, we &s;hall in&s;i&s;t upon it, though it is at the expence of hard names and bitter cen&s;ures, that '<HI>who&s;oever will &s;ave his life</HI>' in &s;uch ca&s;es, '<HI>&s;hall lo&s;e it</HI>' in the whole community; '<HI>and who&s;oever &s;hall de&s;troy life,</HI>' when forfeited, and full of deadly poi&s;on to &s;ociety, '<HI>&s;hall find it an hundred fold in this world.</HI>'&mdash;Yet may heaven forbid that govern|ment, after all, &s;hould ever depend upon &s;evere puni&s;h|ments alone to prevent the commi&s;&s;ion of crimes. Un|le&s;s '<HI>the ax be laid at the root</HI>' of the evil, by proper methods of re&s;training idlene&s;s and luxury, and a due care to educate the members of a community, to the love of virtue and indu&s;try, and an abhorrence of every thing ba&s;e and di&s;hone&s;t, in vain are even capital pu|ni&s;hments. The wages of &s;in may be death, but alone it will not avail to &s;tem the torrent, and &s;ecure the peace and happine&s;s of &s;ociety.</P>
<P N="4">4. THAT objection, of all others, which by &s;ome is thought to have the greate&s;t weight, but in reality has the lea&s;t of all, is taken from our Saviour's words to the woman, taken in adultery (John 8.) This woman was, by the Scribes and Phari&s;ees brought to Je&s;us, and indicted before him, for a crime that was death by the law of Mo&s;es. In this ca&s;e they a&s;ked his opinion,
<PB N="11" REF="019407_0044_0FABAB10435CE6A0">
with a de&s;ign, if po&s;&s;ible, to en&s;nare him; i. e. if he &s;aid &s;he ought to die, they intended to have accu&s;ed him to the Roman governor, for tolerating the Jews, in the exerci&s;e of a judicial power. But if he had ac|quitted her, they would repre&s;ent him an enemy to the law of Mo&s;es, Knowing their de&s;ign, he at fir&s;t waves an an&s;wer: But when they in&s;i&s;ted upon it, he replies, 'let him that is without &s;in ca&s;t the fir&s;t &s;tone.' This at once, fixed upon their con&s;ciences &s;uch painful con|victions, that they immediately left him and the wo|man alone; to whom he &s;aid, 'hath no man con|demned thee?' &s;he &s;aid no man, Lord: Je&s;us replies, 'neither do I condemn thee; go and &s;in no more.' Thus their &s;nare was broken; and not the penalty of Mo&s;es's law, in the ca&s;e of adultery, taken away, as &s;ome have &s;trangely inferred from this pa&s;&s;age. 'Chri&s;t came not to de&s;troy the law, but to fulfil all righteou&s;|ne&s;s.' He never once &s;et him&s;elf up 'as a judge or divider,' in civil affairs; on the contrary he was an e|minent pattern of obedience and &s;ubjection to govern|ment, 'rendering unto Ce&s;ar the things that were Ce|&s;ars;' and finally he left it with his Apo&s;tles, to enjoin on all chri&s;tian princes and rulers, that &s;ufficient laws be made, 'for the lawle&s;s and di&s;obedient, for murder|ers, lyars, whoremongers, for them that defile them|&s;elves with mankind, and for&mdash;<HI>men-&s;tealers,</HI>' &amp;c. from which it is evident, that the ancient Jewi&s;h law again&s;t theft is here expre&s;ly ratified by the Apo&s;tle, &s;ee 1 Tim. 1, 10. Exod. 21, 16. Once more, and</P>

IN oppo&s;ition to the above rea&s;oning, it will un|doubtedly be &s;aid, and well it may, by men of &s;en&s;e and reflection, 'to what purpo&s;e is all this wa&s;te' of time and pains in proof of that, which needs none at all. This is the objection, and I hone&s;tly confe&s;s I am not able to an&s;wer it. Let him do it who can; for is it po&s;&s;ible to &s;uppo&s;e, that a body of judicial laws, though made in heaven, for a people who exi&s;ted &s;ome thou|&s;and years ago, and &s;o different from us in their man|ners, connexions, pur&s;uits, &s;ituation, &s;oil, climate,

and an endle&s;s variety of other circum&s;tances, can, or ever ought, in equity, and in particular, to bind us, or any other nation on earth, at this day. Such laws mu&s;t exceed even the power of omnipotence it&s;elf, as much as any contradiction, or act of inju&s;tice, that can be named. Many u&s;eful in&s;tructions indeed, to all legi&s;lators, of every country on the globe, may and ought to be borrowed from thence, as they came from a God infinitely wi&s;e: Yet, con&s;idered merely as <HI>Jewi&s;h,</HI> they are, perhaps, no more to us, than tho&s;e of any other wi&s;e nation. Should it therefore &s;till be urged, that becau&s;e neither burglary, ar&s;on, robbery, nor rape, were death by the Jewi&s;h law, they in fact, ought not to be &s;o by ours, I have equal right in my turn, to in&s;i&s;t upon it, that the lo&s;s of virginity before marriage, the &s;triking of parents, and &s;abbath-breaking, &s;hall by our laws, al&s;o be puni&s;hed with death.&mdash;The exact truth after all is this; the wi&s;dom of God, has left the power of legi&s;lation, in the particular circum&s;tances of it, to the wi&s;dom of moral agents, in every region un|der heaven; and therefore, upon the virtue and good &s;en&s;e of this county, we mu&s;t and &s;hall rely, in future; &s;o far at lea&s;t, as to pre&s;ume, that not one among all, will ever again open his mouth, to cur&s;e or revile the rulers of his own choice, while in the hone&s;t, but pain|ful execution of a law, a righteous law of our own enacting; and in the open, hazardous defence of our own lives, peace, and property.</P>

<HEAD>A SKETCH of JOHN DIXSON's Life.</HEAD>
<P>THE principal account, we can at pre&s;ent give of this unfortunate young man, is that which was taken from his own mouth, while in pri&s;on: And as he was utterly aver&s;e from &s;uch confe&s;&s;ions as have been u&s;ually made under &s;uch circum&s;tances, his hi&s;tory will be &s;hort.&mdash;He was born, as he con&s;tantly af|firmed, at Ea&s;t-Haddam, in Connecticut: His father
<PB N="13" REF="019407_0046_0FABAB11ABAD51F8">
died when he was young, and under the care of his mother, he was early in life &s;ent to &s;chool, where he &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf for mi&s;chievous behaviour. When grown up, he entered contrary to the inclination of his parent, on board a ve&s;&s;el bound to France: His villainous conduct in this voyage, procured for him a &s;evere cha&s;ti&s;ement from his captain; which he re|turned upon his own head, the fir&s;t opportunity he found on &s;hore. After this, he enli&s;ted into the Ame|rican army, and took a bounty, but &s;oon de&s;erted, and again enli&s;ted, and thus went on until the number of his enli&s;tments, with bounties, amounted to eighteen times: For which he received proper puni&s;hments as often as detected; but to no effect. He made &s;everal rambles through different parts of the country, in which he improved every opportunity 'to fill up the mea&s;ure of his iniquity.' He frequently broke open hou&s;es and &s;tores, and &s;tole goods, provi&s;ions, money, cloathing, and even cattle, to a very con&s;iderable amount: All which, in a very &s;hort time, he con&s;umed upon his lu&s;ts, at taverns, in grog-&s;hops, and over the gameing-table. From a &s;hoe-maker's &s;hop he once &s;tole a pair of &s;hoes; and being immediately di&s;covered, he, to &s;ave his back from &s;tripes, begged, and pro|mi&s;ed to labour faithfully, until he had made full &s;a|tisfaction: The owner finally con&s;ented; and employed him to drive his team: But he ungratefully &s;eized the very fir&s;t opportunity, and drove the oxen to a river, &s;wam them over, then &s;old them, took the money, and went off. For theft he was once committed to Wor|ce&s;ter gaol, and there loaded with irons, &s;trongly fa&s;|tened about his neck, which he &s;oon broke, as well as the pri&s;on, and fled. He al&s;o broke from Windham gaol, in Connecticut, to which he had been confined for &s;tealing again. 'His mouth was full of cur&s;ing' and &s;wearing, of oaths and bla&s;phemies of the mo&s;t horrible &s;ound, that his imagination could invent. He &s;hewed no regard to the holy &s;abbath; rarely ever read the &s;criptures, or attended public wor&s;hip, and never
<PB N="14" REF="019407_0047_0FABAB1268124918">
gave any attention to the word preached when pre&s;ent. He was once accu&s;ed of committing a rape; and it is perhaps now beyond a doubt, that while in the army, and for repeated de&s;ertions, enli&s;tments, taking boun|ties, and changing his name, this very man was there &s;entenced to death, and actually brought under the gallows for execution; but for rea&s;ons unknown, he was pardoned, and returned to his regiment, where he &s;tole an hor&s;e, in a few hours after, from an officer, and rode off. But the fatal crime, which ended at once his life and licentious career, was burglary, committed at the hou&s;e of Capt. James Dagget, of Rehoboth. The evidence upon which he was apprehended, tried, and condemned, was &s;o full and convincing, as left in the mind &s;carcely a remaining doubt. The bare-faced impudence 'of his own iniquity found him out,' '<HI>&s;in taking occa&s;ion from</HI>' thence, '<HI>deceived him and &s;lew him.</HI>' Before he received the &s;entence of death, he was in pri&s;on jovial, di&s;&s;olute, and prophane; but afterwards he appeared, at times, full of anxiety and remor&s;e.&mdash; His attention and behaviour, the la&s;t times he attended public wor&s;hip, were very &s;erious. In a &s;hort &s;peech made at the gallows, he warned others, by him&s;elf, again&s;t drinking, gameing, and evil company: He then expre&s;&s;ed his thanks to the &s;heriff, and to all of whom he had received kindne&s;&s;es, while in pri&s;on; and as &s;oon as the appointed moment of his execution ar|rived, he leaped into the cart, a&s;&s;i&s;ted in adju&s;ting the rope about his own neck, and even in turning him&s;elf off, with an appearance of fortitude, which &s;urprized every &s;pectator; but this, whether from principles of infidelity, &s;tupefaction, or chri&s;tianity, we dare not pronounce.</P>
