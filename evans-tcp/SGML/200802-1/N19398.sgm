<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE favourable reception given to the imper|fect account of the fever which I lately pub|li&s;hed, and the particular de&s;ire of &s;ome of my friends, have induced me to undertake a more &s;atisfactory hi&s;tory of it, in order to collect together, while facts are recent, as many of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting occurrences as I could, for the information of the public.</P>
<P>I have not attempted any embelli&s;hment or ornament of &s;tile; but have alone aimed at tel|ling plain truths in plain language. For the de|&s;ultory plan of &s;ome part of the pamphlet, I have to offer the following apology; many of the circum&s;tances and reflexions towards the conclu|&s;ion, which would have come with more pro|priety in the beginning, did not occur, until &s;ome of the fir&s;t half &s;heets were not only writ|ten, but printed. I had no choice, therefore,
<PB N="8" REF="025255_0004_0FCCD937857F4D88">
but either to omit them, or place them &s;ome|what out of order.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the facts mentioned have fallen un|der my own ob&s;ervation. Tho&s;e of a different de&s;cription I have been a&s;&s;iduous to collect from every per&s;on of credibility, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of infor|mation.</P>
<P>De&s;irous of having this account correct and complete, I have printed off but a &s;mall num|ber of copies of the pre&s;ent edition: and &s;hall e&s;teem my&s;elf mo&s;t particularly obliged to any per&s;on who will be &s;o kind to point out errors, to be corrected in, or &s;ugge&s;t facts, to be added to, a new edition, which I propo&s;e to put to pre&s;s very &s;oon, and which will, I hope, be found &s;till more ample than the pre&s;ent one.</P>

<HEAD>A BRIEF ACCOUNT, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE I enter on the con&s;ideration of this di&s;order, it may not be improper to offer a few introductory remarks on the &s;ituation of Philadelphia previous to its commencement, which will reflect light on &s;ome of the circum|&s;tances mentioned in the cour&s;e of the narra|tive.</P>
<P>The manufactures, trade, and commerce of Philadelphia had, for a con&s;iderable time, been improving and extending with great rapidity. From the period of the adoption of the federal government, at which time we were at the low|e&s;t ebb of di&s;tre&s;s, our &s;ituation had progre&s;|&s;ively become more and more pro&s;perous. Con|fidence, formerly bani&s;hed, was univer&s;ally re|&s;tored. Property of every kind, ro&s;e to, and in
<PB N="10" REF="025255_0006_0FCCED4328BC1DA8">
&s;ome in&s;tances beyond, its real value&punc; and a few revolving years exhibited the intere&s;ting &s;pectacle of a young country, with a new form of government, emerging from a &s;tate approach|ing very near to anarchy, and acquiring all the &s;tability and nerve of the be&s;t-toned and olde&s;t nations.</P>
<P>In this pro&s;perity, which revived the hopes of four millions of people, Philadelphia participa|ted in an eminent degree. New hou&s;es, in al|mo&s;t every &s;treet, built in a very neat, elegant &s;tile, adorned, at the &s;ame time that they en|larged the city. Its population was extending fa&s;t. Hou&s;e rent had ri&s;en to a mo&s;t extravagant height; it was in many ca&s;es double, and in &s;ome treble what it had been a year or two be|fore; and, as is generally the ca&s;e, when a city is thriving, it went far beyond the real increa&s;e of trade. The number of applicants for hou&s;es, exceeding the number of hou&s;es to be let, one bid over another; and affairs were in &s;uch a &s;itua|tion, that many people, though they had a tole|rable run of bu&s;ine&s;s, could hardly do more than clear their rents, and were, literally, toiling for
<PB N="11" REF="025255_0007_0FCCED45084A8730">
their landlords alone<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The di&s;tre&s;s ari&s;ing from this &s;oure, was perhaps the only exception to the general ob&s;ervation of the flouri&s;h|ing &s;ituation of Philadelphia.</NOTE>. Luxury, the u&s;ual, and perhaps inevitable concomitant of pro&s;perity, was gaining ground in a manner very alarming to tho&s;e who con&s;idered how far the virtue, the liberty, and the happine&s;s of a nation depend on their temperance and &s;ober manners. Men had been for &s;ome time in the habit of regulating their expen&s;es by pro&s;pects formed in &s;anguine hours, when every probability was caught at as a certainty, not by their actual profits, or in|come. The number of coaches, coachees, chairs, &amp;c. lately &s;et up by men in the middle rank of life, is hardly credible. And although there had been a very great increa&s;e of hackney chairs, yet it was hardly ever po&s;&s;ible to procure one on a Sunday, unle&s;s it was engaged two or three days before. Extravagance, in various &s;hapes, was gradually eradicating the plain and whole|&s;ome habits of the city. And although it were pre&s;umption to attempt to &s;can the decrees of heaven, yet few, I believe, will pretend to deny,
<PB N="12" REF="025255_0008_0FCCED46E62044E8">
that &s;omething was wanting to humble the pride of a city, which was running on in full ca|reer, to the goal of prodigality and di&s;&s;ipation.</P>
<P>However, from November 1792, to the end of la&s;t June, the difficulties of Philadelphia were extreme. The e&s;tabli&s;hment of the bank of Penn&s;ylvania, in embryo for the mo&s;t part of that time, had arre&s;ted in the other banks &s;uch a quantity of the circulating &s;pecie, as embarra&s;|&s;ed almo&s;t every kind of bu&s;ine&s;s; to this was added the di&s;tre&s;s ari&s;ing from the very nume|rous failures in England, which had extremely harra&s;&s;ed &s;everal of our capital merchants. Dur|ing this period, many men experienced as great difficulties as were ever known in this city<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">It is with great plea&s;ure, I embrace this opportunity of declaring, that the very liberal conduct of the bank of the united &s;tates, at this trying &s;ea&s;on, was the means of &s;aving many a de&s;erving and indu&s;trious man from ruin.</NOTE>. But the opening, in July, of the bank of Penn|&s;ylvania, conducted on the mo&s;t liberal princi|ples, placed bu&s;ine&s;s on its former favourable
<PB N="13" REF="025255_0009_0FCCED4B7ABDC3F8">
footing. Every man looked forward to this fall as likely to produce a va&s;t exten&s;ion of trade. But how fleeting are all human views! how un|certain all plans founded on earthly appearan|ces! All the&s;e flattering pro&s;pects vani&s;hed like the ba&s;ele&s;s fabric of a vi&s;ion.</P>
<P>In July, arrived the unfortunate fugitives from Cape Fran&ccedil;ois. And on this occa&s;ion, the liberality of Philadelphia was di&s;played in a mo&s;t re&s;pectable point of light. Nearly 12,000 dol|lars were in a few days collected for their relief. Little, alas! did many of the contributors, then in ea&s;y circum&s;tances, imagine, that a few weeks would leave their wives and children dependent on the public charity, as has &s;ince unfortunate|ly happened. An awful in&s;tance of the rapid and warning vici&s;&s;itudes of affairs on this tran|&s;itory &s;tage.</P>
<P>At this time, the de&s;troying &s;courge crept in among us, and nipped in the bud the faire&s;t blo&s;&s;oms that imagination could form. And, oh! what dreadful contra&s;t has &s;ince taken place! Many of our fir&s;t commercial hou&s;es are totally di&s;&s;olved, by the death of the parties,
<PB N="14" REF="025255_0010_0FCCED4D0B6ABEA8">
and their affairs are nece&s;&s;arily left in &s;o derang|ed a &s;tate that the lo&s;&s;es and di&s;tre&s;&s;es which mu&s;t take place, are beyond e&s;timation. The prote&s;ts of notes for a few weeks pa&s;t, have been beyond all former example; for mo&s;t of the principal merchants having left the city, and been totally unable, from the &s;tagnation of bu&s;i|ne&s;s, and diver&s;ion of all their expected re&s;ources, to make any provi&s;ion for payment, many of their notes have been prote&s;ted, as they became due. The bank of the united &s;tates, pa&s;&s;ed, on the 15th of October, a re&s;olve, empowering their ca&s;hier to renew all di&s;counted notes, when the &s;ame drawers and indor&s;ers were of|fered, and declaring that no notes &s;hould be prote&s;ted, when the indor&s;ers bound them&s;elves in writing, to be acountable in the &s;ame man|ner as in ca&s;es of prote&s;t.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides what we have already &s;uffered, we are menaced with another evil, which proba|bly at any other period, would not very mate|rially injure the city; but if it comes in addition to our pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s, will operate again&s;t us a very long time. I mean the removal of congre&s;s. The meeting of this body is fixed for the fir&s;t
<PB N="15" REF="025255_0011_0FCCED4E5B747910">
Monday in December; and it is not improba|ble that attempts will be made to prevent their next &s;e&s;&s;ion being held here. Appeals will be made to their fears. Already the New York pa|pers announce,
<Q>that as congre&s;s cannot meet, agreeably to their adjournment, with any probability of &s;afety in Philadelphia, under its pre&s;ent calamitous vi&s;itation, there can be no doubt of their adjourning to &s;it in New York, where the air is perfectly &s;alubrious, the markets plentiful, and every conveniency ready for their accommodation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Columbian Gazetteer, October 17, 1793.</NOTE>.</Q>
If, at the time of their meeting, any trace of the di&s;order remains, the Philadelphians will not urge their &s;tay here. But if it be, as there is every probability, ab&s;olutely extingui&s;hed, we place too much reliance on their ju&s;tice to &s;u&s;pect that they will add to the &s;troke we have felt.</P>
<P>For the&s;e prefatory ob&s;ervations I hope I &s;hall be pardoned. I now proceed to the melancholy &s;ubject I have undertaken.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="025255_0012_0FCCED4FE5E8BA28">The malignant fever, which has committed &s;uch ravages in Philadelphia, made its appear|ance here, about the end of July. Dr. Hodge's child, probably the fir&s;t victim, was taken ill on the 26th or 27th of July, and died on the 6th or 7th of Augu&s;t. A Mr. Moore<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This man had been walking along the wharves, where the coffee lay, and at which the Sans Culottes was moored, in the morning; and on his return home, was &s;o extremely ill, as to be obliged to go to bed, from which he never ro&s;e again.</NOTE>, in Mr. Denny's lodging hou&s;e, in Water &s;treet, was &s;eized on Friday, the 2d of Augu&s;t, and died on Sunday, the fourth. Mrs. Parkin&s;on, who lodged in the &s;ame hou&s;e, caught the di&s;order, on the 3d of Augu&s;t, and died on the 7th.</P>
<P>On the origin of the di&s;order, there prevails a very great diver&s;ity of opinion. Dr. Hutchin|&s;on maintained that it was not imported, and &s;tated, in a letter which he wrote on the &s;ub|ject to Captain Falconer, the health officer of the port of Philadelphia, that
<Q>the general opinion was, that the di&s;order originated from &s;ome damaged coffee, or other putrified vegeta|ble and animal matters.</Q>
To this opinion,
<PB N="17" REF="025255_0013_0FCCED52C8F7FD70">
though he did not give it ab&s;olutely as his own, he &s;eemed &s;trongly to incline; and mentioned, that at a wharf, a little above Arch-&s;treet, there was not only a quantity of damaged cof|fee<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;tench of this coffee was &s;o exce&s;&s;ively offen&s;ive, that the people in the neighbourhood could hardly bear to remain in the back part of their hou&s;es.</NOTE>, extremely offen&s;ive, but al&s;o &s;ome putrid animal and vegetable &s;ub&s;tances. The doctor re&s;ted his opinion, that the di&s;order was not imported, on two circum&s;tances, which prove to be mi&s;taken, viz. that no foreigners or &s;ailors were infected on the 27th of Augu&s;t, the time of writing, and that it had not been found in lodging hou&s;es. This opinion was &s;o far from being ju&s;t, that the &s;econd place in which it is known to have made its appearance, was a lodg|ing hou&s;e, and &s;ome of the earlie&s;t patients were French lads.</P>
<P>Dr. Ru&s;h is of the &s;ame opinion with dr. Hut|chin&s;on, and &s;ays he has in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;ufficient documents to prove that the di&s;order is not an imported one, but of native growth. As he has
<PB N="18" REF="025255_0014_0FCCED53A136AF80">
not yet communicated his proofs to the public, it is impo&s;&s;ible to decide on them.</P>
<P>That it is an imported di&s;order, is the opini|on of mo&s;t of the inhabitants of Philadelphia. However, there is much diver&s;ity of &s;entiment, as to the time and manner of its introduction. I &s;hall &s;tate &s;ome of the various reports current, and let the reader judge for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Some a&s;&s;ert, that it was brought by Il Con&s;tante, commanded by Coulon, which ar|rived here from Ragu&s;a, and Martinico, about the beginning of May. This is very unlikely, as the lower part of the city, where &s;he lay, was free until the di&s;order &s;pread there from the up|per part.</P>
<P>Another opinion is, that it was introduced by the Mary, captain Ru&s;h, which arrived here on the 7th of Augu&s;t, with &s;ome of the French emigrants from the cape. But the exi&s;tence of the di&s;order previous to her arrival, &s;ets a&s;ide this opinion at once.</P>
<P>Others again &s;ay that a ve&s;&s;el from Tobago&punc;
<PB N="19" REF="025255_0015_0FCCED552AB00E08">
which arrived here in July, lo&s;t nearly all her hands with a malignant fever. In the river, &s;he &s;hipped fre&s;h hands, many of whom died. From her they believe the di&s;order &s;pread. With re|&s;pect to this report, I cannot aver any thing.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t probable and general opinion is, that the privateer Sans Culottes, with her prize, the Flora, which arrived here the 22d of July, intro|duced the fever. The privateer was in a foul, dirty condition&mdash;her hold very &s;mall&mdash;and perhaps as ill calculated for the accommodation of the great number of people that were on board, as any ve&s;&s;el that ever cro&s;&s;ed the ocean. All her &s;ilth was emptied at a wharf between Arch and Race-&s;treet. A dead body, &s;ewed up in canva&s;s, lay on board the Flora, for &s;ome time, and was &s;een by mr. Lemaigre and other gentlemen. Several re&s;pec|table inhabitants of Water-&s;treet declare, that &s;undry dead bodies were privately landed in the night, from the privateer and her prize.</P>
<P>Before I di&s;mi&s;s this part of the &s;ubject, it may not be ami&s;s to mention, that many believe we have had two di&s;orders in the city, introdu|ced about the &s;ame time, the yellow fever, from
<PB N="20" REF="025255_0016_0FCCED56DC534820">
the We&s;t Indies, and a &s;pecies of pe&s;tilence from Mar&s;eilles.</P>
<P>The mortality began about that part of Wa|ter-&s;treet, where the Sans Culottes lay. For &s;ome time it was entirely confined to that place and its neighbourhood. Almo&s;t every death which occurred in the early &s;tage of the di&s;order could be without difficulty traced to that &s;treet. By degrees, it &s;pread, owing to the want of precaution, and to communication with the infected. It is &s;aid, and generally be|lieved, that the beds and bedding of tho&s;e who died of the di&s;order, at fir&s;t, before the alarm went abroad, were &s;old, and &s;pread it among the buyers.</P>
<P>Several per&s;ons were &s;wept away before any great alarm was excited. The fir&s;t deaths that attracted public notice, and &s;truck terror among the citizens, were tho&s;e of Peter A&s;ton, on the 19th, of Mrs. Lemaigre, on the 20th, and of Thomas Miller, on the 25th of Augu&s;t. About this time began the removals from the city, which were for &s;ome weeks &s;o general, that al|mo&s;t every hour in the day, carts, waggons,
<PB N="21" REF="025255_0017_0FCCED583B5C1F08">
coachees, and chairs, were to be &s;een tran&s;port|ing families and furniture to the country in every direction. Bu&s;ine&s;s then became extreme|ly dull. Mechanics and arti&s;ts were unemployed; and the &s;treets wore the appearance of gloom and melancholy.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t official notice taken of the di&s;order, was on the 22d of Augu&s;t, on which day, the mayor of Philadelphia, Matthew Clark&s;on, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;q. wrote to the city commi&s;&s;ioners, and after ac|quainting them with the &s;tate of the city, gave them the mo&s;t peremptory orders, to have the &s;treets properly clean&s;ed and purified by the &s;cavengers, and all the filth immedi|ately hawled away. The&s;e orders were re|peated on the 27th, and &s;imilar ones given to the clerks of the market. The 29th the gover|nor of the &s;tate, in his addre&s;s to the legi&s;lature, acquainted them, that a contagious di&s;order exi&s;ted in the city; and that he had taken every proper mea&s;ure to a&s;certain the origin, nature, and extent of it. He likewi&s;e a&s;&s;ured them that the health officer and phy&s;ician of the port, would take every precaution to allay and re|move the public inquietude.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="025255_0018_0FCCED5998767B50">The 26th of the &s;ame month, the college of phy&s;icians had a meeting, at which they took into con&s;ideration the nature of the di&s;order, and the means of prevention and of cure. They publi&s;hed an addre&s;s to the citizens, &s;ign|ed by the pre&s;ident and &s;ecretary, recommend|ing to avoid all unnece&s;&s;ary intercour&s;e with the infected; to place marks on the doors or win|dows where they were; to pay great attention to cleanline&s;s and airing the rooms of the &s;ick; to provide a large and airy ho&s;pital in the neighbourhood of the city for their reception; to put a &s;top to the tolling of the bells; to bury tho&s;e who died of the di&s;order in carriages and as privately as po&s;&s;ible; to keep the &s;treets and wharves clean; to avoid all fatigue of body and mind, and &s;tanding or &s;itting in the &s;un, or in the open air; to accommodate the dre&s;s to the weather, and to exceed rather in warm than in cool clothing; and to avoid intemperance, but to u&s;e fermented liquors, &s;uch as wine, beer, and cider, with moderation. They likewi&s;e de|clared their opinion, that fires in the &s;treets were very dangerous, if not ineffectual means of &s;topping the progre&s;s of the fever, and that they placed more dependence on the burning of
<PB N="23" REF="025255_0019_0FCCED5D514C63F8">
gunpowder. The benefits of vinegar and cam|phor, they added, were confined chiefly to in|fected rooms, and could not be too often u&s;ed on handkerchiefs, or in &s;melling bottles, by per&s;ons who attended the &s;ick.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this addre&s;s, the bells were immediately &s;topped from tolling, which was a mea&s;ure very expedient; as they had before been kept pretty con&s;tantly going the whole day, &s;o as to terrify tho&s;e in health, and drive the &s;ick, as far as the influence of imagination could produce that effect, to their graves. An idea had gone abroad, that the burning of fires in the &s;treets, would have a tendency to purify the air, and arre&s;t the progre&s;s of the di&s;order. The people had, therefore, almo&s;t every night large fires lighted at the corners of the &s;treets. The 29th, the mayor publi&s;hed a proclamation, forbidding this practice. As a &s;ub&s;titute, many had recour&s;e to the firing of guns, which they imagined was a certain preventative of the di&s;|order. This was carried &s;o far, and attended with &s;uch danger, that it was forbidden by the mayor's order, of the 4th of September.</P>
<P>The number of the infected daily increa&s;ing,
<PB N="24" REF="025255_0020_0FCCED5EEFAD0460">
and the exi&s;tence of an order again&s;t the admi&s;|&s;ion of per&s;ons labouring under infectious di&s;|ea&s;es into the alms hou&s;e, precluding them from a refuge there<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At this period, the number of paupers in the alms hou&s;e was between three and four hundred; and the ma|nagers, apprehen&s;ive of &s;preading the di&s;order among them, enforced the abovementioned order, which had been entered into along time before. They, however, &s;up|plied beds and bedding, and all the money in their trea|&s;ury, for their relief, out of that hou&s;e.</NOTE>, &s;ome temporary place was re|qui&s;ite, and thre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the guardians of the poor took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the circus, in which mr. Ric|ketts had lately exhibited his eque&s;trian feats, being the only place that could be procured for the purpo&s;e. Thither they &s;ent &s;even per&s;ons afflicted with the malignant fever, where they lay in the open air for &s;ome time, and without proper a&s;&s;i&s;tance<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">High wages were offered for nur&s;es for the&s;e poor people&mdash;but none could be procured.</NOTE>. Of the&s;e, one crawled out on the commons, where he died at a di&s;tance from any hou&s;e. Two died in the circus, one of whom was &s;ea&s;onably removed; the other lay in a &s;tate of putrefaction for above forty eight hours, owing to the difficulty of procuring any per&s;on
<PB N="25" REF="025255_0021_0FCCED60618377C0">
to remove him. On this occa&s;ion occurred an in&s;tance of courage in a &s;ervant girl, of which at that time few men were capable. The carter, who finally undertook to remove the corp&s;e, having no a&s;&s;i&s;tant, and being unable alone to put it into the coffin, was on the point of relin|qui&s;hing his de&s;ign, and quitting the place. The girl perceived him, and under&s;tanding the dif|ficulty he laboured under, offered her &s;ervices, provided he would not inform the family with whom &s;he lived. She accordingly helped him to put the body into the coffin, which was by that time crawling with maggots, and in &s;uch a &s;tate as to be ready to fall in pieces. It gives me plea|&s;ure to add, that &s;he &s;till lives, notwith&s;tanding her very hazardous exploit.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of the neighbourhood of the circus took the alarm, and theatened to burn or de&s;troy it, unle&s;s the &s;ick were removed; and it is believed they would have actually carried their threats into execution, had a compliance been delayed a day longer.</P>
<P>The 29th, &s;even of the guardians of the poor had a conference with &s;ome of the city magi&s;|trates
<PB N="26" REF="025255_0022_0FCCED620BB5E108">
on the &s;ubject of the fever, at which it was agreed to be indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary that a &s;uitable hou&s;e, as an ho&s;pital, &s;hould be provided near the city for the reception of the infected poor.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence, the &s;ame day, the guardians of the poor re&s;olved to u&s;e their utmo&s;t exer|tions to procure &s;uch a hou&s;e out of town, and as near thereto, as might be practicable, con&s;i&s;t|ent with the &s;afety of the inhabitants, for the poor who were or might be afflicted with conta|gious di&s;orders, and be de&s;titute of the means of providing nece&s;&s;ary a&s;&s;i&s;tance otherwi&s;e; to en|gage phy&s;icians, nur&s;es, attendants, and all ne|ce&s;&s;aries for their relief in that hou&s;e; to ap|point proper per&s;ons in each di&s;trict, to enquire after &s;uch poor as might be afflicted; to admini&s;|ter a&s;&s;i&s;tance to them in their own hou&s;es, and, if nece&s;&s;ary, to remove them to the ho&s;pital. They re&s;erved to them&s;elves, at the &s;ame time, the liberty of calling on the mayor for &s;uch &s;ums as might be nece&s;&s;ary to carry their re|&s;olves into effect.</P>
<P>Conformably to the&s;e re&s;olves, a committee of
<PB N="27" REF="025255_0023_0FCCED6370BFA510">
the guardians was appointed to make enquiry for a &s;uitable place; and after &s;trict examina|tion, they judged that a building adjacent to Bu&s;hhill, the man&s;ion hou&s;e of William Hamil|ton, e&s;q. was the be&s;t calculated for the pur|po&s;e. And that gentleman being ab&s;ent, and having no agent in the city, and the great ur|gency of the ca&s;e admitting no delay, eight of the guardians, accompanied by Hilary Baker, e&s;q. one of the city aldermen, with the concur|rence of the governor, proceeded to the build|ing they had fixed upon; and meeting with &s;ome oppo&s;ition from a tenant who occupied it, they took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the man&s;ion hou&s;e it&s;elf, to which, on the &s;ame evening, the 31&s;t of Au|gu&s;t, they &s;ent the four patients who remained at the circus.</P>
<P>Shortly after this, the guardians of the poor for the city, except James Wil&s;on, Jacob Tom|kins, jun. and William San&s;om, cea&s;ed the performance of their duties, nearly the whole of them having removed out of the city. Before this virtual vacation of office, they pa&s;&s;ed a re|&s;olve again&s;t the admi&s;&s;ion of any paupers what|ever into the alms-hou&s;e during the prevalence
<PB N="28" REF="025255_0024_0FCCED64DF528630">
of the di&s;order. The cau&s;e of entering into this order, was, that &s;ome paupers, who had been admitted previous thereto, with a certificate from the phy&s;icians, of their being free from the infection, had neverthele&s;s died of it. The whole care of the poor of the city, the providing for Bu&s;h-hill, &s;ending the &s;ick there, and burying the dead, devolved, therefore, on the above three guardians. It mu&s;t give the reader great &s;orrow to hear, that two of them, James Wil|&s;on, and Jacob Tomkins, excellent and indefati|gable young men, who&s;e &s;ervices were at that time of very great importance, fell &s;acrifices in the cau&s;e of humanity. The other, William San|&s;om, was likewi&s;e, in the execution of his dange|rous office, &s;eized with the di&s;order, and on the brink of the grave, but was &s;o fortunate as to e&s;cape.</P>
<P>The con&s;ternation of the people of Philadel|phia at this period was carried beyond all bounds. Di&s;may and affright were vi&s;ible in the countenance of almo&s;t every per&s;on. Mo&s;t peo|ple who could by any means make it convenient, fled from the city. Of tho&s;e who remained, ma|ny &s;hut them&s;elves up in their hou&s;es, and were
<PB N="29" REF="025255_0025_0FCCED66642259D8">
afraid to walk the &s;treets. The con&s;umption of gunpowder and nitre in hou&s;es as a preventa|tive, was inconceivable. Many were almo&s;t in|ce&s;&s;antly purifying, &s;cowering, and whitewa&s;h|ing their rooms. Tho&s;e who ventured abroad, had handkerchiefs or &s;ponges impregnated with vinegar or camphor, at their no&s;es, or el&s;e &s;mel|ling bottles with the thieves' vinegar. Others carried pieces of tar in their hands, or pockets, or camphor bags tied round their necks. The corp&s;es of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable citizens, even of tho&s;e who did not die of the epidemic, were carried to the grave, on the &s;hafts of a chair, the hor&s;e driven by a negro, unattended by a friend or relation, and without any &s;ort of ce|remony. People &s;hifted their cour&s;e at the &s;ight of a hear&s;e coming towards them. Many never walked on the foot path, but went into the middle of the &s;treets, to avoid being infected in pa&s;&s;ing by hou&s;es wherein people had died. Ac|quaintances and friends avoided each other in the &s;treets, and only &s;ignified their regard by a cold nod. The old cu&s;tom of &s;haking hands fell into &s;uch general di&s;u&s;e, that many were affront|ed at even the offer of the hand. A per&s;on with a crape, or any appearance of mourning, was
<PB N="30" REF="025255_0026_0FCCED6D389A4BA0">
&s;hunned like a viper. And many valued them|&s;elves highly on the &s;kill and addre&s;s with which they got to windward of every per&s;on they met. Indeed it is not probable that London, at the la&s;t &s;tage of the plague, exhibited &s;tronger marks of terror, than were to be &s;een in Philadelphia, from the 24th or 25th of Augu&s;t till pretty late in September. When people &s;ummoned up re&s;olution to walk abroad, and take the air, the &s;ick cart conveying patients to the ho&s;pital, or the hear&s;e carrying the dead to the grave, which were travelling almo&s;t the whole day, &s;oon damped their &s;pirits, and plunged them a|gain into de&s;pondency.</P>
<P>While affairs were in this deplorable &s;tate, and the people at the lowe&s;t ebb of de&s;pair, we cannot be a&s;toni&s;hed at the frightful &s;cenes that were acted, which &s;eemed to indicate a total di&s;|&s;olution of the bonds of &s;ociety in the neare&s;t and deare&s;t connexions. Who, without horror, can reflect on a hu&s;band de&s;erting his wife, united to him perhaps for twenty years, in the la&s;t agony&mdash;a wife unfeelingly abandoning her hu&s;band on his death bed&mdash;parents for&s;aking their only children without remor&s;e&mdash;children
<PB N="31" REF="025255_0027_0FCCED6EDDBBF040">
ungratefully flying from their parents, and re|&s;igning them to chance, without an enquiry after their health or &s;afety&mdash;ma&s;ters hurrying off their faithful &s;ervants to Bu&s;hhill, even on &s;u&s;picion of the fever, and that at a time, when, like Tartarus, it was open to every vi&s;itant, but never returned any&mdash;&s;ervants abandoning ten|der and humane ma&s;ters, who only wanted a little care to re&s;tore them to health and u&s;eful|ne&s;s&mdash;who, I &s;ay, can even now think of the&s;e things without horror? Yet &s;uch were daily exhibited in every quarter of our city.</P>
<P>The&s;e de&s;ertions produced &s;cenes of di&s;tre&s;s and mi&s;ery, of which few parallels are to be met with, and which nothing could palliate, but the extraordinary public panic, and the great law of &s;elf pre&s;ervation, the dominion of which ex|tends over the whole animated world. Many men of affluent fortunes, who have given em|ployment and &s;u&s;tenance to hundreds every day in the year, have been abandoned to the care of a negro, after their wives, children, friends, clerks, and &s;ervants had fled away, and left them to their fate. In many ca&s;es, no money could procure proper attendance. With the
<PB N="32" REF="025255_0028_0FCCED7146A8BA28">
poor, the ca&s;e was, as might be expected, infi|nitely wor&s;e than with the rich. Many of the&s;e have peri&s;hed, without a human being to hand them a drink of water, to admini&s;ter medicines, or to perform any charitable office for them. Various in&s;tances have occurred of dead bodies found lying in the &s;treets, of per&s;ons who had no hou&s;e or habitation, and could procure no &s;helter.</P>
<P>A woman, who&s;e hu&s;band had ju&s;t died of the fever, was &s;eized with the pains of labour, and had nobody to a&s;&s;i&s;t her, as the women in the neighbourhood were afraid to go into the hou&s;e. She lay for a con&s;iderable time in a de|gree of angui&s;h that will not bear de&s;cription. At length, &s;he &s;truggled to reach the window, and cried out for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Two men, pa&s;&s;ing by, went up &s;tairs; but they came at too late a &s;tage.&mdash;She was &s;triving with death&mdash;and ac|tually in a few minutes expired in their arms.</P>
<P>A woman, who&s;e hu&s;band and two children lay dead in the room with her, was in the &s;ame &s;ituation, without a midwife, or any other per&s;on to aid her. Her cries at the window brought up one of the carters employed by the committee
<PB N="33" REF="025255_0029_0FCCED726ED2C548">
for the relief of the &s;ick. With his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;he was delivered of a child, which died in a few minutes, as did the mother, who was utterly exhau&s;ted by her labour, by the di&s;order, and by the dreadful &s;pectacle before her. And thus lay in one room, no le&s;s than five dead bodies, an entire family, carried off in an hour or two. Many in&s;tances have occurred, of re&s;pectable women, who, in their lying-in, have been oblig|ed to depend on &s;ervant women for a&s;&s;i&s;tance &mdash;and &s;ome have had none but their hu&s;bands. Some of the midwives were dead&mdash;and others had left the city.</P>
<P>A &s;ervant girl, belonging to a family in this city, in which the fever had prevailed, was ap|prehen&s;ive of danger, and re&s;olved to remove to a relation's hou&s;e, in the country. She was, however, taken &s;ick on the road, and returned to town, where &s;he could find no per&s;on to receive her. One of the guardians of the poor provided a cart, and took her to the alms hou&s;e, into which &s;he was refu&s;ed admittance. She was brought back, and the guardian offered five dol|lars to provide her a &s;ingle night's lodging, but in vain. And in fine, after every effort made to
<PB N="34" REF="025255_0030_0FCCED73E3C4BD00">
provide her &s;helter, &s;he ab&s;olutely expired in the cart.</P>
<P>To relate all the frightful ca&s;es of this nature that occurred, would fill a volume. Let the&s;e few &s;uffice. But I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that mo&s;t of them happened in the fir&s;t &s;tage of the public panic. Afterwards, when the citizens recovered a little from their fright, they became rare.</P>
<P>Great as was the calamity of Philadelphia, it was magnified in the mo&s;t extraordinary man|ner. The hundred tongues of rumour were never more &s;ucce&s;sfully employed, than on this melancholy occa&s;ion. The terror of the inhabi|tants of all the neighbouring &s;tates was excited by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of letters from Philadelphia, di&s;|tributed by every mail, which told tales of woe, whereof hardly a &s;ingle circum&s;tance was true, but which were every where received with impli|cit faith. The di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the city, and the fata|lity of the di&s;order, were exaggerated as it were to &s;ee how far credulity could be carried. The plague of London was, according to ru|mour, hardly more fatal than our yellow fever. Our citizens died &s;o fa&s;t, that there was hardly

</LETTER></NOTE>. And the nature and danger of the di&s;order, were as much mi&s;repre|&s;ented, as the number of the dead. It was &s;aid, in defiance of every day's experience, to be as inevitable by all expo&s;ed to the contagion, as the &s;troke of fate.</P>
<P>The effects produced by the&s;e letters, were &s;uch as might be rea&s;onably expected. The con|&s;ternation &s;pread though the &s;everal &s;tates like wild-fire. The fir&s;t public act that took place on the &s;ubject, as far as I can learn, was at Che&s;ter|town, in Maryland. At this place, a meeting was held on the 10th of September, at which &s;everal re&s;olves were entered into, which, after &s;pecify|ing
<PB N="38" REF="025255_0034_0FCCED7C755FC9B0">
that the di&s;order had extended to Trenton, Princeton, Woodbridge, and Elizabeth-town, on the po&s;t road to New York, directed, that notice &s;hould be &s;ent to the owners of the &s;tages not to allow them to pa&s;s through the town, while there &s;hould be rea&s;on to expect danger therefrom; that a committee of health and in|&s;pection &s;hould be appointed, to provide for the relief of &s;uch poor inhabitants as might take the di&s;order, and likewi&s;e for &s;uch &s;trangers as might be infected with it.

<P>The alarm in New York was fir&s;t officially announced by a letter from the mayor to the practi&s;ing phy&s;icians, dated Sept. 11, in which he reque&s;ts them to report to him in writing the names of all &s;uch per&s;ons as had arrived, or &s;hould arrive from Philadelphia, or any other place, by land or water, and were or &s;hould be &s;ick; that &s;uch as &s;hould be deemed &s;ubjects of

He notified them, that the corporation had taken mea&s;ures to provide a proper place for an ho&s;pital, for &s;uch per&s;ons as might un|happily become &s;ubjects of the fever in New York. In this letter the mayor declared his opi|nion clearly, that the intercour&s;e with Philadel|phia, could not be lawfully interrupted by any power in the &s;tate. The 12th appeared a procla|mation from governor Clinton, which, refer|ring to the
<Q>act to prevent the bringing in, and &s;preading of infectious di&s;orders,</Q>
prohibited, in the terms of that act, all ve&s;&s;els from Phila|delphia, to approach nearer to the city of New York, then Bedlow's i&s;land, about two miles di&s;tant, till duly di&s;charged. The &s;ilence of this proclamation, re&s;pecting pa&s;&s;engers by land, &s;eemed to imply that the governor's opinion on the &s;ubject, was the &s;ame as that of the mayor.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day, at a meeting of the citizens, the nece&s;&s;ity of taking &s;ome precautions was unanimou&s;ly agreed upon, and a committee of &s;even appointed to report a plan to a meet|ing to be held next day. Their report, which was unanimou&s;ly agreed to, the 13th, recom|mended
<PB N="40" REF="025255_0036_0FCCED7FE41FC998">
to hire two phy&s;icians, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the phy&s;ician of the port in his examinations of ve&s;&s;els; to check, as much as po&s;&s;ible, the inter|cour&s;e by &s;tages; to acquaint the proprietors of the &s;outhern &s;tages, that it was the earne&s;t wi&s;h of the inhabitants, that their carriages and boats &s;hould not pa&s;s during the prevalence of the di&s;order in Philadelphia; and to reque&s;t the practitioners of phy&s;ic to report, without fail, every ca&s;e of fever, to which they might be called, occurring in any per&s;ons that had or might arrive from Philadelphia, or have inter|cour&s;e with them. Not &s;atisfied with the&s;e mea|&s;ures, the corporation, on the 17th, came to a re&s;olution to &s;top all intercour&s;e between the two cities; and for this purpo&s;e guards were placed at the different landings, with orders to &s;end back every per&s;on coming from Philadel|phia; and if any were di&s;covered to have arrived after that date, they were to be directly &s;ent back. All per&s;ons taking in lodg|ers, were called upon to give information of all people of the above de&s;cription, under pain of being pro&s;ecuted according to law. All good citizens were required to give information to the mayor, or any member of the committee, of any breach in the premi&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="025255_0037_0FCCED815D65DD18">All the&s;e &s;trict precautions being eluded by the fears and the vigilance of the fugitives from Philadelphia, on the 23d there was a meeting held, of delegates from the &s;everal wards of the city, in order to adopt more effectual mea&s;ures. At this meeting, it was re&s;olved to e&s;tabli&s;h a night watch of not le&s;s than ten citizens in each ward, to guard again&s;t &s;uch as might e&s;cape them by day.

They therefore again called upon their fellow citizens to be cautious how they received &s;trangers into their hou&s;es; not to fail to report all &s;uch to the mayor immediately upon their arrival; to remember the importance of the occa&s;ion; and to con&s;ider what reply they &s;hould make to the ju&s;t re&s;entment of their fellow citizens, who&s;e lives they might expo&s;e by a criminal neglect, or infidelity. They likewi&s;e declared their ex|pectation, that tho&s;e who kept the different ferries on the &s;hores of New Jer&s;ey and Staten i&s;land, would pay &s;uch attention to their ad|dre&s;s, as not to tran&s;port any per&s;on but to the

The 30th they publi&s;hed a lengthy addre&s;s, recapitulating the various pre|cautions they had taken&mdash;the nature of the di&s;order&mdash;and the numbers who had died out of Philadelphia, without communicating it to any one. They at the &s;ame time re&s;olved, that goods, bedding, and clothing, packed up in Philadelphia, &s;hould, previous to their being brought into New York, be unpacked and ex|po&s;ed to the open air in &s;ome well-ventilated place, for at lea&s;t 48 hours; that all linen or cotton clothes, or bedding, which had been u&s;ed, &s;hould be well wa&s;hed in &s;everal waters; and af|terwards, that the whole, both &s;uch as had been, and &s;uch as had not been u&s;ed, &s;hould be hung up in a clo&s;e room, and well &s;moked with the fumes of brim&s;tone for one day, and after that again expo&s;ed for at lea&s;t twenty four hours to the open air; and that the boxes, trunks, or che&s;ts, in which they had been packed, &s;hould be cleaned and aired in the &s;ame manner; after which, being repacked, and &s;uch evidence given of their purification, as the committee &s;hould re|quire, permi&s;&s;ion might be had to bring them into the city.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="025255_0039_0FCCED85A8A9FD08">The 11th of October, they likewi&s;e re&s;olved, that they would con&s;ider and publi&s;h to the world, as enemies to the welfare of the city, and the lives of its inhabitants, all tho&s;e who &s;hould be &s;o &s;elfi&s;h and hardy, as to attempt to intro|troduce any goods, wares, merchandize, bed|ding, baggage, &amp;c. imported from, or packed up in Philadelphia, contrary to the rules pre&s;cribed by that body, who were, they &s;aid, deputed to expre&s;s the will of their fellow citizens. They recommended to the inhabitants to with&s;tand any temptation of profit, which might attend the purcha&s;e of goods in Philadel|phia, as no emolument to an individual, they added, could warrant the hazard to which &s;uch conduct might expo&s;e the city.

<P>I did not choo&s;e to interrupt this account of the proceedings of the committee of health, to mention, in order of time, that the clergy of New York had a meeting, on the 16th of Sep|tember, and unanimou&s;ly agreed to &s;et apart Friday, the 20th, as a day of humiliation, fa&s;t|ing,

and prayer to Almighty God, for the pre|&s;ervation of their city, from the fever, and for the comfort and &s;upport of their brethren in Philadelphia, in the &s;ea&s;on of their di&s;tre&s;s. The Dutch &s;ynod of New York had a meeting the fir&s;t week in October, at which they agreed that tho&s;e churches under their care, which had not yet ob&s;erved a day of fa&s;t and prayer, &s;hould devote the &s;econd Wedne&s;day in November to that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Trenton and Lamberton a&s;|&s;ociated on the 13th of Sept. and on the 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal re&s;olutions to guard them&s;elves again&s;t the contagion.

The people of Jer&s;ey ob&s;erved the 1&s;t of October, as a day of fa&s;t and prayer, for the &s;ame purpo&s;e as tho&s;e of New York.</P>
<P>The 12th of September, the governor of Ma|ryland publi&s;hed a proclamation, &s;ubjecting all ve&s;&s;els from Philadelphia to the performance of a quarantine, not exceeding forty days, or as much le&s;s as might be judged &s;afe by the health officers. It further ordered, that all per|&s;ons going to Baltimore, to Havre de Grace, to the head of Elk, or, by any other route, making their way into that &s;tate from Phila|delphia, or any other place known to be infect|ed with the malignant fever, &s;hould be &s;ubject to be examined, and prevented from proceed|ing,

<P>The people of Baltimore met the 13th of September, and re&s;olved that none of their ci|tizens &s;hould receive into their hou&s;es any per|&s;ons coming from Philadelphia, or other in|fected place, without producing a certificate from the health officer, or officer of patrol; and that any per&s;on who violated that re&s;olve, &s;hould be held up to public view, as a proper object for the re&s;entment of the town. The 14th, a party of militia was di&s;patched to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a pa&s;s on the Philadelphia road, about two miles from Baltimore, to prevent the entrance of any pa&s;&s;engers from Philadelphia without licen&s;e. Dr. Worthington, the health officer &s;tationed at this pa&s;s, was directed to re|fu&s;e permi&s;&s;ion to per&s;ons afflicted with any malignant complaint, or who had not been ab|&s;ent from Philadelphia, or other infected place,

<P>The 30th, the committee of health re&s;olved that no inhabitant of Baltimore, who &s;hould vi&s;it per&s;ons from Philadelphia, while perform|ing quarantine, &s;hould be permitted to enter the town, until the time of quarantine was ex|pired, and until it was certainly known that the per&s;ons he had vi&s;ited were free from the infec|tion; and that thenceforward no goods capable of conveying infection, that had been landed or packed up in Philadelphia, or other infected place, &s;hould be permitted to enter the town&mdash; nor &s;hould any baggage of travellers be admit|ted, until it had been expo&s;ed to the open air &s;uch length of time as the health officer might direct.</P>
<P>The 25th of September, the inhabitants of Havre de Grace, re&s;olved that no per&s;on &s;hould be allowed to cro&s;s the Su&s;quehannah river at that place, who did not bring a certificate of his not having lately come from Philadelphia, or any other infected place; and that the citizens of

<P>At Hager&s;town, on the 3d of October, it was re&s;olved, that no citizen &s;hould receive into his hou&s;e any per&s;on coming from Philadelphia, &s;uppo&s;ed to be infected with the malignant fe|ver, until he or &s;he produced a certificate from a health officer; that &s;hould any citizen contra|vene the above re&s;olution, he &s;hould be cut off from all &s;ociety with his fellow citizens; that the clothing &s;ent to the troops then in that town, &s;hould not be received there, nor &s;uffered to come within &s;even miles thereof; that if any per&s;on from Philadelphia, or other infected place, &s;hould arrive there, he &s;hould be required in&s;tantly to depart, and in ca&s;e of refu&s;al or ne|glect, be compelled to go without delay; that no merchant, or other per&s;on, &s;hould be permit|ted to bring into the town, or open therein, any goods brought from Philadelphia, or other infected place, until permitted by the com|mittee; and that the citizens of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he town, and its vicinity, &s;hould enrol them&s;elves as a guard, and patrole &s;uch road and pa&s;&s;es as the commit|tee &s;hould direct.</P>

<P>The &s;electmen of Bo&s;ton, on the 24th, pub|li&s;hed their regulations of quarantine, which ordered, that on the arrival of any ve&s;&s;el from Philadelphia, &s;he &s;hould be detained at, or near Rainsford's I&s;land, to perform a quarantine not exceeding thirty days, during which time &s;he &s;hould be clean&s;ed with vinegar, and the ex|plo&s;ion of gunpowder between the decks and

All per&s;ons con|travening this proclamation, were to be pro&s;e|cuted, and &s;ubjected to the pains and penalties by law pointed out.</P>
<P>The people of Augu&s;ta, in that &s;tate, were

<P>A re&s;pectable number of the inhabitants of Springfield, in New Jer&s;ey, met the fir&s;t day of October, and after a full con&s;ideration of the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of our citizens, pa&s;&s;ed a re&s;olve, offer|ing their town as an a&s;ylum to the people flying from Philadelphia, and directing their commit|tee to provide a &s;uitable place as an ho&s;pital for &s;uch of them as might be &s;eized with the pre|vailing malignant fever.</P>
<P>I have been informed, by a per&s;on of credit, that the inhabitants of Elizabeth town have pur&s;ued the &s;ame liberal pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, as tho&s;e of Springfield; but have not been able to procure
<PB N="55" REF="025255_0051_0FCCED9AE1B65F00">
a copy of their re&s;olves or proceedings on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>An a&s;ylum has likewi&s;e been offered to Phila|delphians, by &s;everal of the inhabitants of Elk|ton, in Maryland; and the offer was couched in terms of the utmo&s;t &s;ympathy for our &s;uf|ferings.</P>
<P>The in&s;tances of this kind, through this ex|ten&s;ive country, have been very few; but they are therefore only the more precious, and ought to be held up to public approbation. May they operate on people, at a future day, in &s;imilar ca&s;es of dreadful calamity&mdash;and teach them to temper their caution with as much humanity and tenderne&s;s to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed fugitives, as prudence will allow&mdash;and not in|volve in one indi&s;criminate pro&s;cription the healthy and infected.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the &s;ituation of affairs in Philadelphia, became daily more and more &s;eri|ous. The three guardians of the poor for the city, who, as I have &s;aid, continued to act, were quite oppre&s;&s;ed with the labours of their office, which increa&s;ed to &s;uch a degree, that they
<PB N="56" REF="025255_0052_0FCCED9E070178E8">
were utterly unable to execute them. The num|ber of di&s;ea&s;ed per&s;ons became very great. Owing to the general terror, nur&s;es, carters, and attendants could hardly be procured. Thus circum&s;tanced, the mayor of the city, on the 10th of September, publi&s;hed an addre&s;s to the citizens, announcing that the guardians of the poor, who remained, were in di&s;tre&s;s for want of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and inviting &s;uch benevolent citi|zens as felt for the general di&s;tre&s;s, to lend their aid. In con&s;equence of this adverti&s;ement, a meeting of the citizens was held at the city hall, on the 12th of September, at which very few attended, from the univeral con&s;ternation that prevailed. The &s;tate of the poor was fully con&s;idered; and ten citizens, I&s;rael I&s;rael, Sa|muel Wetherill, Thomas Wi&s;tar, Andrew Ad|gate, Caleb Lownes, Henry Defore&s;t, Thomas Peters, Jo&s;eph In&s;keep, Stephen Gerard, and John Ma&s;on, offered them&s;elves to a&s;&s;i&s;t the guardians of the poor. At this meeting, a com|mittee was appointed to confer with the phy&s;i|cians who had the care of Bu&s;h-hill. This committee reported next evening, that the ho&s;pital was in very bad order, and in want of almo&s;t every thing.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="025255_0053_0FCCED9F5DBFD840">The 14th, another meeting was held, when the urgent nece&s;&s;ities of the &s;ick being fully con&s;ide|dered, it was re&s;olved to borrow 1500 dollars of the bank of North America, for the purpo&s;e of procuring &s;uitable accommodations for the u&s;e of per&s;ons afflicted with the prevailing malig|nant fever. At this meeting, a committee was appointed to tran&s;act the whole of the bu&s;ine&s;s relative to the relief of the &s;ick, and the procu|ring of phy&s;icians, nur&s;es, attendants, &amp;c. This is the committee, which, by virtue of that ap|pointment, has from that day to the pre&s;ent time, watched over the &s;ick, the poor, they wi|dow, and the orphan. It is worthy of remark, and may encourage others in times of public ca|lamity, that this committee con&s;i&s;ted originally of only twenty-&s;ix per&s;ons, men taken from the middle walks of life, and of the moderate pitch of abilities; of the&s;e, four, Andrew Ad|gate, Jonathan Dickin&s;on Sargeant, Daniel Of|fley, and Jo&s;eph In&s;keep, died, the two fir&s;t at an early period of their labours&mdash;and four ne|ver attended to the appointment. "The heat and burden of the day" have therefore been borne by eighteen per&s;ons, who&s;e exertions have been &s;o highly favoured by providence, that
<PB N="58" REF="025255_0054_0FCCEDA26E442978">
they have been the in&s;truments of averting the progre&s;s of de&s;truction, eminently relieving the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and re&s;toring confidence to the ter|rified inhabitants of Philadelphia. It is honoura|ble to this committee, that from the time of their organization to the pre&s;ent, they have li|ved together in more harmony than is generally to be met with in public bodies of equal num|ber.</P>
<P>Never, perhaps, was there a city in the &s;itu|ation of Philadelphia at this period. The pre&s;i|dent of the united &s;tates, according to his an|nual cu&s;tom, had removed to Mount Vernon, with his hou&s;ehold. Mo&s;t, if not all of the other officers of the federal government were ab&s;ent. The governor, who had been &s;ick, had gone, by directions of his phy&s;ician, to his coun|try &s;eat near the talls of Schuylkill&mdash;and nearly the whole of the officers of the &s;tate had likewi&s;e retired.&mdash;The magi&s;trates of the city, except the mayor, were away, as were mo&s;t of tho&s;e of the liberties. Of the &s;ituation of the guardians of the poor I have already made mention. In fact, government of every kind was almo&s;t wholly vacated, and by univer&s;al con&s;ent ve&s;ted in the committee.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="025255_0055_0FCCEDA41A352AE0">On the 15th, the committee re&s;olved, that three members of their board &s;hould attend daily at the city hall, to receive applications for relief, to provide for the burial of the dead, and the conveyance to Bu&s;hhill of all per&s;ons la|bouring under the fever, who might be willing to go there. This order was &s;oon re&s;cinded, it being found nece&s;&s;ary for all the members to at|tend at the hall.</P>
<P>This day, a circum&s;tance occurred, to which the mo&s;t glowing pencil could hardly do ju&s;tice. Stephen Girard, a wealthy merchant, a native of France, touched with the wretched &s;ituation of the &s;ufferers at Bu&s;h hill, voluntarily and unex|pectedly offered to &s;uperintend that ho&s;pital. The &s;urpri&s;e and &s;atisfaction, excited by this extraor|dinary effort of humanity, can be better con|ceived than expre&s;&s;ed. Peter Helm, a native of Penn&s;ylvania, actuated by the like benevolent motives, offered his &s;ervices in the &s;ame depart|ment. Their offers were accepted, and the &s;ame afternoon they entered on the execution of their dangerous and prai&s;eworthy office.</P>
<P>To form a ju&s;t e&s;timate of the value of the offer of the&s;e men, it is nece&s;&s;ary to take into
<PB N="60" REF="025255_0056_0FCCEDA597C93008">
full con&s;ideration the general con&s;ternation, which at that period pervaded every quarter of the city, and which made attendance on the &s;ick be regarded as little le&s;s than a certain &s;acrifice. Uninfluenced by any reflexions of this kind, with|out any po&s;&s;ible inducement but the pure&s;t motives of humanity, they came forward, and offered them&s;elves as the forlorn hope of the committee. I tru&s;t that the gratitude of their fellow citizens will remain as long as the memory of their bene|ficent conduct, which I hope will not die with the pre&s;ent generation. While I am on this &s;ubject, let me add, that from the time of undertaking this office to the pre&s;ent, they have attended un|interruptedly, for &s;ix, &s;even or eight hours a day, renouncing almo&s;t every care of private affairs. They have had a mo&s;t irk&s;ome tour of duty to perform&mdash;to encourage and comfort the &s;ick&mdash;to hand them nece&s;&s;aries and medicines&mdash;to wipe the &s;weat off their brows&mdash;and to perform many di&s;gu&s;ting offices of kindne&s;s for them, which nothing could render tolerable, but the exalted motives that impelled them to this heroic conduct.</P>
<P>On the 16th, the managers of Bu&s;hhill, after
<PB N="61" REF="025255_0057_0FCCEDA6D924D808">
per&s;onal in&s;pection of the &s;tate of affairs there, made report of its &s;ituation, which was truly deplorable. It exhibited as wretched a picture of human mi&s;ery as ever exi&s;ted. A profligate, abandoned &s;et of nur&s;es and attendants (hardly any of good character could at that time be procured,) rioted on the provi&s;ions and com|forts, prepared for the &s;ick, who (unle&s;s at the hours when the doctors attended) were left al|mo&s;t entirely de&s;titute of every a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The dying and dead were indi&s;criminately mingled together. The ordure and other evacuations of the &s;ick, were allowed to remain in the mo&s;t offen&s;ive &s;tate imaginable. Not the &s;malle&s;t ap|pearance of order or regularity exi&s;ted. It was, in fact, a great human &s;laughter hou&s;e, where numerous victims were immolated at the altar of riot and intemperance. No wonder, then, that a general dread of the place prevailed through the city, and that a removal to it was con&s;idered as the &s;eal of death. In con&s;equence, there were various in&s;tances of &s;ick per&s;ons locking their rooms, and re&s;i&s;ting every attempt to carry them away. At length, the poor were &s;o much afraid of being &s;ent to Bu&s;hhill, that they would not acknowledge their illne&s;s, until

it was no longer po&s;&s;ible to conceal it. For it is to be ob&s;erved, that the fear of the contagion was &s;o prevalent, that as &s;oon as any one was taken &s;ick, an alarm was &s;pread among the neighbours, and every effort was u&s;ed to have the &s;ick per&s;on hurried off to Bu&s;hhill, to avoid &s;preading the di&s;order. The ca&s;es of the per|&s;ons forced in this way to that ho&s;pital, though labouring under only common colds, and common fall fevers, are numerous and af|flicting. There were not wanting in&s;tances of per&s;ons, only &s;lightly ill, being &s;ent to Bu&s;hhill, by their panic-&s;truck neighbours, and embra|cing the fir&s;t opportunity of running back to Philadelphia. But the ca&s;e was &s;oon altered un|der the direction of the two managers, Girard and Helm. They introduced &s;uch order and regularity, and had the patients treated with &s;o much care and tenderne&s;s, that they retrieved the character of the ho&s;pital; and in the cour&s;e of a week or two, numbers of &s;ick people, who had not at home proper per&s;ons to nur&s;e them, applied to be &s;ent to Bu&s;hhill. Indeed, in the end, &s;o many people, who were afflicted with other di&s;orders, procured admittance there, that it be|come nece&s;&s;ary to pa&s;s a re&s;olve, that before an

order of admi&s;&s;ion &s;hould be granted, a certifi|cate mu&s;t be produced from a phy&s;ician, that the patient laboured under the malignant fever.</P>
<P>The committee &s;at daily at the city hall, and engaged a number of carts to convey the dead to a place of interment, and the &s;ick to the ho&s;|pital. From their organization to the pre&s;ent time, they have mo&s;t unremittingly attended to the di&s;charge of the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them. Neither the regular increa&s;e of deaths till to|wards the middle of October, nor the afflicting lo&s;s of four very active members, in quick &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion, appalled them. That the mortality would have been incomparably greater, but for their active interpo&s;ition, is beyond doubt; as mo&s;t of tho&s;e who went to Bu&s;hhill, and died there, would have otherwi&s;e died in the city, and &s;pread the contagion: and the dead bodies would have remained putrifying in de&s;erted hou&s;es in every part of the city, and operated as dreadfully as the plague it&s;elf. In fact, at the time they entered on the execution of the dan|gerous office they undertook, there were found &s;everal bodies that had lain in this &s;tate for two, three, and four days.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="025255_0060_0FCCEDAB61BFDCB0">In the progre&s;s of the di&s;order, the committee found the calls on their humanity increa&s;e. The numerous deaths of heads of families l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ft a very large body of children in a mo&s;t abandon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, for|lorn &s;tate. The bettering hou&s;e, in which &s;uch helple&s;s objects have been u&s;ually placed hereto|fore, was barred again&s;t them, by the order which I have already mentioned. Many of the&s;e little innocents were actually &s;uffering for want of even common nece&s;&s;aries. The deaths of their parents and protectors, which &s;hould have been the &s;tronge&s;t recommendation to public charity, was the very rea&s;on of their di&s;tre&s;s, and of their being &s;hunned as a pe&s;tilence. The children of a family once in ea&s;y circum&s;tances, were found in a black&s;mith's &s;hop, &s;qualid, dirty, and half &s;tarved, having been for a con&s;iderable time without even bread to eat. Various in&s;tances of a &s;imilar nature occurred. This evil early caught the attention of the committee&punc; and on the 19th of September, they hired a hou&s;e in Fifth-&s;treet, in which they placed thirteen children. The number increa&s;ing, on the 3d of October, they procured the Loganian library, which was ge|nerou&s;ly given up by John Swanwick, E&s;q. for the purpo&s;e of an orphan hou&s;e. A further in|crea&s;e
<PB N="65" REF="025255_0061_0FCCEDACDFE55FF0">
of their little charge, rendered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ce&s;&s;ary to build &s;ome additions to the library, which are now fini&s;hed, and are nearly half as large as that building. At pre&s;ent, there are in the hou&s;e, un|der the care of the orphan committee, above eighty children, and about forty are out with wet nur&s;es. From the origin of the in&s;titution, one hundred and &s;ixty children have fallen un|der their care, of whom &s;even are dead, all of whom, except one, were &s;ucking children; and about thirty have been delivered to their relati|ons or friends. There are in&s;tances of five and &s;ix children of a &s;ingle family in the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Another duty &s;oon attracted the attention of the committee. The flight of &s;o many of our ci|tizens, the con&s;equent &s;tagnation of bu&s;ine&s;s, and the almo&s;t total ce&s;&s;ation of the labours of the guardians of the poor, brought on among the lower cla&s;&s;es of the people, a great degree of di&s;tre&s;s, which loudly demanded the interpo&s;i|tion of the humane. In con&s;equence, on the 20th of September, a &s;ub-committee of di&s;tribu|tion was appointed, to furni&s;h &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance to de&s;erving objects as their re&s;pective ca&s;es might

require, and the funds allow<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">They had, in addition to the fir&s;t loan from the bank of North America, borrowed 5000 dollars from the &s;ame in&s;titution, making in the whole 6500.</NOTE>. This was at fir&s;t admini&s;tered &s;paringly, owing to the confined &s;tate of their finances. But the very extraordi|nary liberality of our fugitive fellow citizens, of the citizens of New York, and of tho&s;e of va|rious towns and town&s;hips, encouraged the committee to extend their views. And frequent impo&s;itions being attempted on them, they, on the 14th of October, called to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance a number of re&s;pectable characters in the different parts of the city and liberties, to &s;eek out and give recommendations to de&s;erving objects in di&s;tre&s;s. The&s;e gentlemen have undertaken this trouble&s;ome office, which they execute with &s;o much circum&s;pection, as to defeat the arts of impo&s;tors. At pre&s;ent, there are about twelve hundred people relieved weekly, mo&s;t of whom have con&s;iderable families, &s;ome of four, &s;ix, and eight per&s;ons. The number, therefore, de|pending on the committee for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, is pro|bably above four thou&s;and. The gradual revival

of bu&s;ine&s;s promi&s;es to re&s;cue &s;ome of the&s;e peo|ple &s;peedily from the humiliation of a depen|dence on public charity; and the organization of the guardians of the poor will make provi&s;i|on for the remainder.</P>
<P>From this time, the proceedings of the com|mittee went on in a regular, uniform tenor, every day like the pa&s;t, without any thing re|markable occurring, worth recording. For above five weeks of the time they have been employ|ed, the mo&s;t dreary pro&s;pects appeared before them. The number of per&s;ons to be removed to Bu&s;hhill daily, was for a long time from twenty to thirty&mdash;and the number to be buried by their carters, was often equal. The&s;e two cir|cum&s;tances, the removals to the ho&s;pital, and the per&s;ons buried from the city-hall, were re|garded as the barometer, by which to judge of the &s;tate of the di&s;ea&s;e; and in general they were a ju&s;t one.</P>
<P>The week, beginning Sunday the 27th of October, proved for the mo&s;t part cold and raw. Ea&s;terly winds generally prevailed. Thur&s;day and Friday, there was a con&s;iderable fall of rain.
<PB N="68" REF="025255_0064_0FCCEDB1739638F8">
A vi&s;ible alteration has already taken place in the &s;tate of affairs in the city. Our ab&s;ent friends return in crowds. Every hour in the day, old faces appear&mdash;and in many in&s;tances, tho&s;e of per&s;ons, whom public fame has buried for weeks pa&s;t. The &s;tores, &s;o long clo&s;ed, are opening fa&s;t. Some of the country merchants, bolder than others, are daily venturing in to their old place of &s;upply. Market-&s;treet is nearly as full of wag|gons as u&s;ual. The cu&s;tom hou&s;e, for weeks near|ly de&s;erted by our mercantile people, is throng|ed by citizens entering their ve&s;&s;els and goods &mdash;the &s;treets, too long the abode of gloom and de&s;pair, have a&s;&s;umed the bu&s;tle &s;uitable to the &s;ea&s;on. The arrival in the city of our beloved pre&s;ident gives us a flattering pro&s;pect of the next &s;e&s;&s;ion of congre&s;s being held here. And, in fine, as every thing, in the early &s;tage of the di&s;order, &s;eemed calculated to add to the general con&s;ternation; &s;o now, on the contrary, every circum&s;tance has a tendency to revive the courage and hopes of our citizens. But we have to lament, that the &s;ame &s;pirit of exaggeration and lying, that prevailed at a for|mer period, and was the grand cau&s;e of the har&s;h mea&s;ures adopted by our &s;i&s;ter &s;tates, has
<PB N="69" REF="025255_0065_0FCCEDB2DB50A148">
not cea&s;ed to operate; for at the pre&s;ent mo|ment, when the danger is entirely done away, the credulous of our own citizens &s;till ab&s;ent, and of the country people, are &s;till alarmed by frightful rumours, of the di&s;order raging with as much violence as ever; of numbers carried off, a few hours after their return; and of new ca&s;es daily occurring. To what de&s;ign to attri|bute the&s;e &s;hameful tales, I know not. Were I to regard them in a &s;pirit of re&s;entment, I &s;hould be inclined to charge them to &s;ome &s;ecret, inter|e&s;ted views of their authors, intent, if po&s;&s;ible, to effect the entire de&s;truction of our city. But I will not allow my&s;elf to con&s;ider them in this point of light&mdash;and will even &s;uppo&s;e they ari&s;e from a pronene&s;s to terrific narration, natural to &s;ome men. But they &s;hould con&s;ider, that we are in the &s;ituation of the frogs in the fable&mdash; while the&s;e tales, which make the hair of the country people &s;tand an end, are &s;port to the fa|bricators, they are death to us. And I here a&s;&s;ert, and defy contradiction, that of the whole num|ber of our fugitive citizens, who have already returned, amounting to &s;ome thou&s;ands, not above two are dead&mdash;and the&s;e owe their fate to the mo&s;t &s;hameful neglect of airing and
<PB N="70" REF="025255_0066_0FCCEDB5EBA80E50">
clean&s;ing their hou&s;es, notwith&s;tanding the vari|ous cautions publi&s;hed by the committee. If peo|ple will venture into hou&s;es in which infected air has been pent up for weeks together without any purification, we cannot be &s;urprized at the con&s;equences, however fatal they may be. But let not the cata&s;trophe of a few incautious per|&s;ons operate to bring di&s;credit on a city contain|ing above fifty thou&s;and people.</P>
<P>At the time of writing the&s;e lines, the 10th of November, the committee look forward with plea&s;ure to the moment of &s;urrendering up their tru&s;t to a town meeting of their fellow citizens, the con&s;tituents by whom they were called into the extraordinary office they have filled. To them they will give an account of their &s;tew|ard&s;hip in a time of di&s;tre&s;s, the like of which heaven avert from the people of America for|ever. They hope a candid con&s;truction will be put upon their conduct&mdash;and that it will be be|lieved that they have acted in every ca&s;e that has come under their cognizance, according to the be&s;t of their judgment.</P>
<P>The &s;ympathy for our calamities di&s;played in
<PB N="71" REF="025255_0067_0FCCEDB835C050A0">
various places, reflects the highe&s;t honour on their inhabitants, and demands our warme&s;t gratitude. The inhabitants of Glouce&s;ter county in New Jer&s;ey, have the honour of being fir&s;t in this laudable race. So early as the 30th of September, they had a con&s;iderable &s;um collect|ed, with which they purcha&s;ed a quantity of provi&s;ions for the u&s;e of the ho&s;pital at Bu&s;h-hill. They have from that time regularly con|tinued copious &s;upplies twice a week. From a few citizens of Philadelphia, near Germantown, there have been received two thou&s;and dollars; from others near Darby, fourteen hundred; from New York, five thou&s;and; from a per&s;on unknown, five hundred; from Bucks' county &s;ixteen hundred; from Delaware county twelve hundred; from Franklin county nearly five hun|dred; from Bo&s;ton &s;undry articles, e&s;timated at twenty-five hundred; and from &s;undry other per&s;ons and places, contributions equally liberal and honourable.</P>
<P>The di&s;order raged with increa&s;ed violence, as the &s;ea&s;on advanced towards the mild fall months. In the month of September, the mor|tality was much greater than in Augu&s;t; and &s;till greater in October, to the 25th, than in Sep|tember.
<PB N="72" REF="025255_0068_0FCCEDBA4E3D37C8">
What is very particularly worthy of attention, is, that though all the hopes of the citizens re&s;ted on cold and rain, e&s;pecially the latter, yet the di&s;order was extingui&s;hed with hardly any rain, and a very moderate degree of cold. The 26th may be &s;et down as the day when the virulence of the fever expired. The deaths afterwards were few, and mo&s;tly of tho&s;e long &s;ick. Hardly any per&s;ons have &s;ince ta|ken it. That day was as warm as many of the mo&s;t fatal ones in the early part of the month. To account for this is perhaps above our power. In fact, the whole of the di&s;order, from its fir&s;t appearance to its final clo&s;e, has &s;et human wi&s;|dom and calculation at defiance.</P>
<P>Rarely has it happened, that &s;o large a pro|portion of the gentlemen of the faculty have &s;unk beneath the labours of their very dange|rous profe&s;&s;ion, as on this occa&s;ion. In little more than a month, exclu&s;ive of medical &s;tudents, no le&s;s than ten phy&s;icians have been &s;wept off, doc|tors Hutchin&s;on, Morris, Linn, Pennington, Dodds, John&s;on, Glentworth, Phile, Graham, and Green. Hardly one of the practi&s;ing doctors that remained in the city, e&s;caped &s;ickne&s;s&mdash; &s;ome were three, four, and five times confined.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="025255_0069_0FCCEDBB263D9CA0">To the clergy it has likewi&s;e proved very fatal. Expo&s;ed, in the exerci&s;e of the la&s;t duties to the dying, to equal danger with the phy&s;ici|ans, it is not &s;urpri&s;ing that &s;o many of them have fallen. Their names are, the rev. Alexander Murray, of the prote&s;tant epi&s;copal church&mdash;the rev. F. A. Fleming and the rev. Laurence Grae&s;sl of the Roman catholic&mdash;the rev. John Winkhau&s;e, of the German reformed&mdash;the rev. James Sproat, of the pre&s;byterian&mdash;the rev. William Dougherty, of the methodi&s;t church&mdash; and three preachers of the Friends &s;ociety, Da|niel Offley, Hu&s;on Lang&s;troth, and Charles Williams. Six clergymen have been in the greate&s;t danger from this di&s;order, the rev. R. Blackwell, rev. Jo&s;eph Pilmore, rev. William Rogers, rev. Chri&s;topher V. Keating, rev. Fre|deric Schmidt, and the rev. Jo&s;eph Turner; but they have all recovered.</P>
<P>Among the women, the mortality has not by any means been &s;o great, as among the men<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In many congregations, the deaths of men have been twice as numerous as tho&s;e of women.</NOTE>,
<PB N="74" REF="025255_0070_0FCCEDBCCC91C9E8">
nor among the old and infirm as among the mid|dle-aged and robu&s;t.</P>
<P>To tipplers and drunkards, and to men who lived high, and were of a corpulent habit of body, this di&s;order was very fatal. Of the&s;e, many were &s;eized, and the recoveries were very rare.</P>
<P>To the <HI>filles de joie,</HI> it has been equally fatal. The wretched debilitated &s;tate of their con&s;titu|tions, rendered them an ea&s;y prey to this dread|ful di&s;order, which very &s;oon terminated their mi&s;erable career.</P>
<P>It has been dreadfully de&s;tructive among the poor. It is very probable, that at lea&s;t &s;even eighths of the number of the dead, were of that cla&s;s. The inhabitants of dirty hou&s;es have &s;everely expiated their neglect of cleanli|ne&s;s and decency, by the numbers of them that have fallen &s;acrifices. Whole families in &s;uch hou&s;es have &s;unk into one &s;ilent, undi&s;tingui&s;h|ing grave.</P>
<P>The mortality in confined &s;treets, &s;mall al|lies,
<PB N="75" REF="025255_0071_0FCCEDBEE3F7FE18">
and clo&s;e hou&s;es, debarred of a free circu|lation of air, has exceeded, in a great proportion, that in the large &s;treets and well-aired hou&s;es. In &s;ome of the allies, a third or fourth of the whole of the inhabitants are no more. In 30 hou&s;es, the whole number in Pewter Platter alley, 32 peo|ple died: and in Market-&s;treet, in 170 hou&s;es, only 39. The &s;treets in the &s;uburbs that had the benefit of the country air, e&s;pecially towards the we&s;t part of the city, have &s;uffered little. Of the wide, airy &s;treets, none lo&s;t &s;o many people as Arch, near Water-&s;treet, which may be account|ed for by its proximity to the original &s;eat of the di&s;order. It is to be particularly remarked, that in general, the more remote the &s;treets were from Water &s;treet, the le&s;s they experienced of the calamity.</P>
<P>From the effects of this di&s;order, the French &s;ettled in Philadelphia, have been in a very re|markable degree exempt. To what this may be owing, is a &s;ubject de&s;erving particular inve&s;tiga|tion. By &s;ome it has been a&s;cribed to their de|&s;pi&s;ing the danger. But, though this may have had &s;ome effect, it will not certainly account for it altogether; as it is well known that
<PB N="76" REF="025255_0072_0FCCEDC12346E628">
many of the mo&s;t courageous per&s;ons in Phila|delphia, have been among its victims. By many of the French, the prevalence and mortality of the di&s;order have been attributed to the va&s;t quantities of crude and unwhole&s;ome fruits brought to our markets, and con&s;umed by all cla&s;&s;es of people.</P>
<P>The effect of fear in predi&s;po&s;ing the body for this and other di&s;orders, and increa&s;ing their malignance, when taken, is well known. The following exception to the general rule, for the truth of which I pledge my&s;elf, is curious and intere&s;ting. A young woman, who&s;e fears were &s;o very prevalent, as not only to render her un|happy from the commencement of the di&s;order, but even to interfere with the happine&s;s of the family with whom &s;he lived, had to attend on &s;even per&s;ons, all of whom were in a very dan|gerous &s;tate, and one of whom died. Her at|tendance was a&s;&s;iduous and unremitted for nearly three weeks. Yet &s;he has never been in the &s;lighte&s;t degree affected.</P>
<P>At an early &s;tage of the di&s;order, the elders of the African church met, and offered their
<PB N="77" REF="025255_0073_0FCCEDC5CAFC8BB8">
&s;ervices to the mayor, to procure nur&s;es for the &s;ick, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t in burying the dead. Their offers were accepted; and Ab&s;alom Jones and Richard Allen undertook the former de|partment, that of furni&s;hing nur&s;es, and Wil|liam Gray, the latter&mdash;the interment of the dead. The great demand for nur&s;es afforded an opportunity for impo&s;ition, which was eager|ly &s;eized by &s;ome of the vile&s;t of the blacks. They extorted two, three, four, and even five dollars a night for attendance, which would have been well paid by a &s;ingle dollar. Some of them were even detected in plundering the hou&s;es of the &s;ick. But it is wrong to ca&s;t a cen&s;ure on the whole for this &s;ort of conduct, as many people have done. The &s;ervices of Jones, Allen, and Gray, and others of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ur, have been very great, and demand public grati|tude.</P>

<P>Tho&s;e who reflect on the many revolting ca|&s;es of cruelty and de&s;ertion of friends and re|lations which occurred in Philadelphia, how|ever they may regret, cannot be &s;urpri&s;ed, that in the country and in various towns and cities, inhumanity &s;hould be experienced by Philadel|phians from &s;trangers. The univer&s;al con&s;ter|nation extingui&s;hed in people's brea&s;ts the mo&s;t honourable feelings of human nature; and in this ca&s;e, as in various others, the &s;u&s;|picion
<PB N="79" REF="025255_0075_0FCCEDC96E04CEB8">
operated as injuriou&s;ly as the reality. Many travellers from this city, exhau&s;ted with fatigue and with hunger, have been refu&s;ed all &s;helter and all &s;u&s;tenance, and have fallen victims to the fears, not to the want of cha|rity, of tho&s;e to whom they applied for re|lief. In&s;tances of this kind have occurred on almo&s;t every road leading from Philadelphia. People under &s;u&s;picion of having this di&s;order, have been forced by their fellow travellers to quit the &s;tages, and peri&s;hed in the woods without a po&s;&s;ibility of procuring any a&s;&s;i&s;tance.

of all the re&s;olutions entered into by the in|habitants of various towns, many of our infect|ed citizens evaded their vigilance, and took re|fuge among them, and in only one or two ca|&s;es is it known that they communicated the di&s;order&mdash;and even in the&s;e not mortally. Three per&s;ons from Philadelphia died of this di&s;order, in one hou&s;e at Woodbury, in New Jer&s;ey; they had been attended during their illne&s;s by the family, none of whom caught the infection. Six or &s;even died at Darby, as ma|ny at Germantown, and eight at Haddonfield, without communicating it to any of the inhabi|tants. A man from Philadelphia, of the name of Cornell, died in New York, about two days after his arrival. The place of his death was a boarding hou&s;e, in which were a number of boarders, one of whom &s;lept in the &s;ame bed with him. Two of the family only were &s;light|ly affected&mdash;but not in &s;uch a degree as to re|quire medical aid. Three other infected per|&s;ons from our city, who, when di&s;covered, were removed to Governor's i&s;land, died there, and no one took the di&s;order from them. A man died at one of the principal taverns in Bal|timore, of the &s;ame di&s;order. Many people had

A great number of &s;imilar in&s;tances have occurred at Burlington, Bordenton, Lamberton, Princeton, Brun&s;wic, Woodbridge, Newark, Lanca&s;ter, and various other places, and in no ca&s;e, except tho&s;e at Bal|timore and New York, has the infection &s;pread.</P>
<P>The terror that prevailed in Philadelphia, and which was &s;pread through the continent, aro&s;e from the fatality of the di&s;order at fir&s;t, very few of tho&s;e who took it then having e&s;ca|ped. This, with all deference to the medical gentlemen, aro&s;e probably from their being un|acquainted with it. That this was the ca&s;e, is candily acknowledged by &s;everal of the mo&s;t eminent among them. The fact is, that the ter|ror was at no time greater, than about the end of Augu&s;t, at which period, the deaths did not very far exceed the u&s;ual number in that month. When the mortality raged mo&s;t dreadfully, from the middle of September to the middle of October, the public were much le&s;s alarmed, owing to the occurrence of &s;everal recoveries,
<PB N="82" REF="025255_0078_0FCCD92B9B853638">
and their becoming callous by the force of ha|bit. During this time it was, that all the &s;pon|ges, &s;melling bottles, handkerchiefs &s;teeped in vinegar, camphor bags, &amp;c. di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of the police and of &s;ociety in Phila|delphia, appears to no &s;mall advantage, when we con&s;ider one circum&s;tance. Notwith&s;tanding the ab&s;ence of the magi&s;trates, and the immen&s;e value of property left unprotected through the fears of the owners, and the deaths of the per|&s;ons left to take care of it, we have as yet heard of only one or two burglaries committed.&mdash; Another was attempted, but the plunderers were di&s;covered and taken. A hardened villain from a neighbouring &s;tate, formed a plot with &s;ome negroes to plunder hou&s;es. He was a ma&s;ter rogue, had dige&s;ted a complete &s;y&s;tem, and formed a large partner&s;hip for the more &s;ucce&s;s|ful execution of his &s;chemes. However he was &s;oon &s;eized, and the company di&s;&s;olved.</P>
<P>The jail of Philadelphia is under &s;uch excel|lent regulation, that the di&s;order made its ap|pearance there only in two or three in&s;tances, although &s;uch abodes of mi&s;ery are the places
<PB N="83" REF="025255_0079_0FCCEDD4519A5130">
where contagious di&s;orders are mo&s;t commonly generated. When the yellow fever raged mo&s;t violently in the city, there were in the jail one hundred and &s;ix French &s;oldiers and &s;ailors, confined by order of the French con&s;ul, be|&s;ides eighty convicts, vagrants, and per&s;ons for trial; all of whom, except two or three, remained perfectly free from the complaint. Several circum&s;tances have con&s;pired to pro|duce this &s;alutary effect. The people confined are frequently clean&s;ed and purified by the u&s;e of the cold bath&mdash;they are kept con&s;tantly em|ployed&mdash;vegetables form a con&s;iderable part of their diet&mdash;in the yard, vegetation flouri&s;hes &mdash;and many of them being employed in &s;tone cutting, the water, con&s;tantly running, keeps the atmo&s;phere in a moi&s;t &s;tate, while the peo|ple of Philadelphia have been uninterruptedly parched up by uncea&s;ing heat. Elijah Weed, the late jailor, caught the di&s;order in the city, in the performance of the paternal duties to|wards his daughter, and died in the jail, without communicating it to any of the people confined. I hope I &s;hall be pardoned for pay|ing a tribute to the memory of this valuable citizen, under who&s;e government of the jail,
<PB N="84" REF="025255_0080_0FCCEDD5F3F61BD8">
and with who&s;e hearty co-operation, mo&s;t of the regulations in that in&s;titution have been effected, which, with the &s;ucce&s;sful experi|ments made in England, prove that jails may be ea&s;ily converted from &s;inks of human depra|vity and wretchedne&s;s, into places of reforma|tion; &s;o that, in&s;tead of rendering the idle vagrant, confined merely on &s;u&s;picion, or for want of friends to protect him, obdurate, wicked, and ripe for rapine and &s;poil, the profligate and abandoned may leave them in a &s;ituation to become u&s;eful members of &s;ociety. For the honour of human nature, it ought to be recorded, that &s;ome of the convicts in the jail, a part of the term of who&s;e confinement had been remitted as a reward for their peace|able, orderly behaviour, voluntarily offered them&s;elves as nur&s;es to attend the &s;ick at Bu&s;h-hill, and have in that capacity conducted them&s;elves with &s;o much fidelity and tender|ne&s;s, that they have had the repeated thanks of the managers. Among them are &s;ome who were formerly regarded, and with ju&s;tice, as har|dened abandoned villains, which the old &s;y&s;tem was calculated to make every tenant of a jail, who remained there a few weeks. According
<PB N="85" REF="025255_0081_0FCCEDD7AC129F90">
to the &s;ame &s;ummary &s;y&s;tem, the&s;e men's lives would have been long &s;ince offered up as an atonement to &s;ociety for the injury they had done it. That is, in plain Engli&s;h, becau&s;e &s;o|ciety had &s;uffered one injury by rapine, it was nece&s;&s;ary it &s;hould &s;uffer another by law. But by the improved plan, they and great num|bers of others are re&s;tored to &s;ociety and u&s;efulne&s;s once more. So much better, although not quite &s;o ea&s;y, is it to reform men, than to butcher them under colour of law and ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>In the &s;ummer of 1791, the yellow fever pre|vailed in New York, in a part of Water-&s;treet; and in proportion to the &s;phere of its action was as fatal there as it has been here. It began in Augu&s;t, and continued till the middle of September, when it totally di&s;appeared, and has never &s;ince vi&s;ited that place. This &s;hould ea&s;e the fears of many among us, who, always viewing the black &s;ide of every thing, terrify people with their progno&s;tications, that we &s;hall have it again next &s;pring or &s;ummer. All the &s;ymptoms were full as dangerous and alarming in New York, as in Philadelphia. Many per&s;ons died in three days;
<Q>&s;tupor,
<PB N="86" REF="025255_0082_0FCCEDD920D63448">
delirium, yellowne&s;s, the black vomit, and death, rapidly &s;ucceeding each other.</Q>
<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Letter from a phy&s;ician in New York, to his friend in New Jer&s;ey, Federal Gazette, Sept. 21, 1793.</NOTE> It &s;pread no farther at that time, than the one &s;treet, although no precautions, as far as I can learn, were taken to prevent its exten&s;ion. The &s;ame &s;pecies of di&s;order raged in this city in 1762, with great violence. It di&s;appeared in the month of November, and has not from that time until this year vi&s;ited Philadel|phia.</P>
<P>The &s;ummer and fall of this year have been unhealthy in many parts of the union, as well as in Philadelphia. At Lynn, in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, I have been informed, but have no means of a&s;certaining the truth or fal&s;ehood of the re|port, that a malignant fever, not unlike ours, prevailed in Augu&s;t. In many of the towns of Virginia, fevers and agues have been much more prevalent and dangerous then they have been at former periods. Georgetown and its vicinity, which are in general very healthy, lo&s;t,

in the cour&s;e of a few weeks in &s;ummer, an un|exampled number of people by the flux, which di&s;order has raged with great violence in many other places. The influenza has &s;pread general|ly through the union, and been very fatal. It has been twice in Vermont, where likewi&s;e the putrid &s;ore throat has carried off numbers. At Harri&s;burg and Middletown, in this &s;tate, the flux and a putrid fever have been extremely de&s;tructive, and &s;wept away, I am credibly in|formed, a fifteenth part of the inhabitants. Delaware &s;tate, particularly Kent county has &s;uffered much from the flux, which has produ|ced a very great mortality. And various other places have experienced a mortality, very un|common, and which, but for the calamity of Philadelphia ab&s;orbing public attention every where, would have created great alarms and unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Although the proceedings of many people in Philadelphia have been &s;trongly tinctured with cruelty, and a total direliction of every princi|ple of humanity, yet the general conduct has not been &s;o revolting as in London during the plague. In that city, when a hou&s;e was known to
<PB N="88" REF="025255_0084_0FCCEDDC443EEA00">
have an infected per&s;on in it, it was fa&s;tened up, and a guard placed at the door, to prevent any one from coming out, until after a quarantine of 40 days; and if, during that time, any other was infected, a new quarantine was impo&s;ed. Thus entire families fell &s;acrifices to an order, equal|ly &s;en&s;ele&s;s and cruel; and by the&s;e means, dead bodies lay often for weeks together in the mo&s;t dreadful and noxious &s;tate of putrefaction. Such revolting orders exi&s;ted not in Philadel|phia. However, there have been various in&s;tan|ces of hou&s;es being left to the care of a &s;ervant or two, who fell &s;ick, and having no means of communicating their di&s;tre&s;&s;es to the neigh|bours, peri&s;hed for want of a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>I have learned with great plea&s;ure, that a few landlords, commi&s;erating the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of their tenants, have come to the very humane re&s;o|lution of remitting the payment of rents du|ring the prevalence of the di&s;order. Were they to enter into re&s;olutions generally to do the &s;ame, it would reflect honour on them. But there are &s;ome who&s;e hardened hearts know no com|pa&s;&s;ion, and who will have
<Q>the pound of fle&s;h&mdash;the penalty of the bond.</Q>
Indeed,
<PB N="89" REF="025255_0085_0FCCEDDDC2036D38">
when the di&s;order was at the highe&s;t &s;tage, &s;ome landlords &s;eized the &s;mall property of poor roomkeepers, who were totally unable to pay their rent. One man wrote to the com|mittee, informing them that the poverty of his tenants rendered it impo&s;&s;ible for them to pay him; he therefore begged the commit|tee would, as they were appointed to relieve the poor, pay the arrearages due to him. Another per&s;on, a wealthy widow, produced recommendations for &s;everal poor roomkeepers, her tenants; and the committee gave them each a &s;mall firm. As &s;oon as they had received it, &s;he &s;eized the money and their clothes!</P>
<P>As I have been obliged to note a variety of horrid circum&s;tances, which have a ten|dency to throw a &s;hade over the human charac|ter, it is proper to let in a little light on the &s;ubject, wherever ju&s;tice and truth will per|mit. Amid&s;t the general de&s;ertion that prevail|ed, there were to be found many illu&s;trious in&s;tances of men and women, &s;ome in the mid|dle, others in the lower &s;pheres of life, who have, in the exerci&s;e of the duties of humanity, expo&s;ed them&s;elves to dangers, which terri|fied
<PB N="90" REF="025255_0086_0FCCEDDF30646998">
men, who have hundreds of times faced death without fear, in the field of battle. Some of them, alas! have fallen in the good cau&s;e! But why &s;hould they be regretted! ne|ver could they have fallen more gloriru&s;ly. Foremo&s;t in this noble groups &s;tands Jo&s;eph In|&s;keep, a mo&s;t excellent man in every of the &s;o|cial relations, of citizen, brother, hu&s;band, and friend&mdash;To the &s;ick and the for&s;aken, whether he was acquainted with them or not, has he devoted his hours, to relieve and comfort them in their tribulation. Numerous are the in&s;tan|ces of men re&s;tored, by his kind cares and at|tention, to their families from the very jaws of death.&mdash;In various ca&s;es has he been obliged to put dead bodies into coffins, when no other per&s;on could be had to perform that office. An|drew Adgate's merit in the &s;ame way, was con&s;picuous, and of the la&s;t importance to num|bers of di&s;tre&s;&s;ed creatures, bereft of every other comfort. Of tho&s;e worthy men, Wil&s;on, and Tomkins, I have already &s;poken. The rev. mr. Fleming and the rev. mr. Winkhau&s;e, exhau&s;ted them&s;elves by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of labours, day and night, attending on the &s;ick, and mi|ni&s;tering relief to their &s;piritual and temporal
<PB N="91" REF="025255_0087_0FCCEDE0A4702000">
wants. Of tho&s;e who have happily &s;urvived their dangers, and are pre&s;erved to their fellow citi|zens, I &s;hall mention a few. They enjoy the &s;u|preme reward of a &s;elf-approving con&s;cience; and I readily believe, that in the mo&s;t &s;ecret rece&s;&s;es, remote from the public eye, they would have done the &s;ame. But next to the &s;en&s;e of having done well, is, I believe, the approbation of our friends and fellow men; and when the debt is great, and the only payment that can be made is applau&s;e, it is &s;urely the wor&s;t &s;pecies of avarice to withhold it. We are always ready, too ready to be&s;tow cen&s;ure&mdash;and, as if anxious le&s;t we &s;hould not give enough, we generally heap the mea&s;ure. When we are &s;o &s;olicitous to deter by reproach from folly, vice, and crime, why not be equally di&s;po&s;ed to &s;timulate to vir|tue and heroi&s;m, by freely be&s;towing the well-earned plaudit? The rev. Henry Helmuth's merits are of the mo&s;t exalted kind. His whole time, during the prevalence of the di&s;order, was &s;pent in the performance of the works of mercy, vi&s;iting and relieving the &s;ick, comfort|ing the afflicted, and feeding the hungry. Of his congregation, &s;ome hundreds have paid the la&s;t debt to nature, &s;ince the malignant fever
<PB N="92" REF="025255_0088_0FCCEDE229A489A8">
began; and, I believe, he attended nearly the whole of them. To &s;o many dangers was he expo&s;ed, that he &s;tands a living miracle of pre|&s;ervation. The rev. C. V. Keating and the rev. mr. U&s;tick have been in the &s;ame career, and performed their duties to the &s;ick with equal fidelity, and with equal danger. The venerable old citizen, Samuel Robe&s;en, has been like a good angel, indefatigably performing, in families where there was not one per&s;on able to help another, even the menial offices of the kitchen, in every part of his neighbourhood. John Con|nelly has &s;pent hours be&s;ide the &s;ick, when their own wives and children had abandoned them. Twice did he catch the di&s;order&mdash;twice was he on the brink of the grave, which was yawning to receive him&mdash;yet, unappalled by the immi|nent danger he had e&s;caped, he again returned to the charge. I feel my&s;elf affected at this part of my &s;ubject, with emotions, in which I hope my reader will participate. And, as a human being, I rejoice that it has fallen to my lot, to be a witne&s;s and recorder of a magnanimity which would alone be &s;ufficient to re&s;cue the character of man from obloquy and reproach.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="025255_0089_0FCCEDE71A322570">Shall I be pardoned for pa&s;&s;ing a cen&s;ure on tho&s;e, who&s;e mi&s;taken zeal led them, during the mo&s;t dreadful &s;tages of this calamity, to croud &s;ome of our churches, and aid this frightful ene|my in his work of de&s;truction? who, fearful le&s;t their prayers and adoration at home would not find acceptance before the Deity, re&s;orted to churches filled with bodies of contagious air, where with every breath they inhaled, they drew in noxious mia&s;mata?

<P>Of the number of citizens who fled away, it is difficult to form any accurate e&s;timate. In the city, from Vine to South &s;treet, which has been &s;urveyed by a man employed by the com|mittee, of 21,000 inhabitants, the number of ab&s;ent people is &s;tated to be 8600. But as this bu&s;ine&s;s was &s;everal weeks performing, con|&s;iderable variations mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have taken place. The emigration was not fini&s;hed in tho&s;e &s;treets examined in the early part of his pro|gre&s;s, &mdash;and towards the latter part, the immi|gration had been already con&s;iderable. Allow|ing one to balance the other, and the remo|vals in the liberties to have been equal to tho&s;e in the city, we &s;hall probably nor err much when we e&s;timate the number who left the city at about 17,000. This is not &s;o many as I &s;uppo&s;ed when I la&s;t wrote on the &s;ubject<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Independent Gazetteer, October 26.</NOTE>, at which time
<PB N="95" REF="025255_0091_0FCCEDE8804D1660">
I e&s;timated them at 23,000. Which of the two is accurate, or whether either of them is &s;o, I leave the reader to determine.</P>
<P>Some of tho&s;e who remained in the city, have, for rea&s;ons not very ea&s;y to ju&s;tify, been in the habit of reproaching tho&s;e who fled, with criminality, as de&s;erters, who abandoned their po&s;ts<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">If they were even guilty of a crime, it brought its own puni&s;hment; as I am fully convinced that tho&s;e who were ab&s;ent, and a prey to the anxiety cau&s;ed by the frightful reports current, &s;uffered more than tho&s;e who remained. I &s;peak from experience. In a few days ab&s;ence, when the di&s;order had not reached its &s;ummit, I heard more terrific accounts of it, than in as many weeks in Philadelphia, when it raged mo&s;t violen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> off from eighty to a hundred daily.</NOTE>. I believe, on the contrary, that as the nature of our government did not al|low the arbitrary mea&s;ures to be pur&s;ued, which, in de&s;potic countries would probably have ex|tingui&s;hed the di&s;order at an early period &mdash;it was the duty of every per&s;on to avoid the danger, who&s;e circum&s;tances and &s;ituation al|lowed it. The effects of the de&s;ertion were,

moreover, &s;alutary<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Perhaps had all our citizens remained, we &s;hould have had famine added to our calamity; whereas we had plentiful markets during the whole time.
