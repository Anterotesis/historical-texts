At the time when the founder of their &s;tate was born, the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> were cruelly oppre&s;&s;ed by the monarch of <HI>Egypt.</HI> The important &s;ervices which <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> had ren|dered that kingdom were now forgotten; and the po&s;terity of the twelve patriarchs who had been invited to dwell in <HI>Egypt,</HI> upon the terms of friend&s;hip, were, without any provocation, treated with a barbarity which humanity forbids to the wor&s;t ene|mies. God &s;aw and re&s;ented the oppre&s;&s;ion of his people, and the cruelties practi&s;ed upon them by <HI>Pharoah</HI> and his officers. <HI>He, who has made of one blood all nations to dwell upon the face of the earth;</HI> who is the patron of the oppre&s;&s;ed, and who delights to hum|ble exalted wickedne&s;s, e&s;pou&s;ed the cau&s;e of this poor and injured nation, and oppo&s;ed him&s;elf to the tyrant of <HI>Egypt:</HI> and as he had promi&s;ed great and &s;ingular ble&s;&s;ings to the &s;eed of <HI>Jacob,</HI> he remembered his pro|mi&s;e. <HI>I have &s;een,</HI> &s;aid the God of Abraham, <HI>I have &s;urely &s;een the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by rea&s;on of their task-ma&s;ters, and am come down to deliver them.</HI>&mdash;God rai&s;ed up <HI>Pha|roah,</HI> or rather &s;uffered him to ri&s;e, that he might be an illu&s;trious example of his own power and ju&s;tice; and in the plagues which &s;oon after came upon that haughty oppre&s;|&s;or and his people, the world was taught,

<P><HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was the cho&s;en in&s;trument of that deliverance which Heaven had decreed to the po&s;terity of <HI>I&s;rael;</HI> and by him God gave them the mo&s;t important ble&s;&s;ings any people can enjoy;&mdash;a free government, and a divine religion. The <HI>Hebrew</HI> polity is not only one of the mo&s;t antient, but one of the be&s;t civil con&s;titutions that ever the world was ble&s;t with; a con&s;titution wor|thy of it's divine Author, and nicely adapted to pre&s;erve the property, freedom, peace and &s;afety of the people to whom it was given<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The frivolous objections and gro&s;s calumnies, thrown out by &s;ome again&s;t the law of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> have been more than one an&s;wered and expo&s;ed, Mr. <HI>Lowman</HI> has treated this argument to the bottom, in his di&s;&s;ertation on the civil go|vernment of the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> in which, the ju&s;tice, wi&s;dom, and goodne&s;s of the <HI>mo&s;aical</HI> con&s;titutions, are fully vindicated.</NOTE>: and had it been of a contrary na|ture and tendency; had it been calculated for the oppre&s;&s;ion, rather than the general happine&s;s of the &s;ubject, no man would have been oblig'd to believe that it came from Heaven.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="007642_0008_102D9791FB4F9800">
There is a clo&s;e connection between civil liberty and true religion; Tyrants are com|monly equal enemies, to the religious and civil rights of mankind; and having en&s;la|ved the bodies of their &s;ubjects, they affect al&s;o to en&s;lave their con&s;ciences. The peo|ple of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> were made free, in order to their being prepared for the &s;ervice of the God of <HI>I&s;rael;</HI> and without freedom, they would not have been happy, even in the land flow|ing with milk and honey. It was this that compleated their worldly felicity, and ad|ded a peculiar &s;weetne&s;s to all the fruits of <HI>Canaan,</HI> that they entered upon it as their own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and inheritance, and not as the propriety of an ab&s;olute lord.</P>
<P>God had pronounced a ble&s;&s;ing on the &s;eed of <HI>Jacob,</HI> and nothing could hinder this ble&s;&s;ing from taking effect. In vain did <HI>Pharoah</HI> attempt to weaken and de&s;troy them; the people grew and multiplied un|der all their oppre&s;&s;ions; and <HI>Pharoah</HI> him|&s;elf, educates that child in his own court, who was de&s;igned to lead the <HI>Hebrews</HI> from their bondage, and to aba&s;e the pride of <HI>Egypt.</HI> So &s;hort is human fore-&s;ight! &s;o week is human power! and &s;o certainly &s;hall the divine decrees be accompli&s;hed!</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="007642_0009_102D97939EB177B8">
The <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> lawgiver was furni&s;hed with all the great qualities, proper to the public and important &s;ervices, to which he was ap|pointed. He had a princely education from <HI>Pharoah'</HI>s daughter, who had adopted him for her &s;on, as well as a religious one, from his own mother, by whom he was nur&s;ed. <HI>Egypt</HI> was a renowned &s;chool of wi&s;dom, and the fountain of arts and &s;ciences: here, the mo&s;t illu&s;trious men of antient <HI>Greece,</HI> her poets, philo&s;ophers, and legi&s;lators, im|proved their minds, and perfected their &s;tudies; and from this fountain, they drew their learning and their fame. So that when St. <HI>Stephen</HI> tells us, that <HI>Mo&s;es was learned in all the arts of the Egyptians,</HI> he does in effect &s;ay, that he had the be&s;t, and mo&s;t liberal education, that the whole world could afford. The &s;ame divine author a&s;&s;ures us, that <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was mighty in deeds, as well as words; di&s;covering a &s;ingular prudence and firmne&s;s in his conduct, as well as great learning and penetration in his di&s;cour&s;es: and uniting the fortitude of a commander, with the wi&s;dom of a legli&s;lator. Archbi&s;hop <HI>Tillot&s;on,</HI> with many others, &s;uppo&s;es that St. <HI>Stephen</HI> in this pa&s;&s;age, has a reference to the great actions, which, <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> tells us, <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> performed, when he commanded the forces of <HI>Pharoah,</HI> and overthrew a va&s;t army of the <HI>AEthiopians,</HI> that had invaded <HI>Egypt.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="007642_0010_102D9795B01791B8">
But the piety, and public &s;pirit of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> compleated his &s;hining character, and pe|culiarly fitted him to an&s;wer the great de|&s;igns of providence, in the deliverance of <HI>I&s;rael.</HI> The&s;e divine qualities, gave a lu&s;tre to all his other great endowments, and made him happy in a right application of them. What advantage would the <HI>Hebrew</HI> nation have reaped, from his learning, wi&s;dom, and fortitude, had he not been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a generous concern for its welfare? Without this, he might have a&s;cended the throne of <HI>Egypt,</HI> unmoved with the cries of his op|pre&s;&s;ed Brethren, and proved, perhaps, as great a &s;courge to the race from which he &s;prung, as any of the <HI>Pharoah'</HI>s. But God, who de&s;igned him for a deliverer, &s;often|ed his brea&s;t with compa&s;&s;ion, and gave him a benevolence of heart equal to the extent of his capacity.</P>
<P>It often happens, that great and uninter|rupted pro&s;perity hardens the heart: A con&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of gay and plea&s;urable objects, diverts our attention from the mi&s;eries of others; and we too &s;eldom &s;ympathize with them, in tho&s;e calamities which we never felt our&s;elves, and are never like to feel. But the &s;urprizing advancement of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> in <HI>Egypt,</HI> was far from having &s;uch an effect upon him. He did not di&s;dain,
<PB N="12" REF="007642_0011_102D97983B4C82F0">
from the height of his pro&s;perity, to ca&s;t a tender look upon the low and &s;uffering con|dition of his brethren; and after he had lived many years, incircled with all the &s;plen|dors and luxury of the court of <HI>Egypt,</HI> he had not forgot to <HI>weep with them that weep.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mo&s;es</HI> might have been very happy, according to the opinion of tho&s;e, who never knew the force and plea&s;ure of the &s;ocial af|fections, had he ab&s;tracted him&s;elf from his own nation, had he been regardle&s;s of tho&s;e &s;ufferings, from which he was per&s;onally exempt, and been wi&s;e enough, to make him&s;elf the centre and circumference of his own wi&s;hes. He was a favourite in one of the polite&s;t, and mo&s;t magnificent courts, and had the pro&s;pect of being advanced to the head of one of the greate&s;t kingdoms, in the world: for <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> tells us, that as <HI>Pha|roah</HI> had no child, he de&s;igned him for his heir. But <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> could not endure to be happy alone; his heart was too tender, to violate his obligations to God, and his own nation, from any worldly con&s;iderations; and he preferred the &s;oft angui&s;h of com|pa&s;&s;ion for his brethren, to all the plea&s;ures of &s;in. Their welfare, was a dearer object to him, than the crown of <HI>Egypt:</HI> His own pro&s;perity was ta&s;tle&s;s, &s;o long as the lives of the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> were <HI>embittered with hard bon|dage;</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="007642_0012_102D979A3381A758">
"and their groans found a way to his ear, and to his heart, thro' all the mu&s;ic of the court, and all the martial noi&s;e of the camp, in which perhaps he &s;ometimes com|manded." Accordingly he &s;eemed to value his advancement in <HI>Egypt,</HI> only as it might render him a greater ble&s;&s;ing to his people; and made no other u&s;e of it, than to pre|pare him&s;elf, to execute the great purpo&s;es of providence, and to become the &s;aviour of <HI>I&s;rael.</HI></P>
<P>Fir'd with the&s;e noble views, he left the court of <HI>Pharoah,</HI> and ventured to vi&s;it his de&s;pi&s;ed and oppre&s;&s;ed brethren.&mdash;Ob|&s;erving, as he looked upon their burdens, an <HI>Egyptian</HI> ta&s;k-ma&s;ter &s;miting an <HI>Hebrew,</HI> and u&s;ing him with great inhumanity, he warmly re&s;ented the injury.&mdash;Led by a divine impul&s;e, to give a &s;pecimen of that deliverance, which God de&s;igned to &s;end by his hands to the I&s;raelites, <HI>he re&s;cued him that &s;uffered wrong, and &s;lew the Egyptian.</HI> This action, which he perfor|med, not only at the hazard of his court-pre|ferments, but even of his life, was a proof of the generous ardor of his mind, and of his brave re&s;olution, either to redre&s;s the in|juries of his brethren, or to &s;hare their afflic|tions.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="007642_0013_102D979BC1D34CE8">
Having given this in&s;tance of his hone&s;t indignation at the oppre&s;&s;ions of <HI>Pharoah,</HI> which was very ungratefully received, even by his own nation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When one of the two <HI>Hebrews</HI> who were &s;triving together, and whom <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> would have reconciled, thru&s;t him away, &s;aying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us? it is plain, the &s;peech of this &s;ingle per&s;on is repre&s;ented in <HI>Acts</HI> vii. 35. as expre&s;&s;ing the &s;entiments of the whole body of the people; as their &s;lowne&s;s afterwards, to believe the mi&s;&s;ion of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> when atte&s;ted by miracles, &s;eems evidently to &s;hew that it was.

Indeed, when the appointed time of <HI>I&s;rael'</HI>s deliverance was come, and God called <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> to lead in this glorious work, he at fir&s;t, appeared backward to accept the call; which pro|ceeded, not from an abatement of love to his nation, but a mode&s;t &s;elf-diffidence, not rarely found in great minds, and from the hopes, that God might &s;elect &s;ome fitter per|&s;on for this great undertaking. Who am I, &s;aid the accompli&s;hed &s;on of Amram, <HI>Who am I, that I &s;hould go unto</HI> Pharaoh, <HI>and that I &s;hould bring forth the children of</HI> I&s;rael <HI>out of</HI> Egypt? How far was he from being influen|ced by a lu&s;t of dominion! How &s;en&s;ible, that the office of a ruler is not to be &s;ought, for the &s;ake of the external advantages annexed

to it; and ought never to be accepted by any man, but from a &s;en&s;e of duty, and an inclination to deny him&s;elf for the public happine&s;s!</P>
<P>Such an inclination <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> early po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and carried with him, through all the &s;ur|prizing revolutions of his life. With this public &s;pirit he left <HI>Egypt,</HI> and with the &s;ame &s;pirit, he &s;et him&s;elf at the head of his di&s;tre&s;&s;ed people, when he could no longer doubt the appointment of heaven, and re&s;o|lutely di&s;charged the laborious, and hazar|dous duties, of his high &s;tation: With this &s;pirit, he led them out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> not fearing the wrath of the king, who followed clo&s;e at their heels, with a mighty army, threatning their de&s;truction: With this &s;pirit, he con|ducted them in the wilderne&s;s, and &s;hared the hard&s;hips and dangers to which, for many years, they were expo&s;ed, in that inho&s;pitable place: With this &s;pirit, he greatly endured the peevi&s;hne&s;s, murmurings, and provoking carriage of the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> exhibiting an a&s;to|ni&s;hing example of conde&s;cen&s;ion, patience, and tenderne&s;s towards that perver&s;e, and ungrateful people: With this &s;pirit, he fer|vently interceeded with God for them, and &s;tood in the gap, to appea&s;e the anger of heaven, when divine judgments were break|ing in upon them: With this &s;pirit, when

God was plea&s;ed to offer, to make him a greater nation in the room of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> he hum|bly refu&s;ed; and &s;till, earne&s;tly implored the continuance of the divine patience towards that people, preferring their welfare to the dignity of his own family; and even wi&s;h|ing, that his own name might be blotted out of the book of life, rather than they &s;hould fall by the &s;troke of divine ju&s;tice.&mdash;With &s;o con&s;tant, and inextingui&s;hable an ardor for the welfare of his nation, was the brea&s;t of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> lawgiver in&s;pirited! A love &s;trong as death, and which many waters could not quench.</P>
<P>How happy were the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> in &s;o wi&s;e and tender a Leader as <HI>Mo&s;es!</HI> and how happy the people, who are governed by men of the &s;ame di&s;intere&s;ted and public &s;pirit! who con&s;ider the community over which they pre&s;ide, as their own family; who watch over it with a paternal care; who &s;trenuou&s;ly exert them&s;elves for it's welfare, and take plea&s;ure in doing &s;o: who de&s;ire no more power than is nece&s;&s;ary for the good of the people; who zealou&s;ly em|ploy, all which they po&s;&s;e&s;s, for this noble purpo&s;e; and can reli&s;h that happine&s;s as their own, which they communicate to others. This is the &s;pirit with which every magi&s;|trate ought to enter upon his office; which
<PB N="17" REF="007642_0016_102D97A347E1F1C0">
will animate him to the duties, and &s;weeten the cares and fatigues of it; and this, every man profe&s;&s;es who accepts a place of autho|rity. A public character implies a public &s;pirit; without which, it is a badge of in|famy, and not of honour to him that wears it; but when both are united, nothing hu|man can more de&s;erve our e&s;teem and re|verence.&mdash;Nor &s;hould a ruler content him|&s;elf with a &s;mall degree of public affection: there is no danger of exce&s;s in this divine pa&s;&s;ion; and the duties and dangers of an high &s;tation require a double portion of it. For that degree of virtue, that has adorned a private character, has often been found in|&s;ufficient to re&s;i&s;t the charms of power, and the temptations of a more exalted &s;tate. <HI>Tacitus</HI> ob&s;erves, the great change that was made in the temper of <HI>Caligula,</HI> by a change of his circum&s;tances:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Nec meliorem &s;ervum, nec deteriorem dominum.</HI></NOTE> No man, &s;ays he, ever knew a better &s;ervant, nor a wor&s;e ma&s;ter.</P>

But whatever may be advanced in the &s;chool of philo&s;ophy, di&s;intere&s;ted love, is, without all doubt, &s;trongly a&s;&s;erted, and re|commended in the &s;acred writings.

of this epi&s;tle to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> for their faith. From this principle, they hid their infant &s;on three months, not regarding the cruel commandment of the king, which had de&s;|tin'd all the male children of the <HI>Hebrews</HI> to immediate de&s;truction.

This apprehen&s;ion, as well as their great piety, could not but engage them, to give their &s;on a religious education; to in&s;truct him, with peculiar care, in the knowledge of the God of <HI>I&s;rael;</HI> in the pro|mi&s;es made by Him, to the <HI>Hebrew</HI> nation, and the deliverance which they had been taught to expect.</P>
<P>Such an education was not lo&s;t upon <HI>Mo|&s;es,</HI> though from his early youth, he was &s;urrounded with all the temptations of an idolatrous court.

His faith in the perfections,

and providence of God, and his reliance on the divine promi&s;es, made to <HI>Abraham</HI> and his &s;eed, animated him to his public &s;er|vices, and &s;upported him under all the di&s;|couragements with which they were at|tended. This illu&s;trious patriot, <HI>endured as &s;eeing him who is invi&s;ible.</HI> The con&s;idera|tion of an infinitely perfect mind&mdash;pre&s;iding over all events&mdash;making the happine&s;s of mankind the object of his care&mdash;delighting to execute <HI>loving-kindne&s;s, and judgment in the earth</HI>&mdash;and under who&s;e government, only upright and benevolent men, may expect to be finally happy: Such con&s;iderations as the&s;e, confirmed the virtue of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and made it invincible. His faith, being of the <HI>operation of God,</HI> was a living, active prin|ciple&mdash;it a&s;&s;imilated him to the glorious Be|ing, in whom he believed; it formed him to a divine temper; it wrought by love; and impelled him to the execution of all his great and benevolent de&s;igns. The na|tural affection of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> to his nation, was improved, and exalted by faith, into a di|vine vertue. Common humanity, and the dictates of nature, led him to &s;ympathize with the <HI>Hebrews</HI> in their &s;orrows, and to exert him&s;elf for redre&s;&s;ing their wrongs.&mdash;Religion, confirmed the voice of nature; taught him to cheri&s;h the&s;e benevolent in|clinations, and reinforced them, with &s;ome
<PB N="22" REF="007642_0021_102D97AD451CCEB0">
peculiar motives of her own. He had an affection to the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> as they were his own brethren; but they were &s;till more dear to him, as the people of God; the off|&s;pring of that Being, whom he &s;upremely loved; peculiarly related to Jehovah; and for who&s;e welfare <HI>He</HI> had expre&s;&s;ed a parti|cular concern. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> joyfully took part in the reproach of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> becau&s;e he e&s;teemed it the reproach of Chri&s;t him&s;elf; that Angel of the covenant from whom <HI>Jacob</HI> obtained the ble&s;&s;ing; who had taken the &s;eed of <HI>Ja|cob</HI> under his own conduct and patronage; who was <HI>afflicted in all their afflictions;</HI> of who&s;e incarnation, <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> prophe&s;ied; and of whom he was a type.</P>
<P>Thus the public &s;pirit of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> was in|larged, and invigorated by a principle of true religion; in him, the love of God, and benevolence to men were happily united; and by the joint force of the&s;e principles, he &s;upported his great character, and became &s;uperior to the mighty temptations, with which he was encounter'd. His faith taught him to extend his pro&s;pect, far above all pre&s;ent and &s;en&s;ible things, to that glorious recompence of <HI>reward,</HI> which God has laid up in another &s;tate, for upright and good men. While this was full in his view, the &s;ceptre and wealth of <HI>Egypt</HI> appeared but

&s;mall and contemptible things; and he could chearfully re&s;ign, a palace for a cot|tage; royalty for reproach; and plea&s;ure for affliction.&mdash;He could make this re&s;igna|tion, when he was come to years; being pa&s;t the folly of child-hood, and not yet ar|rived to the in&s;en&s;ibility of old-age. The far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory, which was &s;et before him, extingui&s;h|ed the little honors of the world, and &s;weet|ened all the &s;elf-denials, which God called him to endure, for the good of his nation.</P>
<P>Such is the influence of true piety; &s;o certainly does it greaten the human mind, and become the &s;upport of genuine vertue! While it leads us to di&s;charge our duty to God, it gives us a quick &s;en&s;e of our obli|gations to men; and breaks the force of tho&s;e worldly temptations, by which, many are unhappily per&s;waded to violate the&s;e obli|gations.&mdash;Piety adorns every &s;tation of life; but appears with peculiar advantage in the character of a ruler&mdash;It teaches him the right u&s;e of power, and gives an happy direction to the whole of his public conduct.

and benevolence of that Being, to whom he pays his fir&s;t regards. And in &s;uch a con|duct, whatever &s;elf-denial it may co&s;t him, he will certainly at la&s;t, find his own in|tere&s;t. And &s;o we come to con&s;ider in the</P>

Whoever re&s;olutely di&s;charges his duty under the greate&s;t di&s;couragements, and can generou&s;ly deny him&s;elf for the good of others, lays the &s;ure&s;t foundation for his own happine&s;s; and will certainly gain in the end, much more than he parts with at pre&s;ent. Piety and benevolence are, in a good mea&s;ure, their own reward; and the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having done our duty, is in it&s;elf, no &s;mall and contemptible plea&s;ure. A &s;elf-approving mind, and the &s;weet hope of the divine favour, are a trea&s;ure, which is ill exchanged, for any thing that the world has to be&s;tow. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> therefore, &s;hew'd his prudence, in de&s;pi&s;ing the trea|&s;ures of <HI>Egypt,</HI> the magnificence of it's court, and the lu&s;tre of it's crown, when he could not enjoy the&s;e, without forfeiting his allegiance to God, and becoming the

Had he re|nounced his religion, for the riches of this world; had he &s;topt his ears again&s;t the cries of his brethren, and laid the foundation of his own greatne&s;s in their mi&s;ery, he would after all, have procured for him&s;elf but a wretched kind of happine&s;s.

So <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was taken up into the mount with Jehovah; and when he de&s;cended, to bring the divine con&s;titutions to the people whom he had de|livered, he was encircled with a glory that &s;trook the whole congregation of <HI>I&s;rael:</HI> A brighter lu&s;tre, than he could have derived from the diadem of <HI>Egypt.</HI> And &s;o highly was his character at la&s;t revered by the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> that God &s;aw fit to conceal from them the place of his burial; le&s;t their ar|dent affection to their departed deliverer, &s;hould ri&s;e into idolatry; and they &s;hould make the a&s;hes of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> the object of their adoration.&mdash;His memory wanted no monu|ment of bra&s;s, or marble, to perpetuate it: it has liv'd thro' all ages, without &s;uch a feeble &s;upport; and his name has been mention'd with re&s;pect by gentile authors, as well as glo|riou&s;ly di&s;tingui&s;hed in the &s;acred writings.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="007642_0026_102D97BAA3A53E80">
Great minds are very &s;en&s;ible of true ho|nour. They who love the public, cannot but de&s;ire a return of it's affection, and think them&s;elves happy in it. When <HI>Themi&s;tocles</HI> received, at the olympic games, the acknow|ledgments and acclamations of <HI>Greece,</HI> for his public &s;ervices: "When all eyes were turned upon him, and every body was ea|ger to point him out to the &s;trangers who did not know him, as the &s;aviour of his country; he confe&s;&s;ed afterwards to his friends, that he looked upon that day as the happie&s;t of his life; that he had ne|ver ta&s;ted any joy &s;o &s;en&s;ible, and &s;o tran&s;|porting; and that this recompence, which was the genuine fruits of his labours, had exceeded all his de&s;ires."</P>
<P>But the chief reward of piety and public &s;ervice, the glorious recompence which <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> principally re&s;pected, lies beyond the little circle of the pre&s;ent life, and is re&s;erved in heaven. And did we &s;trongly believe the account which revelation gives us of this reward, it would immediately become the fir&s;t object of our wi&s;hes; and we could never doubt, whether it were prudent to procure it, even at the expence of our whole worldly intere&s;t.

<P>To judge rightly of our own intere&s;t, we mu&s;t con&s;ider the future part of our exi&s;t|ence, as well as the pre&s;ent; and what pro|portion time bears to eternity. And, if we extend our views beyond the grave, to that unchanging &s;tate that lies before us, we &s;hall be irre&s;i&s;tably convinced, that nothing is of importance to us in this life, but what will turn out to our advantage in the next. Such a view, will enlarge our minds, confirm our virtuous inclinations, and give us new mo|tives of action; motives, pure and &s;trong, and &s;uperior to all the &s;ollicitations of &s;en&s;e, all the terrors and blandi&s;hments of the world.

<P>FROM the character of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> though too imperfectly delineated in the foregoing di&s;|cour&s;e, civil rulers are reminded of what is required in their own character: what will rai&s;e and adorn it; and give them an intrin|&s;ic worth, an&s;werable to the &s;tation which they fill, and the re&s;pect which they demand from others. From this great example, one of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious that either &s;acred or profane hi&s;tory pre&s;ents us with, they are taught, for what end they are elevated above the common level of mankind; to what purpo&s;e, they are intru&s;ted with their au|thority, and inve&s;ted with their dignity; and what they owe to God, to their coun|try, and to them&s;elves. They are under pe|culiar obligations, as they have &s;ingular op|portunities, to promote the honor of the &s;u|preme ruler of the world; and the good of

And, in the execution of it, they appear glorious in the eyes of men, and acceptable to the infinite|ly benevolent Being, who employs them. As they are in a peculiar manner, the &s;er|vants of God, it is ju&s;tly expected of them, that they do him peculiar honour; that they go before others in a reverence of the divine authority; that they exhibit in their own example, the moral character of the Deity; and make the great end of the divine government, their own ultimate de&s;ign.</P>
<P>And is there not a reciprocal regard due from the people to the civil magi&s;trate? Ought we not to reverence the appointment of heaven; "to be &s;ubject to principalities and powers; to &s;ubmit to every ordinance of man for the Lord's &s;ake; whether it be to the king, as &s;upreme, or unto governors, as unto them that are &s;ent by him, for the puni&s;hment of evil doers, and for the prai&s;e of them that do well?"

When I was made que&s;tor, I looked upon that dignity not as a gratu|ity conferred upon me for my particular u&s;e, but as a depo&s;itum confided to my vi|gilance and fidelity. When I was after|wards &s;ent to act in that office, I thought all eyes were turned upon me, and that my per&s;on and admini&s;tration were in a man|ner exhibited as a &s;pectacle to the view of all the world; and in this thought, I not only denied my&s;elf all plea&s;ures of an ex|traordinary kind, but even tho&s;e which are authorized by nature and nece&s;&s;ity. I am now intended for aedile. I call the gods to witne&s;s, that how honourable &s;oever this dignity &s;eems to me, I have too ju&s;t a &s;en&s;e of it's weight, not to have more &s;ollicitude and di&s;quiet, than joy and plea|&s;ure from it; &s;o much I de&s;ire to make it appear, that it was not be&s;towed on me by chance, or the nece&s;&s;ity of being filled up; but confided de&s;ervedly by the choice and di&s;cernment of my country.</Q> Shall &s;uch examples be found, amid&s;t all the di&s;advan|tages

<P>Suffer me then, honoured Fathers, with a becoming importunity as well as re&s;pect, to remind you of the importance of your public conduct; how deeply the glory of God, as well as the good of the community is concerned in it; and how much your own everla&s;ting intere&s;t depends upon it! a &s;en&s;e of duty to you, by who&s;e order I &s;tand in this place, an affection to my dear coun|try, and a regard to that Being in who&s;e name I &s;peak, all con&s;train me to be in ear|ne&s;t upon this head.

<P>By this motive, as well as a generous af|fection to the public good, may you be guided in the weighty affair that lies before you; teaching us the worth of that privi|ledge which you are now called to exerci&s;e, by a wi&s;e improvement of it.</P>
<P>No one can be in&s;en&s;ible of the importance of his <HI>Maje&s;ty's Council,</HI> this day to be cho|&s;en, and of the influence which that re&s;pec|table Board has upon our public affairs. With their advice the &s;tate is to be &s;teered; with their approbation civil officers are ap|pointed; and the College which ought al|ways to be dear to us, which needs and de|&s;erves to be tenderly cheri&s;hed, falls in part under their in&s;pection. A per&s;on then who is known to be loo&s;e in his morals, and not to hate covetou&s;ne&s;s; one who&s;e capacity will not allow, or who&s;e ba&s;e and cowardly heart forbids him, to give &s;ound and upright advice: one who is indifferent to the inter|e&s;t of learning and religion; and who wants

This is the character, which all who are concerned in the election of this day &s;hould require; and in &s;uch a choice, we pray God, you may be happily united.</P>
<P>We tru&s;t, our civil Fathers, that you are now a&s;&s;embled for the tran&s;action of our po|litical affairs, in the fear of God, and under a deep &s;en&s;e of your dependance for directi|on and &s;ucce&s;s in all, upon him, who giveth wi&s;dom to the wi&s;e, who in&s;pires the gene|rous &s;entiments of the patriot, who pro&s;|pers his endeavours, and rewards his &s;ervi|ces. You have cho&s;en, agreable to the pi|ous cu&s;tom of our ance&s;tors, to enter upon the public bu&s;ine&s;s of this year, perhaps as important an one as we ever &s;aw, with a &s;o|lemn act of religion. You have called us into the hou&s;e of God, to unite with you in imploring the divine ble&s;&s;ing upon your ad|mini&s;tration. Happy will it be for you, happy for this whole community, if you al|ways pre&s;erve a &s;upreme re&s;pect to that glo|rious Being, before whom the principalities and powers in heaven ca&s;t their crowns;

who <HI>&s;tands in the congregation of the mighty;</HI> who knows your thoughts afar off; to whom the happine&s;s of communities is dear; and who&s;e favour you can never expect, without faithfully improving your talents and opportunities for the public good. Like <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> may you endure, by a firm faith in the invi&s;ible God; and lead this people with the &s;pirit of that &s;hepherd and &s;aviour of an|tient <HI>I&s;rael!</HI></P>
<P>Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this &s;pirit, you will a&s;&s;ert and patronize our civil and religious rights; and be concerned to &s;ecure us from dome&s;tic opre&s;&s;ion, and foreign &s;lavery: you will con|&s;ult the genius and temper of the people o|ver whom you pre&s;ide: you will choo&s;e that they &s;hould under&s;tand and reli&s;h the free con&s;titution with which we are ble&s;&s;ed; and endeavour, by rendering their country hap|py, to in&s;pire them with an ardent love to it, and an invincible &s;pirit to defend it. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;pirit of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> you will bear the mi&s;apprehen&s;ions and even ungrate|ful murmurs of the people, &s;hould &s;uch ari&s;e, (which God forbid) with a paternal meek|ne&s;s, and not &s;uffer them to cool your pub|lic affection, or divert you from your bene|volent intentions.

Such a &s;pirit will lead you to pity this people, under our great degeneracy, and the decay of that piety, righteou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;obriety which adorned and ble&s;&s;ed our ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>Touched with this melancholy pro&s;pect, like <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> you will intercede with God for this &s;inful and afflicted people: you will exert your&s;elves for the &s;upport of pure and undefiled religion; and endeavour to revive a re&s;pect to the holy Sabbath, and all the &s;acred in&s;titutions and precepts of chri&s;tiani|ty: you will honor them by your own ex|ample; and employ your authority for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of vice and immorality. In a word, you will be zealous for the glory of God, and go before us in the mo&s;t reverend regards to that Being, who has lately given us very affecting demon&s;trations of his power and dominion, and of his anger at the &s;ins of men, in the amazing EARTHQUAKES that have &s;hook the world; before whom our gracious king, and the whole Briti&s;h nation have lately humbled them&s;elves; and by who&s;e providence we are all loudly cal|led to repentance.</P>

Were the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> affairs either in <HI>Europe</HI> or <HI>America,</HI> ever brought to a more im|portant cri&s;is? Are not our religion, and liberties, every valuable right and enjoy|ment which heaven has indulged to us, threatned by a powerful invader? Are we not &s;truggling hard to maintain our&s;elves in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this good land, the inheri|tance left us, and dearly purcha&s;ed by our fathers? Are not our towns emptied, and our fields uncultivated, while &s;o great a number of our brethren the freemen of this province, are employed in defence of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> rights in <HI>America,</HI> and are now <HI>jeoparding their lives in the high places of the field?</HI> Under all our di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and a|mid&s;t all our dangers, what &s;uccour or &s;ecu|rity can we expect, without the favour of almighty God? But this we cannot hope for, without &s;incere repentance and a gene|ral reformation. And will not you, our civil Fathers, encourage us to obey the call of heaven, and lead us in this important, this mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary work?</P>
<P>If you are &s;ucce&s;sful in your endeavours, as well as earne&s;t in your de&s;ires to revive a &s;pirit of religion and vertue among us, you will render your country the greate&s;t and mo&s;t la&s;ting &s;ervice: for this &s;pirit naturally tends to the public good, and will procure

the divine protection and ble&s;&s;ing, which alone can render our &s;afety and happine&s;s compleat.</P>
<P>In this work of reformation, the mini&s;ters of religion are peculiarly obliged heartily to engage, and &s;trenuou&s;ly to labour. To us it belongs, my reverend Fathers and Bre|thren (you will permit me to remind you of it) to us it belongs, with a cea&s;ele&s;s impor|tunity to intercede with Heaven for our na|tion and land, and <HI>to &s;eek the Lord till be come and rain down righteou&s;ne&s;s upon us.</HI> To us it belongs, to explain and enforce the vocal di&s;pen&s;ations of divine providence from the <HI>lively oracles.</HI> To us it belongs, faithfully to reprove the impiety and immoralities that abound among us; and warmly to urge upon the con&s;ciences of men, the pure pre|cepts, and affecting motives of the go&s;pel. In fine, to us it belongs, as we have any regard to our di&s;tre&s;&s;ed country, any zeal for the honor of our divine ma&s;ter, any hope of being <HI>found of our judge in peace,</HI> to endeavour, both by our example and doc|trine to revive the power of godline&s;s, and to propagate the pure morals of the chri|&s;tian in&s;titution.</P>
<P>And how much does it concern the whole body of this people, not to be deaf to the
<PB N="42" REF="007642_0041_102D97DCAF36E230">
loud admonitions of Heaven; not to neg|lect the &s;ea&s;on, nor re&s;i&s;t the powerful means of repentance, with which we are favoured? May God pour out his &s;pirit from on high upon us, that we all may be formed to the piety and benevolence which the go&s;pel &s;o &s;trongly recommends, and &s;o indi&s;pen&s;ibly requires of us! Then, all would contribute to the common &s;tock of happi|ne&s;s, and every man would find his own, in the public good.

<P>But ala&s;s! there is &s;o little true vertue in the world, that the happine&s;s to which it tends is but imperfectly felt, and the ble&s;&s;ings of &s;ociety do not come to any great maturity, in the&s;e lower regions.
