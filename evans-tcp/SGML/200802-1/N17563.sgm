<BIBL>NEHEMIAH v. 19.</BIBL>
<Q>Think upon me, my God, for good&mdash;according to all that I have done for this people.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE words are the pious ejaculation of one of the fir&s;t patriots who&s;e life adorns the page of hi&s;tory. They are the overflowings of a heart deeply impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of his duty to God, and looking only to the Almighty for a reward for &s;ervices done to a people, who were become dear by the ties of blood, and the bands of religion. They are the devout addre&s;s of no le&s;s a per&s;onage than the truly illu&s;trious Nehemiah, a favourite in the court of the king of Per&s;ia, and cupbearer, an office of honour and profit among the ea&s;tern nations.</P>
<P>A SHORT review of his hi&s;tory and virtues, will lead us to improve the text as the foundation of a di&s;cour&s;e, in which we may pre&s;ent the true pa|triot only in the true chri&s;tian&mdash;portray his virtues as a pattern for all&mdash;and make tho&s;e ob&s;ervations which are proper upon the occa&s;ion of our a&s;&s;em|bling together and wor&s;hipping God on this day; and commending our country, our rulers, and our&s;elves, to his guidance, and holy protection.</P>
<P>NEHEMIAH &s;hines di&s;tingui&s;hed, for his anxious &s;olicitude for his countrymen&mdash;for his liberality&mdash;
<PB N="4" REF="022747_0004_0FBA0F4BA0BD31F0">
di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s&mdash;courage&mdash;uniformity of deport|ment&mdash;and &s;ocial virtues; but, above all, for his piety.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t of the&s;e immediately fired his &s;oul to &s;erve his friends and kindred, as &s;oon as he under|&s;tood the de&s;olate &s;tate of Jeru&s;alem; and he could not &s;uppre&s;s his anxiety, even in the royal pre|&s;ence. The king, vigilant for the felicity of &s;o noble and faithful an attendant, a&s;ks the cau&s;e of his dejection. The an&s;wer is full and &s;ufficient&mdash;<HI>Why &s;hould not my countenance be &s;ad, when the city, the place of my fathers' &s;epulchres, lieth wa&s;te, and the gates thereof are con&s;umed with fire?</HI> How unlike mo&s;t of the world was this man! being in place and pro&s;perity them&s;elves, they forget their be&s;t friends and deare&s;t relatives; they choo&s;e rather to ri&s;e upon the ruin of all the&s;e, than to lo&s;e the enjoyments of a gay court&mdash;the friend&s;hip of a chief magi&s;trate&mdash;a &s;plendid offi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">&mdash;lucrative po&s;t&mdash;and great wealth. E&s;pecially are they greedy to pre&s;erve the&s;e, where they have not the merit requi&s;ite to gain them, as rewards for virtuous and noble actions.</P>
<P>THE liberality of Nehemiah appeared upon all occa&s;ions, particularly when he &s;upported the dig|nity of a governour, at a great expen&s;e, from his own privy pur&s;e; refu&s;ing to accept any reward from the nation&mdash;or even the &s;um which had been paid to tho&s;e who had gone before him in that &s;tation: nay, he proceeded farther&mdash;and, vigilant

over tho&s;e around him, re&s;trained his attendants from committing any plunder or &s;poil, or doing any injury to the people.</P>
<P>HIS courage was di&s;played, when he oppo&s;ed and confronted Sanballat and Tobiah, who were exceedingly grieved when they heard that there was come a man to &s;eek the welfare of the chil|dren of I&s;rael; and when he &s;trengthened the people, by exhorting them to unite their hands in building the walls, that they might no longer be a reproach, and arming them and his &s;ervants:&mdash;So al&s;o he &s;howed a fearle&s;s temper, when he gave a re&s;olute an&s;wer to tho&s;e who would wi&s;h to in|&s;inuate, that he meant to rebel, and &s;et him&s;elf up for the &s;overeign of the country&mdash;<HI>The God of Hea|ven will pro&s;per us, therefore; we his &s;ervants will ari&s;e and build: but you have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jeru&s;alem.</HI> Hearing their &s;coffings&mdash;knowing their malice and &s;ecret plots, he &s;et a watch&mdash;armed the labourers&mdash;and, like an expe|rienced general, gave out his military orders. But a wor&s;e ta&s;k, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;oon devolved upon him, and tried his valour; for amid&s;t all his cares and exertions, there aro&s;e a murmuring among his <HI>own</HI> people, and they and their wives cried to him again&s;t their brethren the Jews, who took the ad|vantage of their di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and &s;trove to make them&s;elves fortunes by involving them in debt, for even the nece&s;&s;aries of life, and then gaining a mortgage on their property, to bring their &s;ons
<PB N="6" REF="022747_0006_0FBA0F4EF2D66F50">
and their daughters into bondage&mdash;pu&s;hing their oppre&s;&s;ion to that extremity, as to put it totally out of their power to redeem them&s;elves, becau&s;e their lands and their vineyards were in the hands of other men: they had been transferred, &s;o as to remove all po&s;&s;ibility of extricating them&s;elves from their embarra&s;&s;ments; leaving them noth|ing but poverty, de&s;pair, and &s;lavery, for the future portion of their lives. Nehemiah, &s;tung to the &s;oul at hearing of all the&s;e evils, &s;oon re&s;olved what to do:&mdash;His hone&s;t heart, emboldened by a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having framed no laws that would &s;creen &s;uch unbecoming conduct, and knowing that he had &s;et a diametrically oppo&s;ite example, encouraged him without delay to rebuke the u&s;u|rious oppre&s;&s;ors, and oblige them to bind them|&s;elves by a covenant, to re&s;tore their unju&s;t gains; and le&s;t they &s;hould attempt to evade or protract this reformation, he called the prie&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> and in their pre&s;ence took an oath for the fulfilment, and &s;hook his lap, and &s;aid, <HI>So God &s;hake out every man from his hou&s;e, and from his labour, that performeth not this promi&s;e, even thus be he &s;haken out and emptied:</HI> and all the congregation re&s;ponded, <HI>Amen,</HI> and prai&s;ed the Lord&mdash;and the people did according to this promi&s;e. But, that demon Avarice could not &s;ub|mit to be thus foiled; and the&s;e nobles of Judah entered into a &s;ecret corre&s;pondence with Sanballat, his enemy, and aided his artful machinations again&s;t Nehemiah&mdash;they &s;pread lies and fal&s;e ru|mours, and hired prophecies, wi&s;hing to terrify

him by di&s;covering his de&s;igns; nay, they had the effrontery to extol the good deeds of his enemies in his pre&s;ence; and in return, like genuine &s;yco|phants, they carried his an&s;wers to their mi&s;chiev|ous employers. But he pa&s;&s;ed firm and undaunted through all the&s;e&mdash;his big &s;oul could not be &s;haken&mdash;his hone&s;t purpo&s;es could not be perverted:&mdash;And who, my brethren, has not &s;een &s;uch conduct, and &s;uch oppo&s;ition ari&s;e, again&s;t almo&s;t every man, from the days of Nehemiah unto this hour, who has attempted to &s;tem the torrent of vice, ir|religion, and oppre&s;&s;ion, and lead others to the performance of tho&s;e things which are right?</P>
<P>HIS indu&s;try is &s;een, when he reconnoitres the walls and ruins, with a few faithful men, by night&mdash;in his appearing in per&s;on, exciting them to their work&mdash;in watching their enemies' motions&mdash;in putting them into a po&s;ture of defence: <HI>We made our prayer to God,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>and I &s;et the people with their &s;words, their &s;pears, and their bows; and I &s;aid unto them, Be not afraid of them&mdash;remember the Lord, who is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your &s;ons and your daughters, your wives and your hou&s;es.</HI> This indu&s;try al&s;o appeared in his attention to the reformation he made in the above|mentioned u&s;urious practices, and to a ree&s;tabli&s;h|ment of religion. To find fal&s;e and treacherous brethren among the Jews them&s;elves&mdash;to contend with men who were enli&s;ted into the intere&s;t of foreigners&mdash;who were bribed into the &s;ervice of
<PB N="8" REF="022747_0008_0FBA0F55C52BF980">
idolatrous neighbours, and wi&s;hed to behold their city and country invaded, in order to give all po&s;&s;ible interruption to Nehemiah and the people&mdash;was employment enough for one man to guard again&s;t: but he mu&s;t be indu&s;trious indeed, who could repel the a&s;&s;aults of apo&s;tate prie&s;ts and fal&s;e prophets, with their frightful, enthu&s;ia&s;tick pre|dictions&mdash;with their feigned reports of meditated de&s;truction from the hands of con&s;pirators and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins&mdash;with their attempts, by artful advice, to lead him to act the coward, to flee for &s;helter to the temple, or put him&s;elf there into a place of &s;afety&mdash;and kindly, though treacherou&s;ly, offering him their company. How excellent was the an|&s;wer of this firm faithful ruler, <HI>Should &s;uch a man as I flee,</HI> (a man in publick &s;tation) <HI>who is there that, being as I am, would go into the temple to &s;ave his life? I will not go in.</HI></P>
<P>HIS uniform deportment &s;hone in all the&s;e ca&s;es; no &s;hiftings; no waverings from his purpo&s;es; no fal&s;e pretences or deceitful excu&s;es, as popular pa&s;&s;ion, clamour, or frenzy&mdash;as ambition, avarice, or &s;pleen, might lead. His eye was fixed upon the darling object of his heart; he abode twelve years by the work before he returned to Per&s;ia; and coming to Judea again, he proceeded in the reformation he had begun, and returning a &s;econd time, he probably devoted the remainder of his life to the &s;ervice of God and his people: all fair means were taken to recover the city from its ru|in;
<PB N="9" REF="022747_0009_0FBA0F56D5CE8118">
and he had the un&s;peakable happine&s;s to be|hold it filled with inhabitants&mdash;adorned&mdash;fortified&mdash;again di&s;tingui&s;hed among the neighbouring nations&mdash;and re&s;tored in a good degree to its former &s;plendour.</P>
<P>HIS &s;ocial virtues appeared, in that benevolent love to his countrymen, which led him, without pecuniary reward or emolument, to begin and ap|pear in his own per&s;on at the head of this noble work; in his re&s;pectful and grateful attention to the king his ma&s;ter; in his ho&s;pitality to tho&s;e whom he entertained daily at his table; in his &s;ympathy for the &s;uffering women and children; and in his regard to the morals of the nation, by his attention to the ree&s;tabli&s;hment of their religion: nay, all the&s;e virtues, and every one of his noble acts, are in reality to be extolled, and can only entitle him to the applau&s;e of God, from his real, unfeigned, and &s;ingular piety&mdash;a piety, which ever led him, as in our text, to appeal to God in ev|ery emergency, and having accompli&s;hed all, to cry, <HI>Think upon me, my God, for good, and &s;pare me according to the greatne&s;s of thy mercy.</HI> Mo&s;t men would have been intoxicated with the &s;ucce&s;s, the applau&s;e, the honour, and affection, which he met with; and been puffed up, with the acclamations, and proofs of gratitude, which the world exhibited to him: but as what he did was for the &s;ervice of God and religion, he preferred the approbation of Heaven before that of men. Humbled under

the love, power, and mercy of God, to &s;inful man, he prays the great Creator and Pre&s;erver of all, to accept his good intentions, and forgive his imper|fections. With the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Ezra he cau&s;ed the law of God to be read and publickly explained to the people, and directed them religiou&s;ly to ob|&s;erve all its rites and precepts, and ordained a &s;ol|emn fa&s;t to a&s;k the ble&s;&s;ing of God. How plea&s;|ing were the &s;en&s;ations of this great man's &s;oul, when he beheld, in con&s;equence of his exertions, &s;ynagogues built through the land, and publick wor&s;hip attended every Sabbath day! From thence the nation ever afterwards maintained the appear|ance of religion, and were pre&s;erved from idol|atry.</P>
<P>HERE we have a mo&s;t ju&s;tly admired per&s;onage&mdash;mo&s;t highly to be extolled: behold him, &s;ecure upon all emergencies, in the hone&s;t and be&s;t affec|tions of his people;&mdash;con&s;tantly ble&s;&s;ed by his countrymen;&mdash;viewing, wherever he turned his eye, the great &s;ucce&s;s of his exertions. He lives rewarded in Heaven with God, angels, and &s;aints, and is enrolled in the fir&s;t cla&s;s of illu&s;trious pa|triots, princes, and &s;tate&s;men, who have lived in the world; and will continue to &s;hine as a pattern to all &s;uch, in the pre&s;ent or future years, unto the la&s;t period of time. That country mu&s;t be ble&s;&s;ed, which lives under the admini&s;tration of &s;uch a man; and that nation mu&s;t be favoured by God indeed, which is ruled by a combination of &s;uch charac|ters,

where &s;imilar worth and virtues are the ex|cellencies that rou&s;e the voice of gratitude and af|fection, and lay honours and profit at their feet, and court and importune their acceptance&mdash;hung o'er with no empty titles, and dazzling by no borrowed lu&s;tre&mdash;cur&s;ed by no injured innocent&mdash;dreaded by no defencele&s;s citizen: &s;uch will live, will ri&s;e and pro&s;per, wherever merit is a jewel, and virtue a pearl of great price; while its ene|mies, pride, in&s;olence, craft, duplicity, and in&s;id|ious &s;miles&mdash;while they would deceive and betray our credulity, that they may gra&s;p us in their arm|ed paw, and cru&s;h us with their devouring jaws&mdash;may make our lives, honour, and pro&s;perity, their &s;port and pa&s;time&mdash;are &s;purned from our pre&s;ence, and bani&s;hed forever from our confidence.</P>
<P>NEHEMIAH is that noble character, in whom we &s;ee the likene&s;s of the beloved Pre&s;ident of the&s;e States. Heaven has, in love, pointed them both to us, as patterns by which to regulate our actions, each in his &s;phere, whether in &s;tations that are &s;a|cred or civil.

<P>UNDER the fulle&s;t impre&s;&s;ion of the importance of all the&s;e great truths and duties, I am author|i&s;ed to ob&s;erve, that in no per&s;on can we find &s;o important a pattern to regulate our lives, to give our characters the fini&s;hing &s;trokes, and become as perfect as is po&s;&s;ible for mortals to be, as in the great Author and Founder of our religion, Je&s;us Chri&s;t the righteous, our great Mediator and Ad|vocate in heaven:&mdash;Nehemiah, and all the renown|ed men, that ancient or modern times ever pro|duced, &s;ink as the &s;tars before the bright luminary that rules the day, when the Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s ari&s;es with healing under his wings, to tho&s;e who fear God and keep his commandments. The great
<PB N="16" REF="022747_0016_0FBA0F699BB333A8">
eternal Word, the Son of God, who came down from Heaven to &s;ave and reform a world lying in &s;in, has di&s;played unto us a glorious pattern of pure&s;t benevolence&mdash;he hath opened a fountain, from which alone we can draw the pure&s;t draughts of that heavenly excellence. The &s;ight of im|pending calamities called forth his tears for his countrymen, tho he was to have no &s;hare in them him&s;elf. His go&s;pel teaches us to love all man|kind. His religion inculcates private friend&s;hip, and publick &s;pirit&mdash;confining both within their due bounds&mdash;expanding our love, not to an indi|vidual or a nation, but to all mankind. We all &s;prang from one common ance&s;tor&punc; to teach us, that as we are all of one blood and one family, &s;o we ought to live in peace and love&punc; and that &s;eas and mountains are not to be viewed as limits to our affection for others. We are all partakers of one common nature, and the mutual benevolence this idea begets, inculcates al&s;o that we love our neighbour who is our image. In this love, is in|volved, the various ties which gratitude and blood join to the bands of &s;ociety; and we are to love our &s;uperiours, inferiours, and equals, &s;o as to pre&s;erve a regard to the honour and felicity of others al&s;o. On this ground, we ro&s;e above the narrow dirty &s;hell of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, and are led to ex|tend our prayers and endeavours for the pre&s;erva|tion and &s;alvation of all; and to watch again&s;t all unlawful incur&s;ions upon others from art, pride, in&s;olence, and arbitrary power.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="022747_0017_0FBA0F6B4F1582E0">
WE have one common country and kindred to provide for; and a little di&s;tance of place, or long ab&s;ence, are not to &s;teel our hearts again&s;t &s;eeking their advantage; and in no better way can we do them a benefit, than by e&s;tabli&s;hing order, protect|ing innocence, promoting virtuous exertions, and &s;paring the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. If we permit immoralities to pa&s;s unhurt, and bad examples to poi&s;on the hearts of others, nothing can compen&s;ate for our folly. True religion makes the real patriot, and the fear of God forms the hone&s;t man, and if we confide only upon pretences to patrioti&s;m and honour, without per&s;onal virtue, experience clear|ly proves, we &s;hall be foiled in our wi&s;hes, and robbed of our rights, whenever ambition, lu&s;t, pride, revenge, or private profit, lead another way. The piety of Mo&s;es, Nehemiah, and others, pre&s;erved their countrymen, when all other things were of no avail. The prayer of the righteous man availeth much. It is the extending and pre|&s;erving of religion, in the&s;e &s;tates, that is acknow|ledged on all hands to be the only &s;afeguard, and bulwark to our liberties. A &s;imilarity of reli|gion, language, and laws, have ever availed much to &s;pread peace and pro&s;perity: and unle&s;s the fir&s;t binds our hearts in love, and re&s;trains our un|ruly pa&s;&s;ions, we &s;hall ever be expo&s;ed to confu&s;ion and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">umult. The pre&s;ervation of a religious, pure heart, is not le&s;s important; but becomes much more &s;o, in a country where all religions are mo&s;t ju&s;tly tolerated, and ought and are promi&s;ed to be
<PB N="18" REF="022747_0018_0FBA0F6CF6BAFC80">
protected; and all are to enjoy every advantage, which law can afford to pre&s;erve, and who&s;e pro|fe&s;&s;ors are each determined to defend and maintain their own privileges. Upon this head, the conduct of our civil rulers in every part of this continent, for many years, has been founded upon the pure&s;t ju&s;tice, and mo&s;t perfect policy, in not only pro|tecting and guarding all from &s;poil and incur&s;ions, but &s;triving to remove all cau&s;e of heartburnings, and jealou&s;ies, by preferring one before another, either by an open or implied partiality; and while it is the duty, it is happy that it is the intere&s;t, of every one to pre&s;erve it. Whil&s;t "the path of true piety is left without any political direction," and we profe&s;s to wi&s;h it to continue &s;o, let us be|ware of infidelity and Laodicean indifference; and &s;how our gratitude to God and our country, and prove our love to religion and its profe&s;&s;ors, by each living up to the rules and profe&s;&s;ions of his own order; and the emulation be, who &s;hall be&s;t know, defend, and practi&s;e the truth; reproving back&s;liders, fal&s;e profe&s;&s;ors, gain&s;ayers, and other countries, for what we &s;uppo&s;e to be defects in them, <HI>by our more pure doctrine, and more perfect life and conver&s;ation.</HI> If we do not prove that we are better men, better chri&s;tians, and more genuine patriots, than foreign profe&s;&s;ors are, in vain have we exulted, and in vain wi&s;h to &s;ee them free al&s;o: if on the contrary, we abu&s;e our liberty to licen|tiou&s;ne&s;s, and an occa&s;ion for &s;in and u&s;ele&s;s inno|vation, we have but promoted mi&s;ery to our &s;pecies,

and our zeal for others will be &s;u&s;pected to ari&s;e from &s;ome evil pa&s;&s;ion within&mdash;or to &s;peak more plainly, if we wi&s;h to &s;ee te&s;t acts repealed abroad, and eccle&s;ia&s;tical power curtailed, let tho&s;e to whom our benevolent words and exertions are extended, &s;ee us living more &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly, and godly, than they&mdash;religion more exten&s;ively propagated by our exertions&mdash;and better &s;upported and at|tended among our&s;elves, than with them.

<P>To the de&s;ire of encouraging the generous prin|ciple of protecting all denominations of profe&s;&s;ors, I attribute the honour done me in calling me to lead the devotions of this day&mdash;and to preach be|fore this a&s;&s;embly. So &s;ingular a proof of chri&s;tian charity and polite attention, in beginning a more equal practice in Newengland, according to the opinion and wi&s;h of &s;o large a part of our coun|try, demands my highe&s;t gratitude. It would, however, be arrogance in me, to a&s;&s;ume this hon|our as done to my&s;elf alone. I am happy to know, and proud to receive it, as a tribute of affection, and good will, to the communion of which I am a member. I declare, their united &s;entiments&mdash;their principles&mdash;their words &amp; actions&mdash;demand, that I thank the honourable the Pre&s;ident and le|gi&s;lature of this &s;tate, for this mark of love, and

And&punc; while our communion are thus noticed, let me a&s;k the &s;ame tenderne&s;s and attention to our chri&s;tian brethren of every name. Good, pious, &s;incere, learned men, are to be found in all communions. In every nation, he that feareth God and worketh righteou&s;ne&s;s, is accepted of him. If God thus extends his care to all, let us not be inattentive to his will, nor appear to limit his mercies or our fa|vours by any unnece&s;&s;ary partialities; or debar them an equal opportunity to inculcate the great duties we owe each other. Morality and virtue are to be encouraged: and it is the glory and intere&s;t of the&s;e &s;tates to cheri&s;h them in every per&s;on, and every &s;hape. Our conduct ought to bani&s;h every idea of &s;uperiority; leaving all, while they are good and peaceable &s;ubjects, to po&s;&s;e&s;s their pro|perty and privileges, without injury or di&s;tre&s;s, and to &s;upport and propagate true religion, as is mo&s;t agreeable to their con&s;ciences.</P>
<P>To help us in our exertions in &s;preading the ble&s;&s;ings of religion, learning, and liberty, in this &s;tate, we are happy to have a flouri&s;hing univer&s;i|ty&mdash;endowed by publick aid, and by the benevo|lent contributions of <HI>all parties</HI>&mdash;by various grants and donations both at home and abroad, and by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance annually given in the &s;ums expended ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> by &s;tudents from <HI>all</HI> religious denominations.

And our academies, and inferiour &s;chools, being placed upon the &s;ame proper and liberal foundation, will derive advantages to them&s;elves, and diffu&s;e exten|&s;ive benefits to the community, which will ever be liable to be lo&s;t by a contrary practice; and &s;hould we ever be &s;o unhappy as to give ju&s;t cau&s;e of jealou&s;y and complaint upon this &s;ubject, which the fir&s;t writers and advocates for the rights of men, both in our country and in Europe, have &s;o often and &s;o boldly taught and inculcated, with all po&s;&s;ible zeal and eloquence; we mu&s;t &s;ully our honour as a nation, our reputation as a &s;tate, and our characters as chri&s;tians. Our youth are ever to be educated with the mo&s;t generous &s;entiments, and ought not, by the early prejudice of education, to be drawn to gain habits of thinking which may check the benevolent love and de&s;ire to &s;erve eve|ry man&mdash;whether his colour, or his creed, accords with that of his own or not. The&s;e youth, in due time, will take the reins in matters both &s;acred and civil; and by a wrong bias may be deprived of advantages to them&s;elves, and prevented doing good to their common country, from influence in early life, that they may lament when too late; and blame the inattention of the influential, who did not &s;ee to it, that they had more enlarged ideas,
<PB N="22" REF="022747_0022_0FBA0F767AD2A7A0">
and more generous &s;entiments; and in con&s;equence behold them&s;elves deprived of tho&s;e plea&s;ing &s;en|&s;ations, and perhaps tho&s;e honours and profits, that generally fall to the &s;hare of the mo&s;t liberally and univer&s;ally in&s;tructed and informed. Should our colleges and &s;chools in America become the pro|perty of religious party, very many of our citizens mu&s;t be &s;ubjected to great inconveniences, and ex|perience real injuries and infringements upon their liberties. A conduct like this would be perverting the principles of the American revolution; it would be laying the charge of innocent blood upon the land, by any method whatever to oblige the &s;ons and de&s;cendants of tho&s;e who fought, bled and di|ed, in the late war, to either remain in ignorance, or be driven to &s;o painful an alternative as to re|ceive an education where any thing incon&s;i&s;tent with equal liberty can affect them&mdash;where neglects, unfair advantages, the influence of in&s;tructors, may warp them from their own, their parents and guar|dians principles.</P>
<P>ANY and every &s;uperiority in matters of religion or education, leaves our patriots and their families and right to depend too much upon the precarious foundation of having them pre&s;erved and defended by tho&s;e who fled from the very dangers in which their predece&s;&s;ors may have lo&s;t their lives&mdash;or to which their cowardice, or &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, might have cau&s;ed them to turn their backs: and making our heroes and &s;tate&s;men but tools to effect party pur|po&s;es, and ab&s;urdly fix &s;hackles upon them&s;elves
<PB N="23" REF="022747_0023_0FBA0F7C0CFB22A8">
and their po&s;terity. Here a thou&s;and thoughts crowd up|on the mind, and draw forth the wi&s;h, to &s;ee the in&s;truc|tion of our youth more generally under the publick care than at pre&s;ent, that we may not tremble for any of them, le&s;t they lo&s;e tho&s;e benefits in life, which their fathers pur|cha&s;ed with their deaths. Per&s;ecution con&s;i&s;ts in depriving us of any right or hone&s;t enjoyment in life becau&s;e of our religious tenets; and is found in the licentious tongue&mdash;in the a&s;&s;ault upon the per&s;onal character&mdash;and in all the &s;hapes in which men tyrannize over each other's con|&s;ciences. It may be found as di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to our felicity, and dangerous to our rights, in other things, as in the inqui&s;ition of Spain and Portugal: and while we &s;trive to gain emancipation for &s;laves, we are to beware how we per&s;ecute freemen. When at the clo&s;ing &s;cene of life&mdash;when all things appear real&mdash;a long &s;eries of actions are to be reviewed; and among&s;t others, we &s;hall examine how we have performed our duty to our neighbours, and particularly our general duties to &s;ociety: how exqui&s;ite mu&s;t be the &s;en&s;ation of the real chri&s;tian and patriot, who has contributed to do good&mdash;to reform the manners&mdash;and pre&s;erve men in a ju&s;t regard to each other's felicity! He can call upon God, <HI>Think upon me, for good, according to all that I have done for this people:</HI> &s;ealing his will&mdash;his lips&mdash;and his life&mdash;with this &s;entiment; as Nehemiah does his book.</P>
<P>THIS day we &s;ee you, our civil fathers, collected to|gether upon that all-important bu&s;ine&s;s, the attendance upon the civil and religious concerns of this people, in a thou&s;and forms&punc; may God pro&s;per your con&s;ultations, for the promotion of his glory, and the good of every in|dividual in this &s;tate. To be called <HI>fathers,</HI> is the mo&s;t honourable epithet we can be&s;tow upon the benefactors of our &s;pecies&mdash;and to be <HI>political fathers,</HI> is the endearing term which we tru&s;t our rulers in the&s;e &s;tates will ever con&s;ider as the highe&s;t expre&s;&s;ion of love and veneration, that can be paid to them by us, her citizens.</P>

IN Nehemiah, I have depicted the leading traits in &s;o important a character: he was a father indeed to the nation of the Jews&mdash;and was ever father more gratified by the &s;ucce&s;s of his labours and cares?&mdash;May &s;imilar enjoy|ments and honours be the &s;hare of the beloved Pre&s;ident of this &s;tate&mdash;of each of the members of this legi&s;lature&mdash;of every officer in this government&mdash;and of every one, who, in his &s;phere as a per&s;on in &s;acred, civil, or private life, is &s;triving to make our country pro&s;perous.</P>
<P>NEHEMIAH did not accompli&s;h his errand without pi|ou&s;ly following God's own in&s;tituted mode, and calling in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Ezra, a mini&s;ter and prophet of the Lord, and that of the prie&s;ts:&mdash;and it is happy for us in this country, that a &s;imilar aid is to be had from the min|i&s;ters of religion, and the teachers of virtue and morality, among chri&s;tians of every name. Their office, their pi|ety, zeal, learning, and example, will gladly be afforded upon all occa&s;ions, to enforce our duties to God and man, and e&s;pecially the nece&s;&s;ity of obedience to the civil ma|gi&s;trate. With &s;uch united &s;trength, the power of the people expre&s;&s;ed by the acts of their repre&s;entatives, and the influence of religion di&s;played in the lives and doctrines of &s;piritual guides, we may look forward to happy times on earth, and for rewards and joys in Heaven. May we all, in our &s;tations, remember and practi&s;e upon the precepts and examples of the great Founder of our religion, and Author of our &s;alvation; and never forget to imitate Abraham, Mo&s;es, Nehemiah, and the renowned of ancient and modern times, who have &s;hone as fathers and benefactors in their day unto our race. But may we every day do &s;omething for the good of others, and by our piety to God, obtain his applau&s;e at la&s;t, and &s;it down with Abraham, I&s;aac, and Jacob, with patriarchs, proph|ets, and apo&s;tles, in the kingdom of Heaven, enjoying the fulle&s;t draughts of love and benevolence, from God the Father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the God and Father of the &s;pirits of all fle&s;h&mdash;hearing no voice, thro the boundle&s;s realms of being, but the voice of love; under who&s;e meek but powerful influences, may all the kingdoms of the earth become the kingdoms of the Lord, and his Chri&s;t.</P>
