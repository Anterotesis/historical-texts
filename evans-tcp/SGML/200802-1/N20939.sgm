<P>That an exact li&s;t be obtained of the daily burials in each ground in this city and vicinity.</P>
<P>From accounts received from different quarters of the city, it is evident that the di&s;order now raging, has for the la&s;t week been more general and alarming than at any time &s;ince its appearance&mdash;its greate&s;t height being about the 12th, the mortality at the Ho&s;|pital al&s;o at that period, being greater than at any o|ther time.</P>
<P>Whether it is owing to the extreme malignancy of the di&s;ea&s;e, neglect, or delay of &s;ending the patients to the Ho&s;pital in the early &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e can|not be determined; it is remarkable that the greater part of tho&s;e who die, terminate their exi&s;tence with|in three days after their admi&s;&s;ion, many on the next day after, and frequent in&s;tances occur of their dy|ing on the pa&s;&s;age to the Ho&s;pital.</P>

That from the frequent applications for admi&s;&s;ions, it was nece&s;&s;ary to procure a more commodious place, which, by direction of the committee they obtained.

The hou&s;e was par|ticularly calculated on account of its &s;ituation and the height of its cicling, for the purpo&s;e of my works; I had made &s;ome repairs to the windows and a clo&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> in the garret, and in order better to &s;ecure the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the hou&s;e&mdash;I have paid forty eight dollars, or one half years rent, before hand: but knowing that private convenience and emolument mu&s;t always give way to public utility and particularly at a time of general cala|mity as the pre&s;ent is, I thought it my duty to &s;ubmit

<P>The committee on admi&s;&s;ions and burials <HI>Report,</HI> that they have not admitted or buried any, except the orphan abovementioned.</P>
<P>The committee on di&s;tributions <HI>Report,</HI> that they have relieved one hundred and &s;eventy two families: di&s;tributed one hundred and twenty eight dollars and &s;eventy five cents, twelve and a quarter cords of wood, and two hundred and ninety loaves of bread.</P>
<P>The return of health to the city affording much con|&s;olation to the committe, it was on motion <HI>Agreed,</HI> to cau&s;e the following communication to be printed for the information of our fellow-citizens.</P>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>After the long continued di&s;tre&s;s with which our city hath been afflicted, the committee have the happi|ne&s;s to congratulate their fellow-citizens upon the re|turn of as great a degree of health, they unanimou&s;ly believe, as u&s;ually prevails at this &s;ea&s;on of the year.</P>
<P>They have heard of no new ca&s;es in the malignant fever for many days; and they have great rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that there will not remain any ve&s;tige of it in the city or &s;uburbs after a few days.</P>
<P>Applications for admi&s;&s;ion to the ho&s;pital at Bu&s;h-Hill have cea&s;ed; Of ninety one patients who &s;till re|main there, the phy&s;icians are not apprehen&s;ive of lo&s;|ing above three or four: The convale&s;cents increa&s;e daily.</P>
<P>Among the great number of our citizens who re|tired to the country, it doth not appear that one of them hath been attacked by the di&s;order &s;ince their re|turn;
<PB N="121" REF="027501_0122_0FD491D49DAE3C70">
reports to the contrary have been circulated, which upon inve&s;tigation have proved to be fal&s;e.</P>
<P>Purifying the hou&s;es where the di&s;order hath been, is e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to prevent future in|fection. The committee think it incumbent upon them to repeat to their fellow-citizens, and to urge in the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing manner, the performance of this impor|tant duty.</P>
<P>Clothing, either for the body or beds, which hath been made u&s;e of by the &s;ick, and more particularly for tho&s;e who have died of the di&s;order, &s;hould be wa&s;h|ed, baked, buried or de&s;troyed. The lo&s;s which would attend a total de&s;truction, will not, it is hoped, be put in competition with the life or health of an individual, much le&s;s with tho&s;e of the community.</P>
<P>The committee are of opinions, that our fugitive brethren, as well as others, who have bu&s;ine&s;s to tran&s;|act, may &s;afely come to the city, without danger from the late prevailing di&s;order.</P></Q>

<P>At what time and place did the di&s;order make its appearance; and to what quarters of the city did its ravages extend?</P>
<P>How many citizens have died &s;ince the commence|ment of the di&s;order; how many recovered, who had been afflicted with it; and what number of orphans have been deprived of their parents on this occa&s;ion?</P>
<P>What accommodations and &s;upplies were provid|ed for the &s;ick and poor; what monies have been di&s;|bur&s;ed, and what debts have been incurred?</P>

<P>The committee for the relief of the &s;ick and poor of the city of Philadelphia, in reply to the &s;everal que|ries propo&s;ed to them by the Governor, an&s;wer;</P>
<P>To the fir&s;t:</P>
<P>That the malignant di&s;order, by which &s;o many of our citizens have been taken off, made its fir&s;t appear|ance about the latter end of July, in Water Street.</P>
<P>Its ravages were for &s;ome time confined to that &s;treet, between Mulberry and Sa&s;&s;afras &s;treets; from thence it extended northwardly up Water &s;treet to Vine Street. Front &s;treet, within the above limits, was next attacked, whence it &s;pread into the parallel &s;treets, up tho&s;e which run Ea&s;t and We&s;t; the greate&s;t ha|voc being neare&s;t the river Delaware, and becoming
<PB N="128" REF="027501_0129_0FD4921B85444058">
more feeble in its progre&s;s to the We&s;tward; this will more clearly appear from the account of the number of hou&s;es, &amp;c. in the different &s;treets, lanes and al|l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ys in the city and &s;uburbs, hereunto &s;ubjoined.</P>
<P>To the &s;econd:</P>
<P>The committee have procured pretty accurate li&s;ts from the &s;everal burial grounds in and about the city, of the interments from the fir&s;t day of Augu&s;t to the ninth day of November; from the&s;e it appears that Four thou&s;and and thirty one per&s;ons, of all ages, &s;ex|es and di&s;orders, have been buried during that pe|riod:</P>
<P>It is impracticable to di&s;criminate the number taken off by the malignant di&s;order, no accounts having been kept by the &s;extons, or other per&s;ons, to whom the re|gi&s;tering of burials was committed, except in two in|&s;tances, viz. in the burial grounds belonging to Chri&s;t-Church and St. Peters.</P>
<P>There are no data from which the committee can form a calculation as to the number of tho&s;e who hav|ing been afflicted with the di&s;order, have recovered.</P>
<P>The committee have received into their care &s;ince the commencement of the di&s;order, one hundred and ninety one children, who have either lo&s;t one or both of their parents and the &s;urvivors being &s;ick or &s;o much reduced in circum&s;tances as to render the attention of the committee ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The whole number admitted into the orphan-hou&s;e, and the pre&s;ent &s;tate of it is as follows, viz.</P>
<P>Admitted one hundred and ninety one: Died &s;e|venteen: Returned to their friends forty nine: There remain one hundred and twenty five, of which at pre|&s;ent
<PB N="129" REF="027501_0130_0FD491DED2FB0DF8">
there are in the hou&s;e eighty one, and of infants at nur&s;e forty four.</P>
<P>The committee are &s;o much affected by the &s;ituation of the orphans under their care, that they beg leave to recommend them in a particular manner to the Gov|ernor's notice.</P>
<P>To the Third:</P>
<P>At the fir&s;t appearance of the di&s;order the general con&s;ternation was &s;o great, that tho&s;e who&s;e particular province it was to take care of the poor, knew not how to act; terror &s;oon put them all to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">light, except three, who&s;e exertions merit the highe&s;t encomiums; worn down with fatigue, a call was made upon the be|nevolent citizens to come to their aid, a meeting of a few took place, who voluntarily offered their &s;ervices in the dangerous undertaking. A &s;econd meeting was obtained, when a committee con&s;i&s;ting of twenty &s;e|ven per&s;ons was appointed the majority of whom un|dertook the ta&s;k, but from death and other cau&s;es the bu&s;ine&s;s was principally conducted by twelve only. This committee formed them&s;elves into &s;ub-commit|tees to whom different parts of the bu&s;ine&s;s was a&s;ign|ed&mdash;One of which undertook the extreme hazardous part of attending at and managing the ho&s;pital at Bu&s;h-Hill; Another to receive applications for the removal of the &s;ick to the ho&s;pital, and of burying the dead.</P>
<P>The great increa&s;e of deaths &s;oon left a number of children without parents or friends to whom to apply for protection; &s;ome of tho&s;e were found in the hou&s;es from whence their parents had ju&s;t been remov|ed to the &s;ilent grave, deploring their lo&s;s in the great|e&s;t agonies of di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="027501_0131_0FD4921D112F5678">
A committee was appointed to provide a hou&s;e for their reception; a matron and nur&s;es were employed.</P>
<P>As the effects naturally re&s;ulting from the accumu|lated di&s;tre&s;s of the more indigent citizens, many of them were reduced to &s;uch a &s;ituation as to require im|mediate &s;upplies of the nece&s;&s;aries of life.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e another committee was appointed, who have for &s;everal weeks pa&s;t daily di&s;tributed to about two hundred families, for one week's &s;upport, of the following articles, which have amounted upon an average to four hundred and forty loaves of bread, fifteen cords of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ood, one hundred and fifty dollars in money, per day, be&s;ides meat, meal, vegetables, &amp;c.</P>
<P>A number of citizens undertook to act as an ASSIS|TANT COMMITTEE in recommending &s;uitable objects for tho&s;e &s;upplies.</P>
<P>The whole amount of di&s;bur&s;ements for the various objects already mentioned is not le&s;s than Twenty thou|&s;and dollars; the particulars, cannot yet be a&s;certained with preci&s;ion.</P>
<P>To the Fourth:</P>
<P>The charitable contributions already received in mo|ney amount to Twenty two thou&s;and dollars. Some of our fellow-citizens, individuals of the committee, before it was known that one dollar would be contri|buted by donations, borrowed upon their per&s;onal &s;e|curity of the Bank of North America, &s;ix thou&s;and five hundred dollars; others of our fellow-citizens have &s;ince &s;igned a guarantee to that bank, to make good the amount of fifteen thou&s;and dollars, if the committee &s;hould have occa&s;ion for further loans.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="027501_0132_0FD491E04B7DB238">
The committee having thought it a mea&s;ure ex|tremely requi&s;ite in order to purify the city from the latent infection, that re&s;pectable citizens &s;hould be re|que&s;ted to undertake the trouble of going to every hou&s;e where any per&s;on had been &s;ick, or in which any had died of the di&s;order, to recommend it to the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ors, to cau&s;e them to be opened and thoroughly clean&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Gentlemen who had before undertaken to act as an ASSISTANT COMMITTEE, cheerfully added this to their labours; they have made con&s;iderable progre&s;s in the bu&s;ine&s;s, and by their exertions will undoubtedly execute it in the mo&s;t &s;atisfactory manner, as far as their influence can extend. There are &s;ome refracto|ry per&s;ons who either in&s;en&s;ible of the danger to which them&s;elves and their fellow citizens may be expo&s;ed from a non-compliance, or from ob&s;tinacy, occa&s;ion &s;ome difficulty. It is hoped that this, as well as prop|er means to cau&s;e all infected clothing, and more e&s;pe|cially beds and bedding, to be purified or de&s;troyed, will attract the Legi&s;lative attention.</P>
<P>The precautions nece&s;&s;ary to be taken to guard a|gain&s;t a &s;imilar calamity in future, will require much con&s;ideration. The committee are of opinion that a health-officer, upon a more exten&s;ive plan than the pre|&s;ent, is of the greate&s;t importance, and that the re&s;i|dence of the officer and phy&s;icians &s;hould be at a &s;uit|able di&s;tance below the city.</P>
<P>That a healthful &s;pot for the &s;ite of an ho&s;pital, nearly contiguous to the city, ea&s;ily acce&s;&s;ible by land and water, together with requi&s;ite buildings for the accommodation of tho&s;e who may be attacked by ma|lignant
<PB N="132" REF="027501_0133_0FD4921E812F8338">
di&s;orders in future, are among the mo&s;t nece&s;|&s;ary means for the purpo&s;e of prevention.</P>
<P>From the want of &s;uch a place, to which the &s;ick might have been removed, at an early period of the late di&s;order, may be a&s;cribed the great terror which incapacitated the inhabitants from giving that a&s;&s;i&s;tance to their fellow-citizens, by which many hundred lives might have been &s;aved.</P>
<P>The increa&s;ing trade of the city, and the great num|ber of people who are daily arriving from all parts of the world, expo&s;e us to every &s;pecies of infection that prevails in other places, the nece&s;&s;ity of efficient mea|&s;ures being immediately taken to guard again&s;t future dangers become therefore indi&s;pen&s;ible.</P>

<P>As a manager of the Ho&s;pital at Bu&s;h-Hill and the one who organi&s;ed that in&s;titution, I think that as we are advancing toward the moment of clo&s;ing the bu&s;i|ne&s;s intru&s;ted to our care by our fellow-citizens, it is my duty to &s;tate to you my ideas upon that &s;ubject <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the following manner:</P>

<P>FIFTH. That the committee will take into their con&s;ideration the &s;ervices which Mrs. Mary Saville, matron of &s;aid Ho&s;pital, has rendered to our &s;ick bre|thren in that in&s;titution, and make to this valuable woman &s;uch compen&s;ation as they &s;hall think adequate to her merit.</P>
<P>SIXTH. That a &s;ufficient &s;um of money be imme|diately borrowed, either from the banks or private ci|tizens, in the name of the committee, for the purpo&s;e of paying and di&s;charging every debt, &amp;c. relative to the Ho&s;pital of Bu&s;h-Hill, and contracted by the com|mittee &s;ince the 16th of September la&s;t.</P>

<Q><PB N="185" REF="027501_0186_0FD49C79D5CE8CD0">

<DIV1 TYPE="report">
<P>HAVING been appointed a Committee on the 14th of September la&s;t, at a meeting of the citi|zens, called by the Mayor, for the purpo&s;e of alle|viating the &s;ufferings of our fellow-citizens, who were labouring under the afflicting &s;ickne&s;s, which then prevailed; we have reque&s;ted your attendance, in or|der briefly to report to you our proceedings; referring you for more particular information to our minutes, which are in the pre&s;s, and to our accounts, now pro|duced for your in&s;pection.</P>
<P>Upon entering on the duties of our appointment, we found many families of the poor &s;truggling under di&s;ea&s;e and want. And that the hou&s;e of William Hamilton, at Bu&s;h-Hill, which had been taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on of, and converted into an ho&s;pital, for their accom|modation, contained &s;everal &s;ick per&s;ons in a deplora|ble &s;ituation. Two of our members offering their &s;er|vices to &s;uperintend that in&s;titution, they were appoint|ed managers thereof, and by their exertion and attention it was conducted with order and regularity. About one thou&s;and per&s;ons were removed to it (in carriages provided for the purpo&s;e) and &s;upplied with every re|qui&s;ite, to render them comfortable, that the exi|gency of the times and our &s;ituation would admit of.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the great mortality which prevail|ed there, we think our&s;elves warranted in the belief, that much di&s;tre&s;s was prevented and the &s;ufferings of many greatly alleviated. We cannot with propriety omit informing you, that the tenderne&s;s and care ex|erci&s;ed by Mary Savill (the matron of the ho&s;pital) to the &s;ick, were &s;uch as intitles her to your generous no|tice.</P>

The extreme di&s;tre&s;s to which many families were reduced rendering it impo&s;&s;ible for them to procure the interment of their decea&s;ed connections, it became one of our mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing duties to provide for the bu|rial of &s;uch per&s;ons, and therefore we procured coffins and carriages, and employed &s;uitable per&s;ons to attend to this mournful part of the &s;ervice.</P>
<P>In the progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e, many children were bereft of their parents, and the general di&s;tre&s;s pre|venting individuals from attending to their expo&s;ed &s;i|tuations, we were impelled to take charge of &s;uch or|phans, and of cour&s;e it became nece&s;&s;ary to provide a a &s;uitable hou&s;e, with a matron and attendants and a number of wet nur&s;es This was done and the whole placed under the direction of four of our members e&s;peci|ally appointed for that purpo&s;e: of one hundred and ninety-two of the&s;e helple&s;s innocents, who came un|der our care, ninety-four have been reclaimed by their friends, twenty &s;even have died, and &s;eventy-one yet remain; on who&s;e behalf we have applied to the Legi&s;|lature, but as they have not come to a determination on our application, we therefore earne&s;tly recommend the&s;e orphans to your immediate attention.</P>
<P>The calamitous &s;tate of the city cau&s;ed an univer&s;al &s;tagnation of bu&s;ine&s;s and increa&s;ed the number of the indigent &s;o much, that in order to obtain a knowledge of their real &s;ituation and guard again&s;t impo&s;ition, in relieving their wants, we found it nece&s;&s;ary to call for a&s;&s;i&s;tance; when a number of re&s;pectable inhabitants of the city and &s;uburbs came forward to our aid, under the title of the A&s;&s;i&s;tant Committee, who rendered very e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice by recommending &s;uitable objects; which facilitated the di&s;tribution of money, provi&s;ions

and firewood, from the 14th October to the 23d No|vember, to upwards of one thou&s;and families, weekly.</P>
<P>The&s;e different operations requiring con&s;iderable funds, and the major part of the over&s;eers of the poor, as well as mo&s;t of the officers of government and police being removed; recour&s;e was had to the pre&s;ident and directors of the bank of North-America, who cheer|fully accommodated us with &s;ix thou&s;and five hundred dollars; which we have been enabled to repay by the &s;ub&s;equent liberality of our fellow citizens of this and other &s;tates, who&s;e donations to us have amounted to twenty nine thou&s;and and eighty five dollars &s;eventy &s;even cents, be&s;ides which we have received 5316 dol|lars, 32 cents, for &s;undries mentioned in our accounts; which &s;ums fall &s;hort of that expended by us, three thou&s;and two hundred and forty five dollars twelve cents.</P>
<P>The mode of &s;upplying this deficiency you will doubtle&s;s conceive to be a part of the bu&s;ine&s;s of the pre&s;ent meeting.</P>
<P>As no public provi&s;ion is made in ca&s;e we &s;hould be vi&s;ited with a &s;imilar affliction (to which all great com|mercial cities are expo&s;ed) it was deemed e&s;&s;ential, af|ter compen&s;ating the proprietor of Bu&s;h-Hill for the u&s;e made of his property, to &s;ecure a re&s;ort to it again, &s;hould it be found nece&s;&s;ary, before the 25th of March, 1795; this was done and it is &s;till in our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion&mdash;wherein are depo&s;ited &s;uch articles as remain on hand belonging to the Ho&s;pital. The appropriation of the&s;e articles is an object which will claim your attention.</P>
<P>The con&s;ideration of the propriety of e&s;tabli&s;hing an Ho&s;pital in the neighbourhood of this city, for per&s;ons afflicted with infectious di&s;ea&s;es, which at the time of our appointment was referred to us, would have claim|ed
