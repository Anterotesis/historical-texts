<P>ELI, the chief of his tribe and prie&s;t of the temple in Shiloh, was him&s;elf a pious and good man. He &s;eriou&s;ly performed the duties of his of|fice, and di&s;covered a &s;olicitude to promote the in|tere&s;t of religion. In his own life he &s;et a good example, and gave the be&s;t advice to tho&s;e who a&s;&s;embled around the altar of the Lord; but he fail|ed in the government of his family. He trained not his &s;ons to walk in his &s;teps; and to obey the commands of their God. He gave great|er latitude of indulgence to their pa&s;&s;ions and de|&s;ires, than is con&s;i&s;tent with the rules of virtue. He did not, with becoming zeal and authority, cor|rect the commencement of their evil practices, but connived at their impiety, and they became &s;ons of Belial. The confidence and the power repo&s;ed in them, as the attendants of the altar, they abu&s;ed to the vile&s;t purpo&s;es. In&s;tead of leading in the devo|tions

of the people, in&s;tead of pure examples and amiable manners&punc; to per&s;uade their countrymen to walk in the paths of religion, they u&s;ed the influence of their &s;tation, to corrupt their minds and allure them to the paths of folly and vice. At a late period, Eli warned his &s;ons of their danger, and admoni&s;h|ed them to reform their practices. "He &s;aid unto them, &iquest; Why do ye &s;uch things? For I hear of your evil doings by all this people. Nay, my &s;ons; for it is no good report that I hear; ye make the Lord's people to tran&s;gre&s;s. If one man &s;in again&s;t an|other, the judge &s;hall judge him; but, if a man &s;in again&s;t the Lord, &iquest; Who &s;hall entreat for him?" But alas! the authority of the parent was lo&s;t, the habit of &s;in was e&s;tabli&s;hed, admonition and coun|&s;el were ineffectual. The father him&s;elf &s;uffered for his early neglect in the education of his children. His declining years were rendered joyle&s;s by the knowledge of their malpractices, and the prophet of the Lord was commi&s;&s;ioned to carry to him the predictions of the &s;ignal de&s;truction of his &s;ons, and of the tran&s;lation of the prie&s;thood from his family. A &s;imilar me&s;&s;age was delivered by the youthful Samuel: "I have told him, that I will judge his hou&s;e, for the iniquity which he knoweth; becau&s;e his &s;ons made them&s;elves vile and he re|&s;trained them not." When Eli heard this di|vine denunciation, he murmured not, but in grief he acquie&s;ced. "It is the Lord; let him do what &s;eemeth him good." This afflicted man filled up the full mea&s;ure of his days, he attained to ninety and eight years, his eyes failed through age, his limbs

were almo&s;t incapable of motion; but he &s;till felt anxiety for the intere&s;ts of his country. The I&s;rael|ites were at war. His &s;ons were gone forth to bat|tle, and the ark of God was conveyed to the field of action. Impatient to hear from the camp, he &s;at by the way&s;ide. Tidings were brought of the defeat of the army, and the city was in an uproar. The tumult reached the ears of the aged prie&s;t, and with deep anxiety he it daired the cau&s;e. The me&s;&s;enger approached him and &s;aid: "I am he that came out of the army, and I fled today out of the army. And he &s;aid, &iquest; What is there done, my &s;on? And the me&s;&s;enger &s;aid, I&s;|rael is fled before the Phili&s;tines, and there has been al&s;o a great &s;laughter among the people, and thy two &s;ons, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken." A train of horrid ideas crowded upon the mind of the enfeebled prie&s;t.&mdash; The &s;laughter of the people&mdash;the accompli&s;hment of the prophecy again&s;t his own hou&s;e&mdash;and the cap|ture of the ark. The &s;hock was more than he could bear. He fell backward from his &s;eat, and by the fall he parted with his life and his troubles.</P>
<P>The words before us I have cho&s;en, as a &s;uita|ble theme for a di&s;cour&s;e, on the pre&s;ent &s;olemn and painful occa&s;ion. I have cho&s;en them with a view to illu&s;trate the importance, and enforce the duty, of a religious education.</P>
<P>The duties of parents towards their children is one of the mo&s;t &s;acred tru&s;ts, which the Gov|ernour of the world has imparted to man. Throughout the animal creation God has implant|ed
<PB N="6" REF="025137_0005_0FCE6968797BE970">
tho&s;e in&s;tincts, which direct all cla&s;&s;es to the care of their progeny, and lead them in the mo&s;t effectual manner, to aid their progre&s;s to the ma|turity of their natures. But man, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a nobler capacity, is in this, as in all other important con|cerns, left to the voluntary and free exerci&s;e of his powers; and his children are dependent upon his affection, wi&s;dom and providence.</P>
<P>In whatever view we contemplate the education of our children, we &s;hall all be deeply impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of its importance. If we attend to the influence that moral principles and early hab|its of &s;obriety may have, in the pre&s;ent world, up|on maturer years and future practices, this con&s;id|eration alone is &s;ufficient to in&s;pire us with the highe&s;t &s;olicitude, to give the tender mind a virtu|ous direction, and to e&s;tabli&s;h tho&s;e moral princi|ples, which, under all the conditions of human life, are the be&s;t &s;ecurity for good conduct. How great are the temptations, to which youth are ex|po&s;ed! How many fall victims to the deceitful al|lurements of vice! How many de&s;troy their health by intemperance, and render their lives u&s;ele&s;s by di&s;&s;ipation! How many, who&s;e declining years are imbittered by reflections on their youth|ful folly and extravagance! &iquest; Shall we not all then feel compa&s;&s;ion and concern for tho&s;e, who are &s;oon to enter on this dangerous period, and who&s;e worldly pro&s;perity, or pre&s;ent mi&s;ery, greatly de|pends on the bias that &s;hall at fir&s;t be given to the mind, and the cour&s;es that in early life may be adopted?</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="025137_0006_0FCE69A2DD943C30">Nor &s;hall we think the bu&s;ine&s;s of education le&s;s important, if we attend to its influence on &s;ociety. Wi&s;e men in every age, have &s;ub&s;cribed to the truth of Solomon's maxim: "Righteou&s;ne&s;s ex|alteth a nation, but &s;in is the reproach of any peo|ple." The moral virtues are of the highe&s;t im|portance to the intere&s;t of civil &s;ociety. We are told that they are more e&s;pecially nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;upport of a government like ours. In the &s;ame degree, therefore, that early impre&s;&s;ions of virtue, and good moral principles, are &s;alutary to individ|uals are they important to the community. The pro&s;pects of the next generation, the &s;ucce&s;s of tho&s;e liberal mea&s;ures in government and religion, which we have adopted, and in which every good man feels him&s;elf intere&s;ted, depend in a great degree on the general practices of the youth of the pre&s;ent day. We cannot then do our coun|try more e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice, than, in our &s;everal &s;ta|tions, to u&s;e our be&s;t endeavours to form the minds of our children to moral goodne&s;s, and to train them to the love and practice of tho&s;e virtues, which will make them valuable and u&s;eful members of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Or, &s;hould we extend our views to the future and everla&s;ting happine&s;s of the objects of our pre&s;ent attention, we &s;hall &s;till, in a greater degree, be concerned for their good education. It is ea&s;ier to <HI>prevent</HI> than to <HI>cure</HI> habits of vice. If they, who convert &s;inners from the error of their ways, have the &s;atisfaction to reflect, that they have delivered the &s;ouls of their fellow beings from death, <HI>they</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="025137_0007_0FCE6969F49A4730">
cannot feel le&s;s &s;atisfaction, who, by good in&s;truc|tion and example, &s;ecure youth from vice and thereby prevent them from feeling the pre&s;ent and future evils of &s;in. Of the future practices of men we cannot, indeed, have an ab&s;olute certainty; but the good education of the child, and the virtu|ous habits of the youth, afford the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible &s;ecurity for the religious improvement of the man.</P>
<P>All the motives, that can have influence to per|&s;uade men to perform that branch of parental duty under con&s;ideration, may with their full force be pre&s;ented to our minds. With us there are no envious di&s;tinctions of orders. None are born to hereditary rights. The path to eminence and to the honourary di&s;tinctions of &s;ociety is open to every individual; and all de&s;criptions of men po&s;&s;e&s;s the means to give their children &s;uch education, as may qualify them to be u&s;eful and di&s;tingui&s;hed members of the community. Our ance&s;tors, in the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of this country, were &s;en&s;ible of the impor|tance of education, and were early attentive to the be&s;t means to &s;ecure it. Their &s;ituation in&s;pired them with liberal and &s;ublime ideas on the &s;ub|ject, and they adopted a plan, from which we en|joy the mo&s;t exten&s;ive advantages. Removed from the means of in&s;truction and improvement, which they enjoyed in their mother country, and forming a world by them&s;elves, they felt the inconveniences of their &s;ituation, and fore&s;aw that, without pecu|liar exertions, the &s;ucceeding generation would but little differ from the tribes of &s;avages with which they mu&s;t a&s;&s;ociate. They therefore e&s;tabli&s;hed a
<PB N="9" REF="025137_0008_0FCE69A434446EA0">
method of general education by legi&s;lative authori|ty. They made it the duty of every incorporation, which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the ability, to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;chools at the common expen&s;e, open as much to the children of the poor as to tho&s;e of the rich. The method has been pre&s;erved to the pre&s;ent day: And New-england, I believe, is now the only country on the globe, where the education of children is &s;o much the care of government, as to oblige the wealthy, in proportion to their property, to bear the ex|pen&s;e of &s;chools, of which all may reap an equal advantage.</P>
<P>The general utility of this plan has been fully realized. The great body of the community, at the pre&s;ent day, di&s;cover a laudable &s;pirit to carry into effect the free intentions of the legi&s;lature. The opportunities, to qualify youth for the active bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;ociety, are great; and we have only to lament the inattention and negligence of individu|als to avail them&s;elves of the means put within their reach, to prepare their children to &s;u&s;tain, with honour and emolument, the various offices of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>But among us, &iquest; Can there be tho&s;e, who are &s;o far lo&s;t to parental feelings, as not to wi&s;h to fit their children for &s;tations, that are not menial and &s;ervile? Look into &s;ociety. &iquest; Who are the men, that fill with the greate&s;t dignity and lu&s;tre the various offices of government?&mdash;&iquest; Who ri&s;e to the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed eminence in the &s;everal learned profe&s;&s;ions?&mdash;&iquest; Who manage with the greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;s the means to acquire property?&mdash;&iquest; Are
<PB N="10" REF="025137_0009_0FCE696C0663F0C8">
they generally tho&s;e, who enter into life with pe|culiar advantages of family, or with pro&s;pects of large patrimonial e&s;tates? Or, &iquest; Are they men, who were early taught to depend on the energies of their own minds, and were educated under the per&s;ua&s;ion, that their characters and &s;tations in &s;o|ciety were &s;u&s;pended on their own exertions? The an&s;wer to the&s;e que&s;tions will tend to extingui&s;h in the wealthy and eminent the pride and vanity of family, and to rai&s;e the poor and the humble from meanne&s;s and de&s;pondency. It will point parental &s;olicitude to its proper objects, and teach us all, that a good education, that habits of &s;obriety and u&s;eful application, are the be&s;t inheritance we can tran&s;mit to our children.</P>
<P>But, on this occa&s;ion, I wi&s;h to direct your at|tention more particularly to a <HI>religious</HI> education. Religion adds worth to all other accompli&s;hments. Without it the highe&s;t attainments in literature, the mo&s;t poli&s;hed forms of addre&s;s, and all the arts of bu&s;ine&s;s, lay no foundation for confidence&mdash;give no &s;ecurity for amiable and good conduct. Relig|ion alone refines the di&s;po&s;itions of men, ennobles their views, e&s;tabli&s;hes unchangeable principles of good conduct, and furni&s;hes the mo&s;t influential motives to perform all &s;ocial, all benevolent and honourable offices. Religion is as much &s;uperi|our to worldly accompli&s;hments, as the immortal &s;oul is &s;uperiour to the corruptible body&mdash;as ever|la&s;ting happine&s;s is preferable to the momentary di&s;tinctions of wealth and grandeur. It is a &s;en&s;e of the &s;uperintendence of Deity, "who&s;e eyes &s;ur|vey,
<PB N="11" REF="025137_0010_0FCE37C553130A98">
and who&s;e eylids try the children of men;" it is the belief of our accountability at the bar of God; it is a realizing view of the final i&s;&s;ue of human actions, that can re&s;train the undue influence of the pa&s;&s;ions of men, and furni&s;h us with power to re&s;i&s;t the various temptations of the world.</P>
<P>How unhappy then the condition of tho&s;e, who were led to profane the name of God, before they attained to an age to form any worthy apprehen|&s;ions of the perfection and maje&s;ty of Deity! Who were induced to make a je&s;t of the &s;olemnities of religion, before they had under&s;tanding to com|prehend its duties, or to feel the force of its obli|gations! &iquest; What &s;hall check the corrupt indul|gence of their pa&s;&s;ions?&mdash;&iquest; What &s;hall re&s;train them from the greate&s;t enormities?&mdash;&iquest; Will they not adopt the language of the practical athei&s;ts of old, "&iquest; Who is the Lord that we &s;hould fear him, and what profit &s;hall we have, if we pray unto him?"</P>
<P>Early impre&s;&s;ions are deep; they are influential. We are all &s;en&s;ible of the influence of principles, that were implanted in our minds before rea&s;on had attained its &s;trength. We are all &s;en&s;ible with what difficulty we conquer the influence of opin|ions and per&s;ua&s;ions that, through fal&s;e methods of education, were impre&s;&s;ed upon our infant minds. We may be fully convinced of their &s;uper|&s;titious origin; and yet with all the &s;trength of &s;ound rea&s;on and mature judgment, we cannot wholly eradicate their influence. &iquest; What &s;alutary effects then, may not be expected from early im|pre&s;&s;ions
<PB N="12" REF="025137_0011_0FCE697182B48CF8">
of piety, and right moral principles of action, which will receive increa&s;ing &s;trength and &s;upport from the deci&s;ions of a &s;ound judgment, the dictates of an enlightened con&s;cience, and from every habit of ju&s;t reflection? There is a pro&s;pect, that &s;ome youth, who have been favoured with a religious education, may be led a&s;tray by the ar|dour of their di&s;po&s;itions, or by the enticements of their lewd and corrupt companions. Yet they &s;in with fear and trembling. They &s;hudder at every &s;udden alarm, as though the avenging mini&s;ter of heaven was approaching to arre&s;t them in their progre&s;s of impiety, and puni&s;h their folly and &s;in. Or &s;hould they even form a <HI>habit</HI> of &s;in, unexpect|ed occurrences of divine Providence may awaken them to a keen &s;en&s;e of their guilt, call up the feel|ings of more innocent days, and render them alive to all the feelings of religion and virtue. But where the mind has never been impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of religion, where moral principles have nev|er been implanted, con&s;cience, by an early ac|quaintance with &s;in, will be &s;ilenced before its voice has been di&s;tinctly heard, and the mo&s;t aban|doned &s;tate of vice will probably be the con&s;e|quence. Look among tho&s;e, who&s;e fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions were made amid&s;t &s;cenes of vice, and who received their education under examples of &s;in, who&s;e fir&s;t e&s;&s;ays of rea&s;on and activity were amid&s;t &s;cenes of corruption and profligacy, and you will find de|grees of youthful depravity, at which you mu&s;t be a&s;toni&s;hed; and the recovery of youth, of this
<PB N="13" REF="025137_0012_0FCE69A81AB61E98">
character, from the habits of &s;in, is extremely diffi|cult and altogether improbable.</P>
<P>The parent would be ju&s;tly accounted &s;avage and inhuman, who &s;hould abandon his child in its infant &s;tate, or make no provi&s;ion for its &s;up|port and comfort in the period of childhood and youth. He would be thought unworthy the name of a father, and a di&s;grace to his &s;pecies, who &s;hould turn his &s;on into the world, at the age of manhood, without any acquaintance with the active bu&s;ine&s;s of life, and de&s;titute of all means to ob|tain an hone&s;t and reputable &s;upport. &iquest;What then mu&s;t be the character of the man, who is inatten|tive to the <HI>religious</HI> and <HI>virtuous</HI> education of his children; who takes no pains to teach them wor|thy apprehen&s;ions of the being and government of God; who neglects to impre&s;s their minds with a reverence of the divine character; and to lead them to a realizing view of the obligations and im|mortal concerns of religion? The man, who be|lives in the exi&s;tence of a God, who &s;uppo&s;es that his child po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a capacity above the brute that peri&s;hes, and yet neglects, to lead him to a right knowledge of the great truths and duties of religion, mu&s;t be dead to the true affection of a parent, lo&s;t to the mo&s;t ingenuous feelings of humanity, and altogether de&s;titute of a becoming &s;olicitude for the welfare and happine&s;s of the "fruit of his body." &iquest; Does not &s;uch neglect &s;hock all our feelings of tenderne&s;s and &s;ympathy?&mdash;&iquest; Is it not incon&s;i&s;tent with every dictate of rea&s;on, and the gro&s;&s;e&s;t vio|lation of the precepts of our religion?</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="025137_0013_0FCE6973C660A8F0">The direction of heaven to the children of I&s;rael was, "The&s;e words, which I command thee this day, &s;hall be in thine heart, and thou &s;halt teach them diligently unto thy children, and &s;halt <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of them when thou &s;itte&s;t in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> hou&s;e, and when thou walke&s;t by the way, and when thou lie&s;t down, and when thou ri&s;e&s;t up."

In general we may ob&s;erve, that the authority of the parent ought not to be exerci&s;ed with &s;uch &s;everity, as to damp the ardor of emulation, and beget a weak and &s;ervile dependence. Children &s;hould be led to place confidence in their own exertions.

Their guilt was, in a de|gree, imputed to their father, becau&s;e he did not, with the earne&s;tne&s;s and authority of a parent, check their vicious di&s;po&s;itions, and re&s;train their violent practices. In that period of human life, which needs all the con&s;olation of religion, all the &s;ooth|ing attention of <HI>filial</HI> piety, to enable a man to &s;upport its infirmities and pains, he doubtle&s;s felt all that remor&s;e, which an ingenuous mind feels upon the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of criminal neglect, in one of the mo&s;t &s;acred and important duties of man. He &s;aw his &s;ons fall from the dignity and purity of their natures. He &s;aw them the di&s;grace of the &s;a|cerdotal order, and beheld them the agents of &s;in, in the wilful and ba&s;e corruption of tho&s;e who pre&s;ented them&s;elves for the &s;incere wor&s;hip of the Deity. He felt the &s;evere and ju&s;t reprimand of his God, and was humbled by the divine declara|tion, that the prie&s;thood, in his age, the mo&s;t di&s;|tingui&s;hed honour of his country, &s;hould forever be removed from his family.</P>
<P>&iquest; And have we not now before us a &s;triking in|&s;tance of the fatal effects of the neglect of early education and good example? We behold a hu|man

man being, apparently devoid of &s;ocial affection and a &s;en&s;e of moral obligation. He has commit|ted crimes of the mo&s;t heinous nature, and is now with ignominy to lo&s;e his life, as a pe&s;t of &s;ociety; and yet he di&s;covers little or no compunction of mind, little commotion on account of the dreadful &s;cenes before him. &iquest;Has the Author of human na|ture denied him tho&s;e powers and affections, which men in common po&s;&s;e&s;s? All who are particularly acquainted with him, te&s;tify that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in|tellectual faculties to di&s;tingui&s;h right from wrong, to comprehend the nature of moral duty, and un|der&s;tand the force of moral obligation. He cer|tainly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;ome qualities that are manly and noble. Many of the cau&s;es, that more frequently are the introduction to the crime which he has committed, had no operation upon him. He never mixed in tho&s;e &s;cenes of intemperance and di&s;&s;ipa|tion, which frequently corrupt the moral powers of men, and prepare the way for &s;ins of a crim&s;on die. In his depravity, the temptations of ambition and avarice had no influence; yet in a country, where all men enjoy tho&s;e advantages for moral and religious improvement, of which we have made general mention, we behold him a &s;avage, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed of the mo&s;t malignant and revengeful pa&s;&s;ions. &iquest;To what cau&s;e &s;hall we attribute his di&s;&s;ocial, his cruel and malignant di&s;po&s;ition? For an an&s;wer to our que&s;tion we are led to the early period of his exi&s;tence.</P>

off the &s;tage of action, is an unplea&s;ant ta&s;k. Unnece&s;&s;arily to wound the feelings of the living by the relation of the crimes of their decea&s;ed re|lations, is cruel and inhuman. But, if the a&s;hes of the dead can be made to read lectures of wi&s;|dom and virtue to the living; if we can, in &s;uch a manner, place the neglects and faults of the decea&s;|ed before the eyes of the living, as to guard them again&s;t tho&s;e mi&s;takes and dangers, by which oth|ers fell, propriety may countenance the action.</P>
<P>From the be&s;t information I can obtain, I am con&s;trained to &s;ay, that the father of this unhappy man was greatly deficient in the example he &s;et before his hou&s;ehold, and in the in&s;truction he gave to his children. The di&s;po&s;ition of this man, when <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">ing and tender, was not &s;oftened by tho&s;e pa|ternal attentions, which harmonize the &s;oul, and form it to virtue. He did not receive tho&s;e in|&s;tructions and admonitions, which, as the powers Of rea&s;on expand, impre&s;s the mind with a &s;en&s;e of the Supreme Being, beget attention to the &s;erious truths of religion, and give con&s;cience a power over the pa&s;&s;ions and inferior de&s;ires. In the daily in|tercour&s;es of the family, he &s;aw not that example of love and conde&s;cen&s;ion, of tenderne&s;s and hu|manity, which enforces good in&s;truction, &s;oftens the pa&s;&s;ions of re&s;entment and revenge, and in&s;en&s;ibly forms the di&s;po&s;ition to mildne&s;s, &s;ympathy and humanity. But the example &s;et before him was impious, cruel, and barbarous. In this &s;chool the &s;on was but too ready to learn. All the rough, malignant, and revengeful pa&s;&s;ions, acquired

&s;trength, and obtained an habitual control of the mind. Amid their violent demands, the &s;till voice of con&s;cience is not heard. The mo&s;t &s;acred re|&s;traints of religion are di&s;regarded. He takes the life of man without emotions of &s;ympathy, &s;or|row, or compunction. And, in a &s;ituation that, we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, mu&s;t overwhelm the human &s;oul with di&s;tre&s;s and horror, we &s;ee him in&s;en&s;i|ble and &s;tupid. &iquest; Is it not highly probable, that his pre&s;ent in&s;en&s;ibility ari&s;es from the want of early education?</P>
<P>&iquest; Shall not his condition in&s;pire every parent pre&s;ent with the highe&s;t &s;olicitude, faithfully to perform tho&s;e important duties, which are incum|bent upon them towards their children? To this, every con&s;ideration that can enter the human mind, urges with irre&s;i&s;tible force. &iquest; Can there be &s;or|row, like the &s;orrow of the parent, who &s;ees his child in the &s;ituation of this man? But, if he be convinced by his own reflections, that this &s;itua|tion mu&s;t be imputed to his own neglect, How pungent mu&s;t be the remor&s;e of his con&s;cience! &iquest; What parent could &s;ee his &s;on fallen from virtue and u&s;efulne&s;s, numbered with infamous tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ors, and brought to an untimely and ignominious end?

From the morning of my being, I have been taught to look up to you for example and direction; and from you I learned to profane the name of my

God, and to di&s;regard all the re&s;traints of religion. In the days of my innocence, I looked up to your example, and by it I was led into the paths of in|temperance and vice. You took no care, by per|&s;ua&s;ion and parental authority, to correct the irreg|ular &s;allies of pa&s;&s;ion, and to re&s;train me in the commencement of my vicious cour&s;e. You took no pains to lead me to the knowledge of the char|acter and government of God, and to impre&s;s up|on my mind the infinite concerns of immortality. And now I have made my&s;elf vile. I have for|feited my pre&s;ent exi&s;tence to an injured commu|nity, and am about to die the death of a malefac|tor. Yet, O horror of &s;oul! I have not a heart to exerci&s;e godly &s;orrow for my &s;ins, and, with the feelings of piety, to implore the mercy of God, through the Saviour of the world.</P>
<P>Should this man carry his views forward to the final con&s;equences of impenitent tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and realize the account he him&s;elf mu&s;t render at the bar of God, I am unable to paint the remor&s;e and angui&s;h that mu&s;t fill his &s;oul.</P>
<P>The youth, here pre&s;ent, will &s;uffer the word of exhortation, to guard their minds again&s;t the temp|tations of &s;in.</P>
<P>All your ingenuous feelings, I doubt not, are engaged on this occa&s;ion. With pity and com|pa&s;&s;ion you behold the man, who is about to &s;uf|fer the pains of death. With becoming dete&s;tation and abhorrence, you contemplate the action which brought him to this untimely end. Were you thought capable of his crime, you would exclaim,
<PB N="21" REF="025137_0020_0FCE69ADD213EA18">
&iquest; Are we dogs, that we &s;hould do this thing? We believe you incapable of the crime of murder: The human mind does not pa&s;s, at once, to the more heinous deeds of &s;in. The advance is gradual. At pre&s;ent, you are in more danger from the light|er &s;hades of vice, which are le&s;s noticed, but which are often the introduction to great &s;ins. "Ab&s;tain from the appearance of evil." Cheri&s;h the ingen|uous feelings of innocence, and &s;trive to maintain a "con&s;cience void of offence." If you once al|low any &s;in, however &s;mall, to gain an habitual influence over your minds, the fear of &s;hame will be le&s;&s;ened, the force of con&s;cience dimini&s;hed, and the re&s;traints of virtue weakened; and, in time, you may be led to commit the mo&s;t atrocious &s;ins with unblu&s;hing impudence.</P>
<P>The path of honour and di&s;tinction in this world lies before you, to animate your minds to virtuous pur&s;uits; and immortal glory and felicity are prepared by the Son of God to reward your piety and goodne&s;s. Reverence then your&s;elves, and a&s;pire to the true dignity of your natures. Avoid tho&s;e &s;cenes of intemperance and licentiou&s;|ne&s;s, which inflame the pa&s;&s;ions, corrupt the be&s;t powers of the human mind, and are frequently the occa&s;ion of gro&s;s and habitual &s;ins.</P>
<P>Re&s;train the pa&s;&s;ion of anger, and never let loo&s;e the &s;pirit of revenge; le&s;t, in the &s;atisfaction of &s;uppo&s;ed injuries, you &s;hould be led into deeds of inju&s;tice, cruelty, and irreparable mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>Be ready to forgive the offences of your fellow men, as you hope that God will forgive your of|fences.

Strive to implant the principles of Chri&s;t|ianity in your brea&s;ts, and adorn your lives with benevolent and amiable virtues.

Con&s;ider that he is your father and friend, and offer him the fir&s;t fruits of your lives.

<P>You, SAMUEL FROST, are now to clo&s;e your probation. As it re&s;pects you, the la&s;t &s;ands are dropping from the gla&s;s of life, and the &s;olemnities of the invi&s;ible world will &s;oon open to your view. You have committed injuries in &s;ociety, for which you can make no reparation. You have been guilty of a crime,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On Saturday, the 23d of September, 1783, he killed his father, and was acquitted by a jury of trial on the &s;uppo&s;ition of in&s;anity.</NOTE> which a di&s;tingui&s;hed heathen nation e&s;teemed &s;o unnatural, as to render a name for it unnece&s;&s;ary.

revenge, which induced you to take away the life of man. You are to be taken away from among the living, becau&s;e you have made your&s;elf vile, and are become unworthy longer to be a member of the community. Your life and liberty are dang|erous to the peace of &s;ociety, dangerous to the lives and liberties of your fellow citizens. You are not on earth, puni&s;hed as a &s;inner again&s;t God; nor do your &s;ufferings, from the deci&s;ions of human judicatures, cancel your offences committed again&s;t Heaven. "Be not deceived; God is not mocked." At the tribunal of heaven you mu&s;t account for every action of your life. Your &s;ins, with all their aggravations, are known to God. He can never be deceived, flattered, or diverted from his ju&s;t and wi&s;e purpo&s;es. All his creatures are in his pow|er, and he di&s;po&s;es of them, as to him it &s;eemeth be&s;t. By his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t he has declared, that "<HI>murderers</HI> &s;hall not enter into the kingdom of heaven, but &s;hall have their part in the lake that burns with fire and brim&s;tone, which is the &s;econd death."</P>
<P>Upon the Chri&s;tian &s;cheme of &s;alvation, repent|ance is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to pardon. Be not then in&s;en&s;ible, &s;tupid, and hardened, while the re|alities of eternity are in immediate pro&s;pect before you. Through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, God is gracious and merciful to all penitent &s;inners. "He would not that any &s;hould peri&s;h, but that all &s;hould repent and live." He is more ready to grant his a&s;&s;i&s;tance and his mercy to all, who with contrition and &s;in|cerity a&s;k them, than the tender mother is to grant &s;upport to the infant of her brea&s;t, or the affection|ate father to give bread to his dutiful &s;on.</P>
