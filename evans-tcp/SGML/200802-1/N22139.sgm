<P>From the foregoing return the public will be enabled to form &s;ome judgment of the future advantage that the poor of this City may hope to derive from this in&s;titution, which has benevolence alone for its object. The families of many per&s;ons, who&s;e daily &s;upport depends upon their daily labor, not being able to defray the expence of phy&s;icians, attend|ance, and medicine, frequently &s;uffer great inconvenience when &s;ick, for want of medical aid; and others, when un|der like circum&s;tances, &s;ubmit to the expence, often employ per&s;ons with a &s;mall &s;hare of medical knowledge, in con&s;e|quence of which life is &s;ometimes lo&s;t, and at be&s;t involve them&s;elves and families in difficulties, from which, in &s;ome in&s;tances, they rarely recover. The many advantages which have been derived from &s;imilar in&s;titutions, both in Europe and America, in&s;pire a plea&s;ing hope in the minds of the Managers, that &s;uch of their fellow citizens, who, in this and many in&s;tances, have manife&s;ted a &s;pirit of liberality, which ju&s;tly entitles them to the warme&s;t approbation, will continue to give this in&s;titution their &s;pecial patronage.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="029201_0012_0FDFCA160FA35B60">
That the Di&s;pen&s;ary might be &s;upplied with the be&s;t medicines, and at fir&s;t hand, the Managers &s;ome time pa&s;t imported a con&s;iderable a&s;&s;ortment from Europe, which are paid for, and they have now remaining on hand medicines and furniture to the amount of about 160l.&mdash;They have al&s;o imported four complete &s;ets of aparatus, for the recovery of per&s;ons apparently drowned, which are depo&s;ited at the following places, to wit.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>One at Mr. Abraham Van Guelders, No. 77, Cortlandt-&s;treet, North river.</ITEM>
<ITEM>One at Mr. Abraham Bond's, No. 8, Little Water-&s;treet.</ITEM>
<ITEM>One at Mr. Alderman Van Tuyl's, No. 46. Water-&s;treet near Fly market.</ITEM>

<P>The pre&s;ent annual account of &s;ub&s;criptions to the Di&s;|pen&s;ary, after deducting the expences for collecting, is a|bout 400l. and this &s;tatement is made without making any allowance for &s;ub&s;cribers who may happen to die, or re|move from the city; &s;o that in all probability, the next an|nual revenue of the Di&s;pen&s;ary, as the &s;ub&s;criptions now &s;tand, will fall &s;hort of the &s;um of 400l. above mentioned; and as the yearly expences of the Di&s;pen&s;ary, including hou&s;e-rent, phy&s;ician, &s;urgeon, and apothecary's &s;alary, amount to nearly the afore&s;aid &s;um, it will be impo&s;&s;ible for the managers to extend its u&s;efulne&s;s to the degree they ar|dently wi&s;h, unle&s;s many of their fellow citizens, who have &s;ufficient ability, and who have not yet honoured the in&s;ti|tution with their names, will come forward and give it their patronage. From the above repre&s;entation, the public will &s;ee the propriety and nece&s;&s;ity of the managers &s;oliciting fre&s;h contributions, for the &s;upport of an in&s;titution, ever open and ready to afford medical relief to the indigent &s;ick.</P>
<P>Sub&s;criptions will be taken at the Di&s;pen&s;ary; al&s;o by Mr. Mo&s;es Rogers, the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Trea&s;urer, or by any of the managers.</P>
<P>The following certificates of the amount of &s;ub&s;criptions and expenditures, &s;ince the fir&s;t formation of the in&s;titution, February 1, 1791, to the 8 December, 1794, will give the
