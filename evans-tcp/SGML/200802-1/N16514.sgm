</EPIGRAPH>
<P>MY text points out to us one of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting and important events in Di|vine Providence that ever took place in this lower world, de&s;igned for the glory of God and the eternal advantage of &s;inful men; for here we are informed of the birth of the ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, who was made man for our &s;akes. A&s;&s;uming the human nature, that he might redeem and &s;ave millions of &s;ining mortals from ruin and mi&s;ery, re&s;tore them to the favour of God and make them happy with him&s;elf in glory in the heavenly world; and here you may ob&s;erve how this a&s;toni&s;hing event was di&s;covered to men, this was by the agency of an angel of heaven&mdash;for behold the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord &s;hone round about them, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of tho&s;e to whom they appeared. And well might they be afraid, when &s;urrounded with
<PB N="6" REF="021217_0006_0FB2A0D86E39D108">
&s;uch a blaze of heavenly glory as was now ex|hibited to their view; for being con&s;cious of guilt, they had rea&s;on to fear a me&s;&s;enger of wrath in&s;tead of mercy and grace. But happy for them it was quite the rever&s;e&mdash;for the angel &s;aid unto them, fear not, for behold I bring you glad tidings of great joy, which &s;hall be to all people; for unto you is born this day, in the city of David, a Saviour, who is Chri&s;t the Lord&mdash;Even this divine Saviour the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t&mdash;The long expected Me&s;&s;iah who had been &s;poken of by the holy prophets of the Lord for hundred of years before&mdash;now, now that happy time is come when that child &s;hould be born&mdash;when that Son was to be given who&s;e name is called Wonderful, Coun&s;ellor, the mighty God, the everla&s;ting Father, the Prince of Peace; for he was to procure peace between God and man, &s;o between man and man, uniting Jews and Gentiles into one church, of whom Je&s;us is the head, even the Lord our righteou&s;ne&s;s, and who is the &s;aviour of all that believe in his name, be they of any nation or kingdom whatever who dwell on the face of the earth. But where &s;hould they find this lovely babe, this darling of heaven, why wrapped in &s;wadling clothes, and laid in a manger: for &s;o it plea&s;ed God, that the &s;on of his infinite love &s;hould be di&s;tingui&s;hed to the admiration of angels and men, by his amazing conde&s;cention
<PB N="7" REF="021217_0007_0FB2A0D9D90BC610">
and humiliation. But further ob&s;erve&mdash;How &s;uddenly there was joined a choir of ble&s;&s;ed angels to celebrate the prai&s;es of God on this mo&s;t joyful occa&s;ion; and what did they pro|claim to the world, why, glory to God in the highe&s;t, on earth peace, and good will to men. How happy if we were able now with the mo&s;t elevated affections to join with the heavenly ho&s;t as well as with the &s;aints on the earth, a&s;cribing glory to our God, for this his &s;urpri&s;ing my&s;terious love in the gift of the Saviour to a guilty world&mdash;that hereby divine wi&s;dom has contrived and divine grace executed the mo&s;t important glorious plan for man's redemption: God manife&s;t in the fle&s;h, who was &s;een and a|dored by the angels, preached unto the Gen|tiles, believed on in the world and received up into glory, even this Saviour who was born in the city of David, the Saviour who is Chri&s;t the Lord.</P>
<P>MY text may well &s;erve to lead your thoughts to a &s;erious contemplation of the infinite good|ne&s;s and grace of God in the gift of Chri&s;t Je|&s;us our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, whom he has &s;ent into the world for man's redemption and &s;alvation. And here I may ob&s;erve,&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT in the gift of Chri&s;t the ble&s;&s;ed Son of God to be our Saviour, the Lord has
<PB N="8" REF="021217_0008_0FB2A0DB491F8E58">
given the greate&s;t and the mo&s;t valuable which he had to be&s;tow on us, though &s;ure it is that he had the whole world to command at his plea|&s;ure: for as for this Saviour, Chri&s;t the Lord, he was the ble&s;&s;ed Son of God&mdash;the darling of heaven, in whom God was ever well plea&s;ed; and how perfectly fitted for his mo&s;t important work as our Redeemer and Saviour was the ble&s;&s;|ed Je&s;us, in that he was the great Immanuel&mdash;God with us&mdash;God manife&s;t in the fle&s;h, by which my&s;terious union to the human nature, he was infinitely well fitted for every part of his &s;acred office, to become the Saviour of &s;in|ful men. Should the highe&s;t angel in the heavenly world have attempted our redemp|tion and &s;alvation, all would have been wholly ineffectual to this important de&s;ign; but the gift of Chri&s;t was far greater in value than would have been the whole world of angels a|bove. Amazing goodne&s;s this was indeed&mdash;this was that un&s;peakable gift, which was ad|mired by all the ble&s;&s;ed angels in the heavenly world, and thus was the gift of the Saviour, the very greate&s;t, and the deare&s;t gift God had to be&s;tow on a guilty mi&s;erable world, for which let the Lord have all the glory and prai&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. GOD not only &s;ent his Son into this world for our &s;akes, but he de&s;igned him to be a &s;a|crifice for our &s;ins&mdash;to &s;uffer, to bleed and die,
<PB N="9" REF="021217_0009_0FB2A0DCC9797DC8">
that he might &s;atisfy the divine ju&s;tice for our &s;ins again&s;t God: for that end, how wonder|fully was he fitted for that important work, for which he was appointed by his a&s;&s;uming the human nature for our &s;akes&mdash;a nature &s;uited to the ble&s;&s;ed de&s;ign of man's redemption and &s;alvation. And by that very remarkable pro|vidence was that ancient prophecy fulfiled, where it is &s;aid, that the Lord hath created a new thing in the earth, a woman &s;hall compa&s;s a man, as in the prophecy of Jeremiah; and &s;o being made man for our &s;akes, he was by his own con&s;ent made under the law, and freely &s;ubjected him&s;elf to the &s;evere penalty of it, to &s;atisfy for our &s;ins and bring in an everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s. And thus by his bearing our &s;ins in his own body on the cro&s;s, and by his &s;uffering the mo&s;t exqui&s;itely tormenting, di&s;|tre&s;&s;ing, and ignominious death that ever was endured, a full attonement was made for the &s;ins of guilty men, and hereby the way was laid open for our recovery to the favour, the image and the happy enjoyment of God in the hea|venly world, and all this grand plan of our redemption was accompli&s;hed in a method perfectly con&s;onant with the moral perfections of the Lord God, and &s;uited to his righteous government. And never, never was there &s;o lively a di&s;play of God's infinite hatred of &s;in, no not in the mo&s;t tremendous calamities that ever have been brought on this &s;inful, guilty
<PB N="10" REF="021217_0010_0FB2A0DFB71F1D50">
world, as there was in the painful, di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;ufferings of the adored Saviour for our &s;alva|tion; but &s;o it mu&s;t be when the Lord of glory became a &s;urety for the rebellious &s;ons of men, then when that awful time came, even the time of his dreadful &s;ufferings, then God &s;pared not his own &s;on, but delivered him up to become a &s;acrifice for &s;ins&mdash;witne&s;s his amazing &s;uffer|ings in the garden under the heart-felt &s;en&s;e of his father's wrath, and that awful &s;cene of &s;ufferings which the Lord of glory underwent in his pa&s;&s;age to mount Calvary, where he groaned forth his mo&s;t bitter and very affecting cries, my God, my God why ha&s;t thou for&s;aken me. O what a dreadful evil &s;in is, which really co&s;t the Saviour &s;o many di&s;tre&s;&s;ing pains and agonies to &s;atisfy for it.</P>
<P N="3">3. So was the infinite and ama&s;ing goodne&s;s of God manife&s;ted in and by the ble&s;&s;ed Medi|ator, in that this &s;acrifice of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, was for the redemption and &s;alvation of innumera|ble guilty &s;inners, who were enemies to God.</P>
<P>So we are told that Chri&s;t died for the un|godly: Now for God to pity and &s;pare, to re|deem and to &s;ave his guilty creatures, guilty of aggravated wickedne&s;s, of the mo&s;t inexcu&s;able enmity to their Maker, of the mo&s;t horrid rebel|lion again&s;t Deity it&s;elf, to appoint any way, or ordain any method for man's recovery and
<PB N="11" REF="021217_0011_0FB2A0E0A81E3F98">
happy re&s;toration to the favour and love of God, and to effect this &s;o glorious a favour, in &s;o very wonderful and expen&s;ive a manner as this was, by the mo&s;t painful &s;ufferings, and the ignominious death of the ble&s;&s;ed Son of God, in whom he was always well plea&s;ed; even by him who was perfectly holy in his nature, and in all his life, and only guilty by the imputation of the guilt of &s;inful men to him&s;elf; that this ble&s;&s;ed Son of God &s;hould &s;uffer and die for the rebellious, who had forfeited all claim to his favour and love. Sure this was a miracle of mercy indeed, when on the contrary, what might have been expected from a God of infi|nite holine&s;s and ju&s;tice; that in con&s;equence of man's rebellion again&s;t the Deity, he would have armed him&s;elf with the mo&s;t dreadful vengeance again&s;t the&s;e his enemies, and have cru&s;hed them to pieces with his rod of iron, or have eternally bani&s;hed them from all hopes of the divine mercy forever, well then at the view of this divine grace might the angels of heaven join in their doxology to God, and congratula|tions of men upon that mo&s;t &s;olemn occa&s;ion, even a multitude of the heavenly ho&s;ts:&mdash;Glory to God in the highe&s;t, on earth peace and good will towards men; for &s;ure the Lord ought to have all the glory of our redemption and &s;alva|tion, for his own infinite wi&s;dom fir&s;t laid the plan in &s;o glorious a manner, as that all the dif|ferent perfections of God perfectly harmoni&s;e,
<PB N="12" REF="021217_0012_0FB2A0E203436F18">
and are effectually &s;een and glorified, and will be &s;o to the endle&s;s ages of eternity in the hea|venly word.</P>
<P N="4">4. So was the infinite wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of God manife&s;ted in this way, of our redemp|tion through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in that by this &s;o grand an overture in the Divine Providence; the nature of man is greatly advanced in digni|ty and honour by its being united to the Savi|our. So we read that Chri&s;t took not on him the nature of Angels, but the &s;eed of Abraham. We are told by St. Luke the evangeli&s;t, that Adam our fir&s;t parent was by creation the Son of God; but then by Chri&s;t's a&s;&s;uming the human nature, and becoming the Mediator betwixt God and man; the &s;ons of Adam be|come nearly allied to the Son of God, and by the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing goodne&s;s of the Deity, our natures are united to Chri&s;t him&s;elf, who is God as well as man; therefore, every true believer in Chri&s;t Je&s;us is the child of God, not only by creation as are all the re&s;t of mankind, but they are the Children of God in a more exalted &s;en&s;e, as they are nearly united to the Saviour, who is not a&s;hamed to call them brethren; and thus our natures which are infinitely di&s;tant from, and infinitely below the Deity, are bro't near to God him&s;elf by the divine Mediator; and &s;o by that means, though in creation our natures are exalted above all others here on the
<PB N="13" REF="021217_0013_0FB2A0E5B31AE2C0">
earth; yet by the a&s;&s;umption of the human nature, in the per&s;on of the ble&s;&s;ed Mediator, this exalted far above that of the ble&s;&s;ed an|gels them&s;elves: And indeed this &s;ame Je&s;us our adored Saviour, who conde&s;cended to be|come man for our &s;akes, and in that nature &s;uffered and was crucified and &s;lain, he is rai&s;ed out of the grave, he is a&s;cended into heaven, and is &s;et on the right hand of God, far above all principalities and powers, might and domi|nion, and every name that is named: O that we had &s;o feeling a &s;en&s;e of the dignity of our natures as might be a continued re&s;traint again&s;t all kinds of iniquity, by which the hu<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"> na|ture is awfully degraded, and man become like to the bea&s;ts which peri&s;h.</P>
<P N="5">5. AND la&s;tly, &s;o was the infinite and amaz|ing goodne&s;s of God di&s;covered in this way of our redemption by Chri&s;t Je&s;us, in that hereby there is a &s;ure foundation laid for the eternal &s;alvation of Innumerable precious &s;ouls in the various ages of the world: How wonderful, how &s;urpri&s;ing have been the conque&s;ts made by the ble&s;&s;ed go&s;pel of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, attended by the influences of the holy &s;pirit of God, in the happy conver&s;ion of millions of fining mortals, who have been ju&s;tified and &s;aved through the merits of Chri&s;t's death; by which that remarkable prophecy has been happily ve|rified; that a little one has become a thou&s;and,
<PB N="14" REF="021217_0014_0FB2A0E788378400">
and a &s;mall one a &s;trong nation, as in the pro|phecy of I&s;aiah; this doubtle&s;s refers to the days of the go&s;pel, and &s;hews the va&s;t increa&s;e of the church of Chri&s;t, and if as when very great multi|tudes &s;hould be made chri&s;tians indeed, and the kingdom of the Saviour be greatly advanced on the ruins of idol wor&s;hip, when thou&s;ands &s;hould be new born in a day, and churches planted by a few apo&s;tles in a direct oppo&s;ition to all the implacable enemies to the chri&s;tian religion: How remarkably is this grand over|ture in the divine providence &s;et forth in the book of P&s;alms; thy people &s;hall be made wil|ling in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holine&s;s, from the womb of the morning thou ha&s;t the dew of thy youth, which prophecy points out in a very lively manner the large in|crea&s;e of the flock of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and e&s;pecial|ly in the fir&s;t days of the go&s;pel, when by the preaching of the word of God an innumerable multitude &s;hould become real chri&s;tians, and fill the earth; when millions and millions of true believers &s;hall be brought into the family of the adored Saviour, and repleni&s;h the chri&s;tian church &s;o as to become like the &s;tars of heaven for multitude, or as the &s;ands on the &s;ea &s;hore innumerable.</P>
<P>THUS have I con&s;idered in a few in&s;tances how the infinite goodne&s;s and grace of God has been manife&s;ted in the gift of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, to
<PB N="15" REF="021217_0015_0FB2A0EA473784D8">
be our Saviour and Redeemer.&mdash;A few infer|ences will conclude this di&s;cour&s;e,&mdash;and</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. From hence we infer, how vile a con|tempt is offered to the ble&s;&s;ed Son of God, when he is &s;lighted and rejected by &s;inful men. To &s;light or undervalue the common gifts of the divine providence is odious and offen&s;ive to the God of all mercy, but to do this amid&s;t &s;o rich a di&s;covery of divine grace, as was this of the gift of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, to &s;uffer, to bleed and die for rebellious &s;inners, how vile an in&s;tance of the blacke&s;t ingratitude mu&s;t this be in|deed.&mdash;What aggravated guilt,&mdash;guilt of the deepe&s;t dye is this, when men do as it were trample underfoot the precious blood of the ble&s;&s;ed Son of God, and put him to an open &s;hame by their &s;ins: Sure it is that the guilt of tho&s;e nations who have not been favoured with the light of the go&s;pel, is but &s;mall if compared to that of the&s;e who have been favoured with the word and ordinances of God all their days, and favoured with the charming voice of the ble&s;&s;ed Son of God, inviting them to mercy,&mdash;to grace and &s;alvation, and yet &s;light, contemn and wilfully refu&s;e it as if beneath their regards; but &s;ure it is that the&s;e who now undervalue and contemn the&s;e ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;ings will &s;ad|ly lament this their own folly, when death and judgment will awaken them to effect; then will they mo&s;t heartily lament their own &s;in and
<PB N="16" REF="021217_0016_0FB2A0EFD475CB00">
folly, when all will be to no purpo&s;e to obtain the favour of God; but know this &s;inners, that though thou&s;ands under the go&s;pel will wilfully reject the Saviour, and refu&s;e to have him to rule over them. Yet this is the will of God, that there will be numberle&s;s immortal &s;ouls &s;a|ved by virtue of his perfect merits and righteou&s;|ne&s;s:&mdash;Behold then ye unbelieving &s;ouls, who may live and die in your &s;ins, though you may reject the Saviour; yet thou&s;ands of others will joyfully receive him as their Redeemer and their God, and the Saviour will a&s;&s;uredly have a glorious retinue to become his dear friends and followers: For millions will be purcha&s;ed by his precious blood, and he &s;hall &s;ee the travel of his &s;oul, and be &s;atisfied. Sure this is the plain determination of heavenly wi&s;dom, that the many man&s;ions of heavenly glory &s;hall be filled with true believers, for the &s;aints &s;hall come from the ea&s;t and from the we&s;t, from the north and from the &s;outh, and &s;hall &s;it down with Abraham, I&s;aac and Jacob in the kingdom of God, and from an immen&s;e body of glorifi|ed &s;aints above, where they &s;hall &s;urround the throne of God, and prai&s;e and &s;erve him ever|more.</P>
<P N="2">2. INFER what a peculiar value we ought to have for the go&s;pel of the Saviour which has been the happy means of the conver&s;ion and &s;al|vation of many &s;ouls.&mdash;When we con&s;ider
<PB N="17" REF="021217_0017_0FB2A0F42F71ACF8">
how great the oppo&s;ition has been to the pure and holy go&s;pel of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and e&s;pecially on its fir&s;t entrance into this wicked world, in that the divine precepts taught hereby were directly calculated to controul and re&s;train all kinds of vice and immorality, both in the hearts and lives on &s;inful men. When this heavenly religion of the Saviour was in direct oppo&s;ition to the prevailing idolatries of the Gentile nation, and when the grand and the mo&s;t important doctrines taught by the go&s;pel were to bring men to believe in and to obey&mdash;a God incarnal&mdash;a once crucified Saviour, whom the apo&s;tles affirmed was ri&s;en from the dead, and gone into the heavenly world. And once more, when all the followers of Je&s;us might expect to be contemned, vilified and per&s;ecuted by a &s;inful world, and many expo&s;ed to the lo&s;s of their lives for their becoming chri&s;tians&mdash;To what can the &s;udden progre&s;s of this holy re|ligion be a&s;cribed? Why to no other but to the powerful, the all-powerful agency of the Lord God, and proves at once in the mo&s;t convinc|ing manner, that the chri&s;tian religion is of God&mdash;that God was really the divine author of it.&mdash;Let us all then highly value it, love it, and live daily in conformity to the&s;e &s;acred rules herein contained; whil&s;t we are pitying and praying for all the&s;e who are living under the light of the go&s;pel, and yet are making a &s;coff and mock at &s;ome of its doctrines and di|vine

precepts; who in&s;tead of embracing the Saviour and believing in him:&mdash;Alas, they re|pre&s;ent him as a mere impo&s;tor&mdash;a grand de|ceiver, and by their abandoned wicked lives they declare, that Chri&s;t &s;hall not rule over them. O may a compa&s;&s;ionate Saviour open their eyes effectually, and give to them all a true and &s;incere repentance to the acknowledg|ment of the truth, that they may be recovered out of the &s;nare of the devil who are now led captive by him at his will.</P>

ages in the future &s;tate; for the&s;e ends was laid this glorious plan for our redemption and &s;al|vation before the world began, and when the time came, that happy and ever memorable time, when infinite wi&s;dom &s;aw &s;it to &s;end the &s;on of his infinite love into this world for our &s;alvation, then appeared the Lord of life and glory, and how did he appear, why not in pomp and grandeur as was expected by the Jews; no far from this, for he was born in a &s;table, then wrapped in &s;wadling clothes and laid in a manger. Adore then the wi&s;dom, the good|ne&s;s and the grace of God in this &s;o a&s;toni&s;hing a method for our redemption and &s;alvation,&mdash;that rather than the race of men &s;hould peri&s;h, the Saviour &s;hould be made man and made a cur&s;e for their deliverance from ruin and mi&s;e|ry, and that through him they might have life eternal: Well if God has had &s;o great a value for your &s;ouls, O be very careful of their be&s;t welfare your&s;elves, and never&mdash;never expo&s;e them to ruin and mi&s;ery by any &s;en&s;ual and world|ly enjoyments, and be this fixt deeply on your minds, that all the attempts you may make to keep this mo&s;t remarkable event in divine providence in your memories, all the&s;e will no|thing avail for your eternal &s;alvation, unle&s;s you are the careful followers of Chri&s;t Je&s;us as his dear children, unle&s;s the temper of your hearts and the conduct of your lives are habi|tually conformed to the holy laws; the doctrines

and the divine precepts of your a&s;cended Savi|our.&mdash;The doctrines of your Church which you profe&s;s to believe are agreeable to the holy word of God, as to the&s;e which are e&s;&s;ential to true chri&s;tianity:&mdash;So you profe&s;s to believe that the &s;acred &s;criptures contain all the&s;e holy laws and precepts which are nece&s;&s;ary to be ob|&s;erved by all chri&s;tians, and that what&s;oever is not r<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">d in the &s;criptures, or may be proved hereby, is not to be required of any man to be believed or practiced as nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation; well then having &s;uch &s;acred doctrines to regu|late your beliefs, and &s;uch plain full and expre&s;s laws for the good regulation of your hearts and lives: Always be careful by the divine grace that your minds be deeply affected, and your lives regulated by the&s;e glorious go&s;pel truths which you often hear of and may read at your lei&s;ure; and this you may firmly believe, this you may depend on as a real important and mo&s;t intere&s;ting truth,&mdash;that the revelation of chri&s;tianity was de&s;igned by infinite wi&s;dom to be reduced to practice, and that it is heard, profe&s;&s;ed and believed will all be in vain to any immortal &s;ouls, unle&s;s this be dutifully obeyed; this then demands your immediate and your continued care and concern, obey the truth&mdash;obey the go&s;pel as ever you expect an intere&s;t in that &s;alvation which is pointed out and pro|mi&s;ed to all the true di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t Je&s;us:&mdash;and remember, ponder this often in your minds,

that a &s;upreme love to God, and a &s;incere and hearty love to your fellow men, con&s;titute the true real and e&s;ential character of all true chri&s;|tians.&mdash;Let the&s;e divine graces then be in a continued exerci&s;e in your &s;ouls, day after day, and remember and realize this as a very impor|tant truth, that unle&s;s you love God &s;upreme|ly, you dont love him as you ought to do, and this you may believe and depend on, that the &s;ure&s;t and the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial evidence of a true love to God, it is this, a dutiful hearty and a per&s;evering obedience to all his commands, and the &s;tronger your love is to the Lord God, the more uniform, &s;teady and plea&s;ant will this your obedience be, and where this &s;upreme love to God prevails in your hearts, there will &s;ure|ly follow an hearty love to your fellow men; and may I remind you of this, that this will not merely appear in a tender love and regard to tho&s;e who may be of your community, or per|&s;ua&s;ion on religious accounts, but you will love chri&s;tians of all denominations with all &s;in|cerity, and be ready to expre&s;s your love to them by all proper acts of kindne&s;s, compa&s;&s;ion and benevolence; this &s;o excellent a grace, is an imitation of God who is your divine pattern herein, and how very &s;en&s;ible and illu&s;trious are the di&s;plays of it towards you every day&mdash;every hour, and every moment of your lives. So may I call your attention to con&s;ider that divine pat|tern &s;et before you in the holy life of your dear

Redeemer, who&s;e goodne&s;s, love and grace you are &s;eriou&s;ly to commemorate this day&mdash;this divine love of the Savour brought him down from heaven for a time to take our natures up|on him&mdash;to be born of a woman to be made under the law, and to become obedient unto death, even the &s;hameful, painful, and the ac|cur&s;ed death on the cro&s;s. Walk therefore in love as Chri&s;t has loved and has given him&s;elf for us: To your honour and credit be it &s;poken that whil&s;t many &s;ocieties of our denomination are thrown into great di&s;orders and divi&s;ions by following Itinerants, who pretend to an imme|diate call and remarkable a&s;&s;i&s;tance from heaven, who are mere babes in knowledge, and novices in &s;piritual things; and yet are vain enough to be|lieve them&s;elves fit to be the teachers of others, and able to &s;peak in a public manner to tho&s;e who are willing to hear them. Your &s;ocieties appear to di&s;countenance &s;uch as the&s;e while you are willing to encourage a learned, regular and a pious mini&s;try:&mdash;Would to God that you might per&s;evere in this &s;o laudable a prac|tice to the glory of God and your own comfort and edification.</P>
<P>FINALLY be careful to bear this often upon your minds, that the &s;ame Je&s;us who became man for our &s;akes, but was di&s;pi&s;ed and rejected of men; who was vilified&mdash;reproached&mdash;con|demned

and &s;uffered on the cro&s;s, even this &s;ame Je&s;us, God, man, mediator, he &s;hall de|&s;end from heaven at the la&s;t day with a &s;hout, with the trump of God, attended by myriads of his angels, to judge the world in righteou&s;|ne&s;s; then will you, and then &s;hall we all ap|pear before his dread tribunal, when every one of us &s;hall give an account of him&s;elf to God: Then, then my friends, the grand enquiry will not be, of what denomination of chri&s;tians we have been here in life, but what has been the prevailing temper of our hearts, and the habit|ual conduct of our lives; whether we have been the true followers of Je&s;us&mdash;whether we have believed in him and &s;ubmitted to his laws as our Lord and our God.</P>
<P>WELL then, &s;eeing that all earthly enjoyments will &s;oon fail and come to a &s;peedy end, and there remains a re&s;t for all the &s;aints in the heavenly world. O let us all be in earne&s;t to prepare for that happy &s;tate. Let the Lord, let the Saviour, let his holy religion be much upon your minds; be the&s;e the &s;acred and powerful objects to in|fluence our hearts&mdash;to attract our affections, and to regulate our various actions. Then may we hope to &s;hare a part of the&s;e tran&s;cen|dent glories, and that exalted happine&s;s in the heavenly world, where is fullne&s;s of joys and plea&s;ures evermore, and where Chri&s;t will be all <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">d in all; as therefore we firmly believe that
<PB N="24" REF="021217_0024_0FB2A100F0778438">
the la&s;t tremendous day will come, when we all, with our eyes &s;hall behold the Saviour who is Chri&s;t the Lord, when we &s;hall behold him coming in the clouds with pow|er and great glory, even in that terrible day of the Lord, when the heavens &s;hall be rent a&s;under and wrapped up as a &s;croll; when the Almighty arm of the great Jehovah &s;hall darken the &s;un, and deprive the moon of its light&punc; when his divine power &s;hall da&s;h to pieces the &s;tructure of this lower world, and the elements &s;hall melt with fer|vent heat and when all the dead &s;mall and great &s;hall &s;tand before God, and the fates of all mankind &s;hall finally be determined, either to happine&s;s or mi&s;ery by an irrevo|cable deci&s;ion. O let us all be careful to prepare for this &s;o important a &s;cene, by a believing acceptance of the Saviour the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and being &s;avingly inter|e&s;ted in his perfect righteou&s;ne&s;s, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ufficient merits, we might be owned by him at the la&s;t, and being covered with the wings of his redeeming love, we might be all &s;afely conveyed to heavenly glory. There the ble&s;&s;ed &s;aints of all denominations of chri&s;tians &s;hall happily unite together, all in perfect love to God and to each other, and &s;o will they accompany the ble&s;&s;ed angels of heaven, even all the&s;e numerous inhabitants of the upper world, where &s;ur|rounding the throne of God, will they celebrate the prai&s;es of redeeming love, and give glory to the lamb, who was &s;lain, and who has redeemed us to God by his own blood out of every kindred and tongue, and people and nation, when the number of them will be ten thou&s;and times ten thou&s;and and thou&s;ands, of thou&s;ands, and when all will proclaim with a loud voice, &s;aying, ble&s;&s;ing, ho|nour, glory and power be unto him that fitteth on the throne, and unto the lamb for ever and ever: O may our &s;ouls rejoice at the views of the&s;e heavenly joys, and be more and more prepared for this &s;o glorious a &s;tate, being fitted to enter into that heavenly world, and per|mitted to behold our a&s;cended Saviour, face to face, and be tran&s;ported with the brighte&s;t di&s;coveries of his divine perfections, and with the views of the divine attributes of the Godhead.</P>
