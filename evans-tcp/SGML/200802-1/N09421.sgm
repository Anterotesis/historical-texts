<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>TO enjoy good health is better than to command the world, &s;ays a celebrated practical philo&s;o|pher<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">St. Evremond.</NOTE>, who under&s;tood the u&s;e and value of life and health better than mo&s;t men; for in exile, with a &s;mall income, and no very good con&s;titution, he cultivated an uncommon length of days into a ra|tional &s;eries of plea&s;ures; and what is much more, an uninterrupted cour&s;e of happine&s;s. But, as far as I can find, he was almo&s;t the only man that did &s;o. The generality of Men &s;eem to me not to be&s;tow a thought upon either, till it be too late to reap the be|nefit of their conviction; &s;o that health, like time, be|comes valuable only when it is lo&s;t; and we can no longer think of it but with retro&s;pect and regret.</P>
<P>That men in good health, the young and gay in their career, &s;hould be negligent of it, or abu&s;e it, re|fu&s;ing to &s;top and li&s;ten to, or take warning from o|thers, is no great wonder; but it is very &s;urprizing that mankind in general &s;hould be mi&s;taken and mi&s;led forever in the &s;ame perpetual round of fruitle&s;s attempts to repair and e&s;tabli&s;h it; not the ignorant vulgar on|ly, but the &s;en&s;ible, the judicious, men of parts and knowledge in other things, in this ca&s;e equally blind, &s;hould pur&s;ue, with the &s;ame vain hope, after repeated di&s;appointments, the thou&s;and and ten thou&s;and idle arts and tricks of medication and quackery.</P>
<P>It has been of great di&s;&s;ervice, as well as di&s;credit to the art of Phy&s;ic, and every fair practi&s;er of it, that
<PB N="iv" REF="012004_0003_0F8923AD0CF980B0">
men's expectations have been rai&s;ed by the ignorant and pre&s;uming, or the di&s;hone&s;t and artful, to hope for too much from it, more than it ever did, or can do. Re|&s;pite and relief may be had in mo&s;t chronic ca&s;es; re|medy, I fear, but in very few, if it be expected from art alone. But a &s;kilful and hone&s;t Phy&s;ician (unle&s;s he be &s;ent for too late and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed too &s;oon, which is generally the ca&s;e) will employ tho&s;e intervals of relief to introduce the powers of life and nature to act for them&s;elves, and in&s;en&s;ibly withdrawing all his medi|cines, and watching carefully over his patient's whole conduct, leave him confirmed, from conviction of their nece&s;&s;ity, in &s;uch good and &s;alutary habits as cannot fail to e&s;tabli&s;h his health for life.</P>
<P>Po&s;&s;ibly, if men were better informed of the real cau&s;es of their di&s;ea&s;es, they might be le&s;s unrea&s;ona|ble in their demands, and learn to be contented with pre&s;ent relief, &s;ubmitting with patience to that plan of life which alone can lead them to, and pre&s;erve them in, permanent health. With this view of engaging men's attention to their own happine&s;s, and undeceiv|ing them in their vain and groundle&s;s hopes of remedy, and diverting them from the delu&s;ions of art to the re|alities of nature, I have ventured to publi&s;h the fol|lowing Di&s;&s;ertation, which I mu&s;t beg the Reader to con&s;ider as, what it really is, a ha&s;ty extract of a much larger work, intended to take in the whole circle of Chronic Di&s;ea&s;es, here comprehended only in their re|pre&s;entative the Gout. If what I have &s;aid may &s;eem to want farther illu&s;tration, or more demon&s;trative proof, he will look upon it only as a &s;ketch to furni&s;h hints for his own thoughts and reflections, either to im|prove mine or reject them entirely, as may &s;eem good unto him. If he thinks, from what I have &s;aid here, or in the <HI>brochure</HI> it&s;elf, that I mean to impeach the practice of phy&s;ic in general; I &s;ay that it is not my
<PB N="v" REF="012004_0004_0F8923ADF2773080">
intention. I would decry all quacks, from AE&s;culapi|us to the pre&s;ent, either as ignorant fools, or &s;elf-con|victed impo&s;tors, adverti&s;ing daily lies, whether mount|ed on &s;tages, or riding in chariots. But the art of phy|&s;ic fairly and hone&s;tly practi&s;ed I honour as the fir&s;t of profe&s;&s;ions, comprehending the mo&s;t u&s;eful, the mo&s;t exten&s;ive and univer&s;al knowledge of nature. I think a real Phy&s;ician the mo&s;t liberal of characters upon earth; by which I do not mean every Doctor that goes about taking guineas, but him who will neither flatter the great nor deceive the ignorant, and who would pre|fer the &s;atisfaction of making one invalid a healthy man, to the wealth of <HI>Radcliff</HI> or the vogue of <HI>Ward.</HI> But there is an evil &s;pirit of quackery gone forth, that has po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all orders of men among us. I would lay it, if I could, together with every demon of &s;uper&s;tition and error, and re&s;tore the world to Truth and Nature.</P>

<HEAD>A DISSERTATION ON THE GOUT, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>HOWEVER common it may be for men that &s;uffer to complain of the evils of life, as the unavoidable lot of humanity; would they &s;top but for a moment to con|&s;ider them in the light of rea&s;on and phi|lo&s;ophy, they would find little or no foundation for them in nature; but that every man was the real au|thor of all or mo&s;t of his own mi&s;eries. Whatever doubts may be entertained of moral evils, the natural, for the mo&s;t part, &s;uch as bodily infirmity, &s;ickne&s;s and pain, all that cla&s;s of complaints which the learned call chronic di&s;ea&s;es, we mo&s;t undoubtedly bring upon our|&s;elves by our own indulgencies, exce&s;&s;es or mi&s;taken habits of life, or by &s;uffering our ill-conducted pa&s;&s;ions to lead us a&s;tray or di&s;turb our peace of mind. What|ever notions men have been taught or have received of other cau&s;es, &s;uch as accidental colds, or particularities of con&s;titution, this or that thing di&s;agreeing or &s;urfeit|ing &amp;c. the&s;e are too trifling to produce di&s;ea&s;es that commonly la&s;t for life: there mu&s;t be &s;omething more &s;ub&s;tantial, &s;omething more con&s;tant and permanent in our daily habits, to produce &s;uch inveterate evils. Tho' if you read authors or con&s;ult practitioners, what do
<PB N="2" REF="012004_0006_0F8923B190BA3230">
you find, but that you have taken cold (though you know not how), or that your complaints are gouty, rheumatic, bilious, nervous, &amp;c? words that &s;atisfy, tho' they give no kind of idea, and &s;eem to have gain|ed credit and a&s;&s;ent only by the politene&s;s of phy&s;icians, who, while they are taking their patients money, are too well bred to tell them di&s;agreeable truths, and that it is by their own faults they are ill. To enquire a lit|tle further into this matter may be well worth our trou|ble; the ta&s;k &s;eems to have been left for me, and I will perform it mo&s;t &s;incerely.</P>
<P>I have long had it in my mind to write upon chronic di&s;ea&s;es in general, in the hope of giving mankind, what mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly they have never yet had, a few ra|tional ideas about them; thinking that, if the true o|riginal cau&s;es of them were fully and fairly &s;et forth, men could not be &s;o capitally mi&s;taken to impute them, as they do, to the fal&s;e and imaginary, and therefore apply fal&s;e and imaginary remedies; nor think that the general health of mankind were to be over&s;et by every trifle, and the recovery of it lay hid in a few drops or powders of any kind. Did they better under&s;tand the nature of chronic di&s;ea&s;es in general, and whence they proceed, they could not be &s;o unrea&s;onable to think they might live as they li&s;t with impunity, expecting repeated remedy from art; or, did they know any thing of the nature of medicine, they would find that, though fits of pain have been relieved, or &s;ickne&s;s cured by it for a time, the e&s;tabli&s;hment of health is a very different thing, depending upon other powers and prin|ciples: the fir&s;t may be and often is done by medicine, the other never. That their opinion of medicine is vain and ridiculous mu&s;t appear, I think, very evident|ly to any one who recollects that the art of phy&s;ic has now been practi&s;ed, more or le&s;s regularly, above two thou&s;and years; and mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly there is not yet di&s;|covered any one certain remedy for any di&s;ea&s;e. Ought not this to make us &s;u&s;pect that there is no &s;uch thing?
<PB N="3" REF="012004_0007_0F8923B254DA12E0">
How can it be, when different degrees of the very &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e require various means and methods, and the &s;ame thing that in one degree would relieve, or per|haps cure, in another might kill? It is by plan, by regimen, and &s;ucce&s;&s;ive intention, that di&s;ea&s;es mu&s;t be cured, when they are curable; or relieved and palliated when they are not. The &s;kilful in medicine, and learn|ed in nature, know well that health is not to be e&s;tab|li&s;hed by medicine; for its effects are but momentary, and the frequent repetition of it de&s;tructive to the &s;tron|ge&s;t frames; that if it is to be re&s;tored, it mu&s;t be by gently calling forth the powers of the body to act for them&s;elves, introducing gradually a little more and more activity, cho&s;en diet, and, above all, peace of mind, changing intirely that cour&s;e of life which fir&s;t brought on the di&s;ea&s;e: medicine co-operating a little. That this is the truth, all who know any thing of na|ture or art mu&s;t know: and I may &s;afely take upon me to &s;ay, that, though I firmly believe health may be re|&s;tored in mo&s;t ca&s;es that are not ab&s;olutely mortal, I am very &s;ure that no invalid was ever made a healthy man by the mere power of medicine. If this be the ca&s;e, how mu&s;t the initiated, according as their humanity is touched, either laugh at or pity the poor fooli&s;h world, &s;urrendring at di&s;cretion to the mo&s;t ignorant of quacks, pretending to infallible remedies which are not in na|ture. But what is &s;till more ridiculous, the patients them&s;elves are often &s;o a&s;hamed to own they have been deluded, that they favour the cheat, by pretending to relief which they never felt.</P>
<P>I have collected a few materials for this work which I intend to put in order, as &s;oon as I can find time and indu&s;try enough to &s;et about it in earne&s;t; and, if I can fini&s;h it to my own &s;atisfaction, perhaps I may &s;ome time or other trouble the world with it. At pre|&s;ent I think my&s;elf particularly called upon to &s;ay &s;ome|thing of the gout, as that di&s;ea&s;e was to make a con&s;i|derable part of my plan; and, as I &s;ee now &s;o many,
<PB N="4" REF="012004_0008_0F8923B30FD0A908">
and hear of more, who are throwing away, not only their money very fooli&s;hly, but, as I verily believe, the future health of their lives al&s;o, in hopes of a medical cure for it, to &s;hew that &s;uch hopes are chymerical, and contradictory to every idea of true philo&s;ophy and com|mon &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>I &s;hall therefore take a few extracts from this general plan, &s;ufficient to &s;hew the real original cau&s;es of all chronic di&s;ea&s;es; which, though they have been multi|plied without end, and numberle&s;s cau&s;es been a&s;&s;igned them, are certainly not many, and their fir&s;t cau&s;es ve|ry few. I think they may very fairly be reduced to the&s;e three: Indolence, Intemperance, and Vexation.</P>
<P>From one or more of the&s;e three cau&s;es, I have un|dertaken to prove that all or mo&s;t chronic di&s;ea&s;es are produced; for different di&s;ea&s;es may have the &s;ame ori|ginal cau&s;e, the difference proceeding from the various degrees of &s;trength and vigor in bodies; &s;o that what would be gout in one, in another might be rheumati&s;m, &s;tone, colic, jaundice, pal&s;y, &amp;c. The gout is mani|fe&s;tly, and I think confe&s;&s;edly, a di&s;ea&s;e of the be&s;t con|&s;titution, and may therefore fairly &s;tand as a repre&s;enta|tive of all the re&s;t: as &s;uch I &s;hall con&s;ider it for the pre&s;ent, and &s;peak of the&s;e cau&s;es in their order: but it may be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay a word or two of the gout it|&s;elf before we enquire into its cau&s;e.</P>
<P>The gout is &s;o common a di&s;ea&s;e, that there is &s;carce|ly a man in the world, whether he has had it or not, but thinks he knows perfectly what it is. So does a cook-maid think &s;he knows what fire is as well as Sir I&s;aac Newton. It may therefore &s;eem needle&s;s at pre|&s;ent to trouble our&s;elves about a definition, to &s;ay what it is: but I will venture to &s;ay what I am per|&s;uaded it is not, though contrary to the general opi|nion. It is not hereditary, it is not periodical, and it is not incurable.</P>
<P>If it were hereditary, it would be nece&s;&s;arily tran&s;|mitted from father to &s;on, and no man who&s;e father
<PB N="5" REF="012004_0009_0F8923B3CF9666F8">
had it could po&s;&s;ibly be free from it: but this is not the ca&s;e, there are many in&s;tances to the contrary: it is therefore not nece&s;&s;arily &s;o; but the father's having i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> inclines or di&s;po&s;es the Son to it. This is the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> proegumena</HI> or <HI>praedi&s;ponent</HI> of the learned, which of it|&s;elf never produced any effect at all; there mu&s;t be joined the <HI>cau&s;a procatarctica,</HI> or active efficient cau&s;e, that is, our own intemperance or mi&s;taken habit of life, to produce it; and accordingly, as this operates more or le&s;s, &s;o will the gout be. Our parents un|doubtedly give us con&s;titutions &s;imilar to their own, and, if we live in the &s;ame manner they did, we &s;hall very probably be troubled with the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;es; but this by no means proves them to be hereditary: it is what we do our&s;elves that will either bring them on, or keep us free.</P>
<P>If it were hereditary, it would appear in infancy and in women, which in general it does not. I may be told of &s;ome women who have had it. I believe never very young, nor till they had contributed to it them&s;elves; for women, as well as men, may abu&s;e a good con&s;ti|tution. I have heard likewi&s;e of a boy or two out of a million that had it, or &s;omething like it; but the&s;e boys had been &s;uffered to &s;ip wine very early, and been fed and indulged every way mo&s;t unwhole&s;omely.</P>
<P>No di&s;ea&s;es are hereditary but tho&s;e of taint or infec|tion, and maleformation; the gout is none of the&s;e, and therefore is not hereditary.</P>
<P>If the gout be a di&s;ea&s;e of indige&s;tion, and therefore of our own acquiring, we mu&s;t rea&s;on very ill, or rather not rea&s;on at all, when we &s;ay it is hereditary; for &s;ure|ly no man will &s;ay that indige&s;tion is hereditary, any more than intemperance. There are whole nations of active people knowing no luxury, who for ages have been free from it, but have it now &s;ince the Europeans have brought them wine and &s;pirits.</P>
<P>If the gout be thought hereditary becau&s;e it is incu|rable by medicine, the &s;ame may be &s;aid of every other
<PB N="6" REF="012004_0010_0F8923B49F6965A8">
chronic di&s;ea&s;e, none of which ever are cured by it, I mean, &s;o as not to return again. When was there a man who, having had one fit of rheumati&s;m, &s;tone, co|lic, &amp;c. however happily relieved by art for a time, had it not again and again, or &s;omething wor&s;e in the place of it; till he became a confirmed invalid, and died long before his time; unle&s;s &s;ome very remarkable altera|tion took place in the cour&s;e of his life to confirm his health? So it is in the gout: a man gets a fit of it, and by ab&s;tinence, patience, time and nature, the crude acrimony producing it is &s;ubdued and exhau&s;ted, and he is relieved for that time; (he might be &s;o much &s;ooner, and very &s;afely too, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of art, ju|diciou&s;ly employed) he recovers however, and in a few months is taken again. Why? Not from any thing inherent in his con&s;titution, but becau&s;e he returned to his former habit of life that produced it at fir&s;t, and will forever produce it, while the &s;trength of his body la&s;ts.</P>
<P>The truth is, we breed it at fir&s;t, we renew it again and again, and bring it on our&s;elves by our own mi&s;|takes or faults, which we would fain excu&s;e by throw|ing them back upon our parents, that our complaints may be more ju&s;tly founded. And as bankrupts, un|done by idlene&s;s and extravagance, for ever plead lo&s;&s;es and misfortunes; &s;o do we inheritance to exculpate our&s;elves.</P>
<P>It is natural enough for tho&s;e who believe the gout hereditary to think it al&s;o periodical, as if &s;omething innate and inherent in our con&s;titutions produced it at certain times: but this is a great mi&s;take; for, if it were periodical, it mu&s;t be regularly &s;o. The only pe|riodical di&s;ea&s;e I know is the intermittent fever, which, till it be di&s;turbed by the bark or any other febrifuge, is as regular as a good clock. The returns of the gout are always very uncertain, according to the quantity or quality of accumulated indige&s;tion within, and the &s;trength of our bodies.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="012004_0011_0F8923B54E469E08">
I come now to &s;hew that the gout is not incurable. If by the cure of the gout be meant the admini&s;tering a pill or a powder or medicine of any kind to do it, I fear the gout is and ever will be incurable. It has been long and often attempted in vain, from the origin of phy&s;ic to this day, from the fir&s;t quack to the pre&s;ent. Indeed there is a mo&s;t glaring ab&s;urdity at fir&s;t &s;ight, that mu&s;t &s;top any man of common &s;en&s;e, who has the lea&s;t in&s;ight into nature, or knowledge of the human frame: for if the gout be the nece&s;&s;ary effect of intem|perance, as I hope to &s;hew very evidently that it is, a medicine to cure it mu&s;t be &s;omething that will enable a man to bear the daily intemperance of his future life unhurt by the gout or any other di&s;ea&s;e; that is, &s;ome|thing given now that will take away the effect of a fu|ture cau&s;e. As well might a medicine be given now to prevent a man's breaking his leg or his neck &s;even years hence. One would think the utmo&s;t that any ra|tional man could expect from medicine was, that it &s;hould have power to relieve and remove pre&s;ent di&s;or|ders, leaving the body quite free, without pretending to in&s;ure it from further injuries. Here lies the error: men think the gout to be &s;omething latent in the body now, which, once well eradicated would never return; not &s;u&s;pecting it to be no more than each days indige&s;|tion accumulated to a certain pitch; that, as long as the vigor of life la&s;ts, always brings on every fit, which once well over, the man has no more gout nor &s;eeds of gout in him than he who never had it; and, if he did not breed it again, mo&s;t certainly would never have it again. A proof of this is, that the gout has been often cured by a milk diet, which, as long as it la&s;ted, has generally kept the patient free. But this method of cure I cannot approve, becau&s;e it relaxes and enervates the man, and does not &s;ufficiently &s;upport the health and vigor of his body.</P>
<P>Though I think the gout incurable by medicine, it is &s;o far from being incurable in its nature, that I am
<PB N="8" REF="012004_0012_0F8923B6E375CA10">
firmly per&s;uaded it may be more ea&s;ily and more per|fectly cured than almo&s;t any other chronic di&s;ea&s;e; and this is another &s;trong argument that proves it not here|ditary. My rea&s;on is, that it is confe&s;&s;edly a di&s;ea&s;e of the &s;tronge&s;t and be&s;t con&s;titution relieving it&s;elf by throwing off har&s;h and bad humors from the vitals and out of the blood upon the extremities, where they do lea&s;t harm to the powers and principles of life and health; and as the&s;e humors can be nothing more than the daily accumulations of indige&s;tion, if a man can live without breeding con&s;tantly this indige&s;ted acrimo|ny, he may mo&s;t undoubtedly live free not only from the gout, but every other chronic di&s;ea&s;e al&s;o. And that he may live &s;o, not in a perpetual &s;tate of mortifi|cation and &s;elf-denial, but with great ea&s;e and comfort to him&s;elf, in the true&s;t, mo&s;t philo&s;ophic luxury, I &s;hall endeavour to prove, I hope to the &s;atisfaction of all thinking rea&s;onable men.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid that Indolence, Intemperance, and Vexa|tion, are the original cau&s;es of all or mo&s;t of our chro|nic di&s;ea&s;es: perhaps a few accidents mu&s;t be except|ed, to which the &s;tronge&s;t and healthie&s;t are mo&s;t liable, and the effects of fevers not happily ended; and which I except, to obviate all cavil and di&s;pute with the men of art. I believe, to every con&s;iderate man, who&s;e eyes have been opened &s;o as to give him the lea&s;t in|&s;ight into nature, the truth of this propo&s;ition will be &s;o &s;elf-evident, that he mu&s;t in&s;tantly perceive it; and every invalid that will be candid enough to do it, may fairly trace all his complaints up to one or other of the&s;e cau&s;es. But it may require &s;ome explanation to the generality of men, who are &s;o &s;hort-&s;ighted as never to look back or forward far beyond the ken of their no&s;e, and therefore never &s;ee either di&s;tant cau&s;es or ef|fects: and when they are &s;ick &s;eldom enquire more than for &s;ome cold or &s;urfeit of ye&s;terday, and to &s;ome &s;uch trifling cau&s;e impute di&s;ea&s;es that la&s;t for life. An ac|cidental cold or even debauch that happens but &s;eldom

<P>Men ignorant of the ways of nature in the produc|tion and &s;upport of animals, not knowing what &s;he re|quires to pre&s;erve them in health and vigour to their ut|mo&s;t period, have conceived very &s;trange and mo&s;t a&s;|&s;uredly very fal&s;e ideas of di&s;ea&s;es in general, and &s;eem to think every di&s;ea&s;e a di&s;tinct kind of being or thing, and that there are medicines oppo&s;ed to each that will certainly remove and cure it. This makes them &s;o &s;olli|citous to know the name of their complaint, which once a&s;certain'd, they think the remedy not far off. Poor men! Is not the gout &s;ufficiently di&s;tingui&s;hed? But where is the remedy? Certainly not in the precarious &s;kill of pre&s;cribing doctors, or the &s;ecret of ignorant and enterprizing quacks. They fancy too that there is great variety of con&s;titution, with di&s;ea&s;es unavoidably peculiar to each: that certain times of life mu&s;t produce many, and that it is impo&s;&s;ible to grow old without &s;ickne&s;s of &s;ome kind or other. There is certainly no foundation in nature for any of the&s;e opinions, nor is there any real e&s;&s;ential difference of con&s;titution, but of &s;trong or weak, and this is produced more by habit than nature. The &s;trong by bad habits will become weaker, and by good the weak &s;tronger. But the mo&s;t delicate frames may be as healthy as the &s;tronge&s;t, for the &s;ame rea&s;on that a &s;parrow may be as healthy as an elephant. There is no di&s;ea&s;e nece&s;&s;arily peculiar to a|ny time of life, however the changes into the different &s;tages of it may affect the valetudinary. And it is po&s;|&s;ible for men to live to great age without any di&s;ea&s;e at all, for many have lived to upwards of an hundred with uninterrupted health.</P>

<HEAD>Of INDOLENCE.</HEAD>
<P>IT &s;eems to have been the de&s;ign of Providence, that all men &s;hould labour, every one for him&s;elf: that &s;ome are rich enough to purcha&s;e the labour of o|thers is a mere accident with regard to individuals, in which the care of Providence appears to be no other|wi&s;e concerned, than having unequally di&s;tributed tho&s;e powers and abilities by which active and fiery &s;pirits ri&s;e uppermo&s;t to pre&s;erve the harmony of &s;ub|ordination, without which &s;ociety could never exi&s;t. The rich and great have &s;o far forgot this fir&s;t principle of nature, that they renounce all bodily labour as un|worthy their condition, and thus &s;acrificing health to indulgence and dignity, they do not enjoy tho&s;e advan|tages their &s;uperior &s;tations and fortunes give them; but in happine&s;s fall often below the labouring hind. I remember to have &s;een a very ingenious little book upon the origin of evil, in which labor is con&s;idered as a great evil. The agreeable author mu&s;t &s;urely mean when it is exce&s;&s;ive, and urged on to the wearing and wa&s;ting the body. In general labour is the fir&s;t princi|ple of good to mankind; I mean the laborious them|&s;elves.

in &s;uch abundance that we &s;hould no more labor or contend for them than we do for the air, and have no|thing to do but ba&s;k in ea&s;e, and riot in enjoyment? If &s;o, I can by no means agree with him; for &s;oon, ve|ry &s;oon, in &s;uch a &s;tate of things, there would not be one healthy man upon the earth, and the whole race mu&s;t quickly peri&s;h. Indeed, I am afraid, notwith&s;tanding all our unrea&s;onable and unphilo&s;ophical complainings, the utmo&s;t wit of man can not remove the lea&s;t evil out of nature, without taking with it all the good. But begging pardon for this little digre&s;&s;ion, and to come back to my own purpo&s;e, I think he had been nearer the truth, had he put Indolence in its &s;tead, which is a &s;ource of great evil. Nothing undermines the foundation of all our happine&s;s, the health and vi|gor of the body, like it, or lays &s;uch a train or di&s;ea&s;es to come. But I mu&s;t endeavour to &s;hew in what man|ner.</P>
<P>It is upon the minute&s;t and almo&s;t invi&s;ible parts of the body, our be&s;t health, &s;trength, and &s;pirits depend: the&s;e fine parts, commonly called capillaries, are little pipes or tubes, the extended continuations of the lar|ger blood-ve&s;&s;els, through which the fine&s;t parts of the blood mu&s;t con&s;tantly pa&s;s, not only to keep the&s;e very &s;mall channels always free and open, but al&s;o that the particle of the blood may in their pa&s;&s;age be attenuated, broken, and rubbed into globules perfectly &s;mooth and round, and ea&s;ily divi&s;ible into &s;till le&s;s and le&s;s, till they e&s;cape the &s;ight a&s;&s;i&s;ted even by the micro&s;cope; which gives ocular demon&s;tration of this mo&s;t amazing|ly minute circulation. I have ob&s;erved my&s;elf, and a|ny curious patient man may &s;ee with a good micro&s;cope, in the pellucid membrane of any living animal, this &s;urprizing minutene&s;s. He may &s;elect and ob&s;erve one &s;ingle ve&s;&s;el, the &s;malle&s;t of tho&s;e that convey red blood, many of which would not equal the &s;malle&s;t hair in &s;ize, through which the blood may be &s;een pa&s;&s;ing, not like a fluid, but a number of little red &s;olid balls pu&s;h|ing
<PB N="12" REF="012004_0016_0F8923BD71BEE0E8">
one another on till they come to the extremity or ramification of the ve&s;&s;el where it divides into two &s;till le&s;s. There the fir&s;t globule &s;topping a little, and re|coiling, is pu&s;h'd on again till it divides into two, and lo&s;ing its red colour, pa&s;&s;es on in the &s;maller pipes fit|ted only to receive the circulation of &s;erum, lymph, and perhaps &s;till finer fluids; which being thus pre|pared, e&s;cape into a minutene&s;s beyond all po&s;&s;ible ob&s;ervation. Now the &s;trength of the heart and arte|ries, alone, in a &s;edentary cour&s;e of life, is by no me as &s;ufficient to keep up and perpetuate this motion thro' the&s;e capillaries, but requires the a&s;&s;i&s;tance and joint force of all the mu&s;cles of the body to act by intervals, compre&s;s the veins, propel and accelerate the circula|tion of the whole ma&s;s of blood, in order to force and clear the&s;e pipes, and to triturate, cribate, and purify the fluid pa&s;&s;ing through, forming every particle of it into a perfect globule, which is the form all the atoms of matter mu&s;t take from much agitation. Without this extraordinary occa&s;ional aid, the little ve&s;&s;els would, by their natural ela&s;ticity, clo&s;e up into fibres, or be ob&s;tructed by rough angular particles &s;ticking in them, and &s;topping all pa&s;&s;age. Numberle&s;s evils of the chronic kind, e&s;pecially all nervous di&s;ea&s;es, owe their origin to this cau&s;e alone. Accordingly we &s;ee mo&s;t of tho&s;e who have liv'd for any time in a &s;tate of indolence, grow emaciated and pale by the drying up of the&s;e fine ve&s;&s;els; or if they happen to be of a lax habit, having a good appetite, and nothing to vex them, they may be loaded with fat; but they grow pale withal, many of tho&s;e fine pipes being neverthele&s;s clo&s;ed up; &s;o that they appear bloated, and their fat unwhole&s;ome, having much le&s;s blood in their veins than thinner people. Hence we may learn why th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e languid pale per&s;ons upon the lea&s;t motion become faint and breathle&s;s, the blood hurrying through the larger ve&s;&s;els yet free, and like a croud ob&s;tructing its own pa&s;&s;age cau&s;ing a dan|gerous &s;uffocation. Or if they have not been long in

this &s;tate, nor the capillaries yet quite clo&s;ed, they glow, e&s;pecially young women, with a momentary red, the fine ve&s;&s;els being for that time expanded.

<P>Now I would a&s;k any rea&s;onable per&s;on, capable of con&s;idering this operation of nature with the lea&s;t glim|mering of philo&s;ophy, or even the attention of com|mon &s;en&s;e, and mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly it concerns every man to con&s;ider it well, whether he can conceive it po&s;&s;ible to &s;ub&s;titute any medicine to be &s;wallowed, that &s;hall act upon the blood and ve&s;&s;els, like the joint force of all the mu&s;cles of the body, acting and reacting occa&s;ionally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a regular cour&s;e of moderate daily labor or exerci&s;e. Unle&s;s this can be done, I will venture to pronounce that there is no &s;uch thing as a la&s;ting cure either for the gout or any other chronic di&s;ea&s;e. Yes, Sir, &s;ays a common practitioner, cordials, volatiles, bracers, &s;trengtheners, will do this, will keep up an increa&s;ed circulation. Po&s;&s;ibly they may for a few hours, by doing mi&s;chief for many days: but their action &s;oon &s;ub&s;ides, and the &s;timulus cea&s;es; they mu&s;t therefore be repeated and repeated for life. Woe be to him that takes them, and to him that leaves them off, unle&s;s it be done with great judgment. While they act, they coagulate the juices and corrupt the whole ma&s;s of blood; and when omitted, the patient mu&s;t feel all the languors and horrors of a crapulary fever after re|peated debauch; and mu&s;t have recour&s;e to them again and again, like a dram-drinker, who cannot bear his exi&s;tence but in a &s;tate of intoxication. No, art can

ever come up to nature in this mo&s;t &s;alutary of all her operations.</P>
<P>But the&s;e ob&s;tructions from crude particles of the blood, and this inanition of the capillaries, are not all the evils produced by indolence. That &s;prightly vi|gor and alacrity of health which we feel and enjoy in an active cour&s;e of life, that ze&s;t in appetite, and refre&s;h|ment after eating, which &s;ated luxury &s;eeks in vain from art, is owing wholly to new blood made every day from fre&s;h food prepared and di&s;tributed by the joint action of all the parts of the body. No man can have the&s;e delightful &s;en&s;ations who lives two days with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">me blood, but mu&s;t be languid and &s;piritle&s;s. To introduce new juices the old mu&s;t be fir&s;t thrown off, or there will be no room, there will be too great a plethora or fulne&s;s; the fir&s;t cau&s;e of di&s;ea&s;es in many ca&s;es. In a &s;tate of inactivity the old humors pa&s;s off &s;o &s;lowly, the in&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration is &s;o incon&s;iderable, that there is no void to be filled, con&s;equently by de|grees the appetite, which is the la&s;t thing that decays, that is, the de&s;ire of &s;upply, mu&s;t daily dimini&s;h, and at la&s;t be totally lo&s;t. Here art can do wonders; it can procure evacuations; we can bleed, purge and vo|mit; but then, to do any good by the&s;e, the ca&s;e mu&s;t be recent, before the humors are vitiated by too long a &s;tay in the body, which will be the ca&s;e very &s;oon, for they are all in a peri&s;hable &s;tate, which makes their daily renewal &s;o e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to health: but then the&s;e artificial evacuations di&s;charge all alike; the new, the middle, and the old juices; that is, the chyle, the blood, the &s;erum, and lymph; and by this indi&s;crimi|nate action make &s;trange confu&s;ion in tho&s;e that remain: whereas in nature's cour&s;e there is a con&s;tant regular tran&s;mutation and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, from one &s;tate to another; that is, from chyle into blood, and blood into &s;erum, and &s;o on, till they are all in their turn, like wave im|pelling wave, having done their office in various &s;hapes, elaborated and ground to &s;uch a minute &s;ubtlety and
<PB N="15" REF="012004_0019_0F8923C00EB8EBC0">
finene&s;s, that they pa&s;s off in the vapour of in&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration. In a &s;tate of indolence they do not pa&s;s off either &s;o &s;oon or &s;o regularly as they ought, becau&s;e there is not motion, nor con&s;equently heat enough to throw off the vapor: they lodge in the body too long, grow putrid, acrimonious, and hurtful many ways, like the matter formed in an ulcer, which while it is yet &s;weet, there is no bal&s;am the &s;urgeon can apply &s;o healing, but when confined, &s;oon becomes corro&s;ive, and like a cau&s;tic eats its way all round in fi&s;tulas to find vent. This &s;hews the virulent acrimony of the&s;e confined and &s;tagnating humors: hence the breath and per&s;piration, what there is of it occa&s;ionally, of indo|lent people is never &s;weet; and hence in jails, where the&s;e noxious vapors are collected and conden&s;ed from crouded wretches langui&s;hing in indolence, very ma|lignant and pe&s;tilential fevers ari&s;e.</P>
<P>Perpetual bli&s;ters have been often thought, and &s;ome|times found, to be &s;erviceable in draining off &s;ome of the&s;e &s;uperfluous juices before they are much corrupt|ed, and making, by a faint re&s;emblance of nature's ac|tion, a little more room for new; and it is for this rea|&s;on they do any good at all, by increa&s;ing the general circulation, and forcing off a few of tho&s;e humors that had circulated too long in the body, and were becoming acrid: for the quantity they di&s;charge is &s;o trifling, that there could be no phy&s;iology, nor even common &s;en&s;e, in &s;uppo&s;ing the evacuation to be the benefit pro|cured. By a vomit or purge the di&s;charge is a hund|red fold more, but the good obtained not always &s;o great, becau&s;e by the&s;e the humors are indi&s;criminate|ly thrown off, and much more of the new than the old. Many have u&s;ed frequent bleeding to renew their blood, and I have known it an&s;wer very well to &s;ome, e&s;peci|ally old people who had been long accu&s;tomed to it, whom it pre&s;erved to great age; but then it mu&s;t be begun in time, before the whole ma&s;s of humors be vi|tiated, and continued for life. Is it not &s;trange that
<PB N="16" REF="012004_0020_0F8923C0A09DB370">
men &s;hould &s;eek and prefer the&s;e violent artificial me|thods to the &s;imple, ea&s;y, plea&s;ant and con&s;tant action of nature, and chu&s;e rather to take a vomit or a purge than walk, and wear a perpetual bli&s;ter than make the lea&s;t u&s;e of their limbs?</P>
<P>Thus indolence mu&s;t inevitably lay the foundation of general di&s;ea&s;e, and according to the con&s;titution and a few concomitant circum&s;tances will be the kind of the di&s;ea&s;e: in the very be&s;t it may be gout or rheumati&s;m; in weaker habits colic, jaundice, pal&s;y, &amp;c. with all of the hy&s;terical and hypochondriacal cla&s;s. In vain have ingenious men of reading and &s;tudy, mental labor and &s;edentary life, who are more &s;ubject to di&s;ea&s;e in general than the gay and thoughtle&s;s, endeavour'd to obviate the evil by ab&s;tinence, an excellent means of remedy in many ca&s;es, and which few practi&s;e but true philo&s;ophers, who are not the mo&s;t likely to want it. But yet even they do not find it an&s;wer, and for the rea&s;ons which I have ju&s;t given that we cannot live two days in health and &s;pirits with the &s;ame blood; there mu&s;t be a new daily &s;upply of that ethereal part of our food called up to the brain to &s;upport its own, as well as the labor of the whole body. By this I mean the mo&s;t elaborated refined part of all our juices which con&s;tantly repairs and nouri&s;hes the &s;malle&s;t ve&s;&s;els and fibres. Whenever this aether fails we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily feel languor and la&s;&s;itude both of body and mind. With this difference, that in wearine&s;s of the limbs from much action the lees and coar&s;er parts are thrown off al&s;o, and the fir&s;t meal and fir&s;t &s;leep &s;oon &s;upplies the defect. In mental labor the feculence remains to ob&s;truct all appetite; there is no room, and therefore no call for &s;upply; the whole man &s;uffers and &s;inks.</P>

<HEAD>Of INTEMPERANCE.</HEAD>
<P>I COME now to &s;peak of Intemperance, for Indo|lence, blunting all our &s;en&s;ations, naturally leads us to Intemperance: we want the whip and &s;pur of luxury to excite our jaded appetites. There is no en|during the perpetual moping languor of indolences: we fly to the &s;timulating &s;en&s;ualities of the table and the bottle, friend provokes friend to exceed and accu|mulate one evil upon another; a joyous momentary relief is obtained, to be paid for &s;everely &s;oon after: the next morning our horrors increa&s;e, and in this cour&s;e there is no remedy but repetition. Thus who|ever is indolent is intemperate al&s;o, and partly from ne|ce&s;&s;ity; and the evils nece&s;&s;arily following both the&s;e cau&s;es often make the rich and great more wretched than the poor, and the ballance of happine&s;s is held more equally between them; for however other things may be di&s;tributed, happine&s;s like water always finds its level among men. I wi&s;h this ob&s;ervation might cure the&s;e of their envy, and teach the others how to enjoy their wealth.</P>
<P>Before I return to my &s;ubject, I fear I mu&s;t make an apology for what I am going to &s;ay, and hope no one will be offended when I venture to &s;ay that nine in ten of all the chronic di&s;ea&s;es in the world, particularly the gout, owe their fir&s;t ri&s;e to intemperance. Many la good man, who piques him&s;elf upon being the mo&s;t &s;o|ber regular creature alive, and never eats but of one or two plain di&s;hes, as he calls them, nor exceeds his pint of wine at any meal; keeps good hours, and never &s;leeps above eight or nine, may be &s;urprized, if not af|fronted, to have his di&s;ea&s;es imputed to intemperance; which he con&s;iders as a great crime. And yet he is of|ten ill, &s;ick in his &s;tomach, troubled with indige&s;tion, and crippled by the gout. The ca&s;e is&punc; we judge of
<PB N="18" REF="012004_0022_0F8923C210B18388">
temperance and intemperance from our own habits, without any ju&s;t idea of either. What we are u&s;ed to do, and &s;ee others do, we think right, and never go up to nature for our knowledge. The be&s;t way to ex|plain what I mean by intemperance, may be to enquire what is nature's law of temperance, and to deviate from that mu&s;t be con&s;idered as intemperance. And here I mu&s;t beg leave to ob&s;erve, that temperance is a thing of which no Engli&s;hman has or can have the lea&s;t idea, if he judges from his own or his neighbors habits. To form &s;om<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> notion of it he mu&s;t have &s;een other coun|tries, particularly Spain, Portugal or Italy, and ob|&s;erved how men live there. What they call temperance or even tolerable living, with us would be thought downright &s;tarving. In this view temperance is local and comparative; but what I mean is natural temper|ance not depending upon place or cu&s;tom (for I do not mean fa&s;ting or ab&s;tinence, which can never be &s;aluta|ry but after repletion) and we mu&s;t not judge of it from countries where a piece of bad bread and an onion with a draught of water is thought a tolerable meal; nor from our own, where beggars live better than the nobles of &s;ome countries, and where we riot in the choice of plenty native and exotic every day.</P>
<P>To come then to my idea of it, I think there is an ab&s;olute, determined temperance, to be mea&s;ured by e|very man's natural unprovoked appetite, dige&s;tion and con&s;umption, while he continues in a good &s;tate of health, and right habit of life. As long as a man eats and drinks no more than his &s;tomach calls for and will bear without the lea&s;t pain, di&s;tention, eructation or unea&s;ine&s;s of any kind; nor than his body con&s;umes and throws off to the la&s;t grain; he may be &s;aid to live in a very prudent well-regulated &s;tate of temperance, that will probably pre&s;erve him in health and &s;pirits to great old age.</P>
<P>This is nature's law: and the rever&s;e of it, or in|deed any great deviation from it, mu&s;t be intemperance.
<PB N="19" REF="012004_0023_0F8923C325E23630">
When we eat without appetite, or urge beyond mode|rate &s;atiety, provoked by incentives of any kind: when we drink without thir&s;t for the &s;ake of the liquor; indeed I cannot allow him to be &s;trictly temperate who drinks any wine or &s;trong liquor at all, unle&s;s it be me|dicinally, or now and then for the &s;ake of &s;ociety and good humor, but by no means every day.</P>
<P>Now let us compare this &s;imple idea of temperance with the common cour&s;e of mo&s;t men's lives, and ob|&s;erve their progre&s;s from health to &s;ickne&s;s. For I fear we &s;hall find but very few who have any preten&s;ions to real temperance. In early youth we are in&s;en&s;ibly led into intemperance by the indulgence and mi&s;taken fond|ne&s;s of parents and friends wi&s;hing to make us happy by anticipation. Having thus exhau&s;ted the fir&s;t de|grees of luxury before we come to the dominion of our|&s;elves, we &s;hould find no plea&s;ure in our liberty did we not advance in new &s;en&s;ations, nor feel our&s;elves free but as we abu&s;e it. Thus we go on till &s;ome friendly pain or di&s;ea&s;e bids, or rather forces us to &s;top. But in youth all the parts of our bodies are &s;trong and flex|ible, and bear the fir&s;t loads of exce&s;s with le&s;s hurt, and throw them off &s;oon by their own natural vigor and action, or with very little a&s;&s;i&s;tance from artificial eva|cuation. As we grow older, either by nature in due time, or repeated exce&s;&s;es before our time, the body is le&s;s able to free it&s;elf and wants more aid from art. The man however goes on taking daily more than he wants or can po&s;&s;ibly get rid of, he feels him&s;elf replete and oppre&s;s'd, and his appetite failing his &s;pirits &s;ink for want of fre&s;h &s;upply. He has recour&s;e to dainties, &s;auces, pickles, provocatives of all &s;orts. The&s;e &s;oon lo&s;e their power; and though he wa&s;hes down each mouthful with a gla&s;s of wine, he can reli&s;h nothing. What is to be done? Send for a phy&s;ician.

In vain would the phy&s;ician, moved by particular friend&s;hip to the man, or that integrity he owes to all men, give him the be&s;t advice in two words, <HI>quaere &s;udando,</HI> &s;eek it by labor. He would be thought a man void of all knowledge and &s;kill in his profe&s;&s;ion, if he did not immediately, or after a few evacuations, pre&s;cribe &s;tomachics, bitter &s;picy infu&s;ions in wine or brandy, vitriolic elixirs, bark, &s;teel, &amp;c. By the u&s;e of the&s;e things the &s;tomach, rou&s;ed to a little extraordi|nary action, frees it&s;elf, by di&s;charging its crude, au|&s;tere, coagulated contents into the bowels, to be thence forwarded into the blood. The man is freed for a time, finds he can eat again, and thinks all well. But this is a &s;hort-liv'd delu&s;ion. If he is robu&s;t, the acrimony floating in the blood will be thrown out, and a fit of gout &s;ucceeds; if le&s;s &s;o, rheumati&s;m or colic, &amp;c. as I have already &s;aid. But let us &s;uppo&s;e it to be the gout, which if he bears patiently, and lives moderately, drinking no madeira or brandy to keep it out of his &s;tomach, nature will relieve him in a certain time, and the gouty acrimony concocted and exhau&s;ted by the &s;ymptomatic fever that always attends, he will recover into health; if a&s;&s;i&s;ted by judicious, mild, and &s;oft medicines, his pains might be greatly a&s;&s;uaged and mitigated, and he would recover &s;ooner. But however he recovers, it is but for a &s;hort time; for he returns to his former habits, and quickly brings on the &s;ame round of complaints again and again, all aggravated by each return, and he le&s;s able to bear them; till he becomes a confirm'd invalid and cripple for life, which, with a great deal of u&s;ele&s;s medication and a few jour|nies to Bath, he drags on, till, in &s;pite of all the doc|tors he has con&s;ulted, and the infallible quack medi|cines he has taken, lamenting that none have been lucky enough to hit his ca&s;e, he &s;inks below opium and brandy, and dies long before his time. This is the cour&s;e I have liv'd to &s;ee many take, and believe it to be the ca&s;e of more whom I have never heard of, and

which any one may ob&s;erve in the circle of his acquain|tance: all this chain of evils is brought on and accu|mulated by indolence and intemperance, or mi&s;taken choice of diet. How ea&s;ily might they have been re|medied, had the real cau&s;es been known and attended to in time.</P>
<P>I believe I mu&s;t here explain a little more fully what I mean by provoking the appetite; which I take to be the general mode of intemperance among men, for cu&s;tom has made all kinds of incentives to exce&s;s &s;o common, that tho&s;e of daily u&s;e, far from being con&s;i|dered in the cla&s;s of intemperance, are by mo&s;t people thought to be not only &s;alutary but nece&s;&s;ary; and they never &s;u&s;pect the lea&s;t evil from the common de|coraments of the table, &s;alt, pepper, mu&s;tard, vinegar; and yet, however extraordinary it may &s;eem, I will venture to pronounce that exce&s;s in any of the&s;e mu&s;t be doubly prejudicial to health; hurtful in them&s;elves by their acrimony, they provoke the appetite beyond natural &s;atiety to receive an oppre&s;&s;ive load, which the &s;tomach it&s;elf would &s;oon feel, were it not artificially &s;timulat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d to di&s;charge it into the blood by wine and &s;trong liquors immediately after. Thus one error brings on another, and when men have eaten too much, they drink too much al&s;o by a kind of nece&s;&s;ity. He will certainly be a healthier man who is very moderate in the u&s;e of the&s;e things, than he who exceeds: they may be &s;ometimes u&s;eful as medicines, but can never add to the whole&s;omene&s;s of our daily food. To give &s;ome weight to what I &s;ay, there are whole nations in the world that have never known any of them, and are healthy, &s;trong and vigorous.</P>
<P>If this be true of the common provocatives at every poor man's board, who is there that exceeds not na|ture's law? who is truly temperate? What &s;hall we &s;ay of that &s;tudied, labored, refined extravagance at the ta|bles of the rich, where the culinary arts are pu&s;h'd to that exce&s;s, that luxury is become fal&s;e to it&s;elf, and

things are valued not as they are good and agreeable to the natural and undebauch'd appetite, but high, inflam|matory, rare, out of &s;ea&s;on, and co&s;tly; where, though variety is aimed at, every thing has the &s;ame ta&s;te, and nothing its own. I am &s;orry and a&s;hamed that men profe&s;&s;ing luxury &s;hould under&s;tand it &s;o little as to think it lies in the di&s;h or the &s;auce or multitude of ei|ther; or that urging beyond natural &s;atiety can afford any real enjoyment But this they do by all the re|&s;earches of culinary and medical art, introducing all the foreign aids to luxury, every &s;timulative provoca|tive that can be found in acids, &s;alts, fiery &s;pices, and e&s;&s;ences of all kinds, to rou&s;e their nerves to a little feeling; not knowing the more they are chafed and ir|ritated the more callous they &s;till grow; and the &s;ame things mu&s;t now be more frequently repeated, increa&s;|ed in quantity, and exalted in quality, till they know not where to &s;top, and every meal they make &s;erves only to overload and oppre&s;s the &s;tomach, to foul and inflame the blood, ob&s;truct and choak all the capillary channels, bring on a hectic fever of irritation, that though it rai&s;e the &s;pirits for the evening, leaves behind it all the horrid &s;en&s;ations of inanition and cra|pula the next morning; and but that nature is &s;o kind as to &s;top them in their career with a painful fit of gout or &s;ome other illne&s;s, in which &s;he gets a little re&s;pite, they would &s;oon be at the end of their cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Men bring all the&s;e evils upon them&s;elves, either not knowing or not attending to two things; the one, that plea&s;ure is a coy coquet, and to be enjoy'd mu&s;t not always be pur&s;ued; we mu&s;t &s;ometimes &s;it &s;till, that &s;he may come and court us in her turn; the other, that plea&s;ure and happine&s;s are as di&s;tinct things as riot and enjoyment: be&s;ides, plea&s;ure is not infinite, and our &s;en&s;ations are limited: we can bear but a certain mea|&s;ure, an&s;t all urging beyond it, infallibly brings pain in it's &s;tead. Let the men of high experience bear me

te&s;timony that this is true of all the luxuries of the ta|ble, wine, mu&s;ic, women, and every &s;en&s;uality.</P>
<P>The&s;e men may tell me, perhaps, that I have made a mighty fine declamation again&s;t luxury and intempe|rance; but what is this to the purpo&s;e? they de&s;ire not to be told of their faults, nor to hear di&s;agreeable truths which they know already. Have I no art or &s;kill to reconcile health and luxury, no remedy, no rare &s;ecret to repair and re&s;tore &s;en&s;ation and vigor worn to rags? no Medea's kettle to boil anew? If not, do not de&s;cribe to us a life of moderation, tempe|rance and exerci&s;e: it is not worth having upon the&s;e terms. I am aware of the unrea&s;onable expectations of many, that their demands would ri&s;e high, &s;ome of them to the impo&s;&s;ible. At pre&s;ent I am only &s;etting forth the cau&s;es; when I come to talk of remedy I will en|deavour to convince them that the artificial helps they expect are not in nature, but that there are in nature ways and means by which many gouty, broken con&s;ti|tutions, that have been de&s;paired of, might be repaired and re&s;tored to a very de&s;irable degree of health and enjoyment. But I mu&s;t fir&s;t &s;ay a word or two to the intemperate or mi&s;taken in the middle cla&s;s of life.</P>
<P>In England all degrees of men are furni&s;h'd with the means of intemperance, and therefore it is no wonder that mo&s;t men are intemperate. If they are le&s;s &s;o in other countries, it is not that they have more virtue, but they want the means: their oppre&s;&s;ive govern|ments, the precarious &s;tate of property, and their &s;u|per&s;titious religion, keep them &s;o poor that luxury is not in their power. They have however this advan|tage from it, that they are much le&s;s afflicted with chronic di&s;ea&s;es than we are. I verily believe there are more gouts in England, than in all the re&s;t of Europe: a proof that good living is more univer&s;al. But not to the advocates for this good living do I wi&s;h to addre&s;s my&s;elf; I fear they will be as incorrigible as their &s;upe|riors in higher and more refined luxury. But there are
<PB N="24" REF="012004_0028_0F8923CB0ED253A8">
&s;ome not intemperate from choice, but example, habit, cu&s;tom, mi&s;take, not knowing their daily diet to be unwhole&s;ome and productive of their di&s;ea&s;es. To the&s;e it may be of &s;ome u&s;e to have the unwhole&s;ome pointed out, and their choice directed to better things. Men of laborious occupations, who work in the open air, can and do bear great exce&s;&s;es and much unwhole&s;ome diet, without much hurt: I never knew a &s;ick or gouty gardener that was not a remarkable &s;ot. But men of &s;edentary trades and bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;hopkeepers of all kinds, feel much &s;ooner and more heavily the ill effects of in|temperance or mi&s;taken choice in their meat and drink. Their fir&s;t care therefore ought to be not to add the di&s;ea&s;es <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">f intemperance to tho&s;e of inactivity, but pro|portion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hat they take as well in quantity as in quality to their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">on&s;umption. But let us &s;ee how well they do this. They all &s;ay they live upon plain things, and never indulge in made di&s;hes; but they will eat hearti|ly of a goo&s;e or duck, with a large quantity of &s;age, o|nion, pepper and &s;alt, a pig with &s;imilar preparation, and a hare with higher and more compounded &s;ea&s;oning. Do they ever eat veal without &s;tuffing, or even a leg of mutton without caper-&s;auce? If ever they eat a &s;teak or a chop, if it is &s;ometimes without pepper, I believe it is never without pickles, the wor&s;t of all poi|&s;ons. They are &s;urprized that &s;uch meals &s;hould ri&s;e on their &s;tomachs with flatulence, &s;our and bitter hic|cups and eructations, which if they did not keep them down with a &s;ufficient quantity of wine or &s;ometimes a dram, they would be troubled with all the time of di|ge&s;tion. If this method &s;ucceeds &s;o far as to quiet their &s;tomachs for the pre&s;ent, they go on with it, regardle&s;s or ignorant of future and di&s;tant con&s;equences. Thus are the&s;e &s;harp, har&s;h, hot and inflammatory things forced out of the &s;tomach into the blood, before it has had time to dilute and &s;ubdue, or reject them, and the &s;uperfluous load they bring along with them. And thus is laid the foundation of every di&s;ea&s;e, that appears
<PB N="25" REF="012004_0029_0F8923CD297CC210">
when the&s;e acrid and fiery particles are accumulated in the blood to a certain degree.</P>
<P>There are others who&s;e preten&s;ions to plain diet may &s;eem better founded, but who neverthele&s;s eat and are very fond of things unwhol&s;ome, and very unfit for men of &s;edentary lives, &s;uch as &s;alted and &s;moked fle&s;h and fi&s;h of all kinds, hams, tongues, heavy flour pud|dings, toa&s;ted chee&s;e, &amp;c. all which are of &s;uch hard and indi&s;&s;oluble texture, that they never di&s;&s;olve well in the &s;tomach of a plowman: the &s;ame &s;alt, &s;ea&s;oning, and &s;moke, which harden and pre&s;erve them from pu|trefaction before they are eaten, keep them from di&s;&s;o|lution afterwards, &s;o that they never are dige&s;ted at all; nor is it po&s;&s;ible any good nouri&s;hment &s;hould ever come from them: the &s;alts they contain are indeed melted in the inte&s;tinal juices, and get into the blood, producing, in the be&s;t con&s;titutions, tho&s;e tettery, itchy, or &s;caly eruptions, commonly but very erroneou&s;ly called the &s;curvy, which is quite another kind of di&s;ea&s;e. To this kind of food is owing the bad health of country people, and their children's rickety heads and limbs, and big and hard bellies.</P>
<P>Another capital mi&s;take many people fall into, who in other re&s;pects are very moderate in their diet, is, that the fle&s;h-meat they eat is always over-done; if boiled too much, the juices are lo&s;t; if over-roa&s;ted, fried, or broiled, the action of the fire, continued too long, changes the mild animal fle&s;h into &s;omething of another quality; the fat is made bitter and rancid, which fire will always do by the &s;weete&s;t oil; and the &s;corched out&s;ide of the lean dry and acrimonious; the le&s;s there|fore all fle&s;h meat undergoes the power of fire, the milder and whol&s;omer it is. I do not mean by this to recommend the cu&s;toms of Cannioals or bea&s;ts of prey, that devour animals alive: but it may be ob&s;erved, that the fir&s;t are free from our di&s;ea&s;es, and the other a|mazingly &s;trong and vigorous. We may learn this from them at lea&s;t, that our meat cannot be the whol&s;omer
<PB N="26" REF="012004_0030_0F8923CE1743EAD8">
for being, as &s;ome call it, thoroughly done; and that we &s;hould learn to like it with &s;ome of its red juices un|&s;poiled by the fire. Upon this principle the Engli&s;h cookery is to be preferred to the French, who &s;tew and roa&s;t to rags; and of Engli&s;h cookery broiling mu&s;t be the be&s;t.</P>
<P>This leads me to another ob&s;ervation, which perhaps none but phy&s;icians, or tho&s;e who have &s;tudied well the nature of man and his aliments, are able to make. It is this: that man being born to devour mo&s;t of the fruits and animals of the earth and water, there ought to be a certain proportion of animal and vegetable &s;ub|&s;tances in his food; the animal tending &s;pontaneou&s;ly to putrefaction, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he vegetable correcting that tendency from going too far: thus from the due mixture of both qualities re&s;ults that neutral property, equally di&s;tant from acid as alcali, that is e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to pro|duce good blood. This is &s;o manife&s;t, that whoever will ob&s;erve attentively may &s;ee, whenever either of the&s;e prevails in the body, there is &s;o &s;trong a de&s;ire and longing for things of the other &s;ort, as well as plea|&s;ing &s;en&s;ation in the palate and &s;tomach when they are taken, as plainly indicates the natural want. Let a man have lived long upon fle&s;h-meat wholly, he will have a more eager appetite for fruit and vegetables; and if kept too long without them, as is the ca&s;e with tho&s;e who have lived &s;ome time at &s;ea, will grow &s;ick of the real &s;curvy; but if before they are too far gone they reach the land, they will eat the fir&s;t common gra&s;s they can come at with more avidity than a hor&s;e or ox, and be perfectly cured by it. In like manner they who have lived long upon vegetables (which regimen is of|ten pre&s;cribed to invalids, e&s;pecially in the gout) will have great craving for fle&s;h meat. We ought to learn from all this to attend diligently to the calls of nature, and ballance the mixture with due proportion, not only that our vitals may have the le&s;s labor in preparing and making our juices fit for nouri&s;hment, but to prevent
<PB N="27" REF="012004_0031_0F8923CECFC69AD0">
the di&s;ea&s;es that are peculiar to the predominancy of ei|ther. And here I may ob&s;erve, that the error of mo&s;t men's diet in every cla&s;s of life is, that the acid, crude and au&s;tere almo&s;t always abound; not that they do not eat fle&s;h meat enough, but they &s;poil it in the preparation and cookery, changing its animal nature into &s;ome|thing wor&s;e than vegetable, taking off entirely all its tendency to di&s;&s;olution and putrefaction by &s;alting, &s;moking, pickling, potting, and pre&s;erving things that in their own &s;imple nature would &s;oon corrupt and di&s;|&s;olve; but by the&s;e preparations are hardened and em|balmed to keep for years like mummies. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of every kind of made di&s;hes; the &s;alts, &s;pices, hot herbs, and acids with which they are &s;ea|&s;oned and compounded, pre&s;erve and harden them to keep for ever: the &s;auces and gravies they &s;wim in have the &s;ame effect as &s;o much pickle. The things we feed upon ought all to be in a peri&s;hable &s;tate, or they will never furni&s;h the materials of good blood; and whatever is hardened or &s;ea&s;oned &s;o as to keep long be|fore it be eaten, ought not to be eaten at all, for it will never di&s;&s;olve in the &s;tomach.</P>
<P>The nature of mo&s;t chronic di&s;ea&s;es, and their fir&s;t &s;ymptom heartburn, as it is commonly called, plainly &s;hew the original cau&s;e to be acid crudity prevailing in the juices; producing coagulations, concretions and ob&s;tructions of various kinds; all which are very mani|fe&s;t in the gout, rheumati&s;m, &s;tone, and mo&s;t nervous ca&s;es: the remedies al&s;o that &s;ometimes relieve and pal|liate, confirm this; &s;uch as the volatile al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">alies, hart&s;|horn, &s;alt ammoniac, te&s;taceous powder<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, &s;ope, &amp;c. Many may be &s;urprized at this, and &s;ay it cannot be; for, though they have the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, they take little or no acids: but there are many things they take that are ace&s;cent, that is, liable to become a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">id, e&s;pecially by the heat of the &s;tomach. This they are not aware of; but they are in their nature much more prejudicial than things already &s;our; for, be&s;ides that people take

for every one, and accordingly take it every day, give it their children, and teach them to like it by debauch|ing their natural ta&s;te in the earlie&s;t infancy: thus they come to reli&s;h it by habit, and to be unea&s;y without it like &s;nuff takers without their tobacco: the want is e|qually habitual and unnatural in both ca&s;es; for the &s;tomach wants wine no more than the no&s;e does &s;nuff: the immediate &s;en&s;ation of both, after a little u&s;e, is plea|&s;ant; but the remote effect of the wine taken con&s;tant|ly infinitely more pernicious than of the &s;nuff. This hurts the no&s;e only; the other accumulating a little in|dige&s;tion every day, corrupts all the juices of the body mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially. And though it be often taken with a view to promote dige&s;tion and a&s;&s;i&s;t the operations of the &s;tomach, it manife&s;tly does harm to both. In&s;tead of dige&s;ting and di&s;&s;olving, it hardens, and prevents di&s;|&s;olution, and curdles and corrupts the milky chyle and fir&s;t juices produced from our food. It warms indeed and &s;timulates the &s;tomach to greater exertion than is natural or nece&s;&s;ary, and thereby enables it to di&s;charge its contents the &s;ooner; whence that agreeable feel of warmth and comfort from its immediate action. But by his extraordinary action it forces our food out of the &s;tomach too &s;oon, before it is &s;oftened, di&s;&s;olved, and properly prepared, and &s;ends it into the bowels crude, hard, and au&s;tere, in that ca&s;e to be carried into the blood, there to produce every kind of di&s;ea&s;e. What|ever therefore the advocates for a little wine every day may think, or argue in favour of it, they are mo&s;t un|doubtedly in a very great error, and it were certainly much better and &s;afer to drink a bottle and get a little merry once a week, drinking water only or &s;mall beer at all other times: in which interval nature might to|tally &s;ubdue it and recover intirely. Water is the only liquor nature knows of or has provided for all animals; and whatever nature gives us, we may depend upon it, is be&s;t and &s;afe&s;t for us. Accordingly we &s;ee that when we have committed any exce&s;&s;es or mi&s;takes of
<PB N="30" REF="012004_0034_0F8923C74E8DAD70">
any kind, and &s;uffer from them, it is water that re|lives. Hence the chief good of Bath, Spa, and many other medicinal waters, e&s;pecially to hard drinkers. It is the element that dilutes and carries off crudities and in|dige&s;tions, &amp;c. the mineral virtues they contain may make them tolerable to the &s;tomach in their pa&s;&s;age, but do, as I believe, little more in the body: it is the wa|ter that cures. Wine, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t be not one of our own inven|tions, was given us as a cordial in &s;ickne&s;s, wearine&s;s, &s;orrow, and old age, and a mo&s;t &s;alutary charm it would be for mo&s;t of the&s;e evils, did we not exhau&s;t its power by daily u&s;e, and in&s;tead of taking it as &s;uch, drink it up as common draught in youth and health to make us mad. I know this is a very tender topic to touch up|on, and too favourite a plea&s;ure to argue again&s;t with any rea&s;onable hope of convincing; mo&s;t men having &s;o indulged them&s;elves in this bewitching habit, that they think they cannot live without a little wine every day, and their very exi&s;tence depends upon it; their &s;tomachs require it, nature calls for it, St. Paul ad|vi&s;es it, it mu&s;t be good. Thus men catch at every &s;hadow of an argument that favours their inclinations. St. Paul advi&s;es it as a medicine &s;ometimes, but cer|tainly not every day. There is no medicine I know of, that, taken every day, will not either cea&s;e to act en|tirely, or by acting too much do harm. It will be &s;aid, that many drink wine every day without gout, &s;tone, or any di&s;ea&s;e at all in con&s;equence of it. I believe not many, or I &s;hould know &s;ome of them. If any are &s;o &s;trong as to bear it to old age unhurt, they mu&s;t be ve|ry active as well as &s;trong to &s;ubdue it. But I have nothing to &s;ay to the&s;e; my bu&s;ine&s;s is with invalids who complain, and certainly ought not to mea&s;ure con|&s;titutions with tho&s;e above their match. The &s;ame ar|guments will hold equally in favour of every other bad habit. Your no&s;e will want its &s;nuff, your palate its &s;pices; and when the fa&s;hion was for women to be &s;mall

wa&s;ted, their galled &s;ides grown callous by the long im|pre&s;&s;ion of the &s;tays wanted their &s;upport. Nature, like a true female, cries out at the fir&s;t violence, but &s;ub|mits in time, is reconciled, and grows fond of the ravi&s;h|er. But it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of philo&s;ophers to di&s;tingui&s;h carefully between the real wants of nature and the ar|tificial calls of habit; and when we find the&s;e begin to hurt us, we ought to make the utmo&s;t per&s;evering ef|forts to break the enchantment of bad cu&s;toms; and though it co&s;t us &s;ome unea&s;y &s;en&s;ations at fir&s;t, we mu&s;t bear them patiently; they will not kill; and a very little time will reconcile us to better modes of life.</P>
<P>There is another capital mi&s;take many labor under in the choice of their wine, peferring the &s;trong, hot and coar&s;e &s;orts, Madeira, Port, Mountain, &amp;c. to the milder, more elegant, and certainly le&s;s unwhol|&s;ome French and Italian wines, occounting them bet|ter for the &s;tomach, and good again&s;t wind, &amp;c. My ob&s;ervation has been, that they who u&s;e the&s;e &s;trong &s;tomach wines to cure wind are never free from it, and all the gouty di&s;orders of indige&s;tion. Indeed, it cannot well be otherwi&s;e; for there is nothing &s;o repugnant to natural dige&s;tion as the u&s;e of the&s;e &s;trong liquors, which in&s;tead of di&s;&s;olving harden every thing; and thus for ever, when the fir&s;t warmth is gone off, leave a crapulary, crude, &s;our load of ye&s;terday to ferment, fret, and irritate the &s;tomach and bowels every day.</P>
<P>Thus have I endeavoured to point out two of the true, primary, capital cau&s;es of the gout, and mo&s;t other chronic di&s;ea&s;es; and mo&s;t &s;incerely wi&s;h that what I have &s;aid may engage tho&s;e whom it mo&s;tly con|cerns, the gouty, the infirm and valetudinary of every cla&s;s, to ob&s;erve, reflect and think for them&s;elves up|on the hints I have thrown out; in which light what I have &s;aid, mu&s;t be con&s;idered, rather than as logical or demon&s;trative proof. I know the rea&s;oning and argu|ments may be much improved and carried farther, and if I had more lei&s;ure I might have attempted it: but I

am well aware of the un&s;urmountable difficulty of con|vincing men again&s;t their will by any arguments at all. I chu&s;e therefore at pre&s;ent to invite them to &s;elf-con|viction from their own ob&s;ervations and experience. I flatter my&s;elf they will find it well worth their pains, to rea&s;on a little more than they do with and for them|&s;elves; and it will be a great point gained for them, if it turns their mi&s;led opinions from all that imaginary power of re&s;toring health in any of that multitude of ri|diculous and mo&s;t truly contemptible medicines, that are daily obtruded upon the public, with endle&s;s lies to recommend them, by a &s;et of the poore&s;t, mo&s;t ig|norant and paultry rogues in the nation; and engage their attention to their true remedy, a right in&s;titution of life.

<HEAD>Of VEXATION.</HEAD>
<P>I COME now to the la&s;t general cau&s;e of chronic di&s;ea&s;es, Vexation. A very fruitful parent of ma|ny bodily evils, producing generally di&s;ea&s;es of inani|tion, much more difficult, not only to be cured, but relieved, than tho&s;e we &s;uffer either from indolence or intemperance. But as it is not &s;o common a cau&s;e of the gout as the other two, it may not be nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ider it very minutely at pre&s;ent. I &s;hall not there|fore enter deeply into the regions of metaphy&s;ical con|jecture, nor run wild after my own conceits, or theirs who have gone a&s;tray before me in gue&s;&s;ing at the in|comprehen&s;ible union of &s;oul and body, and their mu|tual powers of acting upon each other. I &s;hall content my&s;elf with ob&s;erving only, what may be of &s;ome u&s;e, that every great degree of vexation, whether in the &s;hape of anger, envy, re&s;entment, di&s;content or &s;or|row,
<PB N="33" REF="012004_0037_0F8923CA817ED3E8">
has mo&s;t de&s;tructive and deleterious effects upon the vitals of the body, whether &s;udden and violent, or &s;low and la&s;ting long.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t immediate effect of violent grief or vexati|on is to take off the action of the &s;tomach intirely. Let us &s;uppo&s;e a man, in the be&s;t health, the highe&s;t good humor and &s;pirits, as well as good &s;tomach, &s;itting down to dinner with his friends, receives &s;uddenly &s;ome very afflicting news. In&s;tantly his appetite is gone, and he can neither eat nor &s;wallow a mor&s;el. Let the &s;ame thing happen after he has made a hearty chearful meal, as &s;uddenly the action of his &s;tomach, the whole power of dige&s;tion is cut off totally, as if it were become pa|ralytic; and what he has eaten lies a mo&s;t oppre&s;&s;ive load. Perhaps as the exce&s;s of weakne&s;s is often con|vul&s;ion, it may be rejected with a violent vomit, or do greater mi&s;chief. For which rea&s;on &s;uch &s;trokes of di&s;tre&s;s are le&s;s hurtful received upon an empty than a full &s;tomach. But why is this? what connexion is there between a piece of bad news and a man's &s;tomach full or empty? whatever the cau&s;e be, the effect is certain and invariably. It is becau&s;e the animal &s;pi|rits, or the action of the nerves, whatever be the &s;ecret cau&s;e of their power, is called off to &s;upply and &s;upport the tumultuous agitation of the brain, and the &s;to|mach, with all its appendages and their &s;ecretions, is left powerle&s;s and paralytic, and mu&s;t therefore either act convul&s;ively or not at all?</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this pernicious effect of perverting the na|tural action of the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines, the whole circulation of the blood is di&s;turbed. The contraction and dilatation of the heart, that is, the alternate action by which it opens to receive the blood from the veins, and clo&s;es again to force it out through the arteries; which operation ought to be as true and certain as the vibrations of a pendulum, are broken and uneven: the heart flutters, palpitates; now is overloaded with blood and in danger of &s;uffocation, now receive none at all:
<PB N="34" REF="012004_0038_0F8923D04DAF4BC0">
con&s;equently all the &s;ecretions mu&s;t be as irregular, &s;ome of the glands receiving too abundant a &s;upply that either hurries through, or oppre&s;&s;es and overpowers them, others none at all. Hence that ha&s;ty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> of pale limpid urine in amazing quantities, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;udden bur&s;ts of unmeaning tears: &s;ometimes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> dryne&s;s and choaking thir&s;t, &s;ometimes the overflowing of the mouth with water in&s;tead of &s;aliva, and many other nervous and hy&s;terical affections, fits, &s;yncope, epilep&s;y, &amp;c. all which indicate the greate&s;t tumults and per|turbations in the inmo&s;t rece&s;&s;es of the nervous and vital frame. Many kinds of di&s;ea&s;es have &s;prung from this fountain, of &s;uch unaccountably horrid and terrify|ing appearances, that formerly they could no otherwi&s;e account for them but by the malefice of &s;orcery, and the immediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of devils.</P>
<P>In flower, more &s;ilent, but longer continued grief, the effects are &s;imilar, but not &s;o violent. Many little &s;trokes repeated will do the &s;ame thing in time that a great blow does at once. The function of the &s;tomach will be more gently di&s;turbed and perverted, its juices vitiated, and all its contents will for ever turn &s;our, bitter or rancid; &s;o that no mild milky chyle, or whole|&s;ome material of nouri&s;hment, can ever come into the blood. The patient mu&s;t langui&s;h with cachectic inanition, univer&s;al bad habit of body, or pine and wa&s;te with atrophy, the want of nouri&s;hing &s;upply; whence ari&s;e complications of various di&s;ea&s;es &s;ucceed|ing each other always from bad to wor&s;e: and unle&s;s he can &s;ubdue his anxiety, and re&s;tore peace of mind, he mu&s;t in time &s;ink under it, and die, as it is &s;aid, of a broken heart.</P>
<P>Whoever vexes long, mu&s;t certainly want nouri&s;h|ment; for, be&s;ides the di&s;turbed &s;tate of the &s;tomach, it's broken appetite and bad dige&s;tion, from whence what &s;upply there is mu&s;t come not only ill-prepared, but vitiated into the blood; there can be no &s;leep in this &s;tate of mind: the perturbed &s;pirit cannot re&s;t; and
<PB N="35" REF="012004_0039_0F8923D1E85EDAA8">
it is in &s;leep that all nouri&s;hment is performed, and the finer parts of the body, chafed and worn with the fa|tigue of the day, are repaired and re&s;tored to their natural vigor. While we are awake this cannot &s;o well be done; becau&s;e the ince&s;&s;ant action of the body or mind, being always partial and irregular, prevents that equal di&s;tribution of the blood to all parts alike, from which each fibre and filament receives that &s;hare or portion that &s;uits it be&s;t. In &s;leep, when it is quiet and natural, all the mu&s;cles of the body, that is, all its active powers that are &s;ubject to our will, are lulled to re&s;t, compo&s;ed and relaxed into a genial temporary kind of pal&s;y, that leaves not the lea&s;t ob&s;truction or hindrance of the pa&s;&s;age of the blood to every atom. Accordingly the pul&s;e is always &s;lower and more equal, the re&s;piration deeper and more regular, and the &s;ame degree of vital warmth diffu&s;ed alike through every part; &s;o that the extremeties are equally warm with the heart.</P>
<P>Vexation operating in this manner upon the organs of dige&s;tion and concoction, and di&s;turbing and ob|&s;tructing the natural progre&s;s of nutrition, mu&s;t often produce di&s;ea&s;es &s;imilar to tho&s;e of long-continued in|temperance; it's fir&s;t effect being indige&s;tion with all it's &s;ymptoms, wind, eructation, heart-burn, hiccup, &amp;c. It is no wonder therefore it &s;hould &s;ometimes bring on a fit of gout, which, as I have &s;aid, is mani|fe&s;tly a di&s;ea&s;e of crudity and indige&s;tion; and often the gout in the &s;tomach and bowels. Indeed mo&s;t cold crude colics are of this kind. Schirrous concretions will al&s;o be formed in the &s;pleen, liver, glands of the me&s;entery, and throughout the whole &s;y&s;tem of the belly Many of the&s;e indurated tumors will appear outwardly, &s;o as to be felt by the hand; the&s;e in time will degenerate into cancers and cancerous ulcerations, and many fatal evils, not the lea&s;t of which, in my opinion, is, that the patient will &s;uffer a long time be|fore he dies.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="012004_0040_0F8923D28DBB8890">
All the pa&s;&s;ions when they are inordinate may have injurious effects upon the vital frame: exce&s;&s;ive joy has &s;ometimes given a fatal blow, and &s;udden bur&s;ts of laughter done great mi&s;chiefs, e&s;pecially to delicate of weakly people, who have often been thrown into &s;pa&s;ms, cramps, convul&s;ions, hy&s;teric fits and haemorrhages by them. But as I think the word Vexation comprehends the chief of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions that hurt us mo&s;t, and mean not to make a metaphy&s;ical enquiry about them, it is needle&s;s to be particular upon each. It may &s;uffice to have &s;hewn the immediate and remote influence of vex|ation upon the human body.</P>
<P>Whatever men may think of their di&s;ea&s;es, their &s;tra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters"> &s;ymptoms and appearances, and their unac|countable cau&s;es, the&s;e are the three original great &s;ources of mo&s;t of the chronic di&s;ea&s;es of mankind; which I have endeavoured to &s;et forth and explain in &s;o familiar a manner, that I hope I have been perfectly intelligible to every one who will venture to think and judge for him&s;elf. To &s;uch rational people only I ad|dre&s;s my&s;elf; and to enable them to do this the better, I have furni&s;hed the&s;e hints and ob&s;ervations, which may be extended, improved and applied to particular ca&s;es. I want not, nor wi&s;h to obtrude my ideas upon any man, however warranted I may think my&s;elf from the ob&s;ervation and experience of my whole life: my principal aim has been only to make men &s;top a little in their career, and con&s;ider with them&s;elves whether it may not be po&s;&s;ible for them to be mi&s;taken, even in that cour&s;e of diet and tho&s;e habits of life which they never &s;u&s;pected. If they are ill, and for any time, there mu&s;t be a more &s;ub&s;tantial cau&s;e for it, than they are in general willing to allow. It is not always catch|ing cold, for we do not catch cold &s;o often as we think we do; and when a healthy robu&s;t per&s;on takes cold, which can happen but rarely, if this be the whole of the di&s;ea&s;e, it cannot la&s;t long. But the truth is, when the crudity, &s;uperfluity and acrimony of an indolent, in|temperate
<PB N="37" REF="012004_0041_0F8923D624ECBA70">
temperate life have accumulated to &s;uch a degree as to make us &s;ick, then we &s;ay we have taken cold, or com|plain of a bad con&s;titution, when we have &s;poiled per|haps a very good one; or with Sydenham, that the epidemic con&s;titution of the air has infected us, or that this or that triffle has di&s;agreed. I am fully and firmly per&s;uaded, that whoever will reflect with &s;ome degree of intelligence and &s;anity, be ju&s;t to him&s;elf, and can|did with his phy&s;ician, will in general be able to trace his complaints and di&s;ea&s;es up to one or other of the&s;e three cau&s;es. And whoever does this, mu&s;t infallibly &s;ee how vain and idle all his hopes and expectations of la&s;ting remedy and e&s;tabli&s;hed health mu&s;t be from any kind of quack medicines, or indeed the common and too general practice of phy&s;ic, when the whole is re&s;ted upon &s;omething given to &s;wallow; how inadequate the means are to the end propo&s;ed and hoped for; how ill vomiting and purging can &s;upply the place of temper|ance; bleeding, bli&s;tering and all artificial evacuation, of activity; cordials and opium, of peace of mind. Is not this to fill the body with har&s;h and unwhole&s;ome juices, and then tear it to pieces to get them out again? To make artificial holes and &s;ores in the &s;kin to renew the blood and di&s;charge &s;uperfluities, in&s;tead of employ|ing mu&s;cular motion to rub off and grind down all the acrimony of angular aculeated particles, and make them &s;mooth and round, and ea&s;ily divi&s;ible; and to employ intoxication and &s;tupefaction to take off the &s;en&s;e of pain, and leave the cau&s;e where it was, or fix it fa&s;ter? Can any rea&s;onable per&s;on hope for health or long life by any of the&s;e unnatural methods, when the&s;e only are employed? Let him look round among his neighbours and acquaintance; and tell me whether, not only all the gouty, but rheumatic, colicky, jaundiced, paralytic, drop&s;ical people he has ever &s;een, are not either always &s;o, or by fits &s;o; and whether tho&s;e returning paroxy&s;ms or fits of the&s;e di&s;orders do not always grow wor&s;e and wor&s;e, in &s;pite of all their medication and quackery,

till a complication or apoplexy comes on, that at la&s;t, though long before their time, puts an end to their mi&s;erable lives. The&s;e evils are con&s;idered as the in|heritance of human nature, unavoidable and incurable, and &s;ubmitted to in ab&s;olute de&s;pair; though there has not one rational attempt, that I know of, ever yet been made to remedy them in earne&s;t. All the methods hi|therto employed have only been to relieve, and tho&s;e often &s;o perniciou&s;ly, that the future health has been &s;acrificed to obtain pre&s;ent relief or ea&s;e. This mu&s;t for ever be the ca&s;e when in chronic ca&s;es it is obtained by art, and nature has no &s;hare; or where the phy&s;ician does all, and the patient nothing for him&s;elf.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Cure of the Gout and all other Chronic Di&s;ea&s;es, and the Repair of a broken Con&s;titution.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING &s;et forth the real cau&s;es of the gout, and all it's congenial di&s;ea&s;es, I come now to the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential part, to admini&s;ter all po&s;&s;ible comfort to tho&s;e whom great pain and long &s;uffering may have made attentive and docile, and willing to take health upon the terms it is po&s;&s;ible to have it. To the young and voluptuous, who are yet in their career, and de|clare for a &s;hort life and a merry one, I have nothing to &s;ay but this, that a &s;hort life is very &s;eldom a merry one; on the contrary, is generally made up of a few years of riotous plea&s;ure without happine&s;s, to be &s;everely paid for by as many more of pain, &s;ickne&s;s, regret and de&s;pair.</P>
<P>Having &s;hewn that the gout is not hereditary, not inherent in our con&s;titutions, but produced by the daily accumulations of indige&s;ted, un&s;ubdued acrimony and &s;uperfluity, which, when they abound to a certain
<PB N="39" REF="012004_0043_0F8923D7D2828E50">
degree, mu&s;t end either in a fit of the gout, or &s;ome other di&s;ea&s;e, according to the con&s;titution, as long as any vigor is left in the body; for nature will for ever free or endeavor to free it&s;elf, and purge the blood of its impurities by gout, by fever, by pain of one kind or other, that takes off the appetite, and for a time gives re&s;pite, and prevents the pouring in of more and more enemies to di&s;turb it's operation, and make it in|effectual. Thus young people, after a fit of gout is happily and well gone off, are as free from it, as if they had never had it; and if they would take warning and be careful not to breed it again, mo&s;t certainly would for ever remain free. How ab&s;urd therefore, how ridiculou&s;ly ignorant mu&s;t be every attempt to cure the gout <HI>in futuro</HI> by medicine, before it be yet formed, before it has any exi&s;tence! Can &s;uch a medi|cine give &s;upernatural &s;trength, and enable an old man living in indolence to dige&s;t and con&s;ume, or di&s;charge the &s;uperfluities of his daily intemperance? that is, to give him more vigorous powers than nature gave him at one-and-twenty, or when the gout came fir&s;t upon him. The Duke of Portland's powder promi&s;ed to do &s;omething like this, and mo&s;t certainly kept off the gout for two or three years. But what was it? and what did it really do? It was a &s;trong &s;picy bitter taken in &s;ub&s;tance, in a large quantity, for a long time; it's effect was to keep up a con&s;tant fever as long as it was taken; this kept the gouty matter always afloat, and prevented it's fixing any where. But there was no liv|ing long with a con&s;tant fever; accordingly many of tho&s;e who took it died very &s;oon. I my&s;elf ob&s;erved between fifty and &s;ixty of it's advocates, &s;ome my pa|tients, &s;ome my acquaintance or neighbours, who were apparently cured by it; but in le&s;s than &s;ix years time, <HI>omnes and internecionem cae&s;i,</HI> they all died to a man.</P>
<P>Many &s;imilar attempts have been made with other medicines to cure not only the gout, but mo&s;t other chronic di&s;ea&s;es, and with the &s;ame fatal effects. An|timony
<PB N="40" REF="012004_0044_0F8923D9667202B0">
and Mercury elaborated into poi&s;ons by che|mi&s;try have been admini&s;tered, particularly the &s;olu|tion of &s;ublimate has torn many a &s;tomach to rags, &s;o that it could never bear common food afterwards. The deadly night-&s;hade, and hemlock, and many &s;uch dreadful poi&s;ons, have been given as alteratives to re|&s;tore health. The intention here &s;eems to be, kill or cure, to rai&s;e a violent agitation or fever in the body, in hopes it may prove &s;trong enough to throw off the di&s;ea&s;e and medicine together. The effect has ever been, notwith&s;tanding a little apparent and deceitful relief may have been perceived from the fir&s;t efforts, that it has &s;unk under both loads, and, exhau&s;ted by repeated &s;training, much &s;ooner than by the di&s;ea&s;e alone.</P>
<P>Can any one in his &s;en&s;es &s;uppo&s;e that di&s;ea&s;es a man has been his whole life contracting, and to which he is adding every day by per&s;everance in unwhol&s;ome diet, and bad habits, are to be thus removed by a <HI>coup de main ou de baguette?</HI> or that they will not return, be they cured or conjured away ever &s;o often, whil&s;t he continues the &s;ame mode of life that brought them on at fir&s;t?</P>
<P>What then is to be done? how and in what manner are chronic di&s;ea&s;es and cachexies to be cured, and health re&s;tored and e&s;tabli&s;hed? I have already &s;hewn that the cau&s;es of the&s;e evils are Indolence, Intemper|ance, and Vexation; and if there be any truth or weight in what I have &s;aid, the remedies are obvious. Activity, Temperance and Peace of Mind. It will be &s;aid, the remedies are obvious, but impracticable. Would you bid the feeble cripple, who cannot &s;tand, take up his bed and walk? the man who has lo&s;t all appetite, ab&s;tain? and the &s;leeple&s;s wretch rack'd with pain enjoy peace of mind? No certainly; I am not &s;o ab&s;urd. The&s;e mu&s;t be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by medicine; and if they have not exhau&s;ted all its power already, a little re&s;pite, a favourable interval may be obtained, that with
<PB N="41" REF="012004_0045_0F8923DA19306510">
with other artificial aids co-operating, may be greatly improved to their advantage, and if rightly employed they may get on from &s;trength to &s;trength, till they recover into perfect health. But it is not my de&s;ign at pre&s;ent to expatiate upon that particular kind of medi|cal relief which every chronic ca&s;e may require; it would lead me into too wide a field, and too far from my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, which is to &s;hew that the gout, in mo&s;t of its &s;tages and degrees, may be cured, a pre|&s;ent paroxy&s;m or fit relieved, its return for ever &s;afely prevented, and the patient e&s;tabli&s;hed in perfect health.</P>
<P>Let us &s;uppo&s;e the ca&s;e of a man from forty to fifty years of age, who has had at lea&s;t twenty fits of gout; by which mo&s;t of his joints have been &s;o clogg'd and ob&s;tructed, as to make walking or any kind of motion very unea&s;y to him: let him have had it &s;ometimes in his &s;tomach, a little in his head, and often all over him, &s;o as to make him univer&s;ally &s;ick and low-&s;pirit|ed, e&s;pecially before a regular fit has come to relieve him. This I apprehend to be as bad a ca&s;e as we need propo&s;e, and that it will not be expected that every old cripple who&s;e joints are burnt to chalk, and his bones grown together and united by anchilo&s;is, who mu&s;t be carried from his bed to his table and back again, &s;hould be propo&s;ed as an object of medication and cure: and yet even he might perhaps receive &s;ome relief and pal|liation in pain, if he has any great degree of it, which is not very common in this ca&s;e. Let us therefore &s;uppo&s;e the fir&s;t example.</P>
<P>If the point be to a&s;&s;uage the violent raging of a pre|&s;ent paroxy&s;m; this may be &s;afely done by giving &s;ome &s;oft and &s;lowly-operating laxative, neither hot nor cold, but warm, either in &s;mall do&s;es repeated &s;o as move the patient once or twice in twenty-four hours, or by a larger do&s;e oftener in le&s;s time, according to the &s;trength and exigency. This may be followed by a few lenient ab&s;orbent correctors of acrimony or even
<PB N="42" REF="012004_0046_0F8923DAE4833AA0">
gentle anodynes: proper catalap&s;ms may al&s;o be &s;afely applied to the raging part, which often a&s;&s;uage pain &s;urprizingly; with as much mild and &s;pontaneou&s;ly-di&s;&s;olving nouri&s;hment as may keep the &s;pirits from &s;inking too low: but I would wi&s;h them to &s;ink a little, and exhort the patient to bear that lowne&s;s with pa|tience and re&s;ignation, till nature, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by &s;oft and &s;ucculent food, can have time to relieve him. This ea&s;y method of treating a fit of the gout would an&s;wer in any age; and if the patient was young and vigor|ous, and the pain violent, there could be no danger in taking away a little blood. Thus in two or three days time I have often &s;een a &s;evere fit mitigated and made tolerable; and this is a better way of treating it with regard to future con&s;equences, than bearing it with pa|tience and &s;uffering it to take its cour&s;e: for the &s;ooner the joints are relieved from di&s;ten&s;ion and pain, the le&s;s danger there is of their being calcined and utterly de|&s;troyed. But in&s;tead of this, the general practice is quite the rever&s;e. Oh! keep up your &s;pirits, they cry; keep it out of your &s;tomach at all events; where, whenever it rages in di&s;tant part, it is not at all in|clined to come. As you cannot eat, you mu&s;t drink the more freely. So they take cordials, &s;trong wines, and rich &s;poon-meats. By urging in this manner, a great fever is rai&s;ed, the pain enraged and prolonged; and a fit, that would have ended &s;pontaneou&s;ly in le&s;s than a week, protracted to a month or &s;ix weeks and when it goes off at la&s;t, leaves &s;uch ob&s;truction and weakne&s;s in the parts, as cripple the man ever after. All this I hope will be fairly and candidly under&s;tood; for there are doubtle&s;s a great variety of gouty ca&s;es, but no ca&s;e that will not admit of medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance ju|diciou&s;ly admini&s;tered.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t capital point of all, and what is mo&s;t|ly de&s;ired by all, is to prevent its return, or changing into any other di&s;ea&s;e, and to e&s;tabli&s;h health. Mo&s;t men would be very well plea&s;ed and happy could this

be done by any medical trick or no&s;trum, with full li|berty of living as they li&s;t, and indulging every appe|tite and pa&s;&s;ion without controul. Some poor &s;illy creatures, ignorant of all philo&s;ophy and the nature of cau&s;es and effects, have been led into experiments of this kind by a few artful rogues, very much to the prejudice of their future health, and danger of their lives al&s;o; expecting from medicine what it never did or can perform alone, the cure of chronic di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>I think it needle&s;s here to take any pains to &s;hew the inefficacy of all the common modes of practice, vomit|ing, purging, bleeding, bli&s;tering, i&s;&s;ues <HI>&amp;c.</HI> They have been found ineffectual not only in the gout, but all other chronic ca&s;es. All &s;en&s;ible practitioners mu&s;t know their effects to be but temporary, and that they are meant and u&s;ed only as means of pre&s;ent relief. Let us &s;ee therefore by what practicable plan or regimen the per&s;on here de&s;cribed, when a fit of the gout is happily ended, may for ever prevent it's return, and &s;o confirm his general health that it &s;hall not again be over&s;et by every &s;light cold or triffling accident.</P>
<P>I have already &s;hewn that a certain degree of activity or bodily motion is nece&s;&s;ary at intervals every day, to rai&s;e the circulation to that pitch, that will keep the fine ve&s;&s;els open and the old blood pure, and al&s;o make new from the fre&s;h juices. If the patient cannot be brought to this, he has no chance of recovering to per|fect health. If therefore he can neither walk nor ride at all, he mu&s;t by degrees be brought to do both by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of others, which may be given him in the fol|lowing manner: Let a handy active &s;ervant or two be employed to rub him all over as he lies in bed with flannels, or flannel gloves, fumigated with gums and &s;pices, which will contribute greatly to brace and &s;trengthen his nerves and fibres, and move his blood without any fatigue to him&s;elf<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This may &s;eem but a trifling pre&s;cription to tho&s;e who have never tried it &s;ufficiently, but is of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence, and its effects are amazing; e&s;pecially to all tho&s;e who are too weak to u&s;e any mu&s;cular motion them&s;elves. A little friction may have little or no effect, but long continued, and repeated often, with fumigated flannels, it will do more to recover health, and &s;up|port it afterwards, than mo&s;t other things or methods. It promotes circulation and per&s;piration, open the pores, forces the fine ve&s;&s;els, &s;trains and purifies the blood, and this without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of any internal &s;timulation. It is this that keeps hor&s;es in tolerable health with very little exerci&s;e.</NOTE>This may take up from

five to ten minutes at fir&s;t, but mu&s;t be repeated five of &s;ix times a day, &s;uppo&s;ing him totally unable to help him&s;elf. But if he can walk a hundred yards only, it will forward him greatly to walk tho&s;e hundred yards every two hours, and if he can bear a carriage, let him go out in it every day, till he begins to be tired. The fir&s;t day or two all this may di&s;turb and fatigue him a little; but if he has patience to per&s;evere to the fourth, I dare promi&s;e him &s;ome amendment and increa&s;e of &s;trength; which he mu&s;t employ, as young merchants do a little money, to get more. Thus he mu&s;t go on rubbing, walking, and riding a little more and more every day, &s;topping always upon the fir&s;t &s;en&s;ation of wearine&s;s to re&s;t a little, till he be able to walk two or three miles at a &s;tretch, or ride ten without any weari|ne&s;s at all.

While we are thus endeavouring to re&s;olve all old ob&s;tructions, to open the fine ve&s;&s;els, and &s;train and purify the blood, and by degrees to enable the man to u&s;e a certain degree of exerci&s;e or labor every day; great care mu&s;t be taken in the choice of his diet, that no new acrimony be added to the old, to thwart and fru&s;trate this &s;alutary operation. His food mu&s;t be &s;oft, mild, and &s;pontaneou&s;ly dige&s;ting, and in mode ate quantity, &s;o as to give the lea&s;t po&s;&s;ible labor to the &s;tomach and bowels; that it may neither turn &s;our, nor bitter, nor rancid, nor any way degenerate from tho&s;e qualities nece&s;&s;ary to make good blood. Such things are, at fir&s;t, new-laid eggs boiled &s;o as not to harden the white creamy part of them, tripe, calves feet, chicken, partridge, rabbits, mo&s;t &s;orts of white mild fi&s;h, &s;uch as whiting, &s;kate, cod, turbot, &amp;c. and all &s;orts of &s;hell fi&s;h, particularly oy&s;ters raw.

But becau&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I have made what enquiries I could upon this capital article from living witne&s;&s;es; for I do not always pin my faith upon books, knowing it to be no uncommon thing for authors, in&s;tead of framing their &s;y&s;tem from ob&s;ervati|on and experience, to wre&s;t and explain both to &s;upport their opinions. I have been a&s;&s;ured by a phy&s;ician who practi&s;ed above thirty years in Turkey, that from the Danube to the Euphrates he had never &s;een a gouty Turk.

<P>I have al&s;o been very credibly informed, that the Gentoos or Marratas, a people of India living in the mo&s;t temperate &s;implicity, chiefly upon rice, have no &s;uch thing as the gout, or indeed any other chronic di&s;ea&s;e among them.</P></NOTE> wine undoubtedly produces nine in ten of all the gouts in the world, wine mu&s;t be avoided, or taken very &s;par|ingly,

and but &s;eldom. How is this to be done? Can a man u&s;ed to it every day, who thinks he cannot live without it, and that his exi&s;tence depends upon it, leave it off &s;afely? If he thinks he mu&s;t die of the ex|periment, doing it all at once, he may do it by degrees, and drink but half the quantity of ye&s;terday till he has brought it to nothing. But the danger of attempting it in this manner is, that it will never be done; and, like a procra&s;tinating &s;inner, he will forever put off his penitential re&s;olution till to-morrow. If he did it all at once, I would be hanged if he died of the attempt; he would be unea&s;y for three or four days, that's all. He may change his liquor, and drink a little good porter, and by degrees come to &s;mall beer, the whol&s;ome&s;t and be&s;t of all liquors except good &s;oft water. But I do not mean that this rigorous ab&s;tinence from wine is to la&s;t for life, but only during the conflict with the di|&s;ea&s;e. As &s;oon as he has recovered health and &s;trength to u&s;e exerci&s;e enough to &s;ubdue it, he may &s;afely in|dulge once a week, or perhaps twice, with a pint of wine for the &s;ake of good humour and good company, if they cannot be enjoyed without it; for I would not be &s;uch a churl as to forbid, or even damp, one of the greate&s;t joys of human life.</P>
<P>If any man &s;hould &s;ay it is better to have a little gout than take all the&s;e pains, and &s;ubmit to this di&s;|cipline; this is not the alternative: perhaps it may be more eligible to live at large, and have but a little gout now and then, that goes off well, and leaves no trace behind; but this is very &s;eldom the ca&s;e. The mi&s;|fortune is, that a little gout mo&s;t commonly comes again and again more &s;everely, till it becomes a great gout, till it cripples the man, and &s;hortens his life at lea&s;t twenty years, embittering all the latter part of it. If any one thinks this de&s;cription of it, which is the real &s;tate of the ca&s;e nine times in ten, preferable to that gradual exertion of his own powers and &s;trictne&s;s of regimen, or rather attention to him&s;elf with very
<PB N="47" REF="012004_0051_0F8923DEB54803C0">
moderate ab&s;tinence or &s;elf-denial for a year or two, as here recommended; I have no reply to make him, but mu&s;t give him up to his own choice.</P>
<P>The &s;everity of the&s;e efforts and this ab&s;temious care need be continued no longer than the di&s;ea&s;e or the ef|fects of it remain. When by per&s;everance in the prac|tice of them, together with the medical aids here re|commended, the patient &s;hall have recovered his &s;trength and locomotive powers, he may pre&s;erve and perpetuate them, and his title to longevity, upon the following plan.</P>
<P>He mu&s;t never lo&s;e &s;ight of the three great princi|ples of health and long life, Activity, Temperance, and Peace of Mind. With the&s;e ever in view, he may eat and drink of every thing the earth produces, but his diet mu&s;t be plain, &s;imple, &s;olid and tender, or in proportion to his con&s;umption; he mu&s;t eat but of one thing or two at mo&s;t at a meal, and this will &s;oon bring him to be &s;atisfied with about half his u&s;ual quantity: for all men eat about twice as much as they ought to do, provoked by variety: he mu&s;t drink but little of any liquor, and never till he has done eating: the drier every man's diet is, the better. No wine oftener than once or twice a week at mo&s;t; and this mu&s;t be con|&s;idered as a luxurious indulgence. If he be &s;ometimes led unawares into a debauch, it mu&s;t be expiated by ab&s;tinence and double exerci&s;e the next day, and he may take a little of my magne&s;ia and rhubarb as a good antidote: or if he cannot &s;leep with his unu&s;ual load, he may drink water, and with his finger in his throat throw it up. I have known &s;ome old &s;oldiers by this trick alone, never taking their do&s;e to bed with them, live to kill their acquaintance two or three times over. One moderate meal a day is abundantly &s;ufficient; therefore it is better to omit &s;upper, becau&s;e dinner is not &s;o ea&s;ily avoided. In&s;tead of &s;upper, any good ripe fruit of the &s;ea&s;on would be very &s;alutary, preventing co&s;tivene&s;s, and keeping the bowels free and open,
<PB N="48" REF="012004_0052_0F8923DF4D5D8628">
and cooling, correcting, and carrying off the heats and crudities of his indige&s;tion.</P>
<P>His activity need be no more than to per&s;evere in the habit of rubbing all over night and morning for eight or ten minutes, and walking three or four miles every day, or riding ten, or u&s;ing any bodily labor or exerci&s;e equivalent to it. In bad weather I can &s;ee no great evil in throwing a cloak round his &s;houlders and walking even in the rain; the only difficulty is to &s;um|mon re&s;olution enough to venture out; and a little u&s;e would take off all danger of catching cold, by hardening and &s;ecuring him again&s;t the po&s;&s;ibility of it upon that and all other occa&s;ions. If he dares not ri&s;que this, &s;ome &s;uccedaneum mu&s;t be u&s;ed within doors; more e&s;pecially when bad weather continues any time. I recommend it to all men to wa&s;h their feet every day, the gouty in particular, and not lie a bed above &s;even hours in &s;ummer, and eight in winter.</P>
<P>Whoever thinks there cannot be luxury enough in this cour&s;e of life, I am per&s;uaded will not find more in any other: for good health, with all its natural appe|tites and &s;en&s;ations in perfect order, is the only true foundation of luxury. And whoever cultivates it upon the fal&s;e principles of culinary or medical art, urging to exce&s;s by &s;timulating provocatives of any kind, in|&s;tead of plea&s;ure and enjoyment will meet with pain and di&s;gu&s;t.</P>
<P>Some perhaps may be rea&s;onable enough to ob&s;erve and &s;ay, This plan of yours is very &s;imple; there is no|thing marvellous in it; no wonderful di&s;covery of any of the latent powers of medicine: but will a regimen &s;o ea&s;y to be complied with as this, cure the gout, &s;tone, drop&s;y, &amp;c? Will it repair broken con&s;titutions and re&s;tore old invalids to health? My an&s;wer is, that if I may tru&s;t the experience of my whole life, and above all the experience I have had in my own per&s;on, having not only got rid of the gout, of which I have had four &s;evere fits in my younger days, but al&s;o emerged from
<PB N="49" REF="012004_0053_0F8923E28987F4E8">
the lowe&s;t ebb of life, that a man could po&s;&s;ibly be re|duced to by cholic, jaundice, and a complication of complaints, and recovered to perfect health; which I have now uninterruptedly enjoyed above ten years: I &s;ay, if I may rely upon all this, I may with great &s;afety pronounce and promi&s;e that the plan here recommend|ed, a&s;&s;i&s;ted at fir&s;t with all the collateral aids of medicine peculiar to each ca&s;e, correcting many an untoward concomitant &s;ymptom, pur&s;ued with re&s;olution and pa|tience, will certainly procure to others the &s;ame benefits I received from it, and cure every curable di&s;ea&s;e. If this be thought too much to promi&s;e, I beg it may be con&s;idered, that a life of bad habits produces all the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es: nothing therefore &s;o likely as good ones long con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ined to re&s;tore or pre&s;erve health.</P>

<P>We are all &s;o much the creatures of habit, which forms and fa&s;hions us to good or ill almo&s;t as much as nature it&s;elf, that we ought to be very attentive and
<PB N="50" REF="012004_0054_0F8923E3675FE908">
careful that our daily habits may ever tend to the con|firmation not the de&s;truction of health. It is not what we do now and then that can injure us greatly, but what we do every day mu&s;t either do us great good or harm; either e&s;tabli&s;hing our health, or fixing our di&s;|ea&s;es, for life.</P>
<P>If, after all, any man &s;hould &s;ay, the&s;e re&s;traints, this care in chu&s;ing what is whol&s;ome, this con&s;tant watch|ing over all we do, would make life &s;o grievous, that health were not worth having upon the&s;e terms; I wi&s;h him to &s;top a little, and con&s;ider them well before he rejects them intirely; and whether there be any better for him. It can do him no great harm to try a month or two; if he does, I flatter my&s;elf he will find that cu&s;tom will take off the greate&s;t part of the grievance, and per&s;everance make them not only tolerable but plea&s;ant. If he thinks health may be enjoyed upon ea&s;ier terms, I fear he will be mi&s;erably deceived; for health, like beauty, may be won by our own attention, efforts and a&s;&s;iduities, but cannot be had by purcha&s;e. Whoever thinks to buy either, will have the misfortune to find it not long his own, though he has paid for it.</P>
<P>But there may be others whom long &s;uffering has made more patient and rea&s;onable; the&s;e may be glad to hear that a little health is to be had on any terms; and it may be very comfortable to them to know that there is &s;carcely any &s;tate of weakne&s;s &s;o low, &s;uppo&s;ing the vitals not mortally hurt, from which they may not recover into very de&s;irable health and &s;trength, and by the&s;e means, exerted with per&s;evering patience. I &s;ay this to invalids in general: for thus may be cured not only the gout, but very bad rheumati&s;ms, i&s;chiaticas, rickets, &s;tone, jaundice, drop&s;y, a&s;thma, cachexies, and complications of many kinds. Whatever chronic di&s;ea&s;es will not give way to this &s;y&s;tem of medication, will be found, I greatly fear, too hard for any other. And &s;hould there be a particular ca&s;e, in which &s;ome fortunate violence or chance may have apparently &s;uc|ceeded

for a time, the return of the evil, or change to &s;omething wor&s;e, can no way be &s;o well guarded again&s;t and prevented, as by &s;ome &s;uch rational and natural in&s;titution of life.</P>
<P>Thus have I endeavoured to &s;et forth the real cau&s;es of chronic di&s;ea&s;es in general, and the true principles of convale&s;cence, health and longevity. If I have ha|zarded any thing new or contrary to received opinions, it has been from a thorough conviction of it's truth, however dangerous to fame and fortune; both which I know are more ea&s;ily acquired by complying with the world, than attempting to reform it: but it mu&s;t be &s;omebody equally indifferent to both, as I am, who will venture to tell &s;uch truths as are more likely to recoil and hurt the author, than to convince and con|ciliate the bulk of mankind.</P>
