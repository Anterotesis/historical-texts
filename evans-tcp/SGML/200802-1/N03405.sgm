<P>_IT is at the Call of the late honourable <HI>Hou&s;e of Re|pre&s;entatives,</HI> that I &s;tand in this Desk to Day; and it is my Purpo&s;e (in a humble Dependance on divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance) from the Words which I have now read in this great Audience, to di&s;cour&s;e of the Degeneracies, that the People of this Land are fallen into, and to urge all Orders of Men both <HI>civil</HI> and <HI>&s;acred,</HI> to endeavour a Reformation of what is am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">.

<P><PB N="2" REF="004153_0005_1003D683367BD870">Some have cho&s;en thus to do rather than to in|&s;i&s;t upon any Subject, that had a direct A&s;pect on the Affairs of the Day, and the Duty of the Electors to have a &s;pecial Regard to the Qualities of Councellors in the Choice of 'em. And the Rea&s;on (it &s;eems) that has influenced them, was this, <Q>Becau&s;e they look'd upon it as an Impro|priety, and altogether in vain to &s;peak of ne|ce&s;&s;ary Qualities, when the Per&s;ons them&s;elves are already fix'd upon, and (in Effect) cho&s;en before this; and that perhaps without any Re|gard to their Qualities, only that they are &s;uch as will be &s;ure to an&s;wer that Party-Cau&s;e and Intere&s;t they are de&s;igned for. But this is a Rea&s;on, that I utterly di&s;claim, in what I am going about; and would hope quite other Things, and better Things, of the honourable Per&s;ons, that are concerned in the Elections of this Day</Q>.</P>
<P>This Book wherein we find our Text, is &s;o full of divine Maje&s;ty, that it commands an awful Re|verence in all gracious Hearts that read it. It was indited by Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf, the faithful and true Witne&s;s. <HI>John</HI> the beloved and bo&s;om Di&s;ci|ple, and la&s;t Apo&s;tle, was the Pen-man of it. Chap. i. Ver. I. <HI>The Revelation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which God gave unto him, to &s;how unto his Servants Things which mu&s;t &s;hortly come to pa&s;s; and he &s;ent and &s;ignified it by his angel unto his Servant John.</HI></P>
<P>For the Time of his writing it, him&s;elf tells us, <HI>Chap.</HI> i.9. That it was while he was in P<HI>atmos,</HI> for the Word of God, and the Te&s;timony of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. This was (if we may believe Hi&s;tory, and we have nothing el&s;e to inform us) in the Time of Domitian the Roman Emperor, about the ninety-fourth or ninety-fifth Year after the Nativity of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="004153_0006_1003D69A4D7C5CB0">The Things which <HI>John</HI> de&s;cribes and writes are of two Sorts, as Chri&s;t him&s;elf ranks them, Chap. i.19. viz. Fir&s;t, The Things that are. Secondly, The Things that &s;hall be hereafter.</P>
<P><HI>The Things that are,</HI> have a Re&s;pect to the State of the &s;even <HI>A&s;ian</HI> Churches, &s;ignified by the &s;even Golden-Candle&s;ticks, vi&s;ionally repre&s;ented unto the beloved Apo&s;tle; for &s;o our Lord him&s;elf ex|pounds the Vi&s;ion, Ch. i, 20. <HI>The &s;even Candle&s;ticks which thou &s;awe&s;t, are the &s;even Churches.</HI></P>
<P>Now the Things which concern the&s;e &s;even Churches, are laid down in &s;even particular Epi&s;|tles, directed primarily to the &s;even Angels of the &s;even Churches. Secondarily, With and in them, to the &s;even Churches them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Our Text lies in the fir&s;t of the Epi&s;tles, in&s;cri|bed unto the Angel of the Church of <HI>Ephe&s;us, Chap.</HI> ii.I. I will not here wa&s;te my Time with any Di&s;|cour&s;e concerning the Situation of the City of <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> nor yet with a Re&s;olution of the Context by any analytical Expo&s;ition of the Epi&s;tle.</P>
<P>In the Words before us, our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf highly offended at the Church of <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> for an Apo&s;tacy whereinto they were a|pace degenerating. An Apo&s;tacy was the Thing complained of; and the Remedy pre&s;cribed for the Cure of that Malady, and to which this Church was exhorted, was Repentance. <HI>Remember from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the fir&s;t Works.</HI></P>
<P>This Repentance is pre&s;&s;ed with a dreadful Commination, big with Wo and Mi&s;ery. The
<PB N="4" REF="004153_0007_1003D6B3A7DFC380">
Judgment threatned, is no le&s;s than the Removal of the Candle&s;tick out of it's Place; which means our Lord's unchurching them, &amp; &s;aying unto them, <HI>Loammi, you are not my People.</HI> What the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t in our Text &s;ays to the Church of <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> is this, <HI>Repent,</HI> and by Repentance reco|ver out of thy Apo&s;tacy; or el&s;e I will di&s;church thee, di&s;own thee, de&s;troy thee.</P>
<P>But then in this Threatning, this Promi&s;e is &s;trongly implied, <HI>viz.</HI> that if this Church did thus re|pent, their Church-State &s;hould graciou&s;ly be con|tinued unto them.</P>
<P>Accordingly, from the Words, the&s;e three Doc|trines may be ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>DOCT. 1. That it is the great Duty of apo&s;ta|tizing Churches to remember from whence they are fallen, and repent, and do their fir&s;t Works. <HI>Remember from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the fir&s;t Works.</HI></P>
<P>DOCT. 2. That if declining Churches thus do, the Lord Je&s;us will graciou&s;ly continue their Church State unto them.</P>
<P>DOCT. 3. That unle&s;s apo&s;tatizing Churches do repent, they will provoke the Lord Je&s;us to un|church them, and de&s;troy them. <HI>I will remove thy Candle&s;tick out of his Place, except thou repent.</HI></P>
<P>To each of the&s;e in their Order.</P>
<P><HI>DOCT. I.</HI> It is the great Duty of apo&s;tatizing Churches to remember from whence they are fallen, and repent, and do their fir&s;t Works.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="004153_0008_1003D6C5800A6FE0">This Doctrine may be &s;poken unto, under the&s;e two Heads or Propo&s;itions.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> Churches have many times been guilty of Declen|&s;ions and Apo&s;tacies.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> When they become thus guilty, it is their great Duty to remember from whence they are fallen, and repent, and do their fir&s;t Works.</P>
<P>PROP. I. Churches have many times been guilty of Declen&s;ions and Apo&s;tacies.</P>
<P>So it was with the Church of I&s;rael. How fre|quently do we find God complaining of this, by the Mouth of his holy Prophets? They turned quickly out of the Way which their Fathers walk|ed in, obeying the Commandments of the Lord; but they did not &s;o. They were planted by God a noble Vine, wholly a right Seed; but they turn|ed into the degenerate Plant of a &s;trange unto him, <HI>Jer.</HI> ii.21.</P>
<P>And as it was thus with the Church of God un|der the <HI>legal Di&s;pen&s;ation,</HI> &s;o it has been with many chri&s;tian Churches under the <HI>evangelical.</HI> During the Days of the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves, and notwith|standing their wi&s;e, diligent and careful In&s;pection over the Churches planted by them; yet there were Declen&s;ions in many of them. And in &s;uc|ceeding Ages, far greater Defections from the Go&s;|pel befell the Churches of Chri&s;t, agreeable to what tho&s;e holy Men of God foretold.</P>
<P>Apo&s;tacies and Declen&s;ions among Churches, have appeared &s;everal Ways.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="6" REF="004153_0009_1003D6DE04B45C68">I. <HI>Sometimes in Matters of Doctrine.</HI> They re|ject Knowlege, which is the fir&s;t Step to Piety, and without which the Mind can't be good. They re|nounce and for&s;ake the Truths of the Go&s;pel, which is the very Ground-Work of Holine&s;s. And this they do two Ways.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>By Ignorance.</HI> A knowing intelligent People in Continuance of Time, may become ignorant at Children in Under&s;tanding! 'Twas thus with the People of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> Ho&s;. iv.I. <HI>There is no Knowlege of God in the Land.</HI> It &s;peaks the univer&s;al Igno|rance that was among them. Babes may s;ucceed tho&s;e, who by Rea&s;on of U&s;e, had their Sen&s;es ex|erci&s;ed to di&s;cern between Good and Evil. And this may proceed &s;ometimes from &s;uitable Means being withheld from a People. Family In&s;truction is neglected, a due Care to catechi&s;e the ri&s;ing Ge|neration in the Principles of Religion, is not main|tained; neither are Schools of Learning for their religious Education, cheri&s;hed as they ought to be; and if the Guides and Teachers of a People &s;hould prove unable, or unfaithful to teach them the good Knowlege of the Lord, no wonder if they be ig|norant.</P>
<P>Sometimes a People's Ignorance proceeds from their own Sloth and Negligence. They will not improve the Means of In&s;truction, which they are favoured with. Neglect the Reading of God's holy Word; will not &s;eek the Law at the Mouth of their able and faithful Guides; are not careful to give their Attendance on their publick and private In|&s;tructions. Hence when <HI>for the Time they ought to be Teachers, they have need that one &s;hould teach them again, the fir&s;t Principles of the Oracles of God; and are become &s;uch as have need of Milk, and not of &s;trong Meat.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="7" REF="004153_0010_1003D6F18546F3C0">2. <HI>By Errors.</HI> They fall from the Truth which they have heard and received, and turn a&s;ide to lies. This in a &s;ad Degree was the Ca&s;e of the Church of <HI>Corinth.</HI> It was planted by the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> who we may be &s;ure, kept back nothing that was profitable unto them. They were watered by <HI>Apollos,</HI> an eloquent Man and mighty in the Scrip|tures, &amp; therefore beyond Que&s;tion fully in&s;tructed by them in all the Principles of Religion; and yet many of them quickly fell into that fundamental Error of denying the <HI>Re&s;urrection of the Dead,</HI> I Cor. xv.</P>
<P>A yet more pregnant In&s;tance of what we have now under Con&s;ideration, are the Churches of <HI>Ga|latia.</HI> Planted they were by the Mini&s;try of the &s;ame Apo&s;le; and tho' he declared unto them the whole Coun&s;el of God, yet we may well think, that in nothing did he labour more than to e&s;tab|li&s;h them in the Knowlege and Belief of that grand Article of Chri&s;tianity, The Ju&s;tification of Sinners by Faith in the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t; for this was the principal Scope &amp; De&s;ign of his Mini&s;try, in the whole Cour&s;e of it. This Doctrine was em|braced with &s;uch Joy and Satisfaction, that they prized the Apo&s;tle as an Angel of God, received him as Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and valued him above the Sight of their own Eyes, <HI>Chap.</HI> iv.14, 15. And yet after all this, on a &s;udden, to his Surprize and Amazement, they renounced the Doctrine of Ju&s;ti|fication by Faith only, to &s;eek after a Righteou&s;|ne&s;s, as it were, by the Works of the Law. Gal. i.6, 7. <HI>I marvel, that ye are &s;o &s;oon removed from him that called you into the Grace of Chris;t, unto ano|ther Go&s;pel: Which is not another; but there be &s;ome that trouble you, and would pervert the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="004153_0011_1003D7072FDF5348">There are abundance of Temptations to Errors. There are Temptations from <HI>without.</HI> Satan is the grand Seducer, and &s;tands continually ready to act his Part to the utmo&s;t, for the Delu&s;ion of Men. 2 Cor. iv.4. <HI>The God of this World hath blinded their Minds.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, There are heretical Teachers, that bend their Wits, and bu&s;y them&s;elves in wre&s;ting the Scriptures, and venting their dangerous Errors, to the De&s;truction of them&s;elves and many others. 2 Pet. ii.1. <HI>There
&s;hall be fal&s;e Teachers among you, who &s;hall privily bring in damnable Here&s;ies.</HI></P>
<P>And there are many Temptations from <HI>within,</HI> as well as from without. The uncured Enmity in the Minds of carnal Men to &s;piritual Things, be|trays them into erroneous Tenets; and &s;o does the Pride of Rea&s;on, rendring them unwilling to ad|mit any Doctrines in Chri&s;tianity, which are not level with it: Their vain Affectation of appearing &s;ome great ones, and the Power and Prevalency of other vile Lu&s;ts and Corruptions.</P>
<P>Many Errors have prevailed in the Church of God. Particularly, <HI>Ariani&s;m</HI> has &s;o done, and &s;o has <HI>Pelagiani&s;m,</HI> and <HI>Popery,</HI> and <HI>Sociniani&s;m</HI> and <HI>Arminiani&s;m,</HI> which la&s;t is, (as a learned Man ob&s;erves<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Edwards</HI> in his Theol. Refor. Vol. 2. p. 491.</NOTE>) the &s;econd Edition of <HI>Pelagiani&s;m,</HI> Pelagiani&s;m in Miniature, and a compendious Draught of it.</P>
<P N="2">2. Sometimes Churches are guilty of Apo&s;tacy in Point of Worship.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="004153_0012_1003D72707643640">And this &s;everal Ways.</P>
<P N="1">1. By corrupting the Wor&s;hip of God.</P>
<P>And there are e&s;pecially two Things, which corrupt it.</P>
<P>One is, an Admittance of Per&s;ons to that Wor|&s;hip of God, which they are unfit for, and have no Right unto. There are two Sorts of Wor&s;hip with which Men are to glorify God: A <HI>natural</HI> and an <HI>in&s;tituted</HI> Wor&s;hip. As for <HI>natural Wor&s;hip</HI> (&s;uch as hearing the Word &amp; Prayer) it is every Man's immediate Duty to attend upon it. But it is o|therwi&s;e with <HI>in&s;tituted Wor&s;hip.</HI> Men ought to be prepared and made meet for it, before they attend it. When <HI>John</HI> &s;aw the Phari&s;ees and Scribes come to his Bapti&s;m, he &s;aid unto them, <HI>O Genera|tion of Vipers, Who hath warned you to flee from the Wrath to come? Bring forth therefore Fruits meet for Repentance.</HI> 1 Cor. xi.28. <HI>But let a Man examine him&s;elf, and &s;o let him eat of that Bread, and drink of that Cup.</HI> Whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>holy Things</HI> are given unto <HI>Dogs,</HI> the holy In&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ions of Chri&s;t to &s;uch as are vi&s;ibly unclean, this is to corrupt them. Ezek. xliv.7. <HI>Ye have brought into my Sanctuary Strangers uncir|cumci&s;ed in Heart, and uncircumci&s;ed in Fle&s;h, to be in my Sanctuary to pollute it, even my Hou&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>The other Thing that corrupts the Wor&s;hip of God, is the <HI>adding to it,</HI> or <HI>taking from it.</HI> To cur|tail the Wor&s;hip of God, and dimini&s;h from it; mu&s;t needs deprave it. And &s;o does the Addition of any humane In&s;titutions to it. Men are very prone to interweave their own Inventions and &s;ig|nificant Ceremonies into, and make them Parts of the Wor&s;hip of God, thinking thereby to mend
<PB N="10" REF="004153_0013_1003D73405D1BF00">
it: but as this is an Inva&s;ion on his Sovereignty, and a great Reflection ca&s;t upon his Wi&s;dom and Faithfulne&s;s; &s;o it mars his Wor&s;hip, and &s;poils its Beauty, and makes it to be to little or no Purpo&s;e. Matth. xv.9. <HI>But in vain do they wor&s;hip me, teach|ing for Doctrines, the Commandments of Men.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. By neglecting the Wor&s;hip of God, or any Part of it.</P>
<P>And here particularly,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Sometimes &s;ecret Wor&s;hip is neglecled.</HI> Many do not yield a due Ob&s;ervance to that plain and expre&s;s Injunction of our Lord, Matth. vi.6. <HI>En|ter into thy Clo&s;et, and when thou ha&s;t &s;hut thy Door, pray to thy Father which is in Secret.</HI> Nor do they walk as he walked, who was frequently engaged in the Duty of &s;ecret Prayer. Of our ble&s;&s;ed Sa|viour we read, Matth. xiv.23. <HI>He went apart to pray: and when the Evening was come, he was alone.</HI> And Mark i.35. <HI>In the Morning he departed into a &s;olitary Place,. and there prayed.</HI> Perhaps &s;omething of this is done by Fits and Starts; but they don't ob&s;erve any &s;et &s;olemn Times, Morning and Even|ing, for this great Duty. Or when it is thus attend|ed, yet it may be, many neglect that which is of the mo&s;t per&s;onal and &s;pecial Concernment to their own Souls. Per&s;ons may pray in Secret, and yet not utter a Word which is of mo&s;t &s;ecret Con|cernment to them&s;elves, and their own Souls; but what may be expre&s;&s;ed before a Family or Con|gregation. And thus one principal End of &s;ecret Prayer is lo&s;t; viz. the Confe&s;&s;ion of &s;ecret Sins, and petitioning for tho&s;e per&s;onal Mercies and &s;e|cret Ble&s;&s;ings, which we cannot &s;o properly and conveniently ask before others.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="11" REF="004153_0014_1003D73E59366050">2. <HI>Sometimes Family-Wor&s;hip and Duties are neg|lected.</HI> As the offering up the morning and even|ing Sacrifice of Prayer and Prai&s;e; the Reading of God's Word daily; and in&s;tructing the Family by catechi&s;ing, and other &s;utable and profitable Means, as is required, <HI>Deut.</HI> vi.7. And this Neg|lect in &s;ome Families may be total, in others par|tial. Family-Duties may be wholly omitted in &s;ome Families, and in others, but in Part perform|ed. If there be Prayer on the Lord's Day, yet little or none all the Week after. If in the Morn|ing, yet none in the Evening; or if in the Even|ing, yet none in the Morning; or if in the Morn|ing and Evening, yet the &s;olemn Reading God's Word is not made a Part of the daily Family|Wor&s;hip; or if the&s;e be attended, yet perhaps a careful in&s;tructing of the Children of the Family is neglected, or not duly performed.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Sometimes the publick Wor&s;hip of God is di&s;re|garded.</HI> His Authority enjoining it is &s;lighted; the &s;acred Provi&s;ions of Sion are de&s;pi&s;ed; and the publick A&s;&s;emblies of God's People on the Lord's Days, as well as on Lecture Days, are not attended, as &s;hould be. Some are &s;o far from keeping God's Sabbaths, and reverencing his Sanc|tuary, by a con&s;tant Attendance on the Wor&s;hip of it; that they are &s;eldom there at all. Some are ready to content them&s;elves with going up to the Hou&s;e of God, on one Part of the Lord's Day only. And others come very un&s;ea&s;onably, to the depriv|ing them&s;elves of &s;ome Part of the publick Wor|&s;hip; and the Di&s;traction and drawing off the Minds of others, from that Part of it, which is in Hand. Men, that they may indulge an indolent Spirit, are very forward to frame Excu&s;es, to &s;tay away from the Hou&s;e of God. Light Indi&s;po&s;iti|ons
<PB N="12" REF="004153_0015_1003D746865A2CC8">
Body, &s;mall Difficulties of the Weather, and Di&s;tance of the Way, which would be ea&s;ily over|look'd, to compa&s;s a worldly De&s;ign, to obtain &s;ome worldly Advantage, will keep them at Home. So Men for&s;ake the Lord, and forget his holy Mountain.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>By Formality in the Wor&s;hip of God.</HI> A pro|fe&s;&s;ing People are many Times &s;uperficial in divine Wor&s;hip. It is external, and not animated with &s;piritual Frames, which are the Soul of it. They have with the Church of <HI>Sardis</HI> a Name to live, but are dead. A Form of Godline&s;s, but deny the Power thereof. They celebrate <HI>Sabbaths,</HI> and yet have no &s;piritual Re&s;t: Ob&s;erve <HI>Fa&s;ts</HI> without godly Sorrow and Brokenne&s;s of Heart for Sin; keep <HI>Thank&s;givings,</HI> without a thankful Heart, or holy Rejoycing in God. They draw near to God with their Mouth, and with their Lips do honour him, while their Hearts are removed from him. They put off God with external Services, but little regard to yield him a rea&s;onable one, i. e. directed by their Under&s;tandings, and accompanied with their Affections. To Appearance they are devout in attending on Ordinances, yet little or nothing of &s;incere Devotion in their Wor&s;hip. Ezek. xxxiii.31. <HI>They come to thee, as the People cometh, and they &s;it before thee, as my People, and they hear thy Words, but they will not do them; for with their Mouth they &s;hew much Love, but their Heart goeth after their Co|vetou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Sometimes Churches are guilty of Apo&s;tacy in Point of Di&s;cipline.</HI></P>
<P>Here I might &s;ay,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="13" REF="004153_0016_1003D74B99B325B8">I. <HI>Sometimes there is a great Neglect of Family|Di&s;cipline and Government among a profe&s;&s;ing People.</HI> The Authority with which Heads of Families are ve&s;ted by God, is not maintained, nor exerted by them, as ought to be. Many chri&s;tian <HI>Hou&s;holders</HI> don't practice as <HI>Abraham</HI> did, of whom God gives this Commendation, Gen. xviii.19. <HI>I know him, that he will command his Children, and his Hou&s;hold after him, and they &s;hall keep the Way of the Lord, to do Ju&s;tice and Judgment.</HI> They are very remi&s;s, in exerci&s;ing a due Government over their Chil|dren and Servants. Don't rule well their own Hou&s;es. Children are &s;uffered to frequent the Ta|verns, get into bad Company, to ramble up and down in the Evening, when they &s;hould be at Home to attend Family-Wor&s;hip; in the dark and &s;ilent Night, when they &s;hould be in their Beds. They are let alone, to run into Temptations to Sin, and take bad Cour&s;es without Check or Controul. <HI>They make them&s;elves vile,</HI> and their Parents <HI>re&s;train them not.</HI></P>
<P>But then,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Sometimes Churches grow very carele&s;s in Church-Di&s;cipline.</HI> The Power of Di&s;cipline, which is Chri&s;t's own Expedient for the Pre&s;ervation of Churches in Purity, is not kept up as it &s;hould be, and as it has been. "The Snuffers of the Sanctu|ary are not regularly and faithfully u&s;ed; hence the Gold of the Candle&s;ticks becomes Dro&s;s a|pace". Churches can bear with tho&s;e that are Evil. They are not careful to <HI>purge out the old Leaven</HI>; and to make a Separation between the <HI>Precious and the Vile, the Clean and Unclean.</HI> Per|&s;ons don't in brotherly Love, watch over one ano|thers Souls faithfully, and as they ought to do. That in Lev. xix.17. <HI>Thou &s;halt not hate thy Bro|ther
<PB N="14" REF="004153_0017_1003D7615FFA9988">
in thine Heart: Thou &s;halt in any wi&s;e rebuke thy Neighbour, and not &s;uffer Sin upon him</HI>; has not it's due Influence upon them. They are not careful to attend Chri&s;t's Rule and Expedient laid down in <HI>Matth.</HI> xviii. for the healing and removing pri|vate Offences. They too often vent their own Pride and Pa&s;&s;ions, and &s;erve their own Humours; in&s;tead of dealing with their offending Brother, in a humble, meek, compa&s;&s;ionate and tender Way for his Recovery.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>A profe&s;&s;ing People are &s;ometimes guilty of Dege|neracy, in Re&s;pect of Life and Conver&s;ation.</HI> Practi|cal Religion runs low among them, they grow very corrupt in their Morals. Temptations to Sin are multiplied, and Men give way to 'em, and are overcome by 'em, and evil Practices prevail a|mong them. <HI>The Love of many waxes cold,</HI> and Sin and Iniquity abounds. Pride, Contempt of, and Di&s;obedience to Superiours, Contention, Idlene&s;s, Intemperance, Uncleanne&s;s, inordinate Pa&s;&s;ions, &s;inful Heats and Hatreds, Backbitings, Tale-bear|ing, Want of Truth, Promi&s;e-breaking, inordinate Affection to the World, Inju&s;tice, Oppre&s;&s;ion, and Strait-handedne&s;s as to publick Concerns. Their Carriage is not as becomes the Go&s;pel. Their Be|haviour does not adorn, but brings a Reproach up|on the Profe&s;&s;ion, which they make, I&s;ai. i.4. <HI>Ab &s;inful Nation, a People laden with Iniquity, a Seed of Evil-doers, Children that are Corrupters, they have for&s;aken the Lord, they have provoked the holy one of I&s;rael unto Anger, they are gone backward.</HI></P>
<P>Thus Churches, or a profe&s;&s;ing People, many times become guilty of Declen&s;ions and Apo&s;tacies. I come now to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="15" REF="004153_0018_1003D77B759CDA80">2. <HI>That when Churches are thus guilty, it is their great Duty to remember from whence they are fallen, and repent, and do their fir&s;t Works.</HI></P>
<P>And here,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>They &s;hould remember from whence they are fal|len.</HI> That is, in what Degree their Purity &amp; Pie|ty was formerly, and compare it with what it is now. This will help them to a clearer Di&s;covery of their &s;ad Declen&s;ions and Decays; and may be &s;erviceable to forward their Repentance. So the Lord's People of old, comparing the Glory of the fir&s;t Temple with that of the latter, and finding this as nothing to that, they wept with a loud Voice. Compare <HI>Hagai</HI> ii.3. with <HI>Ezra</HI> iii.12.</P>
<P>But,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>They mu&s;t repent of their Sins, by which they have apo&s;tatized from God.</HI></P>
<P>Here I will briefly con&s;ider the Nature of this great Duty, to which declining Churches are &s;trong|ly obliged. Now Repentance includes in it,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>A thorough Conviction of the Evil that there is in Sin again&s;t God.</HI></P>
<P>Sin is contrary to the holy Law, Nature &amp; Glo|ry of God. By &s;inning Men make void God's Law, ca&s;t off his Government, trample upon his Sovereignty, de&s;pi&s;e his Wi&s;dom, Goodne&s;s, Ho|line&s;s, and Omni&s;cience. When Men &s;in, they &s;light the Promi&s;es of God, by which he would al|lure them to Obedience; and &s;et at nought his terrible Power and Ju&s;tice, as if they might &s;in and yet &s;ecure them&s;elves from his Indignation. By Sin God's glorious Attributes are denied or con|temned, and he is greatly wronged. And it was
<PB N="16" REF="004153_0019_1003D7B070D51170">
this, that pierced and wounded our Saviour, yea, broke his Heart and fetch'd from him that bitter Exclamation when upon the Cro&s;s, <HI>My God! My God! Why ha&s;t thou for&s;aken me?</HI> Moreover, it's what grieves the kind and good Spirit, <HI>Eph.</HI> iv.30. Now a Sight and Sen&s;e of the Evil of Sin in the&s;e Re&s;pects, is fir&s;tly implied in Repentance. Where|as many are &s;o fooli&s;h, as to <HI>make a Mock at Sin,</HI> to think &s;lightly about it; the true Penitent has quite other Thoughts of it, and beholds it, as ex|ceeding &s;inful.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>True Repentance includes in it, godly Sorrow for Sin. 2 Cor.</HI> vii.10. Some have grieved for Sin, and yet have had nothing of this godly Sorrow for Sin. Their Grief proceeds from the Apprehen&s;ion of the Wrath and Cur&s;e of God which pur&s;ues them, and is ready to &s;eize on them. This is a legal Sorrow, a grieving for Sin as again&s;t a Man's &s;elf; becau&s;e it has betrayed him to Death and Damnation. In this Sen&s;e, Hypocrites, yea, Reprobates may &s;or|row and mourn for Sin. <HI>Judas</HI> repented him&s;elf, &s;aying, <HI>I have &s;inned, in that I have betrayed the in|nocent Blood,&mdash; and went and hanged him&s;elf,</HI> Mat. xxvii.3, 4, 5. But godly Sorrow is a &s;aving Grace of the Spirit, and has Sin as a Wrong to God for the Object of it. So the <HI>penitent Prodigal,</HI> when his Heart was truly broken within him, he came to his Father, and &s;ays, <HI>I have &s;inned again&s;t Heaven, and in thy Sight,</HI> Luke xv.21. 'Twas the Wrong that he had done to the God of Heaven, that trou|bled him. And this was that which &s;at &s;o heavy upon <HI>David</HI>'s mournful Soul, P&s;alm li.4. <HI>Again&s;t thee, thee only have I &s;inned, and done this Evil in thy Sight.</HI></P>
<P>Again, Godly Sorrow is a mourning for Sin, as it has wounded our Saviour, Zech. xii.10. <HI>I will
<PB N="17" REF="004153_0020_1003D7C6349D5C40">
pour upon the Hou&s;e of David, and upon the Inhabi|tants of Jeru&s;alem, the Spirit of Grace and Supplica|tion, and they &s;hall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they &s;hall mourn for him, as one that mourneth for his only Son, and &s;hall be in Bitterne&s;s for him, as one that is in Bitterne&s;s for his Fir&s;t-born.</HI> The true Penitent, realizing the Death and Suffer|ings of his Saviour, and con&s;idering that it was his Sins, that were the procuring, meritorious Cau&s;e of them; therefore does he lament and bewail them.</P>
<P>Once more, The true Penitent grieves for his Sins, becau&s;e thereby he has grieved the Spirit of God. The &s;erious Con&s;ideration of the Benefits which he has received from this kind and good Spirit, and of his unworthy &amp; di&s;ingenuous Carri|age towards him, opens the Springs of his Sorrow, and melts his Heart into the Current of evangeli|cal Mourning for Sin.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Another Thing included in Repentance, is an Hatred of Sin.</HI> Natural Men love their Sins, and roul them as a &s;weet Mor&s;el under their Tongues: They are as dear to them, as their right Hands, or right Eyes. But in Repentance, this Love is turned into Hatred. Hence &s;ays <HI>David,</HI> P&s;alm cxix.104. <HI>I hate every fal&s;e Way.</HI> The true Peni|tent hates the Name, and abhors the Nature of Sin. Yea, he loaths him&s;elf upon the Account of it. Job xlii.6. <HI>I abhor my &s;elf, and repent in Du&s;t and A&s;hes.</HI> Ezek. xxxvi.3I. <HI>Then &s;hall ye remember your own evil Ways, and your Doings that were not good, and &s;hall loath your &s;elves in your own Sight, for your Iniquities, and for your Abominations.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Another Thing included in Repentance, is Shame for Sin.</HI> Sin is a mo&s;t &s;hameful Thing, whether
<PB N="18" REF="004153_0021_1003D62AA1ACC5F8">
we con&s;ider it in Relation to our &s;elves, or in Re&s;|pect to God, again&s;t whom, and in who&s;e &s;ight it is committed. And yet &s;uch is the Blindne&s;s of Men's Minds by Nature, that they glory in it. <HI>Phil.</HI> iii.19. But the true Penitent &s;ees the Ba&s;e|ne&s;s of the Thing; and the Di&s;grace and Di&s;ho|nour, Infamy and Reproach that he has brought upon him&s;elf thereby; and is covered with Con|fu&s;ion at the Thoughts of it. Thus <HI>Ezra</HI> te&s;tified his Repentance, Chap. ix.6. <HI>O my God, I am a|&s;hamed, and blu&s;h to lift up my Face to thee, my God: For our Iniquities are increa&s;ed over our Heads, and our Tre&s;pa&s;s is grown up unto the Heavens.</HI> And &s;o the <HI>Publican,</HI> Luke xviii.13. <HI>Who &s;tanding afar off, would not lift up &s;o much as his Eyes to Heaven, but &s;mote upon his Brea&s;t, &s;aying, God be merciful to me a Sinner.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>True Repentance is attended with a free and hearty Confe&s;&s;ion of Sin.</HI> Thus practi&s;ed <HI>David,</HI> P&s;alm xxxviii.18. <HI>For I will declare mine Iniquity, I will be &s;orry for my Sin.</HI> So P&s;alm li.3. <HI>For I ac|knowlege my Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and my Sin is ever before me.</HI> He that will not &s;o much as confe&s;s his Sins to God, and own that it would be a righteous Thing with him to inflict upon him the Puni&s;h|ment which he de&s;erves; can never be thought to repent of them, or &s;hare in his Mercy. <HI>He that covereth his Sins, &s;hall not pro&s;per: but who&s;o confe&s;|&s;eth and for&s;aketh them, &s;hall find Mercy.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. and finally, <HI>That Repentance which the Go&s;pel calls for, includes in it a turning from, and for&s;aking of Sin.</HI> 1 Kings viii.35. <HI>If they turn from their Sin,&mdash;forgive the Sin of thy Servants.</HI> And where there is unfeigned and thorough Repentance, there is a turning not only from &s;ome, but all Sins; Ezek.
<PB N="19" REF="004153_0022_1003D7EF0FA17318">
xviii.30. <HI>Repent and turn your &s;elves from all your Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, &s;o Iniquity &s;hall not be your Ruin,</HI> One Sin allowed of, or indulged, is incon&s;i&s;tent with true Repentance. And this turning from Sin, mu&s;t not be only for a Time, but for ever. Ho&s;. xiv.8. <HI>Ephraim &s;hall &s;ay, What have I to do any more with Idols?</HI></P>
<P>Thus I have de&s;cribed the Nature of that Re|pentance, which Churches when back&s;liden from God, are called upon to practice.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>They mu&s;t do their fir&s;t Works.</HI> <Q>They mu&s;t as it were begin again, go back &s;tep by &s;tep, till they come to the Place where they took the fir&s;t fal&s;e &s;tep</Q>.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Henry</HI> in loc.</NOTE> They mu&s;t endea|vour to recover their primitive Purity of <HI>Doctrine,</HI> of <HI>Wor&s;hip,</HI> of <HI>Di&s;cipline,</HI> and <HI>Morals.</HI> They mu&s;t revive their fir&s;t Love to God and their Brethren, and regain their former Zeal for good Works. And this may &s;uffice for the fir&s;t Doctrine.</P>
<P>I proceed now to the &s;econd Doctrine, viz.</P>
<P>DOCT. II. <HI>That if declining Churches thus do, the Lord Je&s;us will graciou&s;ly continue their Church-State unto them.</HI></P>
<P>Their Candle&s;tick then &s;hall not be removed out of it's Place, nor will the Lord remove his Go&s;pel-Mini&s;ters and Ordinances from them. It may be &s;aid of Churches, as it is &s;aid of a Nation or King|dom, in Jer. xviii.7, 8. <HI>At what In&s;tant the Lord &s;peaks concerning them, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to de&s;troy them</HI>; <HI>if</HI> &s;uch Churches <HI>again&s;t whom
<PB N="20" REF="004153_0023_1003D8079962BFB0">
he hath pronounced turn from their Evil, he will re|pent of the Evil, that he thought to do unto them.</HI> When back&s;liding Churches return to God, he will return to them. Mal. iii.7. <HI>Even from the Days of your Fathers, ye are gone away from mine Ordinances, and have not kept them: return unto me, and I will return unto you.</HI> The Lord will a&s;&s;uredly, be with his profe&s;&s;ing People, while they are with him. 2 Chron. xv.2. <HI>Hear ye me A&s;a, and all Judah and Benjamin, the Lord is with you, while ye be with him.</HI> And if all manner of Ble&s;&s;ings are enwrapped in this ble&s;&s;ed Pre&s;ence of God; then &s;urely a Peo|ple's &s;acred <HI>Immunities</HI> and <HI>Privileges.</HI></P>
<P>While Churches continue golden Candle&s;ticks, the Lord Je&s;us will be in the mid&s;t of them, Rev. 5.i.13. And he will make it manife&s;t that he is &s;o, by the Protection and Defence vouch&s;afed to them. I&s;ai. xxvii.2, 3. <HI>In that Day &s;ing ye unto her, a Vine|yard of red Wine. I the Lord do keep it, &mdash; lea&s;t any hurt it, I will keep it Night and Day.</HI> Churches that are a Vineyard of red Wine, yielding the be&s;t and choice&s;t Grapes; &s;uch Churches are, and &s;hall always be, under the Wing of Chri&s;t's Protection. I the Lord that can do every thing, but cannot lie nor deceive, I do keep it; lea&s;t any hurt it. The&s;e Vineyards lie much expo&s;ed to Injury; there are many that would hurt them, tread them down, and lay them wa&s;te: But God their Saviour will &s;uffer no real Hurt or Damage to be done 'em, but what he will bring good out of. He will keep them con&s;tantly Night and Day, and not without Need; for their Enemies are re&s;tle&s;s, and unwearied in their Attempts and De&s;igns again&s;t them; and both Night and Day &s;eek an Oppor|tunity to do them a Mi&s;chief.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="004153_0024_1003D81E03A17180">While Churches continue Vineyards of red Wine, bringing forth Fruit to God; he will not &s;uffer per&s;ecuting Enemies to &s;catter them; nor Seducers and fal&s;e Teachers to mi&s;lead them. In a Word, The Gates of Hell, the Power and Poli|cy of Satan, and all his Agents and In&s;truments, &s;hall not prevail again&s;t them.</P>
<P>Moreover, Chri&s;t will vouch&s;afe the Tokens of his Pre&s;ence with &s;uch Churches, in watering, as well as in defending them; <HI>I will water it every Moment.</HI> He will &s;upply them with all nece&s;&s;ary Provi&s;ions; with his Ordinances, and the gracious Influences of his Holy Spirit. The &s;till and &s;ilent Dews of God's Grace and Ble&s;&s;ing, &s;hall continu|ally de&s;cend upon them, that they may bring forth much Fruit.</P>
<P>I come now to the third Doctrine.</P>
<P>DOCT. III. <HI>That unle&s;s apo&s;tatizing Churches do repent, they will provoke the Lord to unchurch them, and de&s;troy them.</HI></P>
<P>It's true, the <HI>catholick Church</HI> cannot be lo&s;t. There is a Promi&s;e concerning the Church in ge|neral, that it &s;hall never fail. It is built upon a Rock, and let the Gate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Hell do their wor&s;t, it &s;hall &s;tand, <HI>Matth.</HI> xvi.I8. Chri&s;t ever had, and ever will have a Church on Earth. We read con|cerning that City of God, that <HI>&s;he &s;hall not be mo|ved.</HI> And that <HI>the highe&s;t him&s;elf &s;hall e&s;tablish her.</HI> And concerning this Mount Zion, that it <HI>abideth for ever.</HI></P>
<P>But then a <HI>particular Church</HI> may fail, and there is not one particular Church, but what is liable to an utter Extirpation. Churches for their Sins and
<PB N="22" REF="004153_0025_1003D83ACB9944D0">
Defections may be unchurched, and Candle&s;ticks removed.</P>
<P>Many &s;ad and deplorable In&s;tances of this Nature may be produced.</P>
<P>So the golden Candle&s;tick of the <HI>jewi&s;h Church,</HI> was removed. They <HI>were broken off, becau&s;e of Un|belief.</HI> The Jews had the offer of Chri&s;t made un|to them; yea, the fir&s;t Offer, but they rejected it, and hereupon God rejected them, and the King|dom of God was taken from them, and in this woful Condition, do they remain to this Day.</P>
<P>Upon the Rejection of the <HI>Jews,</HI> the <HI>Gentiles</HI> were called in, and many Churches gathered out of them. And many of the&s;e Churches, for their grievous Neglects and Contempts of the Covenant of God, have been di&s;churched by him.</P>
<P>What <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> was threatned with in our Text, is fulfilled upon that, and the other &s;ix Churches of the le&s;&s;er <HI>A&s;ia.</HI> The Candle&s;ticks are removed out of their Places.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e once famous Churches that had a graci|ous and glorious Pre&s;ence of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t in them, for <HI>he walked in the mid&s;t of tho&s;e golden Candle&s;ticks</HI>; I &s;ay, the&s;e Churches have &s;inned a|way the Go&s;pel, and the Glory of a pure Church-State is taken from them. The Chri&s;tian Name, which yet they wear, is in a Manner all of Chri&s;|tianity that is left among them. They are woful|ly overwhelmed with Ignorance, Errors, Here&s;ies, Super&s;titions and Idolatry; and are now groaning under the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Oppre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>In other Parts of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> where the Go&s;pel has been preached, and Churches planted in the Days of the <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> they have lo&s;t the chri&s;tian Religi|on. Yea, the chri&s;tian Name among &s;ome of 'em, is not now to be found. Thus Darkne&s;s covers

<P>Time was, when there were thou&s;ands of glori|ous Churches in <HI>Africa,</HI> and many bright and &s;hi|ning Stars; among whom, Au&s;tin the renowned Bi&s;hop of Hippo, mu&s;t be accounted one of the fir&s;t Magnitude; but now, the Shadow of Death &s;tretches it &s;elf over tho&s;e once happy Regions of Light, and not a Church or Mini&s;ter to be &s;een there.</P>
<P>Look we now into <HI>Europe,</HI> and here in <HI>Rome</HI> it &s;elf, there was a Church <HI>beloved of God, called to be Saints, who&s;e Faith was &s;poken of throughout the whole World,</HI> Rom i.7.

Or have we not by Degrees, turned into the degenerate Plant of a &s;trange Vine unto God? Have we not lo&s;t much of our fir&s;t Love, and of our primitive Purity, Piety and holy Strictne&s;s? If we compare our &s;elves with our pious <HI>Ance&s;tors,</HI> &s;hall we not find our&s;elves as much &s;unk below them, in point of true Worth and Excellency, as <HI>Re|boboam</HI>'s bra&s;en Shields were below <HI>Solomon</HI>'s gol|den ones? Are we not departing from <HI>the Faith once delivered to the Saints</HI>; and which was once clo&s;ely embraced, and highly prized, by the&s;e Churches? And is not <HI>Ignorance</HI> of God, and the Things of God, with <HI>Errors,</HI> the <HI>Arminian</HI> e&s;pecially, apace coming in among us? What a holy Heat, what a flaming Love, was found in the Hearts of the pri|mitive Chri&s;tians of this Land, to the Hou&s;e and Ordinances of God? And how careful and diligent were they, in attending the publick A&s;&s;emblies of God's People, on Lecture Days, as well as on the Lord's Days? But alas! Is not the Love of many in this Regard waxen cold? And is it not the Manner of many, to neglect the a&s;&s;embling of them&s;elves together? How &s;trict were they in keep|ing of Sabbaths, not &s;peaking their own Words? But is not the Re&s;t of the Sabbath now &s;adly di&s;turb|ed? Don't many take a mighty Liberty in their Di&s;cour&s;e on the Lord's Day? Don't they di&s;cour&s;e almo&s;t of any thing that they di&s;cour&s;e of on other Days? How careful were our dear Progenitors to offer up the morning and evening Sacrifice in their

Families, and of Reading the holy Scriptures to 'em, and in&s;tructing them from orthodox Catechi&s;ms? But is not Family-Wor&s;hip and In&s;truction fallen under great Decays among us, their degenerate Off|&s;pring? And if we are &s;o defective as to publick and private Wor&s;hip, can we rationally think that &s;ecret Wor&s;hip is better attended? The fir&s;t Plan|ters of this Land, and Members of the&s;e Churches, were Men eminent for vital, practical Religion: 'Twas God in his Ordinances, that they thir&s;ted and panted after: The Power of Godline&s;s then went with the Form of it. But is not our Religion, in a great degree degenerated into Rituality? Is it not in a great Mea&s;ure external, void of Life, Spirit and Power? <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI>'s Re&s;olution was the Re&s;olution of our pious Ance&s;tors, <HI>As for me and my Hou&s;e, we will &s;erve the Lord.</HI> Great was their Care to main|tain a wi&s;e and good Government over their Chil|dren and Servants: 'Twas their &s;tudy, that their Families might be well ordered Families. But is not Family-Government now almo&s;t lo&s;t &amp; gone? Time was when Di&s;cipline in the&s;e Churches, was upheld in the Power of it; and upon this account, they were <HI>beautiful as Tirzah, comely as Jeru&s;alem, terrible as an Army with Banners.</HI> But alas! How is it fallen now, and how remi&s;s are we grown? The Lives and Morals of our Fathers were &s;uch, as became the Go&s;pel. They were a humble, loving, peaceable, indu&s;trious, cha&s;t, temperate, &s;ober Peo|ple; greatly mortified to the World, willing that their Neighbours &s;hould thrive, as well as them&s;elves, true in their Words, faithful in their Promi&s;es, punctual in their Performances, hone&s;t &amp; ju&s;t in their Dealings &amp;c.

God's Election of his People to Glory, is arraigned as unrea&s;onable, and his So|vereignty is, in the mo&s;t &s;aucy Manner oppo&s;ed: The Fall of Man is intirely forgot, and his ori|ginal Corruption is eagerly denied: The Satis|faction of Chri&s;t is bla&s;phemed and exploded, and his Death is &s;aid to be what mu&s;t, accord|ing to the nece&s;&s;ity of Nature, have fallen out: Ju&s;tification by his Righteou&s;ne&s;s, is a Point pur|sued with Rancour and Malice; and Sincerity, tho' in an Error, is given out to be a &s;ufficient Title to God's Favour: Preaching Chri&s;t in his Per&s;on, Offices, and in the Merit of his Death, undergoes the Per&s;ecution of cruel Mockings, and is &s;poken of by brain-&s;ick Novices only with a Snear: The efficacious Grace of the Holy Spi|rit, and his &s;anctifying and comforting Influen|ces, are rudely bla&s;phemed as Enthu&s;ia&s;m; and the Power of Man to convert him&s;elf, and to an&s;wer all the Ends of his living in the World, is eagerly contended for: &mdash; The Per&s;everance of the Saints in Holine&s;s, is profanely bantered: The &s;tupid and bruti&s;h Notion of the Soul's &s;leep|ing after Death, is by &s;ome hotly maintained, and its Immateriality &amp; Immortality exploded by o|thers.

<P>And is this the doleful State of Religion, as to Matters of Belief among Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters at Home? Then let us look to it, that it be not our Condition here. The &s;ame <HI>reverend Per&s;on</HI> tells us, that Matters are not better with them with re&s;pect to Practice, than they are with re&s;pect to Faith. And if we with them, let go the Principles of Re|ligion, with them al&s;o, &s;hall we forego the Practice of it. If we grow as corrupt in our Doctrines as they; we &s;hall grow as corrupt in our Lives and Conver&s;ations. If we make Shipwreck of Faith, &s;o we &s;hall of a good Con&s;cience. Let us then, be up|on our Guard: Let us heedfully watch again&s;t all Temptations of one kind and of another, to draw us off from the Truth.</P>
<P>And let us e&s;pecially &s;ee to this, that our Know|lege of divine Truths, be &s;piritual and &s;aving. A literal and doctrinal Knowlege of divine Truths, is no Security again&s;t Apo&s;tacy from them. He that only has the Truths of the Go&s;pel floating on the &s;urface of his Brains, may hold 'em to Day, and renounce them toMorrow. But a &s;aving Know|lege of Go&s;pel-Truths, is a good &s;ecurity again&s;t Temptations, oppo&s;ition or &s;eduction from the Truth. Prov. xxiv.5. <HI>A wi&s;e Man is &s;trong, yea, a Man of Knowledge increa&s;eth Strength.</HI> When Men come to &s;ee the Truths of the Go&s;pel, in their &s;piritual Na|ture and Glory; when they are convinced of the

<P N="2">2. As to the <HI>Wor&s;hip of God.</HI></P>
<P N="1">(1.) <HI>Let it be our great concern to pre&s;erve and maintain it, in it's Purity.</HI> Let us look upon the Word of God, as a perfect Rule of Wor&s;hip, as well as of Faith; and keep &s;everely to it, in this matter. Admitting nothing, that is contradicted by it, nor detracting any Thing, that is pre&s;cribed therein. Man may vainly think, to make God's Ordinances better, by &s;ome Additions &amp; Inventions of his own: But let us believe, that's it's better for us, to enjoy them in their native Purity, Simplicity, and Spiri|tuality. A pompous ceremonial Wor&s;hip it's true, is more apt to work upon, and affect the Sen&s;es; but a pure, &s;piritual and divine Wor&s;hip, &s;uch as Go&s;pel Wor&s;hip is, is more adapted to reach the Soul. And then due Care &s;hould be taken by the&s;e Churches, that there Members be, as the Members of the fir&s;t Churches of the Go&s;pel were, even, <HI>Saints, faithful Brethren, &amp; &s;anctified in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI> <Q>Such as are found and knowing in all the funda|mental Doctrines of the chri&s;tian Religion, with|out Scandal in their Lives, and to a Judgment regulated by the Word of God, are Per&s;ons of vi&s;ible Godline&s;s &amp; Hone&s;ty, credibly profe&s;&s;ing cordial Subjection to Chri&s;t.</Q> Since God is jea|lous of his Wor&s;hip, &s;o let us be.</P>

This is a Duty which our Lord recommends unto us by his own Example, as well as &s;trictly requires of us. Morning and Even|ing did he engage in it. Let us imitate our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour herein, and make a practice of &s;ecret Prayer to God Morning and Evening, as long as we live. With what Face can we call our &s;elves Chri&s;tians, if we neglect it?</P>
<P><HI>Family-Wor&s;hip,</HI> Let that al&s;o be duly perform'd. Families are furni&s;hed with many &s;pecial Advanta|ges and Opportunities for God's &s;olemn Wor&s;hip, which are &s;o many Talents, that they ought to im|prove for God, and in the wor&s;hipping of him. God is the Founder and In&s;titutor of our Families: and &s;ince they are of him, and thro' him, they ought to be to him. Our Families are the Lord's, for he made them; therefore &s;hould they be for his U&s;e, imployed in his Service, to his Honour.</P>
<P>And here, <HI>Let us pray to God in our Families.</HI> Heads of Families &s;hould pray with them and for them. We are bidden to <HI>pray with all Prayer,</HI> Eph. 6.18. with Family-Prayer, as well as &s;ecret and publick. We are taught it, by the Example of holy Man in Scripture. <HI>Abraham</HI> with his Hou&s;hold called on the Name of the Lord. Where-ever he pitched his Tent, there he built an Altar to the Lord. <HI>Gen.</HI> xii.8, &mdash; xiii.4, 18. <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> &s;aid, <HI>As for me and my Hou&s;e, we will &s;erve the Lord.</HI> Prayer is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary a part of God's Service, that a Per|&s;on can't be &s;aid in general to be devoted to God's Service without it. And of <HI>Cornelius</HI> it is &s;aid, <HI>Act.</HI> x.2. That <HI>he feared God with all his Hou&s;e&mdash;and pray|ed alway.</HI> He wor&s;hipped God with all his Hou&s;e, and maintained a con&s;tant cour&s;e of Prayer with them. The Jews were won't to Sacrifice to God, every Morning and Evening, <HI>Numb.</HI> xxviii.3, 4.

Chri&s;tians that by Profe&s;&s;ion are a Royal Prie&s;thood, &s;hould offer the Sacrifice of Family Prayer &amp; Prai&s;e, every Morning and Evening. When the Apo&s;tle &s;ays to Ma&s;ters of Families, Col. 4.2. <HI>Continue in Prayer</HI>; it's probable (&s;ays One) he alludes to the continual Burnt-Offering, that was offered Morning and Evening. O how rea&s;onable, how becoming is it, for Families in the Morning, to ble&s;s God for the Mercies of the Night pa&s;t, and to ask his need|ful Favours for the en&s;uing Day. And &s;o in the Evening, to ble&s;s God for the Mercies of the Day pa&s;t, and to ask his Protection &amp; Favour to them, in the en&s;uing Night. And what Rea&s;on have tho&s;e Families, that neglect calling upon God, to fear, that he will <HI>pour out his Fury on them?</HI></P>
<P>Further, We &s;hould teach our Families <HI>the good Knowlege of the Lord.</HI> Deut. xi.18, 19, 20. <HI>There|fore &s;hall ye lay up the&s;e my Words in your Heart, and in your Soul; and bind them for a Sign upon your Hand, that they may be as Frontlets between your Eyes. And ye &s;hall teach them your Children, &s;peaking of them when thou &s;itte&s;t in thine Hou&s;e, and when thou walk|e&s;t by the Way, when thou lie&s;t down, and when thou ri&s;e&s;t up. And thou &s;halt write them upon the Door|Po&s;ts of thine Hou&s;e, and upon thy Gates.</HI> Eph. vi.4. <HI>And ye Fathers, bring up your Children in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord.</HI> Parents &amp; Heads of Fa|milies, &s;hould read the Scriptures to their Families, in a &s;erious and &s;olemn Manner. And they &s;hould Catechi&s;e their Children and Servants, obliging them to learn their Catechi&s;m by Heart, and to keep it in remembrance: And &s;hould endeavour to help them to under&s;tand it, as they become capable. Both Parents would do well to engage in a dili|gent In&s;tructing their Children. <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Father was his Tutor, <HI>Prov.</HI> iv.3, 4.

And let us be advi&s;ed <HI>to come &s;ea&s;onably.</HI> Many wrong their own Souls in not &s;o doing.

<P><HI>Honourable Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>You have a &s;pecial Opportunity before you to further the religious, as well as civil Intere&s;ts of this People. May God direct and a&s;&s;i&s;t you aright to improve it. Let not &s;o much as one of you, give up him&s;elf to the Conduct of others, to do what they would have you, without examining whether it be right or wrong. U&s;e your own Light &amp; Rea|son, which God has given you, in this weighty Affair. It is a mean Thing indeed, to &s;erve only as Tools, for others to work by. Will you remem|ber, Sirs, that your Suffrages are not your own. You may not give your Voices to the&s;e and tho&s;e, as you plea&s;e. Con&s;ider, when you are together, that God &s;tandeth in the Congregation of the Mighty; he judgeth among the Gods. And if any of you a|bu&s;e your Power in chu&s;ing, which God by the Royal CHARTER has conferred upon you, you mu&s;t account for it another Day. Let all crooked De|&s;igns and &s;ini&s;ter Ends be now laid a&s;ide; and act in the Integrity of your Hearts, as in the Pre&s;ence of God, and under his impartial Eye; and be &s;ure that you chu&s;e for him. Be not by a&s;&s;ed by Preju|dice, Partiality, Di&s;affection, or per&s;onal Favour in

your Choice: But let the known Worth and Fitne&s;&s; of Per&s;ons determine you. Such as have a Seat in his Maje&s;ty's Council, have a very great and weigh|ty Tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them; and &s;uperior Powers are needful rightly to di&s;charge it. Such had need to be Men of exce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ing di&s;tingui&s;hing Knowlege and Wi&s;dom; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> your Choice you mu&s;t have re|&s;pect to the&s;e Qualifications: but the&s;e are not all that are nece&s;&s;ary; in de&s;igning Men to this high Station, principal Regard mu&s;t be had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Religion, that they be Men of &s;incere Piety: And if Per&s;ons are void of this, how eminent &s;oever they may be, for their other Accompli&s;hments, yet by all Means let them be rejected. Among other Things, which the Council is betru&s;ted withal, it mu&s;t be remem|bred, that they are an eminent Branch of the Le|gi&s;lature, and &s;o bear a &s;pecial Part in framing our Laws: They al&s;o with the Governour, Con&s;titute our Judges and Ju&s;tices; and the Over&s;ight of the College, is in Part committed to them. Chu&s;e Men then, that having Religion near their Hearts, mourn our Degeneracies, tremble for the Ark of God, and will addre&s;s them&s;elves with unfainting Appli|cation, for the reviving Religion among us, the re|gaining and &s;ecuring the gracious Pre&s;ence of God with us. Particularly, Tho&s;e that will be ready to bring forward &s;uch whol&s;ome Laws, as are nece&s;&s;ary and u&s;eful to advance Religion; and concern'd to appoint &s;uitable Per&s;ons to Execute &s;uch Laws; and will take Care of the College, that it an&s;wer the End which our mo&s;t excellent Predece&s;&s;ors and renowned Fore-Fathers had in founding it.</P>
<P>And now, with a thankful Acknowlegement of the many good and excellent Laws, which former A&s;&s;emblies have Enacted to promote Religion a|mong us; I would humbly reque&s;t of this honour|able
<PB N="50" REF="004153_0053_1003D910AEB51B88">
Great and General A&s;&s;embly here pre&s;ent, to take Religion into their &s;erious Con&s;ideration, and in their Wi&s;dom meditate, whether &s;ome other Laws may not be made, that will befriend the Intere&s;t of it? It is our Life, the one Thing needful; it is our all. You cannot (my Fathers) employ your &s;elves about a bigger, or better Thing.</P>
<P>Will you allow me here to &s;ugge&s;t one or two Things.</P>
<P>It is to be feared that Per&s;ons negligence in at|tending the publick Wor&s;hip of the Sanctuary, is daily growing upon us; can nothing further be done for the Remedy of it?</P>
<P>And does not the Sin of Drunkenne&s;s dreadfully increa&s;e among us? Bringing with it, Woes, Mi|&s;eries and Mi&s;chiefs of all Sorts. May not &s;ome|thing more be done to &s;uppre&s;s &s;o great an Evil? The licen&s;ing of unqualified Per&s;ons, to be Inn|holders and Retailers; and the multiplying Hou&s;es to &s;ell &s;trong Drink, may ju&s;tly be thought to be the great Cau&s;es of this deluge of Debauchery, that is flowing in upon us. If Per&s;ons who have little or no Con&s;cience, come to be Innholders or Retailers, they will allow of vile Di&s;orders; and will not care how much they corrupt their Neighbours, if they can gain by it them&s;elves. Such Hou&s;es will prove the Nur&s;eries of Vice, Di&s;order &amp; Irreligion. And the needle&s;s multiplying of Taverns, &amp; other Hou&s;es of publick Licence among a People, is of pernicious Con&s;equence unto them. What are they up and down in a Town, but &s;o many Traps and Snares to catch and de&s;troy the lovers of &s;trong Drink. They are Temptations to &s;uch, and the more there are of them, and the nearer they are to
<PB N="51" REF="004153_0054_1003D915A86F0F18">
them, the more likelihood there is of their being undone by them. Can nothing now be done by the Legi&s;lature, for the removal of the&s;e Nu&s;ances? We ask of our honourable Rulers the&s;e two Things; The one is, that no Per&s;on be allowed to &s;ell &s;trong Drink, but what are of approved Sobriety, and good Conver&s;ation, Men of Hone&s;ty and good Or|der. The other is, that Hou&s;es for this Purpo&s;e, be not needle&s;ly multiplied.</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible, that there is a Law, which prohi|bits any to be Licen&s;ed to &s;ell &s;trong Drink, but &s;uch as are approbated by the Select-Men of a Town. But then it is not enjoyned upon &s;uch as are ve&s;ted with Power of granting Licences, that all &s;uch &s;hall be Licen&s;ed. And it is to be hoped, that tho&s;e that are immediately concerned in that Affair, will not look upon &s;uch an Approbation, as a &s;afe Rule, al|ways to be relied upon, and to go by.</P>
<P>There is one Thing more which I would recom|mend to the &s;erious Con&s;ideration of this Great and General Court; and that is, Whether there is not a great Duty lying upon us, re&s;pecting the Tran&s;|actions of the Year 1692, when not only many Per&s;ons were taken off by the Hand of publick Ju&s;tice for the &s;uppo&s;ed Crime of Witchcraft; but their E&s;tates al&s;o ruined, and their Families impo|verished. None di&s;pute the Integrity of tho&s;e, who were then concerned to act and judge mo&s;t in tho&s;e Matters. But it was a dark Day with them; they walk'd in the Clouds, and could not clearly &s;ee their way, as to the My&s;tery of Iniquity then working. All Orders of Per&s;ons have &s;ince &s;een Rea&s;on to condemn the Rules of the whole Proce&s;s as fallaci|ous and in&s;ufficient to di&s;tingui&s;h the Guilty from

the Innocent<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See the Rev. Mr. <HI>Hale's</HI> accurate and judicious Di&s;cour&s;e concerning Witchcraft, &s;hewing how Per&s;ons guilty of that Crime may be convicted; and in which the Means u&s;ed for their di&s;covery are di&s;cu&s;&s;ed both negatively and affirmative|ly, according to Scripture and Experience.</NOTE>. What the Sen&s;e even of our Pre|dece&s;&s;ors, and tho&s;e who were then upon the Stage of Action was, in relation to this Affair, may be in &s;ome mea&s;ure learned from a Proclamation for a General Fa&s;t, emitted <HI>Decemb.</HI> 17. 1696, four Years after; in which is contained this Direction for pub|lick Prayers, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>That God would &s;hew us what we know not, and help us wherein we have done ami&s;s, to do &s;o no more: And e&s;pecially that whatever Mi&s;takes on either Hand, have been fallen into, either by the body of this People, or any order of Men, referring to the late Tragedy rai&s;ed by Satan and his In&s;truments, thro' the awful Judgments of God: He would humble us therefor, and pardon all the Errors of his Ser|vants and People, that de&s;ire to love his Name; and be atoned to his Land.</Q></P>
<P>Now tho' the lo&s;s of Parents cannot be made up to their &s;urviving Po&s;terity, yet their E&s;tates may: And the Que&s;tion is (if it be not beyond all Que&s;tion) whether a Re&s;titution is not due from the Publick to them, and we are not bound in Ju&s;tice to make it. Hereby Infamy may be taken off from the Names and Memory of &s;uch as were Executed, and who it may be did not in the lea&s;t de&s;erve it; as well as a Reparation made to their Children for the Injuries done them; who remain to this Day among us in mean, low and abject Circum&s;tances. It is now &s;omething more than forty Years &s;ince the&s;e &s;ad Things were done among us; but length of Time is no Argument that God is not at

this Day, among other Things, contending with us for the&s;e; &s;ince he puni&s;hed <HI>I&s;rael</HI> with Famine three Years for a Sin of mi&s;guided Zeal committed forty Years before that, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> xxi.1, 2.</P>
<P>I am &s;peaking of the Ways whereby our civil Rulers may promote the Intere&s;t of Religion among us. And I now proceed to &s;ay, that another Way, is, by putting the Execution of the Laws made for this Purpo&s;e, into the Hands of well-accompli&s;hed, and well-qualified Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>Will his EXCELLENCY then, and the HO|NOURABLE BOARD, &s;uffer me to intreat them, care|fully to heed this. Appoint none to this momen|tous Bu&s;ine&s;s, but &s;uch as are Men of Knowlege, and well acquainted with the Laws; Men of Re|ligion, that will lay out them&s;elves with Courage and Zeal to execute them. To de&s;ign Men to take Care of the Intere&s;t of Religion, that have none them&s;elves; how incongruous would this be? And what could we expect from &s;uch? Will they in good earne&s;t &s;eek the advancement of what they hate? With what Face and Courage can they ex|ecute the good Laws upon Offenders, who live in the violation of them them&s;elves? Will they di&s;|countenance Sin &amp; Vice among a People, who are daily encouraging it by their Practice? Such mu&s;t be good Men, as well as knowing Men; otherwi&s;e they will be like to de&s;troy more good, than they will do.</P>
<P>And now, I would with &s;uitable Deference ap|ply my &s;elf, to our honourable Judges and Ju&s;tices. And what is now reque&s;ted of you, is, the vigo|rous, faithful, impartial Execution of all tho&s;e whole&s;ome and good Laws, which are made, or may be made, for the encouraging of Piety and
<PB N="54" REF="004153_0057_1003D943BA66B2E8">
Virtue, and the di&s;couraging of Vice and Wicked|ne&s;s. <HI>Take heed</HI> (Sirs) <HI>what ye do: for ye judge not for Men, but for the Lord, who is with you in the Judgment. Wherefore now, let the fear of the Lord be upon you; take heed and do it: for there is no In|iquity with the Lord our God, nor re&s;pect of Per&s;ons, nor taking of Gifts,</HI> 2 Chron. xix.6, 7.</P>
<P>And it is greatly to be wi&s;hed for, that Under|Officers, <HI>Grand Jurors</HI> and <HI>Tything-Men</HI> e&s;pecially, would remember the Oath of God, which they are put under; and be quickned thereby faithfully to di&s;charge what they are &s;o &s;olemnly obliged unto. And may &s;uch as are faithful, have all po&s;&s;ible En|couragement given them, in the way of their Duty.</P>
<P>I go on to &s;ay, It greatly &s;erves the Intere&s;t of Religion in our Churches, when they are &s;upplied with a learned, orthodox and godly Mini&s;try; and this is the Province of our civil Rulers. 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> xvii.8, 9. And they &s;hould encourage the Hearts, and &s;trengthen the Hands of the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, in the regular di&s;charge of their Office. Their faithfulne&s;s may &s;ometimes expo&s;e them, to the rage and fury of unrea&s;onable and wicked Men: You, who <HI>are the Shields of our Earth,</HI> &s;hould guard them again&s;t their In&s;ults. With good <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> you &s;hould <HI>&s;peak comfortably to them.</HI> And like him, and that excellent Governour, <HI>Nehemiah</HI>; take care, that they be &s;upported; that being freed from the Cares and Incumbrances of the World, they may give them&s;elves wholly to their Work.</P>
<P>And now, let me recommend unto our civil Ru|lers, the good Education of the <HI>Children</HI> and <HI>Youth</HI> among this People. Let not the Laws made, for the &s;upport of le&s;&s;er Schools thro' the Land, be &s;ham'd and eluded, as too often they have &s;hamefully been.
<PB N="55" REF="004153_0058_1003D91EEA482090">
And let the great School of the Prophets, be ten|derly cheri&s;hed, maintained, and carefully in&s;pect|ed by you. Take care, that the College be a Se|minary of pure and undefiled Religion, as well as good Literature.</P>
<P>We would mourn this Day the Death of the late reverend and honoured Pre&s;ident of that Society<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Benjamin Wad&s;worth.</HI></NOTE>, and our great Lo&s;s therein; for he was a faithful Man, and feared God above many. May God, with whom is the re&s;idue of the Spirit, fill up that vacan|cy with One that &s;hall be a rich Ble&s;&s;ing to the Col|lege, and to the whole Land. May tho&s;e, who are more immediately concerned, in fixing a Pre&s;ident there, be directed to chu&s;e One that is of eminent Learning and Wi&s;dom, of found Principles, a fa&s;t Friend to the&s;e Churches, endow'd with a Spirit of Government; and to crown every Thing el&s;e, one of &s;hining Piety; who will make it his Bu&s;ine&s;s, to promote vital Religion, as well as Learning, among our Youth: exhorting and comforting and charg|ing every one of them as a Father doth his Chil|dren. This is the way to have a converted Mini|&s;try, without which we mu&s;t not expect a convert|ing Mini&s;try.</P>
<P>Our religious Intere&s;ts have a great dependance upon the College. If that Fountain be kept pure, the <HI>Streams thereof will make glad the City of God</HI>; but if corrupted, the Churches will &s;oon be infect|ed. So it far'd with the <HI>Belgick Churches,</HI> when one of their illu&s;trious Schools, became &s;uch a troubled Fountain.</P>
<P>Permit me (Honourable Rulers) to mention one Thing more, which may greatly conduce to the ad|vancement of Religion among us, and that is, your
<PB N="56" REF="004153_0059_1003B6F7D04AFD70">
&s;etting good Examples before us. Examples are very influencial, e&s;pecially the Examples of Rulers are &s;o. This is evident from the Carriage of God's People of old, who commonly walked with, or con|trary to God, as their Kings, were good or bad. If then you would have your People behave &s;ober|ly, righteou&s;ly and godly; &s;ee to it, that you lead &s;ober, righteous, and godly Lives your &s;elves.</P>
<P>So have I put our civil Fathers in remembrance of &s;everal Ways, that are to be taken by them, for our Reformation. Will you now be plea&s;ed to a|ri&s;e to the Work, with an unwearied Application. God, we hope, will &s;ucceed and pro&s;per your &s;in|cere and pious Endeavours. However this be, they will find acceptance with God thro' Chri&s;t; you will enjoy the Satisfaction and Plea&s;ure of having done your Duty; and &s;hall not mi&s;s of the Reward of good and faithful Servants in the heavenly World.</P>
<P>I come now,</P>

And let me be&s;eech you to u&s;e your con&s;tant, painful, and faithful Endeavours to promote the Intere&s;t of Religion among us. Our recovery from that Apo&s;tacy, that we are fallen in|to, as to outward Means, does principally depend upon &s;uch your Endeavours; and they are no more than what God and Man expect from you, and you are &s;olemnly obliged to.</P>
<P><HI>Reverend and much E&s;teemed:</HI> Allow me here, mean and unworthy as I am, to put you in mind of a few Things, the ob&s;ervance of which, may greatly contribute to the advancement of the King|dom and Intere&s;t of Chri&s;t among us.</P>
<P>And in the fir&s;t Place, I humbly propo&s;e, that as the Apo&s;tle Paul among his <HI>Corinthians,</HI> &s;o we a|mong our people, <HI>determine to know nothing, but
<PB N="57" REF="004153_0060_1003D94561DDE818">Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and him crucified.</HI> Let Chri&s;t be the principal Subject of our Preaching. Let us lift him up on high in our Congregations, and di&s;play his Glory before our People. The glory of his Divi|nity, the glory of his Humanity, and the glory of the Con&s;titution of the Per&s;on of Chri&s;t, who is both God and Man in one Per&s;on. Let us preach of the Offices of Chri&s;t, of his precious Benefits, of the indearing Relations he &s;tands in to his People's and of his mo&s;t excellent Example. Is Chri&s;t the very Marrow, Soul and Scope of the holy Scrip|tures? Then &s;uch Sermons, as have much of Chri&s;t in them, come neare&s;t to tho&s;e &s;acred Records, and we may conclude are mo&s;t likely to do good. It is ju&s;tly to be feared (Sirs) that one great Cau&s;e of the woful decay of vital Piety in the chri&s;tian Church, is the neglect which has been in preaching Chri&s;t. Let us hear what the excellent Dr. <HI>Watts</HI> &s;ays, <Q>Let us Mini&s;ters con&s;ider how little has been our <HI>Succe&s;s,</HI> in compari&s;on of the Multitudes converted by our Fathers, in the Day of their Mini&s;try. Now it is worth our In|quiry, Whether it may not be a&s;cribed unto the <HI>Ab&s;ence of Chri&s;t</HI> in our Sermons. And what Rea&s;on indeed can we have, to expect the Pre|&s;ence and Influence of the Spirit of Chri&s;t, if we leave his Per&s;on, his Offices, his Grace, and his Go&s;pel, out of our Di&s;cour&s;es; or give but a &s;light and ca&s;ual Hint at tho&s;e glorious Subjects, which ought to be our daily Theme!</Q> Ble&s;&s;ed be God, we have had Fathers, who have been e|minent for their preaching of Chri&s;t. And it is Matter of Thankfulne&s;s, that we yet have Fathers among us, who account, <Q>Chri&s;t the favourite Subject in the Cour&s;e of their Studies for the Pulpit</Q>. Let us, my Brethren, by all Means copy after them.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="004153_0061_1003D9224DC786E0">I go on to &s;ay, that the Truths of the Go&s;pel, particularly, the important Doctrines of Grace, are a mo&s;t precious Trea&s;ure committed to our Cu&s;tody. <HI>O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy Tru&s;t.</HI> But how &s;hould we keep them?

<P>Now when I &s;ay, that the&s;e great Truths of the Go&s;pel &s;hould be preach'd; none will under&s;tand &s;o, as if I thought the preaching of chri&s;tian and evangelical Duties were a needle&s;s Thing; no, we mu&s;t <HI>not &s;hun to declare the whole Coun&s;el of God,</HI> but mu&s;t preach the before mentioned Truths, as the Foundation of practical Religion, &amp; without which the Life and Power of Godline&s;s is not like to be maintained!

<P>To &s;ay, It may very much promote the Intere&s;t of Religion among us, to in&s;i&s;t upon the great Doc|trine of Conver&s;ion; making that one grand Sub|ject of our preaching.

Let us pre&s;s the Nece&s;&s;ity of it. And &s;ince the Law is our School-ma&s;ter to bring us to Chri&s;t, let us in the mo&s;t clear and affecting Man|ner we can, represent to Sinners the dreadful Mi|&s;eries of Hell, that they are expo&s;ed unto, and are in daily Danger of. Though our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, was anointed to preach the Go&s;pel to the Poor; yet how frequently do we find him preaching up the Doctrine of Hell-torments to the Impenitent and Secure? It is needful that in this Way, &s;leepy Sin|ners &s;hould be awakened; this is &s;ome Preparation to a &s;ound Conver&s;ion. And &s;ince the Heart is &s;o very deceitful, and Men are &s;o apt to think them|&s;elves rich, &amp; increa&s;ed with Goods, and have need of nothing; when they are wretched, and mi&s;e|rable, and poor, and blind, and naked; it &s;eems very nece&s;&s;ary, that in our preaching, we labour to di&s;cover what tho&s;e Grounds, Rea&s;onings or Pretences are, upon which Men build their Confi|dence, and &s;hew the Rottenne&s;s &amp; Fallacy of 'em.

<P>And then, let us take Time for, and Pains in compo&s;ing our Sermons: And when we have made them, let us labour to get our own &s;inful Hearts in|to a due and &s;olemn Frame to deliver them. It is a known Saying of the famous Mr. <HI>Shepard</HI> of <HI>Cam|bridge,</HI> and it de&s;erves to be written in Letters of Gold upon our Study-Doors: <Q>God will cur&s;e that Man's Labours, that lumbers up and down in the World all the Week, and then upon Saturday in the Afternoon, goes to his Study: whenas God knows, that Time were little enough to pray in, and weep in, and get his Heart into a fit Frame for the Duties of the approaching Sabbath <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his Life, in Dr. <HI>Mather</HI>'s Hi&s;tory of <HI>New England.</HI> Book 3 p. 90</NOTE></Q>. O let us take Pains in our Preparations for the Pul|pit! Let them &s;mell of the Lamp; let them be beaten Oil for the Sanctuary; having in the fir&s;t place, &s;ought to God to direct and a&s;&s;i&s;t us therein. And then, let us beg of God, that the holy Truths which we have got to deliver to others, may fir&s;t be impre&s;s'd on our own Hearts, that we may &s;peak of them in a very lively manner. Very much de|pends upon this: for it is the Mind that convinces the Mind; and the Heart, that per&s;wades the Heart.</P>

To expre&s;s his Humility, his Meekne&s;s, Self-Denial, readine&s;s for the Cro&s;s, contempt of the World, heavenly Mindedne&s;s, Benignity, Conde&s;cen&s;ion, Patience, &amp;c. Such a Life as this, tends greatly to the Succe&s;s of our Mini&s;try. It commands Re&s;|pect and Reverence from our People, and our Preaching will come with more Authority, Force and Energy, and &s;ink deeper into their Souls. When we exemplify the holy Doctrine, which we Preach in our Actions, and live the Sermons which we deliver to others, this has a &s;ilent power of At|traction in it, to draw Men to their Duty. Be&s;ides God will honour &s;uch as thus honour him, 1 Sam. ii.30. And will delight to &s;ucceed their Labours.&mdash; <HI>He walked with me in Peace and Equity, and did turn many away from Iniquity,</HI> Mal. ii.6. On the other Hand, when a Mini&s;ter in the Cour&s;e of his Life, holds forth the Bea&s;t, or the Devil; I mean the Lu&s;ts of the Fle&s;h, or the Lu&s;ts of the Spirit; he becomes contemptible, and de&s;ervedly &s;o, Mat. v.I3. And if once his Per&s;on is contemned, &s;o will his Preaching be; and Men will not regard what he &s;ays. How much then does it concern us, that in all Things, we &s;hew our &s;elves Patterns of good Works. Tit. ii.7.

When I &s;ay unto the Wicked, thou &s;halt &s;urely die; and thou give&s;t him not Warning, nor &s;peake&s;t to warn the Wicked from his Way to &s;ave his Life; the &s;ame wicked Man &s;hall die in his Iniquity;

but his Blood will I require at thine Hand.</HI> Let us be &s;ollicitous to under&s;tand our Duty; and when we know it, let us be bold and daring to do it.

And when this is done, let us &s;elect &s;ome of the weigh|tie&s;t Points, and apply them to their tender Souls in a warm Addre&s;s: This is the Life of all, and may prove a Means of their early and &s;aving Con|ver&s;ion to God.</P>
<P>Abundance of Good may be done among our People, by vi&s;iting of them; and entertaining them,
<PB N="65" REF="004153_0068_1003D936E9BA5B98">
with our pious Di&s;cour&s;e; &s;uiting them with agre|able Addre&s;&s;es; in&s;tructing, exhorting, reproving, coun&s;elling, and comforting them, as there is Oc|ca&s;ion. And perhaps, we may receive, as well as do a great deal by &s;uch Vi&s;its. Rom. xv.24. The Apo&s;tle &s;peaking there to the believing <HI>Romans,</HI> &s;ays, <HI>When&s;oever I &s;hall take my Journey into Spain, I will come unto you: for I tru&s;t to &s;ee you in my Jour|ney, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if fir&s;t I be &s;omewhat filled with your Company.</HI> The Communion of Saints is filling, not empty, vain and frothy, as the Company of mo&s;t is; but admi|ni&s;tring Grace and Comfort to tho&s;e that enjoy it. Let us then, as our more weighty Duties will allow attend this part of Duty al&s;o.</P>
<P>Before I pa&s;s from this Head of Vi&s;iting, allow me to &s;ay, we &s;hould as we have Opportunity there|for, make our friendly Vi&s;its to each other. In &s;uch Vi&s;its, Men of your high Station and Character, will di&s;dain a low, grovelling, in&s;ipid, trifling Con|ver&s;ation. Your Conver&s;ation with each other, will be polite and learned; by all Means let it be re|ligious too. 'Tis &s;aid of tho&s;e two excellent Mi|ni&s;ters of Chri&s;t, Bi&s;hop <HI>U&s;her,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Pre&s;ton,</HI> That after much Di&s;cour&s;e of Learning and other Matters had between them, the Bi&s;hop would &s;ay, "Come Doctor, One Word of CHRIST now before" we part. Beautiful! charming Example! But I'll go higher than this. We read of the Seraphims, I&s;ai. 6.3. <HI>That one cried unto another, and &s;aid, Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord of Ho&s;ts, the whole Earth is full of his Glory.</HI> They cried one to another, and &s;aid; as if they would by their holy, and heavenly Language, inflame each other's Brea&s;ts. Let now the Angels of the Churches, go and do likewi&s;e.</P>
<P>If after all, we meet with Sufferings from tho&s;e, to whom for Chri&s;t's Sake, we have (thro' Grace)
<PB N="66" REF="004153_0069_1003D94C4AECF770">
been faithful Servants; with ba&s;e and unworthy Treatment from tho&s;e, for who&s;e good, we have &s;pent our Lives and Strength, let us not be &s;urpri|&s;ed at it. It is a Temptation, but common to the be&s;t of Mini&s;ters. It is to try our Patience! O for the Go&s;pel Sake, that that be not hindred, let it have it's perfect Work in us. Let us now, <HI>not be overcome of Evil, but overcome Evil with Good.</HI> In &s;uch a Ca&s;e as this, let us hearken to the good Ad|vice, which the venerable old Mr. <HI>Eliot,</HI> was wont to give his Brethren, when complaining to him, that &s;uch and &s;uch in their Flocks were too difficult for them. <Q>Brother, (&s;ays he) Compa&s;s them! And, Brother, Learn the Meaning of tho&s;e three little Words, <HI>Bear, forbear, forgive.</HI></Q> Brethren! Let none of the&s;e Things move us, neither let us <HI>count our Lives dear unto us, &s;o that we may fini&s;h our Cour&s;e with Joy, and the Mini&s;try which we have received of the Lord Je&s;us, to te&s;tify the Go&s;pel of the Grace of God.</HI> Let us &s;oar above 'em. Let us live above 'em, even in Heaven, and then we &s;hall bet|ter bear the Hard&s;hips, which we may meet withal here upon Earth. Are our Labours of Love, ill-rewarded by Men? Let us be <HI>&s;tedfa&s;t, unmoveable, always abounding in the Work of the Lord; for as much as we know that our Labour is not in vain in the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>There is one Thing more, which I can't well pa&s;s over; &s;uffer me to offer that, and I &s;hall have done. It is, that we be very careful to maintain Peace and Unity among our&s;elves; and not &s;uffer different Sentiments in &s;maller Matters to divide us, and drive us into Parties. You are very &s;en&s;i|ble (Rev. Sirs,) that as the Truths of our holy Religion, are not all equally great and nece&s;&s;ary; for neither are they all alike clearly revealed. Some Truths compared with others are le&s;&s;er, more darkly
<PB N="67" REF="004153_0070_1003B6EF204AD0B0">
revealed, and far le&s;s di&s;cernable. Hence it can|not be expected, but that we &s;hall have different Apprehen&s;ions about 'em; tho' at the &s;ame time, we may be well agreed, in the more weighty Mat|ters of the Go&s;pel. What &s;hall we do in this Ca&s;e? Different Apprehen&s;ions in many Matters of Reli|gion, we &s;hall have while here in this World; &s;o many, &s;o various, are the Cau&s;es of 'em, that it is impo&s;&s;ible it &s;hould be otherwi&s;e with us. Unity of the Faith is not to be expected, till we get to Hea|ven; or the new Jeru&s;alem comes down from God out of Heaven. Shall we grow cold in our Regards and Affections to one another? Shall we grow an|gry with one another, becau&s;e of the&s;e unavoidable different Sentiments? By no Means. But let us be kindly affectioned one to another with brother|ly Love, in Honour preferring one another, not|with&s;tanding. Let us not &s;pend any of our Time in wrangling &amp; bitter Di&s;putes, about the&s;e lower, dark and doubtful Matters: Let us not &s;pend too much of our &s;hort Time in any kind of Di&s;putes a|bout them; but keeping them in their due Subordi|nation, let us with one Heart and Hand, with one Shoulder and Con&s;ent, lay out our &s;elves in pro|moting the common Intere&s;t of Chri&s;t's Kingdom, and the common Salvation of precious and immor|tal Souls. By all Means, let us e&s;pou&s;e generous Principles; let us breathe a catholick Spirit; let us be one with every one, that is one with Je&s;us Chri&s;t; whether they be Lutherans, or Calvini&s;ts, Epi&s;co|palians, or Presbyterians, Congregationali&s;ts, or An|tipoedobapti&s;ts; or whatever other Denomination they may be of. I have met with a Pa&s;&s;age of the very excellent Mr. <HI>Matthew Henry,</HI> which &s;eems worthy of a Remark, with which I &s;hall clo&s;e this Head. <Q>The Differences (&s;ays he) that are among Chri&s;tians, tho' fomented by the Malice
<PB N="68" REF="004153_0071_1003B6FF78C60EC0">
of Satan for the Ruin of Love, are permitted by the Wi&s;dom of God for the Tryal of Love, that <HI>they which are perfect</HI> therein <HI>may be manife&s;t.</HI> Herein a Chri&s;tian commendeth his Love, when he loves tho&s;e who differ from him, and joins in Affection to tho&s;e with whom he cannot concur in Opinion.</Q></P>
<P>Thus I have pre&s;um'd to addre&s;s the Fathers of the Country, civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical; and having &s;poken to 'em &s;eparately, what if I &s;hould now join them together? May they ever be &s;o in their E&s;teem of Love and Affection to each other. So <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Aaron</HI> met in the Mount of God, and ki&s;&s;ed each other. And it might very much conduce to the Advancement of Religion among us, if the&s;e two Orders of Men would join their Coun&s;els, &amp; unite in their Con&s;ultations about the Ways &amp; Methods in which to pur&s;ue it.</P>
<P>But it is high Time for me to come to a Conclu&s;ion. If then we were con&s;tant &amp; fervent in our Prayers and Supplications for the Effu&s;ions of the Holy Spirit upon us; and were our Prayers accompanied with our &s;incere &amp; vigorous Endeavours to carry on a Work of Reformation? Did we in the &s;everal Places in which God hath &s;et us, whether private or publick, lay out our&s;elves to promote the Intere&s;t of dying Re|ligion among us; we might then hope, that we &s;hould not be termed, for&s;aken &amp; de&s;olate; nor made to &s;igh out our Ichabod, and &s;ay, the Glory is depart|ed from us; but that the Name whereby we &s;hall be called, &s;hall be <HI>Jehovah Shammah,</HI> the Lord is there. And <HI>happy is that People, who&s;e God is the Lord.</HI></P>
