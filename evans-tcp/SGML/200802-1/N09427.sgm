<P>_THE Attention of Americans has of late been uncommonly rou&s;ed, and deeply engag'd about the pub|lic Good. We have look'd on our invaluable Liberties, and important Privileges to be in Danger. And &s;uch a ge|neral
<PB N="6" REF="012013_0005_0F89401AAEB50FD0">
Concern relative to the&s;e Things, and Zeal for their Pre&s;ervation, has prevailed a|mong us, as Regard for Liberty is wont to in&s;pire a free People with.&mdash;In &s;uch an alarm|ing Situation, many invincible Rea&s;ons have been offered in &s;upport of our ju&s;t and im|portant Rights; many Expedients of a poli|tical and prudential Nature have been urg'd with great Force, and pre&s;s'd upon us by very weighty Motives: And may they have their Effect&mdash;The De&s;ign of them is certainly No|ble and Important.</P>
<P>BUT there are doubtle&s;s Con&s;iderations of a moral and religious Nature, which ought to command our Attention, and which are really of far greater Importance, both to our pre&s;ent and future Happine&s;s, than any Thing meerly civil or political can be.&mdash;Indeed the chief and ultimate De&s;ign of Religion, as it re&s;pects Mankind, is to deliver us from the fatal Effects of the Apo&s;tacy, and to fit us for a State of perfect Holine&s;s and Happine&s;s in the coming World. But this is not all; Godline&s;s has the Promi&s;e of the Life that now is, as well as of that which is to come. And it tends to the pre&s;ent Happine&s;s not only of Individuals, but the Love and Prac|tice of it has a mo&s;t friendly A&s;pect on pub|lic Weal; and the neglect of it the mo&s;t di|rect Tendency to the Mi&s;ery and De&s;truction of a State.&mdash;Several Con&s;iderations of this
<PB N="7" REF="012013_0006_0F89401B70013328">
Nature, and of great Importance, are &s;ugge&s;|ted to us from our Text and Context.</P>
<P>THE Jews were become a very wicked and abandoned People, at the Time when God &s;ent this Me&s;&s;age to them by the Prophet. Many Threatnings, and of fore Calamities had been frequently denounced again&s;t them, which had as yet, very little, or rather no Effect to reform them. The Prophet Jere|miah is directed therefore to go to the Place where the Potter fa&s;hioned his Ve&s;&s;els of Clay: There he ob&s;erved that the Potter had an uncontrolled Power to form the&s;e Ve&s;&s;els as he plea&s;ed: If they would not &s;erve for one Purpo&s;e he could very ea&s;ily turn them to another. From this lively Similitude, the Prophet is ordered to repre&s;ent to the Jews God's &s;overeign Power over the mo&s;t formi|dable States and exten&s;ive Empires: And with how much Ea&s;e God either exalts or depre&s;&s;es them, pro&s;pers or afflicts, encrea&s;es or dimini&s;hes, or in a Word, pre&s;erves or de|&s;troys them. And God has certainly a greater Right to do this, than the Potter has to new Mould the Clay of which he is not the ab|&s;olute Proprietor.</P>
<P>THIS was true in Jeremiah's Time, and is equally true now; and really it is a Truth of very great Importance to be con&s;idered and realized; for it &s;hews us that we are
<PB N="8" REF="012013_0007_0F89401C2E578298">
ab&s;olutely dependent on God for our all:&mdash;Pro&s;perity or Adver&s;ity, whether private or public, is entirely from God.</P>
<P>BUT God gives us to under&s;tand in our (Text, that whatever his Power and Sove|reignty might enable him to do,) he con|ducts not only according to the invariable Rules of Ju&s;tice and Equity, which gives us the greate&s;t A&s;&s;urance that he never will wrong any People, or bring any Evil upon them, meerly to &s;hew him&s;elf Sovereign, but farther that he is di&s;po&s;ed to treat Man|kind according to the Rules of Clemency and Kindne&s;s: So that when a Nation or Kingdom have been guilty of a Conduct cri|minal to that Degree, that they have greatly provoked God, and which would ju&s;tify him in proceeding to the la&s;t Extremities with them; yea, if God had proceeded &s;o far as to threaten them with utter Ruin, if after all this, they &s;hould even then repent, and turn from their evil Ways to God, he would avert the Tokens of his Di&s;plea&s;ure, recall the Threatnings, pro&s;per and e&s;tabli&s;h them.</P>
<P>ON the other Hand, God lets them know that whatever Encouragement he had given of granting Enlargement and Pro&s;perity to any State; if they after this degenerate and back&s;lide, to that Degree, that their Chara|cter becomes that of Evil Doers, an unrigh|teous, ungodly People, they forfeit his Pro|mi&s;e
<PB N="9" REF="012013_0008_0F89401D42964AE0">
and Protection; and if they continue irreclaimable, he will not build them up, but de&s;troy them.</P>
<P>IT is worthy of Ob&s;ervation, that the Declarations made in our Text relative to God's providential Di&s;pen&s;ations, are not confined to the Jews; they are of a general Nature, and publi&s;hed in an indefinite Man|ner: Whence it appears that God Almighty de&s;igns here to exhibit a general Rule of his Conduct towards public Bodies or Commu|nities.</P>
<P>IT is indeed true that we have no Rea&s;on to expect an exact Corre&s;pondence between God's providential Di&s;pen&s;ations towards the Jews and other Kingdoms or civil Commu|nities. Yet as God is the moral Governor of the World, and approves of Virtue and Holine&s;s wherever it appears, and always hates Sin and Wickedne&s;s among all Nati|ons; &s;o it is rea&s;onable to believe he will &s;hew his Approbation, Favour and Protection to the one, and frown upon and puni&s;h the other. The State of the Ca&s;e is very different (as to the Time of Rewards and Puni&s;hments) between Individuals and pub|lic Bodies of Men. The future State is the Time of Retribution to Individuals.&mdash;Though therefore many among the godly may &s;uffer very grievous Things in this pre&s;ent State, they &s;hall be abundantly Re|warded
<PB N="10" REF="012013_0009_0F89401EE2446E30">
hereafter: In that happy World Light is &s;own for the Righteous, and glad|ne&s;s for the upright in Heart. And how|ever the wicked may flouri&s;h and pro&s;per here, their triumphing is &s;hort, for it is that they may be cut off and de&s;troyed. But the Ca&s;e is very different with regard to civil Communities. Whatever Forms of Admini|&s;tration they a&s;&s;ume, they are the Creatures of Time. They have no Exi&s;tence but in this World&mdash;All their Bands of Society, as Bodies-Politic, are di&s;&s;olved, and have no Exi&s;tence in a future State. If therefore they are not rewarded or puni&s;hed in &s;ome Proportion to their Character as righteous or &s;inful in this World, they never are at all. It appears therefore agreeable to the Divine Perfections, that God &s;hould &s;hew vi&s;ible Marks of Approbation of public Virtue, and frown upon and puni&s;h a &s;inful People, as in our Text he has expre&s;sly declared he will do.</P>
<P>IT appears then that God &s;peaks to us in the&s;e Days as really, tho' not in the &s;ame Manner as he did to Nations and Kingdoms in ancient Times. To them he &s;pake by im|mediate and particular Me&s;&s;ages from Heaven, pointing out their Sins, and the particular and &s;pecial Judgments which they might a&s;&s;uredly expect if they continued Incorrigible. To us he &s;peaks by his written. Word and his
<PB N="11" REF="012013_0010_0F89401F2DEF9908">
Providence. In his Word he &s;hews us what is the Character of &s;uch a People as have Encouragement to hope for his Favour, or Rea&s;on to fear his Di&s;plea&s;ure;&mdash;and what he ju&s;tly expects from &s;uch a People as have wickedly departed from him, that they may be re&s;tored to Favour, and enjoy his Smiles. Many Examples are left us in &s;acred Scrip|ture for our In&s;truction and Admonition. Thus God &s;peaks to us now, and &s;urely the Man of Wi&s;dom will hear what God &s;peak|eth to the City and to the Country. We mu&s;t carefully examine into our real Chara|cter, and compare it to that of other Com|munities, and then con&s;ider how God has declared he would treat them, and what Treatment they have in fact met with, and from thence collect what we have to hope for, or to fear from the Hand of God.</P>
<P>THAT which may be further attempted, by Divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance, will be to &s;hew,
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. THAT the Love and Practice of Re|ligion has the greate&s;t Encouragement of God's Favour; and therefore is the &s;ure&s;t Means of the Happine&s;s of a People.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. THAT the prevalence of Irreligion and Wickedne&s;s have a dreadful Tendency to their De&s;truction;</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="012013_0011_0F89401FEE6A3F78">
And,
<LIST>
<ITEM>III. THAT if a People have revolted from God, Repentance and Reformation will be the &s;ure&s;t and be&s;t Means to prevent their Ruin, and re&s;tore them to the Divine Favour.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I. THE fir&s;t Thing propo&s;ed is to &s;how, that the Love and Practice of Religion has the greate&s;t Encouragement of God's Fa|vour, and therefore is the &s;ure&s;t Means of the Happine&s;s of a People.</P>
<P>THIS is implied in the Text. 'Tis indeed taken for granted, that God will ble&s;s and pro&s;per a People who continue holy and obe|dient. Such who do not Evil in his Sight, but obey his Voice. The&s;e are Phra&s;es fre|quently u&s;ed in the Writings of the Prophets to decypher true Religion. But we mu&s;t always remember that a right Temper of Heart is always included in this Obedience to the Voice of God: otherwi&s;e it is de&s;titute of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential Property of Obedience.&mdash;A &s;upreme Love to God, on Account of his tran&s;cendent Excellence and ab&s;olute Per|fection: an ultimate Regard to his Honour, and a Di&s;po&s;ition to be &s;ubject to his Will, are e&s;&s;ential Ingredients in Obedience to the Voice of God. This Voice of God is no o|ther than his Word, and when we have &s;uch a Temper of Mind as the Word of God re|quires; when we believe and live as God

requires we &s;hould do in his Word, then are we religious.</P>
<P><Q>ALL the great Truths and Duties of Morality are adopted by Chri&s;t, and in|corporated into his Laws, are refined and purified, and &s;et in the faire&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t Point of Light, and rai&s;ed to their highe&s;t Perfection in the Chri&s;tian In&s;titution.</Q> This Word or Voice of God di&s;covers his glorious Nature and amiable Perfections, in Conformity to which, the Happine&s;s of all intelligent Beings con&s;i&s;ts.&mdash;It &s;hews that Mankind, tho' originally created in the Im|age of God, have fallen from him, and are become both guilty and polluted by Sin.&mdash;The &s;urprizing Method of Redemption by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the great Mediator; and the Recovery to a holy Temper and Life, which (thro' Divine Influence) always takes Place in all who are by Faith in him, made parta|kers of the great Salvation. All the&s;e glori|ous Truths in one connected View, all that Holine&s;s that is required, and tho&s;e Duties which are directed to in God's Word, tend to promote the Happine&s;s of civil Commu|nities; for God has mo&s;t plainly &s;hewn in his Word</P>
<P>THAT, Religion, and this only, will re|commend to his Favour.</P>
<P>THAT, the Religion which God's Word requires, is &s;o framed, as in the very Nature
<PB N="14" REF="012013_0013_0F8940216FFBD428">
and Genius of it, to have a tendency to pro|mote the public Good.</P>
<P>AND this Word of God points out many Duties to Men, in all Characters, Relations and Circum&s;tances, which directly and im|mediately tend to promote the be&s;t Good of the State.</P>
<P N="1">1. GOD has mo&s;t plainly &s;hewn in his Word, that Religion, and only this will re|commend to his Favour. Very many are the Promi&s;es of this Kind. God promi&s;ed the I&s;raelites,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Deut. 28. 1.</NOTE> that if they would hearken dili|gently to the Voice of the Lord their God, to do all his Commandments, the Lord their God would &s;et them on High, above all the Nations of the Earth. And thus al&s;o &s;aid the Lord to them by the Prophet Azariah,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Chron. 15. 2.</NOTE> <Q>Hear ye me A&s;a and all Judah and Ben|jamin, the Lord is with you while ye be with him; and if ye &s;eek him he will be found of you; but if ye for&s;ake him, he will for&s;ake you.</Q> Many other Promi&s;es of this Kind, taken in connection with our Text, are &s;o plain as to put this Matter be|yond all Doubt; for they are made not only to particular Per&s;ons, but to civil Commu|nities as &s;uch.</P>
<P>I proceed therefore to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>THAT</HI> Religion, which God's Word
<PB N="15" REF="012013_0014_0F8940222FD2BCA0">
requires, is &s;o framed, as in the very Nature and Genius of it to have a tendency to pro|mote the public Good. It might ea&s;ily be &s;hewn, (were there Time) that the more general Requi&s;itions and Prohibitions con|tained in that Religion which is de&s;cribed and required in the Word of God, have all a tendency to promote the Good of civil Society: But what I would e&s;pecially in&s;i&s;t on under this Head is, that the Religion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t forms Men to &s;uch a Temper as powerfully inclines them to promote the Intere&s;t of the Public.</P>
<P>THE Depravity of humane Nature, the corrupted and vitiated Temper of Mens Minds, is the real original Source of all tho&s;e wicked Practices, which are prejudicial both to their private and public Intere&s;ts. Hence proceed all tho&s;e open, bold Violations of God's Law, tho&s;e enormous Crimes and De|baucheries, which tend to the Ruin and Di&s;|&s;olution of a State. This Fountain mu&s;t be clean&s;ed, or putrid Streams will continue to flow. And when this Temper is changed, the Heart renew'd and made holy, the Man will be &s;trongly and vigorou&s;ly engaged in all the Duties of Holine&s;s; and con&s;equently to promote the public Tranquility.</P>
<P>Now, (<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Rev'd Mr. Lockwood, of Weathersfield, in his Election Sermon for 1754.</NOTE> as one &s;ays) <Q>the Go&s;pel and Re|ligion
<PB N="16" REF="012013_0015_0F894022EE8B2558">
of Je&s;us is admirably de&s;ign'd and calculated to produce this ble&s;&s;ed Effect; and this ble&s;&s;ed Effect it does and will actually produce, wherever it is cordially and &s;incerely entertained and &s;ubmitted to. Hence we are &s;aid to be &s;anctified by the Word; to be born again, not of cor|ruptible Seed, but of Incorruptible, by the Word of God, which liveth and abideth forever. The Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, attended by the &s;acred Influences of the Divine Spirit, is the powerful Means of rectifying the &s;inful Nature of Man, and forming it to Purity and Holine&s;s, and a governing Di&s;po&s;ition to plea&s;e and obey God in all Things. As the Laws of Religion require the univer&s;al Practice of Virtue &amp; Holine&s;s; they that are truly Religious, choo&s;e to obey God and live holy Lives; there is a ble&s;&s;ed Agreement &amp; Harmony, tho' not a perfect one between the Temper of their Minds, and the &s;acred Laws of Religion; they are not only aw'd and influenced by the Authority and Command of God, but they find an inward Propen&s;ity and Di&s;|po&s;ition to devote and approve them&s;elves to God, not only in the Duties of Piety and Godline&s;s, but in the Performance of all relative and &s;ocial Duties, and to exert them&s;elves in their Places, to promote the
<PB N="17" REF="012013_0016_0F894023B09A13E0">
Welfare of Mankind, and the Tranquility and Happine&s;s of the State.</Q></P>
<P>I proceed to &s;ay</P>
<P N="3">3. RELIGION requires and implies many Duties in the various Characters, Relations and Circum&s;tances of Life, which tend immedi|ately to the Good of the State. And an inward Principle of Piety will prompt Men readily to perform them. A hint of the principal of the&s;e Duties as they re&s;pect Ru|lers and Subjects, will be all I have Time now to mention.   And,</P>
<P>UNDER the Influence of Religion, Rulers will di&s;charge the Duties of their important Tru&s;t with &s;trict Fidelity. In the height of Elevation, they will not forget they have a Ma&s;ter in Heaven, to whom they are ac|countable, before whom they mu&s;t &s;hortly &s;tand, &s;trip'd of all the Robes of State and En&s;igns of Grandeur, to give an Account of their Steward&s;hip. They know God requires them, while they rule over Men, to &s;erve the Lord, to &s;erve him with Fear &amp; to rejoice with Trembling.&mdash;Religion will influence and em|bolden them to di&s;tribute Ju&s;tice with Im|partiality and Intrepidity; knowing that it is an Ordinance of Him that ruleth among the Gods, That he that ruleth over Men mu&s;t be ju&s;t, ruling in the fear of God. In Obedience to this great Lord, they will en|deavour to let Judgment run down as Wa|ters,
<PB N="18" REF="012013_0017_0F8940246FE21E20">
and Righteou&s;ne&s;s as a mighty Stream, as an irre&s;i&s;table Torrent, bearing down all Oppo&s;ition, and &s;weeping away Wickedne&s;s, Oppre&s;&s;ion and Inju&s;tice from the Earth.&mdash;Religion, in the Life and Spirit of it, would di&s;po&s;e Rulers to be &s;o far from any Aims after arbitrary Power, as to be zealous Guar|dians of the ju&s;t and important Rights of the Subject. It would greatly Influence, not only by making them afraid to &s;et them&s;elves again&s;t the Lord, and again&s;t his Anointed; but would temper the Thoughts of Dignity, cure a godle&s;s Thir&s;t for De&s;poti&s;m, and &s;o keep them back from all guilty Reaches after arbitrary Power, and teach them to conduct as the Mini&s;ters of God for the good of their Subjects.&mdash;Religion would, above all other Things in&s;pire them with paternal Tenderne&s;s, &amp; engage them to act as Fathers of the People. There is no other Principle of true Patriot|i&s;m equal to that of Religion. Men have indeed &s;ometimes from lower Principles than tho&s;e of Chri&s;tianity done well for the Public: But certainly no other Principles can actuate them with equal Force and A|lacrity to pur&s;ue the public Good. A Prin|ciple of Holine&s;s is of a divine Original, and not only fills the Mind with Veneration and Awe of the Divine Maje&s;ty, but in&s;pires the Heart with Love to God and Man. Such
<PB N="19" REF="012013_0018_0F8940252F1008E0">
a Principle will enlarge the Ruler's Heart, and engage him with unre&s;trained Benevo|lence to pur&s;ue the Good of all. Such Ru|lers would therefore willingly exert all their Powers, and employ their whole Time for the Intere&s;t of their Country. And no doubt their greate&s;t and mo&s;t valuable Intere&s;ts will proportionably excite the generous Concern of &s;uch Rulers.&mdash;The Regulation of Com|merce&mdash;The Encouragement of Agriculture and Manufactures&mdash;The Promotion of Lear|ning&mdash;The Pre&s;ervation or Re&s;toration of Liberty&mdash;But above all, Religion will meet with their warme&s;t Encouragement, be pa|tronized by their Example, and their Hearts will bleed for their People when under the Rebukes of Heaven, or dreadfully expo&s;ed to the Frowns of an angry God for their A|po&s;tacy from him.&mdash;In a Word, what like Religion will be a &s;ource of Magnanimity and Fortitude in Sea&s;ons of &s;pecial Danger?</P>
<P>WHEN nothing but the Te&s;timony of an unreproaching Con&s;cience, and the plaudit of the Omni&s;cient Judge can yield Support, what but this will &s;upport them when re|pay'd with I gratitude for their noble and Self-denying Exertions for the Good of their Country? What but Religion will in&s;pirit them with Re&s;olution to per&s;i&s;t with unre|mitted Vigour and unabated Diligence, tho'
<PB N="20" REF="012013_0019_0F894025EE55A220">
the more abundantly they Love the le&s;s they are beloved? What like Religion will arm tho&s;e in Power again&s;t the Temptations to Pride and Luxury, Venality and Oppre&s;&s;ion which an elevated Station peculiarly expo&s;es to? In fine; Religion and this only will Influence them to exhibit &s;uch an Example as &s;hall have the greate&s;t Tendency to reform a de|generate and back&s;liding People. As they are Gods by Office, Religion will render them God-like in the Temper of their Minds, in their public Admini&s;trations, and in private Life. Such an Example as this would have a peculiar Tendency to give Charms to Vir|tue, to make Religion appear reputable and amiable, and to reform a vicious Age.</P>
<P>FROM the&s;e particulars it appears that Re|ligion in Rulers, not only in Speculation, but in Love and Practice; not only protect|ed by whole&s;ome Laws, but appearing in real Life, and in high Life, would have a Tendency directly to promote public Feli|city.</P>
<P>AND no le&s;s would it do &s;o with Regard to Subjects. The Religion of Chri&s;t directs Mankind in general to many Duties which have the mo&s;t direct Tendency to render a State pro&s;perous at home, and re&s;pectable a|broad; and, when it is cordially embraced, will effectually incline them to &s;uch a Con|duct:

That Benevolence which is the very Life and Soul of the Religion of the Go&s;pel, embraces the whole Sy&s;tem of Beings, thro' the Univer&s;e, in the Arms of di&s;in|tere&s;ted Love.

De&s;truction of a People: As Righteou&s;ne&s;s exalts a Nation, &s;o Sin is a reproach to any People. The general Practice of Wicked|ne&s;s, nece&s;&s;arily dimini&s;hes and weakens a State, and if Impenitently per&s;i&s;ted in will terminate in their final ruin.&mdash;If &s;uch Per|&s;ons as are promoted to Places of Power and Tru&s;t, and fill the Seats of Government, are de&s;titute of Principles of Piety, void of In|tegrity and Honor, it will have a baleful In|fluence on the State of the People whom they govern. Whatever Talents or Accom|pli&s;hments they are Ma&s;ters of, while de&s;ti|tute of the&s;e, there can be no &s;ufficient Se|curity of their proving public Ble&s;&s;ings: Mo&s;t probably the noble&s;t Talents will be abu&s;ed and pro&s;tituted to &s;erve the vile Purpo&s;es of Ambition, Avarice or Luxury, as their lead|ing Pa&s;&s;ion chances to direct. And what can be expected under &s;uch Rulers but a perpe|tual Series of Di&s;tre&s;&s;es and Judgments? What but Scenes of Oppre&s;&s;ion, Violence, Corruption and Effeminacy?</P>
<P>THE Examples of &s;uch Men will be very fatal. <Q>If Magi&s;trates have the Characters of Rulers of Sodom, it may be expected that their Subjects will be the People of Gomorrah.</Q> The wi&s;e King of I&s;rael ob&s;erves, If a Ruler hearken to lies, all the People are wicked. When therefore Rulers

take no Care to make and execute &s;uch Laws as are calculated to &s;uppre&s;s Vice and Wick|edne&s;s, and to encourage Virtue and Religi|on, much more if Oppre&s;&s;ion, Venality or any Kind of Iniquity is encouraged; or if by their evil Example they enervate the force of Laws, and put it out of their own Power to execute them to Advantage; they give a public Invitation to their Subjects to &s;hake off all Re&s;traints to Sin, and to com|mit Iniquity with Greedine&s;s. Such Rulers have brought infinite Mi&s;chief on the State. <Q>They have (as one &s;ays) like baleful Comets, &s;pread Plagues and De&s;olation through a Land, by their malignant Influ|ences.</Q> &mdash; But,</P>
<P>HOWEVER virtuous, wi&s;e, faithful and ex|emplary Rulers are, if Vice and Irreligion prevail among the People, &s;o that their go|verning Character is that of a &s;inful People, they have awful Rea&s;on to Tremble at God's Di&s;plea&s;ure: Indeed, according to that De|gree in which Sin prevails, it naturally weak|ens and injures the public Intere&s;t, as plainly appears from what has been already ob&s;erved. For in the &s;ame Proportion that Religion tends to the public Emolument, Irreligion tends to the Damage of the State.&mdash;God, the moral and righteous Governor of the World, has &s;o con&s;tituted the Nature of Things, and orde|red

the general Cour&s;e of his Providence, that the Con&s;equences of Sin in general, &s;hould be very pernicious to the Temporal as well as the future and eternal Intere&s;ts of Men. Nothing is more obvious than that many Sins tend to bring Mi&s;ery, and indeed &s;wiftly to ha&s;ten Ruin and De&s;truction on that People among whom they prevail.</P>
<P>THUS Pride and Luxury, Venality, Inju&s;|tice and Oppre&s;&s;ion, Intemperance and De|bauchery will have a mo&s;t fatal Influence and &s;wiftly ha&s;ten on every Kind of Mi&s;ery. Di&s;&s;ipation, Indigence and Beggary tread on the Heels of Luxury, Pride and Prodigality. Men of this Character, thus reduced by their evil Cour&s;es, often betake them&s;elves to Pra|ctices pernicious and ruinous to their Coun|try, &s;uch as Robbery, Theft, Counterfeiting, or if not to the&s;e, to others, if not &s;o &s;can|dalous, yet very hurtful and pernicious; &s;uch as &s;harping, over-reaching, and the like.&mdash;Idlene&s;s often cloaths a Man with Rags, and reduces whole Families to the mo&s;t forlorn and pitiable Circum&s;tances. How often do the &s;lothful and indolent plunge deep into &s;ome of the above-mentioned Vices? or in|to Intemperance, which is a Vice which may properly be more particularly mentioned and in&s;i&s;ted on, as it contains in Embrio all other Vices.

And with Regard to States and Kingdoms, all Hi&s;tory Witne&s;&s;es, that when &s;uch Sins have prevailed &s;o as to be|come the general Character, they have been on the very Brink of De&s;truction.

<P>THERE are other Sins, &s;uch as Idolatry, Prophanene&s;s, contempt of the Grace of God, Incorrigiblene&s;s under Cha&s;ti&s;ements and the various Means which God is u&s;ing for the Recovery of a back&s;liding People, which are daring Affronts and aggravated Provocations to Almighty God, and more direct and immediate in&s;ults upon his Ho|nor; and therefore that People who are and continue Guilty of them, may expect &s;evere Frowns and &s;pecial Judgments from Heaven.&mdash;The God who governs univer&s;al Nature will often &s;pecially interpo&s;e to di&s;tre&s;s and

<P>THIS brings me to the la&s;t Ob&s;ervation;</P>
<P>III. THAT if a People have revolted from God, Repentance and Reformation are the mo&s;t certain and be&s;t Means to prevent their Ruin, and re&s;tore them to the divine Favour. Indeed the&s;e are the only Things mentioned in the Text. It is true, when a
<PB N="28" REF="012013_0027_0F89402CAFEF5CC0">
People by their own Folly and Prodigality are reduced into low Circum&s;tances, or are threatned with &s;ore Judgments and heavy Calamities, they are to u&s;e all proper Means of a civil and prudential Nature, as well as tho&s;e which more &s;trictly &s;peaking are of a religious Kind. Frugality, a prudent Regu|lation of civil and commercial Affairs, a vi|gorous Exertion to pre&s;erve their ju&s;t Rights, are all highly rea&s;onable and nece&s;&s;ary; they are no ways incon&s;i&s;tent with Religion or contrary to Repentance. But all the&s;e are in&s;ufficient without Repentance. They can|not en&s;ure Succe&s;s; they have no Promi&s;e from God. In a Word, whatever be their Struggles and Exertions; whatever the Ex|pedients they u&s;e, yet if they leave Repent|ance out of the Que&s;tion, they are very far from any certainty of Succe&s;s; rather they have Rea&s;on to fear that the be&s;t concerted Plans will prove abortive, and that God will teach them by Experience, that the Race is not to the &s;wift, nor the Battle to the &s;trong, that their own Strength is Weakne&s;s, and that Salvation is only from the Lord.</P>
<P>IT is allowed that in &s;ome extraordinary Ca&s;es God has for &s;ome Time &s;pared a very &s;inful People from immediate and impend|ing Ruin upon the Interce&s;&s;ion of eminently godly Men. Thus he &s;pared I&s;rael at the
<PB N="29" REF="012013_0028_0F89402D6FF56F70">
reque&s;t of Mo&s;es on their Behalf. But in this Ca&s;e God took &s;ufficient Care to &s;ecure the honour of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Law, by the &s;ignal Pu|ni&s;hment which he inflicted on them who were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">, tho' he did not de&s;troy the whole <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Notwith&s;tanding he heard the Prayer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> he &s;ays;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Num. 14. 21.</NOTE> <Q>But as truly as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> the Earth &s;hall be filled with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> the Lord.</Q> This threatning God accompli&s;hed when he &s;hut tho&s;e murmuring, &s;tiff necked I&s;raelites out of the Land of Canaan, and their Carca&s;es peri&s;hed in the W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">s.</P>
<P>BUT tho' God has in his great Clemency &s;pared a People for &s;ome Time, who&s;e ge|neral Character was very bad, on Account of the godly living with them, and e&s;pecially when with Fervency and Importunity they have interceeded for them; or tho' he may have &s;u&s;pended the immediate Execution of Puni&s;hment on the Account of a partial or meerly external Reformation; I believe Re|pentance attended with Reformation as the general Character of a People, has the only certain Encouragement of the divine For|givene&s;s and Favour. Such Repentance as is &s;incere, univer&s;al and evangelical; as im|plies an inwrought godly Sorrow for Sin, as again&s;t a God of infinite Purity, Righteou&s;|ne&s;s
<PB N="30" REF="012013_0029_0F89402E2FD6F6A8">
and Goodne&s;s; as produces an inward, real aver&s;ion to all Sin, and endeavours a|gain&s;t it. Such a Repentance, wherein the Soul taking its whole Encouragements from the Mercy of God revealed and manife&s;ted in the divine Redeemer, returns to God by a glorious Chri&s;t, as its rightful, original So|vereign and only Happine&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in a Word, &s;uch a Repentance wherein every Sin is for|&s;aken. Reformation from all evil Ways, and a Practice of all moral and chri&s;tian Duties will accompany true Repentance.</P>
<P>AND where &s;uch a Repentance takes Place, though among a People who have been very wicked, and who&s;e back&s;lidings have been attended with the mo&s;t crim&s;on Aggravati|ons, it will be a Means of averting the di|vine Di&s;plea&s;ure. God will return in Mercy to them, and build them up. The many clear and po&s;itive Declarations which God has made in his Word, that Repentance and Reformation are agreeable to him, are indi&s;|pen&s;ibly required by him, and are the only Terms on which he will turn away from his Di&s;plea&s;ure and be reconciled; and the undoubted Evidence which we have that the&s;e have been frequently the Means of averting impending Danger, and &s;aving from de&s;erved Ruin; are &s;ufficient to put this Matter out of all doubt; and therefore &s;hould
<PB N="31" REF="012013_0030_0F89402EEF4234A0">
be an effectual Inducement to a People, how|ever &s;inful and degenerate, however afflicted, or however threatned, though on the very Borders of Extermination, to turn to God, through Chri&s;t, by unfeigned Repentance. The kind Declarations and Promi&s;es which God made to the Jews, of this Nature, are very many and expre&s;s; and they were con|tinued even to the la&s;t; when they were on the Brink of Ruin. Such was their Dege|neracy that God &s;ays of them,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai. 1. 5.</NOTE> <Q>Ah &s;inful Nation! a People laden with Iniquity! a Seed of evil-doers!

The Mea&s;ure of their Sins was full, and God &s;eems to be bringing Evil on them, even to the uttermo&s;t. He was ju&s;t about to pluck up, to pull down and to de&s;troy.&mdash;The Nation is here compared to a Vine|yard; the Similitude is pertinent, and the threatned De&s;truction compleat. If the Fences be thrown down which &s;urrounded the Vineyard, the Vines plucked up by the

<P>I MIGHT al&s;o &s;hew many In&s;tances in which God has appeared in his providence, &amp; &s;ignally delivered a penitent People from multiplied Di&s;tre&s;&s;es; but it is needle&s;s to re|cite particular Facts for the Purpo&s;e, &s;ince every one acquainted with &s;acred Hi&s;tory e&s;|pecially

Then they cried unto the Lord in their Trouble, and he &s;aved them out of their Di&s;tre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>FROM what has been &s;aid may be inferred the &s;uperlative Excellency of Religion, which is calculated to promote the noble&s;t Ends, viz. to form Men in every Character and Relation to love and honour God, and to pur|&s;ue and promote the highe&s;t Intere&s;t and true&s;t Happine&s;s of Mankind.</P>
<P>WE may al&s;o infer the inexcu&s;able Folly of wicked Men, who while they are inor|dinately per&s;uing their pre&s;ent and private Intere&s;t, in the neglect and contempt of Re|ligion, act in direct Oppo&s;ition to both, and &s;o expo&s;e them&s;elves to everla&s;ting De&s;truc|tion, for le&s;s, for wor&s;e than nothing.</P>
<P>WE learn further, that it is a Thing of the la&s;t Importance to a People who are un|der the evident Frowns of Heaven, critically to examine what is their real Character: And if it &s;hould appear that they have done Evil in God's Sight, and have not obeyed

So great a part of the &s;pecial Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, is to inculcate Re|pentance, and promote Reformation; and &s;uch is the general Character of this Order of Men in this Government, that I cannot doubt of their cordial Concurrence and &s;in|cere Endeavours to promote a Work &s;o Im|portant and nece&s;&s;ary at this Day.</P>
<P>Reverend Fathers and Brethren,
IN this apo&s;tate and &s;inful World it has ever been the Errand on which God has &s;ent forth his Amba&s;&s;adors to preach Re|pentance, and Reconciliation to God, through a Mediator; and at &s;pecial &s;ea&s;ons to give Warning of impending Danger, and incul|cate Repentance and Reformation, by all po&s;&s;ible Motives.</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. 3. 19, 20.</NOTE> NOAH warned the antediluvian World of imminent De&s;truction, and inculcated Repentance for a long Space. This was the great Errand on which the Prophets were &s;ent to the Jews. The Burden of all their Me&s;&s;ages was, Turn now unto the Lord with all your Hearts. And as their Sins increa&s;ed and God's Judgments were more numerous and awful, and e&s;pecially when the impend|ing Storm thickned, and &s;eem'd ready to bur&s;t on their guilty and defencele&s;s Heads,

the Prophets were ordered to redouble their Efforts, and with an hone&s;t Freedom and pious Zeal, point out their Danger, and the Rea&s;ons of it. Thus I&s;aiah is directed to<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai. 58. 1.</NOTE> cry aloud and &s;pare not, to lift up his Voice like a Trumpet, and to &s;hew unto God's Peo|ple their Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion.&mdash;The weeping Pro|phet is &s;ent with many &s;uch Me&s;&s;ages as that in our Text.&mdash;When John, the immediate Fore-runner of Chri&s;t appear'd, he cried,<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">Mat. 3. 2.</NOTE> <Q>Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at Hand.</Q>&mdash;And our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, as the fir&s;t of all his Me&s;&s;ages, proclaimed,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mark 1. 15.</NOTE> <Q>Re|pent, and believe the Go&s;pel.</Q> And to add no more In&s;tances, St. Paul in few Words tells us what was the main Bu&s;ine&s;s and Practice of the fir&s;t Preachers of the Go&s;pel, (and which no doubt we &s;hould imitate them in)<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. 5. 20.</NOTE> <Q>Now then we are Amba&s;&s;adors of God, as tho' God did be&s;eech you by us, we pray you in Chri&s;t's &s;tead, be ye recon|ciled to God.</Q> And does not the Provi|dence of God point out to us many peculiar Motives and loud Warnings, to be very ear|ne&s;t, vigilant and diligent in pre&s;&s;ing Repen|tance and Reformation, on the People of this Government? Perhaps never in this Land was there greater need of Reformation, or louder calls to it. God expects we &s;hould

join with our worthy Rulers in this mo&s;t important Work, and not only faithfully &s;hew this People their Sins and De&s;erts, but &s;incerely bewail their and our own Sins, and deprecate God's Judgments. In this Day of Darkne&s;s and Di&s;tre&s;s, ought not the Prie&s;ts, the Mini&s;ters of the Lord, above all others, to weep and to &s;ay, <Q>Spare thy People, O Lord, and give not up thine Heritage to Reproach.</Q> In brief, it appears clearly that Repentance and Reformation are that one Thing needful at this Day, on which our political and temporal Salvation, as well as our eternal depends; and that God ju&s;tly expects that we, above all others, &s;hould be &s;en&s;ible of it, and endeavour to promote them. This then &s;hould engro&s;s our Thoughts, en|gage our Solicitude, and employ our Time.</P>
<P>AND I would humbly &s;ugge&s;t, that as we would &s;ucceed in our Endeavours, we mu&s;t hold fa&s;t the Form of found Words, and adhere inviolably to the Doctrines of Grace, tho&s;e great Important Doctrines, which our pious Ance&s;tors held, and for which they &s;uffered: 'Tis the plain, faithful preaching of the&s;e which is like to be attended with Succe&s;s.

<P>MAY I be allowed ju&s;t to add, that Union among our&s;elves is greatly nece&s;&s;ary, that we may be &s;ucce&s;sful in our Endeavours to pro|mote the Intere&s;t of Religion among others.</P>
<P>SCARCE any Thing has given a greater Advantage to the Enemies of the Church, than that Di&s;cord which has prevailed among Chri&s;tians; or any Thing &s;tab'd the Cau&s;e of Religion with deeper Wounds than tho&s;e Contentions and unchri&s;tian Alienations which have took Place among the Clergy: may they never prevail among us; may we let alone Contention before it is any further meddled with. While we contend for the Faith, may we take heed that it is indeed the Faith of the Go&s;pel, and tho&s;e plain, great, important Truths which have a Ten|dency to promote practical Godline&s;s, and not &s;ubtil Speculations and &s;chola&s;tic Niceties:

And while we look upon our&s;elves obliged to contend earne&s;tly, let us al&s;o contend meekly, and not loo&s;e Sight of Charity, in the Defence of Orthodoxy. Should not this thought, that there are cruel Foes enough abroad, watching for our halting, and re|joicing in our Divi&s;ions, cement us in the clo&s;e&s;t Union to one another? Should we not, as Servants of the meek and lowly Je|&s;us, forbear one another in Love, and unite in this Day of great Degeneracy and Cala|mity, in every probable, &s;uitable and prudent Method to promote the common Good:&mdash;Above all, are we not under the mo&s;t &s;acred Obligations to join in humble fervent Sup|plications, to that God who heareth Prayer, who loves Unity and Fervency in our Re|que&s;ts, who has never &s;aid to the Hou&s;e of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain; who has often in an&s;wer to the united, humble Petitions of his Servants, appeared for Zion, and for New-England in particular.

probably decide the Fate of America: That to be unconcern'd therefore in this Conjunc|ture of Affairs mu&s;t be the Effect of the mo&s;t &s;tupid Dulne&s;s, or unaccountable Frenzy: And that we are under indi&s;pen&s;ible Obliga|tions to u&s;e the mo&s;t vigorous Efforts, and practice much of Self-denial (if call'd to it) for the good of our Country.
