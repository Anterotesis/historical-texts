<P>AS every invention, di&s;covery, or improve|ment, is more or le&s;s u&s;eful and intere&s;ting, in proportion as it contributes to the pre&s;ervation of health, life, pro&s;perity, and &s;atisfaction; and as the author of the following pages is per&s;uaded, that very material improvements were made in the treatment of the &s;ynochus icteroides or yel|low fever, which lately prevailed in this city, and proved &s;o de&s;tructive and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to its in|habitants, he thinks it his duty to lay the &s;ame before the public, together with his ob&s;erva|tions and &s;entiments on other circum&s;tances, relative to that di&s;ea&s;e; that if it &s;hould ever appear here again (as there is too much rea|&s;on

He however does not pretend to have been the improver of the treatment, or the di&s;cover|er of the means mo&s;t effectual in the cure, which is recommended in the following pa|ges. On the contrary, he believes they were adopted from the joint deliberations of the col|lege of phy&s;icians, in con&s;equence of &s;ome of its members having ob&s;erved their good effects when the di&s;ea&s;e fir&s;t appeared, and was mi&s;ta|ken for a <HI>higher grade</HI> of the bilious remittent fever of the autumnal &s;ea&s;on. In&s;tead of at|tending to &s;y&s;tematic arrangement in the fol|lowing little production, he has contented him|&s;elf with enumerating &s;ymptoms and circum|&s;tances as they occurred to him, while enga|ged in practice; and offering his &s;entiments in the order in which they happened to ari&s;e.

By this method he hopes to e&s;cape the imputa|tion of pedantry: and though tho&s;e who pre|fer the &s;tudied and formal arrangement of the &s;chools, to the &s;implicity and order of nature, may condemn his manner, he hopes the mat|ter it contains, and the importance of the &s;ub|ject, will &s;ecure him the approbation of all tho&s;e who prefer utility to formality and fa|&s;hion. To men of ta&s;te indeed, &s;ome apology is due for the imperfections of its &s;tyle and compo&s;ition; but if want of lei&s;ure and fre|quent interruption are ever admitted as an a|pology for a tre&s;pa&s;s of this nature, he is cer|tainly entitled to &s;ome indulgence on the pre|&s;ent occa&s;ion; e&s;pecially as he can a&s;&s;ure them, that truth has been his aim, his end the public good.</P>

<HEAD>A SKETCH OF THE RISE AND PROGRESS OF THE DISEASE.</HEAD>
<P>THE di&s;ea&s;e which we are about to de|&s;cribe, made its fir&s;t appearance in Wa|ter &s;treet between Mulberry and Sa&s;&s;afras &s;treets, the beginning of Augu&s;t 1793, and ap|pears to have been imported by a ve&s;&s;el which arrived in this port, and lay at a wharf in that neighbourhood the latter end of July.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr M. Carey's account of the ri&s;e and progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e, lately publi&s;hed.</NOTE></P>

From this &s;ource it &s;pread gradually by contagion over the greate&s;t part of the city; and was more or le&s;s rapid in its progre&s;s, ac|cording as people had more or le&s;s intercour&s;e with the &s;ick, and according as the weather was more or le&s;s cold: for though it was pro|pagated by contagion, the &s;en&s;ible qualities of the atmo&s;phere had a &s;urpri&s;ing effect in ren|dering the contagion more or le&s;s active, as well as in its influence on the &s;ymptoms of tho&s;e labouring under the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t number confined with the di&s;ea&s;e, was about the middle of October; but as the weather became cold and fro&s;ty, its de|clen&s;ion was &s;o rapid that it appeared as if ex|tingui&s;hed by a mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">acle: for by the tenth of November, there was &s;carcely a per&s;on to be found with it.</P>
<P>The whole number that died of this di&s;ea&s;e in the city, appears from the regi&s;ters of deaths kept by the different religious &s;ocieties, to have
<PB N="3" REF="026837_0009_0FD1E2004A238CF0">
been about 3500. In the regi&s;ters of the deaths which have been kept by tho&s;e &s;ocie|ties, there is no di&s;crimination made between tho&s;e who died of the yellow fever and of o|ther di&s;ea&s;es; and the whole number of deaths appears to have been 4048, from the 1&s;t of Augu&s;t to the 10th of November; of which above <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">00 are &s;uppo&s;ed to have died of other di&s;ea&s;es. At one period there appears to have been more than eight thou&s;and per&s;ons confi|ned by it at the &s;ame time; though at that time near twenty thou&s;and of the inhabitants had retired from the city.</P>
<P>That the long continuance of heat and drought which preceded this di&s;ea&s;e had no &s;hare in its generation, is certain, from its be|ing confined for &s;ome time to that part of the city where it commenced: for almo&s;t every ca&s;e which occurred for the fir&s;t week or two, could be traced to that &s;ource, and was pro|pagated to others in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="026837_0010_0FD1E2055AB77658">
This fever corre&s;ponded in mo&s;t of its lea|ding and characteri&s;tic &s;ymptoms, with the &s;ynochus icteroides occidentalis, or yellow fe|ver of the We&s;t Indies. A fever of the &s;ame kind has prevailed here three times before, viz. in the years 1740, 1747 and 1762.</P>
<P>In the year 1740, it was introduced by means of a trunk of wearing apparel, which had belonged to a gentleman who died of it in Barbadoes. The family to whom the trunk was &s;ent fir&s;t took the di&s;ea&s;e; and from them it &s;pread into the town, and de&s;troyed above two hundred people; as we are informed by the celebrated LIND, in his treati&s;e on fevers and infection.</P>
<P>The only account I have been able to obtain re&s;pecting its appearance in 1747, is what is contained in Mr Lardner's letter, of which the following is a copy.</P>

<P>SINCE my la&s;t, a contagious fever has raged among&s;t us, which admits of no relief, cure, or abatement; never intermitting to the la&s;t moment of life. It has carried off three of my mo&s;t intimate acquaintance; among which are my dear friends Andrew Hamilton and Mr Currie. Philadelphia has been a melan|choly place, and many who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s and fa|mily would permit them, have fled the city. But the air is now become much cooler, and tho&s;e under the di&s;order revive. The &s;ymp|toms (a pain in the head and back, vomiting, &amp;c.) are le&s;s violent, and the fever gradually abates. Me&s;&s;rs. Allen and Turner's family are yet under the di&s;ea&s;e; the one having lo&s;t a near relation, and Mr Allen him&s;elf not out of danger.</P>
<P>September 24th. The yellow fever is &s;till among&s;t us: ye&s;terday was buried young Sa|muel Powell who died of it.</P>
</LETTER>
<P><PB N="6" REF="026837_0012_0FD1E20B279D6F08">
It is a&s;toni&s;hing that the phy&s;icians of that time left nothing on record re&s;pecting &s;o de|&s;tructive a malady. Perhaps if the notes of Doctors Zachary, Graham, Kear&s;ley, and Cad|wallader were in&s;pected, &s;ome important facts might yet be di&s;covered. Dr Griffiths' mo|ther who had the di&s;ea&s;e at that time is &s;till a|live.</P>
<P>The third time of its appearance it was in|troduced (according to the notes of Dr Red|man of this city) about the latter end of Au|gu&s;t, by a mariner from the Havanna: it came to its height about the 25th of September, and from that time gradually declined, and was en|tirely extingui&s;hed by the middle of October. Neither the &s;tate of the weather, nor the num|ber of deaths which occurred at that time, are known, no regi&s;ter having been pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>The fever at that time was circum&s;cribed to Pine or Union &s;treet Northerly, and three or four &s;quares from thence Southerly, and
<PB N="7" REF="026837_0013_0FD1E211EA762DA0">
extended from Water &s;treet, to Third or Fourth &s;treet We&s;terly. Its fir&s;t and greate&s;t ravages were about the New Market, which lay near the &s;ource where the di&s;ea&s;e origi|nated. It &s;pread at that time, as the one we are about to de&s;cribe did, from family to fa|mily, as they happened to have intercour&s;e one with another.</P>
<P>A fever of the &s;ame kind, al&s;o prevailed at Charle&s;ton, South Carolina, in the years 1732, 1739, 1745 and 1748; an account of which has been given by Dr. Lining, and publi&s;hed in the &s;econd Vol. Phy&s;ical and Li|terary E&s;&s;ays of Edinburgh. The di&s;ea&s;e each time that it prevailed in Carolina, was traced to &s;ome per&s;on lately arrived from &s;ome of the We&s;t India I&s;lands.</P>
<P>We are al&s;o informed by Dr Lind, in his treati&s;e on hot climates, that a &s;imilar di&s;ea&s;e occurred in Cadiz, in Spain, the latter end of the &s;ummer of 1764, of which an hundred
<PB N="8" REF="026837_0014_0FD1E213B9CB1310">
per&s;ons &s;ometimes died in a day; that its ra|vages were at that time entirely confined to that city, and that tho&s;e who retired to the country e&s;caped it.</P>
<P>Though the di&s;ea&s;e we are about to de&s;cribe was highly contagious, the influence of the contagion was circum&s;cribed to a narrow &s;phere, for none but tho&s;e who approached near to the &s;ick, or to &s;uch articles as had been in contact with them, or within the &s;phere of their effluvia &s;o as to be impregna|ted thereby were affected.</P>
<P>All that &s;hut them&s;elves up in their hou&s;es, retired into the country, or avoided entering into infected hou&s;es, and all intercour&s;e with the &s;ick, or infected &s;ub&s;tances, or with tho&s;e who vi&s;ited the &s;ick (for the idle curio&s;ity of &s;ervants, particularly of the hired girls, was the means of propagating the di&s;ea&s;e more than any other circum&s;tance), though con|&s;tantly abroad in the open &s;treets, e&s;caped the
<PB N="9" REF="026837_0015_0FD1E21828B96E28">
di&s;ea&s;e without exception. The pri&s;oners in the jail and work hou&s;e&mdash;the pen&s;ioners in the poor hou&s;e, and the patients and attend|ants at the ho&s;pital, from whence all inter|cour&s;e with the infected was excluded, al&s;o entirely e&s;caped the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>There was &s;omething however, in the &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere in the city, or in the con|&s;titutions of the inhabitants, peculiarly fa|vourable to the operation of the contagion, very different from that of the country; for when any per&s;on with the di&s;ea&s;e was remo|ved a few miles into the country, and even died of it, there is &s;carce an in&s;tance of its ha|ving been communicated to any per&s;on in the &s;ame hou&s;e, whereas when any one in a family took it and remained in the city, o|thers, and &s;ometimes the whole of the family, &s;oon after took the di&s;ea&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was al&s;o the ca&s;e the la&s;t time it occurred at Charle&s;ton, as recorded by Dr. Lining&mdash;and al&s;o at Cadiz in 1764, mentioned by Lind.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="026837_0016_0FD1E219643C0FE0">
Tho&s;e expo&s;ed to the contagion generally began to be affected between the third and eighth day; we recollect &s;everal that were certainly attacked on the fifth day, one on the third, and two not till the tenth day after ex|po&s;ure. The&s;e were a&s;certained by &s;uch cir|cum&s;tances, as could not have deceived us. Tho&s;e who had retired into the country, and again returned to the city during the preva|lence of the di&s;ea&s;e, were affected more rea|dily and earlier than others, after &s;uch ex|po&s;ure.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of the mind &s;eems to have had great influence, in ha&s;tening or retarding the effects of the contagion; tho&s;e under the in|fluence of fear, which was the ca&s;e with the majority, were &s;ooner affected after expo&s;ure to the contagion, than tho&s;e who were le&s;s concerned. Every other debilitating power had a &s;imilar affect, &s;uch as an ab&s;temious regimen, too much fatigue, frequent purging, blood-letting, and expo&s;ure to the night air,
<PB N="11" REF="026837_0017_0FD1E22156222B10">
without exerci&s;e &s;ufficient to keep up a vi|gorous circulation. But a lax &s;tate of the bowels, and a moderate tone of the &s;olids, appear to have contributed to render the di&s;|ea&s;e more mild when it did attack tho&s;e who were not greatly under the influence of terror. Neither age nor &s;ex were exempt, not even infants at the brea&s;t&mdash;but tho&s;e that were fat, corpulent and indolent, were mo&s;t &s;u&s;ceptible of the contagion, and &s;uffered accordingly.</P>
<P>While this formidable di&s;ea&s;e was making &s;uch ravages in the city, the country for &s;ome miles around was never more healthy, e&s;pe|cially in dry and elevated &s;ituations. In the low and mar&s;hy grounds, indeed, this was not the ca&s;e; for at Harri&s;burgh on the Su&s;|quehanna, at Dover on the Delaware, and a few other places, bordering on rivers or large creeks, who&s;e channels were almo&s;t exhau&s;t|ed of their waters, by the long continuance of heat and drought, bilious fever, choleras, dy&s;enteries and cholics, were never known to be &s;o prevalent and mortal.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="026837_0018_0FD1E222C7314B18">
The French We&s;t Indians, particularly tho&s;e from St. Domingo, who had taken &s;hel|ter here, from the &s;torms of a &s;anguinary war, almo&s;t to a man e&s;caped the di&s;ea&s;e, though they made no u&s;e of any precaution for the purpo&s;e; while tho&s;e from France were as liable to it as the Philadelphians.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on that the We&s;t Indians were not liable to it, is perhaps owing to the re&s;emblance of the &s;ea&s;on to that of the climate from whence they came; and to the effects produced by the frequent excretions of bile to which they are particularly &s;ubject, rendering the duodenum and biliary ducts in&s;en&s;ible to the poi&s;on. For it is a &s;ingular though a notorious fact, that the di&s;ea&s;e &s;eldom or ever affects any but &s;tran|gers or new comers from a colder or more tem|perate climate, in the We&s;t Indies; as we are informed by almo&s;t all the writers on the &s;ub|ject. But we were &s;trangers or new comers to it to all intents and purpo&s;es, with this diffe|ence, that it was brought to us in&s;tead of our and
<PB N="13" REF="026837_0019_0FD1E227B24DB368">
being taken to it; and for that rea&s;on were &s;ubject to its influence. There are however &s;ome in&s;tances mentioned by Hillary of its be|ing communicated by contagion at Barbadoes, and of a few Creoles being affected by it. But this he &s;ays was very rare, and after the di&s;|ea&s;e had become very malignant.</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The late&s;t writer on this &s;ubject, Dr Jack&s;on, informs us that no negro immediately from the coa&s;t of Africa has been known to be attacked by this di&s;ea&s;e; neither have Creoles that have re&s;ided con&s;tantly in the I&s;lands. Yet Creoles or Africans who have been ab&s;ent a con&s;iderable time, and re&s;i|ded in colder climates, whether in Europe or the higher la|titudes of America, are not by any means exempted from it when they return to the I&s;lands. Europeans, particularly males, &s;uffer from it &s;oon after their arrival in the I&s;lands; but in general, after re&s;iding there a year or two, they are very rarely attacked by it. Nor has it &s;carcely ever been known to attack the &s;ame per&s;on twice, except accidentally, after his return from a different and colder climate. The remitting fever, on the contrary, attacks per&s;ons of all de|&s;criptions, whether natives or foreigners. Nor are tho&s;e who have once had it exempt from its future attack: a fact which proves that there actually exi&s;ts &s;ome e&s;&s;ential difference be|tween the two di&s;ea&s;es; or at lea&s;t it &s;hews, that the revolu|tion of a &s;ea&s;on or two de&s;troys in the con&s;titutions of foreign|ers, a certain aptitude or di&s;po&s;ition for the one di&s;ea&s;e, which it &s;till retains for the other. Perhaps this may be principally owing to the effects produced on the biliary ducts and duo|denum, by the frequent and copious &s;ecretion of bile, to which the inhabitants of Tropical climates are particularly &s;ubject: whereby they are rendered in&s;en&s;ible to the contagi|on of this di&s;ea&s;e.</NOTE>The negroes that were natives of Ameri|ca
<PB N="14" REF="026837_0020_0FD1E2293171F198">
were al&s;o liable to it, though not in the &s;ame proportion as the whites. This was not the ca&s;e, according to the ob&s;ervations of Dr Lining, when it prevailed in Charle&s;ton; for at that time there was not an in&s;tance of any negro being affected by it, though as much expo&s;ed to the contagion as the whites. This with &s;ome exceptions, is al&s;o the ca&s;e with re|&s;pect to the negroes in the We&s;t Indies; tho' Dr. Blane &s;ays he &s;aw a black woman die with all the &s;ymptoms of it at Barbadoes, ha|ving caught it from nur&s;ing &s;ome &s;eamen that were ill of it. The &s;ame author is of opinion, that the di&s;ea&s;e cannot be generated in any
<PB N="15" REF="026837_0021_0FD1E22DAA50C768">
place, unle&s;s the heat has been for &s;ome time above 75 degrees. It is a&s;&s;erted by Dr Li|ning, that tho&s;e who have once had the di&s;|ea&s;e, cannot take it a &s;econd time: but we have &s;een &s;everal in&s;tances of its occurring a &s;econd time here, where the circum&s;tances were &s;o unequivocal, that it could not be fairly a&s;cri|bed to a relap&s;e.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the contagion had reached the central part of the city, the di&s;ea&s;e &s;pread with a&s;toni&s;hing rapidity. In the cour&s;e of Augu&s;t, there were more than 300 funerals; towards the clo&s;e of the month, twenty were buried of a day. During the greate&s;t part of this month, the mercury in the thermometer ran|ged from 80 to 90&deg;, in the afternoons; the &s;ky generally clear, and the winds We&s;terly. From the 25th to the end of the month the weather was cloudy, and a &s;mall quantity of rain fell.</P>
<P>In September, the di&s;ea&s;e increa&s;ed ama|zingly.
<PB N="16" REF="026837_0022_0FD1E22F2CB407E0">
In the cour&s;e of the month, about 1400 citizens were added to the li&s;t of mor|tality; towards its clo&s;e, from 50 to 90 were buried of a day, though the mercury now &s;eldom ro&s;e above 80&deg;. The weather was mo&s;tly fair; a few days were cloudy, but there was no rain. The wind &s;till we&s;terly. Throughout the month the heat was general|ly moderate, and the weather uniform, ex|cept from the 19th to the 23d, when it was unu&s;ually calm, "deprived of the refre&s;hing breeze," during which the mortality was great|er than at any other period in that month.</P>
<P>From this time to the middle of October, the di&s;ea&s;e proceeded with an increa&s;e of mor|tality, owing to the enlargement of the circle of contagion. From the 1&s;t to the 17th, more than 1400 fell victims to the malady&mdash;but from the 17th, to the 1&s;t of November, the bills of mortality le&s;&s;ened rapidly, though not regularly. The whole number of the deaths in this month, amounted to near 2000,
<PB N="17" REF="026837_0023_0FD1E2315FFA9988">

<HEAD>DESCRIPTION OF SYMPTOMS.</HEAD>
<P>THE di&s;ea&s;e (who&s;e &s;ymptoms are now to be delineated), was generally preceded by a &s;light indi&s;po&s;ition, &s;uch as mu&s;cular de|bility, and &s;en&s;e of la&s;&s;itude, on exerci&s;e or motion, drow&s;ine&s;s, &s;light pain and giddine&s;s in the head, pain in the back and loins, defec|tive

appetite, dy&s;peptic &s;ymptoms, &s;uch as flatulent eructations, lo&s;s of appetite, &amp;c. After this prelude, which &s;eldom continued more than 6 or 8 hours, and &s;ometimes with|out any &s;uch prelude at all, a chilly fit, al|ternated with glowing flu&s;hes of heat, came on, generally in the after part of the night, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ore part of the day; which, after a dura|tion, for the mo&s;t part &s;hort, though &s;ome|times of 12 or 14 hours continuance, gave place to tho&s;e &s;ymptoms which de&s;ignate a confirmed fever of the inflammatory type, which increa&s;ed in violence as the day ad|vanced; and continued with little or no vari|ation, till towards morning, when &s;ome alle|viation with re&s;pect to violence was generally ob&s;ervable, but in &s;carcely any in&s;tance was there &s;o much abatement as could be proper|ly called a remi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The pul&s;e, after the feveri&s;h &s;tate became e&s;tabli&s;hed, was generally quick and ten&s;e, and during the exacerbation, it was al&s;o full

<P>The preceding &s;ymptoms which may be con&s;idered as limiting the fir&s;t &s;tage of the di&s;|ea&s;e, continued with more or le&s;s violence from one to three days, and &s;ometimes longer; and then abated &s;uddenly, &s;ucceeded &s;oon after by the appearance of a yellow tinge in the eyes, face, and neck, or by a copious evacuation of bilious matter by &s;tool; and the patient &s;pee|dily recovered, except that his &s;tomach remain|ed weak, and his appetite defective for &s;ome time: or no bilious &s;tools taking place at the time, or &s;oon after the icteroitous appearance became ob&s;ervable, the di&s;ea&s;e proceeded to the &s;econd &s;tage, in which there was a diminution of force in &s;ome of the &s;ymptoms; an increa&s;e in others; and an acce&s;&s;ion of new ones.

The pul&s;e though &s;till quick, was no longer full or ten&s;e; the re&s;piration al&s;o continued quick and hur|ried; and the &s;kin, though le&s;s hot, was more dry and parched, except during the act of vo|miting, and then the moi&s;ture was only par|tial, chiefly about the neck and forehead.

and to&s;&s;ing to and fro became perpe|tual; the eyes and countenance were expre&s;|&s;ive of the deepe&s;t angui&s;h and de&s;pair; and a delirium re&s;embling mania was by no means uncommon. As the&s;e &s;ymptoms became more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, the yellowne&s;s which before was faint and partial, a&s;&s;umed a deep orange or &s;affron colour, and extended it&s;elf over the whole &s;urface of the body; &s;o that the patient re&s;embled one with an ob&s;tinate and invete|rate jaundice. When the&s;e &s;ymptoms had continued with increa&s;ing violence to the end of the &s;econd, or beginning of the third, day, &s;ometimes earlier, and &s;ometimes later, they all &s;uddenly vani&s;hed, and left the patient for a time perfectly ea&s;y and tranquil. But this fa|lacious truce, &s;o flattering to the inexperien|ced, as well as to the patient, was &s;oon &s;ucceed|ed by a different, and though le&s;s acutely pain|ful, more hopele&s;s and de&s;perate train of &s;ymp|toms, which marked the third and la&s;t &s;tage of this dome&s;tic tragedy. The whole &s;urface of the body now became of a cadaverous cold|ne&s;s,

with the pul&s;e &s;low and &s;oft, in &s;ome not exceeding 40 &s;trokes in a minute, but as regu|lar as in health. The re&s;piration was &s;low and deep; and the yellowne&s;s of the eyes and &s;kin appeared of a deep tawny or dull copper-colour; the tongue much cleaner and moi&s;ter than in either of the former &s;tages; the vomit|ing was al&s;o le&s;s frequent, but in a much lar|ger quantity when it did occur; and the pati|ent always had &s;ome re&s;pite after emptying his &s;tomach, till a large quantity of fluid was again accumulated; when it was again &s;pout|ed up in an enormous quantity, and general|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y of a dark colour and turbid con&s;i&s;tence, re|&s;embling coffee-grounds; and when &s;tools oc|curred at this time, they generally had the &s;ame appearance; but &s;ometimes re&s;embled tar or mola&s;&s;es. The patient was generally at this time affected with a kind of cheerful delirium, imagining him&s;elf well: he could &s;eldom be retained in bed, but walked about till exhau&s;t|ed with fatigue. The delirium was generally &s;ucceeded, the day following, or the day after,
<PB N="27" REF="026837_0033_0FD1E24D26D0FB30">
by coma, from which the patient was occa&s;i|onally rou&s;ed by vomiting and unea&s;y dreams; and when rou&s;ed, &s;tarted up, and attempted to get out of bed; and when prevented, immedi|ately &s;unk down again into a &s;tate of &s;lumber|ing in&s;en&s;ibility; and if a&s;ked, when rou|&s;ed from his coma, how he did, his con&s;tant reply was "very well!" As the debility in|crea&s;ed, the face and brea&s;t became &s;potted, as if &s;prinkled with ink; and a deep du&s;ky yel|low and purple colour, re&s;embling blood &s;et|tled in a brui&s;ed part, pervaded the whole &s;ur|face of the body. The re&s;piration now be|came deep and &s;low, frequently interrupted by a &s;obbing kind of &s;ighing and con&s;tant hiccup. The&s;e were &s;ucceeded by dimne&s;s of vi&s;ion&mdash;difficulty of &s;wallowing&mdash;lo&s;s of &s;peech&mdash;rat|tling in the throat&mdash;&s;hort and convul&s;ive breathing&mdash;&s;unk and irregular pul&s;e&mdash;cold &s;weats&mdash;and finally death.</P>
<P>But in more protracted and le&s;s violent ca&s;es, in&s;tead of the black vomiting and co|ma,
<PB N="28" REF="026837_0034_0FD1E24EA447C3F8">
the patient frequently became affected with &s;ymptoms re&s;embling tho&s;e which are commonly met with in a protracted and inve|terate &s;curvy: In the&s;e the countenance ap|peared bloated and livid, as well as yellow, and blood perpetually oozed from different parts of the body; particularly from the no&s;e, gums, and hemorrhoidal ve&s;&s;els. Some had apthae or &s;uperficial ulcerations, in the roof of the mouth, and in the throat, and parts which had been bli&s;tered; and &s;ome had a frequent vomiting, or rather gulping up of dark grumous blood from the fauces and &s;to|mach, or a di&s;charge of it by &s;tool. Several in this &s;ituation, lived many days without any other morbid appearance, except a con&s;tant and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing watchfulne&s;s; &s;itting up or walking about con&s;tantly, but without any appetite or extraordinary thir&s;t, or apparent delirium; till, exhau&s;ted by a &s;udden hemorr|hagic di&s;charge, or by a more gradual drain of blood, they &s;unk in&s;en&s;ibly into the arms of death, without a &s;truggle or a groan.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="026837_0035_0FD1E2542B5F9788">
When the di&s;ea&s;e terminated favourably, it was generally before the fifth day, frequently on the &s;econd or third; and when it termi|nated fatally, it was generally on the fourth, fifth, or &s;ixth day; &s;ometimes earlier and &s;ometimes later; but when the patient &s;urvi|ved the &s;eventh day, without the acce&s;&s;ion of the black vomiting, coma, or &s;corbutic &s;ymp|toms, or great and increa&s;ing debility, the di&s;ea&s;e generally terminated favourably.</P>
<P>This was the mo&s;t u&s;ual appearance and pro|gre&s;s of this formidable and too often fatal di&s;|ea&s;e, through its &s;everal &s;tages.

enumerate. In &s;ome ca&s;es &s;igns of debility in all the functions, and a putre&s;cent tendency in the whole &s;y&s;tem, were apparent at a very early period of the di&s;ea&s;e. In the&s;e ca&s;es the anxiety at the precordia was con&s;tant, the &s;ighing frequent&mdash;the yellowne&s;s of the eyes and &s;kin became con&s;picuous very early&mdash;the exacerbations and remi&s;&s;ions of fever &s;carcely perceptible&mdash;the pul&s;e quick and weak, &s;kin dry and parched, re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s and pervigilium great, vomiting con&s;tant, and on the &s;econd or third day of a black colour&mdash;the &s;tools al&s;o black and gelatinous&mdash;the &s;tomach con&s;tantly affected with a violent cardialgia, or a burn|ing heat, which the mi&s;erable &s;ufferer &s;aid felt as if &s;calded or burnt by a coal of fire; no po&s;ture gave ea&s;e, and whatever was &s;wallow|ed, except very &s;mall draughts of toa&s;t and water, weak barley water, or &s;imple &s;pring water, increa&s;ed the agony to the mo&s;t exqui|&s;ite torture. It was in this form of the di&s;|ea&s;e, that the method publi&s;hed by Dr Kuhn, particularly applied. And it was the form
<PB N="31" REF="026837_0037_0FD1E256E3FF1680">
in which the di&s;ea&s;e mo&s;t frequently appear|ed all the month of Augu&s;t.</P>
<P>In other ca&s;es the generality of the &s;ymp|toms re&s;embled tho&s;e of the autumnal remit|tent, combined with jaundice&mdash;and in &s;ome no yellowne&s;s or black vomiting occurred at all; but in the&s;e the eyes were almo&s;t always highly inflamed for a day or two, but when a diarrhoea, accompanied with a di&s;charge of bile &s;pontaneou&s;ly occurred, or was procured by purgatives or gli&s;ters, the yellowne&s;s or icteroitous appearance was frequently pre|vented.</P>
<P>It was often difficult to di&s;tingui&s;h this di&s;|ea&s;e at the beginning from the influenza, which was prevalent in the city, and &s;pread over all the Southern &s;tates and over the We&s;tern ter|ritory, before the yellow fever had made much progre&s;s in the city. The influence of terror al&s;o occa&s;ioned great variation in its &s;ymp|toms. That the u&s;ual di&s;ea&s;e of the &s;ea&s;on,
<PB N="32" REF="026837_0038_0FD1E25C5BB57D98">
the remitting fever, was often blended with this di&s;ea&s;e, is by no means improbable. For though two epidemics ari&s;ing from a change or alteration in the &s;en&s;ible qualities of the air, or from any invi&s;ible mia&s;ma diffu&s;ed abroad to a con&s;iderable extent in the atmo&s;phere, cannot exi&s;t together, yet there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s nothing more certain than that a contagious di&s;ea&s;e, and a di&s;ea&s;e depending on climate, &s;ea&s;on, and &s;oil, may exi&s;t at the &s;ame time and in the &s;ame place. Of this we have &s;everal exam|ples in the works of Lind, Ru&s;&s;el, &amp;c.</P>
<P>A preternatural di&s;charge of bile, was by no means a common circum&s;tance in any form or at any period of the di&s;ea&s;e, as has been already ob&s;erved. Di&s;&s;ections made not only at Cadiz and the We&s;t Indies, but al&s;o in this city, demon&s;trate that this is owing to an inflammatory affection of the &s;tomach, du|odenum and ductus choledochus: And it is more than probable, that the black matter brought up by vomiting, was the &s;phacelated &s;urface of tho&s;e parts mixed with coagulated
<PB N="33" REF="026837_0039_0FD1E25DD4D42740">
blood, bile, and the contents la&s;t taken into the &s;tomach. The white colour of the &s;tools &s;o common in the beginning of the di&s;ea&s;e, al&s;o indicated an ob&s;truction to the excretion of bile. When the fever was protracted, ac|cumulations of bile frequently took place, as was evident from the ten&s;ion of the right hypochondrium, and the foetid and copious di&s;charges coloured with that fluid, which fre|quently appeared after an active purge.</P>
<P>Dr. Jack&s;on relates that while he re&s;ided in Jamaica, between the years 1774 and 1782, he opened &s;everal per&s;ons who died of this di&s;ea&s;e, and ob&s;erved that the &s;tomach and in|te&s;tines had a dirty yellow appearance, and were highly putrefied, and much di&s;tended with wind&mdash;the liver and &s;pleen generally enlarged in &s;ize, and the colour of the liver often of a deeper yellow than any other part of the abdominal vi&s;cera&mdash;the gall bladder for the mo&s;t part moderately full, and of a thick con&s;i&s;tence and black colour&mdash;the bilia|ry
<PB N="34" REF="026837_0040_0FD1E25F2430C158">
ducts enlarged and filled with a &s;imilar flu|id, while the ve&s;&s;els of the liver bore the marks of uncommon di&s;tention. A dark coloured turbid fluid was always ob&s;ervable in the ca|vity of the &s;tomach, &s;imilar to that u&s;ually thrown up in the la&s;t &s;tage of the illne&s;s; and the villous coat of that organ was al&s;o abraded in various places, and at the &s;ame time, &s;pots were ob&s;erved on different parts of its &s;urface, which appeared to be incipient mortifications. The &s;uperior portions of the inte&s;tinal canal, had al&s;o frequently a &s;imilar appearance. From the&s;e and other di&s;&s;ections, much light has been thrown upon the &s;eat, and nature of this di&s;ea&s;e.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Jack&s;on on the fevers of Jamaica, p. 265.</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>OF THE METHOD OF CURE.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the preceding account of the various forms in which the <HI>&s;ynochus icteroides</HI> appear|ed, the reader will at once perceive, that no one mode of treatment could be with propri|ety pur&s;ued; but that it was requi&s;ite to vary it, as the &s;ymptoms indicated an inflammatory or putrid type, as well as to adju&s;t it to the &s;e|veral &s;tages of the di&s;ea&s;e. But in all ca&s;es which began with inflammatory &s;ymptoms, whether they ended in tho&s;e which indicated putridity or not, the following treatment was found mo&s;t certain and &s;ucce&s;sful.

generally afforded relief in all ca&s;es, when the activity of the arterial &s;y&s;tem was evident; and the head and epiga&s;trium were at the &s;ame time much affected: and this operation was found &s;erviceable when repeated every &s;ix or eight hours, for the fir&s;t twenty-four or thir|ty-&s;ix hours after the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the pa|roxy&s;m; and in every &s;ub&s;equent exacerbation &s;o long as tho&s;e &s;ymptoms continued in any con&s;iderable degree<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The fir&s;t blood drawn in the fever &s;eldom &s;hewed any white glutinous covering or &s;ize, but after the &s;econd bleeding, this appearance was &s;eldom ab&s;ent; though it was never thick or very tough.

with blood-letting, mercurial purges were found more certain in their effects and more &s;erviceable than any other kind; e&s;pecially when exhibited in do&s;es of from &s;ix to twelve grains, and repeated every &s;ix or eight hours till a copious di&s;charge by &s;tool took place; and more e&s;pecially when their opera|tion was promoted by mild laxative enemas, admini&s;tered three or four hours after each do&s;e of the mercurial purge. Tho&s;e who have not had an opportunity of ob&s;erving the good effects of this practice, will perhaps think it a very hazardous one. But when they con&s;ider the difficulty of retaining the &s;aline and le&s;s active purges on the &s;tomach, and the very great difficulty of procuring copious evacua|tions by &s;tool, without which the topical affec|tion which ob&s;tructs the pa&s;&s;age of the bile could not be removed, nor the propen&s;ity to puke relieved; they will change their &s;en|timents; for, notwith&s;tanding the inflamed and irritable &s;tate of tho&s;e parts, calomel in large do&s;es, pa&s;&s;ed the pybones, and occa&s;ion|ed

<P>But, however preconceived theories might influence others, we who were not prejudiced in favour of any particular hypothe&s;is, and who had daily opportunities of &s;eeing its ef|fects, not only in our own practice, but in that of others, are convinced that it was more certain in its operation, and in general as &s;afe as any other.</P>
<P>In a few per&s;ons of delicate or infirm con|&s;titutions, indeed it proved injurious; and particularly when admini&s;tered after the in|flammatory &s;ymptoms had &s;ub&s;ided.

<P>The antiphlogi&s;tic regimen was always found to agree better than that of the vinous or cordial kind; not only while the pul&s;e con|tinued full and active, but when it was low and quick, previous to the acce&s;&s;ion of typhous &s;ymptoms. The patient was accordingly di|rected to drink toa&s;t and water, lemonade, ta|marind-water, barley-water, and any other diluting, mild, &s;edative drink, that was grate|ful to the palate, and re&s;ted ea&s;ie&s;t on the &s;to|mach.</P>

<P>When a repetition of blood-letting during the fir&s;t and &s;econd day of the complaint, did not remove the pain in the head and back, and the di&s;tre&s;s at the &s;tomach, and when every thing was vomited up as &s;oon as taken; re|cour&s;e was immediately had to purging cly|&s;ters, and to the application of epi&s;pa&s;tics to the &s;tomach and legs, or to the back and in|&s;ide of the thighs: the latter method is prefer|ed by Dr Hume of Jamaica, to any other; from a &s;uppo&s;ition, that an inflammation rai|&s;ed on an inferior part, always relieves that

<P>Opium was al&s;o frequently employed in a &s;olid form as directed by Hillary of Barbadoes, with a view of relieving the vomiting; but in general was found to aggravate it. The &s;a|line draught given in the act of efferve&s;cence, or magne&s;ia as already mentioned, had a bet|ter effect, but was by no means certain: nor in fact was any thing el&s;e found to have any permanent effect on this &s;ymptom, except gly|&s;ters, bri&s;k purges, and bli&s;ters. But the&s;e when judiciou&s;ly and early applied &s;eldom failed of affording relief.</P>
<P>Baths of various kinds were occa&s;ionally employed, but &s;eldom with &s;uch manife&s;t ef|fect as to induce us to &s;ay much in their fa|vour, except wa&s;hing the limbs with &s;imple water of tepid warmth, to keep the &s;kin &s;oft, and take off &s;tricture and re&s;i&s;tance from the

&s;urface. When the topical affection of the &s;tomach was relieved, a &s;olution of Rochelle &s;alts, in thin veal or fowl broth, with the ad|dition of a little common marine &s;alt, was in general more certain and le&s;s irritating than any other laxative. (A drachm of this &s;alt requires about two ounces of boiling water to di&s;&s;olve it perfectly.) The inflamed &s;tate of the &s;tomach deterred us from employing eme|tics, or any antimonial preparations: but from the trials of others, we are convinced that they &s;eldom were of &s;ervice, but often the rever&s;e. When purges produced copious, foetid and bi|lious &s;tools early in the di&s;ea&s;e, it generally terminated favourably and &s;peedily.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd &s;tage of this fever, (which however, &s;eldom took place when the reme|dies beforementioned were early and judici|ou&s;ly employed and duly per&s;i&s;ted in), we found a very different treatment proper, from that which was nece&s;&s;ary in the fir&s;t &s;tage; for the inflammatory &s;tate now, for the mo&s;t

part, rapidly verged towards gangrene; and the mu&s;cular weakne&s;s was &s;uch as to render bleeding inadmi&s;&s;ible; and the irritable &s;tate of the &s;tomach precluded all expectation from purgatives, as they were rejected as well as every thing el&s;e the in&s;tant they reached the &s;tomach. Our only re&s;ource, therefore, was in warm anti&s;eptic fomentations, applied by means of flannel cloths to the &s;tomach, thighs, legs and hands, &s;inapi&s;ms to the feet, aroma|tic and e&s;&s;ential oils, or &s;pices &s;tewed in bran|dy to the &s;tomach; or the application of bli&s;|ters, and the frequent exhibition of laxative gli&s;ters; and after a free evacution, the injec|tion of bark decoction, and a few drops of laudanum, with &s;ome farinaceous or mucila|ginous liquor, into the inte&s;tines&mdash;(here per|haps, wa&s;hing the patient's whole body with cold water, and afterwards wrapping it in a blanket wrung out of a hot decoction, and the &s;ub&s;equent application of bli&s;ters, would have been beneficial; but we were afraid to try them). Vinous and cordial drinks as

well as all kinds of aliment, invariably aggra|vated this &s;ymptom, and encrea&s;ed or produ|ced the cardialgia; but &s;mall draughts of cold water generally gave in&s;tant ca&s;e. When by the&s;e means the topical inflammation of the epiga&s;tric region was removed, all the &s;ymp|toms gradually &s;ub&s;ided, and the patient reco|vered. But when the&s;e means failed, and the black vomiting came on, accompanied with coldne&s;s, and a cadaverous appearance of the extremities, and a dark yellow and purple a&s;pect of the countenance, our practice was to employ a &s;trong decoction of peruvian bark&mdash;an infu&s;ion of camomile flowers, and toa&s;t and water lightly acidulated with the elixir of vitriol, and in &s;ome ca&s;es a mixture of brandy and water&mdash;and to direct gli&s;ters com|po&s;ed of a &s;trong decoction of bark, with the addition of fifteen or twenty drops of lauda|num, to be admini&s;tered every two or three hours; applying at the &s;ame time, &s;inapi&s;ms and jugs of hot water, to different parts of the patient's body. We al&s;o directed all the

drinks to be given in a t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">pid &s;tate. Hot &s;pi|ced wine, wine and water, and various other liquors were often tried, but in general with &s;uch bad &s;ucce&s;s, that we cannot recommend them in &s;uch circum&s;tances. Hot brandy toddy, however, with the addition of a large quantity of powdered nutmeg, in conjunction with external heat and acrid &s;timulating ap|plications, often had evident good effects.</P>
<P>When indeed the di&s;ea&s;e began with great pro&s;tration of &s;trength, and other &s;ymptoms which denote a typhous diathe&s;is, we found wine not only &s;afe, but more u&s;eful than any other article. In the&s;e ca&s;es al&s;o, the early u&s;e of the bark in various forms, together with the liberal u&s;e of laudanum and volatile &s;alts were of &s;ervice; but that which was mo&s;t particular|ly &s;o, was the &s;hower-bath of &s;alt-water, ap|plied quite cold three times aday, the patient &s;itting in an arm chair, in a large tub for the purpo&s;e, his head being previou&s;ly &s;haved or covered with a thin bathing cap of oiled cloth.

But after the acce&s;&s;ion of this &s;tage, in which the black vomiting and coldne&s;s of the limbs were the mo&s;t predominant &s;ymptoms, all at|tempts to relieve were generally ineffectual.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The principal aim to be kept in view in this &s;tate of the di&s;ea&s;e, is to recal and &s;upport the determination of the fluids to the &s;urface.

For this purpo&s;e, we are told by Dr Jack&s;on, that he has employed alternately warm and cold bathing with &s;ucce&s;s: he has even wrapped the bo|dy in a blanket, &s;oaked in water, in which a large portion of &s;alt was di&s;&s;olved; or which had been &s;teeped in hot brandy or rum; enjoining at the &s;ame time the liberal u&s;e of wine or any other grateful cordial, to be taken as warm as po&s;&s;i|ble in &s;mall and repeated draughts.

for the removal of bilious accumu|lations, by &s;everal modern authors, particu|larly by Balfour, Blane and Clark.

With re&s;pect to blood-letting, there is much contrariety of &s;entiment among the We&s;t In|dia phy&s;icians; the generality of them re|&s;training the operation to the fir&s;t and &s;econd days, from the commencement of the di&s;ea&s;e, and to a very &s;paring quantity: whereas Dr. Mo&s;ely advi&s;es it without limitation, even ad|deliquium, and a repetition &s;o long as the pul&s;e continues preternaturally quick, and the &s;kin; exhibits much feveri&s;h heat.

<P>THERE is no di&s;ea&s;e on which the influ|ence of climate and &s;ea&s;on is &s;o con&s;picuous as on the yellow fever.</P>
<P>In the i&s;lands and countries within the tro|pics, where the di&s;ea&s;e is generated, the phy&s;i|cians who practice in tho&s;e parts have no idea of its being contagious; but becau&s;e it rarely attacks the natives of that climate, and is con|fined to foreigners from a colder climate, they

a&s;cribe it to the effects of fatigue and heat, ex|po&s;ure to night air, or to &s;ome irregularity, &amp;c. Numerous ob&s;ervations however prove, that it is highly contagious when conveyed to other countries, e&s;pecially in populous cities with clo&s;e built &s;treets, when the heat of the weather is e|qual to, or exceeds that of, tropical climates. For examples of this, the reader is referred to Lind on Hot Climates; to Lining's account of its &s;everal occurrences at Charle&s;ton, publi&s;hed in the 2d volume of the phy&s;ical and Litera|ry E&s;&s;ays of Edinburgh; and to the hi&s;tory of its ri&s;e and progre&s;s as it lately appeared in Philadelphia, publi&s;hed by Mr Carey.

<P>The putrefaction of dead animal matter can, have no &s;hare in generating the di&s;ea&s;e, as it gives out nothing but a little hydrogen or in|flammable air different from vegetable &s;ub|&s;tances in that proce&s;s.</P>
<P>To &s;uppo&s;e with Drs Warren and De&s;portes that the contagion by which the di&s;ea&s;e is pro|duced and propagated, was fir&s;t introduced into the I&s;lands by a crew of &s;ick per&s;ons that arrived there about the year 1730, from Si|am in the Ea&s;t Indies; and that it has been fo&s;tered there ever &s;ince, as the &s;mall pox has been in other countries, would have &s;ome ap|pearance of plau&s;ibility, if like that di&s;ea&s;e it made no di&s;tinction between natives and fo|reigners; and a greater or le&s;s number of the inhabitants were always affected by it: but as that is not the ca&s;e, &s;uch an opinion mu&s;t be

groundle&s;s. For in&s;tead of affecting the na|tives, it is almo&s;t entirely confined to mari|ners from long voyages, and foul and crowded &s;hips; and to &s;oldiers confined in ho&s;pitals, or crowded together in huts or barracks. And when it happens to be conveyed to other coun|tries, its influence is entirely exerted upon the inhabitants of cities; and is ob&s;erved to be mo&s;t contagious in tho&s;e parts where the air is mo&s;t confined and impure&mdash;when the days are very hot and the nights cool. Hence it appears, that in order to give effect to the contagion of this fever, it is nece&s;&s;ary that there &s;hould be a certain con&s;titution of the air, in conjunction with great heat.</P>
<P>Let us therefore enquire into the circum|&s;tances which give this morbific con&s;titution to the atmo&s;phere, that if the contagion &s;hould ever be introduced here again, we may not only e&s;cape its effects by retreating into the country, but if po&s;&s;ible, di&s;arm it of its power, and prevent it from &s;preading, and affecting tho&s;e who remain in the city.</P>

That all contagious di&s;ea&s;es receive their full force from a particular con&s;titution or con|dition of the atmo&s;phere, appears certain, from a multiplicity of concurring ob&s;ervations made by different authors at different periods and in different countries. In what this particular con&s;titution of the atmo&s;phere con&s;i&s;ts, which in one year and in the &s;ame &s;ituation favours the &s;preading of contagion, and in another year in the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on and in the &s;ame place, checks or extingui&s;hes it, has been variou&s;ly explained by different writers: but as no ex|planation hitherto attempted is perfectly &s;atis|factory, we beg leave to offer one which we think le&s;s exceptionable.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See on this &s;ubject particularly the works of Sydenham, Ru&s;&s;el, and Lind.</NOTE></P>
<P>During a long continuance of dry and hot weather, the atmo&s;phere becomes more or le&s;s charged with exhalations from various &s;our|ces, in proportion to the moi&s;ture of the &s;oil, &amp;c. which are more or le&s;s injurious to health,

For it is well known that no contagious di&s;ea&s;e can &s;pread, or become epidemic, on mountains, or on open and exten&s;ive plains, where the &s;oil is dry, cleared, and cultivated; whereas it is with difficulty it can be prevented in populous ci|ties, with clo&s;e built &s;treets and narrow alleys, or in low champaign countries, where venti|lation is ob&s;tructed by &s;urrounding woods.</P>

<P>IT has not been from a want of re|&s;pect to your&s;elf, nor from inattention to the &s;ubject, that your letter of the 30th ult. was not &s;ooner an&s;wered; but the importance of the que&s;tions propo&s;ed, has made it nece&s;&s;ary for us to devote a con&s;iderable portion of time and attention to the &s;ubject, in order to ar|rive at a &s;afe and ju&s;t conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>No in&s;tance has ever occurred of the di&s;|ea&s;e, called the <HI>Yellow Fever,</HI> having been ge|nerated in this city, or in any other part of the United States, as far as we know; but there have been frequent in&s;tances of its ha|ving been imported, not only into this, but
<PB N="84" REF="026837_0090_0FD1E2E9248797D0">
into other parts of North America, and pre|vailing there for a certain period of time; and from the ri&s;e, progre&s;s, and nature of the ma|lignant fever, which began to prevail here a|bout the beginning of la&s;t Augu&s;t, and ex|tended it&s;elf gradually over a great part of the city; we are of opinion that this di&s;ea&s;e was imported into Philadelphia, by &s;ome of the ve&s;&s;els which arrived in the port after the middle of July. This opinion we are fur|ther confirmed in, by the various accounts we have received from unque&s;tionable autho|rities.</P>

<HEAD>TO PURIFY THE CITY FROM LATENT INFECTION,</HEAD>
<P>WE beg leave to recommend, that every hou&s;e, particularly tho&s;e in which there have been any &s;ick, &s;hould be thoroughly clean&s;ed and kept open for &s;ome weeks, &s;o as to ad|mit fre&s;h air through every aperture. The walls &s;hould be white-wa&s;hed, and gun-pow|der burned in all the apartments. The beds
<PB N="85" REF="026837_0091_0FD1E2EB57CA0EB0">
and woollen apparel of the infected, &s;hould either be de&s;troyed or &s;moaked with gun-pow|der in a clo&s;e room, and afterwards expo&s;ed to the open air and rain. Un&s;laked lime &s;hould be thrown down the nece&s;&s;aries; the &s;treets &s;hould al&s;o be kept clean, e&s;pecially in the confined parts of the city.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to your la&s;t que&s;tion, permit us to ob&s;erve, that we tru&s;t the early attention of the legi&s;lature will be directed to the port, with re&s;pect to the officers and other nece&s;&s;a|ry arrangements, and on &s;uch an occa&s;ion the College will ever cheerfully co-operate with them, in their endeavours to prevent the in|troduction of contagious maladies in future.</P>
