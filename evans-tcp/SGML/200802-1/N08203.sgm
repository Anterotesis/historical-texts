A little while after, &s;he &s;aid, <HI>Lord have Mercy upon me?</HI> He did re|&s;tore me one Night, and I hope He will re&s;tore me again. Another time as &s;he &s;at by the Fire, &s;he &s;aid my heart trembles, and bur&s;t out into a Pa&s;&s;ion of Tears.

Then &s;he &s;aid I hope the Lord will keep me from Pride and Vanity; for it is the Lord that mu&s;t keep me from &s;inning again&s;t him; for we can do nothing without Him; then &s;he mentioned that Scripture, <HI>Let the Sinner for&s;ake his Ways; and the unrighteous Man his Tho'ts and

<P><HI>March</HI> the 9th being &s;peaking of Pride by Way of Di&s;cour&s;e, not minding the Child, &s;he took it up &s;aying, we mu&s;t not be Proud, for God has &s;aid, <HI>He re&s;i&s;teth the Proud but giveth Grace to the Humble.

for evermore, Oh! what a Thing it is, that my Sins &s;hould be Pardon'd that are &s;o vile?

<P>In the Evening I a&s;k'd her how &s;he came to a&s;k for &s;uch a Scripture? &s;he &s;aid the Lord bro't it to her Remembrance.
