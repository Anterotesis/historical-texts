</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_WE have very great Rea&s;on, <HI>Sirs,</HI> to give Thanks to <HI>Almighty GOD,</HI> that our civil Liberties, as granted by the <HI>Royal Charter,</HI> are &s;till continued to us:&mdash;And that the <HI>Anniver&s;ary</HI> for the <HI>Election</HI> of his <HI>Ma|je&s;ty's</HI> COUNCIL for this Province is now <HI>revolv'd</HI> upon us:&mdash;Al&s;o, that we are <HI>invited</HI> by our <HI>Honourable Rulers</HI> on this weighty Occa&s;ion, to come up to the <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> of the LORD, and to enquire in his Temple; <HI>That is,</HI> in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner to acknowledge HIM, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> by <HI>Prayer</HI> and Sup|plication with Thank&s;giving: And <HI>then,</HI> by <HI>hearing</HI> what HE has to &s;ay unto us.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="006593_0004_102947DEE98B73C8">
And O, that both <HI>You</HI> and <HI>I</HI> may be, <HI>by Him,</HI> enabled to &s;peak, and hear, as it becometh the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> of CHRIST, and the <HI>Oracles</HI> of GOD!</P>
<P>The Words before us are the Words of <HI>Wi&s;dom,</HI> who is no other but CHRIST, <HI>in whom are hid all the Trea&s;ures of Wi&s;dom and Knowledge.</HI> 'Tis true indeed, by <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> we are &s;ometimes, <HI>in Scripture,</HI> to under&s;tand an <HI>Attribute</HI> of the divine Nature; and &s;ometimes <HI>Religion</HI> is hereby intended: But the <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> &s;poken of, or rather <HI>who &s;peaketh,</HI> in my Text, is no other but the <HI>Second</HI> glorious Sub&s;i&s;tence in the adorable <HI>Trinity:</HI> For, "per&s;onal Qualities and Properties, Affections and Effects are predicated of <HI>this Wi&s;dom,"</HI> as is obvious to any who will con&s;ult the Context, and the &s;ub|&s;equent Chapter. As al&s;o <HI>Chap.</HI> 1. 20,&mdash;23. Where we read, not only of <HI>Wi&s;dom's crying aloud</HI> to Sinners, and <HI>ex|po&s;tulating</HI> with them becau&s;e of their Dilatorine&s;s and Per|ver&s;ene&s;s, and <HI>exhorting</HI> them to turn at his Reproof; but moreover, a <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> is added, that if they would indeed turn unto GOD, then, <HI>I</HI> (&s;ays <HI>Wi&s;dom) will pour out my Spirit unto you, I will make known my Words</HI> (i. e.) more clearly and effectually, <HI>unto you.</HI>&mdash;Which promi&s;e of pouring out <HI>his Spirit,</HI> &amp;c. &s;ufficiently evinces the <HI>Per&s;onality</HI> of <HI>this Wi&s;|dom&punc;</HI> Nor <HI>can this Per&s;on</HI> rea&s;onably be tho't to be any other but the SON of GOD.</P>
<P>'Tis HE, I &s;ay, who tells us, as in the Text, <HI>by me Kings reign, and Princes decree Ju&s;tice,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Here we may take Notice of <HI>Three</HI> Things;</P>
<P N="1">1. That the Words not only have re&s;pect to the <HI>King,</HI> who is &s;upreme; but al&s;o to <HI>others</HI> who bear Rule under him; including, doubtle&s;s, the <HI>various Degrees</HI> and Orders of Men concern'd in the <HI>Civil</HI> Government, of what particular Title or Denomination &s;oever; for, both the <HI>Legi&s;lative</HI> and the <HI>Executive</HI> Powers are here &s;pecify'd; Judges as well as Kings.&mdash;Yea, and the Words do mo&s;t probably refer al&s;o to the <HI>various Forms</HI> of civil Government which are in the World; for the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">anner</HI> of Expre&s;&s;ion is applicable to <HI>each</HI> of them.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="3" REF="006593_0005_102947E1B6AB4CE0">
2. 'Tis plainly hinted to us, <HI>when</HI> the civil Powers may be &s;aid to <HI>Rule well, viz.</HI> when they <HI>decree Ju&s;tice,</HI> that is, ju&s;t and good <HI>Laws</HI> (the <HI>Ab&s;tract</HI> being put for the <HI>Con|crete</HI>) and not only Decree, but al&s;o <HI>Execute</HI> the &s;ame: For otherwi&s;e, the Decrees wou'd be quite vain and in&s;ignificant. Kings and others in &s;ubordination to them are not exalted, meerly, that &s;o they might be in a State of Superiority over their Fellow-Men: No, they are to Rule; but then their manner of Rule mu&s;t be <HI>&s;uited</HI> to the <HI>Ends</HI> of civil Society, and for the promoting of the public Good; which nece&s;&s;arily implys the <HI>Executing</HI> as well as the Decreeing of Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P N="3">3. and <HI>la&s;tly;</HI> We are expre&s;sly told, <HI>by whom</HI> it is that Kings reign, and Princes decree Ju&s;tice.&mdash;<HI>By Me,</HI> &s;ays the <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> of GOD, or the <HI>Son</HI> of GOD. <HI>Q. D.</HI> They derive their Authority <HI>from Me:</HI> And moreover, <HI>by Me,</HI> are they quickned and enabled, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> to Decree; and <HI>then,</HI> to Execute ju&s;t and good Laws; and thereby to an&s;wer the great End of their exalted Station.</P>
<P>Some read it, <HI>For</HI> me; others, <HI>In</HI> me, Kings reign&mdash;But I &s;hall con&s;ider the Text according to our Tran&s;lation, which is the &s;ame with the <HI>Marginal</HI> reading.</P>
<P>So that, from the Words we may note this</P>
<P><LABEL>DOCTRINE.</LABEL>
That it is <HI>from</HI> the LORD JESUS CHRIST that Kings and all other civil Rulers do <HI>derive</HI> their Authority: And it is by <HI>Him</HI> al&s;o, that they do <HI>exerci&s;e</HI> the &s;ame <HI>in a due manner.</HI></P>
<P>This may be &s;poken to under <HI>two</HI> Propo&s;itions.</P>
<P N="1">1. That Kings and all other civil Rulers <HI>derive</HI> their Au|thority <HI>from</HI> CHRIST. And 2. It is <HI>by him</HI> al&s;o, that they <HI>exerci&s;e</HI> the &s;ame <HI>in a due manner.</HI></P>
<P>PROP. I. That Kings and all other civil Rulers do <HI>derive</HI> their Power and Authority <HI>from</HI> CHRIST.</P>
<P><HI>By Me,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Wi&s;dom, Kings reign</HI>&mdash;: And <HI>By Me, Princes rule, and Nobles, even all the Judges of the Earth.</HI></P>
<P>This I &s;hall, 1. In a more <HI>general</HI> Way (in &s;ome mea&s;ure) evince the Truth of. And then, 2. For further Illu&s;tration,
<PB N="4" REF="006593_0006_102947E354FB3358">
&s;hall mention <HI>in what Re&s;pects,</HI> civil Rulers may be &s;aid to derive their Authority from CHRIST.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t;</HI> I am, in a more <HI>general</HI> Way (in &s;ome mea&s;ure) to evince the Truth of this Propo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Here then let it be con&s;idered.</P>
<P>That <HI>all Power both in Heaven and on Earth is given un|to</HI> CHRIST. True indeed; as he is GOD co-e&s;&s;ential, and co-eternal with the <HI>Father,</HI> &s;o, he is <HI>equal</HI> with him in Power and Glory: But as God-Man and <HI>Mediator,</HI> &s;o all Power was <HI>given</HI> to him. This Doctrine was known and receiv'd under the <HI>old Te&s;tament;</HI> for it was not only Decreed, that the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> &s;hou'd have the Kingdom, but al&s;o this Decree was <HI>publi&s;hed. P&s;al.</HI> 2. 6,&mdash;9. and <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 45. 6, 7. and to the &s;ame Purport, in many other Scriptures of the <HI>old Te&s;tament.</HI>&mdash;And agreeable hereto, our LORD JESUS <HI>him&s;elf</HI> told his Di&s;ciples, as in Mat. 28. 18. <HI>All Power is given unto me in Heaven and in Earth.</HI> And John 5. 22. <HI>The Father judgeth no Man, but hath committed all Judgment unto the Son:</HI>&mdash;And this &s;ame Doctrine was afterwards taught by his <HI>Apo&s;tles;</HI> Thus <HI>Peter</HI> &s;aid, that JESUS CHRIST <HI>was</HI> LORD <HI>of all.</HI> Acts 10. 36. And the <HI>Apo&s;tle Paul</HI> &s;ays, as in Phil. 2. 9. 10, 11. GOD <HI>hath highly exalted him,&mdash;that at the Name of</HI> JESUS, <HI>every Knee &s;hould bow,&mdash;and and that every Tongue &s;hould confe&s;s, that</HI> JESUS CHRIST <HI>is</HI> LORD. And in Eph. 1. 20, 21, 22. <HI>And &s;et him at his own right Hand&mdash;far above all Principality and Power&mdash;in this World, and that which is to come. And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the Head over all things to the Church.</HI> i. e. for the Benefit of the &s;ame.</P>
<P>SO that, 'tis evident, that our LORD JESUS CHRIST is the &s;ole univer&s;al <HI>Monarch;</HI> and <HI>that</HI> by <HI>Donation</HI> and <HI>Unction</HI> from the <HI>Father.</HI> He ruleth not only in the Kingdom of Grace, but al&s;o in that of <HI>Providence:</HI> And may therefore very fitly &s;ay, as in my Text, <HI>By me Kings reign,</HI> &amp;c. And &s;o I proceed to &s;ay,</P>
<P>That our LORD JESUS CHRIST does <HI>actually exerci&s;e</HI> this his Kingly Power and Authority. He does not &s;it in Hea|ven, meerly, as a <HI>Spectator,</HI> or, only to behold the Things which are done here, upon the Earth, No; but he <HI>actually</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="006593_0007_102947E54E8CC6F8">
orders and over-rules according to his own good Will and Plea&s;ure, and yet, always in Wi&s;dom and Righteou&s;ne&s;s.&mdash;This is <HI>that Judge of all the Earth</HI> (&s;poken of in Gen. 18. 25.) <HI>who can doe no other but right. The Sceptre of his Kingdom is a right Sceptre.</HI>&mdash;And he is <HI>Wi&s;e</HI> as well as Righteous in all his Admini&s;trations, and is fitly &s;tiled <HI>Wi&s;dom,</HI> as in my <HI>Text.</HI></P>
<P>Certainly, all &s;uch are gro&s;sly mi&s;taken who imagine, either, that it is <HI>beneath the</HI> LORD JESUS, now, in his State of Exaltation, to regard Men and Things here below: Or, that it is too great a <HI>Burden</HI> for him to in&s;pect and govern in all Affairs: For, <HI>He by whom all things were made,</HI> does not think it <HI>beneath</HI> him to govern the World: Nor is the Go|vernment of the &s;ame, in any mea&s;ure <HI>tedious</HI> to him, who, <HI>as GOD,</HI> is pre&s;ent in all Places, and is al&s;o infinite in Power, and in all other divine Perfections:&mdash;As in making the World, <HI>He &s;pake and it was done, he commanded and it &s;tood fa&s;t;</HI> even &s;o, by a Word's &s;peaking, he can, now, put quite another Face upon Things, and make all the Commo|tions which are on the Earth, to &s;erve his own Purpo&s;e and Glory: Yea, and he <HI>actually</HI> does &s;o, from time to time; for he <HI>cau&s;eth the Wrath of Man to prai&s;e him, and the remain|der of Wrath he re&s;trains.</HI> P&s;al 76. 10.&mdash;'Tis not only a truth that the Kingdom is CHRIST's, but moreover, he <HI>really</HI> pre&s;ides <HI>as Governour among the Nations.</HI> P&s;al. 22. 28. He not only has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he Honour to &s;u&s;tain the Title and Character, but al&s;o <HI>acts</HI> the part, and <HI>does</HI> the Bu&s;ine&s;s of an Univer&s;al Monarch.&mdash;And it was with this View, <HI>Namely,</HI> to en|courage and embolden his <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> to proceed in their Mi|ni&s;try, notwith&s;tanding all Oppo&s;itions, that he informed them, before his A&s;cen&s;ion into Heaven, that <HI>all Power was given unto him.</HI></P>
<P>But then,</P>
<P>Our LORD JESUS CHRIST does not ordinarily exerci&s;e his Power and Authority over Men, <HI>immediately,</HI> or by him|&s;elf <HI>only:</HI> Nay, but for the mo&s;t part, he employs and im|proves <HI>&s;ome,</HI> by whom he ruleth over <HI>others</HI> of 'em.&mdash;True indeed; he &s;ometimes executeth Judgment on his Enemies <HI>without the hand of Man?</HI> and this he does to make his
<PB N="6" REF="006593_0008_102947E851D264A8">
Power known, and to proclaim his Holine&s;s, as al&s;o to con|vince People of an over-ruling Providence, and that all around may hear, and be afraid to doe the like Wickedne&s;s. P&s;al. 9. 16. <HI>The</HI> LORD <HI>is known by the Judgment which he executeth; the Wicked is &s;nared in the Work of his own Hands.</HI>&mdash;'Tis al&s;o true, that our LORD JESUS does &s;ome|times, in a very <HI>&s;ignal</HI> manner, protect and defend his fa|vourite Servants and People; <HI>viz.</HI> When he ob&s;erves that otherwi&s;e, they, together with his own Cau&s;e and Intere&s;t, will &s;uffer great Wrong: And from hence, many have been induc'd to acknowledge (as in P&s;al. 58. <HI>ult) Verily there is a Reward for the Righteous; verily he is a GOD that judgeth in the Earth.</HI></P>
<P>But yet, I &s;ay, that the LORD JESUS does ordinarily ex|erci&s;e his Authority over Men, by &s;ome of their own Species: For 'tis obvious to all of us, that &s;ome Men do actually bear Rule over others: And 'tis al&s;o evident from my Text, and from many others (which I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to mention) that civil Rulers have and receive their Authority from CHRIST: They rule by and under him.</P>
<P>And <HI>this</HI> is to be <HI>further</HI> illu&s;trated and confirmed,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly;</HI> By &s;hewing <HI>in what Re&s;pects</HI> Kings and other civil Rulers may be &s;aid to derive their Power and Authority <HI>from</HI> CHRIST.</P>
<P>Here then,</P>
<P>In the 1<HI>&s;t</HI> place; Let it be remarked, that civil Govern|ment it &s;elf is <HI>an In&s;titution of</HI> CHRIST. 'Tis not barely a Permi&s;&s;ion of Providence, no, but an Appointment of Hea|ven: The Di&s;tinction of Rulers and Ruled is not the Contri|vance of crafty and ambitious Men, no, but of divine Ordi|nation.</P>
<P>But then, to prevent a mi&s;take; let it be here ob&s;erved, that I am <HI>not</HI> now &s;peaking of <HI>any particular Form</HI> of Go|vernment; for it does not appear, that any one Form or Species of civil Government is e&s;tabli&s;hed by CHRIST: Nay, but this Matter &s;eems to be left to the <HI>Genius</HI> and <HI>Prudence</HI> of each Nation and Language: And accordingly, 'tis ea&s;y to ob&s;erve, that one Manner and Form of Government ob|dains in one Nation and Country; and another in another;
<PB N="7" REF="006593_0009_102947EB7953ACA8">
and a third is different from both; and a fourth differs from all three.</P>
<P>But what I a&s;&s;ert is, that CHRIST has appointed that there &s;hall be civil Government in &s;ome Form or other: 'Tis of divine Original, from Heaven and not of Men, that there be Rulers over Men, and that they be taken from among Men.&mdash;The <HI>Gentiles</HI> had their Kings; yea, and a Principle of Self-pre&s;ervation, which is a Branch of the Law of Nature, led them hereunto; and this Law of Nature is no other but the <HI>Law of GOD.</HI>&mdash;But then, the <HI>Examples</HI> and <HI>Precepts</HI> relating hereto, which are upon Record in the holy Scriptures, do render this Article inconte&s;tible.&mdash;For, it was the <HI>Angel</HI> of the <HI>Cov'nant,</HI> or, the <HI>Son of GOD,</HI> who long before his Incarnation, appeared unto <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> in a <HI>Flame of Fire out of the mid&s;t of a Bu&s;h,</HI> and appointed him to lead his People out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and to be <HI>King</HI> in <HI>Je&s;hurun.</HI>&mdash;And <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> had the honour a&s;&s;ign'd to him, <HI>by the &s;ame</HI> divine Per&s;on, of leading the &s;everal Tribes into <HI>Canaan,</HI> and of making Room for them there.&mdash;After him, &s;everal <HI>Judges</HI> being au|thorized from Heaven, pre&s;ided over <HI>I&s;rael</HI> &s;ucce&s;&s;ively.&mdash;And then, there was a Succe&s;&s;ion of <HI>Kings,</HI> and that by the expre&s;s Direction and Appointment of the <HI>mo&s;t High.</HI>&mdash;I might have ob&s;erv'd al&s;o, that even before the Death of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> it was the Plea&s;ure of the LORD <HI>of Ho&s;ts,</HI> that there &s;hould be not only a Commander in Chief, but al&s;o Rulers under him, viz. <HI>Rulers of thou&s;ands,&mdash;of hundreds&mdash;of fifties, and&mdash;of tens.</HI> Yea, while <HI>I&s;rael</HI> was in the Wilderne&s;s, a National Council was appointed, con&s;i&s;ting of <HI>&s;eventy Elders,</HI> and call'd the grand <HI>Sanhedrim.</HI>&mdash;By which it appears, that altho' the <HI>Jews</HI> were (for a &s;ea&s;on) more directly and im|mediately than any other People, under the divine Govern|ment (and therefore their Government is call'd a <HI>Theocracy</HI>) yet, it was the Will of GOD, that they &s;hou'd <HI>even then,</HI> be under the Government of <HI>Men al&s;o,</HI> like them&s;elves, and of their own Nation.</P>
<P>And when our LORD appear'd in the Fle&s;h, he was &s;o far from di&s;claiming civil Government, that, by what he <HI>&s;aid</HI> and <HI>did,</HI> he confirm'd and e&s;tabli&s;h'd it; for, he exhorted the People <HI>to pay Tribute to Cae&s;ar;</HI> nor did he refu&s;e to do the &s;ame <HI>him&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="006593_0010_102947EE6F1E2DF8">
And agreable hereto, the holy and in&s;pir'd <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> taught the &s;ame Doctrine, and have &s;trictly enjoyn'd <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> to be in Subjection to the civil Authority, namely, <HI>as an Ordi|nance of GOD.</HI> Rom. 13. <HI>begin:</HI> 1 Pet. 2. 13, 14.</P>
<P>And indeed; <HI>this</HI> divine In&s;titution is an un&s;peakable Fa|vour to Mankind: Alas! what wou'd Men do, if they had no Rulers to controul them, but even like the Fi&s;hes in the Sea, or, as the wild Bea&s;ts in the De&s;art, the greater devour the le&s;s?</P>
<P>And now, I &s;ay, &s;eeing civil Government is an In&s;titution of our LORD <HI>Redeemer,</HI> therefore Kings and all &s;ubordinate Rulers, do, <HI>in this re&s;pect,</HI> derive their Authority <HI>from him.</HI></P>
<P>But then, be&s;ides this,</P>
<P N="2">2. Kings and other civil Rulers are, <HI>Them&s;elves,</HI> of our LORD's appointing and advancing. Some Kingdoms, indeed, are <HI>Hereditary</HI> and others <HI>Elective;</HI> but however, <HI>the Powers that be, are ordained of GOD.</HI> (Rom. 13. 1.) Here the A|po&s;tle by a <HI>Metonimy</HI> of the <HI>Adjunct</HI> for the <HI>Subject,</HI> puts the <HI>Power</HI> for the <HI>Per&s;on,</HI> in whom it is lodg'd. And "if the <HI>Power</HI> it&s;elf be of GOD's ordaining, &s;o likewi&s;e are the <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> inve&s;ted with it: For, Power to act always &s;uppo&s;es &s;ome Subject inve&s;ted with that Power, and that in order to the exerting of it."</P>
<P>'Tis evident to all Men, that there are many and different Po&s;ts of Honour and Service in one and the &s;ame Form of Admini&s;tration: Some are in higher, and others in lower Stations.

<P>It implies, that they &s;hould have the &s;everal Qualifications, which are nece&s;&s;ary to &s;it them for Government: And al&s;o denotes, that their Authority ought to be improv'd and ex|ercis'd for promoting the <HI>good</HI> of the <HI>Public:</HI>&mdash;For, it is not the End of the In&s;titution, that &s;ome Men may have the Opportunity, meerly, to &s;erve them&s;elves; No, but that they may be <HI>Benefactors</HI> to the People, or, <HI>Mini&s;ters of</HI> GOD <HI>unto them for good.</HI></P>

<P>But to be more Particular;</P>
<P N="1">1.

<P N="2">2. This Decreeing of Ju&s;tice does al&s;o imply, that in a <HI>mixed</HI> Government, &s;uch as <HI>Our's</HI> is, there ought to be &s;pecial Care taken to pre&s;erve, what may be call'd "a Ballance of Power" For, neither Part of the Legi&s;lature, may with any &s;how, either of Honour or <HI>Ju&s;tice,</HI> invade the Province of the other; Nay, but by &s;o doing, the Political Fabrick it &s;elf mu&s;t &s;oon fall, and thereby Government be at an End.

<P N="4">4.

<P>And I may add; that when any who are appointed to execute the Decrees of Ju&s;tice, are evidently <HI>Delinquent;</HI> or if they &s;hall <HI>exceed the Limits</HI> of their Commi&s;&s;ion, to the detriment of the <HI>Public,</HI> or even of any particular Per&s;on, doubtle&s;s, they ought <HI>(in Terrorem)</HI> to &s;uffer Di&s;grace in proportion to their Offence; as al&s;o, to make good all Damages.&mdash;</P>
<P>But on the other hand; all &s;uch who are not only &s;killful in the Law, but are al&s;o diligent and faithfull in the Di&s;charge of the Tru&s;ts repo&s;ed in them, ought to have the Prai&s;e of it, yea, and a <HI>Reward</HI> for it, <HI>that is,</HI> higher and greater Honours confer'd upon them.&mdash;Their Commi&s;&s;ions &s;hou'd <HI>ri&s;e</HI> with their Accompli&s;hments for, and their Applications to, the &s;ervice of the Public: That &s;o, all around may &s;ee and know, that the <HI>Preference</HI> is given to <HI>&s;uch</HI> as are <HI>faithful in the Land.</HI>&mdash;And truly, <HI>this</HI> wou'd be an excellent means to bring Vertue and Faithfulne&s;s more and more into Repute among all the People.</P>

<P>It was a Law in <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> in order to prevent the giving of fal&s;e Judgment, and it is of <HI>perpetual</HI> Obligation, for it is a Branch of the <HI>Moral</HI> Law, <HI>viz.</HI> (Deut. 16. 18, 19.) <HI>Judges and Offices &s;hall thou make,&mdash;and they &s;hall judge the People with ju&s;t Judgment; thou &s;halt not wre&s;t Judgment; thou &s;halt not re&s;pect Per&s;ons, neither take a Gift, for, a Gift doth blind the Eyes of the Wi&s;e, and pervert the Words of the Righteous.</HI></P>

Spirit, and have at Heart the Weal of the State, much more than the making of any private Gain to them&s;elves.

"They mu&s;t adhere to the Principles of Ju&s;tice, and act by the Rules of Ju&s;tice; mu&s;t labour to do right to all, and beware of doing wrong to any."</P>
<P>But yet, we may <HI>not wholly</HI> exclude <HI>Compa&s;&s;ion</HI> and Cle|mency from the Character of civil Rulers: For truly, the exerci&s;e of this is &s;ometimes a nece&s;&s;ary part of Righteou&s;|ne&s;s, and particularly, in a <HI>King</HI> or his <HI>Repre&s;entative;</HI> for as <HI>the Throne</HI> is &s;aid to be <HI>e&s;tabli&s;h'd by Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Prov. 16. 12.

<P>But then,</P>
<P N="6">6.

Such an one wou'd be a con&s;tant Self-contradiction, and wou'd pro|bably do more hurt than good; and therefore, it is <HI>in&s;i&s;ted upon</HI> in the Oracles of GOD, that Rulers &s;hou'd be Men of Vertue; <HI>Ju&s;t</HI> Men, Men of <HI>Truth,</HI> &amp;c. Here then,</P>
<P>(1. They &s;hou'd be exemplary for <HI>Commutative</HI> Ju&s;tice, and render unto all their dues; yea, &s;tudy to do Ju&s;tice to all, in their Per&s;ons, Goods and good Name.&mdash;'Tis evident, that mo&s;t Men who are cloth'd with Authority, have Bu&s;i|ne&s;s of a <HI>private</HI> (as well as of a public) Nature; Now I &s;ay, it becomes and concerns them (in particular) to deal <HI>ju&s;tly</HI> with all, and thereby to in&s;truct and incite the People to con|duct <HI>hone&s;tly</HI> one towards another: And not by u&s;ing any

<P>And yet, I don't intend, that Rulers may be &s;o exactly and <HI>&s;trictly</HI> ju&s;t <HI>to them&s;elves,</HI> as not to be examples of <HI>Charity:</HI> For truly, the exerci&s;e of <HI>this</HI> Vertue towards proper Objects is an act of <HI>Justice</HI> as well as of Beneficence in all Men, ac|cording to their &s;everal Abilities; and wou'd be <HI>peculiarly</HI> amiable as well as influential in the <HI>Leaders</HI> of a People.&mdash;And indeed, &s;ometimes, the civil Authority, <HI>as &s;uch,</HI> is oblig'd <HI>in Ju&s;tice,</HI> to take Cognizance of the Ca&s;e of one or more Per&s;ons, and to di&s;pence Relief out of the public Stock.</P>
<P>But then, they &s;hould not only be fair and hone&s;t in their Dealings, and true and faithful to their Promi&s;es, as al&s;o kind to &s;uch as are in <HI>Need,</HI> after the Example of <HI>Job,</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Job 29. 11,&mdash;16.</NOTE> who was a Man in Authority; But moreover,</P>

<P>'Tis a ju&s;t Ob&s;ervation, that when <HI>OEconomy, Hone&s;ty</HI> and a <HI>public Spirit</HI> do obtain among a People, then they are in the Road to Pro&s;perity. And doubtle&s;s, Political <HI>Fathers</HI> ought to be <HI>&s;hining Examples</HI> of the &s;ame.</P>

in the <HI>&s;everal</HI> Branches thereof, is highly nece&s;&s;ary in order to <HI>reform</HI> a People: The making of whol&s;om and good Laws, and a due Execution of the &s;ame is indeed a proper means; But yet, if &s;uch who make and execute them, are not ver|tuous <HI>them&s;elves,</HI> then, the People will incline to think, that their Rulers aim at nothing more than to keep them in Awe, and to oblige 'em to &s;upport them in their Vice, as well as their Grandeur: The People will not be per&s;waded, but that they may live as they li&s;t, when they ob&s;erve <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> as they are very apt to do, that it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s the manner of their Superiours, or of many of them, &s;o to do.&mdash;But now, on the other hand, if Rulers are vertuous <HI>them&s;elves,</HI> then, the common People will be led to think, that truly 'tis high Time for them to be &s;o too: yea, and will be, much the rather, <HI>di&s;|po&s;ed</HI> to <HI>endeavour</HI> it, agreeable to that Ob&s;ervation, <HI>Precepts teach,</HI> but <HI>Examples were</HI> Men: But then, there is a pecu|liar <HI>Force</HI> in the Examples of Superiours, and e&s;pecially of <HI>Rulers;</HI> and hence is that Proverbial &s;aying, that <HI>all Men will fellow the King's Example.</HI></P>

And then, be&s;ides this, the <HI>publick Wor&s;hip of GOD</HI> ought to be, in the &s;tated Sea&s;ons for it, willingly and devoutly attended by him: Like that good <HI>King David,</HI> he &s;hou'd <HI>rejoice,</HI> when-ever he is <HI>invited to go up to the Hou&s;e of the</HI> LORD&punc; yea, and when he is there, he &s;hou'd <HI>reverence GOD's Sanctuary.</HI>&mdash;All &s;uch whom GOD has, in his Providence, advanc'd to Places of public Honour and Tru&s;t, are <HI>peculiarly</HI> oblig'd, <HI>viz.</HI> in point of Gratitude to him, and for the &s;ake of &s;etting a good Example before others, as well as for their own per&s;onal Benefit, to do Ho|nour and pay Homage <HI>to him</HI> in the mo&s;t <HI>public</HI> manner: And truly, &s;uch of them who neglect to do this, not only incen&s;e the Wrath of GOD again&s;t them, but al&s;o bring a <HI>Ble|mi&s;h</HI> on their own Character, <HI>as Rulers;</HI> for it is quite <HI>&s;hame|ful,</HI> when any who are thus exalted, and expect, therefore, that their Fellow-Men will be in Subjection unto them, yet, they them&s;elves will not do Homage <HI>to him</HI> who is univer|&s;al Monarch, <HI>the mo&s;t high</HI> GOD, and <HI>the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of Heaven and Earth;</HI> but choo&s;e rather for &s;ome weak (not to &s;ay wicked) Rea&s;on, to be excu&s;ed.</P>
<P>Nor is it eno' that they be Righteous and Religious <HI>before Men;</HI> but moreover, they &s;hould be <HI>Lovers</HI> of <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> becau&s;e of the <HI>Beauty,</HI> as well as for the Benefit of it, and becau&s;e it is a part of the divine Image: As Sin, in all the In&s;tances of it, &s;hou'd be odious to them, becau&s;e of it's <HI>Deformity,</HI> and as it is <HI>the abominable thing which the Soul of GOD hates;</HI> even &s;o, Ju&s;tice or <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> not only in a &s;trict, but al&s;o in a <HI>larger</HI> &s;en&s;e of the Word, <HI>viz.</HI> as it intends <HI>Holine&s;s,</HI> of an univer&s;al Rectitude of all our Actions relating both to GOD and <HI>Man,</HI> &s;hou'd be <HI>their Delight</HI> and <HI>Ambition.</HI></P>
<P><HI>This</HI> is what wou'd add a &s;hining Lu&s;tre to all their other good Qualifications, and wou'd not only cau&s;e them to be reverenc'd by bad Men, but al&s;o render them the delight of good Men, yea, of good Angels, and which is infinitely more, of the good GOD.</P>
<P>I don't &s;ay, that every good Man is qualified to be a Ruler
<PB N="22" REF="006593_0024_10294818F47F5C90">
in the Common-Wealth, but a good Man (<HI>caeteris paribus</HI>) will certainly make the be&s;t Ruler: I mean, one, who, in the Judgment of rational Charity, has a living, holy Principle within him, and &s;o, has the Intere&s;t of CHRIST, as well as the Pro&s;perity of the People at Heart, and bears a <HI>dutiful</HI> Regard to his SAVIOUR's <HI>Authority</HI> in all his Actions.</P>
<P>This is the <HI>good</HI> Man; yea, and he is very often in Scrip|ture, call'd by the Name of the <HI>Righteous</HI> Man: Nor indeed, may we <HI>depend</HI> upon any other, but one of <HI>this</HI> Character, to decree or execute Ju&s;tice, <HI>at all Times,</HI>&mdash;'Tis true, a Man that is de&s;titute <HI>of the Fear of GOD,</HI> and who is a Stranger to vital Piety and to the Power of Godline&s;s, may do &s;ome <HI>very worthy Deeds,</HI> in his Day and Place (as <HI>Tertullus</HI> &s;aid of and to <HI>Felix</HI>) for, Men's Honour and Worldly Intere&s;t will oftentimes incline and prompt them this Way: But what I &s;ay, is, that a Man void of the Fear and Love of GOD, and of Faith in CHRIST, will <HI>not adhere</HI> clo&s;ely and &s;teadily, and at all times, to the Word of Truth and Righteou&s;ne&s;s, but will deviate from the &s;ame when he can &s;erve a turn thereby: And, in a Word, <HI>Self</HI> is at the bottom in &s;uch a Man; and altho' he be indu&s;trious to cloak and hide it, yet, in reality, <HI>this</HI> is what he regards much more than any thing el&s;e in this World, or even in Heaven it &s;elf, for, it is <HI>his Idol;</HI> and therefore, the public is not in &s;afety while in his Hand.</P>
<P>And this may &s;uffice for the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> general Head under the 2 d. PROP. which was to &s;how, what things are <HI>Imply'd</HI> in Rulers decreeing and executing Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>I proceed now, more briefly,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly;</HI> To <HI>Evince</HI> and Prove, that it is <HI>from</HI> CHRIST, that <HI>they &s;o do.</HI></P>
<P>Here then, let us con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="1">1. That <HI>the be&s;t Rules</HI> which Political Rulers have to guide and govern them&s;elves by, both for the enacting and execut|ing <HI>Ju&s;t</HI> and good Laws, are <HI>from</HI> the LORD JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P>'Tis certain, that neither the Legi&s;lative nor the Executive Powers may act <HI>their own</HI> Will and Plea&s;ure; Nay, but his, who authorizes and improves them; and therefore, &s;uch of
<PB N="23" REF="006593_0025_1029481AAAABA908">
them who have the Opportunity for it, are oblig'd to con&s;ult <HI>his</HI> revealed Mind and Will, and to take their Mea&s;ures (chiefly) <HI>from thence,</HI> and not conform to any State or States-Men any further than is con&s;i&s;tent with this divine Rule and Pattern.</P>
<P>And Thanks be to GOD our SAVIOUR, that the Sacred Oracles are at hand; and all of us, Rulers and others, have the Opportunity, not only to read, but al&s;o to hear the &s;ame explain'd and apply'd, and &s;o to learn <HI>what is good, and what the</HI> LORD <HI>our</HI> GOD <HI>requireth of us.</HI>&mdash;And it was en|joyn'd on the <HI>Kings</HI> of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> in particular,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Deut. 17. 18, 19.</NOTE> that they &s;hou'd <HI>have a Copy</HI> of the divine Law, and <HI>read</HI> therein <HI>all the Days of their Life,</HI> that they might <HI>learn to fear the</HI> LORD, and <HI>to keep his Statutes,</HI> and might <HI>not turn a&s;ide,</HI> either <HI>to the right hand or to the left.</HI></P>
<P>And truly, 'tis no le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary <HI>now,</HI> that Kings and even all &s;ubordinate Rulers &s;hou'd con&s;ult the HOLY BIBLE, and the <HI>Moral Law</HI> in particular; for, this is of perpetual Obliga|tion, and accordingly was Ratified by our SAVIOUR, and is enjoyn'd upon us by him, as the Rule of Life;<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Matt. 5. 17,&mdash;20.</NOTE> And this, if rightly under&s;tood, and duly con&s;ider'd, in it's &s;everal Pre|cepts and Branches, wou'd be (in the main) a &s;ufficient Di|rectory for our Conduct, whether we be in private or public Station.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Magi&s;trate is <HI>Cu&s;tos utriu&s;que Tabulae:</HI> He mu&s;t <HI>keep</HI> all the Words of this Law; <HI>that is,</HI> not only be obedient to all the Commandments, and thereby, &s;et a good Example before others (as was before &s;hown,) but al&s;o &s;hou'd <HI>protect</HI> them <HI>from In&s;ult,</HI> and take care that <HI>others &s;ubmit</HI> and <HI>conform to them.</HI></P>
<P>So then, civil Rulers may not think, that the weighty Affairs of State, and much le&s;s their own Bu&s;ine&s;s of a private Nature, will excu&s;e them from reading and hearing the Word of GOD: They ought to be <HI>the Mini&s;ters of GOD unto People for their good;</HI> and therefore, it concerns them to learn yet more thorowly, what is <HI>the good and acceptable and perfect Will of GOD.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="006593_0026_1029481C4450EB60">
And Oh, that Rulers in general, thro'out the Land and Nation, wou'd be plea&s;ed more frequently and devoutly to con&s;ult the <HI>&s;acred Scriptures,</HI> as al&s;o to attend the public <HI>Preaching</HI> of the Word! This would be, not only an Ho|nour to them, but al&s;o a Token for good, both to them&s;elves and to their People; and e&s;pecially, if they wou'd improve it as the <HI>Man of their Coun&s;el:</HI> For, what-ever &s;ome may think of it, yet, here are &s;uch Maxims of Wi&s;dom, and &s;uch Rules of Ju&s;tice and Equity, as are not el&s;ewhere to be found.

<P>And I may proceed to &s;ay, that not only Chri&s;tian Rulers, but <HI>&s;uch</HI> al&s;o who <HI>have</HI> the <HI>Government</HI> over <HI>Heathen</HI> Nati|ons, and even <HI>all the Judges of the Earth,</HI> are beholden to CHRIST for all tho&s;e good Rules and whol&s;ome Laws which obtain among them.&mdash;Several of tho&s;e Nations did <HI>formerly</HI> receive many Principles of Wi&s;dom from the <HI>Jews,</HI> who were then conver&s;ant among them: And doubtle&s;s, many of them, more lately, from the Mouths of <HI>Chri&s;tians:</HI> And all this mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to the kind <HI>Providence</HI> of the <HI>King of Nations.</HI></P>
<P>But then, be&s;ides this, they have the <HI>Light of Nature;</HI> and &s;o have &s;ome &s;ence of Ju&s;tice and Equity, of Honour and Purity, and of Love and Charity: The Light of Nature, not only forbids Murder, Lying, Stealing, Perjury, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but al&s;o teacheth Obedience to Parents, Pity to the mi&s;erable, as al&s;o the <HI>Con&s;ervation</HI> of <HI>public Peace</HI> and <HI>Order;</HI> yea, and it <HI>dictates</HI> to &s;uch who are inqui&s;itive about <HI>that</HI> matter, many <HI>&s;uitable</HI> Methods for that <HI>End:</HI> So that, the <HI>Heathen</HI> are a <HI>Law unto them&s;elves;</HI> and accordingly, their Con&s;ciences do either accu&s;e or excu&s;e them, as they do, or do not, ob&s;erve the &s;ame.&mdash;And now, this Law and Light of Nature, as well as that of Scripture, is <HI>from</HI> the LORD JESUS CHRIST: Unto <HI>him</HI> is Mankind indebted for tho&s;e poor Remains of the divine Image which &s;urvive our primative Apo&s;tacy; For, <HI>this</HI> is <HI>he,</HI> who <HI>lighteth every Man that cometh into the World.</HI> John 1. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">.

As there are different Po&s;ts and Offices in the civil Govern|ment, &s;o, &s;ome Men need more and greater Endowments and Abilities than others: One Station requires a greater degree of Skill, Courage and Re&s;olution than another does.&mdash;And 'tis al&s;o certain that each Man's Qualifications are <HI>from</HI> CHRIST: Thus we are taught in my <HI>Text, By me Kings reign, and Princes decree Ju&s;tice.</HI> And in the preceeding Ver&s;e, <HI>Coun|&s;el is mine, and &s;ound Wi&s;dom; I am Under&s;tanding, I have Strength.</HI> And in Chap. 2. 6. <HI>The</HI> LORD <HI>giveth Wi&s;dom,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

That is,</HI> he was (thereupon) qualified more than before for public Service, and had a Spirit for Government: Being immediately call'd of GOD, he was al&s;o (in &s;ome mea&s;ure) immediately qualify'd for that high Sta|tion.&mdash;Not that we may expect civil Rulers, now, in the&s;e Days, to be furni&s;h'd and prepar'd for public Service, in &s;uch an immediate and extraordinary manner; No, but Choice &s;hould be made of <HI>&s;uch</HI> who appear to be the <HI>be&s;t</HI> qualified for it, and then <HI>Prayer</HI> ought to be made daily by them for them&s;elves, and by others for them, that they may be &s;till more and more &s;o.</P>
<P>Nothing is more ea&s;y to ob&s;erve than that &s;ome Men's <HI>Natural</HI> Parts are much greater and brighter than &s;ome others: And it is the LORD JESUS who makes this differ|ence;&mdash;for, no Man is more capable than <HI>he</HI> makes him to be.&mdash;And the &s;ame is true, when &s;ome Men, by means of Education and clo&s;e Application, <HI>acquire</HI> a greater mea&s;ure of Knowledge and Under&s;tanding than others; for, <HI>this</HI> is owing to the Ble&s;&s;ing of CHRIST on tho&s;e Means: All our Powers both Natural and Acquired come from him. <HI>He giveth Wi&s;dom to the Wi&s;e, and Knowledge to them that know Under&s;tanding.</HI> Dan. 2. 21.&mdash;But then, I &s;hall add, that when a Man has a Principle of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, I mean, a gra|cious and <HI>holy</HI> Principle implanted in him, <HI>this</HI> is a <HI>&s;pecial</HI> Gift of CHRIST, by the Energy of the divine <HI>Spirit.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Wou'd to</HI> GOD, that tho&s;e Words in <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 2. 10, 11, 12. may be very heedfully regarded by Kings, and even by all in &s;ubordinate Authority! <HI>viz.

<P>Wou'd you have good Rulers &s;et up, and continu'd over you?

<P>'Tis readily acknowledg'd by all, that the Safety and Pro&s;|perity of a People does very much depend, under CHRIST, upon their having wi&s;e and good Rulers: Surely then, it concerns People (if they wou'd con&s;ult their own Welfare) to get and keep in good terms <HI>with him, by whom Kings reign, and Princes decree ju&s;tice.

<P N="7">7.

<P>But to proceed;</P>
<P>What I have to &s;ay under this Head is, that civil Rulers ought (in token of People's &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion) to be <HI>Addre&s;s'd</HI> by them in a <HI>Re&s;pectful</HI> manner, agreable to the Stations which they &s;everally &s;u&s;tain.&mdash;Nor is it a <HI>light</HI> Evil to <HI>di&s;obey</HI> their ju&s;t and lawfull Commands<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Rom. 13. 1, 2. 1 Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. 2. 13, 14.</NOTE>&mdash;And they ought to be <HI>honourably Supported</HI> according to their Rank and Character, and that without Grudging.

<HI>for this is good and acceptable in the &s;ight of</HI> GOD <HI>our Saviour: By whom</HI> (as you have heard) <HI>Kings reign, and Princes decree Justice.</HI>&mdash;And not only &s;hou'd the People pray for their Rulers, but as there may be occa&s;ion, &s;hould al&s;o exert them&s;elves in the <HI>Defence,</HI> both of their <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> and <HI>Authority,</HI> when unju&s;tly a&s;&s;aulted; or even, when in danger of being in&s;ulted by any Adver&s;ary, whether foreign, or from among them&s;elves; for, this is <HI>ju&s;t</HI> and right in the &s;ight of GOD and <HI>Man.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8.

<P>As it is <HI>his Prerogative</HI> to exalt them, &s;o likewi&s;e, to <HI>re|move</HI> them: 'Tis he who bringeth low, as well as lifteth up.

<P>We de&s;ire to be very thankfull for all tho&s;e ju&s;t and whole|&s;ome Laws, which have been already Enacted, at one Time and another, by the Government of this Province, for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ing of Vice and Immorality, and for the encouraging of Vertue, Religion and good Literature among us.

<P>And may it be al&s;o your Care, that a pious, learned and orthodox <HI>Mini&s;try</HI> be duely encouraged and &s;upported among us; even, as you wou'd expre&s;s and te&s;tifie a <HI>dutifull</HI> Regard <HI>unto</HI> HIM, who&s;e Emba&s;&s;adors <HI>they</HI> are, and by and under whom <HI>you</HI> rule.</P>
<P>'Tis well known, that our pious Progenitors founded the COLLEGE in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> chiefly with this View, that &s;o, the Churches in the Country might, from time to time, have their Supply from that Fountain: And indeed, neither the civil nor eccle&s;ia&s;tical State can be <HI>pre&s;erved</HI> in a flouri&s;hing Condition without Men of good Learning.</P>
<P>However contemptibly &s;ome ignorant Per&s;ons may have &s;poken concerning Learning, yet 'tis certain, "that Learn|ing and the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try are vitally link'd with Religion: Religion will &s;oon decay without Learning, and even die without a learned and faithful Mini&s;try: And if we lo&s;e our Religion, what have we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ore?

<P>'Tis obvious to all who are acquainted with the Hi&s;tory of the Country, that NEW-ENGLAND was originally Planted, not &s;o much for <HI>Trade</HI> as for <HI>Religion,</HI> (<HI>viz.</HI> with an Eye not only to their own and their Po&s;terity's &s;piritual weal, but al&s;o to the Chri&s;tianizing of the <HI>Heathen;</HI>) And truly, the way for the <HI>former</HI> to flouri&s;h, is to be tender of the <HI>latter:</HI> But if <HI>Religion</HI> be not cheri&s;hed, <HI>Trade</HI> will decay more and more; or, if it &s;hou'd flouri&s;h, it will prove no other but a Cur&s;e to us.</P>
<P>I may not omit to add, that we are very <HI>thankfull</HI> to our honourable Rulers for their Smiles on the <HI>College</HI> hitherto; and do humbly and earne&s;tly <HI>intreat</HI> the <HI>continuance</HI> of the &s;ame:&mdash;As al&s;o that there may be effectual Provi&s;ion (if po&s;&s;ible) that the good Laws concerning <HI>Inferiour Schools</HI>

<P>We are al&s;o <HI>thankfull</HI> to <HI>Heaven</HI> for the good Laws which &s;ome <HI>former</HI> A&s;&s;emblies have enacted for the Encouragement and Support of the <HI>Go&s;pel Mini&s;try</HI> among us, and e&s;pecially for that <HI>Standing</HI> and <HI>Righteous</HI> Law, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>All Contracts and Agreements made, or that &s;hall be made re&s;pecting Mini&s;ters Settlement or Maintenance &s;hall remain good and valid ACCORDING TO THE TRUE INTENT THEREOF, and &s;hall accordingly be pur&s;ued, put in execution and fulfilled.</Q></P>
<P>But alas! has not <HI>this ju&s;t</HI> and <HI>good Law</HI> been too much <HI>di&s;regarded</HI> by many People, for more than <HI>thirty Years</HI> pa&s;t&punc; And i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Ju&s;tice &s;hall be done <HI>for the Time to come,</HI> can <HI>this</HI> in any mea&s;ure, make amends <HI>for pa&s;t</HI> Deficiencies?</P>

<P>Believe me, <HI>Sirs,</HI> I &s;hould very gladly wave it, and not trouble your Honours and this Audience with it, if I cou'd only per&s;wade my &s;elf, that I <HI>may</HI> omit it, and yet be <HI>faith|ful</HI> to GOD and <HI>Man:</HI> But the truth is, I under&s;tand not how I can be &s;aid to be <HI>faithful to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> if I am &s;ilent in this matter; nor <HI>to him,</HI> who in a <HI>med<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">te</HI> way, has call'd me here this Day, to &s;peak in his Name.</P>
<P>Will our <HI>honoured Fathers</HI> therefore be plea&s;ed, if only <HI>in kindne&s;s to the Province,</HI> and yet in the fear of GOD, to con|&s;ider at Lei&s;ure, as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<P>I proceed now, to Addre&s;s my reverend and much e&s;teemed FATHERS and BRETHREN in the MINISTRY.&mdash;As the Ma|gi&s;tracy, &s;o the <HI>Mini&s;try</HI> is an In&s;titution of the LORD JESUS CHRIST: And 'tis <HI>he</HI> who has called us to, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted us in, this good Work; and unto <HI>him</HI> are we indebted for all the <HI>Succe&s;s</HI> which we have had.&mdash;And thanks be to <HI>him,</HI> that not|with&s;tanding the Iniquities and Difficulties of the Times, we continue in his &s;pecial Service unto this Day.&mdash;I humbly tru&s;t, <HI>Brethren,</HI> it has been in faithfulne&s;s to CHRIST, and in love to his Work, and to precious Souls, that we have, for &s;o many Years, endur'd the &s;hock, and not left the People as Sheep without a Shepherd.&mdash;And truly, whether it will be much better, for any term of Time to come, is very uncer|tain: But however, <HI>let us go on</HI> to the end, to &s;erve our LORD and <HI>Ma&s;ter</HI> faithfully, and not li&s;ten to Temptations to de&s;ert, or to be negligent in any part of his Service; and then, we may depend on it, that HE <HI>will not be unju&s;t, to forget our work and labour of Love for his Name's &s;ake,</HI>&mdash;May we, each one, look well to his own Vineyard: And nextly, to the Souls under our immediate Care; be much in Prayer for them, as well as Preach frequently and &s;cripturally to them: And O, that it may plea&s;e GOD to teach both them and us to profit!</P>
<P>Let us, <HI>my dear Brethren,</HI> be tender of <HI>his</HI> Honour, who <HI>has</HI> put &s;o great Honour upon <HI>us,</HI> as to appoint us to be &s;ome of <HI>his</HI> Emba&s;&s;adors to our fellow-men.&mdash;And as we wou'd hope to be &s;till own'd and honour'd by him in our Work, let <HI>Him</HI> be the <HI>principal</HI> Subject of our Preaching: Nor can we treat on one more noble, he being the marrow and &s;cope of the holy Scriptures; I mean the <HI>Doctrines</HI> of CHRIST,

<HI>viz.</HI> of his Per&s;on, Natures, Offices and Benefits:&mdash;And next to the&s;e, let us preach all other the Principles of our holy Religion.</P>
<P>And while we endeavour to pre&s;erve the honour of the divine Sovereignty, we mu&s;t al&s;o encourage the People to be waiting and hoping (in GOD's way) for the powerful Influ|ences of the divine <HI>Spirit,</HI> that they may be effectually turned unto GOD.</P>
<P>Nor may <HI>Moral</HI> Duties be omitted, nay, but mu&s;t be fre|quently preached up, and as Duties requir'd and enjoyn'd <HI>by</HI> GOD our <HI>Saviour.</HI>&mdash;But then, we mu&s;t al&s;o &s;how People the <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of their having a living <HI>holy principle</HI> within them, <HI>in order</HI> to their bringing forth &s;uch fruit as &s;hall be <HI>well-plea&s;ing</HI> to the <HI>holy one of I&s;rael. A corrupt tree cannot bring forth good fruit: Clean&s;e fir&s;t</HI> (&s;ays our <HI>Saviour) that which is within, that the out&s;ide may be clean al&s;o.</HI> Mat. 23. 26.</P>
<P>And I may add, that abundance of good may be done by <HI>Pa&s;toral Vi&s;its</HI> prudently manag'd: And al&s;o by <HI>Catechi&s;ing</HI> the younger Sort.</P>
<P>And I can't forbear to &s;ay, that it becomes us to te&s;tifie again&s;t all <HI>unchri&s;tian Separations;</HI> as al&s;o to beware of coun|tenancing in any mea&s;ure, an <HI>ignorant</HI> and <HI>unlearned Mini&s;try.</HI></P>
<P>And let us continue, <HI>Brethren,</HI> to do <HI>Honour</HI> to our <HI>civil Rulers;</HI> and in our public Prayers and Sermons, and al&s;o by our Example, teach the People to do &s;o too.</P>

<P>And <HI>la&s;tly;</HI></P>
<P>Let me direct my &s;elf to <HI>the Body of the People.</HI></P>
<P>Suffer, I be&s;eech you, the Word of Exhortation, and be intreated to recall to mind, <HI>the main Intention,</HI> on which our Fathers came into this then howling Wilderne&s;s; <HI>Not</HI> on a <HI>Worldly</HI> de&s;ign, no, <HI>but</HI> on the account of <HI>Religion; viz.</HI> that they might (without mole&s;tation) wor&s;hip GOD with that Purity and Simplicity, which <HI>they</HI> look'd upon to be mo&s;t agreable to the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> of CHRIST, and might leave the &s;ame as a Legacy to their Children: And they had an Eye al&s;o to the In&s;truction and Conver&s;ion of the Aboriginal Natives; which <HI>ought &s;till</HI> to be Pro&s;ecuted.</P>
<P>And it is very evident, that GOD remarkably own'd and ble&s;s'd them, increas'd and e&s;tabli&s;h'd them; and thanks be to GOD, we are, at this Day, in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and enjoyment of mo&s;t of their external Privileges.&mdash;But yet alas! the Crown is fallen from our head, in that, now a <HI>Worldly</HI> Spirit threatens to eat out the <HI>Heart</HI> of Religion; yea, to de&s;troy the very <HI>Name</HI> as well as the Power of it.</P>
<P>Indeed, Many Vices &s;eem to abound in the mid&s;t of us, but <HI>this</HI> of <HI>Worldly-mindedne&s;s</HI> is become a <HI>general Malady;</HI> and truly it is of a <HI>fatal</HI> A&s;pect and Tendency; for, hereby <HI>the Word of</HI> GOD <HI>is choak'd</HI> and rendred unfruitful; and hence, People prove to be good for them&s;elves <HI>only;</HI> yea,

and that in &s;o low and vile a Sen&s;e, as to de&s;troy them&s;elves, as well as injure the Public.</P>
<P>The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Le&s;&s;on you have to learn, is, to <HI>Fear</HI> GOD. Wherefore, let <HI>Him,</HI> and not the World, have the <HI>Empire</HI> over you.</P>
<P>The <HI>next</HI> Le&s;&s;on is, to <HI>Honour the King:</HI> And therefore, pray, <HI>continue</HI> to be dutiful and loyal Subjects to our right|ful and gracious SOVEREIGN: Yea, and not to him only, but to all &s;uch al&s;o, who have the <HI>immediate</HI> Rule over us: O beware, <HI>Brethren,</HI> of &s;peaking evil of Dignities, and e&s;pe|cially, when it is apparent, that they exert them&s;elves in our Service. <HI>Some</HI> it &s;eems have been too apt to &s;peak contemp|tibly of our Rulers; having heard, that they have been <HI>&s;ome|times</HI> bro't into &s;uch a <HI>&s;trait,</HI> that <HI>they knew not what to do.</HI> But let me tell <HI>&s;uch</HI> People, that it wou'd better become you, to enquire, whether <HI>you</HI> have not had a hand in provoking <HI>the mo&s;t high,</HI> at &s;ome Sea&s;ons, to &s;catter Darkne&s;s in <HI>their</HI> Paths? The Word of the Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> are very worthy of your Con&s;ideration. Chap. 29. 13, 14. <HI>Wherefore, the Lord &s;aid, fora&s;much as this People draw near me with their Mouth, and with their Lips do honour me, but have removed their Heart far from me,&mdash;therefore, behold I will proceed to do a marvelous work among&s;t this People,&mdash;for the Wi&s;dom of their wi&s;e Men &s;hall peri&s;h, and the Under&s;tanding of their prudent Men &s;hall be hid.</HI>&mdash;And now, enquire, has not <HI>For|mality</HI> in divine Service been exceeding prevalent in the Land? Alas! How greatly has a &s;luggi&s;h, or an heedle&s;s Di&s;po&s;ition been indulg'd in our &s;everal Congregations! And how few, who appear to Wor&s;hip GOD in Spirit and Truth! Yea, and GOD knows, whether there be not many among us, who wou'd &s;eldom if ever attend the public Wor&s;hip, were it not for &s;hame or the fear of Man.</P>
<P>I deny not that our honourable Rulers them&s;elves have their Imperfections, and doubtle&s;s they are &s;en&s;ible of it:&mdash;But what I &s;ay, is, let the People <HI>al&s;o</HI> learn to look at home, and labour to approve your &s;elves unto GOD both in Wor&s;hip and Conver&s;ation, and be much in Prayer for all &s;uch who have the Rule over you.&mdash;And in a Word; if both <HI>they</HI> and <HI>you</HI> &s;hall be <HI>upright before</HI> GOD, then he will guide <HI>them</HI>

by his Coun&s;el, and will make their Path always &s;afe, as well as plain before them.</P>
<P>But then, let me go on to &s;ay, that you ought not only, to honour and pray for our civil Rulers, <HI>in being,</HI> or, <HI>as &s;uch;</HI> but moreover to be very careful what manner of Men you <HI>&s;hall</HI> make choice of <HI>from Year to Year,</HI> to <HI>Repre&s;ent</HI> you at the <HI>Great and General Court:</HI> And omit not to beg of GOD (at the &s;ea&s;on for it) that <HI>He</HI> would lead you into the Choice of the mo&s;t &s;uitable Per&s;ons to take part in the Government over you. <HI>In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he &s;hall direct thy paths.</HI></P>
<P>This, <HI>Brethren,</HI> of which I now &s;peak, is a matter of very great Importance: For, be pleas'd to con&s;ider, that the <HI>Honourable Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives</HI> do make <HI>One Branch</HI> of our Legi&s;lature; and not only &s;o, but moreover, they have it under GOD, very much in their power, by rea&s;on of <HI>their Number,</HI> to determine, with the <HI>Con&s;ent</HI> of the <HI>Captain General,</HI> what particular Gentlemen &s;hall con&s;titute <HI>another Branch</HI> of the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Wherefore, as you tender the <HI>Weal</HI> of the <HI>whole</HI> Province, let every Town be very circum&s;pect in this matter: And as you do, or <HI>ought</HI> to de&s;ire, that your &s;everal Repre&s;entatives would conduct at Court, even <HI>&s;o do ye</HI> in the Choice of them; <HI>viz.</HI> lay a&s;ide all <HI>Sini&s;ter</HI> Views, and don't &s;eek meerly to gra|tifie a Friend, nor let a pro&s;pect of any per&s;onal Intere&s;t de|termine you in this weighty Affair: But choo&s;e ye out wi&s;e Men, and of a public Spirit; true Friends to the Province, and the Privileges thereof, Religious and Academical as well as Civil: But then, (I &s;ay) they mu&s;t be <HI>Wi&s;e</HI> Men, as well as Zealous in their Country's Cau&s;e; becau&s;e Zeal without Prudence will <HI>but hurry</HI> Rulers and their People with them into the depth of Mi&s;ery: Yea, and they &s;hou'd be <HI>Hone&s;t</HI> Men, I mean, &s;uch as have a principle of <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> within them, and have their <HI>Eyes open,</HI> &s;o as to be able to <HI>See</HI> for their <HI>Neighbour</HI> as well as for them&s;elves; and will deny them|&s;elves rather than injure the Public, or even a particular Per&s;on.</P>

<P>It has been matter of Grief, that any who call them&s;elves Friends to Religion, do &s;o contradict and di&s;honour the good Fathers of this Country, and the Founders of our Univer&s;ity (which has prov'd &s;o rich a Ble&s;&s;ing to the Land) as to make light of Learning, and a learned Mini&s;try: For, all &s;uch Per|&s;ons, tho' perhaps they may not, at pre&s;ent, be &s;en&s;ible of it, in&s;tead of cheri&s;hing, are wounding Religion: Their Zeal is not according to Knowledge, nay, but in proportion to their own Ignorance, a blind, mi&s;-guided Zeal: And altho' they acknowledge it not, yet mo&s;t probably, takes its Ri&s;e from <HI>Pride</HI> of Heart, and a Fondne&s;s to be improv'd: And I may truly add, that there is more of the Hand of <HI>Satan</HI> in this matter than many imagine.</P>
<P>But to draw <HI>towards a Clo&s;e;</HI></P>
<P>As it is a true &s;aying, that the be&s;t Con&s;titution cannot with|out a proper Admini&s;tration, make a People happy; &s;o it is likewi&s;e a manife&s;t Truth, that unle&s;s there be a <HI>Concurrence</HI> of the <HI>People</HI> with their Rulers, they cannot be in a flouri&s;h|ing State; for, no People <HI>can</HI> be made <HI>happy without</HI> their own <HI>Con&s;ent:</HI> And therefore let the People of this Province &s;uffer me without Offence, to urge and inculcate upon you,
<PB N="58" REF="006593_0060_102948874EED0B80">
the <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of avoiding the very <HI>appearance</HI> of that &s;hameful and pernicious evil of <HI>Corahi&s;m,</HI> and to intreat and be&s;eech you, chearfully to <HI>&s;ubmit to every Ordinance of Man for the</HI> LORD's <HI>&s;ake;</HI> and in Obedience to <HI>Him,</HI> as al&s;o for your own Benefit.</P>
<P>Yea, <HI>Brethren, What&s;over things are true,&mdash;hone&s;t,&mdash;ju&s;t, pure,&mdash;lovely,&mdash;and of good report; if there be any vertue, and if there be any prai&s;e, think upon,</HI> and be found in the Practice of <HI>tho&s;e things</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Phil. 4. 8.</NOTE>.&mdash;And let all be done in the <HI>Name</HI> of CHRIST, and after a <HI>godly</HI> &s;ort; that &s;o, your Prai&s;e may be, not of <HI>Man</HI> only, but of GOD al&s;o.</P>
<P>And O, let none of us, of what Order or Calling, Age or Language &s;oever, be unmindful of <HI>Him by whom Kings reign, and Princes decree Ju&s;tice;</HI> but let us <HI>Ki&s;s the</HI> SON, and acknowledge <HI>Him</HI> as the LORD our <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Strength&punc;</HI> and &s;ubmit to <HI>Him,</HI> even, in all his Offices, as we wou'd partake in all his Benefits: For, <HI>He is the Way, the Truth and the Life, and no Man commeth to the Father but by him.</HI></P>
<P>And <HI>Finally,</HI></P>
<P>As our Honourable <HI>Rulers</HI> will doubtle&s;s be very <HI>cautious</HI> le&s;t they give any <HI>ju&s;t</HI> Occa&s;ion to any Man to &s;peak evil of them; as al&s;o, will be much in <HI>Prayer</HI> both for them&s;elves and for the People under their Government;</P>
<P>Even &s;o, let us the LORD's <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> bear <HI>them</HI> together with our mo&s;t <HI>Gracious</HI> SOVEREIGN and the <HI>Mini&s;try at Home,</HI> upon our Hearts, in our Addre&s;&s;es to the Throne of Grace; not in public only, but every Day, both in private and &s;ecret.</P>
<P>And let all the <HI>People</HI> both rich and poor, do the like; and in &s;o doing, you will pray for your&s;elves.</P>
<P>And may it plea&s;e GOD, this Day, and every Day, to <HI>hear us in Heaven, his holy dwelling place, and when he heareth, to forgive the Sins of the Land, and do for us, as the matter does or may require!</HI> And more e&s;pecially, to make us to be <HI>an Habitation of Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Mountain of Holine&s;s!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="006593_0061_1029488A07F9ABF8">
And then, We &s;hall not only find favour in the Eyes of the KING and of his <HI>Councellors;</HI> but moreover, GOD will in <HI>all other</HI> re&s;pects al&s;o, cau&s;e his Face to <HI>&s;hine</HI> upon us; yea, He <HI>Him&s;elf</HI> will take delight to <HI>dwell</HI> in the mid&s;t of us: And if <HI>He be</HI> with us and <HI>for us, who can be again&s;t us? Happy is that People who&s;e</HI> GOD <HI>is the</HI> LORD.</P>
<P>O, that <HI>This</HI> GOD, may &s;till be NEW-ENGLAND's GOD! And as <HI>He</HI> was with our Fathers, &s;o may&punc; <HI>He</HI> be with us and with our Children, and Children's Children, even to the late&s;t Generation!</P>
<P>And <HI>let all the People &s;ay,</HI></P>
