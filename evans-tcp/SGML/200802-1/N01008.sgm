<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>GENESIS. XII. 2.</BIBL>
<Q>And I will make of thee a great Nation, and I will Ble&s;s thee, and make thy name great; and thou &s;halt be a Ble&s;&s;ing.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHEN the World was deeply immer&s;t in Idolatry, God was plea&s;ed from his Sovereign plea&s;ure, to call &s;ome out of darkne&s;s into his marvellous light, &s;hedding down upon them the Saving and Regenerating influences of his Spirit, whereby they were enabled willingly to turn from Idols to Serve him, who is the true and living God.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the famous Worthies that the Sacred Hi&s;tory makes men|tion of in the new World, was <HI>Abraham;</HI> who lived about the Twenty fir&s;t Century from the Creation: He by the abundant Grace of God be&s;towed upon him, exceeded all, in tho&s;e two comprehen&s;ive Graces, <HI>viz.</HI> a fixed <HI>Faith,</HI> and a filial <HI>Fear.</HI> In <HI>Faith,</HI> in that he readily be|lieved all Gods Promi&s;es, which &s;eem'd to have in&s;uperable difficul|ties in the way of their accompli&s;hment; <HI>Who again&s;t hope believed in hope, and &s;taggered not at the Promi&s;e of God through unbelief; but was &s;trong in faith, giving Glory unto God,</HI> Rom. 4. 18, 19, 20. Hereupon that hono|rable Title, <HI>the Father of the faithful,</HI> was given unto him.</P>
<P>He had &s;uch an awful fear of God, as that he &s;tuck at nothing in
<PB N="2" REF="001205_0003_0FB133C718654510">
order to a compliance with his revealed Will: as it appears in his ready &s;ubmitting him&s;elf to that Painful Ordinance of Circumci&s;ion; he being then well nigh an hundred years old: in offering up his only begotten Son by <HI>Sarah</HI> as a Sacrifice; which is te&s;tifyed from Heaven by an Angel, <HI>Gen.</HI> 22. 12. And al&s;o in leaving his Native Country, and Kindred, at the Command of God.</P>
<P>This his Country was <HI>Ur</HI> of the <HI>Chaldees,</HI> which lay between tho&s;e two great and noble Rivers <HI>Euphrates</HI> and <HI>Tygris,</HI> therefore called in the Hebrew Tongue, <HI>Aram-Naharajim,</HI> or <HI>Padan-Aram:</HI> and in the <HI>Greek</HI> Tongue, <HI>Me&s;opotamia,</HI> whereabouts was the Garden of <HI>Eden,</HI> or Paradi&s;e; as &s;ome Learned men judge. Though this Country was ble&s;&s;ed with a fertile Soil; when God orders his removal, he pre&s;ent|ly attends his plea&s;ure, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> him&s;elf with his Family and Kindred to <HI>Haran:</HI> and from thence to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">;</HI> which might be about four hundred Miles: His call is &s;et down Ver&s;e the fir&s;t; which was given to him in <HI>Me&s;opotamia;</HI> an account of which we have in <HI>Act.</HI> 7. 2, 3. That this was an Evidence of Faith and Fear, is declared by the Author to the <HI>Hebrews, Chap.</HI> 11. 8.</P>
<P><HI>In tran&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tu,</HI> Two things &s;eem not unworthy of our con&s;ideration; <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That Gods People are &s;ometimes called by Him, to remove from the places of their Nativity, into a Country afar off.</HI> This call of God is not now Immediate, as <HI>Abraham'</HI>s was: but Mediate; namely, when they can|not Live comfortably where they are, and have a plain pro&s;pect of mending them&s;elves in another Land; as in this Chapter, it is related that <HI>Abraham</HI> went down into <HI>Egypt</HI> upon the account of the <HI>Famine</HI> in <HI>Canaan,</HI> without any Immediate Command from God. So <HI>Lot</HI> re|moved him&s;elf from <HI>Abraham;</HI> they not being able, by rea&s;on of the Multitude of their Cattel, to Live Peaceably together. Or when they cannot enjoy the Ordinances of God with Peace and Purity: this Lat|ter was the ca&s;e of our Pious Predece&s;&s;ors, the fir&s;t Planters of this Land: Many of which had fair Accommodations, and very con&s;ide|rable E&s;tates; who yet for the Satisfaction of their Con&s;ciences, ac|counted it far more eligible to turn their backs upon all the good things, in their own Native Country, and expo&s;e them&s;elves and their Families to great hazards, and difficulties, by Sea and Land; than to abide where they were. Surely, it was not to gain great E&s;tates: but for the promotion of Religion, and the advancement of their own and their Po&s;terities Spiritual good, that was in their Eyes; which made them to come from a fruitful Land, into this <HI>Je&s;himon,</HI> and un|cultivated Wilderne&s;s. And God was in a &s;ignal manner pre&s;ent with
<PB N="3" REF="001205_0004_0FB133C8A3B795D0">
them, who obtained their de&s;ired end, in the peaceable enjoyment of Gods Ordinances; and having all of them a&s;cended into tho&s;e glo|rious Regions that are above, have left their Po&s;terity in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the good things of Gods Hou&s;e; which we yet through the bounty of our Merciful God, enjoy without mole&s;tation and rigorous Impo|&s;itions.</P>
<P>Will it not now be an hazardous attempt in any, to introduce that into our Congregations, which is diametrically oppo&s;ite to the great end of our Worthy and Religious Fathers, in their coming over into this Wilderne&s;s? (<HI>v.</HI> 3.) Who did not &s;eparate from the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as denying it to be a true Church; their departure from thence was an orderly Sece&s;&s;ion, having the Countenance and Encourage|ment of the Supreme Authority of our Nation. Therefore they did not de&s;erve to be Stigmatiz'd with that ill title of Schi&s;maticks.</P>
<P>But have we not cau&s;e to bewail the irreligious folly of many that have planted them&s;elves in &s;uch remote corners of this Land, for the &s;ake of Worldly conveniencies, that they might live as Lambs in a large place; &s;o as that they have not been capable of enjoying the Ordi|nances of Chri&s;t, and by that means have &s;eemed to bid defiance, not only to Religion, but to Civility it &s;elf: and &s;uch places thereby have become Nur&s;eries of Ignorance, Prophanene&s;s and Athei&s;m. But hath not God left upon them the marks of his &s;ore di&s;plea&s;ure? whereby many &s;uch places are become ruinous heaps; upon which God hath in Righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;tretched the line of confu&s;ion, and &s;tones of emptine&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another thing ob&s;ervable is: <HI>That complyance with the revealed. Will of God,</HI> is <HI>u&s;ually followed with manifold Ble&s;&s;ings.</HI> The&s;e Words as they &s;tand related and are tack'd to the fir&s;t Ver&s;e, plainly hold forth this Truth: there are none that do any Service for God, but they are rewarded for it. <HI>In keeping thy Commands there is great Reward,</HI> P&s;al. 19. 11. This our Saviour with Solemnity declares, Luk. 18. 29, 30. <HI>Verily, I &s;ay unto you, there is no man, that hath left Hou&s;e or Parents or Brethren, or Wife or Children, for the Kingdom of Gods &s;ake, who &s;hall not receive manifold more in this pre&s;ent time, and in the World to come Life Everla&s;ting.</HI></P>
<P>When men Serve and obey God, though not in a &s;incere manner, yet they have not mi&s;s'd of a reward from God: as <HI>Jehu,</HI> who at the Command of God de&s;troyed the hou&s;e of <HI>Ahab,</HI> and the Wor&s;hip|pers of <HI>Baal,</HI> which he did with re&s;pect to his own Worldly Intere&s;t; yet his Po&s;terity, according to that promi&s;e of God, Sat upon the Throne of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> to the fourth Generation. And <HI>Nebuchadnezz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">r</HI> did
<PB N="4" REF="001205_0005_0FB133CA177D84F0">
Service for God in ruining the proud City of <HI>Tyre,</HI> where little Booty was found that might countervail his great pains and labour: He therefore gave him the rich and opulent Kingdom of <HI>Egypt;</HI> as it is fully expre&s;&s;ed in <HI>Ezek.</HI> 29. 17. <HI>ad finem.</HI> Then &s;urely &s;uch as obey God in an upright manner, they &s;hall not mi&s;s of a full Recompence. If we look back into the Old World we &s;hall find two Per&s;ons that did Eminent Service for God, <HI>viz. Enoch</HI> and <HI>Noah,</HI> who walkt with Him, and trod <HI>Antipodes</HI> to that licentious World, refu&s;ing to run with them in the &s;ame exce&s;s of Riot. Tho&s;e were &s;ignally owned and re|warded; the one was per&s;onally tran&s;lated into Heaven; and the other with his Family pre&s;erved, when by that univer&s;al Deluge, the whole race of Mankind were &s;wept away.</P>
<P>Sometimes God confers Riches upon &s;uch as obey him; as he did upon <HI>Abraham, David,</HI> and many others: and &s;uch as have not much in the World, what little they have, is accompanyed with a Ble&s;&s;ing, and their Spirits are well &s;atisfyed with what they have. Indeed the &s;horte&s;t way to be rich, is not by enlarging our <HI>E&s;tates;</HI> but by con|tracting our <HI>De&s;ires.</HI> Upon &s;uch God be&s;tows <HI>Honour,</HI> as it is promi&s;ed, 1 Sam. 2. 30. <HI>For them that honour me, I will honour.</HI> Prov. 3. 16. <HI>In her left hand are riches and honour.</HI> There is a &s;ilent Dignity in reproached Piety; and a &s;ilent Ignominy, in exalted Iniquity. <HI>Herod feared John knowing that he was a ju&s;t man,</HI> Mark. 6. 20. Such al&s;o have Spiritual plea&s;ures having quietne&s;s and tranquillity of mind; that fear of God that pa&s;&s;eth all under&s;tanding, keeps their hearts: This is a ble&s;&s;ing that far &s;urmounts all Earthly enjoyments. <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Habakkuk</HI> could &s;it and &s;ing, when great troubles were &s;urrounding them. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 17. <HI>Hab.</HI> 3. The&s;e keep a con&s;tant Jubilee in their own bo&s;omes.</P>
<P>In a word Eternal Life will be the i&s;&s;ue, and happy re&s;ult of a right Obeying of God. This the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> expected when about to bid Farewel to the World, 2 Tim. 4. 7, 8. <HI>I have fought a good fight</HI> There|fore there is <HI>laid up for me a Crown of righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Yea, this is promi|&s;ed, <HI>Rev.</HI> 2. 10. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e faithful to the Death, and I will give thee a Crown of Life.</HI> And &s;o Servants, that obey Chri&s;t in their places, <HI>Col.</HI> 3. 24. How &s;hould this excite all Per&s;ons, e&s;pecially Superiours, to Obey the Com|mands of God: they &s;hould be &s;tedfa&s;t, &amp; immoveable in ways of Well-doing, knowing that their labour will not be in vain; for God will not deny his Word; but will give a full accompli&s;hment to his promi&s;es. Godline&s;s hath the promi&s;e of the Life that now is, and that which is to come: as we find it accompli&s;hed unto <HI>Abraham,</HI> according to the promi&s;es that he here makes to him in the words read.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="001205_0006_0FB133CCE7F8F8A0">
Which are compounded of a <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> and a <HI>Precept.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Here is a copious <HI>Promi&s;e.</HI> God having called <HI>Abraham</HI> from his own Country, doth not leave him de&s;titute: He gives him a Country far better than that which he left; which he plainly promi&s;eth, <HI>Gen.</HI> 12. 1. And is nece&s;&s;arily implied in this Promi&s;e of a numerous Po&s;te|rity, or making him a great Nation, as the Stars of Heaven, as the Du&s;t of the Earth, <HI>Gen.</HI> 13. 10. He engageth that he will be&s;tow upon him <HI>Spiritual</HI> Ble&s;&s;ings. <HI>I will ble&s;s thee;</HI> that is <HI>Spiritually.</HI> He farther promi&s;eth to make him a great Name. <HI>Name</HI> in Scripture, hath a dou|ble acceptation; and &s;o it denotes (1.) <HI>Dignity, viz.</HI> Riches, Emi|nency of Parts and Gifts, noblene&s;s of Birth; &s;o it may be taken in <HI>Gen.</HI> 6. 4. They were men of <HI>Renown,</HI> and as the Hebrew hath it, Men of <HI>NAME, Numb.</HI> 16. 2. (2.) <HI>Authority;</HI> So <HI>Name</HI> is frequently ta|ken in Scripture, as in that form u&s;ed in the Admini&s;tration of Bap|ti&s;m, <HI>Phil.</HI> 2. 10. <HI>Acts</HI> 3. 6. &amp; 4. 17. The&s;e two are &s;eparable; Per&s;ons may be Honourable by virtue of their Birth, Breeding, and great E|&s;tate, and yet de&s;titute of Authority: Both the&s;e were be&s;towed on <HI>Abraham,</HI> who was endowed with Riches, both internal and external. He had al&s;o great Authority, who was a Ruler over a va&s;t and nume|rous Family; and the Sons of <HI>Heth</HI> call him Lord, and a very great Prince, which in the <HI>Hebrew</HI> is expre&s;&s;ed by the Name of God, a <HI>Prince of God;</HI> that &s;tands in the room of the &s;uperlative degree. And be &s;ure, his Po&s;terity, many of them, were Rulers and Kings, <HI>Gen.</HI> 17. 6.</P>
<P N="2">2. We have an expre&s;s <HI>Precept; Thou &s;halt be a Ble&s;&s;ing:</HI> Or as it is in the Original, <HI>Be thou a Ble&s;&s;ing:</HI> and &s;o it is rendred by <HI>Junius</HI> and <HI>Tye|melius, E&s;to Benedictioni;</HI> were it in the future ten&s;e as it is tran&s;lated, yet it may be lookt upon as a Command; for not only Negative Com|mands are &s;et down in the future ten&s;e, as in the <HI>Decalogue;</HI> but al&s;o Affirmative, as in <HI>Mal.</HI> 1. 6. where in the Original, it is in the future ten&s;e; <HI>A Son &s;hall honour his Father, Mal.</HI> 2. 7. <HI>Lev.</HI> 19. 2. compared with 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1. 16.</P>
<P><HI>Abraham</HI> was to be a Ble&s;&s;ing, not only in that he was to be the mediate Progenitor of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> in whom all the Nations of the Earth were to be ble&s;&s;ed; but al&s;o he was to be a Ble&s;&s;ing in his <HI>own</HI> per|&s;on, by his U&s;efulne&s;s to others, in the due improvement of the many temporal and &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings that in abundance God had be&s;towed upon him. There is a great difference in being ble&s;&s;ed in a <HI>pa&s;&s;ive,</HI> and being a Ble&s;&s;ing in an <HI>active</HI> &s;en&s;e. Many are <HI>ble&s;&s;ed</HI> with Riches, excellent Gifts and Authority, but are not <HI>Ble&s;&s;ings</HI> in their Places, but the contrary.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="001205_0007_0FB133CED0F629C0">
The words read, with what precedes, may admit of this Paraphra&s;e: <HI>Abraham!</HI> <Q>I have exalted my &s;elf to &s;hew mercy to thee, by giving thee an effectual Call, whereby thou art brought nigh to me; ma|king a remarkable di&s;tinction between thee and many others, in con|ferring upon thee my powerful Spirit, whereby thou art made wil|ling to become a follower of me. And I have bound my &s;elf by ma|ny great and precious Promi&s;es, that I will Crown thee with a nu|merous Po&s;terity, and advance thee to great Dignity and Authority, whereby thou wilt be advantaged with opportunity and ability of Glorifying my Name, and doing good to others: I do therefore expect, and peremptorily require thee, to the utmo&s;t of thy ability to be a rich Ble&s;&s;ing unto all per&s;ons that thou &s;tande&s;t related to.</Q></P>
<P>The words may be re&s;olved into this &s;hort Propo&s;ition, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><LABEL>DOCTRINE.</LABEL>
<HI>That they who are Signally Ble&s;&s;ed by GOD, are to be Ble&s;&s;ings unto Men.</HI></P>
<P>Or, Such as God doth advance to places of Dignity and Authority; they are, in an e&s;pecial manner, by a faithful improvement of them, to promote the Good of others.</P>
<P>There are three A&s;&s;ertions, which may be Prelimenary to what fol|lows; which are plainly legible in the Text; <HI>Viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That GOD is the Author and Giver of every Ble&s;&s;ing.</HI> As it is three times declared in the Words: He is the Father of Mercy; Every good and perfect gift comes down from God, <HI>Jam.</HI> 1. 17. Whatever Mercies are be&s;towed upon us; we are to acknowledge them to be the free and gratuitous gifts of God; the many plea&s;ant &s;treams of Mercy that flow in upon us, and follow us; they come down from Heaven; all our fre&s;h Springs are in God. He gives large mea&s;ures of Wi&s;dom to &s;ome; whereby they are fitted to rule and govern others; and he exalteth men to high Places of Authority, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 75. 6, 7. He &s;ets a Crown upon the heads of &s;ome, ve&s;ting them with Supreme Authority, to whom he gives a Spirit of Government, as he did to <HI>Saul</HI> &amp; <HI>David.</HI> To others he gives power to become Rich, making their Labours &s;ucce&s;sful: Hence we are to acknowledge God in all the Wayes of Mercy wherein he Walks towards us; rendering to him the Tribute of Prai&s;e; both Verbal, and
<PB N="7" REF="001205_0008_0FB133D076FE04A8">
Practical that is due unto Him.

<P N="2">2. <HI>GOD, according to his Sovereign Wi&s;dom,</HI> is plea&s;ed <HI>Variou&s;ly to di&s;tri|bute Ble&s;&s;ings to the Children of Men.</HI> Upon &s;ome he be&s;tows more, both of Internal and External Ble&s;&s;ings, than he doth unto others: He doth not with an equal mea&s;ure di&s;pence his gifts, which will not render God ju&s;tly chargeable with Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, as though he were a Re&s;pecter of Per&s;ons. As God is Judge, with him there is no re|&s;pect of Per&s;ons, <HI>Act.</HI> 10. 36.

Some God advanceth to high places of Dignity and Authority, who&s;e Cups run over with an affluence of many good things, while others are kept in a low, mean and &s;traitened &s;tate, <HI>Prov.</HI> 22. 2. <HI>The Rich and the Poor meet together, and the Lord is the maker of both;</HI> that is, not only of their <HI>Per|&s;ons,</HI> but al&s;o of their <HI>Condition.</HI> Some are aba&s;ed, while others are e|levated: He Crowns one with a Crown of <HI>Thorns,</HI> but another with a Crown of <HI>Gold:</HI> He puts a <HI>Scepter</HI> into the hand of one, and a <HI>Shovel</HI> into the hand of another. We cannot all be Top-branches, as a great Lord of our Nation once &s;aid.

Some ride upon the High Places of the Earth, when others are pa&s;&s;ing through the dark Valley of the Shadow of Death. Thus God dealt with <HI>Abraham,</HI> whom he exalted above many others: This is a plain evidence of Gods Soveraign Wi&s;dom, and it is nece&s;&s;ary for the upholding of Order among&s;t men: Did all &s;tand upon a Level, there could not po&s;&s;ibly be any Order; for Order is, <HI>AEqualium inaequaliumque apta di&s;po&s;itio;</HI> a fit di&s;po&s;ing of equal &amp; ine|qual; as gives to every thing and per&s;on their due and proper place.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings which the Soveraign Hand of God be&s;tows upon men, are to be improved &s;o, as that they may be Ble&s;&s;ings to all &s;uch as they &s;tand related to.</HI> This is here called for and required. Thus did <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Nehe|miah</HI>

In general:</HI> All truly Sanctifyed Ones, as <HI>Abraham</HI> was; who having the Image of God fairly drawn upon them, are made partakers of the Divine Nature: who being called out of the World, do not fa&s;hion them&s;elves to a complyance with the Evil Cu&s;toms &amp; Immoralities that are abounding: but are tran&s;formed in their Minds &s;o as rightly to <HI>Know,</HI> and &s;incerely to <HI>Do</HI> the Holy Will of God: who labour to plea&s;e God, and to walk worthy of his peculiar Grace be&s;towed upon them. The&s;e are Excellent Ones in whom God's Soul takes plea&s;ure; for who&s;e &s;ake the World is upheld: The&s;e are God's <HI>Jewels,</HI> whom he &s;o regards, that as long as they are here in the World, he will not de&s;troy it; but will Exerci&s;e Pa|tience to long Suffering; the&s;e are the <HI>Wheat,</HI> for the &s;ake of which the <HI>Tares</HI> are not pluckt up, and burnt. The&s;e are the <HI>Pillars</HI> of the places where they Live. In a word, they are the <HI>Chariots</HI> and <HI>Hor&s;e|men</HI> that defend the World; who by their Faith and Prayer &s;tand in the Gap, as <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> did, to prevent the irruption and breaking in of Divine Wrath; and keep the gracious pre&s;ence of God with them among&s;t whom they Live: This is intimated to us by the Prophet, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 6. <HI>ult. The holy Seed &s;hall be the &s;ub&s;tance thereof.</HI> The Word rendred <HI>Sub&s;tance,</HI> &s;ignifyes a <HI>Pillar,</HI> which is made u&s;e of to &s;upport the building.

Where there is an allu&s;ion to an Husbandman that e&s;pies &s;ome Grapes, which gives hopes of the recovery of the Vine; he then layes a&s;ide thoughts of cutting it down: So the Saints of God are a Ble&s;&s;ing; for who&s;e &s;ake he will &s;pare a People, and not utterly de&s;troy them. It is often &s;aid, that for <HI>David'</HI>s &s;ake he would continue the Kingdom of <HI>Judah.</HI> And we know, that for <HI>Paul's</HI> &s;ake, near three hundred Souls were Saved, <HI>Act.</HI> 27. 24. Others, that are not truely gracious, being in high Places of Authority, may have their hearts &s;o wrought upon by the powerful Spirit of God, as that they may be U&s;eful and Serviceable. <HI>The Earth helped the Woman,</HI> Rev. 12. 16. that is, (as it is interpreted by &s;ome) great Rulers that had little or no Religion in them; for their own ends were helpful to the Church

of God. So <HI>Cyrus</HI> and <HI>Darius,</HI> were very u&s;eful to the People of God in promoting their return to their own Land, and rebuilding of the Temple. Particularly,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Such as are Religious, who &s;et an high Value and Price upon the Ordi|nances and In&s;titutions of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and are Willing to further and promote them.</HI> Such an one was <HI>Abraham,</HI> who, wherever he came, &s;et up Altars unto God, to Wor&s;hip him, and call upon his Name: The Word which is tran&s;lated <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing,</HI> is a branch that Springs from the Hebrew root in <HI>KAL,</HI> which properly &s;ignifies to bow the Knee; which is that natural Ceremony which is u&s;ed in the Wor&s;hip of God, and is put for Praying to Him, <HI>P&s;a.</HI> 95. 6. by which the Saints obtain ble&s;&s;ings. By this <HI>Abraham</HI> Saved <HI>Let</HI> from tho&s;e &s;corching flames that devoured the Inhabitants of the Plain.</P>
<P>Thus were <HI>Jo&s;iah</HI> and <HI>Nehemiah</HI> Ble&s;&s;ings, who purged the Hou&s;e of God, and took care that the Sabbaths were Sanctifyed, and not pro|phaned. Such as God, in his Wi&s;e Providence, doth advance to places of Authority, they become Ble&s;&s;ings when they make it their principal care to promote and Set Up the Wor&s;hip of God in their Dominions. Now the Power of Magi&s;trates, relating to the Wor&s;hip of God, is of an External nature; which lyes in taking care that duely Qualifyed Per|&s;ons be &s;ent forth, and authorized to Preach the Word, and Admini&s;ter the Seals of the Covenant; that they be able to Feed the People of God with Knowledge and Under&s;tanding. In order thereunto they are to Endeavour that <HI>Schools</HI> and <HI>Colleges</HI> be Erected, whereby Per&s;ons may be furni&s;hed with Learning, and &s;o become <GAP DESC="foreign">, able to Teach: That People attend upon the Publick Wor&s;hip of God: And Suitable Provi&s;ion be made for the faithful Di&s;pen&s;ers of the Go&s;pel, whereby they may be Encouraged in the right di&s;charge of the Work incumbent on them. We &s;hall find in the Sacred Hi&s;tory many In&s;tances of Religious Kings and Rulers, who thus did, and were thereby great Ble&s;&s;ings to their People. For it is evident, that where Religion, according to the Word of God, is &s;et up and countenanced by Magi&s;trates; there the Ble&s;&s;ed God Dwells, and con|ferrs many Ble&s;&s;ings: For wherever God records his Name, there he will come and ble&s;s his People, <HI>Exod.</HI> 20. 24.

And having to do with Equals, in making Bargains and Contracts, which is called Cummutative Ju&s;tice, they endeavour to keep a good Con&s;cience, willing in all things to Live Hone&s;tly; Such are Ble&s;&s;ings, as <HI>Nehemiah</HI> was, who bore a &s;evere Te&s;timony again&s;t the Oppre&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Jews, Chap.</HI> 5. They who con&s;tantly wear the Brea&s;t-plate of Righteou&s;ne&s;s; they honour the Chri&s;tian Religion.

<P N="3">3. <HI>Such as give all diligence to perform their Relative Duties; and do not willingly &s;tep out of their Places, or Omit what is required of them.</HI> Thus <HI>Abraham</HI> was a faithful Ruler over his numerous Family, in&s;tructing them in what did appertain to the honour of God, and their be&s;t good. This is te&s;tifyed of him by God him&s;elf: <HI>Gen.</HI> 8. 19. <HI>I know that he will command his Children, and his Hou&s;hold after him, that they &s;hall keep the way of the Lord, to do ju&s;tice and judgment, that the Lord may bring upon</HI> Abraham <HI>that which he hath &s;poken of him.</HI> Thus was <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> his great-grand-Son, who, as a <HI>Son,</HI> was a ble&s;&s;ing to his Father: as a <HI>Servant,</HI> he was a ble&s;&s;ing to <HI>Potiphar</HI> his Ma&s;ter, <HI>Gen.</HI> 39. 5, 6. <HI>God ble&s;&s;ed the Egyptians hou&s;e for Jo&s;eph'</HI>s <HI>&s;ake;</HI> As a <HI>Pri&s;oner,</HI> he was a ble&s;&s;ing to the Jaylor, <HI>Gen.</HI> 39. <HI>ult.</HI> And after his advancement by <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> as his <HI>Viceroy,</HI> he was a wonderful ble&s;&s;ing to all the Kingdom of <HI>Egypt;</HI> as he was a <HI>Father</HI> to

<HI>Pharaoh,</HI> in &s;eeking his honour, and maintaining his right: So he was a <HI>Father</HI> to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed <HI>Egyptians,</HI> and his own Relations.</P>
<P>GOD, in his All-Wi&s;e Providence, doth fix all Per&s;ons in this or that Relation; and of his conde&s;cending Grace, hath given an expre&s;s ac|count of his Will, how all &s;hould act therein. Now while Per&s;ons, whether Superiours or Inferiours, do act in their Places with Faithfulne&s;s, filling them up with Duty, they are ble&s;&s;ings: and indeed this is needful to evince the truth and reality of their <HI>Piety</HI> towards God, and <HI>Love</HI> towards men. If we be not <HI>Relatively</HI> good, we have rea&s;on to que&s;tion whether we be <HI>Really</HI> good.

There are none &s;o Great Ble&s;&s;ings in their Places as Magi&s;trates and Mini&s;ters, who are careful and con&s;cientious in the due di&s;charge of their Duties. It is to be noted, that the neglect of Duty in one Re|late, will not give a di&s;charge to the Correlate, to omit the doing of his Duty; as it is evident in that of a Ma&s;ter and Servant: Tho' the Servant hath a cruel and crabbed Ma&s;ter; yet he ought to attend the performance of his own proper Duty, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2. 18. <HI>Servants be Sub|ject to your Ma&s;ters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but al&s;o to the froward,</HI> &amp;c.

5. <HI>Such as are of a Publick frame of Spirit, who are &s;tudiou&s;ly careful to do what lies within the compa&s;s of their power, for the furtherance of the good of Others.</HI> Thus was <HI>Abraham,</HI> who with importunity did intercede for the <HI>Sodomites;</HI> who al&s;o did expo&s;e him&s;elf and his many Servants to danger, that he might re&s;cue <HI>Lot</HI> out of the hands of his Enemies.

Such an one was <HI>Nehe|miah,</HI> who denied him&s;elf, laid a&s;ide his ea&s;e, turn'd his back upon the plea&s;ures of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Court, &amp; was willing to engage with manifold difficulties, in travelling from <HI>Shu&s;han</HI> to <HI>Jeru&s;alem;</HI> which was Nine hundred miles.

Tho&s;e Excellent Per&s;ons that were the fir&s;t Beginners of the&s;e Plantati|ons, were endued with largene&s;s of heart to promote the Weal of this whole People: The <HI>College</HI> which hath been of abundant u&s;e to this whole Land, is a &s;tanding Monument of it.

<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 1. Becau&s;e this is to an&s;wer the end and de&s;ign of God in the be&s;towal of his Ble&s;&s;ings: which is, that men may be put into a better capacity of doing good, than others are. The more good God be&s;tows

upon any, the more Service to his Name he looks for from &s;uch. As for tho&s;e that are by God called into Places of Authority over others, from &s;uch he looks for great Diligence in order to the furtherance of the good of others; as it is expre&s;&s;ed in <HI>Rom.</HI> 13. 4. <HI>He is the Mini&s;ter of God for good.</HI> People are not made for <HI>Rulers,</HI> but <HI>Rulers</HI> are &s;et up for the &s;ake and good of <HI>People.</HI> Whether in ca&s;e of mans per&s;eve|rance in that &s;tate of integrity in which he was fir&s;t made, there had been need of Magi&s;trates to Govern men, is not &s;o ea&s;ily determined; tho' Order then as pre&s;cribed in the Fifth Command, would have been ob&s;erved. But now there is an apparent nece&s;&s;ity of Magi&s;trates, partly to re&s;train men from tho&s;e exorbitant motions that their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">u&s;ts would unavoidably in&s;tigate them unto: and partly to provoke them to the doing tho&s;e duties, that the Law of God, and light of nature dictate ought to be done. So that the End of God in furni&s;hing per|&s;ons with intellectual abilities, and cloathing them with Authority, whereby they are called to the exerci&s;e of them; is to promote the weal and benefit of others. This is expre&s;&s;ed by the Apo&s;tle, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2. 1, 2. where people are required to pray for Magi&s;trates, Supream and Subordinate, that their Councels and Purpo&s;es may be &s;o di&s;po&s;ed by God, that under them we may live a quiet and peaceable life in all godline&s;s and hone&s;ty; whereby it is plainly intimated, that the advancement of per&s;ons into Places of Authority, is intended by God for the &s;piritual and temporal weal of People and Societies. And there|fore for &s;uch as are &s;et over others, to u&s;e their power for the hurt and oppre&s;&s;ion of &s;uch as are under them, is a plain perverting of the end of God in the be&s;towal of tho&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings upon them. Hence for the preventing of this, God hath given Rules in his Word to people that have liberty of Chu&s;ing their Magi&s;trates, to direct them in Elect|ing &s;uch as are rightly qualifyed, who will &s;tudy to promote their good, and will abhor to do any thing that is incon&s;i&s;tent with their weal.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Becau&s;e this doth directly tend to the Glorifying of God.</HI> When per|&s;ons that &s;tand higher than others, are careful to make a right u&s;e of tho&s;e advantages that God puts into their hands, they become very &s;erviceable to the Name and Honour of God: Tho&s;e by their well-ordered Conver&s;ation do greatly encourage others to an imi|tation of them: For the Examples of &s;uch are very influential upon others. Such will practically rebuke others that are &s;candalous in their actions; and they will be afraid to do tho&s;e things that are op|po&s;ite to the Laws of God, and ju&s;t Laws of men; as the Apo&s;tle in|timates,

This Truth pre&s;ents us with matter of <HI>Joy</HI> and <HI>Comfort,</HI> in that there are yet with us that are truly and properly Ble&s;&s;ings in their &s;e|veral Places and Capacities: For who&s;e Sake we may hope that after the Righteous God hath in Mercy cha&s;tened us, for our revoltings from, and decayes of Love to Him&s;elf, and his Ordinances; and thereby brought us to a true &s;en&s;e of our Sins, and thereby wrought in us a &s;in|cere purpo&s;e to amend our Evils: He will Save us, and make us a Prai&s;e and Glory. With us are many Pious Ones, who are glorious within; being adorned with the Graces of Gods Holy Spirit, who are endea|vouring
<PB N="16" REF="001205_0017_0FB133DFC9FE9FD0">
to Walk with, &amp; act for God, in their re&s;pective Capacities; Striv|ing in all things to plea&s;e their Heavenly Father, and to Walk Worthy of him, who hath Called them to his Kingdom &amp; Glory. I believe there are as many real Saints in this Land, as in any Land or Nation in the World, for the quantity of People. And that which is to be minded, is, That our Magi&s;trates and Mini&s;ters are Pious &amp; Religious, who are Seekers of God, and do &s;edulou&s;ly &s;et them&s;elves to promote the Spiritual, as well as the Temporal Weal of Gods People in this Wilderne&s;s. We have yet many Praying <HI>Abrahams, Nehemiahs, Elijahs</HI> and <HI>Jeremiahs,</HI> that are pleading with God, and Crying with Tears, &s;aying to God, O &s;pare thy People, and give not thy Heritage to become a prey to the Heathens! We read of Gods readine&s;s to &s;pare <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah,</HI> if there were but ten Righteous Per&s;ons among them: and are there not among us more than an hundred times Ten? Yea, we find God ready to Par|don his People, if they could but find a <HI>Man, Jer.</HI> 5. 1. That is, a faithful and zealous <HI>Magi&s;trate:</HI> and are there not many &s;uch with us? Who de&s;ire to <HI>do Ju&s;tly, &s;hew Mercy, and walk humbly with their God:</HI> Who tho' they may be defective (and who is not?) yet are endeavouring to Rule and Direct this People, over whom they are Set, according to the Integrity of their hearts, and Skilfulne&s;s of their hands. Yea, are there not &s;everal Well-qualifyed Per&s;ons with us, who are prepared in a good mea&s;ure to act in the Place of Magi&s;tracy, and Mini&s;try? If we take mea&s;ure by Gods acting with his own People of old: We may fo&s;ter and maintain Hopes within us, that God will not as yet reject us, nor Write a <HI>Loammi</HI> upon us. Tho' it is true that in Go&s;pel times God may ju&s;tly make quicker Work now with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> vi&s;ible People, by bring|ing &s;ore and ruinating Judgments upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">m, than he did upon his People heretofore; in regard of the greater plenty of Light, that hath &s;hined upon, and Love that hath been &s;hown to us. I would not venture to &s;ay any thing of this nature, to lull any a&s;leep in a Secure and Sinful State. Let us therefore know, We that have received more Mercies, and have enjoyed greater Privileges than others; if we re|main in an Unbelieving and Impenitent State; We &s;hall be liable to bear and &s;uffer greater mea&s;ures of Woe &amp; Wrath, than others, <HI>Amos</HI> 3. 2. <HI>You only have I known of all the Families of the Earth, therefore I will puni&s;h you for all your iniquities.</HI> Our greater exaltation to <HI>Heaven</HI> will make way for our great depre&s;&s;ion in <HI>Hell, Mat.</HI> 11. 23. All &s;uch will find that their Church-Privileges and formal Performances of Duties, will be but as a Paper-Wall again&s;t a con&s;uming Fire: as the <HI>Jews,</HI> in <HI>Jeremiahs</HI> time, found it by &s;ad and woful experience.</P>

<HI>To &s;uch as are our Political Fathers:</HI></P>
<P>Let me with much Re&s;pect and deep Humility addre&s;s your Excel|lency: Much Honoured SIR, The Unerring Hand of Divine Pro|vidence hath Set you on High, making you the Head &amp; Chief Ruler, under our Gracious Sovereign, of the People of this Province; Placing you in the Seat of Ju&s;tice and Chair of Honour: whereby you are in a Capacity of being a Rich Ble&s;&s;ing to this People of God. 'Tis to be hoped that the Sen&s;e of Gods great goodne&s;s in your Exaltation to &s;o High a pitch of Honour and Authority; together with the Con&s;ide|ration of His &s;ignal Mercy in effecting Salvation from great and immi|nent Dangers heretofore; and e&s;pecially of Late; (upon the account of which we have abundant rea&s;on to give Thanks to God) will in|fluence your Heart into a Willingne&s;s to improve your admirable Accompli&s;hments for the furtherance of the Welfare and Safety of this People, over whom you are made Chief Ruler; by Encouraging &s;uch as are Religious; and di&s;couraging &s;uch as are Profane and Vitious; Rewarding the One, and Puni&s;hing the Other. Doubtle&s;s, when <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> that Renowned Ruler of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> had made a Serious reflection upon the peculiar Mercy of God in pre&s;erving his Life, that was in eminent danger by means of that cruel Edict of <HI>Pharaoh;</HI> as al&s;o Gods remem|bring him when Swimming on the River in a little Canoo made of Bulru&s;hes; putting him into a near Relation to the King of <HI>Egypts</HI> Daughter, whereby he had a liberal Education in the Court of <HI>Pharaoh&punc;</HI> all this wrought his heart into a forwardne&s;s to lay out him&s;elf for the Honour of God, and the good of his own afflicted People. Honoured SIR, You have had very fair Copies heretofore in tho&s;e that have been Governours of this People, pre&s;ented before you (from One of which, who was Eminent for Parts and Piety you have immediately de&s;cend|ed) after which, if by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Gods Spirit, you endeavour to Write; You will be, as they were, a &s;ignal Ble&s;&s;ing to this People; by which you will confute the Jealou&s;ies and Cen&s;ures of &s;ome; and an&s;wer the Hopes and Expectations of others: and &s;o a Ble&s;&s;ing will come down upon you, and yours.</P>
<P>As for tho&s;e Honoured Per&s;ons that are concerned in the Govern|ment of the People in this Province; <HI>viz.</HI> The Honoured Deputy Governour, and the Coun&s;ellors, that may be Cho&s;en this Day&punc; Honoured SIRS, You are called to Sit with his Excellency at the Helm, to guide and order the affairs of this Province, in a Stormy and Tempe&s;tuous time: therefore you have need of much Prudence and Patience, that you may act aright in order to the promotion of the
<PB N="18" REF="001205_0019_0FB133E224BF9BA8">
Welfare &amp; Safety of this People. That one Title, which is Superiour to all others; <HI>viz.</HI> that you are <HI>Gods, P&s;al.</HI> 82. 6. that intimates to you that you are to be Ble&s;&s;ings. That Title <HI>Elohim</HI> is the fir&s;t of tho&s;e <HI>Hebrew</HI> Names, that are given to GOD, which we find in the fir&s;t line of the Bible: Who having by His infinite perfections Erected this Stately Edifice of the World, and furni&s;hed every Room thereof with variety of Creatures, hath an ab&s;olute &amp; Underived Authority to Rule and Govern all Things. This Name and honourable Title He hath fixed upon you whereby He tells you that your Power is derived from Him, and that as He hath &s;et you above many; &s;o you are to imitate Him in Goodne&s;s and U&s;efulne&s;s; that by the &s;weet and benign In|fluences of your Authority you become In&s;truments in furthering the Good and Benefit of all &s;uch as are under you, by a due and right Re|gulation of the Affairs of this People of God, and that you in an e&s;pe|cial manner &s;hew it in advancing Religion and Godline&s;s, taking care that the Hou&s;e of God be not for&s;aken, and his holy Sabbaths be not prophaned. About tho&s;e, <HI>Nehemiah</HI> that Pious Ruler acted with an holy Zeal, as we may &s;ee in that Book which bears his Name.</P>
<P>It concerns tho&s;e worthy Gentlemen, the Repre&s;entatives of this Province, to be very carefull in putting in their Suffrages for Council|lors, that they be Per&s;ons duly Qualified, who may give grounded Hopes that they will in all things act &s;o, as that they may be Ble&s;&s;ings to this People of GOD: and that they readily concur in making &s;uch Acts and Laws, as apparently tend to the Furtherance of Piety, and Equity. If it might not be accounted too much boldne&s;s, I would pro|po&s;e One thing to &s;uch as have the power of Legi&s;lation: Whether it be not needful that there be &s;omething Enacted to quicken under Of|ficers, as <HI>Tything-men, Con&s;tables, and Grand-Iurors,</HI> to a more Vigorous accompli&s;hment of tho&s;e Promi&s;ory Oaths that Annu|ally they take, in the Suppre&s;&s;ing of Intemperance and Di&s;orders, that &s;eem to be growing among us. It is to be feared, That &s;everal of tho&s;e Officers do forget their Oaths, thinking that unle&s;s Complaints drop into their Ears, they are no way concern'd to act in their Places.</P>
<P>Let me &s;ay a few words to the <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> of the Go&s;pel, not for their Information, but for their Excitation to the doing of tho&s;e things that they fully know.</P>
<P><HI>Reverend Sirs,</HI> The many Honourable Titles that by the Holy Gho&s;t in the Scriptures are fixed upon <HI>Mini&s;ters;</HI> as <HI>Lights of the World, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">-workers with Chri&s;t, Me&s;&s;engers of the Lord of Ho&s;ts,</HI> and <HI>Amba&s;&s;adors of
<PB N="19" REF="001205_0020_0FB133E3C2649068">
Chri&s;t:</HI> The&s;e with many others do point out our Duty, that we &s;hould &s;o act in our Places&punc; that we may be Ble&s;&s;ings, in being Serviceable to all that we &s;tand related to; by a diligent improvement of all our A|bilities for the advancement of the Spiritual and Eternal Weal of the Souls of men. It is mo&s;t certain, that the Mini&s;try is a Signal Ble&s;&s;ing, and one of tho&s;e Royal Gifts which our Exalted Lord Je&s;us gave to his Church, when he Rode in Triumph into Heaven; as is evident by what we find in <HI>Eph.</HI> 4. 10, 11. <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 30. 20, 21. Hereupon we are bound to give a plain and faithful Declaration of the whole Coun&s;el of God, &s;o far as we are able: That &s;olemn charge which is u&s;ually given to Mini&s;ters at their In&s;tallment into this Sacred Office of the Mini&s;try, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4. 1, 2. ought frequently to be minded by us. And it &s;hould be our great care to maintain the honour of Go&s;pel Truths which we publi&s;h; by an un&s;tained and un&s;potted Conver&s;ation. We are not only <GAP DESC="foreign"> rightly to divide the Word of God, and as faithful Stew|ards, to give to every one their portion: But withal, we are <GAP DESC="foreign"> to walk aright, tran&s;cribing the Laws of the Go&s;pel in our lives and actions. Such as did bear the Ve&s;&s;els of the Sanctuary, were to be ho|ly in a peculiar manner; the Prie&s;ts were to be void of bodily defects, they were to have their <HI>Urim</HI> &amp; <HI>Thummim;</HI> as al&s;o a Bell and Pome|granate: the meaning of which we are not ignorant of. If our <HI>Acti|ons</HI> do not corre&s;pond with our <HI>In&s;tructions</HI> and <HI>Reprehen&s;ions;</HI> they will be in a great mea&s;ure in&s;ignificant. We &s;hall pull down with one hand, what we build up with the other. We are by the <HI>Purity</HI> of our Doctrine, and <HI>Piety</HI> of our lives, to endeavour to win men to Chri&s;t, and to bring them out of love with their evil wayes; in a liking of the good Wayes of God, and &s;o we &s;hall &s;ave our &s;elves, and tho&s;e that hear us. In a word, the Honour of the ble&s;&s;ed God, the Welfare of mens Souls, and our own Peace in a Dying Hour, are arguments very cogent to provoke as all to a faithful di&s;charge of the Duties of our Places. One thing I would propo&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> That we all endeavour af|ter Unity in our <HI>Affections,</HI> and &s;o far as we can, in our <HI>Apprehen&s;ions.</HI> It is a good rule delivered by &s;ome: <HI>In nece&s;&s;ariis Unitas, in non nece&s;&s;ariis Libertas, in utri&s;que Charitas.</HI> We are all well agreed as to Fundamentals of Doctrine and Order; we &s;hould therefore exerci&s;e Charity towards &s;uch as may differ from us in matters that are not &s;o plainly revealed in the Word about Church-Di&s;cipline, and may be lookt upon as mat|ters of a prudential nature; forbearing to brand &s;uch as differ from us, and do not &s;o fully concur with &s;uch things as have been practi&s;ed, with the ill Titles of Apo&s;tates, and Subverters of the Order of the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="001205_0021_0FB133E518C79CD8">
I &s;hall conclude with a few words to all: Let us all act &s;o as we may be in our re&s;pective places Ble&s;&s;ings; In order thereunto,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Let us become the true and &s;incere Servants of God, re&s;olving to Obey, and be Subject to him in all things.</HI> It is our honour, and it will be our com|fort, to be able to &s;ay with <HI>Paul,</HI> that we are the Servants of God, &s;tri|ving in all things to glorifie his name, <HI>Act.</HI> 27. 23. Let our Wills be re&s;olved into Gods Will; this will con&s;titute us good m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n, and render us Ble&s;&s;ings: according to the &s;aying of an Heathen, <GAP DESC="foreign">, a Good man is a common good; which agrees with what <HI>Solo|mon</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Prov.</HI> 29. 8. <HI>Wi&s;e men turn away wrath.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Let us be Thankful for the many Privileges and peculiar Mercies that we are at pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with.</HI> Tho' it may not be &s;o well with us as it hath been; yet be &s;ure it is far better with us than it is with many others. That we have our Titles to our Hou&s;es and Lands confirm|ed to us, &s;o as that we need not fear a Writ of Ejectment to be Served upon us, for want of a Patent: That we have a Government &s;et over us, is a mercy to be minded: <HI>Tyranny</HI> is accounted more eligible than <HI>Anarchy.</HI> Without Government and Magi&s;tracy the World would be as one &s;tyles it, <HI>Magnum Latrocinium, q. d.</HI> a great Den of Thieves and Robbers: <HI>Might would bear down Right.</HI> Men, like Dogs, would try their titles with their teeth; and all difference between <HI>Meum</HI> and <HI>Tuum</HI> would be aboli&s;hed. But that which challengeth our thankfulne&s;s is, that we are Governed by Religious Magi&s;trates, who reckon it to be their Duty to be at all times, <HI>Utriu&s;que tabulae Cu&s;todes,</HI> by means of which the wayes to our Solemn A&s;&s;emblies do not mourn; and &s;o we are a ble&s;&s;ed People, in that we hear and know the joyful Sound, and may with joy draw Water out of the Wells of Salvation, walking in the light of Gods Countenance, and may expect al&s;o to have redre&s;s of wrongs and injuries done unto us. Un&s;en&s;iblene&s;s of Gods Mercies, and our unthankfulne&s;s for them, is one of our provoking Evils; there|fore that we may obtain Ble&s;&s;ings from God, &amp; a removal of his Judg|ments; let us, every one of us &s;et the Crown of Prai&s;e upon Gods Head, and be inwardly affected with his peculiar favours be&s;towed on us. Let us be Prayerful; all &s;uch have been Ble&s;&s;ings in their places, as <HI>Mo&s;es, David</HI> were, who frequently with fervency were applying them&s;elves by Prayer unto God for all manner of Mercies &s;uitable and needful for them&s;elves and others. The calamitous nature of the time doth require of us the performance of this Duty, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 50. 15. We ne|ver find a Saint of God in Affliction, but we find him upon his knees,
<PB N="21" REF="001205_0022_0FB133E692C1C5E8">
as is evident in <HI>Jacob, David,</HI> and others. Prayer rightly performed, hath a kind of Omnipotency in it; as <HI>Mo&s;es, Elijah</HI> and others their Prayers had. This is that Golden Key, which being oyled with Tears, and turn'd with the hand of Faith, will unlock the Cabinet of the Promi&s;es, and thereby many Ble&s;&s;ings will be flowing in upon us: And in an e&s;pecial manner, let us Pray for our Rulers, as it is plainly required without any exception or limitation: This Command was given when <HI>Nero</HI> that mon&s;ter of men for wickedne&s;s, was Emperor, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2. 1, 2. Would we have our Magi&s;trates to be Ble&s;&s;ings: Let us &s;trive with God in our Prayers for them. The hearts of Kings and Rulers are in the Hand of God, who can di&s;po&s;e all their purpo&s;es and councels, &s;o as that they &s;hall conduce to, and i&s;&s;ue in the Good and Weal of his People. Did People turn their malicious <HI>Prating</HI> again&s;t Magi&s;trates and Mini&s;ters, into ardent <HI>Praying</HI> for them, they would both honour them&s;elves, and the Name of God, call'd upon them.</P>
<P>Let us &s;tand clear from ra&s;h Judging and Cen&s;uring our Rulers. Certain it is, that People are not competent judges of the actions of Magi&s;trates: it is a u&s;ual &s;aying, that there are <HI>Arcana Imperii,</HI> My&s;te|ries of State, to the bottom of which, People are not able to dive.</P>
<P>Let us not entertain groundle&s;s Jealou&s;ies of our Rulers. This hath put People &s;ometimes into an unquiet, yea, into a rebellious Po&s;ture; and at no time they prevail &s;o much as when di&s;tre&s;s and hard&s;hips have been predominant: as we find it in <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 8. 21. <HI>They &s;hall pa&s;s through it, hardly be&s;tead and hungry,</HI>&mdash;<HI>they &s;hall fret them&s;elves, and Cur&s;e their King, &amp; their God.</HI> We have in&s;tances of this in Scripture, as of <HI>Mo|&s;es, Exod.</HI> 14. 11, 12. whom the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> were ready to Stone, as the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Hi&s;torian &s;aith, but his <HI>Meckne&s;s</HI> overcame their <HI>Madne&s;s.</HI> And <HI>David</HI> was in great hazard of his Life when he came to <HI>Ziklag,</HI> 1 Sam. 30. 6. <HI>The People were greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and they &s;pake of Stoning of him.</HI> We &s;hould root out all hard thoughts of our Rulers; Endeavouring that our hearts be filled with Love to them: thereby we &s;hall con&s;true all their actions in the be&s;t &s;en&s;e; and &s;o live a quiet and peaceable Life under them.</P>
<P>Let People account it their Duty to Contribute to the Comforta|ble &amp; Honourable Support of their Rulers: This is expre&s;sly required, <HI>Rom.</HI> 13. 7. Our Saviour exemplifyed this Command in his own Practice: who wrought a Miracle that he might have Money to pay Tribute, <HI>Matth.</HI> 22. 21. which he did partly to prevent Offence, and partly to &s;ee an Example to all Chri&s;tians in after Generations. The height and dignity of their Places calls for it, for God allows his Vicegerents, <HI>viz.</HI>
