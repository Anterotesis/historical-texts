<BIBL>ISAIAH IV. 5.</BIBL>
<Q>&mdash;FOR UPON ALL THE GLORY SHALL BE A DE|FENCE.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>FOR the &s;upport and comfort of tho&s;e among the Jews, who might e&s;cape the judgments predicted in the preceding chapter, the prophet in this fortels the ap|proach of happier times, and the flouri&s;hing &s;tate of the true I&s;rael of God, under the influence and protection of an illu&s;trious per&s;on here called <HI>the Branch of the Lord.</HI> After the appearance of this divine Branch, the chil|dren of Zion, clean&s;ed from their pollutions <HI>by the &s;pirit of judgment</HI> and adorned with vital holine&s;s, &s;hall re|joice in all the ble&s;&s;ings of evangelical grace and con|&s;olation. The favourable pre&s;ence of God with them &s;hall &s;ecure to them the continued enjoyment of the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings. For his pre&s;ence brings protection and de|fence to all who are thus favoured. So long as he a|bode in the temple at Jeru&s;alem, and his vi&s;ible glory
<PB N="4" REF="021353_0003_0FB3193F4632D678">
was beheld in the holy of holies, that city bid defiance to all earthly powers. But, after the voice had been heard "LET US DEPART HENCE," its defence was gone, its enemies prevailed again&s;t it, and <HI>Zion was plowed as a field.</HI></P>
<P>In allu&s;ion to the pillar of cloud and fire, the ancient &s;ymbol of God's pre&s;ence with I&s;rael in the wilderne&s;s, it is promi&s;ed, with reference to the people of the Me&s;|&s;iah, <HI>The Lord will create upon every dwelling place of Mount Sion, and upon her a&s;&s;emblies a cloud and &s;moke by day, and the &s;hining of a flaming fire by night:</HI> The mean|ing is, that they &s;hall be as certainly under the divine care and guardian&s;hip, as were God's people of old, while favoured with the&s;e extraordinary &s;igns of his gracious pre&s;ence, and &s;hall as fully experience the hap|py effects of his Almighty protection. <HI>For upon all the glory &s;hall be a defence:</HI> Providence will watch for the &s;afety of the church, and "the gates of hell &s;hall never prevail again&s;t it."</P>
<P>The prophecy evidently refers to the &s;tate of the chri&s;tian church under the reign of the Me&s;&s;iah. As a part of this church, we may be allowed, perhaps, to con|&s;ider the words of the text as applicable to our&s;elves; and be led by them, on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, into a view of tho&s;e &s;ignal and di&s;tingui&s;hing advantages which are the glory of this land; and then, to &s;ome remarks on the means of defence as proper and ne|ce&s;&s;ary to crown the&s;e advantages and complete the glory.</P>
<P>The latter idea is, indeed, the principal and ultimate de&s;ign of the di&s;cour&s;e. This, however, will be aided by con&s;idering the worth of tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings and privi|leges
<PB N="5" REF="021353_0004_0FB31943ADE3A670">
which we have to defend. All the&s;e are &s;o many motives to the means of defence. And &s;urely no peo|ple upon earth can have more, or weightier. That their influence may be felt, this A&s;&s;embly will allow me to &s;et before them &s;ome of our natural, civil, and re|ligious advantages.</P>
<P>Had it been left to our own election, on what part of the globe we would have wi&s;hed to &s;pend the days of our pilgrimage here below, we could not, perhaps, have cho&s;en better for our&s;elves, than Providence hath cho&s;en for us. "The lines are fallen to us in a plea&s;ant place, and we have a goodly heritage." Falling, as our country does, within the temperate climes, its inhabi|tants are &s;ubjected to the extremes of neither heat, nor cold: Both of which are deemed unfriendly to the hu|man frame, prejudicial not only to the body, but to the mind too, as tending to debilitate, or deaden its pow|ers, and limit its exertions. Philo&s;ophers tell us, that it is in the temperate climates only, other circum&s;tances being equal, that we are to expect the greate&s;t di&s;play of human abilities. Upon this principle, &s;hould we not feel grateful to HIM who "&s;eparateth the &s;ons of Adam, and divideth to the nations their inheritance," for ca&s;ting our lot on a portion of the earth the mo&s;t favourable to our growth and improvement in what|ever dignifies and adorns the character of man?</P>
<P>It is not pretended that the &s;oil which we cultivate, equals, in richne&s;s and fertility, that of &s;ome other countries. In tho&s;e regions of the earth which lie more expo&s;ed to the &s;un, there is a greater variety of vege|tation, and a more luxuriant and abundant growth. The&s;e advantages, however, are often more than ba|lanced by poi&s;onous productions, noxious animals, and
<PB N="6" REF="021353_0005_0FB31944E0DE69D8">
a putrid air, breeding all kinds of di&s;ea&s;e; and by tem|pe&s;ts, hurricanes, earthquakes, and &s;uch violent com|motions of the elements as are frequently fatal to the wretched inhabitants. Exempt from the&s;e fatalities, our own country is rich in whatever contributes to the &s;upport and &s;olid enjoyment of life. The earth &s;o far repays the labour of the hu&s;bandman, that the horrors of famine, often experienced in other parts of the world, have never been known here.</P>
<P>And it is a &s;ignal advantage in our &s;ituation, that the cultivators of the &s;oil are al&s;o its proprietors. In the old countries the common people are in general tenants, having no other right or intere&s;t in the lands which they improve, but lea&s;es from great proprietors, upon whom they are &s;o abjectly dependent, that they are often con&s;idered and treated as nearly upon a par with the other animals belonging to the &s;oil. How incomparably more eligible is the condition of the com|monalty of this country? In the&s;e northern States e&s;pecially, the lands are divided with a degree of equali|ty, and a happy mediocrity generally prevails. The body of the people is compo&s;ed of a &s;ub&s;tantial yeo|manry, who cultivate their own freeholds, and feel no other dependence but upon Providence and their own indu&s;try.</P>
<P>It is a fact known and acknowledged, that in no other part of the world, the generality of the people are &s;o independent, or po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;o large a &s;hare of the con|veniencies of life. The facility with which the means of a comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence are obtained, is the main cau&s;e of that rapid increa&s;e of population which here exceeds any thing, of which any other country can boa&s;t. From a few emigrants and &s;cattered planters,
<PB N="7" REF="021353_0006_0FB319465F00D420">
in a little more than a century and an half, we are mul|tiplied into millions. And this increa&s;e is likely to continue through the cour&s;e of many future generations, until the immen&s;e wilderne&s;s on our back &s;hall be turned into a fruitful field.</P>
<P>The progre&s;s of cultivation and improvement mu&s;t be greatly accelerated by the mild, gentle and free go|vernments which are here e&s;tabli&s;hed. In this re&s;pect, the&s;e States are "the glory of all lands," and privileged above every other nation. As for liberty, it is a &s;tranger hardly known to the re&s;t of mankind. In two quarters of the globe the &s;ound thereof is not heard, nor its likene&s;s &s;een. If you range through the great empires of A&s;ia, and among all the millions that people Africa, you will hardly find an individual into who&s;e mind the idea of a rational, civil freedom has ever entered. Eu|rope alone is the enlightened quarter of the world. But even in Europe de&s;poti&s;m is almo&s;t univer&s;al. The governments of France, Spain, Italy, Germany, and Mu&s;|covy are in general ab&s;olute monarchies. Among the&s;e, indeed, a few republicks are inter&s;per&s;ed: But the mo&s;t of the&s;e republicks partake of the ari&s;tocratick form. Venice the mo&s;t ancient of them, and once the mo&s;t re&s;|pectable, is a proper ari&s;tocracy, the powers of govern|ment being wholly in the hands of the nobles, inde|pendent of the voice, the election, or the controul of the people. In a limited monarchy Britain boa&s;ts of freedom; but, con&s;idering how far &s;he has deviated from the principles and &s;pirit of her con&s;titution&mdash;the manner in which her Hou&s;e of Commons is elected, and the influence of the Crown in tho&s;e elections, her freedom &s;eems but little more than a boa&s;t&mdash;a &s;hadow without the &s;ub&s;tance. Nor is the government of the United Netherlands thought to be much better, con&s;i|dering
<PB N="8" REF="021353_0007_0FB31947D99E5598">
the weight of the ari&s;tocratick influence and the powers of an hereditary Stadtholder.&mdash;In &s;hort, Liberty, bani&s;hed from the other quarters of the globe, has with|drawn to the American &s;hores. In the&s;e States &s;he has found an a&s;ylum, and &s;eems to be fixing her re&s;i|dence. Her &s;pirit breathes in, and animates the &s;everal branches of our political con&s;titutions; and her features are &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed on the re&s;pective forms of go|vernment which have been here con&s;tructed. The peo|ple them&s;elves are made the guardians of their own rights; and from them all power originates. Rulers exi&s;t not but by their &s;uffrages; and the greate&s;t of them are but &s;ervants to the publick, and are liable to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from that &s;ervice whenever they di&s;|plea&s;e their ma&s;ters. Created by the people, &s;uch is their &s;ituation, they are made to feel their dependence upon their creators.</P>
<P>We have no accounts of any republicks, whether an|cient or modern, in which &s;uch principles of equal li|berty prevail. In this re&s;pect our glory out&s;hines that of the whole world be&s;ides.</P>
<P>I mean not, however, that our political con&s;titutions are perfect. It would be next to a miracle, if in a &s;trug|gle to avoid impending danger from one extreme, we did not expo&s;e our&s;elves to hazard on the oppo&s;ite. Defects there certainly are in the modes of government adopted by the&s;e States&mdash;principally re&s;ulting, in the opinion of the wi&s;e, from the exce&s;s of their popularity.</P>
<P>But do we not hope, ere long, to &s;ee the&s;e defects happily &s;upplied and remedied by that admirable form of federal government which is now rearing over the whole union? May God Almighty aid the exertions of
<PB N="9" REF="021353_0008_0FB3194967E1DE90">
true patriots in rai&s;ing the remaining Pillars of this no|ble Structure! And when completed, may his provi|dence &s;o &s;mile upon the in&s;titution, as to cau&s;e it to an|&s;wer the mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations of its illu&s;trious fram|ers! May it prove an effectual &s;helter from popular heats and commotions on the one part, and from foreign tempe&s;ts and inva&s;ions on the other!</P>
<P>To the latter, indeed, our &s;ituation does not immedi|ately expo&s;e us. It mu&s;t be reckoned among the advan|tages of the&s;e States, that they lie not in the neigh|bourhood of any formidable power. A thou&s;and leagues of ocean rolling between us and the wrang|ling powers of Europe, le&s;&s;ens the danger of our being involved in their quarrels.</P>
<P>But, as another circum&s;tance reflecting a di&s;tingui&s;h|ed glory upon our country, we may con&s;ider the means of education which are here enjoyed, and the advan|tages we are under for pu&s;hing our improvements in every branch of u&s;eful knowledge, and in all tho&s;e arts which embelli&s;h &s;ociety, and give to man his principal preeminence above the bea&s;ts that peri&s;h. From the bea&s;ts, at his birth, he is no otherwi&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hed but by a capacity for the&s;e improvements: Which yet he will not make, unle&s;s he be furni&s;hed with the means of education. If his hard lot be ca&s;t in the regions of darkne&s;s, where he has no helps or advantages for culti|vating his rea&s;on, and meliorating and governing his pa&s;&s;ions; if he be nouri&s;hed in the dens of uncivil|ized men&mdash;among &s;avages and barbarians, he proves a barbarian him&s;elf, wild and intractable, and but little &s;uperiour to the irrational animals.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="021353_0009_0FB3194AD14DEE80">
It is a melancholy reflection, that this charac|ter belongs to &s;o many tribes and nations of the po&s;terity of Adam. Was it owing to his apo&s;tacy, that his children who inhabit the regions of Africa, from the tropick of <HI>Cancer</HI> to the <HI>Cape of Good-Hope,</HI> who form the clans and hords which range the immen&s;e tracts on the north of Europe, and north-we&s;t of A&s;ia; and who compo&s;e the tribes of Indians that are &s;cattered in America, from the north of Canada to the &s;traits of Magellan?&mdash;Was it owing to the fall of our common ance&s;tor, that the&s;e his de&s;cendants &s;uffer &s;uch a de|gradation of their nature, and are &s;unk in deplorable, bruti&s;h ignorance and barbari&s;m?&mdash;Whatever may have been the original, meritorious or judicial; yet certainly the immediate cau&s;e is their neglect of educa|tion and of all attempts towards mental improvement.</P>
<P>The main difference in the characters of different nations re&s;ults from the neglect or the improvement of tho&s;e powers of rea&s;on which their Creator has given them. In proportion as any people have cultivated arts and knowledge, they have ri&s;en to di&s;tinction and eminence. The never fading lu&s;tre of the Grecian and Roman name&mdash;the figure which they make in the an|nals of mankind&mdash;and the uncea&s;ing eclat and renown with which they are tran&s;mitted from one generation to another&mdash;are all ultimately derived from the a&s;&s;idui|ty and &s;ucce&s;s with which they laboured in accumulat|ing intellectual trea&s;ures&mdash;in improving their own minds&mdash;in poli&s;hing &s;ociety&mdash;and civilizing the rude and barbarous nations around them. To tho&s;e learned ancients every &s;ucceeding age, and even the pre&s;ent, is indebted for many of the fir&s;t rudiments of knowledge.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="021353_0010_0FB3194E7B0B0168">
In the convul&s;ions and revolutions which attended the decline and fall of that immen&s;e fabrick, the Roman empire; the progre&s;s of &s;cience, and of the arts of civili|zation was not only at a &s;tand; but many of the im|provements which had been already made, were lo&s;t. Nor did they revive again, until towards the clo&s;e of the fifteenth and beginning of the &s;ixteenth century of the Chri&s;tian era. At this period, many different cau&s;es con&s;pired for delivering the under&s;tandings of men from the bondage of ignorance&mdash;&s;uch as the invention of the art of printing&mdash;the improvements in navigation&mdash;the exten&s;ion of commerce&mdash;the breaking forth of a &s;pirit of indu&s;try, enterpri&s;e and inquiry; and above all, the reformation from popery which emancipated the hu|man mind from the &s;hackles of &s;uper&s;tition, and gave &s;cope to its various abilities.</P>
<P>From that day to this, knowledge has been rapid|ly increa&s;ing; new di&s;coveries, new arts and new im|provements have been con&s;tantly adding to former ac|qui&s;itions, until the learning of the pre&s;ent age as far exceeds that of the ancients, as their's did that of the rude ages which preceded them.</P>
<P>When our ance&s;tors removed into this new world, they brought the learning of the old along with them; and upon their arrival here, their fir&s;t care was, to plant it in this new &s;oil. They founded colleges and &s;emi|naries of learning, and formed excellent regulations for the &s;upport of publick &s;chools, and a learned, pious clergy in all their different plantations. In con&s;equence of their early care and great exertions for the education of youth and training them up in the various branches of u&s;eful knowledge, the growth of the arts and &s;cience&s;
<PB N="12" REF="021353_0011_0FB31951DC6151E0">
has, from the beginning, kept pace with our other im|provements. Knowledge is generally diffu&s;ed, and like our property and our government, is &s;hared among the people at large. And though it &s;hould not be pretend|ed that in new di&s;coveries, and in the number of rare original geniu&s;&s;es, we have exceeded every other nation; yet, it is a truth which foreigners will not deny, that the body of the common people in New-England, at lea&s;t, are the mo&s;t enlightened of any other now upon the globe. In a freedom from many ridiculous preju|dices, whims and cu&s;toms, the relicks of gothic bar|barity, or of popi&s;h &s;uper&s;tition, retained and handed down from age to age among the common people of Europe&mdash;in a freedom from the&s;e, and for a good edu|cation, good &s;en&s;e, and a &s;ound, enlarged under&s;tand|ing, the people here are di&s;tingui&s;hed from, and ri&s;e &s;uperiour to, any other people of their rank in the known world.</P>
<P>This is e&s;pecially true with re&s;pect to religious knowledge, and the advantages we are under for en|joying the glorious privileges of the go&s;pel. Though it be more than &s;eventeen hundred years &s;ince this religion was introduced and publi&s;hed to the world, &s;till the knowledge of it is far from being univer&s;al. A large proportion of the human tace are pagans to this day: The Jews per&s;i&s;t in adhering to the law of Mo&s;es: Many of the ea&s;tern nations are the di&s;ciples of Mahomet; and a great part of Chri&s;tendom remains under the delu&s;ions of popery. It is in the reformed churches only, that the go&s;pel &s;hines; and in the&s;e it too generally &s;hines through the mi&s;t of creeds and formularies. In the European reformed churches the rights of con&s;cience are too little regarded: Religious
<PB N="13" REF="021353_0012_0FB31955A131B610">
liberty too much re&s;trained. The people are rarely allowed to chu&s;e their own teachers: Their teachers them&s;elves are entangled and perplexed with human articles of faith and forms of &s;ub&s;cription: And their modes of wor&s;hip are frequently encumbered with u&s;e|le&s;s rites and ceremonies. From all the&s;e clogs and embarra&s;&s;ments the churches of New-England are per|haps the free&s;t of any in the world; and in their mode of wor&s;hip and method of di&s;cipline approach the near|e&s;t to the &s;implicity of the go&s;pel and the forms in u&s;e with the primitive chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>We ought never to forget, that for the &s;ake of enjoying the&s;e privileges, and tran&s;mitting them to their children, our ance&s;tors encountered all the hard&s;hips and dangers which attended their emigration into this wilderne&s;s. After repeated efforts, they found it im|po&s;&s;ible to obtain them in the land of their nativity. More than a century elap&s;ed after the reformation, be|fore prote&s;tants could be per&s;uaded to entertain the idea of a religious toleration. The fir&s;t reformers, though they renounced the Pope, yet retained one of the wor&s;t dregs of popery&mdash;a &s;pirit of intolerance and per&s;ecution towards every one who ventured to di&s;&s;ent from their creeds, or to profe&s;s what they deemed here&s;y. The contending parties whether papi&s;ts or prote&s;tants, and the different &s;ects among each of the&s;e, however oppo&s;ed in other re&s;pects, yet, all agreed in this one horrible point, "that it was lawful to extirpate by fire and &s;word the enemies of the true religion, and &s;uch they reciprocally appeared to be in each other's eyes."</P>
<P>To them all, and to the age in general, were appli|cable the words of our Saviour to his di&s;ciples, when
<PB N="14" REF="021353_0013_0FB31956DD0F9728">
they would have called for fire from heaven to con&s;ume a village of Samaritans: "Ye know not what &s;pirit ye are of: For the &s;on of man is not come to de&s;troy men's lives, but to &s;ave them." The people of the&s;e States are happy beyond our forefathers, and beyond all for|mer ages of the church, in having found out the mean|ing of this text. It is a mo&s;t important and intere&s;ting di&s;covery&mdash;a di&s;covery of &s;omething very e&s;&s;ential to the chri&s;tian temper&mdash;a di&s;covery of the gracious de|&s;ign and benevolent &s;pirit of the go&s;pel. This is adopt|ed into all our re&s;pective forms of government, which expre&s;&s;ly provide for the equal protection of all &s;ects and denominations, while they demean them&s;elves as good and peaceable &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>Such, my re&s;pected hearers, are the peculiar and di&s;tingui&s;hing advantages which con&s;titute the glory of this land. But to crown all the&s;e advantages and com|plete our glory, DEFENCE is nece&s;&s;ary. The value of every ble&s;&s;ing ri&s;es in proportion to the degree of &s;ecurity which we have for its continued enjoyment. And however advantageou&s;ly &s;ituated the&s;e States may be, to e&s;cape foreign inva&s;ion; yet, if like the inhabit|ants of <HI>Lai&s;h,</HI> we dwell <HI>carele&s;s, quiet</HI> and <HI>&s;ecure,</HI> unpre|pared for defence; we &s;hall invite an evil of which we might otherwi&s;e have been in no danger: And tho&s;e advantages and privileges which are our boa&s;t and our glory, may &s;trongly tempt the ambition of an invader. Nor is it impo&s;&s;ible but that the power, to which we were once in &s;ubjection, may &s;till wi&s;h to recover its lo&s;t dominion, and for years yet to come, watch for an opportunity to effect its purpo&s;e. Nor are the other na|tions of the world free from avarice and ambition, and tho&s;e unruly pa&s;&s;ions and lu&s;ts which occa&s;ion wars and
<PB N="15" REF="021353_0014_0FB31958525469D0">
fightings. And while the&s;e lu&s;ts remain, the earth will be more or le&s;s, <HI>filled with violence.</HI> Partaking, as we all do, of the &s;ame depraved principles, we cannot be &s;ecure from inte&s;tine commotions, in&s;urrections and u&s;urpations. Among our&s;elves Catalines have already appeared: Antonies and Cae&s;ars may ere long &s;pring up. Either by a foreign, or a home-bred tyrant, our liberties may be wre&s;ted from us; if we do not &s;tand prepared to defend them. A people ignorant of the art of war and de&s;titute of the qualifications and virtues which adorn the character of &s;oldiers, mu&s;t be in con|&s;tant danger of falling under the yoke of bondage.</P>
<P>Nor would our character as chri&s;tians, were it free from its pre&s;ent defects, and more perfect than we may venture to pretend, prove our &s;ecurity. For though upon all the glory of Chri&s;t's church a defence is pro|mi&s;ed in the text; yet our own exertions are nece&s;&s;ary in order to our receiving the fulfilment of the promi&s;e. In this &s;en&s;e mo&s;t of the promi&s;es in &s;cripture, whether refering to things temporal or &s;piritual, are to be un|der&s;tood. To his church of old, the &s;eed of Jacob, God promi&s;ed the land of Canaan; but, in order to their getting po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, they were obliged to fight many a rough battle, and to encounter the dangers and hard|&s;hips of many &s;ucce&s;&s;ive campaigns. They had al&s;o a promi&s;e of protection and defence when in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this promi&s;ed land; but were never &s;o &s;en&s;ele&s;s, as to expect the benefit of the promi&s;e without their own endeavours to defend them&s;elves. Hence, it was their care, in a time of peace, to provide again&s;t the breaking out of war. Their mo&s;t pious as well as patriotick princes were vigilant in keeping their country in a &s;tate of defence, in forming magazines of arms, main|taining

garri&s;ons and &s;trong holds on their frontiers, and cheri&s;hing a military &s;pirit among their &s;ubjects&mdash;<HI>teaching them the u&s;e of the bow</HI> and the art of war. In the u&s;e of the&s;e means good men of old relied upon providence for its promi&s;ed protection.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame way chri&s;tians are to expect the fulfil|ment of tho&s;e promi&s;es of defence which are made to the church under the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation. And, in this &s;en&s;e, the&s;e promi&s;es have been always under&s;tood. As the religious character of the be&s;t chri&s;tians has not pre&s;erved them from the a&s;&s;aults of enemies, &s;o neither has it been con&s;idered by them as incon&s;i&s;tent with the profe&s;&s;ion of arms: They have not &s;crupled to gra&s;p the &s;word in their own defence.</P>
<P>No part of the chri&s;tian church, &s;ince the apo&s;tolick age, &s;tood higher, perhaps, in the favour of the Al|mighty, than did the fir&s;t &s;ettlers of this country; nor were more remarkable for relying upon his aid, or more diligent and fervent in &s;eeking it. This, however, did not pre&s;erve them from being expo&s;ed to danger, nor was it con&s;idered by them as precluding the nece&s;&s;ity of providing for their own defence. They had their trials, their fears and dangers from &s;urrounding enemies.</P>
<P>Great as were the di&s;tre&s;&s;es and horrours of the war in which we, a few years &s;ince, were engaged, it may yet be doubted, whether while &s;uffering them, our con|dition in general was &s;o dreadful as was that of our an|ce&s;tors in &s;ome of their wars with the natives of this land.</P>
<P>Our fathers were few in number, remotely &s;cattered

along the&s;e &s;hores. The whole country was a thick wilderne&s;s, filled with numerous tribes of &s;avages. The&s;e were enemies in whom human depravity and wickedne&s;s appeared in all their naked deformity, neither di&s;gui&s;ed nor re&s;trained by the principles of ho|nour and education, or the maxims of civilized &s;ociety. They were perfidious, inhuman and cruel beyond what we can ea&s;ily imagine. Indi&s;criminate de&s;truction was their con&s;tant mode of war. They knew no di&s;tinction of &s;ex or age. Human mi&s;ery was their highe&s;t &s;port. On their wretched captives they inflicted every torture which their barbarous invention could contrive Their attack was always a &s;urpri&s;e. The dark fore&s;ts conceal|ed their motions: From the thicket they &s;uddenly dart|ed upon the unapprehen&s;ive hu&s;bandman at his labour: They butchered or captivated his di&s;tracted family, rifled his hou&s;e, and left it in flames. In the dead of night, or at the dawn of day, the va&s;t &s;ilence of the neighbouring wilderne&s;s was interrupted; and the war|hoop and &s;avage yell announced to the &s;lumbering un|guarded village a ho&s;t of the&s;e mon&s;ters of cruelty. Having accompli&s;hed the de&s;olation, they retired with &s;uch celerity, that pur&s;uers knew not where to find them, until a repetition of the mi&s;chief in &s;ome di&s;tant &s;ettlement gave the information.</P>
<P>In times like the&s;e, and while expo&s;ed to &s;uch dan|gers and fears, among other means of defence, our an|ce&s;tors, a century and an half &s;ince, honoured with char|tered privileges THE COMPANY OF ARTILLERY, at who&s;e reque&s;t we are now a&s;&s;embled. Not mere &s;how and parade, but publick utility was the laudable de&s;ign of this ancient in&s;titution. To learn the art of war, to keep alive a martial &s;pirit, and diffu&s;e abroad in

the country military knowledge, were the purpo&s;es pro|po&s;ed by this e&s;tabli&s;hment. The worthy gentlemen now compo&s;ing it, will &s;till keep them in view; and by their example and influence endeavour, that not only the pre&s;ent, but the ri&s;ing generation may po&s;&s;e&s;s all tho&s;e military accompli&s;hments requi&s;ite to their prov|ing able defenders of their country.</P>
<P>At this juncture, our youth are under &s;pecial ad|vantages for obtaining the&s;e accompli&s;hments, by hav|ing &s;o many among us able to in&s;truct them, who have &s;een &s;o much actual &s;ervice&mdash;had many years experi|ence in the field&mdash;and who&s;e characters are adorned with laurels acquired in the late war. Their know|ledge and experience mu&s;t greatly facilitate the improvements to be wi&s;hed in the &s;tate of our militia; while their recent example cannot fail to in&s;pire with martial ardour the bo&s;oms of our young men.</P>
<P>Such a country as this, is well &s;uited to produce a con|tinued race of heroes. Our militia are naturally hardy, brave and re&s;olute&mdash;not ea&s;ily appalled at the pro&s;pect of difficulties and dangers. And &s;hould they be well di&s;ci|plined and in&s;tructed in the art of war, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a dex|terity and exactne&s;s in its exerci&s;es and manoeuvres;&mdash;&s;hould they become, in the language of &s;cripture, <HI>expert in war&mdash;mighty men of valour&mdash;fit for the battle;</HI> they will undoubtedly prove the be&s;t human defence. And if to the&s;e accompli&s;hments they add a publick &s;pirit, the love of their country, ju&s;t ideas of its rights and privileges, a reverential re&s;pect for its con&s;titution and laws; and have all the&s;e virtues in&s;pired and animated by a true &s;en&s;e of religion; they cannot fail to render us formidable to all who may attempt to mole&s;t
<PB N="19" REF="021353_0018_0FB31962175FDF18">
us. At the &s;ame time, the regulations and habits of obedience and &s;ubordination e&s;&s;ential to a well organized and di&s;ciplined militia mu&s;t, in their natural tendency, &s;ecure internal tranquility, and prevent &s;e|ditions and in&s;urrections.</P>
<P>Impre&s;&s;ed with the weight of this motive alone, our civil fathers will be ever attentive in rendering our mi|litia laws as perfect as po&s;&s;ible. Nor will the endea|vours of our Commander in Chief be wanting in carry|ing the&s;e laws into effect, and giving them the fulle&s;t energy. Seated in the e&s;teem and affection of this peo|ple, he has every advantage for promoting their welfare: His plans for improvement will be received without jealou&s;y or &s;u&s;picion, and his orders obeyed without murmuring or reluctance. And that love of his country and zeal for its pro&s;perity, which have a&s;&s;igned him &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed a rank among the patriots of the age, will prompt his continued vigilance in providing for the common &s;afety.</P>
<P>It is the intere&s;t, and ought to be the endeavour of us all, in our re&s;pective places and &s;tations, to encou|rage and promote, in every &s;uitable way, the&s;e means of defence. A &s;en&s;e of the good land which heaven hath given us, and of the glorious privileges which are here enjoyed, &s;hould quicken our citizens at large, to do all in their power, towards rendering the continued en|joyment of them as &s;ecure and permanent as po&s;&s;ible. In concurrence with this care, and with whatever el&s;e prudence may dictate for our own pre&s;ervation, we may &s;eek, and hope to obtain, the protection and defence of the Almighty.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="021353_0019_0FB3196988C72970">
I may not put an end to this di&s;cour&s;e without ob|&s;erving, that as chri&s;tians we all &s;u&s;tain the character of &s;oldiers under Chri&s;t Je&s;us the Captain of our &s;alva|tion; and are engaged in a warfare again&s;t Sin and Satan, the pollutions that are in the world, and our own lu&s;ts. Expo&s;ed to the mo&s;t alarming dangers from the&s;e &s;piritual enemies, we infinitely need the defence of heavenly grace. This is promi&s;ed in the go&s;pel; but here as well as in what relates to our temporal &s;afety, we are to expect the fulfilment of the promi&s;e only in concurrence with our own exertions in <HI>&s;triving again&s;t &s;in,</HI> and <HI>fighting the good fight of faith.</HI> We are accordingly directed to <HI>put on the whole armour of God,</HI> and become expert in the u&s;e of our &s;piritual weapons. And in this way are encouraged to hope for victory and triumph, and to be brought off finally <HI>more than conquer|ours through him who hath loved us</HI>&mdash;and <HI>given him&s;elf for us&mdash;to whom be glory forever.</HI></P>
