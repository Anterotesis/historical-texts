<P>_TO teach the Art of War, is not the Office of the Mini&s;ters of the PRINCE OF PEACE: The Go&s;pel breathes the mo&s;t exten&s;ive Benevolence to Man|kind; and has the highe&s;t Tendency to unite all Nations of the Earth, in inviolable Friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>IT is our Departure from God, that renders us Enemies to one another: The extravagant Lu&s;ts of Men enkindle tho&s;e Fires of Contention, which con|&s;ume the Beauty of this lower Creation, and trans|form the Globe we inhabit into <HI>a Valley of Tears.</HI>&mdash; Did the Spirit of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> univer&s;ally prevail, it would &s;ubdue that Ambition and Avarice, which are the Source of &s;o many Mi&s;eries to a guilty World.&mdash;It would in&s;pire the Brea&s;ts of Princes with that di&s;|intere&s;ted Goodne&s;s, which would &s;oon diffu&s;e Order
<PB N="8" REF="007749_0005_102D72E7690CED28">
and Harmony, among the different Cantons of Man|kind.&mdash;Then the Arts of Peace would triumph over the Policies of War; the Fields of Death, &s;mile in all the unrifled Charms of Nature; and this di&s;or|dered Earth, become a <HI>Paradi&s;e</HI> of Beauty and Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>BUT &s;ince the happy Day is not yet come, when <HI>the Nations &s;hall beat their Swords into Plow-&s;hares, and their Spears into Pruning-hooks.</HI>&mdash; Since, in the Di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence, we hear <HI>the Sound of the Trumpet, and the Alarm of War;</HI> and are call'd to <HI>gird on the Sword, and prepare the In&s;truments of Battle.</HI>&mdash; It is becoming the Character of a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel, to &s;hew what Direction, Encourage|ment, and A&s;&s;i&s;tance, the <HI>Book of God</HI> affords us, on the&s;e melancholy Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>I am per&s;waded, none of my pre&s;ent Audience will que&s;tion, whether the Profe&s;&s;ion of a Soldier is con&s;i&s;tent with the Character of a Chri&s;tian: We know, that many of the Military Order, have, in all Ages, appear'd the &s;hining Ornaments of the Church of Chri&s;t, as well as the &s;tronge&s;t Bulwarks of civil Society: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>MANY of the fir&s;t Fathers of <HI>New-England,</HI> ju&s;tly de&s;erved this Character;&mdash;they were noble In&s;tances of &s;ublime Piety, and martial Accompli&s;hments. &mdash;they were equally qualified to adorn the Church by their exemplary Vertue, and defend it by their Valour.</P>
<P>PERHAPS the pre&s;ent Age has not produc'd a more truly Chri&s;|tian Hero, than the late Col. GARDINER, who maintain'd uninterrupted Communion with Heaven, amid&s;t the Tumults and Di&s;orders of a Camp&mdash;and after a Life &s;pent in perpetual Toils and Dangers, in the Service of his Country, &mdash;died in the Bed of Honor, fighting again&s;t the Enemies, of the civil and religious Liberties of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI>&mdash;I wi&s;h the Life of this devout Warrior, wrote by the late celebrated Dr. <HI>Doddridge,</HI> was in the Hands of all the Gentlemen of a Mi|litary Character. I am per&s;waded, it would afford them an agreable Entertainment, and the be&s;t In&s;truction.</P></NOTE> They have merited the public
<PB N="9" REF="007749_0006_102DA82361599900">
E&s;teem, as much by the Charms of their Vertue, as by the Splendor of their Conque&s;ts.</P>
<P>THE Great God, conde&s;cends to wear the Title of a MAN OF WAR; and Princes, His Vicegerents here below, are commanded, not to bear the Sword in vain.&mdash;When the Faith of Treaties is violated, the Rights of a Community invaded, all Propo&s;als of Accommodation ob&s;tinately rejected,&mdash;it becomes the immediate Duty of the &s;upreme Magi&s;trate, to have Recour&s;e to Arms; that he may e&s;tabli&s;h Peace, pro|tect Innocence, humble the Proud Oppre&s;&s;ors of the Earth, and put a Stop to the Progre&s;s of Tyranny and U&s;urpation.</P>
<P>THE only Que&s;tion is,&mdash; How we &s;hall behave, when call'd to War, &s;o as not to violate the Obliga|tion of our Chri&s;tian Profe&s;&s;ion, or injure the Rights of our fellow Creatures,&mdash;but maintain the Character of <HI>good Soldiers of Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> and &s;ucce&s;sful Ser|vants of the Common-wealth?&mdash;In this the Word of God is <HI>profitable to direct.</HI></P>
<P>THE Apo&s;tle cau&s;es the illu&s;trious Heroes of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Church, to pa&s;s in Review before us; and propo&s;es their noble Example, for the Imitation of the People of God in all Ages. By Faith, they pa&s;&s;ed thro' the &s;evere&s;t Trials, &s;urmounted the mo&s;t terrifying Dangers, <HI>waxed valiant in Fight, put to Flight the Armies of the Aliens.</HI></P>
<P>THE Apo&s;tle, in this Chapter, &s;peaks of <HI>Faith</HI> in the mo&s;t exten&s;ive Signification of the Word.&mdash;He intends that divine Principle, which inclines us to adore the Perfections of the infinite Deity, to re&s;ign our&s;elves to the Government of His Providence, to believe the Revelations of His Word, to depend on the Promi&s;es of his Grace, to obey his &s;overeign Or|ders,&mdash;in Times of the greate&s;t Difficulty and Dan|ger,&mdash;notwith&s;tanding the Terrors and Allurements of this <HI>pre&s;ent evil World.</HI>&mdash;This is that Faith which
<PB N="10" REF="007749_0007_102DA824E63DB410">
animated the&s;e ancient Worthies&punc; and enabled them to perform the&s;e mighty Exploits, which were the Glory of the pa&s;t, and will be the Admiration of future Ages. The &s;ame Faith &s;hould animate the Brea&s;ts of the military Gentlemen of the pre&s;ent Day, if they would receive the Honors&punc; and enjoy the Suc|ce&s;s of their illu&s;trious Predece&s;&s;ors. To &s;how</P>
<P>HOW admirably this Faith is calculated to produce this happy Effect, is the De&s;ign of my pre&s;ent Di&s;|cour&s;e. Faith teaches us to engage in War upon the noble&s;t Principles,&mdash;it inclines us to pro&s;ecute it with intrepid Valour,&mdash;It &s;ecures us the mo&s;t powerful A&s;&s;i&s;tance,&mdash;It promi&s;es us the mo&s;t glorious Reward. &mdash;This is the Plan of my Di&s;cour&s;e, the Subject of your &s;erious Attention.&mdash;</P>
<P>FIRST, Faith teaches us, to engage in War upon the noble&s;t Principles.</P>
<P>WHAT was the Spirit, that animated <HI>the Pompey</HI>'s&punc; <HI>and Cae&s;ar</HI>'s, and other celebrated Warriors of the Heathen World?&mdash; What is the Spirit, that animates many of our Modern Heroes?&mdash;Their Characters are &s;urrounded with a fal&s;e Blaze of Glory; their Names are tra&s;mitted to Po&s;terity, in flattering Titles of Honor; they are profanely &s;tiled invincible Con|querors, Arbiters of Peace and War, Di&s;po&s;ers of the Fate of Kingdoms.&mdash;Thus the Truth is di&s;gui&s;ed by their &s;ervile Dependants; and their &s;ecret De&s;igns conceal'd, by all the Refinements of Art and Elo|quence.&mdash;But if we examine their Conduct, with an unprejudiced Mind, we &s;hall immediately find, the fatal Influence of in&s;atiable Avarice,&mdash;in&s;olent Pride, &mdash;unbounded Ambition.</P>
<P>FAITH in&s;pires its Heroes with nobler Motives, agreable to the Dignity of human Nature, and the Sanctity of our Chri&s;tian Profe&s;&s;ion.&mdash;A &s;upreme Re|gard to the Glory of God, a &s;incere De&s;ire to e&s;tabli&s;h Peace among Mankind, a di&s;intere&s;ted Zeal for the
<PB N="11" REF="007749_0008_102DA826948BEB10">
publick Welfare&punc; influence their Conduct.&mdash;The Call of God&punc; and their Country&punc; brings them into the Field of Battle.&mdash;The Enemies they oppo&s;e&punc; are Pride, Perfidy, and Violence:&mdash;The&s;e they fight again&s;t without Revenge, conquer without Haughtine&s;s, tri|umph over without In&s;olence.&mdash;Undi&s;&s;embled Love reigns in their Brea&s;ts&punc; when engaged&punc; in the mo&s;t ter|rible Acts of publick Vengeance: Their Bowels melt, with the tendere&s;t Compa&s;&s;ion&punc; when their Hands are &s;tained with Blood: They devoutly adore the Creator, when obliged by &s;ad Nece&s;&s;ity to de&s;troy His Creatures.</P>
<P>THE Religion of JESUS teaches its faithful Di&s;|ciples, to do no Violence&punc; to advance their private In|tere&s;t&punc; to commit no Injury&punc; to increa&s;e the Lu&s;tre of their Reputation&punc; to &s;hed not a Drop of Blood, but what may be &s;erviceable to the Cau&s;e of Truth and Ju&s;tice &mdash; It requires us&punc; to endeavour to &s;ubdue our Enemies&punc; without de&s;troying them&punc; to re&s;i&s;t their ho&s;tile Attempts without violating the &s;acred Obliga|tions of Charity&punc; to reduce them to Rea&s;on, by Me|thods the lea&s;t &s;evere and angry &mdash;This is to act <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> OF JESUS CHRIST&punc; to obey the bene|volent Precepts of the GREAT CAPTAIN OF OUR SALVATION. When we engage in War, in this Di&s;|po&s;ition of Mind.</P>
<P>SECONDLY&punc; Faith enables us to pro&s;ecute it with intrepid Valor.</P>
<P>TRUE Valor. My Brethren&punc; is not an indi&s;creet Impetuo&s;ity, which hurries us into the greate&s;t Dan|gers, without Tho't; and ventures upon immediate Death&punc; without any Pro&s;pect of Advantage.&mdash; But a noble Greatne&s;s of Mind&punc; which inclines a Per&s;on to obey the Voice of God and His People, tho' it calls him to the mo&s;t dangerous Enterprizes: Its Ardor is increa&s;ed at the View of an Enemy&punc; It ri&s;es &s;uperi|or to every Difficulty, that is found in the Path of
<PB N="12" REF="007749_0009_102DA829B99D9688">
Duty; and is ready to &s;acrifice Life it&s;elf, rather than endanger the publick Safety.</P>
<P>THIS generous Fortitude never re&s;ides in the Brea&s;ts of the Wicked; the accu&s;tomed Practice of Vice de|&s;troys the Health of the Body, relaxes the Vigor of the Mind, makes Men capable only of mean and mercenary De&s;igns.</P>
<P>OF this, we have numberle&s;s Examples, in anci|ent and modern Hi&s;tory. While the <HI>Romans</HI> conti|nued uncorrupted, their Empire <HI>was &s;trong as Iron,</HI> according to the &s;ignificant Repre&s;entation of the Pro|phet <HI>Daniel.</HI>&mdash; The Severity of their Manners was the great Occa&s;ion of the Rapidity of their Conque&s;ts&mdash; The Grandeur of their Common-wealth was the Reward of their national Ju&s;tice and Temperence. But when their ancient Di&s;cipline was weakned; and the Vices of the conquered, corrupted the Hearts of the Conquerors&mdash;<HI>their Iron became,</HI> immediately min|gled <HI>with Clay</HI>&mdash;the Foundations of their Govern|ment were &s;oon overthrown, and their once victorious Legions, were ea&s;ily put to Flight, by Troops of undi&s;ciplin'd Barbarians.</P>
<P>NOW, the Principles of the Chri&s;tian Faith pre|&s;erve us from tho&s;e Vices, which deprave the &s;ound Con&s;titution both of Body and Mind; and transform valiant Heroes, into effeminate Cowards.&mdash; It e&s;tab|li&s;hes that &s;trict Government of the Pa&s;&s;ions, <HI>which is Health to the Navel, and Marrow to the Bones;</HI> and naturally forms us to every great and good De&s;ign.</P>
<P>UNDER the Influence of this Faith, the Chri&s;tian Soldier begins his Days with Prayer&mdash;exerci&s;es his Authority to &s;uppre&s;s the Prevalence of Vice&mdash;em|ploys his Power to protect the Liberties of Mankind. He invocates in every Danger the God of Armies; and &s;anctifies the Violence of War, by the Purity of his Intentions, and the De&s;ire to procure an happy Peace.</P>

I will not fear:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P&s;al.</HI> 118.6.</NOTE> <HI>What can Man do unto me?

<P>THIRDLY, Faith &s;ecures us the mo&s;t powerful A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>IT is the Wi&s;dom of all Nations, to form a potent Alliance when engaging in War. Well cemented Confederacies, have a natural Influence to &s;ecure Succe&s;s to our Enterprizes. When different Nations join in Concert for their mutual Defence, and act with united Vigor; it makes the proud Oppre&s;&s;ors of the Earth to tremble, and their royal Diadems totter on their Heads.</P>
<P>BUT after all, it mu&s;t be acknowleded the Events of War are uncertain: the mo&s;t wi&s;e and valiant
<PB N="14" REF="007749_0011_102DA82DCDF034F0">
Captains are not always crown'd with Victory, nor the mo&s;t numerous and be&s;t di&s;ciplin'd Troops fa|voured with Succe&s;s. <HI>The Race is not to the Swift, nor the Battle to the Strong. No King is &s;aved by the Multitude of an Ho&s;t, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> it a mighty Man de|livered by much Strength.</HI> The &s;upreme Monarch of the Univer&s;e, directs the Fate of War according to His &s;overeign and irre&s;i&s;table Plea&s;ure.&mdash;It is equally ea&s;y with Him, to &s;ave by many or by few.</P>
<P>IT is, therefore, the highe&s;t Wi&s;dom to engage the <HI>Lord of Ho&s;ts</HI> on our Side, and the Extremity of Folly to provoke Him to undertake the Cau&s;e of our Enemies. Now nothing is more acceptable to Him, than a firm Dependance on his Power&mdash;Provi|dence&mdash; and Grace.&mdash; This is the Practice of the Chri&s;tian Warrior, and the &s;ure Way to Pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>THE Wicked bid Defiance to Heaven&punc; even when they &s;tand in the greate&s;t Need of its A&s;&s;i&s;tance &mdash; they affront the <HI>God of Battles</HI>&punc; when &s;urrounded with the dreadful <HI>Artillery</HI> of His Wrath.&mdash;They depend on the Number of their Forces, the Valor of their Troops, the Depth of their Stratagems&punc; to &s;ecure them the Fortune of the Day.&mdash; If they con|quer, it is a&s;crib'd to their &s;uperior Strength and Wi&s;|dom. They erect Altars to their own Glory, and burn Incen&s;e to their Ambition and Vanity.</P>
<P>BUT, Faith teaches the Followers of Chri&s;t to renounce all Self-dependance: to fix their Expecta|tions upon the &s;upreme Di&s;po&s;er of all Things, and to give the Glory of all their Succe&s;s to Him, to whom it ju&s;tly belongs.&mdash;If they march, they look to God their Director and Guide.&mdash; If they encamp&punc; they know except God be their Protector, the <HI>Watch|men wake in vain.</HI>&mdash; If they fight, they are &s;en&s;ible from whence they derive all their military Strength. If they Conquer, they acknowledge that divine Hand, which alone crowns them with Victory and Triumph.</P>

It is to be fear'd, that many of the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful Captains in modern Times, have been influenc'd by no higher Motives in their military Atchievements.&mdash;When this is the Ca&s;e, we erect Monuments to perpetuate the Re|membrance of their Victories, but cannot enroll them among the Favourites of Heaven. While we cele|brate their martial Honours, we &s;hed Tears to think, that tho&s;e who have &s;o nobly &s;erv'd the Purpo&s;es of divine Providence, mu&s;t remain the eternal Objects of His Ju&s;tice.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="007749_0015_102DA836B8A53C68">WHAT is this Fame! &s;o ardently de&s;ired, &s;o impa|tiently pur&s;ued,&mdash;amid&s;t a Thou&s;and Deaths &mdash;thro' ten Thou&s;and Dangers!&mdash; An airy Dream&mdash;A gilded Phantom&mdash;de&s;titute of Truth and Reality.</P>
<P>BUT the Chri&s;tian Soldier, animated with the Spirit of Faith and Charity, fights not for a Crown of fading Lawrels, but uncorruptible Glory; He receives the Applau&s;es, not of fal&s;e and flattering Mortals, but of God the true Fountain of Honor.</P>
<P>ASCEND, O Chri&s;tian! above the&s;e Objects of Sen&s;e which &s;urround you; fix your Thoughts on the ETERNAL DIVINITY: Behold him &s;eated on a <HI>Throne of Light,</HI> encircled with Angels, Arch-Angels, and the whole HIERARCHY OF HEAVEN&mdash;Hark,&mdash; how loud do their Triumphant Voices &s;ound!&mdash; with what tran&s;ports of Joy do they a&s;cribe.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rev.</HI> 7.12.</NOTE> <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing and Glory, and Honor and Power to our God forever and ever!</HI></P>
<P>YET&punc; a little while, O Chri&s;tian Soldier! and you &s;hall be united to this &s;hining A&s;&s;embly, partake of their Joys, and join in their uncea&s;ing HALLELUJAHS. After you have fought under the Banners OF THE CROSS, your appointed Time; Death &s;hall give the <HI>final Di&s;charge:</HI> Whether you fall by the Stroke of Violence in the Field of Battle; or de&s;cend to the Grave, in the common Cour&s;e of Nature; your immortal Spirit, &s;hall be &s;afely convey'd to the <HI>Pa|radi&s;e</HI> of God.</P>
<P>THERE&mdash;the great CAPTAIN OF OUR SALVATION, &s;hall addre&s;s you in the Language of ineffable Grace, <HI>Well done thou good and faithful Servant.</HI>&mdash;There&mdash; He will fulfil that Promi&s;e, which he now makes to

all his loyal and obedient Subjects. <HI>To him that overcometh,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rev.</HI> 3.21.</NOTE> <HI>will I grant to &s;it with me in my Throne, even as I al&s;o overcame, and am &s;et down with my Father in His Throne.</HI></P>
<P>WHAT is there, my Brethren, in the loud Applau&s;es of the Age&mdash;in the magnificent Trophies of human Vanity&mdash;in the &s;parkling Diadems of Princes; that can be compar'd to the &s;olid Honors, which are ap|pointed for the Chri&s;tian Hero, and the Crowns of Glory which are prepared for them in a future World.</P>
<P>IT remains, that I apply this Di&s;cour&s;e to the <HI>Gentlemen in Arms,</HI> at who&s;e Invitation we are now a&s;&s;embled in the Hou&s;e of God.</P>
<P>GENTLEMEN OF THE ARTILLERY,</P>
<P>YOU appear, in the united Characters of <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> and <HI>Soldiers</HI>&mdash;Characters of Honor and U&s;efulne&s;s, which render you in an high Degree the Glory and Safety of the Community. The De&s;ign of the In|&s;titution of your ancient and honourable Company, was not barely to qualify you to make an hand&s;ome Figure upon the <HI>Parade,</HI> and handle your Arms with Dexterity and Addre&s;s in a <HI>Review:</HI> But that you might be di&s;tingui&s;h'd Proficients in the <HI>military Art,</HI> and fit to lead on <HI>the Armies of I&s;rael</HI> to Battle, when the Defence of your Country &s;hall &s;ummon you to Action.</P>
<P>IF ever this Land &s;tood in Need of wi&s;e and va|liant Commanders, it is in the pre&s;ent Day.&mdash;Was there ever a Time, when we were encompa&s;s'd on all Sides, with &s;uch Numbers of Enemies?&mdash;Was there ever a Time, when &s;uch &s;hocking Cruelties were

<P>NO &s;ooner was Peace proclaim'd, but <HI>France</HI> imme|diately prepar'd for the Commencement of a new War, the fir&s;t favourable Opportunity; and fix'd upon <HI>North-America</HI> to be the Scene of its earlie&s;t Triumphs.
