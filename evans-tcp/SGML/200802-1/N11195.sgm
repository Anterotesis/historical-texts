<Q><BIBL>Malachi, III Chap. 1, 2. Ver.</BIBL>
<P>Behold I will &s;end my Me&s;&s;enger, and he &s;hall pre|pare the way before me: And the Lord whom ye &s;eek &s;hall &s;uddenly come to his temple, even the Me&s;|&s;enger of the Covenant whom ye delight in: Behold, he &s;hall come, &s;aith the Lord of Ho&s;ts.</P>
<P>But who may abide the day of his coming? And who &s;hall &s;tand when He appeareth? For He is like a refiner's fire and like fuller's &s;oap.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE two fir&s;t chapters of this prophecy contain a reproof of the ingratitude of the children of I&s;rael, and the contempt which they ca&s;t upon God in their &s;acrifices. The aggravation of their &s;in aro&s;e from the pecu|liar favour and goodne&s;s of heaven to their nati|on, in placing them above the re&s;t of mankind, by the enjoyment of &s;pecial privileges.</P>
<P>The prie&s;thood incurred reproach by a ba&s;e per|ver&s;ion of their office and the introduction of manifold corruptions into divine wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>Their violation of the covenant of Levi, provo|ked God to render them contemptible before all the people: They were impoveri&s;hed and became de&s;picable among their brethren, by the neglect of
<PB N="6" REF="014172_0005_0F9332F565D7C268">
the tribes in withholding their tithes and offerings. From cen&s;uring the Levites the Prophet proceeds to reprove the other inhabitants of Jeru&s;alem for their intermarriages with &s;trangers, and for vio|lating the covenant with their lawful wives: hereby they were &s;educed into idolatry and all the abominations of the heathen, whom the Lord had ca&s;t out before the face of their fathers.</P>
<P>The Jews wearied God with their impatience and murmuring complaints.</P>
<P>They looked carefully for the promi&s;ed Me&s;&s;iah, a Prince to ari&s;e up in the family of David to be their deliverer out of all their afflictions, and to exalt them high above the nations. They im|peached the divine goodne&s;s for delaying this di&s;tingui&s;hing benefit to them, and &s;aid, 'Where is the God of Judgment'. Or wherefore doth not the ju&s;t God fulfil his promi&s;es, and &s;end us deli|verance? Hereby they di&s;covered their di&s;tru&s;t of the divine faithfulne&s;s; and they wearied God with their infidelity and &s;u&s;picious jealou&s;y of his pow|er and goodne&s;s. But in&s;tead of cha&s;tizing them, as their impatient murmurings had merited, God &s;ent his Prophet with a new and merciful predicti|on of Chri&s;t's coming, and the &s;igns and manner thereof. This prophecy begins with our Text. In treating of which I &s;hall attempt</P>
<P>I. A brief explanation of the &s;everal di&s;tinct parts thereof&mdash;And then,</P>
<P>II. Dwell upon &s;ome general truths contained therein, with more particular attention. And,</P>
<P>I. Let us attend to a brief explanation of the &s;everal di&s;tinct parts of the text.</P>
<P>The Prophet u&s;hers in his gracious prediction with the word, "Behold", thereby challenging the attention of his countrymen to &s;omething wor|thy
<PB N="7" REF="014172_0006_0F9332F59F2A8BD0">
their highe&s;t notice and regard. "I will &s;end" I the Lord Je&s;us, who am the author of this pro|mi&s;e, by the mouth of my Prophet, "will &s;end". Chri&s;t is the &s;ource of all benefits to the church. "My me&s;&s;enger." Chri&s;t's me&s;&s;enger or the fore|runner who proclaimed his approach, was John the Bapti&s;t. "And he &s;hall prepare the way be|fore me". This did the Bapti&s;t, by preaching re|pentance unto I&s;rael for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins. He enjoined renunciation of all their iniquities as a nece&s;&s;ary preparation for the reception of the Me&s;&s;iah, upon his public manife&s;tation to the world. He preached that the kingdom of heaven was at hand.&mdash;"And the Lord, whom ye &s;eek, &s;hall &s;ud|denly come to his temple". In about &s;ix months after the Bapti&s;t's preaching, Chri&s;t was made ma|nife&s;t, and anointed publickly by the Holy Gho&s;t, to his work. In the days of our Prophet the people lamented the inferiority of the &s;econd tem|ple to that which was builded by Solomon; yet he lets them know for their con&s;olation, that it &s;hould become illu&s;trious, by the per&s;onal appear|ance of our Lord therein; agreable to the words of the Prophet Haggai. "And I will &s;hake all nations, and the de&s;ire of all nations &s;hall come: and I will fill this hou&s;e with glory, &s;aith the Lord of Ho&s;ts. The glory of this latter hou&s;e &s;hall be greater than the former, &s;aith the Lord of Ho&s;ts"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hag. chap. 2. ver. 7, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> The temple of Chri&s;t extends not only to the tem|ple at Jeru&s;alem, but likewi&s;e to the go&s;pel church, which is frequently &s;tiled, "His temple", and, "the temple of the living God". Chri&s;t will always protect his church; he will not long ab&s;ent him|&s;elf therefrom. Altho' for their declen&s;ion he may vi&s;ibly hide his face and withdraw &s;ome of
<PB N="8" REF="014172_0007_0F9332F6A70FF060">
his &s;pecial favours for a &s;ea&s;on, yet he will not long delay his coming: He will never leave nor for&s;ake them; he will return upon the wings of his love: He will not tarry, but come "&s;udden|ly", "even the me&s;&s;enger of the covenant&punc; whom ye delight in." Chri&s;t is the great Prophet of his people and the head of the covenant of Grace; and he will not be negligent in bearing me&s;&s;ages of peace to the church. He will be faithful and active in his work. The expre&s;&s;ions, "whom ye &s;eek, and whom ye delight in," evidence, that at all times there are &s;ome who are in a mea&s;ure faithful to the Saviour, who rejoice in his pre&s;ence, and earne&s;tly look for his return and abode in his church or temple.&mdash;"Behold he &s;hall come, &s;aith the Lord of Ho&s;ts". The promi&s;e is repeated with the mo&s;t &s;olemn a&s;&s;urances to &s;trengthen our con|fidence therein. The Father hath promi&s;ed by his great Name, that Chri&s;t &s;hall return to his peo|ple. That &s;o they might have a &s;trong con&s;ola|tion, &s;ince it is impo&s;&s;ible for God to lie.</P>
<P>"But, who may abide the day of his coming?" However we are a&s;&s;ured; that the me&s;&s;enger of the covenant will come; yet it will frequently be with his terrible Maje&s;ty; in the way of &s;evere Judg|ments: He will cha&s;ti&s;e his heritage for their apo&s;tacies; and &s;end the mo&s;t fearful calamities upon the wicked, who de&s;ire not the Saviour's ap|pearance. "God will &s;hake nations, when the de|&s;ire of all nations &s;hall come." The hearts of ma|ny may fail them: Many may fall away in the tribulation of tho&s;e days: The cau&s;e may at times appear de&s;perate, and there may be an almo&s;t total defection; &s;ome may be brought to death in the terrible conflict: "For there &s;hall be di&s;tre&s;s of nations; the waves and &s;ea roring." The Lord
<PB N="9" REF="014172_0008_0F9332F71C54E630">
&s;hall break forth in his glory, from a dark and pitchy Cloud.&mdash;"And who &s;hall &s;tand when he appear|eth?" Who &s;hall per&s;evere in the mid&s;t of the&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;es? Who &s;hall maintain their integrity? who be found faithful to the end? The Prophet's words intimate, that very few would &s;tand the tri|al. "For he is like a refiner's fire, and like fuller's &s;oap." Fire is for the purification of metals. Silver and Gold are ca&s;t thereinto to burn up the dro&s;s. The fuller's &s;oap is u&s;ed to take out the &s;pots in cloaths and garments. Gold is ca&s;t into the furnace, into the extremity of heat, before the alloy, the re|probate metals are con&s;umed; when it returns, it comes forth pure gold. And likewi&s;e cloaths go through a &s;evere purification before all the blem|i&s;hes are wa&s;hed away. Chri&s;t is like this fire and &s;oap; he rai&s;es the fire of affliction and per&s;ecution to purge away the &s;ins of his people. Many are wa&s;hed away in the filth: Many are con&s;umed with the dro&s;s. God's children are &s;everely tried: Many of their darling &s;ins are burnt up. He con|&s;umes in them, the wood, the hay and the &s;tub|ble: Things very precious to them. They are often feeble and &s;ore-broken under divine judg|ments, and are ready to cry out with the P&s;al|mi&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. 74. 1.</NOTE>, "O God, why ha&s;t thou ca&s;t us off fore|ver? why doth thine anger &s;moke again&s;t the &s;heep of thy pa&s;ture?" Chri&s;t comes "with the fan in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor: He &s;hall gather the wheat into his garner, and burn up the chaff with unquenchable Fire."</P>
<P>Thus I have explained each part of our text &s;e|parately. Let us &s;ee how the promi&s;e which is twice repeated with &s;o much &s;olemnity, was fulfil|led, as it referred immediately to the Jews&mdash;In due

time, John the Bapti&s;t, our Lord's forerunner, preached in the de&s;ert of Judea the bapti&s;m of re|pentance for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luk. 3.</NOTE> He cried &s;ay|ing, prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths &s;traight. He warned the people, that the Kingdom of Heaven was at hand. And accor|dingly, while he was fulfilling his cour&s;e, Chri&s;t came and was baptized of him in Jordan, and &s;et up his public admini&s;trations. He came with Pow|er and Authority. His doctrines were unexpec|ted. He had his fan in his hand. He ca&s;t off the Scribes and Phari&s;ees and Jewi&s;h doctors: di&s;ap|pointed their fond hopes of di&s;tinction: He refu|&s;ed to a&s;&s;ociate with them. He cho&s;e his fol|lowers among the de&s;pi&s;ed and rejected of the na|tion. The&s;e were led into &s;uch tribulation, that their hearts mi&s;gave them, and finally when the me&s;&s;enger of the covenant was cut off in the mid&s;t of his week, they all for&s;ook him and fled. And after his Re&s;urrection, the church was be&s;et with all the malice of a rancorous and per&s;ecu|ting zeal. They were murdered; they were di&s;|per&s;ed; they were wa&s;ted and laid mo&s;t de&s;olate, until the iniquities of their per&s;ecutors were full. Then Chri&s;t came in fearful Judgments to avenge his Blood and the Blood of his Martyrs, and the breach of his covenant.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mat. 24.&mdash;Luk. 21.</NOTE> There were wars and rumours of wars. Nation ro&s;e again Nation, and Kingdom again&s;t Kingdom; there were Famines and Pe&s;tilences, and Earthquakes, in divers places; and &s;uch tribulation as was not from the begin|ning of the world, even unto that time; no, nor ever &s;hall be. And had not God &s;hortned tho&s;e days, no fle&s;h would have been &s;aved; but for the Elect's &s;ake, he &s;hortened them.&mdash;<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jo&s;ephus,</NOTE> There were

The&s;e were but the beginnings of &s;orrows, a prelude to that awful and final exci&s;ion which they &s;uffered at the hands of Titus&mdash;Thus did the me&s;&s;enger of the covenant come to his temple; to protect his church, and to execute wrath upon his enemies. Thus was he a Refiner's Fire, and Fuller's Soap, And how few did abide the day of his coming? or &s;tand when he appeared? But let us now pa&s;s on,</P>
<P>II. To con&s;ider of &s;ome of the more general truths in our text.</P>
<P>We are thence taught;</P>
<P>I. That Chri&s;t will defend his church.</P>
<P>He came into the world a me&s;&s;enger of the co|venant: And his covenant will he keep with his people. And he hath the &s;ecurity of the Father's promi&s;e.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. 89. 29&mdash;35.</NOTE> His &s;eed al&s;o will I make to endure for|ever, and his throne as the days of Heaven. If his children for&s;ake my law, and walk not in my Judgments; if they break my &s;tatutes, and keep not my commandments; then will I vi&s;it their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion with the rod, and their iniquities with &s;tripes. Neverthele&s;s, my loving kindne&s;s will I not utterly take from him, nor &s;uffer my faithful|ne&s;s to fail. Once have I &s;worn by my Holine&s;s, that I will not lie unto David. And our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, when he was parting from his Apo&s;tles, after his Re&s;urrection, to revive their drooping &s;pirits under the pre&s;&s;ure of his ab&s;ence, gives them this refre&s;hing cordial<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mat. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">0.</NOTE> "Lo, I am with you al|way, even unto the end of the world". By this
<PB N="12" REF="014172_0011_0F9332F9505CA8E0">
we have a&s;&s;urance, that at all times, and to the end of time, God will have a true mini&s;try, and a true church. Although he may in a mea&s;ure for&s;ake them for a little &s;ea&s;on, yet he will return; he will return &s;uddenly. The gates of hell &s;hall not pre|vail. At times, the church may decline; and God may frown: His people may go about the city &s;eeking him whom their &s;oul loveth: They may en|tertain fears left he may have departed to vi&s;it them no more. "But their beloved &s;hall make ha&s;te, and be like to a roe, or to a young hart, upon the mountains of &s;pices".<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Solomon's Song.</NOTE> Chri&s;t will vi&s;ibly maintain his church wherein his wor&s;hip and ordinances &s;hall be regularly admini&s;tred. Although after repeated provocations, and long-&s;uffering forbear|ance, he may ca&s;t off a particular people; yet he will direct his mini&s;ters to turn to other nations; and he will be found of them which &s;ought not after him. We may never di&s;tru&s;t the divine pro|mi&s;e, "For the Lord whom ye &s;eek &s;hall &s;uddenly come to his temple, even the me&s;&s;enger of the co|venant, whom ye delight in; behold he &s;hall come, &s;aith the Lord of Ho&s;ts." Again,</P>
<P>II. God will be &s;ought unto, that he may come and vi&s;it his church.</P>
<P>"The Lord whom ye &s;eek; the me&s;&s;enger of the covenant whom ye delight in". Agreable to the&s;e words, we read that before the coming of our Saviour, there were &s;ome who were devoted to his &s;ervice, who earne&s;tly looked for his appear|ing. Chri&s;t's forerunner prepared the hearts of &s;everal for his reception. Among others, there was good old Simcon, who waited for the con&s;olation of I&s;rael. And there was Anna, of the tribe of A&s;her, "who departed not from the tem|ple,
<PB N="13" REF="014172_0012_0F9332FA26ADCF48">
but &s;erved God with fa&s;tings and prayers night and day". The&s;e &s;ought the Lord and according to their de&s;ires they were permitted to depart in peace: "For their eyes had &s;een his &s;alvation".<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luk. 2.</NOTE> In every dark period of the church there are &s;ome names which are found faithful; who are con|&s;tantly waiting upon God with an humble, firm confidence in his goodne&s;s, and merciful de&s;igns to his church. He expects his people to wait thus patiently upon him, and acknowledge him as the only repairer of breaches, who can re&s;tore again their wa&s;te and de&s;olate places. When God was about to vi&s;it his people I&s;rael with the mo&s;t pre|cious temporal and &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings, he &s;ays, "I will yet for this be enquired of, by the hou&s;e of I&s;rael to do it for them".<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ezek. 36. 37.</NOTE> Before Chri&s;t's merciful re|turn to vi&s;it his heritage, he &s;ends down his holy Spirit into the hearts of his children, to excite lon|ging de&s;ires after his gracious approach. The mo|tives of our Lord's return to his temple, after the primary de&s;ign of di&s;playing the divine Glory, are the tears and &s;upplications of his people.</P>
<P>III. Chri&s;t frequently comes to his church in the Maje&s;ty of Judgments.</P>
<P>When his &s;pecial pre&s;ence has been for a &s;ea|&s;on withdrawn, his church grows corrupt. Ma|ny unworthy practices and many unworthy pro|fe&s;&s;ors creep in. His children become loo&s;e and negligent in their lives, and bring di&s;honour up|on his name and ordinances. After a &s;eries of mercies, they are often remi&s;s in their walk; re|turn again to the pollutions of the world; and are proud and forgetful of the rock of their &s;alva|tion. Thus they tarni&s;h the beauty of the tem|ple and give occa&s;ion to the enemies of the Lord
<PB N="14" REF="014172_0013_0F9332FADD0B70A8">
to bla&s;pheme; to de&s;pi&s;e God; and refu&s;e his wor&s;hip. Hereby he is lightly &s;poken of by tho&s;e who are without. Chri&s;t therefore comes with the fan in his hand; to purge his church; to &s;epa|rate between the precious and the vile; the gold and the dro&s;s. He &s;ends his judgments abroad in the earth, that men may learn righteou&s;ne&s;s,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai, 26. 9.</NOTE> God's children are cha&s;tized for for&s;aking him, for their worldline&s;s; for their pride and carnal &s;ecurity. The dead, formal and hypocritical, he will by his great &s;everity bring to &s;ubmit to his righteou&s;ne&s;s, or otherwi&s;e burn them in the fire of his jealou&s;y, and con&s;ume them as the alloy in the refining of &s;ilver. To effect the&s;e holy purpo|&s;es the church is ca&s;t into tribulation; and this will often bring on apo&s;tacies, whereby the cor|rupt are through fear or malice induced to for|&s;ake the congregation of God's people; or God's people are induced to for&s;ake the wicked. Here by the ends of divine judgments are more effectu|ally an&s;wered. Tho&s;e who have not the root of grace abiding in them, are ready to apo&s;tatize from the truth, when they can thereby e&s;cape &s;ome temporal calamity, or &s;ecure any con&s;iderable good. This method therefore God adopts to prove men, whether or not his fear be in them; whether they can &s;tand the te&s;t of the fire, and come forth pure gold.</P>
<P>Another de&s;ign of Providence herein, is &s;uita|bly to humble a people, and fit them rightly to prize the favour and protection of heaven. Good obtained through &s;uffering, is much the mo&s;t de|light&s;ome. And when judgments proceed mer|cies, God's children will become truly dependant, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive and thankful to him. They who have the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed reward are tho&s;e who have
<PB N="15" REF="014172_0014_0F9332FBA86946A0">
come out of great tribulation. The&s;e have white robes, and palms in their hands, the en&s;igns of their victory.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. 7. 9.</NOTE> There are, therefore many weighty and nece&s;&s;ary rea&s;ons why Chri&s;t in a time of deep declen&s;ion, &s;hould come to his church in the way of judgments. The mo&s;t excellent de&s;ign hereof is, "That he may purify the &s;ons of Levi, and ren|der the offering of Judah and Jeru&s;alem plea&s;ant unto the Lord"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Context ver. 3, 4.</NOTE> Again,</P>
<P>IV. It is high matter of comfort in the mid&s;t of &s;evere trials, that God often graciou&s;ly appears for his church in the way Judgment.</P>
<P>Were divine judgments always a token of God's leaving his church and people, believers and all others, would be ca&s;t into a mo&s;t dreadful plunge upon the approach of calamity. But the hi&s;tory of divine providence &s;hews that God is a|ver&s;e from giving up his people; that his correc|tions are very commonly the &s;tripes of a Father: And that nothing but a &s;eries of ob&s;tinate rebelli|on again&s;t repeated mercies and cha&s;ti&s;ements, will induce him to ca&s;t off forever. Therefore when his judgments are abroad, we may hope that it is, that the inhabitants of the world may learn righ|teou&s;ne&s;s<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. 26. 9.</NOTE> That he is endeavouring to reclaim and bring to repentance a revolting people. Al|though judgments are an invariable &s;ign of &s;ome wrong conduct; yet the faithful are allowed, yea it is their bounden duty to hope, that Chri&s;t is coming to his church to purify it; to purge away the tin, and clean&s;e it from wrinkles and blemi&s;hes: That he is acting the refiner, and the fuller, and is determined to &s;anctify unto him&s;elf a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="014172_0015_0F9332FC4C8B9BE0">
When therefore God's arm is &s;tretched out, let repentance mitigate his anger, and hope e&s;tabli&s;h the &s;oul, that good days are yet to come, when he hath &s;ufficiently purified the hou&s;e of Levi and the hou&s;e of Judah. It is high ground of joy and thankfulne&s;s, that he who is head over all things for the church, over-rules every affliction and di&s;|tre&s;s for his own glory, in the peace and enlarg|ment of his heritage.</P>
<P>I have concluded the general truths which I purpo&s;ed to con&s;ider from the text; I proceed to apply them.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P>U&s;e 1. It is of infinite importance to every of us to be prepared in this day of declen&s;ion, for the coming and appearance of our Lord to his church.</P>
<P>The Prophet who wrote our text, gives us an example in &s;ome who lived in a &s;ea&s;on of dege|neracy. "Then they that feared the Lord &s;pake often one to another; and the Lord hearkened, and heard it: And a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his name. And they &s;hall be mine, &s;aith the Lord of ho&s;ts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will &s;pare them as a man &s;pareth his own &s;on that &s;erveth him"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mal. 3. 16, 17.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>We &s;hall all be &s;peedily called to meet our Lord in the way of death; if not in his judgments in this world. It is highly important therefore, that we have our lamps trimmed and burning, with oil therein, that we may be ready to go forth at any watch in the night. And be&s;ide, tho&s;e who live in &s;uch a &s;ea&s;on of declen&s;ion as the pre&s;ent, may be called to &s;evere trials of their faith in this life.
<PB N="17" REF="014172_0016_0F9332FD13FA0B50">
It is, therefore, no &s;mall thing which I enjoin, that we gird up the loins of our minds, and pre|pare for the conflict. God may prove us, whe|ther we be wheat or chaff; whether we be refi|ned or reprobate &s;ilver. We may be called to &s;haking and perplexity of nations; to the waves and &s;ea roring. He who &s;tandeth upon the cir|cuit of eternity, alone knows the events which await us. It is certainly our duty and intere&s;t to be up, and preparing for the wor&s;t: And this, by every man's mourning for his own &s;ins; reforming his life; putting on faith, patience, fortitude; and by a good example, and pious con|ver&s;ation, commending repentance and reformation to all about him. It would be a mo&s;t deplorable condition, for any of us, to be marked out as the objects of divine wrath, as the dro&s;s, which Chri&s;t &s;hall purge from his church. Apo&s;tacy is a fear|ful judgment: Nothing is more to be deprecated than falling beneath God's hand, when it is lifted up for the correction of his heritage. Let us there|fore be in readine&s;s, that we be not &s;urprized into any thing di&s;honorable to our&s;elves, or our chri&s;|tian profe&s;&s;ion. In tho&s;e who are fitted for the conflict, it &s;hall only burn up the wood, hay and &s;tubble; the gold, &s;ilver, and precious &s;tones &s;hall remain. Therefore &s;et each one him&s;elf upon im|mediate and diligent preparation.</P>
<P>U&s;e 2. We have abundant rea&s;on to think, that as he hath already appeared &s;o, the Lord purpo&s;es hereafter to come to his church in this land, with &s;evere Judgments.</P>
<P>We cannot, nor dare we deny that we have grie|vou&s;ly apo&s;tatized from the God of our fore-fathers. The &s;tory of our obligations to heaven, for merciful interpo&s;itions, would exceed the limits of this di&s;|cour&s;e.

To forget a God, who hath &s;o wonder|fully &s;aved us, and enlarged our borders, and given us &s;uch precious priviledges in this good and large land, is ba&s;e ingratitude, and merits his cha&s;|ti&s;ing rod. Accordingly, he hath holden it over us, and threatens &s;till further to puni&s;h our back|&s;liding. It is no le&s;s a calamity, than an evidence of our &s;in, that his holy &s;pirit hath &s;o vi&s;ibly de|parted from us, in his gracious operations upon the hearts of men. Added to our guilt, we have fur|ther evidences of God's purpo&s;e to afflict and pu|rify us.</P>
<P>He hath &s;uffered among&s;t us luxury, lu&s;t and di&s;&s;ipation. And he hath likewi&s;e, as a righteous puni&s;hment of our di&s;obedience to his laws, rai|&s;ed up adver&s;aries again&s;t this land. Men who have had de&s;igns of their own, incompatible with the general intere&s;ts of the Briti&s;h empire, moved with a jealou&s;y of the liberties of the American Colonies, which &s;tand &s;o much in the way of their ambition, have, by the &s;ufferance of God's holy providence, been able to procure mea&s;ures, wholly repugnant to the civil rights of the inhabitants of this country. The Briti&s;h admini&s;tration by the force of great abilities, perverted to ba&s;e purpo&s;es, and by their command of the national trea&s;ure, have influenced the Parliament to enact the mo&s;t grie|vous edicts again&s;t us. Laws made, with the feigned pretence of protecting and &s;ecuring us, and for the &s;upport of civil government, have been the mo&s;t direct inva&s;ion of our property, and &s;ubver&s;ive of every idea of Engli&s;h freedom.</P>

Ad|ded to this, they have in a great mea&s;ure taken away the chartered rights of this province, which hath as ju&s;t claims to their favour and protection, as any of her &s;i&s;ter colonies on the Continent. They have made unju&s;t alterations in the cour&s;e of civil trials; and given the governor a power as exorbitant, as that of a general at the head of his army in time of war. They have annihilated one branch of our legi&s;lative council: And by the regulations re&s;pecting Town Meetings, laid a mo&s;t cruel burden upon all our towns, and extended without limitation, the boundaries of the Gover|nor's authority. You may not repair an high|way without his permi&s;&s;ion. But what is the wor&s;t part of the whole, they have put the reli|gious e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Province into his hand.

Not a &s;ingle example is pretended to be alledged, wherein the A&s;&s;embly have ever cho&s;en a Member, whom they had not a right to elect, and who was not qualified by Char|ter to be one of the Board. Nor have they pointed out any in&s;tances of their Male Admini&s;tration.

Although we are great &s;inners, yet by repentance, and tru&s;t in God, we may hope, that he will deliver us.&mdash;For as to men, our cau&s;e is <HI>good.</HI> Our adver&s;aries have been the <HI>Aggre&s;&s;ors.</HI> Our burdens are likewi&s;e great, and threatning; and to the cries of tho&s;e, who are groaning under &s;uch heavy afflictions, the ears of the Lord of Sabbaoth, are ever open. Chri&s;t will maintain his Church: He will glorify his long|&s;uffering towards it. And as the Go&s;pel hath not been continued to this country, &s;o long as he is wont to continue it with a profe&s;&s;ing people; and as the method of divine Providence, is to grant a &s;eries of mercies and judgments, for the trial and reformation of his covenant people, &s;o we may &s;till humbly hope that the Lord will yet again return to his temple in this land. As public religion can|not flouri&s;h without civil liberty; &s;o God will a|gain re&s;tore us to our rights.</P>

Further to e&s;tabli&s;h a firm reliance upon heaven, I might point you to various nations, much weak|er than we are, and a&s;&s;aulted by foes no le&s;s pow|erful, who by the goodne&s;s of God, have been the &s;ucce&s;sful maintainers of their privileges. As a &s;pecimen of many others, take the following ex|amples.</P>
<P>When I&s;rael was greatly impoveri&s;hed, becau&s;e of the Midianites, and cried unto the Lord, the Lord heard them, and rai&s;ed up Gideon to be their &s;aviour. And he blew a trumpet, and the people were gathered after him. But when the people were too many for the Lord to deliver the Midi|anites into their hands, he cho&s;e out from among&s;t them three hundred men. With the&s;e Gideon came upon the Midianites and the Amalekites, and the children of the ea&s;t country who lay along the valley, like gra&s;shoppers for multitude, and their camels were without number, as the &s;and of the &s;ea &s;hore for multitude.</P>
<P>And they cried, "the &s;word of the Lord and of Gideon." And the Lord &s;et every man's &s;word a|gain&s;t his fellow, even throughout all the ho&s;t; and they were overthrown with a very great &s;laughter. Thus was Midian &s;ubdued before I&s;|rael, &s;o that they lifted up their heads no more. And the country was in quietne&s;s forty years.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Judges 6, 7, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> 8. Chap</NOTE></P>
<P>After Nehemiah had obtained a decree from the King of Per&s;ia, to rebuild the walls of Jeru&s;alem, and had &s;et forward the work; the enemies of the Jews were very wroth, and took great indigna|tion and, mocked them, and practi&s;ed to put them in fear, and divert them from their holy purpo&s;e.

<P>When Phillip reigned in Spain, the Netherlands were under his dominion: But being induced by the coun&s;els of wicked mini&s;ters, he abu&s;ed his pow|er, and made an attack upon the liberties of tho&s;e Provinces: He attempted to introduce the inqui|&s;ition, and other innovations among&s;t them. He had all the &s;trength of the large Kingdom of Spain, all the wealth of the new world which was then but lately di&s;covered, and brought immen&s;e reve|nues to the crown. In confidence of &s;ucce&s;s, he made war upon the turbulent, rebellious Hollan|ders, as they were termed by Phillip's courtier.&mdash;The Dutch lay under the di&s;advantage of being ac|ce&s;&s;ible in every part of their country, by their ca|nals: They had to &s;truggle with a very powerful intere&s;t, which Spain had within their own walls: Their leaders were taken off by treachery and private a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination: In the mid&s;t of their conte&s;t, they were de&s;erted by ten of the provinces. Se|ven only remained: They were almo&s;t una&s;&s;i&s;ted by any other powers: And yet the good God of heaven carried them through all the&s;e, and count|le&s;s other difficulties; and rewarded their &s;truggle with the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the reformation and their own liberties. And they have &s;ince become one of the mo&s;t powerful and flouri&s;hing &s;tates in Europe.

I will point you to an in&s;tance nearer home.</P>
<P>In the arbitrary reign of James 2d. Sir Edmund Andro&s;s was &s;ent with an armament, to take po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Charters and Government of the New-England colonies; to overthrow their civil and religious rights; and &s;et up Popery and arbitrary power. The land was covered with a cloud of midnight darkne&s;s. Our pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;&s;es, great as they are, are much inferior to theirs. Their new, Governor executed his commi&s;&s;ion with rigour. Nothing to human appearance awaited this coun|try, but &s;lavery and per&s;ecution from the Man of Sin. But God moved the hearts of our pious Fore-fathers, to u&s;e &s;ome re&s;olute attempts, for the recovery of their lo&s;t privileges, and &s;o ble&s;&s;ed their endeavours, in bringing about the glorious revo|lution, as to &s;ecure this land in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their liberty and religion, until of the&s;e late years, they have been unhappily made the &s;ubjects of a new and bold attack.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The four examples given as in&s;tances of God's gracious inter|po&s;ition to aid the virtuous endeavours of a People, to main|tain their civil and religious immunities, are probably very different in manner of expre&s;&s;ion from the original di&s;cour&s;e, as the Author depended merely upon Memory in peru&s;ing them for the Pre&s;s.</NOTE></P>
<P>As there &s;eldom ever was a nation, who in the beginning of oppre&s;&s;ion were more violently a&s;&s;aul|ted, than we have been; &s;o Hi&s;tory does not af|ford us a &s;ingle in&s;tance, wherein &s;uch a number of people, re&s;olutely oppo&s;ed to &s;lavery, have been &s;oon reduced under the yoke. It is no &s;mall mat|ter of comfort to us, that God will probably fru&s;trate the coun&s;els of tho&s;e, who have called in the aid of a religion, in a peculiar manner accur&s;ed by him.</P>
<P>Their a&s;&s;ociations with the Man of Sin, to lay wa&s;te the liberties of this country, will cau&s;e their

&s;hips with Jeho&s;aphat's, to be broken at Ezion-Geber. However the Quebec Bill may at pre&s;ent appear to be a very unfavourable circum&s;tance, yet I verily believe, that under God, it &s;hall be one great means of our deliverance.&mdash;Let me therefore exhort you, to humble your&s;elves before God for your &s;ins, the cau&s;e of his permitting the&s;e judgments to fall upon us. Repent of all your iniquities; tru&s;t in the Lord, and be of good courage. Put away the vices of the land. Live frugally and temperately; deal ju&s;tly; do violence to no man. Let the eter|nal Laws of Ju&s;tice, be the guide of your whole conduct. Let each one re&s;olve to u&s;e oeconomy in his dre&s;s, at his table, and towards his vi&s;itants. This private oeconomy, and &s;elf-denial, joined with indu&s;try, and a public &s;pirit, will enable us to go chearfully through the burdens of our nece&s;&s;ary, public expences.</P>
<P>Upon our faithful adherence to that plan, devi|&s;ed by the united wi&s;dom of the&s;e Colonies, much under God depends. Thereby we have &s;ome well-grounded hope, of e&s;caping from greater confu&s;ion and blood-&s;hed. Our defection herein, may here|after ju&s;tly fill us with deep remor&s;e, that we have been in&s;trumental, either in forging chains for our country, or in bathing her bo&s;om in the precious Blood of our fellow-&s;ubjects.&mdash;But e&s;pecially, while we renounce any &s;ecure confidence in hu|man help; let our eyes be directed to the Great Saviour of New-England; u&s;e faithfully the means which Providence hath put into our hands for deliverance; nor &s;uffer our&s;elves by treachery, by cowardice, by flattery and fal&s;e hopes, to betray our unalienable property, in our con&s;titution and religion. In this ca&s;e we need not fear the

<P>Tru&s;t therefore in the Lord at all times; and he &s;hall &s;ecure you from the force and wiles of op|pre&s;&s;ors. He &s;hall give wi&s;dom and efficacy to your coun&s;els: He &s;hall fortify your hearts as dangers may ari&s;e.
