<HEAD>THE Author's Preface.</HEAD>
<P>TAKING advantage of the prevailing rage for Novels, the vehicles by which the mo&s;t fatal poi&s;on is often conveyed to the heart, I &s;end the&s;e Volumes into the world, with the humane intention, perhaps pre&s;umptuous hope, of counteracting the effects of &s;uch productions, by in&s;piring my young Readers with ju&s;ter &s;entiments, and a more correct ta&s;te, than what is u&s;u|ally acquired by peru&s;ing books of mere amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>To beguile the remembrance of real and recent misfortunes, by relating a &s;tory, the incidents of which are partly fictitious, I have been in&s;en&s;ibly led to compile this little Work: But though the &s;tory is in|debted to fancy, the reflections with which it is inter&s;per&s;ed, are tho&s;e of &s;entiment, and flow directly from the heart.</P>
<P><PB REF="024442_0003_0FC73B0B36CD6370">
Should the friends in whom mine is mo&s;t tenderly intere&s;ted, reap either plea|&s;ure or improvement from this Work&mdash;&s;hould I, by means of it, in&s;pire one vir|tuous aim, or cheri&s;h one pious &s;entiment in the minds of youth, I &s;hall &s;ubmit con|tentedly to the award of an impartial Public with re&s;pect to its literary merit, of which I am not qualified to judge; but which, in my e&s;timation, is comparatively of little importance.</P>

<HEAD>INTERESTING MEMOIRS.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;pirit of true valour which animated the heroes in the age of Louis XIV, was not confined to France. The contagious manners of a voluptuous monarch, and a licentious court, had not yet diffu&s;ed them&s;elves through the people of England; and their ancient &s;pirit &s;eemed to revive, at the very moment when the rival powers of Eu|rope required that England &s;hould take a decided part in their quarrels, in order to pre&s;erve that ba|lance on which their mutual &s;afety depends.</P>
<P>Adver&s;ity is often the parent of virtue. The do|me&s;tic troubles in which that kingdom had lately been involved, not only gave a check to the progre&s;s of vice and luxury, but led men to think ju&s;tly, which is the fir&s;t &s;tep towards acting nobly.</P>
<P>Among&s;t tho&s;e who, di&s;gu&s;ted with the pur&s;uit of plea&s;ure, or indulgence of &s;loth, wi&s;hed to di&s;tin|gui&s;h them&s;elves in the field of glory and fame, were the young Earl of Granville, and his friend Mr. Seymour.&mdash;The name of a Cond&eacute; in&s;pired them with an ardent ambition, not only to &s;hare in his glory, but to emulate his virtues. Accordingly, having no parents to controul them, or combat what &s;ome would deem a romantic enthu&s;ia&s;m, they embarked for France; reached the army
<PB N="6" REF="024442_0005_0FC73B12C27BF0C8">
which was then encamped at Siennes, and intro|duced them&s;elves to the Prince, as two young &s;ol|diers of fortune, who wi&s;hed to fight under his ban|ner, whil&s;t oppo&s;ing their common enemies.</P>
<P>It is needle&s;s to &s;ay that our young heroes &s;uf|fered no opportunity to e&s;cape of &s;ignalizing them|&s;elves; and &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful were they in their various enterprizes, that at the peace of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Lord Gran|ville was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a Captain's and Mr. Seymour of a Colonel's commi&s;&s;ion. The former returned to England, but the latter entered into the &s;ervice of the Dutch.</P>
<P>Tired at length with the fatigues of war, Colo|nel Seymour determined to abandon them for a life of dome&s;tic quiet. He returned to his native coun|try, which acquaintance with others had only &s;er|ved to endear. With part of his paternal fortune he purcha&s;ed a retired and beautiful farm. He mar|ried an amiable woman, reflected on the various ble&s;&s;ings he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and re&s;olved to be happy.</P>
<P>Habit, however, is often more powerful than principle. Accu&s;tomed to an active life, the pow|ers of his mind langui&s;hed for want of employment. His haughty and imperious temper, which he had been at no pains to &s;ubdue, having now no objects for its exerci&s;e, degenerated into peevi&s;hne&s;s, ca|price, and di&s;content.</P>
<P>His gentle partner bore her &s;hare of this unequal yoke with patient &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. Perhaps, had &s;he exerted a little more &s;pirit, the demands made on her forbearance would neither have been &s;o nume|rous, nor &s;o frequent; but her &s;oul was of that &s;en&s;itive nature, which &s;hrinks from the approach
<PB N="7" REF="024442_0006_0FC73B14365AEEA8">
of &s;trife or unkindne&s;s; and &s;he re&s;olved quietly to bear, what &s;he had neither &s;trength to oppo&s;e, nor &s;kill to remedy.</P>
<P>Colonel Seymour was determined in the choice of his re&s;idence, from its vicinity to the Ca&s;tle of Ha&s;tings; the &s;eat of his ancient friend Lord Gran|ville, who was in truth one of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable characters of that age. He had early imbibed tho&s;e ju&s;t notions of honour, that fortitude, magnanimity, and love of true glory, and all tho&s;e exalted virtues which were di&s;played in the conduct of a Villeroy, a Cond&eacute;, and a Turenne. But, along with the&s;e, he had cheri&s;hed al&s;o the gentler virtues of the heart: The former &s;erve to recommend us to the e&s;teem of others; but it is from the latter we mu&s;t derive our &s;elf-enjoyment.</P>
<P>With all the&s;e advantages, the character of Lord Granville was &s;trongly marked by ambition and high notions of birth. Con&s;cious of having de&s;erv|ed the favour of his &s;overeign, his claims, perhaps, bore a ju&s;ter proportion to his de&s;erts than to the power of his ma&s;ter; who&s;e profu&s;ion and love of plea&s;ure deprived him of the means of rewarding merit, by leading him to be&s;tow his favours chiefly on tho&s;e who contributed at once to his enjoyment and his infamy.</P>
<P>Di&s;gu&s;ted with the Court, the manners of which incurred both his hatred and contempt, he retired to the &s;eat of his ance&s;tors, where, following the natural bias of his exalted mind, he &s;trove to pro|mote the happine&s;s, as he had formerly done the glory, of his country.</P>
<P>He married his cou&s;in Lady Loui&s;a Howard; who, by the prudence of her mother, had been
<PB N="8" REF="024442_0007_0FC73B19B3275258">
&s;heltered in the quiet of retirement from the gene|ral contagion; that lady choo&s;ing rather, by living in the country, to deprive her daughter of the high poli&s;h of a court, than to &s;tain the purity of her mind, by expo&s;ing her to its corrupting manners and example.</P>
<P>A year after their marriage, Lord Granville's happine&s;s received a greater addition than he thought it could admit of, by the birth of a &s;on; and before other two expired, his lady pre&s;ented him likewi&s;e with a daughter. But the la&s;t only &s;urvived long enough to make her excellent parents experience the whole bitterne&s;s of &s;orrow; by giving early proofs of talents fitted to adorn a public &s;tation, and virtues to endear a dome&s;tic character.</P>
<P>The &s;tricte&s;t intimacy had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in early life, between Lady Granville and Mrs. Seymour, who&s;e education had been carried on together under the in&s;pection of Lady Howard. And though neither of the&s;e young ladies po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed that &s;anguine temper and lively imagination, which gave birth to the en|thu&s;ia&s;m of friend&s;hip, they felt for each other that &s;ettled e&s;teem and complacency which often forms the mo&s;t la&s;ting attachments.</P>
<P>Theirs was afterwards &s;trengthened and con|firmed by con&s;tant intercour&s;e between the two fa|milies, and acquired a peculiar tenderne&s;s from their mutual di&s;tre&s;&s;es: For it is certain, tho&s;e ami|cable connections are ever the mo&s;t la&s;ting, which take their ri&s;e from mutual dependence and &s;ym|pathy.</P>
<P>In the kind and gentle bo&s;om of Mrs. Seymour, Lady Granville repo&s;ed that tender &s;orrow which
<PB N="9" REF="024442_0008_0FC73B1C76DCEFE8">
the lo&s;s of her daughter occa&s;ioned, and which the fear of increa&s;ing the di&s;tre&s;s of a hu&s;band &s;he fond|ly loved, made her repre&s;s in his pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>The &s;ufferings of Mrs. Seymour from the con|&s;tant bad humour of the Colonel, were of a very different nature; and though they could not be con|cealed from the ob&s;ervation of her friend, yet &s;o &s;acred did &s;he hold the weakne&s;s of a character, with which &s;he was &s;o nearly connected, that &s;he never mentioned them, but with a view to palliate what &s;he vainly endeavoured to hide, and never could hope to amend.</P>
<P>The temper of Colonel Seymour, however, &s;eem|ed &s;en&s;ibly changed, by an event equally agreeable and unexpected. After having been &s;everal years married without children, Mrs. Seymour was deli|vered of a fine girl, who awakened in the bo&s;om of her father &s;en&s;ations the mo&s;t tender and delight|ful; and agreeably employed his mind in forming &s;chemes for her future education and improvement.</P>
<P>The birth of this child was con&s;idered by Lady Granville as the happie&s;t circum&s;tance that could befal her friend; nor did it &s;eem of much le&s;s con|&s;equence to her&s;elf. The young Lord Ha&s;tings ha|ving been &s;ent about this time on a vi&s;it to his grandmother, Lady Granville felt, that the death of her daughter, and ab&s;ence of her &s;on, was a trial too great for her weak &s;pirits to &s;upport: Heaven &s;eem|ed to have &s;ent this child to &s;upply, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure, the void thus left in her heart. She vi&s;ited Springwood every day, and never failed to care&s;s the &s;weet innocent with all a mother's fondne&s;s. Mrs. Seymour, well knowing the attachment Lady
<PB N="10" REF="024442_0009_0FC73B1DF79C5018">
Granville had to the name of Loui&s;a, which her la|mented child had borne, reque&s;ted her to become godmother to the little &s;tranger, and to allow it to be chri&s;tened by that name.</P>
<P>"I receive with gratitude this in&s;tance of your delicate attention," replied Lady Granville; "but, indeed my beloved friend, though I accept the name, you mu&s;t pardon me for declining the office of godmother. An oath is of two &s;acred a nature to be unnece&s;&s;arily undertaken; the parents are certainly the mo&s;t proper &s;pon&s;ors for their children: I have never a&s;ked any per&s;on to &s;tand for mine, becau&s;e I think this not only a u&s;ele&s;s ceremony, but, with the generality of the world, a criminal profanation of a mo&s;t &s;acred engagement."</P>
<P>For &s;ome time the lovely Loui&s;a &s;eemed to re&s;tore peace and even cheerfulne&s;s to the bo&s;om of her parents.</P>
<P>Their fondne&s;s for her was great, but it was ju&s;ti|fied by the beauty and &s;weetne&s;s of their little dar|ling. Her time was divided between them and Lord and Lady Granville, who&s;e affection for her &s;eemed almo&s;t equal to that which nature in&s;pires.</P>
<P>Her education, during the fir&s;t years of her life, agreeably occupied tho&s;e hours which u&s;ed to hang heavy on the hands of her fond father; and he af|terwards continued to &s;uperintend him&s;elf her progre&s;s in tho&s;e branches which required the aid of &s;uperior ma&s;ters. In the mid&s;t of the&s;e agreeable occupations, however, the family at Springwood received a &s;hock, which being alike unfortunate and unfore&s;een, produced the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="024442_0010_0FC73B2035D89B60">
The Colonel's fortune, con&s;i&s;ting of fifteen thou|&s;and pounds, he was advi&s;ed to &s;ecure in the funds; and for that purpo&s;e had collected and placed it in the hands of an eminent broker, who was to have tran&s;acted the bu&s;ine&s;s the very day on which he died. His affairs were found in the greate&s;t confu|&s;ion; and after every attempt to a&s;&s;ert his ju&s;t claims, the Colonel could only recover three of the fifteen thou&s;and.</P>
<P>This blow, to a man advanced in years, chagrined in temper, and declining in health, was indeed a dreadful one. The Colonel was neither po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that philo&s;ophy which teaches us to bear patiently what we cannot e&s;cape, nor &s;oothed with that religi|on which palliates the bitterne&s;s of di&s;appointed hope with the a&s;&s;urance of certain felicity.</P>
<P>To a per&s;on about to quit life, one would think the goods of fortune would &s;eem trivial and in&s;ignifi|cant; but the mind gra&s;ps at tho&s;e objects in which it has long delighted, and feels its fondne&s;s for them increa&s;e, by the near pro&s;pect of a &s;eparation.</P>
<P>The Colonel &s;trove to brave the &s;torm, and &s;up|port this &s;troke with the re&s;olution of a &s;oldier. The hardy oak proudly oppo&s;es the whole fury of the ele|ments, and is &s;corched by the lightning, or over|thrown by the tempe&s;t; whil&s;t the humble willow, by gently yielding to its force, pre&s;erves &s;ecure its unenvied &s;tation. Such were the different tempers with which the Colonel and his amiable wi&s;e en|countered adver&s;ity, and &s;uch too were the different effects produced by it.&mdash;Colonel Seymour did not long lament his lo&s;s of fortune; a &s;udden &s;troke of the pal&s;y put a period to that life, which was already wearing towards its clo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="024442_0011_0FC73B2717537368">
Though the di&s;tre&s;s and con&s;tant inquietude which his caprice and illhumour had inflicted on his gentle partner, were now no more; yet after his death, &s;he experienced pangs a thou&s;and times more &s;evere than any his har&s;hne&s;s had occa&s;ioned. In the grave of a friend we bury all his foibles; there we &s;acrifice our little di&s;gu&s;ts and re&s;entments: Time, whil&s;t it throws a &s;acred veil over his errors, &s;erves al&s;o greatly to magnify his virtues. We re|member them without tho&s;e &s;hades which the im|perfection of human nature had mingled with them,&mdash;we feel our irreparable lo&s;s,&mdash;we deplore it,&mdash;and the tenderne&s;s of melancholy, uniting with the admiration of virtue, gives birth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a &s;entiment too exqui&s;ite to be defined; and which, by con&s;tantly accompanying the idea of our departed friend, ren|ders our mournful recollection of pa&s;t plea&s;ures of|ten more delightful than the enjoyment of &s;uch as are pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>At lei&s;ure to reflect on the various &s;ituations and infirm health of Colonel Seymour, his afflicted wife found a thou&s;and rea&s;ons to excu&s;e, and even ju&s;ti|fy his capricious temper. A thou&s;and proofs of his tenderne&s;s ru&s;hed on her mind; and &s;he accu&s;ed her&s;elf continually of having been impatient under the one and ungrateful for the other. Unhappy effect of an exce&s;s of the mo&s;t amiable virtues, hu|mility and ingenuity!</P>
<P>The friend&s;hip of Lady Granville &s;u&s;tained at this trying juncture the feeblene&s;s of her mind, and aided the efforts of her rea&s;on, to di&s;pel the cloud with which grief had enveloped it. Her heart found its chief con&s;olation in the innocent endearments and watchful attentions of her charming daughter,
<PB N="13" REF="024442_0012_0FC73B2A11D552A8">
who was now become the only &s;ource of her com|fort, the only object of her care.</P>
<P>The &s;ingular beauty of her per&s;on, whil&s;t it flat|tered the vanity of a mother, awakened in her bo|&s;om a variety of apprehen&s;ions. She never regret|ted the lo&s;s of fortune on her own account; but when &s;he con&s;idered the dangers and mortifications to which it would &s;ubject her child, accu&s;tomed to a&s;&s;ociate with people in a &s;uperior rank, and edu|cated with the pro&s;pect of an independent fortune, her heart died within her; nor was this the chief &s;ource of her inquietude. She early di&s;covered in Loui&s;a, that refined and ingenuous &s;en&s;ibility, which would at once expo&s;e her to the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite &s;uf|ferings, and incapacitate her for &s;upporting them.</P>
<P>The various anxities that preyed on her mind, enfeebled her body, and impaired her health with terror and angui&s;h. Loui&s;a &s;aw her daily declining. Afraid to awaken tho&s;e apprehen&s;ions in the bo&s;om of her mother, which &s;he could no longer bani&s;h from her own, &s;he communicated her fears to her &s;ympathi&s;ing friend Lady Granville; who, on pre|tence of a call in pa&s;&s;ing, brought an eminent phy|&s;ician to vi&s;it Mrs. Seymour. He made no &s;cru|ple to pronounce her in danger of a decline, and advi&s;ed immediate change of climate as the only po&s;&s;ible means of prolonging her life.</P>
<P>It was a nece&s;&s;ary, but painful office, to commu|nicate this information to Mrs. Seymour. Lady Granville did &s;o in the mo&s;t cautious manner.&mdash;<Q>Think not, my watchful friend, replied &s;he, that I am either ignorant of my malady, or &s;hock|ed with my danger. Death has for &s;ome time
<PB N="14" REF="024442_0013_0FC73B2B80AA5578">
been familiar to my thoughts, and, as far as was allowable, the object of my wi&s;hes. That I have hitherto been &s;ilent on this &s;ubject, proceeded entirely from aver&s;ion to give you pain, and to afflict my beloved child, who&s;e heart, alas! is but too &s;en&s;ible to every di&s;tre&s;s of her mother's.</Q></P>
<P><Q>If we mu&s;t part, to you I confide my trea&s;ure; on you I rely for &s;upplying her lo&s;s, and even teaching her to forget it, by your generous, con|&s;tant friend&s;hip.</Q></P>
<P>Lady Granville was deeply affected by this con|ver&s;ation, and after the mo&s;t &s;olemn a&s;&s;urances of fidelity to the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in her, urged Mrs. Sey|mour, in the &s;tronge&s;t terms, to con&s;ent to going abroad without delay. She oppo&s;ed her arguments with a variety of pleas; at la&s;t, looking tenderly at her friend, and pau&s;ing for a moment, <Q>Why, why, my deare&s;t Lady Granville, &s;hould you be thus anxious to pre&s;erve a life, which is evidently ha&s;|tening to a period; and which I cannot even pro|long, but at an expence which my little fortune can ill &s;upport. You know the whole amount of Colonel Seymour's effects does not exceed three thou&s;and pounds; a &s;um by no means adequate to the expen&s;ive education of Loui&s;a, and which, if I cannot increa&s;e by my oeconomy, I will at lea&s;t never dimini&s;h in the way of a doubtful ex|periment. With me, indeed, its effects are not doubtful, &s;ince I am convinced by my feelings, that I never can recover.</Q></P>
<P>Lady Granville cea&s;ed to urge her friend; but on her returning home, wrote her the following letter, inclo&s;ing a draught on her banker for a thou&s;and pounds.</P>

<P>My mother has ju&s;t informed me of the letter you have &s;ent her. O Lady Granville! O my dear &s;econd parent! how can I re&s;train my gratitude, my admiration of your goodne&s;s, or rather how can I expre&s;s it? Your noble genero&s;ity quite overpow|ers my heart. This gift to my mother, &s;o &s;urpri&s;|ing, &s;o unexpected&mdash;but why do I talk in this man|ner? Is there any thing great or good that is not familiar to Lady Granville? Deare&s;t Madam!

<P>It being now the month of September, there was no time to lo&s;e in making preparations for the de|parture of Mrs. Seymour and her daughter. About this time, Lord and Lady Granville received the mo&s;t lively &s;atisfaction by the return of Lord Ha&s;t|ings from an academy where he had &s;pent the la&s;t &s;ix years. The ma&s;ter of it, having long officiated as chaplain in the regiment commanded by Colonel Seymour, had recommended him&s;elf to the e&s;teem of all the officers, by his good &s;en&s;e, liberal &s;enti|ments, and unaffected <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ety; and by his una&s;&s;uming manners and &s;trict regard to his duty, was revered even by tho&s;e who lived in the con&s;tant violation of theirs&mdash;Such is the power of real goodne&s;s!</P>
<P>The advantages to be reaped from &s;uch an in&s;truc|tor, were too many, not to over balance, in minds like Lord and Lady Granville's, the natural de&s;ire of having their only &s;on placed near them. And as Dr. Melville complained, that the frequent avocati|ons occa&s;ioned by the holidays, had a bad effect in di&s;&s;ipating the minds of his young pupils, and giving them habits of inattention, his fond parents &s;acri|ficed their indulgence to his improvement, and never brought him home but a Chri&s;tmas.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="024442_0017_0FC73B39F0170130">
Nine months had elap&s;ed &s;ince his la&s;t vi&s;it at the ca&s;tle, and the change which that time had pro|duced on his per&s;on, was remarked with admiration by all its inhabitants.</P>
<P>He had ju&s;t reached his twenty-&s;econd year; a period, when young men of rank too often appear in a di&s;agreeable light, either from the rude indif|ference or affected petulance of their manners. Equally remote from the clown and the coxcomb, Lord Ha&s;tings appeared with that mode&s;ty and re|&s;erve which agreed &s;o well with the dignity of his a&s;pect, and &s;ingular elegance of his per&s;on, that it was as impo&s;&s;ible to behold him without complacen|cy, as to li&s;ten to him without admiration. His fine intelligent eyes convinced one before he &s;pake, that one had every thing noble to expect from the mind that informed them; and as their expre&s;&s;ion varied with every varying &s;entiment, the feel|ing heart took an immediate intere&s;t in their lan|guage.</P>
<P>It is highly flattering to our &s;elf-love, to find our fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions confirmed. The character of Lord Ha&s;tings did more than fulfil the agreeable pre&s;a|ges to which the fir&s;t &s;ight of his per&s;on gave birth.</P>
<P>It was impo&s;&s;ible that two young people, &s;o per|fectly amiable as Mi&s;s Seymour and Lord Ha&s;tings, could behold each other with indifference; but wholly unaccu&s;tomed to the &s;ociety of women, he felt him&s;elf embarra&s;&s;ed in her pre&s;ence; and from a &s;ort of &s;ecret con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, appeared deficient even in &s;uch little attentions as politene&s;s teaches tho&s;e who do not feel their propriety; but which his natural &s;en&s;ibility and good ta&s;te would certainly
<PB N="19" REF="024442_0018_0FC73B3B3AB140D8">
have led him to pay any other woman. The admi|ration her beauty excited was a &s;entiment wholly new and delightful; but his heart was in no dan|ger from any other, as the opportunities of &s;eeing Mi&s;s Seymour &s;eldom occurred; and her attention was &s;o entirely engro&s;&s;ed by her mother, that &s;he &s;carcely ever &s;pent an hour at the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>Every thing being adju&s;ted for their departure, Mrs. Seymour and her charming daughter took a very tender leave of Lord and Lady Granville. Lord Ha&s;tings was pre&s;ent at this interview, and felt him&s;elf deeply affected by the behaviour of Loui&s;a; who, on embracing her benefactre&s;s, &s;eem|ed wholly to forget that there were any witne&s;&s;es of her emotions, and bur&s;ting into tears, with much difficulty articulated the&s;e words: "Oh Lady Granville! what do I not owe you?&mdash;Perhaps the life of my beloved parent!&mdash;But heaven will re|ward you,&mdash;I never, never can."</P>
<P>Lord Ha&s;tings pre&s;ented her his hand; her's trembled exceedingly from the agitation of her mind. He conveyed her to the chai&s;e, in which her mother waited for her; he wi&s;hed Mrs. Sey|mour every advantage &s;he could po&s;&s;ibly de&s;ire from her journey; he would have &s;aid &s;omething to Lou|i&s;a, but the &s;ight of her lovely face, bedewed with tears, deprived him of utterance. He had time only to bid her adieu, the chai&s;e drove off, and left him in a &s;tate of mind equally new and agitating; the cau&s;e of which he did not di&s;cover, becau&s;e, perhaps, he was at no pains to inquire.</P>
<P>On his entering the parlour, the conver&s;ation na|turally turned on the travellers. Both Lord and
<PB N="20" REF="024442_0019_0FC73B3CB5EE0F90">
Lady Granville joined in the highe&s;t encomiums on the character of Mrs. Seymour, and the &s;ingular beauty and &s;weetne&s;s of her daughter; who&s;e filial piety Lady Granville prai&s;ed, with the enthu&s;ia&s;m of a friend, and the fondne&s;s of a mother.</P>
<P>The &s;peech Loui&s;a had made at parting dwelt on the mind of Lord Ha&s;tings; and no &s;ooner did his father leave the room, than he eagerly demanded an explanation of it from Lady Granville.</P>
<P>She he&s;itated a few moments, and then taking out of her pocket the two letters &s;he had received a fortnight before&mdash;"The occa&s;ion of the&s;e, my dear Henry," &s;aid &s;he, "was my &s;ending a draught to my valuable friend, to defray the expence of a jour|ney, which &s;he would not undertake, for fear of encroaching too far on her daughter's &s;lender fortune.&mdash;Heaven grant this journey &s;ucce&s;s!"</P>
<P>Lord Ha&s;tings read the letters with the mo&s;t ear|ne&s;t attention; on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ini&s;hing that from Loui&s;a, he aro&s;e with vi&s;ible emotion, returned them to his mother, and gra&s;ping her hand, which he pre&s;&s;ed to his lips, he looked at her for &s;ome moments with eyes that &s;poke both love, gratitude, and admiration; then, heaving a &s;igh, he exclaimed,&mdash;"Oh may I never, never give pain to a &s;oul &s;o tender, &s;o gener|ous as yours!" and ha&s;tily quitted the room.</P>
<P>He retired to his own apartment, and full of the &s;cenes which had ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed, took up his pen, and addre&s;&s;ed his friend Mr. Beaufort, with whom he had long been accu&s;tomed to &s;hare every thought; and who had gone lately to the univer&s;ity at Cam|bridge, whither he was &s;oon to follow:</P>

<P>As I never can enjoy any &s;atisfaction in which my dear Beaufort does not partake, I ha&s;ten to tell you, that the tenderne&s;s with which I am treated by the be&s;t of parents, makes me almo&s;t forget the ab&s;ence of my friend. Often have we admired to|gether, the great, the awful virtues of a Cato, a Brutus, and a Fabius: but with what &s;uperior de|light do I contemplate tho&s;e of a mild, gentle, do|me&s;tic nature, which are daily di&s;played at the ca&s;|tle of Ha&s;tings! With what reverence do I behold the genero&s;ity, with what gratitude feel the affection of Lord and Lady Granville; who, forgetting the authority of parents, conde&s;cend to treat me with the confidence and familiarity of friends.</P>
<P>Upon my arrival here, I was introduced by my mother to her mo&s;t intimate friend, the widow of Colonel Seymour; and her daughter, a beautiful girl about &s;eventeen. The former appears to be &s;en&s;ible, mode&s;t, and agreeable, but in a very de|clining &s;tate of health. I would attempt a de&s;crip|tion of the latter, but am aware of your raillery. I will confe&s;s, however, I never &s;aw &s;o intere&s;ting a countenance, or &s;o much beauty joined with &s;uch engaging &s;implicity. For the la&s;t quality, &s;he is probably indebted to her retired manner of life, which has been &s;pent here at a &s;weet romantic farm called Springwood, purcha&s;ed by Colonel Seymour, on account of its nearne&s;s to the ca&s;tle; he and my father having been intimately acquainted when abroad.</P>

<P>You rally me, Beaufort, as I fore&s;aw would be the ca&s;e; you even pronounce me downrightly in love, and affirm, that my wound is already too deep to bear being probed: You tell me that con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s alone could make me fear the raillery of my friend, and that it would have been more natural at twenty-two to have launched out in the prai&s;e of a young beauty, than to harangue on the virtues of an old father and mother.</P>
<P>Well; enjoy your fancied penetration: to di&s;|pute your opinion, I plainly perceive, would be to confirm you in error. Yet &s;pite of your malice, I would attempt a de&s;cription of this charming girl, were I not con&s;cious that I am utterly incapable of doing ju&s;tice, either to her mind or per&s;on.</P>
<P>Brought up at a di&s;tance from the gay world, &s;he blends the mode&s;ty of innocence with the ea&s;e of politene&s;s; &s;he is a &s;tranger to its cu&s;toms; but from the readine&s;s of her apprehen&s;ion, the elegance of her manners, and the warmth of her heart, ap|pears only to be ignorant of its vices and follies.</P>

The delicacy of her form agrees with that of her mind; I fear &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es too great a &s;hare of that &s;en&s;ibility, which, though the &s;ource of our mo&s;t exqui&s;ite enjoyments, often too occa&s;ions our mo&s;t la&s;ting inquietudes; by expo&s;ing us to danger from every quarter, and rendering us vulnerable on every &s;ide. To be &s;erious, Beaufort, I &s;hould reckon an attachment to Mi&s;s Seymour a very real misfor|tune. She &s;eems perfectly amiable, and qualified to adorn any &s;tation; but you are no &s;tranger to the high &s;pirit of my father, and cannot doubt that he would greatly di&s;approve of his only &s;on entertain|ing a &s;erious pa&s;&s;ion for the daughter of a private gentleman, with &s;carce any other patrimony than the liberal education he has be&s;towed on her.</P>
<P>I am extremely concerned for the &s;ituation of poor Talbot; his misfortunes will not be the le&s;s &s;everely felt, for being the con&s;equence of his own folly.</P>
<P>Poor fellow! he has many good qualities; but a certain pliancy of di&s;po&s;ition, joined to an intem|perate love of plea&s;ure, is his ruin. Could you wean him from the wor&s;t of all vices, gaming, I &s;hould &s;till have hopes of his reformation; but that I fear is impo&s;&s;ible. Take what method you judge mo&s;t proper of conveying the inclo&s;ed to him; do not mention my name; but, if po&s;&s;ible, prevent its be|ing lavi&s;hed on villains and &s;harpers.</P>

<P>I am plea&s;ed, my dear Henry, by my promi&s;e to you, to be under the nece&s;&s;ity of indulging my&s;elf. You may be a&s;&s;ured no employment can be half &s;o agreeable as that by which my &s;on may reap either plea&s;ure or improvement.</P>
<P>It was with peculiar &s;atisfaction I remarked during your la&s;t vi&s;it, that your &s;tudies had not been confined to what was only elegant and entertaining, but that you had made &s;cience rather than literature the object of your pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the former are ever mode&s;t and re&s;erved; tho&s;e of the latter are generally proud and loquacious. The &s;phere of real knowledge is very narrow, but the immen&s;ity of &s;pace lies open to hypothe&s;is, the favourite bu&s;ine&s;s of Literature.</P>
<P>The extent of her domain renders her in&s;olent, and the deference paid to her opinions teaches her to over-rate her powers. The ca&s;e is quite differ|ent with Science. Not content with the informa|tion of others, &s;he explores truth by the help of her own eyes; but con&s;cious that the&s;e are liable to de|ception, and take in only a very limited pro&s;pect, &s;he is afraid to pronounce dogmatically on any que&s;|tion. She never impiou&s;ly attempts to pa&s;s the boundaries which have been a&s;&s;igned her by Hea|ven, and is ever more ready to a&s;&s;ume the character of the pupil than the preceptor.</P>
<P>Good ta&s;te, my dear Henry, is a powerful co|adjutor to rea&s;on in the conduct of life. The per|ception

of moral beauty is much akin to that of natural; and a mind capable of receiving vivid im|pre&s;&s;ions of the latter, will ea&s;ily feel the influence of the former. Strive then to cultivate the love of every thing great, &s;ublime, and beautiful, whe|ther in the natural or moral world; you will find this a powerful pre&s;ervative again&s;t tho&s;e dangers to which your youth, rank, and fortune peculiarly expo&s;e you. Unhappily they attack us mo&s;t pow|erfully at that period, when we have neither &s;trength to re&s;i&s;t, nor &s;kill to elude their force; but good ta&s;te, uniting with good principles, will enable you to &s;tand your ground, and even baffle all the arts of &s;eduction.

<P>I &s;end my dear Henry the draught he de&s;ires, but have doubled the &s;um, that he may be under no temptation to repre&s;s one wi&s;h of his generous heart.</P>
<P>Poli&s;hed, or, in other words, luxurious na|tions, are peculiarly favourable to the growth of &s;elf-love; there, individuals feel &s;o many wants, that their attention is chiefly engro&s;&s;ed by private concernments.

yet let me warn you, not to be impo&s;ed on by tho&s;e who are improper objects of your bounty. In this ca&s;e, your intended charity not only deprives the virtuous poor of their claims, but proves an encou|ragement to vice and &s;loth. It is nece&s;&s;ity, not choice, that incites the lower cla&s;&s;es of mankind to action; and were the indigent &s;ecure of food and clothing from the opulent, there would be a final ce&s;&s;ation of indu&s;try; and then what dreadful di&s;orders would en&s;ue?</P>
<P>The de&s;ire of knowledge at your age is both natural and proper; but take care that your pur|&s;uit be properly directed. Metaphy&s;ical refinements and di&s;qui&s;itions, whil&s;t they flatter the pride of man, mi&s;lead his judgment, and corrupt his heart; and whil&s;t they deceive him with promi&s;es of &s;upe|rior light, &s;teal from him in&s;en&s;ibly tho&s;e hopes and fears, which Omni&s;cience has a&s;&s;igned as the great &s;prings of human conduct; and plunge him at length in darkne&s;s and de&s;pair. Religion is the only &s;ure ba&s;is of morality. Do not even its ene|mies confe&s;s this, when they term it a political en|gine? In truth, human &s;ociety cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t with|out the aid of religion; and the wi&s;e&s;t legi&s;lators have acknowledged, that it was &s;afer for the popu|lace to have a fabulous creed, than none at all.</P>
<P>Make religion then, my dear Henry, a &s;ubject of attentive enquiry; but always remember it is its evidence, not its doctrines, of which you are to con&s;titute rea&s;on the judge. Whatever is derived from a Being of infinite wi&s;dom mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to contain many things above human comprehen|&s;ion. The path of duty is plain; be that your chief &s;tudy.</P>

<P>I am per&s;uaded, we who are enlightened by Revelation are very incompetent judges of the ex|tent of una&s;&s;i&s;ted rea&s;on; and often attribute to her natural force, what is the effect of &s;upernatural il|lumination. Some trifling critics have condemned the ancient poets for a&s;cribing the victories of their heroes to the interpo&s;ition of their gods. "What merit," &s;ay they, "is there in obtaining a conque&s;t by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Jove?" Homer has had ju&s;ter notions of the importance of divine aid, than many who call them&s;elves Chri&s;tians.

highly u&s;eful for the conduct of life. It has likewi&s;e the &s;tronge&s;t tendency to exalt our ideas of the Divine government, by di&s;playing to us the &s;upreme Di&s;po&s;er of all events, educing good from evil, order from confu&s;ion, and rendering the deep|e&s;t laid plans of treachery and violence, not only &s;ubver&s;ive of the ends propo&s;ed, but evidently con|ducive to the contrary.</P>
<P>There too, you will di&s;cover the &s;uperior ex|cellency of Chri&s;tianity wherever it has had its full effect.

Mrs. Seymour and her daughter reached Dover without any cro&s;s accident. While they waited for the pacquet, a coach drove into the yard, the live|ries of which Mrs. Seymour in&s;tantly recollected to belong to the Honourable Mr. Stanhope, with who&s;e family &s;he had become acquainted, whil&s;t on a vi&s;it at London. He was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an am|ple fortune, but had the affliction to &s;ee his only &s;on in &s;o alarming a &s;tate of health after a fall from his hor&s;e, that, by advice of his phy&s;icians, Mr. and Mrs. Stanhope were re&s;olved to carry him abroad, to try the effect of a warmer climate.</P>
<P>Few things could have proved more fortunate or agreeable to the two families, than this rencounter; they immediately joined companies; the anxieties of Mrs. Stanhope's mind were con&s;iderably alleviated by communicating them to her &s;en&s;ible friend; and the languor in&s;eparable from bad health, awakened in the compa&s;&s;ionate bo&s;om of Loui&s;a a degree of &s;olicitude to amu&s;e young Mr. Stanhope, which often made him forget that he had any cau&s;e of complaint.</P>
<P>They arrived at Paris at a time when travellers would have found objects &s;ufficient to gratify both ta&s;te and curio&s;ity; but, health being the &s;ole end of their pur&s;uit, they declined accepting the many polite invitations they received from people of the fir&s;t fa&s;hion, to whom they had brought letters of recommendation. In con&s;equence of one of the&s;e, the Marchione&s;s de St. Croix waited on Mrs. Sey|mour, and urged her in &s;uch &s;trong, yet polite terms, to accompany her for a few days to her delightful villa on the borders of the Fore&s;t of St. Germain's, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to refu&s;e her reque&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="024442_0029_0FC73B60EB241910">
The Marchione&s;s was a widow; her family con|&s;i&s;ted of a &s;on and three daughters, all of whom were educated in a manner &s;uitable to their birth; but their fortune being very &s;mall, as is cu&s;tomary in France, two of them were de&s;tined to the con|ventual life.</P>
<P>Adelaide, the younge&s;t, who had been &s;ome time a boarder in the Nunnery of St. Cire, was now on a vi&s;it to her mother, before entering on her novi|ciate there. She was about two years older than Mi&s;s Seymour; alike amiable and engaging, though not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch regular beauty. When the&s;e two ladies met, the impre&s;&s;ion they made on each other was too &s;trong ever to be era&s;ed. Philo&s;ophers tell us, when kindred &s;ouls come within the &s;phere of each other's influence, they as naturally attract and are attracted by each other, as homogeneous bodies.</P>
<P>An air of melancholy, &s;pread over the &s;oft fea|tures of Adelaide, &s;en&s;ibly touched the heart of Loui&s;a, which vibrated to every expre&s;&s;ion of ten|derne&s;s.</P>
<P>Strangers to &s;u&s;picion or di&s;gui&s;e, the unhappy fruits of commerce with the world, their friend&s;hip commenced at fir&s;t &s;ight.</P>
<P>In forming an amicable connection, there is no need of laying down rules, or &s;pecifying the duties incumbent on the &s;everal parties. The &s;oul which is capable of that exalted union, will it&s;elf &s;ugge&s;t every &s;entiment, and lead to every action, which real friend&s;hip involves in it.</P>

During her re&s;idence at the Villa de St. Croix, Mrs. Seymore was &s;o much recruited, that &s;he &s;ome|times prevailed with her daughter to accompany the Marchione&s;s to Paris, in order to &s;ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e in the public amu&s;ements.

<P>She returned to St. Germains, with a double re|li&s;h for its peaceful &s;hades and innocent amu&s;ements; and looked back with pity on tho&s;e who pur&s;ue plea|&s;ure with &s;uch eagerne&s;s, that they generally run it down in the chace.</P>
<P>Mrs. Seymour received a letter from Mrs. Stan|hope, informing her of her re&s;olution of &s;pending the remainder of the winter at Montpellier, and entreating her to accompany her thither. The heart of Loui&s;a was divided on this occa&s;ion; as her mo|ther was &s;en&s;ibly better, &s;he was &s;trongly tempted to yield to the &s;olicitations of her gentle friend, who urged her to &s;pend &s;ome time with her in the Con|vent before the awful ceremony of her admi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>As there were &s;ome branches of education, par|ticularly mu&s;ic, in which Loui&s;a required &s;till further in&s;tructions, Mrs. Seymour joined her entreaties with tho&s;e of Adelaide; and at la&s;t per&s;uaded her duteous and affectionate child, to commit her, for a &s;hort time, to the care of Mr. and Mrs. Stanhope, and return with Adelaide to St. Cire.</P>

By an application to the re&s;pectable foundre&s;s of this noble in&s;titution, Mi&s;s Seymour was admit|ted there as a boarder; though not being of the noble&s;&s;e, this was an infringement of the e&s;tabli&s;hed rules; but that convent being then in its infancy, engaged Madame Maintenon to di&s;pen&s;e with them on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>She was greatly &s;truck with the fir&s;t view of this noble edifice, and the magnificent park of Ver&s;ailles, in which it is &s;ituated; but her walks were chiefly confined to the gardens, where alone &s;he could en|joy the &s;ociety of her beloved friend.</P>
<P>The melancholy which Loui&s;a had formerly re|marked in Adelaide, &s;eemed to increa&s;e every day; and was become &s;o habitual, that &s;he could not help &s;u&s;pecting it aro&s;e from di&s;like to the manner of life on which &s;he was about to enter.</P>
<P>She que&s;tioned her with much earne&s;tne&s;s on the &s;ubject; and conjured her, by their mutual friend&s;hip, to lay open her heart to her without re|&s;erve; to receive the con&s;olation of her &s;ympathy, and confide in her inviolable attachment.</P>
<P>Adelaide appeared &s;o much affected during this di&s;cour&s;e, that Loui&s;a began to repent having intro|duced it. At length bur&s;ting into tears, "O my Loui&s;a! cried &s;he, why &s;hould I longer &s;trive to conceal from you the &s;orrow that preys upon my heart! Yes, my friend, I am indeed unhappy, but not from the cau&s;e you imagine.</P>
<Q><P>You have a claim to my utmo&s;t confidence; and believe me, the only rea&s;on for withholding it,
<PB N="33" REF="024442_0032_0FC73B6CD47BAAE8">
has been a regard to your ea&s;e and honour. I fear|ed le&s;t my mother &s;hould have que&s;tioned you on a &s;ubject, which would have forced you either to have &s;acrificed your own ingenuity, or the peace of your friend.</P>
<P>You have heard my brother mention the name of Grammont, with tho&s;e encomiums which are due to his merit. Before joining his regiment, in which he holds only the rank of a captain, he came to &s;pend &s;ome weeks with my brother at St. Ger|mains. Prepared to admire his talents by the en|thu&s;ia&s;tic prai&s;es of his friend, I &s;oon learnt al&s;o to love his virtues by acquaintance with him&s;elf. Oh, Loui&s;a! what &s;cience is &s;o ea&s;ily acquired as that of admiring merit; what tran&s;ition is &s;o natural as from admiring to loving it?</P>
<P>But I will not tire you with a repetition of the various circum&s;tances which confirmed my opinion of Grammont's uncommon virtues; &s;uffice it to &s;ay, that I revered them in my heart, which could not withhold its mo&s;t tender affection from a man, who &s;olicited, with timid mode&s;ty, that e&s;teem he had a right to claim, and implored my forgivene&s;s for pre|&s;uming to love me; a fault which my own experi|ence proved to be involuntary, my own feelings taught me to excu&s;e.</P>
<P>For &s;ome time we were &s;o intoxicated with the delightful indulgence of our mutual tenderne&s;s, that we forgot the ob&s;tacles which oppo&s;ed our uni|on. I am convinced, Loui&s;a, the world affords not a happine&s;s equal to that of indulging a tender reci|procal affection, founded in virtue, approved by rea|&s;on, endeared by confidence, and &s;ecured by delicacy.
<PB N="34" REF="024442_0033_0FC73B6E37F4F768">
There is even a peculiar charm connected with the &s;ecret po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of joys, that are not common.&mdash;Our youth, want of fortune, and the life to which I was de&s;tined, were ob&s;tacles in the eye of rea&s;on, which were altogether in&s;urmountable; but,
<Q>Love bids us hope, where Rea&s;on bids de&s;pair:&mdash;</Q>
and either from a natural activity, or con&s;cious elevation of mind, we take plea&s;ure in conquering difficulties in the attainment of our favourite pur&s;uits.</P>
<P>The time for joining his regiment drew near, Already the King's troops had taken the field, and tho&s;e of the Mar&s;hal inve&s;ted the fortre&s;s of&mdash;. What a &s;eparation for two hearts that &s;o greatly loved and feared as ours did! The evening before his departure, Grammont prevailed on me to meet him in the garden, at an hour when the re&s;t of the family were engaged with cards and mu&s;ic, that our parting might be without witne&s;&s;es.&mdash;Oh Lou|i&s;a! &s;hall I ever forget that hour? How often, when &s;itting in the arbour that borders the canal, have you chid me for my pen&s;ive looks and wander|ing incoherent expre&s;&s;ions! Ah, my friend! you know not the tender recollections that then over|powered my &s;oul. Alas! at this moment I am al|mo&s;t tempted to wi&s;h I had never known him who occa&s;ioned them.</P>
<P>After a thou&s;and prote&s;tations of inviolable affection and fidelity, a thou&s;and adieus, interrupted by our &s;ighs, and prolonged by our apprehen&s;ions, Grammont, dropping on his knees, and holding both my hands, which he bathed with his tears, pronounced this &s;olemn farewel: "Almighty God!
<PB N="35" REF="024442_0034_0FC73B6FD91CC988">
the protector of virtue and innocence, protect and ble&s;s my Adelaide; and grant that the &s;troke of death alone may divide two hearts, which from this moment are eternally devoted to each other." He aro&s;e, cla&s;ped me to his bo&s;om, which &s;eemed bur&s;t|ing with the violence of his emotions, and ha&s;tily withdrew.</P>
<P>There was no need for pretending indi&s;po&s;i|tion, in order to account for my retiring to my apartment; I was indeed violently ill for &s;ome hours. In the morning, however, I aro&s;e, about the time I &s;uppo&s;ed Grammont would &s;et out. From the window of my dre&s;&s;ing-room there was a view of the court-yard. He had once &s;een me there, on occa&s;ion of looking at a beautiful hor&s;e which my brother had purcha&s;ed, and was de&s;irous to &s;hew me. I leaned my aching head again&s;t the &s;hutter, which I kept half clo&s;ed for fear of ob&s;ervation: I had not &s;tood long, before the &s;ervant appeared with the hor&s;es; Grammont followed &s;lowly, pale and dejected, with his eyes fixed on the ground; when &s;uddenly recollecting him&s;elf, he &s;topt, and waving his hand for the &s;ervant to go on, he turned towards the window. I ventured to open the &s;hutter; he in&s;tantly perceived me; a blu&s;h over&s;pread his pale cheeks, and cla&s;ping his hands together, he rai&s;ed his fine eyes to heaven; then, turning them on me with a look&mdash;O, Loui&s;a! that had &s;omething I fear of prophetic &s;adne&s;s in it; gave a deep &s;igh, flew to the gate, mounted his hor&s;e, and di&s;appeared in a moment.</P>
<P>Pardon, my friend, this minute detail of cir|cum&s;tances, the recollection of which &s;upports my weak &s;pirits, and forms all my enjoyment.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="024442_0035_0FC73B7280ACDA00">
For three months Grammont contrived to write to me almo&s;t every po&s;t. How &s;oothing, how delightful is that &s;ecret intercour&s;e, to which an at|tachment like ours gives birth! The whole creation, animate and inanimate, &s;eems &s;ub&s;ervient to the happine&s;s of tho&s;e who&s;e hearts love hath joined, but who&s;e hands fortune hath put a&s;under.</P>
<P>Aver&s;e to entru&s;t our &s;ecret with a third per|&s;on, and re&s;olved never to require from any of my dome&s;tics, for my convenience, a violation of that duty which they might plead my example for &s;acri|ficing to their own, I made Grammont addre&s;s his letters under cover to a young lady in the convent; from whence I received them without incurring &s;u&s;picion, as I corre&s;ponded with &s;everal of the boarders.</P>
<P>Ah, my Loui&s;a! how tender, how &s;en&s;ible, how pathetic is the language they breathe! But you &s;hall judge for your&s;elf. The two la&s;t, which I received about a month before leaving St. Ger|mains, I have now in my pocket: Judge of the happine&s;s they afforded me; and oh! tell me, what am I to think of the dreadful &s;ilence by which it has been &s;ucceeded?</P></Q>

<P>How little, my charming Adelaide, do they know of the tender tie which binds our very &s;ouls in one, who dread ab&s;ence as injurious to the ardour and delicacy of real love! Ours has been but &s;hort, yet it has proved, that the right I derive from affec|tion to the undivided heart of the mo&s;t amiable of

women, is &s;till &s;tronger than I could have believed. It has convinced me more than ever, that I love you&mdash;O Adelaide! that I love you with a fondne&s;s, an admiration, an unremitting con&s;tancy, which no words can expre&s;s. Surely, nothing &s;hould di&s;turb me, whil&s;t I read a&s;&s;urances of your happine&s;s, and the mo&s;t enchanting expre&s;&s;ions of your affection; yet, oh, my Adelaide! my heart is a prey to num|berle&s;s anxieties. The di&s;tance that divides us, my dangerous &s;ituation, our circum&s;tances&mdash;yet let me not cruelly add my inquietudes to tho&s;e of my gen|tle love. Hope is the &s;weete&s;t as well as the mo&s;t &s;alutary ingredient in the cup of life. Let us che|ri&s;h hope.</P>
<P>Let us tru&s;t, that the benificent Author of our being, who hath conducted us to each other, and blended our fates in that delightful union in which our chief happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts, will continue our pre|&s;ent felicity, till that period arrive, when age &s;hall ripen both of us for an unreluctant pa&s;&s;age into that world, where love, &s;ecure again&s;t all apprehen&s;ion, is indulged without mea&s;ure and without fear.</P>
<P>The time I employ in reading your letters &s;eems the only valuable portions of my exi&s;tence. Write to me then, my beloved Adelaide, every little plan you form, and every incident that occurs in the execution of it. Think nothing that regards you too trivial for me. It will gratify me in a thou&s;and ways; particularly by a&s;&s;i&s;ting that con&s;tant propen&s;ity of my imagination to accompany you in every &s;ituation. The heavenly bodies are now the only objects which we can behold at the &s;ame time; they are vehicles of a kind of &s;ilent intercour&s;e between tho&s;e who &s;igh at a di&s;tance from each other. Look up, and

remember me at the hour of nine, the la&s;t we &s;pent together. I will not fail, at the &s;ame hour, to think of my Adelaide, and fervently commend her to the protection of Heaven.</P>
<P>We have often agreed, that to us there are plea&s;ures even in ab&s;ence, more exqui&s;ite, more re|fined than any of tho&s;e which bear that name in the world. What then, O Adelaide! will be our feli|city when we meet?&mdash;When, every anxious care and apprehen&s;ion bani&s;hed from our hearts, they &s;hall glow with the con&s;tant aim, the delightful con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of rendering each other completely happy?</P>
<P>If the&s;e expectations are romantic and extra|vagant, time alone can correct them; for rea&s;on a&s;&s;ures me, that there is no wi&s;h my heart can form, which the merit and tenderne&s;s of the mo&s;t excel|lent of women is not capable of fulfilling.</P>
<P>Farewel! Let us &s;upport each other with re|flecting, that every hour is le&s;&s;ening the period that divides us, whil&s;t it is adding &s;trength to that de|lightful tenderne&s;s which &s;hall bind us to each other for ever.</P>

<P>While Loui&s;a was peru&s;ing this letter, a lay-&s;i&s;ter entered ha&s;tily, and acquainted Adelaide, that a young man, in the habit of a dome&s;tic, demanded to &s;ee her alone, and was waiting in the parlour.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="024442_0039_0FC73B7E15C1D300">
Loui&s;a put the letter in her pocket, and was about to retire, but Adelaide entreated her to accompany her to the grate, as &s;he found her&s;elf &s;eized with &s;o univer&s;al a tremour, that &s;he could hardly walk, and was afraid of fainting. Mi&s;s Seymour &s;upported her friend into the parlour; on entering which, they perceived a genteel young man, in a &s;uit of plain clothes, with who&s;e face, though concealed in part by a handkerchief, Adelaide thought &s;he was not entirely unacquainted.</P>
<P>On &s;eeing Loui&s;a, he pau&s;ed, as if aver&s;e to com|municate his me&s;&s;age before any witne&s;s. Adelaide gue&s;&s;ed the cau&s;e of his &s;ilence: This is my friend, &s;ir, &s;aid &s;he, you may acquaint me with your com|mands without he&s;itation.</P>
<P>He moved towards the grate; and pre&s;enting a letter to Adelaide, with inimitable grace, "I am &s;orry, Madam," &s;aid he, in a low voice, "to be the bearer of this: I wi&s;h the contents could have been for ever concealed from you; but that cannot be.

<P>The young man retired; but the a&s;toni&s;hment into which his words and manner had plunged the two friends, left them neither power to detain, nor re&s;olution to interrogate him concerning their my|&s;terious meaning. Adelaide unfolded the letter, from which &s;omething dropt on the ground, which her agitation prevented her from ob&s;erving.

Afraid of being ob&s;erved in this di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;itua|tion, Loui&s;a rai&s;ed her friend from the ground, in order to convey her to her cell. At that moment &s;he ob&s;erved the billet which had dropt out of the letter, and which &s;he immediately &s;lipt into her pocket.

In truth, &s;he knew not to rea&s;on, though exqui&s;itely to feel; and the &s;ilence of her &s;ympathy produced that effect on the heart of Adelaide, which neither religion nor philo&s;ophy for &s;ome time could have wrought.

<P>Her young fellow-traveller had experienced much happier effects from change of climate; the pain in his &s;ide, occa&s;ioned by the fall, had entirely left him, and his impatience to return &s;eemed to equal Mrs. Seymour's.</P>
<P>It originated, however, from a &s;ecret and very different cau&s;e. The humane attentions be&s;towed on him by her charming daughter, at a time when the dejected &s;pirits and &s;oftened heart are particu|larly &s;en&s;ible to kindne&s;s, had made a la&s;ting impre&s;|&s;ion on Mr. Stanhope's; and e&s;teem and admira|tion combined with gratitude to in&s;pire him with a pa&s;&s;ion, which he was at no pains to &s;uppre&s;s, be|cau&s;e he was con&s;cious of nothing which &s;hould have oppo&s;ed his indulging it.</P>
<P>At length the day was fixed, on which the un|fortunate and afflicted Adelaide was to enter tho&s;e &s;acred walls, which, like the grave, were for ever
<PB N="46" REF="024442_0045_0FC73B96E7DE8B00">
to conceal her &s;orrows; Happy, if like the grave they could have bani&s;hed the remembrance of them.</P>
<P>The travellers ha&s;tened their departure from Montpellier, that they might witne&s;s the awful ce|remony; Loui&s;a found this a &s;evere trial to her weak &s;pirits, as the concour&s;e of nobility a&s;&s;embled for that purpo&s;e was very great. Madame Main|tenon, as abbe&s;s, had a &s;eat placed near the altar, round which the young prince&s;&s;es attended. Mi&s;s Seymour was allowed to &s;upport her affectionate friend during the whole ceremony. She alone knew what need &s;he had of &s;upport. The &s;olemn &s;ervice began:&mdash;The pealing organ, re&s;pon&s;ive to the en|chanting voices of the chori&s;ters, alternately di&s;|&s;olved the &s;oul in tenderne&s;s, elevated it with hope, or rapt it in adoration and prai&s;e.&mdash;The mu&s;ic cea&s;|ed: The prayers of all pre&s;ent were reque&s;ted to aid tho&s;e of the young &s;aint; and the grace of the Mo&s;t High implored to animate her faith, and con|firm her re&s;olutions.</P>
<P>The prie&s;t aro&s;e an conducted her to the door of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> where &s;he was to be &s;tripped of all tho&s;e ornaments with which, as is cu&s;tomary, her friends had richly adorned her for the occa&s;ion. A &s;olemn and affecting &s;ilence en&s;ued. The lovely victim re|turned, clad in her di&s;mal habit, and walking &s;tea|dily up to the altar, kneeled before it to receive the veil.</P>
<P>One proof only remained to &s;hew her fixed re&s;o|lution of renouncing the vanities of the world, and to complete the ceremony of her dedication;&mdash;that of parting with her fine hair, which flowed in abun|dance over her neck and &s;houlders, and &s;haded a
<PB N="47" REF="024442_0046_0FC73B98701835C8">
face, who&s;e beauty the traces of recent affliction had rendered un&s;peakably touching. As &s;he bent her head forward for this purpo&s;e, with a look of patient and peaceful re&s;ignation, &s;he was &s;tartled by a heavy groan, which proceeded from the galle|ry appointed for tho&s;e who were only &s;pectators of this &s;olemnity.</P>
<P>A bu&s;tle en&s;ued, which directed the eyes of all towards the gallery. Her's in&s;tantly recognized there the face of the Count de Rochelle, who, yielding to his extreme curio&s;ity to behold this af|fecting &s;cene, felt him&s;elf &s;o violently agitated with the &s;ight of Adelaide, and recollection of her mi&s;|fortunes, that he fainted in the arms of young Stan|hope, whom chance had placed next him.</P>
<P>Various were the conjectures occa&s;ioned by this accident: The effect produced by it on the mind of Adelaide, is not to be de&s;cribed. She alone knew the nature of tho&s;e &s;entiments which occa&s;ioned it, and her grateful, though oppre&s;&s;ed heart, &s;ighed in &s;ympathy with that of the generous and compa&s;&s;i|onate Rochelle. The interruption to the ceremo|ny cau&s;ed by this affair, gave her time a little to re|cover her&s;elf, and &s;he went through the remaining part of it with tolerable compo&s;ure.</P>
<P>As nothing is &s;o irk&s;ome to a mind in deep afflic|tion, as the exertion nece&s;&s;ary for mixing with an un|feeling world, Adelaide found the &s;olitude of a con|vent not only agreeable but &s;alutary. The con&s;ola|tions of religion operated there with full force, and knowing how prone the mind is, after being vio|lently agitated with pa&s;&s;ion, to &s;ink into li&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, &s;he endeavoured to occupy her time with &s;uch em|ployments
<PB N="48" REF="024442_0047_0FC73B99C7B54828">
and amu&s;ements as recommended them|&s;elves at once by their novelty and importance. By degrees, the gloom of misfortune was exchanged for the &s;erenity of hope; and though &s;he &s;eldom ta&s;ted of plea&s;ure, peace became the con&s;tant in|mate of her bo&s;om.</P>
<P>A few days after &s;eeing her friend pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;t, Mi&s;s Seymour took a la&s;t affecting farewel of St. Cire, and its beloved inhabitants. We feel a &s;ort of &s;acred enthu&s;ia&s;m for the place, where fir&s;t our tender pa&s;|&s;ions have been awakened. The angui&s;h &s;he felt on bidding Adelaide adieu, was extreme; but it was &s;oon in great mea&s;ure obliterated, by fear and anx|iety about her mother, who&s;e wor&s;t &s;ymptoms now recurred with redoubled violence.</P>
<P>During their journey to Calais, young Stanhope had an opportunity of repaying the former attentions of Mi&s;s Seymour, and of &s;hewing the goodne&s;s of his own heart, whil&s;t every day increa&s;ed his admi|ration of her's.</P>
<P>The ab&s;ence of her friend was now &s;everely felt by Loui&s;a; and as they were obliged to remain &s;ome days at Calais to recruit Mrs. Seymour, &s;he employed every &s;pare moment in communicating to her the di&s;tre&s;s with which &s;he was overwhelmed.</P>

<P>My heart &s;hares tenderly in the di&s;tre&s;s of my friend; but alas! I am neither qualified by years nor experience to be her conductre&s;s through the difficult mazes of life. I am not yet arrived at that bli&s;sful tranquillity on which you congratulate me. Officious memory &s;till awakens &s;uch dear, yet dan|gerous recollections, as convey to my &s;oul all the bitterne&s;s of di&s;appointed hope. Oh, Loui&s;a! there is a charm in loving and being beloved, in feeling one's &s;elf the continual &s;ource of joy and happine&s;s to the object of one's be&s;t and mo&s;t tender affections, that takes &s;uch hold of the imagination, as none of the &s;ub|&s;equent evils of life have power to obliterate. Experi|ence
<PB N="50" REF="024442_0049_0FC73BA43A7EEA20">
has taught me too, that the heart will continue to &s;igh, even after the &s;oul is re&s;igned. Ah, my friend! what arrow pierces &s;o deep, what wound bleeds &s;o often, what angui&s;h la&s;ts &s;o long, as that occa&s;ioned by the death of tho&s;e we love? With what a tender mixture of plea&s;ure and regret do we dwell on their virtues; with what eagerne&s;s li&s;ten to their prai&s;e; whil&s;t fame does ju&s;tice to their me|rit, and envy is &s;ilent, for there is no competition in the grave? Grammont! tears are the only tribute I can pay to thy merit; tears, due to youth, virtue, and bravery! Common laurels wither and decay, but that which is &s;upplied and watered by &s;uch a &s;tream &s;hall never fade; it towers above the &s;kies, and flouri&s;hes to immortality.</P>
<P>Do not, my Loui&s;a, covet a life of &s;eclu&s;ion from the world; we ought ever to be contented with the &s;tation allotted us by Providence. In re|tirement, we po&s;&s;e&s;s at be&s;t a kind of negative virtue: There our affections langui&s;h for want of proper objects to excite them; and our goodne&s;s con&s;i&s;ts rather in the ab&s;ence of evil, than in any po&s;itive habits of rectitude or exertions of benevolence. It is in &s;ociety alone that the genuine character can be a&s;|certained. There, our virtue is tried; and if it &s;tands the te&s;t, from that trial re&s;ults our highe&s;t intellectual enjoyment,&mdash;the plea&s;ing con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;uperior worth, and the la&s;ting meed of &s;elf-approbation.</P>
<P>Philo&s;ophy, my dear Loui&s;a, may enable us to talk of fortitude, but religion empowers us to exer|ci&s;e it. Think often, my afflicted friend, on that glo|rious period, when freed from the mi&s;t of error, the perplexity of doubt, and the &s;ophi&s;try of pa&s;&s;ion, we &s;hall contemplate with a&s;toni&s;hment, and acquie&s;ce

<P>We &s;hall now leave the travellers to pur&s;ue their journey, which they did by very &s;low &s;tages, and return to give &s;ome account of what pa&s;&s;ed at the Ca&s;tle of Ha&s;tings during their ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>The frequent letters Lady Granville received from Loui&s;a, and which &s;he generally communica|ted to Lord Granville, &s;erved agreeably to amu&s;e their winter evenings, and to increa&s;e their e&s;teem and affection for the amiable writer. The admirable de&s;criptions they contained, of the curio&s;ities of Pa|ris and its environs, and the reflections blended with them, &s;hewed, that while Mi&s;s Seymour &s;uf|fered nothing worthy of curio&s;ity to e&s;cape her no|tice, &s;he made objects of &s;entiment her chief &s;tudy, and from them derived her highe&s;t enjoyment.</P>
<P>The Marquis of Winche&s;ter, who had a fine &s;eat in that neighbourhood, came with his daughter, La|dy Charlotte Villiers, to re&s;ide there during the au|tumn, about the time Mrs. Seymour and her daugh|ter &s;et out for France. Lord and Lady Granville waited on the Marquis and Lady Charlotte, and reque&s;ted the favour of their company at the Ca&s;tle. As they did not propo&s;e returning to London till after Chri&s;tmas, they &s;pent mo&s;t of their time there. The Marquis's fortune was inadequate to his rank, which induced him to &s;pend much of his time in
<PB N="52" REF="024442_0051_0FC73BA7384DB628">
the country; as his &s;trict notions of honour forbade his plunging into expence, which he knew mu&s;t either ruin his family or injure &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Lady Charlotte po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;o many advantages from nature, that &s;he &s;eemed in no want of tho&s;e of fortune. To a fine per&s;on, and a good under|&s;tanding, &s;he added &s;uch a &s;hare of vivacity and poli&s;hed manners, as rendered her one of the mo&s;t agreeable companions in the world. Lord Gran|ville beheld in Lady Charlotte the very woman he wi&s;hed for a daughter-in-law; and entertained lit|tle doubt of obtaining the approbation of the Mar|quis to a marriage, which, in re&s;pect of fortune, was all he could de&s;ire for his daughter. Con&s;ci|ous, however, of the waywardne&s;s of the human heart, he deferred communicating his plan to his &s;on, till he &s;hould &s;ee the young people on &s;uch a footing of intimacy, as &s;hould give room to hope for their concurrence with it.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the following letter from his father, Lord Ha&s;tings returned to the Ca&s;tle, about a month before the arrival of the travellers.</P>
<P>"Though I wi&s;hed my dear Henry to have made a longer &s;tay at Cambridge, an accident has hap|pened which obliges me to reque&s;t his immediate return home. Dr. Melville, who has been lately threatened with a decline, has, at my de&s;ire, agreed to give up his academy, and attend you on your tour. As he fears ri&s;king next winter in our north|ern climate, I propo&s;e that you &s;hall &s;et out in a few months hence, and wi&s;h to enjoy your &s;ociety during the &s;ummer. Be&s;ides, I would wi&s;h to in|troduce you to &s;ome of the neighbouring families, many of whom are highly re&s;pectable; and to in|&s;pire
<PB N="53" REF="024442_0052_0FC73BB0A016AD08">
you with that preference for your own coun|try that will di&s;po&s;e you to return to it with plea|&s;ure."</P>
<P>On his arrival, Lord Ha&s;tings found the Marquis and his daughter at the Ca&s;tle. Wholly ignorant of his father's views, and free from that embarra&s;&s;|ing con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s which the pre&s;ence of Mi&s;s Sey|mour had occa&s;ioned, he appeared with all the ad|vantages of a fine per&s;on, a cultivated mind, elegant manners, and a mo&s;t engaging addre&s;s.</P>
<P>Lady Charlotte was perfectly qualified to judge of his merit. Notwith&s;tanding of her early intro|duction into the gay world, her good &s;en&s;e had pre|&s;erved her from adopting its follies; whil&s;t, by mix|ing with it, &s;he had acquired a degree of frankne&s;s and ea&s;e peculiarly agreeable to a temper like that of Lord Ha&s;tings. Her con&s;tant good humour and vivacity made him find a thou&s;and charms in her &s;ociety; and as &s;he excelled in mu&s;ic, an art in which he had made con&s;iderable progre&s;s, and of which he was greatly enamoured, their time pa&s;&s;ed mo&s;t agreeably.</P>
<P>One morning, when Lord Granville and his &s;on were together in his &s;tudy, concerting the plan of his future travels, he addre&s;&s;ed him in the following manner:&mdash;<Q>My dear Henry, I will not deny you the plea&s;ure of knowing, that hitherto your con|duct has been &s;uch, as affords me the mo&s;t real &s;atisfaction. To complete it, one object only re|mains, that of &s;eeing you marry, and form &s;uch an alliance as will do credit both to your judgment and your heart. I know, by experience, that the whole happine&s;s of life depends on this con|nection.
<PB N="54" REF="024442_0053_0FC73BB1BA955468">
I do not con&s;ider my &s;elf as authori&s;ed to con&s;train your choice, but, as your friend, would wi&s;h to direct it. Lady Charlotte Villiers appears to me both worthy and agreeable; her birth is &s;uit|able to your own; and if I am not mi&s;taken, your merit has not been beheld by her with indifference.</Q></P>
<P>Lord Ha&s;tings expre&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t lively &s;en&s;e of his father's goodne&s;s, and joined very cordially in prai&s;e of Lady Charlotte, who, together with the Marquis, was that very moment announced by a &s;ervant. He flew to hand her from her carriage; but the conver&s;ation which had ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed, gave an awkward con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s to his manner, which did not e&s;cape the penetrating eyes of Lady Charlotte, who felt her&s;elf too deeply intere&s;ted in all his feel|ings, to permit the &s;lighte&s;t of them to pa&s;s unob|&s;erved.</P>
<P>She rallied him with much &s;pirit and good hu|mour on the vi&s;ible change in his manner. And after a variety of &s;prightly &s;allies, <Q>Come, come, &s;aid &s;he, I will not que&s;tion you any farther on this &s;ubject, for I &s;uppo&s;e your father has been catechi&s;ing you &s;ufficiently already, as I &s;aw you come out of his &s;tudy ju&s;t now.</Q> The face of Lord Ha&s;tings was crim&s;oned over by this &s;peech, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ed at once to increa&s;e his embarra&s;&s;ment and Lady Charlotte's curio&s;ity. She was too well bred, however, to per&s;i&s;t in her raillery, which &s;he &s;aw produce &s;uch vi&s;ible emotion in Lord Ha&s;tings. But though &s;everal topics were &s;tarted, the conver|&s;ation grew languid; and on returning home, Lady Charlotte bewildered her&s;elf in vainly &s;triving to unravel the my&s;tery of his behaviour. As we are prone to believe what we wi&s;h, and as Lord Ha&s;|tings
<PB N="55" REF="024442_0054_0FC73BB3C39D2FA8">
had been uncommonly a&s;&s;iduous about this Lady, &s;he hardly doubted of having made an im|pre&s;&s;ion on a heart who&s;e affections &s;he &s;incerely wi&s;hed to engage. But though his vi&s;its were as frequent as ever, the ea&s;e of his manner was ex|changed for a caution which was unnatural at his time of life, and foreign to his character, and which threw a con&s;traint into all their conver&s;ations, high|ly prejudicial to tho&s;e &s;entiments which Lady Char|lotte felt and wi&s;hed to in&s;pire.</P>
<P>Things were in this train when Mrs. Seymour and her daughter arrived at Springwood.</P>
<P>Lady Granville flew to welcome her friend, but, alas! &s;he knew not in what terms to &s;peak that welcome, when &s;he beheld in her pale face and emaciated figure, every &s;ymptom of approaching di&s;&s;olution.</P>
<P>Tears of mingled tenderne&s;s and grief bedewed the bo&s;om of Loui&s;a, as Lady Granville pre&s;&s;ed her to her affectionate heart. She did not attempt to deceive her with vain hopes, but to arm her with fortitude and re&s;ignation.</P>
<P>As Loui&s;a never quitted her mother's apartment, Lord Ha&s;tings had no opportunity of gratifying his curio&s;ity, which was become painfully ardent, by the daily encomiums be&s;towed by his mother, both on the mind and per&s;on of Mi&s;s Seymour; the lat|ter of which, &s;he &s;aid, had acquired inexpre&s;&s;ible graces, whil&s;t at the &s;ame time &s;he had lo&s;t nothing of that amiable ingenuity and &s;implicity of manners which was her greate&s;t charm.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="024442_0055_0FC73BB5F6A83000">
The anxious mind of Loui&s;a was &s;oothed, &s;oon after her arrival, by the following letter from her friend:</P>

<P>Deprived of your dear &s;ociety, Loui&s;a, I have recour&s;e to the pa&s;t.

Mrs. Seymour's illne&s;s increa&s;ed &s;o quickly, that a few weeks brought her to the verge of the grave.

<P>Mrs. Seymour only &s;urvived a week after this conver&s;ation, during which &s;he &s;trove to recon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">e Loui&s;a to a &s;eparation, which would confe&s;&s;edly be for her happine&s;s.</P>

&s;orrow for my death! Con&s;ider it in the light of a &s;hort ab&s;ence;&mdash;look on me as having gone a little before in a journey in which you are &s;oon to follow me. Perhaps our &s;eparation will neither be &s;o real nor entire, as that occa&s;i|oned by ab&s;ence while on earth: Perhaps I may &s;till be permitted to watch over my child; at lea&s;t I will not long be disjoined from her.</P>
<P>There was &s;omething un&s;peakably &s;oothing in the idea &s;ugge&s;ted by the la&s;t part of this di&s;cour&s;e: Loui&s;a dwelt on it with peculiar delight; but, in the mid&s;t of the extreme dejection occa&s;ioned by the &s;olemnity of a death-bed, her drooping heart required a firmer &s;upport than a plea&s;ing dream or a doubtful hope. Her mother perceived this; and in directing her to the light of revelation and the pro&s;pect of immortality, gave patience to her &s;uffer|ings, and mingled con&s;olation with her &s;orrows.</P>
<P>"I leave you, my beloved child," &s;aid &s;he, a few hours before her death; but I leave you under the protection of that God who &s;ees it good for us to part; who is in a peculiar manner the Fa|ther of the fatherle&s;s, and &s;hield of the orphan.</P>
<P>Earthly friends fail us at our greate&s;t need; but this heavenly Friend will never for&s;ake us. Earthly friends can only pity our misfortunes; but God is able to avert them. Fear God, then, my deare&s;t child, and you need have no other fear.</P>
<P>Though the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of grief on the death of her mother prevented Loui&s;a from deriving all that con&s;olation from the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es which they
<PB N="60" REF="024442_0059_0FC73BC176E02820">
were calculated to in&s;pire, they returned to her thoughts in the calmer hours, when pa&s;&s;ion began to &s;ub&s;ide, and carried the &s;weete&s;t con&s;olation to her heart.</P>
<P>Lady Granville was very de&s;irous that Mi&s;s Sey|mour &s;hould return with her to the Ca&s;tle the even|ing her mother expired; but &s;he would by no means con&s;ent to leave Springwood, till &s;he had fulfilled the la&s;t duties to her re&s;pected parent. That humane friend did not urge her, but, revering her pious &s;orrows, left her a while in quiet to in|dulge them; and &s;ending for her own maid, a pru|dent &s;en&s;ible woman, to attend her, returned to the Ca&s;tle to give orders for the funeral, which Loui&s;a intreated might be as private as po&s;&s;ible. Accord|ingly in three days afterwards, the corps was in|terred early in the morning, in a burial-place erect|ed by his lady on the death of Colonel Seymour.</P>
<P>Nothing could be more &s;oothing to the afflicted Loui&s;a, than the frequent letters &s;he received from Adelaide during her di&s;tre&s;s. When the dark clouds of adver&s;ity &s;urround us, they exclude every ray of plea&s;ure, but that which reaches and cheers the &s;oul from tender and &s;incere &s;ympathy.</P>
<P>The following was brought her the evening of that day which deprived her of the be&s;t of mothers.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mi&s;s Seymour.</HEAD>
<P>The &s;tillne&s;s and quiet of my pre&s;ent &s;ituation grows every day more agreeable. Methinks, Lou|i&s;a, at the age of twenty-two, I feel a &s;trong convic|tion, that <HI>all is vanity,</HI> as Solomon did after a long
<PB N="61" REF="024442_0060_0FC73BCAEE8AF678">
life, in which all the wi&s;hes of his heart and pow|ers of his imagination were exhau&s;ted, in pur&s;uit of a felicity, which, alas! the&s;e &s;hadows of real good could never yield.</P>
<P>Affliction, I tru&s;t, has taught me true wi&s;dom. It has brought upon me a &s;ort of premature old age, which &s;erves in&s;tead of experience. Though neither &s;atiated with the plea&s;ures of the world, nor di&s;gu&s;ted by its di&s;appointments, I &s;hall ri&s;e &s;atisfied from life's fea&s;t, and leave the banquet to tho&s;e for whom it has the charm of novelty, and who&s;e igno|rance of its dangers makes them behold it with de&s;ire.</P>
<P>With what calm indifference, Loui&s;a! do I mark the &s;ilent lap&s;e of time, and behold its &s;everal periods come to a clo&s;e! Why &s;hould we indulge immoderate &s;orrow for the lo&s;s of tho&s;e who are gone before us, when every day, every hour, every moment, is accelerating the bli&s;sful period of our re|union?</P>
<P>Books are now my chief amu&s;ement: Some of the&s;e repre&s;ent life as bright and cheerful; others teach me to de&s;pi&s;e its &s;torms, or inform me that they are &s;alutary; whil&s;t experience adds, that they are tran&s;ient too. Methinks this con&s;ideration ought to &s;ilence both our peevi&s;h di&s;contents and fanta&s;tic wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>Sometimes I direct my &s;olitary walks to the &s;i|lent man&s;ions of the dead; and, forgetful of the world, and all its vexing inquietudes, &s;eem to &s;hare for a while their bli&s;sful repo&s;e. But I advance a

<P>Here is evinced, the amazing truth, that it is the &s;ame matter, variou&s;ly modified, which con&s;ti|tutes both the earth and its inhabitants. Animals derive their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence from plants, which are nou|ri&s;hed by the common mould; at the appointed &s;ea&s;on all the&s;e return to this their fir&s;t principle. But &s;ince, in the vi&s;ible creation, there exi&s;ts no|thing analogous to mind, let us not imagine that the &s;oul can ever be reduced to a &s;tate like that of beings which are altogether different from it.&mdash;Themes like the&s;e, my Loui&s;a, cannot fail to be in harmony with your pre&s;ent feelings, &s;ince your la&s;t letters a&s;&s;ure me that your dear de&s;erving parent is pa&s;t all hope of recovery. Let reflections like the&s;e &s;upport your &s;oul in view of that afflicting event which either awaits you, or is already arrived. Oh, my Loui&s;a! how much need have I to dwell on them my&s;elf! This day completes my twenty-&s;e|cond year, the mo&s;t eventful of my life. How lit|tle did I dream, at its commencement, that the fa|bric my fond hopes had reared was &s;o &s;oon to tum|ble into ruins! That he, for who&s;e &s;ake alone I welcomed its arrival, and wi&s;hed its continuance, &s;hould, ere its clo&s;e, be torn from my bo&s;om, and hidden for ever from my eyes! But though the&s;e bodily organs no more behold thee, be&s;t and dear|e&s;t of men! thou art ever pre&s;ent to my mind's eye, in thy exalted virtues, thy &s;potle&s;s manners, and thy fair fame: The&s;e &s;hall ju&s;tify the tears with which I embalm thy memory, and convert my &s;orrows into virtue.</P>

Write con&s;tantly to me, my amiable, afflicted friend! You know how tenderly I partake in your &s;orrows. Believe me, Loui&s;a, to &s;often one pang of yours, even at the expence of &s;haring it, will be preferable, in my e&s;timation, to all that the world calls plea&s;ure.</P>

<P>Your letter has reached me, my friend, and conveyed to my &s;oul the only con&s;olation of which at pre&s;ent it is capable. Ye&s;terday, all my cares for the be&s;t of women ended;&mdash;&s;he is happy:&mdash;Shall I not then be re&s;igned?&mdash;I tru&s;t I am &s;o. Yet, oh, my Adelaide! it is difficult, it is impo&s;&s;ible, to re&s;train the tears of nature, when the long endear|ed &s;acred tie of kindred and of friend&s;hip is rudely broken by death! Till that cruel moment, when the grave clo&s;es over tho&s;e we love, we cannot &s;uf|ficiently admire the excellence of that religion which teaches us to look beyond it. Ah, my friend, do they act agreeably to their own principles, who contend for the dignity of human nature, and yet believe that the &s;oul of man&mdash;advancing daily in virtue and knowledge&mdash;a&s;piring after perfection&mdash;longing for immortality&mdash;cut off in the mid&s;t of its pur&s;uits and wi&s;hes,&mdash;&s;hall &s;hare the &s;ame fate with the meane&s;t reptile that crawls on the face of the earth?</P>
<P>Alas! how di&s;mal, how hopele&s;s, mu&s;t be the &s;orrow of &s;uch gloomy, &s;uch benighted minds!</P>
<P>Books, you &s;ay, &s;upply your favourite amu&s;e|ment. Our opinion, both of books and characters,
<PB N="64" REF="024442_0063_0FC73BCEF69BDFA8">
is influenced by the tone of our mind at the time we become acquainted with them. Perhaps it is owing to this circum&s;tance that I have peru&s;ed the following fable with peculiar &s;atisfaction this morn|ing; and in the hope of its producing the &s;ame effect on you, I &s;hall here tran&s;cribe it.</P>
<P>In ancient times, &s;ays the fabuli&s;t, when the Creator of the world placed our fir&s;t parents in Pa|radi&s;e, to p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">vent them from growing weary of each other, he appointed Happine&s;s, the faire&s;t of his offspring, to re&s;ide with them.</P>
<P>For &s;ome time her charms were beheld with admiration, and her merit treated with re&s;pect. But beauty, by growing familiar, cea&s;ed to excite plea|&s;ure; and merit, from want of novelty, &s;oon in|curred neglect. The favourite, even of cele&s;tial beings, Happine&s;s, could ill brook &s;o unkind a re|ception from mortals; and one day, on occa&s;ion of a quarrel between her a&s;&s;ociates, in which they both betrayed marks of altered di&s;po&s;itions, &s;he was &s;o di&s;gu&s;ted, that &s;he ha&s;tily bade them adieu; and a&s;cending to her former abode, entreated the great Ruler of the Univer&s;e that &s;he might never more be &s;ent to dwell with tho&s;e who knew &s;o ill to va|lue her &s;ociety.</P>
<P>The moment &s;he was gone, her companions became &s;en&s;ible of their error. They deplored her ab&s;ence, and conjured her to return, in terms of the mo&s;t earne&s;t &s;upplication. But Happine&s;s was inexorable; and the utmo&s;t they could obtain from her, was a promi&s;e, that, provided they were never again heard to quarrel, &s;he would depute her young|er

&s;i&s;ter, Contentment, to re&s;ide with them, and even occa&s;ionally vi&s;it them her&s;elf.</P>
<P>How far our primogenitors complied with the&s;e terms, we are &s;till ignorant; but it would appear that Happine&s;s, like other injured females, not only continued to re&s;ent former ill-u&s;age, but even entertained con&s;tant &s;u&s;picions of future mal|treatment. For it is univer&s;ally known, that when|ever &s;he deigns to vi&s;it the&s;e lower regions, &s;he ne|ver &s;tays longer than, ju&s;t like tho&s;e mortals who pretend to emulate her perfections, to receive the homage of her admirers, to make a di&s;play of her charms, and by be&s;towing &s;ome &s;light favours on each, to heighten the de&s;ires and &s;ecure the admira|tion of all her votaries.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Immediately after the funeral, Lady Granville prepared to go to Springwood, in order to bring her young charge to the Ca&s;tle. But the agitating &s;cenes &s;he had lately witne&s;&s;ed, and the lo&s;s of a friend &s;he dearly loved, had &s;o &s;en&s;ibly affected her health, that, ju&s;t as &s;he was &s;tepping into the coach, &s;he was &s;eized with &s;uch a faintne&s;s, that it was with difficulty Lord Ha&s;tings could get her &s;upport|ed back to her apartment. Unwilling to add af|fliction to the oppre&s;&s;ed heart of Loui&s;a, and flat|tering her&s;elf this indi&s;po&s;ition would quickly go off, &s;he &s;ent a note to acquaint her, that &s;he was prevented from coming for her at that hour, as &s;he intended, but would certainly call for her in the evening, when &s;he expected to find every thing in readine&s;s to be moved to her apartment at the Ca&s;tle, where &s;he &s;hould &s;till find a tender indulg|ent mother, ready with open arms to receive her.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="024442_0065_0FC73BD988462A00">
The la&s;t &s;entence di&s;&s;olved the whole &s;oul of Loui|&s;a in gratitude and tenderne&s;s, and gave birth to a thou&s;and ideas, which, though confu&s;ed and indi&s;|tinct, left no traces but &s;uch as were plea&s;ing. She ha&s;tened to prepare for her removal; and expecting Lady Granville every minute, took out her mo|ther's picture, bathed it with her tears, and implo|red the Almighty to enable her to tread in the &s;teps of his departed &s;ervant!</P>
<P>It was now the beginning of May; the air was perfectly mild, and the beautiful woods and mea|dows were gilded with the la&s;t trembling rays of the &s;un. It di&s;appeared; and was &s;ucceeded by that &s;erene glowing &s;ky which marks the evenings of that enchanting &s;ea&s;on with peculiar beauty.</P>
<P>Loui&s;a, from the window of her mother's apart|ment, had long contemplated this &s;cene; if it did not bani&s;h her &s;orrows, at lea&s;t it becalmed and &s;oothed them. She had marked the brightly &s;etting &s;un, and traced in her mind a plea&s;ing re&s;emblance between the progre&s;s of that heavenly orb and that of a good life. The departure of that bright lumi|nary in&s;pired feelings perfectly congenial with tho&s;e impre&s;&s;ed on her mind by the &s;cenes &s;he had lately witne&s;&s;ed. After cheering this world with his beams, &s;aid &s;he, and diffu&s;ing health and beau|ty around him, this glorious image of his Maker retires, perhaps, to renew his &s;trength, and ble&s;s other regions. But the compari&s;on would ex|tend no farther. A few hours would re&s;tore to the eyes of men the cheering light of the world; but, with a pang almo&s;t in&s;upportable, &s;he recol|lected, that her eyes mu&s;t no more behold the pa|rent &s;he &s;o fondly loved.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="024442_0066_0FC73BDB0AD72580">
Re&s;olved, before quitting Springwood, to vi&s;it her lowly dwelling, &s;he pa&s;&s;ed, unnoticed, through the garden, and opening a door which led into the park, walked &s;lowly towards the burial-place. The &s;ilence which prevailed around, the deepening &s;hades of evening, and the &s;udden ri&s;ing of the moon from behind a cloud, which gave an indi&s;tinct appear|ance to almo&s;t every object, affected her weak &s;pi|rits &s;o much, that &s;he &s;topt, and for &s;ome moments he&s;itated about going forward; but, recollecting how &s;eldom &s;he might find &s;o favourable an oppor|tunity of indulging her &s;olemn meditations, &s;he en|tered the little inclo&s;ure, and, kneeling at the &s;ide of the grave, &s;trove to rai&s;e her thoughts from the gloomy object before her, and to fix them on tho&s;e which &s;he felt convey peace and even joy to her &s;oul.</P>
<P>She continued &s;ome moments in this attitude when, &s;tarting at the ru&s;tling of a bu&s;h behind her, &s;he ha&s;tly aro&s;e, and, turning towards the door, ex|claimed,&mdash;"All gracious Heaven! Lord Ha&s;tings!"</P>
<P>Terrified beyond expre&s;&s;ion with his &s;udden and unexpected appearance, &s;he fell livele&s;s on the grave of her mother. Reduced almo&s;t to the &s;ame con|dition, the a&s;toni&s;hed Ha&s;tings, kneeling by her &s;ide, endeavoured to rai&s;e her up, and recal her to life. Several minutes elap&s;ed before his cares had the de&s;ired effect. He attempted in vain to offer &s;ome excu&s;e for this intru&s;ion; his words were &s;o incoherent, and Loui&s;a appeared &s;o incapable of attending to them, that he forbore talking. His looks, however, &s;ufficiently expre&s;&s;ed the pertur|bation of his mind, whil&s;t he &s;trove to prevail on her to accept of his arm; by the help of which,
<PB N="68" REF="024442_0067_0FC73BDC847E2580">
with a &s;taggering pace, &s;he walked &s;lowly towards the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the maid was employed in putting Loui&s;a's little wardrobe into the coach, &s;he recollected her|&s;elf &s;o far as to inquire after Lady Granville. Lord Ha&s;tings replied, that being a little indi&s;po&s;ed, &s;he had de&s;ired him to wait on her, and attend her to the Ca&s;tle. "I greatly fear, Mi&s;s Seymour," added he, that my vi&s;it at this time has proved an unwelcome one. Loui&s;a attempted a reply, but the words died on her lips.</P>
<P>They entered the coach; and a &s;ilence en&s;ued, which would have been painfully embarra&s;&s;ing, had not the pre&s;ence of the maid &s;eemed to authori&s;e it.&mdash;When they alighted, Lord Ha&s;tings again pre&s;|&s;ed Loui&s;a to accept of his arm, that he might con|duct her to his mother's apartment; but &s;he declin|ed it, &s;aying, with a tone of the &s;weete&s;t acknow|ledgement, that &s;he thanked his Lord&s;hip, but was now, &s;he believed, able to walk by her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Afraid to witne&s;s a meeting &s;o tender, he retired to his apartment, and took up his pen to indulge the feelings of his heart, by pouring out to his friend.</P>

<P>On enquiring after his mother, Lord Ha&s;tings was informed that &s;he was &s;till greatly indi&s;po&s;ed, and wi&s;hed to &s;ee him. His agitation was not le&s;|&s;ened, when, on entering the room, he beheld Loui&s;a &s;itting by her bed&s;ide, and holding a hand of Lady Granville in her's, which &s;he bathed with her tears. Lord Ha&s;tings approached the bed, and enquiring anxiou&s;ly about her complaints, took hold of the other hand, which he was &s;urpri&s;ed to feel very hot and feveri&s;h. "Henry," &s;aid &s;he, <Q>this dear child has been too much accu&s;tomed of late

<P>Loui&s;a aro&s;e, and walked with Lord Ha&s;tings into the drawing-room; but thought not of the prints. She read his apprehen&s;ions in his dejected countenance; and in&s;tantly catching the alarm, en|treated him to tell her what he thought of Lady Granville's &s;ituation?</P>
<P><Q>Perhaps, Mi&s;s Seymour, &s;aid he, my fears magnify her danger; but at pre&s;ent, &s;he certainly has every &s;ymptom of a fever.

<PB N="72" REF="024442_0071_0FC73BE938C68FA8">
cau&s;e being now removed, he hoped the complaint would neither be formidable nor la&s;ting.</P>
<P>Loui&s;a implored her permi&s;&s;ion to watch by her during the night; but this Lady Granville ab&s;olute|ly refu&s;ed. She retired to her apartment, but not to bed.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as the clock &s;truck one, &s;he ventured to &s;lip &s;oftly down, and li&s;ten at the door of Lady Gran|ville's apartment. Having to pa&s;s that of Lord Ha&s;tings, which he had left open with the &s;ame intention, he &s;aw her go down &s;tairs, and &s;uppo&s;ing his mother grown wor&s;e, followed her in the great|e&s;t agitation. All being quiet, Loui&s;a was return|ing &s;oftly, when &s;he met Lord Ha&s;tings in the pa&s;|&s;age. At &s;ight of him &s;he &s;tarted with &s;urpri&s;e.&mdash;The eagerne&s;s of his enquiries after his mother, the fears he expre&s;&s;ed for her own health, in a tone of peculiar tenderne&s;s, and the earne&s;t manner in which he urged her to go immediately to re&s;t, affected the weak &s;pirits of Loui&s;a in &s;uch a degree, that &s;he could not re&s;train her tears. She pulled out her handkerchief to conceal them, and ha&s;tily retired. By an involuntary movement, he followed her &s;ome &s;teps; as he was &s;lowly returning towards his apart|ment, he &s;aw a &s;lip of paper lying in the pa&s;&s;age, which he picked up without knowing what he did, and laid on his dre&s;&s;ing-table. He &s;at down, and, revolving in his mind the various &s;cenes of the pa&s;t day, found his admiration of Loui&s;a increa&s;e, with every new light in which her exalted character was placed.</P>
<P>He was about to undre&s;s, when the paper caught his eye; he unfolded it, and perceived that it was
<PB N="73" REF="024442_0072_0FC73BF261BB9308">
written in a female hand; and in&s;tantly knew from the contents that it mu&s;t be that of Mi&s;s Seymour. In reality &s;he had dropt it, by pulling her handker|chief quickly out of her pocket.</P>
<P>It was dated midnight; contained the la&s;t words of her mother; and concluded with this &s;olemn addre&s;s: <Q>Almighty God! &s;hield of the orphan, be thou my guide and protector through the dan|gerous paths of life: And having removed from me the be&s;t of parents, &s;pare in mercy the kind|e&s;t of friends!</Q></P>
<P>The piety of Loui&s;a, and tenderne&s;s of her at|tachment to his mother, melted the &s;oul of Lord Ha&s;tings in love and gratitude; nor did her late proofs of his filial piety and &s;olicitude for her &s;afe|ty le&s;s &s;en&s;ibly affect her's. Unable wholly to re|&s;train his emotions, he enclo&s;ed the paper in a bil|let, which contained the&s;e words:&mdash;<Q>This paper, which I found a few hours ago, can belong only to Mi&s;s Seymour. Pardon a curio&s;ity which I found it impo&s;&s;ible to re&s;train: I knew not the hand when I pre&s;umed to read it, but could be at no lo&s;s with regard to the writer.&mdash;O Mi&s;s Seymour! may your prayer be accepted! May you, indeed, be the care of Heaven; and may peace for ever inhabit that gentle bo&s;om, where &s;uch &s;ingular piety re&s;ides!</Q></P>
<P>This letter he pre&s;ented to her unob&s;erved, as &s;he retired from the breakfa&s;ting parlour. The air of &s;ecre&s;y with which it was delivered, alarmed her con&s;cious heart with a variety of confu&s;ed emoti|ons, and it throbbed with &s;uch violence, that it was
<PB N="74" REF="024442_0073_0FC73BF3BB2962C0">
&s;ome minutes, after &s;he reached her apartment, be|fore &s;he found courage to open and read it. When &s;he did &s;o, her eye impatiently &s;ought for &s;omewhat there, which it could not di&s;cover; and &s;he &s;ighed at the clo&s;e of it, without knowing the cau&s;e of her di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>Lady Granville's fever was violent, and her reco|very long doubtful. During that tedious languor which u&s;ually &s;uc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">eds &s;evere illne&s;s, her &s;on and Loui&s;a &s;carcely ever left her apartment. For them it had a thou&s;and &s;weet and &s;ecret attracti|ons;&mdash;united in the &s;ame tender cares, their hearts &s;ympathi&s;ed in the &s;ame delightful emotions. The bitterne&s;s of grief had yielded to the &s;oftne&s;s of m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|lancholy, in the gentle bo&s;om of Loui&s;a, and &s;he experienced a calm &s;o delicious, that &s;he would not have exchanged it for the tumult of plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>This &s;erenity, however, was not of long durati|on: The following letter from Adelaide, in an&s;wer to that one which acquainted her with Mrs. Sey|mour's death, revived in the affectionate heart of Loui&s;a tho&s;e anxious &s;olicitudes to which it had long been &s;ubjected.</P>

<P>'Tis true, amid&s;t the decays of her uncomfort|able man&s;ion, we know that the heavenly inhabit|ant remains unhurt; but as her powers all lie dor|mant, when proper agents are wanting to execute her will, &s;he appears to us to partake in the ruin of her earthly habitation.</P>

<P>Before Lady Granville was able to take an airing in the coach, &s;he was advi&s;ed by Dr. Lewis to be carried into the garden for the benefit of fresh <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> where there was an elegant little pavillion, fitted up in the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite ta&s;te, and which com|manded one of the fine&s;t pro&s;pects in the world. There, whil&s;t Loui&s;a &s;at at work with Lady Gran|ville, or amu&s;ed her&s;elf with training the honey&s;uc|kle and je&s;&s;amine round the windows, Lord Ha&s;tings u&s;ually read aloud. One day he took up a volume of Shake&s;peare, and chance directing him to the <HI>Twelfth Night,</HI> he began to read.</P>
<P>It was impo&s;&s;ible for Loui&s;a not to perceive that there was &s;omething particular in the whole manner of Lord Ha&s;tings towards her; and the various in|cidents of the la&s;t month had left her in no doubt with re&s;pect to the nature of her own &s;entiments. As his expre&s;&s;ions, however, might be all ju&s;tified on the &s;core of friend&s;hip and gratitude, &s;he did not dare to encourage hope, though &s;he often felt the torment of &s;u&s;pen&s;e, and &s;uffered extreme un|ea&s;ine&s;s from the dread of Lord Ha&s;tings entertaining the &s;lighte&s;t &s;u&s;picion of the truth.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="024442_0078_0FC73C2538039980">
As he advanced in the play, &s;he felt her&s;elf great|ly affected. When he came to that pathetic de|&s;cription, "She never told her love," &amp;c. the colour for&s;ook her cheeks, and her heart palpitated with the mo&s;t painful apprehen&s;ions. It in&s;tantly occurred to her, that Lord Ha&s;tings had artfully contrived this method of di&s;covering <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">er real &s;enti|ments;&mdash;the thought was agony.</P>
<P>On pronouncing this &s;entence,&mdash;"A murderous guilt &s;hows not it&s;elf more &s;oon, than love that would &s;eem hid,"&mdash;he &s;topt, he &s;ighed; and venturing to &s;teal a look at Loui&s;a, &s;aw her pale and breathle&s;s, ju&s;t &s;inking from her chair. He flew to her, and catching her in his arms, prevented her from fal|ling. Lady Granville, who was not an unconcerned &s;pectator of this &s;cene, a&s;&s;i&s;ted her &s;on in carrying her out to the air.&mdash;"My love," &s;aid &s;he, <Q>your long confinement in a &s;ick-room, has, I fear, in|jured your health. Indeed, Loui&s;a, the journey to Bath, which Dr. Lewis urges, is not le&s;s ne|ce&s;&s;ary for you than my&s;elf.</Q></P>
<P>From that moment Loui&s;a re&s;olved to keep the &s;tricte&s;t watch over her&s;elf; and con&s;cious of her inability to di&s;&s;emble, to avoid for the future the company of Lord Ha&s;tings, with as much earne&s;t|ne&s;s as &s;he had formerly wi&s;hed for it. He perceived the coldne&s;s and alteration in her manner; but far from &s;u&s;pecting the real cau&s;e, with that diffidence which often accompanies true merit, and always genuine love, he &s;ought for it in his own conduct; &s;ome part of which, though unknown to him&s;elf, he feared had offended her.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="024442_0079_0FC73C26D0AAF3D8">
The con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that haunted Loui&s;a, when in company with him, gave her a feeling &s;o exqui&s;itely painful, that it even threw an air of peevi&s;hne&s;s into her conver&s;ation. When he inquired anxiou&s;ly about her health, it increa&s;ed her angui&s;h and per|plexity, by making her &s;u&s;pect that her &s;ecret di&s;tre&s;s was beco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> apparent; and every attempt to &s;ooth her inquietude, carried in it, to her di&s;ordered ima|gination, the air of an in&s;ult.</P>
<P>Lord Ha&s;tings &s;ought in vain to unravel the my|&s;tery of her behaviour; he was convinced of her indifference; he felt di&s;&s;atisfied and unhappy; but though he knew too well the cau&s;e of his inquie|tude, he was utterly uncon&s;cious of having done any thing to merit the angui&s;h he &s;uffered.</P>

<P>As Bath waters were thought nece&s;&s;ary for re|e&s;tabli&s;hing Lady Granville's health, &s;he prepared to &s;et out with her family, all of whom wi&s;hed to attend her.</P>
<P>About a week before their departure, the Mar|quis of Winche&s;ter and his daughter came to con|gratulate Lady Granville on her recovery, and &s;pend a few days at the Ca&s;tle. Lady Charlotte, who had never &s;een Mi&s;s Seymour before, was &s;o &s;truck with her beauty, that &s;he could not help expre&s;&s;ing her
<PB N="82" REF="024442_0081_0FC73C31F7282DA0">
admiration of it. Her admiration indeed was &s;in|cere, and unmixed with envy; but would probably have been attended with a feeling equally painful, had &s;he not in&s;tantly perceived the coldne&s;s with which Loui&s;a treated Lord Ha&s;tings, and recollect|ed that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he change in his manner took place before her return from France.</P>
<P>Nothing is more common than to &s;ee people of oppo&s;ite tempers become fond of each other. In all connections of the heart, there mu&s;t be a &s;imi|larity in ta&s;te and &s;entiment between the parties; but diver&s;ity of tempers, like diver&s;ity of mu&s;ical tones, &s;erve, when properly combined, to make th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> harmony more complete. The timid and re&s;erved are relieved from the nece&s;&s;ity of any painful exer|tions, by the frank and complacent, who derive a generous plea&s;ure from the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of bring|ing forth the merit of others to view, and of re|moving that veil which exce&s;&s;ive mode&s;ty throw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> over their good qualities. The&s;e two Ladies de|rived mutual plea&s;ure and advantage from each o|ther's &s;ociety; and before they parted, Lady Char|lotte entreated Loui&s;a to write to her, in &s;uch pre&s;|&s;ing terms, as left her no pretence for declining a corre&s;pondence, which &s;he by no means thought her&s;elf qualified to &s;upport.</P>
<P>One day, when the two young ladies and Lord Ha&s;tings were walking in the garden, Lady Char|lotte, with her u&s;ual vivacity, began to rally Mi&s;s Seymour on the number of conque&s;ts &s;he would make at Bath. The conver&s;ation happening to turn on the marriage of a young lady there to a rich, di&s;agreeable old mi&s;er, Loui&s;a expre&s;&s;ed her dete&s;|tation of a conduct &s;o intere&s;ted, in the &s;tronge&s;t
<PB N="83" REF="024442_0082_0FC73C338AEA9610">
terms. "Very well," replied her lively friend, <Q>all this is mighty pretty talking: Nay, I doubt not but you will carry your romantic folly &s;o far, as to marry &s;ome gentle generous youth, who be|lieves him&s;elf as capable of living on love, and hope, and vows, and non&s;en&s;e, as you do. But indeed, my dear girl, we mortals require &s;ome gro&s;&s;er aliment; and I'll venture to wager, you &s;hall be of my opinion before ten years are ex|pired: Nay, perhaps, as many weeks at Bath will be &s;ufficient to effect this marvellous change. Con|&s;ider, child, you have never yet &s;een the world. Oh! you know not the dear delight of being fol|lowed, admired, and flattered! Don't you think, my Lord, that Mi&s;s Seymour will &s;oon be of my opinion?&mdash;I &s;hould rather hope, madam, replied he gravely, that the empty adulation of mere admirers, would &s;erve to give Mi&s;s Seymour a ju&s;ter value for the e&s;teem and admiration of her real friends.</Q></P>
<P>Though Lady Charlotte paid little attention to this &s;peech, Loui&s;a perfectly comprehended the meaning of it. Indeed, the whole of this conver|&s;ation introduced into the minds of Lord Ha&s;tings and Mi&s;s Seymour a train of ideas &s;o unplea&s;ing, that they were glad to put an end to it, by return|ing to the Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>A few hours after the Marquis and his daughter went away, a genteel young woman demanded to &s;ee Mi&s;s Seymour alone, and was accordingly con|ducted to her apartment. It being then the du&s;k, Loui&s;a could not &s;ee the face of the per&s;on who waited for her; and was not a little alarmed on &s;eeing her bolt the door, and then, falling on her

knees, bur&s;t into a flood of tears, accompanied with &s;uch violent agitation, as for a while robbed her of the power of utterance. Loui&s;a begged to know what &s;he wanted. "Oh, Mi&s;s Seymour," cried &s;he, with a feeble voice, interrupted with &s;ighs, have you forgotten your once virtuous, once hap|py Sally Vernon? "Good Heavens! Sally," ex|claimed Loui&s;a, <Q>is it you? But how came you here at this late hour?&mdash;Why have you left Cam|bridge?&mdash;What is the cau&s;e of your di&s;tre&s;s?&mdash;"O!" continued the afflicted mourner, why did you &s;end me from you?

Had I &s;till been at Springwood, I would have been the happie&s;t, as I am now the mo&s;t mi&s;era|ble, of the human race.&mdash;</Q> She then proceeded, with much difficulty, to give Mi&s;s Seymour the melancholy relation contained in the following let|ter, which Loui&s;a di&s;patched to her friend early next morning, before &s;etting out for Bath;</P>

There &s;he has continued for &s;everal years pa&s;t, and behaved in a manner which gained her the affection of the whole family.</P>
<P>Some time ago, a young gentleman, of the name of Talbot, called to look at &s;ome ruffles: He &s;aw the unfortunate Sally, wrote &s;everal letters to her, pretending he was the &s;on of a wealthy farmer in the next county; and by various arts, prevailed on the un&s;u&s;pecting girl to corre&s;pond with him, and li&s;ten to his addre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>I cannot pretend to give you all the particulars of this &s;hocking affair; I had them from her own lips, and &s;pared her the painful relation. Suffice it to &s;ay, that in return for the mo&s;t tender and confiding affection, he has betrayed her to ruin, and loaded her with &s;hame.</P>
<P>Oh, my dear Lady Charlotte! how my heart &s;wells with indignation again&s;t the perpetrator of this mo&s;t cruel, this premeditated villany!&mdash;What will become of this wretched orphan I know not. He &s;et off a few days ago for France, without &s;ay|ing farewel, or leaving one guinea for her &s;upport, notwith&s;tanding her pre&s;ent deplorable &s;ituation.&mdash;

How mean, how de&s;picable does vice render the human character!</P>
<P>She a&s;ked to &s;ee me alone ye&s;terday; and af|ter throwing her&s;elf at my feet, and ingenuou&s;ly ac|knowledging her fault, which indeed would admit of many palliations, &s;he conjured me, by the memo|ry of my revered parent, to &s;ave her from infamy and want.

<P>It immediately occurred to me, that your good old nur&s;e whom we vi&s;ited together, would be a proper per&s;on for &s;uch a charge, e&s;pecially as &s;he has no family, and her cottage &s;tands remote from any other.&mdash;If Sally's ill-fated infant &s;ees the light, I can ea&s;ily find a nur&s;e for it in this neighbour|hood.&mdash;Let me know if this plan meets with your approbation.</P>

<P>I now addre&s;s my beloved friend, from the very centre of fa&s;hion and folly. Is this then the world, &s;o much de&s;ired, &s;o eagerly pur&s;ued, at the expence of health, peace&mdash;nay, even virtue it&s;elf?&mdash;Ah, my Adelaide! it has no charms for me; it never will have.</P>
<P>I am alarmed and di&s;concerted at every &s;tep: I am di&s;gu&s;ted with the extravagant levity of the women, and the ful&s;ome adulation of the men; who, in prai&s;ing others, &s;eem to be wholly engro&s;&s;ed by the care of di&s;playing their own talents, and plac|ing their &s;uperficial accompli&s;hments in the mo&s;t advantageous light.&mdash;That indi&s;criminating polite|ne&s;s, which the courte&s;y of the world dignifies with the title of good-breeding, appears to me to be nothing better than a refined &s;pecies of hypocri&s;y. I &s;hrink from the view of tho&s;e har&s;h and unamiable quali|ties, which the generality of our &s;pecies are neither at pains to correct nor conceal; and &s;eek in vain for the beloved circle of friends, with whom I am accu&s;tomed to conver&s;e with freedom and delight, in the quiet of the country. My heart is ever ready to &s;peak, but there are none to hear or an|&s;wer it: All here &s;eem to have but one care, one object, one idol&mdash;and that is &s;elf&mdash;to whom they pay uncea&s;ing homage.</P>
<P>How thankful to Providence ought we to be, my Adelaide, who hath pre&s;erved our hearts from

being corrupted by the world!&mdash;who hath endowed them with feelings too exalted, too refined, to be comprehended by tho&s;e who are en&s;laved by fa&s;hion, and who&s;e ta&s;te is depraved by vice and luxury!&mdash;How thankful, that the view of the &s;ublime, the u&s;eful, and the beautiful, both in the natural and moral world, excites in our &s;ouls the mo&s;t pure plea&s;ure, the mo&s;t devout gratitude, the mo&s;t lively adoration and prai&s;e!&mdash;The&s;e are emotions at once exqui&s;ite and ennobling!

<P>Your friend&s;hip for me, Adelaide, gives me a jealou&s;y of my&s;elf, to which I was formerly a &s;trang|er. She who hopes to maintain a place in that heart, where &s;uch noble candour, genero&s;ity, and friend&s;hip inhabit, ought to po&s;&s;e&s;s no vulgar &s;hare of the&s;e virtues. I fear to be unju&s;t to a friend&s;hip like your's, by admitting another candidate for mine; yet, after all, my Adelaide, I feet, that though I may e&s;teem and admire others for various good qualities, you, and you alone, are the friend of my heart.</P>
<P>About a week before we &s;et out for Bath, the Marquis of Winche&s;ter, who has a fine &s;eat in this neighbourhood, came with his daughter, to &s;pend

&s;ome days with Lord and Lady Granville.&mdash;I have never &s;een more dignity and grace united, than in Lady Charlotte Villiers: She is extremely hand|&s;ome, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a ready wit, which, as it is never di&s;played either to attract admiration, or give unne|ce&s;&s;ary pain, has the effect of rendering her con|ver&s;ation in the highe&s;t degree entertaining. She di&s;tingui&s;hes me by her notice; and, when we parted, &s;olicited my friend&s;hip and corre&s;pondence, in a manner truly plea&s;ing, and which did me much honour. But &s;hall I confe&s;s to my Adelaide, I feel more admiration than complacency for Lady Char|lotte? I cannot &s;hake off the re&s;traint which differ|ence of rank impo&s;es; and, through the noblene&s;s of her &s;entiments, I can yet perceive that &s;he values her&s;elf on the &s;uperiority of her birth. Be&s;ides, though highly accompli&s;hed, and extremely agree|able, Lady Charlotte wants that irre&s;i&s;tible charm which &s;en&s;ibility adds to the female character. She &s;ometimes amu&s;es her&s;elf with laughing at the guilt|le&s;s weakne&s;&s;es of her &s;pecies, but never expo&s;es them to public view. She de&s;pi&s;es popularity, and te&s;tifies her friend&s;hip, by placing your foibles in a light at once &s;o &s;triking and ridiculous, that, being neither able to excu&s;e nor deny, you have no way left but to abjure them.</P>
<P>"I often draw a compari&s;on between my beloved friend, and this admired beauty: Her perfections, like the meridian &s;un, dazzle and fatigue the &s;ight&mdash;Your's, my Adelaide, re&s;emble the &s;oft mild lu&s;|tre of the queen of Heaven, who&s;e charming a&s;pect we u&s;ed to contemplate together, with &s;uch ineffable delight, in the gardens of St. Cire.&mdash;Oh! with what plea&s;ing melancholy, what tender regret, do I re|call the hours &s;pent there!&mdash;Is there not, my be|loved

<P>Soon after the arrival of the Granville family at Bath, they went to vi&s;it the rooms. Whil&s;t they were walking there, a lady entered, leaning on a genteel young man, both in deep mourning; whom Loui&s;a in&s;tantly di&s;covered to be her travelling com|panions, Mrs. Stanhope, and her &s;on. They mu|tually expre&s;&s;ed their &s;atisfaction on occa&s;ion of this unexpected meeting; and Mr. Stanhope, with marks of the tendere&s;t &s;en&s;ibility, condoled with Loui&s;a on the lo&s;s &s;he had &s;u&s;tained, acquainting her at the &s;ame time with the death of his father, which had likewi&s;e happened &s;ince they parted at Dover.</P>
<P>As Mi&s;s Seymour looked very pale and dejected, he could not help expre&s;&s;ing great &s;olicitude about her health, the lo&s;s of which he feared had induced her to vi&s;it Bath at that unfa&s;hionable &s;ea&s;on. Lou|i&s;a, after proper acknowledgments, and informing him of the cau&s;e of her journey, turning to Lady Granville, "Permit me, Madam," &s;aid &s;he, <Q>to introduce Mrs. Stanhope and her &s;on to your ac|quaintance; their merit claims your e&s;teem, and my obligations to their kindne&s;s will &s;ecure them your friend&s;hip.</Q></P>
<P>Lord Ha&s;tings, from the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the room, had ob&s;erved with attention the plea&s;ing &s;ur|pri&s;e Loui&s;a expre&s;&s;ed on &s;eeing Mr. Stanhope.
<PB N="94" REF="024442_0093_0FC73C59E1449A00">
He came up to them at the moment &s;he uttered the la&s;t &s;entence, and was lo&s;t in amazement at her &s;peech, the import of which he could not po&s;&s;ibly comprehend, as he had not heard the name of Stan|hope, and knew of no friends whith whom Mi&s;s Seymour could be on &s;o familiar a footing.</P>
<P>He &s;oon ob&s;erved the con&s;tant and pointed atten|tion paid her by Mr. Stanhope, which &s;he received with the &s;weete&s;t complacency; and jealou&s;y was now added to the other re&s;tle&s;s pa&s;&s;ions that di&s;|tracted his &s;oul. But, though divided by turns between fear, &s;u&s;pen&s;e, and jealou&s;y, love maintain|ed its empire there. Loui&s;a appeared with &s;uperi|or advantages in every new point of light. Mode&s;|ty, humility, and ingenuity, were the con&s;tant in|mates of her gentle bo&s;om; and &s;he appeared with the &s;ame uncon&s;cious &s;weetne&s;s, and dignified com|po&s;ure, in public crouds of the gay and the di&s;&s;ipa|ted, as when &s;eated in the private circle of her cho|&s;en friends.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they returned home, Lord Ha&s;tings enquired eagerly after the name and quality of the &s;trangers. Loui&s;a readily informed him; and at the &s;ame time mentioned the kindne&s;s &s;hewn by them to her mother, in terms of &s;uch lively gra|titude, as excited his envy, and confirmed his &s;u&s;|picions.</P>
<P>Loui&s;a ob&s;erved, with extreme pain, the unea&s;i|ne&s;s of his mind, and depre&s;&s;ion of his &s;pirits.&mdash;The diffidence of his manner, whenever he addre&s;|&s;ed her, and the re&s;pectful attention with which he treated her, convinced her, that &s;he had injured him by her former &s;u&s;picions. No &s;ooner did her judg|ment

make this conce&s;&s;ion, than her heart eagerly &s;eized it, to ju&s;tify a thou&s;and little kindne&s;&s;es, which &s;he thought were due to a pa&s;&s;ion &s;o tender and di&s;intere&s;ted as that of Lord Ha&s;tings.</P>

<P>There is a tender plea&s;ure, my Loui&s;a, in re|flecting, that, perhaps at the &s;ame in&s;tant, though divided by many hundred miles, the &s;ame glowing affection is animating our hearts, the &s;ame plea&s;ing ta&s;k employing our hands.</P>
<P>Believe me, it is with real &s;atisfaction I hear of your forming new intimacies: Do not be afraid, my amiable, my ingenuous friend, to admit Lady Charlotte to a &s;hare of your affection: I am confi|dent I &s;hall not be a lo&s;er on that account. You cannot be unju&s;t; and the unequalled fondne&s;s I bear you, is my &s;ecurity for the &s;trength and con|&s;tancy of your attachment.&mdash;Long accu&s;tomed to the &s;tudy of tho&s;e valuable characters who compo&s;e our favourite circle, and who are all the world to us, we come at length to believe, that within this circle is compri&s;ed all that is valuable in the world. Friend&s;hip annihilates their foibles and magnifies their virtues: Others lo&s;e greatly by compari&s;on; and hence the &s;ocial and benevolent affections come at length to be confined to a &s;phere far too narrow and limited for their healthful exerci&s;e. Intimacy with a viriety of characters gives the mind more enlarged ideas, and a more liberal turn; and by di&s;|covering various great and good qualities in indi|viduals, we are induced to give credit to our &s;pecies for many more which we want opportunity to de|velop.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="024442_0095_0FC73C5EF44D4070">
Let me warn my beloved friend again&s;t cheri&s;h|ing that fal&s;e delicacy and exce&s;&s;ive refinement which would wholly unfit her for commerce with the world, and that &s;tation which Providence hath a&s;&s;igned her there. Philanthropy, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, conforms the human to the divine nature: Though there are har&s;h features in &s;ome characters, there are good qualities in all; and though the vices of individuals excite a virtuous indignation for our &s;pecies, as a collective body, let us ever cheri&s;h the &s;weet glow of benevolence.</P>
<P>Though &s;en&s;ibility adds grace to virtue, if it becomes &s;o exqui&s;ite as to occa&s;ion more pain and di&s;gu&s;t than plea&s;ure to its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, it can no longer be regarded as a ble&s;&s;ing. Approbation is a plea&s;ant &s;entiment; but it is a real misfortune to have ac|quired that degree of refinement, which gives us a di&s;reli&s;h for the ordinary pur&s;uits and &s;atisfactions of life.&mdash;When we enter the great theatre of the world, we find two repre&s;entations of human life: One, the work of imagination, a young giddy enthu&s;ia&s;t,&mdash;the other, that of experience, a &s;ober &s;kilful arti&s;t.

<P>I know there are &s;ome who arrogate to them|&s;elves the title of Philo&s;ophers, but who in fact are no lovers of wi&s;dom, but mere lovers of paradox, that derive all our actions from the &s;elfi&s;h principle. Let us detect the fallacy. No man could rightly

<P>Again, you affirm, that your charity was not di&s;intere&s;ted, becau&s;e you hoped by it to obtain my approbation. Our actions, my dear Mi&s;s Seymour, are &s;eldom the re&s;ult of a &s;ingle principle, but flow from a complex variety of motives. To wi&s;h for the approbation of the good, is at lea&s;t innocent, and cannot therefore contaminate the action to which it gives ri&s;e. And, although your charity may have looked to this as a part of its reward, yet a deed which in part was prompted by compa&s;&s;ion, is not therefore to be &s;tripped quite naked of merit. Let us guard again&s;t pride, by an impartial exami|nation of the hidden &s;prings of our conduct; but let us &s;hun al&s;o too &s;evere a &s;crutiny, le&s;t deprived of the &s;upport of &s;elf-approbation, the vigour of our minds fail, for want of that reviving cordial which our benignant Creator hath provided as an encou|ragement to per&s;everance in virtue.</P>

<P>You rally me, my dear Lady Charlotte, on my &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and love of retirement, which you term unnatural at my age. Truth is, though we may live in the world without adopting its prejudices, or being corrupted by its vices, we can hardly avoid being conformed to its cu&s;toms and manners, which are utterly repugnant both to my principles and ta&s;te.</P>
<P>The ab&s;urdity of the&s;e will not &s;trike your mind, becau&s;e they have long been familiar to you;
<PB N="100" REF="024442_0099_0FC7388AB72F49F0">
but permit me to a&s;k, what can be more unnatural, ridiculous, di&s;ingenuous, and even criminal, than the whole life and conduct of a fine Lady!&mdash;Let me attempt the picture: At the expence of health and duty, &s;he wa&s;tes in &s;leep or &s;loth tho&s;e &s;till, &s;e|rene, delightful hours, which ought to be devoted to the improvement of her mind and regulation of her family. She gets up with unea&s;y reflections on the lo&s;&s;es, di&s;appointments, and mortifications of the preceding day; or el&s;e with no reflections at all. Her temper is fretted during the tedious du|ties of the toilette, by di&s;covering in her face the &s;ure, though &s;ilent, ravages of time and di&s;&s;ipation. Chagrined with her&s;elf, &s;he vents her ill-humour indi&s;criminately on all who approach her; and her caprice and inju&s;tice teach even her children and dome&s;tics to de&s;pi&s;e her. Utterly ignorant of hap|pine&s;s, &s;he wa&s;tes the precious hours of life in vain|ly contriving the means of rendering them happy. To di&s;&s;ipate that time, which &s;he knows not to en|joy, yet who&s;e &s;ilent lap&s;e &s;he marks with terror, and deplores with angui&s;h, &s;he &s;ets out on a round of vi&s;its, in full confidence of being denied admit|tance by all who call them&s;elves her friends, and whom &s;he would indeed rank as enemies, did they con&s;ent to &s;ee her. But if, by &s;ome unfortunate mi&s;take, their doors are opened to receive her, &s;he execrates the fault; and with con&s;ummate art, and heroic di&s;&s;imulation, in&s;tantly converts her frowns into &s;miles, and flies with open arms to meet the very per&s;on, whom in her heart &s;he hates, de&s;pi&s;es, envies, and defames.&mdash;Company joins her at her &s;uperb, but joyle&s;s and inho&s;pitable meal. There, want of confidence and e&s;teem throws re&s;traint and coldne&s;s into conver&s;ation; for where there is no mutual de&s;ire to plea&s;e and be plea&s;ed, di&s;gu&s;t and

Frivolous conver&s;ation, unmeanning gallantry, in|&s;ipid plea&s;ures, and ruinous gaming, &s;um up the joys of a fine lady.&mdash;She may, indeed, be &s;aid to walk in a vain &s;how; for her life is a train of un|&s;ucce&s;sful deceit, which cannot impo&s;e upon the world, and which neither promotes her intere&s;t nor comfort. Her rankling pa&s;&s;ions increa&s;e with her years; her heart is the receptacle of pride, envy, malevolence, and di&s;gu&s;t:&mdash;Her youth is wa&s;ted in folly, her age has no friends: She lives without en|joyment, &s;he dies without hope!</P>
<P>Perhaps, my dear Lady Charlotte, you think me too &s;evere. Believe me, it was Truth that guid|ed the pencil, and Experience that fini&s;hed the piece. The glowing colours of imagination had no place there.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s I am &s;hocked and di&s;gu&s;ted beyond expre&s;&s;ion with the levity, and even rudene&s;s, of tho&s;e, who call them&s;elves the polite world. Would you believe it, I have been frequently ridiculed here, for my pre&s;ent mourning habit? The only out|ward te&s;timony I can give, of that reverence I &s;hall ever feel, for the memory of the be&s;t of mothers!</P>
<P>Two young ladies of fa&s;hion &s;tood near me la&s;t night; when, after di&s;concerting me extreme|ly, by &s;canning me from head to foot, with looks of ineffable contempt, This deep mourning for a mother, &s;aid one of them, who has already been dead two months, is ab&s;urd affectation.&mdash;Ah,

my dear, replied the other, this mu&s;hroom beauty, whom nobody knows, is not &s;o ignorant as not to perceive the effect black has, in heighten|ing the delicacy of &s;uch a &s;kin and complexion.</P>
<P>I am not con&s;cious of being vain or conceited, Lady Charlotte; but if I am, this is not the proper way of correcting me.&mdash;I will not allow my&s;elf, however, to feel la&s;ting re&s;entment, where, perhaps, no in&s;ult was intended. The&s;e young ladies were not con&s;cious of the pain they were inflicting, and, be&s;ides&mdash;they had not lo&s;t a mother!&mdash;With re&s;|pect to changing my dre&s;s, I &s;hall not regulate my conduct by their opinion. I can never regard the practice of wearing mourning &s;olely in the light of compliance with cu&s;tom: It &s;eems intended as a &s;ecurity again&s;t tho&s;e wounds, which a heart, yet &s;ore from recent di&s;tre&s;s, would feel, from witne&s;&s;|ing the extravagance of mirth, or thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s of levity.&mdash;Intemperate mu&s;t that mind be, which the pre&s;ence of a per&s;on, who&s;e countenance and habit expre&s;s the real mourner, will not awe for a little into &s;omething like &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s.&mdash;Another cu&s;tom, too, prevails in the world, which I think both cruel and unnece&s;&s;ary&mdash;That of admitting into the pre|&s;ence of one in deep affliction, all tho&s;e who, under the pretence of &s;ympathy, &s;eek only to gratify an impertinent and mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;ting curio&s;ity.

<P>You tell me, my amiable friend, that my let|ters at once amu&s;e and delight you: I can ea&s;ily believe that a heart &s;o tender, will find &s;en&s;ible plea|&s;ure in &s;ympathi&s;ing in the feelings of mine;&mdash;but indeed, Loui&s;a, the quiet and uniform tenour of the conventual life, furni&s;hes but very few topics of amu&s;ement.&mdash;There is nothing, however, from which a contemplative mind may not derive in|&s;truction. Whether we confine our views to earth, or rai&s;e them to Heaven, we &s;hall find new cau&s;e to admire the wi&s;dom and extol the goodne&s;s of the Creator, God!</P>
<P>Like you, I am a pa&s;&s;ionate, admirer of the &s;imple beauties of nature. Artle&s;s expre&s;&s;ions are ever the mo&s;t pethetic; and therefore tho&s;e objects which owe their charms to nature alone, are mo&s;t in harmony with my pre&s;ent feelings.&mdash;But whil&s;t we, my friend, felicitate our&s;elves on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a ta&s;te which can derive plea&s;ure from &s;o many &s;our|ces, ought we not to adore that Being, who, atten|tive not only to the nece&s;&s;ities, but enjoyment of his creatures, hath adju&s;ted the&s;e to their various capacities of happine&s;s?</P>

The &s;cenes, my Loui&s;a, which contribute to my in&s;truction, as well as plea&s;ure, are tho&s;e to which I mo&s;t frequently re&s;ort. The weak &s;tate of my health making change of air nece&s;&s;ary, my mother, with permi&s;&s;ion of the Abbe&s;s, has brought me once more to the &s;cenes of my earlie&s;t, happie&s;t years. With what mournful plea&s;ure, what tender regret, do I look back on tho&s;e years?&mdash;Happy! healthful! and innocent!&mdash;Ah! my friend, how ignorant are we then of the value of the&s;e ble&s;|&s;ings? It is not till the &s;treams of pro&s;perity are dried up, that we are &s;en&s;ible how plenteou&s;ly they have flowed: Mine, Loui&s;a, are cut off for ever!</P>
<P>Nothing pre&s;ents a more &s;triking emblem of Time, than a &s;ilent and &s;mooth-flowing river; &s;uch as that I have ju&s;t been contemplating.

<P>But a few months are pa&s;&s;ed, &s;ince we traced together the cour&s;e of this river: Its waters were then pure and tran&s;parent;&mdash;we admired its beauty, and were refre&s;hed with its coolne&s;s. How is the &s;cene changed? Swollen by a torrent of de&s;cending rains, it hath bur&s;t its bounds; and, dark, troubled, impetuous, it rolls along, involving, in its wa&s;teful progre&s;s, every herb and flower which it formerly nouri&s;hed!&mdash;So fares it with the human &s;oul&mdash;There, whil&s;t the affections flow in their &s;mooth and natural cour&s;e, the &s;eeds of virtue &s;pring, and its flowers blo&s;&s;om.

of pa&s;&s;ion ari&s;e, than every noble thought, and ge|nerous wi&s;h, and u&s;eful aim, are violently &s;wept away into the gulph of oblivion!</P>
<P>Be it our care, my Loui&s;a, to pre&s;erve the &s;tream of our affections pure from every &s;tain; and to cheri&s;h tho&s;e virtues which Heaven hath com|mitted to our care, till they &s;hall grow up to beauty and perfection, and be tran&s;planted to a milder clime, where they &s;hall imbibe the rays of a never|&s;etting &s;un, and flouri&s;h, with increa&s;ing &s;trength, beauty and vigour, for ever!</P>

Mu|&s;ic, dancing, cards, are occa&s;ionally called in; and even tho&s;e amu&s;ements for which &s;he has no reli&s;h her&s;elf, &s;he cheerfully adopts, in the hope of contri|buting to the enjoyment of others.&mdash;Public diver&s;i|ons are &s;ometimes vi&s;ited, but always tend with the rea&s;onable woman to increa&s;e her love of &s;ocial and dome&s;tic plea&s;ures.&mdash;When in public, &s;he appears with propriety and mode&s;ty.

<P>After all, my dear Lady Charlotte, is it not a&s;toni&s;hing that we are at &s;o little pains to become rea&s;onable women? We who&s;e limited and dome|&s;tic &s;ituation renders the cultivation of the le&s;&s;er mo|rals, the mild and gentle virtues, e&s;&s;ential to our comfort. There are few people who are not capa|ble of great and generous actions, when they know by them they will excite admiration and obtain applau&s;e; but in private life, where our virtues pa&s;s unheeded, we are at little pains to become di&s;intere&s;ted, benevolent, or &s;elf-denied. It is in pri|vate life, however, that opportunities are con&s;tantly occurring for the exerci&s;e of the&s;e virtues, and where we can at once witne&s;s and profit by their effects: But mankind, in general, prefer the un|meaning voice of the multitude to the &s;oothing ap|probation of their own minds.</P>

My mother is very de&s;irous, Mi&s;s Seymour, &s;aid he, of having my picture; but there is only one condition that will prevail on me to &s;ubmit to this tire&s;ome operation.

<P>Lady Granville was not aware of the con&s;equence of her reque&s;t, el&s;e her prudence would have pre|vented
<PB N="112" REF="024442_0111_0FC738B4C1949A20">
her from making it. Several circum&s;tances combined to per&s;uade her, that Lord Ha&s;tings took a more lively intere&s;t in her young favourite, than &s;he thought con&s;i&s;tent, either with his pre&s;ent ea&s;e or future pro&s;pects. She could not avoid, however, &s;econding her &s;on's propo&s;al, and added, with equal prudence and politene&s;s, I &s;hall envy nobody when I &s;hall have two &s;uch plea&s;ant friends in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.&mdash;Lord Ha&s;tings urged his re|que&s;t with a warmth and importunity that exceed|ingly di&s;concerted Loui&s;a. Ever fearful of betray|ing her &s;ecret &s;entiments, though &s;he knew not how to refu&s;e, &s;he greatly dreaded complying; but in this in&s;tance her prudence was overborne, by her &s;trong inclination to oblige him. Though Lord Ha&s;tings remarked her he&s;itation and embarra&s;&s;ment, without knowing the cau&s;e, he was &s;en&s;ibly gratified by her obliging compliance.</P>
<P>The coach was immediately ordered, and they drove to the lodging of Mr. Valoi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">; who being then di&s;engaged, begged leave to take the outlines of the two pictures, as his time at Bath was very uncertain.</P>
<P>A little di&s;pute now aro&s;e between Mi&s;s Seymour and Lord Ha&s;tings, with re&s;pect to who &s;hould &s;it fir&s;t. Loui&s;a &s;aid, that as Mr. Valois's time was uncertain, it was undoubtedly proper, that the pic|ture of Lord Ha&s;tings &s;hould be fir&s;t fini&s;hed; but he, recurring to his mother's &s;peech, in&s;i&s;ted on her &s;etting the example. This little altercation gave an agreeable heightening to the delicate complexion of Loui&s;a. As &s;he was dre&s;&s;ed in a large morning cap, the painter found it nece&s;&s;ary to have it remov|ed, in order to obtain a full view of her cheek, as
<PB N="113" REF="024442_0112_0FC738B63A97A240">
&s;he was to be drawn in profile. This trifling cir|cum&s;tance exceedingly di&s;concerted the mode&s;t and gentle Loui&s;a, who&s;e elegant mind was exqui&s;itely &s;en&s;ible to every feeling of propriety. She looked aba&s;hed, her colour increa&s;ed; Lady Granville &s;aw her embarra&s;&s;ment; and in order to relieve it, "Come, my love," &s;aid &s;he, we will retire a a moment, and I will my&s;elf try to perform the office of fri&s;eur: Mr. Valois will excu&s;e me, tho' I &s;hould not prove very dexterous in my new profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>During their &s;hort ab&s;ence, the &s;cene in the park at Springwood occurred to the memory of Lord Ha&s;tings. He was &s;eized with the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate de&s;ire to have Loui&s;a drawn in the very attitude in which he had beheld her at the grave of her mother. Afraid of the penetrating eyes of his own, he had not courage to propo&s;e it; and not having a mo|ment to lo&s;e,&mdash;"As this Lady, Sir," &s;aid he, "is in the habit of a mourner, I &s;hould imagine the at|titude mo&s;t favourable for the character of her face would be that of devotion." The painter being perfectly of his opinion, he propo&s;ed on return of the ladies, that Mi&s;s Seymour &s;hould take a &s;eat near the window, and fix her eyes on the ceiling for a few minutes.</P>
<P>What were the agitating emotions which Lord Ha&s;tings experienced during their progre&s;s! An a&s;&s;ociation of ideas, altogether delightful, occupied, his mind, and his eyes were rivetted to a face, who&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|whole loveline&s;s he had never till that time had a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">" opportunity of ob&s;erving.&mdash;Her fine che&s;nut ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">er contra&s;ted with the whitene&s;s and delicacy of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">m|&s;kin,
<PB N="114" REF="024442_0113_0FC738BEB277CCC0">
and the glow of exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility, occa&s;ion|ed by the novelty of her &s;ituation, rendered her &s;o inimitably beautiful, that the arti&s;t, as well as the lover, was rapt in &s;ilent admiration.</P>
<P>She aro&s;e, and Lord Ha&s;tings unwillingly took her place.&mdash;Some difficulty now occurred about the attitude in which he &s;hould be drawn; the pain|ter having remarked the uncommon and animated expre&s;&s;ion of his fine eyes, reque&s;ted permi&s;&s;ion to take his full face.</P>
<P>No time could have been more favourable to do ju&s;tice both to the excellency of the &s;ubject and &s;kill of the arti&s;t. The countenance of Lord Ha&s;|tings was lighted up by a variety of the &s;weete&s;t and mo&s;t tender &s;en&s;ations; and the object on whom his eyes were chiefly fixed was not likely to di&s;&s;ipate them.</P>
<P>The pictures were fini&s;hed, and met with uni|ver&s;al approbation. But as they were confe&s;&s;edly the mo&s;t beautiful and highly fini&s;hed pieces in his collection, Mr. Valois begged permi&s;&s;ion to detain them a little while in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, as they did him much credit by being &s;hewn. One morning when Mrs. Stanhope called to take Mi&s;s Seymour out an airing, &s;he expre&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t curio&s;ity to &s;ee the pictures, on which, &s;he &s;aid, &s;he heard the highe&s;t encomiums lavi&s;hed wherever &s;he went. Accordingly they drove to the painter's, who ap|peared to be extremely hurried.&mdash;I have ju&s;t received accounts, Madam, &s;aid he, to Mi&s;s Sey|mour, of the death of a relation, which obliges <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> me to &s;et out this very night for London. I was
<PB N="115" REF="024442_0114_0FC738C000497898">
about to &s;end the pictures, but perhaps you will take the trouble of carrying them home your&s;elf. Loui&s;a took out her pur&s;e; but Mr. Valois prevent|ed her, by &s;aying they were already paid for. Then &s;tepping to the table, and taking out of the drawer a little &s;ealed packet, he &s;aid, in a low voice, May I beg, Madam, that you will have the goodne&s;s to pre&s;ent this to Lord Ha&s;tings, when nobody is pre&s;ent.&mdash;The a&s;toni&s;hed Loui&s;a he&s;itated a moment, not knowing what an&s;wer to make, but afraid of being ob&s;erved by her companion, &s;he put it ha&s;tily into her pocket. Her de&s;ire to know the contents of this little parcel was extreme, but it proceeded not from curio&s;ity alone; a &s;entiment a thou&s;and times more powerful, more irre&s;i&s;tible, excited it. She &s;huddered at the bare idea of doing a mean or di&s;honourable action; &s;he determined to conquer her pre&s;ent temptation to it; but an acci|dent in&s;tantly occurred, that left her no time for he&s;itating about what conduct &s;he ought to pur&s;ue. Having &s;et down Mrs. Stanhope at her own lodg|ings, &s;he proceeded in her coach to tho&s;e of Lord Granville; on &s;tepping out, the foot-board being much lower than that to which &s;he was accu&s;tom|ed, her foot &s;lipt, and &s;he fell to the ground with violence. The bu&s;tle this accident occa&s;ioned in the hall reached Lord Ha&s;tings, who, on hearing Loui|&s;a's voice, flew to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance. On &s;eeing her pale and trembling, "Good Heaven, Mi&s;s Seymour," cried he, eagerly, "what is the matter?" No|thing at all, my Lord, an&s;wered &s;he, &s;miling, but with a voice &s;till faultering with fear and agi|tation; "Indeed, I &s;hall be quite well pre&s;ently." He &s;upported her into the parlour, and &s;poke to her in a manner, and with a tone &s;o &s;oftened with com|pa&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="116" REF="024442_0115_0FC738C17AEB09D0">
that &s;he was tempted to regret &s;he had &s;o little excu&s;e for exciting it. As Lady Granville was abroad, he contrived, under pretence of giving her time to recover from the &s;hock &s;he had got by her fall, to detain her in the parlour for half an hour; during which, an intere&s;ting conver&s;ation took place; and he found opportunity of te&s;tifying to her tho&s;e watchful and quiet attentions that flow directly from the heart, and of which the heart knows the full value.</P>
<P>Though there never could have been a more fa|vourable opportunity than the pre&s;ent for comply|ing with the reque&s;t of the painter, Loui&s;a could not find courage to give Lord Ha&s;tings the packet her&s;elf; but delayed fixing on the proper means of conveying it to him till &s;he &s;hould reach her own apartment. As &s;oon as &s;he did &s;o, &s;he took it out of her pocket; and di&s;covered, with great emotion, that the &s;eal had been broken by her fall. Her cu|rio&s;ity now became irre&s;i&s;tible.&mdash;"Surely," whi&s;|pered &s;he to her&s;elf, there can be nothing in a parcel from Mr. Valois to Lord Ha&s;tings that I may not &s;ee!&mdash;In any other in&s;tance but this, Mi&s;s Seymour would have argued in a different manner. Too well do we know how rea&s;on will weigh and judgment determine, when inclination holds the balance.&mdash;She unfolded a paper, in which was a picture &s;ealed up, and an open billet contain|ing the&s;e words:</P>
<LETTER>
<P>I have &s;trictly ob&s;erved your Lord&s;hip's injunc|tions;&mdash;no eye but my own has &s;een this picture. I have folded the hands in the form of adoration, as you directed, and think the whole piece im|proved

</LETTER>
<P>Whil&s;t Loui&s;a peru&s;ed this billet, &s;he was &s;eized with &s;uch a fainti&s;h &s;ickne&s;s, and her hand trem|bled &s;o violently, that for &s;ome minutes &s;he was un|able to uncla&s;p the picture. At la&s;t &s;he did &s;o; and with a feeling of mingled delight and a&s;toni&s;h|ment, perceived that it was a copy of her own.</P>
<P>The pure and animated plea&s;ure with which this di&s;covery in&s;pired the gentle bo&s;om of Loui&s;a, is not to be de&s;cribed. She now indulged, without re&s;traint, the enchanting conviction, that &s;he was beloved; and the &s;oothing hope of being one day at liberty to avow to the de&s;erving object of her ten|derne&s;s, tho&s;e &s;entiments which at pre&s;ent &s;he &s;o carefully concealed. She grudged every moment till the picture &s;hould be in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Lord Ha&s;tings; yet knew not how to convey it to him, without incurring &s;u&s;picion of having her&s;elf been the bearer. Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s made her cowardly; and in her eagerne&s;s to contrive the means of execu|ting her purpo&s;e and avoiding &s;u&s;picion, &s;he over|looked the one lea&s;t liable to it.&mdash;At length it oc|curred to her thoughts.&mdash;"O!" whi&s;pered &s;he, as &s;he wrapt up the picture, <Q>may this lifele&s;s image

<P>Recollecting that there could be no danger of any ecclairci&s;&s;ement between Lord Ha&s;tings and Mr. Valois, &s;he inclo&s;ed the letter and picture in a blank cover; and ringing for her maid, de&s;ired her to give the parcel to Lord Ha&s;tings's &s;ervant, and to bid him acquaint his ma&s;ter, that it came from Mr. Valois, who was gone out of town.&mdash;The maid returned, and informed her, that &s;he had obeyed her orders; and at the &s;ame time pre&s;ented her with the following letter from Lady Charlotte, which, being in perfect uni&s;on with the pre&s;ent cheerful tone of her mind, tended not a little to heighten the charms of her animated countenance.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mi&s;s Seymour.</HEAD>
<P>How happy, Loui&s;a, &s;hould I be, if, in loving you, I dur&s;t believe I was loving my&s;elf! But you are an artful little &s;ophi&s;t; and by impo&s;ing this fallacy upon me, are &s;lily pilfering away the little remains of that heart, of which you had almo&s;t en|tirely robbed me.&mdash;</P>
<P>But why do I talk of love?&mdash;Envy and jea|lou&s;y now wholly po&s;&s;e&s;s me!&mdash;You not only &s;uc|ce&s;sfully intimate, you excel me at my own wea|pons! What mortal could bear to be thus out|&s;hone?&mdash;Not even your rea&s;onable woman, Loui&s;a;&mdash;how much le&s;s a fa&s;hionable one?</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="024442_0118_0FC738CCC3C80098">
I verily believe the word love will be expunged from the Engli&s;h vocabulary, and pride, vanity, and intere&s;t placed in its &s;tead. You know I hate to be pitied; but how can you withhold your pity, when you behold your poor friend, rivalled, at once in genius, love, fortune, and fame? I do not wi&s;h to kill you with &s;urpri&s;e; but whatever is the con&s;e|quence, I mu&s;t inform you, that Mi&s;s Nel&s;on, the young&mdash;the gay&mdash;the beautiful&mdash;the ALL FOR LOVE! is married to the old&mdash;the gouty&mdash;the peevi&s;h&mdash;the good-for-nothing Lord We&s;tdale. She has wedded wealth and grandeur:&mdash;May &s;he ta&s;te all the hap|pine&s;s they are calculated to be&s;tow!&mdash;Is not this wi&s;h, Loui&s;a, like a REASONABLE WOMAN?</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t tell you all in due order. I went to dine to-day at&mdash;A bu&s;tle on the &s;treet drew me to the window: I threw up the fa&s;h; but, Heavens! what was my a&s;toni&s;hment, my mortifi|cation, when I beheld my quondam lover, Lord We&s;tdale, &s;etting out with his bride, with all the charming apparatus of marriage &s;inery&mdash;carriages&mdash;liveries&mdash;favours! My heart died within me, and my pangs were increa&s;ed by the bitter reflection, that all this happine&s;s might have been my own. In the mid&s;t of my affliction, however, I have derived &s;ome con&s;olation from the prudent &s;ugge&s;tions of good aunt Gertrude. She is of opinion, that there is &s;till room for hope, &s;ince he has already buried three wives; and kindly adds, that if I am fortunate enough to be &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the pre&s;ent incumbent, I &s;hall pro|bably &s;ee him out, and remain mi&s;tre&s;s of the field.</P>
<P>I &s;hall be with you in a few days, that I may be able to judge of the effects of Bath. I doubt not it has produced a total revolution in your opi|nions,

and fitted you for living in that world where you are &s;o well qualified to &s;hine. May your re|formation become every day more complete; may I &s;ee you &s;pend the whole morning at your toilette, the whole evening at cards, the whole night in dancing, and the whole day in &s;leep.&mdash;Nay, not contented with &s;eeing you become exemplary in fa&s;hion, and eminent in folly, may I live to hear you tran&s;mitting your precepts and improvements to po&s;terity; and in&s;tructing your favourite grand|daughter in the manner following:</P>
<P>You a&s;k me, my dear child, the name and hi&s;|tory of that pretty boy with a bow and quiver, whom you &s;ee in the arras?&mdash;You mu&s;t know, that long, long ago, this rogui&s;h archer was a mighty favourite, e&s;pecially among the little mi&s;&s;es. But, in proce&s;s of time, their wi&s;e parents began to di&s;|cover, that he taught them a thou&s;and mi&s;chievous tricks, by means of the&s;e very arrows; which they u&s;ed to &s;teal from him, and &s;hoot at the poor harmle&s;s boys, who were minding not one earthly thing but their book and exerci&s;es. To &s;ay truth, I believe he had no ill intention; but being forbid the hou&s;e, whenever he ventured to revi&s;it his old companions, they were obliged to conceal him with the utmo&s;t care. Unluckily, &s;ome of them, who had been expre&s;sly ordered to di&s;mi&s;s him (and you know good children always do as they are bid) were di&s;covered harbouring him in a &s;ecret corner, where they thought no one could &s;ee him.&mdash;Upon which it was agreed by their papas and mammas, to bring a great tall fellow, called Intere&s;t, to chace him out of the world.&mdash;The poor boy, in terror for his life, fled with the utmo&s;t precipitation, till he was met by Poverty,

who took him along with her into her hovel: His innocent prattle u&s;ed to &s;weeten her toil, and he a&s;&s;i&s;ted her in her labour, in reward for the &s;helter &s;he afforded him. It is greatly doubted whether he &s;till exi&s;ts; and as he has not been &s;een in the world the&s;e many years, if he does live, it mu&s;t certainly be in &s;ome remote corner, with this poor ragged companion.&mdash;'Indeed, Grandmamma,' &s;ays Loui&s;a the third, with tears in her eyes, I am very &s;orrow for poor little Ma&s;ter Cupid; and if I knew where to find him, I would feed him with my own victuals, and carry him in my bo&s;om like my doll.&mdash;'No, no, my good child,' an&s;wers grandy, your doll is a much more harmle&s;s toy; be&s;ides, you'll &s;oon grow up, and become a fine lady, and get acquainted with Intere&s;t, who, to &s;ay truth, &s;ince he has been univer&s;ally received into genteel company, is grown a very hand&s;ome and agreeable fellow.</P>
<P>Now, my dear Loui&s;a, to complete the &s;um of my pious wi&s;hes, may both your in&s;tructions and example have their full effect in the world; and, for the good of others, I pray Heaven that your children, and grand-children, and late&s;t po&s;terity, may in all things exactly re&s;emble <HI>your&s;elf.</HI></P>

<P>On coming down to dinner, Mi&s;s Seymour found Mrs. Stanhope and her &s;on in the parlour, whom Lady Granville had met in her morning excur&s;ion. The moment Lord Ha&s;tings entered the room, he enquired after Loui&s;a's health, with marks of the
<PB N="122" REF="024442_0121_0FC738D8358EFBB8">
mo&s;t tender &s;olicitude.&mdash;"How," demanded Lady Granville, "has Mi&s;s Seymour been indi&s;po&s;ed?" "Indeed, Madam," replied Lord Ha&s;tings, "tho' Mi&s;s Seymour is always aver&s;e to give pain, I am confident &s;he mu&s;t have &s;uffered by the violence of her fall this morning." He then proceeded to give his mother an account of it; but was interrupted by Loui&s;a, who, &s;eeing Lady Granville look anxious and unea&s;y, ro&s;e, and taking hold of her hand, "I am quite a&s;hamed," &s;aid &s;he, "that Lord Ha&s;tings &s;hould make this &s;o &s;erious an affair: I a&s;&s;ure you, my dear Madam, I do not feel the &s;lighte&s;t unea&s;i|ne&s;s&mdash;I am perfectly well."&mdash;"I confe&s;s I am di&s;|po&s;ed to credit Mi&s;s Seymour, Madam," &s;aid Mrs. Stanhope, turning to Lady Granville, "for in &s;pite of his Lord&s;hip's apprehen&s;ions, I really think I ne|ver &s;aw her look &s;o well in my life." A con&s;cious blu&s;h over&s;pread the fine features of Loui&s;a, which tended not a little to render all the company of Mrs. Stanhope's opinion.</P>
<P>After dinner, the &s;ubject of the pictures was in|troduced, and occa&s;ioned, in the hearts both of Lord Ha&s;tings and Mi&s;s Seymour, a variety of the &s;weete&s;t emotions. The former could not re&s;i&s;t the plea&s;ure of talking on it: "I know no art," &s;aid he, "which furni&s;hes the mind with &s;o many plea|&s;ing ideas as painting."&mdash;"I &s;hould certainly ex|cept that of writing, my Lord," &s;aid Mr. Stanhope.&mdash;"Writing, indeed," replied his Lord&s;hip, "pre|&s;ents us with an image of the &s;oul, as painting does of the per&s;on of our friend: But the former is not always open for our in&s;pection; be&s;ides, a letter is liable to a thou&s;and accidents, and may never reach the per&s;on for whom it is de&s;igned;&mdash;a picture ac|companies us at all times, and in all places;&mdash;a let|ter

does not always accord with our &s;entiments&mdash;we can make a picture &s;peak the very language of our wi&s;hes."&mdash;"I have heard &s;o many encomiums be&s;towed on tho&s;e of Mi&s;s Seymour and your Lord|&s;hip," &s;aid Mr. Stanhope, "that I confe&s;s I am be|come very de&s;irous of &s;eeing them."&mdash;"You mu&s;t apply to me for that favour," &s;aid Lady Granville, "for I value them too highly ever to tru&s;t them out of my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion."&mdash;She gave him the pictures: On looking at Mi&s;s Seymour's, "Your Lady&s;hip &s;urely cannot be &s;o uncon&s;cionable," &s;aid he, "as to keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion both of this copy and the charm|ing original?"&mdash;"Indeed, Mr. Stanhope," &s;he re|plied, "I &s;hall find very great difficulty in parting with either; but as a time will probably arrive when I mu&s;t re&s;ign my right in Mi&s;s Seymour, I am re&s;olved at lea&s;t to retain her image in my po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion."&mdash;"That image, Madam," rejoined he, "is &s;o dear to her friends, that I am per&s;uaded you will not refu&s;e them a &s;hare in your plea&s;ure, by per|mitting them to have copies taken of this admirable picture.&mdash;You know Mi&s;s Seymour," continued he, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Loui&s;a, "it is long &s;ince you allowed my claim to the title of friend: I flatter my&s;elf you will not be &s;o unkind as to di&s;pute it on this occa&s;ion."&mdash;"Indeed, Sir," an&s;wered &s;he, with unaffected &s;weetne&s;s and mode&s;ty, "my friends and I think very differently, I believe, on this &s;ubject; and, to prevent any di&s;pute about the matter, I mu&s;t beg Lady Granville, from who&s;e partiality to the original the picture derives its chief merit, to take it again into her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion:" So &s;aying, &s;he return|ed the picture to Lady Granville, with a look and manner which convinced her, that &s;he wi&s;hed the &s;ubject to be dropped. Lady Granville accordingly put the pictures into her pocket.</P>

Lord Ha&s;tings felt all the plea&s;ure of a &s;ucce&s;sful rival on this occa&s;ion. To be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, even though by &s;tealth, of that picture which Mi&s;s Seymour had refu&s;ed to Mr. Stanhope, gave him a joy &s;o &s;incere, that it brightened his countenance, and enlivened his conver&s;ation during the whole evening.&mdash;Mr. Stanhope, on the contrary, appeared ab&s;ent, thought|ful, and unea&s;y. The coldne&s;s of Loui&s;a's manner to Lord Ha&s;tings, on their coming to Bath, had removed from his mind all fear of his being a fa|voured rival; but he could not help remarking the mutual complacency they now &s;hewed for each other, and his jealou&s;y and apprehen&s;ion gave weight to a thou&s;and circum&s;tances, which, to an uncon|cerned &s;pectator, would have appeared as nothing. He had long &s;ought in vain for an opportunity of &s;peaking to Mi&s;s Seymour alone; and hearing that the day was fixed for her leaving Bath, he re&s;olved to be relieved from the torment of &s;u&s;pen&s;e, and to convey to her, by means of a letter, tho&s;e &s;entiments which he found it impo&s;&s;ible any longer to conceal.</P>
<P>Afraid of this letter being delivered to her before company, he contrived to convey it to her him&s;elf, when coming out of the rooms; yet not &s;o private|ly as not to be ob&s;erved by Lord Ha&s;tings, who&s;e watchful eyes were continually fixed on Loui&s;a, and who in&s;tantly perceived the agitation produced in her mind by this circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Seymour had indeed begun to &s;u&s;pect, that Mr. Stanhope's &s;entiments for her were of a nature &s;till more tender than friend&s;hip; and was &s;o &s;in|cerely his friend, that &s;he was greatly afflicted a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the thought of giving him pain.

with him, to &s;hew him the improbability of &s;ucceeding in his &s;uit; to prevent his urging it, and, if po&s;&s;ible, to &s;ave him the mortification of a refu&s;al.</P>
<P>This generous conduct, however, had not the de&s;ired effect. The following letter at once con|firmed her &s;u&s;picions, and &s;hewed her the ineffica|cy of her mea&s;ures:</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>With judgment and penetration like your's, I cannot &s;uppo&s;e that you are ignorant of the &s;enti|ments which have long taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my heart: With &s;uch con&s;tant opportunities of di&s;covering the excellence of your's, how could I remain in&s;en&s;ible to your merit?&mdash;Con&s;cious, however, of the pre|&s;umption of cheri&s;hing tho&s;e hopes it in&s;pired, I have long &s;truggled to conceal a pa&s;&s;ion, which was painful to me, only becau&s;e I feared it would be di&s;|plea&s;ing to you. A certain coldne&s;s and re&s;traint, but too vi&s;ible of late in your manner, leaves me no room to doubt either of your knowledge or di&s;ap|probation of the mo&s;t re&s;pectful, &s;incere, and con|&s;tant, though, I fear, unfortunate attachment.</P>
<P>Think not, dear Mi&s;s Seymour, that hope has dictated this confe&s;&s;ion&mdash;Ah! no; it is fear&mdash;it is apprehen&s;ion alone, which has forced it from me: It is the dread of lo&s;ing your e&s;teem, which is im|pelling me to a mea&s;ure that may, perhaps, for ever forfeit it. I hardly know what I write&mdash;Oh! Mi&s;s Seymour, pity the di&s;traction of my mind; &s;ay, you forgive my pre&s;umption: If po&s;&s;ible, allow me
<PB N="126" REF="024442_0125_0FC738E48A31D918">
to hope, from time, a&s;&s;iduity, and, above all, the exalted genero&s;ity of your heart, that it will one day reply to the &s;entiments of mine. If you can|not do this, teach me to abandon the only hope which could make life de&s;irable!&mdash;Ah! Mi&s;s Sey|mour, rather teach me to forget it, in the enjoy|ment of that peace, which I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed before I ra&s;h|ly a&s;pired to a dearer name than that of friend!&mdash;Alas! I fear, you never can re&s;tore my lo&s;t tran|quillity; yet do not, I be&s;eech you, by your chil|ling indifference, add the bitterne&s;s of felt contempt to the angui&s;h of di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>I will not offend you with my complaints&mdash;on|ly do not bani&s;h me from your &s;ight&mdash;do not de|prive me of my only con&s;olation, that of ju&s;tifying to my&s;elf the indulgence of a pa&s;&s;ion I cannot conquer, by daily beholding new proofs of tho&s;e virtues which fir&s;t in&s;pired it.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Loui&s;a's di&s;tre&s;s, on peru&s;ing this letter, was ex|treme; nor was it le&s;&s;ened on being told next mor|ning, by Lady Granville, that &s;he had ju&s;t been to wait on Mrs. Stanhope, to reque&s;t &s;he and her &s;on would accompany them to Ca&s;tle-Ha&s;tings, and &s;pend a few weeks there.&mdash;She was perplexed be|yond mea&s;ure, with re&s;pect to the conduct &s;he ought to hold; and, with a degree of inju&s;tice, of which love often makes us guilty, felt re&s;entment again&s;t Mr. Stanhope, on account of the unea&s;ine&s;s &s;he then &s;uffered, from a pa&s;&s;ion which too well &s;he knew to excu&s;e in her&s;elf; and which merited compa&s;&s;ion in proportion to its hopele&s;&s;ne&s;s; and actually di&s;liked him, on account of that preference, for which her rea&s;on told her, both e&s;teem and gra|titude were due.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="024442_0126_0FC738E578E012E8">
Though no occa&s;ion of &s;peaking to Mi&s;s Sey|mour in private, occurred before leaving Bath, it was ea&s;y for Mr. Stanhope to di&s;cover how unwel|come the contents of his letter had been to her: But though, from her &s;tudiou&s;ne&s;s to avoid him, he was convinced of her indifference, and even apprehen&s;ive of her di&s;like, he could not re&s;i&s;t the de&s;ire he felt to accompany her; the plea&s;ure of beholding her, and the hope with which he flattered him&s;elf that the ardour and con&s;tancy of his attachment would at length make a favourable impre&s;&s;ion, on a mind &s;o generous, and a heart &s;o &s;u&s;ceptible, as that of Mi&s;s Seymour.</P>
<P>Accordingly, the too families &s;et off for the Ca|&s;tle; and, after making &s;everal agreeable excur&s;ions in their way, arrived there in &s;afety.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t employment in which Loui&s;a engaged, was that of writing to Adelaide; accu&s;tomed to &s;hare with her every thought of her &s;oul, &s;he felt as if guilty of trea&s;onable concealment, till &s;he &s;hould di&s;cover to that faithful friend, the various &s;enti|ments with which her's was agitated.</P>

<P>IT is with inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;atisfaction I learn, that the friend of my &s;oul has in &s;ome mea&s;ure regained the tranquillity of her's. This, more than any other circum&s;tance, will contribute to the reco|very of your health. Oh! may Heaven perfect it, and &s;pare you for the friend, the guide, the com|fortre&s;s of your Loui&s;a!</P>
<P>Tru&s;t me, Adelaide, I almo&s;t envy you the re|po&s;e you &s;o feelingly de&s;cribe, and which, I fear, I have lo&s;t for ever! I cannot be &s;o unju&s;t to your tender and generous friend&s;hip, as to hide from you the anxieties that prey upon my heart.&mdash;Ha&s;t|ings, the &s;on of my benefactre&s;s&mdash;the noble, gene|rous, accompli&s;hed Ha&s;tings, has, I fear, made too deep an impre&s;&s;ion there!</P>
<P>I will not conceal from you, that I believe I am beloved; but &s;mall is the con&s;olation that thought &s;hould afford me! Birth, fortune, every thing for|bids my a&s;piring wi&s;hes;&mdash;gratitude alone ought for ever to repre&s;s them. But my Adelaide will pity me; &s;he knows that all the&s;e ob&s;tacles &s;eem nothing to love.</P>

In the mid&s;t of a thou&s;and tormenting inquie|tudes, your friend&s;hip is a never-failing &s;ource of plea&s;ure and con&s;olation. When fatigued with company, or &s;ick of my own reflections, I retire to a &s;weet apartment in the garden, which is elegant|ly fitted up, and adorned with one ornament more valuable than all the re&s;t&mdash;it is your picture, Ade|laide, with which a thou&s;and, thou&s;and tender ideas are connected: This little idol hallows the place in my imagination, and I regard it as the temple of friend&s;hip&mdash;I look up to it with a mournful attention&mdash;I gaze on it till it almo&s;t &s;eems animated&mdash;I try to make it &s;peak the language of my wi&s;hes, and your heart!

<HEAD>To Mi&s;s Seymour.</HEAD>
<P>Help me to rail, Loui&s;a! I am out of all pati|ence.&mdash;This morning I got up earlier than u&s;ual; I di&s;patched all my dome&s;tications; and ordered the coach the moment breakfa&s;t was over, that I might fly to my beloved friend, and &s;pend the whole day with her. Armed at all points,&mdash;ready alike for flirting with Ha&s;tings, philo&s;ophi&s;ing with his father, or morali&s;ing with you, I was ju&s;t in the very act of &s;tepping into the coach, when that of Mr. Alderman Sagely, and a whole &s;quad of his city
<PB N="5" REF="024442_0130_0FC735BDC51302E0">
&s;ons and daughters, arrived, not for a flying vi&s;it of a how-do-ye, as they in&s;tantly told me, but for a "kind neighbourly vi&s;it of a week."&mdash;In&s;upportable! Had you &s;een my countenance at that moment, Loui&s;a, it would have given the lie to my education, which, though confe&s;&s;edly that of a fa&s;hionable woman, has not taught me to become a di&s;ingenuous one. Principle, however, got the better for once of feel|ing. It is &s;urely immoral, Loui&s;a, to make a fel|low-creature &s;uffer any &s;pecies of unea&s;ine&s;s that you can prevent.</P>
<P>I ought to do ju&s;tice to my own patience and meekne&s;s, by attempting a de&s;cription of this city inva&s;ion,&mdash;but the thing is impo&s;&s;ible!&mdash;I really do not think there ever was collected together in one family &s;uch a mi&s;cellaneous &s;et of di&s;agreeables. I &s;hall find as much difficulty to arrange them on pa|per, as in my drawing-room.</P>
<P>The Alderman, though fir&s;t in cour&s;e, yet la&s;t in command, having no character at all, we &s;hall &s;et a&s;ide. His wife a&s;pires to that of a fine lady, which &s;he mi&s;takes for that of an invalid; and talks of no|thing but &s;pleen, nerves, vapours, green tea, and a&s;&s;a-foetida.&mdash;His daughters a&s;pire to be wits, and become maimed regi&s;ters of low wittici&s;ms, dull je&s;ts, &s;tale puns, and murdered &s;en&s;e. His &s;on a&s;|pires with better rea&s;on to be a jockey; and de&s;cants, for aught I know, very learnedly, on the betts at Newmarket, the victories of the turf, and the me|rits of a che&s;nut filly, whom he would not exchange for the Trojan hor&s;e of heroic memory, nay, nor for Pega&s;us him&s;elf. But however ill-founded the preten&s;ions of &s;ome of the family, in one thing they
<PB N="6" REF="024442_0131_0FC735BF4199A330">
all &s;ucceed, that of rendering them&s;elves &s;upreme|ly ridiculous.&mdash;After tea, I di&s;patched the young fry on a fi&s;hing party: &s;eated the Alderman in my father's &s;tudy (who was fortunately out of the &s;crape being gone to Lord A&s;hbury) with "the four la&s;t acts of parliament" for his companion; and was preparing to enjoy all that was left me, the fre&s;h air, and the delightful evening, when Madam arre&s;ted me with&mdash;"La! Lady Charlotte! &s;ure your La'&s;hip would not be &s;o ra&s;h as to walk in the gar|den after &s;un&s;et? I remember, la&s;t May&mdash;no, it was June,&mdash;no, no, I am right again, it was May,&mdash;when Mr. Sagely carried me out to &s;ee our neigh|bour Sir Jo&s;iah Olive's improvements, at his &s;weet little box at Newington Butts&mdash;"But as it might not improve your patience, Loui&s;a, to hear a de|&s;cription of the beauties of Newington Butts, and an enumeration of all the evils attending this ill-fated walk, I &s;hall pa&s;s them over in &s;ilence, as Mrs. Sage|ly did not do.</P>
<P>Can you figure a re&s;traint more irk&s;ome and intolerable, than that of being obliged to wear an air of &s;adne&s;s for half a day, when all the while you feel the &s;tronge&s;t propen&s;ity to laughter?&mdash;Who can help it, when one &s;ees a woman, with the appearance of health, imagine her&s;elf afflicted with every di&s;temper under Heaven? Sure I am, I may now be qualified to pre&s;cribe for all of them; for, not contented with tiring me to death with the hi&s;|tory of her complaints, I really believe there is not an alterative, an anodyne, or a cathartic, in the whole materia medica, with who&s;e various qualities, operations, and effects, I have not been made ac|quainted.&mdash;This querulous humour is the very bane of &s;ociety. What &s;atisfaction, can this poor
<PB N="7" REF="024442_0132_0FC735C0B7B76998">
wretch po&s;&s;e&s;s, whil&s;t groaning under a load of fan|cied, &s;till wor&s;e than real di&s;tre&s;s?&mdash;Yes, Heaven is ever ju&s;t; and has &s;urely compen&s;ated for her imaginary evils, by making complaint an exqui&s;ite gratification to her.</P>
<P>I went ye&s;terday to vi&s;it your poor Sally in her new habitation, which is very comfortable. She prayed for ble&s;&s;ings on us both, and thanked me with her tears. She &s;ays, &s;he is in tolerable health, but &s;eems very weak and low; and wears that look of quiet uncomplaining &s;orrow, that makes its way to the heart, without a&s;king leave of the judg|ment. The di&s;tre&s;s of tho&s;e in higher &s;tation meets with general &s;ympathy:&mdash;But who &s;hall pity the ob&s;curely mi&s;erable, e&s;pecially when they become &s;o by their own mi&s;conduct?&mdash;Ah, my friend! does this circum&s;tance le&s;&s;en their claim to compa&s;|&s;ion?&mdash;does it not greatly enhance it?</P>
<P>Adieu! Since I cannot hope to get to the Ca|&s;tle for &s;ome days, have pity on me, and render them le&s;s irk&s;ome by your pre&s;ence. If I can nei|ther promi&s;e you plea&s;ure nor in&s;truction from my pre&s;ent a&s;&s;ociates, I can at lea&s;t a&s;&s;ure you of pe|tulance, pertne&s;s, and officious politene&s;s from them, and a mo&s;t grateful and cordial reception from your</P>

<P>A new cau&s;e of perplexity and di&s;tre&s;s, my Adelaide, engages me at pre&s;ent to write to you. Were I not a&s;&s;ured that no &s;tate of mind is &s;o irk|&s;ome
<PB N="8" REF="024442_0133_0FC735C96EA74C60">
as that of li&s;tle&s;s indifference, too often the companion of a convent, I would not &s;o &s;oon make fre&s;h demands on the patience and &s;ympathy of my friend.</P>
<P>I have long &s;u&s;pected that the attentive kind|ne&s;s of Mr. Stanhope proceeded from a &s;entiment &s;till more tender than that of friend&s;hip. Fear ren|dered me but too quick-&s;ighted on this occa&s;ion. Before leaving Bath, he wrote to me, making a de|claration of a pa&s;&s;ion, which does me honour, but never can be productive of any thing but di&s;tre&s;s to us both.&mdash;I &s;trove to &s;pare him the mortification attending an un&s;ucce&s;sful &s;uit, by &s;hunning every opportunity of &s;eeing him alone; but on meeting me this morning in the garden, I was obliged to hear him on the painful &s;ubject. What an&s;wer I made to his earne&s;t &s;olicitation, I know not; but being greatly agitated, and dreading to pain a mind of &s;uch &s;en&s;ibility and delicacy as his, I fear I have not been &s;ufficiently explicit: I re&s;olve, therefore, to write to Mr. Stanhope, and convince him, that the only way to &s;ecure both my peace and his own, is to renounce a pur&s;uit which can never be attend|ed with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>His pre&s;ence here, I plainly di&s;cover, gives pain to a heart in who&s;e every unea&s;ine&s;s mine too tenderly &s;ympathi&s;es. O, Adelaide! what can I do to &s;often that pain? I am &s;hocked at my own inju&s;tice and incon&s;i&s;tency. I pity in Ha&s;tings, what I di&s;approve of in Stanhope; I condemn in him, what I indulge my&s;elf; and urge him, on ac|count of its hopele&s;&s;ne&s;s, to abandon a pa&s;&s;ion, whil&s;t I, in oppo&s;ition to honour, gratitude, nay hope it&s;elf, cheri&s;h it in my inmo&s;t &s;oul. Oh, my

Adelaide! are all the votaries of love thus unrea&s;on|able and incon&s;i&s;tent?</P>
<P>The cheerful and healthful &s;erenity, which I had ju&s;t begun to recover, is already clouded with care, anxiety, and &s;olicitude. What a mixed and ever-&s;hifting &s;cene is this of human life! What a variety of vain and re&s;tle&s;s inquietudes &s;um up the term of our tran&s;ient exi&s;tence here!&mdash;Ah! could I, like you, keep my thoughts fixed on Heaven, how trivial would appear all the &s;orrows of earth!</P>
<P>Pity me, advi&s;e me; and never, oh! never cea&s;e to love me, my friend! my monitre&s;s&mdash;my coun&s;ellor&mdash;my be&s;t and deare&s;t Adelaide!</P>

<P>The real e&s;teem and friend&s;hip I have always profe&s;&s;ed and felt for you, demands from me, on this occa&s;ion, a confidence, which I &s;hould not have tho't it incumbent on me to repo&s;e in any other man. Be a&s;&s;ured, Sir, that I am grateful for the preference you have &s;hewn me; and wi&s;h your happine&s;s &s;o ardently, that I would gladly purcha&s;e it at any expence, but that of my own honour, which I

&s;hould certainly forfeit, could I con&s;ent to give you my hand, when my heart is in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of another.</P>
<P>Let this &s;ingular proof of my e&s;teem, and reli|ance on your honour, at once confirm your friend|&s;hip, and convince you of the impo&s;&s;ibility of any other connection ever &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between us.

<P>I am certainly right, my friend. Through the thin di&s;gui&s;es of a heart that abhors deceit, and is unaccu&s;tomed to practi&s;e it, Lady Granville, the humane Lady Granville, has di&s;covered my &s;enti|ments, and took the &s;tep I mentioned in my la&s;t to prevent the fatal effects of their indulgence. A
<PB N="12" REF="024442_0137_0FC735D4D560CF10">
thou&s;and little circum&s;tances have occurred lately to per&s;uade me that it mu&s;t be &s;o; and that, al|though her gentle heart pities my weakne&s;s, her duty and intere&s;t combine with her rea&s;on to con|demn it. Of this truth the following incident will &s;erve to convince you.</P>
<P>One day, when walking with my benefactre&s;s in the garden, the conver&s;ation happened to turn on poetry.&mdash;You know Lady Granville had the mi&s;|fortune to lo&s;e, in early life, a daughter, who, though no more than &s;ix years, was every thing her &s;ond parents could de&s;ire. Among her other ex|cellencies, &s;he &s;hewed a remarkable genius for po|etry, which her indulgent mother encouraged, as it was a &s;ource of much amu&s;ement to her during the frequent confinement occa&s;ioned by a delicate con|&s;titution;&mdash;the u&s;ual concomitant of exalted genius. Striving to recollect a few &s;tanzas written by her daughter during her la&s;t illne&s;s: and being unable di&s;tinctly to repeat them, &s;he gave me her keys, and told me, I would find them in one of the draw|ers of her cabinet. The fir&s;t I opened contained the picture of Lord Ha&s;tings. I was in&s;tantly &s;eiz|ed with &s;uch a de&s;ire to obtain a copy of it, that I &s;lipt it into my pocket; and next morning, on pre|tence of purcha&s;ing &s;ome things at&mdash;, a town about &s;ix miles from the Ca&s;tle, I ordered the hor&s;es to be put to the carriage; and driving directly to my milliner's a&s;ked if &s;he knew whether there was any painter of eminence in the town? She directed me to one who was &s;aid to have &s;ame merit; I left the carriage and wal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to his Lou&s;e.&mdash;After giving him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> charges to keep the picture con|cealed, and fini&s;h the copy wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">elay, I paid for it; and de&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">red it to be &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aled up, and &s;ent to

the milliner's, who promi&s;ed to have it conveyed in &s;afety to me. There is &s;omething inexpre&s;&s;ibly pain|ful to an hone&s;t and ingenuous mind, in the little arts and &s;ubterfuges nece&s;&s;ary in the management of all clande&s;tine affairs. The mean eva&s;ions to which they lead, wound our delicacy, and do vio|lence to all our feelings. In vain, my friend, would we chicane with con&s;cience on the&s;e occa&s;ions. Her deci&s;ions are clear, and this is her language: "In whatever words you expre&s;s your meaning, if they convey not to others that &s;en&s;e in which you un|der&s;tand them your&s;elf, you are a deceiver, and &s;peak not the truth from your heart."</P>
<P>I was que&s;tioned on my return by my un&s;u&s;|pecting friend, about the bu&s;ine&s;s on which I had gone; and having neglected to purcha&s;e any thing at the milliner's, felt my&s;elf confu&s;ed and embarra&s;|&s;ed by her que&s;tion, in &s;uch a degree, as obliged me to &s;hift the di&s;cour&s;e; and, by my awkward manner of doing &s;o, probably called Lady Gran|ville's attention to a circum&s;tance, which would have otherwi&s;e pa&s;&s;ed unheeded.</P>
<P>A few days after I had re&s;tored the picture to its place, which, in order to obtain Lady Granville's keys, again forced me to have recour&s;e to an arti|fice I dete&s;ted, we received a vi&s;it from a lady in the neighbourhood; one of tho&s;e good &s;ort of go&s;|&s;iping people, who think it incumbent on them to talk, whatever be the &s;ubject.&mdash;"I hear, Madam," &s;aid &s;he, "Lord Ha&s;tings is ju&s;t going abroad; and &s;incerely congratulate your Lady&s;hip on having obtained &s;o fine a picture of your &s;on, which will certainly be mighty agreeable to you when he is at a di&s;tance."&mdash;"I do think my&s;elf fortunate on that

account," an&s;wered Lady Granville; but pray, Ma|dam, may I a&s;k how came you to know of this cir|cum&s;tance?"&mdash;"O," replied Mrs. Rawlin&s;on, with a &s;hrug and a &s;ignificant look, "I &s;aw it la&s;t week; but I &s;u&s;pect there is a &s;ecret in the ca&s;e, and that it is intended for a mi&s;tre&s;s rather than a mother,"&mdash;"How &s;o, Madam?" demanded Lady Granville.&mdash;"Why, becau&s;e, on my opening the drawer which contains the unfini&s;hed pictures, to &s;ee what additions were making to his collection, Mr.&mdash;entered the room, and &s;eemed in great vexation, on perceiving me hold your &s;on's in my hand; telling me, that nobody was permitted to examine any of the pictures, except &s;uch as were placed in the glazed box, for the in&s;pection of the public. But tru&s;t me, Madam, if you wi&s;h this affair to be con|cealed, I will be the very la&s;t per&s;on in the world to divulge it. Nobody dete&s;ts the idea of betraying a &s;ecret more than I do."&mdash;"Indeed, Madam," re|plied Lady Granville gravely, and fixing her pene|trating eyes on my face (the fir&s;t time I ever thought them unplea&s;ing) "if there is any &s;ecret in the ca&s;e, I am entirely ignorant of it."</P>
<P>The perturbation I &s;uffered during this di&s;|cour&s;e, is not to be de&s;cribed&mdash;Unable to &s;upport the pre&s;ence of Lady Granville, I ro&s;e and left the room. I &s;aw, with angui&s;h, that &s;he entertained &s;u&s;picions, which every attempt to remove would only &s;erve to corroborate, and involve me in fre&s;h perplexity and li&s;tre&s;s. I re&s;olved, therefore, to take no notice of what had pa&s;&s;ed, and rather to hazard the di&s;plea&s;ure of Lady Granville, than de|viate from the &s;traight path of &s;incerity.</P>

The day following, &s;he &s;ent for me into her dre&s;&s;ing-room.&mdash;I entered it with the horror of a &s;elf-condemned criminal.&mdash;Oh, Adelaide! what mu&s;t be the angui&s;h of guilty remor&s;e, when an error like mine could awaken &s;uch painful con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s?&mdash;Lady Granville took hold of my hand, and, with a look of earne&s;t &s;olicitude and compa&s;|&s;ion, "My dear child," &s;aid &s;he, "your's is a no|ble &s;oul&mdash;I am going to give you a proof that I know how to admire, how to value your merit&mdash;Would it were mine to reward it!"

<P>Stanhope continues to &s;olicit my friend&s;hip&mdash;my pity&mdash;&s;ince he can no longer hope to convert it into a more tender &s;entiment. Heaven knows, I both pity and e&s;teem, but never, never can love him.</P>

<P>Ah! Loui&s;a, is it nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould &s;ee&mdash;that I &s;hould conver&s;e with Lord Ha&s;tings, in order to pity and excu&s;e what you term your weakne&s;s? Alas! I need but to recollect my own. But &s;hall I indeed be&s;tow that name on the &s;weete&s;t, mo&s;t ennobling affection of the &s;oul?&mdash;Oh! Grammont, was it weakne&s;s to love thee? Is it criminal to de|plore thee?&mdash;My offence then will end but with my life!&mdash;The walls of a convent may conceal our &s;orrows from the world, but it will not bani&s;h them from our thoughts; its &s;olitude and &s;ilence are but too favourable to their indulgence.</P>
<P>This day, my Loui&s;a&mdash;this memorable day&mdash;was the la&s;t of my earthly happine&s;s!&mdash;It was that on which Grammont informed me of his &s;ucce&s;s, and added to all my plea&s;ing hopes, that of his &s;pee|dy return.&mdash;Alas! how &s;oon were they bla&s;ted for ever!</P>
<P>Yet think not, Loui&s;a, that I always indulge the&s;e melancholy reflections.&mdash;No; I do not, in bewailing the lo&s;s of my deare&s;t ble&s;&s;ing, ungrate|fully overlook tho&s;e which &s;till remain. I even at times look back on pa&s;t plea&s;ures with more real

&s;atisfaction than half the world experience in the enjoyment of tho&s;e that are pre&s;ent. There is a con&s;cious dignity as well as tenderne&s;s in virtuous &s;orrow;&mdash;and far rather would I recall to mind the virtues of Grammont, and weep for his lo&s;s, than have lived to witne&s;s either the frailties or faults of a character &s;o loved and revered: And who can hope, in this mortal &s;tate, to be entirely exempted from either?&mdash;Though he &s;hall never return to me, I &s;hall &s;oon go to him; and then what will all the &s;orrows, &s;ufferings, and vexing inquietudes of this life appear, but as the confu&s;ed &s;hadows of a trou|bled dream, from which we awake to real and &s;ub|&s;tantial felicity!</P>
<P>Let reflections like the&s;e carry peace and con|&s;olation to the gentle bo&s;om of my friend; and let us not dwell on evils that are pa&s;t, and which never would have been pre&s;ent, had not &s;ome important purpo&s;e rendered them nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Do not regret intere&s;ting me in your &s;orrows, Loui&s;a. A dead calm is the wor&s;t &s;tate of the hu|man mind. Some agitation is nece&s;&s;ary to maintain its proper temperament; and it is be&s;t when this is the effect, rather of the &s;ocial than the &s;elfi&s;h principle. The one is like the breath of Heaven on the peaceful lake, who&s;e gentle motion purifies and clears;&mdash;the other re&s;embles a vortex in a trou|bled pool, which ab&s;orbs every thing of worth, and &s;ends its feculencies to the &s;urface.</P>
<P>You tell me, that "tears of mingled admira|tion and gratitude interrupt your peru&s;al of my let|ters." How &s;oothing, how flattering is &s;uch prai&s;e?

How preferable to the applau&s;e of a giddy and ca|pricious world? The applau&s;e of that world is too often obtained by the mere di&s;play of tho&s;e talents, in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of which there can be no merit; it lies &s;olely, my friend, in the ju&s;t application of them.</P>
<P>Adieu, my Loui&s;a&mdash;I pity, I &s;ympathi&s;e in your &s;orrows; would I could relieve them!&mdash;You have my prayers, my wi&s;hes, my con&s;tant tender affection.

<P>The mode&s;t and engaging manners of Mr. Stan|hope conciliated the e&s;teem of all with whom he conver&s;ed. Even Lord Ha&s;tings, though he re|garded him in the light of a rival, with that great|ne&s;s of mind which &s;uppre&s;&s;es the malevolent, and conquers the &s;elfi&s;h pa&s;&s;ions, joined on all occa&s;ions in doing ju&s;tice to his merit.&mdash;With re&s;pect to Loui&s;a's &s;entiments of this gentleman, he was &s;till in painful &s;u&s;pen&s;e. She often &s;poke of him in high terms; but &s;he &s;poke of him without any marks of that he&s;itating caution, which betrays that tenderne&s;s it is meant to conceal. She profe&s;&s;ed her&s;elf his friend with &s;uch unaffected ea&s;e, that Lord Ha&s;tings flattered him&s;elf &s;he would never become his wife.</P>
<P>In &s;pite of every attempt to conceal the di&s;tre&s;s and perturbation of her mind, the dejection of Lou|i&s;a became every day more apparent. It did not e&s;cape Lord Ha&s;tings; who, ignorant of the real cau&s;e, and judging of her's by his own feelings,

&s;ometimes ventured to hope, that regret for his ap|proaching departure had a &s;hare in her unea&s;ine&s;s. The &s;ingular ingenuity and noblene&s;s of her con|duct to Mr. Stanhope, did not tend to le&s;&s;en a pa&s;|&s;ion, which was in&s;pired by her merit, and who&s;e chief object was her happine&s;s. But the confidence &s;he had repo&s;ed in him, added &s;uch gratitude and tenderne&s;s to his other &s;entiments, that &s;he often felt real plea&s;ure in his conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>Matters were in this train, when Lady Charlotte joined the agreeable party at Ca&s;tle Ha&s;tings.&mdash;The frequent vi&s;its &s;he made there, had furni&s;hed her with opportunities of becoming pretty well ac|quainted with the &s;entiments of all parties. Her charming &s;pirits were a cordial, of which they &s;tood in great need.&mdash;She plainly perceived the pa&s;&s;ion of Lord Ha&s;tings for Mi&s;s Seymour; and though &s;he had once hoped to have become the object of it her&s;elf, &s;he was too generous now to harbour &s;uch a wi&s;h, &s;ince &s;he was convinced, that any pre|ference for her, on the part of Lord Ha&s;tings, would be de&s;tructive of the peace of her amiable young friend. She remarked the uncommon dejection of Loui&s;a, which &s;he attributed &s;olely to the pro&s;pect of being divided from the object of her &s;ecret at|tachment; being entirely ignorant of Lord Gran|ville's views, and the conver&s;ation that had pa&s;&s;ed on that &s;ubject between Lady Granville and Mi&s;s Seymour. She po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed too much goodne&s;s of heart, as well as delicacy, to rally her friend on &s;o tender a point; and generou&s;ly &s;trove to divert her thoughts from it, by &s;uch lively &s;allies and amu&s;ing conver|&s;ations, as &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed mo&s;t likely to produce that effect.</P>

<P>The po&s;&s;ibility of Mi&s;s Seymour &s;pending the winter in London, where her beauty could not fail to attract a crowd of admirers, had never once en|tered the thoughts of Lord Ha&s;tings.

<P>Without perceiving his unea&s;ine&s;s, Lady Char|lotte thus proceeded:&mdash;"Don't you think, my Lord, there is &s;ome little chance, that a trip to Lon|don might &s;till make away with the&s;e &s;trange anti|quated notions of Mi&s;s Seymour's?"&mdash;"Perhaps, Madam," an&s;wered he gravely, "London might alter many of Mi&s;s Seymour's pre&s;ent opinions; but I doubt much whether tho&s;e &s;he would receive there in return, would prove either agreeable or advantageous. There is more hazard, Lady Char|lotte, than you are aware of, in the manners of the great world.

<P>Mr Stanhope withdraw; and Loui&s;a turning down a path that led into a fine field, continued her

walk, till &s;he reached a bench &s;haded with a large che&s;nut tree, on which &s;he &s;at down, and gave way to the &s;orrows that oppre&s;&s;ed her heart.</P>
<P>A few minutes after Mi&s;s Seymour quitted the drawing-room, Lord Ha&s;tings, on retiring to the window for air, &s;aw Mr. Stanhope enter the pavi|lion. He was in&s;tantly &s;eized with a fit of jealou&s;y; and &s;upporting that it was the &s;cene of an appoint|ment between them, could not re&s;i&s;t the de&s;ire, which that envious pa&s;&s;ion in&s;pired, of at lea&s;t inter|rupting their happine&s;s, &s;ince he could not prevent their meeting. As he approached the pavilion, his heart throbbed &s;o violently, that he was obliged to &s;top to recover him&s;elf. The windows being all thrown open, and &s;haded with honey&s;uckle, gave him an opportunity of witne&s;&s;ing this affecting in|terview, without being ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>The tears of Loui&s;a wrung his heart; and, utterly at a lo&s;s of gue&s;s the cau&s;e which excited them, he drew nearer the window, at the very in&s;tant Mr. Stanhope pronounced this &s;entence,&mdash;"If I am lo&s;t to happine&s;s my&s;elf," &amp;c. In a moment the whole truth &s;eemed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">la&s;h on his mind; the fre|quent changes in Loui&s;a's manner, her continual melancholy, her rejection of Mr. Stanhope's ad|dre&s;&s;es, all convinced the unhappy Ha&s;tings, that there was a favoured rival in the heart of Mi&s;s Sey|mour, who&s;e ab&s;ence occa&s;ioned her di&s;tre&s;s, and whom it would be equally vain and di&s;honourable to endeavour to &s;upplant.</P>
<P>To meet with coldne&s;s and indifference from a heart which has in&s;pired us with the mo&s;t tender &s;entiments, is afflicting in the highe&s;t degree: But
<PB N="26" REF="024442_0151_0FC7360206C17248">
what can equal the angui&s;h of knowing that the heart we ardently covet is actually in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of another?</P>
<P>Lord Ha&s;tings &s;tood &s;till, till Mi&s;s Seymour and Mr. Stanhope were both out of &s;ight; and then, en|tering the pavilion, threw him&s;elf on the &s;opha &s;he had ju&s;t quitted. He reviewed the happy hours he had &s;pent with her during Lady Granville's con|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">inement, when he almo&s;t believed he was beloved; and execrated that ra&s;h curio&s;ity, which had for ever robbed him of the &s;weet delu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Loui&s;a, after having recour&s;e to the &s;oothing let|ters of Adelaide, &s;ome of which &s;he always carried in her pocket, and which, by their pious and &s;olemn reflections, never failed to calm the di&s;turbed &s;oul of her friend, being now tolerably compo&s;ed, ventu|red to return to the drawing-room.</P>
<P>Unable to bear the re&s;traint of company, and wholly engro&s;&s;ed by his own reflections, Lord Ha&s;|tings took the &s;ame road Mi&s;s Seymour had quitted, and wandered down the field.</P>
<P>As he approached the bench, his attention was rou&s;ed, by &s;eeing a paper lying on the ground. He picked it up; it was without &s;eal or &s;uper&s;cription; but as he had no doubt of its having been dropt by Mi&s;s Seymour, he re&s;olved to re&s;tore it unopened. At that in&s;tant, recollecting the delight he had ex|perienced on a former occa&s;ion, from the peru&s;al of what &s;he had written, and &s;uppo&s;ing this might contain &s;uch another tran&s;cript of her heart, he could not deny him&s;elf the &s;atisfaction of di&s;co|vering at this cri&s;is what were its inmo&s;t thoughts.
<PB N="27" REF="024442_0152_0FC73603CDA466B0">
&mdash;Perhaps it is &s;afer, on &s;ome occa&s;ions, to com|mit a &s;light offence with one's eyes open, than by &s;eeking for rea&s;ons to excu&s;e the commi&s;&s;ion of it, to endanger our mental &s;ight, and blind our under&s;tand|ing with the mi&s;t of fal&s;e argument.&mdash;He opened the letter, which proved to be that from Grammont to Adelaide; which Loui&s;a, in the agitation of her mind immediately after reading it, had forgotten to re&s;tore. He &s;aw that it was not the hand of a female.&mdash;What was his amazement, when he read the&s;e words? "At length, mo&s;t beloved of women, your fond lover, your faithful friend, ta&s;tes of real tran&s;port, by being able to convey it to you," &amp;c.</P>
<P>Having fini&s;hed the letter, a deep &s;igh bur&s;t from his bo&s;om:&mdash;"There is then no hope under Heaven remaining for me!" cried he, in a tone of de&s;pond|ing &s;orrow. Then after a pau&s;e&mdash;"Yes; that of &s;eeing Loui&s;a happy. Fortune &s;eems to oppo&s;e the union of two hearts formed for each other;&mdash;would I too oppo&s;e it?

Thank Heaven! though I am wretched my&s;elf, it may &s;till be in my power to ren|der her happy; and to re&s;tore peace to the bo&s;om of the gentle&s;t, mo&s;t amiable of human kind."&mdash;&mdash;Full of the&s;e &s;entiments, &s;o worthy of him&s;elf, he &s;ought for an opportunity of conver&s;ing with Mi&s;s Seymour in private, which &s;he as &s;tudiou&s;ly avoided.</P>
<P>The evening before his departure, ob&s;erving her walking alone in the garden, he followed her; and on her entering the pavilion, &s;topped to reflect in what manner he ought to addre&s;s her. She appear|ed lo&s;t in thought; a heavy &s;igh betrayed the deep di&s;tre&s;s which occa&s;ioned it; and after remaining &s;ome time in a reverie, which Lord Ha&s;tings was
<PB N="28" REF="024442_0153_0FC736079E4D6A70">
unwilling to interrupt, &s;he aro&s;e, and retiring to the oppo&s;ite window, from whence &s;he could &s;ee any per&s;on that entered the garden, &s;he drew out of her bo&s;om his picture, which hung from her neck by a &s;mall &s;tring of pearls. The agitation of Lord Ha&s;tings on this occa&s;ion was extreme: What would it have been, could he have di&s;covered that it was his own features &s;he was then contempla|ting!&mdash;After looking on it for &s;ome time in &s;ilence, &s;he ki&s;&s;ed and bathed it with her tears: Then, in a low and mournful tone,&mdash;"Yes," &s;aid &s;he, "for|tune and duty oppo&s;e our happine&s;s:&mdash;Ab&s;ence may blot my image from thy heart; but no power on earth can rob me of the dear delight of loving thee tenderly,&mdash;loving thee only,&mdash;loving thee for ever!"</P>
<P>Lord Ha&s;tings could &s;upport this &s;cene no longer. He came round to the door of the pavilion; at &s;ight of him Loui&s;a &s;tarted back with &s;urpri&s;e, and in great confu&s;ion, ha&s;tily returning the picture into her bo&s;om, prepared to retire.&mdash;Taking hold of her hand, he led her gently back to the &s;opha, and &s;eating him&s;elf by her,&mdash;"O Loui&s;a!" &s;aid he, "why do you avoid me? What have I done to in|cur your hatred."&mdash;"My hatred, my Lord!" &s;aid &s;he,&mdash;and again was &s;ilent.&mdash;"Yes, Mi&s;s Sey|mour, it is too plain you hate, you fly me!&mdash;I am not con&s;cious of having merited your di&s;plea&s;ure, but you cannot be unju&s;t. Ah, Loui&s;a!" continued he, fixing his mournful eyes on her's, which were &s;treaming with tears, "where are all tho&s;e happy moments fled that we once enjoyed together, when I cheri&s;hed for you &s;entiments that I dared not di&s;|cover, that I mu&s;t for ever hold &s;acred; that I once&mdash;O forgive me!&mdash;thought you beheld without

contempt. But I deceived my&s;elf, and am now puni&s;hed for my pre&s;umption."&mdash;Loui&s;a was now forced to have recour&s;e to her &s;alts; he perceived the agony of her mind, and ha&s;tened to put an end to the conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>"I am no &s;tranger, Mi&s;s Seymour," continued he, "to the cau&s;e of my misfortune. Permit me, ere I go, to be&s;tow on you the means of happine&s;s, which are now u&s;ele&s;s in my hands:&mdash;Think &s;ome|times on the ab&s;ent Ha&s;tings, who will never cea&s;e to think of you; and who, though he cannot be the &s;harer of your heart, mu&s;t for ever be the friend of your virtues.&mdash;Deign to accept of this trinket; and let it remind you of a man who prefers your felicity to his own."</P>
<P>During this &s;peech, great part of which &s;he could not then comprehend, Loui&s;a was in a &s;tate to be conceived, not de&s;cribed. The trinket with which Lord Ha&s;tings pre&s;ented her, was a locket inclo&s;ing his hair, enamelled with the initials of his name, and richly &s;et with brilliants. She received it with a look of acknowledgment; and at length found compo&s;ure &s;ufficient to add, in a tone of inexpre&s;&s;i|ble tenderne&s;s,&mdash;"Be a&s;&s;ured, my Lord, I have no need of this remembrancer. I &s;hall never forget you; and wherever you go, my prayers and be&s;t wi&s;hes &s;hall attend you."&mdash;She ro&s;e;&mdash;"I have only one other reque&s;t to make, Mi&s;s Seymour," &s;aid he; "it is, that you will take charge of this packet till after Iam gone; you may then break the &s;eal, and di&s;po&s;e of the contents as directed."</P>
<P>He retired, leaving Mi&s;s Seymour di&s;tracted with the variety, as well as violence of her emotions.
<PB N="30" REF="024442_0155_0FC7360F7A166C20">
She repeated every word he had uttered a thou&s;and times; and every time found her&s;elf le&s;s able to unravel their meaning. The packet too furni&s;hed her with many conjectures; but &s;he re&s;olved to obey his injunctions with the &s;tricte&s;t fidelity.</P>
<P>She returned to her apartment with &s;o violent a head-ach, and in &s;uch agitation of &s;pirits, that it was late before &s;he joined the company; but though &s;he wi&s;hed above all things to avoid a formal part|ing with Lord Ha&s;tings, &s;he dreaded the &s;u&s;picion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;he might incur by appearing to &s;hun it.</P>
<P>After a dull and &s;ilent &s;upper, &s;he ro&s;e to retire. "Mi&s;s Seymour," &s;aid Lord Granville, "do you remember, Ha&s;tings &s;ets out to-morrow, won't you wi&s;h him a good journey?"&mdash;"I do, with all my heart, my Lord," an&s;wered &s;he. Lord Ha&s;tings &s;aluted her; and following her to the door, he &s;eized her trembling hand, which he pre&s;&s;ed to his bo&s;om&mdash;"O, Loui&s;a!" &s;aid he, "may Heaven's be&s;t ble&s;&s;ings &s;urround you, and may you be com|pletely happy, whatever become of the ill-fated Ha&s;tings."</P>
<P>Loui&s;a retired to bed, but not to &s;leep. Of all the pa&s;&s;ions which warred in her bo&s;om, and ban|i&s;hed &s;leep from her eyes, curio&s;ity was the mo&s;t violent, as well as painful. She aro&s;e by day-break; and the moment &s;he heard the carriage of Lord Ha&s;tings drive from the door, &s;he broke the &s;eal, with a trembling hand and beating heart.

<P>The letter to which Lord Ha&s;tings alluded, was that from Grammont to Adelaide. Under the &s;ame cover were two bank bills for a thou&s;and pounds each, and a promi&s;&s;ory note for three more, to be p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> at Lord Granville's death.</P>
<P>It is difficult to &s;ay, whether admiration, grati|tude, &s;orrow, or love, at this moment predominated in the agitated &s;oul of Loui&s;a; but though they al|ternately &s;trove for dominion there, they at la&s;t yielded to that melancholy regret, that exqui&s;ite &s;ympathy in the affliction of Lord Ha&s;tings, which excited the mo&s;t ardent, though unavailing, wi&s;hes to relieve it.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Though it is painful to lie under unmerited cen|&s;ure, there is a pride attending con&s;cious virtue, which makes her di&s;dain to &s;olicit a hearing, in order to vindicate a conduct which &s;he is &s;en&s;ible merits prai&s;e.&mdash;Mi&s;s Seymour either &s;aw, or
<PB N="33" REF="024442_0158_0FC73619DB0A5148">
thought &s;he &s;aw, an alteration in Lady Granville's manner towards her, ever &s;ince the unlucky affair of the picture: This gave her extreme pain; but pride and mode&s;ty both oppo&s;ed at that time a con|fe&s;&s;ion of her weakne&s;s. Unaccu&s;tomed to re&s;traint or concealment, it grew every day more painful to her; and &s;he re&s;olved, as &s;oon as Lord Ha&s;tings &s;hould leave the Ca&s;tle, to communicate all that had pa&s;&s;ed between them to his mother.</P>
<P>On going into Lady Granville's dre&s;&s;ing-room, &s;he found her &s;pirits extremely depre&s;&s;ed on account of her &s;on's departure. She mingled her tears with her's, and &s;ugge&s;ted every thing mo&s;t likely to &s;up|port her &s;pirits. "If I cannot con&s;ole your heart, my dear Madam," &s;aid &s;he, "for the ab&s;ence of your &s;on, let me at lea&s;t prove my&s;elf worthy the name of daughter, with which you honour me, by laying open mine to your view.&mdash;I am per&s;uaded you are not ignorant of the &s;entiments he has long entertain|ed for me; but however flattering to me, in ju&s;tice to you and to my&s;elf, I wi&s;h to convince you, that I have never given encouragement to them."</P>
<P>She then &s;uccinctly related all that had pa&s;&s;ed be|tween her and Lord Ha&s;tings at their la&s;t interview; and taking out the packet, and at the &s;ame time pre&s;enting her with her an&s;wer to the letter from Lord Ha&s;tings,&mdash;"Read this, Madam," &s;aid &s;he, "and in&s;truct me, if you wi&s;h me to make any alterations in it."</P>
<P>Lady Granville peru&s;ed the letters with vi&s;ible emotion. Then ri&s;ing and throwing her arms round Loui&s;a's neck, which &s;he bathed with tears of ming|led admiration and tenderne&s;s,&mdash;"No, my amiable,

<P>Lord Ha&s;tings wrote to his mother almo&s;t every po&s;t; but though he never omitted enquiring after Mi&s;s Seymour's health, he carefully avoided men|tioning her in any other terms than tho&s;e dictated by politene&s;s.</P>
<P>As he did not entertain a doubt concerning the object of her tenderne&s;s, he was not a little a&s;toni&s;h|ed to learn, on his arrival at Paris, that the Count de Rochelle had been married for &s;everal months. This at once accounted to him for Loui&s;a's melan|choly, and in&s;pired a fond hope, that it yet might be in his power, by a tender, con&s;tant, a&s;&s;iduous pa&s;&s;ion, to remove it. He knew too well the bitter angui&s;h of di&s;appointment, not to feel mo&s;t exqui|&s;ite &s;orrow for Mi&s;s Seymour, on account of this &s;uppo&s;ed misfortune&mdash;of all others, &s;urely the mo&s;t in&s;upportable&mdash;that of the cruelty and perfidy of a per&s;on in whom we have repo&s;ed unbounded confi|dence, and from whom we have expected all our felicity.</P>
<P>Some weeks after Lord Ha&s;tings arrived at Paris, Loui&s;a received the following letter from Adelaide, in an&s;wer to the introductory one, of which he was the bearer:&mdash;</P>

to do either without plea&s;ure and admiration. He has paid me &s;everal vi&s;its, each of which has &s;erved to confirm my opinion of his noble and gene|rous character.&mdash;He &s;poke but little of my Loui&s;a; when he did, it was the language of unfeigned prai&s;e. He a&s;ked a thou&s;and que&s;tions about Ro|chelle; every one of which betrayed the intere&s;t his heart took in the &s;ubject; but in&s;tructed by your letter, I purpo&s;ely avoided it: This he &s;aw, and I doubt not his &s;u&s;picions were confirmed by it. The Count de Rochelle was married &s;ome time ago to Madamoi&s;elle St. Hermoine; and I plainly perceive, is &s;u&s;pected by Lord Ha&s;tings of having acted di&s;honourably by you.

<P>By this time my dear Henry will have reached Paris, and mingled with the promi&s;cuous crowd that forms the &s;ociety of that large and licentious metropolis.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t a people learned in the arts of &s;educ|tion, and ardent in the pur&s;uit of plea&s;ure, how much will it behove you to maintain that manly firmne&s;s of character, for which I have &s;o often ap|plauded you.&mdash;I apprehend no danger to you from the gro&s;sly vicious, or openly profane: Such in&s;pire a mind like your's, with horror and di&s;gu&s;t. But I

confe&s;s, my &s;on, I am not without fear, from the in&s;idious arts of the rea&s;oning &s;ceptic, and &s;y&s;tema|tic libertine. The ridicule thrown on every thing &s;erious, by the polite circles of our &s;ex, is &s;everely mortifying to the delicate &s;en&s;ibility of youth, and highly di&s;couraging to virtuous conduct. And the cruel refinements of a mi&s;taken philo&s;ophy, have of late years given double weight to opinions, over which pa&s;&s;ion and appetite had ever too powerful an in|fluence.&mdash;The &s;ole pre&s;ervative of popular morality, is religion. Whenever the vulgar are taught to &s;corn her re&s;traints, they &s;oon de&s;pi&s;e tho&s;e of virtue. Vice ru&s;hes in like an impetuous torrent, which has overwhelmed its bounds, and carried all before it.&mdash;The dim-&s;ighted multitude are unable to perceive the nice di&s;criminations between real and apparent intere&s;t. Religion held forth a faithful gla&s;s, to aid their imperfect &s;en&s;e: Infidelity da&s;hes this to earth, and in its &s;tead, pre&s;ents the rabble with a delu&s;ive mirror, which magnifies contiguous objects, and &s;hews them in alluring colours, whil&s;t it imbibes the rays which would delineate the back ground.</P>
<P>You know I have always been of opinion, that piety is the only &s;ure foundation of moral conduct.&mdash;What ingenuous motive can affect that mind, which is regardle&s;s of its obligations to infinite be|neficence?&mdash;Sophi&s;ts may argue and refine as they will, but there can be no genuine virtue, independ|ent of true piety.</P>
<P>We daily &s;ee proofs of the inefficacy of &s;pecu|lative opinions, to regulate the actions of men. The under&s;tanding often a&s;&s;ents to truths which never reach the heart. A feeling and habitual &s;en&s;e of Deity&mdash;a love of tho&s;e divine precepts&mdash;a belief of
<PB N="39" REF="024442_0164_0FC73629B80D9048">
tho&s;e &s;ublime doctrines&mdash;a hope of tho&s;e eternal rewards he hath revealed, will be found ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to counterbalance the &s;uddenne&s;s of temp|tation, the force of example, and the con&s;tant &s;oli|citations to criminal indulgence.</P>
<P>One con&s;ideration will have much weight with a mind po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;en&s;ibility like your's: the in|fluence of your example may extend much farther than you are aware of. To a generous &s;oul, how en|nobling, how elevating is the thought, that by a truly amiable and virtuous conduct, we may induce the wicked and unhappy to quit the paths of vice and de&s;truction, and pur&s;ue tho&s;e that are plea&s;ant|ne&s;s and peace; not only in their termination, but in their tenor al&s;o.&mdash;A corrupt &s;ociety is to the world, what a corrupt member is to a &s;ociety. The whole &s;eems in a great mea&s;ure dependent, even on its &s;malle&s;t parts. What &s;olid value &s;hould this idea give us in our own e&s;timation; and how cautious ought we to be, le&s;t our errors prove in|ductive of evil, where our goodne&s;s may never reach.</P>
<P>Should you continue, my dear Henry, to per|&s;evere in the practice of virtue and goodne&s;s, my utmo&s;t ambition in this world will be gratified; and the heart of a father, to whom you are un&s;peaka|bly dear, will triumph in the con&s;cious pride and joy of paternal affection.</P>

<P>I am &s;o greatly agitated at pre&s;ent, my dear Loui&s;a, with the affecting &s;cene I have ju&s;t wit|ne&s;&s;ed, and which your weak &s;pirits could never have &s;upported, that I am very unequal to the ta&s;k of writing.</P>
<P>Alas! our poor afflicted Sally is no more!&mdash;I received a note this morning from nur&s;e, begging to &s;ee me immediately: I &s;et out for her cottage
<PB N="41" REF="024442_0166_0FC7362FB8FB8258">
without a moment's delay. On my arrival, the worthy creature met me at the door, and, with eyes &s;wimming in tears, told me that poor Sally was de|livered la&s;t night of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ine girl, who was &s;tout and healthy, but &s;he feared the mother was in great danger.</P>
<P>Though &s;he bore her &s;ufferings with much pa|tience and re&s;olution, the moment &s;he heard the child cry, &s;he bur&s;t into a violent flood of tears, which greatly agitated her weak frame. She a&s;ked to &s;ee it as &s;oon as it was dre&s;&s;ed; on its being brought, &s;he took it in her arms, gazed on it, ki&s;&s;ed and bathed it with her tears; then taking a little locket from her own neck, containing its father's hair, &s;he tied it round that of the infant, &s;aying, "Unfortunate innocent!&mdash;Alas! this, and the name of Sally, is all I have to bequeath thee!&mdash;Thou mu&s;t not pre&s;ume to claim that of thy unkind father!</P>
<P>This exertion was too much for her feeble bo|dy and exhau&s;ted &s;pirits: She was &s;eized with faint|ings, which threatened to put an in&s;tant period to her life. The phy&s;ician ordered her to be kept per|fectly quiet, and begged nur&s;e to have the child re|moved as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, as the &s;ound of its voice always threw her into agonies. She had &s;ometimes dropped a&s;leep through the night, but con&s;tantly waked &s;tarting, with &s;ome exc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">mation of terror; &s;he complained of violent &s;ickne&s;s and palpitation at her heart, and had been delirious for &s;everal hours.</P>
<P>On hearing her talking to her&s;elf in a low voice, I &s;lipped &s;oftly to the bed-&s;ide: Her eyes were &s;hut, but I heard her di&s;tinctly pronounce the
<PB N="42" REF="024442_0167_0FC736320573DFC0">
following &s;entences: "Cruel deceiver!&mdash;faithle&s;s Talbot! why did you leave me?&mdash;Did I not give you my whole heart?&mdash;I never did any thing to offend you, but loving you too fondly. If Heaven forgives my offences, oh, Talbot! you might have pardoned this!&mdash;Shall the&s;e eyes never again be|hold thee?&mdash;Unkind Talbot! wilt thou never, ne|ver, never return? But I &s;hall &s;oon be at peace."&mdash;Then hearing her infant cry&mdash;"Pitying God!" &s;he exclaimed, "defend this helple&s;s, de&s;olate babe! It is guiltle&s;s of its mother's crime!&mdash;Oh, Talbot! had&s;t thou heard this voice, unkind as thou art, thou could&s;t not have left me?&mdash;Yet, do not re|turn; it would grieve thee to &s;ee my grave&mdash;I would die rather than grieve thee!&mdash;I &s;hall &s;oon go to Heaven&mdash;Ah, Talbot! could I but hope to meet thee there!</P>
<P>She fell into a &s;lumber for a few minutes. I &s;at down by her bed-&s;ide.&mdash;Oh, my Loui&s;a! who could behold unmoved &s;uch a &s;cene of woe?</P>
<P>Again &s;tarting up, and ha&s;tily drawing back the curtain, &s;he exclaimed, looking wildly round her, "Where, oh! where is he?&mdash;Did I not &s;ee him here?&mdash;Gone again! Gone for ever!"&mdash;Then &s;inking down on her pillow, pale and exhau&s;t|ed, &s;he &s;lowly repeated, in a &s;olemn tone&mdash;"Trou|ble and angui&s;h are come upon me!&mdash;My purpo&s;es are broken off, even the thoughts of my heart!&mdash;As for my hope, who &s;hall &s;ee it?"&mdash;Here &s;he pau&s;ed, as if to recover breath; and then proceed|ed:&mdash;"My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me: They whom I loved are turned again&s;t me!&mdash;Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God

He lieth down, and ri&s;eth not, till the Heavens be no more!"&mdash;After again pau&s;ing a few minutes, &s;he cla&s;ped her hands together, and, rai&s;ing her dim eyes to Hea|ven, prayed, in a low and feeble voice, interrupted with &s;ighs: "Impute not, gracious God! who knoweth our frame&mdash;O, impute not guilt!&mdash;Pity the errors of youth, not perver&s;ene&s;s.&mdash;Father of the afflicted! protect my child&mdash;&s;ave from ruin him I loved&mdash;Receive, oh! receive thy humble penitent to the arms of thy everla&s;ting mercy!"&mdash;Here her faintings &s;ucceeded each other &s;o rapidly, that nature, unable longer to &s;upport &s;o unequal a &s;trug|gle, &s;unk altogether; and in a few minutes &s;he ex|pired in my arms.</P>

<P>This letter, and the melancholy and unexpected fate of the unfortunate Sally, pierced the &s;oul of Loui&s;a with the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite &s;orrow. But though her &s;en&s;ibility was extreme, it never unfitted her for the di&s;charge of any active or &s;ocial duty. By the care of the be&s;t of mothers, &s;he had early learn|ed to repre&s;s tho&s;e feelings, who&s;e over-indulgence would have been ruinous to her own peace, and injurious to &s;ociety, by depriving them of tho&s;e
<PB N="46" REF="024442_0171_0FC73641778ADF40">
good offices which are the offspring of genuine and well-regulated &s;ympathy.</P>
<P>She &s;et out immediately for the Marquis of Win|che&s;ter's; from whence the two ladies walked to the nur&s;e's hou&s;e. At the &s;ight of the little infant, Mi&s;s Seymour was greatly affected; nor would &s;he be denied the mournful plea&s;ure of beholding for the la&s;t time the a&s;&s;ociate of her earlie&s;t years. On uncovering the corp&s;e, and &s;eeing the pale and ema|ciated, but placid countenance of her youthful com|panion, &s;he cla&s;ped her hands together in an agony of grief, and turning to Lady Charlotte, who &s;tood by her &s;ide in &s;ilent &s;orrow&mdash;"Behold, my friend," &s;aid &s;he, "the fatal effects of cruel and head&s;trong pa&s;&s;ion! Behold the &s;ad remains of youth, beauty, &s;weetne&s;s, innocence! Almighty God! &s;hall the creatures of thy power, the monuments of thy mer|cy, the daily &s;harers of thy bounty, for the &s;ake of indulging a criminal impul&s;e, thus inhumanly, thus deliberately de&s;troy each other?&mdash;Is it po&s;&s;ible, is it really po&s;&s;ible," &s;he continued, "that &s;he whom, but a few months ago, I beheld &s;o blooming, health|ful, and innocent, who&s;e graceful form, endearing mode&s;ty, and ineffable &s;weetne&s;s, excited my admi|ration, is now a pale, breathle&s;s, cold, in&s;en&s;ible corp&s;e?"&mdash;Then &s;tooping down and ki&s;&s;ing her lifele&s;s cheek,&mdash;"Farewel! farewel for ever!" &s;aid &s;he, "dear, unfortunate, but too credulous Sally: May thy virtues live in my faithful heart, and may thy errors for ever be buried in thy grave."</P>
<P>Having appointed a hired carriage to meet them at the nur&s;e's hou&s;e, they bid her adieu; and ha|ving carefully wrapt up their infant-charge, pro|ceeded to Ca&s;tle Ha&s;tings: in the neighbourhood
<PB N="47" REF="024442_0172_0FC73644B3411FD0">
of which lived a woman, who having ju&s;t lo&s;t a child whom &s;he &s;uckled, was glad to have its place &s;upplied by a fo&s;ter.</P>
<P>Having di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the chai&s;e, Lady Charlotte walk|ed &s;lowly towards the Ca&s;tle, to avoid ob&s;ervation, whil&s;t Mi&s;s Seymour conveyed the little baby in her arms to the cottage.</P>
<P>The aver&s;ion &s;he felt for every &s;pecies of dupli|city, joined to her de&s;ire of concealing the weakne&s;s of Sally for ever from the world, induced her to be very &s;ilent on the &s;ubject of the child. She told the good woman, however, that though the child had few friends to care for it, &s;he &s;hould have eve|ry thing provided for it, and be amply rewarded for the proper di&s;charge of her duty.</P>
<P>Though this melancholy affair made a deep and la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ion on the heart of Loui&s;a, her humane attention to this poor babe &s;erved both to &s;ooth her &s;orrow, and fill up that joyle&s;s void which the ab&s;ence of Lord Ha&s;tings occa&s;ioned in her mind.&mdash;Pru|dence obliged her to re&s;trict the number of her vi|&s;its to the cottage; but as it &s;tood at a very &s;mall di&s;tance from the Ca&s;tle, &s;he frequently directed her walks that way, without hazard of incurring &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>In one of her &s;olitary rambles, which &s;he had ex|tended to a con&s;iderable length, her thoughts being occupied with tho&s;e tender reflections which wrap the pen&s;ive mind in a &s;weet delirium, recollecting that &s;he was within a few paces of the field in which &s;tood the nur&s;e's cottage, &s;he directed her &s;teps that
<PB N="48" REF="024442_0173_0FC736458C523878">
way, in order to vi&s;it her little charge whom &s;he had not &s;een for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>She was met at the door by the good woman, who expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t &s;atisfaction on &s;eeing her:&mdash;"I was ju&s;t agoing, Madam," &s;aid &s;he, "to fetch little Sally to vi&s;it your La'&s;hip to day at the Ca|&s;tle, that you might &s;ee what a charming little pup|pet it grows, and how &s;mart and tidy &s;he looks in the new cap your La'&s;hip gave her."&mdash;"I am very happy, nur&s;e," an&s;wered Loui&s;a, "that you are likely to have &s;uch credit by your fo&s;ter; but you mu&s;t never bring her to the Ca&s;tle, as I will often call here to &s;ee her, and always take care that you &s;hall want for nothing."</P>
<P>As &s;he was care&s;&s;ing this beautiful child with much fondne&s;s, a &s;igh e&s;caped her, on recollection of his birth and unfortunate circum&s;tances.&mdash;"I hope, Madam," &s;aid the &s;imple cottager, "your La'|&s;hip does not &s;ee any cau&s;e to find fault with my care of the child? I am &s;ure &s;he &s;ucks all night long, and gets as much victuals as &s;he can eat, and my hu&s;band never has a ra&s;her, without giving her a bit of it; for he loves my little puppet, and our ba|con is pure good, an' plea&s;e your La'&s;hip, and &s;uck|ing a bit makes the child hearty."&mdash;"Indeed, good nur&s;e," replied Loui&s;a, whith a complacent &s;mile, "I am quite &s;atisfied that you do your duty to the &s;weet babe; but I &s;igh to think what a cruel father &s;he has."&mdash;"Lack-a-day, Ma'am," replied nur&s;e, "there be too many &s;uch fathers in the world; but, mayhap, if your La'&s;hip would &s;end and tell him what a fine child he has here, he might return again."</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="024442_0174_0FC73646F7D57118">
Mi&s;s Seymour, on looking at her watch, perceiv|ed that it was very late; &s;he therefore repeated her injunctions to nur&s;e never to bring Sally near the Ca&s;tle; and bidding her a good-morning, returned home.</P>
<P>She found there the Marquis and his daughter, who&s;e company became dearer to her every day: It was with real concern, therefore, &s;he learned, that bu&s;ine&s;s of importance required that the Marquis &s;hould immediately &s;et off for London.

<P>It is now, my dear Henry, that, laying a&s;ide that &s;tandard by which you judged of mankind, and which you found in your own uncorrupted heart, you begin to open your eyes, and to &s;ee them is they really are, in&s;tead of what you wi&s;hed them to be. It is with pain we fir&s;t make this di&s;covery; for the errors of the judgement are always more mortifying to our &s;elf-love, than tho&s;e of the heart.

And when one con&s;iders how difficult it is, e&s;pecially in early life, to re&s;i&s;t the allurements of plea&s;ure, and combat the pleas of indolence, it &s;eems rather &s;urpri&s;ing, that they are not always the &s;laves of vice, than that they are not always the &s;laves of vice, than that they &s;hould &s;ometimes become the dupes of folly.</P>
<P>I would not have you enter the world with an unkind and indi&s;criminating jealou&s;y of your &s;pecies.

<P>Our conviction, my dear friend, in&s;en&s;ibly co|incides with our inclination. You have taught me to believe that my letters give you plea&s;ure: I am too happy in being able to do &s;o, not to embrace every occa&s;ion of addre&s;&s;ing you. The prai&s;es I be|&s;tow on you, my dear Lady Charlotte, are from the heart;&mdash;you are &s;ufficiently acquainted with its ge|nuine language, to give credit to this a&s;&s;ertion; and &s;urely would not wi&s;h me either to di&s;gui&s;e or &s;up|pre&s;s its dictates, when writing to you.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="024442_0183_0FC736646C8B6588">
I cannot agree with you, "that in prai&s;ing you, I am lavi&s;hing encomiums on my&s;elf." You for|get that we always incline to contemn what we al|ready enjoy, and admire what we do not po&s;&s;e&s;s.&mdash;I mu&s;t not, however, be perver&s;e, or attempt to im|po&s;e on you by my &s;ophi&s;try. However this may hold with re&s;pect to the goods of fortune, it does not apply to the gifts of nature. It is confe&s;&s;ed, we are all &s;ufficiently di&s;po&s;ed to over-value our mental qualifications.</P>
<P>Do not be afraid to &s;cold me, whenever you think I require &s;uch di&s;cipline. Though you have heard me confe&s;s, that I would &s;uffer extreme pain on being told my faults by a per&s;on I loved, from the dread of forfeiting their e&s;teem, this is unpar|donable weakne&s;s. What friend expects to find us perfect?&mdash;and who is &s;o proper to correct, &s;o like|ly to reform us, as tho&s;e we love?&mdash;Let me conjure you then, my dear Lady Charlotte, to tell me can|didly whenever you &s;ee me fall into any error, that I may prove, by my eagerne&s;s to amend it, how de|&s;irous I am of becoming all you wi&s;h me to be.</P>
<P>Nothing, I am per&s;uaded, is &s;o fatal, either to the intere&s;ts of love or friend&s;hip, as tho&s;e little di&s;|gu&s;ts which take their ri&s;e from trifles, but which, by alarming the delicacy, and wounding the pride of affection, by being often ren<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">wed, increa&s;e in|&s;en&s;ibly to coldne&s;s, indifference, di&s;like&mdash;nay, aver|&s;ion it&s;elf.

Indeed, if we are at pains to examine our own minds, we &s;hall find, that &s;ecurity of meeting with indulgence, is the fir&s;t thing that prompts to unbounded confi|dence.</P>
<P>We are at pre&s;ent on a vi&s;it at Lord Sali&s;bu|ry's; one of the noble&s;t and mo&s;t exten&s;ive e&s;tates in this country.

<P>I have often thought, my dear Henry, that there is not a more &s;urpri&s;ing principle in the mind
<PB N="60" REF="024442_0185_0FC7366BC07BF278">
of man, than that by which he is led on from day to day, in pur&s;uit of a felicity, which, in the calm hour of reflection, he will acknowledge to be unat|tainable whil&s;t on earth.&mdash;De&s;pi&s;ing the ble&s;&s;ings which the pre&s;ent offers to his enjoyment, he re&s;ts all his hopes upon the future. Yet, alas! what more can he know of the future, than that it will re&s;emble the pa&s;t, which has already deceived, and grievou&s;ly di&s;appointed him?</P>
<P>Mankind, in their eager pur&s;uit after happine&s;s, overlook the means of obtaining it; for this eager|ne&s;s, leaving them no lei&s;ure to form ju&s;t notions con|cerning the nature of their chief good, hurries them into a thou&s;and wild and extravagant &s;chemes, ab|&s;olutely de&s;tructive of it. By &s;uch men, happine&s;s is believed to con&s;i&s;t in a quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of rap|turous enjoyments, where every de&s;ire obtains its completion, and every pur&s;uit is crowned with &s;uc|ce&s;s.</P>
<P>Now, it is evident, that &s;uch felicity is ab&s;o|lutely incompatible with our pre&s;ent &s;tate of di&s;ci|pline, where plenty is the fruit of toil, health the effect of temperance, re&s;t the reward of labour, and plea&s;ure the concomitant of pain; where virtue mu&s;t be tried by adver&s;ity, and the character formed by frequent acts of fortitude and &s;elf-denial.</P>
<P>But, further, mankind err, in affixing to par|ticular &s;ituations and circum&s;tances, the idea of a quality which re&s;ults from the exerci&s;e of worthy and generous affections, and the harmony of a pi|ous and well-regulated mind.</P>
<P>The &s;ame objects do not affect any two of the human &s;pecies exactly in the &s;ame manner.&mdash;The
<PB N="61" REF="024442_0186_0FC7366D397B9768">

<P>Let us try then, by forming ju&s;t notions of our pre&s;ent &s;tate, to determine what mu&s;t con&s;titute our greate&s;t happine&s;s: Let us con&s;ider our&s;elves as placed here, not long to &s;uffer, or exqui&s;itely to enjoy; but by properly maintaining our allotted part, to prepare our&s;elves for future enjoyment.</P>
<P>Objects of high gratification are rare, and dif|ficult to be acquired; and our angui&s;h, when de|prived of them, mu&s;t ever be proportionable to the tran&s;port they have afforded us. Objects of com|placency and &s;atisfaction are always within reach of a benevolent heart and well-regulated mind; and when Providence demands them from us, we can re&s;ign them, without that poignant regret which in|capacitates the &s;oul for the enjoyment of &s;uch as remain.</P>
<P>Let us then endeavour, by habituating our|&s;elves to be &s;atisfied with &s;uch temperate plea&s;ures as are ea&s;ily attained, and &s;uited to our pre&s;ent cir|cum&s;tances, to cultivate that healthful cheerfulne&s;s and equality of temper which di&s;po&s;es us to view the be&s;t &s;ide of life, which gives a ze&s;t to all its in|nocent plea&s;ures, and which we can never know,

whil&s;t, re&s;tle&s;s and un&s;atisfied, we gra&s;p at an ima|ginary bli&s;s, and forfeit &s;ub&s;tantial peace, in vainly &s;triving for exqui&s;ite enjoyment.</P>
<P>You tell me, that "bad health has at times an influence, even on the gentle temper of Dr. Mel|ville." Remember, my dear Ha&s;tings, it is the pe|culiar privilege, as well as province of friend&s;hip, not only to bear with the little &s;allies of pa&s;&s;ion and peevi&s;hne&s;s, to which all of human kind are liable, but, with &s;uperior delicacy, to &s;teal from us our vexations and inquietudes, without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eeming to perceive that they exi&s;t.</P>

<P>The wonderful affection which united the very &s;ouls of the&s;e friends, was allowed, I fear, to exceed the bounds pre&s;cribed by rea&s;on and duty. It was &s;uch a copious and overflowing tide, as laid wa&s;te, or &s;wallowed up in its cour&s;e, many of tho&s;e kind and le&s;&s;er benevolences due to &s;ociety; who&s;e &s;our|ces, perhaps, remained in their hearts, but who&s;e &s;treams were not &s;ufficiently diffu&s;ed through their lives.</P>
<P>The gentle Con&s;tance has fallen a victim to the indulgence of that exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility, &s;o &s;ooth|ing and flattering to young minds, and which a thou&s;and circum&s;tances, in this region of &s;orrows, are ever at hand to cheri&s;h. From the natural de|licacy of her con&s;titution, on which her mind has doubtle&s;s had a powerful influence, her peace, her health, even her life, has been &s;acrificed to this de|lightful, but fatal tenderne&s;s. With this nervou&s;|ne&s;s of &s;oul, it was impo&s;&s;ible for her to ta&s;te of happine&s;s in a world where vice is &s;o prevalent, and
<PB N="65" REF="024442_0190_0FC7367DDB8FE498">
misfortune &s;o irremediable.&mdash;The mi&s;eries of hu|man life were to her an in&s;urmountable ob&s;tacle to the enjoyment of its ble&s;&s;ings: And unle&s;s her friends could have borne to &s;ee her become le&s;s amiable and intere&s;ting, they never could hope to behold her more happy.&mdash;Joined to this endearing weakne&s;s, Con&s;tance po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a temper &s;o re&s;erved, that many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;took for pride what was the effect of diffidence alone. Hence &s;he was le&s;s generally be|loved than many who were her inferiors in every quality, but that unre&s;ervedne&s;s which is as often the effect of a weak and intemperate mind, as of a warm and generous heart.</P>
<P>Such was Con&s;tance! So ill fitted for this world, &s;o de&s;irous of another, &s;hould tho&s;e who loved her, regret her early e&s;cape from this dark region of &s;hadows? And whil&s;t Time, like a &s;ilent thief, is daily pilfering from our little hoard of com|fort, &s;hould we, my Loui&s;a, wi&s;h to linger here, till he has robbed us of all?</P>
<P>It is the natural effect of grief, to unhinge the mind, and render us &s;uper&s;titious: Were I to in|dulge the pre&s;ent &s;ugge&s;tions of mine, I would be|lieve, that I was not long to &s;urvive my friend.&mdash;This, my Loui&s;a, is a &s;oothing, but a very &s;elfi&s;h idea. When I know that my life is the object of your prayers and wi&s;hes, ought not this con&s;idera|tion to give it value in my eyes?&mdash;It &s;hall, my love; and if Heaven is plea&s;ed to prolong it, I will yet indulge the plea&s;ing hope of once more embracing my friend.</P>

<P>I think I told you lately, Loui&s;a, that matri|mony was become epidemical here. They are re|&s;olved not only to have me married, but in love too!&mdash;Was ever any thing &s;o unrea&s;onable?&mdash;My father dined ye&s;terday at the French amba&s;&s;ador's, where he was introduced to the young earl of Lei&s;ter, who is ju&s;t returned from the grand tour; elegant, po|lite, hand&s;ome, rich; and, if I may credit the Mar|quis, he has collected all the improvements, graces, and accompli&s;hments, that ever were acquired by travelling, and brought them home in a bundle, for the good of his countrymen. I hope he will have the charity to be&s;tow &s;ome of them on his fellow|peers, who, if want forms a claim, may &s;urely make large demands on his bounty. Perhaps, in return, they may teach him one &s;cience, of which, with all his acquirements, he may be &s;till ignorant; I mean&mdash;cookery. I have heard a member of par|liament de&s;cant more learnedly on a receipt for a pa&s;ty, than he could have done on the bill of rights; and lately ate a beef-&s;teak dre&s;&s;ed by a peer, which the Grand Monarque's cook needed not to be a&s;ham|ed of. Con&s;idering the &s;hortne&s;s of human life, if a man arrive at perfection in one art, it is all that can rea&s;onably be expected.

<P>My father is gone to the play: I had devoted this whole evening to you; was in the very humour for addre&s;&s;ing you in the &s;tyle you love, &s;erious, &s;ententious, and &s;entimental; when a &s;ervant came to inform me, that Mr. Danvers, a gentleman my father had invited to &s;upper, was in the parlour.</P>
<P>It was but ju&s;t eight&mdash;&s;trangers to each other, the pro&s;pect was di&s;mal.

<P>I participate &s;incerely, my dear Lady Char|lotte, in every thing which contributes to your en|joyment; but cannot envy you the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of plea&s;ures which I never could reli&s;h. Surely Hea|ven has annexed to tho&s;e that are &s;imple and natu|ral, a charm unknown to the votaries of luxury and fal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e refinement.</P>
<P>Friend&s;hip, reflection, devotion, and retire|ment, &s;upply real enjoyment to a temperate mind; but the manners, and, far more, the vices of the world, wear off the keen edge of that delicate &s;en&s;i|bility which is the general organ by which all ex|qui&s;ite plea&s;ure is conveyed to the &s;oul.</P>
<P>It is the misfortune of young women in parti|cular, who are trained in the gay world, to have their native abhorrence of vice in&s;en&s;ibly le&s;&s;ened, by being familiari&s;ed to it, and hearing many things talked of there with ea&s;e, which they ought never to think of, but with horror. In particular, they &s;hould be left in ignorance, both of the licenti|ous manners of men, and the pernicious and libertine principles on which they pretend to vindicate them. To make girls acquainted with &s;uch, is like placing edge-tools in the hands of a child, with which, una|ble to u&s;e them, it will certainly de&s;troy it&s;elf.</P>

Such, in my opinion, ought to be the purity of the female mind, that a virtuous woman would feel her&s;elf criminal, in thinking of what a vicious man will not &s;cruple to act.</P>
<P>But, my dear Lady Charlotte, though I do not &s;hare in your turbulent plea&s;ures, think not that I am without your loved variety. In the cour&s;e of eight weeks, we have vi&s;ited as many neighbouring families, &s;ome of whom would afford &s;ubjects &s;uited exactly to your lively pen. We are at pre&s;ent at Squire Randall's, who, to all his other practices, adds that of phy&s;ic: He compounds an eye-water, in particular, which was never once known to fail, though its qualities are directly oppo&s;ite to Lethe's, as it &s;marts the patient too &s;everely to let him for|get his care.&mdash;It grieves me to &s;ee &s;o many care&s;&s;es and &s;o much white meat, be&s;towed by the good lady on a parcel of &s;en&s;ele&s;s, &s;orry cats. Heaven &s;eems to have endowed all its creatures with a cer|tain portion of affection, which mu&s;t be expended: Some lavi&s;h it on de&s;erving, &s;ome on unworthy ob|jects. A dog, a cat, a man, or a monkey, u&s;ually engro&s;&s;es the hearts of our &s;ex;&mdash;plea&s;ure, intere&s;t, ambition, are the idols to which the other &s;acrifice.

<P>You tell me, "you can have no conception of a heaven, without the &s;ociety of your friends." Perhaps, by the time you have known &s;ome of them ten years, you may alter your opinion.

<P>I &s;hare in your plea&s;ures, my dear Henry, whil&s;t wandering with a tender and reverential me|lancholy, through &s;cenes for ever hallowed by the efforts of genius, valour, and virtue. To tread tho&s;e paths where every foot is cla&s;&s;ic ground, can|not fail to in&s;pire a mind like your's with tho&s;e &s;ub|lime ideas, and &s;olemn reflections, which are akin to tho&s;e exalted &s;pirits we then admire; and which by freely communicating, you give pride, as well as joy, to the heart of your father.</P>
<P>What you tell me of the mi&s;erable fate of Tal|bot, &s;hocks me beyond mea&s;ure. How &s;hort, how &s;hameful has been his career! how guilty, how dreadful its clo&s;e!&mdash;What a melancholy proof does he exhibit of the fatal effects of early and vicious habits.</P>
<P>Though pa&s;&s;ion is a violent and in&s;olent ma&s;ter, it will &s;ometimes relax of its &s;everity; but habit is

an obdurate and relentle&s;s tyrant, that holds the mind en&s;laved in cruel and perpetual bondage.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the unbounded indulgence of criminal propen&s;ities, another cau&s;e has contributed to the ruin of the wretched Talbot. You know his mind, naturally active and inquiring, was early poi&s;oned by the maxims of modern philo&s;ophy and &s;cepti|ci&s;m. Surely men are not aware of the con&s;equen|ces, when they publi&s;h their libertine opinions to the world. They u&s;ually claim the title of moral men; but what can be more immoral than &s;uch conduct? Their metaphy&s;ical &s;ubterfuges, and &s;o|phi&s;tical arguments, are only calculated to lull the voice of con&s;cience, and give &s;cope to every lawle&s;s appetite to tyranni&s;e with impunity. Meanwhile, the unhappy vulgar, deprived alike of ability and lei&s;ure for reflection, and prone to indulge to the &s;ame exce&s;&s;es, implicitly acquie&s;ce in the opinions, and eagerly follow the example of their &s;uperiors.

<P>The bulk of our &s;pecies, my dear Henry, em|ploy them&s;elves not in ab&s;tract &s;peculation, but in concerting &s;chemes of plea&s;ure and emolument: they affix the idea of happine&s;s to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of certain favourite objects, and expect, with impati|ence, the hour that &s;hall en&s;ure their felicity, by the completion of their wi&s;hes: that hour arrives; but alas! it brings only heavine&s;s and di&s;appoint|ment.

<P>How different is the cour&s;e of that man, who&s;e conduct is regulated by true wi&s;dom&mdash;who con&s;i|ders this life in connection with the next&mdash;who moderates his de&s;ires, and pre&s;erves the powers of his mind in equal balance!&mdash;His wi&s;hes can ne|ver be di&s;appointed, becau&s;e the object of them is immutable; his &s;chemes can never be fru&s;trated, becau&s;e they are built on the foundation of truth; and time, which accelerates the de&s;truction of all things mortal, &s;peeds on the hour of his &s;afety, his triumph, his everla&s;ting joy!</P>
<P>We are once more returned to the Ca&s;tle, with that &s;weet &s;atisfaction which home affords to tho&s;e who are happy in their dome&s;tic connections, and endowed by Heaven with the true reli&s;h for happine&s;s.</P>

She is truly a mo&s;t amiable and intelli|gent young creature, and almo&s;t tempts me to di&s;|pute our &s;ex's claim to &s;uperior judgment and abi|lities.</P>
<P>For my part, the more I know of the world, the more equality I di&s;cover between the &s;exes; and it mu&s;t be allowed the other have this in their favour, that with hearts more &s;u&s;ceptible, and judg|ments le&s;s informed, they are often able, through the &s;trength of principle alone, to re&s;i&s;t and con|quer tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, to which we give unbounded licence, in &s;pite of that &s;uperior &s;trength of mind, by which we pretend to be di&s;tingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>The characteri&s;tics of the two &s;exes are widely different:&mdash;to ours belong the bold, hardy active
<PB N="78" REF="024442_0203_0FC736A5A2A98CE8">
virtues; to theirs the patient, gentle, amiable gra|ces.&mdash;How ab&s;urd is it then to draw compari&s;ons between the two, when the comparative excellence of each mu&s;t depend on their di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">militude?</P>
<P>The female heart, my dear Henry, is naturally tender and un&s;u&s;picious; and before mixing with the world, ignorance of its manners, vanity, or &s;elf|love, often leads young women to con&s;true into marks of a particular preference, tho&s;e little atten|tions and gallantries, which re&s;ult from complacen|cy and good breeding alone.&mdash;Let me advi&s;e you, when in company with the other &s;ex, to avoid too minute complai&s;ance&mdash;to wrap your&s;elf up in your natural re&s;erve, and rather to appear le&s;s amiable, that you may prove more truly e&s;timable.&mdash;Won|der not at this advice; it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lows from ob&s;ervation and long acquaintance with life. You can hardly con|ceive the di&s;tre&s;s in which many women have been involved by the vanity and incon&s;ideratene&s;s of men&mdash;of men too, who would &s;hrink with h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rror from the idea of cruelty, at the very in&s;tant, when, by their mi&s;leading and too pointed attentions, they are laying the foundation of mi&s;ery in tho&s;e gentle bo|&s;oms, who&s;e mo&s;t ardent wi&s;h is their happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Your ob&s;ervation is certainly ju&s;t;&mdash;our pa&s;|&s;ions are always &s;uperficial in their inquiries, and impetuous in their &s;allies. Rea&s;on, on the contrary, is accurate and &s;low. Hence the former often mi&s;|lead the mind, before the latter arrives to direct it in the right path.&mdash;Mi&s;erable &s;tate of man! ex|claims the caviller: How u&s;ele&s;s that boa&s;ted facul|ty!&mdash;too tardy to oppo&s;e our impul&s;es, it comes but to upbraid us for yielding to them.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="024442_0204_0FC736A707C24C30">
Such complaints, however, are as ill-founded as they are peevi&s;h.&mdash;Omni&s;cience has a&s;&s;igned us another co-adjutor in the ta&s;k of &s;elf-government&mdash;con&s;cience&mdash;which remon&s;trates again&s;t every vici|ous tendency, with a promptitude which equals thought in quickne&s;s. Let us &s;ubmit, then, to the tuition of this faithful in&s;tructor. He is the Al|mighty's delegate, and therefore his dictates mu&s;t be right. Mankind may indeed wre&s;t his language to guilty purpo&s;es; but this does not di&s;parage him; on the contrary, it is an evidence of his integrity; for if his obvious meaning were not reprehen&s;ive of their vices, they would hardly be at &s;o much pains to mi&s;interpret his &s;peech.</P>
<P>May we, my &s;on, ever li&s;ten attentively to his gentle&s;t remon&s;trances; and act &s;uch a part now as &s;hall &s;ecure his future approbation.&mdash;Adieu.</P>

<P>My Loui&s;a will undoubtedly be anxious to know &s;omething more than common report, of a man who already intere&s;ts the heart of her friend, and who di&s;tingui&s;hes me by a preference equally obvious and flattering.</P>
<P>Lord Lei&s;ter di&s;covers, on every occa&s;ion, a &s;ound judgment and a correct ta&s;te;&mdash;a delicate &s;en&s;e of propriety, a con&s;tant, not too eager de&s;ire to oblige, ari&s;ing from a wi&s;h to make others happy, rather than to be di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf; a refined humanity, a ju&s;t di&s;cernment, and, above all, a mo|de&s;ty

&s;o engaging and una&s;&s;uming, as adds a lu&s;tre to his other good qualities.&mdash;The&s;e I have already had opportunity to di&s;criminate; and, you may be|lieve, am inclined to give him credit for at lea&s;t a hundred more.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t we were &s;itting ye&s;terday on one of the benches in the Park, a genteel young woman, who&s;e countenance expre&s;&s;ed the deepe&s;t &s;orrow, approached, with a little child in her hand, who &s;eemed extremely fatigued; but on &s;eeing the bench occupied, was about to retire.&mdash;To the unfortunate, more than ordinary attention is due.&mdash;I begged her to &s;it down, and Lord Lei&s;ter, with great humani|ty, took the &s;weet little boy on his knee. Good-manners prevented me from a&s;king any que&s;tions of the afflicted lady, who&s;e &s;pirits &s;eemed &s;o de|pre&s;&s;ed, that it was with difficulty &s;he could re&s;train her tears. In a few minutes the child got up, and, taking hold of her hand, <Q>Come, mama, &s;aid he, in a cheerful tone, I am able to walk now&mdash;let us go home to poor papa.</Q> She ro&s;e to thank me; but on attempting to &s;peak, the angui&s;h of her heart denied her utterance, and &s;he bur&s;t into a flood of tears.&mdash;I begged to know the cau&s;e of her extreme agitation, and a&s;&s;ured her I &s;hould feel my&s;elf hap|py in the power either to a&s;&s;i&s;t or relieve her.</P>
<P>She told me, that &s;he was niece to Lord&mdash;;whom, by marrying an officer of family, but no fortune, &s;he had for ever di&s;obliged: That her hu&s;|band, who&s;e name was Williams, having received a wound in his brea&s;t, which entirely ruined his health, was obliged to return to England, where he had langui&s;hed in all the mi&s;ery which neglect, po|verty, and di&s;ea&s;e can inflict on a noble and inge|nuous
<PB N="81" REF="024442_0206_0FC736B14E7EC508">
&s;pirit: That &s;he had made many applicati|ons to her uncle, and their other great friends, or rather relations, who had not only refu&s;ed them a&s;|&s;i&s;tance, but, by in&s;olence and contempt, had em|bittered all their &s;ufferings!</P>
<P>Gracious Heaven! is it not enough to make the noble mind feel the whole weight of dependence, by being forced, with &s;hame, to implore that relief which ought to be voluntarily be&s;towed? Mu&s;t the breaking heart be torn with unkindne&s;s? Mu&s;t un|merited contempt and reproach render the cup of grief, and the bread of mi&s;ery, &s;till more bitter?&mdash;Is it really then, in the eyes of this generation, a crime to be poor?&mdash;Surely, to revile the unfortu|nate, is to reproach that Being by whom the lot of every creature is di&s;po&s;ed!</P>
<P>We accompanied Mrs. Williams to the entry of Spring-garden, where my carriage waited. On handing me in, Lord Lei&s;ter begged me to &s;top a few minutes, whil&s;t, with an attentive humanity worthy of him&s;elf, he carried Mrs. Williams and her &s;on into the neighbouring coffee-hou&s;e, and pro|cured them &s;ome refre&s;hment. We then &s;et them down near Golden-&s;quare, where Lord Lei&s;ter a&s;|&s;ured her, he would &s;oon wait on Captain Willi|ams.</P>
<P>It is alledged, that pro&s;perity renders us care|le&s;s of the happine&s;s of our fellow-creatures. For my part, Loui&s;a, I have ever felt my concern for the welfare of others, bear a proportion to my own felicity. Nor is this wonderful: Con&s;cious that, for wi&s;e ends, Heaven hath &s;o con&s;tituted mankind, that they cannot &s;o cordially &s;ympathi&s;e in our joys
<PB N="82" REF="024442_0207_0FC736B299A72380">
as our &s;orrows, we are afraid to forfeit the benevo|lent regards of our &s;pecies, by appearing to triumph in that pro&s;perity, which places us beyond the reach of their good offices. Hence the &s;trong propen&s;ity we feel, to aggravate the account of our di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and to touch lightly on tho&s;e peculiar marks of good fortune, by which we may be di&s;tingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>You once told me, that to receive obligations, gave you pain; which you attributed to the pride of your heart. Favours and obligations, my dear Loui&s;a, are terms unknown to real friend&s;hip. To be&s;tow a favour on a friend, is to confer happine&s;s on one's &s;elf; and to receive an obligation, is in &s;ome mea&s;ure to repay it, by &s;upplying one's friend with an opportunity of ta&s;ting the mo&s;t refined plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>But though I re&s;pect too highly every feeling of your heart, ever willingly to do violence to any of them, it &s;urely cannot give you pain to accept of a very &s;mall gift from one, who is ambitious of a very large &s;hare of your e&s;teem; and who means not this trifle as expre&s;&s;ive of her regard, but of her earne&s;t de&s;ire of being &s;ometimes remembered by you while at a di&s;tance&mdash;But &s;hould I indeed of|f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nd you by my pre&s;ent, in your indulgence I will tru&s;t for my pardon.

<P>For my part, Lord Lei&s;ter &s;hall have my yea and amen, to take Lady Charlotte Villiers, for bet|ter, for wor&s;e, as &s;oon as he plea&s;es. She has long been a trouble&s;ome and vexatious companion to me;

<P>Whil&s;t Mi&s;s Seymour was amu&s;ing her&s;elf with her friend's letter in the pavilion, a &s;ervant ha&s;tily entered, and informed her, that Lord Granville was &s;uddenly taken ill, and his lady begged to &s;ee her immediately in his apartment.&mdash;Loui&s;a entered the room in great agitation, and was dreadfully alarmed, on &s;eeing Lord Granville, pale and faint, &s;upported in the arms of his afflicted wife, who&s;e countenance &s;ufficiently expre&s;&s;ed the terror and angui&s;h of her mind. He had complained of &s;ick|ne&s;s, whil&s;t reading to her in the library, and im|mediately on reaching his apartment, fainted away. After being put to bed, Lady Granville retired a
<PB N="93" REF="024442_0218_0FC73296D52EAF08">
few minutes to give vent to tho&s;e tears which &s;he could no longer re&s;train, and left Loui&s;a &s;itting by the bed-&s;ide. No &s;ooner was &s;he gone, than Lord Granville, opening the curtain, made a motion for Loui&s;a to approach: She did &s;o; when, taking hold of her hand, which he tenderly pre&s;&s;ed be|tween his, "My dear Mi&s;s Seymour," &s;aid he, this is no time for ceremony or di&s;gui&s;e&mdash;Lady Granville's di&s;tre&s;s overwhelms me; I cannot bear to add to her affliction, by telling her the truth. You mu&s;t be to her a daughter;&mdash;believe me, ami|able Loui&s;a, I have long loved you as &s;uch.&mdash;I have &s;een the growing tenderne&s;s of Ha&s;tings, and I have &s;een it with plea&s;ure;&mdash;you are worthy of each other. When he returns to &s;olicit your hand, let him be a&s;&s;ured, that his choice met with my warm|e&s;t approbation."</P>
<P>The variety of &s;trong and conflicting pa&s;&s;ions which this di&s;cour&s;e awakened in the bo&s;om of Loui&s;a, deprived her for &s;ome time of the power of utterance. She knelt by the bed, and, taking Lord Granville's hand, which &s;he ki&s;&s;ed and bathed with her tears, "Live, oh live, my Lord," cried &s;he, "to witne&s;s and confirm that happine&s;s you have &s;o generou&s;ly be&s;towed!"</P>
<P>This tender &s;cene was interrupted by the entrance of Lady Granville, which left Loui&s;a at liberty to retire, and compo&s;e the perturbation of her mind.</P>
<P>The angui&s;h of &s;u&s;pen&s;e was not added to the exqui&s;ite &s;orrow of Lady Granville: Her hu&s;band was &s;eized with another fit; from which he only recovered &s;o far, as to pray for ble&s;&s;ings on her and his &s;on, and take a la&s;t tender farewel. He then,
<PB N="94" REF="024442_0219_0FC7329B4896E210">
with equal fortitude and re&s;ignation, prepared to meet his fate; which &s;oon &s;ucceeded, and deprived his family and &s;ociety of a life un&s;peakably dear to the one, and highly valuable to the other.</P>
<P>Providence has wi&s;ely con&s;tituted us in &s;uch a manner, that the nece&s;&s;ary exertion of the mind, in times of di&s;tre&s;s, &s;eems to &s;upport the feeblene&s;s of the body;&mdash;but when the attention of the former is no longer engaged, the powers of the latter feel utterly exhau&s;ted.&mdash;Thus it fared with Lady Gran|ville. All the compa&s;&s;ionate tenderne&s;s and &s;ym|pathy of Loui&s;a, were unable to &s;upport her under the weight of this unexpected and dreadful blow. She &s;unk for a while into the mo&s;t deplorable me|lancholy; from which &s;he was only rou&s;ed by the mo&s;t painful apprehen&s;ions on account of her &s;on, whom di&s;ordered imagination repre&s;ented as involv|ed in dangers, langui&s;hing in &s;ickne&s;s, or &s;inking under the &s;troke of death.</P>
<P>To a mind thus debilitated, it was in vain to offer either the &s;ugge&s;tions of rea&s;on, or the con&s;olations of religion. Loui&s;a contented her&s;elf with te&s;tify|ing the &s;ilent &s;orrow and kind unremitting attenti|ons of friend&s;hip.&mdash;Alas! how feeble is rea&s;on, oppo&s;ed to feeling? Neither the conviction of the under&s;tanding, nor the a&s;&s;ent of the will to the wi&s;|dom and rectitude of the Divine di&s;pen&s;ations, can, for &s;ome time, calm the re&s;tle&s;s de&s;ires of the heart, &s;ecure its peace, or re&s;tore it when lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Hara&s;&s;ed perpetually with images of horror, and di&s;po&s;ed to lean for &s;upport on her la&s;t remaining prop, Lady Granville felt, that without the pre&s;ence of her &s;on, &s;he could never enjoy one moment's

quiet. She therefore wrote, to acquaint him with his misfortune, and entreated his immediate return, that his tenderne&s;s might at lea&s;t alleviate the afflic|tion which his pre&s;ence alone could enable her to &s;upport.</P>
<P>The letter found him at Rome. He he&s;itated not a moment about complying with her reque&s;t; but, in the mean time, di&s;patched the following bil|let, to inform her of his health and &s;afety, and a&s;|&s;ure her of that re&s;pect and affection which, he was con&s;cious, became doubly due to a parent in her &s;ituation.</P>

<P>At length, my beloved, my admirable friend, your &s;ingular and &s;uperior virtues are going to meet with their ju&s;t reward: The amiable Ha&s;tings has this moment left me. He acquainted me with the death of his father; and, whil&s;t he expatiated on his worth and tender affection, the tear of filial piety and &s;orrow trembled in his eye, and for|ced its way down his manly cheek.</P>
<P>Why, my friend, &s;hould men blu&s;h to betray marks of that &s;en&s;ibility they &s;o greatly admire in our &s;ex?&mdash;However modelled by education, or re&s;trained by cu&s;tom, are not the leading features of the human mind the &s;ame in all the human &s;pecies?&mdash;Let others applaud that &s;toical firmne&s;s, for which men are more frequently indebted to con|&s;titution than philo&s;ophy; I &s;hall always think his

<P>Whil&s;t you read this letter, my deare&s;t Loui&s;a, I &s;ee your delicacies all in arms, and your heart throbbing with apprehen&s;ion; but what, my friend, had you to fear from your Adelaide? Does not this heart re&s;pect every tender emotion of your's? Am not I capable of guarding the mo&s;t &s;acred of all de|po&s;its, the honour, the delicacy of a friend? Believe me, your's is not more &s;afe in your own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion than in mine.</P>
<P>All the happine&s;s I can now enjoy mu&s;t be de|rived from that of my friends: your's, I tru&s;t will &s;oon be complete: I would pray that it might be la&s;ting, but correct the vain pre&s;umptuous wi&s;h, and re&s;ign the di&s;po&s;al of your lot and my own, to that wi&s;dom which cannot err.</P>

The day after receiving this letter, Loui&s;a aro&s;e very early, and &s;trove to attain &s;ufficient compo&s;ure to meet Lord Ha&s;tings, without betraying any of tho&s;e violent emotions, with which her heart throb|bed the moment &s;he thought of &s;eeing him. Tho' &s;he &s;at in the &s;ame room with Lady Granville, ab|&s;ent and &s;ilent, &s;he &s;tarted at every little noi&s;e, and &s;eemed perplexed how to an&s;wer the &s;imple&s;t que&s;|tion. The moment &s;he heard a chai&s;e drive into the yard, her heart took the alarm, and &s;he grew &s;o faint, that &s;he was obliged to retire into Lady Granville's dre&s;&s;ing-room. She heard Lord Ha&s;t|ings enter the apartment &s;he had ju&s;t quitted, and forgot her own feelings, to &s;ympathi&s;e in tho&s;e of the friends &s;he loved.</P>
<P>Though Lady Granville had &s;ummoned her ut|mo&s;t fortitude to her aid, &s;he could not again behold her &s;on, without &s;inking almo&s;t under the violence of the different pa&s;&s;ions with which &s;he was agitat|ed.&mdash;His &s;oothing tenderne&s;s at length compo&s;ed her &s;pirits; and, after the fir&s;t violence of their grief was abated, Lady Granville de&s;ired her &s;on to go and fetch Loui&s;a.

<P>My heart feels, and gratefully acknowledges, the &s;hare you take in my &s;orrow, on account of the lo&s;s of the worthie&s;t of friends, and mo&s;t indulgent of fathers. I have hardly yet had lei&s;ure to feel the weight of my misfortune: My affectionate and afflicted mother demands my con&s;tant care. But oh, Beaufort! when I retire to my apartment, and recall the idea of my revered parent, a crowd of tender recollections pre&s;s on my &s;oul, and almo&s;t overwhelm it with &s;orrow!&mdash;Be it our care who &s;urvive, by treading in his &s;teps, to repair, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the injury &s;ociety has &s;u&s;tained, by the lo&s;s of &s;o re&s;pectable and valuable a member.</P>
<P>I found my mother in a very weak &s;tate of health and &s;pirits. Loui&s;a, the amiable, the en|chanting Loui&s;a, is, if po&s;&s;ible, more beautiful, more engaging than ever. That air of &s;ober &s;adne&s;s which the late melancholy incident has impre&s;&s;ed on her features, gives them an expre&s;&s;ion of tenderne&s;s which melts the very &s;oul. Mine is &s;till held in painful &s;u&s;pen&s;e; &s;till am I tortured with tho&s;e perplexing doubts and fears, to which it gives ri&s;e.</P>
<P>Sometimes I fondly flatter my&s;elf, that through the timid and mode&s;t re&s;erve of the mo&s;t amiable of women, I can &s;ee &s;ome &s;parks of that peculiar tenderne&s;s, with which I ardently wi&s;h to in&s;pire her. O, Beaufort! at the&s;e moments, my heart throbs with unutterable tran&s;port!&mdash;At other times there is a caution, a timidity, a re&s;traint in her man|ner, that bla&s;ts every bud of hope, and overwhelms me with dejecting melancholy!</P>
<P>A thou&s;and times a-day, I re&s;olve to &s;peak my &s;entiments to Loui&s;a, and, if po&s;&s;ible, di&s;cover her's.

But the fear of offending, the dread of di&s;gu&s;ting, the apprehen&s;ion of lo&s;ing her friend&s;hip by &s;olicit|ing her love, &s;till withholds me.</P>
<P>I met with an incident to-day which has &s;trange|ly perplexed me. On riding &s;lowly down the lane that leads to the Ca&s;tle, I &s;aw a clean, decent look|ing woman, &s;tanding at the door of a cottage, with an infant in her arms, who&s;e features &s;o &s;trongly re&s;embled the unhappy Talbot, that I had the curio|&s;ity to &s;top my hor&s;e, and inquire to whom the child belonged. The woman looked &s;urpri&s;ed at the que&s;tion, and, upon my repeating it, "Indeed, plea&s;e your honour," &s;aid &s;he, "that is more than I can tell; but I'm &s;ure, whoever my little Sally belongs to, need not be a&s;hamed to own her, for your honour will not &s;ee a &s;touter child in a &s;um|mer's day; but for that matter, &s;he is cared for by the be&s;t gentry in all the country, though I &s;ay it that &s;hould not."&mdash;My fir&s;t &s;u&s;picion was now con|firmed; but what was my a&s;toni&s;hment, when &s;he thus proceeded: "Mayhap, your honour is going to the Ca&s;tle?&mdash;If &s;o, you will &s;ee there the be&s;t friend my poor baby has in this world."&mdash;"How, nur&s;e," demanded I, "is it Lady Granville that befriends your child &s;o much?"&mdash;"No, no, Sir," replied &s;he; "I believe as how Lady Granville is a very good lady, and very kind to the poor; but it is young Mi&s;s Seymour, an' plea&s;e you, that is &s;o kind to me and my &s;weet little poppet."&mdash;The arrival of her hu&s;band, and &s;ome go&s;&s;ips, put an end to this curious dialogue.</P>
<P>To find a child of Talbot's here, de&s;erted and di&s;owned, is by no means &s;urpri&s;ing; but how Mi&s;s Seymour &s;hould be particularly intere&s;ted in the
<PB N="106" REF="024442_0231_0FC732BF77D74DA8">
care of &s;uch a child, is an enigma I cannot unrid|dle.&mdash;I fancy, however, upon further acquaintance, I may prevail on hone&s;t nur&s;e to &s;peak out. If &s;he is enjoined &s;ecrecy, I &s;hould dete&s;t my&s;elf, could I bribe her to betray her tru&s;t; but if prudence alone occa&s;ions her caution, that watchful dame may be caught napping, and nur&s;e open her lips at the &s;ight of all-prevailing gold.&mdash;Adieu.</P>

<HEAD>To Mi&s;s Seymour.</HEAD>
<P>It is with much truth I have formerly affirmed, that when we con&s;ider the &s;hortne&s;s of human life, Loui&s;a, re&s;ignation &s;carce &s;eems a virtue. In&s;tead of looking back with criminal and unavailing &s;or|row, on account of tho&s;e gone before us, we ought to look forward and rejoice, becau&s;e we are &s;o &s;oon to follow.&mdash;Yet a few years, and the &s;orrowful &s;hall re&s;t in &s;ilence with them they deplore;&mdash;yet a few years, and all the griefs, and cares, and inquietudes, that di&s;turb the &s;hort hour of life, and poi&s;on its enjoyments, &s;hall be as nothing!</P>
<P>Again they have brought me here, to try the effects of my native air, in re&s;toring an exhau&s;ted and feeble con&s;titution. But my di&s;ea&s;e is &s;eated in my heart, and is without remedy!</P>
<P>Let not this afflict my gentle friend; let it ra|ther bring her comfort to hear, that the hour of my relea&s;e is fa&s;t approaching, and that I am about to receive my reward, before bearing the burden and

heat of the day.&mdash;We have been long &s;eparated from each other: Where is the difference, Loui&s;a, whether we are divided by &s;eas and mountains&mdash;or by the grave?&mdash;Yes, my loved friend, there is a great, an e&s;&s;ential difference&mdash;Whil&s;t &s;eparated by di&s;tance, we are continually hara&s;&s;ed with fear and anxiety, on account of each other; but no &s;ooner does the grave receive tho&s;e we love, than all our re&s;tle&s;s inquietudes end.</P>
<P>In proportion as earth and its concerns recede from view, the grand, the &s;olemn &s;cenes on which we are about to enter, come forward to cheer and &s;upport the mind under the decays of nature. Let the&s;e have due influence on your's, &s;hould Heaven &s;ee good to remove from you the friend you have long loved; and having improved to our advance|ment in piety and virtue on earth, the mo&s;t tender and la&s;ting attachment, let us confide in our bene|ficent Creator, that he will admit us to perfect, in the &s;ociety of the ble&s;&s;ed, a friend&s;hip which here is liable to be impaired, may be interrupted, and mu&s;t one day &s;uffer di&s;&s;olution.</P>
<P>We are all prone, Loui&s;a, to forget our pre&s;ent is a &s;tate of di&s;cipline, and regard the ble&s;&s;ings we po&s;&s;e&s;s, not as the gifts of a bountiful Benefactor, which he is at liberty to re&s;ume at plea&s;ure, but as an inheritance to which we have an indefea&s;ible right. It is nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould frequently be reminded of our ab&s;olute dependence on God, and be brought back to him, by feeling that all be&s;ides is vain, un&s;atisfying, and evane&s;cent.</P>
<P>No one can properly a&s;&s;ent to this truth, that has never lo&s;t a friend. That &s;troke, which loo&s;ens our deare&s;t tie to earth, forms al&s;o, as it were, new

</LETTER>
<P>The grief this letter occa&s;ioned in the gentle heart of Loui&s;a was too great not to make a corre&s;pond|ent impre&s;&s;ion on her features. This was immedi|ately di&s;covered by Lord Ha&s;tings, who anxiou&s;ly inquired the cau&s;e; and, by the lively intere&s;t he took in her &s;orrow, in&s;en&s;ibly le&s;&s;ened its violence. It &s;upplied him al&s;o with many pretences for con|ver&s;ing with Loui&s;a alone (who wi&s;hed to conceal every depre&s;&s;ing circum&s;tance from Lady Granville) and gave room for &s;uch melting expre&s;&s;ions of pity, as bore a near re&s;emblance to expre&s;&s;ions of love.</P>
<P>One morning, after a very re&s;tle&s;s night, Lady Granville, feeling her&s;elf drow&s;y, de&s;ired Lord Ha&s;|tings to ride out, as the weather was remarkably <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ine, and leave her to the care of Loui&s;a, "who, I know," &s;aid &s;he, with a look of complacency, "prefers my ea&s;e to her own, and will kindly read me to &s;leep." This propo&s;al was readily embraced by Mi&s;s Seymour; but Lord Ha&s;tings expre&s;&s;ed great reluctance to leaving his mother. In reality, though there never was a more attentive or affec|tionate &s;on, the pre&s;ence and conver&s;ation of Mi&s;s Seymour were now become &s;o e&s;&s;ential to his en|joyment, that he could find no plea&s;ure in any amu&s;ement in which &s;he did not partake.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="024442_0234_0FC732CC0B347820">
He was &s;carcely gone, when Lady Granville ex|pre&s;&s;ed great anxiety to know what hor&s;e he rode; and on being informed that it was one he had late|ly purcha&s;ed, grew extremely unea&s;y, telling Loui|&s;a, that though he had carefully concealed it from her, &s;he had learnt, by accident, that this new fa|vourite was very ea&s;ily &s;tartled, and had actually thrown Lord Ha&s;tings &s;ome time ago. Loui&s;a &s;aid every thing to quiet the fears of his anxious mother, and continued to read, till &s;he perceived &s;he had dropped a&s;leep. Her apprehen&s;ions were not &s;o ea&s;ily lulled: She &s;tole &s;oftly down to the garden, and, cro&s;&s;ing a &s;mall paddock adjoining to it, walk|ed &s;lowly up the lane, from whence &s;he had a view of the high road. She had not continued her walk many minutes, when &s;he di&s;covered two men on hor&s;eback at a di&s;tance; and &s;uppo&s;ing them to be Lord Ha&s;tings and his &s;ervant, turned ha&s;tily back, to regain the paddock before he &s;hould ob&s;erve her. It was too late, however, to effect her purpo&s;e;&mdash;on entering the lane, Lord Ha&s;tings in&s;tantly di&s;|covered her; and alarmed on &s;eeing her there alone, without her hat and cloak, clapped &s;purs to his hor&s;e, and reached the paddock at the very moment &s;he arrived there. The flutter of her &s;pirits gave &s;uch a tremor to her hand, that &s;he made a con&s;i|derable noi&s;e in opening the gate; which &s;tartling the hor&s;e, made him &s;pring to the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the road&mdash;and, in attempting to &s;ave him&s;elf from falling, Lord Ha&s;tings &s;prained his arm in &s;o vio|lent a manner, that it was with difficulty he could di&s;mount.</P>
<P>After charging the &s;ervant to take no notice of this accident at the Ca&s;tle, and &s;ending him away with the hor&s;es, he followed Loui&s;a into the pad|dock,
<PB N="110" REF="024442_0235_0FC732CD79DFBC20">
who &s;tood pale and trembling, &s;upporting her&s;elf again&s;t a tree.&mdash;She eagerly inquired after his arm, and expre&s;&s;ed the &s;incere&s;t regret, on ac|count of having been the cau&s;e of his accident:&mdash;"For Heaven's &s;ake, my Lord," &s;aid &s;he, "let me entreat you never again to mount that hor&s;e, which has already almo&s;t co&s;t you your life."&mdash;Taking hold of her hand, which he ki&s;&s;ed with a look of grateful acknowledgment, he expre&s;&s;ed much &s;ur|pri&s;e at her knowledge of the circum&s;tance of his former danger, as well as at her walking in the lane in that dre&s;s, without any attendant. In a moment, her face and neck were covered with blu&s;hes: The impropriety of this circum&s;tance, which &s;trongly betrayed the anxious and di&s;turbed &s;tate of her mind, had never once occurred to her. She pau&s;|ed&mdash;&s;he he&s;itated&mdash;and was utterly at a lo&s;s how to reply. Lord Ha&s;tings perceived her embarra&s;&s;ment; and, pre&s;&s;ing her hand to his throbbing bo&s;om,&mdash;"Why&mdash;why, deare&s;t Mi&s;s Seymour," &s;aid he, with a look that pierced her to the &s;oul, "&s;hould you be &s;o concerned about pre&s;erving a life which is of &s;o little value to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or?"&mdash;"Surely, my Lord," replied &s;he, "you cannot mean what you &s;ay? You mu&s;t know that your life is of value to all who&mdash;" The earne&s;tne&s;s with which Lord Ha&s;tings gazed on Loui&s;a whil&s;t &s;he &s;poke, &s;o great|ly di&s;concerted her, that &s;he &s;topped &s;hort, afraid that &s;he had already &s;aid too much. "Ah, Mi&s;s Seymour," &s;aid he, in a tender and &s;oftened voice, "could I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">latter my&s;elf that my life was of con&s;e|quence to <HI>one,</HI> I would then know how much to va|lue it."&mdash;Loui&s;a's perplexity and confu&s;ion increa|&s;ed &s;o much, that &s;he turned towards the hou&s;e, and muttering &s;omething about Lady Granville being alone, left Lord Ha&s;tings, without knowing what &s;he did.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="024442_0236_0FC732D52683B9D8">
He &s;tood &s;ome minutes, fixed to the &s;pot: He repeated every word Loui&s;a had uttered&mdash;he re|flected on the circum&s;tance of her walking out alone towards the road, after having heard of his danger&mdash;and above all, on the tender &s;olicitude &s;he &s;hewed for his &s;afety; and then wondered at his own blindne&s;s to &s;o many proofs of her preference&mdash;and pre&s;ently reflecting on her former in&s;en&s;ibi|lity to &s;o many marks of his, on the letter of Grammont, and con&s;equent depre&s;&s;ion of her &s;pi|rits, with that diffidence which ever accompanies genuine and re&s;pectful love&mdash;he attributed all that had pa&s;&s;ed, to the gentle and compa&s;&s;ionate tem|per of Loui&s;a, who&s;e heart, he &s;till feared, was in|&s;en&s;ible to the ardent affection of his.</P>
<P>He had bewildered him&s;elf &s;o long with the&s;e various conjectures, that he appeared quite ab&s;ent on entering Lady Granville's apartment; who, without knowing what had pa&s;&s;ed, conjured him never again to ride the hor&s;e above-mentioned, and added, "though you kindly concealed the accident from me, I was telling Loui&s;a, ju&s;t after you left us, that I was not ignorant of the danger you had in|curred, by riding this unruly favourite of your's." Lord Ha&s;tings turned his eyes on Loui&s;a, who was overwhelmed with confu&s;ion at this unexpected piece of information; and which was rather in|crea&s;ed by his replying, "I &s;hould indeed be the mo&s;t ungrateful of human beings, could I knowing|ly give one moment's pain to tho&s;e who &s;o kindly intere&s;t them&s;elves in my &s;afety."</P>
<P>As it was evident Mi&s;s Seymour had made no mention of his late accident, he cho&s;e likewi&s;e to be &s;ilent on the &s;ubject. A thou&s;and little attentive
<PB N="112" REF="024442_0237_0FC732D7D599A9C0">
cares on the part of Loui&s;a, &s;hewed that it had made a deep impre&s;&s;ion on her mind. The pain he felt from the arm, which, for &s;everal days, he could not u&s;e, it was not always in his power to conceal; and the re&s;traint impo&s;ed on Loui&s;a, by the pre&s;ence of Lady Granville, only redoubled the earne&s;tne&s;s of her inquiries, and tenderne&s;s of her &s;ympathy, when, for a moment, &s;he found an opportunity of &s;eeing him alone.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation of two amiable young people, in whom her heart took the mo&s;t tender intere&s;t, in&s;en&s;ibly di&s;&s;ipated the gloom, with which the death of Lord Granville at fir&s;t overwhelmed his affectionate wife: And thought Lord Ha&s;tings re|ceived, with exqui&s;ite delight, the unguarded expre&s;|&s;ions of compa&s;&s;ion, under which were concealed the tender, artle&s;s effu&s;ions of love, he did not chu&s;e, by too animated returns of gratitude for her kind|ne&s;s, to alarm the delicacy of Loui&s;a, or increa&s;e her caution with re&s;pect to tho&s;e enchanting proofs of her tenderne&s;s, of which his glowing heart felt the full value.</P>
<P>One day Lady Granville propo&s;ed trying to walk in the garden, for the benefit of air and exerci&s;e. This, with the help of Loui&s;a and her &s;on, &s;he ac|compli&s;hed with tolerable ea&s;e; and, after having re&s;ted &s;ome time in the pavilion, felt her &s;pirits &s;o revived with the beautiful &s;cene around her, that &s;he wandered down the field at the bottom of the garde. Ju&s;t as they had &s;eated them&s;elves on the bench, they ob&s;erved a woman, with a lovely in|fant in her arms, both remarkably clean, pa&s;&s;ing through the field; who, on &s;eeing them, quickened her pace, as if afraid of being challenged. Lady
<PB N="113" REF="024442_0238_0FC732D8C942FCA8">
Granville, who was extremely fond of children, called her: The poor woman approached; and, on &s;eeing Mi&s;s Seymour, looked extremely di&s;con|certed. "I humbly beg your La'&s;hip's pardon," &s;aid &s;he (addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to Loui&s;a, without mind|ing Lady Granville, who was wholly engaged ad|miring the beauty of the child;) I confe&s;s I ought not to have pre&s;umed for to come &s;o near the Ca|&s;tle, after your La'&s;hip's expre&s;s orders to the con|trary; but this being a holiday at Farmer Gibbon's, we were all go&s;&s;ipping there, and I waited to try and bring my hu&s;band along with me; for John, poor man, does like Farmer Gibbon's ale with all his heart, that he does. An' &s;o, plea&s;e your La'|&s;hip, being rather late abroad with my little Sally, I was taking the neare&s;t way home; but if your La'&s;hip is angry with me, I will never do &s;o no more."</P>
<P>During this harangue, the little infant, ca&s;ting its eyes on Loui&s;a, &s;creamed with joy, and &s;tretched out its arms to embrace her, which greatly increa&s;|ed her confu&s;ion. "I prote&s;t, Madam," &s;aid nur&s;e, with tears of joy in her eyes, "the little hu&s;&s;ey knows your La'&s;hip; but no wonder."&mdash;Lord Ha&s;tings took the child from her, to reach it to Loui&s;a, and, ki&s;&s;ing it, placed it on his knee: I fear, nur&s;e," &s;aid he, "I &s;hall make but an awkward figure; but if I am not mi&s;taken, here is a lady," turning to Loui&s;a, "better accu&s;tomed to the office."&mdash;The infant cla&s;ped her round the neck; and though its inno|cent care&s;&s;es, at any other time, would have given her delight, at pre&s;ent they only heightened her blu&s;hes, and increa&s;ed her embarra&s;&s;ment.&mdash;"Why, nur&s;e," &s;aid Lady Granville, "you and Mi&s;s Sey|mour &s;eem to be old acquaintance?"&mdash;"Ah, Ma|dam,"
<PB N="114" REF="024442_0239_0FC732DA74121BD0">
replied the &s;imple cottager, "if I dur&s;t &s;peak, I could tell your La'&s;hip &s;uch &s;tories about her good|ne&s;s! She is the very be&s;t friend I have in the world, God ble&s;s her!"&mdash;"Pray is this your own child?" demanded Lady Granville&mdash;"No, plea&s;e your La'|&s;hip; but," with a very &s;ignificant &s;hrug, "your La'&s;hip mu&s;t a&s;k me no more que&s;tions."</P>
<P>Here Loui&s;a aro&s;e, and, under pretence of care about the child's health, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed nur&s;e and her little charge.&mdash;It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the con|fu&s;ion and agitation into which &s;he was thrown, by this unexpected rencounter. No &s;ooner was &s;he &s;eated, than Lady Granville &s;aid, with a &s;mile, "My dear Loui&s;a, you did not u&s;e to conceal any of your plea&s;ures from me;&mdash;pray, when did you come po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this little trea&s;ure?"&mdash;"Indeed Madam," an&s;wered Loui&s;a, with a deep &s;igh, "if the knowledge of this child could have yielded you any &s;atisfaction, you &s;hould long &s;ince have been made acquainted with it. But it is a poor unfortunate babe, who has no one to care for it."&mdash;"Whatever may have been its misfortunes," &s;aid Lord Ha&s;tings, "it &s;urely may now be accounted happy, in having &s;o kind, &s;o compa&s;&s;ionate a protectre&s;s."</P>
<P>By this time they reached the Ca&s;tle, and Lady Granville perceiving, from the embarra&s;&s;ment of Loui&s;a's manner, that there was &s;omething my&s;teri|ous in the hi&s;tory of the child, which &s;he did not wi&s;h to communicate, allowed the &s;ubject to drop.</P>
<P>Next day, however, on their being left alone, &s;he gave Lady Granville a full account of the af|fair, and ended her narrative with &s;aying, "I &s;hould certainly have entreated your Lady&s;hip's protection for this helple&s;s innocent, had I not known, that by
<PB N="115" REF="024442_0240_0FC732E26CA91718">
becoming an object of your attention, people would have been led to inquire into the circum&s;tances of her birth, which both honour and humanity promp|ted me to conceal; be&s;ides, ob&s;curity is &s;urely the mo&s;t proper &s;ituation for one born under &s;uch un|fortunate circum&s;tances. I was often tempted to reveal the &s;tory of its unhappy mother, at a time when your Lady&s;hip's humanity might have affor|ded her relief; but the earne&s;tne&s;s with which &s;he conjured me to conceal her error from the world, withheld me, together with my being per&s;uaded, that the be&s;t &s;ecurity for the future good conduct of &s;uch an unfortunate wanderer, is the conviction that it is &s;till in their power, not only to return to virtue, but to pre&s;erve reputation."</P>
<P>Lady Granville highly applauded Loui&s;a's conduct in this whole affair; and could not help expre&s;&s;ing her admiration of &s;o much prudence, di&s;played at &s;o early an age.</P>
<P>Lord Ha&s;tings now felt his curio&s;ity to known the hi&s;tory of the child, redoubled by the &s;cene of the preceding evening; accordingly he walked out early in the morning, and, on reaching the cottage, be|gan to repeat the &s;ame que&s;tions he had formerly put to the nur&s;e: "You tell me," &s;ays he, "that this child is none of your own; but &s;urely, nur&s;e, you mu&s;t know to whom it belongs?"&mdash;"Indeed, that I don't," an&s;wered &s;he, "and if I did, I dur&s;t not tell your honour, becau&s;e the &s;weet young lady at the Ca&s;tle brought it me nine months ago, and told me that its father was gone in foreign parts, and it had not one &s;oul of living to care for it:&mdash;but &s;ure I am, the mother that bore her, could not love my little Sally better than &s;he does; for, if your

When I re|turned home, I was taken with the &s;ame fever; and, would your honour believe it, that good angel&mdash;for if there's one in Heaven, &s;he is&mdash;came twice every day to &s;ee me, and gave me all the &s;tuff the 'potecary &s;ent me with her own hand, and brought me fruit, and gave me money to pay his bill, and every thing I wanted, till I got pure well again."</P>
<P>The countenance of Lord Ha&s;tings underwent many changes during the cour&s;e of this conver&s;ation. Having given the good woman a guinea, and char|ged her to be kind to the child, he returned to the Ca&s;tle; but his curio&s;ity was rather increa&s;ed than pimini&s;hed by his interview with the nur&s;e.</P>

The moment he entered his mother's apartment, finding her alone, he introduced the &s;ubject of the child. She gave him a minute detail of all the cir|cum&s;tances Mi&s;s Seymour had related concerning the unfortunate Sally; and he felt his admiration of her increa&s;ed, by every new light in which they placed her exalted character.&mdash;His mother, who watched every look and word which expre&s;&s;ed a pa&s;&s;ion &s;he wi&s;hed to confirm, joined cordially in the prai&s;es he a thou&s;and times repeated, of the &s;ingular prudence and delicacy of the generous and noble-minded Loui&s;a.</P>
<P>That evening Lady Granville remarked that Loui&s;a looked very pale; and the weather being remarkably <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ine, de&s;ired Lord Ha&s;tings to take her out to walk: "You forget your own health, Lou|i&s;a," &s;aid &s;he, "in your concern about me; but remember, my love," &s;he added, with a look of the mo&s;t tender &s;olicitude, "that, next to that of Ha|&s;tings, on your &s;afety my future comfort depends."</P>
<P>They pa&s;&s;ed through the garden, and wandered down the field, which was fragrant with the new|mown hay. The &s;tillne&s;s of the air, the &s;erene face of the &s;ky, and the wild notes of a thru&s;h from the neigh|bouring wood, were perfectly in harmony with their feelings.&mdash;When they reached the bench, the &s;un being very hot, and Loui&s;a looking tired, Lord Ha&s;tings reque&s;ted her to &s;it down. They did &s;o; when &s;uddenly recollecting the circum|&s;tance of finding the letter there, he became &s;ilent and thoughtful&mdash;he &s;ighed heavily, ca&s;t his eyes on the ground, and &s;eemed buried in his own reflecti|ons. Loui&s;a, who&s;e &s;oul vibrated to every emotion of his, &s;oon caught the infectious melancholy.&mdash;
<PB N="118" REF="024442_0243_0FC732EAC4753858">
Their mutual &s;ilence became every moment more embarra&s;&s;ing.&mdash;At la&s;t, looking up, and fixing his eyes on Loui&s;a, with a re&s;pectful and timid air, "O Mi&s;s Seymour," &s;aid he, "may I pre&s;ume to hope, from the pre&s;ent &s;erenity of your mind, that all ob&s;tacles to your felicity are at la&s;t removed?"</P>
<P>The con&s;cious heart of Loui&s;a took alarm at the fir&s;t word of this &s;peech; &s;he became pale as death, and trembled &s;o violently, that Lord Ha&s;tings was obliged to &s;upport her in his arms. Afraid of her fainting, he ha&s;tily endeavoured to unloo&s;e her cloak, to give her air; but, in his agitation, caught hold at the &s;ame time of the &s;tring of pearls by which his picture was hung, and pulling the cloak away, the &s;tring broke, and the picture, together with the locket, fell to the ground. He &s;tooped to take it up; but how inexpre&s;&s;ible was his a&s;toni&s;h|ment, on di&s;covering that it was his own!&mdash;"Pow|erful Heaven!" cried he, "can I credit my &s;en&s;es!&mdash;Loui&s;a, my adored Loui&s;a! is it po&s;&s;ible? Was it on this lifele&s;s image I &s;aw thee be&s;tow thy pre|cious tears?"&mdash;He had time for no more.&mdash;Du|ring a few moments the face and neck of Mi&s;s Sey|mour were covered with blu&s;hes; again her coun|tenance became pale, her head dropped on his &s;houlder, and &s;he continued for &s;everal minutes without &s;en&s;e or motion.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of Lord Ha&s;tings almo&s;t equalled her own; but far other were his feelings, when he &s;aw her return to life. He pre&s;&s;ed her to his bo|&s;om, which throbbed with unutterable tran&s;port; and again <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ixing his eyes on her averted face,&mdash;"Tell me, Loui&s;a," &s;aid he, "O tell me, do I not dream?

<PB N="119" REF="024442_0244_0FC732EC3A99CCF0">
&mdash;"Oh, Ha&s;tings!" &s;he replied, "how can you doubt it?"</P>
<P>The mo&s;t tender, delightful, intere&s;ting conver|&s;ation now en&s;ued. The letter of Grammont, the &s;chemes of Lord Granville, the embarra&s;&s;ing &s;ituati|on of Loui&s;a, and the ill-grounded jealou&s;ies of Lord Ha&s;tings, led to &s;uch a variety of tender and affec|ting explanations, that the&s;e happy lovers forgot the hours; nor knew that they had &s;pent more than two together, till they &s;aw a &s;ervant coming down the field in &s;earch of them.</P>
<P>With the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Lord Ha&s;tings's arm, Loui|&s;a reached the Ca&s;tle; but her emotion was &s;till &s;o vi&s;ible, that Lady Granville in&s;tantly ob&s;erved it: "Henry," &s;aid &s;he, "you have certainly walked too far; Loui&s;a looks quite exhau&s;ted&mdash;I will ne|ver again entru&s;t you with my daughter."&mdash;"In|deed, my deare&s;t mother," &s;aid he, taking hold of her hand, which he pre&s;&s;ed between his, "you mu&s;t be&s;tow her on me your&s;elf&mdash;you mu&s;t entru&s;t her to me for ever."</P>
<P>Loui&s;a was &s;till &s;o greatly agitated, that &s;he was unable to li&s;ten to this explanation: She retired, therefore, into Lady Granville's dre&s;&s;ing-room, whil&s;t Lord Ha&s;tings repeated to her all that had pa&s;&s;ed. Could his happine&s;s have admitted of any increa&s;e, it would have been augmented by the warmth and tenderne&s;s of his mother's approbation.</P>
<P>She aro&s;e, and, on entering the dre&s;&s;ing-room, "Now, now, my Loui&s;a," cried &s;he, cla&s;ping her to her bo&s;om, you are indeed my daughter!" Then joining her hand with that of Lord Ha&s;tings, who had followed her, "May Heaven for ever ble&s;s my

children," &s;aid &s;he, "and that God who made them virtuous, make them completely happy!"</P>
<P>The happine&s;s of this amiable pair was now, in|deed, as exqui&s;ite and unmixed as any which the mo&s;t glowing imagination could repre&s;ent. The late agitated &s;tate of their minds rendered the calm, which now &s;ucceeded it, peculiarly delightful.&mdash;Their felicity, however, was cha&s;tened at times by their anxiety about Lady Granville, who&s;e health had not yet recovered the dreadful &s;hock it &s;u&s;tain|ed by the death of her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>None more &s;incerely partook in their tran&s;port than the generous Lady Lei&s;ter, who was then at the Earl's &s;eat in&mdash;&s;hire; and whom Loui&s;a immediately informed of the happy ecclairci&s;&s;ement above-mentioned.</P>
<P>The day following, on Loui&s;a's being longer ab|&s;ent from the dining-room than u&s;ual, Lord Ha&s;|tings went in &s;earch of her to the garden; and, on entering the pavilion, which had been the &s;cene of &s;o many intere&s;ting interviews, was not a little &s;tart|led on &s;eeing Loui&s;a &s;itting there, with a letter in her hand, almo&s;t drowned in tears.

</LETTER>
<P>Lord Ha&s;tings was greatly affected with this let|ter. It touched &s;ome &s;trings in his heart, that ac|corded to its pathetic language with a &s;adne&s;s and &s;en&s;ibility almo&s;t too exqui&s;ite to be borne. The &s;orrows of &s;uch hearts, however, are delightful; and whil&s;t the&s;e fond lovers, the&s;e faithful friends,
<PB N="122" REF="024442_0247_0FC732F73195FC28">
mingled their &s;ighs together, the bitterne&s;s of grief was in&s;en&s;ibly converted into that &s;weet and tender &s;ympathy, which gently agitates, without over|whelming the &s;oul.</P>
<P>Lord Ha&s;tings pre&s;&s;ed the hand of Loui&s;a to his bo&s;om, wiped away her tears, &s;oothed her with love and tenderne&s;s, and encouraged her to hope, that from change of air, time, and other remedies, Ade|laide might &s;till recover. Reflecting, that the re&s;|pect due to the memory of a revered parent mu&s;t a while delay that event to which all his wi&s;hes were directed, he prevailed on Loui&s;a, by the hope of once more beholding her friend, to join with him in reque&s;ting Lady Granville to make trial for a few months of the air of the Continent. He knew that the novelty and variety of the objects &s;he would meet with in this little tour, would nece&s;&s;arily di|vert her thoughts from the melancholy &s;ubject which con&s;tantly occupied them; and likewi&s;e &s;erve to relieve Loui&s;a from that awkward conciou&s;ne&s;s attending her pre&s;ent &s;ituation.</P>
<P>With much difficulty, Lady Granville was pre|vailed on to enter into a &s;cheme, which called for an exertion to which her &s;pirits were very unequal; but con&s;cious of its propriety, and accu&s;tomed, from the &s;ingular benevolence of her heart, ever willingly to &s;acrifice her own feelings to the com|fort or advantage of others, &s;he &s;trove at la&s;t to comply with the &s;olicitations of her children, and, in gratitude for their duteous care of her health, to do &s;o with cheerfulne&s;s: "There is only one con|dition, Loui&s;a," &s;aid &s;he, "that can prevail on me to become a traveller at my age; and that is, that as &s;oon as I am weary of France, you &s;hall &s;tand en|gaged
<PB N="123" REF="024442_0248_0FC732F9F49BDD70">
to find me a daughter ready to love, honour, and obey, the moment I return to England."&mdash;Loui&s;a blu&s;hed; and Lord Ha&s;tings, cla&s;ping his mother's hand, thanked her with his fine intelligent eyes, for this kind hint.</P>
<P>To avoid ob&s;ervation, they &s;et out with very few attendants, and reached Paris by &s;low and ea&s;y journies. Being properly accommodated in lodg|ings, in a retired village in the neighbourhood of Ver&s;ailles, the very day after their arrival, leaving Lady Granville behind, Lord Ha&s;tings conducted the anxiou&s;ly impatient Loui&s;a to the Convent of St. Cire. She could not again enter the&s;e &s;acred walls, without feeling her heart &s;well with a con|fu&s;ed variety of emotions. The&s;e were not le&s;&s;ened on hearing, that, a few hours after &s;ending her la&s;t letter to her friend, the gentle Adelaide peacefully ended her innocent life.</P>
<P>Lord Ha&s;tings partook in her virtuous &s;orrow; but whil&s;t he did not venture to condemn, he gent|ly endeavoured to calm and moderate her affliction.&mdash;How exqui&s;itely &s;oothing is that &s;ympathy, which unites at once the ardour and delicacy of friend&s;hip with the matchle&s;s tenderne&s;s of love!</P>
<P>Whil&s;t &s;he &s;at down in the parlour, to compo&s;e her mind, and recover her &s;cattered &s;pirits, &s;he re|ceived a me&s;&s;age from the abbe&s;s, reque&s;ting to &s;ee her.</P>
<P>On entering her apartment, &s;he pre&s;ented her with a &s;mall box, which Adelaide bequeathed to her with her dying breath. Loui&s;a received it with every mark of reverence for the beloved donor. She reque&s;ted to be &s;hewn the &s;pot where &s;he was bu|ried;
<PB N="124" REF="024442_0249_0FC732FF4E725570">
and having paid the tribute of gratitude and friend&s;hip to a friend endeared to her heart by eve|ry virtue, &s;he returned to Lord Ha&s;tings, who im|patiently waited for her, and immediately conduc|ted her back to Ver&s;ailles.</P>
<P>Loui&s;a retired to her apartment, to indulge, with|out witne&s;&s;es, tho&s;e tears which &s;erved to relieve her heart. She then addre&s;&s;ed the following letter to Lady Lei&s;ter, whom &s;he had promi&s;ed to inform of the fate of Adelaide, as &s;oon as &s;he &s;hould be made acquainted with it.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Lady Lei&s;ter.</HEAD>
<P>&mdash;Already, my dear friend, that &s;ingular hap|pine&s;s, on the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of which you &s;o warmly congratulate me, has &s;uffered a cruel interruption; already tears mingle with my joy!&mdash;Ah, with hu|mility and moderation does it become man to en|joy that pro&s;perity, which a thou&s;and accidents are ever at hand to embitter&mdash;which, however great, cannot be la&s;ting&mdash;and which mu&s;t, in this &s;tate of trial, be one day &s;ucceeded by that adver&s;ity, which, by contra&s;t, it renders more &s;evere.</P>
<P>The kind, the generous Ha&s;tings, who prevents or indulges every wi&s;h of my heart, carried me to St. Cire the very day after our arrival.&mdash;How &s;hall I de&s;cribe the variety of feelings, with which I once more entered that &s;acred abode of piety and peace!&mdash;My trembling apprehen&s;ions were &s;oon exchang|ed for fatal certainty!</P>
<P>I had a long conver&s;ation with the venerable abbe&s;s, who informed me, after expatiating on the exemplary virtues of the dear decea&s;ed, that &s;he not
<PB N="125" REF="024442_0250_0FC7330097DAD3A8">
only quitted life with cheerful re&s;ignation, but tri|umph and joy!&mdash;With her dying lips &s;he ble&s;&s;ed me, bequeathed a little ca&s;ket to me, as a memorial of her friend&s;hip, and bade tho&s;e around tell me, "that though divided for a little, we &s;hould &s;urely meet again."</P>
<P>I cannot help regretting my ab&s;ence from this &s;olemn, affecting &s;cene. Yet, alas! why &s;hould I regret it? My affliction would only have rendered death more formidable&mdash;might have di&s;turbed her heavenly compo&s;ure, and clogged her a&s;cending &s;pirit.</P>
<P>I re&s;olved to vi&s;it all that now remained of the beauteous, amiable, admired Adelaide.&mdash;As I ap|proached the lowly dwelling, "I go to meet my friend," &s;aid I; "but where are now the open arms, the &s;miling countenance, and throbbing heart that were wont to welcome me?"&mdash;The lay-&s;i&s;ter pointed out the humble, undi&s;tingui&s;hed &s;pot, where the fir&s;t of women repo&s;es, and retired: "That faithful heart &s;hall beat no more!&mdash;No more &s;hall &s;orrow heave that clay-cold bo&s;om!&mdash;The &s;hower of &s;pring &s;hall return&mdash;but no leaf of her's &s;hall ari&s;e!&mdash;She is gone, &s;he is gone for ever, and the place that once knew her, &s;hall know her no more!"</P>
<P>As I uttered this &s;entence, I was &s;tartled by &s;omething which moved the &s;od with which the grave was covered: It was her little dog Fidelle, the la&s;t gift of Grammont, on which &s;he doated, and who had made it&s;elf a bed under the &s;od at the foot of her grave, which nothing could induce it to quit &s;ince the hour of her interment. The affectionate little animal knew me, and looked pi|teou&s;ly
<PB N="126" REF="024442_0251_0FC733020169F810">
in my face; but immediately on perceiving its mi&s;tre&s;s was not with me, laid down its head, and re&s;umed its former po&s;ture.</P>
<P>This little affecting circum&s;tance quite over|came me.&mdash;My ever watchful attentive Ha&s;tings, afraid that this &s;cene might prove too &s;evere a trial for my weak &s;pirits, approached; and giving me his arm, led me back in &s;ilence to the convent.</P>
<P>I then retired, to vi&s;it her cell, that I might be more compo&s;ed before returning to the parlour:&mdash;Her chair, her bed, her books, &s;urrounded me! The very pen with which &s;he had la&s;t addre&s;&s;ed me, lay on her table!&mdash;How pathetic was the &s;ilent language in which they &s;poke to my &s;ad &s;oul!&mdash;There was a becoming &s;tillne&s;s in the de&s;olate dwel|ling, that gently harmonized my feelings and com|po&s;ed my mind.&mdash;I reflected with gratitude on the happine&s;s our mutual friend&s;hip had &s;upplied; and ble&s;&s;ed God, that from the hour of its com|mencement, we had never given each other a mo|mentary pain, nor wounded the delicacy of each other's affection, by carele&s;s neglect or culpable in|gratitude.</P>
<P>And now, having recovered tolerable compo|&s;ure, I came back to the parlour, where Ha&s;tings impatiently waited for me; and taking a la&s;t look, and breathing a la&s;t &s;igh to St. Cire, and the me|mory of its tranquil plea&s;ures, returned to Lady Granville.</P>
<P>On opening the little ca&s;ket, I found it contain|ed the picture of Grammont; a beautiful land&s;cape, &s;uppo&s;ed to be the &s;cenery round the fort of&mdash;,

<P>The &s;ituation in which we now find our&s;elves, is perhaps the mo&s;t delightful which the human imagination could paint.

On inquir|ing of Patty how I was employed, the &s;imple girl informed him, and added, out of her great affec|tion, "I'm afraid, Sir, my mi&s;tre&s;s has received &s;ome bad news, for &s;he is writing of letters, and &s;eems in great affliction.

<P>To-morrow, my dear Lady Lei&s;ter, we begin that journey, which, I tru&s;t, is to bring us in health and happine&s;s to our native land.</P>
<P>My time now is chiefly employed in concer|ting, with my deare&s;t Ha&s;tings, that future plan of conduct, by pur&s;uing which we &s;hall en&s;ure &s;elf-approbation, if we cannot uninterrupted felicity.

<P>Her piety is without o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">entation, and her zeal without bigotry.
