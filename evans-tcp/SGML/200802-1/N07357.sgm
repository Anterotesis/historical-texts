<P>A THANKSGIVING SERMON, FOR THE IMPORTANT and ASTONISHING VICTORY Obtain'd on the Fifth of DECEMBER, M,DCC,LVII, By the Glorious King of PRUSSIA. Over the united and far superior FORCES of the <HI>AUSTRIANS,</HI> in Silesia: PREACHED ON The SABBATH of the Tenth of said Month, AT THE Synagogue of the JEWS, in <HI>Berlin.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The PUBLISHER's PREFACE, TO THE Christian READER.</HEAD>
<P><HI>IT may seem strange that this</HI> SERMON <HI>should appear in a new Edition, when the</HI> Occasi|on <HI>of it is almost forgotten. But the Interposi|tion of Providence in Favour of his</HI> PRUSSIAN MAJESTY, <HI>is an Instance of</HI> GOD'<HI>s Power over Princes, that deserves the serious Consi|deration of all Mankind, as it furnishes a strong Encouragement to trust in the</HI> GREAT ARBI|TER <HI>of human Affairs, and to do our Duty with Constancy and Resolution under the great|est Discouragements.&mdash;Nor is the</HI> SERMON <HI>less singular, as it is the Production of a</HI> JEW, <HI>and occasioned by the Victory and Success of that</HI> MONARCH. <HI>No Nation under Heaven has
<PB N="iii" REF="009390_0003_0F7343B4590E3EE0">
been more severely treated, or more universally persecuted than this poor unhappy People: Their Prejudices against our</HI> LORD JESUS CHRIST, <HI>as the promised</HI> MESSIAH, <HI>have given too just Grounds to Christians to be displeased with their hard Speeches, and evil Conduct, but can be no Warrant to rob, or oppress, or to persecute and destroy them. Our</HI> LORD, <HI>whose Example we should follow, wept for the Hardness of their Hearts, and prayed even for those that conspired to take away his Life; and the Apostle</HI> Paul, <HI>who knew their Obstinacy and their Mistakes, informs us, that his Heart's Desire and Prayer for</HI> Israel <HI>was that they might be saved. And from the Promises in the sacred Volumes, that this Nation, that are beloved of God for their Father's Sake, shall be again restored to the di|vine Favour, all the Christian Churches seem to love them and pray earnestly for their Resto|ration; and why should they not shew them the fame Love and Tenderness in a civil Capacity? From this little Performance it is evident that they have</HI> Patriot Sentiments, <HI>and the warm|est Gratitude to Princes who have Wisdom and Humanity to protect and defend them: Hence it also appears that they have just Sentiments of</HI> GOD<HI>'s moral Government, and of his Care of just Princes, and declare that no Power is too weak when protected by God, and no human
<PB N="iv" REF="009390_0004_0F7343B7B6105118">
Combinations able to effect their Purposes when he blasts their Schemes, and laughs at their Councils.</HI></P>
<P><HI>As the blessed AEra is drawing near when</HI> Jews <HI>and</HI> Gentiles <HI>shall every where be one Church to Chirist Jesus, it is hoped that such Specimens of Dependence on God and Gratitude to Mankind, as appears in this Sermon will ex|cite all Christian People to pray, yet more ear|nestly, for the Conversion and Restoration of this once happy Nation, and to treat them with Kindness in all their Dispersions. 'Tis not for Men too critically to enquire into the Times and Seasons that God has reserved to himself, but from what we have often read in the sacred Scriptures and prophane History, and from his powerful Interpositions in Favour of the King of</HI> Prussia, <HI>we are convinced that he can easily raise up Instruments to accomplish his whole Will and Pleasure, and to make his sav|ing Health known to all Nations.</HI></P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>PSAL. xxii. v. 23, 24.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>Ye that fear the Lord, praise him: All ye the Seed of</HI> Jacob&punc; <HI>glorify him; and fear him, all ye the Seed of</HI> Israel. <HI>For he hath not despised nor held in Scorn the Affliction of the Afflicted: Neither hath he hid his Face from him; but when he cried unto him, he heard.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>LET us this Day, my Beloved, solemnly impress on our Hearts these Words of the Royal Prophet; for we are the Afflicted, <HI>whose Affliction the Lord hath not despised, nor held in Scorn.</HI> Join with me in a Retrospect on those calamituous Times, when our Sufferings were without any apparent Issue; when the Miseries of War, with a strong and outstretched Arm, were hastening to surround us on all Sides; when the exulting Enemy boast|ed, <HI>That the Lord was no longer our Helper. Selah.</HI> Re|flect what Earthly Power was able to disperse the Storm, which impended over our Heads; or what human Un|derstanding could have foreseen the Plan, by which our Deliverance was to be wrought? Our Ruin seemed ine|viatble. The ravenous Nations of the Earth had already made Spoil of us, in their proud Imaginations. But <HI>he who sitteth in Heaven derides them; the Lord laugheth them to Scorn.</HI> He tried us. He caused us to feel the Rod of his Chastisements, that we should humble ourselves
<PB N="6" REF="009390_0006_0F7343B990C61910">
before him; that, with contrite Hearts, we should pour out our Supplications to him, <HI>This the Lord hath done, that he might be feared.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He has not hid his Face from us.</HI> The distingushing Favour of the Most High to our Sovereign, in being a Sun and Shield to him; in protecting him under his Wings; is, to all loyal Subjects, a gladsome Ray of Hope, under the most gloomy Circumstances. Truly, thought we, <HI>our Redeemer liveth; now the Lord hath not forsaken us.</HI> The goodness of our Creator had been our Refuge. We appointed a Day of Public Prayer and Humiliation. Who, my Brethren, can, without Emo|tion, without a sympathising Sadness, call to mind that SOLEMN DAY; when, with one Heart and Voice, ye all prostrated yourselves in this Temple, before the Lord; when the Tears flowing from every Eye, spoke the Tumult of your Hearts; and the Fervour of the Petitions then offered up for the Preservation of our sole Hope, the Welfare of our Sovereign, and for the Success of his righteous Arms? <HI>The Lord hath not despised, nor held our Affliction in Scorn; and when we cry unto him, he hears us.</HI></P>
<P>Behold, he inspired our gracious Monarch, with a Wisdom, which the Prudent of the Earth stand amazed at. He confirmed the known Valour of his Men of War. He bore them on Eagles Wings, wherever their Leader pointed. <HI>He guides his chosen Nation with his Goodness!</HI> He sent his Terrors before him; he scatter'd the Enemy, and overthrew the Schemes they most con|fided in. Who can withstand the Omnipotent? <HI>Who, among the Mighty, is like unto thee! Who, like thee, is strengthened with Holiness!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Now praise the Lord, ye that fear him.</HI> Let the Ar|dour which animated your Prayers in the Day of Distress, now express itself in your Thanksgivings. As this Tem|ple has been wet with Tears of Grief and Oppression, let it now see Tears of Joy and Gratitude. We have openly cryed unto the Lord; openly in the Eyes of the
<PB N="7" REF="009390_0007_0F7343B9AC5ECB90">
whole astonished World, hath he heard us: Let our Thanksgivings also be open. <HI>I will declare thy Name unto my Brethren,</HI> says the anointed of God; <HI>I will praise thee in the Congregation.</HI> When a poor Mortal does us any Kindness; when a Prince condescends to assure us of his Favour; when a Patron procures us any Bene|fit; or, when a common Friend steps in to our Relief in the Time of Trouble; we delay not to return our Thanks. No Words can express our Acknowledgement. We intreat them to be persuaded that their Kindness is not thrown away on an ungrateful Person. With what eager Joy do we run from Friend to Friend? Wish me Joy! embrace me my Friend! the King intends me some Good. Such a great Man has done me a conside|rable Favour; Or, such a worthy Person has stood my Friend in such an Exigency! Are we such towards weak mortal Benefactors? with what Sentiments should our Hearts glow, when the Supreme Benefactor, to deliver us from the rage of Destruction, works Miracles in the Face of the whole World! Oh! that we could so raise our Voices, that as all <HI>Europe</HI> has seen or heard of the mighty Wonder, it might now also have some Idea of the Transport, some Elevation of Soul, with which we celebrate the Lord's Goodness! Be it known to all the Ends of the Earth, that the Lord does not forsake such <HI>as put their trust in him: That they may turn unto the Lord, and that all the Kindreds of the Earth may worship before him.</HI> Psal. xxii. 27.</P>
<P>The Thanksgiving acceptable to God, is to promote, among our Brethren, the Knowledge of his Greatness, and a Zeal for his Service. To rouze, by our Example, the Torpid, and to call on the Depressed; <HI>Come, let us rejoice in the Lord! Know that the Lord is God; it is he that hath made us. His Goodness is everlasting, and his Truth endureth from Generation to Generation.</HI></P>
<P>We have already, on another Occasion, put you in Mind, dearly beloved Brethren, of the House of <HI>Jacob,</HI> that rejoicing on any extraordinary Favour of God, does
<PB N="8" REF="009390_0008_0F7343BA6D3B1A00">
not consist in sumptuous Entertainments and Revels, in wild Acclamations, and much less in Gratifications which disgrace human Nature; no, the Joy which becomes the Man of Holiness, and which alone will be approved of by God, must be a spiritual Joy, penetrating into our inmost Heart, and prompting us to shew forth his Praise, to meditate on his loving Kindness, and to offer to him the Sacrifice of good Works, and Vows of Benevolence.</P>
<P>We rejoice, that our Remonstrance has not been with|out its proper Fruit. Ye have made Vows, for the Re|lief of the Poor; and particularly, of the Widows and Orphans of those brave Soldiers, who have laid down their Lives for their Country and the just Cause of their Prince: And these Vows, you may be assur'd, are of much sweeter Savour to God, than Thousands of Re|joicings, as they are called; but as the Fondness for ex|travagant Festevity is deep rooted in the human Heart, and to overcome these Allurements is a severe and ardu|ous Work; on this joyful Opportunity, we shall briefly remind you of those Reasons, which then convinced us of the abovementioned Truth.</P>
<P>The sacred Prophets frequently inculcate to us, that God <HI>rejoices not in the Death of the Wicked.</HI> To specify the several Passages would be superfluous. There is none of you who can be unacquainted with them.</P>
<P>Our Rabbies, and Doctors of the Oral Law, go fur|ther. They tell us, that on the Overthrow of <HI>Pharoah,</HI> and his Host in the <HI>Red&punc;Sea,</HI> through which the Chil|dren of <HI>Israel</HI> had passed dry-shod, the Lord spoke unto them, saying; <HI>The Works of mine Hands sink in the Seas, and ye are singing before me!</HI> Consider, my beloved Friends, if it was so when only the Heathens perished; Heathens, who had no Knowledge of the Supreme Be|ing, and who polluted the whole Earth with their Ido|latries, what shall we say in our Days, when such a Light has been diffused among all civilized Nations, that they worship the Creator of the Earth, and his Name is a Holiness among them? We are all Children of the one
<PB N="9" REF="009390_0009_0F7343BBAEE31CE0">
living God. They, who declare themselves our Ene|mies, are equally the Works of his Hands, and love and fear him; and we should love them, were they not se|duced by perverse Passions, to disturb the Tranquility of our dear Sovereign. Can we then shout, and give ourselves up to the frantic Excesses of a sensual Joy, at the Destruction of the Works of God's Hands!</P>
<P>It may be objected: It is not from the Defeat of the Enemy, that our Joy arises. God forbid that we should be pleased with Slaughter, or that our Eyes should take a Delight in viewing the Streams of human Blood; which, to the disgrace of Mankind, are incessantly flow|ing. But Truth and Justice bear Witness against our Enemies, as it is manifest that our mild Sovereign is perfectly innocent of these vast Effusions of Blood; and that it is only absolute Necessity, derived from perfidious Machinations, that he has drawn that victorious Sword, which otherwise, though possessed, in such Pre-eminence, of all military Qualities, he would have wished might have rested in Peace. Shall we not rejoice, that Justice triumphs; that the Sagacity of our King, baffles the Devices of the Enemy; that his Heroism, and the In|trepedity of our Countrymen, will shine in History, and be the Admiration of latest Posterity?</P>
<P>I answer; If your Joy springs from so pure a Source, see that it be not only blameless, but commendable, and pleasing to God: But, my beloved Brethren, forget not also, that the primary Cause of our Deliverance is to be sought for in something higher than the Prudence of Man; than worldly Experience in War, or habitual Va|lour. <HI>Behold, the Eyes of the Lord are on them who fear him, who hope on his Goodness; that he may deliver their Soul.</HI> Acknowledge the Hand of the gracious Preserver of the Earth! He it was who suggested to our Deliverer such Plans as all History cannot parrellel! He it was who armed, with Intripidity, the Breasts of your Coun|trymen; who enabled them to perform, under the Con|duct of our incomparable Sovereign, Exploits which
<PB N="10" REF="009390_0010_0F7343BC1BA67208">
future Ages must necessarily look upon as Adventures of the fabulous Ages! You have seen Wonders and su|pernatural Things, of which, antiently, your Ancestors alone could boast. Lay them to&punc; Heart with a proper In|tenseness, and your Souls will be absorbed in Devotion and placid Contemplation; in Solaces infinitely sweeter, than all Mirth and Diversion; which, however they fa|cinate the Senses, never reach the Soul!</P>
<P>Imitate the GLORIOUS VICTOR! the WISE MON|ARCH! whom the Lord hath chosen as the Instrumnet of Prodigies! However Self-love may dazzle the Eyes of the Bulk of Mankind: none of the Victories which he has obtained over his Persecutors, does he ascribe to himself. All the Honour he refers solely to the Lord; who blesses his Arms, enlightens his Understanding, and strengthens his Heart. No sooner had the flying Enemy left him the Victory and the Field of Battle, than jointly, with his whole triumpant Army, he returns Thanks to the Giver of all Good. I see him! I see the august Warrior in the Presence of his Troops, lift up his wea|ried Hands to Heaven: "Lord my Creator!" cries he, <Q>thou knowest how innocent I am, of all the Blood shed this Day. Such was thy Will, Father. Now, my loyal Fellow Soldiers, thank him with Heart and Mouth; for he it is who has deliver'd us.</Q></P>
<P>These Words suspend the Pangs of Death. The ex|piring Soldiers make a last Effort to raise themselves; and, with broken Accents, join the Hymn, which was sung with Extacy by the whole Army, whilst Tears dropped from the Eyes of the Royal Hero. <HI>The Lord counteth those Tears,</HI> and accepts of them as Witnessess against the Unrighteous, who would load the King with the Guilt of all this Carnage: <HI>Therefore shall his Eenemies be turned back; and, when he calls, he shall find that the Lord is his Helper.</HI></P>
<P>There may be still some Relicks of Doubt on your Minds, in Opposition to the Premises. If what the Lord has done for us, say you, be a supernatural
<PB N="11" REF="009390_0011_0F7343BCDFE14140">
Act, a Miracle; where to serve all the military Dis|positions, the Implements of War, the King's Conduct, and the Vigour of the Soldiery? Could not the Angel have gone forth from the Lord, and, in a Night, have swept away all the Forces of the Enemy? With the Al|mighty there is no Impossibility; nay, Instances of such Miracles are not wanting in the Holy Scriptures.</P>
<P>My beloved Friends, favour me with your Attention, whilst I read and comment on a Passage in the SACRED BOOK of the LAW, which will remove all our Doubts.</P>
<P>We read in the First Book of the Law, Chap. xvi. <HI>And it came to pass in the Days of</HI> Amraphel, <HI>King of</HI> Shinar; Arioch, <HI>King of</HI> Ellaser; Chedorlaomer, <HI>King of</HI> Elam; <HI>and</HI> Tidal, <HI>King of the Nations; that they made War with</HI> Bera, <HI>King of</HI> Sodom; <HI>with</HI> Birsha, <HI>King of</HI> Gomarrah; <HI>with</HI> Shinab, <HI>King of</HI> Admah; <HI>with</HI> She|meber, <HI>King of</HI> Zeboiim; <HI>and with the King of</HI> Bela, <HI>now</HI> Zoar; <HI>And all these came together in the Vale of</HI> Siddim, <HI>where now is the Salt Sea. Twelve Years they had been under</HI> Chedorlaomer, <HI>but in Thirteenth they revolted: Therefore, in the fourtrenth Year, came</HI> Chedorlaomer, <HI>and the Kings that were with him; and at</HI> Ashteroth Kar|naim, <HI>defeated the</HI> Rephaims, <HI>(or the Giants) and in</HI> Ham, <HI>the</HI> Susims, <HI>(or the Valiant) and in</HI> Kiriathaim-Plain, <HI>the</HI> Emims, <HI>(or the Formidable) and the</HI> Horites, <HI>in their Mount</HI> Seir, <HI>to the Plain of</HI> Param, <HI>which joins the Wilderness, Afterwards they turned and came to the</HI> Spring of the Just, <HI>which is</HI> Kadeth; <HI>and over-ran the whole Country of the</HI> Amalekites, <HI>and likewise of the</HI> A|morites, <HI>who inhabited in</HI> Hazezon-Tamar. <HI>Then went out the King of</HI> Sodom, <HI>and the King of</HI> Gomorrah, <HI>the King of</HI> Admah, <HI>the King of</HI> Zeboiim, <HI>and the King of</HI> Bela; <HI>and in the Vale of</HI> Siddim <HI>joined Battle with</HI> Che|dorlaomer, <HI>the King of</HI> Elam; Tidal, <HI>the King of Na|tions;</HI> Amraphel, <HI>the King of</HI> Shinar; <HI>and</HI> Arioch, <HI>King of</HI> Ellaser; <HI>four Kings with five. And in the Vail of</HI> Siddim <HI>were many Bitumen-Pits; and the Kings of</HI> Sod|dom <HI>and</HI> Gomorrah <HI>turned their Backs and fell therein,
<PB N="12" REF="009390_0012_0F7343BD592D7328">
and the Remainder fled to the Mountains: And they took all the Goods and Provisions of</HI> Sodom <HI>and</HI> Gomorrah, <HI>and went away; carrying with them</HI> Lot, Abraham'<HI>s Brother's Son, with all his Effects, for he lived at</HI> Soddom. <HI>And there came one that had escaped and told</HI> Abram, <HI>the</HI> Hebrew, <HI>who lived near the Plain of</HI> Mamre, <HI>the</HI> Amorite, <HI>Brother to</HI> Eshcol <HI>and</HI> Aner; <HI>and these were in Allience with</HI> Abram. <HI>And when</HI> Abram <HI>heard that his Brother was carrid away Captive, he armed his Servants to the Number of three Hundred and Eighteen, all born in his House, and followed them towards</HI> Dan; <HI>where, having divided his Band, he fell upon them in the Night, routed them, and pursued them as far as</HI> Hobah, <HI>which lies on the Left of</HI> Da|mascus. <HI>He recovered all the Spoil; also his Brother</HI> Lot, <HI>with his Effects, the Women and the People. In his Return from the Defeat of</HI> Chedorlaomor, <HI>and the Kings his Confederates, the King of</HI> Sodom <HI>went out to meet him in the Field called the</HI> King'<HI>s</HI> Dale. <HI>And</HI> Melchisedeck, <HI>of</HI> Salem, <HI>brought forth Bread and Wine; and he was a Priest of God the Most High. And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be thou</HI> Abram <HI>of the Most High God, the Possessor of Heaven and Earth: And praised be the Most High God, who hath delivered thine Enemies into thine Hands; and</HI> Abram <HI>gave to him Tythes of every Thing. Then said the King of</HI> Sodom <HI>to</HI> Abram, <HI>Restore the Peo|ple to me, and keep the Spoil to thyself. And</HI> Abram <HI>an|swered the King of</HI> Sodom, <HI>I have lifted up mine Hand to the Lord the Most High God, the Possessor of Heaven and Earth, that of whatever is thine, I will not keep so much as a Thread or Shoe-Latchet, that thou never shalt say thou hast enriched</HI> Abram.</P>
<P>This Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">age you observe, my beloved Brethren, bears a great Resemblance to the happy Occasion of this Day's Solemnity. In the mere Nature of Things, it was im|possible that our Father <HI>Abraham,</HI> who at that Time was still called <HI>Abram,</HI> should, with such a Handful of Men, defeat the Combined Forces of four potent Mon|archs. It is not without Reason, that the Scripture previously acquaints us of the Archievements of these
<PB N="13" REF="009390_0013_0F7343C0B9C0BAA0">
Kings. At <HI>Ashteroth Karnaim,</HI> they had smote the <HI>Gi|ants;</HI> at <HI>Ham,</HI> the <HI>Valiant, (Susim,</HI> the Word in the Text, imports <HI>Invincible,</HI> or <HI>whom none could face)</HI> and at <HI>Kiriathim,</HI> the <HI>Formidable.</HI> Other Nations had also felt the Force of their Arms. The <HI>Horites, Amalchites,</HI> and <HI>Amorites,</HI> submitted to them. At lenghth five Kings entered in a Confederency against these four superb Ra|vagers, and encountered them in the Vale of <HI>Siddim:</HI> but they were totally routed with great Slaughter, and what escaped the Sword was dispersed.</P>
<P>These Successes must naturally have filled all Parts with Consternation. Opposition to such Power, seemed Temerity; that, in the Eye of human Prudence, no|thing was left but to make the best Terms for bowing the Neck to their Yoke.</P>
<P>Not so the great Proto-Patriarch. He, with a few Men raised in his own Family, ventures on a War with these redoubted Conquerors. He was not ignorant what Sort of Enemies he had to deal with. He well knew of what little Account a just Cause and virtuous Views are with the Insolence of Superiority; yet, fearless of the Dangers which naturally threatened his Enterprize, he declares for the Cause of Righteousness and Genero|sity: He arms his Servants, three Hundred and Eigh|teen, born within his House.</P>
<P>It is not improbable that by proper Overtures, he might have increased his Body with the Remains of the defeated Armies; but he chuses rather to take the Field only with a small Number of his Servants, on whose Fi|delity he could rely. They had been born in his Fa|mily, and grown up under his Eye. They had been Witnesses of his irreproachable Life, and felt the Bene|fits of his Virtues. They loved him as their Father, and he them as his Children. They were ready when head|ed by him, to face any Danger; and to rush on Death, when Love and Duty require such a Proof.</P>
<P>Their Leader, on his Part, is not wanting in Strata|gems; and, in order to surprize the secure Enemy on
<PB N="14" REF="009390_0014_0F7343C17A281790">
two Sides, he in the Night divides his small Band. The Result is, that with three Hundred and Eighteen Men, he defeats those four Kings; who, till then, had borne down all Resistance; and whom a Series of Victories and Conquests had rendered the Terror of the neighbouring Nations.</P>
<P>Now to whom will <HI>Abram</HI> attribute this signal Vic|tory? Will he magnify his own Conduct? Will he glo|ry in the Valour of his Domesticks, as invincible? Will he grow proud in his Imaginations, and forget that E|vents are in the Hand of God; and that it is he who gives to the Weak, Strength and Courage? Far other|wise. Please to mind the Sequel: He is met by <HI>Mel|chisedek,</HI> the Priest of God, on his return from the Vic|tory, and followed by a Train of Captives, Spoils and Trophies; the avenged Kings also hastening towards him, to thank him as their Deliverer; Circumstances extremely flattering to human Vanity. Amidst this Pomp of War, the Priest addresses himself to the Victor; and blessing him, says, Abram, <HI>blessed be thou of the Most High God, the Possessor of Heaven and Earth;</HI> that is, who supremely orders all Things in Heaven and Earth, as his Property: <HI>And blessed be God the Most High, who hath delivered thine Enemies into thine Hands.</HI></P>
<P>Here's not a word of <HI>Abram'</HI>s Courage and masterly Dispositions. He does not expatiate on the Zeal and Bravery of his Men. He praises God alone, who had made <HI>Abram</HI> an Instrument for performing Wonders, and had delivered his Enemies into his Hands. <HI>Abram</HI> thanks the Priest of the Most High God; acknowledges all the Praise and Honour to belong only to God; and, in Token of his Gratitude, delivers to the Priest Tythes of all.</P>
<P>In Reality, had <HI>Abram</HI> not placed his whole Confi|dence in God; had he not been penetrated, with lively Persuasion, that <HI>the Lord never forsakes those who sted|fastly seek his Loving-Kindnss,</HI> there would have been more of Rashness and Presumption in his Expedition,
<PB N="15" REF="009390_0015_0F7343C2795064D0">
than of real Magnanimity: But <HI>he believed in God and it was accounted to him for Righteousness.</HI> He relied on God, as to him were known the Justice of his Cause, and the Purity and Disinterestedness of his Views; and this the King of <HI>Sodom</HI> experienced. <HI>I have lift up my Hand to the Lord,</HI> or solemnly sworn, <HI>that of all that is thine I will not take a Thread, or a Shoe-Latchet.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Abram</HI> however, clearly saw, that Providence does not require an inactive, listless Reliance. It is the de|clared Will of our Creator, that we should exert that Strength and Capacity which he has bestowed on us. If ever God alters the Course of Nature, it is for very great and exalted Ends. It is a Saying of our Rabbies, <HI>He does as few Miracles as possible.</HI> Accordingly <HI>Abram</HI> omitted nothing of what his Experience, Prudence and Courage, dictated to him. He left the Nature of Things to operate in its full Extent; placing, as to the Issue, all his Trust in Providence, and the all-sufficient Favour of his Creator.</P>
<P>The Lord blessed his Proceedings, and, by a Mira|cle, performed in his Behalf, what was beyond any na|tural Power, any worldly Prudence, supported by any human Intrepidity.</P>
<P>Will it be necessary, dear and devout Brethren, to make any Application of the foregoing Reflections, to the glorious Transactions of our Days. The same living God, who in so wonderful a Manner succoured our Fa|ther <HI>Abraham,</HI> also now assists our King. The Lord is unchangeable in his Ways. The Powers which he has implanted in Nature, are at present no less finite and li|mitted, than in Ages past; but he upholds it by his Bounty, unless moved by some more sublime and trans|cendant View, and never breaks in upon its determined Course. <HI>He doth not despise, niether holdeth he in Scorn the Misery of the Poor; and when he cries unto him, he hears him:</HI> But he also will not multiply Miracles unne|cessarily. We are to be doing, and make the best Use possible of the Talents with which he has furnished us.

Do you now wonder that all <HI>Europe&punc;</HI> should be filled with Admiration, at the Wisdom and Magnanimity of our great King, and the Valour of our Countrymen; though, by every reflecting Person, the happy Issue is accounted a Miracle? Can it seem strange to any one, that our admirable Hero conducts every Thing with the greatest Circumspection and Prudence, and lets nothing escape him which may forward the Success of his Views; yet should refer to God alone, all the Honour of the Pro|speriety of his Armies?</P>
<P><HI>O give Thanks unto the Lord, extol his Name, make known his Deeds among the Nations. Ye the Seed of</HI> Abra|ham <HI>his Chosen, sing unto him, and praise him, and pro|claim the Wonders which he hath wrought. He is the Lord our God!</HI> Psal. cv.</P>
<P>Let us now, dearly beloved Brethren, with Fervour and Devotion, bow before him; and, from the Bottom of our Hearts, call upon him. the Lord doth not de|spise you, and casts not away his Covenant with you; for he is your God.</P>
<P><HI>Lord of Hosts, God of Sabbath! thou host glorified thy Servant</HI> FREDERICK, <HI>and, for his Sake, hast thou done mighty Things. Continue to give him his Heart's Desire. O grant that the Sword of Destruction may be sheathed; and say to the Angel of Death, Hold thy Hand. May the Shepherds of thy People, the Princes of the Earth, live before thee in Peace and Tranqui|lity: And may Truth and the Knowledge of the Lord fill the Earth, as the Waters cover the Sea. Bless the Family of thy Servant</HI> FREDERICK, <HI>that it may continue forever before thee; for what thou blessest, Lord is blessed for ever. Help thy People, the Remains of thy</HI> Israel; <HI>and, in our Days, may the Redemmer, come to</HI> Zion. Amen.</P>
