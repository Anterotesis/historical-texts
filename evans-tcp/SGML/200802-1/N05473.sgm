<P>FORASMUCH, as there have been many Di&s;putes ari&s;en of late concerning the <HI>Medium of Exchange</HI> in this Colony, which have been occa&s;ioned chiefly by Rea&s;on of our having &s;uch large Quantities of Paper <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> on &s;ome of the Neighbouring Governments, pa&s;&s;ing in Payments among us, and &s;ome of tho&s;e Governments having i&s;&s;ued much larger Sums of &s;uch Bills than were nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upply them&s;elves with a com|petent <HI>Medium of Exchange,</HI> and not having &s;upplied their Trea&s;uries with any Fund for the maintaining the Credit of &s;uch Bills; they have therefore been continually depreciating and growing le&s;s in their Value, and have been the principal Means of the Depreciation of the <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> emitted by this Colony, by their pa&s;&s;ing promi&s;cuou&s;ly with them; and &s;o have been the Occa&s;ion of Much Embarra&s;ment and Inju&s;tice, in the Trade and Commerce of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">olony, and many People and e&s;pecially Widows and Orphans have been great Sufferers thereby. But our Legi&s;lature having at length taken effectual Care to prevent a further Depreciation of the <HI>Bills</HI> of this Colony, and the other Govern|ments not having taken the like prudent Care, their <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> are &s;till &s;inking in their Value, and have in Fact &s;unk much below the Value of the <HI>Bills</HI> of this Colony. Yet &s;ome People among us, by long Cu&s;tom, are &s;o far pre|judiced in Favour of a &s;inking Medium, and others not being really &s;en&s;ible of the true State of the Ca&s;e, are inclined to think that <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> on the neighbouring Governments ought to be a legal Tender in Payments in this Colony for all Debts due by Book and otherwi&s;e where there is no &s;pecial contract expre&s;sly mentioning &s;ome other Currency, and others being of a different Opinion, the Di&s;putes have been
<PB N="4" REF="006933_0004_102a9b50df3dd550">
carried on &s;o far, as to occa&s;ion &s;ome Expence in the Law, and may be likely to occa&s;ion much more, unle&s;s prevented by tho&s;e Prejudices being &s;ome way removed. And &s;ince it is a Cau&s;e wherein every one is more or le&s;s intere&s;ted, I have ventured to &s;hew my Opinion, with a &s;incere De&s;ire to have Peace and Ju&s;tice maintained and promoted in the Colony. Not de&s;iring any Per&s;on to approve of my Ob&s;er|vations any farther than he finds them agreeable to the Principles of Ju&s;tice and right Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>THE CASE STATED.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE a Man comes to a Trader's Shop in this Colony to buy Goods, and the Trader &s;ells him a certain Quan|tity of Goods and tells him the Price is &s;o many Pounds, Shillings and Pence, <HI>(let it be more or le&s;s)</HI> to be paid at the Expiration of one Year, from that Time, and the Man receives the Goods but their is nothing &s;aid either by Sel|ler or Buyer, what Currency it is to be paid in, but the Goods are charged according to the Value of <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> Old Tenor on this Colony.</P>
<P>Now I Query what the Creditor has a Right to demand for a Debt &s;o contracted; or what the Debtor can oblige him to accept in Payment?</P>
<P>The Creditor &s;ays, that the Debt being contracted in the Colony of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> he ought to have what is known by the Laws of &s;aid Colony to be Money: And that he has no Right to demand any thing el&s;e.</P>
<P>The Debtor &s;ays, That <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> on the neighbour|ing Governments have for many Years pa&s;&s;ed promi&s;cuou&s;ly with <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> on this Colony as Money in all Pay|ments, <HI>(except &s;pecial Contracts)</HI> and that People in general where the Contracts ly at large have expected, and do &s;till expect, that any of the <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> on any of the Governments in <HI>New-England,</HI> that have obtained a Currency in this Colony will an&s;wer in Payment, and in as much as the Creditor did not give him any Notice to the con|trary, when he bought the Goods, therefore he thinks that &s;uch <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> ought to be accepted in Payment
<PB N="5" REF="006933_0005_102a9b5272068c90">
for the afore&s;aid Debt. And altho' there is no particular Statute in this Colony, that &s;uch <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> &s;hall be a legal Tender in Payments of Money: Yet the Practice has been &s;o univer&s;al for &s;o long a Time, and the Creditor him&s;elf has both received and pa&s;s'd them as Money con|&s;tantly without making Exceptions again&s;t them 'till this Debt was contracted, and for many Years all Demands on Book Debts have been for Old-Tenor Money indiffe|rently, without Di&s;tinction of Colonies, and Judgments in all Courts have been given thereon accordingly: And any of the afore&s;aid <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> have pa&s;s'd in Payment to &s;atisfy all Judgments, &s;o obtain'd and this univer&s;al Cu&s;tom, the Debtor &s;aith, ought to be e&s;teem'd as common Law and ought not without &s;ome &s;pecial Rea&s;on to be &s;et a&s;ide, and that in this Ca&s;e there is nothing &s;pecial; and therefore the Creditor ought not to make Demand or obtain Judgment different from the common Cu&s;tom of the Colony.</P>
<P>In An&s;wer to this the Creditor &s;aith, that altho' <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> on the neighbouring Governments have for a Number of Years been pa&s;s'd and receiv'd in Payments: Yet it has been only by the voluntary Con&s;ent of the Per&s;ons receiving them, and not becau&s;e they were under any Obligation to receive them; and that it is no Argu|ment that a Per&s;on &s;hall be obliged to receive any species when it won't an&s;wer his End, becau&s;e in Time pa&s;t he has receiv'd it when it would an&s;wer. And the Creditor further &s;aith, that &s;uch <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> are of no intrin&s;ick Value, and their Extrin&s;ical Value is fluctuating and very uncertain, and therefore it would be unju&s;t that any Per&s;on &s;hould be obliged to receive them in Payment as Money in this Colony, (&s;ince neither the Colony nor any of the Inhabitants thereof are under any Obligation either to Refund &s;aid Bills or to maintain the Credit of them) for Money ought to be &s;omething of certain Value, it being that whereby other Things are to be valued. And I think it is a Principle that mu&s;t be granted that no Govern|ment
<PB N="6" REF="006933_0006_102a9b54b9d5f438">
has a Right to impo&s;e on its Subjects any foreign Currency to be received in Payments as Money which is not of intrin&s;ick Value; unle&s;s &s;uch Government will a&s;&s;ume and undertake to &s;ecure and make Good to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of &s;uch Currency the full Value which they oblige him to receive it for. Becau&s;e in &s;o doing they would oblige Men to part with their E&s;tates for that which is worth nothing in it &s;elf and which they don't know will ever procure him any Thing. And <HI>Rhode-I&s;land Bills of Credit</HI> have been &s;o far from being of certain Value and &s;ecuring to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or the Value that they were fir&s;t &s;tated at, that they have depreciated almo&s;t four &s;eventh Parts in nine Years la&s;t pa&s;t, as appears by their own Acts of A&s;&s;embly. For in the Year 1743, it appears by the Face of the Bills then emitted that <HI>Twenty-&s;even</HI> Shillings Old-Tenor was equal to one Ounce of Silver. And by an Act of their General A&s;&s;embly pa&s;s'd in <HI>March</HI> la&s;t, they &s;tated <HI>Fifty-four</HI> Shillings Old-Tenor Bills equal to one Ounce of Silver, which &s;unk their Value one half. And by another Act in <HI>June</HI> la&s;t, (viz. 1751) they &s;tated <HI>Sixty-four</HI> Shillings in their Old-Tenor Bills equal to one Ounce of Silver. And by another Act in <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> la&s;t they gave Order and Direction to the Courts in that Colony to make Allowance to the Creditors in making up Judg|ment from Time to Time as the Bills &s;hall depreciate for the Future, which &s;hows that they expect their <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> to depreciate for the Future. And &s;ince the Value of the <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> depend wholly on the Rate at which they are &s;tated and on the Credit of the Government by whom they are emitted and that being the only Rea&s;on and foundation upon which they obtained their fir&s;t Currency and by which the &s;ame has been upheld ever &s;ince their fir&s;t being current, and therefore when the Publick Faith and Credit of &s;uch Government is violated, then the Rea&s;on upon which &s;uch Bills obtained their Currency cea&s;es and there remains no Rea&s;on why they &s;hould be any longer current.</P>
<P>And this I would lay down as a Principle that can't be denied that a Debtor ought not to pay any Debts with
<PB N="7" REF="006933_0007_102a9b57cb06d0a0">
le&s;s Value than was contracted for, without the Con&s;ent or again&s;t the Will of the Creditor,</P>
<P>And the Creditor further &s;aith, that his accepting <HI>Rhode-I&s;land Bills of Credit</HI> when they &s;tood &s;tated equal to Silver at <HI>Twenty-&s;even</HI> Shillings an Ounce, can be no Rea&s;on that he &s;hould receive them at the &s;ame Value when they are &s;tated equal to Silver at <HI>Fifty-four</HI> Shillings an Ounce, and &s;till to receive them at the &s;ame Rate when they are &s;o reduced down that <HI>Sixty-four</HI> Shillings is equal to but one Ounce of Silver, and whoever does receive them &s;o mu&s;t not only act without, but again&s;t Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>And the Debtor can't po&s;&s;ibly plead without any Truth that he expected to pay in <HI>Rhode-I&s;land Bills of Credit</HI> at their pre&s;ent Value and under their pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances, (any Debts contracted before the afore&s;aid Act of <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> were publi&s;hed) becau&s;e there was no &s;uch Thing (as tho&s;e Bills are under their pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances) exi&s;ting at the Time of Contract, for as was ob&s;erv'd before, the Value of &s;uch <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> depend wholly upon the Rate at which they are &s;tated and on the Credit of the Govern|ment by whom they are emitted, and a <HI>Bill of Credit</HI> for the &s;ame Sum that is &s;tated equal to Silver at <HI>Twenty-&s;even</HI> Shillings an Ounce, mu&s;t be of more than double the Value of one &s;tated equal to Silver at <HI>Sixty four</HI> Shil|lings an Ounce if the Credit of the Emitter may be de|pended on: But if the Emitter's Credit can't be depended on then neither of the Bills afore&s;aid are of any Value, becau&s;e it is evident that no <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> have any Value in them&s;elves, but are given to &s;ecure &s;omething of intrin&s;ick Value, to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>So that the Arguments drawn from Cu&s;tom are of no Force, becau&s;e the Rea&s;ons upon which that Cu&s;tom were grounded do now cea&s;e.</P>
<P>I grant that if any Thing who&s;e Value is intrin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> invariable the &s;ame &s;hould obtain a Currency as a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>of Exchange</HI> for a great Number of Years in any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> it might with &s;ome Rea&s;on be urg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d that it ought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">
<PB N="8" REF="006933_0008_102a9b5adfb50cd8">
accepted in Payments for Debts where there is no &s;pecial Agreement for any other Species. But if what is us'd as a <HI>Medium of Exchange</HI> is fluctuating in its Value it is no better than unju&s;t Weights and Mea&s;ures, both which are condemn'd by the Laws of GOD and Man, and therefore the longe&s;t and mo&s;t univer&s;al Cu&s;tom could never make the U&s;e of &s;uch a <HI>Medium</HI> either lawful or rea&s;onable.</P>
<P>Now &s;uppo&s;e that Gold or Silver Coines that pa&s;s cur|rent in Payments at a certain Rate by Tale &s;hould have a con&s;iderable Part of their Weight filed or clipp'd off will any rea&s;onable Man judge that they ought to pa&s;s for the &s;ame Value as tho&s;e of full Weight. But the State of <HI>R&mdash;I&mdash;d Bills of Credit</HI> is much wor&s;e than that of Coins that are clipp'd, becau&s;e what is left of tho&s;e Coins is of intrin&s;ick Value: But the General A&s;&s;embly of <HI>R&mdash;I&mdash;d</HI> having depreciated their <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> have thereby violated their Promi&s;e from Time to Time, and there is ju&s;t Rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect their Credit for the Future for the &s;mall Value which they now promi&s;e for &s;aid Bills, and they have not only violated their Pro|mi&s;e as to the Value pretended to be &s;ecured to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or by &s;aid Bills; but al&s;o as to the Time of calling them in and paying the &s;ame, they having lengthened out the Time Fifteen Years. So that if the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or mu&s;t be kept out of the U&s;e of his Money until that Term is expired (and the Bills &s;ecure nothing to him &s;ooner.) One Ounce of Silver paid down now, would be worth more than <HI>Seven</HI> Pounds <HI>Ten</HI> Shillings in &s;uch <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> computing the Intere&s;t at 6 <HI>per Cent per Annum.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Things con&s;idered can, any rea&s;onable Man think that &s;uch <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> (or rather of no <HI>Credit</HI>) ought to be a legal Tender in Payment of Money in this Colony for Debts, for which the Debtor received Species of much more Value than tho&s;e Bills provided the Creditor could get the full Value of them in Silver that they are now &s;tated at. For it mu&s;t be remembred that
<PB N="9" REF="006933_0009_102a9b5d133b9580">
according to the State of the Ca&s;e now in Que&s;tion the Goods were charged according to the Value of Old-Tenor Bills of this Colony. Wherefore upon the whole it ap|pears that it would be evidently unju&s;t to impo&s;e <HI>Rhode-I&s;land Bills of Credit</HI> in payment for &s;uch a Debt, or any other in this Colony, unle&s;s the Creditor obliged him&s;elf by a &s;pecial Agreement to receive them in Pay|ment.</P>
<P>And if he had agreed to receive them in Payment for Debts contracted any Time between la&s;t <HI>March</HI> and <HI>June</HI> it would be unju&s;t to oblige him to take them without three Shillings on the Pound Allowance, for the General A&s;&s;embly of <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> depreciated them &s;o much in <HI>June</HI> below both their current and &s;tated Value in <HI>March</HI> preceding. And to oblige People to receive them with|out &s;uch Allowance in this Colony; would be, to be more di&s;hone&s;t than they are in <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> Colony for they are obliged by Law to make Allowance for the De|preciation. But in as much as we are not under the Juri&s;diction of <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> Government and therefore can take no Benefit by their equitable Acts, I &s;uppo&s;e that according to the Rules of the Law, upon a Contract made in this Colony for the Payment of <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> on the Colo|ny of <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> or any of the neighbouring Governments. If the Debtor could not procure &s;uch Bills under the &s;ame Circum&s;tances that they were at the Time of Con|tract, the Courts would a&s;&s;e&s;s Damages for <HI>Connecticut</HI> Money, according to the Value of &s;uch Bills at the Time of Contract. And the Rea&s;on is, becau&s;e if on the one Hand all &s;uch Bills &s;hould be called in and burnt between the Time of Contract and the Time of Payment it would be unrea&s;onable to oblige the Debtor to an impo&s;&s;ibility, and on the other Hand if there &s;hould between the Time of Contract and the Time of Payment be an Act pa&s;s'd that all &s;uch Bills &s;hould be brought into the Trea&s;urer to be redeemd' by a certain Time or el&s;e be Outlawed and rendered of no Value and that Time &s;hould be expired
<PB N="10" REF="006933_0010_102a9b60815d1f00">
before the Time of Payment, or if by an Act of A&s;&s;em|bly they &s;hould be depreciated and &s;unk one half or two third in their Value, it would be unrea&s;onable that the Creditor &s;hould be thereby defrauded of his ju&s;t Due and lo&s;e &s;o much of his E&s;tate.</P>
<P>But to impo&s;e <HI>Rhode-I&s;land Bills of Credit</HI> in Payments for Debts in this Colony when the Creditor never agreed to take them, and that without any Allowance for the Deprecia|tion, would be to take away Men's E&s;tates and wrong them of their ju&s;t and righteous Dues without either Law or Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>And in&s;tead of having our Properties defended and &s;e|cured to us by the Protection of the Government under which we live; we &s;hould be always expo&s;ed to have them taken from us by Fraud at the Plea&s;ure of other Governments, who have no Right of Juri&s;diction over us. And according to this Argument, if <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> General A&s;&s;embly had been plea&s;ed la&s;t <HI>June</HI> to have &s;tated their Old-Tenor Bills equal to Silver at <HI>Forty-eight</HI> Pounds <HI>Twelve</HI> Shillings an Ounce, in&s;tead of <HI>Sixty-four</HI> Shillings, and &s;o have cut off the Value of them <HI>Eighteen</HI> Shillings on the Pound, in&s;tead of <HI>Three</HI> Shillings, all Creditors in this Colony would thereby have been nece&s;&s;itated to lo&s;e <HI>Ninety</HI> Pounds out of every <HI>Hundred</HI> Pounds of their Debts which were then out &s;tanding, for if they could take away one Sixth Part of their Value and reduce them &s;o much below the Old-Tenor Bills of this Colony and the Creditor be notwith&s;tanding obliged to receive them with|out any Allowance, by the &s;ame Rule they might have taken away three Quarters or Nine Tenths or in|deed the whole, and the Creditor have had no more Remedy than he has now. And the E&s;tates of poor Widows and Orphans mu&s;t according to this Principle in the &s;ame unju&s;t Manner be taken away from them and given to others that have no Right to them, (for what the Creditor lo&s;es in this way the Debtor gains becau&s;e the more the <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> depreciate the le&s;s Value the Debtor can procure them for) and according to the Debtor's
<PB N="11" REF="006933_0011_102a9b62e840c388">
Argument the Executive Courts in this Colony mu&s;t give Judgment in Favour of all this Fraud and Iniquity at lea&s;t, 'till there is &s;ome &s;pecial Act of A&s;&s;embly to order them to the contrary; but I believe that every hone&s;t Man of common Sen&s;e, upon mature Con&s;ideration of the Circum&s;tances of the Ca&s;e, will think that this is an Iniquity not to be countenanced, but rather to be puni&s;hed by the Judges.</P>
<P>But in An&s;wer to what is &s;aid concerning Demands being made for Old-Tenor Money indifferently and the Courts giving Judgment accordingly. The Creditor &s;aith that Phra&s;e in all Demands made in this Colony ought to be under&s;tood to be the Old-Tenor Money of this Colony, and no other, for there never was any Law in this Colony that <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> on the neighbouring Governments &s;hould be a legal Tender in Payments of Money, and I have ob&s;erved before that it would be un|rea&s;onable, that any &s;uch Foreign Currency &s;hould be im|po&s;ed as Money, and the &s;ame Phra&s;e is us'd in taxing Bills of Co&s;t in the Executive Courts, but it is under&s;tood to be the Old-Tenor Money of this Colony only, for a <HI>Thou&s;and</HI> Pounds in <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> on the neighbouring Governments would not be &s;ufficient in the Law to &s;atisfy a Bill of Co&s;t of <HI>Twenty</HI> Shillings Old-Tenor.</P>
<P>&rindx; And the General A&s;&s;embly of this Colony have &s;uf|ficiently declared that they don't E&s;teem &s;uch <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> as Money, and that no Per&s;on ought to be obliged to receive them as &s;uch. In that, they them&s;elves will not receive them for their Wages neither do they oblige any other Per&s;on who&s;e Fees or Wages are &s;tated by Law to receive them, but have made Provi&s;ion how they &s;hall be paid exclu&s;ive of &s;uch Bills. And as to the Objection that they have been receiv'd in Payment to &s;atisfy all Judgments given as afore|&s;aid, the Creditor &s;aith, that it was only by the voluntary Con&s;ent of the Receiver, but there is not the &s;ame Rea&s;ons that they &s;hould be received now at the &s;ame Value as <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> on this Colony that there was formerly becau&s;e it is evident that there is now a real Difference in
<PB N="12" REF="006933_0012_102a9b65c1b076f0">
their Values. For by a Law of the Province of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;ets-Bay,</HI> their Bills of Old-Tenor are &s;tated equal to Silver at <HI>Fifty</HI> Shillings an Ounce and <HI>Seven</HI> Shillings and <HI>Six</HI> Pence are equal to <HI>One</HI> Shilling Proclamation Money, and the Executive Courts in this Colony reckon <HI>Eight</HI> Shillings Old-Tenor Bills of this Colony equal to <HI>One</HI> Shil|ling Proclamation Money which is equal to Silver at <HI>Fifty-four</HI> Shillings Old-Tenor an Ounce. And by an Act of <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> General A&s;&s;embly <HI>Sixty-four</HI> Shillings of their Old-Tenor Bills is &s;tated equal to one Ounce of Silver, at which Rate <HI>Nine</HI> Shillings and <HI>Six</HI> Pence is equal to but <HI>One</HI> Shillings Proclamation Money, whereas three Years ago the Bills of Old-Tenor on all the three Governments afore&s;aid were of equal Value.</P>
<P>And &s;ince it appears, that there is &s;uch a Difference in the &s;tated Value of the afore&s;aid <HI>Bills of Credit,</HI> no Man can with any Propriety be &s;aid to make them all without Di&s;tinction, a Standard to value Things by; for a Man could afford to &s;ell any Goods or Merchandize for a le&s;s Sum in Old-Tenor Bills of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets-Bay,</HI> than for the Old-Tenor Bills of this Colony and he could afford to &s;ell Goods for a le&s;s Sum by 15 <HI>per Cent</HI> for the Old-Tenor Bills of this Colony, than for the Old-Tenor Bills on <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> Colony.</P>
<P>And to &s;ay that an Accompt is charged in Old-Tenor Money indifferently of this and the neighbouring Govern|ments, is to &s;ay that 7<HI>s.</HI>-6<HI>d.</HI> and 8<HI>s.</HI> and 9<HI>s.</HI>-6<HI>d.</HI> are one and the &s;ame Sum, or that there is no Difference between <HI>Fifty</HI> and <HI>Fifty-four,</HI> or between <HI>Fifty-four</HI> and <HI>Sixty-four</HI> Q. E. D.</P>
<P>And &s;ince it appears that it would be evidently ab&s;urd to make a Demand for Old-Tenor Money indifferently of this and the neighbouring Governments, it follows that all Demands made for Old-Tenor Money in this Colony mu&s;t be for the Money of this Colony exclu&s;ive of the Old-Tenor of the neighbouring Governments, or el&s;e for the
<PB N="13" REF="006933_0013_102a9b6773fb4bf8">
Old-Tenor Money of &s;ome one of the other Governments exclu&s;ive of the Old-Tenor of this and the re&s;t.</P>
<P>And &s;ince nothing but a &s;pecial Contract can intitle any Per&s;on to demand the Money of any other Govern|ment, for a Debt contracted and demanded in this Colony: It nece&s;&s;sarily follows, that all Demands for Debts due by Book, where the Contract lyes at large mu&s;t be for the Money of this Colony only.</P>
<P>What I would be under&s;tood to mean by Old-Tenor Money of the Colony of <HI>Connecticut</HI> is, what&s;oever is e&s;tabli&s;hed by Law in &s;aid Colony to pa&s;s, as or in Lieu of Money, rated according to its Value in Old-Tenor Bills on &s;aid Colony, and I &s;uppo&s;e that the Words (Old-Tenor) when us'd in Contracts are univer&s;ally <HI>under&s;tood</HI> to be intended only to a&s;&s;ertain the Value of the Sum to which they are affixed and they mu&s;t be &s;o under&s;tood when the Executive Courts tax Bills of Co&s;t in Old-Tenor Money, for they have no Right neither do they mean to exclude Bills of the New-Tenor, or any of tho&s;e Coins e&s;tabli&s;hed by Law (to pa&s;s in Payment for Fees) from being a &s;ufficient Tender in Payment of &s;uch Co&s;ts.</P>
<P>And now I have gone through with what I fir&s;t propo&s;ed. But perhaps &s;ome, may be ready to &s;ay, <HI>that we are &s;en&s;ible that it is of bad Con&s;equence to have a fluctuating Me|dium of Exchange, but what can be done to Remedy it?</HI></P>
<P>I an&s;wer take away the Cau&s;e, and the Effect will nece&s;|&s;arily cea&s;e.</P>
<P>But it may be further objected, that if it were not for the <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> on the neighbouring Governments, we &s;hould have no Money to Trade with, and what &s;hould we do for a <HI>Medium of Exchange?</HI> or how could we live without?</P>
<P>To this I an&s;wer, that if that were indeed the Ca&s;e, we had better die in a good Cau&s;e than live in a bad one. But I apprehend that the Ca&s;e in Fact is quite the rever&s;e, for we in this Colony are &s;eated on a very fruitful Soil,
<PB N="14" REF="006933_0014_102a9b6ac754d8a8">
the Product whereof, with our Labour and Indu&s;try, and the Divine Ble&s;&s;ing thereon, would &s;ufficiently furni&s;h us with, and procure us all the Nece&s;&s;aries of Life and as good a <HI>Medium of Exchange</HI> as any People in the World have or can de&s;ire. But &s;o long as we part with our mo&s;t valuable Commodities for &s;uch <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> as are no Profit; but rather a Cheat, Vexation and Snare to us, and become a <HI>Medium</HI> whereby we are continu|ally cheating and wronging one another in our Dealings and Commerce. And &s;o long as we import &s;o much more foreign Goods than are nece&s;&s;ary, and keep &s;o many Merchants and Traders employed to procure and deal them out to us: Great Part of which, we might as well make among our&s;elves; and another great Part of which, we had much better be without, e&s;pecially the Spiritous Liquors of which va&s;t Quantities are con&s;umed in this Colony every Year, unnece&s;&s;arily to the great De&s;truction of the E&s;tates, Morals, Health and even the Lives of many of the Inhabitants.</P>
<P>I &s;ay &s;o long as the&s;e Things are &s;o we &s;hall &s;pend great Part of our Labour and Sub&s;tance for that, which will not profit us. Whereas if the&s;e Things were re|formed, the Provi&s;ions and other Commodities which we might have to export yearly, and which other Govern|ments are dependant upon us for, would procure us Gold and Silver abundently &s;ufficient for a <HI>Medium</HI> of Trade. And we might be as independent, flouri&s;hing and happy a Colony as any in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Dominions.</P>
<P>And with Submi&s;&s;ion I would humbly beg Leave to propo&s;e it to the wi&s;e Con&s;ideration of the Honourable General A&s;&s;embly of this Colony; whether it would not be conducive to the welfare of the Colony to pa&s;s &s;ome Act to prevent the Bills la&s;t emitted by <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> Colony from obtaining a Currency among us. And to appoint &s;ome rea&s;onable Time (not exceeding the Term that our <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> are allowed to pa&s;s) after the Expiration of which none of the <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> on <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="006933_0015_102a9b6d2845bcf8" MS="y">
or <HI>Rhode-I&s;land,</HI> &s;hall be allowed to pa&s;s in this Colony, that &s;o People having previous Notice thereof may order their Affairs &s;o as to get rid of each Bills to the be&s;t Advantage that they can before the Expiration of &s;uch Term.</P>
<P>And whether it would not be very much for the Pub|lick Good to lay a large Exci&s;e upon all Rum imported in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> this Colony or di&s;tilled herein, thereby effectually to re&s;train the exce&s;&s;ive u&s;e thereof, which is &s;uch a growing Evil among us and is leading to almo&s;t all other Vices. And I doubt not but that if tho&s;e two great Evils that have been mentioned were re&s;trained we &s;hould &s;oon &s;ee better Times.</P>
