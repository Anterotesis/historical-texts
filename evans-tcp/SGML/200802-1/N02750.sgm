<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>OUR former Intimacy at the Univer&s;i|ties in <HI>Holland</HI> and Ho&s;pitals in <HI>Flanders,</HI> inclined me to this Addre&s;s. The Station which you have acquired by your Merit, being one of the highe&s;t which our <HI>Profe&s;&s;ion</HI> admits of, I mean of being <HI>a Court Phy&s;ician,</HI> &s;eems naturally to demand it, even at this di&s;tance. But more e&s;pecial|ly your knowledge in this Affair or Subject, obliges me to &s;ubmit this Practical E&s;&s;ay upon the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> to your better Judg|ment.</P>
<P>My former Inclinations to &s;everal branches of <HI>Natural Hi&s;tory,</HI> I have now contracted to that of <HI>Medical Ca&s;es</HI>; more particular|ly
<PB N="ii" REF="003275_0004_0FF0305ED90FE0D8">
I continue to make Ob&s;ervations concern|ing the <HI>Endemial Di&s;tempers</HI> of this Coun|try and Climate, e&s;pecially of a certain Ano|malous ill-conditioned <HI>Autumnal Fever</HI> which &s;ometimes galls us much. In the Year <HI>1721.</HI> after an ab&s;ence of about twenty years, the <HI>Small Pox</HI> rendred this large and populous Town of <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> in <HI>New-England</HI> a meer Ho&s;pital; &s;uch Opportunities are &s;eldom to be met with in <HI>Europe,</HI> and there being no like|lihood of &s;uch another as to Numbers and Varieties in this Country in my Time; I &s;ecluded my &s;elf from all other Company but that of my Patients during the Small Pox Illne&s;s, and committed to writing for my own remini&s;cence and private u&s;e, the remarkable Small Pox Ca&s;es which occurred in a very exten&s;ive Practice. This la&s;t Summer after fifteen years ab&s;cence, the <HI>Mea&s;les</HI> prevailed here, which afforded me a very extraordinary Opportunity of ob&s;erving the Varieties which attend that Di&s;temper.</P>
<P>It is the duty of <HI>a Man,</HI> in times of any publick Calamity, to lend a helping hand, as his Station, Profe&s;&s;ion or Capacity may enable him: This induced me at this time, when the <HI>Small Pox</HI> begins to annoy the Town a|gain,

to reduce into &s;ome Method, the Ob|&s;ervations I made concerning the <HI>Small Pox</HI> in <HI>Bo&s;ton 1721.</HI> with what other know|ledge I formerly had of this Di&s;temper. <HI>Ob&s;ervations</HI> reduced to Method and Ana|logy from thence is all we know or can learn in any Di&s;temper. I have candidly and with|out re&s;erve imparted all that I know of this Di&s;ea&s;e, &s;o far as can be reduced to writing in a &s;hort Ab&s;tract. I have by choice ex|pre&s;&s;ed &s;ome few things in the Words of &s;ome Celebrated Practitioners, rather than in my own. To have in&s;erted <HI>Formulas</HI> of Medi|cines would be trifling, they are &s;oon conceiv|ed where the Indications and Intentions are known. I de&s;igned to have inter&s;per&s;ed <HI>Hi&s;|tories</HI> of remarkable Ca&s;es, by way of <HI>Prac|tical Illu&s;trations</HI>; but the nature of an Ab|&s;tract does not give room, and more e&s;pecially being recent, mo&s;t of the Subjects alive in the place, I was afraid it might not be &s;o agree|able, as certainly it would have been u&s;eful.</P>

<HEAD>A Practical E&s;&s;ay Concerning the Small Pox.</HEAD>
<P>WHERE the <HI>prima &s;tamina Vitae</HI> are good, the whole Affair of <HI>Health and long Life</HI> would con&s;i&s;t in <HI>Temperance and moderate Exerci&s;e,</HI> were it not for &s;ome <HI>malignant acute Di&s;ea&s;es</HI> which have &s;omething <HI>My&s;terious</HI> in their Nature, invading the healthy and Vala|tudinarians indifferently: Of tho&s;e &s;ome are <HI>En|demial,</HI> peculiar to Countries, Climates, Sea&s;ons, and Con&s;titutions of the Air; but <HI>not communica|ble</HI> by Infection from Man to Man: Mo&s;t Coun|tries have at times <HI>Fevers</HI> of this kind, in this and the neighbouring Colonies, e&s;pecially in the Au|tumn we are afflicted with a certain <HI>febris mali moris,</HI> not reducible to any Cla&s;&s;ical Name of Fe|vers
<PB N="2" REF="003275_0007_0FF0306534E6A5F8">
de&s;cribed by Authors. It begins as all Fevers do with <HI>Horripulations</HI> &amp;c. has no perfect Inter|mi&s;&s;ions, but, without any more horrors, <HI>remi&s;&s;i|ons and exacerbations</HI> &s;ometimes periodical but more frequently uncertain, the Symptoms are va|rious, being the mo&s;t <HI>anomalous Fever</HI> that ever came to my knowledge; the mo&s;t general Symp|tom is <HI>oppre&s;&s;io gravitativa circa cordis regionem,</HI> which the Patients expre&s;s by a pain at their Hearts, and in all Fevers except the Eruptive is reckoned a Symptom <HI>mali Ominis.</HI></P>
<P>Some <HI>malignant Fevers</HI> altho' originally <HI>Ende|mial</HI> or the produce of Climates Sea&s;ons <HI>&amp;c.</HI> may by <HI>Infection</HI> be &s;pread at home, and in &s;ome Con|&s;titutions of the Air, may be conveyed and di&s;|&s;eminated in Countries abroad where they are not natives but <HI>Exoticks,</HI> and therefore cannot thrive &s;o well there as in their native Soil. Thus the <HI>Plague</HI> Endemial in the <HI>Levant</HI> and <HI>Egypt,</HI> does &s;ometimes get &s;ooting in <HI>Europe</HI> (I cannot learn that it ever vi&s;ited the <HI>American</HI> Continent) it was in <HI>London</HI> from 1602 to 1648, every Year there died a few of it, but did not &s;pread except|ing 1603, 1625 and 1636; ever &s;ince the Year 1665 notwith&s;tanding a continued Trade to the <HI>Levant,</HI> it has not taken root in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Small Pox</HI> is a Di&s;ea&s;e of a more <HI>&s;ingular na|ture,</HI> it is of a very uncertain Original, we know of no Country where it is a Native or <HI>Endemial,</HI> that is, where it is the produce of Sea&s;ons, Winds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as is the Plague in the <HI>Levant.</HI> It owes the continuation of its being to a <HI>variolous leaven</HI> com|municable in all Countries and Sea&s;ons, but &s;ome Con&s;titutions of Years favour its propagation and mortality more or le&s;s; from the <HI>London</HI> Bills of Mortality there died there of the <HI>Small Pox</HI> 1702 only 31, in the Year 1706 died 721, in the Year

1719 dies 3229. There is another <HI>Circum&s;tance very &s;ingular</HI> in its Nature, that it never affects a Per&s;on oftner than once; in the <HI>Plague</HI> &s;ome have died in the 2d, 3d, 4th <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Sei&s;ure, as Dr. <HI>Hod|ges</HI> informs us: It is therefore an Infection e&s;&s;en|tially different from the <HI>Pe&s;tilential,</HI> and cannot be the Effect of &s;ome ancient violent <HI>Plague in Egypt,</HI> as &s;ome Authors &s;urmi&s;e.</P>
<P>We are beholden to the <HI>Arabians</HI> or <HI>Saracens,</HI> not only for many <HI>Drugs and Medicines,</HI> as <HI>the Purging Rhubarb, Manna, Mercurial Unguents, the Epi&s;pa&s;tick U&s;e of the Cantharides,</HI> &amp;c. but al&s;o for the fir&s;t Accounts we have of &s;everal Di&s;ea&s;es, as <HI>Small Pox, Mea&s;les, Lepra Arabum, Spina vento&s;a. Vena Medini,</HI> or <HI>Guinea Worm,</HI> &amp;c. The <HI>Small Pox</HI> was a Stranger in Medicine until the Time that the <HI>Arabians</HI> or <HI>Saracens</HI> &s;ettled in <HI>Egypt,</HI> which was &s;oon after <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Death. As this People in le&s;s than 30 Years did va&s;tly propagate their <HI>Religion and Empire,</HI> &s;o they did the <HI>Small Pox</HI> in a &s;hort Time, and might Introduce it in|to <HI>Europe</HI> by Way of <HI>Spain,</HI> where they &s;ettled powerful Colonies. The various <HI>Exanthemata</HI> of the <HI>Greeks,</HI> and <HI>Pu&s;tulae</HI> of the <HI>Romans,</HI> with other <HI>Eruptive Fevers</HI> mentioned by them, were no ways analagous to the <HI>Small Pox</HI>: At the Di&s;covery of this Continent of <HI>America,</HI> not the lea&s;t Re&s;em|blance of it was to be found.</P>
<P>The <HI>Small Pox</HI> is an <HI>Inflammatory Fever,</HI> but with a peculiar Malignancy or Poi&s;on; which requires the Indications of Cure to be taken principally <HI>ae juvantibus &amp; laedentibus.</HI> Inflammations, as purely &s;uch, require <HI>U. S.</HI> and the Body to be kept &s;olu|ble; but in the <HI>Small Pox</HI> the Body ought to be bound; and Dr. <HI>Sydenham</HI> gives us an In&s;tance of a young Man, who, notwith&s;tanding he had &s;ome &s;hort Time before Sei&s;ure been frequently let Blood

for <HI>Rheumatick</HI> Pains, had the wor&s;t Sort of conflu|ent <HI>Small Pox</HI> he ever did &s;ee. In &s;ome Families, by a <HI>jus haereditarium,</HI> it is always very <HI>malignant,</HI> or fatal; thus Mrs. <HI>A</HI>&mdash; and her Daughter, Capt. <HI>R</HI>&mdash;'s Wife and her Child, two Children of <HI>F</HI>&mdash; a Fi&s;herman, two Boys at <HI>L</HI>&mdash; Cou&s;in Germans, all died with Purples and Haemorrhages, Mr. <HI>W</HI>&mdash; and his Si&s;ter died in the Innoculated Way: To other Families it is always favourable; Dr. <HI>Morton</HI> &s;ays, that he could not recollect, that any Per&s;on of his own or his Wife's Family ever died of the <HI>Small Pox.</HI> We find by Experience, that a <HI>confluent,</HI> or very: full Knid, does not always pro|ceed from a more inten&s;e Inflammation of the Blood, or from driving by Cordials: Frequently it is in the Nature of the Per&s;on's <HI>Con&s;titution</HI> to be &s;o affected with the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> having very lit|tle of a Fever, no Phrenzy, Coma, or any other violent Symptom; but meerly from a too profu&s;e <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">puration,</HI> to die of a <HI>tabid Inanition,</HI> in all Sta|ges of Life; thus died <HI>J. B</HI>&mdash; <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> an old Man, <HI>W. H</HI>&mdash; <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> a middle aged Man, <HI>W. S</HI>&mdash; a young Lad, <HI>M. G</HI>&mdash; Hou&s;ekeeper, a young Woman who&s;e Eruptions were too early after <HI>Inoculation.</HI> Further we may ob&s;erve, that any violent Symp|tom proceeding from an <HI>accidental Error,</HI> is not of that bad Con&s;equence as if it did proceed from the <HI>Con&s;titution</HI> in the natural Cour&s;e of the Di|&s;temper: Thus the Purples in <HI>J. C</HI>&mdash; at 19, were from <HI>violent Exerci&s;e,</HI> in running after Cattle in the Country a few Days before Sei&s;ure; Capt. <HI>T</HI>&mdash;'s Negro Man in a Confluent Sort, had <HI>bloody Urine,</HI> having lately received a Blow cro&s;s his Loins; Capt. <HI>H</HI>&mdash;'s Son, aet 5, had inter&s;per&s;ed <HI>Ve&s;icules</HI> full of a &s;harp <HI>blewi&s;h Serum,</HI> from an inten&s;e <HI>hot Regimen</HI>; they could not have &s;urvived the&s;e Symptoms if they had been <HI>Con&s;titutional.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="003275_0010_0FF0306E41467E08">Mo&s;t <HI>malignant Di&s;tempers</HI> have their <HI>Cri&s;is</HI> in the Glands; the <HI>Plague</HI> in the Inguinal, Axillary, and Parotidal Glands; the <HI>Small Pox</HI> in the Miliary Glands of the Skin. The <HI>Cau&s;tick</HI> acrimonious Quality of the <HI>Small Pox</HI> Infection is evident from the Pittings. That this Malignity is <HI>colliquative</HI> appears by the profu&s;e Sweatings or Diarrhaeas in &s;ome, in others Salivation, Swellings of Face, Ex|tremities, <HI>Scroti &amp; Preputii,</HI> Diabetical <HI>Profluviums,</HI> Purples and <HI>Haemorrhages.</HI> The <HI>Small Pox</HI> &s;eldom arrives to that Degree of Malignity, as to be at|tended with &s;udden Death; there were but two In&s;tances came to my Knowledge here, being both young Women, and <HI>died before Eruption,</HI> by a vi|olent <HI>Necro&s;is</HI> of their Spirits, inten&s;e <HI>Coma</HI> and <HI>Stupor.</HI></P>
<P>The Cure of a <HI>Fever</HI> in the fir&s;t Intention is by &s;ome <HI>Specifick</HI> to extingui&s;h it, without allowing it to come to a <HI>Cri&s;is</HI>; becau&s;e <HI>Cri&s;is's</HI> are frequently precarious: So that the Cure of the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> properly &s;peaking, is &s;o to manage the infecting <HI>Mia&s;ma</HI> in the fir&s;t Period or <HI>Apparatus</HI> of the Di&s;ea&s;e, that it &s;hall not come to <HI>Eruption,</HI> i. e. Suppuration, with a tedious Train of Symptoms; thus if a Prickle or Splinter is lodged in the Finger, the proper direct Cure is <HI>Extraction,</HI> whereby Suppuration, Ulceration, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are prevented. If we could find an Antidote to de&s;troy the <HI>Small Pox</HI> Infection in <HI>Embrio,</HI> it would be a genuine <HI>&s;pecifick</HI> Cure; we cannot &s;ay it is impo&s;&s;ible, but hitherto it is not di&s;covered to Mankind; may it be the Happine&s;s of future Ages.</P>
<P>Next to a &s;pecifick Cure, would be <HI>a Method to alleviate</HI> the <HI>Cri&s;is,</HI> as to the Quantity and de|leterious Nature of the Inflammations and Suppu|rations. The <HI>Circa&s;&s;ian</HI> Method of procuring the <HI>Small Pox</HI> by <HI>variolous Pus,</HI> applied externally to

fre&s;h cutaneous Inci&s;ions, lately introduced in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and <HI>New England,</HI> &s;eems to bid the fair|e&s;t for this; but it is not an ab&s;olute certain Re|medy again&s;t a bad Sort. Much of the &s;ame Na|ture is what Dr. <HI>Williams</HI> of <HI>Haverfordwe&s;t,</HI> &s;ays, has been an imimemorial Cu&s;tom in &s;ome Parts of <HI>Wales,</HI> called, <HI>buying of the Small Pox.</HI> The Per&s;on procures a few <HI>fre&s;h Pocky Scabs,</HI> and holds them in the Hollow of the Hand a con&s;iderable Time; about 10 or 12 Days thereafter the Per&s;on &s;ickens, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> An old Midwife, <HI>Jane Jones,</HI> aged 70, told him, that &s;he knew it practi&s;ed at Times above 50 Years, and knows but one dying of the Di&s;temper &s;o com|municated. Con&s;idering the Ca&s;es of &s;everal of my Patients who had at the Time <HI>I&s;&s;ues,</HI> I was very inclinable to think, that by their Vent they did contribute towards alleviating the Di&s;temper, par|ticularly in <HI>Children</HI> abounding with <HI>gro&s;s Humours,</HI> or Faeculencies. <HI>Mercurialis</HI> &s;ays that he ob&s;erv'd few to die of the <HI>Plague</HI> who ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> I&s;&s;ues running.</P>
<P>What is commonly called, <HI>the Cure of the Small Pox</HI> at pre&s;ent, is only from the Experience of the <HI>juvantia &amp; laedentia,</HI> to prevent, alleviate, or re|move the various di&s;turbing <HI>Symptoms</HI> in the &s;everal Periods of this Di&s;ea&s;e. Formerly Practitioners were zealou&s;ly bigotted, &s;ome to a <HI>cool Regimen,</HI> others to a <HI>hot Method,</HI> reckoning the oppo&s;ite Practice of pernicious Con&s;equence. That the Patient ought to be kept in a <HI>moderate natural Temper</HI> as near as can be, we learn from Experi|ence. We find that Nature performs her Office be&s;t in a moderate Sea&s;on; Heat di&s;&s;ipates, and Cold depre&s;&s;es the Spirits too much.</P>
<P>For the <HI>cool Regimen,</HI> Dr. <HI>Sydenham,</HI> ever to be celebrated for his Diligence in ob&s;erving, and Can|dor in communicating, was a great Stickler, e&s;pe|cially in the former Years of his Practice, and has
<PB N="7" REF="003275_0012_0FF03072E6E4C1B0" MS="y">
been much blamed on that Head; but after more Years Experience, he was not &s;o rigorous in this Method; and &s;ays, that after the <HI>Eruption com|pleated,</HI> the Patient ought to be kept <HI>clo&s;e a-bed,</HI> not &s;o much as to expo&s;e an Arm or Hand, that by the agreeable and mild Heat of the Bed, the Plumpne&s;s of the <HI>Pu&s;tules</HI> may be kept up, as al&s;o the Swellings of Face and Hands. He con&s;idered it chiefly as an <HI>Inflammatory Di&s;ea&s;e,</HI> and he &s;up|po&s;ed the <HI>Confluent,</HI> and other Bad Kinds, pro|ceeded from the Fever a&s;&s;imulating and expelling of too much <HI>variolo&s;e</HI> Matter. I never ob&s;erv'd any Benefit, but frequently Hurt, by expo&s;ing the Pa|tients to the <HI>Air colder</HI> than the natural Temper of the Body required. I remember &s;ome Ca&s;es, where in the Eruption being <HI>expo&s;ed to the Cold,</HI> it was <HI>check'd</HI> for &s;ome Time; but &s;oon after follow|ed a <HI>&s;econd Crop</HI> generally mortal We find by Ex|perience, that <HI>Intermitting Fevers,</HI> and &s;uch conti|nued ones as are allied to them, are <HI>protracted</HI> by a cold Regimen. In other Di&s;ea&s;es we may ob|&s;erve, that <HI>Coolers &s;o retard</HI> the Circulation, that there may ari&s;e a Sort of Ferment from Stag|nation; and in&s;tead of allaying Heat, may change a <HI>&s;imple Inflammatory Fever,</HI> di&s;po&s;ed to a <HI>Diapho|re&s;is,</HI> into a <HI>putrid</HI> and malignant one. In the <HI>Small Pox</HI> the more <HI>per&s;pirable</HI> the Body, (I do not mean Sweating, which is a Colliquation) the better; thus we find, the Face, Neck, Arms and Hands, being continually expo&s;ed to the Air, are <HI>indura|ted,</HI> and &s;uffer mo&s;t from the <HI>Small Pox.</HI> Extreme <HI>cold</HI> Weather is bad in all <HI>Eruptive Fevers</HI>: In 1713, the <HI>Mea&s;les</HI> raged here in the <HI>Winter,</HI> and there died about 150 Per&s;ons; in 1729, it prevailed in the <HI>Summer,</HI> and there died only about 15.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Hot Regimen,</HI> Dr. <HI>Morton</HI> and others al|ledge, that &s;ome Part of the <HI>Virulency remaining
<PB N="8" REF="003275_0013_0FF030746F6E1318">
not protruded</HI> to the Surface of the Body, was the Rea&s;on of the <HI>Lucta,</HI> and Fever, and other Symp|toms &s;till continuing; and that this <HI>Languor</HI> of Nature <HI>protracts</HI> the Periods of Maturation and De&s;quammation to many Days; and therefore, the more malignant, the more generous <HI>Alexiphar|micks</HI> are by them admini&s;tred; thus by a <HI>hot Method,</HI> they inadvertently con&s;pire with a mo&s;t inflammatory Di&s;temper to kill the Patient; the formerly received Notion of <HI>Alexipharmicks</HI> being <HI>Antidotes</HI> to Malignity, has by a dangerous vulgar Error, in violent <HI>inflammatory Ca&s;es,</HI> &s;ent many prematurely to their cold Graves. I ob&s;erv'd in the mo&s;t malignant <HI>Small Pox</HI> with Purples and Haemorrhages, they immediately and mo&s;t notori|ou&s;ly multiplied the&s;e Symptoms, and &s;oon procu|red an <HI>Exit. E. G</HI>&mdash; aet. 18, by generous <HI>Alex|ipharmicks,</HI> had his Purples <HI>multiplied</HI> to Millions, with inflated purpli&s;h Eyelids, and bloody faetid Stools, <HI>expired &s;oon,</HI> before the Eruption was com|pleat. Capt. <HI>B</HI>&mdash;'s Child, <HI>aet.</HI> 8, having Purples, by this Method, the <HI>Blood was forced thro' the Pores</HI> of the Skin under the No&s;e, on the Lips, and Corners of the Eyes; with many others I could mention. <HI>Cordial Spirits and Volatiles</HI> in all Fevers pu&s;h Nature <HI>precipitately</HI> to a <HI>Cri&s;is,</HI> and be&s;ides other Inconveniencies, their natural Tendency be|ing to the <HI>Brain,</HI> they &s;olicite along with them|&s;elves the Violence of the Di&s;ea&s;e, occa&s;ioning <HI>Phrenzies, Delirias, Comas,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>It would be tedious to in&s;ert here the <HI>general Methods of Cure</HI> which have been u&s;ed by the mo&s;t celebrated Practitioners. Dr. <HI>Sydenham,</HI> by a cool Regimen, by acidulating all their Drinks with <HI>Sp. Vitriol.</HI> which he calls a Specifick in this Di&s;tem|per, and by Paragoricks at Night, managed his Pa|tients. Dr. <HI>Pitcairn</HI> lets Blood where there is
<PB N="9" REF="003275_0014_0FF030770241E180">

<P>In the <HI>accidental Contagion,</HI> from Infection re|ceived to Sickening, are 18 to 21 Days; from Ob&s;ervations which I made in &s;everal Families; and as to the Town in general, we may recol|lect, that about the Middle of <HI>June,</HI> 1721, E|ruptions appearing in many Hou&s;es, the Watches which had been appointed to prevent its Spread|ing,
<PB N="10" REF="003275_0015_0FF0307A958BB770">
were di&s;continued; in the next Parcel of De|cumbents, the Eruptions appeared about the 7th and 8th of <HI>July</HI>; and in the End of <HI>July,</HI> and Beginning of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> it &s;pread much. The Change and Full of the <HI>Moon</HI> may more or le&s;s <HI>di&s;po&s;e</HI> Bo|dies to receive the Infection; but Sickening and Eruptions do happen in all Times of the Moon: In Southerly clo&s;e Weather the Infection is mo&s;t &s;u&s;ceptible.

<P>There are <HI>va&s;t Varieties of the genuine</HI> Small Pox; but in general, <HI>the &s;ooner</HI> the &s;everal <HI>Stadia</HI> are accompli&s;hed, the <HI>more benign</HI>; and mo&s;t fre|quently, the <HI>Danger</HI> is in Proportion to the <HI>Num|ber of the Pu&s;tules</HI>: There are &s;ome Exceptions were a Di&s;tinct Sort has been very malignant, and even attended with Purples, Mr. <HI>F </HI>&mdash;'s <HI>Indian Peter,</HI> &amp;c.

<P>To form <HI>a general Idea of this Di&s;temper,</HI> we mu&s;t take the <HI>di&s;tinct plump Kind as a Standard.</HI> It may be de&s;cribed thus; begins with the com|mon Symptoms of a Fever, but more particular|ly is attended with <HI>Pain in the Head, Back and Loins, and about the Region of the Stomach, weep|ing Eyes, Sore Throat. Vomitings, Do&s;edne&s;s, Startings, and in Children &s;ometimes Convul&s;ions.

dige&s;ted Pus,</HI> 10<HI>th they begin to cru&s;t or &s;cab,</HI> 12<HI>th they are dry Scabs, and Appetite returned.</HI></P>
<P>We may comprehend all the <HI>Varieties of</HI> Small Pox under the&s;e. 1. <HI>A di&s;tinct dry Sort,</HI> being the mo&s;t favourable of all; yet &s;ometimes with con&s;i|derable Apparatus Symptoms; they are few, not large, Ba&s;es &s;carce inflamed, &s;mall Dige&s;tion, being hard with a little white Point; 5th or 6th Day from Eruption they begin to dry away, and gra|dually vani&s;h, leaving only a Freckle behind them, but no Redne&s;s; I have &s;een <HI>Indians</HI> with this Kind. 2. <HI>A di&s;tinct plump Kind,</HI> already de&s;cribed as the Standard. 3. <HI>The Cohaerent,</HI> or &s;mall fre|quent Sort; they are not exactly round, pointed and vivid; but &s;e&s;&s;ile and depre&s;&s;ed, the Symptoms do not intirely cea&s;e upon Eruption, but after &s;ome Time they intermit until the <HI>Stadium</HI> of Maturation, then ari&s;es a Fever, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 4. <HI>The Con|fluent,</HI> they appear &s;ooner than the 4th Day, or are retarded by &s;ome violent Symptom later; their fir&s;t Appearance is frequently <HI>Eri&s;ypilas</HI> like, and and at la&s;t appear of on A&s;h-coloured Cru&s;t or white Skin, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 6.

<P>Some general <HI>Directions</HI> for the <HI>Regimen in the Cour&s;e of the Small Pox.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Let not Numbers be pent up in one Room,</HI> which can &s;carce contain Air enough for the Main|tainance of Health in one &s;ingle Per&s;on, e&s;pecially if kept from Communication with the free exter|nal

Air; for the <HI>Spring</HI> of the in&s;pired <HI>Air</HI> is the continued Cau&s;e of the <HI>Circulation</HI> in our Bodies. 2. <HI>Where the De&s;ign of Nature is obvious, and her Intentions right, we ought not to di&s;turb Nature by Medicines.</HI> 3. In this or any other acute Di&s;tem|per, Nature or the <HI>Spirits ought not to be di&s;turb'd by Noi&s;e or Confabulation.</HI> 4. Where Medicines are required, we are <HI>not to in&s;i&s;t on any Medicine that continues to be di&s;agreeable to the Stomach.</HI> 5. In this Di&s;temper <HI>any violent Symptom appearing mu&s;t be immediately obviated</HI>; Delays here are dan|gerous: But we are to expect in this as in mo&s;t other acute Di&s;tempers, that the Symptoms &s;hould have a Sort of Exacerbation towards Night. 6. <HI>Let not your Mixtures be too much compounded,</HI> that you may be the more certain of the Effects of the &s;everal Ingredients. 7. <HI>The Belly is not to be kept &s;oluble.</HI> It is ob&s;erv'd by every Body, that in the Small Pox (Dr. <HI>Friend</HI>'s Ca&s;es excepted) Opening of the Body by Catharticks, however mild, confounds the Cour&s;e of Nature, and gives the <HI>Small Pox</HI> Fever a Determination to the Bow|els of bad Con&s;equence: The Body &s;ometimes bound up for two Weeks, without any Inconve|niency only the Pain of a labouring Stool at la&s;t, &s;hows that this Di&s;temper does not allow of Na|ture's being di&s;turb'd in her Office: If there hap|pens in any of the <HI>Stadiums</HI> any undue Evacuation or Colliquation, u&s;e moderate A&s;tringents, Opiats, and mild Cordials. 8. <HI>Avoid Grief, Study, inten&s;e Thinking, and the like</HI>; they hinder Per&s;piration, and all other Tendencies to the Surface or <HI>ad extra</HI> of the Body.</P>

Indications of Safety or Danger.</HI> In this, as in all acute Di&s;ea&s;es, we ought to <HI>ob&s;erve the Pa|tient's Pul&s;e, Tongue, Urine, Breathing,</HI> as al&s;o the Eyes, Temper of the Skin, and Po&s;ture of laving.

<P>Dr. <HI>Sydenham</HI> is much extolled from introducing <HI>Opiats</HI> into the Management of this Di&s;temper.

Di&s;cretion however is required in their U&s;e; for where the Blood is languid, they leave the Pa|tient more languid and faint, Tongues drier, Pul&s;e weaker, gravitative Headakes, and the like: The indifferent U&s;e of <HI>Narcoticks</HI> fix the faeculent Hu|mours, and occa&s;ion <HI>Pittings and Scars.</HI> The <HI>Te&s;ta|cea</HI>

<P>Let the Patient drink plentifully of diluting Li|quors; for there is &s;omething <HI>Cau&s;tick</HI> and acri|monious in the Infection. <HI>Herb Teas</HI> much u&s;ed In this Country, I cannot recommend; they &s;eem to wa&s;h away that &s;oft mellow Moi&s;ture of the Mouth and Throat, and do frequently rather oc|ca&s;ion than alleviate Thir&s;t: The more mellow Diluents I always found to an&s;wer better, as <HI>Bar|ley Water, thin Water Gruel, Sack Whey, Vin.

<P N="1">1. The be&s;t <HI>Preparative</HI> for the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> is to keep the Mind as <HI>chearful,</HI> and the Body as <HI>health|ful</HI> as we can. 2. <HI>Proper Evacuations, U.

<P>This <HI>Apparatus, or fir&s;t Fever,</HI> is attended with &s;ome or all of the following Symptoms of Fevers in general, Chilline&s;s, Shiverings, Horripulations, Yawning, Stretching, Giddine&s;s; then Heat, Thir&s;t, with Tongue foul or dry; Pul&s;e &s;tronger, quicker, unequal; a deficent Spittle, Lo&s;s of Appetite, Nau|&s;ea and Vomiting,; Pains in the Head, Back, and Loins; Inquietudes, or Comatoes Affections: Be&s;ides the&s;e, in Eruptive Fevers, particularly in the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> there is <HI>a certain Oppre&s;&s;ion circa cordis regionem, Sneezings, Coughs, A&s;thmatick Breathings, Hoar&s;ene&s;s, Sore Throat, Weeping or Splendor of the Eyes, Do&s;edne&s;s, and &s;ometimes in Children Convul&s;ions.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Eruptive Fevers</HI> (in other Fevers &s;uch Symp|toms only happen towards their fatal End) the <HI>Apparatus Symptoms</HI> are mo&s;tly <HI>nervo&s;i generis,</HI> viz. <HI>Oppre&s;&s;ion at the Brea&s;t, A&s;thmatick Breathings, Vo|mitings, Deliria, Comas, Lumbagos, tendinum Sub|&s;ultus, In&s;ultus Epileptici</HI> in Children.

<P>Where the Symptoms are any ways con&s;idera|ble, let the Patient immediately upon Seizure be <HI>put to Bed,</HI> but not with too many Cloaths. The Temper is not to be <HI>lowered</HI> too much by catch|ing

<P><HI>Blood letting</HI> in the Beginning, without any Exception, would be always u&s;eful, if the <HI>Small Pox</HI> were a &s;imple inflammatory Ca&s;e, and not complicated with &s;ome deleterious <HI>Mia&s;ma,</HI> which requires Strength of Nature to &s;ub&s;i&s;t under.

<P>Purples have generally a &s;trangled Countenance, and an <HI>Eri&s;ypelas</HI> like Small Pox, e&s;pecially if Hae|morrhages are to follow, frequently a profu&s;e Sali|vation.
