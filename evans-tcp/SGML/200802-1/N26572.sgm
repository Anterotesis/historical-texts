HISTORY OF THE YELLOW FEVER.</HEAD>
<DIV1 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Sketch of the &s;ituation of Philadelphia&mdash;State of the city&mdash;Re|marks upon the weather and di&s;ea&s;es of man and other animals previous to the appearance of the Yellow Fever, in 1798.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>PHILADELPHIA, the metropolis of the United States of America, is &s;ituated in 39 degrees 56 minutes of North latitude, and 75 degrees 9 minutes of longitude, We&s;t from London; is upon the We&s;t bank of the river Delaware, and about 120 miles, by the cour&s;e of the river, from the At|lantic Ocean, and is 6 miles above the junction of the Schuylkill with the Delaware.</P>
<P>Agreeable to its original plan, it extends from the Dela|ware, which is on the Ea&s;t, to the Schuylkill, on the We&s;t, making a plot of about two miles in length, and about one mile in breadth, North and South. The ground is level, and generally moi&s;t; its medium height, above the level of the two waters, is thirty-four to forty feet.&mdash;The principal part of the &s;urrounding country is level, ge|nerally cleared of woods, and under cultivation: a con&s;ide|rable portion of that between the city and confluence of the rivers, commonly called the Neck, is meadow ground, low
<PB N="6" REF="035335_0005_100231A09CEC5BA0">
and con&s;equently moi&s;t; in the vicinity of the rivers, it is frequently overflowed, and &s;ubjects the inhabitants to <HI>fever-and-ague.</HI> But, towards the North and North-We&s;t, the &s;i|tuation is much higher. The river Delaware, oppo&s;ite the city, is about one mile broad; the tide ri&s;es &s;ix feet perpendicu|lar, and flows at the rate of four miles an hour; its oppo&s;ite &s;hore, in the &s;tate of Jer&s;ey, is level; the &s;oil dry and &s;andy.</P>
<P>The buildings do not at pre&s;ent extend over half the ground de&s;ignated in the original plan; as the inhabitants, from ob|vious commercial advantages, have preferred the Delaware front rather than the Schuylkill: hence, at pre&s;ent, the hou|&s;es extend nearly three miles North and South along the De|laware, and about three-quarters of a mile due We&s;t toward the Schuylkill. They are chiefly built with bricks, from two to five &s;tories high; the &s;treets are regular, wide and airy, except Water-&s;treet, which occupies the &s;pace between the bank upon which Front-&s;treet is built, and the river, which was originally de&s;igned for &s;tores. It is the narrowe&s;t, yet one of the mo&s;t populous in the city: the &s;treet is only thirty feet wide, and but a little above the &s;ur|face of the tide: the hou&s;es are high, and the greater part of them have no yards, particularly tho&s;e &s;ituated on the We&s;t or bank &s;ide; an inconvenience which tends much to render the &s;treet more nau&s;eous. It is much confined, ill-aired, and, in every re&s;pect, is a di&s;agreeable &s;treet. There are &s;e|veral alleys in the city, which are al&s;o narrow, confined and filthy.</P>
<P>The river, for nearly the whole extent of the city, is in|dented with forced wharves, made, as is u&s;ual, of &s;quare ca&s;e|ments, with logs, and filled with earth, ve&s;&s;els-balla&s;t, &s;tones, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Where Dock-&s;treet is now built, in former years, was a &s;wamp or canal, with a &s;mall &s;tream of water running through it, extending from the river to Third-&s;treet, which became a general nui&s;ance, and a common re&s;ervoir for the filth of a large part of the city. It now forms a hand&s;ome, airy, &s;erpentine &s;treet, having an arch underneath, covered with earth, and paved. This concave &s;ewer begins beyond Sixth-&s;treet, in Potter's-Field, and is carried under ground below the jail to Walnut-&s;treet, and down Walnut &s;treet to Dock-&s;treet, between Second and Third-&s;treets, and from thence down Dock-&s;treet to the river. At nece&s;&s;ary di&s;tan|ces, there are apertures left to receive the water from the gutters of the adjacent &s;treets: the&s;e openings, in the inten&s;e
<PB N="7" REF="035335_0006_100231A2EA4BCA10">
heat of &s;ummer, emit a very di&s;agreeable &s;tench. There are &s;everal &s;inks dug, to receive the water from the gutters, in tho&s;e parts of the city, where there is no other declivity to carry it off. Two of the&s;e, which are the mo&s;t remarkable, are &s;ituated in Market-&s;treet, at the corner of Fourth-&s;treet. They, like the apertures to the Dock-&s;treet &s;ewer, exhale the mo&s;t noxious effluvia; for, dead animals and every kind of nau&s;ea, are thrown into them, and there remain till they become putrified. During the &s;ickne&s;s in &s;ummer 1797, Dr. Pa&s;calis mentions, that being frequently called out dur|ing the night, he could &s;trongly perceive the &s;mell i&s;&s;uing from the&s;e &s;inks in Market-&s;treet as far as Mulberry-&s;treet on the one &s;ide, and Che&s;nut-&s;treet on the other.</P>
<P>A few years ago, there were numbers of mar&s;hes and ponds of &s;tagnant water, in the out-lots of the city, which periodically &s;ubjected the inhabitants &s;urrounding them to fever-and-ague. The&s;e public nui&s;ances are now either drained, filled up, or built upon; &s;ince which, but few are troubled with this complaint. There are, &s;till, &s;ome re|maining in Southwark and the Northern Liberties: there are al&s;o many vacancies on the bank of the river, which are co|vered with a thick bed of miery filth; the wharves, likewi&s;e, at times, become filled up with impure &s;ub&s;tances from the adjoining &s;treets; and, during the &s;ummer, emit, at low wa|ter, a very offen&s;ive &s;mell. A &s;mall &s;tream of water, called Pegg's Run, pa&s;&s;es through Spring-Garden and the Nor|thern Liberties, the bottom of which is wide and miery; its banks are unimproved, and rendered offen&s;ive by the offals which are thrown upon them from the &s;laughter-hou&s;es, tan-yards, &amp;c. adjoining. Beyond this, upon the Delaware, the improvements called Ken&s;ington, are &s;ituated. A great part of which, at high water, is nearly &s;urrounded by the tide, which, when low, leaves a broad, muddy mar&s;h, more than a quarter of a mile round its &s;outh and we&s;t parts.&mdash;Upon this, the heat in &s;ummer, as might be expected, pro|duces &s;imilar effects. One other &s;ource of putrid animal exhalation, which very forcibly attracts the notice of &s;tran|gers, is mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly di&s;covered in thickly inhabited places during the &s;ummer months. Mo&s;t every dwelling of the city has a privy-hou&s;e, &s;ituated generally at the farthe&s;t end of the yard; but the hou&s;es on the bank &s;ide of Front-&s;treet, have them in their cellars: many of the &s;inks, over which they &s;tand, are dug to the depth of between twenty to thirty feet, and built round with bricks: They are not
<PB N="8" REF="035335_0007_100231A4822E1B00">
cleaned till nearly full, which is once in ten or twelve years, and then, in many ca&s;es, it is con&s;idered ea&s;ier to cover them over, and dig others. After many years fermentation, the&s;e &s;inks exhale a very putrid and offen&s;ive effluvia, which is abundantly emitted when the air is moi&s;t, calm or &s;ultry, particularly towards the end of &s;ummer, or after the action of &s;evere heat has excited the putrefactive fermentation.&mdash;The inhabitants are &s;till &s;o well appri&s;ed of its con&s;equence, and knowing that the depth of their wells is not a &s;ufficient preventative again&s;t this offen&s;ive exhalation, that they gene|rally provide their nece&s;&s;aries with an air-pipe, ri&s;ing a few feet from the top; but &s;till, under particular circum&s;tances of the atmo&s;phere, the a&s;cending effluvia is frequently diffu&s;ed round the hou&s;es, alleys, &amp;c. where it is highly nau&s;eous. Some idea of the noxious quality of this gas may be formed from the effects which it produces upon combu&s;tion. If a lighted candle is let down one of the&s;e &s;inks, it will fre|quently be extingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>There are many grave yards in the city, and perhaps &s;ome other &s;ources of putrid exhalation, which are in a manner incident to all large cities. It is not &s;upplied with running wa|ter or fountains; but with pump-wells, in di&s;tributive num|ber, through the city and &s;uburbs; many of which, perhaps, from a communication with the adjacent nece&s;&s;aries, have already become unfit even to wa&s;h the hou&s;es.</P>
<P>The foregoing de&s;cription is chiefly confined to tho&s;e cir|cum&s;tances which are more particularly connecte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> with the object of our undertaking; for, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e incon|veniencies, &s;till there are few cities that can vie with Phila|delphia in point of elegance or even cleanline&s;s: the &s;treets inter&s;ect each other at right angles, and are open to the winds from all points; which, together with their width, regular pavement, conveniency of foot-ways, and the practice of the inhabitants of frequently wa&s;hing the out&s;ides of their hou|&s;es, give to the city a &s;ingular appearance of regularity and neatne&s;s, highly admired by foreigners.</P>
<P>The City and Liberties are e&s;timated to contain about ten thou&s;and hou&s;es, and the number of inhabitants is not over|rated when we e&s;timate the total between fifty-five and &s;ixty thou&s;and &s;ouls. But, notwith&s;tanding this increa&s;e of population, the pro&s;perity of the city has not equalled that of former years. The European wars, at an early pe|riod, produced con&s;iderable changes on the trade, property and nece&s;&s;aries of life in Philadelphia. The fir&s;t influx of
<PB N="9" REF="035335_0008_100231A797861070">
foreigners from Europe and the We&s;t-Indies rai&s;ed the mar|kets, hou&s;e-rents, &amp;c. and gave to the city, in general, a flou|ri&s;hing appearance; property ro&s;e above its accu&s;tomed va|lue. But the &s;ame cau&s;e has, of late years, been productive of very different effects; and our once flouri&s;hing trade has &s;uffered very con&s;iderable diminution: Citizens over-reach|ing their capitals, the general failure of land &s;peculation, the depredations committed upon our commerce, together with the general &s;tagnation of trade in almo&s;t every depart|ment, has of late been followed by an increa&s;ed number of bankrupt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">es, that at lea&s;t equal any period &s;ince the revolu|tion. Such a combination of untoward circum&s;tances could hardly fail of producing numberle&s;s di&s;tre&s;&s;es. But evils of a more &s;erious nature followed: That malignant &s;courge of mankind, the Yellow Fever, again appeared in the city, marking its path with unprecedented horror and deva&s;tation. Scarcely recovered from the baleful effects which it produced, la&s;t year, in the months of Augu&s;t, Sep|tember and October, which di&s;per&s;ed more than two-thirds of the inhabitants; cut off near thirteen hundred of tho&s;e that remained, and added to the already general di&s;tre&s;s a number of helple&s;s widows and orphans, formerly in afflu|ence, but then reduced to want and poverty, in a &s;evere and inclement winter, Philadelphia was this year again doomed to experience a repetition of the&s;e baneful con&s;equences, in a degree far beyond any former period, when mediocrity of circum&s;tances enabled citizens, by a timely flight, to e&s;cape from a premature Death. Before, however, we en|ter upon the detail of the&s;e melancholy events, we &s;hall &s;tate a few primary ob&s;ervations on the &s;tate of the weather and the antecedent di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>Our climate is &s;uppo&s;ed, within the few la&s;t years, to have undergone very con&s;iderable changes: the winters are expe|rienced to be le&s;s cold, and the &s;ummers le&s;s warm than they were 40 or 50 years ago. It is al&s;o &s;aid, that the climate has become more favourable to the generation of epidemic di&s;|ea&s;es, particularly fevers of the bilious type; and that the late recurrence of the Yellow Fever, is, in part, to be a&s;cri|bed to this cau&s;e. The Academy of Medicine, in their ob|&s;ervations, la&s;t year, upon the origin of this pe&s;tilence, ad|dre&s;&s;ed to the Governor of Penn&s;ylvania, mention, that "at pre&s;ent a con&s;titution of the atmo&s;phere prevails in the Uni|ted States, which di&s;po&s;es to fevers of a highly inflammatory
<PB N="10" REF="035335_0009_100231AB74367868">
character, and that it began in the year 1793."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Ruth's works, vol. 4, P. 47.</NOTE> The want of meteorological ob&s;ervations during former years, renders it difficult to decide upon the fir&s;t opinion; but, there is rea|&s;on to believe, that the changes ob&s;erved in the temperature of the atmo&s;phere are not &s;o con&s;iderable as is imagined: The cutting down of woods and the partial cultivation of the &s;oil may have &s;omewhat contributed more to equalize it.&mdash;But we do not di&s;cover that the change produced, even in con&s;equence of cultivation, is in any re&s;pect equal to what has been produced from the &s;ame cau&s;e in other countries. Hi&s;tory informs us "that when Germany and Scythia aboun|ded in fore&s;ts, the Romans often tran&s;ported their armies acro&s;s the frozen Danube; but, &s;ince the cultivation of the&s;e regions, the Danube rarely freezes." Nor have we rea&s;on to believe that the climate is, in any degree, more favora|ble to the generation of bilious or epidemic di&s;ea&s;es; for, if it is gradually becoming more temperate and equal, and a great proportion of the &s;tagnant mar&s;hes in the neigh|bourhood of the cities are drained and cultivated, the cau&s;e, which produced the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es are, of cour&s;e, every day de|crea&s;ing, and the climate becoming more healthy than in former years.</P>
<P>There are but few climates more changeable or irregular than that of Penn&s;ylvania; &s;carcely two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive years, or even days, are alike.</P>
<P>The heat in &s;ummer and the cold in winter are inten&s;e. The mercury, in Fahrenheit's thermometer, has been known to ri&s;e to 96&deg; in &s;ummer, and to fall 5&deg; below 0 in winter. There is not, however, more than one month in &s;ummer or winter in which the mercury ri&s;es above 80&deg; in the one, or falls below 30&deg; in the other. The barometer is but little af|fected by the changes of the atmo&s;phere in this climate; its medium height is 30 inches. The warme&s;t weather is gene|rally about the end of July and beginning of Augu&s;t; altho' inten&s;ely warm days are frequently felt in May, June and September. "The warme&s;t part of the day in &s;ummer is at two, in ordinary, and at three o'clock in the afternoon in extremely warm weather. From the&s;e hours, the heat gra|dually dimini&s;hes till the en&s;uing morning. The coole&s;t part of the four-and-twenty hours is at the break of day. Af|ter the warme&s;t days, the evenings are generally agreeable, and often delightful. The higher the mercury ri&s;es in the
<PB N="11" REF="035335_0010_100231AD1EF2F940">
day time, the lower it falls the &s;ucceeding night. The mer|cury at 80&deg; generally falls to 68&deg; while it de&s;cends, when at 60&deg; only to 56&deg;. This di&s;proportion between the tempera|ture of the day and night in &s;ummer, is always greate&s;t in the month of Augu&s;t. The dews at this time are heavy in proportion to the coolne&s;s of the evening; they are &s;ometimes &s;o con&s;iderable as to wet the clothes." It is &s;eldom that two or three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive warm days occur without being &s;ucceeded with &s;howers of rain, accompanied &s;ometimes by thunder and lightning, and afterwards by a North-We&s;t wind, which produces a coolne&s;s in the air, that is highly invigorating and agreeable. The tran&s;itions from heat to cold are often &s;udden and con&s;iderable. After a day in which the mercury has &s;tood at 86&deg; and even 90&deg;, it &s;ometimes falls in the cour&s;e of a &s;ingle night to the 65th, and even the 60th de|gree. The fro&s;t generally begins to &s;how it&s;elf about the end of October or beginning of November; but the inten&s;e cold &s;eldom &s;ets in till about the middle of December, and the colde&s;t weather is commonly in January. The mean temperature of the air in Philadelphia during the whole year is 52&frac12;&deg;, which is the temperature of the deepe&s;t wells, and of common &s;pring water. The wind in winter generally blows from the N. W. in fair, and from the N. E. in wet weather. The N. W. winds are uncommonly cold and dry. S. W. and W. N. W. winds generally prevail during the dry warm weather in &s;ummer, while the wind from N. E. is frequently accompanied by rain. Thunder and light|ning are le&s;s frequent than in former years.</P>
<P>To the preceding ob&s;ervations, we may add that May and June are u&s;ually the healthie&s;t months in the year. The exce&s;&s;ive heat in &s;ummer has frequently been known to prove fatal to per&s;ons who are much expo&s;ed to it. Its mor|bid effects di&s;cover them&s;elves by a difficulty in breathing, a general languor, and, in &s;ome in&s;tances, by a numbne&s;s and an immobility of the extremities. The exce&s;&s;ive cold like|wi&s;e proves fatal to many, particularly old per&s;ons. The night air is always unwhole&s;ome in the &s;ummer and fall months, particularly during the &s;tate of &s;leep. The frequent and &s;udden changes of the air from heat to cold, renders it un&s;afe at any time to &s;leep with open windows.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding what has been &s;aid of the variable na|ture of the climate of Penn&s;ylvania, it does not nece&s;&s;arily re&s;ult that it is unhealthy; perhaps no climate is unhealthy
<PB N="12" REF="035335_0011_100231AF7250B108">
where the inhabitants acquire, from experience, the arts of accommodating them&s;elves to it.</P>
<P>We are indebted to Dr. Ru&s;h's ingenious and elaborate e&s;&s;ay, upon the climate of Penn&s;ylvania, for many of the above general remarks. In addition to which, we are indu|ced to make a few ob&s;ervations upon the &s;tate of the wea|ther previous to the la&s;t appearance of the yellow fever; for, an opinion prevails with many, that it and other pe&s;ti|lential di&s;ea&s;es in general, are connected with a particular &s;tate of atmo&s;phere, and may be progno&s;ticated prior to their appearance. A &s;imilarity ob&s;erved to exi&s;t between the con&s;titution of man and many of the dome&s;tic ani|mals, has al&s;o led &s;ome to &s;uppo&s;e that certain pe&s;tilential fluids, acting upon the &s;y&s;tem, produce particular and near|ly &s;imilar effects upon both. They likewi&s;e trace a &s;imila|rity between animal life and vegetation, from having ob&s;er|ved, that the &s;ea&s;ons in which mortal &s;ickne&s;s has prevailed among men and animals, has al&s;o proved unfavourable to ve|getables.</P>
<P>Spring &s;et in this year with very promi&s;ing appearances; the ice broke up early, and it being followed by plentiful rains, &s;oon di&s;&s;olved. Vegetation commenced: but this premature a&s;pect was not of long duration. It was &s;ucceeded by cold weather, North-We&s;t winds, frequent &s;howers of hail and &s;light fro&s;ts in the night, which were di&s;&s;olved by the heat of the &s;un on the &s;ucceeding day. During the whole &s;pring, the &s;udden changes of the weather, from heat to cold, were more frequent and extreme than have been known for many years pa&s;t. Even after the &s;ea&s;on was &s;o far advanced that the fruit-trees had put forth their blo&s;&s;oms, there was a &s;mart &s;hower of hail. A few days preceding it, the weather was warm and &s;ultry, ina&s;much, that many per&s;ons put off their winter cloathing, and afterwards caught cold by the &s;udden change of weather. The flower buds, blo&s;&s;oms, and young fruit, in many places, received con&s;iderable injury.&mdash;During the months of May and June, white fro&s;t, more than once, occurred; and, in the neighbourhood of Philadelphia, in the afternoon of the 14th July, there was a &s;hower of hail, and upon the morning of the 19th, there was a &s;light fro&s;t.</P>
<P>The weather, during the months of July and Augu&s;t, me|rits particular attention; for, if a &s;tate of atmo&s;phere favou|rable to the generation of the Yellow Fever ever prevails, it mu&s;t be during tho&s;e months; as the fir&s;t ca&s;es occurred in

July; and, towards the end of Augu&s;t, it was general over the whole city. In the years 1793 and 1797, as well as this year, the fever made its appearance nearly about the &s;ame period, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the end of July and beginning of Augu&s;t, although, by comparing the meteorological regi&s;ters for each of tho&s;e years, we do not find that the weather during this period has been in any two years alike.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Journal of the &s;tate of the weather, annexed hereto.</NOTE> The month of July, this year, commenced with remarkable hot weather. The middle of the month was cold, and the weather in the end, like the beginning, was warm. On the 2d, 3d, 27th, 28th and 29th days, Fahrenheit's thermometer, in the &s;hade, &s;tood from 88 to 92&frac12; degrees, and in many places it &s;tood at 95&deg; and even at 96&deg;. A number of other phaenomena have oc|curred this year, which attracted the attention of the curi|ous ob&s;erver; and, as the&s;e appearances are &s;uppo&s;ed, by many, to be connected with that &s;tate of weather, which they &s;uppo&s;e produces the di&s;ea&s;e, it may be proper to notice them. Thunder and lightning appeared earlier this year, and le&s;s frequent than u&s;ual. The middle of &s;pring and of &s;ummer was remarkably dry: the gra&s;s meadows produced but a &s;canty crop of hay and, towards the end of &s;ummer, whole fields of gra&s;s were, in many places, entirely withered up. Many tribes of in&s;ects were uncommonly nu|merous; as mu&s;quitoes, ants, crickets, cockroaches, &amp;c. The gra&s;shoppers were &s;carcely ever known to appear in &s;uch va&s;t quantities. In the neighbourhood of Philadelphia, they ate up all the gra&s;s, even to the roots, &s;carcely any kind of herbage e&s;caped them; whole fields of cabbage and potatoes were almo&s;t entirely devoured. They were &s;ucceeded by myriads of black crickets; the different &s;pecies of caterpil|lars were al&s;o uncommonly numerous this &s;ea&s;on; the trees, in many places, lo&s;t their foliage by them; but in September they put forth a &s;econd crop of leaves. In&s;tances have like|wi&s;e occurred of fruit-trees blo&s;&s;oming a &s;econd time, and producing fruit late in the fall. The different cla&s;&s;es of mu&s;h|rooms were found in great abundance during their &s;ea|&s;on. Pur&s;lane, during the dry hot weather, continued to grow without putting forth leaves, while the jami&s;on weed flouri&s;hed luxuriantly. The crop of apples was greatly in|jured by worms; this was &s;o general all over the country that the cyder this year is tainted with their acrid ta&s;te. The&s;e, and other &s;imilar phaenomena, have occurred in former years
<PB N="14" REF="035335_0013_1001FE8EC3040C88">
when this di&s;order was unknown, without attracting any particular notice; but, &s;ince the appearance of it in the United States, every uncommon occurrence in nature has been ob&s;erved with an anxious wi&s;h to di&s;cover in it a con|nection with the cau&s;e of this fatal evil.</P>
<P>A &s;hort time previous to the appearance of the fever, a remarkable di&s;ea&s;e occurred among the cats and rats in Phi|ladelphia, which carried off many hundreds of them. After the commencement of the &s;ickne&s;s, the dogs al&s;o were affec|ted. The di&s;ea&s;e which raged among the cats was &s;imilar to that which attacked the&s;e animals previous to the appearance of the yellow fever in Philadelphia la&s;t year, and in New-York in 1796. Little attention has been paid to a&s;certain the preci&s;e &s;ymptoms of this di&s;ea&s;e, &s;o far as we know. In ge|neral, the animal was without appetite, but thir&s;ty; and, at fir&s;t, much inclined to &s;leep; of a dull, melancholy turn, and &s;oon began to look weak and thin. Many died in a numb and torpid &s;tate, while others, in the la&s;t &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e, were &s;eized with a delirium, puking, and an uncommon flow of frothy &s;aliva from the mouth. A moaning or groaning noi&s;e was al&s;o very common&mdash;The&s;e are the general &s;ymptoms, &s;o far as we have ob&s;erved them. In former periods, very little attention was paid to the &s;tudy of the di&s;|ea&s;es incident to the brute creation. But, of late years, and particularly &s;ince the repeated appearance of the yellow fe|ver in different parts of the United States, it has produced more ob&s;ervation; and, it is to be hoped, that a further and more minute examination of the nature of the epidemic di&s;|ea&s;es of the brute animals, will add much new and u&s;eful in|formation to the healing art, particularly &s;o far as it relates to epidemic di&s;ea&s;es among mankind.</P>
<P>As di&s;tempers among dome&s;tic animals have more than once been ob&s;erved to precede the yellow fever among the human &s;pecies, and, by many, are now looked upon as their &s;ure harbinger, it is made, u&s;e of as an argument to corroborate the idea of dome&s;tic origin, and to &s;trengthen the theory of the prevalence of certain pe&s;tilential fluids.</P>
<P>In order, therefore, to prevent the adoption of any wrong or ha&s;ty conclu&s;ions upon this intere&s;ting &s;ubject, in the pre|&s;ent imperfect &s;tate of our knowledge of its cau&s;e, or cir|cum&s;tances attending the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, we &s;hall &s;tate what in|formation we have been able to collect, in hopes, that it may be of u&s;e in &s;ome future period, to direct us to more ju&s;t and certain conclu&s;ions.</P>

During the months of March and April 1797, a remarka|ble di&s;ea&s;e occurred among the cats in London, and extended over &s;everal other parts of England. In three pari&s;hes in London, upwards of 5,000 cats were computed to have been de&s;troyed by it within a fortnight. The common pe|riod of the di&s;order is &s;aid to have been &s;ix or &s;even days.&mdash;The following is extracted from the "Account of the di&s;ea|&s;es in London, for the months of March and April, 1797," publi&s;hed in the Monthly Magazine, on this &s;ubject:</P>
<P>"After the abatement of the epidemic catarrh, a violent di&s;ea&s;e fell among the cats, by which many hundreds of tho&s;e dome&s;tic animals peri&s;hed: the particular &s;ymptoms of their malady, I had not &s;ufficient opportunity of a&s;certaining: but, from di&s;&s;ections, it appears, that the bowels had been drawn together by a violent cramp or &s;pa&s;modic con&s;triction, in|volving likewi&s;e the omentum, and preventing any pa&s;&s;age. In &s;ome, the inte&s;tines were partially red, or blacki&s;h; but, in the greater number of in&s;tances, the contraction and extra|ordinary twi&s;ting of the bowels, had taken place, without any marks of inflammation."</P>
<P>This is probably the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e which has appeared among the cats, in various parts of the United States. It made its appearance in Philadelphia in the latter end of May or beginning of June, 1797, when it was computed to have de&s;troyed four or five thou&s;and cats. In New-York it was fir&s;t ob&s;erved in Augu&s;t, 1797. During its continuance there, a number of the cats, as was &s;aid, left the city, and took refuge in the neighbouring country hou&s;es. The number that died, was &s;uppo&s;ed to be three or four thou&s;and. In two in&s;tances, it was ob&s;erved that lap-dogs, which were wont to play with the cats in the hou&s;es to which they belonged, were affected with a &s;imilar complaint. A di&s;temper appeared among the cats in Hartford (Connecticut) about the end of July or beginning of Augu&s;t, 1797, where it carried off the greater part of the&s;e animals. It appeared in Port&s;|mouth (N. H.) about the &s;ame period; at Bo&s;ton in Septem|ber; at Albany in October, and at Poughkeep&s;ie, &s;tate of New-York, towards the end of November. The &s;ame year it was al&s;o ob&s;erved in many of the other towns in the Uni|ted States. We do not know of any in&s;tance of its being ob&s;erved in any of the country places; but it was chiefly confined to the large cities. From a Bourdeaux new&s;paper of October, 1797, it appears that France has been vi&s;ited by a &s;imilar epidemic among&s;t the cats. One of the health of+ficers
<PB N="16" REF="035335_0015_1001FE91F7A3B6A0">
had opened the body of a cat to di&s;cover the cau&s;e, and found in it a knot of worms. The name of the place is not mentioned, nor is there any other important information ad|ded to the account.</P>
<P>Many other animals, be&s;ides the cats, have of late been &s;ubject to the influence of &s;imilar epidemics: Hydrophobia, or ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ine madne&s;s, has prevailed in many parts of the coun|try, particularly in the &s;tates of New-England. It prevail|ed in the town <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Hartford, Connecticut, in October, 1797, to &s;uch an alarming degree, that the magi&s;trates of the town were induced to exert the authority ve&s;ted in them by a law of the &s;tate, for the confinement of all the dogs. Several other places were vi&s;ited about the &s;ame period with this dreadful di&s;ea&s;e. In Rhode-I&s;land, &s;everal per&s;ons and cat|tle were bitten by mad dogs and died. The &s;ame circum|&s;tance took place in Berk&s;hire, Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, and in many of the towns in the &s;tate of Connecticut. The Rabies, ano|ther dreadful di&s;temper, prevailed among the dogs, in the &s;ame di&s;tricts and about the &s;ame period. It fir&s;t appeared in the town of Berlin, about 12 miles from Hartford, (Con.) in the beginning of March, 1797. Shortly after, the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e appeared at Hartford, New-Haven, Salem, Spring|field; and, in many neighbouring parts in the &s;tate of Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts, where it proved fatal to &s;ome children, who were bitten by infected dogs. Numbers of cattle al&s;o died from the &s;ame cau&s;e. A peculiar di&s;temper prevailed among the dogs in Philadelphia, this &s;ummer, at the beginning of the &s;ickne&s;s; perhaps it was produced from a want of &s;u&s;tenance among tho&s;e who were left by their owners in the city. It is not in our power to &s;tate the preci&s;e &s;ymptoms, nor even the period of the di&s;ea&s;e. In the generality of ca&s;es, the ani|mal appeared pen&s;ive and dejected; did not refu&s;e food; but made no exertions to procure it; gradually became lean, and, in the la&s;t &s;tage, would run to di&s;tant places, as if &s;eized with canine madne&s;s; but, fortunately, when in this &s;tate, they never attempted to bite any per&s;on or to do harm; nor would they even enter the hou&s;e; but, when exhau&s;ted, laid down in the fields and died. At a farm hou&s;e, about &s;ix miles from Philadelphia, we are informed, that three or four dogs came &s;ick from the city, in one day, and expired in the farm yard.</P>
<P>A very violent pe&s;tilential di&s;order prevailed among the cattle in many parts of Germany in the year 1796. Profe&s;|&s;or Reich, of the univer&s;ity of Erlangen, has wrote a &s;mall
<PB N="17" REF="035335_0016_100231BE82FEFF90">
tract upon the &s;ubject; and, we under&s;tand, he accounts for it upon the doctrine of pe&s;tilential fluids, as laid down by Dr. Mitchell, of New-York. A di&s;ea&s;e of a very &s;ingular nature has prevailed among the cattle in many parts of the &s;tate of Connecticut, for ten or twelve years pa&s;t; an account of which is in&s;erted in the Medical Repo&s;itory, publi&s;hed at New-York, vol. 1, page 335.</P>
<P>In &s;ome parts of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and New-Hamp&s;hire, the foxes, during the winter of 1797-8, have been affected with a di&s;order which rendered them an ea&s;y prey to the hunters. Of the particular &s;ymptoms, we have not been able to obtain any correct accounts. We are al&s;o informed, that gee&s;e, in &s;ome of the ea&s;tern &s;tates, have been affected in a &s;ingular manner. Many have been known to &s;eize &s;ome living ob|jects with their bills, and adhere to them till they died.</P>
<P>Nor are the land animals, alone, the objects of the&s;e di&s;|ea&s;es. In the beginning of Augu&s;t 1797, a great mortality prevailed among the fi&s;h in James river, Virginia; the dead fi&s;h were &s;een floating down the river in a&s;toni&s;hing quan|tities. In the &s;ummer of 1795, a &s;imilar mortality occurred among the fi&s;h in Saratoga lake; and, &s;ome years ago, a di&s;ea&s;e is &s;aid to have de&s;troyed great numbers of fi&s;h in a pond near the town of Brookfield, in the &s;tate of Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts.</P>
<P>What references are to be deduced from the&s;e circum&s;tan|ces, we leave for the medical Philo&s;opher to determine. But it does not appear very probable, that they are in any mea&s;ure connected with the cau&s;e which produced the yellow fever among the human &s;pecies; as they do not always appear in tho&s;e &s;ea&s;ons or places when and where that prevails, but generally in the mo&s;t remote parts of the country, which is free from this human &s;courge.</P>
<P>We &s;hall clo&s;e this part of our &s;ubject with an account of the di&s;ea&s;es which prevailed in Philadelphia previous to its general calamity, as appeared in the Philadelphia Monthly Magazine for July, 1798.</P>
<P>"July commenced with uncommonly hot weather; the city being pretty free from &s;ickne&s;s. The cholera infantum prevailed and carried off many children. On the 8th of the month, much rain fell, and the air became &s;uddenly moi&s;t and cool. Many ca&s;es of cholera and &s;everal of dy&s;entery occurred immediately afterwards. The &s;ubduction of heat from the &s;kin, the torpor of its ve&s;&s;els, and the accumulation of blood in the internal parts, in con&s;equence of the appli|cation
<PB N="18" REF="035335_0017_100231C31F6B2AC8">
of cold to the body, might have been circum&s;tances favourable to the production of the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>"A number of days, about the middle of the month, were extremely cool; e&s;pecially in the morning and evening: &s;ome of them very much re&s;embled autumnal weather. To|wards the clo&s;e of the month, &s;ome ca&s;es of bilious fever, of a malignant nature, appeared; the weather was &s;howery and became warmer.</P>
<P>"In treating the cholera infantum, bleeding, calomel, and bli&s;ters, were u&s;ed with advantage. Sometimes any one of the&s;e remedies would cure the di&s;ea&s;e. At other times, the whole of them would prove ineffectual, when it was very violent, or when medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance was delayed. The cold bath cured &s;ome &s;light ca&s;es, and was employed with advan|tage in the convale&s;cent &s;tate of this di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>"In the dy&s;entery which occurred, the u&s;ual remedies were &s;ucce&s;sful; &s;uch as &s;alts, ca&s;tor-oil, laudanum, &amp;c. The laudanum, combined with antimonial wine, and given in the fir&s;t and latter part of the night, proved mo&s;t &s;erviceable. In a violent ca&s;e of the complaint, bleeding, bli&s;ters and &s;ali|vation were u&s;ed with &s;ucce&s;s."</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Fir&s;t appearance of the Di&s;ea&s;e&mdash;General alarm&mdash;Flight of the inhabitants, &amp;c.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WE now proceed to the ta&s;k of recording the ri&s;e, progre&s;s and attendant circum&s;tances of the late Yellow Fever, the mo&s;t tremendous &s;courge, perhaps, ever experi|enced in the United States.</P>
<P>Its origin is &s;till as much a &s;ubject of controver&s;y as in 1793. Tho&s;e who &s;upport the idea of its dome&s;tic growth, in&s;i&s;t much on the long duration of moi&s;t, &s;ultry weather, the filth and &s;tagnant water collected in our &s;treets, inat|tention of &s;cavengers, foul air di&s;charged from the holds of ve&s;&s;els, with their cargoes, balla&s;t, &amp;c. The di&s;ciples of this &s;y&s;tem are, the <HI>Academy of Medicine</HI> and their ad|herents. The arguments brought forward in &s;upport of the above doctrine, are &s;trongly oppo&s;ed by the <HI>College of Phy&s;icians,</HI> and their adherents. They in&s;i&s;t that it has been, mo&s;t unequivocally, imported; that the weather has not been more &s;ultry this &s;ea&s;on than in many other years, in which not even a &s;poradic ca&s;e of the di&s;order was met with; that the police of our &s;treets is va&s;tly better than formerly, e&s;pecially during the period that the Briti&s;h troops were here, and im|mediately &s;ub&s;equent to their abandonment of the city. With re&s;pect to the con&s;truction of a city, very few are equal, hardly any &s;uperior, to Philadelphia; the ventilation of which, is completely &s;ecured, let the wind blow in what|ever direction it may, by its &s;treets inter&s;ecting each other at right angles.</P>
<P>Independent of the&s;e general arguments, it is contended, that the di&s;ea&s;e can be as &s;atisfactorily traced to the ve&s;&s;el or ve&s;&s;els that introduced it, as the nature of the ca&s;e will admit. For, it has been ob&s;erved, that it is one of tho&s;e ca&s;es, which will hardly admit of po&s;itive or judicial proof.</P>
<P>The examination of the nature and origin of the di&s;ea&s;e, we &s;hall treat, at large, in another part of this work; and, at
<PB N="28" REF="035335_0027_100231D8CE5D0C38">
pre&s;ent, confine our inquiry only to the narration of tho&s;e circum&s;tances which occurred, and excited general alarm in the city during the period of its prevalence; but, it is nece&s;&s;ary to remark, that a difference of opinion al&s;o exi&s;ts re&s;pecting the <HI>nature</HI> of the yellow fever: Tho&s;e in fa|vour of its importation, a&s;&s;ert that it is a di&s;tinct and &s;pe|cific di&s;ea&s;e, of it&s;elf, and highly contagious. Tho&s;e in favor of its dome&s;tic origin, affirm, that it is only a higher grade of the common bilious fever of this country, and that it is &s;el|dom or never contagious.</P>
<P>Some ca&s;es of highly bilious fever occurred &s;o early as the month of June; and, perhaps, &s;ome even of yellow fever may have occurred during the months of June and July. The Academy of Medicine, in a letter to the Governor of Penn&s;ylvania, dated December 3, 1798, mention eight ca|&s;es of the fever, which occurred between June 2d and July 12th; but, it does not appear, that the di&s;ea&s;e was commu|nicated by infection from any of the ca&s;es they mention; nor was any alarm excited till after that period.</P>
<P>Many of the inhabitants &s;u&s;pected, that, in certain places, the poi&s;on might remain during the winter, in the hou&s;es, beds and apparel of tho&s;e who died with, or who had, the fever the preceding year, and that the heat of the &s;un might again bring it into action this &s;ummer, perhaps from a &s;u&s;|picion, founded upon a reference to the tran&s;ient recurrence of a few ca&s;es of the yellow fever, in the fall which &s;uccee|ded 1793. Upon which account, it was natural to expect, that the inhabitants would be upon their guard, and u&s;e every means in their power to prevent the return of &s;o dreadful a calamity; and, if it &s;hould be found impo&s;&s;ible to prevent it, that they would, upon its fir&s;t appearance, &s;ound the alarm.</P>
<P>The legi&s;lature of Penn&s;ylvania, having found, by experience, that the exi&s;ting "laws, for preventing the importation of infectious or contagious di&s;ea&s;es into the port of Philadel|phia, and the Health-Office &s;y&s;tem thereby e&s;tabli&s;hed, were defective and inadequate," in April, 1798, pa&s;&s;ed "an Act to alter and amend the &s;ame, and to extend the powers of the Board of Health." Agreeable to the tenor of this law, a Board of Health was in&s;tituted. They entered upon the important and arduous duties of their office in the be|ginning of May la&s;t; and, although they were convin|ced that the new one was &s;till defective, and inade|quate to the purpo&s;es contemplated by its framers, they
<PB N="29" REF="035335_0028_1001FE97160F1840">
were determined to make up for its deficiency, if po&s;&s;ible, by their own vigilance.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of May, the following extract from An act to alter and amend the health laws of Penn&s;ylvania, pa&s;&s;ed the 4th of April, was publi&s;hed by order of the Board of Health, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> "Sec. 8. And be it further enacted by the authority afore&s;aid, that every hou&s;e-keeper within the city of Phila|delphia, the town&s;hips of the Northern Liberties and Moya|men&s;ing, and di&s;trict of Southwark, within one mile of the limits of the city, taking in boarders, arriving by &s;ea or by land, from any foreign port or place, and having any board|er in his or her family, who &s;hall be taken &s;ick of any di&s;ea&s;e what&s;oever, between the fir&s;t day of May and the fir&s;t day of November, in any year, within twenty days next after &s;uch boarder &s;hall come to lodge in his or her hou&s;e, &s;hall, within twenty-four hours next after the knowledge of &s;uch &s;ickne&s;s, make report at the Health-Office of the name of &s;uch &s;ick per&s;on, the time of his or her arrival at the hou&s;e, and of his or her being taken &s;ick, and of the name and place of abode of &s;uch hou&s;ekeeper; whereupon the Phy&s;ician of the Health-Office &s;hall forthwith vi&s;it the patient, and report to the Office his opinion of the nature of &s;uch di&s;ea&s;e, that mea|&s;ures may be taken to prevent the &s;preading of infection; and if any hou&s;e-keeper &s;hall neglect to give information in the manner and within the time afore&s;aid, and &s;hall be there|of convicted, in any court of criminal juri&s;diction within this commonwealth, upon indictment or confe&s;&s;ion, he or &s;he &s;hall forfeit and pay a fine to the u&s;e of the &s;aid ho&s;pital, not le&s;s than twenty dollars, nor more than one hundred dol|lars, to be impo&s;ed at the di&s;cretion of the court, according to the circum&s;tances of greater or le&s;s aggravation attending each particular ca&s;e."</P>
<P>The 5th &s;ection of the &s;ame law enacted, "That all ve&s;&s;els arriving at the port of Philadelphia, during the months of May, June, July, Augu&s;t, September, October and November, from any port in the Mediterranean, or wa|ters connected therewith to the ea&s;tward of the Straits of Gibraltar, or from the coa&s;t of Africa without the Straits, other than the Cape of Good Hope, and from the main land of North or South-America, or the We&s;t-India I&s;lands, be|tween the latitude of the river St. Mary in Georgia, and the beginning of the latitude of thirty degrees &s;outh of the equa|tor, &s;hall be &s;ubjected to ride quarantine before the Marine Ho&s;pital on State-I&s;land (about five miles below the city)
<PB N="30" REF="035335_0029_100231DD861111F0">
for a term not exceeding ten, nor more than twenty days." In con&s;equence of which, it was the uniform practice of the Board of Managers to &s;ubject all un&s;u&s;pected ve&s;&s;els to a qua|rantine of ten days only.</P>
<P>At a meeting of the Board, on the 28th of the &s;ame month, it was repre&s;ented that the health laws had been frequently violated and evaded, by per&s;ons landing from ve&s;&s;els under quarantine, and that the re&s;ident phy&s;ician and other officers of the in&s;titution, had been ob&s;tructed and gro&s;sly in&s;ulted in the legal exerci&s;e of their duties, in open and avowed contempt of the laws, and to the great danger of the health of the city. The board, therefore, "re&s;olved, "That the re&s;ident phy&s;ician, or health-officer of the marine ho&s;pital, inform all per&s;ons under quarantine, that the 2d Section of the act to alter and amend the health laws, pa&s;|&s;ed April 4th, 1798, will be &s;trictly enforced, and that no per&s;on under quarantine be permitted to land, except in ea&s;e of imminent di&s;tre&s;s, or ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity, agreeably to the &s;aid Section." This re&s;olution, together with the &s;ec|tion alluded to, was publi&s;hed for the benefit of all concer|ned. The following is a copy, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<P>"Sec. 2. And be it further enacted by the authority afore|&s;aid, That every &s;hip or ve&s;&s;el, coming from any foreign port or place, bound to the port of Philadelphia, between the la&s;t day of April and the fir&s;t day of December, in every year, &s;hall come to anchor in the river Delaware, as near to the Marine Ho&s;pital as her draft of water and the &s;tate of the tide and weather will rea&s;onably admit, before any part of the cargo or baggage be landed, or any per&s;on who came in &s;uch &s;hip or ve&s;&s;el, &s;hall leave her; and &s;hall &s;ubmit to the examinations, and obtain the certificate hereafter &s;pecified: And if any ma&s;ter, commander, or pilot, &s;hall leave his &s;ta|tion before the &s;aid ho&s;pital, or if any ma&s;ter or commander &s;hall permit or &s;uffer any part of the cargo or baggage, or any per&s;on or per&s;ons arriving in &s;uch &s;hip or ve&s;&s;el, from any port beyond the limits of the United States, to be landed on either &s;hore of Delaware Bay or river, before &s;uch examina|tion be duly had, and certificate obtained, the per&s;on or per|&s;ons &s;o permitting, and the per&s;on or per&s;ons &s;o landing, ex|cept in ca&s;e of imminent di&s;tre&s;s, or ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity, be|ing thereof convicted upon indictment, under this act, by verdict, confe&s;&s;ion, or &s;tanding mute, in any court having criminal juri&s;diction within this commonwealth, &s;hall be &s;en|tenced to, and &s;uffer confinement in the gaol of the county
<PB N="31" REF="035335_0030_100231DF12A329F8">
of Philadelphia, for any &s;pace not le&s;s than one, nor more than three years."</P>
<P>The board, likewi&s;e, directed the Health-Officer re&s;iding at the Marine Ho&s;pital, to vi&s;it every ve&s;&s;el, riding quaran|tine, at lea&s;t once every twenty-four hours, at irregular times, to call the roll of the crew and pa&s;&s;engers, and to &s;atisfy him|&s;elf that they were all on board; and, if any others &s;hould be found on board, to &s;ubject them to remain until the termi|nation of the period of the ve&s;&s;el's quarantine. But, not|with&s;tanding the&s;e precautions, on the 12th of June, the Board received information that two per&s;ons had been on board one of the ve&s;&s;el's then under quarantine; which per|&s;ons were accordingly pro&s;ecuted. The law was al&s;o evaded by a mode &s;till more dangerous to the health of the city and its neighbourhood: both per&s;ons and goods were landed in the &s;tate of Delaware, previous to the ve&s;&s;el's reaching State-I&s;land; which per&s;ons, together with their goods, proceeded to the city. Information of this nature was communicated to the Board on the 16th of July; and, on the &s;ame day, re|pre&s;entations of another nature, drew, from the Health-Of|fice, the following adverti&s;ement: "Whereas, repre&s;entations have been made to the Managers of the Marine and City-Ho&s;pitals, that frequent communication is had between ci|tizens of Philadelphia and el&s;ewhere, and per&s;ons on board of ve&s;&s;els under quarantine, by means of boats going along &s;ide, to the great danger of the health of the city: There|fore, re&s;olved, that every ve&s;&s;el with which &s;uch communica|tion has been permitted, &s;hall perform an additional quaran|tine of five days."</P>
<P>There is great rea&s;on for &s;uppo&s;ing that communica|tions between the city and the ve&s;&s;els under quarantine were carried on to a very great extent. It is &s;aid, that per&s;ons from the&s;e ve&s;&s;els frequently came to the city in the night, and returned again next morning. We are more particular in mentioning the&s;e circum&s;tances; for, it is po&s;&s;ible that &s;ome of the earlier ca&s;es of the fever were thus introduced.</P>
<P>About the end of June, a very great influx of foreigners from the We&s;t-Indies took place, which created the alarm of government, from a repre&s;entation, that their views were ho&s;|tile to the peace of our country; but this proved to be pre|mature. It was cau&s;ed by the evacuation of Port-au-Prince by the Briti&s;h troops. Eight ve&s;&s;els arrived at the port of Philadelphia on the 5th of July, from the ports of Cape-Nichola-Mole, Jeremic and Port-au-Prince, bringing two
<PB N="32" REF="035335_0031_100231E4A2B14578">
hundred and twenty-&s;even pa&s;&s;engers, and one hundred and &s;ixteen &s;eamen. The &s;udden death of the Marquis de Rouvray, &s;hortly after his arrival in one of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els, gave ground for &s;u&s;picion, that the &s;eeds of the di&s;ea&s;e might have been thus early imported.</P>
<P>The period of quarantine, pre&s;cribed by law, was general|ly &s;uppo&s;ed to be in&s;ufficient. The Board of Health, in or|der to obviate bad con&s;equences from this defect, on the 2d July, procured &s;ix of Wynkoop's ventilators; the u&s;e of which had been &s;trenuou&s;ly recommended, in 1797, to the gover|nor and legi&s;lature of Penn&s;ylvania, by the Academy of Me|dicine, as being admirably adapted for expelling the foul air from the holds of ve&s;&s;els, and pre&s;erving the cargo and tim|bers from putrefaction. The&s;e ventilators, the Board direc|ted the re&s;ident phy&s;ician to u&s;e in all ve&s;&s;els that he &s;u&s;pec|ted might require them.</P>
<P>While the Board of Health were thus employing every means, which they could devi&s;e, to prevent a return of the fever by importation, the &s;elect and common councils, and many other citizens, were equally vigilant, both by private example and public authority, to guard again&s;t its dome&s;|tic generation. The &s;treets and alleys were kept clean; the police-officers were enjoined to be vigilant in their duty, and the inhabitants cheerfully gave them aid. The following paragraphs, from the new&s;papers, will convey a more perfect idea how far the&s;e precautions were re&s;pected, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>

<P>The pre&s;ent very warm weather, naturally reminds many citizens of the watering carts, which are depo&s;ited in the large wooden-building at the corner of Walnut and Sixth-&s;treets.</P>
<P>There can be no &s;ea&s;on of the year in which they might be u&s;ed to greater advantage; and it is the earne&s;t wi&s;h, I be|lieve, of all Philadelphia, that they were immediately ap|plied to the purpo&s;es for which they were made. As to dif|ficulties, expen&s;e, &amp;c. &s;urely the&s;e are no objects in a city, which has too often experienced the fatal effects of dry, hea|ted air.</P>
<P>As the great danger is from a collection of dirt, and con|&s;equent putrefaction in our gutters, I would further propo&s;e, that the per&s;ons appointed to clean the &s;treets, in&s;tead of &s;weeping off the loo&s;e, dry dirt, which had much better be left where it is, &s;hould be employed in pumping the water
<PB N="33" REF="035335_0032_100231E62FEF9F28">
into the gutters, and giving them, at lea&s;t, a daily clean&s;ing. Be&s;ides the public pumps, there are a great number of pri|vate ones, who&s;e owners would be glad to have them u&s;ed in this manner, not only for the general good, but for their own &s;akes; as it is well known nothing contributes more to mending the water, than frequent pumping.</P>

<HEAD>Advice to the inhabitants of Philadelphia and other cities in the United States.</HEAD>
<P>The &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on is the &s;ea&s;on of fevers, and of tho&s;e inflammatory di&s;ea&s;es which attack man. It is principally large cities that are &s;ubject to the&s;e misfortunes.</P>
<P>The efferve&s;cence of the bile is one of the mo&s;t com|mon cau&s;es of tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es in the warm weather. I think it will be rendering humanity &s;ervice to point out &s;ome means of pre&s;ervation again&s;t the de&s;troying pe&s;tilence.</P>
<P>One of the general cau&s;es of epidemical di&s;ea&s;es, is the noxious quality of air, which becomes vitiated by a variety of circum&s;tances to which the magi&s;trates &s;hould pay the clo&s;e&s;t attention:</P>
<P N="1">1. The &s;treets often &s;trewed, for days together, with the putrefying carca&s;es of dead animals, &s;hould be clean&s;ed.&mdash;The&s;e &s;treets &s;hould be daily watered, and the gutters &s;wept.</P>
<P N="2">2. A watchful &s;uperintendance &s;hould take place over &s;everal kinds of manufacturies, particularly breweries, &s;ugar|hou&s;es, and others liable to have heaps of fermenting mate|rials.</P>
<P N="3">3. A &s;evere penalty &s;hould be inflicted on keeping pu|trid &s;ub&s;tances in the city.</P>
<P>I will mention an in&s;tance: A few days ago, &s;everal bar|rels of putrid beef were buried a very few inches under ground, and on the out&s;kirts of the city. Putrid &s;ub&s;tances &s;hould be thrown into the river, at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance below the city.</P>
<P>It would al&s;o be very advi&s;eable to bury the dead, at lea&s;t during the hot weather, at a di&s;tance from the city, and a con&s;iderable depth.</P>
<P>A &s;top put to the abu&s;es I have been &s;peaking of, would certainly contribute to the pre&s;ervation of the cities of the United States from that dreadful di&s;ea&s;e, known by the name of the yellow fever.</P>
<P>As a pre&s;ervation for individuals, I would recommend the u&s;e of acids and vomits to tho&s;e who have the &s;tomach
<PB N="34" REF="035335_0033_100231E8ACE5A318">
loaded with bile. The di&s;u&s;e of animal food, and of &s;piri|tuous liquors, a vegetable and plain diet; in a word, what|ever can cool down the heat of the blood and the efferve&s;|cence of the bile, are recommended.</P>

<P>In con&s;equence of the extraordinary vigilance of the city commi&s;&s;ioners, in junction with the inhabitants, the &s;treets, lanes and alleys, within the city, were never known, in any former period, to be kept cleaner, or in better order. The board of health, the re&s;ident and con&s;ulting phy&s;icians of the port, and the other phy&s;icians of the city, were equally watch|ful and vigilant in their departments.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="035335_0034_100231EB00607F20">
On the 2d July, Drs. Wi&s;tar and Duffield communicated to the board of health, the death of Mr. Mark Miller (one of the eight ca&s;es formerly mentioned,) with the yellow fever, at the hou&s;e of Mr. Mark Reeve, merchant, Callowhill-&s;treet, between Front and Second-&s;treets; whereupon, the board ordered the hou&s;e in which he died to be clean|&s;ed and white-wa&s;hed; his bedding and apparel to be taken to the city-ho&s;pital, and buried, for purification; and that Mr. Reeve's family, and tho&s;e who attended Mr. Miller, be recommended to remove from the city. All this was punctually complied with, and no per&s;on was afterwards known to have taken the fever from Mr. Miller. There was not a doubt, among the phy&s;icians, re&s;pecting the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e of which Mr. Miller died. Drs. Hodge and Wi&s;tar, who attended him, de|clared it to have been a true ca&s;e of yellow fever: the black vomit, one of its mo&s;t &s;ure and violent characteri&s;|tics, appeared previous to death. This being one of the earlie&s;t ca&s;es which created alarm, or apprehen&s;ion in the city, this &s;ummer, we &s;hall be particular to a&s;certain the preci&s;e circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e. Dr. Currie, in his <HI>Me|moirs of the Yellow Fever of</HI> 1798, &s;tates the particulars thus: "June 27th, cool, thermometer only 76&deg; at two P. M. Mark Miller died to-day under the care of Drs. Wi&s;|tar and Hodge, with &s;ymptoms of the yellow fever, at Mrs. Reeves's, in Callowhill-&s;treet. He had been much fatigued and debilitated, from loading a ve&s;&s;el at Almond-&s;treet wharf, a mile from his lodgings, in the heat of the day, to which he had walked daily for &s;ometime. He had, al&s;o, according to the account of Mrs. Reeves, &s;lept on the bed in which her &s;on had died of the fever the preceding autumn." By com|paring Dr. Currie's &s;tatement with our narration, it will appear evident, that he has been mi&s;informed re&s;pecting &s;ome of the particulars of this ca&s;e. Mr. Reeve informs us, that la&s;t fall, after the fever had &s;o far &s;ub&s;ided, that the citi|zens were returning to the city, a boy in his employ was ta|ken ill with what was &s;uppo&s;ed to be the yellow fever. He had a mild attack, and recovered. During his illne&s;s, a thick bed-quilt was con&s;tantly kept between the bed-linen and the bed, and that, after his recovery, the bed was, according to advice of the phy&s;ician, laid in an open field among&s;t the gra&s;s, and there &s;uffered to remain for a week or ten days ex|po&s;ed to the cold air and white fro&s;t. The bed was afterwards brought home, and, from that period, was in con&s;tant u&s;e in
<PB N="36" REF="035335_0035_100231ED50B659D0">
the family. Mr. Miller &s;lept upon it for many months pre|vious to his death. On the night of June 5th, Mr. Miller &s;at up to watch the corp&s;e of Benjamin Jones, taylor, in Fromberger's court. Mr. Jones had been but &s;ix or &s;even weeks re&s;ident in Philadelphia. About &s;even or eight months previous, he had been bit by a dog &s;uppo&s;ed to be mad. He was delirious and attempted to bite his attendants. The&s;e cir|cum&s;tances produced &s;u&s;picion that he had the hydrophobia; but his phy&s;ician, Dr. Phy&s;ick, who opened his body after death, a&s;&s;erted it to be the yellow fever. Mr. Miller was taken &s;ick on the night of June 20, &s;ome days previous to which, he had fatigued him&s;elf in &s;hipping &s;ome goods at Almond-&s;treet wharf, upwards of a mile from his lodgings: to which he walked daily. Whether he caught the infection from Benjamin Jones, who&s;e body had been opened, or from any remaining contagion in the bed, or any other local cau&s;e, it will be difficult to determine; the probability is, that he had imbibed the infection from one or the other of the&s;e fir&s;t|mentioned cau&s;es, and that it was excited into action by over|fatiguing him&s;elf in the heat of the day.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid that two other per&s;ons, who were taken &s;ick af|ter they went to the country, &s;uppo&s;e that they caught the infection from the above-mentioned Mr. Jones. They were attended in the country by Dr. I&s;aac Huddle&s;ton, of Norri&s;|town. They, however, recovered.</P>
<P>On the evening of the 8th July, the armed &s;hip Deborah, captain Edward Yard, arrived at the fort from Jeremie. By the following an&s;wers to the official que&s;tions, pre&s;cribed by law, it appears that &s;he buried eight per&s;ons during her &s;tay there and pa&s;&s;age home, and that the harbour of Jeremie was &s;ickly.</P>

<P>On the 16th of July, the Board of Health directed the re&s;ident and con&s;ulting phy&s;icians, to examine the &s;hip De|borah, and report to them their opinion re&s;pecting her con|dition previous to the expiration of her quarantine, and to cau&s;e the bedding and apparel of tho&s;e who had died, to be landed at the marine ho&s;pital for purification; accordingly, on the 17th of the &s;ame month, Dr. Samuel Duffield, the con&s;ulting phy&s;ician, and Dr. James Hall, the re&s;ident phy&s;i|cian, reported, that they had vi&s;ited and carefully examined the &s;tate of the &s;hip Deborah, captain Yard, from Jeremie; and had found the &s;ame remarkably clean, and the people on board, in perfect health: Captain Yard informed them, that he lo&s;t three of his people in Hi&s;paniola, and two on his pa&s;|&s;age home; the la&s;t on the 24th of June, be&s;ides three pa&s;|&s;engers; one was a lady ju&s;t from Europe: &s;he died on the 2d of July, of a fever, which terminated in con&s;tant purging, but without vomiting, or any uncommon yellowne&s;s of the &s;kin. A white child died on the 26th of June, and a Negro child died on the 7th of July. The latter &s;uppo&s;ed to be occa&s;ioned by a wound which it had received on the head, by running again&s;t one of the pikes. That the captain was of opinion, that all his people who died, brought on their di&s;|ea&s;es by intemperance, and by expo&s;ing them&s;elves, when in that &s;tate, to the rain and night air. That he further declar|ed to them, that none of the people who died, either of his crew or the pa&s;&s;engers, had any thing like black vomiting, extraordinary yellowne&s;s of the &s;kin, or, as far as he was a|ble to judge, with any of the &s;triking &s;ymptoms of the yel|low fever; and that their di&s;ea&s;es were not communicated to any other per&s;ons from any of tho&s;e that died. That upon con&s;idering the report of captain Yard, and comparing it with the pre&s;ent very healthy appearance of the people on board, none of whom appeared to them to have been affect|ed by the di&s;ea&s;es of tho&s;e who died, and the number of per|&s;ons now on board (ninety-five) they were of opinion, that
<PB N="39" REF="035335_0038_100231F7A77D7388">
the di&s;ea&s;es of which the before-mentioned per&s;ons died, were not of a contagious nature: That they were more con|firmed in this opinion, from the &s;tate of the four per&s;ons be|longing to that &s;hip, who were then in the marine ho&s;pital, none of whom exhibited any &s;ymptoms whatever of a conta|gious or malignant nature: That they were al&s;o of opinion, that the &s;hip was now in a perfect and whole&s;ome &s;tate; that the people were free from every appearance of contagion: that the bedding and cloathing of all the per&s;ons who died in the ve&s;&s;el, had either been thrown overboard, or landed at the ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this report, the Deborah was permitted to proceed to the city; where &s;he arrived on the 18th of Ju|ly, and di&s;charged her cargo near Race-&s;treet wharf.</P>
<P>Many circum&s;tances have occurred to excite &s;trong &s;u&s;pi|cion that the contagion was imported in the &s;hip Deborah. In con&s;equence of which, we have endeavoured, as far as is in our power, to acquire a ju&s;t knowledge of the mo&s;t im|portant facts relative thereto; and to &s;tate them with all po&s;&s;ible preci&s;ion, that the public may be the better enabled to form a correct judgment upon this important que&s;tion.</P>
<P>The Deborah &s;ailed from Philadelphia in February, 1798, for Cape Nichola-Mole; where &s;he arrived in March; in April &s;he &s;ailed from thence to Port-au-Prince, from Port|au-Prince to Jeremie, and from thence back to Philadelphia.</P>
<P>The&s;e places, which are in the i&s;land of Hi&s;paniola or St. Domingo, had long been garri&s;oned by Briti&s;h troops. In con&s;equence of which, they were more peculiarly adapted to the generation of pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>Dr. Curric was informed by Mr. Lewis, the mate, that previous to the Deborah's taking in her cargo, at Jeremie, &s;he was employed as a tran&s;port in the Briti&s;h &s;ervice. That the yellow fever prevailed in tho&s;e places to which the Debo|rah went is a&s;certained by captain Yard's an&s;wer to the official que&s;tion, No. 11. He al&s;o acknowledged <Q>in conver&s;ation with a gentleman &s;hortly after his arrival in Philadelphia, that while he lay at Jeremie, a very mortal di&s;ea&s;e was pre|valent there, which the natives called the <HI>Maladie de Slam</HI> (a name by which the yellow fever is known in many parts of the We&s;t-Indies, particularly the French I&s;lands) of which the captain and the chief part of the crew of an Engli&s;h &s;hip, from Liverpool, died.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Currie's Memoirs, p. 132.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="035335_0039_100231FBD47899C0">
The prevalence of the yellow fever in St. Domingo, at that period, is further confirmed by the following letter to Dr. Griffitts, from Dr. Edward Stevens, who was there &s;hortly after; and who is well acquainted with the di&s;ea&s;e, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>During my re&s;idence at Santo-Domingo and the Cape, I received frequent information that the yellow fever prevail|ed in almo&s;t all the &s;ea-port towns in the French part of Hi&s;|paniola, particularly at Cape Nichola-Mole. It raged &s;o vio|lently at this latter place, and the mortality was &s;o great, that it obliged the Briti&s;h to abandon the po&s;t &s;ooner than they intended. About the &s;ame time this di&s;ea&s;e made its appearance in the harbour of St. Thomas, and was &s;o de&s;|tructive to foreigners, that it obtained the name of <HI>the plague</HI> from all tho&s;e who &s;poke of it. At Santo Domingo I &s;aw &s;everal ca&s;es of it, during the months of Augu&s;t and Septem|ber. The&s;e were entirely confined to American &s;eamen, while the native inhabitants of the city were altogether ex|empt from it. The privateers which frequented this port lo&s;t al&s;o &s;everal of their crew by this fever, while they re|mained at anchor.</P>
<P>I mentioned to you that a &s;imilar di&s;ea&s;e had broke out on board of the &s;chooner Swift, at Porto-Rico. The follow|ing are the facts re&s;pecting that ve&s;&s;el, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> On the 11th of la&s;t March, &s;he &s;ailed from the Delaware, and, after touch|ing at Tortola and St. Thomas, arrived at the city of Santo Domingo on the 13th of April, where &s;he continued until the 26th of June, when, &s;he went to the Cape, and returned again on the 1&s;t of Augu&s;t, without touching at any other port. She remained at Santo Domingo until the 28th of October, and then &s;ailed for Porto-Rico, where &s;he arrived on the 5th of November. She anchored at the entrance of the harbour, at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from any other ve&s;&s;el. A &s;hort time before &s;he left the city of Santo Do|mingo, &s;he took on board, from a French privateer that had been di&s;mantled, a quantity of rigging, &s;ails, guns and am|munition. From the time that &s;he left Philadelphia until her arrival at Porto-Rico, the crew were healthy, except two of the &s;ailors, who were affected with venereal complaints. The &s;econd day after &s;he anchored at this latter port, the mate and one of the &s;ailors began to complain; and the greate&s;t part of the crew, together with the captain, were &s;ucce&s;&s;ive|ly attacked. The two fir&s;t died after a &s;hort illne&s;s, and one
<PB N="41" REF="035335_0040_1001FEA2019F67C0">
of the others during her pa&s;&s;age to America. The captain e&s;caped, in con&s;equence of being brought on &s;hore and care|fully attended, at the commencement of the di&s;order. When &s;he arrived at Porto-Rico, and during her &s;tay there, both the harbour and city were remarkably healthy, and her crew had little or no communication with either the &s;hore or the &s;hipping. The&s;e are all the facts which have come to my knowledge re&s;pecting the exi&s;tence of this di&s;ea&s;e in the We&s;t-Indies, during the la&s;t &s;ummer and fall.</P>

<HEAD>Extract from Dr. Currie's defence of the opinions of the College of Phy&s;icians.</HEAD>
<P>To weaken, and, as far as in their power, to invalidate the opinion of the College re&s;pecting the origin of the di&s;ea&s;e in Philadelphia la&s;t year, the Academy have brought forward the te&s;timony of &s;everal per&s;ons in &s;ome degree intere&s;ted in di&s;gui&s;ing, or at lea&s;t withholding &s;ome part of the truth. The&s;e go to prove that the declaration of Alexander Philips, who told Me&s;&s;rs. Towne and Purdon, &s;everally, and at dif|ferent times, that he had brought &s;ick per&s;ons to his hou&s;e, was fal&s;e. Mr. Purdon had called on Philips to reque&s;t pay|ment of an account he owed him&mdash;Philips a&s;&s;ured him that he would pay him in a few days, as he had been down the river and brought up an old lodger, whom he had occa&s;ion for as a witne&s;s, but that he was then &s;ick.</P>
<P>That Philips had a man, belonging to the Deborah, &s;ick in his hou&s;e, at the time he was &s;ick him&s;elf, is certain from the te&s;timony of Dr. Griffitts, who pre&s;cribed for him.</P>

<P>There was no in&s;tance of the fever being in Ken&s;ington until the Deborah went there, nor was it in any ca&s;e known to be contagious before her arrival. The people belonging to her, labourers who a&s;&s;i&s;ted to unload her, carpenters who re|paired her, and others who vi&s;ited her, were the fir&s;t who were attacked with the di&s;ea&s;e; indeed, a very con&s;iderable proportion of the fir&s;t ca&s;es have been traced to this ve&s;&s;el. [<HI>See the recapitulation at the end of this chapter.</HI>]</P>
<P>It is probable that the contagion was imported from the We&s;t-Indies in other ve&s;&s;els be&s;ides the Deborah. On the 21&s;t of July, the &s;chooner Aurora, with eleven pa&s;&s;engers,
<PB N="46" REF="035335_0045_1002321737CC87D8">
and fourteen &s;eamen, and the Ariel, with twenty-two pa&s;&s;en|gers, and twelve &s;eamen, arrived at the fort from Cape-Ni|chola-Mole. <HI>Two</HI> pa&s;&s;engers died on board the Aurora, dur|ing her pa&s;&s;age. She was boarded in the bay of Delaware, on the 16th of July, by James Nagglee, pilot. Then it rain|ed. He got wet, and in that &s;tate, he &s;lept upon the deck. He al&s;o &s;lept upon the deck on the 19th, expo&s;ed to the &s;un; and on the 22d, he complained of pains in his legs and feet. He was taken to the Marine Ho&s;pital, on State-I&s;land, on the 23d, and <HI>died</HI> (July 28th)&mdash;the <HI>fifth</HI> day after his admi&s;&s;ion. Previous to his death, he became delirious, vomited blood, and bled at the no&s;e.</P>
<P>The mate of the Aurora al&s;o died at the Marine Ho&s;pital. When he was admitted, he had a &s;welling in his groin, ac|companied with &s;ores in &s;undry other parts of his body&mdash;par|ticularly his head; but, upon examination, he denied that it was <HI>lues venera.</HI> When landed, he walked up to the ho&s;pital, and did not appear to have a high fever; but, the day after, he was &s;uddenly taken with a convul&s;ion fit, and died deliri|ous on the <HI>&s;ixth</HI> day after his admi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Ariel was boarded by James Roland, pilot, on the 16th of July; he &s;lept in the mate's birth, and was not expo&s;ed to the bad weather. He was a very temperate, &s;ober man. On the 25th, he complained of a &s;evere pain in the head, and was &s;ent to the Marine Ho&s;pital on the 26th. When admit|ted, he had a &s;low fever, and complained of great weakne&s;s. He died on the <HI>third</HI> day after his admi&s;&s;ion. Previous to death, he was affected with the hickup, oppre&s;&s;ion of the brea&s;t, and heavy breathing. He bled once at the mouth, and his &s;kin was yellow.</P>
<P>The&s;e circum&s;tances induced the Board of Health, to pro|long the quarantine of the Aurora and Ariel to twenty days; during which, they were well clean&s;ed, wa&s;hed with vinegar, white-wa&s;hed, and had two of Wynkoop's ventilators work|ing on board. They came to the city on the 10th of Augu&s;t.</P>
<P>On the 19th of July, the brig Mary arrived at the fort from King&s;ton, Jamaica, with &s;ix pa&s;&s;engers and twenty-two &s;ea|men. After ten days quarantine, &s;he came up to the city, (July 29) and began to di&s;charge her cargo, con&s;i&s;ting of cof|fee and cocoa, at Ro&s;s and Simp&s;on's wharf, below Wal|nut-&s;treet. Part of the cargo was much damaged, and in a putrid &s;tate. Several &s;udden deaths occurred about this time in the neighbourhood, and the inhabitants were alarmed.
<PB N="47" REF="035335_0046_1002321B14BEE9C0">
In con&s;equence, information was lodged at the health-office, purporting that the coffee and cocoa, landed from &s;aid brig, and &s;tored at Ro&s;s and Simp&s;on's, was in a putrid &s;tate, and extremely offen&s;ive. Likewi&s;e, that a &s;tore in the &s;ame block of buildings, belonging to Mr. Daw&s;on, contained a quantity of hides, in a putrid and offen&s;ive condition. That Mr. Daw&s;on had died that morning of a fever, which had excited great alarm in that neighbourhood, and that his daughter was ill of the &s;ame fever. In con&s;equence of this report, the mayor, by reque&s;t of the board, cau&s;ed all the coffee to be returned on board the brig; and ordered, that &s;he &s;hould be removed from the wharf oppo&s;ite to the Wind-Mill i&s;land; from whence &s;he was, together with all the hands who worked on board, removed to State-i&s;land, where the articles were landed for purification, and the ve&s;&s;el carefully clean&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Academy of Medicine, in their communication to the Board of Health, of the 8th of Augu&s;t, &s;ay, that they <HI>derive</HI> the rapid progre&s;s of the fever, during the fir&s;t week of Au|gu&s;t, to the foul air of &s;everal &s;hips lately arrived in the port, and from the damaged coffee of the above ve&s;&s;el. But, as the di&s;ea&s;e had made &s;ome progre&s;s before the arrival of the bring Mary, it could not, therefore, have proceeded from her alone.</P>
<P>The con&s;ulting phy&s;ician, on the 25th of July, intimated to the Board of Health, that two &s;trangers, who had arrived at a tavern in Front-&s;treet, were lying &s;ick; and, on the 30th of the &s;ame month, Chri&s;topher Holmes, from Penn-&s;treet, was &s;ent to the Marine ho&s;pital; that the hou&s;e was ordered to be clean&s;ed, and the bedding and apparel removed to the City Ho&s;pital for purification. The &s;ame day, a report was made to the board, by Mr. James Yard and Dr. Samuel Duffield, &s;tating, that George Ral&s;ton, who had laboured on board the Deborah, died that day, after a &s;hort illne&s;s. A letter from Dr. Hall, the &s;ame day, mentioned the death of a per&s;on, who was taken to the Marine Ho&s;pital from the &s;hip Ne&s;tor.</P>
<P>The number of deaths and new ca&s;es of the fever, which daily increa&s;ed from the 28th of July to the 6th of Augu&s;t, alarmed the citizens, and became a general topic of conver|&s;ation. The college of Phy&s;icians met on the &s;ixth of Au+gu&s;t: at which time about 26 ca&s;es of the fever were known to exi&s;t in the city. After conferring together, they unani|mou&s;ly agreed to the following re&s;olutions; which were im|mediately communicated to the Board of Health:</P>
<Q><PB N="48" REF="035335_0047_1002321CA2BDC898">
<P>Re&s;olved, That the College inform the Board of Health, that a malignant contagious fever has made its appearance in Water-&s;treet, between Walnut and Spruce-&s;treets, and in the vicinity thereof: and</P>

<P>Whereas, the Board of Managers of the Marine and City Ho&s;pitals of the port and city of Philadelphia, having received information from the College of Phy&s;icians, "that a malig|nant contagious fever has made its appearance in Water-&s;treet, between Walnut and Spruce-&s;treets, and in the vicinity thereof;"&mdash;and the reports of Dr. Samuel Duffield and Dr. Parke, appointed particularly to examine that part of the city, &s;pecifying the particular ca&s;es found therein&mdash;Therefore, re&s;olved, that in order to prevent, as much as po&s;&s;ible, all com|munication with that part of the city, that the health-officer cau&s;e the ve&s;&s;els now lying at the wharves between Tun-alley and Je&s;&s;e and Robert Waln's wharf, including the &s;aid wharf, to be removed, and that no ve&s;&s;el of any de&s;cription what|ever be &s;uffered to come to the &s;aid wharves until the further order of the board.</P>
<P>The board al&s;o earne&s;tly recommend to the inhabitants of that part of the city, included between Walnut and Spruce-&s;treets, and the ea&s;t &s;ide of Front-&s;treet and the river, and al&s;o tho&s;e immediately in the vicinity thereof, to remove without the bounds of the city and Liberties as &s;peedily as po&s;&s;ible.</P>

<P>The ve&s;&s;els were accordingly removed from the wharves above &s;pecified. But, in&s;tead of being "removed to a pro|per di&s;tance from the city," as recommended by the College, they were di&s;tributed to the other wharves. Mo&s;t of them
<PB N="49" REF="035335_0048_10023221FAFABD58">
were &s;ent to the upper parts of the city. The brig Mary, who brought the damaged coffee, &amp;c. was the only ve&s;&s;el which was removed from the city. Perhaps from this cau&s;e it was, that the di&s;ea&s;e, &s;oon afterwards, &s;o rapidly &s;pread, and produced &s;uch a general depopulation. Another circum|&s;tance which may have aided its &s;preading, ought not to pa&s;s unnoticed: a quantity of the damaged coffee, before mention|ed, was &s;cattered on the wharf, which the itinerant poor un|fortunately gathered up; and thus, probably, carried home the in&s;trument of their de&s;truction!</P>
<P>The removal of the inhabitants, from the city, was earne&s;t|ly recommended in the daily papers; nor was any time lo&s;t in communicating the cau&s;e for alarm. The following com|munication, recommending provi&s;ion for the removal of the poor, is extracted from <HI>Porcupine's Gazette,</HI> of Augu&s;t 7th, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<P>The yellow fever is in this city. It is now come out, that it made its appearance about a week ago. Several per|&s;ons are dead with it, and, according to all the accounts I have heard, it &s;preads with greater rapidity than it did la&s;t year.</P>
<P>A number of &s;tories, with regard to its origin, are, as u&s;ual, on foot; but, I believe, the be&s;t way would be to lay a&s;ide all vain di&s;putes on this &s;ubject, and prepare, as quick as po&s;&s;ible, to make provi&s;ion for removing tho&s;e who have not the means of removing them&s;elves, to &s;ituations more healthy.</P>
<P>The Philadelphia Gazette, on the &s;ame day, contained the following</P>
<P><HI>Communication</HI>&mdash;An immediate attention to the advice of the board of health, in evacuating the infected quarter is, perhaps, the only mea&s;ure by which our unfortunate city can be re&s;cued from increa&s;ing affliction. Individual intere&s;t &s;hould yield to a temporary &s;acrifice, in order to avert the public calamity. It is a duty every citizen owes to the com|munity, as well as to him&s;elf, to be vigilant in removing the objects, and thereby impeding the progre&s;s of contagion.</P>
<P>To tho&s;e who nece&s;&s;arily remain in the city, it is almo&s;t &s;uperfluous to intimate the nece&s;&s;ity of avoiding tho&s;e parts where the contagion prevails. A &s;entiment of &s;elf-pre&s;erva|tion, if not of duty to &s;ociety, will be a &s;ufficient re&s;traint.&mdash;Under the favor of heaven, and our own precaution, we may then hope to be &s;oon re&s;tored to health, pro&s;perity, and hap|pine&s;s.</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="recommendation">
<P>THE Academy of Medicine of Philadelphia, having taken into con&s;ideration the exi&s;tence of a malignant bilious fe|ver in this city, have conceived it to be their duty to lay before the managers of the Marine and City Ho&s;pitals, the following facts re&s;pecting its origin, and the means of checking its pro|gre&s;s.</P>
<P>We have, upon inquiry, di&s;covered that a ca&s;e of this fever exi&s;ted in the city on the 6th of June, and that &s;everal ca&s;es of it exi&s;ted in July, in parts of the city remote from the river, and wholly unconnected with each other. They ap|peared to originate from the putrid exhalations of alleys and gutters, and docks, and from the &s;tagnating water in the neighbourhood of the city. We derive the late rapid increa&s;e of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ever from the foul air of &s;everal &s;hips lately arrived in the port, and from &s;ome damaged coffee which arrived in a brig from Jamaica on the 29th of July. In the cour&s;e of our inquiries into the origin of the fever, we did not meet with a &s;ingle fact that could &s;upport the opinion of contagion be|ing imported in the bodies or clothes of &s;ick people in the &s;hips or ve&s;&s;els which lie between Walnut and Spruce &s;treets, where the di&s;ea&s;e has prevailed mo&s;t. Many re&s;pect|able modern authorities a&s;&s;ert that the yellow fever is <HI>not con|tagious</HI> in the We&s;t-Indies, and repeated ob&s;ervations &s;atisfy us, that it is rarely &s;o during the <HI>warm weather</HI> in the United States. None of the ca&s;es we have as yet &s;een, have propa|gated it, and we conceive it to be an error as ab&s;urd, in its nature, as it has been fatal in its operation upon the city of Philadelphia, that the contagion of a di&s;ea&s;e &s;hould adhere to the timber of a &s;hip after a &s;ea voyage, and &s;hould &s;pread from the timber of the &s;hip without contact through an exten&s;ive neighbourhood, and cea&s;e to communicate it&s;elf afterwards by long and clo&s;e connection of the &s;ick with their families and attendants. We lament that this fact, together with many others upon the nature and origin of the yellow fever, which were &s;tated in our letter to the Governor, on the 1&s;t of December, 1797, and by him laid before the legi&s;lature of the &s;tate, have been treated with total neglect in the pre&s;ent health law: the di&s;tre&s;s we felt upon &s;eeing that law is, how|ever, much alleviated by the reflection, that we have not con|tributed,
<PB N="51" REF="035335_0050_1002322A86F2D6D0">
in any degree, by &s;upporting an erroneous opinion, to reproduce the pre&s;ent alarming calamity of our city.</P>
<P>We beg leave to recommend for the purpo&s;e of check|ing the progre&s;s of the fever, an attention to the following directions:</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. The removal of all the families from tho&s;e parts of the city where the di&s;ea&s;e, from the contamination of the at|mo&s;phere, appears chiefly to exi&s;t, and the preventing tho&s;e parts being vi&s;ited by the citizens.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. The removal of all &s;hips and putrid articles of commerce from the wharves and &s;tores of the city.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. The cleaning of the docks, wharves, yards and cellars; al&s;o the wa&s;hing of the gutters every day, and of the &s;treets and alleys three times a week, by means of pumps and fire engines.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. The appointment of a &s;ufficient number of phy|&s;icians to take care of &s;uch of the poor as may be affected with the fever.</P>
<P N="5">5thly. Publicly to advi&s;e the citizens to avoid all the u&s;ual exciting cau&s;es of fever, &s;uch as intemperance, fatigue, exce&s;&s;ive heat, the night air, all violent and debilitating pa&s;|&s;ions of the mind.</P>
<P N="6">6thly. To advi&s;e them, in every ca&s;e of indi&s;po&s;ition, however &s;light in appearance, to apply immediately for me|dical aid.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>ABOUT the beginning of Augu&s;t, the news-papers an|nounced the uncommon healthine&s;s of the city; a circum|&s;tance which has occurred towards the beginning of that pe&s;ti|lence in almo&s;t every city of the United States, where it has appeared. It was the ca&s;e with Philadelphia, New-York, and Baltimore, in 1797; and with Philadelphia, Be&s;ton, New-York, and &s;ome other towns, this year. Even, on the fir&s;t ap|pearance of the di&s;ea&s;e, we have been congratulated for the uncommon health of the city. Declarations of uncommon health, at this &s;ea&s;on, will, perhaps, hereafter, be looked upon as an omen of di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The publications of the College of Phy&s;icians, the Board of Health, and the Academy of Medicine, on the &s;ixth, &s;e|venth, and eighth days of Augu&s;t, produced the mo&s;t &s;erious alarm among&s;t all cla&s;&s;es of citizens. Numbers fled, and crouded into the &s;urrounding towns and country, to the di&s;|tance of twenty, thirty, and even fifty miles from the city, to provide refuge for their families and friends. The removals from the city were much more general and more rapid than in 1793. It is probable, that at lea&s;t twice, if not three times the number of per&s;ons fled this year, as at any former period. Many who had been witne&s;&s;es to the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of 1793 and 1797, and appeared then the mo&s;t undaunted, were now the fir&s;t to remove from danger. For the fir&s;t three weeks after the alarm, the &s;treets were crouded with waggons and carts, loaded with goods and furniture. Forty or fifty wag|gons, be&s;ides carts, have been &s;een in their route to the coun|try,
<PB N="55" REF="035335_0054_10023239D52AFDB8">
in one direction. One &s;quare, in the centre of the city, where, in 1793, there removed only about twenty-five per&s;ons, in 1798, there were above one hundred and forty. The di&s;per&s;ion began about the &s;ixth and eighth of Augu&s;t, and, altho' mo&s;t numerous in the two &s;ucceeding weeks, they continued partially until the middle of September. Many, who at the beginning, when the di&s;ea&s;e was confined to parti|cular parts of the city, had adopted the re&s;olution of &s;taying, and confining them&s;elves to their hou&s;es, were afterwards in|duced to remove; becau&s;e, the di&s;ea&s;e approached either their doors or neighbourhood. The number who fled from the city have been e&s;timated at <HI>three-fourths</HI> to <HI>five-&s;ixths</HI> of the whole inhabitants: the total number of inhabitants have been e&s;ti|mated at fifty to &s;eventy thou&s;and. We have e&s;timated them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 8.</NOTE> at fifty-five to &s;ixty thou&s;and; and we think it probable, that about forty thou&s;and may have removed from the city.</P>
<P>In 1793, our citizens complained of inho&s;pitality in the country, ari&s;ing principally from the terror created by the novelty of the di&s;order. Then it was believed to be as contagi|ous in the country as in the unfortunate city, which poured forth its fugitives in every direction. It was not, therefore, to be wondered, that our citizens were &s;hunned, as if even their approach carried inevitable de&s;truction. To repel &s;uppo&s;ed dangers, guards were &s;tationed, with arms, to &s;top the flight of the wanderers. They were then refu&s;ed the nece&s;|&s;aries of life; and, in many in&s;tances, they died for want. Many could not always procure a comfortable lodging. The ca&s;e was rather different this year. An idea, now prevailed, grounded upon the experience of 1793 and 1797, that the di&s;order was not communicable in the country; in con&s;e|quence of which, there was le&s;s difficulty made to the recep|tion of our citizens. Throughout the country, the hou&s;es were generally open for them: accommodations were fur|ni&s;hed at rea&s;onable rates: the extortions practi&s;ed were few. There were &s;ome however, &s;ignalized by avarice.</P>
<P>Altho' accommodations were generally afforded rea&s;on|able &s;till the &s;ufferings of our citizens were very con&s;ider|able. Many per&s;ons, accu&s;tomed to &s;pacious hou&s;es, and all the comforts and luxuries which Philadelphia could furni&s;h, were obliged to content them&s;elves with, perhaps, one &s;mall room, wherein two, three or four beds were crouded together; be|&s;ides this, in &s;ome &s;ituations remote from markets, the fare
<PB N="56" REF="035335_0055_1002323CE87427C8">
was very coar&s;e; and, in &s;ome places, not abundant. In&s;tan|ces have occurred, of women, in a &s;tate of parturition, in bleak, de&s;olate rooms, almo&s;t without a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>The Health Office was removed from Walnut &s;treet to the City Hall, where it was kept open, night and day. The City-Tavern was &s;hut up, and the different public offices, banks, &amp;c. were removed, either to the remoter parts of the city, to Germantown, Trenton, Che&s;ter, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>Meantime, the di&s;ea&s;e continued to increa&s;e, and appeared in parts of the city, remote from where it fir&s;t was di&s;cover|ed. The number of deaths in the city and &s;uburbs was col|lected for the new&s;papers, and publi&s;hed daily. The returns of the City-Ho&s;pital were al&s;o regularly reported; and, after the 15th of Augu&s;t, a daily report of the new ca&s;es was pub|li&s;hed, collected from the different phy&s;icians, by Mr. JOHN JARVIS, who was employed by the Board of Health for that purpo&s;e. The&s;e reports were a index by which the citizens were enabled, with &s;ome degree of certainty, to judge of its progre&s;s, exten&s;ion and decline. The arrangements of the Board of Health, for the removal of the &s;ick, interment of the dead, &amp;c. were judicious and early. They empowered all the regular practi&s;ing phy&s;icians to grant orders for ad|mi&s;&s;ion into the City Ho&s;pital, and coachees were provided by the Board for that purpo&s;e.&mdash;At the Ho&s;pital burying-ground, graves were always ready: the grave diggers re|mained day and night in the yard.&mdash;When a per&s;on died, it was only nece&s;&s;ary to make application at the Health-Office, where hear&s;es and coffins were in readine&s;s to convey the corp&s;e to the grave. The patients in the City-Ho&s;pital were placed under the management of Dr. Philip Syng Phy&s;ick, and Dr. Samuel Cooper. They re&s;ided there con&s;tantly, and were furni&s;hed with two a&s;&s;i&s;tants;&mdash;a competant number of nur&s;es and attendants, with medicine, and every thing ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the comfort and relief of the &s;ick;&mdash;nor were the poor, who were &s;ick in the city, neglected: &s;kilful phy&s;i|cians were appointed to attend them, and medicines provid|ed for their u&s;e, at the expen&s;e of the public. The north part of the city, and the Northern-Liberties, were placed under the care of Dr. Francis Bowes Sayre, Dr. James Mea&s;e, and Dr. Kinlaid: Southwark, and the &s;outh part of the city, were attended by Dr. John Church and Dr. Benjamin Duffield; and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">or of the city were attended by Dr. Samuel Duf|field:</P>
<P>In the early period of the calamity, the di&s;ea&s;e a&s;&s;umed a
<PB N="57" REF="035335_0056_1002324013F16478">
more malignant form, than it did in '93 or '97, and very great mortality took place: not <HI>one</HI> in <HI>&s;ix</HI> ca&s;es now reco|vered. Several of the phy&s;icians announced their intention of leaving the city&mdash;perhaps, urged by the recollection of the great mortality among phy&s;icians the year previous.&mdash;An idea that it was the plague, and incurable, was generally propagated and believed: Nur&s;es were with difficulty procu|red, perhaps from the experience of '97, which proved, that the native blacks were not more exempt from the di&s;ea&s;e than the whites.&mdash;An almo&s;t univer&s;al antipathy to the City Ho&s;|pital prevailed. The terror of being forceably &s;ent there, pre|vented many from acknowledging their &s;ickne&s;s, until they were unable to conceal it; and &s;carcely <HI>one</HI> patient in <HI>ten</HI> would acknowledge that his di&s;ea&s;e was the prevailing fever. This operated in producing a delay in calling for medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance, until that period, when it was difficult to overcome it by the power of medicine. A want of confidence likewi&s;e prevented many from applying to a phy&s;ician for advice. They were convinced, from experience, that in jarring opinions, humanity is often lo&s;t &s;ight of, by an ob&s;tinate ad|herence to error: in the former years, the medical pen was, in many in&s;tances, dipped in gall. "The &s;everal combatants took their peculiar grounds, and di&s;dained, in too many ca&s;es, to &s;ave the life of a human being, by following any other &s;ugge&s;tions than their own. They di&s;tracted the public mind, and &s;hook all confidence in medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance."</P>
<P>But, the rever&s;e of this was exhibited this &s;ea&s;on; and it was truly agreeable, to ob&s;erve the harmony that prevailed among the phy&s;icians in this period of &s;ickne&s;s and di&s;tre&s;s. They all agreed in advi&s;ing their friends to leave the city; altho' they "<HI>derived</HI>" the di&s;ea&s;e from different cau&s;es. The practi&s;e of the one, therefore, became more a&s;&s;imilated to that of the other.</P>
<P>The Board of Health, impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of the con|&s;equences of delaying to apply for medical aid, on the 13th of Augu&s;t, publi&s;hed the following recommendation:</P>

<HEAD>THE ANSWER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear and worthy Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I am &s;orry to di&s;cover, by your letter, your want of &s;uc|ce&s;s in the treatment of our malignant fever, at the City Ho&s;pital. I do not wonder at it: you &s;eldom &s;ee the di&s;ea&s;e in is fir&s;t &s;tage; and, when you do, you meet it in an aggra|vated &s;tate, by the motion your patients undergo in being con|veyed to the Ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to your reque&s;t, I have &s;at down to inform you of the practice which I have adopted in our pre&s;ent epidemic. In the treatment of the yellow fever of la&s;t year, I have oc|ca&s;ionally lamented the lo&s;s of patients after reducing the pul&s;e by bleeding, and by the liberal u&s;e of purging medi|cines. I have &s;u&s;pected that death occurred in tho&s;e ca&s;es, from the &s;tagnation of acrid bile in the gall-bladder, or its clo&s;e adherence to the upper bowels, in the manner de&s;cribed by Dr. Mitchell, in his account of the yellow fever-in Vir|gina, in the year 1741. The &s;low pul&s;e which occurs about the 4th day, I &s;u&s;pect further to be the effect of this bile. Its effects in a much le&s;s morbid &s;tate in the jaundice, in reduc|ing the pul&s;e, is well known. Mr. John Hunter &s;ays, he once met with an in&s;tance in which it fell to thirty-two &s;trokes in a minute in that di&s;ea&s;e. Revolving the&s;e facts in my mind, I re&s;olved to try to remove this bile, by exciting an <HI>artificial cholera morbus,</HI> about the 4th day of the fever. I was the more di&s;po&s;ed to attempt this method of cure, from believing, as I have done for &s;everal years, that a Cholera Morbus is no|thing but the fir&s;t grade of billious fever thrown in upon the bowels, ju&s;t as the Dy&s;entery and Diarrhoea are the internal forms of a common billious or intermitting fever.</P>
<P>I began this mode of treating the fever eights day ago. My &s;olicitude for the i&s;&s;ue of it was very great. Thank God, it has &s;ucceded to my wi&s;hes; and thereby le&s;&s;oned, in a great degree, the anxiety and di&s;tre&s;s which accompany our at|tendance upon this ferocious di&s;ea&s;e. The medicines I u&s;e for <HI>&s;haking</HI> the gall-bladder and bowels, and <HI>di&s;charging</HI> the
<PB N="60" REF="035335_0059_10023249D2D14E78">
contents are, tartar-emetic, gamboge, jalap and calomel, combined, or given &s;eparately, and in &s;mall or large do&s;es, according to circum&s;tances. Perhaps Turpeth mineral might be added to this li&s;t of vomiting and purging medicines with advantage. In one ca&s;e, I gave four grains of tartar-emetic, and twenty of calomel. It operated freely upwards and down|wards, and brought away a large quantity of green and black bile, but without exciting the lea&s;t cramp or pain in the &s;tomach or bowels. At the time I gave it, death appeared to be creeping upon the patient. The next day he was out of danger. The per&s;on thus re&s;cued from the grave, was the &s;on of Mr. Richard Ren&s;haw. Indeed, I have not, as yet, lo&s;t a &s;ing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e patient to whom I have given this powerful remedy. In one in&s;tance I fear it will fail. It is in a boy of &s;ixteen years of age, to whom I have given near thirty grains of tar|tar-emetic in the cour&s;e of a few hours, without producing the lea&s;t evacuation from his &s;tomach or bowels. I have ob|&s;erved the &s;ame increa&s;e of &s;trength after its operation, that we ob&s;erve after bleeding and purging in the beginning of the fever.</P>
<P>Vomits are old remedies in the yellow fever of the We&s;t-Indies. I gave them on the fir&s;t day of the di&s;ea&s;e in the year 1793, and always without &s;ucce&s;s. They uniformly did harm, when given in the beginning of the fever, in its wor&s;t grade, in 1797. The rea&s;on of this failure in their efficacy, I now perceive was, becau&s;e they were given before the violent morbid action in the &s;y&s;tem was reduced or moderated by bleeding and purging. After this change is induced in the di&s;ea&s;e, they are perfectly &s;afe. The time for exhibiting them &s;hould be regulated by the pul&s;e, and other &s;ymptoms. In moderate ca&s;es of the fever, they are as proper in its fir&s;t &s;tage, as on the fourth day. As there is a bli&s;tering point in all fevers, &s;o there appears to be an <HI>emetic point</HI> in the yellow fever. It may occur on the &s;econd, and it may be protracted to the &s;ixth or &s;eventh day of the di&s;ea&s;e. I have not given the medicine I have mentioned in any ca&s;e where the patient com|plained of pain or burning in the &s;tomach; but, I have con|&s;idered a nau&s;ea, and a moderate degree of puking, as no ob|&s;tacle to its u&s;e; for, Dr. Phy&s;ick has taught me by his di&s;&s;ec|tions, that the&s;e &s;ymptoms may exi&s;t without the lea&s;t infla|mation in the &s;tomach, and that they have been ab&s;ent where the &s;tomach has appeared after death to have been highly in|flamed.</P>
<P>The cure of the fever &s;hould not re&s;t upon a &s;ingle do&s;e of
<PB N="61" REF="035335_0060_1002324DF73DF3D8">
the medicine. I have given two do&s;es of it in a day in &s;everal ca&s;es, and have given it in one ca&s;e, every day for three &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive days.</P>
<P>It has often been remarked, that no two epidemics are ex|actly alike. They vary not only in different climates, but in the &s;ame climate in different years. They even vary with the changes of the weather in the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on. The fever of 1797 differed in &s;everal particulars from the fever of 1793, and the pre&s;ent epidemic differs materially from both. In many of the ca&s;es I have &s;een, it exceeds the fever of la&s;t year in its ma|lignity. The&s;e variations in di&s;ea&s;es call for corre&s;ponding changes in our practice.</P>
<P>I have communicated an account of the <HI>time</HI> and <HI>man</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> di&s;charging the contents of the gall-bladder and bowels to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|veral of our brethren. I ardently hope it may be univer&s;ally &s;ucce&s;sful in their hands!</P>
<P>If any thing new occurs in your practice in the Ho&s;pital, do me the favor of informing me of it.</P>

<P>The following remarks, attempting to prove that the di&s;ea&s;e is contagious, is taken from the Philadelphia Gazette:</P>
<P>"The pre&s;ent alarming &s;ituation of our city, is, alas! tru|ly deplorable&mdash;almo&s;t in a general &s;tate of infection with a di&s;ea&s;e, to who&s;e virulence, medicinal &s;kill is lamentably com|pelled to acknowledge its inferiority! Former experience is rendered, in a great mea&s;ure, u&s;ele&s;s, by the very material dif|ference in the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e.&mdash;The mo&s;t copious bleed|ing, and the mo&s;t violent purgatives have been found ineffec|tual; and the &s;ucce&s;s that will attend the new &s;y&s;tem of emp|tying the gall-bladder, is, at lea&s;t, problematical. With regard to the opinion of the non-contagion of the di&s;order, I have very great rea&s;on to doubt it. I have known, lately, &s;everal in|&s;tances, that could not be accounted for upon any other prin|ciple than that of contagion. The mo&s;t &s;triking of the ca&s;es I allude to, is, where &s;everal of a family, living in a healthy and uninfected part of the city, took the di&s;order from a per|&s;on in the family, whom they had for &s;everal days clo&s;ely at|tended; without having them&s;elves been in any part of the city that could even have been &s;uppo&s;ed to be infected. I
<PB N="62" REF="035335_0061_1001FEAA448BE8F0">
would caution my fellow-citizens not to tru&s;t too implicitly to this fatal opinion, which has been &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly propagated. A confidence in it, in ca&s;e it &s;hould happen to be erroneous, may prove the de&s;truction of thou&s;ands, while, by acting un|der a di&s;belief of it, and u&s;ing every po&s;&s;ible precaution, many lives may be pre&s;erved. It is at lea&s;t doubtful whether it is, or is not, contagious; and there being a doubt, I think the wi|&s;e&s;t cour&s;e to be pur&s;ued is obvious: I would advi&s;e my friends, to avoid, as much as po&s;&s;ible, expo&s;ing them&s;elves to the night air, or morning fogs; nothing tending more effectually to predi&s;po&s;e the body to infection."</P>
<P>Many per&s;ons who had gone into the country for &s;afety, were afterwards &s;eized with the fever. It is more than proba|ble that they had imbibed the contagion before they left the city. In con&s;equence, the Board of Health, on the 22d of Au|gu&s;t, authori&s;ed the phy&s;icians to receive into the Ho&s;pital, all &s;uch per&s;ons as came from the country. There were now about fifty patients in the Ho&s;pital: the new ca&s;es amounted to about forty, and the deaths, to above thirty, per day.&mdash;The difficulty of procuring nur&s;es to attend the &s;ick, induced the Board of Health, to &s;olicit &s;uch per&s;ons, of good character, as were willing and qualified for that office, to leave their ad|dre&s;s at the Health Office; where citizens, who required them, were invited to apply.</P>
<P>The &s;ufferings of the poor, and, indeed of many others in middling circum&s;tances of life, were extreme: deprived, as they were, of all employment, and unable to procure money from tho&s;e who owed them;&mdash;a &s;tagnation to trade and other cau&s;es, rendered them incapable of removing their families to the country; and many of them were almo&s;t, literally, &s;tarving: even the re&s;ources of credit were not left; as there were very few &s;tores open, or bakers who remained in town. In this cri&s;is, the Guardians of the Poor liberally &s;tepped for|ward; and, in junction with the Board of Health, erected tents on the ea&s;t bank of the river Schuylkill; to which they invited the citizens to remove with their families. There were al&s;o tents afterwards erected at Ma&s;ters' Place, for the &s;ame laudable purpo&s;e; and provi&s;ion was made for the relief of the poor in the city, who&s;e &s;ituations prevented them from removing.</P>

<SALUTE>Fellow Citizens,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Impelled by the awful progre&s;s and unparalleled malignity of the prevailing fever, we are con&s;trained to addre&s;s your feelings, as well as your rea&s;on, in order to avert the fatal de&s;|truction, which, with rapid &s;trides, is pervading our ill-fated city and &s;uburbs.</P>
<P>The be&s;t &s;kill of our phy&s;icians, and all the powers of me|dicine, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, have proved unequal in the conte&s;t with this devouring poi&s;on.</P>
<P>With the mo&s;t affecting &s;ympathy, and anxious &s;olicitude, we have, to the be&s;t of our judgments, endeavoured to em|ploy, as circum&s;tances appeared to require, the power and the means entru&s;ted to us, in arre&s;ting its progre&s;s, and alleviat|ing its concomitant mi&s;eries. We &s;hall continue to employ them with unremitting zeal; but, we have neither the power nor the means to accompli&s;h ALL THE MEASURES nece&s;&s;ary to check its exten&s;ion, or provide for the pre&s;&s;ing exigencies of
<PB N="64" REF="035335_0063_100232576471F4C0">
the moment. The powers delegated, and appropriations made by law, to the in&s;titutions under our direction, are impotent, indeed, when compared to the magnitude of the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>It remains for our fellow-citizens to attain, by their energy, the ends, which, alone, can &s;top its progre&s;s and dimini&s;h its horrors.</P>
<P>We have, in conjunction with the Guardians of the Poor, cau&s;ed tents to be erected on the ea&s;t bank of the Schuylkill, for the accommodation of the indigent; where near twelve hundred are already provided for, out of the fund appropria|ted for the ordinary relief of the poor. This is but a partial mitigation of the evils which <HI>environ</HI> thou&s;ands who have a claim upon the philanthropy of tho&s;e who are in more for|tunate circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>The difficulty of procuring a place of refuge, at pre&s;ent, in the country, is too well known; and the expen&s;e attending the removal of a family, has di&s;couraged many from the attempt, who are in circum&s;tances to live comfortably at home.</P>
<P>What remains to be done? Citizens of re&s;pectability and influence!&mdash;come forward, and form your&s;elves into a com|mittee for the purpo&s;e of erecting, on the we&s;t bank of the Schuylkill, all the tents that can be collected: let the tents be floored with boards, and made as comfortable as po&s;&s;ible.&mdash;If tents cannot be had, boards, in abundance, may be procured for the erection of &s;heds. Admoni&s;h tho&s;e citizens who have no place of refuge, to take &s;helter there,&mdash;particularly tho&s;e from the ea&s;t part of the city, the di&s;trict of Southwark, and the Northern Liberties.&mdash;In &s;hort, ALL who can leave their homes, without manife&s;t injury;&mdash;except tho&s;e who are ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the protection of the city and liberties.</P>
<P>The committee &s;hould have the general &s;uperintendance and regulation of the tents, and authority to pre&s;erve order; contract for certain &s;upplies of bread, meat, vegetables, wood, &amp;c. at the lowe&s;t po&s;&s;ible rates. Tho&s;e who are not in cir|cum&s;tances to pay, mu&s;t be &s;upplied by public bounty.</P>
<P>It is at lea&s;t an unequal, perhaps an unju&s;t mode of rai&s;ing money by an appeal to the humanity of generous individuals; but, if on any occa&s;ion, it may be ju&s;tified, the pre&s;ent may be a&s;&s;umed without he&s;itation.</P>
<P>We call your attention to the actual and undi&s;gui&s;ed &s;tate of our city. Con&s;ider the mortality and rapid increa&s;e of the &s;ick at &s;o early a period.&mdash;View the li&s;t of your phy&s;icians, and <HI>mark how few are at their po&s;ts;</HI> and we believe you will think, with us, that the pre&s;ervation of health is only to be at|tained by flight.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="035335_0064_1002325A8218B288">
Do not flatter your&s;elves, fellow-citizens, that this picture is too highly coloured: we &s;peak from conviction, and a knowledge of facts; and doubt not, but that the lives of hun|dreds, perhaps of thou&s;ands, may be pre&s;erved, by the adop|tion of the&s;e or &s;imilar mea&s;ures.</P>

<P>Much merit is due to the framer of this elegant, feeling, and pathetic addre&s;s, which, in a very ample manner, pro|duced the contemplated relief. The Board of Health were, however, aware, that it could not produce the immediate &s;upply which their exigencies pre&s;ently required. To obvi|ate which, they reque&s;ted their committee, which was ap|pointed to act in junction with a committee of the Guar|dians of the Poor, for the purpo&s;e of rai&s;ing means for the relief and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of per&s;ons de&s;irous of removing from the City and Liberties, to procure, if po&s;&s;ible, the nece&s;&s;ary aid.

<P>The pro&s;pect which the city now afforded was truly deplo|rable. Accounts, from almo&s;t every quarter ea&s;t of Seventh-&s;treet, furni&s;hed the mo&s;t gloomy pictures of di&s;ea&s;e and death. The City Ho&s;pital contained about 100 &s;ick per&s;ons, and the daily admi&s;&s;ions amounted to about 22. One hun|dred and &s;even new ca&s;es, and &s;ixty-&s;even deaths, per day, had been reported<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See table, at the end of this chapter.</NOTE>&mdash;and to add, if po&s;&s;ible, to the general di&s;|tre&s;s, the &s;ons of rapine and robbery were availing them&s;elves of the unguarded &s;tate of the city, to enhance them&s;elves by their ignominious plunder.

<HEAD>MEDICAL ADVICE TO THE CITIZENS OF PHILADELPHIA.</HEAD>
<P>The following directions for the prevention and treatment of the prevailing fever, are affectionately recommended to tho&s;e citi|zens of Philadelphia, who are unable to procure the regular at|tendance and advice of phy&s;icians, by BENJAMIN RUSH, SAMUEL P. GRIFFITTS. <DATE>September 3d, 1798.</DATE></P>
<P>THE &s;eeds of the di&s;ea&s;e may exi&s;t in the body, for a con|&s;iderable time, without doing any harm. It is generally ex|cited by one or more of the following cau&s;es, which of cour&s;e,
<PB N="68" REF="035335_0067_1002326672F83F90">
ought to be carefully avoided, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> fatigue, a long walk, &s;tanding in the &s;un, or in a current of air, intemperance in eating and drinking, co&s;tivene&s;s, violent pa&s;&s;ions, or &s;udden emotions of the mind, thin dre&s;&s;ed, light bed clothes, and, above all, the night air.</P>
<P>It is of con&s;equence for our citizens to know, that we have but one fever in our city at pre&s;ent, and that every febrile indi&s;po&s;ition partakes of the prevailing malignant epidemic. Hundreds have died from mi&s;taking the fir&s;t &s;tage of the fe|ver for a common cold. The mi&s;take is a natural one; for, it comes on like a cold, and is frequently excited by cool, or cold air. This remark is intended to produce applications for medical aid as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible after feeling the lea&s;t &s;ymp|tom of indi&s;po&s;ition at the pre&s;ent juncture.</P>
<P>In the forming &s;tate of the fever, when the patient feels &s;lightly indi&s;po&s;ed, and before he is confined to his bed, the following remedies generally check the di&s;ea&s;e:</P>
<P>A purge of &s;alts, ca&s;tor oil, or a do&s;e of jalap and calomel. If the&s;e fail of giving relief, a gentle &s;weat &s;hould be excited in the u&s;ual way. If there be much pain in the head or back, and the pul&s;e be full, or ten&s;e, ten or twelve ounces of blood &s;hould be lo&s;t, before the u&s;e of the &s;weat, and either before or after taking the purge. Entire re&s;t from bu&s;ine&s;s and ex|erci&s;e of all kinds will be nece&s;&s;ary to give efficacy to the above remedies.</P>
<P>If the exi&s;tence of the di&s;ea&s;e were more early, and more generally admitted, and the remedies which have been re|commended, u&s;ed before the fever was completely formed, there are the &s;tronge&s;t rea&s;ons to believe there would be much le&s;s mortality from it.</P>
<P>After the di&s;ea&s;e is formed, and appears with more or le&s;s of the following &s;ymptoms, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> chills, great heat, head-ache, a redne&s;s in the eyes, &s;ickne&s;s at the &s;tomach, vomiting, pains in the back, limbs and bowels, &amp;c. the following remedies are proper.</P>
<P N="1">1. The lo&s;s of ten or twelve ounces of blood, two or three times a-day, while the pul&s;e continues to be full, or ten&s;e. If the pul&s;e &s;hould be &s;lower, and apparently weaker than natu|ral, it calls for bleeding as much as it does when it di&s;covers preternatural fulne&s;s and ten&s;ion.</P>
<P N="2">2. The bowels &s;hould be purged, at the &s;ame time, with ca|lomel mixed with jalap or rhubarb, in powders or in pills.&mdash;The operation of this purging medicine &s;hould be aided, when practicable, by cly&s;ters, compo&s;ed of half an ounce of
<PB N="69" REF="035335_0068_1001FEADD012FD80">
glauber &s;alts, di&s;&s;olved in half a pint of warm water, or of half a pint of warm water with &s;weet oil, mola&s;&s;es, and common &s;alt, of each a table-&s;poonful, in it.</P>
<P>The bowels &s;hould be kept gently open through the whole cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, by means of the above cly&s;ters, and any other gently purging medicine.</P>
<P N="3">3. If the &s;tomach &s;hould be &s;ick and oppre&s;&s;ed with bile, a vomit of ipecacuana, or tartar emetic may be given at any time on the 3d or 4th day of the di&s;ea&s;e, provided the pul&s;e has been reduced by previous bleeding and purging. From five to ten drops of laudanum may be given to compo&s;e the &s;tomach if the vomit &s;hould operate more than three or four times.</P>
<P N="4">4. Calomel &s;hould be given from the beginning, in do&s;es of from two to five grains, every two hours, in order to ex|cite a &s;alivation. If the calomel &s;hould purge more than two or three times a-day, four or five drops of laudanum may be given two or three times a-day, in order to confine the calomel to the bowels, and thereby to determine it to the mouth and throat. We have &s;een no death where this me|dicine has produced a &s;alivation.</P>
<P N="5">5. After the pul&s;e is reduced by bleeding and purging, if the di&s;ea&s;e has not yielded, a profu&s;e &s;weat &s;hould be excited by wrapping the patient up in blankets, with five or &s;ix hot bricks wetted with vinegar applied to different parts of his body, and giving him at the &s;ame time large and repeated draughts, of hot camomile or &s;age tea, hot lemonade or weak punch, or any other hot liquor that is agreeable to him, to drink. This &s;weat &s;hould be continued <HI>but</HI> FOUR or FIVE hours at a TIME, and but ONCE in the twenty-four hours. If the patient &s;hould become fainty, during the u&s;e of this excellent remedy, it &s;hould be di&s;continued for a few hours, but renewed (under the circum&s;tances above mentioned) if the di&s;ea&s;e &s;hould continue.</P>
<P N="6">6. Bli&s;ters &s;hould be applied to the wri&s;ts and ankles, in common ca&s;es, about the third or fourth day of the fever, if the pul&s;e be reduced, or the &s;ickne&s;s at &s;tomach is trouble|&s;ome. If the head be much affected, a bli&s;ter &s;hould be ap|plied to the neck or to the crown of the head, fir&s;t cutting off the hair and &s;having it, and if the &s;tomach &s;hould be much affected after the third or fourth day a large bli&s;ter &s;hould be applied to it.</P>
<P N="7">7. In ca&s;e of delirium with a languid pul&s;e, poultices of raw garlic, with a little mu&s;tard, &s;hould be applied to the feet,</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="70" REF="035335_0069_10023268C6B75858">
8. Fre&s;h air &s;hould be admitted into &s;ick rooms at all times, and cool air in the beginning of the fever, when the &s;kin is hot, and the pul&s;e full and ten&s;e. In this &s;tate of the fever, the hands, feet and face &s;hould be wa&s;hed, ten or twelve times a-day, with cold water. In a cool &s;tate of the &s;kin, or when the body is covered with &s;weat, cool air and cold water are improper.</P>
<P N="9">9. The body and bed linen of the &s;ick &s;hould be frequent|ly changed, and all offen&s;ive matters, di&s;charged from them, &s;hould be in&s;tantly removed.</P>
<P>In ca&s;es of great weakne&s;s, the patient &s;hould not be per|mitted to ri&s;e from his bed when under the operation of purg|ing phy&s;ic, nor upon any other occa&s;ion.</P>
<P N="10">10. The drinks of &s;ick people, in the beginning of the fe|ver, &s;hould be toa&s;t and water, tamarind water, lemonade, currant jelly, di&s;&s;olved in water, apple water or barley water. In the latter &s;tage of the fever, the drinks may be porter and water, claret and water, milk and water, or camomile tea.</P>
<P>Weak tea and coffee may be taken in the beginning of the fever. In its &s;econd &s;tage, the patient may eat bread and milk, with roa&s;ted apples, or &s;oft peaches, chocolate, &s;ago, ta|pioca, ripe fruits, weak chicken or veal broth, and a little boiled chicken.</P>
<P>It will be improper to depend exclu&s;ively upon any one of the above remedies. The combined force of them, all is barely &s;ufficient, in many ca&s;es, to overcome this formidable di&s;ea&s;e.</P>

<P><HI>How to e&s;cape the Yellow-Fever, now prevalent in Philadelphia:</HI> Addre&s;&s;ed particularly to tho&s;e citizens who&s;e circum&s;tances will not permit them to comply with the recommenda|tions of the Managers of the Marine and City Ho&s;pitals.</P>
<P>The fever, which at this time prevails in our unfortunate city and &s;uburbs, is the very &s;ame, in kind, as that which pre|vailed in '93 and '97, occa&s;ioned by imported contagion, and was introduced into it, for want of efficient health-laws, and the proper regulation of quarantines, as I propo&s;e to make appear in a future paper.</P>
<P>This contagion, however, appears, from numerous ob&s;er|vations, and the mo&s;t authentic facts, to be capable of pro|ducing fever, only under <HI>particular</HI> circum&s;tances: the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances,
<PB N="71" REF="035335_0070_1002326A54562570">
removed or avoided, the contagion becomes in|active and harmle&s;s.</P>
<P>This fever had not been ob&s;erved to exi&s;t in Philadelphia, for more than thirty years, before the year '93&mdash;and has ne|ver been known to exi&s;t in the winter &s;ea&s;on in this climate; differing in this re&s;pect, from tho&s;e contagious fevers that are bred in jails, ho&s;pitals and pri&s;on &s;hips; but perfectly re|&s;embling the plagues which have been introduced at different times into different maritime towns in Europe from certain parts of Africa, and the Turki&s;h dominions in Europe bor|dering upon A&s;ia.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tances which render the contagion of the yel|low fever active, and favour its &s;preading or becoming epi|demic, appear to be, hot, rarified and &s;tagnant, or confined air, more e&s;pecially when replete and altered in its &s;alutary quality by putrid exhalations from dead vegetable and ani|mal &s;ub&s;tances. Under the recited circum&s;tances, the majori|ty of tho&s;e who approach very near to, or come in contact with the &s;ick, &s;o as to receive the exhalations emitted by the lungs or &s;kin, become in the cour&s;e of a few days, mo&s;t com|monly on the fifth or &s;ixth day after &s;uch expo&s;ure, affected with the &s;ame kind of fever; but as all that approach within the &s;ame di&s;tance to the &s;ick, do not afterwards take the di&s;|ea&s;e, though they have received the contagious particles into their bodies, it implies that their con&s;titutions are not di&s;po|&s;ed to favour its operation; that is, that they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a power to re&s;i&s;t its action or impre&s;&s;ion, or that the contagion mixing with the fluids in the &s;tomach, or with tho&s;e in the arteries, pa&s;&s;es out again, with &s;ome of the u&s;ual excretions.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tances, which, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, appear to give ef|fect to the contagion, &s;o as to produce fever, after it has been received into the circulation, through the medium of the &s;to|mach, lungs or &s;kin, appear to be &s;uch as have the power of inducing &s;udden and great debility in the &s;everal functions of the body, and con&s;equent &s;pa&s;m or con&s;triction of the ex|treme ve&s;&s;els, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Among the chief of the&s;e, may be reckoned, &s;udden expo|&s;ure to cold, after great fatigue, or after being greatly heated by exerci&s;e, and expo&s;ure to the &s;corching rays of the &s;un.</P>
<P>Intemperance, &s;ucceeded by ab&s;tinence, frequent blood let|ting, purging, fa&s;ting, and con&s;tant terror or dread of the di&s;|ea&s;e, have all a &s;imilar effect. Whereas, moderate and refre&s;h|ing exerci&s;e, the temperate u&s;e of &s;uch nouri&s;hing food as has no tendency to &s;timulate or inflame, and rather to pre&s;erve

the bowels laxative than otherwi&s;e, and the temperate u&s;e of diluted fermented liquors, particularly found bottled porter and claret, have the mo&s;t &s;alutary effect in preventing the ope|ration of the contagion, and al&s;o of rendering the di&s;ea&s;e milder and more manageable by the phy&s;ician, when it does attack, than when it occurs in tho&s;e previou&s;ly debilitated.</P>
<P>The air in the open &s;treets, I believe, never becomes &s;uf|ficiently contaminated by the contagious particles (let the pa|tients be ever &s;o numerous in the hou&s;es) to communicate the di&s;ea&s;e to any per&s;on walking in the middle of the &s;treet, or even on the pavements, when the wind blows from the oppo&s;ite &s;ide. This is a fact not only confirmed by the ob|&s;ervations of the judicious and accurate Dr. Ru&s;&s;el, in his account of a pe&s;tilential fever at Aleppo, and by all the phy|&s;icians that have publi&s;hed an account of the di&s;ea&s;e, as it has appeared in different parts of Europe, but is al&s;o e&s;tabli&s;hed by the events of la&s;t year, and by tho&s;e of '93.</P>
<P>In the year '93, all the pri&s;oners in the jail of Philadelphia, amounting to more than 200; the pri&s;oners in the alm&s;|hou&s;e; and the patients in the Penn&s;ylvania ho&s;pital, e&s;caped the di&s;ea&s;e, owing to the precaution of preventing the admi&s;|&s;ion of any &s;ick or &s;u&s;picious per&s;on, as well as every infected article into tho&s;e places.</P>
<P>All the families, al&s;o, that remained in the city and con|fined them&s;elves and their dome&s;tics &s;trictly to their own hou&s;es, and &s;uffered no &s;ick per&s;on, or any one lately recover|ed from the di&s;order, or any material from an infected hou&s;e, to come near them; and employed &s;ome tru&s;ty per&s;on to furni&s;h them with marketing and other nece&s;&s;aries, from &s;ources free from infection, e&s;caped the di&s;ea&s;e without ex|ception. This was al&s;o the ca&s;e with all the farmers that at|tended the market, that cautiou&s;ly avoided &s;leeping at, or go|ing into any of the chambers of the taverns, or places where they put up. This could not have been the ca&s;e, if the whole atmo&s;phere of the city had been tainted, or replete with noxi|ous exhalations.</P>
<P>By ob&s;erving the preceding rules and cautions, therefore, tho&s;e inhabitants who cannot procure a retreat in the coun|try, may certainly pre&s;erve them&s;elves from taking the fever.</P>
<P>The&s;e are con&s;olatory facts, drawn from experienced ob|&s;ervers; and they are facts that may be fitly oppo&s;ed to the popular notions of contagion, &s;o apt to affect the imagination in moments of con&s;ternation and di&s;may.</P>
<P>Before I conclude, I think it proper to add, that I have

frequently &s;een per&s;ons, who&s;e office it is to attend the &s;ick, e&s;cape the di&s;ea&s;e in large airy apartments, without ob&s;erv|ing any precaution at all; but have &s;eldom ob&s;erved this to be the ca&s;e in &s;mall confined places unfavourable for ventila|tion, e&s;pecially where the circum&s;tances of the patient, would not admit of daily changes of the bed and body linen. Clean|line&s;s, daily changes of apparel, and free ventilation appear, therefore, to be e&s;&s;ential for preventing the contagious and malignant effects of the fever.</P>
<P>Perhaps if phy&s;icians and nur&s;es were &s;tudiou&s;ly to guard again&s;t breathing when near the patient, and were never to &s;wallow their &s;aliva; (by which it is probable the contagion is more frequently conveyed into the body than by any other means) were careful to rince their mouths with cold water and vinegar, brandy and water or wine, and frequently to chew &s;ome agreeable aromatic &s;ub&s;tance; were never to ap|proach the &s;ick with an empty &s;tomach, and were to rub half a drachm or a drachm of mercurial ointment upon their limbs every night till it occa&s;ioned tenderne&s;s of the mouth, it would prevent the contagion from operating, or at lea&s;t ren|der the di&s;ea&s;e much more mild and manageable when it did occur.</P>

<P>About the 12th or 14th of September, the di&s;ea&s;e began to appear among the convicts in the criminals' jail. One died on the 17th, and two more on the 18th, and &s;everal were lying &s;ick. In con&s;equence of which, the vagrant and untried
<PB N="76" REF="035335_0075_1001FEB97052E150">
criminals, male and female, were removed to Morris's Buil|dings. The whole number of pri&s;oners in the jail, at this time, including debtors, was about three hundred.</P>
<P>On the 18th, &s;everal of them attempted to make their e&s;cape by force, in ab&s;ence of the jailor. Perhaps they were part|ly led to this ra&s;h act, to avoid the contagion which was then raging in the jail, and perhaps becau&s;e there was little dan|ger of being taken, from the unprotected &s;tate of the city. But, in this project, they were fru&s;trated, by the undaunted vigilance of Robert Wharton, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> then one of the alder|men of the city, now mayor, with a few a&s;&s;i&s;tants; two of the criminals were &s;hot, and one wounded with a bayonet before the re&s;t &s;urrendered.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the above proceedings, and the &s;everal robberies, which had been committed; a number of the ci|tizens formed them&s;elves into an a&s;&s;ociation, for the protec|tion of the city, during this de&s;erted and unprotected period. Their proceedings will be noticed in the next chapter.</P>
<P>The Board of Health, in order to remove, if po&s;&s;ible, the aver&s;ion retained again&s;t the City Ho&s;pital, and to induce the &s;ick, who were de&s;titute of the conveniencies which their &s;ituation required, to con&s;ent to be taken to the Ho&s;pital, publi&s;hed the following comparative &s;tatement between the mortality at the City Ho&s;pital, and that of the City and Li|berties:</P>

<P>About the 21&s;t of September, the fever fir&s;t appeared in the Penn&s;ylvania Ho&s;pital. It is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been introduced by one of the nur&s;es, who brought &s;ome clothes from the city a few days previous.</P>
<P>The repeated robberies and thefts, induced the corpora|tion to double the number of ordinary watchmen; who, in junction with the patrols, appointed by the citizens, con|tinued to guard the city both day and night.</P>
<P>On the 22d of September, a number of the members of the &s;ociety of Friends held their annual meeting; but ad|journed, on account of the fever, till December.

22d of Sept. On the evening and night of the 27th, there was a great fall of rain, which &s;uddenly cooled the air. Pro|bably, in con&s;equence of this, the mortality on the &s;ucceed|ing day was greater than at any other period of the fever. One hundred and &s;ix per&s;ons were interred.</P>
<P>By comparing the tables of new ca&s;es, and of mortality, &amp;c. as annexed, with the regi&s;ter of the weather, it will be found, that both new ca&s;es and deaths were augmented in con&s;equence of either rainy, damp, or &s;udden cool weather; but, that in a day or two afterwards, both were dimini&s;hed.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Summary of the proceedings at the City Ho&s;pital&mdash;Encampments on the Schuylkill, and Ma&s;ters's place&mdash;A&s;&s;ociation for the protection of the city&mdash;Robbery of the bank&mdash;Proceedings in the jail&mdash;and at different parts of the union, during the ca|lamity.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>HAVING, in the preceding pages, traced the ri&s;e, pro|gre&s;s, and decline of the di&s;ea&s;e, we now proceed, in a &s;um|mary manner, to mention &s;ome occurrences, which could not be previou&s;ly noticed, without interfering with the ge|neral connection of &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t important proceedings of the Board of Health, we have thought proper to notice, as they are replete with information to the various &s;tages of the calamity.&mdash;No cla&s;s or body of men were of more &s;ervice to the city, throughout the whole gloomy period, than the&s;e individuals.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The members who remained at their po&s;ts, and who merit the gratitude of the public, are recorded in page 63. It includes the whole Board, except Me&s;&s;rs. John Newbold, and James Wood. After the e&s;tabli&s;hment of tents at Ma&s;ters's place, Mr. John In&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eep pre&s;ided there.</NOTE> Their indefatigable exertions&mdash;their arrangements in the city, and at the City Ho&s;pital, with tho&s;e of the Over&s;eers and Guar|dians of the poor, for alleviating di&s;tre&s;s, were judicious and &s;alutary. It was the general cu&s;tom of the Board to meet and deliberate every morning at 11 o'clock. They framed the regulations for the management of the City Ho&s;pital, and &s;aw that they were properly executed. Me&s;&s;rs. William Jones, William Daw&s;on, and (previous to his death) I&s;aac Price, were the members who mo&s;t frequently vi&s;ited the Ho&s;pital for this purpo&s;e. The burial of the dead was like|wi&s;e conducted by the regulations of the Board: they pro|vided coffins, hear&s;es, &amp;c. Mo&s;t of the coffins (rough pine boxes) were made in the jail by convicts. In the height of the di&s;ea&s;e, the deaths were &s;o numerous, that the Board found it nece&s;&s;ary to employ common carts: the number of
<PB N="83" REF="035335_0082_1001FE87036E1128">
hear&s;es were inadequate; and even, with this a&s;&s;i&s;tance, they were frequently under the nece&s;&s;ity of conveying the dead to the grave in the &s;ame coachees which carried the &s;ick to the Ho&s;pital. Two, and even three bodies were often car|ried together: about twelve hear&s;es and carts, and three coachees, were in con&s;tant employ. An improvement was made, for the more ea&s;y conveyance of the &s;ick patients, in the advanced &s;tage of their &s;ickne&s;s. They could not be re|moved, without injury, in the coachees. The Board cau&s;ed three &s;wing carriages to be made, by which the &s;ick could lay at their whole length in a bed, &s;u&s;pended from the &s;hafts, between the wheels. Thus, they were conveyed with &s;uch ea&s;e, as ameliorated &s;ome of the former con&s;equent di&s;tre&s;&s;es, without being di&s;turbed by the jolting of the carriage. The carriages, with hor&s;es, &s;tood always ready, in the <HI>old</HI> Potter's Field.</P>

<P>The City Ho&s;pital &s;tands on a low, flat piece of ground, on the ea&s;t bank of the Schuylkill, in Sa&s;&s;afras-&s;treet; with a tract of mar&s;hy ground in front: The &s;ituation cannot be healthy. Formerly it was occupied for a tavern, when the &s;ummer-hou&s;es, in the garden, were erected.&mdash;The build|ings, for the accommodation of the &s;ick, con&s;i&s;t of two large frame hou&s;es: their form is an oblong &s;quare, two &s;tories high. The large&s;t was erected, during the prevalence of the la&s;t calamity, when the other was inadequate to contain the number of &s;ick. The &s;ummer-hou&s;es were covered with canva&s;s, and a few &s;mall &s;heds were erected for the con|vale&s;cent. There are al&s;o &s;tables and other out-hou&s;es.&mdash;The management of the ho&s;pital was entru&s;ted to the phy&s;icians, a &s;teward and a matron, under the in&s;pection of the Board of Health. It was opened for the reception of the &s;ick about the 8th of Augu&s;t. They were placed under the care of Drs. Phy&s;ick and Cooper; gentlemen, eminent for medical &s;kill and goodne&s;s of heart.&mdash;They made a voluntary offer of their &s;ervices to the Board.&mdash;There Dr. Cooper died, a vic|tim to the contagion, much regretted. Dr. Ru&s;h a&s;&s;i&s;ted as con|&s;ulting phy&s;ician, and Drs. May and Watt were appointed to compound the medicines, &amp;c. From the 6th of September, and to the 6th of October, there were never le&s;s than one hundred patients in the Ho&s;pital, nor more than one hundred and &s;ixty-four.&mdash;Medicine, fruit, wine, changes of linen, and
<PB N="84" REF="035335_0083_10023181B02A1FB8">
every other article, nece&s;&s;ary for relief, comfort, and accom|modation, were amply provided.</P>
<P>The &s;cenes of di&s;tre&s;s which the Ho&s;pital exhibited, were truly di&s;mal:&mdash;there we could hear the groans&mdash;the moan|ings&mdash;and the heavy &s;ighs of "the hundreds &s;ick." No con|nexions were near to view their di&s;tre&s;s, or to &s;oothe, with the tear of friend&s;hip, their "little hour." When the coachees, which brought out the &s;ick, arrived, often might be &s;een an affrightened patient enter, &s;upported by &s;trange Nur&s;es, and bedewing his or her cheeks with tears. The nur&s;es were often obliged to hold the patient in bed by force, when &s;truggling with delirium, and others &s;eemed to &s;leep out their life with|out any feeling, while the &s;creams of many were heard at a di&s;tance. Some bled from the mouth and no&s;e, and the black vomit i&s;&s;ued, in &s;treams, from others. Two, and frequently three, were placed in one coffin.</P>
<P>The men and women occupied different wards. Particu|lar attention was paid by the nur&s;es to the &s;ick, both day and night.&mdash;No complaints have been made; but letters of thanks have frequently been &s;ent to the phy&s;icians and managers for kind treatment and attention.</P>
<P>Few of the nur&s;es at the Ho&s;pital were attacked with the di&s;ea&s;e, although expo&s;ed to concentrated contagion. It was often cu&s;tomary for them to &s;leep on the &s;ame bed with the &s;ick, and &s;ome have been known to &s;wallow a portion of the juices of the &s;ick, without experiencing any injury.&mdash;Dr. Phy&s;ick informed us, that he has frequently &s;een a nur&s;e helping a patient to a &s;poonful of food, and taking another, her&s;elf, alternately: that he has al&s;o &s;een them eat the fruit that has been gnawed by the &s;ick. One or two in&s;tances occurred of wives nur&s;ing their hu&s;bands in the Ho&s;pital, and mothers their children; none of which took the di&s;ea&s;e, tho' lying on the &s;ame bed. During the whole period of the &s;ickne&s;s, there were 899<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the tables of daily returns.</NOTE> per&s;ons admitted into the Ho&s;pital, of which 518 died.</P>
<P>The City Ho&s;pital burial-ground, was the general recep|tacle for the dead, from the beginning of Augu&s;t to the fir&s;t of November. Graves were dug, at the commencement of the calamity, for every corp&s;e; but, afterwards, two or three were put into one pit. The accumulated mortality, which commenced about the end of Augu&s;t, rendered this mode
<PB N="85" REF="035335_0084_10023184C282CE98">
impracticable. A more expeditious method of interment was adopted. A large trench was dug, in which the cof|fins were piled upon each other. It was conducted in &s;uch a manner, that the fre&s;h mould, dug from one end, covered the dead in another; while the hear&s;es were drove to the bottom of the trench, where they depo&s;ited the bodies. In two of the&s;e trenches, upwards of fifteen hundred were in|terred; twelve or fourteen diggers were employed. They remained, as ob&s;erved before, in the field, night and day. Sheds were con&s;tructed for their accommodation. Some were buried in this ground, who are not mentioned in our li&s;t. It was not unfrequent for the grave-diggers to find a dead body in the morning, which had been thrown over the fence during the preceding night.</P>
<P>After mo&s;t of the citizens, who&s;e circum&s;tances would permit, had fled to the country, the poor began, generally, to &s;uffer, and the di&s;ea&s;e &s;u&s;tained no abatement. It rather con|tinued to &s;pread, and little hope remained that it would ter|minate, until it &s;hould be de&s;troyed by fro&s;t. A removal of the healthy was the only hope left for its mitigation. The Board of Health, in junction with the Guardians of the Poor, concerted mea&s;ures for the con&s;truction of temporary tents. The&s;e were &s;oon afterwards erected on the banks of Schuyl|kill, between Spruce and Che&s;nut-&s;treets. They were ready by the 24th of Augu&s;t, where fugitives crouded. A certifi|cate was nece&s;&s;ary, to gain admi&s;&s;ion, from &s;ome re&s;pectable citizen, with an application to any of the following gentle|men, who were appointed a joint committee from the Board of Health and Guardians of the Poor to &s;uperintend this en|campment: Peter Mierken, I&s;aac Price, James Oldden, John Kehr.</P>
<P>They crouded, in the greate&s;t abundance, from the &s;outh parts of the City and Southwark: They were accommodated with every nece&s;&s;ary of life, principally from the donations of the opulent. The tents were made of canva&s;s, and floored with boards. Here nineteen hundred and fifty per&s;ons were fed, and &s;ome of them cloathed! While we admire the liberality of the public, which was di&s;played on this occa|&s;ion, we are induced to mention, that in many in&s;tances, ad|vantages were taken. Many &s;ordid &s;ouls removed, and were fed and cloathed, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed independent re&s;ources. The names of freeholders, who hold property to the amount of &s;everal thou&s;ands of dollars, could be mentioned, who here
<PB N="86" REF="035335_0085_10023186518AD070">
robbed the poor of their pittance. The liberal hand mu&s;t move reluctant, under an idea of &s;uch a diabolical practice. Credit is due to the committee who &s;uperintended this e&s;tabli&s;hment, for both their attention and trouble. The rules which they fra|med were judicious, and well adapted to the &s;ituation and man|ners of each cla&s;s. Some, as might naturally be &s;uppo&s;ed, were not the mo&s;t orderly; &s;uch were either &s;ent to Morris's Build|ings, or confined in a temporary pri&s;on, at the encampment. Guards were &s;tationed with arms, to pre&s;erve order, and pre|vent any individuals from tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing the rules. Schools, for the in&s;truction of children, were in&s;tituted; at which 137 male, and 143 female children, attended. The hearty men were employed, in digging the canal. Public wor&s;hip was performed on Sundays; and medical advice, and attendance was given by Dr. S. Du&s;&s;ield.</P>
<P>About the beginning of November, the committee were in need of cloathing for infants. They publi&s;hed the fol|lowing:</P>

<P>About the beginning of September, another encampment was erected at Ma&s;ters' Place, near the Mill-Pond, on the road to Germantown, about two miles from the city, for the &s;ame benevolent purpo&s;e as that on the Schuylkill; to which the fugitives, principally from the Northern-Liberties and Ken&s;ington, flocked. John In&s;keep, Jonathan Robe&s;on, and I&s;aac W. Morris, were appointed a committee for its &s;uper|intendance. It was compo&s;ed of wooden &s;heds, comforta|ble, convenient, and, in every re&s;pect, adapted to the occa&s;ion; e&s;pecially when it is con&s;idered that they were erected in eight or ten days, and accommodated upwards of <HI>two thou&s;and per&s;ons.</HI> Be&s;ides the lodging-&s;heds, there were erect|ed an ho&s;pital, a large &s;tore-hou&s;e, and office, a bake-hou&s;e and oven, and five kitchens, with eight large fire-places. This encampment was &s;ituated on a well-cho&s;en &s;pot, and laid out in regular order: the &s;treets inter&s;ected each other. The rules and regulations, which were printed and po&s;ted up in different places in the encampment, do honour to the committee. Spirituous liquors were prohibited, except in ca&s;es of &s;uppo&s;ed nece&s;&s;ity. Slight offences were puni&s;hed, by withholding provi&s;ions for a rea&s;onable time; and, for tho&s;e of a more aggravated nature, the offender was expelled. All
<PB N="88" REF="035335_0087_1002318CD3105730">
intercour&s;e with the city was cut off, except on urgent occa|&s;ions. This was enforced, by placing centinels, at proper di&s;|tances, around the encampment. Scavengers were appoint|ed, who&s;e duty it was, every morning, to remove all the filth, and to throw fre&s;h earth into the nece&s;&s;aries; and, in every other re&s;pect, the utmo&s;t attention was paid to cleanline&s;s. They were abundantly &s;upplied with provi&s;ions of every kind; the arrangement for the delivery of the rations was well plan|ned, and the mo&s;t &s;crupulous regard to ju&s;tice ob&s;erved in the di&s;tribution. The decorum, which was &s;o eminently maintained in the encampment, among&s;t characters, too, &s;ome of which were not the mo&s;t amiable, reflect great honour both on the &s;uperintendants, and the example of many virtu|ous families, who re&s;ided there. The fir&s;t public addre&s;s of the &s;uperintendants was on the 10th of September: they in|formed the public, that they &s;tood in need of vegetables, &s;traw, &amp;c. for the u&s;e of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed citizens, who had ta|ken refuge there; and they hoped that they would experience the &s;ame liberality which had been extended to the Schuylkill encampment; having the &s;ame laudable object in view. This public intimation produced an abundant &s;upply. On the 28th of the &s;ame month, the committee publicly ac|knowledged, that the liberality which they had experienced, &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all expectation: that &s;everal villages and neigh|bourhoods in New-Jer&s;ey, had been eminently bountiful on this occa&s;ion; that the &s;upplies which they had occa&s;ionally received, had been abundant, <HI>except in articles of cloathing:</HI> they had received &s;ome very hand&s;ome donations in that line; but not in &s;ufficient abundance to &s;upply their pre&s;&s;ing and numerous wants: that the number, under their care, was daily encrea&s;ing, and already amounted to upwards of <HI>thirteen hundred per&s;ons,</HI> compo&s;ed of both &s;exes, from one hour to eighty years old; but, that the greater proportion of them, were helple&s;s women and children. About two hundred of the children were at the brea&s;t, the mothers of whom were generally without &s;hoe or &s;tocking. The committee &s;ug|ge&s;ted, that lin&s;ey, flannels, and woollen &s;tockings, would be particularly acceptable, as well as every de&s;cription of &s;e|cond-hand and ready-made cloathing. From this period, the li&s;ts of donations &s;welled with individual bounty. Our ci|tizens &s;eemed to vie with each other who &s;hould be the mo&s;t liberal. Drs. Currie and Dewees, gratuitou&s;ly offered their &s;ervices to the committee. Great attention and care was be&s;towed upon the &s;ick in this encampment, which
<PB N="89" REF="035335_0088_1002318F27727708">
was numerous. A few had the yellow fever. The&s;e gentle|men received a public declaration of thanks from the committee.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of this encampment returned to their homes, generally, about the 1&s;t of November; but not before they had publi&s;hed a grateful and affectionate tribute of laudable prai&s;e to their meritorious committee.</P>

<P>It is a melancholy truth, that the mo&s;t awful afflictions which befal our fellow-creatures, are not &s;ufficient to awa|ken, in &s;ome minds, even the feelings of &s;ympathy. Callous to every &s;entiment of humanity, and dead to every principle of virtue, &s;ome wretches, who, to the eternal di&s;grace of the human character, were &s;o totally depraved, that while walking even "in the valley of the &s;hadow of death," medi|tated and committed the mo&s;t abominable crimes. While every virtuous mind was filled with &s;ympathetic &s;orrow for that general gloom, which hovered over the city, there were vil|lains lurking about, watching every opportunity, during the ab&s;ence of the citizens, to commit robbery on their de&s;erted hou&s;es. Notwith&s;tanding that the number of ordinary watch|men had been augmented, and patrols appointed to watch it during the day, &s;everal robberies were committed. The bank of Penn&s;ylvania, as ob&s;erved before, was robbed; and attempts were made by the pri&s;oners in the cri|minals jail to e&s;cape. A con&s;ideration of the&s;e circum|&s;tances, and the general unguarded &s;tate of the city, indu|ced a number of private citizens, to a&s;&s;ociate for the purpo&s;e of affording it better protection.</P>

<P>The a&s;&s;ociation informed the public, that their intentions were merely to have a body of men ready to turn out, armed and equipped, on any &s;udden emergency, or to mount guard at any of the pri&s;ons, or el&s;ewhere, if nece&s;&s;ary; by thus being ready with arms and ammunition, to repair, at the fir&s;t notice, to their re&s;pective alarm po&s;ts, that they might act with the greate&s;t promptitude and efficiency, and that the civil magi&s;|trates and other good citizens might know where to find a body of men, prepared, to enforce a due obedience to the laws, and pre&s;erve order and tranquility.</P>
<P>The citizens were informed that in ca&s;es of fire, or riot in the city, the <HI>old</HI> Potter's-Field was cho&s;en as the alarm po&s;t, or rallying point, from its central &s;ituation, and con|tiguity to both jails and Morris's Building, then the place of confinement for vagrants; in the Northern Liberties, the city-hall or town-hou&s;e; and in Southwark, Little's &s;chool hou&s;e, to which all the members of the a&s;&s;ociation were to re|pair equipped, and there await the orders or pre&s;ence of their own officers, a magi&s;trate, or other civil officer.</P>
<P>The alarm was to be given by firing a field piece.</P>

<HEAD>Robbery of the Bank of Penn&s;ylvania.</HEAD>
<P>On the night of the 4th of Augu&s;t, &s;ome villains entered the bank, and made an un&s;ucce&s;sful attempt to force open the doors of the ca&s;h vault, and to pick the lock of an iron che&s;t; but the in&s;titution &s;u&s;tained no lo&s;s; as it was apprehended that the attempt would be renewed, and con&s;idering the in|&s;ecurity of the building, and the impo&s;&s;ibility of making &s;uch repairs to it as would render it &s;afe, the porters were armed, and directed to &s;leep in the banking-hou&s;e, in order to guard again&s;t the &s;ucce&s;s of future attempts. The immediate re|moval of the bank to Carpenter's-hall was propo&s;ed. This building, from its con&s;truction, and the improvements which had been made to it, when in the occupancy of the Bank of the United States, was thought perfectly &s;ecure; but previ|ou&s;ly to the removal, which took place on the Saturday fol|lowing, a new patent lock was put to the outer door, and two
<PB N="91" REF="035335_0090_100231BA491E8C88">
iron doors were fitted to the ca&s;h vault, with locks which had been u&s;ed for the book vault, and which were of a better con|&s;truction than any which could at that time be procured in the city. The precaution of obliging the porters to &s;leep in the Bank was continued, and the watchmen were charged to be particularly vigilant.</P>
<P>Thomas Cunningham, the porter, who is &s;ince dead, &s;lept there alone, and early in the morning of Sunday the 2d of September, Mr. Anne&s;ley, the runner, having occa&s;ion to go to the Bank, found the back door of the banking hou&s;e open; and looking into the banking room, he di&s;covered the doors of the back vault likewi&s;e open. He immediately rou&s;ed Cunningham, who was a&s;leep up &s;tairs; they found all the windows &s;ecured, the back door unbarred, and the doors of the ca&s;h vault unlocked. Upon an examination of the hou&s;e, it was found that the locks had been opened by fal&s;e keys, for no injury was done to the wards of any of them, nor was there any appearance of force having been u&s;ed.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s which the in&s;titution had &s;u&s;tained, amounted to <HI>one hundred and &s;ixty-two thou&s;and eight hundred and twenty-one dollars and &s;ixty-one cents.</HI></P>
<P>Every exertion was made to di&s;cover the perpetrators of this flagrant robbery. Adverti&s;ements were publi&s;hed throughout the United States, cautioning the public again&s;t the receipt of the po&s;t-notes &s;tolen. Con&s;iderable rewards were offered for the apprehen&s;ion of tho&s;e concerned in the robbery, in addition to that of <HI>one thou&s;and dollars,</HI> promi&s;ed in the governor's proclamation. "Several per&s;ons were ar|re&s;ted upon &s;u&s;picion, and among&s;t tho&s;e was Patrick Lyon, the &s;mith, who was employed in fitting the iron doors of the ca&s;h vault, <HI>and without who&s;e privity it is believed this robbery has not been committed.</HI>"</P>
<P>After uncea&s;ing vigilance they had the &s;atisfaction to di&s;|cover the perpetrator of this daring robbery, &s;o that the whole amount of the property &s;tolen was recovered, except about three thou&s;and two hundred dollars.</P>
<P>One I&s;aac Davis, a carpenter, had an account open in this bank: The fir&s;t circum&s;tance which excited &s;u&s;picions a|gain&s;t him, was a depo&s;it of 16,000 dollars. Enquiry was made re&s;pecting his circum&s;tances and character, which were found to be &s;uch, as to induce the officers of the bank to watch his conduct. On the 17th of November, he made another depo&s;it of 3,910 dollars. The &s;u&s;picions were now increa&s;ed, and it was thought proper to enquire at the other
<PB N="92" REF="035335_0091_100231BC0DF833D0">
banks, whether he had made any depo&s;its with them? when &s;uch information was obtained, as left no doubt but that he was the robber. He was then apprehended, and, partly by threats, and partly by promi&s;e of an interce&s;&s;ion with the go|vernor for his pardon, the confe&s;&s;ion of his guilt was extor|ted from him.</P>
<P>His di&s;clo&s;ures criminated only Thomas Cunningham, the late porter, and him&s;elf; for, he repeatedly declared, that they alone were concerned in the robbery. It was remarked, that Thomas Cunningham &s;lept in the bank the night that the robbery was committed, and that he was taken ill of the yellow fever the day after and died in the cour&s;e of the week. Davis &s;aid that they had divided the money &s;tolen, and that the depo&s;its he had made in the different banks, were part of his &s;hare. He a&s;&s;ured them that he had re|turned all he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, and that the remainder of the property &s;tolen, would be found at the hou&s;e where Cun|ningham died. They &s;earched the hou&s;e de&s;cribed, but with|out &s;ucce&s;s. Davis was informed that unle&s;s he made a full di&s;clo&s;ure, he would be committed to pri&s;on, and his hou&s;e &s;earched: By threats and promi&s;es, he acknowledged that he had vi&s;ited Cunningham the day he was taken ill, and had received from him the remainder of the money &s;tolen, a great part of which he had &s;till &s;ecreted. They had then re|covered in all 158<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">999 dollars and 53 cents: Davis al&s;o a&s;|&s;igned over property which had co&s;t him a &s;hort time before 800 dollars.</P>
<P>Davis declared that the plan of the robbery originated with Cunningham, who procured the fal&s;e keys, and that he does not know who made them.</P>
<P>The tenor of this is taken from the report of the commit|tee, of the State A&s;&s;embly, who were appointed-to make en|quiry on the &s;ubject. They received their information from the officers of the bank. The attempt on the 4th of Augu&s;t, and the robbery on the 1&s;t September, were &s;uppo&s;ed to be committed by the &s;ame per&s;ons. It does not appear evident that Cunningham, the porter, had any concern in the rob|bery. He was found a&s;leep in the bank next morning; nei|ther his conduct nor countenance di&s;covered the lea&s;t &s;ymp|toms of guilt, even to make him &s;u&s;pected. None of the money was found with him, when he died. No evidence but that of Davis, appears to criminate him; and his death prevents his pleading in his own defence. It is not uncom|mon, in criminal ca&s;es, for the innocent to &s;uffer puni&s;h|ment for the guilty: That Mr. Lyon, who fitted the doors

<P>A convict, named Bradley, was the fir&s;t per&s;on attacked in the criminals' jail. He was confined in a cell. At this time, it raged in an alley that runs from Fifth-&s;treet, near to the jail-wall, oppo&s;ite to the cells; from whence it is &s;up|po&s;ed to have reached Bradley, who&s;e window it fronted.&mdash;He was removed on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of September, and died in a few hours after. From him, the di&s;ea&s;e communicated to other pri&s;oners; the number of which, including debtors, amoun|ted to upwards of three hundred. Shortly afterwards, the vagrants, and pri&s;oners confined for petty offences, were re|moved to Morris's-Buildings, and the debtors to Norri&s;|town: The convicts, amounting to about one hundred and &s;ixty, and untried of pri&s;oners, near an hundred, then, only, remained in gaol. Mr. Smith, the Jailor, on the appear|ance of the di&s;ea&s;e, became alarmed. He relinqui&s;hed his charge on the 8th of September, and removed to the country. Robert Wharton, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR>, a vigilant and active magi&s;trate, now mayor of our city, then a&s;&s;umed it. He re&s;ided there, and performed all the duties of jailor, until &s;hortly after the 17th of September, when he was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Mr. Peter Helm; who, afterwards, took upon him&s;elf the charge. The &s;ervices <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rendered by Mr. Helm, during the calamity in 1793, when he pre&s;ided at Ru&s;h-Hill-Ho&s;pital, and in 1797, when he &s;uperintended the City-Ho&s;pital, at the Wigwam, together with his &s;ervices this year, ju&s;tly en|title him to thanks. He was active in the&s;e different capa|cities, and zealou&s;ly and undauntedly run into danger&mdash;but, the palm &s;eems to re&s;t upon other characters: Like the pea|cock in the fable, which other birds wi&s;hed to vie with, &s;ome have been plucking his feathers.</P>
<P>After Mr. Helm took charge of the jail, he re&s;ided there day and night&mdash;watched the convicts, and attended the &s;ick, alternately. Some of the keepers left the jail &s;hortly after
<PB N="94" REF="035335_0093_100231DB27F7B468">
Mr. Smith. Others were taken &s;ick. Their places were &s;upplied by con&s;tables, &amp;c. The &s;ick pri&s;oners were atten|ded by Dr. Benjamin Duffield. He cau&s;ed every humane and &s;alutary mea&s;ure to be adopted for their accommodation. They were removed from the healthy, to a ward in the ea&s;t wing, which was converted into an ho&s;pital. The convale&s;|cents were kept in a &s;eparate apartment. Strict attention was paid to cleanline&s;s, for the better &s;ecurity again&s;t the &s;pread|ing of the di&s;ea&s;e. The green wood was removed from the yard; all rubbage and putrifiable materials, were carried off: The ob&s;tructed water-channel was cleared: The pavement was frequently wa&s;hed, and kept wet and cool, by means of the pump; and the &s;leeping wards, were, as u&s;ual, con&s;tant|ly ventilated. To the&s;e precautions, which were adopted by direction of Mr. Caleb Lownes, with their &s;imple healthy di|et, and the entire prohibition of every kind of liquor, is, per|haps, to be a&s;cribed, the &s;ucce&s;sful e&s;cape of &s;o large a propor|tion of the pri&s;oners. The di&s;ea&s;e &s;pread through every quar|ter of the jail. <HI>'Dutch Hannah',</HI> a convict, was the fir&s;t vic|tim in the we&s;t wing, where the females are kept. Several of the convicts voluntarily offered their &s;ervices as nur&s;es, and attended the &s;ick with tenderne&s;s and attention. One John Brown was the fir&s;t that made this laudable offer.&mdash;He was taken &s;ick, and died. There were, in all, forty-four ca&s;es in the jail; of which, twenty-&s;even paid their la&s;t debt to Nature. Nine were &s;ent to the City-Ho&s;pital; two of which, only, recovered. Thirty-five were attended in jail; twenty of the&s;e &s;urvived.</P>
<P>On the 18th of Augu&s;t, &s;ome of the pri&s;oners in the ea&s;t wing attempted to e&s;cape. Perhaps they were in&s;tigated from a con&s;ideration of the unguarded &s;tate of the ci|ty&mdash;the ab&s;ence of the jailor&mdash;and a wi&s;h to e&s;cape from the fever. They took the advantage of a vi&s;it from the phy&s;ician. They &s;eized upon the key of their apartment&mdash;forced their way out, knocked down Mr. Evans, a con&s;table, then one of the a&s;&s;i&s;tant-keepers, and called to the convicts in the yard to come to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Mr. Wharton, who was in a dif|ferent part of the jail, on hearing the alarm, went immedi|ately to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the keepers. Miller, the ring-leader, had an axe lifted to <HI>di&s;patch</HI> Mr. Evans, which Mr. R. Whar|ton, and Mr. G. Ga&s;s, an a&s;&s;i&s;tant-keeper, ob&s;erving, pre|vented, by well directed balls from their mu&s;kets, which broke the bone of his right arm, and entered his body.&mdash;Mr. Wharton and Mr. Ga&s;s fired at the &s;ame time: the ball from the latter, it was generally &s;uppo&s;ed, proved fatal.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="035335_0094_100231E0C055E448">
Another of the a&s;&s;ailants, of the name of Vaughan, &s;truck Mr. Evans with a bar of iron. He then retreated to his apartment. Evans pur&s;ued him, and lodged a ball in his lungs. He &s;urvived it about twenty-four hours. A Ne|gro convict wounded another by a bayonet. They even|tually drove the gang into their apartments. During the di&s;turbance, the convicts behaved well: They did not even &s;how a wi&s;h to aid the offenders. The bravery and prompt exertions of Mr. Wharton, de&s;erve a high encomium.&mdash;Join|ed by Mr. Evans and Mr. Ga&s;s, the de&s;igns of the&s;e incorri|gible villains were happily fru&s;trated, and the city, in all pro|bability, only thus pre&s;erved from deva&s;tation and pillage.</P>
<P>An un&s;ucce&s;sful attempt was afterwards made by two of the criminals, who were confined in the ea&s;t dungeon.&mdash;They had nearly effected their e&s;cape, by undermining the wall, when fir&s;t di&s;covered.</P>
<P>On the night of the 18th of October, &s;even of the pri&s;oners were &s;ucce&s;sful in making their e&s;cape. They undermined the wall of the ea&s;t wing, and got off; and only two of the banditti were taken.</P>
<P>Several &s;ea-port towns in the United States, be&s;ides Phila|delphia, have been inflicted with the &s;ame calamity this &s;um|mer. It vi&s;ited New-York about the 28th or 30th of July, nearly at the &s;ame period as it did here. The fir&s;t public intimation of its introduction there, was made on the 6th of Augu&s;t. The citizens did not generally leave the town till the end of Augu&s;t, and towards the beginning of Septem|ber. Then the di&s;ea&s;e had made con&s;iderable progre&s;s. The deaths amounted from twenty-three to twenty-five a-day.&mdash;It is e&s;timated, that one third to one-half of the whole inha|bitants left that city. It continued to rage till the 8th or 10th of November. During this period, the deaths amounted to two thou&s;and and eighty-&s;ix. One thou&s;and five hundred and twenty-four, of the&s;e, fell victims to its rage. The enquiries made, to a&s;certain its cau&s;e, have generally been directed to tho&s;e objects which tend to prove its dome&s;tic origin. Hence, perhaps, it is, that this idea is the mo&s;t prevalent there.</P>
<P>Its introduction in Bo&s;ton happened about the fir&s;t of July. On the 4th of Augu&s;t, the &s;electmen had a con|&s;ultation with the phy&s;icians: From who&s;e reports, it appear|ed, that only &s;ixteen per&s;ons had died with that di&s;ea&s;e &s;ince its fir&s;t appearance; and that there were but ten per&s;ons then &s;ick: That in all the ca&s;es, the probability was, that
<PB N="96" REF="035335_0095_100231EEDF2D4AF0">
the infection was taken in or near the Town-dock. That the di&s;ea&s;e did not appear, in any in&s;tance, to be communica|ted from one per&s;on to another; "no phy&s;ician, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, or attendant on the &s;ick, having, at that time, taken the di&s;or|der."</P>
<P>At the &s;ame con&s;ultation, the phy&s;icians gave their opinion, that lob&s;ters and oy&s;ters, at that &s;ea&s;on of the year, and until the middle of September, were extremely pernicious to the health, and predi&s;po&s;ed the body to putrid di&s;orders.</P>
<P>From this time, a regular report of the number of deaths and of the &s;ick was publi&s;hed, by order of the &s;electmen, &s;ign|ed by Wm. Cooper, town-clerk. On the 20th of Augu&s;t, there were twenty &s;ick; on the 31&s;t, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to thirty-two, and continued to increa&s;e until the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">th of September, when there were ninety-&s;even ca&s;es. Afterwards, it gradu|ally abated until tho 6th of October, when it was checked at the approach of fro&s;t, and a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of cold weather.&mdash;On the 18th, the inhabitants were invited to return from exile.</P>
<P>It made its appearance at Port&s;mouth. (N. H.) about the 20th of July, and raged until the beginning of October. Previous to the 20th of Augu&s;t, eleven per&s;ons died, &s;even|teen were &s;ick on the 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">th, five on the 10th of Septem|ber; and but only one ca&s;e appeared on the 5th of October. A committee of health was in&s;tituted; they made their fir&s;t report on the 30th of Augu&s;t. Whether its inhabitants ge|nerally a&s;cribe this &s;courge to importation, or to dome&s;tic origin, cannot be determined by us, nor, perhaps, by them.</P>
<P>A few ca&s;es occurred in Newport, (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">) which excited alarm; but, upon inve&s;tigation, made by the town-council, they traced the cau&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o the &s;hipping, or to per&s;ons who had taken the contagion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> did not generally &s;pread, nor was the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> great.</P>
<P>New-London: in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> was al&s;o partially vi&s;ited. On the 18th of September forty-&s;ix were &s;ick. The great|e&s;t number of new ca&s;es occurred between the 20th and 25th of September. It cea&s;ed about the end of October.</P>
<P>Some ca&s;es appeared in Portland, Maine. It did not there rapidly &s;pread.</P>
<P>Shortly after its commencement in Philadelphia, it extended to the neighbouring towns. At Wilmington, (Delaware,) it raged, at lea&s;t with equal violence, if not &s;uperior, in pro|portion to the number of inhabitants, than it did in our city. They traced its origin to a communication with Philadel|phia. It &s;ub&s;ided nearly at the &s;ame time as here. Two
<PB N="97" REF="035335_0096_1002320070D74BC0">
Hundred and fifty-two died. Fifty died at Che&s;tor, and at Marcus-Hook, fifty-two&mdash;at Chew's Landing, a &s;mall vil|lage in New-Jer&s;ey, ten miles from Philadelphia, twenty-&s;ix died&mdash;and at Cooper's Ferry, oppo&s;ite to the city, about the &s;ame number. There were al&s;o many ca&s;es at Trenton, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">amberton, Frankford, Bri&s;tol, &amp;c. Many fell victims.&mdash;In Germantown and its neighbourhood, fifty-eight <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> occurred, of which thirty-three died; thirty-&s;even of the ca&s;es were actually in Germantown: of tho&s;e, twenty died.</P>
<P>Some went from the city with the di&s;ea&s;e on them; others were out but one day previous to being attacked; but, generally, at about three, and &s;ometimes &s;ix days after. In &s;ome in&s;tances, it was not taken till they had been out ten, twelve, fourteen, and even twenty-one days. The period between receiving it, and its coming into action, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ried in different con&s;titutions. In the full and vigo|rous, it was le&s;s than in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. Intemperance, a dread of it, fatigue or expo&s;ure to the &s;un, facilitated its ac|tion. Its violence was, in &s;ome ca&s;es, as great as in the city, and its termination in death as &s;peedy; but, in general, the ca&s;es were protracted. Some had the black-vomit, and ex|pired in convul&s;ions, and a great number of the &s;ucce&s;sful, as well as un&s;ucce&s;sful ca&s;es, a&s;&s;umed a yellowi&s;h colour.</P>

<P>"Baltimore has happily e&s;caped this year. Their &s;ufferings, in 1797, convinced them of the propriety of an efficient qua|rantine law, and a &s;trict attention to cleanline&s;s. Their care and their &s;ucce&s;s is a good example to other cities. Their mayor enforced a &s;trict compliance with the ordinance for clearing the gutters, and removing every kind of filth, not only from the &s;treets, but from the hou&s;es and lots. He al&s;o &s;olicited the different fire-companies, to have their engines fre|quently exerci&s;ed in watering the &s;treets. This was complied with, as it was deemed nece&s;&s;ary to guard again&s;t its dome&s;|tic generation. On the 10th of Augu&s;t, the Board of Health ordered that all ve&s;&s;els, arriving from any of the We&s;t-India i&s;lands, laden with certain cargoes, which they particularly &s;pecified, &s;hould be prohibited by the health-officer from coming up into port; but, that the cargo thereof &s;hould be di&s;charged into another ve&s;&s;el, while it remained in the river, and that nece&s;&s;ary care &s;hould be ob&s;erved to purify the &s;ame, before it &s;hould be admitted into the city. Communication between Baltimore and the cities of Philadelphia, New-York, Wilmington, &amp;c. was prohibited, under certain re&s;trictions, by proclamations of the mayor, bearing date Augu&s;t 18th, and September 15th."</P>
<P>The governor of South-Carolina i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, di|recting that all ve&s;&s;els which &s;hould arrive at Charle&s;ton, from Philadelphia, or any port or place on the river Delaware, &s;hould be brought to, under the guns of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ort-John&s;on, and perform quarantine.</P>
<P>Many other places in the United States adopted &s;imilar mea&s;ures. In the different ports of Great-Britain, our ve&s;|&s;els were al&s;o obliged to ride quarantine.</P>

<P>"Humanity mu&s;t &s;urely recoil at the circum&s;tance, but the fact is certain, that a poor, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed object of human woe, was forcibly landed, on the morning of Friday la&s;t, from a ve&s;&s;el, at the public wharf at the hay-&s;cales, in the di&s;trict of the Northern-Liberties, at 11 o'clock; and lay expo&s;ed there, without &s;helter, the &s;ame night, and remained under the de|bilitating heat of Saturday, until one o'clock, when the poor &s;ufferer expired, without receiving the friendly aid of huma|nity to &s;upport him in the la&s;t moments of life.

<P>It is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to conceive the mi&s;eries which &s;ome of our unfortunate fellow-mortals were doomed to &s;u&s;|tain. We give the following incidents as a picture, though imperfect:</P>
<P>"About the middle of Augu&s;t, a German, a &s;tranger in the place, applied to be admitted into the Penn&s;ylvania Ho&s;pi|tal. His ca&s;e did not come &s;trictly within their cognizance, and he was refu&s;ed. He then &s;olicited an entrance into the alms-hou&s;e; but having the dy&s;entery, and not being entitled to a place of re&s;idence there, he was un&s;ucce&s;sful. His next application was to the Health-Officer of the port; but he conceiving him&s;elf unauthorized to &s;end him to the City-Ho&s;pital, the poor wretch was turned away, without any hope of relief. What became of him, is not known; but
<PB N="100" REF="035335_0099_1002323284474E70">
the de&s;pondency depicted in his countenance, produced a corre&s;pondent &s;entiment of &s;ympathy in the minds of many, all of whom &s;eemed to regret his unhappy condition, though none knew in what manner to grant him the aid he required."</P>
<P>The body of a man was found in the hou&s;e of captain Ste|vens, which was almo&s;t ate up by vermin. The family ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> left the hou&s;e about a month previous. Three days after which, it was opened to get out &s;ome goods, and &s;hut up again till the end of September; when a captain Skaidmor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> procured the key to take out a che&s;t. As &s;oon as he opened the door, &s;uch an offen&s;ive &s;tench i&s;&s;ued out of it, as indu|ced him, and a b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y who accompanied him, to retreat. They were both, &s;hortly after, taken &s;ick. The body was &s;uffered to remain till evening; when two negroes were hired, for &s;ixteen dollars, to throw the corp&s;e into the river. No trace was left to di&s;tingui&s;h whether it was the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of a white or of a black man, excepting his having long brown hair.&mdash;It is true, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ough very extraordinary, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he family do not know how he got in, nor what &s;oul had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the body. They left no per&s;on, to their knowledge, in the hou&s;e. It was well &s;ecured, and they found it &s;o. He lay under a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ot-bed&s;tead, and had nothing on but a &s;hirt. Even a woman who afterwards clean&s;ed the hou&s;e, took &s;ick and died.&mdash;Hence, a father, a mother, a wife, or perhaps his children, will, daily, hope to find him; but, while this anticipa|tion may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ull their minds from too-deeply grieving at his lo&s;s, no trace remains of him. They do not know that he is gone to "that bou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e from whence no traveller returns."</P>
<P>A man was found dead in a hou&s;e in Front, near Walnut-&s;treet. The corp&s;e was fir&s;t di&s;covered, by an offen&s;ive &s;mell. From the time that elap&s;ed after the family left the hou&s;e, it is thought, it laid there, at lea&s;t, a month. It was in &s;o high a &s;tate of putrefaction, that it was removed by pieces to the coffin in which it was depo&s;ited.</P>
<P>A man was found dead in a fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">l lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> who was &s;een, appa|rently hearty, only three days previous.</P>
<P>A French gentleman was found dead in a hou&s;e in Vine, near Front-&s;treet. The corp&s;e was di&s;covered only by a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> effluvia. No per&s;on lived in the hou&s;e with him.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="035335_0100_1002325047704C00">
A woman was found dead in Water-&s;treet. The corp&s;e laid one day before it was di&s;covered. Her young child was alive upon the &s;ame bed with her.</P>
<P>The corp&s;e of a woman was found on the commons, al&s;o of two men at No. 171, North Second-&s;treet.</P>
<P>The corp&s;e of a man was found in Water-&s;treet. It was carefully laid out, and wrapped in a &s;heet, ready for the coffin.</P>
<P>September 23&mdash;A per&s;on was found dead in Eighth, be|tween Race and Vine-&s;treets. On the 25th, a child was found dead, on the commons, near Potter's-field. On the 27th, the body of a man was di&s;covered on the wharf below Mr. Wharton's counting-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>October 16&mdash;A dead woman was found in a hou&s;e at the corner of Eighth and Shippen-&s;treets.</P>
<P>About the 16th of Augu&s;t, a per&s;on, pa&s;&s;ing through Union, between Second and Third-&s;treets, perceived a nox|ious effluvia, of the nature of that which is emitted by cof|fee, in a &s;tate of putrefaction. He was next day &s;eized with a &s;evere illne&s;s, and died in a few days.</P>
<P>About the 24th of Augu&s;t, a per&s;on went home in a fright, from having &s;een a yellow-looking man. He took &s;ick, and died in eight days.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e of Jane Doron, at the City-Ho&s;pital, is &s;ome|what remarkable: She was, to all appearance, dead. A coffin was brought, and other preparations for her interment pur&s;ued. But &s;ome doubt remained in the mind of Dr. May, the phy&s;ician. He returned&mdash;and, upon examining her bo|dy, he felt a warmth, near the heart, yet without any palpi|tation. Urged by this, he then re&s;olved to try his utmo&s;t ef|forts. He began to rub her arm, in order to bring on a pul&s;e by friction. The &s;teward, who was al&s;o pre&s;ent, laid hold of the other arm, and followed the example. In two hours, &s;he &s;hewed &s;ymptoms of life, fir&s;t, by a quivering at the region of the heart, and a few hours afterwards, by an hy&s;teric fit, which went off with a copious effu&s;ion of tears. She re|covered.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="035335_0101_100232604853D9E8">
Mr. J. Conchy's &s;on died of the calamity. The &s;ame day his daughter went to the river to bring water: She fell in, and was drowned.</P>
<P>A per&s;on entered the hou&s;e of Mr. M'P&mdash;. He men|tioned that he had ju&s;t put a body in a coffin. This alarmed Mrs. M'P&mdash;. She immediately took &s;ick. Di&s;tre&s;s, unu&s;ually accumulated, &s;oon followed. Mrs. M'P&mdash;and a child were attacked. Mrs. M'P&mdash;'s mother and brother went to a&s;&s;i&s;t them. They were likewi&s;e &s;eized; and all died but Mr. and Mrs. M'P&mdash;: nor did di&s;tre&s;s end here:&mdash;Whil&s;t they were in &s;tate of convale&s;cence, they were recommended to move to a more airy, and le&s;s-infected &s;itu|ation. On their removal, they hired a white nur&s;e; having previou&s;ly experienced the negligence of &s;everal black ones. But, &s;he proved to be more abandoned. She let in &s;ome per|&s;ons during the night. Their noi&s;e alarmed Mr. M'P&mdash;, who was but ju&s;t able to walk. He went to inquire what was going on; but, he found them gone, and fire on the floor in &s;everal places. They were robbed of ca&s;h, plate, &amp;c.&mdash;Even the body-clothes of the two patients, who were in bed, were carried off.</P>
<P>In many families the mortality was general. Three bodies have been taken out of <HI>one</HI> hou&s;e at <HI>one</HI> time. Whole fami|lies were, in &s;everal in&s;tances, &s;wept off. Mr. Wiles's wife died on the 26th of September. By the time the hear&s;e came for the corp&s;e, his &s;on was dead; his journeyman died the &s;ame day; next day Mr. Wiles died, and his brother-in-law next day after.</P>
<P>Mr. Scott, a &s;tout, robu&s;t man, in delirium, ran into the &s;treet in his &s;hirt and night-cap; and walked up &s;everal &s;quares, before he was overtaken. A patient made his e&s;cape from the Ho&s;pital with nothing on but his &s;hirt, and went to his lodgings, in Water-&s;treet, (a di&s;tance of two miles); when he arrived, he was covered with blood; It was cau&s;ed by his removing the bandages from the orifice, where he was bled at the Ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>The &s;creams of a woman, who died at No. 32, Carter's-alley, were heard to the di&s;tance of Strawberry-alley, on the one &s;ide, and Dock-&s;treet on the other. The wall of the room was &s;prinkled with blood, that i&s;&s;ued from her mouth, upwards of two feet from where her head lay.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="035335_0102_1001FEB7AB6972F8">
Some were attacked in the &s;treet, others on the commons, and there generally laid till a coach came to carry them to the Ho&s;pital.&mdash;Drunkards, lying in the &s;treet, have al&s;o been &s;ent to the Ho&s;pital, &s;uppo&s;ed to have the fever.</P>
<P>Many &s;cenes occurred to the drivers of the &s;ick coachees, which were calculated to &s;often hearts the mo&s;t hardened! Fathers and mothers delivered to them their &s;ick children, children their parents, wives their hu&s;bands, hu&s;bands their wives, &amp;c. &amp;c. but mo&s;t frequently, ma&s;ters their &s;ervants and landlords their lodgers.</P>
<P>A gentleman who remained in the city during the cala|mity, principally from an intention of a&s;&s;i&s;ting his &s;uffering fellow-creatures, in taking his rounds one morning, met with a man lying in a gutter; who, in his agony, had much brui&s;ed him&s;elf and torn his cloaths. A number of people at a di&s;tance were viewing him; but none ventured to his a&s;|&s;i&s;tance. His own &s;on had de&s;erted him! Shocking to hu|manity! Had it not been for the interference of the above gentleman, he mu&s;t have died, to the reproach of human nature, like a bea&s;t! He was removed to the Ho&s;pital, where the la&s;t moments of this afflicted man were &s;omewhat a&s;&s;uag|ed by the lenient hand of attention. He lived but a few hours after he was removed from the gutter.</P>
<P>A gentleman of New-Jer&s;ey, went to Germantown. When arrived, he felt overcome by heat and fatigue; but, notwith&s;tanding, he tran&s;acted his bu&s;ine&s;s; and immediate|ly &s;et off to return home. On his way in the road, which leads from Frankford to Germantown, perceiving a plea&s;ant place under the &s;hade of a tree, he laid down, with an intention of re&s;ting him&s;elf. Several per&s;ons, who pa&s;&s;ed by, expre&s;&s;ed their pity for his &s;ituation, &s;uppo&s;ing him ill with the fever, but took good care to keep on the other &s;ide of the road. At length, a lady, with her daughter, who happened to be rid|ing by, perceived him, and &s;uppo&s;ing him ill of the fever, ordered her &s;ervant to drive up to the fence. The gentle|man, &s;urprized, rai&s;ed him&s;elf up, and the lady in a &s;ympa|thizing tone of voice, de&s;ired to know if he was unwell. He informed her he was not. But &s;he &s;uppo&s;ing he was unwil|ling to confe&s;s it, pre&s;&s;ed him, that if he had the fever, and no friends near, &s;he would take him to her hou&s;e, which was clo&s;e by, and nur&s;e him her&s;elf. The gentleman, im|pre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="104" REF="035335_0103_10023274A37CD6C0">
with gratitude, aro&s;e, thanked her, and declared that he was only fatigued, and had not been in Philadelphia.</P>
<P>A per&s;on from Philadelphia, travelling in we&s;t New-Jer&s;ey, &s;topped at the hou&s;e of Mr. Craig, a miller, where he was attacked with the fever: he died in a few days. During his ill|ne&s;s, he was nur&s;ed by Mrs. Craig both day and night, who would not let any others go nigh him. She remained with him till he died, and even a&s;&s;i&s;ted to lay him in a coffin.</P>
<P>A woman of Wilmington, after lo&s;ing one of her fami|ly with the fever that raged there, fled with her five children to the hou&s;e of her father, a few miles from Che&s;ter.&mdash;He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a large hou&s;e, farm, &amp;c. On their approach, her father's hou&s;e-keeper came to the gate, and forbid them to enter, at the &s;ame time fa&s;tened it. The fugitives took &s;helter in a &s;chool-hou&s;e, nearly oppo&s;ite, and received daily &s;upport, for near three weeks, from the neighbours generally, the father's family excepted.</P>
<P>During the height of the calamity, it was difficult to pro|cure nur&s;es. The hire was from one to five dollars per day! Richard Allen and William Gray, two men of colour, were very &s;erviceable in a&s;&s;i&s;ting to procure nur&s;es. They recom|mended none but tho&s;e whom they &s;uppo&s;ed could be tru&s;ted.</P>
<P>A young man, of the name of Henry Bullyberger, of Phi|ladelphia, moved to Upper-Providence, Delaware county, about fifteen miles from Philadelphia. Contrary to the in|junctions of his friends, he &s;ecretly vi&s;ited Philadelphia to &s;ee his relations. He went to the Ho&s;pital burying-ground: he there &s;aw &s;eventeen interred. His &s;i&s;ter and her hu&s;band, whom he vi&s;ited, took the fever, with him&s;elf, who all died in the &s;pace of nine days.</P>
<P>Many facts appear, which evidence that the yellow fever is contagious in country places, di&s;tant from tide-water, mar&s;hes, &amp;c. In Germantown, the infection was, in &s;everal ca&s;es, communicated from one to another.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER From a gentleman of experience and re&s;pectability, TO THE EDITORS.</HEAD>
<P>I APPROVE your de&s;ign of publi&s;hing a hi&s;tory of the ma|lignant fever which has ravaged our city, and divers other parts of America. I hope it will be u&s;eful to the citizens of the United States, and profitable to your&s;elves. Such light as may be in my power to throw upon this &s;ubject, you &s;hall have. I propo&s;e, therefore, to an&s;wer your queries accord|ing to the be&s;t of my judgment, in the order you have &s;ta|ted them.</P>
<P>Query I. "Is it" (the di&s;ea&s;e) "of dome&s;tic origin, or imported? If one, or the other, be plea&s;ed to &s;tate the rea|&s;ons for your opinion."</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I believe the di&s;ea&s;e, this year, as in the years '93 and '97, to have been imported; and, I will add, contagious: (this being &s;till doubted by &s;ome, and denied by others). My rea&s;ons are as follow. In the years '93 and '97, the di&s;order broke out near the river, and &s;pread, with remarkable regula|rity, up and down the river; going from hou&s;e to hou&s;e and from &s;treet to &s;treet, until it extended, from the river, quite to the we&s;tward part of the city. In the pre&s;ent year, it appeared in &s;everal parts of the city, di&s;tant from each other, nearly at the &s;ame time: From this circum&s;tance, tho&s;e gentlemen who had entertained a belief that the di&s;|ea&s;e we had in '93 and '97 was of dome&s;tic origin, appear|ed confirmed in their opinion; and concluded that others,
<PB N="ii" REF="035335_0109_100232C2179DCAA8">
mu&s;t now agree with them, that the di&s;ea&s;e, both then and now, originated in this city. If the regular manner in which the di&s;order &s;pread over the city, in the years '93 and '97, fur|ni&s;hed an argument in favour of its being imported and con|tagious, &s;o does the manner in which it appeared among us in the pre&s;ent year, furni&s;h an argument, equally &s;trong, that it was imported and contagious. Its &s;preading over the whole city, in the pre&s;ent year, has been as uniform as it was before; although it appeared in different parts of it nearly at the &s;ame time. Two flat-men, who lodged near the &s;ign of the Cro&s;s-Keys, were among the fir&s;t who died of this di&s;order. Two young men, of the names of Ral&s;ton and Beaty, lodged together near the hay-&s;cales, up town; they had worked on board the &s;hip Deborah; were both &s;eized with the fever, and died. A young man, of the name of I&s;|dell, came from Burlington, went on board the Deborah to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> an acquaintance, was &s;oon after &s;eized with the fever, and died. Doctor Kheimly attended a young man who died with the fever; the Doctor was informed this man belong|ed to the Deborah. A young man, who belonged to the fa|mily of the gentleman who owned the Deborah, died of the fever. It has been repeatedly a&s;&s;erted, that Ely Shoemaker, and '&s;quire Servo&s;s, were on board the Deborah; they died of the fever. A gentleman, who lives at Ken&s;ington, has a&s;|&s;ured me, that they were in health until the Deborah was taken there, to be repaired; that &s;everal of the carpenters, who worked on board her, were &s;eized with the fever and died; and, from them, it &s;pread through the place. Doctor Ben|newell happened to be near this ve&s;&s;el when &s;he was there; he was &s;oon after &s;eized with the fever; it &s;pread through his family, and &s;ome of them died. It is a&s;&s;erted, that a man, of the name of Philips, who lived in Water-&s;treet, between Walnut-&s;treet and the Draw-bridge, went down the river and brought up one, or more &s;ick men, from the Deborah; they died: Philips was &s;eized with the di&s;ea&s;e, and died.&mdash;About the &s;ame time, the di&s;order appeared in the family of the next neighbour of Philips, and &s;oon after, in divers other places in the &s;outh part of the city, all of which could have been traced to the neighbourhood where Philips had died. It now made its appearance up town, about the hay-&s;cales, where Ral&s;ton and Beaty, who had worked on board the Deborah, died; and at the Cro&s;s-Keys, where two &s;hallop|men had died. In con&s;equence of my profe&s;&s;ion, as an apo|thecary, and per&s;ons coming from various parts of the town
<PB N="iii" REF="035335_0110_100232C923C6D810">
for medicine, I had an opportunity of di&s;covering that, al|though the di&s;ea&s;e raged violently in many parts of the city at the &s;ame time, yet there were many other parts en|tirely free from complaint; but, by degrees, the healthy parts dimini&s;hed in magnitude, and the &s;ickly parts increa&s;ed un|til they met; after which, again, and before the di&s;ea&s;e had &s;earched out every part of the town, &s;ome parts, where the di&s;order had raged violently, became free from di&s;ea&s;e; whil&s;t other parts of the town were vi&s;ited that before had been healthy. Near thirty per&s;ons have died in a few hou|&s;es, oppo&s;ite this city, in the Jer&s;eys. The ca&s;e of the ve&s;&s;el, mentioned in the new&s;papers, &s;ailing from this city to City-Point, in Virginia, is a &s;triking proof of the contagion of this di&s;ea&s;e; from this ve&s;&s;el the di&s;order &s;pread, and great numbers of the inhabitants died. About 12 per&s;ons, who came to the annual meeting of the Friends, died. A man came from Wilmington to this city; was in Water-&s;treet, near Philips's; was taken ill &s;oon after he returned home, and died. Some|time after, a quantity of rags, for a paper-maker, was &s;ent from this city to Wilmington; &s;everal young per&s;ons, who handled them, were taken ill and died: from them, &s;ome &s;ay, it &s;pread.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who hold that the di&s;order is of dome&s;tic origin, have &s;aid that many places have been vi&s;ited with as great mortality, in proportion to their numbers, as this city; and who have had no intercour&s;e with any place, &s;o as to have taken the di&s;order by infection; that the fir&s;t who died among them, had never been from home. This has been a&s;&s;erted by &s;ome, and contradicted by others. It would be an arduous ta&s;k to a&s;certain the facts, neither is it material. If this &s;hould even be granted, it does by no means prove what is endeavoured to be inferred from it. If handling a few rags communicated the di&s;ea&s;e, as at Wilmington, and opening a che&s;t of clothes, as was the ca&s;e at Bordentown, might not the di&s;order have been carried, in &s;ome &s;uch way, where it has been &s;uppo&s;ed to have originated, and at the &s;ame time unnoticed? Has it not been frequently carried in bales of goods and clothing, from one country to another? Is it then to be wondered at, that it &s;hould appear in &s;ome places where its communication could not be traced or ac|counted for?</P>
<P>In the year '94, this city, Bo&s;ton and New-London, were clear of the di&s;ea&s;e; and New-York and Baltimore, were af|flicted with it: In the pre&s;ent year, this city, New-York,
<PB N="iv" REF="035335_0111_100232CAB1578BC8">
Bo&s;ton, New-London, and other places, have had it, and Baltimore was healthy. Now, it is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible that an epi|demical di&s;ea&s;e, originating in &s;ome peculiar &s;tate of the at|mo&s;phere, could appear &s;o &s;ingular. What extraordinary phaenomenon has appeared, in the elements, to produce &s;uch a&s;toni&s;hing effects? Had &s;ome deadly exhalation ari&s;en from the bowels of the earth&mdash;or &s;uch a bla&s;t of air, as, at times, appears in &s;ome parts of the world, where men are &s;uddenly &s;mitten with di&s;ea&s;e&mdash;had the heavens a&s;&s;umed an appearance very unu&s;ual, we might, then, have had &s;ome rea&s;on to conclude this di&s;order of dome&s;tic origin; but when the weather has been remarkably &s;erene and plea&s;ant&mdash;when the inhabitants of Philadelphia and Baltimore all breathe the &s;ame common air (unle&s;s, indeed, at Baltimore it is le&s;s &s;alubrious)&mdash;that, at the &s;ame time, a mo&s;t mortal epidemic, as it is called, &s;hould vi&s;it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">s, and they all enjoy good health! This cannot be: The di&s;ea&s;e we have had among us, I believe, has ari&s;en from no &s;uch cau&s;e. It is the opinion of &s;ome gentlemen of the faculty, that coffee and grain, in a &s;tate of putrefaction, will generate a putrid fever; but they do not agree in &s;aying, how far &s;uch a fever is contagious: Some, who admit that they would generate a putrid fever, deny &s;uch a fever would be contagious; others do not admit that a putrid fever would ari&s;e from &s;uch a cau&s;e. If coffee or grain, in a &s;tate of pu|trefaction, will, at any time, generate a contagious putrid fever, it will at all times do &s;o, the &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere being the &s;ame, becau&s;e the operations of nature are uni|formly alike; but, among the farmers and millers in Ame|rica, no in&s;tances of the kind has appeared.</P>
<P>The late doctor Chauvett, who had re&s;ided many years in the We&s;t-Indies, always gave it as his opinion, that the fe|ver, commonly called the We&s;t-India fever, from its pre|vailing there, was not natural to the climate, but was impor|ted from Africa. Doctor Let&s;om, of London, in a letter to a gentleman of the faculty in this city, informs him, that a ve&s;&s;el &s;ailed from Africa in the year '93, and arrived in the We&s;t-Indies, having a malignant fever on board; that this fever &s;pread among the king's troops with great mortality; that one remarkable circum&s;tance attending the di&s;ea&s;e was, that tho&s;e who died &s;eldom &s;urvived the fifth day. It is now further well known, that, from the year '93 to the pre&s;ent time, the fever in the We&s;t-Indies has been wor&s;e than u&s;u|al. A ma&s;ter of a ve&s;&s;el, who has &s;ailed to the We&s;t-Indies for &s;ome years pa&s;t, a&s;&s;ured me, that, in the year '96, he lay
<PB N="v" REF="035335_0112_100232CF96C5B258">
near a Briti&s;h man of war of 74 guns, that the fever appea|red among the crew, and that 30 per&s;ons were buried from her in twenty-four hours. A medical gentleman, with whom I am acquainted, has further informed me, that he was on the coa&s;t of Africa, in the year 1788, when the ve&s;|&s;els that were there, had on board a di&s;ea&s;e re&s;embling the one we have had, in all re&s;pects. We &s;ee, then, in the year '88, this di&s;order was in Africa; doctor Let&s;om has tra|ced it from Africa to Philadelphia, in the year '93; and that it has been in the We&s;t-Indies from '93 to the pre&s;ent year. Is it not then more than probable, that it has been repeat|edly brought from thence to the United States of America?</P>
<P>That this di&s;ea&s;e is the plague, or a plague, is evident, if we attend to the &s;ymptoms and circum&s;tances attending it. In the fir&s;t place, great pro&s;tration of &s;trength attended the &s;ick from the fir&s;t attack; &s;ome died in a few hours after they were taken ill; many died within 24 hours after; but generally on the fifth day. Many were raving and di&s;trac|ted, and would have got away from their nur&s;es if they could. They frequently bled at the mouth and no&s;e, and died with the black vomit. There is a great re&s;emblance, in other re&s;pects, between the di&s;ea&s;e we have had, and tho&s;e plagues which has vi&s;ited other countries.</P>
<P>Under the article of plague, in the Encyclopedia, we are told of a plague that killed &s;carc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> any women, and very few except lu&s;ty men. Another plague, mentioned by Boterus, which a&s;&s;aulted none but the younger &s;ort. Cardon &s;peaks of a plague at Ba&s;il, with which the Switzers were infected, and the Italians, Germans and French, exempted; and a dreadful one at Copenhagen, which, though it raged among the Danes, &s;pared the Germans, Dutch and Engli&s;h, who went with all freedom, and without the lea&s;t danger, to the hou&s;es of the infected. During the plague which ravaged Syria in 1760, it was ob&s;erved, that people of the &s;ounde&s;t con&s;titutions were the mo&s;t liable to it, and that the weak and delicate were either &s;pared, or ea&s;ily cured: it was mo&s;t fatal to the Moors; when it attacked them, it was, generally, incurable.</P>
<P>The di&s;ea&s;e we had in the years '93 and 97 was more mor|tal among men than women; and was &s;till more &s;o among the &s;trong and vigorous than among the weak and delicate; and rarely attacked any under 14 years of age; the We&s;t-Indians e&s;caped it altogether. In the pre&s;ent year, it &s;eems to have &s;eized all ages and both &s;exes, except the We&s;t-In|dians,
<PB N="vi" REF="035335_0113_100232D7756D0080">
and they have e&s;caped it as heretofore; per&s;ons lately from Europe took it readily, and it was generally mortal.</P>
<P>From the foregoing re&s;emblance between the plague, which has de&s;olated other countries, and the &s;ickne&s;s we have had, we may &s;afely pronounce it a plague. If, then, this is its proper appellation, it has not generated in Ameri|ca; no cau&s;e, adequate to the generating &s;uch a di&s;ea&s;e, hav|ing appeared among us. To &s;ay that the elements have un|dergone &s;ome extraordinary change, is merely an a&s;&s;ertion that does not appear to have any foundation. Is there not a great degree of uniformity in the temperature of the air and elements, from Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay to Virginia? and, yet, how different has been the fate of the inhabitants, in particu|lar places, between the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and the other. What &s;alubrity in the air and elements has Baltimore been ble&s;&s;ed with be|yond Philadelphia, New-York, Bo&s;ton, and other places in the pre&s;ent year, and which it was deprived of in the year '94, and Philadelphia enjoyed in preference?</P>
<P>The foregoing are rea&s;ons to induce me to believe the di&s;ea&s;e we have had, was not an epidemical di&s;ea&s;e, occa&s;ioned by any peculiar &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere, nor occa&s;ioned by any &s;tagnated filth in or near, our city. The di&s;order we have had is no le&s;s than a plague; and, as no &s;ufficient cau&s;e has appeared to generate a plague, &s;o, of con&s;equence, it mu&s;t have been imported.</P>
<P>It is generally agreed that the plague was never bred, or propagated, in Britain; but was always imported there: and if it be &s;o, may we not, with as much rea&s;on, conclude it was never bred or generated in America? I do not &s;ay this is impo&s;&s;ible, but only contend it hath never yet happened, although we have had a di&s;ea&s;e, in the la&s;t war, approaching thereto, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the camp fever.</P>
<P>To what cau&s;e, then, &s;hall we attribute the origin of &s;uch a di&s;ea&s;e? Not to a few bags of damaged coffee, or vegetable &s;ub&s;tances, in a &s;tate of putrefaction; this, in my opinion, would not do it. Although per&s;ons approaching &s;uch a &s;ource of polluted air might get a fever, yet I cannot believe &s;uch a fever would be contagious. My &s;u&s;picions are, that this di&s;ea&s;e takes its origin from human nature.</P>
<P>There are frequent plagues among the brute creation, and which are confined to one particular &s;pecies. I &s;u&s;pect, then, that tho&s;e plagues originate in &s;ome peculiar manner among the particular &s;pecies which are afflicted, whether dogs, cats, hor&s;es, or horned cattle. Plagues, therefore,
<PB N="vii" REF="035335_0114_100232DA94D10678">
among men, originate not by means of damaged grain, cof|fee, or any vegetable &s;ub&s;tances, in a &s;tate of putrefaction; but by means of human nature in a &s;tate of peculiar di&s;ea&s;e, death and putrefaction. A number of per&s;ons crouded to|gether, in a narrow apartment, although in perfect health, will &s;oon generate a di&s;ea&s;e; and it will be more malignant the longer they are confined. A large encampment, if pro|vi&s;ions are bad, and the men not kept clean, and impurities not removed, will generate di&s;ea&s;e&mdash;the&s;e are the jail and camp fever, and re&s;emble a plague in &s;ome degree; but to render them &s;o virulent, as to become highly contagious, for they are contagious in &s;ome degree, it may po&s;&s;ibly re|quire that mo&s;t offen&s;ive and deadly exhalation, which ari&s;e from the human corps in a &s;tate of putrefaction; this com|bination of cau&s;es, together with a particular &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere, produces, as I &s;uppo&s;e, what is properly, and di&s;tingui&s;hedly, called the plague. This effluvia operates upon per&s;ons of a peculiar habit of body, as a poi&s;onous lea|ven, &s;o as &s;peedily to reduce them to that &s;tate of di&s;ea&s;e, in which they tran&s;mit the &s;ame pe&s;tilential mia&s;mata, as per|&s;ons in the &s;mall-pox, and &s;ome other di&s;ea&s;es, propagate the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e. I have either read, or heard, of a plague, ari&s;ing from a grave having been opened, when the corps was in a &s;tate of putrefaction; the grave-digger being fir&s;t &s;eized, and dying; from him it &s;pread. That &s;uch a cau&s;e might produce a malignant fever, there is no doubt; how far it would be contagious, depends upon known facts: that the jail and camp fevers are contagious, in &s;ome degree, is true; and that human corps, in a &s;tate of putrefaction, will com|municate a malignant and putrid fever, is al&s;o true; that they may unite together, and, under a peculiar &s;tate of the atmo&s;|phere, con&s;titute a malignant, putrid and contagious fever, is almo&s;t certain; and I very much doubt whether any thing &s;hort of either one or other-of tho&s;e cau&s;es, or the&s;e combined, would produce &s;uch a fever. We are told, that an immen&s;e &s;warm of locu&s;ts dying has occa&s;ioned a plague. I do not doubt the &s;tory; yet I do not believe that this di&s;ea&s;e was conta|gious or catching from man to man; an immen&s;e number of locu&s;ts, in a &s;tate of putrefaction, might contaminate the air, &s;o as to render it almo&s;t fatal for any per&s;on to breathe it. Thou&s;ands might die from &s;uch a cau&s;e; yet this is a different thing from contagion; every man being &s;eized with &s;uch a &s;ickne&s;s, derives his di&s;order immediately from a great ma&s;s of contaminated air; but a contagious, putrid fever is
<PB N="viii" REF="035335_0115_100232E420DE69D8">
where the di&s;ea&s;e communicates an effluvia; which, being received by per&s;ons of a peculiar habit of body, produces, in them, the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e. It is highly probable, as I have before ob&s;erved, that every contagious di&s;ea&s;e with which mankind are afflicted, ari&s;es from &s;ome peculiar cau&s;e among the &s;pecies.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e gentlemen who believe the di&s;ea&s;e we have had was neither imported nor contagious, advance the following rea&s;ons, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that very few of tho&s;e who nur&s;ed in the di&s;|ea&s;e took it; and many others e&s;caped who were much ex|po&s;ed to the contagion, and that it did not &s;pread in the country. It is, indeed, one con&s;oling circum&s;tance attending the di&s;ea&s;e, that there did not appear that danger in nur&s;ing in it, as might have been apprehended from &s;o malignant a di&s;ea&s;e; but it does not therefore follow that it is not, or was not, contagious. It is true, there are &s;ome per&s;ons of that peculiar habit of body which do not take the di&s;ea&s;e, let them be ever &s;o much expo&s;ed to it; were not this the ca&s;e, the world would &s;oon be depopulated.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, that &s;ome of tho&s;e who nur&s;ed at the ho&s;pital, in the mid&s;t of great contagion, enjoyed their health; but leaving the ho&s;pital, and coming into town, they caught the di&s;order. From this, it is inferred, that the di&s;|ea&s;e was not contagious in it&s;elf; but that the danger aro&s;e from the peculiar &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere in the city. Ad|mitting the facts to be as above &s;tated, I account for the nur&s;es e&s;caping the &s;ickne&s;s at the ho&s;pital, and taking it in the city, upon other principles. The ho&s;pital is a building which &s;tands alone, and well aired, and was kept clean; the mia&s;mata, ari&s;ing from the &s;ick, was &s;peedily extingui&s;hed, or carried away by the free admi&s;&s;ion of the air: this, to|gether with the contiguous vegetation, and the &s;alubrious ex|halations ari&s;ing therefrom, rendered it much &s;afer, than where buildings erected, with brick, are crowded together, and the &s;treets paved. By tho&s;e means, the air mu&s;t have been much more di&s;po&s;ed to &s;pread contagion, and to add virulency to the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>I have now an&s;wered your query with re&s;pect to the ori|gin of the di&s;order, and, have further given you &s;ome rea&s;ons why I believe it to be contagious, many others might be ad|vanced.</P>
<P>2dly, You reque&s;t to be informed of "the time when the fir&s;t ca&s;e appeared, and where?"</P>
<P>On the 2d of July, Mark Miller died, as has been re|ported,
<PB N="ix" REF="035335_0116_100232EDD1B01380">
with the u&s;ual &s;ymptoms of the yellow fever. And us this ca&s;e could not be traced to any ve&s;&s;el from the We&s;t-Indies, it has been u&s;ed as an argument in favour of its do|me&s;tic origin: But, it is &s;aid, the bed on which he &s;lept, at his lodgings in Callowhill-&s;treet, was one on which a young man laid, while he had the yellow fever in the year '97. If this be true, as I believe the di&s;ea&s;e to be of the pe&s;tilential kind, it accounts for his having taken the di&s;order, and points out the nece&s;&s;ity of well clean&s;ing hou&s;es. There were di|vers other per&s;ons who died in the month of June and July, (who&s;e names I have forgot) with &s;ymptoms, as it was &s;aid, very much re&s;embling the yellow fever; and tho&s;e gentle|men who hold that the fever originated among us, advance the&s;e ca&s;es as additional arguments in favour of their hypo|the&s;is: But, might they not have died in con&s;equence of contagion remaining, either in beds or cloathing from the preceding year, or from &s;ome ve&s;&s;els from the We&s;t Indies? for, the di&s;ea&s;e is there, and no doubt has been brought by other ve&s;&s;els be&s;ides the Deborah and Mary; or might not tho&s;e per&s;ons have died of a billious fever, &s;uch as that which &s;ometimes prevails in the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on, which is not con|tagious, yet, in its &s;ymptoms, is very much like the malig|nant fever we have had among us? It may be &s;aid, that if tho&s;e per&s;ons had received the di&s;order either by a ve&s;&s;el from the We&s;t-Indies, from pe&s;tilential mia&s;mata, remaining in beds or cloathing, the di&s;order would have &s;pread from them over the city. This does not follow, neither. There is no doubt but that a certain pre-di&s;po&s;ition, in the air, is ne|ce&s;&s;ary, in order for it to &s;pread, and a pre-di&s;po&s;ition of body al&s;o to receive it. A warm &s;ummer produces this effect: it both renders the atmo&s;phere di&s;po&s;ed to &s;pread the di&s;ea&s;e, and the habits of bodies among the people to receive it, and al&s;o it may require the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on to produce this effect, &s;o as for it to &s;pread generally, yet &s;ome individuals may take it earlier. This &s;entiment &s;eems corroborated from a great number having had the di&s;order &s;ince it has generally aba|ted; for, as &s;ome have taken the di&s;order &s;ince the weather has been &s;o favourable as to have very much extingui&s;hed it, &s;o &s;ome might have taken it from previous contagion, be|fore the &s;ea&s;on was &s;uch as to promote a general infection.</P>
<P>Your third query is, "What were the general appear|ances of the di&s;ea&s;e? Were they any way different from the year '93." An&s;wer. The general appearances of the di&s;ea&s;e
<PB N="x" REF="035335_0117_100232EFA4A2A598">
&s;o nearly re&s;embled the appearances in the year '93, as evi|dently &s;hewed it to be the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e, yet more malignant and mortal. In the year '93, &s;carce any took the di&s;order under 14 or 15 years of age: it was le&s;s mortal among wo|men than men. In the pre&s;ent year, it has been very mortal among all ages, and both &s;exes.</P>
<P>4th. You query, "What were the &s;ucce&s;sful modes of treatment? did they differ from former practice?"</P>
<P>An&s;wer. The mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful mode of treating this di&s;or|der, appeared to be, either by &s;alivating the patient as &s;pee|dily as po&s;&s;ible, or by promoting a copious &s;weat, on the fir&s;t &s;ymptoms appearing; then to open the body well, and by keeping it open with moderate purges, and frequent cly&s;tering. Altho' the lancet was not &s;o frequently u&s;ed as heretofore, yet, in &s;ome ca&s;es, it was, in my opinion, very proper. The regimen &s;hould be of the cooling kind; &s;uch as that generally known and practi&s;ed in malignant fevers. If the patient &s;hould be &s;eized with a pain in the &s;tomach, which is &s;ometimes the ca&s;e, and it is an unfavourable &s;ymptom, I have known extraordinary good effects produced by fomenting the part with a decoction of flax&s;eed. There is no di&s;ea&s;e which depends more upon the nur&s;e; for, if your phy&s;ician is ever &s;o &s;kilful, if your nur&s;e is inatten|tive, you may, neverthele&s;s, lo&s;e your friend; and, it is on this account, that this di&s;ea&s;e has been more mortal than otherwi&s;e it would have been. I have been informed by a young man, who nur&s;ed in the di&s;order, at Wilmington, that the mortality was con&s;iderably le&s;s among tho&s;e who were laid under tents, and upon the ground, with only &s;traw under them, than among tho&s;e who were attended in the u&s;ual way in dwelling hou&s;es.</P>
<P>5th. You query, "Was the di&s;ea&s;e in any ca&s;es infec|tious, when carried into the country, di&s;tant from tide-wa|ter?"</P>
<P>An&s;wer. This di&s;ea&s;e was infectious at Germantown: eight or ten per&s;ons took it in two or three families. This di&s;order will be mo&s;t mortal in cities that are large, and po|pulous, (whether they are on tide-water or not,) on account of hou&s;es depriving each other of a free admi&s;&s;ion and cir|culation of the air, the encrea&s;ed heat of cities, and their being deprived of the &s;alubrity of vegetation, and the occu|pation of many citizens confining them within doors.</P>
<P>6th. You a&s;k, "What e&s;timate do you make of the num|ber
<PB N="xi" REF="035335_0118_100232F50B625268">
who have died in the country? How long were they out? Or whether, with them, it a&s;&s;umed &s;uch fatal or vio|lent appearances as here?"</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I have taken no pains to a&s;certain the numbers who have died in the country; but they are much greater than the numbers were in the year '93; neither have I taken any pains to a&s;certain what length of time they were out. With re&s;pect to tho&s;e who were &s;eized with the di&s;order in the country, it appeared to be as fatal as in the city, although it did not &s;pread as it did in the city: the rea&s;on for which, I conceive to be, country hou&s;es are better aired, and the advantages they have of the &s;alubrious effects of vegetation.</P>
<P>7thly. "What are the be&s;t means of preventing its intro|duction or generation, or to prevent its attack, when gene|rated, be&s;ides that of flight?"</P>
<P>An&s;wer. As this di&s;order is unque&s;tionably imported from the We&s;t-Indies, the be&s;t means of preventing its introduc|tion is, to &s;top all trade there for a few months in the year; or to oblige ve&s;&s;els to perform a more effectual quarantine than has been ob&s;erved heretofore. The be&s;t way to pre|vent an attack of the di&s;ea&s;e, when introduced among us, be&s;ides that of flight, is, to keep your per&s;on and your habi|tation &s;weet and clean, u&s;e moderate exerci&s;e in the open air, not to &s;tand &s;till in the &s;un, and avoid taking cold; to live temperately, yet by no means too ab&s;temiou&s;ly, nor to take purgatives by way of prevention; and, above all things, to acquire, if po&s;&s;ible, a magnanimous mind that does not fear death. I know of no better preventatives than the fore|going; yet, as the di&s;ea&s;e is the plague, I believe many would take it, if expo&s;ed to the contagion, let them u&s;e whatever precaution they may.</P>
<P>8thly. "What are the be&s;t means of clean&s;ing hou&s;es, clothes, &amp;c. of the infected, and of de&s;troying contagion?".</P>
<P>An&s;wer. Gunpowder &s;la&s;hed in an infected room will ex|pel the foul air, and replace it with air free from conta|gion; but, that every clo&s;et and crevice may be &s;earched, &s;hut your room clo&s;e up, &s;top the fire-place, &s;et a pan of coals in the middle of the room, on which throw a quantity of brim&s;tone, and fill your room with the fumes; or, take a handful of common &s;alt, or &s;alt-petre, and with it, about half a pound of oil of vitriol, hanging, at the &s;ame time, wear|ing apparel, or any other article which you may apprehend is infected, in the room. The&s;e fumes will penetrate every thing thoroughly, and clean&s;e them from infection. Linens
<PB N="xii" REF="035335_0119_100232FC1686A9A0">
may be clean&s;ed by &s;teeping them in ley, and woolens in &s;oap &s;uds. White-wa&s;h your walls with lime, and wa&s;h your floors with ley. To bury an infected article in the ground ten days will clean&s;e it.</P>
<P>9thly. "Are there any particular cla&s;&s;es of per&s;ons more &s;ubject to it than others."</P>
<P>An&s;wer. It appears that &s;ome per&s;ons are more liable to take it than others. In this re&s;pect, it corre&s;ponds with &s;ome other plagues which have appeared at different times. I know of no in&s;tance of a We&s;t-Indian taking the di&s;order, although there was many in the city during the whole &s;ick|ne&s;s. Europeans have taken it very readily, and it has been generally mortal among them. Of the Americans in the year '93, I know of but few who took it under 14 or 15 years of age, and as I have ob&s;erved before, it was more mortal among men than women; and it has been more mortal then and the pre&s;ent year, among the robu&s;t and &s;anguinary, than among per&s;ons of a &s;pare habit of body. Of hard drinkers, &s;carce one in twenty have recovered.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE received your circular letter of the 9th of No|vember, containing queries relative to the epidemic, which lately ravaged our city and other places on this continent. The good that may re&s;ult from your undertaking is obvious, if it only contributes to propagate tho&s;e opinions which will lead us to efficacious mea&s;ures for the pre&s;ervation of a great population. Many old countries have protected them|&s;elves again&s;t plagues and malignant fevers, and why &s;hould we not imitate their improvements to obtain the &s;ame ble&s;&s;|ings? I have now but little to &s;ay on the various topics of &s;o intere&s;ting a &s;ubject, yet, I think it is the duty of every in|dividual,
<PB N="xiii" REF="035335_0120_100232FDA3D1E818">
to &s;ubmit to the public any ob&s;ervation that he may deem conducive to relieve us from one of the greate&s;t cala|mities. That duty I endeavoured to fulfil la&s;t year, and I would be obliged to repeat what I have already publi&s;hed, if I were to an&s;wer all your queries. I &s;hall, however, content my&s;elf with a few ob&s;ervations that have occurred during one year more of experience.</P>
<P>"<HI>Is the yellow fever of dome&s;tic origin?</HI>" Men wi&s;hing for &s;pe|culative demon&s;tration, might perhaps be &s;atisfied with what has been already &s;aid in the affirmative of this que&s;tion, and chiefly by the opinion of the majority of the learned in the United States; but, if a proof of another kind is acceptable&mdash;a proof of fact and of experimental demon&s;tration, &s;uch a proof has been offered to me by a &s;ingular circum&s;tance; and I beg your readers will weigh it with impartiality, while their candour will require no further evidence than that which is in the power of one witne&s;s to give.</P>
<P>A gentleman from a foreign country, who arrived during our late epidemic, informed me, that although he was quite healthy, and had lived many years in one of the We&s;t-In|dia i&s;lands, he did experience a di&s;agreeable impre&s;&s;ion from our atmo&s;phere chiefly during the fir&s;t days of his ar|rival; and that he had even felt &s;ome fever, which ju&s;t|ly alarmed him. In con&s;equence, he fixed his re&s;idence at two miles di&s;tant from town, where he never &s;uffered any kind of indi&s;po&s;ition; yet, as he frequently came into the city, he then always di&s;covered that our atmo&s;phere was impregnat|ed with corrupted effluvia, which he could a&s;&s;imilate to no|thing better than to the effluvia from rotten wood. This ef|fect was very &s;urpri&s;ing to him; for he admired the regula|rity and the cleanline&s;s of this town in general. I an&s;wered, that if I could add to his ob&s;ervation a greater evidence than that of a &s;ingle individual, I could derive from it a convinc|ing proof, that the origin of our epidemic was a contagion abundantly floating in our atmo&s;phere, and ince&s;&s;antly re|newed in it. It was obvious to &s;uppo&s;e that this gentleman was endowed with a particular degree of acutene&s;s in his olfactory organs, which power, however, is not very uncom|mon, and which many among us do not perceive, being ac|cu&s;tomed to live in a vitiated atmo&s;phere. But how could an imported di&s;order produce &s;uch an alteration in it? Are not populous towns in Europe productive of much more corrupt|ed vapours, than tho&s;e that can ari&s;e from a few patients &s;cattered about? and yet none of them, except in the Le|vant,
<PB N="xiv" REF="035335_0121_10023301C98ABFC0">
are productive of pe&s;tilence. Moreover, all the hou&s;es here, few excepted, were &s;hut up during the la&s;t prevalence, and almo&s;t none could produce the u&s;ual &s;hare of corruption which mu&s;t continually ari&s;e from inhabited places. It re&s;ted with me to collect as much evidence as I could of an important fact, becau&s;e the a&s;&s;ertion of the above gentleman extended to all the minutes which he pa&s;&s;ed in town, and at every time of his coming into it from the hou&s;e where he lodged in the country. It was con&s;equently agreed between us that he would &s;ubmit to a trial, by which I could render both his unprejudiced veracity, and the acutene&s;s of his &s;melling pow|er, unque&s;tionable proofs of an exi&s;ting contagion in our at|mo&s;phere. I then de&s;ired him to come with me, while I vi&s;ited my patients. If I &s;topped at any place or hou&s;e where there was no &s;ick, I would leave to him to di&s;criminate whether effluvia or corrupted mia&s;ma could be &s;melled in the neighbourhood or in the entries around. This ob&s;ervation was very difficult to make; but I thought it could not be im|po&s;&s;ible to a man who could di&s;tingui&s;h &s;uch alterations in the atmo&s;phere: it was be&s;ides grounded on the opinion and the fact of noxious vapours &s;en&s;ibly ari&s;ing from the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ds or bodies of patients in the yellow fever, and po&s;&s;ibly diffu&s;ing at a great di&s;tance. The man accepted the ta&s;k, and fulfilled it wonderfully well. At every place where I &s;topped or went in, he was able to tell whether a patient was in it or not: he could al&s;o di&s;cover when I had put my&s;elf too much in contact with the &s;ick. But I objected that the contagi|ous mia&s;ma, which he perceived &s;o &s;trongly in the neigh|bourhood and in the hou&s;es of the &s;ick, might be &s;uppo&s;ed to be the cau&s;e of the corrupted vapours, which he had ob|&s;erved in the atmo&s;phere. He could not think &s;o, he &s;aid, becau&s;e they were quite different, and he was now &s;melling a new &s;ort of human or animal putrefaction which he had not yet in any degree &s;melled in the general currents of the air, within the avenues and the &s;treets of the city. For a la&s;t trial, I took with me a clean white pocket handkerchief, and left it a few minutes in the bed of a patient. I wrapped it up again in a &s;heet of paper. At the fir&s;t interview with the gentleman, I &s;uddenly unfolded it, and &s;hook it in his pre&s;ence, and pretty near him, when he &s;uddenly complain|ed of my diffu&s;ing very &s;trong and corrupted vapours, &s;uch as he had &s;melled before at my patients' hou&s;es. I finally remained &s;atisfied of the extreme acutene&s;s of the &s;en&s;es of the ob&s;erver, and of his veracity in a&s;certaining that our
<PB N="xv" REF="035335_0122_100233041C7B3AB0">
atmo&s;phere was contaminated with corrupted vapours. That the air is con&s;tantly renewed and purified of any kind of im|pure emanations, even without wind, is a fact that experi|ence teaches us, in every populous town, and at any &s;ea&s;on of the year; but, &s;uch effects cannot take place, when the local &s;ources of corruption, as the wharves, &amp;c. are in a con|tinual fermentation. This was doubtle&s;s the ca&s;e of Phila|delphia. Then, it is not &s;urpri&s;ing, that our atmo&s;phere &s;hould bread fevers, contagion and death!</P>
<P>To unprejudiced people, it will appear impo&s;&s;ible that an imported di&s;order could contaminate the whole atmo&s;phere during three months, and when &s;o few people remain in it.</P>
<P>The other point to which I may advert, in an&s;wer to your letter, is the proportion of tho&s;e who recovered by the be|nefit of medical art, and by the method of treatment which has been generally employed by the greate&s;t number of our phy&s;icians. In giving &s;uch e&s;timate, however, I wholly co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|fine it within my own opinion, and tho&s;e of a few medical friends. Owing to the greater degree of malignancy of the la&s;t epidemic, it &s;hould &s;eem that the &s;ucce&s;s of our prac|tice has not &s;urpa&s;&s;ed that of the year '97, although the be&s;t remedies were more generally employed. It is true, that it is the peculiar character of a contagious di&s;order to increa&s;e its deplorable effects in proportion to the degree of alarm that it &s;preads; for, patients altogether given up to the mo&s;t &s;hock|ing de&s;pair, and de&s;titute of proper a&s;&s;i&s;tance, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;a|rily &s;oon become victims of the &s;ickne&s;s. The&s;e con&s;idera|tions, oblige us, gentlemen, to limit our reckoning among or from the patients who were timely and properly a&s;&s;i&s;ted; and of tho&s;e, I think, that &s;ix recovered out of &s;even. If it was made known that this ju&s;t and true proportion of the &s;ick reco|vered by more re&s;pectable authorities than that of an indivi|dual, in&s;tead of &s;o many dreadful accounts of deaths ince&s;&s;antly publi&s;hed, certainly the people at large would at lea&s;t be &s;up|ported by a con&s;oling and relieving hope, and in fact, they would be more careful of them&s;elves; for, tho&s;e who cannot conveniently remove from the &s;eat of the infection, would be more attentive in procuring medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance, for which they apply too late or not at all, for want of confidence in its remedies, and becau&s;e they are not at all appri&s;ed of their effectual applications. I &s;hall al&s;o take the liberty to &s;ugge&s;t, that the public authority might ea&s;ily obviate the di&s;advantage of the ab&s;ence of many of our regular phy&s;icians, by granting to tho&s;e who choo&s;e to remain in the infected places, the
<PB N="xvi" REF="035335_0123_1002330A8569CDA0">
means of attending as many patients as they could, if they are not u&s;ed to keep the accommodation of a carriage.</P>
<P>One objection may be made again&s;t the above proportion of the patients recovered under the help of medical art, if we attend, without explanation, to a comparative &s;tatement on that &s;ubject, publi&s;hed by the health office, the 21&s;t of Sep|tember. So it &s;tood;

</ROW>
</TABLE></P>
<P>The health office was &s;olicitou&s;ly impelled to publi&s;h <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> above &s;tatement, in order to convince the people, that there was a great danger for them to &s;tay in town, and that the a&s;&s;i&s;tance prepared for them in the city-ho&s;pital was far bet|ter than any they could procure in the city: in all re&s;pects that intention was laudable; and, in many, the con&s;equences were true; but it behoves a phy&s;ician to explain, why &s;uch a great number as the half of the &s;ick died in the ho&s;pital, and why three-fourths have fallen victims in town.</P>
<P>I never granted to a &s;ick per&s;on an order for admi&s;&s;ion in|to the city-ho&s;pital, but I lamented that it was too late, be|cau&s;e one or two days had been lo&s;t, by the patient indulging him&s;elf in the opinion, that his ca&s;e was not the yellow fe|ver, or trying &s;ome remedies recommended by their neigh|bours; or fooli&s;hly delaying to take a re&s;olution, which igno|rance and prejudice rendered very painful to every one of them. To that delay, one or two days were added before the patient would be admitted into the ho&s;pital, owing to ne|glect in tran&s;mitting the order to the officers of the board of health, or to the want of &s;ome body who could be &s;ent for the carriage, or to accidental delays of other kinds. Thus, it may be ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, to the honour of the phy&s;i|cians employed in the city-ho&s;pital, that mo&s;t of the patients they received were taken &s;ick three or four, and many four or five days previous to their admi&s;&s;ion; yet, at that time, they had cured half of them.</P>
<P>We were in town witne&s;&s;es to almo&s;t the &s;ame neglects, delays, and prejudices, among the &s;ick who called for bur a&s;|&s;i&s;tance. Many refu&s;ed to be &s;ent to the ho&s;pital, who died de&s;titute of nur&s;es and the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary remedies; while they &s;urely were not benefited by our atmo&s;phere. They
<PB N="xvii" REF="035335_0124_1002331187FC01A0">
were al&s;o injured by the heat, narrowne&s;s and uncleanline&s;s of their hou&s;es and clothes. As the yellow fever has often the &s;urpri&s;ing effect of &s;u&s;pending any kind of painful &s;en&s;a|tion, many felt as if nothing of con&s;equence ailed them, till the approach of death. If, on the contrary, they were attacked with violent &s;ymptoms, they were abandoned even by their neare&s;t relations; but few charitable and judicious nur&s;es could be found; of the remaining phy&s;icians, many were &s;ick and con|fined. In &s;hort, I have &s;een about &s;ixty or &s;eventy patients, all of the above de&s;cription; the greate&s;t part died; and it &s;urely will be granted, that if they had received proper a&s;&s;i&s;tance, the greater part mu&s;t have recovered; and, for the truth and ju&s;tne&s;s of the&s;e ob&s;ervations, I can, I believe, with confidence, call upon the candor and experience of the other phy&s;icians. It will then be under&s;tood, why &s;o many patients died in town with the yellow fever, without derogating from the e&s;timate I have given of tho&s;e who recovered under medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Every body is now inve&s;tigating what are the be&s;t means of preventing the return of that calamity. We mu&s;t congra|tulate our&s;elves on the laudable and numerous exertions of our fellow citizens. The introduction of pure waters, will, no doubt, prove one of the mo&s;t beneficial improvements; for, it equally an&s;wers the purpo&s;e of clean&s;ing the &s;treets, as refre&s;hing the atmo&s;phere. The poor people al&s;o will have an ea&s;ier and more convenient means for wa&s;hing their clothes, which they are u&s;ed to keep dirty, during the &s;ummer, until they can gather &s;ome rain water; but that is not all: many other cau&s;es did appear to me very obnoxious to the whole&s;om|ne&s;s of the town. The ca&s;ements and logs of our wharves are old, and their &s;urface is rotten; at low water, when a &s;corching &s;un dries them up, they produce very infecting and dangerous effluvia. The vicinity of the docks has always appeared to be the &s;eat of many deaths; becau&s;e, at the periodical return of the tide, their filthy waters are al&s;o returned, and the mo&s;t corrupt|ed and black mud is left again on the bottom. Too many crow|ded buildings are unfortunately erected upon the wharves. The whole ea&s;t &s;ide of Philadelphia is walled by a double, thick and high range of hou&s;es, through which the air has but few &s;treets opened to circulate. The conveniencies of the &s;hipping and mercantile bu&s;ine&s;s, have thus deprived the metropolis of the refre&s;hing and moi&s;t currents of air, that mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily ri&s;e from one of the large&s;t rivers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There are about ten thou&s;and hou&s;es in Philadelphia; the ground al&s;o contains ten thou&s;and deep ditches <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> privy nece&s;&s;a|ries: many of them contain the animal filth of &s;everal genera|tions, and, for the cleaning of them, no law was enacted; no means were provided!

&s;treets of the &s;uburbs, and many of the city, are left in a &s;urpri&s;ing &s;tate of degradation, and without pavement, while the numerous carriages and great intercour&s;e with the coun|try, render them &s;till wor&s;e; no declivity is given to their waters; no police law is enacted to compel the inhabitants to clean their foot-ways. There the rains, and the common &s;ewers of hou&s;es, empty, form ponds, and cover the &s;urface with a thick &s;tratum of animal and vegetable putrefaction. There is nobody in tho&s;e parts, and even South &s;treet, who could not, when he plea&s;es, manure his little garden with the black mud which &s;urrounds them. I never could think, gen|tlemen, as many do, that the numerous burying-grounds in|clo&s;ed in the city, were of no bad con&s;equence. I believe quite the rever&s;e, and I &s;upported it in my account of the yellow fever in '97, by rea&s;ons and arguments which I do not think ea&s;y to refute. All tho&s;e burying-grounds are &s;ituated on the mo&s;t elevated points of the city; and as the highe&s;t part of the city is forty feet above the river, and as the ditches are dug only &s;ix feet deep, I calculate that the bed of all our dead, lie between 20 and 30 feet above the lowe&s;t ground. How many &s;treets, con&s;equently, and how many cellars are lower than the lowe&s;t bottom of a burying-ground? I a&s;k now, whether the con&s;tant moi&s;ture and vapour of the ground can be infiltrated from any where but from the high &s;ur|rounding parts, and whether waters wa&s;hing thou&s;ands of dead bodies, renewed every year, do not retain the mo&s;t noxious particles, although the&s;e waters, under the whole ground of Philadelphia, do circulate through the mo&s;t ho|mogeneous clay.</P>
<P>The&s;e are, gentlemen, the points of ob&s;ervation which have con&s;tantly fixed my opinion, on the origin of our ma|lignant fever; from which nothing now can pre&s;erve us, ex|cept a cool &s;ummer, and frequent N. W. winds. Other re|medies or preventatives again&s;t &s;uch a calamity, will, I hope, be found in the liberality and experience of our enlightened fellow-citizens; but it would be u&s;ele&s;s to &s;tre&s;s upon any other conjecture or hypothe&s;is. It was always known, and never ob|jected but here, that the vicinity of effluvia from corrupted

animal or vegetable &s;ub&s;tances were pe&s;tilential, and produc|ed fatal di&s;ea&s;es; and whenever &s;uch &s;ources of contagion &s;urround us, and exi&s;t with us, it would be injudicious to dwell upon mere &s;uppo&s;itions; for the importion of a fever will always be a &s;uppo&s;ed doctrine, &s;ince it is generally grant|ed, that during the heat of &s;ummer, the &s;ame cau&s;es can pro|duce it on board of ve&s;&s;els, at &s;ea or in our ports, and often car|ries off the whole of their crews. It is al&s;o very extraordina|ry, that we &s;hould receive, by importation, a di&s;order which proves &s;o terrible among us, while it is but occa&s;ionally in the countries from where we dread to receive it, and where it is hardly thought contagious, and never threatens, to an alarming degree the population nor the pro&s;perity of the inhabitants.</P>

<HEAD>Letter to Thomas Mifflin, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR>. Governor of the Commonwealth of Penn&s;ylvania, From the Academy of Medicine of Philadelphia, on the origin and means of preventing the return of the Yellow Fever.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN order to comply with your reque&s;t to the Academy of Medicine, communicated by Dr. Samuel Duffield, con|&s;ulting Phy&s;ician of the port, re&s;pecting the means of prevent|ing the return of the epidemic fever, which has lately afflict|ed our city, the Academy have conceived the hi&s;tory of its origin, nece&s;&s;arily connected with their an&s;wer.</P>
<P>We believe it was derived from the following &s;ources:</P>
<P N="1">1. The exhalations of the alleys, gutters, docks, and com|mon &s;ewers of the city; and from &s;tagnating water in its neighbourhood.</P>
<P N="2">2. The foul air di&s;charged with the balla&s;t of the &s;hip De|borah, and the cargo of the brig Mary; the former of which arrived from Hi&s;paniola on the 18th July, and the latter on the 29th of the &s;ame month. We reject the opinion of an imported human contagion in either of the above ve&s;&s;els. It has not been a&s;&s;erted that any per&s;on died of the yellow fe|ver on board the Mary, during her voyage: and if it be &s;aid,
<PB N="xx" REF="035335_0127_1002332059279728">
that &s;everal per&s;ons died on board the Deborah of that di&s;ea&s;e, on her pa&s;&s;age to this city, we cannot admit that they contami|nated the timbers or contents of the &s;hip in &s;uch a manner, as to &s;pread the di&s;ea&s;e to per&s;ons at &s;everal hundred feet di&s;|tance from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he wharf at which &s;he was moored. The impro|bability of this opinion will appear from two con&s;iderations.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t&mdash;The di&s;ea&s;e is not contagious in the We&s;t-Indies; and rarely, if ever &s;o, in the United States in hot weather, at which time only it makes its fir&s;t appearance in our country. So general is this opinion, that &s;ome phy&s;icians have unfor|tunately refu&s;ed to admit the exi&s;tence of the fever in its com|mencement in our city, only becau&s;e it was not contagious.</P>
<P>Second&mdash;The di&s;ea&s;e was in no in&s;tance propagated by tho&s;e per&s;ons who were &s;uppo&s;ed to have derived it from hu|man contagion adhering to the timbers o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> contents of the Deborah and Mary, and who died with it in parts of the city remote from the influence of the foul air of tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>If it be &s;aid that the contagion of the yellow fever is not uniform in its effects, it ought at lea&s;t to be admitted, that it acts with mo&s;t certainty where it exi&s;ts with mo&s;t force; but the rever&s;e of this took place in the &s;uppo&s;ed origin of our late fever from imported contagion. We are the more deter|mined in our opinion of the foul air of the Deborah and Mary being the cau&s;e of many ca&s;es of our fever, from &s;imi|lar ca&s;es of fever having been often produced from &s;imilar cau&s;es, in&s;tances of which were mentioned in our letter to you of la&s;t year.</P>
<P>In &s;upport of our opinion of the di&s;ea&s;e being derived from the exhalations of our city before enumerated, we &s;hall men|tion the names of the following per&s;ons, who had the fever before the arrival of the Deborah or Mary, in our port, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Benjamin Jones, Fromberger's Court, June 2d; Mary Wrig|gle&s;worth, near the corner of Walnut and Tenth-&s;treets, June 6th; Rebecca Tre&s;ted, in Front between Spruce and Union-&s;treets, June 11th; Elizabeth Curran, Fourth below South-&s;treet, June 27th; Mark Miller, Callowhill-&s;treet, and Molly Zeller, Race-&s;treet, July 2d; Mi&s;s Byrne, Spruce between Second and Third &s;treets, July 11th; Mr. Vanno&s;t, Shannon-&s;treet wharves, July 12th. We ob&s;erved, moreover, and heard of a con&s;iderable number of per&s;ons who had the di&s;ea&s;e in the we&s;tern parts of the city, and in Southwark and the Northern Liberties, who had not been expo&s;ed to con|tagion, nor breathed the air in the neighbourhood of Water-&s;treet
<PB N="xxi" REF="035335_0128_10023323C99C7AD0">
for many weeks, and in &s;ome in&s;tances for &s;everal months, before they were attacked by that fever.</P>
<P>In addition to the arguments in favour of the dome&s;tic &s;ources of the fever, that had been mentioned in our former letter, we &s;hall add four more, that we think cannot be re|futed.</P>
<P N="1">1. The atmo&s;phere of our city, during the prevalence of the fever, produced &s;en&s;ations of pain or &s;ickne&s;s in many people who came into it from the country; the &s;ame atmo&s;|phere became the cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e and death in others who vi&s;ited the city, and who carefully avoided lodging, or any intercour&s;e with per&s;ons infected by the fever.</P>
<P N="2">2. The di&s;ea&s;e prevailed in many inland towns of the Unit|ed States, which had no intercour&s;e with tho&s;e &s;ea-port towns in which it was epidemic. Tho&s;e towns were, in every in|&s;tance we have heard of, &s;ituated near to putrid &s;ub&s;tances, or &s;tagnating water.</P>
<P N="3">3. The di&s;ea&s;e was rarely contagious, even when it termi|nated in death, when carried into the country, or into towns not expo&s;ed to putrid exhalations.</P>
<P N="4">4. The general extinction of the di&s;ea&s;e by fro&s;t, clearly proves that it exi&s;ts chiefly in the atmo&s;phere; and that it is not derived, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, from human contagion; for fro&s;t, it is well known, does not act in the autumnal months upon the bodies of the &s;ick, nor upon their beds, clothing, or any other &s;uppo&s;ed receptacle of contagion.</P>
<P>We wi&s;h to direct the attention of our fellow-citizens to the hi&s;tory of the cau&s;es and remedies of pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es in foreign countries: In the ages of medical &s;uper&s;tition, when tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es were believed to be imported, they nearly de|populated cities for many &s;ucce&s;&s;ive years. Frequent and ac|cumulated &s;uffering at la&s;t begat wi&s;dom. The cau&s;es of pe&s;tilence were di&s;covered to exi&s;t in all countries, and do|me&s;tic remedies were applied to remove them. The effect of this change in the opinion and conduct of the nations of Europe has been the almo&s;t general extirpation of malignant fevers from their cities and &s;ea ports. We have many docu|ments to prove that the recurrence of the yellow fever has been prevented in the cities of Europe by cleanline&s;s. It for|merly prevailed in Italy, Spain, France, Germany, Holland, and, occa&s;ionally, in Britain and Ireland, under the names of putrid, malignant, and bilious fevers, al&s;o of the <HI>gall &s;ickne&s;s</HI> and of the <HI>black fever.</HI> The la&s;t name was derived from the
<PB N="xxii" REF="035335_0129_1002332B8C6E0D78">
black vomiting, which is &s;o often the &s;ymptom of approach|ing death in bilious fevers.</P>
<P>We are the more confirmed in the opinion we have deliver|ed, that the yellow fever is a native di&s;ea&s;e of our country, by di&s;covering that the &s;ame opinion is held by mo&s;t of the phy&s;icians and citizens of our &s;i&s;ter &s;tates. We lament the prevalence of an opinion, that the admi&s;&s;ion of truth upon this &s;ubject, will injure the credit of our city. Truth, upon all &s;ubjects is ultimately friendly to general intere&s;t and hap|pine&s;s, while the remedies of the evils of error, are always of a partial and tran&s;itory nature. We conceive that the report of the exi&s;tence of a di&s;ea&s;e of a nature &s;o &s;ubtle as to elude the utmo&s;t force of the health laws, and the greate&s;t vigilance of health-officers, will be much more injurious to our city, than a belief of its being derived from cau&s;es which are ob|vious to our &s;en&s;es, and which, by active exertions, might be ea&s;ily and certainly removed, without oppre&s;&s;ing or injuring our commerce.</P>
<P>We &s;hall repeat, in this place, the means recommended by us in our former letter, with the addition of &s;ome others, for preventing a return of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1. "Removing all tho&s;e matters from our &s;treets, gutters, cellars, gardens, yards, &s;tores, vaults, ponds, &amp;c. which, by putrefaction in warm weather, afford the mo&s;t frequent cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e in this country. For this purpo&s;e, we recommend the appointment of a certain number of phy&s;i|cians, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it &s;hall be, to in&s;pect all &s;uch places in the city, the Northern Liberties and Southwark, as contain any matters, capable by putrefaction, of producing the di&s;ea&s;e, and to have them removed.</P>
<P N="2">2. "We earne&s;tly recommend the frequent wa&s;hing of all impure parts of the city in warm and dry weather, by means of the pumps, until the water of the river Schuylkill can be made to wa&s;h all the &s;treets of the city; a mea&s;ure which we conceive promi&s;es to our citizens, the mo&s;t durable exemp|tion from bilious fevers of all kinds, of dome&s;tic origin.</P>
<P N="3">3. "To guard again&s;t the frequent &s;ource of yellow fever from the noxious air in the holds of ve&s;&s;els, we recommend the unlading &s;uch ve&s;&s;els, as contain cargoes liable to putre|faction, and the di&s;charging the balla&s;t of all ve&s;&s;els at a di&s;|tance from the city, during the months of June, July, Au|gu&s;t, September and October. To prevent the generation of noxious air in the holds of ve&s;&s;els, we conceive every ve&s;|&s;el &s;hould be obliged, by law, to carry and u&s;e a ventilator, and
<PB N="xxiii" REF="035335_0130_10023332499DDA60">
we recommend in a particular manner, the one lately invent|ed by Mr. Benjamin Wynkoop. We believe this invention to be one of the mo&s;t important and u&s;eful that has been made in modern times, and that it is calculated to prevent not only the decay of &s;hips and cargoes, but a very frequent &s;ource of pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es of all kinds in commercial ci|ties."</P>
<P N="4">4. The filling up, or cleaning the docks in &s;uch a manner, that no matters, capable of putrefaction, &s;hall be expo&s;ed to the rays of the &s;un at low water.</P>
<P N="5">5. The clo&s;ing the common &s;ewers, &s;o as to admit water only, and the daily removal of the filth of the city, de&s;tined to flow into them, by means of covered carts or waggons made for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P N="6">6. The prevention of the filth of the city from being accu|mulated, and &s;tagnating in its neighbourhood.</P>
<P N="7">7. The prohibition of alleys and narrow &s;treets in the fu|ture improvement of the city.</P>
<P N="8">8. An alteration of the pre&s;ent health law, which, by de|taining ve&s;&s;els with peri&s;hable cargoes for ten days at the ho&s;|pital, in hot weather, is calculated to increa&s;e the foul air in their holds; and we recommend al&s;o, that no ve&s;&s;el, owned by a citizen of Philadelphia, be permitted to leave or enter our ports, that is not provided with a ventilator.</P>
<P>We &s;hall conclude our letter by deprecating, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, the continuance of a belief in the &s;uppo&s;ed importation of our fever, an opinion which has led to the to|tal negligence of the means of preventing its return; al&s;o by humbly hoping that a merciful Providence may not correct our ignorance and prejudices, by frequent returns of a cala|mity, which has in five years &s;wept away ten thou&s;and of our inhabitants, and which in a few years may, if not obviated by the only proper remedies, (under the influence of the pre&s;ent inflammatory con&s;titution of the atmo&s;phere) annihilate our city.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER from the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Penn&s;yl|vania, by direction of the Governor, relative to the late Ma|lignant Fever, to the Board of Health.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Governor is de&s;irous of &s;ubmitting to the legi&s;lature, a comprehen&s;ive view of the mortality and expenditure, pro|duced by the calamity, which has recently afflicted the city and its &s;uburbs. He, therefore, directs me to reque&s;t, that you will favour him with a report, and the nece&s;&s;ary docu|ments, upon the &s;ubject. The information contemplated may be properly embraced, perhaps, by the following enquiries.</P>
<P>1&s;t. At what time, in what place, and in what manner, was the malignant fever introduced into the city and &s;uburbs?</P>
<P>2d. How long did the fever continue to rage, and what is the number of its victims?</P>
<P>3d. What was the general police pur&s;ued by the Board, the over&s;eers of the poor, and their agents, to &s;ubdue, or mitigate the di&s;ea&s;e, to aid the &s;ick, to inter the dead, and to maintain the poor?</P>
<P>4th. What &s;um has been rai&s;ed on this occa&s;ion, by taxes, by voluntary loan, and by gratuitous contributions; what &s;um has been expended, and what balance remains on hand?</P>
<P>5th. What is the number and condition of the citizens who have been relieved, and will any extraordinary aid be nece&s;|&s;ary, on the part of the legi&s;lature, for the &s;upport of the poor during the en&s;uing winter?</P>
<P>6th. What precautions ought to be taken to prevent the recurrence of &s;o dreadful a calamity?</P>
<P>Permit me to add, that it is the governor's wi&s;h, that the over&s;eers of the poor, and, particularly tho&s;e active citizens, who &s;uperintended the bu&s;ine&s;s of the camps, &s;hould be con|&s;ulted in forming your report. As the legi&s;lature meets on the 4th of December, I hope it will be convenient for you to comply with the governor's reque&s;t, in the cour&s;e of the pre|&s;ent month.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE &s;ecretary of the commonwealth, in a communica|tion of the 8th <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lt. by your direction, having propounded certain queries relative to the late dreadful calamity, a &s;en&s;e of duty, common intere&s;t, and a poignant retro&s;pect of the pa&s;t &s;cenes of mi&s;ery and wretchedne&s;s, which came more im|mediately under our care, have excited an inten&s;e &s;olicitude and a&s;&s;iduity, on our part, to an&s;wer &s;atisfactorily your en|quiries, and devi&s;e means for the prevention of &s;o terrible a &s;courge in future.</P>
<P>We regret that the continuance of the di&s;ea&s;e to &s;o late a period has delayed the adju&s;tment of the accounts of the in|&s;titutions under our direction, and will con&s;equently deprive us of that accuracy which is de&s;irable. We believe, however, that the report will not ultimately be found materially in|correct.</P>
<P>A few preliminary remarks, relative to the precautions which have been taken in order to prevent the importation of di&s;ea&s;e, may not be &s;uperfluous.</P>
<P>The law, in re&s;pect to quarantine, has been con&s;trued and executed in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e. Every power and effort which the board, or the officers under their direction, were capable of exerci&s;ing, has been employed to cut off all communica|tion with the ve&s;&s;els under quarantine.&mdash;Every po&s;&s;ible mode of purification, which a law &s;o manife&s;tly defective would permit, has been adopted, and the mo&s;t rigid &s;crutiny had, before the ve&s;&s;els were permitted to proceed to the city.</P>
<P>At the Marine Ho&s;pital, the fences were extended into the river, the more completely to enclo&s;e the premi&s;es, and all in|tercour&s;e therewith precluded.</P>
<P>For the &s;ake of per&s;picuity we &s;hall conform, as near as po&s;&s;ible, to the order in which you have pre&s;ented the &s;everal &s;ubjects of enquiry; and</P>
<P>1&s;t. The malignant fever, according to our information, fir&s;t made its appearance in Water-&s;treet, between Spruce and Walnut-&s;treets, about the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t. Several re|&s;pectable phy&s;icians declare that it appeared in the month of June; and, that many unequivocal ca&s;es occurred early in July.</P>
<P><PB N="xxvi" REF="035335_0133_1002333D35578480">
Un&s;hackled by prejudice, and diffident of opinion, we have endeavoured to trace the di&s;ea&s;e to its origin, but without &s;ucce&s;s. Tho&s;e objects which have been pointed to with the greate&s;t confidence as the foreign &s;ource of the di&s;ea&s;e, on in|ve&s;tigation, afford no &s;uch proof.</P>
<P>Thus &s;ituated, it would be indecorous, in an official report to the chief magi&s;trate, to &s;ub&s;titute opinion for fact. We deem a que&s;tion, on which the lives of thou&s;ands and the pro&s;perity or annihilation of our flouri&s;hing city may depend, of too much importance to re&s;t upon the <HI>exclu&s;ive &s;peculation</HI> of either foreign or dome&s;tic origin.</P>
<P>In our an&s;wer to your 6th query, we &s;hall endeavour to de&s;ignate &s;uch general mea&s;ures as, when properly dige&s;ted by legi&s;lative wi&s;dom, are, in our judgement, be&s;t calculated to guard again&s;t the recurrence of &s;o fatal a malady from either dome&s;tic or foreign &s;ources.</P>
<P>2d. The di&s;ea&s;e continued to rage until about the fir&s;t of November; and, partially, until about the 5th. The whole number of victims, exclu&s;ive of tho&s;e who died in the coun|try, are three thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and forty five.</P>
<P>3d. The City Ho&s;pital was opened on the 7th Augu&s;t&mdash;all ve&s;&s;els were immediately removed by order of the Board from all the wharves included between Mr. Levi Holling&s;worth's and Tun Alley.&mdash;The Board publicly admoni&s;hed the inha|bitants of the infected neighbourhood to remove without delay.&mdash;A quantity of damaged coffee and cocoa, imported on the 30th July, and &s;tored in Ro&s;s's &s;tores, was reported on the 3d Augu&s;t to the Board to be in a putrid &s;tate. It was immediately put on board the ve&s;&s;el in which it was impor|ted, and &s;ent down to the Marine Ho&s;pital for purification.</P>
<P>Two &s;kilful phy&s;icians and two a&s;&s;i&s;tants were appointed to re&s;ide at the City Ho&s;pital, with a competent number of nur&s;es and attendants, and every thing nece&s;&s;ary for the com|fort and relief of the patients was provided. All the powers of rea&s;oning, per&s;ua&s;ion, and authority, which the Board po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed, &s;hort of ab&s;olute coercion, were a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly employed to induce the &s;ick to remove in&s;tantly to the Ho&s;pital; for which purpo&s;e carriages con&s;tantly attended, and litters were con&s;tructed as &s;peedily as po&s;&s;ibly, to convey them with ea&s;e and convenience.</P>
<P>All the regular practi&s;ing phy&s;icians of the city and li|berties were authorized to grant orders for admi&s;&s;ion into the City Ho&s;pital.&mdash;Hear&s;es and per&s;ons were employed for the &s;peedy removal and interment of the dead, and the Health-Office
<PB N="xxvii" REF="035335_0134_100233402362DA68">
kept open day and night, for the purpo&s;e of receiving applications and executing the duties of the office with promptitude.</P>
<P>In order to a&s;certain the progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e and form &s;ome criterion by which to judge of its exten&s;ion or decline, as well as to mark tho&s;e parts of the city and liberties in which it raged with the greate&s;t violence, a &s;uitable per&s;on was appointed to obtain from the phy&s;icians the daily reports of new ca&s;es which occurred in their practice &s;everally, toge|ther with the names and re&s;idence of the patients.</P>
<P>Skilful phy&s;icians were appointed to attend the poor of the city and liberties, and medicines provided for their u&s;e at the expence of the in&s;titution.</P>
<P>The buildings at the City Ho&s;pital being found in&s;ufficient, a hou&s;e contiguous thereto was rented; the &s;ummer hou&s;es were covered with canvas, a number of &s;heds, and a new frame building 60 by 20 feet, two &s;tories high, were erected for the better accommodation of the &s;ick.</P>
<P>The alarming progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e, and frightful increa&s;e of mortality; the apparent temerity or apathy of &s;ome, and the indigence and di&s;tre&s;s of others, impelled the Board to reiterate in terms the mo&s;t impre&s;&s;ive, their admonitions to the inhabitants who were in circum&s;tances to abandon their homes; and, in conjuction with the Guardians of the poor, to provide a retreat for the indigent.</P>
<P>Tents were accordingly erected on the ea&s;t bank of Schuyl|kill, to which they were invited to re&s;ort, and ample provi|&s;ion was there made for their comfort and &s;upport. The&s;e mea&s;ures being inadequate to the urgency of the occa&s;ion, temporary buildings for the accommodation of near two thou&s;and per&s;ons were erected on Ma&s;ters' ground, two miles above the city.</P>
<P>The regulation and &s;uperintendance of each encampment was confided to a committee of re&s;pectable and humane citi|zens, who voluntarily undertook the arduous ta&s;k.</P>
<P>By the joint authority of the Board of Managers and the Board of Guardians of the poor, a committee of re&s;pectable citizens were appointed for the di&s;tribution of relief to the poor of the city and liberties, who&s;e &s;ituation rendered it im|proper to remove to the tents.</P>
<P>The infected hou&s;es and bedding were clean&s;ed and puri|fied, by order of the Board, &s;o far as was found practicable. This, however, was but partial, owing to the inevitable diffi|culties and confu&s;ion occa&s;ioned by the calamity.</P>

<P>Exclu&s;ive of the above expenditures and numbers of per&s;ons relieved, the guardians of the poor have incurred a very great and extraordinary expence for the relief of orphans and per|&s;ons di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by the calamity.</P>
<P>5th. The poor will, doubtle&s;s, require extraodinary aid from the legi&s;lature the en&s;uing winter, in con&s;equence of the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of labour during the prevalence of the di&s;ea&s;e, the extraordinary expen&s;es incurred by &s;ickne&s;s, or removal from the city, and, in all probability, a &s;hort interval from the re|turn of the citizens to the clo&s;ing of the navigation for the ex|erci&s;e of indu&s;try.</P>
<P>6th. No que&s;tion can be more intere&s;ting, none more en|titled to &s;erious con&s;ideration, than that which &s;hall deter|mine the precautions to be adopted, in order to prevent the recurrence of a calamity &s;o de&s;tructive. Accordingly, we find our fellow citizens generally engaged in the contempla|tion and di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Whatever difference of opinion may exi&s;t as to its origin, all appear to agree in the general &s;y&s;tem of police nece&s;&s;ary to guard again&s;t its introduction in future.</P>
<P>The idea of re&s;orting to the legi&s;lature of the union, for an act to interdict the commerce from the Mediterranean and We&s;t-Indies, during the &s;ummer months, appears to be general, and if attainable, would certainly be mo&s;t de&s;irable, at lea&s;t until &s;ome effectual &s;y&s;tem &s;hall be divi&s;ed and com|pletely ready for execution.</P>
<P>The great diver&s;ity of &s;entiment which appears to prevail in the different &s;tates, relative to the origin of the di&s;ea&s;e, toge|ther with the powerful influence of commercial intere&s;t and rival&s;hip, may create in&s;urmountable ob&s;tacles to the attain|ment of an efficient law from the general government.</P>
<P><PB N="xxxi" REF="035335_0138_10023352727DF2F8">
Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, we think it will be prudent to per&s;evere with energy in an application to the &s;tate legi&s;lature, for effectual quarantine and health laws, with liberal endow|ments for the &s;upport of the &s;everal in&s;titutions. It may here be proper to ob&s;erve that a well dige&s;ted quarantine law of this &s;tate will be nece&s;&s;ary (even in the event of a law of the general government) to provide for the ea&s;e of ve&s;&s;els which may enter our port from &s;tre&s;s of weather, or other ca&s;ualty during the period of interdiction.</P>
<P>We take the liberty of &s;ugge&s;ting the propriety of an ap|plication to the governments of the &s;tates of Delaware and New-Jer&s;ey for their co-operation. The principles of com|mon intere&s;t and &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, and their participation in the late calamity, mu&s;t dictate to them the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch a coalition.</P>
<P>A quarantine law to be effectual &s;hould make provi&s;ion for the following objects.</P>
<P>An in&s;ular &s;ituation, remote from the city, &s;hould be &s;e|lected, if practicable, for the place of quarantine; if none &s;uch can be obtained, forty or fifty acres on &s;ome convenient part of the Delaware &s;hore &s;hould be &s;ecured by a high and &s;trong enclo&s;ure&mdash;wharves, ware hou&s;es, and other &s;uitable buildings &s;hould be erected for the reception and purification of cargoes and accommodation of per&s;ons.</P>
<P>All ve&s;&s;els from the Mediterranean and We&s;t-Indies, from the fir&s;t of June to the fir&s;t October, &s;hould there di&s;charge their cargoes, which, together with the ve&s;&s;els, &s;hould be thoroughly purified, and perform a quarantine of at lea&s;t 20 days. Guards &s;hould be con&s;tantly po&s;ted at all the avenues, and guard boats &s;tationed around the fleet.</P>
<P>The law &s;hould provide for the prohibition of intercour&s;e by land or water with &s;uch of our &s;i&s;ter &s;tates as may not a|dopt efficient quarantine laws; and interdict all communi|cation with infected places.</P>
<P>Having de&s;ignated tho&s;e general regulations, which we conceive are be&s;t adapted to guard again&s;t the importation of di&s;ea&s;e, we &s;hall take the liberty of adverting to mea&s;ures, which appear to us no le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to the health and pro&s;|perity of our city.</P>
<P>If the dome&s;tic origin of the di&s;ea&s;e is denied, yet it mu&s;t be allowed that local cau&s;es have a potent effect in its diffu&s;ion, and encrea&s;ing its malignity; of this, fatal experience has furni&s;hed an irrefragable proof in the exce&s;&s;ive mortality, and number of the di&s;ea&s;ed, in particular parts of the city and li|berties.</P>
<P><PB N="xxxii" REF="035335_0139_1002335653468260">
We believe that the&s;e dreadful con&s;equences would be greatly mitigated, if not wholly averted, by a judicious refor|mation in the police of the city and liberties.</P>
<P>The introduction of whole&s;ome running water for dome&s;tic purpo&s;es, and for wa&s;hing the &s;treets, and common &s;ewers, is in our judgment, an object of primary importance; the clean&s;ing of all the docks to a depth below the level of low water mark, a &s;trict attention to the removal of all filth and putrifying &s;ub&s;tances, and correcting the noxious effluvia from the privies in the commencement of the hot &s;ea&s;on, would, we conceive, be productive of the happie&s;t effects.</P>
<P>The great attention which has been paid to the clean&s;ing of the be&s;t improved parts of our city, and the obvious ne|glect of remote and confined &s;ituations, has long been a &s;ub|ject of &s;erious complaint.</P>
<P>Any work, however great, will be but partial whil&s;t the &s;tagnant pools, and filth of the narrow lanes, alleys and yards, in the extremities of the city, and particularly in the di&s;tricts of Southwark and the Nothern Liberties, are &s;uffered to exi&s;t.</P>
<P>We beg leave to call your attention to a &s;ubject which we con&s;ider as deeply intere&s;ting.</P>
<P>The e&s;tabli&s;hment of a City Ho&s;pital upon an enlarged plan, permanently provided with every thing nece&s;&s;ary for the comfort and relief of the &s;ick, and &s;kilful profe&s;&s;ors, nur&s;es, &amp;c. provi&s;ionally engaged in the event of a recur|rence of the di&s;ea&s;e, would excite public confidence, and greatly dimini&s;h the evils of the calamity. The &s;ituation of the pre&s;ent City Hi&s;pital, we con&s;ider as highly improper for the purpo&s;e, from its contiguity to the mar&s;hes of the Schuylkill. The lots and improvements thereon, if &s;old, would, probably produce a &s;um equivalent to the purcha&s;e of an elevated &s;ituation, and the completion of buildings bet|ter adapted to the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>We have been led into unavoidable prolixity from the mag|nitude of the &s;ubject, and a wi&s;h to contribute the re&s;ult of our experience and ob&s;ervations. Should they produce, in any degree, the de&s;ired effect, it will alleviate the recollection of tho&s;e painful &s;cenes which it was our lot to witne&s;s, and our duty to relieve.</P>
