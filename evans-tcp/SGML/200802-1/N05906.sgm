<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR mo&s;t e&s;teemed came to Hand on the 15th In&s;tant: I duly peru&s;ed it, and was highly plea&s;ed to &s;ee your generous Concern for the Publick, and Pity for the Individuals; and the many Schemes you had projected for the Advantage of both; which confirmed me in the Opinion I had long entertained of you, as a Gentleman of a publick benevolent Spirit; but was really &s;urprized, when you de&s;ired my Opinion concerning the Law of Bankruptcy, as to the Expediency or Non-Expediency, of having that, or one as near like it as may be, made in this Colony, for the Relief of in&s;olvent Debtors; for as the Study of Politicks has not been my Bu&s;ine&s;s, I really e&s;teem my&s;elf a very incompetent Judge: However any Service I can render, you may freely command: I will &s;ugge&s;t &s;ome Thoughts on the Subject, for your private Reflection, but &s;hall not be anxious in the Affair; being per&s;uaded your Candour will pardon a Thou&s;and Faults. But to proceed:</P>
<P>I conceive there are &s;carcely any Rea&s;ons for &s;uch an Act in <HI>England,</HI> but what hold good with regard to the Plantations in <HI>America;</HI> which are much upon a Par; Debtors and Creditors being much the &s;ame in the Plantations as at home; and in as much as the Legi&s;lative Body at home, have made an Act for the Ea&s;e and Benefit of Bankrupts, or in&s;olvent Debtors; we may conclude they judged it beneficial to the State in general, all Things con&s;idered, tho' &s;ome Individuals might po&s;&s;ibly &s;ometimes be injured by it, which I hope to prove by-and-by &s;eldom happens to be the Ca&s;e. I have long thought &s;uch an Act the proper Object of our Legi&s;lature's Attention, for this Rea&s;on, that it might be of publick Service (tho' there are many others) and &s;hall therefore the more chearfully give my Thoughts on the Subject, hoping it may give Occa&s;ion to a much abler Pen [yours] to take the Affair in Hand, which I doubt not is &s;ufficient fully to evince the Expediency, Impor|tance and Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch an Act.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="007495_0003_102D73ED405F3318">
I &s;hall con&s;ider this Act in the
<LIST>
<ITEM>FIRST PLACE, <HI>As beneficial to the Publick,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>SECONDLY, <HI>Serviceable in general to the Debtor.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>THIRDLY, <HI>In general, no Di&s;&s;ervice to the Creditor.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>FOURTHLY, <HI>Agreeable to Rea&s;on, and the Genius of our holy Religion.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I can't but hope, if I &s;hould be &s;o happy as to prove &s;uch an Act beneficial to the Publick; generally a Service to the Debtor; &s;eldom a Di&s;&s;ervice to the Creditor, and always con&s;i&s;tent with Rea&s;on, and the Genius and Temper of our holy Religion; that this Colony may be induced (through your Influence) to follow the Example of its Mother-Country; and po&s;&s;ibly the rather, as one of our neighbouring Colonies have lately done the &s;ame: And as the &s;ame has lately been recommended to be done, to the Government of <HI>Virginia;</HI> what Advantage it will give tho&s;e Colonies over us I leave you to judge.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> then, An Act of Bankruptcy, I conceive, may be beneficial to the Publick in two Re&s;pects.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, it might be beneficial, as it would &s;ave a good deal of Expence, and prevent many ill Con&s;equences. Let us view a Man who is an in&s;olvent Debtor, pro&s;ecuted according to Form of Law, and impri&s;oned (I had almo&s;t &s;aid Divine Law, and under that terrible Sentence, <HI>Thou &s;halt not come out thence till thou ha&s;t paid the utmo&s;t Farthing,</HI>) there to be holden by Law till the Debt be di&s;charged, How many Evils will unavoidably ari&s;e to the Publick! Is the Man there ever like to di&s;charge the Debt? No; that Place is not a Place for Improvement but Puni&s;h|ment: What will be the Con&s;equence then? This without Di&s;pute; if the Man has 1000<HI>l.</HI> or 10,000 <HI>l.</HI> of his Creditor's E&s;tate in his Hands, he will con&s;ume it in &s;uch a Manner (in a Thou&s;and Ways too tedious to be mentioned) that neither his Creditor or the Publick will be bene|fitted by it: Such Lo&s;&s;es are impoveri&s;hing to the Publick; be&s;ides the Publick will lo&s;e entirely the Benefit of the Man's Labour during the Time of his Confinement; if not altogether that of his Family, yet very much of it; as the Family is de&s;titute of its Head and Guide. How fatal would &s;uch In&s;tances, if they &s;hould be multiplied, prove to the Publick! for upon a moderate Computation, every In&s;tance &s;ubjects the Publick to a Lo&s;s of 5 or 600<HI>l. per Annum;</HI> and 'tis more than probable, that In&s;tances will be multiplied to our Sorrow, if we do not prevent them by a&s;certaining the Value of our Medium, the Uncertainty of which has ruined many; or pa&s;s &s;ome Acts for their Relief. Now under what Obligation the Publick can be to &s;uffer &s;uch Lo&s;&s;es (e&s;pecially when its
<PB N="3" REF="007495_0004_102D73EEFAD8AAB0">
not like to &s;erve any good End) I leave to tho&s;e that are better Judges of Obligations than I am, to determine. The Lo&s;s is yet more con&s;i|&s;iderable, &s;hould this Man, (thus impri&s;oned) being an hone&s;t Man, (which may be the Ca&s;e) be a Man of Skill and Experience in Merchan|dize, (which by the Bye are &s;uch Attainments that every Man does not attain to, tho' many are &s;o happy as to blunder into an E&s;tate without them) who, by the Badne&s;s of the Times in Trade, or by the mere Providence of GOD, has been reduced: Or &s;hould he be a Man of known Ingenuity, either in Literature or in any of the mechanical Arts, which are beneficial to Mankind; as the Goal is no Place for the Improvement of a Man's Skill, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I could mention many more ill Con&s;equences that attend a Confinement; but I will only ob&s;erve, that this Man (after having been fatigued, plagued and di&s;graced with a four or five Years Impri&s;onment, which he looks upon (often ju&s;tly) rather as a Piece of Revenge and Ill-nature, and done rather in Compliance to the malicious Temper of a haughty Creditor, than with any View to the Good of him&s;elf, his Creditor, or the Publick) is generally either &s;o much lo&s;t as to any Sen&s;e of Honour or Ambition, or is &s;o much depre&s;&s;ed in his Spirits, and out of Humour with Mankind, or has contracted &s;o &s;trong a Habit of Idlene&s;s, tho' he &s;hould be &s;o happy as to e&s;cape that of Intemperance in Drink, and maintain a good Con&s;titution, which few under tho&s;e Circum&s;tances do; he is never like any more to be of any great Service to him&s;elf or any Body el&s;e. The&s;e are &s;ome of the Evils &s;uch an Act would prevent. Moreover, as a Pri&s;on is generally the Con&s;equence of a Failure in this Government, which (under our pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances) in the Apprehen&s;ion of Men, &s;o much re&s;embles the final Puni&s;hment of Wickedne&s;s, they imagine, the Man that is &s;o un|happy as to be doomed to that Place, is not only become a Bankrupt as to his Fortune, but as to his Faith and Honour; and generally treat him as &s;uch; which gives Mankind &s;uch terrible Apprehen&s;ions with regard to the Con&s;equences of a Failure; that let a Man's Integrity be almo&s;t what it will, if his Fortune is declining and &s;inking, 'tis ten to one, if, in order to &s;ave him&s;elf, he does not pur&s;ue &s;uch Mea&s;ures (his Temp|tations being almo&s;t invincible) as really bankrupts both his Faith and Fortune: Whereas did we believe, that a Man might be a Bankrupt, and yet be a Man of Honour and Fidelity; in this Ca&s;e, a Man in declining Circum&s;tances, of a common Degree of Hone&s;ty, (his Temp|tations not being in any Mea&s;ure &s;o great as in the other Ca&s;e) would in ordinary act quite a different Part, a Part more friendly to Vertue, more
<PB N="4" REF="007495_0005_102D73F0A1EEB4E0">
healthful to the Publick, le&s;s detrimental to his Creditors, and by far &s;afer and more honourable for him&s;elf. But,</P>
<P>Secondly, it might be beneficial, as it would be productive of much po&s;itive Good. When I was in <HI>England,</HI> I was informed, and I take it to be Fact, that there are Thou&s;ands of Gentlemen who have proved Bankrupts, and have upon the Statute, delivered up their Effects to their proper Owners, began the World anew, and are now Men of di&s;tingui&s;hed Characters in the mercantile Life; who by their Skill in and Application to Bu&s;ine&s;s, have procured va&s;t Fortunes. This every one will allow to be a publick Good: But this could never have been the Ca&s;e with tho&s;e Gentlemen, had they been under the unhappy Circum&s;tances that our Debtors are.</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible, that tho&s;e Men who prove in&s;olvent, are commonly branded as Villains, and judged unworthy any more to be entru&s;ted with any of the Concerns of this Life: I am &s;orry that this Brand is fixed on every one of this Character, &s;o much without Di&s;tinction. Some Villains I grant there are; but then I would ob&s;erve, that there are a great many Men, Men of Probity and Honour, who not being &s;ufficiently in&s;tructed in the Nature of Trade, have, either with a &s;mall or with a large Fortune, which is much the &s;ame in the Quotient if they over-trade, put them&s;elves into Bu&s;ine&s;s of this Nature, and have over-traded their Stock; which has been the Cau&s;e of their Ruin: The&s;e unfortunate Gentlemen have purcha&s;ed their Skill at a dear Rate; but are now po&s;&s;i|bly qualified for the Bu&s;ine&s;s, which heretofore they were not capable of managing; if &s;o, why &s;hould the Publick be deprived of the Service, which by Experience (dear to them&s;elves) they are now capable and willing to render? Moreover, &s;ome Men are render'd in&s;olvent by the mere Providence of God, (which by Statute &s;hould hurt no Man) &s;hould the&s;e Men be deemed as Villains, becau&s;e they are &s;ubject to a Fate that is unavoidable? and becau&s;e God, who gives the good Things of this Life as it plea&s;es him, has not given with &s;o liberal a Hand to the&s;e Men as to others, for Rea&s;ons be&s;t known to him&s;elf; &s;hall the&s;e unhappy Men therefore be denied the Privilege and Plea&s;ure of breathing the common Air, to which the Birds and Bea&s;ts are welcome? and becau&s;e God di&s;ciplines, &s;hall Men puni&s;h?</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e the Wor&s;t, that the&s;e Men have render'd them&s;elves in&s;olvent by their own wicked immoral Conduct; I a&s;k, will it &s;erve any good Purpo&s;es in the State, to commit the&s;e Men to Goal? will the Publick be benefitted by it; will their Creditors, or will they them&s;elves?
<PB N="5" REF="007495_0006_102D73F26A5F4E28">
I believe neither, for Rea&s;ons before a&s;&s;igned; then there can be no good Rea&s;ons why they &s;hould be committed, in Manner and Form notwith|&s;tanding. Shall they be committed as Sinners? No certainly! as &s;uch they are accountable to the highe&s;t Tribunal, and to that only. We may be thought to be tolerable good Judges as to Property, <HI>mea &amp; tua, commoda &amp; incommoda;</HI> but as to Virtue and Vice as &s;uch, we are in&s;uf|ficient Judges: As to Virtue and Vice, there are &s;o many Things to be counted upon, that He only who knows all Things is a proper Judge.</P>
<P>I a&s;k Pardon for this long Digre&s;&s;ion, and now ob&s;erve more perti|nently to this Head, that an Act for the Ea&s;e of Bankrupts, is productive of Good to the Publick in this Re&s;pect, that whatever Effects the in&s;ol|vent Debtor has in his Hands, in&s;tead of con&s;uming of it to no good Purpo&s;e, he returns it to his Creditors, for them to improve, to the Advantage of them&s;elves, and con&s;equently of the Publick: This affects the Publick in a two-fold Ratio; fir&s;t by &s;aving the Intere&s;t, and &s;econdly by applying of it to good Purpo&s;es; and is &s;imilar to taking a Weight out of one Scale, and putting it into the other, in the general Ballance; one Pound thus applied makes two odds. 'Tis moreover productive of Good, as it is a Motive and Incitement to Indu&s;try. Suppo&s;e a Man in&s;olvent, that he owes large Sums of Money, and has Nothing to di&s;|charge them with, if he is put into Goal, there is no Opportunity or Motive for Indu&s;try; his Thoughts and Concern there, are to no Manner of Purpo&s;e; and if after he has been di&s;graced and plagued with a long Confinement, he &s;hould take the Poor-Man's Oath, and in that Manner obtain Goal-Delivery, his Spirits are &s;o &s;unk with the Weight of his Debts, he has no Heart to contrive or work for his Relief, and in Con|&s;equence will do Nothing to Purpo&s;e: He imagines (as the Proverb is) he is <HI>working for a dead Hor&s;e;</HI> and that he is Nothing but a Slave to his Creditors; that he is like never to po&s;&s;e&s;s any Thing for him&s;elf or Family, and &s;o the remaining Part of Life is lo&s;t (and wor&s;e than lo&s;t) to him&s;elf, his Creditors, and to the Publick: Of this every Man's Experience abundantly convinces him. For my Part, I never knew an In&s;tance, of any Man, under the&s;e Circum&s;tances, ever making any Thing for him&s;elf, or any Body el&s;e; but was he take Benefit by the Act of Bankruptcy, and deliver up his Effects to his Creditors, and begin the World anew, he might be encouraged to Frugality and Indu&s;try, and do every Thing in his Power to make an Intere&s;t for him&s;elf, as every Thing that he &s;hould then acquire would be his own. But before I proceed to the next Head, I &s;hall obviate the following Objection, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="007495_0007_102D73F430FCA258">
<HI>That the Government cannot, in Equity, di&s;charge a Debt due from a Debtor to a Creditor, without the Con&s;ent of the Creditor.</HI></P>
<P>To this Objection I an&s;wer in the fir&s;t Place, that as we hold our E&s;tates under the Government, and have all our Intere&s;ts defended and protected by it, it mu&s;t always be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the Government has an equitable Right to in&s;pect our Trade and Commerce one with another, and determine under all Circum&s;tances, when a Man &s;hall be holden, and when di&s;charged. Secondly, I would &s;ay, that a Government is to be con&s;idered as one great Family, and that our E&s;tates, as we are Members of the &s;ame, are properly to be con&s;idered as &s;o many Parts of the Common-Stock; which we are allowed to improve for our own Benefit, but in &s;uch a Form as not to be detrimental to the Government: Of this the Government, or &s;uch Part as &s;hall be appointed for that Purpo&s;e, are the only proper judges; con&s;equently any Contracts we make, if they &s;hould be judged prejudicial to the common Intere&s;t, may be made void, and of none Effect.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, Such an Act would be &s;erviceable in general to Debtors.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, 'tis a Service done to them, as it gives them the Advantage of beginning the World again, and of making an Intere&s;t for them&s;elves and the Publick; which will be a &s;trong Motive to them thus indu&s;tri|ou&s;ly to improve it; and as it delivers them from the Goal, and innu|merable Evils natural and moral, that generally attend it.</P>
<P>2dly, 'Tis a Favour done them, as it delivers them from the Malice and Revenge of their Creditors. The Troubles that attend a Failure, are almo&s;t infinite, and &s;hould really excite our Pity: Why then &s;hould the Publick abandon &s;uch an unhappy Man to the Fury and Re&s;entment of his incen&s;ed Creditors? For, &s;ays an Author, <Q>their Lo&s;&s;es generally &s;our their Tempers, and keep their Re&s;entments warm again&s;t the unhappy Occa&s;ion of them, even to the Extinction &s;ometimes of Humanity: But one &s;hould think, that the Lamentations of a fallen Familiar and Intimate (frequently heighten'd by the Tears of a tender Wife, and affecting Cries of their innocent Babes) would be prevailing Objects to excite Compa&s;&s;ion from tho&s;e who have always experienced a courteous and gentle Treatment from the unhappy Sufferer; but Philanthropy is almo&s;t lo&s;t among&s;t us, and Mankind are grown &s;o degenerate, as to become in&s;en&s;ible to the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of others, much le&s;s to defend them from, or admini&s;ter Relief under them; the unfor|tunate Man is now equally &s;hunn'd with the infected one; and the <HI>be&s;t</HI> U&s;age he finds is Slights from almo&s;t every Individual <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> quondam
<PB N="7" REF="007495_0008_102D73F702475020">
Acquaintance, whil&s;t the <HI>wor&s;t</HI> is &s;welled to an immoderate Height by In&s;ults offered him, Contume<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ies and Reproaches thrown out again&s;t him; and Abu&s;es, Invectives and unmerited A&s;per&s;ions are frequently added, to compleat the Catalogue, and augment his Mi&s;eries; few regard him, fewer &s;till care&s;s him, and the Paucity of tho&s;e who protect or a&s;&s;i&s;t him, are reduced to the lowe&s;t Degree of Compari&s;on.</Q> It appears then, &s;uch an Act would be a Kindne&s;s to a Debtor, and for that Rea&s;on he ought to have the Benefit of it; if there be not a &s;tronger Rea&s;on why he &s;hould not from the Part of the Creditor; which will appear not to be the Ca&s;e, if it &s;hould be found to be no Prejudice to the Creditor in general, for the Debtor thus to be benefitted: Which is the De&s;ign of the next Head.</P>
<P>THIRDLY, I am to con&s;ider this Act as it relates to the Creditors; and &s;ay, 'tis no Di&s;&s;ervice in general to them.</P>
<P>For the Proof of this, I appeal to all Mankind; for they are as good Judges of it as I am: How frequently do we ob&s;erve Bankrupts, or in&s;olvent Debtors, &s;pend their Creditor's E&s;tates in Goal, often large Sums, and after a Length of Time are &s;upported at the Expence of the Creditors until they are tired of it, and finally obtain Goal-Delivery, upon taking the Poor-Man's Oath; and the Creditors, after having &s;uffered the Lo&s;s of large Sums (which might be &s;aved by the Act of Bankruptcy) found to be at a greater Remove from their ju&s;t Dues than ever; and complain that all their Fatigue and Co&s;ts are to no Purpo&s;e: And indeed, where has been a notable In&s;tance to the Contrary? Upon the Whole, we have Rea&s;on to imagine, that the Law of Bankruptcy in general, is rather a Favour than a Prejudice even to the Creditor him&s;elf. But having in Part anticipated my&s;elf on this Head, I proceed to &s;ay,</P>
<P>FOURTHLY, That &s;uch an Act is con&s;i&s;tent with Rea&s;on, and agree|able to the Genius of our holy Religion.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, With Rea&s;on: Rea&s;on con&s;iders all Trade properly as a Barter, an Exchange of one Article for another; as, when I purcha&s;e any Article of Merchandize of a Merchant, I give him another Article, or &s;ecure to give him one in exchange for it; and that Rea&s;on &s;ays, mu&s;t be a <HI>Meum &amp; Tuum,</HI> a Thing that can be mine and then his: So Rea&s;on under&s;tands it, and &s;o Men under&s;tand it. Accordingly the Italians, and we from them practice, as under&s;tanding of it in this Form: For when <HI>A. B.</HI> buys 100 wt. of Piemento of <HI>C. D.</HI> on Time, the Journal po&s;t is not <HI>A. B.</HI> Debiter to <HI>C. D.</HI> properly for 100 wt. of Piemento bought on Time; but Piemento is Debitor to <HI>C. D.</HI> for 100 wt. bought on Time;
<PB N="8" REF="007495_0009_102D73F9106D7D78">
for this plain Rea&s;on, becau&s;e Piemento is the Ground, Foundation or Cau&s;e of <HI>C. D</HI>'s Demand on <HI>A. B.</HI> and not <HI>A. B.</HI> him&s;elf; therefore <HI>C. D.</HI> makes <HI>A. B.</HI> Dr. not to him&s;elf, but to Piemento 100 wt. bought on Time, at <HI>&amp;c.</HI> From whence I argue, that when I purcha&s;e a Quantity of Merchandize of a Merchant, the Merchandize &s;o purcha&s;ed, or the Avails of it, is Debtor to the Merchant, and not I my&s;elf ab&s;tracted from the Merchandize or its Avails. And ina&s;much as it cannot, in ordinary, be determined what are the particular Avails of the Merchan|dize &s;o purcha&s;ed, Rea&s;on will judge every Thing I &s;tand po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of (if Things convertible) to be Avails, and con&s;equently accountable to the Merchant; therefore &s;o long as I &s;tand po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any &s;uch Avails, the Merchant has a proper Foundation for his Demands; for the&s;e Avails are accountable to him, or in other Words are his Debtors properly in the Nature of Things: But if I deliver up the&s;e Avails to the Merchant, or through the Di&s;po&s;ition of Providence have none to deliver up his Demands cea&s;e; becau&s;e the very Things that were accountable, or his Debotrs, cea&s;e to be, or have no Exi&s;tence, and I in Rea&s;on am di&s;|charged: If &s;o, it will from thence follow, that &s;uppo&s;ing I &s;hould begin the World again with Nothing, but what I received with my Being, and &s;hould acquire a &s;econd Intere&s;t in the World, the Merchant, or my Creditor, could have no Demand on me; for as Debtor and Creditor have a joint Exi&s;tence, and can not exi&s;t &s;eparately; if the Debtor die, as in this Ca&s;e, the Creditor dies al&s;o. Moreover, Rea&s;on &s;uppo&s;es, and the Parties &s;uppo&s;e, that whenever a Contract is made, and one Thing is given, or &s;ecured to be given, in Exchange for another, that the Thing &s;o given, or &s;ecured to be given, is an Equivalent to the Thing received: So our Courts of Ju&s;tice under&s;tand it: For if <HI>A.</HI> makes a Demand on <HI>B.</HI> for One Hundred Pounds Money; in order to recover, <HI>A.</HI> is obliged to prove, that <HI>B.</HI> has received the Value of his Demand; which is the &s;ole Foundation of <HI>A</HI>'s Demand again&s;t <HI>B.</HI> Whence then is the Creditor's Demand on the Per&s;on of the Debtor exclu&s;ive of his Intere&s;t? Did the Parties under&s;tand, that at the Time of the Contract, the Debtor obliged his E&s;tate, him&s;elf, Soul and Body, to an&s;wer the Creditor's Demand? If this was the Ca&s;e, Rea&s;on &s;ays the Bargain &s;hall be void <HI>ip&s;o facto;</HI> for the Debtor was over-reached, having never received the Value from the Creditor, of tho&s;e Things which he has &s;ecured to be exchanged for it: If this was their Under&s;tanding, the Soul was under|valued, (and the Debtor ought to have Remedy) if we can rely on the Judgment of Him that made it; for he tells us, that <HI>Thou&s;ands of Rams,</HI>

<HI>and Ten Thou&s;ands of Rivers of Oil,</HI> are not an Equivalent: So that truly, and in the Nature of Things, the Creditor's Demand lies not again&s;t the Per&s;on, but the E&s;tate, of the Debtor. But if it &s;hould be objected, as a Con&s;equence from my Rea&s;oning, that the Per&s;on of the Debtor can in no Ca&s;e be taken and holden; I &s;hall not allow the Con&s;equence; for Rea&s;on &s;uppo&s;es he may be taken and holden, but then 'tis with this View, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that the Creditor may come at the E&s;tate of the Debtor; for the Debtor in this Ca&s;e is con&s;idered only as a Key to the Creditor's Intere&s;t; but when the Creditor has received all the Debtor's E&s;tate, be that an Equivalent to his Demand or not, Rea&s;on &s;ays, he has no Demand on his Per&s;on; that being a Thing that was never under&s;tood to be a Commodity in Trade, there being no Equivalent to it, con&s;equently not to be dealt for. I add, that the Law of Bankruptcy &s;eems to be built upon this Foundation, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that a Creditor's Demand lies again&s;t the E&s;tate, and not again&s;t the Per&s;on, of the Debtor.</P>
<P>But 'tis objected, that this is hard on the Part of the Creditor: 'Tis po&s;&s;ible, I allow, he may be hurt by it, but not very probable; but the Contrary would be much harder on the Part of the Debtor; for in the fir&s;t Ca&s;e, the Creditor lo&s;es only his E&s;tate, but in the &s;econd, the Debtor not only lo&s;es his E&s;tate (which is right) but he lo&s;es him&s;elf al&s;o. I would &s;ay farther, in An&s;wer to this Objection, that Men always trade on this Suppo&s;ition, that 'tis po&s;&s;ible that either the Debtor or the Creditor may lo&s;e their Intere&s;t; and that Things are &s;o uncertain and fluctuating in this Life, that in ordinary, a Man knows not whether his E&s;tate will be mo&s;t &s;ecure in his own Hands, or in the Hands of his Debtor; and that in both Ca&s;es we mu&s;t be concluded by the Determi|nations of Providence.</P>
<P>2dly, I would &s;ay, &s;uch an Act is agreeable to the Genius of our holy Religion. As we are Intelligences of Rank (with Gratitude be it &s;poken to the Author of our Being) we, in the Purpo&s;e of Heaven, are de&s;igned for &s;ocial Happine&s;s, in a World that is to &s;ucceed this: This State there|fore, we now live in, is to be con&s;idered as preparatory to that, and as a State of Trial and Di&s;cipline to qualify us for it: 'Tis nece&s;&s;ary there|fore, that we &s;hould be &s;ubjected in this State to various Troubles and Di&s;tre&s;&s;es; as Lo&s;s of Friends, Sickne&s;s, Poverty, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Hence appears the Nece&s;&s;ity why Men who are to act a Part on this trouble&s;ome Stage, &s;hould be of a benevolent, compa&s;&s;ionate, forgiving Temper: Accor|dingly we &s;ee, that the &s;acred Laws are calculated to beget and promote &s;uch a Temper and Di&s;po&s;ition: <HI>If there be among you a poor Man of one</HI>

How contrary will our Principles appear to tho&s;e of our benevolent Ma&s;ter; if, while he could forgive his Enemies and Per&s;ecutors, and do Good to all as he had Opportunity, we&punc; upon an Affront or Injury done us, &s;hould encourage a Spirit of Re&s;entment and Revenge, pro&s;e|cute every &s;uch Injury, tho' by legal Proce&s;s, to the Utmo&s;t; and by this Means impri&s;on and di&s;tre&s;s our Fellow-Men, and render Life to the la&s;t Degree ta&s;tele&s;s, even to tho&s;e that have as exqui&s;ite a Ta&s;te for Happine&s;s as we, and are the Children of the &s;ame Father, and the Care of the &s;ame Providence.</P>
<P><Q>Let us, &s;ays a celebrated Author, who are his Di&s;ciples, abhor Contention and Revenge; let us not pro&s;ecute every little Injury to the utmo&s;t, nor govern our&s;elves by tho&s;e fal&s;e Maxims of Prudence and Honour, which Pride and Self-Love have introduced on the Ruins of real Chri&s;tianity: Let us not even in the mo&s;t legal Methods, &s;eek the Puni&s;hment of others who have wronged us; except <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Circum&s;tances in which, we are in our Con&s;ciences per&s;uaded, it <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the Whole, be a greater Charity to animadvert on the Offence, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to pa&s;s it by;

and even then, let us act in a calm and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate Manner, pitying and loving the Per&s;ons of the Injurious, even while, for the Sake of Society, we pro&s;ecute their Crimes.</Q></P>
<P>Our Lord tells us, that <HI>the Kingdom of Heaven</HI> (or the Go&s;pel Di&s;pen|&s;ation) <HI>is like to a certain King, who would take Account of his Servants; and when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him which owed him Ten Thou&s;and Talents; but fora&s;much as he had not to pay, his Lord commanded him to be &s;old, and his Wife and Children, and all that he had, and payment to be made: The Servant therefore fell down, and wor&s;hipped him, &s;aying, Lord, have Patience with me, and I will pay thee all: Then the Lord of that Servant was moved with Compa&s;&s;ion, and loo&s;ed him, and forgave him the Debt. But the &s;ame Servant went out, and found one of his Fellow-Servants which owed him an Hundred Pence; and he laid Hands on him, and took him by the Throat, &s;aying, Pay me what thou owe&s;t: And his Fellow-Servant fell down at his Feet, and be&s;ought him, &s;aying, Have Patience with me, and I will pay thee all: And he would not; but went and ca&s;t him into Pri&s;on, till he &s;hould pay the Debt. So when his Fellow-Servants &s;aw what was done, they were very &s;orry, and came and told unto their Lord all that was done. Then his Lord, after that he had called him, &s;aid unto him, O thou wicked Servant, I forgave thee all that Debt, becau&s;e thou de&s;ired&s;t me: Shoulde&s;t not thou al&s;o have Compa&s;&s;ion on thy Fellow-Servant, even as I had Pity on thee? And his Lord was wroth, and delivered him to the Tormentors till he &s;hould pay all that was due unto him. So likewi&s;e &s;hall my heavenly Father do al&s;o unto you, if ye from your Hearts forgive not every one his Brother their Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es.</HI> We are not to under&s;tand, that the Go&s;pel obliges us, to forgive every Man his Debts, upon his de&s;iring the &s;ame; no: but then I think it may well be expected, that tho&s;e who are formed upon the benevolent Principles of our holy Religion, will not, can not, pro&s;ecute, di&s;tre&s;s and impri&s;on tho&s;e of their Fellow-Men, whom Providence has rendered incapable of di&s;|charging their Obligations; and that, if they are really governed by tho&s;e Principles, they will rather di&s;charge their in&s;olvent Debtors, than puni&s;h and impri&s;on them; and e&s;pecially when they have no rea&s;onable Pro&s;pect of &s;erving them&s;elves, or the State, in &s;o doing. How agree|able then would an Act for the Relief of in&s;olvent Debtors, be to the Temper and Genius of our holy Religion! and what a &s;olid Foundation &s;hall we lay for Happine&s;s, as a Body Politick, and as Individuals, if we are really governed by the Maxims and In&s;tructions of our glorious Ma&s;ter! Thus much I have &s;aid, that you may know how much</P>
