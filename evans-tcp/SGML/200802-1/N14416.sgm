<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THE great object, for which I had the honor to hold an appointment in the &s;ervice of my country, being ac|compli&s;hed, I am now preparing to re&s;ign it into the hands of Congre&s;s, and return to that do|me&s;tic retirement, which, it is

well known, I left with the great|e&s;t reluctance; a retirement for which I have never cea&s;ed to &s;igh through a long and painful ab&s;ence, in which (remote from the noi&s;e and trouble of the world) I meditate to pa&s;s the remainder of life, in a &s;tate of undi&s;turbed repo&s;e; but, before I carry this re&s;olution into effect, I think it a duty incumbent on me to make this my la&s;t official communica|tion, to congratulate you on the glorious events which Heaven has been plea&s;ed to produce in our favour, to offer my &s;enti|ments

re&s;pecting &s;ome important &s;ubjects, which appear to me to be intimately connected with the tranquility of the United States, to take my leave of your Excel|lency as a public character, and to give my final ble&s;&s;ing to that country, in who&s;e &s;ervice I have &s;pent the prime of my life; for who&s;e &s;ake I have con&s;umed &s;o many anxious days and watchful nights, and who&s;e happine&s;s, be|ing extremely dear to me, will always con&s;titute no incon&s;idera|ble part of my own.</P>

on this plea&s;ing occa&s;ion, I will claim the indulgence of di|lating the more copiou&s;ly on the &s;ubject of our mutual felicitation. When we con&s;ider the magnitude of the prize we contended for, the doubtful nature of the conte&s;t, and the favourable manner in which it has terminated; we &s;hall find the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible rea&s;on for gratitude and rejoicing; this is a theme that will afford infinite de|light to every benevolent and li|beral mind, wether the event in contemplation be con&s;idered as a &s;ource of pre&s;ent enjoyment,

<P>The citizens of America, placed in the mo&s;t enviable condition, as the &s;ole Lords and Proprie|tors of a va&s;t tract of continent, comprehending all the various &s;oils and climates of the world, and abounding with all the ne|ce&s;&s;aries and conveniencies of life, are now, by the late &s;atis|factory

Nothing can illu&s;trate the&s;e ob|&s;ervations more forcibly than a recollection of the happy con|juncture of times and circum|&s;tances, under which our Re|public a&s;&s;umed its rank among the nations.&mdash;The foundation of our Empire was not laid in a gloomy age of ignorance and &s;u|per&s;tition, but at an epocha when the rights of mankind were bet|ter under&s;tood and more clearly defined, than at any former pe|riod: Re&s;earches of the human

mind after &s;ocial happine&s;s have been carried to a great extent; the trea&s;ures of knowledge ac|quired by the labours of philo&s;o|phers, &s;ages and legi&s;lators, thro' a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of years, are laid open for u&s;e, and their collected wi&s;dom may be happily applied in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of our forms of government. The free culti|vation of letters, the unbounded exten&s;ion of commerce, the pro|gre&s;&s;ive refinement of manners, the growing liberality of &s;enti|ment, and, above all, the pure and benign light of Revelation,

have had a meliorating influence on mankind, and increa&s;ed the ble&s;&s;ings of &s;ociety. At this au|&s;picious period the United States came into exi&s;tence as a nation, and if their citizens &s;hould not be completely free and happy, the fault will be entirely their own.</P>
<P>Such is our &s;ituation, and &s;uch are our pro&s;pects; but notwith|&s;tanding the Cup of Ble&s;&s;ing is thus reached out to us, notwith|&s;tanding happine&s;s is ours, if we have a di&s;po&s;ition to &s;eize the oc|ca&s;ion, and make it our own, yet

it appears to me, there is an op|tion &s;till left to the United States of America, whether they will be re&s;pectable and pro&s;perous, or contemptible and mi&s;erable as a nation; this is the time of their political probation; this is the moment when the eyes of the whole world are turned upon them; this is the moment to e&s;tabli&s;h or ruin their national character for ever; this is the fa|vourable moment to give &s;uch a tone to the fedral Government, as will enable it to an&s;wer the ends of its in&s;titution; or, this

may be the ill-fated moment for relaxing the powers of the Union, annihilating the cement of the Confederation, and ex|po&s;ing us to become the &s;port of European politics, which may play one State again&s;t another, to prevent their growing import|ance, and to &s;erve their own in|tere&s;ted purpo&s;es. For, accord|ing to the &s;y&s;tem of policy the States &s;hall adopt at this mo|ment, they will &s;tand or fall; and, by their confirmation or lap&s;e, it is yet to be decided, whether the Revolution mu&s;t ultimately

<P>With this conviction of the im|portance of the pre&s;ent cri&s;is, &s;i|lence in me would be a crime; I will therefore &s;peak to your Ex|cellency the language of freedom and &s;incerity, without di&s;gui&s;e.

po&s;&s;ibly a&s;cribe to arrogance or o&s;tentation, what I know is alone the re&s;ult of the pure&s;t intention; but the rectitude of my own heart, which di&s;dains &s;uch unworthy motives; the part I have hither|to acted in life, the determinati|on I have formed of not taking any &s;hare in public bu&s;ine&s;s here|after; the ardent de&s;ire I feel, and &s;hall continue to manife&s;t, of quietly enjoying in private life, after all the toils of war, the be|nefits of a wi&s;e and liberal Go|vernment, will, I flatter my&s;elf, &s;ooner or later, convince my coun|trymen,

that I could, have no &s;i|ni&s;ter views in delivering with &s;o little re&s;erve the opinions contain|ed in this addre&s;s.</P>
<P>There are four things which I humbly conceive are e&s;&s;ential to the well-being, I may even ven|ture to &s;ay, to the exi&s;tence of the United States as an indepen|dent power.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. An indi&s;&s;oluble union of the States under one fedral head.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. A &s;acred regard to public ju&s;tice.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. The adoption of a pro|per peace e&s;tabli&s;hment. And,</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="17" REF="018261_0017_0FA5BCDA180C4BB8">4thly. The prevalence of that pacific and friendly di&s;po&s;ition among the people of the United States, which will induce them to forget their local prejudices and policies, to make tho&s;e mu|tual conce&s;&s;ions which are requi|&s;ite to the general pro&s;perity, and, in &s;ome in&s;tances, to &s;acrifice their individual advantages to the intere&s;t of the community.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the pillars on which the glorious fabric of our inde|pendency and national charac|ter mu&s;t be &s;upported.&mdash;Liberty is the ba&s;is&mdash;and whoever would
<PB N="18" REF="018261_0018_0FA5BCDA4A1B14F8">
dare to &s;ap the foundation, or overturn the &s;tructure, under whatever &s;pecious pretext he may attempt it, will merit the bittere&s;t execration, and the &s;evere&s;t pu|ni&s;hment, which can be inflicted by his injured country.</P>
<P>On the three fir&s;t articles I will make a few ob&s;ervations; leaving the la&s;t to the good &s;en&s;e and &s;e|rious con&s;ideration of tho&s;e im|mediately concerned.</P>
<P>Under the fir&s;t head, although it may not be nece&s;&s;ary or proper for me in this place to enter in|to a particular di&s;qui&s;ition of the
<PB N="19" REF="018261_0019_0FA5BCDB16F34268">
principles of the union, and to take up the great que&s;tion which has been frequently agitated, whether it be expedient and re|qui&s;ite for the States to dele|gate a larger proportion of pow|er to Congre&s;s, or not; yet it will be a part of my duty, and that of every true patriot, to a&s;&s;ert, without re&s;erve, and to in&s;i&s;t up|on the following po&s;itions.&mdash; That unle&s;s the States will &s;uffer Congre&s;s to exerci&s;e tho&s;e prero|gatives they are undoubtedly in|ve&s;ted with by the Con&s;titution, every thing mu&s;t very rapidly

tend to anarchy and confu&s;ion. That it is indi&s;pen&s;ible to the happine&s;s of the individual States, that there &s;hould be lodged, &s;ome|where, a &s;upreme power to regu|late and govern the general con|cerns of the confederated Repub|lic, without which the union can|not be of long duration.</P>
<P>That there mu&s;t be a faithful and pointed compliance on the part of every State with the late propo&s;als and demands of Con|gre&s;s, or the mo&s;t fatal con&s;e|quences will en&s;ue&mdash;That what|ever mea&s;ures have a tendency

to di&s;&s;olve the union, or contri|bute to violate or le&s;&s;en the &s;ove|reign authority, ought to be con|&s;idered as ho&s;tile to the Liberty and Independency of America, and the authors of them treated accordingly&mdash;And la&s;tly, that un|le&s;s we can be enabled by the con|currence of the States to partici|pate of the fruits of the Revolu|tion, and enjoy the e&s;&s;ential be|nefits of civil &s;ociety, under a form of government &s;o free and uncorrupted, &s;o happily guarded again&s;t the danger of oppre&s;&s;ion, as has been devi&s;ed and adopted

by the Articles of Confederation, it will be a &s;ubject of regret, that &s;o much blood and trea&s;ure have been lavi&s;hed for no purpo&s;e; that &s;o many &s;ufferings have been encountered without a compen&s;a|tion, and that &s;o many &s;acrifices have been made in vain. Many other con&s;iderations might here be adduced to prove, that with|out an entire conformity to the &s;pirit of the Union, we cannot ex|i&s;t as an independent power. It will be &s;ufficient for my purpo&s;e to mention but one or two, which &s;eem to me of the greate&s;t import|ance.

It is only in our united cha|racter, as an empire, that our ende|pendence is acknowledged, that our power can be regarded, or our credit &s;upported among foreign nations.

We &s;hall be left nearly in a &s;tate of nature, or we may find by our own unhappy experience, that there is a natural and nece&s;|&s;ary progre&s;&s;ion from the extreme of anarchy to the extreme of ty|ranny; and that arbitrary power is

<P>As to the &s;econd article, which re&s;pects the performance of pub|lic ju&s;tice, Congre&s;s have in their late addre&s;s to the United States, almo&s;t exhau&s;ted the &s;ubject; they have explained their ideas &s;o ful|ly, and have enforced the obliga|tions the &s;tates are under to ren|der complete ju&s;tice to all the public creditors, with &s;o much dignity and energy, that, in my opinion, no real friend to the ho|nour and independency of Ame|rica, can he&s;itate a &s;ingle mo|ment

re&s;pecting the propriety of complying with the ju&s;t and ho|nourable mea&s;ures propo&s;ed; if their arguments do not produce conviction, I know of nothing that will have greater influence, e&s;pecially when we recollect that the &s;y&s;tem referred to, being the re&s;ult of the collected wi&s;dom of the Continent, mu&s;t be e&s;teemed, if not perfect, certainly the lea&s;t objectionable of any that could be devi&s;ed; and that, if it &s;hall not be carried into immediate ex|ecution, a national bankruptcy, with all its deplorable con&s;equen|ces,

<P>The ability of the country to di&s;charge the debts, which have been incurred in its defence, is not to be doubted. And inclina|nation, I flatter my&s;elf, will not be wanting; the path of our du|ty is plain before us; hone&s;ty will be found, on every experiment, to be the be&s;t and only true poli|cy. Let us then, as a nation, be

In the mean time let an attention to the chearful performance of their proper bu&s;ine&s;s, as individuals, and as members of &s;ociety, be earne&s;tly inculcated on the citi|zens of America; then will they &s;trengthen the hands of govern|ment, and be happy under its protection.

the fruit of his labours; every one will enjoy his own acqui&s;i|tions, without mole&s;tation, and without danger.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of ab&s;olute free|dom and perfect &s;ecurity, who will grudge to yield a very little of his property to &s;upport the common intere&s;ts of &s;ociety, and en&s;ure the protection of govern|ment? Who does not remember the frequent declarations at the commencement of the war, That we &s;hould be completely &s;ati&s;|fied, if at the expence of one half, we could defend the remainder

Where is the man to be found, who wi&s;hes to remain in debt for the defence of his own per&s;on and property to the exertions, the bravery, and the blood of others, without making one generous effort to repay the debt of honour and of gratitude? In what part of the Continent &s;hall we find any man, or body of men, who would not blu&s;h to &s;tand up, and propo&s;e mea&s;ures purpo&s;ely calculated to rob the &s;oldier of his &s;tipend, and the public creditor of his due?

<P>For my own part, con&s;cious of

<PB N="33" REF="018261_0033_0FA5BCEA1653AED8">
by Congre&s;s, to the officers of the army; from the&s;e commu|nications, my decided &s;entiment will be clearly comprehended, together with the conclu&s;ive rea|&s;ons which induced me, at an early period, to recommend the adoption of this mea&s;ure in the mo&s;t earne&s;t and &s;erious manner. As the proceedings of Congre&s;s, the army, and my&s;elf, are open to all, and contain, in my opi|nion, &s;ufficient information to remove the prejudice and errors which may have been entertain|ed by any, I think it unnece&s;&s;ary

to &s;ay any thing more, than ju&s;t to ob&s;erve, that the re&s;olutions of Congre&s;s, now alluded to, are as undoubtedly and ab&s;olutely binding upon the United States, as the mo&s;t &s;olemn acts of con|federation or legi&s;lation.</P>
<P>As to the idea, which I am in|formed, has, in &s;ome in&s;tances, prevailed, that the half-pay and commutation are to be regarded merely in the odious light of a pen&s;ion, it ought to be exploded for ever: That provi&s;ion &s;hould be viewed, as it really was, a rea|&s;onable compen&s;ation offered by

Congre&s;s, at a time when they had nothing el&s;e to give to officers of the army, for &s;ervices then to be per|formed: It was the only means to prevent a total dereliction of the &s;ervice. It was a part of their hire; I may be allowed to &s;ay, it was the price of their blood, and of your independency; it is there|fore more than a common debt; it is a debt of honour; it can ne|ver be con&s;idered as a pen&s;ion, or gratuity, nor cancelled until it is fairly di&s;charged.</P>
<P>With regard to the di&s;tinction between officers and &s;oldiers, it

In &s;ome lines, the &s;ol|diers have perhaps generally had as ample compen&s;ation for their &s;ervices, by the large bounties which have been paid them, as their officers will receive in the propo&s;ed commutation; in o|thers, if, be&s;ides the donation

promi&s;ed to the officers of the army.</P>
<P>Before I conclude the &s;ubject of public ju&s;tice, I cannot omit to mention obligations this country is under to that meritorious cla&s;s of veterans, the non-commi&s;&s;ion|ed officers and privates, who have been di&s;charged for inability, in con&s;equence of the re&s;olution of Congre&s;s, of the 23d of April, 1782, on an annual pen&s;ion for life: their peculiar &s;ufferings, their &s;ingular merits, and claims to that provi&s;ion, need only to be known, to intere&s;t the feelings of huma|nity

in their behalf: nothing but a punctual payment of their an|nual allowance, can re&s;cue them from the mo&s;t complicated mi&s;e|ry; and nothing could be a more melancholy and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;ight, than to behold tho&s;e who have &s;hed their blood, or lo&s;t their limbs in the &s;ervice of their country, without a &s;helter, without a friend, and without the means of obtaining any of the comforts or nece&s;&s;aries of life, compelled to beg their daily bread from door to door. Suffer me to recommend tho&s;e of this de&s;cription, belonging to

your State, to the warme&s;t pa|tronage of our Excellency and your Legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay but a few words on the third topic which was propo&s;ed, and which regards particularly the defence of the Re|public. As there can be little doubt but Congre&s;s will recom|mend a proper peace e&s;tabli&s;h|ment for the United States, in which a due attention will be paid to the importance of placing the militia of the Union. upon a regu|lar and re&s;pectable footing; if this &s;hould be the ca&s;e, I &s;hould beg
<PB N="42" REF="018261_0042_0FA5BCF4880F56D8">
leave to urge the great advantage of it in the &s;tronge&s;t terms.</P>
<P>The militia of this country mu&s;t be con&s;idered as the palladium of our &s;ecurity, and the fir&s;t effec|tual re&s;ort in ca&s;e of ho&s;tility; It is e&s;&s;ential, therefore, that the &s;ame &s;y&s;tem &s;hould pervade the whole; that the formation and di&s;cipline of the militia of the Continent, &s;hould be ab&s;olutely uniform; and that the &s;ame &s;pe|cies of arms, accoutrements, and military apparatus, &s;hould be in|troduced in every part of the United States. No one, who has
<PB N="43" REF="018261_0043_0FA5BCF55D32F5D8">
not learned it from experience, can conceive the difficulty, ex|pence, and confu&s;ion, which re|&s;ult from a contrary &s;y&s;tem, or the vague arrangements which have hitherto prevalied.</P>
<P>If, in treating of political points, a greater latitude than u&s;ual has been taken in the cour&s;e of this addre&s;s, the importance of the cri&s;is, and the magnitude of the objects in di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, mu&s;t be my apology. It is, however, nei|ther my wi&s;h nor expectation, that the preceding ob&s;ervations &s;hould claim any regard, except
<PB N="44" REF="018261_0044_0FA5BCF769DA8210">
&s;o far as they &s;hall appear to be dictated by a good intention, con|&s;onant to the immutable rules of ju&s;tice; calculated to produce a liberal &s;y&s;tem of policy, and foun|ded on whatever experience may have been acquired by a long and clo&s;e attention to public bu&s;ine&s;s. Here I might &s;peak with more confidence, from my actual ob|&s;ervation; and if it would not &s;well this letter (already too pro|lix) beyond the bounds I had pre&s;cribed my&s;elf, I could de|mon&s;trate to every mind, open to conviction, that in le&s;s time,

and with much le&s;s expence than has been incurred, the war might have been brought to the &s;ame happy conclu&s;ion, if the re&s;ources of the Continent could have been properly called forth; that the di&s;tre&s;&s;es and di&s;appointments which have very often occurred, have, in too many in&s;tances, re|&s;ulted more from a want of ener|gy in the Continental Govern|ment, than a deficiency of means in the particular States: That the inefficacy of mea&s;ures, ari&s;ing from the want of an adequate authority in the &s;upreme power,
<PB N="46" REF="018261_0046_0FA5BCF86DB1B160">
from a partial compliance with the requi&s;itions of Congre&s;s, in &s;ome of the States, and from a failure of punctuality in others, while they tended to damn the zeal of tho&s;e who were more wil|ling to exert them&s;elves, &s;erved al&s;o to accumulate the expences of the war, and to fru&s;trate the be&s;t concerted plans; and that the di&s;couragement occa&s;ioned by the complicated difficulties and embarra&s;&s;ments, in which our affairs were by this means in|volved, would have long ago produced the di&s;&s;olution of any

But while I mention tho&s;e things, which are notorious facts, as the defects of our federal con|&s;titution, particularly in the pro|&s;ecution of a war, I beg it may be under&s;tood, that as I have ever taken a plea&s;ure in gratefully ac|knowledging the a&s;&s;i&s;tance and &s;upport I have derived from every cla&s;s of citizens; &s;o &s;hall I always be happy to do ju&s;tice to the unparalleled exertions of the

<P>I have thus freely di&s;clo&s;ed what I wi&s;hed to make known, before I &s;urrendered up my pub|lic tru&s;t to tho&s;e who committed it to me. The ta&s;k is now ac|compli&s;hed; I now bid adieu to your Excellency, as the Chief Ma|gi&s;trate of your State; at the &s;ame time, I bid a la&s;t farewell to the cares of office, and all the em|ployments of public life.</P>
<P>It remains, then, to be my final and only reque&s;t, that your Excel|lency will communicate the&s;e &s;en|timents

<P>I now make it my earne&s;t pray|er, that God would have you, and the State over which you pre&s;ide, in his holy protection; that he would incline the hearts of the citizens to cultivate a &s;pi|rit of &s;ubordination and obedi|ence
