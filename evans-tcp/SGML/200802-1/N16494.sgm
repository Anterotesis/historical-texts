<HEAD>AN ELECTION SERMON.</HEAD>
<P>I THINK my&s;elf happy that, after reiterated invitations from this honourable Court, I am at length permitted by divine providence, though under peculiar difficulties, and in the decline of life, to appear in this place, and &s;peak on this public occa&s;ion, when the principal officers of government are to be appointed to their &s;everal departments, according to the &s;uffrages of the peo|ple. I will endeavor to give due honor to the ru|lers of the people, while I declare, with &s;implici|ty of heart and hone&s;t freedom, the admonitions which the great Lord of the univer&s;e gives; and offer my be&s;t thoughts as to the general admini&s;|tration of public affairs, and the way to &s;ecure the pro&s;perity and happine&s;s of a nation.</P>
<P>There is a remarkable paragraph in the &s;acred writings, which may be very well accommodated to my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, and merits particular at|tention. You have it in</P>

<BIBL><HI>DEUTERONOMY, IV, 5&mdash;8.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Behold, I have taught you &s;tatutes and judgments, even as the Lord my God commanded me, that ye &s;hould do &s;o in the land whither ye go to po&s;&s;e&s;s it. Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wi&s;|dom and your under&s;tanding in the &s;ight of the nati|ons, who &s;hall hear all the&s;e &s;tatutes, and &s;ay, &s;urely this great nation is a wi&s;e and under&s;tanding peo|ple: for what nation is there &s;o great, which hath God &s;o nigh unto them as the Lord our God is in all things that we call upon him for? and what nation is there &s;o great, which hath &s;tatutes and judgments &s;o righteous as all this law which I &s;et before you this day.</P></Q>
<P>HERE Mo&s;es recommends to I&s;rael the &s;trict ob&s;ervance of all the laws which he had delivered to them by God's command, relating both to their civil polity and religion, as the &s;ure way to rai&s;e their reputation high among all nations as a wi&s;e and under&s;tanding people; becau&s;e no other nation was ble&s;&s;ed with &s;uch excellent nati|onal laws, or the advantage of applying to the oracle of the living God, and praying to him in all difficulties, with a&s;&s;urance that all their reque&s;ts would be an&s;wered.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="021192_0006_0FB2AF43D11F3978">As to every thing excellent in their con&s;titution of government, except what was peculiar to them as a nation &s;eparated to God from the re&s;t of man|kind, the I&s;raelites may be con&s;idered as a pattern to the world in all ages; and from them we may learn what will exalt our character, and what will depre&s;s and bring us to ruin.</P>
<P>Let us therefore look over their con&s;titution and laws, enquire into their practice, and ob&s;erve how their pro&s;perity and fame depended on their &s;trict ob&s;ervance of the divine commands both as to their government and religion.</P>
<P>They had both a civil and military e&s;tabli&s;hment under divine direction, and a complete body of ju|dicial laws drawn up and delivered to them by Mo&s;es in God's name. They had al&s;o a form of religious wor&s;hip, by the &s;ame authority, minute|ly pre&s;cribed, de&s;igned to pre&s;erve among them the knowledge of the great Creator of the Uni|ver&s;e, and teach them to love and &s;erve him; while idolatry prevailed through the re&s;t of the world: and this religion contained not only a public ritual, but a perfect, though very conci&s;e, &s;y&s;tem of morals, comprehended in ten commands, which require the perfection of godline&s;s, benevo|lence, and rectitude of conduct.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="021192_0007_0FB2AF4556447080">When fir&s;t the I&s;raelites came out from the bondage of Egypt, they were a multitude without any other order than what had been kept up, very feebly, under the ancient patriarchal authority. They were &s;uddenly collected into a body under the conduct of Mo&s;es, without any proper nation|al or military regulation. Yet in the &s;hort &s;pace of about three months after they had pa&s;&s;ed the red &s;ea, they were reduced into &s;uch civil and military order, blended together by the advice of Jethro, as was well adapted to their circum&s;tances in the wilderne&s;s while de&s;titute of property. Able men were cho&s;en out of all their tribes, and made cap|tains and rulers of thou&s;ands, hundreds, fifties and tens: and the&s;e commanded them as military of|ficers, and acted as judges in matters of common controver&s;y.</P>
<P>But the great thing wanting was a permanent con&s;titution, which might keep the people peace|able and obedient while in the de&s;ert, and after they had gained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the promi&s;ed land. Therefore, upon the complaint of Mo&s;es that the burden of government was too heavy for him, God commanded him to bring &s;eventy men, cho&s;en from among the elders and officers, and pre&s;ent them at the tabernacle; and there he endued
<PB N="9" REF="021192_0008_0FB2AF4795EBB1C0">
them with the &s;ame &s;pirit which was in Mo&s;es, that they might bear the burden with him. Thus a Senate was evidently con&s;tituted, as nece&s;&s;ary for the future government of the nation, under a chief commander. And as to the choice of this Senate, doubtle&s;s the people were con&s;ulted, who appear to have had a voice in all public affairs from time to time, the whole congregation being called together on all important occa&s;ions: the government therefore was a proper republic.</P>
<P>And be&s;ide this general e&s;tabli&s;hment, every tribe had elders and a prince according to the patriar|chal order, with which Mo&s;es did not interfere; and the&s;e had an acknowledged right to meet and con&s;ult together, and with the con&s;ent of the con|gregation do whatever was nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve good order, and promote the common intere&s;t of the tribe. So that the government of each tribe was very &s;imilar to the general government. There was a Pre&s;ident and Senate at the head of each, and the people a&s;&s;embled and gave their voice in all great matters: for in tho&s;e ages the people in all republics were entirely unacquainted with the way of appointing delegates to act for them, which is a very excellent modern improvement in the management of republics.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="021192_0009_0FB2AF49124BF5C0">Moreover, to compleat the e&s;tabli&s;hment of civil government, courts were to be appointed in eve|ry walled city, after their &s;ettlement in Canaan, and elders mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed for wi&s;dom and inte|grity were to be made judges, ready always to &s;it and decide the common controver&s;ies within their re&s;pective juri&s;dictions. The people had a right likewi&s;e to appoint &s;uch other officers as they might think nece&s;&s;ary for the more effectual execu|tion of ju&s;tice, according to that order given in DEUT. 16.18, 19.&mdash;<Q>Judges and officers &s;halt thou make thee in all thy gates which the Lord thy God giveth thee throughout thy tribes; and they &s;hall judge the people with ju&s;t judgment: thou &s;halt not wre&s;t judgment; thou &s;halt not re&s;pect per&s;ons, neither take a gift; for a gift doth blind the eyes of the wi&s;e, and pervert the words of the righteous.</Q>&mdash;But from the&s;e courts an appeal was allowed in weighty cau&s;es to higher courts appointed over the whole tribe, and in very great and difficult ca&s;es to the &s;upreme au|thority of the general Senate and chief magi&s;trate.</P>
<P>A government, thus &s;ettled on republican prin|ciples, required laws; without which it mu&s;t have degenerated immediately into ari&s;tocracy, or ab&s;olute monarchy. But God did not leave a peo|ple, wholly un&s;killed in legi&s;lation, to make laws
<PB N="11" REF="021192_0010_0FB2AF4A8784D9B8">
for them&s;elves: he took this important matter wholly into his own hands, and be&s;ide the moral laws of the two tables, which directed their con|duct as individuals, gave them by Mo&s;es a com|plete code of judicial laws. They were not nume|rous indeed, but conci&s;e and plain, and ea&s;ily appli|cable to almo&s;t every controver&s;y which might a|ri&s;e between man and man, and every criminal ca&s;e which might require the judgment of the court. Of the&s;e &s;ome were peculiarly adapted to their na|tional form, as divided into tribes and families al|ways to be kept di&s;tinct; others were e&s;pecially &s;uited to the peculiar nature of the government as a theocra&s;y, God him&s;elf being eminently their king, and manife&s;ting him&s;elf among them in a vi&s;ible manner, by the cloud of glory in the tabernacle and temple. This was the rea&s;on why bla&s;phemy, and all ob&s;tinate di&s;obedience to his laws, were con&s;i|dered as high trea&s;on, and puni&s;hed with death; e&s;pecially idolatry, as being a crime again&s;t the fundamental principles of the con&s;titution. But far the greater part of the judicial laws were found|ed on the plain immutable principles of rea&s;on, ju&s;|tice, and &s;ocial virtue; &s;uch as are always nece&s;&s;ary for civil &s;ociety. Life and property were well guarded, and puni&s;hments were equitably adapted to the nature of every crime: in particular,
<PB N="12" REF="021192_0011_0FB2AF4DCF5F93D0">
murder &s;tands foremo&s;t among capital crimes, and is defined with &s;uch preci&s;ion, and &s;o clearly di&s;tingui&s;hed from all ca&s;es of accidental and un|de&s;igned killing, that the innocent were in no dan|ger of puni&s;hment, and the guilty could not e&s;|cape. And if we &s;till pay regard to this divine law, which is evidently founded on rea&s;on and ju&s;|tice, the modern di&s;tinction of man&s;laughter mu&s;t be rejected as a popi&s;h invention, contrived and added in times when &s;uper&s;tition reigned and claimed a power above all laws. The&s;e laws were &s;ufficient for a nation which had but little commerce abroad; e&s;pecially as the oracle of Jehovah might be con&s;ulted in all ca&s;es of a very extraordinary nature.</P>
<P>Let us now con&s;ider the national wor&s;hip which God e&s;tabli&s;hed among his people; on which their obedience to the moral law very much depended: for unle&s;s they paid con&s;tant reverence and ho|mage to their God, agreeable to his nature and will, they would &s;oon break loo&s;e from all other obligations to morality.</P>
<P>Now as to their ritual; however contemptible, and even ridiculous, it may &s;eem to men who&s;e ideas are all modern, and who proudly contemn
<PB N="13" REF="021192_0012_0FB2AF5403F025F0">
divine revelation; and notwith&s;tanding it is now abrogated by a far more glorious revelation of grace and truth by Je&s;us Chri&s;t; no religious in|&s;titution could be more perfectly accommodated to tho&s;e early ages of the world, and the &s;ituation of the I&s;raelites in the mid&s;t of idolaters, or better prepare the way for the truth and mercy of the go&s;|pel. In tho&s;e ages the minds of men were not &s;uffi|ciently cultivated to receive that religion which is &s;piritual and &s;imple, detached from &s;en&s;ible objects, and de&s;titute of worldly grandeur. Other nations wor&s;hipped their gods with an endle&s;s variety of &s;uper&s;titious rites, a multitude of co&s;tly &s;acrifices, and all kinds of external pomp, which they fanci|ed would be acceptable to deities to whom they attributed the imperfections and even the wor&s;t vi|ces of men. Their wor&s;hip gratified all the &s;en&s;es, was accommodated to every pa&s;&s;ion and lu&s;t, and indulgent to gro&s;s immoralities; it not only cap|tivated vulgar minds, but bound the greate&s;t he|roes, politicians, and philo&s;ophers, fa&s;t in the chains of &s;uper&s;tition. Therefore it was nece&s;&s;ary that the wor&s;hip of the true God &s;hould not be de&s;titute of that &s;plendour which, in tho&s;e ages, &s;truck the minds of men with awe and reverence. Without &s;ome magnificence the be&s;t religion would have appeared contemptible in the view of the
<PB N="14" REF="021192_0013_0FB2AF577AC7B2F0">
world; and the I&s;raelites them&s;elves, dazzled with the pageantry of idols, would almo&s;t inevitably have been captivated; as, notwith&s;tanding every guard which could be placed about them, we find the fa&s;hion of the re&s;t of the world had &s;urpri&s;ing power over them. But the ceremonies of wor&s;hip which God commanded his people to ob&s;erve, were not, like tho&s;e of the heathen, inhuman, frantic, ob&s;cene, varied a thou&s;and ways according to the different characters of their gods; no, but by infinite wi&s;dom they were calculated to promote the knowledge of the divine perfections, and obe|dience to the laws of righteou&s;ne&s;s, and give the mo&s;t encouraging hope in the goodne&s;s and mercy of God. The ritual of the I&s;raelites was rational, &s;ober, uniform, plainly intended to exhibit the maje&s;ty, purity, and mercy of the eternal king; to humble men before him under a continual &s;en&s;e of guilt; and to a&s;&s;ure true penitents of free par|don by virtue of the appointed &s;acrifices, which were types of that one &s;acrifice which Chri&s;t has offered for the &s;ins of the world. And to ren|der their wor&s;hip more &s;triking in their own view; and in the eyes of the world, their tabernacle and temple, their prie&s;thood with its ornaments, their &s;olemn a&s;&s;emblies and great fe&s;tivals, were decent
<PB N="15" REF="021192_0014_0FB2AF58CA8BEBB0">
and magnificent beyond every thing &s;een among the nations around.</P>
<P>How unexampled was this quick progre&s;s of the I&s;raelites, from abject &s;lavery, ignorance, and almo&s;t total want of order, to a national e&s;ta|bli&s;hment perfected in all its parts far beyond all other kingdoms and States! from a mere mob, to a well regulated nation, under a government and laws far &s;uperior to what any other nation could boa&s;t!</P>
<P>It was a long time after the law of Mo&s;es was given before the re&s;t of the world knew any thing of government by law. Where kings reigned their will was a law. Where popular governments were formed, the capricious humour of the multi|tude ordered every thing ju&s;t according to pre&s;ent circum&s;tances; or their &s;enators and judges were left to act according to their be&s;t di&s;cretion. It was &s;ix hundred years after Mo&s;es before the Spar|tans, the mo&s;t famous of the Grecian republics, received a very imperfect, and in &s;ome particulars very ab&s;urd code of laws from Lycurgus. After this feeble attempt of legi&s;lation, three hundred years more elap&s;ed before Solon appeared and gave laws to Athens, though a city long famous for
<PB N="16" REF="021192_0015_0FB2AF5A4E8170A0">
arms, arts, eloquence, and philo&s;ophy. And it was about five hundred years from the fir&s;t founding of the celebrated Roman empire, and nearly three hundred years after Solon, before the fir&s;t laws of that empire were imported from Greece in twelve tables, by ten emba&s;&s;adors &s;ent there for that pur|po&s;e. But even when that empire had attained the &s;ummit of glory, and legi&s;lation was carried to great perfection, however well adapted to a government &s;o exten&s;ive and complicate their laws might be, they were far from being worthy to be compared with the laws of I&s;rael, as to the &s;ecurity of life, liberty, property, and public morals: and as to their religion, which was from the beginning in|terwoven with the &s;tate, in&s;tead of receiving any greater perfection from the increa&s;e of knowledge, wealth and power, it only became a more abun|dant congeries of ridiculous and dete&s;table &s;uper|&s;titions. Moreover; when the Roman empire was overwhelmed and de&s;troyed by an inundation of barbarous nations, and many kingdoms were erected in Europe out of its ruins by the conquer|ors, laws were extinct under the feudal &s;y&s;tem; the will of the barons was a law for their va&s;&s;als; and but a few centuries have pa&s;t &s;ince kings be|gan to introduce law into their courts of ju&s;tice.
<PB N="17" REF="021192_0016_0FB2AF5BCAD6CBA8">
And now, though legi&s;lation has been carried to &s;uch perfection in Great Britain, that land of know|ledge and liberty, yet in a political and judicial view the laws of that kingdom may be charged with many great faults, which ought not to be copied: particularly, the tediou&s;ne&s;s, voluminous bulk, intricacy, barbarous language, and uncer|tain operation of many of them as to equity, ought to be avoided by legi&s;lators who wi&s;h for an ea&s;y and &s;peedy cour&s;e of ju&s;tice among a free people. And perhaps our own courts might be &s;o reformed as to prevent ca&s;es of incon&s;iderable value, and ea&s;y deci&s;ion, from ri&s;ing through all the &s;tages of the law. Again&s;t the&s;e imperfecti|ons good provi&s;ion was made in the law of Mo&s;es, and it might be much for our advantage to pay greater attention to that example.</P>
<P>Upon a review of what has been &s;aid, mu&s;t it not appear quite unaccountable, that the I&s;rael|ites &s;hould &s;o &s;peedily attain to &s;uch an height of good policy and legi&s;lation, beyond all other na|tions? Are we not con&s;trained to acknowlege an immediate interpo&s;ition and direction of heaven? Had the unexperienced multitude been left to them&s;elves to draw up a &s;y&s;tem of civil and mili|tary
<PB N="18" REF="021192_0017_0FB2AF5DA5762A08">
government for them&s;elves, it would have been entirely beyond their abilities to comprehend &s;o complicated a &s;ubject; they mu&s;t have commit|ted innumerable mi&s;takes, in attempting to intro|duce and e&s;tabli&s;h it; they would have been in danger of jarring opinions, tumults, and in&s;ur|rections; and probably before the de&s;ign could be effected, di&s;couragement and confu&s;ion would have forced them to &s;urrender into the hands of de&s;poti&s;m. But their God provided every thing nece&s;&s;ary for their happine&s;s, and nothing more was left to their own wi&s;dom than to &s;ubmit to his authority, and adhere &s;trictly to his com|mands: by this, their reputation among the na|tions would have been equal to the excellency of their laws.</P>
<P>But now you may &s;ay,&mdash;Why then were they not univer&s;ally celebrated? Why did not princes and politicians from all parts of the world vi&s;it them, to learn maxims of polity from &s;o well re|gulated a nation? Why did not philo&s;ophers come, and enquire into that &s;y&s;tem of religion and morality which carried virtue to &s;uch an heigth of perfection? Surely a nation, of which all the parts were &s;o firmly cemented, mu&s;t be &s;trong and formidable: a people, who enjoyed the mo&s;t rational liberty, and yet were under the mo&s;t
<PB N="19" REF="021192_0018_0FB2AF5ECBDA58F8">
voluntary and ab&s;olute &s;ubjection to authority, free from all the convul&s;ions and revolutions which frequently ari&s;e from the raging folly of the populace, mu&s;t become famous: a wi&s;e and impartial admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, according to the mo&s;t excellent laws, by which all were kept in perfect &s;ecurity and peace, could not but be admired: and the commerce of a people, who&s;e morals were governed by the be&s;t precepts, who&s;e word might be tru&s;ted, who practi&s;ed no kind of fraud, and who&s;e behaviour was always benevo|lent, &s;ober, prudent, and &s;incere, mu&s;t be highly valued by the world. Whereas on the contrary, the I&s;raelites were often weak, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and ge|nerally de&s;pi&s;ed and hated by all their neighbours. &mdash;The plain an&s;wer to this objection is&mdash;They never adhered in practice either to the principles of their civil polity or religion: but on their practice depended the pro&s;perity and honor of the nation. They received their law from God, but they did not keep it. They neglected their go|vernment, corrupted their religion, and grew di&s;|&s;olute in their morals, and in &s;uch a &s;ituation no nation under heaven can pro&s;per.</P>
<P>Let us view their &s;tate, in the fir&s;t place, under the judges. Tho' the national &s;enate was in&s;titu|ted
<PB N="20" REF="021192_0019_0FB2AF60926C6E40">
for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Mo&s;es as captain-general and judge of the nation, and this was a plain in|timation that in all &s;ucceeding times &s;uch a &s;enate was nece&s;&s;ary for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the &s;upreme ma|gi&s;trate: yet after Jo&s;hua and the elders of his time were dead, it does not appear that they took the lea&s;t care to fill their places. They left all the affairs of the nation to chance, or extraordinary providence, and had no chief commander, except when God in compa&s;&s;ion to them in their troubles rai&s;ed up judges for their deliverance. And as they &s;uffered the general government to drop, we may well think them as carele&s;s of the govern|ment of the particular tribes. In each tribe, as we have ob&s;erved, a government ought to have been kept up &s;imilar to the national authority, by the elders and prince of the tribe. But we find this remark repeatedly made in the book of Judges&mdash; <Q><HI>In tho&s;e days there was no king in I&s;rael, but every man did that which was right in his own eyes</HI></Q>&mdash; that is in plain terms, there was no authority any where, but every man was left to act as he plea&s;ed. No wonder therefore if they were weak in council and war, and expo&s;ed on every &s;ide to the in&s;ults of their neighbours, being unable to unite in their own defence. This neglect of government was wholly inexcu&s;able: for however they might plead,
<PB N="21" REF="021192_0020_0FB2AF6939AB8CC0">
that Mo&s;es, and Jo&s;hua, and the &s;eventy elders, were of God's immediate appointment, and that they had no warrant to fill up their places; they could not but know they had an undoubted right to provide for their own welfare, e&s;pecially when there was &s;o plain an intimation that the &s;ame government was to be continued. If they were at a lo&s;s what to do, they had the greate&s;t Oracle in the world among them, and they ought to have enquired of God, their king, how to proceed and what per&s;ons to choo&s;e. Nay, they were &s;ome times &s;en&s;ible enough of their right to appoint a chief commander, and even to make the command hereditary, as appears by the addre&s;s to Gideon&mdash; <Q><HI>Rule thou over us; both thou, and thy &s;on, and thy &s;on's &s;on al&s;o;</HI></Q>&mdash;by the choice which the She|chemites made of Abimelech to be their king; and by Jephtha's bargain with the Gileadites to be their head and captain, if he fought for them a|gain&s;t the Ammonites. By all this we may plain|ly &s;ee that the general neglect of government is to be charged as the fault of the people.</P>
<P>And now we cannot wonder if courts of ju&s;tice cea&s;ed, when the higher powers of government were wanting. The&s;e courts, which &s;hould have
<PB N="22" REF="021192_0021_0FB2AF6D0B83EBF8">
been continued in every walled city, dwindled way and came to nothing; crimes were un|puni&s;hed, and the mo&s;t abominable vices &s;pread their infection through all ranks. No law was executed to deter men from murders, robberies, rapes, or any other kind of wickedne&s;s. This is evident by the ca&s;e of the Levite who&s;e concu|bine was abu&s;ed to death by the mob of Benjamites at Gibeah: the city in general di&s;covered no di&s;|po&s;ition to do ju&s;tice upon the offenders; there were no judges near, to whom complaint might be made; nay, it &s;eems the whole tribe were rea|dy to abett the crime rather than puni&s;h it; nor was there any authority in the nation to take cog|nizance of the matter; and therefore the Levite was obliged to take a method, &s;hocking to huma|nity, in order to excite the indignation of the other tribes, and bring their forces again&s;t the Benjamites to their de&s;truction.</P>
<P>We have al&s;o good rea&s;on to think the military affairs of the nation were not in a much better &s;tate than the civil. They could not wholly omit the care of their militia, becau&s;e they were continually expo&s;ed to wars in their own defence. It was nece&s;&s;ary to provide officers, and keep up &s;ome degree of di&s;cipline; but they were very defi|cient
<PB N="23" REF="021192_0022_0FB2AF6F52B01A78">
in this re&s;pect, e&s;pecially as to &s;uperior command. In almo&s;t every battle, again&s;t the mo&s;t contemptible of their neighbours, they were un&s;ucce&s;sful; and were ravaged, plundered, and brought under tribute by all in their turns, and delivered only when God mercifully interpo&s;ed by rai&s;ing up a General in an extraordinary way. On an alarm, in&s;tead of forming a regular army, they &s;eem to have ran together &s;uddenly from all quarters, without order, as if to &s;top a conflagrati|on. Such di&s;united undirected force was never able to &s;u&s;tain a heavy attack, but gave every in|vader an ea&s;y victory.</P>
<P>But that which was the main &s;ource of all their di&s;order and mi&s;ery, was&mdash;their neglecting and corrupting that religion which God commanded. As long as tho&s;e elders lived, who were with Jo&s;hua, and had &s;een all the great works of the Lord which he did for I&s;rael, the people adhered to the wor&s;hip of the true God as pre&s;cribed in the law: but when they were dead, the impre&s;&s;ions which had been made by miracles wore off, as is natural; and they grew regardle&s;s of the wor&s;hip of the &s;anctuary, gave &s;cope to their own imagi|nations, and &s;oon made a mixture of all the &s;uper|&s;titions and idolatries of the heathen with the
<PB N="24" REF="021192_0023_0FB2AF70C9C505B8">
wor&s;hip of Jehovah. They kept up no method of religious in&s;truction; and as they grew more and more ignorant, they thought it too inconvenient to travel &s;o often from all parts of the country, to offer &s;acrifices at the tabernacle, though it was very centrally placed at Shiloh, not much more than eighty miles di&s;tant from the remote&s;t towns; but every man cho&s;e to wor&s;hip nearer home: and &s;o they made groves, and built altars for them&s;elves, and &s;oon &s;et up images of Baal, A&s;hteroth, and other genteel deities which their neighbours wor|&s;hipped. By the&s;e idols, however, they pretended to wor&s;hip the true God, and brought &s;acrifices after their own hearts; for they imagined that all kinds of religion came much to the &s;ame thing, and whether preci&s;ely agreeable to the command or not, would be acceptable, if they were &s;incere. Thus Micah made images, and procured a prie&s;t in his own hou&s;e, which the children of Dan after|wards took away, and fixed in their new conquer|ed city, in the northern bounds of Canaan, where this idolatry continued until the ten tribes were carried into captivity; and Joa&s;h, the father of Gideon, had a grove, and an altar of Baal, for his own family; likewi&s;e Gideon him&s;elf, though highly honoured of God in being the deliverer of
<PB N="25" REF="021192_0024_0FB2AF724B5F2DB8">
I&s;rael from the Midianites, made an ephod, which was &s;oon the occa&s;ion of &s;uper&s;titious wor&s;hip, and drew him and the people from attending at the tabernacle.</P>
<P>Now by the foregoing view of the general &s;tate of the nation during the time of the judges, we may plainly &s;ee the rea&s;on why, in&s;tead of ri&s;ing to fame by the perfection of their polity, religion, and morals, their character &s;unk into contempt. But let us &s;ee whether they conducted better after|wards, under their kings.</P>
<P>It was their crime to demand &s;uch a king as was like the kings of other nations, <HI>i. e.</HI> a king with the &s;ame ab&s;olute power, to command all according to his own plea&s;ure. In this view God only was their king, and the head of the nation was only to be his vicegerent. Therefore as they had implicitly rejected the divine government, God gave them a king in his anger; the con&s;equence of which was, the total lo&s;s of their republican form of government, and &s;ad experience of the ef|fects of de&s;potic power. Indeed their religious e&s;tabli&s;hment, which had been very much impair|ed in the days of the judges, was re&s;tored, and brought to its greate&s;t glory, by David the mo&s;t pious, and Solomon the wi&s;e&s;t of kings; and dur|ing
<PB N="26" REF="021192_0025_0FB2AF74176E98A0">
their reigns, the nation gained the heigth of grandeur; but no national &s;enate was appointed, and the power of the kings continued to be de&s;|potic, and &s;o the days of their pro&s;perity were &s;oon over. As &s;oon as Rehoboam a&s;cended the throne he openly avowed the mo&s;t de&s;potic principles, &s;o that ten tribes revolted, and made Jeroboam their king. Jeroboam, out of policy, to prevent a re|union with Judah by means of the temple wor&s;hip, placed two calves at the extremities of his king|dom, and per&s;uaded the people to wor&s;hip God by them in&s;tead of going to Jeru&s;alem: and this fal&s;e wor&s;hip, together with a multitude of other idolatries introduced by this means, was the religi|on of the ten tribes, until they were captivated by the king of A&s;&s;yria, and di&s;per&s;ed and lo&s;t among the nations. Nor did Rehoboam pay greater re|gard to the law of Mo&s;es; for he built high-pla|ces, and made images and groves on every high hill and under every green tree, and did according to all the abominations of the heathen; and in con&s;equence of this, every kind of vice, and even &s;odomy, prevailed in the land. From this time the propen&s;ity of the people to idolatry increa&s;ed, &s;o that they readily followed the examples of &s;uc|ceeding bad kings, and it became a very difficult ta&s;k for the be&s;t to make an effectual reformation.
<PB N="27" REF="021192_0026_0FB2AF7553C28478">
Nor is it to be wondered at that fal&s;e religion &s;o ea&s;ily gained ground; for the people grew very ignorant: no care was taken to in&s;truct them, in their &s;everal cities, in the law of God; but, being without teachers, they were very little ac|quainted with their own religious in&s;titutions.&mdash; <HI>For this rea&s;on when good king Jeho&s;haphat re|&s;olved upon a reformation in church and &s;tate, after having taken a circuit thro' his kingdom to</HI> <Q>bring the people back to the Lord God of their fa|thers, he &s;ent out &s;ome of his principal officers, with prie&s;ts and levites, to teach the people in the cities of Judah; and the&s;e carried the book of the law with them, and went about throughout all the cities of Judah, and taught them that religion which God commanded by Mo&s;es.</Q> <HI>It likewi&s;e appears by what immediately follows this account of his proceedings, that there had been a long omi&s;&s;ion of the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice in the cities; that no courts had been kept up by preceeding kings, or &s;uch as were corrupt, in which the judges paid little regard to law and equity: for the king</HI> <Q>&s;et judges in the land, throughout all the fenced cities of Judah, city by city, and &s;aid unto the judges, take heed what ye do, for ye judge not for man but for the Lord, who is with you in the judgment:&mdash; wherefore now let the fear of Lord be upon you, take
<PB REF="021192_0027_0FB2AF770B7935C8">
heed and do it, for there is no iniquity with the Lord our God, nor re&s;pect of per&s;ons, nor taking of gifts.</Q> Repeated attempts were made by the few pious kings, to put a &s;top to the corruption of religion and morals; but all in vain; the people relap&s;ed again and again into ignorance, idolatry, and wickedne&s;s: their vices had increa&s;ed to the utmo&s;t degree of enormity in Jeremiah's time; and their complicated crimes at length brought upon them de&s;olation and a long captivity.</P>
<P>And now let us ju&s;t take a glance at their gene|ral &s;tate after the captivity in Babylon. When they returned to their own land they endeavored to conform their religion and government to the mo&s;aic &s;tandard; idolatry was entirely purged out; they di&s;covered great zeal for the law of their God and the in&s;tituted wor&s;hip; they ap|pointed a general &s;enate of &s;eventy elders, called by them the Sanhedrin, with a &s;upreme magi&s;trate at the head, for the government of the nation; and while their pious zeal continued they grew and pro&s;|pered. But, according to the common cour&s;e of things in the world, religion &s;oon degenerated into mere formality, without proper regard to its prin|cipal intention, and became only a &s;hadow of that delivered to their fathers; the affairs of &s;tate were
<PB REF="021192_0028_0FB2AF788E59DFB8">
badly admini&s;tered, and the highe&s;t honors were gained by favor, bribery, or violence; hypo|cri&s;y was &s;ub&s;tituted in the room of the true fear of God, and the practice of righteou&s;ne&s;s; all the vices natural to mankind daily increa&s;ed; and fi|nally they filled up the mea&s;ure of their &s;ins by crucifying the Lord of Glory, and rejecting his go&s;pel, for which they have been made monu|ments of the divine di&s;plea&s;ure unto this day.</P>
<P>Therefore upon the whole view we &s;ee, that the I&s;raelites never attained to that fame and dignity among the nations which their con&s;titution encou|raged them to expect, becau&s;e they took little care to practice agreably to the good &s;tatutes and judg|ments given them by Mo&s;es. Their con&s;titution both of government and religion was excellent in writing, but was never exemplified in fact.</P>

We are now no more at liberty to draw up &s;chemes of religion for our&s;elves, according to our own de|ceitful rea&s;onings and vain imaginations, or to comply with the traditions and commands of men, or fall in with the refinements of human wi&s;dom and the fa&s;hionable &s;entiments of the world, than I&s;rael was to &s;ub&s;titute modes of &s;erving God dif|ferent from what he had expre&s;sly required. We mu&s;t believe what the Son of God, who made the worlds, and was &s;ent by the Father with a proclama|tion of mercy to mankind, has declared to us. He
<PB N="41" REF="021192_0040_0FB2AF983AF7CB70">
died to redeem men from the &s;ervitude of &s;in, and reconcile them to God that they may be rai&s;ed to life eternal; and he is appointed to be like a &s;e|cond Mo&s;es, the captain of our &s;alvation to conduct us to heaven: to him therefore we mu&s;t hearken in all things. The principal doctrines of his go&s;pel are quite &s;imple, plain and important. He teaches us that the commands of God reach to the inward thoughts, principles, and affections of the heart, as well as the outward conduct, and are as pure and perfect as the divine nature;&mdash;that according to the laws of his moral government all men uni|ver&s;ally are &s;inners, and mu&s;t repent in order to obtain mercy;&mdash;that remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins is obtained only by believing on his name, and through his blood &s;hed for us on the cro&s;s;&mdash;that his di&s;ciples mu&s;t receive his word, and obey what&s;oever he hath commanded, endeavoring to be holy in all manner of conver&s;ation and avoid all the vices and corruptions of the world; that there will be a re|&s;urrection from the dead both of the ju&s;t and un|ju&s;t; and a day of &s;olemn judgment, when all man|kind mu&s;t give an account of their conduct in this world, and receive their &s;entence from him whom the Father hath con&s;tituted to be the judge; and that in con&s;equence of their &s;entence mankind will de|part into very oppo&s;ite &s;tates; the wicked into ever|la&s;ting puni&s;hment, and the righteous into life eter|nal,

the pre&s;ent vi&s;ible &s;y&s;tem of nature being then di&s;&s;olved in flames.&mdash;In the belief of the&s;e plain truths, and that wor&s;hip and obedience connected with them, the religion of chri&s;tians con&s;i&s;ts. As to wor&s;hip, no multiplied forms, and punctilious ceremonies are pre&s;cribed, which only &s;erve to throw a veil over the mind; no certain modes are made nece&s;&s;ary; but we mu&s;t wor&s;hip God, who is a &s;pirit, in &s;pirit and in truth, by prayer and prai&s;e, with love and fear, hope and joy. For &s;uch wor&s;hip chri&s;tians are united into &s;ocieties called churches; and are required to a&s;&s;emble every Lord's day, that they may glorify God with one heart and voice, and be in&s;tructed and edified by his word, and the two only ordinances of bapti&s;m and the Lord's &s;upper; which are very &s;imple, but well adapted to the nature and de&s;ign of our religion.</P>
<P>The chri&s;tian religion, therefore, is confined to no particular nation, &s;ect, or denomination; but is de&s;igned to call all men to repentance and new|ne&s;s of life; to encourage their hope in the mercy of God, thro' the only mediator Je&s;us Chri&s;t; per|&s;uade them to the mo&s;t cheerful, per&s;evering obe|dience; and comfort them, under all the labours and &s;orrows of the world, and the natural dread of death, with the a&s;&s;urance of a glorious immor|tality. This religion may be believed and practi&s;|ed,
<PB N="43" REF="021192_0042_0FB2AF9D9E90FF38">
&s;o as to an&s;wer the main purpo&s;es of it, under the various forms in which chri&s;tian churches now appear: ju&s;t as the principal ends of civil govern|ment may be obtained under the various con&s;titu|tions which have taken place in different nations, however one may be much more eligible than a|nother.</P>
<P>Therefore, regard not men who are continu|ally crying up their own &s;ect, and employing their utmo&s;t zeal and art to pro&s;elyte men to their par|ty: they aim to &s;trengthen them&s;elves by your numbers and pur&s;es, more than to &s;ave your &s;ouls. If any &s;ay, lo here is Chri&s;t! or lo there! go not after them: for wherever his word abides, there is Chri&s;t; in and by his word he is already with us, and dwells in the hearts of believers. Li&s;ten to no enthu&s;ia&s;ts, who in&s;tead of enlightening con|found your under&s;tandings; and &s;ub&s;titute folly, non&s;en&s;e, and hypocritical grimace, in the room of a clear manife&s;tation of truth and conformity of heart and life to the go&s;pel. Take heed of imbib|ing the licentious principles of men who affect to render all religion doubtful, by per&s;uading you that every kind of religion is equally acceptable to God if a man is but &s;incere in it; for this renders revelation u&s;ele&s;s. Beware of receiving new opini|ons, which militate with the plain and obvious meaning of the word of Chri&s;t, however they may
<PB REF="021192_0043_0FB2AF9FD460B878">
pretend to be clearer di&s;coveries of truth, and more comfortable and beneficial to mankind: but ad|here to the written word, taken in the mo&s;t natu|ral &s;en&s;e, without forced allegories, whim&s;ical con|&s;tructions, or torturing critici&s;ms; e&s;pecially hold fa&s;t tho&s;e doctrines which meet your eye in almo&s;t every page of the new te&s;tament. Read and me|ditate in the word of God day and night, and di|ligently attend on the public mini&s;trations which Chri&s;t hath appointed in his church; and con&s;ider <HI>that</HI> as a true church where the truth as it is in Je&s;us is preached, and his plain in&s;titutions ob&s;erv|ed, whatever the particular form or denomination may be, avoiding all contentions and uncharitable &s;eparations. Be earne&s;t to procure mini&s;ters, who preach the uncorrupted doctrines of the go&s;pel, in all your towns: let none of your pari&s;hes con|tinue vacant thro' indifference, negligence, or co|vetou&s;ne&s;s; and never withhold from faithful mi|ni&s;ters a comfortable &s;upport. When we look round and &s;ee &s;o many churches de&s;titute of teach|ers, contenting them&s;elves in the total neglect of all divine in&s;titutions, have we not rea&s;on to fear that God is departing from us? And if our reli|gion is given up, all the liberty we boa&s;t of will &s;oon be gone; a profane and wicked people can|not hope for divine ble&s;&s;ings, but it may be ea&s;ily foretold that <HI>'evil will befall them in the latter days.'</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="021192_0044_0FB2AFA0D62A9B38">While I thus earne&s;tly exhort you to religion, it mu&s;t be under&s;tood as equally an exhortation to every branch of morality; for without this all religion is vain.

<P>You will con&s;ider that you a&s;&s;emble from time to time as fathers of the large family, which de|pends on you to take care of its general welfare, and that no local views ought to govern you, nor
<PB REF="021192_0045_0FB2AFA25197E800">
partial in&s;tructions of your con&s;tituents bind you to act contrary to the clear conviction of your own minds. You will be cautious of forming parties for any &s;elfi&s;h purpo&s;es, and of being too ha&s;ty in determining important matters, or too &s;low in your proceedings when bu&s;ine&s;s is urgent. In or|der to form a wi&s;e judgment of every thing that comes before you, you are &s;en&s;ible of the proprie|ty of examining things to the bottom, attending patiently to every argument on both &s;ides, and a&s;k|ing con&s;cience, rather than any friend, what ought to be done. Like frugal hou&s;holders you will &s;ave all unnece&s;&s;ary expences, and take good care of the trea|&s;ury; but not &s;uffer the faithful &s;ervants of the State to be &s;o &s;tinted in their reward as to di&s;cou|rage them from their duty. Lay no grievous bur|dens on the people beyond their abilities; but take the earlie&s;t, ea&s;ie&s;t, and mo&s;t righteous methods to reduce and pay off the public debt, unhappily in|volved in all the perplexities occa&s;ioned by bound|le&s;s emi&s;&s;ions of depreciating paper notes. Be libe|ral, yet frugal, in grants of money, according to the exigencies of the public. Let no laws be want|ing which good order, and the proper admini&s;trati|on of government and ju&s;tice require; but make no law which e&s;tabli&s;heth iniquity. And may I propo&s;e it, as worthy of your con&s;ideration, whe|ther &s;ome reformation may not be nece&s;&s;ary as to
<PB N="47" REF="021192_0046_0FB2AFA3CA574720">
proce&s;&s;es in our courts of ju&s;tice: whether appeals from court to court are not allowed beyond rea&s;on and equity, in the plaine&s;t ca&s;es, and of too trivial value: by which &s;ome of our courts are made mere vehicles, ju&s;tice is delayed, and the law made unne|ce&s;&s;arily expen&s;ive, tedious and vexatious; and whe|ther &s;ome method may not be thought of to deter|mine the judgment of cau&s;es in lower or higher courts in proportion to their value and importance. I beg leave to &s;ay one word as to religion. With re&s;pect to articles of faith or modes of wor&s;hip, ci|vil authority have no right to e&s;tabli&s;h religion. The people ought to choo&s;e their own mini&s;ters, and their own denomination, as our laws now permit them; but as far as religion is connected with the morals of the people, and their improvement in knowledge, it becomes of great importance to the &s;tate; and legi&s;lators may well con&s;ider it as part of their concern for the public welfare, to make provi&s;ion that all the towns may be furni&s;hed with good teachers, that they may be impowered to make valid contracts, and that the fulfilment of &s;uch contracts &s;hould be &s;ecured again&s;t the fickle hu|mours of men, who are always ready to &s;hift from &s;ect to &s;ect, or make divi&s;ions in pari&s;hes that they may get free from all legal obligations to their mi|ni&s;ters. Perhaps a little addition to the law alrea|dy in force in this &s;tate might &s;ufficiently &s;ecure the

continuance of religious in&s;truction, enlarge rather than dimini&s;h liberty of con&s;cience, and prevent envyings, contentions, and crumbling into parties. Will you permit me now to pray in behalf of the people, that all the departments of government may be con&s;tantly filled with the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t men; that his excellency the Pre&s;ident may have the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of an able and faithful Council; that the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice may be in the hands of judges and ju&s;tices well qualified for their offi|ces, who will not take bribes, or in any manner per|vert judgment; in a word, that the con&s;titution e&s;tabli&s;hed may in every re&s;pect be well &s;upported by your care, and that the people may know the ble&s;&s;ings of good government by the union of your coun&s;els, and the wi&s;dom of your proceedings.&mdash; May the Almighty King of kings always be in the mid&s;t of you, direct and a&s;&s;i&s;t you, impre&s;s your hearts with his fear, and grant pre&s;ent and future ble&s;&s;ings in reward of your fidelity.</P>
<P>And now if I have delivered words of truth, a|greeably to my text; and pointed out the &s;ure way to be a pro&s;perous and happy people; may the&s;e things &s;ink deep into your hearts, and be accompa|nied with the divine ble&s;&s;ing! May the general go|vernment of the&s;e United States, when e&s;tabli&s;hed, appear to be the be&s;t which the nations have yet known, and be exalted by uncorrupted religion and morals! And may the everla&s;ting go&s;pel diffu&s;e its Heavenly light, and &s;pread Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Liberty, and Peace, thro' the whole world. AMEN.</P>
