<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Day after this Di&s;cour&s;e was delivered, being at a Hou&s;e where I was told it had given great Offence to &s;ome of the Profe&s;&s;ion in Town, I happened to take up a Book, which pre&s;ented to me the following Pa&s;&s;age,
<Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Apology for the Tale of the Tub. <HI>Edit.</HI> 9 <HI>Lond.</HI></NOTE> Had the Author writ a Book to expo&s;e the Abu&s;es in Law, or in Phy&s;ick, he believes the learned Profe&s;&s;ors in either Faculty, would have been &s;o far from re&s;enting it, as to have given him Thanks for his Pains, e&s;pecially if he had made an honourable Re&s;ervation for the true Practice of either Science.</Q>
Now, tho' I did not write de|&s;ignedly <HI>to expo&s;e the Abu&s;es in Phy&s;ick,</HI> yet in what is accidentally hinted on that Subject, I believe it will &s;carcely be denied that I have <HI>made an honourable Re&s;ervation for the true Practice of the Science.</HI> Neither have I &s;o much as pretended to be capable of effecting any one Thing but what I have expre&s;ly acknowledged any other duly qualified Phy&s;ician can do likewi&s;e. To whom then I would de&s;ire to know, can there be given any ju&s;t Cau&s;e of Offence? The An&s;wer mu&s;t be, To none but tho&s;e who are con&s;cious of being Quacks, for a Quack, who did not believe him&s;elf to be one, could not take Offence, becau&s;e he would think him&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of tho&s;e Qualifications that are &s;aid to be nece&s;&s;ary for a Phy&s;ician, and con&s;equently not affected by any Thing &s;aid again&s;t Quackery: Nay, I &s;hould imagine it would be wrong Policy even in one who know him&s;elf to be a Quack to take Offence, for that would be pleading guilty.</P>
<P>HAD I indeed confin'd the Character of a Phy&s;ician to a Graduate, or re&s;tricted the Method of &s;tudying the Science to certain Opportunities, which every one of the Practitioners here may not have enjoy'd, the Ca&s;e would have been different; but whatever may be my Opinion of the&s;e Mat|ters,
<PB N="iv" REF="006617_0003_102952831FEB2480">
I have no where declared it; having only contended in general, that <HI>Phy&s;ick</HI> is a Science founded on ju&s;t and rational Principles, and that the Knowledge of the&s;e Principles are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to qualify a Man for being a &s;afe practical Phy&s;ician. Whoever is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the nece&s;&s;ary Quali|fications, let him come by them which Way he will, and whether he has a <HI>Di|ploma</HI> or not (for it mu&s;t be owned a <HI>Diploma</HI> is often ea&s;ily and unde&s;ervedly obtained) is to all Intents and Purpo&s;es, in the Sen&s;e I have u&s;ed the Term, a duly qualified Phy&s;ician: And whoever has them not, be his Preten&s;ions what they will, is a Quack. 'Tis true, I have hinted, that this Matter is for the mo&s;t Part too &s;lightly examined into, and unqualified Per&s;ons too often tru&s;ted in <HI>America</HI>; but this is &s;o notorious a Truth, that it is almo&s;t in every Body's Mouth; and I never met with a Practitioner in <HI>America,</HI> even a|mong the lowe&s;t Cla&s;s of them I ever convers'd with, but what would freely own it. At pre&s;ent, therefore, &s;eeing there is no ju&s;t Cau&s;e of Offence given, tho' I have been frequently told great Offence has been taken, yet not being certain of it, having only heard it in general without any Names, I mu&s;t &s;up|po&s;e it either a fal&s;e Rumour, or that tho&s;e who are offended, did not hear the Di&s;cour&s;e, and have had a wrong Repre&s;entation of the Matter given them, which they will be convinced of upon &s;eeing the Piece it&s;elf.</P>
<P>BUT as the Manner this Performance came to be u&s;her'd into the World, was &s;omething uncommon in the&s;e Parts, I mu&s;t beg Leave to be a little more particular concerning it.</P>
<P>IT is a Thing very well known, that in all Places &s;et apart for univer|&s;al Education, publick Orations on phy&s;ical Subjects, as well as on any other Branch of natural Knowledge, are exceeding common. Yet in Reality the Di&s;cour&s;e was not originally writ with that View, for I had actually fini&s;hed what I intended for the Publick on the Subject, before I had any Thoughts of delivering it as a publick Oration. But reflecting there was an Academy newly erected here, and finding the Length of the Di&s;cour&s;e would &s;uit &s;uch a De&s;ign, I thought there would be nothing ami&s;s in de&s;iring the Pre&s;ident, if he approv'd of it, to propo&s;e it to the Tru&s;tees, which was accordingly done and agreed to without any Objection, as I was informed both by the Pre&s;ident, and other of the Tru&s;tees. The Novelty of the Thing, however, I under&s;tand, affords Matter of Sneer to <HI>&s;ome few,</HI> who, perhaps, are un|willing to own the true Motives of their Di&s;approbation. But whatever the&s;e may be, I am quite ea&s;y under the Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having meant well.</P>
<P>AS &s;ome late Mi&s;carriages in Inoculation, tho' but very few, had &s;tag|ger'd many People about a Practice, which I was firmly per&s;uaded in my own Mind, was of the mo&s;t &s;alutary Nature, I thought it my Duty to give
<PB N="v" REF="006617_0004_1029528507A686D0">
a State of my Opinion to the Publick, together with the Rea&s;ons of it, in hopes that what had convinced me, might po&s;&s;ibly convince others: Be&s;ides this, I conceived I had &s;omething new and u&s;eful to offer, at lea&s;t Improve|ments on the common Methods of Management: And &s;eeing the&s;e Things re|lated to a Di&s;temper at pre&s;ent in this Place, I cannot think unprejudiced People will judge it un&s;ea&s;onable.</P>
<P>WHAT is inter&s;per&s;ed concerning the Qualifications of a Phy&s;ician, and the Abu&s;es of the Practice of Phy&s;ick, fell naturally in my Way, and are pointed at no particular Per&s;on living, as the Di&s;cour&s;e it&s;elf, which is printed <HI>verbatim</HI> as it was delivered, will plainly &s;how, whatever Mi&s;|repre&s;entations may have been &s;pread to the contrary. If the&s;e Things be true, &s;eeing the Welfare of Mankind is concerned in the Di&s;pute, it could never be wrong to mention them: If any Man thinks them fal&s;e, he has a Right to make it appear, the Pre&s;s is free. For my own Part, I &s;hall al|ways be open to Conviction, and ready to acknowledge my Error in the &s;ame publick Way I have committed it, or to give my Rea&s;ons in Reply, if I &s;hould not be convinced. This I imagine is the fair Way of &s;ettling a Di&s;|pute that &s;o nearly concerns the Publick; for mo&s;t certainly, who is or is not qualified to be entru&s;ted with the Management of the Sick, is a Matter of no &s;mall Importance to every Community. Any other Method of condemning what is &s;aid relating to that Affair, whether by low invidious In&s;inuations, to rai&s;e Clamour and Prejudice again&s;t the Author, which is altogether un|worthy of Gentlemen; or by pretending with an Air of Con&s;equence and &s;u|perior Abilities, it was not worth While to confute it (a very common Pre|tence among weak, conceited Creatures, when they really can &s;ay nothing to the Purpo&s;e) I make no Que&s;tion but every Thing of this Kind would be ea&s;i|ly &s;een through by &s;en&s;ible impartial Men, and attributed to its ju&s;t Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>TO conclude; if the Piece has any Merit, it will find Friends in this Place, I make no doubt, as well as el&s;ewhere; and if two or three People were to take it into their Heads, from a high Notion of their Intere&s;t and In|fluence, that what they &s;hould be plea&s;ed to &s;ay about the Matter, mu&s;t deter|mine its Reception, I fancy they would in the End find them&s;elves mi&s;taken: But on the contrary, if the Piece has no Merit, there is no Occa&s;ion to put it to the Rack, it will &s;oon die of it&s;elf, and be de&s;ervedly neglected and forgotten.</P>

<HEAD>A DISCOURSE ON THE Preparation of the Body for the SMALL-POX, and the Manner of receiving the <HI>Infection,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Much honoured and worthy Gentlemen, Tru&s;tees of this Academy,</HI></P>
<P>HAVING &s;ome Things to offer which I conceive may be of pub|lick Benefit, I thought they could not be more properly addre&s;s'd, than to a Sett of Gentlemen, who were &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the Nece&s;|&s;ity and U&s;efulne&s;s of Academical Learning, as to become, in the mo&s;t generous and di&s;intere&s;ted Manner, the fir&s;t Promoters of it in this Place. In all Places for Education, <HI>Medicine</HI> has been ever accounted one of the mo&s;t u&s;eful Branches of natural Knowledge; and every At|tempt to improve any Part of it, has been always countenanced and en|courag'd by the Friends and Well-wi&s;hers of the liberal Arts. I make no Doubt then but you will favour me with your Attention, while I propo&s;e &s;ome Things to your Con&s;ideration relating to the SMALL-POX, a Di&s;ea&s;e at pre&s;ent in this Place, and which oftentimes proves fatal in every Part of the World where it has hitherto been known. As I have not been us'd to ha|rangue in this publick Manner, I rely entirely on your Candour and Good-nature, to make a proper Allowance for all Defects in Point of Oratory. <HI>Truth,</HI> indeed, &s;tands &s;eldom in Need of any Embelli&s;hments, and often appears to the greate&s;t Advantage when dre&s;s'd in its own native Simplicity; more e&s;pecially the&s;e Sort of Truths which are rather intended to convince the Mind than excite the Pa&s;&s;ions. The Flowers of <HI>Rhetoric</HI> on &s;uch Oc|ca&s;ions, appear, for the mo&s;t Part, only as &s;o many &s;pecious and &s;uperflu|ous Ornaments. I &s;hall endeavour, therefore, to deliver my&s;elf with all the Plainne&s;s and Brevity I am capable, and the Nature of the Subject will admit.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="006617_0006_1029528A0A671218">EVER &s;ince the SMALL-POX appear'd in the World, it has always been accounted a dangerous, and frequently a mortal Di&s;temper: When the Di&s;ea&s;e is violent, it is certainly extremely dangerous in its own Nature, but capable of being rendered much more &s;o by a wrong Management. The <HI>hot Regimen,</HI> which was univer&s;ally practis'd before <HI>Sydenham</HI>'s Time, and by too many &s;ince, has hurried Numbers out of the World, which might have been ea&s;ily &s;av'd by a different Treatment: But every Thing relating to the Management of the Patient thro' the Cour&s;e of the Di&s;tem|per having been &s;o fully handled by others, I propo&s;e not to dwell upon it in the pre&s;ent Di&s;cour&s;e. My principal De&s;ign is, to offer &s;ome Things concerning <HI>the Preparation of the Body,</HI> and <HI>the Manner of receiving the Infection</HI>; which, from any Thing I have yet &s;een, appears to me, never to have been con&s;ider'd with that Attention the Importance of the Subject de&s;erves: This too &s;eems the more nece&s;&s;ary, as there are &s;ome Points re|lating to this Matter, of the utmo&s;t Con&s;equence to the Life and Safety of Numbers of Mankind, concerning which, People are by no Means agreed in their Opinions.</P>
<P>WITHOUT farther Introduction then in treating this Subject, I propo&s;e to ob&s;erve the following Method.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>I &s;hall premi&s;e &s;ome general Things, and enquire a little into the Na|ture of this Di&s;ea&s;e.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>From the&s;e Premi&s;es I &s;hall endeavour to &s;how what State of the Body is be&s;t fitted to receive the Infection, and how it ought to be prepared, as well in tho&s;e who receive it in the natural Way, as in tho&s;e who take it by Inoculation.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>I &s;hall try to di&s;cu&s;s this Que&s;tion,</HI> viz. <HI>Whether it be &s;afe&s;t and mo&s;t eligible to run the Ri&s;que of catching this Di&s;temper without any Precaution in the natural Way; to take the Infection in the natural Way premeditately after due Preparation; or by Inoculation? And,</HI></P>
<P>LASTLY, <HI>I &s;hall conclude with a few Reflections on the whole.</HI></P>
<P>To begin then with the fir&s;t Thing in the Method, which was to <HI>pre|mi&s;e &s;ome general Things, and enquire a little into the Nature of this Di&s;|ea&s;e.</HI> Tho' <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. <HI>Variolorum Antiquitates Graetis erutae.</HI> D. Hahn.</NOTE> &s;ome have taken a good deal of Pains to &s;how, that the SMALL-POX was de&s;cribed by the old <HI>Greek</HI> Phy&s;icians, under the Title of <HI>Carbuncle,</HI> yet I mu&s;t own my&s;elf of the &s;ame Opinion with the learned and judicious <HI>Sydenham,</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Opera Univer&s;a.</HI> Edit. novi&s;&s;. Lugdum Batavor, Pag. 240.</NOTE> that the Places quoted in Proof of it, are mo&s;t un|rea&s;onably wre&s;ted, and that in Reality the SMALL-POX is not to be found de&s;cribed either in <HI>Hippocrates</HI> or <HI>Galen.</HI> Had it exi&s;ted at that Time in the World, he thinks &s;o &s;agacious an Ob&s;erver as <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> would not fail'd to have de&s;cribed it with his u&s;ual Exactne&s;s and Accuracy, &s;o as to
<PB N="9" REF="006617_0007_1029528EDF508290">
leave no room for any Di&s;pute. The <HI>Arabians,</HI> therefore, &s;eem to have been the fir&s;t who have handed us down any authentic Accounts of this Di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems highly probable, as well from Rea&s;on as Ob&s;ervation, that tho&s;e epidemic Di&s;ea&s;es which cannot be accounted for from the manife&s;t Qualities of the Air, (<HI>viz.</HI> Heat and Cold, Moi&s;ture and Dryne&s;s) have their Beginning, Encrea&s;e, Perfection, Declination and Period; and this, perhaps, in a great Mea&s;ure, from the various Exhalations, that according to the different and unknown Alterations happening in the Bowels, or on the Surface of the Earth, taint the Atmo&s;phere with hurtful <HI>Mia&s;mata,</HI> which, tho' they be too &s;ubtile to undergo the Examination of the Sen&s;es, may yet act at certain Conjunctures on the human Frame, and produce particu|lar Di&s;ea&s;es. This, I &s;ay, may be, and very probably is the general Cau&s;e of all epidemic Di&s;ea&s;es which do not depend upon the manife&s;t Qualities of the Air. Now, tho' the <HI>variolous</HI> Contagion, is generally taken from an infected Per&s;on, yet it is plain from Facts that the Di&s;ea&s;e is often epidemic, and that this epidemical Con&s;titution of the Air is &s;ometimes more, and &s;ometimes le&s;s pernicious: Nay, &s;o &s;trongly was the Air of <HI>England</HI> taint|ed with an epidemical Con&s;titution of this Sort for the Space of near three Years (<HI>viz.</HI> in the Years 1667, 1668, and Part of 1669) that great Num|bers during that Sea&s;on, who had already &s;uffered the SMALL-POX, were &s;eized with what Dr. <HI>Sydenham</HI> calls a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Opera Univer&s;a.</HI> Pag. 163, &amp; 164.</NOTE> <HI>Variolous Fever,</HI> from its having every di&s;tingui&s;hing Symptom of that Di&s;temper, the Eruption of Pu&s;tles alone excepted: At the &s;ame Time too, the SMALL-POX was very frequent among tho&s;e who never had the Di&s;temper before. It is very likely that the Fuel for this Di&s;ea&s;e always exi&s;ted in the human Blood, for the <HI>In|dian</HI> Natives of <HI>America,</HI> where the SMALL-POX was never known, be|fore the <HI>Europeans</HI> came among&s;t them, catch it as readily from an in|fected Per&s;on, as any other. Yet it &s;eems very probable the SMALL-POX never appear'd in the World, before a <HI>variolous</HI> epidemical Con&s;titution of the Air called it forth.</P>
<P>BUT it will be more to the pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e to enquire a little into the Nature and Effects of this Di&s;ea&s;e, now it has appear'd, than to examine when, or how it came into the World. Now it appears in every In|&s;tance, that after the Variolous Contagion, whatever Way communicated, is mix'd with the Ma&s;s of Blood of any Per&s;on who never had the Di&s;|ea&s;e, it always produces an inflammatory Fever. And in Proportion to the Violence of the Di&s;ea&s;e, &s;o always are the Symptoms of this conta|gious Fever, in &s;o much that from the&s;e, for the mo&s;t part, a pretty ex|act Progno&s;tic may be form'd, whether the Di&s;ea&s;e will be more or le&s;s
<PB N="10" REF="006617_0008_102952906DB825B8">
dangerous in its I&s;&s;ue. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Aphori&s;m. Hermon. Boerhaav.</HI> Edit. Leyden&s;. quarta. N^o 1384.</NOTE> Blood taken from a Per&s;on in the Beginning of this fir&s;t Stage of the Fever, makes the &s;ame Appearance as in &s;ound Health; but after it has continued three or four Days, it looks inflam'd and &s;izy, exactly like the Blood of a Per&s;on in a <HI>Pleuri&s;y,</HI> or any other inflammatory Di&s;order. So nearly allied are the Symptoms of this con|tagious Fever to that of a &s;imple inflammatory One, that unle&s;s a Phy|&s;ician from other<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Idem. Ibid. N^o 1387.</NOTE> Circum&s;tances had Rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect this Di&s;order, the very be&s;t might be liable to be deceiv'd. All the &s;ucceeding Appearances in the Progre&s;s of the Di&s;order are evidently of the &s;ame Kind. The <HI>Eruption</HI> is no other than a Number of &s;mall Inflammations, which, when the Di&s;ea&s;e is moderate, regularly ripen into thick white, or yellow|i&s;h Matter, and form &s;mall <HI>Ab&s;ce&s;&s;es,</HI> from which, however numerous they may be, there is &s;eldom much Danger under due Management. On the other hand, when the Di&s;ea&s;e is violent, the dangerous Appearances are all of the <HI>gangrenous</HI> Kind, ari&s;ing from a <HI>putrid</HI> Di&s;&s;olution of the Blood, which are &s;till the genuine Effects of a higher and more exa&s;perat|ed Degree of the inflammatory Fever. The narrow Limits of this De|&s;ign will not permit me to enter into a more minute Detail of Particulars; but it would be ea&s;y to &s;how, that every threatening and mortal Symptom of this Di&s;ea&s;e proceeds from the Cau&s;es a&s;&s;ign'd. I &s;hall conclude, therefore, what I propos'd to premi&s;e in general concerning this Di&s;ea&s;e, with &s;up|po&s;ing it &s;ufficiently prov'd, that whatever be the more hidden and ab&s;tru&s;e Nature of the Variolous Contagion, when it comes to be mix'd with the Blood of a Per&s;on who never had the SMALL POX, it is po&s;e&s;s'd of a &s;timulating Power, which produces an inflammatory Fever, and that fre|quently of the wor&s;t and mo&s;t dangerous Sort.</P>
<P>I proceed now to the &s;econd Thing propos'd, which was <HI>to endeavour to &s;hew, from the foregoing Premi&s;es, what State of the Body is be&s;t fitted to receive the Infection, and how it ought to be prepar'd, as well in tho&s;e who take it in the natural Way, as in tho&s;e who take it by Inoculation.</HI> In general then, as it appears from what has been offer'd, that the whole Danger of this Di&s;temper proceeds from a high inflammatory Fever, pro|ducing a putrid Di&s;&s;olution of the Blood, that State of the Ve&s;&s;els which is the lea&s;t di&s;pos'd to favour Inflammation, and that State of the Fluids which will be apte&s;t to re&s;i&s;t Putrefaction, mu&s;t certainly be that State of the Body which is be&s;t fitted to receive this Di&s;ea&s;e. Now &s;oft and flexi|ble Ve&s;&s;els, containing a cool and temperate Blood, has been found, by uni|ver&s;al <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Idem. Ibid. N^o 1387.</NOTE> Experience and Ob&s;ervation, to be this State. Hence it is that old People, who&s;e Ve&s;&s;els are &s;tiff and rigid, are more indanger'd by the SMALL POX, as well as all other inflammatory Di&s;orders, than Young.
<PB N="11" REF="006617_0009_10295293DAC0A5E8">
And hence, likewi&s;e, tho&s;e who&s;e Blood is heated by High-living and &s;trong Liquors, are in great Danger by the &s;ame Di&s;tempers, than tho&s;e who live more temperately. A very &s;mall Attention will ea&s;ily di&s;cover the Rea&s;on of this. Every inflammatory Fever, as well as every topical Inflammation, is attended with an Ob&s;truction in the &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els; and &s;urely the more lax, and moveable the&s;e Ve&s;&s;els are, the more ea&s;ily will the&s;e ob&s;tructed Particles find a Pa&s;&s;age through them. Again, <HI>Putrefac|tion</HI> is always occa&s;ion'd by too much Heat, and animal Heat is generated by the <HI>Attrition</HI> of the circulating Blood, and the Action of the Ve&s;&s;els: Now the more &s;oft, rare, and inela&s;tic the Bodies ingag'd in Attrition are, the le&s;s Heat will be produc'd, <HI>caeteris paribus</HI>: But it appears, by many Experiments, that hot and intemperate Blood is compos'd of much more den&s;e, compacted, and ela&s;tic Parts, than cool and temperate, and the Ve&s;&s;els that contain it are generally more ten&s;e and rigid; therefore a much greater Degree of Heat will be excited, even &s;uppo&s;ing the &s;ame Celerity of Circulation in both. A very moderate Skill in the Doctrine of Attrition, I imagine, is &s;ufficient to di&s;cover the Force of this Rea&s;oning. But be|&s;ides this, cool and temperate Blood would much longer re&s;i&s;t Putrefaction in the &s;ame Degree of Heat and Motion with that of hot and intemperate. For the Blood is compos'd of what we eat and drink, con&s;iderably alter'd indeed by the Action of the animal Organs, yet &s;till retaining a good deal of the Nature of the Food it was form'd from. Now the temperate Blood here &s;poken of, is &s;uch as is chiefly form'd from a cooling, vegetable, or Milk Diet; and the intemperate &s;uch as principally comes from hot, in|flaming, animal Food, with high &s;ea&s;on'd Sauces, diluted perhaps with &s;pirituous Liquors. But Milk, and all Vegetables (a few hot <HI>Anti&s;cor|buticks</HI> excepted) by heat turn <HI>acid,</HI> which is directly oppo&s;ite to <HI>Putrefac|tion,</HI> and re&s;i&s;ts it: Whereas, on the other hand, all animal Food, either Fle&s;h or Fi&s;h, naturally tends to Putrefaction, and &s;tands in no need of the Heat introduc'd by high &s;ea&s;on'd Sauces, or &s;pirituous Liquors, to encrea&s;e and a&s;&s;i&s;t it. On this Account it is that the Fle&s;h of tho&s;e Animals, who live upon other Animals, putrefies a good deal &s;ooner, than the Fle&s;h of tho&s;e who live intirely on Vegetables, in the &s;ame Degree of heat. Nay, mo&s;t of the rapacious Birds of Prey, even while alive, have a foetid Smell. And it is certain, from Experience, that the human Body cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t long on animal Food alone, unle&s;s it be qualified with Salt or Acids, with|out falling into putrid Di&s;orders. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Commentaria in Aphori&s;m.</HI> Edit.

Whoever reflects duly on the&s;e Things will, I imagine, be fully &s;atisfied, that &s;oft and flexible Ve&s;|&s;els, containing a cool and temperate Blood, prepared chiefly from a &s;ub|acid vegetable, or Milk Diet, mu&s;t be in general that State of the Body which is be&s;t fitted to receive an inflammatory Di&s;temper, who&s;e dange|rous Effects is a putrid Di&s;&s;olution of the Blood, which was previou&s;ly &s;hewn to be the Ca&s;e in the SMALL-POX.</P>
<P>BUT I fore&s;ee an Objection which may probably be rai&s;ed again&s;t what has been advanced. It may be a&s;k'd, if this Matter be as it has been &s;tated, how comes it pa&s;s, that &s;ometimes a &s;trong, lu&s;ty, gro&s;s Per&s;on, who takes the SMALL-POX in the natural Way without any Precaution, &s;hall have it very moderately, whil&s;t another, again, of a thin, &s;pare, and &s;eemingly more advantageous Habit, perhaps too, after a careful Preparation, &s;hall have it in a much more violent Manner? It is undeniable Matter of Fact, that there have been In&s;tances, which if they do not come up fully to this Ca&s;e, at lea&s;t come very near it: No body, however, I believe, will alledge that I have not done compleat Ju&s;tice to the Objection; and I con|fe&s;s, at fir&s;t Sight, it looks very plau&s;ible, but I think <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> of a fair and &s;atisfactory An&s;wer: Fir&s;t, then&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> to be remem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters"> that a thin, &s;pare Per&s;on, may have hot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, whil&s;t the &s;ame Fluid in a more corpulent Habit, may be much more cool and temperate. Second|ly; By a careful Preparation, is for the mo&s;t Part meant, an ab&s;temious Diet, with Bleeding and Purging: But I mu&s;t beg Leave to ob&s;erve, that Errors are ea&s;ily committed in pur&s;uing this Cour&s;e. By &s;uch Evacuations, and too ab&s;temious a Diet, the Patient may be render'd too weak to un|dergo &s;o tedious a Di&s;ea&s;e, and by over-purging, the Blood may be ea&s;ily rendered hot, acrid and putre&s;cent, which would be much wor&s;e than no Preparation at all; &s;o that it requires more Skill to judge how far that Re|gimen, and the&s;e Evacuations, are proper in different Con&s;titutions, than is generally imagined: And if the Qualifications of tho&s;e who are often en|tru&s;ted with the Direction of &s;uch Affairs be candidly con&s;idered, there can, I think, little Doubt be made that they are frequently injudiciou&s;ly u&s;ed. But, thirdly; To give the Objection its full Force, let it be granted that &s;ometimes (for the apparent In&s;tances are but rare) the be&s;t prepared Body has the Di&s;ea&s;e wor&s;t, nothing more will follow than that tho&s;e rare In|&s;tances are Exceptions from a general Rule, and it is &s;aid that all general Rules have Exceptions.

<HI>Sydenham,</HI> to whom the World is indebted for almo&s;t all they know, both of the Hi&s;tory and Cure of this Di&s;temper. No Man ever had bet|ter Opportunities of making Ob&s;ervations; no Man ever ob&s;erved with more Accuracy; and it is univer&s;ally allow'd, that no Man ever related his Ob&s;ervations with more Candour. He tells <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Opera Univer&s;a.</HI> Pagin. 141, &amp; alibi &s;par&s;im.</NOTE> us, he ob&s;erv'd in ge|neral, that old People fared wor&s;e under this Di&s;ea&s;e than young, and Men wor&s;e than Women, the latter being naturally of a &s;ofter and laxer Tex|ture: That young Men again, in the Flower of their Youth, who&s;e Blood was heated by free Living, were more in Danger than tho&s;e who had not yet entered into Company: Nay, that the Children of poor People, who live chiefly on a homely vegetable and Milk Diet, generally had this Di&s;ea&s;e more moderately than the Children of rich People, who were us'd to higher Feeding. The&s;e Things, I &s;hould think, are &s;ufficient to e&s;ta|bli&s;h the Truth of what was laid down, and remove the Objection; but perhaps, before what is intended to be &s;aid on &s;ome other Matters relating to the Preparation of the Body, be fini&s;hed, the&s;e In&s;tances on which the Objection is founded, may be made a proper U&s;e of, and accounted for. I go on, therefore, to offer &s;omething farther on that Subject.</P>
<P>Now tho' the State of the Ve&s;&s;els, and Temper of Blood de&s;cribed, be certainly a mo&s;t u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary Part of the Preparation, yet I am humbly of Opinion, &s;omething more may be done; I think too, I have Rea&s;on from what I have experienc'd in Practice, to be of that Opinion: However, I &s;hall explain my&s;elf candidly on this Matter, with as much Per&s;picuity as I can, freely &s;ubmitting it to the Judgment and future Ex|perience of others. It appears to me then, highly probable, that there is a certain Quantity of an infinitely &s;ubtile Matter, which may be called the <HI>variolous Fuel,</HI> equally, intimately and univer&s;ally diffu&s;ed through the Blood of every human Creature, in &s;ome more, in others le&s;s, that lies &s;till and quiet in the Body, never &s;howing it&s;elf in any Manner hitherto di&s;covered, until put in Action by the variolous Contagion, at which Time it is totally expelled in the Cour&s;e of the Di&s;ea&s;e. Fir&s;t, I &s;ay, this variolous Fuel &s;eems to be infinitely &s;ubtile; that is, &s;o &s;ubtile as to evade the Di&s;covery of our Sen&s;es, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the be&s;t Helps yet found; becau&s;e the Blood of a Per&s;on who never had the SMALL-POX, makes the very &s;ame Appearance, and affords the &s;ame Analy&s;is under the &s;tricte&s;t Exami|nation, as the Blood of o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> who had already &s;uffered the Di&s;ea&s;e. Se|condly; It &s;eems to be equally, intimately and univer&s;ally diffu&s;ed thro' the Blood of every human Creature; for we find the Infection may be com|municated at all Parts of the Body equally; and all the different Inhabi|tants of the Globe, <HI>Europeans, A&s;iaticks, Africans,</HI> and <HI>Americans,</HI> have been hitherto found equally &s;u&s;ceptible of the Di&s;ea&s;e. Thirdly; This
<PB N="14" REF="006617_0012_102952A10236DD30">
variolous Fuel, &s;eems in &s;ome to be more, in others le&s;s in Quantity, and very probably different likewi&s;e in Quality, for we &s;ee People of the &s;ame apparent advantageous Habits, very differently affected with the &s;ame In|fection. Nor are there any Marks hitherto di&s;covered by which it can be &s;o much as gue&s;s'd at, whether any Per&s;on has a greater or le&s;s Quantity of this <HI>variolous Fuel</HI> in the Blood, or whether it be of a greater or le&s;s malignant Quality. And this I think would &s;erve to account for the&s;e In|&s;tances in a former Objection, where &s;trong, lu&s;ty, gro&s;s People, &s;ometimes have the Di&s;ea&s;e very moderately, whil&s;t others again of apparently more advantageous Habits, have it with much greater Violence; becau&s;e, if the Quantity of this variolous Fuel in the former be &s;mall, and its Quality be|nign, the Fever and all its con&s;equent Effects upon the Blood will be pro|portionably &s;mall; whereas on the other Hand, &s;hould tho&s;e of more ad|vantageous Habits, have it in greater Quantity, or more malign Quality, tho' the Body would be better prepared to &s;u&s;tain an equal Degree of Fe|ver, yet as this would by no Means be the Ca&s;e, the Danger would be much greater. But fourthly and la&s;tly; this variolous Fuel lies &s;till and quiet in the Body, until it is put in Action by the variolous Contagion, at which Time it is totally expelled in the Cour&s;e of the Di&s;ea&s;e: This is &s;o plain that nothing farther need be offered in Proof of it, than that tho&s;e who have once had the Di&s;temper, let them be never &s;o much expo&s;ed to the Infection afterwards, are not liable to have it a &s;econd Time. Yet whether ever there was a well atte&s;ted In&s;tance of the &s;ame Per&s;on having the Di&s;ea&s;e twice, I &s;hall not take upon me to determine. Suppo&s;ing there was, &s;ome uncommon Accident or Particularity in the Con&s;titution may have prevented the total Expul&s;ion of it the fir&s;t Time. But if there be any &s;uch Thing at all, it happens &s;o exceeding rare, that it ought to be con&s;ider'd as a Kind of Prodigy, and then the An&s;wer is, that tho' uncommon and extraordinary <HI>Phenomena</HI> of Nature appear &s;ometimes, yet it is never thought a good Argument again&s;t rea&s;oning from its u&s;ual Cour&s;e. All the general Appearances then of the SMALL-POX evidently favour this <HI>Hypo|the&s;is,</HI> which is more than can be &s;aid of any other that I know of; but it was not with a View to e&s;tabli&s;h a Piece of <HI>Theory</HI> that it was fir&s;t ad|vanced, I proceed therefore to make the intended U&s;e of it.</P>
<P>IF then there be &s;uch a &s;ubtile Matter in the Blood of all tho&s;e who ne|ver had the SMALL POX, as, from what has been offer'd, appears, at lea&s;t, highly probable, it would certainly be of the greate&s;t Benefit to Mankind to find out a <HI>&s;pecific Medicine,</HI> which would either expel it in|tirely, alter it &s;o as to render it quite innocent, or mitigate its malignant Quality. A Specific po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of the former Virtues would undoubtedly be the mo&s;t de&s;irable; yet a Medicine capable only of mitigating the Malig|nity of the variolous Fuel, would certainly make a noble Preparative for
<PB N="15" REF="006617_0013_102952A7C3E29160">
the Di&s;ea&s;e. It has been the Opinion of very eminent <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Aphor. Boerhaav.</HI> N^o 1390.</NOTE> Phy&s;icians, that a Specific for the SMALL POX ought to be &s;ought for, and may probably be found. <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Idem, Ibid. 1392.</NOTE> <HI>Boerhaave</HI> &s;eems to think (for he &s;peaks with Re&s;erve) that from &s;ome Things he had &s;een perform'd by the U&s;e of &s;ome of the finer, and milder Preparations of <HI>Antimony</HI> and <HI>Mercury</HI> intimately united, it was well worth while to make farther Trials of them, in order to find out a Specific in this Di&s;temper. As for the general <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Idem, Ibid. 1393.</NOTE> Antiphlogi&s;tic Method, by which the &s;ame great Man propo&s;es to check the Di&s;temper in its fir&s;t Stage, and prevent the Eruption of Pu&s;tles, or even after the Pu&s;tles have appear'd, to cure the Inflammation, and &s;top its farther Progre&s;s, I can|not take upon me to &s;ay how far it may be certain or &s;afe to pur&s;ue it, hav|ing never &s;een'd it tried. But <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Idem, Ibid. 1395</NOTE> he a&s;&s;erts, there have been many In&s;tan|ces of its Succe&s;s, while Phy&s;icians not appris'd of the SMALL POX, treat|ed the Symptoms and Eruption in the &s;ame Manner as they would have done any other high inflammatory Fever. The Danger of &s;uch a Method would be, that if it did not &s;ucceed, the large Bleedings nece&s;&s;ary to be us'd, mu&s;t render the Patient &s;o weak, that he would be very apt to &s;ink under the tedious and trying Cour&s;e which he mu&s;t afterwards undergo. This Method, therefore, is not likely to take Place, unle&s;s, by repeated Trials on Criminals condemn'd to Death, it was found certain, and to be depended upon. But the Trial of an ea&s;y operating antimonial and mer|curial Medicine, as a Preparative for receiving the Di&s;ea&s;e can be attended with no Danger. If it does not alter the variolous Fuel, &s;o as to render it perfectly innocent, or expel it intirely, it may perhaps expel it in Part, or mitigate its malignant Quality; and in either Ca&s;e the Advantage would be con&s;iderable. Tho' I cannot take upon me to a&s;&s;ert any Thing po&s;itive|ly on this Matter, yet there can be no Harm in relating what I have ex|perienc'd in this Affair. On every Occa&s;ion, for the Space of twelve Years that I have been call'd upon to prepare People for the SMALL POX, either for receiving it in the natural Way, or by Inoculation (for I have prepar'd many for both) I have con&s;tantly us'd &s;uch a Medicine as has been mention'd, and I can hone&s;tly declare I never &s;aw one &s;o prepar'd, in any con&s;iderable Danger by the Di&s;ea&s;e. One of them indeed that receiv'd the Infection in the natural Way, had the <HI>confluent</HI> Pock, but I attributed that to his having rid near twenty Miles in cold damp Weather the fir&s;t Day of the contagious Fever, being taken unwell in the Morning before he &s;et off. However tho' he was a young Gentleman in the Flower of his Youth, he got very &s;afely over it. This Di&s;ea&s;e is often &s;o ea&s;ily got over without any Precaution, that many People are unwilling to be at much Trouble about preparing for it, &s;o that eight, ten Days, or a Fortnight, has
<PB N="16" REF="006617_0014_102952AAF8B3DE80">
been the longe&s;t Time I have ever been able to per&s;uade any body to &s;et a|part for it, which was too little. For as the variolous Fuel is univer&s;ally diffus'd, in order to obtain the full Efficacy of the Medicine, the whole Ma&s;s of Blood ought to be richly impregnated with it. I met with one In&s;tance, however, which, as it &s;eems a little remarkable, I will take the Liberty to relate. About ten Years ago, in the Family where I lodg'd, there were five Children who had never had the SMALL POX. The elde&s;t was about twelve Years of Age, and the younge&s;t about two. They were all of healthy Con&s;titutions, born of the &s;ame Parents, and liv'd after the &s;ame Manner, eating and drinking together every Day. The SMALL POX came to the Place, and their Mother would not hear of Inoculation. They were kept as much as po&s;&s;ible out of the Way of the Di&s;temper; but at la&s;t the elde&s;t and younge&s;t were both taken with very violent Symptoms, that pre&s;ag'd a high and dangerous Degree of the Di&s;ea&s;e, which indeed they both had, tho' they got over it. This alarm'd the Mother, upon which &s;he de&s;ir'd I would prepare the other three for taking the Infection in the natural Way. I gave them a Fortnight's Preparation in the Man|ner afore&s;aid, and then they came freely into the Room where the others were. Two of them took the Di&s;ea&s;e, yet in the mo&s;t moderate Manner, &s;o as never to lie by an Hour with it. But the third could not catch it at all, notwith&s;tanding he &s;lept in the Bed with his Brothers and Si&s;ters with the SMALL POX upon them. This young Man is now an Apprentice to a Practitioner in this Town, and he tells me he has been frequently among the SMALL POX &s;ince, and goes at this Time, as he has done for &s;ome Time pa&s;t, freely among&s;t them every Day, dre&s;&s;ing inoculated Sores, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> yet never has catch'd it to this Hour. I would not be under&s;tood to offer this as a Demon&s;tration of what has been &s;ugge&s;ted, for I know there are In&s;tances of People having re&s;i&s;ted very &s;trong Degrees of the Infection, who have afterwards taken it on very &s;light Occa&s;ions, and perhaps this Youth may be among&s;t that Number. It is far from my Intention to im|po&s;e by drawing certain Conclu&s;ions from doubtful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">remi&s;es: But after having &s;tated Things fairly, and in the cleare&s;t Manner I could, I leave every Man to judge for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I HAVE purpo&s;ely avoided giving any formal Directions about the Preparation, thinking it &s;ufficient to propo&s;e the general Intentions to be pur&s;ued, which every judicious Phy&s;ician ea&s;ily knows how to exe|cute, and adapt to different Con&s;titutions; for I think none el&s;e ought to be intru&s;ted with a Matter of this Sort. Nor do I mean by &s;uch, all tho&s;e who by the Courte&s;y of <HI>America</HI> are &s;til'd Doctors, becau&s;e it is well known that Surgeons, Apothecaries, Chymi&s;ts, and Druggi&s;ts, or even mere Smatterers in any of the&s;e, are all promi&s;cuou&s;ly call'd by that Title, as well as real Phy&s;icians. I mention this as well to make
<PB N="17" REF="006617_0015_102952AF850412A8">
People a little more careful in examining into the Preten&s;ions of tho&s;e they intru&s;t as Phy&s;icians, for &s;urely it is a mo&s;t important Tru&s;t, as to gain the Method of Preparation propos'd fair play.</P>
<P>HAVING thus fini&s;h'd what I intended on the &s;econd Thing in the Me|thod, I proceed now in order to the third Thing propos'd, which was to <HI>try to di&s;cu&s;s this Que&s;tion,</HI> viz. <HI>Whether it be &s;afe&s;t and mo&s;t eligible to run the Ri&s;que of catching the</HI> SMALL POX <HI>in the natural Way without any Pre|caution, to take the Infection in the natural Way premeditately after due Pre|paration, or by Inoculation</HI>? Now whoever attentively con&s;iders what has been &s;aid concerning the Nature of this Di&s;ea&s;e, and the Advantages of a proper Preparation, mu&s;t, I think, allow that the &s;ame Per&s;on would certainly have the Di&s;ea&s;e much more moderately, while his Body was in that State de&s;cribed as the fitte&s;t, than if he was to have it under the oppo|&s;ite Circum&s;tances. But no one who runs the Ri&s;que of catching the Di&s;|ea&s;e at random can tell but the latter may be his Ca&s;e. Nay it is mo&s;t like|ly to be the Ca&s;e; for the more hot and putre&s;cent the Blood is, the more ten&s;e and active the Ve&s;&s;els are, the apter they will be to imbibe any Thing applied to them. An In&s;tance of this we &s;ee in <HI>acute</HI> Fevers, where that is the State of the Blood and Ve&s;&s;els. Let a Per&s;on in this Condition drink as much as he will, the Moi&s;ture applied to the Ve&s;&s;els of his Mouth and Throat is &s;oon &s;uck'd up, and they quickly again feel parch'd and dry, which evidently &s;hows that this Power of <HI>Ab&s;orption</HI> in the Ve&s;&s;els, by which Power alone it is that any Thing is taken into the Blood, is encrea|&s;ed by that very State of the Body which is mo&s;t unfriendly to the SMALL POX; con&s;equently, a Per&s;on will be apte&s;t to catch the Infection when he is wor&s;t prepared for it. Seeing this is the Ca&s;e then, it mu&s;t certainly be the mo&s;t dangerous and un&s;afe Method to run the Ri&s;que of catching the Di|&s;temper in the natural Way, without any Precaution.</P>
<P>BUT to this &s;ome will reply, Allowing the Matter to be as it has been &s;tated, as there are In&s;tances of &s;ome who never get the Di&s;ea&s;e at all, there is a Po&s;&s;ibility of e&s;caping it entirely; and be&s;ides that, getting a Di&s;temper indu&s;triou&s;ly looks like Pre&s;umption, or a tempting of Provi|dence. The&s;e Things, I am &s;en&s;ible, have con&s;iderable Influence on &s;ome People, but, with Submi&s;&s;ion, they &s;eem to me to have little of any Con|&s;equence in them. For fir&s;t, the In&s;tances of tho&s;e who never have the SMALL-POX at all, in populous Cities, where the Di&s;temper is frequently among the Inhabitants, (for I &s;peak only of &s;uch,) are exceeding rare, at mo&s;t not one in ten Thou&s;and. This Chance then is &s;o &s;mall as &s;carcely to de&s;erve any Con&s;ideration, when the Danger of running the Chance, and the Advantages of the other Method are &s;et in Competition.</P>
<P>But farther, as the Almighty has form'd us rational Beings, he &s;urely intended we &s;hould act on rational Motives; now Certainty is often out of our Reach,
<PB N="18" REF="006617_0016_102952B675C238E8">
and Probabilities are the only rational Motives we have to act upon in mo&s;t Ca&s;es. The Probability therefore of the greate&s;t Safety being &s;o &s;trongly on the Side contended for, there can be no Pre&s;umption in acting agreea|ble to it; otherwi&s;e taking the mo&s;t probable Means for Self-pre&s;ervation, a Principle ingrafted in us by the Author of our Nature, would be acting pre&s;umptuou&s;ly again&s;t him, which is a palpable Ab&s;urdity. The Pre|&s;umption in neglecting the mo&s;t probable Means of Safety, &s;eems ra|ther to lie on the other Side. But, in truth, tho' it be reckoned Pre&s;ump|tion by &s;ome, yet there are many Things of the &s;ame Sort practi&s;ed every Day by the&s;e very People, without any Scruple. Who among&s;t them, for in&s;tance, would he&s;itate to bleed, vomit, or purge, in order to prevent any dangerous Di&s;ea&s;e, which they had but the &s;lighte&s;t Rea&s;on to be ap|prehen&s;ive of? And yet Bleeding, Vomiting and Purging, are all as real Di&s;ea&s;es as the SMALL-POX, while they la&s;t, and &s;uch as have proved mor|tal too, even when they have been indu&s;triou&s;ly brought on: Yet no Body calls this Practice Pre&s;umption, or a tempting of Providence. The Ca&s;e, I think, is exactly the &s;ame with re&s;pect to the voluntary Way of taking the SMALL-POX. A le&s;s Danger is willingly embraced to avoid a greater, not on &s;light Grounds, but with great Probability apprehended. Thus I have endeavour'd to obviate an Objection, which I have known to &s;tick with Numbers of well-meaning but &s;crupulous Minds, and I thought it my Duty to do &s;o in a Di&s;cour&s;e intended for the Publick, tho' perhaps it may have been unnece&s;&s;ary to the Bulk of more intelligent People: But having already &s;hewn that to run the Ri&s;que of catching the SMALL-POX in the natural Way without any Precaution, is by far the mo&s;t un&s;afe Me|thod, I proceed to examine, <HI>Whether it be &s;afe&s;t and mo&s;t eligible to take the Infection premeditately in the natural Way, after due Preparation, or by Inoculation</HI>?</P>
<P>AND fir&s;t it may not be improper to remark, that, after due Pains taken to prepare the Ve&s;&s;els, one cannot be &s;o certain of taking the Infection in the natural Way, as by Inoculation. The Regimen and Medicines would probably render the Ve&s;&s;els not &s;o ready to catch it, which might con&s;ide|rably prolong the Care and Caution nece&s;&s;ary to be u&s;ed before the Affair was over: So that &s;uppo&s;ing both Ways of receiving the Infection equally &s;afe, Inoculation ought to be preferred. But that we may &s;earch into the Bottom of this Matter, let us in the next Place &s;uppo&s;e the Body equally prepared in both Ca&s;es, when the Infection is received, and then the only Difference will be in the Manner of receiving it, which, if I am not much deceived, will appear, on a &s;trict Examination, to be of much more Importance than is generally imagined, and greatly in favour of Ino|culation. As the Contagion in infected Places is always contained in the Air, when it is received in the natural Way, it mu&s;t be taken in by the
<PB N="19" REF="006617_0017_102952BB016EA360">
Ve&s;&s;els of the No&s;e, Mouth, Throat, Lungs, or Stomach, from the Air drawn in by <HI>In&s;piration,</HI> or &s;wallowed down by <HI>Deglutition.</HI> For, tho' the external Skin abounds with bibulous Ve&s;&s;els, yet but little of that is expo|&s;ed; and be&s;ides, their Orifices neither being &s;o open, nor &s;o moi&s;t, are not &s;o fitly di&s;po&s;ed to take in any Thing applied to them in that Man|ner. But the internal Coats of the No&s;e, Mouth, Throat, Air Ve&s;|&s;els of the Lungs and Stomach, are all lined with a lubricating <HI>Mucus,</HI> fit to entangle the infectious <HI>Mia&s;mata,</HI> and the <HI>inhalant</HI> Ve&s;&s;els of the&s;e Parts are always open, and ready to &s;uck up and convey into the Blood whatever is applied to them: So that &s;hould the Contagion in the Air at any Time be &s;trong enough to enter the <HI>inhalant</HI> Ve&s;&s;els of the external Skin, it would certainly enter the Ve&s;&s;els of the&s;e internal Parts at the &s;ame time, as it mu&s;t be applied to them with &s;uch &s;uperior Advantages. Now the peculiar Advantage of Inoculation, I take to be this, that by this Method the Infection is convey'd into the Blood by the external Ve&s;|&s;els alone, and that only from one particular Spot, which may be cho&s;e in any Part of the Body. It may be worth while therefore, to examine in what this peculiar Excellency particularly con&s;i&s;ts.</P>
<P>It is a Thing well known, that the Danger of all inflammatory Di&s;tem|pers almo&s;t wholly depends upon the Nature and Function of the Part where the Inflammation principally fixes. An Inflammation in the Legs or Arms for Example, or any external Part, is not near &s;o dangerous as one in the <HI>Vi&s;cera</HI> of any of the Cavities of the Belly, Brea&s;t, or Brain. When the Inflammation &s;uppurates in the former Ca&s;e, it may always be cured, and often when it gangrenes; but any con&s;iderable Quantity of Matter lodg'd in any of the three Cavities mentioned, almo&s;t always proves mortal, and a Gangrene there is certain Death. Whatever then will be in&s;trumental in determining the Cri&s;is of the inflammatory Fever rais'd by the variolous Contagion, towards the internal and more noble Parts, mu&s;t be hurtful and dangerous; whereas on the other Hand, whatever tends to lead this Cri&s;is outwardly, and to the more remote Parts, mu&s;t be highly advantageous and &s;erviceable. That the Method of receiving the variolous Infection in the natural Way is of the former, and that by Inoculation of the latter Sort, appears to me &s;trongly &s;upported by the following Ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>FIRST, we ob&s;erve, that in other Poi&s;ons which induce an Inflammation or Gangrene, it principally affects tho&s;e Parts where the Poi&s;on fir&s;t enters, whether it be the internal Coats of the No&s;e, Mouth, Throat, Lungs and Stomach, or the external Surface of the Body. Secondly; It has been re|mark'd that the Pu&s;tles round the inoculated Part are generally very thick; nay I have often ob&s;erved the whole Side on which the Inoculation was made, to be much thicker of Pu&s;tles than the other. Thirdly; The Wound it&s;elf, tho' made &s;mall, which would otherwi&s;e heal up in a few
<PB N="20" REF="006617_0018_102952BC8EB89DA0">
Days, often becomes an ill-conditioned Sore, and keeps running in mo&s;t Ca&s;es for the Space of a Month, and in &s;ome a good deal longer. Fourth|ly; I have taken particular Notice, that tho&s;e who take the Di&s;ea&s;e by Ino|culation, even when the Pock is equally numerous upon the Surface of the Body, are not near &s;o &s;ubject to Sore Throats, and the&s;e other Symptoms which &s;how the internal Parts affected, as tho&s;e who take the Infection in the natural Way. From all which it would appear, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> variolous Contagion, which Way &s;oever it enters the Blood, di&s;orders the whole Body, and rai&s;es an inflammatory Fever, yet that it affects tho&s;e Parts it enters at, in a particular Manner, &s;o as to determine the Cri&s;is of the Fe|ver principally that Way. This then, I &s;ay, &s;eems to me to be the pecu|liar Advantage of Inoculation, that it determines the Cri&s;is of the contagious Fever, from the internal and dangerous Parts to the external and le&s;s dan|gerous, which, as has been already &s;hewn, mu&s;t be of the highe&s;t Benefit.</P>
<P>GIVE me Leave to add, as a corroborating Circum&s;tance, that the Effects of the different Ways of taking the Infection as de&s;cribed, will, in my humble Opinion, clearly account for a very remarkable Phenome|non of this Di&s;temper, taken Notice of by <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Opera Univer&s;a.</HI> Pagin. 591, &amp; 592.</NOTE> Dr. <HI>Sydenham,</HI> which hi|therto has never been accounted for, at lea&s;t, that I ever heard of. The Phenomenon is this: That the Danger of the SMALL-POX is entirely to be e&s;timated by the Number and Nature of the Pu&s;tles upon the Face; &s;o that however few and <HI>di&s;tinct</HI> they may be upon the re&s;t of the Body, if they are numerous and <HI>confluent</HI> upon the Face, there is the &s;ame Danger as if the Body was cover'd with the &s;ame Sort: The Ob&s;ervation holds too, <HI>vice ver&s;a.</HI> Now, agreeable to what has been &s;aid, if the variolous In|fection enters chiefly at the Ve&s;&s;els of the No&s;e, Mouth and Throat, which has been &s;hewn to be the Places it is mo&s;t likely to enter at when the Infection is taken in the natural Way, the Cri&s;is of the contagious Fe|ver will be principally determined that Way. But the <HI>Carotid</HI> Arteries and others, which &s;upply tho&s;e Places as well as the Face, &s;end likewi&s;e con&s;i|derable Branches into the Brain, &s;o that a proportionable Part of the &s;ame Sort of inflammatory Particles that con&s;titute the Pu&s;tles on the Face, mu&s;t be lodg'd in the <HI>Membranes</HI> of the Brain; and as they are of a mild and benign Sort or otherwi&s;e, will produce more or le&s;s Danger in the Cour&s;e of the Di&s;ea&s;e. For the Face con&s;ider'd in it&s;elf, is a Place of no Dan|ger, and con&s;equently one would imagine, no &s;uch Progno&s;tic could be taken from it, but when for the Cau&s;es a&s;&s;igned, it comes to give certain Indications of the State of &s;o important a Part as the Brain, the Ca&s;e dif|fers widely, and the Rea&s;on of <HI>Sydenham</HI>'s Ob&s;ervation appears evident.</P>
<P>BUT be&s;ides this, the Advantages de&s;cribed, ari&s;ing from the Manner of
<PB N="21" REF="006617_0019_102952BFD06DC3C8">
receiving the Infection by Inoculation, are confirm'd by Experience; for it is a Thing well known in this Place, that at different Times, while the SMALL-POX was very mortal among tho&s;e who took the Infection in the natural Way, great Numbers were inoculated, a careful Preparation being little practi&s;ed, yet few, very few indeed, mi&s;carried. Nor can this vari|ous Succe&s;s be a&s;cribed to the Care taken in communicating the Infection from a Pock of a good Kind by Inoculation; for we &s;ee frequent In&s;tances of tho&s;e, who live in the Hou&s;e where the SMALL-POX of the wor&s;t Kind is, having, notwith&s;tanding, the Di&s;ea&s;e mild and moderate; whil&s;t others again, who never had been near any in the confluent Sort, yet have it in the mo&s;t violent Manner: Nay, &s;ome who have been inoculated from a Pock of the be&s;t Kind, have neverthele&s;s had the wor&s;t. So that tho' it be a Practice to be very careful in getting the Infection from a Pock of a good Kind, and to be &s;ure there is no Harm in it, yet it would &s;eem to be a Matter of &s;mall Importance. If therefore the experienced Succe&s;s of Inoculation can neither be a&s;cribed to the Preparation of the Body, which was but little practi&s;ed, or to that of taking the Infection from a Pock of a good Kind, which appears to be of no Moment, I cannot &s;ee any other po&s;&s;ible Way of accounting for it, but from the different Way of receiving the Infection. I have endeavour'd to do this by Arguments, as I think, drawn from fair Rea&s;on, and ju&s;t Ob&s;ervation; and I hope by this Time it appears &s;ufficiently plain, that it is by far the &s;afe&s;t and mo&s;t eligible Way to take the variolous Infection by Inoculation.</P>
<P>HAVING thus fini&s;hed what I intended on the three Heads of the Di&s;|cour&s;e, I come now in the la&s;t Place to make a few Reflections on the whole.</P>
<P>AND fir&s;t, from what was hinted in the Beginning of this Di&s;cour&s;e, that an epidemical Con&s;titution of the Air for producing this Di&s;temper is &s;ome|times more, and &s;ometimes le&s;s pernicious: I &s;hould think the be&s;t Time for getting over this Di&s;ea&s;e would be when it was accidentally brought to a Place, and there was nothing in the Air to favour it at all, or when the <HI>epidemical Pock</HI> was of a good Kind: For the Di&s;ea&s;e is to be &s;uffered but once, and once every one who travels, or is obliged to be often in large Cities where it comes, mu&s;t in all human Probability have it. And the Hi&s;tory of the Di&s;ea&s;e &s;hows, that it is at &s;ome Sea&s;ons much more mortal, than at others. Certainly therefore it will be running the lea&s;t Ri&s;que, to try to get over the threatening Danger at the Sea&s;on abovementioned.</P>
<P>SECONDLY; If tho&s;e Parts the Infection enters at, be of &s;uch Con&s;equence as to determine the Cri&s;is of the contagious Fever principally that Way, it will undoubtedly be be&s;t to convey it at tho&s;e Branches of the <HI>va&s;cular Sy&s;tem</HI> which have the mo&s;t di&s;tant Communication with the Ve&s;&s;els that &s;upply the more noble Parts. For this Rea&s;on, I &s;hould imagine it would be &s;afe&s;t to inoculate in the <HI>lower</HI> Extremities rather than the <HI>upper,</HI> becau&s;e the <HI>axillary</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="006617_0020_102952C16AC1FFC8">
Arteries, which chiefly &s;upply the Arms, come from the <HI>Subclavians,</HI> and they derive their Origin from what is called the a&s;cending Trunk of the <HI>Aorta,</HI> which &s;ends off all tho&s;e Branches which &s;upply the Head, and a great Part of the <HI>Thorax,</HI> where the vital and dangerous Parts are contain|ed. Now, &s;hould the Cri&s;is be principally determined towards the Arm where the Inoculation was performed, the vital Parts will be in more Danger of partaking of it, than if it was determined towards the Legs and Feet, as the Cour&s;e of the Blood in tho&s;e Ve&s;&s;els from whence the lower Extremities are &s;upplied, lead quite a different Way. I know the com|mon Practice is to inoculate in the Arm, and perhaps a Sore in the Feet or Legs may be &s;omewhat more inconvenient; but a Probability of greater Safety, in a Matter where Life it&s;elf is concerned, ought certainly to take Place of a mere Convenience. The&s;e Sores are &s;ometimes extreme|ly trouble&s;ome, and difficult to heal, giving forth a thin, ichorous, cor|roding Matter, which both eats and inflames the adjacent Parts. To pre|vent or remedy this, about three or four Half Drachms of Je&s;uits Bark given at &s;o many Do&s;es through the Day, will, I believe, &s;eldom or never fail to bring good Matter into the Sore, and di&s;po&s;e it to heal. I am &s;en&s;ible this Effect of the Bark in bad Sores, and even in the Pu&s;tles of the SMALL-POX, has been taken Notice of, and made known to the World by the de|&s;ervedly famous <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Medical E&s;&s;ays.</HI> Edinb. Edit. Vol. 5. Part 1&s;t. Art. 10.</NOTE> <HI>Monro,</HI> of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> who&s;e Name, as one of my fir&s;t Ma&s;ters in the healing Art, it is my Duty always to mention with Gratitude and Honour. But having often experienced its good Effects in this particu|lar Ca&s;e, I judg'd there would be nothing ami&s;s in mentioning it by the bye.</P>
<P>But thirdly; From what has been &s;aid concerning this Di&s;ea&s;e, and the Advantages of a well prepared State of Body for receiving it, I think it clearly follows, that it will be much the &s;afe&s;t Method to have the Body put into that State at all Times when the Di&s;ea&s;e is expected, as well in tho&s;e who are determined to wait for it in the natural Cour&s;e of Things, as in tho&s;e who premeditately take the Infection. For tho' the SMALL-POX be frequently got over in a very ea&s;y Manner without any Precaution, yet as it often proves a dangerous and mortal Di&s;temper, too much Care can|not well be taken in a Matter of &s;uch Importance. Inoculation has been &s;hewn to be much the be&s;t and fafe&s;t Way of taking the Infection, yet even in this way it &s;ometimes proves mortal; and indeed, con&s;idering how uncautiou&s;ly and precipitantly this is often done, I am &s;urpris'd it has not been much more frequently the Ca&s;e. Inoculation &s;eems to be con&s;ider'd by many as a mere chirurgical Operation, and accordingly we &s;ee almo&s;t every one who knows how to handle a Lancet intru&s;ted with the whole Management of it: But it has been &s;hewn, that what ought to be done
<PB N="23" REF="006617_0021_102952C360AC3E18">
on this Occa&s;ion for the Safety and Security of the Patient, a judicious and &s;kilful Phy&s;ician only can judge. In Matters of Property and Intere&s;t prudent Men are always cautious and circum&s;pect, in proportion to the Value of the Thing in Danger. Now here, Life it&s;elf, the mo&s;t valua|ble of all earthly Things, is liable to be put in the mo&s;t imminent Danger by Mi&s;management and want of Skill; and yet of all Profe&s;&s;ions in <HI>A|merica,</HI> the true Qualifications of a Phy&s;ician are the lea&s;t examin'd into. This &s;eems &s;omething &s;trange and incon&s;i&s;tent, but the Fact is notorious. It may, perhaps, be occa&s;ion'd, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, by a Notion which prevails even among &s;ome from whom better Things might be expected, that Phy&s;ic is not a <HI>real Science,</HI> founded on ju&s;t and rational Principles, but a Sort of <HI>Knack</HI> to be got intirely by Practice, which an ignorant, il|literate Per&s;on, may as readily attain, as one of Learning and Knowledge, who had taken due Pains to &s;tudy it. If this was the true Notion of Phy|&s;ic, the Di&s;tinction betwixt Phy&s;ician and Quack would be without Foun|dation, for that is in Reality the Principle on which Empirici&s;m is founded. But the able&s;t Phy&s;icians in all Ages have repeatedly confuted it, and prov'd it to be in the highe&s;t Degree &s;en&s;ele&s;s and ab&s;urd. They have bore their publick Te&s;timony again&s;t it, as an injurious Slander on their Profe&s;&s;ion, exceedingly hurtful too in its Con&s;equences to Mankind, as &s;erving for a Cloak to &s;creen Impo&s;tors. In every Country of the known World, where Learning flouri&s;hes, Phy&s;ic is regularly taught as a Science, and &s;tudied as &s;uch by all tho&s;e who qualify for practical Phy&s;icians. But without entering minutely into the Argument, whoever will be at the Trouble of making only a &s;light Examination into this Matter, will &s;oon be convinc'd that the human Body is a <HI>pure Machine,</HI> and that its Di&s;orders are not to be under&s;tood, however often they may be &s;een in Practice, without a particular Knowledge of its Organization and Structure. They would &s;oon confe&s;s with Dr. <HI>Mead,</HI> that "<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mechanical Account of Poi&s;ons.</HI> Fourth Edit.

That &s;ome Things in this <HI>Human Oeconomy</HI> are not thoroughly under&s;tood, may be ea&s;ily granted, and is undoubtedly true; yet nothing follows from the Con|ce&s;&s;ion, but that the Science is not perfect; and I would de&s;ire to know
<PB N="24" REF="006617_0022_102952C6DDB58F70">
what human Science is? Many Things are certainly known concerning it, and he who knows the&s;e Things be&s;t, mu&s;t be be&s;t qualified to judge of Ob&s;ervations in Practice; and he who is ignorant of them, under&s;tands nothing that he &s;ees, and is not qualified for Practice at all. Yet the Mi&s;|chiefs committed by the ignorant Profe&s;&s;ors of Medicine are &s;eldom pub|lickly known, becau&s;e the noxious Things they admini&s;ter work all their Effects in the dark, within the hidden Rece&s;&s;es of the Body, which the greate&s;t Part of Mankind are not qualified to judge of; and therefore are ea&s;ily made believe proceeded not from the injudicious Admini&s;tration, but the Malignity of the Di&s;ea&s;e, or &s;ome other Cau&s;e, which either the Em|piric him&s;elf through Ignorance thinks the true One, or artfully invents to &s;ave his Character. This however is an Unhappine&s;s much ea&s;ier lament|ed than remedied, unle&s;s the Legi&s;lature was to interpo&s;e in Behalf of the Safety of the People, and appoint proper Per&s;ons to judge of the Qualifica|tions of tho&s;e who were permitted to Practice. This, I believe, has been done by all the well regulated Governments of <HI>Europe</HI>; and there is cer|tainly a better Rea&s;on why it &s;hould be done in a young Country, where the Arts and Sciences are but in their Infancy, becau&s;e there the Bulk of the People being more illiterate, are more liable to be impos'd on, as they will be le&s;s capable of detecting Impo&s;tors.</P>
<P>YOU, Gentlemen, have made a laudable Attempt to erect an Academy in this Place for the Advancement of Literature, and the Improvement of the liberal Arts; I heartily wi&s;h your generous Endeavours may be crown'd with Succe&s;s, to the utter Mortification and Di&s;couragement of Impo&s;tors of all Kinds, and the Increa&s;e of true Knowledge, which is the Source of all individual, as well as &s;ocial Happine&s;s.</P>
