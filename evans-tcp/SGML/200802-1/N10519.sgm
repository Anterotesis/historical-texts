<BIBL>1 KINGS, xii. 15.</BIBL>
<Q>Wherefore the King hearkened not unto the people, for the cau&s;e was from the Lord, that he might perform his &s;aying, which the Lord &s;pake by Ahijah the Shilon|ite, unto Jeroboam the &s;on of Nebat.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>SOLOMON, altho' the wi&s;e&s;t of meer men, yet was guilty of much folly, that is, of &s;in and wickedne&s;s, which is emphatically &s;tiled folly in the &s;acred &s;criptures. And e&s;pecially in the matter relating to his wives, concubines, and idolatry, was his &s;in very provoking to the Lord; for we are told Solomon did evil in the &s;ight of the Lord, and the Lord was angry with Solomon. Hence we read that the Lord determined not to let his &s;in go unpuni&s;hed. I Kings xi. 11, 12. <HI>Wherefore the Lord &s;aid unto Solomon, for as much as this is done of thee, and thou ha&s;t not kept my co|venant and my &s;tatutes which I commanded thee, I will &s;urely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy &s;ervant: Notwith&s;tanding, in thy days I will not do it for David, thy father's &s;ake; but I will rend it out of the hand of thy &s;on.</HI> Hence the prophet, by in&s;piration, was ordered to give informati|on thereof to Jeroboam, to whom God determined to give the kingdom, when he &s;hould take it from the &s;on of Solomon. <HI>And Ahijah caught the new garment that was on him, and rent it into twelve pieces; and &s;aid to Jeru|boam, take thee ten pieces: For thus &s;aith the Lord, the God of I&s;rael, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes unto thee.</HI> I Kings, xi. 30, 31. And now, that the purpo&s;e of God, and the prophecy of Ahijah might have their accompli&s;hment, we &s;ee what means the Lord made u&s;e of to bring the &s;ame about, viz. <HI>the corrupt tempers and wicked di&s;po&s;itions of tho&s;e very per&s;ons be determined to correct and puni&s;h.</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="013333_0003_0F9056C96747E498">
It was a puni&s;hment, and a &s;evere correction to Rehoboam to have ten tribes taken from his kingdom: and it was a puni&s;hment, and a &s;evere correction to the ten tribes al&s;o, to be rent off; and therefore it is ex|pre&s;&s;ed that God determined to rend them off, as a cha&s;ti&s;ement for their wickedne&s;s, and e&s;pecially for their &s;in of idolitry, <HI>Becau&s;e that they have for&s;aken me, &s;aith the Lord, and wor&s;hipped A&s;htaroth,</HI> &amp;c. Tho&s;e who are led into &s;in expo&s;e them&s;elves to puni&s;hment, as well as tho&s;e who lead; al|tho' leaders expo&s;e them&s;elves, and merit puni&s;hment to a more aggravated degree. Altho' Solomon led the people to idolatry, yet idolators de&s;erve puni&s;hment, by what means &s;oever they became &s;uch.</P>
<P>And as before hinted, God made u&s;e of the corrupt tempers and wick|ed di&s;po&s;itions of tho&s;e he determined to puni&s;h, to be the very means to bring it about; when Rehoboam was to be made king, the people, with Jeroboam, made a very abrupt demand, and it &s;eems, by the manner of their doing of it, they did not care much whether he an&s;wered it or no: for it &s;eems they had about determined what to do before hand, and &s;o made their demand in &s;uch a manner, all things con&s;idered, that it was not very likely to be granted, but rather likely to iritate the &s;pirits of an ambitious and a&s;piring prince. The demand of the people, in their addre&s;s to Rehoboam was, <HI>Thy father made our yoke grievous; now therefore make the grievous &s;ervice of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us lighter, and we will &s;erve thee.</HI> v. 4 of our context; which &s;eems evidently to car|ry an imply, If you don't, we will revolt. Upon this Rehoboam con|&s;ults with the old men, what an&s;wer he had be&s;t to return the people; and they gave him wi&s;e and good coun&s;el in &s;tate-policy, which, if he had took, and had been conde&s;cending, and gave the people good words that day, as they advi&s;ed him, he might have e&s;tabli&s;hed the kingdom to him|&s;elf, and him&s;elf have been e&s;tabli&s;hed king over the ten tribes. But Re|hoboam was very unwi&s;e, or wi&s;dom was very much hid from the wi&s;e through the prevalency of the corrupt tempers of hisproud and ambitious heart. Therefore he con&s;ults with the young men, brought up with him, and vain like him&s;elf, and he follows their advice, by an&s;wering the peo|ple roughly, &s;aying, <HI>My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke; my fathey al&s;o cha&s;ti&s;ed you with whips, but I will cha&s;ti&s;e you with Scorpi|ons:</HI> v. 14. Here we &s;ee, the people demanded peremptorily, the prince an&s;wered tyrannically, which was the means of their own puni&s;hment, mutually. O! the tremendous wi&s;dom and ju&s;tice of God in his conduct toward ob&s;tinate &s;inners! He can make &s;in its own puni&s;hment, and &s;in|ners their own executioners and tormenters!</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="013333_0003_0F905C96747E498">
Our text informs us, <HI>That the King hearkened not to the people; for the cau&s;e was from the Lord that be might perform his &s;aying, which the Lord &s;pake by Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jereboam the &s;on of Nebat.</HI></P>
<P>In the&s;e words we may note &s;everal things.</P>
<P N="1">1. A purpo&s;e or determination in God, to puni&s;h &s;uch &s;ins in &s;uch a manner, but not a new purpo&s;e none &s;uppo&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. That God had revealed his purpo&s;e and intention by the mouth of the prophet Ahijah.</P>
<P N="3">3. That God does, and will overule things &s;o as that his purpo&s;es &s;hall be brought about. <HI>The king hearkened not to the people, for the cau&s;e was from the Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. That God in his holy providence makes u&s;e of the corruptions and wickedne&s;s of men to bring about his righteous purpo&s;e and decree, and their own puni&s;hment when ever he plea&s;es. For this we are not to &s;up|po&s;e to be a &s;ingular ca&s;e peculiar to Rehoboam and the ten tribes, for God to make u&s;e of their own corrupt tempers, and wicked di&s;po&s;itions, as the means to bring about his purpo&s;e, and their puni&s;hment, but is fre|quently the ca&s;e in other in&s;tances, as we may &s;ee further confirmed in the &s;equel. For the pre|&s;ent, I collect and lay down this doctrine, viz.</P>
<P><HI>The Lord may, and often does, bring about his wife, holy and righteous purpo&s;e or decree, concerning particular events, by making u&s;e of the corrupt tempers, and wicked di&s;po&s;itions of mankind, in order thereunto; and often improves their pre|&s;ent corruptions, as the means to puni&s;h them for former wickedne&s;s.</HI> To illu&s;|trate this doctrine, I &s;hall con&s;ider the following propo&s;itions, viz.</P>
<P>I. That God has a wi&s;e, holy and righteous purpo&s;e or decree, con|cerning all events that ever take place,</P>
<P>II. That in the cour&s;e of providence God often brings about his pur|po&s;e or decree, concerning particular events, by u&s;ing and improving the wicked tempers, and corrupt di&s;po&s;itions of mankind.</P>
<P>III. That God may, and often does, improve the pre&s;ent corruptions of &s;inners, as the means to cha&s;ti&s;e and puni&s;h them for former wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P>I. That God has a wife, holy and righteous purpo&s;e or decree, con|cerning all events that ever take place. Here I &s;hall con&s;ider two things, (I) That God has a purpo&s;e or decree concerning all events that ever take place. (2) That 'tis a wife, holy and righteous purpo&s;e or decree.</P>
<P>(I) That God has a purpo&s;e or decree concerning all events that ever take place. It may be called an eternal purpo&s;e or decree, as God has no new purpo&s;es nor new intentions upon any revolutions or alterations that take place in any part of the created cy&s;tem; which, to &s;uppo&s;e he
<PB N="6" REF="013333_0004_0F9056CA194329C0">
has, would argue mutability and change. And it may be called a pur|po&s;e, or decree, in the &s;ingular number, in reference to the act of God which is one, all one in&s;tantaneous act, and not a number of acts in &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion one after another, as acts and purpo&s;es take place in finite minds; and yet we may call them purpo&s;es and decrees, in the plural number, re|fering to events which are manifold, and the purpo&s;e and decree of God reacheth them all, that no one event cometh to pa&s;s by meer ca&s;ualty and accident, re&s;pecting the Divine Being, or unconnected with the plan of events &s;ettled in the fore-ordination and appointment of God.</P>
<P>I am very &s;en&s;ible that I am fallen upon a point that grates hard on the minds of many: To a&s;&s;ert, <HI>that God, for his own glory, hath fore-ordained what&s;oever comes to pa&s;s,</HI> is looked upon to be a very frightful doctrine, and thought by many to be &s;ufficiently confuted, by only &s;aying, <Q>that if it be &s;o, then God is the author of &s;in, and man is not to blame if he does &s;in.</Q> But if this declaration in our catechi&s;m is duly attended to right|ly under&s;tood and explain'd, it will appear to be agreable, both to &s;crip|ture and rea&s;on, and that there is nothing more frightful in it than the truth, nor does the a&s;&s;ertion make God the author of &s;in, nor man a whit the le&s;s to blame for &s;in, than if there was no decree about it.</P>
<P>Some who deny the doctrine of the divine decrees, will &s;ay, <Q>that God from all eternity fore-knew all events, as certain, which ever take place, altho' he did not fix their certainty by any decree of his.</Q> To this it may be replied, that the fore-knowledge of any future event, as certain, always and nece&s;&s;arily implies that the &s;ame event is certain; becau&s;e in the nature of things, no degree of wi&s;dom, whether finite or infinite, can po&s;&s;ibly know an event to be certain which is not &s;o. And if God did from all eternity fore-know all events as certain that ever do take place, he mu&s;t know upon what foundation they became certain; and if their certainty were not founded in and by his own decree, then it mu&s;t be &s;omething el&s;e that e&s;tabli&s;hed the certainty of events, and God, as an in|finitely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;e &s;pectator, looking on that which he had no hand in, &s;aw the certainty of future events in that which fixed their certainty, and &s;o fore-know all events, and yet not decree them. But I would fain query, what the <HI>something el&s;e</HI> was, which from all eternity, fixed and e&s;tabli&s;hed the certainty of all future events, di&s;tinct from the decree of God him|&s;elf? Was it fate? Was it any nece&s;&s;ity in nature? Or was it the decree of &s;ome other Deity? Or won't it nece&s;&s;arily involve a man in bla&s;phe|my again&s;t the true God, to a&s;&s;ert any po&s;itive cau&s;e, e&s;tabli&s;hing the cer|tainty of all events which from all eternity God &s;aw the certainty of, and at the &s;ame time exclude the decree of God out of the que&s;tion?</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="013333_0004_0F9056CA194329C0">
But that the doctrine of the divine decrees, a&s;&s;erting that God, for his own glory, hath fore-ordained what&s;oever comes to pa&s;s, is no way ab&s;urd, if rightly under&s;tood, and truly explained, I &s;hall here ju&s;t offer a word re&s;pecting two different kinds of events, and remark how we are to un|der&s;tand that they are made certain by the decree of God.</P>
<P N="1">1. The fir&s;t &s;ort of events I &s;hall con&s;ider, is &s;uch as require the divine efficiency to produce them, viz. the creation of the world, the creation of man at fir&s;t, or his new creation in Chri&s;t; the implantation of a princi|ple of holine&s;s in man, after he had lo&s;t it, and the like. Now, if we &s;hould &s;ay, that God from all eternity, fore-knew exactly at what period the&s;e events would take place; 'tis ea&s;y to &s;ee in this ca&s;e, he could not fore-know the events, nor the time preci&s;ely when they would take place, but only in his own eternal and immutable purpo&s;e, to exert his own pow|er, on &s;uch wi&s;e as would infallibly produce tho&s;e effects; and that in &s;uch a period one, and in &s;uch a period another, and herein ab&s;olutely fore-knew the certainty of the event. For the&s;e events could not po&s;&s;i|bly take place but only by the exertion of the divine power to produce them, and therefore could not be known to be cettain, but in knowing the purpo&s;e or decree of God, that in reality he was determined to exert his power &s;o as without fail to bring the event to pa&s;s. But,</P>
<P N="2">2. The other &s;ort of events I &s;hall mention, is &s;uch as are not produced by the divine efficiency, viz. <HI>the &s;in of the creature.</HI> 'Tis a bla&s;phemous doctrine that &s;ome have run into to a&s;&s;ert that God created &s;in, and is the efficient cau&s;e of it, as he is of holine&s;s. God is the efficient cau&s;e of ho|line&s;s, becau&s;e 'tis his own nature, and produced, whenever it is found in any creature, by his own power; but &s;in is the rever&s;e. For &s;imili|tude, The &s;un is the natural, po&s;itive and proper cau&s;e of light and heat, but not &s;o of darkne&s;s and the cold; altho' in point of event darkne&s;s and cold do nece&s;&s;arily take place upon the &s;un's withdrawing. And if the &s;un in his daily and nightly revolutions, was a free and moral agent, and had no other being to controul it, we might &s;ay, he bounded, fixed, and limitted the hours of darkne&s;s, as well as the hours of light, altho' he was not the proper cau&s;e of darkne&s;s as he is of the light. So, God don't &s;uffer the darkne&s;s of &s;in to take place at random, but bounds and limits it by his decree; &s;o as the proud waves of the &s;ea, &s;aying hitherto &s;halt thou come and no further.</P>
<P>But that we may &s;ee how the event is made certain, by the purpo&s;e, or decree of God, re&s;pecting &s;in, we mu&s;t con&s;ider, not only that God don't exert any po&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tive efficacy of his, to produce it: but al&s;o, we mu&s;t con&s;i|der,
<PB N="8" REF="013333_0005_0F9056CAD98B9CA0">
that the decree of God lays no violence upon the freedom of the crea|ture; <HI>but 'tis a determination in God, to &s;uffer or permit the creature to chu&s;e, and act freely, in that which is &s;in, and not interpo&s;e by his own power &s;o as to prevent it; in &s;uch circum&s;tances as he &s;ees the event will certainly take place if he don't.</HI> As for in&s;tance. God, by his infinite under&s;tanding and wi&s;|dom, could not but know, that if he made man, Adam, and placed him ju&s;t as he did, in that &s;tate of trial, Adam would certainly &s;in, in point of event, if God did not interpo&s;e by his divine power and grace, effectually to prevent it; and God determining (for wi&s;e ends) that he would not by his power prevent it, the event became fixed and certain in the divine mind, but the certainty of the event, had no manner of influence upon the mind of the creature in the affair, any more than if the event was not fixed and certain, for man acted ju&s;t the freedom of his own mind, and ju&s;t as he would do, in the &s;ame circum&s;tances, had there been no decree about it, unle&s;s God &s;hould have done otherwi&s;e than he has, viz. prevented &s;in where he has not &s;een fit to prevent it. And &s;o we may &s;ay concerning the &s;ins of other men, as well as the &s;in of Adam, that God perfectly knew, from all eternity, that men under &s;uch and &s;uch temptations as they would in time be under, would certainly &s;in, &s;o and &s;o, ju&s;t as they do, unle&s;s he &s;hould effectually interpo&s;e by his power and grace, and prevent it. But for &s;ome wi&s;e and glorious ends, God determined he would not effectually prevent &s;in, where in reality he now doth not; and &s;o the event became fixed and certain, by the decree of God to permit, or &s;uffer it to take place. And with the ab&s;olute certainty, that tho&s;e events which re|late to &s;in would take place, as well as other events, the divine plan &s;tands connected; which we may &s;ee in an in&s;tance or two I &s;hall mention as a &s;pecimen, viz. Upon the invariable certainty that Adam would &s;in, &s;tands in&s;eperably connected, the &s;cheme of redemption by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, laid in God's eternal coun&s;el of love and peace. Upon the invariable certainty, that Judas, the Jews and the Romans, would be wicked enough, with God's decree of permi&s;&s;ion, to put Chri&s;t to death, &s;tands in&s;eperably con|nected God's eternal purpo&s;e of &s;alvation to &s;inners by Chri&s;t's death. So, that when the event took place, and they by their wickedne&s;s had ac|tually put Chri&s;t to death, the coun&s;el of God was not fru&s;trated, but ful|filled, as faith the apo&s;tle, Acts, ii. 23. <HI>Him, being delivered, by the determi|nate coun&s;el, and fore-knowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and &s;lain.</HI> So, upon the invariable certainty that Pharoah would be hardened, and wicked as he was, and injure and oppre&s;s I&s;rael as he did, God told Abraham of it, and the event connected with it, more than
<PB N="9" REF="013333_0005_0F9056CAD98B9CA0">
four hundred years before hand. Gen. xv. 13, 14. But not to enlarge, the &s;cripture is expre&s;s, <HI>that God worketh all things after the coun&s;el of his own will.</HI> Eph. i. 11. And that &s;inful actions, as well as others, are included, &s;ee Acts iv. 27, 28. <HI>Again&s;t thy holy child Je&s;us, whom thou ha&s;t anointed, both Herod and Pontious Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of I&s;rael were gather|ed together, for to do what&s;oever thy hand and thy coun&s;el determined before to be done.</HI> And although there are many devices in the heart of man, yet we are expre&s;ly told, <HI>the coun&s;el of the Lord, that &s;hall &s;tand.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. I am to con&s;ider that the purpo&s;e or decree of God, e&s;tabli&s;hing the certainty of all events that ever take place, is wi&s;e, holy and righteous. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. This might be argued from the infinite perfections of God: The infinite perfections will not admit of any purpo&s;e in the divine mind, but what is wi&s;e, holy and righteous.</P>
<P N="2">2. This might be largely and fully proved, from the &s;cripture; or the the &s;cripture character we have of God, given in his holy word.</P>
<P N="3">3. But what I aim for the pre&s;ent to con&s;ider and offer as proof, is <HI>the divine conduct.</HI> God executes his decrees, and I may &s;ay, explains them, in his Conduct. Many there are, who think it gives a &s;hocking charac|ter of the Divine Being, to &s;ay he hate decreed all events, or to &s;ay that God hath fore-ordained what&s;oever comes to pa&s;s. And yet the&s;e very men think they highly approve the divine conduct; or at lea&s;t they dare not object a word again&s;t it, but will &s;peak much in favour of it. But if the divine conduct is good, wi&s;e, holy and righteous, then an eternal purpo&s;e or decree in God, to do ju&s;t &s;o, mu&s;t be good, wi&s;e, holy and righteous al&s;o. By way of &s;imilitude, for illu&s;tration. Suppo&s;e a man has a &s;ecret purpo&s;e in his heart, which is bad, even to abu&s;e and injure his fellow men; when that purpo&s;e comes to be acted out, the conduct will appear to be very bad al&s;o; and rather more glaringly bad, in the conduct than in the purpo&s;e only. But yet, depraved mortals have often another way of arguing re&s;pecting the Divine Being. They will allow the divine conduct to be good, but an eternal purpo&s;e or decree in God to do ju&s;t &s;o, they hold to be &s;hockingly bad. Hence, nothing &s;eems to &s;et &s;ome people in a greater ruffle than to mention the doctrine of election, fore-ordination or decrees; and hence they will fly therefrom as Mo&s;es fled from his rod when it appear'd like a &s;erpent, but when he took it in his hand, it became a &s;taff. So I &s;ay, if the&s;e men would but venture to come near the&s;e doctrines, with humble enquiry, and take hold of them with a good under&s;tanding of them, they would appear no more frightful, but as a &s;taff of comfort and &s;upport in the hand of faith.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="013333_0006_0F9056CC323921C8">
But that I may improve the divine conduct to illu&s;trate and vindicate the doctrine of the divine decrees, let us con&s;ider the divine conduct in re|ference to &s;uch events which depraved mortals &s;eem mo&s;t aver&s;e to a willingne&s;s to own, are made certain, fixed, and bounded by a decree, viz. &s;uch as the fall of Adam, or the &s;in of his children, the final im|penitency of any, and their eternal damnation. And on the other hand, that a decree from eternity &s;hould engage, that a certain number of the fallen race, cho&s;en by grace, &s;hould, by the go&s;pel, be effectually and &s;a|vingly called; in time, receive the ble&s;&s;ing of regenerating grace, and have &s;alvation therewith in&s;eparably connected. I &s;ay, let us briefly, at this time, but truly and faithfully attend to the &s;cripture account of what the divine conduct is, re&s;pecting the&s;e points.</P>
<P>And we find by the &s;cripture repre&s;entation of the divine conduct, that in fact God did make and place man, Adam, in a &s;tate of trial&mdash;did &s;uffer the temptations to prevail&mdash;did &s;uffer Adam to &s;in, when he knew he would &s;in if he &s;uffered it; and that God does &s;uffer Adam's children to &s;in is manife&s;tly evident; and altho' he re&s;trains them often, and prevents them from acting out all their heart wickedne&s;s, which otherwi&s;e they would, yet we &s;ee much is permitted to take place in the world. And under the light of the go&s;pel God does &s;uffer many to continue in im|penitency and unbelief to the la&s;t, and die under the cur&s;e, and puni&s;hes them with eternal damnation, as they de&s;erve. And on the other hand, we find by &s;cripture repre&s;entation, that 'tis fact that God does ble&s;s the means of grace to &s;ome, for their &s;aving good&mdash;makes the go&s;pel the power of God unto their &s;alvation&mdash;makes them willing in the day of his power&mdash;does extend to them regenerating grace&mdash;does be&s;tow the gift of faith, and thereunto in&s;eperably connects eternal life, and in the final end infallibly be&s;tows it upon them. Now, if the divine conduct in the&s;e things is good and glorious, and mu&s;t be acknowledged by all, to be wi&s;e, holy and righteous, how is it po&s;&s;ible that an eternal pur|po&s;e or decree in the divine mind, to conduct ju&s;t &s;o toward his creatures, &s;hould be otherwi&s;e than good and glorious, and ought to be acknow|ledged by all, to be wi&s;e, holy and righteous. But the divine conduct in the&s;e things is repre&s;ented in the &s;cripture to be good and glorious, wi&s;e, holy and righteous; and for which God ought to be adored and prai&s;ed to all eternity, even in his conduct both toward them who are &s;aved, and them that peri&s;h. Concerning the &s;aved, their language in &s;cripture is, <HI>Not unto us, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory. By grace we are &s;aved. Not by works of righteou&s;ne&s;s which we have done, but according to his mercy he
<PB N="11" REF="013333_0006_0F9056CC323921C8">
hath &s;aved us by the wa&s;hing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Gho&s;t. Not that we loved God, but he loved us. And they &s;ung a new &s;ong, &s;aying thou art worthy to take the book, and open the &s;eals thereof; for thou wa&s;t &s;lain, and ha&s;t redeemed us to God by thy blood&mdash;&s;aying, ble&s;&s;ing and honor, and glory and power be unto him that &s;iteth on the throne, and unto the Lamb forever and ever.</HI> And concerning them that peri&s;h, the &s;cripture language is, <HI>What if God, willing to &s;hew his wrath, and make his power known, endured with all long-&s;uf|fering the ve&s;&s;els of wrath, fitted to de&s;truction. The Judge of all the earth will do right. 'Tis a righteous thing with God, to recompence tribulation to them even when he &s;hall &s;ay, depart, ye cur&s;ed, into everla&s;ting fire. Thou art righte|ous, O Lord, becau&s;e thou judge&s;t thus. Amen, Alleluia.</HI></P>
<P>And thus the eternal purpo&s;e or decree of God may be vindicated by the divine conduct, which is the decree acted out; and &s;eeing the conduct is holy and righteous, which re&s;pects every event, the decree cannot be otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>But before I di&s;mi&s;s this head, I will ju&s;t an&s;wer one objection which is often brought again&s;t the doctrine of an eternal decree fixing the cer|tainty of all events. They &s;ay, "this renders the u&s;e of means wholly needle&s;s." But this objection is full as &s;trong again&s;t the doctrine of God's eternal fore-knowledge of all events as certain, as 'tis again&s;t the de|crees of God; for God's eternal fore-knowledge of the certainty of all events, &s;uppo&s;es that the events will come to pa&s;s ju&s;t &s;o, and according as they are known to be certain. And they might &s;ay as well, this renders means u&s;ele&s;s. But the objection has its foundation in ignorance and in|attention; and if men were won't to talk &s;o, in worldly affairs, they would be looked upon not much &s;hort of ideots. Let us &s;ee this in a fa|miliar repre&s;entation by way of &s;imilitude. Suppo&s;e a very rich and able man has a full purpo&s;e and determination to erect a magnificent building, and to fini&s;h it off to the turning of a key in the &s;pace of a year; and he has carpenters, ma&s;ons and joiners, a competent number, and other work|men under his controul, &s;ufficient to perform the bu&s;ine&s;s; and he has an idea of the building fini&s;hed in his mind before hand, and rejoices in pro&s;pect as tho' already accompli&s;hed; and on the &s;uppo&s;ition 'tis cer|tain that the man won't be di&s;appointed. Now, for one of that man's neighbours to tell him, Friend, you may di&s;mi&s;s all your workmen, and &s;end them about their own bu&s;ine&s;s, for you need not employ one of them in going forward with your building, for the u&s;e of means is needle&s;s, and it will do no good to u&s;e them, for you have got a firm and &s;et|tled purpo&s;e to fini&s;h your building by &s;uch a time, and I am per&s;uaded
<PB N="12" REF="013333_0007_0F9056CC65578260">
you are able to do it, and will not be di&s;appointed, therefore you had as good di&s;mi&s;s all your workmen as not. Now, for a man in this ca&s;e to talk thus, would be to make him&s;elf ridiculous; for every one knows that the more firm a man is re&s;olved to fini&s;h a building in a certain &s;pace time, and the more certain 'tis the man won't be di&s;appointed, the greater nece&s;&s;ity there is to u&s;e the means by which 'tis to be brought about. And indeed, 'tis the man that is not determined to build, that may di&s;|mi&s;s his workmen, and u&s;e no means in order thereto, and not the other. And full as ab&s;urd it is, to talk as many do, that if all things are decreed which ever take place, then there is no nece&s;&s;ity of u&s;ing means, we had as good fling by all duties, as reading, preaching and praying, &amp;c. as not, for, &s;ay they, it won't alter the ca&s;e at all, nor do any good. Whereas to talk &s;o, 'tis a &s;elf-contradiction: for on the doctrine, that all events are decreed, &s;uppo&s;es the u&s;e of means, is one event, that is to take place, and that to be the means of another; and therefore on this plan, means are made as nece&s;&s;ary, as on any other, and more &s;o; <HI>means</HI> and <HI>end</HI> being con|nected together. As for in&s;tance. If God has ordain'd, that faith &s;hall come by hearing, and &s;alvation by faith, is it not nece&s;&s;ary that we both hear, and believe too, in order to maintain a &s;criptural hope of &s;al|vation? But,</P>
<P>II. I proceed to con&s;ider the &s;econd general head or propo&s;ition, viz. That in the cour&s;e of providence God often brings about his purpo&s;e or decree concerning particular events, by u&s;ing and improving the wicked tempers, and corrupt di&s;po&s;itions of mankind in order thereto. I &s;hall mention a few &s;cripture in&s;tances of this nature, briefly.</P>
<P N="1">1. The affair which our text and context relates unto, may be con&s;i|dered as one in&s;tance, as noted before. God determined to rend the king|dom from Rehoboam, that is, the ten tribes; this is the event to take place. But how does God bring it about? why, we &s;ee, that in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of providence, God made u&s;e of their wicked di&s;po&s;itions; there was no conde&s;cention on the &s;ide of the prince, nor any &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion on the &s;ide of the people, but contrary di&s;po&s;itions prevailed, by which means the pre|diction was fulfilled.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another in&s;tance I &s;hall mention is concerning Jo&s;eph: God deter|mined that Jo&s;eph, one of the &s;ons or Jacob, &s;hould be advanced to great honor and dignity in Egypt, and be the ble&s;&s;ed in&s;trument of laying up corn in &s;tore again&s;t the grievous famine. But Jo&s;eph was young, liv'd at a di&s;tance, and had no thoughts of &s;o much as going to Egypt, 'tis pro|bable. But the &s;cripture tells us that God &s;ent him there, and what means
<PB N="13" REF="013333_0007_0F9056CC65578260">
he made u&s;e of in order thereunto, viz. the wicked tempers and evil di&s;|po&s;itions of Jo&s;eph's brethren: <HI>They hated him,</HI> and &s;old him, and did barbarou&s;ly by their brother; <HI>they meant it for evil, but God meant it for good.</HI> God made u&s;e of their wickedne&s;s to be the means bring about his own holy purpo&s;e.</P>
<P N="3">3. When a nation and people have grown ripe for judgments, and the purpo&s;e and determination of God, is to puni&s;h them &s;everely, with the heavy calamity of war, captivity, bondage and &s;lavery, then God is wont to make u&s;e of the corrupt di&s;po&s;itions of &s;ome proud, and a&s;piring mo|march, as Nebuchadnezzer of old, and many others we read of in the bible, to be the in&s;trument, or rod, in the hand of God, to &s;courge a wicked and rebellious nation or people: and altho' &s;uch an one, in one &s;en&s;e, does the will of God, that is, cha&s;ti&s;es and &s;courges a wicked people, an event that God determined, yet, <HI>howbeit they meant not &s;o, nei|ther did their heart think &s;o.</HI> But it was in their heart to gratify their am|bition, avarice and revenge. And therefore, when God has u&s;ed &s;uch rods &s;ufficiently to an&s;wer his purpo&s;e, he has been wont to break them to pieces, or burn them. See how this is repre&s;ented in I&s;aiah x Once more,</P>
<P N="4">4. The merciful purpo&s;e and decree of God was to give his &s;on to die for &s;inners, that by his death, they might have life. But what means did God make u&s;e of to bring this a&s;toni&s;hing event to pa&s;s? Why, the wick|ed di&s;po&s;itions of mankind, excited by Satan, as Judas's covetou&s;ne&s;s, the heart-malice and enmity of the high prie&s;ts, &amp;c. But I need not enlarge, nor multiply in&s;tances, the point being plain. Well may we &s;ay, the Lord is wonderful in coun&s;el, and mighty in working! whenever any have behaved them&s;elves proudly again&s;t him, he hath evidently been a|bove them; when any rebelliou&s;ly refu&s;e to obey his preceptive will, he can make them fulfil his decreetive will, whether they will or no; he can, and will &s;erve him&s;elf, of them that won't &s;erve him.</P>
<P>III. The third thing to be con&s;idered is, The Lord may, and often does improve the pre&s;ent corruptions of &s;inners, as the means to cha&s;ti&s;e and puni&s;h them for former wickedne&s;s. This is an awful and tremen|dous way of being puni&s;hed, yet the righteous Lord often puni&s;hes &s;in|ners on this wi&s;e. We read in the fir&s;t ch. Rom. that God puni&s;hed the Gentile idolators in this manner. That, <HI>when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, but changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image like to corruptible man. Wherefore God al&s;o gave them up to uncleanne&s;s, thro' the lu&s;ts of their own hearts to di&s;honor their own bodies between them&s;elves.</HI> And
<PB N="14" REF="013333_0008_0F9056CD22B832E8">
Further, <HI>Becau&s;e they chang'd the truth of God into a lie, and wor&s;hipped and &s;erved the creature more than the Creator. For this cau&s;e God gave them up to vile affections,</HI> which led them into abominable, and even unnatural actions. And again, <HI>As they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do tho&s;e things which are not convenient.</HI></P>
<P>And after the &s;ame manner we are told that God puni&s;hed the wicked I&s;|raelites, P&s;alm lxxxi. 11, 12. <HI>My people would not be hearken to my voice, and I&s;rael would none of me. So I gave them up unto their own heart's lu&s;ts, and they walked in their own coun&s;els.</HI></P>
<P>So God made u&s;e of the wicked &amp; corrupt di&s;po&s;ition of Pharaoh, to be the means of his puni&s;hment for his former wickedne&s;s, and even to be the means of his de&s;truction. By his former wickedne&s;s he had forfeited di|vine re&s;traints, and God was plea&s;ed to with-hold re&s;training grace from him, and let his own lu&s;ts prove his own ruin. Hence his own wicked heart led him into the &s;ea, and &s;o was the means of his de&s;truction. So God made u&s;e of Haman's corruption, as the means of his de&s;truction. For his proud, ambitious and a&s;piring mind, was the means that brought him to his end, on a high gallows, as recorded in the book of E&s;ther.</P>
<P>Again, in the in&s;tance of Judas: by his great wickedne&s;s, he had for|feited the grace of God, even re&s;training grace; and God determining to puni&s;h him in great &s;everity, with-holds re&s;training grace from him, and leaves him to fall a prey to his pre&s;ent wicked di&s;po&s;ition, as a puni&s;h|ment for his former wickedne&s;s. And his unbelief hurries him to de&s;|peration, and his de&s;peration to the haltar. And even concerning the damned in hell, we may &s;uppo&s;e this to be the ca&s;e with them, that God makes their pre&s;ent wickedne&s;s the means to puni&s;h them for their former wickedne&s;s, that is, their own lu&s;ts of pride and envy, their di&s;pair ha|tred of God, and implacable enmity again&s;t him are their continual tor|mentors.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>IMPROVEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>USE I. If, as we have heard, God brings about his holy and wi&s;e pur|po&s;e or decree concerning many particular events, by u&s;ing and improving the wicked di&s;po&s;itions of mankind in order thereto, and often improves the pre&s;ent corruptions of &s;inners as the means to cha&s;ti&s;e and puni&s;h them for former wickedne&s;s, then we may hence learn what grounds we have to fear that God is now about to &s;courge and cha&s;ti&s;e, in awful &s;everity, our &s;inful nation and land; and as a ju&s;t puni&s;hment for former &s;ins, to make u&s;e of the pre&s;ent corruptions of men to be the means to bring about their own mi&s;ery? How &s;imilar is the circum&s;tance of our nation and
<PB N="15" REF="013333_0008_0F9056CD22B832E8">
land now, to that of Jeroboam and the children of I&s;rael, both with re&s;|pect to ripene&s;s for judgments by former &s;ins, and ripene&s;s in pre&s;ent cor|ruptions and wicked di&s;po&s;itions di&s;covered, to be the means to bring mu|tual ruin upon our own heads, if heaven prevent not.</P>
<P>When people, highly favoured of God, will &s;in again&s;t his goodne&s;s, and merit his wrath, God may &s;ay in judgment, you may &s;in, and bring your own ruin. This was the ca&s;e of Solomon, Rehoboam, and the children of I&s;rael: they &s;inned much again&s;t the goodne&s;s and mercy of the Lord, and therefore it was but ju&s;tice for the Lord to &s;uffer them to &s;in again&s;t them&s;elves, that is, to bring judgments upon them&s;elves by their &s;ins. So, by way of puni&s;hment, God &s;uffered an unrea&s;onable and tyrannical &s;pirit to prevail in Rehoboam, and a licentious and rebellious &s;pirit to pre|vail among the ten tribes; by means of which, they were mutually cha&s;|ti&s;ed, and a train of evils followed; for we are told, there was war be|tween Rehoboam and Jeroboam, all the days of their life, and the evils did not end with their lives neither.</P>
<P>So by way of puni&s;hment God is threatening of us now, &amp; if he &s;hould &s;uffer arbitrary and tyrannical edicts to i&s;&s;ue from the highe&s;t &s;eat of power in our nation, tending to abridge the colonies in America of their natural and con&s;titutional liberties; and the people &s;hould refu&s;e to &s;ub|ject thereto, let the ri&s;que be what it will; and if what is begun of this nature, and has already took place in a degree, &s;hould be &s;uffered to in|crea&s;e, what can we expect but blood &s;hed and ruin? yea, mutual ruin, the ruin of Britain as well as of the colonies? And if this &s;hould be, if this awful event &s;hould take place, we mu&s;t, and we ought, to acknowledge the hand of God therein, and that the hand of God therein is righte|ous, however &s;inful the in&s;truments may be by which it is brought about.</P>
<P>Our text tells us <HI>the King hearkened not to the people, for the cau&s;e was from the Lord.</HI> And if the king of Great-Britain will not hearken to the people in the colonies of America, if he will not hearken to their humble petiti|ons, nor to their particular demands, the cau&s;e is from the Lord; and doubtle&s;s for this cau&s;e, viz. becau&s;e he intends to puni&s;h the nation for national &s;ins; and to make u&s;e of the corruptions of tho&s;e he means to puni&s;h, as the means to bring it about. If a righteous God had not a hand in what this land &s;eems to be threatened with, as well as unrighteous men, we &s;hould have le&s;s cau&s;e to fear. If the great King of Heaven did not threaten to puni&s;h this land, we &s;hould have le&s;s cau&s;e to fear the threats of the king of Great-Britain. And if there is no act pa&s;&s;ed in the court of heaven to puni&s;h us, we might hope, &s;ome how, to evade the acts
<PB N="16" REF="013333_0009_0F9056CE0EE7DB60">
of parliament, pa&s;&s;ed with that de&s;ign. But this, alas! this is what we have rea&s;on to fear, that God is now about to cha&s;ti&s;e, and in great &s;everity, to puni&s;h &s;uch a wicked land and nation as our's is, at this day grown &s;o ripe for ruin. When the wickedne&s;s of the old world was great upon the earth, God &s;ent the deluge and &s;wept them off of the earth; and when the cry of Sodom, who&s;e wickedne&s;s was great, went up to heaven; the Lord who&s;e wrath was hot, rained down fire and brim&s;tone upon them, out of Heaven. And how can we expect to e&s;cape the &s;evere judgments of God, when there is &s;o much of the &s;in of the old world &amp; of Sodom too, to be found in our nation and Land? Britain and America, e&s;pecially this part of America, called New-England, have been eminently favoured by heaven for a greatwhile, but have not made an&s;werable returns, but have requited the Lord with evil for his goodne&s;s. <HI>And will not the Lord vi&s;it for the&s;e things, and be avenged on &s;uch a nation as this?</HI> O! what a deluge of impiety has over&s;pread Britain, at this day &s;o much drench'd in all manner of debaucheries &amp; wickedne&s;s? How doth intemperance, drunk|enne&s;s and &s;en&s;ualities of all kinds prevail? What profanation the day and name of the Lord, and contempt of the go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t? What licencious doctrines and damnable heri&s;ies are imbibed, while the glorious truths of the go&s;pel are rejected? Doth not arminiani&s;m, ariani&s;m, dei&s;m and infidelities of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t kinds prevail? While truth, and the power of godline&s;s is but rarely known, in a comparative &s;en&s;e I mean. There is doubtle&s;s a few at this day, and comparatively but a few, eminent ones, like Lot in Sodom, daily have their <HI>righteous &s;ouls vexed with the evil deeds and conver&s;ation of the wicked while they live among them.</HI> And if we ca&s;t our eyes over the American land, and colonies, and even New-England in particular, once renowned for piety, and purity, and with the apo&s;tle &s;hould a&s;k the que&s;tion, <HI>are we better than they?</HI> mu&s;t we not with him an|&s;wer, <HI>no in no wi&s;e.</HI> Or if in &s;ome branches of impiety, this land has not yet quite equalled her mother country, yet how manife&s;t it is, that as a peo|ple we have been long on the march, and have travelled with the rapid &s;wiftne&s;s, towards as high a pitch of wickedne&s;s as was ever practi&s;ed in our mother country, or any other in the univer&s;e, And the &s;ame &s;ins in this lands, mu&s;t be more henious in the &s;ight of God than in &s;ome other countries, by rea&s;on of our being more highly exalted in point of privileges, &s;piritual privileges e&s;pecially, with re&s;pect to the primitive religion of New England, the glory is departed, the gold is become dim, and the mo&s;t fine gold changed. <HI>Do we thus requite the Lord, O fooli&s;h people and unwi&s;e</HI> Have we not now rea&s;on to expect the frowns of Heaven, &amp; a &s;torm of ven|geance
<PB N="17" REF="013333_0009_0F9056CE0EE7DB60">
to be &s;ent down upon us? And are not the clouds now gathering? And have been for &s;ome time, both thick and dark? And what does this portend but a &s;torm at hand? People now in New-England begin to feel the effects of de&s;potic power, and are alarm'd thereat, but yet entertain hopes to evade the force of it, but whether they can or no, heaven only knows. How vigilant have many been of late, to &s;tudy, a&s;&s;ert and vin|dicate their natural and con&s;titutional liberties and privileges? And what a loud and ju&s;t cry they make again&s;t that power, or claim of power that would abridge them of the &s;ame? And yet among other &s;ins, is not New-England, the government and authrity of &s;ome of the colonies in New-England, guilty of exerci&s;ing the &s;ame arbitrary power, to abridge man, or their natural and con&s;titutional liberties and privileges? One of the natural rights of mankind is, a liberty to choo&s;e, in matters of religion, that way, mode, form and wor&s;hip which a man in his con&s;cience thinks mo&s;t is agreable to the word of God, and mo&s;t acceptable to God. And the con&s;titution of the go&s;pel confirms this natural right unto man, by bidding individuals <HI>&s;earch the &s;criptures,</HI> &amp;c. And the de&s;ign of the ori|ginal con&s;titution of New-England was the &s;ame. For our fore-fathers came into this land, to enjoy and grant liberty of con&s;cience. But now times and things among&s;t us are &s;o altered from their original de|&s;ign in New-England, that if a number in point of con&s;cience, reduce the principles of our fore-fathers in this land into practice, by adhering to the Cambridge platform, in forming a church, ordaining a mini&s;ter, di&s;|cipline, &amp;c. it has often &s;o happened in New-England, in Connecticut in particular, that &s;uch men mu&s;t be oppre&s;&s;ed by the laws of the colony, and their e&s;tates taken from them one &s;even years after another, to &s;upport another wor&s;hip than their own, a wor&s;hip they have no connection with, but only by living in the bounds of civil &s;ociety. And petitions to the general a&s;&s;embly for relief, in this ca&s;e, have been often repul&s;ed; and when and where it has been &s;o, how have particular towns and &s;ocieties been embolden'd, under the patronage of the legi&s;lators of the colony, to vote and take away the e&s;tates of their hone&s;t neighbours yearly, when they know in their con&s;cience 'tis not doing as they would be done by. But how righteous would it be in God to puni&s;h &s;uch law-makers, and tho&s;e who are hardy enough to put the &s;ame into execution, by bringing them under arbitrary laws of the &s;ame nature? How ju&s;t would the retalation be, if God &s;hould pay them in their own coin? What if the king of England &s;hould not only &s;end laws and acts of parliament to the colonies to cut &s;hort the liberties and freedom of the people here, which hitherto
<PB N="18" REF="013333_0010_0F9056CF5E8ED0A0">
we have enjoyed? But what if he &s;hould al&s;o &s;end &s;nipping, and force by &s;ea &s;ufficient to enforce them? e&s;pecially to enforce them on the capital towns and &s;ea-port places, or orders to de&s;troy them? And whether the re&s;olutions already formed in parliament to &s;ubject the colonies to their edicts, won't make even this probable, e&s;pecially when the &s;ame comes to be iritated and increa&s;ed by the news of the late conduct of the people of Bo&s;ton, de&s;troying &s;uch a quantity of Tea belonging to the Ea&s;t-India company, and de&s;troying of it on the very principle of refu&s;ing to &s;ub|ject to parliamentary power, making laws to bind the colonies. Now, the thing is, whether the next que&s;tion in parliament won't be, <HI>Who &s;hall &s;ubmit or yield, we, or the colonies?</HI> And whether it won't be natural for the parliament to think that they have gone too far already to drop the matter now, con&s;i&s;tent with their honor? And whether they won't al&s;o think that the colonies, Bo&s;ton in particular, have gone too far, in re|&s;i&s;ting their authority, to be &s;uffered to go unpuni&s;hed? And therefore with re&s;olution will rally all their force, rather than not &s;ubject the colo|nies? And on the other hand, the colonies &s;eeing the de&s;ign of parlia|ment acts, to abridge their liberties, and fearing what is to come of that nature, will doubtle&s;s, as they have already begun, endervour to unite and &s;trengthen them&s;elves by union, to re&s;i&s;t, all they can, the force of tho&s;e arbitrary acts. But what if this encrea&s;ing re&s;olution, and recollecting &s;trength on both &s;ides, &s;hould be the very means of mutual ruin? God can ea&s;ily make this u&s;e of it, and righteou&s;ly, on this wi&s;e, &s;courge a wicked nation and &s;inful land. However, we would gladly hope hea|ven won't &s;uffer things to be carried to that extreme; but who can &s;ay there is no danger of it? And have we not rea&s;on to fear &s;omething very calamitous of this nature will take place? And perhaps we &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing times in America, in New-England, than ever we &s;aw in all our northern war, with the French and &s;avage foe.</P>
<P>But what &s;hall the colonies do, or which way &s;hall they turn for re|lief? Why, &s;ome &s;eem to think that 'tis ea&s;y an&s;wered: They &s;ay, only let the colonies unite, and agree firmly that they won't import any more goods from Britain, till the&s;e acts are repeal'd, and England will &s;oon be obliged to yield. But I think the propo&s;ed remedy a very precarious and uncertain. For there may be great difficulty in getting the colonies to unite; and doubtle&s;s there will be men of influence in every colony of &s;uch a mercenary &s;pirit, that if they view it probable that their own honor and intere&s;t will be advanced by taking the parliament &s;ide, and pleading in favour of their right and power in matters relating to the
<PB N="19" REF="013333_0010_0F9056CF5E8ED0A0">
pre&s;ent controver&s;y, they will very readily do it; for if, as we have &s;een by public accounts given, that a native of the metropolis of New-England, advanced to the highe&s;t &s;eat of power in the government, viewing, as we may rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e, his honor and intere&s;t connected with that &s;ide the que&s;tion, could not only be willing that there &s;hould be &s;ome <HI>"abridg|ment of what is called Engli&s;h liberties,"</HI> but even <HI>court</HI> the &s;ame; &s;urely we can't have much dependance upon men, e&s;pecially men who are candi|dates for po&s;ts of honor and preferment. For the p&s;almi&s;t's ob&s;ervation is often a verified truth; <HI>men of low degree are vanity; and men of high de|gree are a lie;</HI> for they often deceive, as a lie doth, to the injury of tho&s;e who depend upon them. And be&s;ides. Suppo&s;e the union of the colo|nies &s;hould not be impeded, or ab&s;olutely hindred, by men who would, &s;acrifice the public good, to private intere&s;t, yet how do we know, but when the motion, and attempt for &s;uch a thing, comes to be under&s;tood or Britain, I &s;ay how do we know, but this very thing will be the means to increa&s;e and ha&s;ten parliamentary rage and re&s;olution, to be the more &s;peedy and &s;evere, in order to reduce, to their &s;ubjection, the capital towns, and the fir&s;t, and chief leaders, in the factions and rebellions of America, as they call it; and even if it be too much blood&s;hed, and the total ruin of valuable, and populous towns; and yet, flatter them&s;elves, that they are doing their duty in being vigorous in cru&s;hing rebellion in the bud, and by being &s;peedy, an&s;wer the end effectually, and &s;hed as little blood as may be and le&s;s than mu&s;t be if matters are delayed. But &s;ay &s;ome, our King won't be &s;o unwi&s;e, as really to de&s;troy his own &s;ubjects, and weaken his own kingdom, and thereby expo&s;e him&s;elf to his neighbouring enemies. To this it may be replied. Have we not often heard, and &s;ometimes &s;een, that wi&s;dom is &s;ometimes hid from the wi&s;e, and e&s;pecially, when the time is come, that God is determined to puni&s;h or de&s;troy them. And I look upon it, that the pre&s;ent melancholy appearances of things, by which the colonies are threatened, the kingdom is al&s;o threatened with ruin. But the que&s;tion recurs again, what mu&s;t be done? why, I am apt to think that it would be wi&s;e, and well, for all the colonies to unite, and every man in each colony, in all warrantable &s;teps under the guidance of wi&s;dom and prudence, to maintain their threatened rights and liberties, and even for individuals, in &s;uch a day as this, to be willing to &s;acrifice much of their private intere&s;t for the &s;ake of the public good. But I leave it to others to plan, in tho&s;e affairs which relate to &s;tate policy, and give my advice in another character. Therefore to the que&s;tion, in this di&s;tre&s;&s;ing day, what mu&s;t we do, what mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he colonies do?</P>

I an&s;wer, The be&s;t way is to take the &s;cripture advice, under threaten|ing judgments. <HI>Break off thy &s;ins by righteou&s;ne&s;s, and thine eniquities by &s;hew|ing mercy to the poor, if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquility.</HI> We &s;ee the &s;teps which Ninivah took, when threatened with immediate, de&s;truction, and the happy effect that followed, God &s;pared the city. Therefore let us all repent of our &s;ins, and unfeignedly turn to the Lord, that iniquity prove not our ruin. And this &s;hall be our &s;econd u&s;e.</P>
<P>USE 2. of exhortation. There is a loud call upon us now, to make God our friend, and that we may thus do, it is nece&s;&s;ary that we be recon|ciled to him; that we ca&s;t away our weapons of rebellion, and fall in humble &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion at Gods feet, begging for that mercy we have forfeited, and that we may e&s;cape that wrath we have merited. And if our humili|ation and repentance be &s;incere&mdash;univer&s;al or general&mdash;accompanied with reformation of all known evils, we may hope that the Lord will yet ap|pear for us and open &s;ome way for our e&s;cape even of tho&s;e temporal judgements with which this land is now threatened. And to excite one and all, now forthwith to &s;ee and feel the nece&s;&s;ity of repentance and re|formation in order warrantably, to hope that God will deliver us from im|pending danger, I &s;hall mention one or two things by way of motive.</P>
<P>And, 1. According to God's decree and appointment of events, God has been wont to connect <HI>means</HI> and <HI>end</HI> together. That in a time of dan|ger, if people become &s;en&s;ible, humble, penitent and reformed, this is wont to be the means, by which the end is brought about, viz. The de|liverence of that people from the threatened de&s;truction, as in the ca&s;e of Ninivah, &amp;c. So on the other hand, when a people are apparently threat|ened with di&s;truction, and they continue hardened, impenitent and unre|form'd, this is the means, in God's plan e&s;tabli&s;hed, to bring about the end, viz. The de&s;truction of that people.</P>
<P>So now, if we de&s;ire the end, viz. the deliverence of this land from the awful judgments with which we are threatened, then let us comply with; and be in the u&s;e of means requi&s;ite, that is, let us repent of &s;in and turn to God. See how this is repre&s;ented in Jer. xviii. 7. 8. <HI>At what in&s;tant I &s;hall &s;peak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up and to pull down, and to de&s;troy it: If that nation again&s;t whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil I tho't to do unto them.</HI></P>
<P>Now in &s;uch an in&s;tance as this we are not to &s;uppo&s;e, that there was really any change or alteration in God, although he conde&s;ends to &s;peak after the manner of men, as tho he repented and altered his purpo&s;e; for when men repent, they do change and alter their purpo&s;e; &s;o when God
<PB N="21" REF="013333_0011_0F9056D018911BB8">
altars his conduct towards a people, he &s;peaks to men as tho' he repent|ed. But in reality the change was in the people, and not in God; and when there became &s;uch a change in the people for the better, the end of the threatning was an&s;wered, and it became meet and &s;uitable that God &s;hould change his di&s;pen&s;ations towards them; and this &s;eems to be re|pre&s;ented as though he repented, altho' <HI>he is not a man that he &s;hould repent.</HI> But this conduct in God, in changing his di&s;pen&s;ations towards people, as they change, either for the better or for the wor&s;e, is entirely agreeable to God's immutable and eternal purpo&s;e and decree, becau&s;e therein he determined to do ju&s;t &s;o, connecting <HI>means</HI> and <HI>end</HI> together. And there|fore the way of e&s;cape is on this wi&s;e, now open to us, both by the decree connecting means and end, and the written word of God, propo&s;ing re|pentance as the means to e&s;cape either national or eternal de&s;truction. And therefore we ought to &s;ee, and feel, the nece&s;&s;ity of being in the ex|erci&s;e of the appointed means of &s;afety. And mankind will be volunta|ry in that conduct which will be the means, either to avert or bring ruin. And God in his providence now, as well as in his word, is &s;etting life and death before us, and is bidding us choo&s;e: and therefore, O, Ame|rica, O, New-England, be wi&s;e, and choo&s;e life.</P>
<P N="2">2. A &s;econd motive to urge all to repentance, and a genuine turning to the Lord, I &s;hall make u&s;e of is, <HI>The real &s;traits we are already plunged in, by things that have operated and took place.</HI> Parliament acts have took place, that is, they exi&s;t, are enjoin'd; oppo&s;ition and re&s;i&s;tance have took place; re&s;entment and re&s;olutions have took place; and what further will take place, who can tell? But let the colonies turn which way they will, are they not in an awful &s;trait? Suppo&s;e the colonies, for peace &s;ake, and to prevent the confu&s;ion and di&s;tre&s;s that is likely to follow, if they &s;hould continue to re&s;i&s;t parliament acts; I &s;ay, &s;uppo&s;e they &s;hould &s;ubmit, and comply with the claim of parliamentary power in pa&s;&s;ing acts to bind the colonies, and &s;ubmit to all they lay upon us, <HI>where will they &s;top?</HI> Who can tell that? Surely we know not. It may be, that their claims and their authority won't &s;top at temporal property; but when they have got the colonies all &s;ubjected, and fa&s;t bound as to that, &s;o that they can make but feeble or no re&s;i&s;tance at all, then perhaps our religious privileges and liberties will be call'd for next, and in lieu thereof Pope|ry enjoin'd. For I think that there is &s;uch a kindred and likene&s;s be|tween a de&s;potic power claim'd by mortals, arbitrary government, and Popery, that they who are friendly to the one, cannot be enemies to the other. But wo to the colonies, woe to New-England, if this &s;hould e|ver
<PB N="22" REF="013333_0012_0F9056D530AD6D00">
come to pa&s;s! and who can &s;ay we are out of danger? Not only to have temporal property at the di&s;po&s;al of arbitrary power, but con&s;cience bound by Popi&s;h chains, which, when thoroughly fa&s;tened upon us, a|way mu&s;t go our bibles, and in lieu thereof, we mu&s;t have impo&s;ed upon us, the &s;uper&s;titions and damnable here&s;ies and idolatries of the church of Rome. Then we mu&s;t pray to the Virgin Mary, wor&s;hip images, be|lieve the doctrine of Purgatory, and the Pope's infalibility, and &s;uch like. And la&s;t of all, the deepe&s;t plot of hell and Rome, the holy inqui&s;ition, mu&s;t guard the Catholic faith of the church of Rome, and bind us thereto with all its terrors and cruelty. O! who that is awake, with any &s;en&s;ibility hereof, had not rather loo&s;e their blood and lives too, than leave po&s;terity in &s;uch an awful &s;ituation! No wonder then, that men of &s;en&s;e and honor, no wonder that men of piety and religion, no wonder that men of con&s;cience and fidelity, are loth to &s;ubmit to that, which they have rea&s;on to think is leading towards this, and have rea&s;on to fear will terminate in this if &s;ubmitted to. While the enemies of our liber|ties would fain have it go that 'tis only the faction of mob and rabble that has made any oppo&s;ition, or that di&s;covers any reluctance in the af|fair. And if on the other hand, the colonies do not yield; if they think they are bound in faithfulne&s;s to our native rights, and Engli&s;h liberties, in faithfulne&s;s to them&s;elves, and to unborn po&s;terity, to re&s;i&s;t that claim of power that would en&s;lave them; yet what a &s;trait are the colonies plung|ed in, for who can tell how far to carry their re&s;i&s;tance? If re&s;i&s;ting by di&s;puting the point would do, a manly re&s;i&s;tance has already been made, by di&s;covering and vindicating our natural and con&s;titutional libertis; and by dint of argument have, on that wi&s;e, won the field, if we might be allow'd to po&s;&s;e&s;s the ju&s;t victory obtain'd; but we find that won't do our turn. And now we hear, that at Bo&s;ton, further re&s;i&s;tance has been made, even to the de&s;truction of property, which, certain it is, nothing but pure nece&s;&s;ity can warrant.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When I &s;ay nothing but pure nece&s;&s;ity can warrant the de&s;truction of property, re|ferring to the de&s;truction of the tea at Bo&s;ton, I mean not ab&s;olutely to determine whe|ther there was a real nece&s;&s;ity for it or no; for not having a univer&s;al acquaintance with the affair, as to the grounds, rea&s;ons or expediency, I mu&s;t in &s;ome &s;ort &s;u&s;pend my judg|ment for the pre&s;ent; altho' perhaps they were too ha&s;ty and ra&s;h, as it is natural to run into extremes, even in the defence of a ju&s;t cau&s;e, But however it were in this ca&s;e, I &s;uppo&s;e the nece&s;&s;ity may be &s;uch as will warrant the de&s;truction of property, and even of lives too, The Engli&s;h liberties are valuable and precious, and were not obtained but at the expence of much blood; and tamely to re&s;ign them up, whenever arbitrarily de|manded, argues more ba&s;ene&s;s than true loyalty of &s;pirit.</NOTE></P>
<P>And what &s;hall the colonies do? Shall they re&s;i&s;t further yet? Shall
<PB N="23" REF="013333_0012_0F9056D530AD6D00">
they re&s;i&s;t unto blood, or if they have &s;o done already, &s;hall they re&s;i&s;t un|to the &s;hedding of blood as well as the lo&s;s of blood? Or, if it &s;hould once come to blood-&s;hed another time, what woful times mu&s;t we expect?</P>
<P>So, it appears, I think, evident enough, to all who are not &s;tupidly blind, that the colonies now, are in a &s;ad and woful plunge let them turn which way they will, either &s;ubmit to or re&s;i&s;t the&s;e parliament acts; and what adds to the calamity is, the divided &s;entiments among us con|cerning what is right, and be&s;t for us to do, while &s;ome take one &s;ide the que&s;tion, and &s;ome the other.</P>
<P>And &s;urely we &s;tand in need of help from the Lord, that he would ap|pear in his kind providence, and deliver us out of this &s;trait. When the children of I&s;rael were brought into a &s;trait, and could &s;ee nothing but de&s;truction, the &s;ea before them, the Egyptians behind them, and mountains on either &s;ide, and &s;eem'd to be &s;hut up unto ruin; yet in the mount and mouth of danger, the Lord appeared, and opened a way un|known and unthought of by them for their e&s;cape. And as we are now threatned with ruin, and according to the appearance of things, &s;ome aw|ful judgments are nigh. Therefore, let one and all turn to the Lord, and &s;eek his mercy, <HI>before the decree bring forth,</HI> in our de&s;truction, <HI>before the days pa&s;s as the chaff, that we may be hid in the day of the Lord's anger;</HI> and imitate the Ninivites, when expo&s;ed to de&s;truction, who, from the great|e&s;t to the lea&s;t, humbled them&s;elves before the Lord in &s;ackloth and a&s;hes, and cried mightily to the Lord, upon this encouragement, <HI>Who can tell if the Lord will turn away his fierce wrath that we peri&s;h not.</HI></P>
