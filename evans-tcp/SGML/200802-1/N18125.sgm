<HEAD>The Rights of Con&s;cience inalienable, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are <HI>four</HI> principles contended for, as the foundation of civil government, viz. Birth, property, grace, and compact. The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> of the&s;e is practi&s;ed upon in all hereditary monarchies; where it is believed that the &s;on of a monarch is entitled to dominion, upon the decea&s;e of his father, whether he be a wi&s;e man or a fool. The <HI>&s;econd</HI> principle is built upon, in all ari&s;tocratical govern|ments, where the rich landholders have the &s;ole rule of all their tenants; and make laws, at plea|&s;ure, which are binding upon all. The <HI>third</HI> prin|ciple is adopted by tho&s;e kingdoms and &s;tates, that require a religious te&s;t to qualify an officer of &s;tate; pro&s;cribing all non-conformi&s;ts from civil and re|ligious liberty. This was the error of Con&s;tantine's government, who fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed the chri&s;tian re|ligion
<PB N="4" REF="023495_0003_0FBFA250AF60E030">
by law, and then pro&s;cribed the Pagans, and bani&s;hed the <HI>Arian hereticks.</HI> This error al&s;o filled the heads of the anabapti&s;ts in Germany (who were re-&s;prinklers.) They &s;uppo&s;ed that none had right to rule but gracious men. The &s;ame error prevails in the See of Rome, where his Holine&s;s exalts him&s;elf above all who are called God's, (i. e. kings and rulers) and where no prote&s;tant here|tick is allowed the liberty of a citizen. This prin|ciple is al&s;o plead for in the Ottoman Empire; where it is death to call in que&s;tion the divinity of Mahomed, or the authenticity of the Alcoran.</P>
<P>The &s;ame evil has twi&s;ted it&s;elf into the Briti&s;h form of government; where, in the &s;tate e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of the church of England, no man is eligible to any office, civil or military, without he &s;ub|&s;cribes to the 39 articles and book of common prayer; and even then, upon receiving a commi&s;|&s;ion for the army, the law obliges him to receive the &s;acrament of the Lord's-&s;upper: and no non-conformi&s;t is allowed the liberty of his con&s;cience, without he &s;ub&s;cribes to all the 39 articles but about four. And when that is done, his pur&s;e-&s;trings are drawn by others, to pay preachers, in whom he puts no confidence, and whom he never hears.</P>
<P>This was the ca&s;e of &s;everal of the Southern States (until the revolution), in which the church of England was e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>The <HI>fourth</HI> principle (compact) is adopted in the American States, as the ba&s;is of civil government. &mdash;This foundation appears to be a ju&s;t one, by the following inve&s;tigation.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="023495_0004_0FBFA2526975EFF8">Suppo&s;e a man to remove to a de&s;olate i&s;land, and take a peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, without injuring any; &s;o that he &s;hould be the hone&s;t inheritor of the i&s;le. So long as he is alone he is the ab&s;olute mo|narch of the place; and his own will is his law; which law, is as often altered or repealed as his will changes. In proce&s;s of time, from this man's loins ten &s;ons are grown to manhood, and po&s;&s;e&s;s pro|perty. So long as they are all good men, each one can be as ab&s;olute, free, and &s;overeign as his father: but one of the ten turns vagrant, by robbing the re&s;t. This villain is equal to, if not an over-match for any one of the nine: not one of them dur&s;t engage him, in &s;ingle combat. Rea&s;on and &s;afety both dictate to the nine, the nece&s;&s;ity of a confed|eration, to unite their &s;trength together to repel or de&s;troy the plundering knave. Upon entering into confederation, &s;ome <HI>compact</HI> or agreement would be &s;tipulated, by which each would be bound to do his equal part in fatigue and expence. It would be nece&s;&s;ary for the&s;e nine to meet at &s;tated times, to con&s;ult means of &s;afety and happine&s;s. A &s;hady tree or &s;mall cabbin, would an&s;wer their purpo&s;e: and in ca&s;e of di&s;agreement, 4 mu&s;t give up to 5.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of things, their government would be perfectly democratical; every citizen being a le|gi&s;lator.</P>
<P>In a cour&s;e of years, from the&s;e nine, there ari&s;es nine thou&s;and: their government can be no longer democratical&mdash;prudence would forbid it. Each tribe or di&s;trict, mu&s;t then chu&s;e their repre&s;entative, who (for the term that he is cho&s;en) has the whole po|litical
<PB N="6" REF="023495_0005_0FBFA259704E5D10">
power of his con&s;tituents. The&s;e repre&s;en|tatives, meeting in a&s;&s;embly, would have power to make laws, binding on their con&s;tituents; and while their time was &s;pent in making laws for the com|munity, each one of the community mu&s;t advance a little of his money as a compen&s;ation therefor.&mdash; Should the&s;e repre&s;entatives differ in judgement, the minor mu&s;t be &s;ubject to the major, as in the ca&s;e above.</P>
<P>From this &s;imple parable, the following things are demon&s;trated.</P>
<P>1. That the law was not made for a righteous man, but for the di&s;obedient. 2. That righteous men have to part with a little of their liberty and property to pre&s;erve the re&s;t. 3. That all power is ve&s;ted in, and con&s;equently derived from the people. 4. That the law &s;hould rule over rulers, and not rulers over the law. 5. That government is foun|ded on <HI>compact.</HI> 6. That every law made by the le|gi&s;lators, incon&s;i&s;tent with the <HI>compact,</HI> modernly called a con&s;titution, is u&s;urpive in the legi&s;lators, and not binding on the people. 7. That whenever government is found inadequate to pre&s;erve the li|berty, and property of the people, they have an indubitable right to alter it, &s;o as to an&s;wer tho&s;e purpo&s;es. 8. That legi&s;lators, in their legi&s;lative capacity, cannot alter the con&s;titution, for they are hired &s;ervants of the people, to act within the lim|its of the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>From the&s;e general ob&s;ervations, I &s;hall pa&s;s on to examine a que&s;tion, which has been the &s;trife and
<PB N="7" REF="023495_0006_0FBFA25D471B0FB0">
contention of ages.&mdash;The que&s;tion is, <HI>"Are the Rights of Con&s;cience alienable, or inalienable?"</HI></P>
<P>The word <HI>con&s;cience,</HI> &s;ignifies <HI>common &s;cience,</HI> a court of judicature which the Almighty has erected in every human brea&s;t: a <HI>cen&s;or morum</HI> over all his conduct. Con&s;cience will ever judge right, when it is rightly informed; and &s;peak the truth when it under&s;tands it. But to advert to the que&s;tion, <Q>Does a man, upon entering into &s;ocial compact, &s;urrender his con&s;cience to that &s;ociety, to be con|troled by the laws thereof; or can he, in ju&s;tice, a&s;&s;i&s;t in making laws to bind his children's con&s;ci|ences before they are born?</Q> I judge not, for the following rea&s;ons.</P>
<P N="1">1. Every man mu&s;t give an account of him&s;elf to God, and therefore every man ought to be at liberty to &s;erve God in that way that he can be&s;t reconcile it to his con&s;cience. If Government, can an&s;wer for Individuals at the day of judgement, let men be con|troled by it, in religious matters; otherwi&s;e, let men be free.</P>
<P N="2">2. It would be &s;inful for a man to &s;urrender that to man, which is to be kept &s;acred for God. A man's mind &s;hould be always open to conviction; and an hone&s;t man will receive that doctrine which appears the be&s;t demon&s;trated: and what is more common than for the be&s;t of men to change their minds? Such are the prejudices of the mind, and &s;uch the force of tradition, that a man who never alters his mind, is either very weak or very &s;tubborn. How painful then mu&s;t it be to an hone&s;t heart, to be bound to
<PB N="8" REF="023495_0007_0FBFA25E5891C798">
ob&s;erve the principles of his former belief, after he is convinced of their imbecility? and this ever has, and ever will be the ca&s;e, while the rights of con|&s;cience are con&s;idered alienable.</P>
<P N="3">3. But &s;uppo&s;ing it was right for a man to bind his own con&s;cience, yet &s;urely it is very iniquitous to bind the con&s;ciences of his children&mdash;to make fetters for them before they are born, is very cruel. And yet &s;uch has been the conduct of men in almo&s;t all ages, that their children have been bound to be|lieve and wor&s;hip as their fathers did, or &s;uffer &s;hame, lo&s;s, and &s;ometimes life; and at be&s;t, to be called di&s;|&s;enters; becau&s;e they di&s;&s;ent from that which they never joined voluntarily. Such conduct in parents, is wor&s;e than that of the father of <HI>Hannibal,</HI> who impo&s;ed an oath upon his &s;on, while a child, never to be at peace with the Romans.</P>
<P N="4">4. Finally, religion is a matter between God and individuals: religious opinions of men not being the objects of civil government, nor any ways under its control.</P>
<P>It has often been ob&s;erved, by the friends of reli|gious e&s;tabli&s;hment by human laws, that no &s;tate can long continue without it; that religion will peri&s;h, and nothing but infidelity and athei&s;m prevail.</P>
<P>Are the&s;e things facts?&mdash;Did not the chri&s;tian re|ligion prevail during the three fir&s;t centuries, in a more glorious manner than ever it has &s;ince; not on|ly without the aid of law, but in oppo&s;ition to all the laws of haughty monarchs? And did not religion receive a deadly wound by being fo&s;tered in the arms of civil power and regulated by law? The&s;e things are &s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="023495_0008_0FBFA2602FAB2BB8">From that day to this, we have but a few in&s;tan|ces of religious liberty to judge by; for in almo&s;t all &s;tates, civil rulers (by the in&s;tigation of covetous prie&s;ts) have undertaken to &s;teady the ark of reli|gion, by human laws; but yet we have a few of them, without leaving our own land.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of Rhode-I&s;land has &s;tood above 160 years without any religious e&s;tabli&s;hment. The &s;tate of New-York never had any. New-Jer&s;ey claims the &s;ame. Penn&s;ylvania has al&s;o &s;tood from its fir&s;t &s;ettlement until now upon a liberal foun|dation: and if agriculture, the mechanical arts and commerce have not flouri&s;hed in the&s;e &s;tates, equal to any of the &s;tates, I judge wrong.</P>
<P>It may further be ob&s;erved, that all the &s;tates now in union, &s;aving two or three in New-Eng|land, have no legal force u&s;ed about religion, in directing its cour&s;e or &s;upporting its preachers.&mdash; And moreover, the federal government is forbidden by the con&s;titution, to make any laws, e&s;tabli&s;hing any kind of religion. If religion cannot &s;tand, therefore, without the aid of law, it is likely to fall &s;oon, in our nation, except in Connecticut and Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts.</P>
<P>To &s;ay, that "Religion cannot &s;tand without a &s;tate e&s;tabli&s;hment," is not only contrary to fact, (as has been proved already) but is a contradiction in phra&s;e. Religion mu&s;t have &s;tood a time before any law could have been made about it; and if it did &s;tand almo&s;t 300 years without law, it can &s;till &s;tand without it.</P>
<P>The evils of &s;uch an e&s;tabli&s;hment are many.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="10" REF="023495_0009_0FBFA262B53C3838">1. Unin&s;pired, fallible men make their own o|pinions te&s;ts of orthodoxy, and u&s;e their own &s;y&s;t|ems, as <HI>Rocru&s;tus</HI> u&s;ed his iron bed&s;tead; to &s;tretch and mea&s;ure the con&s;ciences of all others by.&mdash; Where no toleration is granted to non-conformi&s;ts, either ignorance and &s;uper&s;tition prevail, or per&s;e|cution rages: and if toleration is granted to re|&s;tricted non-conformi&s;ts, the minds of men are bia&s;&s;ed, to embrace that religion which is favored and pampered by law, (and thereby hypocri&s;y is nouri&s;hed) while tho&s;e who cannot &s;tretch their con&s;ciences to believe any thing and every thing in the e&s;tabli&s;hed creed, are treated with contempt and opprobrious names; and by &s;uch means &s;ome are pampered to death by large&s;&s;es, and others con|fined from doing what good, they otherwi&s;e could, by penury. The fir&s;t lie under a temptation to flatter the ruling party, to continue that form of government, which brings them in the &s;ure bread of idlene&s;s; the la&s;t to de&s;pi&s;e that government, and tho&s;e rulers that oppre&s;s them.&mdash;The fir&s;t have their eyes &s;hut to all further light, that would alter the religious machine, the la&s;t are always &s;eeking new light, and often fall into enthu&s;ia&s;m. Such are the natural evils of e&s;tabli&s;hment in re|ligion by human laws.</P>
<P N="2">2. Such e&s;tabli&s;hments not only wean and alien|ate the affections of one from another, on account of the different u&s;ages they receive, in their religious &s;entiments, but are al&s;o very impolitic, e&s;pecially in new countries; for what encouragement can &s;tran|gers
<PB N="11" REF="023495_0010_0FBFA2662153A590">
have to migrate with their arts and wealth into a &s;tate, where they cannot enjoy their reli|gious &s;entiments without expo&s;ing them&s;elves to the law? when, at the &s;ame time, their religious opinions do not lead them to be mutinous. And further, how often have kingdoms and &s;tates been greatly weak|ened by religious te&s;ts! In the time of the per&s;ecu|tion in France, not le&s;s than twenty thou&s;and peo|ple fled, for the enjoyment of religious liberty.</P>
<P N="3">3. The&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hments, metamorphi&s;e the church into a creature, and religion into a principle of &s;tate; which has a natural tendency to make men conclude that <HI>bible religion</HI> is nothing but a <HI>trick of &s;tate</HI>: hence it is that the greate&s;t part of the well informed in literature, are over-run with dei&s;m and infidelity; nor is it likely that it will ever be much better, while preaching is made a trade of emolument. And if there is no difference between <HI>bible religion</HI> and <HI>&s;tate religion,</HI> I &s;hall &s;oon fall into infidelity.</P>
<P N="4">4. There are no two kingdoms and &s;tates that e&s;tabli&s;h the &s;ame creed and formularies of faith, (which alone proves their debility). In one king|dom a man is condemned for not believing a doct|rine that he would be condemned for believing in another kingdom. Both of the&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hments can|not be right&mdash;but both of them can be, and &s;urely are, wrong.</P>
<P N="5">5. The nature of &s;uch e&s;tabli&s;hments, further is, to keep from civil office, the be&s;t of men. Good men
<PB N="12" REF="023495_0011_0FBFA26EA7B106A8">
cannot believe what they cannot believe; and they will not &s;ub&s;cribe to what they di&s;believe; and take an oath to maintain what they conclude is error: and as the be&s;t of men differ in judgement, there may be &s;ome of them in any &s;tate: their talents and virtue entitle them to fill the mo&s;t important po&s;ts, yet becau&s;e they differ from the e&s;tabli&s;hed creed of the &s;tate, they cannot&mdash;will not fill tho&s;e po&s;ts&punc; Whereas villains make no &s;cruple to take any oath.</P>
<P>If the&s;e, and many more evils, attend &s;uch e&s;tab|li&s;hments, What were, and &s;till are the cau&s;es that ever there &s;hould be a &s;tate e&s;tabli&s;hment of religion in any empire, kingdom, or &s;tate?</P>
<P>The cau&s;es are many;&mdash;&s;ome of which follow:</P>
<P N="1">1. The love of importance is a general evil. It is natural to men, to dictate for others: they chu&s;e to command the bu&s;hel and u&s;e the whip-row; to have the halter around the necks of others, to hang them at plea&s;ure.</P>
<P N="2">2. An over-fondne&s;s for a particular &s;y&s;tem or &s;ect. This gave ri&s;e to the fir&s;t human e&s;tabli&s;hment of religion, by Con&s;tantine the Great. Being con|verted to the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem, he e&s;tabli&s;hed it in the Roman empire, compelled the pagans to &s;ubmit, and bani&s;hed the chri&s;tian hereticks; built fine chapels at public expence, and forced large &s;tipends for the preachers. All this was done out of love to the chri&s;tian religion; but his love operated inadvertent|ly; for he did the chri&s;tian church more harm than all the per&s;ecuting emperors ever did. It is &s;aid, that in his day, a voice was heard from heaven, &s;aying,
<PB N="13" REF="023495_0012_0FBFA270D0243F78">
"Now is poi&s;on &s;pued into the churches." If this voice was not heard, it neverthele&s;s was a truth; for from that day to this, the chri&s;tian religion has been made a &s;tirrup to mount the &s;teed of popularity, wealth and ambition.</P>
<P N="3">3. To produce uniformity in religion. Rulers often fear that if they leave every man to think, &s;peak and wor&s;hip as he plea&s;es, that the whole cau&s;e will be wrecked in diver&s;ity: to prevent which, they e|&s;tabli&s;h &s;ome &s;tandard of orthodoxy, to effect unifor|mity. But, is uniformity attainable? Millions of men, women and children have been tortured to death, to produce uniformity, and yet the world has not advanced one inch towards it. And as long as men live in different parts of the world, have differ|ent habits, education and intere&s;ts, they will be dif|ferent in judgement, humanly &s;peaking.</P>
<P>Is uniformity of &s;entiments, in matters of religion, e&s;&s;ential to the happine&s;s of civil government?&mdash; Not at all. Government has no more to do with the religious opinions of men, than it has with the prin|ciples of the mathematicks. Let every man &s;peak freely without fear&mdash;maintain the principles that he believes&mdash;wor&s;hip according to his own faith, either one God, three Gods, no God, or twenty Gods; and let government protect him in &s;o doing, i. e. &s;ee that he meets with no per&s;onal abu&s;e or lo&s;s of property, for his religious opinions. In&s;tead of di&s;couraging of him with pro&s;criptions, fines, confi&s;cation or death, let him be encouraged, as a free man, to bring forth his arguments and maintain his points with all boldne&s;s: then, if his doctrine is fal&s;e, it will be
<PB N="14" REF="023495_0013_0FBFA271DC72D640">
confuted, and if it is true (tho' ever &s;o novel) let others credit it.</P>
<P>When every man has this liberty, what can he wi&s;h for more?&mdash;A liberal man a&s;ks for nothing more of government.</P>
<P>The duty of magi&s;trates is, not to judge of the divinity or tendency of doctrines; but when tho&s;e principles break out into overt acts of violence, then to u&s;e the civil &s;word and puni&s;h the vagrant for what he has done, and not for the religious phrenzy that he acted from.</P>
<P>It is not &s;uppo&s;eable, that any e&s;tabli&s;hed creed contains the whole truth, and nothing but truth;&mdash; but &s;uppo&s;ing it did&mdash;which e&s;tabli&s;hed church in the world has got it? All bigots contend for it:&mdash; each &s;ociety cries out, "The temple of the Lord are we." Let one &s;ociety be &s;uppo&s;ed to be in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole&mdash;let that &s;ociety be e&s;tabli&s;hed by law&mdash;the creed of faith that they adopt be con|&s;ecrated &s;o &s;acred by government, that the man that di&s;believes it mu&s;t die&mdash;let this creed finally prevail over the whole world. I a&s;k, what honor <HI>truth</HI> gets by all this? None at all. It is famed of a Pru&s;&s;ian, called John the Cicero, that by one oration he recon|ciled two contending princes, actually in war: but, &s;ays the hi&s;torian, "It was his &s;ix thou&s;and hor&s;e of battle that had the mo&s;t per&s;ua&s;ive oratory." So when one creed or church prevails over another, be|ing armed with (a coat of mail) law and &s;word, truth gets no honor by the victory. Whereas if all &s;tand upon one footing, being equally protected by law, as citizens, (not as &s;aints) and one prevails over another
<PB N="15" REF="023495_0014_0FBFA27347DD1790">
by cool inve&s;tigation and fair argument, then truth gains honor; and men more firmly believe it, than if it was made an e&s;&s;ential article of &s;alvation, by law.</P>
<P>Truth di&s;dains the aid of law for its defence&mdash;it will &s;tand upon its own merit. The heathens wor|&s;hiped a godde&s;s, called truth, &s;tark naked; and all human decorations of truth, &s;erve only to de&s;troy her virgin beauty. It is error, and error alone, that needs human &s;upport; and whenever men fly to the law or &s;word to protect their &s;y&s;tem of religion, and force it upon others, it is evident that they have &s;ome|thing in their &s;y&s;tem that will not bear the light, and &s;tand upon the ba&s;is of truth.</P>
<P N="4">4. The common objection, "that the ignorant part of the community are not capacitated to judge for them&s;elves," &s;upports the popi&s;h hierarchy, and all prote&s;tant as well as turki&s;h and pagan e&s;tabli&s;h|ments, in idea.</P>
<P>But is this idea ju&s;t? Has God cho&s;en many of the wi&s;e and learned? Has he not hid the my&s;tery of go&s;pel truth from them, and revealed it unto babes? Does the world, by wi&s;dom, know God? Did many of the rulers believe in Chri&s;t when he was upon earth? Were not the learned clergy (the &s;cribes) his mo&s;t inveterate enemies? Do not great men differ as much as little men in judgement? Have not almo&s;t all lawle&s;s errors crept into the world through the means of wi&s;e men (&s;o called)? Is not a &s;imple man, who makes nature and rea&s;on his &s;tudy, a competent judge of things? Is the bible written (like Caligula's laws) &s;o intricate and high that none but the letter learned (according to com|mon
<PB N="16" REF="023495_0015_0FBFA278144EBB00">
phra&s;e) can read it? Is not the vi&s;ion written &s;o plain that he that runs may read it? Do not tho&s;e who under&s;tand the original languages, that the bible was written in, differ as much in judgement as others? Are the identical copies of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, together with the epi&s;tles, in every univer&s;ity, and in the hands of every ma&s;ter of arts? If not, have not the learned to tru&s;t to a human tran&s;cription, as much as the unlearned have to a tran&s;lation? If the&s;e que&s;tions, and others of the like nature, can be confuted&mdash;then I will confe&s;s that it is wi&s;dom for a conclave of bi&s;hops, or a convocation of clergy to frame a &s;y&s;tem out of the bible, and per&s;uade the legi&s;lature to legalize it.&mdash; No.&mdash;It would be attended with &s;o much expence, pride, domination, cruelty and blood&s;hed, that let me rather fall into infidelity: for no religion at all, is better than that which is wor&s;e than none.</P>
<P N="5">5. The ground work of the&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hments of religion is, <HI>clerical influence.</HI> Rulers, being per&s;uad|ed by the clergy that an e&s;tabli&s;hment of religion by human laws, would promote the knowledge of the go&s;pel, quell religious di&s;putes, prevent here&s;y, pro|duce uniformity, and finally be advantageous to the &s;tate, e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch creeds as are framed by the cler|gy:&mdash;and this they often do the more readily, when they are flattered by the clergy; that if they thus defend the truth, they will become <HI>nur&s;ing fathers</HI> to the church, and merit &s;omething con&s;iderable for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>What &s;timulates the clergy to recommend this mode of rea&s;oning is,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="17" REF="023495_0016_0FBFA27B0FB8FE70">1. Ignorance&mdash;not being able to confute error by fair argument.</P>
<P N="2">2. Indolence&mdash;not being willing to &s;pend any time to confute the heretical.</P>
<P N="3">3. But chiefly covetou&s;ne&s;s, to get money&mdash;for it may be ob&s;erved that in all the&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hments, &s;et|tled &s;alaries for the clergy, recoverable by law, are &s;ure to be interwoven: and was not this the ca&s;e, I am well convinced that there would not be many, if any religious e&s;tabli&s;hments, in the chri&s;tian world.</P>
<P>Having made the foregoing remarks, I &s;hall next make &s;ome ob&s;ervations on the religion of <HI>Connecticut.</HI></P>
<P>If the citizens of this &s;tate, have any thing in exi&s;t|ence that looks like a religious e&s;tabli&s;hment, they ought to be very cautious; for being but a &s;mall part of the world, they can never expect to extend their religion over the whole of it, without it is &s;o well founded that it cannot be confuted.</P>
<P>If one third part of the face of the globe is allowed to be &s;eas, the earthy parts would compo&s;e 4550 &s;uch &s;tates as Connecticut. The American empire would afford above 200 of them. And as there is no religion in this empire, of the &s;ame &s;tamp of the Connecticut <HI>&s;tanding order,</HI> upon the Say-Brook plat|form, they may expect 199 again&s;t 1, at home, and 4549 again&s;t 1 abroad.</P>
<P>Connecticut and New-Haven were &s;eparate go|vernments till the reign of Charles II. when they were incorporated together by a charter; which char|ter is &s;till con&s;idered, by &s;ome, as the ba&s;is of go|vernment.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent, there are in the &s;tate about 168 pre&s;by|terial
<PB N="18" REF="023495_0017_0FBFA27C40CED538">
congregational and con&s;ociated preachers; 35 bapti&s;ts; 20 epi&s;copalians; 10 &s;eparate-congregation|als, and a few of other denominations. The fir&s;t are the <HI>&s;tanding order</HI> of Connecticut; to whom all others have to pay obei&s;ance. Societies of the <HI>&s;tand|ing order</HI> are formed by law: none have right to vote therein but men, of age, who po&s;&s;e&s;s property to the amount of 40<HI>l.</HI> and are in full communion in the church. Their choice of mini&s;ters is by ma|jor vote; and what the &s;ociety agree to give him annually, is levied upon all within the limits of the &s;ociety-bounds; except they bring a certificate to the clerk of the &s;ociety, that they attend wor&s;hip el&s;ewhere, and contribute to the &s;atisfaction of the &s;ociety where they attend. The money being levied on the people, is de&s;trainable by law; and perpetu|ally binding on the &s;ociety till the mini&s;ter is di&s;mi&s;&s;|ed by a council, or by death, from his charge.</P>
<P>It is not my intention to give a detail of all the tumults, oppre&s;&s;ion, fines and impri&s;onments, that have heretofore been occa&s;ioned by this <HI>law-religion.</HI> The&s;e things are partly dead and buried, and if they do not ri&s;e of them&s;elves, let them &s;leep peaceably in the du&s;t forever. Let it &s;uffice on this head, to &s;ay, that it is not po&s;&s;ible, in the nature of things, to e&s;tabli&s;h religion by human laws, without perverting the de&s;ign of civil law and oppre&s;&s;ing the people.</P>
<P>The certificate that a di&s;&s;enter produces to the &s;ociety clerk, mu&s;t be &s;igned by &s;ome officer of the di&s;&s;enting church, and &s;uch church mu&s;t be prote&s;t|ant-chri&s;tian; for heathens, dei&s;ts, jews and papi&s;ts are not indulged in the certificate law: all of them&punc;
<PB N="19" REF="023495_0018_0FBFA27E282BB8D0">
as well as turks, mu&s;t therefore be taxed to the &s;tanding order, although they never go among them, or know where the meeting-hou&s;e is.</P>
<P>This certificate law is founded on this principle, "That it is the duty of all per&s;ons to &s;upport the go&s;pel and the wor&s;hip of God." Is this principle founded in ju&s;tice? Is it the duty of a dei&s;t to &s;up|port that which he believes to be a cheat and impo|&s;ition? Is it the duty of a jew to &s;upport the reli|gion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, when he really believes that he was an impo&s;tor? Mu&s;t the papi&s;ts be forced to pay men for preaching down the &s;upremacy of the pope, whom they are &s;ure is the head of the church? Mu&s;t a turk maintain a religion, oppo&s;ed to the <HI>alkoran,</HI> which he holds as the &s;acred oracles of hea|ven? The&s;e things want better confirmation. If we &s;uppo&s;e that it is the duty of all the&s;e to &s;upport the prote&s;tant chri&s;tian religion, as being the be&s;t religion in the world; yet how comes it to pa&s;s that human legi&s;latures have right to force them &s;o to do? I now call for an in&s;tance where Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the author of his religion, or the apo&s;tles, who were divinely in&s;pired, ever gave orders to, or intimated that the civil powers on earth ought to force people to ob&s;erve the rules and doctrine of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P><HI>Mahomed</HI> called in the u&s;e of law and &s;word to convert people to his religion; but Je&s;us did not&mdash; does not.</P>
<P>It is the duty of men to love God with all their hearts, and their neighbours as them&s;elves; but have legi&s;latures authority to puni&s;h men if they do not? &mdash;So there are many things that Je&s;us and the apo|&s;tles
<PB N="20" REF="023495_0019_0FBFA280F3D2F3D8">
taught, that men ought to obey, which yet the civil law has no concerns in.</P>
<P>That it is the duty of men, who are taught in the word, to communicate to him that teaches, is be|yond controver&s;y; but that it is the province of the civil law to force them to do &s;o, is denied.</P>
<P>The charter of Charles the &s;econd, is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the ba&s;is of government in Connecticut; and I reque&s;t any gentleman to point out a &s;ingle clau&s;e in that charter, which authorizes the legi&s;lature to make any religious laws, e&s;tabli&s;h any religion, or force people to build meeting-hou&s;es or pay preach|ers. If there is no &s;uch con&s;titutional clau&s;e, it follows, that the laws are u&s;urpa&s;ive in the legi&s;la|tors and not binding on the people. I &s;hall here add, that if the legi&s;lature of Connecticut have au|thority to e&s;tabli&s;h the religion which they prefer to all religions, and force men to &s;upport it; then every legi&s;lature or legi&s;lator has the &s;ame authority; and if this be true, the &s;eparation of the chri&s;tians from the pagans, the departure of the prote&s;tants from the papi&s;ts, and the di&s;&s;ention of the pre&s;by|terians from the church of England were all &s;chi&s;ms of a criminal nature; and all the per&s;ecution that they have met with, is the ju&s;t effect of their &s;tub|bornne&s;s.</P>
<P>The certificate law &s;uppo&s;es, 1. That the legi&s;la|ture have power to e&s;tabli&s;h a religion. This is fal&s;e. 2. That they have authority to grant indul|gence to non-conformi&s;ts:&mdash;this is al&s;o fal&s;e; for religious liberty is a <HI>right</HI> and not a <HI>favor.</HI> 3. That
<PB N="21" REF="023495_0020_0FBFA287843F6ED0">
the legitimate power of government extends to force people to part with their money for religious pur|po&s;es. This cannot be proved from the new te&s;ta|ment.</P>
<P>The certificate law has lately pa&s;&s;ed a new mod|ification. Ju&s;tices of the peace mu&s;t now examine them;&mdash;this gives mini&s;ters of &s;tate a power over religious concerns that the new-te&s;tament does not. &mdash;To examine the law, part by part, would be needle&s;s&mdash;for the whole of it is wrong.</P>
<P>From what is &s;aid, this que&s;tion ari&s;es, "Are not contracts with mini&s;ters, i. e. between mini&s;ters and people, as obligatory as any contracts whatever?" &mdash;The &s;imple an&s;wer is, Yes. Mini&s;ters &s;hould &s;hare the &s;ame protection of the law, that other men do, and no more. To pro&s;cribe them from &s;eats of legi&s;lation, &amp;c. is cruel. To indulge them with an exemption from taxes and bearing arms, is a tempt|ing emolument. The law &s;hould be &s;ilent about them; protect them as citizens, (not as &s;acred offi|cers) for the civil law knows no &s;acred, religious officers.</P>
<P>In Rhode-I&s;land, if a congregation of people a|gree to give a preacher a certain &s;um of money for preaching, the bond is not recoverable by law.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some men, who are be&s;t informed in the laws of Rhode-I&s;land, &s;ay, that if ever there was &s;uch an a<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> in that &s;tate, there is nothing like it in exi&s;tence at this day; and perhaps it is only ca&s;t upon them as a &s;tigma, becau&s;e they have ever been friends to religious liberty. However, as the principle is &s;upportable, I have treated it as a real fact: and this I have done th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ore willingly, becau&s;e nine-tenths of the people believe it is a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="023495_0021_0FBFA28A9DAC92A8">This law was formed upon a good principle, but, unhappy for the makers of that law, they were in|coherent in the &s;uper&s;tructure.</P>
<P>The principle of the law, is, that the go&s;pel is not to be &s;upported by law; that civil rulers have no|thing to do with religion, in their civil capacities; What bu&s;ine&s;s had they then to make that law?&mdash; The evil &s;eemed to ari&s;e from a blending religious <HI>right</HI> and religious <HI>opinions</HI> together. Religious <HI>right</HI> &s;hould be protected to <HI>all</HI> men, religious <HI>opinion</HI> to none; i. e. government &s;hould confirm the fir&s;t unto all; the la&s;t unto none: each individual having a <HI>right</HI> to differ from all others in <HI>opinion</HI> if he is &s;o per&s;uaded. If a number of people in Rhode-I&s;land or el&s;ewhere are of opinion, that mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel ought to be &s;upported by law, and chu&s;e to be bound by a bond to pay him; government has no ju&s;t authority to declare that bond illegal; for in &s;o doing, they interfere with private contracts, and deny the people the liberty of con&s;cience. If the&s;e people bind nobody but them&s;elves&mdash;who is injured by their religious opinions? But if they bind an individual be&s;ides them&s;elves, the bond is fraudulent, and ought to be declared illegal. And here lies the mi&s;chief of Connecticut religion. My lord, major vote, binds all the minor part, unle&s;s they &s;ubmit to idolatry; i. e. pay an acknowledgement to a power that Je&s;us Chri&s;t never ordained in his church; I mean produce a certificate. Yea further, jews, turks, heathens, papi&s;ts and dei&s;ts, if &s;uch there are in Connecticut, are bound, and have no redre&s;s: and further, this bond is not annually given, but for
<PB N="23" REF="023495_0022_0FBFA2901B22BF30">
life, except the mini&s;ter is di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by a number of others, who are in the &s;ame predicament with him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Although it is no abridgement of religious lib|erty for congregations to pay their preachers by legal force, in the manner pre&s;cribed above, yet it is antichri&s;tian; &s;uch a church cannot be a church of Chri&s;t, becau&s;e they are not governed by Chri&s;t's laws, but by the laws of &s;tate; and &s;uch mini&s;ters do not appear like amba&s;&s;adors of Chri&s;t, but like mini&s;ters of &s;tate.</P>
<P>The next que&s;tion is this, "Suppo&s;e a congre|gation of people have agreed to give a mini&s;ter a certain &s;um of money annually, for life or during good behaviour; and in a cour&s;e of time, &s;ome or all of them change their opinions, and verily be|lieve that the preacher is in a capital error; and really from con&s;cience, di&s;&s;ent from him&mdash;are they &s;till bound to comply with their engagements to the preacher?"&mdash;This que&s;tion is &s;uppo&s;eable, and I believe there have been a few in&s;tances of the kind.</P>
<P>If men have bound them&s;elves&mdash;honor and hon|e&s;ty call upon them to comply&mdash;but God and con|&s;cience call upon them to come out from among them, and let &s;uch blind guides alone.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The phra&s;e of <HI>blind guides,</HI> is not intended to ca&s;t contempt upon any order of religious preachers; for, let a preacher be or|thodox or hetrodox, virtuous or vicious, he is always a <HI>blind guide</HI> to tho&s;e who differ from him in opinion.</NOTE> Honor and hone&s;ty are amiable virtues; but God and con|&s;cience
<PB N="24" REF="023495_0023_0FBFA292B60986D0">
call to perfidiou&s;ne&s;s. This &s;hows the im|propriety of &s;uch contracts&mdash;which always may, and &s;ometimes do lead into &s;uch labyrinths. Time enough to pay a man after his labour is over.&mdash; People are not required to communicate to the <HI>teacher</HI> before they are <HI>taught.</HI> A man, called of God to preach, feels a nece&s;&s;ity to preach, and a woe if he does not. And if he is &s;ent by Chri&s;t he looks to him and his laws for &s;upport; and if men com|ply with their duty, he finds relief; if not, he mu&s;t go to his field, as the prie&s;ts of old did. A man cannot give a more glaring proof of his covetou&s;ne&s;s and irreligion, than to &s;ay, "If you will give me &s;o much, then I will preach, but if not, be a&s;&s;ured I will not preach to you."</P>
<P>So that in an&s;wering the que&s;tion, in&s;tead of de|termining which of the evils to chu&s;e; either to di&s;obey God and con&s;cience, or break honour and hone&s;ty, I would recommend an e&s;cape of both evils, by entering into no &s;uch contracts: for the natural evils of imprudence, that men are fallen into, neither God nor man can prevent.</P>
<P>A mini&s;ter mu&s;t have a hard heart, to wi&s;h men to be forced to pay him, when (thro' con&s;cience, en|thu&s;ia&s;m, or a private pique) they di&s;&s;ent from his mini&s;try. The &s;pirit of the go&s;pel di&s;dains &s;uch mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion before us, is not applicable to many ca&s;es in Connecticut: the di&s;&s;enting churches make no contracts for a longer term than a year, and mo&s;t of them make none at all. Societies, of the <HI>&s;tand|ing order,</HI> rarely bind them&s;elves, in contract with
<PB N="25" REF="023495_0024_0FBFA2943439C040">
preachers, without binding others be&s;ide them&s;elves: and when that is the ca&s;e the bond is fraudulent: and if tho&s;e who are bound involuntarily can get clear, it is no breach of honor or hone&s;ty.</P>
<P>A few additional remarks &s;hall clo&s;e my piece.</P>
<P N="1">I. The church of Rome, was at fir&s;t con&s;tituted according to the go&s;pel; and at that time her faith was &s;poken of through the whole world. Being e&s;pou&s;ed to Chri&s;t, as a cha&s;te virgin, &s;he kept her bed pure for her hu&s;band, almo&s;t three hundred years: but afterwards &s;he played the whore with the kings and princes of this world; who with their gold and wealth came in unto her, and &s;he became a &s;trum|pet:&mdash;and as &s;he was the fir&s;t chri&s;tian church that ever for&s;ook the laws of Chri&s;t for her conduct; and received the laws of his rivals; i. e. was e&s;ta|bli&s;hed by human law, and governed by the legali|zed edicts of councils; and received large &s;ums of money to &s;upport her preachers and her wor&s;hip, by the force of civil power&mdash;&s;he is called the MO|THER OF HARLOTS: and all prote&s;tant church|es, who are regulated by law, and force people to &s;upport their preachers, build meeting-hou&s;es and otherwi&s;e maintain their wor&s;hip, are DAUGHTERS of this HOLY MOTHER.</P>
<P N="2">II. I am not a citizen of Connecticut&mdash;the reli|gious laws of the &s;tate do not oppre&s;s me, and I expect never will per&s;onally; but a love to religious liberty in general induces me thus to &s;peak. Was
<PB N="26" REF="023495_0025_0FBFA295AD383F88">
I a re&s;ident in the &s;tate, I could not give or receive a certificate to be exempted from mini&s;terial taxes; for in &s;o doing I &s;hould confe&s;s that the legi&s;lature had authority, to pamper one religious order in the &s;tate, and make all others pay obei&s;ance to that <HI>&s;heef.</HI> &mdash;It is high time to know whether all are to be free alike; and whether mini&s;ters of &s;tate are to be lords over God's heritage.</P>
<P>And here I &s;hall a&s;k the citizens of Connecticut, Whether, in the months of April and September, when they chu&s;e their deputies for the a&s;&s;embly, they mean to &s;urrender to them the rights of con&s;cience, and authorize them to make laws, binding on their con&s;ciences? If not, then all &s;uch acts are con|trary to the intention of con&s;tituent power, as well as uncon&s;titutional and antichri&s;tian.</P>
<P N="3">III. It is likely that one part of the people in Connecticut believe, in con&s;cience, that go&s;pel preach|ers &s;hould be &s;upported by the force of law; and the other part believe that it is not in the province of civil law to interfere or any ways meddle with religious matters. How are both parties to be pro|tected by law, in their con&s;ciencious belief?</P>
<P>Very ea&s;ily.&mdash;Let all tho&s;e who&s;e con&s;ciences dic|tate that they ought to be taxed by law to maintain their preacher, bring in their names to the &s;ociety-clerk, by a certain day, and then a&s;&s;e&s;s them all, according to their e&s;tates, to rai&s;e the &s;um, &s;tipulated in the contract; and all others go free. Both par|ties, by this method would enjoy the full liberty of con&s;cience, without oppre&s;&s;ing one another&mdash;the law
<PB N="27" REF="023495_0026_0FBFA2A001CB7900">
u&s;e no force in matters of con&s;cience&mdash;the evil of Rhode-I&s;land law be e&s;caped&mdash;and no per&s;ons could find fault with it (in a political point of view), but tho&s;e who fear the con&s;ciences of too many would lie dormant, and therefore wi&s;h to force them to pay. Here let it be noted; that there are many in the world, who believe, in con&s;cience, that a mini&s;ter is not entitled to any acknowledgement for his &s;ervices, without he is &s;o poor that he cannot live without it, (and thereby convert a go&s;pel debt to alms):&mdash; Though this opinion is not founded either on rea&s;on or &s;cripture; yet it is a better opinion than that which would force them to pay a preacher by hu|man law.</P>
<P N="4">IV. How mortifying mu&s;t it be to foreigners, and how far from conciliatory is it, to citizens of the American &s;tates, who, when they come into Connecticut to re&s;ide mu&s;t either conform to the religion of Connecticut, or produce a certificate? Does this look like religious liberty or human friend|&s;hip? Suppo&s;e that man (who&s;e name need not be mentioned) that fills every American heart with plea&s;ure and awe, &s;hould remove to Connecticut for his health, or any other cau&s;e&mdash;what a &s;candal would it be to the &s;tate, to tax him to a pre&s;byterian min|i&s;ter, unle&s;s he produced a certificate, informing them that he was an epi&s;copalian?</P>
<P N="5">V. The federal con&s;titution certainly had the advantage, of any of the &s;tate con&s;titutions, in being made by the wi&s;e&s;t men in the whole nation, and
<PB N="28" REF="023495_0027_0FBFA2A28515E910">
after an experiment of a number of years trial, upon republican principles: and that con&s;titution forbids congre&s;s ever to e&s;tabli&s;h any kind of religion, or require any religious te&s;t to qualify any officer in any department of federal government. Let a man be Pagan, Turk, Jew or Chri&s;tian, he is eligible to any po&s;t in that government. So that if the prin|ciples of religious liberty, contended for in the fore|going pages, are &s;uppo&s;ed to be fraught with dei&s;m, fourteen &s;tates, in union, are now fraught with the &s;ame. But the &s;eparate &s;tates have not &s;urrendered that (&s;uppo&s;ed) right of e&s;tabli&s;hing religion, to Congre&s;s. Each &s;tate retains all its power, &s;aving what is given to the general government, by the federal con&s;titution. The a&s;&s;embly of Connecticut, therefore, &s;till undertake to guide the helm of re|ligion: and if Congre&s;s were di&s;po&s;ed&punc; yet they could not prevent it, by any power ve&s;ted in them by the &s;tates. Therefore, if any of the people of Connecticut feel oppre&s;&s;ed by the certificate law, or any other of the like nature, their proper mode of procedure will be to remon&s;trate again&s;t the op|pre&s;&s;ion, and petition the a&s;&s;embly for a redre&s;s of grievance.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Divines generally inform us, that there is &s;uch a time to come (called the <HI>Latter-Day Glory),</HI> when the knowledge of the Lord &s;hall cover the earth as the waters do the &s;ea: and that this day will appear upon the de&s;truction of antichri&s;t: If &s;o, I am well convinced that Je&s;us will fir&s;t remove all the hindrances of religious e&s;tabli&s;hments, and
<PB N="29" REF="023495_0028_0FBFA2A40213B148">
cau&s;e all men to be free in matters of religion.&mdash; When this is effected, he will &s;ay to the kings and great men of the earth, <Q>Now &s;ee what I can do: ye have been afraid to leave the church and go&s;|pel in my hands alone, without &s;teadying the ark by human law; but now I have taken the power and kingdom to my&s;elf; and will work for my own glory.</Q>&mdash;Here let me add, that in the &s;outhern &s;tates, where there has been the greate&s;t freedom from religious oppre&s;&s;ion; where liberty of con&s;cience is entirely enjoyed; there has been the greate&s;t revival of religion; which is an|other proof that true religion can, and will prevail be&s;t, where it is left entirely to Chri&s;t.</P>
