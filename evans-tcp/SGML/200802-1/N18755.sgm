<HEAD>A CHARGE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>DEARLY and well beloved Brethren of the African Lodge, as through the goodne&s;s and mercy of God, we are once more met toge|ther, in order to celebrate the Fe&s;tival of St. John the Bapti&s;t; it is requi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> that we &s;hould on the&s;e public days, and when we appear in form, give &s;ome rea&s;on as a foundation for our &s;o doing, but as this has been already done, in a di&s;cour&s;e deli|vered in &s;ub&s;tance by our late Reverend Brother <HI>John Marrant,</HI> and now in print,</P>
<P>I &s;hall at this time endeavour to rai&s;e part of the &s;uper&s;tructure, for how&s;oever good the foun|dation may be, yet without this it will only prove a Babel. I &s;hall therefore endeavour to &s;hew the duty of a Ma&s;on; and the fir&s;t thing is, that he believes in one &s;upreme Being, that he is the great Architect of this vi&s;ible world, and that he governs all things here below by his almigh|ty power, and his watchful eye is over all our works. Again we mu&s;t be good &s;ubjects to the laws of the land in which we dwell, giving ho|nour to our lawful Governors and Magi&s;trates, giving honour to whom honour is due; and that we have no hand in any plots or con&s;piracies or rebellion, or &s;ide or a&s;&s;i&s;t in them: for when we con&s;ider the blood&s;hed, the deva&s;tation of towns and cities that hath been done by them, what heart can be &s;o hard as not to pity tho&s;e our
<PB N="4" REF="024374_0003_0FC62415C842A790">
di&s;tre&s;t brethren, and keep at the greate&s;t di&s;tance from them. However ju&s;t it may be on the &s;ide of the oppre&s;t, yet it doth not in the lea&s;t, or rather ought not, abate that love and fellow-feel|ing which we ought to have for our brother fel|low men.</P>
<P>The next thing is love and benevolence to all the whole family of mankind, as God's make and creation, therefore we ought to love them all, for love or hatred is of the whole kind, for if I love a man for the &s;ake of the image of God which is on him, I mu&s;t love all, for he made all, and upholds all, and we are dependant upon him for all we do enjoy and expect to enjoy in this world and that which is to come.&mdash;Therefore he will help and a&s;&s;i&s;t all his fellow-men in di&s;tre&s;s, let them be of what colour or nation they may, yea even our very enemies, much more a brother Ma&s;on. I &s;hall therefore give you a few in&s;tan|ces of this from Holy Writ, and fir&s;t, how did Abraham prevent the &s;torm, or rebellion that was ri&s;ing between Lot's &s;ervants and his? Saith Abraham to Lot, let there be no &s;trife I pray thee between me and thee, for the land is before us, if you will go to the left, then I will go to the right, and if you will go to the right, then I will go to the left. They divided and peace was re|&s;tored. I will mention the compa&s;&s;ion of a black|man to a Prophet of the Lord, Ebedmelech, when he heard that Jeremiah was ca&s;t into the dungeon, he made interce&s;&s;ion for him to the
<PB N="5" REF="024374_0004_0FC6241835C7C2E0">
King and got liberty to take him out from the jaws of death. See Jer. xxxviii 7-13.</P>
<P>Al&s;o the prophet Eli&s;ha after he had led the army of the Framites blindfold into Samaria, when the King in a deriding manner &s;aid, my <HI>Father</HI> (not con&s;idering that he was as much their Father as his) &s;hall I &s;mite, or rather kill them out of the way, as not worthy to live on the &s;ame earth, or draw the &s;ame air with him|&s;elf; &s;o eager was he to &s;hed his brethren's blood, that he repeats his blood-thir&s;ty demand, but the Prophet after reproaching him therefor, an&s;wers him no, but &s;et bread and water before them; or in other words, give them a fea&s;t and let them go home in peace. See 2 Kings, vi.22.23.</P>
<P>I &s;hall ju&s;t mention the good deeds of the Sa|maritan, though at that time they were looked upon as unworthy to eat, drink or trade with their fellow-men, at lea&s;t by the Jews; &s;ee the pity and compa&s;&s;ion he had on a poor di&s;tre&s;t and half dead &s;tranger, &s;ee Luke x. from 30 to 37. See that you endeavour to do &s;o likewi&s;e.&mdash;But when we con&s;ider the amazing conde&s;cending love and pity our ble&s;&s;ed Lord had on &s;uch poor worms as we are, as not only to call us his friends, but his brothers, we are lo&s;t and can go no further in holy writ for examples to excite us to the love of our fellow-men.&mdash;But I am aware of an objection that may ari&s;e (for &s;ome men will catch at any thing) that is that they were not all Ma&s;ons, we allow it, and I &s;ay that they
<PB N="6" REF="024374_0005_0FC624196C463A80">
were not all Chri&s;tians, and their benevolence to &s;trangers ought to &s;hame us both, that there is &s;o little, &s;o very little of it to be &s;een in the&s;e en|lightened days.</P>
<P>Another thing which is the duty of a Ma&s;on is, that he pays a &s;trict regard to the &s;tated meet|ings of the Lodge, for ma&s;onry is of a progre&s;&s;ive nature, and mu&s;t be attended to if ever he in|tends to be a good Ma&s;on; for the man that thinks that becau&s;e he hath been made a Ma&s;on, and is called &s;o, and at the &s;ame time will wil|fully neglect to attend his Lodge, he may be a&s;|&s;ured he will never make a good Ma&s;on, nor ought he to be looked upon as a good member of the craft. For if his example was followed, where would be the Lodge; and be&s;ides what a di&s;grace is it, when we are at our &s;et meetings, to hear that one of our members is at a drinking hou&s;e, or at a card table, or in &s;ome wor&s;e com|pany, this brings di&s;grace on the Craft: Again there are &s;ome that attend the Lodge in &s;uch a manner that &s;ometimes their ab&s;ence would be better than their Company (I would not here be under&s;tood a brother in di&s;gui&s;e, for &s;uch an one hath no bu&s;ine&s;s on a level floor) for if he hath been di&s;plea&s;ed abroad or at home, the lea&s;t thing that is &s;poken that he thinks not right, or in the lea&s;t offends him, he will rai&s;e his temper to &s;uch a height as to de&s;troy the harmony of the whole Lodge; but we have a remedy and every officer ought to &s;ee it put in execution.&mdash;
<PB N="7" REF="024374_0006_0FC624206D6A7AE8">
Another thing a Ma&s;on ought to ob&s;erve, is that he &s;hould lend his helping hand to a brother in di&s;tre&s;s, and relieve him, this we may do various ways; for we may &s;ometimes help him to a cup of cold water, and it may be better to him than a cup of wine. Good advice may be &s;ometimes better than feeding his body, helping him to &s;ome lawful employment, better than giving him money; &s;o defending his ca&s;e and &s;tanding by him when wrongfully accu&s;ed, may be better than cloathing him; better to &s;ave a brother's hou&s;e when on fire, than to give him one. Thus much may &s;uffice.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now cite &s;ome of our fore-fathers, for our imitation: and the fir&s;t &s;hall be Tertullian, who defended the Chri&s;tians again&s;t their heathen fal&s;e accu&s;ations, whom they charged with trea&s;on again&s;t the empire and the Emperor, becau&s;e of their &s;ilent meetings: he proved that to be fal&s;e for this rea&s;on, for in their meetings, they were wont to pray for the pro&s;perity of the Empire, of Rome, and him al&s;o; and they were accu&s;ed of being enemies to mankind, how can that be, &s;aid he, when their office is to love and pray for all mankind. When they were charged with wor&s;hipping the Sun, becau&s;e they looked to|wards the Ea&s;t when they prayed; he defended them again&s;t this &s;lander al&s;o, and proved that they were &s;landered, &s;lighted and ill-treated, not for any de&s;ert of theirs, but only out of hatred of them and their profe&s;&s;ion.&mdash;This friend of the
<PB N="8" REF="024374_0007_0FC62422F21F0630">
di&s;tre&s;t was born in Carthage in Africa, and died Anno Chri&s;ti, 202.</P>
<P>Take another of the &s;ame city, Cyprian, for his fidelity to his profe&s;&s;ion was &s;uch, that he would rather &s;uffer death than betray his tru&s;t and the truth of the go&s;pel, or approve of the impious wor&s;hip of the Gentiles: He was not only Bi&s;hop of Carthage, but of Spain and the ca&s;t, we&s;t and northern churches, who died anno Chri&s;ti, 259.</P>
<P>But I have not time to cite but one more (out of hundreds that I could count of our Fa|thers, who were not only examples to us, but to many of their nobles and learned,) that is Au|gu&s;tine, who had engraven on his table the&s;e words</P>
<P>He that doth love an ab&s;ent Friend to jeer,</P>
<P>May hence depart no room is for him here.</P>
<P>His &s;aying was that &s;incere and upright Prayer pierceth heaven, and returns not empty. That it was a &s;helter to the &s;oul. A &s;acrifice to God and a &s;courge to the Devil. There is nothing, &s;aid he, more abateth pride and &s;in than the frequent meditation on death he cannot die ill, that lives well; and &s;eldom doth he die well, that lives ill: Again, if men want wealth, it is not to be un|ju&s;tly gotten, if they have it they ought by good works to lay it up in heaven: And again, he that hath ta&s;ted the &s;weetne&s;s of divine love, will not care for temporal &s;weetne&s;s. The rea&s;onable &s;oul made in the likene&s;s of God, may here find much di&s;traction, but no full &s;atisfaction; not to be
<PB N="9" REF="024374_0008_0FC62423F1B4ABA0">
without afflictions, but to overcome them is ble&s;&s;edne&s;s. Love is as &s;trong as death; as death kills the body, &s;o love of eternal life kills world|ly, de&s;ires and affections. He called Ingratitude the Devil's &s;punge, wherewith he wipes out all the favours of the Almighty. His prayer was, Lord give fir&s;t what thou require&s;t, and then re|quire of me what thou wilt.&mdash;This good man died anno Chr&s;ti, 430.&mdash;</P>
<P>The next is Fulgentius, his &s;peech was, why travel I in the world which can yield me no fu|ture, nor durable reward, an&s;werable to my pains. Thought it better to weep well, than to rejoice ill, yet if joy be our de&s;ire, how much more ex|cellent is their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, who have a good con&s;cience before God, who dread nothing but &s;in, &s;tudy to do nothing but to accompli&s;h the precepts of Chri&s;t. Now therefore let me change my cour&s;e, and as before I endeavoured among&s;t my noble friends, to prove more noble, &s;o now let my care and employment be among the humble and poor &s;ervants of Chri&s;t and become more humble that I may help and in&s;truct my poor and di&s;tre&s;t brethren.</P>
<P>Thus my brethren I have quoted a few of your reverend fathers, for your imitation, which I hope you endeavour to follow, &s;o far as your abili<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> permit in your pre&s;ent &s;itua|tion and the di&s;advantages you labour under on account of your being deprived of the means of education in your younger days, as you &s;ee it is
<PB N="10" REF="024374_0009_0FC6242634B2AD48">
at this day with our children, for we &s;ee not|with&s;tanding we are rared for that, and other Town charges, we are deprived of that ble&s;&s;ing. But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> di&s;couraged have patience, and look forward to a better day: Hear what the great Architect of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> world <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aith. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iopia &s;hall &s;tretch forth her hands <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> al&s;o the &s;trange, but bold and co&s;ider language of <HI>J.

Make you this beginning, and who knows but God may rai&s;e up &s;ome friend of body of friends, as he did in <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> to open a School for the blacks here, as that friendly city has done there.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now &s;hew you what progre&s;s ma&s;onry hath made &s;ince the the &s;iege, and taking of Jeru&s;a|lem in the year 70, by Titus Ve&s;pa&s;ian, after a long, and bloody &s;iege, a million of &s;ouls having been &s;lain, or had peri&s;hed and the eity, it was taken by &s;torm and the city &s;et on fire. There was an order of men called the order of St. John, who besides their other engagements, &s;ub&s;cribe to another, by which they bound theme&s;lves to keep up the war again&s;t the Turks, the&s;e men defended the temple when on fire, in order to &s;ave it, &s;o long, that Titus was amazed and went to &s;ee the rea&s;on of it; but when he came &s;o
<PB N="11" REF="024374_0010_0FC6242795D245F0">
near as to behold the <HI>Sanctum Sanctorum,</HI> he was amazed, and &s;hed tears, and &s;aid, no wonder the&s;e men &s;hould &s;o long to &s;ave it. He honor|ed them with many honors, and large contribu|tions were made to that order from many king|doms; and were al&s;o knighted. They continu|ed 88 years in Jeru&s;alem, till that city was again retaken by the Turks, after which they re&s;ided 104 years in the Cyrean city of Ptolemy, till the remains of the Holy Conque&s;t were lo&s;t. Where|upon they &s;ettled on the I&s;land of Cyprus, where they continued 18 years, till they found an op|portunity to take the I&s;land Rhodes, being ma&s;|ters of that they maintained it for 213 years, and from thence they were called knights of Rhodes, till in the year 1530, they took their re&s;idence in the Is&s;land of Malta, where they have continued to this day, and are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of the knights of Malta. Their fir&s;t Ma&s;ter was Villaret in the year 1099. Fulco Villaret in the year 1322, took the I&s;land of Rhodes, and was after that di&s;tingui&s;hed by the title of Grand-Ma&s;ter, which hath devolved to his Succe&s;&s;ors to this day.</P>
<P>Query, Whether at that day, when there was an African church, and perhaps the large&s;t Chri&s;tian church on earth, whether there was no African of that order; or whether, if they were all whites, they would refu&s;e to accept them as their fellow Chri&s;tians and brother Ma&s;ons; or whether there were any &s;o weak, or
<PB N="12" REF="024374_0011_0FC6242AAD977A70">
rather &s;o fooli&s;h, as to &s;ay, becau&s;e they were Blacks, that would make their lodge or army too common or too cheap? Sure this was not our conduct in the late war; for then they marched &s;houlder to &s;houlder, brother &s;oldier and brother &s;oldier, to the field of battle; let who will an|&s;wer; he that de&s;pi&s;es a black man for the &s;ake of his colour, reproacheth his Maker, and he hath re&s;ented it, in the ca&s;e of Aaron and Miriam. See for this Numbers xii.&mdash;</P>
<P>But to return: In the year 1787 (the year in which we received our charter) there were 489 lodges under charge of his late Royal High|ne&s;s the Duke of Cumberland; who&s;e memory will always be e&s;teemed by every good Ma&s;on.</P>
<P>And now, my African brethren, you &s;ee what a noble order you are members of. My charge to you is, that you make it your &s;tudy to live up to the precepts of it&punc; as you know that they are all good; and let it be known this day to the &s;pectat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rs, that you have not been to a fea&s;t of Bacchus, but to a refre&s;hment with Ma&s;ons; and &s;ee to it that you behave as &s;uch, as well at home as abroad; always to keep in your minds the obligations you are under, both to God and your fellow men&punc; And more &s;o, you my dear brethren of Providence, who are at a di&s;tance from, and cannot attend the Lodge here but &s;eldom; yet I hope you will en|deavour to communicate to us by letters of your welfare; and remember your obligations to each

other, and live in peace and love as brethren&mdash; We thank you for your attendance with us this day, and with you a &s;afe return.</P>
<P>If thus, we by the grace of God, live up to this our Pro&s;e&s;&s;ion; we may cheerfully go the rounds of the compa&s;s of this life. Having lived according to the plumb line of uprightne&s;s, the &s;quare of ju&s;tice, the level truth and &s;incerity. And when we are come to the end of time, we may then bid farewell to that delightful Sun and Moon, and the other planets, that move &s;o beau|tifully round her in their orbits, and all things here below, and a&s;eend to that new Jeru&s;alem, where we &s;hall not want the&s;e tapers, for God is the Light thereof; where the Wicked cca&s;e from troubling, and where the weary are at re&s;t</P>
