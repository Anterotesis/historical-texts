<P>I Have a ju&s;t Claim to thy utmo&s;t Candour, and am blamele&s;s, what fault &s;oever there may be in this Publick Appearance; except it be a Fault to yield unto <HI>Tho&s;e</HI> who would take no Denyal, who&s;e Per&s;ons both by Inclination &amp; Duty, I love and honour, and to who&s;e Advice I owe a great deference. Po&s;&s;ibly I have gone beyond the Rules of Decency in the ob&s;tinate Excu&s;es I have made, if it might have been to avoid both the Preaching and Publi&s;hing the following <HI>Di&s;|cour&s;e.</HI> But I am Over-ruled: and only entreat on the one hand, that the <HI>Gentlemen</HI> who have pre&s;t me to this Service would not judge my back|wardne&s;s to comply with their re&s;pectful de&s;ires; nor on the other hand the <HI>Reader</HI> my weakne&s;s in Emitting a <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e</HI> with &s;o many Defects; as I mu&s;t needs own I &s;ee in <HI>this,</HI> &amp; yet could not &s;up|ply without making it anew, &amp; &s;welling it too big.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s the <HI>Subject</HI> &s;eems to me well cho&s;en &amp; &s;ea&s;onable, were the management an&s;werable. A &s;erious Call to the Exerci&s;e of <HI>Faith</HI> can never be un&s;uitable to a Chri&s;tian People: but peculiarly pro|per is it in &s;uch a Calamitous Day as this; a Day of Di&s;tre&s;s to the whole Prote&s;tant World.

to this <HI>Duty</HI>: and at times his Providence has the &s;ame voice, and loudly tells us &mdash; when it is e&s;pecially the Duty of the pre&s;ent Day</P>
<P>I hope the <HI>Reader</HI> will not expect here an E&s;say to un|fold the Doctrine of Faith, as it lies in the Body of Christi|an Religion: that would require a Volumn by it &s;elf, &amp; a more ma&s;terly hand to draw it Wherefore I have not attempted to con&s;ider it any further than in its stricte&s;t connexion to the Character &amp; Duties of <HI>Souldiers</HI>: &amp; even as to them I have but given hints, &amp; left the un|derstanding Chri&s;tian to infer more of his Duty.</P>

<P>May it plea&s;e God to give us all a mo&s;t affectionate Regard, and deep Concern for the Pro&s;perity of his Church: And may he make this poor <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e,</HI> by his Grace accompanying it, to Sub&s;erve hereunto, by putting us more on <HI>Faith and Prayer.</HI></P>

<P>THE Power of Great and Ex|cellent <HI>Examples</HI> is &s;o con|fe&s;&s;ed by all men, that <HI>they have gain'd</HI> the preference to other modes of In&s;truction, both for Facility and Efficacy: they are more ea&s;ily perceived, and do more power|fully incline to practice, than bare <HI>Precepts:</HI> they in&s;inuate into the minds of men, and leave very &s;trong Impre&s;&s;ions there.

the evil practices of others, as <HI>Noah</HI> did the Old World; and bind us to imitate, leaving us &s;teps which we ought to follow.

<HEAD><HI>DOCTRINE.</HI> That the Victories which the People of God have gain'd, or the Salvations and Deliverances they have received from their Enemies in this World, may under God nextly and principally be a&s;cribed to their Faith.</HEAD>
<P>The Doctrine contains &s;everal di&s;tinct Truths. As,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That the Church and People of God have Enemies in the World, and are often unavoidably engaged in cruel War.</HI> War is very far di&s;tant from the De&s;ign and Spirit of the Go&s;pel of Peace; but yet the pre&s;ent evil world nece&s;|&s;arily renders the State of the Church Mili|tant. Not that the Religion of Chri&s;t pro|pagates it &s;elf by Fire and Sword, by Force and Blood &s;hed: Let Impo&s;tors wear that brand, and bloody. <HI>Mahomes,</HI> force down the throats of his Pro&s;elites that with the re&s;t of his &s;hameful Doctrines. The rea&s;on is, be|cau&s;e the Kingdom of Chri&s;t is Spiritual, and not of this world: for &s;aid our Lord to <HI>Pi|late,</HI> Joh. 18.36. <HI>If my Kingdom were of this world, then would my Servants fight</HI>; then would they propagate the Faith by violence and force of Arms. Yet however, the Church of Chri&s;t is in an evil world, full of
<PB N="6" REF="001042_0009_0FAEECE0FA627CC8">
&s;in, and con&s;equently full of confu&s;ion and mi&s;ery, the fruit of &s;in: and <HI>hence come wars and fightings</HI> even <HI>of</HI> mens <HI>lu&s;ts</HI>; which fill them with enmity one again&s;t another, but e&s;pecially again&s;t God and his Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>It would be too great an excur&s;ion here to Enquire, <HI>In what Ca&s;es a Chri&s;tian State</HI> (which is al&s;o a Church of Chri&s;t) <HI>may Wage War?</HI> I &s;hall only &s;ay, That to be &s;ure the <HI>Lu&s;t of Dominion,</HI> whether temporal or &s;piritual; whether over mens civil proper|ties and liberties, or over mens con&s;ciences, doth &s;ufficiently authorize it. Which is in|deed the very thing that fills the World with the noi&s;e and rumour of War at this day, the thir&s;t of an in&s;atiable Prince to in|&s;lave the world, and &s;tretch all mens con&s;ci|ences to his own &s;ize: the very Menace whereof will ju&s;tifie the Confederacy again&s;t any &s;uch baneful Power, not only as ju&s;t, but al&s;o pious and nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another Truth implyed in the Doct|rine is, <HI>That the People of God always have been, and will be finally victorious over their Enemies, and &s;aved from them.</HI> Not that Succe&s;s always waits on the ju&s;t &s;ide, or that in particular Wars or Conflicts, God does not often give the victory to his own and his peoples Enemies. Nay particular branch|es
<PB N="7" REF="001042_0010_0FAEECE5185EFBB0">
of the Church, even whole Nations may be given as a prey to their teeth; and it has been at that pa&s;s, that there has been no appearance of a true I&s;raelite left; &s;o that <HI>Elijah</HI> thought he had rea&s;on for that bitter complaint, 1 King. 19.10. <HI>I</HI>&punc; even <HI>I only am left, and they &s;eek my life, to take it away.</HI></P>
<P>Yet neverthele&s;s, the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Intere&s;t of God hath always out liv'd &s;uch Oppre&s;&s;ions and &s;eeming Extirpations. There nave been <HI>Re&s;erves,</HI> who&s;e <HI>knees have not bow'd to Baal,</HI> nor with <HI>their mouths</HI> have they <HI>ki&s;&s;ed</HI> his I|mage. Whom the Grace of God has kept, and his Providence guarded po&s;&s;ibly even from the &s;u&s;picion of retaining their Inte|grity; and at long run the&s;e poor Remains have &s;een the ruine of their proud Oppre&s;|&s;ors, and trampled on the Power that once tyranized over them. Let Antichri&s;tian Ty|rants boa&s;t that they have made through work of it, and that their next Succe&s;&s;ors &s;hall &s;carce know what the name of a <HI>Hugo|not</HI> means; yet God may have many <HI>Names</HI> there, whom we may name in a double &s;ence his Invi&s;ible Church, who have not defiled their Garments, while the world wanders after the Bea&s;t. Thus it was in the tenth and la&s;t general Per&s;ecution of the Church, under <HI>Diocle&s;ian,</HI> and &s;ome of his Succe&s;&s;ors: So incredible numbers of Chri&s;tians were Mar|tyred,
<PB N="8" REF="001042_0011_0FAEECE6556979D0">
that the&s;e Pagan Emperors thought their work compleated, &amp; in an ancient In&s;cription they tell the World, <Q>That they had effac'd the name and &s;uper&s;tition of Chri&s;tians, and re&s;to|red the Wor&s;hip of the Gods: i. e. <HI>the Pa|gan Idolatries. But as Chri&s;tian Hi&s;torians have well ob&s;erved,</HI> 'They were &s;o much de|ceived, that this only ha&s;tened the de&s;truction of Pagani&s;m, and &s;hortly after Chri&s;tianity be|came victorious and triumphant over all the Powers and Artifices of Mankind.</Q></P>
<P>The foes of Chri&s;t will be made his foot-&s;tool; and let them <HI>rage</HI> and <HI>imagine</HI> what they will; their &s;pite and their coun&s;el He has equally <HI>in deri&s;ion; He will break them with a rod of iron, and da&s;h them in pieces like a potters ve&s;&s;el.</HI> So <HI>Daniel</HI> prophe&s;ies of the Everla&s;ting Kingdom of Chri&s;t, Dan. 2.44. &mdash;<HI>The God of Heaven &s;hall &s;et up a Kingdom which &s;hall never be destroyed; and the King|dom &s;hall not be left to other people,</HI> but it <HI>&s;hall break in pieces and con&s;ume all the&s;e Kingdoms, and it &s;hall &s;tand for ever.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Another truth contained in the Doct|rine is, <HI>That to God ultimately are all the Church her Salvations and Victories to be a&s;cribed.</HI> Not to Means nor In&s;truments, not to power nor policies, not to courage nor conduct: for as <HI>the whole Di&s;po&s;al</HI> of every thing is of the Lord, &s;o we can't a&s;cribe it to any le&s;&s;er
<PB N="9" REF="001042_0012_0FAEECE6D80CE410">
cau&s;e, without denying God and his govern|ing Providence, and placing our &s;elves in Gods &s;tead. An arrogance which even <HI>Hea|thens</HI> have condemned and abhorred, who tho' they had very wretched Ideas of God, yet dur&s;t they not deny this Honour to their lame <HI>Deities.</HI> So the <HI>Hi&s;torian</HI> tells us of the brave <HI>Timoleon,</HI> <Q>That he did always mode&s;t|ly a&s;cribe all his Succe&s;&s;es to the Sole favour of Providence, and would be often &s;aying, <HI>that he was very thankful to God, who having a mind to pre&s;erve</HI> Sicily, <HI>was plea&s;ed to ho|nour him with the Name and Title of that De|liverance he vouch&s;afed it.</HI> And yet this Su|per&s;titious <HI>Warriour</HI> had no better Notion of a Deity, than having built a Chappel in his hou&s;e, he dedicated it unto <HI>Good Hap,</HI> and Sacrific'd thereunto as to &s;ome Sacred <HI>Genius</HI> that favour'd him.</Q> And yet verily this ridiculous Super&s;tition of a blind Heathen will judge the profane Chri&s;tian, who know|ing more of God and his Providence, yet le&s;s reverences and honours him.</P>
<P>We read of <HI>Con&s;tantine the Great,</HI> that upon the fir&s;t Conviction he received of the truth of Chri&s;tianity, he caus'd a Royal Standard <Q>to be made in fa&s;hion of a Cro&s;s, and to be born before him in his Wars, as an En&s;ign of Victory and Safety: and when he had re&s;cued mi&s;erable <HI>Rome</HI> from the Tyranny
<PB N="10" REF="001042_0013_0FAEECE79011A9A8">
of <HI>Maxentius,</HI> and was Saluted by the Peo|ple in the &s;tyle of <HI>their Father, their Saviour, and the Author of all their Happine&s;s,</HI> he taught them to a&s;cribe all to God alone, and attribute nothing to him. Moreover, in the right hand of the <HI>Statues,</HI> that were erected to his Honour by Decree of Senate, he caus'd to be engraven the figure of the Cro&s;s, with this In&s;cription on it, <HI>In this Overcome</HI></Q> Which action, however dange|rous in its Con&s;equence, leading to Gro&s;s Su|per&s;titions, yet carries this In&s;truction in it too, That the Chri&s;tian Warriour is to expect all his Victories from, and to a&s;cribe all he gains unto, his <HI>Almighty and once Crucified Re|deemer.</HI></P>
<P>The Holy Scripture abounds with many plain A&s;&s;ertions to this purpo&s;e; teaching us, <HI>That the Race is not to the &s;wift, nor the Battel to the &s;trong: The Hor&s;e is prepared again&s;t the day of Battel, but &s;afety is of the Lord,</HI> Prov. 21.31. <HI>That there is no King &s;aved by the mul|titude of an Ho&s;t: a Mighty man is not delivered by much &s;trength: A Hor&s;e is a vain thing for &s;afety, &amp;c</HI> P&s;al. 33.16, 17. We therefore find <HI>David</HI> after all his Victories giving the honour of them all to God, <HI>Thine, O Lord, is the Greatne&s;s, and the Power, and the Glory, and the Victory, and the Maje&s;ty</HI>: And &s;o <HI>I&s;rael</HI> on the banks of the Red Sea triumph in their Sa|viour,
<PB N="11" REF="001042_0014_0FAEECE85186C930">
<HI>I will &s;ing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriou&s;ly; The Lord</HI> is <HI>my Strength and Song and he is become my Salvation: The Lord</HI> is <HI>a Man of War, the Lord</HI> is <HI>his Name.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. And la&s;tly, The la&s;t and chief truth to be in&s;i&s;ted on is, <HI>That nextly and principally under God, the Church her Salvations &amp; Victories, may be a&s;cribed to Faith.</HI> So in the <HI>Text, who through Faith &s;ubdued Kingdoms.</HI></P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary that this be <HI>fir&s;t</HI> proved as to matter of Fact, and that we <HI>then</HI> enquire whence Faith receives this Power &amp; Efficacy.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>It is a matter of Fact a&s;&s;erted; and it is to be proved by Te&s;timony</HI>; and this from the Record and Hi&s;tory of the Churches Wars, e&s;pecially that part of them which is tran&s;mit|ted to us by God Him&s;elf, in the Holy Scrip|ture. Which do afford us many plain In|&s;tances of the Power and Prevalency of Faith, in the Victories which the people of God have from time to time gain'd over the Enemies of God. To name a few in the Order wherein they ly in Scripture.</P>
<P>The Salvation and Victory of <HI>I&s;rael at the Red Sea,</HI> was the fruit of Faith: <HI>v.</HI> 29. <HI>By Faith they pa&s;&s;ed through the Red-Sea, as by dry</HI> Land; <HI>which the Egyptians a&s;&s;aying to do were drowned.</HI> On the Bank of the Flood &s;tood

the Believing Prophet, and i&s;&s;ued out this only Order to the Army of I&s;rael, <HI>Stand &s;till and &s;ee the Salvation of the Lord, which he will &s;hew to you to day:</HI> This was all they had to do in this famous Overthrow of <HI>Pharaoh</HI> and his Ho&s;ts; to wait upon God with a quiet com|po&s;ed frame of Spirit, and a believing expecta|tion of Deliverance.</P>
<P>What was it but Faith, that <HI>defeated Ama|leck</HI>? In vain did <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> fight below, when <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> in the Mount let down his Hand. The Rod of God in the hand of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> did more than all the Spears, Darts, and In&s;truments of War, wielded by the whole Army of I&s;rael.</P>

<P>I &s;hall <HI>Improve</HI> this Doctrine in one &s;ingle <HI>Inference,</HI> and &s;o clo&s;e in a <HI>brief Addre&s;s to the Honourable Company who have called us together.</HI></P>
<P>The only <HI>Inference</HI> I &s;hall offer, is, That we may hence learn <HI>one great rea&s;on of the poor Condition which the Intere&s;t of Chri&s;t in the World is fallen into at this day.</HI> Truly, the Church of Chri&s;t has lately been in &s;orrow|ful and bleeding circum&s;tances: the doleful cries of &s;uffering Saints have been loud, and &s;o have the Bla&s;phemies of their Oppre&s;&s;ors. What Convul&s;ions do the Nations at this day feel under the pre&s;ages of bloody War, and threatned with a deluge of <HI>Popery</HI>? The Re|formed Intere&s;t is far le&s;s potent, and at a lower ebb, than in Ages pa&s;t. And what may be the rea&s;on of this &s;ore frown of God upon his Intere&s;t? Alas, the rea&s;on is too vi|&s;ible, <HI>Faith, and the nece&s;&s;ary fruits of Faith are wanting.</HI> 'Tis partly through foul avow'd Apo&s;tacies from the Truth, and more thro' the general corruption of Manners among tho&s;e that retain a <HI>Form of Godline&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>Do you ask, <HI>Where are the Churches Victories

now</HI>? Where her Triumphs? Why does &s;he not Increa&s;e, and enlarge her Borders? And may I not as well ask again, (as I remember an excellent Per&s;on doth in a like ca&s;e) <HI>Where is Faith to be found in Exerci&s;e</HI>? Where are Believers? How cold and dead is our modern Profe&s;&s;ion? Can Faith be without Holine&s;s and good Works? or can it con&s;i&s;t with profanene&s;s, debaucheries, and every abomination? The&s;e are the Foes that lay wa&s;te the Heritage of God: <HI>The&s;e</HI> the fal&s;e Traitors that undermine the Church. The lu&s;ts of <HI>Profe&s;&s;ors</HI> are the wor&s;t Weapons formed again&s;t that Community which <HI>they</HI> pretend to be a part of; and &s;heathed with unnatural bruiti&s;hne&s;s in the bowels of their common Mother. No wonder <HI>Amaleck pre|vails,</HI> when there are &s;o few holy and <HI>clean hands lift up</HI> in the Mount. So that if the Church of Chri&s;t have lo&s;t ground in&s;tead of gaining, yet it argues not that Faith could not have rendered <HI>it</HI> victorious, and can yet do it: but it is rather a <HI>&s;hrewd &s;ign that Faith is wanting. Hear ye me</HI> Ala, <HI>and all</HI> Judah <HI>and</HI> Benjamin, <HI>The Lord is with you, while ye be with him; and if ye &s;eek him, he will be found of you; but if ye for&s;ake him, he will for&s;ake you.</HI></P>

<P>And having named this <HI>Royal Per&s;on,</HI> I cannot but call to mind the many Salvations and Victories, which Faith has obtained, and the Church of Chri&s;t has received, <HI>by His Arms.</HI> We our &s;elves have &s;een the &s;trange, and next to Miraculous, effects of Faith and Prayer in our days.

When Tyranny was trampling on the State, and Popery &s;tood ready to mount the Pulpit, when Law and Religion were forc'd to couch before the <HI>A&s;&s;umed Ab&s;olutene&s;s of the Court,</HI> and were Sold at a cheap price by Mercenary <HI>Judges.</HI> Dejected <HI>Britain</HI> then call'd for our dutiful Tears and Prayers, under ten thou&s;and O|mens of evil, and no door of Deliverance vi&s;ible.
