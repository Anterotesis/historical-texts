<HEAD>FACTS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the fir&s;t appearance, in this city, of the contagious malignant, pe&s;tilential or yellow fever, in 1793, the College of Phy&s;icians, agreeably to the principles of their in&s;titution, &s;anctioned by a charter from the legi&s;lature in 1789, have u&s;ed their be&s;t endeavours to check the progre&s;s and to guard again&s;t the future introduction of this dread|ful calamity. To the repeated applications made to them, by the different departments of the &s;tate government on the &s;ubject, they have ever paid a prompt and re&s;pectful attention, and they now con|ceive it a duty incumbent on them to publi&s;h a conci&s;e detail of their former proceedings, and to explain more fully their &s;entiments on the nature, origin and prevention of this fatal di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="034355_0003_0FFA6C8C01D5DD28">About the latter end of July and beginning of Augu&s;t 1793, a fever of a new and very alarming nature prevailed in this city. It fir&s;t appeared in Water &s;treet, between Mulberry and Sa&s;&s;afras &s;treets, and all the ca&s;es of this fever, were, for two or three weeks evidently traced to this particu|lar &s;pot. A con&s;iderable part of the city, North|ern Liberties and di&s;trict of Southwark became gradually infected, and it was not until the coming of the fro&s;t, that the di&s;ea&s;e &s;ub&s;ided, after having proved fatal to nearly five thou&s;and per&s;ons.</P>
<P>The peculiarity of the &s;ymptoms, the remarkable inefficacy of remedies generally u&s;ed for di&s;ea&s;es which commonly occur in the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on of the year, with &s;omewhat &s;imilar &s;ymptoms, its great mortality and contagious nature, &s;ufficiently evinc|ed, that a very unu&s;ual di&s;ea&s;e exi&s;ted among&s;t us; which was &s;oon di&s;covered to be what is called the Siam, in the French, and the Yellow Fever in the Briti&s;h We&s;t Indies.</P>
<P>The College met on the 25th day of Augu&s;t to con&s;ider what was nece&s;&s;ary for them to do on the occa&s;ion, and next day &s;ent to the Mayor of the city, <Q>Directions for preventing the further pro|gre&s;s of the malignant fever,</Q> which were pub|li&s;hed.
<PB N="5" REF="034355_0004_0FFC2359270F5808">
The&s;e directions may be &s;een at large in a pamphlet entitled, <Q>Proceedings of the College of Phy&s;icians of Philadelphia, relative to the preven|tion of the introduction and &s;preading of conta|gious di&s;ea&s;es,</Q> publi&s;hed in January 1798, con|taining a regular account of all that had been done by the College on the occa&s;ion. A copy of this publication was &s;ent to every member of the fede|ral and &s;tate legi&s;latures, and of the &s;elect and common council of the city. The&s;e directions plainly &s;hew that the College regarded the di&s;ea&s;e as highly contagious and malignant.</P>
<P>On the fifth day of November a letter was re|ceived from the Governor of the &s;tate, reque&s;ting information of the origin of the di&s;ea&s;e, the pre|cautions be&s;t calculated to prevent its recurrence, and the proper means to be pur&s;ued to purify the city from latent infection. The College entered into a careful inquiry on this &s;ubject, and although they met with many difficulties in the inve&s;tigation, difficulties which generally occur on &s;uch occa&s;ions, and the &s;olution of which would criminate tho&s;e per&s;ons who are more immediately concerned, and who are the be&s;t qualified to give the nece&s;&s;ary accounts, yet they obtained &s;ufficient information to offer the following an&s;wer to the Governor.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="034355_0005_0FFC23570833DA80"><Q>No in&s;tance has ever occurred, of the di&s;ea&s;e called the Yellow Fever, being generated in this city, or in any other part of this &s;tate, as far as we know; but there have been frequent in&s;tances of its having been imported, not only into this, but into other parts of North America, and pre|vailing there for a certain period of time; and from the ri&s;e, progre&s;s and nature of the malignant fever, which began to prevail here about the be|ginning of la&s;t Augu&s;t, and extended it&s;elf gradu|ally over a great part of the city, we are of opinion, that this di&s;ea&s;e was imported into Phila|delphia by &s;ome of the ve&s;&s;els which arrived in the port after the middle of July. This opinion we are further confirmed in by the various ac|counts we have received from the be&s;t authorities we could procure on the &s;ubject.</Q></P>
<P>The College al&s;o informed the Governor of the be&s;t means to purify the city from latent infection, and offered their &s;ervices to co-operate with the le|gi&s;lature in their endeavours to prevent, avert or remove the&s;e dangerous calamities.</P>
<P>On the &s;econd day of December 1794, a com|mittee of the College was appointed to con&s;ider the defects in the health-laws and to point out a pro|per
<PB N="7" REF="034355_0006_0FFC23531FD56618">
remedy. On the report of this committee it was re&s;olved, that a memorial on the &s;ubject &s;hould be pre&s;ented to the &s;tate legi&s;lature, which was done accordingly, January 26th, 1795. The prin|cipal objects of this memorial were, a reque&s;t that medical characters might be appointed to a&s;&s;i&s;t the con&s;ulting phy&s;ician of the port to prevent the &s;preading of contagious di&s;ea&s;es when introduced among&s;t us, and to authorize them to remove the di&s;ea&s;ed and tho&s;e expo&s;ed to contagion. Al&s;o that they &s;hould be con&s;ulted re&s;pecting the quarantine and purification of ve&s;&s;els, and the con&s;truction and regulation of the city ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>So much attention was paid to this memorial that the legi&s;lature, in the new health-law, pa&s;&s;ed this &s;e&s;&s;ion, empowered the Governor to appoint four per&s;ons, members of the College, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the con|&s;ulting phy&s;ician as recommended, who were ac|cordingly appointed in Augu&s;t following, and were invited to hold one meeting with the Board of Health; but another law was pa&s;&s;ed the &s;ucceeding &s;e&s;&s;ion which excluded them from any further &s;hare in the bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>About the latter end of July 1797, the malig|nant contagious fever again appeared in Philadel|phia:
<PB N="8" REF="034355_0007_0FFC234F9152EBD8">
and on the fifteenth of Augu&s;t a letter was re|ceived from the Governor reque&s;ting information concerning its exi&s;tence, and <Q>an opinion on the be&s;t mode of preventing the calamity threatened.</Q> The College immediately directed, their Pre&s;ident to inform the Governor that &s;uch a di&s;ea&s;e had lately ap|peared in Penn-&s;treet and its neighbourhood, and on the &s;eventeenth of the month, in a letter to the Governor, gave their opinion of the be&s;t mode of averting the threatened calamity, by fir&s;t, pre&s;crib|ing the methods for preventing the &s;preading of con|tagious di&s;ea&s;es when introduced, and &s;econdly, by preventing their introduction.</P>
<P>To attain the fir&s;t of the&s;e purpo&s;es, they recom|mended &s;trict attention to cleaning and watering the &s;treets, habits of temperance, attention to cloathing, exerci&s;e, &amp;c. to avoid intercour&s;e with the &s;ick, and to purify places &s;u&s;pected or occupied by the &s;ick.</P>
<P>For the &s;econd purpo&s;e they recommended, a new law on the &s;ubject, which will be hereafter recurred to. See next page.</P>
<P>On the twenty-&s;econd day of Augu&s;t the Board of Health reque&s;ted the College to adopt and publi&s;h &s;uch advice as would tend to check the progre&s;s of
<PB N="9" REF="034355_0008_0FFC234E05E3B0C0">
The College, accordingly on the twen|ty-fifth, furni&s;hed the board with their &s;entiments on the &s;ubject. Their plan con&s;i&s;ted, generally, in &s;eparating the &s;ick from the well, great attention to cleanline&s;s, free admi&s;&s;ion of air, purification of bed|ding, cloathing, &amp;c. by expo&s;ing them to the &s;moke of charcoal and &s;ulphur in clo&s;e rooms, the free u&s;e of lime and cold water, and the application of the vapor produced by mixing oil of vitriol and &s;alt petre, in &s;ick rooms.</P>
<P>October 30th, a letter was read from the Govern|or of the &s;tate reque&s;ting to know <Q>what mea&s;ures ought to be pur&s;ued to purify the city from any la|tent infection, and what precautions were be&s;t cal|culated to guard again&s;t the future recurrence of a &s;imilar calamity.</Q> On the &s;eventh day of No|vember a full an&s;wer to the Governor's letter was agreed on and communicated to him. This letter is here introduced as giving more fully the &s;en&s;e of the College on this very intere&s;ting &s;ubject.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>We have duly con&s;idered your letter of the 24th ult. and &s;hall cheerfully comply with the requi&s;itions contained therein.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="034355_0009_0FFC224D91CF3440">The mea&s;ures to be pur&s;ued for purifying the city from any latent infection, are &s;uch as we have hereto|fore recommended, viz.&mdash;A &s;trict attention to clean|line&s;s, wa&s;hing, white-wa&s;hing, and ventilating the infected hou&s;es, bedding and cloathing; and fumi|gating them with charcoal and &s;ulphur, or a mixture of oil of vitriol and &s;alt-petre. The&s;e, with the fro&s;t, we believe, will be found &s;ufficient entirely to de|&s;troy any latent contagion.</P>
<P>But the latter part of your inquiry, viz. What precautions are be&s;t calculated to guard again&s;t the future occurrence of a &s;imilar calamity, is an object of &s;uch magnitude, as to demand a more particular reply.</P>
<P>We have, on former occa&s;ions, communicated our &s;entiments on this head; but as you now in|form us, that it is intended to e&s;tabli&s;h a foundation for future regulations, we willingly enter into the detail; and though this will principally con&s;i&s;t of re|petition, yet it may be u&s;eful to have our ideas pre|&s;ented in one view for your con&s;ideration. And as the&s;e &s;entiments have been more fully confirmed by recent events, we are again induced earne&s;tly to re|commend a &s;trict adoption of the mea&s;ures we advi&s;|ed in our communication of Augu&s;t 18th, 1797, as

being the be&s;t calculated to guard again&s;t the future introduction of contagious di&s;ea&s;es. We now recapi|tulate tho&s;e advices with &s;ome additions.</P>
<P>Let an entire new health-law be made, con&s;titut|ing a Board of Health, to con&s;i&s;t of five per&s;ons, two of whom to be practitioners of phy&s;ic. The &s;mall|ne&s;s of the number will en&s;ure re&s;pon&s;ibility, and a con&s;tant re&s;idence in the city; and the profe&s;&s;ional knowledge of the medical characters will be nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;&s;i&s;t in directing the mea&s;ures of the Board. Let no per&s;on who&s;e private intere&s;t may be affected by quarantine laws, be a member of this Board.</P>
<P>Let a &s;ufficient &s;um of money, per annum, be &s;ub|ject to the draughts of the Board, who &s;hall render to the A&s;&s;embly a yearly account of their expendi|tures. Let this Board &s;it daily during the months of July, Augu&s;t, September, and October; and, during the&s;e months let every ve&s;&s;el from the Medi|terranean, coa&s;t of Africa, We&s;t-Indies, and conti|nent of America, to the &s;outhward of Florida, per|form an effectual quarantine. Let the cargoes of &s;u&s;picious ve&s;&s;els be unloaded, and, with the ve&s;&s;els, be purified at the I&s;land.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="034355_0011_0FFC234447AF02B0">Let a re&s;ident phy&s;ician, or health-officer be ap|pointed, who &s;hall never be ab&s;ent from the I&s;land during the above mentioned months, and a con&s;ult|ing phy&s;ician, who &s;hall re&s;ide at Philadelphia.</P>
<P>Let the puni&s;hment of a ma&s;ter of a ve&s;&s;el, who evades the law, by landing cargo, crew or pa&s;&s;en|gers, contrary to the intent and meaning of it, be the &s;ame as for murder of the &s;econd degree. Let no ve&s;&s;el of war ever be allowed to come above the fort.</P>
<P>Let co-operative laws be procured from the neighbouring legi&s;latures or from congre&s;s.</P>
<P>Let the Board of Health have power, with the concurrence of the Governor, to cut off the inter|cour&s;e with infected per&s;ons and places. Let the long projected Ho&s;pital be erected.</P>
<P>Let the mo&s;t diligent and &s;crupulous attention be given to cleaning and watering the &s;treets, gutters and wharves, throughout the city and liberties.</P>
<P>Such are the precautions which we believe be&s;t calculated to guard again&s;t the future occurrence of calamities &s;imilar to tho&s;e we have experienced. If

further di&s;coveries &s;hall happily add to our know|ledge on this important &s;ubject, we &s;hall not fail to make &s;uch communications to the Governor without delay.</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To his Excellency, THOMAS MIFFLIN, Esq. Governor of the Commonwealth of Penn&s;ylvania.</HEAD>
<P>Although the College had now complied with every requi&s;ition that had been made to them, yet, feelingly impre&s;&s;ed with the magnitude of the &s;ub|ject, they judged it proper to pre&s;ent to the &s;tate legi&s;|lature their rea&s;ons for believing the di&s;ea&s;e to be of foreign origin, hoping that the legi&s;lature would be induced to make &s;uch a change in the health-laws as might &s;ecure us from its future introduction. This Memorial was accompanied with a narrative of facts relative to the probable origin and progre&s;s of the malignant contagious fever, which had late|ly appeared among&s;t us.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="034355_0013_0FFC233CD83649B8">The Memorial contains our mo&s;t &s;triking rea&s;ons for believing in the foreign origin of the di&s;ea&s;e, but for general information, it may be u&s;eful more fully to adduce our arguments in &s;upport of the&s;e opinions, which have been &s;till further confirmed by the circum&s;tances that have occurred during the la&s;t &s;ummer and Autumn; accompanied with &s;uch a &s;tatement of facts as we think cannot fail of pro|ducing conviction in every unprejudiced mind.</P>
<P>Our aim is the inve&s;tigation and &s;preading of truth on this important &s;ubject. We are equally intere&s;ted, with our fellow-citizens in di&s;covering the means of averting &s;o terrible a di&s;ea&s;e. A pro|per health-law for the purpo&s;e has not yet been applied, and unle&s;s &s;omething more efficient be done upon the occa&s;ion, our &s;ea-port towns may &s;oon become uninhabitable.</P>
<P>We &s;hall give our rea&s;ons for believing that the di&s;ea&s;e in que&s;tion is not of dome&s;tic origin, and we tru&s;t they will prove convincing to our legi&s;la|ture, and to our fellow-citizens, generally.</P>
<P>When the de&s;tructive pe&s;tilence raged at Mar|&s;cilles in 1720, there were found phy&s;icians of emi|nence, who &s;trenuou&s;ly maintained, that it was
<PB N="15" REF="034355_0014_0FFC23381ACB15C8">
neither a contagious nor an imported di&s;ea&s;e.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See A Treati&s;e on the Plague, by Patrick Ru&s;&s;ell, M. D. F. R. S. and &s;urgeon to the Briti&s;h factory at Aleppo. Printed, London, 1791.</NOTE> They derived it from the poor diet of the lower cla&s;s of the inhabitants; and although they &s;aw the ve&s;&s;el that brought it, and the mo&s;t unequivocal and dreadful marks of contagion, yet they &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in their fir&s;t opinions. Similar contrarieties of opinion prevailed at Me&s;&s;ina in 1743, but efficient quarantine laws have &s;ince pre&s;erved Mar&s;eilles and Me&s;&s;ina from this de&s;tructive vi&s;itant, although con|tinually expo&s;ed.</P>
<P>In the pre&s;ent year the city of Baltimore has been pre&s;erved in a &s;imilar manner, and we would a&s;k, Is the city of Bo&s;ton more expo&s;ed by its &s;itua|tion to the generation of tropical di&s;ea&s;es than Bal|timore. Where do we &s;ee the fir&s;t appearance of our pe&s;tilential fever? Is it among&s;t the mar&s;hes to the &s;outh we&s;t of our city, or in the neighbour|hood of the wharves? Is it in the confined alleys; or on the &s;alubrious banks of the Delaware at Ken|&s;ington? Is it not always near tho&s;e places where ve&s;&s;els from foreign countries are found?</P>
<P>Look at the di&s;ea&s;e it&s;elf; does any fever of our country ever a&s;&s;ume &s;uch forms, or produce &s;uch
<PB N="16" REF="034355_0015_0FFC233698961140">
effects? Do our &s;evere&s;t bilious fevers generally ter|minate fatally in a few days? Do they &s;teal on in|&s;en&s;ibly, infecting one per&s;on after another in a family and in a neighbourhood? Are they ever equally &s;evere in &s;ea&s;ons &s;o oppo&s;ite as 1797 and 1798? Do not the ri&s;e, the &s;ymptoms, the pro|gre&s;s and the termination of this fatal di&s;ea&s;e, de|mon&s;trate that it is totally different from any thing we have been accu&s;tomed to?</P>
<P>But more particularly to examine the &s;ubject: our principal rea&s;ons for believing that this di&s;ea&s;e does not originate among&s;t us, are the following:</P>
<P>Fir&s;tly. It differs e&s;&s;entially from any other di&s;|ea&s;e which is common to this country, and agrees in its mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential &s;ymptoms, with what is called the Yellow Fever in the We&s;t Indies.</P>
<P>Secondly. It has been regularly traced to the vicinity of &s;ome ve&s;&s;el or ve&s;&s;els, from the We&s;t Indies; or to per&s;ons or cloathing connected with them.</P>
<P>The principal peculiarities of this fever are, its contagious nature, the progre&s;s of the &s;ymptoms and the mortality con&s;equent on it.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="034355_0016_0FFC233515EDFF98">To endeavour to prove the contagious nature of this di&s;ea&s;e would, in our opinion, be equally u&s;ele&s;s as to prove the contagion of the plague. But in all our ob&s;ervation and practice we know of no ca&s;e, where the autumnal bilious remittents of our country have proved contagious. We are aware that the&s;e are &s;ometimes attended with violent and dangerous &s;ymptoms, but this &s;triking characteri&s;tic of contagion being always ab&s;ent, they never be|come an object of public dread or concern.</P>
<P>The characteri&s;tic &s;ymptoms of this di&s;ea&s;e are, generally, a con&s;tant fever for about three days, which, in dangerous ca&s;es, is followed by a ce&s;&s;ation thereof. The concomitant &s;ymptoms of yellowne&s;s of the &s;kin, and vomiting of black matter, which are &s;o common in this fever, do &s;ometimes, though rarely, occur in other di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>The mortality which en&s;ues is &s;uch as is common when pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es prevail. The general confu&s;ion and de&s;ertion of the &s;ick, naturally add to the fatal con&s;equences of the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>As to the &s;econd point, the origin of the fever, we may ob&s;erve, that until the year 1793, no doubts on this &s;ubject, as far as we know, had been pro|mulgated
<PB N="18" REF="034355_0017_0FFC2330A54CEB70">
in America. Doctor Lining of Charle&s;|ton, South Carolina, one of the be&s;t, and the only American author who had then publi&s;hed on this &s;ubject, and who wrote in 1753, expre&s;sly informs us, that the yellow fever had prevailed in that city four times within twenty-five years, and that when|ever it appeared there, it was ea&s;ily traced to &s;ome per&s;on who was lately arrived from &s;ome of the We&s;t India I&s;lands, where it was epidemical.</P>
<P>It may not be improper here to remark, that very erroneous opinions on this &s;ubject have ari&s;en from confounding this pe&s;tilential fever with the malignant remittents of the We&s;t Indies and Ame|rica. The difference &s;till holds good, that the&s;e la&s;t are not contagious, if we may give credit to the writings and ob&s;ervations of Phy&s;icians who have practi&s;ed in the We&s;t Indies, added to our own. But the malignant fever which prevailed in this city in 1793, 1797, and 1798, was always more or le&s;s &s;o, according to circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>A &s;triking peculiarity, which does not occur in any other di&s;ea&s;e, attends the yellow fever in the We&s;t Indies. The natives and per&s;ons who have re&s;ided long in tho&s;e i&s;lands, are very &s;eldom &s;eized with this fever. It was likewi&s;e remarked, and it
<PB N="19" REF="034355_0018_0FFC232F2011DE90">
is a circum&s;tance that de&s;erves particular attention, that very few, if any, of the Creole French in this city, &s;uffered from the contagious malignant fever which prevailed here, in 1793, 1797, and 1798, though the di&s;ea&s;e was introduced into their fami|lies; and children born in this country, of Creole parents, died with it la&s;t autumn, while the parents and the children born in the We&s;t Indies, were en|tirely exempt from it. To European French, Iri&s;h, and other &s;trangers, the di&s;ea&s;e was remarkably fatal. It is an ob&s;ervation, founded in long and exten&s;ive experience, and which admits not of an exception, that &s;trangers are the greate&s;t &s;ufferers from the di&s;ea&s;es of the country into which they migrate: were the yellow fever a di&s;ea&s;e of our country, the Creoles would probably have been among the fir&s;t to experience its fatal effects; but as it is of We&s;t India origin, and their con&s;titutions are a&s;&s;imilated to it, they e&s;caped it here as they do in their na|tive country. The natives of the We&s;t Indies be|ing &s;o &s;eldom affected with the yellow fever, has given ri&s;e and currency to the opinion, that it is not contagious in that country, and with re&s;pect to them the ob&s;ervation is well founded; but then it is as highly contagious to Europeans and Americans in the &s;ea-ports of the We&s;t Indies, as it is in this city, when introduced here. [See Note A. in the Appendix.]</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="034355_0019_0FFC232D9B16C4C8">It is no new opinion that pe&s;tilential fevers are generated in &s;hips or tran&s;ported by them from one place to another; and that when they are brought to a &s;ea-port, where the climate and &s;ea&s;on favor their &s;preading, they always do &s;o in a greater or le&s;s degree.</P>
<P>The plague is checked by great heat and &s;evere cold in the cities of Europe and A&s;ia. We have full proof of the effect of cold upon the malignant contagious fever in North America.</P>
<P>We have equal proof that efficient quarantine laws have latterly pre&s;erved the &s;ea-port towns of Europe from the introduction of the plague; and the example of Baltimore, [Note B.] in the pre&s;ent year, &s;hews us what may be done in America in this re&s;pect. The inefficacy of our own laws and regulations in this important matter is well known, and much regretted by all who have been concerned in their execution.</P>
<P>Perhaps a more particular attention to the circum|&s;tances of the fever of the pre&s;ent year, may place this &s;ubject in a clearer point of light.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="034355_0020_0FFC2327A1526540">In the months of June and July la&s;t, twenty-&s;even ve&s;&s;els arrived in this port from Cape Nichola Mole, Jeremie and Port-au-Prince in the I&s;land of Hi&s;paniola or St. Domingo, places which had long been garri&s;oned by the Briti&s;h forces, and of con|&s;equence more peculiarly adapted to the generation of pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>It is a well known fact, that the&s;e places were evacuated in great ha&s;te, and that a con&s;iderable number of American ve&s;&s;els which lay there, were employed to tran&s;port the Briti&s;h garri&s;on; and if we are to give credit to the facts related by Prin|gle, [Note C.] Lind, [Note D.] Brockle&s;by, Young, Carmichael Smyth and others, contagion is not only generated in &s;uch circum&s;tances, but for a long time retained, by cloathing, bedding, tents, and &s;ails, even walls and timber.</P>
<P>We have further proof that the yellow fever prevailed in tho&s;e ports while the above-mentioned ve&s;&s;els lay there. [Note E.]</P>
<P>On the fifth day of July la&s;t, &s;ix or eight of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els, having a large number of pa&s;&s;engers on board, of cour&s;e a quantity of cloathing, bed|ding, &amp;c. brought off in the greate&s;t ha&s;te, them|&s;elves

expo&s;ed to all tho&s;e circum&s;tances which are generally allowed to produce contagious fevers: in this &s;ituation they arrived at the fort, where they were detained on board for twenty days, [Note F.] an occurrence well adapted to heighten the violence of the contagion. On their arrival at the city, after this detention, they generally lay at the wharves be|tween Walnut and Spruce &s;treets. [Note G.] And it is well known, that at this part of the city the fever fir&s;t appeared, about the latter end of July and beginning of Augu&s;t, and &s;pread from thence to al|mo&s;t every other quarter. The&s;e are facts too re|cent and too generally admitted to require further proof.</P>
<P>On the evening of the eighth of July, the armed &s;hip Deborah, captain Edward Yard, arrived at the fort from Jeremie. She buried <HI>eight</HI> per&s;ons during her &s;tay there and return, [Note H.] and &s;ent <HI>&s;ix</HI> &s;ick to the Marine ho&s;pital. [Note I.] She was one of tho&s;e employed to tran&s;port troops in the We&s;t Indies. [Note K.] After a detention of ten days this ve&s;&s;el came up to the city. We have been a&s;|&s;ured that &s;ome of her crew were brought up be|fore her arrival. [Note L.]</P>
<P>On the twenty-eighth of July, the Deborah was moved to Ken&s;ington, where &s;he was hove down.
<PB N="23" REF="034355_0022_0FFC231ECFA17AE8">
We can clearly trace the ri&s;e and progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e at that place to this ve&s;&s;el; [Note M.] and al|&s;o the fir&s;t appearance of it in &s;ome other parts of the city to per&s;ons who had been on board her. [Note N.]</P>
<P>On the &s;ixth day of Augu&s;t, the College recom|mended to the managers of the Marine and City ho&s;pitals, that all the ve&s;&s;els lying between Walnut and Spruce &s;treets &s;hould be removed to a proper di&s;tance from the city; in&s;tead of which they were di&s;tributed indi&s;criminately to the other wharves, except in one in&s;tance, mo&s;t of them being &s;ent to the upper parts of the city.</P>
<P>From the many &s;ources of contagion above enu|merated, exi&s;ting at the &s;ame time, and being &s;o generally &s;pread, it is not &s;urpri&s;ing that the di&s;ea&s;e had &s;uch an exten&s;ive operation; and it is to this extraordinary circum&s;tance that we al&s;o a&s;cribe the introduction and prevalence of this di&s;ea&s;e at Che&s;|ter, [Note O.] Wilmington and Marcus-hook.</P>
<P>A di&s;ea&s;e &s;o fatal and &s;o de&s;tructive, has natural|ly directed the public attention to di&s;cover the means of preventing its future recurrence. And as men are generally inclined to a&s;cribe effects to &s;ur|rounding circum&s;tances; &s;o in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e a
<PB N="24" REF="034355_0023_0FFC231D4DDD7810">
variety of means have been &s;ugge&s;ted to prevent any future calamity of a &s;imilar nature.</P>
<P>But when we reflect, that Philadelphia is one of the cleane&s;t be&s;t aired cities in the union; that Ken&s;ington, Che&s;ter and Wilmington, enjoy all the advantages of country air; that no po&s;&s;ible im|provement with re&s;pect to water or ventilation, can make our &s;ituation more eligible than that of the&s;e places; and particularly when we con&s;ider, that the &s;ituation of Wilmington precludes all idea of a de|fect of ventilation, and that New-York, being fur|ni&s;hed with water brought from a di&s;tance, the bad quality of our water cannot be the cau&s;e. When we ob&s;erve that our city has become more healthy by the &s;alutary improvements made in it, that the number of our common native di&s;ea&s;es, &s;uch as autumnal remittents and dy&s;enteries, is greatly dimi|ni&s;hed. When we al&s;o ob&s;erve that it is only in &s;ea-ports that this fatal pe&s;tilential fever prevails, why &s;hould we refu&s;e, in this particular in&s;tance, candidly to deduce effects from cau&s;es, and to ad|mit, that although local circum&s;tances may favour the &s;preading of &s;uch di&s;ea&s;es, yet, as they can always be traced to the &s;hipping or its neighbour|hood, or to per&s;ons or materials connected with
<PB N="25" REF="034355_0024_0FFC231AF59C2EA0">
&s;hipping, that there are the &s;tronge&s;t rea&s;ons to conclude that they are introduced from thence?</P>
<P>From the preceding facts and ob&s;ervations we think the following conclu&s;ions may be ju&s;tly drawn.</P>
<P>That the contagious malignant fever which ap|peared in this city in the years 1793, 1797, and 1798, is e&s;&s;entially different from the bilious remit|tent fever of this climate.</P>
<P>That the contagious malignant fever of tho&s;e years is e&s;&s;entially the &s;ame, with the di&s;ea&s;e called the <HI>yellow fever</HI> in the Briti&s;h, and the <HI>maladie de Siam,</HI> in the French We&s;t India i&s;lands.</P>
<P>That the <HI>yellow fever</HI> or <HI>maladie de Siam</HI> pre|vailed in a very great degree in the different ports of Hi&s;paniola, during the la&s;t year, and more parti|cularly in Port-au-Prince, Jeremie and Cape Nicho|la Mole.</P>
<P>That a very great number of ve&s;&s;els arrived at this city from tho&s;e ports, during the months of June and July 1798.</P>
<P>That this di&s;ea&s;e has been &s;everal times introduced into North America by contagion retained in the
<PB N="26" REF="034355_0025_0FFC231852768448">
wearing apparel of per&s;ons who had died in the We&s;t Indies, although no per&s;on was &s;ick on board at the time the ve&s;&s;el arrived in this country; and that we have demon&s;trated, as fully as it is po&s;&s;ible in a matter which is not obvious to our &s;en&s;es, that the contagion of the fever of 1798 was imported from Jeremie, Cape Nichola Mole or Port-au-Prince, in one or more ve&s;&s;els, which arrived here in June and July la&s;t.</P>
<P>That efficient quarantine laws, &s;imilar to tho&s;e exi&s;ting in Italy, France and other countries, to prevent the introduction of the plague into their commercial cities, are the only effectual means to guard again&s;t the future recurrence of a calamity which threatens us with total ruin.</P>
<P>To conclude&mdash;We have, from the fir&s;t appear|ance of this de&s;tructive pe&s;tilence in 1793 to the pre|&s;ent time, endeavoured to di&s;charge our duty, by warning our fellow citizens of its appearance, and by pointing out the means of checking its exten&s;ion when introduced; by informing the legi&s;lature of the proper methods of preventing its return, by &s;trict quarantine laws and internal regulations; and although our re|commendations have been too little attended to, yet
<PB N="27" REF="034355_0026_0FFC231568D458C8">
we conceive it to be a duty again thus to publi&s;h our opinions on the &s;ubject in a more detailed and famili|ar manner, as well for the information of our fellow citizens at large, as of tho&s;e who are called to the very important office of legi&s;lation. In doing this we have no de&s;ign of entering into or exciting contenti|on: our &s;ole aim is truth and the public good.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Extract from Practical Ob&s;ervations on the treatment of acute di&s;ea&s;es; particularly tho&s;e of the West Indies. By <HI>William Wright,</HI> M. D. Fellow of the Royal College of Phy&s;icians of Edinburgh, and of the Royal Societies of London and Edinburgh; and Phy&s;ician to the Forces in the West Indies. From the &s;eventh volume of Medical Facts and Ob|&s;ervations, publi&s;hed in London <HI>1797,</HI> dated Edin|burgh, December, <HI>1794.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SOME late authors, who have written on We&s;t-India di&s;ea&s;es, have roundly a&s;&s;erted, that in tropi|cal countries fevers are not contagious; but whoe|ver has had the care of crowded ho&s;pitals, of jails, of &s;hips of war, or of tran&s;ports full of troops, mu&s;t have &s;een numerous and fatal in&s;tances of con|tagion in the We&s;t Indies; more e&s;pecially where cleanline&s;s and free ventilation have been neglected.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="034355_0028_0FFC230F378AC7D0">From cau&s;es of this &s;ort a mo&s;t fatal and de&s;truc|tive di&s;order broke out in the We&s;t Indies in 1793, and &s;oon after in Philadelphia, viz. the yellow fever. Dr. Ru&s;h has cla&s;&s;ed this di&s;order with remittents; but every one who has practi&s;ed in the We&s;t Indies, knows for certain, that the remitting fevers of warm countries are not contagious. From, Dr. Ru&s;h's book, and from the numerous letters of my corre|&s;pondents, there remains not a doubt, in my mind, of the yellow fever being Typhus, exalted to a great degree of virulence from climate, &s;ituation, and other adventitious circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>The yellow fever has appeared in America at dif|ferent periods, as we learn from Dr. Lining's pa|per in the Edinburgh E&s;&s;ays, Phy&s;ical and Literary, Vol. II.; and it was this &s;ame di&s;order that com|mitted &s;uch havock among&s;t the troops, under Ad|miral Vernon, in 1741.</P>
<P>The commencement of this fever, in Grenada, is dated from May, 1793, &s;oon after the arrival of a Guinea &s;hip from Sierra Leone, the crew of which had been &s;o &s;ickly, that mo&s;t of the &s;ailors died of the yellow fever, either in the voyage, or &s;oon after the arrival of the &s;hip. It &s;uddenly &s;pread over the other Leeward i&s;lands, and from thence was carried to Philadelphia, Hi&s;paniola, and Jamaica.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="034355_0029_0FFC230AC7A7E660">The fir&s;t account I received of this fever, was from Dr. James Clark, a phy&s;ician of eminence in Dominica; his letter to me is dated July 23, 1793, and runs as follows: <Q>I have been hara&s;&s;ed night and day, for a month pa&s;t, by attendance on people ill of the yellow fever. Since its appear|ance in this i&s;land, it has already carried off more than a hundred &s;ailors, new comers, and emi|grants. In its progre&s;s it has been, and &s;till is, as quick and fatal as the plague; it often fini&s;hes its cour&s;e in forty-eight hours; but if the &s;ick get pa&s;t the fifth day, they generally recover.</Q></P>
<P>All the letters I have had from my medical friends agree, that this fever is highly contagious, and that new comers are mo&s;t &s;ubject to receive it, particu|larly &s;uch as are young, or are addicted to drink|ing &s;pirituous liquors. Next to the&s;e are the nur&s;es and attendants on the &s;ick, who breathe the air in their chambers, or handle their bodies or bed|clothes. But &s;uch as avoid infected hou&s;es, or keep at a di&s;tance from people convale&s;cent, are no way &s;ubject to the yellow fever. It appears, al&s;o, that people of colour, and negroes, are in a manner to|tally exempted from this di&s;ea&s;e, except &s;uch as are employed as hou&s;e &s;ervants, and fare the &s;ame as white people.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="034355_0030_0FFC2306CB2A6600">The Creole white inhabitants, and others who have long re&s;ided in the i&s;lands, are, it &s;eems, &s;el|dom attacked with this di&s;order, unle&s;s under the circum&s;tances above-mentioned. But why the yel|low fever &s;hould attack &s;ome, and not others, can only be accounted for in this way: that in order to receive or re&s;i&s;t contagion, men's bodies and minds mu&s;t be in a particular &s;tate; and that field negroes &s;hould not be liable to it is to me inexplica|ble. They, however, have their epidemics, from which white people are exempted.</P>

During this voyage, the fever having acquired new force by the confinement of the air, by the morti|fications and other putrid effluvia, it became &s;o vi|rulent, that above half the number died in the boats; and many of the remainder &s;oon after their arrival. Its re&s;emblance to the plague was further evinced by this memorable incident.

<P>The infected &s;hips were the Prince&s;s Amelia, the Oxford, Shrew&s;bury, Medway, Dublin, and Neptune. The mo&s;t vigorous contagion had invad|ed the two latter.

<P>"The crew of the Cambridge, an healthy &s;hip, enjoyed a good &s;tate of health until &s;ome of them were ordered on board the Neptune, to prepare that &s;hip for the dock, which was then in great di&s;tre&s;s for want of hands, mo&s;t of her people be|ing then at the ho&s;pitals.

<P>"I would have it here ob&s;erved, that this infection did not proceed from any &s;ick per&s;on on board the Neptune; for during this period no &s;ick man was kept for an hour on board any of the &s;hips, if the weather did permit to &s;end him on &s;hore.</P>
<P>"Be&s;ides, in the&s;e &s;hips, it was plain the infection could not proceed from a foul air.

The diet of the people was fre&s;h beef and broth with greens.</P>
<P>"The &s;ick apartment of the Neptune while at &s;ea was on the lower gun-deck, &s;pacious and neat.

<P><HI>This practice of cleanline&s;s and the benefit of the fre&s;he&s;t air, did not however avail to remove this con|tagion; which continued till the &s;hip was taken into dock, and properly purified by fire and smoak.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>During my re&s;idence in Santo Domingo and the Cape, I received frequent information that the yellow fever prevailed in almo&s;t all the &s;ea-port towns in the French part of Hi&s;paniola, particularly at Cape Ni|chola Mole. It raged &s;o violently at this latter place, and the mortality was &s;o great, that it obliged the Briti&s;h to abandon the po&s;t &s;ooner than they intended. About the &s;ame time this di&s;ea&s;e made its appear|ance in the harbour of St. Thomas, and was &s;o de|&s;tructive to foreigners that it obtained the name of
<PB N="37" REF="034355_0035_0FFC22F6EF91C7B8">
<HI>the plague</HI> from all tho&s;e who &s;poke of it. At Santo Domingo I &s;aw &s;everal ca&s;es of it, during the months of Augu&s;t and September. The&s;e were entirely con|fined to American &s;eamen, while the native inhabit|ants of the city were altogether exempt from it. The privateers which frequented this port lo&s;t al&s;o &s;everal of their crew by this fever, while they re|mained at anchor.</P>
<P>I mentioned to you that a &s;imilar di&s;ea&s;e had broke out on board of the &s;chooner Swift at Porto-Rico. The following are the facts re&s;pecting that ve&s;&s;el, viz. On the 11th of la&s;t March &s;he &s;ailed from the Delaware, and, after touching at Tortola and St. Thomas, arrived at the city of Santo Do|mingo on the 13th of April, where &s;he continued un|til the 26th of June, when, &s;he went to the Cape, and returned again on the 1&s;t of Augu&s;t, with|out touching at any other port. She remained at Santo Domingo until the 28th of October, and then &s;ailed for Porto-Rico, where &s;he arrived on the 5th, of November. She anchored at the entrance of the harbour, at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from any other ve&s;&s;el. A &s;hort time before &s;he left the city of San|to Domingo &s;he took on board, from a French pri|vateer that had been di&s;mantled, a quanty of rig|ging, &s;ails, guns and ammunition. From the time

that &s;he left Philadelphia until her arrival at Porto-Rico the crew were healthy, except two of the &s;ail|lors who were affected with venereal complaints. The &s;econd day after &s;he anchored at this latter port the mate and one of the &s;ailors began to complain, and the greate&s;t part of the crew, together with the captain, were &s;ucce&s;&s;ively attacked. The two fir&s;t died after a &s;hort illne&s;s, and one of the others during her pa&s;&s;age to America. The captain e&s;cap|ed in con&s;equence of being brought on &s;hore and carefully attended, at the commencement of the di&s;order. When &s;he arrived at Porto-Rico, and during her &s;tay there, both the harbour and city were remarkably healthy, and her crew had little or no communication with either the &s;hore or the &s;hipping. The&s;e are all the facts which have come to my knowledge re&s;pecting the exi&s;tence of this di&s;ea&s;e in the We&s;t Indies, during the la&s;t &s;ummer and fall. I remain, Sir,</P>

<P>Mr. Purdon &s;ays that on the afternoon of the 1&s;t. or 2d. day of Augu&s;t, being at the hou&s;e of Mr. Alexander Philips in Water &s;treet, he was informed in the cour&s;e of conver&s;ation by Mr. Philips, that he him&s;elf had gone down to a &s;hip at the fort, and brought from thence one of his old lodgers, then &s;ick, to his own hou&s;e in Water &s;treet.

<P>I &s;hall now proceed to mention a few of the early ca&s;es of yellow fever, that occurred in the immediate neighbourhood of the wharf where the &s;hip Debo|rah lay. The &s;hip Deborah arrived at George Eyre's wharf in Ken&s;ington on the 28th day of July, and remained there until the 8th day of Augu&s;t following.</P>
<P>Jo&s;eph Streeton, the fir&s;t victim in Ken&s;ington, was on board the &s;hip Deborah July 21&s;t, 1798, whil&s;t &s;he lay in the city, was taken &s;ick July 29th, and died Augu&s;t 3d.</P>

<P>Samuel Baker, who&s;e dwelling hou&s;e is directly oppo&s;ite the wharf where the Deborah lay, was on the wharf July 31&s;t, when his no&s;trils were a&s;&s;ailed with a very offen&s;ive &s;tench from the &s;hip, out of which, the people who worked on board were heaving &s;ome lumber, and which in&s;tantly induced him to leave the wharf, was taken &s;ick Augu&s;t 3d, and recovered.</P>
<P>Daniel de Benneville, who rode by the wharf in his chai&s;e, daily for a week before his indi&s;po&s;ition, and for three days previous walked twice or thrice a day on the banks, nearly oppo&s;ite the wharf where the &s;hip lay, the wind blowing directly from the &s;hip, wafting a di&s;agreeable &s;tench, which he ob&s;erved to Manuel Eyre, the elder, who was in company; and which produced a violent nau&s;ea, in con&s;equence of which he left the &s;hade on the bank, returned to his hou&s;e, and took &s;ome lavender water and loaf &s;ugar, but without any effectual relief, until he
