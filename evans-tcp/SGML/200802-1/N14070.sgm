<P>THE &s;tory with which the text is connected, is one of the mo&s;t affecting tales to be found on &s;acred record. Taken in all its circum&s;tances, it is beyond a parallel. It contains &s;uch a number of &s;urpri&s;ing incidents, and all, at la&s;t, &s;o overruled by the providence of God, for the good of the ea&s;tern world, that it is not only one of the mo&s;t <HI>entertaining,</HI> but al&s;o the mo&s;t <HI>in&s;tructive</HI> pieces of hi&s;tory. It gives an <HI>illu&s;trious character</HI> to Jehovah, as a being of <HI>&s;uch</HI> &s;ublime perfections, that the mo&s;t unpromi&s;ing events are, by him, made &s;ub|&s;ervient to his own glory, and the good of his people. It teaches the malignancy of the pa&s;&s;ions of envy and
<PB N="6" REF="017807_0004_0FA31A36C58698B8">
hatred on the one hand, and the <HI>&s;trength</HI> of <HI>natural affection</HI> on the other; and when the&s;e are &s;et in <HI>con|tra&s;t,</HI> as in the ca&s;e of Jo&s;eph and his brethren; when the events are <HI>&s;o</HI> unexpected, <HI>&s;o</HI> intere&s;ting, and at la&s;t terminate <HI>&s;o well,</HI> the &s;tory becomes <HI>too</HI> impa&s;&s;ioned to be read with &s;toical <HI>in&s;en&s;ibility.</HI> A man of <HI>&s;enti|ment</HI> and of <HI>piety</HI> can never read it with an <HI>unaffected <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eart,</HI> or with eyes <HI>un&s;uffu&s;ed</HI> with tears.&mdash;<HI>From it</HI> w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> farther learn that guilt is fearful and &s;u&s;picious.&mdash; Thus, the brethren of Jo&s;eph, are under fearful ap|prehen&s;ions (&s;ince their father was dead, who was the centre of union,) left Jo&s;eph, now in power, &s;hould take de&s;erved vengeance upon <HI>them</HI> who had de&s;igned, and <HI>really,</HI> for a time, brought him into mo&s;t unhap|py circum&s;tances. From the&s;e &s;u&s;picions they &s;ent me&s;&s;engers to him, informing that it was the dying injunction of their common parent, that they &s;hould confe&s;s their fault, and a&s;k forgivene&s;s; hoping from the benignity of his di&s;po&s;ition, that he would in con&s;equence thereof, re&s;tore them to his favor.&mdash; They were not mi&s;taken. The injured brother, al|ways generous, humane and god-like, mo&s;t heartily forgave them, a&s;&s;igning this particular rea&s;on for his conduct, "you thought evil again&s;t me, but God meant it for good," &amp;c.</P>
<P>The occurrence to which my text alludes, has a near affinity, in its origin and final i&s;&s;ue, to the tragical event, which eight years ago took place in <HI>this</HI> town, de&s;tined, by divine providence, to be the &s;tage on which a mo&s;t <HI>memorable</HI> &s;cene was acted. The in&s;tances are not, indeed, in all re&s;pects, parallel; and who could expect to find, even in the bible, that copious book, an in&s;tance exactly &s;imilar to <HI>that</HI> which <HI>then</HI> happened in <HI>this place</HI>; which u&s;hered in the <HI>American</HI> war, and gave ri&s;e to this anniver&s;ary, which

The whole has been conducted with great decorum, and to univer&s;al acceptance. The Rev. Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> preached the fir&s;t &s;ermon, in which is contained a par|ticular narrative of the whole tran&s;action; Mr. <HI>Cooke,</HI> of Cambridge, the next; then Mr. <HI>Cu&s;hing,</HI> of Waltham; Mr. <HI>Woodward,</HI> of We&s;ton; Mr. <HI>Morrill,</HI> of Wilmington; Mr. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ummings,</HI> of Billeri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a; and Mr. <HI>Pay&s;on,</HI> of Chel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">a.</NOTE></P>
<P>Were we to trace the &s;imilitude, it would be no difficult matter to point out a &s;triking <HI>one</HI> in <HI>&s;everal</HI> particulars, though not in <HI>all.</HI> It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed there are &s;ome di&s;crepant circum&s;tances. Thus, a &s;in|gle family was concerned in the bani&s;hment of Jo&s;eph; whereas, a whole nation meditated the &s;ubjugation or ruin of the American States.</P>
<P>In the ca&s;e of Jo&s;eph no murder was committed, though originally intended; but murder has been per|petrated <HI>here,</HI> with every circum&s;tance of cruel barba|rity.&mdash;In the&s;e two in&s;tances they differ, but agree in many others.</P>
<P>Jo&s;eph's brethren through fear of his future exalta|tion and aggrandi&s;ement, fir&s;t intended to murder, and afterwards &s;old him into Egypt. Envy was the moving cau&s;e. And what greatly different excited the Briti&s;h king and his parliament to meditate and &s;tir up again&s;t us, a &s;evere civil war of near eight years conti|nuance?
<PB N="8" REF="017807_0006_0FA31A3842FF26A0">
They were jealous we &s;hould one day revolt, become independent &s;tates, and ri&s;e to liberties &s;uperior to their own.</P>
<P>The elder brethren of the family meditated <HI>his</HI> ruin; and who but <HI>our</HI> elder brethren attempted to de&s;poil us of our liberties, and reduce us to a &s;tate of va&s;&s;alage? Again, Jacob's &s;ons advanced Jo&s;eph to <HI>honor</HI> and <HI>di&s;tinction,</HI> by the very means they made u&s;e of, to <HI>humble, depre&s;s</HI> or <HI>de&s;troy</HI> him. So in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, the mea&s;ures made u&s;e of by <HI>Britain</HI> to en&s;lave the in|habitants of this country, have accelerated their <HI>inde|pendency, &s;overeignty</HI> and <HI>honor.</HI> Farther, as the great Jehovah overruled the <HI>malice</HI> and <HI>envy</HI> of <HI>Jo&s;eph's</HI> brethren for the good of the whole family and Jewi&s;h nation; &s;o the <HI>unprecedented ma&s;&s;acre</HI> of <HI>this day,</HI> and the &s;ub&s;equent ravages of the Briti&s;h troops, through the country, though "meant by them for evil, yet the great Jehovah has overruled for good," not only to <HI>this</HI> and the United States of America, but al&s;o to <HI>&s;ome other kingdoms</HI> of the world! And may I not add, that &s;ince the cau&s;es were &s;o &s;imilar, and the ef|fects al&s;o, <HI>we</HI> in this country ought to re&s;olve as Jo|&s;eph did, not <HI>&s;o</HI> to remember the injury done and de|&s;igned, as to ill treat or forbear acts of kindne&s;s to the people of Britain; from whom our ance&s;tors de|&s;cended, to whom we are con&s;equently related, and with whom we &s;ymbolize in <HI>religion, language</HI> and <HI>laws.</HI></P>
<P>Before we proceed to point out the happy effects of the war ju&s;t concluded, to <HI>this</HI> and <HI>other parts</HI> of the world, it may be proper to make &s;ome <HI>&s;trictures</HI> on the d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">trine that is held forth by the text.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="017807_0007_0FA31A3903D98110"><HI>This</HI> and <HI>&s;ome &s;imilar pa&s;&s;ages</HI> of &s;cripture have been much quoted of late by a certain <HI>new</HI> and <HI>up&s;tart</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ct to prove that God is the efficient cau&s;e of &s;in.&mdash; In &s;upport of this novel doctrine, they quote not only my tex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, but &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages as the following&mdash;"<HI>I form the light and create darkne&s;s, I make peace and create evil; I the Lord do all the&s;e things</HI>". And again; "<HI>Is there evil in the city, and the Lord hath not done it?</HI>" The&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, methinks, are greatly wre&s;ted. For they refer not to <HI>moral</HI> but to <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>penal</HI> evil, as has been the confe&s;&s;ion of the <HI>wi&s;e</HI> and <HI>learned</HI> in former ages, a <HI>very few</HI> only excepted. They are now pre&s;&s;ed into the &s;ervice of a particular &s;ect, who would make the wondering world be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eve, that they are the authors of new di&s;coveries, and have unraveled a difficulty which has nonplu&s;ed the brighte&s;t geniu&s;es in former and latter times! But, pri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e apart, who could &s;uppo&s;e that the above-mentioned pa&s;&s;ages coun|tenance any &s;uch &s;entiment? a &s;entiment repugnant to the moral character of the Deity, which &s;ubverts the order of nature, and makes an holy GOD very like to his grand antagoni&s;t, the Devil! To &s;uppo&s;e that GOD cannot effect his de&s;igns without bringing &s;in upon the &s;tage, or influen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing moral agents to the perpetration of it, is to imagine <HI>that all powerful</HI> and <HI>perfect Being</HI> to be weak and impotent, and altoge|ther &s;uch an one as our&s;elves!</P>
<P>It is true, the great <HI>Jehovah</HI> has certain plans of providence which he carries on, and never wants means to effect. But is it not contrary to the true meaning of Scripture, and the <HI>common &s;en&s;e</HI> of man|kind, to a&s;&s;ert that he is the <HI>efficient</HI> cau&s;e of &s;in, and that he influences men to commit it, in order to effect his de&s;igns? There is no need of this; for if good <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be brought about by the wickedne&s;s of men,
<PB N="10" REF="017807_0008_0FA31A39C326F220">
there is forever a &s;ufficient number of moral, free agents, who, prompted by the devil, and their own hearts lu&s;ts, are ready to do that, which under the &s;uperin|tending providence of God, is overruled and finally terminates, either to the <HI>general good</HI> of the &s;y&s;tem, or to a <HI>particular</HI> part of it.</P>
<P>The brethren of Jo&s;eph, filled with envy and ambi|tion, could not brook his dreams, nor bear his party-colour'd coat; and therefore conceived a de&s;ign to murder, or &s;ome way get rid of him: But the great GOD, <HI>known unto whom are all his works, from the beginning of the world; who&s;e coun&s;el &s;hall &s;tand, and who will do all his plea&s;ure,</HI> made the&s;e &s;ame pa&s;&s;ions &s;ub&s;ervient to his particular purpo&s;e. <HI>They</HI> intended to gratify their malice, but <HI>He</HI> to indulge his bound|le&s;s philanthropy and benevolence. Now I would a&s;k. Is there not a mighty difference between GOD's <HI>permitting</HI> the&s;e brethren the gratification of their hearts de&s;ire, and governing it to the public good, and his being the <HI>efficient</HI> cau&s;e of their behavior? The <HI>latter</HI> opinion makes men machines; the <HI>former</HI> is con&s;i&s;tent with that freedom which is <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> to ra|tional beings&mdash;to moral agents.</P>
<P>I have ob&s;erved, that GOD has general plans of providence, which he is ever carrying into execution, and which he &s;ome times accompli&s;hes through the lu&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions of men.&mdash;I will mention a few in|&s;tances out of very many.&mdash;It was the will of heaven that a &s;even years drought &s;hould come upon the <HI>ea&s;tern world,</HI> and that the po&s;terity of <HI>Abraham,</HI> then in <HI>Canaan</HI>&punc; &s;hould be pre&s;erved from the fatal influ|ence of it. This could not be better effected, in the common cour&s;e of things, than by having a prudent man of their own number &s;ent before them into <HI>Egypt,</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="017807_0009_0FA31A3A84BF2620">
that garden of the world, who, having a fore&s;ight of the impending &s;carcity and through a variety of ad|ver&s;e fortune, being rai&s;ed to <HI>di&s;tinction</HI> and <HI>power,</HI> &s;hould cau&s;e the erection of granaries, by &s;tores &s;ea|&s;onably accumulated in which, the <HI>po&s;terity</HI> of <HI>Jacob,</HI> as well as others, &s;hould be pre&s;erved from the &s;ad con&s;equences of a <HI>&s;evere</HI> and <HI>long continued &s;carcity.</HI> This &s;cheme was executed by the malice and envy of Jacob's &s;ons, who &s;old their brother with no other view than to be rid of his pretended, haughty and im|perious temper. Now, through who&s;e efficiency was this barbarous bani&s;hment brought about? God's? or Satan's? Let &s;cripture and common &s;en&s;e decide.</P>
<P>Indeed, &s;ome per&s;ons pretend that God influences to the <HI>opus operatum,</HI> to the outward action, but not to the &s;infulne&s;s of it. This appears to me, a lame ac|count of the matter. It will not quadrate with the ca&s;e referred <HI>to</HI> in the text. How can we, in that in|&s;tance, &s;eparate the action from the obliquity of it? To <HI>kill,</HI> or to <HI>bani&s;h</HI> per&s;ons, under <HI>&s;ome</HI> circum&s;tan|ces, is a virtuous action, a laudable deed, when they have <HI>forfeited</HI> their lives or <HI>merited</HI> exile. But how can the &s;ame be done to innocent per&s;ons without guilt? And if there was guilt, to whom is it to be imputed? To God, or to Jacob's &s;ons? Let God be holy, but every man a &s;inner.</P>
<P>In after ages, the Jews were to be redeemed from <HI>Egypt</HI> by an out &s;tretched arm. The great Jehovah, in that idolatrous country, and <HI>emporium</HI> of the world, cho&s;e to di&s;play his wonderful w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ks, and his evident &s;uperiority to the fal&s;e gods of the Heathen. Nothing gave a greater &s;cope for this, than the ob&s;tinacy of <HI>Pha|raoh,</HI> the reigning prince, who refu&s;ed to let the chil|dren of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> go out of his dominions, till the mo&s;t
<PB N="12" REF="017807_0010_0FA31A3B4570D668">
<HI>a&s;toni&s;hing judgments</HI> were &s;ent, and <HI>miracles</HI> wrought in the land of <HI>Ham!</HI> But we are not from hence to conclude that God by his efficiency produced this pra|vity of di&s;po&s;ition, in the <HI>Egygtian</HI> king. All that was nece&s;&s;ary, was to rai&s;e to the throne, and cau&s;e to &s;tand <HI>there</HI> a certain man, who&s;e avarice, ambition and tyranny prompted him to detain the po&s;terity of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> in his kingdom, till Jehovah demon&s;trated him&s;elf to be the true God of the univer&s;e. There is one ob|jection to this account of the matter: the &s;cripture a&s;|&s;erts, in direct and po&s;itive terms, that <HI>God hardened Pharoah's</HI> heart. It al&s;o &s;ays in other places&punc; that <HI>he hardened his own heart</HI>; nothing more, therefore, can re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;onably be intended thereby, than that God <HI>permitted</HI> him to follow the evil di&s;po&s;itions of his heart, <HI>left</HI> him expo&s;ed to the temptations of the world and the devil, <HI>took</HI> from him his holy &s;pirit, and <HI>brought</HI> him into &s;uch trials, as meeting with a perver&s;e temper, render|ed it more &s;o; not that he u&s;ed any po&s;itive influence in the production of this event.</P>
<P>Farther, it was the will of heaven, a &s;cheme in pro|vidence, that the people of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> &s;hould be planted down in the land of <HI>Canaan.</HI> To this end the antient inhabitants <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be exterminated. <HI>They</HI> were left there|fore, to fill up the mea&s;ure of their iniquity, that &s;o the Jews might be ju&s;tified, in the de&s;truction of them. To &s;uppo&s;e God made them wicked by his own <HI>effi|ciency,</HI> is to imagine that he was reduced to the <HI>hard nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of ju&s;tifying one &s;in by the production of another, than which nothing can be more injurious or ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>Again; The <HI>Jews</HI> after being &s;ometime planted in <HI>Canaan</HI> become extremely vile; &s;o that, agreeable to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> nature of the divine government, it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary

<P>Once more: It was the &s;cheme or plan of provi|dence, to redeem the fallen world by the <HI>advent</HI> and <HI>&s;acrifice</HI> of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> In order to accompli&s;h this benevolent plan, the Saviour of the world mu&s;t be put to a <HI>cruel</HI> and <HI>ignominious</HI> death. <HI>Judas</HI> and the people of the <HI>Jews</HI> &s;tood ready to accompli&s;h the deed, which, though nefarious in it&s;elf, was productive of the happie&s;t con&s;equences to the world. The per|petrators were actuated by the wor&s;t of principles. <HI>Sa|tan</HI>&punc; through the door of avarice, entered into <HI>Judas,</HI> and St. <HI>Peter</HI> declares, that his murderers in general were moved by an evil &s;pirit, and practi&s;ed with wick|ed hands.&mdash;<HI>Him being delivered by the determinate coun&s;el and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken and by wicked hands have crucified and &s;lain.</HI>"&mdash;From the&s;e examples it plainly appears, that though there be <HI>gene|ral &s;chemes of</HI> providence which will be executed; yet we are by no means obliged to recur to the <HI>bla&s;phe|mous a&s;&s;ertions</HI> of &s;ome <HI>late dogmati&s;ts,</HI> who tell us, that as the plan was from heaven, the evil principles by which it was accompli&s;hed were from God.</P>
<P>The&s;e in&s;tances being previou&s;ly mentioned, and commented on, we &s;hall apply the whole to the me|morable

Before the conte&s;t with this we&s;tern world, the &s;pirit and the idea of li|berty, was almo&s;t lo&s;t from Europe, as it had been long before from A&s;ia and Africa. This di&s;pute arou&s;ed it in Ireland, who before were fettered in chains of &s;evere bondage. Poverty and oppre&s;&s;ion reigned in that i&s;land.

But &s;eeing the &s;pirit raging in America, they caught the heavenly fire, and with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in their hands made a bold demand of their

rights, &amp; never de&s;i&s;ted&punc; till England granted their reque&s;t, unfettered their trade, and <HI>now</HI> permit them to live upon terms of reciprocity with them&s;elves! A glorious ef|fect of the American war! Farther, the king of <HI>France</HI> has given free toleration to his Prote&s;tant &s;ubjects, and al|lows them to build their churches, undi&s;turbed in any part of his kingdom! The king of Spain has put an end to the <HI>Inqui&s;ition</HI>; and from the ratified articles of peace between the&s;e two latter kingdoms and <HI>Bri|tain,</HI> it &s;hould &s;eem, that it is made upon more liberal principles than commonly has been between <HI>Prote&s;|tant</HI> and <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> kingdoms.

On <HI>that day,</HI> the <HI>Briti&s;h &s;tandard</HI> erected, pre&s;ented a &s;ickening pro&s;pect to the free born &s;ons of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts: but on <HI>this,</HI> the thirteen &s;tripes of the <HI>Ame|rican flag,</HI> waving and wantoning in the wind, exhilirate the heart, and cau&s;e the pul&s;e of freedom to beat high. On that doleful day, the floor of this &s;acred hou&s;e was crim&s;oned with the blood of our murdered friends, and &s;pread over with their mangled corp&s;es; but on <HI>this,</HI> it is trod by the feet of devout wor&s;hippers, who come hither in crouds to expre&s;s their gratitude to that God who has beheld us with a propitious eye, ap|peared for our help, and turned this anniver&s;ary <HI>from &s;orrow to joy,</HI> and <HI>from mourning into a good day! That day</HI> &s;aw &s;ome of the be&s;t characters of the pro|vince pro&s;cribed, doomed to de&s;truction, and hunted like partridges on the mountains; but <HI>this au&s;picious one</HI> beholds <HI>them</HI> advanced to the <HI>fir&s;t &s;eats</HI> of the go|vernment, and enjoying the <HI>confidence</HI> and <HI>reward</HI> of

an <HI>obliged</HI> people. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When the <HI>Briti&s;h troops</HI> came from Bo&s;ton, it is belie|ved that one part of their bu&s;ine&s;s was to &s;eize, if po&s;&s;ible, his <HI>Excellency John Hancock,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> our pre&s;ent Governor, and the honorable Samuel Adams, who, by their oppo&s;ition to <HI>Briti&s;h tyranny,</HI> had rendered them&s;elves obnoxious; and were known <HI>then</HI> to be in <HI>Lexington.</HI> They happily e&s;ca|ped out of their hands. For having, by private po&s;ts, di&s;|patched from Bo&s;ton, received intelligence of the movement of a detachment of the troops, with the probable object of their view, tho&s;e gentlemen aro&s;e from their beds in the dead of night, decamped, and thus e&s;caped.

There was al&s;o a great propriety in his co|ming up to the hou&s;e of GOD with others, to te&s;tify his thankfulne&s;s to Jehovah, on this occa&s;ion, as <HI>this</HI> was the town where his <HI>pious ance&s;tors</HI> lived; as he was upon the &s;pot when ho&s;tilities were fir&s;t commenced; as he was de|&s;igned to have been one of the fir&s;t victims to their rage; as <HI>they</HI> came <HI>partly</HI> in pur&s;uit of him, and he experienced the divine favor in his &s;ignal pre&s;ervation on that day. The example was &s;uch as ought ever to be &s;et by tho&s;e in power, under &s;imilar circum&s;tances.

<HEAD>APPENDIX. <HI>LEXINGTON,</HI> 22<HI>d April,</HI> 1783.</HEAD>
<P>NEITHER the public nor the world, at this time, need to be informed, that the late great and affecting conte&s;t, between <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> opened in <HI>Lexington,</HI> by the <HI>unprovoked ma&s;&s;acre</HI> of a number of its inhabitants, perpetrated by a body of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> troops, on the <HI>nineteenth</HI> of <HI>April,</HI> 1775.</P>
<P><HI>This</HI> di&s;tre&s;&s;ing <HI>day has been unto us for a memorial.</HI> As &s;uch it hath been &s;tatedly ob&s;erved in this place, as an <HI>important anniver&s;ary,</HI> through the cour&s;e of the late war, by a re&s;pectable appearance of the <HI>militia</HI> in arms, and a &s;olemn a&s;&s;embly of the <HI>whole congregation</HI> in the hou&s;e of GOD, to drop a tear upon the <HI>graves</HI> and mourn over the <HI>a&s;hes</HI> of our <HI>&s;laughtered friends,</HI> religiou&s;ly to notice and acknowledge the hand of GOD, &mdash;humbly to expre&s;s our confidence in him, as the righteous and powerful <HI>avenger</HI> of <HI>injured innocence,</HI> and devoutly to implore his pre&s;ence and aid in the cau&s;e of our country, of po&s;terity, and mankind.</P>
<P>It hath plea&s;ed him, who is <HI>governor among&s;t the nations,</HI> to behold the &s;tate of an oppre&s;&s;ed land, to hear the prayers of an afflicted people, to give them to &s;ee their de&s;ires upon their enemies, and to rejoice in his &s;alvation, by bringing the war to an happy i&s;&s;ue, and granting them the plea&s;ing pro&s;pect of the ble&s;&s;ings of a peace, in which all their rights and claims, as <HI>free, &s;overeign &s;tates,</HI> and an <HI>independent nation,</HI> are e&s;ta|bli&s;hed upon a permanent foundation.</P>

<P>The dawn of the day was u&s;hered in by the ringing of the bell.&mdash;The officers of the <HI>town militia,</HI> with a large number of the inhabitants, being collected toge|ther&mdash;at five o'clock (the time when the <HI>Britons</HI> made their approach, and, without notice or provocation, <HI>inhumanly</HI> fired upon the people of this town) <HI>eight cannon,</HI> from the <HI>artillery,</HI> commanded by Captain <HI>Oliver Brown,</HI> were di&s;charged, in memory of <HI>eight</HI> of our brethren, who fell the <HI>fir&s;t victims</HI> to the op|pre&s;&s;or's cruelty, and <HI>martyrs</HI> in the cau&s;e of liberty, <HI>America,</HI> and mankind.</P>
<P>At the ri&s;ing of the &s;un, a large flag of the <HI>United States</HI> appeared di&s;played over the hou&s;e of Captain <HI>Brown,</HI> near the meeting-hou&s;e and place of parade, where our brethren were <HI>&s;lain,</HI> and <HI>thirteen cannon</HI> were di&s;charged in commemoration of that &s;pirit of liberty, patrioti&s;m and bravery, which, upon that af|fecting event, fired the <HI>American's</HI> brea&s;t, and catching from &s;oul to &s;oul, diffu&s;ed it&s;elf through this wide ex|tended continent, and in&s;pired the inhabitants of thir|teen of the (then) <HI>colonies</HI> of <HI>America,</HI> as <HI>one man,</HI> to ri&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and <HI>revenge</HI> their <HI>brethren's blood</HI>; and, in a &s;o|lemn appeal to heaven, at the point of the &s;word, to a&s;&s;ert, &s;upport and defend their own, and their coun|try's rights.</P>
<P>Between twelve and one, on the arrival of the Go|vernor, (who was pre&s;ent and a witne&s;s of the tragi|cal

&s;cene, which gave ri&s;e to this anniver&s;ary, and who greatly added to the joy of the day by honoring the &s;olemnity with his pre&s;ence) a number of cannon were di&s;charged, as a token of re&s;pect from the inhabitants of the town and a &s;alute to his EXCELLENCY.</P>
<P>At two o'clock, a large number of the inhabitants (&s;everal of whom in years pa&s;t had borne commi&s;&s;ions from this or the United States) turning out as volun|teers, in honor to the day, a&s;&s;embled in arms; and being embodied under the conduct of the pre&s;ent of|ficers of the militia, performed &s;everal <HI>military ma|neuvres</HI> to good acceptance.</P>
<P>Preci&s;ely at three o'clock, the company, command|ed by Capt. <HI>Munroe,</HI> appeared at the hou&s;e of the Rev. Mr. <HI>Clark,</HI> and from thence e&s;corted his Excel|lency the Governor, and a large number of gentlemen in the mini&s;try, and other gentlemen of character, to the meeting hou&s;e, to attend divine &s;ervice.</P>
<P>As the company, with the proce&s;&s;ion, were march|ing to the hou&s;e of GOD, <HI>thirteen cannon</HI> were di&s;char|ged, in memory of the wi&s;dom, firmne&s;s and patri|oti&s;m of the <HI>thirteen colonies,</HI> in declaring them&s;elves <HI>free, &s;overeign and independent &s;tates,</HI> and con&s;olidating their union and &s;trength into one body for glory and de|fence, as a nation, by articles of a confederation, founded in principles of wi&s;dom and equity, virtue and liberty, &s;upported by the experience of ages, and approving it&s;elf to the common &s;en&s;e of mankind.</P>
<P>In the hou&s;e of divine wor&s;hip, prayers and thank&s;|givings were devoutly addre&s;&s;ed to that God who hath been with his people in di&s;tre&s;s, who has carried them thro', and who, alone, is to be exalted in their &s;alvation;

The exerci&s;e was clo&s;ed with a p&s;alm and an anthem, pertinent to the joyful occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>After divine &s;ervice, the proce&s;&s;ion was e&s;corted back to the Rev. Mr. <HI>Clark</HI>'s&punc; by the company in arms, and three vollies fired, as a &s;alute to his <HI>Excellency</HI> and the other gentlemen of the proce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The military company then returned to the place of parade, <HI>when thirteen cannon</HI> were di&s;charged, to celebrate the glory of victory and the joy of peace, to the <HI>Thirteen United States of America,</HI> now delivered from the calamities of war, re&s;tored to the ble&s;&s;ings of peace, and e&s;tabli&s;hed in their freedom, independence and &s;overeignty, as States and a Nation.</P>
<P>The rejoicings of the day were clo&s;ed with a parting &s;alute of three vollies, by the company in arms; and the di&s;charge of a cannon, and the &s;triking of the flag at the &s;etting of the &s;un.</P>
