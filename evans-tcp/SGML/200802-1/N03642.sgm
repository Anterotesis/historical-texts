<P>In the la&s;t Day, that great Day of the Fea&s;t, Je&s;us &s;tood and cried, &s;aying.

<P>NOTHING has render'd the Cro&s;s of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> of le&s;s Effect, nothing has been a greater &s;tumbling Block and Rock of Offence to weak Minds, than a Suppo&s;ition, now currant among us, that mo&s;t of what is contained in the Go&s;pel of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> was de&s;ign'd only for our <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rd</HI>'s fir&s;t and immediate Followers, and con&s;e|quently calculated for one or two hundred Years. &punc;Accordingly many now read the Life, Suf|f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rings, Death, and Re&s;urrection of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> in

the &s;ame Manner as learned Men read <HI>Cae&s;ar's Commentaries,</HI> or <HI>the Conque&s;t of Alexander.</HI> As Things rather intended to afford Matter for Spe|culation, than to be acted over again in and by us.</P>
<P>As this is true of the Doctrines of the Go&s;pel in general, &s;o it is in particular of the Operations of <HI>God</HI>'s Spirit upon the Hearts of Believers, for we no &s;ooner mention the Nece&s;&s;ity of our receiv|ing the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> in the&s;e la&s;t Days, as well as formerly; but we are look'd upon by &s;ome, as Euthu&s;ia&s;ts and Madmen; and, by others, repre|&s;ented as wilfully deceiving the People, and un|dermining the e&s;tabli&s;hed Con&s;titution of the Church.</P>
<P>JUDGE ye then, <HI>my Brethren,</HI> whether it is not high Time for the true Mini&s;ters of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> who have been them&s;elves made Partakers of this heavenly Gift, to lift up their Voices like a Trumpet; and if they would not have tho&s;e Souls peri&s;h for which the <HI>Lord Je&s;us</HI> has &s;hed his precious Blood, to declare with all Boldne&s;s, that the holy Spirit is the common Privilege &amp; Portion of all Believers in all Ages; and that we al&s;o, as well as the fir&s;t Chri&s;tians, mu&s;t receive the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> e'er we can be truly called the Chil|dren of <HI>God.</HI></P>
<P>For this Rea&s;on, (and al&s;o that I might An&s;|wer the De&s;ign of our Church in appointing the pre&s;ent Fe&s;tival) I have cho&s;en the Words of the Text.</P>
<P>THEY were &s;poken by <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> when as the Evangeli&s;t tells us, he was at the Fea&s;t of Tabernacles. Our Lord (herein leading all an
<PB REF="004451_0004_100D9E2E4947D2F0">
Example) attended on the Temple-Service in general, and the Fe&s;tivals of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Church in particular. The Fe&s;tival at which he was now pre&s;ent, was that of the Fea&s;t of Tabernacles, which the <HI>Jewes</HI> ob&s;erved according to <HI>God</HI>'s Ap|pointment in Commemoration of their living in Tents. At the la&s;t Day of this Fea&s;t, it was cu&s;to|mary for many pious People to fetch Water from a certain Place, and bring it on their Heads, &s;inging this Anthem out of <HI>I&s;aiah,</HI> <Q>And with Joy &s;hall they draw Water out of the Wells of Salvation.</Q> &mdash; Our dear Lord <HI>Je&s;us</HI> ob&s;erving this, and it being his con&s;tant Practice to &s;piritua|lize every Thing that he met with, cries out, <HI>If any Man thir&s;teth, let him come unto me, rather than unto that Well and drink. &mdash; He that believeth on me, as the Scripture hath &s;poken,</HI> (where it is &s;aid, God will make Water &s;pring of a dry Rock, and &s;uch like) <HI>out of his Belly &s;hall flow Rivers of living Water.</HI>&mdash; And that we might know what our Saviour meant by this living Water, the E|vangeli&s;t immediately adds, <HI>But this &s;pake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him &s;hould receive.</HI></P>
<P>THESE la&s;t Words I &s;hall chiefly in&s;i&s;t on in the en&s;uing Di&s;cour&s;e, and &s;hall treat on them in the following Manner,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I &s;hall briefly &s;hew what is meant by the Word <HI>Spirit.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> I &s;hall &s;hew that this <HI>Spirit</HI> is the common Privilege of all Believers.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> I &s;hall &s;hew the Rea&s;on on which this Doctrine is founded.</P>
<P><PB REF="004451_0005_100D9E2FE0112310"><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> I &s;hall conclude with a general Ex|hortation, to believe on <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> wherby alone we can be qualified to receive this Spirit.</P>
<P>AND, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I am briefly to &s;hew what is meant by the Spirit.</P>
<P>By the <HI>Spirit,</HI> or the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> is to be un|der&s;tood the third Per&s;on in the ever ble&s;&s;ed Trinity, con&s;ub&s;tantial and co eternal with the Father and the Son, proceeding from, yet equal to them both. For to u&s;e the Words of our Church in this Day's Office, that which we be|lieve of the Glory of the <HI>Father,</HI> the &s;ame we believe of the <HI>Son,</HI> and of the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> without any Difference or Inequality.</P>
<P>THUS &s;ays St <HI>John,</HI> in his fir&s;t Epi&s;tle, Chap. v. Ver. 7. <HI>There are Three that bear Record in Hea|ven, the</HI> Father, <HI>the</HI> Word, <HI>and the</HI> Holy Gho&s;t, <HI>and the&s;e Three are one.</HI> And our Lord when he gave his Apo&s;tles Commi&s;&s;ion to go and teach all Nations, commands them to Baptize in the Name of the <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly Gho&s;t,</HI> as well as of the <HI>Fa|ther</HI> and the <HI>Son.</HI> &mdash; And St <HI>Peter, Acts</HI> v. Ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. &s;aid to <HI>Ananias, Why hath Satan filled thine Heart to lie to the Holy Gho&s;t</HI>? And Ver. 4 he &s;ays, <HI>Thou ha&s;t not lied unto Men, but unto God.</HI> From all which Pa&s;&s;ages, it is plain, that the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> is truly and properly <HI>God,</HI> as well as the <HI>Father</HI> and the <HI>Son.</HI> This is an un&s;peakble My&s;tery, but a My&s;tery of <HI>God's</HI> revealing, and therefore to be a&s;&s;ented to with our whole Hearts. Seeing <HI>God</HI> is not a Man that he &s;hould lie, nor the Son of Man that he &s;hould deceive.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="004451_0006_100D9E3314CD87F0">I proceed <HI>Secondly,</HI> to prove, that the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> is the common Privilege of all Believers.</P>

<P>BESIDES, it is po&s;&s;ible for thee, O Man, to have Faith, &s;o as to be able to remove Moun|tains, or ca&s;t out Devils ; nay, thou mighte&s;t &s;peak with the Tongue of Men and Angels, yea, and hid the Sun &s;tand &s;till in mid&s;t of Heaven; yet, what would all the&s;e Gifts of the Spirit a|vail thee, without being made Partakes of his &s;anctifying Graces? <HI>Saul</HI> had the Spirit of Go|vernment for a while, &s;o as to become another Man, and yet was a Ca&s;taway And many, who ca&s;t out Devils in <HI>Chri&s;t's</HI> Name, at the la&s;t will be di&s;owned by him.

But unle&s;s Men have Eyes which &s;ee not, and Ears which hear not, how can they read the latter Part of the Text, and not con|fe&s;s that the Holy Spirit, in another Sen&s;e, is the common Privilege of all Believers, even to the End of the World? <HI>This &s;pake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him &s;hould re|ceive.</HI> &mdash; Ob&s;erve, he does not &s;ay, they that be|lieve on him for one or two Ages, but they that believe on him in general, <HI>i e.</HI> at all Times, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> all Places.&mdash; So that unle&s;s we can prove that St. <GAP DESC="foreign"> was under a Delu&s;ion who he wrote the&s;e Words, we mu&s;t believe tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> we, even we al&s;o, &s;hall receive the <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly Gho&s;t,</HI> if we believe on the Lord <HI>Je&s;us</HI> with our whole Hearts.</P>
<P>AGAIN, our Lord, ju&s;t before his bitter Pa&s;&s;ion, when he was about to offer up his Soul an Offering for the Sins of the World; when his Heart was mo&s;t enlarged, and he would undoubtedly demand the mo&s;t excellent Gift for his Di&s;ciples, prays, <HI>that they all may be one, as thou, Father are in me, and I in thee, that they al&s;o may be one in us &mdash; I in them, and thou in me, that they be made perfect in one</HI>; that is, that all his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ue Followers might be united to him by his Holy Spirit, by as real, vital, and my&s;tical an Union, as there is between <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> and the Father.

For it is evident from our Lord's own Words, that he had us and all Beli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vers in View, when he put of this Prayer, <HI>Neither pray I for the&s;e alone, but for them al&s;o which &s;hall believe on me through their Word</HI>; &s;o that, unle&s;s we treat our Lord as the

<P>THERE'S a great Noi&s;e m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">de of late, about the Word Enthu&s;ia&s;t, and it has been ca&s;t upon the Preachers of the Go&s;pel, as a Term of Re|proach &mdash; But every Chri&s;tian, in the proper Sen&s;e of the Word, mu&s;t be an Enthu&s;ia&s;t.&mdash; That is, mu&s;t be in&s;pired of God, or have God in him. For who dare &s;ay, he is a Chri&s;tian, till he can &s;ay, <HI>God is in me</HI>? St. <HI>Peter</HI> tells us, we have many great and precious Promi&s;es, that we may be made Partakers of the Divine Nature. &mdash; Our Lord prays, that we may be One, as the Father and He are One; and our own Church, in Conformity to the&s;e Texts of Scripture, in her excellent Communion Office, tells us, that tho&s;e who receive the Sac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ament worthily, <Q>dwell in Chri&s;t, and Chri&s;t in them; that they are One with Chri&s;t, and Chri&s;t with them.</Q> &mdash; And yet, Chri&s;tians in general, mu&s;t have their Names ca&s;t out as Evil, and Mini&s;ters in par|ticular mu&s;t be looked upon as Deceivers of the People, for affirming, that we mu&s;t be realy united to God, by receiving the Holy Gho&s;t. Be a&s;to|ni&s;hed, O Heavens as this!</P>
<P>INDEED, I will not &s;ay, our&punc; Letter-learned Preachers deny this Doctrine in expre&s;s Words &mdash; But however, they do it in Effect. &mdash; For they talk profe&s;&s;edly again&s;t inward Feel|i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gs, and &s;ay, we may have <HI>God</HI>'s Spirit without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eeling it, which is in Reality to deny the Thing it&s;elf.

of the Go&s;pel, and to e&s;tabli&s;h the Kingdom of Darkne&s;s, I would go about, telling People, they might have the Spirit of <HI>God,</HI> and yet not feel it.</P>
<P>BUT to return,&mdash; When our Lord was about to a&s;cend to his Father, and our Father; to his <HI>God,</HI> and our <HI>God</HI>; He gave his Apo&s;tles this Commi&s;&s;ion, <Q>Go and teach all Nations, baptiz|ing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t.</Q> &mdash;By the Term, <HI>All N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tions,</HI> 'tis allowed, are meant all that &s;hould profe&s;s to beli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ve on <HI>Je&s;us</HI> always, even to the End of the World. And accordingly, by Authority of this Comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ion, we do baptize them in this and every Age of the Church.
