<Q>For Rulers are not a terror to Good Works, but to the Evil.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THAT this Epi&s;tle was writ|ten to a Number of Chri&s;ti|ans in <HI>Rome</HI> is unque&s;tiona|ble. Whither it was writ|ten to a Church there &s;eems not evident.</P>
<P>THE former part of the Epi&s;tle is Doctrinal; and it treats of the mo&s;t important Doctrines of the Go&s;pel; as GOD'S eternal Purpo&s;e, Fore-knowledge, Prede&s;tina|tion, Vocation of Sinners into a State of Grace, their Ju&s;tification there-upon, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Doctrine of Ju&s;tification is here very particu|larly and clearly handled, by the Apo&s;tle.</P>
<P>THE latter part of the Epi&s;tle is Practi|cal, In&s;tructive of us as to variety of Duties to be done by us. Within this part falls this Chapter, and particularly this Text; <HI>For
<PB N="2" REF="002180_0005_10030BB48F5B6968">
Rulers are not a terror to good works; but to the Evil.</HI></P>
<P>IN v. 1. We have a Divine Command gi|ven by the Mouth of an Apo&s;tle, <HI>viz. Let every Soul be &s;ubject unto the higher Powers. The Soul</HI> is here put for the Per&s;on, as frequently other-where in Scripture. <HI>Every Soul,</HI> in|cludes Per&s;ons of all Ranks and Di&s;tinctions. <HI>Powers,</HI> are here intended of Civil Rulers; for the Apo&s;tle is not here treating of Church|government.</P>
<P>OBEDIENCE to this Precept is here urged by weighty Rea&s;ons. GOD made Man a Rational Being; and as &s;uch He deals with him. He expects he &s;hould be &s;wayed by Rea&s;on; and accordingly he is hereby pre&s;&s;ed to his Duty.</P>
<P>AND He tells us,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THAT the Powers are of GOD.</HI> They are Ordained by Him, are Con&s;tituted by His Authority. And this &s;hould certainly be of weight with Rational Beings, with every Man that owns a GOD, and him&s;elf to be His Creature, &s;u&s;tained by Him every Moment, and deriving from Him every thing, every good thing that is injoyed by him.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>THAT who&s;oever re&s;i&s;ts the Power, re&s;i&s;ts the Ordinance of GOD.</HI> He does not ultimately
<PB N="3" REF="002180_0006_1003015DE7428598">
re&s;i&s;t a Creature, but GOD Him&s;elf, while he re&s;i&s;ts, or oppo&s;es him&s;elf again&s;t His Ordi|nance. He wages War with GOD Him&s;elf. And what daring Madne&s;s is this in the Crea|ture! Who is, as we read, in Jer. 18.6. <HI>In GOD'S Hand as the clay is in the Potters hand.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>THAT they that re&s;i&s;t, &s;hall receive to them&s;elves Damnation.</HI> A dreadful doom in|deed! A &s;trong Motive it is to be &s;ubject to Government. Its the &s;ame word both in the Tran&s;lation and Original, which we read, in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11. 29. re&s;pecting Per&s;ons Unworthi|ly receiving the Lords Supper. And tho' it be true that the word might be tran&s;lated, <HI>Judgment</HI>; its al&s;o true, That either of the&s;e Sins, with all others that Men are guilty of, or any particular Sin what&s;oever; without Repentance, will i&s;&s;ue in Damnation.</P>
<P N="4">4.(WHICH brings me to my Text) he tells us, <HI>That Rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. q. d.</HI> Obey them, Chear|fully &s;ubmit to their Authority and Rule; for tho' they be Men armed with the Sword of Civil Ju&s;tice; they are only evil workers, vicious Per&s;ons, to whom they are a terror. They will not hurt the good: No, their Power is, as is the Law, in 1 Tim. 1.9. <HI>Not again&s;t a Righteous Man, but again&s;t the Lawle&s;s, Di&s;obedient, Ungodly, Unholy, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="002180_0007_10030BB72EC9EBA8">IN the Words of the Text we have,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THE &s;ubject &s;poken of,</HI> viz. Rulers; Such to whom the Civil Government is by GOD committed; they are Rulers, Ruling in the Fear of GOD; Rulers in Scripture deno|minated gods. P&s;al. 82.1. <HI>GOD judgeth among the gods</HI>: they are gods, as being cloa|thed with His Authority; gods, as bearing the lively Image of His own Impartiality, E|quity, Ju&s;tice, &amp;c. mixed with Lenity and Mercy.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>WHAT is Predicated or Affirmed of them.</HI> They are a <HI>Terror.</HI> Their Countenances, De|portments, and Admini&s;trations carry a terror in them.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>TO whom they are thus, or the objects of this Terror of theirs.</HI> And they are thus, (1) Negatively, Not to good works. Here works are put for Per&s;ons working. Rulers are no terror to them that be hone&s;t and good; that do good &amp; work righteou&s;ne&s;s. (2) Po&s;itive|ly, They are a terror to evil works. <HI>i. e.</HI> To evil workers. Evil workers, Vicious Per|&s;ons, are they to whom they are a terror. Again&s;t the&s;e it is that the Point, of their Sword of Civil Ju&s;tice is &s;et. Immoral Men, Men of evil Practices, of wicked Lives, are the objects of their terror. Thus are <HI>Rulers a terror not to good works, but to the evil,</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="002180_0008_100301608C2A5D58">
<LABEL>DOCTRINE.</LABEL>
THEY are Evil Workers, Vicious Per&s;ons, to whom Rulers are a Terror.</P>
<P>TO the&s;e and only the&s;e, according to their Character in my Text, they are &s;o. They are Evil Workers again&s;t whom their faces are &s;et, and the edge of their Authority turned. They will not hurt the good: No, Rom. 13.3. <HI>Do good, and thou &s;halt have prai&s;e of them.</HI> They will not di&s;coutenance, but incourage the doing of Good. This you may expect; for we read in Rom. 13.4. <HI>The Civil Ruler is the Mini&s;ter of GOD unto thee for good.</HI></P>
<P>FOR further Illu&s;tration of this Truth, I &s;hall fir&s;t lay down the following Po&s;itions; then An&s;wer the Inquiry, <HI>viz.</HI> How, or in what way are Rulers a terror to Evil Workers, to Vicious Livers?</P>
<P>POSITIONS.</P>
<P>Po&s;ition, 1. <HI>That RULE Originally belongs to GOD Only.</HI> The right of Rule is Primari|ly alone in the Hand of the High and Lofty ONE, who inhabiteth Eternity. Even a proud and lofty &s;pirited Heathen &s;eems to
<PB N="6" REF="002180_0009_10030BB8DF76D710">
have been convinced of this, in Dan. 4.34&mdash;<HI>I prai&s;ed and honoured Him that liveth for ever, who&s;e Dominion is an everla&s;ting Do|minion, and his Kingdom from Generation to Generation.</HI> And it will come to that again, that all Rule &s;hall be intirely in the Hand of the Great JEHOVAH. We read, in 1 Cor. 15.24. That the Great Mediator <HI>&s;hall put down all Rule, Authority, and Power</HI>; and then <HI>&s;hall deliver up the Kingdom to GOD.</HI> And v. 28. <HI>When all things &s;hall be &s;ubdued unto the Son; the Son Him&s;elf &s;hall be &s;ubject to Him that put all things under Him; that GOD may be all in all.</HI></P>
<P>Po&s;ition, 2. <HI>RULE being a Communicable Property of GOD, it may be derived unto His Creatures.</HI> Creatures may by participa|tion be inve&s;ted with Rule and Government, which be Originally in GOD alone. As Ho|line&s;s, Ju&s;tice, Goodne&s;s, &amp;c. are commu|nicable Properties of GOD: &s;o is Dominion al&s;o.</P>
<P>Po&s;ition, 3. <HI>IT was accordingly communica|ted to</HI> Adam <HI>in Innocency.</HI> To him was gi|ven Dominion over every Sublunary Being. GOD cloathed him in a degree with His own Authority. Gen. 1.28. &mdash; <HI>Have Dominion over the Fi&s;h of the Sea, the Fowl of the Air, and over every living thing that moveth on the
<PB N="7" REF="002180_0010_10030163D6732970">
Earth.</HI> And in this Dominion &s;eems the Image of GOD on <HI>Adam,</HI> in part to have con|&s;i&s;ted. It was indeed Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Ho|line&s;s in which it principally did con&s;i&s;t; but not exclu&s;ive of Rule and Government, with which he was betru&s;ted.</P>
<P>Po&s;ition, 4. <HI>A forfeiture was made by the fall of this as well as of all other good.</HI> Man by this Apo&s;tacy forfeited all his favours. He retained no title to any good at all; no right to any thing either profitable, plea&s;u|rable, or honourable. To that deadly com|plicated death only, now he had a title: Gen. 2.17. &mdash;<HI>Thou &s;halt &s;urely die.</HI> He was now not only &s;tript of his right to Rule, as well as other benefits: but his condition was much wor&s;e than that of cur&s;ed <HI>Canaan,</HI> Gen. 9.25. <HI>A Servant of Servants &s;hall he be unto his Brethren.</HI></P>
<P>Po&s;ition, 5. <HI>GOD by common favour, on the Revelation of the Go&s;pel, re&s;tored Rule in &s;ome degree to fallen Man.</HI> This is undeni|ably evident from Scripture. Not only Rule, but Rule by Divine appointment, now belongs to fallen Man; to &s;ome in one kind, to others in another; to &s;ome in one degree, to others in another. And this is among GODS com|mon favours: it belongs to bad as well as good Men. Its no di&s;tingui&s;hing Character
<PB N="8" REF="002180_0011_10030BBF29032928">
of gracious Per&s;ons from others of Mankind. No, Dominion is not founded in Grace. Even wicked <HI>Saul</HI> was the LORD'S Anointed: He had right to Rule in I&s;rael, tho' he was totally, devoid of any &s;aving good.</P>
<P>Po&s;ition, 6. <HI>RULE is either common to Mankind in general; or appropriated more par|ticularly unto Some of them.</HI> Common Rule belongs to Men as Men re&s;pited from pre&s;ent Ruine, and allowed to continue for a time in the World; to an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">r the Ends that Infinite Wi&s;dom has de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d, with re&s;pect to them. This every Man is in &s;ome degree a &s;harer in. The re&s;toration of this to Apo&s;tate Man, we have the account of, in Gen, 9.2. <HI>And the fear of you, and the dread of you, &s;hall be upon every bea&s;t of the earth, &amp;c. Into your hand are they delivered.</HI> That Rule which is more Special, is either, (1) <HI>Natural,</HI> as that of Pa|rents re&s;pecting Children. They have a Na|tural, tho' a limitted right of dominion over them; and Children are accordingly under a Natural tie to yield Obedience. (2) <HI>Civil Rule,</HI> including in it that which is Military al&s;o. (3) <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical,</HI> which is &s;etled in and over the vi&s;ible Church by CHRIST, as the King and Head of it. Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Rulers before the Mo&s;aick Law, were the Fir&s;t-born of the Families. Under the Law the Stated Rulers of the Church were the Prie&s;ts and
<PB N="9" REF="002180_0012_1003016C60474288">
Levites Since the Law, they are Apo&s;tles, Evangeli&s;ts, Pa&s;tors and Teachers.</P>
<P>BUT the Civil Rulers are they of whom my Text &s;peaks, and concerning whom it is affirmed; <HI>They are a Terror, not to good works,</HI> &amp;c. They are evil workers, vicious per&s;ons, to be a terror unto whom the&s;e are con&s;titu|ted by GOD. This by Divine appointment is their Office: And on this very thing they are to attend, <HI>Rom.</HI> 13.6.</P>
<P><LABEL>QUESTION.</LABEL>
BUT how, or whereby do Rulers become a Terror to Evil Workers, to Per&s;ons of Vicious Lives, and Practices?</P>
<P><LABEL>ANSWER.</LABEL>
THEY are and appear to be a Terror to evil workers.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>BY their very Countenances and Grave deportments.</HI> Per&s;ons of ill Manners and ba&s;e Practices may read in the very Countenances of Rulers, their ill-re&s;entment of them. Even therein may be read their hatred of them that work iniquity. We read, in Prov. 25.23. <HI>The North wind driveth away rain, &s;o does an angry countenance, a backbiting Tongue.</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="002180_0013_10030BC601CE76A0">
Backbiting Tongues, and other ba&s;e Practices, have the countenances of Rulers &s;et again&s;t them. Nor are their Grave deportments, in their daily Conver&s;ation, without u&s;e and &s;ervice this way.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>BY their manife&s;t Aver&s;ion from Per&s;ons of ill fame, and di&s;&s;olute Lives.</HI> They loath the practices of Vicious Per&s;ons. As the Ru|ler in I&s;rael: P&s;al. 26.5. <HI>They hate the Con|gregation of evil-doers, and will not &s;it with the wicked.</HI> They loath the works of them that turn a&s;ide to Vicious Cour&s;es. <HI>They are the faithful of the Land on whom they &s;et their eyes</HI>; towards whom they manife&s;t their counte|nances favourable. P&s;al. 101.3, 6. <HI>Nor will they know,</HI> with approbation, <HI>any wicked Per&s;on.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>BY Enacting Laws &s;uited to the Suppre&s;&s;ion of Immorality and Vice, and the incouragement of Equity and Virtue.</HI> The Laws of the Land &s;hall be adapted by them to the great ends of incouraging them that do well, and the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of evil Men, and evil Manners.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>BY looking diligently to the Execution of them.</HI> Rulers will carefully &s;ee to it that the Laws an&s;wer their proper end; that they be not wre&s;ted by evil men, to &s;erve ba&s;e de&s;igns, nor the u&s;e of them fru&s;trated by &s;uch as Study how to evade their force.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="11" REF="002180_0014_10030BC78DFAACA0">5. <HI>BY Rejecting with abhorrence, tho&s;e Men that would obtain, with Money, Places of Honour and Tru&s;t.</HI> They will without any further inquiry determine &s;uch Men unfit for any Publick Place or Station. Rulers know that its not <HI>Bribery</HI> but <HI>Virtue</HI> that makes Men &s;it to repre&s;ent, as Rulers do, the Per&s;on of the Son of GOD. Accordingly they will carefully avoid preferring Men to Publick Places, of ba&s;e, fordid, &s;elfi&s;h Spirits.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>BY throwing out of Place Officers that be evidently Unfaithful to their Tru&s;t.</HI> They will hear their te&s;timony again&s;t Immorality, by di&s;placing Unfaithful Officers. The Publick &s;hall know that they are not Abetters of any &s;uch Men. In this way they will make it known that their Practice is agreeable to their Character in my Text. Immoral Per|&s;ons &s;hall be dive&s;ted of their Offices, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from their Places of Publick Tru&s;t.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>BY appointing Per&s;ons to keep Publick Hou&s;es, who are them&s;elves a terror to &s;ensu|al, &s;loathful, vile and ba&s;e Men.</HI> They will pick our Men in Towns for that Place, that be Men of Hone&s;ty and Courage; Men that hate gain by the Sins of other Men; Men that will carefully ob&s;erve the Laws re&s;pect|ing Taverns; that will di&s;countenance Town|dwellers,
<PB N="12" REF="002180_0015_10030BCAEF7788F8">
and re&s;erve their Publick Hou&s;es for &s;uch for whom they are by Law de&s;igned, Men that regard the Intere&s;t of Religion, and prefer the Publick Weal above their Private Intere&s;t, &s;hall be the Men for the&s;e betru&s;t|ments. Indeed there are few Men in the Pro|vince, that have greater advantages, either to prevent, or promote the Ruine of this People, than Tavern-keepers have.</P>
<P N="8">8. La&s;tly, <HI>BY giving proper Incouragement, and &s;uitable Support to the Go&s;pel-Mini&s;try.</HI> The direct end of that is not only to terrifie Evil-workers; but to eradicate Original Sin it &s;elf, from whence all evil works proceed. Its direct tendency is to beat down the Devils Kingdom, and ra&s;e the very root of Actual Sin. Accordingly we read, as in Act. 26.18.&mdash;<HI>I &s;end thee to open mens eyes, to turn them from darkne&s;s to light, and from the power of Satan to GOD.</HI> Thus runs the Commi&s;&s;ion given to the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try. So in 2 Cor. 10.4. <HI>The weapons of our Warfare are not carnal, but mighty thro' GOD, for the pulling down of &s;trong holds.</HI> The&s;e &s;trong holds are the ob&s;tinate Wills of deeply depraved Men: and for the breaking down of the&s;e, to a &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to GOD's righteou&s;ne&s;s, is the Go&s;|pel Mini&s;try appointed.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="002180_0016_10030BD26A0B7938">THE great end of Civil Government is, to re&s;train Mens Corruptions, to prevent Sin from breaking out to that degree to deluge the World; to damm up its Streams, that they may not as a mighty Torrent, carry all before them. This is the great end of Civil Laws, Penalties annexed to them, Puni&s;h|ments inflicted on Malefactors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The&s;e things are appointed of GOD as means to re&s;train Mens exorbitant Lu&s;ts.</P>
<P>BUT the tendency of the Go&s;pel-Mini&s;try is, to kill the very root of Sin; to heal the depraved Natures of Men that be tainted and poi&s;oned with it. It tends indeed to curb their Lu&s;ts, and keep them from being &s;o Vicious and Prophane, as otherwise they would; but its al&s;o appointed as a Means to heal their wretched Natures, and cure them of their Heart-plagues.</P>
<P>RULERS will accordingly &s;ee to the In|couragement and Support of the Go&s;pel-Mi|ni&s;try. This &s;urely they will do, as knowing that in this way they are a Terror to evil workers.</P>
<P>AND they will do it,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>BY promoting Learning in the Tongues and Arts.</HI> They know that &s;uch Learning is
<PB N="14" REF="002180_0017_10030BD440DC5E10">
highly needful to qualifie Per&s;ons for the Mini&s;try; and that our Fathers that &s;etled this Country, even in the Infancy and Poverty of it, were accordingly at charge to erect a College for Education, beyond what was to be had in Grammar Schools.</P>
<P N="2">2. BY di&s;countenancing the folly of People in Choo&s;ing Mini&s;ters according to their vain Fancies, without regard either to the Civil Law, or Scripture-qualifications.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>BY taking care that Mini&s;ters be not Nece&s;&s;itated to leave their Studies, to prevent the Starving of their Families.</HI> And on this I may pre&s;ume, as concluding it well known to our Rulers. (1) <HI>That the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try ought to be Maintained, and that honourably by the People. The Lord has ordained that they that Preach the Go&s;pel, &s;hould live of the Go&s;pel,</HI> 1 Cor. 9.14. He wills, that while People par|take of their Spiritual Things, they &s;hould partake of their Carnal things, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 9.11. And declares it rea&s;onable from the very light of Nature, and u&s;age of Nations, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 9.7. (2) <HI>Con&s;equently, that People ordinarily, are able to Maintain the Mini&s;try among them.</HI> Being commanded &s;o to do, they have ability there-unto. Were it not thus, certainly &s;uch a Precept had never been given them of GOD. It is true, that re&s;pecting &s;ome Spiritual
<PB N="15" REF="002180_0018_10030174CA91BBF8">
duties required of Men, we can't argue from the Command, an ability to obey: but re&s;pecting any external acts of Obedience, the argument &s;eems to be &s;trong, from GOD's Precept, to argue ability in People to yield Obedience. Accordingly, People ordinarily are able to Maintain and that decently and honourably, the Go&s;pel-Mini&s;try among them. (3) <HI>That People do not ordinarily thus Main|tain it.</HI> I &s;peak not this to reflect on any Place or People: but I take it to be evident to Judicious Rulers, that thus it is. (4) <HI>That GOD has authorized them to &s;ee that Ju&s;tice be herein done to the Mini&s;try.</HI> And, (5) <HI>That it will be for the Intere&s;t of People them&s;elves, that their Mini&s;ters have ju&s;t dealing in this regard from them.</HI> Rulers know that this will tend not to their Poverty, but their Pro&s;perity. Sure I am that the Scripture thus affirms. Prov. 3.9, 10. <HI>Honour the Lord with thy &s;ub&s;tance, and with the fir&s;t fruits of all thy increa&s;e. So &s;hall thy barns be filled with plenty,</HI> &amp;c. Mal. 3.10. <HI>Bring ye all the tithes in to the Store-hou&s;e, that there may be Meat in mine hou&s;e; and prove me now here|with, &s;aith the Lord of Ho&s;ts, if I will not open you the windows of Heaven, and pour you out a ble&s;&s;ing,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>I pa&s;s now to the Improvement of the Doctrine.</P>

<P><HI>THAT ab&s;olute perfection be not expected from any Order of Men what&s;oever.</HI> We are not in the State of Innocency, with <HI>Adam</HI> be|fore the fall. Nor do we live among the Stars, where the proper Orbs are kept, and all the Motions regular. We live in a Cur&s;ed, and a Wicked World. Sin and Cor|ruption, darkne&s;s and error have infe&s;ted every Society of Men. Rulers, whither Civil or Eccle&s;ia&s;tical; People, whither in the State or Church, labour under the deadly fruits of the fir&s;t Apo&s;tacy. There is not a Per&s;on among us, but often wanders out of his way. Jam. 3.2. <HI>In many things we all offend.</HI> Ab|solute Perfection then, is not to be expected among us. Nor ought it to be a &s;tumbling-block to any, that it is not found.</P>
<P>THERE was not unmixed Equity in the Civil State, no, not in <HI>Solomons</HI> time. Eccl. 3.16. <HI>I &s;aw under the Sun the place of Judg|ment, that wickedne&s;s was there, and the place of righteou&s;ne&s;s, that iniquity was there.</HI> Nor are all things right in the Eccle&s;ia&s;tick Polity in any Age; whither among Pa&s;tors, or Peo|ple; Rulers, or Ruled. Nor may it be ex|pected while the word holds good, in Jer. 17.9. <HI>The heart of man is deceitful above all
<PB N="17" REF="002180_0020_10030BE288F25FF0">
things, and de&s;perately wicked.</HI> Indeed that word, if duely thought of, will &s;tain the Pride of all humane glory; and lay every Man, from the King on the Throne, to the Beggar in the Street, in the du&s;t, before GOD.</P>
<P>AGAIN, People, through Ignorance and want of Judgment, may think that ami&s;s in Rulers, which indeed is not &s;o. Acts of Rulers may be &s;ometimes ill re&s;ented, for want of knowing the true ground and rea&s;on of them.</P>
<P>AND again, Errors in Government may oft proceed from the Iniquities of People, as the moral cau&s;e thereof. If that be some|times true, <HI>Delirant Reges, plectuntur Ach<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">i</HI>; that is infallibly true, in Prov. 28.2. <HI>For the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of a Land, many are the Princes thereof.</HI> And &s;o as to other afflictive evils relating to Government.</P>
<P>USE, II. Is of In&s;truction &amp; Exhortation.</P>
<P>ARE Rulers a Terror to evil Workers: Then,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>WHAT will GOD Him&s;elf, the Gover|nour of the World be? He is the Judge of all the Earth,</HI> Gen. 18.25. <HI>Ju&s;tice and Judgment are the habitation of his Throne.</HI> And what will
<PB N="18" REF="002180_0021_10030BE44C17B018">
become of wicked-workers then, when they fall into His Hand? That will be found a &s;olemn Truth, in Heb. 10.31. <HI>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living GOD.</HI> It were much better for wicked men never to have been born, than thus to fall into the Hands of this GOD.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>RULERS then are a great ble&s;&s;ing to a wretched World.</HI> Were not evil-workers terrified by Rulers, the World would &s;oon be Uninhabitable. Men would not be able to live one among another. They would be in an higher degree than now they are, as de&s;cribed in Hab. 1.14. <HI>As the Fi&s;hes of the Sea, devouring one another.</HI> Tyranny its &s;elf is le&s;s bad than Anarchy. But Rulers ruling in the fear of GOD, are indeed great ble&s;|&s;ings. Unto their Rule, under GOD, is the Peace and Tranquillity of a People very much owing.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>OUR Rulers then, will mind their Cha|racter, given in my Text.</HI> Its the in&s;pired Apo&s;tle that &s;aith, <HI>Rulers are a Terror to evil works.</HI> A great part of this A&s;&s;embly are Rulers. Will each One ever bear in Mind, ever make proper and beneficial re|flections on this their Character; <HI>Rulers are a Terror, not to good, but to evil works.</HI></P>
<P N="4"><PB N="19" REF="002180_0022_10030BE940D057F0">4. <HI>THANK we GOD for Rulers.</HI> Let them be accounted among the rich, tho' but common ble&s;&s;ings of a Land. Rulers ruling in the fear of G0D; doing Ju&s;tice &amp; Judg|ment; &s;eeking the wealth of their People, are a great and a rich ble&s;&s;ing. <HI>The&s;e are the Shields of the Earth,</HI> P&s;al. 47.9. <HI>They bear up the Pillars of a Land,</HI> as in P&s;al. 75.3. What a Chaos of confu&s;ion, and field of blood would the World pre&s;ently be, were it not for Go|vernment. Let Rulers then be acknowledged as great ble&s;&s;ings to our Land.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>LET all Pray for them, that they may ever be a Terror to evil-workers.</HI> This is the Preceptive Will of GOD, in 1 Tim. 2.2. <HI>Let Prayer be made for Kings, and for all that be in Authority.</HI> Hitherto few if any People in the World have been favoured by GOD, in re&s;pect of Government, as <HI>New-England</HI> has been. Let GOD be &s;ought, for the continu|ance of this Favour. And let none contri|bute by their ingratitude, to the forfeiture of it.</P>
<P>I conclude only with two words, which have evidently much of awe and &s;olemnity in them. And they are directed to the two con&s;tituent parts of this great A&s;&s;embly, <HI>viz.</HI> Rulers, and Ruled, And,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="20" REF="002180_0023_1003017ADA804188">1. WILL <HI>our Rulers think how they repre|&s;ent the very Per&s;on of the Incarnate SON of GOD.</HI> That Sacred Per&s;on is verily repre|&s;ented by You. Its His Authority you are inve&s;ted with; for He is not only the Head of the Church, <HI>but the head over all things to the Church,</HI> Eph. 1.22. All Power is given to Him as Mediator. And with His Kingly Power, by Participation, Civil Rulers are in|ve&s;ted. On this account they are called <HI>gods,</HI> in <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 82.6.</P>
<P>ITS true, it is &s;o, and more than barely &s;o, re&s;pecting Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Rulers: They al&s;o repre&s;ent His very Per&s;on, and that not in one only, but in all His Offices, Propheti|cal, Prie&s;tly, and Kingly. I do not &s;ay, That they repre&s;ent His per&s;on in all Parts of all His Offices, but in all His Offices. His Pro|phetical Office, they repre&s;ent, in Speaking from GOD unto the People; His Prie&s;tly Office, in Praying for them; and His Kingly, in Ruling of them. Accordingly we read, as in Joh.20. 21. &mdash;<HI>As my Father hath &s;ent me, &s;o &s;end I you.</HI> Heb. 13.17. <HI>Obey them that have the rule ever you.</HI> Mat. 28.19. <HI>Go and teach all Nations.</HI> James 5. 14. <HI>Let the Elders of the Church Pray for him.</HI> Thus do they repre&s;ent the Per&s;on of CHRIST. Nor are their Commi&s;&s;ions le&s;s Authentick, but le&s;s
<PB N="21" REF="002180_0024_10030BEEB6E567E0">
Mediate from Soveraign Power, than tho&s;e of Them in Civil Government. And it may accordingly &s;eem &s;trange, that any that be acquainted with the Bible, &s;hould either in their Prints, or Practice, a&s;&s;ign them their Place at the Peoples feet.</P>
<P>But when Rulers, whither Civil or Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tick, think, who&s;e glorious Per&s;on is repre&s;ented by them, How &s;olemn will be the thought! What awful impre&s;&s;ions will it make on their Spirits! What manner of Per&s;ons will they think them&s;elves obliged to be in an holy unblamable Conversation! None in the World are under &s;uch &s;olemn and &s;trong ties, as the&s;e, to regard &amp; obey that Precept, in Eph. 5.15. <HI>See then that ye walk circum&s;pectly.</HI> Beware of &s;o much as a wry Step, left the infinite Per&s;on repre&s;ented by you, be thereby reflected on, and di&s;ho|noured; lea&s;t His Great Name be blasphe|med by your means.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>LET People, who make the other con&s;ti|tuent Part of this A&s;&s;embly, regard you, Civil Rulers, as being of this Character.</HI> Know, that they repre&s;ent the Per&s;on, and are cloathed with the Authority of GOD the SON. They are on this account termed, as in Psai. 82.6. <HI>The Children of the Mo&s;t High.</HI> Thus then regard them, and deport your &s;elves accordingly toward them. And,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="22" REF="002180_0025_1003017F98F30A08">1. <HI>DO not conclude their acts in Govern|ment to be nece&s;&s;arily ami&s;s, becau&s;e you can't pre&s;ently &s;ee the ground and rea&s;on of them.</HI> Things done may be rea&s;onable, ju&s;t and e|qual, tho' every eye can't pre&s;ently di&s;cern the rea&s;onablene&s;s, equality, and ju&s;tice of them.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>WITH-hold not the re&s;pect and honour from them, which is their due, in regard of their Character.</HI> Honour them, as repre&s;enting the Per&s;on, and cloathed with the Authority a|bove mentioned. Honour is their due, and accordingly they &s;hould have it, <HI>Deut.</HI> 5.16.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>CHEARFULLY Pay them their Tri|bute what is owing to them, on the account of the continual Service they do for you.</HI> Unto this Justice it &s;elf obliges you: and the ground to enforce to the doing Ju&s;tly in this regard the Apo&s;tle has given us, in <HI>Rom.</HI> 13.6. having &s;aid that Tribute was paid to Civil Rulers, he gives the ground of it, <HI>viz. For they are God's Mini&s;ters, attending continually on this very thing.</HI></P>
