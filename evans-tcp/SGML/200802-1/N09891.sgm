<P><HI>"PRAY what does the author mean?" is the first question most readers will ask, and the last they are able to answer. Therefore in a word I will explain the subject and design of the following poem.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The subject is the state of the times in regard to literature and religion. The author was prompt|ed to write by a hope that it might be of use to point out, in a clear, concise, and striking manner, those general errors, that hinder the advantages of education, and the growth of piety. The subject is inexhaustible; nor is my design yet completed. This first part describes the principal mistakes in one course of life, and exemplifies the following well-known truth, That to the frequent scandal, as well of religion, as learning, a fellow, without any share of genius, or application to study, may pass with credit through life, receive the honors of a liberal education, and be admitted to the right hand of fel|lowship among ministers of the gospel. That, except in one neighbouring province, nonsense and ignorance wander unmolested at our colleges, examinations are dwindled to meer form and ceremony, and after

four years dozing there, no one is ever refused the honors of a degree, on account of dulness and in|sufficiency. That the</HI> meer <HI>knowledge of antient languages, of the abstruser parts of mathematics; and the dark reserches of metaphysics, is of little advantage in any business or profession in life. That it would be more beneficial, in every place of pub|lic education, to take pains in teaching the elements of oratory, the grammar of the English tongue, and the elegancies of style, and composition. That in numberless instances throughout these colonies, sufficient care hath not been taken to exclude the ignorant and irreligious, from the sacred desk. That this tenderness to the undeserving, tends to debase the dignity of the clergy, and to hinder many wor|thy men from undertaking the office of the ministry. And that the virulent controversies of the present day, concerning religious, or in many cases, meerly speculative opinions, savouring so highly of vanity and ostentation, and breathing a spirit so opposite to christian benevolence, hath done more hurt to the cause of religion, than all the malice, the ridicule, and the folly of its enemies.</HI></P>

<L>Your sacred dignity to raise.</L>
<L>Though blunt the style, the truths set down</L>
<L>Ye can't deny&mdash;though some may frown.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yes, there are men, nor those a few,</L>
<L>The foes of virtue, and of you;</L>
<L>Who, nurtur'd long in dulness' school,</L>
<L>Make vice their trade, and sin by rule,</L>
<L>Who deem it courage, heav'n to brave,</L>
<L>And wit, to scoff at all that's grave;</L>
<L>Vent stolen jests, with strange grimaces,</L>
<L>From folly's book of common places:</L>
<L>While mid the simple throng around</L>
<L>Each kindred blockhead greets the sound,</L>
<L>And, like electric fire, at once,</L>
<L>The laugh is caught from dunce to dunce.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The deists scoffs ye may despise;</L>
<L>Within yourselves your danger lies;</L>
<L>For who would wish neglecting rule,</L>
<L>To aid the triumphs of a fool?</L>
<L>From heav'n at first your order came,</L>
<L>From heav'n receiv'd it's sacred name,</L>
<L><PB N="24" REF="012585_0022_0F8B18BF25077E00">
Indulg'd to man, to point the way,</L>
<L>That leads from darkness up to day,</L>
<L>Your highborn dignity attend,</L>
<L>And view your origin and end.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While human souls are all your care,</L>
<L>By warnings, counsels, preaching, prayer,</L>
<L>In bands of christian friendship join'd,</L>
<L>Where pure affection warms the mind,</L>
<L>While each performs the pious race,</L>
<L>Nor dulness e'er usurps a place;</L>
<L>No vice shall brave your awful test,</L>
<L>Nor folly dare to broach the jest,</L>
<L>Each waiting eye shall humbly bend,</L>
<L>And rev'rence on your steps attend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But when each point of serious weight,</L>
<L>Is torn with wrangling and debate,</L>
<L>When truth, mid rage of dire divisions,</L>
<L>Is left, to fight for definitions,</L>
<L>And fools assume your sacred place,</L>
<L>It threats your order with disgrace;</L>
<L>Bids genius from your seats withdraw,</L>
<L>And seek the pert, loquacious law;</L>
<L><PB N="25" REF="012585_0023_0F8B18C01115BFB0">
Or deign in physic's paths to rank,</L>
<L>With ev'ry quack and mountebank;</L>
<L>Or in the ways of trade content,</L>
<L>Plod ledgers o'er of cent. per cent.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While in your seats so sacred, whence</L>
<L>We look for piety and sense,</L>
<L>Port dulness raves in schoolboy style;</L>
<L>Your friends must blush, your foes will smile,</L>
<L>While men, who teach the glorious way,</L>
<L>Where heav'n unfolds celestial day,</L>
<L>Assume the task sublime, to bring</L>
<L>The message of th' eternal king,</L>
<L>Disgrace those honors they receive,</L>
<L>And want that sense, they aim to give.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now in the desk with solemn air,</L>
<L>Our hero makes his audience stare;</L>
<L>Asserts with all dogmatic boldness,</L>
<L>Where impudence is yok'd to dulness;</L>
<L>Reads o'er his notes with halting pace,</L>
<L>Mask'd in the stiffness of his face;</L>
<L>With gestures such as might become</L>
<L>Those statues once that spoke at <HI>Rome,</HI></L>
<L><PB N="26" REF="012585_0024_0F8B18C0A67569C8">
In awkward tones, nor said, nor sung,</L>
<L>Slow-rumbling o'er the faltring tongue,</L>
<L>Two hours his drawling speech holds on,</L>
<L>And names it preaching when he's done.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With roving tir'd, he fixes down</L>
<L>For life, in some unsettled town,</L>
<L>People and priest full well agree;</L>
<L>For why&mdash;they know no more than he.</L>
<L>Vast tracts of unknown lands he gains,</L>
<L>Better than those the moon contains:</L>
<L>There deals in preaching and in prayer,</L>
<L>And starves on sixty pounds a year,</L>
<L>And culls his texts, and tills his farm,</L>
<L>And does no good, and little harm;</L>
<L>On sunday in his best array,</L>
<L>Deals forth the dulness of the day;</L>
<L>And while above he spends his breath,</L>
<L>The yawning audience nod beneath.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus glib-tongu'd <HI>Merc'ry</HI> in his hand</L>
<L>Stretch'd forth the sleep-compelling wand.</L>
<L>Each eye in endless doze to keep&mdash;</L>
<L>The God of speaking, and of sleep.</L>
