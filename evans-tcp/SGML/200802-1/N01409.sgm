<HEAD>A LETTER, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I Believe it can't be unknown to you, That &s;ome time the la&s;t Summer, I pre&s;ented a <HI>Memorial</HI> to His Excellency the <HI>Governour</HI> and <HI>Council,</HI> referring to the <HI>Bank of Credit,</HI> Projected by a Number of Gentlemen, Merchants, and others among us; and you mu&s;t needs have &s;een in the Publick <HI>News-Paper,</HI> an Order of <HI>Council</HI> that was pa&s;&s;ed upon that Occa&s;ion; whereby the Projectors were directed to <HI>Proceed no further in that Affair, until the next Se&s;&s;ion of the General A&s;&s;embly,</HI> That &s;o the whole Government might be of Advice in a Matter of that Weight and Con&s;equence. Notwith&s;tanding all which, (I am loth to &s;ay in Contempt of it) the Per&s;ons Concerned, are openly carrying on their <HI>Bank</HI> with utmo&s;t Vigour and Expedi|tion; as Suppo&s;ing, and indeed Affirming, That the Government have nothing to do with them in that Affair: So that 'tis very much to be que&s;tioned, whether the Projectors
<PB N="4" REF="001675_0003_0fb4e0f61a27f410">
will make any Application to the <HI>General A&s;&s;embly</HI> or not; looking upon them&s;elves very Well and Sufficient without it. But does it follow, <HI>SIR,</HI> That the Government mu&s;t &s;it &s;till, and neither <HI>Say</HI> nor <HI>Do</HI> any thing, when they &s;ee and hear of a Projection that is ju&s;t ripe for Execution, which &s;o very much Imports the Prerogative of the <HI>Crown,</HI> the Con&s;titution and Laws of this Province, the E&s;tates and Liberties of the People, and that not only for the pre&s;ent, but &s;ucceeding Ge|nerations? No, it can't be!</P>
<P>I doubt not, but that before I have fini&s;hed this Letter, to prove beyond all Que&s;tion, and that by very good Rea&s;on, That as it Principally, and in the fir&s;t Place behoves the <HI>Government,</HI> and <HI>General A&s;&s;embly</HI> of the Pro|vince, &s;o it really Concerns every Man that has any Intere&s;t in this Country, with great Application to Enquire into, and &s;eriou&s;ly Con&s;ider the Nature and Con&s;equences of this <HI>Bank</HI> of <HI>Partner&s;hip,</HI> and that before it take Effect, and there be no Remedy: For do but &s;uppo&s;e, <HI>SIR,</HI> This <HI>Pandora's Box</HI> once opened, and Two Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds of the&s;e <HI>Bank-Bills</HI> I&s;&s;ued and Circulating upon <HI>Loan,</HI> or otherwi&s;e, and the Govern|ment at home &s;hould afterwards, in their Great Wi&s;dom Di&s;approve and Suppre&s;s 'em, or it &s;hould otherwi&s;e Mi&s;carry and come to
<PB N="5" REF="001675_0004_0fb4e0f8a9403228">
nothing, by any unfore&s;een Accident; into what irreparable Mi&s;chiefs, Confu&s;ion and Mi&s;ery would every body be Involved, that had to do with 'em? and the Blame and Reproach of it finally (with too much Rea|&s;on) be thrown and Center on the <HI>General A&s;&s;embly</HI>: For it will be Natural for every one then to &s;ay, <HI>Ay' Why did not the Government Interpo&s;e and Prevent this?</HI> And it was this very Con&s;ideration that principally Determined me at this time, freely to Communicate my Thoughts upon this Matter: And I could not, I am &s;ure, think of a more &s;uitable Per|&s;on to Offer 'em to, than One, who has de&s;ervedly &s;o good a Character and great an Influence in his Country.</P>
<P>But before I proceed any further, I mu&s;t pray you not to mi&s;take my De&s;ign; for my Intention is not &s;o much to &s;it in Judgment upon this <HI>Bank Projection,</HI> as to Awaken the Government, (Pardon the Expre&s;&s;ion) and to Convince the Projectors, that not one Step in an Affair of this Con&s;equence, ought to be taken without the Knowledge and Leave of His Maje&s;ty's Government of this Province, and that for the&s;e two Rea&s;ons: Principally,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> Becau&s;e we are a Dependent Go|vernment, and mu&s;t in all things Conform our &s;elves to the Laws of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and the In&s;tructions of the <HI>Crown</HI>; and therefore
<PB N="6" REF="001675_0005_0fb4e0fce29f1538">
mu&s;t expect to give an Account of all our Matters. And then,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> Becau&s;e the People of this Coun|try have their next and immediate Depen|dance on the <HI>General A&s;&s;embly,</HI> who are there|fore to &s;ee to it, (as they will an&s;wer the Tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them) that the <HI>Common-Wealth</HI> re|ceive no Damage by their Means. But to proceed in what I have further to &s;ay, I &s;hall take this Method. Fir&s;t I &s;hall give you a &s;hort Ab&s;tract of the Projection it &s;elf, and then &s;ome of my Sentiments or Reflections upon it.</P>
<P>The Projection in &s;hort, as I under&s;tand it is thus: <HI>A, B, C, D, &amp;c,</HI> to the Number we'll &s;ay of one Hundred, by a certain Policy of their own Framing, Aggregate or Join them&s;elves together into a <HI>Company</HI> or <HI>Partner|&s;hip,</HI> in Order to make a <HI>Bank of Credit,</HI> as they call it, by Sub&s;criptions, amounting to Two Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds; which Sum they propo&s;e to make into <HI>Bills,</HI> of <HI>Pounds,</HI> and <HI>Shillings,</HI> and to let 'em out at Four Pounds <HI>per Cent.</HI> Intere&s;t; the Sub&s;cribers them&s;elves being obliged to take out one quarter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of their re&s;pective Sub&s;criptions, and give good Security accordingly; the other three Quarters to be let out upon good Land Secu|rity, to &s;uch as will borrow 'em; the Profits ari&s;ing from time to time, upon the Loan of
<PB N="7" REF="001675_0006_0fb4e100230408f8">
the <HI>Bills,</HI> to be to the Community or <HI>Partner|&s;hip,</HI> excepting &s;ome Proportions thereof, which they propo&s;e for the U&s;e of the Go|vernment, the Town of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and &s;ome other Publick U&s;es, after the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">piration of &s;uch a Time, and on certain Conditions therein Ex|pre&s;&s;ed.

<P>Now in the fir&s;t Place, <HI>SIR,</HI> How Plainly and Greatly mu&s;t the Prerogative of the <HI>Crown,</HI> and the Honour of Government, be
<PB N="8" REF="001675_0007_0fb4e10266f06628">
affected by, and concerned in this Projection? Dare any Man of Law, or will any Man that loves or under&s;tands any thing of Go|vernment, Say, or Imagine, That &s;uch a <HI>Bank</HI> as this, may Safely, or can indeed Po&s;&s;ibly be &s;et up, and carried on without a <HI>Charter</HI> from the <HI>Crown</HI>? Shall a Number of Per&s;ons, of their own Head, Form them&s;elves into a Compa|ny, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n&s;titution of their own making, and Erect them&s;elves into a <HI>Body Politick,</HI> and Corporate to all Intents and Purpo&s;es in the Law, &s;o as to Sue and be Sued, to Purcha&s;e and Grant Lands to take in Succe&s;&s;ion, with the Power of Making and Lending at one Stroke, the Mode&s;t Sum of <HI>Two Hundred Thou|&s;and Pounds,</HI> and afterwards as much more as they &s;hall &s;ee meet? Certainly, Men that Talk at this Rate, mu&s;t be ab&s;olute Strangers to the Con&s;titution and Laws of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> the Honour of Government, the very Notion and Nature of Corporations: For any one that has but lookt into the Hi&s;tory of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>London,</HI> will find that the &s;everal Com|panies, Fraternities, and Corporations there, have been all of them Created, either by <HI>Charter</HI> from the <HI>Crown,</HI> or by Act of <HI>Parlia|ment,</HI> and &s;ome of 'em by both; and neither have, nor pretend to any other Powers, Fran|chi&s;es or Liberties, than &s;uch as are Given and Limited to 'em in and by their &s;everal
<PB N="9" REF="001675_0008_0fb4e1039822d928">
<HI>Charters.</HI> And indeed it is altogether as Ab&s;urd in the Law, for a <HI>Body Politick</HI> to Create it &s;elf, as in Philo&s;ophy for the <HI>Body Natural.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Law-Books</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> do all <HI>Una Voce</HI> Proclaim it as an undoubted Truth, That all <HI>Powers Politick,</HI> all <HI>Franchi&s;es, Liberties, Charters Corporations,</HI> and the like, are Derived from the King, as their Original Fountain. And I believe this is the fir&s;t time that ever any thing to the Contrary entred into the Rea&s;on of any Man out of <HI>Eutopia.</HI> I am &s;ure the Great and Famous <HI>Bank of England</HI> was fir&s;t Found|ed, and is &s;till Supported on the &s;trength of an Act of <HI>Parliament,</HI> and a <HI>Charter</HI> of the late King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary</HI> of Glorious Memory; as may be &s;een at Large by the &s;aid Act of <HI>Parliament</HI> made in the Fifth and Sixth Years of that Reign: Whereby Their Maje&s;ties were Impower'd to Incorporate a Number of Gentlemen, Merchants, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by the Name of the <HI>Governour and Company of the Bank of England</HI>; who were to Govern them|&s;elves by certain Rules and Limitations, made partly by the &s;aid Act of <HI>Parliament,</HI> and to be made by Their Maje&s;ties in the <HI>Charter,</HI> and which was finally Subject to the Condition of a Redemption by <HI>Parliament.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="001675_0009_0fb4e10684087880">But our Gentlemen, it &s;eems, have found out a nearer way to a <HI>Bank</HI> and <HI>Corporation,</HI> than the Tedious and Trouble&s;ome one of a <HI>Charter</HI> from Home, or Acts of <HI>A&s;&s;embly</HI> here; and not only pre&s;ume to Incorporate them|&s;elves, and make their own Rules and Orders, but al&s;o very Dutifully foreclo&s;e and &s;hut out the Government from any Power of Redemp|tion, or indeed any other Concern with 'em.</P>
<P>Po&s;&s;ibly the&s;e Gentlemen may &s;ay, They don't pretend to Incorporate or make them|&s;elves a <HI>Body Politick, &amp;c.</HI> but to Obviate that Objection, I &s;hall give you the Notion, and Nature of a Corporation, as I find it in my Lord <HI>Cook's</HI> In&s;titutes, and then leave you to Judge how Incon&s;i&s;tent this Objection is with their Policy or Projection.</P>
<P>My Lord <HI>Cook</HI> &s;ays, <Q>A Corporation is a Body to take in Succe&s;&s;ion, Framed as to that Capacity by the Policy of Man, and called a Corporation, becau&s;e the Per&s;ons are made into a Body, and &s;o are of Capa|city to Take or Grant, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with Powers to Sue or be Sued, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> Now 'tis ea&s;y to ob|&s;erve, how fully the Projectors, in their Scheme, have come up to this De&s;cription of a Corporation.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="001675_0010_0fb4e1089b1d4ca8">As to their <HI>Bank-Bills,</HI> I readily grant they are not Money; for indeed nothing can be Money properly, and in the Law of <HI>England,</HI> but <HI>Silver</HI> or <HI>Gold</HI> (both which are of an In|trin&s;ick and Univer&s;al Value) that has the Impre&s;s of the Prince, and made Current at a Rate, or Value &s;et by Act of <HI>Parliament,</HI> or Proclamation of the <HI>Crown.</HI> However, the&s;e <HI>Bills</HI> will have as much the Face and Signa|tures of Money, as even the <HI>Bills</HI> of the <HI>Bank of England,</HI> or the <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> of this Pro|vince. For they are to be <HI>Printed,</HI> to be <HI>Stamped</HI> with an <HI>E&s;cutcheon,</HI> to be <HI>Mark'd</HI> with <HI>Pounds</HI> and <HI>Shillings</HI>: They are to be Let out at Intere&s;t, and finally, the Projectors them|&s;elves tell us, They are to &s;erve as a <HI>Medium</HI> of Exchange, which was the Fir&s;t Ri&s;e, and &s;till continues the End and U&s;e of Money. But that which I In&s;i&s;t on under this Head as before, is, That no Per&s;on, or Number of Per&s;ons what&s;oever,, can A&s;&s;ume, or may Dare to take this Power to them&s;elves, but mu&s;t Derive it from the <HI>Crown.</HI></P>
<P>But be&s;ides what I have &s;aid of the Pre|rogative, the Nature of <HI>Corporations</HI> in Gene|ral, with <HI>Political Powers, Liberties, &amp;c.</HI> and in Particular of the <HI>Bank of England,</HI> I mu&s;t needs ob&s;erve to you, an Act of <HI>Parliament</HI> made in the Sixth Year of the Reign of our
<PB N="12" REF="001675_0011_0fb4e109858a1358">
late Sovereign Lady Queen <HI>Anne</HI> of Ble&s;&s;ed Memory, wherein it is Enacted, <HI>That during the Continuance of the</HI> Bank of England, <HI>it &s;hall not be Lawful for any Body Politick or Corporate, other than the &s;aid Company of the</HI> Bank, <HI>or for other Partners exceeding Six in</HI> England, <HI>to Bor|row, or Owe any Sum on Bill or Note Payable on Demand, or at any time le&s;s than Six Months from Borrowing thereof.</HI></P>
<P>Now I &s;han't trouble you or my &s;elf, to Argue how far this Projection would be a Breach upon the Con&s;titution of the <HI>Bank of England</HI>; yet I think it is very fair and ea&s;y to ob&s;erve, that &s;o great a Number of Per|&s;ons, as our Projectors con&s;i&s;t of, may by no Means, without a &s;ufficient Power fir&s;t had, pre&s;ume to Make or I&s;&s;ue the&s;e their Joynt <HI>Bills</HI> or <HI>Notes.</HI> For certainly, if the &s;ame Fact committed in <HI>England,</HI> by a Number exceed|ing Six, would be a breach of Law, much more may we &s;uppo&s;e it forbidden and made Unlawful for an Hundred to do it here.</P>
<P>We frequently meet in our <HI>Law-Books,</HI> with Informations in the Nature of <HI>Quo Warrantos</HI> again&s;t Corporations, and Bodies Politick, for U&s;urping Powers, Franchi&s;es and Liberties not belonging to them; or for abu&s;ing and acting contrary to tho&s;e that do. And the
<PB N="13" REF="001675_0012_0fb4e10ba5c2c368">
Defence generally made in tho&s;e Ca&s;es, has been Founded on their &s;everal <HI>Charters.</HI> But now &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch an Information were Or|dered to be brought again&s;t the&s;e Projectors, what Defence in the Law could po&s;&s;ibly be made by them, or for them?</P>
<P>I now proceed to the next General Head which I propo&s;ed, and that is, How far the Government, and the very Con&s;titution of this Province may be affected by, and there|fore ought thoroly to Inform them&s;elves about this Projection: And I think nothing can be plainer, than that the <HI>General A&s;&s;embly</HI> of the Province, are under a nece&s;&s;ity of En|quiring into the Legality, the Ju&s;tice, the Safety, and Publick Advantage of this <HI>Bank,</HI> and if judged otherwi&s;e; by &s;ome proper Act, or Publick Order to Declare again&s;t, and forbid it, until His Maje&s;ties Plea&s;ure may be known upon it. And as no wi&s;e Man, or good Subject can que&s;tion the Power or Ju|&s;tice of the Government in &s;o doing, &s;o 'tis much to be feared on the other Hand, in Ca&s;e they &s;hould be wholly Silent, they might be called in Que&s;tion at Home, for any ill Con&s;equences of their Neglect therein: For I can't agree by any means with tho&s;e Gen|tlemen that Argue, Becau&s;e the <HI>Bank</HI> is Pri|vate, and the Government as &s;uch not In|tere&s;ted
<PB N="14" REF="001675_0013_0fb4e10c8c27f040">
Intere&s;ted in it, that the whole Blame and Da|mage will fall on the Projectors. Can it be Imagined, that when this Affair has been &s;o Publick, the Government Notified of it &s;o Effectually, and the Projection it &s;elf of &s;o high and extraordinary a Nature, That upon the whole, no Account will be demanded by His Maje&s;ty of the Government, what Me|thods they took upon this Occa&s;ion, to &s;ecure the Honour of the Crown, and the Safety of the Subject. But be that as it will, I think it very Unrea&s;onable, and ab&s;olutely Incon|&s;i&s;tent with the Honour, the Power, and Wi&s;dom of this Government, to &s;uffer any Projection what&s;oever, tho' otherwi&s;e never &s;o well Framed, to be &s;et up and carried on, and they have no Advice about it, no Au|thority over it, nor &s;o much as a Power to Redeem it, in ca&s;e they &s;ee good. This will be in effect, to &s;uffer a Number of their own People to &s;et up an ab&s;olute Independent Go|vernment, which like a Fire in the Bowels, will Burn up and Con&s;ume the whole Body. If &s;uch things as the&s;e may be Tolerated, 'twill be a vain thing any longer to talk of Government, a Power of making Laws, Re|gulating Trade, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> For they that can make at one Da&s;h, the Sum beforementioned, and as much more when they plea&s;e, will quickly Govern the Trading part, and by degrees
<PB N="15" REF="001675_0014_0fb4e1137925e5e8">
get the Land, of the Country Mortgaged to them, and &s;o at length bear down the Go|vernment it &s;elf, <HI>and nothing be re&s;trained from them.</HI> For which Rea&s;on I hope, and doubt not, but that the <HI>General A&s;&s;embly</HI> of the Pro|vince, will upon this great Occa&s;ion, exert their proper Powers, as they have once and again heretofore, when they have been under any apprehen&s;ions of Danger, either to the Government, or the Publick Good. Two notable In&s;tances whereof you'll find in the <HI>Memorial,</HI> one with re&s;pect to the making of Money, and the other of a Partner&s;hip or Company, both which are Publi&s;hed among the Printed Acts.</P>
<P>As to the Act of Parliament of the Sixth of the late Queen beforementioned, the Act of Parliament of late al&s;o made referring to Money in the Plantations, the &s;everal Laws of our own Province, with re&s;pect to Mo|ney, and the Intere&s;t of it; as al&s;o tho&s;e that concern the <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> E&s;tabli&s;hed on the Province; all of which will more or le&s;s be Affected, Invalidated, and broke in upon by this Projection. I have taken &s;o much No|tice of them in the <HI>Memorial,</HI> that I &s;hall for|bear &s;aying any thing more on that Head here, &s;ave only to Remark, That as the <HI>Ge|neral Court</HI> or <HI>A&s;&s;embly</HI> of the Province, &s;o
<PB N="16" REF="001675_0015_0fb4e114e533c208">
certainly no particular Number of Per&s;ons in a Company or Partner&s;hip, can Pretend, or mu&s;t Pre&s;ume to In&s;titute or E&s;tabli&s;h any thing Repugnant to the Laws of <HI>England.</HI> And &s;o I pa&s;s on, in the la&s;t Place to Con|&s;ider the Frame and Nature of this <HI>Laudable Projection,</HI> as &s;ome are plea&s;ed to call it; and my Objections to it are &s;uch as the&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> Its ab&s;olute Independency on the Government, either as to its Regulation, or the power of Redemption; which, as I ob|&s;erved before, is a thing Intolerable, and without Precedent, and never &s;o much as entred into the Minds of the Projectors of the Great <HI>Bank of England</HI> to Ask, much le&s;s of the Government to Grant.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> I cannot &s;ee the Rea&s;onablene&s;s and Ju&s;tice of it, betwixt the Sub&s;cribers and Borrowers: For, as I have Remarked already, the Sub&s;cribers are obliged to take out but a Quarter part of their Sub&s;criptions, the other three Quarters is to be Let out at four <HI>per Cent.</HI> Intere&s;t, upon good Security. Now, according to the common cour&s;e of Intere&s;t, in le&s;s than Twenty Years, and if the Com|pany &s;hall plea&s;e, by i&s;&s;uing out a greater Quantity of <HI>Bills,</HI> in a third part of that Time, the Sub&s;cribers will have cleared their
<PB N="17" REF="001675_0016_0fb4e1164c1f0ed0">
own Mortgages, draw out their own Stakes, and &s;o have the Intere&s;t of the whole to &s;hare among them&s;elves, and the <HI>Bubbled Bor|rowers</HI> pay Intere&s;t for their own E&s;tates. Pray where's the Ju&s;tice of this? Why &s;hould not the Borrowers when it comes to that, have &s;ome of the Profits of the <HI>Bank,</HI> when their E&s;tates are the only remaining Fund? I con|fe&s;s, it may &s;eem a very ea&s;y and &s;hort Way of getting an E&s;tate; but &s;ure no Projection can expect to Succeed, that is not Founded in Commutative Ju&s;tice and Common Ho|ne&s;ty.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be glad to know of the&s;e Gentle|men, that pretend to be &s;o Publick Spirited in this Bu&s;ine&s;s, whether they could be Con|tented, and have the fame Opinion of this <HI>Bank,</HI> if their Names were taken out of the Policy, and an equal Number of others put in, and I &s;uppo&s;e, without any Reflection, as Good may be found, and &s;o in&s;tead of be|ing Lenders, they would become Borrowers of the&s;e <HI>Bank-Bills?</HI> I am afraid not! For the Bu&s;ine&s;s is, and very good Bu&s;ine&s;s it would be, in one Day to be Ma&s;ters of 150000 <HI>l.</HI> and without any Ri&s;que at all, or any other Charge or Trouble, except the Printing and Signing a few pieces of Paper, to accept of Six Thou&s;and Pounds <HI>per Annum</HI> Intere&s;t: By
<PB N="18" REF="001675_0017_0fb4e11b86c6f088">
which Method, in effect, the Projectors would immediately have the Profits of other Mens E&s;tates; and finally, as the Matter may be managed, the E&s;tates them&s;elves, without a valuable Con&s;ideration; their <HI>Bank-Bills</HI> be|ing but pieces of Paper that have no other Value, but what the Borrowers give them. And yet we are made to believe, that the Bor|rowers are well dealt with, if tho' they pay Intere&s;t, yet they may at la&s;t have their own E&s;tates or Pawns back again, upon bringing in the Bills. If this be not the <HI>Philo&s;opher's Stone,</HI> there is no &s;uch thing in the World.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly.</HI> It mu&s;t, I think, unavoidably prove a great Snare and Mi&s;chief to People that want Money to pay their Debts or otherwi&s;e, for who&s;e Ea&s;e and Advantage neverthele&s;s the <HI>Bank</HI> is Projected: As for Example; A Man owes me one Hundred Pounds upon Bond, in the <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> of the Province, and very readily pays me Six <HI>per Cent.</HI> Intere&s;t; to Di&s;charge which, he repairs to the <HI>Bank,</HI> and Borrows 100 <HI>l.</HI> in their <HI>Bills,</HI> and comes to take up his Bond: Can any Man in Pru|dence or Ju&s;tice think, that I &s;hall take one Hundred Pounds in <HI>Bank-Bills,</HI> that will fetch but Four <HI>per Cent.</HI> for one Hundred Pounds in <HI>Province-Bills,</HI> that People &s;o willingly give Six <HI>per Cent.</HI> for? No &s;ure. I mu&s;t at lea&s;t
<PB N="19" REF="001675_0018_0fb4e11dfad81a28">
have as many of the <HI>Bank-Bills,</HI> as will fetch Six <HI>per Cent.</HI> And if the <HI>Bankers</HI> &s;hould out of their great Genero&s;ity, and in Compa&s;&s;ion as they pretend to &s;uch as want Money, Let their Intere&s;t at three, or two <HI>per Cent.</HI> Inte|re&s;t, the Ca&s;e would be &s;o much the wor&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly.</HI> What Security will the la&s;t Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or of the&s;e <HI>Bills</HI> have to depend upon, in ca&s;e this <HI>Bank</HI> &s;hould be broke up, either by the Government, or its &s;elf? As for Exam|ple: A Man has one Thou&s;and Pounds of 'em by him; what &s;hall he do with 'em, when the Credit of 'em is come to nothing? For, by the Tenour of the <HI>Bills,</HI> as you &s;ee, they are only obliged to accept of 'em for the Re|demption of Pawns or Mortgages; and this Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or has neither to take up. Po&s;&s;ibly you'll &s;ay the <HI>Bankers</HI> will A&s;&s;ign him over a Mort|gage: To that I an&s;wer, That the Founda|tion being gone, every thing el&s;e will fall with it. I doubt our Courts would never Adjudge tho&s;e Mortgages to be good in the Law, being for no Valuable Con&s;ideration, &s;o that the Lands &s;o Mortgaged, would Re|vert to the Original Owners, like the Year of <HI>Jubilee</HI> among the <HI>Jews.</HI> And then as to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors Suing of the Company to make good their <HI>Bills,</HI> fir&s;t there will be no &s;uch thing in ca&s;e they be Di&s;&s;olved by Order of
<PB N="20" REF="001675_0019_0fb4e1229d6c5558">
Government; &s;econdly, If in the other Ca&s;e, it &s;hould &s;ink of it felf, they may prove In&s;olvent, and &s;o the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or be finely <HI>Lurched</HI>: For which Rea&s;on, all Wi&s;e Men will be afraid to meddle with them, or be &s;ure to get rid of them as fa&s;t as they can.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly.</HI> The Name and Stile of this Pro|jection, is a <HI>Bank of Credit</HI>: Now I take it for a certain Rule, That no <HI>Money-Bank,</HI> as we may call it, can or will po&s;&s;ibly have any <HI>Credit</HI> that is not Equal, either Really, or in Reputation, to the True or common Current Money of the Country, or Place where &s;uch <HI>Bank</HI> is Erected: And You may depend upon it, <HI>SIR,</HI> That if the <HI>Bills</HI> of the <HI>Bank of Eng|land</HI> it &s;elf were not looked upon as good as <HI>Specie,</HI> and in effect a <HI>Money-Bank,</HI> the Credit of 'em would quickly come to nothing. For which Purpo&s;e there are always kept in the Office of the &s;aid <HI>Bank</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> va&s;t Sums of <HI>Silver</HI> and <HI>Gold,</HI> to Exchange for their <HI>Bills</HI> to any one that demands it. Be&s;ides which, the <HI>Exchequer,</HI> as you may &s;ee fre|quently by the <HI>London-Gazett,</HI> is always ready for that End to A&s;&s;i&s;t 'em with whatever Sums they may have Occa&s;ion for. But now our Projectors don't &s;o much as pretend to have the lea&s;t Doight of <HI>Silver</HI> or <HI>Gold,</HI> or even a Stock of <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> of this Province
<PB N="21" REF="001675_0020_0fb4e1264ecc9ad0">
to An&s;wer, in Ca&s;e of Nece&s;&s;ity, or to &s;up|port the Credit of their <HI>Bills</HI> withal. And I am &s;ure they have no rea&s;on to expect the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Government upon any Emergency, &s;ince as yet, they have not &s;o much as Con&s;ulted them in the whole Affair.</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly.</HI> I cannot but think, the Making and I&s;&s;uing &s;o great a Quantity of the&s;e <HI>Bank-Bills,</HI> will be attended with a great deal of Mi&s;chief and Confu&s;ion as to Money in General: Now Money is of the greate&s;t Importance, and la&s;t Con&s;equence to a <HI>Com|mon-Wealth</HI>; for as 'tis the Sinews of <HI>War,</HI> &s;o 'tis the Strength of <HI>Peace</HI>: For which Rea&s;on, we can't have too much of that which really is Money, but we may very ea&s;ily have too much of that which is not &s;o.</P>
<P>The poore&s;t Country-Man in the Province, is not convinced to this Day, but that <HI>Silver,</HI> tho' never &s;o Rough and Unpoli&s;hed, is pre|ferable to the fine&s;t <HI>Paper-Money</HI> that ever was &s;een. We have had too much Confu&s;ion already in the Province, by the Difference that has been made between <HI>Silver-Money</HI> and our Publick <HI>Bills of Credit,</HI> (when yet they were Supported by the Government) and are hardly got over it to this Day. But into what
<PB N="22" REF="001675_0021_0fb4e127817faac0">
a Gulph of Mi&s;ery by <HI>Stock-jobbing</HI> Difference of Money, and innumerable other Mi&s;chiefs &s;hall we be plunged think you, when &s;uch a Flood of Private <HI>Paper-Money</HI> comes to be poured out among us? 'Tis now more than Twelve Years &s;ince the Government fir&s;t began to Make and I&s;&s;ue the <HI>Bills of Credit</HI>; and tho' the Occa&s;ions and Nece&s;&s;ities of the Province have been very Pre&s;&s;ing and Urgent, yet in all that time, they have made but about Two Hundred and Forty Thou&s;and Pounds: But as if that were a &s;mall Thing, our Gentlemen propo&s;e at once to Make and I&s;&s;ue out 200000 <HI>l.</HI> And by the &s;ame Rea&s;on that a <HI>Bank</HI> is &s;et up in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> &s;everal others may go on in the &s;everal parts of the Province; and what can the Con&s;equence of this be, but to Confound the People, and make Money Vile and Contemptible; and as much as in them lies, to Alter and De&s;troy the very Nature of Money? So that in&s;tead of An&s;wering all things, as it has always done, and ought to do, it will now An&s;wer nothing, and be wor&s;e than every thing el&s;e; For that which really makes the Value of Money, among other things, is its Rarity: So that upon the whole, the Remedy pro|po&s;ed by the&s;e Projectors, will be much wor&s;e than the Di&s;ea&s;e. As to the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Trade, for the Ea&s;e, Benefit, and Advantage whereof
<PB N="23" REF="001675_0022_0fb4e1290d20d318">
this Wonderful <HI>Bank</HI> is Projected, it would be well Con&s;idered, Fir&s;t, Whether we have not generally run upon too much Trade for our Profit, already? For if I am not mi&s;taken, tho' I am no Merchant, the greatne&s;s of the Credit given in Trade, has in a great Mea&s;ure, brought this want of Money upon us.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, as to the Encouraging the Pro|duce of our own Country, and our own Manufactures, the Exporting of our own Commodities we cannot well exceed; but if we Import from Abroad, more than we can Pay for, by what we Produce our &s;elves, or Purcha&s;e from others with our own Commo|dities, we &s;hall unavoidably grow Poor, and a Million of <HI>Paper-Money</HI> won't help the matter at all: So that the le&s;s we Import from Abroad, the le&s;s Money or Medium of Ex|change, the Trading part will want. And here indeed has been our great Improvidence and Unhappine&s;s in this Country, (of late Years e&s;pecially) that the greate&s;t part of our Con&s;umption in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and other Sea-port Towns, almo&s;t to Food and Raiment, has been of Foreign Commodities, when the &s;ame things might be rai&s;ed among our &s;elves, were the Produce of our own Country Encouraged, at lea&s;t, &s;o much as to make a Ballance of Trade in our Favour. Be&s;ides all which, I
<PB N="24" REF="001675_0023_0fb4e13002c6ad98">
cannot but think it the Duty and Intere&s;t of our Merchants and Traders, who have been the great Occa&s;ion of the Lo&s;s of our <HI>Silver,</HI> to Project &s;ome way of Recovering it again, and manage the Trade, &s;o as that a good Proportion of <HI>Silver</HI> and <HI>Gold</HI> might once more find the way into <HI>New-England,</HI> and there remain for the Honour and Service of the Government and Country, who have Suffered and been Expo&s;ed too much already for want of it; and had not the ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of the Government and People Re|quired it, it had been better (in the Opinion of many Wi&s;e Men) for the Province, they had never made any <HI>Bills,</HI> or <HI>Paper-Money</HI> at all.</P>
<P>I might al&s;o mention the great Extrava|gance that People, and e&s;pecially the Ordinary &s;ort, are fallen into, far beyond their Circum|&s;tances, in their Purcha&s;es, Buildings, Fami|lies, Expences, Apparel, and generally in their whole way of Living: And above all, the exce&s;&s;ive Con&s;umption of <HI>Rhum</HI> and <HI>Wine,</HI> as one of the greate&s;t Sources and Cau&s;es of the pre&s;ent Di&s;tre&s;s: Hereupon it mu&s;t be granted by every one of common Sen&s;e and Ob&s;erva|tion, That if the Importation of Foreign Commodities were le&s;s, and e&s;pecially tho&s;e
<PB N="25" REF="001675_0024_0fb4e131467b7c20">
two Branches beforementioned, <HI>viz. Rhum</HI> and <HI>Wine</HI> Reduced to what only might be Ne|ce&s;&s;ary. Were but a tolerable Proportion of <HI>Silver</HI> brought in to us, which might be effected with Ea&s;e and Profit, were Frugality and good Husbandry Univer&s;ally in Fa&s;hion among us, there would not be &s;uch a Clamour for want of a <HI>Medium</HI> of Exchange. I con|fe&s;s, as things are at pre&s;ent Managed and Circum&s;tanced among us, both <HI>Silver</HI> and <HI>Paper-Money</HI> is become very &s;carce; tho' really more in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and among the Trading part, than in Proportion, in the other parts of the Province. And the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion of the <HI>General A&s;&s;embly,</HI> when I had the Honour to be one of an Extraordinary <HI>Committee</HI> rai&s;ed for that Purpo&s;e; I gave it as my Opinion, <HI>That con|&s;idering the Demand of the Government as to the Taxes, and the great Occa&s;ions of the People as to their Trade, it might be convenient to Make and I&s;&s;ue out a further Quanty of the Publick</HI> Bills of Credit, <HI>&amp;c. in &s;uch a Method as was then agreed on</HI>: And of the &s;ame Opinion were all of that <HI>Committee,</HI> &s;ave Two, as I Remember, and they con&s;i&s;ted of Thirteen: And accordingly a Report was made by the <HI>Chair-Man,</HI> in the Name of the re&s;t. But how that Matter dropt when it came into the <HI>Lower Hou&s;e,</HI> I &s;hall not take upon me here to &s;ay, tho' it may ea&s;ily be gue&s;&s;ed at. However, I per&s;wade my
<PB N="26" REF="001675_0025_0fb4e133304f7e20">
&s;elf, that when the <HI>General A&s;&s;embly</HI> comes to Review that <HI>Report,</HI> the Scheme then Agreed, will be found the be&s;t, if not the only Expe|dient to Relieve the pre&s;ent Di&s;tre&s;s; and the Gentlemen that Oppo&s;e it, will I'm Con|fident, have no Thanks from tho&s;e they Repre&s;ent.</P>
<P><HI>SIR,</HI> I do not pretend in all, or any thing that I have &s;aid, to be again&s;t a <HI>Bank of Credit</HI> in General, were it well Founded, well Limited, and Regulated by the Govern|ment, and Equal to our own <HI>Current-Money,</HI> as &s;uch a <HI>Bank</HI> ought to be: But I am utterly again&s;t this pre&s;ent Projection, for the Rea|&s;ons I have given, and many others that might be Mentioned: And &s;ince, as I &s;aid before, and I really am of that Opinion, That there is a Nece&s;&s;ity of Supplying the People with a further convenient Quantity of <HI>Bills of Credit,</HI> for the better Payment of their <HI>Taxes,</HI> and the ea&s;e of Trade. I am ab&s;olutely for its being done by the Publick, and for &s;uch Rea&s;ons as the&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> We have, had Twelve Years Experi|ence already of the <HI>Publick Bills,</HI> with great Honour, Safety, and Succe&s;s; Whereas the Private Projection, is a Path that has never yet been Trod, and what the Con&s;equences may be, we don't know.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="001675_0026_0fb4e1350ba67ba0"><HI>Secondly.</HI> The <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> upon the Pro|vince, are Equal even to Seventeen Penny half-penny Weight, as to the Publick Tax, and by a late Act of the <HI>General A&s;&s;embly,</HI> they are made a good Tender in the Law, as to all Debts Contracted in the Common Cour&s;e of Trade, and by that means upon the Matter, made of an Intrin&s;ick Value, and &s;o the Credit of 'em Firm and Nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly.</HI> The Profits in Ca&s;e the Govern|ment I&s;&s;ue the <HI>Bills,</HI> will always Redound to the Publick, and &s;o every one will have a Benefit thereby. And again, we may rea&s;on|ably &s;uppo&s;e, that the Government would be more Sparing and Cautious, and not &s;o Lavi&s;h in Launching out their <HI>Bills,</HI> as a Private <HI>Bank</HI> would be, not being under the like Tempta|tion: By which means the Credit of the <HI>Bills</HI> would be the better pre&s;erved. Be&s;ides which, the Province has once and again made good Counterfeits, and further provided again&s;t 'em, as you may &s;ee by a Private Act made in the Third Year of the late Reign, and a Publick Act made the very la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion of the <HI>A&s;&s;embly</HI>: Whereas there is no Provi&s;ion at all again&s;t Counterfeits in this Private Projection. And to mention no more upon this Head, the Fund of the Publick <HI>Bills of Credit,</HI> being the Province in General, according to the ordi|nary Cour&s;e of Things, can never be doubted, or in Danger.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="001675_0027_0fb4e1390baf41b8">I know very well what the <HI>Bankers</HI> Object to all this, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> That as by the Con&s;titution, it is in the Power of the <HI>Governour</HI> and <HI>Council</HI> to draw out the Publick Money, &s;o it would be much more in His Power to lay His Hand on the Money &s;o made and Let out, it being not rai&s;ed for His Maje&s;ties U&s;e, and Appropri|ated, and thereby Endanger the Liberties of the People. To this I An&s;wer, Fir&s;t, That according to the Scheme agreed on, and Re|ported by the <HI>Committee,</HI> The Principal and Profits of that Money were &s;o Settled and Secured, that nothing le&s;s than the <HI>General A&s;&s;embly</HI> could Di&s;po&s;e of either. Secondly. As the Projectors have Ordered their <HI>Bank,</HI> 2000 <HI>l.</HI> of their Yearly Profits they de&s;ign to pre&s;ent to the Government: Now what they mean by that, is uncertain. Fir&s;t, If they mean a Governour that they &s;hall plea&s;e to like, I'm &s;ure it would be a very effectual way to En&s;lave this Country, by an under|&s;tanding between &s;uch Governour and the <HI>Bank.</HI> Secondly. If they intend the <HI>General A&s;&s;embly,</HI> then I &s;ay as in the <HI>Memorial,</HI> That this Government neither can nor ought to be Maintained in any other Method, than by the <HI>Charter,</HI> and In&s;tructions from the <HI>Crown.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> That the Government have no Power to do any &s;uch thing, as to Make and
<PB N="29" REF="001675_0028_0fb4e13add217d30">
Lend out any <HI>Publick Bills</HI>; but with what De&s;ign they make, and how well they En|force this Objection, I leave the World to Judge, and with their Favour, I &s;hould think the <HI>General A&s;&s;embly</HI> as Capable of knowing and under&s;tanding their own Powers, as the Projectors for 'em. I am &s;ure it was the Opi|nion of the <HI>Committee</HI> beforementioned, That the <HI>General A&s;&s;embly</HI> of the Province, were &s;ufficiently Impowered by the <HI>Charter,</HI> when|ever the nece&s;&s;ary Support of the Government required it, to Make and I&s;&s;ue the&s;e <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> in the Method then propo&s;ed. And their Opinion was Founded upon that Clau&s;e in the <HI>Charter,</HI> referring to impo&s;ing rea&s;onable <HI>A&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ments, Taxes, &amp;c. In the nece&s;&s;ary Defence and Support of the Government, and the Protection, and Pre&s;ervation of the Inhabitants there,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Now Fir&s;t, There's nothing in the <HI>Charter</HI> Repugnant to the Governments I&s;&s;uing a fur|ther Sum of <HI>Bills.</HI> Secondly, It has been done, once and again, upon great Occa&s;ions, and the Government not blamed for it, that I know of. Thirdly, If the nece&s;&s;ary Support of the Go|vernment of this Province, and the Pre&s;erva|tion of the People, (for tho&s;e are the Words of the <HI>Charter</HI>) require the Making and I&s;&s;uing a further Quantity, then 'tis directly within, and well Warranted by the <HI>Charter.</HI> Now I think we are all agreed in this, That neither
<PB N="30" REF="001675_0029_0fb4e13d99d649d0">
the Government nor People (as to their Trade and Bu&s;ine&s;s) can well be Supported and carry on their nece&s;&s;ary Affairs much longer, without a further Supply of Money, or <HI>Bills of Credit.</HI> Be&s;ides which, the Projectors would do well to tell us, how it comes to pa&s;s, that they &s;hould have &s;o great a Power of Sup|plying the People with Money, and the <HI>Ge|neral A&s;&s;embly</HI> have none at all. But certainly, if the <HI>Bankers</HI> are &s;o wi&s;e and Cautious as to the Powers of the Government, for fear they &s;hould be exceeded, and the Con&s;titution thereby Endangered; it much more behoves the <HI>General A&s;&s;embly</HI> of the Province, to Ex|erci&s;e this Caution, with re&s;pect to this Pro|jection, and effectually &s;ecure the Honour and Safety of the Government, the E&s;tates and Liberties of the People, which is the very thing I Contend for, And that which Com|forts me in what I have &s;aid and done upon this Occa&s;ion, whatever the Event prove, is, That I have had no Private View, or Sepe|rate Intere&s;t, much le&s;s any Prejudice to the Gentlemen concerned; among whom I have many particular Friends; but have Sincerely aim'd at the Publick Good. <HI>SIR,</HI> It was the Excellent Character of the Heads of the Tribe of <HI>I&s;&s;achar,</HI> in <HI>David's</HI> Time, and Re|corded for their Honour, and our Imitation, That they were Men of Under&s;tanding in the

<P>SINCE the Date and Delivery of this Letter, I under&s;tand the <HI>Bankers</HI> have new Modelled their Projection, and Reformed it, as they reckon, in two Articles; But how long this new Scheme will hold, is uncertain, Fir&s;t. In&s;tead of Four,
<PB N="32" REF="001675_0031_0fb4e141017955a8">
they now propo&s;e to have Five <HI>per Cent.</HI> Inte|re&s;t; but they would do well to tell us by what Law, or with what Ju&s;tice they can pretend to ask or receive one <HI>per Cent.</HI> or indeed any In|tere&s;t at all, for their own <HI>Bills,</HI> which (as be|fore is ob&s;erved) are nothing in them&s;elves, have not the Foundation, the Advantage and Value of the Publick <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> on the Pro|vince, nor ever can without the Government, and mu&s;t be wholly obliged to the Borrowers for their pre&s;ent worth or Currency. And I be|lieve this is the fir&s;t time that ever Intere&s;t was asked for any &s;ort of Money or Bills that had not the Stamp or Authority of a Government.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> They have Reformed the Fund al&s;o, in ob|liging the Sub&s;cribers to give in Real Security, to the Value of 200000 <HI>l.</HI> the full Sum of the Bills propo&s;ed to be made, and &s;o not to be obliged to the Bor|rowers for any part of the Fund.
