love for the public good, a profound reverence for the laws, a contempt of riches, and a noble haughtine&s;s of &s;oul, are the only foundations of a free government.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">ABBE MABLE.</NOTE> Do not the&s;e dignified principles &s;till exi&s;t among us? Or are they extingui&s;hed in the brea&s;ts of Americans, who&s;e fields have been &s;o recently crim&s;oned to repel the potent arm of a foreign Monarch, who had planted his en&s;igns of &s;lavery in every city, with de&s;ign to era&s;e the ve&s;tiges of freedom in this his la&s;t a&s;ylum. It is yet to be hoped, for the honour of human nature, that no com|binations, either foreign or dome&s;tic, have thus darkened this We&s;tern hemi&s;phere. On the&s;e &s;hores freedom has planted her &s;tandard, dipped in the purple tide that flowed from the veins of her martyred heroes; and here every uncorrupted American yet hopes to &s;ee it &s;upported by the vigour, the ju&s;tice, the wi&s;dom, and unanimity of the peo|ple, in &s;pite of the deep-laid plots, the &s;ecret intrigues, or the bold effrontery of tho&s;e intere&s;ted and avaricious adven|turers for place, who, intoxicated with ideas of di&s;tinction and preferment, have pro&s;trated every worthy principle beneath the &s;hrine of ambition. Yet the&s;e are the men who tell us, republicani&s;m is dwindled into theory&mdash;that we are incapable of enjoying our liberties&mdash;and that we mu&s;t have a ma&s;ter. Let us retro&s;pect the days of our ad|ver&s;ity, and recollect who were then our friends; do we find them among the &s;ticklers for ari&s;tocratic authority? No&mdash;they were generally the &s;ame men who now wi&s;h to &s;ave us from the di&s;tractions of anarchy on the one hand, and the jaws of tyranny on the other; where then were the cla&s;s who now come forth importunately urging that our political &s;alvation depends on the adoption of a &s;y&s;|tem at which freedom &s;purns? Were not &s;ome of them hidden in the corners or ob&s;curity, and others wrapping them&s;elves in the bo&s;om of our enemies for &s;afety? Some of them were in the arms of infancy, and others &s;peculat|ing for fortune, by &s;porting with public money, while a few, a very few of them were magnanimou&s;ly defending their country, and rai&s;ing a character which I pray hea|ven may never be &s;ullied by aiding mea&s;ures derogatory to their former exertions. But the revolutions in princi|ple which time produces among mankind, frequently ex|hibit the mo&s;t mortifying in&s;tances of human weakne&s;s;

and this alone can account for the extraordinary appear|ance of a few names, once di&s;tingui&s;hed in the honorable walks of patrioti&s;m, but now found on the li&s;t of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts a&s;&s;ent to the ratification of a Con&s;titution, which, by the undefined meaning of &s;ome parts, and the ambiguities of expre&s;&s;ion in others, is dangerou&s;ly adapt|ed to the purpo&s;es of an immediate <HI>ari&s;tocratic tyranny</HI>; that from the difficulty, if not impracticability of its ope|ration, mu&s;t &s;oon terminate in the mo&s;t <HI>uncontrouled de&s;|poti&s;m.</HI></P>
<P>All writers on government agree, and the feelings of the human mind witne&s;&s;es the truth of the&s;e political axioms, that man is born free, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of certain un|alienable rights&mdash;that government is in&s;tituted for the protection, &s;afety, and happine&s;s of the people, and not for the profit, honour, or private intere&s;t of any man, fa|mily, or cla&s;s of men. That the origin of all power is in the people, and that they have an inconte&s;tible right to check the creatures of their own creation, ve&s;ted with certain powers to guard the life, liberty, and property of the community: And if certain &s;elected bodies of men, deputed on the&s;e principles, determine contrary to the wi&s;hes and expectations of their con&s;tituents, the people have an undoubted right to reject their deci&s;ions, to call for a revi&s;ion of their conduct, to depute others in their room, or, if they think proper, to demand further time for deliberation on matters, of the greate&s;t moment: it there|fore is an unwarrantable &s;tretch of authority or influence, if any methods are taken to preclude this rea&s;onable and peaceful mode of enquiry and deci&s;ion. And it is with inexpre&s;&s;ible anxiety, that many of the be&s;t friends to the Union&mdash;to the peaceable and equal participation of the rights of nature, and to the glory and dignity of this coun|try, behold the in&s;idious arts, and the &s;trenuous efforts of the parti&s;ans of arbitrary power, by their vague defini|tions of the be&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed truths, endeavouring to en|velope the mind in darkne&s;s&mdash;the concomitant of &s;lavery; and to lock the &s;trong chains of dome&s;tic de&s;poti&s;m on a country, which, by the mo&s;t glorious and &s;ucce&s;sful &s;trug|gles, is but newly emancipated from the &s;ceptre of foreign dominion.

&s;ee &s;uch a pa&s;&s;ive di&s;po&s;ition prevail in &s;ome, who we mu&s;t candidly &s;uppo&s;e have liberal and enlarged &s;entiments; while a &s;upple multitude are paying a blind and idolatrous homage to the opinions of tho&s;e, who, by the mo&s;t preci|pitate &s;teps, are treading down their dear-bought privi|leges, and who are endeavouring, by all the arts of in&s;inu|ation and influence, to betray the people of the United States into an acceptance of a mo&s;t complicated &s;y&s;tem of government, marked on the one &s;ide with the <HI>dark, &s;ecret,</HI> and <HI>profound intrigues</HI> of the &s;tate&s;man, long practi&s;ed in the purlieus of de&s;poti&s;m; and on the other, with the ideal projects of <HI>young ambition,</HI> with its wings ju&s;t ex|panded to &s;oar to a &s;ummit which imagination has painted in &s;uch gawdy colours as to intoxicate the <HI>inexperienced votary,</HI> and &s;end <HI>him</HI> rambling from State to State, to col|lect materials to con&s;truct the ladder of preferment.</P>
<P>But as a variety of objections to the <HI>heterogeneous phan|tom,</HI> have been repeatedly laid before the public, by men of the be&s;t abilities and intentions, I will not ex|patiate long on a Republican <HI>form</HI> of government, found|ed on the principles of monarchy&mdash;a democratic branch with the <HI>features</HI> of ari&s;tocracy&mdash;and the extravagance of nobility pervading the minds of many of the candidates for office, with the poverty of pea&s;antry hanging heavily on them, and in&s;urmountable, from their ta&s;te for expence, unle&s;s a generous provi&s;ion &s;hould be made in the arrange|ment of the civil li&s;t, which may enable them with the champions of their cau&s;e, to "<HI>&s;ail down the new Pactolean channel.</HI>" Some gentlemen, with laboured zeal, have &s;pent much time in urging the nece&s;&s;ity of government, from the embarra&s;&s;ments of trade&mdash;the want of re&s;pectability abroad, and confidence in the public engagements at home: The&s;e are obvious truths which no one denies; and there are few who do not unite in the general wi&s;h for the re&s;toration of public faith, the revival of commerce, arts, agriculture, and indu&s;try, under a lenient, peaceable, and energetic government: But the mo&s;t &s;agacious advocates for the par|ty have not, by fair di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and rational argumentation, evinced the nece&s;&s;ity of adopting this many-headed mon|&s;ter; of &s;uch motley mixture, that its enemies cannot trace a feature of Democratic or Republican extract; nor have its friends the courage to denominate it a Monarchy, an Ari&s;tocracy, or an Oligarchy, and the favoured bantling mu&s;t have pa&s;&s;ed through the &s;hort period of its exi&s;tence

without a name, had not Mr. <HI>Wil&s;on,</HI> in the fertility of his genius, &s;ugge&s;ted the happy epithet of a <HI>Federal Republic.</HI> But I leave the field of general cen&s;ure on the &s;ecrecy of its birth, the rapidity of its growth, and the fatal con&s;e|quences of &s;uffering it to live to the age of maturity, and will particularize &s;ome of the mo&s;t weighty objections to its pa&s;&s;ing through this continent in a gigantic &s;ize.&mdash;It will be allowed by every one, that the fundamental princi|ple of a free government, is the equal repre&s;entation of a free people.&mdash;And I will <HI>fir&s;t</HI> ob&s;erve with a ju&s;tly ce|lebrated writer,
<Q>That the principle aim of &s;ociety is to protect individuals in the ab&s;olute rights which were ve&s;ted in them by the immediate laws of nature, but which could not be pre&s;erved in peace, without the mutual intercour&s;e which is gained by the in&s;titution of friendly and &s;ocial communities.</Q>
&mdash;And when &s;ociety has thus deputed a certain number of their equals to take care of their per&s;onal rights, and the intere&s;t of the whole community, it mu&s;t be con&s;idered that re&s;pon&s;ibility is the great &s;ecurity of integrity and honour; and that annual e|lection is the ba&s;is of re&s;pon&s;ibility.&mdash;Man is not immedi|ately corrupted, but power, without limitation, or amean|ability, may endanger the brighte&s;t virtue&mdash;whereas a fre|quent return to the bar of their con&s;tituents is the &s;trong|e&s;t check again&s;t the corruptions to which men are liable, either from the intrigues of others of more &s;ubtil genius, or the propen&s;ities of their own hearts&mdash;and the gentlemen who have &s;o warmly advocated in the late Convention of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts,</HI> the change from annual to biennial elec|tions; may have been in the &s;ame predicament, and per|haps with the &s;ame views that Mr. <HI>Hutchin&s;on</HI> once ac|knowledged him&s;elf, when in a letter to Lord <HI>Hill&s;borough</HI> he ob&s;erved,
<Q>that the grand difficulty of making a change in government again&s;t the general bent of the people had cau&s;ed him to turn his thoughts to a variety of plans, in order to find one that might be executed in &s;pite of oppo&s;ition,</Q>
and the fir&s;t he propo&s;ed was, that "in&s;tead of annual, the elections &s;hould be only once in three years:" But the mini&s;ter had not the hardine&s;s to attempt &s;uch an innovation, even in the revi&s;ion of colonial char|ters: Nor has any one ever defended biennial, triennial, or &s;eptennial elections, either in the Briti&s;h hou&s;e of com|mons, or in the debates of provincial a&s;&s;emblies, on general and free principles: But it is unnece&s;&s;ary to dwell long on this article, as the be&s;t political wri|ters
<PB N="9" REF="021112_0008_0FB23B5C4579EAA0">
have &s;upported the principles of annual elections with a preci&s;ion that cannot be confuted, though they may be darkened by the &s;ophi&s;tical arguments that have been thrown out with de&s;ign, to undermine all the barriers of freedom.</P>
<P N="2">2. There is no &s;ecurity in the profered &s;y&s;tem, either for the rights of con&s;cience, or the liberty of the pre&s;s:&mdash; De&s;poti&s;m u&s;ually, while it is gaining ground; will &s;uffer men to think, &s;ay, or write what they plea&s;e; but when once e&s;tabli&s;hed, if it is thought nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ub&s;erve the purpo&s;es of arbitrary power, the mo&s;t unju&s;t re&s;trictions may take place in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, and an <HI>imprimator</HI> on the pre&s;s in the next, may &s;ilence the complaints, and for|bid the mo&s;t decent remon&s;trances of an injured and op|pre&s;&s;ed people.</P>
<P N="3">3. There are no well defined limits of the judiciary powers, they &s;eem to be left as a boundle&s;s ocean, that has broken over the chart of the &s;upreme lawgiver, "<HI>thus far &s;halt thou go and no farther,</HI>" and as they cannot be com|prehended by the cleare&s;t capacity, or the mo&s;t &s;agacious mind, it would be an Herculean labour to attempt to de|&s;cribe the dangers with which they are replete.</P>
<P N="4">4. The executive and the legi&s;lative are &s;o dangerou&s;ly blended as to give ju&s;t cau&s;e of alarm, and every thing re|lative thereto, is couched in &s;uch ambiguous terms&mdash;in &s;uch vague and indefinite expre&s;&s;ions, as is a &s;ufficient ground without any other objection, for the reprobation of a &s;y&s;tem, that the authors dare not hazard to a clear in|ve&s;tigation.</P>
<P N="5">5. The abolition of trial by jury in civil cau&s;es.&mdash;This mode of trial, the learned judge Black&s;tone ob&s;erves,
<Q>has been coeval with the fir&s;t rudiments of civil govern|ment, that property, liberty and life, depend on main|taining in its legal force the con&s;titutional trial by jury.</Q>
He bids his readers pau&s;e, and with Sir Matthew Hale ob&s;erves, how admirably this mode is adapted to the in|ve&s;tigation of truth beyond any other the world can pro|duce. Even the party who have been di&s;po&s;ed to &s;wallow without examination, the propo&s;als of the <HI>&s;ecret conclave,</HI> have &s;tarted on a di&s;covery that this e&s;&s;ential right was curtailed&punc; and &s;hall a privilege, the origin of which may be traced to our Saxon ance&s;tors&mdash;that has been a part of the law of nations, even in the &s;eudatory &s;y&s;tems of France, Germany, and Italy&mdash;and from the earlie&s;t records has
<PB N="10" REF="021112_0009_0FB23B5DC5577268">
been held &s;o &s;acred, both in ancient and modern Britain, that it could never be &s;haken by the introduction of Nor|man cu&s;toms, or any other conque&s;ts or chance of govern|ment &mdash;&s;hall this ine&s;timable privilege be relinqui&s;hed in America&mdash;either through the fear of inqui&s;ition for unac|counted thou&s;ands of public monies in the hands of &s;ome who have been officious in the fabrication of the <HI>con&s;olidat|ed &s;y&s;tem,</HI> or from the apprehen&s;ion that &s;ome future delin|quent, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of more power than integrity, may be cal|led to a trial by his peers in the hour of inve&s;tigation?</P>
<P N="6">6. Though it has been &s;aid by Mr. <HI>Wil&s;on,</HI> and many others, that a &s;tanding army is nece&s;&s;ary for the dignity and &s;afety of America, yet freedom revolts at the idea, when the Divan, or the de&s;pot, may draw out his dragoons to &s;uppre&s;s the murmurs of a few, who may yet cheri&s;h tho&s;e &s;ublime principles which call forth the exertions, and lead to the be&s;t improvment of the human mind. It is hoped this country may yet be governed by milder methods than are u&s;ually di&s;played beneath the bannerets of military law. Standing armies have been the nur&s;ery of vice, and the bane of liberty, from the Roman legions, to the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of the artful Ximenes, and from the ruin of the Cor|tes of Spain, to the planting the Briti&s;h Cohorts in the ca|pitals of America.&mdash;By the edicts of authority ve&s;ted in the &s;overeign power by the propo&s;ed con&s;titution, the mi|litia of the country, the bulwark of defence, and the &s;ecu|rity of national liberty, is no longer under the controul of civil authority; but at the re&s;cript of the monarch, or the ari&s;tocracy, they may either be employed to extort the enormous &s;ums that will be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport the civil li&s;t&mdash;to maintain the regalia of power&mdash;and the &s;plendour of the mo&s;t u&s;ele&s;s part of the community, or they may be &s;ent into foreign countries for the fulfilment of treaties, &s;tipulated by the pre&s;ident and two thirds of the &s;enate.</P>
<P N="7">7. Notwith&s;tanding the delu&s;ory promi&s;e to guarantee a republican form of government to every &s;tate in the uni|on &mdash;if the mo&s;t di&s;cerning eye could di&s;cover any mean|ing at all in the engagement, there are no re&s;ources left for the &s;upport of internal government, or the liquidation of the debts of the &s;tate. Every &s;ource of revenue is in the monopoly of Congre&s;s, and if the &s;everal legi&s;latures in their enfeebled &s;tate, &s;hould again&s;t their own feelings be nece&s;&s;itated to attempt a dry tax for the payment of their debts, and the &s;upport of internal police, even this may

be required for the purpo&s;es of the general government.</P>
<P N="8">8. As the new Congre&s;s are impowered to determine their own &s;alaries, the requi&s;itions for this purpo&s;e may not be very moderate, and the drain for public monies will probably ri&s;e pa&s;t all calculation; and it is to be fear|ed, when America has con&s;olidated its de&s;poti&s;m, the world will witne&s;s the truth of the a&s;&s;ertion&mdash;
<Q>that the pomp of an ea&s;tern monarch may impo&s;e on the vulgar who may e&s;timate the force of a nation by the magnificence of its palaces; but the wi&s;e man judges differently, it is by that very magnificence he e&s;timates its weakne&s;s. He &s;ees nothing more in the mid&s;t of this impo&s;ing pomp, where the tyrant &s;ets enthroned, than a &s;umptuous and mournful decoration of the dead; the aparatus of a fa&s;|tuous funeral, in the centre of which is a cold and life|le&s;s lump of unanimated earth, a phantom of power rea|dy to di&s;appear before the enemy, by whom it is de|&s;pi&s;ed!</Q></P>
<P N="9">9.

<P>But it is needle&s;s to enumerate other in&s;tances, in which the propo&s;ed con&s;titution appears contradictory to the fir&s;t principles which ought to govern mankind; and it is equally &s;o to enquire into the motives that induced to &s;o bold a &s;tep as the annihilation of the independence and &s;o|vereignty of the thirteen di&s;tinct &s;tates.&mdash;They are but too obvious through the whole progre&s;s o the bu&s;ine&s;s, from the fir&s;t &s;hutting up the doors of the Federal Convention, and re&s;olving that no member &s;hould corre&s;pond with gen|tlemen in the different &s;tates on the &s;ubject under di&s;cu&s;&s;i|on; till the trivial propo&s;ition of recommending a few amendments was artfully u&s;hered into the convention of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. The que&s;tions that were then before that honourable a&s;&s;embly were profound and important, they were of &s;uch magnitude and extent, that the con&s;equences may run parallel with the exi&s;tence of the country; and to &s;ee them waved and ha&s;tily terminated by a mea&s;ure too ab&s;urd to require a &s;erious refutation, rai&s;es the hone&s;t in|dignation of every true lover of his country.

<P>We were then told by him, in all the &s;oft language of in&s;inuation, that no form of government of human con|&s;truction can be perfect&mdash;that we had nothing to fear&mdash; that we had no rea&s;on to complain&mdash;that we had only to acquie&s;ce in their illegal claims, and to &s;ubmit to the re|qui&s;itions of parliament, and doubtle&s;s the lenient hand of government would redre&s;s all grievances, and remove the oppre&s;&s;ions of the people:&mdash;Yet we &s;oon &s;aw armies of mercenaries encamped on our plains&mdash;our commerce ru|ined &mdash;our harbours blockaded&mdash;and our cities burnt.

<P>Pa&s;&s;ion, prejudice, and error are characteri&s;tics of hu|man nature; and as it cannot be accounted for on any principles of philo&s;ophy, religion, or good policy, to the&s;e &s;hades in the human character mu&s;t be attributed the mad zeal of &s;ome to precipitate to a blind adoption of the mea|&s;ures of the late federal convention, without giving oppor|tunity for better information to tho&s;e who are mi&s;led by influence or ignorance into erroneous opinions. Literary talents may be pro&s;tituted, and the powers of genius de|ba&s;ed to &s;ub&s;erve the purpo&s;es of ambition or avarice; but the feelings of the heart will dictate the language of truth, and the &s;implicity of her accents will proclaim the infamy of tho&s;e who betray the rights of the people, under the &s;pecious and popular pretence of <HI>ju&s;tice, con&s;olidation,</HI> and <HI>dignity.</HI></P>
<P>It is pre&s;umed the great body of the people unite in &s;en|timent with the writer of the&s;e ob&s;ervations, who mo&s;t de|voutly prays, that public credit may rear her declining head, and remunerative ju&s;tice pervade the land; nor is there a doubt, if a free government is continued, that time and indu&s;try will enable both the public and private debtor to liquidate their arrearages in the mo&s;t equitable manner.

It has been ob&s;erved, by a zealous advocate for the new &s;y&s;tem, that mo&s;t governments are the re&s;ult of fraud or violence, and this with a view to recommend its acceptance; but has not almo&s;t every &s;tep towards its fabrication been fraudu|lent in the extreme? Did not the prohibition, &s;trictly en|joined by the general Convention, that no member &s;hould make any communication to his con&s;tituents, or to gentle|men of con&s;ideration and abilities in the other States, bear evident marks of fraudulent de&s;igns? This circum&s;tance is regretted in &s;trong terms by Mr. Martin, a member from Maryland, who acknowledges
<Q>he had no idea that all the wi&s;dom, integrity, and virtue of the States was con|tained in that Convention, and that he wi&s;hed to have corre&s;ponded with gentlemen of eminent political cha|racters abroad, and give their &s;entiments due weight.</Q>
He adds,
<Q>&s;o extremely &s;olicitous were they, that their proceedings &s;hould not tran&s;pire, that the members were prohibited from taking copies of their re&s;olutions, or extracts from the journals, without expre&s;s permi&s;&s;ion, by vote.</Q>
And the hurry with which it has been urged to the acceptance of the people, without giving time, by adjournments, for better information and more unanimity, has a deceptive appearance; and if finally driven to re|&s;i&s;tance, as the only alternative between that and &s;ervi|tude, till in the confu&s;ion of di&s;cord, the reins &s;hould be &s;eized by the violence of &s;ome enterpri&s;ing genius, that may &s;weep down the la&s;t barrier of liberty, it mu&s;t be added to the &s;core of criminality with which the fraudu|lent u&s;urpation at Philadelphia may be chargeable.

Since her di&s;memberment from the Briti&s;h empire, Ame|rica has, in many in&s;tances, re&s;embled the conduct of a re&s;tle&s;s, vigorous, luxurious youth, prematurely emanci|pated from the authority of a parent, but without the ex|perience

nece&s;&s;ary to direct him to act with dignity or di&s;|cretion. Thus we have &s;een her break the &s;hackles of foreign dominion, and all the ble&s;&s;ings of peace re&s;tored on the mo&s;t honourable terms. She acquired the liberty of framing her own laws, choo&s;ing her own magi&s;trates, and adopting manners and modes of government the mo&s;t favourable to the freedom and happine&s;s of &s;ociety. But how little have we availed our&s;elves of the&s;e &s;uperior ad|vantages: The glorious fabric of liberty, &s;ucce&s;sfully rear|ed with &s;o much labour and a&s;&s;iduity, totters to the foun|dation, and may be blown away, as the bubble of fancy, by the rude breath of military combinations, and the po|liticians of ye&s;terday.</P>
<P>It is true this country lately armed in oppo&s;ition to re|gal de&s;poti&s;m&mdash;impoveri&s;hed by the expences of a long war, and unable immediately to fulfil their public or pri|vate engagements, have appeared in &s;ome in&s;tances with a boldne&s;s of &s;pirit that &s;eemed to &s;et at defiance all autho|rity, government, or order, on the one hand, while on the other, there has been not only a &s;ecret wi&s;h, but an open avowal of the nece&s;&s;ity of drawing the reins of govern|ment much too taught, not only for republicani&s;m, but for a wi&s;e and limited monarchy. But the character of this people is not aver&s;e to a degree of &s;ubordination: the truth of this appears from the ea&s;y re&s;toration of tranqui|lity, after a dangerous in&s;urrection in one of the &s;tates; this al&s;o evinces the little nece&s;&s;ity of a complete revolu|tion of government throughout the Union. But it is a republican principle, that the majority &s;hould rule; and if a &s;pirit of moderation could be cultivated on both &s;ides, till the voice of the people at large could be fairly heard, it &s;hould be held &s;acred: And if, on &s;uch a &s;crutiny, the propo&s;ed con&s;titution &s;hould appear repugnant to their character and wi&s;hes&mdash;if they, in the language of a late elegant pen, &s;hould acknowledge that
<Q>no confu&s;ion, in my mind, is more terrible to them, than the &s;tern di&s;ciplined regularity and vaunted police of arbitrary governments, where every heart is depraved by fear, where mankind dare not a&s;&s;ume their natural characters, where the free &s;pirit mu&s;t crouch to the &s;lave in office, where genius mu&s;t repre&s;s her effu&s;ions, or, like the Egyptian wor|&s;hippers, offer them in &s;acrifice to the calves in power, and where the human mind, always in &s;hackles, &s;hrinks from every generous effort.</Q>

the effrontery to &s;ay, it ought not to be thrown out with indignation, however &s;ome re&s;pectable names have ap|peared to &s;upport it. But if after all, on a di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate and fair di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, the people generally give their voice for a voluntary dereliction of their privileges, let every individual, who choo&s;es the active &s;cenes of life, &s;trive to &s;upport the peace and unanimity of his country, though every other ble&s;&s;ing may expire; and while the &s;tate&s;man is plodding for power, and the courtier practi&s;ing the arts of di&s;&s;imulation without check; while the rapacious are growing rich by oppre&s;&s;ion, and fortune throwing her gifts into the lap of fools, let the &s;ublimer characters, the philo&s;ophic lovers of freedom, who have wept over her exit, retire to the calm &s;hades of contemplation; there they may look down with pity on the incon&s;i&s;tency of human nature, the revolutions of &s;tates, the ri&s;e of king|doms, and the fall of empires.</P>
