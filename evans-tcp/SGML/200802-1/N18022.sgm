<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>MATTHEW VII. 12.</BIBL>
<P>THEREFORE ALL THINGS WHATSOEVER YOU WOULD, THAT MEN SHOULD DO TO YOU, DO YE EVEN SO TO THEM; FOR THIS IS THE LAW AND THE PROPHETS.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS precept of our divine Lord hath always been admired as mo&s;t excellent; and doubt|le&s;s with the greate&s;t rea&s;on. Yet it needs &s;ome explanation. It is not &s;urely to be under&s;tood in the mo&s;t unlimited &s;en&s;e, implying that becau&s;e a prince expects and wi&s;hes for obedience from his &s;ubjects, he is obliged to obey them: that becau&s;e parents wi&s;h their children to &s;ubmit to their go|vernment, therefore they are to &s;ubmit to the go|vernment of their children: or that becau&s;e &s;ome men wi&s;h that others would concur and a&s;&s;i&s;t them to the gratification of their unlawful de&s;ires, there|fore they al&s;o are to gratify the unlawful de&s;ires of others. But whatever we are con&s;cious, that we &s;hould, in an exchange of circum&s;tances, wi&s;h, and are per&s;uaded that we might rea&s;onably wi&s;h, that others would do to us; that we are bound to do to them. This is the general rule given us in the
<PB N="4" REF="023346_0005_0FBF22CBB3EA0618">
text; and a very exten&s;ive rule it is, reaching to the whole of our conduct: and is particularly u&s;eful to direct our conduct toward inferiours, and tho&s;e whom we have in our power. I have therefore thought it a proper foundation for the di&s;cour&s;e which by <HI>the Society for the Promotion of Freedom, and for the Relief of Per&s;ons unlawfully holden in Bondage,</HI> I have the honour to be appointed to de|liver, on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>This divine maxim is mo&s;t properly applicable to the &s;lave-trade, and to the &s;lavery of the Afri|cans. Let us then make the application.</P>
<P>Should we be willing, that the Africans or any other nation &s;hould purcha&s;e us, our wives and children, tran&s;port us into Africa and there &s;ell us into perpetual and ab&s;olute &s;lavery? Should we be willing, that they by large bribes and offers of a gainful traffic &s;hould entice our neighbours to kid|nap and &s;ell us to them, and that they &s;hould hold in perpetual and cruel bondage, not only our&s;elves, but our po&s;terity through all generations? Yet why is it not as right for them to treat us in this man|ner, as it is for us to treat them in the &s;ame man|ner? Their colour indeed is different from our's. But does this give us a right to en&s;lave them? The nations from Germany to Guinea have com|plexions of every &s;hade from the faire&s;t white, to a jetty black: and if a black complexion &s;ubject a nation or an individual to &s;lavery; where &s;hall &s;la|very begin? or where &s;hall it end?</P>
<P>I propo&s;e to mention a few rea&s;ons again&s;t the right of the &s;lave-trade&mdash;and then to con&s;ider the principal arguments, which I have ever heard urg|ed in favour of it.&mdash;What will be &s;aid again&s;t the &s;lave-trade will generally be equally applicable to &s;lavery it&s;elf; and if conclu&s;ive again&s;t the former, will be equally conclu&s;ive again&s;t the latter.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="023346_0006_0FBF22CE342BA2F8">As to the &s;lave-trade, I conceive it to be unju&s;t in it&s;elf&mdash;abominable on account of the cruel man|ner in which it is conducted&mdash;and totally wrong on account of the impolicy of it, or its de&s;tructive ten|dency to the moral and political intere&s;ts of any country.</P>
<P N="1">I. It is unju&s;t in it&s;elf.&mdash;It is unju&s;t in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e, and for the &s;ame rea&s;on, as it is, to &s;teal, to rob, or to murder. It is a principle, the truth of which hath in this country been generally, if not univer&s;ally acknowledged, ever &s;ince the commence|ment of the late war, <HI>that all men are born equally free.</HI> If this be true, the Africans are by nature equally entitled to freedom as we are; and therefore we have no more right to en&s;lave, or to afford aid to en&s;lave them, than they have to do the &s;ame to us. They have the &s;ame right to their freedom, which they have to their property or to their lives. There|fore to en&s;lave them is as really and in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e wrong, as to &s;teal from them, to rob or to murder them.</P>
<P>There are indeed ca&s;es in which men may ju&s;t|ly be deprived of their liberty and reduced to &s;lavery; as there are ca&s;es in which they may be ju&s;tly deprived of their lives. But they can ju&s;tly be deprived of neither, unle&s;s they have by their own voluntary conduct forfeited it. Therefore &s;till the right to liberty &s;tands on the &s;ame ba&s;is with the right to life. And that the Africans have done &s;omething whereby they have forfeited their liberty mu&s;t appear, before we can ju&s;tly deprive them of it; as it mu&s;t appear, that they have done &s;ome|thing whereby they have forfeited their lives, be|fore we may ju&s;tly deprive them of the&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">II. The &s;lave-trade is wicked and abominable on account of the cruel manner in which it is car|ried on.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="023346_0007_0FBF22CF71757408">Be&s;ide the &s;tealing or kidnapping of men, wo|men and children, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, and the in|&s;tigation of others to this abominable practice; the inhuman manner in which they are tran&s;ported to America, and in which they are treated on their pa&s;&s;age and in their &s;ub&s;equent &s;lavery, is &s;uch as ought forever to deter every man from acting any part in this bu&s;ine&s;s, who has any regard to ju&s;tice or humanity. They are crowded &s;o clo&s;ely into the holds and between the decks of ve&s;&s;els, that they have &s;carcely room to lie down, and &s;ometimes not room to &s;it up in an erect po&s;ture; the men at the &s;ame time fa&s;tened together with irons by two and two; and all this in the mo&s;t &s;ultry climate. The con&s;equence of the whole is, that the mo&s;t dan|gerous and fatal di&s;ea&s;es are &s;oon bred among them, whereby va&s;t numbers of tho&s;e exported from Afri|ca peri&s;h in the voyage: others in dread of that &s;lavery which is before them, and in di&s;tre&s;s and de&s;pair from the lo&s;s of their parents, their children, their hu&s;bands, their wives, all their dear connec|tions, and their dear native country it&s;elf, &s;tarve them&s;elves to death or plunge them&s;elves into the ocean. Tho&s;e who attempt in the former of tho&s;e ways to e&s;cape from their per&s;ecutors, are tortured by live coals applied to their mouths. Tho&s;e who attempt an e&s;cape in the latter and fail, are equally tortured by the mo&s;t cruel beating, or otherwi&s;e as their per&s;ecutors plea&s;e. If any of them make an attempt, as they &s;ometimes do, to recover their li|berty, &s;ome, and as the circum&s;tances may be, ma|ny, are put to immediate death. Others beaten, brui&s;ed, cut and mangled in a mo&s;t inhuman and &s;hocking manner, are in this &s;ituation exhibited to the re&s;t, to terrify them from the like attempt in future: and &s;ome are delivered up to every &s;pecies of torment, whether by the application of the whip,
<PB N="7" REF="023346_0008_0FBF22D233C75F00">
or of any other in&s;trument, even of fire it&s;elf, as the ingenuity of the &s;hip-ma&s;ter and of his crew is able to &s;ugge&s;t or their &s;ituation will admit; and the&s;e torments are purpo&s;ely continued for &s;everal days, before death is permitted to afford relief to the&s;e objects of vengeance.</P>
<P>By the&s;e means, according to the common com|putation, twenty-five thou&s;and, which is a fourth part of tho&s;e who are exported from Africa, and by the conce&s;&s;ion of all, twenty thou&s;and, annually per|i&s;h, before they arrive at the places of their de&s;ti|nation in America.</P>
<P>But this is by no means the end of the &s;ufferings of this unhappy people. Bred up in a country &s;pon|taneou&s;ly yielding the nece&s;&s;aries and conveniences of &s;avage life, they have never been accu&s;tomed to labour: of cour&s;e they are but ill prepared to go through the fatigue and drudgery to which they are doomed in their &s;tate of &s;lavery. Therefore partly by this cau&s;e, partly by the &s;cantine&s;s and badne&s;s of their food, and partly from dejection of &s;pirits, mortification and de&s;pair, another twenty-five thou|&s;and die in the &s;ea&s;oning, as it is called, i. e. with|in two years of their arrival in America. This I &s;ay is the common computation. Or if we will in this particular be as favourable to the trade as in the e&s;timate of the number which peri&s;hes on the pa&s;&s;age, we may reckon the number which dies in the &s;ea&s;oning to be twenty thou&s;and. So that of the hundred thou&s;and annually exported from Af|rica to America, fifty thou&s;and, as it is commonly computed, or on the mo&s;t favourable e&s;timate, forty thou&s;and, die before they are &s;ea&s;oned to the coun|try.</P>
<P>Nor is this all. The cruel &s;ufferings of the&s;e pi|tiable beings are not yet at an end. Thencefor|ward
<PB N="8" REF="023346_0009_0FBF22D911CE9418">
they have to drag out a mi&s;erable life in ab&s;o|lute &s;lavery, entirely at the di&s;po&s;al of their ma&s;ters, by whom not only every venial fault, every mere inadvertence or mi&s;take, but even real virtues, are liable to be con&s;trued into the mo&s;t atrocious crimes, and puni&s;hed as &s;uch, according to their caprice or rage, while they are intoxicated &s;ometimes with li|quor, &s;ometimes with pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>By the&s;e ma&s;ters they are &s;upplied with barely enough to keep them from &s;tarving, as the whole expence laid out on a &s;lave for food, clothing and medicine is commonly computed on an average at thirty &s;hillings &s;terling annually. At the &s;ame time they are kept at hard labour from five o'clock in the morning, till nine at night, excepting time to eat twice during the day. And they are con&s;tant|ly under the watchful eye of over&s;eers and Negro-drivers more tyrannical and cruel than even their ma&s;ters them&s;elves. From the&s;e drivers for every imagined, as well as real neglect or want of exerti|on, they receive the la&s;h, the &s;mack of which is all day long in the ears of tho&s;e who are on the plant|ation or in the vicinity; and it is u&s;ed with &s;uch dex|terity and &s;everity, as not only to lacerate the &s;kin, but to tear out &s;mall portions of the fle&s;h at almo&s;t every &s;troke.</P>
<P>This is the general treatment of the &s;laves. But many individuals &s;uffer &s;till more &s;everely. Many, many are knocked down; &s;ome have their eyes beaten out; &s;ome have an arm or a leg broken, or chopt off; and many for a very &s;mall or for no crime at all, have been beaten to death merely to gratify the fury of an enraged ma&s;ter or over&s;eer.</P>
<P>Nor ought we on this occa&s;ion to overlook the wars among the nations of Africa excited by the trade, or the de&s;truction attendant on tho&s;e wars. Not to mention the de&s;truction of property, the
<PB N="9" REF="023346_0010_0FBF22DCF9F84560">
burning of towns and villages, &amp;c. it hath been de|termined by rea&s;onable computation, that there are annually exported from Africa to the various parts of America, one hundred thou&s;and &s;laves, as was before ob&s;erved; that of the&s;e &s;ix thou&s;and are cap|tives of war; that in the wars in which the&s;e are taken, ten per&s;ons of the victors and vanqui&s;hed are killed, to one taken; that therefore the taking of the &s;ix thou&s;and captives is attended with the &s;laugh|ter of &s;ixty thou&s;and of their countrymen. Now does not ju&s;tice? does not humanity &s;hrink from the idea, that in order to procure one &s;lave to grat|ify our avarice, we &s;hould put to death ten human beings? Or that in order to increa&s;e our property, and that only in &s;ome &s;mall degree, we &s;hould carry on a trade, or even connive at it, to &s;upport which &s;ixty thou&s;and of our own &s;pecies are &s;lain in war?</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ixty thou&s;and, added to the forty thou|&s;and who peri&s;h on the pa&s;&s;age and in the &s;ea&s;on|ing, give us an hundred thou&s;and who are annually de&s;troyed by the trade; and the whole advantage gained by this amazing de&s;truction of human lives is &s;ixty thou&s;and &s;laves. For you will recollect, that the whole number exported from Africa is an hundred thou&s;and; that of the&s;e forty thou&s;and die on the pa&s;&s;age and in the &s;ea&s;oning, and &s;ixty thou|&s;and are de&s;troyed in the wars. Therefore while one hundred and &s;ixty thou&s;and are killed in the wars and are exported from Africa, but &s;ixty thou|&s;and are added to the &s;tock of &s;laves.</P>
<P>Now when we con&s;ider all this; when we con&s;i|der the mi&s;eries which this unhappy people &s;uffer in their wars, in their captivity, in their voyage to America, and during a wretched life of cruel &s;la|very: and e&s;pecially when we con&s;ider the annual de&s;truction of an hundred thou&s;and lives in the manner before mentioned; who can he&s;itate to de|clare
<PB N="10" REF="023346_0011_0FBF22DE8C3DDD88">
this trade and the con&s;equent &s;lavery to be contrary to every principle of ju&s;tice and humanity, of the law of nature and of the law of God?</P>
<P N="3">III. This trade and this &s;lavery are utterly wrong on the ground of impolicy. In a variety of re&s;pects they are exceedingly hurtful to the &s;tate which to|lerates them.</P>
<P N="1">1. They are hurtful, as they deprave the morals of the people.&mdash;The ince&s;&s;ant and inhuman cruel|ties practi&s;ed in the trade and in the &s;ub&s;equent &s;la|very nece&s;&s;arily tend to harden the human heart a|gain&s;t the tender feelings of humanity in the ma&s;ters of ve&s;&s;els, in the &s;ailors, in the factors, in the proprietors of the &s;laves, in their children, in the over&s;eers, in the &s;laves them&s;elves, and in all who habitually &s;ee tho&s;e cruelties. Now the eradication or even the dimi|nution of compa&s;&s;ion, tenderne&s;s and humanity, is certainly a great depravation of heart, and mu&s;t be followed with corre&s;pondent depravity of manners. And mea&s;ures which lead to &s;uch depravity of heart and manners, cannot but be extremely hurtful to the &s;tate, and con&s;equently are extremely impolitic.</P>
<P N="2">2. The trade is impolitic as it is &s;o de&s;tructive of the lives of &s;eamen. The ingenious Mr. Clark|&s;on hath in a very &s;atisfactory manner made it ap|pear, that in the &s;lave-trade alone Great-Britain lo&s;es annually about nineteen hundred &s;eamen; and that this lo&s;s is more than double to the lo&s;s annu|ally &s;u&s;tained by Great-Britain in all her other trade taken together. And doubtle&s;s we lo&s;e as many as Great-Britain in proportion to the number of &s;ea|men whom we employ in this trade.&mdash;Now can it be politic to carry on a trade which is &s;o de&s;tructive of that u&s;eful part of our citizens, our &s;eamen?</P>
<P N="3">3. African &s;lavery is exceedingly impolitic, as it di&s;courages indu&s;try. Nothing is more e&s;&s;ential to the political pro&s;perity of any &s;tate, than indu&s;try in
<PB N="11" REF="023346_0012_0FBF22E181A6C290">
the citizens. But in proportion as &s;laves are mul|tiplied, every kind of labour becomes ignominious: and in fact in tho&s;e of the United States, in which &s;laves are the mo&s;t numerous, gentlemen and ladies of any fa&s;hion di&s;dain to employ them&s;elves in bu|&s;ine&s;s, which in other &s;tates is con&s;i&s;tent with the dignity of the fir&s;t families and fir&s;t offices. In a country filled with Negro &s;laves, labour belongs to them only, and a white man is de&s;pi&s;ed in propor|tion as he applies to it.&mdash;Now how de&s;tructive to indu&s;try in all of the lowe&s;t and middle cla&s;s of ci|tizens, &s;uch a &s;ituation and the prevalence of &s;uch ideas will be, you can ea&s;ily conceive. The con|&s;equence is, that &s;ome will nearly &s;tarve, others will betake them&s;elves to the mo&s;t di&s;hone&s;t practices, to obtain the means of living.</P>
<P>As &s;lavery produces indolence in the white peo|ple, &s;o it produces all tho&s;e vices which are natu|rally connected with it; &s;uch as intemperance, lewdne&s;s and prodigality. The&s;e vices enfeeble both the body and the mind, and unfit men for any vigorous exertions and employments either ex|ternal or mental. And tho&s;e who are unfit for &s;uch exertions, are already a very degenerate race; de|generate, not only in a moral, but a natural &s;en&s;e. They are contemptible too, and will &s;oon be de|&s;pi&s;ed even by their Negroes them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Slavery tends to lewdne&s;s not only as it produces indolence, but as it affords abundant opportunity for that wickedne&s;s without either the danger and difficulty of an attack on the virtue of a woman of cha&s;tity, or the danger of a connection with one of ill fame. A planter with his hundred wenches a|bout him is in &s;ome re&s;pects at lea&s;t like the Sul|tan in his &s;eraglio, and we learn the too frequent influence and effect of &s;uch a &s;ituation, not only from common fame, but from the multitude of
<PB N="12" REF="023346_0013_0FBF22E30D82E0A8">
mulattoes in countries where &s;laves are very nu|merous.</P>
<P>Slavery has a mo&s;t direct tendency to haughti|ne&s;s al&s;o, and a domineering &s;pirit and conduct in the proprietors of the &s;laves, in their children, and in all who have the control of them. A man who has been bred up in domineering over Negroes, can &s;carcely avoid contracting &s;uch a habit of haughti|ne&s;s and domination, as will expre&s;s it&s;elf in his general treatment of mankind, whether in his pri|vate capacity, or in any office civil or military with which he may be ve&s;ted. De&s;poti&s;m in economics naturally leads to de&s;poti&s;m in politics, and dome&s;tic &s;lavery in a free government is a perfect &s;oleci&s;m in human affairs.</P>
<P>How baneful all the&s;e tendencies and effects of &s;lavery mu&s;t be to the public good, and e&s;pecially to the public good of &s;uch a free country as our's, I need not inform you.</P>
<P N="4">4. In the &s;ame proportion as indu&s;try and labour are di&s;couraged, is population di&s;couraged and pre|vented. This is another re&s;pect in which &s;lavery is exceedingly impolitic. That population is pre|vented in proportion as indu&s;try is di&s;couraged, is, I conceive, &s;o plain that nothing needs to be &s;aid to illu&s;trate it. Mankind in general will enter into matrimony as &s;oon as they po&s;&s;e&s;s the means of &s;upporting a family. But the great body of any people have no other way of &s;upporting them|&s;elves or a family, than by their own labour. Of cour&s;e as labour is di&s;couraged, matrimony is di&s;|couraged and population is prevented.&mdash;But the impolicy of whatever produces the&s;e effects will be acknowledged by all. The wealth, &s;trength and glory of a &s;tate depend on the number of its virtu|ous citizens: and a &s;tate without citizens is at lea&s;t as great an ab&s;urdity, as a king without &s;ubjects.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="13" REF="023346_0014_0FBF22E5AC9DD060">5. The impolicy of &s;lavery &s;till further appears from this, that it weakens the &s;tate, and in propor|tion to the degree in which it exi&s;ts, expo&s;es it to become an ea&s;y conque&s;t.&mdash;The increa&s;e of free ci|tizens is an increa&s;e of the &s;trength of the &s;tate. But not &s;o with regard to the increa&s;e of &s;laves. They not only add nothing to the &s;trength of the &s;tate, but actually dimini&s;h it in proportion to their num|ber. Every &s;lave is naturally an enemy to the &s;tate in which he is holden in &s;lavery, and wants nothing but an opportunity to a&s;&s;i&s;t in its overthrow. And an enemy within a &s;tate, is much more dangerous than one without it.</P>
<P>The&s;e ob&s;ervations concerning the prevention of population and weakening the &s;tate, are &s;upported by facts which have fallen within our own ob&s;erva|tion. That the &s;outhern &s;tates, in which &s;laves are &s;o numerous, are in no mea&s;ure &s;o populous, ac|cording to the extent of territory, as the northern, is a fact of univer&s;al notoriety: and that during the late war, the &s;outhern &s;tates found them&s;elves greatly weakened by their &s;laves, and therefore were &s;o ea&s;i|ly overrun by the Briti&s;h army, is equally noto|rious.</P>
<P>From the view we have now taken of this &s;ub|ject we &s;cruple not to infer, that to carry on the &s;lave-trade and to introduce &s;laves into our coun|try, is not only to be guilty of inju&s;tice, robbery and cruelty toward our fellow-men; but it is to injure our&s;elves and our country; and therefore it is altogether unju&s;tifiable, wicked and abominable.</P>
<P>Having thus con&s;idered the inju&s;tice and ruinous tendency of the &s;lave-trade, I proceed to attend to the principal arguments urged in favour of it.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is &s;aid, that the Africans are the po&s;terity of Ham, the &s;on of Noah; that Canaan one of Ham's &s;ons, was cur&s;ed by Noah to be a &s;ervant

of &s;ervants; that by Canaan we are to under&s;tand Ham's po&s;terity in general; that as his po&s;terity are devoted by God to &s;lavery, we have a right to en&s;lave them.&mdash;This is the argument: to which I an&s;wer:</P>
<P>It is indeed generally thought that Ham peopled Africa; but that the cur&s;e on Canaan extended to all the po&s;terity of Ham is a mere imagination. The only rea&s;on given for it is, that Canaan was only one of Ham's &s;ons; and that it &s;eems rea&s;on|able, that the cur&s;e of Ham's conduct &s;hould fall on all his po&s;terity, if on any. But this argument is in&s;ufficient. We might as clearly argue, that the judgments denounced on the hou&s;e of David, on account of his &s;in in the matter of Uriah, mu&s;t equal|ly fall on all his po&s;terity. Yet we know, that many of them lived and died in great pro&s;perity. So in every ca&s;e in which judgments are predicted con|cerning any nation or family.</P>
<P>It is allowed in this argument, that the cur&s;e was to fall on the <HI>po&s;terity</HI> of Ham, and not immediate|ly on Ham him&s;elf; If otherwi&s;e, it is nothing to the purpo&s;e of the &s;lave-trade, or of any &s;laves now in exi&s;tence. It being allowed then, that this cur&s;e was to fall on Ham's po&s;terity, he who had a right to cur&s;e the whole of that po&s;terity, had the &s;ame right to cur&s;e a part of it only, and the po&s;terity of Canaan equally as any other <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">art; and a cur&s;e on Ham's po&s;terity in the line of Canaan was as real a cur&s;e on Ham him&s;elf, as a cur&s;e on all his po&s;teri|ty would have been.</P>
<P>Therefore we have no ground to believe, that this cur&s;e re&s;pected any others, than the po&s;terity of Canaan, who lived in the land of Canaan, which is well known to be remote from Africa. We have a particular account, that all the &s;ons of Canaan &s;ettled in the land of Canaan; as may be &s;een in

Gen. x. 15&mdash;20. <Q>And Canaan begat Sidon his fir&s;t born, and Heth, and the Jebu&s;ite, and the Emorite, and the Girga&s;ite, and the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite, and the Arvadite, and the Zemorite, and the Hamathite; and af|terward were the families of the Canaanites &s;pread abroad. And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou goe&s;t to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goe&s;t unto Sodom and Gomorrah, Ad|mah, and Zeboim, even unto La&s;hah.</Q>&mdash;Nor have we account that any of their po&s;terity except the Carthaginians afterward removed to any part of Africa: and none will pretend that the&s;e peopled Africa in general; e&s;pecially con&s;idering, that they were &s;ubdued, de&s;troyed and &s;o far extir|pated by the Romans.</P>
<P>This cur&s;e then of the po&s;terity of Canaan, had no reference to the inhabitants of Guinea, or of Af|rica in general; but was fulfilled partly in Jo&s;hua's time, in the reduction and &s;ervitude of the Canaan|ites, and e&s;pecially of the Gibeonites; partly by what the Phenicians &s;uffered from the Chaldeans, Per&s;ians and Greeks; and finally by what the Car|thaginians &s;uffered from the Romans.</P>
<P>Therefore this cur&s;e gives us no right to en&s;lave the Africans, as we do by the &s;lave-trade, becau&s;e it has no re&s;pect to the Africans whom we en&s;lave. Nor if it had re&s;pected them, would it have given any &s;uch right; becau&s;e it was not an in&s;titution of &s;lavery, but a mere prophecy of it. And from this prophecy we have no more ground to infer the right of &s;lavery, than we have from the prophecy of the de&s;truction of Jeru&s;alem by Nebuchadnezzar, or by the Romans, to infer their right re&s;pectively to de|&s;troy it in the manner they did&punc; or from other pro|phecies to infer the right of Judas to betray his ma&s;ter, or of the Jews to crucify him.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="16" REF="023346_0017_0FBF22E9B67C7898">2. The right of &s;lavery is inferred from the in|&s;tance of Abraham, who had &s;ervants born in his hou&s;e and bought with his money.&mdash;But it is by no means certain, that the&s;e were &s;laves, as our Ne|groes are. If they were, it is unaccountable, that he went out at the head of an army of them to fight his enemies. No We&s;t-India planter would ea&s;ily be induced to venture him&s;elf in &s;uch a &s;ituation. It is far more probable, that &s;imilar to &s;ome of the va&s;&s;als under the feudal con&s;titution, the &s;ervants of Abraham were only in a good mea&s;ure dependant on him, and protected by him. But if they were to all intents and purpo&s;es &s;laves, Abraham's holding of them will no more prove the right of &s;lavery, than his going in to Hagar, will prove it right for any man to cohabit with his wench.</P>
<P N="3">3. From the divine permi&s;&s;ion given the I&s;raelites to buy &s;ervants of the nations round about them, it is argued, that we have a right to buy the Africans and hold them in &s;lavery. See Lev. xxv. 44&mdash;47. <Q>Both thy bondmen and thy bondmaids, which thou &s;halt have, &s;hall be of the heathen that are round about you; of them &s;hall be buy bond|men and bondmaids. Moreover, of the child|ren of the &s;trangers that do &s;ojourn among you, of them &s;hall ye buy, and of their families, that are with you, which they begat in your land; and they &s;hall be your po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. And ye &s;hall take them as an inheritance for your children af|ter you, to inherit them for a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; they &s;hall be your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of I&s;rael ye &s;hall not rule one over another with rigour.</Q> But if this be at all to the purpo&s;e, it is a permi&s;&s;ion to every nation under heaven to buy &s;laves of the nations round a|bout them: to us, to buy of our Indian neigh|bours; to them, to buy of us; to the French, to
<PB N="17" REF="023346_0018_0FBF22EB31EBE458">
buy of the Engli&s;h, and to the Engli&s;h to buy of the French; and &s;o through the world. If then this argument be valid, every man has an entire right to engage in this trade, and to buy and &s;ell any other man of another nation, and any other man of another nation has an entire right to buy and &s;ell him. Thus according to this con&s;truction, we have in Lev. xxv. 43, &amp;c. an in&s;titution of an univer&s;al &s;lave-trade, by which every man may not only become a merchant, but may rightfully be|come the merchandize it&s;elf of this trade, and may be bought and &s;old like a bea&s;t.&mdash;Now this con&s;e|quence will be given up as ab&s;urd, and therefore al&s;o the con&s;truction of &s;cripture from which it fol|lows, mu&s;t be given up. Yet it is pre&s;umed, that there is no avoiding that con&s;truction or the ab&s;urd|ity flowing from it, but by admitting, that this per|mi&s;&s;ion to the I&s;raelites to buy &s;laves has no re&s;pect to us, but was in the &s;ame manner peculiar to them, as the permi&s;&s;ion and command to &s;ubdue, de&s;troy and extirpate the whole Canaaniti&s;h nation; and therefore no more gives countenance to African &s;lavery, than the command to extirpate the Cana|anites, gives countenance to the extirpation of any nation in the&s;e days, by an univer&s;al &s;laughter of men and women, young men and maidens, infants and &s;ucklings.</P>
<P N="4">4. It is further pleaded, that there were &s;laves in the time of the apo&s;tles; that they did not forbid the holding of tho&s;e &s;laves, but gave directions to &s;ervants, doubtle&s;s referring to the &s;ervants of that day, to obey <HI>their ma&s;ters,</HI> and <HI>count them worthy of all honour.</HI></P>
<P>To this the an&s;wer is, that the apo&s;tles teach the general duties of &s;ervants who are righteou&s;ly in the &s;tate of &s;ervitude, as many are or may be, by hire, by indenture, and by judgment of a civil court.
<PB N="18" REF="023346_0019_0FBF22F793470B18">
But they do not &s;ay, whether the &s;ervants in general of that day were ju&s;tly holden in &s;lavery or not. In like manner they lay down the general rules of obedience to civil magi&s;trates, without deciding concerning the characters of the magi&s;trates of the Roman empire in the reign of Nero. And as the apo&s;tle Paul requires ma&s;ters <HI>to give their &s;ervants that which is ju&s;t and equal,</HI> (Col. iv. 1.) &s;o if any were en&s;laved unju&s;tly, of cour&s;e he in this text re|quires of the ma&s;ters of &s;uch, to give them their freedom.&mdash;Thus the apo&s;tles treat the &s;lavery of that day in the &s;ame manner that they treat the civil government; and &s;ay nothing more in favour of the former, than they &s;ay in favour of the latter.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, this argument from the &s;lavery prevail|ing in the days of the apo&s;tles, if it prove any thing, proves too much, and &s;o confutes it&s;elf. It proves, that we may en&s;lave all captives taken in war, of any nation, and in any the mo&s;t unju&s;t war, &s;uch as the wars of the Romans, which were generally un|dertaken from the motives of ambition or avarice. On the ground of this argument we had a right to en&s;lave the pri&s;oners, whom we, during the late war, took from the Briti&s;h army; and they had the &s;ame right to en&s;lave tho&s;e whom they took from us; and &s;o with re&s;pect to all other nations.</P>
<P N="5">5. It is &s;trongly urged, that the Negroes brought from Africa are all captives of war, and therefore are ju&s;tly bought and holden in &s;lavery.&mdash;This is a principal argument always urged by the advocates for &s;lavery; and in a &s;olemn debate on this &s;ubject, it hath been &s;trongly in&s;i&s;ted on, very lately in the Briti&s;h parliament. Therefore it requires our par|ticular attention.</P>
<P>Captives in a war ju&s;t on their part, cannot be ju&s;tly en&s;laved; nor is this pretended. Therefore the captives who may be ju&s;tly en&s;laved, mu&s;t be
<PB N="19" REF="023346_0020_0FBF22FC13F9EFF8">
taken in a war unju&s;t on their part. But even on the &s;uppo&s;ition, that captives in &s;uch a war may be ju&s;tly en&s;laved, it will not follow, that we can ju&s;t|ly carry on the &s;lave-trade, as it is commonly car|ried on from the African coa&s;t. In this trade any &s;laves are purcha&s;ed, who are offered for &s;ale, whe|ther ju&s;tly or unju&s;tly en&s;laved. No enquiry is made whether they were captives in any war; much le&s;s, whether they were captivated in a war unju&s;t on their part.</P>
<P>By the mo&s;t authentic accounts, it appears, that the wars in general in Africa are excited by the pro&s;pect of gain from the &s;ale of the captives of the war. Therefore tho&s;e taken by the a&s;&s;ailants in &s;uch wars, cannot be ju&s;tly en&s;laved. Be&s;ide the&s;e, many are kidnapped by tho&s;e of neighbouring na|tions; &s;ome by their own neighbours; and &s;ome by their kings or his agents; others for debt or &s;ome trifling crime are condemned to perpetual &s;lavery&mdash;But none of the&s;e are ju&s;tly en&s;laved. And the traders make no enquiry concerning the mode or occa&s;ion of their fir&s;t en&s;lavement. They buy all that are offered, provided they like them and the price.&mdash;So that the plea, that the African &s;laves are captives in war, is entirely in&s;ufficient to ju&s;tify the &s;lave-trade as now carried on.</P>
<P>But this is not all; if it were ever &s;o true, that all the Negroes exported from Africa were captives in war, and that they were taken in a war unju&s;t on their part; &s;till they could not be ju&s;tly en&s;laved. &mdash;We have no right to en&s;lave a private foe in a &s;tate of nature, after he is conquered. Suppo&s;e in a &s;tate of nature one man ri&s;es again&s;t another and endeavours to kill him; in this ca&s;e the per&s;on a&s;|&s;aulted has no right to kill the a&s;&s;ailant, unle&s;s it be nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve his own life. But in wars be|tween nations, one nation may no doubt &s;ecure it|&s;elf
<PB N="20" REF="023346_0021_0FBF22FD4FAA0668">
again&s;t another, by other means than the &s;lave|ry of its captives. If a nation be victorious in the war, it may exact &s;ome towns or a di&s;trict of coun|try, by way of caution; or it may impo&s;e a fine to deter from future injuries. If the nation be not victorious, it will do no good to en&s;lave the captives whom it has taken. It will provoke the victors, and fooli&s;hly excite vengeance which cannot be re|pelled.</P>
<P>Or if neither nation be decidedly victorious, to en&s;lave the captives on either &s;ide can an&s;wer no good purpo&s;e, but mu&s;t at lea&s;t occa&s;ion the en&s;lav|ing of the citizens of the other nation, who are now, or in future may be in a &s;tate of captivity. Such a practice therefore nece&s;&s;arily tends to evil and not good.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides; captives in war are generally common &s;oldiers or common citizens; and they are general|ly ignorant of the true cau&s;e or cau&s;es of the war, and are by their &s;uperiours made to believe, that the war is entirely ju&s;t on their part. Or if this be not the ca&s;e, they may by force be compelled to &s;erve in a war which they know to be unju&s;t. In either of the&s;e ca&s;es they do not de&s;erve to be con|demned to perpetual &s;lavery. To inflict perpetual &s;lavery on the&s;e private &s;oldiers and citizens is man|ife&s;tly not to do, as we would wi&s;h that men &s;hould do to us. If we were taken in a war unju&s;t on our part, we &s;hould not think it right to be condemned to perpetual &s;lavery. No more right is it for us to condemn and hold in perpetual &s;lavery others, who are in the &s;ame &s;ituation.</P>
<P N="6">6. It is argued, that as the Africans in their own country, previou&s;ly to the purcha&s;e of them by the African traders, are captives in war; if they were not bought up by tho&s;e traders, they would be put to death: that therefore to purcha&s;e them and to
<PB N="21" REF="023346_0022_0FBF22FEB90C0100">
&s;ubject them to &s;lavery in&s;tead of death, is an act of mercy not only lawful, but meritorious.</P>
<P>If the ca&s;e were indeed &s;o as is now repre|&s;ented, the purcha&s;e of the Negroes would be no more meritorious, than the act of a man, who, if we were taken by the Algerines, &s;hould purcha&s;e us out of that &s;lavery. This would indeed be an act of benevolence, if the purcha&s;er &s;hould &s;et us at li|berty. But it is no act of benevolence to buy a man out of one &s;tate into another no better. Nay, the act of ran&s;oming a man from death gives no right to the ran&s;omer to commit a crime or an act of inju&s;tice to the per&s;on ran&s;omed. The per&s;on ran&s;omed is doubtle&s;s obligated according to his ability to &s;atisfy the ran&s;omer for his expence and trouble. Yet the ran&s;omer has no more right to en&s;lave the other, than the man who &s;aves the life of another who was about to be killed by a robber or an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, has a right to en&s;lave him.&mdash;The li|berty of a man for life is a far greater good, than the property paid for a Negro on the African coa&s;t. And to deprive a man of an immen&s;ely greater good, in order to recover one immen&s;ely le&s;s, is an immen&s;e injury and crime.</P>
<P N="7">7. As to the pretence, that to prohibit or lay a|&s;ide this trade, would be hurtful to our commerce; it is &s;ufficient to a&s;k, whether on the &s;uppo&s;ition, that it were advantageous to the commerce of Great-Britain to &s;end her &s;hips to the&s;e &s;tates, and tran&s;|port us into perpetual &s;lavery in the We&s;t-Indies, it would be right that &s;he &s;hould go into that trade.</P>
<P N="8">8. That to prohibit the &s;lave trade would in|fringe on the property of tho&s;e, who have expended large &s;ums to carry on that trade, or of tho&s;e who wi&s;h to purcha&s;e the &s;laves for their plantations, hath al&s;o been urged as an argument in favour of the trade.&mdash;But the &s;ame argument would prove,
<PB N="22" REF="023346_0023_0FBF230045BB8B68">
that if the &s;kins and teeth of the Negroes were as valuable articles of commerce as furs and elephant's teeth, and a merchant were to lay out his property in this commerce, he ought by no means to be ob|&s;tructed therein.</P>
<P N="9">9. But others will carry on the trade, if we do not.&mdash;So others will rob, &s;teal and murder, if we do not.</P>
<P N="10">10. It is &s;aid, that &s;ome men are intended by na|ture to be &s;laves.&mdash;If this mean, that the author of nature has given &s;ome men a licence, to en&s;lave o|thers; this is denied and proof is demanded. If it mean, that God hath made &s;ome of capacities in|ferior to others, and that the la&s;t have a right to en|&s;lave the fir&s;t; this argument will prove, that &s;ome of the citizens of every country, have a right to en|&s;lave other citizens of the &s;ame country; nay, that &s;ome have a right to en&s;lave their own brothers and &s;i&s;ters.&mdash;But if this argument mean, that God in his providence &s;uffers &s;ome men to be en&s;laved, and that this proves, that from the beginning he intend|ed they &s;hould be en&s;laved, and made them with this intention; the an&s;wer is, that in like manner he &s;uffers &s;ome men to be murdered, and in this &s;en&s;e, he intended and made them to be murdered. Yet no man in his &s;en&s;es will hence argue the law|fulne&s;s of murder.</P>
<P N="11">11. It is further pretended, that no other men, than Negroes, can endure labour in the hot cli|mates of the We&s;t-Indies and the &s;outhern &s;tates.&mdash; But does this appear to be fact? In all other cli|mates, the labouring people are the mo&s;t healthy. And I confe&s;s I have not yet &s;een evidence, but that tho&s;e who have been accu&s;tomed to labour and are inured to tho&s;e climates, can bear labour there al&s;o.&mdash;However, taking for granted the fact a&s;&s;erted in this objection, does it follow, that the
<PB N="23" REF="023346_0024_0FBF2301CBC33330">
inhabitants of tho&s;e countries have a right to en&s;lave the Africans to labour for them? No more &s;urely than from the circum&s;tance, that you are feeble and cannot labour, it follows, that you have a right to en&s;lave your robu&s;t neighbour. As in all other ca|&s;es, the feeble and tho&s;e who choo&s;e not to labour, and yet wi&s;h to have their lands cultivated, are ne|ce&s;&s;itated to hire the robu&s;t to labour for them; &s;o no rea&s;on can be given, why the inhabitants of hot climates &s;hould not either perform their own labour, or hire tho&s;e who can perform it, whether Negroes or others.</P>
<P>If our traders went to the coa&s;t of Africa to mur|der the inhabitants, or to rob them of their proper|ty, all would own that &s;uch murderous or piratical practices are wicked and abominable. Now it is as really wicked to rob a man of his liberty, as to rob him of his life; and it is much more wicked, than to rob him of his property. All men agree to con|demn highway robbery. And the &s;lave-trade is as much a greater wickedne&s;s than highway robbery, as liberty is more valuable than property. How &s;trange is it then, that in the &s;ame nation highway robbery &s;hould be puni&s;hed with death, and the &s;lave-trade be encouraged by national authority.</P>
<P>We all dread political &s;lavery, or &s;ubjection to the arbitrary power of a king or of any man or men not deriving their authority from the people. Yet &s;uch a &s;tate is inconceivably preferable to the &s;lave|ry of the Negroes. Suppo&s;e that in the late war we had been &s;ubdued by Great-Britain; we &s;hould have been taxed without our con&s;ent. But the&s;e taxes would have amounted to but a &s;mall part of our property. Whereas the Negroes are deprived of all their property; no part of their earnings is their own; the whole is their ma&s;ters.&mdash;In a conquered &s;tate we &s;hould have been at liberty to di&s;po&s;e of our|&s;elves
<PB N="24" REF="023346_0025_0FBF2304B4A8E948">
and of our property in mo&s;t ca&s;es, as we &s;hould choo&s;e. We &s;hould have been free to live in this or that town or place; in any part of the country, or to remove out of the country; to apply to this or that bu&s;ine&s;s; to labour or not; and excepting a &s;ufficiency for the taxes, to di&s;po&s;e of the fruit of our labour to our own benefit, or that of our child|ren, or of any other per&s;on. But the unhappy Ne|groes in &s;lavery can do none of the&s;e things. They mu&s;t do what they are commanded and as much as they are commanded, on pain of the la&s;h. They mu&s;t live where they are placed, and mu&s;t confine them&s;elves to that &s;pot, on pain of death.</P>
<P>So that Great-Britain in her late attempt to en|&s;lave America, committed a very &s;mall crime in|deed in compari&s;on with the crime of tho&s;e who en|&s;lave the Africans.</P>
<P>The arguments which have been urged again&s;t the &s;lave-trade, are with little variation applicable to the holding of &s;laves. He who holds a &s;lave, continues to deprive him of that liberty, which was taken from him on the coa&s;t of Africa. And if it were wrong to deprive him of it in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, why not in the &s;econd? If this be true, no man hath a better right to retain his Negro in &s;lavery, than he had to take him from his native African &s;hores. And every man who cannot &s;how, that his Negro hath by his voluntary conduct forfeit|ed his liberty, is obligated immediately to ma|numit him. Undoubtedly we &s;hould think &s;o, were we holden in the &s;ame &s;lavery in which the Negroes are: And our text requires us to do to o|thers, as we would that they &s;hould do to us.</P>
<P>To hold a &s;lave, who has a right to his liberty, is not only a real crime, but a very great one. Ma|ny good chri&s;tians have wondered how Abra|ham, the father of the faithful, could take Hagar to
<PB N="25" REF="023346_0026_0FBF22EDEBF0DEF0">
his bed; and how Sarah, celebrated as an holy woman, could con&s;ent to this tran&s;action: Al&s;o, how David and Solomon could have &s;o many wives and concubines, and yet be real &s;aints. Let &s;uch inquire how it is po&s;&s;ible, that our fathers and men now alive, univer&s;ally reputed pious, &s;hould hold Negro &s;laves, and yet be the &s;ubjects of real piety? And whether to reduce a man, who hath the &s;ame right to liberty as any other man, to a &s;tate of ab&s;olute &s;lavery, or to hold him in that &s;tate, be not as great a crime as concubinage or fornication. I pre&s;ume it will not be denied, that to commit theft or robbery every day of a man's life, is as great a &s;in as to commit fornication in one in&s;tance. But to &s;teal a man or to rob him of his liberty is a greater &s;in, than to &s;teal his property, or to take it by violence. And to hold a man in a &s;tate of &s;lavery, who has a right to his liberty, is to be every day guilty of robbing him of his liberty, or of man-&s;tealing. The con&s;equence is inevitable, that other things being the &s;ame, to hold a Negro &s;lave, un|le&s;s he have forfeited his liberty, is a greater &s;in in the &s;ight of God, than concubinage or fornication.</P>
<P>Does this conclu&s;ion &s;eem &s;trange to any of you? Let me entreat you to weigh it candidly before you reject it. You will not deny, that liberty is more valuable than property; and that it is a greater &s;in to deprive a man of his whole liberty during life, than to deprive him of his whole property; or that man-&s;tealing is a greater crime than robbery. Nor will you deny, that to hold in &s;lavery a man who was &s;tolen, is &s;ub&s;tantially the &s;ame crime as to &s;teal him. The&s;e principles being undeniable, I leave it to your&s;elves to draw the plain and nece&s;&s;ary con|&s;equence. And if your con&s;ciences &s;hall, in &s;pite of all oppo&s;ition, tell you, that while you hold your Negroes in &s;lavery, you do wrong, exceedingly

wrong; that you do not, as you would that men &s;hould do to you; that you commit &s;in in the &s;ight of God; that you daily violate the plain rights of mankind, and that in a higher degree, than if you committed theft or robbery; let me be&s;eech you not to &s;tifle this conviction, but attend to it and act accordingly; le&s;t you add to your former guilt, that of &s;inning again&s;t the light of truth, and of your own con&s;ciences.</P>
<P>To convince your&s;elves, that your information being the &s;ame, to hold a Negro &s;lave is a greater &s;in than fornication, theft or robbery, you need on|ly bring the matter home to your&s;elves. I am wil|ling to appeal to your own con&s;ciences, whether you would not judge it to be a greater &s;in for a man to hold you or your child during life in &s;uch &s;lavery, as that of the Negroes, than for him to &s;pend one night in a brothel, or in one in&s;tance to &s;teal or rob. Let con&s;cience &s;peak, and I will &s;ub|mit to it's deci&s;ion.</P>
<P>This que&s;tion &s;eems to be clearly decided by re|velation. Exod. xxi. 16. <Q>He that &s;tealeth a man and &s;elleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he &s;hall &s;urely be put to death.</Q> Thus death is, by the divine expre&s;s declaration, the puni&s;hment due to the crime of man-&s;tealing. But death is not the puni&s;hment declared by God to be due to for|nication, theft or robbery in common ca&s;es. There|fore we have the divine authority to a&s;&s;ert, that man-&s;tealing is a greater crime than fornication, theft or robbery. Now to hold in &s;lavery a man who has a right to liberty, is &s;ub&s;tantially the &s;ame crime as to deprive him of his liberty. And to deprive of li|berty and reduce to &s;lavery, a man who has a right to liberty, is man-&s;tealing. For it is immaterial whether he be taken and reduced to &s;lavery clan-de&s;tinely or by open violence. Therefore if the
<PB N="27" REF="023346_0028_0FBF22F1300EB048">
Negroes have a right to liberty, to hold them in &s;lavery is man-&s;tealing, which we have &s;een is, by God him&s;elf, declared to be a greater crime than fornication, theft or robbery.</P>
<P>Perhaps, though this truth be clearly demon|&s;trable both from rea&s;on and revelation, you &s;carce|ly dare receive it, becau&s;e it &s;eems to bear hardly on the characters of our pious fathers, who held &s;laves. But they did it ignorantly and in unbelief of the truth; as Abraham, Jacob, David and So|lomon were ignorant, that polygamy or concubin|age was wrong. As to dome&s;tic &s;lavery our fathers lived in a <HI>time of ignorance which God winked at; but now he commandeth all men every where to re|pent</HI> of this wickedne&s;s, and <HI>to break off this &s;in by righteou&s;ne&s;s, and this iniquity by &s;hewing mercy to the poor, if it may be a lengthening out of their tranquil|ity.</HI> You therefore to whom the pre&s;ent blaze of light as to this &s;ubject has reached, cannot &s;in at &s;o cheap a rate as our fathers.</P>
<P>But methinks I hear &s;ome &s;ay, I have bought my Negro; I have paid a large &s;um for him; I cannot lo&s;e this &s;um, and therefore I cannot manumit him. &mdash;Alas! This is <HI>hitting the nail on the head.</HI> This brings into view the true cau&s;e which makes it &s;o difficult to convince men of what is right in this ca&s;e.&mdash;You recollect the &s;tory of Amaziah's hiring an hundred thou&s;and men of I&s;rael, for an hund|red talents, to a&s;&s;i&s;t him again&s;t the Edomites; and that when by the word of the Lord, he was forbidden to take tho&s;e hired men with him to the war, he cried out, <Q>But what &s;hall we do for the hundred talents, which I have given to the army of I&s;rael?</Q> In this ca&s;e, the an&s;wer of God was, <Q>The Lord is able to give thee much more than this.</Q>&mdash;To apply this to the &s;ubject before us, God is able to give thee much more than thou &s;halt lo&s;e by manumitting thy &s;lave.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="023346_0029_0FBF230635760900">You may plead, that you u&s;e your &s;lave well; you are not cruel to him, but feed and clothe him comfortably, &amp;c. Still every day you rob him of a mo&s;t valuable and important right. And a high|way man, who robs a man of his money in the mo&s;t ea&s;y and complai&s;ant manner, is &s;till a robber; and murder may be effected in a manner the lea&s;t cruel and tormenting; &s;till it is murder.</P>
<P>Having now taken that view of our &s;ubject, which was propo&s;ed, we may in reflection &s;ee abundant rea&s;on to acquie&s;ce in the in&s;titution of this &s;ociety. If the &s;lave-trade be unju&s;t, and as gro&s;s a violation of the rights of mankind, as would be, if the Afri|cans &s;hould tran&s;port us into perpetual &s;lavery in Africa; to unite our influence again&s;t it, is a duty which we owe to mankind, to our&s;elves and to God too. It is but doing as we would that men &s;hould do to us.&mdash;Nor is it enough that we have formed the &s;ociety; we mu&s;t do the duties of it. The fir&s;t of the&s;e is to put an end to the &s;lave-trade. The &s;econd is to relieve tho&s;e who, contrary to the laws of the country, are holden in bondage. Another is to defend tho&s;e in their remaining legal and natur|al rights, who are by law holden in bondage. An|other and not the lea&s;t important object of this &s;o|ciety, I conceive to be, to increa&s;e and di&s;per&s;e the light of truth with re&s;pect to the &s;ubject of African &s;lavery, and &s;o prepare the way for its total aboli|tion. For until men in general are convinced of the inju&s;tice of the trade and of the &s;lavery it&s;elf, comparatively little can be done to effect the mo&s;t important purpo&s;es of the in&s;titution.</P>
<P>It is not to be doubted, that the trade is even now carried on from this &s;tate. Ve&s;&s;els are from time to time fitted out for the coa&s;t of Africa, to tran&s;port the Negroes to the We&s;t-Indies and other parts. Nor will an end be put to this trade, with|out
<PB N="29" REF="023346_0030_0FBF23094FC80230">
vigilance and &s;trenuous exertion on the part of this &s;ociety, or other friends of humanity, nor with|out a patient enduring of the oppo&s;ition and odium of all who are concerned in it, of their friends and of all who are of the opinion that it is ju&s;tifiable. Among the&s;e we are doubtle&s;s to reckon &s;ome of large property and con&s;iderable influence. And if the laws and cu&s;toms of the country equally allow|ed of it, many, and perhaps as many as now plead for the right of the African &s;lave-trade, would plead for the right of kidnapping us, the citizens of the United States, and of &s;elling us into perpetual &s;lave|ry.&mdash;If then we dare not incur the di&s;plea&s;ure of &s;uch men, we may as well di&s;&s;olve the &s;ociety, and leave the &s;lave-trade to be carried on, and the Ne|groes to be kidnapped, and though free in this &s;tate, to be &s;old into perpetual &s;lavery in di&s;tant parts, at the plea&s;ure of any man, who wi&s;hes to make gain by &s;uch abominable practices.</P>
<P>Though we mu&s;t expect oppo&s;ition, yet if we be &s;teady and per&s;evering, we need not fear, that we &s;hall fail of &s;ucce&s;s. The advantages, which the cau&s;e has already gained, are many and great. Thirty years ago &s;carcely a man in this country thought either the &s;lave-trade or the &s;lavery of Ne|groes to be wrong. But now how many and able advocates in private life, in our legi&s;latures, in Con|gre&s;s, have appeared and have openly and irrefra|gably pleaded the rights of humanity in this as well as other in&s;tances? Nay, the great body of the peo|ple from New-Hamp&s;hire to Virginia inclu&s;ively, have obtained &s;uch light, that in all tho&s;e &s;tates the further importation of &s;laves is prohibited by law. And in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and New-Hamp&s;hire, &s;lave|ry is totally aboli&s;hed.</P>
<P>Nor is the light concerning this &s;ubject confined to America. It hath appeared with great clearne&s;s
<PB N="30" REF="023346_0031_0FBF2311A07CCD90">
in France, and produced remarkable effects in the National A&s;&s;embly. It hath al&s;o &s;hone in bright beams in Great-Britain. It fla&s;hes with &s;plendor in the writings of Clark&s;on and in the proceedings of &s;everal &s;ocieties formed to aboli&s;h the &s;lave-trade. Nor hath it been po&s;&s;ible to &s;hut it out of the Brit|i&s;h parliament. This light is &s;till increa&s;ing, and in time will effect a total revolution. And if we judge of the future by the pa&s;t, within fifty years from this time, it will be as &s;hameful for a man to hold a Negro &s;lave, as to be guilty of common robbery or theft. But it is our duty to remove the ob&s;ta|cles which intercept the rays of this light, that it may reach not only public bodies, but every indi|vidual. And when it &s;hall have obtained a gene|ral &s;pread, &s;hall have di&s;pelled all darkne&s;s, and &s;lavery &s;hall be no more; it will be an honour to be recorded in hi&s;tory, as a &s;ociety which was form|ed, and which exerted it&s;elf with vigour and fideli|ty, to bring about an event &s;o nece&s;&s;ary and condu|cive to the intere&s;ts of humanity and virtue, to the &s;upport of the rights and to the advancement of the happine&s;s of mankind.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>SOME objections to the doctrine of the preced|ing &s;ermon, have been mentioned to the author, &s;ince the delivery of it. Of the&s;e it may be proper to take &s;ome notice.</P>
<P N="1">1. The &s;laves are in a better &s;ituation than that in which they were in their own country; e&s;pecial|ly as they have opportunity to know the Chri&s;tian religion and to &s;ecure the &s;aving ble&s;&s;ings of it. Therefore it is not an injury, but a benefit to bring them into this country, even though their importa|tion be accompanied and followed with &s;lavery. It is al&s;o &s;aid, that the &s;ituation of many Negroes un|der their ma&s;ters is much better, than it would be, were they free in this country; that they are much better fed and clothed, and are much more happy; that therefore to hold them in &s;lavery is &s;o far from a crime, that it is a meritorious act.</P>
<P>With regard to the&s;e pleas, it is to be ob&s;erved, that every man hath a right to judge concerning his own happine&s;s, and to choo&s;e the means of ob|taining or promoting it; and to deprive him of this right is the very injury of which we complain; it is to en&s;lave him. Becau&s;e we judge, that the Ne|groes are more happy in this country, in a &s;tate of &s;lavery, than in the enjoyment of liberty in Africa, we have no more right to en&s;lave them and bring them into this country, than we have to en&s;lave any of our neighbours, who we judge would be more happy under our control, than they are at pre&s;ent under their own. Let us make the ca&s;e our own. Should we believe, that we were ju&s;tly treated, if the Africans &s;hould carry us into perpetual &s;lavery
<PB N="32" REF="023346_0033_0FBF2315316946D8">
in Africa, on the ground that they judged, that we &s;hould be more happy in that &s;tate, than in our pre|&s;ent &s;ituation?</P>
<P>As to the opportunity which the Negroes in this country are &s;aid to have, to become acquainted with Chri&s;tianity; this with re&s;pect to many is granted: But what follows from it? It would be ridiculous to pretend, that this is the motive on which they act who import them, or they who buy and hold them in &s;lavery. Or if this were the motive, it would not &s;anctify either the trade or the &s;lavery. We are not at liberty to do evil, that good may come; to commit a crime more aggravated than theft or robbery, that we may make a pro&s;elyte to Chri&s;tianity. Neither our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, nor any one of his apo&s;tles has taught us this mode of propagating the faith.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is &s;aid, that the doctrine of the preceding &s;ermon imputes that as a crime to individuals, which is owing to the &s;tate of &s;ociety. This is granted; and what follows? It is owing to the &s;tate of &s;oci|ety, that our neighbours, the Indians roa&s;t their captives: and does it hence follow, that &s;uch con|duct is not to be imputed to the individual agents as a crime? It is owing to the &s;tate of &s;ociety in Popi&s;h countries, that thou&s;ands wor&s;hip the bea&s;t and his image: and is that wor&s;hip therefore not to be imputed as a crime to tho&s;e, who render it? Read the Revelation of St. John. The &s;tate of &s;o|ciety is &s;uch, that drunkenne&s;s and adultery are ve|ry common in &s;ome countries; but will it follow, that tho&s;e vices are innocent in tho&s;e countries?</P>
<P N="3">3. If I be ever &s;o willing to manumit my &s;lave, I cannot do it without being holden to maintain him, when he &s;hall be &s;ick or &s;hall be old and de|crepit. Therefore I have a right to hold him as a &s;lave.&mdash;The &s;ame argument will prove, that you
<PB N="33" REF="023346_0034_0FBF231804A38000">
have a right to en&s;lave your children or your pa|rents; as you are equally holden to maintain them in &s;ickne&s;s and in decrepit old age.&mdash;The argument implies, that in order to &s;ecure the money, which you are afraid the laws of your country will &s;ome time or other oblige you to pay; it is right for you to rob a free man of his liberty or be guilty of man-&s;tealing. On the ground of this argument every town or pari&s;h obligated by law, to maintain its helple&s;s poor, has a right to &s;ell into perpetual &s;lave|ry all the people, who may probably or even po&s;&s;i|bly occa&s;ion a public expence.</P>
<P N="4">4. After all, it is not &s;afe to manumit the Ne|groes: they would cut our throats; they would en|danger the peace and government of the &s;tate. Or at lea&s;t they would be &s;o idle, that they would not provide them&s;elves with nece&s;&s;aries: of cour&s;e they mu&s;t live by thievery and plundering.</P>
<P>This objection requires a different an&s;wer, as it re&s;pects the northern, and as it re&s;pects the &s;outh|ern &s;tates. As it re&s;pects the northern, in which &s;laves are &s;o few, there is not the lea&s;t foundation to imagine, that they would combine or make in|&s;urrection again&s;t the government; or that they would attempt to murder their ma&s;ters. They are much more likely to kill their ma&s;ters, in order to obtain their liberty, or to revenge the abu&s;e they receive, while it is &s;till continued, than to do it af|ter the abu&s;e hath cea&s;ed, and they are re&s;tored to their liberty. In this ca&s;e, they would from a &s;en&s;e of gratitude, or at lea&s;t from a conviction of the ju&s;tice of their ma&s;ters, feel a &s;trong attachment, in&s;tead of a murderous di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>Nor is there the lea&s;t danger, but that by a pro|per vigilance of the &s;elect-men, and by a &s;trict ex|ecution of the laws now exi&s;ting, the Negroes might in a tolerable degree be kept from idlene&s;s and pil|fering.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="023346_0035_0FBF23190C7335C8">All this hath been verified by experiment. In Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, all the Negroes in the common|wealth were by their new con&s;titution liberated in a day: and none of the ill con&s;equences objected fol|lowed either to the commonwealth or to individuals.</P>
<P>With regard to the &s;outhern &s;tates, the ca&s;e is different. The Negroes in &s;ome parts of tho&s;e &s;tates are a great majority of the whole, and there|fore the evils objected would, in ca&s;e of a general manumi&s;&s;ion at once, be more likely to take place. But in the fir&s;t place there is no pro&s;pect, that the conviction of the truth exhibited in the preceding di&s;cour&s;e, will at once, take place in the minds of all the holders of &s;laves. The utmo&s;t that can be expected, is that it will take place gradually in one after another, and that of cour&s;e the &s;laves will be gradually manumitted. Therefore the evils of a general manumi&s;&s;ion at once, are dreaded without rea&s;on.</P>
<P>If in any &s;tate the &s;laves &s;hould be manumitted in con&s;iderable numbers at once, or &s;o that the num|ber of free Negroes &s;hould become large; various mea&s;ures might be concerted to prevent the evils feared. One I beg leave to propo&s;e: That over|&s;eers of the free Negroes be appointed from among them&s;elves, who &s;hall be empowered to in&s;pect the morals and management of the re&s;t, and report to proper authority, tho&s;e who are vicious, idle or in|capable of managing their own affairs, and that &s;uch authority di&s;po&s;e of them under proper ma&s;ters for a year or other term, as is done, perhaps in all the &s;tates, with regard to the poor white people in like manner vicious, idle or incapable of management. Such black over&s;eers would naturally be ambitious to di&s;charge the duties of their office; they would in many re&s;pects have much more influence than white men with their country men: and other Ne|groes
<PB N="35" REF="023346_0036_0FBF231A706F1028">
looking forward to the &s;ame honourable di&s;|tinction, would endeavour to de&s;erve it by their improvement and good conduct.</P>
<P>But after all, this whole objection, if it were ever &s;o entirely founded on truth; if the freed Negroes would probably ri&s;e again&s;t their ma&s;ters, or com|bine again&s;t government; re&s;ts on the &s;ame ground, as the apology of the robber, who murders the man whom he has robbed. Says the robber to him&s;elf, I have robbed this man, and now if I let him go he will kill me, or he will complain to authority and I &s;hall be apprehended and hung. I mu&s;t therefore kill him. There is no other way of &s;afety for me. &mdash;The coincidence between this rea&s;oning and that of the objection under con&s;ideration, mu&s;t be mani|fe&s;t to all. And if this rea&s;oning of the robber be inconclu&s;ive; if the robber have no right on that ground to kill the man whom he hath robbed; neither have the &s;lave-holders any more right to continue to hold their &s;laves. If the robber ought to &s;pare the life of the man robbed, take his own chance and e&s;teem him&s;elf happy, if he can e&s;cape ju&s;tice; &s;o the &s;lave-holders ought immediately to let their &s;laves go free, treat them with the utmo&s;t kindne&s;s, by &s;uch treatment endeavour to pacify them with re&s;pect to pa&s;t injuries, and e&s;teem them|&s;elves happy, if they can compromi&s;e the matter in this manner.</P>
<P>In all countries in which the &s;laves are a majority of the inhabitants, the ma&s;ters lie in a great mea&s;ure at the mercy of the &s;laves, and may mo&s;t rationally expect &s;ooner or later, to be cut off, or driven out by the &s;laves, or to be reduced to the &s;ame level and to be mingled with them into one common ma&s;s. This I think is by antient and modern e|vents demon&s;trated to be the natural and nece&s;&s;ary cour&s;e of human affairs. The hewers of wood and
<PB N="36" REF="023346_0037_0FBF231C0204A9A0">
drawers of water among the I&s;raelites, the Helots among the Lacedemonians, the &s;laves among the Romans, the villains and va&s;&s;als in mo&s;t of the king|doms of Europe under the feudal &s;y&s;tem, have long &s;ince mixed with the common ma&s;s of the people, and &s;hared the common privileges and honours of their re&s;pective countries. And in the French We&s;t-Indies the Mulattoes and free Negroes are already become &s;o numerous and powerful a body, as to be allowed by the National A&s;&s;embly to enjoy the common rights and honours of free men. The&s;e facts plainly &s;how, what the whites in the We&s;t-Indies and the Southern States are to expect con|cerning their po&s;terity, that it will infallibly be a mungrel breed, or el&s;e they mu&s;t quit the country to the Negroes whom they have hitherto holden in bondage.</P>
<P>Thus it &s;eems, that they will be nece&s;&s;itated by Providence to make in one way or another com|pen&s;ation to the Negroes for the injury which they have done them. In the fir&s;t ca&s;e, by taking them into affinity with them&s;elves, giving them their own &s;ons and daughters in marriage, and making them and their po&s;terity the heirs of all their pro|perty and all their honours, and by rai&s;ing their co|lour to a partial whitene&s;s, whereby a part at lea&s;t of that mark which brings on them &s;o much con|tempt, will be wiped off. In the other ca&s;e, by leaving to them all their real e&s;tates. It is mani|fe&s;t by the bare &s;tating of the two ca&s;es, that the compen&s;ation in the latter ca&s;e is by much the lea&s;t. In the former ca&s;e, the compen&s;ation will include all that is included in the latter and much more. If therefore our &s;outhern brethren and the inha|bitants of the We&s;t-Indies would balance their ac|counts with their Negro &s;laves, at the cheape&s;t po&s;|&s;ible rate, they will doubtle&s;s judge it prudent, to
<PB N="37" REF="023346_0038_0FBF231D7A24A4C0">
leave the country with all their hou&s;es, lands and improvements to their quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and domini|on; as otherwi&s;e Providence will compel them to much dearer &s;ettlement, and one attended with a circum&s;tance inconceivably more mortifying, than the lo&s;s of all their real e&s;tates, I mean the mix|ture of their blood with that of the Negroes into one common po&s;terity.</P>
<P>At lea&s;t it is to be hoped, that the&s;e con&s;iderati|ons will induce them to forbear any further import|ation of &s;laves, as the more numerous the &s;laves are, the more dangerous they will be, and the more deeply tinged will be the colour of their mulatto po&s;terity.</P>
<P>It is not to be doubted, but that the Negroes in the&s;e northern &s;tates al&s;o will, in time, mix with the common ma&s;s of the people. But we have this con&s;olation, that as they are &s;o &s;mall a proportion of the inhabitants, when mixed with the re&s;t, they will not produce any very &s;en&s;ible diver&s;ity of co|lour.</P>
