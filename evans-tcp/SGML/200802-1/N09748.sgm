<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE painful circum&s;tances in which numbers are involved, when aged, or deprived of that, or tho&s;e, on whom their &s;upport chiefly depended, are too no|torious to require a recital. But that &s;ame Divine Wi&s;dom, which allows and orders the exi&s;tence of the&s;e calamities, has mercifully, and in proof of his providence, &s;o directed its manner, as to admit of their being greatly alleviated, by the joint endeavours of mankind. Ca&s;ualties, decays and death cannot be prevented, and &s;eparately con&s;idered appear to be un|der no particular regulation; and yet, when viewed collectively, are in a certain proportion, as has been confirmed by long and repeated ob&s;ervation; &s;o that many, by co-operating with each other, may &s;ecure individuals from tho&s;e hard&s;hips they mu&s;t otherwi&s;e experience; and that, on terms with which a rea&s;on|able and humane per&s;on will readily comply, for the relief it mu&s;t afford him to recollect, that he and his family are thereby in&s;ured, tho' in the other way they &s;hould never be benefited. An attention to the&s;e par|ticulars has given ri&s;e to various Societies in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> which within a few years have multiplied a|pace, chiefly in <HI>London.</HI> Though &s;uch Societies have been formed with a good de&s;ign, yet having in gene|ral gone upon mi&s;taken principles, they mu&s;t at length, if not &s;peedily regulated, be productive of much di&s;|appointment and calamity.</P>
<P>A benevolent de&s;ire of informing the public what calculations might be depended upon, and of averting that di&s;tre&s;s which was otherwi&s;e to be expected, has induced the Rev. Dr. <HI>Price,</HI> an eminent Mathematici|an, to publi&s;h Ob&s;ervations on Rever&s;ionary Payments

on &s;chemes for providing Annuities, for Widows, and for per&s;ons in Old Age, &amp;c. Being po&s;&s;e&s;t of this help, a manu&s;cript copy of the whole Con&s;titution of the <HI>London</HI> Annuity Society, e&s;tabli&s;hed by deed in|rolled in 1765, to make annual provi&s;ion for widows; and a printed Ab&s;tract of the Deed of Settlement of the Laudable Society, for the benefit of widows, be|gun in 1761&mdash;under&s;tanding, that there were no general Societies of this nature in <HI>America,</HI> and that the e|rection of &s;uch was wi&s;hed for by many&mdash;and having a de&s;ire of contributing my mite towards the happi|ne&s;s of the Coloni&s;ts, more e&s;pecially &s;ince a per&s;onal acquaintance with and numerous obligations to them, have here collected together, and do pre&s;ent to the public, materials for forming &s;uch Societies, wi&s;hing that the &s;ame may prove of exten&s;ive &s;ervice, at lea&s;t hoping that they will meet with a favourable recepti|on. The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> part contains the plan for the erection, continuance and government of the Society, with the various rea&s;ons: the <HI>&s;econd,</HI> the payments to be made by each member, according to his re&s;pective age, and the advantages he propo&s;es to obtain. The &s;cheme is larger than tho&s;e of the <HI>London</HI> Societies, as it admits of the purcha&s;ing annuities to be enjoyed, either by the purcha&s;er after &s;uch a period, or by another after his death in ca&s;e of &s;urvivor&s;hip; and, notwith&s;tanding difference of age, upon proper allowance&mdash;affords parents the opportunity of purcha&s;ing for their children, bre|thren for their &s;i&s;ters and the like&mdash;does not exclude females from becoming purcha&s;ers&mdash;nor debar military and &s;ea-faring per&s;ons, from &s;ecuring annuities to be enjoyed by them after &s;uch an age, though from pur|cha&s;ing annuities for others after their own decea&s;e.</P>
<P>Should &s;uch a Society be attempted and formed, &s;hall chearfully afford it what further a&s;&s;i&s;tance may at
<PB N="iii" REF="012406_0004_0F897774EE89A688">
any time be in my power; and, that none may be mi&s;|led by errors in any &s;purious edition of this pamphlet, &s;hall &s;ub&s;cribe my name to every copy.</P>
<P>Many might decline forming them&s;elves, notwith|&s;tanding their de&s;ires, of having &s;uch a Society e&s;tabli&s;h|ed, and of belonging thereto, from an apprehen&s;ion of their being too few. To obviate &s;o plau&s;ible an ob|jection, let it be noted, that the <HI>London Annuity So|ciety</HI> when it fir&s;t formed, the beginning of 1765, con|&s;i&s;ted of no more than twenty-one members. The beginning of this year it con&s;i&s;ted of 335. Would not with to begin &s;uch a Society with more than forty, or fifty per&s;ons at mo&s;t, as it will probably be far more ea&s;y for that number, than a much greater, to regu|late every matter, to be concluded upon at its forma|tion.</P>
<P>The hone&s;t fears of &s;ome, and the intere&s;ted views of others, may lead many to a&s;&s;ert that a Society of this nature cannot be carried on without the immediate a&s;&s;i&s;tance of able mathematicians; e&s;pecially as Dr. <HI>Price</HI> thus expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf, p. 131, &s;peaking of the Society for equitable A&s;&s;urances on Lives, viz. <Q>I would ob&s;erve, that it is of great importance to the &s;afe|ty of &s;uch a Society, that its affairs &s;hould be un|der the in&s;pection of able mathematicians. Me|lancholy experience &s;hews, that none but mathema|ticians are qualified for forming and <HI>conducting</HI> &s;chemes of this kind.</Q> 'Tis indi&s;putable, that this pa&s;&s;age was ha&s;tily worded, and that the Doctor had forgot for a moment what he him&s;elf had been doing, for in p. 133, he &s;ays, <Q>I have, with a particular view to this Society, given <HI>rules,</HI> by which may be formed <HI>every</HI> Table it can want, for &s;hewing the values of a&s;&s;urances on the <HI>whole duration,</HI> or any <HI>terms,</HI> of any <HI>one</HI> or <HI>two</HI> lives, in all po&s;&s;ible ca&s;es;
<PB N="iv" REF="012406_0005_0F897775AF6E9018">
and nothing but care and attention can be nece&s;&s;ary to enable any good arithmetician to calculate from them.</Q> By the Doctor's own rules any &s;uch arithme|tician may try the calculations in this performance, may correct any mi&s;takes, may &s;upply all defects, and may adopt other terms at plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>It may be agreeable to the reader of Dr. <HI>Price</HI>'s work, to be told, that after its publication the la&s;t year, &s;everal gentlemen of <HI>London</HI> were engaged in obtaining information as to the duration of life, both in men and women; and found that men in <HI>London,</HI> of good common health and expo&s;ed to no particular dangers, from twenty-four to the extremity of old age, die at the rate of one in thirty-one annually; and that, according to the regi&s;ters of the Million Bank, widows may live eighteen years; according to tho&s;e of the Mercer's Company (which in the year 1690 adopted a &s;cheme for paying annuities to widows) twenty-one years on an average.</P>
<P>Such Societies, be&s;ides being &s;erviceable to individu|als, will, after a while, prove of great public utility; not only by encouraging matrimony, but by furni&s;hing large &s;ums of money to be loaned out; through the help of which, young indu&s;trious planters may pu&s;h their improvements to the further enrichment of the community; others may be a&s;&s;i&s;ted in large and pro|fitable undertakings; and intere&s;t may be reduced to a more moderate &s;tate, or the exacting u&s;erer's methods of increa&s;ing it beyond what is legal, be pre|vented.</P>
<P>It being a public advantage, that there &s;hould be a full &s;upply of money to loan out; and the nature of the country (comparatively, but little &s;ettled) not allowing the thought of a redundancy, it may be prudent to extend the limits, comprehending the members of the
<PB N="v" REF="012406_0006_0F8977766F30EAD8">
Society, beyond the bounds of a particular Colony, as far as an equal degree of healthine&s;s and &s;afety will admit, that &s;o the ca&s;h of individuals, in tho&s;e provin|ces where &s;uch Societies do not exi&s;t, may centre where they do.</P>
<P>Tho' foreign to the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, yet as it may be plea&s;ing to the generality of readers, who may have no opportunity of &s;eeing Dr. <HI>Price</HI>'s performance, the following particulars are added.</P>
<P>The Doctor writes, p. 204, 205. <Q>The original number of per&s;ons, who in 1643, had &s;ettled in <HI>New-England</HI> was 21,200. Ever &s;ince it is reckoned, that more have left them than have gone to them. In the year 1760, they were increa&s;ed to half a million. They, have, therefore, all along doubled their own number in twenty-five years. And if they continue to increa&s;e in the &s;ame rate, they will, &s;eventy years hence, in <HI>New-England</HI> alone, be four millions; and in all <HI>North-America,</HI> above twice the number of inhabitants in <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></Q> The Doctor &s;ub|joins in a note, <Q>Since writing the above&mdash;I have &s;een a particular account, grounded chiefly on &s;urveys lately taken with a view to taxation and for other purpo&s;es, of the number of males between 16 and 60, in the four provinces. According to this ac|acount, the number of &s;uch males is 218,000. The whole number of people therefore between 16 and 60, mu&s;t be nearly 436,000. In order to be more &s;ure of avoiding exce&s;s, I will call them only 400,000.</Q> The Doctor proceeds, and upon a moderated calcula|tion infers that&mdash;<HI>the whole number of people will be</HI> 720,000. But &s;uppo&s;ing that there was this number when the &s;urveys were made, and that the inhabitants double in the time &s;pecified, they will be more than four millions in <HI>New-England</HI> in le&s;s than 60 years:
<PB N="vi" REF="012406_0007_0F89777730D36F78" MS="y">
and in fifty, the Coloni&s;ts of all <HI>North-America,</HI> what by internal population and &s;ettlers from <HI>Europe,</HI> will <HI>probably</HI> be more than double to the <HI>then</HI> inhabitants of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> For it appears from Dr. <HI>Price</HI>'s Supplement, lately publi&s;hed, that <HI>Old-England</HI> and <HI>Wales</HI> are depopulating apace, and that the inhabi|tants are now <HI>a million and a half</HI> fewer than in the year 1690, &s;ee p. 21. He further &s;ays, p. 60, <Q>the number of hou&s;es in the kingdom (meaning <HI>Eng|land</HI> and <HI>Wales</HI>) in 1766 was 980,692. Call them however a million, and the number of people in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Wales</HI> will be four millions and a half, allowing 4 &frac12; to a hou&s;e; and five millions al|lowing five to a hou&s;e. The former is <HI>probably</HI> too large an allowance; but the latter is <HI>certainly</HI> &s;o. The number of people in the kingdom may, there|fore, be &s;tated as <HI>probably</HI> not more than four milli|ons and a half; but <HI>certainly</HI> not five millions.</Q></P>
<P>When the Coloni&s;ts &s;hall have become thus numerous, and &s;hall &s;o far exceed in people the mother country, they mu&s;t either be ea&s;y and happy, in the &s;ecure and confirmed enjoyment of their re&s;pective liberties, being clo&s;ely united in one common cau&s;e; or be mi&s;erable in object &s;lavery, thro' divi&s;ions and cowar|dice; or be convul&s;ed in dangerous &s;truggles. The period is &s;o nigh, that the parent may look upon his new born infant, as a future actual partaker in the hap|pine&s;s or mi&s;ery thereof; and mu&s;t therefore be ani|mated in exerting his &s;everal powers, that &s;o it may be a day of joy and gladne&s;s.</P>

<P>The Doctor calculated on the probabilities of the duration of life, as deduced by Dr. <HI>Halley,</HI> and given in the appendix p. 316.</P>
<P>The purcha&s;er of an annuity, to be enjoyed, after his decea&s;e, by another in ca&s;e of &s;urvivor&s;hip, being a year upon probation, wherein he hazards all he has advanced, the calculation for the annual payments gives
<PB N="28" REF="012406_0035_0F8973644A3937D0">
him &s;ome credit for the &s;ame, by reckoning as though they began to be made on his commencing a member, in&s;tead of a year after.</P>
<P>In calculating the value of the additional 10<HI>l.</HI> the reckoning goes upon nine years in&s;tead of ten, as it will be but nine years after the 20<HI>l.</HI> has been &s;ecured, be|fore the right to that addition will be obtained; by this means the purcha&s;er is charged &s;omewhat more than had it went upon ten years; but far le&s;s than is allowed for, by reckoning the annual payment as tho' made when he becomes a member. Should it be thought that in ju&s;tice the calculation &s;hould have gone upon ten in&s;tead of nine years, it is only deter|mining that he &s;hall not pay for the additional 10<HI>l.</HI> till he has pa&s;&s;ed through his probation year; which may be more agreeable than the paying for the whole to|gether.</P>
<P>The tables &s;uppo&s;e that the money is put out im|mediately, accumulates continually by an uninterrupt|ed compound intere&s;t, is never lo&s;t, nor dimini&s;hed in value; now, as in fact it mu&s;t often lie by, cannot ac|cumulate at that rate, and will be &s;ubject to a dimi|nution through lo&s;&s;es, failure of intere&s;t and the like, it may be mo&s;t advi&s;eable to reckon upon no more than 4 &frac12; per cent, certain compound continued intere&s;t, and therefore Table II. goes only upon that e&s;timate. They, who are otherwi&s;e minded from con&s;idering the height of legal intere&s;t, may be convinced upon reading the following quotations from Dr. <HI>Price, viz.</HI> p. 8. <Q>In equal ages the mortality of males has been found to be greater than the mortality of females. P. 271, 272, <HI>the greater mortality of males</HI> appears on the whole to be a fact well e&s;tabli&s;hed. P. 106. The i&s;&s;ue of the be&s;t &s;chemes of this kind mu&s;t be in
<PB N="29" REF="012406_0036_0F897364B36370F8">
&s;ome degree uncertain. For want of proper ob&s;er|vations, it is not po&s;&s;ible to determine what allow|ances ought to be made, on account of the higher probabilities of life among females than males. No prudence can prevent all lo&s;&s;es in the improvement of monies; nor can any care guard again&s;t the in|conveniencies to &s;uch &s;chemes, which mu&s;t ari&s;e from tho&s;e per&s;ons being mo&s;t ready to fly to them, who, by rea&s;on of concealed di&s;orders, feel them|&s;elves mo&s;t likely to want the benefit of them.

<P>'Tis of importance, in calculating annuities, to de|termine whether the lives of females are <HI>univer&s;ally</HI> better than tho&s;e of males; and <HI>how much</HI> better: And his Honour, the Lieutenant Governor, having ve|ry obligingly communicated to me, &s;ome manu&s;cripts containing an account of the number of inhabitants, &amp;c. in <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's-Bay,</HI> taken by order in 1764, the re&s;ult was &s;uch as induced me at fir&s;t &s;ight to con|clude, that in this colony, as in many other places, the lives of females were better than tho&s;e of males: For it appeared from them, that there were 33438 hou&s;es; 41110 families; 59090 white males above 16 years old, and 64755 females, making together 123845; &mdash;and that there were 58390 white males under 16, and 55945 females, in all 114335. The whole num|ber of males and females was 238180. Though the males under 16 exceeded the females by 2445, yet the females above 16 exceeded the males by 5665. The number of towns that &s;ent in accounts was 196: &s;ome few declined, or neglected doing it. In 46 of the&s;e towns the males above, as well as under 16, exceeded the females. In 47 of them the females exceeded the males under as well as above 16. In 18 of them the males above 16 exceeded the females, and the females under 16 exceeded the males. In the re|mainder the males under 16 exceeded the females, and the females above 16 exceeded the males.

<P>BY one of your late Bo&s;ton Evening Po&s;ts, we had intelligence of a remarkable in&s;tance of the &s;hortne&s;s of human life; of 100 per&s;ons born the &s;ame year, one only remained alive the 76th year after. And by far the greater part of them died many years before.</P>

And February 4, 1771, there were twenty four of them living.</P>
<P>"Now, divide 246 by 24, and you will find that more than one of ten lived to be between 80 and 89 years old.</P>
<P>"Of the &s;aid 24, males and females being in number equal, three were baptized Anno 1682, turned there|fore into their 89th year, four in 84, one in 85, one in 86, two in 87, two in 88, two in 89, eight in 90, and one in 1691. And there being but thirty two baptiz|ed in 1690, and eight of them living February 1771, &s;hews that one of four baptized that year, have lived to be turned into their 81&s;t year. A rare in&s;tance in|deed!</P>
<P>"And there is a per&s;on now living in a neighbouring town, baptized in this, October, 1681, Aet. 91. And there are now living, in the fir&s;t pari&s;h in the town, nine per&s;ons between 80 and 90 years of age, and pro|bably about &s;o many more in the other parts of the town.</P>
<P>"And there have died in the town, the two la&s;t years, eleven aged people, including but three of the &s;aid 24 (which three died a few months pa&s;t) one Aet. 81, three 83, one 87, four 88, one 90, one 93.</P>
<P>"It may be added, that there lived in the place now called the fir&s;t pari&s;h in Rowley, four per&s;ons, the fir&s;t of whom died Anno 1716, and the la&s;t 1729, and each of the four, by the be&s;t accounts that could be had, died an 100 years old and upwards.</P>
