<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>I Am very well aware what different Effects the publi&s;hing this Letter again&s;t dear Mr.</HI> We&s;ley'<HI>s Sermon, will produce. Many of my Friends who are &s;trenuous Advocates for</HI> Univer&s;al Redemp|tion, <HI>will be immediately offended. Many that are zealous on the other Side, will much rejoice. Tho&s;e that are lukewarm on both Sides, and are carried away with</HI> carnal Rea&s;oning, <HI>will wi&s;h this Matter had ne|ver been brought under Debate. The Rea&s;ons I have given at the beginning of the Letter, I think, are &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy all. I de&s;ire therefore that tho&s;e who h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ld</HI> Election, <HI>wou'd not triumph or make a Party on the one Hand: (For I dete&s;t any &s;uch Thing) And that tho&s;e who are prejudiced again&s;t that Doc|trine, would not be too much concerned or offended on the other.</HI> Known unto GOD are all his Ways from the beginning of the World. <HI>The great Day will di&s;cover why the LORD permits dear Mr.</HI> We&s;ley <HI>and me, to be of a different Way of Think|ing. And I cannot expre&s;s my &s;elf better in re&s;pect to this, than in the Words of a Letter which I lately received from his own dear Hands.</HI></P>

<SALUTE>My dear Brother!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Thank you for yours, <HI>May</HI> 24. The Ca&s;e is quite plain&mdash;There are Biggots both <HI>for</HI> PREDESTINATION and <HI>again&s;t</HI> it. GOD is &s;ending a Me&s;&s;age to tho&s;e on either Side: But neither will receive it, unle&s;s from one who is of their own Opinion&mdash;Therefore for a Time you are &s;uffered to be of one Opinion, and I of ano|ther&mdash;But when his Time is come, GOD will do what Man cannot, namely, make us both of one Mind. Then Per&s;ecution will flame out; and it will be &s;een whether we count our Lives dear unto our &s;elves, &s;o that we may fini&s;h our Cour&s;e with Joy.</P>

<P><HI>Thus, (my honoured Friend!) I heartily pray GOD to ha&s;ten the Time of our Union in Principle as well as in Heart! And then I care not if I go with him to Pri&s;on or to Death. With</HI> Paul <HI>and</HI> Silas, <HI>I hope we &s;hall &s;ing Prai&s;es to GOD, and count it our highe&s;t Honour to &s;uffer for CHRIST's Sake, and lay down our Live<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> for the Brethren.</HI></P>

<SALUTE>Rev. and very dear Brother!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>GOD only knows what un&s;peakable Sor|row of Heart I have felt on your Account ever &s;ince I left <HI>England</HI> la&s;t.&mdash;Whither it be my Infirmity or not, I frankly confe&s;s that never did <HI>Jonah</HI> go with more Reluctance again&s;t <HI>Ninevah,</HI> than I now take Pen in Hand to write again&s;t you.&mdash;Was Nature to &s;peak, I had rather <HI>die</HI> than do it: and yet if I am faithful to GOD, and to my own and others Souls. I mu&s;t not &s;tand Neuter any longer.&mdash;I am well aware how our Adver&s;aries will rejoyce to &s;ee us differing among our &s;elves.&mdash;But what can I &s;ay? The Children of GOD are in Danger of falling in|to Error, Nay, Numbers have been mi&s;led, whom

GOD was plea&s;ed to work upon by my Mini&s;try; and a greater Number &s;till are calling aloud upon <HI>me</HI> al&s;o to &s;hew my Opinion. I mu&s;t then &s;hew that I know no Man after the Fle&s;h, and that I have no Re&s;pect of Per&s;ons any farther then is con&s;i&s;tent with my Duty to my Lord and Ma&s;ter JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P>This Letter al&s;o will undoubtedly lo&s;e me many Friends. But for this Cau&s;e among others, perhaps GOD &s;tirs me up to write it, <HI>viz.</HI> to &s;ee whether I will for&s;ake all for him or not. I think I have Truth and Scripture on my Side. I think it my Du|ty to be &s;imple and con&s;i&s;tent, and leave the Con&s;e|quences of all to GOD.</P>
<P>I fear I have been &s;infully &s;ilent too long. For &s;ome Time before, and e&s;pecially <HI>&s;ince</HI> my la&s;t De|parture from <HI>England,</HI> both in publick and private, by preaching and printing, you have been propagating the Doctrine of UNIVERSAL REDEMPTION; and therefore, if <HI>Paul</HI> reproved <HI>Peter</HI> for his Di&s;&s;imulati|on, (dear and honoured Sir!) O be not angry with me, if I deliver my Soul in telling you that I think in this you greatly CIT.</P>
<P>'Tis not my De&s;ign to enter into a long Debate on GOD's Decrees. I refer you to Dr. <HI>Edwards'</HI>s his <HI>Veritas Redux;</HI> who I think is unan&s;werable, ex|cept in a certain Point, concerning a middle Sort be|tween Elect and Reprobate, which he him&s;elf in Effect afterwards condemns. I mu&s;t fir&s;t inform you, that I think you had no Call to be &s;o explicit in the Doctrine of univer&s;al Redemption.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="004647_0006_100DB64F06EBD1F0">
If I mi&s;take not when at <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> you received a Letter from a private Hand, charging you with not preaching the Go&s;pel, becau&s;e you did not preach up Election.&mdash;Upon this you drew a Lot.&mdash;The An&s;wer was, "<HI>Preach</HI> and <HI>print.</HI>"&mdash;I have often que&s;tioned as I do now, whether in &s;o doing you did not tempt the LORD?&mdash;Common Prudence without a Lot would have directed you in that Matter.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, I never heard that you inquired of GOD, whether or not Election was a Go&s;pel Doctrine? But I fear taking it for granted it was not&mdash;you only inquired, Whether you &s;hould be &s;ilent, or preach and print again&s;t it.&mdash;However this be, the Lot came out, <HI>Preach</HI> and <HI>print.</HI> Accordingly, You preached and printed again&s;t Election. At my De|&s;ire you &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the publi&s;hing the Sermon 'till I left <HI>England;</HI> but &s;oon &s;ent it into the World after my Departure. Oh that you had kept it in! If that Sermon was printed in An&s;wer to a Lot, I can give no other Rea&s;on why GOD &s;hould &s;o &s;uffer you to be deceived, unle&s;s that hereby a Door might be opened hereafter for preaching up Election; and that GOD might give me another Opportunity, as he once did, by giving you &s;uch another Lot at<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>The Morning I &s;ailed from</HI> Deal <HI>for</HI> Gibralter, <HI>Mr.</HI> We&s;ley <HI>ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ed from</HI> Georgia&mdash;<HI>In&s;tead of coming on boa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d with me, though the Ship was not far off the Shore, he drew a Lot, and immediately &s;et forwards to</HI> London. <HI>Behind him he leaves a Letter for me, in which were Words to this Effect,</HI>&mdash;<Q><HI>When I &s;aw GOD, by the Wind which was carrying you out, brought me in, I a&s;ked Coun&s;el of GOD,<HI>&mdash;</HI>His An&s;wer you have inclo&s;ed.</HI></Q>&mdash;<HI>This was a Piece of Paper in which were written the&s;e Words,</HI> <Q><HI>Let him return to</HI> London.</Q>&mdash;<HI>When I received this, I was &s;omewhat &s;urprized. Here was a good Man telling me he had ca&s;t a Lot, and that GOD would have me return to</HI> London. <HI>On the other Hand, I knew that my Call was to</HI> Georgia, <HI>and that I had taken leave of</HI> London, <HI>and could not ju&s;tly go from the Soldiers who were committed to my Charge.</HI>&mdash;<HI>I betook my &s;elf with a Friend to Prayer.</HI>&mdash;<HI>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> Pa&s;&s;age in the fir&s;t Book of</HI> Kings, <HI>Chap.</HI> xiii. <HI>where we are told, "that the Prophet was &s;lain by a Lion, that was tempted to go back contrary to GOD's expre&s;s Or|der, upon another Prophets telling him that GOD would have him do &s;o.</HI>&mdash;<HI>This Pa&s;&s;age, I &s;ay, was powerfully impre&s;&s;ed upon my Soul.</HI>&mdash;<HI>I wrote dear Mr.</HI> We&s;ley <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ord that I could not return to</HI> London. <HI>We &s;ailed immediately. Some Months after I received a Letter from him at</HI> Georgia, <HI>wherein he wrote in Words to this Effect, "Tho' GOD never before gave me a wrong Lot, yet per|haps he &s;uffered me to have &s;uch a Lot at that Time to try what was in your Heart." I &s;hould never have publi&s;hed this private Tran&s;action to the World, did not the Glory of GOD call me to it. It is plain that dear Mr.</HI> We&s;ley <HI>had a wrong Lot given him here; and ju&s;tly, becau&s;e he tempted GOD in drawing one. And thus I be|lieve it is in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e. And if &s;o, Let not the Children of GOD, who are mine and Mr.</HI> We&s;ley'<HI>s intimate Friends, and are &s;uch Advocates for Univer&s;al Redemption, think that Doctrine true, becau&s;e dear Mr.</HI> We&s;ley <HI>preached it up in Com|pliance with a Lot given out from GOD&punc;</HI></NOTE><HI>Deal,</HI>

of &s;eeing what was in my Heart, and whither I wou'd be faithful to his Cau&s;e or not. Oh that it may be al&s;o for the Conviction of dear Mr. <HI>We&s;ley;</HI> that we may both think and &s;peak the &s;ame Things, and con&s;equently be better qualified to build up tho&s;e Souls
<PB N="9" REF="004647_0008_100DB653465B8870">
that have been lately awaken'd, in their mo&s;t holy Faith!</P>
<P>This I think may &s;erve as an An&s;wer to the fir&s;t Part of the Preface to your printed Sermon, wherein you &s;ay, <Q>Nothing but the &s;tronge&s;t Con|viction, not only that what is here advanced is the Truth as it is in JESUS, but al&s;o that I am <HI>in|di&s;pen&s;ably obliged</HI> to declare this Truth to all the World, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>That you believe what you have wrote is Truth, and that you hone&s;tly aim at GOD's Glory in wri|ting, I do not in the lea&s;t doubt. But then, ho|noured Sir, if by tempting GOD, in ca&s;ting a Lot, as before mentioned, you have thought your&s;elf in|di&s;pen&s;ably
<PB N="10" REF="004647_0009_100DB654F6C1F5A8">
obliged to publi&s;h your Sermon again&s;t Prede&s;tination, I think, in this you have been much mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>But farther; As you have been unhappy in printing at all, &s;o you have been unhappy al&s;o in the Choice of your Text.&mdash;Honoured Sir! How could it enter into your Heart to chu&s;e a Text to di&s;prove the Doctrine of Election, out of the Eighth of the <HI>Ro|mans?</HI>&mdash;Where the Doctrine is &s;o plainly a&s;&s;erted, that once talking with a Quaker, upon this Subject, he had no other Way of evading the Force of the Apo&s;tle's A&s;&s;ertion, than by &s;aying, I believe <HI>Paul</HI> was in the Wrong. And another Friend <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, who was once highly prejudiced again&s;t Election, ingenuou&s;ly confe&s;s'd, that he u&s;ed to think, St. <HI>Paul</HI> him&s;elf was mi&s;taken, or that he was not truly tran&s;lated.</P>
<P>Indeed, honoured Sir, it is plain beyond all Con|tradiction, that St. <HI>Paul,</HI> thro' the whole Eighth Chap|ter of the <HI>Romans,</HI> is &s;peaking of the Privileges of tho&s;e only who are really in CHRIST. And let any unprejudiced Per&s;on, read what goes before, and what follows your Text, and he mu&s;t confe&s;s the Word ALL only &s;ignifies, tho&s;e that are in Chri&s;t; and the latter Part of the Text, plainly proves what I find dear Mr. <HI>We&s;ley</HI> will by no Means grant, I mean, the final Per&s;everance of the Children of GOD. <HI>He that &s;pared not his own Son, but de|livered him up for us all, how &s;hall he not with him al&s;o freely give us all Things?</HI> Viz. Grace to per&s;e|vere, and every Thing nece&s;&s;ary to bring us &s;afely Home to our heavenly Father's Kingdom.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="004647_0010_100DB65724BE5B58">
Had I a Mind to prove Election and final Per&s;eve|rance, I know not that I could chu&s;e a better Text than you have cho&s;en to di&s;prove it. One that does not know you, would &s;u&s;pect you. You your&s;elf were &s;en&s;ible of this. For after the fir&s;t Paragraph, I &s;carce know whether you have mentioned it, &s;o much as once, through your whole Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>But your Di&s;cour&s;e, in my Opinion, is as little to the Purpo&s;e as your Text; and in&s;tead of warp|ing, does but more and more confirm me in the Be|lief of the Doctrine of GOD's <HI>eternal Election.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall not mention how illogically you have pro|ceeded. Had you wrote clearly, you &s;hould fir&s;t, honoured Sir, have proved your Propo&s;ition, That GOD's Grace is free to all; and then, by Way of Inference, exclaimed again&s;t what you call the <HI>Hor|rible Decree.</HI> But you knew People (becau&s;e <HI>Armi|niani&s;m</HI> of late, has &s;o much abounded among us) were generally prejudiced again&s;t the Doctrine of Re|probation, and therefore thought, if you kept up their Di&s;like of <HI>that,</HI> you would overthrow the Doctrine of Election entirely. For, without Doubt, the Doctrine of <HI>Election</HI> and <HI>Reprobation</HI> mu&s;t &s;tand or fall together.</P>
<P>But pa&s;&s;ing by this, as al&s;o your equivocal Defini|tion of the Word <HI>Grace,</HI> &amp; your fal&s;e Definition of the Word FREE&punc; that I may be as &s;hort as po&s;&s;ible, I frankly acknowledge&punc; I believe the Doctrine of <HI>Reprobation;</HI> and that GOD intends only to give a certain Number &s;aving Grace, thro' JESUS CHRIST; and that the re&s;t of Mankind are le&s;t to peri&s;h under the Imputation of <HI>Adam'</HI>s G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ilt, and will be damned
<PB N="12" REF="004647_0011_100DB65949289AC0">
for that and their actual Sins. This is the e&s;tabli&s;hed Doctrine of Scripture, and of the XVIIth Article of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> as Bi&s;hop <HI>Burnet</HI> him&s;elf confe&s;&s;es. Dear Mr. <HI>We&s;ley</HI> ab&s;olutely denies them both. And why?</P>
<Q>For if this be &s;o, (&s;ays he, Page the 10th, Pa|ragraph the 9th) then is all preaching vain. It is needle&s;s to them that are elected: For they, whether with preaching or without, will infalli|bly be &s;aved. Therefore the End of preaching, to &s;ave Souls, is void with Regard to them. And it is u&s;ele&s;s to them that are not elected: For they cannot po&s;&s;ibly be &s;aved. They, whether with preaching or without, will infallibly be damned. The End of preaching is therefore void with Re|gard to them likewi&s;e. So that in either Ca&s;e, our preaching is vain, as your hearing is al&s;o vain.</Q>
<P>O dear Sir! What kind of Rea&s;oning, or rather Sophi&s;try, is this? Hath not GOD, who hath ap|pointed Salvation for a certain Number, appointed al&s;o the preaching of the Word as a Means to bring them to Salvation? Does any one hold Election in any other Sen&s;e? And if &s;o, How is preaching needle&s;s to them that are elected, when it is de&s;igned by GOD, to be the Power of GOD unto their eternal Salvation? And, &s;ince we know not who are elect and who reprobate, we are to preach pro|mi&s;cuou&s;ly to all. If it be u&s;ele&s;s to the Reprobate, it is no more than what GOD de&s;igned to permit. It's enough that all are brought home by it that he intended.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="004647_0012_100DB65C0F53EB70">
<HI>Secondly,</HI> You &s;ay, Page the 11th, <Q>That it, <HI>viz.</HI> the Doctrine of Election and Reprobation, directly tends to de&s;troy that Holine&s;s which is the End of all the Ordinances of GOD.</Q>&mdash;For, (&s;ays the dear mi&s;taken Mr. <HI>We&s;ley</HI>) <Q>it wholly takes away tho&s;e fir&s;t Motives to follow after it, &s;o frequently propo&s;ed in Scripture. The Hope of future Rewards, and Fear of Puni&s;hments, the Hopes of Heaven, and the Fear of Hell, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I thought one that carrys Perfection to &s;uch an exlated pitch as dear Mr. <HI>We&s;ley</HI> does, would know a true Lover of the LORD JESUS CHRIST, would &s;trive to be holy for the &s;ake of being holy, and work for CHRIST out of Love and Gratitude, without any Regard to the Reward of Heaven or Fear of Hell. You remember, dear Sir, what <HI>Scougal</HI> &s;ays,&mdash;<HI>Love's a more powerful Motive that does them move.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>But pa&s;&s;ing by this, and granting that Rewards and Puni&s;hments (as they certainly are) may be Mo|tives, from which a Chri&s;tian may be hone&s;tly &s;tirred up to act for GOD; How does the Doctrine of E|lection de&s;troy the&s;e Motives? Do not the Elect know that the more good Works they do, the greater will be their Reward? And is not that En|couragement enough to &s;et them upon, and cau&s;e them to per&s;evere in working for JESUS CHRIST?&mdash;And how does the Doctrine of Election de&s;troy Ho|line&s;s? Whoever preached any other Election than what the Apo&s;tle preached, when he &s;aid, <HI>Cho&s;en through Sanctification of the Spirit?</HI> Nay, is not Ho|line&s;s made a Mark of our Election by all that preach it? And how then can Election de&s;troy Holine&s;s!</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="004647_0013_100DB65E4D5F3BA8">
The In&s;tance which you bring, Page 11, to illu|&s;trate your A&s;&s;ertion, indeed, dear Sir, is quite imper|tinent; for, you &s;ay, <Q>If a &s;ick Man knows, that he mu&s;t unavoidably die, or unavoidably recover; though he knows not which, it is not rea&s;onable to take any Phy&s;ick at all:</Q> Dear Sir! What ab|&s;urd Rea&s;oning is here? Was you ever &s;ick in your Life? If &s;o, did not the bare Probability or Po&s;&s;ibility of your recovering, though you knew it was unalterably fixed that you mu&s;t live or die, en|courage you to take Phy&s;ick? For how did you know but that very Phy&s;ick might be the Means God in|tended to recover you by? Ju&s;t thus it is in the Doctrine of Election&mdash;I know that it is unaltera|bly fixed that I mu&s;t be damned, or &s;aved. But &s;ince I know not which, for a Certainty, Why &s;hould I not &s;trive, though in a State of Nature, &s;ince I know not but this &s;triving may be the Means God has in|tended to ble&s;s in order to bring me into a State of Grace? Dear Sir! Con&s;ider the&s;e Things,&mdash;Make an impartial Application, and then judge what little Rea&s;on you had to conclude the 10th Paragraph, Page the 12th, in the&s;e Words,&mdash;<Q>So directly does this Doctrine tend to &s;hut the very Gate of Holine&s;s in general, to hinder unholy Men, from ever ap|proaching thereto or &s;triving to enter in thereat.</Q> As directly, (&s;ay you, Paragraph 11th) <Q>does this Doctrine tend to de&s;troy &s;everal particular Branches of Holine&s;s,&mdash;&s;uch as Meekne&s;s, Love &amp;c.</Q>&mdash;I &s;hall &s;ay little in an&s;wer to this Paragraph.&mdash;Dear Mr. <HI>We&s;ley,</HI> perhaps has been di&s;puting with &s;ome warm narrow-&s;pirited Men, that held Election, and
<PB N="15" REF="004647_0014_100DB6607AF2CA30">
then infers that their Warmth and Narrowne&s;s of Spirit are owing to their Principles. Does not Mr. <HI>We&s;ley</HI> know many dear Children of GOD who are Prede&s;tinarians, and yet are meek, lowly, pitiful, courteous, tender-hearted, of a catholick Spirit, and kind, and have Hope even of the mo&s;t vile?&mdash;And why? Becau&s;e they know GOD &s;aved them by an Act of his electing Love, and they know not but he may have elected tho&s;e who are now even the mo&s;t abandoned. But, dear Sir, we mu&s;t not judge of the Truth of Principles in general, nor of this of Elec|tion in particular, entirely from People's Practice:&mdash;If &s;o, I am &s;ure more might be &s;aid again&s;t you. For I appeal to your own Heart, whether you do not feel a Narrow-&s;piritedne&s;s towards, and &s;ome Di&s;union of Soul from tho&s;e that hold particular Redemption. If &s;o, then according to your own Rule, <HI>Univer&s;al Re|demption</HI> is wrong, becau&s;e it de&s;troys &s;everal Bran|ches of Holine&s;s;&mdash;&s;uch as Meekne&s;s, Love &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle St. <HI>Paul</HI> was not of your Opinion,&mdash;For, Col. iii. 12. 13.&mdash;He &s;ays, <Q>Putting on therefore (as the Elect of GOD, Holy and belo|ved) Bowels of Mercy, Kindne&s;s, Humblene&s;s of Mind, Meekne&s;s, Long-&s;uffering; forbearing one another and forgiving one another, if any Man have a Quarrel again&s;t any; even as CHRIST for|gave you, &s;o al&s;o do ye.</Q> Here we &s;ee that the Apo&s;tle exhorts them to put on Bowels of Mercy, Kindne&s;s, Humblene&s;s of Mind, Meekne&s;s, Long-&s;uffering &amp;c. Upon this Con&s;ideration, namely, be|cau&s;e they were the Elect of GOD. And all who have experimentally felt this Doctrine in their Heart,

And how then has the Doctrine of Election a direct Tendency to overthrow the whole Chri&s;tian Revelation? For, has not GOD intended this Re|velation as a Means to bring his Elect home?

<P>Further, you &s;ay, Page 18, Paragraph 19, <Q>This Doctrine makes Revelation contradict it&s;elf.</Q> For In&s;tance; &s;ay you, the A&s;&s;erters of this Doctrine interpret that Text of Scripture, "Jacob <HI>have I loved, but</HI> E&s;au <HI>have I hated,</HI>" as implying that GOD "in a litteral Sen&s;e, hated <HI>E&s;au</HI> and all the Reprobate from Eternity." And when con&s;idered as fallen in <HI>Adam,</HI> were they not Objects of his

Hatred? And might not GOD, of his own good Plea&s;ure, love or &s;hew Mercy to <HI>Jacob,</HI> and the Elect, and yet, at the &s;ame Time, do the Reprobate no Wrong? But you &s;ay, "<HI>GOD is Love.</HI>" And cannot GOD be Love, unle&s;s he &s;hews the &s;ame Mercy to all?</P>
<P>Again, &s;ays dear Mr. <HI>We&s;ley,</HI> "They infer from that Text, <HI>I will have Mercy on whom I will have Mercy,</HI> that GOD is Love only to &s;ome Men, <HI>viz.</HI> the Elect; and that he hath Mercy for tho&s;e only: Flatly contrary to which is the whole Tenour of the Scripture, as is that expre&s;s Declara|tion in particular; The Lord is loving to <HI>every Man,</HI> and his Mercies are over all his Works."&mdash;And &s;o they are; but not his &s;aving Mercy. GOD is loving to every Man; he &s;ends his Rain up|on the Evil, and upon the Good.&mdash;But you &s;ay, "GOD is no Re&s;pecter of Per&s;ons." No. For every one, whether Jew or Gentile, that believeth on JESUS, and worketh Righteou&s;ne&s;s, is accepted of him. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e Texts in the &s;trict|e&s;t Sen&s;e, GOD <HI>will have Mercy on whom he will have Mercy;</HI> nay, I will add, <HI>and whom he will he hardneth.</HI></P>
<P>You go on, Page 20.&mdash;"Again, from that Text, <HI>The Children being not yet born, neither ha|ving done Good or Evil, that the Purpo&s;e of GOD, according to Election might &s;tand, not of Works, but of him that calleth, it was &s;aid unto her</HI> (unto <HI>Rebecca) the Elder &s;hall &s;erve the Younger;</HI> they, (i. e. the Prede&s;ti|narians) infer that our Prede&s;tination, or Election, no Way depends on the Fore-knowledge of GOD".

<PB N="26" REF="004647_0025_100DB679173F89C0">
you mean Fore-knowledge as it &s;igni|fies Approbation, (as it does in &s;everal Parts of Scripture,) then we confe&s;s that Prede&s;tination and Election do depend on GOD's Fore-know|ledge. But if by GOD's Fore-knowledge, you un|der&s;tand GOD's fore&s;eeing &s;ome good Works done by his Creatures, and therefore electing them, then we &s;ay, that in this Sen&s;e, Prede&s;tination does not any Way depend on GOD's Fore-knowledge.&mdash;But I referred you at the Beginning of this Letter to Dr. EDWARDS. Read his <HI>Veritas Redux,</HI> which I re|commended to you in a late Letter, with ELISHA COLE on GOD's Sovereignty. Be plea&s;ed to read tho&s;e; and al&s;o Mr. COOPER's Sermons of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> which I likewi&s;e &s;ent you, &amp; I doubt not but you will &s;ee all your Objections an&s;wered. Though I would ob&s;erve that after all our Reading on both Sides the Que&s;tion, we &s;hall never in this Life be able to &s;earch out GOD's Decrees to Perfection: No; we mu&s;t humbly adore, what we cannot comprehend; and with the great Apo&s;tle, at the End of our Inquiries, cry out, <HI>O the Depth!</HI> &amp;c. Or with our LORD, when he was admiring GOD's Sovereignty, <HI>Even &s;o Father, for &s;o it &s;eemeth Good in thy Sight.</HI></P>
<P>However it may not be ami&s;s to take Notice that if tho&s;e Texts <Q>GOD willeth that none &s;hould peri&s;h.</Q> <Q>I have no Plea&s;ure in him that dieth,</Q> and &s;uch like, be taken in the &s;tricte&s;t Sen&s;e, then no one will be damned.

<P><PB N="27" REF="004647_0026_100DB67D120D8560">
But here's the Di&s;tinction,&mdash;GOD taketh no Plea|&s;ure in the Death of Sinners, &s;o as to delight &s;imply in their Death; tho' he delights to magnify his Ju&s;tice in their Death. As a Judge may take no Plea&s;ure in condemning a Criminal, and yet ju&s;tly permit him to be executed (though in his Power to procure him a Reprieve) in Order that he may &s;atisfy the Ju&s;tice of the Law.</P>
<P>I could hint farther, that you unju&s;tly charge the Doctrine of Reprobation with Bla&s;phemy.&mdash;But the Doctrine of <HI>Univer&s;al Redemption,</HI> in your Sen&s;e, is really bla&s;phemous.&mdash;For judge, whether it be not Bla&s;phemy to &s;ay, as you do, Page 20. <Q>Chri&s;t not only died for tho&s;e that are &s;aved, but al&s;o for tho&s;e that peri&s;h.</Q> The Text you have mi&s;ap|plied, to glo&s;s over this, &s;ee it explained by RIDG|LEY, EDWARDS and HENRY.

And then in&s;tead of pawning your Salvation, as you have down in a late Hymn-Book, if the Doctrine of <HI>Univer&s;al Redempti|on</HI> be not true; in&s;tead of talking of <HI>&s;inle&s;s Perfection</HI> as you have done in the Preface of that Book, and making Man's Salvation depend on his own Free-Will, as you have in this Sermon; you will compo&s;e a Hymn in Prai&s;e of &s;overeign di&s;tingui&s;hing Love.&mdash;You will caution Believers again&s;t working a Perfec|tion out of their own Hearts, and print another Ser|mon, the rever&s;e of this, and entitle it, <HI>Free Grace indeed.</HI> Free, not becau&s;e free to all; but free, be|cau&s;e GOD may with-hold or give it to whom and when he plea&s;es.</P>
<P>Till you do this, I mu&s;t doubt whether you know your&s;elf. In the mean while I cannot but blame you for cen&s;uring the Clergy of our Church for not keeping to their Articles, when you your&s;elf by your Principles, po&s;itively deny the IXth, Xth, &amp; XVIIth. Dear Sir! the&s;e Things ought not &s;o to be. GOD knows my Heart! As I told you before, &s;o I declare again, nothing but a &s;ingle Regard to the Honour of CHRIST has forced this Letter from me. I love and honour you for his Sake; and when I come to Judg|ment, I may thank you before Men and Angels, for what you have, under GOD, done for my Soul.</P>
<P>There, I am per&s;uaded, I &s;hall &s;ee dear Mr. <HI>We&s;ley</HI> convinced of Election and everla&s;ting Love. And it often fills me with Plea&s;ure, to think how I &s;hall behold you ca&s;ting your Crown down at the Feet of the Lamb, and as it were filled with a holy Blu&s;hing, for oppo&s;ing the divine Sovereignty in the Manner you have done.</P>

But I hope the LORD will &s;hew you this before you go hence: O how do I long for that Day! If the Lord &s;hould be plea&s;ed to make U&s;e of this Let|ter for that Purpo&s;e, it would abundantly rejoice the Heart of,</P>
