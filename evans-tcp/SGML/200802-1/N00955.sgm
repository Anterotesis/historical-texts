<P N="1">1. They have a Compleat armour of Proof provided for them, which duely put on, and skilfully managed; will in|dubitably render them impregnable,

and &s;ecure to them &s;ignal and a&s;&s;ured Victories over all their Enemies.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Enemies they are to engage and combate with are not only &s;trong and powerful; but marvellou&s;ly poli|tick, &s;ubtil &amp; crafty, excellently skil'd, and wonderfully improv'd in the Art of War.</P>
<P>Both the&s;e Con&s;iderations are in the Words of our Text very pertinently re|commended to our notice, by the great Apo&s;tle of the <HI>Gentiles;</HI> and an affectio|nate exhortation to the patting on of the former, is grounded upon the latter, as a rea&s;on of very great and unde|niable Cogency.</P>
<P>In the Words then we may ob&s;erve two things:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>An Exhortation.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>The Ground or Rea&s;on of it.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>An Exhortation: Put on the whole armour of God.</HI> And in this there are three things to be con&s;idered.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The &s;ubject matter which the Exhorta|tion has a re&s;pect unto, the</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">. the Panoply, or whole Armour of God. Two things are implyed here.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That the Armour, the Spiritual Com|batant is to be furni&s;hed with, is not of his
<PB N="4" REF="001145_0005_0FB08E3A29FCDEF0">
own providing</HI>: No, It is the <HI>Armour of God.</HI> Kings have their Royal Ar&s;enals, where all their Stores of War are care|fully pre&s;erved, from hence their Ar|mies are &s;upplyed with Weapons of all &s;orts, and put into a Warlike Equipage fit for the field. The King of Kings and Lord of Lords hath his royal Ar&s;e|nal al&s;o, from hence Chri&s;tians receive all that royal furniture which is nece&s;|&s;ary to equip them for, and Arm them to the Spiritual Warfare.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That the Armour, the Spiritual Com|batant is to put on is not carnal, but Spiri|tual:</HI> The <HI>Graces</HI> of Gods Spirit, are the <HI>Armour</HI> here intended. The Apo&s;tle Expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf in <HI>Military terms,</HI> and cloaths his exhortation in a <HI>Souldier-like garbe.</HI> The expre&s;&s;ion is Metaphorical, Here's an excellent allu&s;ion to the &s;eve|ral &s;orts of War-like Weapons, and Ar|mour, which Souldiers are furni&s;ht with when they go out to War. This Metaphor the Apo&s;tle more largely in&s;i&s;ts upon in the Sub&s;equent context, where he runs the Analogy, and di&s;covers the particu|lar u&s;e and &s;erviceablene&s;s of the Graces of Gods Spirit, from the re&s;pect they bear unto the &s;everal pieces and parts
<PB N="5" REF="001145_0006_0FB08E3EDD55E728">
of proper armour there mentioned.</P>
<P N="2">2. We may con&s;ider <HI>the Act which the Spiritual Combatant is advi&s;ed to, or that which the Spiritual Souldier is to do with this armour: He mu&s;t put it on.</HI> The Apo&s;tle here alludes to the Cu&s;tome of Souldiers, making ready to engage their enemies. They repair to their Arms, buckle on their armour, not omitting any one piece of it, which may &s;erve either to defend them&s;elves, or annoy their ene|mies. They think it not enough to put on their head-piece, and neglect their brea&s;t-plates, Shields and Swords; No, they will be Armed Cap-a-pee from Head to Foot. It is not enough that the Souldier is well provided with ar|mour; He mu&s;t have it on, and be in a readine&s;s for the battel. Thus Chri&s;ti|ans mu&s;t get them&s;elves furni&s;hed with Grace, all the Graces of Gods Spirit, &amp; live in the con&s;tant exerci&s;e and im|provement of them. They mu&s;t be compleatly Armed to the Combat, with the whole Spiritual Armour, no piece of it mu&s;t be wanting, le&s;t being in any part naked, and void of &s;uitable defence, they become unable to make good their ground again&s;t the formidable in&s;ults of their helli&s;h adver&s;aries.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="6" REF="001145_0007_0FB08E41EEBA8640">3. We may con&s;ider <HI>the Subject Per&s;ons concern'd in the exhortation. All true Chri&s;ti|ans, All Orders, Ranks and Degrees of Chri&s;ti|ans, in all Ages and Generations.</HI> Altho' the <HI>Ephe&s;ians</HI> to whom the Epi&s;tle is in|&s;cribed were fir&s;tly concerned in it, yet all Chri&s;tians are &s;econdarily concern|ed. The Apo&s;tolical Epi&s;tles were ne|ver de&s;igned to be of private, but com|mon concernment. To put on the whole armour of God is the duty of all Chri&s;tians, whatever Station they hold, or Relation they &s;u&s;tain. This parti|cular is excellently illu&s;trated from the &s;pecial quality tho&s;e are treated in who are the Subjects of the duty here pro|pounded. The Spirit of God treats them in the quality of Souldiers, or of Per&s;ons ingaged in a Warfare. The Word of Command in our Text is per|fectly Military, <HI>Put on the whole Armour of God.</HI> It is as if the Apo&s;tle had &s;aid, Remember Chri&s;tians, that in a Spiritual &s;ence you are Souldiers, and therefore &s;ee to it, that you be compleat in Arms and Ammunition; &s;ee to it, that you &s;tand furni&s;hed with the whole of the glorious Armour, God hath provided you with, that you may be able to en|counter

with, hew your way through and put your Enemies to a rout, and confu&s;ion.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Rea&s;on or Ground of the Exhorta|tion;</HI> the rea&s;on why Chri&s;tians &s;hould thus Arm them&s;elves with, or put on the whole armour of God, viz. <HI>That they may be able to &s;tand again&s;t the wiles of the De|vil.</HI> And here we have three things.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The grand Enemy of the Spiritual Com|batant detected, the Devil: That ye may be able to &s;tand again&s;t the wiles of the Devil.</HI> The Devil is the true Chri&s;tians prin|cipal Enemy. The Apo&s;tle expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf here in the &s;ingular number, &amp; that with a peculiar empha&s;is; but yet by an u&s;ual Synecdoche, he intends all tho&s;e va&s;t, and (as to us) numberle&s;s <HI>Troops</HI> of evil spirits, who are under the conduct of the Prince of the Powers of the Air: And thus he explains him&s;elf in the 12<HI>th.</HI> ver&s;e. The <HI>General</HI> (as is frequent) is here put for the whole <HI>Ar|my</HI> under his conduct. There may be a farther notion in the expre&s;&s;ion. God would hereby let us know, that the Powers of Darkne&s;s are &s;trongly leagued, and banded together; and do all joyn as one in pro&s;ecuting the de&s;igns of Hell
<PB N="8" REF="001145_0009_0FB08E44E2925780">
again&s;t the Children of God. And whil&s;t Chri&s;tians reflect upon the va&s;t, and hideous numbers of Devils, who are with a united force continually engage|ing them, how nece&s;&s;ary is the Spiritual Armour to defend them again&s;t their wiles! How proper is that exclamation of the P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>Lord, how many are they that ri&s;e up again&s;t me! P&s;al.</HI> 3.1.</P>
<P N="2">2. We have <HI>the way the Devil takes in managing his War with the Spiritual Com|batant di&s;covered.</HI> His War is managed with <HI>Wiles, Policies</HI> and <HI>Stratagems.</HI> He ob&s;erves a <HI>Method</HI> in fighting: Thus in our Text. <HI>That ye may be able to &s;tand again&s;t</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">. i. e. <HI>The Methods of the Devil.</HI> A method is the artificial or orderly di&s;po&s;ition of the &s;everal parts of a matter or &s;ubject treat|ed upon. And becau&s;e a good judg|ment and contrivance are nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;po&s;e our thoughts, and meditations upon what&s;oever &s;ubject into an order|ly con&s;i&s;tence, or agreeable frame; therefore the Subtilties, Policies and Stratagems improv'd by Satan in con|triving, fore-laying, and managing his de&s;perate de&s;igns again&s;t the Children of God, are &s;tiled his <HI>Methods.</HI> Satan's
<PB N="9" REF="001145_0010_0FB08E4C6C244EE8">
greate&s;t &s;trength lies in the crafty wiles, and politick &s;tratagems he makes u&s;e of; and by his extraordinary dexterity in finding out, and performing his hell|i&s;h &s;tratagems, we are in greate&s;t haz|zard to be en&s;nared, and circumvented by him.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>We have the great Serviceablene&s;s of the Spiritual Armour demon&s;trated.</HI> By putting on and managing of this aright, the <HI>Spiritual Combatant</HI> &s;hall be able to <HI>Stand,</HI> that is, he &s;hall not only make good his ground, but obtain a &s;ignal a&s;&s;ured, and compleat Victory over all his Spiritual enemies. The Devil by many crafty artifices, and cunning &s;tra|tagems &s;eeks to decoy Chri&s;tians into the toils he hath &s;ecretly di&s;po&s;ed on purpo&s;e to en&s;nare and trapan them: But let them put on this armour of God, and re&s;i&s;t him &s;tedfa&s;tly in the Faith, he &s;hall flee from them, they &s;hall &s;tand, and be Victorious over him.</P>
<P>Many u&s;eful and profitable Doctrines might be offered from the Words: I &s;hall pre&s;ent you with one not altoge|ther un&s;uitable to, or improper for the pre&s;ent Occa&s;ion. From the Words then, this is the</P>

<HEAD><HI>DOCTRINE.</HI> That God in his Word, doth treat Chri&s;tians in the quality of Souldiers; Or as Per&s;ons engaged in a Warfare.</HEAD>
<P>The true Chri&s;tian is the Per&s;on con|cerned in the exhortation propo&s;ed in our Text; and his being treated in the quality of a Souldier, is that which re|commends the Word of Command to him with a more graceful and becom|ing properne&s;s. The Spirit of God in addre&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tians, doth make u&s;e of a Military &s;tile, and cloaths his expre&s;|&s;ions in a Souldier-like Dialect: And his doing &s;o &s;ufficiently di&s;covers to us the quality he treats them in.</P>

<P>This may &s;uffice for the Demon&s;tra|tion of the Doctrine. The Rea&s;ons of it follow. I &s;hall take notice but of Two.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>God treats Chri&s;tians in his Word, in the quality of Souldiers, that he may in&s;truct them more fully, in tho&s;e things he would inform them about.</HI> The Information of men is one great end the Scripture &s;copes at. It is in this re&s;pect, the <HI>Commandment is a lamp, and the Law a light. Prov.</HI> 6.23. Men are very dull, and &s;low of under&s;tanding in things of a &s;piritual nature; and therefore God is plea&s;ed to call in the help of apt &s;imi|litudes, and curious metaphorical allu|&s;ions to a&s;&s;i&s;t their under&s;tandings in the pur&s;uit of Duty. The&s;e have a &s;ingular aptitude to convey the know|ledge of truth more fully to our Un|der&s;tandings, and to &s;et them before us in a clearer light. It is a gracious effect of the Infinite Conde&s;cendency of God, that he attempers his phra&s;e to our Capacities and Apprehen&s;ions;
<PB N="22" REF="001145_0023_0FB08E6E9ADD1728">
and illu&s;trates Spiritual Truths to us, by &s;imilitudes and allu&s;ions, that are plain, and obvious to us. God him|&s;elf puts us in mind of the favour he does us in this re&s;pect. Ho&s;. 12.10. <HI>I have multiplied Vi&s;ions, and u&s;ed Simili|tudes by the Mini&s;try of the Prophets.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>God in his Word treats Chri&s;tians in the Quality of Souldiers, as a means to fa|&s;ten In&s;tructions more powerfully upon them.</HI> Scripture Allu&s;ions and Similitudes have a double advantage to effect this.</P>
<P>For,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>They exceedingly delight men, and en|gage their affections, and &s;o make the deeper impre&s;&s;ions upon their Memories.</HI> That which the P&s;almi&s;t affirms concerning the Word and Law of God in general, is true concerning the metaphorical al|lu&s;ions contained in it. <HI>They are &s;weet|er than the Honey and the Honey-comb.</HI> P&s;al. 19.10. The Souls of men are &s;ur|prizingly tran&s;ported with ravi&s;hing delight, whil&s;t they are digging and delving after the precious <HI>Oar</HI> of Di|vine In&s;tructions, that lye hid in the rich and inexhau&s;tible <HI>Mines</HI> of Scrip|ture Allu&s;ions; and the deep impre&s;|&s;ions upon their engaged affections,
<PB N="23" REF="001145_0024_0FB08E750A213748">
give advantage to their being more faithfully &s;ecured, and trea&s;ured up in their Memories. The more men love and admire any thing, the better they remember it.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Objects the Spirit of God makes u&s;e of as a Stock to graff Spiritual In&s;tructi|ons on, are for the mo&s;t part in our daily view; and by the &s;ight of them we are a&s;|&s;i&s;ted unto a fre&s;h remembrance of, and fruit|ful reflections upon tho&s;e in&s;tructions they readily afford us.</HI> We cannot look either upward or downward, on our right hand, or left, but &s;ome object or other comes in view which God hath &s;et a|part to do the office of a Monitor, or faithful remembrancer, to a&s;&s;i&s;t our re|flections on Spiritual things.

If he looks upon the dazling brightne&s;s of his glittering armour, behold! here is a monitor to put him in mind of the out-&s;hining Splendour of tho&s;e glorious Robes of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, which every Saint is Arrayed with.

Whil&s;t he &s;eeth with what a &s;tately grandeur he Marcheth after his Leader, di&s;daining to ca&s;t an eye upon the little trifling diver|&s;ions that lye in his way; will not this tell him that he mu&s;t be a follower of the Lamb whither&s;oever he goes? That he mu&s;t pre&s;s toward the mark, for the prize of the high calling in Chri&s;t Je&s;us? Doth he ob&s;erve the remarkable Silence of the Souldier, whil&s;t he awaits the Orders of his Commander, and will not this engage him to entertain the P&s;al|mi&s;ts re&s;olution, <HI>I will hear what God the Lord will &s;peak,</HI> P&s;al. 85.8.
