<HEAD>The Experiences of GOD's gracious Dealing with Mrs. Elizabeth White.</HEAD>
<P>FROM my Child-hood the LORD hath inclined my Heart to &s;eek after the be&s;t Things, and my Father's chiefe&s;t Care was to bring me up in the N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ure and Admonition of the Lord: My Nature being &s;ome-what more Mild than the re&s;t of my Si&s;ters, I was ready to think my &s;elf &s;ome Body, and with the proud Phari&s;ee, to thank God that I was not as others, not con&s;idering that I was but like a Wolf chained up, which keeps its Nature &s;till, as I by the Goodne&s;s of God have &s;een, &s;ince the Lord was plea&s;ed to lay his Eye Salve upon me. I was a great lover of Hi&s;tories, and o|ther fooli&s;h Books, and did often &s;par'd my &s;leep|ing Time in reading of them, and &s;ometimes I &s;hould think I did not do well in &s;o doing, but I was &s;o bewitched by them, that I could not for|bear; and hearing of a Friend of mine, which was e&s;teemed a very holy Woman, that did delight in Hi&s;tories, I then concluded it was no Sin, and gave my &s;elf wholly then to this kind of Folly, when
<PB N="4" REF="004841_0004_100DFFF8F48F71C0">
I had any &s;pare Time, for two or three Years. I had &s;ometimes &s;light Thoughts of Repentance, but was loath to &s;et about it, and &s;o I &s;hould put the Lord off from Time to Time with delays, thinking &s;till I &s;hould find a fitter Time than the pre&s;ent. I remember about a Month before I was married, my Father would have me receive the Sacrament of the LORD's Supper, and I was very willing to it; until I con&s;idered what was requi&s;ite to be in tho&s;e which did partake thereof, and then I began to doubt that I had not tho&s;e Things which were requi&s;ite wrought in me, as Knowledge, Faith, Love, Repentance, &amp;c. And then this Scripture came into my Mind, <HI>He that doubteth is damned if he eat, for what&s;oever is not of Faith is Sin:</HI> When I had con&s;idered tho&s;e Things I was filled with Sorrow, and could not tell what to do, I was loath to di&s;obey my Father, and more loath to eat and drink my own Damnation; in this Perplexity I &s;et my &s;elf to &s;eek the Lord for his Grace, being at that Time &s;omewhat &s;en&s;ible of the want of it; when I had thus done, I began to be comforted, verily thinking, now I had repented, and could believe in Chri&s;t Je&s;us: And having &s;ome notional Knowledge of Things, I was indifferently well &s;atisfied, thinking that when I was married, I &s;hould have more lei&s;ure to &s;erve God; and then going to the Mini&s;ter of the Pari&s;h, to be Examined before I was admitted, and finding my &s;elf able to An&s;wer him, I thought all was well with me then, and &s;o unworthy! went to the Lord's Table, not que&s;tioning but that I was in as good a Condition as any of the re&s;t which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|ceive. But ble&s;&s;ed for ever be the Lord, which broke my fal&s;e Confidence, and &s;wept away my refuge of Lies, which I then tru&s;ted in, and &s;hewed

me my &s;ad Condition I was in by Nature and Practice more clearly than ever before; and this was about a Quarter of a Year after I was married, in the Year, 1657. The Mini&s;ter being upon this Subject, Prov. 1. 23. <HI>Turn ye at my Reproof, &amp;c.</HI> Being upon the U&s;e of Trial, whether indeed we had turned to God or no? He bid us examine our &s;elves by &s;ome Marks which he then gave, and it was at this Time that God did begin to manife&s;t his Love to me, as I tru&s;t, in my effectual Vocation; here the Lord was plea&s;ed to open my Heart, as he did the Heart of <HI>Lydia;</HI> &s;o that I at|tended to the Things that were &s;poken, and I per|ceived my Heart was not right in the Sight of God, and that my Hope was but like that of the Hypocrite which peri&s;heth; when I came home I be&s;ought the Lord to turn me, if I were not yet turned to him, but yet I had not that thorow Sen&s;e of Sin, as I had afterwards: About three Weeks after, the Mini&s;ter coming to our Hou&s;e, my Husband and I was &s;peaking that we would de&s;ire him to pray with us in our Chamber, but that Time he could not &s;tay, the next Day he came and asked for me, telling me that my Hu&s;band told him that I would &s;peak with him. O how was I &s;urprized! I could not tell what to &s;ay upon the &s;udden, I was &s;o hurried in my Thoughts. O how loath was I to acquaint him with my &s;ad State! I was a&s;hamed to tell him that I was yet a Stranger to God and all Good|ne&s;s, till it was forced from me, which when he heard he did not go about to Comfort me, but he asked me, if ever I was convinced before? And I told him, Yes; &amp; he repeated the fir&s;t Ver&s;e of the 29th Chapter of the Proverbs. <HI>He that being often reproved, hardeneth his Neck, &s;hall &s;uddenly be

de&s;troyed, and that without Remedy:</HI> When I heard this I was wonderfully troubled; then there came many Sins to my Remembrance, which I had taken no notice of before, counting them &s;mall Sins; now the Time which was t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">en in reading Hi&s;tories, I remembred with bitter Grief, and I thought that there was no Mercy for me, but he pre&s;waded me there was Hope of Mercy for &s;uch as I, and that the Lord waited to be gracious to poor Sinners, and then I was a little &s;atisfied for the pre&s;ent; but then I was troubled with Bla&s;phemous Thoughts, which were very grievous to me: I thought I had a Heart wor&s;e than the Devil, and wondered that I was not con&s;umed in &s;ome &s;trange Manner. When I have &s;een a Spider, which of all Things is mo&s;t loath&s;ome to me, I have been ready to wi&s;h my &s;elf &s;uch a one, e&s;teeming of it to be in a far happie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Condition than I was; I was afraid to be in the Dark, le&s;t I &s;hould meet the Devil; I doubted whether I was Elected, I had read, that it was not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of GOD that &s;heweth Mercy: Then I thought if I were not Elected, is was to no Purpo&s;e to &s;trive, for what GOD hath decreed mu&s;t be, but yet I was unwilling to peri&s;h, I could not be &s;o &s;atisfied, although I had but little Hope to obtain Mercy, yet I could not but ask it: I was al&s;o very fervent in hearing the Word preach|ed and read, not daring to let &s;lip an Opportunity, but not without many Tears, le&s;t it &s;hould increa&s;e my Condemnation; In this Condition I remained a great while, but not without &s;ome &s;ecret Supports from the LORD, &s;ometimes by a Word ca&s;t in upon my Spirit, &s;ometimes I was refre&s;hed I could not tell how, but I &s;hould be
<PB N="7" REF="004841_0007_100DFFFED39EFAD0">
ready to think this was a Delu&s;ion: I remember the Scriptures were the&s;e, I&s;a. 51. 10. <HI>Who is among you that feareth the LORD, that obeys the Voice of his Servant, that walks in Darkne&s;s, and hath no Light? Let him tru&s;t in the Name of the Lord, and &s;tay upon his God.</HI> John 15 16. <HI>Ye have not cho&s;en me, but I have cho&s;en you, and ordained you, that ye &s;hould go and bring forth much Fruit, and that your Fruit &s;hould remain,</HI> &amp;c. Lamen. 3. 25. <HI>The Lord is good unto the Soul that waits for him, and to them that &s;eek him: It is good that a Man &s;hould both hope, and quiet|ly wait for the Salvation of the Lord</HI> &amp;c. The&s;e Words did &s;upport me very much, therefore, I writ them out and laid them in my Clo&s;et, that they might &s;till be in my Eye, that I might when I looked upon them be incouraged to hope in, and wait upon the Lord; but the&s;e Comforts were but tran&s;ient, but yet while they la&s;ted they were very &s;weet Supports, but when gone I &s;ell to doubting, thinking all was Delu&s;ions, and thus I di&s;honoured God by my Unbelief; I doubted much of my Sincerity, often &s;aying, I was an Hy|procrite, but if at any Time I was asked in what I was one, I could not tell; but had this Scripture very often in my Mind, <HI>There is a Way which &s;eemeth right unto a Man, but the End thereof is Death:</HI> And &s;o I thought I was but &s;eemingly right, and therefore mu&s;t needs peri&s;h: And in this Condition I continued a long Time, till I heard that a Hypocrite &s;eldom or never doubted his Condition, and that is was a Sign of Sincerity, to de&s;ire a &s;incere Heart; and this I dur&s;t not deny, knowing that I did de&s;ire it rather than the whole World.</P>
<P>Thus being better &s;atisfied, I re&s;olved to &s;et about my Duty, but all this while I did not &s;et
<PB N="8" REF="004841_0008_100E000110C63850">
&s;uch a high Price upon the LORD JESUS as I &s;hould, but &s;till I thought that I mu&s;t do &s;ome|thing to merit Salvation, not daring to venture my Soul with all its Concernments upon Chri&s;t, therefore I &s;hould tie my &s;elf to pray &s;ix times a Day, and then I &s;hould be &s;atisfied, and think all was well with me then. But if I at any Time failed of my Number, then I was di&s;&s;atisfied, and &s;o in other Duties; &s;o that my Comforts did not flow from the Blood and Righteou&s;ne&s;s of JESUS, but from my own Duties; but ble&s;&s;ed be the LORD, who likewi&s;e &s;hook this Foundation, even becau&s;e he had a Favour to me: For being in Di&s;cour&s;e with a Friend, he de&s;ired me to read <HI>Sheperd's &s;incere Convert;</HI> which I did; and here did I &s;ee as in a Gla&s;s my folly, for there were Signs given whereby I might try my &s;elf, whether I did re&s;t in Duties. One I remember was this, if I never &s;aw I re&s;ted in Duties, then it was a &s;ure Sign that I did; another was this, if I prized the bare performance of Duties &s;o, as to think when I prayed with &s;ome Life, that I had done very well; and again if I &s;aw but little of my vile Heart by Duties, then it was a Sign I re&s;ted in them, and that I was yet in the Way to Hell, though in the cleanlie&s;t Way, and &s;hould certain|ly peri&s;h if I re&s;ted here. Now this I plainly &s;aw was my Condition, but how to get out of it I knew not, for now I was in a wor&s;e Condition that at the beginning, finding it abundantly more hard to deny righteous Self than &s;inful Self. I thought it wonderful Strange, that I mu&s;t be &s;aved by the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of another, if ever I were &s;aved; O this my proud Heart was un|willing to yield to, and yet I was very de&s;irous of Salvation: But when the Lord had led me
<PB N="9" REF="004841_0009_100E00029AA818C0">
into my own Heart, and &s;hewed me the Vilene&s;s of that more, and that if the Lord &s;hould leave me to my&s;elf, I &s;hould commit all kind of Sin, and that with greedine&s;s, &s;uch was the Vilene&s;s of my Na|ture, and that if it were po&s;&s;ible I &s;hould now live holily, yet I could not &s;atisfy the Ju&s;tice of God for what was pa&s;t, therefore I re&s;olved to ca&s;t my &s;elf upon Chri&s;t Je&s;us that &s;ure Foundation, which GOD had laid and not Man, and if I peri&s;hed, to peri&s;h here; but much Oppo&s;ition did I meet with from Satan and my own Heart, before I could really do it. I could &s;eal to the Truth of that Scripture, <HI>Eph.</HI> 1. 19. That GOD did put forth his mighty Power, when a Soul was made to be|lieve; but yet I was not at quiet, but had many Fears and Doubts that all was fal&s;e, becau&s;e I had been &s;o often deceived, and now I began to &s;ee mine own Vilene&s;s more then ever, and found mine Heart ran out to the LORD JESUS in Love, but doubted very much of his Love to me, yet &s;ometimes I &s;hould have &s;ome Per&s;wa&s;ions of my Intere&s;t in CHRIST, and that his Love was towards me; and whil&s;t this Per&s;wa|&s;ion la&s;ted I &s;hould be very comfortable, and be ready to think, I &s;hould never be moved, as <HI>David</HI> did: But when GOD hid his Face, I was troubled and fell to doubting all again, nor having learned that Heavenly Skill of living by Faith, but yet I did not wholly ca&s;t off my Confidence, but had &s;ome Pin-hole of Hope in the wor&s;t Condition. I remember the Con&s;ideration of this Scripture, John 3. 8. <HI>He that is born of GOD doth not commit Sin,</HI> filled me with many Fears, know|ing how apt I was to commit Sin, notwith&s;tanding my &s;triving again&s;t it: But a little while after I was &s;atisfied, under&s;tanding the Place better, that
<PB N="10" REF="004841_0010_100DEED906CDBEB8">
it was not meant of Sins of Infirmity, but of making Sin one's Trade, &amp;c. And this I was confident I did not, but rather trembled at the Thoughts of it; but when this was over, Satan and my own unbelieving Heart would &s;till be pre&s;enting &s;ome|thing whereby to occa&s;ion Doubts, &s;o that for the &s;pace of one Year and a Half, I had &s;carcely any &s;ettled Peace, now and then a good Word thrown in which would revive me for the pre&s;ent, but the Comfort would be &s;oon gone; as Ezek. 30. 26.<HI>A new Heart will I give, and a new Spirit will I put in you, and I will take away the &s;tony&punc; Heart out of your Fle&s;h, and I will give you a Heart of Fle&s;h, and will put my Spirit within you, and cau&s;e you to walk in my Statutes,</HI> &amp;c This Promi&s;e I did often plead with God very &s;en&s;ibly, and with much Confidence. Another was, John 11 25. <HI>I am the Re&s;urrection and the Life, he that believeth on me, though he were dead, yet &s;hall he live: And who&s;o|ever liveth and believeth in me &s;hall never die.</HI> This I remember was very &s;weet to me; once when I was in great Fear lea&s;t my Heart &s;hould grow dead, and when I was with Child, I was much de|jected, having a Sen&s;e of my approaching Danger, and wanting an A&s;&s;urance of my everla&s;ting Hap|pine&s;s; but whil&s;t I was con&s;idering of the&s;e Things, I had this Scripture &s;et home with a|bundance of Sweetne&s;s, P&s;al. 53. 15. <HI>Call upon me in the Day of Trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou &s;halt glorify me:</HI> And in the Time of Extremity this Word was &s;et home upon my Heart again, and my good GOD made me to Experience the Truth of it in a wonderful Manner, for I had &s;peedy Deliverance beyond my Expectation, which filled my Heart and Mouth with Prai&s;es to the LORD; about three Days after a Friend coming
<PB N="11" REF="004841_0011_100E0006EEA50E28">
to vi&s;it me, I related to her how good the LORD had been unto me, and how &s;weetly my Heart was e&s;tabli&s;hed, but no &s;ooner was my Friend gone, but I was tempted to think my Faith was fal&s;e, but I laboured what I could to encourage my &s;elf in the LORD my GOD.</P>
<P>But as I lay in my Bed, I thought I &s;aw three Men before me, and it was pre&s;ently &s;ug|ge&s;ted to me that the&s;e were the three Per&s;ons in the Trinity; O then I was very much troubled, but I knew I was under a Temptation, and therefore cryed to the LORD for Help, but was not pre&s;ently delivered from it; but I had this Scripture brought to my Mind, <HI>No Man &s;hall &s;ee my Face and live,</HI> Exod. 33. 20. But not being yet freed, I began to con&s;ider what I had heard and read as Means to help again&s;t &s;uch Temptations, at la&s;t I remembred, that Mr. <HI>Bolton</HI> in his Book of In&s;tructions for right comforting of afflicted Con&s;ciences, gave this Direction, after the Party had prayed for Help again&s;t the Tempter, and done what they could in repelling him by the Word of GOD, that if they were yet followed by Satan, that then they &s;hould &s;et about &s;ome hone&s;t Imployment; but now I was in Bed, and knew not what to &s;et about for the pre&s;ent, at la&s;t I re|&s;olved to try to Suckle my Child, which I did, and then lay down again, and found that I was pretty well freed from that Temptation, and finding my &s;elf much di&s;tempered in my Head, I de&s;ired the Lord to give me Re&s;t, and went about to compo&s;e my &s;elf to Sleep; but as I lay, I thought Satan &s;tood before me, asking where I could find a Promi&s;e for Sleep, at pre|&s;ent I could not think of any, but after &s;ome &s;tudy this was brought into my Mind, <HI>The Lord will
<PB N="12" REF="004841_0012_100E00094FD77B20">
give his Beloved Sleep:</HI> This Word comforted me, but yet I could not all that Night get any Sleep, but &s;till thought I &s;aw Satan laughing at me, be|cau&s;e I had no Sleep, and yet tru&s;ted in his Word; thus all the Night I continued weak in Body, and comfortle&s;s in Mind, &s;o that in the Morning I expected nothing but Death, then be|ginning to think more &s;eriou&s;ly of my Change, Satan as I then thought, asked me where was my A&s;&s;urance of my everla&s;ting Happine&s;s? At this I was very much troubled, knowing I had not full A&s;&s;urance, but yet &s;ome good Hope through the Goodne&s;s of GOD I had, therefore my Heart made An&s;wer, it is true, I have no A&s;&s;urance, but I have ca&s;t my &s;elf wholly upon the Lord Chri&s;t, and in him only is my Hope, and here will I Re&s;t, and if I peri&s;h, I peri&s;h, but &s;ure I am &s;uch &s;hall not peri&s;h, for Chri&s;t hath promi&s;ed them eternal Lief. Thus being a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Lord, I vanqui&s;hed Satan for that Time: And being thus at Peace, I quickly fell a&s;leep, and dreamed there was a Ladder &s;et upon the Earth, who&s;e top reached to Heaven, and I thought I was to go up, I was pulled do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n again, which cau&s;ed me to &s;hed abundance of Tears, fearing that I &s;hould never get up, and I tho't &s;omething from above drew me by the Arms, but I could not &s;ee what, but at la&s;t I thought I was in Heaven, where all Tears were wiped from mine Eyes, and I was filled with Rejoycing, but when I had been there a little while, I thought I was to go back again to the Earth, and this very much troubled me: But then I thought I heard a Voice &s;aying, it would be but for a little while, and that
<PB N="13" REF="004841_0013_100E000AD8E8C908">
I &s;hould die in Child-bed,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Which accordingly came to pa&s;s about twelve Years after her Marriage.</NOTE> and that the Night before I died, I &s;hould have full A&s;&s;urance; this very much rejoyced me, (and I was very de&s;irous to know of what Child I &s;hould die) but that was denied me upon this Account, becau&s;e I &s;hould be always prepared, but when I did awake I was filled with inexpre&s;&s;ible joy, earne&s;tly longing to be Di&s;&s;olved, and to be with Chri&s;t, which was be&s;t of all, and yet willing, if the Lord plea&s;ed to &s;uffer any Thing which might be inflicted on me. Then I remembred how Satan when I was about to turn to GOD, would pre&s;ent the Sufferings of GOD's People to me, thinking by that Means to turn me back again, and how I &s;hould be di&s;|couraged by them, but being filled with the Joys of God's Spirit, I thought I could &s;uffer any Thing, not wondering, as I had done, how the Saints of old could bear up &s;o bravely under their Sufferings. But after I began to amend, my Joys were not &s;o full, as they had been, but I had a more &s;ettled Peace than formerly I had, ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord; I had many various Changes in my &s;piritual State, but once having a great Sen&s;e of a hard Heart, and being de&s;irous to have it modified, I was tempted to do &s;ome great Evil, as the only Means to break it; and that it might be the readier entertain'd, Satan put it into my Heart, to con&s;ider the Condition of <HI>Nathaniel Butler,</HI> who&s;e Heart was unbroken till the Com|mi&s;&s;ion of that horrid Sin of Murder, and then this great Evil brought him to a Sight and Sen&s;e of all Sin. This Temptation was very &s;trong

upon me, but yet &s;tronger was he that was with me, than he that was again&s;t me: for at that very In&s;tant did the Lord ca&s;t into my Heart that happy Word, Rom. 8.3 <HI>Let us do Evil, that Good may come, who&s;e Damnation is ju&s;t</HI> This Word proved a happy Means to repel the Temptation; but yet this Mercy I had forgot, till the Lord revived it upon my Heart, almo&s;t two Years after as I was reading the Chapter.</P>
<P>And &s;ince my Child was weaned, I was in &s;uch a State of Deadne&s;s and Darkne&s;s, that I thought if I was ever rai&s;ed out of it, I &s;hould never que&s;tion my Condition again; I was tempted to think that the Scripture was not the Word of GOD? I had let out my Affection in a wonderful Mea&s;ure to my Child, and yet my Lord for&s;ook me not, but di&s;pelled my Darkne&s;s, and filled me with Rejoycing; O what &s;hall I render to Him? After this I grew into another Damp and was rai&s;ed again, and I tru&s;t the Lord will keep me, notwithstanding all the mi&s;t which &s;hall be rai&s;ed in my Heart by Sin and Satan, even by his Power through Faith unto Salvation. The&s;e Scriptures revived me at &s;everal Times, when I was in Heavine&s;s for want of the Pre&s;ence of God at the Ordinance of the LORD's Supper, Prov 8.34 <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are they that watch daily at my Gates, waiting at the Po&s;ts of my Doors</HI> Math. 20.15. <HI>Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with my own</HI> This checked me and made me wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ing to wait at that Time; But this is my Comfort, God is Unchangeable, who I tru&s;t will carry me through all the Difficulties I &s;hall meet with here below, and I tru&s;t will ere long bring me to the Enjoyment of himself, where I &s;hall be pa&s;t Sinning and Sorrowing.

I know my Love is not &s;o great as it &s;hould be; but I am &s;ure my greate&s;t Grief is that I can Love him no better, and in this Ca&s;e GOD will accept the Will for the Deed.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> I know my Love is &s;incere by this, becau&s;e I love the Children of GOD, for as it is, 1 John 5. 1 <HI>Every one that loveth him that begat, loveth him al&s;o that is begotten of him;</HI> And by this I know that I love the Children of GOD, becau&s;e I love GOD; &s;o that this is another Evidence, that I am pa&s;&s;ed from Death to Life, even be|cau&s;e I love the Brethren. 1 <HI> John 3. 14;</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,,</HI> I can appeal to the LORD, who is the &s;earcher of Hearts, that the Breathings of my Soul are chiefly after Holine&s;s, that I might be more like unto the LORD JESUS; my De&s;ire is to &s;erve GOD in all Things, and to have a real and hearty re&s;pect unto all GOD'S Commandments, and I de|&s;ire (if it were po&s;&s;ible.) that I might never Sin more, but rather that I might behave my &s;elf in all Holy Conver&s;ation, as one that hath indeed and in Truth experienced how good and gracious the LORD is: I ble&s;s GOD I can truly &s;ay, that my hotte&s;t Conflicts are again&s;t tho&s;e Sins which are obvious only to the Eye of GOD, even my &s;inful Thoughts, tho' they come not into Action; O many a &s;ad Heart have I had when I have con|&s;idered the Vilene&s;s of my Thoughts, and yet have been unblameable in my Conver&s;ation and this is &s;till my daily Sorrow, and therefore I tru&s;t they &s;hall never be my Ruin, but that the

LORD will &s;hortly rejoyce the Heart of his poor Servant, in giving me the Victory over the&s;e and all my other inbred Corruptions, which have &s;o often made a &s;eparation between my dear Lord and my poor Soul.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> I find a great Change in my Heart as touching the Word of GOD, for whereas heretofore like a Wretch as I was, I e&s;teemed a Play-Book before it, now, ble&s;&s;ed be the LORD, I prize it before all other, and good Rea&s;on have I for it, for by it hath the LORD quickned me, and therefore as long as I live I will give up my &s;elf to walk according to the Rule of it, begging the Spirit of GOD to open the My&s;tery of it to me, that &s;o I might not only have the Letter, but the very Mind of CHRIST.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> I &s;ee nothing in my &s;elf that makes me more worthy of Salvation than another. I know that I have de&s;erved to lie in Flames, as well as any that are now in the Place of Torments, and that nothing but Mercy hath &s;tept between my Soul and everla&s;ting Burnings, and therefore I heartily wi&s;h that I might always be admiring of this free Grace of GOD in chu&s;ing me before the Foundation of the World was laid, &s;o un|worthy a Creature as I am, to &s;et his Love upon me and let go &s;o many Thou&s;ands, that were more capable to bring Glory to his Name than I am: O the height and depth, and breadth, and length of this Love of GOD in CHRIST JESUS, which hath abounded to me a poor and unworth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Creature! It is indeed &s;uch a Love as pa&s;&s;eth Knowledge, and therefore I can never &s;ufficiently admire it, while I am here in the Body, which makes me long to be di&s;&s;olved, that &s;o I might know it more clearly, and be &s;wallowed up in the eternal Admiration of it. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<HI>And the&s;e are my Principles, which I tru&s;t I &s;hall hold fa&s;t even to my Death.</HI></Q>
<P>I Believe that the Scriptures contained in the Old and New-Te&s;tament, are the Word of God, written by the Prophets and Holy Men, as they were in&s;pired by God, to be the Rule of Faith and Life to his People; I believe all that God in his Word wills me to believe, being per&s;waded by the Spirit of God concerning the Truth of it: I be|lieve that there is one only eternal God, who hath his Being from him&s;elf, and given a Being to all his Creatures, both in Heaven and Earth, and under the Earth, and from Eternity to Eternity doth what&s;oever he will: I believe that this eter|nal God-head, is di&s;tingui&s;hed into three Per&s;ons, the Father begetting, the Son begotten, and the Holy, Gho&s;t proceeding from them both: I be|lieve that God created Man in his own Image, in Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and Holine&s;s, giving him Dominion over all the Creatures, and likewi&s;e gave him Li|berty to continue in this happy Condition if he would, but he having Liberty to &s;tand or to fall in his own Hand, quickly lo&s;t that Happine&s;s which God had in&s;tated him in, by yeilding to the In|ticements of Satan, &s;o that breaking the Commands of God, he brought a Cur&s;e upon him&s;elf, and all his Po&s;terity, &s;o that all Mankind by Nature are now in a mi&s;erable Condition, Children of Wrath, Heirs of Hell, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And I do believe, that God from Eternity knew what Man would do when he had created him, &s;o that <HI>Adam's</HI> Fall did but u&s;her in, as it were, as greater Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s: For I do believe there hath been an eternal Covenant between the Father and the Son, in the electing &s;ome to Life even before the Foundation of the Earth was laid; So that no

&s;ooner had Man fallen, but God promi&s;ed a Savi|our, even the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who in his Di|vine Nature is in all Things equal with God the Father, and that &s;uch was his exceeding Love and Pity to poor lo&s;t Creatures that had broken his Commands, and made them&s;elves liable to the Cur&s;e, that rather than they &s;hould peri&s;h, he hath laid a&s;ide the Robes of his Glory and took upon him the Nature of Man, but without Sins; and that he was conceived by the Holy Gho&s;t, born of a Virgin, and while he was on Earth, was loaded <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ich Reproaches and Scorns, and did at la&s;t &s;uffer upon the Cro&s;s for the Sins of his Elect, where he bore the Weight of God's Wrath in his Soul, by his Heavine&s;s in his Agony, and &s;atisfied the Ju&s;tice of God in his Body, which was crucified till he died; and I believe that he was buried, and that the third Day he ro&s;e again from the Dead, having con|quered Sin, Death and Hell, for Believers, and that he was &s;een of his Di&s;ciples, and others, forty Days after his Re&s;urrection, and in their Sight did a&s;cend into Heaven, with the &s;ame Body which was crucified upon the Cro&s;s, where he is &s;et down at the right Hand of the Ma|je&s;ty on High, and is become a glorious Media|tor between God and Man, being anointed of God to be an eternal King, Prie&s;t, and Prophet to the Saints, who&s;e Peace he hath purcha&s;ed by the Blood of his Cro&s;s: And I believe, that at the la&s;t and great Day, the Lord Je&s;us when all his Elect are gathered in, will rend the Heavens and come down to Judge the World in Righteou&s;ne&s;s, when all Nations &s;hall be ga|thered before him, even they that Sleep in the Du&s;t of the Earth &s;hall awake, &s;ome to ever|la&s;ting

<P>The&s;e are my Principles, and I tru&s;t the LORD will &s;o fix me in them, that I may never be to&s;&s;ed too and fro with contrary Winds of Doc|trine, as too many in the&s;e latter Days are; nay I am even at this Time per&s;waded by the LORD that I &s;hall not be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ed away by the Errors of the Wicked, becau&s;e the LORD hath not only rightly informed my Judgment con|cerning the&s;e Things, but hath al&s;o given me good Hope through Grace, that he is my Fa|ther, the LORD JESUS having died for my Sins, and ri&s;en again for my Ju&s;tification, and this is that which brings Comfort to my Soul&punc; and makes me to rejoice, tho' <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ot &s;eeing, yet believ|ing, even with Joy un&s;peakable and full of Glory; &s;o I doubt not but the LORD JESUS my dear Redeemer, will &s;o &s;upport me by his Grace that what&s;oever my Condition hath been or &s;hall be here in this little Moment of Time, yet that I &s;hall not fail of Salvation through Chri&s;t in Heaven for ever, for in him only is my Hope,

<P>This Confe&s;&s;ion of my Faith and my Experi|ences was written in a Time of &s;weet Peace: my Rea&s;ons why I write them were the&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1. Becau&s;e formerly when I had enjoyed the &s;weet Pre&s;ence of GOD, and been for the Time filled with Rejoycing, yet when GOD had with|drawn the Light of his Countenance from me, I pre&s;ently fell to que&s;tioning all the Dealings of GOD with me, and &s;o di&s;honoured GOD by my Unbelief; &s;o that now being under the Sen&s;e of Love, and being de&s;irous for the Time to come to glorify GOD more in the great Work of believing, I write down my Experiences, hoping they may be &s;weet Supports to me in a Time of Darkne&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">2. My de&s;ire to trea&s;ure up the Experiences which I have had of God's Goodne&s;s to me, was another Rea&s;on why I write them, knowing how apt I am to let &s;lip out of my Remembrance that which i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> good.</P>
<P N="3">3. I have been often called upon to &s;ee that my Principles be right, and to make &s;ure my Evidences for Heaven; and therefore that I may te&s;tify my Obedience to GOD and his Word, and that I might increa&s;e my Joy in the LORD, by believing more firmly what the LORD had done for my Soul, I &s;et about the Work of Heart-&s;earching, to &s;ee what I could find in me that brought me within the compa&s;s of everla&s;ting Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s; and &s;ome Things I found, ble&s;&s;ed be the LORD, which I thought
