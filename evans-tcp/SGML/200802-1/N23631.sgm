<HEAD>THE <HI>GENUINE EXPERIENCE, &amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I DOLLY TAYLOR, of Reading, being ap|prehen&s;ive that my di&s;&s;olution draws very nigh, have reque&s;ted the following line to be publi&s;hed after my decea&s;e in my name, as from a dying per|&s;on.</P>
<P>I was born in Chelmsford, near Bo&s;ton, June 16th, 1755; was brought up from my infancy by a kind brother, who took care of my mother (as my father died one month to a day before I was born, and had been deprived of his &s;ight from his child|hood, &s;o that he was &s;tone blind.)&mdash;My mother and brother gave me a good education; but my mind, however was given to vanity and civil re|creation, &s;o that I was introduced to the be&s;t of company among my young companions.</P>
<P>In early life I enjoyed my health, and a fine flow of animal &s;pirits, but lived without God in the world, and thought my&s;elf happy in the good e&s;teem of all my friends and acquaintance.&mdash;I had no great concern about the welfare of my immor|tal &s;oul, until the day I was &s;eventeen years of age. Having &s;pent the night before in company, I was looking that morning on the bright and rolling flame of an heating oven, when the dread|ful thoughts of a burning Hell &s;truck my mind with horror and amazement!&mdash;I &s;aw I had been dancing over the brink of de&s;truction. Having never before put this que&s;tion home to my&s;elf &mdash; What would become of my poor &s;oul? I was now convinced that my reputation among my compan|ions would never be any &s;ecurity for me, in the day of God's fiery anger. I &s;aw I had offended Almigh|ty
<PB N="4" REF="031269_0003_0FEBF062161C08C0">God, by giving my&s;elf up to vanity. My di&s;tre&s;s of mind encrea&s;ed under this conviction, until I took to my chamber by my&s;elf and mu&s;t leave it to tho&s;e who&s;e terrors of con&s;cience have been very great, to judge of my ca&s;e by their own experi|ence.&mdash;The &s;ame company I had been with but a few hours before, in all the &s;prightline&s;s of youth|ful vanity, made application to me, to know when we &s;hould have another &s;et dance; but I bid them a final adieu, and never joined my&s;elf in &s;uch company &s;ince; and it is my earne&s;t de&s;ire, that all my young friends and acquaintance might be as effectually weaned from the love of &s;uch &s;oul de|&s;troying company, as I was at that time, and have ever &s;ince been.</P>
<P>My di&s;tre&s;s of mind, however, continued for &s;ome con&s;iderable time&mdash;the friendly admonitions of my affectionate mother and kind brother, to whom I had turned a deaf ear, from time to time, were now to me like &s;o many thunder bolts from heaven, &s;o that I was almo&s;t afraid to cry to God for mercy, fearing that I had, young as I was, &s;inned away the day of God's grace. The fir&s;t gleam of comfort I receiv|ed, was in reading the fortieth P&s;alm, which I de|&s;ire every reader to turn to, and read for them|&s;elves. I then thought I could prai&s;e God for his glorious excellency, and vi&s;ited &s;everal godly mini&s;|ters and chri&s;tian friends, with a view to di&s;cover what God had done for my &s;oul; and in a little time I began to &s;cruple my ea&s;y &s;tate, upon which I concluded my&s;elf to be in a more dangerous &s;it|uation than I was before. Under the&s;e &s;cruples, in the utmo&s;t angui&s;h of mind, I fell &s;ick of a fe|ver, and my life was de&s;paired of. Being a&s;ked one Sabdath day morning, if I did not de&s;ire to have prayers put up for me, while it was tho't I was ju&s;t leaving the world? I an&s;wered, yes,
<PB N="5" REF="031269_0004_0FEBF064C7D0B3B0">but was under &s;trong temptations <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> prayers for me would prove ineffectual&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hen I &s;uddenly perceived the purity of divine ju&s;tice in ca&s;ting me off forever; and found an immediate &s;en&s;ible &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to God's will: Upon which I had a clear di&s;covery of my ble&s;&s;ed Saviour plead|ing and interceding for me at the right hand of his Father; when there was a new &s;ong put into my mouth, &s;o that I called out to my friends to prai&s;e God on my behalf, as a monument of rich grace and unde&s;erved mercy. My bodily maladies were &s;oon removed and I enjoyed &s;en&s;ible communion with the Father of Spirits. From this time I was e&s;tabli&s;hed, and have never been exerci&s;ed with like fears nor &s;cruples &s;ince, although I have of|ten times let down my watch, and have rea&s;on to lament my failings and imperfections, as an un|worthy member of Chri&s;t's church on earth, but &s;till I have a &s;trong hope, through the merits of my ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer, that I &s;hall &s;oon be out of the reach of &s;in and Satan, and &s;hall have my gar|ments wa&s;hed in the blood of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Having experienced, &s;ince that time, a great deal of God's goodne&s;s, in carrying me through &s;cenes of adver&s;ity, the mo&s;t remarkable; I think I may truly &s;ay, that had not God been plea&s;ed to bring me up out of darkne&s;s into his marvellous light, I never &s;hould have been enabled (as I have) to endure my temporal afflictions with that pa|tience and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion which I a&s;cribe to the grace of God alone, and not to any virtue or goodne&s;s in my natural con&s;titution and temper; for I was naturally inclined to be thought of in this world, as much as any other per&s;on; but God has taught me to be contented with my lot and condition, and to &s;uffer with my family as I ought to do, through &s;cenes of calamity, trials and afflictions
<PB N="6" REF="031269_0005_0FEBF06890A53330">of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> nature; tho&s;e who are acquainted with the circum&s;tances of our family, are &s;en&s;ible, that by means of an extraordinary infirm con&s;ti|tution on my hu&s;band's part, together with long and repeated fits of &s;ickne&s;s on my part, having been bedrid for a great part of my time, for a whole year at once, &s;everal times, and wholly un|able to do &s;carce any hou&s;hold work for &s;everal years together; con&s;idering the extraordinary ex|pences that have ari&s;en, the oppre&s;&s;ions and extor|tions that have been practi&s;ed upon us with re&s;pect to our intere&s;t&mdash;and the tongues of wicked men let loo&s;e upon us, at a time when our whole fam|ily was di&s;per&s;ed&mdash;a great number of emi&s;&s;aries en|deavoring to prevent chri&s;tian charity from being be&s;towed upon us; certainly tho&s;e who are truly &s;en&s;ible of the&s;e things, mu&s;t be led to adore the good hand of God upon me, that I have not been ca&s;t down nor di&s;couraged, but that I endur|ed the&s;e trials with patience and have now rea&s;on to expect they will all work for my &s;piritual good.</P>
<P>With humility, therefore, I de&s;ire the follow|ing addre&s;s, together with the above narrative, might be printed (as &s;oon as may be) after my decea&s;e, not having been able to ri&s;e out of my chair, nor get out of my bed, for &s;everal months pa&s;t, without a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and having no expectation of &s;eeing my relations in this world, I am there|fore de&s;irous of calling upon my friends, and oth|ers, who read this narrative.&mdash;All you that are young, and in the bloom of life, more e&s;pecially; and my prayer to God is, that my experience, my &s;ickne&s;s, and my &s;ufferings, may have a proper ef|fect upon your minds</P>
<P>And now dear reader, whoever you be, of what ever age, in whatever &s;ituation, whether you be a
<PB N="7" REF="031269_0006_0FEBF06BC5691608">familiar acquaintance of mine, or not &s;o, I hum|bly intreat you to &s;ee to it, that your peace is made with God. Let not the &s;olemn truth if you being unable to change your own hearts, pre|vent you from rational and laborious attempts to call upon the Almighty God, for the gift of his holy Spirit to accompany the means of &s;alvation until you come to live in actual and daily prepara|tion for death and e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ernity.</P>
<P>I rejoice to leave many of my relations abound|ing in the good things of this life, who have been very kind to me in my adver&s;ity, for which I de|&s;ire God to reward them with &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings.&mdash; May tho&s;e who are poor in this world, &s;ee to it above all things, that they become rich towards God in good works: For the poor may do honor to the chri&s;tian religion, by cultivating all the graces of divine Spirit, as well as the rich, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">heir deeds of charity.</P>
<P>I would further exhort all nece&s;&s;itous per&s;ons, in a particular manner, not to neglect every law|ful endeavor to &s;upport them&s;elves by their own in|du&s;try; but, if after all their endeavors, they &s;hould &s;till remain nece&s;&s;itous, let them not be a&s;hamed to make known their wants to tho&s;e who are lib|erally and charitably di&s;po&s;ed &mdash; for I have found relief from &s;uch chri&s;tian benevolence in times of extremity, while our family was di&s;per&s;ed. Re|member that a graceful &amp; a becoming deportment, with a real di&s;po&s;ition to hearken to the advice of your be&s;t friends, is nece&s;&s;ary in &s;uch ca&s;es.</P>
<P>My unu&s;ual afflictions have been a profitable &s;chool to me, and I wi&s;h the remembrance of them may be &s;o to many of my readers; for we mu&s;t all appear before the bar of an all perfect &s;overeign, to be judged according to our works: Then, if we have fed the hungry, clothed the naked, vi&s;|ited
<PB N="8" REF="031269_0007_0FEBF06DD93794E8">the &s;ick, and tho&s;e that are in pri&s;ons; and if we have been careful to entertain &s;trangers for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, we &s;hall meet with an open and a|bundant admittance into the kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t. I once more exhort you that are parents, to cultivate the principles of humanity and piety in the tender minds of your children, towards the poor and the needy&mdash;and to put the mo&s;t favorable con&s;truction on the means and occa&s;ions of poverty and wretchedne&s;s among your acquaintance, and e&s;pecially among your relations; for the heart of man is apt to be mi&s;led in childhood, by the example of wicked parents, who are uncharitable and unkind.</P>
<P>Being de&s;irous of dying in peace with all men, I heartily forgive and a&s;k the forgivene&s;s of all that are concerned among my acquaintance; and now I commit my&s;elf to God, hoping that he will provide for my children, whom I leave with my hu&s;band, and with tho&s;e who have the imme|diate care of them, by his directions, under the protection of God's grace.</P>
<P>Such of my children as are able to read this nar|rative, and remember their Creator in the days their youth; may they receive in&s;truction from him who took little children in his arms to ble&s;s them.</P>

<HEAD>Living Te&s;timony of <HI>AMOS TAYLOR,</HI> of Reading, in re&s;pect to the foregoing Narrative.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is to te&s;tify, in the &s;olemn fear of Almigh|ty God, that &s;ome time in the month of Jan|uary, 1793, my tender and affectionate wife inti|mated a &s;trong de&s;ire that I would write a &s;mall narrative of her chri&s;tian experience, together with an addre&s;s to all her friends and acquaint|ance; in which I endeavored to an&s;wer her mind, as fully as if &s;he had been able to write her&s;elf.</P>
<P>She did not expect to live, at that time, and was earne&s;tly importunate with me, that I &s;hould do my endeavor to &s;ee that the &s;ame was &s;ent to the pre&s;s, in her name, as &s;oon as might be after her death.</P>
<P>It plea&s;ed God however, to continue her life until the 19th of May, 1794, when &s;he died with the pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rid fever, about one fortnight after &s;he was put to bed of a living child, which is now a|live and well.&mdash; Her deportment, in her la&s;t &s;ick|ne&s;s, was as became her profe&s;&s;ion. &s;he appeared to be wholly re&s;igned to the will of God, and to have the terrors of death removed.</P>
<P>I further te&s;tify, that in her life time, &s;he was always &s;o far from murmuring and repining at any adver&s;e di&s;pen&s;ation of divine Providence, that &s;he u&s;ually calmed my temper, as an happy in&s;tru|ment in the hand of God, to a becoming re&s;igna|tion.</P>
<P>She oftentimes expre&s;&s;ed, and of late years
<PB N="10" REF="031269_0009_0FEBF074831FE958">more than ever, an earne&s;t de&s;ire to &s;ee profe&s;&s;ors of religion acquaint them&s;elves more with the ex|erci&s;e of one another's minds in &s;piritual things. She had a great value for the privileges of private conferences, and family meetings, &s;o called.</P>
<P>She wi&s;hed to &s;ee a greater freedom among chri&s;|tians, in their enquiry into one another's welfare. She frequently intimated the great nece&s;&s;ity of being on our own watch, le&s;t we &s;hould go a&s;tray. She was &s;en&s;ible of her own imperfections, and ready to forgive private injuries. She was very liberal, in the latter part of her life, towards pro|fe&s;&s;ors of other denominations; although in her younger years &s;he had imbibed a certain degree of rigidne&s;s and uncharitablene&s;s towards tho&s;e who were not of her &s;entiments.</P>
<P>She highly valued the privilege of a go&s;pel min|i&s;try, although deprived, a great part of her time, for &s;everal years together, from attending to the word preached; which was, to her, grief un|feigned, although accompanied with a re&s;ignation to the divine will.</P>
<P>May her example, wherever &s;he followed Chri&s;t, be imitated by all profe&s;&s;ors of religion, and may her addre&s;s, which now &s;peaks, while &s;he is gone to receive her reward, be the mean of quickening all to a becoming deportment, through our Lord and Saviour JESUS CHRIST.</P>
