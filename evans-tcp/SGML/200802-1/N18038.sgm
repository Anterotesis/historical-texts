<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AS it is po&s;&s;ible the mere Engli&s;h reader may have a different idea of romance from the author of the&s;e little volumes; and may con&s;e|quently expect a kind of entertainment not to be found, nor which was even intended, in the fol|lowing pages; it may not be improper to pre|mi&s;e a few words concerning this kind of writing, which I do not remember to have &s;een hitherto attempted in our language.</P>
<P>THE EPIC, as well as the DRAMA, is divided into tragedy and comedy. HOMER, who was the father of this &s;pecies of poetry, gave us a pattern of both the&s;e, though that of the latter kind is en|tirely lo&s;t; which Ari&s;totle tells us, bore the &s;ame relation to comedy which his Iliad bears to trage|dy. And perhaps, that we have no more in&s;tan|ces of it among the writers of antiquity, is owing to the lo&s;s of this great pattern, which had it &s;ur|vived, would have found its imitators equally with the other poems of this great original.</P>
<P>AND farther, as this poetry may be tragic or comic, I will not &s;cruple to &s;ay it may be likewi&s;e either in ver&s;e or pro&s;e: for tho' it wants one par|ticular, which the critic enumerates in the con&s;ti|tuent parts of an epic poem, namely metre; yet, when any kind of writing contains all its other parts, &s;uch as fable, action, characters, &s;entiments,
<PB N="4" REF="023370_0003_0FBF3B0646525110">
and diction, and is deficient in metre only; i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;eems, I think, rea&s;onable to refer it to the epic; at lea&s;t, as no critic hath thought proper to range it under any other head, or to a&s;&s;ign it a particu|lar name to it&s;elf.</P>
<P>THUS the Telemachus of the archbi&s;hop of Cambray appears to me of the epic kind, as well as the Ody&s;&s;ey of Homer; indeed, it is much fair|er and more rea&s;onable to give it a name common with that &s;pecies from which it differs only in a &s;ingle in&s;tance, than to confound it with tho&s;e which it re&s;embles in no other. Such are tho&s;e voluminous works, commonly called Romances, namely, Clelia, Cleopatra, A&s;traea, Ca&s;&s;andra, the Grand Cyru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, and innumerable others, which contain, as I apprehend, very little in&s;truction or entertainment.</P>
<P>Now a comic romance is a comic epic-poem in pro&s;e; differing from comedy, as the &s;erious epic from tragedy: its action bring more extend|ed and comprehen&s;ive; containing a much larger circle of incidents, and introducing a greater vari|ety of characters. It differs from the &s;erious ro|mance in its fable and action, in this; that as in the one the&s;e are grave and &s;olemn, &s;o in the other they are light and ridiculous: it differs in its cha|racters, by introducing per&s;ons of inferior rank, and con&s;equently of inferior manners, whereas the grave romance &s;ets the highe&s;t before us; la&s;tly, in its &s;entiments and diction; by pre&s;erving the ludicrous in&s;tead of the &s;ublime. In the diction, I think, burle&s;que it&s;elf may be &s;ometimes admit|ted; of which many in&s;tances will occur in this work, as in the de&s;cription of the battles, and &s;ome
<PB N="5" REF="023370_0004_0FBF3B070A0A2508">
other places, not nece&s;&s;ary to be pointed out to the cla&s;&s;ical reader; for who&s;e entertainment tho&s;e parodies or burle&s;que imitations are chiefly calcu|lated.</P>
<P>Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> tho' we have &s;ometimes admitted this in our diction, we have carefully excluded it from our &s;entiments and characters: for there it is never properly introduced, unle&s;s in writings of the burle&s;que kind, which this is not intended to be. Indeed, no two &s;pecies of writing can differ more widely than the comic and the burle&s;que: for as the latter is ever the exhibition of what is mon|&s;trous and unnatural, and where our delight, if we examine it, ari&s;es from the &s;urpri&s;ing ab&s;urdity, as in appropriating the manners of the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;o in the former, we &s;hould ever confine our&s;elves &s;trictly to nature, from the ju&s;t imitation of which will flow all the plea&s;ure we can this way convey to a &s;en&s;ible rea|der. And perhaps there is one rea&s;on why a co|mic writer &s;hould of all others be the lea&s;t excu&s;ed for deviating from nature&punc; &s;ince it may not be al|ways &s;o ea&s;y for a &s;erious poet to meet with the great and the admirable; but life every where fur|ni&s;hes an accurate ob&s;erver with the ridiculous.</P>
<P>I HAVE hinted this little concerning burle&s;que; becau&s;e I have often heard that name given to per|formances, which have been truly of the comic kind, from the author's having &s;ometimes admit|ted it in his diction only; which, as it is the dre&s;s of poetry, doth, like the dre&s;s of men, e&s;ta|bli&s;h characters, (the one of the whole poem, and the other of the whole man) in vulgar opinion, be|yond any of their greater excellencies: but &s;urely
<PB N="6" REF="023370_0005_0FBF3B09465258E0">
a certain drollery in &s;tile, where the characters and &s;entiments are perfectly natural, no more con&s;ti|tutes the burle&s;que, than an empty pomp and dig|nity of words, where every thing el&s;e is mean and low, can entitle any performance to the appella|tion of the true &s;ublime.</P>
<P>AND I apprehend, my lord Shafte&s;bury's opi|nion of more burle&s;que agrees with mine, when he a&s;&s;erts, there is no &s;uch thing to be found in the writings of the ancients. But perhaps, I have le&s;s abhorrence than he profe&s;&s;es for it: and that not becau&s;e I have had &s;ome little &s;ucce&s;s on the &s;tage this way; but rather, as it contributes more to exqui&s;ite mirth and laughter than any other; and the&s;e are probably more whole&s;ome phy&s;ic for the mind, and conduce better to purge away &s;pleen, melancholy, and ill affections, than is generally imagined. Nay, I will appeal to common ob|&s;ervation, whether the &s;ame companies are not found more full of good humour and benevolence, after they have been &s;weetened for two or three hours with entertainments of this kind, than when &s;oured by a tragedy or a grave lecture.</P>
<P>BUT to illu&s;trate all this by another &s;cience, in which, perhaps, we &s;hall &s;ee the di&s;tinction more clearly and plainly: let us examine the works of a comic hi&s;tory-painter, with tho&s;e performances which the Italians call Caricatura; where we &s;hall find the true excellence of the former to con|&s;i&s;t in the exacte&s;t copying of nature; in&s;omuch that a judicious eye in&s;tantly rejects any thing <HI>outr&egrave;</HI> any liberty which the painter hath taken with the features of that <HI>alma mater.</HI>&mdash;Whereas in the Caricatura we allow all licence. Its aim is to
<PB N="7" REF="023370_0006_0FBF3B0CC56ACB88">
exhibit mon&s;ters, not men; and all di&s;tortions and exaggerations whatever are within its proper pro|vince.</P>
<P>Now what Caricatura is in painting, Burle&s;que is in writing; and in the &s;ame manner the comic writer and painter correlate to each other. And here I &s;hall ob&s;erve, that as in the former the pain|ter &s;eems to have the advantage; &s;o it is in the latter infinitely on the &s;ide of the writer: for the Mon&s;trous is much ea&s;ier to paint than de&s;cribe, and the Ridiculous to de&s;cribe than paint.</P>
<P>AND tho' perhaps this latter &s;pecies doth not in either &s;cience &s;o &s;trongly affect and agitate the mu&s;cles as the other; yet it will be owned, I be|lieve, that a more rational and u&s;eful plea&s;ure ari|&s;es to us from it. He who &s;hould call the ingeni|ous Hogarth a burle&s;que painter, would, in my opinion, do him very little honour: for &s;ure it is much ea&s;ier, much le&s;s the &s;ubject of admiration, to paint a man with a no&s;e, or any other feature of a prepo&s;terous &s;ize, or to expo&s;e him in &s;ome ab&s;urd or mon&s;trous attitude, than to expre&s;s the affections of men on canvas. It hath been thought a va&s;t commendation of a painter, to &s;ay his fi|gures &s;eem to breathe; but &s;urely it is a much greater and nobler applau&s;e, that they appear to think.</P>
<P>BUT to return&mdash;The Ridiculous only, as I have before &s;aid, falls within my province in the pre&s;ent work.&mdash;Nor will &s;ome explanation of this word be thought impertinent by the reader, if he con&s;i|ders how wonderfully it hath been mi&s;taken, even by writers who have profe&s;s'd it: for to what but
<PB N="8" REF="023370_0007_0FBF3B11616BA618">
&s;uch a mi&s;take, can we attribute the many attempts to ridicule the blacke&s;t villainies; and what is yet wor&s;e, the mo&s;t dreadful calamities? What could exceed the ab&s;urdity of an author, who &s;hould write the comedy of Nero, with the merry incident of ripping up his mother's belly; or what would give a greater &s;hock to humanity, than an attempt to expo&s;e the mi&s;eries of poverty and di&s;tre&s;s to ridicule? And yet, the reader will not want much learning to &s;ugge&s;t &s;uch in&s;tances to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>BESIDES, it may &s;eem remarkable, that Ari&s;|totle, who is &s;o fond and free of definitions, hath not thought proper to define the Ridiculous. In|deed, where he tells it is proper to comedy, he hath remarked that villainy is not its object: but he hath not, as I remember, po&s;itively a&s;&s;erted what is. Nor doth the Abbe Bellegarde, who hath written a treati&s;e on this &s;ubject, tho' he &s;hews us many &s;pecies of it, once traced it to its fountain.</P>
<P>THE only &s;ource of the true Ridiculous (as it appears to me) is affectation. But tho' it ari&s;es from one &s;pring only; when we con&s;ider the in|finite &s;treams into which this one branches, we &s;hall pre&s;ently cea&s;e to admire at the copious field it affords to an ob&s;erver. Now affectation pro|ceeds from one of the&s;e two cau&s;es; vanity or hy|pocri&s;y: for as vanity puts us on affecting fal&s;e characters, in order to purcha&s;e applau&s;e; &s;o hy|pocri&s;y &s;ets us on an endeavour to avoid cen&s;ure, by concealing our vices under an appearance of their oppo&s;ite virtues. And tho' the&s;e two cau|&s;es are often confounded, (for there is &s;ome dif|ficulty in di&s;tingui&s;hing them) yet, as they pro|ceed
<PB N="9" REF="023370_0008_0FBF3B1245E5B078">
from very different motives; &s;o they are as clearly di&s;tinct in their operations, for indeed, the affectation which ari&s;es from vanity is nearer to truth than the other; as it hath not that violent repugnancy of nature to &s;truggle with, which that of the hypocrite hath. It may be likewi&s;e noted, that affectation doth not imply an ab&s;olute negation of tho&s;e qualities which are affected: and there|fore, tho' when it proceeds from hypocri&s;y, it be nearly allied to deceit; yet when it comes from vanity only, it partakes of the nature of o&s;tenta|tion: for in&s;tance, the affectation of liberality in a vain man, differs vi&s;ibly from the &s;ame affectati|on in the avaricious; for tho' the vain man is not what he would appear, or hath not the virtue he affects, to the degree he would be thought to have it; yet it &s;its le&s;s aukwardly on him than on the avaricious man, who is the very rever&s;e of what he would &s;eem to be.</P>
<P>FROM the di&s;covery of this affectation ari&s;es the Ridiculous&mdash;which always &s;trikes the reader with &s;urpri&s;e and plea&s;ure; and that in a higher and &s;tronger degree when the affectation ari&s;es from hypocri&s;y, than when from vanity: for, to di&s;cover any one to be the exact rever&s;e of what he affects, is more &s;urpri&s;ing, and con&s;equently more ridiculous, than to find him a little defici|ent in the quality he de&s;ires the reputation of. I might ob&s;erve, that our Ben John&s;on, who of all men under&s;tood the Ridiculous the be&s;t, hath chief|ly u&s;ed the hypocritical affectation.</P>
<P>Now from affectation only, the misfortunes and calamities of life, or the imperfections of na|ture, may become the objects of ridicule. Surely
<PB N="10" REF="023370_0009_0FBF3B1B6058A7A8">
he hath a very ill-framed mind, who can look on ugline&s;s, infirmity, or poverty, as ridiculous in them&s;elves: nor do I believe any man living, who meets a dirty fellow riding through the &s;treets in a cart, is &s;truck with an idea of the Ridiculous from it; but if he &s;hould &s;ee the &s;ame figure de|&s;cend from his coach and &s;ix, or bolt from his chair with his hat under his arm, he would then begin to laugh, and with ju&s;tice. In the &s;ame manner, were we to enter a poor hou&s;e, and behold a wretched family &s;hivering with cold, and lan|gui&s;hing with hunger, it would not incline us to laughter (at lea&s;t we mu&s;t have very diabolical na|tures, if it would:) but &s;hould be di&s;cover there a grate, in&s;tead of coals, adorned with flowers, empty plate or china di&s;hes on the &s;ide-board, or any other affectation of riches and finery either on their per&s;ons or in their furniture; we might then indeed be excu&s;ed for ridiculing &s;o fanta&s;tical an appearance. Much le&s;s are natural imperfec|tions the object of deri&s;ion: but when ugline&s;s aims at the applau&s;e of beauty, or lamene&s;s endea|vours to di&s;play agility; it is then that the&s;e un|fortunate circum&s;tances, which at fir&s;t moved our compa&s;&s;ion, tend only to rai&s;e our mirth.</P>
<P>THE poet carries this very far;
<Q><L>None are for being what they are in fault,</L>
<L>But for not being what they would be thought.</L></Q>
Where if the metre would &s;uffer the word Ridi|culous to clo&s;e the fir&s;t line, the thought would be rather more proper. Great vices are the proper objects of our dete&s;tation, &s;maller faults of our pity: but affectation appears to me the only true &s;ource of the Ridiculous.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="023370_0010_0FBF3B1D94E7DA38">
BUT perhaps it may be objected to me, that I have again&s;t my own rules introduced vices, and of very black kind, in this work. To which I &s;hall an&s;wer; fir&s;t, that it is very difficult to pur&s;ue a &s;eries of human actions, and keep clear from them. Secondly, that the vices to be found here, are ra|ther the accidental con&s;equences of &s;ome human frailty or foible, than cau&s;es habitually exi&s;ting in the mind. Thirdly, that they are never &s;et forth as the objects of ridicule but dete&s;tation. Fourth|ly, that they are never the principal figure at that time on the &s;cene; and la&s;tly, they never produce the intended evil.</P>
<P>HAVING thus di&s;tingui&s;hed Jo&s;eph Andrews from the productions of romance-writers on the one hand, and burle&s;que writers on the other, and given &s;ome few very &s;hort hints (for I intended no more) of this &s;pecies of writing, which I have af|firmed to be hitherto unattempted in our language; I &s;hall leave to my good-natured reader to apply my piece to my ob&s;ervations, and will detain him no longer than with a word concerning the cha|racters in this work.</P>
<P>AND here I &s;olemnly prote&s;t, I have no intenti|on to vilify or a&s;per&s;e any one: for though every thing is copied from the book of nature, and &s;carce a character or action produced which I have not taken from my own ob&s;ervations and experience; yet I have u&s;ed the utmo&s;t care to ob&s;cure the per|&s;ons by &s;uch different circum&s;tances, degrees and colours, that it will be impo&s;&s;ible to gue&s;s at them with any degree of certainty; and if it ever happens otherwi&s;e, it is only where the failure characterized is &s;o minute, that it is a foible only which the par|ty him&s;elf may laugh at as well as any other.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="023370_0011_0FBF3B1FE1D0F798">
As to the character of Adams, as it is the mo&s;t glaring in the whole, &s;o I conceive it is not to be found in any book now extant. It is de&s;igned a character of perfect &s;implicity; and as the good|ne&s;s of his heart will recommend him to the good|natured; &s;o I hope it will excu&s;e me to the gentle|men of his cloth; for whom, while they are wor|thy of their &s;acred order, no man can po&s;&s;ibly have a greater re&s;pect. They will therefore excu&s;e me, notwith&s;tanding the low adventures in which he is engaged, that I have made him a clergyman; &s;ince no other office could have given him &s;o many op|portunities of di&s;playing his worthy inclinations.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of writing lives in general, and particularly of Pame|la; with a word by the bye of Colley Cibber and others.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT is a trite but true ob&s;ervation, that examples work more forcibly on the mind than precepts: and if this be ju&s;t in what is odious and blamea|ble, it is more &s;trongly &s;o in what is amiable and prai&s;e-worthy. Here emulation mo&s;t effectually operates upon us, and in&s;pires our imitation in an irre&s;i&s;table manner. A good man therefore is a &s;tanding le&s;&s;on to all his acquaintance, and of far greater u&s;e in that narrow circle than a good book.</P>
<P>But as it often happens, that the be&s;t men are but little known, and con&s;equently cannot extend the u&s;efulne&s;s of their examples a gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">; the

writer may be called in aid to &s;pread their hi&s;tory farther, and to pre&s;ent the amiable pictures to tho&s;e who have not the happine&s;s of knowing the originals; and &s;o, by communicating &s;uch valua|ble patterns to the world, he may, perhaps, do a more exten&s;ive &s;ervice to mankind, than the per|&s;on who&s;e life originally afforded the pattern.</P>
<P>In this light I have always regarded tho&s;e bio|graphers, who have recorded the actions of great an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> worthy per&s;ons of both &s;exes. Not to men|tion the&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">cient writers which of late days are little <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> being written in ab&s;olete, and, as they are generally thought, unintelligible languages, &s;uch as Plutarch, Nepos, and others, which I heard of in my youth; our own language affords many of excellent u&s;e and in&s;truction, finely calcu|lated to &s;ow the &s;eeds of virtue, in youth, and very ea&s;y to be comprehended by per&s;ons of moderate capacity. Such are the hi&s;tory of John the Great, who, by his brave and heroic actions again&s;t men of large and athletic bodies, obtained the glorious appellation of the Giant-killer; that of an earl of Warwick, who&s;e chri&s;tian name was Guy; the lives of Argalus and Parthenia; and, above all, the hi&s;tory of tho&s;e &s;even worthy per&s;onages, the Champions of Chri&s;tendom. In all the&s;e, delight is mixed with in&s;truction, and the reader is al|mo&s;t as much improved as entertained.</P>
<P>But I pa&s;s by the&s;e and many others, to mention two books lately publi&s;hed, which repre&s;ent an ad|mirable pattern of the amiable in either &s;ex. The former of the&s;e which deals in male-virtue, was written by the great per&s;on him&s;elf, who lived the life he hath recorded, and is by many thought to have lived &s;uch a life only in order to write it. The other, communicated to us by an hi&s;torian
<PB N="15" REF="023370_0014_0FBF3B275CA04EE0">
who borrows his lights, as the common method is, from authentic papers and records. The reader, I believe, already conjectures I mean the lives of Mr. Colley Cibber, and of Mrs. Pamela Andrews. How artfully doth the former, by in&s;inuating that he e&s;caped being promoted to the highe&s;t &s;tations in church and &s;tate, teach us a contempt of world|ly grandeur! how &s;trongly doth he inculcate an ab&s;olute &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to our &s;uperiors! La&s;tly, how completely doth he arm us again&s;t &s;o unea&s;y, &s;o wretched a pa&s;&s;ion as the fear of &s;hame! how clearly doth he expo&s;e the emptine&s;s and vanity of that phantom, reputation!</P>
<P>What the female readers are taught by the me|moirs of Mrs. Andrews, is &s;o well &s;et forth in the excellent e&s;&s;ays or letters prefixed to the &s;econd and &s;ub&s;equent editions of that work, that it would be here a needle&s;s repetition. The authentic hi&s;tory with which I now pre&s;ent the public, is an in|&s;tance of the great good that book is likely to do, and of the prevalence of example which I have ju&s;t ob&s;erved: &s;ince it will appear that it was by keeping the excellent pattern of his &s;i&s;ter's virtues before his eyes, that Mr. Jo&s;eph Andrews was chiefly enabled to pre&s;erve his purity in the mid&s;t of &s;uch great temptations. I &s;hall only add, that this character of male-cha&s;tity, though doubtle&s;s as de&s;irable and becoming in one part of the human &s;pecies, as in the other, is almo&s;t the only virtue which the great apologi&s;t hath not given him&s;elf, for the &s;ake of giving the example to his readers.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of Mr. Jo&s;eph Andrews, his birth, parentage, edu|cation, and great endowments; with a word or two concerning ance&s;tors.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MR. Jo&s;eph Andrews, the hero of our en&s;uing hi&s;tory, was e&s;teemed to be the only &s;on of Gaffer and Gammer Andrews, and brother to the illu&s;trious Pamela, who&s;e virtue is at pre&s;ent &s;o famous. As to his ance&s;tors, we have &s;earched with great diligence, but little &s;ucce&s;s; being un|able to trace them farther than his great-grand|father, who, as an elderly per&s;on in the pari&s;h re|members to have heard his father &s;ay, was an ex|cellent cudgel-player. Whether he had any an|ce&s;tors before this, we mu&s;t leave to the opinion of our curious reader, finding nothing of &s;ufficient certainty to rely on. However, we cannot omit in&s;erting an epitaph which an ingenious friend of ours hath communicated.

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of Mr. Abraham, Adams the curate, Mrs. Slip&s;lop the chambermaid, and others.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MR. Abraham Adams was an excellent &s;cholar. He was a perfect ma&s;ter of the Greek and Latin languages; to which he added a great &s;hare of knowledge in the Oriental tongues, and could read and tran&s;late French, Italian, and Spani&s;h. He had applied many years to the mo&s;t &s;evere &s;tudy, and had trea&s;ured up a fund of learning, rarely to be met with in a univer&s;ity. He was be&s;ides a man of good &s;en&s;e, good parts, and good nature; but was at the &s;ame time as entirely ignorant of the ways of this world, as an infant ju&s;t entered into it could po&s;&s;ibly be. As he had never any intention to de|ceive, &s;o he never &s;u&s;pected &s;uch a de&s;ign in others. He was generous, friendly, and brave to an exce&s;s; but &s;implicity was his characteri&s;tick: he did, no more than Mr. Colley Cibber, apprehend any &s;uch pa&s;&s;ions as malice and envy to exi&s;t in man|kind, which was indeed le&s;s remarkable in a coun|try par&s;on, than in a gentleman who hath pa&s;t his life behind the &s;cenes a place which hath been &s;el|dom thought the &s;chool of innocence; and where a very little ob&s;ervation would have convinced the great apologi&s;t, that tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions have a real exi&s;t|ence in the human mind.</P>
<P>His virtue, and his other qualifications, as they rendered him equal to his office; &s;o they made him an agreeable and valuable companion, and had &s;o much endeared and well recommended him to a bi|&s;hop,
<PB N="20" REF="023370_0019_0FBF3B334D880128">
that at the age of fifty, he was provided with a hand&s;ome income of twenty three pounds a year: which, however, he could not make any great figure with; becau&s;e he lived in a dear county, and was a little incumbered with a wife and &s;ix children.</P>
<P>It was this gentleman, who having, as I have &s;aid, ob&s;erved the &s;ingular devotion of young Andrews, had found means to que&s;tion him concerning &s;everal particulars; as how many books there were in the New Te&s;tament? which were they? how many chapters they contained? and &s;uch like; to all which, Mr. Adams privately &s;aid, he an&s;wered much better than Sir Thomas, or two other neigh|bouring ju&s;tices of the peace could probably have done.</P>
<P>Mr. Adams was wonderfully &s;olicitous to know at what time, and by what opportunity the youth became acquainted with the&s;e matters: Joey told him, that he had very early learnt to read and write by the goodne&s;s of his father, who, though he had not intere&s;t enough to get him into a charity-&s;chool, becau&s;e a cou&s;in of his father's landlord did not vote on the right &s;ide for a church-warden in a borough|town, yet had been him&s;elf at the expence of &s;ix|pence a week for his learning. He told hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> like|wi&s;e, that ever &s;ince he was in Sir Thomas's fami|ly, he had employed all his hours of lei&s;ure in read|ing good books; that he had read the Bible, the Whole Duty of Man, and Thomas a Kempis; and that as often as he could without being perceiv|ed, he had &s;tudied a great book which lay open in the hall-window, where he had read, <Q>as how the devil carried away half a church in &s;ermon-time, without hurting one of the congregation; and as how a field of corn ran away down a &s;teep hill with all the trees upon it, and covered another
<PB N="21" REF="023370_0020_0FBF3B34CCB58658">
man's meadow.</Q> This &s;ufficiently a&s;&s;ured Mr. Adams, that the good book meant could be no other than Baker's Chronicle.</P>
<P>The curate, &s;urprized to find &s;uch in&s;tances of in|du&s;try and application in a young man, who had never met with the lea&s;t encouragement, a&s;ked him, if he did not extremely regret the want of a liberal education, and the not having been born of parents, who might have indulged his talents and de&s;ire of knowledge? To which he an&s;wered <Q>He hoped he had profited &s;omewhat better from the books he had read, than to lament his condition in this world. That for his part, he was perfectly con|tent with the &s;tate to which he was called, that he &s;hould endeavour to improve his talent, which was all required of him, but not to repine at his own lot, nor envy tho&s;e of his betters.</Q> <Q>Well &s;aid, my lad, replied the curate, and I wi&s;h &s;ome who have read many more good books, nay, and &s;ome who have written good books them&s;elves, had profited &s;o much by them.</Q></P>
<P>Adams had no nearer acce&s;s to Sir Thomas or my lady, than through the waiting gentlewoman; for Sir Thomas was too apt to e&s;timate men merely by their dre&s;s, or fortune; and my lady was a woman of gaiety, who had been ble&s;s'd with a town edu|cation, and never &s;poke of any of her country neigh|bours by any other appellation than that of the Brutes. They both regarded the curate as a kind of dome&s;tick only, belonging to the par&s;on of the pari&s;h, who was at this time at variance with the knight; for the par&s;on had for many years lived in a con&s;tant &s;tate of civil war, or, which is perhaps, as bad, of civil law, with Sir Thomas him&s;elf and the tenants of his manor. The foundation of this quarrel was a modus, by &s;etting which a&s;ide, an ad|vantage

of &s;everal &s;hillings <HI>per annum</HI> would have ac|crued to the rector: but he had not yet been able to accompli&s;h his purpo&s;e; and had reaped hitherto nothing better from the &s;uits than the plea&s;ure (which he u&s;ed indeed frequently to &s;ay was no &s;mall one) of reflecting that he had utterly undone many of the poor tenants, though he had at the &s;ame time great|ly impoveri&s;hed him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mrs. Slip&s;lop the waiting-gentlewoman, being her&s;elf the daughter of a curate, pre&s;erved &s;ome re|&s;pect, for Adams; &s;he profe&s;&s;ed great regard for his learning, and would frequently di&s;pute with him on points of theology: but always in&s;i&s;ted on a defe|rence to be paid to her under&s;tanding, as &s;he had been frequently at London, and knew more of the world than a country par&s;on could pretend to.</P>
<P>She had in the&s;e di&s;putes a particular advantage over Adams: for &s;he was a mighty affecter of hard words, which &s;he u&s;ed in &s;uch a manner, that the par&s;on, who dur&s;t not offend her by calling her words in que&s;tion, was frequently at &s;ome lo&s;s to gue&s;s her meaning, and would have been much le&s;s puzzled by an Arabian manu&s;cript.</P>
<P>Adams therefore took an opportunity one day, af|ter a pretty long di&s;cour&s;e with her on the e&s;&s;ence, (or, as &s;he plea&s;ed to term it, the incence) of matter, to mention the ca&s;e of young Andrews; de&s;iring her to recommend him to her lady as a youth very &s;u&s;ceptible of learning, and one who&s;e in&s;truction in Latin he would him&s;elf undertake; by which means he might be qualified for a higher &s;tation than that of a footman; and added, &s;he knew it was in his ma&s;ter's power ea&s;ily to provide for him in a better manner. He therefore de&s;ired, that the boy might be left behind, under his care.</P>
<P>"La, Mr. Adams," &s;aid Mrs. Slip&s;lop, <Q>do you,
<PB N="23" REF="023370_0022_0FBF3B3CAA18B7D8">
think my lady will &s;uffer any preamble about any &s;uch matter? She is going to London very con|ci&s;ely, and I am confidous would not leave Joey behind her on any account; for he is one of the genteele&s;t young fellows you may &s;ee in a &s;um|mer's day, and I am confidous &s;he would as &s;oon think of parting with a pair of her grey mares; for &s;he values her&s;elf as much on the one as the other.</Q> Adams would have interrupted but &s;he proceeded: <Q>And why is Latin more nece&s;&s;itous for a footman than a gentleman? It is very pro|per that you clergymen mu&s;t learn it, becau&s;e you can't preach without it: but I have heard gentle|men &s;ay in London, that it is fit for nobody el&s;e. I am confidous my lady would be angry with me for mentioning it; and I &s;hall draw my&s;elf into no &s;uch delemy.</Q> At which words her lady's bell rung, and Mr. Adams was forced to retire; nor could he gain a &s;econd opportunity with her be|fore their London journey, which happened a few days afterwards. However, Andrews behaved very thankfully and gratefully to him for his intended kindne&s;s, which he told him he never would forget, and at the &s;ame time received from the good man many admonitions, concerning the regulation of his future conduct, and his per&s;everance in innocence and indu&s;try.</P>

of life. His hair was cut after the newe&s;t fa&s;hion, and became his chief care: he went abroad with it all the morning in papers, and dre&s;&s;ed it out in the afternoon. They could not, however, teach him to game, &s;wear, drink, nor any other genteel vice the town abounded with. He applied mo&s;t of his lei&s;ure hours to mu&s;ic, in which he greatly improved him&s;elf; and became &s;o perfect a con|noi&s;&s;eur in that art, that he led the opinion of all the other footmen at an opera, and they never condemned or applauded a &s;ingle &s;ong contrary to his approbation, or di&s;like. He was a little too forward in riots at the play-hou&s;es and a&s;&s;em|blies: and when he attended his lady at church (which was but &s;eldom) he behaved with le&s;s &s;eem|ing devotion than formerly: however, if he was outwardly a pretty fellow, his morals remained entirely uncorrupted, though he was at the &s;ame time &s;marter and genteeler than any of the beaus in town, either in or out of livery.</P>
<P>His lady, who had often &s;aid of him that Joey was the hand&s;ome&s;t and genteele&s;t footman in the kingdom, but that it was pity he wanted &s;pirit, began now to find that fault no longer; on the contrary, &s;he was frequently heard to cry out, Ay, there is &s;ome life in this fellow. She plainly &s;aw the effects which the town-air hath on the &s;obere&s;t con&s;titutions. She would now walk out with him into Hyde-Park in a morning, and when tired, which happened almo&s;t every minute, would lean on his arm, and conver&s;e with him in great fami|liarity. Whenever &s;he &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">pt out of her coach, &s;he would take him by the hand, and &s;ometimes, for fear of &s;tumbling, pre&s;s it very hard; &s;he admit|ted him to deliver me&s;&s;ages at her bed-&s;ide in a morning, leer'd at him at table, and indulged him

in all tho&s;e innocent freedoms which women of figure may permit without the lea&s;t fully of their virtue.</P>
<P>But though their virtue remains un&s;ullied, yet, now and then &s;ome &s;mall arrows will glance on the &s;hadow of it, their reputation; and &s;o it fell out to lady Booby, who happened to be walking arm-in-arm with Joey one morning in Hyde-Park, when lady Tittle and lady Tattle, came accident|ally by in their coach.

<P>But whatever opinion or &s;u&s;picion the &s;canda|lous inclination of defamers might entertain of la|dy Booby's innocent freedoms, it is certain they made no impre&s;&s;ion on young Andrews, who ne|ver offered to encroach beyond the liberties which his lady allowed him.

<P>AT this time, an accident happened, which put a &s;top to tho&s;e agreeable walks, which probably would have &s;oon puffed up the che<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ks of &s;ame, and cau&s;ed her to blow her brazen trumpet through the town; and this was no other than the death of Sir Thomas Booby, who departing this life, left his di&s;con&s;olate lady confined to her hou&s;e, as clo&s;ely as if &s;he her&s;elf had been attacked by &s;ome violent di&s;ea&s;e. During the fir&s;t &s;ix days the poor lady admitted none but Mrs. Slip&s;lop, and three female friends, who made a party at cards: but on the &s;eventh &s;he ordered Joey, whom, for a good rea&s;on, we &s;hall hereafter call JOSEPH, to bring up her tea-kettle. The lady being in bed, called Jo&s;eph to her, bade him &s;it down, and having accidentally laid her hand on his, &s;he a&s;ked him, if he had ever been in love? Jo&s;eph an&s;wer|ed with &s;ome confu&s;ion, it was time enough for one &s;o young as him&s;elf to think on &s;uch things.

<P>SINCE I received your letter of your good lady's death, we have had a misfortune of the &s;ame kind in our family. My worthy ma&s;|ter Sir Thomas died about four days ago; and, what is wor&s;e, my poor lady is certainly gone di&s;tracted. None of the &s;ervants expected her to take it &s;o to heart, becau&s;e they quarrelled al|mo&s;t every day of their lives: but no more of that, becau&s;e you know, Pamela, I never loved to tell the &s;ecrets of my ma&s;ter's family; but to be &s;ure you mu&s;t have known they never loved one another; and I have heard her lady&s;hip wi&s;h his honour dead above a thou&s;and times: but no
<PB N="30" REF="023370_0029_0FBF3B4FD5B1C5A0">
body knows what it is to lo&s;e a friend till they have lo&s;t him.</P>
<P>Don't tell any body what I write, becau&s;e I &s;hould not care to have folks &s;ay I di&s;cover what pa&s;&s;es in our family: but if it had not been &s;o great a lady, I &s;hould have thought &s;he had had a-mind to me. Dear Pamela, don't tell any body: but &s;he ordered me to &s;it down by her bed-&s;ide, when &s;he was in naked bed; and &s;he held my hand, and talked exactly as a lady does to her &s;weet-heart in a &s;tage-play, which I have &s;een in Covent-Garden, while &s;he wanted him to be no better than he &s;hould be.</P>
<P>If Madam be mad, I &s;hall not care for &s;taying long in the family: &s;o I heartily wi&s;h you could get me a place either at the &s;quire's, or &s;ome o|ther neighbouring gentleman's, unle&s;s it be true that you are going to be married to par&s;on Willi|ams, as folks talk, and then I &s;hould be very wil|ling to be his clerk: for which you know I am qualified, being able to read, and to &s;et a p&s;alm.</P>
<P>I fancy I &s;hall be di&s;charged very &s;oon; and the moment I am, unle&s;s I hear from you, I &s;hall return to my old ma&s;ter's country-&s;eat, if it be only to &s;ee par&s;on Adams, who is the be&s;t man in the world. London is a bad place, and there is &s;o little good-fellow&s;hip, that the next-door neighbours don't know one another. Pray give my &s;ervice to all friends that enquire for me; &s;o I re&s;t</P>

</LETTER>
<P>As &s;oon as Jo&s;eph had &s;ealed and directed this letter he walked down &s;tairs, where he met Mrs. Slip&s;lop, with whom we &s;hall take this opportunity
<PB N="31" REF="023370_0030_0FBF3B539F864448">
to bring the reader a little better acquainted. She was a maiden gentlewoman of about forty-five years of age, who having made a &s;mall &s;lip in her youth, had continued a good maid ever &s;ince. She was not at this time remarkably hand&s;ome; being very &s;hort, and rather too corpulent in body, and &s;ome|what red, with the addition of pimples in the face. Her no&s;e was likewi&s;e rather too large, and her eyes too little; nor did &s;he re&s;emble a cow &s;o much in her breath, as in two brown globes which &s;he car|ried before her; one of her legs was al&s;o a little &s;horter than the other, which occa&s;ioned her to limp as &s;he walked. This fair creature had long ca&s;t the eyes of affection on Jo&s;eph, in which &s;he had not met with quite &s;o good &s;ucce&s;s as &s;he probably wi&s;h|ed, tho', be&s;ides all the allurements of her native charms, &s;he had given him tea, &s;weetmeats, wine, and many other delicacies, of which, by keeping the keys, &s;he had the ab&s;olute command. Jo&s;eph, how|ever, had not returned the lea&s;t gratitude to all the&s;e favours, not even &s;o much as a ki&s;s; tho' I would not in&s;inuate &s;he was &s;o ea&s;ily to be &s;atisfied: for &s;urely then he would have been highly blameable. The truth is, &s;he was arrived at an age when &s;he thought &s;he might indulge her&s;elf in any liberties with a man, without the danger of bringing a third per&s;on into the world to betray them. She imagin|ed, that by &s;o long a &s;elf-denial, &s;he had not only made amends for the &s;mall &s;lip of her youth above hinted at: but had likewi&s;e laid up a quantity of merit to excu&s;e any future failings. In a word, &s;he re&s;olved to give a loo&s;e to her amorous inclina|tions, and to pay off the debt of plea&s;ure &s;he found &s;he owed her&s;elf, as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>With the&s;e charms of per&s;on, and in this di&s;po|&s;ition of mind, &s;he encountered poor Jo&s;eph at the
<PB N="32" REF="023370_0031_0FBF3B58ACB0FE88">
bottom of the &s;tairs, and a&s;ked him if he would drink a gla&s;s of &s;omething good this morning. Jo&s;eph, who&s;e &s;pirits were not a little ca&s;t down, very rea|dily and thankfully accepted the offer; and together they went into a clo&s;et, where having delivered him a full gla&s;s of ratifia, and de&s;ired him to &s;it down, Mrs. Slip&s;lop thus began:</P>
<P><Q>Sure nothing can be a more &s;imple contra&s;t in a woman, than to place her affections on a boy. If I had ever thought it would have been my fate, I &s;hould have wi&s;hed to die a thou&s;and deaths ra|ther than live to &s;ee that day. If we like a man, the lighte&s;t hint &s;ophi&s;ticates. Whereas a boy propo&s;es upon us to break through all the regula|tions of mode&s;ty, before we can make any oppre&s;|&s;ion upon him.</Q> Jo&s;eph, who did not under&s;tand a word &s;he &s;aid, an&s;wered, 'Yes, Madam;&mdash;' 'Yes, Madam,' replied Mrs Slip&s;lop, with &s;ome warmth, <Q>Do you intend to re&s;ult my pa&s;&s;ion? Is it not enough, ungrateful as you are, to make no return to all the favours I have done you: but you mu&s;t treat me with ironing? Barbarous mon&s;ter! how have I de&s;erved that my pa&s;&s;ion &s;hould be re|&s;ulted and treated with ironing?</Q> 'Madam,' an|&s;wered Jo&s;eph, <Q>I don't under&s;tand your hard words: but I am certain, you have no occa&s;ion to call me ungrateful: for &s;o far from intending you any wrong, I always loved you as well as if you had been my own mother.</Q> 'How, &s;irrah!' &s;ays Mrs. Slip&s;lop in a rage: <Q>Your own mother? Do you a&s;&s;inuate that I am old enough to be your mother? I don't know what a &s;trippling may think: but I believe a man would refer me to any green&s;ickne&s;s &s;illy girl what&s;omdever: but I ought to de&s;pi&s;e you rather than be angry with you, for
<PB N="33" REF="023370_0032_0FBF3B59959E5128">
referring the conver&s;ation of girls to that of a wo|man of &s;en&s;e.</Q> 'Madam,' &s;ays Jo&s;eph, <Q>I am &s;ure I have always valued the honour you did me by your conver&s;ation; for I know you are a wo|man of learning.</Q> 'Yes, but Jo&s;eph,' &s;aid &s;he, a little &s;oftened by the compliment to her lear|ning, <Q>If you had a value for me, you certainly would have found &s;ome method of &s;hewing it me; for I am convicted you mu&s;t &s;ee the value I have for you. Yes, Jo&s;eph, my eyes, whether I would or no, mu&s;t have declared a pa&s;&s;ion I cannot con|quer.&mdash;Oh! Jo&s;eph!</Q></P>
<P>As when a hungry tigre&s;s, who long has tra|ver&s;ed the woods in fruitle&s;s &s;earch, &s;ees within the reach of her claws a lamb, &s;he prepares to leap on her prey; or as a voracious pike of immen&s;e &s;ize, &s;ur|veys thro' the liquid element a roach or gudgeon, which cannot e&s;cape her jaws, opens them wide to &s;wallow the little fi&s;h; &s;o did Mrs. Slip&s;lop prepare to lay her violent amorous hands on the poor Jo|&s;eph, when luckily her mi&s;tre&s;s's bell rung, and de|livered the intended martyr from her clutches. She was obliged to leave him abruptly, and to defer the execution of her purpo&s;e till &s;ome other time. We &s;hall therefore return to the lady Booby, and give our reader &s;ome account of her behaviour, after &s;he was left by Jo&s;eph in a temper of mind not greatly different from that of the inflamed Slip&s;lop.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Sayings of wi&s;e men. A dialogue between the lady and her maid; and a panegyric, or rather &s;atire, on the pa&s;&s;ion of love, in the &s;ublime &s;tile.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT is the ob&s;ervation of &s;ome antient &s;age, who&s;e name I have forgot, that pa&s;&s;ions operate diffe|rently on the human mind, as di&s;ea&s;es on the body, in proportion to the &s;trength or weakne&s;s, &s;oundne&s;s or rottenne&s;s of the one and the other.</P>
<P>We hope therefore a judicious reader will give him&s;elf &s;ome pains to ob&s;erve, what we have &s;o greatly laboured to de&s;cribe, the different operations of this pa&s;&s;ion of love in the gentle and cultivated mind of the lady Booby, from tho&s;e which it effect|ed in the le&s;s poli&s;hed and coar&s;er di&s;po&s;ition of Mrs. Slip&s;lop.</P>
<P>Another philo&s;opher, who&s;e name al&s;o at pre&s;ent e&s;capes my memory, hath &s;omewhere &s;aid, that re|&s;olutions taken in the ab&s;ence of the beloved object, are very apt to vani&s;h in its pre&s;ence; on both which wi&s;e &s;ayings, the following chapter may &s;erve as a comment.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner had Jo&s;eph left the room in the man|ner we had before related, than the lady, enraged at her di&s;appointment, began to reflect with &s;everity on her conduct. Her love was now changed to di&s;dain, which pride a&s;&s;i&s;ted to torment her. She de&s;pi&s;ed her&s;elf for the meanne&s;s of her pa&s;&s;ion, and Jo&s;eph for its ill &s;ucce&s;s. However, &s;he had now got the better of it in her own opinion, and deter|mined immediately to di&s;mi&s;s the object. After much to&s;&s;ing and turning in her bed, and many &s;o|liloquies, which, if we had no better matter for our
<PB N="35" REF="023370_0034_0FBF3B5E3B167AE8">
reader, we would give him; &s;he at la&s;t rung the bell as above-mentioned, and was pre&s;ently attended by Mrs. Slip&s;lop, who was not much better plea&s;ed with Jo&s;eph than the lady her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Slip&s;lop, &s;aid lady Booby, when did you &s;ee Jo|&s;eph? the poor woman was &s;o &s;urprized at the un|expected &s;ound of his name, at &s;o critical a time, that &s;he had the greate&s;t difficulty to conceal the confu&s;ion &s;he was under, from her mi&s;tre&s;s; whom &s;he an&s;wered, neverthele&s;s, with pretty good confi|dence, though not entirely void of fear or &s;u&s;picion, that &s;he had not &s;een him that morning. <Q>I am a|fraid,</Q> &s;aid lady Booby, <Q>he is a wild young fel|low.</Q> 'That he is,' &s;aid Slip&s;lop, <Q>and a wicket one too. To my knowledge he games, drinks, &s;wears, and fights eternally: be&s;ides, he is horri|bly indicted to wenching.</Q> 'Ay!' &s;aid the lady, <Q>I never heard that of him.</Q> 'O madam,' an&s;wer|ed the other, <Q>he is &s;o lewd a ra&s;cal, that if your lady&s;hip keeps him much longer, you will not have one virgin in your hou&s;e except my&s;elf. And yet I can't conceive what the wenches &s;ee in him, to be &s;o fooli&s;hly fond as they are: in my eyes, he is as ugly a &s;carecrow as ever I upheld.</Q> 'Nay,' &s;aid the lady, 'the boy is well enough.'&mdash;<Q>La, Ma'm, cries Slip&s;lop, I think him the ragmatical|le&s;t fellow in the family.</Q> 'Sure, Slip&s;lop,' &s;ays &s;he, <Q>you are mi&s;taken: but which of the women do you &s;u&s;pect?</Q> 'Madam,' &s;ays Slip&s;lop, <Q>there is Betty the chambermaid, I am almo&s;t convict|ed, is with child by him.</Q> 'Ay!' &s;ays the lady, <Q>then pray pay her her wages in&s;tantly. I will keep no &s;uch &s;luts in my family.</Q> <Q>And as for Jo&s;eph, you may di&s;card him too.</Q> <Q>Would your lady&s;hip have him paid off immediately?</Q> cries Slip&s;lop, <Q>for perhaps, when Betty is gone, he may
<PB N="36" REF="023370_0035_0FBF3B61DA686040">
mend; and really the boy is a good &s;ervant, and a &s;trong healthy, lu&s;cious boy enough.</Q> <Q>This morning,</Q> an&s;wered the lady with &s;ome vehe|mence. 'I wi&s;h Madam,' cries Slip&s;lop, <Q>your lady&s;hip would be &s;o good as to try him a little longer.</Q> <Q>I will not have my commands di&s;put|ed,</Q> &s;aid the lady; <Q>&s;ure you are not fond of him your&s;elf.</Q> 'I Madam?' cries Slip&s;lop, reddening, if not blu&s;hing. <Q>I &s;hould be &s;orry to think your lady&s;hip had any rea&s;on to re&s;pect me of fondne&s;s for a fellow; and if it be your plea&s;ure, I &s;hall ful|fil it with as much reluctance as po&s;&s;ible.</Q> <Q>As little, I &s;uppo&s;e you mean,</Q> &s;aid the lady; <Q>and &s;o about it in&s;tantly.</Q> Mrs. Slip&s;lop went out, and the lady had &s;carce taken two turns, before &s;he fell to knocking and ringing with great violence. Slip|&s;lop, who did not travel po&s;t-ha&s;te, &s;oon returned, and was countermanded as to Jo&s;eph, but ordered to &s;end Betty about her bu&s;ine&s;s without delay. She went out a &s;econd time with much greater alacrity than before; when the lady began immediately to accu&s;e her&s;elf of want of re&s;olution, and to appre|hend the return of her affection with it's pernicious con&s;equences: &s;he therefore applied her&s;elf again to the bell, and re&s;ummoned Mrs. Slip&s;lop into her pre&s;ence; who again returned, and was told by her mi&s;tre&s;s, that &s;he had con&s;idered better of the mat|ter, and was ab&s;olutely re&s;olved to turn away Jo|&s;eph; which &s;he ordered her to do immediately. Slip&s;lop, who knew the violence of her lady's tem|per, and would not venture her place for any Ado|nis or Hercules in the univer&s;e, left her a third time; which &s;he had no &s;ooner done, than the little god Cupid, fearing he had not yet done the lady's bu|&s;ine&s;s, took a fre&s;h arrow with the &s;harpe&s;t po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> out of his quiver, and &s;hot it directly into her

heart: in other and plainer language, the lady's pa&s;&s;ion got the better of her rea&s;on. She called back Slip&s;lop once more, and told her, &s;he had re|&s;olved to &s;ee the boy, and examine him her&s;elf; therefore bid her &s;end him up. This wavering in her mi&s;tre&s;s's temper probably put &s;omething into the waiting-gentlewoman's head, not nece&s;&s;ary to mention to the &s;agacious reader.</P>
<P>Lady Booby was going to call her back again, but could not prevail with her&s;elf. The next con|&s;ideration therefore was, how &s;he &s;hould behave to Jo&s;eph when he came in. She re&s;olved to pre&s;erve all the dignity of the woman of fa&s;hion to her &s;ervant, and to indulge her&s;elf in this la&s;t view of Jo&s;eph (for that &s;he was mo&s;t certainly re|&s;olved it &s;hould be) at his own expence, by fir&s;t in&s;ulting, and then di&s;carding them.</P>
<P>O Love, what mon&s;trous tricks do&s;t thou play with thy votaries of both &s;exes! How do&s;t thou deceive them, and make them deceive them&s;elves! Their follies are thy delight! Their &s;ighs make thee laugh, and their pangs are thy merriment!</P>
<P>Not the great Rich, who turns men into mon|keys, wheelbarrows, and whatever el&s;e be&s;t hu|mours his fancy, hath &s;o &s;trangely metamorpho&s;ed the human &s;hape; nor the great Cibber, who con|founds all number, gender, and breaks thro' every rule of grammar at his will, hath &s;o di&s;torted the Engli&s;h, language, as thou do&s;t metamorpho&s;e and di&s;tort the human &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>Thou putte&s;t out our eyes, &s;toppe&s;t up our ears, and take&s;t away the power of our no&s;trils; &s;o that we can neither &s;ee the large&s;t object, hear the loude&s;t noi&s;e, nor &s;mell the mo&s;t poignant per|fume. Again, when thou plea&s;e&s;t, thou can&s;t make a mole-hill appear as a mountain; a Jew's

harp &s;ound like a trumpet, and a daizy &s;mell like a violet. Thou can&s;t make cowardice, brave, ava|rice generous, pride humble, and cruelty, tender|hearted. In &s;hort, thou turne&s;t the heart of man in&s;ide out, as a juggler doth a petticoat, and bring|e&s;t what&s;oever plea&s;eth thee out from it. If there be any one who doubts all this, let him read the next chapter.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which, after &s;ome very fine writing, the hi&s;tory goes on, and relates the interview between the lady and Jo&s;eph; where the latter hath &s;et an example, which we de&s;pair of &s;eeing followed by his &s;ex, in this vicious age.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>NOW the rake He&s;perus had called for his breeches, and having well rubbed his drow|&s;y eyes, prepared to dre&s;s him&s;elf for all night; by who&s;e example his brother rakes on earth like wi&s;e leave tho&s;e beds, in which they had &s;lept away the day. Now Thetis, the good hou&s;ewife, be|gan to put on the pot in order to regale the good man Phoebus, after his daily labours were over. In vulgar language, it was in the evening when Jo&s;eph attended his lady's orders.</P>
<P>But as it becomes us to pre&s;erve the character of this lady, who is the heroine of our tale; and, as we have naturally a wonderful tenderne&s;s for that beautiful part of the human &s;pecies, called the fair &s;ex; before we di&s;cover too much of her frail|ty to our reader, it will be proper to give him a lively idea of the va&s;t temptation, which overcame all the efforts of a mode&s;t and virtuous mind; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> then we humbly hope his good-nature will rather
<PB N="39" REF="023370_0038_0FBF3B6F4A7CA1A0">
pity than condemn the imperfection of human vir|tue.</P>
<P>Nay, the ladies them&s;elves will, we hope, be in|duced, by con&s;idering the uncommon variety of charms, which united in this young man's per&s;on, to bridle their rampant pa&s;&s;ion for cha&s;tity, and be at lea&s;t as mild as their violent mode&s;ty and virtue will permit them, in cen&s;uring the conduct of a woman, who, perhaps, was in her own di&s;po&s;iti|on as cha&s;te as tho&s;e pure and &s;anctified virgins, who, after a life innocently &s;pent in the gaieties of the town, begin about fifty to attend twice <HI>per diem</HI> at the polite churches and chapels, to return thanks for the grace which pre&s;erved them formerly among&s;t beaus, from temptations perhaps le&s;s pow|erful than what now attack the lady Booby.</P>
<P>Mr. Jo&s;eph Andrews was now in the one and twentieth year of his age. He was of the highe&s;t degree of middle &s;tature. His limbs were put to|gether with great elegance, and no le&s;s &s;trength. His legs and thighs were formed in the exacte&s;t proportion. His &s;houlders were broad and braw|ny; but yet his arms hung &s;o ea&s;ily, that he had all the &s;ymptoms of &s;trength without the lea&s;t clum|&s;ine&s;s. His hair was of a nut-brown colour, and was di&s;played in wanton ringlets down his back. His forehead was high, his eyes dark, and as full of &s;weetne&s;s as of fire. His no&s;e a little inclined to the Roman. His tee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> white and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">en. His lips full, red, and &s;oft. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">is beard was only rough on his chin and upper lip; but his cheeks, in which his blood glowed, were over&s;pread with a thick down. His countenance had a tenderne&s;s joined with a &s;en&s;ibility inexpre&s;&s;ible. Add to this the mo&s;t perfect neatne&s;s in his dre&s;s, and an air,
<PB N="40" REF="023370_0039_0FBF3B70D53002E0">
which to tho&s;e who have not &s;een many noblemen, would give an idea of nobility.</P>
<P>Such was the per&s;on who now appeared before the lady. She viewed him &s;ome time in &s;ilence, and twice or thrice before &s;he &s;pake, changed her mind as to the manner in which &s;he &s;hould begin. At length, &s;he &s;aid to him, <Q>Jo&s;eph, I am &s;orry to hear &s;uch complaints again&s;t you; I am told you behave &s;o rudely to the maids, that they cannot do their bu&s;ine&s;s in quiet; I mean tho&s;e who are not wicked enough to hearken to your &s;olicitations. As to others, they may perhaps not call you rude: for there are wicked &s;luts who make one a&s;hamed of one's own &s;ex; and are as ready to admit any nau&s;eous familiarity as fellows to offer it; nay, there are &s;uch in my family; but they &s;hall not &s;tay in it; that impudent trollop, who is with child by you, is di&s;charged by this time.</Q></P>
<P>As a per&s;on who is &s;truck through the heart with a thunderbolt, looks extremely &s;urpri&s;ed, nay, and perhaps is &s;o too&mdash;thus the poor Jo&s;eph received the fal&s;e accu&s;ation of his mi&s;tre&s;s; he blu&s;hed and looked confounded, which &s;he mi&s;interpreted to be &s;ymptoms of his guilt and thus went on:</P>
<P><Q>Come hither, Jo&s;eph: another mi&s;tre&s;s might di&s;card you for the&s;e offences; but I have com|pa&s;&s;ion for your youth, and if I could be certain you would, be no more guilty&mdash;Con&s;ider, child, (laying her hand carele&s;ly upon his) you are a hand&s;ome young fellow, and might do better; you might make your fortune.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Madam, &s;aid Jo|&s;eph, I do a&s;&s;ure your lady&s;hip, I don't know whe|ther any maid in the hou&s;e is man or woman.

cries Jo&s;eph, <Q>I hope your lady&s;hip will not be of|fended at my a&s;&s;erting my innocence: for by all that is &s;acred, I have never offered more than ki&s;|&s;ing.</Q> 'Ki&s;&s;ing!' &s;aid the lady with great di&s;|compo&s;ure of countenance, and more redne&s;s in her cheeks, than anger in her eyes, <Q>do you call that no crime? ki&s;&s;ing, Jo&s;eph, is as a prologue to a play. Can I believe a young fellow of your age and complexion will be content with ki&s;&s;ing?

</ARGUMENT>
<P><Q>SLIPSLOP, &s;aid the lady, I find too much rea&s;on to believe all thou ha&s;t told me of this wicked Jo&s;eph; I have determined to part with him in&s;tantly; &s;o go you to the &s;teward, and bid him pay him his wages.</Q> Slip&s;lop, who had pre|&s;erved hitherto a di&s;tance to her lady, rather out of nece&s;&s;ity than inclination, and who thought the knowledge of this &s;ecret had thrown down all di&s;|tinction between them, an&s;wered her mi&s;tre&s;s ve|ry pertly, <Q>She wi&s;hed &s;he knew her own mind; and that &s;he was certain &s;he would call her back again, before &s;he was got half-way down &s;tairs.</Q> The lady replied, <Q>&s;he had taken a re&s;olution, and was re&s;olved to keep it.</Q> 'I am &s;orry for it', cries Slip&s;lop; <Q>and if I had known you would have puni&s;hed the poor lad &s;o &s;everely, you &s;hould never have heard a particle of the matter.

<Q>People's ears are &s;ometimes the nice&s;t part about them.</Q></P>
<P>The lady, who began to admire the new &s;tyle in which her waiting-gentlewoman delivered her|&s;elf, and by the conclu&s;ion of her &s;peech, &s;u&s;pect|ed &s;omewhat of the truth, called her back, and de|&s;ired to know what &s;he meant by the extraordinary degree of freedom in which &s;he thought proper to indulge her tongue. 'Freedom!' &s;ays Slip&s;lop, <Q>I don't know what you call freedom! Madam; &s;ervants have tongues as well as their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es. Yes, and &s;aucy ones too, an&s;wered the lady; but I a&s;&s;ure you I &s;hall bear no &s;uch impertinence. Impertinence! I don't know that I am imper|tinent,</Q> &s;ays Slip&s;lop. 'Yes indeed you are,' cries my lady; <Q>and unle&s;s you mend your man|ners, this hou&s;e is no place for you.</Q> <Q>Man|ners!</Q> cries Slip&s;lop, <Q>I never was thought to want manners nor mode&s;ty neither; and for places, there are more places than one; and I know what I know.</Q> <Q>What do you know, mi&s;tre&s;s?</Q> an&s;wered the lady. <Q>I am not oblig|ed to tell that to every body,</Q> &s;ays Slip&s;lop, any more than I am obliged to keep it a &s;ecret.' I de&s;ire you would provide your&s;elf, an&s;wered the lady. 'With all my heart,' replied the waiting|gentlewoman; and &s;o departed in a pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;lapped the door after her.</P>
<P>The lady too plainly perceived that her waiting|gentlewoman knew more than &s;he would wil|lingly have had her acquainted with; and this &s;he imputed to Jo&s;eph's having di&s;covered to her what pa&s;&s;ed at the fir&s;t interview. This therefore blew up her rage again&s;t him, and confirmed her in a re&s;olution of parting with him.</P>
<P>But the di&s;mi&s;&s;ing Mrs. Slip&s;lop was a point not &s;o ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y to be re&s;olved upon: &s;he had the utmo&s;t,
<PB N="46" REF="023370_0045_0FBF3B7E5DB1BEE0">
tenderne&s;s for her reputation, as &s;he knew on that depended many of the mo&s;t valuable ble&s;&s;ings of life; particularly cards, making curt'&s;ies in pub|lic places, and, above all, the plea&s;ure of demoli&s;h|ing the reputations of others, in which innocent amu&s;ement &s;he had an extraordinary delight. She therefore determined to &s;ubmit to any in&s;ult from a &s;ervant, rather than run a ri&s;k of lo&s;ing the title to &s;o many great privileges.</P>
<P>She therefore &s;ent for her &s;teward, Mr. Peter Pounce; and ordered him to pay Jo&s;eph his wages, to &s;trip off his livery, and turn him out of the hou&s;e that evening.</P>
<P>She then called Slip&s;lop up, and after refre&s;hing her &s;pirits with a &s;mall cordial which &s;he kept in her clo&s;et, &s;he began in the following manner:</P>
<P><Q>Slip&s;lop, why will you, who know my pa&s;&s;i|onate temper, attempt to provoke me by your an&s;wers? I am convinced you are an hone&s;t &s;er|vant, and &s;hould be very unwilling to part with you. I believe likewi&s;e you have found me an indulgent mi&s;tre&s;s on many occa&s;ions, and have as little rea&s;on on your &s;ide to de&s;ire a change. I can't help being &s;urprized therefore, that you will take the &s;ure&s;t method to offend me: I mean repeating my words, which you know I have al|ways dete&s;ted.</Q></P>
<P>The prudent waiting-gentlewoman had duly weighed the whole matter, and found on mature deliberation, that a good place in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion was better than one in expectation. As &s;he found her mi&s;tre&s;s therefore inclined to relent, &s;he thought proper al&s;o to put on &s;ome &s;mall conde&s;cen&s;ion; which was as readily accepted: and &s;o the affair was reconciled, all offences forgiven, and a pre&s;ent of a gown and petticoat made her as an in&s;tance of her lady's future favour.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="023370_0046_0FBF3B7FCBCE4720">
She offered once or twice to &s;peak in favour of Jo|&s;eph: but found her lady's heart &s;o obdurate, that &s;he prudently dropt all &s;uch efforts. She con&s;ider|ed there were &s;ome more footmen in the hou&s;e, and &s;ome as &s;tout fellows, tho' not quite &s;o hand&s;ome as Jo&s;eph: be&s;ides, the reader hath already &s;een her ten|der advances had not met with the encouragement &s;he might have rea&s;onably expected. She thought &s;he had thrown away a great deal of &s;ack and &s;weet|meats on an ungrateful ra|&s;cal; and being a little in|clined to the opinion of that female &s;ect, who hold one lu&s;ty young fellow to be near as good as another lu&s;ty young fellow, &s;he at la&s;t gave up Jo&s;eph and his cau&s;e, and with a triumph over her pa&s;&s;ion high|ly commendable, walked off with her pre&s;ent, and with great tranquility paid a vi&s;it to a &s;tone-bottle, which is of &s;overeign u&s;e to a philo&s;ophical temper.</P>
<P>She left not her mi&s;tre&s;s &s;o ea&s;y. The poor lady could not reflect without agony, that her dear repu|tation was in the power of her &s;ervants. All her comfort, as to Jo&s;eph, was, that &s;he hoped he did not under&s;tand her meaning; at lea&s;t, &s;he could &s;ay for her&s;elf, &s;he had not plainly expre&s;s'd any thing to him; and as to Mrs. Slip&s;lop, &s;he imagined &s;he could bribe her to &s;ecrecy.</P>
<P>But what hurt her mo&s;t was, that in reality &s;he had not &s;o entirely conquered her pa&s;&s;ion; the little god lay lurking in her heart, tho' anger and di&s;dain &s;o hoodwinked her, that &s;he could not &s;ee him. She was a thou&s;and times on the very brink of revoking the &s;entence &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t the poor youth. Love became his advocate, and whi&s;pered many things in his favour. Honour likewi&s;e endeavour|ed to vindicate his crime, and pity to mitigate his puni&s;hment; on the other &s;ide, pride and revenge &s;poke as loudly again&s;t him; and thus the poor lady
<PB N="48" REF="023370_0047_0FBF3B81484DE678">
was tortured with perplexity, oppo&s;ite pa&s;&s;ions di&s;|tracting and tearing her mind different ways.</P>
<P>So I have &s;een, in the hall of We&s;tmin&s;ter, where &s;erjeant Bramble hath been retained on the right &s;ide, and &s;erjeant Puzzle on the left, the balance of opinion (&s;o equal were their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ees) alternately incline to either &s;cale. Now Bramble throws in an argu|ment, and Pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">e's &s;cale &s;trikes the beam; again, Bramble &s;hares the like fate, overpowered by the weight of Puzzle. Her Bramble hits, there Puz|zle &s;trikes; here one has you, there t'other has you, 'till at la&s;t all becomes one &s;cene of confu&s;ion in the tortured minds of the hearers; equal wagers are laid on the &s;ucce&s;s, and neither judge nor jury can po&s;&s;ibly make any thing of the matter; all things are &s;o enveloped by the careful &s;erjeants in doubt and ob&s;curity.</P>
<P>Or as it happens in the con&s;cience, where ho|nour and hone&s;ty pull one way, and a bribe and ne|ce&s;&s;ity another.&mdash;If it was our pre&s;ent bu&s;ine&s;s only to make &s;imilies, we could produce many more to this purpo&s;e: but a &s;imile (as well as a word) to the wi&s;e.

<P>HOPING you are well, what news have I to tell you!

<P>Mr. Adams hath often told me, that cha&s;tity is as great a virtue in a man as in a woman. He &s;ays he never knew any more than his wife, and I &s;hall endeavour to follow his example. Indeed, it is owing entirely to his excellent &s;ermons and advice, together with your letters, that I have been able to re&s;i&s;t a temptation, which he &s;ays no man complies with, but he repents in this world, or is damned for it in the next; and why &s;hould I tru&s;t to repentance on my death-bed, &s;ince I may die in my &s;leep?

<P>I don't doubt, dear &s;i&s;ter, but you will have grace to pre&s;erve your virtue again&s;t all trials; and I beg you earne&s;tly to pray, I may be enabled

to pre&s;erve mine; for truly it is very &s;everely at|tacked by more than one: but, I hope I &s;hall co|py your example, and that of Jo&s;eph my name|&s;ake: and maintain my virtue again&s;t all tempta|tions.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Jo&s;eph had not fini&s;hed his letter, when he was &s;ummoned down &s;tairs by Mr. Peter Pounce, to re|ceive his wages; for, be&s;ides that out of eight pounds a year he allowed his father and mother four, he had been obliged, in order to furni&s;h him&s;elf with mu|&s;ical in&s;truments, to apply to the genero&s;ity of the afore&s;aid Peter, who on urgent occa&s;ions, u&s;ed to advance the &s;ervants their wages: not before they were due, but before they were payable; that is, perhaps, half a year after they were due, and this at the moderate praemium of fifty per cent&punc; or a little more; by which charitable methods, together with lending money to other people, and even to his own ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s, the hone&s;t man had from no|thing, in a few years ama&s;&s;ed a &s;mall &s;um of twenty thou&s;and pounds or thereabouts.</P>
<P>Jo&s;eph having received his little remainder of wa|ges, and having &s;tript off his livery, was forced to borrow a frock and breeches of one of the &s;ervants: (for he was &s;o beloved in the family, that they would all have lent him any thing) and being told by Pe|ter, that he mu&s;t not &s;tay a moment longer in the hou&s;e than was nece&s;&s;ary to pack up his linen, which he ea&s;ily did in a very narrow compa&s;s; he took a very melancholy leave of his fellow-&s;ervants, and &s;et out at &s;even in the evening.</P>
<P>He had proceeded the length of two or three &s;treets, before he ab&s;olutely determined with him|&s;elf, whether he &s;hould leave the town that night, or, procuring, a lodging, wait till the morning. At la&s;t, the moon &s;hining very bright helped him to come

<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of &s;everal new matters not expected.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT is an ob&s;ervation &s;ometimes made, that to in|dicate our idea of a &s;imple fellow, we &s;ay, he is ea&s;ily to be &s;een through: Nor do I believe it a more improper denotation of a &s;imple book. In&s;tead of applying this to any particular performance, we chu&s;e rather to remark the contrary in this hi&s;tory, where the &s;cene opens it&s;elf by &s;mall degrees; and he is a &s;aga ous reader who can &s;ee two chapters before him.</P>
<P>For this rea&s;on we have not hitherto hinted a matter which now &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to be explained; &s;ince it may be wondered at, fir&s;t, that Jo&s;eph made &s;uch extraordinary ha&s;te out of town, which hath been already &s;hewn; and &s;econdly, which will be now &s;hewn, that in&s;tead of proceeding to the habitation of his father and mother, or to his beloved &s;i&s;ter Pa|mela, he cho&s;e rather to &s;et out full &s;peed to the lady Booby's country &s;eat, which he had left on his jour|ney to London.</P>
<P>Be it known then, that in the &s;ame pari&s;h where this &s;eat &s;tood, there lived a young girl whom Jo&s;eph (tho' the be&s;t of &s;ons and brothers) longed more im|patiently to &s;ee than his parents or his &s;i&s;ter. She was a poor girl, who had formerly been bred up in Sir John's family; whence, a little before the jour|ney to London, &s;he had been di&s;carded by Mrs.
<PB N="52" REF="023370_0051_0FBF3B9559D21B80">
Slip&s;lop on account of her extraordinary beauty: for I never could find any other rea&s;on.</P>
<P>This young creature (who now lived with a far|mer in the pari&s;h) had been always beloved by Jo|&s;eph, and returned his affection. She was two years only younger than our hero. They had been ac|quainted from their infancy, and had conceived a very early liking for each other, which had grown to &s;uch a degree of affection, that Mr. Adams had with much ado prevented them from marrying, and per&s;uaded them to wait, till a few years &s;ervice and thrift had a little improved their experience, and en|abled them to live comfortably together.</P>
<P>They followed this good man's advice, as indeed his word was little le&s;s than a law in his pari&s;h; for as he had &s;hewn his pari&s;honers by an uniform be|haviour of thirty-five years duration, that he had their good entirely at heart; &s;o they con&s;ulted him on every occa&s;ion, and very &s;eldom acted contrary to his opinion.</P>
<P>Nothing can be imagined more tender than was the parting between the&s;e two lovers. A thou&s;and &s;ighs heaved the bo&s;om of Jo&s;eph; a thou&s;and tears di&s;tilled from the lovely eyes of Fanny, (for that was her name) tho' her mode&s;ty would only &s;uffer her to admit his eager ki&s;&s;es, her violent love made her more than pa&s;&s;ive in his embraces; and &s;he often pulled him to her brea&s;t with a &s;oft pre&s;&s;ure, which tho' perhaps it would not have &s;queezed an in&s;ect to death, cau&s;ed more emotion in the heart of Jo|&s;eph, than the clo&s;e&s;t Corni&s;h hug could have done.</P>
<P>The reader may perhaps wonder, that &s;o fond a pair &s;hould during a twelvemonth's ab&s;ence never conver&s;e with one another; indeed there was but one rea&s;on which did, or could have prevented them; and this was, that poor Fanny could neither

<P>They contented them&s;elves therefore with fre|quent enquiries after each other's health, with a mutual confidence in each other's fidelity, and the pro&s;pect of their future happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Having explained the&s;e matters to our reader, and, as far as po&s;&s;ible, &s;atisfied all his doubts, we return to hone&s;t Jo&s;eph, whom we left ju&s;t &s;et out on his travels by the light of the moon.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have read any romance or poetry an|tient or modern, mu&s;t have been informed, that love hath wings; by which they are not to under&s;tand, as &s;ome young ladies by mi&s;take have done, that a lover can fly; the writers, by this ingenious allego|ry, intended to in&s;inuate no more, than that lovers do not march like hor&s;e-guards; in &s;hort, that they put the be&s;t leg foremo&s;t; which our lu&s;ty youth, who could walk with any man, did &s;o heartily on this occa&s;ion, that within four hours, he reached a famous hou&s;e of ho&s;pitality well known to the we&s;t|ern traveller. It pre&s;ents you a lion on a &s;ign-po&s;t: and the ma&s;ter, who was chri&s;tened Timotheus, is commonly called plain Tim. Some hath conceived that he hath particularly cho&s;en the lion for his &s;ign, as he doth in countenance greatly re&s;emble that mag|nanimous bea&s;t, tho' his di&s;po&s;ition favours more of the &s;weetne&s;s of the lamb. He is a per&s;on well re|ceived among all &s;orts of men, being qualified to render him&s;elf agreeable to any; as he is well ver|&s;ed in hi&s;tory and politicks, hath a &s;mattering in law and divinity, cracks a good je&s;t, and plays won|derfully well on the French horn.</P>
<P>A violent &s;torm of hail forced Jo&s;eph to take &s;hel|ter in this inn, where he remembered Sir Thomas
<PB N="54" REF="023370_0053_0FBF3B988C574188">
had dined in his way to town. Jo&s;eph had no &s;oon|er &s;eated him&s;elf by the kitchen fire, than Timothe|us, ob&s;erving his livery, began to condole the lo&s;s of his late ma&s;ter; who was, he &s;aid, his very parti|cular and intimate acquaintance, with whom he had cracked many a merry bottle, aye many a dozen in his time. He then remarked, that all tho&s;e things were over now, all pa&s;t, and ju&s;t as if they had never been; and concluded with an excellent ob&s;ervation on the certainty of death, which his wife &s;aid was indeed very true. A fellow now arrived at the &s;ame inn with two hor&s;es, one of which he was leading farther down into the country to meet his ma&s;ter; the&s;e he put into the &s;table, and came and took his place by Jo&s;eph's &s;ide, who immediately knew him to be the &s;ervant of a neighbouring gentleman, who u&s;ed to vi&s;it at their hou&s;e.</P>
<P>This fellow was likewi&s;e forced in by the &s;torm; for he had orders to go twenty miles farther that evening, and luckily on the &s;ame road which Jo|&s;eph him&s;elf intended to take. He therefore em|braced this opportunity of complimenting his friend with his ma&s;ter's hor&s;es, (notwith&s;tanding he had received expre&s;s commands to the contra|ry) which was readily accepted, and &s;o after they had drank a loving pot, and the &s;torm was over, they &s;et out together.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>NOTHING remarkable happened on the road, till their arrival at the inn to which the hor|&s;es
<PB N="55" REF="023370_0054_0FBF3B9A164F0770">
were ordered; whither they came about two in the morning. The moon then &s;hone very bright; and Jo&s;eph making his friend a pre&s;ent of a pint of wine, and thanking him for the favour of his hor&s;e, notwith&s;tanding all entreaties to the contrary, proceeded on his journey on foot.</P>
<P>He had not gone above two miles, charmed with the hopes of &s;hortly &s;eeing his beloved Fanny, when he was met by two fellows in a narrow lane, and ordered to &s;tand and deliver. He readily gave them all the money he had, which was &s;omewhat le&s;s than two pounds; and told them he hoped they would be &s;o generous as to return him a few &s;hil|lings, to defray his charges on his way home.</P>
<P>One of the ruffians an&s;wered with an oath, yes, we'll give you &s;omething pre&s;ently: but fir&s;t &s;trip and be d&mdash;n'd to you.&mdash;Strip, cry'd the other, or I'll blow your brains to the devil. Jo&s;eph re|membering that he had borrowed his coat and breeches of a friend, and that he &s;hould be a&s;ham|ed of making any excu&s;e for not returning them, replied, he hoped they would not in&s;i&s;t on his cloaths, which were not worth much, but con&s;ider the coldne&s;s of the night. You are cold, are you, you ra&s;cal! &s;ays one of the robbers, I'll warm you with a vengeance; and damning his eyes, &s;napt a pi&s;|tol at his head: which he had no &s;ooner done, than the other levelled a blow at him with his &s;tick, which Jo&s;eph, who was expert at cudgel-playing, caught with his, and returned the favour &s;o &s;uc|ce&s;sfully on his adver&s;ary, that he laid him &s;praw|ling at his feet, and at the &s;ame in&s;tant received a blow from behind, with the but-end of a pi&s;tol from the other villain, which felled him to the ground, and totally deprived him of his &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>The thief, who had been knocked down, had
<PB N="56" REF="023370_0055_0FBF3B9C4ED60110">
now recovered him&s;elf; and both together fell to belabouring poor Jo&s;eph with their &s;ticks, till they were convinced they had put an end <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o his mi&s;era|ble being: They then &s;tript him entirely naked, threw him into a ditch, and departed with their booty.</P>
<P>The poor wretch, who lay motionle&s;s a long time, ju&s;t began to recover his &s;en&s;es as a &s;tage|coach came by. The po&s;tilion hearing a man's groans, &s;topt his hor&s;es, and told the coachman, he was certain there was a dead man lying in the ditch; for he heard him groan. 'Go on, &s;irrah,' &s;ays the coachman, <Q>we are confounded late, and have no time to look after dead men.</Q> A lady, who heard what the po&s;tilion &s;aid, and like|wi&s;e heard the groan, called eagerly to the coach|man, to &s;top and &s;ee what was the matter. Upon which he bid the po&s;tilion alight, and look into the ditch. He did &s;o, and returned, <Q>That there was a man &s;itting upright as naked as ever he was born.&mdash;O J&mdash;&s;us,</Q> cry'd the lady, <Q>A naked man! Dear coachman, drive on and leave him.</Q> Upon this the gentlemen got out of the coach; and Jo&s;eph begged them to have mercy upon him: For that he had been robbed, and almo&s;t beaten to death. 'Robbed,' cries an old gentleman; <Q>Let us make all the ha&s;te imaginable, or we &s;hall be robbed too.</Q> A young man who belonged to the law an&s;wered, <Q>He wi&s;hed they had pa&s;&s;ed by with|out taking any notice; but that now they might be proved to have been la&s;t in his company; if he &s;hould die, they might be called to &s;ome ac|count for his murder. He therefore thought it advi&s;able to &s;ave the poor creature's life, for their own &s;akes, if po&s;&s;ible; at lea&s;t, if he died, to prevent the jury's finding that they fled for it.
<PB N="57" REF="023370_0056_0FBF3BA0F1CA0C48">
He was therefore of opinion, to take the man in|to the coach, and carry him to the next inn.</Q> The lady in&s;i&s;ted, <Q>That he &s;hould not come into the coach. That if they lifted him in, &s;he would her&s;elf alight: for &s;he had rather &s;tay in that place to all eternity, than ride with a naked man.</Q> The coachman objected, <Q>That he could not &s;uf|fer him to be taken in, unle&s;s &s;omebody would pay a &s;hilling for his carriage the four miles.</Q> which the two gentlemen refu&s;ed to do. But the lawyer, who was afraid of &s;ome mi&s;chief happen|ing to him&s;elf if the wretch was left behind in that condition, &s;aying, no man could be too cauti|ous in the&s;e matters, and that he remembered very extraordinary ca&s;es in the books, threatened the coachman, and bid him deny taking him up at his peril; for that if he died, he &s;hould be indicted for his murder; and if he lived, and brought an acti|on again&s;t him, he would willingly take a brief in it. The&s;e words had a &s;en&s;ible effect on the coach|man, who was well acquainted with the per&s;on who &s;poke them; and the old gentleman above|mentioned, thinking the naked man would afford him frequent opportunities of &s;hewing his wit to the lady, offered to join with the company in giv|ing a mug of beer for his fare; till partly alarmed by the threats of the one, and partly by the pro|mi&s;es of the other, and being, perhaps, a little moved with compa&s;&s;ion at the poor creature's con|dition, who &s;tood bleeding and &s;hivering with the cold, he at length agreed; and Jo&s;eph was now advancing to the coach, where, &s;eeing the lady, who held the &s;ticks of her fan before her eyes, he ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed, mi&s;erable as he was, to enter, unle&s;s he was furni&s;hed with &s;ufficient covering, to prevent giving the lea&s;t offence to decency. So
<PB N="58" REF="023370_0057_0FBF3BA2EE838438">
perfectly mode&s;t was this young man; &s;uch migh|ty effects had the &s;potle&s;s example of the amiable Pamela, and the excellent &s;ermons of Mr. Adams, wrought upon him.</P>
<P>Though there were &s;everal great coats about the coach, it was not ea&s;y to get over the difficulty which Jo&s;eph had &s;tarted. The two gentlemen complained they were cold, and could not &s;pare a rag; the man of wit &s;aying, with a laugh, that charity began at home; and the coachman, who had two great coats &s;pread under him, refu&s;ed to lend either, le&s;t they &s;hould be made bloody; the lady's footman de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed for the &s;ame rea&s;on, which the lady her&s;elf, notwith&s;tanding her abhorrence of a naked man, approved; and it is more than probable, poor Jo&s;eph, who ob&s;tinate|ly adhered to his mode&s;t re&s;olution, mu&s;t have pe|ri&s;hed, unle&s;s the po&s;tilion, (a lad who hath been &s;ince tran&s;ported for robbing a henroo&s;t) had vo|luntarily &s;tript off a great coat, his only garment, at the &s;ame time &s;wearing a great oath (for which he was rebuked by the pa&s;&s;engers) <Q>That he would rather ride in his &s;hirt all his life, than &s;uffer a fel|low-creature to lie in &s;o mi&s;erable a condition.</Q></P>
<P>Jo&s;eph, having put on the great coat, was lifted into the coach, which now proceeded on its jour|ney. He declared him&s;elf almo&s;t dead with the cold, which gave the man of wit an occa&s;ion to a&s;k the lady, if &s;he could not accommodate him with a dram. She an&s;wered with &s;ome re&s;ent|ment, <Q>She wondered at his a&s;king her &s;uch a que&s;tion; but a&s;&s;ured him &s;he never ta&s;ted any &s;uch thing.</Q></P>
<P>The lawyer was enquiring into the circum&s;tan|ces of the robbery, when the coach &s;topt, and one of the ruffians putting a pi&s;tol in, demanded their
<PB N="59" REF="023370_0058_0FBF3BA3C6D8E630">
money of the pa&s;&s;engers; who readily gave it them; and the lady, in her fright, delivered up a little &s;ilver bottle, of about a half pint &s;ize, which the rogue, clapping it to his mouth, and drinking her health, declared it held &s;ome of the be&s;t Nan|tes he had ever ta&s;ted: this the lady afterwards a&s;&s;ured the company was the mi&s;take of her maid; for that &s;he had ordered her to fill the bottle with Hungary-water.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the fellows were departed, the law|yer, who had, it &s;eems, a ca&s;e of pi&s;tols in the &s;eat of the coach, informed the company, that if it had been day-light, and he could have come at his pi&s;tols, he would not have &s;ubmitted to the robbe|ry; he likewi&s;e &s;et forth, that he had often met highwaymen when he travelled on hor&s;eback, but none ever dur&s;t attack him; concluding, that if he had not been more afraid for the lady than for him&s;elf, he &s;hould not have now parted with his money &s;o ea&s;ily.</P>
<P>As wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> is generally ob&s;erved to love to re&s;ide in empty pockets, &s;o the gentleman, who&s;e ingenuity we have above remarked, as &s;oon as he had parted with his money, began to grow wonderfully face|tious. He made frequent allu&s;ions to Adam and Eve, and &s;aid many excellent things on figs, and fig-leaves; which, perhaps, gave more offence to Jo&s;eph than to any other in the company.</P>
<P>The lawyer likewi&s;e made &s;everal very pretty je&s;ts, without departing from his profe&s;&s;ion, He &s;aid, <Q>If Jo&s;eph and the lady were alone, he would be more capable of making a conveyance to her, as his affairs were not fettered with any incum|brance; he'd warrant, he &s;oon &s;uffered a recove|ry by a writ of entry, which was the proper way to create heirs in tail; that for his own part, he
<PB N="60" REF="023370_0059_0FBF3BA7962520E0">
would engage to make &s;o firm a &s;ettlement in a coach, that there &s;hould be no danger of an eject|ment;</Q> with an inundation of the like gibberi&s;h, which he continued to vent till the coach arrived at an inn, where one &s;ervant-maid only was up in readine&s;s to attend the coachman, and furni&s;h him with cold meat and a dram. Jo&s;eph de&s;ired to alight, and that he might have a bed prepared for him, which the maid readily promi&s;ed to perform; and being a good-natured wench, and not &s;o &s;que|mi&s;h as the lady had been, &s;he clapt a large faggot on the fire, and furni&s;hing Jo&s;eph with a great coat belonging to one of the ho&s;tlers, de&s;ired him to &s;it down and warm him&s;elf, whil&s;t &s;he made his bed. The coachman, in the mean time, took an opportunity to call up a &s;urgeon, who lived within a few doors: after which, he reminded his pa&s;|&s;engers how late they were, and after they had ta|ken leave of Jo&s;eph, hurried them off as fa&s;t as he could.</P>
<P>The wench &s;oon got Jo&s;eph to bed, and promi&s;ed to u&s;e her intere&s;t to borrow him a &s;hirt; but ima|gined, as &s;he afterwards &s;aid, by his being &s;o bloo|dy, that he mu&s;t be a dead man: &s;he ran with all &s;peed to ha&s;ten the &s;urgeon, who was more than half dre&s;t, apprehending that the coach had been overturned and &s;ome gentleman or lady hurt. As &s;oon as the wench had informed him at his win|dow, that it was a poor foot-pa&s;&s;enger who had been &s;tript of all he had, and almo&s;t murdered; he chid her for di&s;turbing him &s;o early, &s;lipped off his clothes again, and very quietly returned to bed and to &s;leep.</P>
<P>Aurora now began to &s;how her blooming cheeks over the hills, whil&s;t ten millions of feathered &s;ong&s;ters, in jocund chorus, repeated, odes a thou|&s;and

times &s;weeter than tho&s;e of our laureat, and &s;ung both the day and the &s;ong; when the ma&s;ter of the inn, Mr. Tow-wou&s;e, aro&s;e, and learning from his maid an account of the robbery, and the &s;ituation of his poor naked gue&s;t, he &s;hook his head, and cried, good lack-a-day! and then ordered the girl to carry him one of his own &s;hirts.</P>
<P>Mrs. Tow-wou&s;e was ju&s;t awake, and had &s;tretch|ed out her arms in vain to fold her departed hu&s;|band, when the maid entered the room. <Q>Who's there? Betty?</Q> 'Yes, Madam.' <Q>Where's your ma&s;ter?</Q> <Q>He's without, Madam; he hath &s;ent me for a &s;hirt to lend a poor naked man, who hath been robbed and murdered.</Q> <Q>Touch one, if you dare, you &s;lut,</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Tow-wou&s;e; <Q>your ma&s;ter is a pretty &s;ort of a man to take in naked vagabonds, and clothe them with his own clothes. I &s;hall have no &s;uch doings.&mdash;If you offer to touch any thing, I'll throw the chamber-pot at your head. Go, &s;end your ma&s;ter to me,</Q> 'Yes, Madam,' an&s;wered Betty. As &s;oon as he came in, &s;he thus began: <Q>What the devil do you mean by this, Mr. Tow-wou&s;e? Am I to buy &s;hirts to lend to a &s;et of &s;cabby ra&s;cals?</Q> <Q>My dear, &s;aid Mr. Tow|wou&s;e this is a poor wretch.</Q> 'Yes' &s;ays &s;he, <Q>I know, it is a poor wretch; but what the devil have we to do with poor wretches? the law makes us provide for too many already. We &s;hall have thirty or forty poor wretches in red coats &s;hortly.</Q> 'My dear,' cries Tow-wou&s;e, this man hath been robbed of all he hath' Well then,' &s;ays &s;he, <Q>where's his money to pay his reckoning? Why doth not &s;uch a fellow go to an ale-hou&s;e? I &s;hall &s;end him packing as &s;oon as I am up, I a&s;&s;ure you.</Q> My dear &s;aid he, 'common charity won't &s;uffer you to do that.'

<P>With &s;uch like di&s;cour&s;es they con&s;umed near half an hour, whil&s;t Betty provided a &s;hirt from the ho&s;tler, who was one of her &s;weethearts, and put it on poor Jo&s;eph.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>What happened to Jo&s;eph during his &s;ickne&s;s at the inn, with the curious di&s;cour&s;e between him and Mr. Barnabas the par&s;on of the pari&s;h.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AS &s;oon as Jo&s;eph had communicated a parti|cular hi&s;tory of the robbery, together with a &s;hort account of him&s;elf and his intended journey, he a&s;ked the &s;urgeon, if he apprehended him to be in any danger: To which the &s;urgeon very hone&s;t|ly an&s;wered, <Q>He feared he was; for that his pul&s;e was very exalted and feveri&s;h, and if his fever &s;hould prove more than &s;ymptomatic, it would be impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ave him.</Q> Jo&s;eph fetch|ing a deep &s;igh, cried, <Q>Poor Fanny, I would I could have lived to &s;ee thee! but God's will be done.</Q></P>
<P>The &s;urgeon then advi&s;ed him, if he had any worldly affairs to &s;ettle, that he would do it as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; for tho' he hoped he might recover, yet he thought him&s;elf obliged to acquaint him he was in great danger; and if the malign concoction of his humours &s;hould cau&s;e a &s;u&s;citation of his fe|ver, he might &s;oon grow delirious and incapable to make his will. Jo&s;eph an&s;wered, <Q>That it was impo&s;&s;ible for any creature in the univer&s;e to be in a poorer condition than him&s;elf: for &s;ince the robbery, he had not one thing of any kind whatever, which he could call his own. I had, &s;aid he, a poor little piece of gold, which they took away, that would have been a comfort to me in all my afflictions; but &s;urely, Fanny, I want nothing to remind me of thee. I have
<PB N="64" REF="023370_0063_0FBF3BAF132A8E20">
thy dear image in my heart, and no villain can ever tear it thence.</Q></P>
<P>Jo&s;eph de&s;ired paper and pens to write a letter, but they were refu&s;ed him; and he was advi&s;ed to u&s;e all his endeavours to compo&s;e him&s;elf. They then left him; and Mr. Tow-wou&s;e &s;ent to a cler|gyman to come and admini&s;ter his good offices to the &s;oul of poor Jo&s;eph, &s;ince the &s;urgeon de&s;paired of making any &s;ucce&s;sful applications to his body.</P>
<P>Mr. Barnabas (for that was the clergyman's name) came as &s;oon as &s;ent for; and having fir&s;t drank a di&s;h of tea with the landlady, and afterwards a bowl of punch with the landlord, he walked up to the room where Jo&s;eph lay; but finding him a&s;leep, re|turned to take the other &s;na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">er; which when he had fini&s;hed, he again crept &s;oftly up to the cham|ber-door, and having opened it, heard the &s;ick man talking to him&s;elf in the following manner:</P>
<P><Q>O mo&s;t adorable Pamela! mo&s;t virtuous &s;i&s;ter! who&s;e example could alone enable me to with&s;tand all the temptations of riches and beauty, and to pre&s;erve my virtue pure and cha&s;te, for the arms of my dear Fanny, if it had plea&s;ed heaven that I &s;hould ever have come unto them. What riches, or honours, or plea&s;ures can make us amends for the lo&s;s of innocence? Doth not that alone afford us more con&s;olation, than all worldly acqui&s;itions? What but innocence and virtue could give any comfort to &s;uch a mi&s;erable wretch as I am? Yet the&s;e can make me prefer this &s;ick and painful bed to all the plea&s;ures I &s;hould have found in my la|dy's. The&s;e can make me face death without fear; and though I love my Fanny more than ever man loved a woman, the&s;e can teach me to re&s;ign my|&s;elf to the divine will without repining. O thou delightful charming creature! if heaven had in|dulged
<PB N="65" REF="023370_0064_0FBF3BB29787ED00">
thee to my arms, the poore&s;t, humble&s;t &s;tate, would have been a paradi&s;e; I could have lived with thee in the lowe&s;t cottage, without en|vying the palaces, the dainties, or the riches of any man breathing. But I mu&s;t leave thee, leave thee for ever, my deare&s;t angel! I mu&s;t think of another world; and I heartily pray thou may'&s;t meet com|fort in this.</Q>&mdash;Barnabas thought he had heard e|nough; &s;o down &s;tairs he went and told Tow-wou&s;e he could do his gue&s;t no &s;ervice; for that he was very light-headed, and had uttered nothing but a rhap&s;ody of non&s;en&s;e all the time he &s;tayed in the room.</P>
<P>The &s;urgeon returned in the afternoon, and found his patient in a higher fever, as he &s;aid, than when he left him, though not delirious; for not|with&s;tanding Mr. Barnabas's opinion, he had not been once out of his &s;en&s;es &s;ince his arrival at the inn.</P>
<P>Mr. Barnabas was again &s;ent for, and with much difficulty prevailed on to make another vi&s;it. As &s;oon as he entered the room, he told Jo&s;eph, <Q>He was come to pray by him, and to prepare him for another world: in the fir&s;t place therefore, he hoped he had repented of all his &s;ins.</Q> Jo&s;eph an|&s;wered, <Q>He hoped he had; but there was one thing which he knew not whether he &s;hould call a &s;in; if it was, he feared he &s;hould die in the commi&s;&s;ion of it; and that was the regret of parting with a young woman, whom he loved as tenderly as he did his heart &s;trings.</Q> Barnabas bad him be a&s;|&s;ured, <Q>that any repining at the divine will was one of the greate&s;t &s;ins he could commit; that he ought to forget all carnal affections, and think of better things.</Q> Jo&s;eph &s;aid, <Q>That neither in this world nor the next, he could forget his Fanny; and that
<PB N="66" REF="023370_0065_0FBF3BB50345B908">
the thought, however grievous, of parting from her for ever, was not half &s;o tormenting, as the fear of what &s;he &s;hould &s;uffer, when &s;he knew his misfor|tune.</Q> Barnabas &s;aid, <Q>That &s;uch fears argued a diffidence and de&s;pondence very criminal; that he mu&s;t dive&s;t him&s;elf of all human pa&s;&s;ions, and fix his heart above.</Q> Jo&s;eph an&s;wered, <Q>That was what he de&s;ired to do.</Q> He then que&s;tioned him concerning his forgivene&s;s of the thieves.&mdash;Jo&s;eph, with a very heavy &s;igh, replied, He feared <Q>that was more than he could do: for nothing would give him more plea&s;ure than to hear they were taken.</Q> 'That,' cries Barnabas, <Q>is for the &s;ake of Ju&s;tice.</Q> 'Yes,' &s;aid Jo&s;eph, <Q>but if I was to meet them again, I am afraid I &s;hould at|tack them, and kill them too, if I could.</Q> 'Doubt|le&s;s an&s;wered Barnabas, <Q>it is lawful to kill a thief: but can you forgive them as a chri&s;tian ought?</Q> Jo&s;eph de&s;ired to know what that forgive|ne&s;s was.

Well, well, &s;aid Barnabas, 'that will do.' He then demanded of him, <Q>if he remembered any more &s;ins unrepented of; and if he did, he de&s;ired him to make ha&s;te and repent of them as fa&s;t as he could: that they might repeat over a few prayers together.</Q> Jo&s;eph an&s;wered, <Q>He could not recol|lect any great crimes he had been guilty of, and that tho&s;e he had committed he was &s;incerely &s;orry for.</Q> Barnabas &s;aid that was enough, and then proceeded to prayer with all the expedition he was ma&s;ter of, &s;ome company then waiting for him be|low i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the parlour, where the ingredients for punch were all in readine&s;s; but no one would &s;queeze the oranges till he came.</P>

Jo&s;eph complained he was dry, and de&s;ired a lit|tle tea; which Barnabas reported to Mrs. Tow|wou&s;e, who an&s;wered, <Q>She had ju&s;t done drinking it, and could not bear to be &s;lopping all day;</Q> but ordered Betty to carry him up &s;ome &s;mall beer.</P>
<P>Betty obeyed her mi&s;tre&s;s's commands; but Jo|&s;eph, as &s;oon as he ta&s;ted it, &s;aid, he feared it would increa&s;e his fever, and that he longed very much for tea: To which the good-natured Betty an&s;wered, he &s;hould have tea, if there was any in the land; &s;he accordingly went and bought him &s;ome her&s;elf, and attended him with it: where we will leave her and Jo&s;eph together for &s;ome time, to entertain the reader with other matters.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Being very full of adventures, which &s;ucceeded each other at the inn.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT was now the du&s;k of the evening, when a grave per&s;on rode into the inn, and committing his hor&s;e to the ho&s;tler, went directly into the kitchen, and having called for a pipe of tobacco, took his place by the fire-&s;ide; where &s;everal per&s;ons were likewi&s;e a&s;&s;embled.</P>
<P>The di&s;cour&s;e ran altogether on the robbery which was committed the night before, and on the poor wretch, who lay above in the dreadful conditi|on in which we have already &s;een him. Mrs. Tow|wou&s;e &s;aid, <Q>She wondered what the devil Tom Whipwell meant by bringing &s;uch gue&s;ts to her hou&s;e, when there were &s;o many ale hou&s;es on the road proper for their reception. But &s;he a&s;&s;ured him, if he died, the pari&s;h &s;hould be at the expence of the funeral.</Q> She added, <Q>Nothing would &s;erve the fellow's turn but tea, &s;he would a&s;&s;ure him.</Q> Betty, who was ju&s;t returned from her charitable of|fice,
<PB N="68" REF="023370_0067_0FBF3BC264420738">
an&s;wered, &s;he believed he was a gentleman, for &s;he never &s;aw a finer &s;kin in her life. <Q>Pox on his &s;kin!</Q> replied Mrs. Tow-wou&s;e, <Q>I &s;uppo&s;e that is all we are like to have for the reckoning. I de|&s;ire no &s;uch gentlemen &s;hould ever call at the Dra|gon,</Q> (which it &s;eems was the &s;ign of the inn.)</P>
<P>The gentleman lately arrived di&s;covered a great deal of emotion at the di&s;tre&s;s of this poor creature, whom he ob&s;erved to be fallen not into the mo&s;t com|pa&s;&s;ionate hands. And indeed, if Mrs. Tow-wou&s;e had given no utterance to the &s;weetne&s;s of her tem|per, nature had taken &s;uch pains in her counte|nance, that Hogarth him&s;elf never gave more ex|pre&s;&s;ion to a picture.</P>
<P>Her per&s;on was &s;hort, thin, and crooked. Her forehead projected in the middle, and thence de|&s;cended in a declivity to the top of her no&s;e, which was &s;harp and red, and would have hung over her lips, had not nature turned up one end of it. Her lips were two bits of &s;kin, which, whenever &s;he &s;poke, &s;he drew together in a pur&s;e. Her chin was peaked; and at the upper end of that &s;kin, which compo&s;ed her cheeks, &s;tood two bones, that almo&s;t hid a pair of &s;mall red eyes. Add to this a voice mo&s;t wonderfully adapted to the &s;entiments it was to convey, being both loud and hoar&s;e.</P>
<P>It is not ea&s;y to &s;ay, whether the gentleman had conceived a greater di&s;like for his landlady, or compa&s;&s;ion for her unhappy gue&s;t. He enquir|ed very earne&s;tly of the &s;urgeon, who was now come into the kitchen, whether he had any hopes of his recovery? he begged him to u&s;e all po&s;&s;ible means towards it, telling him, <Q>it was the duty of men of all profe&s;&s;ions, to apply their &s;kill gratis for the relief of the poor and nece&s;&s;itous.</Q> The &s;urgeon an&s;wered, <Q>he &s;hould take proper care;
<PB N="69" REF="023370_0068_0FBF3BC39C4B4940">
but he defied all the &s;urgeons in London to do him any good.</Q> 'Pray, Sir,' &s;aid the gentle|man, 'What are his wounds?&mdash;Why, <Q>do you know any thing of wounds?</Q> &s;ays the &s;urgeon (winking upon Mrs. Tow-wou&s;e) <Q>Sir, I have a &s;mall &s;mattering in &s;urgery,</Q> an&s;wered the gen|man. 'A &s;mattering,&mdash;ho, ho, ho!' &s;aid the &s;ur|geon, 'I believe it is a &s;mattering indeed.</P>
<P>The company were all attentive, expecting to hear the doctor, who was what they call a dry fel|low, expo&s;e the gentleman.</P>
<P>He began therefore with an air of triumph: <Q>I &s;uppo&s;e, Sir, you have travelled.</Q> <Q>No really Sir,</Q> &s;aid the gentleman. <Q>Ho! then you have practi&s;ed in the ho&s;pitals perhaps.</Q>&mdash;'No, Sir,' <Q>Hum! not that neither? Whence, Sir, then, if I may be &s;o bold to enquire, have you got your knowledge in &s;urgery?</Q> 'Sir', an&s;wered the gen|man, <Q>I do not pretend to much; but the little I know, I have from books.</Q> 'Book!' cries the doctor.&mdash;'What, I &s;uppo&s;e you have read Galen and Hippocrates!' 'No, Sir, &s;aid the gentleman. 'How! you under&s;tand &s;urgery,' an&s;wers the doc|tor, 'and not read Galen and Hippocrates' 'Sir,' cries the other, <Q>I believe there are many &s;urgeons who have never read the&s;e authors.</Q> <Q>I believe &s;o too,</Q> &s;ays the doctor, <Q>more &s;hame for them: but thanks to my education I have them by heart, and very &s;eldom go without them both in my pocket.</Q> 'They are pretty large books, '&s;aid the gentleman. 'Aye,' &s;aid the doctor, <Q>I believe I know how large they are better than you.</Q> (At which he fell a winking, and the whole compa|ny bur&s;t into a laugh.)</P>
<P>The doctor pur&s;uing his triumph, a&s;ked the gentleman, <Q>if he did not under&s;tand phy&s;ic as well
<PB N="70" REF="023370_0069_0FBF3BC5A49B8178">
as &s;urgery.</Q> 'Rather better,' an&s;wered the gen|tleman. 'Aye, like enough,' cries the doctor, with a wink. 'Why, I know a little of phy&s;ic too.' I wi&s;h I knew half &s;o much,' &s;aid Tow-wou&s;e, I'd never wear an apron again.' <Q>Why I be|lieve, landlord,</Q> cries the doctor, <Q>there are few men, though I &s;ay it, within twelve miles of the place, that handle a fever better.&mdash;<HI>Veniente ac|currite merbo:</HI> that is my method.&mdash;I &s;uppo&s;e, brother, you under&s;tand <HI>Latin?</HI> A little,</Q> &s;ays the gentleman. <Q>Aye, and Greek now I'll warrant you: <HI>Ton dapomibo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">inos poluflo&s;hoio Thala&s;&s;es.</HI> But I have almo&s;t forgot the&s;e things, I could have repeated Homer by heart once.</Q>&mdash;<Q>I&s;ags! the gentleman has caught a Traytor,</Q> &s;ays Mrs. Tow-wou&s;e; at which they all fell a laughing.</P>
<P>The gentleman, who had not the lea&s;t affection for joking, very contentedly &s;uffered the doctor to enjoy his victory; which he did with no &s;mall &s;a|tisfaction: and having &s;ufficiently &s;ounded his depth, told him, <Q>he was thoroughly convinced of his great abilities; and that he would be obliged to him, if he would let him know his opinion of his patient's ca&s;e above &s;tairs.</Q> 'Sir,' &s;ays the doctor, <Q>his ca&s;e is that of a dead man&mdash;The contu&s;ion on his head has perforated the in|ternal membrane of the occiput, and divelicated that radical &s;mall minute invi&s;ible nerve, which coheres to the pericranium; and this was an|tended with a fever at fir&s;t &s;ymptomatic, then pneumatic; and he is at length grown deliriuus, or delirious as the vulgar expre&s;s it.</Q></P>
<P>He was proceeding in this learned manner, when a mighty noi&s;e interrupted him. Some young fel|lows in the neighbourhood had taken one of the thieves, and were bringing him into the inn. Bet|ty
<PB N="71" REF="023370_0070_0FBF3BC714C52F38">
ran up &s;tairs with this news to Jo&s;eph: who begged they might &s;earch for a little piece of bro|ken gold, which had a ribband tied to it, and which he could &s;wear to among&s;t all the hoards of the riche&s;t men in the univer&s;e.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the fellow's per&s;i&s;ting in his innocence, the mob were very bu&s;y in &s;earching him, and pre&s;ently, among other things, pulled out the piece of gold ju&s;t mentioned; which Betty no &s;ooner &s;aw, than &s;he laid violent hands on it, and conveyed it up to Jo&s;eph, who received it with rap|tures of joy, and hugging it in his bo&s;om, declared, he could now die contented.</P>
<P>Within a few minutes afterwards, came in &s;ome other fellows, with a bundle which they had found in a ditch, and which was indeed the cloaths which had been &s;tripped off from Jo&s;eph, and the other things they had taken from him.</P>
<P>The gentleman no &s;ooner &s;aw the coat, than he declared he knew the livery; and, if it had been taken from the poor creature above &s;tairs, de&s;ired he might &s;ee him: for that he was very well ac|quainted with the family to whom that livery be|longed.</P>
<P>He was accordingly conducted up by Betty: but what, reader, was the &s;urprize on both &s;ides, when he &s;aw Jo&s;eph was the per&s;on in bed; and when Jo&s;eph di&s;covered the face of his good friend Mr. Abraham Adams!</P>
<P>It would be impertinent to in&s;ert a di&s;cour&s;e which chiefly turned on the relation of matters al|ready well known to the reader: for as &s;oon as the curate had &s;atisfied Jo&s;eph concerning the perfect health of his Fanny, he was on his &s;ide very inqui|&s;itive into all the particulars which had produced this unfortunate accident.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="023370_0071_0FBF3BC88A86B3C0">
To return therefore to the kitchen, where a great variety of company were now a&s;&s;embled from all the rooms of the hou&s;e, as well as the neighbourhood: &s;o much delight do men take in contemplating the countenance of a thief.</P>
<P>Mr. Tow-wou&s;e began to rub his hands with plea&s;ure, at &s;eeing &s;o large an a&s;&s;embly; who would he hoped, &s;hortly adjourn into &s;everal apartments, in order to di&s;cour&s;e over the robbery, and drink a health to all hone&s;t men. But Mrs. Tow-wou&s;e, who&s;e misfortune it was commonly to &s;ee things a little perver&s;ely, began to rail at tho&s;e who brought the fellow into her hou&s;e; telling her hu&s;band, <Q>they were very likely to thrive, who kept a hou&s;e of entertainment for beggars and thieves.</Q></P>
<P>The mob had now fini&s;hed their &s;earch; and could find nothing about the captive likely to prove any evidence; for as to the cloaths, tho' the mob was very well &s;atisfied with that proof; yet, as the &s;urgeon ob&s;erved, they could not convict him, be|cau&s;e they were not found in his cu&s;tody; to which Barnabas agreed, and added, that the&s;e things were <HI>bona waviata,</HI> and belonged to the lord of the man|nor.</P>
<P>'How,' &s;ays the &s;urgeon, <Q>do you &s;ay the&s;e goods belong to the lord of the manor?</Q> 'I do,' cried Barnabas. 'Then I deny it,' &s;ays the &s;urgeon. <Q>What can the lord of the manor have to do in the ca&s;e? Will any one attempt to per&s;uade me that what a man finds is not his own?</Q> <Q>I have heard (&s;ays an old fellow in the corner) ju&s;tice Wi&s;eone &s;ay, that if every man had his right, whatever is found belongs to the king of London.</Q> <Q>That may be true,</Q> &s;ays Barnabas, <Q>in &s;ome &s;en&s;e: for the law makes a difference between things &s;tolen and things found: for a thing may be &s;tolen that
<PB N="73" REF="023370_0072_0FBF3BCACEAEDD88">
never is found; and a thing may be found that ne|ver was &s;tolen. Now goods that are both &s;tolen and found are <HI>waviata;</HI> and they belong to the lord of the manor.</Q> <Q>So the lord of the manor is the re|ceiver of &s;tolen goods,</Q> (&s;ays the doctor;) at which there was a univer&s;al laugh, being fir&s;t begun by him&s;elf.</P>
<P>While the pri&s;oner, by per&s;i&s;ting in his inno|cence, had almo&s;t (as there was no evidence again&s;t him) brought over Barnabas, the &s;urgeon, Tow|wou&s;e, and &s;everal others to his &s;ide; Betty inform|ed them, that they had over-looked a little piece of gold, which &s;he had carried up to the man in bed; and which he offered to &s;wear among&s;t a million, aye, among&s;t ten thou&s;and. This immediately turned the &s;cale again&s;t the pri&s;oner; and every one now concluded him guilty. It was re&s;olved there|fore, to keep him &s;ecure that night, and early in the morning to carry him before a ju&s;tice.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Shewing how Mrs. Tow-wou&s;e was a little mollified; and how officious Mr. Barnabas and the &s;urgeon were to pro&s;ecute the thief: with a di&s;&s;ertation accounting for their zeal, and that of many other per&s;ons not mentioned in this hi&s;tory.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>BETTY told her mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;he believed the man in bed was a greater man than they took him for: for be&s;ides the extreme whitene&s;s of his &s;kin, and the &s;oftne&s;s of his hands, &s;he ob&s;erved a very great familiarity between the gentleman and him; and added, &s;he was certain they were intimate ac|quaintance, if not relations.</P>
<P>This &s;omewhat abated the &s;everity of Mrs. Tow|wou&s;e's
<PB N="74" REF="023370_0073_0FBF3BCCFB185390">
countenance. She &s;aid, <Q>God forbid &s;he &s;hould not di&s;charge the duty of a Chri&s;tian, &s;ince the poor gentleman was brought to her hou&s;e. She had a natural antipathy to vagabonds: but could pity the misfortunes of a Chri&s;tian as &s;oon as another.</Q> Tow-wou&s;e &s;aid, <Q>If the traveller be a gentleman, tho' he had no money about him now, we &s;hall mo&s;t likely be paid hereafter; &s;o 'you may begin to &s;core whenever you will.</Q> Mrs. Tow-wou&s;e an&s;wered. <Q>Hold your &s;imple tongue, and don't in&s;truct me in my bu&s;ine&s;s. I am &s;ure I am &s;orry for the gentleman's misfortune with all my heart; and I hope the villain who hath u&s;ed him &s;o barbarou&s;ly will be hanged. Betty, go, &s;ee what he wants. God forbid he &s;hould want any thing in my hou&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>Barnabas and the &s;urgeon went up to Jo&s;eph, to &s;atisfy them&s;elves concerning the piece of gold. Jo&s;eph was with difficulty prevailed upon to &s;hew it them; but would by no entreaties be brought to deliver it out of his own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. He however atte&s;ted this to be the &s;ame which had been taken from him; and Betty was ready to &s;wear to the finding it on the thief.</P>
<P>The only difficulty that remained, was how to produce this gold before the ju&s;tice: for as to car|rying Jo&s;eph him&s;elf, it &s;eemed impo&s;&s;ible; nor was there any great likelihood of obtaining it from him: for he had fa&s;tened it with a riband to his arm, and &s;olemnly vowed, that nothing but irre&s;i&s;tible force &s;hould ever &s;eparate them; in which re&s;olution, Mr. Adams clenching a fi&s;t rather le&s;s than the knuckle of an ox, declared he would &s;upport him.</P>
<P>A di&s;pute aro&s;e on this occa&s;ion concerning evi|dence, not very nece&s;&s;ary to be related here; after which the &s;urgeon dre&s;t Mr. Jo&s;eph's head; &s;till
<PB N="75" REF="023370_0074_0FBF3BD0C9A44AD0">
per&s;i&s;ting in the imminent danger in which his pa|tient lay; but concluding with a very important look, <Q>that he began to have hopes; that he &s;hould &s;end him a &s;anative &s;oporiferous draught, and would &s;ee him in the morning.</Q> After which Bar|nabas and he departed, and left Mr. Jo&s;eph and Mr. Adams together.</P>
<P>Adams informed Jo&s;eph of the occa&s;ion of this journey which he was making to London, namely, to publi&s;h three volumes of &s;ermons; being encou|raged, as he &s;aid by an adverti&s;ement lately &s;et forth by a &s;ociety of book&s;ellers, who propo&s;ed to pur|cha&s;e, any copies offered to them, at a price to be &s;ettled by two per&s;ons: but tho' he imagined he &s;hould get a con&s;iderable &s;um of money on this oc|ca&s;ion, which his family were in urgent need of, he prote&s;ted he would not leave Jo&s;eph in his pre&s;ent condition: finally, he told him, <Q>he had nine &s;hil|lings and three pence half-penny in his pocket, which he was welcome to u&s;e as he plea&s;ed.</Q></P>
<P>This goodne&s;s of par&s;on Adams brought tears in|to Jo&s;eph's eyes; he declared he had now a <Q>&s;e|cond rea&s;on to de&s;ire life, that he might &s;hew his gratitude to &s;uch a friend.</Q> Adams bade him <Q>be chearful; for that he plainly &s;aw the &s;urgeon be|&s;ides his ignorance, de&s;ired to make a merit of cur|ing him, tho' the wounds in his head, he perceiv|ed, were by no means dangerous; that he was convinced he had no fever, and doubted not but he would be able to travel in a day or two.</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e words infu&s;ed a &s;pirit into Jo&s;eph; he &s;aid, <Q>he found him&s;elf very &s;ore from the brui&s;es, but had no rea&s;on to think any of his bones injured, or that he had received any harm in his in&s;ide; un|le&s;s that he felt &s;omething very odd in his &s;tomach: but he knew not whether that might not ari&s;e from
<PB N="76" REF="023370_0075_0FBF3BD258CC82C0">
not having eaten one mor&s;el for above twenty-four hours.</Q> Being then a&s;ked if he had any inclinati|on to eat, he an&s;wered in the affirmative. Then par&s;on Adams de&s;ired him to name what he had the greate&s;t fancy for; whether a poached egg, or chicken broth: he an&s;wered, <Q>he could eat both ve|ry well; but that he &s;eemed to have the greate&s;t appetite for a piece of boiled beef and cabbage.</Q></P>
<P>Adams was plea&s;ed with &s;o perfect a confirma|tion that he had not the lea&s;t fever; but advi&s;ed him to a lighter diet, for that evening. He accord|ingly eat either a rabbit or a fowl, I never could with any tolerable certainty di&s;cover which; after this, he was, by Mrs. Tow-wou&s;e's order, conveyed into a better bed, and equipped with one of her hu&s;band's &s;hirts.</P>
<P>In the morning early, Barnabas and the &s;urgeon came to the inn, in order to &s;ee the thief conveyed before the ju&s;tice. They had con&s;umed the whole night in debating what mea&s;ures they &s;hould take to produce the piece of gold in evidence again&s;t him: for they were both extremely zealous in the bu&s;i|ne&s;s, tho' neither of them were in the lea&s;t intere&s;t|ed in the pro&s;ecution; neither of them had ever re|ceived any private injury from the fellow, nor had either of them ever been &s;u&s;pected of loving the publick well enough to give them a &s;ermon or a do&s;e of phy&s;ick for nothing.</P>
<P>To help our reader therefore as much as po&s;&s;ible to account for this zeal, we mu&s;t inform him, that, as this pari&s;h was &s;o unfortunate as to have no law|yer in it; there had been a con&s;tant contention be|tween the two doctors, &s;piritual and phy&s;ical, con|cerning their abilities in a &s;cience, in which, as neither of them profe&s;&s;ed it, they had equal preten|&s;ions to di&s;pute each other's opinions. The&s;e di&s;|putes
<PB N="77" REF="023370_0076_0FBF3BD4AC4C2A08">
were carried on with great contempt on both &s;ides, and had almo&s;t divided the pari&s;h; Mr. Tow|wou&s;e and one half of the neighbours inclining to the &s;urgeon, and Mrs. Tow-wou&s;e with the other half to the par&s;on. The &s;urgeon drew his know|ledge from tho&s;e ine&s;timable fountains called the Attorney's Pocket-Companion, and Mr. Jacob's Law-tables; Barnabas tru&s;ted entirely to Wood's In&s;titutes. It happened on this occa&s;ion, as was pretty frequently the ca&s;e, that the&s;e two learned men differed about the &s;ufficiency of evidence: the doctor being of opinion, that the maid's oath would convict the pri&s;oner without producing the gold; the par&s;on <HI>&egrave; contra, totis viribus.</HI> To di&s;play their parts therefore before the ju&s;tice and the pari&s;h, was the &s;ole motive, which we can di&s;cover, to this zeal which both of them pretended to have for public ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>O Vanity! how little is thy force acknowledged, or thy operations di&s;cerned! How wantonly do&s;t thou deceive mankind under different di&s;gui&s;es! Sometimes thou do&s;t wear the face of pity, &s;ome|times of genero&s;ity: nay, thou ha&s;t the a&s;&s;urance even to put on tho&s;e glorious ornaments which be|long only to heroick virtue. Thou odious, deform|ed mon&s;ter! whom prie&s;ts have railed at, philo&s;o|phers de&s;pi&s;ed, and poets ridiculed: is there a wretch &s;o abandoned as to own thee for an acquaint|ance in publick? yet how few will refu&s;e to enjoy thee in private! nay, thou art the pur&s;uit of mo&s;t men through their lives. The greate&s;t villainies are daily practi&s;ed to plea&s;e thee: nor is the meane&s;t thief below, or the greate&s;t hero above thy notice. Thy embraces are often the &s;ole aim and &s;ole re|ward of the private robbery, and the plundered pro|vince. It is to pamper up thee, thou harlot, that
<PB N="78" REF="023370_0077_0FBF3BD74555D458">
we attempt to withdraw from others what we do not want, or to withhold from them what they do. All our pa&s;&s;ions are thy &s;laves. Avarice it&s;elf is of|ten no more than thy hand-maid, and even lu&s;t thy pimp. Thy bully fear, like a coward, flies before thee, and joy and grief hide their heads in thy pre|&s;ence.</P>
<P>I know thou wilt think, that whil&s;t I abu&s;e thee, I court thee; and that thy love hath in&s;pired me to write this &s;arca&s;tical panegyric on thee: but thou art deceived, I value thee not a farthing; nor will it give me any pain, if thou &s;hould&s;t pre|vail on the reader to cen&s;ure this digre&s;&s;ion as ar|rant non&s;en&s;e: for know, to thy confu&s;ion, that I have introduced thee for no other purpo&s;e than to lengthen out a &s;hort chapter; and &s;o I return to my hi&s;tory.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The e&s;cape of the thief. Mr. Adams's di&s;appointment. The arrival of two very extraordinary per&s;onages, and the introduction of par&s;on Adams to par&s;on Barnabas.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>BARNABAS and the &s;urgeon being returned, as we have &s;aid, to the inn, in order to con|vey the thief before the ju&s;tice, were greatly con|cerned to find a &s;mall accident had happened, which &s;omewhat di&s;concerted them; and this was no other than the thief's e&s;cape, who had mode&s;t|ly withdrawn him&s;elf by night, declining all o&s;ten|tation, and not chu&s;ing, in imitation of &s;ome great men, to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf at the expence of be|ing pointed at.</P>
<P>When the company had retired the evening be|fore,
<PB N="79" REF="023370_0078_0FBF3BDBE12B7480">
the thief was detained in a room where the con&s;table, and one of the young fellows who took him, were planted as his guard. About the &s;econd watch, a general complaint of drowth was made both by the pri&s;oner and his keepers; among whom it was at la&s;t agreed, that the con&s;table &s;hould remain on duty, and the young fellow call up the tap&s;ter; in which di&s;po&s;ition the latter ap|prehended not the lea&s;t danger, as the con&s;table was well armed, and could be&s;ides ea&s;ily &s;ummon him back to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, if the pri&s;oner made the lea&s;t attempt to gain his liberty.</P>
<P>The young fellow had not long left the room, before it came into the con&s;table's head, that the pri&s;oner might leap on him by &s;urpri&s;e, and there|by preventing him of the u&s;e of his weapons, e&s;pe|cially the long &s;taff, in which he chiefly confided, might reduce the &s;ucce&s;s of the &s;truggle to an equal chance. He wi&s;ely, therefore, to prevent this in|convenience, &s;lipt out of the room him&s;elf, and locked the door, waiting without with his &s;taff in his hand, ready lifted to fell the unhappy pri&s;oner, if by ill fortune he &s;hould attempt to break out.</P>
<P>But human life, as hath been di&s;covered by &s;ome great man or other, (for I would by no means be under&s;tood to affect the honour of making any &s;uch di&s;covery) very much re&s;embles a game at Che&s;s: for as in the latter, while a game&s;ter is too atten|tive to &s;ecure him&s;elf very &s;trongly on one &s;ide the board, he is apt to leave an unguarded opening on the other; &s;o doth it often happen in life; and &s;o did it happen on this occa&s;ion: for whil&s;t the cau|tious con&s;table with &s;uch wonderful &s;agacity had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of the door, he mo&s;t unhappily forgot the window.</P>
<P>The thief, who played on the other &s;ide, no
<PB N="80" REF="023370_0079_0FBF3BDCC8CDF7A0">
&s;ooner perceived this opening, than he began to move that way; and finding the pa&s;&s;age ea&s;y he took with him the young fellow's hat; and with|out any ceremony, &s;tepped into the &s;treet, and made the be&s;t of his way.</P>
<P>The young fellow returning with a double mug of &s;trong beer, was a little &s;urprized to find the con&s;table at the door; but much more &s;o, when, the door being opened, he perceived the pri&s;oner had made his e&s;cape, and which way. He threw down the beer, and without uttering any thing to the con&s;table, except a hearty cur&s;e or two, he nimbly leapt out at the window, and went again in pur&s;uit of his prey; being very unwilling to lo&s;e the reward which he had a&s;&s;ured him&s;elf of.</P>
<P>The con&s;table hath not been di&s;charged of &s;u&s;|picion on this account: it hath been &s;aid, that not being concerned in the taking the thief, he could not have been entitled to any part of the reward, if he had been convicted; that the thief had &s;everal guineas in his pocket; that it was very unlikely he &s;hould have been guilty of &s;uch an over&s;ight; that his pretence for leaving the room was ab&s;urd; that it was his con&s;tant maxim, that a wi&s;e man never refu&s;ed money on any conditions; that at every election he always had &s;old his vote to both parties, &amp;c.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding the&s;e and many other &s;uch allegations, I am &s;ufficiently convinced of his in|nocence; having been po&s;itively a&s;&s;ured of it, by tho&s;e who received their informations from his own mouth; which, in the opinion of &s;ome mo|derns, is the be&s;t and indeed only evidence.</P>
<P>All the family were now up, and with many others a&s;&s;embled in the kitchen, where Mr. Tow|wou&s;e was in &s;ome tribulation; the &s;urgeon hav|ing
<PB N="81" REF="023370_0080_0FBF3BDF60C5F808">
declared, that by law he was liable to be in|dicted for the thief's e&s;cape, as it was out of his hou&s;e: he was a little comforted however by Mr. Barnabas's opinion, that as the e&s;cape was by night, the indictment would not lie.</P>
<P>Mrs. Tow-wou&s;e delivered her&s;elf in the fol|lowing words: <Q>Sure never was &s;uch a fool as my hu&s;band! would any other per&s;on living have left a man in the cu&s;tody of &s;uch a drunken drow&s;y blockhead as Tom Suckbribe;</Q> (which was the con&s;table's name) <Q>and if he could be indicted without any harm to his wife and children, I &s;hould be glad of it.</Q> (Then the bell rung in Jo&s;eph's room.) <Q>Why, Betty, John, Chamber|lain, where the devil are you all? Have you no ears, or no con&s;cience, not to tend the &s;ick bet|ter?&mdash;See what the gentleman wants; why don't you go your&s;elf, Mr. Tow-wou&s;e? but any one may die for you; you have no more feeling than a dead-board. If a man lived a fortnight in your hou&s;e without &s;pending a penny, you would ne|ver put him in mind of it. See whether he drinks tea or coffee for breakfa&s;t.</Q> 'Yes, my dear,' cried Tow-wou&s;e. She then a&s;ked the doctor and Mr. Barnabas what morning's draught they cho&s;e, who an&s;wered they had a pot of cyder-and at the fire; which we will leave them merry over, and return to Jo&s;eph.</P>
<P>He had ri&s;en pretty early this morning: but tho' his wounds were far from threatening any dan|ger, he was &s;o &s;ore with the brui&s;es, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to think of undertaking a jour|ney yet; Mr. Adams therefore, who&s;e &s;tock was vi&s;ibly decrea&s;ed with the expences of &s;upper and breakfa&s;t, and which could not &s;urvive that day's &s;coring, began to con&s;ider how it was po&s;&s;ible to
<PB N="82" REF="023370_0081_0FBF3BE0AE9D6920">
recruit it. At la&s;t he cry'd, <Q>He had luckily hit on a &s;ure method; and though it would oblige him to return him&s;elf home together with Jo&s;eph, it mattered not much.</Q> He then &s;ent for Tow|wou&s;e, and taking him into another room, told him, <Q>He wanted to borrow three guineas, for which he would put ample &s;ecurity into his hand.</Q> Tow-wou&s;e, who expected a watch, or ring, or &s;omething of double the value, an&s;wered, <Q>He be|lieved he could furni&s;h him.</Q> Upon which A|dams, pointing to his &s;addle-bag, told him with a voice and face full of &s;olemnity, <Q>That there were in that bag no le&s;s than nine volumes of manu|&s;cript &s;ermons, as well worth a hundred pounds as a &s;hilling was worth twelve pence, and that he would depo&s;it one of the volumes in his hands by way of pledge; not doubting but that he would have the hone&s;ty to return it on his repayment of the money: for otherwi&s;e he mu&s;t be a very great lo&s;er, &s;eeing that every volume would at lea&s;t bring him ten pounds, as he had been informed by a neighbouring clergyman in the country: for, &s;aid he, as to my own part, having never yet dealt in printing, I do not pretend to a&s;certain the ex|act value of &s;uch things.</Q></P>
<P>Tow-wou&s;e, who was a little &s;urprized at the pawn, &s;aid (and not without &s;ome truth) <Q>That he was no judge of the price of &s;uch kind of goods: and as for money, he really was very &s;hort.</Q> Adams an&s;wered, <Q>Certainly he would not &s;cruple to lend him three guineas on what was undoubt|edly worth at lea&s;t ten.</Q> The landlord replied, <Q>He did not believe he had &s;o much money in the hou&s;e, and be&s;ides he was to make up a &s;um. He was very confident the books were of much higher value, and heartily &s;orry it did not &s;uit
<PB N="83" REF="023370_0082_0FBF3BE20D40CE98">
him.</Q> He then cryed out, coming Sir! though no body called; and ran down &s;tairs without any fear of breaking his neck.</P>
<P>Poor Adams was extremely dejected at this di&s;|appointment, nor knew he what farther &s;tratagem to try. He immediately applied to his pipe, his con&s;tant friend and comfort in his afflictions; and leaning over the rails he devoted him&s;elf to medi|tation, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the in&s;piring fumes of tobacco.</P>
<P>He had on a night-cap drawn over his wig, and a &s;hort great coat, which half-covered his ca&s;&s;ock; a dre&s;s which, added to &s;omething comical enough in his countenance, compo&s;ed a figure likely to attract the eyes of tho&s;e who were not ever-given to ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t he was &s;moaking his pipe in this po&s;|ture, a coach and fix, with a numerous attendance, drove into the inn. There alighted from the coach a young fellow and a brace of pointers, after which another young fellow leapt from the box, and &s;hook the former by the hand; and both, together with the dogs, were in&s;tantly conducted by Mr. Tow-wou&s;e into an apartment; whither as they pa&s;&s;ed, they entertained them&s;elves with the fol|lowing &s;hort facetious dialogue.</P>
<P>'You are a pretty fellow for a coachman, Jack!' &s;ays he from the coach, <Q>you had almo&s;t overturn|ed us ju&s;t now.</Q> 'Pox take you,' &s;ays the coach|man, <Q>if I had only broke your neck, it would have been &s;aving &s;omebody el&s;e the trouble: but I &s;hould have been &s;orry for the pointers.</Q> 'Why you &s;on of a b&mdash;,' an&s;wered the other, <Q>if no body could &s;hoot better than you, the pointers would be of no u&s;e.</Q> <Q>D&mdash;n me, &s;ays the coachman, I will &s;hoot with you, five guineas a &s;hot.</Q> 'You be hanged,' &s;ays the other, <Q>for
<PB N="84" REF="023370_0083_0FBF3BE5C8A7A708">
five guineas you &s;hall &s;hoot at my a&mdash;.</Q> 'Done,' &s;ays the coachman, <Q>I'll pepper you better than ever you was pepper'd by Jenny Bouncer.</Q> 'Pepper your grandmother,' &s;ays the other, <Q>here's Tow-wou&s;e will let you &s;hoot at him for a &s;hil|ling a time.</Q> 'I know his honour better,' cries Tow-wou&s;e, <Q>I never &s;aw a &s;urer &s;hoot at a par|tridge. Every man mi&s;&s;es now and then; but if I could &s;hoot half as well as his honour, I would de&s;ire no better livelihood than I could get by my gun.</Q> 'Pox on you,' &s;aid the coachman, <Q>you demoli&s;h more game now than your head's worth. There's a bitch, Tow-wou&s;e, by G&mdash;&s;he never blink'd a bird in her life.</Q> <Q>I have a puppy not a year old &s;hall hunt with her for a hundred,</Q> cries the other gentleman, 'Done,' &s;ays the coach|man, <Q>but you will be pox'd before you make the bett. If you have a mind for a bett,</Q> cries the coachman, <Q>I will match my &s;potted dog with your white bitch for a hundred, play or pay.</Q> 'Done,' &s;ays the other, <Q>and I'll run Baldface again&s;t Slouch with you for another.</Q> 'No,' cries he from the box, <Q>but I'll venture Mi&s;s Jenny again&s;t Baldface or Hannibal either.</Q> 'Go to the devil,' cries he from the coach, <Q>I will make every bett your own way, to be &s;ure! I will match Hannibal with Slouch for a thou&s;and, if you dare, and I &s;ay done fir&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>They were now arrived, and the reader will be very contented to leave them, and repair to the kit|chen, where Barnabas, the &s;urgeon, and an exci&s;e|man were &s;moaking their pipes over &s;ome Cyder|and, and where the &s;ervants, who attended the two noble gentlemen we have ju&s;t &s;een alight, were now arrived.</P>
<P>'Tom,' cries one of the footmen, <Q>there's par&s;on
<PB N="85" REF="023370_0084_0FBF3BEB1166E138">
Adams &s;moaking his pipe in the gallery.</Q> 'Yes &s;ays Tom, <Q>I pulled off my hat to him, and the par&s;on &s;poke to me.</Q></P>
<P>'Is the gentleman a clergyman then?' &s;ays Bar|nabas, (for his ca&s;&s;ock had been tied up when he fir&s;t arrived.) 'Yes, Sir,' an&s;wered the footman, <Q>and one there is but few like.</Q> 'Aye,' &s;aid Barnabas, <Q>If I had known it &s;ooner, I &s;hould have de&s;ired his company; I would always pay a proper re&s;pect for the cloth; but what &s;ay you, Doctor, &s;hall we adjourn into a room, and invite him to take part of a bowl of punch?</Q></P>
<P>This propo&s;al was immediately agreed to, and executed; and par&s;on Adams accepting the invita|tion, much civility pa&s;&s;ed between the two clergy|men, who both declared the great honour they had for the cloth. They had not been long together, before they entered into a di&s;cour&s;e on &s;mall tithes, which continued a full hour, without the doctor o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> exci&s;eman's having one opportunity to offer a word.</P>
<P>It was then propo&s;ed to begin a general conver|&s;ation, and the exci&s;eman opened on foreign affairs: but a word unluckily dropping from one of them in|troduced a di&s;&s;ertation on the hard&s;hips &s;uffered by the inferior clergy; which after a long duration, concluded with bringing the nine volumes of &s;er|mons on the carpet.</P>
<P>Barnabas greatly di&s;couraged poor Adams; he &s;aid, <Q>The age was &s;o wicked, that nobody read &s;ermons:</Q> Would you think it, Mr. Adams, (&s;aid he) <Q>I once intended to print a volume of &s;ermons my&s;elf, and they had the approbation of two or three bi&s;hops: but what do you think a book&s;el|ler offered me?</Q> 'Twelve guineas perhaps (cried Adams.') 'Not twelve pence, I a&s;&s;ure you,' an|&s;wered Barnabas; <Q>nay, the dog refu&s;ed me a Con|cordance
<PB N="86" REF="023370_0085_0FBF3BEE179DB720">
in exchange.&mdash;At la&s;t I offered to give him the printing them for the &s;ake of dedicating them to that very gentleman who ju&s;t now drove his own coach into the inn; and I a&s;&s;ure you he had the impudence to refu&s;e my offer: by which means I lo&s;t a good living, that was afterwards given away in exchange for a pointer, to one who&mdash;but I will not &s;ay any thing again&s;t the cloth. So you may gue&s;s, Mr. Adams, what you are to expect; for if &s;ermons would have gone down, I believe&mdash;I will not be vain: but to be conci&s;e with you, three bi&s;hops &s;aid, they were the be&s;t that ever were writ: but indeed there are a pretty moderate number printed already, and not all &s;old yet.</Q>&mdash;'Pray, Sir,' &s;aid Adams, <Q>to what do you think the numbers may amount?</Q> 'Sir,' an&s;wer|ed Barnabas, <Q>a book&s;eller told me, he believed five thou&s;and volumes at lea&s;t.</Q> 'Five thou&s;and!' <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">uoth the &s;urgeon, <Q>what can they be writ upon? I remember when I was a boy, I u&s;ed to read one Tillot&s;on's &s;ermons; and I am &s;ure, if a man practi&s;ed half &s;o much as is in one of tho&s;e &s;er|mons, he will go to heaven.</Q> 'Doctor,' cried Barnabas, <Q>you have a prophane way of talking, for which I mu&s;t reprove you. A man can never have his duty too frequently inculcated into him. And as for Tillot&s;on, to be &s;ure he was a good writer, and &s;aid things very well: but compari&s;ons are odious; another man may write as well as he&mdash;I believe there are &s;ome of my &s;ermons,</Q>&mdash;and then he applied the candle to his pipe&mdash;<Q>And I believe there are &s;ome of my di&s;cour&s;es,</Q> cries Adams, <Q>which the bi&s;hops would not think totally unwor|thy of being printed; and I have been informed, I might procure a very large &s;um (indeed an im|men&s;e one) on them.</Q> 'I doubt that,' an&s;wered
<PB N="87" REF="023370_0086_0FBF3BF47212D518">
Barnabas, <Q>however, if you de&s;ire to make &s;ome money of them, perhaps you may &s;ell them by ad|verti&s;ing the manu&s;cript &s;ermons, of a clergyman lately decea&s;ed, all warranted originals, and never printed. And now I think of it, I &s;hould be obli|ged to you, if there be ever a funeral one among them, to lend it me: for I am this very day to preach a funeral &s;ermon; for which I have not penned a line, though I am to have a double price.</Q> Adams an&s;wered, <Q>He had but one, which he feared would not &s;erve his purpo&s;e, being &s;acred to the memory of a magi&s;trate, who had exerted him&s;elf very &s;ingularly in the pre&s;ervation of the morality of his neighbours, in&s;omuch that he had neither ale-hou&s;e, nor lewd woman in the pari&s;h where he lived.</Q>&mdash;'No,' replyed Barnabas, <Q>that will not do quite &s;o well; for the decea&s;ed upon who&s;e vir|tues I am to harangue, was a little too much ad|dicted to liquor, and publickly kept a mi&s;tre&s;s I believe I mu&s;t take a common &s;ermon, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to my memory to introduce &s;omething hand&s;ome on him.</Q>&mdash;'To your invention rather,' (&s;aid the doctor) <Q>your memory will be apter to put you out: for no man living remembers any thing good of him.</Q></P>
<P>With &s;uch kind of &s;piritual di&s;cour&s;e, they emp|tied the bowl of punch, paid their reckoning, and &s;eparated: Adams and the doctor went up to Jo|&s;eph, par&s;on Barnabas departed to celebrate the a|fore&s;aid decea&s;ed, and the exci&s;eman de&s;cended into the cellar to gauge the ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>Jo&s;eph was now ready to &s;it down to a loin of mutton, and waited for Mr. Adams, when he and the doctor came in. The doctor having felt his pul&s;e, and examined his wounds, declared him much better, which he imputed to that &s;anative
<PB N="88" REF="023370_0087_0FBF3BF95E19E308">
&s;oporiferous draught, a medicine, 'who&s;e virtues,' he &s;aid, 'were never to be &s;ufficiently extolled.' And great indeed they mu&s;t be, if Jo&s;eph was &s;o much indebted to them as the doctor imagined; &s;ince nothing more than tho&s;e effluvia, which e&s;caped the cork, could have contributed to his recovery: for the medicine had &s;tood untouched in the window ever &s;ince his arrival.</P>
<P>Jo&s;eph pa&s;&s;ed that day and the three following with his friend Adams, in which nothing &s;o re|markable happened as the &s;wift progre&s;s of his recovery. As he had an excellent habit of body, his wounds were now almo&s;t healed; and his brui&s;es gave him &s;o little unea&s;ine&s;s, that he pre&s;|&s;ed Mr. Adams to let him depart, told him he &s;hould never be able to return &s;ufficient thanks for all his favours; but begged that he might no lon|ger delay his journey to London.</P>
<P>Adams, notwith&s;tanding the ignorance, as he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it, of Mr. Tow-wou&s;e, and the envy (for &s;uch he thought it) of Mr. Barnabas, had great expectations from his &s;ermons: &s;eeing there|fore Jo&s;eph in &s;o good a way, he told him he would agree to his &s;etting out the next morning in the &s;tage-coach, that he believed he &s;hould have &s;uf|ficient, after the reckoning paid, to procure him one day's conveyance in it, and afterwards he would be able to get on, on foot, or might be fa|voured with a lift in &s;ome neighbour's waggon, e&s;pecially as there was then to be a fair in the town whither the coach would carry him, to which num|bers from his pari&s;h re&s;orted&mdash;And as to him&s;elf, he agreed to proceed to the great city.</P>
<P>They were now walking in the inn-yard, when a fat, fair, &s;hort per&s;on rode in, and alighting from his hor&s;e, went directly up to Barnabas, who was
<PB N="89" REF="023370_0088_0FBF3BFACC6DABD0">
&s;moaking his pipe on a bench. The par&s;on and the &s;tranger &s;hook one another very lovingly by the hand, and went into a room together.</P>
<P>The evening now coming on, Jo&s;eph retired to his chamber, whither the good Adams accompa|nied him; and took this opportunity to expatiate on the great mercies God had lately &s;hewn him, of which he ought not only to have the deepe&s;t in|ward &s;en&s;e; but likewi&s;e to expre&s;s outward thankfulne&s;s for them. They therefore fell both on their knees, and &s;pent a con&s;iderable time in prayer and thank&s;giving.</P>
<P>They had ju&s;t fini&s;hed, when Betty came in and told Mr. Adams, Mr. Barnabas de&s;ired to &s;peak to him on &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s of con&s;equence below &s;tairs. Jo&s;eph de&s;ired, if it was likely to detain him long, he would let him know it, that he might go to bed, which Adams promi&s;ed, and in that ca&s;e they wi&s;hed one another good night.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The hi&s;tory of Betty the chambermaid, and an account of what occa&s;ioned the violent &s;cene in the preceding chapter.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>BETTY, who was the occa&s;ion of all this hur|ry, had &s;ome good qualities. She had good|nature, genero&s;ity, and compa&s;&s;ion, but unfortu|nately her con&s;titution was compo&s;ed of tho&s;e warm ingredients, which, though the purity of courts or nunneries might have happily controuled them, were by no means able to endure the tickli&s;h &s;itu|ation of a chambermaid at an inn, who is daily li|able to the &s;olicitations of lovers of all complex|ions, to the dangerous addre&s;&s;es of fine gentlemen of the army, who &s;ometimes are obliged to re&s;ide with them a whole year together; and above all are expo&s;ed to the care&s;&s;es of footmen, &s;tage-coach|men, and drawers; all of whom employ the whole artillery of ki&s;&s;ing, flattering, bribing, and every o|ther
<PB N="97" REF="023370_0096_0FBF3C156DFCFEB8">
weapon which is to be found in the whole armoury of love, again&s;t them.</P>
<P>Betty, who was but one and twenty, had now lived three years in this dangerous &s;ituation, during which &s;he had e&s;caped pretty well. An en&s;ign of foot was the fir&s;t per&s;on who made an impre&s;&s;ion on her heart; he did indeed rai&s;e a flame in her, which required the care of a &s;urgeon to cool.</P>
<P>While &s;he burnt for him, &s;everal others burnt for her. Officers of the army, young gentlemen travelling the we&s;tern circuit, inoffen&s;ive &s;quires, and &s;ome of graver character were &s;et afire by her charms!</P>
<P>At length, having perfectly recovered the effects of her fir&s;t unhappy pa&s;&s;ion, &s;he &s;eemed to have vowed a &s;tate of perpetual ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ity. She was long deaf to all the &s;ufferings of her lovers, till one day, at a neighbouring fair, the rhetoric of John the ho&s;tler, with a new &s;traw hat, and a pint of wine, made a &s;econd conque&s;t over her.</P>
<P>She did not, however, feel any of tho&s;e flames on this occa&s;ion, which had been the con&s;equence of her former amour; nor indeed tho&s;e other ill ef|fects, which prudent young women very ju&s;tly apprehend from too ab&s;olute an indulgence to the pre&s;&s;ing endearments of their lovers. This latter, perhaps, was a little owing to her not being en|tirely con&s;tant to John, with whom &s;he permitted Tom Whipwell the &s;tage-coachman, and now and then a hand&s;ome young traveller, to &s;hare her fa|vours.</P>
<P>Mr. Tow-wou&s;e had for &s;ome time ca&s;t the lan|gui&s;hing eyes of affection on this young maiden. He had laid hold on every opportunity of &s;aying tender things, to her, &s;queezing her by the hand, and &s;ometimes ki&s;&s;ing her lips: for as the violence of
<PB N="98" REF="023370_0097_0FBF3C18F9B10718">
his pa&s;&s;ion had con&s;iderably abated to Mrs. Tow|wou&s;e; &s;o like water, which is &s;topt from its u&s;ual current in one place, it naturally &s;ought a vent in another. Mrs. Tow-wou&s;e is thought to have per|ceived this abatement, and probably it added very little to the natural &s;weetne&s;s of her temper; for though &s;he was as true to her hu&s;band as the dial to the &s;un, &s;he was rather more de&s;irous of being &s;hone on, as being more capable of feeling his warmth.</P>
<P>Ever &s;ince Jo&s;eph's arrival, Betty had conceived an extraordinary liking to him, which di&s;covered it|&s;elf more and more, as he grew better and better; till that fatal evening when, as &s;he was warming his bed, her pa&s;&s;ion grew to &s;uch a height, and &s;o per|fectly ma&s;tered both her mode&s;ty and her rea&s;on, that after many fruitle&s;s hints and fly in&s;inuations, &s;he at la&s;t threw down the warming-pan, and em|bracing him with great eagerne&s;s, &s;wore he was the hand&s;ome&s;t creature &s;he had ever &s;een.</P>
<P>Jo&s;eph in great confu&s;ion leapt from her, and told her, he was &s;orry to &s;ee a young woman ca&s;t off all regard to mode&s;ty: but &s;he had gone too far to re|cede, and grew &s;o very indecent, that Jo&s;eph was ob|liged, contrary to his inclinations, to u&s;e &s;ome vio|lence to her, and taking her in his arms, he &s;hut her out of the room, and locked the door.</P>
<P>How ought man to rejoice, that his cha&s;tity is always in his own power, that if he hath &s;ufficient &s;trength of mind, he hath always a competent &s;trength of body to defend him&s;elf, and cannot like a poor weak woman, be ravi&s;hed again&s;t his will.</P>
<P>Betty was in the mo&s;t violent agitation at this di&s;appointment. Rage and lu&s;t pulled her heart, as with two &s;trings, two different ways; one moment &s;he thought of &s;tabbing Jo&s;eph, the next, of taking
<PB N="99" REF="023370_0098_0FBF3C19AA7CDC90">
him in her arms, and devouring him with ki&s;&s;es; but the latter pa&s;&s;ion was far more prevalent. Then &s;he thought of revenging his refu&s;al on her&s;elf: but whil&s;t &s;he was engaged in this meditation, happily death pre&s;ented him&s;elf to her in &s;o many &s;hapes of drowning, hanging, poi&s;oning, &amp;c. that her di&s;|tracted mind could re&s;olve on none. In this per|turbation of &s;pirit, it accidentally occurred to her memory, that her ma&s;ter's bed was not made; &s;he therefore went directly to his room; where he hap|pened at that time to be engaged at his bureau. As &s;oon as &s;he &s;aw him, &s;he attempted to retire, but he called her back, and taking her by the hand, &s;queezed her &s;o tenderly, at the &s;ame time whi&s;per|ed &s;o many &s;oft things into her ears, and then pre&s;|&s;ed her &s;o clo&s;ely with his ki&s;&s;es, that the vanqui&s;h|ed fair one, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions were already rai&s;ed, and which were not &s;o whim&s;ically capricious that one man only could lay them, though, perhaps, &s;he would have rather preferred that one: the van|qui&s;hed fair-one quietly &s;ubmitted, I &s;ay, to her ma&s;ter's will, who had ju&s;t attained the accompli&s;h|ment of his bli&s;s, when Mrs. Tow-wou&s;e unex|pectedly entered the room, and cau&s;ed all that con|fu&s;ion which we have before &s;een, and which it is not nece&s;&s;ary at pre&s;ent to take any farther notice of: &s;ince without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a &s;ingle hint from us, every reader of any &s;peculation, or experience, tho' not married him&s;elf, may ea&s;ily conjecture, that it concluded with the di&s;charge of Betty, the &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion of Mr. Tow-wou&s;e, with &s;ome things to be performed on his &s;ide by way of gratitude for his wife's goodne&s;s of being reconciled to him, with many hearty promi&s;es never to offend any more in the like manner: and la&s;tly, his quietly and con|tentedly bearing to be reminded of his tran&s;gre&s;&s;i|ons,

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of divi&s;ions in authors.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THERE are certain my&s;teries or &s;ecrets in all trades from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t, from that of prime mini<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ring to this of authoring, which are &s;eldom di&s;covered, unle&s;s to members of the &s;ame calling. Among tho&s;e u&s;ed by us gen|tlemen of the latter occupation, I take this of dividing our works into books and chapters to be none of the lea&s;t con&s;iderable. Now, for want of being truly acquainted with this &s;ecret, common readers imagine, that by this art of dividing, we mean only to &s;well our works to a much larger bulk than they would otherwi&s;e be extended to. The&s;e &s;everal places therefore in our paper, which are filled with our books and chapters, are under|&s;tood as &s;o much buckram, &s;tays, and &s;tay tape in a taylor's bill, &s;erving only to make up the &s;um total, commonly found at the bottom of our fir&s;t page, and of his la&s;t.</P>
<P>But in reality the ca&s;e is otherwi&s;e, and in this, as well as in all other in&s;tances, we con&s;ult the ad|vantage of our reader, not our own; and indeed many notable u&s;es ari&s;e to him from this method: for fir&s;t, tho&s;e little &s;paces between our chapters may be looked upon as an inn or re&s;ting place, where he may &s;top and take a gla&s;s, or any other refre&s;hment, as it plea&s;es him. Nay, our fine rea|ders will, perhaps, be &s;carce able to travel farther
<PB N="101" REF="023370_0100_0FBF37278FA2E630">
than through one of them in a day. As to tho&s;e vacant pages which are placed between our books, they are to be regarded as tho&s;e &s;tages, where in long journies the traveller &s;tays &s;ome time to re|po&s;e him&s;elf, and con&s;ider of what he hath &s;een in the parts he hath already pa&s;t through; a con&s;i|deration which I take the liberty to recommend a little to the reader; for, however &s;wift his ca|pacity may be, I would not advi&s;e him to travel thro' the&s;e pages too fa&s;t: for if he doth, he may probably mi&s;s the &s;eeing &s;ome curious producti|ons of nature, which will be ob&s;erved by the &s;low|er and more accurate reader. A volume without any &s;uch places of re&s;t re&s;embles the opening of wilds or &s;eas, which tires the eye and fatigues the &s;pirit when entered upon.</P>
<P>Secondly, what are the contents prefixed to eve|ry chapter, but &s;o many in&s;criptions over the gates of inns (to continue the &s;ame metaphor) informing the reader what entertainment he is to expect, which, if he likes not, he may travel on to the next: for, in biography, as we are not tied down to an exact concatenation equally with other hi&s;to|rians; &s;o a chapter or two (for in&s;tance this I am now writing) may be often pa&s;&s;ed over without any injury to the whole. And in the&s;e in&s;crip|tions I have been as faithful as po&s;&s;ible, not imi|tating the celebrated Montaigne, who &s;ometimes promi&s;es a great deal and produces nothing at all.</P>
<P>There are, be&s;ides the&s;e more obvious benefits, &s;everal others which our readers enjoy from this art of dividing; though perhaps mo&s;t of them too my&s;terious to be pre&s;ently under&s;tood by any who are not initiated into the &s;cience of authoring. To mention therefore but one which is mo&s;t obvious, it prevents &s;pelling the beauty of a book by turning
<PB N="102" REF="023370_0101_0FBF3729E9948030">

<P>The&s;e divi&s;ions have the &s;anction of great anti|quity. Homer not only divided his great work into twenty-four books, (in compliment perhaps to the twenty-four letters, to which he had very particular obligations) but, according to the opini|on of &s;ome very &s;agacious criticks, hawked them all &s;eparately, delivering only one book at a time, (probably by &s;ub&s;cription.) He was the fir&s;t in|ventor of the art which hath &s;o long lain dormant, of publi&s;hing by numbers, an art now brought to &s;uch perfection, that even dictionaries are divided and exhibited piece-meal to the public; nay, one book&s;eller hath (to encourage learning and ea&s;e the public) contrived to give them a dictionary in this divided manner, for only fifteen &s;hillings more than it would have co&s;t entire.</P>
<P>Virgil hath given us his poem in twelve books, an argument of his mode&s;ty; for by that doubtle&s;s he would in&s;inuate that he pretends to no more than half the merit of the Greek: for the &s;ame rea&s;on, our Milton went originally no farther than ten; 'till being puffed up by the prai&s;e of his friends, he put him&s;elf on the &s;ame footing with the Roman poet.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not however enter &s;o deep into this matter as &s;ome very learned critics have done, who have with infinite labour and acute di&s;cernment di&s;cover|ed what books are proper for embelli&s;hment, and what require &s;implicity only, particularly with re|gard to &s;imilies, which I think are now generally a|greed to become any book but the fir&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A &s;urpri&s;ing in&s;tance of Mr. Adams's &s;hort memory, with the unfortunate con&s;equences which it brought on Jo&s;eph.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MR. Adams and Jo&s;eph were now ready to de|part different ways, when an accident deter|mined the former to return with his friend, which Tow-wou&s;e, Barnabas, and the book&s;eller, had not been able to do. This accident was, that tho&s;e &s;er|mons, which the par&s;on was travelling to London to publi&s;h, were, O my good reader! left behind; what he had mi&s;taken for them in the &s;addle-bags being no other than three &s;hirts, a pair of &s;hoes, and &s;ome other nece&s;&s;aries, which Mrs. Adams, who thought her hu&s;band would want &s;hirts more than &s;ermons on his journey, had carefully provided him.</P>
<P>This di&s;covery was now luckily owing to the pre&s;ence of Jo&s;eph at the opening the &s;addle-bags; who having hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d his friend &s;ay, he carried with him nine volumes of &s;ermons, and not being of that &s;ect of philo&s;ophers, who can reduce all the matter of the world into a nut-&s;hell, &s;eeing there was no room for them in the bags, where the par&s;on had &s;aid they were depo&s;ited, had the curio&s;ity to cry out, <Q>Ble&s;s me, Sir, where are your &s;ermons?</Q> The par&s;on an|&s;wer'd.
<PB N="104" REF="023370_0103_0FBF372E4B45A2A8">
<Q>There, there, child, there they are, under my &s;hirts.</Q> Now it happened that he had taken forth his la&s;t &s;hirt, and the vehicle remained vi&s;ibly empty. 'Sure, Sir,' &s;ays Jo&s;eph, <Q>there is nothing in the bags.</Q> Upon which Adams &s;tarting, and te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ifying &s;ome &s;urprize, cried, <Q>Hey! fie, fie upon it; they are not here &s;ure enough. Ay, they are certainly left behind.</Q></P>
<P>Jo&s;eph was greatly concerned at the unea&s;ine&s;s which he apprehended his friend mu&s;t feel from this di&s;appointment: he begged him to pur&s;ue his journey, and promi&s;ed he would him&s;elf return with the books to him, with the utmo&s;t expedition. 'No, thank you, child,' an&s;wered Adams, <Q>it &s;hall not be &s;o. What would it avail me, to tarry in the great city, unle&s;s I had my di&s;cour&s;es with me, which are, <HI>ut ita dicum,</HI> the &s;ole cau&s;e, the <HI>aitia <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> of my peregrination. No, child, as this ac|cident hath happened, I am re&s;olved to return back to my cure, together with you; which indeed my inclination &s;ufficiently leads me to. This di&s;ap|pointment may perhaps be intended for my good. He concluded with a ver&s;e out of Theocritus, which &s;ignifies no more than, that &s;ometimes it rains, and &s;ometimes the &s;un &s;hines.</Q></P>
<P>Jo&s;eph bowed with obedience and thankfulne&s;s for the inclination which the par&s;on expre&s;&s;ed of returning with him; and now the bill was called for, which, on examination, amounted within a &s;hilling to the &s;um Mr. Adams had in his pocket. Perhaps the reader may wonder how he was able to produce a &s;ufficient &s;um for &s;o many days: that he may not be &s;urprized therefore, it cannot be unnece&s;&s;ary to acquaint him, that he had borrow|ed a guinea of a &s;ervant belonging to the coach and &s;ix, who had been formerly one of his pari&s;hion|ers,
<PB N="105" REF="023370_0104_0FBF372F28742BB0">
and who&s;e ma&s;ter, the owner of the coach, then lived within three miles of him: for &s;o good was the credit of Mr. Adams, that even Mr. Pe|ter the lady Booby's &s;teward would have lent him a guinea with very little &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>Mr. Adams di&s;charged the bill, and they were both &s;etting out, having agreed to ride and tie; a method of travelling much u&s;ed by per&s;ons who have but one hor&s;e between them&punc; and is thus per|formed. The two travellers &s;et out together, one on hor&s;eback, and the other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">: Now, as it ge|nerally happens that he on hor&s;eback outgoes him on foot, the cu&s;tom is, that when he arrives at the di&s;tance agreed on, he is to di&s;mount, tie the hor&s;e to &s;ome gate, tree, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, or other thing, and then proceed on foot; when the other comes up to the hor&s;e, he unties him, mounts and gallops on, 'till having pa&s;&s;ed by his fellow-traveller, he li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ewi&s;e arrives at the place of tying. And this is that me|thod of travelling &s;o much in u&s;e among our pru|dent ance&s;tors, who knew that hor&s;es had mouths as well as legs, and that they could not u&s;e the lat|ter, without being at the expence of &s;uffering the bea&s;ts them&s;elves to u&s;e the former. This was the method in u&s;e in tho&s;e days, when, in&s;tead of a coach and &s;ix, a member of parliament's lady u&s;ed to mount a pillion behind her hu&s;band; and a grave &s;erjeant at law conde&s;cended to amble to We&s;tmin&s;ter on an ea&s;y pad, with his clerk kick|ing his heels behind him.</P>
<P>Adams was now gone &s;ome minutes, having in|&s;i&s;ted on Jo&s;eph's beginning the journey on hor&s;e|back, and Jo&s;eph had his foot in the &s;tirrup, when the ho&s;tler pre&s;ented him a bill for the hor&s;e's board during his re&s;idence at the inn. Jo&s;eph &s;aid Mr. Adams had paid all; but this matter be|ing
<PB N="106" REF="023370_0105_0FBF3730A72266F0">
referred to Mr. Tow-wou&s;e, was by him de|cided in favour of the ho&s;tler, and indeed with truth and ju&s;tice: for this was a fre&s;h in&s;tance of that &s;hortne&s;s of memory which did not ari&s;e from want of parts, but that continual hurry in which par&s;on Adams was always involved.</P>
<P>Jo&s;eph was now reduced to a dilemma which extremely puzzled him. The &s;um due for hor&s;e|meat was twelve &s;hillings, (for Adams, who had borrowed the bea&s;t of his clerk, had ordered him to be fed as well as they could feed him) and the ca&s;h in his pocket amounted to &s;ixpence, (for A|dams had divided the la&s;t &s;hilling with him.) Now tho' there have been &s;ome ingenious per&s;ons who have contrived to pay twelve &s;hillings with &s;ixpence, Jo&s;eph was not one of them. He had never contracted a debt in his life, and was con|&s;equently the le&s;s ready at an expedient to extri|cate him&s;elf. Tow-wou&s;e was willing to give him credit 'till next time, to which Mrs. Tow-wou&s;e would probably have con&s;ented (for &s;uch was Jo&s;eph's beauty, that it had made &s;ome im|pre&s;&s;ion even on that piece of flint which that good woman wore in her bo&s;om by way of heart.) Jo&s;eph would have found therefore, very likely, the pa&s;&s;age free, had he not, when he hone&s;tly di&s;|covered the nakedne&s;s of his pockets, pull'd out that little piece of gold which we have mentioned before. This cau&s;ed Mrs. Tow-wou&s;e's eyes to water; &s;he told Jo&s;eph, &s;he did not conceive a man could want money whil&s;t he had gold in his pocket. Jo&s;eph an&s;wered, he had &s;uch a value for that little piece of gold, that he would not part with it for a hundred times the riches which the greate&s;t e&s;quire in the country was worth. <Q>A pretty way indeed,</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Tow-wou&s;e, <Q>to
<PB N="107" REF="023370_0106_0FBF3732CDEBE760">
run in debt, and then refu&s;e to part with your money, becau&s;e you have a value for it. I ne|ver knew any piece of gold of more value than as many &s;hillings as it would change for.</Q> <Q>Not to pre&s;erve my life from &s;tarving, nor to re|deem it from a robber, would I part with this dear piece,</Q> an&s;wered Jo&s;eph. 'What,' (&s;ays Mrs. Tow-wou&s;e) <Q>I &s;uppo&s;e it was given you by &s;ome vile trollop, &s;ome mi&s;s or other; if it had been the pre&s;ent of a virtuous woman, you would not have had &s;uch a value for it. My hu&s;band is a fool if he parts with the hor&s;e with|out being paid for him.</Q> <Q>No, no, I can't part with the hor&s;e indeed till I have the money,</Q> cried Tow-wou&s;e. A re&s;olution highly com|mended by a lawyer then in the yard, who declar|ed Mr. Tow-wou&s;e might ju&s;tify the detainer.</P>
<P>As we cannot therefore at pre&s;ent get Mr. Jo|&s;eph out of the inn, we &s;hall leave him in it, and carry our reader on after par&s;on Adams, who, his mind being perfectly at ea&s;e, fell into a contempla|tion on a pa&s;&s;age in AE&s;chylus, which entertained him for three miles together, without &s;uffering him once to reflect on his fellow-traveller.</P>
<P>At length, having &s;pun out his thread, and being now at the &s;ummit of a hill, he ca&s;t his eyes back|wards, and wondered that he could not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> any &s;ign of Jo&s;eph. As he left him ready to mount the hor&s;e, he could not apprehend any mi&s;chief had hap|pened, neither could he &s;u&s;pect that he mi&s;&s;ed his way, it being &s;o broad and plain: the only rea&s;on which pre&s;ented it&s;elf to him, was, that he had met with an acquaintance who had prevailed with him to delay &s;ome time in di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>He therefore re&s;olved to proceed &s;lowly forwards, not doubting but that he &s;hould be &s;hortly overtak|en
<PB N="108" REF="023370_0107_0FBF37344DD317D0">
and &s;oon came to a large water, which filling the whole road, he &s;aw no method of pa&s;&s;ing unle&s;s by wading through, which he accordingly did up to his middle; but was no &s;ooner got on the other &s;ide, than he perceived, if he had looked over the hedge, he would have found a foot-path capable of con|ducting him without wetting his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P>His &s;urprize at Jo&s;eph's not coming up grew now very trouble&s;ome: he began to fear he knew not what; and as he determined to move no far|ther, and if he did not &s;hortly overtake him, to re|turn back, he wi&s;hed to find a hou&s;e of publick en|tertainment where he might dry <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> clothes, and re|fre&s;h him&s;elf with a pint: but &s;eeing not &s;uch, for no other rea&s;on than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> he did not ca&s;t his eyes a hundred yards forwards he &s;at him&s;elf down on a &s;tile, and pulled out his AE&s;chylus.</P>
<P>A fellow pa&s;&s;ing pre&s;ently by, Adams a&s;ked him, if he could direct him to an ale-hou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e. The fel|low, who had ju&s;t left it, and perceived the hou&s;e and &s;ign to be within &s;ight, thinking he had jeered him, and being of a moro&s;e temper, bad him f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">llow his no&s;e and be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d&mdash;n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d. Adams told him he was a &s;aucy jackanapes; upon which the fellow turned about angrily: but perceiving Adams clench his fi&s;t, he thought proper to go on without taking any farther notice.</P>
<P>A hor&s;eman following immediately after, and be|ing a&s;ked the &s;ame que&s;tion, an&s;wered, Friend, there is one within a &s;tone's-throw; I believe you may &s;ee it before you. Adams, lifting up his eyes, cried, I prote&s;t and &s;o there is: and, thanking his informer, proceeded directly to it.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The opinion of two lawyers concerning the &s;ame gen|tleman, with Mr. Adams's enquiry into the religion of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>HE had ju&s;t entered the hou&s;e, had called for his pint, and &s;eated him&s;elf, when two hor&s;emen came to the door, and fa&s;tening their hor&s;es to the rails, alighted. They &s;aid there was a violent &s;how|er of rain coming on, which they intended to wea|ther there, and went into a little room by them|&s;elves, not perceiving Mr. Adams.</P>
<P>One of the&s;e immediately a&s;ked the other, if he had &s;een a more comical adventure a great while? Upon which the other &s;aid, <Q>he doubted whether by law, the landlord could ju&s;tify detaining the hor&s;e for his corn and hay.</Q> But the former an&s;wered, <Q>undoubtedly he can; it is an adjudged ca&s;e, and I have known it tried.</Q></P>
<P>Adams, who tho' he was, as the reader may &s;u&s;|pect, a little inclined to forgetfulne&s;s, never want|ed more than a hint to remind him, over-hearing their di&s;cour&s;e, immediately &s;ugge&s;ted to him&s;elf that this was his own hor&s;e, and that he had for|got to pay for him, which, upon enquiry, he was certified of by the gentlemen; who added, that the hor&s;e was likely to have more re&s;t than food, un|le&s;s he was paid for.</P>
<P>The poor par&s;on re&s;olved to return pre&s;ently to the inn, tho' he knew no more than Jo&s;eph, how to procure his hor&s;e his liberty: he was however prevailed on to &s;tay under cover, 'till the &s;hower, which was now very violent, was over.</P>
<P>The three travellers then &s;at down together over
<PB N="110" REF="023370_0109_0FBF373A7A7EF9C0">
a mug of good beer; when Adams, who had ob|&s;erved a gentleman's hou&s;e as he pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed along the road, enquired to whom it belonged: one of the hor&s;emen had no &s;ooner mentioned the owner's name, than the other began to revile him in the mo&s;t opprobrio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s terms. The Engli&s;h language &s;carce affords a &s;ingle reproachful word, which he did not vent on this occa&s;ion. He charged him likewi&s;e with many particular facts. He &s;aid,&mdash;<Q>he no more regarded a field of wheat when he was hunting, than he did the highway; that he had injured &s;everal poor farmers by trampling their corn under his hor&s;e's heels; and if any of them begged him with the utmo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to refrain, his hor&s;e whip was always ready to do them ju&s;tice.</Q> He &s;aid, <Q>that he was the greate&s;t tyrant to the neighbours in every other in&s;tance, and would not &s;uffer a farmer to keep a gun, tho' he might ju&s;tify it by law; and in his own family &s;o cruel a ma&s;ter, that he never kept a &s;ervant a twelvemonth. In his capacity as a ju&s;tice,</Q> continued he, <Q>he behaves &s;o partially, that he commits or acquits ju&s;t as he is in the hu|mour, without any regard to truth or evidence: the devil may carry any one before him for me; I would rather be tried before &s;ome judges than be a pro&s;ecutor before him: if I had an e&s;tate in the neighbourhood&punc; I would &s;ell it for half the value, rather than live near him.</Q></P>
<P>Adams &s;hook his head, and &s;aid, <Q>he was &s;orry &s;uch men were &s;uffered to proceed with impu|nity, and that riches could &s;et any man above law.</Q> The reviler a little after retiring into the yard, the gentleman who had fir&s;t mentioned his name to Adams, began to a&s;&s;ure him, <Q>that his companion was a prejudiced per&s;on. It is true,
<PB N="111" REF="023370_0110_0FBF373BD14543C0">
&s;ays he, perhaps, that he may have &s;ometimes pur&s;ued his game over a field of corn, but he hath always made the party ample &s;atisfaction; that &s;o far from tyrannizing over his neighbours, or taking away their guns, he him&s;elf knew &s;eve|ral farmers not qualified, who not only kept guns, but killed game with them. That he was the be&s;t of ma&s;ters to his &s;ervants, and &s;everal of them had grown old in his &s;ervice. That he was the be&s;t ju&s;tice of peace in the kingdom, and to his certain knowledge, had decided many dif|ficult points, which were referred to him, with the greate&s;t equity, and the highe&s;t wi&s;dom. And he verily believed, &s;everal per&s;ons would give a year's purcha&s;e more for an e&s;tate near him, than under the wings of any other great man.</Q> He had ju&s;t fini&s;hed his encomium, when his companion returned, and acquainted him the &s;torm was over. Upon which, they pre|&s;ently mounted their hor&s;es and departed.</P>
<P>Adams, who was in the utmo&s;t anxiety at tho&s;e different characters of the &s;ame per&s;on, a&s;ked his ho&s;t if he know the gentleman: for he began to imagine they had by mi&s;take been &s;peaking of two &s;everal gentlemen. 'No, no, ma&s;ter!' an|&s;wered the ho&s;t, a &s;hrewd cunning fellow, <Q>I know the gentlemen very well of whom they have been &s;peaking, as I do the gentleman who &s;poke of him. As for riding over other mens corn, to my knowledge he hath not been on hor&s;eback the&s;e two years. I never heard he did any injury of that kind; and as to making re|paration, he is not &s;o free of his money as that comes to neither. Nor did I ever hear of his taking away any man's gun; nay, I know &s;eve|ral who have guns in their hou&s;es: but as for
<PB N="112" REF="023370_0111_0FBF374068B3EFE8">
killing game with them, no man is &s;tricter; and I believe he would ruin any who did. You heard one of the gentlemen &s;ay, he was the wor&s;t ma&s;ter in the world, and the other that he is the be&s;t: but for my own part, I know all his &s;er|vants, and never heard from any of them that he was either one or the other.&mdash;</Q> 'Aye! aye!' &s;ays Adams. <Q>and how doth he behave as a ju&s;tice, pray&punc;</Q> 'Faith, Friend,' an&s;wered the ho&s;t, <Q>I que&s;tion whether he is in the commi&s;&s;ion: the only cau&s;e I have heard he hath decided a great while, was one between tho&s;e very two per&s;ons who ju&s;t went out of this hou&s;e; and I am &s;ure he determined that ju&s;tly, for I heard the whole matter.</Q> 'Which did he decide it in favour of,' quoth Adams? <Q>I think I need not an&s;wer that que&s;tion,</Q> cried the ho&s;t, <Q>after the different characters you have heard of him. It is not my bu&s;ine&s;s to contradict gentlemen, while they are drinking in my hou&s;e; but I knew neither of them &s;poke a &s;yllable of truth.</Q> 'God forbid!' (&s;aid Adams) <Q>that men &s;hould arrive at &s;uch a pitch of wickedne&s;s to belye the character of their neighbour from a little private affection, or, what is infinitely wor&s;e, a private &s;pite. I ra|ther believe we have mi&s;taken them, and they mean two other per&s;ons: for there are many hou&s;es on the road.</Q> 'Why prithee, friend,' cries the ho&s;t, <Q>do&s;t thou pretend never to have told a lye in thy life?</Q> <Q>Never a malicious one, I am certain,</Q> an&s;wered Adams; <Q>nor with a de|&s;ign to injure the reputation of any man living.</Q> 'Pugh! malicious; no, no,' replied the ho&s;t; <Q>not malicious with a de&s;ign to hang a man, or bring him into trouble; but &s;urely out of love to one's &s;elf, one mu&s;t &s;peak better of a friend than

an enemy.</Q> <Q>Out of love to your&s;elf! you &s;hould confine your&s;elf to truth,</Q> &s;ays Adams, <Q>for by doing otherwi&s;e, you injure the noble&s;t part of your&s;elf, your immortal &s;oul. I can hardly believe any man &s;uch an ideot to ri&s;que the lo&s;s of that by any trifling gain, and the greate&s;t gain in this world is but dirt in compa|ri&s;on of what &s;hall be revealed hereafter.</Q> Up|on which the ho&s;t, taking up the cup, with a &s;mile, drank a health to Hereafter: adding, he was for &s;omething pre&s;ent. 'Why,' &s;ays Adams very gravely, 'Do not you believe another world?' To which the ho&s;t an&s;wered, <Q>yes, he was no athei&s;t.</Q> <Q>And you believe you have an immor|tal &s;oul,</Q> cries Adams. He an&s;wered, <Q>God forbid he &s;hould not.</Q> 'And heaven and hell?' &s;aid the par&s;on.' The ho&s;t then bid him <Q>not to profane; for tho&s;e were things not to be men|tioned nor thought of but in church.</Q> Adams a&s;ked him, <Q>why he went to church, if what he learned there had no influence on his conduct in life?</Q> 'I go to church,' an&s;wered the ho&s;t, 'to &s;ay my prayers and behave godly.' <Q>And do&s;t not thou,</Q> cried Adams, <Q>believe what thou heare&s;t at church?</Q> 'Mo&s;t part of it, ma&s;ter,' returned the ho&s;t. <Q>And doth not thou then trem|ble,</Q> cries Adams, <Q>at the thought of eternal pu|ni&s;hment?</Q> 'As for that, ma&s;ter,' &s;aid he, <Q>I never once thought about it: but what &s;ignifies talking about matters &s;o far off? The mug is out, &s;hall I draw another?</Q></P>
<P>Whil&s;t he was going for that purpo&s;e, a &s;tage-coach drove up to the door. The coach-man com|ing into the hou&s;e, was a&s;ked by the mi&s;tre&s;s, what pa&s;&s;engers he had in his coach? A parcel of &s;quin|ny-gut b&mdash;s, (&s;ays he) I have a good mind to over|turn

Her's indeed was not &s;o great, becau&s;e &s;he had been informed by Jo&s;eph, that he was on the road. Very civil were the &s;alutations on both &s;ides; and Mrs. Slip&s;lop rebuked the ho&s;t|e&s;s for denying the gentleman to be there when &s;he a&s;ked for him. But indeed the poor woman had not erred de&s;ignedly: for Mrs. Slip&s;lop a&s;ked for a clergyman; and &s;he had unhappily mi&s;taken Adams for a per&s;on travelling to a neighbouring fair with the thimble and button, or &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">me other &s;uch operati|on: for he marched in a &s;winging great, but &s;hort, white coat with black buttons, a &s;hort wig, and a hat, which &s;o far from having a black hatband, had nothing black about it.</P>
<P>Jo&s;eph was now come up, and Mrs. Slip&s;lop would have had him quit his hor&s;e to the par&s;on and come him&s;elf into the coach: but he ab&s;olutely re|fu&s;ed, &s;aving, he thanked heaven he was well enough recovered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> be very able to ride, and added, he hoped he knew his duty better than to ride in a coach, while Mr. Adams was on hor&s;eback.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The hi&s;tory of Leonora, or the unfortunate jilt.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>LEONORA was the daughter of a gentleman of fortune; &s;he was tall and well-&s;haped, with a &s;prightline&s;s in her countenance, which often at|tracts beyond more regular features joined with an in&s;ipid air; nor is this kind of beauty le&s;s apt to de|ceive than allure the good humour which it indi|cates, being often mi&s;taken for good-nature, and the vivacity for true under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>Leonora, who was now at the age of eighteen, lived with an aunt of her's in a town in the north of England. She was an extreme lover of gaiety; and very rarely mi&s;&s;ed a ball, or any other publick a&s;|&s;embly; where &s;he had frequently opportunities of &s;atisfying a greedy appetite of vanity with the pre|ference which was given her by the men to almo&s;t every other woman pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Among many young fellows who were particular in their gallantries towards her, Horatio &s;oon di&s;|tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in her eyes beyond all his compe|titors; &s;he danced with more than ordinary gaiety when he happened to be her partner; neither the fairne&s;s of the evening nor the mu&s;ick of the night|ingale, could lengthen her walk like his company. She affected no longer to under&s;tand the civilities of others: whil&s;t &s;he inclined &s;o attentive an air to e|very compliment of Horatio, that &s;he often &s;miled even when it was too delicate for her comprehen&s;i|on.</P>
<P>'Pray, Madam,' &s;ays Adams, 'who was this &s;quire Horatio?'</P>
<P>Horatio, &s;ays the lady, was a young gentleman of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="118" REF="023370_0117_0FBF37502A68EB18">
a good family bred to the law, and had been &s;ome few years called to the degree of a barri&s;ter. His face and per&s;on were &s;uch as the generality allowed hand&s;ome: but he had a dignity in his air very rare|ly to be &s;een. His temper was of the &s;aturnine complexion, and without the lea&s;t taint of moro&s;e|ne&s;s. He had wit and humour, with an inclinati|on to &s;atire, which he indulged rather too much.</P>
<P>This gentleman, who had contracted the mo&s;t violent pa&s;&s;ion for Leonora, was the la&s;t per&s;on who perceived the probability of its &s;ucce&s;s. The whole town had made the match for him, before he him|&s;elf had drawn a confidence from her actions &s;uffi|cient to mention his pa&s;&s;ion to her; for it was his opinion, and perhaps he was there in the right) that it is highly impoli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ck to talk &s;eriou&s;ly of love to a woman before you have made &s;uch a progre&s;s in her affections, that &s;he her&s;elf expects and de&s;ires to hear it.</P>
<P>But whatever diffidence the fears of a lover may create, which are apt to magnify every favour con|ferred on a rival, and to &s;ee the little advances to|wards them&s;elves through the other end of the per|&s;pective; it was impo&s;&s;ible that Horatio's pa&s;&s;ion &s;hould &s;o blind his di&s;cernment, as to prevent his conceiving hopes from the behaviour of Leonora, who&s;e fondne&s;s for him was now as vi&s;ible to an in|different per&s;on in their company, as his for her.</P>
<P><Q>I never knew any of the&s;e forward &s;luts come to good,</Q> (&s;ays the lady, who refu&s;ed Jo&s;eph's en|trance into the coach) <Q>nor &s;hall I wonder at any thing &s;he doth in the &s;equel.</Q></P>
<P>The lady proceeded in her &s;tory thus: it was in the mid&s;t of a gay conver&s;ation in the walks one evening, when Horatio whi&s;pered Leonora, that he was de&s;irous to take a turn or two with her in pri|vate;
<PB N="119" REF="023370_0118_0FBF3757BA02FF78">
for that he had &s;omething to communicate to her of great con&s;equence. <Q>Are you &s;ure it is of con&s;equence? &s;aid &s;he &s;miling&mdash;</Q> I hope, an&s;wer|ed he, <Q>you will think &s;o too, &s;ince the whole fu|ture happine&s;s of my life mu&s;t depend on the e|vent.</Q></P>
<P>Leonora, who very much &s;u&s;pected what was coming, would have deferred it till another time: but Horatio, who had more than half conquered the difficulty of &s;peaking, by the fir&s;t motion, was &s;o very importunate, that &s;he at la&s;t yielded, and leav|ing the re&s;t of the company, they turned a&s;ide into an unfrequented walk.</P>
<P>They had retired far out of the &s;ight of the company, both maintaining a &s;trict &s;ilence. At la&s;t Horatio made a full &s;top, and taking Leonora, who &s;tood pale and trembling, gently by the hand, he fetched a deep &s;igh, and then looking on her eyes with all the tenderne&s;s imaginable, he cried out in a faltering accent; <Q>O Leonora! it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary for me to declare to you on what the fu|ture happine&s;s of my life mu&s;t be founded! Mu&s;t I &s;ay, there is &s;omething belonging to you which is a bar to my happine&s;s, and which unle&s;s you will part with, I mu&s;t be mi&s;erable?</Q> <Q>What can that be,</Q> replied Leonora?&mdash;'No wonder,' &s;aid he, <Q>you are &s;urprized that I &s;hould make an objection to any thing which is yours, yet &s;ure you may gue&s;s, &s;ince it is the only one which the riches of the world, if they were mine, &s;hould purcha&s;e of me&mdash;Oh it is that which you mu&s;t part with, to be&s;tow all the re&s;t! Can Leonora, or rather will &s;he, doubt longer?&mdash;Let me then whi&s;per it in her ears,&mdash;It is your name, Ma|dam. It is by parting with that, by your con|de&s;cen&s;ion to be for ever mine, which mu&s;t at

once prevent me from being the mo&s;t mi&s;erable, and will render me the happie&s;t of mankind.</Q></P>
<P>Leonora, covered with blu&s;hes, and with as an|gry a look as &s;he could po&s;&s;ibly put on, told him, <Q>that had &s;he &s;u&s;pected what his declaration would have been, he &s;hould not have decoyed her from her company; that he had &s;o &s;urprized and frighted her, that &s;he begged him to convey her back as quick as po&s;&s;ible;</Q> which he, trembling very near as much as her&s;elf, did.</P>
<P><Q>More fool he, cried Slip&s;lop, it is a &s;ign he knew very little of our &s;ect.</Q> 'Truly, madam,' &s;aid Adams, <Q>I think you are in the right, I &s;hould have in&s;i&s;ted to know a piece of her mind, when I had carried matters &s;o far.</Q> But Mrs. Grave|airs de&s;ired the lady to omit all &s;uch ful&s;ome &s;tuff in her &s;tory; for that it made her &s;ick.</P>
<P>Well then, Madam, to be as conci&s;e as po&s;&s;ible, &s;aid the lady, many weeks had not pa&s;s'd after this interview, before Horatio and Leonora were what they call on a good footing together. All ceremo|nies except the la&s;t were now over: the writings were now drawn, and every thing was in the ut|mo&s;t forwardne&s;s preparative to the putting Hora|tio in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all his wi&s;hes. I will, if you plea&s;e, repeat you a letter from each of them which I have got by heart, and which will give you no &s;mall idea of their pa&s;&s;ion on both &s;ides.</P>
<P>Mrs. Grave-airs objected to hearing the&s;e let|ters: but being put to the vote, it was carried a|gain&s;t her by all the re&s;t in the coach; par&s;on A|dams contending for it with the utmo&s;t vehe|mence.</P>

<P>HOW vain, mo&s;t adorable creature, is the pur&s;uit of plea&s;ure in the ab&s;ence of an object to which the mind is entirely devoted, unle&s;s it have &s;ome relation to that object! I was la&s;t night condemned to the &s;ociety of men of wit and learning, which, however agreeable it might have formerly been to me, now only gave me a &s;u&s;picion that they imputed my ab|&s;ence in conver&s;ation to the true cau&s;e. For which rea&s;on, when your engagements forbad me the extatic happine&s;s of &s;eeing you, I am al|ways de&s;irous to be alone; &s;ince my &s;entiments for Leonora are &s;o delicate, that I cannot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the apprehen&s;ion of another's prying into tho&s;e delightful endearments with which the warm imagination of a lover will &s;ometimes indulge him, and which I &s;u&s;pect my eyes then betray.

And &s;urely we &s;hall &s;u&s;pect there are few &s;uch, when we con&s;ider that it requires every human virtue, to exert it&s;elf in its full ex|tent. Since the beloved, who&s;e happine&s;s it ultimately re&s;pects, may give us charming op|portunities of being brave in her defence, gene|rous to her wants, compa&s;&s;ionate to her afflicti|ons, grateful to her kindne&s;s; and, in the &s;ame manner, of exerci&s;ing every other virtue, which he who would not do to any degree, and that with the utmo&s;t rapture, can never de&s;erve the name of a lover: It is therefore with the view to the delicate mode&s;ty of your mind that I cul|tivate

<P>Matters were in &s;o great forwardne&s;s between this fond couple, that the day was fixed for their marriage, and was now within a fortnight, when the &s;e&s;&s;ions chanced to be held for that county in a town about twenty miles di&s;tance from that which
<PB N="124" REF="023370_0123_0FBF37674FD62F18">
is the &s;cene of our &s;tory. It &s;eems it is u&s;ual for the young gentlemen of the bar to repair to the&s;e &s;e&s;|&s;ions, not &s;o much for the &s;ake of profit, as to &s;hew their parts, and learn the law of the ju&s;tices of peace: for which purpo&s;e one of the wi&s;e&s;t and grave&s;t of all the ju&s;tices is appointed &s;peaker or chairman, as they mode&s;tly call it, and he reads them a lecture, and in&s;tructs them in the true knowledge of the law.</P>
<P><Q>You are here guilty of a little mi&s;take, &s;ays A|dams, which, if you plea&s;e, I will correct; I have attended at one of the&s;e quarter-&s;e&s;&s;ions, where I ob&s;erved the coun&s;el taught the ju&s;tices, in&s;tead of learning any thing of them.</Q></P>
<P>It is not very material, &s;aid the lady. Hither re|paired Horatio, who as he hoped by his profe&s;&s;ion to advance his fortune, which was not at pre&s;ent very large, for the &s;ake of his dear Leonora, he re&s;olved to &s;pare no pains, nor lo&s;e any opportunity of im|proving or advancing him&s;elf in it.</P>
<P>The &s;ame afternoon in which he left the town, as Leonora &s;tood at her window, a coach and &s;ix pa&s;|&s;ed by: which &s;he declared to be the compleate&s;t, genteele&s;t, prettie&s;t equipage &s;he ever &s;aw; adding the&s;e remarkable words, <Q>O I am in love with that equipage!</Q> which, tho' her friend Florella at that time did not greatly regard, &s;he hath &s;ince remem|bered.</P>
<P>In the evening an a&s;&s;embly was held, which Le|onora honoured with her company: but intended to pay her dear Horatio the compliment of refu&s;ing to dance in his ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>O why have not women as good re&s;olution to maintain their vows, as they have often good incli|nations in making them!</P>
<P>The gentleman who owned the coach and &s;ix
<PB N="125" REF="023370_0124_0FBF376D6D304C60">
came to the a&s;&s;embly. His clothes were as remark|ably fine as his equipage could be. He &s;oon at|tracted the eyes of the company; all the &s;marts, all the &s;ilk wai&s;tcoats with &s;ilver and gold edgings, were eclip&s;ed in an in&s;tant.</P>
<P><Q>Madam, &s;aid Adams, if it be not impertinent, I &s;hould be glad to know how this gentleman was dre&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>Sir, an&s;wered the lady, I have been told he had on a cut-velvet coat of a cinnamon colour, lined with a pink &s;atten, embroidered all over with gold: his wai&s;tcoat, which was cloth of &s;ilver, was em-broidered with gold likewi&s;e. I cannot be parti|cular as to the re&s;t of his dre&s;s: but it was all in the French fa&s;hion; for Bellarmine (that was his name) was ju&s;t arrived from Paris.</P>
<P>This fine figure did not more engage the eyes of every lady in the a&s;&s;embly, than Leonora did his. He had &s;carce beheld her, but he &s;tood motionle&s;s and fixed as a &s;tatue, or at lea&s;t would have done &s;o, if good breeding had permitted him. However, he carried it &s;o far, before he had power to correct him&s;elf, that every per&s;on in the room ea&s;ily di&s;|covered where his admiration was &s;ettled. The o|ther ladies began to &s;ingle out their former partners, all perceiving who would be Bellarmine's choice; which they however endeavoured, by all po&s;&s;ible means, to prevent: Many of them &s;aying to Leo|nora, <Q>O, Madam, I &s;uppo&s;e we &s;han't have the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing you dance to-night;</Q> and then crying out, in Bellarmine's hearing, <Q>O Leonora will not dance, I a&s;&s;ure you; her partner is not here.</Q> One maliciou&s;ly attempted to prevent her, by &s;ending a di&s;agreeable fellow to a&s;k her, that &s;o &s;he might be obliged either to dance with him, or &s;it down: but this &s;cheme proved abortive.</P>

Leonora &s;aw her&s;elf admired by the fine &s;tranger, and envied by every woman pre&s;ent. Her little heart began to flutter within her, and her head was agitated with a convul&s;ive motion; &s;he &s;eemed as if &s;he would &s;peak to &s;everal of her acquaintance, but had nothing to &s;ay: for as &s;he would not mention her pre&s;ent triumph; &s;o &s;he could not di&s;engage her thoughts one moment from the contemplation of it: &s;he had never ta&s;ted any thing like this happine&s;s. She had before known what it was to torment a &s;in|gle woman; but to be hated and &s;ecretly cur&s;ed by a whole a&s;&s;embly, was a joy re&s;erved for this ble&s;&s;ed moment. As this va&s;t profu&s;ion of ec&s;tacy had confounded her un&s;ter&s;tanding; &s;o there was no|thing &s;o fooli&s;h as her behaviour; &s;he played a thou|&s;and childi&s;h tricks, di&s;torted her per&s;on into &s;eve|ral &s;hapes, and her face into &s;everal laughs, without any rea&s;on. In a word, her carriage was as ab&s;urd as her de&s;ires, which were, to affect an in&s;en&s;ibility of the &s;tranger's admiration, and at that &s;ame time a triumph, from that admiration, over every wo|man in the room.</P>
<P>In this temper of mind, Bellarmine, having en|quired who &s;he was, advanced to her, and with a low bow begged the honour of dancing with her, which &s;he with a low curt'&s;y immediately granted. She danced with him all night, and enjoyed perhaps the highe&s;t plea&s;ure that &s;he was capable of feeling.</P>
<P>At the&s;e words Adams fetched a deep groan, which frighted the ladies, who told him, <Q>they hop|ed he was not ill.</Q> He an&s;wered <Q>he groaned on|ly for the folly of Leonora.</Q></P>
<P>Leonora retired (continued the lady) about &s;ix in the morning, but not to re&s;t. She tumbled and to&s;|&s;ed in her bed, with very &s;hort intervals of &s;leep, and tho&s;e entirely filled with dreams of the equipage,
<PB N="127" REF="023370_0126_0FBF3771EDCF6AC0">
and fine clothes &s;he had &s;een, and the balls, operas, and ridottos, which had been the &s;ubject of their conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>In the afternoon, Bellarmine, in the dear coach and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ix, came to wait on her. He was indeed charmed with her per&s;on, and was, on enquiry, &s;o well plea&s;ed with the circum&s;tances of her father (for he him&s;elf, notwith&s;tanding all his finery, was not quite &s;o rich as Croe&s;us or an Attalus) 'Attalus,' &s;ays Mr. Adams: <Q>but pray how came you ac|quainted with the&s;e names?</Q> The lady &s;miled at the que&s;tion and proceeded&mdash;He was &s;o plea&s;ed I &s;ay, that he re&s;olved to make his addre&s;&s;es to her di|rectly. He did &s;o accordingly, and that with &s;o much warmth and bri&s;kne&s;s, that he quickly baffled her weak repul&s;es, and obliged the lady to refer him to her father, who, &s;he knew, would quickly de|clare in favour of a coach and &s;ix.</P>
<P>Thus, what Horatio had by &s;ighs and tears, love and tenderne&s;s, been &s;o long obtaining, the French-Engli&s;h Bellarmine with gaiety and gallantry po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of in an in&s;tant. In other words, what mode&s;ty had employed a full year in rai&s;ing, impudence demoli&s;hed in twenty-four hours.</P>
<P>Here Adams groaned a &s;econd time; but the la|dies, who began to &s;moak him, took no notice.</P>
<P>From the opening of the a&s;&s;embly till the end of Bellarmine's vi&s;it, Leonora had &s;carce once thought of Horatio; but he now began, though an unwel|come gue&s;t, to enter into her mind. She wi&s;hed &s;he had &s;een the charming Bellarmine and his charm|ing equipage, before matters had gone &s;o far. <Q>Yet why (&s;ays &s;he) &s;hould I wi&s;h to have &s;een him be|fore; or what &s;ignifies it that I have &s;een him now? Is not Horatio my lover? almo&s;t my hu&s;|band? Is he not as hand&s;ome, nay hand&s;omer,

than Bellarmine? Aye, but Bellarmine is the gen|teeler and the finer man; yes, that he mu&s;t be al|lowed. Yes, yes, he is that certainly. But did not I no longer than ye&s;terday love Horatio more than all the world? Aye, but ye&s;terday I had not &s;een Bellarmine. But doth not Horatio doat on me, and may he not in de&s;pair break his heart if I abandon him? Well, and hath not Bellarmine a heart to break too? Yes, but I promi&s;ed Horatio fir&s;t; but that was poor Bellarmine's misfortune; if I had &s;een him fir&s;t, I &s;hould certainly have pre|ferred him. Did not the dear creature prefer me to every woman in the a&s;&s;embly, when every She was laying out for him? When was it in Horatio's power to give me &s;uch an in&s;tance of affection? Can he give me an equipage, or any of tho&s;e things which Bellarmine will make me mi&s;tre&s;s of? How va&s;t is the difference between being the wife of a poor coun&s;ellor, and the wife of one of Bellarmine's fortune! If I marry Horatio, I &s;hall triumph over no more than one rival: but by mar|rying Bellarmine, I &s;hall be the envy of all my ac|quaintance.

<P>The next morning Bellarmine breakfa&s;ted with her in pre&s;ence of her aunt, whom her &s;ufficiently in|formed of his pa&s;&s;ion for Leonora: he was no &s;oon|er withdrawn, than the old lady began to advi&s;e her niece on this occa&s;ion&mdash;<Q>You &s;ee, child, (&s;ays &s;he) what fortune hath thrown in your way; and I

Leonora was at length &s;atisfied with her aunt's rea&s;oning; and, Bellarmine &s;upping with her that evening, it was agreed he &s;hould the next morning go to her father and propo&s;e the match, which &s;he con&s;ented &s;hould be con&s;ummated at his return.</P>
<P>The aunt retired &s;oon after &s;upper, and the lo|vers being left together, Bellarmine began in the following manner: <Q>Yes, Madam, this coat I a&s;|&s;ure you was made at Paris, and I defy the be&s;t Engli&s;h taylor even to imitate it. There is not one of them can cut, Madam, they can't cut. If you ob&s;erve how this &s;kirt is turned, and this &s;leeve, a clum&s;y Engli&s;h ra&s;cal can do nothing like it.&mdash;Pray how do you like my liveries?</Q> Leonora an&s;wered, '&s;he thought them very pretty.' <Q>All French,</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>I a&s;&s;ure you, except the great coats; I never tru&s;t any thing more than a great coat to an Engli&s;hman; you know one mu&s;t en|courage our own people what one can, e&s;pecially as, before I had a place, I was in the country intere&s;t, he, he, he! but for my&s;elf, I would &s;ee the dirty i&s;land at the bottom of the &s;ea, rather than wear a &s;ingle rag of Engli&s;h work about me; and I am &s;ure after you have made one tour to Paris, you will be of the &s;ame opinion with re|gard to your own clothes.

<P>With &s;uch &s;ort of polite di&s;cour&s;e did the gay Bellarmine entertain his beloved Leonora, when the door opened on a &s;udden, and Horatio entered the room. Here 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s the &s;ur|prize of Leonora.</P>

Horatio de&s;ired Bellarmine to withdraw with him: but the ladies prevented it, by laying violent hands on the latter; upon which, the former took his leave without any great ceremony, and departed, leaving the lady with his rival to con&s;ult for his &s;afety, which Leonora feared her indi&s;cretion might have endangered: but the aunt comforted her with a&s;&s;urances, that Horatio would not venture his per&s;on again&s;t &s;o accompli&s;hed a cavalier as Bel|larmine; and that, being a lawyer, he would &s;eek revenge in his own way, and the mo&s;t they had to apprehend from him was an action.</P>
<P>They at length therefore agreed to permit Bel|larmine to retire to his lodgings, having fir&s;t &s;ettled all matters relating to the journey which he was to undertake in the morning, and their prepara|tions for the nuptials at his return.</P>

foible however was of no great inconvenience to the par&s;on, who was accu&s;tomed to it, and as his legs almo&s;t touched the ground when he be&s;trode the bea&s;t, had but a little way to fall, and threw him&s;elf forward on &s;uch occa&s;ions with &s;o much dexterity, that he never received any mi&s;chief? the hor&s;e and he frequently rolling many paces di&s;tance, and af|terwards both getting up and meeting as good friends as ever.</P>
<P>Poor Jo&s;eph, who had not been u&s;ed to &s;uch kind of cattle, though an excellent hor&s;eman, did not &s;o happily di&s;engage him&s;elf; but falling with his leg under the bea&s;t, received a violent contu&s;ion, to which the good woman was, as we have &s;aid, apply|ing a warm hand, with &s;ome camphorated &s;pirits, ju&s;t at the time when the par&s;on entered the kit|chen.</P>
<P>He had &s;carce expre&s;&s;ed his concern for Jo&s;eph's misfortune, before the ho&s;t likewi&s;e entered. He was by no means of Mr. Tow-wou&s;e's gentle di&s;|po&s;ition, and was indeed perfectly ma&s;ter of his hou&s;e, and every thing in it but his gue&s;ts.</P>
<P>This &s;urly fellow, who always proportioned his re&s;pect to the appearance of a traveller, from God ble&s;s your honour, down to plain coming pre&s;ent|ly, ob&s;erving his wife on her knees to a footman, cried out without con&s;idering his circum&s;tances, <Q>What a pox is the woman about? why don't you mind the company in the coach? Go and a&s;k them what they will have for dinner?</Q> 'My dear,' &s;ays &s;he, you know they can have nothing <Q>but what is at the fire, which will be ready pre|&s;ently; and really the poor young man's leg is very much brui&s;ed.</Q> At which words, &s;he fell to chafing more violently than before: the bell then happening to ring, he damn'd his wife, and
<PB N="139" REF="023370_0138_0FBF3792CA113D70">
bid her go into the company, and not &s;tand rub|bing there all day: for he did not believe the young fellow's leg was &s;o bad as he pretended; and if it was, within twenty miles, he would find a &s;urge|on to cut it off. Upon the&s;e words, Adams fetch|ed two &s;trides acro&s;s the room; and &s;napping his fingers over his head, muttered aloud&punc; He would excommunicate &s;uch a wretch for a farthing; for he believed the devil had more humanity. The&s;e words occa&s;ioned a dialogue between Adams and the ho&s;t, in which there were two or three &s;harp replies, till Jo&s;eph bade the latter know how to behave him&s;elf to his betters. At which the ho&s;t (having fir&s;t &s;trictly &s;urveyed Adams) &s;cornfully repeating the word betters, flew into a rage, and telling Jo&s;eph he was as able to walk out of his hou&s;e as he had been to walk into it, offered to lay violent hands on him; which Adams perceiving, dealt him &s;o &s;ound a compliment over his face with his fi&s;t, that the blood immediately gu&s;hed out of his no&s;e in a &s;tream. The ho&s;t being un|willing to be out-done in courte&s;y, e&s;pecially by a per&s;on of Adam's figure, returned the favour with &s;o much gratitude, that the par&s;on's no&s;trils began to look redder than u&s;ual. Upon which he again a&s;&s;ailed his antagoni&s;t, and with another &s;troke laid him &s;prawling on the floor.</P>
<P>The ho&s;te&s;s, who was a better wife than &s;o &s;ur|ly a hu&s;band de&s;erved, &s;eeing her hu&s;band all bloo|dy and &s;tretched along, ha&s;tened pre&s;ently to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, or rather to revenge the blow, which to all appearance, was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t he would ever receive; when lo! a pan <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of hog's-blood, which unluc|kily &s;tood on the dre&s;&s;er, pre&s;ented it&s;elf fir&s;t to her hands. She &s;eized it in her fury, and without any reflection di&s;charged it into the par&s;on's face, and

with &s;o good an aim, that much the greater part fir&s;t &s;aluted his countenance, and trickled thence in &s;o large a current down to his beard, and over his garments, that a more horrible &s;pectacle was hardly to be &s;een, or even imagined. All which was perceived by Mrs. Slip&s;lop, who entered the kitchen at that in&s;tant. This good gentlewoman, not being of a temper &s;o extremely cool and pati|ent as perhaps was required to a&s;k many que&s;ti|ons on this occa&s;ion, flew with great impetuo&s;ity at the ho&s;te&s;s's cap, which, together with &s;ome of her hair, &s;he plucked from her head in a moment, giving her at the &s;ame time &s;everal hearty cuffs in the face, which, by frequent practice on the inferi|or &s;ervants, &s;he had learned an excellent knack of delivering with a good grace. Poor Jo&s;eph could hardly ri&s;e from his chair; the par&s;on was em|ployed in wiping the blood from his eyes, which had entirely blinded him, and the landlord was but ju&s;t beginning to &s;tir, whil&s;t Mrs. Slip&s;lop, holding down the landlady's face with her left hand, made &s;o dexterous an u&s;e of her right, that the poor woman began to roar in a key which alarmed all the company in the inn.</P>
<P>There happened to be in the inn at this time, be&s;ides the ladies who arrived in the &s;tage-coach, the two gentlemen who were pre&s;ent at Mr. Tow-wou&s;e's when Jo&s;eph was detained for his hor&s;e's meat, and whom we have before mentioned to have &s;topped at the ale-hou&s;e with Adams. There was likewi&s;e a gentleman ju&s;t returned from his tra|vels to Italy; all whom the horrid outcry of mur|der pre&s;ently brought into the kitchen, where the &s;everal combatants were found in the po&s;tures al|ready de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">cribed.</P>
<P>It was now no difficulty to put an end to the

fray, the conquerors being &s;atisfied with the ven|geance they had taken, and the conquered having no appetite to renew the fight. The principal figure, and which engaged the eyes of all, was Adams, who was all over covered with blood, which the whole company concluded to be his own; and con&s;equently imagined him no longer for this world. But the ho&s;t, who had now reco|vered from his blow, and was ri&s;en from the ground, &s;oon delivered them from this apprehen|&s;ion, by damning his wife for wa&s;ting the hog's puddings, and telling her all would have been very well, if &s;he had not intermeddled like a b&mdash;as &s;he was; adding, he was very glad the gentlewoman had paid her, though not half what &s;he de&s;erved. The poor woman had indeed fared much the wor&s;t, having, be&s;ides the unmerciful cuffs received, lo&s;t a quantity of hair, which Mrs. Slip&s;lop in triumph held in her left hand.</P>
<P>The traveller, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Mrs. Grave|airs, de&s;ired her not to be frightened; for here had been only a little boxing, which he &s;aid to their <HI>di&s;gracia</HI> the Engli&s;h were <HI>accu&s;tomata</HI> to: adding, it mu&s;t be however a &s;ight &s;omewhat &s;trange to him, who was ju&s;t come from Italy, the Italians not being addicted to the <HI>cuffardo,</HI> but <HI>b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tonza,</HI> &s;ays he. He then went up to Adams, and telling him he looked like the gho&s;t of Othello, bid him not &s;hake his gory locks at him, for he could not &s;ay he did it. Adams very innocently an&s;wered, Sir, I am far from accu&s;ing you.

ho&s;t the occa&s;ion of this bu&s;tle, and being a&s;&s;ured by him that Adams had &s;truck the fir&s;t blow, whi&s;pered in his ear: he'd warrant he would re|cover. 'Recover! ma&s;ter,' &s;aid the ho&s;t &s;miling: <Q>Yes, yes, I am not afraid of dying with a blow or two neither; I am not &s;uch a chicken as that.</Q> Pugh! &s;aid the gentleman, I mean you will recover damages in that action which undoubt|edly you intend to bring as &s;oon as a writ can be returned from London; for you look like a man of too much &s;pirit and courage to &s;uffer any one to beat you without bringing your action again&s;t him: he mu&s;t be a &s;candalous fellow indeed, who would put up a drubbing whil&s;t the law is open to revenge it; be&s;ides he hath drawn blood from you and &s;poiled your coat; and the jury will give da|mages for that too. An excellent new coat upon my word, and now not worth a &s;hilling!</P>
<P>I don't care, continued he, to intermeddle in the&s;e ca&s;es: but you have a right to my evidence; and if I am &s;worn, I mu&s;t &s;peak the truth. I &s;aw you &s;prawling on the floor, and the blood gu&s;hing from your no&s;trils.

That's all.' 'Ma&s;ter,' cry'd the ho&s;t, &s;cratching his head, <Q>I have no &s;tomach to law, I thank you. I have &s;een enough of that in the pari&s;h, where two of my neighbours have been at law about a hou&s;e, till they have both lawed them&s;elves into a goal.</Q> At which word he turn|ed about, and began to enquire again after his hog's puddings; nor would it probably have been a &s;uffi|cient excu&s;e for his wife, that &s;he &s;pilt them in his

Whil&s;t one of the above mentioned gentlemen was employed, as we have &s;een him, on the behalf of the landlord, the other was no le&s;s hearty on the &s;ide of Mr. Adams, whom he advi&s;ed to bring his action immediately.

Adams an&s;wered, if it was true that they were but one per&s;on, he had a&s;&s;aulted the wife; for he was &s;orry to own he had &s;truck the hu&s;band the fir&s;t blow. 'I am &s;orry you own it too,' cries the gen|tleman; <Q>for it could not po&s;&s;ibly appear to the court: for here was no evidence pre&s;ent but the lame man in the chair, whom I &s;uppo&s;e to be your friend, and would con&s;equently &s;ay nothing but what made for you.</Q> 'How, Sir,' &s;ays Adams, <Q>do you take me for a villain, who would pro&s;ecute revenge in cold blood, and u&s;e unju&s;tifiable means to obtain it?

The coachman began now to grow importu|nate with his pa&s;&s;engers, who&s;e entrance into the coach was retarded by Mi&s;s Grave-airs, in&s;i&s;ting again&s;t the remon&s;trance of all the re&s;t, that &s;he would not admit a footman into the coach: for poor Jo&s;eph was too lame to mount a hor&s;e. A young lady, who was, as it &s;eems, an earl's grand|daughter, begged it with almo&s;t tears in her eyes. Mr. Adams prayed, and Mrs. Slip&s;lop &s;colded, but all to no purpo&s;e. She &s;aid <Q>&s;he would not demean her&s;elf to ride with a footman: that there were waggons on the road: that if the ma&s;ter of the coach de&s;ired it, &s;he would pay for two pla|ces: but would &s;uffer no &s;uch fellow to come in.</Q> 'Madam,' &s;ays Slip&s;lop, <Q>I am &s;ure no one can refu&s;e another coming into the &s;tage-coach.</Q> 'I don't know, Madam,' &s;ays the lady, <Q>I am not much u&s;ed to &s;tage-coaches, I &s;eldom travel in them.</Q> 'That may be, Madam,' replied Slip|&s;lop, <Q>very good people do, and &s;ome people's betters, for aught I know.</Q> Mi&s;s Grave-airs &s;aid, <Q>&s;ome folks might &s;ometimes give their tongues a liberty, to &s;ome people that were their betters, which did not become them; for her part, &s;he was not u&s;ed to conver&s;e with &s;ervants.</Q> Slip&s;lop returned, <Q>Some people kept no &s;ervants to con|ver&s;e with; for her part, &s;he thanked heaven &s;he lived in a family where there were great many; and had more under her own command, than any paltry little gentlewoman in the kingdom.</Q> Mi&s;s Grave-airs cried, <Q>&s;he believed her mi&s;tre&s;s would not encourage &s;uch &s;aucine&s;s to her betters.</Q> 'My betters,' &s;ays Slip&s;lop, <Q>who is my betters, pray?</Q> 'I am your betters,' an&s;wered Mi&s;s Grave-airs, 'and I'll acquaint your mi&s;tre&s;s.'&mdash;At which Mrs. Slip&s;lop laughed aloud, and told

her, <Q>her lady was one of the great gentry, and &s;uch little paltry gentlewomen, as &s;ome folks who travelled in &s;tage-coaches, would not ea&s;ily come at her.</Q></P>
<P>This &s;mart dialogue between &s;ome people and &s;ome folks, was going on at the coach door, when a &s;olemn per&s;on riding into the inn, and &s;eeing Mi&s;s Grave-airs, immediately acco&s;ted her with, <Q>Dear child, how do you do? She pre&s;ently an|&s;wered, O! papa, I am glad you have overtaken me.</Q> 'So am I,' an&s;wered he: <Q>for one of our coaches is ju&s;t at hand: and there being room for you in it, you &s;hall go no farther in the &s;tage, un|le&s;s you de&s;ire it.</Q> <Q>How can you imagine I &s;hould de&s;ire it?</Q> &s;ays &s;he; &s;o bidding Slip&s;lop ride with her fellow, if &s;he plea&s;ed, &s;he took her father by the hand, who was ju&s;t alighted, and walked with him into a room.</P>
<P>Adams in&s;tantly a&s;ked the coachman in a whi&s;|per; if he knew who the gentleman was? The coachman an&s;wered, he was now a gentleman, and kept his hor&s;e and man: but times are altered ma&s;ter, &s;aid he; I remember when he was no better born than my&s;elf. Ay! ay! &s;ays Adams. My father drove the &s;quire's coach, an&s;wered he, when that very man rode po&s;tilion: but he is now his &s;teward, and a great gentleman. Adams then &s;napped his fingers, and cried, he thought &s;he was &s;ome &s;uch trollop.</P>
<P>Adams made ha&s;te to acquaint Mrs Slip&s;lop with this good news, as he imagined it; but it found a reception different from what he expected. The prudent gentlewoman who de&s;pi&s;ed the anger of Mi&s;s Grave-airs, whil&s;t &s;he conceived her the daughter of a gentleman of &s;mall fortune, now &s;he heard her alliance with the upper &s;ervants of a great

family in her neighbourhood, began to fear her in|tere&s;t with the mi&s;tre&s;s. She wi&s;hed &s;he had not carried the di&s;pute &s;o far, and began to think of en|deavouring to reconcile her&s;elf to the young lady be|fore &s;he left the inn; when luckily the &s;cene at London, which the reader can &s;carce have forgot|ten, pre&s;ented it&s;elf to her mind, and comforted her with &s;uch a&s;&s;urance, that &s;he no longer apprehended any enemy with her mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Every thing being now adju&s;ted, the company entered the coach which was ju&s;t on its departure, when one lady recollected &s;he had left her fan, a &s;e|cond her gloves, a third a &s;nuff-box, and a fourth a &s;melling bottle behind her; to find all which occa|&s;ioned &s;ome delay, and much &s;wearing, to the coachman.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the coach had left the inn, the women all together fell to the character of Mi&s;s Grave-airs, whom one of them declared &s;he had &s;u&s;pected to be &s;ome low creature from the beginning of their jour|ney; and another affirmed, &s;he had not even the looks of a gentlewoman; a third warranted &s;he was no better than &s;he &s;hould be; and turning to the la|dy who had related the &s;tory in the coach, &s;aid, <Q>Did you ever hear, Madam, any thing &s;o prudi&s;h as her remarks?

<P>LEONORA having once broke through the bounds which cu&s;tom and mode&s;ty impo&s;e on her &s;ex, &s;oon gave an unbridled indulgence to her pa&s;&s;ion. Her vi&s;its to Bellarmine were more con|&s;tant, as well as longer, than his &s;urgeon's; in a word, &s;he became ab&s;olutely his nur&s;e, made his water-gruel, admini&s;tered him his medicines, and, notwith&s;tanding the prudent advice of her aunt to the contrary, almo&s;t entirely re&s;ided in her wound|ed lover's apartment.</P>
<P>The ladies of the town began to take her conduct

under con&s;ideration; it was the chief topic of di&s;|cour&s;e at their tea-tables, and was very &s;everely cen|&s;ured by the mo&s;t part; e&s;pecially by Lindamira, a lady who&s;e di&s;creet and &s;tarch carriage, together with a con&s;tant attendance at church three times a day, had utterly defeated many malicious attacks on her own reputation: for &s;uch was the envy that Lin|damira's virtue had attracted, that, notwith&s;tanding her own &s;trict behaviour and &s;trict enquiry into the lives of others &s;he had not been able to e&s;cape being the mark of &s;ome arrows her&s;elf, which however did her no injury; a ble&s;&s;ing perhaps owned by her to the clergy, who were her chief male companions, and with two or three of whom &s;he had been bar|barou&s;ly and unju&s;tly calumniated.</P>
<P>Not &s;o unju&s;tly neither perhaps, &s;ays Slip&s;lop, for the clergy are men, as well as other folks.</P>
<P>The extreme delicacy of Lindamira's virtue was cruelly hurt by tho&s;e freedoms which Leonor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> allowed her&s;elf: &s;he &s;aid it was an affront to her &s;ex; <Q>that &s;he did not imagine it con&s;i&s;tent with any woman's honour to &s;peak to the creature, or to be &s;een in her company; and that, for her part; &s;he &s;hould always refu&s;e to dance at an a&s;&s;embly with her, for fear of contamination by taking her by the hand.</Q></P>

<P>A little before his arrival, the old gentleman had received an intimation of the affair by the fol|lowing letter; which I can repeat <HI>verbatim,</HI> and which, they &s;ay, was written neither by Leonora

along with him: nor had his children any other &s;ecurity of being his heirs, than that the law would con&s;titute them &s;uch without a will, and that he had not affection enough for any one living to take the trouble of writing one.</P>
<P>To this gentleman came Bellarmine on the er|rand I have mentioned. His per&s;on, his equigage, his family, and his e&s;tate, &s;eemed to the father to make him an advantageous match for his daugh|ter; he therefore very readily accepted his propo|&s;als: but when Bellarmine imagined the princi|pal affair concluded, and began to open the acci|dental matters of fortune; the old gentleman pre|&s;ently changed his countenance, &s;aying, he re&s;olv|ed never <Q>to marry his daughter on a Smithfield match; that whoever had love for her to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> her, would, when he died, find her &s;hare of his fortune in his coffers: but he had &s;een &s;uch ex|amples of undutifulne&s;s happen from the too early genero&s;ity of parents, that he had made a vow never to part with a &s;hilling whil&s;t he lived. He commended the &s;aying of Solomon, He that &s;pare&s;t the rod, &s;poileth the child: but added he might likewi&s;e a&s;&s;erted, that he that &s;pare&s;t the pur&s;e &s;aveth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he child.</Q> He then ran into a di&s;|cour&s;e on the extravagance of the youth of the age; whence he launched into a di&s;&s;ertation on hor&s;es, and came at length to commend tho&s;e Bellarmine drove. That fine gentleman, who, at another &s;ea&s;on would have been well enough plea&s;ed to dwell a little on that &s;ubject, was now very eager to re&s;ume the circum&s;tance of fortune. He &s;aid, he had a very <Q>high value for the young lady, and would receive her with le&s;s than he would any other whatever; but that even his love to her made &s;ome regard to worldly matters nece&s;&s;ary;

<P>In &s;hort, ladies, to keep you no longer in &s;u&s;|pence, Bellarmine having tried every argument and per&s;ua&s;ion which he could invent, and finding them all ineffectual, at length took his leave, but not in order to return to Leonora; he proceeded directly to his own &s;eat, whence, after a few days &s;tay, he returned to Paris, to the great delight of the French, and the honour of the Engli&s;h nation.</P>

<P>I &s;hall not, attempt, ladies, to de&s;cribe Leonora's condition, when &s;he received this letter. It is a picture of horror which I &s;hould have had as little plea&s;ure in drawing, as you in beholding. She im|mediately left the place, where &s;he was the &s;ubject of conver&s;ation and ridicule, and retired to that hou&s;e I &s;hewed you when I began the &s;tory; where &s;he hath ever &s;ince led a di&s;con&s;olate life, and de|&s;erves perhaps pity for her misfortunes, more than our cen&s;ure for a behaviour to which the artifices of her aunt very probably contributed, and to which very young women are often rendered too liable by that blameable levity in the education of our &s;ex.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>A very &s;hort chapter, in which par&s;on Adams <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a great way.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE lady having fini&s;hed her &s;tory, received the thanks of the company; and now Jo&s;eph, putting his head out of the coach, cried out, <Q>Ne|ver believe me, if yonder be not our par&s;on Adams walking along without his hor&s;e.</Q> <Q>On my word, and &s;o he is,</Q> &s;ays Slip&s;lop; <Q>and as &s;ure as two pence he hath left him behind at the inn.</Q> Indeed, true it is, the par&s;on had exhibited a fre&s;h in&s;tance of his ab&s;ence of mind: for he was &s;o plea&s;ed with having got Jo&s;eph into the coach, that he never once thought of the bea&s;t in the &s;table; and finding his legs as nimble as he de&s;ired, he &s;allied out brandi&s;h|ing a crab&s;tick, and had kept on before the coach, mending and &s;lackening his pace occa&s;ionally, &s;o that he had never been much more or le&s;s than a quarter of a mile di&s;tant from it.</P>
<P>Mrs. Slip&s;lop de&s;ired the coachman to overtake him, which he attempted, but in vain: for the fa&s;te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="154" REF="023370_0153_0FBF37B84B3771D8">
he drove, the fa&s;ter ran the par&s;on, often crying out Aye, aye, catch me if you can: till at length the coachman &s;wore he would as &s;oon attempt to drive after a grey-hound; and giving the par&s;on two or three hearty cur&s;es, he cry'd, &s;oftly boys, to his hor&s;es, which the civil bea&s;ts immediately obeyed.</P>
<P>But we will be more courteous to our reader than he was to Mrs. Slip&s;lop; and leaving the coach and its company to pur&s;ue their journey, we will carry our reader on after par&s;on Adams, who &s;tretched forwards without once looking behind him; till having left the coach full three miles in his rear, he came to a place, where by keeping the extreame&s;t tract to the right, it was ju&s;t barely po&s;&s;ible for a human creature to mi&s;s his way. This track how|ever did he keep, as indeed he had a wonderful ca|pacity at the&s;e kind of bare po&s;&s;ibilities; and travel|ling in it about three miles over the plain, he arriv|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> at the &s;ummit of a hill, whence, looking a great way backwards, and perceiving no coach in &s;ight he &s;at him&s;elf down on the turf, and pulling out his AE&s;chylus, &punc;determined to wait there for its arrival.</P>
<P>He had not &s;at long here, before a gun going off very near a little &s;tartled him; he looked up and &s;aw a gentleman within a hundred paces taking up a partridge, which he had ju&s;t &s;hot.</P>
<P>Adams &s;tood up, and pre&s;ented a figure to the gentleman which would have moved laughter i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> many: for his ca&s;&s;ock had ju&s;t again fallen down below his great coat, that is to &s;ay, it reached his knees; whereas the &s;kirts of his coat de&s;cended no lower then half way down his thighs: but the gen|tleman's mirth gave way to his &s;urprize, at behold|ing &s;uch a per&s;onage in &s;uch a place.</P>
<P>Adams advancing to the gentleman, told him he hoped he had good &s;port; to which the other an|&s;wered
<PB N="155" REF="023370_0154_0FBF37BB6D2E5860">
very little. 'I &s;ee, Sir,' &s;ays Adams, <Q>you have &s;mote one partridge:</Q> to which the &s;port&s;|man made no reply, but proceeded to charge his piece.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the gun was charging, Adams remained in &s;ilence, which he at la&s;t broke, by ob&s;erving, that it was a delightful evening. The gentleman, who had at fir&s;t &s;ight conceived a very di&s;ta&s;teful opinion of the par&s;on, began, on perceiving a book in his hand, and &s;moaking likewi&s;e the information of the ca&s;&s;ock, to change his thoughts, and make a &s;mall advance to conver&s;ation on his &s;ide, by &s;aying&punc; Sir, I &s;uppo&s;e you are not one of the&s;e parts?</P>
<P>Adams immediately told him, no: that he was a traveller, and invited by the beauty of the evening and the place to repo&s;e a little, and amu&s;e him&s;elf with reading. 'I may as well repo&s;e my&s;elf too,' &s;aid the &s;port&s;man; <Q>for I have been out this whole afternoon, and the devil a bird have I &s;een till I came hither.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Perhaps then the game is not very plenty here|abouts,</Q> cries Adams. 'No, Sir,' &s;aid the gen|tleman; <Q>the &s;oldiers, who are quartered in the neighbourhood, have killed it all.</Q> <Q>It is very probable,</Q> cries Adams, <Q>for &s;hooting is their profe&s;&s;ion.</Q> 'Ay, &s;hooting th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> game,' an&s;wered the other, <Q>but I don't &s;ee they are &s;o forward to &s;hoot our enemies. I don't like that affair of Carthagena; if I had been there, I believe I &s;hould have done othergue&s;s things, d&mdash;n me; what's a man's life when his country demands it? a man who won't &s;acrifice his life for his country, de&s;erves to be hang'd, d&mdash;n me.</Q> Which words he &s;poke with &s;o violent a ge&s;ture, &s;o loud a voice, &s;o &s;trong an accent, and &s;o fierce a countenance, that he might have frighten'd a

captain of trained bands at the head of his compa|ny; but Mr. Adams was not greatly &s;ubject to fears: he told him intrepidly, that he very much approved his virtue, but di&s;liked his &s;wearing, and begged him not to addict him&s;elf to &s;o bad a cu&s;|tom, without which he &s;aid he might fight as bravely as Achilles did. Indeed he was charmed with this di&s;cour&s;e; he told the gentleman he would willingly have gone many miles to have met a man of his generous way of thinking; that if he plea&s;ed to &s;it down, he &s;hould be greatly de|lighted to commune with him: for tho' he was a clergyman, he would him&s;elf be ready, if there|to called, to lay down his life for his country.</P>
<P>The gentleman &s;at down, and Adams by him; and then the latter began, as in the following chapter, a di&s;cour&s;e which we have placed by it|&s;elf, as it is not only the mo&s;t curious in this, but perhaps in any other book.</P>

<P>A notable di&s;&s;ertation by Mr. Abraham Adams; wherein that gentleman appears in a political light.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><Q>I DO a&s;&s;ure you, Sir, &s;ays he, taking the gen|tleman by the hand, I am heartily glad to meet with a man of your kidney: for tho' I am a poor par&s;on, I will be bold to &s;ay, I am an ho|ne&s;t man, and would not do an ill thing to be made a bi&s;hop: nay, tho' it hath not fallen in my way to offer &s;o noble a &s;acrifice, I have not been without opportunities of &s;uffering for the &s;ake of my con&s;cience, I thank heaven for them; for I have had relations, tho' I &s;ay it, who made &s;ome figure in the world; particularly a nephew,
<PB N="157" REF="023370_0156_0FBF37C062260CD8">
who was a &s;hop-keeper, and an alderman of a corporation. He was a good lad, and was under my care when a boy, and I believe would do what I bade him to his dying day. Indeed, it looks like extreme vanity in me, to affect being a man of &s;uch con&s;equence, as to have &s;o great an inter|e&s;t in an alderman; but others have thought &s;o too, as manife&s;tly appeared by the rector, who&s;e curate I formerly was, &s;ending for me on the ap|proach of an election, and telling me, If I ex|pected to continue in his cure, that I mu&s;t bring my nephew to vote for one colonel Courtley, a gentleman whom I had never heard tidings of till that in&s;tant. I told the rector, I had no power over my nephew's vote, (God forgive me for &s;uch prevarication!) that I &s;uppo&s;ed he would give it according to his con&s;cience; that I would by no means endeavour to influence him to give it otherwi&s;e. He told me, it was in vain to equivocate, that he knew I had already &s;poke to him in favour of e&s;quire Fickle my neighbour; and indeed it was true I had: for it was at a &s;ea&s;on when the church was in danger, and when all good men expected they knew not what would happen to us all. I then an&s;wered bold|ly, If he thought I had given my promi&s;e, he af|fronted me, in propo&s;ing any breach of it. Not to be too prolix: I per&s;evered, and &s;o did my ne|phew, in the e&s;quire's intere&s;t, who was cho&s;e chiefly through his means; and &s;o I lo&s;t my cu|racy. Well, Sir, but do you think the e&s;quire ever mentioned a word of the church? <HI>Ne verbum quidem, ut ita dicam:</HI> within two years he got a place, and hath ever &s;ince lived in London; where I have been informed, (but God forbid I &s;hould believe that) that he never &s;o much as go|eth
<PB N="158" REF="023370_0157_0FBF37C14B204440">
to church. I remained Sir, a con&s;iderable time without any cure, and lived a full month on one funeral &s;ermon, which I preached on the in|di&s;po&s;ition of a clergyman: but this by the bye. At la&s;t, when Mr. Fickle got his place, colonel Courtley &s;tood again; and who &s;hould make in|tere&s;t for him, but Mr. Fickle him&s;elf? that ve|ry identical Mr. Fickle, who had formerly told me, the colonel was an enemy both to the church and &s;tate, had the confidence to &s;ollicit my ne|phew for him; and the colonel him&s;elf offered me to make me chaplain to his regiment, which I refu&s;ed in favour of Sir Oliver Hearty, who told us he would &s;acrifice every thing to his coun|try; and I believe he would, except his hunting, which he &s;tuck &s;o clo&s;e to, that in five years toge|ther, he went but twice up to parliament; and one of tho&s;e times, I have been told, never was within &s;ight of the hou&s;e. However, he was a worthy man, and the be&s;t friend I ever had: for by his intere&s;t with a bi&s;hop, he got me replaced into my curacy, and gave me eight pounds out of his own pocket to buy me a gown and ca&s;&s;ock, and furni&s;h my hou&s;e. He had our intere&s;t while he lived, which was not many years. On his death I had fre&s;h applications made to me; for all the world knew the intere&s;t I had with my good nephew, who now was a leading man in the corporation; and Sir Thomas Booby buying <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he e&s;tate which had been Sir Oliver's, propo&s;ed him&s;elf a candidate. He was then a young gen|tleman ju&s;t come from his travels; and it did me good to hear him di&s;cour&s;e on affairs, which, for my part, I knew nothing of. If I had been ma&s;|ter of a thou&s;and votes, he &s;hould have had them all. I engaged my nephew in his intere&s;t; and
<PB N="159" REF="023370_0158_0FBF37CBEC560190">
he was elected, and a very fine parliament-man he was. They tell me he made &s;peeches of an hour long; and I have been told very fine ones: but he could never per&s;uade the parliament to be of his opinion.&mdash;<HI>Non omnia po&s;&s;umus omnes.</HI> He promi&s;ed me a living, poor man; and I believe I &s;hould have had it, but an accident happened; which was, that my lady had promi&s;ed it before, unknown to him. This indeed I never heard till afterwards: for my nephew, who died about a month before the incumbent, always told me I might be a&s;&s;ured of it. Since that time, Sir Thomas, poor man, had always &s;o much bu&s;i|ne&s;s, that he never could find lei&s;ure to &s;ee me. I believe it was partly my lady's fault too; who did not think my dre&s;s good enough for the gen|try at her table. However, I mu&s;t do him the ju&s;tice to &s;ay, he never was ungrateful; and I have always found his kitchen, and his cellar too, open to me; many a time after &s;ervice on a Sun|day, for I preach at four churches, have I recruit|ed my &s;pirits with a gla&s;s of his ale. Since my nephew's death, the corporation is in other hands; and I am not a man of that con&s;equence I was formerly. I have now no longer any talents to lay out in the &s;ervice of my country; and to whom nothing is given, of him can nothing be required. However, on all proper &s;ea&s;ons, &s;uch as the ap|proach of an election, I throw a &s;uitable da&s;h or two into my &s;ermons; which I have the plea&s;ure to hear is not di&s;agreeable to Sir Thomas, and the other hone&s;t gentlemen my neighbours, who have all promi&s;ed me the&s;e five years, to procure an ordination for a &s;on of mine, who is now near thirty, hath an infinite &s;tock of learning, and is, I thank heaven, of an unexceptionable life; tho',

as he was never at an univer&s;ity, the bi&s;hop refu|&s;es to ordain him. Too much care cannot in|deed be taken in admitting any to the &s;acred of|fice; tho' I hope he will never act &s;o as to be a di&s;grace to any order: but will &s;erve his God and his country to the utmo&s;t of his power, as I have endeavoured to do before him; nay, will lay down his life whenever called to that purpo&s;e. I am &s;ure I have educated him in tho&s;e princi|ples; &s;o that I have acquitted my duty, and &s;hall have nothing to an&s;wer for on that account: but I do not di&s;tru&s;t him; for he is a good boy; and, if Providence &s;hould throw it in his way to be of as much con&s;equence in a public light, as his fa|ther once was; I can an&s;wer for him, he will u&s;e his talents as hone&s;tly as I have done.</Q></P>

<P>In which the gentleman de&s;cants on bravery and heroic virtue, till an unlucky accident puts an end to the di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE gentleman highly commended Mr. Adams for his good re&s;olutions, and told him, <Q>he hoped his &s;on would tread in his &s;teps;</Q> adding, <Q>that if he would not die for his country, he would not be worthy to live in it.

<P>'Sir,' &s;aid he, <Q>I have di&s;inherited a nephew who is in the army; becau&s;e he would not ex|change his commi&s;&s;ion, and go to the We&s;t-In|dies. I believe the ra&s;cal is a coward, though he pretends to be in love for&s;ooth. I would have all &s;uch fellows hanged, Sir; I would have them

hanged.</Q> Adams an&s;wered, <Q>that would be too &s;evere: that men did not make them&s;elves; and if fear had too much a&s;cendance in the mind, the man was rather to be pitied than abhorred: that rea&s;on and time might teach him to &s;ubdue it.</Q> He &s;aid, <Q>a man might be a coward at one time, and brave at another. Homer,</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>who &s;o well under&s;tood and copied nature, hath taught us this le&s;&s;on, for Paris fights, and Hector runs away: nay, we have a mighty in&s;tance of this in the hi&s;tory of later ages, no longer ago than the 705th year of Rome, when the great Pompey, who had won &s;o many battles, and been honoured with &s;o many triumphs, and of who&s;e valour &s;everal au|thors, e&s;pecially Cicero and Paterculus, have form|ed &s;uch elogiums; this very Pompey left the bat|tle of Phar&s;alia before he had lo&s;t it, and retreated to his tent, where he &s;at like the mo&s;t pu&s;illani|mous ra&s;cal in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">it of de&s;pair, and yielded a victo|ry, which was to determine the empire of the world, to Cae&s;ar.

The gen|tleman an&s;wered with great warmth, and talked much of courage and his country, till perceiving it grew late, he a&s;ked Adams, <Q>what place he intend|ed for that night?</Q> He told him, <Q>he waited there for the &s;tage-coach.</Q> 'The &s;tage-coach!

The gentleman told him, <Q>he would hardly be able to overtake them; and that if he did not know his way, he would be in danger of lo&s;ing him&s;elf on the downs; for it would be pre&s;ently dark; and he might ramble about all night, and perhaps, find him&s;elf farther from his journey's end in the mor|ning than he was now. He advi&s;ed him therefore to accompany him to his hou&s;e, which was very little out of his way, a&s;&s;uring him, that he would find &s;ome country fellow in his pari&s;h, who would conduct him for &s;ix pence to the city where he was going.</Q> Adams accepted this propo&s;al, and on they travelled, the gentleman renewing his di&s;|cour&s;e on courage, and the infamy of not being rea|dy at all times to &s;acrifice our lives to our country. Night overtook them much about the &s;ame time as they arrived near &s;ome bu&s;hes: whence, on a &s;ud|den, they heard the mo&s;t violent &s;hrieks imaginable in a female voice. Adams offered to &s;natch the gun out of his companion's hand. <Q>What are you do|ing?</Q> &s;aid he. 'Doing!' &s;ays Adams, <Q>I am ha&s;tening to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the poor creature whom &s;ome villains are murdering.</Q> <Q>You are not mad enough, I hope,</Q> &s;ays the gentleman trembling: <Q>Do you con&s;ider this gun is only charged with &s;hot, and that the robbers are mo&s;t probably furni&s;hed with pi&s;tols loaded with bul|lets? This is no bu&s;ine&s;s of ours; let us make as much ha&s;te as po&s;&s;ible out of the way, or we may fall into their hands our&s;elves.</Q> The &s;hrieks now increa&s;ing, Adams made no an&s;wer, but &s;napt his fingers, and brandi&s;hing his crab&s;tick, made direct|ly to the place whence the voice i&s;&s;ued; and the man of courage made as much expedition towards his own home, whither he e&s;caped in a very &s;hort time without once looking behind him: where we will
<PB N="163" REF="023370_0162_0FBF37D592AA7910">
leave him to contemplate his own bravery, and to cen&s;ure the want of it in others: and return to the good Adams, who on coming up to the place whence the noi&s;e proceeded, found a woman &s;trug|gling with a man, who had thrown her on the ground, and had almo&s;t overpowered her. The great abilities of Mr. Adams were not nece&s;&s;ary to have formed a right judgment of this affair on the fir&s;t &s;ight. He did not therefore want the entrea|ties of the poor wretch to a&s;&s;i&s;t her; but lifting up his crab&s;tick, he immediately levelled a blow at that part of the ravi&s;her's head, where, according to the opinion of the ancients, the brains of &s;ome per&s;ons are depo&s;ited, and which he had undoubtedly let forth, had not nature, (who, as wi&s;e men have ob|&s;erved, equips all creatures with what is mo&s;t expe|dient for them) taken a provident care, (as &s;he al|ways doth with tho&s;e &s;he intends for encounters) to make this part of the head three times as thick as tho&s;e of ordinary men, who are de&s;igned to exer|ci&s;e talents which are vulgarly called rational and for whom, as brains are nece&s;&s;ary, &s;he is obliged to leave &s;ome room for them in the cavity of the &s;kull: whereas, tho&s;e ingredients being entirely u&s;ele&s;s to per&s;ons of the heroic calling, &s;he hath an opportu|nity of thickening the bone, &s;o as to make it le&s;s &s;ubject to any impre&s;&s;ion, or liable to be cracked or broken; and indeed, in &s;ome who are prede&s;tined to the command of armies and empires, &s;he is &s;uppo&s;ed &s;ometimes to make that part perfectly &s;olid.</P>
<P>As a game-cock, when engaged in amorous toy|ing with a hen, if perchance he e&s;pies another cock at hand, immediately quits his female, and oppo&s;es him&s;elf to his rival: &s;o did the ravi&s;her, on the in|formation of the crab&s;tick, immediately leap from the woman, and ha&s;tened to a&s;&s;ail the man. He had
<PB N="164" REF="023370_0163_0FBF37D7D40FA2A8">
no weapons but what nature had furni&s;hed him with. However, he clenched his fi&s;t, and pre&s;ently darted it at that part of Adams's brea&s;t where the heart is lodged. Adams &s;taggered at the violence of the blow, when, throwing away his &s;taff, he like|wi&s;e clenched that fi&s;t which we have before com|memorated, and would have di&s;charged it full in the brea&s;t of his antagoni&s;t, had he not dexterou&s;ly caught it with his left hand, at the &s;ame time dart|ing his head, (which &s;ome modern heroes of the lower cla&s;s u&s;e, like the battering-ram of the anti|ents, for a weapon of offence; another rea&s;on to ad|mire the cunningne&s;s of nature, in compo&s;ing it of tho&s;e impenetrable materials) da&s;hing his head, I &s;ay into the &s;tomach of Adams, he tumbled him on his back, and not having any regard to the laws of heroi&s;m, which would have re&s;trained him from any farther attack on his enemy 'till he was again on his legs, he threw him&s;elf upon him, and laying hold on the ground with his left hand, he with his right belaboured the body of Adams 'till he was weary, and indeed, 'till he concluded (to u&s;e the language of fighting) 'that he had done his bu&s;ine&s;s;' or in the language of poetry, <Q>that he had &s;ent him to the &s;hades below; in plain Engli&s;h, 'that he was dead.</Q></P>
<P>But Adams, who was no chicken, and could bear a drubbing as well as any boxing champion in the univer&s;e, lay &s;till only to watch his opportunity; and now perceiving his antagoni&s;t to pant with his labours, he exerted his utmo&s;t force at once, and with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, that he overturned him, and be|came his &s;uperior; when fixing one of his knees in his brea&s;t, he cried out in an exulting voice, <Q>It is my turn now:</Q> and after a few minutes con|&s;tant application, he gave him &s;o dexterous a blow
<PB N="165" REF="023370_0164_0FBF37DA03E8E290">
ju&s;t under his chin, that the fellow no longer retain|ed any motion, and Adams began to fear he had &s;truck him once too often; for he often a&s;&s;erted, <Q>he &s;hould be concerned to have the blood of even the wicked upon him.</Q></P>
<P>Adams got up, and called aloud to the young woman&mdash;<Q>Be of good cheer, dam&s;el, &s;aid he, you are no longer in danger of your ravi&s;her, who, I am terribly afraid, lies dead at my feet; but God forgive me what I have done in defence of inno|cence.</Q> The poor wretch, who had been &s;ome time in recovering &s;trength enough to ri&s;e, and had afterwards, during the engagement, &s;tood trembling, being di&s;abled by fear, even from run|ning away, hearing her champion was victorious, came up to him, but not without apprehen&s;ion, even of her deliverer; which, however, &s;he was &s;oon relieved from, by his courteous behaviour and gentle words. They were both &s;tanding by the body, which lay motionle&s;s on the ground, and which Adams wi&s;hed to &s;ee &s;tir much more than the woman did, when he earne&s;tly begged her to tell him, <Q>by what misfortune &s;he came, at &s;uch a time of night, into &s;o lonely a place?</Q> She ac|quainted him, <Q>&s;he was travelling towards Lon|don, and had accidentally met with the per&s;on from whom he had delivered her, who told her he was likewi&s;e on his journey to the &s;ame place and would keep her company: an offer which, &s;u&s;pecting no harm, &s;he had accepted; that he told her, they were at a &s;mall di&s;tance from an inn where &s;he might take up her lodging that evening, and he would &s;hew her a nearer way to it than by following the road. That if &s;he had &s;u&s;pected him, (which &s;he did not, he &s;poke &s;o kindly to her,) being alone on the&s;e downs in
<PB N="166" REF="023370_0165_0FBF37DC96544348">
the dark, &s;he had no human means to avoid him; that therefore &s;he put her whole tru&s;t in Provi|dence, and walk'd on, expecting every moment to arrive at the inn; when, on a &s;udden, being come to tho&s;e bu&s;hes, he de&s;ired her to &s;top, and after &s;ome rude ki&s;&s;es, which &s;he re&s;i&s;ted, and &s;ome entreaties, which &s;he rejected, he laid vio|lent hands on her, and was attempting to execute his wicked will, when, &s;he thanked G&mdash;, he timely came up and prevented him.</Q> Adams encouraged her for &s;aying &s;he had put her whole tru&s;t in Providence, and told her, <Q>he doubted not but Providence had &s;ent him to her deliverance, as a reward for that tru&s;t. He wi&s;hed indeed, he had not deprived the wicked wretch of life, but G&mdash;'s will be done; he &s;aid, he hoped the goodne&s;s of his intention would excu&s;e him in the next world, and he tru&s;ted in her evidence to acquit him in this.</Q> He was then &s;ilent, and began to con&s;ider with him&s;elf, whether it would be properer to make his e&s;cape or to deliver him|&s;elf into the hands of ju&s;tice; which meditation ended, as the reader will &s;ee in the next chapter.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE &s;ilence of Adams, added to the darkne&s;s of the night and loneline&s;s of the place, &s;truck dreadful apprehen&s;ions into the poor wo|man's mind: She began to fear as great an enemy
<PB N="167" REF="023370_0166_0FBF37E085189890">
in her deliverer, as he had delivered her from; and as &s;he had not light enough to di&s;cover the age of Adams, and the benevolence vi&s;ible in his counte|nance, &s;he &s;u&s;pected he had u&s;ed her as &s;ome very hone&s;t men have u&s;ed their country; and had re|&s;cued her out of the hands of one ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">er, in order to rifle her him&s;elf. Such were the &s;u&s;picions &s;he drew from his &s;ilence: but indeed, they were ill|grounded. He &s;tood over his vanqui&s;hed enemy, wi&s;ely weighing in his mind the objections which might be made to either of the two methods of proceeding mentioned in the la&s;t chapter, his judg|ment &s;ometimes inclining to the one, and &s;ometimes to the other; for both &s;eemed to him &s;o equally advi&s;eable, and &s;o equally dangerous, that probably he would have ended his days, at lea&s;t two or three of them, on that very &s;pot, before he had taken any re&s;olution: At length he lifted up his eyes, and &s;pi|ed a light at a di&s;tance, to which he in&s;tantly ad|dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf with <HI>Heus tu, Traveller, hues tu!</HI> He pre&s;ently heard &s;everal voices, and perceived the light approaching toward him. The per&s;ons who attended the light began &s;ome to laugh, others to &s;ing, and others to halloo, at which the woman te&s;tified &s;ome fear, (for &s;he had concealed her &s;u&s;|picions of the par&s;on him&s;elf,) but Adams &s;aid, <Q>Be of good cheer, dam&s;el, and repo&s;e thy tru&s;t in the &s;ame Providence which hath hitherto pro|tected thee, and never will for&s;ake the innocent.</Q> The&s;e people who now approached were no other, reader, than a &s;et of young fellows, who came to the&s;e bu&s;hes in pur&s;uit of a diver&s;ion which they call Bird-batting. This, if thou art ignorant of it (as perhaps if thou ha&s;t never travelled beyond Ken|&s;ington, I&s;lington, Hackney, or the Borough, thou may'&s;t be) I will inform thee, is performed by

holding a large clap-net before a lanthorn, and at the &s;ame time beating the bu&s;hes; for the birds, when they are di&s;turbed from their places of re&s;t, or roo&s;t, immediately make to the light, and &s;o are in|ticed within the net. Adams immediately told them what happened, and de&s;ired them <Q>to hold the lanthorn to the face of the man on the ground, for he feared he had &s;mote him fatally.</Q> But, in|deed his fears were frivolous; for the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">llow, tho' he had been &s;tunned by the la&s;t blow he received, had long &s;ince recovered his &s;en&s;es, and finding him|&s;elf quit of Adams, had li&s;tened attentively to the di&s;cour&s;e between him and the young woman; for who&s;e departure he had patiently waited, that he might likewi&s;e withdraw him&s;elf, having no longer hopes of &s;ucceeding in his de&s;ires, which were moreover almo&s;t as well cooled by Mr. Adams, as they could have been by the young woman her&s;elf, had he obtained his utmo&s;t wi&s;h.</P>
<P>This fellow, who had a readine&s;s at improving any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, thought he might now play a better part than that of a dead man; and accordingly the moment the candle was held to his face, he leapt up, and laying hold on Adams, cried out, <Q>No, vil|lain, I am not dead, though you and your wicked whore might well think me &s;o, after the barbarous cruelties you have exerci&s;ed on me.</Q> Gentlemen, &s;aid he, <Q>you are luckily come to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a poor traveller, who would otherwi&s;e have been robbed and murdered by this vile man and woman, who led me hither out of my way from the high|road, and both falling on me have u&s;ed me as you &s;ee.</Q> Adams was going to an&s;wer, when one of the young fellows cry'd, <Q>d&mdash;n them, let's carry them both before the ju&s;tice.</Q> The poor woman began to tremble, and Adams lifted up his voice,
<PB N="169" REF="023370_0168_0FBF37E3EA502F10">
but in vain. Three or four of them laid hands on him, and one holding the lanthorn to his face, they all agreed, <Q>he had the mo&s;t villainous countenance they ever beheld;</Q> and an attorney's clerk who was one of the company declared, <Q>he was &s;ure he had remembered him at the bar.</Q> As to the wo|man, her hair was di&s;hevelled in the &s;truggle: and her no&s;e had bled, &s;o that they could not perceive whether &s;he was hand&s;ome or ugly, but they &s;aid her fright plainly di&s;covered her guilt. And &s;earch|ing her pockets, as they did tho&s;e of Adams, for mo|ney, which the fellow &s;aid he had lo&s;t, they found in her pocket a pur&s;e with &s;ome gold in it, which abundantly convinced them, e&s;pecially as the fellow offered to &s;wear to it. Mr. Adams was found to have no more than one halfpenny about him. This the clerk &s;aid, 'was a great piece of pre&s;umption that he was an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ld offender, by cunningly giving all the booty to the woman.' To which all the re&s;t readily a&s;&s;ented.</P>
<P>This accident promi&s;ing them better &s;port than what they had propo&s;ed, they quitted their intention of catching birds, and unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved to pro|ceed to the ju&s;tice with the offenders. Being in|formed what a de&s;perate fellow Adams was, they tied his hands behind him; and having hid their nets among the bu&s;hes, and the lanthorn being car|ried before them, they placed the two pri&s;oners in their front, and then began their march: Adams not only &s;ubmitting patiently to his own fate, but comforting and encouraging his companion under her &s;ufferings.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t they were on their way, the clerk in|formed the re&s;t, that this adventure would prove, a very beneficial one: for that they would be all en|titled to their proportions of 801. for apprehending
<PB N="170" REF="023370_0169_0FBF37E70E03EFB8">
the robbers. This occa&s;ioned a contention con|cerning the parts which they had &s;everally borne in taking them; one in&s;i&s;ting, he ought to have the greate&s;t &s;hare; for he had fir&s;t laid his hands on Adams; another claiming a &s;uperior part, for hav|ing fir&s;t held the lanthorn to the man's face on the ground, by which, he &s;aid, <Q>the whole was di&s;co|ver'd.</Q> The clerk claimed four fifths of the re|ward, for having propo&s;ed to &s;earch the pri&s;oners; and likewi&s;e the carrying them before the ju&s;tice&punc; he &s;aid indeed, <Q>in &s;trict ju&s;tice, he ought to have the whole.</Q> The&s;e claims, however, they at la&s;t con&s;ented to refer to a future deci&s;ion, but &s;eem'd all to agree that the clerk was entitled to a moiety. They then debated what money &s;hould be allotted to the young fellow, who had been employed only in holding the nets. He very mode&s;tly &s;aid. <Q>That he did not apprehend any large proportion would fall to his charge; but hoped they would allow him &s;omething: he de&s;ired them to con&s;i|der, that they had a&s;&s;igned their nets to his care, which prevented him from being as forward as any in laying hold of the robbers, (for &s;o the&s;e in|nocent people were called;) that if he had not occupied the nets, &s;ome other mu&s;t: concluding however, that he &s;hould be contented with the &s;malle&s;t &s;hare imaginable, and &s;hould think that rather their bounty than his merit.</Q> But they were all unanimous in excluding him from any part whatever, the clerk particularly &s;wearing, <Q>if they gave him a &s;hilling, they might do what they plea&s;ed with the re&s;t; for he would not con|cern him&s;elf with the affair.</Q> This contention was &s;o hot, and &s;o totally engaged the attention of all the parties, that a dextrous nimble thief, had he been in Mr. Adams's &s;ituation, would have ta|ken
<PB N="171" REF="023370_0170_0FBF37E84B2443B0">
care to have given the ju&s;tice no trouble that evening. Indeed, it required not the art of a Shep|herd to e&s;cape, e&s;pecially as the darkne&s;s of the night would have &s;o much befriended him: but Adams tru&s;ted rather to his innocence than his heels, and without thinking of flight, which was ea&s;y, or re&s;i&s;tance (which was impo&s;&s;ible, as there were &s;ix lu&s;ty young fellows, be&s;ides the villain him&s;elf, pre&s;ent) he walked with perfect re&s;ignati|on the way they thought proper to conduct him.</P>
<P>Adams frequently vented him&s;elf in ejaculations during their journey; at la&s;t poor Jo&s;eph Andrews occurring to his mind, he could not refrain &s;ighing forth his name, which being heard by his compa|nion in affliction, &s;he cried, with &s;ome vehemence, <Q>Sure I &s;hould know that voice; you cannot cer|tainly, Sir, be Abraham Adams?</Q> <Q>Indeed, dam|&s;el,</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>that is my name; there is &s;ome|thing al&s;o in your voice, which per&s;uades me I have heard it before.</Q> <Q>La, Sir, &s;ays &s;he, don't you remember poor Fanny?</Q> 'How, Fanny!' an&s;wered Adams, <Q>indeed I very well remember you; what can have brought you hither?</Q> <Q>I have told you, Sir,</Q> replied &s;he, <Q>I was travelling towards London; but I thought you mentioned Jo&s;eph Andrews, pray what is become of him?</Q> 'I left him, Child, this afternoon,' &s;aid Adams, <Q>in the &s;tage-coach, in his way towards our pa|ri&s;h, whither he is going to &s;ee you.</Q> <Q>To &s;ee me! La, Sir,</Q> an&s;wered Fanny, <Q>&s;ure you jeer me; what &s;hould he be going to &s;ee me for?</Q> 'Can you a&s;k that?' replied Adams. <Q>I hope Fanny you are not incon&s;tant; I a&s;&s;ure you he de&s;erves much better of you.</Q> La! 'Mr. A|dams,' &s;aid &s;he, <Q>what is Mr. Jo&s;eph to me? I am &s;ure I never had any thing to &s;ay to him, but

as one fellow-&s;ervant might to another.</Q> <Q>I am &s;orry to hear this,</Q> &s;aid Adams; <Q>a virtuous pa&s;|&s;ion for a young man, is what no woman need be a&s;hamed of. You either do not tell me truth, or you are fal&s;e to a very worthy man.</Q> Adams then told her what had happened at the inn, to which &s;he li&s;tened very attentively; and a &s;igh often e&s;cap|ed from her, notwith&s;tanding her utmo&s;t endea|vours to the contrary, nor could &s;he prevent her|&s;elf from a&s;king a thou&s;and que&s;tions, which would have a&s;&s;ured any one but Adams, who never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aw farther into people than they de&s;ired to let him, of the truth of pa&s;&s;ion &s;he endeavoured to con|ceal. Indeed, the fact was, that this poor girl hav|ing heard of Jo&s;eph's misfortune by &s;ome of the &s;ervants belonging to the coach, which we have formerly mentioned to have &s;topt at the inn while the poor youth was confined to his bed, that in&s;tant abandoned the cow &s;he was milking, and taking with her a little bundle of clothes under her arm, and all the money &s;he was worth in her own pur&s;e, without con&s;ulting any one, immediately &s;et for|ward, in pur&s;uit of one, whom, notwith&s;tanding her &s;hyne&s;s to the par&s;on, &s;he loved with inexpre&s;|&s;ible violence, though with the pure&s;t and mo&s;t de|licate pa&s;&s;ion.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>What happened to them while before the ju&s;tice. A chapter very full of learning.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THEIR fellow-travellers were &s;o engaged in the hot di&s;pute concerning the divi&s;ion of the re|ward for apprehending the&s;e innocent people, that they attended very little to their di&s;cour&s;e. They were now arrived at the ju&s;tice's hou&s;e, and had &s;ent one of his &s;ervants in to acquaint his wor&s;hip, that they had taken two robbers, and brought them before him. The ju&s;tice, who was ju&s;t returned from a fox-cha&s;e, and had not yet fini&s;hed his din|ner, ordered them to carry the pri&s;oners into the &s;ta|ble, whither they were attended by all the &s;ervants in the hou&s;e, and all the people in the neighbour|hood, who flocked together to &s;ee them with as much curio&s;ity as if there was &s;omething uncom|mon to be &s;een, or that a rogue did not look like other people.</P>
<P>The ju&s;tice now being in the height of his mirth and his cups, bethought him&s;elf of the pri&s;oners; and telling his company he believed they &s;hould have good &s;port in their examination, he ordered them into his pre&s;ence. They had no &s;ooner en|tered the room, than he began to revile them, &s;aying, <Q>that robberies on the highway were now grown &s;o frequent, that people could not &s;leep &s;afely in their beds, and a&s;&s;ured them they both &s;hould be made examples of at the en&s;uing a&s;&s;izes.</Q> After he had gone on &s;ome time in this manner, he was reminded by his clerk, <Q>that it would be proper to take the depo&s;ition of the witne&s;&s;es again&s;t them:</Q> which he bid him do, <Q>and he would light his pipe
<PB N="174" REF="023370_0173_0FBF37F09C4E0860">
in the mean time.</Q> Whil&s;t the clerk was employ|ed in writing down the depo&s;ition of the fellow who had pretended to be robbed, the ju&s;tice employed him&s;elf in cracking je&s;ts on poor Fanny, in which he was &s;econded by all the company at table. One a&s;ked, <Q>whether &s;he was to be indicted for a high|wayman?</Q> Another whi&s;pered in her ear, <Q>if &s;he had not provided her&s;elf a great belly, he was at her &s;ervice.</Q> A third &s;aid, <Q>he warranted &s;he was a relation of Turpin.</Q> To which one of the company, a great wit, &s;haking his head, and then his &s;ides, an&s;wered, <Q>he believed &s;he was nearer re|lated to Turpis;</Q> at which there was an univer|&s;al laugh. They were proceeding thus with this poor girl, when &s;omebody &s;moaking the ca&s;&s;ock peeping from under the coat of Adams, cried out, 'What have we here, a par&s;on?'

place of the clerk, which I di&s;po&s;ed of to the be&s;t of my abilities, according to merit: that is, I gave it to him who had the happie&s;t knack at &s;etting a p&s;alm. The clerk was no &s;ooner e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in his place than a contention began be|tween the two di&s;appointed candidates concern|ing their excellence, each contending, on whom, had they two been the only competitors, my elec|tion would have fallen. This di&s;pute frequent|ly di&s;turbed the congregation, and introduced a di&s;cord into the p&s;almody, till I was forced to &s;i|lence them both. But alas, the litigious &s;pirit could not be &s;tifled; and being no longer able to vent it&s;elf in &s;inging, it now broke forth in fight|ing. It produced many battles, (for they were very near a match;) and, I believe, would have ended fatally, had not the death of the clerk given me an opportunity to promote one of them to the place; which pre&s;ently put an end to the di&s;pute, and entirely reconciled the contending parties.</Q> Adams then proceeded to make &s;ome philo&s;ophi|cal ob&s;ervations on the folly of growing warm in di&s;putes, in which neither party is intere&s;ted. He then applied him&s;elf vigorou&s;ly to &s;moaking; and a long &s;ilence en&s;ued, which was at length broke by the ju&s;tice; who began to &s;ing forth his own prai&s;es, and to value him&s;elf exceedingly on his nice di&s;cernment in the cau&s;e which had late|ly been before him. He was quickly interrupted by Mr. Adams, between whom and his wor&s;hip a di&s;pute now aro&s;e, whether he ought not, in &s;trictne&s;s of law, to have committed him, the &s;aid Adams; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> which the latter maintained he ought to have been committed, and the ju&s;tice as vehemently held be ought not.

<P>ADAMS, Fanny, and the guide, &s;et out toge|ther, about one in the morning, the moon being ju&s;t ri&s;en. They had not gone above a mile before a mo&s;t violent &s;torm of rain obliged them to take &s;helter in an inn, or rather ale-hou&s;e; where Adams immediately procured him&s;elf a good fire, a toa&s;t and ale, and a pipe, and began to &s;moke with great content, utterly forgetting every thing that had happened.</P>
<P>Fanny &s;at likewi&s;e down by the fire; but was much more impatient at the &s;torm. She pre&s;ently engaged the eyes of the ho&s;t, his wife, the maid of the hou&s;e, and the young fellow who was their guide; they all conceived they had never &s;een any thing half &s;o hand&s;ome: and indeed, reader, if thou art of an amorous hue, I advi&s;e you to &s;kip over

<P>Fanny was now in the nineteenth year of her age: &s;he was tall and delicately &s;haped; but not one of tho&s;e &s;lender young women, who &s;eem rather in|tended to hang up in the hall of an anatomi&s;t, than for any other purpo&s;e. On the contrary, &s;he was &s;o plump, that &s;he &s;eemed bur&s;ting through her tight &s;tays, e&s;pecially in the part which confined her &s;wel|ling brea&s;ts. Nor did her hips want the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a hoop to extend them. The exact &s;hape of her arms denoted the form of tho&s;e limbs which &s;he concealed; and though they were a little reddened by her labour; yet, if her &s;leeve &s;lipt above her el|bow, or her handkerchief di&s;covered any part of her neck, a whitene&s;s appeared which the fine&s;t Italian paint would be unable to reach. Her hair was of a che&s;nut brown, and nature had been extremely lavi&s;h to her of it, which &s;he had cut, and on Sun|days u&s;ed to curl down her neck in the modern fa|&s;hion. Her forehead was high, her eye-brows arched, and rather full than otherwi&s;e. Her eyes black and &s;parkling; her no&s;e ju&s;t inclining to the Roman; her lips red and moi&s;t, and her under lip, according to the opinion of the ladies, too pouting. Her teeth were white, but not exactly even. The &s;mall-pox had left one only mark on her chin, which

Her complexion was fair, a lit|tle injured by the &s;un, but over&s;pread with &s;uch a bloom, that the fine&s;t ladies would have exchanged all their white for it: add to the&s;e a countenance, in which, though &s;he was extremely ba&s;hful, a &s;en&s;ibi|lity appeared almo&s;t incredible; and a &s;weetne&s;s whenever &s;he &s;miled, beyond either imitation or de|&s;cription.

but of longer duration: for as &s;oon as the fir&s;t tumults of Adams's rapture were over, he ca&s;t his eyes towards the fire, where AE&s;chylus lay expir|ing; and immediately re&s;cued the poor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">emains, to wit, the &s;heep-&s;kin covering of his dear friend, which was the work of his own hands, and had been his in&s;eparable companion for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">wards of thirty years.</P>
<P>Fanny had no &s;ooner perfectly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">ered her&s;elf, than &s;he began to re&s;train the impetuo&s;ity of her tran&s;port; and reflecting on what &s;he had done and &s;uffered in the pre&s;ence of &s;o many, &s;he was imme|diately covered with confu&s;ion, and pu&s;hing Jo|&s;eph gently from her, &s;he begged him to be quiet: nor would admit of either ki&s;s or embrace, any longer. Then &s;eeing Mrs. Slip&s;lop, &s;he curt'&s;ied, and offered to advance to her; but that high woman would not return one of her curt'&s;ies; but ca&s;ting her eyes another way, immediately withdrew into another room, muttering as &s;he went, &s;he wondered who the creature was.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>A di&s;&s;ertation concerning high people and low people, with Mrs. Slip&s;lop's departure in no very good tem|per of mind, and the evil plight in which &s;he left A|dams and his company.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT will doubtle&s;s &s;eem extremely odd to many readers, that Mrs. Slip&s;lop, who had lived &s;eve|ral years in the &s;ame hou&s;e with Fanny, &s;hould in a &s;hort &s;eparation utterly forget her. And indeed the truth is, that &s;he remembered her very well. As we would not willingly therefore, that any thing &s;hould appear unnatural in this our hi&s;tory, we will en|deavour
<PB N="187" REF="023370_0186_0FBF3822EF0C99F8">
to explain the rea&s;ons of her conduct; nor do we doubt being able to &s;atisfy the mo&s;t curious reader, that Mrs. Slip&s;lop did not in the lea&s;t devi|ate from the common road in this behaviour; and indeed, had &s;he done otherwi&s;e, &s;he mu&s;t have de|&s;cended below her&s;elf, and would have very ju&s;tly been liable to cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>Be it known then, that the human &s;pecies are divided into two &s;orts of people, to wit, High people and Low people. As by high people I would not be under&s;tood to mean per&s;ons literal|ly born higher in their dimen&s;ions than the re&s;t of the &s;pecies, nor metaphorically tho&s;e of exalted characters or abilities; &s;o by low people I cannot be con&s;trued to intend the rever&s;e. High people &s;ignify no other than people of fa&s;hion, and low people tho&s;e of no fa&s;hion. Now this word Fa|&s;hion hath by long u&s;e lo&s;t its original meaning, from which at pre&s;ent it gives us a very different idea; for I am deceived, if by per&s;ons of fa&s;hion, we do not generally include a conception of birth and accompli&s;hments &s;uperior to the herd of man|kind; whereas in reality, nothing more was ori|ginally meant by a per&s;on of fa&s;hion, than a per&s;on who dre&s;t him&s;elf in the fa&s;hion of the times; and the word really and truly &s;ignifies no more at this day. Now the world being thus divided into peo|ple of fa&s;hion, and people of no fa&s;hion, a fierce con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ention aro&s;e between them; nor would tho&s;e of one party, to avoid &s;u&s;picion, be &s;een publick|ly to &s;peak to tho&s;e of the other, though they often held a very good corre&s;pondence in private. In this contention, it is difficult to &s;ay which party &s;ucceeded: for whil&s;t the people of fa&s;hion &s;eized &s;everal places to their own u&s;e, &s;uch as courts, a&s;|&s;emblies, operas, balls, &amp;c. the people of no fa&s;hi|on,
<PB N="188" REF="023370_0187_0FBF3826E5DCD348">
be&s;ides one royal place, called his maje&s;ty's bear-garden, have been in con&s;tant po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all hops, fairs, revels, &amp;c. Two places have been agreed to be divided between them, namely the church and the playhou&s;e; where they &s;egregate them&s;elves from each other in a remarkable man|ner: for as the people of fa&s;hion exalt them&s;elves at church over the heads of the people of no fa&s;hi|on: &s;o in the playhou&s;e they aba&s;e them&s;elves in the &s;ame degree under their feet. This di&s;tincti|on I have never met with any one able to account for: it is &s;ufficient, that &s;o far from looking on each other as brethren in the Chri&s;tian language&punc; they &s;eem &s;carce to regard each other as of the &s;ame &s;pecies. This the terms, <Q>&s;trange per&s;ons, people one does not know, the creature, wretches, bea&s;ts, brutes,</Q> and many other appellations evidently demon&s;trate; which Mrs. Slip&s;lop hav|ing often heard her mi&s;tre&s;s u&s;e, thought &s;he had al&s;o a right to u&s;e in her turn: and, perhaps, &s;he was not mi&s;taken; for the&s;e two parties e&s;pecially tho&s;e bordering nearly on each other, to wit, the lowe&s;t of the high, and the highe&s;t of the low, of|ten change their parties according to place and time; for tho&s;e who are people of fa&s;hion in one place, are often people of no fa&s;hion in another. And with regard to time, it may not be unplea&s;ant to &s;urvey the picture of dependance like a kind of ladder: as for in&s;tance; early in the morning ari|&s;es the po&s;tilion, or &s;ome other boy which great families, no more than great &s;hips, are without, and falls to bru&s;hing the cloaths, and cleaning the &s;hoes of John the footman, who being dre&s;t him|&s;elf, applies his hand to the &s;ame labours for Mr. Second-hand the &s;quire's gentleman; the gentle|man in the like manner, a little later in the day,

Nor is there, perhaps, in this whole ladder of dependance, any one &s;tep at a greater di&s;tance from the other, than the fir&s;t from the &s;econd: &s;o that to a philo&s;opher the que&s;tion might only &s;eem, whether you would chu&s;e to be a great man at &s;ix in the morning, or at two in the afternoon. And yet there are &s;carce two of the&s;e, who do not think the lea&s;t familia|rity with the per&s;ons below them a conde&s;cen&s;ion, and, if they were to go one &s;tep farther, a degra|dation.</P>
<P>And now, reader, I hope thou wilt pardon this long digre&s;&s;ion, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eemed to me nece&s;&s;ary to vindicate the character of Mrs. Slip&s;lop, from what low people who have never &s;een high people, might think an ab&s;urdity: but we who know them, mu&s;t have daily found very high per&s;ons know us in one place and not in another, to-day, and not to|morrow; all which it is difficult to account for, otherwi&s;e than I have here endeavoured: and per|haps, if the gods, according to the opinion of &s;ome, made men only to laugh at them; there is no part of our behaviour which an&s;wers the end of our creation better than this.</P>
<P>But to return to our hi&s;tory: Adams who knew no more of this than the cat which &s;at on the ta|ble, imagining Mrs. Slip&s;lop's memory had been much wor&s;e than it really was, followed her into the next room, crying out, <Q>Madam Slip&s;lop, here is one of your old acquaintance: do but &s;ee what a fine woman &s;he is grown &s;ince &s;he left lady

Booby's &s;ervice.</Q> <Q>I think I reflect &s;omething of her,</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, with great dignity, <Q>but I can't remember all the inferior &s;ervants in our fa|mily.</Q> She then proceeded to &s;atisfy Adams's cu|rio&s;ity, by telling him, <Q>when &s;he arrived at the inn, &s;he found a chai&s;e ready for her; that her lady being expected very &s;hortly in the country, &s;he was obliged to make the utmo&s;t ha&s;te, and in commen&s;uration, of Jo&s;eph's lamene&s;s, &s;he had taken him with her;</Q> and la&s;tly, <Q>that the exce&s;|&s;ive virulence of the &s;torm had driven them into the hou&s;e where he found them.</Q> After which, &s;he acquainted Adams with his having left his hor&s;e, and expre&s;t &s;ome wonder at his having &s;trayed &s;o far out of his way, and at meeting him, as &s;he &s;aid, <Q>in the company of that wench, who &s;he feared was no better than &s;he &s;hould be.</Q></P>
<P>The hor&s;e was no &s;ooner put into Adams's head, but he was immediately driven out by this reflec|tion on the character of Fanny.

He then proceeded to inform her of the accident of their meeting; but when he came to mention the circum&s;tance of delivering her from the rape, &s;he &s;aid, <Q>&s;he thought him properer for the army than the clergy: that it did not become a clergyman to lay violent hands on any one; that he &s;hould have rather prayed that &s;he might be &s;trengthened.</Q> Adams &s;aid, <Q>he was very far from being a&s;hamed of what he had done;</Q> &s;he replied, <Q>want of &s;hame was not the currycuri&s;tic of a clergyman.</Q> This dialogue might have pro|bably grown warmer, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ad not Jo&s;eph opportunely entered the room, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> leave of Madam Slip|&s;lop

to introduce Fanny: but &s;he po&s;itively refu&s;ed to admit any &s;uch trollops; and told him, <Q>&s;he would have been burnt, before &s;he would have &s;uffered him to get into a chai&s;e with her, if &s;he had once re&s;pected him of having his &s;luts way|laid on the road for him;</Q> adding, <Q>that Mr. Adams acted a very pretty part, and &s;he did not doubt but to &s;ee him a bi&s;hop.</Q> He made the be&s;t bow he could, and cried out, <Q>I thank you, madam, for that right reverend appellation, which I &s;hall take all hone&s;t means to de&s;erve.</Q> <Q>Very hone&s;t means,</Q> returned &s;he with a &s;neer, <Q>to bring good people together.</Q> At which words Adams took two or three &s;trides acro&s;s the room, when the coachman came to inform Mrs. Slip&s;lop, <Q>that the &s;torm was over, and the moon &s;hone ve|ry bright.</Q> She then &s;ent for Jo&s;eph, who was &s;itting without with his Fanny, and would have had him gone with her: but he peremptorily refu|&s;ed to leave Fanny behind; which threw the good woman into a violent rage. She &s;aid, <Q>&s;he would inform her lady what doings were carrying on, and did not doubt but &s;he would rid the pari&s;h of all &s;uch people;</Q> and concluded a long &s;peech full of bitterne&s;s and very hard words, with &s;ome re|flections on the clergy, not decent to repeat: at la&s;t, finding Jo&s;eph unmoveable, &s;he flung her&s;elf into the chai&s;e, ca&s;ting a look at Fanny as &s;he went, not unlike that which Cleopatra gives Octavia in the play. To &s;ay the truth, &s;he was mo&s;t di&s;|agreeably di&s;appointed by the pre&s;ence of Fanny; &s;he had, from her fir&s;t &s;eeing Jo&s;eph at the inn, conceived hopes of &s;omething which might have been accompli&s;hed at an ale-hou&s;e as well as a palace. Indeed, it is probable Mr. Adams had
<PB N="192" REF="023370_0191_0FBF383AFB446CA0">
re&s;cued more than Fanny from the danger of a rape that evening.</P>
<P>When the chai&s;e had carried off the enraged Slip|&s;lop; Adams, Jo&s;eph, and Fanny a&s;&s;embled over the fire; where they had a great deal of innocent chat, pretty enough; but as po&s;&s;ibly it would not be very entertaining to the reader, we &s;hall ha&s;ten to the morning; only ob&s;erving that none of them went to bed that night. Adams when he had &s;moaked three pipes, took a comfortable nap in a great chair, and left the lovers, who&s;e eyes were too well employed to permit any de&s;ire of &s;hutting them, to enjoy by them&s;elves, during &s;ome hours, an happi|ne&s;s which none of my readers who have never been in love, are capable of the lea&s;t conception of, tho' we had as many tongues as Homer de&s;ired to de|&s;cribe it with, and which all true lovers will repre|&s;ent to their own minds without the lea&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance from us.</P>
<P>Let it &s;uffice then to &s;ay, that Fanny, after a thou&s;and entreaties, at la&s;t gave up her whole &s;oul to Jo&s;eph, and almo&s;t fainting in his arms, with a &s;igh infinitely &s;ofter and &s;weeter too, than any Ara|bian breeze, &s;he whi&s;pered to his lips, which were then clo&s;e to hers, <Q>O Jo&s;eph, you have won me; I will be yours for ever.</Q> Jo&s;eph having thanked her on his knees, and embraced her with eagerne&s;s, which &s;he now almo&s;t returned, leapt up in a rap|ture, and awakened the par&s;on, earne&s;tly begging him, <Q>that he would that in&s;tant join their hands to|gether.</Q> Adams rebuked him for his reque&s;t, and told him, <Q>he would by no means con&s;ent to any thing contrary to the forms of the church: that he had no licence, nor indeed would he advi&s;e him to obtain one. That the church had pre&s;cribed a form, namely the publication of banns, with
<PB N="193" REF="023370_0192_0FBF383E4099A7F0">
which all good chri&s;tians ought to comply, and to the omi&s;&s;ion of which he attributed the many mi|&s;eries which befel great folks in marriage:</Q> con|cluding, <Q>As many as are joined together other|wi&s;e than G&mdash;'s word doth allow, are not joined together by G&mdash;, neither is their matrimony lawful.</Q> Fanny agreed with the par&s;on, &s;aying to Jo&s;eph with a blu&s;h, <Q>&s;he a&s;&s;ured him &s;he would not con&s;ent to any &s;uch thing, and that &s;he won|dered at his offering it.</Q> In which re&s;olution &s;he was comforted, and commended by Adams; and Jo&s;eph was obliged to wait patiently till after the third publication of the banns, which however he obtained the con&s;ent of Fanny, in the pre&s;ence of Adams, to put in at their arrival.</P>
<P>The &s;un had been now ri&s;en &s;ome hours, when Jo&s;eph finding his leg &s;urprizingly recovered, pro|po&s;ed to walk forward; but when they were all rea|dy to &s;et out, an accident a little retarded them. This was no other than the reckoning, which a|mounted to &s;even &s;hillings; no great &s;um, if we con&s;ider the immen&s;e quantity of ale which Mr. A|dams poured in. Indeed they had no objection to the rea&s;onablene&s;s of the bill, but many to the pro|bability of paying it; for the fellow who had taken poor Fanny's pur&s;e, had unluckily forgot to return it. So that the account &s;tood thus:

<ARGUMENT>
<P>An interview between par&s;on Adams and par&s;on Trulliber.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>PARSON Adams came to the hou&s;e of Par&s;on Trulliber, whom he found &s;tript into his wai&s;t|coat, with an apron on, and a pale in his hand, ju&s;t come from &s;erving his hogs; for Mr. Trulliber was a par&s;on on Sundays, but all the other &s;ix might more properly be called a farmer. He oc|cupied a &s;mall piece of land of his own, be&s;ides which he rented a con&s;iderable deal more. His wife milked his cows, managed his dairy, and fol|lowed the markets with butter and eggs. The hogs <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ell chiefly to his care, which he carefully waited on at home, and attended to fairs; on which occa&s;ion he was liable to many jokes, his own &s;ize being with much ale rendered little infe|rior to that of the bea&s;ts he &s;old. He was indeed one of the large&s;t men you &s;hould &s;ee, and could have acted the part of Sir John Fal&s;taff without
<PB N="195" REF="023370_0194_0FBF3841922975B8">
&s;tuffing. Add to this, that the rotundity of his belly was con&s;iderably increa&s;ed by the &s;hortne&s;s of his &s;tature, his &s;hadow a&s;cending very near as far in height when he lay on his back, as when he &s;tood on his legs. His voice was loud and hoar&s;e, and his accent extremely broad; to complete the whole, he had a &s;tateline&s;s in his gait, when he walked, not unlike that of a goo&s;e, only he &s;talked &s;lower.</P>
<P>Mr. Trulliber being informed that &s;omebody wanted to &s;peak with him, immediately &s;lipt off his apron, and cloathed him&s;elf in an old night|gown, being the dre&s;s in which he always &s;aw his company at home. His wife, who informed of Mr. Adams's arrival, had made a &s;mall mi&s;take; for &s;he had told her hu&s;band, <Q>&s;he believed here was a man come for &s;ome of his hogs.</Q> This &s;uppo&s;ition made Mr. Trulliber ha&s;ten with the utmo&s;t expedition to attend his gue&s;t. He no &s;ooner &s;aw Adams, than not in the lea&s;t doubting the cau&s;e of his errand to be what his wife had imagined, he told him, <Q>he was come in very good time; that he expected a dealer that very after|noon;</Q> and added, <Q>they were all pure and fat, and upwards of 20 &s;core a piece.</Q> Adams an|&s;wered, 'he believed he did not know him.' Yes, yes,' cried Trulliber, I have &s;een you often at fair; <Q>why, we have dealt before now, mun, I warrant you; yes, yes, cries he, I remember thy face very well, but won't mention a word more till you have &s;een them, tho' I have never &s;old thee a flitch of &s;uch bacon as is now in the &s;tye.</Q> Upon which he laid violent hands on Adams, and dragged him into the hogs-&s;tye, which was indeed but two &s;teps from his parlour-window. They were no &s;ooner arrived there than he cry'd out,
<PB N="196" REF="023370_0195_0FBF38458615D0C8">
<Q>Do but handle them; &s;tep in, friend, art welcome to handle them, whether do&s;t buy or no.</Q> A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> which words opening the gate, he pu&s;hed Adams into the pig-&s;tye, in&s;i&s;ting on it, that he &s;hould handle them before he would talk one word with him. Adams, who&s;e natural complai&s;ance was beyond any artificial, was obliged to comply before he was &s;uffered to explain him&s;elf; and laying hold on one of their tails, the unruly bea&s;t gave &s;uch a &s;udden &s;pring, that he threw poor Adams all along in the mire. Trulliber, in&s;tead of a&s;&s;i&s;ting him to get up, bur&s;t into a laughter, and entering the &s;tye, &s;aid to Adams, with &s;ome contempt&punc; Why, do&s;t not know how to handle a hog? and was going to lay hold of one him&s;elf; but Adams, who thought he had carried his complai&s;ance far enough, was no &s;ooner on his legs, than he e&s;caped out of the reach of the animals, and cried out, <HI>Nihil habeo cum porcis:</HI> <Q>I am a clergyman, Sir, and am not come to buy hogs.</Q> Trulliber an|&s;wered, <Q>he was &s;orry for the mi&s;take; but that he mu&s;t blame his wife;</Q> adding, &s;he was a fool, and always committed blunders. He then de&s;ired him to walk in and clean him&s;elf; that he would only fa&s;ten up the &s;tye and follow him. Adams de&s;ired leave to dry his great coat, wig and hat, by the fire, which Trulliber granted. Mrs. Trul|liber would have brought him a ba&s;on of water to wa&s;h his face; but her hu&s;band bid her be quiet, like a fool, as &s;he was, or &s;he would commit more blunders, and then directed Adams to the pump. While Adams was thus employed, Trulliber per|ceiving no great re&s;pect for the appearance of his gue&s;t, fa&s;tened the parlour-door, and now conduct|ed him into the kitchen; telling him, he believed a cup of drink would do him no harm, and whi&s;|pered

After a &s;hort &s;ilence, Adams &s;aid, <Q>I fancy, Sir, you already perceive me to be a clergyman.</Q> 'Ay, ay,' cries Trulliber grinning; <Q>I perceive you have &s;ome ca&s;&s;ock; I will not venture to caale it a whole one.</Q> Adams an&s;wered, <Q>it was indeed none of the be&s;t; but he had the misfortune to tear it about ten years ago in pa&s;&s;ing over a &s;tile.</Q> Mrs. Trulliber returning with the drink, told her hu&s;band, <Q>&s;he fancied the gentleman was a travel|ler, and that he would be glad to eat a bit,</Q> Trul|liber bid her hold her impertinent tongue; and a&s;ked her, <Q>if par&s;ons u&s;ed to travel without hor|&s;es?</Q> adding, <Q>he &s;uppo&s;ed the gentleman had none by his having no boots on.</Q> <Q>Yes, Sir, yes,</Q> &s;ays Adams, <Q>I have a hor&s;e, but I left him behind me.</Q> 'I am glad to hear you have one,' &s;ays Trulliber; <Q>for I a&s;&s;ure you I don't love to &s;ee clergymen on foot; it is not &s;eemly nor &s;uit|ing the dignity of the cloth.</Q> Here Trulliber made a long oration on the dignity of the cloth, (or rather gown) not worth much relating, till his wife had &s;pread the table and &s;et a me&s;s of porridge on it for his breakfa&s;t. He then &s;aid to Adams, <Q>I don't know, friend, how you came to caale on me; however, as you are here, if you think proper to eat a mor&s;el, you may.</Q> Adams accepted the in|vitation, and the two par&s;ons &s;at down together, Mrs. Trulliber waiting behind her hu&s;band's chair, as was, it &s;eems, her cu&s;tom. Trulliber eat hear|tily, but &s;carce put any thing in his mouth with|out finding fault with his wife's cookery. All which the poor woman bore patiently. Indeed &s;he was &s;o ab&s;olute an admirer of her hu&s;band's greatne&s;s and importance, of which &s;he had fre|quent hints from his own mouth, that &s;he almo&s;t
<PB N="198" REF="023370_0197_0FBF384D961F77A8">
carried her adoration to an opinion of infallibility. To &s;ay the truth, the par&s;on had exerci&s;ed her more ways than one, and the pious woman had &s;o well edified by her hu&s;band's &s;ermons, that &s;he had re&s;olved to receive the bad things of the world together with the good. She had indeed been at fir&s;t a little contentious; but he had long &s;ince got the better, partly by her love for this, partly by her fear for that, partly by her religion, partly by the re&s;pect he paid him&s;elf, and partly by that which &s;he received from the pari&s;h: She had, in &s;hort, ab&s;olutely &s;ubmitted, and now wor&s;hipped her hu&s;band as Sarah did Abraham, calling him (not lord but) ma&s;ter. Whil&s;t they were at the table, her hu&s;band gave her a fre&s;h example of his great|ne&s;s; for as &s;he had ju&s;t delivered a cup of ale to Adams, he &s;natched it out of his hand, and, cry|ing out, I caal'd vur&s;t, &s;wallowed down the ale. Adams deny'd it; as was referred to the wife, who, tho' her con&s;cience was on the &s;ide of Adams, dur&s;t not give it again&s;t her hu&s;band. Upon which he &s;aid, <Q>No, Sir, no. I &s;hould not have been &s;o rude to have taken it from you, if you had caal'd vur&s;t; but I'd have you know I'm a better man than to &s;uffer the be&s;t he in the kingdom to drink before me in my own hou&s;e, when I caale vur&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>As &s;oon as their breakfa&s;t was ended, Adams be|gan in the following manner: <Q>I think, Sir, it is high time to inform you of the bu&s;ine&s;s of my em|ba&s;&s;y. I am a traveller, and am pa&s;&s;ing this way in company with two young people, a lad and a dam&s;el, my pari&s;honers, towards my own cure: we &s;topt at a hou&s;e of ho&s;pitality in the pari&s;h, where they directed me to you, as having the cure.&mdash;Tho' I am but a curate,</Q> &s;ays Trulliber, <Q>I believe I am as warm as the vicar him&s;elf, or per|haps

the rector of the next pari&s;h too; I believe I could buy them both.</Q> 'Sir,' cries Adams, <Q>I re|joice thereat. Now, Sir, my bu&s;ine&s;s is, that we are by various accidents &s;tript of our money, and are not able to pay our reckoning, being &s;even &s;hillings. I therefore reque&s;t you to a&s;&s;i&s;t me with the loan of tho&s;e &s;even &s;hillings, and al&s;o &s;even &s;hillings more, which peradventure I &s;hall return to you; but if not, I am convinced you will joy|fully embrace &s;uch an opportunity of laying up a trea&s;ure in a better place than any this world af|fords.</Q></P>

A while he rolled his eyes in &s;ilence, &s;ometimes &s;urveying Adams, then his wife, then ca&s;ting them on the ground, then lifting them up to heaven. At la&s;t, he bur&s;t forth

<HEAD>CHAP. XV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>An adventure, the con&s;equence of a new in&s;tance which par&s;on Adams gave of his forgetfulne&s;s.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHEN he came back to the inn, he found Jo|&s;eph and Fanny &s;itting together. They were &s;o far from thinking his ab&s;ence long, as he had feared they would, that they never once mi&s;s'd or thought of him. Indeed I have been often a&s;|&s;ured by both, that they &s;pent the&s;e hours in a mo&s;t delightful conver&s;ation: But as I never could pre|vail on either to relate it; &s;o I cannot communicate it to the reader.</P>
<P>Adams acquainted the lovers with the ill &s;ucce&s;s of his enterprize. They were all greatly confound|ed, none being able to propo&s;e any method of de|parting, till Jo&s;eph at la&s;t advi&s;ed calling in the ho&s;t|e&s;s, and de&s;iring her to tru&s;t them: which Fanny faid &s;he de&s;paired of her doing, as &s;he was one of the &s;oure&s;t-fac'd women &s;he had ever beheld.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="023370_0202_0FBF34249CC67480">
But &s;he was agreeably di&s;appointed; for the ho|&s;te&s;s was no &s;ooner a&s;ked the que&s;tion than &s;he rea|dily agreed; and with a curt'&s;y and &s;mile wi&s;hed them a good journey. However, le&s;t Fanny's &s;kill in phy&s;iognomy &s;hould be called in que&s;tion, we will venture to a&s;&s;ign one rea&s;on, which might pro|bably incline her to this confidence and good-hu|mour. When Adams &s;aid he was going to vi&s;it his brother, he had unwittingly impo&s;ed on Jo&s;eph and Fanny; who both believed he had meant his natural brother, and not his brother in divinity; and had &s;o informed the ho&s;te&s;s on her enquiry af|ter him. Now Mr. Trulliber had by his profe&s;&s;ions of piety, by his gravity, au&s;terity, re&s;erve, and opini|on of his great wealth, &s;o great an authority in his pari&s;h, that they all lived in the utmo&s;t fear and ap|prehen&s;ion of him. It was therefore no wonder that the ho&s;te&s;s, who knew it was in his option whether &s;he &s;hould ever &s;ell another mug of drink, did not dare to affront his &s;uppo&s;ed brother by de|nying him credit.</P>
<P>They were now ju&s;t on their departure, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hen Adams recollected he had left his great coat and h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t at Mr. Trulliber's. As he was not de&s;irous of re|newing his vi&s;it, the ho&s;te&s;s her&s;elf, having no &s;er|vant at home, offered to fetch it.</P>
<P>This was an unfortunate expedient: for the ho|&s;te&s;s was &s;oon undeceived in the opinion &s;he had en|tertained of Adams, whom Trulliber abu&s;ed in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t terms, e&s;pecially when he heard he had the a&s;&s;urance to pretend to be his near relation.</P>
<P>At her return therefore, &s;he entirely changed her note. She &s;aid, <Q>Folks might be a&s;hamed of tra|velling about, and pretending to be what they were not. That taxes were high, and for her part, &s;he was obliged to pay for what &s;he had: &s;he could
<PB N="204" REF="023370_0203_0FBF3426D3463440">
not therefore po&s;&s;ibly, nor would &s;he tru&s;t any bo|dy, no not her own father. That money was ne|ver &s;carcer, and &s;he wanted to make up a &s;um. That &s;he expected therefore they &s;hould pay their reckoning before they left the hou&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>Adams was now greatly perplexed: but as he knew that he could ea&s;ily have borrowed &s;uch a &s;um in his own pari&s;h, and as he knew he would have lent it him&s;elf to any mortal in di&s;tre&s;s; &s;o he took fre&s;h courage, and &s;allied out all round the pari&s;h, but to no purpo&s;e; he returned as pennyle&s;s as he went, groaning and lamenting, that it was impo&s;&s;ible, in a country profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tianity, for a wretch to &s;tarve in the mid&s;t of his fellow-crea|tures who abounded.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t he was gone, the ho&s;te&s;s, who &s;tayed as a &s;ort of guard with Jo&s;eph and Fanny, entertain|ed them with the goodne&s;s of par&s;on Trulliber. And indeed he had not only a very good character, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to other qualities, in the neighbourhood, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> reputed a man of great charity: for tho' he never gave a farthing, he had always that word in his m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">th.</P>
<P>Adams was no &s;ooner returned the &s;econd time, than the &s;torm grew exceeding high, the ho&s;te&s;s de|claring among other things, that if they offered to &s;tir without paying her, &s;he would &s;oon overtake them with a warrant.</P>
<P>Plato and Ari&s;totle, or &s;omebody el&s;e hath &s;aid, THAT WHEN THE MOST EXQUISITE CUNNING FAILS, CHANCE OFTEN HITS THE MARK, AND THAT BY MEANS THE LEAST EXPECTED. Virgil expre&s;&s;es this very boldly:
<Q><L><HI>Turne, quod optanti divum promittere nemo</HI></L>
<L><HI>Auderet volvenda dies, en! attulit ultro.</HI></L></Q>
<PB N="205" REF="023370_0204_0FBF34284E145AD8">
I would quote more great men if I could: but my memory not permitting me, I will proceed to ex|emplify the&s;e ob&s;ervations by the following in|&s;tance.</P>
<P>There chanced (for Adams had not cunning enough to contrive it) to be at that time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the ale|hou&s;e, a fellow, who had been formerly a drum|mer in an Iri&s;h regiment, and now travelled the country as a pedlar. This man having attentive|ly li&s;tened to the di&s;cour&s;e of the ho&s;te&s;s, at la&s;t took Adams a&s;ide, and a&s;ked him what the &s;um was for which they were detained. As &s;oon as he was in|formed, he &s;ighed, and &s;aid, <Q>he was &s;orry it was &s;o much: for that he had no more than &s;ix &s;hil|lings and &s;ixpence in his pocket, which he would lend them with all his heart.</Q> Adams gave a ca|per, and cry'd out, <Q>It would do: for that he had &s;ixpence him&s;elf.</Q> And thus the&s;e poor people, who could not engage the compa&s;&s;ion of riches and piety, were at length delivered out of their di&s;tre&s;s by the charity of a poor pedlar.</P>
<P>I &s;hall refer it to my reader to make what ob&s;er|vations he plea&s;es on this incident: it is &s;ufficient for me to inform him, that after Adams and his companions had returned him a thou&s;and thanks, and told him where he might call to be repaid, they all &s;allied out of the hou&s;e without any compli|ments from their ho&s;te&s;s, or indeed without paying her any; Adams declaring, he would take particu|lar care never to call there again, and &s;he on her &s;ide a&s;&s;uring them &s;he wanted no &s;uch gue&s;ts.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A very curious adventure, in which Mr. Adams gave a much greater in&s;tance of the hone&s;t &s;implicity of his heart <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">an of his experience in the ways of this world.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>OUR travellers had walked about two miles from that inn, which they had more rea&s;on to have mi&s;taken for a ca&s;tle, that Don Quixote ever had any of tho&s;e in which he &s;ojourned; &s;eeing they had met with much difficulty in e&s;caping out of its walls; when they came to a pari&s;h, and beheld a &s;ign of invitation hanging out. A gentleman &s;at &s;moaking a pipe at the door; of whom Adams en|quired the road, and received &s;o courteous and oblig|ing an an&s;wer, accompanied with &s;o &s;miling a coun|tenace, that the good par&s;on, who&s;e heart was natu|rally di&s;po&s;ed to love and affection, began to a&s;k &s;e|veral other que&s;tions; particularly the name of the pari&s;h, and who was the owner of a large hou&s;e who&s;e front they then had in pro&s;pect. The gen|tleman an&s;wered as obligingly as before: and as to the hou&s;e, acquainted him it was his own. He then proceeded in the following manner: <Q>Sir, I pre|&s;ume by your habit you are a clergyman: and as you are travelling on foot, I &s;uppo&s;e a gla&s;s of good beer will not be di&s;agreeable to you; and I can recommend my landlord's within, as &s;ome of the be&s;t in all this country. What &s;ay you, will you halt a little and let us take a pipe together? There is no better tobacco in the kingdom.</Q> This pro|po&s;al was not di&s;plea&s;ing to Adams, who had allay|ed his thir&s;t that day with no better liquor than what Mrs. Trulliber's cellar had produced; and which
<PB N="207" REF="023370_0206_0FBF342E446E8D50">
was indeed little &s;uperior either in richne&s;s or fla|vour to that which di&s;tilled from tho&s;e grains her generous hu&s;band be&s;towed on his hogs. Having therefore abundantly thanked the gentleman for his kind invitation, and bid Jo&s;eph and Fanny fol|low him, he entered the ale-hou&s;e, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a large loaf and chee&s;e, and a pitcher of beer, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> truly an&s;wered the character given of it, being &s;et be|fore them, the three travellers fell to eating with appetites infinitely more voracious than are to be found at the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite eating-hou&s;es in the pari&s;h of St. James's.</P>
<P>The gentleman expre&s;&s;ed great delight in the hearty and chearful behaviour of Adams; and par|ticularly in the familiarity with which he conver|&s;ed with Jo&s;eph and Fanny, whom he often called his children, a term he explained to mean no more than his pari&s;hioners; &s;aying, he looked on all tho&s;e whom God had entru&s;ted to his cure, to &s;tand to him in that relation. The gentleman, &s;haking him by the hand, highly applauded tho&s;e &s;entiments. 'They are indeed,' &s;ays he, <Q>the true principles of a chri&s;tian divine; and I heartily wi&s;h they were univer&s;al: but on the contrary, I am &s;orry to &s;ay the par&s;on of our pari&s;h, in&s;tead of e&s;teeming his poor pari&s;hioners as a part of his family, &s;eems rather to con&s;ider them as not of the &s;ame &s;pecies with him&s;elf. He &s;eldom &s;peaks to any, unle&s;s &s;ome few of the riche&s;t of us; nay, indeed he will not move his hat to the others. I often laugh, when I behold him on Sundays &s;trutting along the church-yard like a turky-cock, through rows of his pari&s;hioners; who bow to him with as much &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and are as unregarded as a &s;et of &s;ervile courtiers by the proude&s;t prince in Chri&s;tendom. But if &s;uch
<PB N="208" REF="023370_0207_0FBF342F190AE380">
temporal pride is ridiculous, &s;urely the &s;piritual is odious and dete&s;table: if &s;uch a puffed-up emp|ty human bladder, &s;trutting in princely robes, ju&s;t moves one's deri&s;ion; &s;urely in the habit of a prie&s;t it mu&s;t rai&s;e out &s;corn.</Q></P>
<P><Q><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> an&s;wer'd Adams, your opinion is right <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> I hope &s;uch examples are rare.

The gentleman would not be denied; and informing him&s;elf how far they were travelling, he &s;aid it was too long a journey to take on foot, and begged that they would favour him, by &s;uffering him to lend them a &s;ervant and hor&s;es; adding withal, that if they would do him the plea&s;ure of their company only two days, he would furni&s;h them with his coach and &s;ix.

by the hand, with mo&s;t affectionate looks and &s;miles at each other, and after appointing the hor&s;es at &s;even the next morning, the gentleman took his leave of them, and departed to his own hou&s;e. Adams and his companions returned to the table, where the par&s;on &s;moaked another pipe, and then they all retired to re&s;t.</P>
<P>Mr. Adams ro&s;e very early, and called Jo&s;eph out of his bed, between whom a very fierce di&s;pute en&s;ued, whether Fanny &s;hould ride behind Jo&s;eph, or behind the gentleman's &s;ervant; Jo&s;eph in&s;i&s;ted on it that he was perfectly recovered, and was as capable of taking care of Fanny as any other per&s;on could be. But Adams would not agree to it, and declared he would not tru&s;t her behind him; for that he was weaker than he imagined him&s;elf to be.</P>
<P>This di&s;pute continued a long time, and had be|gun to be very hot, when a &s;ervant arrived from their good friend to acquaint them, that he was unfortu|nately prevented from lending them any hor&s;es; for that his groom had, unknown to him, put his whole &s;table under a cour&s;e of phy&s;ick.</P>
<P>This advice pre&s;ently &s;truck the two di&s;putants dumb; Adams cried out, <Q>was ever any thing &s;o unlucky as this poor gentleman? I prote&s;t I am more &s;orry on his account than my own. You &s;ee, Jo&s;eph, how this good-natur'd man is treated by his &s;ervants; one lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ks up his linen, another phy&s;icks his hor&s;es; and I &s;uppo&s;e by his being at this hou&s;e la&s;t night, the butler had locked up his cellar. Ble&s;s us! how good-nature is u&s;ed in this world! I prote&s;t I am more concerned on his account than my own.</Q> 'So am I,' cries Jo|&s;eph; <Q>not that I am much troubled about walk|ing on foot; all my concern is, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> we &s;hall get out of the hou&s;e; unle&s;s God &s;ends another ped|lar

But certainly this gentleman has &s;uch an affection for you, that he would lend you a larger &s;um than we owe here; which is not above four or five &s;hillings.</Q> 'Very true, child,' an&s;wered Adams; <Q>I will write a letter to him, and will even venture to &s;ollicit him for three hal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">-crown<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">; there will be no harm in having two or three &s;hillings in our pockets; as we have full for|ty miles to travel, we may po&s;&s;ibly have occa&s;ion for them.</Q></P>
<P>Fanny being now ri&s;en, Jo&s;eph paid her a vi&s;it, and left Adams to write his letter, which having fini&s;hed, he di&s;patched a boy with it to the gentle|man, and then &s;eated him&s;elf by the door, lighted his pipe, and betook him&s;elf to meditation.</P>
<P>The boy &s;taying longer than &s;eemed to be nece&s;|&s;ary, Jo&s;eph, who with Fanny was now returned to the par&s;on, expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome apprehen&s;ions, that the gentleman's &s;teward had locked up his pur&s;e too. To which Adams an&s;wered, <Q>It might very po&s;&s;i|bly be; and he &s;hould wonder at no liberties which the devil might put into the head of a wicked &s;er|vant to take with &s;o worthy a ma&s;ter: but added, that as the &s;um was &s;o &s;mall, &s;o noble a gentleman would be ea&s;ily able to procure it in the pari&s;h; though he had it not in his own pocket.</Q> Indeed, &s;ays he, <Q>if it was four or five guineas, or any &s;uch large quantity of money, it might be a different matter.</Q></P>
<P>They were now &s;at down to breakfa&s;t over &s;ome toa&s;t and ale, when the boy returned, and informed them, 'that the gentleman was not at home.' <Q>Ve|ry well!</Q> cries Adams; <Q>but why, child, did you not &s;tay 'till his return? Go back again, my good boy, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> for his coming home: he cannot be gone far, as his hor&s;es are all &s;ick; and be&s;ides he

had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> intention to go abroad; for he invited us to &s;pend this day and to-morrow at his hou&s;e. Therefore go back, child, and tarry 'till his return home.</Q> The me&s;&s;enger departed, and was back again with great expedition; bringing an account, that the gentleman was gone a long journey, and would not be at home again this month. At the&s;e words Adams &s;eemed greatly confounded, &s;aying, <Q>This mu&s;t be a &s;udden accident, as the &s;ickne&s;s or death of a relation, or &s;ome &s;uch unfore&s;een misfortune; and then turning to Jo&s;eph, cried, I wi&s;h you had reminded me to have borrowed this money la&s;t night.</Q> Jo&s;eph &s;miling, an&s;wer|ed, <Q>he was very much deceived, if the gentleman would not have found &s;ome excu&s;e to avoid lend|ing it. I own,</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>I was never much plea&s;|ed with his profe&s;&s;ing &s;o much kindne&s;s for you at fir&s;t &s;ight: for I have heard the gentlemen of our cloth in London tell many &s;uch &s;tories of their ma&s;ters. But when the boy brought the me&s;&s;age back of his not being at home, I pre&s;ently knew what would follow; for whenever a man of fa&s;hi|on doth not care to fulfil his promi&s;es, the cu&s;tom is, to order his &s;ervants that he will never be at home to the per&s;on &s;o promi&s;ed. In London they call it denying him. I have denyed Sir Thomas Booby above an hundred times; and when the man hath danced attendance for about a month, or &s;ometimes longer, he is acquainted in the end, that the gentleman is gone out of town, and could do nothing in the bu&s;ine&s;s.</Q> 'Good lord!' &s;ays A|dams, <Q>what wickedne&s;s is there in the chri&s;tian world?

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A dialogue between Mr. Abraham Adams and his ho&s;t, which by the di&s;agreement in their opinions, &s;eemed to threaten an unlucky cata&s;trophe, had it not been timely prevented by the return of the lovers.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><Q>SIR, &s;aid the ho&s;t, I a&s;&s;ure you, you are not the fir&s;t to whom our &s;quire hath promi&s;ed more than he hath performed. He is &s;o famous for this practice, that his word will not be taken for much by tho&s;e who know him. I remember a young fellow whom he promi&s;ed his parents to make an exci&s;eman. The poor people, who could ill afford it, bred their &s;on to writing, ac|counts, and other learning, to qualify him for the place, and the boy held up his head above his condition with the&s;e hopes: nor would he go to plough, nor to any other kind of work; and went con&s;tantly dre&s;t as fine as could be, with two clean holland &s;hirts a week, and this for &s;everal years; 'till at la&s;t he followed the &s;quire up to London, thinking there to mind him of his promi&s;es: but he could never get &s;ight of him. So that being out of money and bu&s;ine&s;s, he fell into evil com|pany, and wicked cour&s;es: and in the end came to a &s;entence of tran&s;portation, the news of which broke the mother's heart. I will tell you another true &s;tory of him: There was a neighbour of mine, a farmer, who had two &s;ons whom he bred up to the bu&s;ine&s;s. Pretty lads they were; nothing would &s;erve the &s;quire, but that the younge&s;t mu&s;t be made a par&s;on. Upon which, he per&s;uaded the father to &s;end him to &s;chool, promi&s;ing, that he would afterwards maintain
<PB N="217" REF="023370_0216_0FBF34488EE94E78">
him at the univer&s;ity; and when he was of a pro|per age, give him a living. But after the lad had been &s;even years at &s;chool, and his father brought him to the &s;quire with a letter from his ma&s;ter, that he was fit for the univer&s;ity; the &s;quire in|&s;tead of minding his promi&s;e, or &s;ending him thi|ther at his expence, only told his father, that the young man was a fine &s;cholar; and it was a pity he could not afford to keep him at Oxford for four or five years more, by which time, if he could get him a curacy, he might have him ordained. The farmer &s;aid, he was not a man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ufficient to do any &s;uch thing.</Q> 'Why then,' an&s;wered the &s;quire, <Q>I am very &s;orry you have given him &s;o much learning; for if he cannot get his living by that, it will rather &s;poil him for any thing el&s;e; and your other &s;on who can hardly write his name, will do more at ploughing and &s;owing, and is in a better condition than he: and indeed &s;o it proved; for the poor lad, not finding friends to maintain him in his learning as he had expect|ed, and being unwilling to work, fell to drinking, though he was a very &s;ober lad before; and, in a &s;hort time, partly with grief, and partly with good liquor, fell into a con&s;umption and died. Nay; I can tell you more &s;till: There was another, a young woman, and the hand&s;ome&s;t in all this neighbourhood, whom he inticed up to London, promi&s;ing to make her a gentlewoman to one of your women of quality: but in&s;tead of keeping his word, we have &s;ince heard, after having a child by her him&s;elf, &s;he became a common whore; then kept a coffee-hou&s;e in Covent-gar|den; and a little after died of the French di&s;tem|per in a goal. I could tell you many more &s;to|ries; but how do you imagine he &s;erved me my|&s;elf?
<PB N="218" REF="023370_0217_0FBF344BE4342C58">
You mu&s;t know, Sir, I was bred a &s;ea-far|ing man, and have been many voyages; 'till at la&s;t I came to be a ma&s;ter of a &s;hip my&s;elf, and was in a fair way of making a fortune, when I was attacked by one of tho&s;e cur&s;ed Guarda-Co&s;|tas, who took our &s;hips before the beginning of the war; and after a fight, wherein I lo&s;t the greater part of my crew, my rigging being all de|moli&s;hed, and two &s;hots received between wind and water, I was forced to &s;trike. The villains carried off my &s;hip, a brigantine of an hundred and fifty tons, a pretty creature &s;he was, and put me, a man and a boy, into a little bad pink, in which, with much ado, we at la&s;t made Falmouth; tho' I believe the Spaniards did not imagine &s;he could po&s;&s;ibly live a day at &s;ea. Upon my re|turn hither, where my wife, who was of this country, then lived, the &s;quire told me he was &s;o plea&s;ed with the defence I had made again&s;t the enemy, that he did not fear getting me promoted to a lieutenancy of a man of war, if I would ac|cept of it; which I thankfully a&s;&s;ured him I would. Well, Sir, two or three years pa&s;s'd, during which I had many repeated promi&s;es, not only from the &s;quire, but (as he told me) from the lords of the admiralty. He never returned from London, but I was a&s;&s;ured I might be &s;atisfied now, for I was certain of the fir&s;t vacancy; and what &s;urpri&s;es me &s;till, when I reflect on it, the&s;e a&s;&s;urances were given me with no le&s;s confidence, after &s;o many di&s;appointments, than at fir&s;t. At la&s;t, Sir grow|ing weary, and &s;omewhat &s;u&s;picious, after &s;o much delay, I wrote to a friend in London, who I knew had &s;ome acquaintance at the be&s;t hou&s;e in the admiralty, and de&s;ired him to back the &s;quire's intere&s;t: for indeed, I feared he had &s;o|licited
<PB N="219" REF="023370_0218_0FBF344F53AA5CE0">
the affair with more coolne&s;s than he pre|tended.&mdash;And what an&s;wer do you think my friend &s;ent me?&mdash;Truly, Sir, he acquainted me, that the &s;quire had never mentioned my name at the admiralty in his life; and unle&s;s I had much faithfuller intere&s;t, advi&s;ed me to give over my preten&s;ions, which I immediately did; and, with the concurrence of my wife, re&s;olved to &s;et up an ale-hou&s;e, where you are heartily welcome: and &s;o my &s;ervice to you; and may the &s;quire, and all &s;uch &s;neaking ra&s;cals, go to the devil toge|ther.</Q> 'O fie.' &s;ays Adams, <Q>O fie! He is in|deed a wicked man; but G&mdash;will, I hope, turn his heart to repentance. Nay if he could but once &s;ee the meanne&s;s of this dete&s;table vice; would he but once reflect that he is one of the mo&s;t &s;candalous as well as pernicious liars; &s;ure he mu&s;t de&s;pi&s;e him&s;elf to &s;o intolerable a degree, that it would be impo&s;&s;ible for him to continue a moment in &s;uch a cour&s;e. And, to confe&s;s the truth, notwith&s;tanding the ba&s;ene&s;s of this cha|racter, which he hath too well de&s;erved, he hath in his countenance &s;ufficient &s;ymptoms of that <HI>bona indoles,</HI> that &s;weetne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition which furni&s;hes out a good chri&s;tian.</Q> <Q>Ah! ma&s;ter, ma&s;ter!</Q> (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ays the ho&s;t) <Q>if you had travelled as far as I have, and conver&s;ed with the many nati|ons where I have traded, you would not give any credit to a man's countenance.

From them I learn what I a&s;&s;erted ju&s;t now, that nature generally imprints &s;uch a portraiture of the mind in the countenance, that a &s;kilful phy&s;iogno|mi&s;t will rarely be deceived. I pre&s;ume you have never read the &s;tory of Socrates, to this pur|po&s;e, and therefore I will tell it you. A cer|tain phy&s;iognomi&s;t a&s;&s;erted of Socrates that he plainly di&s;covered by his features that he was a rogue in his nature. A character &s;o contrary to the tenor of all this great man's actions and the generally received opinion concerning him, in|cen&s;ed the boys of Athens, &s;o that they threw &s;tones at the phy&s;iognomi&s;t, and would have de|moli&s;hed him for his ignorance, had not Socrates him&s;elf prevented them by confe&s;&s;ing the truth of his ob&s;ervations, and acknowledging, that though he corrected his di&s;po&s;ition by philo&s;ophy, he was indeed naturally as inclined to vice as had been predicated of him. Now, pray re&s;olve me,&mdash;How &s;hould a man know this &s;tory, if he had not read it?</Q> 'Well, ma&s;ter,' &s;aid the ho&s;t, <Q>and what &s;ignifies it whether a man knows it or no? He who goes abroad as I have done, will always have opportunities enough of knowing the world with|out troubling his head with Socrates, or any &s;uch fellows.</Q>&mdash;'Friend,' cries Adams, <Q>if a man &s;hould &s;ail round the world, and anchor in every harbour of it, without learning, he would return home as ignorant as he went out.</Q><Q> Lord help you,</Q> an&s;wered the ho&s;t, <Q>there was my boat&s;wain, poor fellow he could &s;carce either write or read, and yet he would navigate a &s;hip with any ma&s;ter of a man of war; and a very pretty knowledge of trade he had too.</Q> 'Trade,' an&s;wered Adams. <Q>As Ari&s;totle proves in his fir&s;t chapter of politics,

'It is a dirty news-paper,' repli|ed the ho&s;t, <Q>which hath been given away all over the nation for the&s;e many years, to abu&s;e trade and hone&s;t men, which I would not &s;uffer to lye on my table, though it hath been offered me for nothing.</Q> 'Not I truly,' &s;aid Adams, <Q>I never write any thing but &s;ermons; and I a&s;&s;ure you I am no enemy to trade, whil&s;t it is con&s;i&s;tent with hone&s;ty; nay, I have always looked on the trade&s;|man as a very valuable member of &s;ociety, and perhaps, inferior to none but the man of learning.</Q> 'No, I believe he is not, nor to him neither,' an|&s;wered the ho&s;t. <Q>Of what el&s;e would learning be in a country without trade!

Who clothes you with piety, meekne&s;s, humility, charity, patience, and all the other chri&s;tian virtues? Who feeds your &s;ouls with the milk of brotherly love, and diets them with all the dainty food of holine&s;s, which at once clean&s;es them of all impure carnal affections, and fattens them with the truly rich Spirit of grace?&mdash;Who doth this?</Q> 'Ay, who indeed!' cries the ho&s;t; <Q>for I do not remember ever to have &s;een

<ARGUMENT>
<P>A di&s;cour&s;e between the poet and players of no other u&s;e in this hi&s;tory, but to divert the reader.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>BEFORE we proceed any farther in this trage|dy, we &s;hall leave Mr. Jo&s;eph and Mr. A|dams to them&s;elves, and imitate the wi&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the &s;tage; who, in the mid&s;t of a grave action, entertain you with &s;ome excellent piece of &s;atire or
<PB N="96" REF="023370_0317_0FBF6570605EB288">
humour called a dance. Which piece indeed is therefore danced, and not &s;poke, as it is delivered to the audience by per&s;ons who&s;e thinking faculty is by mo&s;t people held to lie in their heels; and to whom, as well as heroes, who think with their hands, nature hath only given heads for the &s;ake of conformity, and as they are of u&s;e in dancing, to hang their hats on.</P>
<P>The poet, addre&s;&s;ing the player, proceeded thus: 'As I was &s;aying,' (for they had been at this di&s;|cour&s;e all the time of the engagement above &s;tairs) <Q>the rea&s;on you have no good new plays is evident; it is from your di&s;couragement of authors. Gen|tlemen will not write, Sir, they will not write without the expectation of fame or profit, or per|haps, both. Plays are like trees which will not grow without nouri&s;hment; but, like mu&s;hrooms, they &s;hoot up &s;pontaneou&s;ly, as it were, in a rich &s;oil. The mu&s;es, like vines, may be pruned, but not with a hatchet. The town like a peevi&s;h child, knows not what it de&s;ires, and is always be&s;t plea&s;ed with a rattle. A farce writer hath indeed &s;ome chance for &s;ucce&s;s; but they have lo&s;t all ta&s;te for the &s;ublime. Though I believe one rea&s;on of their depravity is the badne&s;s of the actors. If a man writes like an angel, Sir, tho&s;e fellows know not how to give a &s;entiment utter|ance.</Q> 'Not &s;o fa&s;t,' &s;ays the player, <Q>the mo|dern actors are as good at lea&s;t as their authors, nay, they come nearer their illu&s;trious predece&s;&s;ors, and I expect a Booth on the &s;tage again, &s;ooner than a Shake&s;pear or an Otway; and indeed, I may turn your ob&s;ervation again&s;t you, and with truth &s;ay, that the rea&s;on no authors are encouraged, is, becau&s;e we have no good new plays.</Q> <Q>I have not affirmed the contrary,</Q> &s;aid the poet; <Q>but I

No, Sir, if we had &s;ix &s;uch actors as you, we &s;hould &s;oon rival the Bettertons and Sandfords of former times; for, without a compliment to you, I think it im|po&s;&s;ible for any one to have excelled you in mo&s;t of your parts. Nay, it is a &s;olemn truth, and I have heard many, and all great judges, expre&s;s as much; and you will pardon me if I tell you, I think every time I have &s;een you lately, you have con&s;tantly acquired &s;ome new excellence, like a &s;nowball. You have deceived me in my e&s;tima|tion of perfection, and have outdone what I thought inimitable.</Q> 'You are as little intere&s;ted,' an&s;wered the player, <Q>in what I have &s;aid of other poets; for d&mdash;n me if there are not many &s;trokes, ay, whole &s;cenes, in your la&s;t tragedy, which at lea&s;t equal Shake&s;pear. There is a delicacy of &s;entiment a dignity of expre&s;&s;ion in it, which I will own many of our gentlemen did not do adequate ju&s;tice to. To confe&s;s the truth, they are bad enough, and I pity an author who is pre|&s;ent at the murder of his works.&mdash;</Q><Q>Nay it is but &s;eldom that it can happen,</Q> returned the poet, <Q>the works of mo&s;t modern authors, like dead-born children, cannot be murdered. It is &s;uch wretch|ed half-begotten, half-wit, lifele&s;s, &s;piritle&s;s, low, groveling &s;tuff, that I almo&s;t pity the actor who is obliged to get it by heart, which mu&s;t be almo&s;t as difficult to remember as words in a language you do not under&s;tand.</Q> 'I am &s;ure,' &s;aid the player, <Q>if the &s;entences have little meaning when they are writ, when they are &s;poken they have le&s;s.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Containing the exhortations of per&s;on Adams to his friend in affliction: calculated for the in&s;truction and improvement of the reader.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>JOSEPH no &s;ooner came perfectly to him&s;elf, than perceiving his mi&s;tre&s;s gone, he bewailed her lo&s;s with groans, which would have pierced any heart but tho&s;e which are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by &s;ome people, and are made of a certain compo&s;ition, not unlike flint in its hardne&s;s, and other properties; for you may &s;trike fire from them, which will dart through the eyes, but they can never di&s;til one drop of water the &s;ame way. His own, poor youth was of a &s;oft|er compo&s;ition: and, at tho&s;e words, O my dear Fanny! O my love! &s;hall I never, never &s;ee thee more? his eyes overflowed with tears, which would have become any thing but a hero. In a word, his de|&s;pair was more ea&s;y to be conceived than related&mdash;</P>
<P>Mr. Adams, after many groans, &s;itting with his back to Jo&s;eph, began thus in a &s;orrowful tone: <Q>You cannot imagine, my good child, that I en|tirely blame the&s;e fir&s;t agonies of your grief; for when misfortunes attack us by &s;urprize, it mu&s;t require infinitely more learning than you are ma&s;|ter of to re&s;i&s;t them: but it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of a man and a chri&s;tian, to &s;ummon rea&s;on as quickly as he can to his aid; and &s;he will pre&s;ently teach him patience and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. Be comforted, therefore, child, I &s;ay be comforted. It is true you have lo&s;t the prettie&s;t, kinde&s;t, lovelie&s;t, &s;weet|e&s;t young woman, one with whom you might have expected to have lived in happine&s;s, virtue and innocence.

your&s;elf many little darlings, who would have been the delight of your youth, and the com|fort of your age. You have not only lo&s;t her, but have rea&s;on to fear the utmo&s;t violence which lu&s;t and power can inflict upon her.

We did not make our&s;elves; but the &s;ame power which made us, rules over us, and we are ab&s;olutely at his di&s;po&s;al; he may do with us what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> plea&s;es, nor have we any right to complain.

This rea&s;on, or indeed rather the idea which it rai&s;|ed of the re&s;toration of his mi&s;tre&s;s, had more ef|fect than all which the per&s;on had &s;aid before, and for a moment abated his agonies: but when his fears &s;ufficiently &s;et before his eyes the danger that poor creature was in, his grief returned again with repeated violence, nor could Adams in the lea&s;t a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">wage it; though it may be doubted in his behalf, whether Socrates him&s;elf could have prevailed any better.</P>

<P>NEITHER the facetious dialogue which pa&s;|&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> between the poet and player, nor the grave and truly &s;olemn di&s;cour&s;e of Mr. Adams, will, we conceive, make the reader &s;ufficient amends for the anxiety which he mu&s;t have felt on the account of poor Fanny, whom we left in &s;o de|plorable a condition.

<P>The man of war having conveyed his charming prize out of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a little before day, made the utmo&s;t expedition in his power towards the &s;quire's hou&s;e, where this delicate creature was to be offered up a &s;acrifice to the lu&s;t of a ravi&s;her.

luxury which would be her fortune with a man who would have the inclination and power too, to give her whatever her utmo&s;t wi&s;hes could de&s;ire; and told her he doubted not but &s;he would &s;oon look kinder on him, as the in&s;trument of her hap|pine&s;s, and de&s;pi&s;e that pitiful fellow whom her ignorance only could make her fond of. She an&s;wer|ed, &s;he knew not whom he meant; &s;he never was fond of any pitiful fellow. <Q>Are you affronted, Ma|dam,</Q> &s;ays <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <Q>at my calling him &s;o? but what better can be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aid of one in a livery, notwith&s;tand|ing your fondne&s;s for him?</Q> She returned, that &s;he did not under&s;tand him, that the man had been her fellow-&s;ervant, and &s;he believed was as hone&s;t a creature as any alive; but as for fondne&s;s of men&mdash;'I warrant ye,' cries the captain, <Q>we &s;hall find means to per&s;uade you to be fond; and I advi&s;e you to yield to gentle ones; for you may be a&s;|&s;ured that it is not in your power, by any &s;trug|gles whatever, to pre&s;erve your virginity two hours longer.

The captain told her, if &s;he per&s;i&s;ted in her vociferation, he would find a means of &s;topping her mouth.

A hor&s;eman now appeared in the road, upon which the captain threatened her violently if &s;he complained; however, the
<PB N="107" REF="023370_0328_0FBF658EA2993550">
moment they approached each other, &s;he begged him with the utmo&s;t earne&s;tne&s;s to relieve a di&s;tre&s;|&s;ed creature who was in the hands of a ravi&s;her. The fellow &s;topt at tho&s;e words; but the captain a&s;&s;ured him it was his wife, and that he was carry|ing her home from her adulterer: which &s;o &s;atis|fied the fellow who was an old one, (and perhaps a married one too) that he wi&s;hed him a good jour|ney, and rode on. He was no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> pa&s;t, than the captain abu&s;ed her violently <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> breaking his commands, and threatened to gagg her, when two more hor&s;emen, armed with pi&s;tols, came into the road ju&s;t before them. She again &s;olicited their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and the captain told the &s;ame &s;tory as be|fore. Upon which one &s;aid to the other&mdash;<Q>That's a charming wench! Jack; I wi&s;h I had been in the fellow's place whoever he is.</Q> But the other, in&s;tead of an&s;wering him, cried out eagerly, 'Zounds, I know her:' and then turning to her, &s;aid, 'Sure you are not Fanny Goodwill.'&mdash;<Q>In|deed, indeed I am,</Q> &s;he cried&mdash;<Q>O John, I know you now&mdash;Heaven hath &s;ent you to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to deliver me from this wicked man, who is car|rying me away for his vile purpo&s;es&mdash;O for God's &s;ake re&s;cue me from him.</Q> A fierce dia|logue immediately en&s;ued between the captain and the&s;e two men, who being both armed with pi&s;tols, and the chariot which they attended being now arrived, the captain &s;aw both force and &s;tratagem were vain, and endeavoured to make his e&s;cape; in which however he could not &s;ucceed. The gentleman who rode in the chariot ordered it to &s;top, and with an air of authority examined <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the merits of the cau&s;e; of which being advert<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> by Fanny, who&s;e credit was confirmed by the fel|low who knew her, he ordered the captain, who
<PB N="108" REF="023370_0329_0FBF65977315F120">
was all bloody from his encounter at the inn, to be conveyed as a pri&s;oner behind the chariot, and very gallantry took Fanny into it; for, to &s;ay he truth, this gentleman (who was no other than the celebrated Mr. Peter Pounce, and who preceded the lady Booby only a few miles, by &s;etting out earlier in the morning) was a very gallant per&s;on, and loved a pretty girl better than any thing, be&s;ides his own money, or the money of other people.</P>
<P>The cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> now proceeded towards the inn, which, as Fanny was informed, lay in their way, and where it arrived that very time where the poet and player were di&s;puting below &s;tairs, and Adams and Jo&s;eph were di&s;cour&s;ing back to back above: ju&s;t at that period to which we brought them both in the two preceeding chapters, the chariot &s;topt at the door, and in an in&s;tant Fanny leaping from it, ran up to her Jo&s;eph.&mdash;O reader, conceive if thou can'&s;t, the joy which fired the brea&s;ts of the&s;e lovers on this meeting, and if thy own heart doth not &s;ympathetically a&s;&s;i&s;t thee in this conception, I pity thee &s;incerely from my own: for let the hard-heart|ed villain know this, that there is a plea&s;ure in a tender &s;en&s;ation beyond any which he is capable of ta&s;ting.</P>
<P>Peter being informed by Fanny of the pre&s;ence of Adams, &s;topt to &s;ee him, and receive his homage; for, as Peter was an hypocrite, a &s;ort of people whom Mr. Adams never &s;aw through, the one paid that re&s;pect to his &s;eeming goodne&s;s which the o|ther believed to be paid to his riches; hence Mr. Adams was &s;o much his favourite, that he once <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> him four pounds thirteen &s;hillings and &s;ixpence to prevent his going to goal, on no greater &s;ecurity than a bond and judgment, which probably he
<PB N="109" REF="023370_0330_0FBF65992591FB20">
would have made no u&s;e of, tho' the money had not been (as it was) paid exactly at the time.</P>
<P>It is not perhaps ea&s;y to de&s;cribe the figure of Adams; he had ri&s;en in &s;uch a hurry, that he had on neither breeches, garters, nor &s;tockings; nor had he taken from his head a red &s;potted handker|chief, which by night bound his wig turned in&s;ide out, around his head. He had on his torn ca&s;&s;ock, and his great coat; but as the remainder of his ca&s;&s;ock hung down below his great coat; &s;o did a &s;mall &s;tripe of white, or rather whiti&s;h linen, ap|pear below that; to which we may add the &s;everal colours which appeared on his face, where a long pi&s;s-burnt beard &s;erved to retain the liquor of the &s;tone-pot, and that of a blacker hue which di&s;til|led from the mop.&mdash;This figure which Fanny had delivered from his captivity, was no &s;ooner &s;pied by Peter, than it di&s;ordered the compo&s;ed gravity of his mu&s;cles; however he advi&s;ed him immediatel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> to make him&s;elf clean, nor would ac|cept his homage in that pickle.</P>
<P>The poet and player no &s;ooner &s;aw the captain in captivity, than they began to con&s;ider of their own &s;afety, of which flight pre&s;ented it&s;elf as the only means; they therefore both of them mounted the poet's hor&s;e, and made the mo&s;t expeditious retreat in their power.</P>
<P>The ho&s;t, who well knew Mr. Pounce, and lady Booby's livery, was not a little &s;urprized at this change of the &s;cene, nor was his confu&s;ion much helped by his wife, who was now ju&s;t ri&s;en, and having heard from him the account of what had pa&s;t, comforted him with a decent number of fools and blockheads; a&s;ked him why he did not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> her; and told him, he would never leave following
<PB N="110" REF="023370_0331_0FBF659AA933C290">
the non&s;en&s;ical dictates of his own num&s;cull, till &s;he and her family were ruined.</P>
<P>Jo&s;eph being informed of the captain's arrival, and &s;eeing his Fanny now in &s;afety, quitted her a moment, and running down &s;tairs, went directly to him, and, &s;tripping off his coat, challenged him to fight; but the captain refu&s;ed, &s;aying, he did not under&s;tand boxing. He then gra&s;ped a cudgel in one hand, and catching the captain by the collar in the other, gave him a mo&s;t &s;evere drubbing, and ended with telling him, he had now had &s;ome re|venge for what his dear Fanny had &s;uffered.</P>
<P>When Mr. Pounce had a little regaled him&s;elf with &s;ome provi&s;ion which he had in his chariot, and Mr. Adams had put on the be&s;t appearance his clothes would allow him, Pounce ordered the captain into his pre&s;ence; for he &s;aid he was guilty of felony, and the next ju&s;tice of peace &s;hould commit him: but the &s;ervants (who&s;e appetite for revenge is &s;oon &s;atisfied) being &s;ufficiently content|ed with the drubbing which Jo&s;eph had inflicted on him, and which was indeed of no very mode|rate kind, had &s;uffered him to go off, which he did, threatening a &s;evere revenge again&s;t Jo&s;eph, which I have never heard he thought proper to take.</P>
<P>The mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e made her voluntary ap|pearance before Mr. Pounce, and with a thou&s;and curt&s;ies told him. <Q>&s;he hoped his honour would pardon her hu&s;band, who was a very non&s;en&s;e man, for the &s;ake of his poor family; that indeed if he could be ruined alone, &s;he &s;hould be very willing of it; for becau&s;e as why, his wor&s;hip ve|ry well knew he de&s;erved it: but &s;he had three <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;mall children, who were not capable to get their own living; and if her hu&s;band was &s;ent to goal, they mu&s;t all come to the pari&s;h; for &s;he
<PB N="111" REF="023370_0332_0FBF659C2CFFED90">
was a poor weak woman, continually a breeding, and had no time to work for them. She there|fore hoped his honour would take it into his wor|&s;hip's con&s;ideration, and forgive her hu&s;band this time; for &s;he was &s;ure he never intended, any harm to man, woman, or child; and if it was not for that block-head of his own, the man in &s;ome things was well enough; for &s;he had had three children by him in le&s;s than three years, and was almo&s;t ready to cry out the fourth time.</Q> She would have proceeded in this manner much longer, had not Peter &s;topt her tongue, by telling her he had nothing to &s;ay to her hu&s;band, nor her neither. So, as Adams and the re&s;t had a&s;&s;ured her of forgive|ne&s;s, &s;he cried and curt&s;ied out of the room.</P>
<P>Mr. Pounce was de&s;irous that Fanny &s;hould con|tinue her journey with him in the chariot; but &s;he ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed, &s;aying &s;he would ride behind Jo|&s;eph, on a hor&s;e which one of lady Booby's &s;ervants had equipped him with. But alas! when the hor&s;e appeared, it was found to be no other than that iden|tical bea&s;t which Mr. Adams had left behind him at the inn, and which the&s;e hone&s;t fellows, who knew him, had redeemed. Indeed whatever hor&s;e they had provided for Jo&s;eph, they would have pre|vailed with him to mount none, no not even to ride before his beloved Fanny, till the per&s;on was &s;up|plied; much le&s;s would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e deprive his friend of the bea&s;t which belonged to him, and which he knew the moment he &s;aw, tho' Adams did not: however, when he was reminded of the affair, and told that they had brought the hor&s;e with them which he left behind, he an&s;wered&mdash;Ble&s;s me! and &s;o I did.</P>
<P>Adams was very de&s;irous that Jo&s;eph and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;hould mount this hor&s;e, and declared he could very
<PB N="112" REF="023370_0333_0FBF65A2E5D0B1D0">
ea&s;ily walk home. 'If I walked alone,' &s;ays he, <Q>I would wage a &s;hilling, that the Pede&s;trian out|&s;tripped the Eque&s;trian travellers: but as I intend to take the company of a pipe, peradventure I may be an hour later.</Q> One of the &s;ervants whi&s;per|ed Jo&s;eph to take him at his word, and &s;uffer the old put to walk if he would: This propo&s;al was an|&s;wered with an angry look and a peremptory refu|&s;al by Jo&s;eph, who catching Fanny up in his arms, aver'd he would rather carry her home in that man|ner, than take away Mr. Adams's hor&s;e, and per|mit him to walk on foot.</P>
<P>Perhaps, reader, thou ha&s;t &s;een a conte&s;t between two gentlemen, or two ladies quickly decided, tho' they have both a&s;&s;erted they would not eat &s;uch a nice mor&s;el, and each in&s;i&s;ted on the other's accept|ing it; but in reality both were de&s;irous to &s;wallow it them&s;elves. Do not therefore conclude hence, that this di&s;pute would have come to a &s;peedy deci|&s;ion: for here both parties were heartily in earne&s;t, and it is very probable, they would have remained in the inn-yard to this day, had not the good Peter Pounce put a &s;top to it; for finding he had no lon|ger hopes of &s;atisfying his old appetite with Fanny, and being de&s;irous of having &s;ome one to whom he might communicate his grandeur, he told the per&s;on he would convey him home in his chariot. This favour was by Adams, with many bows and ac|knowledgements accepted, tho' he afterwards &s;aid, <Q>he a&s;cended the chariot rather that he might not offend, than from any de&s;ire of riding in it, for that in his heart he preferred the Pede&s;trian even to the Vehicular expedition.</Q> All matters <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;ettled, the chariot, in which rode Adams and Pounce, moved forwards; and Jo&s;eph having borrowed a pillion from the ho&s;t, Fanny had ju&s;t

&s;eated her&s;elf thereon, and had laid h&oacute;ld of the gir|dle which her lover wore for that purpo&s;e, when the wi&s;e bea&s;t, who concluded that one at a time was &s;ufficient, that two to one were odds, &amp;c. di&s;cover|ed much unea&s;ine&s;s at his double load, and began to con&s;ider his hinder as his forelegs, moving the di|rect contrary way to that which is called forwards. Nor could Jo&s;eph, with all his hor&s;eman&s;hip per|&s;uade him to advance; but without having any re|gard to the lovely part of the lovely girl which was on his back, he u&s;ed &s;uch agitations, that had not one of the men come immediately to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;he had, in plain Engli&s;h, tumbled backwards on the ground.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The arrival of lady Booby and the re&s;t at Booby-Hall.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE coach and &s;ix in which lady Booby rode, overtook the other travellers as they entered the pari&s;h. She no &s;ooner &s;aw Jo&s;eph, than her cheeks glowed with red, and immediately after be|came as totally pale. She had in her &s;urprize al|mo&s;t &s;topt her coach; but recollected her&s;elf timely enough to prevent it. She entered the pari&s;h a|mid&s;t the ringing of bells, and the acclamations of the poor, who were rejoiced to &s;ee their patrone&s;s returned after &s;o long an ab&s;ence, during which time all her rents had been drafted to London, without a &s;hilling been &s;pent among them, which tended not a little to their utter impoveri&s;hing; for if the court would be &s;everely mi&s;&s;ed in &s;uch a city as London, how much more mu&s;t the ab&s;ence of a per&s;on of great fortune be felt in a little country village, for

who&s;e inhabitants &s;uch a family finds a con&s;tant em|ployment and &s;upply; and with the offals of who&s;e table the infirm, aged, and infant poor, are abun|dantly fed, with a genero&s;ity which hath &s;carce a vi|&s;ible effect on their benefactor's pockets?</P>
<P>But if their intere&s;t in&s;pired &s;o public a joy into every countenance, how much more forcibly did the affection which they bore per&s;on Adams operate up|on all who beheld his return? they flocked about him like dutiful children and an indulgent parent, and vied with each other in demon&s;trations of duty and love. The per&s;on on his &s;ide &s;hook every one by the hand, enquired heartily after the healths of all that were ab&s;ent, of their children and relations, and expre&s;s'd a &s;atisfaction in his face, which no|thing but benevolence made happy by its objects could infu&s;e.</P>
<P>Nor did Jo&s;eph and Fanny want a hearty wel|come from all who &s;aw them. In &s;hort, no three per&s;ons could be more kindly received, as indeed, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> ever more de&s;erved to be univer&s;ally beloved.</P>
<P>Adams carried his fellow-travellers home to his hou&s;e where he in&s;i&s;ted on their partaking whatever his wife, whom with his children, he found in health and joy, could provide; where we &s;hall leave them enjoying perfect happine&s;s over a home|ly meal, to view &s;cenes of greater &s;plendor, but in|finitely le&s;s bli&s;s.</P>
<P>Our more intelligent readers will doubtle&s;s &s;u&s;|pect by this &s;econd appearance of lady Booby on the &s;tage, that all was not ended by the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of Jo|&s;eph; and, to be hone&s;t with them, they are in the right; the arrow had pierced deeper than &s;he ima|gined; nor was the wound &s;o ea&s;ily to be cured. The removal of the object &s;oon cooled her rage, but it had a different effect on her love; that departed

with his per&s;on; but this remained lurking in her mind with his image. Re&s;tle&s;s, interrupted &s;lum|bers, and confu&s;ed horrible dreams were her porti|on the fir&s;t night. In the morning, fancy painted her a more delicious; but to delude, not delight her; for before &s;he could reach the promi&s;ed hap|pine&s;s, it vani&s;hed, and left her to cur&s;e, not ble&s;s the vi&s;ion.</P>
<P>She &s;tarted from her &s;leep, her imagination be|ing all on fire with the phantom, when her eyes accidentally glancing towards the &s;pot where ye&s;|terday the real Jo&s;eph had &s;tood, that little circum|&s;tance rai&s;ed his idea in the livelie&s;t colours in her memory. Each look, each word, each ge&s;ture ru&s;hed back on her mind with charms which all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> coldne&s;s could not abate. Now &s;he imputed that to his youth, his folly, his awe, his religion, to every thing, but what would in&s;tantly have produced con|tempt, want of pa&s;&s;ion for the &s;ex: or, that which would have rou&s;ed her hatred, want of liking to her.</P>
<P>Reflection then hurried her farther, and told her, &s;he mu&s;t &s;ee this beautiful youth no more: nay, &s;ugge&s;ted to her, that &s;he her&s;elf had di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him for no other fault, than probably that of too violent an awe and re&s;pect for her&s;elf: and which &s;he ought rather to have e&s;teemed a merit, the effects of which were be&s;ides &s;o ea&s;ily and &s;urely to have been re|moved; &s;he then blamed, &s;he cur&s;ed the ha&s;ty ra&s;h|ne&s;s of her temper; her fury was vented all on her|&s;elf, and Jo&s;eph appeared innocent in her eyes. Her pa&s;&s;ion at length grew &s;o violent, that it forc|ed her on &s;eeking relief, and now &s;he thought of re|calling him; but pride forbad that; pride which &s;oon drove all &s;ofter pa&s;&s;ions from her &s;oul, and re|pre&s;ented to her the meanne&s;s of him &s;he was fond

of. That thought &s;oon began to ob&s;cure his beau|ties; contempt &s;ucceeded next, and then di&s;dain, which pre&s;ently introduced her hatred of the creature who had given her &s;o much unea&s;ine&s;s. The&s;e en|emies of Jo&s;eph had no &s;ooner taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her mind, than they in&s;inuated to her a thou&s;and things in his disfavour; every thing but di&s;like of her per&s;on; a thought, which, as it would have been intolerable to bear, &s;he checked the moment it endeavoured to ari&s;e. Revenge came now to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and &s;he con&s;idered her di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of him &s;tript, and without a character, with the utmo&s;t plea&s;ure. She rioted in the &s;everal kinds of mi&s;ery, which her imagination &s;ugge&s;ted to her might be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> fate; and with a &s;mile compo&s;ed of anger, mirth, and &s;corn, viewed him in the rags in which her fancy had dre&s;s'd him.</P>
<P>Mrs. Slip&s;lop being &s;ummoned, attended her mi&s;tre&s;s, who had now in her own opinion totally &s;ubdued this pa&s;&s;ion. Whil&s;t &s;he was dre&s;&s;ing, &s;he a&s;ked if that fellow had been turned away ac|cordingly to her orders. Slip&s;lop an&s;wered, &s;he had told her lady&s;hip &s;o, (as indeed &s;he had) &mdash;'And how did he behave?' replied the lady. 'Truly, Madam,' cries Slip&s;lop, in &s;uch a man|ner, as infected every body who &s;aw him. The poor lad had but little wages to receive: for he con&s;tantly allowed his father and mother half his income; &s;o that when your lady&s;hip's livery was &s;tript off, he had not wherewithal to buy a coat, and mu&s;t have gone naked, if one of the footmen had not incommodated him with one, and whil&s;t he was &s;tanding in his &s;hirt, (and to &s;ay the truth he was an amorous figure) being told your lady|&s;hip would not give him a character, he &s;ighed and &s;aid, he had done nothing willingly to offend;

that for his part he &s;hould always give your lady|&s;hip a good character wherever he went; and he prayed God to ble&s;s you: for you was the be&s;t of ladies, though his enemies had &s;et you again&s;t him; I wi&s;h you had not turned him away; for I believe you had not a faithfuller &s;ervant in the hou&s;e.&mdash;'How came you then,' replied the lady, 'to advi&s;e me to turn him away?'

found good rea&s;on to doubt whether &s;he had &s;o ab|&s;olutely conquered her pa&s;&s;ion, as &s;he had flattered her&s;elf; and, in order to accompli&s;h it quite, took a re&s;olution more common than wi&s;e, to retire im|mediately into the country.

<P>The morning after her arrival, being Sunday, &s;he went to church, to the great &s;urprize of every body, who wondered to &s;ee her lady&s;hip, being no very con&s;tant church woman, there &s;o &s;uddenly upon her journey. Jo&s;eph was likewi&s;e there; and I have heard it was remarked, that &s;he fixed her eyes on him much more than on the par&s;on; but this I believe to be only a malicious rumour. When the prayers were ended, Mr. Adams &s;tood up, and with a loud voice pronounced: I publi&s;h the banns of marriage between Jo&s;eph Andrews and Frances Goodwill, both of this pari&s;h, &amp;c. Whether this had any effect on lady Booby or no, who was then in her pew, which the congregation could not &s;ee into, I could never di&s;cover: but certain it is, that in about a quarter of an hour &s;he &s;tood up, and directed her eyes to that part of the church were the women &s;at, and per&s;i&s;ted in look|ing that way during the remainder of the &s;ermon, in &s;o &s;crutinizing a manner, and with &s;o angry a countenance, that mo&s;t of the women were afraid &s;he was offended at them.</P>
<P>The moment &s;he returned home, &s;he &s;ent for Slip&s;lop into her chamber, and told her, &s;he won|dered what that impudent fellow Jo&s;eph did in that pari&s;h. Upon which Slip&s;lop gave her an account of her meeting Adams with him on the

<P>A dialogue between Mr. Abraham Adams and the lady Booby.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MR. Adams was not far off; for he was drink|ing her lady&s;hip's health below in a cup of her ale. He no &s;ooner came before her, than &s;he began in the following manner: <Q>I wonder, Sir, after the many great obligations you have had to this family,</Q> (with all which the reader hath, in the cour&s;e of this hi&s;tory, been minutely acquaint|ed) <Q>that you will ungratefully &s;hew any re&s;pect to a fellow who hath been turned out of it for his mi&s;deeds. Nor doth it, I can tell you, Sir, be|come a man of your character, to run about the country with an idle fellow and wench: Indeed, as for the girl, I know no harm of her, Slip&s;lop tells me &s;he was formerly bred up in my hou&s;e, and behaved as &s;he ought, till &s;he hankered after this fellow, and he &s;poiled her. Nay, &s;he may &s;till, perhaps, do very well, if he will let her alone. You are therefore doing a mon&s;trous thing, in endeavouring to procure a match between the&s;e two people, which will be to the ruin <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> them both.</Q>&mdash;'Madam,' &s;ays Adams, <Q>if your lady&s;hip will but hear me &s;peak, I prote&s;t I never heard any harm of Mr. Jo&s;eph Andrews; if I had, I &s;hould have corrected him for it: for I never have, nor will encourage the faults of tho&s;e under
<PB N="124" REF="023370_0345_0FBF65C322AB2EE0">
my cure. As for the young woman, I a&s;&s;ure your lady&s;hip I have as good an opinion of her as your lady&s;hip your&s;elf, or any other can have. She is the &s;weete&s;t-tempered, hone&s;te&s;t, worthie&s;t, young creature; indeed, as to her beauty, I do not commend her on that account, though all men allow &s;he is the hand&s;ome&s;t woman, gentle, or &s;imple, that ever appeared in the pari&s;h.</Q> 'You are very impertinent,' &s;ays &s;he, <Q>to talk &s;uch ful&s;ome &s;tuff to me. It is mighty becoming tru|ly in a clergyman to trouble him&s;elf about hand|&s;ome women, and you are a delicate judge of beauty, no doubt. A man who hath lived all his life in &s;uch a pari&s;h as this, is a rare judge of beau|ty. Ridiculous! Beauty indeed,&mdash;a country wench a beauty.&mdash;I &s;hall be &s;ick whenever I hear beauty mentioned again&mdash;And &s;o this wench is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o &s;tock the pari&s;h with beauties, I hope.&mdash;But, Sir, our poor is numerous enough already; I will have no more vagabonds &s;ettled here.</Q> 'Madam,' &s;ays Adams, <Q>your lady&s;hip is offended with me, I prote&s;t, without any rea&s;on. This couple were de&s;irous to con&s;ummate long ago, and I di&s;&s;uaded them from it; nay, I may venture to &s;ay, I be|lieve I was the &s;ole cau&s;e of their delaying it.</Q> 'Well,' &s;ays &s;he, <Q>and you did very wi&s;ely and hone&s;tly too, notwith&s;tanding &s;he is the greate&s;t beauty in the pari&s;h,</Q>&mdash;'And now, Madam,' continued he, <Q>I only perform my office to Mr. Jo&s;eph.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Pray, don't mi&s;ter &s;uch.fellows to me,</Q> cries the lady.

But if they have put

in the banns, I de&s;ire you will publi&s;h them no more without my orders.</Q> 'Madam,' cries A|dams, <Q>if any one puts in &s;ufficient caution, and a&s;&s;igns a proper rea&s;on again&s;t them, I am willing to &s;urcea&s;e.</Q>&mdash;'I tell you a rea&s;on,' &s;ays &s;he, <Q>he is a vagabond, and he &s;hall not &s;ettle here, and bring a ne&s;t of beggars into the pari&s;h; it will make us but little amends that they will be beau|ties.</Q> 'Madam,' an&s;wered Adams, <Q>with the ut|mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to your lady&s;hip, I have been in|formed by lawyer Scout, that any per&s;on who &s;erves a year, gains a &s;ettlement in the pari&s;h where he &s;erves.</Q> 'Lawyer Scout,' replied the lady, <Q>is an impudent coxcomb; I will have no lawyer Scout interfere with me. I repeat to you again, I will have no more incumbrances brought on us: &s;o I de&s;ire you will proceed no farther.</Q> 'Madam,' returned Adams, I<Q> would obey your lady&s;hip in every thing that is lawful; but &s;urely the parties being poor is no rea&s;on again&s;t their marrying. God forbid there &s;hould be any &s;uch law. The poor have little &s;hare enough of this world already; it would be barbarous indeed to deny them the common privileges and innocent enjoyments which nature indulges to the animal creation.</Q><Q> Since you under&s;tand your&s;elf no better,</Q> cries the lady, <Q>nor the re&s;pect due from &s;uch as you to a woman of my di&s;tinction, than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o affront my ears by &s;uch loo&s;e di&s;cour&s;e, I &s;hall mention but one &s;hort word; it is my orders to you, that you publi&s;h the&s;e banns no more&punc; and if you dare, I will recommend it to your ma&s;ter the doctor, to di&s;card you from his &s;ervice.

The utmo&s;t that was in the power of a lawyer, was to prevent the law's taking effect; and that he him&s;elf could do for her lady&s;hip as well as any other: and I be|lieve, &s;ays he, Madam, your lady&s;hip not being conver&s;ant in the&s;e matters, hath mi&s;taken a dif|ference: for I a&s;&s;erted only, that a man who &s;erv|ed a year was &s;ettled. Now there is a material difference between being &s;ettled in law and &s;ettled in fact; and as I affirmed generally, he was &s;ett|led, and law is preferable to fact, my &s;ettlement mu&s;t be under&s;tood in law, and not in fact. And &s;uppo&s;e, madam, we admit he was &s;ettled in law, what u&s;e will they make of it? how doth that re|late to fact? He is not &s;ettled in fact; and if he be not &s;ettled in fact, he is not an inhabitant; and if he is not an inhabitant, he is not of this pari&s;h; and then undoubtedly he ought not to be publi&s;hed here; for Mr. Adams hath told me your lady|&s;hip's plea&s;ure, and the rea&s;on, which is a very good one, to prevent burdening us with the poor; we have too many already: and I think we ought to have an act to hang or tran&s;port half of them. If we can prove in evidence, that he is not &s;ettled in fact, it is another matter. What I &s;aid to Mr. Adams, was on a &s;uppo&s;ition that he was &s;ettled in fact; and indeed if that was the ca&s;e, I &s;hould doubt</Q>&mdash;'Don't tell me your facts and your ifs,' &s;aid the lady, <Q>I don't under&s;tand your gibberi&s;h: you take too much upon you, and are very imper|tinent in pretending to direct in this pari&s;h, and

you &s;hall be taught better, I a&s;&s;ure you, you &s;hall. But as to the wench, I am re&s;olved &s;he &s;hall not &s;ettle here; I will not &s;uffer &s;uch beauties as the&s;e to produce children for us to keep.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Beauties in|deed! your lady&s;hip is plea&s;ed to be merry,</Q>&mdash;an|&s;wered Scout.&mdash;<Q>Mr. Adams de&s;cribed her &s;o to me,</Q> &s;aid the lady.&mdash;<Q>Pray what &s;ort of a dowdy is it, Mr. Scout?</Q>&mdash;<Q>The uglie&s;t creature almo&s;t I ever beheld, a poor dirty drab, your lady&s;hip ne|ver &s;aw &s;uch a wretch.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Well, but dear Mr. Scout, let her be what &s;he will,&mdash;the&s;e ugly wo|men will bring children you know; &s;o that we mu&s;t prevent the marriage,</Q>&mdash;'True, Madam,' replied Scout, <Q>for the &s;ub&s;equent marriage, co-ope|rating with the law, will carry law into fact.&mdash;When a man is married, he is &s;ettled in fact; and then he is not removeable. I will &s;ee Mr. Adams, and I make no doubt of prevailing with him. His only objection is, doubtle&s;s, that he &s;hall lo&s;e his fee; but that being once made ea&s;y, as it &s;hall be, I am confident no farther objection will re|main. No, no, it is impo&s;&s;ible; but your lady|&s;hip can't di&s;commend his unwillingne&s;s to depart from his fee. Every man ought to have a proper value for his fee. As to the matter in que&s;tion, if your lady&s;hip plea&s;es to employ me in it, I will venture to promi&s;e you &s;ucce&s;s. The laws of this land are not &s;o vulgar, to permit a mean fellow to contend with one of your lady&s;hip's fortune. We have one &s;ure card, which is to carry him before ju&s;tice Frolic, who, upon hearing your lady&s;hip's name, will commit him without any farther que&s;|tions. As for the dirty &s;lut, we &s;hall have no|thing to do with her; for if we get rid of the fel|low, the ugly jade will</Q>&mdash;<Q>Take what mea&s;ures you plea&s;e, good Mr. Scout, </Q>an&s;wered the lady,

<Q>but I wi&s;h you could rid the pari&s;h of both; for Slip&s;lop tells me &s;uch &s;tories of this wench, that I abhor the thoughts of her; and though you &s;ay &s;he is &s;uch an ugly &s;lut, yet you know, dear Mr. Scout, the&s;e forward creatures who run after men, will always find &s;ome as forward as them&s;elves: &s;o that to prevent the increa&s;e of beggars, we mu&s;t get rid of her.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Your lady&s;hip is very much in the right,</Q> an&s;wered Scout, <Q>but I am afraid the law is a little deficient in giving us any &s;uch power of pre|vention; however, the ju&s;tice will &s;tretch it as far as he is able, to oblige your lady&s;hip. To &s;ay the truth, it is a great ble&s;&s;ing to the country that he is in the commi&s;&s;ion; for he hath taken &s;everal poor off our hands that the law would never lay hold on. I know &s;ome ju&s;tices who make as much of committing a man to Bridewell, as his lord&s;hip at &s;ize would of hanging him; but it would do a man good to &s;ee his wor&s;hip our ju&s;tice, commit a fellow to Bridewell: he takes &s;o much plea&s;ure in it: and when once we ha' um there; we &s;el|dom hear any more o'um.

<P>This Scout was one of tho&s;e fellows who; with|out any knowledge of the law, or being bred to it, take upon them, in defiance of an act of parlia|ment, to act as lawyers in the country, and are called &s;o. They are the pe&s;ts of &s;ociety, and a &s;candal to a profe&s;&s;ion to which indeed they do not belong; and which owes to &s;uch kind of ra&s;cal|lions the ill-will which weak per&s;ons bear towards it.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>ALL th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> night, and the next day, the lady Booby pa&s;&s;ed with the utmo&s;t anxiety; her mind was di&s;tracted, and her &s;oul to&s;&s;ed up and down by many turbulent and oppo&s;ite pa&s;&s;ions. She loved, hated, pitied, &s;corned; admired, de&s;pi&s;ed the &s;ame per&s;on by fits, which changed in a very &s;hort interval. On Tue&s;day morning, which hap|pened to be a holiday, &s;he went to church, where, to her &s;urprize, Mr. Adams publi&s;hed the banns again, with as audible a voice as before. It was lucky for her, that as there was no &s;ermon, &s;he had immediate opportunity of returning home to vent her rage, which &s;he could not have concealed from the congregation five minutes; indeed it wad not then very numerous, the a&s;&s;embly con&s;i&s;ting of no more than Adams, his clerk, his wife, the lady, and one of her &s;ervants. At her return &s;he met Slip&s;lop, who acco&s;ted her in the&s;e words.&mdash;<Q>O meam, what doth your lady&s;hip think? To be &s;ure lawyer Scout hath carried Jo&s;eph and Fan|ny

both before the ju&s;tice. All the pari&s;h are in tears, and &s;ay they will certainly be hanged: for no body knows what it is for.</Q>&mdash;<Q>I &s;uppo&s;e they de&s;erve it,</Q> &s;ays the lady. <Q>Why do&s;t thou men|tion &s;uch wretches to me?</Q> <Q>O dear Madam, an|&s;wered Slip&s;lop, is it not a pity &s;uch a gracele&s;s young man &s;hould die a virulent death? I hope the judge will take commen&s;uration on his youth. As for Fanny, I don't think it &s;ignifies much what becomes of her; and if poor Jo&s;eph hath done any thing, I could venture to &s;wear &s;he traduced him to it: Few men ever come to fra|grant puni&s;hment, but by tho&s;e na&s;ty creatures who are a &s;candal to our &s;ect.</Q> The lady was no more plea&s;ed at this news, after a moment's re|flection, than Slip&s;lop her&s;elf: for though &s;he wi&s;hed Fanny far enough, &s;he did not de&s;ire the removal of Jo&s;eph, e&s;pecially with her. She was puzzled how to act or what to &s;ay on this occa&s;ion, when a coach and &s;ix drove into the court, and a &s;ervant acquainted her with the arrival of her ne|phew Booby and his lady. She ordered them to be conducted into a drawing-room, whither &s;he pre&s;ently repaired, having compo&s;ed her counte|nance as well as &s;he could; and being a little &s;a|tisfied that the wedding would by the&s;e means be at lea&s;t interrupted, and that &s;he &s;hould have an op|portunity to execute any re&s;olution &s;he might take, for which &s;he &s;aw her&s;elf provided with an excellent in&s;trument in Scout.</P>
<P>The lady Booby apprehended her &s;ervant had made a mi&s;take, when he mentioned Mr. Booby's lady; for &s;he had never heard of his marriage; but how great was her &s;urpri&s;e, when at her entering the room, her nephew pre&s;ented his wife to her, &s;aying, 'Madam, this is that charming Pamela, of
<PB N="132" REF="023370_0353_0FBF65DE5BE0DB28">
'whom I am convinced you have heard &s;o much.' The lady received her with more civility than he ex|pected; indeed with the utmo&s;t; for &s;he was per|fectly polite, nor had any vice incon&s;i&s;tent with good-breeding. They pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome little time in ordinary di&s;cour&s;e, when a &s;ervant came and wi&s;|pered Mr. Booby, who pre&s;ently told the ladies he mu&s;t de&s;ert them a little on &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s of con|&s;equence; and as their di&s;cour&s;e during his ab&s;ence would afford little improvement or entertainment to the reader, we will leave them for a while to at|tend Mr. Booby.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE young &s;quire and his lady were no &s;ooner alighted from their coach, than the &s;ervants began to enquire after Mr. Jo&s;eph, from whom they &s;aid their lady had not heard a word, to her great &s;urpri&s;e, &s;ince he had left lady Booby's. Upon this they were in&s;tantly informed of what had lately happened, with which they ha&s;tily acquainted their ma&s;ter, who took an immediate re&s;olution to go him&s;elf and endeavor to re&s;tore his Pamela her bro|ther, before &s;he even knew &s;he had lo&s;t him.</P>
<P>The ju&s;tice before whom the criminals were car|ried, and who lived within a &s;hort mile of the lady's hou&s;e, was luckily Mr. Booby's acquaintance, by his having an e&s;tate in his neighbourhood. Order|ing therefore his hor&s;es to his coach, he &s;et out for me judgment-&s;eat, and arrived when the ju&s;tice had almo&s;t fini&s;hed his bu&s;ine&s;s. He was conducted in|to
<PB N="133" REF="023370_0354_0FBF65E09C19DCE8">
a hall, where he was acquainted that his wor&s;hip would wait on him in a moment; for he had only a man and a woman to commit to Bridewell fir&s;t. As he was now convinced he had not a minute to lo&s;e, he in&s;i&s;ted on the &s;ervant's introducing him di|rectly into the room where the ju&s;tice was then ex|ecuting his office, as he called it. Being brought thither, and the fir&s;t compliments being pa&s;&s;ed be|tween the &s;quire and his wor&s;hip, the former a&s;ked the latter, what crime tho&s;e two young people had been guilty of? 'No great crime,' an&s;wered the ju&s;tice. <Q>I have only ordered them to Bridewell for a month.</Q> 'But what is their crime?' repeat|ed the &s;quire. 'Larceny, an't plea&s;e your houour,' &s;ays Scout. 'Ay,' &s;ays the ju&s;tice, <Q>a kind of fe|lonious larcenous thing. I believe I mu&s;t order them a little correction too, a little &s;tripping and whipping.</Q> (Poor Fanny, who had hitherto &s;up|ported all with the thoughts of Jo&s;eph's company, trembled at that &s;ound; but indeed without rea&s;on, for none but the devil him&s;elf would have executed &s;uch a &s;entence on her.) 'Still,' &s;aid, the &s;quire, 'I am ignorant of the crime, the fact I mean' 'Why, there it is in paper,' an&s;wered the ju&s;tice, &s;hewing him a depo&s;ition, which in the ab&s;ence of his clerk, he had writ him&s;elf, of which we have with great difficulty procured an authentic copy: and here it follows <HI>verbatim &amp; literatim.</HI></P>

<PB N="135" REF="023370_0356_0FBF65E374C04D90">
how near he was related to him. The ju&s;tice burnt his mittimus; the con&s;table was &s;ent about his bu&s;ine&s;s: the lawyer made no complaint for want of ju&s;tice; and the pri&s;oners with exulting hearts gave a thou&s;and thanks to his honour Mr. Booby, who did not intend their obligations to him &s;hould cea&s;e here; for ordering his man to produce a cloak-bag which he had cau&s;ed to be brought from lady Booby's on purpo&s;e, he de&s;ired the ju&s;tice that he might have Jo&s;eph with him into a room; where ordering his &s;ervant to take out a &s;uit of his own clothes, with linen and other-nece&s;&s;aries, he l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">t Jo&s;eph to dre&s;s him&s;elf, who not yet knowing the cau&s;e of all this civility, excu&s;ed his accepting &s;uch a favour, as long as decently he could. Whil&s;t Jo|&s;eph was dre&s;&s;ing, the &s;quire repaired to the ju&s;|tice, whom he found talking with Fanny; for dur|ing the examination, &s;he had flapped her hat over her eyes, which were al&s;o bathed in tears, and had by that means concealed from his wor&s;hip what might perhaps have rendered the arrival of Mr. Booby unnece&s;&s;ary, at lea&s;t for her&s;elf. The ju&s;|tice no &s;ooner &s;aw her countenance cleared up, and her bright eyes &s;hining through her tears, than he &s;ecretly cur&s;ed him&s;elf for having once thought of Bridewell for her.

<P>The &s;quire now returned, and prevented any far|ther continuance of this conver&s;ation; and the ju&s;tice, out of a pretended re&s;pect to his gue&s;t, but in reality from an apprehen&s;ion of a rival, (for he knew nothing of his marriage) ordered Fanny into the kitchen, whither &s;he gladly retired; nor did the &s;quire, who declined the trouble of explaining the whole matter, oppo&s;e it.</P>
<P>It would be unnece&s;&s;ary, if I was able, which indeed I am not, to relate the conver&s;ation between the&s;e two gentlemen, which rolled as I have been informed, entirely on the &s;ubject of hor&s;e-racing. Jo&s;eph was &s;oon dre&s;s'd in the plaine&s;t dre&s;s he could find, which was a blue coat and breeches, with a glad edging, and a red wai&s;tcoat with the &s;ame; and as this &s;uit, which was rather too large for the &s;quire, exactly fitted him; &s;o he became it well, and looked &s;o genteel, that no per&s;on would have doubted its being as well adapted to his qua|lity as his &s;hape; nor have &s;u&s;pected, as one might, when my lord&mdash;, or Sir,&mdash;or Mr.&mdash;appear in lace or embroidery, that the taylor's man-wore tho&s;e clothes home on his back, which he &s;hould have carried under his arm.</P>
<P>The &s;quire now took leave of the ju&s;tice, and calling for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, made her and Jo&s;eph, again&s;t their wills, get <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the coach with him, which he

then ordered to drive to lady Booby's.&mdash;It had moved a few yards only, when the &s;quire a&s;ked Jo|&s;eph if he knew who that man was cro&s;&s;ing the field; for, added he, I never &s;aw one take &s;uch &s;trides before. Jo&s;eph an&s;wered eagerly, <Q>O Sir, it is par&s;on Adams.</Q>&mdash;<Q>O la, indeed, and &s;o it is, &s;aid Fanny; poor man, he is coming to do what he could for us. Well, he is the worthie&s;t be&s;t-natured creature,</Q>&mdash;'Ay,' &s;aid Jo&s;eph, <Q>God ble&s;s him; for there is not &s;uch another in the univer&s;e.</Q>&mdash;'The be&s;t creature living &s;ure,' cries Fanny. 'Is he?' &s;ays the &s;quire, <Q>then I am re|&s;olved to have the be&s;t creature living in my coach:</Q> and &s;o &s;aying he ordered it to &s;top, whil&s;t Jo&s;eph, at his reque&s;t, hallooed to the par&s;on, who well knowing his voice, made all the ha&s;te imagin|able, and &s;oon came up with them. He was de|&s;ired by the ma&s;ter, who could &s;carce refrain from laughter at his figure, to mount into the coach, which he with many thanks refu&s;ed, &s;aying he could walk by his &s;ide, and he'd warrant he kept up with it; but he was at length over-prevailed on. The &s;quire now acquainted Jo&s;eph with his mar|riage; but he might have-&s;pared him&s;elf that la|bour; for his &s;ervant, whil&s;t Jo&s;eph was dre&s;&s;ing, had performed that office before. He continued to expre&s;s the va&s;t happine&s;s he enjoyed in his &s;i&s;ter, and the value he had for all who belonged to her. Jo&s;eph made many bows, and expre&s;&s;ed an many acknowledgments; and par&s;on Adams who now fir&s;t perceived Jo&s;eph's new apparel, bur&s;t into tears with joy, and fell to rubbing his hands and &s;napping his fingers, as if he had been mad.</P>
<P>They were now arrived at the lady Booby's, and the &s;quire de&s;iring them to wait a moment in the court, walked in to his aunt, and calling her out
<PB N="138" REF="023370_0359_0FBF65F27068AF58">
from his wife, acquainted her with Jo&s;eph's arri|val; &s;aying, <Q>Madam, as I have married a virtu|ous and worthy woman, I am re&s;olved to own her relations, and &s;hew them all a proper re&s;pect; I &s;hall think my&s;elf, therefore, infinitely obliged to all mine, who will do the &s;ame. It is true, her brother hath been your &s;ervant, but he is now become my brother; and I have one happine&s;s, that neither his character, his behaviour, or ap|pearance, give me any rea&s;on to be a&s;hamed of calling him &s;o.

<P>This was a &s;troke of fortune beyond the lady Booby's hopes or expectation; &s;he an&s;wered him eagerly, <Q>Nephew, you know how ea&s;ily I am pre|vailed on to do any thing which Jo&s;eph Andrews de&s;ires&mdash;Phoo, I mean which you de&s;ire me, and as he is now your relation, I cannot refu&s;e to en|tertain him as &s;uch.</Q> The &s;quire told her, he knew his obligation to her for her compliance; and going three &s;teps, returned and told her&mdash;he had one more favour, which he believed &s;he would ea&s;ily grant, as &s;he had accorded him the former.

<P>THE meeting between Jo&s;eph and Pamela was not without tears of joy on both &s;ides; and their embraces were full of tenderne&s;s and affecti|on. They were however regarded with much

more plea&s;ure by the nephew than by the aunt, to who&s;e flame they were fuel only; and being a&s;&s;i&s;t|ed by the addition of dre&s;s, which was indeed not wanted to &s;et off the lively colours in which nature had drawn health, &s;trength, comeline&s;s and youth. In the afternoon Jo&s;eph, at their reque&s;t, entertain|ed them with an account of his adventures; nor could lady Booby conceal her di&s;&s;atisfaction at tho&s;e parts in which Fanny was concerned, e&s;pe|cially when Mr. Booby launched forth into &s;uch rapturous prai&s;es of her beauty. She &s;aid, apply|ing to her niece, that &s;he wondered her nephew, who had pretended to marry for love, &s;hould think &s;uch a &s;ubject proper to amu&s;e his wife with; ad|ding, that for her part, &s;he &s;hould be jealous of a hu&s;band, who &s;poke &s;o warmly in prai&s;e of another woman, Pamela an&s;wered, indeed &s;he thought &s;he had cau&s;e; but it was an in&s;tance of Mr. Booby's aptne&s;s to &s;ee more beauty in women than they were mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of. At which words both the wo|men fixed their eyes on two looking-gla&s;&s;es; and lady Booby replied, that men were in general, ve|ry ill judges of beauty; and then, whil&s;t both con|templated only their own faces, they paid a cro&s;s compliment to each other's charms. When the hour of re&s;t approached, which the lady of the hou&s;e deferred as long as decently &s;he could, &s;he informed Jo&s;eph (whom for the future we &s;hall call Mr. Jo&s;eph, he having as good a title to that appellation as many others, I mean that inconte&s;ted one of good clothes) that &s;he ordered a bed to be provid|ed for him. He declined this favour to his ut|mo&s;t; for his heart had long been with his Fanny; but &s;he in&s;i&s;ted on his accepting it, alledging, that the pari&s;h had no proper accommodation for &s;uch a per&s;on as he was now to e&s;teem him&s;elf.

The &s;tory of the mi&s;er, who, from long accu&s;toming to cheat others came at la&s;t to cheat him&s;elf, and with great delight and triumph

picked his own pocket of a guinea to convey to his hoard, is not impo&s;&s;ible or improbable. In like manner it fares with the practicers of deceit, who from having long deceived their acquaintance, gain at la&s;t a power of deceiving them&s;elves, and ac|quire that very opinion (however fal&s;e) of their own abilities, excellencies, and virtues, into which they have for years perhaps endeavoured to betray their neighbours. Now, reader, to apply this ob|&s;ervation to my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, thou mu&s;t know, that as the pa&s;&s;ion generally called love, exerci&s;es mo&s;t of the talents of the female or fair world; &s;o in this they now and then di&s;cover a &s;mall inclina|tion to deceit; for which thou wilt not be angry with the beautiful creatures, when thou ha&s;t con|&s;idered, that at the age of &s;even, or &s;omething earli|er, Mi&s;s is in&s;tructed by her mother that ma&s;ter is a very mon&s;trous kind of animal, who will, if &s;he &s;uffers him to come too near her, infallibly eat her up, and grind her to pieces. That &s;o far from ki&s;&s;ing or toying with him of her own accord, &s;he mu&s;t not admit him to ki&s;s or toy with her. And la&s;tly, that &s;he mu&s;t never have any affection to|wards him; for if &s;he &s;hould, all her friends in petticoats would e&s;teem her a traitre&s;s, point at her, and hunt her out of their &s;ociety. The&s;e impre&s;|&s;ions being fir&s;t received, are farther and deeper in|culcated by their &s;chool-mi&s;tre&s;&s;es and companions; &s;o that by the age of ten they have contracted &s;uch a dread and abhorrence of the above-named mon|&s;ter, that, whenever they &s;ee him, they fly from him as the innocent hare doth from the greyhound. Hence, to the age of fourteen or fifteen, they enter|tain a mighty antipathy to ma&s;ter; they re&s;olve, and frequently profe&s;s, that they will never have any commerce with him, and entertain fond hope<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">

of pa&s;&s;ing their lives out of his reach, of the po&s;&s;i|bility of which they have &s;o vi&s;ible an example in their good maiden aunt. But when they arrive at this period, and have now pa&s;s'd their &s;econd cli|macteric, when their wi&s;dom, grown riper, begins to &s;ee a little farther, and from almo&s;t daily falling in ma&s;ter's way, to apprehend the great difficulty of keeping out of it; and when they ob&s;erve him look often at them, and &s;ometimes very eagerly, and earne&s;tly too, (for the mon&s;ter &s;eldom takes any notice of them till at this age) they then begin to think of their danger; and as they perceive they cannot ea&s;ily avoid him, the wi&s;er part bethink them&s;elves of providing by other means for their &s;ecurity. They endeavour by all the methods they can invent to render them&s;elves &s;o amiable in his eyes, that he may have no inclination to hurt them; in which they generally &s;ucceed &s;o well, that his eyes by frequent langui&s;hing, &s;oon le&s;&s;en their idea of his fiercene&s;s, and &s;o far abate their fears, that they venture to parly with him; and when they perceive him &s;o different from what he hath been de&s;cribed, all gentlene&s;s, &s;oftne&s;s, kind|ne&s;s, tenderne&s;s, fondne&s;s, their dreadful apprehen|&s;ions vani&s;h in a moment; and now, (it being u&s;u|al with the human mind to &s;kip from one extreme to its oppo&s;ite, as ea&s;ily, and almo&s;t as &s;uddenly, as a bird from one bough to another;) love in&s;tantly &s;ucceeds to fear: But as it happens to per&s;ons who have in their infancy been thoroughly frightened with certain no-per&s;ons called gho&s;ts, that they re|tain their dread of tho&s;e beings; after they are convinced that there are no &s;uch things; &s;o the&s;e young ladies, tho' they no longer apprehend de|vouring, cannot &s;o entirely &s;hake off all that hath been in&s;tilled into them; they &s;till entertain the

idea of that cen&s;ure which was &s;o &s;trongly im|printed on their tender minds, to which the decla|rations of abhorrence they every day hear from their companions greatly contribute. To avoid this cen&s;ure therefore, is now their only care; for which purpo&s;e they &s;till pretend the &s;ame aver&s;ion to the mon&s;ter: And the more they love him, the more ardently they counterfeit the antipathy. By the continual and con&s;tant practice of which deceit no others, they at length impo&s;e on them&s;elves, and really believe they hate what they love. Thus indeed it happened to lady Booby, who loved Jo|&s;eph long before &s;he knew it; and now loved him much more than &s;he &s;u&s;pected. She had indeed, from the time of his &s;i&s;ter's arrival in the quality of her niece, and from the in&s;tant &s;he viewed him in the dre&s;s and character of a gentleman, began to conceive &s;ecretly a de&s;ign which love had concealed from her&s;elf, till a dream betrayed it to her.</P>
<P>She had no &s;ooner ri&s;en than &s;he &s;ent for her nephew; when he came to her, after many com|pliments on his choice, &s;he told him, <Q>He might perceive in her conde&s;cen&s;ion to admit her own &s;ervant to her table, that &s;he looked on the family of Andrews as his relations, and indeed hers; that as he had married into &s;uch a family, it be|came him to endeavour by all methods to rai&s;e it as much as po&s;&s;ible!

quickly gain him an alliance, which would not be to their di&s;credit.</Q></P>
<P>Her nephew heartily embraced this propo&s;al; and finding Mr. Jo&s;eph with his wife, at his return to her chamber, he immediately began thus: <Q>My love to my dear Pamela, brother, will extend to all her relations; nor &s;hall I &s;hew them le&s;s re|&s;pect than if I had married into the family of a duke. I hope I have given you &s;ome early te&s;ti|monies of this, and &s;hall continue to give you dai|ly more. You will excu&s;e me therefore, brother, if my concern for your intere&s;t makes me menti|on what may be, perhaps, di&s;agreeable to you to hear; But I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t upon it, that if you have any value for my alliance or my friend&s;hip, you will decline any thoughts of engaging farther with a girl who is, as you are a relation of mine, &s;o much beneath you. I know there may be at fir&s;t &s;ome difficulty in your compliance, but that will daily dimini&s;h; and you will in the end &s;incerely thank me for my advice. I own, indeed, the girl is hand&s;ome; but beauty alone is a poor in|gredient, and will make but an uncomfortable marriage.</Q> 'Sir,' &s;aid Jo&s;eph, <Q>I a&s;&s;ure you her beauty is not the lea&s;t perfection; nor do I know a virtue which that young creature is not po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of.</Q> 'As to her virtues,' an&s;wered Mr. Booby, <Q>you can be yet but a &s;lender judge of them: But if &s;he had ever &s;o many, you will find her equal in the&s;e among her &s;uperiors in both and fortune, which now you are to e&s;teem on a footing with your&s;elf; at lea&s;t I will take care they &s;hall &s;hort|ly be &s;o, unle&s;s you prevent me by degrading your&s;elf with &s;uch a match, a match I have hard|ly patience to think of; and which would break the hearts of your parents, who now rejoice in

the expectation of &s;eeing you make a figure in the world.</Q> 'I know not,' replied Jo&s;eph, <Q>that my parents have any power over my inclinations; nor am obliged to &s;acrifice my happine&s;s to their whim or ambition: Be&s;ides, I &s;hall be very &s;orry to &s;ee, that the unexpected advancement of my &s;i&s;ter &s;hould &s;o &s;uddenly in&s;pire them with this wicked pride, and make them de&s;pi&s;e their equals.

And be&s;ides, Sir, as you civilly throw my marri|age with your &s;i&s;ter in my teeth, I mu&s;t teach you the wide difference between us; my fortune ena|bled me to plea&s;e my&s;elf; and it would have been as overgrown a folly in me to have omitted it, as in you to do it.</Q><Q> My fortune enables me to plea&s;e my&s;elf likewi&s;e,</Q> &s;aid Jo&s;eph; <Q>for all my plea&s;ure is centred in Fanny; and whil&s;t I have health, I &s;hall be able to &s;upport her with my labour in that &s;tation to which &s;he was born, and with which &s;he is content,</Q> 'Brother,' &s;aid Pamela, <Q>Mr. Booby advi&s;es you as a friend; and, no doubt, my papa and mamma will be of his opi|nion, and will have great rea&s;on to be angry with you for de&s;troying what his goodne&s;s hath done, and throwing down our family again, after he hath rai&s;ed it. It would become you better, brother, to pray for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of grace again&s;t &s;uch a pa&s;&s;ion than to indulge it.&mdash;Sure, &s;i&s;ter, you are not in earne&s;t; I am &s;ure &s;he is your equal at lea&s;t.</Q>&mdash;'She was my equal,' an&s;wer|ed

Pamela, <Q>but I am no longer Pamela An|drews, I am now this gentleman's lady, and as &s;uch am above her&mdash;I hope I &s;hall never behave with an unbecoming pride, but at the &s;ame time, I &s;hall always endeavour to know my&s;elf, and que&s;tion not the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of grace to that purpo&s;e.</Q> They were now &s;ummoned to breakfa&s;t, and thus ended their di&s;cour&s;e for the pre&s;ent, very little to the &s;atisfaction of any of the parties.</P>
<P>Fanny was now walking in an avenue at &s;ome di&s;tance from the hou&s;e, where Jo&s;eph had promi&s;|ed to take the fir&s;t opportunity of coming to her. She had not a &s;hilling in the world, and had &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ed ever &s;ince her return, entirely on the charity of par&s;on Adams. A young gentleman, attended by many &s;ervants, came up to her, and a&s;ked her if that was not the lady Booby's hou&s;e before him? This indeed he well knew, but had framed the que&s;tion for no other rea&s;on than to make her look up, and di&s;cover if her face was equal to the delicacy of her &s;hape. He no &s;ooner &s;aw it than he was &s;truck with amazement. He &s;topt his hor&s;e, and &s;wore &s;he was the mo&s;t beautiful creature he ever beheld. Then in&s;tantly alighting, and delivering his hor&s;e to his &s;ervant, he rapt out half a dozen oathes that he would ki&s;s her; to which &s;he at fir&s;t &s;ubmitted, begging he would not be rude; but he was not &s;atisfied with the civility of a &s;alute; nor even with the rude&s;t at|tack he could make on her lips, but caught her in his arms, and endeavoured to ki&s;s her brea&s;ts, which with all her &s;trength &s;he re&s;i&s;ted, and, as our &s;park was not of the Herculean race, with &s;ome difficul|ty prevented. The young gentleman, being &s;oon out of breath in the &s;truggle, quitted her, and re|mounting his hor&s;e called one of his &s;ervants to him, whom he ordered to &s;tay behind with her,
<PB N="153" REF="023370_0374_0FBF66202F19EC20">
and make her any offers whatever, to prevail on her to return home with him in the evening; and to a&s;&s;ure her he would take her into keeping. He then rode on with his other &s;ervants, and arrived at the lady's hou&s;e, to whom he was a di&s;tant, relation, and was come to pay a vi&s;it.</P>
<P>The tru&s;ty fellow, who was employed in an of|fice he had been long accu&s;tomed to, di&s;charged his part with all the fidelity and dexterity imaginable; but to no purpo&s;e. She was entirely deaf to his offers, and rejected them with the utmo&s;t di&s;dain. At la&s;t the pimp, who had perhaps more warm blood about him than his ma&s;ter, began to &s;ollicit for him&s;elf; he told her, tho' he was a &s;ervant, he was a man of &s;ome fortune, which he would make her mi&s;tre&s;s of&mdash;and this without any in&s;ult to her virtue, for that he would marry her. She an&s;wered, if his ma&s;ter him&s;elf, or the greate&s;t lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> in the land, would marry her, &s;he would refu&s;e him. At la&s;t being weary with per&s;ua&s;ions, and on fire with charms which would have almo&s;t kin|dled a flame in the bo&s;om of an ancient philo&s;o|pher, or modern divine, he fa&s;tened his hor&s;e to the ground, and attacked her with much more force than the gentleman had exerted. Poor Fanny, would not have been able to re&s;i&s;t his rudene&s;s a long time; but the deity, who pre&s;ides over cha&s;te love, &s;ent her Jo&s;eph to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance. He no &s;oon|er came within &s;ight, and perceiving her &s;truggling with a man, than like a cannon-ball, or like light|ning, or any thing that is &s;wifter, if any thing be, he ran towards her, and coming up ju&s;t as the ra|vi&s;her had torn her handkerchief from her brea&s;t, before his lips had touched that &s;eat of innocence and bli&s;s, he dealt him &s;o lu&s;ty a blow in that part of his neck which a rope would have become with
<PB N="154" REF="023370_0375_0FBF66230E63F1D8">
the utmo&s;t propriety, that the fellow &s;taggered back|wards, and perceiving he had to do with &s;omething rougher than the little, tender, trembling hand of Fanny, he quitted her, and turning about &s;aw his rival, with fire fla&s;hing from his eyes, again ready to a&s;&s;ail him; and indeed before he could well de|fend him&s;elf, or return the fir&s;t blow, received a &s;econd, which, had it fallen on that part of the &s;to|mach to which it was directed, would have been probably the la&s;t he would have had any occa&s;ion for; but the ravi&s;her lifting up his hand, drove the blows upwards to his mouth, whence it di&s;lodged three of his teeth; and now not conceiving any ex|traordinary affection for the beauty of Jo&s;eph's per|&s;on, nor being extremely plea&s;ed with this method of &s;alutation, he collected all his force, and aimed a blow at Jo&s;eph's brea&s;t, which he artfully parry'd with one fi&s;t, &s;o that it lo&s;t its force entirely in air; and &s;topping one foot backward, he darted his fi&s;t &s;o fiercely at his enemy, that had he not caught it in his hand (for he was a boxer of no inferior fame) it mu&s;t have tumbled him on the ground. And now the ravi&s;her meditated another blow, which he aimed at that part of the brea&s;t where the heart is lodged; Jo&s;eph did not catch it as before, yet &s;o pre|vented its aim, that it fell directly on his no&s;e, but with abated force. Jo&s;eph then moving both fi&s;t and foot forwards at the &s;ame time, threw his head &s;o dexterou&s;ly into the &s;tomach of the ravi&s;her, that he fell a lifele&s;s lump on the field, where he lay ma|ny minutes breathle&s;s and motionle&s;s.</P>
<P>When Fanny &s;aw her Jo&s;eph receive a blow in his face, and blood running in a &s;tream from him, &s;he began to tear her hair, and invoke all human and divine power to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. She was not, however, long under this affliction, before Jo&s;eph
<PB N="155" REF="023370_0376_0FBF6623E4CEA350">
having conquered his enemy, ran to her, and a&s;&s;ur|ed her he was not hurt; &s;he then in&s;tantly fell on her knees, and thanked God that he had made Jo|&s;eph the means of her re&s;cue and at the &s;ame time pre&s;erved him from being injured in attempting it. She offered with her handkerchief to wipe his blood from his face; but he &s;eeing his rival attempting to recover his legs, turned to him, and a&s;ked him if he had enough; to which the other an&s;wered he had; for he believed he had fought with the devil, in&s;tead of a man; and loo&s;ening his hor&s;e, &s;aid he &s;hould not have attempted the wench if he had known &s;he had been &s;o well provided for.</P>
<P>Fanny now begged Jo&s;eph to return with her to par&s;on Adams, and to promi&s;e that he would leave her no more; the&s;e were propo&s;itions &s;o agreeable to Jo&s;eph, that, had he heard them, he would have given an immediate a&s;&s;ent: but indeed his eyes were now his only &s;en&s;e; for you may remember, reader, that the ravi&s;her had tore her handkerchief from Fanny's neck, by which he had di&s;covered &s;uch a &s;ight, that Jo&s;eph hath declared all the &s;tatues he ever beheld, were &s;o much inferior to it in beau|ty, that it was more capable of converting a man into a &s;tatue, than of being immitated by the great|e&s;t ma&s;ter of that art. This mode&s;t creature, whom no warmth in &s;ummer could ever induce to expo&s;e her charms to the wanton &s;un, a mode&s;ty to which perhaps they owed their inconceivable whitene&s;s, had &s;tood many minutes bare-necked in the pre&s;ence of Jo&s;eph, before her apprehen&s;ion of his danger, and the horror of &s;eeing his blood, would &s;uffer her once to reflect on what concerned her|self; till at la&s;t, when the cau&s;e of her concern had vani&s;hed, and admiration at his &s;ilence, together with ob&s;erving the fixed po&s;ition of his eyes, pro|duced
<PB N="156" REF="023370_0377_0FBF662DCF519D98">
an idea in the lovely maid, which brought more blood into her face than had flowed from Jo|&s;eph's no&s;trils. The &s;nowy hue of her bo&s;om was likewi&s;e exchanged to vermillion at the in&s;tant when &s;he clapped her handkerchief round her neck. Jo&s;eph &s;aw the unea&s;ine&s;s that &s;he &s;uffered, and im|mediately removed his eyes from an object, in &s;ur|veying which he had felt the greate&s;t delight which the organs of &s;ight were capable of conveying to his &s;oul. So great was his fear of offending her, and &s;o truly did his pa&s;&s;ion for her de&s;erve the noble name of love.</P>
<P>Fanny, being recovered from her confu&s;ion, which was almo&s;t equalled by what Jo&s;eph had felt from ob&s;erving it, again mentioned her reque&s;t; this was in&s;tantly and gladly complied with, and together they cro&s;&s;ed two or three fields, which brought them to the habitation of Mr. Adams.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>A di&s;cour&s;e which happened between Mr. Adams Mrs. Adams, Jo&s;eph, and Fanny, with &s;ome be|haviour of Mr. Adams, which would be called by &s;ome few readers very low, ab&s;urd, and unnatu|ral.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE par&s;on and his wife had ju&s;t ended a long di&s;pute when the lovers came to the door. Indeed this young couple had been the &s;ubject of di&s;pute; for Mrs. Adams was one of tho&s;e prudent people, who never do any thing to injure their fa|milies, or perhaps one of tho&s;e good mothers who would even &s;tretch their con&s;cience to &s;erve their children. She had long entertained hopes of &s;ee|ing her elde&s;t daughter &s;ucceed Mrs. Slip&s;lop, and
<PB N="157" REF="023370_0378_0FBF662FEDF87E60">
of making her &s;econd &s;on an exci&s;eman by lady Booby's intere&s;t. The&s;e were expectations &s;he could not endure the thoughts of quitting, and was therefore very unea&s;y to &s;ee her hu&s;band &s;o re&s;olute to oppo&s;e the lady's intention in Fanny's affair. She told him, <Q>it behoved every man to take the fir&s;t care of his family; that he had a wife and &s;ix children, the maintaining and providing for whom would be bu&s;ine&s;s enough for him with|out intermeddling in other folks affairs; that he had always preached up &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to &s;uperiors, and would do ill to give an example of the con|trary behaviour in his own conduct; that if lady Booby did wrong, &s;he mu&s;t an&s;wer for it her&s;elf, and the &s;in would not lie at their door; than Fanny had been a &s;ervant, and bred up in the lady's own family, and con&s;equently &s;he mu&s;t have known more of her than they did; and it was very im|probable, if &s;he had behaved her&s;elf well, that the lady would have been &s;o bitterly her enemy; that perhaps he was too much inclined to think well of her, becau&s;e &s;he was hand&s;ome, but hand&s;ome women were often no better than they &s;hould be; that G&mdash;made ugly women as well as hand&s;ome ones; and that if a women had virtue, it &s;ignified nothing whether &s;he had beauty or no!</Q> For all which rea&s;ons, &s;he concluded he &s;hould oblige the lady, and &s;top the future publication of the banns. But all the&s;e excellent arguments had no effect on the par&s;on, who per&s;i&s;ted in doing his duty; with|out regarding the con&s;equence it might have on his worldly intere&s;t; he endeavoured to an&s;wer her as well as he could, to which &s;he had ju&s;t fini&s;hed her reply, (for &s;he had always the la&s;t word every where but at church) when Jo&s;eph and Fanny en|tered their kitchen, where the par&s;on and his wife

then &s;at at breakfa&s;t over &s;ome bacon and cabbage. There was a coldne&s;s in the civility of Mrs. A|dams, which per&s;ons of accurate &s;peculation might have ob&s;erved, but e&s;caped her pre&s;ent gue&s;ts; indeed it was a good deal covered by the heartine&s;s of Adams, who no &s;ooner heard that Fanny had neither eat nor drank that morning, than he pre&s;ented her a bone of bacon he had ju&s;t been gnawing, being the only remains of his provi&s;ion, and then ran nimbly to the tap, and produced a mug of &s;mall beer, which he called ale; however, it was the be&s;t in his hou&s;e. Jo&s;eph addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the par&s;on, told him the di&s;cour&s;e which had pa&s;s'd between &s;quire Booby, his &s;i&s;ter, and him&s;elf, concerning Fanny: he then acquainted him with the dangers whence he had re&s;cued her, and communicated &s;ome apprehen&s;ions on her account. He conclud|ed, that he &s;hould never have an ea&s;y moment till Fanny was ab&s;olutely his, and begged that he might be &s;uffered to fetch a licence, &s;aying, he could ea&s;ily borrow the money. The par&s;on an&s;wered, that he had already given his &s;entiments concerning a licence, and that a very few days would make it un|nece&s;&s;ary. 'Jo&s;eph,' &s;ays he, <Q>I wi&s;h this ha&s;te doth not ari&s;e rather from your impatience than your fear; but as it certainly &s;prings from one of the&s;e cau&s;es, I will examine both. Of each of the&s;e therefore in their turn; and fir&s;t, for the fir&s;t of the&s;e, namely, impatience. Now, child, I mu&s;t inform you, that if in your purpo&s;ed mar|riage with this young woman, you have no inten|tion but the indulgence of carnal appetites, you are guilty of a very heinous &s;in. Marriage was ordained for nobler purpo&s;es, as you will learn when you hear the &s;ervice provided on that occa|&s;ion read to you. Nay, perhaps, if you are a

good lad, I &s;hall give you a &s;ermon <HI>gratis,</HI> where|in I &s;hall demon&s;trate how little regard ought to be had to the fle&s;h on &s;uch occa&s;ions. The text will be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, Matthew the 5th, and part of the 28th ver&s;e, <HI>Whoever looketh on a woman &s;o as to lu&s;t after her.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> latter part I &s;hall omit, as fo|reign to my purpo&s;e. Indeed all &s;uch brutal lu&s;ts and affections are to be greatly &s;ubdued, if not totally eradicated, before the ve&s;&s;el can be &s;aid to be con&s;ecrated to honour. To marry with a view of gratifying tho&s;e inclinations is a pro&s;titution of that holy ceremony, and mu&s;t entail a cur&s;e on all who &s;o lightly undertake it. If, therefore this ha&s;te ari&s;es from impatience, you are to cor|rect, and not give away to it. Now, as to the &s;e|cond head which I propo&s;ed to &s;peak to, namely, fear: it argues a diffidence highly criminal of that Power in which alone we &s;hould put our tru&s;t, &s;eeing we may be well a&s;&s;ured that he is able not only to defeat the de&s;igns of our enemies, but even to turn their hearts. In&s;tead of taking therefore any unju&s;tifiable or de&s;perate means to rid our&s;elves of fear, we &s;hould re&s;ort to prayer only on the&s;e occa&s;ions; and we may be then cer|tain of obtaining what is be&s;t for us. When any accident threatens us, we are not to de&s;pair, nor, when it overtakes us, to grieve; we mu&s;t &s;ubmit in all things to the will of Providence, and &s;et our affections &s;o much on nothing here, that we cannot quit it without reluctance. You are a young man, and can know but little of this world; I am older, and have &s;een a great deal. All pa&s;&s;ions are criminal in their exce&s;s; and even love it&s;elf, if it is not &s;ub&s;ervient to our du|ty, may render us blind to it. Had Abraham &s;o loved his &s;on I&s;aac as to refu&s;e the &s;acrifice re|quired,

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A vi&s;it which the good lady Booby and her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> friend paid to the par&s;on.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE lady Booby had no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> had an account from the gentleman of his meeting a wonder|ful beauty near her hou&s;e, and perceived the rap|tures with which he &s;poke of her, than immediate|ly concluding it mu&s;t be Fanny, &s;he began to medi|tate a de&s;ign of bringing them better acquainted: and to entertain hopes that the fine clothes, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">; and promi&s;es of this youth, would prevail on her to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> Jo&s;eph; &s;he therefore propo&s;ed to her company a walk in the fields before dinner, when &s;he led them towards Mr. Adams's hou&s;e; and, as &s;he approached it, told them, if they plea&s;ed &s;he would divert them with one of the mo&s;t ridicu|lous &s;ights they had ever &s;oon, which was an old fooli&s;h par&s;on, who, &s;he &s;aid laughing, kept a wife and &s;ix brats on a &s;alary of about twenty pounds a year; adding, that there was not &s;uch another rag|ged family in the pari&s;h. They all readily agreed to this vi&s;it, and arrived whil&s;t Mrs. Adams was declaiming as in the la&s;t chapter. Beau Didapper, which was the name of the young gentleman we have &s;een riding towards lady Booby's, with his cane mimic had the rap of a London footman at the door. The people within, namely, Adams, his wife, and three children, Jo&s;eph, Fanny, and the pedlar, were all thrown into confu&s;ion by this knock; but A|dams went directly to the door, which being open|ed, the lady Booby and her company walked in, and were received by the par&s;on with about two hun|dred bows, and by his wife with as many curt&s;ies;
<PB N="165" REF="023370_0386_0FBF6645B290FDF8">
the latter telling the lady. <Q>She was a&s;hamed to be &s;een in &s;uch a pickle, and that her hou&s;e was in &s;uch a litter: but that if &s;he expected &s;uch an ho|nour from her lady&s;hip, &s;he &s;hould have found her in a better manner.</Q> The par&s;on made no apo|logies, though he was in his half ca&s;&s;ock, and a flannel night-cap. He &s;aid, <Q>they were heartily welcome to his poor cottage,</Q> and, turning to Mr. Didapper, cried out, <HI>Non mea renidet in domo lacu|nar.</HI> The beau an&s;wered, <Q>He did not under&s;tand Welch;</Q> at which the par&s;on &s;tared, and made no reply.</P>
<P>Mr. Didapper, or beau Didapper, was a young gentleman of about four foot five inches in height. He wore his own hair: though the &s;carcity of it might have given him &s;ufficient excu&s;e for a peri|wig. His face was thin and pale: the &s;hape of his body and legs none of the be&s;t; for he had very narrow &s;houlders, and no calf; and his gait might more probably be called hopping than walking. The qualifications of his mind were well adapted to his per&s;on. We &s;hall handle them fir&s;t negatively. He was not entirely ignorant; for he could talk a little French, and &s;ing two or three Italian &s;ongs: he had lived too much in the world to be ba&s;hful, and too much at court to be proud: he &s;eemed not much inclined to avarice; for he was profu&s;e in his expences: nor had he all the features of prodigali|ty; for he never gave a &s;hilling:&mdash;no hater of wo|men; for he always dangled after them: yet &s;o lit|tle &s;ubject to lu&s;t, that he had, among tho&s;e who knew him be&s;t, the character of great moderation in his plea&s;ures. No drinker of wine; nor &s;o ad|dicted to pa&s;&s;ion, but that a hot word or two from an adver&s;ary made him immediately cool.</P>
<P>Now, to give him only a da&s;h or two on the af|formative
<PB N="166" REF="023370_0387_0FBF664728090DD0">
&s;ide, <Q>tho' he was born to an immen&s;e fortune, he cho&s;e, for the pitiful and dirty con&s;i|deration of a place of little con&s;equence, to depend entirely on the will of a fellow, whom they call a great man; who treated him with the utmo&s;t di&s;|re&s;pect, and exacted of him a plenary obedience to his commands; which he implicitly &s;ubmit|ted to, at the expence of his con&s;cience, his ho|nour, and of his country, in which he had him&s;elf &s;o very large a &s;hare. And to fini&s;h his charac|ter; as he was entirely well &s;atisfied with his own per&s;on and parts, &s;o he was very apt to ridicule and laugh at any imperfection in another.</Q> Such was the little per&s;on or rather thing that hopped after lady Booby into Mr. Adams's kitchen.</P>
<P>The par&s;on and his company retreated from the chimney-&s;ide, where they had been &s;eated, to give room to the lady and hers. In&s;tead of returning any of the curt&s;ies or extraordinary civilities of Mrs. Adams, the lady turning to Mr. Booby, cried out, <HI>'Quelle B&ecirc;te! Quel animal!'</HI> And pre&s;ently after di&s;covering Fanny (for &s;he did not need the circum|&s;tance of her &s;tanding by Jo&s;eph to a&s;&s;ure the iden|tity of her per&s;on) &s;he a&s;ked the beau, <Q>Whether he did not think her a pretty girl?</Q>&mdash;<Q>Begad, Madam,</Q> an&s;wered he, ''tis the very &s;ame I met.' 'I did not imagine,' replied the lady, <Q>you had &s;o good a ta&s;te.</Q> <Q>Becau&s;e I never liked you, I warrant,</Q> cries the beau. 'Ridiculous!' &s;aid &s;he, <Q>you know you were always my aver&s;ion.</Q><Q> I would never mention aver&s;ion,</Q> an&s;wered the beau, <Q>with that face;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Le&s;t this &s;hould appear unnatural to &s;ome readers, we think proper to acquaint them, that it is taken ver|batim from very polite conver&s;ation.</HI></NOTE> dear lady Booby, wa&s;h

your face before you mention aver&s;ion, I be&s;eech you.</Q> He then laughed, and turned about to co|quet it with Fanny.</P>
<P>Mrs. Adams had been all this time begging and praying the ladies to &s;it down, a favour which &s;he at la&s;t obtained. The little boy to whom the acci|dent had happened, &s;till keeping his place by the fire, was chid by his mother for not being more mannerly: but lady Booby took his part, and com|mending his beauty, told the par&s;on he was his ve|ry picture. She then &s;eeing a book in his hand, a&s;ked, 'if he could read?' 'Yes,' cries Adams, 'a little Latin, Madam, he is ju&s;t got into Quae Ge|nus.' 'A fig for quere genius,' an&s;wered &s;he, 'let me hear him read a little Engli&s;h,'&mdash;<Q>Lege, Dick, Lege,</Q> &s;aid Adams: but the boy made no an&s;wer, 'till he &s;aw the par&s;on knit his brows; and then cried, 'I don't under&s;tand you, father.'&mdash;'How, boy!' &s;ays Adams, <Q>What doth Lego make in the imperative mode?

'A good boy,' &s;ays the father: <Q>And now, child, what is the Engli&s;h of Lego?</Q>&mdash;To which the boy, after long puzzling, an&s;wered, he could not tell.

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The hi&s;tory of two friends, which may afford an u&s;e|ful le&s;&s;on to all tho&s;e per&s;ons who happen to take up their re&s;idence in married families.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>'LEONARD and Paul were two friends,'&mdash;'Pronounce it Lennard, child,' cries the&mdash;par&s;on. 'Pray, Mr. Adams,' &s;ays Lady Booby, 'let your &s;on read without interruption.' Dick then proceeded. Lennard and Paul were two friends, who having been educated together at the &s;ame &s;chool, commenced a friend&s;hip which they pre&s;erved a long time for each other. It was &s;o deeply fixed in both their minds, that a long ab&s;ence, during which they had main|tained no corre&s;pondence, did not eradicate nor le&s;&s;en it: but it revived in all its force at their fir&s;t meeting, which was not till after fifteen years ab&s;ence, mo&s;t of which time Lennard had &s;pent in the Ea&s;t-Indi-es.&mdash;'Pronounce it &s;hort Indies,' &s;ays Adams.&mdash;'Pray, Sir, be quiet,' &s;ays the lady.&mdash;The boy repeated&mdash;in the Ea&s;t-Indies, whil&s;t Paul had &s;erved his king and country in the army. In which different &s;ervices, they had found &s;uch different &s;ucce&s;s, that Lennard was now married, and retired with a fortune of thirty thou&s;and pounds; and Paul
<PB N="169" REF="023370_0390_0FBF6650254A91E0">
was arrived to the degree of a lieutenant of foot; and was not worth a &s;ingle &s;hilling.</P>
<P>The regiment in which Paul was &s;tationed, happened to be ordered into quarters, within a &s;mall di&s;tance from the e&s;tate which Lennard had purcha&s;ed; and where he was &s;ettled. This lat|ter, who was now become a country gentleman, and a ju&s;tice of peace, came to attend the quarter-&s;e&s;&s;ions, in the town where his old friend was quartered. Soon after his arrival, &s;ome affair in which a &s;oldier was concerned, occa&s;ioned Paul to attend the ju&s;tices. Manhood, and time, and the change of climate had &s;o much altered Len|nard, that Paul did not immediately recollect the features of his old acquaintance: but it was otherwi&s;e with Lennard, he knew Paul the mo|ment he &s;aw him: nor could he contain him&s;elf from quitting the bench, and running ha&s;tily to embrace him. Paul &s;tood at fir&s;t a little &s;urpriz|ed; but had &s;oon &s;ufficient information from his friend, whom he no &s;ooner remembered, than he returned his embrace with a pa&s;&s;ion which made many of the &s;pectators laugh, and gave to &s;ome few a much higher and more agreeable &s;en&s;ation.</P>
<P>Not to detain the reader with minute circum|&s;tances, Lennard in&s;i&s;ted on his friend's return|ing with him to his hou&s;e that evening; which reque&s;t was complied with, and leave for a month's ab&s;ence for Paul obtained of the com|manding officer.</P>
<P>If it was po&s;&s;ible for any circum&s;tances to give any addition to the happine&s;s which Paul propo|&s;ed in this vi&s;it, he received that additional plea|&s;ure, by finding on his arrival at his friend's hou&s;e, that his lady was an old acquaintance which he had formerly contracted at his quarters; and
<PB N="170" REF="023370_0391_0FBF6657869F0D98">
who had always appeared to be of mo&s;t agreea|ble temper. A character &s;he had ever maintain|ed among her intimates, being of that number, every individual of which is called quite the be&s;t &s;ort of woman in the world.</P>
<P>But good as this lady was, &s;he was &s;till a wo|man; that is to &s;ay, an angel, and not an angel.&mdash;'You mu&s;t mi&s;take, child, 'cries the par&s;on, 'for you read non&s;en&s;e.' 'It is &s;o in the book,' an&s;wered the &s;on. Mr. Adams was then &s;ilenced by authority and Dick proceeded,&mdash;For though her per&s;on was of that kind to which men attri|bute the name of angel, yet in her mind &s;he was perfectly woman. Of which a great degree of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> gave the mo&s;t remarkable, and perhaps mo&s;t pernicious in&s;tance.</P>
<P>A day or two pa&s;s'd after Paul's arrival, before any in&s;tances of this appear'd; but it was impo&s;|&s;ible to conceal it long. Both &s;he and her hu&s;|band &s;oon lo&s;t all apprehen&s;ion from their friend's pre&s;ence, and fell to their di&s;putes with as much vigour as ever. The&s;e were &s;till pur&s;ued with the utmo&s;t ardour and eagerne&s;s, however trifling the cau&s;es were whence they fir&s;t aro&s;e. Nay, however incredible it may &s;eem, the little con&s;e|quence of the matter in debate was frequently given as a rea&s;on for the fiercene&s;s of the conten|tion, as thus: "If you loved me, &s;ure you would never di&s;pute with me &s;uch a trifle as this." The an&s;wer to which is very obvious; for the argu|ment would hold equally on both &s;ides, and was con&s;tantly retorted with &s;ome addition, as&mdash;I am &s;ure I have much more rea&s;on to &s;ay &s;o, who am in the right. During all the&s;e di&s;putes, Paul always kept &s;trict &s;ilence, and pre&s;erved an even countenance, without &s;hewing the lea&s;t
<PB N="171" REF="023370_0392_0FBF6658E35A52D0">
vi&s;ible inclination to either party. One day, however, when Madam had left the room in a vio|lent fury, Lennard could not refrain from refer|ring his cau&s;e to his friend. Was ever any thing &s;o unrea&s;onable, &s;ays he, as this woman? What &s;hall I do with her? I doat on her to di&s;traction; nor have I any cau&s;e to complain of more than this ob&s;tinacy in her temper; whatever &s;he a&s;&s;erts &s;he will maintain again&s;t all the rea&s;on and con|viction in the world. Pray give me your advice.&mdash;Fir&s;t, &s;ays Paul, I will give my opinion, which is flatly that you are in the wron<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> for &s;uppo&s;ing &s;he is in the wrong, was the &s;ubject of your contention any ways material? What &s;igni|fied it whether you were married in a red or yel|low wai&s;tcoat? for that was your di&s;pute. Now &s;uppo&s;e &s;he was mi&s;taken, as you love her you &s;ay &s;o tenderly, and I believe &s;he de&s;erves it, would it not have been wi&s;er to have yielded, tho' you cer|tainly knew your&s;elf in the right, than to give either her or your&s;elf any unea&s;ine&s;s? For my own part, if ever I marry, I am re&s;olved to enter into an agreement with wife, that in all di&s;putes (e&s;pecially about trifles) that party who is mo&s;t convinced they are right, &s;hall always &s;urrender the victory: by which means we &s;hall both be forward to give up the cau&s;e. I own, &s;aid Len|nard, my dear friend, &s;haking him by the hand, there is great truth and rea&s;on in what you &s;ay and I will for the future endeavour to follow your advice. They &s;oon after broke up the conver&s;a|tion, and Lennard going to his wife a&s;ked her pardon, and told her his friend had convinced him he had been in the wrong. She immediate|ly began a va&s;t encomium on Paul, which he &s;e|conded her, and both agreed he was the worthie&s;t
<PB N="172" REF="023370_0393_0FBF6659E680B080">
and wi&s;e&s;t man upon earth. When next they met, which was at &s;upper, tho' &s;he had promi&s;ed not to mention what her hu&s;band told her, &s;he could not forbear ca&s;ting the kinde&s;t and mo&s;t af|fectionate looks on Paul, and a&s;ked him with the &s;weete&s;t voice, whether &s;he &s;hould help him to &s;ome potted woodcock?&mdash;Potted partridge, my dear, you mean, &s;ays the hu&s;band. My dear-&s;ays &s;he, I a&s;k your friend if he will eat any pot|ted woodcock; and I am &s;ure I mu&s;t know, who potted it. I think I &s;hould know too who &s;hot them, reply'd the hu&s;band, and I am con|vinced that I have not &s;een a woodcock this year; however, tho' I know I am in the right I &s;ub|mit, and the potted partridge is potted woodcock, if you de&s;ire to have it &s;o. It is equal to me, &s;ays &s;he, whether it is one or the other; but you would per&s;uade one out of one's &s;en&s;es; to be &s;ure you are always in the right in your own opi|nion; but your friend, I believe, knows which he is eating. Paul an&s;wered nothing, and the di&s;pute continued, as u&s;ual, the greate&s;t part of the evening. The next morning the lady accident|ally meeting Paul, and being convinced he was her friend, and of her &s;ide, acco&s;ted him thus:&mdash;I am certain, Sir, you have long &s;ince wonder|ed at the unrea&s;onablene&s;s of my hu&s;band. He is indeed, in other re&s;pects, a good &s;ort of man; but &s;o po&s;itive, that no woman but one of my complying temper could po&s;&s;ibly live with him. Why, la&s;t night now, was ever any creature &s;o unrea&s;onable?&mdash;I am certain you mu&s;t condemn him.&mdash;Pray, an&s;wer me, was he not in the wrong? Paul, after a &s;hort &s;ilence, &s;poke as fol|lows: I am &s;orry, Madam, that as good man|ners obliges me to an&s;wer again&s;t my will, &s;o an

adherence to truth forces me to declare my&s;elf of a different opinion. To be plain and hone&s;t, you were entirely in the wrong; the cau&s;e I own not worth di&s;puting, but the bird was undoubted|ly a partridge. O Sir, replied the lady, I cannot po&s;&s;ibly help your ta&s;te&mdash;Madam, returned Paul, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> very little material: for had it been other|wi&s;e, a hu&s;band might have expected &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion&mdash;Indeed!

Pardon me, Madam, an&s;wered Paul; I will apply to your own experi|ence, if you ever found your arguments had that effect.

And Lennard approaching his wife with an air of good-humour, told her he was &s;orry for their fooli&s;h di&s;pute the la&s;t night: but he was now convinced of his error. She an&s;wered &s;miling, &s;he believ|ed &s;he owed his conde&s;cen&s;ion to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> complai|&s;ance; that &s;he was a&s;hamed to think a word had pa&s;s'd on &s;o filly an occa&s;ion, e&s;pecially as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

was &s;atisfy'd &s;he had been mi&s;taken. A little contention followed, but with the utmo&s;t good|will to each other, and was concluded by her a&s;|&s;erting that Paul had thoroughly convinced her &s;he had been in the wrong. Upon which they both united in the prai&s;es of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> friend.</P>
<P>Paul now pa&s;s'd his time with great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">; the&s;e di&s;putes being much le&s;s frequent, as well as &s;horter than u&s;ual: but the devil, or &s;ome unlucky accident, in which perhaps the devil had no hand, &s;hortly put an end to his happine&s;s. He was now eternally the private referee of every dif|ference; in which, after having perfectly, as he thought, e&s;tabli&s;hed the doctrine of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, he never &s;crupled to a&s;&s;ure both privately that they were in the right in every argument, as before he had followed the contrary method. One day a violent litigation happened in his ab&s;ence, and both parties agreed to refer it to his deci&s;ion, The hu&s;band profe&s;&s;ing him&s;elf &s;ure the deci&s;ion would be in his favour; the wife an&s;wer'd, he might be mi&s;taken; for &s;he believed his friend was con|vinced how &s;eldom &s;he was to blame&mdash;and that if he knew all&mdash;The hu&s;band replied&mdash;My dear, I have no de&s;ire of any retro&s;pect; but I believe, if you knew all too, you would not imagine my friend <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> entirely in your &s;ide, Nay; &s;ays &s;he, &s;ince you provoke me, I will mention one in|&s;tance.

My dear, replied the hu&s;band, I will not &s;cruple your veracity; but I a&s;&s;ure you &s;olemnly, on my apply|ing to him, he gave it ab&s;olutely on my &s;ide, and

&s;aid he would have acted in the &s;ame manner. They then proceeded to produce numberle&s;s other in&s;tances, in all which Paul had, on vows of &s;ecre|cy, given his opinion on both &s;ides. In the con|clu&s;ion, both believing each other, they fell &s;evere|ly on the treachery of Paul, and agreed that he had been the occa&s;ion of almo&s;t every di&s;pute which had fallen out between them. They then became extremely loving, and &s;o full of conde|&s;cen&s;ion on both &s;ides, that they vied with each o|ther in cen&s;uring their own conduct, and jointly vented their indignation on Paul, whom the wife, fearing a bloody con&s;equence, earne&s;tly intreated her hu&s;band to &s;uffer him quietly to depart the next day, which was the time fixed for his return to quarters, and then drop his acquaintance.</P>
<P>However ungenerous this behaviour in Ber|nard may be e&s;teemed, his wife obtained a pro|mi&s;e from him (tho' with difficulty) to follow her advice; but they both expre&s;&s;ed &s;uch unu&s;ual cold|ne&s;s that day to Paul, that he, who was quick of apprehen&s;ion, taking Lennard a&s;ide, pre&s;s'd him &s;o home, that he at la&s;t di&s;covered the &s;ecret. Paul acknowledged the truth, but told him the de|&s;ign with which he had done it&mdash;To which the other an&s;wered, he would have acted more friendly to have let him into the whole de&s;ign; for that he might have a&s;&s;ured him&s;elf of his &s;ecre&s;y. Paul replied with &s;ome indignation, he had given him a &s;ufficient proof how capable he was of conceal|ing a &s;ecret from his wife. Lennard returned with &s;ome warmth, he had more rea&s;on to upbraid him, for that he had cau&s;ed mo&s;t of the quarrels between them by his &s;trange conduct, and might (if they had not di&s;covered the affair to each other) have been the occa&s;ion of their &s;eparation.

<P>JO&s;eph Andrews had borne with great unea&s;ine&s;s the impertinence of Beau Didapper to Fanny, who had been talking pretty freely to her, and of|fering her &s;ettlements; but the re&s;pect to the com|pany had re&s;trained him from interfering, whil&s;t the beau confined him&s;elf to the u&s;e of his tongue only; but the &s;aid beau watching an opportunity whil&s;t the ladies eyes were di&s;po&s;ed another way, offered a rudene&s;s to her with his hands; which Jo&s;eph no &s;ooner perceived, than he pre&s;ented him with &s;o &s;ound a box on the ear, that it conveyed him &s;eve|ral paaces from where he &s;tood. The ladies imme|diately &s;creamed out, ro&s;e from their chairs, and the beau as &s;oon as he recovered him&s;elf, drew his hanger, which Adams ob&s;erving, &s;natched up the lid of a pot in his left hand, and covering him&s;elf with it as with a &s;hield, without any weapon of of|fence in his other hand, &s;tept in before Jo&s;eph, and expo&s;ed him&s;elf to the enraged beau, who threaten|ed &s;uch perdition and de&s;truction, that it frighted the women, who were all got in a huddle toge|ther, out of their wits, even to hear his denuncia|tions of vengeance. Jo&s;eph was of a different com|plexion, and begged Adams to let his rival come on; for he had a good cudgel in his hand, and did not fear him. Fanny now fainted into Mrs. A|dams's arms, and the whole room was in confu&s;ion, when Mr. Booby pa&s;&s;ing by Adams, who lay &s;nug

under the pot-lid, came up to Didapper, and in&s;i&s;t|ed on his &s;heathing the hanger, promi&s;ing he &s;hould have &s;atisfaction; which Jo&s;eph declared he would give him, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ight him at any weapon whatever. The beau now &s;heathed his hanger, and taking out a pocket gla&s;s, and vowing vengeance all the time, readju&s;ted his hair; the par&s;on depo&s;ited his &s;hield, and Jo&s;eph running to Fanny &s;oon brought her back to life. Lady Booby chid Jo&s;eph for his in&s;ult on Didapper; but he an&s;wered he would have attacked an army in the &s;ame cau&s;e. 'What cau&s;e?' &s;aid the lady, 'Madam,' an&s;wered Jo&s;eph, <Q>he was rude to that young woman.</Q>&mdash;'What,' &s;ays the lady, <Q>I &s;uppo&s;e he would have ki&s;&s;ed the wench; and is a gentleman to be &s;truck for &s;uch an offer?

he had gone a&s;tray: but I acquit him of that; I can read &s;cripture as well as he; and I never found that the par&s;on was obliged to provide for other folks children; and be&s;ides, he is but a poor curate, and hath little enough, as your lady|&s;hip knows, for me and mine.</Q>&mdash;<Q>You &s;ay ve|ry well, Mrs Adams,</Q> quoth the lady Booby, who had not &s;poken a word to her before, <Q>you &s;eem to be a very &s;en&s;ible woman; and I a&s;&s;ure you, your hu&s;band is acting a very fooli&s;h part, and oppo&s;|ing his own intere&s;t; &s;eeing my nephew is vio|lently &s;et again&s;t this match: and indeed I can't blame him; it is by no means one &s;uitable to our family.</Q> In this manner the lady proceeded with Mrs. Adams, whil&s;t the beau hopped about the room &s;haking his head, partly from pain, and partly from anger; and Pamela was chiding Fanny for her a&s;&s;urance, in aiming at &s;uch a match as her bro|ther.&mdash;Poor Fanny an&s;wered only with her tears, which had long &s;ince begun to wet her handker|chief; which Jo&s;eph perceiving, took her by the arm, and wrapping it in his, carried her off, &s;wear|ing he would own no relation to any one who was an enemy to her he loved more than all the world.

In a word, I was a drummer in an Iri&s;h regiment of foot. Whil&s;t I was in this honourable &s;tation, I attended an officer of our regiment into Eng|land a recruiting. In our march from Bri&s;tol to Froome (for &s;ince the decay of the woolen trade, the clothing towns have furni&s;hed the ar|my with a great number of recruits) we overtook on the road a woman who &s;eemed to be about thirty years old, or thereabouts, not very hand|&s;ome; but well enough for a &s;oldier. As we came up to her, &s;he mended her pace, and falling into di&s;cour&s;e with our ladies, (for every man of the party, namely, a &s;erjeant, two private men, and a drummer, were provided with their women, except my&s;elf) &s;he continued to travel on with us I, perceiving &s;he mu&s;t fall to my lot, advanced pre&s;ently <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> her, made love to her in our military way, and quickly &s;ucceeded to my wi&s;hes.

How I dete&s;t the thought! How much more ex|qui&s;ite is the plea&s;ure re&s;ulting from the reflecti|on of virtue and prudence, than the faint reli&s;h of what flows from vice and folly!

<P>This unexpected account entirely obliterated all tho&s;e admirable reflections which the &s;upreme power of rea&s;on had &s;o wi&s;ely made ju&s;t before. In &s;hort, when de&s;pair, which had more &s;hare in producing the re&s;olutions of hatred we have &s;een taken, began to retreat, the lady he&s;itated a mo|ment, and then forgetting all the purport of her &s;oliloquy, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her woman again, with orders to bid Tom attend her in the parlour, whither &s;he now ha&s;tened to acquaint Pamela with the news. Pamela &s;aid, &s;he could not believe it: For &s;he had
<PB N="187" REF="023370_0408_0FBF6691C1971EA8">
never heard that her mother had lo&s;t any child, or that &s;he had ever had any more than Jo&s;eph and her&s;elf. The lady flew into a violent rage with her, and talked of up&s;tarts and di&s;owning relations, who had &s;o lately been on a level with her. Pa|mela made no an&s;wer: But her hu&s;band, taking up her cau&s;e, &s;everely reprimanded his aunt for her behaviour to his wife; he told her, if it had been earlier in the evening &s;he &s;hould not have &s;taid a moment longer in her hou&s;e; that he was convinced, if this young woman could be proved her &s;i&s;ter, &s;he would readily embrace her as &s;uch; and he him&s;elf would do the &s;ame: He then de&s;ir|red the fellow might be &s;ent for, and the young woman with him; which lady Booby immediately ordered, and thinking proper to make &s;ome apolo|gy to Pamela for what &s;he had &s;aid, it was readily accepted, and all things reconciled.</P>
<P>The pedlar now attended, as did Fanny and Jo|&s;eph, who would not quit her; the par&s;on likewi&s;e was induced, not only by curio&s;ity, of which he had no &s;mall portion, but his duty, as he apprehended it, to follow them; for he continued all the way to exhort them, who were now breaking their hearts, to offer up thank&s;givings, and be joyful for &s;o mira|culous an e&s;cape.</P>
<P>When they arrived at Booby-hall, they were pre|&s;ently called into the parlour, when the pedlar re|peated the &s;ame &s;tory he had told before, and in&s;i&s;t|ed on the truth of every circum&s;tance; &s;o that all who heard him were extremely well &s;atisfied of the truth except Pamela, who imagined, as &s;he had never heard either of her parents mention &s;uch an acci|dent, that it mu&s;t be certainly fal&s;e; and except the lady Booby, who &s;u&s;pected the fal&s;hood of the &s;to|ry from her ardent de&s;ire that it &s;hould be true;
<PB N="188" REF="023370_0409_0FBF6692F7EEAA20">
and Jo&s;eph, who feared its truth, from his earne&s;t wi&s;hes that it might prove fal&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. Booby now de&s;ired them all to &s;u&s;pend their curio&s;ity and ab&s;olute believe or di&s;believe, till the next morning, when he expected old Mr. Andrews and his wife, to fetch him&s;elf and Pamela home in his coach, and then they might be certain of cer|tainly knowing the truth or fal&s;hood of this relati|on; in which he &s;aid, as there were many &s;trong circum&s;tances to induce their credit, &s;o he could not perceive any intere&s;t the pedlar could have in in|venting it, or in endeavouring to impo&s;e &s;uch a fal&s;|hood on them.</P>
<P>The lady Booby, who was very little u&s;ed to &s;uch company, entertained them all, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> her nephew, his wife, her brother and &s;i&s;ter, the beau, and the par&s;on, with great good-humour at her own table. As to the pedlar, &s;he ordered him to be made as welcome as po&s;&s;ible by her &s;ervants. All the com|pany in the parlour, except the di&s;appointed lovers, who &s;at &s;ullen and &s;ilent, were full of mirth: For Mr. Booby had prevailed on Jo&s;eph to a&s;k Mr. Di|dapper's pardon, with which he was perfectly &s;atis|fied. Many jokes pa&s;s'd between the beau and the par&s;on, chiefly on each other's dre&s;s; the&s;e afforded much diver&s;ion to the company. Pamela chid her brother Jo&s;eph or the concern which he expre&s;s'd at di&s;covering a new &s;i&s;ter. She &s;aid, if he loved Fanny as he ought, with a pure affection, he had no rea&s;on to lament being related to her.&mdash;Upon which Adams began to di&s;cour&s;e on Platonic love; whence he made a quick tran&s;ition to the joys in the next world; and concluded with &s;trongly a&s;|&s;erting that there was no &s;uch thing as plea&s;ure in this. At which Pamela and her hu&s;band &s;miled on one another.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Containing &s;everal curious night-adventures, in which Mr. Adams fell into many hair-breadth '&s;capes, partly owing to his goodne&s;s, and partly to his inad|vertency.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>ABOUT an hour after they had all &s;eparated (it being now pa&s;t three in the morning) beau Didapper, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ion for Fanny permitted him not to clo&s;e his eyes, but had employed his imagi|nation in contrivances how to &s;atisfy his de&s;ires, at la&s;t hit on a method by which he hoped to effect it. He had ordered his &s;ervant to bring him word where Fanny lay, and had received his informati|on; he therefore aro&s;e, put on his breeches and night-gown, and &s;tole &s;oftly along the gallery which led to her apartment; and being come to the door, as he imagined it, he opened it with the lea&s;t noi&s;e po&s;&s;ible, and entered the chamber. A &s;avour now invaded his no&s;trils which he did not expect in the room of &s;o &s;weet a young creature, and which might have probably had no good effect on a cooler lover. However, he groped out the bed with difficulty; for there was not a glimp&s;e of light, and opening the curtains, he whi&s;pered in Jo&s;eph's voice, (for he was an excellent mimic) <Q>Fanny, my angel.
<PB N="190" REF="023370_0411_0FBF6696D25B8A08">
I am come to inform thee that I have di&s;covered the fal&s;hood of the &s;tory we la&s;t night heard. I am no longer thy brother, but thy lover; nor will I be delayed the enjoyment of thee one mo|ment longer. You have &s;ufficient a&s;&s;urances of my con&s;tancy not to doubt my marrying you, and it would be want of love to deny me the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of thy charms.</Q>&mdash;So &s;aying, he di&s;encum|bered him&s;elf from the little clothes he had on, and, leaping into bed, embraced his angel, as he conceived her, with great rapture. If he was &s;ur|prized at receiving no an&s;wer, he was no le&s;s plea&s;ed to find his hug returned with equal ardour. He remained not long in this &s;weet confu&s;ion; for both he and his paramour pre&s;ently di&s;covered their error. Indeed it was no other than the accom|pli&s;hed Slip&s;lop whom he had engaged; but tho' &s;he immediately knew the per&s;on whom &s;he had mi&s;taken for Jo&s;eph, he wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">t a lo&s;s to gue&s;s at the repre&s;entative of Fanny. He had &s;o little &s;een or taken notice of this gentlewoman, that light it|&s;elf would have afforded him no a&s;&s;i&s;tance in his conjecture. Beau Didapper no &s;ooner had per|ceived his mi&s;take, than he attempted to e&s;cape from the bed with much greater ha&s;te than he had made to it; but the watchful Slip&s;lop prevented him. For that prudent woman being di&s;appoint|ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> tho&s;e delicious offerings which her fancy had promi&s;ed her plea&s;ure, re&s;olved to make an imme|diate &s;acrifice to her virtue. Indeed &s;he wanted an opportunity to heal &s;ome wounds which her late conduct had, &s;he feared, given her reputation; and as &s;he had a wonderful pre&s;ence of mind, &s;he conceived the per&s;on of the unfortunate beau to be luckily thrown in her way to re&s;tore her lady's o|pinion of her impregnable cha&s;tity. At that in|&s;tant

therefore, when he offered to leap from the bed &s;he caught fa&s;t hold of his &s;hirt, at the &s;ame time roaring out, <Q>O thou villain! thou ha&s;t at|tacked my cha&s;tity, and I believe ruined me in my &s;leep; I will &s;wear a rape again&s;t thee, I will pro|&s;ecute thee with the utmo&s;t vengeance.</Q> The beau attempted to get loo&s;e, but &s;he held him fa&s;t, and when he &s;truggled, &s;he cried out <Q>Murder! murder! rape! robbery! ruin!</Q> At which words par&s;on Adams, who lay in the next chamber, wake|ful, and meditating on the pedlar's di&s;covery, jump|ed out of bed, and, without &s;taying to put a rag of clothes on, ha&s;tened into the apartment whence the cries proceeded.

another &s;troke on his chops, he gave her &s;uch a re|membrance in the guts, that &s;he began to roar loud enough to be heard all over the hou&s;e. Adams then &s;eizing her by the hair (for her double-clout had fallen off in the &s;cuffle) pinned her head down to the bol&s;ter, and then both called for lights toge|ther.</P>
<P>The lady Booby, who was as wakeful as any of her gue&s;ts, had been alarmed from the beginning; and, being a woman of a bold &s;pirit, &s;he &s;lip on a night-gown, petticoat, and &s;lippers, and taking a candle, which always burnt in her chamber, in her hand, &s;he walked undauntedly to Slip&s;lop's room; where &s;he entered ju&s;t at the in&s;tant as Adams had di&s;covered, by the two mountains which Slip&s;lop carried before her, that he was concerned with a fe|male. He then concluded her to be a witch, and &s;aid, he fancied tho&s;e brea&s;ts gave &s;uck to a legion of devils. Slip&s;lop &s;eeing lady Booby enter the room, cried, 'Help! or I am ravi&s;hed,' with a mo&s;t audible voice; and Adams perceiving the light, turned ha&s;tily, and &s;aw the lady (as &s;he did him) ju&s;t as &s;he came to the feet of the bed; nor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> her mode&s;ty, when &s;he found the naked condi|tion of Adams, &s;uffer her to approach farther.&mdash;She then began to revile the par&s;on as the wicked|e&s;t of all men, and particularly railed at his impu|dence in chu&s;ing her hou&s;e for the &s;cene of his de|baucheries, and her own woman for the object of his be&s;tiality. Poor Adams had before di&s;covered the countenance of his bedfellow, and now fir&s;t re|collecting, he was naked, he was no le&s;s confound|ed than lady Booby her&s;elf, and immediately whipt under the bed-clothes; whence the cha&s;te Slip&s;lop endeavoured in vain to &s;hut him out. Then put|ting forth his head, on which by way of ornament,
<PB N="193" REF="023370_0414_0FBF66A2B1E31670">
he wore a flannel nigh-cap, he prote&s;ted his inno|cence, and a&s;ked ten thou&s;and pardons of Mrs. Slip|&s;lop for the blows he had &s;truck her, vowing he had mi&s;taken her for a witch. Lady Booby then ca&s;t|ing her eyes on the ground, ob&s;erved &s;omething &s;parkle with great lu&s;tre, which when &s;he had tak|en it up, appeared to be a very fine pair of diamond buttons for the &s;leeves. A little farther &s;he &s;aw the &s;leeve it&s;elf of a &s;hirt with laced ruffles. <Q>Hey|dey!</Q> &s;ays &s;he, 'what is the meaning of this?'&mdash;'O, Madam,' &s;ays Slip&s;lop, <Q>I don't know what hath happened, I have been &s;o terrified. Here may have been a dozen men in the room.</Q><Q> To whom belongs this laced &s;hirt and jewels,</Q> &s;ays the lady.&mdash;'Undoubtedly,' cries the par&s;on, <Q>to the young gentleman whom I mi&s;took for a woman on coming into the room, whence proceeded all the &s;ub&s;equent mi&s;takes, for if I had &s;u&s;pected him for a man, I would have &s;eized him had he been another Hercules, though indeed he &s;eems rather to re&s;emble Hylas.</Q> He then gave an account of the rea&s;on of his ri&s;ing from bed, and the re&s;t, till the lady came into the room; at which, and the fi|gures of Slip&s;lop and her gallant, who&s;e heads only were vi&s;ible at the oppo&s;ite corners of the bed, &s;he could not refrain from laughter; nor did Slip&s;lop per&s;i&s;t in accu&s;ing the par&s;on of any motions to|wards a rape. The lady therefore de&s;ired him to return to his bed as &s;oon as &s;he was departed, and then ordering Slip&s;lop to ri&s;e and attend her in her own room, &s;he returned her&s;elf thither. When &s;he was gone, Adams renewed his petitions for pardon to Mrs. Slip&s;lop, who, with a mo&s;t chri&s;ti|an temper, not only forgave, but began to move with &s;uch courte&s;y towards him, which he taking as a hint to be gone, immediately quitted the bed, and
<PB N="194" REF="023370_0415_0FBF66A424161D08">
made the be&s;t of his way towards his own; but un|luckily, in&s;tead of turning to the right, he turned to the left, and went to the apartment where Fan|ny lay, who (as the reader may remember) had not slept a wink the preceding night, and who was &s;o hagged out with what had happened to her in the day, that notwith&s;tanding all thoughts of her Jo|&s;eph, &s;he was fallen into &s;o profound a &s;leep, that all the noi&s;e in the adjoining room had not been a|ble to di&s;turb her. Adams groped out the bed, and turning the clothes down &s;oftly, a cu&s;tom Mrs. Adams had long accu&s;tomed him to crept in, and depo&s;ited his carca&s;e on the bed-po&s;t, a place which that good woman had always a&s;&s;igned him.</P>
<P>As the cat or lap-dog of &s;ome lovely nymph for whom ten thou&s;and lovers langui&s;h, lies quietly by the &s;ide of the charming maid, and, ignorant of the &s;cene of delight on which they repo&s;e, meditates the future capture of a mou&s;e, or &s;urpri&s;al of a plate of bread and butter: &s;o Adams lay by the &s;ide of Fanny, ignorant of the paradi&s;e to which he was &s;o near; nor could the emanation of &s;weets which flowed from her breath, overpower the fumes of tobacco which played in the par&s;on's no&s;|trils. And now &s;leep had not overtaken the good man, when Jo&s;eph who had &s;ecretly appointed Fanny to come to her at the break of day, rapped &s;oftly at the chamber-door, which, when he had repeated twice, Adams cried, <Q>Come in, whoever you are.</Q> Jo&s;eph thought he had mi&s;taken the door, though &s;he had given him the mo&s;t exact directions; however, knowing his friend's voice, he opened it, and &s;aw &s;ome female ve&s;tments lying on a chair. Fanny waking at the &s;ame in&s;tant, and &s;tretching out her hand on Adams's beard, &s;he cry'd out.&mdash;'O heavens! where am I?' <Q>Ble&s;s
<PB N="195" REF="023370_0416_0FBF66A5B2DE9928">
me! where am I?</Q> &s;aid the par&s;on. Then Fan|ny &s;creamed, Adams leapt out of bed, and Jo&s;eph &s;tood, as the tragedians call it, like the &s;tatue of Surprize. 'How came &s;he into my room?' cri|ed Adams. 'How came you into her's?' cried Jo&s;eph, in an a&s;toni&s;hment. <Q>I know nothing of the matter,</Q> an&s;wered Adams, <Q>but that &s;he is a ve&s;tal for me. As I am a chri&s;tian, I know not whether &s;he is a man or woman. He is an infidel who doth not believe in witchcraft. They as &s;urely exi&s;t now as in the days of Saul. My clothes are bewitched away too, and Fanny's brought into their place.</Q> For he &s;till in&s;i&s;ted he was in his own apartment; but Fanny denied it vehemently, and &s;aid his attempting to per&s;uade Jo&s;eph of &s;uch a fal&s;hood convinced her of his wicked de&s;ign. 'How!' &s;aid Jo&s;eph in a rage, 'hath he offered any rudene&s;s to you?'&mdash;She an|&s;wered, &s;he could not accu&s;e him of any more than villainou&s;ly &s;tealing to bed to her, which &s;he thought rudene&s;s &s;ufficient, and what no man would do without a wicked intention. Jo&s;eph's great opinion of Adams was not ea&s;ily to be &s;tag|gered, and when he heard from Fanny that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> harm and happened, he grew a little cooler; yet &s;till he was confounded, and as he knew the hou&s;e, and that the women's apartments were on this &s;ide Mrs. Slip&s;lop's room, and the men's on the other, he was convinced that he was in Fanny's chamber. A&s;|&s;uring Adams therefore of this truth, he begged him to give &s;ome account how he came there. A|dams then, &s;tanding in his &s;hirt, which did not of|fend Fanny, as the curtains of the bed were drawn, related all that had happened, and when he had ended. Jo&s;eph told him it was plain he had mi&s;ta|ken, by turning to the right in&s;tead of the left.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Being the la&s;t. In which this true Hi&s;tory is brought to a happy conclu&s;ion.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>FANNY was very little behind her Jo&s;eph, in the duty &s;he expre&s;s'd towards her parents; and the joy &s;he evidenced in di&s;covering them. Gamm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">r Andrews ki&s;s'd her, and &s;aid &s;he was heartily glad to &s;ee her: but for her part &s;he could never love any one better than Jo&s;eph. Gaffer An|drews te&s;tified no remarkable emotion; he ble&s;&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> her, but complained bitterly, that he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> his pipe, not having had a whiff that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P>Mr. Booby, who knew nothing of his aunt's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">, invented her abrupt departure to her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the family into which he was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">; he was therefore de&s;irous to be gone <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> celerity: and now having <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">. Wil&s;on and Jo&s;eph on the di&s;covery, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> Fanny, called her &s;i&s;ter, and introduced <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">, who behaved with great de|cency on the occa&s;ion.</P>

The company were ranged in this mariner. The two old people, with their two daughters, rode in the coach; the &s;quire, Mr. Wil&s;on, Jo&s;eph, par&s;on Adams, and the pedlar proceeded on hor&s;e|back.</P>
<P>In their way Jo&s;eph informed his father of his intended match with Fanny; to which, though he expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome reluctance at fir&s;t, on the eagerne&s;s of his &s;on's in&s;tances he con&s;ented, &s;aying if &s;he was &s;o good a creature as &s;he appeared, and he de&s;cribed her, he thought the di&s;advantages of birth and for|tune might be compen&s;ated. He however <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> on the match being deferred till he had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> mother; in which Jo&s;eph perceiving him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> with great duty obeyed him, to the great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> par&s;on Adams, who by the&s;e means &s;aw an oppor|tunity of fulfilling the church forms, and marrying his pari&s;hioners without a licence.</P>
<P>Mr. Adams greatly exulting on this occa&s;ion (for &s;uch ceremonies were matters of no &s;mall mo|ment with him) accidentally gave &s;pars to his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> which the generous bea&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">; for he was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> high mettle, and had been u&s;ed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> than the gentleman who at pre&s;ent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> him, for who&s;e hor&s;eman&s;hip he had perhaps &s;ome con|tempt, immediately run away full &s;peed, and play|ed &s;o many antic tricks, that he tumbled &s;he par|&s;on from his back; which Jo&s;eph <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> to his relief. This accident afforded <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> to the &s;ervants, and no le&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> Fanny, who beheld him as he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> but the mirth of the one, and terror of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> were &s;oon determined, when the par&s;on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> he received no damage.</P>
<P>The hor&s;e having freed him&s;elf from his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> thy rider, as he probably thought him, proceeded <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

make the be&s;t of his way; but was &s;topped by a gentleman and his &s;ervant who were travelling the oppo&s;ite way; and were now at a little di&s;tance from the coach. They &s;oon met: and as one of the &s;ervants delivered Adams, his hor&s;e, his ma&s;ter hail'd him, and Adams looking up, pre&s;ently recol|lected he was the ju&s;tice of peace before whom he and Fanny had made their appearance. The par|&s;on pre&s;ently &s;aluted him very kindly; and the ju&s;|tice informed him, that he had found the fellow who attempted to &s;wear again&s;t him and the young woman the very next day, and had committed him to Sali&s;bury goal, where he was charged with ma|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> robberies.</P>
<P>Many compliments having pa&s;&s;ed between the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> and the ju&s;tice, the latter proceeded on his journey, and the former having with &s;ome di&s;dain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Jo&s;eph's offer of changing hor&s;es, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> he was as able <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> hor&s;eman as any in the king|dom, remounted his bea&s;t; and now the company again proceeded, and happily arrived at their jour|ney's end, Mr. Adams, by good luck rather than by good riding, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> full.</P>
<P>The company arriving of Mr. Booby's hou&s;e, were all received by him in the mo&s;t courteous, and entertained in the mo&s;t &s;plendid manner, after the cu&s;tom of the old Engli&s;h ho&s;pitality, which is &s;till pre&s;erved in &s;ome very few families in the remote parts of England. They all pa&s;s'd that day with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> utmo&s;t &s;atisfaction; it being perhaps impo&s;&s;ible <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> any &s;et of people more &s;olidly and &s;incerely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. Jo&s;eph and Fanny found means to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> upwards of two hours, which were the short&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, but the &s;weete&s;t imaginable.</P>
<P>In the morning, Mr. Wil&s;on propo&s;ed to his
<PB N="205" REF="023370_0426_0FBF63D9DF7C0B18">
&s;on to make a vi&s;it with him to his mother; which notwith&s;tanding his dutiful inclinations, and a long|ing de&s;ire he had to &s;ee her, a little concerned him, as he mu&s;t be obliged to leave his Fanny: but the goodne&s;s of Mr. Booby relieved him, for he pro|po&s;ed to &s;end his own coach and &s;ix for Mrs. Wil|&s;on, whom Pamela &s;o very earne&s;tly invited, that Mr. Wil&s;on at length agreed with the entreaties of Mr. Booby and Jo&s;eph, and &s;uffered the coach to go empty for his wife.</P>
<P>On Saturday the coach returned with Mrs. Wil|&s;on, who added one more to this happy a&s;&s;embly. The reader may imagine much better and quicker too than I can de&s;cribe, the many embraces and tears of joy which &s;ucceeded her arrival. It is &s;uf|ficient to &s;ay, &s;he was ea&s;ily prevailed with to follow her hu&s;band's example, in con&s;enting to the match.</P>
<P>On Sunday, Mr. Adams performed the &s;ervice at the &s;quire's pari&s;h church, the curate of which very kindly exchanged duty, and rode twenty miles to the lady Booby's pari&s;h &s;o to do; being particularly charged not to omit publi&s;hing the banns, being the third and la&s;t time.</P>
<P>At length the happy day arrived, which was to put Jo&s;eph in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all his wi&s;hes. He a|ro&s;e and dre&s;s'd him&s;elf in a neat but plain &s;uit of Mr. Booby's which exactly fitted him; for he refu&s;|ed all finery; as did Fanny likewi&s;e, who could be prevailed on by Pamela to attire her&s;elf in nothing richer than a white dimity night-gown. Her &s;hift, indeed, which Pamela pre&s;ented her, was of the fine&s;t&punc; kind, and had an edging of lace round the bo&s;om; &s;he likewi&s;e equipped her with a pair of fine white thread &s;tockings, which were all &s;he would accept; for &s;he wore one of her own round-eared caps and, over it a &s;traw hat, lined with cherry coloured <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="206" REF="023370_0427_0FBF63DBD411C1A0">
and tied with a cherry coloured ribbon. In this dre&s;s &s;he came forth from her chamber, blu&s;hing and breathing &s;weets; and was by Jo&s;eph, who&s;e eyes &s;parkled fire, led to church, the whole family attend|ing, where Mr. Adams performed the ceremony; at which nothing was &s;o remarkable, as the extraor|dinary and unaffected mode&s;ty of Fanny, unle&s;s the true chri&s;tian piety of Adams, who pulickly rebuked Mr. Booby and Pamela for laughing in &s;o &s;acred a place, and on &s;o &s;olemn an occa&s;ion. Our par&s;on would have done no le&s;s to the highe&s;t prince on earth: for though he paid all &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and defer|ence to his &s;uperiors in other matters, where the lea&s;t &s;pice of religion intervened, he immediately lo&s;t all re&s;pect of per&s;ons. It was his maxim, that he was a &s;ervant of the Highe&s;t, and could not, without de|parting from his duty, give np the lea&s;t article of his honour, or of his cau&s;e, to the greate&s;t earthly po|tentate. Indeed he always a&s;&s;erted, that Mr. A|dams at church with his &s;urplice on, and Mr. A|dams without that ornament, in any other place, were two very different per&s;ons.</P>
<P>When the church rites were over, Jo&s;eph led his blooming bride back to Mr. Booby's (for the di&s;|tance was &s;o very little, they did not think proper to u&s;e a coach; the whole company attended them likewi&s;e on foot; and now a mo&s;t magnificent en|tertainment was provided, at which par&s;on Adams demon&s;trated an appetite &s;urprizing, as well as &s;ur|pa&s;&s;ing every one pre&s;ent: Indeed the only per&s;ons who betrayed any deficency on this occa&s;ion, were tho&s;e on who&s;e account the fea&s;t was provided: they pampered their imaginations with the much more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> repa&s;t which the approach of night promi&s;|ed them; the thoughts of which filled both their minds, tho' with different &s;en&s;ations; the one all de|&s;ire,
<PB N="207" REF="023370_0428_0FBF63DDED9F0BF0">
the other had her wi&s;hes tempered with fears.</P>
<P>At length, after a day pa&s;&s;ed with the utmo&s;t mer|riment, corrected by the &s;tricte&s;t decency; in which however, par&s;on, Adams, being well filled with ale and pudding, had given a loo&s;e to more facetiou&s;ne&s;s than was u&s;ual to him; the happy, the ble&s;s'd mo|ment arrived, when Fanny retired with her mother, her mother in-law, and her &s;i&s;ter. She was &s;oon un|dre&s;s'd; for &s;he had no jewels to depo&s;it in their ca&s;|kets, nor fine laces to fold with the nice&s;t exactne&s;s. Undre&s;&s;ing to her was properly di&s;covering, not put|ting off ornaments: for as all her charms were the gifts of nature, &s;he could dive&s;t her&s;elf of none. How, reader, &s;hall I give thee an adequate idea of this lovely young creature? the bloom of ro&s;es and lilies might a little illu&s;trate her complexion, or their &s;mell her &s;weetne&s;s: but to comprehend her en|tirely, conceive youth, health, bloom, neatne&s;s, and innocence, in her bridal bed; conceive all the&s;e in their utmo&s;t perfection; and you may place the charming Fanny's picture before your eyes.</P>
<P>Jo&s;eph no &s;ooner heard &s;he was in bed, than he fled with the utmo&s;t eagerne&s;s to her. A minute carried him into her arms, where we &s;hall leave this happy couple to enjoy the private rewards of their con&s;tancy; rewards &s;o great and &s;weet, that I ap|prehend Jo&s;eph neither envied the noble&s;t duke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> nor Fanny the fine&s;t duche&s;s that night.</P>
<P>The third day, Mr. Wil&s;on and his wife, with their &s;on and daughter, returned home; where they now live together in a &s;tate of bli&s;s &s;carce equalled. Mr. Booby hath with unprecedented genero&s;ity giv|en Fanny a fortune of two thou&s;and pounds, which Jo&s;eph hath laid out in a little e&s;tate in the &s;ame pari&s;h with his father, which he now occupies (his father having &s;tocked it for him;) and Fanny pre|&s;ides
<PB N="208" REF="023370_0429_0FBF63DF6554CB10">
with mo&s;t excellent management in his dairy, where, however, &s;he is not at pre&s;ent very able to bu&s;tle much, being, as Mr. Wil&s;on informs me in his la&s;t letter, extremely big with her fir&s;t child.</P>
<P>Mr. Booby hath pre&s;ented Mr. Adams with a living of one hundred and thirty pounds a year: he at fir&s;t refu&s;ed it, re&s;olving not to quit his pari&s;hion|ers, with whom he had lived &s;o long: but on recol|lecting he might keep a curate at this living, he hath been lately induced into it.</P>
<P>The pedlar, be&s;ides &s;everal hand&s;ome pre&s;ents both from Mr. Wil&s;on and Mr. Booby, is by the latter's intere&s;t, made an exci&s;eman; a tru&s;t which he di&s;charges with, &s;uch ju&s;tice, that he is greatly beloved in his neighbourhood.</P>
<P>As for the lady Booby, &s;he returned to London in a few days, where a young captain of dragoons, together with eternal parties at cards, &s;oon oblite|rated the memory of Jo&s;eph.</P>
<P>Jo&s;eph remains ble&s;s'd with his Fanny, whom he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> tenderne&s;s, which is all re|turned on her &s;ide. The happine&s;s of this couple is a perpetual fountain of plea&s;ure to their fond pa|rents; and that is particularly remarkable, he de|clares he will imitate them in their retirement; nor will be prevailed on by any book&s;eller, or their au|thors, to make his appearance in high life.</P>
