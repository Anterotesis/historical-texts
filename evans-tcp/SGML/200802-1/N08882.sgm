<P>THE many and great Advantages ari&s;ing to Society, from the In&s;titution of publick SEMINARIES of LEARN|ING, were &s;o early apparent to the illu&s;trious Sages and venerable Legi&s;lators of Antiquity; that we find &s;uch SCHOOLS nearly coeval with the Dawnings of Science it&s;elf. The Hi&s;tories of the mo&s;t remote Ages inform us, that particular Cla&s;&s;es of Men, under various Denominations in different Coun|tries, were employed and &s;et apart as the <HI>Depo&s;itaries</HI> or <HI>Pre&s;ervers</HI> of all the Learning then known; who&s;e Duty it was by further Ob|&s;ervations of their own, to rectify or improve whatever had been communicated to them; and afterwards to tran&s;mit the whole, without re&s;erve, to their Succe&s;&s;ors. The&s;e Men from their re|tired Life, reputed Sanctity, and Knowledge of the Powers of na|tural Bodies, and when Patriarchal Authority had now for &s;ome Time been &s;unk in that of ri&s;ing States and Empires, would na|turally be con&s;idered in Days of Ignorance and Simplicity, as a &s;uperior Order of Beings, and as holding immediate Conver&s;e with Heaven; and therefore they were u&s;ually entru&s;ted at the &s;ame Time, with the Direction of all the religious Rites and Ce|remonies practi&s;ed among them, in the Wor&s;hip of their &s;everal local Divinities: But that their Attention might not be taken off from the&s;e different Ta&s;ks or Studies, by the Nece&s;&s;ity of pro|viding them&s;elves with Food and Raiment, they were for the mo&s;t Part maintained at the publick Expence. So profu&s;ely liberal had the Kings of EGYPT been to their <HI>Seminaries</HI> or <HI>Colleges</HI> of learned Men, that as <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> tells us, one third Part of the whole Country was anciently allotted for the Support of the <HI>Prie&s;ts;</HI> who, he adds, were al&s;o all <HI>Phy&s;icians,</HI> or &s;killed in the Art of Healing. The&s;e Prie&s;ts, by &s;ome called <HI>Hierophantes,</HI> or Expounders of &s;acred Things, derived the Origin of their In&s;ti|tution from the earlie&s;t Ages; and were reputedly the mo&s;t learn|ed Body of Men then known in the World, wherever Policy and good Government had been e&s;tabli&s;hed. For it may be affirmed from natural Rea&s;on, as well as from all the credible Hi&s;tories of ancient Nations, that none of the liberal Arts or Sciences ever made any con&s;iderable Progre&s;s, but where good Order and Go|vernment had been fir&s;t introduced and properly maintained. LAWS are nece&s;&s;ary both for the Security of the Per&s;ons and Properties of Men, and from that Ea&s;e and Happine&s;s which are the ne|ce&s;&s;ary Con&s;equences of &s;uch Security, proceeds Curio&s;ity, and an emulous De&s;ire of di&s;tingui&s;hing them&s;elves either by &s;uc|ce&s;sful Re&s;earches into the Nature and U&s;es of the Objects around

them; or by &s;uch other Inventions and Di&s;coveries as are advan|tageous to them&s;elves, or Neighbours: The happy Re&s;ult of all which is SCIENCE or Knowledge.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the EGYPTIAN COLLEGES already mentioned, we find &s;imilar In&s;titutions among &s;everal other Nations of Antiquity; &s;ome of which I &s;hall give a &s;ummary Account of.</P>
<P>Among the mo&s;t ancient of the&s;e are the CHALDAEANS: They are noticed by that Name in Scripture, &s;o early as in the Days of <HI>Abraham,</HI> who is there &s;aid to have been born in their Country. Tho' the CHALDAEANS are frequently &s;poken of as a Nation of ASSYRIA, the Name is now mo&s;t generally under&s;tood of a cer|tain Body of learned Men di&s;tinct from the Re&s;t of the Citizens; who&s;e &s;ole Bu&s;ine&s;s was Study; who lived in and about <HI>Babylon;</HI> and were famous for their Knowledge of A&s;tronomy. The Phi|lo&s;opher <HI>Calli&s;then<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s,</HI> who attended <HI>Alexander</HI> on his Expedition again&s;t <HI>Darius,</HI> &s;ent <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> an Account of A&s;tronomical Ob&s;er|vations made by the <HI>Chaldaeans,</HI> from nearly the Time of the Mo&s;aical Deluge. They fir&s;t invented <HI>Judicial A&s;trology,</HI> or pre|tended to foretel Events from the Influence and relative A&s;pects of the Stars and Con&s;tellations. They were much con&s;ulted in Di&s;ea&s;es, which they pretended to cure by Charms, and the A|gency of invi&s;ible Powers, more than by the Medicinal Herbs they u&s;ed on the&s;e Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>The CABEIRI was an Appellation &s;ometimes u&s;ed by the Anci|ents for their Great Gods, &s;o called; but mo&s;t generally for the Prie&s;ts, who performed their &s;acred Rites, and taught their Man|ner of Wor&s;hip. They fir&s;t came from <HI>Phoenicia,</HI> and &s;ettled in <HI>Samothrace:</HI> They affected great Secrecy in their Ceremonies; and u&s;ed certain Forms of Initiation into their My&s;teries, by placing their Pupils upon a Throne, and dancing round them; after which they put a Girdle about them, which was thought to po&s;&s;e&s;s great Virtues.</P>
<P>The CURETES, &s;o called from keeping their Hair &s;hort, and the CORYBANTES, were different Names for the Prie&s;ts of <HI>Cybe|le</HI> or <HI>Rhea,</HI> the fabled Mother of the Gods. They were &s;ometimes called <HI>Idaei Dactyli,</HI> from their Number; and from Mount <HI>Ida</HI> near <HI>Troy,</HI> where <HI>Cybele</HI> was held in particular Veneration. The&s;e Prie&s;ts went from <HI>Phrygia,</HI> and took up their Re&s;idence in the I&s;land of <HI>Crete;</HI> where they were &s;aid to have been intru&s;ted with the Education of JUPITER; when to prevent the Cries of the young God from being heard by his Father <HI>Saturn,</HI> they invented the noi&s;y and warlike Dances in Armour, to the Sound of Drums and Flutes, which afterwards became Part of their e&s;tabli&s;hed Wor&s;hip. They were expert in the Science of Augury and Divi|nation.
<PB N="3" REF="011338_0006_0F85805F9EC85348">
They applied them&s;elves much to A&s;tronomy, to Phy&s;i|ology or the Study of Nature, and to Poetry. They are &s;aid to have fir&s;t in&s;tructed the <HI>Cretans</HI> to build Cities, and to live in So|cieties; to manage Flocks and Bees; and to make and u&s;e Ar|mour. STRABO mentions this Order of Prie&s;ts by the Name of the COLLEGE of the CURETES; and as performing yearly Sa|crifices in Honour of the Birth of <HI>Apollo</HI> and <HI>Diana.</HI></P>
<P>The TELCHINES came fir&s;t to <HI>Greece</HI> from the I&s;land of <HI>Rhodes,</HI> whither they had removed from <HI>Egypt:</HI> They were un|doubtedly of the Tribe of the Prie&s;ts in <HI>Egypt,</HI> the Inventors or Pre&s;ervers of the &s;acred <HI>Hieroglyphick</HI> Characters, and of the other Methods by which they concealed their Learning from the Vulgar; for they were very &s;crupulous and re&s;erved in communicating their Knowledge. The <HI>Greeks</HI> &s;peak of them as the Inventors of Arts; who fir&s;t taught them to rear Temples, to carve Images, and to practi&s;e regular Ceremonies in the Wor&s;hip of their Deities. They were al&s;o great <HI>Magicians,</HI> and pretended to work Wonders by Charms, Incantations, and certain Drugs, who&s;e Qualities they were acquainted with. They were probably the &s;ame as <HI>Pharoah's</HI> Sorcerers or wi&s;e Men; who are &s;aid in Scripture to have done &s;uch &s;upernatural Feats, in Imitation of the Miracles performed by <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> in <HI>Egypt.</HI> They were al&s;o much given to Proce&s;&s;ions and Shows; and to all the other Arts by which they could excite Ad|miration in Mankind, and Reverence for them&s;elves, and their Profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In the Book of JOSHUA we read of a City of <HI>Pale&s;tine</HI> or <HI>Ca|naan</HI> called <HI>Ciriath-Sepher,</HI> which literally &s;ignifies the <HI>City</HI> of <HI>Books</HI> or of <HI>Letters;</HI> as the <HI>Canaanites</HI> and e&s;pecially the <HI>Sidonians</HI> are known to have even then made great Progre&s;s in Arts and Learning, it is generally believed that they had in tho&s;e Times, publick Schools or <HI>Colleges</HI> in <HI>Ciriath-Sepher,</HI> in which were taught the Sciences or Philo&s;ophy of tho&s;e Ages; and that this City had its Name from the&s;e Circum&s;tances, and the Number of learned Men who u&s;ed to a&s;&s;emble in it, for Study, or mutual Improve|ment.</P>
<P>It is certain that there were COLLEGES among the JEWS, in the Time of SAMUEL, even for the In&s;truction of their Prophets in the Rites and Ceremonies of their Religion; and other My&s;te|ries of that important Profe&s;&s;ion. Here is &s;uch an Encomium upon Learning, as exceeds all the Powers of Man to equal: By this we are given to under&s;tand that Learning was conducive to In&s;piration, and a more familiar Intercour&s;e with the Deity; and was the eligible Vehicle of his revealed Will to that favourite People. Accordingly in the prophetic Writings we find many beautiful De&s;criptions, ingenious Allegories, and in&s;tructive mo|ral
<PB N="4" REF="011338_0007_0F8580605CCD2F28">
Truths, delivered in a Stile truly Poetical and Sublime. We are al&s;o told in the Jewi&s;h Hi&s;tory, that HULDAH, the Prophete&s;s, dwelt in the COLLEGE at Jeru&s;alem.</P>
<P>The SALII or Prie&s;ts of MARS, were in&s;tituted at ROME by <HI>Numa,</HI> for keeping the <HI>Aneilia</HI> or &s;acred Bucklers: They had a PRAESU<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> or chief Director; and they were called the COLLEGE of the SALII. This Name was given them, becau&s;e they danced in Armour thro' the Streets in their Proce&s;&s;ions, in a certain Ca|dence, continually beating upon their Bucklers; on which Oc|ca&s;ion they were accompanied with a Number of young Virgins in particular Habits, &s;inging the <HI>Saliare Carmen,</HI> or Song of their Order.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e, we read that there were anciently COLLEGES of the <HI>Per&s;ian Magi,</HI> and of the <HI>Indian Gymno&s;ophi&s;ts</HI> or <HI>Bramins;</HI> which In&s;titutions exi&s;t in the Ea&s;t at this Day: And the COLLEGES of the <HI>Druids,</HI> or <HI>Semnotheans</HI> both in <HI>Gaul</HI> and <HI>Britain,</HI> are fre|quently mentioned in the Roman and other Hi&s;tories. The&s;e Col|leges were inferior to none of the others, either in Antiquity, Regularity, or popular Influence. Their Learning and Opinions &s;hall be more particularly con&s;idered hereafter.</P>
<P>It may be ob&s;erved in general of all the&s;e INSTITUTIONS or publick SEMINARIES; that they were u&s;ually compo&s;ed of Men di&s;tingui&s;hed by their Birth, Learning, and Abilities, &s;et apart for the Care of their religious Tenets and Ceremonies; and that they were the e&s;tabli&s;h'd SCHOOLS for the In&s;truction of Youth.</P>
<P>The&s;e Outlines or imperfect Models of PUBLICK ACADEMIES or SCHOOLS, whether derived from the In&s;titutions above-menti|oned, or from &s;ome other Denomination of learned Men, among Nations, who&s;e Hi&s;tories have not reached our Times, were warmly adopted and greatly improved by the <HI>Greeks:</HI> Among them we find the fine Arts more generally diffu&s;ed and culti|vated, than among the other Nations of Antiquity. This indeed might naturally be expected from the inqui&s;itive Genius and li|beral Sentiments of the free born. Sons of <HI>Greece;</HI> who&s;e unwea|ried Diligence in the Pur&s;uit of, and inextingui&s;hable Avidity for Knowledge, often prompted them to explore di&s;tant Lands, to vi&s;it many and Strange Nations, and to brave all oppo&s;ing Dif|ficulties and Dangers, in Order to participate of every Trea&s;ure of Learning, wherever it could be found. Of this there are many In&s;tances in Hi&s;tory; and it has been ob&s;erved, that one of the greate&s;t Encomiums be&s;towed upon the &s;agacious ULYSSES is, that he</P>
<Q><PB N="5" REF="011338_0008_0F858063850B36C8">
<L>" Wandering from Clime to Clime, ob&s;ervant &s;tray'd,</L>
<L>" Their Manners noted, and their States &s;urvey'd."</L></Q>
<BIBL>POPE.</BIBL>
<P>Nor was this Cu&s;tom of Travelling confined to the <HI>Greeks.</HI> The famed ZOROASTER travelled over <HI>Indo&s;tan,</HI> as far as the <HI>Ganges,</HI> to be in&s;tructed in the ancient Philo&s;ophy of the <HI>Bramins,</HI> who, even in his Time, were celebrated for the Innocence of their Lives, and Purity of their Doctrines; and the <HI>Gentoo</HI> An|nals, &s;till pre&s;erved in <HI>India,</HI> mention both him and PYTHAGO|RAS, as Travellers into that Country, in Search of Knowledge. The <HI>Hyperborean</HI> Philo&s;opher and <HI>Briti&s;h Druid</HI> ABARIS, is men|tioned by &s;everal Greek Writers, as travelling over the Conti|nent of <HI>Europe</HI> to <HI>Athens</HI> and <HI>Delos,</HI> and from thence into <HI>Italy.</HI> ANACHARSIS was a noble <HI>Scythian</HI> who came to <HI>Greece</HI> for Im|provement; from thence he vi&s;ited CROESUS in <HI>Lydia;</HI> and af|terwards was killed in his own Country, for endeavouring to in|troduce the Grecian Cu&s;toms. ERILLUS, and CLITOMACHUS, otherwi&s;e called ASDRUBAL, were <HI>Carthaginians</HI> who came to <HI>Greece,</HI> for In&s;truction; as did MENIPPUS from <HI>Phoenicia.</HI></P>
<P>We read of many more inqui&s;itive Sages of Old, who quitted their native Countries to vi&s;it di&s;tant Regions, in Que&s;t of Learn|ing. From the&s;e renowned Travellers of Antiquity, is derived the modern fa&s;hionable Practice, of vi&s;iting foreign Countries for Improvement; which was adopted &s;oon after the Revival of Learning in <HI>Europe;</HI> and is &s;till con&s;idered, by Men of generous Minds and enlarged Under&s;tandings, not only as a genteel and u&s;e|ful Accompli&s;hment, but as the fini&s;hing Part of Polite Education.</P>
<P>Since tho&s;e more remote Times, Learning has been &s;o exten|&s;ively branched out into various Arts, Sciences, or Profe&s;&s;ions; by the many curious and amazing Di&s;coveries communicated to the World, within the&s;e few la&s;t Centuries; and by the innu|merable u&s;eful and intere&s;ting Improvements made in all its &s;e|veral Departments; that the munificent Founders, and generous Benefactors of modern UNIVERSITIES have been thereby induced to a&s;&s;ign competent Allowances, for the Support of particular Pro|fe&s;&s;ors or Teachers in each nece&s;&s;ary Branch&punc; Who with Abiliti|es not inferior, tho' with A&s;&s;i&s;tances and Advantages infinitely &s;uperior to the <HI>Antients,</HI> are neverthele&s;s con&s;idered as both u&s;e|fully and nece&s;&s;arily employed for them&s;elves, and the Public, in attending to, and improving the &s;ingle Part alloted them.</P>
<P>By the Example of the&s;e <HI>European</HI> Nations, who have di&s;tin|gui&s;hed them&s;elves as Encouragers of Learning and Patrons of Science; and more particularly by the Example, and with the Countenance and A&s;&s;i&s;tance of tho&s;e Countries, which, with that
<PB N="6" REF="011338_0009_0F8580645C12EB90">
affectionate Re&s;pect due to the Birth Place of our Fathers, and tho&s;e Sentiments of Gratitude we &s;o ju&s;tly owe for their generous Pro|tection and Aid in that Undertaking, we more emphatically call the MOTHER COUNTRIES; a <HI>Seminary</HI> of <HI>Learning,</HI> has for &s;ome Time pa&s;t been e&s;tabli&s;hed and endowed in this City, with a public Spiritedne&s;s and Liberality worthy of its Founders; and which will, we hope, reflect Honour upon their Memories, and tho&s;e of its kind Benefactors, while lives the Love of Letters,&mdash;while Merit meets Reward.</P>
<P>To render the Influence of this COLLEGE more exten&s;ive and beneficial to Mankind, the re&s;pectable Governors have, with their u&s;ual Benevolence, been plea&s;ed to countenance and cheri&s;h the infant and well-meant Endeavours of a few Gentlemen of the Medical Profe&s;&s;ion here, to erect a SCHOOL of PHYSICK; by be&s;towing upon each of them the Titles, Privileges, and Immu|nities of PROFESSORS in it, of &s;uch &s;eparate Branches of Medi|cine as they have &s;everally engaged to teach. For the&s;e di&s;tin|gui&s;hed Marks of Favour, it is with the greate&s;t Alacrity and Plea&s;ure, that I embrace this fir&s;t Opportunity, in my own Name, and in the Names of my Brother Profe&s;&s;ors, of making our &s;in|cere Acknowledgements to the worthy and patriotic GOVERNORS, for that Protection and Encouragement they have &s;o chearfully afforded to our Undertaking, and the Honours they have been plea&s;ed to confer upon us: And in a particular Manner we re|turn our unfeigned and mo&s;t cordial Thanks to the THREE GENTLEMEN of the COMMITTEE<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">DR. S. AUCHMUTY, Rector of Trinity Church DR. M. COOPER, Pre|&s;ident of King's College, and J. T. KEMPE, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> his Maje&s;ty's Attorney Ge&punc;</NOTE> appointed to confer with us; who&s;e great Good-Sen&s;e and Politene&s;s were not only u&s;eful, but nece&s;&s;ary in removing many Ob&s;tacles which occured to the Execution of our intended Plan; and who&s;e &s;teady and unweari|ed Attention to the Reputation and Intere&s;t of this COLLEGE, are only &s;urpa&s;&s;ed by their Humanity and general Good-Will to Mankind, &s;o con&s;picuous in their Endeavours to promote and improve the great ART of HEALING.</P>
<P>When we con&s;ider that the mo&s;t civilized and polite Nations on Earth, have formerly at &s;ome Period lived as the mo&s;t Savage and Ignorant do at this Day; we have great Rea&s;on to extol the Sagacity and Addre&s;s of our Ance&s;tors, for inventing, cultivating, and improving the Arts and Sciences. To enumerate the Bene|fits we derive from their Indu&s;try; the many Conveniencies and Plea&s;ures of Life which their Di&s;cernment and Good Sen&s;e have put us in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of; or the Labours and Inquietudes we have been delivered from, by their profitable and &s;ucce&s;sful Endeavours; would be a Ta&s;k not more difficult than unnece&s;&s;ary; as it would
<PB N="7" REF="011338_0010_0F858065A8C608B8">
be doubting the Judgment of this learned AUDIENCE; as well as their Knowledge of Men and Books: I &s;hall therefore con|fine my &s;ub&s;equent Di&s;cour&s;e to the pre&s;ent Occa&s;ion of bringing together this re&s;pectable and polite Company; and to what is properly the Subject of this pre&s;ent In&s;titution.</P>
<P>The ART of HEALING, as is ob&s;erved by the learned Dr. PITCAIRN, mu&s;t certainly be of greater Antiquity than the Study of PHILOSOPHY; becau&s;e in the Beginning of the World, every one would be determined to tho&s;e Studies of PHYSICK or PHI|LOSOPHY, according as the Feelings of Man's Body, or the Amu&s;ements of his Mind fir&s;t excited his Attention. Now it is mo&s;t probable, that the Rea&s;ons for PHILOSOPHY were only ac|cidental or ca&s;ual; for Men then only addicted them&s;elves to philo&s;ophi&s;ing, when, after experiencing the Efficacy of Reme|dies, they could in &s;ome Security and at Leizure con&s;ider the Qualities of Natural Bodies, and think of excelling the Re&s;t of Mankind in the Powers of the Under&s;tanding: Whereas the Rea&s;ons for PHYSICK, or the Pre&s;ervation of Health, were per|petual; and, from the earlie&s;t U&s;e of Man's Faculties, naturally connected with his Well-being and Exi&s;tence. The SCIENCE of MEDICINE is al&s;o more u&s;eful, more honourable than that of PHILOSOPHY; by how much the more rea&s;onable it is, that our Care for the Life of Man, &s;hould exceed that of gratifying his Curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>By the Word MEDICINE, the Ancients under&s;tood every Thing which related to the Art of Healing; as by the Appellation of PHYSICIAN<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign">, Medicus,&mdash;a Healer.</NOTE>, they meant every one who practi&s;ed that Art, whether the pre&s;criptive, or manual Parts of it.</P>
<P>MAN, from the Beginning, &s;eems to have been formed by his CREATOR, &s;ubject to Changes, and even to Death it&s;elf; equal|ly with all the other living Productions of Nature. The Structure of his Body, the Functions nece&s;&s;ary to the Pre&s;ervation of Life, Motion and Re&s;t, Watching and Sleep, and even Health it&s;elf, are ultimately productive of Infirmities and Sickne&s;s: The daily Nece&s;&s;ity of fre&s;h Supplies of Meat and Drink, to recruit the continual Wa&s;te of the Body, by the Actions of Life; the Air he breathes, filled with Exhalations of very different Properties, ac|cording as they a&s;cend from the Earth in the Day, or de&s;cend from the &s;urrounding Atmo&s;phere in the Night; the various and &s;udden Changes of the Weather, from hot, cold, moi&s;t, dry, to their &s;everal Oppo&s;ites; or the long and uninterrupted Cold and Heat of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Days and Nights; the Influence of the Sun and Moon upon our Bodies, thro' the Medium of the Atmo&s;phere; and the varying Sea&s;ons of the Year; <HI>all</HI> mu&s;t occa&s;ion &s;uch Al|terations

<P>The fir&s;t Race of Mankind, expo&s;ed in the Forre&s;ts or open Fields, to the &s;udden Changes and Inclemencies of the Weather, mu&s;t have maintained their Life in no very comfortable Conditi|on. Unacquainted with tho&s;e Luxuries and Abu&s;es of natural Benefits, which have &s;ince their Time been &s;o much followed and refined upon, it is agreed among all the antient Writers of every Country and Denomination, who have treated that Subject, and Rea&s;on it&s;elf confirms it to us, that their whole Su&s;tenance con|&s;i&s;ted in the Seeds, Herbs, and Roots of their own and Nature's Tillage, ju&s;t as they grew and pre&s;ented them&s;elves to their Hand; joined with the &s;ucculent Fruits of Shrubs and Trees; and diluted with the cool and refre&s;hing Draughts from the pure Stream or Fountain. This Diet of the primitive Ages would vary, according to the different Productions of their re&s;pective Countries; whence many Nations were anciently di&s;tingui&s;hed by Names expre&s;&s;ive of that particular Food mo&s;t generally u&s;ed among them, or with which their Country chic&s;ty abounded: Thus we are told that the <HI>Arcadians</HI> lived in former Times upon <HI>Acorns;</HI> the <HI>Argives</HI> on <HI>Pears;</HI> the <HI>Athenians</HI> on <HI>Figgs;</HI> other Nations are &s;aid to have fed chie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">y on <HI>Beech Ma&s;t;</HI> and to keep up the Remembrance of the&s;e Days of Innocence and Frugality, it was cu&s;tomary at <HI>Athens,</HI> to pre&s;ent the new married Pair on the Day of their Nuptials, with a Ba&s;ket of Acorns mixed with Bread. However, let us ob&s;erve by the by, that probably the Acorns in the&s;e &s;outhern Latitudes differed in Quality, from tho&s;e known to us; and that other Kinds of Shell Fruits might be comprehended under that Name. But when we con&s;ider the Na|ture of this Diet, we mu&s;t allow that, tho' it is very proper for <HI>Cattle</HI> and the <HI>feathered Tribes,</HI> who&s;e Organs are adapted to &s;uch Aliment, it could not be &s;o fit for or agreeable to MAN, who is of a more delicate Texture: For the mo&s;t delicious Fruits are cold, and afford but little Nouri&s;hment; Seeds, without previous Dre&s;&s;ing, are flatulent, and hard to dige&s;t; and Herbs and Roots are &s;till more har&s;h and crude. This is the uncontroverted Opinion

of Phy&s;icians in all Ages and Climates. HIPPOCRATES &s;ays, that in the Beginning Men u&s;ed the &s;ame Food as the Bea&s;ts; and that the many Di&s;tempers, brought upon them by &s;uch indige&s;tible Aliment, taught them in Length of Time to find out a different Diet, better &s;uited to their Con&s;titutions: And the &s;ame Rea&s;ons no doubt, &s;ugge&s;ted the fir&s;t E&s;&s;ays of improving the Ta&s;te, and meliorating the Nature of &s;uch ungrateful Food, by Means of Fire.</P>
<P>The U&s;e of MILK was probably an early Acqui&s;ition to the Diet of the primitive Ages. This being a ready Article of Food, more palatable, and better &s;uited to their Powers of Dige&s;tion, than any other then known, will ea&s;ily account for that Attention and Care with which the Men of tho&s;e Times pre&s;erved and multiplied their Herds and Flocks, in which con&s;i&s;ted all their Riches; and for that perpetual De&s;ire they had to roam and change their Pla|ces of Abode, in their Function of <HI>Shepherds,</HI> for the Convenience of finding fre&s;h Pa&s;ture and Water. Thus the SCYTHIANS were &s;ometimes called GALACTOPHAGI, or MILK-EATERS, by the <HI>Greeks,</HI> from their feeding much upon that nutritious Fluid.</P>
<P>The Simplicity of their Diet could only be equaled by that of their Cloathing and Habitations. The Skin of &s;ome Animal, ac|cidentally found dead, or of &s;ome devouring Bea&s;t of Prey, killed perhaps in Self-defence, was probably the fir&s;t Covering that was wore, either for U&s;e or Ornament: As their Canopy was the Sky; a natural Grotto; or &s;ome temporary Shelter of Branches and Leaves; agreeable to their Nece&s;&s;ities, and &s;uited to their Cir|cum&s;tances.</P>
<P>At what Time the U&s;e of ANIMAL FOOD was fir&s;t introduced, is not ea&s;ily a&s;certained. PLUTARCH wonders what Soul or Senti|ments the Man had, who fir&s;t with his Mouth touched Blood, or the Fle&s;h of &s;laughtered Animals; and thinks that nothing but extreme Nece&s;&s;ity could have introduced &s;uch a Practice. When we con&s;ider the helple&s;s Condition of Man, in his State of Nature; how he is comparatively unprovided with Weapons of Offence or Defence; and if we reflect that there is in every Man, unprac|ti&s;ed in the Ways of Blood, an innate Abhorrence to deprive of Life, or di&s;pa&s;&s;ionately to butcher an inoffen&s;ive Brute, from a preconceived De&s;ire of eating its Body; we cannot believe that he was originally formed by his CREATOR for an <HI>Animal</HI> of <HI>Prey.</HI> This is further confirmed from <HI>comparative Anatomy;</HI> by which it is evident, that his In&s;truments of Manducation and Dige&s;tion more nearly re&s;emble tho&s;e of <HI>Graminivorous,</HI> than of <HI>Carnivorous</HI> Ani|mals. Thus ADAM, among other Injunctions given him, is told; <HI>That every Herb bearing Seed, and every Tree in which is the Fruit of a Tree yielding Seed, &s;hall be to him for Meat:</HI> But, tho' Dominion

is expre&s;sly given him over all living Creatures, in every Ele|ment, he is no where told that he might kill, or eat of them: And it is as true as remarkable, that excepting tho&s;e human Figures which inhabit near the frozen Seas to the <HI>North</HI> of <HI>Europe,</HI> and who from Nece&s;&s;ity live almo&s;t entirely upon <HI>Fi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Sea Fowls;</HI> the principal Part of Man's Food in all other known Regions of the World, from the fierce Savages of AMERICA, to the wandering Hordes of TARTARY, and the &s;ooty Tribes of AFRICA, has ever been, and &s;till continues to be <HI>Vegetable.</HI> But by whatever Means Man was fir&s;t tempted to act &s;o contrary to the Feelings of Huma|nity, as to de&s;troy Animals for Food; whether from the Example of Savage Bea&s;ts, the grateful Odour of Burnt-Offerings, Curio|&s;ity, dire Nece&s;&s;ity, a Spirit of Revenge, or by whatever Motive he was induced to make the bold E&s;&s;ay; the fir&s;t Account we have of Animals being the de&s;tined Prey of Man, is in that formal Per|mi&s;&s;ion addre&s;&s;ed to NOAH, immediately after the Flood, in the&s;e Words; <HI>Every moving Thing that liveth, &s;hall be Meat for you; even as the green Herb have I given you all Things:</HI> And it is the gene|ral Opinion of <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Writers,</HI> that no &s;uch Food was u&s;ed, till after the Deluge. This Permi&s;&s;ion to eat Meat, when con&s;i|dered &s;imply and in it&s;elf, will appear to have been only a partial Favour: For crude Fle&s;h quickly putrifies, more e&s;pecially when a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the natural Heat of the Body; while notwith&s;tanding, the human Stomach and Bowels, from the Delicacy of their Structure and Length of their Tube, are unable to di&s;charge the putrid <HI>Faeces</HI> &s;o expeditiou&s;ly as is done by Bea&s;ts by Nature formed for Prey, and who&s;e Inte&s;tines are not only &s;horter, but al&s;o more firm and mu&s;cular: Wherefore it is obvious that the Eating of raw Meat mu&s;t have been attended with very pernici|ous Con&s;equences, before the various Methods of dre&s;&s;ing it by Fire, and other Contrivances for pre&s;erving it, were found out; in order to retard its Tendency to Putrefaction, and accommodate this Di&s;po&s;ition to the Powers of Dige&s;tion in Man, and to the Length of Time it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily remain in his Body. Thus the ART of COOKERY, however it may have admini&s;tred to the Folly or Luxury of later Times, was undoubtedly, in its Origin, not more &s;imple than proper and nece&s;&s;ary; and like other pro|phylactick Remedies or <HI>Pre&s;ervatives,</HI> was at fir&s;t practi&s;ed for the &s;ole Purpo&s;es of Health and Convenience. Phy&s;icians often form very ju&s;t Opinions re&s;pecting the Nature of the humane Juices, and the general State of Health, from that particular Kind of Food chiefly u&s;ed, whether it be Animal or Vegetable; and &s;ome have even pretended to judge of Men's Tempers and Di&s;po&s;ition, from eating their animal Food much dre&s;&s;ed, crude, or nearly &s;o.

Life of ANCHORETS in different Parts of the World, it is well known that, of the pre&s;ent religious Orders among&s;t the Roman Catholicks, the CARTHUSIANS and MINIMS never eat Meat: and the rigid Order of LA TRAPPE, never eat any Thing which has ever had Life in it; They live entirely on Vegetables, culti|vated by their own Hands. The COLLOYERS, a Sect of <HI>Greek Monks,</HI> never eat Meat; and on Fa&s;t Days they u&s;e Vegetables only. There is another Sect of <HI>Greek</HI> Devotees called ASCETAI, who live reclu&s;e in the Mountains upon Vegetables alone: Many Religious among the <HI>Armenians</HI> never eat Meat; and among the <HI>Japane&s;e</HI> we are told, that many of their Prie&s;ts and other De|votees are no le&s;s ab&s;temious in that Article of Food. That &s;mall Society of indu&s;trious inoffen&s;ive People, who have lately &s;ettled in a neighbouring Province, and are commonly known by the Name of DUNKARDS, live for the mo&s;t Part upon Vegetable Pro|ductions; and tho' they do not refrain altogether from Meat, they profe&s;&s;edly u&s;e it very &s;paringly, from a Principle of Self-Denial. They are moreover very frugal in their Dre&s;s, Sleep upon Boards, and are extremely ho&s;pitable: They have a Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e of Wor&s;hip, and &s;ome Tenets peculiar to them&s;elves; and with Re&s;pect to their public OEconomy, they live under Regulations &s;omewhat re&s;embling the antient <HI>Spartans,</HI> or their modern Imita|tors the <HI>Moravians.</HI></P>
<P>This natural Aver&s;ion in Man to kill Animals for Food, if it did not give Ri&s;e to, was certainly much hightened by, the Be|lief of the METEMPSYCHOSIS, or TRANSMIGRATION of Souls; which PYTHAGORAS having been in&s;tructed in by the <HI>AEgyptian</HI> HIEROPHANTES, and BRAMINS of the Ea&s;t, is fal&s;ly &s;uppos'd to have been the Author of, becau&s;e he fir&s;t publicly taught it in <HI>Greece.</HI> For it is certain that all of this Per&s;ua&s;ion, ab&s;tain more or le&s;s from Animal Food; either from Motives of Religion, or Humanity.</P>
<P>As this Doctrine of the METEMPSYCHOSIS is very ancient, and con&s;titutes the very E&s;&s;ence of the <HI>Gentoo</HI> Religion at this Day; and as the Account of their original Tenets, lately pub|li&s;h'd by MR.

They believe that the Ho&s;t of Angels was called into Exi&s;tence long before the Creation of this World; and that long before this latter Event, there was an Apo&s;tacy or Rebellion of the Angels in Heaven, who, with their Chief, MOISASOOR, were bani&s;h'd thence by the ETERNAL ONE, into utter Darkne&s;s: That after &s;ome Time, at the Interce&s;&s;ion of the good Angels, &s;e|veral Worlds were created as Places of Puni&s;hment and Probation for &s;uch of the DEBTAH, or fallen Angels, as were penitent and de&s;irous of regaining their lo&s;t E&s;tate, where they were doom'd to animate the Bodies of different Animals, even to the &s;malle&s;t Rep|tile and Infect, according to the Nature and Degree of their Crimes; till by Obedience, Per&s;everance, and a Series of Tran&s;|migrations thro' different Species of Animals in all the&s;e &s;everal Worlds, they &s;hould have totally expiate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> their Guilt, and be again admitted into the DIVINE PRESENCE.

They believe that MOISASOOR, or the Arch Rebel, and his impe|nitent Followers, are continually endeavouring to bring back the Penitent Angels to their Apo&s;tacy, and to render ineffectual their Atonements, in the different Forms they animate: That the good Angels have al&s;o, from Time to Time, by the Permi&s;&s;ion of GOD, voluntarily &s;ubjected them&s;elves to the Feelings of <HI>Natural</HI> and <HI>Mo|ral Evil,</HI> and undergone the whole Series of Tran&s;migrations; for the Sake of in&s;tructing and encouraging their Penitent Bre|thren: That the&s;e <HI>benevolent Spirits</HI> have appear'd at different Pe|riods, in the various Characters of KINGS, LAWGIVERS, PHILO|SOPHERS, or TEACHERS; as &s;hining Examples to them of <HI>Courage, Piety, Benevolence,</HI> and of every other <HI>&s;ocial Virtue;</HI> and that the&s;e Vi&s;itations were more frequent formerly than now: That in all the inferior Orders of Beings, the&s;e Spirits are in a State of <HI>Puni&s;h|ment;</HI> but that in MAN, commences their State of <HI>Probation;</HI> be|cau&s;e in this Form only, they become ab&s;olute and free Agents: Whereas in other Forms, they believe that the intellectual Powers of the Criminal Spirits are circum&s;cribed, by the varied Structure of the Bodies they inhabit; and in this principally con&s;i&s;ts, &s;ay they, the Difference between MAN and other ANIMALS.

The Bramin DANDAMIS, tho' &s;ent for by ALEXANDER the GREAT to vi&s;it him, was equally unmoved by his Sollicitations and Threats; declaring that he had nothing to a&s;k of ALEXANDER, and that if the King had any Thing to a&s;k of him, he might come to him: This magnanimous Prince however conde&s;cended to vi&s;it him fir&s;t; after which the Philo&s;opher was prevailed upon to come to Court.

<P>When we con&s;ider the <HI>Primitive</HI> State of Man, according to the View already exhibited, we can not doubt that, being unaided by &s;upernatural Powers, unprompted by In&s;tinct, and without Expe|rience, he fir&s;t felt the Inconveniencies of his Situation, before he thought of the Means for Relief. His &s;low REASON mu&s;t often have been indebted to the more unerring INSTINCT of the Brute Creation, for the Election of his daily Food; and often, no Doubt, his late but woeful Experience taught him to di&s;tingui&s;h the noxious, from the whol&s;ome Vegetable, the nutritious and &s;alu|tary Fruit, from &s;uch as he had found to be deleterious or hurt|ful. Thus it is cu&s;tomary with Sailors, or &s;uch as are forced upon an uninhabited Coa&s;t, where they meet with unknown Fruits or Plants, to ob&s;erve with great Attention, &s;uch as are eat or ta&s;|ted by Birds or other Animals, before they them&s;elves venture to feed upon them.</P>
<P>But it may be pre&s;umed that their Acquaintance with, and Ob|&s;ervations upon the various Productions of the Earth, were not con|fined to &s;uch only as they u&s;ed for Food: They undoubtedly

made Trials of tho&s;e al&s;o that attracted their Notice by their Co|lour, Smell, or other &s;en&s;ible Qualities: From repeated Experi|ments of this Kind, they could not help ob&s;erving the powerful Effects of &s;ome of the&s;e Productions, in exciting and promoting the more obvious and grand Evacuations of the Body; and having perceived that whatever was hurtful or nau&s;eous to the Stomach, was ejected by <HI>Vomit;</HI> and that every Thing offen&s;ive to the Bow|els, was carried off by the <HI>foeculent</HI> Di&s;charges; it is rea&s;onable to conclude, that the mo&s;t efficacious Simples or Remedies for pro|moting the&s;e capital Evacuations, were carefully con&s;idered and di&s;tingui&s;hed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sic Medicinam ortam, &s;ubinde aliorum Salute, aliorum Interitu, pernicios a di&s;cernentem a Salutaribus.

<P>The SCIENCE of MEDICINE, in this its Dawning or Infancy, was u&s;ually with the other Learning of the Times, pre&s;erved by the <HI>Fathers</HI> or <HI>Heads</HI> of <HI>Families:</HI> But the Number of Ob&s;ervations and Remedies, becoming too great to be retained in the Memory of Men, otherwi&s;e occupied with the Concerns of their own little States or Tribes; and the Sacerdotal Function, for the like Rea|&s;ons of Convenience, being now &s;eparated from the temporal Au|thority, it was long engro&s;&s;ed by the <HI>Prie&s;ts;</HI> becau&s;e internal Di&s;|ea&s;es were then con&s;idered as Puni&s;hments immediately inflicted by the Gods, for Crimes; and were therefore to be cured &s;olely by prie&s;tly Arts and Invocations: And &s;uch is the State of Phy&s;ic a|mong &s;ome Super&s;titious and Pagan Nations, at this Day. After|wards, as Mankind advanced in the Knowledge of Nature, MEDICINE became the Study and Occupation of tho&s;e inqui&s;itive Geniu&s;es of Antiquity, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the Name of PHILOSOPHERS; who having more Lei&s;ure and Curio&s;ity to pro|&s;ecute Experiments, and to collect or mark down the Cures per|formed by them&s;elves, or communicated by others, became u&s;e|ful to Society, not more by their learned Di&s;qui&s;itions, than by vi&s;iting the Sick, and imparting their Advice to &s;uch as a&s;ked it: So that the &s;ame SAGES, who &s;o u&s;efully applied them&s;elves to the <HI>Study</HI> of <HI>Nature,</HI> were in their Day no le&s;s famous for the <HI>Cure</HI> of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> ut Morborum Curatio, &amp; Rerum Naturae Contemplatio &s;ub <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Autoribus nata fit.

Thus Remedies, handed down from Father to Son, were continually improved and mul|tiplied, by &s;ucceeding Generations.</P>
<P>The primitive Phy&s;icians mo&s;t probably began their Inquiries into the Nature of Di&s;ea&s;es, with tho&s;e which were mo&s;t generally ob&s;erved to attend upon the Changes of the Sea&s;ons: And as ASTRONOMY was the fir&s;t Science cultivated by the ancient Phi|lo&s;ophers, they would naturally impute the&s;e Di&s;tempers to the angry Influence of the Stars and Con&s;tellations, which were &s;up|po&s;ed to rule at &s;uch Sea&s;ons; hence aro&s;e a different Mode of treating Di&s;ea&s;es, by Charms and Incantations, in order to ap|pea&s;e the&s;e pre&s;iding Powers: The&s;e <HI>medical</HI> Charms continued long in U&s;e among the Antients, and are &s;till devoutly con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ided in, by many &s;uper&s;titious and ignorant Nations at this Day.</P>
<P>All the Progre&s;s made in the Art of Healing at, or before the Flood, may well be imagined to have been very incon&s;iderable. The infant State of the World makes it probable, that as ANIMAL FOOD and FERMENTED LIQUORS were then little u&s;ed, or altoge|ther unknown, there were but few Di&s;ea&s;es exi&s;ting; and that the Extent of Medical Skill then con&s;i&s;ted, in the &s;ucce&s;sful Exhibition of &s;ome <HI>Simples</HI> internally or externally u&s;ed; in <HI>Frictions, Bath|ing,</HI> and <HI>Sweating</HI> in the Sun or Sand. Immediately after that Pe|riod, the making of WINE was found out, and communicated to Mankind. This was probably the Effect of Accident; for NOAH had certainly ta&s;ted of the Grape, before he expre&s;&s;ed or fermented the Juice; and he could not po&s;&s;ibly know, that the Effects of Fer|mentation were to give an inebriating Quality, to a Liquor he had &s;o frequently experienced to be plea&s;ing and harmle&s;s, and to pro|duce a Spirit in the expre&s;&s;ed Juice, which it did not contain be|fore; till he di&s;covered it, by that memorable Incident recorded in Sacred Writ. Not long afterwards was probably di&s;covered the Me|thod of making of BEER; for HERODOTUS tell us, that in tho&s;e Provinces of <HI>Egypt</HI> where no Vines were cultivated, the People drank a Sort of Wine made of BARLEY: This &s;eems to have been the STRONG DRINK mentioned in &s;everal Places of the Old Te&s;tament, as di&s;tinct from <HI>Wine:</HI> Thus it is &s;aid, "<HI>Give</HI> STRONG DRINK <HI>to him that is ready to peri&s;h,</HI> and WINE <HI>to tho&s;e that be of heavy Hearts:&mdash;Thou &s;halt be&s;tow that Money for Oxen, or for Sheep, or for</HI> WINE, <HI>or for</HI> STRONG DRINK: AARON and his Sons were forbid to drink WINES, or STRONG DRINK, when they went into the Tabernacle of the Congregation, under the Penalty of Death: And MOSES tells the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> that in all
<PB N="19" REF="011338_0022_0F85807170098028">
their 40 Years Journey thro' the Wilderne&s;s, they neither drank WINE, nor STRONG DRINK: Which proves, that they were both at that Time known and u&s;ed, in the Country whence they had &s;o lately emigrated. The U&s;e of BEER among the <HI>Germans,</HI> and &s;ome other northern Nations, is as ancient as any Accounts we have of tho&s;e People, or their Cu&s;toms. DIOSCORIDES informs us, that the antient <HI>Britons</HI> u&s;ed an intoxicating <HI>Drink</HI> made of <HI>Barley,</HI> or &s;ometimes of <HI>Wheat,</HI> called in their Language CURMI; and this <HI>Liquor</HI> is &s;till highly celebrated in the old fe&s;tival Songs of the ancient <HI>Scots,</HI> by the &s;ame Name; tho' the Method of mak|ing it is now lo&s;t. This CURMI &s;eems to have been different in its Qualities, and in the Manner of preparing it, from any BEERS now known; if we may credit their Traditions concerning this famed BEVERAGE. We are told that the <HI>Mexicans</HI> al&s;o u&s;ed a BEER, or intoxicating Liquor made of MAIZ, or INDIAN CORN, when the <HI>Spaniards</HI> fir&s;t came among&s;t them: This mu&s;t have been an In|vention intirely their own. The &s;ame Fact is al&s;o told us of the <HI>Peruvians,</HI> in the Hi&s;tory of their <HI>Incas.</HI></P>
<P>As Vice and Debauchery, by &s;uch Means prevailed in the World, Infirmities and Di&s;ea&s;es mu&s;t have become more frequent; Remedies mu&s;t con&s;equently have been more &s;ought after, and valu|ed; and the Art it&s;elf more cultivated and e&s;teemed, as it became more u&s;eful or nece&s;&s;ary to Mankind.</P>
<P>We &s;hall now more particularly con&s;ider the STATE of PHY|SICK, among the mo&s;t celebrated Nations of Antiquity; and the Reputation it was held in by them, from the Times it began to be followed as a Profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>ASIA, without Doubt, was civilized before any other Part of the World. Accordingly we find that mo&s;t of the ARTS and SCIENCES, the &s;ure Concomitants and Con&s;equences of the E&s;ta|bli&s;hment of SOCIETIES, PROPERTY, and LAWS, had their fir&s;t Ri&s;e in the Ea&s;t. Here too were made the fir&s;t Ob&s;ervations upon Di&s;ea&s;es and Remedies, which were &s;oon communicated to <HI>Egypt;</HI> but it was in <HI>Egypt</HI> it&s;elf, that MEDICINE was fir&s;t followed as a SCIENCE. In <HI>Egypt</HI> it is to be ob&s;erved, that however the Hi&s;tory of their fir&s;t Kings has been concealed under Allegories and Fables, it is greatly for the Honour of this Profe&s;&s;ion, that of tho&s;e who have been deified by their &s;uper&s;titious Country-Men, for inventing or communicating u&s;eful Knowledge to Man|king; &s;ome as HERMES, OSYRIS, ISIS, and HORUS have been deified, more particularly for inventing and improving of PHY|SIC. It is in <HI>Egypt</HI> we have the fir&s;t authentick Account upon Record, of PHYSICIANS by Profe&s;&s;ion: For in the Book of <HI>Gene|&s;is</HI> we are told, that JOSEPH ordered the <HI>Phy&s;icians</HI> to embalm the Body of his Father JACOB. MEDICINE is &s;aid to have been fir&s;t reduced to a Sy&s;tem there, by THONIS; but after him, &s;everal

Kings are reported, not only to have &s;tudied, but al&s;o to have practi&s;ed it. The <HI>Egyptian</HI> Writer MANETHO, according to <HI>Eu&s;e|bius,</HI> relates that ATHOTIS wrote a Treati&s;e upon Anatomy; and HERMES, a King of <HI>Thebes,</HI> wrote upon the &s;ame Subject, for, adds our Author, <HI>he was a Phy&s;ician.&mdash;</HI> Whatever Credit may be given <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> tho&s;e Accounts, they at lea&s;t prove the great Anti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ity of the SCIENCE, as well as the great Veneration it was held in, at the Time when tho&s;e Authors wrote. Their <HI>Practice</HI> was much &s;ubdivided; for &s;ome undertook to cure one Di&s;temper only, and others to cure others: So<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> practi&s;ed only upon Di&s;ea&s;es of the HEAD; others only upon Di&s;ea&s;es of the EYES; of which la&s;t Cla&s;s, CYRUS &s;ent for one from <HI>Egypt.</HI> Others again practi&s;ed upon Di&s;ea&s;es of the BOWELS; &s;ome Studied tho&s;e Di&s;tempers incident to WOMEN only; others applied them&s;elves to cure OCCULT MALADIES incident to both Sexes: And none were allowed to practi&s;e out of their own Branch. The Profe&s;&s;ion a|mong them was hereditary, and the Science tran&s;mitted from Fa|ther to Son. They had Salaries and Mantainance allowed from the Public; and they practi&s;ed Gratis. The <HI>Egyptian</HI> Phy&s;icians were particularly &s;tudious of Cleanline&s;s. The Books containing their Rules and Method of <HI>Practice</HI> were depo&s;ited in their Tem|ples, along with tho&s;e of their Religion and Learning. If by fol|lowing the Directions of this their &s;acred <HI>Code,</HI> they could not cure or relieve the Patient, they were held blamele&s;s; but if they attempted any Thing not warranted by this <HI>Rule</HI> of <HI>Practice,</HI> and without Succe&s;s, it was deemed a capital Crime. None, under a &s;evere Penalty, was permitted to admini&s;ter Medicine, without being fir&s;t received a Member of their COLLEGE, and being <HI>li|cen&s;ed</HI> by their Authority. In all that Country, we are told, that MEDICINE was a favourite &s;tudy, and that they particularly re|vered the Profe&s;&s;ion and Character of a PHYSICIAN: Wherefore, as <HI>Egypt</HI> abounds with all Sorts of Plants, both Medicinal and Poi&s;onous, HOMER, after enumerating the plea&s;ing Effects of HELEN'S <HI>Anodyne Draught</HI> of NEPENTHE, communicated to her by POLYDAMNE, the Wife of THON Prince of CANOPUS, &s;ubjoins,

<P>It &s;hould be remarked here for the Honour of <HI>Egypt,</HI> that we have the fir&s;t Account of a PUBLIC LIBRARY, in that Coun|try; over the Doors of which was written, in golden Letters, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words">, or MEDICINE FOR THE SOUL.

<P>The PHAENICIANS are among the fir&s;t Nations that make any Figure in Hi&s;tory, for Learning and Arts; and who are &s;aid to have &s;tudied and cultivated <HI>phy&s;ic</HI> very early. But as we have only gene|ral A&s;&s;ertions to conduct us in our Inquiries here; and as all Ob&s;ervations upon Medicinal Facts, were in the&s;e Times nece&s;&s;a|rily interwoven with their other philo&s;ophic Studies; we are obliged to form our Opinions re&s;pecting their Skill in the HEALING ART, from the Advances we find they had made in the other Branches of USEFUL KNOWLEDGE. It is uncertain whence they derived their Origin. Some think that they were the Po&s;terity of the Inhabitants of <HI>Canaan,</HI> who e&s;caped the devouring Sword of the <HI>Jews;</HI> and this Opinion &s;eems countenanced by the Etymo|logy of the Word <HI>Canaan,</HI> which, in the Language of the Ea&s;t, means a <HI>Merchant.</HI> The AUTHOR of the <HI>Inquiry into the Life and Writings</HI> of HOMER ob&s;erves, That they retained much of the Manners of the Ea&s;tern Nations; that their Language was a Branch of the old <HI>Aramaean;</HI> that their Policy, both civil and reli|gious, their Temples, their Records pre&s;erved in Temples, and the Order of their Prie&s;ts exempted from Taxes, are very like the In&s;titutions that prevailed over the Ea&s;t: To which may be added, that the <HI>Tyrians</HI> wor&s;hipped the Fire. They were the Authors of the nobler Kinds of ARCHITECTURE, of NAVIGA|TION, and GEOGRAPHY; the Improvers of ASTRONOMY; the Inventors of the HELIOTROPE or <HI>Sun-Dial,</HI> and of GLASS; and the Rivals of the <HI>Egyptians</HI> for the Invention of LETTERS and ARITHMETICK. They were al&s;o the Parent of MECHANICS, and the fir&s;t Workers in <HI>Metals, Wood,</HI> and <HI>Stone:</HI> So that what is &s;aid of HIRAM, the <HI>Widow's Son</HI> from <HI>Tyre,</HI> and the Ma&s;ter Workman to King SOLOMON, was truly characteri&s;tic of the Nation,&mdash;<HI>he was &s;kilful to work in</HI> GOLD <HI>and in</HI> SILVER, <HI>in</HI> BRASS, <HI>in</HI> IRON, <HI>in</HI> STONE, <HI>and in</HI> TIMBER; <HI>in</HI> PURPLE, <HI>in</HI> BLUE, <HI>in fine</HI> LINNEN, <HI>and in</HI> CRIMSON: <HI>Al&s;o to grave every Manner of Grav|ing, and to find out every</HI> DEVICE <HI>which &s;hould be put to him.</HI> In &s;hort they excelled in all <HI>Works</HI> of <HI>Ta&s;te.</HI> By their frequent Voy|ages over the <HI>Euxine,</HI> and <HI>Red Seas</HI> to all the different Parts of the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> and into the <HI>Atlantic Ocean,</HI> as far as the <HI>Gum Coa&s;t</HI> on one Hand, and to <HI>Britain</HI> on the other; we may rea|&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e that they greatly improved the HEALING ART, and inriched the MATERIA MEDICA: For it is well known that the Communication of Di&s;ea&s;es from one Country to another, as well as of Remedies and Operations u&s;ed in different Countries for the &s;ame Di&s;ea&s;es, is the Effect of Commerce. From the <HI>Phaeni|cians,</HI> HOMER fir&s;t learned the noted Story of the SIRENS; and of that dangerous Dame <HI>Circe,</HI> who with the intoxicating Juice of Herbs, could transform Men into Brutes.

fir&s;t heard of the Inchantments of MEDEA in <HI>Colchis,</HI> and of her wonderful Skill in the Virtues of Herbs. If moreover we con&s;ider their daily Intercour&s;e with, and Vicinity to <HI>Egypt,</HI> where Medicine was always particularly cultivated and re&s;pected, and that even then, this <HI>Profe&s;&s;ion</HI> was a profitable Branch of Bu|&s;ine&s;s; we can not doubt that they, <HI>who&s;e Merchants were Princes, and who&s;e Tra&s;&s;ickers the Honourable of the Earth,</HI> were al&s;o well acquainted with the Nature and Cure of Di&s;ea&s;es.

<P><PB N="25" REF="011338_0028_0F8580756003F028">
The Doctrines of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> MAGI, are very ancient. Their Name, in that Language, means the &s;ame as PHILOSOPHERS among the <HI>Greeks,</HI> or SAPIENTES <HI>(Wi&s;emen)</HI> among the <HI>Latins;</HI> and from their extraordinary Learning, and Knowledge of the Operations of natural Bodies, they were believ'd to have &s;ecret Communication with, or Power over, <HI>invi&s;ible Spirits.</HI> We are told that they believed the <HI>Tran&s;migration of Souls;</HI> and DIOGE|NES LAERTIUS a&s;&s;ures us, that they lived intirely upon Milk and Vegetables. They were the &s;ole Guardians and Superintendants of RELIGION, and of the LAWS: No publick Wor&s;hip could be perform'd but by them; and no Law could be enacted or abrogated without their Concurrence. They allowed of no <HI>Images,</HI> nor u&s;ed <HI>bloody Sacrifices</HI> in their Wor&s;hip; which was always in an|cient Times, perform'd by them in the open Air, or in Groves, but never in covered Temples: For as the SUN was the great Object of their Adoration, they &s;aid that the whole World was the <HI>Temple</HI> of the SUN. However, Temples were afterwards per|mitted, for the Pre&s;ervation of their <HI>Holy Fire,</HI> which was always kept burning; tho' even then their Temples were open at the Top. Their Doctrines are believed to be older than ZOROASTER, and he lived about the Time of ROMULUS. They were equally revered by Princes and People; and &s;eem'd to have had the &s;ame Power and Influence, as the PROPHETS among the <HI>Jews.</HI> They were famed for their Knowledge in the Arts of <HI>Divination</HI> and <HI>Au|gury;</HI> and made great U&s;e of <HI>Charms.</HI> The Scripture bears Te&s;ti|mony of their Skill in <HI>A&s;tronomy,</HI> by the Ob&s;ervations they made upon that STAR which appeared at the Birth of CHRIST. The Po&s;terity of the&s;e MAGI are &s;till extant in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies;</HI> and are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the Name of PARSSES. They call them&s;elves FOLLOWERS of ZOROASTER; and have pre&s;erved the Religion and Belief of the ancient MAGI, with little Alteration, to this Day. We are indebted to the Indu&s;try and laudable Curio&s;ity of MR. DU PERRON, for the be&s;t and mo&s;t genuine Account we have, of the Rites and Opinions of the&s;e PARSSES. This Gentleman, a few Years ago, voluntarily undertook a Voyage to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> in order to learn the <HI>Language</HI> and <HI>Religion</HI> of the PARSSES, from the PARSSES them&s;elves; and to di&s;cover and tran&s;late at the Fountain Head, the ZENDOVESTA, or <HI>Writings</HI> generally attributed to ZO|ROASTER. After travelling &s;ome Time over <HI>Indo&s;tan,</HI> for Informa|tion, and in Order to collect Materials, he fixed his Re&s;idence at <HI>Surat,</HI> where he continued three Years, &s;tudying tho&s;e Langua|ges in which their <HI>Sacred Books</HI> are written, and which are now no more &s;poken or under&s;tood, except by a few of their LEARNED. At <HI>Surat</HI> he purcha&s;ed a great many of their Original <HI>Manu&s;cripts,</HI> which he partly copied, and partly tran&s;lated. Here too he had an Opportunity of conver&s;ing with their <HI>Doctors,</HI> or <HI>Teachers;</HI> as there is a large Body of the&s;e PARSSES, who have been e&s;tabli&s;hed

The&s;e&punc; original <HI>Manu|&s;cripts,</HI> with Copies and Tran&s;lations of &s;everal others, re&s;pecting both the Religion of the PARSSES and BRAMINS, and which were collected from different Parts of <HI>India,</HI> have been brought to <HI>France,</HI> and depo&s;ited by DU PERRON in the <HI>King'</HI>s <HI>Library</HI> there: The Genuine&s;s of which is &s;upported, by the univer&s;al Belief of the People them&s;elves, and of the Country they re&s;ide in; by an unin|terrupted Tradition down from ZOROASTER him&s;elf; by the evident Antiquity of the <HI>Character</HI> and <HI>Languages</HI> in which they are written, and which are now no longer u&s;ed, and almo&s;t in|tirely forgot; and by the A&s;&s;ent of the <HI>Mahometans</HI> them&s;elves, their declared Enemies. Tho' their Laws and Opinions are allowed to be much older than ZOROASTER, yet as he new modelled and reduced them to a regular Sy&s;tem, he is con&s;idered by them, not only as having been their PRINCE and LAWGIVER, but al&s;o as an i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;pired PROPHET and PHILOSOPHER: His Body of Laws is divided into 21 Books, &s;ome of which are now lo&s;t; 7 of them treated of the <HI>Creation,</HI> and <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> of the <HI>World;</HI> 7 of <HI>Morality,</HI> and of all <HI>Duties civil</HI> and <HI>religious;</HI> and 7, of PHYSICK and <HI>A&s;tro|nomy.</HI> In one of his Chapters, he treats particularly of the DIG|NITY and USEFULNESS of the MEDICAL PROFESSION; and of the great Merit of him who has cured many Sick&punc; promi&s;ing that he &s;hall be rewarded with a long and happy Life. He forbids them u&s;ing Remedies to his beloved PARSSES, without having fir&s;t ex|perienced their Efficacy on others: And he then fixes the <HI>Fees,</HI> which the different Cla&s;&s;es among the PARSSES are to give to the PHYSI|CIAN. He al&s;o treats, in different Places, of &s;everal Di&s;orders incident to Women, under various Circum&s;tance<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Life. Whence we may rea&s;onably conclude, that before ZOROASTER compo&s;ed his ZENDOVESTA, the SCIENCE of PHYSICK, mu&s;t have been for &s;ome Time followed as a learned and re&s;pectable Profe&s;&s;ion, either in his own Country, or in <HI>Indo&s;tan,</HI> the Place of his Travels and Studies; or in both. Our Author was often in the Temples of the PARSSES, and ob&s;erved their Mode of wor&s;hipping the <HI>Holy Fire&punc;</HI> according to the U&s;ages of the Ancient MAGI.

The PARSSES are forbidden to &s;wear, even in Favour of the Truth. They believe that there are two primary and powerful Angels; the one the Author of all Good, called MYTHRAS; and the other the Author of all Evil, called ARIMANIUS; who are for ever at Variance: But that both are &s;ubject to one uncreated Supreme RULER of the <HI>Univer&s;e,</HI> by them called OROMAZES.</P>
<P>The GREEKS derived almo&s;t all their <HI>Theology,</HI> and the great|e&s;t Part of their other Learning from the <HI>AEgyptians,</HI> and <HI>A&s;iaticks:</HI> And as the Travellers of both Nations frequently took <HI>Phaenicia</HI> in their Way, the <HI>AEgyptian Doctrines,</HI> and <HI>Phaenician Arts,</HI> pa&s;&s;ed into <HI>Greece</HI> about the &s;ame Time: Thus DANAUS the <HI>AEgyptian,</HI> the <HI>Phrygian</HI> PELOPS, and CADMUS the <HI>Phaenician,</HI> tho' by De|&s;cent an <HI>AEgyptian,</HI> are acknowledged to have been the fir&s;t Plan|ters and Improvers o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Greece.</HI> By CADMUS particularly, the <HI>Greeks</HI> were fir&s;t taught the U&s;e of <HI>Letters,</HI> and the My&s;teries of the CA|BEIRI, or <HI>Great Gods.</HI> In <HI>Crete,</HI> a Colony from <HI>AEgypt,</HI> they learned the In&s;titution of ORACLES; with the other nece&s;&s;ary &s;ub&s;ervient <HI>Arts.</HI> The STUDY of MEDICINE was as early cul|tivated in <HI>Greece,</HI> as any other Branch of <HI>Science</HI> whatever.</P>
<P>Before the <HI>Trojan War,</HI> MELAMPUS, already mentioned, cured the Daughters of PRAETUS King of <HI>Argos,</HI> of a particular Spe|cies of Madne&s;s or <HI>Hy&s;terick Phren&s;y;</HI> for which he was rewarded with one of them in Marriage, and a third Part of the Kingdom as her Portion: He is al&s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e fir&s;t who pre&s;cribed the <HI>Cold Bath</HI> as a MEDICINE; by Means of which, and other Pre&s;criptions&punc; he cured IPHICLUS of <HI>Impotency.</HI> MEDFA, &s;o celebrated in the Ex|pedition of the ARGONAUTS to <HI>Colchis,</HI> fir&s;t invented the <HI>Medi|cated Warm</HI> BATH; which was attended with &s;uch &s;alutary Effects, that &s;he was feigned, not only to have thereby re&s;tored her Hu&s;|band JASON's Father, the aged AESON, to Youth; but al&s;o to have pre&s;erved by the &s;ame Means, an unfaded Youth in her&s;elf.

<P>Tho' the <HI>Greek</HI> Poet, here in the Original,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">O'<GAP DESC="foreign"></NOTE> pa&s;&s;es a very &s;ignal Commendation upon PHYSICIANS, and in&s;inuates that the <HI>Grecian</HI> Army was not &s;o much di&s;pirited at the Wounds of their brave&s;t Heroes, as at the &s;ingle Danger of MACHAON, whom in another Place he calls the <HI>Pre&s;erver</HI> of the <HI>Greeks,</HI> yet it mu&s;t be owned that POPE, probably in Gratitude to his learned Friend and Phy&s;ician DOCTOR ARBUTHNOT, has very much heightened the Compliment in his Tran&s;lation.

<P>And the Di&s;tre&s;s of the bleeding EURYPYLUS is greatly aggra|vated with this Reflection, that

<P>BOTANY, or the Knowledge of Plants, mu&s;t even then have been in the highe&s;t Repute among&s;t them; and they believed that the mo&s;t wonderful and &s;upernatural <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ffects, could be produced by Means of Herbs: The Stories of MEDEA and CIRCE are well known; and HOMER in the <HI>Iliad</HI> di&s;tingui&s;hes AGAMEDE by this Character;

as a Reward for his Skill and Services. This is the fir&s;t In&s;tance on Record of <HI>Venoe&s;ection,</HI> or Bleeding with a medicinal Intention.</P>
<P>The <HI>Greeks</HI> in early Times imitated the <HI>Babylonians</HI> and <HI>Egypti|ans,</HI> in bringing their Sick into the mo&s;t public Places, for Ad|vice. They carried them &s;ometimes too into their Temples, to be there directed to a Cure, by the &s;uppo&s;ed Influence of their Deities in Dreams, or by the Management and Attendance of their Prie&s;ts or Devotees who came to wor&s;hip: And when a Cure was effected, the Hi&s;tory of the Ca&s;e, and the particular Method of Treatment by which the Sick recovered, were engraved o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> written upon Tables, and hung up again&s;t the Walls and Pillars of the Temple; both as a Memorial of the Patients Gratitude; and to in&s;truct others, who might thereafter labour under the &s;ame Com|plaints.

<P>Many <HI>Medical Schools</HI> were erected at different Times in <HI>Greece,</HI> and al&s;o by her Colonies, in various Parts of the World. From that of <HI>Crotone,</HI> the celebrated DAMOCEDES, had the good Fortune to cure DARIUS King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> of an ob&s;tinate Di&s;order&punc; which had baffled the Endeavours of his own Phy&s;icians; for which he was loaded by that Prince with great Wealth and Honors, and was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed ever afterwards of his Confidence and Friend&s;hip. But that of <HI>Coos</HI> excelled all others in Fame, by giving to the World the immortal HIPPOCRATES; who&s;e Reputation was &s;o great, that not only his own Countrymen, the <HI>Coans,</HI> impre&s;&s;ed&punc; his Image upon their public Coins; but all <HI>Greece,</HI> by common Suffrage decreed him the &s;ame Honours as were paid to <HI>Hercules.</HI> The <HI>Athenians,</HI> the polite&s;t and mo&s;t learned of all the <HI>Graecian</HI> States, made him free of their City, voted him a Crown of Gold, and Maintenance to him and his Po&s;terity, at the public Expence. And in &s;uch Repute was the Profe&s;&s;ion in his Time, that, when taught to a Pupil, a more than filial Gratitude and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">rpetual Obedience were required from him to his Ma&s;ter or Teacher; ina&s;much as his Birth or Initiation into tho&s;e learned and u&s;eful My&s;teries, was thought of &s;uperior Import to that of Nature: The <HI>Oath</HI> exacted by HIPPOCRATES from his Pupils, is a Proof of this; and has &s;erved as a Model for tho&s;e &s;olemn Obligations u&s;ually admini&s;tred to GRADUATES in <HI>Medicine,</HI> in all regular <HI>Univer&s;ities,</HI> ever &s;ince. The <HI>Athenians</HI> held the HEALING ART of &s;uch Con&s;equence to the Public, that they pa&s;&s;ed a Law forbid|ding all Women, and &s;uch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> were not free, to learn any Part of <HI>Medicine;</HI> and not only they, but &s;everal other <HI>Grecian</HI> States

al&s;o decreed public Honours and di&s;tingui&s;hed Privileges to PHYSICIANS.</P>
<P>Thus we find the greate&s;t PHILOSOPHERS of Antiquity, were proud of the Name and Reputation of being &s;killed in Medicine. PYTHAGORAS, who has been already mentioned, erected a Medi|cal School in <HI>Italy,</HI> 550 Years before CHRIST; and both he, and DEMOCRITUS wrote upon the Virtues of Herbs. The divine PLATO wrote upon the <HI>Theory</HI> of <HI>Medicine,</HI> and particularly <HI>Phy|&s;iology,</HI> or the OEconomy of the human Body. ARISTOTLE being de&s;cended from AESCULAPIUS, con&s;idered the SCIENCE as his Birth-right; he therefore not only &s;tudied, but practi&s;ed it with &s;uch Succe&s;s, that having recovered his Pupil the great ALEX|ANDER from a Pit of Sickne&s;s, this Monarch, ever ambitious of excelling, prevailed with his Matter to in&s;truct him too in that u&s;eful SCIENCE; and which PLUTARCH tells us, the King after|wards thought not unbecoming his Dignity to communicate to others: When this Prince was &s;ick at <HI>Tar&s;us,</HI> in Con&s;equence of un&s;ea&s;onably bathing in the River <HI>Cydnus,</HI> the noble and gene|rous Confidence with which he treated his Phy&s;ician PHILIP, not|with&s;tanding he had received Notice from PARMENIO to beware of him as a Traitor, is not more a Proof of his own Magnani|mity, than of the high Opinion he entertained of his Phy&s;icians Skill and Integrity. ALEXANDER's Situation here was critical, him&s;elf unable to act; DARIUS advancing fa&s;t upon him; being therefore equally impatient of Doubts as of Delay, he pre&s;ented PARMENIO's Letter with one Hand to PHILIP, while with the other he took down the medicated Potion prepared for him: Nor was he deceived in the Event. THEOPHRASTUS al&s;o, and many other <HI>Philo&s;ophers</HI> of Antiquity, both practi&s;ed and wrote upon <HI>Phy&s;ick.</HI> At <HI>Smyrna,</HI> another <HI>Graecian</HI> Colony in the le&s;&s;er <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> PHYSICIANS were held in &s;uch Repute and public E&s;timation, that, as we are informed by the learned DOCTOR MEAD, their Names were impre&s;&s;ed upon their public Coins, with tho&s;e of their <HI>Praetors</HI> or chief Magi&s;trates; they were even frequently joined in their Medals, with their tutelar Deities: Nor did they confine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Honours to their <HI>own Phy&s;icians;</HI> for we know, from the &s;ame Authority, that they be&s;tow'd them al&s;o upon o|thers eminent in this Profe&s;&s;ion; tho' belonging to another cele|brated <HI>School</HI> in a remote Country, and at that Time their Ri|val in medical Fame.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the medical Abilities of the <HI>Greeks</HI> continued une|qualled, during the whole Cour&s;e of the <HI>Roman</HI> Sovereignty; and even after its Declen&s;ion: And the learned FREIND ob&s;erves, that if we compare any of the <HI>Greek</HI> medical Writers, from HIP|POCRATES to PAULUS AEGINETA of the 7th Century, with the very be&s;t of their Cotemporaries in any Art or Profe&s;&s;ion what|ever,

we &s;hall find them not at all inferior, either in the Di&s;po|&s;ition of their Matter, the Clearne&s;s of their Rea&s;oning, or the Propriety of their Language. Some have written above the Standard of the Age they lived in; and many have done great Honour to this Profe&s;&s;ion, by their exten&s;ive Knowledge in other Arts and Sciences, as well as their own. The Integrity of the Ancients was &s;uch, that altho' their Credulity was &s;ometimes an Impeachment to their Under&s;tandings, yet, being above the little Views of private Intere&s;t, and acting up to the Character of their Profe&s;&s;ion; whatever they could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> out by their own Experience, or from the Ob&s;ervations of others, which might relieve their Fellow Creatures, they candidly and generou&s;ly made it public. This was the Practice of the Antients, and ought to be a perpe|tual Model for &s;uch of their Succe&s;&s;ors, as would imitate them, either in their Knowledge, or their Virtues. Their medical Writ|ings were evidently the Re&s;ult of long Practice, accurate Ob&s;er|vation, and &s;olid judgement. Hence an univer&s;al and de&s;erved Deference is paid to their A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">thority, by every Practitioner, who de&s;ires to comprehend the whole Circle of this Science, or to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf by Abilities in his Profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The CARTHAGINIANS were a Colony of the <HI>Phaenicians;</HI> and as there was an uninterrupted Amity and Corre&s;pondence kept up between the&s;e Republicks, while either could be of U&s;e to the other, we cannot doubt that they were well acquainted with all the Learning and Arts of the Country they came from. They had al&s;o frequent Intercour&s;e with the <HI>Greeks,</HI> while at the Sum|mit of their Glory for Arts and Arms; and while MEDICINE was both a fa&s;hionable Part of Philo&s;ophy, and followed as a Profe&s;&s;ion: For we find that their <HI>Lacedemon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">an</HI> Allies under XANTIPPUS, defeated the <HI>Roman</HI> Con&s;ul REGULUS in <HI>Africa,</HI> and took him Pri&s;oner, 499 Years after the Building of <HI>Rome,</HI> and 255 Years before CHRIST; whereas HIPPOCRATES lived about 500 Years before this la&s;t Event. What Progre&s;s the <HI>Carthaginians</HI> them&s;elves had made in the HEALING ART, cannot now be a&s;|certained; by Rea&s;on of the barbarous Policy of the <HI>Romans,</HI> in de&s;troying their hi&s;torical Monuments and Records. We know, however, that there was a Temple in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> Part of <HI>Carthage</HI> cal|led <HI>Byr&s;a,</HI> dedicated to ESCULAPIUS; and DIODORUS SICULUS, in his Account of the Plague which raged among&s;t the Troops under HAMILCO, at the Siege of <HI>Syracu&s;e,</HI> gives us to under&s;tand, that they had at that Time profe&s;&s;ed PHYSICIANS in their Army.</P>
<P>The ROMANS are the only Nation of Antiquity who enjoy'd a Form of Government, for &s;everal Centuries, without any Know|ledge of MEDICINE. This is the more &s;urprizing, as they appear from their Origin to have been a re&s;tle&s;s, quarrel&s;ome People, perpetually embroiled in bloody Di&s;&s;en&s;ions at Home, or in cruel

Wars abroad; when the <HI>Healing Art,</HI> particularly CHIRURGEY, mu&s;t have been extremely nece&s;&s;ary. In the 350th Year of their City, there was certainly no Practitioner, at lea&s;t of Merit, a|mong&s;t them; for being them grievou&s;ly afflicted with the Plague, they, by the Advice of the Oracle at <HI>Delphi,</HI> &s;ent ten Deputies to the Temple of AESCULAPIUS at <HI>Epidaurus,</HI> to bring the God to <HI>Rome.</HI> His God&s;hip, as we are told, was plea&s;ed to go along with them, in the Shape of a Serpent; and having quitted the Ve&s;&s;el and gone a&s;hore on an I&s;land in the <HI>Tyber,</HI> near the City, a Temple was there erected to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> upon which the Plague cea&s;ed. Hither the Sick from all Parts of <HI>Italy</HI> re&s;orted, or &s;ent for Relief. The Method of recording Cures, according to the Cu&s;tom of the <HI>Greeks,</HI> was long practi&s;ed here too, as PLINY te&s;tifies: And HIERONYMUS MERCURIALIS has pre&s;erved to us &s;ome In&s;crip|tions written in the Reign of ANTONINUS, and found in this Temple of ESCULAPIUS; where not only the Cures effected, but al&s;o the Remedies pre&s;cribed by the Oracle are recorded. In the Ruins of this Temple, not long ago, was di&s;covered one of the Marble Tables which had been con&s;ecrated to this Deity; upon which are ingraved in Greek Characters, &s;everal Cures performed by his Advice; and which is &s;till pre&s;erved as a great Curio&s;ity, in the Palace of MAPHEO at <HI>Rome.</HI> 'Tis indeed allow'd that, for nearly the fir&s;t five hundred Years of their City, few or no Ve&s;tiges of any Kind of polite Literature, are to be found among&s;t them. Before this Period, they &s;eem to have re&s;embled rather a turbulent, licentious, and ill a&s;&s;ociated Community, with re&s;pect to them|&s;elves; and a vindictive, haughty, and unrelenting Band of De|&s;troyers, with re&s;pect to the neighbouring Nations; than the Pro|genitors of tho&s;e, who were one Day to give Law to, and diffu&s;e the Polite Arts with new Lu&s;tre over the World. The Accounts of their Tran&s;actions, as related by their own Hi&s;torians, &s;uffi|ciently countenance this Opinion; which might probably have been the general Belief at this Day concerning them, if their rival States had been equally fortunate, in tran&s;mitting to us their own Hi&s;tories, together with their Sentiments and Portrait, of the Policy, and leading Characters of that imperious and proud Republic; &s;o as that Po&s;terity, unbia&s;&s;ed by partial Evidence, might have judged for them&s;elves&punc; However, we are a&s;&s;ured that this SCI|ENCE was encouraged, as early as any Kind of Learning was taught among&s;t them: For about, or a few Years after the <HI>AEra</HI> abovementioned, we have an Account of one ARCHAGATHUS, a <HI>Phy&s;ician</HI> of great Reputation, who came from <HI>Greece</HI> to <HI>Rome;</HI> where he was honoured with the Freedom of the City, and a Hou&s;e given him to dwell in. Some Time after him, lived ASCLEPIADES the <HI>Bithynian,</HI> Phy&s;ician to CRASSUS; no le&s;s re&s;pec|ted by the Great for his Eloquence, than for his Skill in PHYSIC. It is very remarkable, that from the fir&s;t Introduction of public Schools at <HI>Rome,</HI> to the Subver&s;ion of this unweildly and corrup|ted

Republic, by the &s;uperior Fortunes of the great CAESAR, almo&s;t every Profe&s;&s;ion or Art then &s;tudied or practi&s;ed among&s;t them, except that of War, was chiefly taught by &s;uch <HI>Greeks,</HI> as had emigrated thither for the Sake of Curio&s;ity or Gain; or by &s;uch as the Fate of Arms had reduced to Servitude: For the fierce and warlike Temper of her own Citizens, unlike the more exten|&s;ive and elevated Genius of the <HI>Greeks,</HI> deigned not as yet to profe&s;s any Science, except &s;uch as tended to gratify their Ambi|tion for Conque&s;t, or to lead and rule the People. While the <HI>Romans</HI> thus had little other Knowledge of PHYSIC, than what was practi&s;ed by Captives and Foreigners, or &s;erved only to en|hance the Price of a Slave, we cannot wonder that it &s;hould &s;ome|times be &s;poke of by their Learned, in very inadequate Terms: VIRGIL at one Time &s;eems to con&s;ider it as a mere manual Occupation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mutas agitare, inglorius, Artes.</NOTE>; yet this great POET tells us, that his Hero's <HI>Phy&s;ician</HI> JAPIS, preferred the Knowledge of <HI>Medicine,</HI> to that of <HI>Divination, Archery,</HI> or <HI>Mu&s;ic;</HI> all which APOLLO had put equally in his Election<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">&mdash;Scire Pote&s;tates Herbarum, u&s;umque medendi Maluit.

AUGUSTUS confirm'd to them the&s;e Honours; and particularly indulged his own Phy&s;ician, ANTO|NIUS MUSA, the Privilege of wearing a golden Ring, which among them was the u&s;ual Badge of <HI>Knight-hood.</HI> To this MUSA the <HI>Romans</HI> al&s;o erected a brazen Statue, as a grateful Acknow|ledgment of his Services and Skill, in curing AUGUSTUS of an ob&s;tinate Di&s;order.

<P>VALENTINIAN ordained that there &s;hould be a PHYSICIAN for each of the 14 Wards into which <HI>Rome</HI> was divided, to take Care of the Poor; and who &s;hould be paid at the Public Expence.

public Benefactions in the Places where they lived; and la&s;tly, that many, from the Reputation of their univer&s;al Learning and great Abilities, were employed as Emba&s;&s;adors to foreign Poten|tates, and in the other highe&s;t Offices of State. But be&s;ides the many and di&s;tingui&s;h'd Honours and Privileges from Time to Time conferred upon Individuals, the whole Profe&s;&s;ion was held in &s;uch E&s;teem, that great Immunities were al&s;o granted to their <HI>Schools</HI> or COLLEGES, as well as to them&s;elves. They were by the public Edicts of ANTONINUS, CONSTANTINE the GREAT, and JULIAN, exempted from all the u&s;ual Duties of Citizens, or Sol|diers, from attending Courts, or entertaining public Officers and Strangers; and every one was forbid to mole&s;t them, under the Penalty of being puni&s;hed at the Will of the Judge: And a Parti|cipation of the&s;e public Indulgences was extended, even to the Wives and Children of &s;uch u&s;eful Members to the Common-Weal. Nor was the Fame of their PPYSICIANS always confined to the Li|mits even of this va&s;t Empire; for when a Peace was negotiating between the Emperor JUSTINIAN, and CHOSROES King of <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> this la&s;t would not even agree to a Truce, but upon this expre&s;s Condition, that the <HI>Phy&s;ician</HI> TRIBUNUS, who&s;e A&s;&s;i&s;tance he wanted, and who&s;e Skill he was acquainted with, &s;hould be &s;ent to him; which JUSTINIAN having comply'd with, a Truce was granted for 5 Years. CHOSROES, being re&s;tored to Health by the Care of TRIBUNUS, offered to give him whatever he de|manded: But the generous Phy&s;ician only de&s;ired that &s;ome <HI>Roman</HI> Captives, his Countrymen, &s;hould be &s;et at Liberty: That gallant PRINCE not only relea&s;ed the Per&s;ons required, and 3000 Pri&s;oners be&s;ides, but al&s;o rewarded him with great Pre&s;ents; and &s;ent him back in Safety to his own Country.</P>
<P>About this Time the MEDICAL SCHOOL of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> was &s;o celebrated thro' the learned World, that to have been educated there, was alone &s;ufficient to give the Reputation of great Skill in PHYSIC. The Fame of this Place for MEDICINE, had been long before this <HI>AE<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a</HI> e&s;tabli&s;h'd in the Ea&s;t; and it continu'd undimi|ni&s;hed for many Years, even after the City had been, in the 7th Century, &s;acked by the <HI>Saracens.</HI> HEROPHILUS, Phy&s;ician to PTO|LOMY LATHYRUS, is &s;aid to have been the Founder, as well as the great Ornament of this School: He is &s;aid al&s;o to have been the fir&s;t who di&s;&s;ected Human Bodies, for the Purpo&s;es of Medical In|&s;truction; by the Countenance and Encouragement of that Prince.</P>

As
<PB N="35" REF="011338_0038_0F85808333A67538">
the&s;e Men, be&s;ides their other Functions, were al&s;o in their Day, the &s;ole <HI>Practitioners</HI> of PHYSIC; and from Circum&s;tances of Place, &s;eem to hold &s;ome di&s;tant Connection with our&s;elves; I hope I &s;hall be indulged in being &s;omewhat particular in the following Account of them: As indeed the Advances made by them in the other Branches of Literature, are the only Rule we have, whereby to judge of their Progre&s;s in MEDICINE.</P>
<P>The DRUIDS, by &s;ome called SEMNOTHEANS, <HI>i. e.</HI> &s;uch as <HI>reverence the</HI> GODS, were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;ame Influence and Au|thority among the <HI>Celtes,</HI> and other <HI>Gallic</HI> Tribes, as the <HI>Per&s;ian Magi;</HI> or as the <HI>Prophets</HI> among the JEWS; who are well known to have been often too powerful, for Royalty it&s;elf. The fir&s;t Account we have of them by that Name, is from CAESAR, who in his Com|mentaries de&s;cribes them as a COLLEGE, or &s;elect Cla&s;s of religious <HI>Philo&s;ophers,</HI> and <HI>Prie&s;ts,</HI> having fix'd Places of Wor&s;hip; as govern|ed by particular and e&s;tabli&s;hed Regulations, and &s;ubjected to one certain Head or ARCHDRUID, who re&s;ided in <HI>Britain:</HI> To which Place, he &s;ays, all the Noble Youth of the Continental <HI>Gauls,</HI> were u&s;ually &s;ent for their Education. As they knew not the U&s;e of Let|ters, before their Intercour&s;e with the <HI>Romans,</HI> they committed all their Learning to Memory, and delivered it to their Pupils in Ver&s;e. They were &s;o called from DERU, which in the old <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Language &s;ignifies an OAK; becau&s;e the OAK was always held &s;a|cred by them; becau&s;e they always wor&s;hiped in Groves of OAK, upon gently elevated Places; and becau&s;e they never perform'd any of their religious Functions without it. The MISLETOE of the OAK was in a particular Manner revered by them, and gathered at cer|tain Sea&s;ons, with great Parade and Ceremony: They believed this to be an infallible Cure for Barrenne&s;s; an Antidote to Poi|&s;ons; a Pre&s;ervative again&s;t Witchcraft; and a powerful Remedy in all Di&s;ea&s;es whatever. In &s;ome old <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Books &s;till extant, are to be found many of the <HI>Medical Secrets,</HI> u&s;ually practi&s;ed by the DRUIDS, in their Treatment of various Maladies; and it need not be doubted, that many of the &s;trange Cures and Charms re|commended at this Day, for different Complaints, by the com|mon People of the HEBRIDES or <HI>We&s;tern I&s;lands,</HI> and el&s;ewhere in <HI>Britain,</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> are from the &s;ame Origin. They were ex|perienced in the Powers of <HI>natural Bodies,</HI> and particularly in the Properties of <HI>Plants,</HI> and gave great Application to &s;uch Studies; whence they were con&s;tantly con&s;ulted in all bodily Infirmities and Sickne&s;s, by all Ranks of People: The SILAGO, a Species of <HI>Mo&s;s</HI> which grows upon Trees, was al&s;o a &s;overeign Remedy with them, e&s;pecially for Di&s;ea&s;es of the Eyes; as was al&s;o the <HI>Sa|molus,</HI> a Species of the <HI>Water-Brook-Lime.</HI> They were much ad|dicted to <HI>Magick, Incantations,</HI> and <HI>Charms;</HI> and were highly e&s;teem'd, even by the Romans, for their Skill in <HI>Divination</HI> and <HI>Augury.</HI> They were great <HI>A&s;tronomers,</HI> and 'tis &s;aid, could cal|culate
<PB N="36" REF="011338_0039_0F858083ABD37B80">
Eclip&s;es. They were indeed well ver&s;ed in all tho&s;e Arts, by which the Terror and Amazement of the Vulgar are u&s;ually excited; and by which the beneficial Belief, of their being po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of Supernatural Powers, could be kept up. The <HI>Learned</HI> have found much Re&s;emblance between the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> DRUIDS, and the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> MAGI, in their religious Te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ets, Modes of Wor&s;hip, Learning, and Dre&s;s. The DRUIDS acknowledged the Exi&s;tence of one Supreme God, uncreated, and unconfined; whom they therefore adored in the open Air, in con&s;ecrated Groves, but never in covered Temples. They admitted however of inferior Deities: Thus, TARANUS was their <HI>Jupiter,</HI> having Power over the Heavens: HAESUS was their <HI>Mars,</HI> or God of War: TEU|TATES was their <HI>Mercury,</HI> who pre&s;ided over Arts and Com|merc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e, and was the Guide of Travellers. But their principal Adoration was directed to APOLLO, or the SUN; as the God of <HI>Light, Heat,</HI> and PHYSIC. To the SUN they offered grand year|ly Sacrifices on the fir&s;t Day of <HI>May;</HI> at which Time all dome&s;|tic Fires were every where extingui&s;hed, and the People went to receive holy Fire from the DRUIDS, at their Temples, or Places of Wor&s;hip; to rekindle their hou&s;ehold Fires. This Deity or God-like Luminary, was by the DRUIDS of <HI>S. Britain,</HI> called BELIN; and the principal Seat of his Wor&s;hip, was in the I&s;le of <HI>Angle&s;ey:</HI> But the <HI>Caledonian</HI> DRUIDS gave him the Name of GRIAN, &s;ignifying the <HI>E&s;&s;ence,</HI> or <HI>Source</HI> of <HI>Fire</HI> and <HI>Heat;</HI> and wor&s;hipped him at particular Sea&s;ons, by making large Fires up|on the Tops of Hills. There are many Remains of the <HI>Druidical</HI> Temples, &s;till to be &s;een in <HI>Angle&s;ey,</HI> in the <HI>We&s;tern I&s;les</HI> of <HI>Scot|land,</HI> and in &s;everal other Places; con&s;i&s;ting of long, large, and rude &s;ingle Stones placed on End in the Ground, at regular Di&s;|tances, and in a circular Form; with an Avenue of the &s;ame Contrivance, leading up to it. They al&s;o paid great Veneration to the MOON; who&s;e Temples were con&s;tructed in like Manner, but of a &s;emicircular Form; as appears by the Ve&s;tiges of &s;ome of them, &s;till ob&s;ervable in the North of <HI>Scotland.</HI> Mu&s;ic, both Vocal and In&s;trumental, was a con&s;tant Attendant upon all their religious Rites; and their In&s;truments were <HI>Pipes, Flutes,</HI> and <HI>Harps.</HI> It does not appear that they ever u&s;ed any Images in their Wor&s;hip: From which and other Circum&s;tances, it &s;eems evi|dent, that they borrow'd nothing from the <HI>Greeks;</HI> tho' it may be rea&s;onably &s;u&s;pected, that the <HI>Greeks</HI> have been indebted for &s;ome things to the DRUIDS. Their Authority was &s;o great, and &s;o devoutly &s;upported, that their Excommunications were terri|ble, even to their Princes; &s;o that the Nobles, generally from Prudence as well as Inclination, procured them&s;elves to be initi|ated into their My&s;teries, and frequently, to be enroll'd among them. As they had the &s;ole Direction in all religious Matters, no Sacrifice, whether Public or Private, could be perform'd but by a DRUID. They were al&s;o the &s;ole Judges in all Controver&s;ies
<PB N="37" REF="011338_0040_0F85808460647330">
re&s;pecting Property: No Law could be enacted without their Ap|probation: They had the greate&s;t Influence in all public Coun|cils: And, like the <HI>Spartan Ephori,</HI> they could controul the chief Rulers of the Nation. They offered up human Sacrifices in Times of imminent Danger, or great Di&s;tre&s;s; for which Rea&s;on it is &s;aid, that SUETONIUS PAULINUS under NERO, utterly de&s;troyed their Groves and Temples in <HI>South-Britain:</HI> But the true Rea&s;on &s;eems to have been, their great Influence with the People, in &s;piriting them up to defend their Liberties, again&s;t the unmerited Incroachments and arbitrary Sway of the <HI>Romans:</HI> For &s;uch Sacrifices could be no more reproachful in the DRUIDS, than in the <HI>Romans</HI> them&s;elves; who, in no very di&s;|tant Period, had countenanced the like Cruelties: It was only in the 657th Year of the City, and in the Con&s;ulate of LENTU|LUS and CRASSUS, that human Sacrifices were forbidden at <HI>Rome:</HI> Till then they had been occa&s;ionally authori&s;ed there; and we meet with &s;everal In&s;tances of the like Practices among the <HI>Romans,</HI> long after that Period, in different Parts of the Em|pire. Indeed we find frequent Examples of this barbarous Cu&s;|tom, among mo&s;t Nations, in their Infant State; from the cho&s;en People of God, to the profe&s;&s;ed Objects of his Vengeance in <HI>Ca|naan;</HI> and from the more enlightened <HI>Greeks,</HI> to the more igno|rant and ill fated <HI>Mexicans.</HI> The De&s;truction of the DRUIDS in <HI>North-Britain,</HI> was more gradual, owing to civil Broils, and the Re&s;entment of Parties contending for Power; they having e&s;pous'd the weaker Side. Tradition informs us, that there were &s;ome Remains of them in <HI>Scotland,</HI> at that Time when the fir&s;t Chri&s;tians fled thither, from the <HI>Roman</HI> Per&s;ecutions: Where the&s;e pious Fugi|tives, from their &s;eque&s;tered Life in Caves, and other hidden Places, were called CULDEES; and from the Similiarity of their Cir|cum&s;tances, being not ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h'd by the Natives from the pro&s;cribed DRUIDS, they have been frequently confounded by Po&s;terity. They believed the Immortalily of the Soul; and the <HI>Metemp&s;ycho&s;is</HI> from one human Body to another, under certain Circum&s;tances: And they allowed of a future State of Rewards and Puni&s;hments. They u&s;ually burnt the dead Bodies of their Friends, and pre&s;erv'd their A&s;hes in earthen Pots, buried under great CAIRNS, or Heaps of Stones: Some of the&s;e Pots or Urns have lately been dug up, from under the&s;e CAIRNS, in the <HI>We&s;t Highlands</HI> of <HI>Scotland.</HI> The <HI>Druidical</HI> Functions were often here|ditary; and their Females, called DRUIDESSES, were no le&s;s famous for Divination, than the DRUIDS them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The pious and peaceful HYPERBORAEANS, &s;o often mentioned by the old <HI>Greek</HI> Writers, were undoubtedly the <HI>Celtic</HI> or <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> DRUIDS; for as what they tell us of the&s;e HYPERBORAEANS, cannot be apply'd with any Ju&s;tice, either to the <HI>Scythians,</HI> or <HI>Scandinavians,</HI> there is no other Cla&s;s of Men yet known, who
<PB N="38" REF="011338_0041_0F8580851BAE5590">
agree with their De&s;cription and Situation, but the DRUIDS. They tell us, that the HYPERBORAEANS inhabited a large I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">land, with many le&s;&s;er I&s;lands about it, lying to the N. W. of <HI>Europe,</HI> beyond <HI>Gaul,</HI> and in the great <HI>Atlantic</HI> Ocean; and that LATONA, the Mother of APOLLO, was born there: That APOLLO was the great Object of their Wor&s;hip; &s;o that after having fini&s;h'd the Building of the Walls of <HI>Troy,</HI> he is &s;aid by PINDAR, to have ha&s;tened to the HYPERBORAEANS: That the&s;e I&s;lands were frequen|ted by the Gho&s;ts of departed Heroes, and by friendly GENII, who revealed future Events in Dreams; and that one of the&s;e &s;maller I&s;lands, was the peaceful Retreat of old CRONUS or SA|TURN, after he had been deprived of his Sovereignty by JUPI|TER: Perhaps the pre&s;ent Notion, that &s;ome People in tho&s;e re|mote Parts, are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of what is called the SECOND SIGHT, or a Power of predicting certain <HI>di&s;a&s;trous</HI> Events, is a Remnant of the old <HI>Druidical</HI> Doctrines and Super&s;titions, and of this Be|lief in friendly GENII, or guardian Spirits. The Fertility of the Soil, Temperature of the Climate, and happy Situation of the Inhabitants of the&s;e <HI>Hyperboraean</HI> I&s;lands, were highly celebrated by many ancient Writers. They &s;ay that they were a religious, temperate, long lived, ho&s;pitable, hardy, and vigorous Race of People; that they were &s;ubject to few Di&s;ea&s;es; that they lived chiefly on Vegetabl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">; and were infe&s;ted with no Wars: That frequent Emba&s;&s;ies of Young Men and Virgins, crowned with Laurel, and cloathed in White, had from Time to Time been &s;ent from the&s;e ISLANDS, with Offerings of FIRST FRUITS, wrapped in Wheat Straw, and having their In&s;truments of Mu|&s;ick, to the Temple of APOLLO, in the I&s;land of <HI>Delos;</HI> where LATONA is fabled to have been delivered of him, and his Si&s;ter DIANA. Now ANACHARSIS &s;ays, that his Country-Men the <HI>Scythians</HI> dete&s;ted the U&s;e of In&s;truments of Mu&s;ic in their Reli|gion; and Laurel was not then known to exi&s;t in <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> or <HI>Scandinavia:</HI> Be&s;ides, when <HI>Rome</HI> was &s;acked by the <HI>Gauls</HI> under BRENNUS, it was the general Report in <HI>Greece,</HI> that this City had been taken by an Army of Foreigners, from the Country of the HYPERBORAEANS.</P>
<P>This Intercour&s;e between <HI>Greece,</HI> and the Country of the HY|PERBORAEANS, has been traced up to about the Time of the <HI>Tro|jan</HI> War: So that ABARIS, the celebrated HYPERBORAEAN PHI|LOSOPHER, and PRIEST of APOLLO, who came to <HI>Athens</HI> about 550 Years before CHRIST, to renew this Corre&s;pondence, and to vi&s;it <HI>Delos,</HI> could be none other than a DRUID, and probably too from the <HI>We&s;tern I&s;les</HI> of Britain. DIOCENES LAERTIUS ob&s;erves, that it was the Opinion of many learned Men, that the <HI>Greeks</HI> acquired their Philo&s;ophy from the BARBARIANS; among whom he names the DRUIDS: And it is allow'd, that the HYPERBO|RAEANS fir&s;t taught the <HI>Greeks,</HI> that the Earth was <HI>Spherical,</HI> and
<PB N="39" REF="011338_0042_0F858085E8B8AAD8">
&s;ituated in the Center of the World; whence it is conjectured, that what they called the SPHAERE of the <HI>Barbarians,</HI> was a Form or Machine contrived by the HYPERBORAEANS, for the ea&s;ier In|&s;truction of their Pupils in <HI>A&s;tronomy.</HI> Be&s;ides, as the Images u&s;ed by mo&s;t Nations, to repre&s;ent the happy State of Souls de|parted, are u&s;ually drawn from Subjects which were the principal Part of their Delights in this World; &s;o the HYPERBORAEANS, according to PLATO, among other Things, promi&s;ed in their PARADISE or ELYSIUM, the fine&s;t Fruits of every Sea&s;on, Choirs of Dancers, Theatres of Poets, vocal and in&s;trumental Mu&s;ic, public Fe&s;tivals, Banquets, and SCHOOLS of PHILOSO|PHERS: All which are in every Re&s;pect conformable to the known Rites, U&s;ages, and Belief of the DRUIDS. Thus, the DRUIDS being generally de&s;cended of the be&s;t Families, the Honours of their Birth, joined with tho&s;e of their Functions, and the Opi|nion of their great Learning, procured them the highe&s;t Venera|tion and Authority, among all the <HI>Gallic</HI> Nations: And it is natural to believe, that &s;uch a Set of Men, under &s;uch a regular In&s;titution, continually employ'd in the Search of Knowledge, and communicating their Di&s;coveries from Age to Age, mu&s;t have made great Improvements in PHYSIC, ASTRONOMY, MA|THEMATICS, PHILOSOPHY, and the other SCIENCES; according as their Studies or Re&s;earches were directed.</P>
<P>There was al&s;o another Order of <HI>Prie&s;t</HI> among them, but &s;up|po&s;ed to be inferior to the DRUIDS; called EUBATES, or FAIDS; whence the VATES of the <HI>Latins.</HI> The&s;e likewi&s;e &s;tudied the &s;ublime My&s;teries of Nature, and pretended to be in&s;pired: There are &s;ome Ve&s;tiges of their <HI>Name,</HI> among the <HI>Highland Scot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> and native <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> at this Day.</P>
<P>The BARDS were a Set of Men, inferior to both DRUIDS, and FAIDS: They were the Di&s;ciples of the DRUIDS; but they were no Prie&s;ts, nor interfered with religious Matters: Their Per&s;ons however were every where &s;acred, among the old <HI>German</HI> and <HI>Gallic</HI> Nations, and they were the u&s;ual HERALDS of State, between contending Chiefs. They were by Profe&s;&s;ion POETS, em|ploy'd on Subjects merely mortal; and who celebrated in Songs, the Genealogies of the Great, and the Gallant Deeds of depar|ted Warriors: Nor were the &s;ofter Pa&s;&s;ions forgot in their Com|po&s;itions, as is evident from the&s;e genuine and invaluable Re|mains of ancient Poetry, a&s;cribed to OSSIAN: They were ex|empt from Taxes, and all public Duties, both Civil and Mili|tary: They frequently went from Place to Place, repeating their Songs for Hire, like the <HI>Scandinavian</HI> SCALDS; or rather like the AOIDOI <GAP DESC="foreign"> of the <HI>Greeks,</HI> among whom &s;ome have cla&s;&s;ed the immortal HOMER him&s;elf. The BARDS at la&s;t came to be retained in the Families of the Great, as Implements of
<PB N="40" REF="011338_0043_0F858086C1A470D0">
State: Their Function became hereditary; Lands were a&s;&s;igned to their Office in Perpetuity; and they continued in the highe&s;t E&s;timation with the antient Natives, for many Ages after the Ex|tirpation of the DRUIDS; as appears from OSSIAN'S Poems, and the Traces of that Profe&s;&s;ion &s;till extant, in &s;ome remote Parts of <HI>Britain.</HI></P>
<P>It is worthy of Remark, that all the ancient Nations, who fir&s;t cultivated or made any con&s;iderable Improvements in ME|DICINE, have either attributed the fir&s;t Di&s;covery of it to their GODS; or have deified the Inventors. Such Sentiments at lea&s;t &s;how the high Veneration they had for this u&s;eful Profe&s;&s;ion; and how beneficial and nece&s;&s;ary they believed it to be, for the Pre|&s;ervation and Happine&s;s of Mankind. HIPPOCRATES ob&s;erves, that this Belief of the divine Origin of PHYSIC, was not only con&s;onant to the general Opinions of the World in his Time; but al&s;o, he thinks, agreeable to Rea&s;on. In &s;hort, all Nations, as they emerged from Barbari&s;m and Ignorance, and improved in civil Polity and Knowledge, have encouraged and re&s;pected the Learned in the HEALING ART; as the Friends and Benefactors of Society, and of Mankind. They rewarded their Services while living, with a Liberality almo&s;t beyond Belief; and revered their Memories after Death, not more honourably by monumental In|&s;criptions, Medals, and Statues; than gratefully, by continuing their public Benefactio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">, even to their Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>Let us next view the State of the MEDICINAL PROFESSION, among certain foreign Nations, who, tho' <HI>Ancient</HI> as to their Origin and Government, may yet be con&s;idered as <HI>Modern,</HI> with Re&s;pect to our Acquaintance with them.</P>
<P>The CHINESE have applied them&s;elves to the Study of MEDI|CINE, from the very Infancy of their Empire; and they have a great Number of ancient Authors, upon that Subject. The Pro|fe&s;&s;ion is not only much re&s;pected among them; but their own Phy&s;icians al&s;o are ju&s;tly e&s;teemed, for their Sagacity and &s;ingular Acutene&s;s in di&s;tingui&s;hing Di&s;ea&s;es, and forming Progno&s;ticks by the Pul&s;e; tho' they pay great Attention to the Tongue, Eyes, Voice, and Complexion of the Patient, at the &s;ame Time, in forming their Opinions: From the Manners of the Country, they are &s;ometimes obliged to find out Di&s;tempers by the Pul&s;e alone; for many of the great Men will not permit their Wives to be &s;een or &s;poke to, but only to put their Arms thro' a Cur|tain, in Order for the Phy&s;ician to feel the Pul&s;e. DU HALDE has given us a particular Account of their Method of judging by the Pul&s;e, with their various Ob&s;ervations and Di&s;tinctions concerning it. Their <HI>Herbal</HI> is very copious, and contains many Simples not known in <HI>Europe;</HI> from which they form a Variety of
<PB N="41" REF="011338_0044_0F85808766094A18">
Compo&s;itions. The &s;ame Author gives us &s;everal Specimens of their Pre&s;criptions, both &s;imple and compound; and a&s;&s;ures us, that they are as expert in curing Di&s;ea&s;es with their Medicine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, as the <HI>Europaeans</HI> are with-theirs. The Profe&s;&s;ion of the PHYSI|CIAN among them, is di&s;tinct from that of the DRUGGIST, or APOTHECARY; and he is paid for his Vi&s;its. They have al&s;o their <HI>Quacks;</HI> &s;ome of whom pretend to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a Medicine, which will render tho&s;e who take it, <HI>immortal.</HI> They are circum&s;tantial in their Manner of collecting and curing their Drugs; minute in di&s;tingui&s;hing Di&s;ea&s;es; and attentive to every Con&s;ideration &s;ugge&s;ted by Difference of Age, Sex, Tempera|ment, Climate, Diet, or Occupation, or by the various Conditions of Women. Every Part of the <HI>Elephant</HI> is u&s;ed by them in Me|dicine, in &s;ome Form or other; and the <HI>Gin&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ng</HI> Root is a &s;ove|reign Remedy, for numberle&s;s D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;orders. They are however very &s;uperficial Anatomi&s;ts; and have therefore made little Progre&s;s in <HI>Medicine</HI> as a SCIENCE: And they are very whim&s;ical in their Theories. Before their Acquaintance with the <HI>Europeans,</HI> they knew little of CHYMISTRY, and nothing of the CIRCURLATION of the BLOOD; whatever they may pretend to the contrary: Yet they knew the Method of opening a Vein, tho' they &s;eldom prac|ti&s;ed it. The U&s;e of <HI>Enemata</HI> or Injections, they learned from the <HI>Europaeans;</HI> and therefore call them, the Remedy of the <HI>Bar|barians;</HI> for &s;uch they account all Nations, be&s;ides them&s;elves. Several of their Monarchs are believed to have both practi&s;ed, and improved MEDICINE; and if we believe their Accounts, there were Imperial ACADEMIES anciently e&s;tabli&s;hed, for that Purpo&s;e: <HI>Nankin</HI> is p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rticularly famous at this Day, for the Cul|tivation of the Arts and Sciences; and has the greate&s;t Number of Libraries, of any City in <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>There is an Anecdote mentioned in the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Hi&s;tories, which, while it proves their high E&s;timation of the HEALING ART, yet greatly invalidates the boa&s;ted Antiquity of their <HI>Chronology:</HI> They tell us that CHI-HOAM-TI, acknowledged to be one of their greate&s;t Monarchs, being intere&s;ted in the De&s;truction of all the ancient hi&s;torical Records, and of tho&s;e who pre&s;erved the Memory of them, cau&s;ed all Books to be burnt, except &s;uch as treated of AGRICULTURE, and MEDICINE; in Hopes that his own Actions might eclip&s;e all tho&s;e of his Predece&s;&s;ors in the Empire. This happened about 213 Years before CHRIST. As the U&s;e of Paper was not known, the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> then wrote their Cha|racters upon wooden Tablets, or little Plates of <HI>Bamboo,</HI> which could not ea&s;ily be &s;ecreted or concealed; and therefore it is imagined, that this De&s;truction of their hi&s;torical Monuments, mu&s;t have been pretty complete: And that they can have few if any authen|tick Records, anterior to that Period. This Emperor built the
<PB N="42" REF="011338_0045_0F8580881F0AF1F8">
famous WALL, &s;o much admired by Travellers; to defend his Dominions from the Incur&s;ions of the <HI>Tartars.</HI></P>
<P>We have al&s;o in DU HALDE, an Account of a <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Trea|ti&s;e, on the Subject of Pre&s;erving HEALTH, divided into the&s;e 4 Heads; 1&s;t, <HI>of the Heart and its Actions;</HI> 2dly, <HI>of Diet;</HI> 3dly, <HI>of the Actions of the Day;</HI> and 4thly, <HI>of Re&s;t at Night:</HI> Wherein &s;eem to be contain'd, mo&s;t of the Modern Rules re&s;pecting Air, Aliments, Motion an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Re&s;t, Pa&s;&s;ions of the Mind, things retain'd or di&s;charged, and Sleep and Watching; which in the <HI>Medical</HI> Stile are called the SIX NON NATURALS. In violent Pains, particularly of the Gout, the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> burn MOXA upon the Parts affected. This Remedy, upon the Recommendation of SIR WILLIAM TEMPLE, was for &s;ome Time the fa&s;hionable Appli|cation for the Gout, in <HI>England;</HI> but is now laid a&s;ide.</P>
<P>Among the People of JAPAN, the Antiquity and E&s;timation of this Art, are carried as high as with the <HI>Chine&s;e.</HI> They a&s;cribe the Inven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ion and fir&s;t Practice of it, to their KINGS; who, by their Computation, lived long before the <HI>Mo&s;aic Deluge.</HI> Their PHYSICIANS have the Reputation of great Skill and Abilities; and it is remarked that they mo&s;t commonly pre&s;cribe their Me|dicines in a &s;olid Form; and make very frequent U&s;e of <HI>Rhu|barb</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;&s;ia;</HI> But the ART of SURGERY is very little practi&s;ed among them, and le&s;s under&s;tood. The <HI>Japane&s;e</HI> are gro&s;s <HI>Pa|gans,</HI> or rather have little real Religion of any kind; for they treat their <HI>Idols</HI> with great Contempt and Freedom, whenever they are di&s;plea&s;ed with them. As to their National Character, they are ju&s;t in their Dealings; faithful to their Promi&s;es; civil to Strangers admitted among them; and of &s;trict Veracity: They have but one Language, and one Mea&s;ure over all the Em|pire: Their Laws are every where uniform, and duely execu|ted: Property is well &s;ecured, and generally hereditary; Perjury, Theft, and Gaming for Money, are puni&s;hed with Death: They are remarkably fond of Mu&s;ic, and admit it to all their Enter|tainments. They are not permitted to leave their Country, on any Pretence; and if they do, they can never return. In State Of|fences, the Emperor generally orders the Nobleman in Di&s;grace, to be his own Executioner, on an appointed Day: This is accoun|ted an Indulgence, and always complied with: But the Kindred and Friends of the Criminal, are frequently involved in his Fate. It is fa&s;hionable with the <HI>Japane&s;e</HI> Noblem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n, among other Bran|ches of their polite Learning, to apply them&s;elves to the STUDY of PHYSIC; in Order to recommend them&s;elves more effectually to the Emperor's Favour. None however are allowed to write or publi&s;h Books, but their DAIRO, or <HI>Chief Prie&s;t,</HI> with his Family, and De&s;cendants, who for this Rea&s;on, are particularly induced to apply them&s;elves to Learning. The <HI>Japane&s;e</HI> PHYSICIANS
<PB N="43" REF="011338_0046_0F858088DE6789F0">
make very little U&s;e of Bleeding: And in violent Pains, or Spa&s;modic Affections, they u&s;e <HI>Acupuncture;</HI> or burn MOXA upon the Parts affected: This Practice is al&s;o followed by the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> in the like Complaints, as well as in the Gout.</P>
<P>The State of Phy&s;ic among the BRAMINS, and Inhabitants of <HI>Indo&s;tan,</HI> has been already taken Notice of. We &s;hall only add here, that they u&s;ually divide Di&s;ea&s;es into certain Cla&s;&s;es; and that their PHYSICIANS confine them&s;elves to one or two of &s;uch Cla&s;&s;es, that they may excell in tho&s;e they particularly profe&s;s. They are very exact and punctilious with Regard to Regimen; and have a particular Regimen for mo&s;t Di&s;ea&s;es. They have &s;ome Knowledge of CHYMISTRY; and make frequent U&s;e of Medicines prepared by Fire. They have a <HI>Book</HI> of <HI>In&s;titutes,</HI> in which is contained all their <HI>Medicinal Knowledge.</HI> Their PROG|NOSTICKS are much influenced, by &s;uper&s;titious Ob&s;ervations. They are very nice in their Choice of Medicines, and Me|thod of pre&s;erving them. They carefully con&s;ider both the <HI>Pul&s;e</HI> and <HI>Excretions,</HI> in order to form ju&s;t Notions of Di&s;ea&s;es; but they were ignorant of ANATOMY, or the CIRCULATION of the BLOOD, when fir&s;t vi&s;ited by the <HI>Europeans.</HI></P>
<P>In the I&s;land of CEYLON, the Practice of PHYSIC, as well as their Modes of Wor&s;hip, and religious Tenets, are very &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the MOGUL Nations, and Bramins. They make fre|quent U&s;e of &s;trongly purgative <HI>Simples;</HI> and apply &s;teeped <HI>Pepper</HI> outwardly, in all Complaints of the Bowels. The <HI>Ele|phant</HI> is al&s;o much u&s;ed here in Medicine; and the I&s;land abounds with various Drugs, and valuable Spiceries.</P>
<P>In the I&s;land of AMBOYNA, they are remarkably expert in the Knowlege of poi&s;onous Plants; and not le&s;s &s;o, in the Ap|plication of their Antidotes. The Natives of the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> in general, particularly of the I&s;lands, are chiefly &s;tudious of the noxious Properties of Vegetables; tho' it mu&s;t be owned, that they are al&s;o well acquainted with many &s;alutary and Medicinal Productions.</P>
<P>In SIAM, the <HI>Practice</HI> of MEDICINE con&s;i&s;ts in admini&s;tering a certain Number of Receits, which have been handed down from their Ance&s;tors; and which, like our modern Quacks, they apply at Random, without Regard to the different Cau&s;es, or di&s;tingui&s;hing Symptoms of Di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>Among the TARTARS of THIBET, the LAMAS or Prie&s;ts are their only PHYSICIANS. They pre&s;cribe the mo&s;t common <HI>Sim|ples,</HI> and chiefly &s;uch as are u&s;ed in <HI>China.</HI> We are a&s;&s;ured, that &s;ome of them are well acquainted with the Methods of cu|ring
<PB N="44" REF="011338_0047_0F8580899E857618">

The <HI>Tartars</HI> believe their chief LAMA, to be a living Deity ever pre&s;ent with them; and accordingly wor&s;hip him &s;eated upon an Altar in their Temple, whenever he plea&s;es to &s;how him&s;elf for that Pur|po&s;e: They believe that he never dies, but only changes his Per&s;on, or the Body the choo&s;es to inhabit, as &s;uits his Inclination: The Vulgar have the &s;ame Notions, with Re&s;pect to their &s;ubor|dinate Lamas.

<P>The ARABIANS were long acquainted with the Practical Part of MEDICINE, before the Foundation of the <HI>Saracen</HI> Empire: 'Tis believed, that their Prophet MAHOMET had &s;ome Knowledge of MEDICINE him&s;elf; and that therefore it was ever afterwards highly e&s;teemed, by his Succe&s;&s;ors in the <HI>Caliphat.</HI> The <HI>Saracens,</HI> in the beginning of <HI>Mahometani&s;m,</HI> &s;carce applied them&s;elves to any Study, be&s;ides that of cultivating their own Language, and under&s;tanding their own Laws, except PHYSIC; but this Pro|fe&s;&s;ion was generally e&s;teemed among them, as being of univer&s;al Advantage to Mankind. It was the barbarous Policy of this People, to de&s;troy all Books, and other Ve&s;tiges of Literature wherever they carried their Conque&s;ts: Accordingly, AMROU, having made him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and being loath to de&s;troy &s;o famous and valuable a LIBRARY as he found in that City, &s;ent to the CALIPH OMAR, to know his Plea&s;ure; he recei|ved for An&s;wer, that if the&s;e Books contained the &s;ame as the CORAN, they could be of no U&s;e; and if they advanced any thing contrary to it, they &s;hould therefore be burnt. This was accordingly executed, excepting &s;uch as treated of MEDICINE; the&s;e were carefully pre&s;erved from the Conflagration. The Quantity of Volumes which had been collected there, at an immen&s;e Expence, for a Series of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ges, was &s;o great, that it &s;upplied Fuel to the <HI>Bagnios,</HI> for the Space of &s;ix Months; tho' there were no le&s;s than 4000 at that Time in <HI>Alexandria.</HI> Thus the Remains of the PTOLOMEAN LIBRARY, which had &s;urvived the calamitous Accidents of CAESAR's Wars, were now intenti|onally and almo&s;t intirely con&s;umed by the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e Votaries to Super|&s;tition and Enthu&s;ia&s;m. It has been remarked that Arts and Sciences have undergone Revolutions, &s;omewhat &s;imilar to tho&s;e of States and Empires. The Irruptions of the <HI>Goths,</HI> and other <HI>Northern Nations</HI> into the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, in the 5th Century, was attended with the De&s;truction of almo&s;t every Monument of Learning, in the We&s;tern World: And about two Centuries afterwards, the <HI>Saracens</HI> and <HI>Followers</HI> of <HI>Mahomet</HI> in the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> laid the Foundation of an Empire, which in the Space of abo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> 80 Years, extended its Dominion with amazing Rapidity,

Notwith&s;tanding this Havoc among the Records of Antiquity, the FATHERS of PHYSIC, as has been &s;aid above, found an A&s;ylum with the&s;e religious Conquerors. Afterwards, when <HI>Spain,</HI> in the 9th Century, was reduced to the <HI>Moori&s;h</HI> Yoke, they began to attend to the Arts of Peace, and founded COLLEGES there; to which there was a great Re&s;ort of Students, from all Parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> particularly to learn the HEALING ART.

They have a particular INFIRMARY be|longing to the SERAGLIO. The Sultan's PHYSICIAN is greatly re&s;pected, and always eats in the Palace, with the CA<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">EE AGA, or Chamberlain in greate&s;t Authority; and for whom there is allowed a &s;eparate Table and Attendance.

<P>The PERUVIANS, as we are told in the Hi&s;tory of their INCAS, had &s;everal Medical Secrets and Operations, for various Di&s;ea&s;es, which had been tran&s;mitted from Father to Son; and which they had learned from long Experience: Tho' they had a pretty exten&s;ive Knowlege of Remedies, they had not advanced &s;o far in that Branch of Learning, as to have any regular <HI>Theory</HI> re&s;pec|ing Di&s;ea&s;es, or to have reduced their <HI>Practice</HI> to a SYSTEM.

<P>The Revival of Learning in EUROPE, is in nothing more di&s;|tingui&s;hable, than by that ardent Attention, and early Encourage|ment given for improving all the various Branches of the HEALING ART.

The Compari&s;on, with all Re&s;pect to tho&s;e who think differently be it &s;aid, is too une|qual, ab&s;urd, and ridiculous to be &s;upported.</P>
<P>I cannot conclude this Inquiry into the ancient and pre&s;ent State of PHYSIC, without acknowledging, in Ju&s;tice to the ME|DICAL FACULTY of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> that THEY fir&s;t &s;et us the lau|dable Example of this In&s;titution in <HI>America;</HI> tho' the practi|cability of in&s;tructing Youth in this u&s;eful and learned Profe&s;&s;ion, among our&s;elves, has for many Years been an Object of Spe|culation here: Whereby we may in a great Mea&s;ure prevent the future Nece&s;&s;ity of long and perilous Voyages to EUROPE; as well as large Remittances of Money, which never more re|turns: Nor indeed is this the only In&s;tance of the <HI>wi&s;e Police</HI> and <HI>public Spirit</HI> of that flouri&s;hing and well regulated CITY, which de&s;erves our Imitation.</P>
<P>The ART of PHYSIC in&s;tructs us in the Method of pre&s;erving

Health when pre&s;ent; and in the Means of re&s;toring it when lo&s;t; or how to alleviate the Inconveniencies con&s;equent upon Health impaired, when a total Cure cannot be effected. This <HI>Art</HI> is by HIPPOCRATES called the NOBLEST of all ARTS; which heals, by adding that which was wanting, and taking a|way what is &s;upper<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">luous. And PLUTARCH &s;ays, that MEDI|CINE contains as large and fruitful a Field for Plea&s;ure, as any other of all the LIBERAL ARTS.</P>
<P>The whole Sy&s;tem of PHYSIC is comprehended under the&s;e two Denominations, the THEORY, and the PRACTICE. The Nature a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d Meaning of the latter is pretty generally under&s;tood: But the THEORY of PHYSIC, tho' the Foundation of all rational PRACTICE, being very little under&s;tood or attended to <HI>here,</HI> and con&s;equently its Advantages not &s;o obvious, a particular Explication of the Nature and U&s;efulne&s;s of it, will now the more readily be indulged me, as it will &s;erve at the &s;ame Time to convey a more adequate Idea of the Importance of this pre|&s;ent INSTITUTION.</P>
<P>There is but too frequent Occa&s;ion to remark, that we are apt to undervalue in others, what we our&s;elves do not po&s;&s;e&s;s, or de&s;pair of ever attaining; e&s;pecially when the Subject of our Envy gives any Pre-eminence to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or! This is in no Ca&s;e more applicable, than with Re&s;pect to the U&s;efulne&s;s of THEORY in PHYSIC; and will fully account for that Obloquy and Ridi|cule with which <HI>the Self-taught Doctors</HI> of this City, affect to treat a Plan of MEDICAL Education, which they either have not Sen&s;e to comprehend, or Hone&s;ty and Candour enough to regret the Want of. Such little Foes are pardonable; they indeed claim our Pity; becau&s;e they know no better. But when an intel|ligent Head, is totally guided by an unfeeling and malevolent Heart: When the Want of <HI>academical</HI> In&s;truction in his Profe&s;|&s;ion, is artfully concealed under many real and more &s;tudied Oddities of Behaviour; by &s;hunning every Occa&s;ion of Medical Conver&s;e with &s;uch as can judge of his Skill, or cen&s;ure his Practice; by amu&s;ing his credulous Hearers with vulgar Je&s;ts, or the too generally delectable Arts of Defamation, and illiberal Abu&s;e of tho&s;e, who have been more fortunate in Opportunities of Improvement than him&s;elf: When a Spirit of Rapacity is glo&s;&s;ed over by boa&s;ted <HI>No&s;trums,</HI> and fictitious Cures; or otherwi&s;e, by him&s;elf, or his <HI>Emi&s;&s;aries,</HI> practi&s;ing upon the di&s;tempered Ima|ginations of the &s;ick; and by every other mean and reproachful Artifice; it might well excite the Amaze and Regret of every Friend to Learning, and of every good Member of Society, &s;hould he find that the in&s;idious Opinions of &s;uch a <HI>Medical Phaenomenon,</HI> who reflects &s;o little Honour upon the City he lives in, and much le&s;s upon the Profe&s;&s;ion he follows, were &s;till, as

heretofore, not only li&s;tened to, but applauded. However I would willingly hope, that this re&s;pectable Community will, for the future, form their Opinions of this Profe&s;&s;ion, and of this pre&s;ent Undertaking, from their own Under&s;tanding and Ob|&s;ervation; and that Strangers, who &s;hall henceforth vi&s;it the&s;e ho&s;pitable Regio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">, for the Sake of Health, will not too ha&s;tily judge of the whole FACULTY here, from the ungracious Practi&s;es of a HETEROCLITE DOCTOR, or the relentle&s;s Cravings of an in&s;atiable LEECH.</P>
<P>Before we proceed, let us here con&s;ider &s;uch common Objecti|ons made to the U&s;efulne&s;s of THEORY, as carry with them any Appearance of Rea&s;on or Plau&s;ibility.</P>
<P>It &s;eems to be univer&s;ally allowed, that Experience alone can never form a rational PHYSICIAN: Yet &s;ome decry THEORY, as of no U&s;e in explaining Di&s;ea&s;es, becau&s;e, &s;ay they, it cannot be accommodated to all of them. But &s;uch Di&s;putants may as well contend, that becau&s;e THEORY cannot obtain in all Di&s;ea|&s;es, it therefore does in none; which would be to contradict all Sen&s;e and Ob&s;ervation. Others, becau&s;e they are not ac|cu&s;tomed, or not willing, or perhaps not able to inve&s;tigate the Cau&s;es of Di&s;ea&s;es, reckon <HI>Theory</HI> not only as u&s;ele&s;s, but would in&s;inuate al&s;o, that it may &s;ometimes be dangerous in Practice. Now, what can be more ab&s;urd, than to imagine that a PHYSI|CIAN will be the more un&s;ucce&s;sful, the better he under&s;tands the Di&s;temper? Or that he who &s;ees clearly into the Origin and Cau&s;e of an Indi&s;po&s;ition, &s;hould therefore be the more incapa|ble of rightly applying a Remedy? Or on the contrary, that he &s;hould be the mo&s;t happy in his Cures, who is altogether ignorant why one Method &s;hould be pur&s;ued rather than another? The Futility of &s;uch Objections is obvious to every Capacity. Others again &s;ay, that Di&s;ea&s;es have been cured by Per&s;ons ignorant of all THEORY; who neither under&s;tood ANATOMY, the ANI|MAL OECONOMY, nor the Manner in which <HI>Remedies</HI> operate! This has &s;ometimes undoubtedly been the Ca&s;e; and happy are they who have e&s;caped, to tell the Tidings! But were we to examine the <HI>Practice</HI> of &s;uch Per&s;ons, and ob&s;erve how un&s;ea&s;on|ably mo&s;t Medicines are applied; how many and how contrary Things are given; we mu&s;t acknowledge that their <HI>Apothecaries</HI> are much obliged to them, but their <HI>Patients</HI> not at all: For being unacquainted with the Nature of the Di&s;temper, or any certain Method of Cure, they <HI>range</HI> thro' the whole MATERIA MEDICA, in Hopes that they may fortunately <HI>hit</HI> upon a Remedy at la&s;t. There are &s;ome too who object to the U&s;efulne&s;s of THEORY; That there are Per&s;ons who, tho' intirely ignorant of any rational Scheme of Practice, yet by being much employed, have acquired &s;uch a Degree of Knowledge, as to &s;ucceed in
<PB N="54" REF="011338_0057_0F858091ABA2C2D8">
the Cure of &s;ome particular Di&s;ea&s;es! This Ob&s;ervation will hold equally good of every &s;agacious and attentive <HI>old Woman,</HI> or <HI>Nur&s;e;</HI> nor, if true, is it &s;o very &s;urprizing, when it is con&s;idered, that &s;ome Di&s;ea&s;es recur as it were in a Circle. But &s;hould any new Di&s;temper ari&s;e, and &s;uch as this Practitioner never &s;aw before, our <HI>Champion</HI> of <HI>Experience</HI> would then be much at a L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s, and turn over his mu&s;ty Receipts and Commen|taries long in vain, 'ere he could di&s;cover any Light to guide him to a proper Treatment. Whereas the judicious and rational PHYSICIAN, who is intimately acquainted with the Powers of the human Body, and the Nature of the Fluids; without being alarmed at any unu&s;ual Ca&s;e; applies the Ideas he had already formed in his Mind, about the Nature of Di&s;ea&s;es in general, to this particular Ca&s;e; by which he ea&s;ily di&s;cerns the Genius of the Di&s;ea&s;e; whence it ari&s;es; the true Indications of Cure; and what Method ought chiefly to be pur&s;ued: Amid&s;t the Va|riety of <HI>Drugs,</HI> he has no Difficulty in choo&s;ing immediately &s;uch as are mo&s;t proper for his Purpo&s;e, and in fixing upon that Order he ought to follow in pre&s;cribing them. EMPYRICS do not &s;o much di&s;tingui&s;h between Di&s;ea&s;es them&s;elves, as the <HI>Names</HI> of Di&s;ea&s;es: For In&s;tance in <HI>Fevers,</HI> the &s;ame &s;ymptoms frequently occur, where the Cau&s;e of the Di&s;ea&s;e and State of the Humours, are very different. Thus &s;ome <HI>Fevers</HI> ari&s;e from a <HI>Redundancy,</HI> &s;ome from a <HI>Rarefaction,</HI> others from a <HI>Lentor,</HI> and others again from a <HI>putrid Di&s;&s;olution</HI> of the Blood; all which require a different Treatment, according to their &s;everal Cau&s;es. Suppo&s;e now this <HI>Nominal</HI> Phy&s;ician to be &s;ent for; he would immediately form his Di&s;tinctions, or <HI>Diagno&s;is,</HI> as it is called, from the mo&s;t obvious Symptoms attending Fevers in general; and without further Inquiry, pronouncing the Di&s;temper to be a <HI>Fever,</HI> would boldly pur&s;ue the &s;ame Method of Cure in all! On the contrary, the rational PHYSICIAN explores not &s;o much the <HI>Name,</HI> as the <HI>Nature</HI> of the Di&s;ea&s;e: He endeavours to find out its immediate and remote Cau&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, with the State of the circulating Fluids; and from the&s;e is directed in his Application of Remedies: And often too, by a judicious ANALOGY, extends tho&s;e Medicines to many Di&s;ea&s;es, which U&s;e had perhaps too arbitrarily determined as SPECIFICS in one. How can he apply a proper Remedy to a Di&s;ea&s;e, &s;ays CELSUS, who knows not whence it ari&s;es, what Parts are affected, how they are con|nected, where they are &s;eated, or what are their Functions? And tho' it is undeniable that Experience is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to a Phy&s;ician; yet even this Experience can neither be pur&s;ued, nor &s;afely applied, without Rea&s;oning upon it; or without for|ming &s;ome Theory from his own Ob&s;ervations. Whence it may be fairly concluded, that THEORY and PRACTICE &s;o much re|quire each others A&s;&s;i&s;tance, that no one can ever de&s;erve greatly of PHYSIC, who does not unite them: And let us add, that the

be&s;t Collection of Medical Receipts or Pre&s;criptions which ever was, or will be made, can no more make a complete PHYSICIAN, than good Colours and Pencils alone, can make a fine PAIN|TER.&mdash;Thus then the Knowledge of the THEORY of PHYSIC, regularly acquired as a SCIENCE, according to the be&s;t and mo&s;t approved Methods of Study, is the &s;ure&s;t Guide to a &s;afe and judi|cious Practice; and di&s;tingui&s;hes the rational PHYSICIAN, from the daring EMPYRICK, and other <HI>trammel'd Labourers</HI> in this Pro|fe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>We &s;hall now con&s;ider the Nature of THEORY, and what it particularly teaches us. It is well known, that all other SCIENCES have their PRAECOGNITA, or Introductory Parts; and that no one can arrive at their Summit, without a&s;cending by &s;uch regu|lar Steps, as Rea&s;on and Experience inform us are nece&s;&s;ary to conduct him. The PRAECOGNITA, or THEORY of PHYSIC, com|prehends &s;everal curious, and intricate Subjects of Study; each of which alone is &s;ufficient to employ the Attention of a Student, for a long Time, before he can acquire &s;uch a competent Know|ledge therein, as will intitle him to practi&s;e with <HI>Safety</HI> to his Patient, <HI>or Honour</HI> to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The Foundation of all true and rational <HI>Medical Knowledge,</HI> is ANATOMY; or that dextro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s, nice, and methodical <HI>Di&s;&s;ection</HI> of the human Body, which di&s;covers to us its various component Parts, together with their Figure, Arrangement, Situation, and Connections. ANATOMY gives us the Mechani&s;m and U&s;es of the Bones, and of the Mu&s;cles; it de&s;cribes the Contents of the different Cavities of the <HI>Trunk</HI> of the Body: It teaches al&s;o, the particular Cour&s;e of the Nerves, and Blood Ve&s;&s;els; and how we may often di&s;cover the Origin or Seat of an Injury, when perhaps the Part affected or complained of, is very di&s;tant from it. The Demon&s;trations in this <HI>Polar</HI> Branch of MEDICINE, are &s;o palpa|bly nece&s;&s;ary and in&s;tructive, that they can never be too often repeated by every Denomination of the FACULTY, whether <HI>Pupils</HI> or <HI>Practitioners;</HI> for it is &s;elf evident, that they ought to know intimately and minutely the Compo&s;ition and Frame of the Body, in the natural and &s;ound State, before they attempt to remedy its Infirmities or Ailments.&mdash;To u&s;e a familiar Compari&s;on&mdash;would not a Man de&s;erve to be laughed at, who &s;hould undertake to regulate or repair any valuable or curious Piece of Machinery, (&s;uppo&s;e a <HI>Watch,</HI>) without under&s;tanding its Principles and Me|chani&s;m? Yet how many are guilty of a greater Ab&s;urdity, by tru&s;ting their own mo&s;t curious ANIMAL MACHINE, which it&s;elf alone is a WORLD of WONDERS, in the Hands of tho&s;e, who are ignorant of the Structure and U&s;es even of &s;uch Parts, as admit of equal demon&s;trative Certainty, with any Contrivance of Man's Invention?</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="011338_0059_0F8580929E19DF20">
Be&s;ides what we are in&s;tructed in by ANATOMY, which is principally concerned in de&s;cribing the human Body after Death; there are other Parts of Knowledge, re&s;pecting our pre&s;ent Well|being and Exi&s;tence, which are properly the Subjects of PHYSI|OLOGY.&mdash;This Branch of THEORY con&s;iders Man progre&s;&s;ively, from his earlie&s;t Exi&s;tence, before he has yet breathed the Breath of Life; before he is even fa&s;hioned in his Mother's Womb; and while all the boa&s;ted Pre-eminence of this future Image of Di|vinity, of this Deputy Ruler of the World, is that of a <HI>loco|motive Vegetable,</HI> a mere <HI>automatous Machine,</HI> an almo&s;t impercepti|ble <HI>Worm;</HI> to his Decay, or natural Death. PHYSIOLOGY treats of the Animalization of our Food; of the Properties and U&s;es of our various Fluids; of the Nature and Circulation of the Blood; of Re&s;piration; of the Sen&s;es; and, in &s;hort, of every <HI>Function,</HI> whither <HI>Vital, Animal,</HI> or <HI>Natural,</HI> which is, or ought to be performed by the Body, while in Health: All which are comprehended under the Appellation of,&mdash;the ANIMAL OECO|NOMY. By PHYSIOLOGY, we are enabled to form a ju&s;t Idea of Health, and wherein it con&s;i&s;ts: As from the total, or partial Depravation of any of the various <HI>Functions,</HI> which are or ought to be performed in HEALTH, we form the Idea of SICKNESS, in all its different Stages and Degrees. ANATOMY may be con|&s;idered as the <HI>Topography</HI> of the Body; and PHYSIOLOGY as <HI>its na|tural Hi&s;tory.</HI> ANATOMY is the guiding Star to the SURGEON; but both are alike e&s;&s;ential to the PHYSICIAN. We have already ob&s;erved, what great Improvements have from Time to Time been made, in PHYSIOLOGY, by opening and in&s;pecting the Bo|dies of different Animals <HI>alive;</HI> and otherwi&s;e making Experi|ments upon them. How far &s;uch Practices, tho' influenced by &s;uch good Motives, are reconcileable to Humanity, I will not pre|tend to determine: But when it is con&s;idered what important, what u&s;eful Di&s;coveries have been made in that Way; the Inqui|&s;itive both in PHYSIC and PHYLOSOPHY, will always congratu|late them&s;elves upon every Acqui&s;ition of KNOWLEDGE, however abhorrent they may be from &s;uch <HI>Means</HI> of obtaining it. We find too, that &s;uch practical Curio&s;ity prevailed in a very early Period of this Profe&s;&s;ion; and was even carried to great Lengths, if what &s;ome affirm of ERASISTRATUS, the &s;agacious PHYSICI|AN to the fir&s;t SELEUCUS, and of HEROPHILUS above menti|oned, be true. From what is already &s;aid, it mu&s;t be evident to every Man of Sen&s;e or Reflection, how prepo&s;terous it is, to at|tempt to remedy the Alterations and Changes produced in the Body by SICKNESS, without a previous particular Knowledge of its State in HEALTH.</P>
<P>But the&s;e Studies of ANATOMY, and PHYSIOLOGY, be&s;ides being con&s;idered as nece&s;&s;ary Qualifications for the Practice of PHYSIC, may moreover be looked upon as Branches of NATU|RAL

When we examine the various component Parts of the Body, with their different Com|binations and U&s;es, how are we amazed, to find all the Motions of this mo&s;t complicated Machine performed, according to the well known and immutable <HI>Powers</HI> of MECHANICS?

<P>Every Thing which can po&s;&s;ibly affect the Body, or influence its State of HEALTH, whether it be done by us, or &s;uffered by us, comes under the Con&s;ideration of PRACTICE.

Hence it is not to be wondered at, if the Alter|ations made in our <HI>State</HI> of HEALTH, &s;hould be as different, as are the <HI>Cau&s;es</HI> they may ari&s;e from; or that the &s;ame Di&s;|ea&s;es &s;hould be more or le&s;s frequent in &s;ome Places, than they are in others; and even that they &s;hould be &s;ometimes widely different in the &s;ame Places, according to their various <HI>Cau&s;es,</HI> and the <HI>Con&s;titutions</HI> they affect. This Diver&s;ity in the Symp|toms, and Degrees of Violence, by which Di&s;ea&s;es are di&s;tin|gui&s;hed, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily require the utmo&s;t Attention of the PHYSICIAN, in his Management of them; and it mu&s;t be very evident, from the&s;e Con&s;iderations, that no one <HI>Method</HI> of CURE can po&s;&s;ibly be framed, &s;o general or comprehen&s;ive, as to &s;uit every <HI>Climate;</HI> nor even the &s;ame <HI>Di&s;ea&s;e</HI> in every CASE, in the &s;ame <HI>Climate.</HI> We &s;hall in general ob&s;erve upon this Head, that a thorough Knowledge of ANATOMY; and of the ANIMAL OECONOMY, according to the late&s;t Di&s;coveries, and mo&s;t ap|proved THEORIES; a competent Acquaintance with the Powers and Effects of DRUGS; and a diligent Study of the be&s;t <HI>ancient</HI> and <HI>modern</HI> MEDICAL WRITERS, improv'd by his own Experience and Ob&s;ervations, &s;hould be the Bu&s;ine&s;s of every PHYSICIAN; and are the e&s;&s;ential Requi&s;ites, to a &s;afe and happy <HI>Practice.</HI></P>

Before I di&s;mi&s;s this Subject, permit me to add &s;ome few Thoughts upon the relative Duties of PUPILS, PATIENTS, and PHYSICIANS.</P>
<P>No PUPIL ought to apply him&s;elf to the Study of PHYSIC, till he has previou&s;ly laid the Foundation, in a competent Know|ledge of CLASSICAL LEARNING, and &s;ome general Acquaintance with the MATHEMATICKS, and NATURAL PHILOSOPHY. No Expence ought to be put in Balance with the Acqui&s;ition of every nece&s;&s;ary Branch of In&s;truction, to in&s;ure a &s;ucce&s;sful Practice. He, who con&s;iders how he may go the cheape&s;t Way to Work, too often purcha&s;es the <HI>Name,</HI> for the <HI>Reality;</HI> the <HI>Shadow</HI> for the <HI>Sub&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nce:</HI> A candid and cur&s;ory View of the e&s;tabli&s;hed <HI>Practitioners</HI> here, and in the Country around, will &s;oon convince the mo&s;t incredulous, of the Truth of this Ob&s;er|vation. As it may be pre&s;umed that no PUPIL puts him&s;elf under the Tuition of a Ma&s;ter, but from a Conviction of his Experi|ence and &s;uperior Under&s;tanding; he ought therefore to con&s;ider him&s;elf as at all Times accountable to his TUTOR in this SCI|ENCE, not only for the Progre&s;s he makes in his <HI>Studies;</HI> but al&s;o for every other Part of his Conduct, that can influence his Morals, or affect his Reputation: And to behave to him on all Occa&s;ions, with that Attention and Deference due to a <HI>temporary</HI> FATHER. He ought indeed to extend this Re&s;pect and Ob&s;er|vance, to all in the Character of MEDICAL MASTERS, tho' not immediately his own; in Order to conciliate to him&s;elf the Friend&s;hip and good Offices of every e&s;tabli&s;hed Practitioner, who can any Way contribute to his In&s;truction and Improvement, by Precept or Example.</P>
<P>It may appear o&s;tentatious, to give In&s;tructions how a PATIENT ought to behave, with Re&s;pect to his PHYSICIAN: But when it is con&s;idered, that <HI>both</HI> are only as A&s;&s;i&s;tants, contributing their mutual Endeavours to relieve or &s;upport Nature, as the Princi|pal; and that the Reputation of the PHYSICIAN often &s;uffers by the Indi&s;cretion or Ob&s;tinacy of the PATIENT; &s;ome Advice on that Head may not be altogether improper. I &s;hall now only ob&s;erve, that a PATIENT ought to be extremely cautious to whom he commits the Care of his HEALTH; but when he has once fix'd upon this his <HI>Friend</HI> and <HI>Coun&s;ellor</HI> in Di&s;tre&s;s, he ought to receive his Vi&s;its with that warm Welcome, and his Advice with that Deference and implicit Obedience, becoming the Importance of the Tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him. A Want of <HI>Confidence</HI> in the PATIENT, naturally begets <HI>Di&s;gu&s;t</HI> or <HI>Neglect</HI> in the PHYSICIAN; and it mu&s;t ever be di&s;advantageous, and &s;ometimes hazardous for <HI>Valetudinarians</HI> to change the PHYSICIAN, who has &s;tudied their Con&s;titutions, in all their Peculiarities; for one who is an intire Stranger to them.

But when he happily obtains his Purpo&s;e; when the late langui&s;hing Patient, is at la&s;t &s;natched from the Gra&s;p of the <HI>Grim Tyrant,</HI> and relieved from the Loath|&s;omene&s;s of a Sick Bed; a Retro&s;pect of that dreary and peril|lous <HI>Gulp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> he has ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed, compared with the joyous Sen&s;ations of HEALTH regained, &s;hould be the Mea&s;ure of his Return for Services performed, and <HI>now</HI> no longer wanted.</P>
<P>Manifold and important are the Duties of the PHYSICIAN. Eve|ry PRACTITIONER who charges him&s;elf with the In&s;truction of <HI>Youth,</HI> &s;hould be cautious of &s;etting them any Example, he would not wi&s;h them to follow. He ought to conceal Nothing from them in the Way of his Bu&s;ine&s;s, which it imports them to know; unle&s;s where his own Honour is engaged to keep it &s;ecret. He &s;hould always readily and with Complacence an&s;wer their Que|&s;tions, and &s;olve &s;uch Doubts as occur in their Reading, or in the Cour&s;e of his Practice; and in Terms &s;uited to their Under|&s;tandings. He ought &s;o to watch over their <HI>Studies</HI> and <HI>Conduct,</HI> as well knowing that the Succe&s;s or Reputation of the <HI>Pupil</HI> in Life, may ultimately reflect Honour or Reproach upon the MAS|TER. A PHYSICIAN ought to vi&s;it his <HI>Patients</HI> frequently; and to be minutely attentive to every Thing re&s;pecting them, by which their HEALTH may be affected. He ought to be patient to bear; and never a&s;hamed of informing him&s;elf, even by the meane&s;t People, of <HI>Remedies</HI> confirmed by Experience. Let it be remembered al&s;o by the PHYSICIAN who does not admini&s;ter his own <HI>Medicines,</HI> that according to the STATUTES of the COL|LEGE of SALERNUM, he ought to be obliged to &s;wear, that he &s;hall have no Share of Gains with the <HI>Apothecary;</HI> as the <HI>Apothe|cary,</HI> by the &s;ame STATUTES, was to take an Oath, that he would make up his Medicines faithfully, according to the Pre|&s;criptions given him. A prudent PHYSICIAN will never pre&s;ump|tuou&s;ly warrant the Succe&s;s of his Pre&s;criptions; as Experience mu&s;t have taught him, that the minute&s;t Circum&s;tances will cau&s;e a Variation in the Di&s;temper, either as to <HI>Danger</HI> or <HI>Du|ration.</HI> He ought to be decent in his Appearance; di&s;creet in his Manners; cautious in his Expre&s;&s;ions; mode&s;t and circum&s;pect in his Que&s;tions to his Patients; many of which may often with greater Propriety be propo&s;ed to their Attendants. He &s;hould be
<PB N="67" REF="011338_0070_0F85809D18C581C8">
moderate in all his Actions; yet always ready to do his Duty, without di&s;concerting him&s;elf. He ought to be humane, and compa&s;&s;ionate; no Talebearer, but &s;ecret; no rude Dogmati&s;t, but affable and polite: In &s;hort, all the Qualifications of the HEAD and HEART, becoming the <HI>Character</HI> of a GENTLEMAN, are indi&s;pen&s;ably required to con&s;titute the PHYSICIAN of Merit, who would &s;ecure the E&s;teem of his Patients, do Honour to him|&s;elf, or Support the Dignity of his <HI>Profe&s;&s;ion.</HI> If it is commend|able in him to collect Information from every one; he cannot &s;urely, when con&s;i&s;tent with the Duty he owes him&s;elf, refu&s;e to <HI>con&s;ult</HI> with other re&s;pectable <HI>Practitioners,</HI> in every Ca&s;e of Sickne&s;s, upon what can be done for the Benefit of the <HI>Patient.</HI> As the humane PHYSICIAN prefers the Welfare of his <HI>Patient,</HI> and his own <HI>Succe&s;s</HI> in <HI>Practice,</HI> to every Con&s;ideration which Pride or Avarice can &s;ugge&s;t; he will not only with Alacrity join in &s;uch CONSULTATIONS, when reque&s;ted to it, but &s;olicit them occa&s;ionally, as an Indulgence and Relief to him&s;elf: Whereas a contrary Conduct can only proceed from &s;ordid Motives, or the Dread of having his Ignorance or <HI>Mal-Practice</HI> expo&s;ed, to tho&s;e who only can judge of them. He ought to be extremely cautious of decrying the Advice or Opinions of others, either by open <HI>Cen&s;ure,</HI> or private <HI>Innuend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s:</HI> The former too often pro|ceeds from <HI>Ru&s;ticity</HI> of <HI>Manners;</HI> the latter always from <HI>intere&s;ted Views,</HI> or a <HI>di&s;hone&s;t Heart.</HI> But the <HI>&s;ignificant Shrug,</HI> the &s;olemn <HI>Shake</HI> of the <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ad,</HI> the affected <HI>Stare</HI> of <HI>Surprize,</HI> the <HI>&s;tudied Si|lence</HI> of <HI>ill di&s;&s;embled</HI> Doubts; in &s;hort, the <HI>in&s;idious Show</HI> of <HI>good Nature,</HI> the &s;ubtle and de&s;igning <HI>Delicacy</HI> of tho&s;e, who&mdash;

are the <HI>mean</HI> ARTS of needy <HI>Pilferers</HI> of Fame, and of Spirits poor indeed. To vaunt of extraordinary <HI>Cures,</HI> before &s;uch as are not competent Judges, or incapable of inquiring into the Circum&s;tances of them, may ju&s;tly render the Belief of them at lea&s;t doubtful. An O&s;tentation of LEARNING in common Di&s;|cour&s;e, even when his <HI>Profe&s;&s;ion</HI> is the Subject, is not always a Proof of it; on the contrary, to be unable to convey his Senti|ments, without having Recour&s;e to numerous <HI>Terms</HI> of <HI>Art,</HI> is generally a Proof of contracted Ideas, and a narrow Under&s;tand|ing. The Man of real Knowledge is generally mode&s;t, often dif|fident, always ea&s;y and happy in his Choice of Words, and ne|ver loquacious: While the &s;elf-&s;ufficient Pretender, like the babbling <HI>&s;hallow</HI> STREAM, is ever noi&s;y, froward, and petulant. A PHYSICIAN ought frequently to revi&s;e the different Subjects even of his youthful STUDIES, in order to run off the <HI>Ru&s;t</HI> of Memory, and render him more <HI>habile</HI> in Argument, as well as clear and di&s;tinct in Con&s;ultations.

which gives a De&s;cription of any new Di&s;temper, or a new Me|thod of Cure in an old One, or &s;ome remarkable Ca&s;e, de|&s;erves to be looked into, by tho&s;e who would make the proper Advantage of other Men's Experience. Perhaps it would be no ab&s;olute <HI>Paradox,</HI> to &s;ay with the learned DR. FRIEND, that a very indifferent Performance in PHYSIC, may now and then at lea&s;t be worth the <HI>cur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">y</HI> Peru&s;al of a PHYSICIAN; both as it employs his Thoughts his own Way; and as it mu&s;t, in the Cour&s;e of Reading, give him con&s;tant Hints, how far, and in what Manner, this or that Particular relating to THEORY or MEDICINE may be improved: And even &s;ometimes might &s;tart an Occa&s;ion, of &s;triking out Something new of his own.</P>
<P>One Thing more is &s;eriou&s;ly recommended to tho&s;e Gentlemen in Practice, who&s;e Judgment and Experience in the Di&s;ea&s;es of this Country, may have enabled them to undertake the Ta&s;k: That they would not only &s;tudy and improve upon the Ob&s;erva|tions of tho&s;e who have gone before them, but al&s;o collect o|thers for their own U&s;e, and the Benefit of their Succe&s;&s;ors. The various Changes which are continually happening in the State of PHYSICK, make this nece&s;&s;ary. For there are many Di&s;ea&s;es now exi&s;ting, which were intirely unknown to the Anci|ents: The Names both of Di&s;ea&s;es and Drugs, by Cu&s;tom, are differently applied; Improvements and Di&s;coveries are daily made; Medicines in the highe&s;t Reputation at one Time, are laid a&s;ide, and other &s;ub&s;tituted in their Place; and the Forms and Manners of u&s;ing tho&s;e retained, are perpetually diver&s;ifi|ed. Be&s;ides, the PHYSICIANS of this <HI>Country</HI> have &s;till more forcible Rea&s;ons, for imparting to the World, &s;uch Medical Re|marks as may &s;eem in&s;tructive or uncommon: For our Climate, Way of Living, and other Circum&s;tances, which ought always to be regarded in the Treatment of Di&s;ea&s;es, are &s;o very different from tho&s;e of the Countries, whence the mo&s;t u&s;eful and judicious Ob&s;ervations are tran&s;mitte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> to us; that the young Practitioners of this <HI>Continent</HI> mu&s;t be under the greate&s;t Difficulties, to accom|modate tho&s;e foreign Ob&s;ervations, by which they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;a|rily at fir&s;t be directed, to the Con&s;titutions and Complaints of their <HI>Country Men.</HI> Such a Collection would not only tend to the Benefit of Mankind in general, but would greatly redound al&s;o to the Honour of the Profe&s;&s;ion in <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>As there are many ingenious Men, who may have neither Lei&s;ure nor Inclination to appear in Print, and much le&s;s to write a Volume, who yet could communicate very u&s;eful Ob&s;er|vations, if they had an Opportunity of doing it in a conci&s;e Treati&s;e, and without Trouble; therefore it is ju&s;tly remarked, that Nothing has of late Years &s;o much contributed to the Ad|vancement of Learning in general, and to the Improving of this

Profe&s;&s;ion in particular, as the In&s;titution of SOCIETIES, or tho&s;e well regulated ASSOCIATIONS of GENTLEMEN, who col|lect, examine, and publi&s;h whatever in&s;tructive Remarks or E&s;|&s;ays are laid before them, according to their &s;everal Merits. Be|&s;ides, there are &s;ome other particular Advantages, re&s;ulting from MEDICAL SOCIETIES to PRACTITIONERS them&s;elves, as well as to young STUDENTS, and the PUBLIC. For <HI>there,</HI> different Opinions and Modes of <HI>Practice</HI> are examined; Experiments are <HI>there</HI> directed, or critically weighed, and applied: Dangerous and extraordinary Ca&s;es are frequently &s;tated and con&s;idered, in &s;uch SOCIETIES: And <HI>there</HI> Advice is a&s;ked and given, with that Opene&s;s and mutual Confidence becoming FRIENDS, not le&s;s zealous for the Honour of their <HI>Profe&s;&s;ion,</HI> than attentive to the Reputation of each other: While every Member chearfully con|tributes his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, to the Recovery or Relief of &s;uch <HI>Pati|ents,</HI> as are the Subjects of the&s;e CONSULTATIONS. And permit me to add, as one of many In&s;tances of the Utility of the&s;e SOCI|ETIES, that whatever Merit there is in this pre&s;ent INSTITUTION, it was fir&s;t planned and concluded upon, in a MEDICAL SOCI|ETY now &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in this Place; and MAY IT LONG SUBSIST.</P>
<P>The following <HI>Anecdotes</HI> were inadvertently omitted, till that Part of the Impre&s;&s;ion, which treats of the State of MEDICINE among the <HI>Romans,</HI> was ca&s;t off. But as I cannot in Ju&s;tice to my Subject, pa&s;s over a Piece of Hi&s;tory, which does &s;o much Ho|nour to the PROFESSION, I mu&s;t beg Leave to give it here <HI>more</HI> at large, though it has already in Part been noticed.</P>
<P>Whatever Di&s;couragements this SCIENCE laboured under, in the Time of the <HI>Roman Republick;</HI> they were amply compen&s;ated by the Honours conferred upon the FACULTY, by mo&s;t of their <HI>Emperors.</HI> The Title of ARCHIATER is found in &s;everal <HI>Roman Laws,</HI> and in old Authors: Some interpret it <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>Princeps Medicorum,</HI> or CHIEF of PHYSICIANS: Others explain it, <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>Imperatoris Medicus,</HI> or PHYSICIAN to the PRINCE; becau&s;e we read of no ARCHIATRI before the Days of the <HI>Roman Emperors:</HI> The fir&s;t Interpretation is preferable, be|cau&s;e we read of <HI>Theon</HI> and <HI>Glaucus,</HI> ARCHIATRI of <HI>Alexandria;</HI> and of <HI>Cyrus</HI> ARCHIATER of <HI>Ede&s;&s;a,</HI> tho' there were then no Sovereign Princes in the&s;e Cities. We find ARCHIATRI al&s;o in <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and in their Provinces of the Ea&s;t, as well as at <HI>Rome;</HI> for <HI>Oriba&s;ius</HI> tells us, that <HI>Julian</HI> a&s;&s;embled all the ARCHIATRI of the Country, and &s;elected 72 of tho&s;e he thought mo&s;t learned; of which Number <HI>Oriba&s;ius</HI> him&s;elf was one. The 14 PHYSICIANS appointed to attend the Sick, in the 14 different Wards of <HI>Rome,</HI> were called ARCHIATRI: They had Salaries from the Prince, and vi&s;ited all <HI>Roman</HI> Subjects, whither Rich or Poor, without Fees; except what the Patient's Genero&s;ity &s;hould

prompt him to be&s;tow, after he was cured: They enjoyed certain Immunities, which could not be claimed by other Subjects; as, that they, with their Wives and Children, were exempted from all the Taxes and Burdens of the State; that &s;uch as re&s;ided in the Provinces were not obliged to quarter Soldiers, or any other Per&s;ons; that they could not be taken Pri&s;oners, or dragged to the Bar; nor obliged to make a per&s;onal Appearance before the Judge; and that none might in&s;ult them, without incurring the &s;evere&s;t Penalties. The LAW which ordains this, &s;eems to extend the&s;e Privileges to all the PHYSICIANS of the Empire; but a &s;ub&s;e|quent LAW re&s;trains them to the ARCHIATRI of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>The ARCHIATRI both of <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> were divided into two <HI>Cla&s;&s;es:</HI> The Fir&s;t were called ARCHIATRI SACRI PA|LATII INTRA PENETRALIA REGALIS AULAE FLORENTES, or CHIEF PHYSICIANS who compo&s;ed Part of the Princes private Family; and who were always employed about his Per&s;on and Court. The others were tho&s;e of the City and Country, called ARCHIATRI POPULARES; who attended the In|habitants in general, or whoever would employ them. The ARCHIATRI of the PALACE were again divided into two <HI>Ranks,</HI> called COMITES ARCHIATRORUM SACRI PALATII of the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> or <HI>&s;econd Rank;</HI> according to the Degree of Con|fidence repo&s;ed by the Prince in their Skill and Abilities. Tho&s;e of the <HI>fir&s;t Rank</HI> were equal in Dignity to their <HI>Vicarii</HI> and <HI>Duces,</HI> and addre&s;&s;ed by the Epithet <HI>(&s;pectabilis)</HI> RESPECTABLE; they were by their Office, COMITES CONSISTORII, or COUNSELLORS of STATE; and were next in Honour to the <HI>(illu&s;tres)</HI> ILLU|STRIOUS, or fir&s;t Officers of the <HI>Empire.</HI> The&s;e COMITES always attended the <HI>Emperor</HI>'s Per&s;on, whence is derived the Name<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">COMES, a <HI>comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ando,</HI> or <HI>comitando;</HI> and is the <HI>Latin</HI> Word to expre&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he Title of EAR<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> in <HI>Britain,</HI> of COUN<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> in <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> and of GRA<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Germany.</HI></NOTE>; and being intru&s;ted with the Care of his Health, they had Acce&s;s to him at all Times. The ARCHIATRI POPULARES were al&s;o divided into two <HI>Cla&s;&s;es:</HI> The fir&s;t was of tho&s;e appointed to re|&s;ide in provincial Cities and Towns, in Proportion to their Ex|tent, and Number of Inhabitants: The other <HI>Cla&s;s</HI> was of &s;uch, as having been examined agreeable to the LAWS, had been newly admitted into that Order.</P>
<P>This <HI>Office</HI> of SOVEREIGN PHYSICIAN mu&s;t have been in&s;titu|ted under the fir&s;t <HI>Emperors:</HI> The Title of ARCHIATER, fir&s;t u&s;ed by <HI>Andromachus,</HI> PHYSICIAN to <HI>Nero,</HI> is of the &s;ame Im|port.

COMES ARCHIATRORUM. We find in <HI>Galen,</HI> that the <HI>Temple</HI> of <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters"></HI> was at fir&s;t, the u&s;ual Place of Re&s;ort for all the STUDIOUS and LEARNED, where PHYSICIANS too depo&s;ited their Books, as in a Place of Safety; till it was de&s;troyed by Fire. In the <HI>Athe|neum,</HI> a COLLEGE built by <HI>Adrian</HI> expre&s;sly for the Advancement of the ARTS and SCIENCES, PHYSICIANS had their Places of Meeting: The <HI>Emperor Severus</HI> al&s;o a&s;&s;igned them particular Chambers or Apartments; after which, we read of their SECRE|TARIES and LIBRARIANS. But under the later <HI>Emperors,</HI> there was a COLLEGE of ARCHIATRI, compo&s;ed of a certain Number of PHYSICIANS, who took their Places, according to the Dates of their Admi&s;&s;ion; &s;o that when any of them died, the Per&s;on cho&s;en to &s;ucceed, was lowe&s;t of all. This COLLEGE judged of the Capacity of <HI>Candidates,</HI> and cho&s;e, or rejected them accord|ingly; and the <HI>Emperors</HI> always confirmed tho&s;e who were elected. This is probably that SCHOOL of PHYSICIANS, in the Quarter of <HI>Rome</HI> called <HI>E&s;quilia,</HI> which according to <HI>Mercurialis,</HI> was or|namented with many fine Statues.</P>
<P>After the Subver&s;ion of the <HI>Roman Empire</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> the <HI>Gothic</HI> Kings introduced a great Change in this MEDICAL DIGNITY; for in&s;tead of &s;everal COMITES, they appointed one COMES AR|CHIATRORUM, or SOVEREIGN PHYSICIAN, who had a certain Juri&s;diction over all of that Denomination, and over all the PHYSICIANS of the State. The Powers of this NOBLE ARCHI|ATER were very exten&s;ive; as we learn from a Clau&s;e in the FORMULA of his <HI>In&s;tallment;</HI> pre&s;erved by <HI>Ca&s;&s;iodorus,</HI> Secretary to <HI>Theodoric</HI> in the 6th Century, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> <Q>Henceforth we confer upon you, the Dignity of COMES of the ARCHIATRI, that you may ALONE be di&s;tingui&s;hed among the GUARDIANS of HEALTH; and that all who &s;hall have Di&s;putes re&s;pecting MEDICINE, may &s;ubmit to your Determination. Be <HI>thou</HI> the ARBITER of this SACRED ART, and the <HI>&s;ole</HI> JUDGE of tho&s;e Controver&s;ies, which were formerly decided by Caprice or Prejudice. You will in Effect cure the Sick, by putting an End to tho&s;e Conte&s;ts, which are injurious to them. GREAT is your DIGNITY, to rule and direct Men of <HI>Learning</HI> and <HI>Skill;</HI> and to be HONOURED by tho&s;e, who them&s;elves are HONOUR|ABLE in the Eyes of all.</Q> After the 6th Century, the De|&s;truction of BOOKS by the <HI>northern Barbarians,</HI> involved MEDI|CINE and the other SCIENCES in the &s;ame Fate. Some Ve&s;tiges of them, during this <HI>Eclip&s;e</HI> of Learning, were probably pre&s;erved at <HI>Salernum;</HI> for we find different <HI>Praeceptors</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hed there, about the End of the 8th Century. May not the <HI>illu&s;trious</HI> and <HI>noble</HI> NAME of DE MEDICIS, be originally derived from the DIGNIFIED PHYSICIANS above mentioned; or from &s;uch as had formerly followed this PROFESSION?

<P>With Re&s;pect to this OFFICE of ARCHIATER, we &s;hall far|ther ob&s;erve, that it was an early In&s;titution among the <HI>Franks;</HI> for we find in a cotemporary Author, that <HI>Marileifus</HI> was CHIEF of PHYCIANS to <HI>Chilperic,</HI> in the 6th Century: And other Wri|ters tell us, that it thereafter was endowed with great Privileges; as, that he had Acce&s;s to the KING at all Times, even when in Bed; that he ranked with, and wore the &s;ame Robes as a COUNSELLOR of STATE; that he &s;uperintended the King's Baths, and licen&s;ed all Mineral Springs; that he had 8 <HI>Sub&s;ti|tutes</HI> who attended the Court by Turns, and who vi&s;ited tho&s;e who had been, or were to be touched for the <HI>King's Evil;</HI> and that he was every where treated by all of the FACULTY, with the Re&s;pect due to a SUPERIOR. <HI>Mon&s;.
