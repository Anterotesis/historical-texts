<HEAD>To the COMMITTEE of the third Pre&s;byterian Church in the City of Philadelphia.</HEAD>
<P>AT your reque&s;t, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> the following Di&s;cour&s;e ventures abroad, in a divided world of cen&s;ure and approbation. It was de&s;igned, by a &s;ummary &s;urvey of the conte&s;t wherein our country has been engaged, to excite gratitude to God, in your hearts and my own, for his great goodne&s;s be&s;towed upon us. If it's publication &s;erve to promote this temper in the minds of any, into who&s;e hands it may fall, the tribute of prai&s;e, that &s;hall a&s;cend for the &s;alvation &s;hown us, will in part be yours. If it fail of this end, the fault mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to the author, or the reader: For, &s;urely, the &s;ubject loudly demands our warme&s;t thanks to the &s;upreme Di&s;po&s;er of all events; who, by an admirable di&s;play of his providential govern|ment, has done great things for us. And, if in &s;ome future day, when the lei&s;ure hand &s;hall be di&s;turbing the repo&s;e of &s;ome co&s;t by neglected papers, that may have &s;tollen their way down &s;o far, this di&s;cour&s;e may attract the curious eye, and detain the attention a few moments; and contri|bute, in any mea&s;ure, to recal the &s;cene of our conflict, with one &s;entiment of gratitude to God, and a kind remembrance of tho&s;e who have borne the heat of the day, and tho&s;e who have aided our cau&s;e; I &s;hall account it a greater happi|ne&s;s, than to have claimed a mountain of Peru or Mexico, as my own.</P>

<HEAD>A SERMON, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>AN event of &s;uch magnitude and importance, as that which has occa&s;ioned our conven|ing to day, accompli&s;hed in &s;o &s;hort a &s;pace of time, and with &s;o &s;mall a &s;hare of difficulty in compari&s;on of what might have been expected, is one of tho&s;e occurrences in the kingdom of providence that command the admiration of every ob&s;erver. And whil&s;t it affords an irrefragable argument (to convince even an <HI>Athie&s;t</HI>) that the MOST HIGH ruleth over the affairs of men, and rai&s;eth up, and ca&s;teth down, at his plea&s;ure; demands al&s;o our warme&s;t gratitude to that GOD, who has done great things for us, whereof we are glad.</P>
<P>With a view therefore to a&s;&s;i&s;t in this delight|ful &s;ervice; permit me to invite your attention to tho&s;e emphatical words of the Prophet.</P>
<P><HI>I&s;aiah</HI> 66.8. <Q><HI>Who hath heard &s;uch a thing? who hath &s;een &s;uch things? &s;hall the earth be made to bring forth in one day? &s;hall a nation be born at once? for as &s;oon as Zion travailed, &s;he brought forth her children!</HI></Q></P>
<P>This pa&s;&s;age, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, has a ma|nife&s;t re&s;pect to that happy period, generally termed the latter day glory; when the various nations of the earth, formerly &s;tiled Gentiles, and yet in darkne&s;s, &s;hall in a &s;udden and &s;ur|prizing
<PB N="4" REF="018451_0004_0FA76CB43259C928">
manner, be converted to the knowledge and obedience of Chri&s;t: And the Jews, &s;o long rejected of God, &s;hall by an admirable di&s;play of divine power and grace, be gathered home from their di&s;per&s;ion, as in one day; and being formed into a people in their own land, &s;hall become the mo&s;t remarkable and leading part of the chri&s;tian church, in activity and zeal for their God, and for JESUS THE SAVIOUR, their then acknowledged MESSIAH. The former of tho&s;e events appears de&s;igned, by the earth bringing forth in a day; and the latter, by a nation viz. the Jewi&s;h, being born to God at once. Both which, taken together&punc; will con&s;titute that joy|ous &s;tate of affairs, which the apo&s;tle terms life from the dead. <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Rom. 11.15.</NOTE> But as the prophet has evidently in view to awake our attention to the hand of God, in his works of wonder among the children of men: and it is not without ex|ample in &s;acred record, to accommodate pa&s;&s;ages to &s;imilar events; <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Jer. 31.15.</NOTE> the importance of that event we celebrate to day; and the remark|able interpo&s;ition of the providence of God&punc; &s;o manife&s;tly di&s;played therein, will I tru&s;t, &s;uffici|ently ju&s;tify my applying the pa&s;&s;age before us to the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Matt. 2.18.</NOTE> To which al&s;o, it ap|pears with peculiar propriety adapted. For who indeed hath heard &s;uch a thing? who, but a few years back, would have believed the report, had a prophet him&s;elf declared it? his creden|tials, at lea&s;t, and marks of authority, had fir&s;t been carefully &s;cann'd with a critical eye. Who,
<PB N="5" REF="018451_0005_0FA76CB64EAF7DB0">
&s;ince time began, hath &s;een &s;uch events take place &s;o &s;oon? The earth has indeed brought forth, as in a day. A nation has indeed been born, as at once. It has not been I&s;rael's forty years of tedious wilderne&s;s journey; nor Rome's, or the United Belgic provinces, long continued &s;cene of arduous, dubious &s;truggle: But almo&s;t as &s;oon as our American Zion began to travail; and without experiencing the pangs and pains which apprehen&s;ive fear expected; &s;he brought forth her children, more numerous than the tribes of Jacob, to po&s;&s;e&s;s the land, from the north to the &s;outh, and from the ea&s;t to the yet unexplored, far di&s;tant we&s;t: That with great propriety, may we hail every friend of liberty, on this au&s;picious day, in the language nearly following our text; rejoice ye, with America, and be glad with her, all ye that love her, rejoice for joy with her, all ye that mourned for her. For thus &s;aith the Lord, behold, I will extend peace to her, like a river, and glory, like a flow|ing &s;tream. Here then, as from one of tho&s;e hills from whence the tents of Jacob were viewed of old, let us look back, on what God hath done; and contemplate the pro&s;pect he opens before us. And may he, in who&s;e hand are the hearts of the children of men, in&s;pire every brea&s;t with a grate|ful &s;en&s;e of his goodne&s;s, &s;o liberally be&s;towed through the whole.&mdash;The Briti&s;h monarch had formed a de&s;ign (for actions &s;peak louder than words) to reduce the&s;e &s;tates, then Briti&s;h colonies, into ab&s;olute va&s;&s;alage. A venal Parliament had
<PB N="6" REF="018451_0006_0FA76CB6C17E7A10">
approved the unrighteous purpo&s;e; and pa&s;&s;ed a decree to bind us in all ca&s;es, both civil and reli|gious, to the obedience of &s;uch laws as they might &s;ee meet to enact. Some have a&s;cribed this extravagant conduct to the &s;ame &s;pirit of jealou&s;y, which once influenced the councils of Egypt again&s;t the hou&s;e of Jo&s;eph; left waxing too powerful, they might break off their con|nection, and pur&s;ue a &s;eparate intere&s;t of their own. Pharaoh, indeed, might have rea&s;on to fear, becau&s;e I&s;rael were an entirely different people; and in their religion and manners &s;eparated far from the people of the land. But in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, though the court of Britain appear carefully to have copied the Egyptian model; and their mea&s;ures have produced a &s;imilar event; yet, as the people of the&s;e States were the &s;ame as the people of Britain, their religion and manners the &s;ame; and no di&s;po&s;ition to &s;eparate from them had ever appeared: But an attachment, even to enthu&s;ia&s;tic fondne&s;s, had always obtained; it mu&s;t have required an exorbitant &s;hare of infatu|ation to have rai&s;ed a &s;u&s;picion &s;o high, as to produce the &s;pirit and zeal that directed the Bri|ti&s;h cabinet. To rai&s;e a revenue, and bring America to bear her proportion of the national debt has been a&s;&s;igned as the motive. America, by centring her trade in Britain, contributed her liberal &s;hare, nor had &s;he ever witheld her blood or her trea&s;ure when requi&s;itions were made; that even malevolence it&s;elf had been nonplu&s;&s;ed from thence to derive a plea, unle&s;s through a
<PB N="7" REF="018451_0007_0FA76CB9DF8FAE70">
mad de&s;ire to take by compul&s;ion, what would otherwi&s;e be cheerfully given. It &s;eems therefore mo&s;t probable, his Britannic Maje&s;ty wi&s;hed to increa&s;e the power of the crown, &s;o as to wre&s;t the very &s;hadow of liberty out of the hands of all his &s;ubjects, and reign an ab&s;olute monarch; and for this end began where he hoped, by bribes and craft, to cloak his de&s;ign under the cover of Parliamentary &s;anction. It may be, he de&s;ired to urge America to arms; that being vanqui&s;hed (which &s;eems to have been taken as a granted point) and her principal men, and all who &s;hould dare to oppo&s;e his views, having either fallen in the field, or been executed as traitors, or con|&s;trained to fly to &s;ome foreign land; the whole of the country, with the &s;ubdued, da&s;tardly inha|bitants that remained, might revert to the crown. This, with it's native con&s;equences of American lords and va&s;&s;als, all at the monarch's plea&s;ure, mu&s;t &s;oon have weighed down the liberty of Britain. Or, perhaps he expected to intimidate into &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, by the appearance of a deter|mined military force. This charity would fondly per&s;uade us to admit, as being the lea&s;t wicked of the two. And in that ca&s;e, an ho&s;t of place|men and pen&s;ioners, with their influence among a people, de&s;titute of &s;pirit and &s;ubdued by threats; though not &s;o &s;uddenly, would yet as certainly have produced the de&s;ired effect: And finally impo&s;ed the &s;ame humiliating terms on Britain her&s;elf. But whatever might be the motive, America was marked out, for &s;ervile
<PB N="8" REF="018451_0008_0FA76CBB43869298">
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, or &s;evere &s;ubjugation: and the power of Britain employed to accompli&s;h the end. A day now ro&s;e, lowering thick with dark and heavy clouds, A &s;cene now opened, painful to the mind only to review. On the one hand, to re&s;ign every deare&s;t birthright pri|vilege; and bow down unconditional to foreign ma&s;ters, from whom we had nothing to expect, but &s;overeign contempt, and heavy burdens im|po&s;ed; who, by their remote &s;ituation, could neither &s;ee our calamity, nor partake in our &s;ufferings. Or on the other hand, to wage war with the mo&s;t formidable power on earth, that had been for ages a terror to the nations; and had lately ri&s;en into a &s;tate of grandeur and glory far &s;urpa&s;&s;ing all her former greatne&s;s. A nation long inured to war: Her fleets commanding the ocean: Her troops numerous and veteran; and in martial deeds, famed as inferior to none: Her wealth immen&s;e: Her re&s;ources many: And her pride and mi&s;taken &s;en&s;e of honor prompt|ing her to exert every nerve, to &s;ecure a com|pliance with her claims and demands. Hard alternative! to re&s;ign liberty, or wage this hazardous war. And yet none other remained. America had her numerous hu&s;bandmen, her merchants and mechanics; and her &s;ons of the learned profe&s;&s;ions, and &s;tudents in every &s;cience. Her inhabitants were many: But untaught in the policy of courts and cabinets; and &s;trangers from the art of war: And divided into different colonies, under different forms of government,
<PB N="9" REF="018451_0009_0FA76CBC14F5F780">
had &s;carce ever communicated &s;entiments on a &s;ingle point. Armies &s;he had none; nor a &s;ingle &s;hip of war to protect her coa&s;t. Arms and ammunition had never been her care; and her money &s;carce &s;ufficient for common occa&s;ions. Re&s;ources 'tis true there were; but as the pre|cious metal lies hid in the un&s;ought-for oar, they remained unexplored and unknown. In this &s;ituation, &s;hall &s;he dare to provoke the vengeance of Britain? a &s;toical ob&s;erver would have pronounced it madne&s;s. But LIBERTY was the prize. She cho&s;e "FREEDOM or DEATH" as her motto; and nobly re&s;olved on war with all it's horrors; that at lea&s;t, her la&s;t expiring groan might breathe forth FREEDOM. Already had Britain planted her baleful banner on our coa&s;t; and her proud in&s;ulting flag had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed our harbours. Her oppre&s;&s;ive edicts had gone forth; and her naval and military &s;trength were com|bined to enforce obedience. As the careful mariner watches the heavy gathering cloud, and dreads the approaching &s;torm; America, with anxiety beheld, and waited the event. Prudence would have &s;eemed to dictate an early re&s;i&s;tance to manife&s;t ho&s;tile de&s;igns; nor &s;uffer an avowed enemy to every privilege to entrench in quiet, and &s;trengthen them&s;elves in a capital town. <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Bo&s;ton.</NOTE> Nor was America blind to the mea&s;ure: but that God, who &s;o early e&s;pou&s;ed her cau&s;e, that her innocence in the ca&s;e, and her reluctance to arms, might be evident to all, witheld her from the deed; and left Britain, on LEXINGTON's ever-memorable

day, to open the &s;cene of war. Quick as the fla&s;h of lightning glares from pole to pole, &s;o &s;udden did a military &s;pirit pervade the&s;e then United Colonies; but now, ble&s;&s;ed be God, con|federated, e&s;tabli&s;hed States. The peaceful hu&s;|bandman for&s;ook his farm; the merchant relin|qui&s;hed his trade; the learned in the law di&s;mi&s;|&s;ed their clients; the compa&s;&s;ionate phy&s;ician forgot his daily round; the mariner laid a&s;ide his compa&s;s and quadrant; the mechanic re&s;igned his implements of employment; the &s;ons of &s;cience cea&s;ed their philo&s;ophic pur&s;uits; and even the mi&s;er half neglected, for a time, his gold and his gain, and the griping landlord his rents. All prepared for war, and eagerly flew to the field&punc; The delicate female her&s;elf forgot her timidity; and glowing with patriot zeal prompted the tardy to arms; and de&s;pi&s;ed and reproached the lingerer that meanly loitered behind. Nor were tho&s;e of the &s;acred order wanting to their coun|try, when her civil and religious liberties were all at &s;take: But as became faithful watchmen, they blew the trumpet on the walls of our Zion; and &s;ounded an alarm for defence. From then, &s;tandard was pitched again&s;t &s;tandard; and the battle was fought with various &s;ucce&s;s, from the ea&s;t to the we&s;t, and from the north to the &s;outh; and the field and the fore&s;t, the hills and the vallies, the &s;hore and the inland parts, have all heard the &s;houtings of the warrior, and the clang of arms, and &s;een garments rolled in blood; and &s;ummer's &s;corching heat, and winter's parch|ing

cold, borne te&s;timony to American per&s;eve|ance and valour. Nor was military prowe&s;s only given. He that put of the &s;pirit of Mo&s;es on the elders of I&s;rael, rai&s;ed up &s;enators&punc; and guided them in council, to conduct the affairs of his cho&s;en American tribes; <HI>(a)</HI> and though like the Jewi&s;h congregation of old, the language of murmur and complaint has been heard in our land; and we have had our <HI>Korahs</HI> and <HI>Da|thans,</HI> who&s;e endeavours have been to weaken the hands of our rulers; depreciate their merit, and le&s;&s;en their e&s;teem in the eyes of the people; yet (I he&s;itate not to pronounce it) generations yet unborn will look back with wonder; and venerate the memories, and long perpetuate the names of tho&s;e who guided the helm through the &s;torm; nor &s;unk di&s;mayed, whil&s;t &s;o furious an <HI>Euroclydon</HI> of innumerable difficulties la&s;hed &s;o &s;ore, and lay &s;o long upon us; but have at length, by the good hand of our God upon them, brought the billow-beaten ve&s;&s;el of public affairs &s;afe into harbour. The&s;e po&s;terity will admire and revere; and wi&s;h to have &s;een the day when tho&s;e men lived on the earth. A day, which commanded the attention of &s;tates and kingdoms, far and wide. And as Jo&s;hua's day arre&s;ted the &s;un in his cour&s;e, the nations &s;tood &s;till in &s;ilent &s;urprize, to &s;ee the balance of war &s;o nearly poized, between contending parties &s;o unequal. Fondly, would the &s;park of humanity within have led them to aid the American cau&s;e. Their wi&s;h was all they dur&s;t give: For they dreaded the omnipotent arm of Britain; nor dared to
<PB N="12" REF="018451_0012_0FA76CBF09D359B0">
awake her re&s;entment. The monarch of France alone was found, who&s;e generous zeal for the rights of humanity in&s;pired him, beyond the power of every meaner con&s;ideration. Solemn ties had bound him, to con&s;ult the good of the people over whom he was placed: Nor could he have an&s;wered to his God, his con&s;cience, or his kingdom, to have involved the nation in the calamities of an arduous, hazardous war, had no pro&s;pect of advantage ri&s;en into view. God, who had early de&s;igned him for di&s;tingui&s;hed honor; and rai&s;ed him to the throne, to e&s;tabli&s;h his name and his glory, as la&s;ting as the annals of time, as the PROTECTOR OF THE RIGHTS OF MANKIND, had therefore, by a firm decree, united the intere&s;t of America and France; that HIS MAJESTY might be ju&s;t to his con&s;cience, his people, and his God, whil&s;t indulging the ardent glow of his magnanimous brea&s;t, in af|fording to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed a vigorous aid: And his fleets and his armies were embarked in our cau&s;e. Let detraction therefore be &s;ilent, nor object the influence of intere&s;t, to fully the gene|rous deed. God has connected duty and intere&s;t, by indi&s;&s;oluble bonds; nor may either, of right, a&s;&s;ume the name alone. Ancient preju|dices, in&s;tilled by Britain, &s;eemed to forbid con|nection with a nation, we had long been taught to con&s;ider faithle&s;s, pu&s;illanimous, and cruel. The genero&s;ity of France recovered the mind to judge by a candid &s;cale. And as a mutual inter|cour&s;e increa&s;ed our acquaintance, the &s;cales of
<PB N="13" REF="018451_0013_0FA76CBFC0FA4E20">
ignorance fell from our eyes; the mi&s;t of pre|judice vani&s;hed: And America found her&s;elf united to the mo&s;t enlightened civilized nation on earth; and rejoiced in an alliance, cemented, not by intere&s;t only, but the &s;trong additional bonds of cordial affection. An alliance, which may that God who&s;e watchful eye guards the affairs of men, perpetuate unimpaired, while &s;un and moon &s;hall endure. The citizens and &s;ub|jects of both nations embraced as brethren; and fought &s;ide by &s;ide, with united hearts and hands, in the then made common cau&s;e. Their only &s;trife was, who &s;hould di&s;play the noble&s;t deeds; and render them&s;elves mo&s;t worthy each other's e&s;teem. America's day, the morning of which had lowred with heavy clouds, began to brighten a pace; and it's hurrying hours ha&s;tened their way to a noon tide glow. The ju&s;tice of her cau&s;e; the influence of her great Ally; and the in&s;ults and injuries experienced by other na|tions, from BRITISH ARROGANCE, procured her &s;till farther &s;upport; and narrowed the di|&s;tance to the object of her wi&s;h. Britain &s;aw, with indignation: And in firm alliance with every infernal power (for, from heaven &s;he dared not expect; nor would any on earth, He&s;&s;e, An&s;pach, and Savages excepted, afford her aid) &s;he re&s;olved on utmo&s;t vengeance: And as a Tyger in the fore&s;t, taken in the toiles, exerted her every effort. Nor need I here recount Monmouth, Cow|pens by Catawba, or Eutaw, with the many &s;ore fought days on the land; or the briney ocean,

repeatedly &s;tained with the generous blood of war, or the ravages that de&s;olated the &s;outh; or the deva&s;tation and ruin that ranged along our coa&s;t; whil&s;t their ruthle&s;s &s;avage allies, to the eternal infamy of tho&s;e who employed them, drenched the wide frontier with the warle&s;s blood of help|le&s;s women and babes. The&s;e deeds of Britain are written with the pen of remembrance on the minds of all. They are engraved, as with the point of a diamond on a rock, on the pillars of time; and handed down in the faithful hi&s;toric page, &s;hall long be read by ages yet to come. Nor &s;hall Carolina or Georgia, New-York or Virginia, Philadelphia, Rhode-I&s;land, or Bo&s;ton, be named, but grateful acknowledgments &s;hall ri&s;e of the kind deliverance afforded. And oft &s;hall the traveller turn a&s;ide to &s;urvey the &s;eat of Gloce&s;ter and York in Virginia, and view the &s;pot, ever to be remembred, where the great de|ci&s;ive event took place; and read in&s;cribed on the memorative marble, <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">A marble Pillar appointed by Congre&s;s to be erected there.</NOTE> the important victory there obtained.

For, according to this time &s;hall it be &s;aid of the&s;e United States, what hath God wrought for them? Great indeed, is the &s;alvation he hath &s;hown! And great the obliga|tions we are under to prai&s;e! For, had we failed in our ju&s;t attempt to &s;ecure our invaluable rights, America's choice&s;t blood had flowed in liberal &s;treams: And her mo&s;t valuable citizens, throughout the States, had expired by halters and in gibbets. The daring patriot, who&s;e zeal for his country had led him, with his life in his hand, to take a &s;eat in the great council of the States, or in legi&s;lation, or admini&s;tering ju&s;tice; or, who had led in the field, in his country's cau&s;e: The&s;e had been led forth the fir&s;t, in haughty triumph, amid&s;t ten thou&s;and in&s;ulting

Nor only the&s;e; but all who had dared to follow their councils, and abett the cau&s;e for which they contended; nor a &s;ingle character worth notice left remaining, that dared to breathe the language of freedom. And the paths of life had now been thin of the many virtuous citizens convened to day, throughout the&s;e States, to give thanks on this happy occa&s;ion. America had been enriched indeed; and her &s;oil made fat with the blood of her children. Made fat, not for the rightful owners; but to pamper the lu&s;ts of tyrannical landlords, &s;haring the country among them&s;elves: The &s;urviving former po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ors, only va&s;&s;als at plea&s;ure, and &s;laves to their lordly ma&s;ters. This, my friends, is not a flight of fancy; or apprehen&s;ive imagination run wild: It is founded in ju&s;t ob&s;ervation; and what bitter experience would have taught, but taught too late, had our enemy prevailed.

events! May the ble&s;&s;ings of heaven &s;urround them; and the honor and e&s;teem of a grateful country attend them through life.

Errors and mi&s;takes may have been: But it is matter of wonder and prai&s;e, that whil&s;t tread|ing an unknown, a difficult and dangerous path, their mi&s;takes and errors have been &s;o few. Surely the hand of God was in it, to guide and guard their way. And let THE ILLUSTRIOUS WASHINGTON, the Jo&s;hua of the day, and ad|miration of the age; who, in&s;pired from above with every military endowment, to command the American arms; and great in the field be|yond example, retires &s;till greater, to the humble character of a private citizen, among the citizens of the States; let him live perpetual in the minds and the prai&s;es of all.

Let their &s;ervices of hard&s;hip, toil and danger be never forgot: But may they ever experience a kind attention from their fellow-citizens; and a faithful reward from their country, who&s;e rights they have &s;o firmly defended. Let their military garb and character ever command e&s;teem. Let their wounds and their &s;cars plead their cau&s;e and ex|tenuate their foibles; and the re&s;idue of their exhau&s;ted days be crowned with honor and ea&s;e.

And whil&s;t the cur&s;e of Meroz remains on la&s;ting record, for tho&s;e who witheld their aid, let the ble&s;&s;ings of all re&s;t on every friend of liberty, who willingly offered him&s;elf, when his country's nece&s;&s;ity called him to the field: And on all who have cheerfully borne and &s;uffered in it's cau&s;e. Nor let our great and generous ally, who afforded an early and vigorous aid, be forgot. But let every American lip pronounce a "VIVE LE ROI," and every heart con&s;pire, "long may his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty, LEWIS THE SIXTEENTH," long may he live, a ble&s;&s;ing, and ble&s;&s;ed, on earth; and late re&s;ign an earthly crown, to &s;hine in brighter glory, and wear a crown immortal, among the ble&s;&s;ed above. And may his &s;ubjects ever be em|braced as brethren and deare&s;t friends who have fought our battles, and bled in our cau&s;e; and partiality here held worthy of prai&s;e. Nor may a due e&s;teem ever be wanting to the United Ne|therland States, who&s;e heart and endeavours were with us; or to the court of Spain for a&s;&s;i&s;tance afforded; but be generou&s;ly paid to all who have aided to &s;ecure our rights. And whil&s;t, with a grateful &s;en&s;e of their &s;ervices done, we pay de|&s;erved honours to tho&s;e whom God has honored, to bear a part in the great work performed; let every heart adore the God of goodne&s;s in all: And every lip, and every life, proclaim his prai&s;e.

and the cloud, through their wilderne&s;s jour|ney; wherein they al&s;o had their wandrings; 'twas he the &s;ame, pre&s;ided over our affairs; directed our councils, and guided our &s;enators by the way. 'Twas he, who rai&s;ed a Jo&s;hua to lead the tribes of I&s;rael in the field of battle, rai&s;ed and formed a WASHINGTON, to lead on the troops of his cho&s;en States, to final conque&s;t, and endued him with all his military patience, per&s;everance, prowe&s;s and &s;kill; and admirably pre&s;erved his life and his health, through all the danger and toil. 'Twas he, who in Barak's day &s;pread the &s;pirit of war in every brea&s;t, to &s;hake off the Canaaniti&s;h yoke, in&s;pired thine inha|bitants, oh America, with an ardent glow through every rank, to a&s;&s;ert the cau&s;e of freedom: And led forth the hu&s;bandman and mechanic; with tho&s;e of every cla&s;s, to offer them&s;elves undaunted in the daring conflict. It was he hid fear from their eyes, of either the &s;uperior number or &s;kill, of the powerful foe they ro&s;e to with&s;tand. And from him came down that firmne&s;s and fortitude, that rai&s;ed American officers and &s;oldiers, beyond all former example, through hunger, nakedne&s;s and cold, to fight the battles of their country; and never for&s;ake it's &s;tandard. It was he breathed from above, and fired their bo&s;oms, in the hour of action, to crop the laurels of triumph; or, having dearly &s;old their precious lives, to em|brace death, in all his glory, on the bloody field. And he only in&s;pired our generous

It was he, who rai&s;ed up Cyrus, to break the A&s;&s;yrian force, and &s;ay, <Q>let I&s;rael be free,</Q> endued the monarch of France with an angel's mind, to a&s;&s;ert and &s;ecure the freedom of his United American States. And, by him were the hearts of other nations di&s;po&s;ed to our aid. And he, and he alone, who &s;aith to the proud waves of the &s;ea, <Q>Hitherto &s;hall ye come, but no farther,</Q> re&s;trained the councils and arms of Britain from improving again&s;t us many op|portunities and advantages, which evidently lay within the line of their power.
