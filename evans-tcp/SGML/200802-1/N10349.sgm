<BIBL>1 CHRON. IV. 22.</BIBL>
<Q>&mdash;<HI>And the&s;e are Ancient Things.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AS this is the la&s;t day of the fir&s;t Century, and compleats one hundred years &s;ince Wrentham was granted to be a town|&s;hip, I have been importuned by &s;ome to deliver a di&s;cour&s;e on &s;o ob&s;ervable a period.</P>
<P>I did at fir&s;t decline it for &s;everal rea&s;ons; the principal of which is, my being but very &s;lender|ly furni&s;hed with matter for a work of this na|ture, by rea&s;on of my being unacquainted, ei|ther by private records, or particular traditional accounts, with the &s;pecial circum&s;tances of the original and progre&s;s of this town.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="013136_0004_0F8EC48015440BC8">
From this is ea&s;ily &s;een what a di&s;advantage I am under to preach on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. And tho' at the &s;ollicitation of &s;ome of you, I make the attempt; yet I fear, I mu&s;t unavoida|bly fail your expectations: there being no more than a few brief hints I can po&s;&s;ibly give you, relative to this &s;ettlement.</P>
<P>However, though we may not pretend &s;o to trace the &s;pecial circum&s;tances of the original and progre&s;s of this town, as from the&s;e alone to collect &s;uitable and &s;ufficient matter for your re|ligious and pious entertainment; yet we <HI>may</HI> from the&s;e, in connection with &s;ome of the ancient things of this country.</P>
<P>And indeed it may not be improper; but both pertinent and profitable, on the pre&s;ent oc|ca&s;ion, to reflect on tho&s;e things which laid the foundation of our pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hment, and from whence have ari&s;en <HI>this</HI> and all other towns and churches through the land.</P>
<P>It has been the practice of God's people in all ages to commemorate the ancient things God hath done for them, and to improve them to re|ligious purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>That this was practi&s;ed by the pious and god|ly among the Jews is evident from the book of p&s;alms, and divers other parts of &s;acred writ, and <HI>particularly</HI> from the words of my text&mdash;"The&s;e are ancient things."</P>
<P>And though we may not &s;o clearly &s;ee, at this di&s;tance of time, what religious purpo&s;es the re|collecting
<PB N="7" REF="013136_0005_0F8EC480DD653520">
and mentioning tho&s;e ancient things, referred to in my text, might &s;erve; yet we may be certain of <HI>this,</HI> that it was &s;ome how &s;erviceable and is &s;o &s;till to the church of God,&mdash;for "all &s;cripture is given by in&s;piration of God, and is profitable for doctrine,&mdash;<HI>for in&s;truc|tion in righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI>"<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. 3. 16.</NOTE></P>
<P>So then without taking any &s;pecial notice of tho&s;e ancient things to which my text refers, I &s;hall make u&s;e of the words to lead your tho'ts and meditations&mdash;to the original, or fir&s;t &s;ettle|ment of this country,&mdash;its ri&s;e and progre&s;s&mdash;and particularly of this town.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, I &s;hall lead your thoughts back to the original or fir&s;t &s;ettlement of this country, and &s;ay &s;omething of the ri&s;e and occa&s;ion of it.</P>
<P>Now in order to know the occa&s;ion of our fore-fathers coming into this part of the world,&mdash;or the rea&s;on of their removing from the land of their nativity to &s;ettle on the&s;e American &s;hores; let it be ob&s;erved,&mdash;That at the begin|ning of the reign of the popi&s;h Queen Mary in England, many of tho&s;e who were &s;incerely en|gaged in the reformation and in ca&s;ting off all the &s;uper&s;titions of Rome, being much alarmed at the furious &s;torm of per&s;ecution which they ap|prehended coming on, fled abroad for &s;afety. And, having opportunity there to ob&s;erve the wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline of foreign churches, ma|ny of them thought that the&s;e churches had car|ried the reformation to a greater degree of per|fection, than had been done in England.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="013136_0006_0F8EC4816DA3CEB0">
Hence, upon their return home, at the happy acce&s;&s;ion of the prote&s;tant Queen Elizabeth to the crown, they became very zealous for a more perfect reformation in the church of England, agreable to what they had &s;een in the prote&s;tant churches abroad. This is the party who were at fir&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of <HI>Puritans,</HI> af|terwards by that of <HI>Nonconformi&s;ts</HI> or <HI>Di&s;ciplinari|ans,</HI> and now u&s;ually of <HI>Pre&s;byterians</HI> or <HI>Di&s;&s;enters.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e good and con&s;ciencious people, though far from being plea&s;ed with many things that were practi&s;ed, and required of them, which ap|peared to them un&s;criptural and rather the com|mandments of men than the appointments of God; yet many of them thought it prudence for the pre&s;ent to continue in the communion of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, and wait for better days: hoping for a further reformation, and that their di&s;cipline and wor&s;hip might in time be brought nearer to the purity and &s;implicity of the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>But after long and fruitle&s;s waiting, finding all attempts un&s;ucce&s;sful for obtaining that re|formation they &s;o earne&s;tly de&s;ired and prayed for, and being very hardly treated in tho&s;e un|happy times becau&s;e they could not &s;ubmit to all things impo&s;ed on them, they were many of them hereby drove to a more open &s;eparation from the things that were by law e&s;tabli&s;hed. And not being &s;uffered peaceably to wor&s;hip God according to the dictates of their own con|&s;ciences in their native country, they &s;ought it a|broad. Some removed into other parts&punc; Eu|rope, and found that comfort in foreign churches which was denied them at home. Others &s;ought
<PB N="9" REF="013136_0007_0F8EC482E7E82408">
a refuge from the &s;torm in &s;ome quiet rece&s;s of America, "Here," as one &s;ays, "they hoped &s;till to enjoy the freedoms and privileges of Eng|li&s;h government and to enlarge the Briti&s;h do|minions: Here they hoped to be the ble&s;&s;ed in|&s;truments of &s;preading the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t among the natives: here they hoped to pro&s;ecute the de&s;ign of a &s;piritual reformation and entail pure religion, with liberty of con&s;cience, as the good|lie&s;t heritage, unto their children in &s;ucceeding generations."</P>
<P>Upon &s;uch excellent views as the&s;e our pious Ance&s;tors tran&s;planted them&s;elves, families and e&s;tates into the&s;e remote regions of the earth. Late in the year 1620, arrived to America tho&s;e good people who laid the foundation of the mo&s;t ancient Church and Colony of Plimouth.</P>
<P>Sometime in June 1629 arrived at Salem,<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">The Indian name was Naumkeak, but now called Salem from that in P&s;alm 72. 2.</NOTE> that mo&s;t ancient town of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, the original &s;ettlers of that part of the country.</P>
<P>In the &s;ummer of 1630 came over tho&s;e who fir&s;t imbodied into church order at Charle&s;town; but the greater part of the&s;e, not very well lik|ing their &s;ituation, removed over to the other &s;ide of Charles-river and &s;ettled the town of Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P>The&s;e fir&s;t &s;ettlers were few in number&mdash;our Fathers were then in a wilderne&s;s-condition; &s;eeing nothing round them but uncultivated wilds
<PB N="10" REF="013136_0008_0F8EC483C915F938">
and &s;avage creatures; di&s;tant a thou&s;and leagues from their native country; enduring various hard&s;hips, wants and &s;traits.</P>
<P>But this pious people thought nothing too much to be done and &s;uffered, for the procuring tho&s;e happy go&s;pel privileges and religious liber|ties, which too many among us at this day make but little account of. And with great labour and fatigue, and no &s;mall expence to them&s;elves (though none to the crown) was it that they &s;ub|dued and &s;ettled this land.</P>
<P>Thus we have &s;een the occa&s;ion and beginning of the &s;ettlement of this country by the Engli&s;h.&mdash;And the&s;e are ancient things.</P>
<P>We are in the next place to give &s;ome brief account of the growth and progre&s;s of it.</P>
<P>Now this country flouri&s;hed under the &s;miles of heaven &s;o remarkably, that it is thought &s;carce any hi&s;tory in the world affords a parallel. It has been remarked by tho&s;e who have under|taken to give us an account of the ri&s;e and pro|gre&s;s of this country by the Engli&s;h, that &s;everal repeated attempts for the &s;ettlement of an Eng|li&s;h plantation in the bay of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, upon worldly views, proved abortive; though under|taken by gentlemen of con&s;iderable powers and e&s;tates, and attended with many &s;ervants. But it plea&s;ed God wonderfully to ble&s;s and di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e who came here upon a religious account, and crown their noble enterprize with glorious &s;ucce&s;s. It was <HI>that</HI> God, who led the tribes of I&s;rael through the &s;ea and the wilderne&s;s, and
<PB N="11" REF="013136_0009_0F8EC48476F44C60">
whom the &s;eas and the winds obey, that conduct|ed our Fathers over the wide and hazardous At|lantic ocean&mdash;that prepared a &s;anctuary for them in this ob&s;cure corner of the earth, and gave them the land of the heathen for an inheri|tance. We have heard with our ears; our fa|thers have told us the&s;e ancient things,&mdash;how God did drive out the heathen and plant them. They got not the land in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion by their own &s;word, nor did their own arm &s;ave them, but his right hand, his holy arm, and the light of his countenance, becau&s;e he had a favor unto them. God's pre&s;ence with our Fathers was their &s;hield, their &s;trength, and defence, and the &s;ource of all their pro&s;perity, temporal and &s;piritual,&mdash;of their external and moral tranquility and happi|ne&s;s. Through the influence of the Spirit of grace, they had not only the form but the power of religion among them: they were in general pious towards God and righteous towards men: And "godline&s;s is profitable unto all things, having the promi&s;e of the life that now is and of that which is to come."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1. Tim. 4. 8.</NOTE> And "righteou&s;ne&s;s exalteth a nation,"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Prov. 14. 34.</NOTE> God ble&s;&s;ed and increa&s;ed them greatly.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">For the above hi&s;torical accounts, &amp;c. I have been oblig|ed to the Rev. Mr. <HI>Prince'</HI>s chronology and the Rev. <HI>Tho|mas Foxcroft'</HI>s hi&s;torical and practical ob&s;ervations on the ri&s;e and primitive &s;tate of <HI>New-England;</HI> but chiefly to the latter: How free an u&s;e I have made of them may be &s;een by peru&s;ing them.</NOTE></P>
<P>And hence aro&s;e in &s;o &s;hort a time &s;o many &s;ettlements and plantations. The people broke forth on the right hand and on the left and di&s;|per&s;ed
<PB N="12" REF="013136_0010_0F8EBA750624AD78">
them&s;elves on all &s;ides. The wilderne&s;s and &s;olitary places became inhabited and the de&s;erts blo&s;&s;omed as the ro&s;e. Towns were mul|tiplied and where there were hideous woods, fields &s;oon appeared white unto harve&s;t.</P>
<P>And this leads us, as was propo&s;ed, to look back to the original plantation and &s;ettlement of <HI>this</HI> town and the churches in it;&mdash;to ob&s;erve &s;ome of the &s;teps of Divine Providence in <HI>our</HI> ri&s;e, growth, and e&s;tabli&s;hment as at this day. I have been careful to obtain as &s;uccinct and ju&s;t an ac|count of the&s;e ancient things as I could, though not altogether &s;uch an one as I &s;hould have been glad to have done. However, what I have col|lected is as follows:</P>
<P>This town&s;hip was originally contained with|in the limits of Dedham. We are told in the Rev. Mr. Dexter's century-&s;ermon&mdash;"that the town of Dedham was the 16th or 18th &s;ettlement from the fir&s;t beginning of the country&mdash;and that the fir&s;t inhabitants of that town came from &s;everal parts of England; few of them known to one another before they came over." And they are &s;aid to have been a &s;erious, godly peo|ple: and I &s;uppo&s;e removed from England into the&s;e parts upon the &s;ame religious principles that others before them had done.</P>
<P>From this place and people originated all, or mo&s;t of the fir&s;t &s;ettlers of this town.</P>
<P>This place, as was &s;aid before, being contain|ed within the limits of Dedham, &s;undry of the inhabitants of that town, after they had been up
<PB N="13" REF="013136_0011_0F8EC485C740A8B0">
to take a view, obtained grants of land here. Several who had obtained &s;uch grants began &s;oon to make improvements upon them: and at length they with others removed their families and &s;ettled here.<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">The fir&s;t Engli&s;h inhabitant in this place, according to our church records, was one Mr Shears.</NOTE></P>
<P>In a few years after this plantation was be|gun, the proprietors applied to the town of Dedham to &s;et them off; which they did March 27th, 1661. About twelve years after this, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> October 15th, 1673, they petitioned the General Court to be e<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ected into a town&s;hip by the name of Wrentham; which name, as I have been informed, was de&s;ired becau&s;e &s;ome of them came from a town of that name in old England. And it appears from the ancient re|cords of this town that their petition was grant|ed and they made a town&s;hip the very &s;ame day they applied to the Court for it:&mdash;and that their de&s;ire was gratified as to the name. This was done about 53 years after the arrival of the fir&s;t Fathers of this country, and ONE HUNDRED YEARS from this day.</P>
<P>There were 16 families here when the town|&s;hip was granted.</P>
<P>That the fir&s;t &s;ettlers of this place were in ge|neral a religious &s;ort of people, and that the truth and ways of God&mdash;mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance and brotherly love were things regarded by them, &s;ome what appears from their petition to Court to be a town&s;hip: but more e&s;pecially from the
<PB N="14" REF="013136_0012_0F8EBA74E19503F0">
covenant of a&s;&s;ociation which they entered into, in their infant &s;tate: and upon the &s;igning of which, as I &s;uppo&s;e, they admitted others to in|corporate with them.</P>
<P>Accordingly, before ever they were erected into a town&s;hip (tho' &s;o few in number) they were careful to have the word of God regularly preach|ed to them, and procured Mr. Samuel Man,<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Mr. Samuel Man, I am told, was born in Cambridge, and was graduated at Harvard College in the year 1665.</NOTE> a young candidate, for this purpo&s;e: not being willing to live like the heathen tho' they dwelt in the wilderne&s;s. This worthy and pious Gen|tleman continued to di&s;pen&s;e the word of God to them till March 30th, 1676; when the inha|bitants were obliged to draw off by rea&s;on of an Indian war.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">This was Phillip's war, an Indian Sachem or King at Mount-Hope, now Bri&s;tol.</NOTE> This was a little more than two years and an half after they had been made a town&s;hip.</P>
<P>Through the preventing goodne&s;s of God and their &s;ea&s;onable withdraw, no lives were cut off by the heathen. However, the enemy came up|on the town after they were gone, and burnt all their dwellings except two,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">What &s;aved the&s;e two dwellings from the flames was their being infected with the &s;mall-pox, of which the Indi|ans by &s;ome means or other had gotten information.</NOTE> if my informati|on has been good. We can none of us think but this mu&s;t be very di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to tho&s;e new beginners, although the bitter cup was &s;weetned with the con&s;ideration that no life was lo&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="013136_0013_0F8EC486644D22F8">
After the Indian war was over, or at lea&s;t the heat of it abated, I find a number (I &s;uppo&s;e the greater part) engaging them&s;elves to return by a written in&s;trument with their names affixed thereunto.<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot"><P>This may be &s;een in the ancient records of this town.

</LIST></NOTE> And becau&s;e it &s;eems to indicate &s;omething of their pious and good temper of mind, I &s;hall take the liberty of tran&s;cribing a few words, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR>&mdash;"We the &s;ub&s;cribers&mdash;having formerly had our re&s;idence in Wrentham, but by tho&s;e &s;ad and &s;olemn di&s;pen&s;ations of God's providence were removed: yet de&s;iring that a work for the honor of God and the good and comfort of our&s;elves and ours might be a|gain engaged in, and promoted at that place: therefore our purpo&s;e is to return thither, God willing," &amp;c.</P>
<P>So great was their veneration for Mr. Man, and &s;o acceptable had been his labors among them, that it was their earne&s;t de&s;ire he &s;hould return with them. Accordingly they cho&s;e and &s;ent a committee to treat with him about it. Mr. Man, as I have been informed, was then preaching at Milton, and already had a call to &s;ettle in the work of the mini&s;try there, or Mil|ton people were about to give him one. But &s;o great was his affection for the people of Wren|tham, and &s;o de&s;irous was he of that plantation's
<PB N="16" REF="013136_0014_0F8EC487452E6E68">
going on, that he complied with their reque&s;t. Accordingly, he and divers of the inhabitants returned to Wrentham again,. Aug. 21&s;t, 1680, four years and &s;ome months after they drew off on account of the Indian war.</P>
<P>In the year 1681, the inhabitants of this Town agreed to erect an hou&s;e for the public wor&s;hip of God, before the year 1684. And probably between the&s;e dates the fir&s;t meeting-hou&s;e was built.</P>
<P>Mr. Man continued di&s;pen&s;ing the word to them, though not ordained over them, till the year 1692; in which year, on the 13th day of April, a Church was gathered here; con&s;i&s;ting of ten members (including Mr. Man) who imbodi|ed in church fellow&s;hip by &s;olemn covenant. And Mr. Man was ordained over the church and congregation the &s;ame day.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He preached his own ordination-&s;ermon, from 1 Cor. IV. 2.</NOTE></P>
<P>Whether it were the difficulties they had to conflict with in their infancy, or what was the rea&s;on that it was &s;o long after their incorporati|on, before a church was gathered and Mr. Man ordained, I am not able to &s;ay: but it was more than eighteen years.</P>
<P>In the year 1719, on May 22d, our church-re|cords &s;ay, "that the Rev. Samuel Man gave up the gho&s;t, in the 72d year of his age." And by a private record put into my hands by one of the pari&s;h,&mdash;he died in the 49th year of his
<PB N="17" REF="013136_0015_0F8EC4876416A5C0">
faithful mini&s;try; &s;o it is expre&s;&s;ed. But this mu&s;t be under&s;tood as including all the time he preached in this place before his ordination: for from <HI>that</HI> to his death was but about twenty|&s;even years.</P>
<P>By what I have heard of him he was a man of good erudition and an accompli&s;hed preach|er, pious and faithful.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One of the fir&s;t men, if not the fir&s;t, in this Province, and who was e&s;teemed a good judge of the powers and a|bilities of men, &s;aid of Mr. Man that "he was not only a very <HI>good,</HI> but a very <HI>great</HI> and <HI>learned</HI> man."</NOTE> He lived greatly be|loved of his people and died greatly lamented by them. But chri&s;tian charity obliges us to think that <HI>their</HI> lo&s;s was infinitely <HI>his</HI> gain.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">He left a numerous Po&s;terity, and many of his de&s;cen|dants are now among us.</NOTE></P>
<P>After the death of Mr. Man the church and congregation here were de&s;titute of a pa&s;tor a|bout &s;even months; when this breach was made up in the happy &s;ettlement of the Rev. Henry Me&s;&s;inger, who was ordained to the pa&s;toral office December 5th, 1719.</P>
<P>About two years after his ordination, in the year 1721, the &s;econd hou&s;e for the public wor|&s;hip of God was built in this place, larger and more commodious than the former. Hither, to this &s;econd erected hou&s;e did all the tribes of the Lord, or in other words all the people in the town repair to wor&s;hip, 'till Augu&s;t 29th, 1737: when by the good hand of God upon them they were &s;o multiplied, pro&s;pered and &s;ucceeded, that

they became two bands; for the people of the we&s;t part of the town, at their reque&s;t, were then &s;et off into a di&s;tinct pari&s;h by them&s;elves. The brethren being di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from this church here, were formed into a new church-body there, February 16th, 1738. And the Rev. Elias Ha|ven was unanimou&s;ly called to &s;ettle in the work of the &s;acred mini&s;try among them on the 23d of March following: and was &s;olemnly ordain|ed over them on the 8th day of November, the &s;ame year.</P>
<P>Mr. Me&s;&s;inger continued in this fir&s;t pari&s;h, greatly labouring in word and doctrine, till it plea&s;ed the Sovereign Lord of life and death to put a period to his life and work nearly toge|ther.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">He was confined but a few days, and I think preached the &s;abbath, or the &s;abbath but one before his death.</NOTE> And when he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his faith|ful labours here below, we tru&s;t he was received to his glorious reward above; and that no in|con&s;iderable number of his flock and others will be his joy and crown in the day of Chri&s;t's appearing.</P>
<P>He departed this life March 30th, 1750, in the 55th year of his age, and 32d year of his faithful mini&s;try.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">He was a gentleman of unblemi&s;hed reputation, and highly e&s;teemed for his piety and virtue.

<P>The Rev. Elias Haven, pa&s;tor of the we&s;t pa|ri&s;h, was taken off from his mini&s;terial labours by bodily weakne&s;s, contracting a con&s;umptive habit, for &s;everal years, and was able to preach but very little during that time,<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">I think Mr. Haven preached but very &s;eldom for five or &s;ix years or more before his death.&mdash;And I would re|cord it to the honor of that people, that they procured preach|ing mo&s;t of that time at their own charge, or with but very little expence to their pa&s;tor, and allowed him the whole, or mo&s;t of his annual &s;tipend, till he removed to that world where we tru&s;t he is now reaping better than tho&s;e carnal things.</NOTE> to the no &s;mall afflic|tion of his pari&s;hioners who were thereby de|prived of his excellent &s;ermons and other per|formances, which they were very pa&s;&s;ionately fond of.</P>
<P>After ineffectual endeavors for the recovery of his health by change of air, u&s;e of medicine, and an exact regimen, he fell a prey to that di&s;|order, and departed this life Augu&s;t 10th, 1754, in the 41&s;t year of his age and 16th of his mi|ni&s;try.

<P>Let us now endeavor to improve the ancient things we have been reflecting upon to the pur|po&s;es of religion and devotion. With &s;uch a view as this it was, that God's people of old &s;o often called to mind and reflected on the anci|ent things God had done for his church many years, and centuries of years, after tho&s;e wonders were performed,&mdash;as their remarkable deliver|ance from the Egyptian bondage&mdash;the miracu|lous dividing of the red &s;ea for the ran&s;omed tribes to pa&s;s through&mdash;their miraculous pre&s;er|vation in the wilderne&s;s forty years, when God fed them with manna and gave them of the corn of heaven, till their introduction and &s;ettlement in the land of Canaan, which prepared the way for their future e&s;tabli&s;hment and pro&s;perity.

<PB N="25" REF="013136_0023_0F8EC493805CF4E0">
to our&s;elves in a&s;&s;embling this day and on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion at the hou&s;e of God, and re|flecting on tho&s;e ancient things that have been hinted in this di&s;cour&s;e. And indeed, if our hearts be rightly di&s;po&s;ed, we may improve them in general to our &s;piritual advantage and benefit.&mdash;Let us then in the fear of God endeavor to do it. And here,</P>
<P N="1">1. Let what has been &s;aid of the ancient things of this town and country &s;erve to humble us, by con&s;idering the meanne&s;s of our begin|ning as to externals, yet the glory thereof as to &s;pirituals, which &s;piritual glory is now very much lo&s;t, as is thought, in the increa&s;e of our temporal comforts. Have we not great rea&s;on to humble our&s;elves under the decay of vital pie|ty?&mdash;How is the gold become dim and the mo&s;t fine gold changed! Where is the primitive faith, zeal, and purity of our Fathers! What will it avail us that we have, (or rather <HI>once</HI> had) a great name for religion, and have been &s;poken of as a people among whom &s;obriety, righteou&s;|ne&s;s, and godline&s;s have flouri&s;hed above ma|ny others, if tho&s;e dignifying excellencies have taken wing! If our pre&s;ent character falls &s;hort of our ancient one, and we have degenera|ted from the virtues of our Ance&s;tors, we have greater cau&s;e for <HI>&s;hame</HI> than for glorying in what we have been. How many among us in this place and through the land have corrupted their ways and for&s;aken the Lord God of their Fathers! And how are we &s;tained with the mo&s;t odious vices, &s;uch as uncleanne&s;s, drunken|ne&s;s, theft, violence, malice, &s;trife, profanene&s;s,
<PB N="26" REF="013136_0024_0F8EC4946AADD7A0">
and others! As to profane language, though the hi&s;tories of this country will inform us, that in its fir&s;t and pure&s;t times there was &s;carce a profane oath heard in the land, yet now how common, how <HI>very</HI> common is cur&s;ing and &s;wearing among us! and this not only in our &s;ea-port towns, where it was once very much confined, but in our inland towns, and pari&s;hes, and, this vice like a contagious di&s;temper, &s;preads through the provinces; &s;o that even children in age are heard to take the tremendous name of God in vain, and to &s;peak the horrid and &s;hock|ing dialect or language of hell. Awful degene|racy this!</P>
<P>It is granted that there are many &s;incerely pious and godly per&s;ons in this land, and we hope a con&s;iderable number in this town, who in de&s;pite of all temptations and evil ex|amples hold fa&s;t their righteou&s;ne&s;s&mdash;maintain|ing a life of devotion towards God, and ju&s;tice towards men&mdash;&s;hining thereby as lights in the world in the mid&s;t of a crooked and perver&s;e na|tion. This I &s;ay we acknowlege to the glory of God, and ble&s;s Him for it. But then if we compare our&s;elves in general with the fir&s;t Fathers of this land (though we are far from pretending that <HI>they</HI> were perfect) how va&s;tly &s;hort do we come of their bright example! Does it not appear that we want their ardent love to God, his truths and ways&mdash;their peaceable, healing, loving, friendly, benevolent &s;pirit?</P>
<P>I am di&s;po&s;ed to think that &s;ome of the aged in Wrentham, and who are pre&s;ent in this a&s;|&s;embly, can remember when there was more
<PB N="27" REF="013136_0025_0F8EC495151B2AF0">
peace, love, and friend&s;hip in this town than there is at this day&mdash;when the inhabitants ap|peared to regard and treat one another more like brethren&mdash;and contentious law-&s;uits were &s;eldom known among them.</P>
<P>But to return. Do we not very much want their humility and &s;elf-denial&mdash;their generous contempt of this world&mdash;their &s;trong faith and affecting views of the world to come! How many defects are there in the manner of our conduct&mdash;in the &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s of our deportment&mdash;in our chri&s;tian prudence, faithfulne&s;s, and diligence! Now all this &s;hould &s;erve to hum|ble us.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let our reflections on the ancient things of this town and country excite us to give God the glory of his wonderful works in the days of our Fathers. It is certain God did great things and marvellous for them in their fir&s;t plantation and &s;ettlement in this country, when it was a land not &s;own, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by cruel &s;avages. Our Fathers &s;aw the hand and work of God and were glad, and they gave glory to Him. They &s;pake often one to another of the&s;e things to the prai&s;e of God and their mutual edification and comfort. And it becomes <HI>us</HI> the po&s;terity of tho&s;e good people who bore the heat and bur|den of the day, to &s;peak of them to the glory of God as well as they. God was plea&s;ed to vi&s;it the natives of this land with a terrible &s;ickne&s;s (of what nature or kind we are not able to &s;ay) which cut off multitudes of them; and with wa&s;ting wars among them&s;elves, in which many peri&s;hed before the arrival of the Engli&s;h into
<PB N="28" REF="013136_0026_0F8EC495C2E6E798">
the&s;e parts, whereby room was made for them. And it plea&s;ed God in a very extraordinary manner to introduce and &s;ettle this &s;mall num|ber of people on this &s;trange and di&s;tant &s;hore&mdash;to pre&s;erve and e&s;tabli&s;h them, by a &s;e|ries of kind and powerful providences, in the mid&s;t of a great variety of di&s;tre&s;&s;ing difficulties and dangers&mdash;and enable them to do what may now appear &s;urpri&s;ing to us, con&s;idering their circum&s;tances, in their infant &s;tate and &s;ettle|ments. It is but rea&s;onable therefore that we &s;hould give to God the glory of it.&mdash;The&s;e works belong to the hi&s;tory of Divine Provi|dence, which God would have known and read of all men; and ju&s;tly expects that we &s;hould prai&s;e him for them.</P>
<P N="3">3. Let our reflections on tho&s;e ancient things that have been mentioned, &s;erve to make us pa|tient and re&s;igned to the will of God, under all our &s;traits and difficulties. The uncommon &s;ufferings and hard&s;hips our Progenitors endur|ed, in their weari&s;ome pilgrimage in this wilder|ne&s;s, in their going into the woods to make new &s;ettlements, &s;hould not only endear their memory to us, as we reap the fruits of their labours, but alleviate the pre&s;&s;ure of our own troubles and prevent all murmurs and complaints. What are our &s;traits and wants to what &s;ome of them had to encounter with! They were in perils by rob|bers, in perils by their own country men, in perils by the heathen, in perils&punc; in the wilderne&s;s, in perils in the &s;ea&mdash;in wearine&s;s and painfulne&s;s, in watchings often, in hunger and thir&s;t, in fa&s;tings often, in cold and nakedne&s;s. It may be of &s;er|vice to us, my hearers, to think &s;ometimes of
<PB N="29" REF="013136_0027_0F8EC49672E484C8">
the&s;e things, e&s;pecially when our commons &s;eem &s;hort, and we think our fare cour&s;e and hard, and begin to be impatient and unea&s;y. It might be of u&s;e to check &s;uch an ill temper at its fir&s;t ri&s;ing, to con&s;ider the &s;traits and difficulties of our Fa|thers, who &s;ometimes had not a mor&s;el of bread, but were obliged to dig up certain roots for their &s;u&s;tenance: &amp; when they could procure the&s;e, &amp; a few &s;hell-fi&s;h,<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ground-Nuts and Clams,</NOTE> they were contented and chear|ful, giving God thanks. And indeed we have rea&s;on to think that the fir&s;t &s;ettlers of this town were far from affluent circum&s;tances. When they came up here, it was not with any hopes to enter into other men's labours and build on foun|dations already laid. No, they came expecting neither hou&s;es prepared for their reception, nor gardens, fields, or orchards for their entertain|ment;&mdash;but a wilderne&s;s, where they expected to get their bread not only with the &s;weat of their brows, but even with the peril of their lives on account of the heathen.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">I have been told they were obliged &s;ometimes to car|ry their fire-arms into the field when they went to works and to the hou&s;e of God when they went to wor&s;hip.</NOTE> We are not to ima|gine that they had the comforts of life in &s;uch plenty as we have. They were obliged to rub very hard, as we &s;ay, to &s;upport them&s;elves and families and procure what they left to you their children. So then if at any time you are di&s;po|&s;ed to murmur at your lot, and repine becau&s;e you are not in &s;o plentiful circum&s;tances as &s;ome others&mdash;remember your Ance&s;tors.</P>
<P N="4">4. Let our reflections on tho&s;e ancient, me|morable things God hath done for our Fathers,
<PB N="30" REF="013136_0028_0F8EC497834F8CA8">
&s;erve to encourage our faith and hope in God, who is &s;till the &s;ame powerful and gracious Be|ing as ever, and ready to appear for all tho&s;e who truly &s;eek him.</P>
<P>Our Fathers were many times brought into pre&s;&s;ing difficulties&mdash;&s;ometimes thick and dark clouds rolled over them&mdash;the a&s;pect of things appeared black and gloomy, but they tru&s;ted in God, and he &s;oon di&s;&s;ipated the threatening ap|pearances. In <HI>their</HI> affliction <HI>He</HI> was afflicted, and the Angel of his pre&s;ence &s;aved them. There was a time &s;omething &s;imilar to the pre&s;ent, when our Fathers were threatened, more than threatened, to be deprived of their civil liberties and privileges: but they called upon God in their trouble and He delivered them. And he is the &s;ame God &s;till, for he changeth not&mdash;as powerful, as good, and as kind as ever. Let us then &s;eek and &s;erve the God of our Fathers and tru&s;t in his mercy, and we may hope that he will appear for <HI>us</HI> as he did for them, and &s;till &s;ecure to us our invaluable privileges.</P>
<P N="5">5. Let our reflections on the ancient things that have been mentioned remind us of the great errand of our Ance&s;tors into this wilderne&s;s&mdash;the &s;piritual and noble ends of that great under|taking which brought them over to America, and induced the fir&s;t Fathers of <HI>this place</HI> to at|tempt to &s;ettle it. It was the advancement of the glory of God and their own &s;piritual intere&s;t&punc; in the unmole&s;ted enjoyment of the pure ordi|nances and wor&s;hip of God, that brought our An|ce&s;tors into this quarter of the world. And you may remember it was ob&s;erved that the fir&s;t &s;ett|lers
<PB N="31" REF="013136_0029_0F8EC497EA9CFB38">
of this town profe&s;&s;ed that they had religion in their view, and that their de&s;ire to do a work for the honor of God was one principal thing that in|duced them to remove here and plant this place. Now, we &s;hould pur&s;ue their glorious de&s;ign and build on their foundation.</P>
<P N="6">6. Let our reflections upon the piety and virtue of the ancient &s;ettlers of this country and town excite in us a care of imitating their pious examples. We &s;hould be excited to this by a &s;en&s;e of peculiar obligations lying on us, as we are the de&s;cendants of &s;uch pious Ance&s;tors, who&s;e names will be a reproach to us if we do not al&s;o inherit their virtues: and we &s;hall de|&s;erve &s;uch an upbraiding expo&s;tulation as that in Jer. 2. 21. "Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right &s;eed: how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a &s;trange vine unto me?" Many were the prayers our godly Predece&s;&s;ors put up for us&mdash;&s;olemn the charges, and very amiable the examples they have left us: all which will ri&s;e up in judgment again&s;t us if we for&s;ake the God of our Fathers.</P>
<P>But to apply what has been &s;aid more particu|larly to our&s;elves the inhabitants of this town.</P>
<P>Your Fathers, where are they? They are gone, long ago gone to their long home. But, thro' the kind indulgence of heaven and the ten|der mercies of our God, the children of his &s;er|vants continue, and their &s;eed is e&s;tabli&s;hed be|fore him: &s;o that in&s;tead of the fathers are the children. And notwith&s;tanding this town, as well as other places, hath been under a variety
<PB N="32" REF="013136_0030_0F8EC49999CFC9C0">
of di&s;pen&s;ations, and God hath vi&s;ited you &s;eve|ral times with moral &s;ickne&s;&s;es, whereby many, both old and young, have been taken from a|mong you&mdash;and &s;ome very u&s;eful per&s;ons in town and church, and the mourners have gone about the &s;treets; yet God hath be&s;towed innu|merable kindne&s;&s;es upon us; and of late we have not had any times of great mortality a|mong us.</P>
<P>We &s;ee how God hath increa&s;ed us. Can we then ever ju&s;tify our conduct if we ca&s;t Him off? Shall we not be guilty of the greate&s;t ingratitude if we thus requite our own and our fathers God? In&s;tead of doing this, let us follow our Fathers wherein they followed Chri&s;t. And whatever appears to have been commendable and prai&s;e|worthy in their characters, when held up to view, let us endeavor to copy and imitate.</P>
<P>They, we have heard, had &s;uch a ta&s;te and reli&s;h for the word of God preached, that they would not content them&s;elves without having it publicly and regularly di&s;pen&s;ed unto them, even when there were no more than &s;ixteen families, and probably not &s;o many.<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">Mr. Man preached with them a con&s;iderable time, if I mi&s;take not one or two years or more, before they were erected into a town&s;hip: and there being no more than &s;ixteen families when they were incorporated, it makes it greatly probable that there were not &s;o many when Mr. Man came fir&s;t to preach among them.</NOTE> And now, al|lowing that &s;ome who lived in Dedham and had rights of land here bore part of the charge that they were at in providing preaching among them, yet the weight of the expence mu&s;t have
<PB N="33" REF="013136_0031_0F8EBA7402970E30">
been heavy, there being &s;o few to bear it. How|ever, by all I can collect from the town records, they bore it <HI>chearfully,</HI> and cho&s;e rather to pinch their bodies than &s;tarve their &s;ouls&mdash;and to put them&s;elves to &s;ome temporal inconveniences than not to have the word of &s;alvation preached unto them.</P>
<P>Let us then after their example highly e&s;teem, give diligent attendance upon, and make con|&s;cientious improvement of all the means of grace.</P>
<P>They were careful to &s;et up religion in their families, and offered up their morning and even|ing-&s;acrifice of prayer and thank&s;giving to God, with reading the holy &s;criptures. May we, all of us, follow them in this. And let there not be one prayerle&s;s family among us, nor one hou&s;e wherein the written word of God is not daily read.</P>
<P>Like them may we in&s;truct our children and &s;ervants in the things of God and Chri&s;t, and in the duties of religion;&mdash;and &s;et pious ex|amples before them.</P>
<P>And oh! that God would pour out his Spirit upon his &s;ervants and his ble&s;&s;ing upon our off|&s;pring!&mdash;and by his Spirit and power turn the hearts, both of parents and children, unto the Lord God of our Fathers, and the di&s;obedient to the wi&s;dom of the ju&s;t, to make ready a peo|ple prepared of the Lord!</P>
<P>I would addre&s;s the young people and chil|dren of this town in the &s;olemn language of Da|vid
<PB N="34" REF="013136_0032_0F8EC49A5B404D98">
in his dying charge to his &s;on. "And thou Solomon my &s;on, know thou the God of thy Father, and &s;erve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind&mdash;if thou &s;eek him he will be found of thee; but if thou for&s;ake him, he will ca&s;t thee off for-ever."<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">1 Chron. 28. 9</NOTE> You are, young people and children, <HI>particularly</HI> concerned in what has been delivered. It is agreable to the will of God that we &s;hould acquaint you with the&s;e ancient things: Not indeed to amu&s;e you with ancient &s;tories, but for your &s;piritual profit and advantage.</P>
<P>Thus we find God commanding his people I&s;rael to tran&s;mit the knowledge of what He had done for them, down to all their generations&mdash;that "one generation might prai&s;e his works to another, and declare his mighty acts&mdash;that the generation to come might know them, even the children which &s;hould be born: who &s;hould a|ri&s;e and declare them to their children: that they might &s;et their hope in God, and not for|get the works of God; but keep his command|ments."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm 145. 4. and 78. 6, 7.</NOTE></P>
<P>For the&s;e purpo&s;es and ends we declare to you the ancient things God hath done for your Fathers in their day. And as they, in the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of this town, had a view to you their de&s;cendants,&mdash;had a care that extended to the late&s;t po&s;terity,&mdash;and &s;ought a godly &s;eed: may you be concerned that you be &s;uch a &s;eed in reality!&mdash;&s;uch every way as they wi&s;hed and prayed for! And let us your immediate parents have the comfort and joy of &s;eeing you our chil|dren
<PB N="35" REF="013136_0033_0F8EC49D19B75408">
walking in the truth;&mdash;and have this to refre&s;h our &s;pirits before we quit the&s;e mortal a|bodes, that we &s;hall leave tho&s;e behind us, who will keep the ways of the Lord and not wickedly depart from our God.</P>
<P>To the aged of this town let me &s;ay; as your venerable years entitle you to that re&s;pect and reverence from the ri&s;ing generation, which was paid to your Fathers by the younger &s;ort in their day; &s;o if you would be in favor with God and honored by the youth, you mu&s;t, like your An|ce&s;tors, be "&s;ober, grave, temperate, &s;ound in faith, in charity, in patience." And be <HI>&s;hining</HI> examples of piety and virtue.</P>
<P>And as the fir&s;t inhabitants of this town, by what I can collect from records and traditional accounts, &s;tudied union among them&s;elves&mdash;liv|ed in harmony, and like the builders of Jeru&s;a|lem, &s;trengthened one anothers hands for the good work they came here upon: let us imitate them in this, and all of us "follow after the things which make for peace, and things where|with one may edify another." May the God of peace unite us all in the bonds of truth, holine&s;s and love! May He give us one heart and one way that we may fear him for ever; for the good of our&s;elves and our children after us!</P>
<P>In a word, let us begin our &s;econd Century with new and better frames, tempers, and re&s;o|lutions than we have ever had, and make it our con&s;tant and zealous endeavor, to expre&s;s a grateful &s;en&s;e of divine favours in the virtues and prai&s;es of a life devoted to God. This let
<PB N="36" REF="013136_0034_0F8EC49D2C0495D0">
us do as a cho&s;en generation, a peculiar people &s;hewing forth the prai&s;es of him who hath called us out of darkne&s;s into the marvellous light and liberty of the go&s;pel&mdash;commanding our chil|dren, and hou&s;holds to keep the way of the Lord, that the Lord may abundantly ble&s;s us in all our generations.</P>
<P>To conclude, May every one of us in this A&s;&s;embly be formed by the Spirit of holine&s;s for the &s;ervice of God here, while we remain in the body; and for the full and compleat enjoyment of him in the world of &s;pirits! And when that great and mighty Angel, &s;poken of in the book of the Revelation, &s;hall proclaim that time &s;hall be no longer,&mdash;&s;trike off the wheels of nature, and bid centuries and generations cea&s;e to roll; may our &s;ouls be reunited to our rai&s;ed bodies <HI>gloriou&s;ly</HI> formed, and we, in body and &s;oul, pa&s;s into a &s;tate of undecaying felicity; where nei|ther days, nor years, nor centuries of years, but <HI>eternity</HI> will be the mea&s;ure of the duration of our happine&s;s! Where, among other delightful exerci&s;es, we &s;hall (very probably) with exalted &s;trains of rapture and devotion, trace the hi&s;tory of Divine Providence, and call to mind the an|cient things of the works of God for his church and people thro' all the generations of time&mdash;everla&s;tingly celebrate the prai&s;es of him who is the Ancient of days for the&s;e his wonderful works to the children of men&mdash;and admire the &s;ur|pri&s;ing di&s;plays of the wi&s;dom, power, and good|ne&s;s of the Godhead in them all!</P>
