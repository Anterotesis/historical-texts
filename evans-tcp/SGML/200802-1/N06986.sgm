<HEAD>A SERMON ON Prov. X<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">I.32. HE THAT IS SLOW TO ANGER, IS BETTER THAN THE MIGHTY: AND HE THAT RULETH HIS SPIRIT, THAN HE THAT TAKETH A CITY.</HEAD>
<P>_THE author of the&s;e proverbs appears to have been greatly acquainted with men, and deep|ly &s;tudied in civil policy. He knew the &s;prings of action in the human mind, and how to touch them in the mo&s;t delicate manner. He po&s;&s;e&s;s'd in a &s;uperior degree, "the wi&s;dom from above, which is pure and peaceable." In an&s;wer to his judicious prayer God gave him "a wi&s;e and under&s;tanding heart." Some valuable fruits of his wi&s;dom may be gathered by us, if we
<PB N="6" REF="008878_0004_10309C4F280F62E8">
duly attend to his important maxims, and the excellent rules for the government of our hearts and lives, which are &s;cattered thro' his writings. In them vulgar errors are corrected; fal&s;e great|ne&s;s is di&s;covered; and the way to true honor and happine&s;s marked out.</P>
<P>THE ver&s;e, which is to be the foundation of our pre&s;ent di&s;cour&s;e, teaches us to judge properly of actions and characters; in&s;tructs us not to be dazzled with tho&s;e that wear the fal&s;e glitter of heroi&s;m and magnanimity, while we overlook tho&s;e that are truly noble and im|portant, in "the judgment which is according to truth." <HI>He that is &s;low to anger, is better than the mighty: and he that ruleth his &s;pirit, than he that taketh a city.</HI></P>
<P>IN di&s;cour&s;ing from the&s;e words, I &s;hall endeavour&mdash;To open and explain the cha|racters which we find in them,&mdash;To com|pare them together, that we may &s;ee how much preferable the one is to the other&mdash;And&mdash; To animate all to pur&s;ue them with a zeal proportionate to their re&s;pective importance.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="008878_0005_10309C520ACF3640">IN &s;peaking of the&s;e points, &s;ome things may be &s;aid not altogether foreign to the pre|&s;ent occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE explanation of the characters in our text is fir&s;t to be attempted.</P>
<P>TO be <HI>&s;low to anger,</HI> and to <HI>rule the &s;pirit,</HI> I take to be parts of the &s;ame character; tho' not de&s;criptive of preci&s;ely the &s;ame temper. <HI>The former</HI> may refer, partly at lea&s;t, to the na|tural make and frame of the mind, as having le&s;s warmth and fire, le&s;s propen&s;ity to wrath and pa&s;&s;ion, than is frequently found in &s;ome. That there is &s;uch a difference ob&s;ervable in per&s;ons, before education or religion have had any influence upon them, I &s;uppo&s;e will not be di&s;puted. An enquiry into the rea&s;ons of this difference, is be&s;ide my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e. <HI>The latter,</HI> namely, <HI>to rule the &s;pirit,</HI> may point out a mind, bro't under the government of religion and the word of God, by the pow|er of mighty rea&s;on and almighty grace, what|ever the original con&s;titution might be.</P>
<P>THE man who de&s;erves the character of one that rules his &s;pirit, I take to be nece&s;&s;arily
<PB N="8" REF="008878_0006_10309C54EA8D6EC0">
a man of religion; who is "renewed in the &s;pirit of his mind, after the image of him that created him"; who has the fear of God ruling in his heart; who acts from the noble principles of piety and goodne&s;s; who is go|verned, in all his conduct, by a &s;acred regard to the Deity. The man that acts up to this cha|racter, has put on Chri&s;t, and po&s;&s;e&s;t him&s;elf of the genius of his go&s;pel. The inferior powers of the mind, &s;o apt to rebel, are brought under the influence of rea&s;on and religion, which ought to bear rule. Rea&s;on, who&s;e influence is &s;o weak in the lives of many, in him rea&s;&s;umes her rightful authority, and gains obedience to her laws. And rea&s;on herein acts like her&s;elf, in not building too great dependance on her own native &s;trength and vigor; but thankfully re|ceives the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of divine revelation; "makes the word of God the man of her coun&s;el at all times"; and freely &s;ubmits to the govern|ment thereof.</P>
<P>SUCH principles, deeply wrought into the heart by &s;anctifying grace, will enable a man properly to rule his &s;pirit; and nothing &s;hort hereof will be effectual to do it, to any con|&s;iderable degree. Indeed the more extravagant
<PB N="9" REF="008878_0007_10309C57F68B1E98">
actings of a turbulent &s;pirit, and the more dire|ful effects of pride and pa&s;&s;ion, cruelty and re|venge, may be generally &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by lower motives; &s;uch as a regard to decency, and re|putation among men of &s;ober minds; and a fear of penal laws. But tho' the&s;e external re&s;traints may &s;erve thus far, yet the re&s;tle&s;s &s;pirit, prevented from its natural exertion upon others, will prey upon the man him&s;elf, and produce &s;trange mi&s;ery and confu&s;ion in his brea&s;t: and if the&s;e feebler re&s;traints were taken off, pa&s;&s;ion and anger would be, like the break|ing forth of waters, fierce and impetuous, and deal de&s;truction all around.</P>
<P>THE man who duly rules his &s;pirit, has a full belief and abiding &s;en&s;e, of the moral go|vernment of God; and that him&s;elf is a &s;ub|ject of this government. His own will he knows ought to be ruled by the divine plea&s;ure; and his conduct by the divine laws. And what he knows to be right he de&s;ires &s;hould take place upon him: accordingly he endeavours his &s;pirit &s;hould be entirely "in &s;ubjection to the father of &s;pirits". This view of things has a powerful influence to keep his mind calm and &s;erene under all circum&s;tances of life; and
<PB N="10" REF="008878_0008_10309C5B09D3BF40">
amid&s;t the various a&s;pects of providence. Like <HI>St. Paul,</HI>
<Q>he knows both how to be aba&s;ed, and how to abound; and learns, in what|&s;oever &s;tate he is, therewith to be content.</Q></P>
<P>I MEAN not to intimate, that the &s;pirit of &s;uch an one lo&s;es its activity and &s;prightline&s;s; and becomes dull and unperforming. Far from this,&mdash;he has life and zeal to pur&s;ue every article of known duty: not a blind ill-guided zeal, which leads him headlong; but that which is according to knowledge. He has courage and re&s;olution enough to enterpri&s;e great things; and a greatne&s;s of &s;oul which gives him &s;erenity in the event, whatever it be. He does not run mad with pride when his wi&s;hes &s;ucceed; nor de&s;pond when his hopes are bla&s;ted. Joy and &s;orrow, hope and fear, do not put him out of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his own mind; but prove proper &s;prings of action, as they were de&s;igned to be; and he learns "in patience to po&s;&s;e&s;s his &s;oul".</P>
<P>WHEN the God of providence &s;miles up|on him, and cau&s;es his goodne&s;s to pa&s;s before him, he does not wax wanton, and riot in the kindne&s;&s;es of his heavenly father; but u&s;es
<PB N="11" REF="008878_0009_10309C5DE7E1CB08">
them with &s;obriety and moderation; and feels the generous flame of gratitude kindle in his brea&s;t towards him "from whom comes down every good and every perfect gift." When &s;orrows and afflictions, heavy and numerous, overtake him, and many of his deare&s;t outward enjoyments are taken away, he calmly &s;ubmits to the will of heaven; and learns meekly to &s;ay, as an afflicted &s;ervant of God once did, "The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away, and ble&s;&s;ed be the name of the Lord. None of the&s;e things greatly move him; his heart is fixed, tru&s;ting in the Lord."</P>
<P>MUCH the &s;ame compo&s;ure of mind accom|panies him thro' the trials which he meets with more immediately from the hands of his fellow|men. Kindne&s;s and benevolence are the habi|tual temper of his mind towards tho&s;e who af|front and injure him. In one in&s;tance he &s;i|lently pities them under the power of their un|governed pa&s;&s;ions, and is grieved to &s;ee them indulging to malevolence and ill-will; and th&ocirc; in another he may manife&s;t re&s;entment, he does &s;o only when re&s;entment is agreeable to rea&s;on and the go&s;pel; and likely to advance the good of tho&s;e that abu&s;e him. The calm exerci&s;e of
<PB N="12" REF="008878_0010_10309C60C59031C0">
rea&s;on &s;traitens or relaxes the reins of his pa&s;&s;i|ons; and he learns what is very difficult, "to be angry and not &s;in." Such is the man who is <HI>&s;low to anger, and rules his &s;pirit.</HI></P>
<P>THE other character in our text comes next under our con&s;ideration. <HI>The mighty&mdash;he that taketh a city.</HI></P>
<P>THESE words point out a man of &s;trength and vigor, able to bear the fatigues of war, and ready to face the dangers of battle; one who&s;e con&s;titution is &s;trong, and his fibres braced; one who has &s;ucceeded in military attempts, has been victorious in warfare, and borne a part in the conque&s;t of a defenced city. To rai&s;e the cha|racter &s;till higher, let us &s;uppo&s;e him to be com|mander in chief in &s;ome important expedition. Let us con&s;ider him as enduring the hard&s;hips, and bidding defiance to the dangers of the campaign, as vigorou&s;ly pur&s;uing the plan of operation, 'til he has led his forces into the &s;trong city, and victory crowns his endeavours.</P>
<P>THESE things &s;et a man in a di&s;tingui&s;hed point of light, and draw a train of admirers. The vanqui&s;hed fear and tremble; the
<PB N="13" REF="008878_0011_10309C63A66CCAC0">
multitude &s;hout applau&s;e. This character at lea&s;t appears re&s;pectable; and really is &s;o, when there is nothing to detract from the honor and u&s;efulne&s;s of it; th&ocirc; indeed &s;uch things may be found in a man who&s;e conduct is not agreable to heaven, and who is a &s;tran|ger to true felicity. The principles of action mu&s;t be taken into the account, in order to de|termine the character truly good, or not &s;o. Who, that is in&s;pired with a generous love to mankind, can think with plea&s;ure and appro|bation on a <HI>Pompey,</HI> a <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> or an <HI>Alexander,</HI> who were mighty men, &s;ubdued people and cities not a few, and marked their &s;teps in blood while they traver&s;ed the world! A man migh|ty in war, who is a &s;tranger to humanity and the gentle &s;pirit of the go&s;pel, may force trem|bling crowds to yield a feigned &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; to "bow down their necks that he may go over;" but will never be a public ble&s;&s;ing, nor enjoy &s;incere love and e&s;teem.</P>
<P>BUT each of the&s;e characters will be &s;et in a clearer light by comparing them together, as we propo&s;ed in the &s;econd place. This will di&s;cover him that is "&s;low to anger and rules his &s;pirit, to be better than the mighty and he that taketh a city."</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="008878_0012_10309C66890DF288">THE preference mu&s;t be given to the for|mer, as the difficulty of gaining the rule of our &s;pirits is greater than that of obtaining a mili|tary conque&s;t.</P>
<P>HOW hard is it to &s;uppre&s;s the rebellion of corrupt lu&s;ts and affections, and to bring them into obedience to the laws of Chri&s;t! How hard to hu&s;h angry and tumultuous pa&s;&s;ions, when we meet the provoking language, or the more provoking actions of our fellow-mortals; and according to the &s;pirit of the go&s;pel, "to &s;hew all meekne&s;s to all men, and overcome evil with good!" How difficult to maintain a &s;pirit calm and &s;erene, under lo&s;&s;es, and cro&s;&s;es, and grievous di&s;appointments! Do we not find, in this ca&s;e, "a law in our members waring a|gain&s;t the law of our minds;" and an evil &s;pi|rit counter-working the good? What hard &s;truggles! What &s;evere conflicts! What con|&s;tant watchings! What earne&s;t &s;upplications are nece&s;&s;ary, before we gain the rule of our own &s;pirits, &s;o as to pa&s;s unruffled thr&ocirc; the &s;hifting &s;cenes of life! We, in this &s;piritual warfare, "wre&s;tle not only with fle&s;h and blood, but with principalities and powers, and &s;piritual wickedne&s;&s;es in high places;" which abet the
<PB N="15" REF="008878_0013_10309C6962645240">
corrupt motions of the mind, in oppo&s;ition to the nobler principles of &s;ub&s;tantial goodne&s;s. To &s;ucceed therefore in this &s;piritual conflict, more vigorous exertions, as well as more pow|erful a&s;&s;i&s;tances from above, are nece&s;&s;ary, than to meet an enemy in the gate, to &s;cale the walls of a city, or to &s;ubject the numerous inhabi|tants thereof.</P>
<P>AGAIN,&mdash;Much greater is the happine&s;s re|&s;ulting from the former, than the latter con|que&s;t, even in this world.</P>
<P>THE former prepares a man to pa&s;s &s;mooth|ly thr&ocirc; the rougher pa&s;&s;ages of life, and gives tranquility of mind in the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing emer|gencies. View &s;uch an one in pro&s;perity, and a &s;oul healthful and pro&s;perous, doubles every comfort; and renders the good things of com|mon providence ble&s;&s;ings indeed. View him in adver&s;ity, "his mind is fixed, tru&s;ting in the Lord: He is like Mount Sion, which cannot be removed, but abideth forever." He has that "peace which pa&s;&s;es all under&s;tanding," and drinks deeply of the comforts of religion. The&s;e produce a noble firmne&s;s of mind, in the mid&s;t of the &s;torms and tempe&s;ts of this evil
<PB N="16" REF="008878_0014_10309C6C3A7FD868">
world. "Tho' the rain de&s;cends, and the floods come, and the winds blow, and beat upon him," he remains un&s;haken. Tho' in the partial judgment of &s;ome, his comforts may be &s;mall, yet it is to be remembred, that tho&s;e joys, like tho&s;e rivers, are often the deepe&s;t, and the mo&s;t la&s;ting, which run on in a &s;ilent &s;tream, without noi&s;e and tumult.</P>
<P>THE greate&s;t conqueror, who&s;e &s;pirit is not formed to &s;uch a religious firmne&s;s, by the energy of divine grace, and the long and ob&s;ti|nate practice of virtue, mu&s;t be a &s;tranger to &s;uch exalted happine&s;s. The &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the van|qui&s;hed,&mdash;the applau&s;e of the populace,&mdash;the glittering ornaments of military dre&s;s,&mdash;and the laurels of victory, may all accompany one, who&s;e mind is full of anxiety, confu&s;ion and guilt.</P>
<P>MOREOVER,&mdash;The man that has obtained a victory over his own &s;pirit, is fitted for more exten&s;ive u&s;efulne&s;s than he could be without it. This, far from di&s;qualifying him for any &s;tation and employment in life, &s;erves to make him more fit for every one.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="008878_0015_10309C6F1A2C0ED8">VIEW him in low life,&mdash;His mind is not &s;welled with boundle&s;s ambition, nor does a re&s;tle&s;s &s;pirit urge him on, at all adventures, and by any mea&s;ures, lawful or unlawful, to &s;eek a higher &s;phere of action: but his mind is hap|pily accommodated to his circum&s;tances; he is willing "to abide in the calling, wherein he is called of God;" and de&s;irous to fill with honor that &s;tation in which providence has placed him, how low &s;oever it be; &s;en&s;ible that in the civil, as well as in the natural body, &s;ome members are appointed to higher, and &s;ome to lower offices.</P>
<P>VIEW him as a magi&s;trate,&mdash;He, like the author of our religion, who&s;e &s;pirit dwells with|in him, will rule the people in meekne&s;s, and judge in equity. His gentlene&s;s will melt tho&s;e, whom rigour could not &s;ubdue. The autho|rity of the ruler, accompanied with the kind|ne&s;s of the chri&s;tian, will force a willing &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion from all; and in&s;en&s;ibly learn the re|bellious the language of obedience; "what wilt thou have me to do?" In con&s;equence of inward &s;erenity, "a law of kindne&s;s will dwell upon his lips;" which will often have a more powerful influence upon the &s;tubborn and re|fractory,
<PB N="18" REF="008878_0016_10309C71F7182FE0">
than the greate&s;t &s;everities of lan|guage; and give occa&s;ion to &s;ay; "how forcible are right words?" The magi&s;trate will be feared;&mdash;the man will be loved; &mdash; order will be maintained; and civil government made to an&s;wer the excellent ends for which it is de&s;igned. Such rulers will be likely "to rule for God, and be faithful; they will be a ter|ror to evil doers, and a prai&s;e to them that do well."</P>
<P>'TIS in vain to expect the&s;e happy effects from the admini&s;trations of tho&s;e, who are &s;laves to their pa&s;&s;ions, and attempt to rule the &s;pirits of others, without ruling their own. The reins of government will be held with an un|&s;teady hand; relaxed too much, or too much &s;traitned. The petulance of the man, will counteract the influence of the magi&s;trate; by which means authority will &s;ink, and law be trodden under foot. His ob&s;ervation mu&s;t have been very much confined, and his know|ledge of human nature very &s;mall, who is not convinced that this repre&s;entation is ju&s;t.</P>
<P>VIEW the man al&s;o that rules his &s;pirit by the laws of Chri&s;t, acting in a military charac|ter,
<PB N="19" REF="008878_0017_10309C739F497DB0">
&mdash;How great an addition will this be to his honor and u&s;efulne&s;s! Hereby the officer will learn to command with meekne&s;s of wi&s;dom; and the private to obey, "not by con&s;traint, but willingly." Hereby an inviolable union of hearts will be promoted. The commander will not be ba&s;ely de&s;erted in time of danger; nor the troops wantonly &s;old to de&s;truction; but each will be careful to keep his &s;tation, and every one re&s;olved to do his duty. What won|ders may we not expect to &s;ee performed by &s;uch forces as the&s;e!</P>
<P>THEY greatly mi&s;take, who imagine men nece&s;&s;arily enervated and rendered effeminate, by having their &s;pirits ruled by the gentle laws of religion, &s;o as to be le&s;s di&s;po&s;ed to engage in the military &s;ervice, when properly invited thereto by providence; or le&s;s likely to act up to the character of valiant &s;oldiers.&mdash;Far from this:&mdash; None have &s;o tender a concern for their country; none will be more ready to exert them&s;elves for the public good; none can face dangers with &s;o much fortitude of mind; none can view &s;laugh|ter and death &s;pread before them, in all its gloomy horrors, with &s;o rational a courage, with &s;uch an elevation of &s;oul, as they who&s;e
<PB N="20" REF="008878_0018_10309C7902444E98">
&s;pirits are greatly chri&s;tian; and who&s;e hopes of happine&s;s beyond the grave, are rendered &s;trong and bright, by a long and intimate ac|quaintance with the power of religion. The confidence of &s;uch is rea&s;on, not madne&s;s. They act from principles which can't be annihilated thr&ocirc; the &s;udden a&s;&s;aults of fear, or ba&s;e tempta|tions to de&s;ertion: &s;uch as a regard to the ho|nor of God, the intere&s;t of religion, and the pre&s;ervation of our civil rights. Such are "mighty thr&ocirc; God for the pulling down the &s;trong holds of their enemies: they go forth in the name and &s;trength of the Lord of ho&s;ts, and thr&ocirc; him do valiantly." Though they are dive&s;ted of the re&s;tle&s;s pa&s;&s;ions and fury of un|&s;anctified minds, yet none have their &s;pirits more fired with zeal and vigor than they, when the &s;ervice of God and their country invite them to action.</P>
<P>BUT then their magnanimity and zeal exert them&s;elves, not to gratify revenge, not to mul|tiply the &s;lain, or to triumph in the mi&s;eries of men; but to e&s;tabli&s;h the cau&s;e of truth and ju&s;tice between contending powers. They don't put off humanity in the field; nor borrow the &s;pirit of him, who, "like a roring lion,
<PB N="21" REF="008878_0019_10309C7AA76A0EB0">
goes about &s;eeking whom he may devour." The occa&s;ion for war gives them pain; they fight for peace. And it is evident that wars will be le&s;s frequent, or cea&s;e, in proportion to the prevalence of a &s;pirit of &s;elf-government, which is the &s;pirit of the go&s;pel. When every one, from the monarch to the pea&s;ant, &s;hall <HI>be &s;low to anger, and rule his &s;pirit,</HI> "wars &s;hall cea&s;e to the ends of the earth: Nation &s;hall not lift up &s;word again&s;t nation, neither &s;hall they learn war any more." This is evident from the demand of the apo&s;tle;&mdash; "whence come wars and fightings among you? Come they not hence, even of your lu&s;ts, which war in your members?" But we may not expect the pre|valence of this &s;pirit will be &s;o great, as to clo&s;e the tragical &s;cenes of war, under the pre&s;ent di&s;pen&s;ation. Chri&s;t "came not to &s;end peace on earth, but a &s;word." But, "when he &s;hall come a &s;econd time, he will remove from them that are his, every thing that offends," and e&s;ta|bli&s;h them in uninterrupted peace and happi|ne&s;s for ever.</P>
<P>FURTHERMORE,&mdash;They who bring their &s;pirits under the government of rea&s;on and re|ligion, gain thereby a greater intere&s;t in the love
<PB N="22" REF="008878_0020_10309C7C8DB9FE08">

<P>THE mighty man, who&s;e mind is cruel and &s;avage, who "continually breaths out threat|nings and &s;laughter," th&ocirc; he &s;hould be &s;ucce&s;s|ful in war, th&ocirc; he &s;hould depopulate cities and countries, and go on from conquering to con|quer, is &s;till an object upon which every man of humanity and religion thinks with horror: He is feared by many, loved by none. Not &s;o the man, who&s;e every tho't, and every pa&s;&s;ion, is captivated to the obedience of Chri&s;t: a diffu|&s;ive benevolence to all mankind po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es his heart; and he learns to obey that difficult command of our Saviour, "Love your ene|mies." Such a &s;pirit gives him a place in the warme&s;t affections of all.</P>
<P>WAS it not this &s;pirit appearing in our late gracious Sovereign, which gave him &s;o firm a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the hearts of all his &s;ubjects, while he lived, and which renders his memory &s;o pre|cious to them, &s;ince his removal? The nations have ri&s;en up with one voice to call him ble&s;|&s;ed; and open and &s;olemn re&s;pects have been de|&s;ervedly

paid to his memory. Yet upon this return|ing public occa&s;ion, you will allow me to &s;ay;&mdash; that among his many royal accompli&s;hments, the humanity and gentlene&s;s of &s;pirit which he appeared po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, were none of the lea&s;t; the natural con&s;equence of which was a mild and &s;teady admini&s;tration. Th&ocirc; he manife&s;ted a &s;urpri&s;ing firmne&s;s of mind, in his clo&s;e at|tention to, and vigorous &s;upport of the pre&s;ent war; and that at a time when his flow of &s;pi|rits might be &s;uppo&s;ed greatly abated, by the infirmities of age; yet &s;o &s;u&s;ceptible was his heart of the &s;ofter pa&s;&s;ions, that he always prefered peace to war, when it could be obtain|ed upon terms honorable to his crown. A &s;triking proof of this he gave in the overtures of peace which he made to his old perfidious enemies the <HI>French;</HI> at a time when &s;ucce&s;s attended all his military enterprizes; at a time when his enemies were extremely reduced; and at a time, when an ungenerous monarch would have thought it a fair opportunity to gratify a revengeful temper, by &s;cornfully rejecting the mo&s;t equitable propo&s;als for an accommodation. The happy effects of this gentle &s;pirit have &s;pread far and wide. They have been &s;en&s;ibly felt, and gratefully acknowledged, by his mo&s;t

dutiful &s;ubjects in the&s;e American colonies.&mdash; While we &s;peak of this, to do honor to his me|mory, we nece&s;&s;arily renew our grief for the very great lo&s;s we have &s;u&s;tained by his death.&mdash; But perhaps it may be tho't un&s;ea&s;onable to in|dulge to &s;orrow in any great degree, &s;ince thro' the goodne&s;s of God, this lo&s;s is &s;o happily re|paired, and our joy takes place of our mourn|ing, by the acce&s;&s;ion of our pre&s;ent gracious &s;overeign, King GEORGE the THIRD, to the Briti&s;h throne; who &s;hares &s;o largely in the excellent &s;pirit of his royal predece&s;&s;or; and who is formed, we hope, by &s;o great an exam|ple, and by the grace of God, to &s;uch a temper, as will render him a di&s;tingui&s;hed ble&s;&s;ing to the kingdoms, at the head of which he is placed.</P>
<P>NOR does this mildne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition &s;erve only to rai&s;e crowned heads high in the e&s;teem of their &s;ubjects; tho&s;e that act in a lower &s;phere, enjoy the affections of their fellow-men, in proportion to the degree in which they po&s;|&s;e&s;s it.

the tyrant, feels the influence of humanity and religion on his mind: his actions breath the &s;pirit of the go&s;pel, and he is "mighty to &s;ave," as well as mighty to de&s;troy. His cap|tives, &s;truck with the unexpected clemency and tenderne&s;s of their conqueror, forget the &s;or|rows of a captivated &s;tate, and fool in their brea&s;ts the delightful &s;en&s;ations of love and gratitude to their gentle ma&s;ter. Who does not love, who does not admire, tho&s;e that manife&s;t &s;uch a &s;pirit!

The mo&s;t that will be &s;aid of the one, in a little time, will probably be, that &s;omebody cruelly con|quered &s;omebody; while the actions of the other, will be carefully trea&s;ured up in the minds of many, and mentioned to his honor from gene|ration to generation.</P>
<P>BESIDES,&mdash;If we view them when they draw near to the clo&s;e of this mortal &s;tate, and approach the &s;olemn period of death, how dif|ferent &s;hall we u&s;ually find the temper of their minds then! How differently will a review
<PB N="26" REF="008878_0024_10309C885606E698">
of their re&s;pective characters affect them then! Then tho&s;e tragical &s;cenes, which, for a while, might excite the admiration and applau&s;e of half-thinking mortals, will produce no joyful reflections, to &s;ooth the a king hearts of the&s;e men of blood. Their minds, if de&s;titute of any other &s;upport, be&s;ides what ari&s;es from a review of their unchri&s;tian heroi&s;m, mu&s;t be either &s;trangely &s;tupid, or el&s;e filled with the mo&s;t gloomy images&mdash;Images of that blackne&s;s of darkne&s;s to which they are going. But "at even time it &s;hall u&s;ually be light" with tho&s;e that have &s;hone in the other character. Their having the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t, is a good evidence that they are his;&mdash;his true di&s;ciples and fol|lowers; intere&s;ted in all the promi&s;es of his go&s;pel; intitled to all the important ble&s;&s;ings of his purcha&s;e. Such will have hope in their death, and immortal light and glory dawning upon them, when they clo&s;e their eyes upon this world. There is no truer &s;tandard by which to judge of actions and characters, than the a&s;pect they have upon the eternal &s;tate, and their ten|dency to make us happy or mi&s;erable there. And if we make this a deci&s;ive rule in the pre|&s;ent ca&s;e, how much more noble and advanta|geous, will a victory over our own &s;pirits ap|pear,

than any martial atchievements, while we are &s;trangers to &s;elf-government! The one, will leave us in the power of our wor&s;t enemies; in a &s;tate of e&s;trangement from God; without any intere&s;t in his favor; and doomed to the &s;trange puni&s;hment appointed for the workers of iniquity:&mdash;while the other, re&s;cues us from the power of corrupt lu&s;ts and affections; vin|dicates us into the glorious liberty of the &s;ons of God; accompli&s;hes the de&s;ign of Chri&s;t's death upon us; and prepares us to receive an unfading crown of life.

<P>THUS I have endeavoured a compari&s;on of the characters in our text, with regard to the influence they have upon our honor, u&s;efulne&s;s and comfort here, and our happine&s;s in the fu|ture &s;tate. The de&s;ign of this comparative view is not to &s;et them in oppo&s;ition, or to repre&s;ent them incon&s;i&s;tent with each other; but to di&s;co|ver their re&s;pective worth. And is not the re|&s;ult of this compari&s;on plainly this, that the for|mer is truly excellent and u&s;eful, in it&s;elf con&s;i|dered; while the other is &s;o, only when it is found in connection with the former?</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="008878_0026_10309C8F4B6B9D50">LET us all be animated, by what has been offered, to pur&s;ue them with a zeal proporti|onate to their importance. Let us view them in a proper light, and po&s;&s;e&s;s our minds with a lively &s;en&s;e of their re&s;pective u&s;efulne&s;s; and &s;hall we not find, that, while the things which &s;erve to promote the one, ought to be done; tho&s;e that promote the other, ought not to be left undone?</P>
<P>I HOPE none will think I mi&s;take the oc|ca&s;ion of our being together at this time; or bring a di&s;cour&s;e rather to di&s;countenance, than encourage, a military &s;pirit; rather to &s;ink, than rai&s;e, the character of a &s;oldier. Sure nothing is more di&s;tant from my intention; nor can I think this has been done, unle&s;s it has by atten|ding to the true &s;pirit and meaning of that pa&s;|&s;age of &s;cripture, which is the foundation of the pre&s;ent di&s;cour&s;e. The rea&s;onable and religious government of our &s;pirits, which I have been de&s;cribing, how much more important an attainment &s;oever it may be, than that with which it has been compared, is yet, far from be|ing contrary to a military &s;pirit; or from hav|ing any tendency to weaken or de&s;troy it: &s;o far, that I believe it will be found the only true

<P>WHEN men become <HI>&s;low to anger,</HI> and learn to <HI>rule their &s;pirits,</HI> they certainly concur with the dictates of rea&s;on, and the word of God; and therefore cannot, on that account, be &s;aid to oppo&s;e a military &s;pirit; unle&s;s rea|&s;on and revelation tend to do it. That the former has not &s;uch a tendency, I need not &s;pend time to prove; and that the latter has not, is ea&s;ily collected from many pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, not only in the old te&s;tament, where God &s;tiles him&s;elf "a man of war," and "the Lord of ho&s;ts;" and where we find, that troops were led out to battle by God's expre&s;s command; that he "taught their hands to war, and their fingers to fight," and made them victorious by his mighty arm; but al&s;o in the new te&s;tament, where, of the prince of peace him&s;elf it is &s;aid, that "in righteou&s;ne&s;s he doth judge and make war"; and where we find the me&s;&s;enger &s;ent before Chri&s;t's face, to prepare his way, implicitly owning the lawfulne&s;s of a military life, in the an&s;wer which he gave to the &s;oldiers demand;

<P>'TIS a departure from &s;uch nece&s;&s;ary regu|lations of temper and conduct, which renders the &s;oldier unchri&s;tian and ba&s;e; when the only military accompli&s;hments he can boa&s;t, are a mind fierce and inhuman, that "fears not God nor regards man", an "arm of fle&s;h", and "feet that are &s;wift to &s;hed blood".</P>

Under the influence and en|couragement of HIS EXCELLENCY, the captain general, we hope you will not only &s;upport a martial &s;pirit in general, but endea|vour to cultivate <HI>the regular art of war;</HI> the nece&s;&s;ity and importance whereof, in New Eng|land, beyond what was requi&s;ite in our infant &s;tate, when we had no enemy to meet in the field, when our warfare was only with undi&s;ci|plined &s;avages in the wilderne&s;s, we tru&s;t does not e&s;cape your notice and attention. The pre&s;ent war has afforded undeniable proofs, that in or|der to &s;ucceed in battle the military art mu&s;t <HI>be &s;tudied.</HI> Your knowledge and experience herein, Gentlemen, we hope will be carried to &s;uch a pitch, as will not only render you pecu|liarly u&s;eful your&s;elves, if called to action; but al&s;o have a good influence to excite in others, a laudable ambition to excell in the &s;ame things.

followed, it will be nece&s;&s;ary for you to &s;hine, not only in the common ornaments of a &s;ol|dier, but al&s;o in what is very con&s;i&s;tent herewith, "the ornament of a meek and quiet &s;pirit." To be u&s;efully acquainted with the art of war, you mu&s;t not be &s;trangers to the religion of the prince of peace. Would you conquer others, you mu&s;t not be conquered by your|&s;elves,&mdash; by your own lu&s;ts and affections. Slavery breaks the &s;pirits, and &s;ubdues the force of the mind: and certainly no &s;lavery can be more effectual to do it, than to be ma&s;tered by your own pa&s;&s;ions. Would you therefore en|joy the comfort, honor and advantage of your character, as &s;oldiers, inli&s;t your&s;elves under the banner of Chri&s;t; be firmly per&s;uaded of the excellency and u&s;efulne&s;s of his &s;pirit; and let your endeavors to po&s;&s;e&s;s your&s;elves of it, be animated in proportion thereto.</P>
<P>TO CONCLUDE,&mdash;Let us all be in&s;truct|ed by the doctrine of our text. Let us all en|deavour to have our minds deeply impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of the importance of ruling our &s;pirits.

<P>THE con&s;ideration of the infinite advanta|ges of this conque&s;t over our &s;pirits, may well in&s;pire us with re&s;olution to encounter all the difficulties that lie in the way hereof. And that there are difficulties, great and numerous, is a truth, which, far from denying or conceal|ing, I mu&s;t repeatedly in&s;i&s;t upon, and &s;trongly urge the belief of: &s;uch difficulties as many &s;hall faintly &s;eek to overcome, and &s;hall not be able: &s;uch as will require all our &s;trength and fortitude to re&s;i&s;t; and all, will be found too little, without power from on high. He only "that formed the &s;pirit of man within him," can form it to a new and divine temper. To him therefore, let our thoughts be directed: to him let us all repair: His grace let us earne&s;tly implore: and for our encouragement herein,

<P>LET us "war a good warfare," and "fight the good fight of faith;" humbly "looking to Je&s;us, the captain of our &s;alvation," without whom we can do nothing; but thro' the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of who&s;e &s;pirit "we can do all things;" and &s;hall come off more than conquerors in this &s;piritual conflict.

<P>LET us endeavour to lay our &s;ouls open to the full power of the&s;e important con&s;iderations, and act under the influence of them, 'til "the &s;ame mind is produced in us which was al&s;o in Chri&s;t Je&s;us;" and we are prepared to enter his peaceful kingdom, where univer&s;al love and harmony reign for ever and ever.</P>
