<L>HAIL happy Saint on thy immortal throne!</L>
<L>To thee complaints of grievance are unknown;</L>
<L>We hear no more the mu&s;ic of thy tongue,</L>
<L>Thy wonted auditories cea&s;e to throng.</L>
<L>Thy le&s;&s;ons in unequal'd accents flow'd!</L>
<L>While emulation in each bo&s;om glow'd;</L>
<L>Thou did&s;t, in &s;trains of eloquence refin'd,</L>
<L>Inflame the &s;oul, and captivate the mind.</L>
<L>Unhappy we, the &s;etting Sun deplore!</L>
<L>Which once was &s;plendid, but it &s;hines no more&punc;</L>
<L>He leaves this earth for Heaven's unmea&s;ur'd height:</L>
<L>And worlds unknown, receive him from our &s;ight;</L>
<L>There WHITEFIELD wings, with rapid cour&s;e his way,</L>
<L>And &s;ails to Zion, through va&s;t &s;eas of day.</L>

<L>When his AMERICANS were burden'd &s;ore,</L>
<L>When &s;treets were crim&s;on'd with their guiltle&s;s gore!</L>
<L>Unrival'd friend&s;hip in his brea&s;t now &s;trove:</L>
<L>The fruit thereof was charity and love</L>
<L>Towards <HI>America</HI>&mdash;could&s;t thou do more</L>
<L>Than leave thy native home, the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> &s;hore,</L>
<L>To cro&s;s the great Atlantic's wat'ry road,</L>
<L>To &s;ee <HI>America'</HI>s di&s;tre&s;s'd abode?</L>
<L>Thy prayers, great Saint, and thy ince&s;&s;ant cries,</L>
<L>Have pierc'd the bo&s;om of thy native &s;kies!</L>
<L>Thou moon ha&s;t &s;een, and ye bright &s;tars of light</L>
<L>Have witne&s;s been of his reque&s;ts by night!</L>
<L>He pray'd that grace in every heart might dwell:</L>
<L>He long'd to &s;ee <HI>America</HI> excell;</L>
<L>He charg'd its youth to let the grace divine</L>
<L>Ari&s;e, and in their future actions &s;hine;</L>
<L>He offer'd THAT he did him&s;elf receive,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A greater gift not GOD him&s;elf can give:</L>
<L>He urg'd the need of HIM to every one;</L>
<L>It was no le&s;s than GOD's co-equal SON!</L>
<L>Take HIM ye wretched for your only good;</L>
<L>Take HIM ye &s;tarving &s;ouls to be your food.</L>
<L>Ye thir&s;ty, come to this life giving &s;tream:</L>
<L>Ye Preachers, take him for your joyful theme:</L>
<L>Take HIM, "my dear AMERICANS," he &s;aid,</L>
<L>Be your complaints in his kind bo&s;om laid:</L>
<L>Take HIM ye <HI>Africans,</HI> he longs for you;</L>
<L>Impartial SAVIOUR, is his title due;</L>
<L>If you will chu&s;e to walk in grace's road,</L>
<L>You &s;hall be &s;ons, and kings, and prie&s;ts to GOD.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Great COUNTESS! we <HI>Americans</HI> revere</L>
<L>Thy name, and thus condole thy grief &s;incere:</L>
<L>We mourn with thee, that TOM<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> ob&s;curely plac'd,</L>
<L>In which thy Chaplain undi&s;turb'd doth re&s;t.</L>
<L><HI>New-England</HI> &s;ure, doth feel the ORPHAN's &s;mart;</L>
<L>Reveals the true &s;en&s;ations of his heart:</L>
<L>Since this fair Sun, withdraws his golden rays,</L>
<L>No more to brighten the&s;e di&s;tre&s;sful days!</L>
<L>His lonely <HI>Tabernacle,</HI> &s;ees no more</L>
<L>A WHITEFIELD landing on the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> &s;hore:</L>
<L>Then let us view him in yon azure &s;kies:</L>
<L>Let every mind with this lov'd object ri&s;e.</L>
<L>No more can he exert his lab'ring breath,</L>
<L>Seiz'd by the cruel me&s;&s;enger of death.</L>
<L>What can his dear AMERICA return?</L>
<L>But drop a tear upon his happy urn,</L>
<L>Thou tomb, &s;halt &s;afe retain thy &s;acred tru&s;t,</L>
<L>Till life divine re-animate his du&s;t.</L>
