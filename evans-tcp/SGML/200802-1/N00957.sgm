<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>Exodus XX. 12.</BIBL>
<Q>Honour thy Father and thy Mother: that thy dayes may be long upon the Land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Moral Law was revealed unto men from the be|ginning of the World: it is probable that God im|planted the habitual knowledge thereof on the minds of <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve:</HI> if &s;o, this work was much of &s;uch a nature, as when God taught the Apo&s;tles at once di|vers Languages, that they had never Learned. This work differs from two other ways of writing the Law on mens hearts: One is &s;poken of <HI>Rom.</HI> 12. 15. <HI>Which &s;hew the work of the Law written in their hearts.</HI> This is nothing el&s;e but the giving of men natural Under&s;tandings and Con&s;ciences, able to di&s;cern the difference between right and wrong. The other is &s;poken of, <HI>Jer.</HI> 31. 33. <HI>I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts.</HI> The thing intended is that God would give them a di&s;po&s;ition to keep his Laws.</P>
<P>In &s;ucceeding Ages God handed down the knowledge of his Laws partly by immediate revelation, partly by the in&s;truction of the <HI>Pa|triarchs,</HI> until the time that the Children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> were come into the Wilderne&s;s of <HI>Sinai:</HI> at that time God publi&s;hed the Ten Com|mandments both by word of Mouth, and al&s;o in writing on two Tables of Stone. This Publication of the Law was attended with many awful manife&s;tations of the Maje&s;ty of God. <HI>There were thun|ders and lightnings, and a thick Cloud, and the &s;ound of a Trumpet, exceeding loud, Mount Sinai was altogether on a &s;moak, becau&s;e the Lord
<PB N="2" REF="001148_0003_0FB08F8DE22A7D90">
de&s;cended upon it in fire; and the &s;moak a&s;cended like the &s;moak of a furnace,</HI> Exod. 19. 16, 18.</P>
<P>One <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">a&s;on of this terrible appearance at the giving of the Law, was to prepare the Children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> for the Ob&s;ervation of it. They were a rude and untractable People, and needed &s;uch di&s;cove|ries of the greatne&s;s of God, as might make an abiding impre&s;&s;ion on their hearts, and di&s;po&s;e them to keep his Commands: But there &s;eems to be another rea&s;on of it; which is, that though the Children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> were not under a Covenant of works, yet they were under a Legal di&s;pen&s;ation of the Covenant of Grace: this di&s;pen&s;ation that they were under did &s;hadow forth a Covenant of works: and there|fore <HI>Paul</HI> makes u&s;e of the threatnings and promi&s;es of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> to &s;et forth a Covenant of works, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3. 10, 12. And therefore he gives a repre&s;entation here of the dreadful danger of tho&s;e that are under the Covenant of works.</P>
<P>This Law is divided into two Tables, the fir&s;t re&s;pects duties of wor&s;hip unto God, the &s;econd duties of love to Man. The&s;e words contain the fir&s;t Commandment of the Second Table: where you may Con&s;ider, (1.) The Precept. (2.) The Promi&s;e.</P>
<P>Que&s;t. 1. <HI>Who are meant by Father and Mother?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Nextly natural Parents: But the words are not to be limited to them, they are particularly in&s;tanced in: but all Superiours are comprehended; for other Superiours are called Fathers in the Scrip|ture: 2 <HI>King.</HI> 5. 13. 2 <HI>King.</HI> 2. 12. And there is an honour due to them, which is required in this Commandment.</P>
<P>Que&s;t. 2. <HI>What is the Honour here required?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> That honour that their relation calls for. Reverence, Obedi|ence, Recompence, according to the nature of the Relation. Men mu&s;t carry towards Parents, Ma&s;ters, Teachers, Magi&s;trates, &s;uita|bly to the honourablene&s;s of that Station, which God has &s;et them in.</P>
<P>Que&s;t. 3. <HI>What is further implyed by this Precept?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> That Parents and all Superiours do carry &s;o as to de&s;erve Ho|nour. That Superiours do their duty to their Inferiours: as God don't allow a liberty to Children to carry as they will to their Pa|rents, &s;o he does not allow Parents to carry as they will to their
<PB N="3" REF="001148_0004_0FB08F8EE5FBD4C8">
Children. As he takes care of the Parent, &s;o of the Children.</P>
<P>Que&s;t. 4. <HI>What is intended by the Promi&s;e?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> 1. That Obedient Children &s;hall have their lives lengthned out. This is indefinitely promi&s;ed. The Apo&s;tle does &s;o explain it, <HI>Eph.</HI> 6. 2, 3. Be&s;ides it is implyed that they &s;hall have &s;uch out|ward ble&s;&s;ings as &s;hall make their lives comfortable.</P>
<P N="2">2. That while the Rulers and People of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> keep this Com|mand, God would pre&s;erve them in their own Land and ble&s;s them there: it was the manner of the <HI>Babylonian</HI> Kings when they con|quered a People, to tran&s;plant them, and carry them into &s;ome other Countries. So the Ten Tribes, and afterwards <HI>Judah</HI> were carried into Captivity. But God promi&s;es, that while they keep this Com|mand, it &s;hall not be &s;o, but he will ble&s;s them in their own Land. This is evident becau&s;e the Law was not only given to them as a rule of Life to particular Per&s;ons, but as the Condition of a publick Co|venant with the Church and Common-wealth of <HI>I&s;rael, Deut.</HI> 5. 2. <HI>The Lord our God made a Covenant with us in Horeb.</HI> And God pro|mi&s;es to be&s;tow publick ble&s;&s;ings on them, in ca&s;e this Command be kept.</P>
<P>DOCT. <HI>The way for a People to be Pre&s;erved and Ble&s;&s;ed of God, is for the Publick Rulers and the Ruled, to do their Duty to one another.</HI> It is a matter of great concernment for a People to be ble&s;&s;ed of God: and in this way God has promi&s;ed to be&s;tow it upon them. Many of the Rulers of the World do neglect to do their duty to their Peo|ple; they are Tyrants, they are Oppre&s;&s;ors, they are Per&s;ecutors: &amp; many People carry contrary to their Duty to their Rulers, they are guilty of Seditions, In&s;urrections and Murmurings, and are other|wi&s;e faulty, &s;uch carriages open a door to Ruine. But if the fifth Commandment be kept the People will be kept. It is a difficult thing for Rulers, to carry as they ought to the People, and there is difficulty in the Peoples carrying as they ought to their Rulers, but there is great incouragement to do it, &s;o long as they do it God will pre&s;erve them. While Rulers and Ruled do their duty one towards another, it is a &s;ign of a con&s;iderable degree of Religion, and a procu|ring cau&s;e of Pro&s;perity. Their Ob&s;ervation of this Command will
<PB N="4" REF="001148_0005_0FB08F90619C89B8">
be their pre&s;ervation: it is not a matter of indifferency how Rulers carry to the People, and how People carry to the Rulers, Gods ble&s;|&s;ing or cur&s;ing of the Land does depend upon that. The abu&s;es that are offered unto a People by their Rulers, and the abu&s;es that are offered unto the Rulers by the People are deeply re&s;ented by God. But while Rulers and Ruled do attend their relative duties, God will continue his relation to them, and be their defence; while they keep this Command, they will keep their Land, their Lives will be long on the Land which the Lord their God giveth them.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider 1. <HI>God hath appointed divers Orders of men, both in the Common-wealth, and in the Church.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. He has appointed that in the Common-wealth, &s;ome &s;hould be Rulers, and others Ruled. It is agreeable to the light of nature that it be &s;o: if there were an equality all things would run into confu&s;i|on: if there were none to Govern, there would be many to Tyrannize. If there were no Order among them, there would quickly be intolle|rable di&s;order: Government is that which unites and &s;trengthens, and makes them move regularly: but the principal foundation of Civil Power is divine Ordination, <HI>Rom.</HI> 13. 1. <HI>The powers that be, are ordained of God.</HI> The being of Rulers is not only by divine permi&s;|&s;ion, but by divine precept: <HI>Deut.</HI> 16. 18. <HI>Judges and Officers thou &s;halt make thee in all thy gates.</HI> Though the per&s;ons be appointed by man, yet their Authority is e&s;tabli&s;hed by God. The particu|lar forms of Government are humane Ordinances; God does not confine all Nations to one particular form, there may be diver&s;ity in forms of Government, without any affront to God: the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e be &s;everal forms, that have their conveniences and inconveniences, and if one be be&s;t, yet others are allowed; that matter is lef<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> to the appoint|ment of men, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, 14. <HI>Submit your &s;elves <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> every ordinance of man for the Lords &s;ake, whether it be to the King <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Supream, or unto Go|vernours, as tho&s;e that are &s;ent by him.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. God hath appointed that in the Church, &s;ome &s;hould be Rulers and others Ruled. A Church is an orde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> Society, like an Army, con&s;i&s;ting of Rulers and Ruled: as God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ppointed Prie&s;ts in the <HI>Jew|i&s;h</HI> Church: &s;o he has appointed Offers in the Go&s;pel Church.
<PB N="5" REF="001148_0006_0FB093A7F4A92F98">
A Church is not a confu&s;ed body of people, but they are brought into order, and each one mu&s;t ob&s;erve his proper Station: It is compared to a natural body, wherein there are divers organs ap|pointed to their peculiar Services. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12. 14. and <HI>&s;eq. Eph.</HI> 4. 11. God has not only appointed a Government in the Church as in the Common-wealth, but he has appointed moreover what Officers &s;hall be in the Church: the per&s;ons that &s;hall be Officers he leaves to the choice of men, according to general rules: But the Offices them&s;elves are appointed by God; and men may neither aug|ment nor dimini&s;h their power. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> mu&s;t do all things accord|ing to the pattern &s;hewed him in the Mount.</P>
<P>Que&s;t. <HI>What is the work of Rulers to the People?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> 1. To do the work of their particular Office faithfully. The Government of a People is not entirely in one hand; but it is di&s;tri|buted among many: Many per&s;ons have an hand in the Govern|ment. Some are fixed in an higher Orb, and &s;ome in a lower; &s;ome of them are Coun&s;ellors, &s;ome Judges, &s;ome Repre&s;entatives, &s;ome Ju&s;tices; and it is every ones duty to do the work of his own Of|fice. 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 19. 6. <HI>He &s;aid to the Judges, take heed what you do, for ye Judge not for man, but for the Lord:</HI> &amp; ver. 11. <HI>Amariah is over you in matters of the Lord, and Zebadiah the Ruler of the Hou&s;e of Judah for all the Kings matters.</HI> It is not the duty of one Ruler to fulfil the Office of another, but every one is bound to attend the work of his own Office. They do not di&s;charge their duty by complaining one of another, but by fulfilling their own work. <HI>Col.</HI> 4. 17. <HI>Say to Archippus, take heed to the Mini&s;try that thou ha&s;t received of the Lord, that thou fulfil it.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. To be good examples to the people. Rulers are Leaders, and their actions are pre&s;idential. They may not pull down with one hand, what they build up with the other: The practices of Rulers have a great influence as well as their Laws; Rulers teach others as well by their Conver&s;ation, as by their Laws and Sentences. Good Carriages in men of Publick Place, do &s;tir up others to imi|tation; their good carriages make others fear to carry badly, and &s;ometimes to love to carry well; but if the head be ill, the whole
<PB N="6" REF="001148_0007_0FB093AAA0357BC0">
body will be out of order. The ill behaviour of Rulers is greatly Infectious; bad examples in &s;uch imbolden others to carry badly: bad examples in &s;uch draw and invite others to carry badly; bad examples in &s;uch, are made an apology for others that carry bad|ly: Bad Carriages in &s;uch, make them to lo&s;e much of their Au|thority.</P>
<P>Que&s;t. <HI>What is the Duty of People to their Rulers?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> 1. To &s;ubmit to their Government. The people mu&s;t not Over-rule their Rulers. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2. 13. <HI>Submit your &s;elves to every Or|dinance of man for the Lords &s;ake.</HI> Heb. 13. 17. <HI>Obey them that have the Rule over you, and &s;ubmit your &s;elves:</HI> People mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the Laws and Orders of Rulers, they mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the Sentences of Rulers, they mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the Taxations of Rulers: all Di&s;obe|dience and Seditious Practices are contrary to the duty of the people: <HI>Sheba</HI> was a Rebel, when he &s;aid, <HI>To your Tents O I&s;rael. Dathan</HI> and <HI>Abiram</HI> were Rebels, when they &s;aid, <HI>We will not come up.</HI> Numb. 16. 12. When <HI>Corah</HI> and his Company gathered them|&s;elves again&s;t <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Aaron,</HI> they took too much upon them, <HI>Ye take too much upon you, ye Sons of Levi, Numb.</HI> 16. 7.</P>
<P N="2">2. To A&s;&s;i&s;t and Encourage them. They mu&s;t &s;trengthen their hearts, and &s;trengthen their hands; they mu&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;t them with their prayers, that they may obtain help from God for them: they mu&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;t by information; wickedne&s;s may quickly over-run a Land, if the people are not careful to inform Rulers; they mu&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;t them with their Pur&s;es, they mu&s;t &s;upport the Government, and when there is need they mu&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;t them by force; a &s;pirit to de&s;ert Rulers, and a &s;pirit to murmur again&s;t them, are very repugnant to the duty of the people. <HI>Take here two Cautions.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. There be other &s;ins that bring Calamity be&s;ide the mi&s;car|riages of Rulers and Ruled about their mutual duties: the Con|dition of the Covenant is univer&s;al Obedience unto the Commands of God. So that if Rulers and Ruled do attend their relative duties, yet upon the account of other tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, God may bring Judgments. Let Rulers and Ruled carry never &s;o well to one another, that is no &s;ecurity to the Land that they &s;hall have no
<PB N="7" REF="001148_0008_0FB093ABE6D2D7C0">
Calamity: all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;ible Di&s;obedience does expo&s;e unto the Judgment of God: a People have no liberty to break any of the Command|ments of God without puni&s;hment. Gods Covenant gives no tole|ration of &s;in, <HI>Deut.</HI> 6. 25. <HI>It &s;hall be our righteou&s;ne&s;s, if we ob&s;erve to do all the&s;e Commandments.</HI> If a People manife&s;t a &s;pirit of Pride, or Worldline&s;s, or Unbelief, they lay them&s;elves open to Judgment.</P>
<P N="2">2. Le&s;&s;er failings of Rulers and Ruled about relative duties will not bring ruine upon a People. Gods way is to proportion his di&s;|pen&s;ations to the carriages of his People: though the pro&s;perity of a People does much depend upon the keeping of the fifth Command|ment, yet there may be &s;ome le&s;&s;er failures in this matter and yet a People continue to be a pro&s;perous People, <HI>P&s;a.</HI> 130. 3. <HI>If thou Lord &s;hould&s;t mark iniquity, O Lord who could &s;tand?</HI> There may be &s;ome Obedience to the fifth Commandment, yet a People be very mi&s;e|rable: there may be &s;ome di&s;obedience to it, and yet a People be very happy. There were failings in the days of <HI>A&s;a, Jeho&s;haphat</HI> &amp; <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> yet <HI>Judah</HI> enjoyed much of Gods pre&s;ence: le&s;&s;er defects will not make a breach between God and his People.</P>
<P><HI>The Rea&s;ons of the Doctrine.</HI></P>
<P>While Rulers and Ruled do their duty to one another the Cove|nant will be kept as to the &s;ub&s;tance of it: if they keep the fifth Commandment, they will keep every one of the Commandments: the fifth Command is an hedge about the re&s;t. Let Rulers and Ruled doe their duty one to another, and that will keep them from all &s;orts of heinous tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions again&s;t the fir&s;t or &s;econd Table of the Law: if Rulers be remi&s;s in their work, that Opens a door to a world of Wickedne&s;s, iniquity will break in like a flood upon a People: as when there was no King in <HI>I&s;rael, every one did what was right in his own eyes:</HI> or if the People be head-&s;trong and will not &s;ubmit to Government; they will quickly ca&s;t off the Govern|ment of God and take a Licentious liberty: but &s;o long as Govern|ment is duly managed by Rulers and &s;ubmitted to by the People, the &s;ub&s;tance of the Covenant will be kept.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Much Sin will be prevented.</HI> The making of good Laws and Orders, and faithful admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice, prevents abundance of
<PB N="8" REF="001148_0009_0FB093AD77455678">
iniquity: the puni&s;hing of One tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion may prevent an hun|dred tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions. If tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions were not puni&s;hed, men would be bold to commit iniquity; the great de&s;ign of humane puni&s;hments is the prevention of &s;in: <HI>that I&s;rael may hear and fear and doe no more &s;o wickedly.</HI> Abundance of men would carry badly if they dur&s;t: <HI>Rulers are a terrour to evil works, Rom.</HI> 13. 3. So the faithful Preaching of the word is a great means to prevent iniquity: it awa|kens the &s;parks of light that are in the Con&s;ciences of men: it &s;tirs up a principle of Grace where it is: and a principle of natural Con|&s;cience where there is no Grace. Rulers have Opportunity many ways to di&s;countenance &s;in; and thereby to give a check to mens corruptions: the holding the reins of Government &s;trait, bridles men in and re&s;trains them from much evil.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Much of that Sin, which is committed by particular Per&s;ons, will not be imputed to the Land.</HI> Under the be&s;t Government, many times there will be a breaking out of &s;in, though Rulers and People do what they can to prevent it, yet particular per&s;ons will be guilty of flagitious crimes. But if the People doe their duty to inform Rulers, and Rulers theirs in bearing a due te&s;timony again&s;t them&punc; the&s;e are not the &s;ins of the Land; God don't charge the&s;e &s;ins upon the Country: the Country is not guilty of the Crimes of particular Per&s;ons, unle&s;s they make them&s;elves guilty; if they countenance them, or connive at them, they make them&s;elves guilty by participa|tion: But when they are duely witne&s;&s;ed again&s;t, they bring no pub|lick guilt. <HI>Deut.</HI> 13. 5. <HI>So &s;hall thou put away evil from the mid&s;t of thee.</HI></P>
<P>U S E. 1. <HI>See hence that it is matter of great concernment to a Land to have Godly men, to be Rulers in the Common-wealth and in the Church.</HI> Holine&s;s alone will not &s;it men for place of power, but yet it is a very nece&s;&s;ary qualification: Holine&s;s is no in&s;ignificant qua|lity in a Ruler, neither is it a meer Ornament to a Ruler: but it is needful to the welfare of a People, <HI>Exod.</HI> 18. 21. <HI>Thou &s;halt provide out of all the People able men &s;uch as fear God.</HI> Rulers need to be Godly for the Salvation of their own Souls, Rulers need to be Godly for the welfare of the People that are under them. It mu&s;t be ac|knowledged
<PB N="9" REF="001148_0010_0FB093AFCEA07DD8">
that Per&s;ons that are not truly Godly, may be Servi|ceable in a publick Office: but other qualifications do no better &s;up|ply the want of holine&s;s, than a wooden Sword does &s;upply the want of a Sword of Steel. Godline&s;s is a more durable principle: moral qualifications may wear out in time: if mens corruptions are but chained up, they may be &s;et at liberty again: if the unclean &s;pirit be gone out of a man, yet it may return again: Godline&s;s is of more univer&s;al u&s;e, then other qualifications. Re&s;pect to reputation and a de&s;ire to plea&s;e the People, may help in &s;ome particular ca&s;es, but Godline&s;s does more directly &amp; univer&s;ally, &s;tir up Rulers to do their duty: Godline&s;s will pre&s;erve Rulers from running into both ex|treams: Godline&s;s does more powerfully prevail to make them do their duty, then other qualifications: Godline&s;s will prevail over &s;uch temptations, as will prevail over other qualifications: Godline&s;s urges men to their duty upon higher con&s;iderations, than other qua|lifications do: Godly men will not be ea&s;ily flattered, nor ea&s;ily frighted out of their duty: Godline&s;s makes Rulers to be like <HI>Solo|mons</HI> brazen Pillars, which he called <HI>Jachin</HI> and <HI>Boaz:</HI> Godline&s;s is powerful to excite to duty; powerful to vanqui&s;h temptation: Godline&s;s is more powerful to per&s;wade than any Rhetorick, more powerful than the intreaties of friends: Godline&s;s makes men rule their own &s;pirits; it over-rules fears, it over-rules carnal de&s;ires, carnal hopes, carnal pa&s;&s;ions. The work of a Ruler us to carry ho|lily in his place; and holine&s;s is needful to make him carry holily. <HI>He that ruleth over men mu&s;t be ju&s;t, ruling in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ear of God,</HI> 2 Sam. 23. 3.</P>
<P><HI>E&s;pecially it is needful they &s;hould be holy upon the&s;e three accounts.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That they may advance and promote Religion.</HI> It is the duty of Rulers not to tolerate Religion only, but to encourage &amp; advance it; and holy men will be the be&s;t friends to Religion. Holine&s;s makes men love Religion; Holine&s;s makes men hate that which is contrary to Religion: a great part of holine&s;s lies in Religion: if men be Godly they will be Enemies to Here&s;y, Super&s;tition and Prophane&s;s. Godline&s;s will make men concerned for the intere&s;t of Religion: God|line&s;s will make men zealous for the truths of God, &amp; zealous for the

Wor&s;hip of God; if men be godly, they will be careful that God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e honoured, they will be careful that means be u&s;ed to make men godly, and to comfort tho&s;e that are godly. Religious Prin|ciples, and Religious Practices &s;uit a godly heart. Others may advance Religion for vain glory, from fear, from the workings of natural con&s;cience; the&s;e will do it out of love: Such men will be Nur&s;ing Fathers to the Church. Tho&s;e men that fear God, will promote the fear of God in the Land. If <HI>Saul</HI> do &s;omething to advance the Wor&s;hip of God, <HI>David</HI> will do more; if <HI>Jehu</HI> do &s;omething, <HI>Jeho&s;aphat, Hezekiah, Jo&s;iah</HI> will do more. <HI>Jehu</HI> had a mind that <HI>Jonadab</HI> &s;hould &s;ee his zeal for the Lord, but all <HI>I&s;ra|el</HI> might plainly &s;ee that he wanted zeal for the Lord.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Holine&s;s is needful, that Rulers may &s;uppre&s;s &s;inful practices.</HI> The Angel of the Church of <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> could not bear them that were evil. If men be indeed Godly, they will be afraid of the Judgments of God, becau&s;e of the &s;ins of the Land, and labour to &s;uppre&s;s them. Holy Rulers will be reforming Rulers, Holy Ru|lers will be no Enemies to Reformation: Holy men will not be in|different about Reformation; they will be careful to prevent &s;in, and faithful to puni&s;h &s;in: that which is contrary to holine&s;s, is contrary to the &s;pirit of holy men: Holine&s;s will make men care|ful to find out what is provoking to God, and careful to &s;uppre&s;s it. Holy men look upon &s;inful practices not only a di&s;honour to God, but the very things that do undermine the peace and Welfare of the Land: The Corruptions of a people are like di&s;ea&s;es in the natural body; and holy Rulers, like careful Phy&s;icians, will labour after a cure. Holine&s;s in Rulers makes them to be men of zeal, and men of courage for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ing of &s;in. <HI>Job.</HI> 31. 34. <HI>Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept &s;ilence, and went not out of the door.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Holine&s;s is needful, that men may do that which is ju&s;t between man and man.</HI> When there is no temptation, unholy men may do that which is ju&s;t; but when there is temptation, holine&s;s is a great help to ju&s;tice. Some men favour the Plantiff, to bring gri&s;s to their mill; but holy men will look on Plantiff and Defendant in|differently:

If Rulers do not their duty, God will plead the cau&s;e of the people; if the people do not their duty, God will plead the cau&s;e of the Rulers; if neither Rulers nor Ruled do their duty, God will vindicate the Rule.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>If Rulers be carele&s;s in promoting Religion and Morality, God will puni&s;h the Land.</HI> Rulers are to be keepers of both tables; and as they mu&s;t practice Religion and Morality them&s;elves, &s;o they mu&s;t take care that the people do it; they mu&s;t u&s;e all proper means, for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of Here&s;y, Prophane&s;s &amp; Super&s;tition &amp; other Corruptions in Wor&s;hip; it was the great commendation of <HI>He|zekiah, Jo&s;iah,</HI> and <HI>Nehemiah</HI> that they were careful in this matter; &s;ometimes Rulers through ignorance do countenance &s;uch Doctrines, and Wor&s;hip, as are cro&s;s unto the Word of God; &s;ometimes their hearts are &s;o taken up about other concernments and injoyments, that they neglect the promoting of Religion; &s;ometimes they want zeal in the cau&s;e of God, and chu&s;e rather to live quietly, then to be at the trouble to rectifie &s;uch things as are ami&s;s; &s;o though &s;omething be done for the redre&s;&s;ing of moral evils, yet not &s;o much as might and ought to be: So if Mini&s;ters in their pla|ces are &s;lighty, and don't lay out them&s;elves according to expec|tation,

&s;uch as are to be Leaders in Church or Common-wealth: It was a great advantage to the Sons of the Prophets, that <HI>Samuel</HI> was ap|pointed over them, and that in after-times, they were under the Tuition of <HI>Elijah</HI> and <HI>Eli&s;ha.</HI> The <HI>Colledge</HI> has been a great ble&s;&s;ing to the Country, and if due care be taken it may be &s;o &s;till. In|deed no Education is &s;ufficient without Gods ble&s;&s;ing; but howe|ver great care &s;hould be taken, that &s;uch per&s;ons may have a good foundation of Learning; &s;o likewi&s;e that they be not tainted with any Heterodoxies, and that their hearts may be &s;ea&s;oned with the fear of God. Places of Learning &s;hould not be Places of Riot and Pride: wayes of profu&s;ene&s;s and prodigality in &s;uch a Society, lay a foundation of a great deal of &s;orrow; fond and proud Parents &s;hould not be &s;uffered to introduce evil cu&s;tomes; 'tis not worth the while for per&s;ons to be &s;ent to the <HI>Colledge</HI> to learn to Complement men, and Court Women; they &s;hould be &s;ent thither to prepare them for Publick Service, and had need be under the over-&s;ight of wi&s;e and ho|ly men.

<P>If there be not due care taken, one of the&s;e two things are like to follow: Either,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That per&s;ons will not be improved in Publick Service, after Parents have been at great expence to bring them up.</HI> It is an heavy thing to many Pa|rents to be&s;tow Accademical Education on their Children, and as it is ordered, it is a great deal heavier than it needs to be; the whole Fa|mily is fain to pinch that they may go through with it: And it is a great di&s;appointment, when after all, the per&s;on is laid a&s;ide as unwor|thy of improvement; the Money might have been &s;pent to far great|er advantage, in another way: But this is a private calamity, the next is publick.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Or el&s;e per&s;ons will be improved that are tainted with evil habits.</HI> I readily grant, that what Errors &s;oever there be in the way of mens E|ducation, God may in Sovereign mercy pre&s;erve &s;ome from being tain|ted, and recover others that are tainted. But if due care be not taken of the Education of &s;uch, it is without que&s;tion, that many will be improved, that are tainted with ill properties. Churches mu&s;t take up with &s;uch as they can get, that that is wanting cannot be numbred: And &s;ome men by intere&s;t and religious &s;hews, will get into improve|ment, that are not very fit for it, this will prove an undoing thing unto the Land.

<P>U S E. IV. Of Exhortation, <HI>To Rulers and Ruled, to do your Duty to One another.</HI> You profe&s;s a de&s;ire of the Pro&s;perity and Happine&s;s of the Country: and we have rea&s;on to de&s;ire it e&s;pecially upon the&s;e two Account; One is, becau&s;e we are the Lords People: A People planted in this Wilderne&s;s upon the Account of Religion, and have been &s;ignally owned by God, and had many tokens of his pre|&s;ence. The other is, the Intere&s;t that we have in the Land: for our Own &s;ake and the &s;ake of our Children, our Kindred and our Acquaintance. We have rea&s;on to de&s;ire its Welfare. <HI>David</HI> &s;ayes, <HI>For my Brethren and Companions &s;ake I will &s;ay, Peace be within thee, P&s;al.</HI> 122. 8. <HI>Joab</HI> makes u&s;e of the&s;e two Arguments, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 10. 12. <HI>Let us play the men for our People and the Cities of our God.</HI> Let us upon the&s;e two Con&s;iderations &s;eek the Pro&s;perity of the Country. And in Or|der to it, Let Rulers and Ruled do their duty one towards another. There may be many ways of Prudence propo&s;ed, to advance the Wealth and Safety of the Land, but this is a &s;pecial means to promote our Happine&s;s: L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> the fifth Command be kept, and your Lives will be long in the Land which the Lord our God giveth you.</P>
<P>Particularly 1. <HI>To Rulers in the Common-wealth.</HI> Let me direct my Speech to Your EXCELLENCY, the Honoured COUNCIL, and the re&s;t of the Gentlemen of the General A&s;&s;embly, together with others who hear a part in the Government; Do Your Duty to the People. And &s;uffer me to remember you of a few Rules.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Be good Examples.</HI> You mu&s;t be Examples of Piety, Humility, Sobriety, Cha&s;tity, and all vertuous carriages. Good Examples teach men their duty, good examples &s;tir up tho&s;e &s;parks of light that are in the Con&s;ciences of other men, good examples provoke to emulation; and it is e&s;pecially needful for Rulers to give good examples. Holi|ne&s;s in Rulers is like a precious &s;tone &s;et in gold, their Dignity &s;ets it off with greater lu&s;tre: Holy Carriages in Rulers make the people honour them; they can't but honour &s;uch in their hearts: Holy Carriages in Rulers make the people fear them: Holy Carria|ges in Rulers have a magnetick vertue to draw others to do the like. People will follow their example, that they may be like them, and
<PB N="15" REF="001148_0016_0FB093BD82474468">
that they may be liked by them. When Rulers give good examples, men cannot make their carriages to be an argument for the lawfulne&s;s of their &s;inful ways; they cannot take occa&s;ion from their carriages to be bold to &s;in. Good Examples in Rulers bring good carriages into cre|dit &amp; into fa&s;hion: Good Examples in Rulers are a comfort &amp; confir|mation to them that are good, and a bridle to them that are evil: Holy Examples in Rulers prevent their reproach; when others car|ry badly, men can't &s;ay their Rulers harden them; when men com|mend you for your skill and knowledge, they will have no occa&s;ion to &s;ay, what pitty is it, that you don't carry well; when you puni&s;h o|ther men, they can't &s;ay, you have more need to look at home.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>In promoting men to Place of Power, have a &s;pecial re&s;pect to Godline&s;s.</HI> You don't certainly know who are Godly, but you mu&s;t be careful to promote tho&s;e that appear to be &s;uch: Godline&s;s alone is not a &s;uffi|cient qualification for rule, but it is one principal thing to be re&s;pect|ed. If Wealth alone would fit men for Rule, <HI>Nabal</HI> would have been a fit man; if Parentage alone would fit men, the Sons of <HI>Samuel</HI> would have been very &s;uitable per&s;ons. Men that are of loo&s;e Con|ver&s;ation are not fit for the honour of Government: <HI>Honour is not &s;eem|ly for a fool.</HI> Tho&s;e men are not to be advanced to Place, that are not fit to do the work of their place: Artificers make u&s;e of &s;uch tools as are proper for their work: They that break Laws are not fit to be tru&s;ted with the Execution of Laws. Men had need be careful into who&s;e hands they put the Sword of Ju&s;tice, men that can't rule them|&s;elves, are not fit to rule others; it is well for the World, that he that has the Supream Power over all, is Holy and Righteous; and it would be better for the World than it is, if Inferiour Rulers were all like him. Rulers are called Gods, and it is pitty that they that are like him in Power, are not like him in Holine&s;s al&s;o. 2 Sam. 23. 3. <HI>He that Ruleth over men, mu&s;t be ju&s;t, Ruling in the Fear of God.</HI> If Good men be &s;o &s;carce in the Country, that there is a nece&s;&s;ity of Choo&s;ing bad men to place of Rule, the condition of the Land is to be lamented.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Do not lay unnece&s;&s;ary burdens on the People, yet be willing to Expend what is nece&s;&s;ary.</HI> When People are put to unnece&s;&s;ary charge, they are Oppre&s;&s;ed, and when they are Oppre&s;&s;ed they are abu&s;ed: it is directly contrary to the Office of Rulers, to lay heavy burdens on the People: One great part of their Office is to redre&s;s the Injuries of others: a People are in a bad condition, when they that &s;hould be Bullwarks to them to pre&s;erve them from the Injurious carriages of others, are Pilla|ging of them them&s;elves: When their Shepherds prove like Evening

Wolves. If the Country were Richer than it is, yet it were an abu&s;e to put them to unnece&s;&s;ary charge: But yet you may not decline any nece&s;&s;ary Expence: What is nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;afety of the Land mu&s;t be laid out. The Common-wealth of <HI>Carthage</HI> and the Empire of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> were lo&s;t through the Penuriou&s;ne&s;s of the People. So what is needful for the Support of the Government mu&s;t be laid out. I judge a Governour may live more happily here, though his Main|tenance be not altogether &s;o great than in any other of the Engli&s;h Plantations in <HI>America,</HI> becau&s;e of the advantage of good Society and Spiritual Opportunities; yet it is very fit that the Governour &s;hould be Honourably Supported. The GOVERNOUR'S work is Great and his Power is Great, and his Encouragement &s;hould be proportionable: it would be a Temptation to mo&s;t men, to have a great Title, if their income did not hold &s;ome proportion. Men &s;pend a great deal for their own honour; more than half of many mens Expences is for their honour; men &s;pend a great deal that they may have honoura|ble Hou&s;es, honourable Hou&s;hold-&s;tuff, have honourable Apparel, keep <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n honourable Table, <HI>&amp;c;</HI> and it is very meet that in Maintaining the Governour, they &s;hould have a re&s;pect to the honour of the QUEEN, and the honour of the Country. The managing of the Government with Fidelity and Wi&s;dom, does &s;o much conduce to the Welfare of the People, that they may well afford a Liberal Maintainance as a reward of it. Let not the Governour fare the wor&s;e, for being Born and Bred among us. I hope that will be done, that will cut off all Occa&s;ions of jealou&s;y, and manife&s;t a Spirit of hearty Love, and oblige unto reciprocal acts of love.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Labour that &s;uch things as are Provoking to God may be Reformed.</HI> God has had a great Controver&s;y with the Country for many years; the Judgments of God have dimini&s;hed the Country, and have impo|veri&s;hed the Country. I do judge that a third part of that income, that the Country has had or might with an ordinary ble&s;&s;ing have had, the&s;e Forty years, has been taken away by the Judgments of God. There is therefore great need that you &s;hould Labour in the Work of Reformation. Labour then to Reform the Prophane&s;s, the Pride, and Sen&s;uality of the Land: there have been &s;everal attempts that way, but they have had a mi&s;carrying Womb. Attempts for Reformation, have been like attempts to find the Philo&s;ophers Stone. Indeed it is a mat|ter of great difficulty to bring the Country to Reformation. We are much to &s;eek what &s;hould be Reformed: Sinful practices have not only got power over mens Affections, but over their Under&s;tandings al&s;o.
<PB N="17" REF="001148_0018_0FB093C1509F18B0">
That which &s;ome count Sinful others count indifferent; that which &s;ome count Sinful others count Duty: there is a mi&s;t before the eyes of men: <HI>men put darkne&s;s for light and light for darkne&s;s,</HI> I&s;a. 5. 20.

Yea many People are very dull to advance Reformation; it is a trouble&s;ome work and attended with a great deal of Temptation: but yet there is a ne|ce&s;&s;ity of Reforming in order to our Peace with God. Keeping a Fa&s;t Day now and then will not &s;erve the turn: Reformation is the condi|tion of the Publick Covenant between God and the Land; and it is, your Duty to lead in it: it is not enough to Wi&s;h for it and Pray for it, but you mu&s;t improve your Power that way.

It is to be lamented that many men are grown ignorant of the doctrine of Regeneration.

Regeneration is nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation, <HI>Joh.</HI> 3. 3. Re&s;training Grace is not &s;ufficient in order to eternal life; yea there mu&s;t be a good mea&s;ure of inward Piety, in order to the reforming of the Land: if there be not, a peo|ple may Reform in a pang, but they will return to their vomit again. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 78. 37. <HI>They were not &s;teadfa&s;t in his Covenant:</HI> if they do re|form &s;ome particular &s;in in an abiding way, as the Jews did, the &s;in of Idolatry, after the Babyloni&s;h Captivity, yet there will not be a general Reformation without it.

real Piety in the Land, neither regard to reputation, nor the &s;afety of their Souls will make them carry well: if the Country &s;hould have many Judgments, that would not bring an Unconverted People unto Reformation, Judgments will &s;ooner de&s;troy the Bodies of men and the E&s;tates of men, then their Lu&s;ts; it is an ea&s;ier matter to break the bones of men, then the hearts of men. <HI>Pharaoh</HI> had ten Plagues, but they did not cure him of the Plague of his heart.

Some are apt to depend upon the judg|ment of men, under a notion that they are Wi&s;e and Learned: &s;ome under a notion that they have much of the pre&s;ence of God: But we may not depend upon the judgments of men that are Dead, neither may we depend upon the judgments of men that are alive; we may not depend upon the judgment of &s;ingle men, neither may we depend upon the judgment of Societies of men. There are two ways that men depend upon the judgments of men, One is when they e&s;pou&s;e an opinion becau&s;e men are of that judgment, that is the preponde|rating con&s;ideration, and that which over-ballances that which is &s;aid again&s;t it: they have little to &s;ay for it, others have much to &s;ay again&s;t it, but this turns the Scale with them, that &s;uch men &s;ay &s;o. There be many men that can't tell how to take pains to &s;earch the Scripture, that is a matter of labour and difficulty to &s;earch out the truth, and they had rather take things upon tru&s;t. The other is when men e&s;pou&s;e an Opinion, becau&s;e others judge it is the mean|ing

of &s;uch and &s;uch Scriptures; &s;ome men think they do not de|pend upon the judgment of men, but upon the word of God; &amp; they can alledge ten Scriptures for their Opinion. If they did know that to be the meaning of the Scripture, they would &s;ay true, but it may be they don't know that to be the meaning of one of tho&s;e Scriptures: but they depend upon mens interpretation of them; and the mean|ing of them is utterly perverted: we mu&s;t take no Principles upon tru&s;t from men, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 8. 17. <HI>To the Law and to the Te&s;timony.</HI> It co&s;t the young Prophet dear that he took a liberty upon tru&s;t from the <HI>Old Prophet of Bethel,</HI> I <HI>King.</HI> 13. 23, 24.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Don't comply with the Vanity and Luxury of the Age.</HI> We live in a corrupt age, and multitudes of men take a licentious liberty, in their Drinking and Apparel, and Company, and Recreations, and Un&s;avoury Di&s;cour&s;es; and Mini&s;ters living in an infectious air, are in danger to be infected al&s;o, &amp; they &amp; their Families are ready to be carryed away with the di&s;&s;imulation: this proves a great temptation; &s;ometimes it works upon the Mini&s;ter, makes him to wave di&s;cour&s;es about tho&s;e things; and if he do bear a Te&s;timony again&s;t &s;uch things, the People lay little weight upon it, they think it is &s;poken <HI>diciscau&s;a,</HI> the Mini&s;ter can coin &s;ome di&s;tinction to vindicate him&s;elf, but the People cannot under&s;tand it: if the Mini&s;ter take too much liberty, the People will take more, many of them will venture farther than he, let him venture as far as he dare: if the People judge his practice warrantable, they will imitate it, if unwarrantable they will be &s;can|dalized: 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4. 3. <HI>Be thou an example to the believers, in word, in conver&s;ation, in charity, in &s;pirit, in faith, in purity.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Keep the Wor&s;hip of God pure.</HI> Confine your &s;elves to that Wor&s;hip and tho&s;e Ordinances, that God has in&s;tituted: Mens ad|ditions will not perfect Gods in&s;titutions: all additions to in&s;tituted Wor&s;hip are Corruptions. When men take upon them to add to the wor&s;hip of God, it may be &s;aid to them, who gave you this Au|thority: God don't leave it to the wit of man to devi&s;e ways of wor&s;hip: it is not fit that &s;uch Power &s;hould be put into the hands of men, as to appoint what wor&s;hip God &s;hall be contented with and accept: Men in taking &s;uch power, take upon them to rule God.

<P N="3">3. <HI>To the People:</HI> Carry to your Rulers according to your Duty.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Don't murmur again&s;t them.</HI> The Children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> often fell into this &s;in, and they &s;marted for it. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10. 10. <HI>Neither Mur|mur you as &s;ome of them murmured, and were de&s;troy'd of the De&s;troy|er. Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Aaron</HI> were as good Leaders as a people could de|&s;ire, yet they could not e&s;cape the &s;courge of the tongue: then men murmur again&s;t Leaders when they complain of them without cau&s;e&punc; though they think with <HI>Jonah,</HI> that they do well to be an|gry. Sometimes they complain of Rulers, when there are nece&s;&s;a|ry burdens laid upon them, and &s;ometimes when they have not &s;ucce&s;s, though Rulers are not in fault: &s;o they murmur when they complain more than they have rea&s;on to do; when they aggravate the failings and mi&s;takes of Rulers beyond mea&s;ure: they mur|mur al&s;o, when in their complaints, they talk rudely and rebel|liou&s;ly: the&s;e murmurings are the froth of a di&s;contented &s;pirit; Murmurers are like the raging Sea, that ca&s;ts forth mire &amp; dirt: Murmuring weakens the hands of Rulers, is a preparation for Se|dition, and a degree of Rebellion: Murmurers pretend to be great &s;ufferers, but be &s;ure, they are great Sinners: <HI>The&s;e are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lu&s;ts, Jude</HI> 16. Men that mur|mur again&s;t their Rulers, &s;hew an unruly and ungoverned &s;pirit. When men murmur again&s;t their Rulers, it is no wonder if God

plead for them by his Judgments, if Rulers mi&s;s it, it is better to tell them humbly of it, and to bewail it before God, then to make a noi&s;e and uproar about it, inflaming one anothers &s;pirits.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>A&s;&s;i&s;t your Rulers.</HI> It is impo&s;&s;ible for Rulers to keep a peo|ple in order without their help: the Rulers are but few in compa|ri&s;on, and the Ends of Government will never be an&s;wered with|out the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the People. Military Officers may as ea&s;ily vanqui&s;h Enemies without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of their Souldiers, as Ru|lers in the Common-wealth can keep a people in order without their help; he &s;ays to <HI>Ezra, We al&s;o will be with thee, be of good courage and do it,</HI> Ezra 10. 4. There are two ways in &s;pecial, where|in the people are to a&s;&s;i&s;t their Rulers: One is, by Governing their own families well; if Family Government be neglected, a people will grow wicked, notwith&s;tanding the faithful endeavours of pub|lick Rulers: Good Government in Families does much facilitate the work of Publick Rulers; if Families be not well Governed, a Coun|try will be filled with wickedne&s;s. If Children be not taught at home, they will not profit much by publick teaching; if they be not well governed at home, the burden of Rulers will be intolera|ble: Errors in the fir&s;t concoction, will not be mended in the &s;e|cond; if we have rude families, we &s;hall have a rude Country: but if per&s;ons be well trained up in families, Publick Rulers will not have &s;o much trouble with them. <HI>Prov.</HI> 22. 6. <HI>Train up a Child in the way he &s;hould go, and when he is old, he will not depart from it.</HI> Another way of a&s;&s;i&s;ting Rulers, is by informing of &s;uch mi&s;car|riages as Rulers mu&s;t witne&s;s again&s;t. Sometimes people are ve|ry backward to do their duty that way; in ordinary ca&s;es if they can bring Offenders to repentance privately, they do their duty; but they neither do that, nor make tho&s;e in Authority acquaint|ed with it; they are unconcerned about the honour of God, and reformation of the Land, they are loth to anger men, cannot abide to give them&s;elves trouble; are afraid that others will com|plain of them, and &s;o they neglect their duty. Abundance of wickedne&s;s, Swearing, Drunkenne&s;s, and Sin goes unpuni&s;hed, becau&s;e people neglect to give information to Rulers: Some
<PB N="22" REF="001148_0023_0FB093CAB2C97AE8">
things are &s;ecret becau&s;e men cannot inform; the&s;e do not bring guilt upon the Land: Other things are &s;ecret, becau&s;e men will not inform.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Be not cau&s;ele&s;ly jealous of your Rulers.</HI> Some men pretend to be wi&s;er than others, and they throw out hints of bad de|&s;igns, and many times tho&s;e things will &s;pread like a grangreen among the people; one would think they were troubled with the &s;pleen, and over-run with melancholly: If they would &s;et their rea&s;on on work, they might free them&s;elves from &s;uch jealou|&s;ies. If a man will &s;u&s;pect that the Stars will fall, who can hinder him: but men do ill when they give way to &s;uch a &s;pi|rit. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13. 5. <HI>Charity thinketh no evil:</HI> Cau&s;ele&s;s jealou&s;ies are injurious; &s;uch things are a great provocation to men of ho|ne&s;t intention; &s;ometimes they do exa&s;perate, and &s;ometimes they do di&s;courage the hearts of Rulers: by &s;uch practices, people throw them&s;elves into temptation, they di&s;turb their own &s;pirits, and make them&s;elves unea&s;y under the Government. So if people entertain jealou&s;ies of their Mini&s;ters, that they de&s;ign to introduce corruptions in the Churches, they will grow trouble&s;ome and vexatious: it is an ill &s;pirit when mens acti|ons are fair to accu&s;e them of bad de&s;igns; they act the part of <HI>Sanballat, faining things out of their own hearts, Neh.</HI> 6. 8.</P>
<P>USE. V. <HI>It is a great mercy when God does prepare the hearts of Rulers and Ruled to do their duty to one another.</HI> If they do their duty, they will prevent many Judgments, if they do not; they will bring Judgment. Therefore it is a great mer|cy, when God does prepare them to do their duty; if they be not prepared to do their duty, they will not do it; there will fall out a multitude of occa&s;ions, to make them neglect their duty. If they be told of their duty, and urged to do it, yet they will not do it; if they be not prepared to do it: if they &s;uffer much for the neglect of their duty, they will not do it, if their hearts be not prepared. If the hearts of a people be pre|pared, they will do their duty, though it be attended with much
<PB N="23" REF="001148_0024_0FB093CC33F37040">
difficulty. So in <HI>Hezekiahs</HI> time, <HI>They clean&s;ed the hou&s;e of God &s;ud|denly, and offered up many oblations, becau&s;e God had prepared the People,</HI> 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 29. 36. So if God prepares the hearts of Rulers and Ruled to do their duty to one another, they will do it.</P>
<P>There are two ways e&s;pecially by which God does prepare them to do their duty.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> giving tender Con&s;ciences unto them.</HI> There is a two-fold tenderne&s;s of Con&s;cience; there is a legal tenderne&s;s of Con&s;cience from the illumination of mens natural Con&s;ciences, whereby they are afraid to do any thing that may bring down the wrath of God. And there is a gracious tenderne&s;s of Con&s;cience, from the Sancti|fication of the heart, whereby men are not only afraid of Judgment, but of doing any thing that will be a di&s;honour unto God: Both of the&s;e are u&s;eful, e&s;pecially the latter: and the more there is of it the better it is: this makes men afraid to do any thing that they know to be &s;inful; this makes men afraid to do any thing that they &s;u&s;pect to be &s;inful; a tender Con&s;cience is a &s;pur to &s;tir men up to their duty, and as a bridle to re&s;train men from evil. If the Con&s;ciences of Rulers be tender, that will help them again&s;t all &s;orts of temptation: if they have provocation, yet they will not dare to neglect their duty. <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> had been provoked by his Bre|thren, but he &s;ays to them, <HI>Fear not I will nouri&s;h you and your lit|tle ones, and he comforted them and &s;pake kindly to them, Gen.</HI> 50. 21. If they have opportunity to make a prey of other per&s;ons, they wont do it. <HI>Job would not lift up his hand again&s;t the Fatherle&s;s, when he &s;aw his help in the gate; for de&s;truction from God was a terrour to him, Job</HI> 31. 21, 23. If their Con&s;ciences be tender they will do their duty, though they expo&s;e them&s;elves to danger. <HI>Job</HI> 31. 34. <HI>Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me.</HI> A tender Con&s;cience will make them to be nur&s;ing Fathers to the Church: if their Con&s;ciences be tender, they will be &s;en&s;ible of the wrath of God again&s;t the Country, and &s;trive after Reformation. So it was with <HI>Jo&s;iah: His heart was tender and he did humble him|&s;elf before God, when he heard his words again&s;t that place,</HI> 2 <HI>Chron.</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="001148_0025_0FB093CDA12569A0">
34. 27. So if the people have tender Con&s;ciences, they will be prepared to do their duty to their Rulers; if their Con&s;ciences be hardned, and there comes a &s;uitable temptation, they wont regard to give that honour to Rulers that they owe to them. <HI>I&s;rael</HI> in the wilderne&s;s oftentimes affronted <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Aaron:</HI> they will talk extravagantly and act rebelliou&s;ly, and have more regard to their own will, than to Gods Laws; there is no &s;ecurity that a People that do not fear God, will carry well to their Rulers: but if their Con&s;ciences be tender, they will have a tender care to do their duty to their Rulers; if their Con&s;ciences be tender, they will check them for any thing that is contrary to that reverence and obedience, that they owe to their Rulers. <HI>Davids heart &s;mote him becau&s;e he had cut off Sauls skirt,</HI> 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 24. 5. If their Con&s;ciences be ten|der, the words of God will be like goads quickning them to their duty: <HI>Levi feared God and was afraid before his name, Mal.</HI> 2. 5. And that made him attend the command of <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>By making them drink in good Principles.</HI> A tender Con&s;ci|ence mi&s;guided may run a man into great mi&s;carriages; if men be under mi&s;takes and judge that lawful which is unlawful, that gives them a liberty to &s;in; if they judge that duty which is &s;inful, their Con&s;ciences will urge them to commit iniquity: but if their Con&s;ciences be tender and their Judgments rightly informed, they will then attend their duty, tender Con&s;ciences will make them de|&s;ign their duty, and good Principles will pre&s;erve them from mi&s;tak|ing it. A man that is well di&s;po&s;ed, may under one &s;pecious pre|tence or other be led into abundance of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion: but if he be well principled that will keep him in a right way, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 119. 104. <HI>Through thy Precepts I get under&s;tanding, therefore I hate every fal&s;e way.</HI> There be many bad Principles that men drink&punc; in re&s;|pecting matters of Morality. Some run into one extream, and they judge ways of Licentiou&s;ne&s;s lawful, they have lo&s;t a pretty deal of the light of nature, and cannot di&s;tingui&s;h between good and evil. Some run into the other extream, and make &s;trick rules for them&s;elves and others that God never made. Many men have
<PB N="25" REF="001148_0026_0FB093CFC8171350">
bad Principles re&s;pecting the Wor&s;hip of God: &s;ome allow too much to the authority of men: and &s;ome allow too much to the judgments of men; as if they were in their Nonage or Dotage, that they don't know to chu&s;e the good and refu&s;e the evil: Some have bad Principles re&s;pecting the Relative duties of Rulers and Ruled. Such things open a door to much tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion: there are many ways whereby per&s;ons come to be ill Principled: &s;ome by their Conver&s;ation with men of bad Principles; &s;ome by hearkening to the voice of carnal affections; &s;ome by being too tenacious of old Traditions; &s;ome by being given to change. We &s;hould attend the light of Nature, &s;earch the Scriptures, and beg the teachings of the Spirit of God. If men of tender Con&s;ciences were well Principled, they would carry well: if <HI>Paul</HI> had not been under a mi&s;take, he would not have Per&s;ecuted the Church; if <HI>David</HI> had not been under a mi&s;take, he would not have put the Ark into a Cart: if the Church at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> had not been under a mi&s;take, they would not have contended with <HI>Peter,</HI> for eating with tho&s;e that were Uncircumci&s;ed, <HI>Act.</HI> 11. 2, 3. If Rulers have tender Con&s;ciences, and be convinced of their duty to the People, they will carefully attend it; and if the People have tender Con&s;ciences, and be convinced of their duty to their Rulers, they will carefully attend it; and &s;o your Lives will be Long in the Land which the LORD your GOD hath given you.</P>
