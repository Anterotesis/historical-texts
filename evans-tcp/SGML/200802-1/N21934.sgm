<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE ob&s;ervations contained in the following pages, were made during the time that I lived in Jamaica, or while I attended &s;ome part of the army in America. The materials were collected between the years 1774 and 1782; and the pre&s;ent performance would have been offered to the public before this time, had I &s;ooner &s;ound lei&s;ure to at|tend to the bu&s;ine&s;s of publication. The in&s;ufficiency of Dr. Hillary's work, the mo&s;t e&s;teemed book on the di&s;ea&s;es of the We&s;t Indies, and the only one with
<PB N="vi" REF="028890_0004_0FDE67838770BD48">
which I was acquainted while I remained in that country, furni&s;hed me with a motive for the undertaking; a motive, which may be thought, perhaps, no longer to exi&s;t, as two treati&s;es have been publi&s;hed lately by Dr. Hunter and Dr. Mo&s;eley, expre&s;sly on the di&s;ea&s;es of which I have written. I might remark, that the pre&s;ent attempt, &s;uch as it is, was nearly completed before the trea|ti&s;es to which I allude came to my hands. The views which they afford of fevers, as they differ from each other, &s;o they likewi&s;e differ from tho&s;e which I have ventured to advance. I have weighed their merits maturely, and cannot &s;ay that I di&s;cover any information, which gives me cau&s;e to change tho&s;e opinions which I had formed, or which renders the publication of the pre&s;ent work
<PB N="vii" REF="028890_0005_0FDE678505FD8DD8">
unnece&s;&s;ary. I may ob&s;erve, that Dr. Hunter details, with candour and per|&s;picuity, the mode of practice, which was followed by the mo&s;t re&s;pectable medical people of Jamaica, at the time that I lived in the i&s;land. He perhaps pre&s;cribes the bark in larger quantities, than was then cu&s;tomary; but I do not perceive any thing in the plan of treat|ment e&s;&s;entially new; neither will Dr. Mo&s;eley, though he pur&s;ues innovation with great eagerne&s;s, be better able to e&s;tabli&s;h his claim to original di&s;cove|ries. The plentiful and long continued purging, on which he places a con&s;ider|able &s;hare of his merit, has been a fa|vourite practice with numbers for many years pa&s;t; and the free u&s;e of the lancet, which he recommends &s;o much in fevers, was employed in &s;everal di&s;tricts of
<PB N="viii" REF="028890_0006_0FDE678687430A10">
Jamaica, before this author's name was known. Dr. Spence, a practitioner of &s;ome eminence at Lucea, in the We&s;tern extremity of the i&s;land, wrote a pam|phlet (I believe in the year 1776) with a view to enforce its &s;afety and utility, in promoting the cure of the general cla&s;s of febrile di&s;ea&s;es. The publica|tion was well received, and &s;erved to re|move the dread of the lancet, which &s;ome people till then had fal&s;ely entertained.</P>
<P>I have thus explained the motive which induced me to write; and I leave it to people of experience to judge of the manner in which I have executed the ta&s;k. I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that, when I fir&s;t intended to prepare my ob&s;erva|tions for the in&s;pection of the public, I had no other de&s;ign than to mention
<PB N="ix" REF="028890_0007_0FDE678F86E03D18">
&s;uch circum&s;tances in the hi&s;tory and cure of fevers, as did not appear to be generally known. Having &s;pent the earlier part of my life in &s;ituations, which did not admit of a continued plan of &s;tudy, I had not till lately much ac|quaintance with the opinions of medical writers. About four years ago, when I found a &s;ettled abode, I began occa|&s;ionally to look into the works of the ancient phy&s;icians. In examining Hip|pocrates, I di&s;covered &s;uch a &s;imilarity in the fevers of the Archipelago, with tho&s;e of Jamaica, that I &s;u&s;pended my de&s;ign of publi&s;hing, till I &s;hould have given that author's writings a careful peru&s;al. I &s;oon was convinced that many ob&s;ervations, which I had con&s;i|dered as my own, were actually known to this father of phy&s;ic; and though I
<PB N="x" REF="028890_0008_0FDE6791726ACCA0">
was probably di&s;appointed in being an|ticipated in offering &s;omething new to the public, I was &s;till gratified by the coincidence of remark, that gave me a confidence in my accuracy which other|wi&s;e I dur&s;t not have a&s;&s;umed. After I had carefully peru&s;ed the writings of Hippocrates, I con&s;ulted and compared &s;uch other of the Greek phy&s;icians, as I was able to procure. I even de&s;cended with a &s;imilar examination to the pre|&s;ent times; but as my collection of me|dical writers, particularly of modern ones, is &s;mall, I have probably omitted &s;ome who ought to have been men|tioned, or perhaps advanced ob&s;erva|tions as my own, which in reality be|long to others. If I have done &s;o, I mu&s;t be allowed to &s;ay, that I have done it without con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s.</P>

It may appear, perhaps, that I have treated the opinions of great names with too little re&s;pect; but if facts have at any time occurred to me, which contradict e&s;tabli&s;hed theories, I &s;hould hope that the&s;e facts will be examined before they are rejected. No medical authority ought to prevail over the cer|tain evidence of truth. I am not con|&s;cious of having mi&s;repre&s;ented, for the &s;ake of a theory, the minute&s;t circum|&s;tance of what I have actually &s;een;&mdash;if I have been mi&s;taken in any in&s;tance in forming conclu&s;ions, I &s;hall receive the correction of my inaccuracies with gratitude.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. OF THE GENERAL CHARACTER OF THE REMIT|TING FEVER OF JAMAICA.</HEAD>
<P>AS it is perfectly well known, that fevers, which are e&s;&s;entially in them&s;elves the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e, vary in their appearances, from difference of climate and &s;ea&s;on, it would be very &s;uperfluous to attempt any proof of what is &s;o generally acknowledged. Even Hippocrates, who lived more than two thou&s;and years ago, does not &s;eem to have been unacquainted with this fact. This indu&s;trious phy&s;ician, as we learn from many pa&s;&s;ages in his works, not only vi&s;ited the various i&s;lands in the AEgean Sea; but travelled like|wi&s;e into various parts of the adjacent continents. The motive of his journeys, we are taught to believe, was principally to ob&s;erve the different &s;ituation of places, and to mark their corre&s;ponding di&s;ea&s;es. He has de&s;cribed very fully, in a curious and u&s;eful treati&s;e, the effects of air and local &s;ituation on the human frame; and in the hi&s;tory of fevers, related in the books of Epidemics, has &s;eldom forgotten to mention, not only the general con&s;titution of the &s;ea&s;ons with re|&s;pect to di&s;ea&s;es; but likewi&s;e the nature of the cli|mate, where his ob&s;ervations were more particularly made. The &s;pecies of fevers, it is true, that are found in the writings of Hippocrates are extremely multi|plied; yet this author &s;eems &s;till to have been clearly of opinion, that di&s;ea&s;es, which are e&s;&s;entially <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he &s;ame, a&s;&s;ume, in &s;ome re&s;pects, a different appearance in the i&s;land of Tha&s;us, and at Abdera, on the contiguous
<PB N="2" REF="028890_0011_0FDE679AC5EB51E0">
coa&s;t of Thrace. Ob&s;ervations to the &s;ame effect have been made by many others in different parts of the world; nor is the fact capable of being better il|lu&s;trated in any country than in Jamaica; where a very &s;mall change of place, or the ordinary revolution of &s;ea&s;ons, are often ob&s;erved to influence in a high degree, the appearances of the common endemic of that i&s;land. But this ob&s;ervation,&mdash;that local &s;itua|tion and the change of &s;ea&s;ons, are the cau&s;e of varie|ties in the appearances of the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e, has been &s;o long known, that it is almo&s;t unnece&s;&s;ary to men|tion it; nor would it have been repeated now; unle&s;s to obviate any objections which might be made to the hi&s;tory, that is given in the following pages, &s;hould it not be found exactly to corre&s;pond, with that which has been ob&s;erved by others, who have lived in the other i&s;lands of the We&s;t Indies, or in other parts of Jamaica; or perhaps even in the &s;ame part of Jamaica, at a different period of time. It is pre&s;umed, indeed, that the &s;ame fundamental di&s;tinctions of fever obtain in every i&s;land within the tropics; yet the de&s;cription that is given in this place, (it may not be unnece&s;&s;ary to mention), is affirmed to be &s;trictly exact, only in the di&s;trict about Savanna la Mar; and that only for a &s;hort &s;pace of time: <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> from the year 1774 to the year 1778.</P>
<P>The fever, that chiefly prevailed at Savanna la Mar during the period mentioned above, was u&s;ually mild in its &s;ymptoms, and more regularly remitting in its form than I under&s;tood the endemic di&s;ea&s;e to be in mo&s;t other parts of the i&s;land. To what cir|cum&s;tances in the local &s;ituation this might be owing, I do not pretend to determine. Savanna la Mar is &s;ituated clo&s;e by the &s;ea: its particular &s;cite, and the &s;urrounding country to the di&s;tance of &s;everal miles is perfectly level; whil&s;t in con&s;equence of its being open to the &s;ea on the ea&s;t, it is vi&s;ited early, and con|&s;tantly by a &s;alutary and refre&s;hing breeze. There
<PB N="3" REF="028890_0012_0FDE679C96984188">
is a &s;mall rivulet, indeed, which, lo&s;ing it&s;elf almo&s;t entirely in mud, forms a mora&s;s that partly &s;urrounds it on the north. From vicinity to this mora&s;s the &s;itua|tion of Savanna la Mar has been &s;u&s;pected to be un|healthy; but it is not &s;o in fact. The &s;ea at high wa|ter, particularly in the &s;pring tides, overflowing the &s;wampy ground, contributes in a great mea&s;ure, pre|haps, to dimini&s;h the more u&s;ual noxious qualities of the mar&s;h exhalation. The opinion of many eminent writers, however, is not altogether favourable to this idea; but there &s;eems to be rea&s;on to doubt, whether the opinion formed by tho&s;e writers in this in&s;tance, is the re&s;ult of accurate and careful ob&s;ervation; or if it is merely a &s;ugge&s;tion of theory. I am inclined to the latter way of thinking, as I have never found the neighbourhood of Salt-mar&s;hes, in the different parts of America that I have had the opportunity of vi&s;iting, le&s;s healthful than the re&s;t of the country:&mdash;on the contrary, they were frequently more &s;o.</P>
<P>Before proceeding to a particular de&s;cription of the fever, that chiefly prevailed in the di&s;trict of Savanna la Mar, it may not be &s;uperfluous to give the outline of its character, that we may be the better enabled to trace its re&s;emblance with the fevers of other climates, and to determine its place in the general cla&s;s of fe|brile di&s;ea&s;es. The common fever of Savanna la Mar, which, as I mentioned before, was u&s;ually mild in its &s;ymptoms, and regular in its form, &s;eems to be properly ranked with tho&s;e, that &s;trictly &s;peaking are called remitting. It is difficult to fix the boun|daries between remittents and intermittents, if a fixed boundary actually exi&s;ts. The paroxy&s;ms of the fever of Jamaica are ob&s;erved, in many in&s;tances, to termi|nate in more perfect remi&s;&s;ions than the paroxy&s;ms of the endemic of North America, which is known to be fundamentally an intermitting di&s;ea&s;e. Hence au|thors generally are of opinion, that all the difference which appears to take place in tho&s;e fevers, depends
<PB N="4" REF="028890_0013_0FDE679E0D3E6568">
merely on an accidental cau&s;e: <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> on the greater or le&s;s heat of the climate. I &s;hall not be po&s;itive that it is not &s;o; yet I cannot help remarking that certain appearances incline me to be of opinion, that there &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, between the endemic of Jamaica and the en|demic of North America, a difference, in &s;ome degree, fixed and e&s;&s;ential. I cannot pretend to a&s;certain the difference preci&s;ely; or to offer a conjecture about the modification of the morbid cau&s;e in which it con|&s;i&s;ts; yet the following circum&s;tances give rea&s;on to believe, that to a certain degree at lea&s;t it actually takes place. The common fever of Jamaica, for in|&s;tance, was not only di&s;po&s;ed to terminate of its own accord; but it was di&s;po&s;ed to terminate on certain critical days, often at an early period, and by &s;igns of cri&s;is too clear to be mi&s;taken; neither did the Peru|vian bark, in the manner at lea&s;t in which it was ma|naged, ever cut &s;hort its cour&s;e with certainty. The endemic of America on the contrary often la&s;ted long. It frequently, indeed, changed to another di&s;ea&s;e after a length of time; but no period could be a&s;&s;igned for its natural termination. The &s;igns of cri&s;is, it may likewi&s;e be remarked were &s;o ob&s;cure as &s;carcely to be di&s;tingui&s;hed with the clo&s;e&s;t attention; at lea&s;t for my own part I will own, that after an experience of &s;everal years, and the greate&s;t care in ob&s;erving the minute&s;t circum&s;tances, I never yet was able to &s;ay with confidence, that the endemic of America, parti|cularly in the northern provinces, was gone not to re|turn again, till the hour of its return was pa&s;t: nei|ther did the Peruvian bark, though its effects were &s;o equivocal in the fever of Jamaica, &s;carcely ever fail of &s;topping the progre&s;s of this di&s;ea&s;e. To which we may add, that the complaint, which &s;trictly &s;peaking is called the intermittent, or ague and fever, can &s;carcely be &s;aid to belong to Jamaica; at lea&s;t it was not known at Savanna la Mar. In the cour&s;e of four years I did not once ob&s;erve it; and tho&s;e, who had lived much longer at this place, a&s;&s;ured
<PB N="5" REF="028890_0014_0FDE67A70E5B52D0">
me they had never &s;een an in&s;tance of it; unle&s;s in per&s;ons who were newly arrived from agui&s;h coun|tries. This is a fact of &s;ome importance, as it &s;hews to us, that though the proper intermittent is not the endemic di&s;ea&s;e of the country it is &s;till capable of ex|i&s;ting in the climate:&mdash;no weak argument, that, the two di&s;ea&s;es of which we have been &s;peaking, actually do po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ome difference in the modification of the general cau&s;e, though we are unable to define the pre|ci&s;e bounds and limits of it.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tances which I have mentioned might incline us to be of opinion, that the fever of Jamaica, and the common endemic of America are not exactly the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e; that is, that though they depend on the &s;ame general cau&s;e; yet that this cau&s;e undergoes &s;ome fixed and permanent modification in tho&s;e different climates, &s;o that an e&s;&s;ential difference actually ari&s;es. But though this really appears to be the ca&s;e; yet I mu&s;t acknowledge, that the reigning epidemic of the &s;outhern provinces of America, often lo&s;es its di&s;tinc|tive marks of intermi&s;&s;ion in the hot months of &s;um|mer; whil&s;t it approaches, in other re&s;pects, &s;o near to the fever of Jamaica, as to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from it with difficulty. This was particularly the ca&s;e at Eben|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">er in Georgia, in the year 1779, during the months of June and July. A cold fit was &s;eldom ob&s;erved in this place; unle&s;s perhaps in the fir&s;t attack; lowne&s;s, languor, head-ach, pain of the back and other di&s;agree|able feelings remained even in the mo&s;t perfect remi&s;|&s;ions: the di&s;ea&s;e was likewi&s;e much di&s;po&s;ed to termi|nate of its own accord: on the u&s;ual critical days, fre|quently by &s;igns of cri&s;is, that were far from being ob&s;cure: yet though the&s;e re&s;emblances were &s;o very &s;triking, the fever of Ebenezer was perfectly under the controul of Peruvian bark, which was not exactly the ca&s;e with that of Jamaica. I mu&s;t remark, how|ever, that bark was u&s;ed with a freedom in America, that I never thought of attempting in the We&s;t Indies.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="028890_0015_0FDE67A846269D90">
But though it &s;till may be thought doubtful by &s;ome, whether the autumnal fever of agui&s;h countries, and the endemic fever of Jamaica are characteri&s;tically different, or e&s;&s;entially the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e; yet it is not &s;o difficult to trace a &s;pecific re&s;emblance, between this fever of the We&s;t Indies, and the prevailing en|demic of the AEgean Sea. The fever de&s;cribed in the Epidemics of Hippocrates has every &s;triking feature of the di&s;ea&s;e which is the &s;ubject of the following treati&s;e. The general character is the &s;ame; the cour&s;e and mode of termination are often alike. If the du|ration is &s;ometimes different, it is probably much ow|ing to the more deci&s;ive practice of the moderns: for though it remains uncertain, whether a remedy has yet been di&s;covered, which ab&s;olutely cuts &s;hort the fe|ver of Jamaica in the mid&s;t of its cour&s;e; yet no doubt remains, that there are various modes of treatment, which may, and actually do render the ordinary changes of the critical day, decidedly critical. The fevers of the AEgean Sea, as de&s;cribed by Hippocrates, and of Min<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ca, as de&s;cribed by the accurate Cleghorn, bear the neare&s;t re&s;emblance to the endemic of Sa|vanna la Mar. The fevers of Italy, of different parts of the continent of A&s;ia, as de&s;cribed by various wri|ters, as well as the fever of America, of which I have had per&s;onal experience, however ob&s;cure their remi&s;|&s;io<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;eem rather to be degenerated intermittents, than the di&s;ea&s;e de&s;cribed in the following pages. But that I may not be thought to in&s;i&s;t too much on this opinion, which few, perhaps, may con&s;ider as of much con&s;equence, I &s;hall relate the hi&s;tory of the fever of Savanna la Mar, as accurately as I can, leaving it to others to determine, whether it &s;hould be con&s;idered as an intermittent degenerated into a remitting form, in con&s;equence of the greater heat of the climate, or allowed to po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;omething characteri&s;tic in its own nature.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. OF THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF PERIODICAL FE|VERS.</HEAD>
<P>A Knowledge of the types and periods of fevers, though &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to be well under&s;tood by tho&s;e who pretend to cure the di&s;ea&s;e, has unfortu|nately been little attended to by the practitioners of Jamaica, In that country, I met with &s;ome who were able to foretel the returns of the &s;ingle tertian; but I met with none, and I have good rea&s;on to be|lieve that there actually were few, who troubled them|&s;elves about forms of greater complication. There were many, on the contrary, who, blinded by theories of accumulated bile, ridiculed altogether the idea of this &s;tated regularity in the movements of nature. To enter into a di&s;pute with &s;uch would be labour lo&s;t. The exi&s;tence of a regular type in the fevers of the We&s;t Indies does not admit of a doubt, yet we mu&s;t not forget to mention, that tho&s;e types are traced with greater difficulty in that country, where remi&s;&s;ions are ob&s;cure, than in others, where every paroxy&s;m is u&s;hered in by a cold fit. In Jamaica it is impo&s;&s;ible to follow them without the mo&s;t careful attention, or perhaps to attain a clear and &s;y&s;tematic knowledge of them, without writing down and analyzing many of tho&s;e ca&s;es which occur in practice. I remember to have been impre&s;&s;ed with the idea, at a very early pe|riod, that one ob&s;ervation made by my&s;elf would in reality be more u&s;eful than twenty equally important in them&s;elves, which I only retained in my memory from reading. Convinced of this truth I cea&s;ed to look for information in books, from the time that I arrived in the We&s;t Indies; but, tru&s;ting wholly to
<PB N="8" REF="028890_0017_0FDE67AB50405EB0">
my own experience, wrote down minutely, in the pre|&s;ence of the &s;ick, the hi&s;tory and cure of the mo&s;t im|portant ca&s;es of fever that occured to me. At &s;tated times I reviewed that which I had done, and arranged under proper heads the mo&s;t &s;triking circum&s;tances, that I found recorded in my notes. Among other un|expected appearances I ob&s;erved a regularity and order in the types of fevers, of which at fir&s;t I had no idea. But though the laws of nature appeared to be fixed and &s;table, in producing this varied but &s;tated regu|larity of form; yet a knowledge of tho&s;e laws was not ea&s;ily attained. Two years were &s;pent, and not fewer than a hundred ca&s;es were analyzed, before my views of the &s;ubject were in any degree accurate. The la|bour, perhaps, was &s;uperfluous; there being many au|thors who have de&s;cribed minutely every variety and every combination of type that has ever been ob&s;erved to take place. But as I had little knowledge of the writings of others at this period, I &s;hall content my|&s;elf in the fir&s;t place with relating the hi&s;tory of types as they occurred to my own ob&s;ervation; at the &s;ame time that I &s;hall not omit to take notice occa&s;ionally of the more con&s;tant peculiarities, which are found in authors of credit, who have practi&s;ed in different countries. The influence of climate I may ob&s;erve is of con&s;iderable effect in modifying the various forms.</P>
<P>The &s;ingle tertian, the period of which is forty-eight hours, is a form of fever that occurred frequently in Jamaica, particularly in the dry and healthy &s;ea&s;on. Its cour&s;e was ea&s;ily traced, as the remi&s;&s;ions were often di&s;tinct, and the acce&s;&s;ions &s;ometimes di&s;tingui&s;h|ed by a &s;light horror or &s;hivering.</P>
<P>But though the above-mentioned type was by no means of rare occurrence at Savanna la Mar; yet the double tertian, with &s;imilar paroxy&s;ms on alternate days, was &s;till more common, particularly in the rainy and &s;ickly months. This form of fever, which &s;eemed to con&s;i&s;t of two &s;ingle tertians, that ran a &s;eparate
<PB N="9" REF="028890_0018_0FDE67B4D587B800">
and independent cour&s;e, began u&s;ually in the morning. Its hour of inva&s;ion was from eight to ten; and its acce&s;&s;ion was generally di&s;tingui&s;hed by a cold fit. The paroxy&s;m, which for the mo&s;t part was regularly formed, declined after a continuance of eight or ten hours; and the patient remained free from fever, not only during the night, but during the following day, till four in the afternoon, or later. A feveri&s;h indi&s;|po&s;ition u&s;ually came on then, which continued the whole or the greate&s;t part of the night. A remi&s;&s;ion took place; but it was &s;oon &s;ucceeded by a paroxy&s;m &s;imilar in its &s;ymptoms, and manner of attack, to the paroxy&s;m of the fir&s;t day. This having declined to|wards evening, the patient, as formerly, was free from fever during the night and the day following. At the u&s;ual hour, however, or more generally before it, a paroxy&s;m more di&s;tinctly formed in all its parts, and more violent in degree, than the preceding one which corre&s;ponded with it, returned, and continued till morning. It &s;ub&s;ided; and was &s;oon &s;ucceeded by the paroxy&s;m of the fifth day, which declined, as formerly, after the u&s;ual duration. Such was the general cour&s;e and progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e.&mdash;The fever of the odd day, which began for the mo&s;t part in the morning, u&s;ually returned later and later, and with decrea&s;ing violence every &s;ucceeding paroxy&s;m; whil&s;t the fever of the even day, which generally began in the afternoon or evening, as u&s;ually returned earlier, and when this was the ca&s;e, frequently encrea&s;ed in force. The fe|ver which came on in the morning generally began the di&s;ea&s;e. It was for the mo&s;t part a fever of com|plete and regular paroxy&s;ms from the fir&s;t attack. The fever of the evening, on the contrary, was little more than an indi&s;po&s;ition in its beginning; nor was its time of appearing at all certain. It often was not perceived till the evening of the fourth day; &s;ome|times not till later, neither was its continuance of a fixed duration. Sometimes it went on after the fever

of the morning had cea&s;ed; and in other ca&s;es it ter|minated, while the other pur&s;ued an uninterrupted cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The type, which was &s;o frequent in Tha&s;us, and the other i&s;lands of the AEgean Sea, &s;eems to be a &s;pe|cies of the double tertian. Mention is made frequently of &s;uch a form in the Epidemics of Hippocrates; yet the double tertian of Hippocrates is directly oppo&s;ite, in &s;ome re&s;pects, to the type which I have ju&s;t now de&s;cribed.&mdash;The evening fever generally began the di&s;ea&s;e in tho&s;e i&s;lands: hence the great exacerbations, and con&s;equently the cri&s;is were frequently on the even days. Such al&s;o appears to have been &s;ome|times the ca&s;e in Minorca: yet Cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ghorn acknow|ledges, that a type, &s;imilar to that which I have de|&s;cribed as prevailing &s;o commonly at Savanna la Mar, was by much the mo&s;t frequent form of the above|mentioned i&s;land. It was al&s;o, I may add, frequent in the &s;outhern provinces of North America, particu|larly in the hot months of &s;ummer and autumn.</P>
<P>A quotidian type has been de&s;cribed by almo&s;t every author, who has written on the &s;ubject of intermitting and remitting fevers: neither can it be denied, that forms of di&s;ea&s;e frequently occur, where the paroxy&s;m returns every day at the &s;ame hour, with &s;ymptoms &s;o nearly alike, that an ordinary ob&s;erver can perceive no difference. Yet Mr. Senac, an author of con&s;i|derable eminence, boldly maintains, that a real quo|tidian type does not exi&s;t in nature. The que&s;tion, perhaps, is not ea&s;ily determined. I can only men|tion from my own experience, that I have frequently &s;een fevers with quotidian exacerbations of &s;uch a kind, that there was no perceivable difference between them, either in &s;ymptoms or in manner of attack; yet I mu&s;t likewi&s;e own, that the&s;e exacerbations were generally in the evenings; and that the di&s;ea&s;e was not in every re&s;pect of a di&s;tinct intermitting form.</P>
<P>I have now mentioned tho&s;e types that are mo&s;t
<PB N="11" REF="028890_0020_0FDE67B79AEF2C10">
frequently met with in the fevers of Jamaica; yet be|&s;ides the&s;e, there now and then occur others of more complicated and perplexing forms. Thus, I have &s;ometimes &s;een at Savanna la Mar, a fever, which &s;eemed to be compounded of a &s;ingle tertian with a quotidian. In the &s;pace of forty-eight hours there were three &s;eparate exacerbations, two of which were exactly alike, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to perceive a dif|ference; whil&s;t the whole three followed each other in &s;uch an order of time, that to a &s;uperficial ob&s;er|ver, there appeared to be only one long paroxy&s;m of thirty-&s;ix hours or more. An example will make it more plain. On Monday, for in&s;tance, the pa|roxy&s;m of a fever was ob&s;erved to begin about nine in the morning, preceded by &s;ome degree of coldne&s;s and &s;hivering. This paroxy&s;m was u&s;ually violent in its fir&s;t attack: But declined gradually towards evening; though before it was gone off totally, another exacerbation commenced, which continued the whole of the night. This likewi&s;e abated on Tue&s;day morning; and the patient remained ap|parently free from fever till five in the afternoon or later. A paroxy&s;m then made its appearance, &s;imilar to the paroxy&s;m of the preceding evening. It ran over a cour&s;e of &s;imilar duration, and &s;carcely had abated on Wedne&s;day morning, when a paroxy&s;m re|&s;embling that of Monday &s;ucceeded it; which, as for|merly, declining towards evening, was &s;oon followed by an exacerbation, that la&s;ted till the morning of Thur&s;day. On Thur&s;day, as on Tue&s;day, there was no fever till late in the afternoon; when the evening exacerbation returning at the u&s;ual hour, proceeded in its u&s;ual cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The tertian type, &s;imple, or variou&s;ly compounded, is the form of fever, which prevails mo&s;t univer&s;ally in all climates. The quartan in tho&s;e countries were I have lived was rare; and the exi&s;tence of a real quo|tidian, perhaps, is doubtful. To that compound form,
<PB N="12" REF="028890_0021_0FDE67B8C6077118">
which I have ju&s;t now de&s;cribed, I &s;hould be inclined to give the name of Semitertian. It is expre&s;sly the di&s;ea&s;e, which I now find has been de&s;cribed under this name by Hoffman; but it is more difficult to de|termine exactly, if it is the Hemitritaeus of the an|cients. The Hemitritaean form is frequently men|tioned by Hippocrates; but his definition is too lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e to enable us to judge preci&s;ely of its nature. It is in fact impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay with certainty, whether it is to a type &s;imilar to that which I have de&s;cribed, or to the extended and &s;ubintrant paroxy&s;ms of the double ter|tian, that he has applied the name. This la&s;t, indeed, &s;eems to have been the idea of many of the ancients, particularly of Cel&s;us and Agathinus.&mdash;The phy&s;i|cians of the earlier ages, were le&s;s curious in minute di&s;tinctions than their followers; and probably applied the name of Hemitritaeus to tho&s;e fevers, the pa|roxy&s;ms of which were &s;imply of unu&s;ual duration, no le&s;s than to tho&s;e that were of a complicated or com|pound nature. This actually appears to have been the ca&s;e for a great length of time; but at la&s;t, and not long indeed before the days of Galen, the &s;ophi&s;|tical genius of the profe&s;&s;ors of medicine, which exert|ed it&s;elf chiefly in things of little importance, mul|tiplied the types of fevers to an endle&s;s variety, and attempted to e&s;tabli&s;h di&s;tinctions which have no ex|i&s;tence in reality. Galen, who is copious in mo&s;t things, has di&s;cu&s;&s;ed very fully the &s;ubject of types in general, and de&s;cribed particularly the nature of the Semitertian at great length. But whatever credit may be otherwi&s;e due to the ob&s;ervations of this il|lu&s;trious writer, it is evident that the de&s;cription, in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, is merely the re&s;ult of theory. He has attempted, indeed, to illu&s;trate his opinion by an example; but the ca&s;e he has furni&s;hed us with, is con&s;tantly varying its hour of attack; and if ac|curately examined, appears rather to be a triple tertian, properly &s;o called, than the form of fever that
<PB N="13" REF="028890_0022_0FDE67C1DD83E498">
I have de&s;cribed above. After the Greeks we may next take a &s;hort view of the Arabian phy&s;icians, who, as they borrowed much of their knowledge from the writings of Galen, likewi&s;e adopted his idea of the compound nature of the Semitertian. Avicenna, the mo&s;t eminent among them, has defined this form of di&s;ea&s;e with a good deal of preci&s;ion; but we do not find that he has added any thing very material to the opi|nions of his predece&s;&s;ors. Galen indeed, had di&s;cu&s;|&s;ed the &s;ubject &s;o fully, that, though &s;ucceeding wri|ters &s;ometimes changed names, they do not &s;eem in reality to have furni&s;hed much new ob&s;ervation. As we de&s;cend to le&s;s remote times, Hoffman and Cleg|horn are the mo&s;t accurate of the moderns, on this &s;ubject, who have yet come to my hands. The for|mer de&s;cribes under the name of Semitertian the ex|pre&s;s form of di&s;ea&s;e, that I met with in Jamaica; the latter refers this title to the extended and &s;ubintrant paroxy&s;ms of the double tertian. It is with unwilling|ne&s;s that I differ in opinion from Cleghorn, who has thrown more light on the hi&s;tory of periodical fevers, than perhaps, all the writers of his time: yet I cannot help ob&s;erving, that I never recollect to have met with an original Semitertian, &s;uch as that he has de|&s;cribed in his well-known treati&s;e. I mu&s;t own, in|deed, that I have &s;everal times &s;een the morning fever of the double tertian anticipate, &s;o as to be mixed with the decline of the paroxy&s;m of the preceding evening; thereby producing a form of di&s;ea&s;e, that could only be di&s;tingui&s;hed, by the mo&s;t careful attention, from one long paroxy&s;m of thirty hours or more: yet this was in fact, only a degenerated double tertian, the paroxy&s;ms of which became accidentally mixed with each other.</P>
<P>The types which I have de&s;cribed above are all the varieties, that I ob&s;erved in the fevers of the We&s;t Indies; yet more exten&s;ive experience might have, perhaps, brought to my knowledge &s;till further com|plications:
<PB N="14" REF="028890_0023_0FDE67C28563A380">
for be&s;ides the forms mentioned in the pre|ceding pages, I had the opportunity, in the &s;outhern provinces of North America, to &s;ee &s;everal in&s;tances of the triple tertian, properly &s;o called. In forty-eight hours there were three &s;eparate paroxy&s;ms; all of them differing from each other, but corre&s;ponding with others that followed.&mdash;They were ea&s;ily traced, as the acce&s;&s;ions in that climate were u&s;ually di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by a cold fit. In Jamaica, on the contrary, complications and irregularities were marked with difficulty. The anticipation of type among other things occa&s;ioned con&s;iderable perplexity. Thus the &s;ingle tertian, who&s;e regular period is forty-eight hours, often completed its revolutions in forty-&s;ix. But though the paroxy&s;ms frequently returned one hour or even two hours &s;ooner than the u&s;ual time; yet the&s;e anticipations were &s;eldom longer, unle&s;s the di&s;ea&s;e was of a malignant nature, or di&s;po&s;ed to change to a continued form. In either of the&s;e ca&s;es anticipa|tions of twelve or fourteen hours were not uncom|mon. Of the different forms of fever the anticipa|tions of the &s;ingle tertian were the longe&s;t and mo&s;t remarkable. It was ob&s;erved, indeed, that the even|ing paroxy&s;m of the double tertian very generally re|turned before the u&s;ual hour; yet this return was &s;el|dom more than an hour at once; nor did the time of inva&s;ion in the whole cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, &s;o far as I have ob&s;erved, ever go beyond twelve at noon. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> morning paroxy&s;m, on the contrary, frequently po&s;t|poned; yet I have likewi&s;e ob&s;erved it &s;ometimes to anticipate &s;ix or eight hours at one time; by which means, it encroached on the paroxy&s;m of the preceding evening, and produced the di&s;ea&s;e which Cleghorn has di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Semitertian. The ob|&s;ervation of this fact does not &s;eem to have e&s;caped Avicenna.</P>
<P>There undoubtedly are accidental circum&s;tances, which have &s;ome effect in accelerating or retarding
<PB N="15" REF="028890_0024_0FDE67C404E981E0">
the return of the paroxy&s;m for a &s;hort &s;pace of time; yet it would appear, upon the whole, that the cau&s;e, why a fever anticipates or po&s;tpones, depends upon &s;omething that is peculiar to the particular nature of the di&s;ea&s;e. Thus, a fever, which once begins to an|ticipate, generally goes on anticipating through a great part of its cour&s;e; a certain proportion being frequently pre&s;erved between the anticipations of the different paroxy&s;ms. This was particularly the ca&s;e in the &s;ingle tertian of America. The paroxy&s;ms of the fevers of that country often anticipated to a cer|tain point, by &s;hort anticipations, which bore a re|gular proportion to each other; whil&s;t they were &s;ome|times likewi&s;e ob&s;erved to po&s;tpone, in the &s;ame gra|dual manner, towards the termination. This &s;eldom happened in the fevers of the We&s;t Indies.</P>
<P>The anticipations I have mentioned often occa&s;ion perplexity in tracing the types of fevers; yet the com|plications which ari&s;e in the progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e, have a &s;till more con&s;iderable effect in embarra&s;&s;ing the appearances of regularity. Fevers which begin as &s;ingle tertian, often continue &s;uch through the whole of their cour&s;e; yet it &s;ometimes likewi&s;e hap|pens, that complicating fevers make their appearance on the even days for in&s;tance, and continue longer, or terminate &s;ooner than the original complaint, in &s;uch manner, as if their exi&s;tence no way depended on it. To be able to di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e complications from the anticipations of a &s;ingle type is frequently very u&s;eful, and a knowledge of it may, in general, be attained with a good deal of certainty. Thus for in&s;tance, if the di&s;ea&s;e is moderate in its &s;ymptoms, and without &s;u&s;picion of malignity, the appearance of a paroxy&s;m twelve or fourteen hours before the u&s;ual time, e&s;pecially if there is no material difference in the nature of the &s;ymptoms, gives rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that the premature return is in reality the complication of another fever. On the contrary, where the di&s;ea&s;e
<PB N="16" REF="028890_0025_0FDE67C586D4AC28">
has betrayed &s;igns of malignity, or where the &s;ymp|toms differ from tho&s;e of the former paroxy&s;ms only in a greater degree of violence, there is then rea&s;on to apprehend that this appearance is only an anticipa|tion. On the &s;ubject of complication of type, &s;ome curious ob&s;ervations may be found in the writings of Galen and Avicenna. The opinions of tho&s;e au|thors, indeed, are often mixed with whim&s;ical theo|ries; yet in many re&s;pects they are fundamentally true and highly intere&s;ting.</P>
<P>It would be a matter of &s;ome utility could we learn to foretel, from the nature of the types, the accidents that are likely to happen in the progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e, or to form a probable conjecture of the event. Some|thing certainly may be gained if we ob&s;erve with at|tention. Thus I may remark, that I never found an|ticipations of one hour or even two to be of much con&s;equence in the fevers of Jamaica, particularly if they happened at an early period; yet if they were longer, or did not happen till after a long continu|ance of the di&s;ea&s;e, they often indicated an approach|ing cri&s;is. On the contrary, where the paroxy&s;m an|ticipated twelve or fourteen hours at one time, there was always &s;u&s;picion of danger, at whatever period this might happen. It either indicated danger and malignity, or a di&s;po&s;ition in the fever to change to a continued form. Anticipating fevers were likewi&s;e ob&s;erved to be more di&s;po&s;ed to terminate of them|&s;elves, and likewi&s;e to terminate more &s;peedily, than tho&s;e which &s;teadily pre&s;erved the &s;ame hour of re|turn. This &s;eems to have been known to the an|cients.&mdash;But farther, as anticipating types are gene|rally a &s;ign of increa&s;ing violence, though of a more &s;peedy termination; &s;o the po&s;tponing of the pa|roxy&s;m, has u&s;ually been allowed to indicate a di&s;ea&s;e, who&s;e violence has begun to decline. Such is the common ob&s;ervation; nor have I ever found it to be otherwi&s;e; unle&s;s in &s;ome ca&s;es of weakne&s;s and im|paired
<PB N="17" REF="028890_0026_0FDE67CEC00061A8">
&s;en&s;ibility, where the fatal paroxy&s;m did not come on till after the u&s;ual hour of attack.</P>
<P>I am afraid I may appear to many as unnece&s;&s;arily minute, on a &s;ubject, which is not in general con&s;i|dered as of much importance; yet &s;till I cannot for|bear to mention &s;ome circum&s;tances of connection, between the hour of inva&s;ion and the future type of the fever, which appear to be not only curious, but u&s;eful; and which, &s;o far as I know, have not been taken notice of by any preceding writer. Galen, it is true, boa&s;ts the knowledge of foretelling, from the appearance of the fir&s;t paroxy&s;m, the nature of the fu|ture type of the di&s;ea&s;e; yet the hour of inva&s;ion is not included among the number of tho&s;e &s;igns, from which he has drawn his information. The rules, in|deed, which he has left us are not altogether without foundation; yet they are by no means to be depended on alone. They have, in fact, ari&s;en from theories of bile and phlegm, rather than from accurate and careful ob&s;ervation. There is not, perhaps, any one crite|rion on this &s;ubjuct that applies equally in every cli|mate. Tho&s;e rules, which I thought I had di&s;co|vered, are only local. They varied in the different parts of Jamaica, and in mo&s;t parts of America did not apply in any degree. Having adopted, on my arrival in the We&s;t Indies, the method of writing down and analyzing &s;uch ca&s;es of fever as came un|der my care, the difference of hour, at which fevers of a different type u&s;ually commenced, &s;truck me as a matter of no &s;mall curio&s;ity. The &s;ingle tertian, for in&s;tance, was con&s;tantly remarked to begin in the forenoon, u&s;ually between the hours of eight and eleven; whil&s;t tho&s;e forms of di&s;ea&s;e, that were evi|dently quotidian, or &s;till more continued as con|&s;tantly began in the evening, generally from four to eight. This &s;eemed to be a fixed di&s;tinction; it is an important one; and &s;o far there was no ambiguity: but it was extremely difficult, perhaps impo&s;&s;ible, to
<PB N="18" REF="028890_0027_0FDE67D02C3736C0">
di&s;cover &s;igns at an early period, which were capable of di&s;tingui&s;hing the fever, which continued &s;imple in its form throughout, or which became complicated at a certain period of its cour&s;e. I have often made a fortunate conjecture; but I believe it would occa&s;ion embarra&s;&s;ment, rather than afford information, were I to attempt to de&s;cribe tho&s;e circum&s;tances, which &s;ometimes determined my opinion. They mu&s;t, in fact, be learnt from actual ob&s;ervation. I have ju&s;t now mentioned, that it is extremely difficult to di&s;tin|gui&s;h the &s;ingle from the double tertian, by the ap|pearances of the fir&s;t paroxy&s;m, when the morning fever of this la&s;t form begins the di&s;ea&s;e; &s;o neither is it ea&s;y to di&s;tingui&s;h the double tertian from the quo|tidian, when the illne&s;s commences with the evening paroxy&s;m of that complicated type. This is a ca&s;e, indeed, as far as my experience goes, rarely happens; yet where it does happen, the circum&s;tances, with which the evening fever is u&s;ually attended, mark a further di&s;tinction. The quotidian commences u&s;u|ally by a di&s;tinct and regular paroxy&s;m; the evening fever of the double tertian, for the mo&s;t part, only by a &s;light indi&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>This connexion which I have ju&s;t mentioned, be|tween the hour of inva&s;ion and the type of the fever, was ob&s;erved con&s;tantly at Savanna la Mar in Jamaica; but the &s;ame rules did not by any means hold true in the different parts of the continent of America. The mo&s;t u&s;ual hour of the inva&s;ion of the &s;ingle tertian was twelve at noon in that country; though in &s;ome ca&s;es the paroxy&s;m came on &s;o early as ten in the morning, or &s;o late as two in the afternoon. Of the other forms I cannot &s;peak with any certainty.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides the different hour of inva&s;ion of the different types, I mu&s;t likewi&s;e take notice of &s;ome other circum&s;tances, that &s;eemed to be connected with the various forms. The duration of the pa|roxy&s;m for in&s;tance, was u&s;ually longer in the &s;ingle tertian than in the double tertian, or quotidian; and
<PB N="19" REF="028890_0028_0FDE67D18C418ED8">
of the double tertian, the paroxy&s;m of the morning was u&s;ually longer than that of the evening; and be|&s;ides being longer, was generally of greater violence, at lea&s;t in the beginning of the di&s;ea&s;e. The cold fit was likewi&s;e more remarkable in the &s;ingle tertian, than in the other forms of fever.&mdash;I do not &s;peak of the quartan, of which I know but little. Of the bi|lious vomiting, &s;o much in&s;i&s;ted on by Galen as a di&s;tingui&s;hing mark of the &s;ingle tertian, I am at a lo&s;s to &s;peak po&s;itively. I can, indeed, affirm that I con&s;tantly ob&s;erved &s;uch evacuations to be more fre|quent in the different forms of the tertian, than in tho&s;e that appeared to be quotidian, or that approached nearer to a continued type.</P>
<P>Such were the types of the fever of Jamaica, and &s;uch were the principal circum&s;tances that appeared to be connected with them. The types of fevers it may be ob&s;erved &s;eem to be modified by climate; and there are not perhaps two different countries, or even di&s;tricts of country, in which they are exactly alike. The hour of inva&s;ion of the &s;ame form of di&s;ea&s;e was different in Jamaica, and on the continent of North America; neither does it appear to have been exactly the &s;ame in Jamaica, and in the different i&s;lands of the Mediterranean. The prevalence of certain forms in certain climates, and the various changes of the form according to the changes of the &s;ea&s;on, is a mat|ter of curio&s;ity, and of con&s;iderable importance in the hi&s;tory of the di&s;ea&s;e. In Jamaica for in&s;tance, for one &s;ingle tertian, there were at lea&s;t three double ones; whil&s;t in America, the &s;ingle tertian bore the proportion of ten to one, perhaps, to all the other forms. In the higher latitudes of this country, the &s;ingle tertian was almo&s;t the only form which was &s;een, in the winter months and in &s;pring; yet in the &s;outhern provinces, particularly in the heat of &s;um|mer and &s;ometimes in autumn, the double tertian, and even &s;till more complicated types were by no means uncommon.</P>

I have thus endeavoured in the preceding pages to de&s;cribe the types of remitting fevers, as they oc|cured to my own ob&s;ervation. I have likewi&s;e at|tempted to compare my own de&s;criptions with tho&s;e of other authors; &s;o that the reader may, in &s;ome de|gree, be able to attain a &s;y&s;tematic view of this &s;pe|cies of di&s;ea&s;e, as it appears in the different parts of the world. The labour I am aware will be reckoned &s;uperfluous by many; and a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion on types, will probably be con&s;idered as partaking too much of the &s;chool of Galen, who is held in contempt by the wri|ters of the pre&s;ent day. I by no means contend for the infallibility of Galen or the ancients; yet I can|not help believing, that though they have left us much fal&s;e and &s;uperfluous theory, they have likewi&s;e left us many valuable ob&s;ervations, on the nature and progre&s;s of febrile di&s;ea&s;es, which the moderns &s;eem to have neglected. Though the theory of Galen on the pre&s;ent &s;ubject is probably ill founded, his ob&s;erva|tions are certainly exact; and from what I have my|&s;elf &s;een, no a&s;&s;ertions, which will convince me, that an intimate acqaintance with the types and periods of fevers, is not an e&s;&s;ential knowledge to the practi|tioner. It is, indeed, the fir&s;t &s;tep; and it is a &s;tep of &s;uch importance, that our future progre&s;s will neither be &s;atisfactory nor &s;afe, unle&s;s it is properly under|&s;tood. I may be allowed to &s;peak from my own ex|perience. It fell to my lot to have the charge of men's lives at an early period of life. I had then no know|ledge of the types and periods of febrile di&s;ea&s;es, and I mu&s;t not conceal, that the method of treatment I pur&s;ued, and the returns of the di&s;ea&s;e &s;o often inter|fered, that though actual harm was &s;eldom done, yet many opportunities of doing good were certainly lo&s;t. The patient, if he had the lea&s;t penetration, could not, &s;ometimes, avoid &s;eeing, that, though I might be ac|quainted with the common routine of practice, I was ignorant of the nature and progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e, from which I had undertaken to relieve him.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. CRITICAL DAYS IN FEVERS.</HEAD>
<P>THE critical days, which are intimately connect|ed with the types and periods of fevers, come properly to be con&s;idered in this place. The &s;ubject is important, and though very fully di&s;cu&s;&s;ed by me|dical writers, does not as yet appear to have been &s;a|tisfactorily explained by any one. If we attempt to trace the doctrine to its &s;ource, we &s;hall find the fir&s;t mention of it in the writings of Hippocrates. The followers of this author's opinions are numerous; and the endeavours, they have employed in attempt|ing to e&s;tabli&s;h his &s;y&s;tem, have been &s;trenuous and unremitting. But critical days have unfortunately afforded a field for controver&s;y in all ages; and there &s;till are many who maintain, and others who as con|finently deny the exi&s;tence of any &s;uch power in af|fecting the termination of febrile di&s;ea&s;es. In the mid&s;t of this perplexity, a man who has had no expe|rience of his own is totally at a lo&s;s, which way to turn. There are great names on both &s;ides of the que&s;tion, but clear and deci&s;ive evidence on neither. A detail, therefore, of &s;uch ob&s;ervations as promi&s;e to remove many of tho&s;e circum&s;tances of embarra&s;&s;|ment, cannot fail of being u&s;eful, and I hope accept|able to the public. I am aware, indeed, that an at|tempt to explain a my&s;tery, which has hitherto eluded the re&s;earches of the mo&s;t eminent phy&s;icians, will not probably e&s;cape cen&s;ure:&mdash;In an ob&s;cure man, per|haps, it may be deemed arrogant; neither is it alto|gether without he&s;itation that I undertake the di&s;cu&s;|&s;ion; though very unequivocal proofs of the truth of the principles on which I proceed, ari&s;e from a view
<PB N="22" REF="028890_0031_0FDE67DD42A4F4C8">
of the ca&s;es of fever which came under my care, dur|ing the time I lived in the We&s;t Indies. The prin|ciple on which the critical days in that climate depend, appears from the facts found in the following pages to be indi&s;putably e&s;tabli&s;hed; the deviations are &s;a|tisfactorily accounted for; and the fundamental rules, it is pre&s;umed, are &s;uch as may be extended to every climate on the globe. But, I &s;hall &s;tate in a few words the leading circum&s;tances, which occurred to me on the &s;ubject. If they afford not light enough to remove all the difficulties, it is hoped they may at lea&s;t point out a road, by which the&s;e difficulties may in future be removed.</P>
<P>It may not be improper to remark in the fir&s;t place, that I had heard of the doctrine of critical days in fe|vers before my arrival in the We&s;t Indies; yet I may likewi&s;e ob&s;erve, that it was a doctrine, which I had only heard of by name. I had no knowledge of it, and I &s;oon found that the idea was treated with ridi|cule by practitioners, who very generally &s;uppo&s;ed the cour&s;e of the fevers of Jamaica to be cut &s;hort by bark, or other powerful means. Influenced, perhaps, by the authority of older men, I found my&s;elf di&s;po&s;ed to acquie&s;ce in the common opinion, that this doctrine was only one of the fanciful theories of the &s;chools; yet it was not long before I acquired a different view of the &s;ubject. I &s;oon ob&s;erved that fevers &s;ometimes cea&s;ed before a &s;ingle grain of bark was given; &s;ometimes after a few do&s;es, and &s;ometimes not till after &s;everal ounces. The ob&s;ervation of this fact did not fail to undeceive me. Under the circum|&s;tances I mention, it would have been the height of ob&s;tinacy to have per&s;i&s;ted in believing, that the cure of the fever was in reality owing to the power of this celebrated remedy. But though it was &s;oon evident, that the termination of the di&s;ea&s;e depended on &s;ome other thing than that which was generally &s;uppo&s;ed; yet a con&s;iderable time pa&s;t over, before I was able to determine what this &s;omething actually
<PB N="23" REF="028890_0032_0FDE67DE460A3420">
was, or before I was able to a&s;certain the laws which it obeyed. I &s;oon di&s;covered, indeed, that fevers had a general tendency to terminate on particular days; but it was not till the year 1776, that I di&s;covered the proportion tho&s;e days bore to each other, or the &s;ources of the many deviations, which occurred. The &s;ubject &s;eemed to be important;&mdash;and I felt an eagerne&s;s to determine a que&s;tion, which hitherto had been fruit|le&s;sly pur&s;ued. With this view I wrote down with care and attention every ca&s;e of fever which I met with in the year 1776 and 1777; and in looking over the memoranda &s;ometime after, found, that the critical days bore to each other the following proportion: <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> of &s;ixty ca&s;es, which terminated favourably, ten ter|minated on the third, ten on the fifth, twenty on the &s;eventh, ten on the ninth, five on the eleventh, three on the thirteenth, and two on the &s;eventeenth. Of nine which terminated fatally, one terminated on the &s;ixth, one on the &s;eventh, &s;ix on the eighth, and one on the tenth. The&s;e facts are preci&s;e and determi|nate; but I mu&s;t not forget to mention, that if we are guided wholly by obvious appearances, there &s;ome|times occur circum&s;tances, which occa&s;ion embarra&s;&s;|ment. Thus in the pre&s;ent in&s;tances, I not only rec|koned the time by the periods, or revolutions of the di&s;ea&s;e, but I likewi&s;e &s;implified the complicated types; that is, I reckoned every revolution of the &s;ingle ter|tian as forty-eight hours, though it was often com|pleated in le&s;s; whil&s;t I con&s;idered the corre&s;ponding paroxy&s;ms of the double tertian, only as the &s;ame di&s;|ea&s;e. It may al&s;o be farther remarked, that the di&s;ea&s;e, which was the &s;ubject of this inve&s;tigation, was of a regular, remitting form. Paroxy&s;ms and remi&s;&s;ions were always di&s;cernible, and &s;igns of cri&s;is were ge|nerally di&s;tinct.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of the critical days, as repre&s;ented above is literally exact, where the complicated types were &s;implified, and where the time was reckoned by the pe|riods of the di&s;ea&s;e; but I mu&s;t likewi&s;e ob&s;erve, that
<PB N="24" REF="028890_0033_0FDE67DFC6B721A8">
unle&s;s this method of calculation was adopted, there oc|cured numerous in&s;tances, which &s;eemed to deviate from the general rule. In the fir&s;t place, if the type of the fever was &s;ingle tertian, which neither anticipated nor po&s;tponed,&mdash;and with paroxy&s;ms which did not exceed twelve hours in duration, the cri&s;is was uni|formly on an odd day: yet if the type anticipated, and the &s;um of the anticipations, in the cour&s;e of the di&s;|ea&s;e, was equal to twenty-four hours, the cri&s;is was then nece&s;&s;arily removed t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">an even day, if the time was reckoned by the natural day; though &s;till on an odd day, if reckoned in the manner which has been men|tioned above. In like manner, if the type po&s;tponed, while the duration of the paroxy&s;m exceeded or amounted to 24 hours, the cri&s;is was nece&s;&s;arily protracted to an even day. But this was a ca&s;e, which &s;eldom happened. In fevers likewi&s;e of the double tertian type, the type which prevailed principally at Savanna la Mar, there occurred much &s;eeming irre|gularity. This form of fever, as was &s;aid before, &s;eemed to con&s;i&s;t of two di&s;ea&s;es, which ran a &s;eparate and independent cour&s;e. Thus, if the fever which began on the odd day was critical; that is, if the pa|roxy&s;m of the odd day terminated the di&s;ea&s;e, the cri|&s;is was nece&s;&s;arily on an odd day; but if that fever, the fir&s;t attack of which was on the even day, con&s;i&s;ted of an equal number of paroxy&s;ms with the other, or continued after that had cea&s;ed, the cri&s;is was then on an even day, reckoning from the beginning of the ill|ne&s;s, though &s;till on an odd day, dating from the commencement of the &s;econd fever. It was the ob|&s;ervation of this fact which fir&s;t gave me the idea of &s;implifying complicated types, and of calculating the critical days by the periods of the di&s;ea&s;e. The idea may perhaps be reckoned fanciful; but experience has afforded me &s;ufficient proofs, and it will &s;till af|ford the &s;ame to tho&s;e who take the trouble to look for them, that the various types of complicated fevers
<PB N="25" REF="028890_0034_0FDE67E8B5A23598">
actually run a &s;eparate and independent cour&s;e; a fact when e&s;tabli&s;hed, which removes all doubt and am|biguity from the apparently varying laws of critical days in the compound forms of febrile di&s;ea&s;es. With regard to the quotidian it remains to be remarked, that the cri&s;is was generally on an odd day. It was likewi&s;e generally on an odd day in tho&s;e that were &s;till more continued and acute;&mdash;a fact which &s;eems to have been well known to Avicenna. But though the rules I have mentioned are clear and uniform, I mu&s;t &s;till own, that I have &s;ometimes met with fevers of a very continued kind, which terminated late on the &s;ixth, or rather very early on the &s;eventh. The di&s;ea&s;e was then of more than u&s;ual violence on the &s;ixth:&mdash;how far this might be owing to anticipations of the paroxy&s;m of the &s;eventh, accumulated upon that of the &s;ixth, is difficult to determine with certainty.</P>
<P>The anticipation, the po&s;tponing, and the compli|cation of type are the principal circum&s;tances, which u&s;ually di&s;turb the regular critical periods in fevers of &s;hort duration; yet in tho&s;e of longer continuance, there is &s;till another cau&s;e, which de&s;erves to be par|ticularly attended to. In the fevers of Jamaica, e&s;pe|cially in tho&s;e which approached to a continued form, &s;ome very apparent change in the nature of the &s;ymp|toms, or in the mode of action of the febrile cau&s;e, was generally ob&s;erved on the &s;eventh, or before it. In con&s;equence of this change, the order of the cri|tical days was &s;ometimes di&s;turbed, and appearances were often produced, which &s;eemed to contradict the rules, which we have attempted to e&s;tabli&s;h. It was a common remark, that after the &s;eventh there was le&s;s apparent regularity in the movements of nature, This, as we &s;hall afterwards attempt to prove, was the con&s;equence of a &s;eptenary revolution, which accidentally di&s;turbed the regular order of the ordi|nary days of cri&s;is. It is a fact of which the ancients were not ignorant; and of which I &s;hall have occa|&s;ion
<PB N="26" REF="028890_0035_0FDE67E987273128">
to make frequent u&s;e: <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that a relap&s;e has a tendency to run over a cour&s;e of duration equal to the original fever. This is confirmed by the autho|rity of Hippocrates; but I may al&s;o add, that not only tho&s;e recurrences of fever, which are more pro|perly &s;tyled relap&s;es; but further, that in tho&s;e in|&s;tances, where the di&s;ea&s;e undergoes any remarkable change in the nature of its &s;ymptoms, the di&s;order is generally di&s;po&s;ed to continue for the &s;ame length of time in this new form, as it had done in the former. Thus a remarkable change of &s;ymptoms on the fifth was followed by a cri&s;is on the ninth; &s;ometimes, perhaps, only by another change of &s;ymptoms on the ninth, the final cri&s;is not happening till after another period of five days. In like manner, a change of &s;ymptoms on the &s;eventh was often followed by a cri&s;is on the thirteenth; or only, perhaps, by another change on the thirteenth, the di&s;ea&s;e completing ano|ther revolution of &s;even days before a final termina|tion. That &s;uch changes actually do take place at certain periods, not only tho&s;e ca&s;es of fever, which have come under my own care, but tho&s;e related by Hippocrates, in the books of Epidemics, give &s;uffi|cient room to believe. Thus in every one of tho&s;e in&s;tances, where the hi&s;tory is &s;o circum&s;tantially de|tailed as to leave it in our power to trace the di&s;ea&s;e in its progre&s;s, it will con&s;tantly be found, if the day of cri&s;is deviates from the general rule, that a change of &s;ymptoms, often an evident renewal of fever, had actually taken place at &s;ome period of the cour&s;e. In this manner, if the change of &s;ymptoms of which I &s;peak happened on an odd day, the odd days continued to be critical, as if no change had been; on the con|trary, if the paroxy&s;m of the odd day completed its cour&s;e, the remi&s;&s;ion which followed was often more perfect than u&s;ual:&mdash;a di&s;tinct period was marked in the hi&s;tory of the di&s;ea&s;e,&mdash;or in other words, there was an ob&s;cure or imperfect cri&s;is. But on the
<PB N="27" REF="028890_0036_0FDE67EB055007F8">
day following, which was an even day, a fever with a different train of &s;ymptoms made its appearance, and ran over a cour&s;e, for the mo&s;t part, equal in dura|tion to the former. If this change, or renewal of the di&s;ea&s;e happened on the &s;ixth, a change or cri&s;is was not expected till the tenth, if on the eighth, not till the fourteenth. I have &s;aid ju&s;t now, that relap&s;es were generally di&s;po&s;ed to run over a cour&s;e of the &s;ame duration as the original di&s;ea&s;e; yet I mu&s;t like|wi&s;e remark, that they were &s;ometimes al&s;o of &s;horter continuance. Thus I have frequently ob&s;erved a change of the nature of the &s;ymptoms on the &s;eventh, and a final cri&s;is on the eleventh; the renewal of the di&s;ea&s;e, in&s;tead of &s;even, being only of five days con|tinuance.</P>
<P>The above circum&s;tances are capable of explain|ing the ordinary deviations from the regular critical periods in the fevers of the We&s;t-Indies; but I can|not affirm with the &s;ame certainty, that a &s;imilar ex|planation will be con&s;tantly admitted in the long fevers of this country. I have however rea&s;on to believe, that changes at the &s;eptenary periods fre|quently take place here, and &s;ometimes apparently di&s;turb the critical periods of the di&s;ea&s;e. Tho&s;e ca&s;es which I have been able to trace with accuracy give &s;trong proofs of it,&mdash;I &s;hall relate two or three of them to &s;erve as an illu&s;tration. The fir&s;t, is that of a young man, who had been il<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of a fever more than three weeks before I was called to him. Two days before I &s;aw him; and after an evident abate|ment of the &s;ymptoms, there happened a &s;udden and unexpected relap&s;e, or renewal of the di&s;ea&s;e. In|formed of this circum&s;tance, I dated from the new attack, and calculated the critical days in the manner which has been &s;hewn above. Minute attention di&s;|covered the type, though it was only an ob&s;cure one.&mdash;It was Semitertian, or there was an exacer|bation every evening, with a more evident paroxy&s;m
<PB N="28" REF="028890_0037_0FDE67EC86428A00">
on the alternate days. A cri&s;is happened at the period I had fore&s;een, but it was not final. A fever returned again in the evening, different however in type, as well as in &s;ymptoms, from the preceding. It had di&s;tinct quotidian exacerbations and an imperfect cri&s;is happened on the &s;eventh. But in twelve or fourteen hours, a coldne&s;s and &s;hivering marked a renewal of the old, or perhaps the inva&s;ion of a new di&s;ea&s;e. The &s;ymptoms were not only different in their nature from the &s;ymptoms of the former; but they were likewi&s;e more violent in degree. The di&s;ea&s;e continued in this form for &s;even days, and the cri&s;is, which at la&s;t was only imperfect, was &s;oon &s;ucceeded by another renewal of fever, the beginning of which was marked by a &s;imilar degree of coldne&s;s and &s;hivering. The &s;ymptoms of this were likewi&s;e different from the pre|ceding, but its form was the &s;ame, and it ran over a cour&s;e of equal duration. The &s;eptenary revolutions were very plain in this ca&s;e. I &s;hall relate another in which they were not &s;o clearly marked, though they certainly did &s;till take place. It is a ca&s;e of fever with nervous &s;ymptoms. On the &s;eventh a &s;ediment ap|peared in the urine, &s;ome drops of blood fell from the no&s;e; and the abatement of fever was very evident; yet it did not la&s;t long. The di&s;ea&s;e recurred again on the eighth, and continued to increa&s;e in violence till the fourteenth. A &s;ediment then appeared in the urine, &s;ome drops of blood fell from the no&s;e as be|fore, there were two or three evacuations by &s;tool, which had been unu&s;ual in the preceding cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e; and from the whole appearances I could not help entertaining &s;ome &s;aint hopes of cri&s;is. There was indeed an evident alleviation of the &s;ufferings; but it la&s;ted but for a &s;hort time. Next day every &s;ymptom was aggravated, and the powers of life &s;eem|ed to &s;uffer a gradual diminution till the twentieth, when the patient died. I do not recollect any in|&s;tance of fever, where the revolutions were more ob|&s;cure
<PB N="29" REF="028890_0038_0FDE67F41BE4F9D8">
than in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e; yet they were &s;till ca|pable of being traced. The next example I &s;hall mention is much clearer. It is an in&s;tance of a bad fever, of no di&s;cernible type in the beginning, in a man who was con&s;iderably advanced in years. On the evening of the &s;eventh there was &s;ome ob&s;cure tendency to cri&s;is. The patient was not only ea&s;ier in his own feelings; but the eye and countenance, which had been confu&s;ed and clouded, brightened up, and a &s;mall &s;ediment appeared in the urine. Yet the&s;e favourable circum&s;tances were only of &s;hort duration. In the cour&s;e of the day following, all the &s;ymptoms recurred, and the di&s;ea&s;e acquired force till the evening of the thirteenth. The pul&s;e then began to ri&s;e, and continued ri&s;ing till the morning of the fourteenth, when a profu&s;e &s;weat was followed by a very di&s;tinct cri&s;is. But &s;till this cri&s;is was not final. The malignity of the di&s;ea&s;e, however, departed, and the complaint that remained, a&s;&s;uming a remitting form, totally di&s;appeared after another pe|riod of &s;even days. I &s;hall only beg leave to relate another in&s;tance of fever, which occured to me lately, and which affords a very curious proof of &s;eptenary revolutions in febrile di&s;ea&s;es of long continuance. A young man had been ill of a fever about a fort|night before I was called to him. At the time I fir&s;t &s;aw him, the &s;ymptoms were very violent; but having abated con&s;iderably in the cour&s;e of a day or two, I began to entertain hopes of a &s;peedy recovery. The complaint was almo&s;t entirely gone, when a new train of &s;ymptoms unexpectedly making its appearance, raged with violence for a day or two, and then de|clined gradually as the other had done. I again look|ed for &s;igns of cri&s;is, when another acce&s;&s;ion on the &s;eventh from the former attack, brought matters into &s;till greater danger. The&s;e &s;ymptoms, though of a different nature from the former, were violent in the beginning; but they &s;oon began to abate, and had
<PB N="30" REF="028890_0039_0FDE67F5EF317B60">
almo&s;t di&s;appeared, when the attack was once more renewed on the following &s;eventh. In this manner the di&s;ea&s;e went through nine &s;eptenary revolutions; and it is &s;omewhat remarkable, that the &s;ymptoms, which marked the new acce&s;&s;ion, were always diffe|rent from tho&s;e of the acce&s;&s;ion immediately preced|ing. In one, the di&s;tingui&s;hing &s;ymptoms were a moro&s;e and &s;tern &s;ullenne&s;s, in another, delirium, tre|mors and &s;ub&s;ultus tendinum,&mdash;and in the third, co|pious liver-coloured &s;tools. The&s;e were three times &s;everally repeated. It de&s;erves, however, to be re|marked, that the period of the acce&s;&s;ions was &s;hort|ened before the termination of the di&s;ea&s;e. After it had continued nine weeks in the manner I have de&s;|cribed above, there were two acce&s;&s;ions of five days each; after which all traces of fever di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>It is &s;ufficiently plain from the facts which I have mentioned in the preceding pages, that the more u&s;ual irregularities in the order of the critical days, proceed generally from overlooking the type in periodical fevers, or from neglecting to attend to &s;eptenary, and other revolutions, in &s;uch as approach more nearly to a continued form. The&s;e are the general cau&s;es of apparent irregularity; yet be&s;ides the&s;e, there are &s;till &s;ome others, which mu&s;t not be pa&s;&s;ed over with|out notice, as they occa&s;ionally have the effect of producing apparent deviations. Thus it often hap|pens, that a di&s;ea&s;e, which appears to be continued in the beginning, changes to remitting after a certain duration. The change is u&s;ually on an odd day, and on the day following the fir&s;t paroxy&s;m of the remit|ting form makes its appearance, the termination of which may be expected on an even day, if we date from the beginning of the illne&s;s, though &s;till on an odd day, if we date, (as perhaps we ought to do) from the time this change in the circum&s;tances of the di&s;ea&s;e took place. To this we may add, that tho&s;e complicating fevers, which, happening at various di&s;|tances
<PB N="31" REF="028890_0040_0FDE67F74F07F620">
of time, &s;ometimes terminate &s;ooner, &s;ome|times continue longer than the original complaint, frequently di&s;turb in appearance the general regu|larity of the critical periods of nature. It happens, perhaps, from a &s;imilar cau&s;e, that a paroxy&s;m of an unu&s;ual kind &s;ometimes terminates the di&s;ea&s;e, and apparently di&s;turbs the regular periods of cri&s;is This has occurred to me &s;everal times in practice; and it happened twice in my own per&s;on. The ordinary paroxy&s;m declined after the u&s;ual duration; a new one &s;ucceeded of uncommon violence, and very dif|ferent in its nature from the former. Its cour&s;e was of long continuance, and it finally terminated the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The above facts enable us to explain &s;atisfactorily every circum&s;tance, which relates to critical days in fevers, where the cri&s;is is clear and decided; yet I mu&s;t &s;till own, that as I have &s;ometimes met with fevers where marks of cri&s;is were &s;carcely perceptible &s;o it would be ra&s;hne&s;s, in &s;uch ca&s;es, to &s;peak po&s;i|tively of the order of the critical days. The patient might, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, be &s;aid to wade through the di&s;ea&s;e; the changes from day to day being &s;o very &s;mall, that it required more di&s;cernment than I can boa&s;t of to mark them with preci&s;ion.</P>
<P>The ob&s;ervations I have related, and the rules I have attempted to e&s;tabli&s;h, for the better explana|tion of the doctrine of critical days in fevers, were formed at a time when I had no knowledge of the opinions of preceding authors. They may therefore better claim exemption from bias in favour of one &s;et of writers, or prejudice again&s;t another. They are indeed no more than an analy&s;is of facts, which were collected with every po&s;&s;ible care, which are &s;ufficiently circum&s;tantial, and which &s;peak be&s;t for them&s;elves. They contain, (if I do not view them with a partial eye,) &s;uch information, as may lead to a &s;atisfactory explanation of this my&s;terious and long
<PB N="32" REF="028890_0041_0FDE67F8843AEE78">
di&s;puted doctrine.&mdash;I mu&s;t only beg leave to add, that though I have everywhere mentioned the pre|eminence of particular days in terminating fevers, yet it mu&s;t not be under&s;tood, that this power de|pends on a particular quality of the days, merely as &s;uch. It depends more evidently on a certain number of revolutions of the di&s;ea&s;e, in con&s;equence of which, the fever from &s;omething we do not in the lea&s;t un|der&s;tand, &s;eems di&s;po&s;ed to terminate finally, or to &s;uffer a change in its mode of action. This there|fore brings us to the conclu&s;ion, that the critical pe|riods are improper calculated by the natural day. The doctrine, in &s;hort, can only be rendered con&s;i&s;t|ent by attending to the periods of the di&s;ea&s;e, by &s;im|plifying complicated types, and by marking tho&s;e &s;eptenary or other revolutions, which happening at different di&s;tances of time, occa&s;ion an appearance of irregularity which does not exi&s;t in reality.</P>
<P>Having related the re&s;ult of my own ob&s;ervations on critical days in fevers, I &s;hall now endeavour to bring under one point of view, the &s;ub&s;tance of what has been written on the &s;ubject, by &s;ome of the mo&s;t celebrated of the ancient, as well as modern phy&s;icians. That certain days, or that portions of time compre|hended in a certain number of days, had obviou&s;ly a power of producing changes on the human frame, ap|pears to be an ob&s;ervation of high antiquity; but as a medical doctrine, we are unable to trace it farther than the days of Hippocrates. Hippocrates has treated very fully of the critical periods of fevers, in various parts of his works; and upon the whole, has ama&s;&s;ed a con|&s;iderable body of information; though with le&s;s pre|ci&s;ion, perhaps, than has been generally imagined. The ca&s;es of the Epidemics, which we naturally con|&s;ider as the materials from which he formed his gene|ral doctrine, have &s;ome obvious and great defects. The date is &s;eldom clearly a&s;certained, and the mode of calculating the time, does not &s;eem to be fixed. If
<PB N="33" REF="028890_0042_0FDD22D429FBB228">
a fever, for in&s;tance, begins in the evening, or in the cour&s;e of the night, the day following is generally reckoned the fir&s;t day of the di&s;ea&s;e, by this author.&mdash;But this is not all.&mdash;Some of the ca&s;es are plainly re|lated from memory; and others are only parts of ca&s;es, related by different per&s;ons. This want of accuracy, where it is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to be too cir|cum&s;tantial, nece&s;&s;arily breeds confu&s;ion, and pro|duces an appearance of irregularity, which does not actually exi&s;t. Hence we find incon&s;i&s;tency in the general doctrine, as delivered in different parts of the works, which have been a&s;cribed to Hippocrates; at the &s;ame time, that there is a want of that circum&s;tantial detail in the particular parts, from which only we can be enabled to form an opinion. I have read over with much attention the ca&s;es of fevers, recorded in the Epidemics; but I frequently found my&s;elf unable to trace the di&s;ea&s;e in its progre&s;s. Though evidently &s;ubject to periodical movements, it was not always in my power to lay hold of the type; yet wherever it was po&s;&s;ible to attain this exactne&s;s, I have the &s;atisfaction to add, that I con&s;tantly found the move|ments of nature to be uniform. They were the &s;ame in the i&s;lands of the Archipelago, as in the i&s;land of Jamaica.&mdash;If they appeared in &s;ome in&s;tances to be different, it was perhaps principally owing to this, that the Greek phy&s;ician had left &s;ome part of the di&s;|ea&s;e unde&s;cribed.</P>
<P>From what I have ju&s;t now &s;aid, we can have no he&s;itation in concluding, that the opinion of Hippo|crates, on the &s;ubject of critical days, is neither pre|ci&s;e in any one part, nor con&s;i&s;tent in the whole. The doctrine, however, in its be&s;t dige&s;ted form, is the following: <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> That odd days have a remarkable power in terminating fevers; but more particularly, that the great critical revolutions happen at quater|nary periods. Thus the mo&s;t eminent critical days, are the fourth, the &s;eventh, the eleventh, the four|teenth,
<PB N="34" REF="028890_0043_0FDE6800C7745340">
the &s;eventeenth and the twentieth. This is the general form of this Hippocratic doctrine; yet in this form, it bears contradiction to ob&s;ervations that are found in various parts of that ancient author's works. The fifth and ninth are excluded by this arrangement, from the number of the critical days; though there are numerous examples of their great power, in terminating febrile di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>The doctrine of critical days, which appeared fir&s;t in a regular form, in the writings of Hippocrates, found numerous and re&s;pectable advocates among the ancient phy&s;icians. Diocles of Cary&s;tus, Philotimus, Heraclides of Tarentum, &amp;c. all bore te&s;timony to the general truth of the ob&s;ervation; but their writ|ings being unfortunately lo&s;t, we are now ignorant of the particular facts and arguments, by which they attempted to &s;upport their opinions. Indeed, from the time of the Per&s;ian inva&s;ion of Greece, till the Roman arms penetrated into Afia, a period of near four hundred years, we know of no oppo&s;ition to to this fundamental doctrine of the Coan Sage: But in the time of Pompey the Great, an author aro&s;e, who endeavoured to e&s;tabli&s;h his own fame on the ruins of this favourite &s;y&s;tem of his predece&s;&s;ors. A&s;clepiades, who was a man of a bold and daring genius, not only rejected this apparently well founded doctrine of the ancients, but treated the idea of it with ridicule. His arguments are ingenious and acute; but they fall &s;hort of the truth. The pa|roxy&s;ms or exacerbations, as he ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, &s;ome|times change to the even days, and con&s;equently the cri&s;is: yet this, if properly under&s;tood, does not de&s;|troy the generality of the rules;&mdash;if the method of calculating the time, by the periods and revolutions of the di&s;ea&s;e, be adopted, the difficulty is perfectly removed. But though this fact in reality, was not unknown to A&s;clepiades; yet it does not appear, that he under&s;tood the application of it. I may add, that
<PB N="35" REF="028890_0044_0FDE6801846820C8">
he has precipiately rejected the doctrine, from the very circum&s;tance which e&s;tabli&s;hes its reality.</P>
<P>We do not meet with any thing very material, on the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, between the time of A&s;cle|piades, and the days of Galen. There appears, in|deed, to have been many, who adopting the opinion, and copying the arguments of the eloquent Bethy|nian, denied altogether the exi&s;tence of critical pe|riods in fevers; whil&s;t others, recurring to the doc|trine of Hippocrates, maintained their reality with no le&s;s ob&s;tinacy. But we are now in a great mea|&s;ure ignorant, if tho&s;e writers attempted to &s;upport their opinions by any new facts, or new arguments. Among other misfortunes, we mu&s;t regret particu|larly, that the treati&s;e of Aretaeus on fevers is lo&s;t. From what we know of this author's indu&s;try we might have rea&s;onably expected original information on the &s;ubject in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>Galen, who&s;e fertile and exuberant genius left no path in phy&s;ic unexplored, has written fully on this celebrated doctrine. He has profe&s;&s;edly adopted the opinion of Hippocrates, and laboured much to ex|plain and confirm it; but unfortunately, he has oftener overwhelmed the &s;ubject with diffu&s;e and tedious rea&s;onings, than illu&s;trated it by proofs from expe|rience and actual ob&s;ervation. Upon the whole, however, amid&s;t much &s;uperfluous and unmeaning matter, we find not only u&s;eful information, but a more &s;y&s;tematic arrangement of facts, than is any where to be met with. He has attempted to fix with more preci&s;ion the date of inva&s;ion; he has e&s;timated with more accuracy the critical power of the diffe|rent days; and further, has hinted ob&s;curely, that the time will be calculated mo&s;t conveniently by the pa|roxy&s;ms or revolutions of the di&s;ea&s;e. In &s;hort, this author, no le&s;s than A&s;clepiades, was &s;ufficiently ac|quainted with the principal truths, which give con|&s;i&s;tency to this doctrine; but it is evident, that he
<PB N="36" REF="028890_0045_0FDE68034A77A448">
did not under&s;tand the full extent of their application. He was con&s;tantly bia&s;&s;ed by the theory of a quater|nary period; as without this predilection, it is not ea&s;y to conceive, how he &s;hould have con&s;idered the fourteenth, as critical of tertians, where the parox|y&s;ms happen on the odd days, and where the termin|ation, as he acknowledges, con&s;tantly follows the &s;olution of a paroxy&s;m. The latitude likewi&s;e which he a&s;&s;umes, in explaining the apparent irregularities, is much too great. If we are permitted to reckon either the beginning or the termination of a paroxy&s;m, as the critical period, according as it &s;hall be&s;t &s;uit our theory, it is ea&s;y to elude the mo&s;t po&s;itive te&s;ti|monies of experience. Yet, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e defects, the different tracts of Galen on this &s;ubject, de&s;erve to be carefully read. The facts they contain, though &s;ometimes mi&s;applied, are often important; and though we are not always &s;atisfied with the rea|&s;onings of the author, we are a&s;toni&s;hed at the amaz|ing ma&s;s of learning and knowledge found in his works.</P>
<P>There is little new information, on the &s;ubject of critical days, to be met with in the writings of tho&s;e Greek phy&s;icians, who were po&s;terior to the time of Galen. AEtius Amidenus, indeed, brings into nar|rower compa&s;s the &s;ub&s;tance of the doctrines of his predece&s;&s;ors. He mentions likewi&s;e, the mo&s;t ma|terial of tho&s;e circum&s;tances, which influence the deviations from the regular cri&s;is; but it is evident, that he has not &s;ufficiently under&s;tood their applica|tion. Alexander Frallianus, who was an excellent practitioner, and a man of long experience, pa&s;&s;es over this &s;ubject without particular notice; and though Paulus of AEgina has detailed the opinions of Galen in a more compre&s;&s;ed form, than they are found in the original author; yet he has not added any new ob&s;ervations of his own. From the manner, indeed, in which he &s;peaks, of the peculiar virtue of
<PB N="37" REF="028890_0046_0FDE680497DADF60">
the &s;eventh and fourteenth, we &s;hould be apt to be|lieve, that he is not altogether free from prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in favour of the Pythagorean numbers.</P>
<P>It was rea&s;onable to have expected information, on the &s;ubject of critical days, from the writings of the Arabian phy&s;icians. The Arabians inhabit a country, were the periodical movements of nature are perhaps more clearly marked, than in our north|ern latitudes. Some di&s;tricts of their country like|wi&s;e were famous for the &s;ciences at an early period, though it does not indeed appear that much of this knowledge de&s;cended in a direct channel to the Ara|bians of the pre&s;ent times. The Arabian phy&s;icians, in many in&s;tances, enriched medical practice with new forms of remedies; but they have for the mo&s;t part only adopted the theoretical doctrines of the Greeks, particularly of Galen. Avicenna, the mo&s;t famous among their phy&s;icians, and undoubtedly a great man, has Galen con&s;tantly in his eye: in &s;hort, he has done little more on the &s;ubject of critical days, at lea&s;t, than merely tran&s;late the opinions and argu|ments of the celebrated Greek. He attempts, indeed, to be more explicit in a&s;certaining the date of inva|&s;ion; but he does not in fact, go much beyond his predece&s;&s;ors;&mdash;hinting only ob&s;curely, that the cri|tical days ought to be calculated from the proper for|mation of the type, or the di&s;tinct inva&s;ion of the fever. He has added, however, that the odd days, are properly the critical days of the &s;ingle tertian, and that the eleventh of cour&s;e, obtains rank of the fourteenth in this di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>There are many authors, who have written on this &s;ubject, &s;ince the arrival of &s;cience in Europe; but there are few that I have met with, who have thrown light on it from their own ob&s;ervations. The mo&s;t of them have borrowed the opinion from Hippocrates; and accordingly have attempted to e&s;ta|bli&s;h the truth of it, on the facts which are found in
<PB N="38" REF="028890_0047_0FDE680D5261E6F0">
the writings of that author; facts, which, on enquiry, will &s;carcely be found to be accurate enough to be made the ba&s;is of a general doctrine. It would be time ill &s;pent, to enter into a detail of the arguments of this numerous li&s;t of writers; who, in reality, have oftener attempted to &s;upport their opinions by the authority of Galen and the ancients, than by the facts which might have been found in their own ex|perience. From writers, however, of this de&s;crip|tion, it would be unju&s;t, not to &s;eparate Hoffman, an author, who has related with candour the re&s;ult of his own ob&s;ervations, in a practice of forty years and upwards. The facts which Hoffman mentions, throw con&s;iderable light on the &s;ubject; yet &s;till they do not remove all the difficulty. They neither ena|ble us to form an e&s;timate of the power of the differ|ent critical days; neither do they at all a&s;&s;i&s;t us in comprehending the cau&s;e of the deviations. There are probably other modern authors be&s;ides Hoffman, who have treated of the power of critical days in fe|vers; but, except Dr. Cullen, I have not met with any one, who has left any ob&s;ervations which de&s;erve much notice. This celebrated phy&s;ician is a warm advocate of the ancient doctrine of critical days. He &s;ub&s;cribes profe&s;&s;edly to the arrangements of Hippo|crates; though he adds likewi&s;e the re&s;ult of his own ob&s;ervation, in the various kinds of fevers of this country.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t eminent of the ancient and the mo&s;t &s;y&s;tematic of the modern phy&s;icians, all agree in a&s;|cribing to certain days a particular power in termi|nating; yet they do not &s;o perfectly coincide in the arrangement they have given of tho&s;e days, or in the cau&s;es they have a&s;&s;igned for the particular pre-emi|nence. The incon&s;i&s;tency of Hippocrates has, per|haps, been in &s;ome mea&s;ure the &s;ource of this diver|&s;ity of opinion. In one place, this author has ranked the twentieth as the proper critical day in fevers; in &s;ome others, this power is attributed to the twenty-fir&s;t.
<PB N="39" REF="028890_0048_0FDE680E47BA7078">
That the twenty-fir&s;t is properly the day of cri&s;is, was the opinion of Archegen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s and Diocles; that it &s;hould be &s;o, is not incon&s;i&s;tent with the ge|neral principle of the Hippocratic doctrine; <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the movements of a quaternary period. So far is clear; but as it was ob&s;erved by Hippocrates, as well as by other authors, that the twentieth was &s;till more fre|quently a day of cri&s;is than the twenty-fir&s;t, a <GAP DESC="foreign"> on the fourteenth, was introduced to account for this apparent deviation from the general rule. This idea of <GAP DESC="foreign">, or accumulation of one period on ano|ther, which is mentioned in the writings of Hippo|crates, originated perhaps in the doctrine of Pytha|goras. It is adopted by Galen, and it appears in reality to be occa&s;ionally true; yet it can never be con&s;idered as an e&s;tabli&s;hed principle in the move|ments of febrile di&s;ea&s;es. By means of &s;uch accu|mulation, however, Galen has attempted to e&s;tabli&s;h the pre-eminence of the twentieth, which he con|&s;iders as the real critical day of Hippocrates. That the twentieth&mdash;(not the twenty-fir&s;t) is actually the critical day of Hippocrates, is likewi&s;e decidedly the opinion of Dr. Cullen, who, going a &s;tep farther than his predece&s;&s;ors, endeavours to &s;upport his a&s;|&s;ertion by &s;ome arguments, which are entirely new. This ingenious author hazards the bold conjecture, that the appearance of the twenty-fir&s;t, in the writings of Hippocrates, has ari&s;en wholly from accidental error in the original manu&s;cript: but with all due deference to &s;uch re&s;pectable authority, I mu&s;t beg leave to &s;ugge&s;t, that the twenty-fir&s;t occurs too fre|quently in tho&s;e writings, which have been a&s;cribed to the Coan Sage, to give countenance to the opi|nion, that it owes its place, as a critical day, to care|le&s;s error. The other argument is more ingenious; but perhaps not better founded. This writer has ventured to maintain, that the type of febrile di&s;ea&s;es changes to quartan after the eleventh; but I can &s;ee
<PB N="40" REF="028890_0049_0FDE681002F67410">
no good rea&s;on for the &s;uppo&s;ition. Medical writers have repeatedly noticed in&s;tances of cri&s;is, on the thirteenth, and fifteenth; even my own experience, narrow as it has been, furni&s;hes me with &s;ufficient evidence, that cri&s;is actually do happen at the above-mentioned periods.</P>
<P>As tho&s;e days, which have been chiefly con&s;idered as critical, are now &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;ufficiently known, it will not be &s;uperfluous in the next place, to take a &s;hort view of the cau&s;es, on which the particular pre-eminence has been thought immediately to de|pend. The quaternary period, which in reality is a period of four, and a period of three days &s;ucceeding each other alternately, is the general principle a&s;|&s;umed by ancient phy&s;icians, to explain this arrange|ment. But if we continue to pur&s;ue the undi&s;turbed movements of a quaternary period, we &s;hall bring the eighteenth and twenty-fir&s;t into the order of cri|tical days, rather than the &s;eventeenth, and twentieth. The contrary is in fact the ca&s;e. To obviate there|fore this difficulty, or to reconcile ob&s;ervation with theory, a <GAP DESC="foreign"> has been &s;uppo&s;ed to take place on the fourteenth. That a <GAP DESC="foreign">, or as it may be tran&s;lated, the accumulation of the beginning of one period on the extremity of another, frequently takes place, cannot be denied; but its appearance is not determined by a fixed law. It is ob&s;erved on the &s;e|venth, on the fourteenth; in &s;hort, on any day what|ever. The quaternary period, with <GAP DESC="foreign"> on the fourteenth, is the only principle employed by the an|cients for explaining the u&s;ual arrangement of the critical days; yet I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that it is capable of doing this, only in a very imperfect manner; it totally excludes &s;ome days of very con&s;iderable pow|er. Dr. Cullen, &s;en&s;ible, perhaps, of this defect, &s;ug|ge&s;ted that there was a chance from the tertian to the quartan type on the eleventh. This change, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, explains with perfect plau&s;ibility
<PB N="41" REF="028890_0050_0FDE6811625D1A98">
the pre-eminence of the fourteenth, &s;eventeenth and twentieth; but there is the &s;tronge&s;t rea&s;on to believe, that it does not in fact take place. I mentioned be|fore, that in&s;tances are recorded by medical writers of cri&s;is, which have happened on the thirteenth, fif|teenth, and the other days, which are not included in the quartan period; and I can add from my own ex|perience, that where the di&s;ea&s;e was of &s;uch a kind, that a type could be clearly traced; no &s;uch change, as this author has &s;ugge&s;ted, was ever &s;een.</P>
<P>Having ventured to declare, that the cau&s;es, which have been hitherto a&s;&s;igned for the pre-emi|nence of certain critical days in fevers, are extremely defective; the facts, which I have mentioned before, it is pre&s;umed, may enable us, if they are properly under&s;tood, to give a more &s;atisfactory explanation of this &s;ingular phenomenon. There are few people of experience and ob&s;ervation, who do not know that the tertian is the mo&s;t prevailing type in febrile di&s;|ea&s;es. This, at fir&s;t &s;ight, gives a general pre-eminence to the odd days; but though the tertian period pre|vails very generally in fevers, yet it mu&s;t al&s;o be re|membered, that the&s;e revolutions are &s;ometimes com|pleted in a &s;horter &s;pace of time than the regular pe|riod; whil&s;t the types are frequently found to be doubled, or even more variou&s;ly combined. In con|&s;equence of the&s;e accidents, apparent irregularities are often produced in the order of the critical days; though they may be all &s;atisfactorily accounted for, by calculating the time by the periods of the di&s;ea&s;e, or by &s;implifying tho&s;e types which are more evi|dently complicated. By attending to the circum|&s;tances I have mentioned, all the difficulties may be ea&s;ily removed in periodical fevers; but as numerous in&s;tances of fevers occur, where no type can be clearly traced; &s;o it is nece&s;&s;ary in &s;uch ca&s;es to &s;eek for &s;ome other principle, which may be capable of ex|plaining apparent irregularities. There very &s;eldom
<PB N="42" REF="028890_0051_0FDE6816F8E84490">
perhaps happens an in&s;tance of fever of long conti|nuance, where the &s;ymptoms do not undergo &s;ome change in the cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e. Tho&s;e changes or revolutions are generally at con&s;iderable intervals, frequently at an interval of &s;even days. The circum|&s;tances by which tho&s;e changes are indicated, are not by any means ob&s;cure; and, perhaps, there would not be great error, if we con&s;idered them as the commence|ment of a new complaint; at lea&s;t by con&s;idering them as &s;uch, the general principle of the critical days is pre|&s;erved con&s;i&s;tent and uniform throughout. I &s;hall men|tion &s;uch explanations as have occurred mo&s;t frequently in my own practice. It often happened, that the &s;ymptoms of the di&s;ea&s;e underwent a material change on the fifth. It terminated on the ninth, or perhaps only put on a new appearance on the ninth, its final termination not happening till after another period of five days. In the &s;ame manner, a change of &s;ymp|toms on the &s;eventh, was followed by a cri&s;is on the thirteenth; or if the change of &s;ymptoms was not ob&s;erved till the ninth, the cri&s;is probably did not make its appearance till the &s;eventeenth. Such change of &s;ymptoms on the odd days, (where we may &s;ay with propriety enough, that one di&s;ea&s;e was ac|cumulated upon another), there being &s;eldom any pre|vious marks of cri&s;is, was by no means uncommon; yet it happened &s;till oftener, that the paroxy&s;m of the odd day declined; the original di&s;ea&s;e terminated im|perfectly, whil&s;t a new one began the day following, which was an even day. By &s;uch accidents the or|der of the days of cri&s;is was changed. And from the la&s;t mentioned cau&s;e the fourteenth, as a &s;e|cond &s;eventh, becomes remarkable among the critical periods of fevers. This idea of a &s;econd &s;eventh oc|curred to me many years ago, and long before I was acquainted with the opinions of Hippocrates or of Galen. It now receives information from the te&s;|timony of the&s;e careful ob&s;ervers. There are many,
<PB N="43" REF="028890_0052_0FDE681B8D212520">
I make no doubt, who will be di&s;po&s;ed to treat it with ridicule; but I &s;hall combat their opinion with no other argument than a reque&s;t, that they write down carefully the hi&s;tory of a tedious fever, and afterwards review its cour&s;e without prejudice or partiality.</P>
<P>I now only beg leave to add, that the facts which I have mentioned in the preceding pages are circum|&s;tantial, and give room to conclude, that by &s;implify|ing complicated types, by calculating the time by the revolutions of the di&s;ea&s;e, or by beginning to date a &s;econd time from tho&s;e great and remarkable changes, which happen at more di&s;tant periods, a doctrine is formed, perfectly uniform and con&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf. It is confirmed by every ob&s;ervation which I have been hitherto able to make. It is no more indeed, than an analy&s;is of tho&s;e &s;everal ca&s;es, which have occurred in my own practice; which in periodical fevers at lea&s;t, has been tolerably exten&s;ive.</P>
<P>But though the prevalence of a tertian type, ex|plains &s;atisfactorily the general critical power of the odd days; and tho&s;e other circum&s;tances, which I have likewi&s;e taken notice of, account no le&s;s clearly for all the deviations, which are ob&s;erved to take place; yet if we attempt to &s;eek for a cau&s;e of this type, or of tho&s;e changes, which happen at more di&s;|tant, particularly at the &s;eptenary periods, our pro|gre&s;s is &s;oon &s;topt. Galen, who &s;eldom he&s;itates in explaining the phenomena of nature, acknowledges here that he was unwillingly drawn to a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the &s;ubject. The que&s;tion undoubtedly is a difficult one; and, it is to be feared, mu&s;t remain for ever unknown. In the Ea&s;t, where the powers of the human mind were not only earlier developed; but where men, from climate and modes of life, were led more early to ob&s;erve the motions of nature, &s;tated and periodical movements were &s;oon di&s;covered in the economy of the &s;ublunary &s;y&s;tem.

there is rea&s;on to believe, is one of the countries where the&s;e revolutions were fir&s;t taken notice of; at lea&s;t it was on the banks of the Nile, that the Greek philo&s;ophers fir&s;t gathered the &s;eeds of natural &s;cience. Among the knowledge or opinions, which the&s;e &s;ages carried back to their native country, we may reckon the doctrine of the power of numbers; which though disfigured perhaps by the metaphy&s;ical genius of the philo&s;opher of Samos, has ob&s;ervation in &s;ome degree for its ba&s;is. It does not concern us at pre&s;ent to enter into a particular di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this opinion; but as far as relates to the &s;ubject in que&s;tion, we cannot refu&s;e acknowledging, that the frame of man is liable to regular changes, at particular periods, compre|hended in a certain number of days and hours. But though this general truth is indi&s;putable, yet there is no argument which leads us to &s;uppo&s;e, that tho&s;e changes are, in any degree, influenced by an harmo|nic proportion in the &s;imple number of the days. Ill founded however as this doctrine obviou&s;ly is, it was in high fa&s;hion with the Greeks in the time of Hippocrates; and &s;eems evidently to have had &s;ome influence on the opinions of this author. Without &s;uch a prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, indeed, it is not ea&s;y to conceive, how he could have fabricated the &s;y&s;tem which he has given to the world; as it by no means re&s;ults from the facts which are found in his writings. Galen in this, as in mo&s;t &s;ubjects, follows the foot&s;teps of Hippocrates. He di&s;claims, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, the <HI>power of numbers,</HI> &s;imply as numbers having any effect upon the mo&s;t u&s;ual days of cri&s;is; but he maintains the influence of a quaternary period, which appears very plainly to be a remnant of the doctrine of Pythagoras. However, after exhau&s;ting him&s;elf, and fatiguing his readers with a detail of u&s;ele&s;s con|jectures, he at la&s;t ventures to conclude, that the bu|&s;ine&s;s of cri&s;is is to be referred ultimately to the cour&s;e and different a&s;pects of the moon. The opi|nion,
<PB N="45" REF="028890_0054_0FDE681E06ED7BB8">
like many others recorded by the Greek phy|&s;icians, draw its origin from Egypt. It is not, per|haps, altogether without appearance of plau&s;ibility; yet I mu&s;t add, that if the moon has in reality any influence in this bu&s;ine&s;s, the laws which regulate its effects are ob&s;cure;&mdash;indeed, not in the lea&s;t un|der&s;tood. The conjecture however, fanciful as it appears to be, met with the general a&s;&s;ent of medical writers, till about the middle of the &s;ixteenth cen|tury, when Fraca&s;torious, a man of ingenuity and elegant g&egrave;nius, attempted to &s;ub&s;titute another in its place; though unfortunately, not a more probable one than that of his predece&s;&s;ors. This author, after a di&s;play of much learning and general knowledge, at la&s;t ventures to conclude, that the power of the different days of cri&s;is, depends on peculiarities in the laws of motion of the different humours, which give ri&s;e to the different &s;pecies of the di&s;ea&s;e: but with regard to this hypothe&s;is, it is only nece&s;&s;ary to remark, that while the very exi&s;tence of the humours is doubted with rea&s;on, there can be no certainty in determining the laws of their motions. But though the opinion of Galen, and this of Fraca&s;torius, are only vague and very que&s;tionable conjectures; yet they are the only ones, &s;o far as I know, which have been offered to the public. The &s;ubject is too in|tricate, perhaps, ever to be explained. For though we clearly perceive that fevers are u&s;ually of a &s;tated duration; yet we are unable to perceive, whether this duration depends on &s;omething inexplicable in the peculiar nature of the cau&s;e, which cea&s;es to act, or changes its mode of action at a certain period; or to &s;ome imperceptible revolution in the human frame, which de&s;troys in a given &s;pace of time, that parti|cular aptitude between the &s;tate of the body and the morbid cau&s;e, in which the di&s;ea&s;e may be &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t. This only we know with certainty, that where the febrile motions are violent and continual,
<PB N="46" REF="028890_0055_0FDE6826D0DB8958">
the di&s;ea&s;e ha&s;tens to a termination; where they are languid and feeble, or &s;uffer long interruptions, its duration is often drawn out to an undetermined length of time. Thus continued fevers, with in|flammatory diathe&s;is and much vi&s;cular excitement, for the mo&s;t part terminate decidedly in &s;even or nine days; while tho&s;e with low and languid motions, with long and di&s;tinct intermi&s;&s;ions, as the quartan, and even &s;ometime the tertian, continue for months, and decline at la&s;t by &s;low and almo&s;t imperceptible degrees.</P>
<P>It may &s;eem that I have treated very fully of the critical days of fevers; yet before leaving the &s;ubject altogether, there is one thing &s;till which requires to be mentioned;&mdash;I mean the great proportion of fa|tal terminations, which happen on the even days. The even days were ob&s;erved to be fatal in the pro|portion of three to one, in tho&s;e fevers, which came under my care during the time that I lived in Ja|maica. The fact, which is curious and hitherto I believe unnoticed, was di&s;covered in the following manner. That I might the better trace the progre&s;s of nature through the whole cour&s;e of the fever, a &s;ubject which then engro&s;&s;ed my chief attention, I vi&s;ited often, and &s;pent much of my time in the apartments of the &s;ick. Among other things, I di&s;|covered the manner in which death more u&s;ually ap|proached. The natural cour&s;e of the paroxy&s;m ap|peared generally to be fini&s;hed, or the action of the febrile cau&s;e &s;eemed actually to have cea&s;ed. The lightning before death, as it is termed, which has been generally attributed to the la&s;t efforts of dying nature was frequently &s;een to take place. This was even &s;ometimes &s;o remarkable, as to give flattering hopes of a favourable cri&s;is; yet in a &s;hort &s;pace of time, the powers of life begun to fail, and at la&s;t were gradually extingui&s;hed, like an expiring taper.&mdash;The cri&s;is, &s;trictly &s;peaking, happened on the odd days, equally the &s;ame in tho&s;e who died, as in tho&s;e
<PB N="47" REF="028890_0056_0FDE6827C5981548">
who recovered; only I had inaccurately, accu&s;tomed my&s;elf to refer the critical period to that moment, were the &s;igns of cri&s;is were fir&s;t perceived; in the other, I had con&s;idered it as happening at the hour of actual death. Thus it was ob&s;erved in tho&s;e fe|vers which terminated fatally on the even days, that the powers of life, though irrecoverably exhau&s;ted, were not totally extingui&s;hed by the paroxy&s;m of the odd day. This paroxy&s;m, in &s;hort, &s;eemed to de|cline after the u&s;ual duration. It left the body, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, free from di&s;ea&s;e; but &s;o completely deranged in the vital functions, that the action of living, though it often went on for a few hours, could not be continued long. In this manner, the hour of death was frequently protracted to the even day; yet death happened &s;ometimes on the even days, from another cau&s;e. The decline of the paroxy&s;m, which in many ca&s;es was hardly perceptible, in others was very plain. The di&s;ea&s;e terminated; but a new one recurring, after a &s;hort interval, &s;peedily put a pe|riod to exi&s;tence. In the mild fever of Jamaica, death u&s;ually approached in the gradual manner I have ju&s;t de&s;cribed; yet in ca&s;es of much violence and malignity, the fatal termination was frequently on an odd day. In &s;uch ca&s;es the patient died in the height of the paroxy&s;m, carried off by convul&s;ions, apoplexy, or other accident.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e authors, who, &s;ince the time of A&s;clepiades, have denied the power of critical days in fevers, are numerous; and many of them po&s;&s;e&s;s con&s;iderable authority in the medical world. Their opinions, however, cannot be con&s;idered as of great influence in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, though they may a&s;&s;ert, that they never have ob&s;erved the pre-eminence of any parti|cular days in terminating febrile di&s;ea&s;es; &s;uch an a&s;|&s;ertion means but little; unle&s;s its author convinces us, that he has adopted a method of inve&s;tigation by which tho&s;e regular movements, if they actually ex|i&s;ted,
<PB N="48" REF="028890_0057_0FDE682958340F68">
could not fail to be di&s;covered. Truth in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, can only be known from minute and careful ob&s;ervation; but a train of minute ob&s;erva|tion is not likely to be the work of a bu&s;y phy&s;ician; and one, who is little employed, has not &s;ufficient materials in his practice to engage his attention to a continued pur&s;uit. I con&s;ider it as my own good fortune, to have been placed between the two ex|tremes of idlene&s;s and too much bu&s;ine&s;s. In the country where I re&s;ided for &s;ome time, the movements of nature were generally &s;o di&s;tinct, as to be ob&s;erved without much difficulty; my practice likewi&s;e was &s;ufficient to employ my mind, and not more than it could comprehend ea&s;ily; &s;o that I had &s;ufficient lei|&s;ure to write down, and to dige&s;t the ob&s;ervations which I have related above. They afford, if I mi&s;|take not, &s;ome facts which are preci&s;e and pointed; and which &s;uper&s;ede a multitude of arguments. I will not venture to &s;ay, that they remove all the my&s;|tery from this dark &s;ubject; but I cannot help flat|tering my&s;elf, that they point out a road by which we may continue our inve&s;tigations with &s;ucce&s;s. The &s;ubject of critical days is of &s;uch importance, as to demand every attention. A knowledge of it gives credibility to our art; whil&s;t ignorance in this re&s;pect <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s the &s;ource of perpetual mi&s;take and di&s;appointment. There are many phy&s;icians of the pre&s;ent day, who treat the idea of critical days with ridicule; but their a&s;&s;ertions only afford an argument of their own pre|cipitancy, and &s;uperficial ob&s;ervation. The man in reality, who pretends to cure a fever, without a knowledge of the critical periods of nature, is no le&s;s pre&s;umptuous, than the mariner, who undertakes to conduct a ve&s;&s;el through the ocean, without being in&s;tructed in the manner of calculating her cour&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. OF THE GENERAL REMOTE CAUSES OF INTER|MITTING AND REMITTING FEVERS.</HEAD>
<P>THE general remote cau&s;es of intermitting and remitting fevers have been &s;o fully inve&s;ti|gated by &s;everal eminent writers, particularly by the indu&s;trious and learned Lanci&s;i, that little remains to be added: nor perhaps &s;hould I have thought it ne|ce&s;&s;ary, even to have mentioned the &s;ubject, were it not to take notice of &s;ome opinions of the late Sir John Pringle, which appear to have been formed too precipitately; and which, I can affirm from experi|ence, have been pernicious to the health of thou&s;ands. It would be a very needle&s;s o&s;tentation to adduce the authority of the ancients, to prove the general &s;ource of the di&s;ea&s;e which is the &s;ubject of the pre&s;ent trea|ti&s;e. The hi&s;torians, no le&s;s than the phy&s;icians of every age, do not entertain a doubt, that fevers of the intermitting and remitting kind, owe their origin to exhalations from &s;wampy and moi&s;t grounds. Daily experience &s;till proves it; and there are few men who&s;e ob&s;ervations are &s;o circum&s;cribed, as not to know, that it is in the neighbourhood of &s;wamps, and near the banks of fre&s;h water rivers, that tho&s;e di&s;orders chiefly prevail. But though it is only in the above &s;ituations, that intermitting and remitting fevers are more peculiarly epidemic; yet it likewi&s;e de&s;erves to be remarked, that, independent of the particular circum&s;tances of &s;oil and local &s;ituation, the endemic of champaign countries is &s;ubject, in a greater or le&s;s degree, to an appearance of period|ical revolution. Mud and &s;tagnant water, in every climate, po&s;&s;e&s;s the materials of the cau&s;e of this &s;pecies of di&s;ea&s;e; but a combination of other cir|cum&s;tances
<PB N="50" REF="028890_0059_0FDE6833E1237D70">
is required to give them activity. Among the principal of tho&s;e circum&s;tances, which call forth this action, we may reckon the influence of a pow|erful &s;un. Hence, (as is commonly known), &s;ome &s;ituations, which, in the colder months of winter, are di&s;tingui&s;hed for no particular di&s;ea&s;e, in the hot months of &s;ummer and autumn, are ob&s;erved to be mo&s;t malignantly unhealthful.</P>
<P>The nature of this exhalation or cau&s;e of fever, though it has long been a &s;ubject of enquiry, remains &s;till unknown. We plainly perceive it to be of va|rious degrees of force, and in various &s;tates of con|centration; and we can ea&s;ily conceive it to be va|riou&s;ly modified and combined;&mdash;but we go no far|ther. It has been &s;aid, to po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;eptic principle; but this alone will &s;carcely be thought &s;ufficient, to account for the very peculiar manner in which it affects the human race. Some other quality is ne|ce&s;&s;arily joined with it, which our &s;en&s;es cannot lay hold of. But though the ingenuity of man has not hitherto been able to penetrate the intimate nature of this cau&s;e of fever, we &s;till have it in our power, in &s;ome degree, to trace its effects on the human con|&s;titution. We plainly perceive that an habitual ex|po&s;ure to it, is peculiarly <HI>unfriendly</HI> to the principle of life, and in a very remarkable manner &s;hortens the period of exi&s;tence. In proof of this I mention from good authority, that white females, born and con&s;tantly re&s;iding in the lower di&s;tricts of the pro|vince of Georgia in America, have &s;eldom been ob|&s;erved to live beyond the age of forty. Males, &s;ometimes approach near to fifty; while Europeans, who had arrived at manhood before they came to the country, often attain a good old age. The fact is curious, and &s;hews, in a &s;trong point of view, the deleterious quality of the air of tho&s;e climates. But though the general nature of the country, which I have ju&s;t now mentioned, is unhealthy in a high de|gree;
<PB N="51" REF="028890_0060_0FDE6834A44051B8">
yet there are &s;ituations, in the Carolinas and Virginia, which are de&s;tructive of life in a &s;till more remarkable manner. There is not on record, I am credibly informed, an in&s;tance of a per&s;on born at Peter&s;borough in Virginia, and con&s;tantly re&s;iding in the &s;ame place, who has lived to the age of twenty-one. When the Briti&s;h army marched through this province, in the year 1781, I had the opportunity of &s;eeing a native of this town, who was then in his twentieth year; but he was &s;aid to be the fir&s;t, who had ever attained &s;o advanced an age. He was de|crepid, as if from the defects of time, and it did not appear that he could &s;urvive many months. Yet it is not a little curious, that this man had never been much confined with &s;ickne&s;s. The re&s;iding con|&s;tantly in the &s;ame pernicious air, &s;eemed alone to have been &s;ufficient &s;o remarkably to accelerate de|crepitude. But though the in&s;tances I have men|tioned, afford &s;ufficient proof, that this mia&s;ma is un|friendly to the principle of life; yet we are by no means in&s;tructed, as to the manner, by which it be|comes &s;o. This &s;eems to be one of the arcana of nature; and it will profit little to pro&s;ecute it farther by conjecture. It will, however be an object of utility to mark the &s;oils and &s;ituations in which the exhala|tion mo&s;t abounds, and to trace the cau&s;es which heighten or lower its activity.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of the remote cau&s;es of intermitting and remitting fevers, with all the circum&s;tances con|nected with them, having been, as I &s;aid before, &s;o fully inve&s;tigated by others, I &s;hall only add a few cur&s;ory remarks, where the information does not &s;eem to be &s;ufficiently preci&s;e, or where the conclu|&s;ions, which have been made, are not ju&s;tifiable by experience. It is an opinion, which, though it did not originate with Sylvius de le Boe, evidently gained weight from his authority&mdash;that a mixture of &s;alt with fre&s;h water, as corrupting more ea&s;ily, af|fords
<PB N="52" REF="028890_0061_0FDE6834A44051B8">
a more noxious exhalation than fre&s;h water alone. Lanci&s;i has mentioned the ob&s;ervation; and Sir John Pringle con&s;iders it as an e&s;tabli&s;hed fact; but the evidence, by which he attempts to &s;upport his opinion, is not deci&s;ive. It would be in vain to deny, that the neighbourhood of lakes or rivers, with a mixture of &s;alt water, is often highly unhealthful; yet we may affirm with confidence, that it is &s;eldom more &s;o, than where the lakes and rivers are perfectly unmixed. In proof of this a&s;&s;ertion, I might adduce the example of Savanna la Mar in Jamaica, or draw in&s;tances from the numerous i&s;lands on the coa&s;t of the Carolinas; where &s;ea and river water are often blended together in various proportions; to which might be added, the more particular evidence of the relative healthine&s;s of the banks of rivers. So far as I have ob&s;erved, the u&s;ual endemic was le&s;s fre|quent, and le&s;s formidable on the banks of rivers, after their waters became mixed with tho&s;e of the &s;ea, than before this happened; unle&s;s the circum|&s;tances were in other re&s;pects more favourable for the production of the di&s;ea&s;e. Hence there is but little rea&s;on for &s;uppo&s;ing, that there actually exi&s;ts any degree of mixture of &s;alt with fre&s;h water, at lea&s;t of running water, which ab&s;olutely heightens the noxious quality of the exhalation. The above is an opinion of &s;ufficient con&s;equence to demand in|ve&s;tigation: but there is another advanced by this celebrated author, wor&s;e founded, and of &s;till greater concern, which I &s;hall likewi&s;e mention. From an idea that a free circulation of air, is of all things the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential to the pre&s;ervation of health, Sir John Pringle enjoins in a very po&s;itive manner, not only that open ground, but that the banks of large rivers &s;hould be cho&s;en, in preference to other &s;ituations, for the encampment of troops. This author's opportu|tunities of information were good; his opinion has therefore gained weight, and his advice, I am afraid,
<PB N="53" REF="028890_0062_0FDE683785CD2B20">
has been often fatally followed. It would be no dif|ficult ta&s;k to produce te&s;timonies, from both ancient and modern hi&s;tory, of the unhealthine&s;s of tho&s;e &s;itu|ations, which Sir John Pringle has thought proper to recommend; but at pre&s;ent I &s;hall confine my&s;elf to that, which has more immediately fallen under my own ob&s;ervation. The in&s;tance I &s;hall mention, is only a &s;ingle one; but it proves &s;o clearly the danger of encamping on the banks of fre&s;h water rivers, as to render all others &s;uperfluous. In June 1780, the fir&s;t battalion of the 71&s;t regiment was detached to the Cheraws, where it encamped on open ground, within five hundred paces of the river Pedee. The people of the country, taught by experience, &s;ugge&s;ted the propriety of drawing back the encampment into what is called the Pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">-barren, a&s;&s;igning as the cau&s;e of their advice, that the di&s;tance, as well as the cover of the wood, might be a &s;ecurity again&s;t the damps of the river, which were ob&s;erved to be extremely noxious in that climate. A po&s;ition in wood, acce&s;|&s;ible on all &s;ides, would not perhaps have been mili|tary; &s;o that no alteration was made. The other bat|talion of the regiment joined in July. It arrived in perfect health, and encamped likewi&s;e on open ground; but &s;till nearer the river. In a fortnight the inter|mitting fever began to make its appearance; and in le&s;s than three weeks, more than two thirds of the men were ill; whil&s;t &s;carcely one of the officers had e&s;caped. The officers, it mu&s;t be remarked, en|camped in the rear of the men, and immediately on the bank of the river, the cour&s;e of which was un|commonly &s;low at this place; while its banks, though high, were oozy and foul. There are few in&s;tances on record perhaps, where a degree of &s;ickne&s;s, greater than the pre&s;ent, has been ob&s;erved in &s;o &s;hort a &s;pace of time. The fir&s;t battalion, however, did not &s;uffer in the &s;ame proportion. The ground
<PB N="54" REF="028890_0063_0FDE683785CD2B20">
of encampment was not only at a greater di&s;tance from the river; but being al&s;o nearer to a wood, many of tho&s;e, who were not confined by their duty to a particular &s;pot, found a convenient &s;helter in its &s;hade, from the powerful heat of the &s;un. The&s;e I mu&s;t not omit to mention, were the lea&s;t &s;ickly of the whole encampment. The above is an important fact. It proves clearly, that no ideal circulation of air can counterbalance the noxious exhalations from rivers; and it likewi&s;e affords a pre&s;umption, that in|&s;tead of danger, there is &s;afety in the &s;helter of wood. But with regard to this, no ab&s;olute rule can be given. It mu&s;t generally be decided by local circum&s;tances, whether wood, or open ground are to be preferred for the encampment of troops. Upon the whole, however, there are many rea&s;ons to induce us to be|lieve, that as an encampment is not only more mili|tary in the body of a wood, than in open ground &s;ur|rounded by woods; &s;o it is likewi&s;e more &s;afe with re&s;pect to health; particularly if within the reach of effluvia from &s;wamps or rivers. The rea&s;on which offers is obvious. The wood not only &s;tops the pro|gre&s;s of noxious vapours carried from a di&s;tance; but it al&s;o covers the earth from the immediate ac|tion of the &s;un&mdash;the powerful cau&s;e of exhalation; in doing which, it perhaps, does more than counter|balance the le&s;s free circulation of air, or the greater dampne&s;s of the ground. But le&s;t the authority I have mentioned, &s;hould not be thought &s;ufficient, the opinion receives farther confirmation from the te&s;ti|mony of the ancients. Hi&s;tories abound with exam|ples of de&s;tructive epidemics, which have followed the cutting down of groves, which covered mo|ra&s;&s;es, or which intercepted the progre&s;s of mar&s;h ex|halation. America al&s;o furni&s;hes daily in&s;tances of a &s;imilar truth. In this country the unhealthine&s;s of a place is often obviou&s;ly increa&s;ed, by cutting down the woods of the neighbouring &s;wamps: hence no
<PB N="55" REF="028890_0064_0FDE6841AF8D4F30">
rule is more liable to exceptions, than that which has been &s;o generally enforced; <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that clearing a coun|try of its woods invariably renders it healthy: unle&s;s the grounds be drained and cultivated, as well as cleared, the effect is likely to be the rever&s;e.</P>
<P>It would be curious and u&s;eful, could we trace this mia&s;ma or cau&s;e of fever in its progre&s;s. I do not deny that the noxious exhalation may be acci|dentally enveloped in fogs; but it is not nece&s;&s;arily &s;o; and I add, that the dews of night, unle&s;s as an exciting cau&s;e, are le&s;s pernicious than has generally been imagined. Low grounds, in the &s;ame manner, are not always unhealthy; as high and dry &s;ituations &s;ometimes afford no protection again&s;t the ravages of this di&s;ea&s;e. The &s;ituation of the encampment which the 71&s;t regiment occupied at King's-bridge, in the year 1778, affords a curious and direct proof of the truth of this opinion. About two hundred paces to the right of the &s;pot, on which the tents were pitched, was a tract of low and &s;wampy ground; but the im|mediate &s;ituation was dry, and of con&s;iderable eleva|vation. The right was <HI>particularly</HI> &s;o; yet it was principally on the right, where the di&s;ea&s;e raged with violence. The left, though on low ground, over which fogs frequently hung till late in the day, &s;uf|fered in a much &s;maller proportion. From this we might infer, that a dry and elevated &s;ituation is by no means exempted from intermitting and remitting fevers: but the great degree of &s;ickne&s;s, which hap|pened to tho&s;e people, who not being confined by the nature of their duty to one particular &s;pot, pitched their tents on a hill in the rear of the encampment, proves it clearly. The ground, which tho&s;e per&s;ons made choice of was directly in the tract of air, which blew over the &s;wamp. It was dry and &s;carcely ever covered with fogs; yet there was not an individual among them who encamped upon it, who did not &s;uffer from this raging epidemic. The pre&s;ent in|&s;tance,
<PB N="56" REF="028890_0065_0FDE6842C6026BF0">
with many others which I might adduce, leaves little room to doubt, that in&s;tead of expo&s;ing encampments to &s;treams of air, which blow from rivers or &s;wamps, it ought to be our principal bu&s;i|ne&s;s to guard again&s;t tho&s;e noxious effluvia, by the interpo&s;ition of woods or ri&s;ing grounds. Exhalations which are the cau&s;es of fevers are &s;ubtile, and &s;eem to be pernicious, chiefly in their a&s;cent:&mdash;vi&s;ible damps or night dews are comparatively innocent.</P>
<P>So great is the importance of pre&s;erving the health of an army in the field, that the choice of en|campments ought to be made a &s;ubject of particular enquiry. The opinion of Sir John Pringle on this head, (which, in fact, is an opinion of theory rather than ob&s;ervation), has been followed too long with|out examination. The directions of this author are influenced wholly by the dread he entertained of a contagious or ho&s;pital fever; but a contagious fever, is &s;eldom a di&s;ea&s;e of the field; and has, perhaps, &s;carcely ever been known to make its appearance in a moving camp. Di&s;ea&s;es of the field are often epi|demic, &s;ometimes malignant, but rarely contagious. I even doubt if the dy&s;entery, whil&s;t a camp-di&s;ea&s;e, is &s;o in any remarkable degree. It was not &s;o at lea&s;t in America, in tho&s;e campaigns, where I had the op|portunity of knowing the &s;tate of the army.</P>
<P>The general remote cau&s;e of intermitting and re|mitting fevers, con&s;i&s;ts, as was mentioned before, in invi&s;ible exhalations floating in the air. The&s;e are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> copious in &s;ome &s;ituations than in others; and appear to be rendered more or le&s;s active by a great variety of cau&s;es. Among the number of tho&s;e cau&s;es which have been accu&s;ed of exciting fever, it has been u&s;ual to reckon exce&s;s in drinking. It cannot be de|nied, that this cau&s;e, in &s;everal ca&s;es, has brought forth the di&s;ea&s;e, when it probably would not have otherwi&s;e appeared; yet it has been likewi&s;e ob&s;erved that a debauch of wine has &s;ometimes re&s;tored the
<PB N="57" REF="028890_0066_0FDE684445E621C0">
body to health, when langui&s;hing under the influence of this di&s;order in an ob&s;cure or irregular form. The moderate u&s;e of wine, however, has been generally recommended as a pre&s;ervative in times of great heat, and epidemic &s;ickne&s;s:&mdash;and under limitations it undoubtedly is of u&s;e. In a time of very pre&s;&s;ing calamity, the oracle of Delphi gave its &s;anction to the pre&s;cription, and hi&s;tory bears te&s;timony to its &s;uc|ce&s;s. But be&s;ides exce&s;s in drinking, cold and fatigue have likewi&s;e been con&s;idered among exciting cau&s;e of fever. In &s;hort, whatever exhau&s;ts or dimini&s;hes the activity of the powers of life, may be ju&s;tly viewed in this light. Yet &s;till I mu&s;t ob&s;erve that neither cold, fatigue, nor any of the cau&s;es of this train, give occa&s;ion to a proper intermitting or re|mitting fever, unle&s;s the predi&s;po&s;ition to the di&s;ea&s;e be particularly &s;trong. As a proof of this, I mu&s;t beg leave to mention a fact, which fell under my own ob&s;ervation. In an expedition into South Ca|rolina, in the year 1779, a part of the army was near five hours in pa&s;&s;ing Puri&s;burg &s;wamp. The men were always up to the middle, &s;ometimes up to the neck in water. The cold and fatigue were both very great, and a fit of intermitting fever was the con&s;equence in a great number of the &s;oldiers: yet it was only in a few in&s;tances that the di&s;ea&s;e went through a regular cour&s;e, though there was even a general pre-di&s;po&s;ition to it, in the habits of almo&s;t all the men who compo&s;ed the detachment. The mo&s;t of them had &s;uffered from it &s;everely the pre|ceding autumn; and a temporary return of it, was generally ob&s;erved to follow any extraordinary exer|tion, or the application of a debilitating cau&s;e. The above cau&s;es are generally reckoned exciting cau&s;es of fever; but be&s;ides the&s;e there are &s;everal others of con&s;iderable power, which as being commonly known, I &s;hall not now &s;pend time in enumerating. There however &s;till remains one, which, though
<PB N="58" REF="028890_0067_0FDE6848D4544110">
very univer&s;al, and perhaps more powerful than any other, has hitherto been little attended to. The ap|proach to the new and full moon, in &s;ome degree, perhaps in every part of the globe, but particularly in the We&s;t-Indies, appears to be connected with the inva&s;ion and relap&s;e of fevers, in a very remark|able manner. This ob&s;ervation has been hinted ob|&s;curely by one or two authors; the idea has been treated with ridicule by others: and it mu&s;t be con|fe&s;&s;ed, that the facts, which have hitherto been pro|duced in &s;upport of the opinion, are extremely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ague and equivocal. I &s;hall therefore enter a little more minutely into the &s;ubject, and &s;tate circum&s;tantially the evidence, from which I have been led to con&s;i|der the approach to new and full moon, as a power|ful exciting cau&s;e of fever.</P>
<P>That the moon exerts &s;ome influence on the hu|man frame, and that her different appearances are more or le&s;s connected with the progre&s;s and i&s;&s;ue of di&s;ea&s;es, does not &s;eem to have altogether e&s;caped the notice of the ancients. In a fragment of Hippocrates, in the edition of Vander Linden, we find a detail of the different a&s;pects of the moon and planets, with their combined influence on the fate of di&s;ea&s;es; but the &s;tyle and manner of this little tract are &s;o per|plexed, that I do not pretend to under&s;tand its mean|ing. Galen had likewi&s;e &s;ome ob&s;cure ideas on the &s;ubject; but he has left us nothing clear and explicit. The Arabian writers are al&s;o confu&s;ed and inaccu|rate, &s;o that the fir&s;t circum&s;tantial evidence of the influence, or connexion of the moon with the human body, is found in the works of Ballonius, a French phy&s;ician of the &s;ixteenth century. The fact which this author records, though not altogether in point, is curious. A Pari&s;ian lady of quality appears by the account of Ballonius, to have been very &s;ingularly affected during an eclip&s;e of the &s;un. Her complaint threatened nothing dangerous, and her phy&s;icians
<PB N="59" REF="028890_0068_0FDE68774F3C8B10">
were amu&s;ing them&s;elves with ob&s;erving the progre&s;s of the eclip&s;e, when they were &s;uddenly &s;ummoned to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance. In the moment when the eclip&s;e was deepe&s;t, &s;he had the appearance of dying; but the&s;e threatening &s;ymptoms decrea&s;ed with the decrea&s;e of the eclip&s;e; &s;o that &s;he at la&s;t returned to her former &s;tate. This is only a &s;olitary in&s;tance, and perhaps might be reckoned accidental. We may however add to it the general te&s;timony of Ramazzini, who lived at Modena in the beginning of the pre&s;ent cen|tury. This author's ob&s;ervations, indeed, are by no means preci&s;e; yet he was convinced by them, that the cour&s;e of Epidemics was con&s;iderably influenced by the particular &s;tate of the moon. It is almo&s;t needle&s;s to mention Dr. Mead, who wrote a treati&s;e expre&s;sly on the moon's power on the human body. The facts which this writer has collected, afford a rea&s;onable pre&s;umption, that this planet is not with|out &s;ome influence in &s;everal di&s;ea&s;es to which man is liable; but we find not any thing in the work, which particularly relates to fevers. I &s;hall mention a fact recorded by Dr. Grainger. It is the mo&s;t circum|&s;tantial I have yet met with; and the &s;tronge&s;t to be found perhaps in the writings of any European phy|&s;ician. Dr. Grainger, who was a &s;urgeon of the army, &s;erved in the Netherlands about the years 1746 and 47, and wrote a treati&s;e on the intermitting fe|vers of that country. Among other ob&s;ervations he takes notice of a circum&s;tance which occurred to him at that time, and which he then con&s;idered as &s;ingu|larly curious; <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that twenty of the men of the regiment, of which he had the charge, were &s;eized with this fever, which was then epidemic, on the day of a &s;olar eclip&s;e. He has not made any application of the fact. It furni&s;hes however a very &s;ub&s;tantial evi|dence, of the influence or connexion of this planet with the inva&s;ion of febrile di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>It appears to have been long known in India, that
<PB N="60" REF="028890_0069_0FDE6F0ECB10D708">
fevers have a tendency to relap&s;e about the new and full moon, and particularly at the time of eclip&s;es but Dr. Lind of Wind&s;or is the fir&s;t, who brought the knowledge of the fact to Europe. In an inau|gural di&s;&s;ertation, publi&s;hed at Edinburgh (I do not exactly recollect the year), this author ob&s;erves, that this opinion prevailed very generally in the Ea&s;t. He adds likewi&s;e, that &s;ome in&s;tances occurred in his own practice, which gave him cau&s;e to believe that the fact was well founded. Dr. Lind continued of this way of thinking for &s;everal years after his re|turn to England. He does not indeed at pre&s;ent deny the fact. He only &s;ugge&s;ts that it may admit of a different explanation, from that which he had given in his fir&s;t publication. The &s;pring tides, as they overflow the low grounds, according to his pre&s;ent opinion, afford a more probable cau&s;e of the uncom|mon increa&s;e of fevers about the new and full moon, than the direct influence of the planet it&s;elf. I will take the liberty however to add, that this opinion has been offered to the public, from a very imper|fect view of the &s;ubject. I can affirm, even from the confined circle of my own experience, that a connexion, between the moon and the inva&s;ion of fevers, certainly takes place in di&s;tricts remote from the &s;ea; and I believe it is generally known, that a fever, or the paroxy&s;m of fever, is not commonly the in&s;tantaneous con&s;equence of expo&s;ure to its remote cau&s;e; which ought to be the ca&s;e, if this author's rea&s;oning were ju&s;t.</P>
<P>The next, and indeed the only author who has writ|ten profe&s;&s;edly on the influence of the moon in fevers, is Dr. Balfour; a gentleman who re&s;ided &s;everal years in India, and who practi&s;ed with reputation in the &s;ervice of the Company. This author pretends to have inve&s;tigated the &s;ubject with care and attention; but there appears in reality, to be more theory and general a&s;&s;ertion in the treati&s;e than circum&s;tantial
<PB N="61" REF="028890_0070_0FE16FCF0A20A6C0">
fact. The re&s;ult of his ob&s;ervations he informs us, amounts to this: <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that the three days which pre|cede, and the three days which follow new and full moon, are remarkable for the inva&s;ion and relap&s;e of fevers; that the day of the full moon, and the day of the change of the moon, are the mo&s;t remarkable of all: and farther, that the days which follow, are, in general, more remarkable than tho&s;e which precede.</P>
<P>I have now brought together the &s;ub&s;tance of what is found in the writings of tho&s;e authors who have mentioned cur&s;orily, or treated profe&s;&s;edly of this &s;ubject. There is not in any part of it, if we ex|cept the in&s;tance recorded by Dr. Grainger, any thing accurate and preci&s;e enough to enable us to form an opinion. What has fallen under my own ob&s;ervation, I would flatter my&s;elf, is le&s;s ambiguous; and though it may not be &s;o explicit, perhaps, as to e&s;tabli&s;h the doctrine completely, it may at lea&s;t a&s;|&s;i&s;t us, I hope, in approaching nearer to the truth.&mdash;I &s;hall relate it in a few words.</P>
<P>When I arrived in Jamaica, in the year 1774, I had no other knowledge of the influence of the moon in fevers, than what I retained from a cur&s;ory reading of Dr. Lind's di&s;&s;ertation. I remember, however, to have mentioned the circum&s;tance to &s;everal prac|titioners, who had lived many years in the i&s;land. As I conceived there was a &s;imilarity between the cli|mates of Jamiaca and Bengal, I thought it not im|probable, that &s;ome of the practitioners of the coun|try in which I then was, might &s;upply me with &s;atis|factory information on the &s;ubject. There were none of them, however, who acknowledged that they had ever ob&s;erved any connection between the moon and febrile di&s;ea&s;es; neither were there many of them, who &s;eemed di&s;po&s;ed to give credit to its exi&s;tence. Twelve months or more elap&s;ed without my having paid any further regard to the fact, when an acciden|tal
<PB N="62" REF="028890_0071_0FDE78B86164D7E8">
relap&s;e of fever, happening near the time of full moon, recalled Dr. Lind's ob&s;ervation to my me|mory. It likewi&s;e brought to mind a circum&s;tance, which till then I had overlooked. I had &s;een fre|quently, though without attending to it particularly, that three or four of the &s;oldiers of a company of the 60th regiment, who were quartered at Savanna la Mar, and of whom I had the care, were attacked with fever on the &s;ame day; whil&s;t it &s;eldom happened, that any other febrile illne&s;s made its appearance in the garri&s;on, for the en&s;uing fortnight. This having been ob&s;erved oftener than once, at the time the moon was near full, a hint &s;ugge&s;ted it&s;elf, that the cau&s;e, which was &s;aid to influence relap&s;es in India, might here have an effect on the original inva&s;ion. But in order to a&s;certain the truth of this conjecture, which I con&s;idered as a matter of &s;ome importance, I provided my&s;elf with the almanack of the year 1776, and marked, in the blank leaf of it, the preci&s;e date of attack, of all tho&s;e fevers which came under my care. In looking over tho&s;e memoranda at the end of the year, I found I had put down thirty ca&s;es of proper remitting fever, the inva&s;ion of twenty-eight of which was on one or other of the &s;even days, im|mediately preceding new or full moon; that is in the &s;econd and la&s;t quarters. The &s;ame plan of ob&s;er|vation was continued through the following year, and the re&s;ult, though not exactly the &s;ame, was &s;imilar. Of twenty-eight ca&s;es, which where found in the almanack, twenty-two were in the periods above-mentioned: that is in the &s;econd and la&s;t quar|ters of the moon. It de&s;erves however to be re|marked, that three of tho&s;e &s;ix ca&s;es, which were not in the common period of inva&s;ion, happened ac|tually on the day of new moon;&mdash;a few hours after the change had taken place. But be&s;ides tho&s;e ca&s;es of proper remitting fever which I have mentioned,
<PB N="63" REF="028890_0072_0FDE78CECA3528C0">
there were likewi&s;e found in the almanack many days fevers and &s;light feveri&s;h di&s;orders, the inva&s;ion of the greate&s;t number of which was likewi&s;e in the u&s;ual period.</P>
<P>The above is a literal &s;tate of the ca&s;e as it &s;tood in the almanack:&mdash;&s;ome remarks and ob&s;ervations, however, were added, of which the following are the principal: <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> That, though the whole of the &s;e|cond and la&s;t quarters of the moon is included in this period of inva&s;ion; yet the four days immediately preceding new and full moon, were more parti|cularly di&s;tingui&s;hed for tho&s;e febrile attacks: that in the dry &s;ea&s;on, which is reckoned the mo&s;t healthy, the time of inva&s;ion was more clo&s;ely connected with the new and full moon, than in the wet and &s;ickly months, particularly when the &s;ickne&s;s was epidemic, or of a bad kind: and la&s;tly, that this influence, or connexion was more apparent in the &s;oldiers of the garri&s;on, who were expo&s;ed to few occa&s;ions of di&s;|ea&s;e, exce&s;s in drinking excepted, than in the inha|bitants of the town and country, who&s;e occupations carried them oftner to places of unhealthy &s;ituation; or who&s;e modes of life obliged them to &s;ubmit to more various hard&s;hips or to greater fatigues than fell to the lot of a &s;oldier in times of peace.</P>
<P>I &s;hall further beg leave to add, that I went to join the army in America, in the year 1778; and that I continued in that country, the train of ob&s;er|vation on this &s;ubject, which I had begun in the We&s;t Indies. The regiment, in which I &s;erved, was en|camped during the months of June and July on a healthy part of York-i&s;land. Fevers were rare; and the time of inva&s;ion, of &s;uch as did appear, was chiefly confined to the &s;econd and la&s;t quarters of the moon. In the beginning of Augu&s;t, the encampment was removed to King's-bridge, where it occupied a very unhealthy &s;ituation. The intermitting fever &s;oon
<PB N="64" REF="028890_0073_0FDE78EBD9F33810">
made its appearance. It extended in &s;ome degree to the whole battalion; but raged with particular vio|lence on the right, which bordered on low and &s;wampy ground. The approach to new and full moon never failed, even in this climate, to increa&s;e the number of the &s;ick; yet it de&s;erves to be re|marked, that this increa&s;e was always &s;maller in pro|portion, in that part of the battalion, which lay con|tiguous to the &s;wamp, where the di&s;ea&s;e was highly epidemic, than in the other extremity of the encamp|ment, where it prevailed in a le&s;s degree. But &s;till upon the whole, when the regiment moved from their ground, in the beginning of November, of a hundred ca&s;es of intermitting fever, which were marked in the almanack, eighty were found to have commenced in the u&s;ual period of inva&s;ion; that is, in the &s;econd and la&s;t quarters of the moon. It is &s;omewhat remarkable, that relap&s;es were in a &s;maller proportion. This regiment, &s;ome parts of the me|dical hi&s;tory of which I de&s;cribe, embarked on an expedition for the &s;outhward in November, and ar|rived at its de&s;tination in Georgia, in the latter end of the year. It remained in the &s;outhern provinces, and &s;erved every campaign till the capitulation at York-town. The &s;ame train of ob&s;ervation was continued during this intervening &s;pace, and the &s;ame influence of the moon &s;eemed in general to prevail; but the notes having been lo&s;t, I cannot now exactly a&s;certain the degree in which this in|fluence took place. Of this, however, I am certain, that even in times of the greate&s;t epidemic &s;ickne&s;s, when the connexion was evidently weake&s;t, the num|ber of the &s;ick was generally doubled in the periods approaching to new or full moon.</P>
<P>We cannot avoid concluding, from the facts which I have &s;tated above, that the approach to new and full moon, or &s;omething connected with that approach, may be ju&s;tly con&s;idered as a powerful exciting cau&s;e
<PB N="65" REF="028890_0074_0FDE78F178A0F2C0">
of fever. The circum&s;tances, indeed, which I have mentioned, are &s;o clear and unequivocal as to leave little room for doubt: nor did I entertain any, till I found that the ob&s;ervations of Dr. Balfour, on this &s;ubject, were &s;o &s;trikingly different from mine. Ben|gal and Jamaica are di&s;tant from each other; yet few people will be di&s;po&s;ed to believe, that &s;o great mo|dification of a general cau&s;e has ari&s;en &s;olely from this diver&s;ity of climate. Dr. Balfour mu&s;t &s;peak for him&s;elf. For my own part, I can only &s;ay, that what I &s;aw I have related with truth. As I have told the manner in which the idea aro&s;e, with the manner in which the inve&s;tigation was conducted, I leave the conclu&s;ion to be formed by the reader.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. THE PROXIMATE CAUSE OF FEVER.</HEAD>
<P>THEORIES of the proximate cau&s;e of fevers, or more properly modifications of theories, are &s;o numerous, that a whole volume would &s;carcely be &s;ufficient to give any tolerable account of them. It is a ta&s;k indeed which I &s;hall not undertake; yet I hope it will not be altogether &s;uperfluous, to give a cur&s;ory view of the principles, which have directed the conjectures on this &s;ubject in different ages. The principles are, in fact, fewer in number than at fir&s;t &s;ight they appear to be. Phy&s;icians, ambitious of rai&s;ing their name and reputation, have &s;hown great indu&s;try in multiplying and modifying opinions; yet it does not appear, that they have produced any great variety of theories, which are fundamentally di&s;tinct.</P>
<P>The ancients, who were little acquainted with chemical principles, or with the qualities and pro|perties of the nervous &s;y&s;tem, placed the proximate cau&s;e of fevers in &s;ome &s;ignal &s;ymptom of the di&s;|ea&s;e, &s;uch as increa&s;ed heat, or abounding bile; or en|tering &s;till farther into the fields of &s;peculation, ven|tured to attribute it to derangements in the perme|able canals of the body, or to affections of the hu|mours, or circulating ma&s;s of fluids. Hence ob&s;truc|tion of pores, plethora, error loci, lentor and vi&s;cidity, or putrefaction of the humours, have all &s;everally, at different times, or by different authors, been con|&s;idered as the immediate or proximate cau&s;es of this di&s;ea&s;e. The theories, which prevailed in the &s;chools till the beginning of the &s;ixteenth century, did not often extend farther than to the cau&s;es which I have mentioned: but after that period, the di&s;coveries of
<PB N="67" REF="028890_0076_0FDE78FFFB1313D0">
the famous Paracel&s;us opened a road to innovation in medical rea&s;oning. The followers of this author, if not numerous, were enthu&s;ia&s;tic and vociferous. They indulged in the wilde&s;t extravagance of con|jecture; and their opinions, for a con&s;iderable time, were combated with the authority of Galen, rather than with &s;olid argument and accurate rea&s;oning. At la&s;t the di&s;putes between Chemi&s;ts and Galeni&s;ts beginning to &s;ub&s;ide, the chemical theories became incorporated with the doctrines of the mechanic phi|lo&s;ophy, which were revived more than a century ago, and which &s;till maintain &s;ome influence in the common &s;y&s;tems of phy&s;ic. In the mean time hap|pened the important di&s;covery of the circulation of the blood; but no immediate change, in the manner of ac|counting for fevers, en&s;ued immediately in con&s;equence of it. Yet as from this period the re&s;earches of phy|cians began to be conducted on a more extended plan, &s;ome parts of the &s;y&s;tem were brought into view, which had been formerly little attended to. The nervous &s;y&s;tem, which had been in a manner overlooked for many ages, was now found to be of importance in the economy of the animal machine; and authors &s;oon began to con&s;ider it, as affording a probable &s;eat for the proximate cau&s;e of fevers. Among the fir&s;t of tho&s;e authors, who viewed it in this light, we reckon Borelli and Dr. Cole; the one of whom in Italy, the other in England, propo&s;ed much about the &s;ame time, new and different opi|nions about the proximate cau&s;e of fevers. Their conjectures, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, are far from being pro|bable;&mdash;(that of the Italian is &s;carcely ingenious) yet they de&s;erve to be mentioned in this place, as being among the fir&s;t attempts to bring into view a part of the &s;y&s;tem, which is very e&s;&s;ential in enabling us to account for many appearances in febrile di&s;ea&s;es. It is commonly believed, that the nervous &s;y&s;tem was not di&s;covered to be a part of material import|ance;

either in the functions of health, or in the af|fections of &s;ickne&s;s, till the la&s;t century. This, in fact was generally the ca&s;e; yet I mu&s;t not omit to mention, that we meet with an expre&s;&s;ion in the writings of Hippocrates, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <GAP DESC="foreign">, which might incline us to be of opinion that this phy&s;ician was not altogether ignorant of the influence of the nervous power; and that he ac|tually con&s;idered this principle of the con&s;titution to be of much importance in the management and cure of di&s;ea&s;es. After Hippocrates, Van Hel|mont, under the whim&s;ical appellation of Archeus, a&s;&s;erted more directly the dominion of the &s;entient principle. He has indeed applied its operations more particularly to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in explaining the theory of fevers; but it has been a misfortune that the opi|nions of this author have been generally le&s;s attended to, than perhaps they de&s;erve: &s;o that it has been cu&s;tomary to con&s;ider, the celebrated Hoffman as the fir&s;t, who &s;ugge&s;ted the idea, that the proximate cau&s;e of fever depends on a derangement or affection of the nervous &s;y&s;tem; at lea&s;t he is the fir&s;t, who de|livered a &s;y&s;tem on the &s;ubject, which can in any de|gree be con&s;idered as rational and con&s;i&s;tent.</P>
<P>It will not be an ea&s;y ta&s;k, to give a clear and di&s;tinct view of that, which has been con&s;idered by the ancients, as the proximate or immediate cau&s;e of fevers. The language of the earlie&s;t writers is not by any means preci&s;e in this re&s;pect; and we &s;hall frequently, perhaps, have difficulty from the ambi|guity of expre&s;&s;ion, to di&s;tingui&s;h from each other the definition, the remote and occa&s;ional, or the im|mediate and proximate cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e. The proximate cau&s;e of a di&s;ea&s;e, it mu&s;t be remembered, is a cau&s;e which con&s;tantly and uniformly produces its re&s;pective complaint; and without which this complaint cannot even for a moment exi&s;t. It is, in &s;hort, the fir&s;t e&s;&s;ential derangement, which the ac|tion
<PB N="69" REF="028890_0078_0FDE790D507BE4F8">
of this cau&s;e produces in the frame of the &s;uf|ferer: but though we know this to be certainly true, yet we have made no progre&s;s in di&s;covering the na|ture of this derangement. The fir&s;t action of the cau&s;e of fever is ob&s;cure, and &s;ome part of the de|rangement which it occa&s;ions, has hitherto probably pa&s;&s;ed over unnoticed, even by the mo&s;t accurate ob&s;ervers.</P>
<P>If we attempt to give a view of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive conjectures, which, at different times, have been of|fered to the public concerning the proximate cau&s;e of fevers, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to begin with Hippo|crates. We may collect very clearly from the writings of this author, that an increa&s;e of the heat of the body had afforded, to the &s;till more ancient phy&s;icians, the fir&s;t idea of the e&s;&s;ence or immediate cau&s;e of fevers. This &s;eems to have been the idea of the mo&s;t ancient profe&s;&s;ors of medicine. Hippo|crates in &s;ome degree &s;ub&s;cribed to it; yet this author &s;eems likewi&s;e to doubt, if the &s;imple increa&s;e of heat alone is &s;ufficient to con&s;titute a proper fever, or that it can with propriety be con&s;idered as the e&s;|&s;ential proximate cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e. But though Hippocrates rai&s;es this objection to the common opi|nion concerning heat, yet he &s;till leaves us in doubt with regard to the opinion which we ought to adopt. His ideas are fluctuating and uncertain. We find in the different parts of his works, ob&s;truction, ple|thora, mia&s;mata or bile, all &s;eparately con&s;idered, as immediate cau&s;es of fever. But &s;uch cau&s;es, I may add, where they do take place, are in fact only more remote or di&s;tant cau&s;es. Neither mia&s;mata, bile, nor ob&s;truction, are circum&s;tances on which the ex|i&s;tence of fever invariably and nece&s;&s;arily depends; at lea&s;t &s;uch cau&s;es require to be in a certain &s;tate of modification, which is yet undefined, before they are capable of actually producing the di&s;ea&s;e. Bile bears a very con&s;picuous part in the Hippocratic
<PB N="70" REF="028890_0079_0FDE791389233008">
doctrine of fevers. The fabric, indeed, which our author rai&s;es on this principle, is fanciful, and in many re&s;pects, ill founded; yet, as modified by the fertile genius of Galen, it pa&s;&s;ed on through a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of many ages: nor is it, even now, altogether bani&s;hed from the language of practitioners.</P>
<P>Such are the hints concerning the cau&s;es of fevers, which I have been able to collect from the writings of Hippocrates. The expre&s;&s;ions are often ob&s;cure or equivocal; and we can &s;carcely &s;ay, that an opi|nion can be formed from them which de&s;erves the name of a theory. The &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of this great phy|&s;ician were, perhaps, too &s;en&s;ible of this defect; and therefore attempted to fabricate other opinions, which might be more explicit and di&s;tinct. Among the fir&s;t of tho&s;e attempts, we may reckon the hypothe&s;is of Diocles of Cary&s;tus, a phy&s;ician who lived at an early period, and who was highly e&s;teemed by his contemporaries. Fever, according to this author, is not &s;o much a primary di&s;ea&s;e, as a &s;ymptom of &s;ome other affection. Wounds, tumours, and many other accidental cau&s;es, have certainly been ob&s;erved to give ri&s;e to &s;ymptoms which have been u&s;ually deno|minated fever; yet neither wounds nor inflammations have been generally ob&s;erved to give ri&s;e to a proper fever. I will not however deny, that wounds, or in|flammations, occa&s;ionally prove exciting cau&s;es of proper fever, where there is a &s;trong di&s;po&s;ition <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the di&s;ea&s;e, exi&s;ting in the con&s;titution, at the time tho&s;e accidents have happened. It does not appear that this theory of Diocles gained much ground with &s;ucceeding writers; yet it was, perhaps, the cau&s;e of introducing the di&s;tinction of primary and &s;ymptomatic into the hi&s;tory of fevers; a di&s;tinction, which is frequently of con&s;equence in practice. But I mu&s;t further add, that though the opinion of Di|ocles is not admi&s;&s;ible in its literal meaning; yet, in a modified &s;en&s;e, it is not altogether without foundation.
<PB N="71" REF="028890_0080_0FDE791AA9855560">
The &s;ymptoms of fevers are undoubtedly indications of a derangement of the body from its healthy &s;tate; but when we have &s;aid this, we can &s;ay no more.&mdash;The nature of the derangement, which in its fir&s;t beginnings is not obvious to the &s;en&s;es, neither the ancients, nor the writers of the pre&s;ent age have, as yet, been able to a&s;certain.</P>
<P>Not very long after Diocles, Era&s;i&s;tratus, a native of the i&s;land of Cea, and phy&s;ician at the court of An|tigonus, furni&s;hed a conjecture concerning the cau&s;e of fevers, which is mentioned both by Cel&s;us and Galen, and which appears to have originated in his anatomical re&s;earches. As Era&s;i&s;tratus directed his pur&s;uits particularly to the &s;anguiferous &s;y&s;tem: &s;o impre&s;&s;ed, perhaps, with an idea of the importance of that part of the body on which his thoughts had been chiefly employed, he ventures to hazard the opinion, That the immediate cau&s;e of fever depends on a certain error loci, or transfu&s;ion of the red blood into the arterial channels: and this, he moreover adds, proceeds from repletion,&mdash;The opinion originates from an anatomical error, and on that account need not detain us any longer.</P>
<P>The next author, of who&s;e opinion on this &s;ubject any di&s;tinct traces have been tran&s;mitted to us, is A&s;|clepiades, the Bythinian, a man who &s;eldom treats the doctrines of his predece&s;&s;ors with re&s;pect. In his rage for innovation, A&s;clepiades attempted to change or modify the theories of tho&s;e who had gone before him, in &s;uch manner, as to hope to impo&s;e a conjec|ture on the world, which might, at lea&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ome exterior claims of novelty. He allows with the mo&s;t ancient phy&s;icians, that the in&s;eparable &s;ign of fever, or its e&s;&s;ential part, con&s;i&s;ts in an exce&s;s of heat; but having adopted the doctrine of atoms, which was conveyed to the Greeks by Democritus of Abdera, he pretends to account for the difference of types by a difference in the &s;ize of the corpu&s;cles, which he
<PB N="72" REF="028890_0081_0FDE791F8CC7A6F8">
&s;uppo&s;es to be formed by a combination of indivi&s;ible atoms. Thus we &s;ee that ob&s;truction in the per|meable canals of the body, in this writer's opinion, con&s;titutes the theory of the proximate cau&s;e of fever: on which principle we may likewi&s;e conclude, that the modern doctrine of lentor and vi&s;cidity has built its foundation.</P>
<P>The author, whom I have la&s;t mentioned, may actually be con&s;idered as the original founder of the methodic &s;ect. The principal tenets of this &s;ect of phy&s;icians have been tran&s;mitted to us by Cel&s;us, Caelius Aurelianus, or Galen; but the doctrines, which they promulgated, have not been very fully and perfectly explained. The great divi&s;ion of Themi|&s;on, into &s;trictum et laxum, furni&s;hes a very &s;imple view of di&s;ea&s;es. Fevers are included in the fir&s;t or|der of derangement; and in this re&s;pect, may be con&s;idered as depending on a cau&s;e &s;imilar to the ob|&s;truction ob&s;curely hinted by Hippocrates, or more explicitly de&s;cribed by A&s;clepiades. There is this difference, however, between the&s;e re&s;pective opini|ons, that the earlie&s;t writers &s;eem to have referred the ob&s;truction to &s;ome change in the humours or circu|lating ma&s;s; while the <HI>methodics</HI> appear to have attri|buted it more directly, to a change in the capacity of the containing ve&s;&s;els. Hence we may infer, with|out any improper latitude of interpretation, that the &s;trictum of Themi&s;on and The&s;&s;alus comprehends the &s;pa&s;modic con&s;truction of capillaries, which has lately made &s;o con&s;picuous a part in the theory of febrile di&s;ea&s;es. This theory of the methodics, where the nervous and fibrous &s;y&s;tem have been more regarded than the humours, or circulating ma&s;s of fluids, was principally followed at Rome, for more than a hun|dred years. At la&s;t Galen, who was a very unqua|lified admirer of Hippocrates, exerted him&s;elf &s;o &s;uc|ce&s;sfully in reviving the humoral doctrine of his ma&s;|ter, that the methodic &s;ect began to &s;ink rapidly into
<PB N="73" REF="028890_0082_0FDE7925B56357D8">
decay; and after a &s;hort time its traces were totally obliterated.</P>
<P>The frequent blanks, in medical hi&s;tory, make it no ea&s;y ta&s;k to give a connected view of the fluctuat|ing &s;y&s;tems of the ancient phy&s;icians. The works of every writer of the methodic &s;ect have peri&s;hed, ex|cept tho&s;e of Caelius Aurelianus: neither have we been able to di&s;cover any new opinion, or modifica|tion of opinion, concerning the proximate cau&s;e of fevers, between the time of A&s;clepiades or Themi|&s;on, and the great commentator of Hippocrates, ex|cept that of Athenaeus. Athenaeus, who was the head of the &s;ect of Pneumatics, &s;tood high in e&s;teem among his contemporaries and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. This au|thor ventured to &s;ugge&s;t a new hypothe&s;is, or more properly perhaps, only extended, and more fully ex|plained a doctrine, of which the ob&s;cure traces may be di&s;covered at an earlier date. The general cau&s;e of fever, in this writer's opinion, con&s;i&s;ts in a putrefaction, or putre&s;cent &s;tate of the humours. Hip|pocrates &s;eems to have entertained &s;ome indi&s;tinct idea of the &s;ame kind; and tho&s;e, who have been inclined to this way of thinking, both in ancient and in mo|dern times, have neither been few in numbers, nor contemptible in authority.</P>
<P>Galen, who has written on mo&s;t parts of me|dical &s;cience more learnedly than his predece&s;&s;ors, has di&s;cu&s;&s;ed very fully the &s;ubject of the proximate cau&s;e of fevers. Amid&s;t the luxuriance of this author's co|louring, it is &s;ometimes difficult to lay hold of the preci&s;e idea; at the &s;ame time, that it is oftener tedi|ous than in&s;tructing to follow him through the maze of his fanciful and inconclu&s;ive rea&s;onings. I &s;hall not therefore enter into a minute detail of his argu|ments; but &s;till I conceive it may be u&s;eful, particu|larly to tho&s;e who have not the opportunity of con|&s;ulting his voluminous, and in &s;ome re&s;pects ill dige&s;t|ed works, if I compre&s;s into narrow compa&s;s the lead|ing
<PB N="74" REF="028890_0083_0FDE792A511DF928">
principles of his general doctrines. In the fir&s;t place, the opinion, hinted by Hippocrates and adopted by mo&s;t of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, that the e&s;&s;ence of fever con|&s;i&s;ts in a certain derangement of heat, is expre&s;sly maintained by Galen, who explains more elaborately than his predece&s;&s;ors the various circum&s;tances, which influence or modify this general cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e. Galen a&s;&s;umes, indeed, as a fundamental po&s;ition, that heat any how, or any where excited, communi|cated to the heart, and from the heart to the re&s;t of the body, con&s;titutes a fever; yet he afterwards adds more explicitly, that a preternatural heat does not con&s;titute a fever, unle&s;s it is communicated to the heart; which is con&s;equently to be con&s;idered as the principal &s;eat and re&s;idence of the febrile affection. Having, as he imagines, e&s;tabli&s;hed this fundamental principle, he proceeds to inve&s;tigate, more particu|larly, the parts of the body where the heat re&s;ides, and the cau&s;es by which it is generated, propagated, or &s;o modified, as to produce the di&s;ea&s;e in its differ|ent forms. But, that he may the better explain his meaning clearly, he divides fevers into three differ|ent kinds: <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the hectic, or habitual, the humoural, and the ephemeral. The fir&s;t he &s;uppo&s;es to ari&s;e from an affection of the &s;olids, or containing parts; the &s;econd from &s;ome derangement of the fluids, or contained parts; and the third from &s;ome di&s;turbance of the &s;pirits, or that part of the frame which we, per|haps, now di&s;tingui&s;h by the name of nervous &s;y&s;|tem. He adds in the next place, that putrefaction is the medium, by which fever is excited, where the fluids or humours are the &s;ubject of the di&s;ea&s;e, con|tiguity and continuity, where the illne&s;s affects the habit or &s;olid parts; and where the effects are tran&s;i|tory and fleeting, he attributes the cau&s;e principally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o the rapid movements of the &s;pirits, or nervous in|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">uence. And la&s;tly, he attempts to complete his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ory, by explaining the different types of humoural
<PB N="75" REF="028890_0084_0FDE792FEF00DA28">
fevers, on the &s;uppo&s;ition of a &s;tate of putrefaction in the different humours, from which he &s;uppo&s;es the di&s;ea&s;e to ari&s;e. On this &s;ubject he has deviated very materially from his ma&s;ter Hippocrates, though he probably drew his ideas from the hints, which are found in that author's works. Hippocrates explains, or attempts to explain the various types of fevers, by a &s;imple difference in the quantity of the bile. Ga|len, on the contrary, as we have &s;aid ju&s;t now, en|deavours to account for this phenomenon, by a &s;up|po&s;ition of putrefaction in the phlegmatic and bilious humours, which bear &s;o con&s;picuous a part in his theo|retical &s;y&s;tem. Thus Galen &s;uppo&s;es, that a putre&s;|cent tendency in the blood gives ri&s;e to a continued fever; a &s;imilar di&s;po&s;ition in the phlegm di&s;po&s;es the di&s;ea&s;e to appear in a quotidian form: putrefaction of the yellow bile determines the type to be of the ter|tian kind; whil&s;t a like tendency, in the black bile, regulates the movements of the quartan period.&mdash;It is unnece&s;&s;ary to make any remarks on the ba&s;ele&s;s fabric, which this author has offered to the world, concerning the proximate cau&s;e of fevers.&mdash;Its in|con&s;i&s;tency and in&s;ufficiency are perfectly obvious.</P>
<P>After the time of Galen there does not appear to have been any material change, in the manner of ac|counting for fevers, for many ages. Aetius Amidenus indeed &s;ugge&s;ted &s;ome re&s;trictions and explanations in certain &s;pecies of fever, which do not &s;eem to have been &s;o explicitly marked by the commentator of Hippocrates. In&s;tead of con&s;idering putrefaction as the &s;ole means of exciting heat in every &s;pecies of humoural fever, Aetius ventures to in&s;inuate, that there is no &s;tate of actual putrefaction in the <GAP DESC="foreign">, or that &s;pecies of di&s;ea&s;e which is purely inflammato|ry, the cau&s;e of which appears to be &s;imply an inor|dinate fermentation or ebullition of the blood. But except in this in&s;tance, the &s;ucceeding Greek phy&s;i|cians do not &s;eem to have departed, in the lea&s;t, from
<PB N="76" REF="028890_0085_0FDE792FEF00DA28">
the direct foot&s;teps of Galen. The Arabians likewi&s;e, among the principal of whom we may reckon Avi|cenna, adopted his general doctrines, and modes of rea&s;oning, only Avicenna defines more expre&s;sly than others had done before him, that fevers of all deno|minations ari&s;e immediately from a preternatural heat of the heart; in doing which, he &s;eems to have ex|tended the influence and power of that quality which preceding authors in loo&s;er terms had con&s;idered as the general cau&s;e of febrile di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>The doctrines of Galen, with &s;ome immaterial in|novations of the Arabian phy&s;icians, wholly occu|pied the &s;chools of medicine, till the beginning of the &s;ixteenth century, about which time Aureolus Phi|lippus Theophra&s;tus, commonly known by the name of Paracel&s;us, effected a revolution of opinions, which marks an important period in the hi&s;tory of the medical art. Paracel&s;us, who was a man of a &s;ingular turn of mind, &s;pent the earlier part of his life in travelling among the nations of A&s;ia; where he probably acquired &s;ome knowledge of chemi&s;try, in which &s;cience the Arabians appear, even at that time, to have made con&s;iderable progre&s;s. The knowledge, which Paracel&s;us carried home to his native country, was not generally known in Europe. This author applied it with &s;ucce&s;s in the cure of &s;ome de&s;perate di&s;ea&s;es; and acquired uncommon fame from his new and unheard-of remedies. He was an empiric in the theory, no le&s;s than in the practice of the art; and I may add, that his attempts to overturn the doctrines of the ancients, give an in|dication of more effrontery than genius or know|ledge. The wonderful cures of ob&s;tinate di&s;ea&s;es, which he was &s;aid to perform; and &s;till more, perhaps, the my&s;teriou&s;ne&s;s of his language, which caught the notice of the vulgar, who often imagine that know|ledge is concealed under terms, which they do not under&s;tand, brought followers to his &s;tandard. Theo|ries

of the proximate cau&s;e of fevers, were fabricated without difficulty, by the help of tho&s;e principles, which Paracel&s;us had introduced to the acquaintance of the world; yet it does not appear, that any theory aro&s;e, during this period, which had probability, or even ingenuity for its &s;upport. The period indeed, during which chemical rea&s;onings &s;o univer&s;ally pre|vailed, may be &s;tyled ju&s;tly enough a period of me|dical romance: and I &s;hould con&s;ider it as a tre&s;pa&s;s on the patience and good &s;en&s;e of the reader, to &s;pend time in refuting the ab&s;urd and incongruous doctrines of &s;ulphur, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">itre or mercury; acid and alkali, or the various modes of fermentations, which for a time filled the writings of phy&s;icians. The mechanical mode of rea&s;oning, which &s;ucceeded, or rather which became incorporated with the doctrines of the che|mi&s;ts, &s;eemed at fir&s;t to promi&s;e greater advantages: but though theories of fevers were formed by many eminent men, both of the la&s;t and pre&s;ent century, on the principles of the mechanical or chemico-me|chanical philo&s;ophy; yet there are not any of them, which &s;eem to have afforded a &s;atisfactory explana|tion of the &s;ubject.&mdash;The &s;o-much celebrated doctrine of lentor and vi&s;cidity was a&s;&s;umed without evidence of its exi&s;tence, and per&s;i&s;ted in, without being &s;uf|ficient to account for the phenomena of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e conjectures concerning the proximate cau&s;e of fevers, which I have mentioned hitherto, can &s;el|dom be &s;aid to extend farther than to a particular &s;tate of the humours, or circulating ma&s;s of fluids, which, according to the prevailing philo&s;ophy of dif|ferent ages, have been &s;uppo&s;ed to be changed from their natural and healthy &s;tate, by chemical or me|chanical derangement. I ob&s;erved before, that it might appear, from an accidental expre&s;&s;ion in the writings of Hippocrates, that this author was not altogether ignorant of the influence or effects of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">vous power, or &s;entient principle. The methodic

&s;ect likewi&s;e, may &s;eem to have comprehended in the idea which they have given of di&s;ea&s;es, that there is &s;ome derangement of the fibrous &s;y&s;tem; or perhaps that a &s;pa&s;modic &s;tricture of capillaries is actually the immediate cau&s;e of fever; whil&s;t Galen every where celebrates the powers of nature or vires naturae me|dicatrices, which bear in his opinion, a very active part in the cure of febrile di&s;ea&s;es. To tho&s;e vague ideas of the ancients, we may add the more modern and explicit doctrine of Van Helmont, who was a man of genius, learning and ob&s;ervation. Van Hel|mont adopted the &s;entient principle of Hippocrates; but he al&s;o applied it in a bolder light than had been done by its original author, and employed its a&s;&s;ertions more particularly towards the explanation of the cau&s;e and phenomena of fevers. The enthu&s;ia&s;m of this writer di&s;gu&s;ts the philo&s;ophic &s;pirit of the pre|&s;ent age, and we mu&s;t acknowledge, that his ideas are often unphilo&s;ophical and ab&s;urd; yet we mu&s;t likewi&s;e do him the ju&s;tice to add, that the principle of his doctrine in &s;ome degree is well founded, and that his views, in many re&s;pects, are important in practice. I mu&s;t further ob&s;erve, that the efforts of nature, &s;o celebrated by Campanella and Sydenham, and even, perhaps, the <GAP DESC="foreign">, of Stahl and his followers, can only be con&s;idered as modifications of the furious Archeus.&mdash;But though the authors I have mentioned, &s;eem evidently to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ome vague idea of the powers or influence of the nervous &s;y&s;tem; yet there are not any of them, who have at|tempted to explain its operations by a philo&s;ophical and con&s;i&s;tent mode of rea&s;oning. The period of this improvement is not very remote.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the circulation of the blood was known and fully e&s;tabli&s;hed, the heart lo&s;t &s;ome part of its former importance; whil&s;t the brain and nerves, which for many ages had been little regarded, ro&s;e into primary and e&s;&s;ential con&s;equence. But

though the brain and nerves were di&s;covered, &s;oon after this period, to be the in&s;truments of life and motion; yet the laws of this part of the &s;y&s;tem were at fir&s;t only imperfectly under&s;tood; and the attempts to explain its operations were, for a while, whim&s;ical and ab&s;urd. Willis de&s;erves &s;ome credit, as being one of the fir&s;t who brought the general importance of the nervous &s;y&s;tem into view: but Borelli, an Italian mathematician, actually appears to be the fir&s;t who ventured to a&s;cribe the proximate cau&s;e of fever, to a particular derangement of this part of the frame. The immediate cau&s;e of fever, in this author's opinion, depends on &s;ome unu&s;ual acrimony of the nervous fluid; but it is only nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve with regard to this doctrine, that a &s;uppo&s;ition of acrimonious fluids, where a fluid cannot be proved to exi&s;t, is &s;o perfectly vi&s;ionary, as only to de&s;erve to be mentioned, from its being the fir&s;t attempt to bring this part into view, in accounting for febrile di&s;ea&s;e. This hypothe&s;is, however, though obviou&s;ly ill founded, enjoyed its day of fame. It was &s;oon followed by another conjecture, more ingenious in|deed, but which was not &s;o generally attended to, as the preceding. Dr. Cole of Worce&s;ter, towards the end of la&s;t century, &s;ugge&s;ted an idea, that the proximate cau&s;e of intermitting fevers depends on a laxity or debility of the brain and origin of the nerves. The &s;uppo&s;ition is not &s;o improbable; but the &s;uper|&s;tructure, which the author has rai&s;ed, is ab&s;urd, and un&s;upported either by fact or probability. Yet, if we expect Mundy, an author who offered a conjec|ture of a &s;imilar kind, in a work entitled <GAP DESC="foreign">, Borelli and Cole are the only writers prior to the time of Hoffman, who con&s;idered the nervous &s;y&s;tem, as directly affording a &s;eat for the proximate cau&s;e of fevers. Hoffman, whom I have ju&s;t mentioned, was a celebrated profe&s;&s;or at Halle in Saxony. He flouri&s;hed in the earlier part of the pre&s;ent century,
<PB N="80" REF="028890_0089_0FDE794A411FD398">
publi&s;hed many volumes, and certainly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the merit of having enlarged our views on the &s;ubject of fevers. His theory of the proximate cau&s;e is not only more ingenious, but certainly has more appear|ance of truth, than any other, which had been offered to the public at the time it appeared. The cure of fever con&s;i&s;ts, in his opinion, in a &s;pa&s;modic affection of the nervous &s;y&s;tem. It is a truth which few people will attempt to deny, that a &s;pa&s;modic &s;tricture of the &s;urface of the body generally takes place in ordinary ca&s;es of fever; yet we mu&s;t perhaps al&s;o acknowledge with Dr. Cullen, that a &s;pa&s;modic &s;tricture is not certainly and uniformly the fir&s;t e&s;|&s;ential part of a febrile di&s;ea&s;e. Some other thing is frequently ob&s;erved to precede the &s;pa&s;m, which, in the opinion of the la&s;t mentioned celebrated profe&s;&s;or, has a right to be con&s;idered as a proximate and e&s;&s;en|tial cau&s;e. But as the theory of the proximate cau&s;e, a&s;&s;igned by Dr. Cullen, is not only more plau&s;ible and complete than any preceding one; but &s;till in|crea&s;ing in popularity and fame, it will not be &s;uper|fluous, if we &s;top to examine it with more attention. The remote cau&s;es of fever, according to this author, are &s;edative powers, applied to the nervous &s;y&s;tem, which dimini&s;hing the energy of the brain, thereby produce a debility in the whole of the functions, and particularly in the action of the extreme ve&s;&s;els. Such, however, is at the &s;ame time the nature of the animal economy, that this debility proves an indirect &s;timulus to the &s;anguiferous &s;y&s;tem; whence by the intervention of the cold &s;tage and &s;pa&s;m connected with it, the action of the heart and larger arteries is increa&s;ed, and continues to be &s;o, till it has had the effect of re&s;toring the energy of the brain, of exciting this energy to the extreme ve&s;&s;els, of re&s;toring there|fore their action; and thereby &s;pecially overcoming the &s;pa&s;m affecting them: upon the removing of which, the excretion of &s;weat, and other marks of
<PB N="81" REF="028890_0090_0FDE794F48FA9D50">
relaxation of excretories take place. This theory of fever holds out an appearance of great &s;implicity, and of perfect connexion. I wi&s;h we could &s;ay that it had an equal claim to truth: but I am afraid it will be found, on a careful examination, to be no more in reality than an ingenious hypothe&s;is, the leading prin|ciples of which can &s;carcely be proved even to exi&s;t. I do not pretend to enter deeply into the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the &s;ubject; yet I cannot avoid repre&s;enting, in a few words, &s;ome circum&s;tances of difficulty in this au|thor's theory, which are not ea&s;ily reconcileable, either with rea&s;on or ob&s;ervation. It might be doubt|ed, in the fir&s;t place, if the remote cau&s;es of fever are actually of a &s;imple &s;edative nature; but at pre|&s;ent I &s;hall admit that the fir&s;t principle, which is a&s;|&s;umed by the profe&s;&s;or, is in reality a fact, and pro|ceed to enquire, if the re&s;t of the doctrine is capable of being defended, even on this foundation. It con&s;ti|tutes the &s;um of Dr. Cullen's theory, as was men|tioned before, that the remote cau&s;es of fever occa|&s;ion debility, or dimini&s;hed energy of the brain and nervous &s;y&s;tem; that this debility nece&s;&s;arily gives ri&s;e to &s;pa&s;m, and increa&s;ed action of the heart and arteries; which continuing for a certain length of time, finally removes the di&s;ea&s;e. Thus the different &s;tages of fever appear to follow each other as cau&s;e and effect; and debility in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, is &s;up|po&s;ed nece&s;&s;arily to give ri&s;e to reaction. Such a &s;up|po&s;ition is not very obvious to rea&s;on, and has not much &s;upport from the analogy of facts. It would be ea&s;y to mention examples, where the application of debilitating cau&s;es as is not ob&s;erved to be follow|ed by obvious reaction of the &s;y&s;tem; but at pre&s;ent I &s;hall content my&s;elf with the familiar one of the ap|plication of cold. It is perfectly well known, that cold, when con&s;tantly and uniformly applied to the body, even goes &s;o far as ab&s;olutely to extingui&s;h the powers of life, in a part, or in the whole, without
<PB N="82" REF="028890_0091_0FDE7954B24212D8">
our being able to perceive any efforts on the part of nature to &s;top the progre&s;s of this de&s;tructive tenden|cy. From this we may fairly infer, that common de|bilitating cau&s;es, at lea&s;t while they continue to be applied in the &s;ame con&s;tant and uniform manner, do not nece&s;&s;arily excite the reaction of the &s;y&s;tem: but I will even go farther, and venture to affirm, that &s;pa&s;m and reaction do not nece&s;&s;arily follow very great degrees of debility, which appear to proceed from the pre&s;ence of a febrile cau&s;e. During the time I re|mained in America, I had frequent opportunities of witne&s;&s;ing the truth of this a&s;&s;ertion. In the &s;outhern provinces of that country, particularly in the &s;ummer and autumnal months, the intermitting fever was ge|nerally epidemic in a high degree; but its general cau&s;e, which was then &s;o abounding in the atmo&s;phere, often injured the actions of life, without producing a regular train of operation; that is, one part of the di&s;ea&s;e appeared without that mode of action, which is &s;uppo&s;ed, by our author, to be its nece&s;&s;ary effect. Thus, I have &s;een the mo&s;t extreme degrees of de|bility, and langour in all the functions, continue even for eight or ten days, without our being able to di&s;|cover the &s;malle&s;t marks of &s;pa&s;m, or obvious reac|tion. This inactivity and langour &s;ometimes vani&s;h|ed &s;uddenly; and the body re&s;umed its ordinary health and vigour, frequently without an evident cau&s;e. On the next day, however, or perhaps the day following it, the patient was &s;urprized with a re|gular paroxy&s;m of fever. From this it appears very plainly, that if the immediate cau&s;e of fever actually con&s;i&s;ts in debility, this debility nece&s;&s;arily undergoes a peculiar, but hitherto undefined &s;pecies of modifi|cation, before it can be con&s;idered as the cau&s;e of the &s;ub&s;equent parts of the di&s;ea&s;e; a conce&s;&s;ion which leaves us perfectly in our former &s;tate of uncertainty and ignorance.</P>
<P>As it may be concluded from the facts, which I
<PB N="83" REF="028890_0092_0FDE795A98DB4800">
have mentioned, that &s;pa&s;m and reaction are not the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equences of the application of debilitat|ing cau&s;es, either common or febrile; &s;o if we pur&s;ue our author's train of rea&s;oning farther, we &s;hall not find his inductions to be very con&s;i&s;tent, or very con|vincing. If we are di&s;po&s;ed to grant, that the re|mote cau&s;es of fever actually dimini&s;h the energy of the brain, it is not an obvious inference, that the circum&s;tances of this dimini&s;hed energy have the cer|tain effect of exciting the reaction of the &s;y&s;tem. It appears, in &s;hort, like a&s;cribing re&s;t and motion to the &s;ame power. But to &s;mooth the prominent fea|tures of this apparent incon&s;i&s;tency, the ingenious author has thought fit to a&s;&s;ume a principle, the ex|i&s;tence of which is very ambiguous in its enlarged &s;en&s;e, and very in&s;ufficient in its limited one. Dr. Cullen does not admit of the Italian principle of <GAP DESC="foreign">; he however a&s;cribes effects to the vis na|turae medicatrix, which are not capable of being ex|plained mechanically. I mentioned before, that no efforts of nature are perceived to ari&s;e, under the uniform and con&s;tant application of a debilitating cau&s;e; but though this is true, I mu&s;t likewi&s;e ob|&s;erve, that when the&s;e debilitating powers, from any cau&s;e whatever, actually cea&s;e to act, abate materi|ally in the inten&s;ity of their action, or &s;uffer change in its mode, before the vital principle is irrecoverably de&s;troyed, nature, which per&s;i&s;ts in continuing life, and even &s;truggles in attempting to maintain it, may then be &s;aid to rai&s;e efforts, which have a tendency to re&s;tore the body to its ordinary health. This power, which to a certain degree, re&s;i&s;ts cau&s;es of a de&s;tructive tendency and which endeavours to re&s;|tore to their original &s;tate the derangements of the &s;y&s;tem whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">h have actually taken place, is only a li|mited degree of the vis naturae medicatrix. It is in &s;hort, no more than an effort to continue the action of living; yet it is all, which we &s;hall, at any time, perhaps, be able to perceive.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="028890_0093_0FDE795FD550A270">
I have thus mentioned briefly &s;ome objections, to this celebrated theory of Dr. Cullen. The inge|nuity of the author is acknowledged to be great; the pains and labour, which he h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> be&s;towed in complet|ing his favourite doctrine appear likewi&s;e to be con|&s;iderable; yet I cannot help remarking, that its de|fects are &s;till &s;o obvious, that we are unavoidably obliged to be &s;atisfied with one of the&s;e conclu&s;ions: <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> either that the debility, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the cau&s;e of fever, is of a peculiar but unknown kind; that it cea&s;es to act, or changes its mode of action from an accidental cau&s;e, or from &s;omething in its own nature; or that a reaction ari&s;es in the &s;y&s;tem, from a principle of con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the de&s;tructive tendency of this debilitating power. It is not con|&s;onant with the common laws of the animal economy; that reaction &s;hould ari&s;e in that part of the &s;y&s;tem, where the debilitating influence has been primarily and principally exerted. Suppo&s;itions of this nature, are only &s;ubterfuges, and no more in reality than my&s;terious ways of acknowledging ignorance.</P>
<P>The opinions I have enumerated above are the principal ones, which have been advanced by medical writers, on the &s;ubject of the proxi|mate cau&s;e of fevers. Though numerous, they are all reducible to two general cla&s;&s;es; <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> either to conjectures, which are totally without foundation; or to circum&s;tances, which are in fact only &s;ymptoms or parts of the di&s;ea&s;e, &s;ome of which are more, others le&s;s e&s;&s;ential. The proximate cau&s;e of fever, is a cer|tain peculiar &s;tate of the body, on which the di&s;ea&s;e, or the &s;ub&s;equent parts of the di&s;ea&s;e, nece&s;&s;arily de|pend. It is, in &s;hort, the fir&s;t e&s;&s;ential action of the febrile cau&s;e; but this action is &s;o intricate and diffi|cult to be di&s;covered, that phy&s;icians have fought for it in vain for more than two thou&s;and years. The ancients were &s;atisfied with the idea of preternatural heat, excited in the heart, and communicated, by
<PB N="85" REF="028890_0094_0FDE79644EDED2E0">
means of the blood and &s;pirits, to the re&s;t of the body. Hoffman, making a bolder &s;tep, introduces a &s;pa&s;modic affection of the moving fibres; and Dr. Cullen, go|ing &s;till farther, lays the principal &s;tre&s;s upon lan|guor and debility, or weakened action of the nervous energy. Increa&s;ed heat, &s;pa&s;modic &s;tricture and marks of debility, are generally pre&s;ent, in various degrees, in the different &s;tages of fever; but debility for the mo&s;t part precedes the others; and on this account, if equal|ly e&s;&s;ential, has a preferable right to be con&s;idered as the fir&s;t part of the di&s;ea&s;e. There is &s;till rea&s;on to doubt if it actually is the fir&s;t. I have my&s;elf at|tended carefully to the manner in which intermitting fevers approach. The fir&s;t thing which I ob&s;erved in others, or what is &s;till more to be depended upon, the fir&s;t thing I felt in my&s;elf, was u&s;ually a di&s;agree|able, but a peculiar affection of the &s;tomach. The preci&s;e nature of this affection I am unable to define in words; but I knew it &s;o well by experience, that I always con&s;idered it as a warning, (and it was &s;ometimes the only warning, which I had,) of the approach of the paroxy&s;m. It was often accompa|nied by flatulence, and it &s;ometimes preceded the fir&s;t feelings of the languor and debility, nearly the &s;pace of an hour. The ob&s;ervation of this fact has occured to me frequently; and I cannot avoid con|cluding, that it gives room to believe, that the de|bility, which is &s;o commonly the fore-runner of fever, in&s;tead of being the fir&s;t and principal mode of ac|tion of the febrile cau&s;e, is only a part of that action,&mdash;perhaps not the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential. As Hippocrates appears at a very early period to have been perfectly &s;en&s;ible, that &s;omething be&s;ides a &s;imple increa&s;e of heat was nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute a fever; &s;o we may now perhaps conclude, with equal rea&s;on, that debi|lity has &s;ome other circum&s;tances combined with it, which we have not been able to di&s;cern very clearly.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="028890_0095_0FDE7969F5297388">
Having &s;aid that there are not any of the numerous theories, which have as yet been offered to the public on this important &s;ubject, in any degree &s;atisfactory, it might be expected, perhaps, that I had &s;omething of my own to bring forward, which might be more perfect, at lea&s;t in my own opinion: but I willingly acknowledge, that I have no &s;uch preten&s;ions. After fourteen or fifteen years of careful ob&s;ervation, and daily reflexion on the phenomena of fevers, I am obliged to confe&s;s, that my opinion &s;till remains to be formed. The proximate cau&s;e of this di&s;ea&s;e, is a &s;ubject of a dark nature. It is &s;uch, perhaps, as our limited capacities will never develope. But though we de&s;pair of ever attaining clear ideas of its &s;pecific nature, there are &s;till &s;ome u&s;eful circum|&s;tances connected with it, which we comprehend with clearne&s;s. We know, that the more general remote cau&s;es of fevers, are certain invi&s;ible exhala|tions, &s;ometimes more evidently ari&s;ing from mar&s;hy grounds, &s;ometimes more ob&s;curely diffu&s;ed in the air, and &s;ometimes obviou&s;ly proceeding from the bodies of our fellow creatures. We know, likewi&s;e, that the&s;e cau&s;es which are unfriendly to the human con&s;titution, are variou&s;ly modified and combined, and of various degrees of force or in various &s;tates of concentration; but we proceed no farther with cer|tainty. We are not able to a&s;certain the nature of the&s;e effluvia, and it is only by conjecture that we trace them in the channels by which they enter the body. The changes which they operate on the &s;olids, fluids, or nervous &s;y&s;tem, before their action becomes obvious, are totally unknown to us. We know, though the body lie expo&s;ed to exhalation, even in a concentrated &s;tate, that an appearance of di&s;ea&s;e is not, generally, the in&s;tantaneous con&s;equence. A &s;pace of time intervenes, various indeed according to circum&s;tances, but always &s;uch as gives room to believe, that the cau&s;e requires, and actually under|goes
<PB N="87" REF="028890_0096_0FDE796EEF9F96E0">
a modification, before it is capable of producing a fever, or the paroxy&s;m of a fever. The circum|&s;tances connected with the approach of fevers, parti|cularly intermitting fevers, afford an illu&s;tration of my meaning. The cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, &s;o far from producing the fever immediately when applied to the body, often lurks for a con&s;iderable time in the con|&s;titution, without perceptibly injuring the ordinary actions of life. Sometimes it gives ri&s;e to affections, which are apparently very different from their real nature. Thus a per&s;on often langui&s;hes for days, weeks, or even longer. The indi&s;po&s;ition &s;uddenly and unexpectedly vani&s;hes: and the apparent reco|very of health is &s;oon followed by a paroxy&s;m of re|gular fever. In other ca&s;es again, the attack of the di&s;ea&s;e is &s;udden; and its formation from the begin|ning di&s;tinct. This fact affords a pre&s;umption, that, in con&s;equence of a particular modification, which is only accompli&s;hed in a certain &s;pace of time, but the nature of which we do not in the lea&s;t compre|hend, an aptitude is regenerated between the remote cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, and the relative &s;tate of the body. When the &s;tate of the body, and the remote cau&s;e ap|proach to, or arrive at a &s;tate of mutual corre&s;pon|dence, the di&s;ea&s;e is produced. When this &s;tate, which I call an aptitude, is changed or de&s;troyed, the di&s;ea&s;e vani&s;hes, or &s;uffers a change of form. This is a fact, which cannot be di&s;puted; and it &s;eems to be the extent of our knowledge, on the important &s;ubject of the proximate cau&s;e of fevers.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. OF THE GENERAL HISTORY OF THE FEVER OF JAMAICA.</HEAD>
<P>IT will not be improper to remark, before I begin to de&s;cribe the hi&s;tory of this fever, that though the endemic which prevailed at Savanna la Mar, not|with&s;tanding much variety of forms and &s;ymptoms, is con&s;idered as only one and the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e, yet it may al&s;o be ob&s;erved, that the variety of the&s;e appearances is &s;ometimes &s;o great and remarkable as to occa&s;ion con&s;iderable perplexity to the practitioner. The &s;ymp|toms and form of this endemic appeared, on a &s;uper|ficial view to be con&s;tantly varying; yet by attend|ing more clo&s;ely to the cour&s;e, progre&s;s, and changes of the di&s;ea&s;e, the&s;e apparent irregularities vani&s;hed gradually, the varieties being in fact only accidental, and often depending on very trivial cau&s;es. The ana|ly&s;is of the different ca&s;es of fever, which came under my care, during the time that I lived in Jamaica, furni&s;hed me with this information. I formerly mentioned the manner in which my ob&s;ervations were conducted: I have only now to add, that I tru&s;t the method, which I adopted, has enabled me to give a more accurate hi&s;tory of the fever of Jamaica, and to explain more &s;atisfactorily than has been done hi|therto the various &s;ources of the many irregularities which are ob&s;erved to occur. I am perfectly &s;en&s;ible that my experience has been too limited, to give me hopes of rendering the pre&s;ent work complete; yet I would flatter my&s;elf, that it will not be altogether u&s;ele&s;s: I totally di&s;claim theoretical opinions, and content my&s;elf with a plain narrative of facts; neither do I a&s;pire to any higher prai&s;e, than care in ob&s;erving

the appearances of the di&s;ea&s;e, and truth in relating the appearances which I have &s;een.</P>
<P>Before proceeding to give a particular hi&s;tory of the different varieties of the endemic fever of Jamaica, it will not be improper to mention the more general &s;ymptoms, which di&s;tingui&s;h the di&s;ea&s;e, and to trace an outline of the cour&s;e, which it has been commonly ob&s;erved to pur&s;ue: and I may remark in the fir&s;t place, that though debility is u&s;ually con&s;idered as the fir&s;t &s;ign of an approaching fever; yet, if we attend minutely to all the circum&s;tances of inva&s;ion, it will not generally be difficult to perceive, that a di&s;agree|able, though unde&s;cribable affection of the &s;tomach, takes place previous to the &s;malle&s;t perceptions of languor or debility, which are commonly only imme|diate fore-runners of coldne&s;s and &s;hivering. This coldne&s;s, which was ob&s;erved to be various in dura|tion, as well as in degree of force in the fevers of this country, was &s;ucceeded by flu&s;hings of heat al|ternating with the cold, and increa&s;ing gradually till the heat at la&s;t prevailed. The hot fit, which was likewi&s;e of various duration and of various force, had many new &s;ymptoms joined with it, the principal of which were &s;uch as &s;hewed an increa&s;ed circula|tion, or an irregular determination of the blood to the different parts of the body. This hot fit, and the di&s;turbances connected with it, according to cir|cum&s;tances, continued for a longer or &s;horter &s;pace of time; at la&s;t &s;weat breaking out on the head and brea&s;t, extended it&s;elf gradually to the extremities, and accompli&s;hed after a certain continuance, either a total remi&s;&s;ion of the fever, or a con&s;iderable abate|ment of the violence of the &s;ymptoms. It is almo&s;t unnece&s;&s;ary to mention, that this remi&s;&s;ion or abate|ment of &s;ymptoms was of longer or &s;horter duration, and more or le&s;s complete in fevers of different forms. An aggravation of &s;ymptoms &s;ucceeded to the re|mi&s;&s;ion;
<PB N="90" REF="028890_0099_0FDE5C17EBD000E0">
but it was u&s;ually ob&s;erved to begin with|out preceding coldne&s;s, and frequently without marks of preceding languor or debility. The hot fit now ran high, and all the &s;ymptoms were frequently more violent than they had been ob&s;erved to be in the fir&s;t paroxy&s;m. Sweat at la&s;t made its appearance, fol|lowed in mo&s;t ca&s;es by a remi&s;&s;ion, le&s;s perfect in|deed, than the preceding one, but &s;till di&s;tinct enough to be clearly traced. In this manner things went on for a longer or &s;horter &s;pace of time, the paroxy&s;ms u&s;ually increa&s;ing in violence, and the remi&s;&s;ions be|coming &s;ometimes more, though in general le&s;s per|fect, as the di&s;ea&s;e advanced in its progre&s;s. I may further ob&s;erve, that there was occa&s;ionally a change of the type, &s;ometimes a change of the nature of the &s;ymptoms in the cour&s;e of the illne&s;s; and that, where either of the&s;e were the ca&s;e, the di&s;ea&s;e was u&s;ually of longer continuance; at the &s;ame time, that the order of the critical days was di&s;turbed in con&s;e|quence of the&s;e changes.</P>
<P>The re&s;emblances, which I have mentioned above, were found in all the different &s;pecies of the remit|ting fever of Jamaica; but from cau&s;es, which were not always perceived, and which &s;ometimes appeared to be very accidental, the di&s;ea&s;e was di&s;tingui&s;hed in a part, or in the whole of its cour&s;e, by the preva|lence of a train of &s;ymptoms of &s;uch a particular na|ture, as gave occa&s;ion to the di&s;tinctions of inflam|matory, nervous, malignant, putrid or bilious; the &s;eparate hi&s;tories of which I &s;hall now relate more circum&s;tantially.</P>

<P>THE variety of fever, which I &s;hall de&s;cribe fir&s;t, is that, where the inflammatory diathe&s;is prevailed in different degrees. Where this diathe&s;is was moderate, the di&s;ea&s;e was u&s;ually of the lea&s;t complicated form, as well as of the lea&s;t dangerous nature, of any of the fevers of Jamaica. The pa|roxy&s;ms were generally regular, and complete in all their parts, and terminated, for the mo&s;t part, by a copious &s;weat, in a perfect remi&s;&s;ion: the pul&s;e was full, &s;trong, and regular; without uncommon hard|ne&s;s or ten&s;ion; whil&s;t the heat of the &s;kin, though &s;ometimes great in degree, was generally free from that burning pungency, &s;o common in &s;ome other &s;pecies of fever. It was le&s;s removed, in &s;hort, from a &s;imple increa&s;e of the natural warmth. I may fur|ther remark, where this moderate degree of inflam|matory diathe&s;is characterized the genius of the di&s;|ea&s;e, that the danger was &s;eldom great; and that the termination or cri&s;is was generally regular and final. But though this degree of the inflammatory diathe&s;is was frequently ob&s;erved to be a &s;ign of &s;afety, and of regular cri&s;is: yet it al&s;o often happened, where the diathe&s;is prevailed in exce&s;s, that the &s;ymptoms of ex|citement ran unu&s;ually high, and that a &s;erious danger threatened life. The pul&s;e, in &s;uch ca&s;es, was not only frequent during the paroxy&s;m, but it was like|wi&s;e, quick, hard, and vibrating; the heat was often inten&s;e; the internal functions and the various &s;e|cretions, were con&s;iderably di&s;ordered; at the &s;ame time, that a very ob&s;tinate &s;pa&s;modic &s;tricture pre|vailed on the &s;urface of the body. The remi&s;&s;ion which followed, for the mo&s;t part, was ob&s;cure; the
<PB N="92" REF="028890_0101_0FDE5C226292B158">
pul&s;e frequently retaining a preternatural quickne&s;s and hardne&s;s; whil&s;t there was generally a con&s;ider|able degree of febrile heat on the &s;kin.</P>
<P>The &s;ymptoms, which I have ju&s;t now mentioned indicate different degrees of the real inflammatory diathe&s;is; but be&s;ides actual &s;ymptoms of real in|flammatory diathe&s;is, there were likewi&s;e found fevers, with the appearances of a &s;imilar di&s;po&s;ition, though the real genius of the di&s;ea&s;e was in reality of a dif|ferent nature. It is of importance in practice to di&s;|tingui&s;h tho&s;e ambiguous appearances; but it is not always ea&s;y to do it with certainty. We may re|mark, however, that the apparent inflammatory dia|the&s;is was u&s;ually accompanied with marks of great irritability, and &s;ometimes with marks of violent ex|citement during the paroxy&s;ins; while languor and great depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirit were frequently perceived to attend the remi&s;&s;ions. The pul&s;e, which at one time was hard, irregular, and quick, at another was frequent and low, and &s;unk under a &s;mall degree of pre&s;&s;ure. The heat of the body was not always great, yet it was pungent,&mdash;and left a di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation on the hand: the &s;ecretions were often ir|regular; the countenance was confu&s;ed, clouded and overca&s;t, the eye was &s;ad, and &s;ometimes appeared as if it were inflamed; the feelings were unplea&s;ant to the patient him&s;elf: there was great irritability of temper; and the &s;tate of the &s;kin impre&s;&s;ed us with the idea, that there was a &s;trong &s;pa&s;modic &s;tricture prevailing on the &s;urface of the body.&mdash;The above are the principal circum&s;tances, which were u&s;ually pre&s;ent in the different &s;tates of inflammatory fevers; yet the&s;e circum&s;tances were &s;ometimes &s;o variou&s;ly complicated and combined with others, that the ac|curate di&s;crimination of them mu&s;t be left, in mo&s;t ea&s;es, to the ob&s;ervation of the individual him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e different &s;tates and degrees of the inflam|matory diathe&s;is, which I have de&s;cribed above, were
<PB N="93" REF="028890_0102_0FDE5CFE444FB6C8">
&s;ometimes general throughout the whole of the body, not affecting one member more remarkably than an|other; &s;ometimes they were partial or &s;eemed to be connected with a principal affection of a particular part: and where this was the ca&s;e, the local affec|tion, and the general diathe&s;is of the &s;y&s;tem, u&s;ually had a mutual corre&s;pondence with each other. Thus, where the inflammation affected the &s;ub&s;tance of the liver or lungs, the general inflammatory diathe&s;is was u&s;ually in a moderate degree; while the highe&s;t ex|ce&s;s of general va&s;cular excitement often accompanied inflammations of the membranes of tho&s;e organs. But though inflammation of membranes was often accompanied with a high degree of general inflam|matory diathe&s;is; yet there were likewi&s;e &s;ome kinds of tho&s;e local inflammations which communicated only a low, or an ambiguous degree of their diathe&s;is to the general &s;y&s;tem: &s;uch are &s;ome of tho&s;e inflam|mations, which occa&s;ionally affect the &s;urface of the alimentary canal, and which appear, in general, to be of the ery&s;ipelatic kind.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION II. OF FEVER WITH SYMPTOMS OF NERVOUS AF|FECTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE endemic fever of Jamaica, was not oftener di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;ymptoms of general inflam|matory diathe&s;is, than by circum&s;tances of nervous affection. The beginning of this form of the di&s;ea&s;e, was often characterized by a high degree of that di&s;agreeable affection of the &s;tomach, as al&s;o by much of that languor and debility, which are commonly fore-runners of fevers in general. To the&s;e &s;ymp|toms &s;ucceeded a &s;light degree of chilline&s;s, followed
<PB N="94" REF="028890_0103_0FDE5C30AAA1B628">
by a hot fit, which often continued long, but &s;eldom ran high. The pul&s;e was &s;mall, frequent, and ea&s;ily compre&s;&s;ed. It varied with change of po&s;ture;&mdash;and &s;ometimes was &s;o much affected when the patient was rai&s;ed upright, as totally to di&s;appear; the heat of the body was &s;eldom great; the &s;ecretions and ex|ertions were generally irregular, and the internal functions were much di&s;ordered. The mind was u&s;ually affected, affected however in various degrees, and in various ways. Sometimes there was a lively de|lirium, &s;ometimes the delirium was low and de&s;pond|ing; and, as the one or other of the&s;e was the ca&s;e, the appearance of the eye and countenance was chearful or &s;ad. The tongue was &s;ometimes moi&s;t, &s;ometimes dry, but &s;eldom very &s;oul; thir&s;t was irregular, nau&s;ea was frequent, and the &s;tate of the &s;tomach was generally very irritable. There was likewi&s;e, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, deep and heavy &s;ighing, and, unle&s;s in times of pre|ternatural excitement, a very uncommon degree of de&s;pondency. The above were the principal &s;ymp|toms of the nervous fever of Jamaica. The parox|y&s;ms in this di&s;ea&s;e &s;eldom exceeded twelve hours in duration; while the termination or abatement, was u&s;ually di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;weating, though &s;eldom by &s;uch &s;weatings as extended completely to every part of the body. The remi&s;&s;ions were not by any means perfect: the head-ach, and other di&s;agreeable feelings u&s;ually abated; but &s;igns of languor &s;till continued, and marks of &s;pa&s;modic &s;tricture for the mo&s;t part re|mained on the &s;urface of the &s;kin. I may further ob&s;erve, that as the paroxy&s;ms generally increa&s;ed in violence, in the progre&s;s of the fever; &s;o it was very &s;eldom that the remi&s;&s;ions put on an appearance of greater di&s;tinctne&s;s, as the di&s;ea&s;e approached to its termination.</P>
<P>Such is the general hi&s;tory and the progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e, which might be di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of the nervous fever of Jamaica: but be&s;ides tho&s;e cir|cum&s;tances,
<PB N="95" REF="028890_0104_0FDE5D09C5437538">
which I have mentioned above, others were &s;ometimes found attending it, which, though le&s;s regular and con&s;tant, de&s;erve &s;till to be taken no|tice of. Thus the fir&s;t &s;tage of the paroxy&s;m, in&s;tead of the more u&s;ual appearances, was occa&s;ionally di&s;|tingui&s;hed by fits, which appeared to be of the epi|leptic kind. The&s;e fits in &s;ome ca&s;es were &s;ucceeded by a lively delirium, in others by &s;tupor or in&s;en&s;i|bility. The delirium, which was a common &s;ymptom of this di&s;ea&s;e, ran high in &s;everal in&s;tances; though it more generally amounted only to an ab&s;ence of thought, or difficulty of recollection. It is a circum|&s;tance of &s;ome curio&s;ity likewi&s;e, that in&s;tead of a paroxy&s;m, con&s;i&s;ting of different parts in a certain order of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, there was &s;ometimes a total &s;tupor and in&s;en&s;ibility, which continued for a determinate &s;pace of time, without even being &s;ucceeded by ob|vious marks of fever: whil&s;t the time of the paroxy&s;m, in other ca&s;es, was di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;uch a degree of tremor and mobility, as nearly approached to the di&s;ea&s;e known by the name of St. Vitus's dance. And further, be&s;ides the&s;e &s;trange and irregular ap|pearances, &s;pa&s;ms and excruciating pains in different parts of the body, in many in&s;tances, were the lead|ing, indeed almo&s;t the only &s;ymptoms of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>It is not only curious, but it is indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;|&s;ary in the conduct of our practice, to ob&s;erve with attention the various modes of action of the cau&s;e of fevers, and to e&s;timate with preci&s;ion the various combinations. The cau&s;e of fevers, in exerting its principal action on the nervous &s;y&s;tem, &s;ometimes produces excitement, &s;ometimes occa&s;ions depre&s;&s;ion; effects oppo&s;ite to each other in their nature. Ex|citement and depre&s;&s;ion are two general and oppo&s;ite modes of action; yet be&s;ides the&s;e we often ob&s;erve others, which do not belong wholly to the one or the other, but which &s;eem to be compounded of both, in a manner we do not very well comprehend. This
<PB N="96" REF="028890_0105_0FDE5C41B12515D0">
cau&s;e of fever likewi&s;e, which acts in directly oppo|&s;ite ways, appears al&s;o to exert its action more pow|erfully at different times on one part of the &s;y&s;tem than on another; that is, it acts &s;ometimes more im|mediately on the brain, or rea&s;oning faculty, &s;ome|times more directly on the nerves, or moving powers of the body. It may even be ob&s;erved further, that all the&s;e modes of action, which are pre&s;erved di&s;tinct at one time, are combined in various degrees at an|other. Thus, where the cau&s;e of fever acts by pro|ducing excitement, lively delirium in various degrees is the con&s;equence; while languor, &s;tupor, and in|&s;en&s;ibility naturally follow the oppo&s;ite mode of ac|tion. Low delirium, tremors, &s;tartings, &amp;c. are pro|bably owing to a compound effect. Both modes of action &s;ucceed each other rapidly; or perhaps both modes are actually pre&s;ent at the &s;ame time, though probably in different degrees, in the different por|tions of the brain. This fact at lea&s;t is certain, that obvious depre&s;&s;ion is often combined with &s;igns of great irritability. It is a remark likewi&s;e of con&s;ider|able importance, that the natural functions are le&s;s di&s;ordered, where the cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e acts upon the nervous &s;y&s;tem internally, or principally di&s;turbs the intellectual powers, than where this action is ob|viou&s;ly external: the pul&s;e is then more regular, though often ob&s;cure; the di&s;po&s;ition to faint is not &s;o great; mu&s;cular mobility is le&s;s remarkable, and local pains are felt le&s;s acutely. On the contrary, where this cau&s;e acts externally, or chiefly affects the moving powers, the di&s;po&s;ition to faint in changing po&s;ture is more remarkable; tremors, &s;tartings, &amp;c. are more common; appearances, in &s;hort, are more fluctuat|ing and often more alarming.</P>
<P>It is a matter not le&s;s u&s;eful than curious to di&s;tin|gui&s;h the different &s;pecies of delirium in fevers, to trace the different combinations, and to mark the ap|parently trivial cau&s;es, which excite, or which &s;ome|times
<PB N="97" REF="028890_0106_0FDE5D13B0BD2C40">
remove tho&s;e derangements of the rea&s;oning fa|culty. It is a remark, which has been often made, that while one delirious per&s;on in fever appears only to be in better &s;pirits than u&s;ual, another, or perhaps the &s;ame per&s;on in another paroxy&s;m of the &s;ame di&s;|ea&s;e, is outrageous or perfectly furious. A third is low and languid, ab&s;ent and inattentive, or, with a fixed look of vacancy, does not &s;eem to be otherwi&s;e deranged, than by requiring greater time to recollect him&s;elf. To which we may add, that there are &s;ome, who talk coolly on things in general; but who cannot bear mention of &s;ome particular &s;ubjects.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION III. OF FEVER IN WHICH ARE DISCOVERED SIGNS OF MALIGNITY.</HEAD>
<P>THE fever of Jamaica, as di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;igns of inflammatory diathe&s;is, or by circum&s;tances of nervous affection, prevailed principally at Savan|na la Mar; yet be&s;ides the above forms of the di&s;|ea&s;e, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">re &s;ometimes likewi&s;e occurred others, which &s;hewed marks of peculiar malignity. It is difficult to define preci&s;ely in words the character of the di&s;|ea&s;e, which I now attempt to di&s;cribe; its di&s;crimi|nating marks, not con&s;i&s;ting &s;o much in one or two &s;ymptoms, as in a certain a&s;&s;emblage of circum&s;tances re&s;iding chiefly in the &s;tate of the eye and counte|nance of the patient, and conveyed with difficulty in verbal de&s;cription. I may remark, in the fir&s;t place, that there was &s;eldom any thing very particu|lar in the manner of inva&s;ion of this &s;pecies of di&s;|ea&s;e. The cold fit was rarely violent in degree, though it was often of long continuance: neither did the hot
<PB N="98" REF="028890_0107_0FDE5C4E14470270">
fit u&s;ually run high, in the common acceptation of the word, though it was &s;ometimes attended with circum|&s;tances peculiarly di&s;agreeable. The pul&s;e varied re|markably. It was ob&s;cure, or &s;carcely to be felt in &s;ome; in others it was &s;trong, though unequally &s;o; the artery, in many in&s;tances, being hard and con|tracted, with a peculiar vibration in the &s;troke. Af|ter the&s;e &s;ymptoms and others, which are u&s;ual in this &s;tage of fever, had continued for a longer or &s;horter time, &s;weat began to make its appearance on the head and brea&s;t, which extending it&s;elf gradually to every part of the body, was at la&s;t followed by a remi&s;&s;ion, tolerably perfect for the mo&s;t part, though there &s;till remained &s;ome &s;trange and unplea&s;ant &s;en&s;ations. It does not appear that there is any thing very uncom|mon in the &s;ymptoms, which I have hitherto taken notice of: tho&s;e which follow are more characteri&s;tic. The &s;tate of the eye and countenance, afford the &s;ure&s;t &s;igns of the malignity of the di&s;ea&s;e; but there is dif|ficulty in di&s;criminating tho&s;e appearances. The face is not unu&s;ually flu&s;hed in fevers; but, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, the countenance exhibits &s;omething el&s;e be&s;ides an appearance of &s;imple flu&s;hing. It is likewi&s;e grim, dark and overca&s;t, with &s;uch marks of confu&s;ion and di&s;tre&s;s, as if the patient were agitated by &s;ome re|&s;entful pa&s;&s;ion. The eye is &s;ad and de&s;ponding; and the whole appearance, in &s;hort, indicates &s;uch a &s;tate of mind, as we &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed to &s;tyle malignant. It is in &s;uch a &s;tate of the countenance as I have de&s;|cribed, that the character of this &s;pecies of fever chiefly re&s;ides; yet be&s;ides this, &s;ome other circum|&s;tances frequently attend the di&s;ea&s;e, which are le&s;s u&s;ual in ordinary fevers. The paroxy&s;m for in&s;tance returned, for the mo&s;t part, much &s;ooner than the regular period, always with greater violence, and &s;ometimes with new and alarming &s;ymptoms. It de|clined in twelve or fourteen hours; but the remi&s;&s;ion was le&s;s perfect than the preceding one; the next re|turn
<PB N="99" REF="028890_0108_0FDE5D19B8ACDD88">
of fever, which was likewi&s;e much earlier than the &s;tated hour, was often u&s;hered in by convul&s;ions, and the time of it occupied by &s;tupor or coma. The tongue was likewi&s;e irregularly moi&s;t or dry. If dry, it was generally covered with a black &s;curf; if moi&s;t, with a thin glutinous coat, through which the red &s;urface &s;hining ob&s;curely, pre&s;ented an appearance of a leaden colour. In this ca&s;e the mouth abounded with a ropy &s;aliva. But be&s;ides the above &s;ymptoms, there were al&s;o violent twitchings in the &s;tomach and bowels, &s;udden &s;queami&s;hne&s;s, faintne&s;s, anxiety, re&s;t|le&s;&s;ne&s;s, frightful dreams, di&s;tre&s;&s;ing apprehen&s;ions, and frequently after the &s;econd paroxy&s;m, a particu|lar crouded eruption (not unlike iron-burnt bli&s;ters,) on the upper lip, which for the mo&s;t part &s;pread to|wards the no&s;e. The type of this fever, it may be further remarked, was u&s;ually of the &s;ingle tertian kind, generally anticipating by long anticipations. In mo&s;t in&s;tances this malignant di&s;po&s;ition was di&s;|coverable at the very beginning; yet in others, no &s;ymptoms of a doubtful nature made their appearance till after the third revolution.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION IV. OF FEVERS IN WHICH ARE OBSERVED SYMP|TOMS OF A PUTRESCENT TENDENCY.</HEAD>
<P>WE meet with the term putrid fever, or fever with putre&s;cent tendency, in the writings of almo&s;t every author who has treated of the di&s;ea&s;es of hot climates: but though this expre&s;&s;ion is &s;o much the common language of practitioners, I cannot held ob&s;erving, that a remitting fever, with &s;ymptoms of a &s;pecific putrefaction, did not once occur to my
<PB N="100" REF="028890_0109_0FDE5C5813CBC3A8">
ob&s;ervation in the i&s;land of Jamaica, during the time that I lived in that country. I mu&s;t however add, that though a remitting fever &s;pecifically putrid is ac|tually a rare di&s;ea&s;e; yet I do not attempt to deny, that a putre&s;cent tendency is frequently pre&s;ent in the primae viae, in a very con&s;iderable degree; and that marks of it are &s;ometimes di&s;coverable, even in the general &s;y&s;tem, at a late period of the illne&s;s, when the vigour of life has abated, and the powers of cir|culation have begun to fail. This however is &s;o ac|cidental and une&s;&s;ential, that it is only in compliance with the general language of medical people, that I think it nece&s;&s;ary to de&s;cribe a di&s;ea&s;e, where the&s;e &s;ymptoms are ob&s;erved to prevail. The tendency to putrefaction, which was ob&s;erved in the fever of Ja|maica, &s;ometimes begins in the primae viae; and from the primae viae was communicated to the re&s;t of the &s;y&s;tem; &s;ometimes it remained confined to the limits of the inte&s;tinal canal, throughout the whole dura|tion of the di&s;order; in which ca&s;e flatulence, ructus, anxiety, nau&s;ea and thir&s;t were the &s;ymptoms which were chiefly trouble&s;ome: the belly likewi&s;e was ge|nerally loo&s;e, at the &s;ame time that the &s;tools were dark and fetid. But where this tendency was com|municated from the primae viae to the re&s;t of the body, or othewi&s;e made its appearance in the general &s;y&s;tem, a form of di&s;ea&s;e aro&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hed by the following &s;ymptoms. If the tendency to putrefaction appeared at an early period, the heat of the &s;kin made a more di&s;agreeable impre&s;&s;ion on the hand, than was u&s;ual in &s;ome other fevers; the &s;kin it&s;elf was likewi&s;e for the mo&s;t part, dry and con&s;tricted; the thir&s;t was ir|regular, &s;ometimes inten&s;e, &s;ometimes from local af|fection of the &s;auces, apparently little increa&s;ed.&mdash;The appearance of the eye was often &s;ad; &s;ometimes it gli&s;tened with unu&s;ual brilliancy; &s;ometimes it &s;eem|ed to be inflamed. The countenance was generally flu&s;hed, often particularly confu&s;ed, and of a grim
<PB N="101" REF="028890_0110_0FDE5D1FF9EB6098">
and clouded a&s;pect. I have however frequently ob|&s;erved, where &s;ymptoms of putre&s;cency di&s;covered them&s;elves at a late period of a fever, the preceding cour&s;e of which had been di&s;tingui&s;hed by circum|&s;tances of nervous affection, that the bloom of the complexion was uncommonly fine and delicate. To the above &s;ymptoms might be added, great irritabi|lity of temper, general unea&s;ine&s;s of &s;en&s;ation, and di&s;order in all the functions of the body. When the fever a&s;&s;umed this appearance, paroxy&s;ms and remi&s;|&s;ions were generally ob&s;cure and irregular. The fe|ver indeed often &s;ub&s;ided in a &s;mall degree; but the future remi&s;&s;ions generally became le&s;s di&s;tinct, as the di&s;ea&s;e proceeded in its cour&s;e. The tongue a&s;|&s;umed different appearances, at different periods and in different per&s;ons. In &s;ome it was moi&s;t, in others parched and dry. It was not univer&s;ally foul, at lea&s;t it frequently happened, that the edges were clear and beautifully red in their colour. The lips likewi&s;e were &s;ometimes &s;mooth, and of a cherry-like appear|ance; at the &s;ame time that the gums were inflamed and &s;pongy, as they u&s;ually are in &s;curvy: the pul&s;e likewi&s;e was &s;mall for the mo&s;t part; but it was irre|gularly &s;o. I &s;ay nothing of the di&s;po&s;ition to faint in erect po&s;ture, which though generally enumerated among the &s;igns of putrid fevers by authors, does not in fact appear to con&s;titute a criterion of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION V. OF FEVERS ACCOMPANIED WITH AN INCREASED SECRETION OF BILE.</HEAD>
<P>THOSE &s;pecies of fevers, which I have men|tioned above, &s;eem to affect the general &s;y&s;tem, or every part of the body nearly alike; but be&s;ides the&s;e, we &s;ometimes meet with others, which are di&s;tingui&s;hed by local affections, or increa&s;ed deter|minations to particular parts in a degree &s;o remark|able, as to per&s;onate very exactly a peripneumony, a hepatitis, or inflammation of the bowels; the accom|panying fever being at the &s;ame time &s;o &s;light, as &s;carcely to be con&s;idered as a primary affection. As an accident &s;imilar to the&s;e local affections of the liver or lungs, we may reckon an increa&s;ed &s;ecre|tion of bile. The cau&s;e of fever, from circum&s;tances which we do not always perceive, &s;ometimes acts with particular violence on the biliary &s;y&s;tem, in con|&s;equence of which the &s;ecretion of bile being preter|naturally increa&s;ed, a di&s;ea&s;e ari&s;es, which without much impropriety may be called bilious. But though this irregular action of the morbid cau&s;e, on the bi|liary &s;y&s;tem, frequently gives ri&s;e to bilious appear|ances in the fevers of Jamaica; yet the&s;e appearances are in fact often owing to cau&s;es more accidental, and more remote than even this. Nau&s;ea and vo|miting are among the common &s;ymptoms of fevers in every country; but they are particularly frequent in tho&s;e of the We&s;t-Indies. It is well known that a continuance of nau&s;ea, or that a repetition of the action of vomiting, increa&s;es the determination, not only to the &s;tomach, but likewi&s;e to the parts which are near to it. Hence the &s;ecretion of bile is pre|ternaturally increa&s;ed &s;econdarily by the ordinary ef|fect of vomiting, and bilious appearances become a
<PB N="103" REF="028890_0112_0FDE5D2839CFCE00">
nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of this accidental &s;ymptom of the di&s;ea&s;e. In tho&s;e two manners, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> in con&s;equence of the irregular action of the morbid cau&s;e on the immediately biliary &s;y&s;tem, or from a &s;econdary ef|fect in con&s;equence of its action on the &s;tomach, the the bilious fever may, in &s;ome re&s;pects, be con&s;idered as a di&s;ea&s;e of nature; but be&s;ides this, it often ori|ginates from our own treatment, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> from the re|peated u&s;e of emetics, or of cathartics, which are vio|lent in their operation. The accidental appearance of bilious vomitings, in the fevers of hot climates, fur|ni&s;hed medical authors with a pretence of forming a new theory, and of directing the mode of practice to a particular view. Influenced by this appearance, they a&s;&s;ume it as a fact, that a vitiated quality, or a redundant quantity of bile con&s;titutes the e&s;&s;ential cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e; and on this foundation adopt the plan of repeated evacuating, both upwards and downwards; a practice which evidently increa&s;es the &s;ecretion of the bile. Hence, a di&s;ea&s;e, or the &s;ymp|tom of a di&s;ea&s;e, ari&s;es wholly from this mode of treat|ment; and the removal or cure of it is afterwards attempted by a per&s;everance in the means, which ori|ginally gave ri&s;e to it:&mdash;of this I have &s;een numerous examples.</P>
<P>I have now de&s;cribed the remitting fever of Ja|maica, as characteri&s;ed by &s;ymptoms of a different appearance. I may further remark, that where the&s;e &s;ymptoms were unmixed with each other, there was little difficulty in the di&s;tinction, and little embarra&s;&s;|ment in planning or executing the indications of cure: but it &s;ometimes al&s;o happened, that the different &s;pe|cies, which I have de&s;cribed &s;eparately, was &s;o per|plexed and complicated, that it appeared uncertain to which kind the di&s;ea&s;e properly belonged; or to which view the practice ought to be principally di|rected. Symptoms of putre&s;cency, for in&s;tance, were often combined with &s;ymptoms of apparent inflam|matory
<PB N="104" REF="028890_0113_0FDE5C6A719279B8">
diathe&s;is; as fevers with nervous affection, or putre&s;cent tendency, were &s;ometimes accompanied with marks of peculiar malignity. It happened often likewi&s;e, that the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e &s;uffered a total change after a certain duration; or that a fever with one train of &s;ymptoms cea&s;ed, whil&s;t another with a different train began.</P>
<P>It would be a matter of no &s;mall importance, were we able to a&s;certain the various cau&s;es, which influ|ence the various appearances of the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e; but this knowledge is not ea&s;ily attained:&mdash;much of it indeed lies beyond the reach of our comprehen&s;ion. We may however remark, that the &s;ea&s;on of the year u&s;ually has &s;ome effect on the diathe&s;is of the &s;y&s;tem, and often on the type and form of the fever. Thus, in the dry &s;ea&s;on, though the remi&s;&s;ions are not always more perfect, the type is commonly more &s;imple, and the general diathe&s;is is oftener inflammatory. In the rainy months, on the contrary, remi&s;&s;ions are more perceivable, but the type is more complicated, and the general diathe&s;is of the &s;y&s;tem has a &s;tronger ten|dency to putre&s;cency, often with a mixture of &s;ymp|toms of nervous affection, &s;ometimes with &s;ymptoms of a malignant nature. The &s;tomach, bowels, and biliary &s;y&s;tem likewi&s;e &s;uffer more in this &s;ea&s;on than in the drier months of the year. But be&s;ides this difference, which ari&s;es from &s;ea&s;on, we al&s;o find very con&s;tant effects from local &s;ituation. Thus in hilly countries there is generally more of the inflammatory diathe&s;is, with more frequent determination to the head and lungs, and le&s;s obvious remi&s;&s;ions, than in flat and champaign countries, where the &s;tomach and biliary &s;y&s;tem &s;uffer in a more peculiar manner.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. OF PROGNOSTIC IN THE FEVERS OF JAMAICA.</HEAD>
<P>TO be able to perceive at a di&s;tance, the approach of danger or returning health, is a knowledge highly &s;atisfactory and u&s;eful to the phy&s;ician; but it is a knowledge which is not ea&s;ily attained: for to judge with certainty of the event of fevers, requires not only long and attentive ob&s;ervation, but a di&s;|crimination of complicated and ambiguous appear|ances, which does not depend always upon attention alone. The &s;agacious Hippocrates is generally con|&s;idered as the fir&s;t, who laid the foundation of the &s;cience of progno&s;tic; and we certainly mu&s;t allow, that he has left us many important and valuable ob|&s;ervations on the &s;ubject; yet we may al&s;o add, that his deci&s;ions in many in&s;tances, are precipitate. Hippocrates &s;eems generally to have placed too great confidence in &s;igns &s;eparately con&s;idered, and to have formed his conclu&s;ions too often on the authority of &s;ingle facts. Thus he has &s;ometimes con&s;idered as fatal in them&s;elves tho&s;e &s;igns, which in reality are only dangerous. The ab&s;olutely fatal &s;igns in fevers are actually few in number. I am able to affirm, from my own experience, that people are &s;ometimes re&s;tored to health after many of the u&s;ually reputed fore-runners of death are pre&s;ent. We have, in fact, as yet only an imperfect knowledge of progno&s;tic in fevers; but the field is &s;till open, and careful ob&s;er|vation, it is to be hoped, may enable us in time to &s;upply the defects. I dare not venture to a&s;&s;ert, that I have advanced beyond others in this nece&s;&s;ary and difficult &s;cience; but I am di&s;po&s;ed to flatter my&s;elf, that the following attempt to appreciate the marks of danger or &s;afety in the fevers of Jamaica, may be
<PB N="106" REF="028890_0115_0FDE5C7359499648">
found in &s;ome degree u&s;eful. It contains the re&s;ult of my own ob&s;ervations in that country; and though I am perfectly con&s;cious that the rules are often defec|tive, yet I likewi&s;e know, that I have &s;ugge&s;ted &s;ome hints which have not been commonly ob&s;erved, and which may help to direct tho&s;e, who have not had much experience of their own.</P>
<P>Progno&s;tic is &s;uch, as applies to fevers in general, or more particularly to the different &s;pecies of the di&s;ea&s;e. The type or form, the general cour&s;e and tenor of the di&s;orders, and the <HI>general</HI> nature of the paroxy&s;ms often afford u&s;eful information. From the type alone, we do not often obtain much that is to be depended upon. Long and di&s;tinct intermi&s;&s;ions are commonly accounted &s;igns of &s;afety; yet we fre|quently &s;ee in&s;tances of the &s;ingle tertian proving fatal, while types of greater complication are often void of danger: in general, however, complicated types are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and perhaps more commonly fatal than others. But though a knowledge of the type of the fever ab&s;tractedly con&s;idered, does not com|monly afford any material indication of danger or &s;afety, yet the time of the return of the paroxy&s;m is a &s;ubject, from which more may be learned. An an|ticipation of an hour or two, is &s;eldom much to be regarded; yet an anticipation of ten or twelve is al|ways &s;u&s;picious. It either indicates a latent malig|nity, or a tendency in the di&s;ea&s;e to change to a con|tinued form. The complication of another fever, or the doubling of type is by no means favourable; yet it is much le&s;s to be dreaded, than a long and an ir|regular anticipation. Anticipations have been gene|rally con&s;idered as &s;igns of the increa&s;ing force of the fever; &s;o the type which po&s;tpones, is u&s;ually be|lieved to indicate a di&s;ea&s;e, which is ha&s;tening to a fa|vourable termination: the effect however is &s;ome|times the contrary. I have my&s;elf &s;een &s;ome in&s;tances, where, in con&s;equence perhaps of weakne&s;s and im|paired
<PB N="107" REF="028890_0116_0FDE5D34A8DA63A8">
&s;en&s;ibility, the return of the fatal paroxy&s;m, though it probably ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> commenced &s;ooner, was not clearly perceived till after the u&s;ual hour of attack. But be&s;ides tho&s;e indications of danger or &s;afety, which may be drawn from the nature of the &s;imple type, or from the hour of return of the paroxy&s;m, the &s;tate of the paroxy&s;ms and remi&s;&s;ions de&s;erves likewi&s;e to be attended to. It was generally ob&s;erved where the paroxy&s;ms were regular, and a&s;&s;umed a com|pleter form in the progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e, that there was not generally much rea&s;on to dread an unfavourable event. Hopes of &s;afety might likewi&s;e be entertained with &s;till greater confidence, where the paroxy&s;ms, though more violent in degree, became more regular and di&s;tinct after the u&s;e of bark, wine and &s;timulants. On the contrary, it was always an indication of danger, where they became longer or lo&s;t the di&s;tinctne&s;s and regularity of their form, as the di&s;ea&s;e advanced in its progre&s;s. Changes from bad to good, in the cour&s;e of the fever, al&s;o indicated more &s;afety as the oppo&s;ite changes indicated more danger, than if cir|cum&s;tances equally unfavourable had continued from the beginning.</P>
<P>In enumerating tho&s;e particular &s;igns or &s;ymptoms, from which we are led to form a judgment of the event of the remitting fever of Jamaica, I &s;hall con|&s;ider in the fir&s;t place the &s;tate of the pul&s;e. The pul&s;e is &s;o differently affected by the &s;ame cau&s;es in different people, and individually &s;ubject to &s;o many peculiarities, that conclu&s;ions formed &s;olely upon this ba&s;is mu&s;t ever be fallacious. Hippocrates, who has treated very fully of the other &s;igns of progno&s;tic, is totally &s;ilent on the &s;ubject of the pul&s;e. He has mentioned the term, indeed, in &s;everal parts of his works; but it does not appear, that he had a perfect knowledge of the nature and indications of the pul|&s;ations of the arteries. The &s;ubject was &s;omewhat better under&s;tood before the time of Cel&s;us: yet this
<PB N="108" REF="028890_0117_0FDE5C7AA86ABDA0">
author does not believe, that any information could be drawn from the &s;tate of the pul&s;e alone, which was in any great degree to be depended upon. Galen, who is generally diffu&s;e on every &s;ubject, has treated very fully of the nature of the pul&s;e. He has indeed multiplied di&s;tinctions to an amazing extent, and &s;ugge&s;ted combinations of endle&s;s variety; yet notwith&s;tanding this apparent minutene&s;s, there are &s;till &s;everal important ob&s;ervations with re&s;pect to it, which have e&s;caped him altogether. It is not many years ago, that Dr. Solano, a Spani&s;h phy&s;ician who practi&s;ed at Antequiera, opened &s;ome new and cu|rious views concerning the pul&s;e, and its various indications.</P>
<P>The detail of facts with which this writer has fur|ni&s;hed us, is really wonderful, and the candour with which he has related them, independent of the te&s;ti|mony of &s;everal re&s;pectable authorities, engages us to give him credit. I had not heard of Solano's di&s;|coveries at the time I lived in Jamaica, and I do not find that I had ever taken notice of ob&s;ervations &s;imilar to tho&s;e he has mentioned. I was able indeed, for the mo&s;t part, to foretel from the nature of the pul&s;e, even in the beginning of the di&s;ea&s;e, whether the fever would be of a continued or remitting form; but I did not di&s;cover any &s;igns from it, which led me to form a judgment of the future mode of termi|nation. I may add, that I met not with any in&s;tances of cri&s;is by haemorrhage; neither did I ever take no|tice of the rebounding pul&s;e. The intermitting pul&s;e occurred frequently, &s;ometimes as a forerunner of death, &s;ometimes as an attendant of favourable cri&s;is: but I cannot &s;ay, that I ob&s;erved that it ever pre&s;aged a future diarrhea. I &s;hall however pa&s;s over the ob&s;ervations of others without further comment for the pre&s;ent, and content my&s;elf with relating tho&s;e circum&s;tances of pul&s;e connected with danger or &s;afety, as they occurred to my own ob&s;ervation in the
<PB N="109" REF="028890_0118_0FDE5D3D0D10F498">
remitting fever of the We&s;t Indies. I mu&s;t remark in the fir&s;t place, that independent of peculiarities of con&s;titution, a weak, a feeble and ea&s;ily compre&s;&s;ed pul&s;e was generally a bad one: a pul&s;e which was indi&s;tinct and &s;mall, or &s;mall and hard, particularly at a late period of the di&s;ea&s;e, or together with de|lirium or clammy &s;weats, indicated for the mo&s;t part, the mo&s;t extreme degree of danger. That &s;pecies of pul&s;e moreover, where the &s;troke was ob&s;cure, or felt with difficulty, was &s;u&s;picious at all times; but it was particularly dangerous where accompanied with a wavering, a tremulous, a con&s;tantly creeping or vermicular motion in the artery. I am not certain that my meaning will be clearly under&s;tood; yet I believe that tho&s;e who have once ob&s;erved this tre|mulous and creeping pul&s;e, will not ea&s;ily forget the danger which it indicates. It often attended a fever of a malignant kind, where the nervous influence ap|peared in &s;ome degree, to be &s;u&s;pended.&mdash;But to pro|ceed: it is an ob&s;ervation &s;o well known as to render any mention of it almo&s;t &s;uperfluous, that a frequent, an irregular, a fluttering and intermitting pul&s;e com|monly indicates danger, &s;ometimes approaching death: yet I mu&s;t add, that an intermitting pul&s;e &s;ometimes attended the favourable cri&s;is of a peculiar &s;pecies of fever. It was ob&s;erved, however, in &s;uch ca&s;es, that the pul&s;e was not otherwi&s;e irregular, than by failing in its &s;troke at the end of every third or fourth pul&s;a|tion, neither was it generally found to be uncom|monly frequent. Some in&s;tances of this &s;ingular appearance occurred to me during the time that I remained in Jamaica: &s;o that I was in &s;ome degree di&s;|po&s;ed to rank the intermitting pul&s;e among the &s;igns of favourable cri&s;is, in a &s;pecies of fever, the pre|ceding cour&s;e of which had been di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;ymptoms of a peculiar nervous affection. When I became acquainted afterwards with the ob&s;erva|tions of Dr. Solano, I began to doubt whether the
<PB N="110" REF="028890_0119_0FDE5C82CA14AC58">
intermi&s;&s;ion of pul&s;e, which I had met with in the fevers of Jamaica, might not have been a &s;ign of ap|proaching diarrhea, which had not occurred to my notice, rather than a &s;ign of proper cri&s;is, as I had formerly imagined. I remained in this uncertainty till lately, that &s;ome in&s;tances of this &s;ymptom hap|pening at the termination of fevers in this country, have helped to confirm me in the opinion which I entertained before. I found in tho&s;e ca&s;es to which I allude, that the pul&s;e intermitted after every third or fourth &s;troke on the day, on which I expected the cri&s;is. The intermi&s;&s;ion of the pul&s;e was not of &s;uch a nature as indicated approaching death; I there|fore looked watchfully for a diarrhea, but no diarrhea en&s;ued. It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, indeed, that one of the patients &s;eemed to be much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed with gripes and flatus; but being deprived of the power of &s;peech we could not obtain any accurate idea of his feelings: and no evacuation actually took place, till the day following, before which time the intermi&s;&s;ion had di&s;|appeared altogether.&mdash;Be&s;ides the above, there are &s;ome other &s;igns of pul&s;e which have their particular indications; but they are &s;o generally known, that it will not be nece&s;&s;ary to enlarge on the &s;ubject. I &s;hall therefore only ob&s;erve further, that changes from better to wor&s;e in the &s;tate of the pul&s;e, as the di&s;|ea&s;e advances in its progre&s;s, are bad, while the op|po&s;ite changes are favourable: yet I mu&s;t likewi&s;e add, that in tho&s;e ca&s;es of favourable change, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;tingui&s;h carefully the pul&s;e of coma, from the pul&s;e of returning health.&mdash;The difference is &s;ometimes &s;carcely to be known, except from the attending &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>Next to the &s;tate of the pul&s;e, I &s;hall mention tho&s;e appearances of the tongue, which, together with other concomitant circum&s;tances, frequently afford &s;igns of the mildne&s;s or malignity of the di&s;ea&s;e. Though we do not expect that the tongue &s;hould be
<PB N="111" REF="028890_0120_0FDE5D4351767968">
of a healthy a&s;pect, during the continuance of a fever; yet where it is dry only in a moderate degree, or where it is covered with a &s;mooth and whiti&s;h coat, the di&s;ea&s;e for the mo&s;t part, is void of malignity, though not always of danger. On the contrary, where it is immoderately dry, or dry and black, the indications of danger are great, and I may add, &s;till greater where a white &s;limy and glutinous &s;ub&s;tance covers its &s;urface. This &s;limy &s;tate of the tongue was often &s;een at an early period, and as far as my experience goes, con&s;tantly indicated malignity. To the above we may add, a &s;odden or parboiled ap|pearance of the tongue, which was not of le&s;s dan|gerous import than the preceding. But be&s;ides tho&s;e obviou&s;ly unhealthy a&s;pects of the tongue, its appear|ance in &s;ome in&s;tances was not different from its na|tural &s;tate, except in a certain lividne&s;s of colour. This was con&s;tantly &s;u&s;picious, and if not fatal, was always extremely dangerous. The danger indicated by the tongue, when it is inten&s;ely dry, rough, crack|ed, or ulcerated is generally known; but I mu&s;t not omit to mention, that when from a dry and unheal|thy &s;tate, it turns moi&s;t &s;uddenly, or a&s;&s;umes its na|tural appearance, whil&s;t the other &s;igns of favourable cri&s;is did not &s;hew them&s;elves at the &s;ame time, a change of the mode of action of the febrile cau&s;e is indicated,&mdash;and generally a dangerous one.&mdash;I &s;ay nothing of palene&s;s and tremor, as the&s;e &s;ymptoms only indicate certain &s;tates of general or particular debility of the nervous &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>Vomiting is another of the alarming, and &s;ome|times of the dangerous &s;ymptoms of the fevers of the We&s;t-Indies. If this &s;ymptom continues during the remi&s;&s;ion of the fever, without material abatement, there is rea&s;on to dread its con&s;equences; but if it vani&s;hes or abates in a very material degree at the decline of the paroxy&s;m, it does not de&s;erve to be &s;o particularly regarded. The practice however to
<PB N="112" REF="028890_0121_0FDE5C888290F798">
which it leads is often &s;erious. Vomiting is &s;up|po&s;ed by mo&s;t practitioners to indicate emetics; but the indication is fallacious, and the practice is often pernicious. During the time that I lived in Jamaica, I had frequent opportunities of &s;eeing vomitings ren|dered continual by the repeated u&s;e of emetics, which before this treatment, appeared to be only accidental &s;ymptoms during the paroxy&s;m of the di&s;ea&s;e. I therefore at la&s;t became cautious of pur&s;uing this view, and have rea&s;on to believe, that if I did not oftener do good than others, I &s;eldomer increa&s;ed the danger. But be&s;ides the degree and frequency of the vomiting, the nature of the matters thrown up may likewi&s;e furni&s;h indications of the danger or &s;afety of the fever. The various kinds of bilious vo|mitings have been fully explained, and the danger of each has been &s;o particularly pointed out by many writers, e&s;pecially by Hippocrates, that I pa&s;s over the &s;ubject without further notice, con&s;idering it un|nece&s;&s;ary to repeat the ob&s;ervations of others. I mu&s;t however remark a more uncommon kind of vomiting, which &s;ometimes happened in the fevers of Jamaica, and which I believe has hitherto e&s;caped the notice of ob&s;ervers. The vomiting to which I allude in this place, is a vomiting of a clear and ropy liquor, in which are often found &s;wimming flakes of a darker coloured mucus. This appearance was chiefly ob&s;erved, where the remi&s;&s;ions were indi&s;tinct, and the &s;weats partial and incomplete. It con&s;tantly afforded an indication of danger, and I &s;eldom found that the u&s;ual remedies were effectual in re&s;training it. Vomitings of black and vitiated matters are com|monly known to be of the mo&s;t dangerous import,&mdash;&s;ucceeded by ob&s;cure hickupings, they are often fore|runners of death. Yet though this is generally true, I mu&s;t not at the &s;ame time omit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> mention, that I have &s;een &s;everal in&s;tances of recovery where black vomiting had prevailed for &s;ome time; and other
<PB N="113" REF="028890_0122_0FDE5D49B45D1EF0">
ca&s;es which give me room to conclude, that hickup|ings are not con&s;tantly fatal. I take the pre&s;ent oppor|tunity to remark, that hickup was &s;ometimes only a di&s;tingui&s;hing &s;ymptom of the di&s;ea&s;e, which increa&s;ed or declined with the paroxy&s;m; and that in other in|&s;tances it attended the favourable cri&s;is of fevers, the preceding cour&s;e of which had been characteri&s;ed by &s;ymptoms of nervous affection. This &s;pecies of hickup was generally alarming in degree, and equally inexplicable with the intermitting pul&s;e, which I mentioned above as &s;ometimes attending a favourable termination. It often continued the &s;pace of twenty-four hours, in &s;pite of all that could be done by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|dicine.</P>
<P>Next to the indications of vomiting, I &s;hall enu|merate &s;uch as may be drawn from the pre&s;ence or ab&s;ence of thir&s;t. Immoderate and unquenchable thir&s;t has always been reckoned an unfavourable &s;ymptom in fevers. It is &s;o undoubtedly, yet I have frequently &s;een very extraordinary degrees of it con|tinuing for a length of time, without particular dan|ger. Be&s;ides the de&s;ire for liquid in general, there is often an unconquerable longing for drinks of a particular kind;&mdash;a feeling which ought always to be attended to, and frequently complied with.&mdash;The de&s;ire for cold water is &s;ometimes ravenous.&mdash;I have known it not only &s;atiated with &s;afety, but even with good effects. But though this immoderate thir&s;t is ju&s;tly reckoned a bad &s;ymptom in fevers; yet an in|difference for liquid, with a dry tongue, and other marks of internal heat, is &s;till wor&s;e. It has indeed been generally con&s;idered as fatal; but here we ought to di&s;tingui&s;h, whether it proceeds from local affec|tion of the tongue and fauces, or from a general failure of the powers of life. In the one ca&s;e it is a mortal &s;ign, in the other it can only be &s;aid to be dangerous.</P>
<P>The ancients, particularly Hippocrates and his
<PB N="114" REF="028890_0123_0FDE5C8F1AEFE3A8">
commentator Galen, have treated &s;o fully of the in|dications of evacuations downwards, that I &s;hould be able to do little more than to copy their ob&s;erva|tions. There is one &s;pecies of evacuation, however, which they do not appear to have de&s;cribed very ex|plicitly, and which I have often ob&s;erved to be at|tended with great danger. This is the frequent, &s;mall and ineffective excretion, and more particularly copious &s;tools, which re&s;emble dirty water, e&s;pecially if accompanied with ten&s;ion of the hypochondria and abdomen.</P>
<P>Medical writers have been long accu&s;tomed to form a progno&s;tic of the event of fevers, from pu&s;tular or &s;cabby eruptions about the mouth: but the &s;ign is ambiguous, and cannot be depended upon, with|out many limitations. I &s;hall however relate that which has occurred to my own ob&s;ervation, without troubling my&s;elf about the opinions of others. And I remark in the fir&s;t place, that an eruption about the corners of the mouth, and near the lips, which comes forth freely, and &s;oon turns into a &s;cab, particularly if it does not appear till after the third revolution of the di&s;ea&s;e, affords a general &s;ign of &s;afety, at lea&s;t it affords a &s;ign that the complaint has attained the height of its violence. On the contrary, an eruption which &s;hews it&s;elf at an earlier period, which is crouded, and makes its way with difficulty, or which re&s;embles iron-burnt bli&s;ters rather than pu&s;tules pro|perly &s;o called, particularly if it is on the upper lip, and &s;preads towards the no&s;e, affords a general indi|cation of danger and malignancy.&mdash;Small and imper|fect eruptions likewi&s;e are frequently a &s;ign of a te|dious di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of animal heat is another of tho&s;e cir|cum&s;tances, which may be con&s;idered as affording an indication of the nature and event of fevers. Where the heat of the body, in the remitting fever of Jamaica, was equally diffu&s;ed to the extremities,
<PB N="115" REF="028890_0124_0FDE5D5263CD9E70">
or not differing from an increa&s;ed degree of natural warmth, the di&s;ea&s;e was u&s;ually mild, without particular danger or malignity; but where acrid, fiery and pun|gent, though perhaps not much increa&s;ed in degree, danger was apprehended with rea&s;on, particularly if the warmth was not extended equally to every part of the body. In the remi&s;&s;ions of tho&s;e fevers, which were di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;ymptoms of nervous affection, or, as is more commonly believed, putre&s;cent ten|dency, the heat of the body was often &s;everal degrees below the &s;tandard of health. The &s;ymptom was alarming, but it was not in fact of much con&s;equence. This diminution of the heat of the body, during the remi&s;&s;ion, was not by any means a rare occurrence; but be&s;ides this, there was &s;ometimes ob&s;erved a de|gree of coldne&s;s, during the favourable cri&s;is of ner|vous fevers, of a very &s;ingular and extraordinary kind. In &s;ome in&s;tances this coldne&s;s was not infe|rior in degree to that of a per&s;on dying, or actually dead; yet a di&s;tinction was perceived without diffi|culty. It was not accompanied with marks of &s;tric|ture on the &s;urface of the body, at the &s;ame time that the pul&s;e was generally &s;oft, regular and full.</P>
<P>Next to the &s;tate of animal heat it will not be im|proper to con&s;ider the indications of the various kinds of &s;weats. The &s;igns of a favourable &s;weat are commonly known. Where that excretion was fluid, warm and univer&s;al, particularly where accom|panied with a &s;oft, full and expanding pul&s;e, calm and ea&s;y re&s;piration, general relief from &s;ymptoms of di&s;|tre&s;s, with a cheerful eye and countenance, we might in general pre&s;ume on &s;afety of the di&s;ea&s;e, often on its favourable termination. On the contrary, where the &s;weat was cold, clammy and partial, particularly where the pul&s;e became or continued frequent, &s;mall and ten&s;e, with anxiety, re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s and di&s;turbed re|&s;piration, a circum&s;cribed flu&s;hing, a grea&s;y hue of the countenance, or a wild and dejected appearance
<PB N="116" REF="028890_0125_0FDE5C97DE3980C8">
of the eye, the &s;ituation was then alarming:&mdash;death, in &s;hort, was &s;eldom far off. There is, however, an ob&s;ervation with regard to this &s;ubject, which I mu&s;t not omit to mention. Authors, with one con&s;ent, have con&s;idered cold &s;weats as certain mortal &s;igns in fevers; but there appear to be exceptions to this ge|neral rule. I met with &s;everal in&s;tances, while I re|mained in Jamaica, where univer&s;al fluid &s;weats, of an extraordinary degree of coldne&s;s, accompanied the cri&s;is of the di&s;ea&s;e. I was much alarmed when this appearance fir&s;t occurred to me, but my fears &s;oon vani&s;hed, as I found that the pul&s;e became &s;lower and fuller, that the re&s;piration became calm and ea&s;y, and particularly that the eye and countenance acquired &s;uch a cheerfulne&s;s and &s;erenity, as are u&s;ual at the fa|vourable termination of fevers.</P>
<P>To the &s;igns of progno&s;tic, which I have men|tioned above, I &s;hall add tho&s;e which are indicated by the general &s;tate of the vital powers, or by the more particular affection of parts, which are of imme|diate importance to life. Among the fir&s;t of the af|fections of the vital organs, we &s;hall con&s;ider &s;uch in|dications as ari&s;e from a di&s;turbed &s;tate of re&s;piration. A frequent, a hurried and unequal re&s;piration, (I do not &s;peak of that which depends on primary affection of the lungs), is ju&s;tly con&s;idered as a &s;ign of a bad di&s;ea&s;e. This is more certainly the ca&s;e, where ac|companied with deep and heavy &s;ighing. Frequent &s;ighing was a common &s;ymptom in the fevers of Ja|maica, where the powers of life were depre&s;&s;ed; and though not ab&s;olutely a mortal &s;ign, it con&s;tantly in|dicated danger.</P>
<P>Next to the &s;tate of re&s;piration, I &s;hall mention the &s;tate of the intellect, or rea&s;oning faculty, which often afforded &s;ome progno&s;tic of the event of the fever. Delirium, I ob&s;erved before, was a common &s;ymptom in the remitting fever of Jamaica. Where it vani&s;hed or abated as the paroxy&s;m declined, it was &s;eldom
<PB N="117" REF="028890_0126_0FDE5D594A2146E8">
found to be of material con&s;equence. On the con|trary, where it continued during the remi&s;&s;ion undi|mini&s;hed in degree, it was a &s;ymptom of the mo&s;t &s;e|rious nature. I mentioned in a former part of this treati&s;e, that the cau&s;e of fever appeared to act on the brain and nervous &s;y&s;tem, in two general and oppo|&s;ite ways; that is, by occa&s;ioning excitement or de|pre&s;&s;ion. Of the&s;e two modes of action, depre&s;&s;ion was the mo&s;t dangerous; unle&s;s where the excite|ment ran uncommonly high. But though I ob&s;erved, that there are only two general modes of operation, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> excitement and depre&s;&s;ion; yet I mu&s;t al&s;o add, that the modifications are numerous, and very variou&s;ly combined. Among the mo&s;t dangerous and alarm|ing &s;pecies of the derangements of the intellect, we might reckon a &s;tern &s;ullenne&s;s, an unmanageable fu|riou&s;ne&s;s, picking the bed cloaths, tracing figures on the wall, and &s;uch other in&s;tances of perverted judg|ment. Stupor and &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the nervous influ|ence, as we might term it, were likewi&s;e greatly to be dreaded: unle&s;s they &s;hewed them&s;elves only during the time of the paroxy&s;m, they were generally fatal, more certainly &s;o, if they followed convul&s;ions.</P>
<P>As nearly connected with delirium, we &s;hall now con&s;ider other di&s;turbed &s;tates of the functions of the brain, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the &s;tates of re&s;t and watching. We do not expect that &s;leep &s;hould be &s;ound and undi&s;|turbed in fevers; yet we have been accu&s;tomed to think favourably of the di&s;ea&s;e, where the patient is refre&s;hed by it. On the contrary, total want of re&s;t, or unrefre&s;hing &s;lumbers, con&s;tantly indicate danger. There is, however, an a&s;toni&s;hing diver|&s;ity of con&s;titution in this re&s;pect, that mu&s;t always be taken into the account in forming an opinion. Want of &s;leep was ob&s;erved to give ri&s;e to delirium in &s;ome per&s;ons very &s;peedily; others &s;upported it for a great length of time, without any appearance of delirium or &s;pa&s;modic affection. An appearance of
<PB N="118" REF="028890_0127_0FDE5C9E4DF2D4D0">
&s;leeping, without actually enjoying the comforts of &s;leep is well known to be a dangerous &s;ymptom; yet it is not by any means a mortal one. Anxiety and re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, are often referred to the &s;tomach; but re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, and jactitation, as depending on the &s;tate of the nervous &s;y&s;tem, were likewi&s;e frequent, and generally dangerous &s;ymptoms. Tremors of the tongue and of the hands were common appearances in fevers, with marks of nervous affection; but I have likewi&s;e met with in&s;tances, where the whole body &s;hook, when any motion was attempted, not otherwi&s;e than it does in paraly&s;is or chorea &s;ancti+viti. Startings and &s;ub&s;ultus tendinum were not un|common; and they were ju&s;tly con&s;idered as indica|tions of danger; &s;ometimes as forerunners of con|vul&s;ion. A di&s;po&s;ition to faint, even actual faint|ing, was frequent in the fevers of this country. It was always dangerous, though perhaps le&s;s &s;o, than other &s;ymptoms which were le&s;s alarming, particu|larly if it &s;uffered increa&s;e and diminution with the paroxy&s;ms and remi&s;&s;ions of the di&s;ea&s;e. But be&s;ides the&s;e &s;ymptoms, which indicate dimini&s;hed energies, or irregular action of the nervous influence, we may likewi&s;e ob&s;erve, that the &s;phincter mu&s;cles fre|quently lo&s;e their power of contracting, particularly in the advanced periods of fevers. Thus per&s;ons &s;ometimes can only lie upon their back, the eyes and mouth are half open, the powers of &s;peech and &s;wal|lowing are impaired or lo&s;t, and urine and &s;tools pa&s;s off without con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s or again&s;t their will. It is unnece&s;&s;ary to remark, that the&s;e are all &s;ymptoms of the mo&s;t extreme danger. If they proceed from a general and uniform diminution of the powers of life, we may ju&s;tly con&s;ider them as fatal, if they are only produced by a certain mode of action of the febrile cau&s;e, and are remarkably increa&s;ed during the paroxy&s;m, or aggravated by peculiar circum&s;tances of con&s;titution, we &s;hall find many in&s;tances of re|covery.
<PB N="119" REF="028890_0128_0FDE5D5FE9AEAB68">
Thus, I have often &s;een people recover, who could neither &s;peak nor &s;wallow; who did not appear even to di&s;tingui&s;h objects, and who were un|able to retain their urine and &s;tools; or who were not con&s;cious when they pa&s;&s;ed; yet I do not pre|tend to have met with any of the&s;e fortunate events, where the&s;e alarming &s;ymptoms were the con&s;equence of uniform diminution, or general extinction of the vital principle.</P>
<P>From the &s;igns which I have enumerated, &s;epa|rately and collectively con&s;idered, we may in general be able to form &s;ome progno&s;tic of the nature and event of the fevers of Jamaica. If to the&s;e we add tho&s;e indications, which may be taken from the &s;tate of the eye and countenance, we may attain a &s;till more &s;atisfactory knowledge. It is an ob&s;ervation which I have con&s;tantly found to be true, that where the eye and countenance were &s;erene and cheerful, the di&s;ea&s;e was void of any latent malignity, though it might be otherwi&s;e of a dangerous nature. On the contrary, where the appearance of the eye was &s;ad, watery, inflamed, or uncommonly gli&s;tening; where the countenance was of a dreary hue, downca&s;t, dark and clouded; and &s;ometimes where it was of a beau|tiful blooming colour, which was not natural to the patient, there was always rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect danger. But though a &s;erene and cheerful eye and counte|nance are generally indications of &s;afety, I mu&s;t not at the &s;ame time omit to mention, that it &s;ometimes happens in beginning mortifications, or in imperfect or unfavourable cri&s;is, that the eye and countenance a&s;&s;ume, for a &s;hort time, this flattering appearance of &s;erenity and compo&s;ure, though the hour of death is actually approaching fa&s;t. The indications from the eye and countenance are of the greate&s;t importance, in enabling us to form a judgment of the event of fevers; but little of this knowledge is, in fact, com|municable in words. It mu&s;t be drawn, in a great mea&s;ure, from our own ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="028890_0129_0FDE5CA549563688">
I do not pretend that the &s;igns of progno&s;tic, which I have enumerated in the preceding pages, are by any means complete, if referred to fevers in general; but I at the &s;ame time believe, that they are le&s;s defec|tive, if applied more directly to the remitting fever of Jamaica. They were collected at a time when I was not much acquainted with books: and, on that account, I am induced to offer them to the public with more confidence; particularly, as I find that the indications, to which I have principally tru&s;ted, appeared in the &s;ame light to &s;ome authors, who are univer&s;ally con&s;idered as careful ob&s;ervers, and who practi&s;ed in climates, in many re&s;pects, &s;imilar to that of the We&s;t Indies. I have di&s;criminated, as far as was in my power, between the doubtful and more certain appearances of danger or &s;afety; and I hope I have no where advanced any thing, which has a tendency to mi&s;lead the uninformed. I may add, that general knowledge in progno&s;tic goes no farther than a very rude outline, which individuals mu&s;t fill up from their own experience. There are, in fact, few &s;igns in fevers, which are ab&s;olutely deci&s;ive in them|&s;elves; and as the&s;e &s;igns are often variou&s;ly com|bined, &s;o they mu&s;t be &s;eparately and collectively e&s;|timated. It is only from con&s;idering accurately the re&s;ult of the whole, that we can be enabled to &s;peak with confidence.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CRISIS AND SIMPLE REMISSION.</HEAD>
<P>IT is certainly a matter of &s;ome importance, to be able to di&s;tingui&s;h between actual cri&s;is and the &s;imple remi&s;&s;ion of the fever of Jamaica; but it is a matter about which the practitioners of that country did not &s;eem much to concern them&s;elves. A differ|ence undoubtedly exi&s;ts, and the marks of it appeared to me clear and unequivocal in mo&s;t in&s;tances. It was otherwi&s;e in the intermitting fever of America. In the pure intermitting fever of that country, I &s;ome|times gue&s;&s;ed luckily; but I cannot &s;ay po&s;itively, that I ever di&s;covered &s;igns on which I could depend with ab&s;olute certainty, that the fever was gone, not to return again, till the hour of return was pa&s;t. In this di&s;ea&s;e, on the contrary, I &s;hould not expect to be deceived once in a hundred times. Much of this information, however, is too minute to be intelligi|bly explained in words, and therefore can only be ac|quired by actual ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>I &s;hall attempt to enumerate the principal of tho&s;e &s;igns, from which we may be enabled to attain &s;ome knowledge of the difference between actual cri&s;is and temporary remi&s;&s;ion: and in the fir&s;t place I remark, that the tongue was u&s;ually rough and dry, even dur|ing the mo&s;t perfect remi&s;&s;ions of the endemic fever of Jamaica. If it therefore happened, that it a&s;&s;um|ed a &s;mooth and moi&s;t appearance at the end of a pa|roxy&s;m, there generally was rea&s;on to believe that the fever was gone, not to return again. This pre&s;ump|tion was &s;till &s;tronger, where its edges acquired the cherry-like colour of health; and particularly where the coat, with which it was u&s;ually covered, &s;hewed
<PB N="122" REF="028890_0131_0FDE5CAA6C9CD660">
a di&s;po&s;ition to loo&s;en and &s;eparate. It mu&s;t however be remarked, that though the&s;e appearances of the tongue afforded a common mark of the termination of fevers, they did not by any means afford a deci&s;ive one. In&s;tead of cri&s;is, they &s;ometimes only indicated a change in the mode of action of the febrile cau&s;e; they were, in &s;hort, in &s;ome ca&s;es only forerunners of &s;ymptoms of nervous affection, or marks of a change from a continued to a remitting or intermit|ting form. Such are the pre&s;umptions of actual cri|&s;is, which might be drawn from the appearances of the tongue, where the tongue happened to be remark|ably changed from its natural appearance in the pre|ceding cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e. But it al&s;o &s;ometimes happened in ca&s;es of the &s;ingle tertian, where the pa|roxy&s;ms were &s;light, and the remi&s;&s;ions long and per|fect, that the tongue was &s;o little altered by the pre|&s;ence of the fever, as not to afford any certain crite|rion between the remi&s;&s;ion and actual cri&s;is. In &s;ome fevers likewi&s;e of a malignant kind, the tongue was &s;ometimes &s;mooth and moi&s;t, even red and clear on the edges, whil&s;t the di&s;ea&s;e was advancing rapidly. This, however, &s;o far as I have &s;een was con&s;tantly connected with a particular &s;tate of the &s;tomach, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> with nau&s;ea, or with vomitting of a vi&s;cous liquor.</P>
<P>Signs of cri&s;is taken from the pul&s;e alone, were not in general much to be depended upon in the fe|vers of Jamaica; yet, together with other circum|&s;tances, the &s;tate of the pul&s;e might often help us to decide in doubtful &s;ituations. Changes from bad to better, if no &s;ymptoms of comato&s;e affection appeared at the &s;ame time, were generally con&s;idered as indicat|ing cri&s;is, or tendency to cri&s;is, yet it will be le&s;s expected, perhaps, that I &s;hould rank the intermit|ting pul&s;e among the &s;igns, which indicate a favour|able termination of the di&s;ea&s;e. Some in&s;tances of this have occured to me, both in the We&s;t-Indies and in England; but though I mention the fact, I con|fe&s;s my&s;elf unable to offer an explanation of it.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="028890_0132_0FDE5D734D2C1200">
The &s;tate of the &s;kin affords marks more deci&s;ive of the total or temporary ab&s;ence of fever, than the ordinary &s;tate of the pul&s;e. When the &s;weat, which in the preceding remi&s;&s;ions had been partial and im|perfect, became copious, fluid, univer&s;al and of long continuance, there was generally a pre&s;umption of cri&s;is. But independent of the nature of the &s;weat, there is &s;omething in the &s;tate of the &s;kin, &s;omething in the impre&s;&s;ion which it makes on the hand which feels it, very different when the fever has only remit|ted, and when it has terminated finally. Though it may be difficult, perhaps impo&s;&s;ible, to mark this di&s;tinction preci&s;ely in words; yet it is ea&s;ily known to tho&s;e, who accu&s;tom them&s;elves to ob&s;erve minute circum&s;tances with attention. There was, in fact, no indication of that &s;pa&s;modic &s;tricture on the &s;ur|face, which had been ob&s;ervable in the former remi&s;|&s;ions, and we might &s;ay, that the body was per&s;pir|able, even in the extreme parts. It is a circum&s;tance likewi&s;e not a little curious, that the heat of the body, during a cri&s;is, particularly in tho&s;e fevers, which had principally affected the nervous &s;y&s;tem, was &s;ome|times &s;o much below what it u&s;ually is in health, as to be really alarming. In &s;ome in&s;tances, I have found the extremities to be not le&s;s cold, than if the patient had been actually dead; yet this coldne&s;s was of &s;uch a nature, as to be di&s;tingui&s;hed without much difficulty from that which precedes death.</P>
<P>The above is only a very imperfect hi&s;tory of tho&s;e &s;igns, which actually di&s;tingui&s;h the cri&s;is of fever from a &s;imple remi&s;&s;ion. There are &s;till &s;ome others, not le&s;s to be depended upon, perhaps, but which cannot be &s;o ea&s;ily reduced to di&s;tinct de&s;cription.&mdash;Among the&s;e, we may reckon unu&s;ual evacuations upwards or downwards, &s;ound and refre&s;hing &s;leep, where watchfulne&s;s had prevailed through the preced|ing cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, return of natural appetites, decrea&s;e of thir&s;t, loo&s;ening of &s;cabby eruptions, and
<PB N="124" REF="028890_0133_0FDE5CB2EA728420">
above all, a certain expre&s;&s;ion of chearfulne&s;s in the eye and countenance, which though not to be defined in words, conveys to the mind of the ob&s;erver, a &s;trong conviction of what is going forward. This brightne&s;s of the eye was well known to Hippocra|tes, as a &s;alutary &s;ign in fevers; but though it gene|rally affords a very decided indication of a favourable event; yet we mu&s;t be careful to di&s;tingui&s;h from it that clear and gla&s;&s;y appearance, which the eye &s;ome|times acquires previous to death.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. THE GENERAL CURE OF FEVER.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE I attempt to offer rules for the treat|ment of the remitting fever of Jamaica, it will be proper to con&s;ider in the fir&s;t place, how far the cure of the di&s;ea&s;e is the work of nature, and how far it already has been, or hereafter may be accom|pli&s;hed by the exertions of art. The que&s;tion is im|portant, and till its limits are defined, we cannot hope to e&s;tabli&s;h rules of practice on a firm ba&s;is, or to conduct a mode of treatment on a con&s;i&s;tent plan. It will be nece&s;&s;ary however, before entering farther into this &s;ubject, to con&s;ider the power of the vis medicatrix naturae:&mdash;a principle, which under one name or other, has influenced the views of medical men from the earlie&s;t records of phy&s;ic, till the pre|&s;ent times.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION I. OF THE VIS MEDICATRIX NATURAE.</HEAD>
<P>IT is an opinion, which &s;eems either to have been expre&s;sly avowed, or tacitly acknowledged in eve|ry age of the world, that a fever is a combat or ef|fort of nature, to remove from the &s;y&s;tem the derange|ments of a morbid cau&s;e; or in other words, to re|&s;tore a di&s;ea&s;ed body to its ordinary health. It was long believed, that the powers of the con&s;titution made an attempt to concoct the crude and undige&s;ted humours;&mdash;and finally to expel them from the body. But this mode of rea&s;oning is found to be un&s;atisfac|tory:
<PB N="126" REF="028890_0135_0FDE5CB5CC6022F8">
and &s;ome late authors have adopted the idea, that nature directs her efforts towards effecting a &s;o|lution of &s;pa&s;m, on the pre&s;ence and ob&s;tinacy of which the di&s;ea&s;e has been thought, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to depend. It will be a hard ta&s;k to reconcile this difference of opinion, or to &s;ay which is the right one. There are plau&s;ible arguments on both &s;ides of the que&s;tion; and neither &s;uppo&s;ition, perhaps, is accurately true. The coction of humours (as it may be called) is often apparently connected with evident approaches towards a relaxation of &s;pa&s;modic &s;tricture; and increa&s;ed di&s;charges by the different ex|cretories, are obviou&s;ly attendants of its actual &s;olu|tion. Yet though this is certainly true, it &s;till is not clear, that either the coction of the humours, or the &s;olution of the &s;pa&s;m, is the real effect of a regular mechanic operation of the powers of nature, attempt|ing by this means to overcome the de&s;tructive ten|dency of the di&s;ea&s;e. It is even more probable, that the coction of the humours, or &s;olution of the &s;pa&s;m are only circum&s;tances of accident, occa&s;ionally con|nected with certain &s;tates of action of the morbid cau&s;e; but which do not ari&s;e from the regular de&s;ign of nature to accompli&s;h this purpo&s;e. I ju&s;t now ob|&s;erved, that there is a difference of opinion about the mode of operation, which nature employs to combat the effects of the di&s;ea&s;e; but I may add, that no body, as far as I know, attempts to deny the exi&s;tence of &s;uch a principle in the con&s;titution of the frame, as di&s;po&s;es it to re&s;tore its own health by a certain train of regular efforts. On the fir&s;t view of the &s;ubject, indeed, there are many circum&s;tances which give countenance to the opinion. The relief which often follows hemorrhage, &s;weat and other evacuations in unu&s;ual quantity; and &s;till more, the relief, which attends the eruption of the &s;mall pox, or the appear|ance of gout on the extremities, undoubtedly affords a &s;trong pre&s;umptive argument, that nature rai&s;e&s;
<PB N="127" REF="028890_0136_0FDE5D845E3E7E20">
&s;ome active and generally well directed efforts, which remove from the body a cau&s;e that di&s;turbs the ordi|nary functions of health. But though the above cir|cum&s;tances are commonly known, and may be &s;up|po&s;ed to afford an argument in &s;upport of this opinion; yet the fact may perhaps admit of another explanation, while there are other appearances, connected with the &s;ubject, which render the exi&s;tence of this regular de&s;ign of nature very que&s;tionable. When I &s;ay, that I cannot readily allow the vis m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">dicatrix naturae, (in the &s;en&s;e in which it is generally under&s;tood), to be an e&s;tabli&s;hed principle in the con&s;titution of the frame, I am aware, that I incur an imputation of of pre&s;umption. An opinion, venerable from an|tiquity, and &s;upported by many plau&s;ible arguments, might be thought to be &s;ecure from the attacks of a man, who has no profe&s;&s;ional reputation to boa&s;t of: yet as no de&s;ire of novelty has induced me to fabricate a conjecture on a dark &s;ubject, &s;o I humbly hope I may be indulged in my attempt to explain an important truth. The &s;anction of two thou&s;and years, and the authority of the names who &s;upport this doctrine, are formidable opponents; yet I tru&s;t I may be able to prove, that the vis medicatrix naturae does not, as is commonly believed, re&s;tore the health of the body by one general and uniform mode of operation; or that our di&s;ea&s;es are not removed in con&s;equence of a regular de&s;ign in the mechani&s;m of the frame. I &s;hall relate the fact from which I have been led to form this conclu&s;ion; for the refutation or confirma|tion of which, I require no other indulgence than a candid enquiry.</P>
<P>I have ju&s;t now declared, that fever, or the cau&s;e of fever, is not combated and finally overcome by a regular train of active efforts, or a vis medicatrix na|turae; and I mu&s;t ob&s;erve in proof of it, that there were many of the fevers of the We&s;t-Indies, where the di&s;ea&s;e, or the paroxy&s;m of the di&s;ea&s;e, vani&s;hed or
<PB N="128" REF="028890_0137_0FDE5CBF9A962318">
declined, without any exertion on the part of nature being perceiveable. The powers of life, during this period, were in &s;ome degree &s;u&s;pended. The patient, who could only be &s;aid not to be actually dead, was totally in&s;en&s;ible to every object that was near to him; and often did not feel the irritation of acrid &s;ub&s;tances that were applied to him: yet after a certain conti|nuance in this &s;tate, he began to re&s;ume his powers of &s;en&s;ation and motion; and the di&s;ea&s;e at la&s;t &s;ub|&s;ided or vani&s;hed, though the efforts of nature were not di&s;covered; nay, though the vital powers were &s;ometimes in a &s;tate &s;o weakened, as to be apparently very little capable of effort. This fact, which the mo&s;t &s;uperficial ob&s;erver could not ea&s;ily overlook, furni&s;hes &s;ufficient rea&s;on for doubting of the very exi&s;tence of a vis medicatrix naturae; a doubt which is further corroborated, by ob&s;erving the manner in which death frequently approaches in the fevers of Jamaica. It is known, that the &s;ufferings of the pa|tient are &s;ometimes alleviated for a &s;hort time before death. This alleviation, wherever it does take place, happens con&s;tantly at the expected period of cri&s;is. The cau&s;e of it has generally been attributed to the vis medicatrix naturae; that is, to a la&s;t effort of the powers of life; but I have weighed carefully all the circum&s;tances connected with the phenomenon, and cannot readily a&s;&s;ent to the opinion. To indulge in conjectures, is contrary to the principles I profe&s;s; yet I mu&s;t &s;ugge&s;t, that a fever, or the paroxy&s;m of a fever, terminates, &s;trictly &s;peaking, from a hidden &s;omething in the nature of the febrile cau&s;e, from &s;omething which cea&s;es to act, or which changes its mode of action after a certain duration. I do not pretend to explain the manner in which this happens. I only add, that the fact is &s;upported by probabilities. It was frequently ob&s;erved, in &s;uch ca&s;es of fever as terminated fatally, that there was actually a period of time, generally the period immediately preceding a
<PB N="129" REF="028890_0138_0FDE5D8D3A8212B8">
decided fatal termination, where the real pre&s;ence of di&s;ea&s;e was perceived with difficulty. The patient, however, was unable to recover. Death happened in a very few hours, and it &s;eemed to en&s;ue in &s;uch ca&s;es, from one of the following cau&s;es, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> either from the mechani&s;m of a part of vital importance being de&s;troyed; from the powers of nature being too much exhau&s;ted to continue life; or perhaps &s;till oftener, from the recurrence of the di&s;ea&s;e, in another form, &s;peedily putting a period to exi&s;tence, while the vital principle was in this weakened &s;tate. But though the circum&s;tances, which I have mentioned, afford grounds for believing that a fever, or the pa|roxy&s;m of a fever, is not actually removed from the body, &s;olely by the efforts of a vis medicatrix naturae; yet if we choo&s;e to proceed further in the inve&s;tiga|tion, it will be no difficult ta&s;k to involve this opinion, which has hitherto been con&s;idered almo&s;t as &s;acred, in &s;till greater perplexity. If we admit of the exi&s;t|ence of a vis medicatrix naturae, it will not be ea&s;y to conceive, how a fever, which has once been expel|led from the body, &s;hould return again in a given time, or how the alternate paroxy&s;ms of the double tertian, for in&s;tance, &s;hould be of &s;uch different duration or of &s;uch different degrees of violence in the &s;ame per|&s;on; neither can we under&s;tand, how a fever of one kind &s;hould la&s;t only &s;even days, another fourteen, and another twenty, or longer:&mdash;circum&s;tances which hap|pen daily, without the lea&s;t apparent connexion with the innate vigour of con&s;titution. We &s;hall be equally puz|zled likewi&s;e, if we attempt to explain on the &s;uppo&s;i|tion of this principle, how a fever &s;hould continue, while the powers of the con&s;titution are vigorous and &s;trong, and cea&s;e when they are apparently exhau&s;ted. The above are well known facts, and do not leave any room to doubt, that the termination of fever, or of the paroxy&s;m of fever, depends on &s;ome other principle be&s;ides the mere efforts of the vis medicatrix

naturae. Whether this re&s;ides, as was hinted before, in a hidden modification of the nature of the cau&s;e, which cea&s;es to act, or changes its mode of action af|ter a certain duration; or whether, combined with this, the con&s;tant but imperceptible changes, which are continually going on in the &s;y&s;tem, de&s;troy in the frame of the individual, that particular &s;tate of apti|tude to the febrile cau&s;e, in which the di&s;ea&s;e con&s;i&s;ts, we cannot determine with certainty; yet it would be ob&s;tinate to maintain any longer, that the cure of fe|ver is owing to general and well directed efforts of nature, expelling a morbific matter or overcoming a prevailing &s;pa&s;m. It is true, that an obvious &s;olution of &s;pa&s;modic &s;tricture, or the appearance of a morbid matter on the le&s;s important parts of the body, u&s;ually attend the favourable termination of fevers; yet the&s;e circum&s;tances are, in fact, attendants rather than cau&s;es of cri&s;is. I do not deny, that increa&s;ed di&s;|charges by different outlets, &s;ometimes moderate the violence of fever during its continuance, as well as attend its final &s;olution; yet it has not, nor perhaps can it ever be demon&s;trated, that this proceeds from a regular de&s;ign of nature.</P>
<P>The hints which have been thrown out in the pre|ceding pages, give room for &s;uppo&s;ing that the vis me|dicatrix naturae, in the &s;en&s;e in which it is u&s;ually under&s;tood by medical writers, is only a principle of doubtful exi&s;tence in the con&s;titution of the frame; yet though this is certainly true, I do not pretend to deny, that the animal machine is endued with a power, which re&s;i&s;ts, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the derangements of a de&s;troying cau&s;e, and which per&s;i&s;ts to a certain de|gree in continuing the action of living. The gene|ral nature of the cau&s;e of fever, or the nature of its various modifications is a my&s;tery, which we do not as yet know. We only know, that when pre&s;ent in a certain &s;tate of vigour and activity, it deranges or di&s;turbs the actions and functions of the &s;y&s;tem;&mdash;
<PB N="131" REF="028890_0140_0FDE5D960E74E1C8">
while we likewi&s;e know, that it does not always di&s;|turb every action or every function in the &s;ame de|gree. It has occurred too often to have e&s;caped the mo&s;t &s;uperficial ob&s;ervation, that where one part of the body &s;uffers particularly, the others are often re|lieved in proportion. We frequently in this manner ob&s;erve, that general fever is dimini&s;hed by the ap|pearance of local pain; or, on the contrary, in|crea&s;ed by its removal. It likewi&s;e often happens from the &s;ame principle, that where the &s;tomach and biliary &s;y&s;tem &s;uffer much, there is le&s;s di&s;order in the other parts: and on the other hand, that where the&s;e &s;ufferings are removed or mitigated, the general fever runs higher, and often continues high, till the &s;ame, or other local affections, are again produced. Thus, though we are totally ignorant of the intimate nature of the cau&s;e of fever, we &s;till perceive very plainly, that it either po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;omething in its own nature, or accidentally meets with &s;omething in the con&s;titu|tion of the individual, which determines it to affect the different parts of the body in an unequal degree. It u&s;ually exerts its greate&s;t force upon parts, which are preternaturally weakened by the general influ|ence of climate, &s;ea&s;on, &s;ituation, or other accidental ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;es. Hence bilious appearances are common in the hot months of hot climates, pneumonic affection in cold and dry weather, greater degrees of va&s;cular excitement among the temperate and more active races of men; while &s;ymptoms of nervous affection prevail among the luxurious and enfeebled. The above, with other &s;pecies of the increa&s;ed action of the cau&s;e of fever on a particular part of the body, depend wholly, perhaps, on circum&s;tances of acci|dent; yet it has &s;o happened, that tho&s;e irregular de|terminations have unfortunately been con&s;idered as the efforts, which nature employs to expel from the body a cau&s;e, which di&s;turbs the economy of health. I &s;hall not, at pre&s;ent, go &s;o far as to contend, that
<PB N="132" REF="028890_0141_0FDE5CD06A2C6EB8">
the&s;e determinations are not, in fact, intentions of nature; but &s;hall only beg leave to &s;ugge&s;t, if they actually are intentions, that it is mere chance which determines whether they are &s;alutary or fatal. It is a truth which nobody will deny, where the force of the di&s;ea&s;e is accidentally directed to an organ of excre|tion, or to a part of little importance to life, that the re&s;t of the body is often proportionally relieved, and even that a recovery of general health is &s;ometimes the con&s;equence; yet the contrary is the effect, where the functions of the part, upon which the force of the fever has been thus accidentally diverted, are of im|mediate importance to the action of living. The Gout, a di&s;ea&s;e, the cau&s;e of which bears no very re|mote analogy to the cau&s;e of fever, may be adduced as affording an illu&s;tration of this truth. The proxi|mate cau&s;e of gout, is equally hid from us as the proximate cau&s;e of fever. We know, however, that the one equally with the other, has a tendency to de|&s;troy life. We likewi&s;e know, that there is a power or principle in the con&s;titution, which to a certain degree re&s;i&s;ts de&s;truction. The nature of this power, however, is unknown. We are not only in the dark with regard to its nature; but we can only form con|jectures about the part where it principally re&s;ides.&mdash;We, however, clearly perceive its force and activity to be different in different parts of the body. We may next be allowed to remark, that where the cau&s;e of gout is in a certain &s;tate of modification, tumults, (which properly enough may be termed re-action), ari&s;e in the &s;y&s;tem, and go on to continue till this cau&s;e or hurtful matter finds an outlet from the body, or a lodgment on one particular part. The outlets from the body are numerous: the parts on which the gout &s;eems principally to fix its &s;eat, are the extre|mities, where the power of re&s;i&s;tance is &s;malle&s;t.&mdash;The vital principle, however, becomes weaker as man advances in years; and the cau&s;e of the di&s;order
<PB N="133" REF="028890_0142_0FDE5D9DEA5CECC8">
&s;eems then frequently to find accommodations in parts, which are le&s;s remote from the &s;ources of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. This more e&s;pecially is the ca&s;e, where tone and vigour have been preternaturally weakened. Hence the &s;to|mach, the bowels, &s;ometimes the brain, and even the heart it&s;elf &s;uffer from the immediate action of this di&s;ea&s;e, in the latter periods of life. But though no per&s;on perhaps will deny, that the cau&s;e of gout finds readie&s;t accommodation, (if I may &s;o apply the term) in tho&s;e parts of the body, where the vital powers are naturally weak, or have been accidentally weak|ened from various cau&s;es; yet we may add, that it is likewi&s;e removed from the parts, on which it has been thus fixed, by &s;uch applications as excite their active powers; or, in other words, which call forth the local re-action of the &s;y&s;tem. We may al&s;o ob|&s;erve, that tumults ari&s;e in the general &s;y&s;tem, in con&s;equence of this repre&s;&s;ion or repul&s;ion of the mor|bid cau&s;e from a particular part; and that they do not in general cea&s;e, till an outlet is opened, or ac|commodation found in &s;ome other parts of the body. The above appearances, occur daily in the hi&s;tory of gout. They &s;eem to bear a &s;trong analogy to tho&s;e irregular determinations, which frequently take place in fevers, and their cau&s;e perhaps is the &s;ame. We do not perceive any other law by which they can be explained, than the natural or adventitious &s;tate of activity of the powers of life, which re&s;i&s;t de&s;truction with unequal force in the different parts of the &s;y&s;|tem: &s;o that we &s;hall be obliged to conclude, that tho&s;e &s;ufferings, which have hitherto been &s;tyled the efforts of nature, are in reality more of the pa&s;&s;ive, than of the active kind.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tances which I have now mentioned, combat the very exi&s;tence of the opinion, which has been commonly received with regard to the vis me|dicatrix naturae. I have hinted, that the extent and limits of that principle are narrow, and that the &s;a|lutary
<PB N="134" REF="028890_0143_0FDE5CDA59A500A0">
effects are accidental. I &s;hall next endeavour to &s;hew, that they cannot, without danger, be made the ba&s;is of the general plan of cure in febrile di&s;|ea&s;es. The ta&s;k is important, but the attempt may be thought pre&s;umptuous, as an opinion, contrary to that which I advance, has obtained almo&s;t the uni|ver&s;al con&s;ent of mankind. I have no de&s;ire of changing names, or of making di&s;tinctions, where there is in fact no difference. I perfectly acquie&s;ce in retaining the word vis medicatrix naturae, pro|vided it is limitted to a certain mode of re-action, or to a power in the con&s;titution of re&s;i&s;ting de&s;truction unequally in its different parts, in con&s;equence of which, irregular determinations &s;ometimes prove &s;a|lutary by accident; yet I mu&s;t add, that if we mean to denote by this term a &s;y&s;tem of laws, which have the be&s;t directed tendency to remove from the body a cau&s;e which de&s;troys health, and endangers life, the opinion has a very uncertain foundation. There are few per&s;ons &s;o ignorant, or &s;o blindly devoted to the doctrines of <GAP DESC="foreign"> as not to own, that the u&s;ual|ly reputed efforts of nature, are often ill directed, &s;ometimes pernicious: in &s;hort, that they are obvi|ou&s;ly the cau&s;es of death. The truth of this ob&s;er|vation cannot be denied, and unfortunately it obliges the advocates of the vis medicatrix naturae, to grant the conclu&s;ion, that the laws of the principle are im|perfect. The works of the author of nature, as far as our limited knowledge can trace them, are univer|&s;ally without defect, if examined according to the plan on which they have been originally formed. If they appear otherwi&s;e, it becomes us to he&s;itate, before we decide. We may not have comprehended the fundamental principle of the de&s;ign; but we revolt from the idea, that the execution would be left im|perfect, had it been intended by the Author of our being, that the mechani&s;m of the frame would be &s;uch, as &s;hould oppo&s;e and remove, in the mo&s;t
<PB N="135" REF="028890_0144_0FDE5DA90FC58190">
effectual manner, the derangements of the morbid cau&s;e. Defect and imperfection can have no place in the works of the Almighty. Had it actually been in the original de&s;ign of our Creator, that the hu|man body &s;hould be provided with a &s;y&s;tem of the be&s;t concerted laws for re&s;toring its health, when de|ranged by the numerous cau&s;es of di&s;ea&s;es, as it is impious to &s;uppo&s;e, that tho&s;e laws could be defec|tive; &s;o we may rea&s;onably conclude, that the effects of fevers would not then have been fatal. We find however, that fevers, as well as other di&s;ea&s;es, are fatal to people of all ages and de&s;criptions: and that nature's intentions of cure, if they really are inten|tions, are often de&s;tructive to her&s;elf. I need &s;carce|ly remind the reader of examples of their pernicious tendency. Vomitting, &s;weating, increa&s;ed di&s;charges by &s;tool, &amp;c. are generally con&s;idered as the &s;alutary efforts of nature: but in&s;tances are numerous, where the exce&s;s of tho&s;e evacuations have obviou&s;ly proved the cau&s;es of death. In the &s;ame manner, ab&s;ce&s;&s;es, which in the remote parts of the body, &s;ome|times attend, and even &s;ometimes perhaps influ|ence the favourable termination of fevers; in the brain, or in other organs of importance, are no le&s;s certainly the cau&s;e which de&s;troys life. In both in|&s;tances the de&s;ign of nature, if it can be called a de&s;ign, is the &s;ame. The force of the di&s;ea&s;e being turned principally upon one part, the re&s;t of the body is in a great mea&s;ure relieved from its &s;ufferings;&mdash;but the health and &s;tructure of the part are hurt or de&s;troyed by the change; and it depends wholly upon the accidental importance of the organ, upon which this diver&s;ion has been made, whether death or re|covery is the con&s;equence. Thus it often happens, that the reputed indications of nature prove the im|mediate cau&s;es which de&s;troy the exi&s;tence of the in|dividual; a fact not reconcileable, with the infinite power and wi&s;dom of the Author of our being.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="028890_0145_0FDE5CE328070260">
I have in&s;inuated, that the efforts of nature are uncertain and precarious. They depend on acci|dental determinations to different parts of the body; and I may add, that if we endeavour to inve&s;tigate the cau&s;e, which directs the mechani&s;m of the frame, to adopt one &s;pecies of effort, or one mode of deter|mination in preference to another, we &s;hall not per|haps be able to find any other, than a difference in the &s;tates of the powers of life, which re&s;i&s;t de&s;truc|tion with unequal degrees of force in the different parts of the body. Where there is the lea&s;t re&s;i&s;t|ance, either from the natural or accidental circum|&s;tances of the con&s;titution, there the di&s;ea&s;e mo&s;t ob|viou&s;ly exerts its greate&s;t force. Hence we are &s;ufficiently warranted to conclude, that though the &s;tructure of the human body is perfect with re&s;pect to every purpo&s;e for which it is intended, being only endued with a principle, which re&s;i&s;ts de&s;truction, or per&s;i&s;ts in continuing life to a certain degree; yet that it is extremely defective, if we con&s;ider it as a machine furni&s;hed with a &s;y&s;tem of laws, which have an invariable and well directed tendency to re|&s;tore health by the mo&s;t judicious and rational efforts. The re&s;toration of health, in con&s;equence of this re-action, or irregular determination which takes place in the &s;y&s;tem, is only a circum&s;tance of acci|dent.

<HEAD>SECTION II. OF THE GENERAL INDICATIONS OF CURE IN FEVERS.</HEAD>
<P>THE vis medicatrix naturae, has been hitherto e&s;teemed a principle of much importance in the cure of febrile di&s;ea&s;es. I have attempted to ex|plain
<PB N="137" REF="028890_0146_0FE16FB606666998">
its real limits and extent; but am afraid I may not have done it &s;atisfactorily. A tumult which, properly enough perhaps, may be termed a reaction of the &s;y&s;tem, evidently takes place in con&s;equence of the application of a morbid cau&s;e; but there &s;eems to be little rea&s;on for believing, that this reaction points out the be&s;t method of cure, or wholly by it&s;elf accompli&s;hes this important bu&s;ine&s;s. But though the reputed efforts of nature are thus defec|tive in accompli&s;hing the cure of fevers; yet I do not deny, that there is a general tendency in fevers, or in the paroxy&s;m of fevers, to terminate in a given time, often by a fixed and regular mode of termina|tion. We do not, however, by any means compre|hend the cau&s;e upon which this depends. From the &s;imilarity in the progre&s;s and termination of epidemics, as well as from the &s;teadine&s;s with which various &s;orts of fevers pur&s;ue their cour&s;e, in &s;pite of the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite modes of treatment, we are led to con|clude, that there is &s;omething peculiar in the modi|fication of the cau&s;e, which influences the duration of the di&s;ea&s;e. This at pre&s;ent, is unknown; perhaps is a knowledge which we cannot attain; yet if we take pains to ob&s;erve the cour&s;e of fevers with atten|tion, we may di&s;cover &s;ome rules of practical u&s;e. We know that one &s;pecies of febrile di&s;ea&s;es, ob&s;ti|nately pur&s;ues its cour&s;e, notwith&s;tanding every en|deavour to oppo&s;e it; while another is &s;o totally under our management, as to be &s;topt &s;hort at plea&s;ure with almo&s;t infallible certainty. It thus happens, that the intermittent is perfectly under our controul. Over the continued, and even over the remitting fever of Jamaica, I am afraid, we &s;hall be obliged to confe&s;s, that we po&s;&s;e&s;s no very certain power.&mdash;But I &s;hall examine this &s;ubject more particularly.</P>
<P>When I fir&s;t arrived in Jamaica, in the year 1774, I found that the practitioners of that country very generally believed, that the cour&s;e of the ordi|nary
<PB N="138" REF="028890_0147_0FDE5DB0CA0C8E38">
endemic fever was checked with great certainty by the powers of Peruvian bark. This opinion, in|deed, is found in every medical book, and it appeared frequently, on the fir&s;t view of the &s;ubject, to be well founded. No great &s;pace of time, however, elap&s;ed before &s;ome circum&s;tances were ob&s;erved, which pre&s;ented the matter in a different light. I found in many in&s;tances, that bark was given in the fir&s;t remi&s;&s;ion, or on the &s;econd day of the di&s;ea&s;e; in others, it was not given till the third remi&s;&s;ion, or till the &s;ixth day from the beginning of the complaint; and in &s;ome again, the fever di&s;appeared altogether before a &s;ingle grain of this remedy had been admi|ni&s;tered. I was particularly exact in marking the time or the period of the di&s;ea&s;e, at which the bark was begun to be given, as al&s;o the quantity which was taken upon the whole. The re&s;ult was not &s;uch as might have been expected. Notwith&s;tanding the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite modes of treatment, the di&s;ea&s;e ap|peared to terminate or change about the &s;ame periods in almo&s;t every patient. This fact was confirmed in numerous in&s;tances; and it &s;eems to afford a very un|equivocal proof, that bark, in the quantity in which it is commonly pre&s;cribed in the We&s;t Indies, has not the effects which are <HI>u&s;ually</HI> a&s;cribed to it. I do not, however, infer, that this remedy may not be ca|pable, with more deci&s;ive modes of management, of effecting all that has been expected from it. I had not, during the time that I remained in Jamaica, any conception that the &s;tomach could have retained, or that it would have been &s;afe to have ventured upon the quantities of bark, which I afterwards gave to others, or took my&s;elf in the intermitting fever of America. Two &s;cruples or a drachm, every two hours, is in fact only a &s;mall do&s;e. To this under do&s;e, during &s;hort remi&s;&s;ions, we might perhaps impute the failure of that remedy in the fevers of the We&s;t Indies. That this actually is the ca&s;e, is confirmed

in &s;ome degree, by an in&s;tance which I find recorded among my notes. A young man was &s;eized with a fever, about the middle of Augu&s;t, which &s;hewed marks of great violence from the beginning. Bark was given early, and in larger quantity than cu&s;|tomary. The la&s;t paroxy&s;m of the di&s;ea&s;e, was in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;u&s;pended, in con&s;equence of this pro|ceeding; yet, except that the marks of external fever were ob&s;cure, the patient remained, as u&s;ual, unea&s;y and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, till the period at which the cri&s;is was expected; when the marks of final termi|nation &s;hewed them&s;elves di&s;tinctly. This is the only ca&s;e I met with, where the paroxy&s;ms of the fever of Jamaica were &s;topt, or &s;u&s;pended by the bark; or where external marks of fever vani&s;hed without evident &s;igns of cri&s;is. It affords only a doubtful proof of the power, which this remedy has been &s;uppo&s;ed to po&s;&s;e&s;s, of ab&s;olutely cutting &s;hort the cour&s;e of the endemic of that country. But though the bark was &s;eldom efficacious in abruptly cutting &s;hort the cour&s;e of this di&s;ea&s;e, it is no more than ju&s;tice to remark, that it is a remedy which was almo&s;t every where &s;afe, and that it was ultimately u&s;eful in promoting the cure. It imparted in mo&s;t in&s;tances, where it was employed, a degree of tone and vigour to the &s;y&s;tem&mdash;a certain &s;omething to the con|&s;titution; in con&s;equence of which, the cri&s;is, which we &s;hould have expected to be only partial or imper|fect, became decided and final. I have &s;ugge&s;ted tho&s;e few remarks, with regard to the virtues of Peru|vian bark in the common endemic of Jamaica; if its effects are &s;o very doubtful in this di&s;ea&s;e, we have no rea&s;on to expect, that they will be more cer|tain in fevers of a more continued kind.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides bark, the power of which appears to be very precarious, other remedies have been employed by phy&s;icians, with the view of cutting &s;hort the cour&s;e of fevers.&mdash;Antimony, under one form or

other, has been celebrated for this intention, &s;ince its fir&s;t introduction into medicine. James's Powder is the mo&s;t famous, and perhaps the mo&s;t effectual antimonial preparation, which, as yet, has been of|fered to the public. I am &s;orry to &s;ay, that I had not an opportunity of making proper trial of it, in the fevers of the We&s;t-Indies; but I can add, that the emetic tartar was often found to be dangerous, &s;carcely ever effectual in cutting &s;hort the cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, unle&s;s given at an early period, or before the fever had a&s;&s;umed a proper form. Its <HI>virtues,</HI> as a febrifuge, were heightened by the addition of opium and camphire, I am &s;orry al&s;o to remark, that I can|not &s;peak with confidence of the virtues of James's Powder, in the intermitting fever of America. Eme|tic tartar was frequently employed, but it did not by any means an&s;wer the expectations which were enter|tained of it. I acknowledge, that it might be &s;o managed, as apparently to prevent the return of a particular paroxy&s;m; but the in&s;tances, where it com|pletely removed the di&s;ea&s;e, were &s;o rare, that I do not con&s;ider it as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of very eminent virtues. I have had frequent opportunities, &s;ince my return to Britain, of trying James's Powder in the conti|nued fevers of this country; and the re&s;ult of my experience inclines me to believe, that this remedy, when given at an early period, has &s;ometimes actu|ally carried off the di&s;ea&s;e. It appeared likewi&s;e, when exhibited near the critical periods, to render the cri&s;is more complete; but I have little cau&s;e for thinking, that it ever cut &s;hort a fever in the mid&s;t of its cour&s;e. Thus it appears, that the&s;e two cele|brated remedies,&mdash;bark and the various preparations of antimony, are, in fact, le&s;s effectual in cutting &s;hort the cour&s;e of febrile di&s;ea&s;es, than has been com|monly &s;uppo&s;ed; I cannot, however, abandon the idea that the purpo&s;e, which has been expected from the&s;e remedies, may &s;till be obtained by other means.
<PB N="141" REF="028890_0150_0FDE5DCA946FAC98">
Galen mentions &s;ome in&s;tances, where he extingui&s;h|ed the fever by copious evacuations: authors men|tion many, and I have my&s;elf &s;een &s;ome, where drink|ing plentifully of the colde&s;t water, produced the &s;ame effects. The alternate u&s;e of warm and cold bathing occa&s;ions great changes in the &s;tate of the con&s;titu|tion: and from the trials, which I have made of the&s;e applications, I do not entertain a doubt, that they may be &s;o managed, as to &s;horten very materially the du|ration of fevers. I do not however promi&s;e, that they are capable of being &s;o conducted, as infallibly at once to &s;top the di&s;ea&s;e in its progre&s;s. This can only be accompli&s;hed by tho&s;e great and remarkable changes, which de&s;troy a certain aptitude, in the &s;tate of the &s;y&s;tem, to the morbid cau&s;e, in which the di&s;|ea&s;e is &s;uppo&s;ed to con&s;i&s;t. But I mu&s;t at the &s;ame time confe&s;s, that as we neither know the nature of this aptitude, nor the particular nature of remote cau&s;es, &s;o every attempt of cure on this plan, as it mu&s;t be at random, cannot be adopted without danger. It is a view, therefore, which will not be pro&s;ecuted with &s;afety, while our knowledge of the nature of morbid cau&s;es, and of the laws and &s;tructure of the human frame, is &s;o imperfect.</P>
<P>It is evident from the facts which I have related in the preceding pages, that we cannot &s;afely tru&s;t the cure of fevers to tho&s;e tumults, or irregular de|terminations in the &s;y&s;tem, which are u&s;ually &s;tyled the efforts of nature: neither does it appear, that we can depend on the efficacy of any one remedy, we are yet acquainted with, as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the power of abruptly cutting &s;hort their cour&s;e. We &s;till how|ever perceive, that the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es have a general ten|dency to terminate in a given time and &s;teadily to go through a regular progre&s;s, in &s;pite of the greate&s;t exertions of art. If we review the practice which medical people have followed in fevers, from the days of Hippocrates to the pre&s;ent times, we meet with &s;uch contradictory methods of treatment, as render
<PB N="142" REF="028890_0151_0FDE5DD22B20E4C0">
it impo&s;&s;ible to avoid pronouncing, that if one man had actually &s;aved life, another's endeavours &s;eemed as if intended to de&s;troy it: yet few authors have ventured to offer the fruits of their labours to the public, without previou&s;ly boa&s;ting more &s;ucce&s;sful methods of cure, than were known to their prede|ce&s;&s;ors. Hence, if we are not &s;ometimes di&s;po&s;ed to doubt their veracity, we can hardly avoid concluding, that their practice had been feeble, and of &s;mall effect. We lament, with rea&s;on, that medical facts are fre|quently of little value: nay, that they oftener mi&s;lead, than guide us in the way to truth. An overfondne&s;s for our&s;elves is, perhaps, more the cau&s;e of this, than real want of candour; the natural propen&s;ity of the human mind to flatter it&s;elf, di&s;po&s;ing us to attribute cures to remedies, which were admini&s;tered near the critical periods of the di&s;ea&s;e; while twenty in&s;tances, where &s;imilar treatment produced no apparent effect, are in&s;en&s;ibly blotted from the memory. This at lea&s;t was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he ca&s;e with my&s;elf. I flattered my&s;elf in many in&s;tances, that I had actually &s;aved life:&mdash;I now find, on maturer reflection, that I had in reality done no material good. Thus it frequently happens, I believe, that practitioners boa&s;t of cures, to which they have no right; at the &s;ame time I am convinced, that they are frequently charged with deaths, of which they are innocent. The life of man does not appear to depend upon &s;o &s;mall a matter, in febrile di&s;ea&s;es, as is generally imagined; and is not often pre&s;erved or endangered by the routine of common practice. It is not always ea&s;y to know exactly the real effects of treatment; neither has the road, which leads to this knowledge, been pur&s;ued with &s;ufficient indu&s;try. Fevers occur frequently, and on that very account, have been traced le&s;s minutely in their cour&s;e, than &s;ome other di&s;ea&s;es. There are few practitioners, who write down in the pre&s;ence of the &s;ick, a minute and accurate hi&s;tory of the various ca&s;es of fe|vers, which come under their care; who ob&s;erve
<PB N="143" REF="028890_0152_0FDE5DD9E878EA88">
carefully the changes which happen from day to day; who note the particular methods of cure, and the ef|fects which ari&s;e in con&s;equence of every alteration of treatment. Yet, unle&s;s all the&s;e circum&s;tances are attentively con&s;idered, we cannot hope to form con|clu&s;ions, which are in any degree to be depended upon. If we defer making remarks till the patient recovers or dies, difficulties will be ea&s;ily got over, and &s;uch facts as contradict opinions, in which we have long believed, will be more ea&s;ily reconciled, as being le&s;s perfectly remembered. Hence it is that a man may continue a very exten&s;ive practice, for a very long life, without ever once getting a view of the real truth.</P>
<P>As from what has been &s;aid before, little doubt can remain of the precariou&s;ne&s;s of tru&s;ting the cure of fevers to the &s;imple efforts of nature; or, if we except intermittents, to the efficacy of particular remedies which cut off their cour&s;e abruptly, it remains to look out for &s;ome other principle, which may &s;erve us as a guide in the conduct of our practice. It is a truth to which we may accede without he&s;itation, that the cau&s;e of fever, as I have mentioned before, whatever it is, or however modified, has a general tendency to de&s;troy the powers of life; while we likewi&s;e know, that there is a principle in the mechani&s;m of the frame, which re&s;i&s;ts de&s;truction to a certain degree. We al&s;o know, that the cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e differs in de|gree of force; and that it is differently modified ac|cording to various circum&s;tances; as we likewi&s;e ob|&s;erve, that the principle of life, or power of re&s;i&s;tance, is different in activity, in the different parts of the body. To the&s;e two powers, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> force of the morbid cau&s;e and the powers of the con&s;titution our views in practice mu&s;t be principally directed. Hence we may e&s;tabli&s;h a general rule, that wherever the force of the morbid cau&s;e is weak; at the &s;ame time that the powers of life in the general &s;y&s;tem, and particularly in the organs of vital importance, are
<PB N="144" REF="028890_0153_0FDE5DDF702FE060">
&s;trong and active, we have nothing more to do than to look on. On the contrary, where the cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e is of unu&s;ual force, or where the powers of life are preternaturally weak, our interference ought to be &s;peedy, bold and decided. In other words, we leave the bu&s;ine&s;s chiefly to nature, or take it entirely out of her hands. It is this which a practitioner mu&s;t fir&s;t determine, when called upon to give his a&s;&s;i&s;tance to a patient labouring under a fever. If the powers of the con&s;titution appear to be equal to the ta&s;k, our interference would be officious, and perhaps might prove hurtful. If a&s;&s;i&s;tance is nece&s;&s;ary, it ought to be our principal aim to render it complete; but in pro&s;ecuting this view, we meet with much difficulty and impediment. We are not yet acquainted with any one remedy, which has a certain and infallible power of cutting &s;hort fevers in the mid&s;t of their cour&s;e. It is not therefore ab&s;olutely in our power to take the bu&s;ine&s;s entirely out of the hands of nature. We can, in fact, go no farther, than to oppo&s;e her pernicious efforts; or to obviate the fatal tendencies of the di&s;ea&s;e. The fatal tendencies of the di&s;ea&s;e, are variou&s;ly modified, and the means by which they mu&s;t be obviated, are &s;ometimes directly oppo&s;ite. Two general modes, however, of the fatal action of fevers may in mo&s;t in&s;tances be di&s;covered. The cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, in one ca&s;e, exerts its influence on the &s;ources of life and motion; in the other, the &s;tructure of an organ of le&s;s importance is de&s;troyed, and death happens only from a &s;econdary effect. There is perhaps no fundamental difference in the&s;e different modes of action; yet the indications of cure, which ari&s;e from this view, are totally oppo&s;ite. In the fir&s;t in&s;tance, it is nece&s;&s;ary to excite, and to &s;up|port the general powers of life: an indication of very great extent. In the other, it is &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;ary to dimini&s;h the general reaction of the &s;y&s;tem; to obviate irregular determination, and to oppo&s;e with vigour the tumultuary efforts of nature.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. OF THE PARTICULAR CURE OF THE FEVER OF JAMAICA.</HEAD>
<P>I SHALL begin this &s;ubject with ob&s;erving, that the fever, which prevailed in the di&s;trict of Savanna la Mar, was naturally a di&s;ea&s;e of the remitting kind; yet circum&s;tances were &s;ometimes connected with it, in &s;uch a manner as prevented it from a&s;&s;uming its proper form. To remove tho&s;e circum&s;tances, which thus ma&s;ked or concealed the real genius of the di&s;ea&s;e, was con&s;idered as the fir&s;t &s;tep towards a cure. The accompli&s;hment of this purpo&s;e, however, was &s;ometimes difficult; neither could it always be effect|ed by the &s;ame means. Thus it happened frequently in ca&s;es, where there was exce&s;s of excitement, or a high degree of inflammatory diathe&s;is, that the re|mi&s;&s;ions where &s;carcely perceptible; as it was likewi&s;e ob&s;erved, that where there was a want of reaction, the paroxy&s;ms were often languid and ob&s;cure. In the one ca&s;e, the remi&s;&s;ions di&s;covered them&s;elves in con|&s;equence of bleeding, dilution and copious evacuation; in the other, wine and cordials determined the di&s;ea&s;e to a&s;&s;ume its proper genuine form.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, evacuations were u&s;ually em|ployed as the means of procuring remi&s;&s;ion, where the inflammatory diathe&s;is prevailed in exce&s;s; I may add, that they were proper for the mo&s;t part, and that they &s;eldom failed of producing the effect. Bleeding was frequently nece&s;&s;ary, and generally of &s;ervice. Its efficacy, however, was often heightened by particular modes of management. Thus relaxation of &s;pa&s;ms, and
<PB N="146" REF="028890_0155_0FDE5DF4A9CB5F10">
removal of inflammatory diathe&s;is, more certainly fol|lowed bleeding, if the blood was drawn from a large orifice; if the patient was placed in an erect po&s;ture, during the operation; and more certainly &s;till, if the lower extremities were at the &s;ame time immer&s;ed in warm water. When bleeding had been premi&s;ed, and repeated according to the circum&s;tances and ur|gency of the ca&s;e, it was then cu&s;tomary to open the body freely: for which purpo&s;e, I have not found any thing an&s;wer better, than a thin &s;olution of Glauber or Ep&s;om Salts, with a &s;mall portion of emetic tartar. The operation of this medicine was exten&s;ive. It might be &s;o managed as to occa&s;ion nau&s;ea, or mode|rate vomiting; to operate bri&s;kly downwards, or to promote a gentle diaphore&s;is. Remi&s;&s;ions were ge|nerally the con&s;equence of this method of proceeding, where there was no defect in the manner of conduct|ing it. But where it it &s;o happened, that the circum|&s;tances of the patient forbad the u&s;e of this laxative; or where it might not be proper to carry it to a &s;uf|ficient length, benefit was derived from a powder, compo&s;ed of nitre, camphire, emetic tartar and opium, given in pretty large do&s;es, and repeated frequently. Remi&s;&s;ion, at lea&s;t a great abatement in the violence of &s;ymptoms, was generally the con&s;equence of this plan of treatment; particularly, if a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the plen|tiful dilution of watery liquors, by warm bathing and by large gly&s;ters of &s;imple water. It is &s;uperfluous to mention the u&s;e of bli&s;ters in ca&s;es of local affec|tion; but it will be le&s;s expected, that this remedy &s;hould be recommended in fevers, where there is an exce&s;s of the general inflammatory diathe&s;is.&mdash;I can, however, bear te&s;timony to its efficacy. The manner by which bli&s;ters produce their effects, is not yet agreed upon among authors; neither do I pretend to throw any new light upon the &s;ubject; but I would beg leave to &s;ugge&s;t, that the mode of affording re|lief in the pre&s;ent, at lea&s;t, did not &s;eem to be much
<PB N="147" REF="028890_0156_0FDE5DFAE4904A60">
unlike the effect of local affections, in con&s;equence of which the violence of fevers is &s;ometimes ob&s;erved to &s;ub&s;ide.</P>
<P>I pur&s;ued the above method of procuring remi&s;&s;ion in tho&s;e fevers, where there was real inflammatory diathe&s;is prevailing in exce&s;s; but it &s;o happened, that the &s;igns of this diathe&s;is were fallacious, appear|ing in &s;ome in&s;tances to be pre&s;ent, though the real genius of the di&s;ea&s;e was actually of a different na|ture; a circum&s;tance, which occa&s;ioned a difference of management in conducting the method of cure. Exce&s;&s;ive evacuations were not only un&s;afe in &s;uch ca&s;es, but in general had not any powerful effects in di&s;po&s;ing the di&s;ea&s;e to a&s;&s;ume a remitting form. Bleeding, however, was often found to be nece&s;&s;ary, though it was &s;eldom requi&s;ite to repeat the opera|tion. The good effects which were ob&s;erved to fol|low the u&s;e of cathartics, were not in general very remarkable; yet it was proper, in mo&s;t in&s;tances, to open the body freely; for which purpo&s;e, no form of medicine, with which I am acquainted, an&s;wered better than a &s;olution of &s;alts with a &s;mall portion of emetic tartar, and &s;ometimes with the addition of lau|danum. In ca&s;es of local pain, bli&s;ters applied near the &s;eat of affection were always of eminent &s;ervice; and in ca&s;es of general irritability, they were often equally u&s;eful, when applied to the back part of the head and neck. A powder compo&s;ed of nitre, cam|phire, emetic tartar and opium, was likewi&s;e em|ployed with &s;ucce&s;s; but the liberal u&s;e of warm bath|ing, was &s;till more to be depended upon. No per|&s;on, perhaps, will refu&s;e con&s;ent to the method of pro|ceeding, which I have hitherto recommended; but when I mention a free and bold u&s;e of cold bathing, even in an early &s;tage of this fever, I do not expect the &s;ame conce&s;&s;ion. To da&s;h cold water on the head and &s;houlders of a per&s;on in a fever, has an ap|pearance of ra&s;hne&s;s and hazard. I can, however,
<PB N="148" REF="028890_0157_0FDE5E017A8429E0">
produce the te&s;timony of repeated experience for the &s;afety of the practice, no le&s;s than for its &s;ucce&s;s in procuring remi&s;&s;ion; and &s;hall therefore con&s;ider it a duty to recommend it warmly to the public. Wher|ever it was employed,&mdash;and the ca&s;es in which it was tried were numerous, a calm and equable per&s;piration, additional tone and vigour, with great abatement of irritability, were con&s;tantly ob&s;erved to en&s;ue.</P>
<P>The paroxy&s;ms and remi&s;&s;ions were generally di&s;|tinct in the beginning of fevers, where the nervous &s;y&s;tem was principally affected; but often became le&s;s &s;o, as the di&s;ea&s;e advanced in its progre&s;s; a circum|&s;tance which did not ari&s;e oftener from the nature of the complaint, than from the common method of treat|ment. Bleeding was often di&s;pen&s;ed with in the fe|vers of the We&s;t-Indies; but vomiting and purging were indulged in with freedom. The di&s;tinction of paroxy&s;m and remi&s;&s;ion was &s;ometimes evidently ren|dered ob&s;cure by this practice; while it was like|wi&s;e obviou&s;ly re&s;tored again, by the u&s;e of wine and cordials, which excited the powers of life. In this &s;pecies of di&s;ea&s;e, evacuations were &s;eldom ne|ce&s;&s;ary; &s;eldom indeed admi&s;&s;ible in a great extent. Bleeding unle&s;s under particular circum&s;tances, was totally improper. Cathartics were &s;ometimes dan|gerous, and antimonial vomits often &s;unk the patient irrecoverably. Bli&s;tering, on the contrary, even at an early period, was generally of &s;ervice; as al&s;o were opiates, and a judicious u&s;e of the warm bath; but cold bathing with &s;alt water, was, of all others, the remedy of the mo&s;t powerful effect. I do not pre|tend to &s;ay, that it ab&s;olutely &s;topped the cour&s;e of the fever; but I can &s;ay with truth, that it generally re&s;tored the di&s;tinction of paroxy&s;m and remi&s;&s;ion, dimini&s;hed irritability, and imparted a degree of tone and vigour to the &s;y&s;tem, which was ju&s;tly con&s;idered as a &s;ign of &s;afety.</P>
<P>To procure remi&s;&s;ion in fever, di&s;tingui&s;hed by a prevalence of the putre&s;cent tendency, is not in every
<PB N="149" REF="028890_0158_0FDE5E085D0D12A0">
in&s;tance an ea&s;y ta&s;k. A remitting fever, with marks of &s;pecific putrefaction, is not a di&s;ea&s;e of common occurrence in Jamaica; but a fever with &s;igns of pu|trefactive tendency, mixed with &s;ymptoms of great irritability, or a high degree of malignity, is not alto|gether rare. From the complicated nature of the di&s;|order, the indications of cure are often difficult and perplexed. Bleeding is univer&s;ally condemned; more, I believe, from theory than from actual ob&s;ervation. It was, and perhaps &s;till is, a fa&s;hionable mode of rea|&s;oning, to impute the languors and other marks of debility, which are common in the fevers of the We&s;t-Indies, to a putre&s;cent tendency in the &s;y&s;tem. Such &s;ymptoms however are in fact more generally the attendants, or di&s;tingui&s;hing &s;igns of fevers, where the nervous &s;y&s;tem is affected. In &s;uch ca&s;es, bleeding is obviou&s;ly hurtful; in the one of which we now treat, (where &s;uch a di&s;ea&s;e actually exi&s;ts,) it is not only a remedy of &s;afety, but of very eminent &s;ervice, previous to the application of cold, particularly pre|vious to cold bathing, which may be u&s;ed with free|dom and boldne&s;s. Cold bathing, indeed, is the remedy on which we mu&s;t principally depend. There are others which do good occa&s;ionally; but this is the only one I know, which has any very con|&s;iderable effect in changing the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e. There is a general rule in the practice of medicine, which requires to be particularly remembered in tho&s;e complicated &s;pecies of fever, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that as the indica|tions of cure are often embarra&s;&s;ed; &s;o the appear|ances, which principally point to danger, are fir&s;t to be attended to; while the plan of cure, which we de|termine to be the mo&s;t proper, mu&s;t be followed up with vigour and re&s;olution. We ought always to bear in mind, that in dangerous and difficult ca&s;es feeble remedies, or even powerful ones timidly u&s;ed, are of little avail. Cold bathing, employed with ti|midity, failed of doing good in &s;ome in&s;tances. I
<PB N="150" REF="028890_0159_0FDE5BEDDC87CD70">
met with no example, where the bolde&s;t u&s;e of it did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. It was &s;eldom, I mu&s;t again repeat, that it did not &s;ucceed in obviating irritability, in checking the putre&s;cent tendency, and in imparting to the &s;y&s;tem that degree of tone and vigour, in which &s;afety is ob&s;erved to con&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>The method of procuring remi&s;&s;ion, in tho&s;e fevers which were di&s;tingui&s;hed by local affections, or ir|regular determinations to particular parts, was nice, and &s;ometimes difficult. Bleeding was frequently proper, e&s;pecially, if there &s;ub&s;i&s;ted at the &s;ame time marks of a general inflammatory diathe&s;is: but it was &s;eldom &s;ufficient wholly to accompli&s;h the bu&s;ine&s;s. However, together with a judicious management of warm bathing, it greatly heightened the good effects of bli&s;ters, the remedy on which the principal de|pendence was placed. In fevers which were accom|panied with uncommon pain of the head, I have &s;ometimes found it &s;erviceable to apply cold to the part affected; the feet being at the &s;ame time immer&s;ed in warm water, and blood flowing by a large orifice from the arm. I al&s;o frequently ob&s;erved, that the general fever ran higher, though it likewi&s;e more certainly a&s;&s;umed its proper form, in con&s;equence of bleeding, bli&s;tering, and the removal of local pain. In tho&s;e fevers, where bilious appearances were the effect of accidental, irregular determination to the &s;tomach or liver, the remi&s;&s;ions were often ob&s;cure: neither did the method of treatment, which was gene|rally adopted, &s;eem to be well calculated to bring forth the natural, genuine appearance of the di&s;ea&s;e. Bilious appearances, it mu&s;t be owned, &s;ometimes vani&s;hed, while the type of the fever became more di&s;tinct after the exhibition of an emetic or bri&s;k cathartic; yet there is cau&s;e to doubt if this depended on the evacuation of bile. It might be &s;aid, with more truth, perhaps, that the action of the emetic, by exciting the powers of the &s;tomach and biliary &s;y&s;tem, effected a change in the irregular determina|tion,
<PB N="151" REF="028890_0160_0FDE5BF879EF8718">
which had formerly taken place to tho&s;e parts. It was generally ob&s;erved, where good effects did not follow the fir&s;t exhibition of remedies of this kind, that harm was u&s;ually the con&s;equence of a &s;econd. Vomiting, in &s;hort, was often rendered continual, and the di&s;tinction of paroxy&s;m and remi&s;&s;ion was ap|parently de&s;troyed, in con&s;equence of the operation of violent emetics. In&s;tructed by repeated examples of their hurtful effects, I at la&s;t &s;carcely ever em|ployed antimonial vomits; even the &s;afe&s;t kinds were u&s;ed with caution. If it appeared, at any time, that the action of vomiting would be &s;erviceable, camo|mile tea, or at farthe&s;t a few grains of ipecacuana were generally thought &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;e. When this bu&s;ine&s;s was fini&s;hed, a draught of cor|dial &s;timulating liquor, which had a tendency to pro|mote a diaphore&s;is, was next admini&s;tered. By this mode of treatment, e&s;pecially if a bli&s;ter was applied at the &s;ame time to the region of the liver, I have the &s;atisfaction to add, that the bilious appearances for the mo&s;t part vani&s;hed, and, if care was taken to &s;upport a determination to the &s;urface, &s;eldom ever returned during the continuance of the fever. Dif|ferent &s;ea&s;ons, and different &s;ituations of country were particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed by corre&s;ponding determi|nations. Thus a tendency to the bowels and biliary &s;y&s;tem was chiefly remarkable in the autumnal months, and in low and champaign countries; the head and brea&s;t were oftener affected in the winter months, and in hilly &s;ituations.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erved before, that it is the fir&s;t object in the cure of fevers, to remove tho&s;e circum&s;tances, or accidental &s;tates of the body, which hinder the di&s;|ea&s;e from a&s;&s;uming its proper form. Thus, to pro|cure remi&s;&s;ion, appeared univer&s;ally to be the fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s in the cure of the fever of Jamaica; the next, and a very important one, is to prevent the re|turn of the paroxy&s;m. If we knew a remedy, which
<PB N="152" REF="028890_0161_0FDE5C008E5F0BF0">
could be depended upon to accompli&s;h this purpo&s;e with certainty, the cure of the di&s;ea&s;e would be ea&s;y; but the Peruvian bark, which almo&s;t infallibly &s;tops the cour&s;e of intermitting fevers in all countries, does not &s;eem &s;o indi&s;putably to po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;ame power over the u&s;ual endemic of the We&s;t Indies. I am &s;orry to own, that my knowledge on this &s;ubject, is not altogether &s;atisfactory. At the time I left Jamaica I did not entertain a doubt, that the endemic of the di&s;trict, where I re&s;ided, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;omething in its own nature which decidedly determined its duration. It was u&s;ually ob&s;erved to terminate on a critical day, generally by very evident &s;igns of cri&s;is, and without &s;eeming to be materially effected in its cour&s;e, by the various and oppo&s;ite modes of treatment which were &s;ometimes pur&s;ued. But though this was true for the mo&s;t part, yet the &s;uperior efficacy of the very large do&s;es of bark, which I afterwards ventured to give in the intermitting fevers of North America, obliges me to &s;peak with he&s;itation, when I mention the powers of that remedy. It is probable that bark, with the &s;ame management, might have had the &s;ame effects, in the fever which prevailed at Savanna la Mar, as in that which is commonly epidemic in Georgia and the Carolinas; yet no doubt remains, that as commonly employed in Jamaica, it has no right to be con&s;idered as a remedy, which abruptly cuts &s;hort the cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e. In every ca&s;e where it was tried, (except one) it did not &s;eem to do more than give a degree of tone and vigour to the &s;y&s;tem, to excite a certain &s;tate of inflammatory dia|the&s;is, in con&s;equence of which, the cri&s;is was ob|&s;erved to be more perfect and complete, though it did not perhaps actually happen at an earlier period. Thus I am di&s;po&s;ed to conclude, from all the expe|rience which I have had, that bark is not generally carried farther, in the cure of the remitting fever of Jamaica, than merely to &s;upport the tone and vigour
<PB N="153" REF="028890_0162_0FDE5C0867BC2268">
of the powers of life. If we tru&s;t to it for more, in do&s;es of two &s;cruples or a drachm given every two hours, we &s;hall certainly be deceived.</P>
<P>Having mentioned the different methods of treat|ment, by which it was attempted to procure remi&s;|&s;ion in the endemic fever of Jamaica, and having likewi&s;e endeavoured to a&s;certain how far we can go in preventing the return of paroxy&s;ms, it only remains to detail &s;ome particulars in the management of the plan of cure, where the different &s;pecies of fevers were di&s;tingui&s;hed by a peculiar train of &s;ymptoms. It was ob&s;erved in general, that fevers, with a mode|rate degree of inflammatory diathe&s;is, &s;eldom re|quired our interference. The di&s;ea&s;e, after a certain duration, terminated u&s;ually of its own accord. After I had gained &s;ome experience of the general cour&s;e of fevers, I u&s;ually allowed tho&s;e, in which I did not perceive marks of danger, to go on their own way, that I might better di&s;cover tho&s;e periods, at which the di&s;ea&s;e was naturally di&s;po&s;ed to terminate. Thus where the paroxy&s;ms continued regular and di&s;tinct, the remi&s;&s;ions perfect, and the vigour unimpaired, nothing material was attempted to be done. On the con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ary, where the paroxy&s;ms were long, or le&s;s di&s;tinctly formed, with &s;igns which indicated an ap|proaching affection of the nervous &s;y&s;tem, bark, and other remedies, which excited and &s;upported the powers of life, were given with the earlie&s;t opportu|nity. Changes from inflammatory diathe&s;is to nervous affection, were ob&s;erved to happen frequently on the fifth day. Bark, and &s;uch remedies as imparted tone and vigour to the &s;y&s;tem, were given without delay; and the di&s;ea&s;e terminated for the mo&s;t part on the ninth. In tho&s;e fevers, which were of a complicated nature, in which &s;igns of inflammatory, nervous, or putrid diathe&s;is were variou&s;ly mixed, bli&s;ters applied in different manners, opiates, bathing and anti&s;pa&s;|modics were often materially u&s;eful; but it would
<PB N="154" REF="028890_0163_0FDE5BD1956372D8">
be arrogance to attempt to de&s;cribe rules for the par|ticular mode of application, which mu&s;t vary more or le&s;s in almo&s;t every ca&s;e, and which only can be learned from actual ob&s;ervation. There is one rule, however, in the treatment of fevers, of which the practitioner ought never to lo&s;e &s;ight, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that wherever it is nece&s;&s;ary to interfere, it is only the mo&s;t vigorous deci&s;ion which can do good. We cannot, as was &s;aid before, depend with certainty upon bark, as a remedy po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the power of ab&s;olutely cutting &s;hort the cau&s;e of the fever of Jamaica; yet wherever the fevers of that country di&s;covered &s;igns of nervous affection, I do not know any thing in the materia medica, from which &s;uch beneficial effects may be expected. If it did not actually &s;top the di&s;|ea&s;e, it was eminently &s;erviceable in conducting it to a favourable i&s;&s;ue. Opium, wine, &s;nake-root, &amp;c. were often ob&s;erved to heighten its good qualities: but the particular u&s;e of &s;uch additions can only be regulated by circum&s;tances. Wine has been freely recommended in fevers with &s;ymptoms of nervous affection; and it mu&s;t be owned, that its good effects were con&s;iderable, not only in real debility, but wherever the cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e acted by weakening or depre&s;&s;ing the powers of life. Wine was likewi&s;e ob&s;erved to be more u&s;eful in ca&s;es of mobility and weakne&s;s, than in ca&s;es of &s;tupor and &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the nervous influence. But though it is actually a remedy of great value, its virtues appear to have been greatly enhanced. In many in&s;tances it was not proper in any quantity; in &s;ome, it was only proper in a &s;mall quantity, and in very few, perhaps, could we allow of the quantities which are given in common practice. At one time I carried the u&s;e of wine in the nervous fever of Jamaica, to a very great length; but I afterwards learnt, that a third part of the quan|tity would have probably an&s;wered the purpo&s;e better. Though it undoubtedly is an u&s;eful cordial and tonic,
<PB N="155" REF="028890_0164_0FDE5BDB78B9F518">
it is &s;till inferior to cool air, and particularly to cold bathing.</P>
<P>In tho&s;e treacherous and malignant fevers, which I have de&s;cribed in the third &s;ection of the &s;ixth chap|ter, the ordinary medical aids were often feeble and in&s;ufficient. The cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e was generally rapid. There was little time left for deliberation; and where the fir&s;t, at lea&s;t where the &s;econd remi&s;|&s;ion pa&s;&s;ed over, without &s;ome bold and decided &s;teps to prevent the return of the paroxy&s;m, or change the na|ture of the &s;ymptoms, the opportunity was probably never again in our power. The type of this malig|nant fever was u&s;ually of the &s;ingle tertian kind; yet it was often found to anticipate, by &s;uch long antici|pations, that the &s;econd paroxy&s;m &s;ometimes made its appearance, before any decided &s;teps were taken by the practitioner to &s;top its progre&s;s, or often, indeed, before there were any &s;urmi&s;es of danger. As this di&s;ea&s;e &s;eemed to have a nearer re&s;emblance to the in|termittent, than &s;ome other &s;pecies of the endemic of Jamaica; &s;o bark appeared to be capable of produc|ing more effect, in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, than in tho&s;e ca&s;es where the remi&s;&s;ions were more ob&s;cure. It &s;till, however, de&s;erves to be remarked, that &s;uch &s;canty do&s;es, as were u&s;ually given in Jamaica, could not be effectual; indeed, we could &s;carcely hope, that any powerful alteration could ari&s;e from le&s;s than half an ounce given at the &s;hort interval of every other hour. I confe&s;s candidly, that I never ventured &s;o far; yet I al&s;o confe&s;s, that I am by no means &s;atisfied with the &s;ucce&s;s of the method of cure, which I adopted at fir&s;t, in this di&s;ea&s;e. I lo&s;t &s;ome patients before I was aware of danger, and perhaps &s;uffered others to die, from a dread of &s;tepping over the bounds of common practice. At la&s;t, I acted with more de|ci&s;ion; and have cau&s;e to be &s;atisfied with the &s;ucce&s;s of the attempt. As &s;oon as I di&s;covered the malig|nity of the di&s;ea&s;e, the marks of which, for the mo&s;t
<PB N="156" REF="028890_0165_0FDE5BE719617F60">
part, were plain in the cour&s;e of the fir&s;t paroxy&s;m, the head was immediately &s;haved, and covered with a bli&s;ter, which reached half way down the neck; the feet were likewi&s;e put into warm water, previous to the expected return of the paroxy&s;m; the body was rubbed with brandy or rum; wine, and &s;ome|times opium were given in quantity &s;ufficient to ex|hilirate the &s;pirits, or to produce a low degree of in|toxication; bark was al&s;o pre&s;cribed in larger do&s;es than u&s;ual, during the remi&s;&s;ions; and cold bathing was occa&s;ionally employed with freedom. I do not &s;ay, that the return of the paroxy&s;m was ab&s;olutely prevented by this method of treatment, but I have the &s;atisfaction to add, that the fatal tendency of the di&s;ea&s;e was evidently obviated by it.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t farther ob&s;erve, that bark has been con&s;i|dered as the principal remedy in tho&s;e fevers, the na|ture of which has been believed to be putrid; but the great fame of this remedy has proceeded from theo|ry, rather than from actual ob&s;ervation. A real pu|trid di&s;ea&s;e, (as I have &s;aid before), if we except the yellow fever, occurs very &s;eldom in Jamaica. Symp|toms of languor and debility, however, are frequent in the fevers of that country; appearances which, though in fact, only &s;igns of nervous affection, have often been imputed to a putrid tendency in the habit. Bark has been found to be efficacious in tho&s;e ca&s;es of languor and debility, which have been fal&s;ely thought to ari&s;e from a putrefactive tendency in the &s;y&s;tem. Hence this remedy has gained credit, on a foundation which does not exi&s;t. I may add with truth, that the power of the bark was very equivo|cal, in tho&s;e ca&s;es where the marks of putrid tenden|cy were obvious. The principal dependence was then con&s;tantly placed in the cold &s;alt-water bath; which, if well managed, produced mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing effects. An additional quantity of &s;alt was often added to the water of the &s;ea; and care was taken
<PB N="157" REF="028890_0166_0FDE5B573621BA20">
that the coldne&s;s &s;hould be as great as the circum|&s;tances of the climate would permit. The chief depen|dence I have &s;aid, was con&s;tantly placed in this re|medy, where the putrid tendency prevailed in the general &s;y&s;tem; but where it was more particularly confined to the bounds of the alimentary canal, &s;aline draughts, in the &s;tate of efferve&s;cence, were u&s;eful, as were likewi&s;e gly&s;ters of cold water impregnated with fixed air. It is &s;uperfluous to mention cool air, clean linen, cold drink and the liberal u&s;e of wine.</P>
<P>The remedies, which I have hitherto mentioned, are &s;uch, as &s;eem chiefly intended to &s;upport and in|vigorate the general powers of life; but which are le&s;s immediately directed to obviate the fatal tendency of particular &s;ymptoms; which I propo&s;ed to con&s;i|der, as the &s;econd indication of cure. I &s;hall pro|bably depart material<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> from the u&s;ual ideas of prac|titioners in the pro&s;ecution of this &s;ubject. I do not deny, that bark may be given with &s;afety in fevers, which are accompanied with local affections, or ir|regular determinations to particular parts; yet I mu&s;t likewi&s;e ob&s;erve, that bark is not the remedy on which the weight of the cure depends. Local affec|tions, or irregular determinations are often di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by the name of the efforts of nature. I do not indeed di&s;pute, where the part of the body, to which the determination takes place, is of little importance to life, or more certainly, where it is an organ of excretion, that &s;uch parts as are of greater con&s;equence, are, in &s;ome degree relieved in con&s;e|quence of this effect; and though there is &s;till an im|propriety, there is le&s;s danger in con&s;idering this ir|regular action of the morbid cau&s;e, as an effort of na|ture, or a quality of the vis naturae medicatrix, by means of which, the health of the &s;y&s;tem is eventu|ally rendered more &s;ecure. This, however, is only a circum&s;tance of accident. It does not appear to depend upon a regular de&s;ign of nature, and cannot
<PB N="158" REF="028890_0167_0FDE5B5E1AFB4D88">
be admitted with &s;afety as the ba&s;is of a plan of cure. We find, in &s;hort, that though the life of the whole is &s;ometimes pre&s;erved by it, the de&s;truction or de|rangement of the part is generally the con&s;equence. But that the fallacious tendency of tho&s;e tumultuary efforts of nature may be more clearly illu&s;trated, I &s;hall adduce the example of fevers, di&s;tingui&s;hed by an increa&s;ed &s;ecretion of bile. It is an opinion, which &s;eems to date its origin from Hippocrates, that bile vitiated in quality, or redundant in quantity, de&s;erves to be con&s;idered as the cau&s;e of the &s;pecies of di&s;ea&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of ardent fever: and it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that the frequent appearance of bilious di&s;charges, in the fevers of hot climates, gives countenance to the &s;uppo&s;ition. From the fre|quency of this &s;ymptom, perhaps, the practitioners of the We&s;t-Indies adopted the idea, that bile is the cau&s;e of the fever of that country; while the method of cure, which they u&s;ually pur&s;ue, has &s;erved to con|firm them in their error. Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with an opinion of the prevalence of bile, they admini&s;ter cathartics and emetics with a liberal hand. If bile appears in the fir&s;t evacuations, they con&s;ider it &s;ufficient authority to proceed; if it does not appear, they conclude that the remedy has not been of &s;ufficient force to reach the &s;eat of the di&s;ea&s;e; and therefore per&s;i&s;t in their in|tentions, till the effect is at la&s;t produced. It is well known, that a repetition of cathartics and emetics &s;eldom fails to produce the appearances of a bilious di&s;ea&s;e. Hence this &s;ymptom of fever, and all the dangers which follow it, are frequently the work of our own hands. That this is the ca&s;e, appears from a relation of the method of cure, which I u&s;ually adopted in &s;uch fevers as were di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;ymp|toms of this nature at an early period. In&s;tead of encouraging the vomiting, or promoting the evacua|tion of bile downwards, I generally did every thing in my power to moderate, or even to check it.&mdash;
<PB N="159" REF="028890_0168_0FDE5B6C661348B0">
Sometimes I pre&s;cribed an emetic; but it was more with a view to excite the action of the &s;tomach and biliary &s;y&s;tem, than to promote an evacuation of re|dundant or vitiated humours. After the operation of vomiting was fini&s;hed, a bli&s;ter was u&s;ually applied to the region of the liver, and &s;uch a plan of cure was pur&s;ued, as &s;upported a determination to the &s;ur|face of the body, and gave tone and vigour to the &s;to|mach and general powers of life. By this mode of treat|ment, bilious appearances vani&s;hed &s;peedily, or cea&s;|ed to be trouble&s;ome; while by the repeated u&s;e of emetics and cathartics, they generally continued long, and often prevailed throughout the cour&s;e of the di&s;|ea&s;e. We may thus, I hope, conclude, without any unnatural inference, that there appears to be danger in encouraging tho&s;e tumults, which have been u&s;ual|ly con&s;idered as the efforts of nature. If they are in fact efforts, no per&s;on can pretend to deny, that they are generally precarious; nay, that they are often the immediate cau&s;es of death.</P>
<P>I have now detailed the particular &s;teps of the me|thod of cure, which I adopted in the remitting fever of Jamaica; a di&s;ea&s;e which I treated, in &s;ome re&s;|pects, on a different plan, and if &s;elf-love hath not blinded me with more &s;ucce&s;s than the generality of tho&s;e practitioners whom I had the opportunity of knowing, I treated the di&s;ea&s;e with &s;ucce&s;s; but I dare not affirm, as &s;ome have done, that under this method of treatment, I never lo&s;t a patient. I proceeded, indeed, with diffidence and di&s;tru&s;t of the powers of the medical art; venturing no farther than to &s;up|port the general powers of life, and to obviate &s;ymp|toms of a fatal tendency. Many pretend to cut &s;hort the cour&s;e of fevers, by the force of a &s;ingle remedy; but the means do not appear very obvious, and the effect was often precarious. I grant, that it is &s;ometimes in the power of the practitioner to ex|terminate the cau&s;e of di&s;ea&s;e by forcible means, or
<PB N="160" REF="028890_0169_0FDE5B76A5ABAD40">
to de&s;troy a certain aptitude of con&s;titution, in which this di&s;ea&s;e may be &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t; but I mu&s;t at the &s;ame time ob&s;erve, that there is danger likewi&s;e, lea&s;t he extingui&s;h life. The bark, which has been &s;o much celebrated for checking the cour&s;e of fevers, though generally &s;afe, is &s;eldom effectual: others are frequently dangerous. During the time that I re|mained in the We&s;t Indies, I ob&s;erved attentively the &s;tate of body, which u&s;ually attended recovery; as likewi&s;e tho&s;e appearances which preceded, and apparently were the cau&s;es of death. Tone and vi|gour, or a moderate degree of the &s;tate of body di&s;|tingui&s;hed by the name of inflammatory diathe&s;is, without local affection, afforded the &s;ure&s;t &s;igns of &s;afety; general failure of the powers of life, or ir|regular determinations to organs of importance, were the mo&s;t certain appearances of danger. Thus, af|ter obviating particular &s;ymptoms of a fatal tendency, it was the principal indication to &s;upport the general powers of life, or to excite the tone and vigour of the &s;y&s;tem. This was be&s;t accompli&s;hed by bark, wine, cool air, and above all, by cold bathing, which I am induced to con&s;ider as the mo&s;t important remedy in the cure of the fevers of the We&s;t-Indies; and, perhaps, in the cure of the fevers of all hot climates. Though it might not ab&s;olutely cut &s;hort the cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e; yet it &s;eldom failed to change the fatal ten|dency of its nature.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. YELLOW FEVER. (a)</HEAD>
<P>THE di&s;ea&s;e, known in the We&s;t Indies by the name of yellow fever, particularly that &s;pecies of the di&s;ea&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hed by black vomiting, has not, &s;o far as I know, been de&s;cribed by the practi|tioners of any other country. In the autumnal fevers of mo&s;t climates, indeed, as well as in the remitting fever of Jamaica, yellowne&s;s is not by any means un|common: neither is vomiting of matter of a dark colour altogether rare, in the moments preceding death: yet in as much as I can judge, from what I have &s;een my&s;elf, or heard from others, the complaint which is the &s;ubject of the pre&s;ent treati&s;e, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;ome characteri&s;tics of its own, different from tho&s;e of every other di&s;ea&s;e. I do not pretend to deter|mine, in what this characteri&s;tic difference preci&s;ely con&s;i&s;ts: yet I may &s;ay with confidence, that the &s;pecies of this di&s;ea&s;e, which terminates in black vo|miting, may be di&s;tingui&s;hed with certainty from the autumnal fever of agui&s;h countries, or from the en|demic remitting fever of Jamaica, even in the fir&s;t hours of its attack. I mu&s;t, however, at the &s;ame time own, that there is a &s;pecies of di&s;ea&s;e, where the remi&s;&s;ions are ob&s;cure, and where &s;igns of nervous affection, or even &s;ometimes of apparent inflamma|tion, are more con&s;picuous than &s;ymptoms of putre&s;|cency, that I have &s;ome difficulty in cla&s;&s;ing properly. There is not any thing more foreign to my intention than multiplying names, or e&s;tabli&s;hing di&s;tinctions which do not exi&s;t in reality; yet, as I have often &s;een in&s;tances of fever, to which yellowne&s;s and black vomiting did not &s;eem to be e&s;&s;ential; but in which paroxy&s;ms and remi&s;&s;ions were extremely ob&s;cure,
<PB N="162" REF="028890_0171_0FDE5B86151CB578">
or perhaps did not exi&s;t, I at la&s;t ventured to con|clude, that this &s;pecies of illne&s;s had more affinity with the di&s;order u&s;ually known by the name of yellow fever, than with the common remitting endemic of the country. I &s;hall therefore de&s;cribe it as a &s;pecies of that di&s;ea&s;e; though I am le&s;s &s;olicitous about fixing its place in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;ological arrangement, than of giving a hi&s;tory of it, by which it may be ea&s;ily recognized.</P>
<P>I am not ignorant that there are &s;everal authors, who have written on the &s;ubject of the yellow fever; yet I had not the opportunity of con&s;ulting any of them, except Dr. Hillary, during the time that I lived in Jamaica. This writer's method of cure was adopted very generally by the medical people of the i&s;land, and many of them were di&s;po&s;ed to think fa|vourably of its &s;ucce&s;s. I cannot however conceal, that I was di&s;appointed in every in&s;tance where I &s;aw it employed. If, in any ca&s;e, the patient recovered, this fortunate event appeared to be more owing to great natural &s;trength of con&s;titution, or to a lower degree of di&s;ea&s;e, than to the efficacy of the method of treatment. But be&s;ides, that this author's method of cure is feeble and ineffectual, the hi&s;torical part is particularly defective; the di&s;ea&s;e, in &s;hort, being only very imperfectly di&s;criminated from the common endemic of that country. The con&s;ideration of the&s;e circum&s;tances, induced me to throw together the ob|&s;ervations which I had made on this &s;ubject, during the time that I re&s;ided in the We&s;t Indies; and though I am con&s;cious that they are imperfect, I &s;till hope that they contain &s;ome hints which may be u&s;eful to tho&s;e, who have had little experience of the fevers of hot climates.</P>
<P>In our enquiries into the hi&s;tory of the yellow fever, &s;ome circum&s;tances pre&s;ent them&s;elves to our ob&s;ervation which are not a little curious. It has never been ob&s;erved that a negro, immediately from
<PB N="163" REF="028890_0172_0FDE5B8C1FA40190">
the coa&s;t of Africa, has been attacked with this di&s;|ea&s;e; neither have Creoles, who have lived con&s;tantly in their native country, ever been known to &s;uffer from it: yet Creoles or Africans, who have travelled to Europe, or the higher latitudes of America, are not by any means exempted from it, when they return to the i&s;lands of the We&s;t Indies. Europeans, males particularly, &s;uffer from it &s;oon after their arrival in the tropical countries; yet, after the natives of Europe have remained for a year or two in tho&s;e hot climates, e&s;pecially after they have experienced the ordinary endemic of the country, the appearance of the yellow fever is ob&s;erved to be only a rare occurrence. But be&s;ides, that this di&s;ea&s;e &s;eldom di&s;covers it&s;elf among tho&s;e people, who have lived any length of time in a tropical country, it has likewi&s;e &s;carcely ever been known to attack the &s;ame per&s;on twice, unle&s;s acci|dentally after his return from a colder region. The remitting fever, on the contrary, does not cea&s;e to attack &s;uch as have re&s;ided the greate&s;t part of their life in tho&s;e climates; or who have lived after the mo&s;t regular and ab&s;temious manner; a fact which &s;eems to prove, that there actually exi&s;ts &s;ome e&s;&s;en|tial difference between the two di&s;ea&s;es; or which &s;hews, at lea&s;t, that the revolution of a &s;ea&s;on or two de&s;troys in the European con&s;titution, a certain apti|tude or di&s;po&s;ition for the one di&s;ea&s;e, which it &s;till retains for the other.</P>
<P>Having thus premi&s;ed &s;ome circum&s;tances, which regard the general nature of the yellow fever, I &s;hall proceed to give a more particular de&s;cription of the di&s;ea&s;e, previou&s;ly dividing it into three forms, in each of which, I believe, I have frequently &s;een it appear. 1. Into a &s;pecies of di&s;ea&s;e, in which &s;igns of putre|faction are evident at a very early &s;tage, which is generally rapid in its cour&s;e, and which u&s;ually ter|minates in black vomiting. Yellowne&s;s &s;eldom or never fails to make its appearance in the pre&s;ent in|&s;tance;
<PB N="164" REF="028890_0173_0FDE5B93AAB4C510">
and perhaps it is only this form, which, &s;trictly &s;peaking, can be called the yellow fever. 2. Into a form of fever, which either has no remi&s;&s;ions, or re|mi&s;&s;ions which are &s;carcely perceptible; in which &s;igns of nervous affection are more obvious than &s;ymptoms of putre&s;cency; and in which yellowne&s;s and black vomiting are rare occurrences. 3. Into another form, in which regular paroxy&s;ms and re|mi&s;&s;ions cannot be traced; but in which there are marks of violent irritation, and appearances of in|flammatory diathe&s;is in the earlier &s;tage, which give way after a &s;hort continuance to &s;igns of debility and putre&s;cency, to which yellowne&s;s frequently &s;ucceeds, or even &s;ometimes the &s;o much dreaded vomiting of matter of a dark colour. The di&s;ea&s;e, which I have divided in the above manner into three di&s;tinct forms, appears to be in reality only one and the &s;ame. The difference of the &s;ymptoms probably ari&s;es from very trivial or very accidental cau&s;es; and it is a matter of great difficulty to di&s;criminate tho&s;e &s;igns, which are e&s;&s;ential and nece&s;&s;ary to its exi&s;tence. It is in &s;ome degree peculiar to &s;trangers from colder regions &s;oon ofter their arrival in the We&s;t Indies, and may generally be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the remitting endemic of the country, not only by the ob&s;curene&s;s, or total want of paroxyms and remi&s;&s;ions, but likewi&s;e by a certain expre&s;&s;ion of the eye and countenance, with &s;omething unu&s;ually di&s;agreeable in the feelings, of which words convey only an imperfect idea.</P>

<P>I SHALL de&s;cribe, in the fir&s;t place, the mo&s;t common and mo&s;t formidable &s;pecies of this di&s;|ea&s;e, which, as I ob&s;erved before, is di&s;tingui&s;hed by early &s;igns of putre&s;cency, by an inten&s;e degree
<PB N="165" REF="028890_0174_0FDE5B99548CB630">
of yellowne&s;s; and, towards its termination, u&s;ually by vomiting of matter of a dark colour. It was mentioned in the preceding treati&s;e, concerning the remitting fever of Jamaica, that fever of different types had their different hours of inva&s;ion; but no &s;uch property was ob&s;erved in the pre&s;ent di&s;ea&s;e. In &s;ome in&s;tances the yellow fever began in the morn|ing, though the evening, upon the whole, was the more u&s;ual time of its attack. The fir&s;t &s;ymptoms were languor, debility and head-ach, together with an affection of the &s;tomach peculiarly di&s;agreeable. This la&s;t often preceded the others, and was in &s;ome mea&s;ure characteri&s;tic; but it is impo&s;&s;ible to give a clear idea of it in words:&mdash;anxiety, nau&s;ea, and certain unu&s;ual feelings were &s;o &s;trangely combined, that any de&s;cription, which I might attempt to give of this complicated &s;en&s;ation, would hardly be intel|ligible. The horror and &s;hivering, which &s;o u&s;ually precede fevers, was &s;eldom great in degree in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance; but it &s;ometime continued long, and was often accompanied with &s;en&s;ations of a very unplea&s;ant kind. The heat of the body, though rarely inten&s;e, was frequently of an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and pun|gent nature. The pul&s;e was weak and confined in its &s;troke. It was likewi&s;e frequent, and the nature of the arterial pul&s;ations were creeping or vermicu|lar; in &s;hort there was a perpetual motion under the finger, combined with &s;omething, which gave the idea, that the di&s;ea&s;e was not of the kind which has paroxy&s;ms and remi&s;&s;ions. Together with this, the eye was &s;ad and watery; or in &s;ome degree inflamed, having much that appearance, which is the con&s;equence of expo&s;ure to the &s;moke of green wood. The face was often flu&s;hed; yet the flu&s;hing, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, was different from that which ari&s;es from ordi|nary cau&s;es. There was a degree of confu&s;ion, and often a degree of grimne&s;s joined with it, difficult to be de&s;cribed in words; but which a per&s;on, ac|quainted
<PB N="166" REF="028890_0175_0FDE5B9F80C3C918">
with the appearances of the di&s;ea&s;e, imme|diately recognizes as a di&s;tingui&s;hing mark of its character. The tongue was often moi&s;t, and gene|rally &s;oul; the thir&s;t was &s;eldom great, and though there was u&s;ually a peculiar nau&s;ea, there was rarely any &s;evere vomiting or retching. The breathing was hurried, for the mo&s;t part, with much anxiety and di&s;tre&s;s; while the patient frequently expre&s;&s;ed &s;ufferings, which a per&s;on, unacquainted with the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e, would be di&s;po&s;ed to believe were not real.</P>
<P>The &s;ymptoms, which I have enumerated above, are tho&s;e which u&s;ually &s;hew them&s;elves in the fir&s;t twelve hours of the di&s;ea&s;e. I marked them with all the attention of which I was capable; yet &s;till I am fearful, that the hi&s;tory may not be &s;o explicit as to be totally free from ambiguity. The characteri&s;tic marks of the yellow fever, are not by any means doubtful to a per&s;on well acquainted with the di&s;ea&s;es of hot climates; but they are not ea&s;ily conveyed in words, and may often be overlooked by tho&s;e, who have drawn their information from books alone. I am induced to think &s;o, from an in&s;tance which happened to my&s;elf. I had read Hillary's account of the yel|low fever, both before and &s;oon after my arrival in Jamaica; I had likewi&s;e heard &s;ome conver&s;ation on the &s;ubject, &s;o that I might be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been tolerably well informed of the general character of the di&s;ea&s;e; yet the fir&s;t per&s;on, who came under my care in this illne&s;s, was within a few hours of death before I knew the di&s;order, or even &s;u&s;pected it to be of a dangerous nature. Fortunately for the peace of my con&s;cience, the patient had been vi&s;ited, on both the fir&s;t and &s;econd day after the attack, by a practitioner who had lived many years in the i&s;land; but, between carele&s;&s;ne&s;s and inexperience, the poor man's &s;ituation was either not known, or not attended to, till approaches of death were vi&s;ible. The body
<PB N="167" REF="028890_0176_0FDE5BA83B22B3D0">
had been evacuated very plentifully by a &s;olution of &s;alts, during the two fir&s;t days of the illne&s;s; but no material good &s;eemed to en&s;ue from it. The patient complained &s;till more on the &s;econd day, than he had done on the fir&s;t; but as the external &s;igns of fever were moderate, I really &s;u&s;pected that he complained without much cau&s;e. It &s;o happened, that I could not vi&s;it him on the third; and on the morning of the fourth, he became of a deep orange colour, and vo|mited black matter in great quantity. I then &s;u&s;|pected, that this complaint, to which I had not paid particular attention, was actually the di&s;ea&s;e known by the name of yellow fever; but it appeared like|wi&s;e, to be &s;o far advanced in its progre&s;s, that I could do nothing more than witne&s;s the approach of death. My want of di&s;cernment, and in &s;ome degree my carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, a charge from which I cannot alto|gether acquit my&s;elf, made &s;o deep an impre&s;&s;ion on my mind, that I turned over every circum&s;tance of the di&s;ea&s;e with which my memory &s;upplied me; and I &s;oon had that &s;atisfaction to find, that the mi&s;take which I had committed, had not happened to me without leaving an u&s;eful le&s;&s;on. In ten or twelve days another per&s;on was affected in a manner &s;o &s;i|milar to the former, that I &s;u&s;pected the di&s;ea&s;e to be the &s;ame, and the event proved my &s;u&s;picions to have been well founded. From that time forward, I never found difficulty in di&s;tingui&s;hing this parti|cular form of fever, in the fir&s;t hours of its attack, not only from the remitting endemic of the country, but even from the other two &s;pecies of this di&s;ea&s;e, which I &s;hall afterwards de&s;cribe.</P>
<P>A trifling abatement of the &s;ymptoms, was &s;ome|times taken notice of, in ten or twelve hours after the commencement of this di&s;ea&s;e; but in no in&s;tance &s;o far as I have ob&s;erved, was there ever &s;o much al|leviation, as with any ju&s;tice could be called a re|mi&s;&s;ion. The &s;ymptoms of di&s;tre&s;s, where any abate|ment
<PB N="168" REF="028890_0177_0FDE5BAD91B31CD8">
had been perceptible, recurred in a &s;hort time with aggravation; and if there actually ever was any relief afterwards, it was only momentary and uncer|tain. The appearance of the eye became &s;till more de&s;ponding, with a &s;en&s;ation of burning heat, and greater marks of inflammation, affording inconte&s;ti|ble &s;igns of the real genius and nature of the fever. The pain of the head was now violent; the counte|nance was confu&s;ed and grim: the gums were fre|quently &s;pongy, and di&s;po&s;ed to bleed; the tongue, which was &s;ometimes moi&s;t, &s;ometimes dry, was al|mo&s;t always foul; the thir&s;t was irregular; at one time inten&s;e, at another very little increa&s;ed beyond what it naturally is. Nau&s;ea, I ob&s;erved above, was a common &s;ign, from the fir&s;t hours of the illne&s;s; yet vomiting, during the fir&s;t day or two, was not by any means a con&s;tant, perhaps &s;carcely a frequent &s;ymptom: neither, if it did take place, was it often found to be bilious. The liquor thrown up, for the mo&s;t part, was clear; in &s;hort, &s;eldom altered from the &s;tate in which it had been drank, unle&s;s by hav|ing acquired an unu&s;ual degree of ropine&s;s, or by pre&s;enting &s;ome flakes of a darker coloured mucus. To the above &s;ymptoms we might add, uncommon re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s and anxiety; a torment &s;carcely to be ex|pre&s;&s;ed in words; watchfulne&s;s; a hurried and diffi|cult re&s;piration; frequent deep and heavy &s;ighing, with more or le&s;s di&s;po&s;ition to faint, where any exer|tion was attempted. It de&s;erves to be remarked, however, with regard to the di&s;po&s;ition to faint in the yellow fever, that it did not depend upon the &s;ame cau&s;e, as in &s;ome other di&s;ea&s;es. It &s;eemed, in fact, to be owing to torpor of the nervous power, rather than to exce&s;s of mobility. The patient was often able to &s;tand upright, for &s;ome time, even to walk to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance; and when at la&s;t overcome, was ob&s;erved to fall down in a torpid, rather than in a fainting &s;tate. Sweating was a rare occurrence in
<PB N="169" REF="028890_0178_0FDE5BB3B2A54D30">
this &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e; at lea&s;t I do not find, that I ever had remarked any greater degree of it, than a clammy moi&s;ture on the head and neck. It was al&s;o rarely ob&s;erved, that the external heat was much increa&s;ed beyond its natural &s;tate; while the pul&s;e now began gradually to abate in point of frequency. The yellowne&s;s, which is inten&s;e in the la&s;t &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e, was &s;eldom &s;een in the period which I now de&s;cribe; yet, together with a general obfu&s;ca|tion of countenance, a tawney hue rather than a pale|ne&s;s, was ob&s;erved about the eyes and corners of the mouth, when the patient turned accidentally languid and faint. The body was frequently co&s;tive in the fir&s;t days of the illne&s;s; and I have even &s;een &s;ome in&s;tances where &s;trong cathartics did not occa&s;ion the u&s;ual evacuations. The urine was generally high coloured, and turbid. In &s;ome ca&s;es there was active hoemorrhage from the no&s;e; which was gene|rally followed with &s;ome relief from the violent pain of the head. I have al&s;o ob&s;erved a high degree of delirium, though I never &s;aw any in&s;tances, where this &s;ymptom was of long continuance.</P>
<P>The duration of the tumultuary &s;tate, which I have de&s;cribed is uncertain. Sometimes it did not exceed twenty-four hours, though it more generally con|tinued till the third day; &s;ometimes even longer. The &s;ymptoms, which now made their appearance, were many of them different in their nature from the former. The agony of di&s;tre&s;s, which was &s;o &s;trongly depicted in the countenance of the patient, during the fir&s;t days of the di&s;ea&s;e, was ob&s;erved about this time to be &s;en&s;ibly dimini&s;hed; the eye became more cheerful, the countenance more &s;erene and compo&s;ed; yet yellowne&s;s of the &s;kin became &s;peedily evident: the external heat and fever &s;ub&s;ided; the pul&s;e became gradually fuller and &s;lower, and approached by de|grees to its natural &s;tate: no &s;weat or moi&s;ture was now ob&s;ervable on any part of the body; the &s;tate of
<PB N="170" REF="028890_0179_0FDE5BBC447455C8">
the &s;kin impre&s;&s;ed the idea, as if it were not pervious to any degree of per&s;piration, and heat gradually for|&s;ook the &s;urface and extremities; the tongue turned moi&s;t, and at the &s;ame time frequently clean about the edges: the gums turned redder, more &s;pongy, and &s;hewed a greater di&s;po&s;ition to bleed: vomiting was now trouble&s;ome&mdash;the liquor thrown up was ropy, much in quantity, and abounding with villous or mucus flakes of a darker colour: thir&s;t in a great mea&s;ure vani&s;hed; but &s;en&s;ations of anxiety, di&s;tre&s;s and unea&s;ine&s;s in the region of the &s;tomach &s;uffered no material abatement.</P>
<P>Things went on in this manner, &s;ometimes for one day only, &s;ometimes for two, three or more. The circulation in the extreme ve&s;&s;els became gradually more languid; the natural heat retired from the &s;ur|face of the body, which was now dry and impervious; the pul&s;e returned nearly to its ordinary &s;tate, or became &s;low, full, and regular; the yellowne&s;s in|crea&s;ed fa&s;t; &s;o that the whole of the body was fre|quently yellow as an orange, or of as deep a colour as the &s;kin of an American &s;avage; anxiety was in|expre&s;&s;ible; vomiting was irre&s;trainable, and the &s;o much dreaded &s;ymptom of vomiting of a matter re|&s;embling the grounds of coffee, at la&s;t made its appearance. It de&s;erves, however, to be remarked, with regard to this formidable &s;ymptom, that the colour of what was thrown up, was often black as foot, where the di&s;ea&s;e had hurried on rapidly to the la&s;t &s;tage: while it was not only le&s;s inten&s;ely black, but was often tinged with green, where the progre&s;s had been &s;low and gradual. I ob&s;erved before, that villous or mucus flakes were di&s;covered early in the vomit|ings of the patient, and that the&s;e appearances increa&s;ed as the di&s;ea&s;e advanced in its progre&s;s. I may now add, that &s;treaks of blood were &s;ometimes found to be joined with them; the greate&s;t part of which &s;eemed to come from the throat and gums. The
<PB N="171" REF="028890_0180_0FDE5BC26739CB38">
vomiting, which now returned at &s;horter intervals as the di&s;ea&s;e approached this fatal period, was &s;eldom accompanied with violent retching. A quantity of liquor, &s;ometimes a quantity &s;o enormous, that we could not help wondering whence it had been &s;upplied, having been collected in the &s;tomach, was di&s;charged without much difficulty, and the patient enjoyed &s;ome re&s;pite till a like accumulation had again taken place. It may further be remarked, that as &s;oon as the vo|mited liquor acquired this dark and &s;ooty colour, the belly generally turned loo&s;e, the &s;tools being black and &s;mooth, not unlike tar or mola&s;&s;es. The tongue likewi&s;e became clean, the gums became putrid; hoemorrhage, or rather oozings of blood were &s;ometimes ob&s;erved at different parts of the body; while livid blotches frequently made their ap|pearance on the belly and in&s;ides of the thighs. The pul&s;e, which during the latter &s;tages of the di&s;|ea&s;e, could &s;carcely be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the pul&s;e of a per&s;on in health, became at la&s;t quick, irregular, or intermitting; &s;oon after which, coma or convul&s;ions clo&s;ed the &s;cene. It may not be improper to remark, before leaving the &s;ubject, that the yellowne&s;s of the &s;kin, which was &s;aid to precede the black vomiting in mo&s;t in&s;tances, in &s;ome ca&s;es was found to &s;ucceed to it. In &s;uch, the vomiting began unexpectedly, or without much previous affection of the &s;tomach; the colour of it was u&s;ually inten&s;ely black, the patient turned yellow almo&s;t in an in&s;tant, and died in a very &s;hort &s;pace of time:&mdash;the di&s;ea&s;e, in &s;hort, pa&s;&s;ed &s;ud|denly from the fir&s;t &s;tage to the la&s;t.</P>
<P>I may ob&s;erve in this place, that the number of tho&s;e who recovered from the la&s;t &s;tage of this &s;pecies of the yellow fever, was extremely &s;mall: yet, though &s;uch fortunate in&s;tances were rare, they were not al|together wanting. The termination, however, did not appear to be by regular cri&s;is. The black vo|miting cea&s;ed, &s;ometimes apparently in con&s;equence
<PB N="172" REF="028890_0181_0FDE5BC910003100">
of treatment, &s;ometimes evidently of its own accord; but a vomiting of a ropy, glutinous matter continued for a great length of time, together with an extreme irritability of &s;tomach, and a very peculiar &s;tate of the &s;kin; which &s;ometimes did not recover its natu|ral &s;moothne&s;s and unctuo&s;ity, till after &s;everal weeks had elap&s;ed.</P>
<P>During the time that I lived in Jamaica, I opened &s;everal per&s;ons who died of this di&s;ea&s;e; but it was &s;eldom that I found any material variation in the ap|pearances. Soon after death, and even &s;ometimes before death had actually taken place, the body be|came covered with large livid blotches; and, it is almo&s;t unnece&s;&s;ary to mention, was extremely offen|&s;ive. In opening the abdomen, the omentum and all its appendages were di&s;covered to be in a dry and parched &s;tate, and of an uncommon dark grey colour. But together with this dark grey colour of the omen|tum, and a want of the unctuo&s;ity or moi&s;ture, which is u&s;ually found in the cavity of the abdomen, the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines had a dirty yellow appearance, were highly putrified, and much di&s;tended with wind. The liver and &s;pleen were generally enlarged in &s;ize; the colour of the liver was often of a deeper yellow, than that of any other of the abdominal vi&s;cera; while the texture of the &s;pleen was frequently le&s;s firm, than it is found to be in its natural &s;tate. The gall|bladder, for the mo&s;t part, was moderately full; but the bile it contained, was black and thick, not un|like tar or mola&s;&s;es. The biliary ducts were like|wi&s;e enlarged, and moderately filled with the &s;ame &s;ort of bile, which was found in the gall-bladder: while the very blood ve&s;&s;els of the liver bore the marks of uncommon di&s;ten&s;ion. In the cavity of the &s;to|mach likewi&s;e, there was u&s;ually more or le&s;s of a dark coloured liquor, &s;imilar to what had been thrown up in the la&s;t &s;tage of the illne&s;s. But be&s;ides, that this dirty fluid was generally pre&s;ent in the &s;tomach
<PB N="173" REF="028890_0182_0FDE5DEC67B15C98">
in con&s;iderable quantity, the villous or inner coat of that organ was al&s;o abraded in various places; at the &s;ame time that &s;ome &s;pots appeared on the &s;urface, which were probably the beginnings of mortifications. The &s;uperior portions of the inte&s;tinal canal were generally in a &s;ituation &s;imilar to what I have de|&s;cribed; only it mu&s;t be remembered, that the mor|bid appearances were not yet &s;o far advanced in pro|gre&s;s.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of the body, as it appeared on di&s;&s;ection, throws con&s;iderable light on the nature of the yellow fever. It enables us to explain &s;atisfactorily many of its leading &s;ymptoms; and may even afford u&s;eful hints in the conduct of the cure. It was mentioned above, that the natural heat and vigour of circulation retired from the &s;urface and extremities of the body at a certain period of the di&s;ea&s;e; and that a copious and ob&s;tinate vomiting en&s;ued &s;oon after this change had taken place. The fluid thrown up, which was u&s;ually pituitous, glutinous, or flakey in the begin|ning, acquired, after &s;ome time, a colour of various degrees of blackne&s;s. In quantity, it was often im|moderate, bearing no proportion to the liquor which was drank; a circum&s;tance which could only be explain|ed by the ordinary determination to the &s;urface of the bo|dy being turned upon the internal parts; in con&s;equence of which, there was a preternatural di&s;charge of fluid in|to the cavity of the alimentary canal. Flakes, of a mu|cus or villous nature, were likewi&s;e frequently ob&s;erved in tho&s;e matters which were thrown up by the pa|tient; an appearance which we could not have ea&s;ily accounted for; unle&s;s we had di&s;covered, in examining the dead body, that the inner coat of the &s;tomach was ac|tually abraded; but in what manner this happened, may be difficult to explain. It might either ari&s;e from the repeated action of &s;evere vomiting; or, &s;till more probably, from the preternatural and forcible deter|mination to the exhaling ve&s;&s;els of this cavity, forcing
<PB N="174" REF="028890_0183_0FDD2292F63D25A8">
off &s;ome portions of the villous coat, in the manner of cuticular bli&s;ters. To which explanations I may add, that the black colour of the vomited matter, was evidently owing to a mixture of vitiated bile; the pa&s;&s;age of which might be ea&s;ily traced from the gall duct into the pylorus.</P>
<P>The &s;pecies of the yellow fever, which I have now de&s;cribed, is univer&s;ally acknowledged to be a terrible di&s;ea&s;e; and there are few, I believe, &s;o un|candid, as to boa&s;t of general &s;ucce&s;s in the manner of curing it. A road is therefore left open, not only for improvement, but almo&s;t for total innovation. The only author I have read on the &s;ubject, or the practitioners with whom I am acquainted, do not &s;eem to have extended their views beyond the &s;ymp|toms of the di&s;ea&s;e. There are &s;ome, who, from ob|&s;erving that there is pain of the head and flu&s;hing of the face, recommend bleeding; others, from the pre|&s;ence of nau&s;ea or inclination to vomit, make trial of emetics; and many, from various cau&s;es, in&s;i&s;t on the indi&s;pen&s;ible u&s;e of cathartics. My views, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, are different from tho&s;e of preceding authors. Bleeding was employed occa&s;ionally; emetics were cautiou&s;ly avoided; but time appeared to be too pre|cious to be &s;pent in attending to the effects of cathar|tics, which cannot often be known in le&s;s than twenty-four hours; and which at be&s;t are precarious or fee|ble. In&s;tead, therefore, of attempting to evacuate redundant bile, or to correct it when &s;uppo&s;ed to be vitiated, I exerted my&s;elf, from the fir&s;t moment that I was called to the patient, to change the genius and natural tendency of the di&s;ea&s;e; or, if I may be al|lowed the expre&s;&s;ion, to take the bu&s;ine&s;s, as &s;peedily as po&s;&s;ible, totally out of the hands of nature.</P>
<P>I remark in the fir&s;t place, that I generally began the cure of this &s;pecies of the yellow fever with bleeding. Bleeding was employed in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, chiefly with a view of paving the way to remedies of
<PB N="175" REF="028890_0184_0FDD229A6F31CD68">
greater efficacy. It was, however, found to mode|rate the violence of local pain, particularly the vio|lence of the head-ach, and to be not altogether with|out effect, in retarding the u&s;ual rapid progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e. It has hitherto been thought nece&s;&s;ary, indeed almo&s;t indi&s;pen&s;ible, to empty the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages in this &s;pecies of fever; but time is &s;hort, and the good which accrues from &s;uch evacuations, is not very certain, and often not e&s;&s;ential. It was, therefore, thought &s;ufficient to tru&s;t this intention, for the mo&s;t part, to laxative gly&s;ters; after the employment of which, (bleeding having been premi&s;ed in &s;uch quan|tity as was deemed proper,) the patient was wa&s;hed clean, and bathed in warm water, in as complete a manner as the circum&s;tances of &s;ituation would per|mit. It is needle&s;s to mention, that this was done with a view to increa&s;e mobility of &s;y&s;tem, and to remove &s;pa&s;modic &s;tricture from the extreme ve&s;&s;els of the &s;urface; in con&s;equence of which, greater be|nefit was expected from the application of cold &s;alt-water, which was da&s;hed &s;uddenly from a bucket on the head and &s;houlders. This practice may appear hazardous, to tho&s;e who argue without experience; but I can vouch for its general &s;afety, and bear te&s;ti|mony to its good effects. Sweat, with perfect relief from all the feelings of anxiety and di&s;tre&s;s, was ge|nerally the con&s;equence of this mode of treatment. If employed within the fir&s;t twelve hours from the attack, it &s;eldom failed of removing all the &s;ymptoms of danger: or of effecting a total and complete change in the nature and circum&s;tances of the di&s;ea&s;e; but if the progre&s;s was more advanced, though the &s;ame rule of practice might &s;till be proper, the execution required more boldne&s;s and deci&s;ion. It is only po&s;|&s;ible to judge from the circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e, at this period, of the nece&s;&s;ity or propriety of bleeding, and of emptying the lower inte&s;tines by means of gly&s;ters; but when this bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hall have been ac|compli&s;hed,
<PB N="176" REF="028890_0185_0FDD22BB1E348B40">
in &s;uch manner as may be deemed right, or conducive to the main view, it will be advi&s;eable to &s;have the head, to bathe the whole body in warm water, and in&s;tantly to da&s;h cold water from a bucket on the head and &s;houlders. I have even &s;ometimes, where there was an appearance of greater ob&s;tinacy, ventured to wrap the whole body in a blanket &s;oaked in &s;ea water, or water in which was di&s;&s;olved a large portion of &s;alt. If anxiety was great, or nau&s;ea and vomiting trouble&s;ome, I have al&s;o ob&s;erved benefit from the application of a bli&s;ter to the epiga&s;tric re|gion. Opiates, joined with remedies which had a tendency to determine to the &s;urface, were found to be &s;erviceable; and wine, with a &s;upply of fre&s;h and cool air, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, was highly nece&s;&s;ary. This method of proceeding will, perhaps, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e thought un|warrantable; but I can &s;peak confidently of its &s;afety; and I may farther add, that unle&s;s &s;ome decided &s;teps are taken to change the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e, during the continuance of this &s;tage, our future endeavours to do good, will generally be in vain. I have hitherto promi&s;ed &s;ucce&s;s in the cure of this fever, with a good deal of confidence; but if it &s;hould &s;o happen, that we are not called to the patient till the yellow|ne&s;s has &s;pread over the whole of the body, or till <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> black vomiting has begun to make its appearance, the pro&s;pect, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, is then very dark. The ordinary re&s;ources of our art are feeble; and if good can be done at all, it can only be done by means, which in the common opinion of practitioners, bor|der on ra&s;hne&s;s. In this latter &s;tage of the com|plaint, &s;o great a degree of torpor overwhelms the powers of life, that remedies do not produce their u&s;ual effect, and our labour is often the &s;ame, as if we attempted to re&s;u&s;citate a corp&s;e. I have, how|ever, &s;een in&s;tances of &s;uch unexpected recoveries from the mo&s;t hopele&s;s &s;tate in fevers, that I &s;eldom totally de&s;pair as long as life remains. I know that
<PB N="177" REF="028890_0186_0FDD22BE7904A248">
death may be prevented, even after black vomiting has appeared with all its terrors, if a remedy can be found powerful enough to excite the action of the extreme ve&s;&s;els, and to recall the determination to the &s;urface of the body. For this purpo&s;e, I have employed alternately warm and cold bathing with &s;ucce&s;s. I have even wrapt the body, as I mention|ed before, in a blanket, &s;oaked in water, in which a large portion of &s;alt was di&s;&s;olved, or which had been &s;teeped in brandy or rum, enjoining at the &s;ame time the liberal u&s;e of wine, or even more powerful cor|dials. I have heard of &s;ome well-atte&s;ted in&s;tances, where plentiful draughts of rum and water, have checked the vomiting, and apparently &s;aved the lives of patients, after the medical people had given them up for lo&s;t.</P>
<P>I have now mentioned the method of cure which I pur&s;ued in the yellow fever of Jamaica; and I mu&s;t be allowed to add, that the general indication ap|pears to be confirmed by a view of the hi&s;tory and progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e, as al&s;o by con&s;idering the ap|pearances which are found after death. It was ob|&s;erved in the preceding pages, that the circulation became languid at a certain period in the cour&s;e of this fever, and that the determination was, in fact, turned upon the internal parts, particularly upon the alimentary canal, and biliary &s;y&s;tem. To &s;upport, therefore, or to recall the determination to the &s;ur|face, where it had begun to retire, was the princi|pal aim which was kept in view. It was pur&s;ued with vigour; and, I have the &s;atisfaction to add, fre|quently with &s;ucce&s;s. I am afraid that the means may be thought hazardous; but I have never yet per|ceived from them, even a momentary harm. I &s;hall not therefore cea&s;e to recommend them, till I find that others have tried them fairly, and found them dangerous or ineffectual.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION II.</HEAD>
<P>IN the preceding pages, I attempted to de&s;cribe the di&s;ea&s;e, which has been u&s;ually regarded as the proper yellow fever of the We&s;t-Indies, detailing at the &s;ame time, the particular &s;teps of a method of cure, which I have cau&s;e to believe, was followed with more than ordinary &s;ucce&s;s. I now proceed to con&s;ider another &s;pecies of di&s;order, which frequently makes its appearance among people newly arrived in hot countries, and which, from &s;ome &s;triking marks of affinity, I have been induced to rank as a &s;pecies, or variety of the former. Yellowne&s;s, indeed, is not by any means common to it, and black vomiting is actually rare; yet paroxy&s;ms and remi&s;&s;ions are &s;carcely di&s;tingui&s;hable, and the difference between it and the preceding, is perhaps, in fact, only acci|dental.</P>
<P>I remarked before, that this &s;pecies of di&s;ea&s;e, as well as the yellow fever, properly &s;o called, appears but rarely among tho&s;e who have re&s;ided any length of time in tropical climates. It was ob&s;erved to begin, as fevers u&s;ually do, with di&s;agreeable affec|tion of the &s;tomach, with languor, debility, and pain of the head. The horror of &s;hivering, &s;o common in the commencement of febrile di&s;ea&s;es, was &s;eldom great in degree; but it often la&s;ted long, and &s;ome|times was accompanied with unu&s;ual feelings. The pul&s;e was generally &s;mall, frequent, and ea&s;ily com|pre&s;&s;ed; the eyes were watery, muddy, or inflamed; the features were confu&s;ed, and the countenance was &s;ometimes flu&s;hed: the thir&s;t was &s;eldom great; and the heat of the &s;kin was u&s;ually moderate; but a deep and heavy &s;ighing, a hurried re&s;piration, with an inconceivable di&s;tre&s;s and anxiety about the prae|cordia, gave &s;trong indications of the nature of the complaint.&mdash;In &s;ome in&s;tances I have known &s;uch
<PB N="179" REF="028890_0188_0FDD22C6308F0BA8">
&s;evere and excruciating &s;pa&s;ms, as, in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;eemed, to &s;u&s;pend the ordinary functions of life.</P>
<P>In twelve hours, or le&s;s, there was often &s;ome abatement in the violence of tho&s;e &s;ymptoms; but &s;eldom &s;uch material relief, as, with any degree of ju&s;|tice, could be called a remi&s;&s;ion. The &s;kin became cool, and &s;ometimes moi&s;t; yet there &s;carcely ever was any &s;weat. The pul&s;e became fuller, and often le&s;s frequent; the re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s and anxiety were &s;ome|times &s;en&s;ibly dimini&s;hed; and the local pain often abated; but this re&s;pite was neither long, nor of cer|tain duration. In a few hours, all the &s;ymptoms returned with aggravation. The eyes became more muddy; the countenance more confu&s;ed; the head-ach, and other pains increa&s;ed, together with &s;en&s;a|tions of anxiety, and re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, hurried re&s;piration, and deep and heavy &s;ighing. The pul&s;e was now more frequent, &s;maller and harder; the thir&s;t was increa&s;ed, with nau&s;ea, and &s;ometimes with vomiting. The vomiting was &s;eldom bilious: it was not often, indeed, that the matter thrown up, was altered from what had been drank, unle&s;s by having acquired an additional degree of ropine&s;s.&mdash;To the above &s;ymp|toms was &s;ometimes added an ob&s;tinate co&s;tivene&s;s, &s;ometimes &s;uch a degree of purging and griping, as might ea&s;ily be mi&s;taken for proper dy&s;entery.</P>
<P>As the di&s;ea&s;e advanced in its progre&s;s, the abate|ment of the violence of &s;ymptoms, which at fir&s;t was &s;ometimes perceived towards the mornings, became gradually le&s;s and le&s;s perceptible, and at la&s;t was &s;carcely to be di&s;tingui&s;hed. The anxiety and re&s;t|le&s;&s;ne&s;s were now particularly di&s;tre&s;&s;ing; the &s;kin was &s;ometimes dry, though oftener moi&s;t, and in point of heat below the ordinary temperature of health; while it gave the idea to the per&s;on who felt it, as if there was a powerful &s;pa&s;m &s;ub&s;i&s;ting on the &s;urface. I may likewi&s;e remark in this place, that a beautiful red colour of the cheeks, together with a &s;mooth|ne&s;s
<PB N="180" REF="028890_0189_0FDD22C764CB4020">
and cherry plumpne&s;s of the lips, was frequently ob&s;erved towards the latter periods of the di&s;ea&s;e. Yellowne&s;s, as was mentioned before, was &s;eldom &s;een, unle&s;s in the very la&s;t &s;tage of the illne&s;s; and vomiting of black, or even bilious matter was ex|tremely rare. There was, however, at all times, a great di&s;po&s;ition to faint, with more or le&s;s of a cer|tain &s;pecies of low delirium.</P>
<P>The cour&s;e of this &s;pecies of the di&s;ea&s;e, was le&s;s rapid, than the cour&s;e of that which terminates in black vomiting; the termination of the one being often protracted to the eighth or ninth day, that of the other &s;eldom exceeding the fourth or fifth. The marks of cri&s;is, as was ob&s;erved before, were rarely di&s;coverable in the fir&s;t &s;pecies of the yellow fever. They were likewi&s;e ob&s;cure in the pre&s;ent, and I cannot pretend to &s;peak with confidence, of the in|fluence of critical days. Where the termination was favourable, the pul&s;e became gradually &s;tronger, and le&s;s confined in its &s;troke; the &s;kin likewi&s;e became &s;ofter, while the impre&s;&s;ion, which it made on the hand that felt it, communicated an idea that the cir|culation was more vigorous, and the &s;pa&s;m on the &s;urface le&s;s ob&s;tinate; the eye and countenance like|wi&s;e brightened up; the anxiety and re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s va|ni&s;hed or decrea&s;ed, and &s;ome appetite for food re|turned; but it was often difficult to mark the point of time preci&s;ely, at which this change took place.&mdash;It may be ob&s;erved likewi&s;e, where the termination was fatal, that death approached in two different ways. A patient, apparently po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of vigour, was &s;ometimes &s;uddenly &s;eized with coma or convul|&s;ions, and died unexpectedly; but it happened more frequently, that the powers of life were gradually and &s;lowly extingui&s;hed; the pul&s;e became weaker and more confined in its &s;troke; while the natural heat and circulation retired by degrees from the &s;urface and extremities of the body.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="028890_0190_0FDD22EDABF47100">
The cure of this &s;pecies of the di&s;ea&s;e, though by no means ea&s;y, was le&s;s difficult upon the whole than that of the former. In&s;tead of the torpor and in&s;en|&s;ibility, which prevailed in the latter periods of the proper yellow fever, the mobility of the nervous &s;y&s;|tem was &s;o much increa&s;ed in the pre&s;ent &s;pecies of di&s;ea&s;e, that remedies &s;eldom failed of producing &s;en|&s;ible effects: and wherever remedies produce effects, it generally is in our power to manage the bu&s;ine&s;s in &s;uch manner, that &s;ome good may ari&s;e. It may be ob&s;erved in the fir&s;t place, with regard to the cure, that bleeding, which frequently was u&s;eful in the former &s;pecies, was generally hurtful in the pre&s;ent; and that in&s;tead of retarding, it oftener accelerated the progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e. Emetics were employed very commonly by the practitioners of the We&s;t Indies, in this as in other ca&s;es of fever; but I cannot help remarking, that languor and debility, frequently yellowne&s;s, and &s;ometimes a continual vomiting, which no remedies could re&s;train, were often the con|&s;equence of antimonial emetics of &s;evere operation; and I have no doubt in &s;aying, that the approach of death was actually ha&s;tened, in &s;everal in&s;tances, by this method of treatment. Laxatives were occa|&s;ionally of &s;ervice; but the &s;tronger purgatives were frequently hurtful. Bli&s;ters were often extremely beneficial; but it requires care and di&s;cernment to apply them in the proper circum&s;tances, &s;o as to reap the full advantage. Opiates were &s;ometimes &s;erviceable, and bark and wine, in mo&s;t in&s;tances, were remedies of great value; but the principal tru&s;t was placed in warm and cold bathing; which, under proper management, &s;eldom failed of an&s;wering every expectation completely, or &s;peedily, of removing the chief &s;ymptoms of danger. Sometimes it appeared to cut &s;hort the cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e abruptly.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION III.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE now de&s;cribed two &s;pecies of a fever, which &s;eems to be, in &s;ome degree, peculiar to the natives of northern regions, &s;oon after their ar|rival in the We&s;t-Indies. In the one, a determina|tion to the alimentary canal and biliary organs, with marks of putre&s;cent tendency in the general ma&s;s of fluids, was di&s;coverable at an early period; in the other, the brain and nervous &s;y&s;tem were more par|ticularly and principally affected; while the &s;pecies, of which I now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> give &s;ome account, ex|hibited &s;trong marks of va&s;cular excitement, with a very high degree of the apparent inflammatory dia|the&s;is. This was more irregular in its appearances and more complicated in its nature, than the others. The marks of inflammatory diathe&s;is were generally very apparent in the beginning; but they u&s;ually gave way or became complicated in the latter &s;tages, with &s;ymptoms of putre&s;cency or nervous affection. In de&s;cribing the hi&s;tory of this di&s;ea&s;e, it may not be &s;uperfluous to remark, that there is &s;eldom any thing particular in the &s;en&s;ations of debility and hor|ror, which precede the formation of the paroxy&s;m. The hot fit was generally ob&s;erved to run high; the heat was often inten&s;e; the pul&s;e, which was quick, frequent and irregular, vibrated often in an uncommon manner, and with an u&s;ual degree of force; the thir&s;t was &s;ometimes immoderate, &s;ome|times not greatly increa&s;ed; the countenance was flu&s;hed; the eye gli&s;tened, and appeared frequently to be in &s;ome degree inflamed; the &s;igns of excite|ment were in general uncommonly high; yet the di&s;po&s;ition to faint was &s;ometimes &s;udden and unex|pected. It de&s;erves farther to be remarked, that blood drawn from the arm did not commonly exhi|bit the u&s;ual buffy appearance of real inflammatory
<PB N="183" REF="028890_0192_0FDE5B3146836778">
diathe&s;is; and though times of aggravation and al|leviation were often di&s;cernible; yet they did not happen at regular and &s;tated periods.</P>
<P>It was ob&s;erved frequently, that many of the lead|ing circum&s;tances &s;uffered a material change, about the third day of the di&s;ea&s;e. The &s;ymptoms of high inflammatory diathe&s;is, which prevailed in the begin|ning, became mixed, more or le&s;s, with &s;ymptoms of putre&s;cency, or nervous affection. Delirium made its appearance; &s;ometimes it ran high, with &s;tartings and &s;ymptoms of violent excitement; &s;ometimes there was a low and muttering incoherence with marks of languor and debility. The gums turned red and &s;pungy, and &s;ometimes bled; the thir&s;t was frequently inten&s;e, the tongue dry, with vomiting and &s;evere retching; yet vomiting of bilious or vitiated matters was a rare occurrence. The above &s;ymptoms gene|rally went on to increa&s;e, during the &s;pace of &s;ix or &s;even days, about which period the powers of life either yielded to the di&s;ea&s;e, or &s;igns of recovery be|gan to appear: the marks of cri&s;is, however, were &s;eldom di&s;tinct and final; neither was the influence of critical days &s;o much to be depended upon as in the common remitting fever of the country.</P>
<P>It was mentioned above, that the nature of this fever was more complicated than that of the two for|mer; &s;o the indications of cure are likewi&s;e more dif|ficult and perplexed. If we proceed on the fir&s;t ob|vious view of the di&s;ea&s;e, we &s;hall often do irreparable mi&s;chief by copious and repeated evacuations; yet there will not be le&s;s danger, on the other hand, if, regardle&s;s of the pre&s;ent degree of excitement, we in|dulge freely in the u&s;e of &s;timulants. It is nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve a middle cour&s;e; and I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that it is &s;ometimes difficult to do any thing, without doing harm. Bleeding was frequently employed in the cure of this di&s;ea&s;e, and in mo&s;t ca&s;es, it was a u&s;eful remedy, though le&s;s perhaps from its own
<PB N="184" REF="028890_0193_0FDE5B3A9F2A87E8">
effects merely, than from paving the way to other more powerful applications. It is, however, capa|ble of being ea&s;ily carried to exce&s;s; and ought not to be tru&s;ted to wholly for the removing of the irri|tability, and high degree of excitement, which pre|vails &s;o generally in the beginning of this di&s;ea&s;e. After bleeding, emetics and cathartics are employed very freely. I have always profe&s;&s;ed my&s;elf an ene|my to the practice of giving emetics in the fevers of Jamaica; yet, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that antimonials were not only &s;afer, but of more particular &s;ervice in this, than in any other &s;pecies of fever, where I have &s;een them tried. Among the great variety of forms which have been recommended by practitioners, for the purpo&s;e of emptying the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages, I have not found any one an&s;wer &s;o well, as a thin &s;olution of the &s;al-catharticum, given at different intervals, with a &s;mall portion of emetic tartar, and &s;ometimes with the addition of laudanum. The operation of this remedy was exten&s;ive. It might be &s;o managed, as to promote nau&s;ea or vomiting, &s;weat, or moderate evacuations downwards; at the &s;ame time that it proved very powerfully &s;edative. I may likewi&s;e add, that I have &s;ometimes found benefit from nitre, camphire and opium, given in pretty large do&s;es, and accompanied with plentiful dilution. But though the&s;e remedies were often &s;erviceable, and contributed in many ca&s;es to moderate the high degree of irrita|bility, yet the chief dependence of the cure was much better tru&s;ted to cold bathing. After the &s;urface of the body had been &s;ufficiently relaxed, by the previous u&s;e of warm bathing and fomentations, the effects of cold bathing were wonderful. The exce&s;&s;ive irrita|bility was moderated or removed, and the powers of life were invigorated in a very &s;ingular manner in con&s;equence of it.</P>
<P>I have attempted in the preceding pages, to give a &s;hort view of a di&s;ea&s;e, which has not, I believe,
<PB N="185" REF="028890_0194_0FDE5B41A32F1480">
been hitherto very accurately de&s;cribed by authors' or treated with much &s;ucce&s;s in practice. It is a di&s;ea&s;e of a continued kind; and, as I &s;aid before, in &s;ome degree peculiar to the natives of northern lati|tudes, &s;oon after their arrival in the tropical climates. I cannot help thinking, that it may be ea&s;ily di&s;tin|gui&s;hed, even in the fir&s;t hours of its attack, from the intermitting or remitting fever, which is the common endemic of hot countries: but I mu&s;t at the &s;ame time add, that this di&s;tinction does not re&s;ide in the pre&s;ence or ab&s;ence of one individual &s;ymptom. The &s;tate of the pul&s;e, indeed, conveys information, that the di&s;ea&s;e is not of the kind which has paroxy&s;ms and remi&s;&s;ions: yet this information can only be ob|tained from a knowledge and actual compari&s;on of the two di&s;ea&s;es:&mdash;I do not pretend to de&s;cribe it in words. The &s;tate of the eye and countenance, was likewi&s;e ob&s;erved to be &s;trongly de&s;criptive of the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e; as al&s;o were the deep and heavy &s;ighing, the hurried re&s;piration, the anxiety and re&s;t|le&s;&s;ne&s;s, with a certain uncomfortablene&s;s of &s;en&s;ation, which no words can expre&s;s; but I confe&s;s my&s;elf, at the &s;ame time, perfectly at a lo&s;s to fix on any one &s;ingle &s;ymptom, which appearing at an early period, di&s;criminated it with certainty from all other fevers. I have de&s;cribed it under three di&s;tinct and &s;eparate forms; but I mu&s;t al&s;o add, that they may &s;ometimes be found to be more complicated with each other, than they appear to be in the above de&s;cription.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. INTERMITTING FEVER OF AMERICA.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING endeavoured in the preceding treati&s;e, to give a more accurate hi&s;tory of the endemic fever of Jamaica, than is met with in books, and I am di&s;po&s;ed to flatter my&s;elf, having pointed out a more &s;ucce&s;sful method of cure than that which has been generally pur&s;ued; I &s;hall now add a few ob&s;ervations on the intermitting fever of America; a di&s;ea&s;e, in which my experience has been tolerably exten&s;ive. The frequent occurrence of intermitting fevers in every climate, together with the full and ample man|ner in which the di&s;ea&s;e has been treated of by many learned and ingenious writers, excu&s;es me from en|tering into a minute and full di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the &s;ubject. I &s;hall therefore employ only a few pages in attempt|ing to illu&s;trate particulars in the hi&s;tory of the di&s;|ea&s;e, which have been &s;uperficially noticed; or to ex|plain &s;ome points of treatment, which, though not new, I have ventured to carry farther than is u&s;ual in com|mon practice. As I had the opportunity of attending to the hi&s;tory of the intermitting fever in &s;everal of the &s;outhern provinces of the continent of North Ame|rica, I &s;hall fir&s;t mention the more con&s;tant and ge|neral cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, and afterwards point out tho&s;e circum&s;tances of peculiarity, which &s;eemed to ari&s;e from the difference of climate, or from the influ|ence of the &s;ea&s;on of the year. I &s;hall likewi&s;e occa|&s;ionally take notice of the general &s;tate of health of the troops who were employed on the &s;ame expedition,
<PB N="187" REF="028890_0196_0FDE5B4F46478B40">
though I mu&s;t al&s;o add, that I can only pretend to trace the progre&s;s of the fever with accuracy, in the regiment in which I had the honour to &s;erve.</P>
<P>I &s;hall attempt, in the fir&s;t place, to give an accurate de&s;cription of the paroxy&s;m of an intermitting fever, marking as carefully as I can, the order of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, in which the &s;ymptoms mo&s;t u&s;ually appear. We are taught by the de&s;criptions of mo&s;t writers, to con|&s;ider languor and debility as the fir&s;t feeling or fir&s;t e&s;&s;ential &s;ymptom in the paroxy&s;m of an intermitting fever; but I cannot avoid remarking, that an unu&s;ual affection at &s;tomach, a flatulence,&mdash;in &s;hort, &s;omething di&s;agreeable, which I cannot ea&s;ily define, but which was accompanied in many ca&s;es with head-ach, and &s;ometimes with drowzine&s;s, preceded every &s;en&s;ation of languor or debility in mo&s;t ca&s;es, where my ob&s;er|vations were made with &s;uch care that they could be tru&s;ted to. I may al&s;o farther ob&s;erve, that, as &s;oon as this languor or debility began to be perceived, the veins began to &s;ub&s;ide, the nails turned pale, and at la&s;t blue; the &s;kin of cour&s;e was dry and con&s;tricted; and there was &s;ometimes an evident diminution of hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, particularly of the heat of the extremities. To the&s;e &s;ymptoms was often added, a di&s;agreeable kind of yawning, with &s;trong &s;en&s;ations of wearine&s;s, and an irre&s;i&s;tible inclination to &s;tretch the limbs. A &s;en&s;ation of cold was now felt in the back, as if water ran down upon it in &s;eparate &s;treams. It &s;oon va|ni&s;hed, indeed; but &s;uddenly returned again in a more violent degree; in which manner it went on, cea&s;ing for an in&s;tant, and then recurring with aggravated vio|lence, till the whole body became at la&s;t affected with rigour or &s;haking, accompanied, in a more e&s;pecial manner, with chattering of the teeth. The coldne&s;s having now arrived at its acme, or highe&s;t point of inten&s;ity, glowings of heat were perceived in the inter|vals between the rigors or &s;ucce&s;&s;ions. The&s;e glowings grew gradually &s;tronger, and continuing for a greater
<PB N="188" REF="028890_0197_0FDE60822475CD20">
length of time, at lea&s;t bani&s;hed every &s;en&s;ation of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">old. The heat, which now &s;ucceeded, was often much above the temperature of health; marks of fe|ver &s;ometimes ran high; the veins became full<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the face was flu&s;hed, and the &s;urface of the body bore marks of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. The duration of this &s;tate was uncertain: &s;ometimes it did not continue the &s;pace of one hour, &s;ometimes it la&s;ted four or five. A damp|ne&s;s at fir&s;t began to appear on the forehead and brea&s;t, which extending it&s;elf gradually to the extremi|ties, was at lea&s;t formed into a &s;weat; in con&s;equence of which, the fever gradually &s;ub&s;ided, and the body returned nearly to its natural &s;tate.</P>
<P>The above are the mo&s;t u&s;ual &s;ymptoms of the pa|roxy&s;ms of an intermitting fever. I have de&s;cribed them in the order of time in which they mo&s;t u&s;ually ap|pear. I mu&s;t however remark, that &s;ymptoms are &s;ometimes ob&s;erved different from tho&s;e which I have now taken notice of; as al&s;o, that the order of &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion, which I have mentioned, is not, by any means fixed and invariable. It is impo&s;&s;ible to deny the common ob&s;ervation, that languor or debility is a ge|neral and early &s;ymptom in almo&s;t every &s;pecies of fever; but it is likewi&s;e certain, that there are many in&s;tances, where it is not in our power to perceive its actual pre&s;ence. It is therefore precipitate to con|clude with Dr. Cullen, that all the future phaeno|mena depend upon this, as their e&s;&s;ential and original cau&s;e. There may frequently be deception in at|tempts to de&s;cribe the &s;ituation of others; but that which we feel our&s;elves is more to be tru&s;ted to:&mdash;and I can affirm, that I have often felt &s;en&s;ations of cold in my own per&s;on, previous to every feeling of languor or debility; previous, I might even &s;ome|times &s;ay, to any perceptible deviation from a &s;tate of health. But be&s;ides, that the exi&s;tence or perception of languor and debility, does not &s;eem to be e&s;&s;en|tial to the exi&s;tence of a paroxy&s;m of intermitting
<PB N="189" REF="028890_0198_0FDE5EC72960C9E8">
fever, I may likewi&s;e add, that I have &s;een in&s;tances; particularly in the hot months of &s;ummer, where the whole of this di&s;ea&s;e pa&s;&s;ed over, without the lea&s;t perceptible degree of a previous cold fit. It happen|ed &s;ometimes al&s;o, that during the continuance of the paroxy&s;m, there was &s;carcely any ob&s;ervable di&s;order in the pul&s;e, or any material &s;igns of external fever. The tumult and unea&s;ine&s;s, which terminate in mo&s;t ca&s;es by &s;weat, went off in &s;ome by urine or &s;tool, or perhaps declined in others, without the appearance of any preternatural evacuation. In like manner it was commonly ob&s;erved, in the di&s;ea&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of partial intermittent, that there was not any perception of cold, nor increa&s;e of heat; no di&s;order in the pul&s;e, or preternatural evacuation; in &s;hort, not a &s;ymptom, which characterizes the ge|nius of the di&s;ea&s;e, except local pain, which continu|ing for a certain time, di&s;appears, and then returns again at a &s;tated hour. To this we may add, that there are various in&s;tances, where the whole duration of a complaint, which indi&s;putably depends on the cau&s;e of intermitting fever, is occupied by a coma|to&s;e di&s;po&s;ition, by convul&s;ions, or even by tetanic affection. If we therefore con&s;ider the&s;e phaenomena attentively, we &s;hall find little cau&s;e to believe, that the mo&s;t u&s;ual &s;ymptoms of the intermitting fever, are &s;ymptoms without which the di&s;ea&s;e cannot exi&s;t; or that they are mutually the cau&s;e and effect of each other. The order of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion I have ob&s;erved is not fixed invariably; and ca&s;es are numerous, where tho&s;e &s;ymptoms, which &s;ome authors have con&s;idered as ab&s;olutely e&s;&s;ential, do not appear at all. This fact is certain; and we may &s;afely conclude from it, that the main hinge of action in a paroxy&s;m of fever has not been yet di&s;covered.</P>
<P>The vital and natural functions are variou&s;ly af|fected, not only in different people, but in the &s;ame per&s;on, in the different &s;tages of a paroxy&s;m of the
<PB N="190" REF="028890_0199_0FDD2295EA92D978">
&s;ame fever. The pul&s;e, in the fir&s;t approach, is of|ten remarked to be flower than natural, &s;ometimes it is more languid and weak. It &s;oon however becomes more frequent, though it continues for the mo&s;t part &s;mall and contracted, till the latter &s;tage of the cold fit. It then u&s;ually acquires &s;trength and &s;ome de|gree of fulne&s;s, &s;ometimes greater frequ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ncy and hardine&s;s; but as the &s;weat begins to flow, the hand|ne&s;s and frequency abate, while the fulne&s;s increa&s;es; &s;o that it returns by degrees nearly to its natural &s;tate. The di&s;agreeable affection of &s;tomach, (which I for|merly ob&s;erved was &s;ometimes the fir&s;t perceptible &s;ymptom of a paroxy&s;m of the intermitting fever) in|crea&s;es frequently to nau&s;ea or retching, &s;ometimes to &s;evere and continual vomiting; which does not cea&s;e till &s;weating has become general all over the body. The re&s;piration, which in the beginning of the paroxy&s;m, is u&s;ually flow, and &s;ometimes inter|rupted with &s;ighing, in the progre&s;s of the hot fit becomes frequent, laborious and high. It often hap|pens, likewi&s;e, that there is more than ordinary dul|ne&s;s of perception in the mental faculties in the fir&s;t approach of the fever; while this is often &s;ucceeded by extraordinary acutene&s;s in the more advanced &s;tages, particularly during the continuance of the hot fit. But though it is only during this period that excitement and delirium are ob&s;erved to be common; yet in&s;tances are not wanting, where derangement of intellect is among the fir&s;t &s;ymptoms of the di&s;ea&s;e, and where it continues among the principal through|out the whole of the cour&s;e. To the above appear|ances we may add, that the urine, which is thin and pale in the fir&s;t &s;tage, becomes high coloured in the progre&s;s of the hot fit; and as the &s;weating advances, thick and turbid, frequently with the addition of a copious lateritious &s;ediment.</P>
<P>I remarked formerly, in treating of the remitting fever of Jamaica, that certain hours of attack were
<PB N="191" REF="028890_0200_0FDE5ECD158BB388">
in a very peculiar manner connected with the dif|ferent types or forms of that di&s;ea&s;e; but I cannot pretend to &s;ay, that the &s;ame rules were ob&s;erved to hold good, with any degree of certainty in the inter|mitting fever of America. Single tertians, indeed, began mo&s;t u&s;ually about twelve; though there were likewi&s;e many in&s;tances where they came on &s;o early as ten in the morning, or &s;o late as two in the after|noon. The other forms were &s;till le&s;s regular. It was al&s;o taken notice of, that anticipations were common in the &s;ingle tertian of Jamaica; as al&s;o that they were irregular and long. In America they were &s;till more frequent; but &s;eldom exceeded one or two hours at once. They often, however, pre|vailed to a certain acme, or point in the di&s;ea&s;e, ob|&s;erving a regular interval of time in their progre&s;s. It &s;ometimes likewi&s;e happened, that the type po&s;t|poned gradually, till the complaint di&s;appeared finally, This, however, was much more rare than the other.</P>
<P>Having mentioned, in the preceding pages, &s;ome general re&s;emblances of the intermitting fever of Ame|rica, I &s;hall next trace its peculiarities in the dif|ferent provinces, in which the regiment to which I belonged, had the fortune to &s;erve. I may ob&s;erve, in the fir&s;t place, that I joined the fir&s;t battalion of the 71&s;t regiment, on York I&s;land, in the beginning of the &s;ummer 1778. Few of the men were then &s;ick; neither did the number increa&s;e materially, till towards the latter end of June. The intermittents, which appeared previous to this period, were gene|rally &s;ingle tertian; and of perfectly ea&s;y treatment. In the month of July, a dy&s;entery, of a very particular kind, became epidemic, and the &s;poradic intermittent in&s;tantly vani&s;hed. The &s;tools in this complaint were numerous and bloody, the gripings were &s;evere, but there was &s;eldom any very material di&s;order in the pul&s;e. The di&s;ea&s;e did not often terminate in le&s;s than &s;even days; &s;ometimes it continued a
<PB N="192" REF="028890_0201_0FDD22996DFB2610">
fortnight or longer. The ordinary treatment was very rarely of benefit; yet the complaint was of a nature &s;o little dangerous, that I do not recollect a &s;ingle per&s;on who died of it. It di&s;appeared totally about the beginning of Augu&s;t, or rather changed into an epidemic intermittent, the type of which was u&s;ually &s;ingle tertian. The paroxy&s;ms of this fever were regular, the intermi&s;&s;ions were di&s;tinct; and its nature was &s;o far from being ob&s;tinate, that I &s;carcely met with an in&s;tance which re&s;i&s;ted the Peruvian bark, where that remedy was given in &s;ufficient quantity. This fever continued highly epidemic during the months of Augu&s;t and September. The frequency of new attacks was con&s;iderably dimini&s;hed in the month of October; yet &s;uch as happened then, were generally accompanied with dangerous and alarming &s;ymptoms. Relap&s;es were common. But though the intermitting fever of this i&s;land was epi|demic in a con&s;iderable degree, it was not by any means of a fatal nature. If neglected in the begin|ning, foundation was &s;ometimes laid for ob&s;tinate complaints; but the di&s;ea&s;e was not fatal in its proper form to any one patient, who remained with the regiment. I cannot &s;peak with certainty of the i&s;&s;ue of a few of the wor&s;t ca&s;es, which were &s;ent to the General Ho&s;pital, on the breaking up of the encamp|ment in the month of November. The regiment was then embarked in tran&s;ports, on an expedition to the &s;outhward. The &s;ick were collected into one &s;hip, which, after a &s;tormy and tedious pa&s;&s;age, arrived with the re&s;t of the fleet at Savanna, in Georgia, in the latter end of December. The voyage had an excellent effect on the health of the men. Out of a hundred and twenty convale&s;cents, who embarked at New York, in the month of November, not a man died; and there only remained two, who were unfit for the &s;ervice of the field, on the day of our arrival in the Savanna river. During the months of January,
<PB N="193" REF="028890_0202_0FDE5ED907716540">
February and March, the battalion of the regiment in which I &s;erved, was a total &s;tranger to &s;ickne&s;s. It was employed in long and almo&s;t continual march|ing, till the latter end of April, when, encamping at Ebenezer, on the Savanna river, the intermitting fever &s;oon made its appearance, and &s;pread &s;o rapidly, that before the end of June, very few remained, not only in this regiment, but even in the garri&s;on, who had not &s;uffered more or le&s;s from this raging di&s;ea&s;e. It was commonly remarked in the hi&s;tory of this fever, that the type during the month of May, was u&s;ually &s;ingle tertian, till the fifth or &s;ixth day; after which, paroxy&s;ms were often ob&s;erved daily, though generally unequal in force and duration: that is, the di&s;ea&s;e changed about this period, to a double tertian form. But though this was ob&s;erved to be the ca&s;e, during the greate&s;t part of May, the type of the fever was u&s;ually double tertian, or quotidian, from its very commencement, in the month of June. The di&s;ea&s;e was then of the mo&s;t ardent kind. The pa|roxy&s;ms were &s;eldom u&s;hered in by a cold fit; and the remi&s;&s;ions, for the mo&s;t part, were very indi&s;tinct and imperfect. The heat of the weather was exce&s;|&s;ive, during the greate&s;t part of the month; and &s;trange and alarming &s;ymptoms occurred frequently in the cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e. In &s;ome ca&s;es a comato&s;e di&s;po&s;ition, approaching to apoplexy, or rigid &s;pa&s;ms, re&s;embling a perfect tetanus, occupied the greate&s;t part of the paroxy&s;m; in others there were various local pains, deliria, bilious vomitings or purgings, with a multitude of other affections, which appeared on a &s;uperficial view to con&s;titute the whole of the complaint. Yet the&s;e, &s;ymptoms declining after &s;ome continuance, recurred again at a &s;tated hour, and were finally removed, or at lea&s;t &s;u&s;pended, by the Peruvian bark. I left the garri&s;on of Ebenezer in the beginning of July, and went directly to Savanna, where the &s;ame epidemic prevailed, though in a de|gree
<PB N="194" REF="028890_0203_0FDE5E0F62192BF8">
of le&s;s frequency, and with &s;ymptoms of a le&s;s alarming nature than at the above-mentioned place. At Savanna, it u&s;ually retained marks of di&s;tinct in|termi&s;&s;ion, and its type was often of the &s;ingle tertian kind&mdash;in &s;hort, it was &s;imilar to the fever of Ebenezer in the month of May. From Savanna, I went to Beaufort in the beginning of Augu&s;t. The fever, which u&s;ually prevails at this &s;ea&s;on of the year, in all the &s;outhern provinces of North America, was then epidemic among the troops who were &s;tationed on this i&s;land. The type, however, was &s;till more com|monly &s;ingle tertian here, than at Savanna. The be|ginning of the paroxy&s;ms was likewi&s;e more gene|rally di&s;tingui&s;hed by a cold fit; and the intermi&s;&s;ions, for the mo&s;t part, were more perfect and di&s;tinct. In a few ca&s;es, indeed, marks of malignity were di&s;|coverable; yet the di&s;ea&s;e, upon the whole, was not of a fatal nature, or of ob&s;tinate cure; though unle&s;s &s;peedily checked by bark, it often degenerated into dy&s;entery or drop&s;y, which were not only removed with difficulty, but in the circum&s;tances under which we laboured, were often of very precarious i&s;&s;ue. This epidemic was &s;till acquiring force, when the outpo&s;ts were &s;ummoned to the defence of Savanna. Its progre&s;s was, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;u&s;pended during the active &s;ervice of the &s;iege. The enemy, however, had no &s;ooner retired from before the place, than a fever began to rage with violence, which carried off prodigious numbers, particularly of the foreign troops. It was ob&s;erved in the hi&s;tory of the preceding year, that few were attacked afre&s;h with the intermitting fever on York I&s;land, &s;o late as the months of October and November; but it was likewi&s;e remarked, that, where the di&s;ea&s;e happened at tho&s;e periods, the &s;ymp|toms were oftener malignant or dangerous. The &s;ame was in &s;ome re&s;pects the ca&s;e at Savanna. The fever, which made its appearance after the &s;iege, was or an alarming and violent kind. Marks of di&s;tinct
<PB N="195" REF="028890_0204_0FDE5EE4A3709DD8">
intermi&s;&s;ion were &s;eldom di&s;coverable, delirium was a common &s;ymptom, &s;pa&s;modic affections were &s;ome|times violent, and the cour&s;e of the di&s;order was ge|nerally rapid. The rage of this epidemic cea&s;ed in December; but relap&s;es continued to return occa|&s;ionally, during the following winter; which was an unu&s;ually &s;evere one in that &s;outhern latitude.</P>
<P>There likewi&s;e &s;till remained &s;ome dy&s;enteric com|plaints, which re&s;i&s;ted every mode of treatment that could be devi&s;ed. They yielded however to the re|turn of the warm, weather, a&s;&s;i&s;ted, in no &s;mall degree perhaps, by the active &s;ervice of the &s;iege of Charle&s;|town. The recovery, indeed, was &s;o complete, that, in the beginning of June, the whole of the regiment arrived at Camden in perfect health. The fir&s;t bat|talion was &s;ent to occupy a po&s;t at the Cheraws, on the river Pedee. The di&s;tance is &s;eventy-five miles; yet &s;uch was the &s;pirit and activity of the men, that they performed the march in three days, without fatigue or inconvenience. An open field, between four and five hundred paces from the bank of the river, was cho&s;en for the encampment of this battalion; while a &s;ituation perfectly dry and cleared of wood, but nearer to the bank, was re&s;erved for the encamp|ment of the &s;econd, which was not expected to ar|rive till after &s;ome time. In a fortnight or three weeks, the intermitting fever began to &s;hew it&s;elf. It &s;pread &s;o rapidly, particularly in the &s;econd bat|talion, that before the end of July, when the po&s;t was abandoned, few were left who had not felt its influence. The prevailing &s;ymptoms of this di&s;ea&s;e were much &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the fever of Ebenezer. The type was frequently double tertian, or quoti|dian; the remi&s;&s;ions were indi&s;tinct; the bilious vo|mitings and purgings were often exce&s;&s;ive, and marks of malignity appeared in &s;everal in&s;tances. The approach of the enemy made it nece&s;&s;ary that the po&s;t &s;hould be withdrawn; but there was much
<PB N="196" REF="028890_0205_0FDE5E1553150280">
difficulty in accompli&s;hing it. Two thirds of both officers and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> were unable to march; and it was not po&s;&s;ible, in the &s;ituation in which we were placed, to find waggons &s;ufficient to carry them, together with the nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ions and baggage; &s;o that no other re&s;ource was left, than to convey &s;ome part of them to George Town by water. Boats were therefore collected for this purpo&s;e, and &s;uch men were put into them, as were judged lea&s;t likely to be &s;oon fit for the &s;ervice of the field. The&s;e, however, unfortunately fell into the hands of the militia, in their pa&s;&s;age down the river, and were &s;oon di&s;per&s;ed into the different parts of the country; &s;o that I can|not &s;peak with certainty of the general i&s;&s;ue of the di&s;ea&s;e. Tho&s;e who retired to Camden by land, im|proved unexpectedly in the &s;tate of their health, in the cour&s;e of the march. During the time that we lay at the Cheraws, the remi&s;&s;ions were generally ob&s;cure; but after the &s;econd or third day's march, the type changed frequently from double to &s;ingle ter|tian; at the &s;ame time that intermi&s;&s;ions became clear and di&s;tinct. It may be difficult to determine pre|ci&s;ely to what cau&s;e this might be owing; whether to removal from a &s;ituation, where the fomes of the di&s;ea&s;e was in a very concentrated &s;tate; to the mere exerci&s;e of travelling; or to the effects of cooler <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eather with rain, which happened at this time, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ich continued for two or three days with little in|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">mi&s;&s;ion. The whole of tho&s;e cau&s;es, perhaps, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ntributed to operate this &s;alutary change; though <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> will probably be reckoned among the fir&s;t in&s;tances, where travelling and getting wet, are recommended as being u&s;eful in the cure of fevers. During the month of Augu&s;t, and a great part of September, the army remained encamped near Camden. The weather was exce&s;&s;ively hot, and fevers were fre|quent,&mdash;&s;ometimes malignant and dangerous; though they pre&s;erved, in general, the di&s;tinct character of
<PB N="197" REF="028890_0206_0FDE5EED8DB3A8F0">
intermittents. In the months of October and No|vember relap&s;es were numerous, and original attacks, though rare, were dangerous and alarming when they happened. Some in&s;tances of a di&s;ea&s;e were now ob&s;erved of a more &s;erious nature than any that had hitherto appeared. In&s;tead of di&s;tinct intermi&s;&s;ions, which prevailed during the preceding months, the &s;malle&s;t traces of remi&s;&s;ion were &s;carcely perceptible; the countenance was du&s;ky, and of a grea&s;y appear|ance, the tongue was con&s;tantly dry and parched; the head was often much affected, and grangrenous &s;pots &s;ometimes appeared on the extremities. The duration of this di&s;ea&s;e often did not exceed &s;even days; &s;ometimes it continued a fortnight, or even longer. It was generally of a fatal nature; and where it happened to people who had been &s;ubject to the intermitting fever in the preceding months, it for the mo&s;t part effected &s;uch a change on the con&s;titution, as de&s;troyed the tendency to relap&s;e. But be&s;ides this unu&s;ual &s;pecies of di&s;ea&s;e, which &s;ometimes appeared in the months of October and November, it was likewi&s;e ob&s;erved that relap&s;es of the fever, which pre&s;erved the di&s;tinct intermitting character, were not only le&s;s frequent, but commonly le&s;s alarming, in proportion as the weather turned cooler. Relap&s;es were often remarked in this &s;ea|&s;on to terminate of their own accord, in a very &s;hort time; and frequently to leave the body in a &s;tate of greater vigour than they found it. I find a fact in my notes, with regard to this &s;ubject, which is curious and important. Between thirty and forty of the men of the regiment entered upon the &s;ervice of the campaign in &s;o weak a &s;tate, that they were unable at fir&s;t to carry their arms. They however gained &s;trength &s;peedily as they proceeded on the march; and &s;eldom forgot to mention, that they felt a new acce&s;&s;ion of vigour after every accidental relap&s;e. But I mu&s;t further ob&s;erve, that, together with the
<PB N="198" REF="028890_0207_0FDE5E1BEE242DF8">
above changes which happened in the progre&s;s of the &s;ea&s;on, the epidemic &s;hewed a remarkable tendency to degenerate into dy&s;entery or drop&s;y in the months of September and October. The gripings in this &s;pecies of dy&s;entery were often &s;evere; the &s;tools were large and watery; and times of aggravation and remi&s;&s;ion were frequently ob&s;erved, as in a regular intermittent. Indeed the intermittent, the dy&s;entery, and even the drop&s;ical &s;wellings &s;o often alternated with one another, as evidently &s;hewed that they all depended upon the &s;ame general cau&s;e. The cam|paign of the following winter was a very active one. The army travelled over a great extent of country, and was con&s;idered by many as performing very hard &s;ervice; but I have the &s;atisfaction to add, that notwith&s;tanding occa&s;ional forced marches, wading of rivers, expo&s;ure to rain, accidental &s;carcity of bread, and no great profu&s;ion of beef, with the total want of rum, the troops enjoyed in general a mo&s;t perfect &s;tate of health. Valetudinarians were re&s;tored to perfect vigour; and when we arrived at Wilmington, in the latter end of April, there &s;carcely was a man in the regiment to which I belonged, who was not fit for the duty of the field. In the &s;ummer cam|paign through North Carolina and Virginia, there was no room to complain of hard&s;hips. The camp abounded with a profu&s;ion of the be&s;t provi&s;ions; and the marches were &s;eldom long or fatiguing. We arrived at Port&s;mouth towards the end of July, with a very moderate li&s;t of &s;ick. Port&s;mouth is &s;aid to be unhealthy; and we &s;oon were able to verify the ob&s;ervation: an intermitting fever, complicated, or alternating with a dy&s;enteric complaint, made its appearance &s;oon after our arrival, and continued to increa&s;e during the &s;hort time we remained in the place. A di&s;ea&s;e of a &s;imilar kind continued to pre|vail in the army, after our removal to York Town. It was not, however, by any means fatal in its nature,
<PB N="199" REF="028890_0208_0FDE5EFCA5772BD8">
or difficult of cure, if attended to in time, though if allowed to go on, it often degenerated into drop&s;y, ob&s;tructions in the abdominal vi&s;cera, or a dy&s;enteric complaint which frequently proved fatal in the begin|ning of the following winter. The 71&s;t regiment had now &s;erved three campaigns in the &s;outhern pro|vinces, and might be con&s;idered as being perfectly well &s;ea&s;oned to the climate. It was in fact more healthy than any other corps in the army; there not being more than five or &s;ix unfit for the duty of the line, when the French and Americans inve&s;ted the place. After the capitulation the proportion of the &s;ick of the army increa&s;ed con&s;iderably. Some in|&s;tances of a fever, &s;imilar to that which prevailed at Camden and Savanna, in the month of November, were ob&s;erved in &s;everal regiments; but a &s;pecies of dy&s;entery, which appeared often to have originated from an ill cured intermittent, was the complaint which proved principally fatal.</P>
<P>From the above &s;hort hi&s;tory of the intermitting fever, as it appeared in the 71&s;t regiment, in the dif|ferent provinces of North America, where that corps happened to &s;erve, we may be enabled to form &s;ome idea of the changes, which are more con&s;tantly pro|duced by &s;ea&s;on and climate, or which ari&s;e accident|ally from the particular effects of local &s;ituation. In the &s;pring and beginning of &s;ummer, the &s;ingle ter|tian was the mo&s;t u&s;ual type of the endemic of Ame|rica, in every province which the regiment vi&s;ited:&mdash;the paroxy&s;ms were di&s;tinct, and the intermi&s;&s;ions were generally perfect. In the months of June, July and Augu&s;t, double tertians were common, and in &s;ome &s;ituations bani&s;hed every &s;impler form. As the weather turned cool, the &s;ingle tertian re&s;umed its place; &s;o that any other type was &s;carcely ever &s;een. But be&s;ides the above changes of type, which in &s;ome degree followed the changes of &s;ea&s;on, dy&s;entery or drop&s;y frequently made their appearance in the months
<PB N="200" REF="028890_0209_0FDE5E2207E6F300">
of Augu&s;t, September and October, alternating with, or &s;ucceeding the intermittent; while fevers of a bad and uncommon kind were by no means rare in the months of October and November.</P>
<P>I have thus ob&s;erved <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a cur&s;ory manner the more general changes of the intermitting fever, as influ|enced by change of &s;ea&s;on. I may al&s;o remark, that be&s;ides &s;ea&s;on, climate had a con&s;iderable effect in modifying the appearances of the di&s;ea&s;e. It thus happened, that the type was generally &s;ingle tertian on York I&s;land, even in the heat of &s;ummer; in &s;pring and winter other forms were rarely &s;een. In Georgia, the &s;ingle tertian was the prevailing form, only in the winter and &s;pring. In &s;ummer, and &s;ome part of autumn, double tertians were common; and types of &s;till greater complication frequently made their appearance during this period, in &s;ome particular &s;ituations of the province. Dy&s;entery drop&s;y and dan|gerous fevers were likewi&s;e more frequent here in the autumnal months, than they were found to be in the neighbourhood of New York; while the cour&s;e of intermittent, as long as the form was regular, was more &s;peedily checked by Peruvian Bark in Georgia, than in the more northern latitudes. The prevailing type of the climate of South Carolina, was &s;ingle ter|tian, even in the &s;ummer and autumn; yet where the forms of the di&s;ea&s;e was in a high &s;tate of concentra|tion, as at the Cheraws, the type was of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> com|plicated that remi&s;&s;ions were &s;carcely di&s;cernible. The tendency of the endemic of this province, to degene|rate into dy&s;entery or drop&s;y in the antumn, was like|wi&s;e le&s;s remarkable than in Georgia. The danger|ous fevers of October and November were al&s;o fewer in number; though &s;till more frequent, and more for|midable than in the province of New York. The province of Virginia lies about halfway between New York and Savanna; and the general effects of its cli|mate, on the common endemic of the country, cor|re&s;ponded
<PB N="201" REF="028890_0210_0FDE5F061F98DE00">
with its local &s;ituation.&mdash;Deviations from the tertian type were more frequent than at the one place, le&s;s &s;o than at the other.</P>
<P>It appears from what has been &s;aid above, that the &s;ingle tertian is the proper fundamental type of North America. It undergoes, as we have &s;een, a regular change and alteration, in con&s;equence of the ordinary changes of the &s;ea&s;ons, as al&s;o in con&s;equence of the effects of the various climates of the different pro|vinces of that exten&s;ive continent: but be&s;ides the&s;e changes, which are more general and certain, we like|wi&s;e find, that the accidental circum&s;tances of local &s;ituation often produce very remarkable effects. In this manner, though the type of the fever which pre|vailed on York I&s;land, was properly &s;ingle tertian; yet double tertians, and even more complicated forms, were not by any means rare, in a part of the batta|lion which lay contiguous to a &s;wamp. The real nature of the endemic fever of Georgia, is, perhaps, properly of the intermitting kind; yet remi&s;&s;ions were often &s;carcely perceptible at Ebenezer; which is &s;itu|ated immediately on the bank of the river Savanna, and which, in &s;ome degree, is &s;urrounded by creeks of fre&s;h water. It may not be improper to remark with regard to Ebenezer, that few places in America have been ob&s;erved to be more unhealthful; though &s;uch a conclu&s;ion probably would not be drawn from a general view of its &s;ituation. It occupies a &s;andy eminence of con&s;iderable elevation, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a con&s;iderable environ of cleared ground. At Sa|vanna, which is &s;ituated twenty-five miles nearer the mouth of the river, there were likewi&s;e many in|&s;tances of deviation from the &s;ingle tertian type, but &s;till fewer than at Ebenezer. The fever likewi&s;e was generally of a le&s;s dangerous kind. The obvi|ous appearances of the two places did not afford &s;uf|ficient rea&s;on for forming this conclu&s;ion. The &s;itu|ation of Savanna would have probably been thought
<PB N="202" REF="028890_0211_0FDE5E2A1D96AD30">
to be the lea&s;t favourable to health. Though elevated and dry, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a wider environ of cleared ground than Ebenezer; yet a &s;wamp on the right and left, with a river and rice &s;wamps in front, threat|ened great ravage from intermittents. That they were le&s;s formidable than might have been expected, was probably in a greater mea&s;ure owing to the bluff or &s;and bank being higher than the &s;ituation of the town, and intercepting, in &s;ome degree, the exhala|tions from the river and great &s;wamps.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erved on a former occa&s;ion, that the &s;igns of cri&s;is, in the remitting fever of Jamaica, were generally clear and unequivocal. I mu&s;t now own, that I have not been able to attain certainty, on this head, in the intermitting fever of America. In fe|vers of a &s;ingle tertian type, the intermi&s;&s;ions were frequently &s;o perfect and complete, that it was not ea&s;y to &s;ay what was wanting to con&s;titute perfect health: even in the hot months of &s;ummer, where the remi&s;&s;ions were extremely ob&s;cure, I often found it difficult to form an opinion to which I could confi|dently tru&s;t; as it happened frequently, that tho&s;e &s;igns, which I had been di&s;po&s;ed to con&s;ider at one time as marks of final cri&s;is, proved in the event only to be indications of more di&s;tinct intermi&s;&s;ion, or of &s;ome change in the nature of the &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>Having given a &s;hort view of the hi&s;tory and pro|gre&s;s of the intermitting fever of America in the pre|ceding pages, I &s;hall now proceed to offer a few ob|&s;ervations on the manner of treatment. And I may ob&s;erve in the fir&s;t place, that the intermitting fever is not in general a di&s;ea&s;e of a dangerous nature. If treated with deci&s;ion in the beginning, it is for the mo&s;t part removed very &s;peedily and very certainly; though if attacked with feeble remedies, it often con|tinu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and not &s;eldom lays the foundation of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> have an unfavourable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. The intermitting fever &s;ometimes proves
<PB N="203" REF="028890_0212_0FDE5F0703760450">
fatal from the actual violence of the &s;ymptoms of the paroxy&s;m, though the danger more generally ari&s;es from a tendency to degenerate into dy&s;entery or drop|&s;y, or to form vi&s;ceral ob&s;tructions. But be&s;ides the danger, which ari&s;es from the actual force, or from the more tedious effects of the di&s;ea&s;e, we often find a character of peculiar malignity, in the intermittents of &s;ome &s;ea&s;ons and &s;ome &s;ituations, which de&s;erves to be particularly attended to. Malignity is a word of a vague meaning; and on different occa&s;ions is dif|ferently applied. In the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, I refer the term to a peculiar character of the di&s;ea&s;e, expre&s;&s;ed by a certain &s;tate of the eye and countenance of the the patient. It was &s;ometimes ob&s;erved, that the countenance of the patient was flu&s;hed; but at the &s;ame time dark and overca&s;t; or that it was of a grea&s;y and du&s;ky appearance, with a look of &s;ternne&s;s and de&s;pondence in the eye. Tho&s;e appearances, particu|larly where a white glutinous covering appeared on the tongue, were con&s;tantly indications of concealed or lurking danger. They occurred often at Ebene|zer and the Cheraws, and I had the misfortune to learn from experience, that whenever they occurred, time ought not to be &s;pent in the frivolous prepara|tions, which are u&s;ually thought nece&s;&s;ary to precede the giving of bark. If we judge it not to be proper in any ca&s;e to venture upon the u&s;e of bark, before the body has been &s;ufficiently prepared by emetics and cathartics, we &s;hall too often meet with in&s;tances where the cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e will be fini&s;hed be|fore the&s;e preparations are completed. It has hap|pened oftener than once to my&s;elf, that the fatal pa|roxy&s;m commenced before I had gone through the u&s;ual routine of preparation, which at that time I thought indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary, before I attempted to cut &s;hort the cour&s;e of the fever by means of its well known &s;pecific.</P>
<P>Having premi&s;ed &s;o much with regard to the ge|neral
<PB N="204" REF="028890_0213_0FDE5E31485F3BF8">
nature of the di&s;ea&s;e, I &s;hall now add a few ob&s;er|vations about the management of tho&s;e remedies which have been mo&s;t u&s;ually employed; &s;ome of which appear to be &s;uperfluous; while there is only one of them which has a right to be con&s;idered as ef|fectual. It is a common and obvious remark, that the intermitting fevers of the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on &s;hew a ge|neral tendency to run over a &s;imilar cour&s;e, though the modes of treatment may be &s;ometimes directly oppo&s;ite. As I had often taken notice of this fact during the time that I remained in America, I began to &s;u&s;pect that the changes, which I had been accu&s;|tomed to attribute to treatment, were in reality owing to a di&s;po&s;ition in the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e, which was little affected by the ordinary pre&s;criptions. But that I might in &s;ome degree a&s;certain the truth of this &s;u&s;picion, I &s;elected thirty ca&s;es of fever, which had commenced within twenty-four hours of each other. This experiment was made at Ebenezer, in the month of May; where the di&s;ea&s;e, though highly epidemic, had not yet di&s;covered any &s;igns of malignity; &s;o that danger was not apprehended from a delay of a few days. I cla&s;&s;ed tho&s;e thirty ca&s;es in three divi&s;ions, without paying regard to the nature of the &s;ymptoms of any individual ca&s;e. To one I pre&s;cribed a repe|tition of emetics, at &s;uch intervals as were judged proper; for another, cathartics of various kinds, or managed in various manners; while I left the third wholly to its own cour&s;e. I watched the progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e attentively for the &s;pace of eight days, and cannot pretend to &s;ay, that I ob&s;erved any material difference in the changes or appearance of tho&s;e ca&s;es, which were treated in &s;o different a manner. The type, which was generally &s;ingle tertian at the com|mencement of the di&s;order, changed for the mo&s;t part to double tertian or quotidian, after the &s;econd or third paroxy&s;m; though not in a different proportion, as far as I could judge, in tho&s;e which were left
<PB N="205" REF="028890_0214_0FDE5F13F555B790">
entirely to Nature, or which were created in the man|ner which has been mentioned above. It de&s;erves however to be remarked, that the paroxy&s;ms were u&s;ually milder, more regular and di&s;tinct after the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> u&s;e of carthartics; as al&s;o that bark &s;ucceeded more &s;peedily and more certainly after a repetition of antimonial emetics.</P>
<P>Where bleeding is judged to be proper or nece&s;|&s;ary in the cure of the intermitting fever, the circum|&s;tances are generally &s;uch as require that it precede every other in order of time. Bleeding was often found to be u&s;eful in particular ca&s;es. It moderated the violence of &s;ymptoms, and &s;eemed not to be with|out effect in removing a certain &s;tate of the &s;y&s;tem, which re&s;i&s;ted the &s;ucce&s;sful operation of the bark; but I mu&s;t likewi&s;e add, that there was &s;eldom occa|&s;ion to employ it in the &s;outhern provinces of Ame|rica. It was blamed by &s;ome as increa&s;ing the di&s;|po&s;ition to relap&s;e: of this, however, I can &s;ay nothing from my own experience; and as I am di&s;po&s;ed to be|lieve, that the lo&s;s of a moderate quantity of blood, &s;eldom does material harm in this di&s;ea&s;e; &s;o I have rea&s;on to think, that it is &s;eldom nece&s;&s;ary in warm climates, particularly in the hot months of &s;ummer or autumn.</P>
<P>Emetics have been employed in the cure of inter|mittents for a long time pa&s;t. There are many prac|titioners, who con&s;ider there u&s;e as indi&s;pen&s;able; and &s;ome have pretended, that the cure of the di&s;ea&s;e, in its earlier &s;tages, may be tru&s;ted to this remedy alone. Emetic tartar, &s;o managed as to operate at the hour of the fever's return, was &s;ometimes found to prevent the acce&s;s of a particular paroxy&s;m; but though obliged, from want of bark, to have recour&s;e to this method of treatment in numberle&s;s in&s;tances; my experience does not &s;upply me with a &s;ingle one, where I could po&s;itively <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, that it ab&s;olutely cut &s;hort the cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e. Relap&s;es, I mu&s;t

confe&s;s, di&s;appeared frequently in con&s;equence of the practice; but they likewi&s;e di&s;appeared frequently, where nothing at all was done: &s;o that I cannot help being of opinion, either that the real effects of emetics have been mi&s;taken, or that the proper modes of managing them are not generally known. I mu&s;t not however omit to mention, that emetics are occa|&s;ionally of great &s;ervice, and that antimonial emetics e&s;pecially obviate the effects of inflammatory dia|the&s;is, and on particular occa&s;ions facilitate the &s;uc|ce&s;sful operation of the bark. They are likewi&s;e &s;eldom followed by tho&s;e dangerous effects which frequently ari&s;e from the employment of them in fevers of Jamaica; though I certainly &s;hould advi&s;e that they be u&s;ed with great caution in the &s;outhern provinces, in the &s;ummer and autumn, where the re|mi&s;&s;ions of the fever are ob&s;cure.</P>
<P>Cathartics have likewi&s;e been much employed by practitioners in the cure of intermitting fevers; and in few ca&s;es, perhaps, can be omitted with &s;afety. They certainly po&s;&s;e&s;s very remarkable effects in rendering the form of the di&s;ea&s;e regular and di&s;tinct; but they do not &s;eem to be endued with a particular power of cutting &s;hort its cour&s;e.&mdash;The circum|&s;tances of the ca&s;e can only point out the propriety or advantage of the various remedies of this cla&s;s.</P>
<P>The above are the u&s;ual modes of evacuation, which mo&s;t practitioners con&s;ider to be indi&s;putably nece&s;&s;ary previous to the exhibition of bark. I mu&s;t however remark, that ca&s;es &s;ometimes occurred in the &s;outhern provinces, particularly in the hot months of &s;ummer, which only admitted of tho&s;e evacuations in a &s;mall degree. In&s;tead of the di&s;tinct and regular paroxy&s;ms, which were expected to follow the u&s;e of emetics or cathartics, the di&s;ea&s;e was &s;ometimes ob&s;erved to a&s;&s;ume a languid and continued form, in con&s;equence of &s;uch treatment, while it likewi&s;e in &s;ome in&s;tances recovered the di&s;tinction of paroxy&s;m

and remi&s;&s;ion, by means of applications, which excited the tone and vigour of the &s;y&s;tem; particularly by means of exerci&s;e in cooler air, or accidentally by ex|po&s;ure to rain.</P>
<P>Peruvian Bark is the chief remedy, upon which we now depend, for the cure of intermitting fevers. It is a remedy, which like others, has undergone &s;ome rever&s;es of reputation, &s;ince its fir&s;t introduction into Europe; and, though its efficacy is now fully acknowledged, perhaps over-rated by Engli&s;h practi|tioners, it does not &s;eem yet to have gained the &s;ame general credit with other European nations. The French u&s;e it with caution, and many of the Germans are &s;till its enemies. It has been accu&s;ed even by &s;ome of the Engli&s;h writers, of failing in the cure of intermittents; and blamed by many of occa&s;ioning complaints more dangerous in their nature than tho&s;e it was intended to remove. I was early aware of the&s;e objections, and watched narrowly that I might di&s;cover its real effects; and am warranted in &s;aying, that it has every right to be con&s;idered as a &s;pecific in ague and fever; while it is totally free from the im|putation of occa&s;ioning dy&s;entery, drop&s;y, or vi&s;ceral ob&s;truction. Tho&s;e complaints were always mo&s;t frequent, where this remedy had been the mo&s;t &s;par|ingly employed.</P>
<P>But though I have mentioned that bark is both a &s;afe and efficacious remedy in the cure of intermit|ting fevers, I mu&s;t al&s;o confe&s;s, that it is only ren|dered &s;o by particular modes of management. It is probable that much of the bark, which is now im|ported into England, is either in &s;ome &s;hape adulte|rated, or naturally inferior in quality to what it had been in former times; as we often read of cures ef|fected by a &s;ingle drachm in the la&s;t century, which we &s;hould &s;carcely now expect from an ounce. Three or four ounces &s;eldom failed of checking the progre&s;s of the mo&s;t formidable fevers of America; one or
<PB N="208" REF="028890_0217_0FDE5E5BD8096D58">
two frequently did not produce any &s;en&s;ible effect. Being perfectly convinced of the truth of this ob&s;er|vation, I generally gave bark in ca&s;es, where the circum&s;tances were judged proper for its exhibition, in do&s;es of two drachms; which I directed to be re|peated every two hours during the ab&s;ence of the fever. By this mode of treatment the di&s;ea&s;e was often &s;o completely conquered, that the patient was frequently capable of returning to his duty in the &s;pace of &s;even or eight days. Time ought not to be &s;pent in frivolous preparations, or di&s;ea&s;es attacked with feeble remedies, where the health of &s;oldiers is concerned. The &s;peedie&s;t cures are generally the be&s;t; and I have had many opportunities of wit|ne&s;&s;ing more health and &s;trength gained during eight days in the field, than I &s;hould have expected from a month's ea&s;e in an ho&s;pital, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the be&s;t advice of the phy&s;icians. The above-mentioned quantity of bark, for the mo&s;t part, was &s;ufficient to effect a cure in ordinary ca&s;es of the di&s;ea&s;e; but where danger appeared to be threatening, the do&s;es were often increa&s;ed to half an ounce, or even more. In &s;ome ca&s;es of ob&s;tinacy, indeed, accompanied with a &s;luggi&s;hne&s;s of con&s;titution, I ob&s;erved no other rule in the quantity than &s;uch as proved di&s;agreeable to the &s;tomach, or excited a tumul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> in the &s;y&s;tem. The method was often &s;ucce&s;sful; and I may ob&s;erve in general, that two ounces taken at five or &s;ix times, and in the &s;pace of eight or ten hours, were often more effectual, than double the quantity in &s;mall do&s;es, and at long intervals. If the large do&s;es of bark, which I have recommended, &s;hould appear to any one to be dangerous or unnece&s;&s;ary; I may add, that I have my&s;elf frequently taken an ounce at once; while I have likewi&s;e ob&s;erved the cure to be tedious and uncertain with the moderate do&s;es of ordinary practice. I may farther remark, that this remedy was often rejected by the &s;tomach, and in &s;ome ca&s;es
<PB N="209" REF="028890_0218_0FDE5F276E1516B0">
pa&s;&s;ed off almo&s;t in&s;tantly by &s;tool; yet that the cour&s;e of the fever &s;eemed to be no le&s;s effectually checked by it, than when &s;uch effects did not occur.</P>
<P>The quantity of bark, which I frequently pre|&s;cribed in the intermitting fever of America, may appear to be greater than nece&s;&s;ary: &s;o the time at which it was &s;ometimes given, may al&s;o appear to be premature. Bark was &s;eldom given in the fevers of the &s;pring and beginning of &s;ummer, unle&s;s in ca&s;es of relap&s;e, till after &s;ufficient evacuations had been premi&s;ed. In the autumnal months, where &s;igns of malignity and danger were di&s;covered, the fir&s;t inter|mi&s;&s;ion was often laid hold of&punc; neither was it uni|formly deemed nece&s;&s;ary, to premi&s;e the evacuations of vomiting or purging. In relap&s;es I &s;eldom let pa&s;s the opportunity which the fir&s;t intermi&s;&s;ion af|forded; by which means, tho&s;e who were &s;ubject to the returns of this di&s;ea&s;e, were rarely returned in the reports of the &s;ick.</P>
<P>Where bark was given in &s;uch quantity, and in &s;uch manner as I have mentioned above, it generally was &s;ucce&s;sful in checking the progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e; yet I mu&s;t not omit to ob&s;erve, that in&s;tances &s;ome|times occurred, where it totally failed of this effect, under every mode of management that could be de|vi&s;ed. It would be u&s;eful to a&s;certain tho&s;e circum|&s;tances exactly; but this is a ta&s;k which I cannot promi&s;e to perform. It was however remarked, that where the inflammatory diathe&s;is prevailed in very evident degree, bark was frequently given without &s;ucce&s;s: and owing to this cau&s;e, perhaps, it was le&s;s to be tru&s;ted to in the &s;pring, (unle&s;s in ca&s;es of relap&s;e), than in the hot weather of &s;ummer and au|tumn. But be&s;ides the obvious marks of inflamma|tory diathe&s;is, there appeared to be other conditions of the frame unfriendly to the &s;ucce&s;sful operations of bark. The exact nature of the&s;e, indeed, was perceived with difficulty; yet I have often ob&s;erved
<PB N="210" REF="028890_0219_0FDE5E64E518FA90">
them to be connected with &s;ome of the following cir|cum&s;tances; <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> with a &s;mall and hard pul&s;e, or with a pul&s;e where the &s;troke was ob&s;cure or without ex|pan&s;ion, and where a creeping or vermicular motion was ob&s;erved in the &s;tate of the artery; to which was &s;ometimes added, a con&s;tricted &s;tate of the &s;kin, a clammy moi&s;ture on the &s;urface of the body, with|out &s;igns of free per&s;piration, and together with a &s;u&s;|pen&s;ion or irregular action of the nervous influence. In the &s;tate de&s;cribed above, bark alone was often given in great quantity, without producing any &s;en|ble effect. It &s;ometimes &s;ucceeded where antimo|nials, opiates and other anti&s;pa&s;modics were joined with it; but bli&s;ters applied to the back part of the head and neck, were &s;erviceable above all other re|medies in removing tho&s;e circum&s;tances, whatever they were, which &s;tood in the way of its &s;ucce&s;sful operation. In &s;ome ca&s;es which had proved ob&s;tinate to every other means, the di&s;ea&s;e di&s;appeared imme|diately after their application; and in every one where they were employed, cea&s;ed any longer to re|&s;i&s;t the bark. Bark alone undoubtedly has a right to be con&s;idered as a &s;pecific in the cure of the in|termitting fever, but its virtues are occa&s;ionally im|proved by the addition of aromatics, chalybeates, and particularly by a certain proportion of &s;nake root. It was a practice with &s;ome of the country people of Carolina, to attempt the cure of the intermitting fever by means of Virginia &s;nake root, given in do&s;es of two &s;cruples or half a drachm. I made a trial of that remedy in &s;everal in&s;tances; but did not find that it was &s;ucce&s;sful. Joined however with the Peruvian bark, in the proportion of two drachms to an ounce, it was often ob&s;erved to produce very ex|cellent effects. The cures were more complete and more permanent. There was not only le&s;s tendency to relap&s;e, but dy&s;enteries and drop&s;ies were more rare, after I was fortunate enough to adopt this mode
<PB N="211" REF="028890_0220_0FDE5F2E48F76130">
of practice, than they had been during the preceding years.</P>
<P>There have been many different conjectures about the mode of the bark's operation in the cure of in|termitting fevers; but none of them afford a &s;atisfac|tory explanation of the &s;ubject. Bark is evidently bitter, a&s;tringent and aromatic; but how it becomes &s;pecific in intermittents, in a degree &s;o &s;uperior to all other bitters, a&s;tringents and aromatics, is a my&s;|tery we cannot ea&s;ily comprehend. It obviou&s;ly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a power of giving tone and vigour to the powers of life; and often communicates to the &s;an|guiferous &s;y&s;tem, a certain &s;tate or di&s;po&s;ition, known by the name of inflammatory diathe&s;is. Thus it is u&s;ually ob&s;erved, that where the nervous frame is weak and delicate, bark rarely failed of cutting &s;hort the cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, and its &s;ucce&s;s in &s;uch ca&s;es, is preceded, for the mo&s;t part, by apparent changes in the general diathe&s;is of the &s;y&s;tem. If &s;trength, fulne&s;s, and vigour of pul&s;e follow the em|ployment of bark, the fever frequently di&s;appears; but if tho&s;e &s;igns are wanting, it is not po&s;&s;ible to form any certain judgment of the future effect. In like manner, if &s;igns of inflammatory diathe&s;is con|tinue to prevail during the cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, bark &s;ometimes changes it to a continued fever; but &s;el|dom checks its progre&s;s effectually. From the&s;e facts, which I have often &s;een verified, I am di&s;po&s;ed to conclude, that bark is only to be con&s;idered as an accidental &s;pecific in the cure of intermittents, and that its &s;alutary effects probably may be explained from the change, which it occa&s;ions in the relative &s;tate of the body. That bark is &s;o often &s;ucce&s;sful depends, we may pre&s;ume, on the intermitting fever being &s;o often connected with an attonic &s;tate of the &s;y&s;tem; from which cau&s;e it probably ari&s;es, that it is &s;o much more effectual in &s;ummer and autumn, in warm weather and in warm climates, than in the
<PB N="212" REF="028890_0221_0FDE5E6E12ACCEB8">
oppo&s;ite circum&s;tances. But though an attonic &s;tate of the &s;y&s;tem is frequently connected with intermit|ting fever, it is not con&s;tantly &s;o; hence the di&s;ea&s;e is not invariably removed by tho&s;e proce&s;&s;es which excite tone, or give ri&s;e to the inflammatory diathe&s;is. Exce&s;&s;ive evacuations and other cau&s;es, by which the body has been reduced to the la&s;t &s;tate of debility, have often interrupted the cour&s;e of an intermittent. So that we have every rea&s;on to conclude, that bark is only relatively &s;pecific, in as much as it de&s;troys certain circum&s;tances of aptitude, whch are e&s;&s;entially connected in particular &s;ituations with the exi&s;tence of the di&s;ea&s;e. In this manner, voyages, journeys, new pur&s;uits, or new modes of life, frights, the active &s;ervice of the field, or the hard&s;hips of &s;ieges have often removed intermitting fever, which had re&s;i&s;ted the ordinary aids of medicine.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erved in a former part of this treati&s;e, that it was &s;eldom a matter of much difficulty to &s;top the cour&s;e of the intermitting fever of America; but I mu&s;t now add, that it was always difficult, &s;ometimes impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ecure the patient again&s;t any future return of the di&s;ea&s;e. Bark, though much celebrated for this purpo&s;e, did not &s;eem to prevent a relap&s;e with the &s;ame certainty with which it &s;topped the cour&s;e of the fever, when actually pre&s;ent. It de&s;erves however to be remarked, that where bark had been given at regular intervals after the di&s;ea&s;e di&s;appeared, the paroxy&s;ms in the relap&s;e were, in general, not only &s;lighter, but had u&s;ually more of the inflamma|tory diathe&s;is joined with them, while the complaint &s;hewed more di&s;po&s;ition to terminate of its own accord, after a few revolutions. It is univer&s;ally known, that the powers of bark &s;eldom fail in the cure of inter|mitting fevers, where given in &s;ufficient quantity; yet I mu&s;t al&s;o ob&s;erve, that its virtues do not &s;eem to extend farther than to a temporary &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the paroxy&s;ms. That bark does not elimenate or
<PB N="213" REF="028890_0222_0FDE5F33F85A3D30">
de&s;troy the actual cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, appears plainly from this fact, that relap&s;es are frequently the con&s;e|quence of tho&s;e circum&s;tances, which occa&s;ion debi|lity, or which counteract the effects of this tonic remedy. To which we may add, that though relap&s;es are often of a different type from the original fever, yet, as they generally happen on an even day from the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the paroxy&s;m, there can be little room to doubt that the old complaint again re&s;umes its cour&s;e, though it probably, in the mean time, lo&s;es &s;everal of its original &s;ymptoms. It is a fact likewi&s;e which we ought not to omit mentioning, but which in general, does not &s;eem to be much attended to, that &s;ome periods are more remarkable for the re|lap&s;e of intermitting fevers than others. I ob&s;erved before, that relap&s;es almo&s;t con&s;tantly happen on the even days. I now add, that the mo&s;t remarkable of tho&s;e days are the &s;ixth, the eighth, twelfth, four|teenth, twentieth, twenty-&s;econd, twenty-eighth, and thirtieth. The fourteenth is remarkable for re|lap&s;es above all the others. Next to it we may rank the twelfth, twentieth, and twenty-&s;econd; unle&s;s in times of very prevailing &s;ickne&s;s, where the &s;ixth and eighth often come in for a great &s;hare. If we take pains to examine the particular circum&s;tances of the patient, and attend to the nature and degree of the prevailing epidemic, we may often be enabled to form a tolerable conjecture with regard to the mo&s;t pro|bable period of return. Having therefore acquired from ob&s;ervation &s;ome general ideas of the different propen&s;ities to relap&s;e in different &s;ituations, and in different &s;ubjects, I u&s;ually began to give the bark in quantity, and to u&s;e other precautions on the fifth, after the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the paroxy&s;m, in ca&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> where there were the &s;tronge&s;t &s;u&s;picions of a &s;peedy return; while this was delayed till the eleventh, nineteenth, or twenty-&s;eventh in others, in proportion to the different degrees of healthine&s;s. This practice was
<PB N="214" REF="028890_0223_0FDE5E74A8614F90">
continued for the &s;pace of three days, or till the &s;u&s;|picious period was pa&s;t. But I mu&s;t further remark, that be&s;ides the propen&s;ity, which was ob&s;erved in fevers to return at the periods above-mentioned, the approach to the new and full moon was likewi&s;e found to be connected with relap&s;es in a very remarkable manner. Independent therefore, of the precautions, which were u&s;ed at the &s;eptenary periods, the ap|proach to new and full moon was con&s;tantly at|tended to.</P>
<P>If the above directions were carefully complied with, we might in general prevent the di&s;ea&s;e from proving fatal, or from injuring the con&s;titution ma|terially, though I mu&s;t at the &s;ame time confe&s;s, that we could in reality do little more than pre&s;erve the patient in a valetudinary &s;tate, till cool weather, a change of &s;ituation, or &s;uch a change in the manner of life as excited the active powers of the con&s;titu|tion, contributed their part to effect a permanent e&s;tabli&s;hment of health. Being perfectly convinced of the truth of this ob&s;ervation, I generally remitted the men to the regiment, to be put upon the li&s;t of duty, as &s;oon as I was certain that the cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e was actually &s;topt. The practice at fir&s;t &s;ight may appear har&s;h; but I have found it to be &s;alutary. Exerci&s;e, even &s;ome degree of exertion, promotes the recovery of health. Habits of &s;loth and indo|lence are &s;peedily contracted in ho&s;pitals: the military ardour is gradually extingui&s;hed, and bodily &s;trength is recruited more &s;lowly than in the field, under every di&s;advantage of fatigue or inclement weather.&mdash;Of the truth of this I have had ample experience.</P>
<P>I have now pretty fully de&s;cribed the method of cure, which I pur&s;ued in the intermitting fever of America. I am not ignorant that other plans have been adopted, and other remedies employed by others; but as I have not had experience of any, except that which I have mentioned, I do not reckon my&s;elf
<PB N="215" REF="028890_0224_0FDE5F3B02B3AA68">
qualified to furni&s;h any remarks on the &s;ubject. Bark, indeed, is &s;o &s;afe, and at the &s;ame time &s;o effectual, that I &s;hould be &s;low in recommending any other re|medy, where this can be procured in &s;ufficient quan|tity. The &s;tronge&s;t proofs of its value ari&s;e from a comparative view of the mortality of the intermit|ting fever, in different regiments, which were em|ployed on the &s;ame &s;ervice, but which were treated in different manners by their re&s;pective &s;urgeons.&mdash;The He&s;&s;ians were all of them inveterate enemies to the bark; and there were ever &s;ome of the Briti&s;h &s;urgeons who employed it very &s;paringly. The mor|tality among the troops tru&s;ted to the care of tho&s;e, was uniformly in great proportion. There was a He&s;&s;ian regiment, the &s;ituation of which I had the opportunity of knowing exactly, that lo&s;t one third of its men by this di&s;ea&s;e and its effects, during one year's &s;ervice in Georgia. There were Briti&s;h regiments al&s;o, which lo&s;t more than a fourth; while there were others, which did not lo&s;e a twentieth. The whole of the&s;e regiments were engaged on the &s;ame &s;ervices; they were all alike foreigners in America; and there appeared to be no obvious cau&s;e for &s;o great a differ|ence in the degree of mortality, except a difference in the management of the bark. Bark was &s;carcely ever employed in one ca&s;e; in another it was u&s;ed with timidity; whil&s;t it was given with the earlie&s;t opportunity, and in quantities far exceeding the u&s;ual practice in the third.</P>
<P>I have de&s;cribed, in the preceeding pages, the me|thod which I adopted in the cure of the intermitting fever of America, whil&s;t that fever pre&s;erved its di&s;|tinct and proper form. I have likewi&s;e mentioned the be&s;t means I am acquainted with, of guarding again&s;t its return; and it will not be improper in the next place, that I add a few remarks on &s;ome of its mo&s;t u&s;ual and formidable effects. The intermitting fever of America &s;hewed a &s;trong di&s;po&s;ition to
<PB N="216" REF="028890_0225_0FDE5E7A794B1958">
change into a &s;pecies of dy&s;entery, or a purging and griping at particular &s;ea&s;ons of the year, and more e&s;pecially in particular local &s;ituations. Drop&s;y was likewi&s;e a frequent effect of this complaint, and ob|&s;tructions of the vi&s;cera were not by any means un|common, where the intermittent, from neglect or other circum&s;tances, had been allowed to go on in an uninterrupted cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The changes from intermitting fever to dy&s;entery, and from dy&s;entery to intermitting fever, were &s;o fre|quent in the months of Augu&s;t and September, that tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es &s;eemed evidently to depend on the &s;ame general cour&s;e; a&s;&s;uming at different times the one or the other form from cau&s;es which we could &s;el|dom a&s;certain. In tho&s;e ca&s;es of dy&s;entery the &s;tools were uncommonly copious and watery, and remi&s;&s;ions and exacerbations frequently appeared at regular pe|riods; but though the cure was often attempted by the bark, it did not in general &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t begin with acknowledging, that I &s;hall not be able to give a complete or accurate hi&s;tory of the progre&s;s and final termination of this &s;pecies of dy|&s;entery, into which the intermitting fever is &s;o much di&s;po&s;ed to degenerate; as I &s;hall likewi&s;e only have it in my power to mention the general methods of cure, which were pur&s;ued in the earlier &s;tages of the di&s;ea&s;e. Where it was found that a cure could not be accompli&s;hed in a rea&s;onable time in the field or regimental ho&s;pital, dy&s;enteric patients were generally removed to places where they could meet with better accommodation; &s;o that the di&s;ea&s;e in its latter &s;tages has &s;eldomer fallen under my ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t ob&s;erve in the fir&s;t place, that this &s;pecies of dy&s;entery had no right to be con&s;idered as an in|fectious di&s;ea&s;e. It appeared in fact to be no more than an intermitting fever, which, from &s;ome cau&s;e or other excited its principal force on the alimentary ca|nal. Remi&s;&s;ions and exacerbations were generally
<PB N="217" REF="028890_0226_0FDE5F42433E46C8">
ob&s;ervable in the one di&s;ea&s;e, as well as in the other in the earlier &s;tages; yet the&s;e appearances became gradually le&s;s and le&s;s remarkable, and there appeared at la&s;t marks of permanent affection of the inte&s;tines. The &s;kin now became dry and har&s;h, the fle&s;h wa&s;ted, and the bowels were uncommonly irritable, particu|larly where the <HI>prickly heat</HI> had retired from the &s;ur|face; the di&s;ea&s;e was now evidently &s;upported by the exi&s;tence of permanent local affection.</P>
<P>With regard to the cure of this &s;pecies of com|plaint I have little to ob&s;erve, which is not generally known. Bark was &s;ometimes employed to check its cour&s;e; yet I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that bark alone was &s;el|dom found to be &s;ucce&s;sful. Where there were no marks of an actual inflammatory &s;tate of the &s;tomach and bowels, it &s;ucceeded better when joined with aromatics, powder of camomile flowers, and particu|larly with &s;nake root. Laxatives were pre&s;cribed frequently, and &s;eemed often to be proper. They were however more u&s;eful where &s;ome other thing was joined with them, which had the quality of de|termining to the &s;kin. Opium in various forms was a common remed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">; and often a u&s;eful one before there were marks of permanent affection of the in|te&s;tines. Ipecacuanha, or &s;uch preparations of anti|mony as promoted the evacuations by the &s;kin, were frequently combined with it. The great object which I pur&s;ued in this di&s;ea&s;e was to re&s;tore and &s;upport a free per&s;piration, to dimini&s;h the irritability, and to &s;trengthen the tone of the alimentary canal. I was di&s;po&s;ed to expect benefit from warm bathing, fric|tions, &amp;c. but the &s;ituation in which we were placed did not admit of a trial of them. Exerci&s;e was pro|per, and even &s;ome degree of exertion. Change of air was &s;erviceable in many ca&s;es, well &s;ea&s;oned food in &s;ome, and wine in others. The above plan was pur&s;ued in the beginning of the complaint with tole|rable &s;ucce&s;s; but if it failed, or could not, from the

circum&s;tances of the &s;ervice, be properly executed, the di&s;ea&s;e then lo&s;t the remitting form, the body became lean and exhau&s;ted, the &s;tools bloody, with a very irritable &s;tate of the bowels. In &s;uch ca&s;es there was often ulceration, various degrees of inflammation, or ob&s;tructions in the coats of the inte&s;tines. Bli&s;ters applied to abdomen or loins, and kept open, were often &s;erviceable; medicated gly&s;ters, varied according to the nature and &s;eat of the affection, were likewi&s;e of benefit; and in the latter &s;tages I have &s;een much good from the employment of &s;trong a&s;tringents. In illu&s;tration of this I &s;hall mention the ca&s;e of an officer, who was attacked with this &s;pecies of dy&s;en|tery, &s;oon after the &s;iege of Savanna. Every thing, which the medical people of the garri&s;on could &s;ug|ge&s;t was put into execution, without much benefit. The di&s;ea&s;e continued through the whole of the winter without material abatement; the fle&s;h wa&s;ted, the &s;kin became dry, with &s;uch other &s;ymptoms as are u&s;ual in this complaint. In the month of March, a per&s;on of the country recommended the decoction of the bark of a tree, (probably of the &s;pecies of the Simarouba,) which appeared to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a con|&s;iderable &s;hare of a&s;tringency. It checked the purging and griping in&s;tantly; &s;o that the di&s;ea&s;e cea&s;ed for the &s;pace of three weeks. The appetite was good, the &s;tools copious, and in &s;ome degree lienteric. The griping and even purging at la&s;t returned; the decoction was repeated, but had not the &s;ame effects. Other a&s;tringents, the extract of logwood, terra ja|ponica, &amp;c. checked it for a &s;hort time, but no mate|rial ground was gained. He died in the month of May.</P>
<P>Drop&s;y &s;ucceeding, and &s;ometimes alternating with intermitting fever, was not by any means a rare ap|pearance in America, particularly in &s;ome &s;ea&s;ons, and in &s;ome &s;ituations. The &s;wellings generally pre|vailed in every part of the body. They were u&s;ually

leucophlegmatic, though I have al&s;o &s;een &s;ome in&s;tances of tympanitis; a di&s;ea&s;e which was commonly &s;up|po&s;ed to proceed from improper management of the bark.</P>
<P>With regard to the cure of drop&s;ical complaints, I have little to ob&s;erve which is not generally known. It con&s;i&s;ted not only in evacuating the water, but in communicating to the &s;y&s;tem &s;uch a degree of tone and vigour as re&s;i&s;ted farther accumulation. With this view exerci&s;e, and even &s;ome degree of exertion, was proper: wine, even more &s;timulating liquors, high &s;ea&s;oned food, frictions and warm clothing, were &s;erviceable. I &s;hould likewi&s;e have been di&s;|po&s;ed to expect benefit from &s;ea bathing; but I can|not venture to &s;ay, that I have ever made a proper trial of it. Bli&s;ters were al&s;o u&s;eful; not only as occa&s;ioning a di&s;charge of the waters, but as exciting the action of the va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem. Among the nu|merous cla&s;s of diuretics, there is not any one, which has &s;o powerful effects as cantharides, in &s;ub&s;tance or in tincture; and among the corroborants, I &s;hould be inclined to give the preference to chalybeates, colombo root, and Peruvian bark. It may not be improper to mention in this place, that I have &s;een &s;ome in&s;tances where a general ana&s;arca has been completely cured by the accidental &s;upervening of convul&s;ions.</P>
<P>Ob&s;tructions of the abdominal vi&s;cera are like|wi&s;e reckoned among the common effects of inter|mitting fevers. They are frequently attributed to the early or improper u&s;e of bark; but appear in fact generally to ari&s;e from the long continuance of the di&s;ea&s;e. I cannot add any thing to the manner of treating them that is not known to every one.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. A GENERAL REVIEW OF THE PRACTICE OF PRE|CEDING AUTHORS IN FEBRILE DISEASES.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING de&s;cribed the method of cure, which I followed in the remitting fever of Jamaica, the yellow fever and intermitting fever of America; it will not, I hope, be deemed &s;uperfluous to give a &s;hort &s;ketch of the general principles, which have di|rected the practice of phy&s;icians in febrile di&s;ea&s;es, from the days of Hippocrates, till the pre&s;ent times; a &s;ubject of which I have not yet &s;een a connected view. There is rea&s;on to believe that the &s;cience of medicine made con&s;iderable progre&s;s in different parts of the world, particularly in Egypt, at an early period; but di&s;tinct records of the art, prior to the age of Hippocrates, are either lo&s;t, or &s;o blended with the writings which are a&s;&s;igned to that author, that we do not know how to di&s;tingui&s;h them. The practice of Hippocrates in fevers, has been accu&s;ed of being feeble and inert; and it is certain, that many of the mo&s;t effectual remedies of modern times, were unknown to that venerable phy&s;ician; yet if we take the pains to e&s;timate candidly the whole mode of proceeding, we &s;hall be forced to acknowledge, that its effects were le&s;s inactive than has been gene|rally imagined. The mode of treatment adopted by the Coan Sage, &s;eems not only to have done evident good, but &s;ometimes to have actually cut &s;hort the cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e. Sweating at an early period, the mo&s;t effectual means we yet know of cutting off the cour&s;e of fevers, was employed frequently by this author; and though antimonials were then unknown, yet &s;weat, excited by a &s;impler proce&s;s, was often ob&s;erved to produce very deci&s;ive effects. Hippo|crates,
<PB N="221" REF="028890_0230_0FDE5F5238D2E7D0">
indeed, has been le&s;s circum&s;tantial in the detail of remedies than we could have wi&s;hed. He has however related the dietetic part very di&s;tinctly. His rules are always judicious, and his regimen &s;ometimes of &s;uch efficacy, as evidently to operate very con&s;iderable changes in the &s;tate of the &s;y&s;tem. It appears frequently to have been his aim to at|tempt to exterminate the fever in its early periods, or to endeavour to cut &s;hort its cour&s;e abruptly, by direct or indirect oppo&s;ition to its proximate cau&s;e: yet this idea was not pur&s;ued beyond a certain point. After the fourth day had pa&s;&s;ed, Hippocrates u&s;ually contented him&s;elf with &s;upporting the general powers of life with proper diet and nouri&s;hment, allowing nature after that period to perform the work her own way: in other words, to complete the bu&s;ine&s;s by the &s;lower operations of coction and cri&s;is. The&s;e two views, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the attempts to cut &s;hort the di&s;ea&s;e abruptly in its beginning; or in the late periods, the endeavours to &s;upport the powers of life, till the na|tural termination might arrive, comprehend the ge|neral rules of practice followed by this celebrated phy|&s;ician: and I much doubt if the moderns, notwith|&s;tanding all their preten&s;ions, have actually di&s;co|vered any other indications more deci&s;ive, though I willingly allow, that they have made great improve|ments in the mode of executing tho&s;e I have men|tioned. At lea&s;t, I acknowledge for my own part, that I am not yet acquainted with any mode of treat|ment, by which the natural cour&s;e of a continued, or even ob&s;curely remitting fever can certainly be pre|vented, after the fir&s;t days of the di&s;ea&s;e are pa&s;t;&mdash;that is, after a di&s;tinct formation of the type; before that happened, the &s;weating proce&s;s is frequently &s;uc|ce&s;sful. But though the attempt to cut &s;hort the di&s;ea&s;e in its beginning, or to &s;upport the powers of life in the later periods, comprehend this author's general rule of practice; yet we find con&s;iderable
<PB N="222" REF="028890_0231_0FDE5E929283DA58">
diver&s;ity in the manner of accompli&s;hing the&s;e dif|ferent purpo&s;es. The <GAP DESC="foreign">, or an attempt to counteract the derangements of morbid cau&s;es, may be con&s;idered as the fir&s;t general maxim, which was e&s;tabli&s;hed in the cure of di&s;ea&s;es. Hippocrates has this maxim con&s;tantly in his eye, and endeavours by various means, according to a &s;uppo&s;ed diver&s;ity in the mode of action, to cut off the immediate exi&s;t|ence of fever. In this manner the pre&s;ence of heat and bile, or the &s;uppo&s;ition of ob&s;tructed per&s;piration, have &s;everally furni&s;hed him with different indica|tions. His ideas however are not preci&s;e; &s;o that his practice frequently fluctuates between conjecture and experiment. If the di&s;ea&s;e does not yield to one mode of treatment in a given time, he frequently pa&s;&s;es to its oppo&s;ite much at random.</P>
<P>The doctrines of Hippocrates acquired &s;uch gene|ral credit, in every part of the world where they were known, that we do not remark any material innova|tions in the cure of fevers, till the time of Era&s;i&s;tra|tus; a &s;pace of near two hundred years. The inter|vening period, indeed, was di&s;tingui&s;hed by philo&s;o|phers, who employed their time in inve&s;tigating the &s;tructure and economy of the human frame, as well as by phy&s;icians, who improved the art of medicine by the invention of new remedies. Plato, Ari&s;totle and Theophra&s;tus were the mo&s;t eminent of the for|mer; Petro is chiefly di&s;tingui&s;hed among the lat|ter. (1) This author, as we find recorded both by Cel&s;us and Galen, attempted to extingui&s;h a fever by copious drenching with cold water; &s;oon after which, he nouri&s;hed his patient with wine and &s;trong foods, a cu&s;tom which was in &s;ome degree imitated by Clophantus. Hints, however, of the fir&s;t of tho&s;e practices are found in the writings of Hippocrates, &s;o that we may ju&s;tly con&s;ider Era&s;i&s;tratus, as the fir&s;t who departed &s;o far from the principles of the Coan Sage, or who arrived at &s;o high reputation, as to be
<PB N="223" REF="028890_0232_0FDE5F582D8361E8">
regarded by po&s;terity as the author of a new method of curing di&s;ea&s;es. I mentioned in a former part of this treati&s;e, the opinion which Era&s;i&s;tratus enter|tained concerning the cau&s;e of fevers. All that we know of his practice may be compri&s;ed in a few words. Era&s;i&s;tratus was every where the inveterate enemy of bleeding. He was likewi&s;e the author of a certain plan of ab&s;tinence, which, with a little modification from A&s;clepiades and Themi&s;on, made a con&s;picuous figure in the annals of phy&s;ic for &s;everal &s;ucceeding ages.</P>
<P>Herophilus, who lived much about the &s;ame time with Era&s;i&s;tratus, acquired al&s;o high reputation in the medical world; but unfortunately we have it not in our power to give a particular detail of his di&s;|coveries. Soon after the period I have mentioned, the &s;cience of medicine was divided into three di&s;tinct branches; <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> as the art is employed to remove di&s;|ea&s;es by diet, by drugs, or by manual operation. Serapion likewi&s;e, who is con&s;idered as the author of the empiric &s;ect, made his appearance not long after this divi&s;ion of the profe&s;&s;ion into &s;eparate branches. His followers were numerous, and many of them were re&s;pectable; but we are not enabled to give a di&s;tinct account of their practice on the &s;ubject of fevers. The &s;ummary views of Cel&s;us and Pliny, or the accidental fragments in the volu|minous works of Galen, furni&s;h only imperfect in|formation. Contentions, however, ran high between dogmatics and empirics, the former of whom were chiefly guided by rea&s;onings, as the latter tru&s;ted &s;olely to experience.</P>
<P>The Greeks, for many ages, were the only people we are acquainted with, who cultivated the &s;ciences with indu&s;try. For near five hundred years they were almo&s;t exclu&s;ively the profe&s;&s;ors of the healing art. The Romans were cautious of admitting the refinements of learning into their &s;tate; and had
<PB N="242" REF="028890_0233_0FDE5E99AF0BEE18">
nearly attained the height of their glory, before they willingly received phy&s;icians into their city. A&s;cle|piades the Bithynian, the contemporary and friend of Pompey and Cicero, appears to be the fir&s;t, who practi&s;ed medicine at Rome with any degree of re|putation. This author left his native country, with the de&s;ign of in&s;tructing the Roman youth in the arts of eloquence; an acquirement, which was held in high e&s;timation among that warlike people; but not &s;ucceeding in this pur&s;uit, according to his wi&s;hes, he &s;oon di&s;covered, that the profe&s;&s;ion of me|dicine offered a fair opening for the exerci&s;e of his talents. The &s;tate of the art, indeed, was then pe|culiarly propitious to his undertaking; the former &s;ame of Hippocrates being divided between Era&s;i&s;|tratus and Herophilus, and &s;ome authors of the em|piric &s;ect. A&s;clepiades was two di&s;cerning not to perceive, that new doctrines could not fail of drawing followers, and too enterprizing not to attempt to carry this purpo&s;e into execution. He probably, in the fir&s;t place, read over all that had been written by former phy&s;icians; the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential parts of which, he &s;elected with a good deal of art, and &s;o modified as to form a &s;y&s;tem, which appeared to be complete, and which exhibited upon the whole, con&s;iderable appearances of novelty. If we take the pains to trace his opinions to their &s;ources, we &s;hall find that Democrites or Epicurus furni&s;hed him with his phi|lo&s;ophy, that Herodicus &s;upplied him with the hints of bathing, friction, and ge&s;tation, that the plan of ab&s;tinence, or fa&s;ting for three days, was learnt from Era&s;i&s;tratus; and that Petro and Cleophantus in|&s;tructed him in the practice of giving cold water, and of allowing greater indulgence in the u&s;e of wine.&mdash;But though the authors I have mentioned furni&s;hed A&s;clepiades with the hints of his doctrines and prac|tice; yet we may ob&s;erve, that he has always mo|delled the&s;e after his own fa&s;hion, and carried them
<PB N="225" REF="028890_0234_0FDE5F5DB1618E48">
farther than had ever been done by their original in|ventors. It was remarked above, that the profe&s;&s;ion of medicine was divided into different &s;ects before the time of A&s;clepiades; yet, as far as we can judge from the imperfect information which has been tran&s;|mitted to us, this author was the fir&s;t, who de&s;erves the name of an active phy&s;ician. Previous to the time of this enterprizing Bythynian, medical men tru&s;ted the cure of fevers chiefly to the efforts of nature; and were only &s;olicitous about the mode of death. A&s;clepiades, a&s;&s;uming a bolder principle, en|deavoured to cut &s;hort the fever in the mid&s;t of its cour&s;e: and it is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that by &s;tep|ping &s;uddenly from the extremes of torture to the highe&s;t gratification of the appetites, &s;uch changes were effected in the &s;tate of the &s;y&s;tem, as probably &s;ometimes accompli&s;hed the purpo&s;e. Such were the general views of this author. It may not be im|proper to add a few remarks on &s;ome of the remedies which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e employed.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ix the date, when friction and warm bathing were fir&s;t numbered among the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ances of the phy&s;icians. They appear, however, from the te&s;timony of Cel&s;us, to have been u&s;ed with caution by the ancients. A&s;clepiades not only in|dulged in them with freedom, but &s;o conducted the management of bathing, that it might be ju&s;tly con|&s;idered as a luxury of the highe&s;t elegance. Ge&s;ta|tion, another of the gymna&s;tic remedies employed by this author, even in an early period of ardent fever, is an experiment of a &s;till bolder and more de&s;perate kind; and &s;uch as &s;ucceeding writers with one voice &s;eem to have condemned:&mdash;perhaps without examin|ation or fair trial. I am &s;en&s;ible that the opinion, which I am to offer on this &s;ubject, is not likely to meet with general approbation; but the opportunity which I enjoyed, during the late war, of &s;erving with a regiment, which was almo&s;t con&s;tantly in the
<PB N="226" REF="028890_0235_0FDE5EA06DAB44D8">
field, enables me to confirm the truth of it by ample experience. The good effects of ge&s;tation or tra|velling, even in awkward conveyances, were very obvious in almo&s;t every &s;tage and &s;ituation of the ardent bilious fever; but I &s;hall relate &s;ome in&s;tances of its &s;ucce&s;s, which appear to preclude all po&s;&s;ibility of doubt. At Ebenezer in Georgia, at a &s;ea&s;on, when the thermometer, in the coole&s;t part of the hou&s;e, often &s;tood at ninety-&s;ix, and even &s;ometimes ro&s;e above it, I was &s;eized with the ardent bilious fever, which at that time made dreadful ravage among the troops. For &s;ix or &s;even days I did not once &s;hut my eyes; my thir&s;t was great, yet every &s;ort of liquid, which I could procure, was nau&s;eous; the di&s;tinction of paroxy&s;m and remi&s;&s;ion was no longer perceivable; the pul&s;e, at the wri&s;t, was neither un|commonly frequent nor &s;trong; but the pul&s;ation of the de&s;cending aorta was &s;o great, as to &s;hake the whole frame; anxiety and re&s;tle&s;sne&s;s were in|tolerable: in &s;hort, the torment was &s;o exce&s;&s;ive, that human nature could &s;carcely &s;uffer more. The &s;ituation was precarious; and without much re|flexion I indulged the de&s;ire of being carried to Sa|vanna; though the di&s;tance was not le&s;s than twenty-five miles. An open carriage, the only conveyance which the country afforded, was provided for the pur|po&s;e; and I was put into it, in a very feeble and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed condition. Fortunately the day was cloudy, and cooler than ordinary. The roads were likewi&s;e &s;oft and &s;andy. Though the carriage was very de|fective, the motion was no ways unplea&s;ant; and I had not travelled two miles before I felt a wonderful increa&s;e of vigour. It rained heavily about half way, and before I reached Savanna, I was drenched to the &s;kin. The effects which might have been expected, did not follow. In&s;tead of being hurt, I was &s;ur|prizingly benefited. I walked into the hou&s;e with &s;trength and firmne&s;s, eat &s;omething without di&s;like,
<PB N="227" REF="028890_0236_0FDE5F645C251400">
and &s;lept &s;ound the following night; in &s;hort, obtained a perfect remi&s;&s;ion of the fever. This is a &s;trong in&s;tance of the good effects of travelling in fevers; yet it is only a &s;olitary one. I &s;hall add another, which places the fact on a &s;till firmer ba&s;is. I men|tioned in a former part of this treati&s;e, that while the 71&s;t regiment lay at the Cheraws, the endemic of the country prevailed among the men in a mo&s;t un|u&s;ual degree. The di&s;ea&s;e was often without di&s;tinc|tion of paroxy&s;m and remi&s;&s;ion; the anxiety and re&s;tle&s;sne&s;s were intolerable, bilious vomitings and purgings were frequent, and exce&s;&s;ive. While near two hundred men were in this &s;ituation, an order arrived for abandoning the po&s;t. It being impo&s;&s;ible, as we were &s;ituated, to provide waggons to tran&s;port &s;o great a number of &s;ick, about forty of tho&s;e who were lea&s;t likely to be &s;oon fit for &s;ervice were &s;ent down the river in boats. Of the particular fate of this party I cannot &s;peak with certainty; but I have the &s;atisfaction to add, that not a man died of tho&s;e who retired to Camden by land; aud that after the third day, &s;carcely a fever was left, which had not a&s;&s;umed a regular intermitting form. This appears at fir&s;t &s;ight almo&s;t an incontrovertible proof of the &s;alutary effects of ge&s;tation; but I mu&s;t not at the &s;ame time omit to mention, that benefit al&s;o probably re&s;ulted from a change, which accidentally happened in the &s;tate of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> weather. The weather, (which, during the time we remained at the Cheraws was uncommonly hot,) became unexpectedly cool after the march was begun; together with rain, from which the &s;ick men had nothing to &s;helter them&s;elves. This in&s;tance of expo&s;ure to rain furni&s;hes a proof of a fact of much importance. It is generally believed that getting wet with rain is hurtful to a per&s;on in health. It is no le&s;s commonly &s;uppo&s;ed to be cer|tainly pernicious in &s;ickne&s;s; but the contrary ap|pears to be &s;ometimes the ca&s;e. I have &s;een the happie&s;t effects from the application of cold, even
<PB N="228" REF="028890_0237_0FDE5EA69D11AE50">
from getting accidentally wet with rain in many in|&s;tances, be&s;ides the pre&s;ent. Increa&s;e of tone and vigour was generally the con&s;equence; and life was evidently protracted, &s;ometimes perhaps &s;aved, by accidents, or modes of treatment, which, in the com|mon opinion of mankind, would have been reckoned the cau&s;es of death.&mdash;But though I have mentioned the accidental good effects of ge&s;tation, and even of expo&s;ure to rain in different &s;tates of the ardent fe|ver; I &s;hall not be &s;o paradoxical, as to recommend &s;uch experiments in common practice. I mu&s;t how|ever be allowed to ob&s;erve, that we have little cau&s;e to be afraid of their pernicious effects. Motion and travelling, as far as my experience goes, were con|&s;tantly hurtful in ca&s;es of local pain and inflammation; or in derangement of intellect; but, on the contrary, con&s;tantly &s;erviceable in anxiety and re&s;tle&s;sne&s;s, de|pending on the &s;tate of the &s;tomach; as al&s;o in af|fections of the biliary &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>I mentioned before, that A&s;clepiades practi&s;ed me|dicine at Rome with great reputation. He propa|gated his doctrines with a good deal of &s;ucce&s;s; but &s;uch is, and ever has been the fate of our conjectural art, that no &s;y&s;tem has yet pre&s;erved its credit undi|mini&s;hed for any length of time. The views of phy|&s;icians, with regard to di&s;ea&s;es, had hitherto been va|rious and complex; even fevers had been often con|&s;idered, by the &s;ame per&s;on, as depending on differ|ent cau&s;es. Themi&s;on, a pupil of A&s;clepiades, at|tempted to remedy the perplexity which nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;es from this in&s;tability of arbitrary conjecture; and endeavoured to reduce all the di&s;orders, to which the human body is liable, to two general cla&s;&s;es;&mdash;<ABBR>viz.</ABBR> to tho&s;e which ari&s;e from an increa&s;ed degree of &s;tricture, or its oppo&s;ite affection, preternatural laxity; to which he afterwards &s;ubjoined &s;ome complaints, which appeared to partake of the nature of both.&mdash;The idea of &s;implifying di&s;ea&s;es did not probably ari&s;e
<PB N="229" REF="028890_0238_0FDE5F696DAFBD60">
in the mind of Themi&s;on, till the latter period of his life; on which account, perhaps, the doctrines were left in &s;ome mea&s;ure unfini&s;hed; and it is to The&s;&s;a|lus, who lived in the time of Nero, that we are in|debted for completing the methodic &s;y&s;tem, and for enlarging the bounds of its &s;ame. Soranus likewi&s;e added to its credit. It is a misfortune, which we mu&s;t regret, that except Coelius Aurelianus, there is not one of the many authors who were attached to the tenets of this &s;ect, who&s;e works have e&s;caped the wreck of accident or time. This only remaining author appears to have copied, by his own confe&s;&s;ion, almo&s;t literally from Soranus.</P>
<P>It does not belong to this place to enter deeply into the tenets of the &s;ect, with regard to di&s;ea&s;es in gene|ral; but leads to views of &s;ome importance in the theory and treatment of many di&s;orders. It proceeds on the &s;uppo&s;ition of circulation in all parts of the body; and with a little latitude may be &s;uppo&s;ed to comprehend the affections of the animated &s;olid or contractile fibre. Fever is con&s;idered by the writers of this &s;y&s;tem, as a di&s;ea&s;e of the cla&s;s of &s;tricture; and if we had authority to add &s;pa&s;modic, we might believe the methodics had di&s;covered a very impor|tant phenomenon in the hi&s;tory of febrile di&s;ea&s;es.&mdash;But this &s;ome may think is granting them too much. If we take the trouble to trace their doctrine, re|&s;pecting the cau&s;e of fever, to its &s;ource, we &s;hall find that the hints of it are furni&s;hed expre&s;sly by A&s;cle|piades, who perhaps borrowed his ideas on the &s;ub|ject from Era&s;i&s;tratus, or even from Hippocrates.&mdash;But as &s;tricture, a&s;&s;igned by the writers of the me|thodic &s;ect as the cau&s;e of fever, is not perhaps radi|cally different from the ob&s;truction of preceding au|thors; &s;o we do not find much material difference in their manner of conducting the cure. The followers of Hippocrates, Era&s;i&s;tratus and Themi&s;on proceeded equally on the idea of re&s;toring permeability in the
<PB N="230" REF="028890_0239_0FDE5EAC4D59F800">
minuter canals of the &s;y&s;tem; a purpo&s;e which they conceived would be be&s;t affected by certain proce&s;&s;es of attenuation and relaxation. Thus Hippocrates diluted plentifully, and gave nouri&s;hment only &s;par|ingly, during the fir&s;t days of a fever. Era&s;i&s;tratus enjoined a general ab&s;tinence, A&s;clepiades pre&s;cribed a term for the duration of the ab&s;tinence; while The|mi&s;on limited it &s;o rigidly to the &s;pace of three days, that the practice was di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of diatriton, as its followers were known by that of dia|tritarii. This idea of diatri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">on con&s;tituted an object of much importance in the &s;y&s;tem of the methodic phy&s;icians. It directed all their movements, and is the only view, which can properly be called their own. The mode of application of the remedies of preceding authors was occa&s;ionally modified by this &s;ect; but except that which I have ju&s;t mentioned, we do not di&s;cover much that is fundamentally new.</P>
<P>It may not be improper in this place to take notice of the practice of cold bathing in fevers, which was introduced at Rome in the infancy of the methodic &s;ect; and which afterwards acquired great celebrity in different parts of the world. The Emperor Au|gu&s;tus, who for the greate&s;t part of his life was af|flicted with ill health, was at la&s;t attacked with a complaint of &s;o ob&s;tinate a kind, that the u&s;ual ap|plications did not afford him any relief. Warm bath|ing and all that train of remedies had been tried in vain. The Emperor was &s;en&s;ible of his de&s;perate &s;ituation; and his phy&s;ician Antoni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s Mu&s;a, baffled in all his attempts, ventured, though apparently at great hazard, to pre&s;cribe the cold bath. The health of Augu&s;tus was unexpectedly re&s;tored by it; and the phy&s;ician was highly honoured, and amply re|warded. It is a misfortune that we do not know the &s;pecific nature of the di&s;ea&s;e, under which the Em|peror laboured; but we have rea&s;on to conclude, from the circum&s;tances which attended the cure, that it
<PB N="231" REF="028890_0240_0FDE5F7046778098">
was a fever of a bilious remitting kind; perhaps com|plicated with catarrhal affection, and wa&s;ting of the body. But though the &s;ucce&s;s of cold bathing, in the in&s;tance I have mentioned, was much greater than expectation; yet the remedy did not long <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">retain its credit. It was &s;oon afterwards employed in the ca&s;e of Marcellus, a youth of great hopes, and pre&s;ump|tive heir to the empire; but the event proving un|fortunate, it fell &s;uddenly into di&s;repute,&mdash;probably without &s;ufficient cau&s;e. We find however that Cel|&s;us, in le&s;s than half a century, afterwards ventured to recommend it in a certain &s;pecies of the flow or hectic fever; though Charmes, a phy&s;ician of Mar|&s;eilles, appears actually to be the fir&s;t who rendered the u&s;e of the remedy general. Galen employed it frequently with great freedom and boldne&s;s. The Arabians, particularly in pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es, went &s;till farther than the Greeks or Romans; and we pre&s;ume, from the fact recorded by Bu&s;bequius, that it was &s;ometimes pre&s;cribed at Con&s;tantinople, even &s;o late as the &s;ixteenth century. I do not know that it has been often tried in Europe, &s;ince the revival of the medical &s;ciences in the We&s;t. I mentioned in a former part of this treati&s;e, that I had employed it frequently in the fevers of Jamaica; I now add, that I have ventured upon it in the fevers of this country with &s;o great &s;ucce&s;s, that I &s;hould expect the mo&s;t beneficial effects might re&s;ult from a proper manage|ment of it.

<P>We are indebted to Cel&s;us, who lived in the time of Tiberius, for pre&s;erving many of the opinions and practices of preceding phy&s;icians, which other|wi&s;e would probably have been lo&s;t. This author, not le&s;s remarkable for candour, than for the elegance and per&s;picuity of his manner of writing, does not &s;eem to have been blindly devoted to the tenets of any particular &s;ect. He has favoured us with valuable extracts from the works of the mo&s;t celebrated dog|matics;
<PB N="232" REF="028890_0241_0FDE5EB366A37AC0">
he has likewi&s;e taken notice of the mo&s;t re|markable opinions and practices of the Empirics, without omitting to mention the innovations of A&s;|clepiades and Themi&s;on. With regard to his par|ticular merit as a phy&s;ician, we may ob&s;erve that he every where di&s;covers an excellent judgment, and that his practice is generally decided without being ra&s;h.</P>
<P>So great have been the ravages of time or accident among the writings of the early phy&s;icians, that it is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible altogether to avoid error in at|tempting to trace the various revolutions in medical practice, prior to the time of Galen. From that downwards we are enabled to give a more certain and better connected view of the &s;ubject; there being few of the principal writers of this latter period, who have not been pre&s;erved entire. When Galen came fir&s;t to Rome, which was in the time of the Emperor Antoninus, the practice of medicine was chiefly in the hands of the followers of the methodic &s;y&s;tem. The practice of diatriton, or ab&s;tinence for three days was then in high fa&s;hion, not only with the profe&s;&s;ed pupils of The&s;&s;alus, but even with the few remaining adherents of Era&s;i&s;tratus. Galen every where declares him&s;elf its inveterate enemy; and often tran&s;gre&s;&s;es the bounds of liberality and decency, in his attempts to turn it into ridicule. His own endeavours are expre&s;sly exerted to revive and e&s;tabli&s;h the principles of Hippocrates; and to com|plete tho&s;e parts, which the want of time or the want of experience of his ma&s;ter had left imperfect. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed uncommon fertility of genius, a great flow of language, and a judgment by no means deficient; yet, from a &s;ophi&s;tical &s;pirit of philo&s;ophizing, he frequently &s;o entangled his opinions with theoretical di&s;tinctions, that his views are often uncertain, and &s;ometimes embarra&s;&s;ing. The principle with which he &s;ets out is directly to oppo&s;e the actual exi&s;tence
<PB N="233" REF="028890_0242_0FDE5F76F10BBD88">
of fever; he next recommends to remove, at lea&s;t to avoid an increa&s;e of tho&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> which give ri&s;e to the di&s;ea&s;e. The&s;e ideas are drawn from the writings of Hippocrates, and are &s;uch as no per&s;on will di&s;|pute: but, as the cau&s;es of fever are &s;uppo&s;ed, both by Hippocrates and Galen, to be many and various, &s;o the indications of cure often require to be executed in different, and &s;ometimes in directly oppo&s;ite man|ners. This nece&s;&s;arily gives ri&s;e to confu&s;ion; and entangles the practitioner in the mazes of doubt and conjecture; to obviate which, as much as po&s;&s;ible, the learned commentator of Hippocrates has thought fit to divide fevers into three general kinds, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> ephemeral, continued, and hectic or habitual; the cau&s;es of which he &s;uppo&s;es to be &s;o little analogous to one another, as to demand particular management in the method of cure.</P>
<P>We look in vain for new views, or material im|provements in the management of fevers, in the writings of tho&s;e Greek phy&s;icians who followed Galen. Oriba&s;ius profe&s;&s;edly is no more than a col|lector of the opinions and practices of other men; and Aetius, on the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, does not a&s;pire to much higher fame. There are, indeed, few of his ob&s;ervations, which may not be found in the volumes of Galen, or &s;ome preceding writer; yet he &s;eems generally to have comprehended what he wrote. He dige&s;ted the knowledge which he found in books with care and judgment; and gives an arrangement &s;o clear and per&s;picuous, that the per&s;on may derive information from Aetius, who would be overwhelmed and lo&s;t in the prolixity of Galen's di&s;cu&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>From tho&s;e writers, however, who trod implicitly in the foot&s;teps of Galen, we mu&s;t be allowed to &s;e|parate Alexander of Tralle, a phy&s;ician who lived in the &s;ixth century. This author wrote his book on fevers at a very advanced age; and though the trea|ti&s;e perhaps does not contain many ideas, which may
<PB N="234" REF="028890_0243_0FDE5EBA830D8268">
not, in &s;ome &s;hape or other, be found in the writings of his predece&s;&s;ors, yet the ob&s;ervations have the ap|pearance every where of having originally ari&s;en from actual experience. The language, which is conci&s;e, clear and per&s;picuous, is wholly his own. The am|biguous circum&s;tances of di&s;ea&s;es are more accurately di&s;criminated than in any preceding work which has de&s;cended to the pre&s;ent times; and though the man|ner of accounting for things may be &s;ometimes erro|neous, yet it has had little influence on the practical indications, which are almo&s;t unexceptionably judi|cious. As Alexander of Tralle wrote at a time of life when fame mu&s;t have been indifferent to him, and to a friend, whom he was more &s;olicitous to in|&s;truct than to amu&s;e with the &s;plendour and variety of his learning, we have an additional cau&s;e to give our confidence to his ob&s;ervations. His manner is candid and ingenious; and the treati&s;e before us may be con&s;idered by the practical phy&s;ician, as the mo&s;t valuable of the remains of the ancients. Judicious cautions are every where inter&s;per&s;ed, and con&s;ider|able changes in the management of remedies are &s;ometimes attempted; but the practice of giving opiates in a certain &s;tate of fever is the only practice of this author, which has any title to be called in|novation.</P>
<P>Paulus is the next phy&s;ician of note, who lived after the days of Galen. He was born in the i&s;land of Aegina, and travelled over many countries. It is probable that he was &s;ufficiently acquainted with every di&s;covery, which had been made by his prede|ce&s;&s;ors; yet Galen, on the &s;ubject of fever, is the au|thor who&s;e works he has principally followed. His book on fevers, indeed, contains all the material doc|trines and ob&s;ervations of that voluminous writer; and tho&s;e who dread the labour of encountering the prolix and &s;ophi&s;tical di&s;qui&s;itions of the commentator of Hippocrates, may find a very di&s;tinct analy&s;is

of his opinions and practices in the treati&s;e of Paulus A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">gineta.</P>
<P>Having endeavoured in the preceding pages to give a &s;hort view of the methods which were u&s;ually pur|&s;ued by the mo&s;t eminent of the Greek phy&s;icians, in the cure of fevers, it will be nece&s;&s;ary in the next place to take &s;ome notice of the improvements of their immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, the Arabians. This ta&s;k will be &s;oon performed; the Arabians have not in reality opened any views in the curative indications of febrile di&s;ea&s;es, which were unknown to their prede|ce&s;&s;ors; or which require that we &s;hould &s;pend long time in endeavouring to explain them. The medical &s;cience evidently drew its origin from the Ea&s;t; yet it was al&s;o &s;oon reconveyed to the countries from whence it &s;prung, with improvements and additions from the genius of the Greeks. We learn from Herodotus, that Democedes, a native of Crotone, who had &s;tudied medicine in the i&s;land of Aegina, far excelled all the phy&s;icians of the Per&s;ian court, even &s;o early as the time of the fir&s;t Darius; though the court of this Prince probably could boa&s;t of all the &s;kill, both of A&s;&s;yria and of Egypt. Cle&s;ias &s;ometime after was held in great e&s;timation by Ar|taxerxes; and the invitation, which was held out to Hippocrates by the Per&s;ian monarch, indicates very clearly, that the Greeks, even then, were more famed for medical &s;kill than the inhabitants of the Ea&s;tern countries. The i&s;lands and &s;hores of the Mediter|ranean &s;eem through the whole hi&s;tory of medicine, to have produced the greate&s;t number of phy&s;icians. Crotone and Cyrene were famous for &s;everal ages: and Alexandria, at a later period, ro&s;e into great cele|brity. Students flocked to it from every part of the world; it was even nece&s;&s;ary that every one, who a&s;pired to wealth or reputation in phy&s;ic, &s;hould &s;pend &s;ome time in this celebrated &s;eminary. It was owing perhaps, in &s;ome degree, to the vicinity of
<PB N="236" REF="028890_0245_0FDE5EC09D2CFA98">
this illu&s;trious &s;chool, that the province of Syria en|joyed at one time, a con&s;iderable &s;hare of learning and learned men. The works of the mo&s;t eminent of the Greek phy&s;icians were tran&s;lated into the dialect of the Syrian country, in the &s;eventh and eighth centuries; by which means they were pro|bably, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, propagated in the Ea&s;t: though we al&s;o are informed by Abulpharage, an Arabic writer, who had pre&s;erved many curious anecdotes of private hi&s;tory, that the doctrines of Hippocrates were planted in the Chora&s;an, at a &s;till earlier age, by the phy&s;icians, who followed in the train of Aurelian's daughter, who was married to Sapores king of Per&s;ia: nor is it improbable, that the&s;e doctrines were &s;till more generally diffu&s;ed through the Per&s;ian dominions, by the alliances of friend&s;hip, as well as by the long wars, which were afterwards carried on between the Greek empire and the celebrated Khorrou Pawiz. But though the in|habitants of Syria and Irak were an enlightened na|tion, at an early period; their neighbours, the Ara|bians, who afterwards attained &s;o great a name in &s;cience no le&s;s than in war, remained long in a &s;tate of illiterate ignorance. Before the e&s;tabli&s;hment of i&s;lami&s;m, there &s;carcely was a native Arab, who could either write or read. The little genius they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed was chiefly exerted in compo&s;ing ver&s;es, or in colour|ing a rhetorical harangue. They appear, indeed, to have acquired &s;ome practical knowledge of the mo|tions of the heavenly bodies; and it is likewi&s;e rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that they had the &s;ame &s;kill in medicine, as is common to &s;avage nations; but there is no rea&s;on to believe, that they, as yet, had made progre&s;s in the medical art, con&s;idered in a &s;cientific view. Hareth, a native of Tayef, who lived in the time of the prophet, and who &s;eems to have been in habits of intimacy with that &s;ingular man, is the fir&s;t of the Arabs, who&s;e name is recorded among the
<PB N="237" REF="028890_0246_0FDE5F8219FDEA58">
phy&s;icians of the Ea&s;t. This per&s;on, who acquired &s;ome knowledge of medicine at Ni&s;abour, and other places in the Chora&s;an, returned home after &s;ome time, with great wealth, and no &s;mall &s;hare of fame. He practi&s;ed among his countrymen with much re|putation; but how far he &s;pread the light of &s;cience among them is uncertain. The Saracens advanced rapidly in conque&s;ts and the e&s;tabli&s;hment of their faith; but we do not hear any thing of their pro|gre&s;s in the healing art, till the ninth century. Syrians and Per&s;ians, generally of the Jewi&s;h or Chri&s;tian religion, laboured &s;ometimes for the warlike Arabs in the &s;ervile occupation of curing di&s;ea&s;es, at lea&s;t we do not know that any of the Saracens attained much eminence in medical &s;cience, till the tran&s;la|tions of Honain and his pupils laid open to them the trea&s;ures of the Greeks. We are ill qualified at this period to judge of the merit of the&s;e tran&s;lations. But if we may be allowed to form conclu&s;ions, from the u&s;e which has been made of them, we &s;hall not, per|haps, be di&s;po&s;ed to entertain a very high opinion of their accuracy. In many in&s;tances, the later Ara|bian phy&s;icians have expre&s;&s;ed the ideas of Hippo|crates and Galen only very loo&s;ely; and in &s;ome few ca&s;es, perhaps, have not very clearly comprehended their meaning. But, as the later Saracens were &s;eldom &s;killed in any language except their own; the original tran&s;lators are probably alone blameable for the whole of the&s;e mi&s;takes.</P>
<P>The medical authors, who wrote in the Arabic language between the ninth and fifteenth centuries, and, who &s;till lie concealed in the le&s;s acce&s;&s;ible dre&s;s of their native country, are almo&s;t innumerable: nei|ther are tho&s;e, who have been introduced into the common acquaintance of Europeans few in number, or &s;mall in volume. If I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a complete &s;eries, even of tho&s;e who are commonly known in Europe, the examination I have entered upon might be drawn
<PB N="238" REF="028890_0247_0FDE5F87A7F6AAC8">
out to a con&s;iderable length; but as I have no hopes of obtaining that &s;oon, I &s;hall content my&s;elf with giv|ing &s;ome idea of the Arabian &s;y&s;tem of practice in fevers, from the works of Avicenna, the mo&s;t emi|nent and be&s;t known of the Oriental phy&s;icians. An ex|amination, indeed, of one of the writers of this nation may, in a great mea&s;ure, render an inquiry into the others unnece&s;&s;ary. Tho&s;e, at lea&s;t whom I have &s;een, do not differ materially from one another; or perhaps e&s;&s;entially from the Greeks who went be|fore them. The canon medicine, the principal work of Avicenna, exhibits a &s;y&s;tematic view of the whole art of medicine, theoretical as well as practical. I have read over with care all that relates to fevers; and though there is little, perhaps which may not ul|timately be traced to Galen or Hippocrates; yet the author has not copied &s;ervilely from either of them. He is more full and particular than the one; le&s;s pro|lix and tedious than the other. I mu&s;t however re|mark, that the di&s;tinctions and divi&s;ions, which he has attempted to introduce into the hi&s;tory of fevers, are not only unnece&s;&s;ary, but actually &s;erve to em|barra&s;s the indications of cure. His general theo|ries are tho&s;e of Galen. In the general conduct of the cure, he treads in the foot&s;teps of the &s;ame ma&s;ter. He appears, indeed, to be more fearful of the lancet; while he is not perhaps always judicious, or con&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf, in the manner of employ|ing it. On the contrary he has admitted cool air ra|ther more freely, and has perhaps carried cold drink even to a bolder length, than had been done by the Greeks. Cool air, cold drink, and even the external application of cold, may be reckoned among the mo&s;t effectual remedies in the fevers of hot climates; and this author has conducted the management of them, in a luxurious, elegant and efficacious manner. But though the works of Avicenna furni&s;h a general view of the practice of the Arabian &s;chool of phy&s;ic, it is &s;till in &s;ome degree a defective one. As he has not
<PB N="239" REF="028890_0248_0FDE601F7580D2B8">
furni&s;hed us with a detail of the ca&s;e of an individual, we are not able to judge preci&s;ely of his powers of di&s;cerning the di&s;ea&s;e, or of his deci&s;ion in the manner of treating it.</P>
<P>The medical &s;cience, which after the taking of Alexandria was little cultivated by the &s;lothful Greeks, or barbarous nations of the We&s;t, &s;prung up with new vigour in the province of Syria, in Irak and Arabia; and followed every where in the train of the Saracen conquerors. Extending with their arms over the northern coa&s;ts of Africa, it &s;oon found its way into Spain; and, even &s;o early as the eleventh century, was conveyed to Salernum in Italy, by Con&s;tantinus Africanus, a native of Carthage, who had lived long in A&s;ia, and who was well acquainted with the lan|guage and medical knowledge of the Orientals. The Arabians were the fir&s;t who opened the &s;ources of che|mi&s;try; they al&s;o made great improvements in the art of &s;urgery, and even de&s;cribed &s;ome complaints which in earlier ages were not taken notice of but they de|parted but little from the &s;y&s;tem of the Greeks in the management of febrile di&s;ea&s;es. After the fall of the Roman empire the genius of learning made no ex|ertion in Europe for a very long period of time. The native European &s;lothfully acquie&s;ced in the im|perfect knowledge of Arabian writers, which was obtained from the inelegant, and perhaps often un|faithful tran&s;lations of the Jews, who, for a con&s;ider|able time, were no contemptible profe&s;&s;ors of the medical art. But, though &s;ome part of the knowledge of the Arabian phy&s;icians was communicated, in this manner to the nations of the We&s;t, in the eleventh and twelfth centuries; yet a part of the &s;ixteenth pa&s;|&s;ed over, before it was po&s;&s;ible to trace any marks of improvement. Commentaries were written without number; but, for many years, there &s;carcely was an individual in all the &s;eminaries of Europe who dared to think for him&s;elf. It has been cu&s;tomary to date
<PB N="240" REF="028890_0249_0FDE5F8ECC3C62A0">
the revival of &s;ciences in the We&s;t from the taking of Con&s;tantinople, by which the &s;tores of Greek lite|rature were in &s;ome degree opened to the world. The language of Galen began then to be more generally under&s;tood, and the writings of Avicenna fell rapidly into neglect; yet the advantage which accrued to medicine from the change, does not appear to have been great. The mind was exerci&s;ed in a wider field of learning; but it was &s;till in chains to the authority of the ancients. The opinions of Galen and Hippo|crates were copied, recopied and commented upon by hundreds; but there were very few who ventured to u&s;e any judgment of their own. Among the mo&s;t cele|brated of the followers of Galen we may reckon Fer|nelius, Fore&s;tus, Lommius and Senn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rtus, men of con&s;iderable talents, but who were too &s;crupulou&s;ly devoted to the principles of their ma&s;ter, to open a new road in the practice of the art. This was re|&s;erved for Paracel&s;us, who early in the &s;ixteenth cen|tury ventured to attack the opinions of his predece&s;|&s;ors, and the authority of Galen. Paracel&s;us po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a con&s;ummate &s;hare of a&s;&s;urance, together with know|ledge of remedies which were not generally known at that time. He acquired &s;ome acquaintance with the chemical di&s;coveries of the Arabians, in the cour&s;e of his various travels, and applied in practice what he had learned, on his return to his native country. He de&s;pi&s;ed the authority of the regular phy&s;icians, em|ployed remedies with great boldne&s;s, and often with &s;ingular &s;ucce&s;s. This &s;ucce&s;s was even very pro|bably exaggerated by report; and there appear to have been many, who followed him implicitly; while others exerted them&s;elves in modifying and improving his ideas. Under this la&s;t view we may rank Van Helmont, a per&s;on, who effected a very material innovation in the manner of curing febrile di&s;ea&s;es. Van Helmont po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed con&s;iderable learning; but di&s;covered, at the &s;ame time &s;uch marks of warmth and enthu&s;ia&s;m of
<PB N="241" REF="028890_0250_0FDE602587ACBCA8">
genius, as dimini&s;hed his credit with contemporary and &s;ucceeding practitioners. The terms which he employs, are &s;ometimes ridiculous; and his rea&s;onings are frequently disfigured with fancy and whim; yet his ideas are generally important, and often well founded. The archaeus of this author does not differ materially from the &s;entient principle (<GAP DESC="foreign">) of Hippocrates; and perhaps comprehends the whole idea of the vis medicatrix naturae of the moderns. Van Helmont proceeds to the cure of fever on the important principle of exciting, or calling forth the powers of life, to exterminate an offending cau&s;e; &s;o that we may actually con&s;ider him as the fir&s;t, after A&s;clepiades, who attempted to take the bu&s;ine&s;s wholly out of the hands of nature.

where gave &s;cope to the imagination, which often in|dulged in the wilde&s;t extravagance of conjecture. Among the number of tho&s;e conjecturers, who ar|rived at much eminence and &s;ame, we may reckon Sylvius de le Bae, who lived in the end of the la&s;t century, and introduced a con&s;iderable innovation in the manner of treating fevers. His theories are ge|nerally known. They appear to be totally de&s;titute of foundation; yet unfortunately are the ground|work of all his practical indications. His principal view con&s;i&s;ts, in regulating the mixtures of bile and pancreatic juice. He likewi&s;e lays &s;o great a &s;tre&s;s upon the nature of the occa&s;ional cau&s;e, as gives ri&s;e to doubt and ambiguity. Thus he &s;ometimes pre|&s;cribes acids, though oftener aromatics, volatiles, and opiates. But as we po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ome ca&s;es, which he ap|pears to have healed, in the Leyden ho&s;pital, with all his &s;kill and attention, we are enabled with more certainty to form a judgment of the particular merits of his practice. It has not any claim to extraordinary &s;ucce&s;s; yet it is evidently innocent of the great harm which &s;ome later authors have imputed to it. In &s;hort, if we except opiates, we may con&s;ider the re&s;t of his remedies as very feeble and ineffectual.</P>
<P>During the time that Sylvius flouri&s;hed in Hol|land, a new theory of fevers was offered to the public in England by Dr. Willis, the celebrated author, to whom we are &s;o much indebted for bringing into view the importance of the nervous &s;y&s;tem, in the economy of the human frame. It does not however appear, that this writer's theory ever extended far, or that it was the cau&s;e of much innovation in practice.</P>
<P>The method of treatment, which was generally adopted in the fevers of England, at the time when Sydenham began to &s;tudy medicine, con&s;i&s;ted prin|cipally in bleeeding, in vomiting with antimonials, in evacuating the inte&s;tinal canal by means of gly&s;ters or gentle laxatives; and, in the latter periods of the
<PB N="243" REF="028890_0252_0FDE602C64A6C830">
di&s;ea&s;e, in attempting to rai&s;e &s;weat by hotter alexi|pharmics. In the fir&s;t con&s;titution of &s;ea&s;ons de&s;|cribed by this author, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the years 1661,-62,-63,- and 64, we do not find any material deviation from this general plan of cure; which was the plan fol|lowed by Willis, and other contemporary phy&s;icians. In the next con&s;titution, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the years 1667, 68 and part of 69, Sydenham forces him&s;elf on our ob&s;erva|tion by an attempt to effect a very important inno|vation. The fever which prevailed during the la&s;t mentioned years was generally of long duration. It was u&s;ually accompanied with profu&s;e &s;weatings, and often di&s;tingui&s;hed by petechial eruptions. Cordials, and hot regimen were &s;ometimes ob&s;erved to cut &s;hort its cour&s;e abruptly; yet dangerous &s;ymptoms were &s;till more frequently the con&s;equence of this &s;timulating mode of treatment, than a favourable ter|mination. The &s;agacious Sydenham, in&s;tructed by repeated experience of the bad effects of this common method of cure, adopted a contrary one; which he pur&s;ued with boldne&s;s, and apparently with great &s;uc|ce&s;s. It may not be improper to ob&s;erve in this place, that our author is not to be con&s;idered as the inventor of the antiphlogi&s;tic method of treating fevers. The ancients, particularly the Arabians, carried the cooling &s;y&s;tem &s;till farther than the moderns. About this time however it had fallen into general neglect; and Sydenham undoubtedly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the merit of re&s;toring it; more perhaps from his own ob&s;ervation, than from a knowledge of what had been done by his predece&s;&s;ors. Part of the year 1669, the years 1670,-1671 and 1672, form another con&s;titution of &s;ea&s;ons, according to this author's arrangement of di&s;ea&s;es. The epidemic a&s;&s;umed a different appear|ance from the former. It was chiefly di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;ymptoms of dy&s;enteric affection. Our author, however, &s;till adhered to the outlines of the antiphlo|gi&s;tic plan; and treated the di&s;ea&s;e &s;ucce&s;sfully with
<PB N="244" REF="028890_0253_0FDE5F9B71778B30">
bleeding, and the repeated u&s;e of laxatives. The method of treatment, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> adopted, admits of a remark. In the former epidemic, the profu&s;e &s;weat|ings were checked; in the pre&s;ent, the inte&s;tinal evacuations were encouraged; in one ca&s;e he ap|peared to promote, in the other to thwart the inten|tions of nature; practices &s;o oppo&s;ite that we can|not ea&s;ily reconcile them. The next con&s;titution, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the years 1673,-74 and 75 di&s;covered a fever with a new train of &s;ymptoms, and in Sydenham's opinion of a very different race. It was principally di&s;tingui&s;hed by pleuretic and rheumatic affections, by coma and &s;tupor. The general antiphlogi&s;tic practice was &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in; and the whole of the cure was tru&s;ted to di&s;cretional bleeding, bli&s;tering the back part of the head and neck, with the repeated employment of gly&s;ters. The hotter diaphoretics were cautiou&s;ly avoided. In the year 1684, this diligent ob&s;erver imagined he di&s;covered the appear|ance of a fever of a perfectly new and unknown kind; a fever accompanied with more or le&s;s derange|ment of intellect, and many other &s;ymptoms of ner|vous affection; the &s;pecies of di&s;ea&s;e, perhaps, which no&s;ologi&s;ts have di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Ty|phus. But though this &s;pecies of fever was &s;uppo&s;ed by our author, to be extremely different in its nature from any that he had yet &s;een, we do not however perceive, that this idea &s;ugge&s;ted to him any material difference in the mode of treatment.</P>
<P>From the &s;hort view which has been given of Sy|denham's practice in fevers, it is ea&s;y to perceive the ri&s;e and progre&s;s of the method of cure which he adopted. Antiphlogi&s;tic proce&s;&s;es were carried to a greater length by the ancients, than the moderns have yet dared to ri&s;k. But there is little rea&s;on to &s;up|po&s;e, that Sydenham owed the ideas of the alterations which he introduced to information from preceding writers. His practice bears every where authentic
<PB N="245" REF="028890_0254_0FDE6032B3E56A68">
marks of having ari&s;en from his own ob&s;ervation.&mdash;The mo&s;t common termination of fevers, is by &s;weat|ing or increa&s;ed per&s;piration; a fault ob&s;erved by Van Helmont, and which furni&s;hed that author with the idea of pro&s;ecuting the cure of the di&s;ea&s;e wholly on this plan. The practice &s;eems to have been early adopted in many parts of Europe; and it even conti|nued in general reputation in England, at the time that Sydenham began his medical &s;tudies. Sweating undoubtedly is often beneficial, and may be con&s;i|dered, upon the whole, as the mo&s;t certain means of exterminating the cau&s;e of fevers; yet bad effects of|ten re&s;ulted from it&mdash;then probably more owing to the manner in which it was conducted, than to the real hurtfulne&s;s of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> thing it&s;elf, viewed in the light of a general remedy. Sydenham, who does not ap|pear to have di&s;criminated between the actual effects of &s;weating and the effects of the manner of exciting it, condemns the practice in general terms, and pa&s;&s;es to an oppo&s;ite method of treatment with a good deal of boldne&s;s. It has ever unfortunately been the fate of phy&s;ic, like every other conjectural art, to pa&s;s from one extreme to its oppo&s;ite by large &s;trides; and thus, even the &s;agacious Sydenham, who had &s;een the bad effects of treating remedies in fevers with much of the inflammatory diathe&s;is, was induced to employ antiphlogi&s;tic proce&s;&s;es in tho&s;e &s;pecies of di&s;|ea&s;e, which we &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed to believe do not well admit of them. The new, or nervous fever, in the opinion of the practitioners of the pre&s;ent age, could not well bear the plentiful evacuations pre&s;cribed by this author; at lea&s;t, we may &s;afely affirm, that &s;uch evacuations are not by any means nece&s;&s;ary.&mdash;But I &s;hall di&s;mi&s;s this &s;ubject with ob&s;erving, that the practice of Sydenham, if we except the article of bleeding, can only be con&s;idered as feeble, and as of|ten in&s;ignificant. His remedies &s;ometimes, perhaps, obviate the fatal tendency of &s;ymptoms; but are not
<PB N="246" REF="028890_0255_0FDE5FA1DDF20BD0">
capable of having any decided effects on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e. I may likewi&s;e add, that his practice is directly at war with the principle of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> theory. If fever is con&s;idered an effort of nature to exterminate &s;omething hurtful from the con&s;titution, bleeding and tho&s;e evacuations, which dimini&s;h the powers of life, are not the proper means of effecting this purpo&s;e. But the truth is, the practice of Sy|denham was his own; his theory was that of the times in which he lived, formed from a mixture of the doctrines of Van Helmont, Campanella and Dr. Willis.</P>
<P>It may not be &s;u&s;pected, perhaps, from the remarks which I have made on the practice of Sydenham in fevers, that I do not con&s;ider him as the author of &s;o much e&s;&s;ential improvement, as has been generally imagined. I mu&s;t however acknowledge, that he de&s;erves the highe&s;t prai&s;e for the accurate and well di&s;criminated hi&s;tory of acute di&s;ea&s;es, which he has left us. The de&s;criptions are complete, and the cir|cum&s;tances &s;o peculiarly cho&s;en, that the di&s;ea&s;e it&s;elf is actually before the eyes of the reader. The&s;e a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> the great, and as yet the unrivalled excellencies of Sydenham; but in admitting &s;uch e&s;&s;ential differences in the cau&s;e of epidemics as he has done, he nece&s;&s;a|rily leads us to embarra&s;&s;ment, and often leaves the practitioner in a &s;tate of uncertainty. The di&s;ea&s;e de&s;cribed by Sydenham, in the various con&s;titutions o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ea&s;ons between the years 1661 and 1685, &s;hews external marks of con&s;iderable diver&s;ity; yet I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that I &s;ee but little rea&s;on for &s;uppo&s;ing, that the&s;e appearances ari&s;e from cau&s;es which are totally and fundamently di&s;tinct. The fever of Sydenham, in all its forms, is in fact the common endemic of England. Circum&s;tances however often aro&s;e then, and &s;till ari&s;e, which modify the general cau&s;e in &s;uch a manner, that the di&s;ea&s;e appears <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> time with &s;ymptoms of inflammatory diathe&s;is, at another with

&s;ymptoms of nervous affection, and at another, with a general di&s;po&s;ition to affections of particular organs. The&s;e modifying cau&s;es, which are more general or particular, more obvious or ob&s;cure, often continue for a certain train of &s;ea&s;ons, and influence very ma|terially the character of the reigning epidemic. The general cau&s;e of the fever is in reality one and the &s;ame, yet I mu&s;t al&s;o acknowledge, that the modifi|cations are evidently many and various, and often very remotely different from each other.</P>
<P>Chemical principles for &s;ome time pa&s;t, had the principal &s;hare in enabling medical writers to account for the phenomena in fevers; but about the end of la&s;t century, the mechanical philo&s;ophy was again revived, and being incorporated with the doctrines of the chemi&s;ts, the laws, and various derangements of the human frame, were then explained on the princi|ples of hydraulics, or chemical mixture. The au|thors who adopted this mode of rea&s;oning were nu|merous, and &s;ome of them were of great eminence; but at pre&s;ent I &s;hall only take notice of one of the greate&s;t of them, the celebrated Boerhaave, who formed a &s;y&s;tem, which was con&s;idered as the mo&s;t perfect that had hitherto been offered to the public. The doctrines of this author acquired uncommon fame. They &s;oon extended over all Europe, and, in|deed, &s;till prevail in the greate&s;t part of it. But though Boerhaave has pre&s;ented us with a methodical explanation of the phenomena in fevers; and has detailed the method of cure with clearne&s;s and pre|ci&s;ion; yet we do not find, that he has furni&s;hed much that is new and original in practice. He is every where cautious, and in mo&s;t in&s;tances judicious; though he has committed a principal error in forming indications of cure, from a &s;uppo&s;ition of lentor and vi&s;cidity; a cau&s;e the very exi&s;tence of which we have every rea&s;on to doubt.</P>
<P>During the time that Boerhaave flouri&s;hed in Hol|land,
<PB N="248" REF="028890_0257_0FDE5FA7E1763538">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> before this author had arrived at much reputa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters"> Profe&s;&s;or Stahl, at Halle in Saxony, pro|po&s;ed &s;ome new opinions, which acquired con&s;iderable fame, and which have been con&s;idered, in &s;ome man|ner, as forming a peculiar &s;y&s;tem. The leading principle of this author, as is confe&s;&s;ed by all, admits only of a feeble and inactive practice. I might even add, that it frequently leads to a pernicious one. Tho&s;e tumults, or &s;ufferings, which pa&s;s by the name of the efforts of nature, are extremely deceitful; and have obviou&s;ly, in many in&s;tances, a de&s;tructive tendency. I mentioned before that they are tru&s;ted with danger; yet Stahl, proceeding on this prin|ciple, boa&s;ts extraordinary &s;ucce&s;s in the cure of the petechial fever, which prevailed in mo&s;t parts of Saxony towards the end of la&s;t century.</P>
<P>In a review of tho&s;e authors, who have written on febrile di&s;ea&s;es, it would be unju&s;t to omit men|tioning Hoffman, contemporary with Stahl, and pro|fe&s;&s;or in the &s;ame univer&s;ity. The actual alterations which this author has introduced into the cure of fevers, are not perhaps very great in them&s;elves; yet his important di&s;coveries, in regard to its theory, entitle him to great con&s;ideration. The mo&s;t of the remedies, which he employed, are found in the writings of his predece&s;&s;ors, or contemporaries; yet they were not, perhaps, always pre&s;cribed by them with the &s;ame intentions. The theory of Hoffman opens a road for the trial of anti&s;pa&s;modics, merely on the footing of anti&s;pa&s;modics; a cla&s;s of remedies of much importance in the cure of febrile di&s;orders. In practice, Hoffman is more decided than Stahl; and his views, perhaps are more exten&s;ive than tho&s;e of Boerhaave. He is likewi&s;e uncommonly candid; and has furni&s;hed us with a great variety of hi&s;tories, which &s;erve in many ca&s;es to illu&s;trate the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The antiphlogi&s;tic method of treating fevers, the
<PB N="249" REF="028890_0258_0FDE603F5D13A638">
ground-work of which was laid by Sydenham, and improved by Boerhaave, prevailed in mo&s;t parts of Europe, without material alteration, till near the pre|&s;ent times. Bli&s;tering with cantharides, which had been employed with caution, and which was even &s;u&s;pected of deleterious effects by many, was intro|duced into practice in the end of the &s;ixteenth cen|tury, aad about the beginning of the pre&s;ent began to be, as employed, a common remedy in many &s;pe|cies of fever: its good effects were often obvious, and, according to the prevailing mode of rea&s;oning, were &s;uppo&s;ed to ari&s;e from a quality which can|tharides were believed to po&s;&s;e&s;s, <HI>of attenuating</HI> the blood. This mode of operation is no longer admitted; but the remedy &s;till retains its credit. Few people pretend that bli&s;ters are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;pecific powers in &s;hortening the cour&s;e of fevers; yet every one al|lows, that they obviate many &s;ymptoms of dangerous tendency, and that they often di&s;po&s;e the di&s;ea&s;e to a&s;&s;ume it proper form. In fevers, accompanied with local affection, their beneficial effects are univer&s;ally acknowledged; and, even in many ca&s;es of general irritability, they often produce very fortunate changes. But I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, with regard to this, that much depends on managment, and the mode of application. In local affections the local application is mo&s;t effec|tual; in ca&s;es accompanied with much general irri|tability, the back part of the head and neck ought, perhaps, to be preferred to others. I have thus fre|quently &s;een in fevers, where there was much general irritability, that bli&s;ters applied to the extremities evidently aggravated the di&s;ea&s;e; while I have al&s;o ob&s;erved, that they as certainly dimini&s;hed the hard|ne&s;s and frequency of the pul&s;e, and di&s;po&s;ed the patient to re&s;t, where they were applied to the back part of the head and neck. There is another remedy that I &s;hall take notice of before leaving this &s;ubject, which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;till higher reputation than bli&s;ters.

Antimonial preparations have been employed occa|&s;ionally in fevers for many years pa&s;t; but they did not gain e&s;tabli&s;hed credit in this country, till within the&s;e thirty years. The di&s;covery of the famous powder of Dr. James appears to have been the cau&s;e of a con&s;iderable innovation, in the manner of treat|ing febrile di&s;ea&s;es. The practice of Boerhaave did not go farther than to obviate &s;ymptoms of fatal tendency; it left the di&s;ea&s;e to pur&s;ue its own cour&s;e. Dr. James a&s;&s;umed a bolder ground, and promi&s;ed to cut &s;hort the fever abruptly by means of his powder. There are many who &s;till tread in his foot&s;teps; I acknowledge, as I have hinted before, that their at|tempts may be often &s;ucce&s;sful in the early &s;tages of the illne&s;s, or often u&s;eful towards a critical period. I cannot however believe, that this powder, or any preparation of antimony with which we are yet ac|quainted, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the power of abruptly terminating a fever wherever it is employed; at lea&s;t, to effect this requires a management of which I confe&s;s my&s;elf ignorant. The effects which Dr. James promi&s;ed from his powder, others have attempted to obtain from emetic tartar; but I have rea&s;on to think with inferior &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The wonderful power, which the Peruvian bark is ob&s;erved to po&s;&s;e&s;s, in &s;u&s;pending the cour&s;e of inter|mittents, has led the practitioners of the pre&s;ent times to employ it, with the &s;ame views, in fevers of various denominations. But after what I have &s;aid of the uncertainty of its effects in checking the cour&s;e of the remitting fever of Jamaica, it will be needle&s;s to repeat here, that I do not expect to find it of much efficacy, in &s;hortening fevers of a more continued kind. I mu&s;t, however confe&s;s, that, even in many of the&s;e, it is a remedy of great value. It &s;upports, in a very eminent degree, the tone and vigour of the powers of life.</P>
<P>Opium has been pre&s;cribed occa&s;ionally in fevers
<PB N="251" REF="028890_0260_0FDE60452C48DA60">
for a long time pa&s;t; but it is only of late years, that it has been recommended, as a general remedy in &s;ome particular &s;pecies of this di&s;ea&s;e. The practi|tioners of the We&s;t Indies, pre&s;cribe opium with more freedom, than is generally done in England. It is frequently employed to mitigate &s;ymptoms; and in &s;ome &s;ituations which were very alarming, I have given it in very large quantity with unexpected good effects. In the flow fevers of this country I have frequently had recour&s;e to it; and, combined with antimonials and camphire, have found it to be a re|medy, of great value. Opium in general was more cordial than wine. In ca&s;es of de&s;pondence and di&s;tre&s;s it gave a confidence to the mind, and im|parted a plea&s;ureablene&s;s to the &s;en&s;ations above all other remedies. In &s;hort, it appeared often, not only to be in&s;trumental in conducting the di&s;ea&s;e to a favourable termination, but it enabled the patient to pa&s;s through it with comfort to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I have mentioned in the preceding pages, the mo&s;t eminent of tho&s;e authors, who have written on the cure of fevers; giving at the &s;ame time &s;uch extracts from their works, that the reader, who has not the opportunity of con&s;ulting the originals, may be enabled to form &s;ome idea of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive changes, the improvements, and oftener perhaps the corrup|tions, which have ari&s;en in the method of treating febrile di&s;ea&s;es, from the earlie&s;t records of the art to the pre&s;ent times. The apparent changes are more numerous than the real ones; while the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite modes of treatment do not often appear to have much perceptible effect on the event. The cure of fever has been hitherto pur&s;ued on two gene|ral and oppo&s;ite views, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> on the idea of exciting the powers of life, by means of heating and &s;timulating remedies; or of dimini&s;hing the reaction of the &s;y&s;tem by evacuations and other antiphlogi&s;tic proce&s;&s;es. The above extremes of tho&s;e directly oppo&s;ite modes
<PB N="252" REF="028890_0261_0FDE5FB4B02E88A0">
of treatment have approached gradually to each other, or been variou&s;ly combined by different practitioners. It cannot however fail of appearing &s;trange to a per&s;on, who views the &s;cience of medicine in a philo|&s;ophical light, to hear one &s;et of men a&s;&s;erting that the proper cure of fever con&s;i&s;ts in exciting the powers of life, or in enabling nature to expel the di&s;|ea&s;e by force; while another, with no le&s;s confidence, maintains that the plan of moderating or dimini&s;hing increa&s;ed action is that which ought alone to be pur|&s;ued. From &s;uch contradictory a&s;&s;ertions we cannot ea&s;ily avoid concluding, either that the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite means produce the &s;ame effect, or that nature has a pre&s;cribed mode of proceeding in fevers, which ordi|nary medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance is not powerful enough to controul. There are many eminent practitioners, who have been con&s;cious of this truth. The candid Sydenham him&s;elf acknowledges, that tho&s;e, whom he treated with all his &s;kill and attention, and who po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed all the comforts that affluence could afford, did not often fare better than the poor, who were only &s;paringly furni&s;hed with nece&s;&s;aries, and who met with little a&s;&s;i&s;tance from medicine. I have my&s;elf &s;een many examples of the &s;ame kind. Sometimes I pur&s;ued the u&s;ual methods of cure with care and per&s;everance; &s;ometimes I left the bu&s;ine&s;s almo&s;t entirely to nature, and I cannot &s;ay, that the dif|ference of the event gives me much cau&s;e to be vain. But though I may appear to be &s;ceptical with regard to the effects of common practice, I &s;till cannot help being of opinion, that we may arrive at a high de|gree of perfection in the management of febrile di&s;|ea&s;es. So &s;anguine, indeed, are my expectations, that I cannot ea&s;ily forgive my&s;elf, when the event of this di&s;ea&s;e happens to be unfortunate. The remitting fever of Jamaica is not a di&s;ea&s;e by any means devoid of danger; yet I &s;hould not be &s;atisfied with my&s;elf, from the view which I now have of the &s;ubject, if I

lo&s;t one patient in fifty. I own indeed that this is a degree of &s;ucce&s;s, which neither I, nor perhaps any other man has yet attained. I mu&s;t however add, that I have not always had the liberty of doing what I wi&s;hed to do; neither have I always dared to ven|ture upon what I judged not proper to be done. The prejudices of patients in &s;ome ca&s;es, and the idea of re&s;pon&s;ibility in others, confine us to the beaten track, though we may be con&s;cious in our&s;elves that it never can lead us to our object. If the&s;e ob&s;tacles, were removed, a man who will act with deci&s;ion, may promi&s;e almo&s;t any degree of &s;ucce&s;s in the remitting fever of the We&s;t-Indies, in con&s;titutions which are free from habitual complaints.</P>
<P>The con&s;tant fluctuation which has hitherto pre|vailed in the opinions of phy&s;icians concerning the cau&s;es of fever, and in their practices with regard to its cure, oblige us to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> doubtfully of the real progre&s;s of the healing art. Hippocrates was allowed to have practi&s;ed with more &s;ucce&s;s than his prede|ce&s;&s;ors. A&s;clepiades was believed by many to have been &s;till more fortunate than Hippocrates; yet the road which he pur&s;ued was totally different. Galen, who reviewed and improved the &s;y&s;tem of the Coan &s;age, ro&s;e to great eminence, and marked out the path of medical practice for many centuries. The doc|trines of Paracel&s;us &s;hook his authority; and the&s;e in their turn gave way to newer modes of thinking. In this manner there have been &s;uch perpetual revolu|tions in the modes of treating febrile di&s;ea&s;es, that we can &s;carcely avoid concluding, that little or nothing of the matter is yet known with certainty. Medical writers have wandered from conjecture to conjecture, for more than two thou&s;and years; and we do not yet perceive any pro&s;pect of the&s;e conjectures being nearer to an end.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX. CONTAINING SOME HINTS WITH REGARD TO THE MEANS OF PRESERVING THE HEALTH OF SOLDIERS SERVING IN HOT CLIMATES.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING treated pretty fully of the remitting fever of Jamaica, and intermitting fever of America, I &s;hall now offer a few thoughts on the va|rious means of pre&s;erving the health of &s;oldiers in warm climates; taking the liberty at the &s;ame time to &s;ugge&s;t &s;ome ideas, which might perhaps be u&s;e|fully attended to by tho&s;e who &s;uperintend the medical e&s;tabli&s;hments of the army.</P>
<P>The climate of the We&s;t-Indies has been fatal to the European con&s;titution, even &s;ince its fir&s;t di&s;co|very by Columbus. To the armies and navies of England it has been particularly de&s;tructive. The &s;ad fate of the troops who went on the expedition to Carthagena will be long remembered; neither will the lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained at the Havannah, Martinique and Gaudaloupe &s;oon be forgotten; while the de&s;truction, occa&s;ioned by the effects of climate at St. Lucia, St. Juan, and even in Jamaica, during the late war, is &s;till fre&s;h in our memories. As it appears from a comparative view of the mortality of the troops em|ployed in the&s;e different &s;ervices, that we have pro|fited but little by the experience of our former mis|fortunes, it might probably be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the great &s;ickne&s;s, ob&s;erved on the&s;e occa&s;ions, has actu|ally ari&s;en from the irremediable effects of climate, or unavoidable hard&s;hips of &s;ervice in hot countries; but there is rea&s;on to believe that this is not wholly the ca&s;e. I will venture to a&s;&s;ert, nor &s;hould I ex|pect to meet with difficulty in proving, that much
<PB N="256" REF="028890_0264_0FDE5FC09B8CD758">
of it has proceeded from the inexperience or inatten|tion of tho&s;e who conducted the expeditions, or from &s;uch errors in the medical departments as might have been ea&s;ily obviated. It is &s;uperfluous to ob&s;erve, that the health of the &s;oldier is an object of principal importance in en&s;uring the &s;ucce&s;&s;es of war. We have many in&s;tances of expeditions apparently well concerted, which have failed from the exce&s;&s;ive &s;ick|ne&s;s of the troops: and too many proofs of this &s;ick|ne&s;s proceeding from a neglect of &s;uch precautions, as might have contributed to the pre&s;ervation of health. I have accu&s;tomed my&s;elf to look at this &s;ubject for more than fifteen years. I have turned it often in my mind, and cannot di&s;cover that much judicious attention has yet been paid to it. We can|not often perceive that health has been an object of con&s;ideration, in fixing the permanent &s;tations of troops; or that it has been much regarded in choo&s;ing encampments in the field. Exerci&s;es, which might inure the body to hard&s;hips, have not been &s;uffici|ently enforced; and &s;uch &s;orts of diet, and &s;uch modes of life, as might obviate the danger of di&s;ea&s;es, have been little attended to; while the be&s;t regulations for a &s;peedy and deci&s;ive plan of cure do not appear to have been adopted. I &s;hall be obliged, in tracing this &s;ubject, to advance &s;ome ideas which are contrary to the opinions of &s;ome celebrated authors, which combat popular prejudices, or which interfere with the views of intere&s;ted men. I may be reckoned pre|&s;umptuous perhaps in cen&s;uring freely; but I am con&s;cious that I do not advance any thing which has not truth for its foundation.</P>
<P>It has frequently been the practice, in times of war, to &s;end new rai&s;ed regiments to &s;erve in the i&s;lands of the We&s;t-Indies; and though the injudici|ou&s;ne&s;s of the practice has long been di&s;covered, it does not yet appear to be di&s;continued. During the late war there were &s;everal corps &s;ent out to tho&s;e
<PB N="257" REF="028890_0265_0FDE605234479B20">
countries newly recruited, the con&s;equence of which was, that though not a man died by the &s;word; yet in the &s;hort &s;pace of two years, there &s;carcely was a &s;oldier left. A great part of this dreadful mortality undoubtedly aro&s;e from the climate; yet &s;ome &s;hare of it &s;eems likewi&s;e to have proceeded from the par|ticular circum&s;tances of raw undi&s;ciplined troops.&mdash;Men newly enli&s;ted in England, are generally of gro&s;s and full habits, and too often accu&s;tomed to ir|regular and di&s;&s;ipated modes of life. Under &s;uch circum&s;tances, a &s;udden tran&s;ition to a hotter air, joined with full meals, and the habitual indolence of a pa&s;&s;age at &s;ea, cannot fail to produce a plethoric &s;tate of the body, which is often rendered dangerous by the incautious u&s;e of &s;trong liquors, or the ordi|nary exertions required in performing military exer|ci&s;es, under the influence of a powerful &s;un. I do not pretend to in&s;inuate that tho&s;e are the cau&s;es of remitting fever, but I am very &s;en&s;ible at the &s;ame time that they are cau&s;es which occa&s;ionally aggravate its danger, and which even &s;ometimes accelerate its appearance. In &s;oldiers who have been inured to a military life, &s;uch change of climate operates with dimini&s;hed effect. The bulk of the fluids is per|haps dimini&s;hed by a continuance of le&s;s full living; while the tone and ela&s;ticity of the moving powers are increa&s;ed by habits of exerci&s;e and exertion.&mdash;The di&s;po&s;ition to commit exce&s;&s;es is likewi&s;e repre&s;|&s;ed by the rigour of di&s;cipline; and the mind acquires a philo&s;ophical firmne&s;s from long &s;ervice, which not only contributes to the pre&s;ervation of health, but which enables the individual to &s;u&s;tain with fortitude the attack of di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>In pa&s;&s;ing from a cold to a hot climate, the fir&s;t thing that occurs to be con&s;idered, is the effect pro|duced by the &s;imple increa&s;e of heat on the human frame. Expan&s;ion of the fluids, and con&s;equent ful|ne&s;s of the ve&s;&s;els is con&s;tantly ob&s;erved to take place
<PB N="258" REF="028890_0266_0FDE5FC6EE060738">
from &s;uch a change, frequently however accompanied with dimini&s;hed energy of the moving powers, par|ticularly where heat is combined with dampne&s;s of the air. To obviate therefore this natural effect of heat is the fir&s;t general object to be attended to, in tran&s;porting troops to the tropical climates. The Engli&s;h, from the con&s;titution of their bodies, and &s;till more perhaps from their manner of living, &s;uffer more from tho&s;e &s;udden changes than &s;ome other European nations. The French and Spaniards are not only le&s;s gro&s;s con&s;titutionally, but eat likewi&s;e le&s;s animal food, and drink their liquors greatly more diluted, than the natives of England. They do not probably owe more to medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance than the Engli&s;h; yet they are known to e&s;cape better from dangerous di&s;ea&s;es; and their &s;afety I might add has been remarked to bear &s;ome proportion to the differ|ent degrees of ab&s;temiou&s;ne&s;s, which they are known to ob&s;erve. An idea prevails with the generality of people, who vi&s;it warmer or more unhealthy climates, that it is nece&s;&s;ary to eat and drink freely, as a &s;ecu|rity again&s;t the attacks of endemic fevers; but a very narrow ob&s;ervation will &s;erve to &s;hew, that good living, as it is called, has no &s;uch effects; and we may even &s;oon perceive, unle&s;s blended by long e&s;tabli&s;hed prejudices which flatter our appetites, that it actually is attended with pernicious con&s;e|quences. The mo&s;t ab&s;temious, &s;o far as I have ob|&s;erved, e&s;caped the be&s;t, not only from the attacks, but particularly from the danger of di&s;ea&s;es. With regard to the diet of a &s;oldier, &s;erving in a hot cli|mate, I &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed to believe, that one &s;pare meal of animal food would be perfectly &s;ufficient in twenty-fours: and if it were ea&s;y to alter e&s;tabli&s;hed cu&s;toms, it would be mo&s;t proper, perhaps, that it were made in the cool of the evening. Coffee, or tea for breakfa&s;t might likewi&s;e be &s;ub&s;tituted with ad|vantage in place of the ordinary allowance of rum:
<PB N="259" REF="028890_0267_0FDE605878104F68">
but this I mu&s;t confe&s;s would be a dangerous expe|riment, Our &s;oldiers have been &s;o long accu&s;tomed to con&s;ider this gratuitous allowance of rum as their right, that no man could an&s;wer for the con&s;equences of with-holding it. The practice certainly is perni|cious, and the man, who fir&s;t introduced it into the army, did no good &s;ervice to his country. I do not deny that a judicious u&s;e of &s;pirits might be of benefit occa&s;ionally: neither do I pretend to &s;ay, that, even the harde&s;t drinking can be con&s;idered as a general cau&s;e of fevers; but it would not be difficult to pro|duce evidence, that hard drinking aggravates the violence, and increa&s;es the danger of the di&s;ea&s;e, when it happens to take place; while I cannot perceive much rea&s;on for concluding, that the u&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors has ever been productive of general good to the army, particularly in warm climates. But as I have ju&s;t mentioned, that &s;pirituous liquors have little claim to be con&s;idered among the number of tho&s;e things, which contribute to the pre&s;ervation of health: &s;o I may add, with perfect confidence, that the allow|ance of rum granted to &s;oldiers, has done much harm by ruining di&s;cipline, and good behaviour. If it is with-held for one day, di&s;content immediately begins to &s;hew it&s;elf among the men. If with-held for any length of time, complaints &s;ometimes ri&s;e to a &s;tate of mutiny, and de&s;ertions become numerous. But be&s;ides this, that &s;oldiers &s;eldom perform extra-duty with alacrity, unle&s;s they are bribed with a double allowance of liquor. A double allowance, drank un|diluted, as is generally the ca&s;e, is frequently &s;uffi|cient to produce &s;ome degree of intoxication. I need not mention the di&s;a&s;ters to which an intoxicated army is expo&s;ed. Di&s;a&s;ters of a very &s;erious nature have actually happened from this cau&s;e, and they might have happened oftener had the enemy been always vigilant, and bold enough to have &s;eized the opportunity.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="028890_0268_0FDE5FCC4F6544D8">
A deal might be &s;aid on the &s;ubject of ab&s;temiou&s;|ne&s;s. Moderation both in eating and drinking is e&s;|&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to the health of troops newly ar|rived in hot climates; but a truth &s;o obvious need not be enforced by many arguments. The example of the French and Spaniards afford a very convinc|ing one. It is known to every medical per&s;on, that the fevers of hot climates are generally mo&s;t danger|ous in full and plethoric habits. It ought to be an object of attention therefore to obviate this cau&s;e of mortality, by means of &s;pare living, and the cautious u&s;e of &s;timulating liquors: but &s;oldiers have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ittle &s;elf command, and &s;eldom re&s;i&s;t the gratification of their appetites. Hence it becomes the duty of their offi|cers to enforce their compliance with what is proper, and to preclude them, as much as is po&s;&s;ible, from the means of obtaining what is pernicious; but this re|quires great vigilance and attention, and often great &s;everity. It is not enough that &s;oldiers are obliged to eat in me&s;&s;es. The officers ought daily to in&s;pect their meals, and inflict penalties where they ob&s;erve tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions. And further, as it is a matter of much importance to pre&s;erve troops in a &s;tate of health fit for action, and as the cour&s;e of fevers is often un|commonly rapid in the We&s;t-Indies, it would be pro|per, perhaps, that the &s;urgeon reviewed the men daily. The di&s;tant approach off the di&s;ea&s;e would be fre|quently di&s;covered by this means, and the danger of it might probably be &s;ometimes averted by timely a&s;|&s;i&s;tance. Before men appear in the &s;ick-reports, the fever is often con&s;iderably advanced in its progre&s;s.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the alterations which might be made in the diet of troops, on their arrival in hot climates, &s;ome changes in the mode of cloathing might, perhaps, be likewi&s;e adopted for the &s;ake of ea&s;e and convenience, if not for purpo&s;es of real u&s;e and economy. Round white hats would be the mo&s;t proper covering for the head; and dowlas might be &s;ub&s;tituted with advan|tage
<PB N="261" REF="028890_0269_0FDE605E0ED36900">
in room of the thick cloth, of which the coats of &s;oldiers are u&s;ually made. There can be no grounds for &s;uppo&s;ing, that a &s;oldier will not fight as well in dowlas as in &s;carlet; and there is certain proof that he will perform duties, which require exertion, with greater &s;afety and effect, as the nature of his cloathing will pre|&s;erve him cooler by &s;ome degrees. But though &s;uch al|terations may be hinted, there is little room to believe that they will be attended to. In the pre&s;ent rage for military &s;hew, it will be a difficult ta&s;k to con|vince men to lay a&s;ide an uniform, which adds &s;o much to the brilliancy of the appearance. Much &s;tre&s;s &s;eems at pre&s;ent to be laid upon the dre&s;s of the &s;oldier, and I do not pretend to argue, that it is a matter of perfect indifference. It has certainly very often had vi&s;ible effects upon the enemy; but the&s;e effects have oftener proceeded from a knowledge of the character of the troops who wore it, than from any thing formidable in the uniform it&s;elf. But to leave this &s;ubject of dre&s;s, I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that a flannel or cotten wrapper would be more u&s;e|ful to a &s;oldier, &s;erving in the We&s;t-Indies, than a blanket; and perhaps the expence of it would not be much greater. It would &s;erve for his covering in the night, and would &s;ecure him again&s;t the effects of cold, where occa&s;ions obliged him to go out.</P>
<P>I &s;hall endeavour in the next place to point out &s;ome of tho&s;e benefits, which may be derived to health, from habits of daily exerci&s;e. This is an object of the greate&s;t importance, but unfortunately it is an object very little attended to in the Briti&s;h army. It appears, indeed, to be little regarded in mo&s;t of the armies of modern Europe. I &s;hould incur a charge of pre&s;umption, perhaps of ignorance, did I attempt to point out the exerci&s;es which are the mo&s;t proper for the forming of &s;oldiers. Tho&s;e only which contri|bute to the pre&s;ervation of health, belong to this place. I may however remark, that the e&s;&s;ential part of the
<PB N="262" REF="028890_0270_0FDE5FD32AF4BFF8">
art of di&s;ciplining troops, con&s;i&s;ts in imparting &s;enti|ments of heroi&s;m and virtue to the minds of the men, in improving the exertions of their limbs, and in &s;u&s;tain|ing knowledge of the corre&s;pondence of their exer|tions when called into action. If I dur&s;t take &s;o great a liberty, I &s;hould be inclined to &s;ay, that our ordinary exerci&s;es are flat and in&s;ipid in their nature; that they occa&s;ion no exertions, and excite no emulation: they neither improve the active powers of the body, nor inure the &s;oldier to bear fatigue and hard&s;hip. The Romans, who owed more to the di&s;cipline of their armies than any nation on earth, were extremely ri|gorous and per&s;evering in their exerci&s;es. They prac|ti&s;ed their &s;oldiers in every &s;pecies of &s;ervice that might occur; &s;o that nothing at any time happened wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> which they were unacquainted. Actual war was in reality a time of relaxation and amu&s;ement to the &s;oldiers of this warlike people, who appear to have been trained for the &s;ervice of the field, as hor&s;es are for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">nting or the cour&s;e. The Romans were not only &s;en&s;ible of the advantages which tho&s;e habits of exerci&s;e procured them in action; but had al&s;o the penetration to di&s;cover, that they were emmently &s;er|viceable in the pre&s;ervation of health. The words of Vegetius are remarkable. "R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">i militari<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> periti, plus quatidiana <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">morum exercilia ad &s;anitatem mili|tum putaverunt prod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;e, quam medicos." I made the &s;ame remark during the time that I attended a regi|ment in America, without knowing that it was &s;up|ported by &s;o great authority. I ob&s;erved, when the men were in the field, &s;ometimes even complaining of hard&s;hip and fatigue, that few were reported in the li&s;t of the &s;ick: when removed to quarters, or en|camped for any length of time in one place, the ho&s;|pital was ob&s;erved to fill rapidly. This ob&s;ervation was uniformly verified, as often as the experiment was repeated.</P>
<P>An idea has been long entertained, that the Euro|ropean
<PB N="263" REF="028890_0271_0FDE6063D23D7EA0">
con&s;titution cannot bear hard labour in the &s;un, or perform military exerci&s;es with &s;afety, in the hot climates of the We&s;t-Indies. Hence a plan has been &s;ugge&s;ted, and in &s;ome degree I believe adopted, that regiments &s;erving in tho&s;e countries, he furni&s;hed with people of colour to do the drudgery of the &s;ol|diers. But this appears to be an innovation which ought to be admitted with extreme caution. It will evidently &s;erve to increa&s;e &s;loth and idlene&s;s, and un|le&s;s the per&s;ons of colour can perform the military duty in the field, their &s;ervices will go but a &s;hort way in pre&s;erving the health of the troops. A &s;ol|dier, notwith&s;tanding he may have received the King's pay for twenty years or more, remains in &s;ome de|gree a tyro till his body has been inured to fatigue, and prepared to bear without danger the effects of the climate, in which he may be de&s;tined to &s;erve. This is a part of the military di&s;cipline, indeed, no le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary than a knowledge of the u&s;e of arms, and though it is a part of it, difficult to be accom|pli&s;hed, there is &s;till room to believe, that it may be effected, even in the &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> dreaded climate of Ja|maica. It is a common opinion, that the fatigues of an active campaign in the We&s;t-Indies, would be fatal to the health of the troops; but the opinion has been a&s;&s;umed without fair trial. The exertions of a &s;ingle day have often been hurtful. This was fre|quently the ca&s;e in America, where the &s;oldiers had remained for &s;ome time in a &s;tate of re&s;t; but bad effects from the greate&s;t exertions, in the hotte&s;t weather of &s;ummer, were extremely rare in that country, after the campaign had been continued for a few days. But that I may not &s;eem to re&s;t an opi|nion of &s;o great importance on a bare analogy, I &s;hall beg leave to ob&s;erve, that young European planters undergo greater fatigues, and remain daily expo&s;ed for a longer time to the heat of the &s;un, than would fall to the lot of &s;oldiers in the actual &s;ervice of the
<PB N="264" REF="028890_0272_0FDE5FD9C561EE00">
field. I might likewi&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> confirm the opinion, that an Engli&s;hman is capable or &s;u&s;taining fatigue in the We&s;t-Indies, equally well with the African, or the native of the i&s;lands, by mentioning a journey which I once performed my&s;elf. I lived about four years in Jamaica, during the greate&s;t part of which I believed that death, or dangerous &s;ickne&s;s, would be the con&s;equence of walking any di&s;tance on foot; but I afterwards learnt that this apprehen&s;ion was vain. I left Savanna la Mar in the year 1778, with the de&s;ign of going to America; but having em|barked in a hurry, and forgot a material piece of bu&s;ine&s;s, I found a nece&s;&s;ity of being put a&s;hore, after having been two or three days at &s;ea. I was landed at Port Morant, in St. Thomas's in the Ea&s;t, from which I went to King&s;ton by water, where learning that there was a ve&s;&s;el at Lucca, in the We&s;tern ex|tremity of the i&s;land, nearly ready to &s;ail for New-York, I &s;et out directly, that I might not lo&s;e the opportunity of a pa&s;&s;age. My finances not being in a condition to furni&s;h hor&s;es, I left King&s;ton on foot, about twelve o'clock, and accompli&s;hed a journey before it was dark of eighteen miles. I did not find I was materially fatigued and &s;till per&s;i&s;ting in my re&s;olution, travelled a hundred miles more in the &s;pace of the three following days. It may not be im|proper to remark, that I carried baggage with me, equal in weight to the common knap&s;ack of a &s;oldier. I do not know that &s;o great a journey was ever per|formed on foot by an European, in any of the i&s;lands of the We&s;t-Indies; not &s;o much I am convinced from inability, as from idea that &s;uch exertions are dangerous. But as it appears from the above fact, that the European con&s;titution is capable of &s;u&s;tain|ing common military fatigues in the climate of Ja|maica; &s;o I may add that it ought to be a principal object of military di&s;cipline, that &s;oldiers be practi&s;ed with frequent marching, and the performance of
<PB N="265" REF="028890_0273_0FDE606A6D95C4F0">
other exerci&s;es of exertion, if it is actually meant that they &s;hould be u&s;eful in times of war. The fate of battles, I might ob&s;erve, depends oftener on rapid movements, in which the activity of the limbs is concerned, than on the expert handling of arms, which is acquired by the practice of the manual. I ob&s;erved formerly, that ab&s;temiou&s;ne&s;s and temperance were among the be&s;t means of pre&s;erving health, or obviating the danger of the di&s;ea&s;es to which troops are liable on their fir&s;t arrival in hot climates; but the rules of temperance are little regarded by Engli&s;h &s;oldiers at any time, and almo&s;t con&s;tantly tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed wherever extraordinary labour is required of them. To &s;uch cau&s;es of exce&s;s, joined with the great heat of the &s;un, we may perhaps impute many of the bad effects of marching, or of moderate fatigue in the We&s;t-Indies. In the journey which I have ju&s;t now mentioned, I probably owe my e&s;cape from &s;ick|ne&s;s to temperance and &s;pare living. I breakfa&s;ted on tea about ten in the morning, and made a meal of bread and &s;allad, after I had taken up my lodging for the night. If I had occa&s;ion to drink through the day, water or lemonade was my beverage. In the year 1782, I walked between Edinburgh and London in eleven days and a half; and invariably ob&s;erved, that I performed my journey with greater ea&s;e and plea&s;ure, where I drank water, aud only breakfa&s;ted and &s;upped, than when I made three meals a day, and drank wine, ale, or porter. In the fol|lowing &s;ummer I carried the experiment farther. During the months of July and Augu&s;t, I travelled in &s;ome of the hotte&s;t provinces of France. I ge|nerally walked from twenty-five to thirty miles a day, in a degree of heat le&s;s &s;upportable than the common heat of Jamaica, without &s;uffering any material in|convenience. I breakfa&s;ted about ten o'clock on tea, coffee or &s;yrup of vinegar, made a &s;lender meal of animal food in the evening, with a great proportion
<PB N="266" REF="028890_0274_0FDE5FDF4B5250C0">
of &s;allad and vegetables; but never drank the weake&s;t wines without dilution. The great refre&s;hment which I found from &s;yrup of vinegar and water, con|vinces me, that the Romans had good cau&s;e for mak|ing vinegar &s;uch an e&s;&s;ential article among the pro|vi&s;ions of their armies.&mdash;The &s;tate of luxury and our depraved appetites, unfortunately do not &s;uffer it to be adopted by the Engli&s;h. I ought perhaps to make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> apology to the reader for introducing my own experience on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion: but I mu&s;t add, that I have only done it, becau&s;e it enables me to &s;peak from conviction, that an Engli&s;h &s;oldier may be rendered capable of going through the &s;evere&s;t military &s;ervice in the hotte&s;t i&s;lands of the We&s;t-Indies, and that temperance will be one of the be&s;t means of enabling him to perform his duty with &s;afety and effect.</P>
<P>I mentioned before, that the military exerci&s;e of the Engli&s;h army is ill calculated to excite a &s;pirit of emulation among the men. It is in fact con&s;idered only as a piece of drudgery, in which there are few who have any ambition to excel. It has little effect in improving the activity of the limbs, or hardening the con&s;titution of the body; &s;o that it may better &s;u&s;tain hard&s;hip and fatigue. But feeble as its effects are in the view of increa&s;ing exertion, or pre&s;erving health, it is generally almo&s;t intirely di&s;continued when troops arrive in hot climates; a practice, which has ari&s;en from a &s;uperficial and mi&s;taken view of the &s;ubject. Sloth and indolence are the bane of a &s;ol|dier in every climate; exerci&s;e and action are the greate&s;t pre&s;ervatives of di&s;cipline and of health. It would be reckoned pre&s;umption in me, and it does not belong to this place to point out tho&s;e exerci&s;es which might be proper for the forming of &s;oldiers. But every one knows that walking, running, wre&s;t|ling, leaping, fencing and &s;wimming, are often called into actual u&s;e in the practice of war. The&s;e are
<PB N="267" REF="028890_0275_0FDE6070ED953850">
&s;uch exerci&s;es likewi&s;e as excite emulation, and are practi&s;ed with plea&s;ure by the individual. They harden the body, increa&s;e the power of the limbs, and by furni&s;hing the officer with a view of the different degrees of activity, may often enable him to place his men in the ranks, according to the uniformity of their exertions; a more u&s;eful mode of arrangement in time of action, than uniformity of exterior form. I may add in this place, that &s;ea-bathing will be ex|tremely u&s;eful in mo&s;t ca&s;es, in increa&s;ing the vigour and pre&s;erving the health of &s;oldiers &s;erving in warm climates. There no doubt will occur many ca&s;es, in which it is improper; but in general it may be employed with great benefit. I chiefly impute it to this cau&s;e, that I did not experience a &s;ingle day's indi&s;po&s;ition, during the four years that I lived in Jamaica.</P>
<P>It has been known for many ages, that the cau&s;e of intermitting and remitting fevers, the mo&s;t for|midable di&s;ea&s;es of hot climates, owes its origin to exhalations from &s;wampy and moi&s;t grounds. It often happens likewi&s;e, that tho&s;e low and &s;wampy grounds are the mo&s;t acce&s;&s;ible parts of a coa&s;t or that towns and &s;ettlements have been placed near them&mdash;to at|tack or defend which falls to the lot of the &s;oldier. It not being therefore in the power of a military commander to remove the natural di&s;advantages, which I have mentioned; it is only in his power to &s;hew his judgment and attention, by applying the be&s;t remedies to obviate their effects. It is certainly an object of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to pre&s;erve troops in a &s;tate of health fit for action: and no per&s;on will deny, that every care ought to be employed in choo&s;ing the be&s;t &s;ituations for quarters, or even temporary encampments, that the nature of the duty will permit. We learn from experience that fevers are little known in rough and hilly countries, where water flows with a rapid cour&s;e; while we likewi&s;e
<PB N="268" REF="028890_0276_0FDE5FE502AFF530">
know, that they are common in low and champaign countries, where water &s;tagnates, or has only a &s;luggi&s;h motion: independent of which, tho&s;e &s;itua|tions which are in the neighbourhood of &s;wamps, or near the oozy banks of large rivers, have always been ob&s;erved to be particularly liable to &s;uch di&s;ea&s;es. If therefore the circum&s;tances of the &s;ervice do not for|bid, no room can be left to doubt about the propriety of &s;tationing troops in the mountanous or hilly parts of a country; while I may likewi&s;e add, that where nece&s;&s;ity confines them to the plain, the &s;ea &s;hore will in general be found to be the mo&s;t eligible. But be&s;ides the above general character of local &s;ituations there are likewi&s;e &s;ome &s;ubordinate circum&s;tances, which de&s;erve to be particularly attended to in choo&s;ing the ground of encampments. It is very commonly believed that high and elevated &s;ituations are the mo&s;t uniformly proper for this purpo&s;e; but this in fact is not, by any means, a general rule. A high and dry &s;ituation does not contain any thing hurtful in it&s;elf; but it is more than others expo&s;ed to the effluvia which are carried from a di&s;tance. It is the peculiar nature of exhalations to a&s;cend as they proceed from their &s;ource; in confirmation of which truth I have had &s;everal opportunities of witne&s;&s;ing, that this cau&s;e of di&s;ea&s;e was carried to ri&s;ing grounds in a &s;tate of great activity; while it apparently pa&s;&s;ed over the plain or vallies which lay contiguous, without pro|ducing any material effects. From the knowledge of this fact we are furni&s;hed with this obvious re|mark, that it will be proper to interpo&s;e woods or ri&s;ing grounds to the progre&s;s of tho&s;e noxious va|pours; or where &s;uch natural advantages do not exi&s;t, it might be &s;erviceable to burn a chain of fires in a temporary encampment, or even to rai&s;e a parapet wall to over top the barracks, where nece&s;&s;ity re|quires a more permanent &s;tation.&mdash;It would be a matter of utility, could we determine with any cer|tainty
<PB N="269" REF="028890_0277_0FDE6076E7B88C70">
to what di&s;tance from its &s;ource, the noxious effluvia extend; but this is a que&s;tion which we can|not hope to a&s;certain very exactly. It is not uni|formly the &s;ame in all &s;ituations, depending on the concentrated &s;tate of the exhalation at its &s;ource, the ob&s;tacles it meets with in its progre&s;s, and the nature of the ground over which it pa&s;&s;es, or to which it is directed. I have known its influence very remark|able at the di&s;tance of a mile and a half, on the top of a hill of very con&s;iderable elevation.</P>
<P>The conveniences of trade have often tempted co|loni&s;ts to place their towns on the banks of rivers, without regard to the healthfulne&s;s of the &s;ituation.&mdash;The choice of &s;uch &s;pots, injudicious as it evidently is, has been greatly approved of, and warmly recom|mended as preferable to others for the encampment of troops, by a very celebrated medical authority. Sir John Pringle con&s;iders the banks of large rivers as extremely proper for this purpo&s;e, on account of a free circulation of air; but I am &s;orry to ob&s;erve, that Sir John Pringle's opinion on this occa&s;ion appears to have ari&s;en from his theory, rather than that his theory has ari&s;en from ob&s;ervation. We have actual experience of the unhealthfulne&s;s of the muddy banks of large rivers in hot climates; and we have little cau&s;e to dread di&s;ea&s;es, which originate from confined air in America, the We&s;t-Indies, or perhaps in any country where troops are employed in the field.</P>
<P>I have ju&s;t now ob&s;erved, that the banks of large rivers, in the opinion of Sir John Pringle, afford the mo&s;t eligible &s;ituation with re&s;pect to healthine&s;s for the encampment of troops. I may add, that the &s;ame author has likewi&s;e recommended open grounds, for this purpo&s;e, in preference to woods; and that the &s;ame favourite idea, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> a free circulation of air, has influenced his advice. I will not contend, that open, dry and cultivated grounds may not be prefer|able to grounds covered with wood, where the heat
<PB N="270" REF="028890_0278_0FDE5FEB2AA00C60">
of the climate is moderate; but I have no doubt in a&s;&s;erting, that encampments on lands, the woods of which have been newly cut down, as is generally the ca&s;e in times of war, are of all others the mo&s;t un|healthful. I have my&s;elf &s;een &s;everal examples of it. Perhaps it is in a great mea&s;ure owing to this cau&s;e, that new countries are generally &s;o fatal to the fir&s;t &s;ettlers; as al&s;o, that troops &s;uffer &s;o remarkably in carrying on the &s;ieges of places which are &s;urrounded by woods: it being con&s;tantly ob&s;erved, that effluvia from moi&s;t lands, when fir&s;t expo&s;ed to the action of a powerful &s;un, are always highly pernicious. The Romans, who&s;e ob&s;ervations on &s;ubjects which relate to war, may be oppo&s;ed with confidence to the authority of the mo&s;t celebrated moderns, were fully &s;en&s;ible of the advantages of encamping under the &s;helter of wood. We learn from Vegetius, that their armies re&s;orted to the cover of a wood, not le&s;s carefully, than that they avoided the vicinity of &s;wamps or mar&s;hes. There are in reality various circum|&s;tances, which contribute to render &s;uch &s;ituations both healthy and agreeable. If troops are encamped in the body of a wood, the noxious effluvia, which may be carried by the winds from neighbouring &s;wamps, are &s;topt in their progre&s;s; the lofty &s;hade of the trees pre&s;erves the air cool and more refre&s;h|ing than the atmo&s;phere of the open country; while we know from experience, that moi&s;t and &s;wampy lands do not &s;end forth their noxious vapours, in any re|markable degree, unle&s;s where they are acted upon by the heat of a powerful &s;un.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only further ob&s;erve, with regard to the cau&s;e of intermitting and remitting fevers, that a &s;pace of time almo&s;t con&s;tantly intervenes between expo&s;ure to the noxious effluvia, and the &s;ub&s;equent appearance of the di&s;ea&s;e. It is not indeed uniformly the &s;ame in all ca&s;es, appearing to depend not only on the concentrated &s;tate in which the exhalation is
<PB N="271" REF="028890_0279_0FDE607C7B527660">
applied to the body; but on the general aptitude of the individual, and the various occa&s;ional or exciting cau&s;es, which facilitate or re&s;i&s;t its operation. It was in a few in&s;tances only, that I &s;aw the di&s;ea&s;e appear before the &s;eventh day. It was oftener the fourteenth, twentieth, or even longer. Upon the whole I may remark, that &s;eptenary periods has a con&s;iderable power in influencing the time of its appearance.</P>
<P>Having offered a few ob&s;ervations in the preced|ing pages, on the diet, exerci&s;es and choice of the quarters or encampments for troops in hot climates; I &s;hall now add a few hints re&s;pecting medical care and management. It will probably be &s;uppo&s;ed, that no attention with re&s;pect to this &s;ubject has been omitted. Regiments are provided with &s;urgeons, and armies have always been furni&s;hed with ample ho&s;|pital e&s;tabli&s;hments. But this perhaps is not enough. It is nece&s;&s;ary that the duties of the&s;e &s;tations be well executed, as well as well de&s;igned. The office of &s;urgeon to a regiment is an office of tru&s;t and of pri|mary importance; the appointment to it, however, does not &s;eem in general to be &s;ufficiently attended to. The &s;urgeoncies of regiments, till lately, were allowed to be bought and &s;old; in con&s;equence of which abu&s;e, little other qualification, came to be re|quired, than the command of the purcha&s;e money. Thus it often happened, that young men, who had attended a cour&s;e of anatomical lectures, or walked the rounds of an ho&s;pital for a few months, came at once to be entru&s;ted with the care of the lives of &s;ix or &s;even hundred &s;oldiers, who, as they are rai&s;ed and maintained at a great expence, de&s;erve, on the &s;core of economy, independent of every other con&s;ideration, to be well taken care of. It would be &s;uperfluous to u&s;e any arguments to prove the prodigality of committing the care of a regiment to men, who have not had profe&s;&s;ional experience in any country, and who are totally unacquainted with the di&s;ea&s;es of the countries
<PB N="272" REF="028890_0280_0FDE5FF1BA658A08">
to which they are frequently &s;ent. If we are di&s;po&s;ed to believe that there is any thing in medical treatment, we can &s;carcely avoid making the conclu&s;ion, that many lives are lo&s;t from this cau&s;e. It mu&s;t not be under&s;tood, that I mean any thing dire&s;pectful to the &s;urgeons of the army, by this in&s;inuation. I know that a regiment is an excellent &s;chool for medical knowledge; and that the be&s;t practitioners have occa|&s;ionally appeared in the army; but I wi&s;h &s;trongly to inculcate the propriety of obliging candidates for this office, to produce evidence of their qualifications, be|fore they are admitted to &s;uch an important tru&s;t. It is not enough, that a young man, who offers him&s;elf to take charge of the health of a regiment, &s;hould know to perform an operation with dexterity. Hand|ling a knife in reality is the lea&s;t part of a regimental &s;urgeon's duty. The office of phy&s;ician is his daily employment, to execute which properly, both years and experience are required. It certainly ought there|fore to be an object of concern with tho&s;e who are entru&s;ted with the office of &s;uperintending the medi|cal appointments of the army, that the candidates for &s;urgeoncies be obliged to &s;ubmit to &s;uch trials, as may in &s;ome degree afford proofs of their abilities. It would be a proper regulation, perhaps, that no man be permitted to propo&s;e him&s;elf for the &s;urgeoncy of a regiment, before he has arrived at &s;uch an age, as may have furni&s;hed him with general experience; and further, that he give te&s;timony of actual abilities by the treatment of di&s;ea&s;es in an ho&s;pital, under the in&s;pection of an able phy&s;ician, to whom the duty will be pre&s;cribed to examine the mode of practice with rigour. A trial of this &s;ort might be better tru&s;ted to than the recommendatory letter of a profe&s;&s;or; or even the diploma of Oxford or Edinburgh. There is not any thing chimerical in the propo&s;al. Nothing in &s;hort is more practicable; but it is &s;carcely to be expected, that men of talents and education will give
<PB N="273" REF="028890_0281_0FDD22946CFCC4F8">
them&s;elves &s;o much trouble, that they may be admit|ted into a &s;ervice which holds out few advantages. The &s;alary of regimental &s;urgeons is &s;mall; and it is per|haps no paradox to &s;ay, that this is a cau&s;e of great expence to the nation. The bare &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, which the &s;ervice affords, furni&s;hes no inducement for men of abilities to enter, at lea&s;t to remain any length of time in the army, which unfortunately has been con|&s;idered in no other light, than as a place, where &s;ur|geons may pa&s;s their noviciate; but which they are generally di&s;po&s;ed to leave, as &s;oon as they are quali|fied to execute the duty properly. Medical know|ledge is gained only by experience but independent of medical knowledge, an acquaintance with the ha|bits, characters and di&s;po&s;itions of &s;oldiers is a matter of &s;o great importance, that old &s;urgeons, even of in|ferior abilities as medical men, have generally been ob&s;erved to have a proportionably &s;mall li&s;t of &s;ick in their re&s;pective corps. The qualities that are principal|ly required in a regimental &s;urgeon, exclu&s;ive of medi|cal learning and knowledge, are acutene&s;s in di&s;cern|ing the characters and di&s;po&s;itions of men, and above all, boldne&s;s and deci&s;ion in the application of reme|dies. Life is often lo&s;t in unhealthy climates, by the dilatorine&s;s and timidity of common practice.</P>
<P>Having mentioned ju&s;t now, that there appears to be a remi&s;&s;ne&s;s in examining the qualifications that are requi&s;ite for the office of regimental &s;urgeon, I might perhaps, with equal ju&s;tice, extend the re|mark to the appointments in the general ho&s;pital.&mdash;The power of appointing phy&s;icians or &s;urgeons in the ho&s;pital, has generally been lodged with the com|manders in chief, and I might &s;ay, without tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ing the bounds of truth, that merit has not always been the be&s;t claim for promotion. It would be in|vidious to be more particular in cen&s;uring what is pa&s;&s;ed. It is only hoped, that the &s;ubject will be en|quired into, and &s;uch remedies applied, as will pre|clude
<PB N="274" REF="028890_0282_0FDE5FF8B80366B8">
&s;imilar abu&s;es in future. The general ho&s;pital has ever been a heavy article in the expences of war; and if it were fair to form an opinion of the whole, from the part which I have &s;een, I &s;hould not he&s;i|tate in declaring, that the e&s;tabli&s;hment is in a great mea&s;ure &s;uperfluous. I have no doubt, in obtaining the &s;uffrages of people of experience, that general ho&s;pitals are ruinous to military di&s;cipline; that they promote &s;loth and indolence, the wor&s;t di&s;ea&s;e to which a &s;oldier is liable, and that they extingui&s;h very &s;peedily the ardour for the &s;ervice of the field.&mdash;There is in fact no exaggeration in the a&s;&s;ertion, that the man, who has &s;pent two or three months in a ge|neral ho&s;pital, is le&s;s of a &s;oldier than when he was fir&s;t recruited. It is only I may add by habits of ex|erci&s;e, even by toils and fatigue, that men at la&s;t at|tain the properties of good &s;oldiers: while it is only by con&s;tant practice of &s;uch di&s;cipline, that they are pre&s;erved in a &s;tate fit for the performance of their duties. The&s;e active qualities are &s;peedily extin|gui&s;hed by the habits of &s;loth and indolence, which prevail in general ho&s;pitals; but be&s;ides this, it is likewi&s;e certain, that cures are often there protracted to months, which might have been accompli&s;hed in the cour&s;e of a few days, if circum&s;tances would have permitted the men to remain with their regiments.&mdash;Regimental &s;urgeons have many inducements to exert them&s;elves in re&s;toring their men &s;peedily to health, which act only with feeble power on tho&s;e who have the management of general ho&s;pitals. The former likewi&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ome advantages, of which the latter are de&s;titute. They know the habit and di&s;po&s;itions of the patient; they &s;ee the di&s;ea&s;e in its fir&s;t begin|nings, and are enabled to &s;eize the mo&s;t favourable moments for acting with deci&s;ion. The above are con&s;iderations, which ought to make us backward in removing &s;ick &s;oldiers to general ho&s;pitals; I may add, that &s;uch is the nature of military di&s;ea&s;es, that
<PB N="275" REF="028890_0283_0FDD2297884BD338">
there does not, perhaps occur one ca&s;e in twenty, which might not be treated properly by the &s;urgeon of the regiment, if attention, and a very little expence were be&s;towed in providing nece&s;&s;ary accommodation. But be&s;ides that, the di&s;ea&s;es of &s;oldiers are &s;eldom of &s;uch a kind, that they might not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> properly by regimental &s;urgeons, if government were at the expence of &s;upplying a few conveniencies.</P>
<P>I may farther ob&s;erve, that together with the in|dolence naturally attached to general ho&s;pitals, and uniformly hurtful to military di&s;cipline, there is often actual danger to life, by removing men in critical &s;ituations, or by the nece&s;&s;ary intermi&s;&s;ion of medi|cal a&s;&s;i&s;tance, where continual and vigorous exer|tions are required The di&s;ea&s;es of hot climates, particularly the fevers of the We&s;t-Indies, are often mo&s;t acute and rapid in their cour&s;e. The &s;ur|geon of a regiment perceives the approach of danger, and, &s;en&s;ible that his &s;ituation does not enable him to do ju&s;tice to his patient, determines to remove him to the general ho&s;pital. But time is lo&s;t before this can be accompli&s;hed. It is &s;eldom that any thing is done after it is deemed proper to &s;end a &s;ick man away; neither does it commonly happen, that any thing material is attempted on the day on which he is received. Thus one day at lea&s;t, &s;ometimes two are completely lo&s;t in ca&s;es, where every moment is of con&s;equence. Time is precious in the fevers of hot climates; and the deci&s;ion or neglect of an hour often determines the fate of a patient.</P>
<P>It is an ob&s;ervation, which cannot fail of having frequently occurred to people who have &s;erved any time in the army, that it would be a very great ad|vantage to the &s;ervice, if &s;ick &s;oldiers could always be taken care of by the re&s;pective &s;urgeons of the regiment. I have endeavoured to &s;hew, that the plan is practicable and ea&s;y; and I may further add, that the expence nece&s;&s;ary for &s;uch an arrangement,
<PB N="276" REF="028890_0284_0FDE5FFE64E586B0">
would not amount to one third of what is u&s;ually &s;pent in general ho&s;pital e&s;tabli&s;hments. If this idea were adopted, nothing more would be required, than that proper lodgings, proper provi&s;ions, and a &s;uffi|cient &s;upply of medicines, were furni&s;hed for the &s;ick; that the &s;urgeon of the regiment be well qua|lified for his &s;tation; and that an in&s;pector be ap|pointed for a certain portion of troops, to take care that the duty be well and diligently executed. By this means a general ho&s;pital, as far as regards me|dical treatment, might be aboli&s;hed, or at lea&s;t greatly abridged. Where fighting was expected, extra-&s;ur|gical a&s;&s;i&s;tance would &s;till be nece&s;&s;ary. Such an in&s;pection of regimental ho&s;pitals, as that I have men|tioned, &s;eems to be perfectly &s;ufficient for the care of the health of an army, in ordinary occa&s;ions. The greate&s;t precautions, however, ought to be taken, that the in&s;pection does not degenerate into a nominal duty. The in&s;pector ought to vi&s;it the different quarters, examine minutely into every article of the management of the ho&s;pitals, and order that general reports be publi&s;hed annually; and that &s;ome mark of approbation be be&s;towed upon tho&s;e &s;urgeons, who appear to have executed their duty with the greate&s;t diligence and ability. It ought to be a concern of government, however, that no per&s;on be appointed to in&s;pect regimental ho&s;pitals, who is not well ac|quainted with the di&s;ea&s;es of the climate, in which the troops happen to &s;erve.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH I have de&s;cribed the endemic fever of Jamaica as di&s;tinctly as is in my power; yet as I have often ob&s;erved that we attain more ac|curate ideas from the detail of a particular hi&s;tory than from general de&s;cription, I &s;hall &s;elect from my notes two or three ca&s;es which may &s;erve to give a clearer view of the different &s;pecies of the di&s;ea&s;e. And in the fir&s;t place I &s;hall de&s;cribe an in&s;tance of fever, which was di&s;tingui&s;hed through the whole of its cour&s;e by &s;ymptoms of the general inflammatory diathe&s;is.</P>
<P N="1">(1) Lennox, a &s;oldier of the 60th regiment, aged 40, of a firm and compact habit of body, was &s;eized on the 3d of December, between eight and nine in the morning, with a &s;light horror or &s;hivering, pre|ceded and accompanied by other u&s;ual marks of fever. The &s;ymptoms of coldne&s;s and &s;hivering went off in the cour&s;e of eight or ten minutes. A hot fit &s;uc|ceeded, with a good deal of head-ach, hurried re&s;pi|ration, con&s;iderable thir&s;t, a &s;trong, full, and frequent pul&s;e. After a continuance of four or five hours, &s;weat began to appear on the head and brea&s;t, which extending gradually to the extremities brought with it a tolerable di&s;tinct remi&s;&s;ion of the fever. 2. The fever appeared to be gone off very completely by ten o'clock at night. The patient re&s;ted well during
<PB N="2" REF="028890_0286_0FDE6002E79EB728">
the night, and continued in this &s;ame &s;tate of ea&s;e till about five o'clock in the evening. He then became unea&s;y and re&s;tle&s;s, with head-ach and a &s;light feveri&s;h heat. 5. The feveri&s;h indi&s;po&s;ition declined in the cour&s;e of the night. He became ea&s;ier towards morn|ing, and about &s;even might be &s;aid to be in a &s;tate of remi&s;&s;ion. About nine a paroxy&s;m commenced, &s;imi|lar to the paroxy&s;m of the fir&s;t day, though with a &s;till &s;lighter degree of horror and &s;hivering; the hot fit ran &s;till higher, with much head-ach, thir&s;t, and a &s;trong vigorous pul&s;e. The &s;weating at la&s;t made its appearance, and the violence of the fever declined: there &s;till however remained &s;ome degree of head-ach, pain of the back, and thir&s;t, with an aver&s;ion to food, and a more than natural frequency of pul&s;e. 6. Re&s;ted tolerably; but &s;till is not free from head-ach and pain of the back: the tongue is dry and foul, and the coat which covers it is &s;mooth, but of con&s;i|derable thickne&s;s, and of a cream colour. About four in the evening the paroxy&s;m of a fever made its appearance, &s;imilar, in &s;ome degree, to the paroxy&s;m of the fourth, but of a much greater degree of vio|lence. It continued for eight hours, and declined gradually towards morning. 7. There were no per|ceivable marks of fever at &s;even in the morning. A little after nine, however, a paroxy&s;m commenced, &s;imilar, in every re&s;pect, to the paroxy&s;m of the fifth. 8. About three in the afternoon a paroxy&s;m began &s;imilar to the paroxy&s;m of the &s;ixth, but &s;till more violent. It declined after the u&s;ual duration, and was &s;ucceeded on the ninth by another paroxy&s;m &s;imilar to that of the &s;eventh. The remi&s;&s;ion which &s;ucceeded appeared to be &s;till more perfect than any of the preceding; the &s;weat was even more copious, and the pul&s;e became &s;ofter and more expanded after it than it had hitherto done. 10. A paroxy&s;m re|turned about half pa&s;t two, &s;imilar to the paroxy&s;m of the eighth, but not le&s;s violent in degree. It termi|nated,

however, in a more fluid and univer&s;al &s;weat; the pul&s;e and the &s;tate of the &s;kin returned perfectly to what they were in health; the mucous coat &s;epa|rated from the tongue; the eye and countenance a&s;|&s;umed their natural &s;erenity, and unequivocal marks of final cri&s;is appeared on the morning of the eleventh. The above ca&s;e is an in&s;tance of the double tertian; the fever of the even day terminated the di&s;ea&s;e; and the pul&s;e through the whole cour&s;e was vigorous and &s;trong, or marks of inflammatory diathe&s;is, in a mo|derate degree, were con&s;tantly pre&s;ent.</P>
<P N="2">(2) Henley, a &s;oldier of the 60th regiment, was &s;eized on the 6th of May, about five in the evening, with a nau&s;ea, or unplea&s;ant affection at &s;tomach, marks of great languor and debility, a &s;light feeling of coldne&s;s and horror, a very weak and frequent pul&s;e, head-ach, pain of the back, and other &s;ymp|toms which are u&s;ual in the acce&s;&s;ion of fevers. After a continuance of ten or twelve hours, the&s;e &s;ymptoms were &s;o far gone off, that the patient was con&s;idered to be in a &s;tate of remi&s;&s;ion. 7. The exacerbation of the fever returned again about the &s;ame hour in the evening at which it had fir&s;t come on, though without marks of preceding coldne&s;s or &s;hivering. The pul&s;e was &s;mall, ob&s;cure, and extremely frequent; the heat of the body was not increa&s;ed very mate|rially; the thir&s;t was only in a moderate degree, but there was much nau&s;ea, an aver&s;ion to food, a di&s;po|&s;ition to faint in an erect po&s;ture, deep and heavy &s;ighing, tremor of the tongue, and a &s;ad and de&s;pond|ing &s;tate of the eye and countenance. 8. The &s;ymp|toms of fever abated towards morning, and a remi&s;|&s;ion, though by no means a di&s;tinct one, took place. The pul&s;e became &s;omewhat &s;lower and more ex|panded; the &s;ighing and anxiety abated a little, and there was evidently a &s;tate of greater ea&s;e; though there &s;till remained marks of great debility, and &s;igns
<PB N="4" REF="028890_0288_0FDE6009843BA610">
of &s;pa&s;modic &s;tricture on the &s;urface of the body. The heat was lower than it u&s;ually is in health. About five in the evening the &s;ymptoms, which had prevailed in the former paroxy&s;ms, returned again, but with con&s;iderable aggravation. The head was affected with delirium, and there was a con&s;iderable degree of tremor and &s;tarting. 9. Ea&s;ier in the morning, though the remi&s;&s;ion was in no degree more complete than the former. About the u&s;ual hour in the even|ing the &s;ame &s;ymptoms returned with aggravation. 10. The remi&s;&s;ion as the former; the heat of the body below natural; the pul&s;e ob&s;cure and frequent; the &s;igns of debility very great. The exacerbation returned again at the u&s;ual hour; the paroxy&s;m ap|peared to be &s;omewhat more violent; the delirium was higher, the heat greater, and the pul&s;e acquired rather more &s;trength and fulne&s;s. 11. Ea&s;ier in the morning, with a remi&s;&s;ion in every re&s;pect as complete as the former; the pul&s;e di&s;tinct, and rather more ex|panded; and, upon the whole, an appearance of rather more vigour. The paroxy&s;m was renewed in the evening as u&s;ual. 12. Remi&s;&s;ion in the morning rather more complete: more vigour in the pul&s;e. The exacerbation as u&s;ual. 13. In the morning, in&s;tead of the u&s;ual remi&s;&s;ion, there appeared marks of a complete and final cri&s;is; the &s;ighing, which had been trouble&s;ome throughout the cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, vani&s;hed; the eye and countenance a&s;&s;umed their u&s;ual &s;erenity and cheerfulne&s;s, the pul&s;e be|came &s;lower, &s;ofter, and more expanded; and the tongue parted with its coat or covering. The above is an in&s;tance of fever with &s;ymptoms of ner|vous affection.</P>
<P N="3">(3) Sergeant Negli, on the 2d of November, about eight in the morning, was &s;eized with horror, &s;hivering, and other Symptoms, which are u&s;ual in the acce&s;&s;ion of fevers. The not fix did not run very

high, and before evening the paroxy&s;m was con&s;i|derably abated. 3. This patient is now in the &s;tate of remi&s;&s;ion, the heat of the body is not greater than natural; but the ca&s;e &s;eems to be attended with &s;ome &s;ymptoms which are not very common in the fevers of this country. The countenance is clouded, dark, and grim; the appearance of the eye is &s;ad and de&s;ponding; and he expre&s;&s;es an unea&s;ine&s;s in his feelings which is not ea&s;ily accounted for. 4. The paroxy&s;m returned about four in the morning. It was greatly more violent than the preceding; and though it might be &s;aid to remit very completely, if we judge by the heat of the body and &s;tate of the pul&s;e; yet there &s;till remained &s;ome uncommon and unplea&s;ant feelings. The eye and countenance were not only dark and de&s;ponding, but the tongue was covered with a &s;limy mucous coat, through which the red &s;urface appeared ob&s;curely; there were &s;trange and unaccountable twitchings of the &s;tomach and bowels, di&s;turbed &s;leep, frightful dreams, and fore|boding apprehen&s;ions. 5. A paroxy&s;m came on this evening near twelve hours &s;ooner than it was ex|pected. After expre&s;&s;ing an ea&s;ine&s;s at &s;tomach, and throwing up &s;ome matter of a dark colour, he was &s;uddenly &s;eized with a &s;tupor and in&s;en&s;ibility, from which he could not be rou&s;ed by all the applications of art. He died in about &s;ixteen hours. This ca&s;e affords an in&s;tance of fever with marks of a peculiar malignity. The appearances of danger were &s;udden and unexpected; and, as it was among the fir&s;t in|&s;tances of the kind which I had &s;een, I was di&s;ap|pointed, and in &s;ome degree confounded at the event.</P>
<P N="4">(4) Thom&s;on a young man aged twenty, after more than u&s;ual exerci&s;e in the heat of the &s;un, was &s;eized with &s;ickne&s;s, &s;hiverings, and other &s;igns of fever, about nine o'clock in the morning of the 3d of February. The pul&s;e was hard, frequent, and
<PB N="6" REF="028890_0290_0FDE600F1B26B6D0">
irritated; the eye was &s;ad, and &s;ometimes gli&s;tening; the countenance flu&s;hed, but rather dark and over|ca&s;t; the re&s;piration hurried; nau&s;ea was trouble&s;ome, with a good deal of anxiety and re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s. The paroxy&s;m continued long, and did not indeed go off very perfectly at la&s;t. 4. Re&s;ted but indifferently; is now &s;omewhat ea&s;ier, though the remi&s;&s;ion is far from being perfect; the thir&s;t is con&s;iderable; the tongue dry and foul, the &s;tomach loathes all &s;orts of food; and he &s;eems to be much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed with flatus and ructus; the &s;tools are dark-coloured and foetid; the pul&s;e is more frequent than natural, hard and ir|ritated, and the &s;kin is only partially moi&s;t. 5. An exacerbation of fever happened about nine in the morning. The &s;ymptoms were of the &s;ame kind as in the fir&s;t paroxy&s;m, only &s;omewhat more violent in degree. The anxiety at &s;tomach was particularly di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, and there appeared &s;till more evident marks of putre&s;cent tendency in the alimentary canal, 6. An unea&s;y night: an imperfect and ob&s;cure remi&s;&s;ion; the gums redder than they naturally are: the eye has a gli&s;tening appearance, and the countenance is &s;till confu&s;ed and clouded: the tongue is dry; the thir&s;t great; and ructus and flatus are very di&s;tre&s;&s;ing: the pul&s;e &s;till irritated and quick: there is not any very remarkable di&s;po&s;ition to faint in an erect po&s;|ture: the &s;tools foetid. 7. The exacerbation returned about the &s;ame hour as on the fifth, and with &s;till greater aggravation: the &s;ymptoms of di&s;tre&s;s in the &s;tomach and bowels were particularly alarming; with nau&s;ea, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">idoro&s;e belchings, and large watery foetid &s;tools. 8. Somewhat ea&s;ier in the morning, though the remi&s;&s;ion can only be &s;aid to be ob&s;cure. 9. The exacerbation happened at the &s;ame hour as on the &s;eventh, and continued for nearly the &s;ame length of time. 10. In&s;tead of ob&s;cure remi&s;&s;ion, marks of final cri&s;is are now evident; the pul&s;e is returned nearly to its natural &s;tate; the eye and

The above is an in&s;tance of fever, in which there were very evident &s;igns of pu|tre&s;cent tendency in the alimentary canal; even &s;ome ob&s;cure marks of its progre&s;s in the general &s;y&s;tem, complicated, however, with an irritated &s;tate of the va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem, or &s;uch &s;ymptoms as might be con|&s;idered as belonging to the apparent inflammatory diathe&s;is.</P>
<P N="6">(6) Cunningham, a &s;ailor, aged twenty-five, was &s;eized on the 5th of July, about five in the evening, with &s;ickne&s;s, &s;hiverings, head-ach, and the other u&s;ual &s;igns of the remitting fever of the country. Its more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;ymptoms were nau&s;ea and vomiting. 6. The remi&s;&s;ion is tolerably di&s;tinct; but there is &s;till a good deal of head-ach, thir&s;t, and &s;igns of debility; the tongue is dry, and the pul&s;e is more frequent than natural. The paroxy&s;m returned about five in the evening with increa&s;ed vio|lence, accompanied with &s;evere retching, and copious vomiting of bilious matter. 7. Better in the morn|ing; the vomiting has cea&s;ed, and the remi&s;&s;ion is tolerably di&s;tinct. The exacerbation returned at the u&s;ual hour, with the &s;ame di&s;tingui&s;hing &s;ymp|toms of copious bilious di&s;charges. 8. Remi&s;&s;ion in the morning as u&s;ual; the exacerbation in the even|ing as the preceding, with di&s;tre&s;&s;ing and &s;evere vo|miting. 9. The u&s;ual remi&s;&s;ion in the morning. The paroxy&s;m likewi&s;e recurred in the evening about the u&s;ual time, but not with the u&s;ual &s;ymptoms. In&s;tead of vomiting of bilious matters, there was &s;ome degree of delirium, tremors, &s;tartings, and other &s;ymptoms of nervous affection. 10. The&s;e &s;ymptoms remitted in the morning, but there &s;till
<PB N="8" REF="028890_0292_0FDE60150122C580">
remained &s;igns of great irritability and weakne&s;s. The &s;ame train of &s;ymptoms returned again in the evening: the delirium and tremors were &s;till in a higher degree; the pul&s;e was &s;mall and frequent; and there was occa&s;ionally a great di&s;po&s;ition to faint in an erect po&s;ture. 11. Better in the morning, though there are not yet any marks of cri&s;is. The exacerbation returned again in the evening, with &s;ymptoms &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the preceding paroxy&s;m. 12. Remi&s;&s;ion in the morning &s;imilar to the former. Exacerbation in the evening rather more violent. 13.

A bli&s;|ter was applied to the back of the head and neck, with a bolus of camphire, opium, and valerian. Wine was ordered, together with the bark, as &s;oon as the remi&s;&s;ion &s;hould begin to appear. This plan was per&s;i&s;ted in till the cri&s;is arrived, which was on the 13th.</P>

<P N="1">1. As the cold bathing, which I have &s;o &s;trongly recommended in the cure of fevers, has an exterior appearance of being a ra&s;h and hazardous remedy, I &s;hall relate &s;ome ca&s;es which may enable the reader to judge more preci&s;ely of its real effects. Cold-bath|ing I may remark, appears to have been occa&s;ionally employed by the Greek and Roman phy&s;icians, after the time of the Emperor Augu&s;tus; but I was only a young man when I went out to the We&s;t-Indies, and cannot pretend to &s;ay that I was acquainted with the writings of tho&s;e phy&s;icians, or that I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed much knowledge of di&s;ea&s;es, except the little that could be retained from a cur&s;ory hearing of univer&s;ity lectures. The fir&s;t hints of this practice were there|fore accidental, and aro&s;e from a conver&s;ation I had with the ma&s;ter of the ve&s;&s;el, in which I went pa&s;|&s;enger. This per&s;on commanded a tran&s;port in the war 1756, and was pre&s;ent at the &s;iege of the Ha|vannah. As he was talking one day of the &s;tate of the fleet, he mentioned accidently, that &s;ome men were &s;ent aboard of his &s;hip ill of fevers; &s;everal of whom, he ob&s;erved, jumped into the &s;ea during the dilirium which attended the paroxy&s;ms of the di&s;ea&s;e. Some of them, as might be expected, were drowned; but the mo&s;t part of tho&s;e who were recovered from the waves appeared to be greatly benefited by the ducking. The fact, which, from the veracity of the man, I thought I could depend upon, &s;truck me &s;trongly, and I re&s;olved, in my own mind, to bring it to the te&s;t of experiment as &s;oon as an opportunity &s;hould offer: neither was it long after my arrival in Jamaica, that I had occa&s;ion to vi&s;it a &s;ailor who&s;e &s;ituation &s;eemed to ju&s;tify &s;uch a trial. The poor
<PB N="12" REF="028890_0296_0FDE620C788E0318">
man was aboard of a &s;hip, which lay at anchor about a mile from the &s;hore. He had been ill two days; the delirium <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">; his eyes were red and inflam|ed; his re&s;piration was hurried; he was anxious and re&s;tle&s;s in a high degree, whil&s;t together with tho&s;e marks of excitement, he was occa&s;ionally languid and di&s;po&s;ed to faint. His &s;kin being dirty furni&s;hed an o&s;ten&s;ible excu&s;e for trying this remedy. But it was previou&s;ly thought proper to draw &s;ome blood from the arm; which being done, &s;ome buckets of &s;alt water were da&s;hed on the &s;houlders. He was now laid in bed: a copious &s;weat en&s;ued, &s;ucceeded by a di&s;tinct remi&s;&s;ion, and a total change in the nature of the &s;ymptoms. The &s;ucce&s;s I met with in this in|&s;tance was more than I had expected; I was there|fore encouraged to try the &s;ame mode of bathing in a per&s;on who came under my care &s;ome weeks there|after, and who had been ill of a fever &s;ix or &s;even days. This patient had been bled and bli&s;tered;&mdash;emetics and cathartics had been likewi&s;e employed, and bark had been given in the u&s;ual manner, for the three la&s;t days. The fever, however, had now in a great mea&s;ure lo&s;t its type. The man was low and languid; his eyes were dim; his vi&s;ion indi&s;tinct;&mdash;his pul&s;e was &s;mall and frequent, and, when the head was rai&s;ed from the pillow, not to be felt. Though it did not appear that he could rea&s;onably be expected to live long, I &s;till wi&s;hed to get him conveyed to the deck, that a trial might be made of the effects of cold bathing; but the &s;ituation was &s;o tickli&s;h, that I felt &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s in &s;etting about it. At la&s;t he was lifted through the hatch-way in a blanket, though I mu&s;t confe&s;s that I was not without apprehen&s;ions that he might die under my hands. Some wine was then poured down his throat; and he was &s;prinkled with cold &s;alt water, as he lay on the deck. Ap|pearing to be &s;omewhat invigorated by this proce&s;s, he was rai&s;ed up very gently, and &s;everal buckets of
<PB N="13" REF="028890_0297_0FDD22A371B00050">
the &s;ea-water were da&s;hed about his head and &s;houl|ders. He was then laid in bed; the pul&s;e &s;oon became large and full. I left him in a copious &s;weat, and was agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed next day to find him &s;itting on the deck, to which he had walked on his own feet. I &s;hall only mention another in&s;tance of the good ef|fects of cold bathing in the fevers of the We&s;t-Indies, which is perhaps more deci&s;ive than either of the for|mer. A boy, aged fourteen, had been ill of a fever &s;even or eight days. Nothing had been omitted, in point of treatment, which is u&s;ual to be done in &s;imi|lar ca&s;es. Bark and wine had been carried as far as could be &s;erviceable, or even &s;afe; yet death &s;eemed to be approaching fa&s;t. The &s;ucce&s;s of cold bathing, in &s;ome in&s;tances &s;imilar to the pre&s;ent, &s;o far ex|ceeded my expectation that I was induced to make trial of it in the ca&s;e before me, though I was not altogether without apprehen&s;ions that death might be the con&s;equence of the attempt. The bu&s;ine&s;s, how|ever, was accompli&s;hed without accident; and next day the boy was able, not only to &s;it up in bed, but even to walk over the floor. After in&s;tances &s;o unequivocal as the above, it would be &s;uperfluous to mention any others. I &s;hall only add, that I have tried the remedy, in various &s;ituations, always with &s;afety, generally with a&s;toni&s;hing &s;ucce&s;s; &s;o that I cannot forbear recommending it even at an early pe|riod, in the fevers of the We&s;t-Indies. It commu|nicates tone and vigour to the powers of life, and di|mini&s;hes irritability in a degree far &s;uperior to all other cordials or &s;edatives. The bathing was managed in the following manner: the water, which was re|quired to be of a refre&s;hing degree of coolne&s;s, was generally da&s;hed by means of a bucket on the head and &s;houlders. It was likewi&s;e found that its good effects were heightened, in &s;ome ca&s;es, by previous bleeding, and by the previous u&s;e of warm bathing. This may &s;eem a ra&s;h practice to tho&s;e who argue
<PB N="14" REF="028890_0298_0FDD22A4F8260218">
without experience; but, &s;etting a&s;ide the authority of the ancients, we find it confirmed by the example of a per&s;on who was not a phy&s;ician, and who, there|fore may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be le&s;s under the influence of a favourite opinion from which he might be led to di&s;gui&s;e the truth. Bu&s;bequius, who was &s;ent on an emba&s;&s;y to Soliman the Great, was obliged to travel to Ama&s;ia, where the Sultan then &s;ojourned. In his return home he was &s;eized with a continued fever, and very &s;everely harra&s;&s;ed by it. The di&s;ea&s;e gained &s;o much ground during the journey, that he found it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;top at Con&s;tantinople to attend to the recovery of his health. The practice which was adopted to effect this may appear to be &s;ingular, and by many, perhaps, will be thought to be hazardous and ra&s;h. He mentions, that, after enjoying the luxury of warm bathing, he was &s;uddenly &s;prinkled with cold water. His words are, "Idem, &s;cilicet, Quaquelbenus me a balneo exeuntem frigida perfun|debat, quae res et&s;i erat mole&s;ta, tamen magnope<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> juvabat." (Iter. Con&s;tant. p.) His phy&s;ician, Qua|quelbenus, who &s;eems to have been a man of excel|lent judgment and careful ob&s;ervation, had probably learnt the practice in his travels in A&s;ia, as it does not appear to have been commonly known in Europe at that time.</P>

<P N="1">1. But be&s;ides the&s;e te&s;timonies of phy&s;icians, in favour of the practice of drenching with cold water, the memoirs of Baron Trenck furni&s;h us with a cu|rious and very convincing proof of the efficacy of this remedy, in extingui&s;hing, almo&s;t like a charm, the violence of a burning fever. The Baron, when ill of a fever in the pri&s;on at Madgeborough, unfortu|nately broke the pitcher which contained his daily allowance of water. The fever was violent, and he &s;uffered the mo&s;t inexpre&s;&s;ible torments of thir&s;t, for the &s;pace of twenty-four hours. When the u&s;ual &s;upply was brought to him next day, he &s;eized the pitcher with eagerne&s;s, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">d drank the water with &s;uch a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">dity, and in &s;o great quantity as is &s;carcely cre|dible. The con&s;equence was a total removal of the di&s;ea&s;e. To this I might add an in&s;tance, which hap|pened to my&s;elf at Savanna in Georgia, in the year 1779. In the exce&s;&s;ive hot weather of the month of July, I was &s;eized with the endemic of the country, in a more violent degree than was commonly &s;een. In the third paroxy&s;m of the di&s;ea&s;e, my de&s;ire for cold water was ravenous. A pitcher of it was drawn from the pump, which I drank off in&s;tantly without the lea&s;t abatement of the thir&s;t. The draught was repeated in a few minutes, in quantity not le&s;s than a quart. The thir&s;t was effectually quenched, and the fever &s;eemed to vani&s;h. But though the fever appeared to be extingui&s;hed as it were by a charm; yet the &s;tomach and hypochondria became di&s;tended, yellowne&s;s of the eye and countenance &s;ucceeded, with a con&s;iderable degree of debility which remained for two or three days. I mu&s;t, however, remark with regard to this ca&s;e, that the effects were not the &s;ame as they have been u&s;ually reported to be by
<PB N="16" REF="028890_0300_0FDE60A1EF5D07D0">
authors. The fever was extingui&s;hed; but neither vomiting, &s;weat, or any other &s;en&s;ible evacuation en&s;ued. The ancients, I may further ob&s;erve, &s;eem to have admini&s;tered cold drink only in the advanced &s;tate of fever, when &s;igns of coction began to ap|pear; in which ca&s;e, it is impo&s;&s;ible to form a certain opinion of its preci&s;e &s;ucce&s;s. That cold water may be employed with effect, it is nece&s;&s;ary that the thir&s;t be inten&s;e, perhaps that it be purpo&s;ely provoked, and that it be fully and complete<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y &s;atiated. If managed in this manner, it probably will not often fail of extin|gui&s;hing the fever; yet I mu&s;t not omit to mention, that unle&s;s it is managed with a great deal of caution and judgment, it may al&s;o often irrecoverably extin|gui&s;h the powers of life.</P>
<P N="2">2. In &s;upport of this opinion, I &s;hall mention a ca&s;e, which fell under my own ob&s;ervation about a twelvemonth ago. I was called to a young man, a &s;ailor, ill of a fever of a very dangerous and alarming kind. It was the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> day of the di&s;ea&s;e before I &s;aw him. He had not been hitherto in the lea&s;t be|nefited by any thing that was tried; neither did any remedy which I could think of, though employed with almo&s;t de&s;perate boldne&s;s, in any degree check the progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e. The power of &s;peech was lo&s;t, and even &s;wallowing was performed with difficulty; the eye was languid, nay almo&s;t without motion; the countenance was gha&s;tly; and many livid &s;pots, &s;ome of them nearly the &s;ize of a &s;ix-pence, made their appearance on different parts of the body. I propo&s;ed bathing, and the friends of the young man, con&s;idering the &s;ituation as de&s;perate, con&s;ented that I &s;hould make a trial of it; more, perhaps, to comply with my de&s;ire, than from expectation of any benefit that might re&s;ult from it. But in &s;etting about it, it unfortunately happened, that an uten&s;il proper for the purpo&s;e could not be procured, &s;o that
<PB N="17" REF="028890_0301_0FDE60A881FACA48">
we were compelled to be contented with a general fomentation. This was applied in as complete a manner as circum&s;tances would permit. A blanket was &s;oaked in warm &s;alt water, and the body was wrapped in it from head to foot. In a &s;hort time the &s;kin became &s;oft and warm, &s;weat began to flow; the eye and countenance began to re&s;ume their anima|tion, which had been almo&s;t extingui&s;hed, the pul&s;e ro&s;e; &s;wallowing was performed with le&s;s difficulty; and next day the colour of the &s;pots was evidently brighter. So far the change was favourable; but a regular &s;upply of wine and cordials having been ne|glected during the following night, the pul&s;e &s;unk, and things returned nearly to their former &s;ituation. The fomentation was again repeated, in con&s;equence of which the extremities and &s;urface of the &s;kin be|came warm and moi&s;t, an effect which was no &s;ooner produced, than the blanket was &s;uddenly removed, and the face and brea&s;t, particularly, were &s;prinkled with cold water, in which a large portion of &s;alt was di&s;&s;olved. The cold had the effect to cau&s;e the patient to &s;hrink at the fir&s;t, yet in a &s;hort time he appeared to be refre&s;hed very remarkably. The powers of life grew gradually &s;tronger; though the marks of cri&s;is were not very evident for &s;everal days. To the above I might add &s;ome other in&s;tances, where effects were &s;imilar; but I avoid &s;welling the notes to too great extent, by entering into particular details. I &s;hall therefore only ob&s;erve in general, that cold bathing was u&s;ually of &s;ervice. It imparted general tone and vigour to the powers of life, and by increa&s;|ing the activity of the va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem, probably &s;ometimes rendered the cri&s;is complete, where it na|turally would not have been &s;o; but I cannot venture to &s;ay that I ever carried it &s;o far that the di&s;ea&s;e could be &s;aid to be precipitately extingui&s;hed by it.</P>

<HEAD>NOTES TO THE CHAPTER UPON YELLOW FEVER.</HEAD>
<P>(<HI>a</HI>) IN compliance with the language of medical authors, I have de&s;cribed the following di&s;ea&s;e under the name of Yellow Fever, though I am per|fectly &s;en&s;ible, that the appellation is not by any means proper. There are &s;ome in&s;tances of the di&s;ea&s;e perhaps where yellowne&s;s does not at all appear, and in no one does it ordinarily &s;hew it&s;elf till the latter &s;tages. I know al&s;o that mo&s;t of the practi|tioners of Jamaica con&s;ider it only as an aggravated &s;pecies of the remittent; the common endemic of hot climates. It appeared to me I mu&s;t confe&s;s in a dif|ferent light; but I &s;hall attempt to de&s;cribe the two di&s;ea&s;es accurately, and leave it to the reader to judge for him&s;elf. It may not however be improper in this place to take notice of the opinion of Dr. Mo&s;eley. Dr. Mo&s;eley has lately written a treati&s;e on this di&s;ea&s;e, and endeavoured to per&s;uade us that it is no other than the <GAP DESC="foreign"> or ardent fever of the ancients. But the yellow fever of the We&s;t-Indies, by Dr. Mo&s;eley's own confe&s;&s;ion, is in &s;ome manner peculiar to &s;trangers newly arrived in tropical climates. The <GAP DESC="foreign"> we are informed, made its appearance in the i&s;lands of the Archipelago, and on the coa&s;ts of the contiguous continents indi&s;criminately among men and women,
<PB N="19" REF="028890_0303_0FDE60B473EFE9E8">
natives or foreigners: in fact it has not, as far as I can perceive, any claim to be con&s;idered as a di&s;tinct &s;pecies of di&s;ea&s;e. If I rightly under&s;tand the &s;pirit of Hippocrates, or the de&s;cription of the &s;till more accurate Aretaeus, <GAP DESC="foreign"> in reality is only an acci|dental condition of the common endemic of the coun|try, where the force of the fever is chiefly exerted upon the &s;tomach and alimentary canal. In this manner it appears frequently in Jamaica, and in the &s;outhern provinces of America. In the hot months of &s;ummer, it appears occa&s;ionally in every climate: and is not nece&s;&s;arily accompanied with, nor does it depend upon a general inflammatory diathe&s;is of the &s;y&s;tem for its exi&s;tence.</P>
<P N="6">6. Authors &s;eem generally to have attributed the black colour of the vomitings ob&s;erved in this di&s;ea&s;e to blood effu&s;ed into the cavity of the &s;tomach; but the fal&s;ity of this opinion is &s;ufficiently proved by the appearances which are ob&s;erved on di&s;&s;ection.</P>
