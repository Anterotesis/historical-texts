<OPENER>Humbly &s;heweth,</OPENER>
<P>THAT with the Numbers of People the Number of Lunaticks, or Per+&s;ons di&s;temper'd in Mind, and deprived of their rational Faculties, hat greatly encrea&s;ed in this Province.</P>
<P>THAT &s;ome of them going at large, are a Terror to their Neighbours, who are daily apprehen&s;ive of the Violences they may commit; and others are continually wa&s;ting their Sub&s;tance, to the great Injury of them&s;elves and Families, ill di&s;po&s;ed Per&s;ons wickedly taking Advantage of their unhappy Condition, and drawing them into unrea&s;onable Bargains, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>THAT few or none of them are &s;o &s;en&s;ible of their Condition as to &s;ubmit volun|tarily to the Treatment their re&s;pective Ca&s;es require, and therefore continue in the &s;ame deplorable State during their Lives; whereas it has been found, by the Ex|perience of many Years, that above two Thirds of the mad People received into <HI>Bethlehem</HI> Ho&s;pital, and there treated properly, have been perfectly cured.</P>
<P>YOUR Petitioners beg Leave farther to repre&s;ent, that tho' the good Laws of this Province have made many compa&s;&s;ionate and charitable Provi&s;ions for the Re|lief of the Poor, yet &s;omething farther &s;eems wanting in Favour of &s;uch who&s;e Poverty is made mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> mi&s;erable by the additional Weight of a grievous Di&s;ea&s;e, from which they might ea&s;ily be relieved, if they were not &s;ituated at too great a Di&s;tance from regular Advice and A&s;&s;i&s;tance, whereby many langui&s;h out their Lives, tortur'd perhaps with the Stone, devour'd by the Cancer, depriv'd of Sight by Cataracts, or gradually decaying by loath&s;ome Di&s;tempers; who, if the Ex|pence in the pre&s;ent Manner of nur&s;ing and attending them &s;eparately when they come to Town, were not &s;o di&s;couraging, might again, by the judicious A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Phy&s;ick and Surgery, be enabled to ta&s;te the Ble&s;&s;ings of Health, and be made in a few Weeks u&s;eful Members of the Community, able to provide for them&s;elves and Families.</P>
<P>THE kind Care our A&s;&s;emblies have heretofore taken for the Relief of &s;ick and di&s;temper'd Strangers, by providing a Place for their Reception and Accommoda|tion, leaves us no Room to doubt their &s;hewing an equal tender Concern for the Inhabitants. And we hope they will be of Opinion with us, that a &s;mall Provincial Ho&s;pital, erected and put under proper Regulations, in the Care of Per&s;ons to be appointed by this Hou&s;e, or otherwi&s;e, as they &s;hall think meet, with Power to re|ceive and apply the charitable Benefactions of good People towards enlarging and &s;upporting the &s;ame, and &s;ome other Provi&s;ions in a Law for the Purpo&s;es above|mentioned, will be a good Work, acceptable to GOD, and to all the good People they repre&s;ent.</P>

<SALUTE><HI>E&s;teemed Friends,</HI> Thomas Hyam, <HI>and</HI> Silvanus Bevan,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Opinion we have of your beneficent Principles, induces us to make this Application to you, and we hope the Opportunity of exerting your Ten|derne&s;s to the Afflicted and Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, will be &s;o acceptable, as to render any Apo|logy unnece&s;&s;ary for our Freedom in reque&s;ting your Friend&s;hip in delivering and &s;ol|liciting the Addre&s;s we herewith &s;end to our Proprietaries, THOMAS and RICHARD PENN.</P>
<P>THE Circum&s;tances of this Province have, in a few Years pa&s;t, been much al|ter'd, by the Addition of a great Number of Per&s;ons who arrive here from &s;everal Parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> many of whom are poor, and &s;ettle in remote Parts of the Coun|try, where &s;uitable Provi&s;ion cannot be made for their Relief from the various Di&s;|orders of Body and Mind &s;ome of them labour under; the Con&s;ideration of which hath lately rais'd in many of the Inhabitants of this City a benevolent Concern, and engaged them to apply for the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Legi&s;lature, by whom a Law is pa&s;|&s;ed, and &s;ome Provi&s;ion made out of the Provincial Trea&s;ury for the Erecting a publick Ho&s;pital or Infirmary, under the Direction of a Corporation, by whom we have lately been elected the Managers; but as the publick Funds are not &s;ufficient to an&s;wer the Expence of endowing it, a charitable Sub&s;cription for that Purpo&s;e hath been propos'd and begun with good Succe&s;s. The Nece&s;&s;ity and Advantages of this In&s;titution are &s;o apparent, that Per&s;ons of all Ranks unite very heartily in promoting it; and as &s;everal of our mo&s;t eminent Phy&s;icians and Surgeons have freely offered their Service for &s;ome Years, we have good Grounds to expect that this Under|taking may be of general Service much &s;ooner than was at fir&s;t expected, and that our Legi&s;lature will &s;oon make a further Provi&s;ion for the Building, which we ap|prehend it will be prudent to contrive and erect in &s;uch Manner, as to admit of &s;uch Additions as the future State of the Province may require. The principal Dif|ficulty we now labour under, is the Want of a commodious Lot of Ground in a healthy Situation; for (tho' we have &s;o great Encouragement as we have men|tion'd) we cannot flatter our&s;elves with &s;peedily rai&s;ing a Sum &s;ufficient to enable us to provide for all other nece&s;&s;ary Charges, and to purcha&s;e a &s;uitable Piece of Ground &s;o near the built Part of the City, as the con&s;tant Attendance of the Phy|&s;icians, and other Con&s;iderations, will nece&s;&s;arily require: We are therefore under the Nece&s;&s;ity of laying the State of our Ca&s;e before our Proprietaries, and we hope the &s;ame Motives which have induced others, will have due Weight with them to pro|mote this good Work, and that they will generou&s;ly direct a Piece of Ground to be allotted for this Service.</P>
<P>THERE are &s;everal Lots in different Parts of this City very &s;uitable, but from their Situation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are of great Value for other Purpo&s;es; we have therefore thought of one, which is in a Part of the Town quite unimproved, and where, in all Probability, there will be the Conveniency of an open Air for many Years; it is the vacant Part of the Square between the <HI>Ninth</HI> and <HI>Tenth-&s;treets</HI> from <HI>Delaware,</HI> on the <HI>South</HI> Side of <HI>Mulberry-&s;treet,</HI> and is 396 Feet <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and <HI>We&s;t,</HI> and 360 Feet <HI>North</HI> and <HI>South.</HI> The Lots in this Part of the City have not advanced in Value
<PB N="10" REF="007197_0009_102B3939EF27ABA8">
for &s;everal Years pa&s;t, and are not likely to be &s;oon &s;ettled; &s;o that we are in Hopes, if you will favour us with your Application for this Piece of Ground, you will meet with no Difficulty in obtaining it.</P>
<P>THE Intere&s;t of the Proprietaries and People are &s;o nearly connected, that it &s;eems to us &s;elf-evident that they mutually &s;hare in whatever contributes to the Pro|&s;perity and Advantage of the Province; which Con&s;ideration, added to the Satisfac|tion ari&s;ing from Acts of Charity and Benevolence, will, we hope, have &s;o much Weight with them, as to render any other Argument &s;uperfluous; but as your own Prudence will &s;ugge&s;t to you the mo&s;t effectual Method of &s;olliciting this Addre&s;s &s;ucce&s;sfully, we rely thereon &s;o much, as to think it unnece&s;&s;ary to add any Thing more on this Occa&s;ion, than that your Friend&s;hip therein will be exceedingly grateful to us, and our Fellow-citizens in general; and next to obtaining the Lot we a&s;k for, the mo&s;t agreeable Service you can do us, is to obtain a &s;peedy An&s;wer; for the Promoting this Undertaking appears to us &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, that all concerned therein are unanimous in determining to prepare for the Building early in the Spring next Year.</P>

<P>WHEREAS it hath been repre&s;ented unto us, that there is a Want in our &s;aid Province of a common Ho&s;pital or Infirmary, for the Relief of &s;uch Poor as are afflicted with curable Di&s;ea&s;es; and that many of the good In|habitants thereof, to &s;upply that Defect, and out of a tender and charitable Regard to their Fellow-creatures, had voluntarily &s;ub&s;cribed, and were &s;till &s;ub&s;cribing, large Sums of Money, towards a Stock for the Support of &s;uch an Ho&s;pital; and that the A&s;&s;embly there, being petitioned by a Number of the Inhabitants of all Ranks and Denominations, had already granted <HI>Two Thou&s;and Pounds,</HI> for the Founding, Building and Furni&s;hing thereof; and that the Per&s;ons who had contributed towards the Stock thereof, or many of them, had, in the Month of <HI>July</HI> la&s;t pa&s;t, cho&s;en certain Per&s;ons to be Managers of the &s;aid intended Ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>AND whereas the &s;aid Managers have addre&s;&s;ed us, laying the &s;aid Affair before us, in Confidence that &s;o good and pious an Undertaking would not fail of our Approbation, and hoping, from the accu&s;tom'd Bounty of our Family in encourag|ing former De&s;igns of publick Utility to the People of our &s;aid Province, the pre|&s;ent would al&s;o receive our kind A&s;&s;i&s;tance; and that as private Per&s;ons rai&s;ed the Stock to &s;upport the Ho&s;pital, and the A&s;&s;embly were to build the Hou&s;e, &s;o that we would be plea&s;ed to favour the &s;aid Managers with the Grant of a Piece of Ground for the Buildings and nece&s;&s;ary Accommodations for the &s;aid Ho&s;pital; and al&s;o reque&s;ting our Sentiments, if any Thing &s;hould occur to us that we might think of Service with re&s;pect to the Management or Rules of the &s;aid Ho&s;pital:</P>

<P>T<HI>HE De&s;ign of the Ho&s;pital being (in it&s;elf) &s;o beneficent, and our honourable Pro|prietaries having fully expre&s;s'd their Approbation of it in &s;trong Terms, as well as declared their kind Intentions of aiding and a&s;&s;i&s;ting it, by granting a valuable Tract of Land, in a proper Place, for an Ho&s;pital; all therefore that &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary for us to do, is to convince our honourable Proprietaries, that the Methods by which they have pro|po&s;ed to aid and a&s;&s;i&s;t the Ho&s;pital, will by no Means an&s;wer the&s;e good Intentions, but are really incon&s;i&s;tent therewith.</HI></P>
<P><HI>WE mu&s;t then beg Leave to remark in the fir&s;t Place, with regard to the Charter, That as the Act of A&s;&s;embly is undoubtedly the be&s;t Grant of Incorporation that we can po&s;&s;ibly have, and as the Repre&s;entatives of the Freemen of this Province have generou&s;ly contributed towards the De&s;ign, we &s;hould fail of the Re&s;pect that is ju&s;tly due to them, were we to accept of any other, without obtaining &s;ome very great and manife&s;t Advan|tage by it; but that there are no &s;uch Advantages in the Charter propo&s;ed, is evident at fir&s;t View: On the contrary, we &s;hould by it be confined to &s;tricter Limits than we now are, particularly with re&s;pect to the Power of making By-Laws, and being &s;ubjected to Vi&s;itors of the Proprietaries Appointment. But that Clau&s;e which makes the Lot (and of Con&s;equence the Buildings on it) revert to the Proprietaries, on Failure of a Succe&s;&s;ion of Contributors, is &s;o weighty an Objection, that were there no other, we could not en|tertain
<PB N="15" REF="007197_0014_102B394517F26EA0">
the lea&s;t Thoughts of accepting the Charter; for as the Sum allowed for Support of the Ho&s;pital is limited, we may rea&s;onably conclude, that in Time there will cea&s;e to be a Succe&s;&s;ion of Contributors, and no Per&s;on can imagine that when that happens to be the Ca&s;e, the Lot and Buildings ought to become the private Property of any Man: And tho' the Act of A&s;&s;embly hath made Provi&s;ion in a Manner which may be liable to &s;ome Inconveniences, yet it can &s;carce fail of an&s;wering the Purpo&s;es fir&s;t intended. The Pro|prietaries, to be &s;ure, have not attended to the&s;e Con&s;equences, or they never would have propo&s;ed any Thing &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent with the De&s;ign they intended to promote.</HI></P>
<P><HI>AS to the Lot that the Proprietaries de&s;igned for the Ho&s;pital, it is &s;o &s;ituated, and &s;o circum&s;tanced, that it will by no Means be &s;uitable for the Purpo&s;e; it is a moi&s;t Piece of Ground, adjoining to the Brick-yards, where there are Ponds of &s;tanding Water, and therefore mu&s;t be unhealthy, and more fit for a Burying-place (to which U&s;e Part of it is already applied) than for any other Service; be&s;ides, as it is Part of a Square al|lotted by the late honourable Proprietary for publick U&s;es, as the old Maps of the City will &s;hew, our Fellow-citizens would tax us with Inju&s;tice to them, if we &s;hould accept of this Lot by a Grant from our pre&s;ent Proprietaries, in &s;uch Terms as would &s;eem to imply our a&s;&s;enting to their having a Right to the Remainder of the Square.</HI></P>

<P>WE now, on Behalf of the Contributors to the <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> Ho&s;pital, with much Gratitude and Re&s;pect, acknowledge the benevolent Di&s;po&s;ition you have manife&s;ted by your Indu&s;try and Care in &s;olliciting our Addre&s;s to our Pro|prietaries; and as we are fully convinced nothing hath been wanting on your Parts, we &s;hould have been much plea&s;ed that the Lot which the Proprietaries propo&s;ed for the Ho&s;pital, and the Terms of their Grant, were &s;uch as we de&s;ired, or could accept.</P>
<P>IMMEDIATELY after the Receipt of your Letter, with the Copy of that you had from the Proprietaries, our Pre&s;ident waited on the Governor, who was plea&s;ed to communicate to us the In&s;tructions he had received; and as the An|&s;wer given by the Proprietaries to you, may have induced you to think they had granted our Reque&s;t, we think it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end you a Copy of their In&s;tructions to the Governor, after Peru&s;al of which, and of the few Remarks we have made thereon, we have no Doubt you will approve of our Re&s;olutions not to accept of a Lot on the&s;e Terms.</P>
<P>BEFORE we agreed on the Addre&s;s to the Proprietaries, we &s;urvey'd the Square (of which the Lot propo&s;ed by them is a Part) and the Situation appeared to us in every Re&s;pect inconvenient and un&s;uitable for our Purpo&s;e: It is contiguous to the Brick-makers Grounds, from which the City hath been furni&s;hed with Bricks above Forty Years pa&s;t, &s;o that their large Ponds being continually filled with &s;tanding Water, renders the Neighbourhood unhealthy, and of cour&s;e ab&s;olutely improper for our Purpo&s;e, which is to re&s;tore the Sick to Health; and the only proper U&s;e of that Square will be for a Burying-ground, to which Service &s;ome Part of it hath been applied by a Grant from the Proprietaries; and the Di&s;&s;atis|faction which appeared, and &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ts among our Fellow-citizens, on the Pro|prietaries

claiming a Right to make that Grant is &s;o great, that if there were no other Objection, we would not run the Ri&s;que of encrea&s;ing it.</P>
<P>WE &s;till think that the Lot we fir&s;t mentioned is more &s;uitable for us than any other &s;o near the City, and of &s;o &s;mall Value, and we are not entirely without Hopes that the Proprietaries, who have &s;o fully declared their Approbation of our De&s;ign, will &s;till grant the &s;ame to us; we are a&s;&s;ured, if they regard their own Intere&s;t in the Affections of the People, or even attend to the Ju&s;tice of their concurring in the Promoting of every Scheme calculated for the Publick Utility of their Province, they will chearfully grant it to us: And if you &s;hould entertain the &s;ame Senti|ments, we reque&s;t you to renew your Sollicitations to them, and if you find them &s;till unwilling to favour our Reque&s;t, we &s;hould be plea&s;ed to know whether they will &s;ell it to us, or let it for ever on an annual Rent, and the Price or Rent they pro|po&s;e; for as the Number of Contributors &s;till continues gradually encrea&s;ing, we &s;hall rather endeavour to purcha&s;e a Lot in a proper Situation, than to build the Hou&s;e in an inconvenient Place, or to accept of any Lot on &s;uch Terms as we know would give a general Di&s;&s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>ONE of the Contributors hath offered to give a Lot of Ground much larger than that we now a&s;k, and in a very good Air, but being about a Mile out of Town, we are apprehen&s;ive it will be inconvenient to the Phy&s;icians, who, as they freely give their Attendance, &s;hould be &s;ubjected to as little Difficulty as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>WE have, for the pre&s;ent, hired a Hou&s;e tolerably convenient, into which we began to admit Patients about &s;ix Months &s;ince; the Number &s;ince received is Twenty-three, of which Twelve have been cured and di&s;charged, and Eleven are remaining; and as the Benefits of this In&s;titution become daily more attended to, we have not the lea&s;t Doubt that the Minds of &s;uch who are ble&s;&s;ed with the Means, will gradually become the more freely di&s;po&s;ed to contribute towards this good Work, and that it will &s;oon become of general Service to the People of this Pro|vince.</P>
<P>THE kind Manner in which you have chearfully engaged to &s;erve us, gives us Rea&s;on to think you will approve of our writing to you with &s;o much Freedom, we &s;hall not therefore offer any Apology for it.</P>

And as to the Remark again&s;t its reverting to the Proprietaries, be very readily declared nothing more was intended by the Clau&s;e in the Grant, than that pro|vided the Scheme for the E&s;tabli&s;hment and Continuance of the Ho&s;pital &s;hould not &s;ucceed, either for want of the Sum propo&s;ed to be rai&s;ed as a Fund, or through any other Cau&s;e, that then the Ground &s;hould revert,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>but as to the Erections thereon, they &s;hould be at the Managers Di&s;po&s;al.

On the whole, he came to this Re&s;olution, not to make any Alteration in what was before granted, nor to lett or &s;ell the Spot of Ground you pitch upon; and therefore we are of Opinion, you &s;hould either accept the Pro|prietary's Offer, with the Clau&s;e relating to the reverting to them being explained, or el&s;e to fix on &s;ome other Piece of Ground. And if there is no other Objection than the &s;mall Di&s;tance of a Mile to the Place which one of the Contributors hath offered to give you, may not that be more fit for an Ho&s;pital or Infirmary, than to have it in the City, where infections Di&s;ea&s;es may be much more liable to &s;pread.

<Q><P>AMONG all the innumerable Species of Animals which inhabit the Air, Earth and Water, &s;o exceedingly different in their Production, their Proper|ties, and the Manner of their Exi&s;tence, and &s;o varied in Form, that even of the &s;ame Kind, it can &s;carce be &s;aid there are two Individuals in all Re&s;pects alike; it is remarkable there are none within our Ob&s;ervation di&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t by this Particular, that they are by Nature incapable of Di&s;ea&s;es. The old Poets, how&punc; extravagant &s;oever in their Fictions, dur&s;t never offend &s;o far again&s;t Nature and Probability, as even to feign &s;uch a Thing; and therefore, tho' they made their <HI>Achilles</HI> invulnerable from Head to Foot, and clad him be&s;ide in impenetrable Armour, forg'd by the Immortals, they were obliged to leave one &s;oft unguarded Place in his Heel, how &s;mall &s;oever, for De&s;truction to enter at.&mdash;But tho' every Animal that hath Life is liable to Death, Man, of all other Creatures, has the greate&s;t Number of Di&s;ea&s;es to his Share; whether they are the Effects of our In|temperance and Vice, or are given us, that we may have a greater Opportunity of exerci&s;ing towards each other that Virtue, which mo&s;t of all recommends us to the Deity, I mean CHARITY.</P>
<P>THE great Author of our Faith, who&s;e Life &s;hould be the con&s;tant Object of our Imitation, as far as it is not inimitable, always &s;hew'd the greate&s;t Compa&s;&s;ion and Regard for the Sick; he di&s;dain'd not to vi&s;it and admini&s;ter Comfort and Health to the meane&s;t of the People; and he frequently inculcated the &s;ame Di&s;|po&s;ition in his Doctrine and Precepts to his Di&s;ciples. For this one Thing (in that beautiful Parable of the Traveller wounded by Thieves) the <HI>Samaritan</HI> (who was e&s;teemed no better than a Heretick or Infidel by the Orthodox of tho&s;e Times) is preferred to the Prie&s;t and the <HI>Levite,</HI> becau&s;e he did not, like them, pa&s;s by re|gardle&s;s of the Di&s;tre&s;s of his Brother Mortal, but when he came to the Place where the half-dead Traveller lay, <HI>he had Compa&s;&s;ion on him, and went to him, and bound up his Wounds, pouring in Oil and Wine, and &s;et him on his own Bea&s;t, and brought him to an Inn, and took Care of him.</HI>&mdash;<HI>Dives,</HI> al&s;o, the rich Man, is repre|&s;ented as being excluded from the Happine&s;s of Heaven, becau&s;e he fared &s;ump|tuou&s;ly every Day, and had Plenty of all Things, and yet neglected to comfort and a&s;&s;i&s;t his poor Neighbour, who was helple&s;s, and <HI>full of Sores,</HI> and might perhaps have been revived and re&s;tored with &s;mall Care, <HI>by the Crumbs that fell from his Table,</HI> or, as we &s;ay, <HI>with his loo&s;e Corns.</HI>&mdash;<HI>I was &s;ick, and ye vi&s;ited me,</HI> is one of the Terms of Admi&s;&s;ion into Bli&s;s, and the Contrary, a Cau&s;e of Exclu&s;ion: That is, as our Saviour him&s;elf explains it, <HI>Ye have vi&s;ited, or ye have not vi&s;ited, a&s;&s;i&s;ted and comforted tho&s;e who &s;tood in need of it, even tho' they were the lea&s;t, or meane&s;t of Mankind.</HI> This Branch of Charity &s;eems e&s;&s;ential to the true Spirit of
<PB N="19" REF="007197_0018_102B394D71410628">
Chri&s;tianity, and &s;hould be extended to all in General, whether De&s;erving or Un|de&s;erving, as far as our Power reaches. Of the ten Lepers who were clean&s;ed, nine &s;eem to have been much more unworthy than the Tenth, yet, in re&s;pect to the Cure of their Di&s;ea&s;e, they equally &s;hared the Goodne&s;s of GOD. And the great Phy&s;ician in &s;ending forth his Di&s;ciples, always gave them a particular Charge, <HI>that into what&s;oever City they entered, they &s;hould heal all the Sick,</HI> without Di&s;tinc|tion.</P>
<P>WHEN the good <HI>Samaritan</HI> left his Patient at the Inn, <HI>he gave Money to the Ho&s;t, and &s;aid, take Care of him, and what thou &s;pende&s;t more, I will repay thee.</HI> We are in this World mutual Ho&s;ts to each other; the Circum&s;tances and Fortunes of Men and Families are continually changing; in the Cour&s;e of a few Years we have &s;een the Rich become Poor, and the Poor Rich; the Children of the Wealthy lan|gui&s;hing in Want and Mi&s;ery, and tho&s;e of their Servants lifted into E&s;tates, and abounding in the good Things of this Life. Since then our pre&s;ent State, how pro&s;perous &s;oever, hath no Stability, but what depends on the good Providence of GOD, how careful &s;hould we be not to harden our Hearts again&s;t the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of our Fellow Creatures, left he who owns and governs All, &s;hould puni&s;h our Inhu|manity, deprive us of a Steward&s;hip in which we have &s;o unworthily behaved, <HI>laugh at our Calamity, and mock when our Fear cometh.</HI> Methinks when Objects of Charity, and Opportunities of relieving them, pre&s;ent them&s;elves, we &s;hould hear the Voice of this <HI>Samaritan,</HI> as if it were the Voice of GOD &s;ounding in our Ears, <HI>Take Care of them, and what&s;oever thou &s;pende&s;t, I will repay thee.</HI></P>
<P>BUT the Good particular Men may do &s;eparately in relieving the Sick, is &s;mall, compared with what they may do collectively, or by a joint Endeavour and Intere&s;t. Hence the Erecting of Ho&s;pitals or Infirmaries by Sub&s;cription, for the Reception, Entertainment, and Cure of the Sick Poor, has been found by Experience exceed|ingly beneficial, as they turn out annually great Numbers of Patients perfectly cured, who might otherwi&s;e have been lo&s;t to their Families, and to Society. Hence Infirmaries &s;pread more and more in <HI>Europe,</HI> new Ones being continually erected in large Cities and populous Towns, where generally the mo&s;t &s;kilful Phy|&s;icians and Surgeons inhabit. And the Sub&s;cribers have had the Satisfaction in a few Years of &s;eeing the Good they propo&s;ed to do, become much more exten&s;ive than was at fir&s;t expected; for the Multitude and Variety of Ca&s;es continually treated in tho&s;e Infirmaries, not only render the Phy&s;icians and Surgeons who at|tend them, &s;till more expert and &s;kilful, for the Benefit of others, but afford &s;uch &s;peedy and effectual In&s;truction to the young Students of both Profe&s;&s;ions, who come from different and remote Parts of the Country for Improvement, that they return with a more ample Stock of Knowledge in their Art, and become Ble&s;&s;ings to the Neighbourhoods in which they fix their Re&s;idence.</P>
<P>IT is therefore a great Plea&s;ure to all the Benevolent and Charitable, who have been acquainted with the&s;e Things in other Countries, to ob&s;erve, that an In&s;titu|tion of the &s;ame Kind has met with &s;uch Encouragement in <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> and is in &s;uch Forwardne&s;s, that there is Rea&s;on to expect it may be carried into Execution the en&s;uing Year. May the Father of Mercies grant it his Ble&s;&s;ing, and Thou&s;and of our unhappy Fellow Creatures, yet unborn, will have cau&s;e to ble&s;s him, for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

<Q><HI>Homines ad Deos, nulla re propius accedunt, quam Salutem Hominibus dando.</HI> <BIBL>CICER. ORAT.</BIBL></Q>
<P>THIS Motto, taken from a Pagan Author, expre&s;&s;es the general Sen&s;e of Mankind, even in the earlie&s;t Ages, concerning that great Duty and exten|&s;ive Charity, the admini&s;tring Comfort and Relief to the Sick. If Men, without any other A&s;&s;i&s;tance than the Dictates of natural Rea&s;on, had &s;o high an Opinion of it, what may be expected from Chri&s;tians, to whom it has been &s;o warmly re|commended by the be&s;t Example of human Conduct. To vi&s;it the Sick, to feed the Hungry, to clothe the Naked, and comfort the Afflicted, are the in&s;eparable Duties of a Chri&s;tian Life.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY 'tis ob&s;ervable, that the Chri&s;tian Doctrine hath had a real Effect on the Conduct of Mankind, which the mere Knowledge of Duty, without the Sanctions Revelation affords, never produced among the Heathens: For Hi|&s;tory &s;hows, that from the earlie&s;t Times of Chri&s;tianity, in all well regulated States where Chri&s;tians obtained &s;ufficient Influence, publick Funds and private Charities have been appropriated to the Building of Ho&s;pitals, for receiving, &s;up|porting, and curing tho&s;e unhappy Creatures, who&s;e Poverty is aggravated by the additional Load of bodily Pain. But of the&s;e Kind of In&s;titutions among the Pagans, there is no Trace in the Hi&s;tory of their Times.</P>
<P>THAT good Prince EDWARD VI. was &s;o affected at the Mi&s;eries of his poor di&s;ea&s;ed Subjects, repre&s;ented in a Charity Sermon preach'd to him on the Occa|&s;ion, that he &s;oon after laid the Foundation of four of the large&s;t Ho&s;pitals now in <HI>London,</HI> which the Citizens fini&s;hed, and have ever &s;ince maintain'd.</P>
<P>IN <HI>Hide-park,</HI> at <HI>Bath,</HI> in <HI>Edinburgh, Liverpool, Winche&s;ter,</HI> and in the County of <HI>Devon,</HI> and &s;undry other Places in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> large and commodious In|firmaries have been lately erected, from trifling Beginnings of private Charities: And &s;o wonderfully does Providence favour the&s;e pious In&s;titutions, that there is not an In&s;tance of any One's failing for want of nece&s;&s;ary charitable Contributions.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Extract from the</HI> Tour through Great-Britain, <HI>Vol.</HI> 3. <HI>Page</HI> 293.</P>
<P>IN the Year 1740, on the Promotion of Dr. <HI>Gilbert,</HI> Dean of this Church, to the Bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Land<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ff,</HI> his Maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed to confer the Deanery on Dr. <HI>Alured Clarke,</HI> who was in&s;talled in the Month of <HI>January,</HI> in that Year; and if we may be allowed to judge from the pious Acts he began with in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Station, a more worthy Man could not have been preferr'd thereto.</P>
<P>THE Hou&s;e, an ancient Building, belonging to that Dignity, had, thro' the Remi&s;&s;ne&s;s of its former Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, been too long neglected; wherefore his fir&s;t Work was to &s;et about altering and repairing that, which he did within nine Months of his In&s;talment, at an Expence of about <HI>Eight Hundred Pounds.</HI></P>
<P>BEFORE this was perfected, <HI>viz.</HI> in the Spring 1741, he drew up and publi&s;hed Propo&s;als for found|ing an Ho&s;pital in this City, for lodging, dieting, and curing the &s;ick and lame Poor thereof, and of the County of <HI>Devon,</HI> on the like Plan of that which he had before founded at <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> for the Benefit of that City, and County of <HI>Hants.</HI> A De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">gn &s;o good, recommended by the pious Elo|quence of a Divine &s;o learned and judicious, on Views &s;o vi&s;ibly di&s;intere&s;ted, and &s;o clearly ab|&s;tracted from all Party Schemes or Intentions, met with the general Applau&s;e and A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Gentry and Clergy of all Parties, Sects and Denominations; who, however different in Religion and Politicks, unanimou&s;ly join'd in this pious Undertaking: And a Sub&s;cription being opened in <HI>March,</HI> hath already <HI>(November,</HI> 1741<HI>)</HI> brought in about <HI>Two Thou&s;and Pounds,</HI> of which near <HI>Fif|teen Hundred Pounds</HI> are annual Engagements, which, 'tis highly probable, will be not only conti|nued, but much augmented, &s;o that 'tis hoped that Two Hundred Patients at a Time may be pro|vided for. <HI>John Tuckfield,</HI> of <HI>Radd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> was plea&s;ed to accommodate the Governors with a Plot of Ground near <HI>Southernbay,</HI> without the City Walls, at a very moderate Price, and to give <HI>One Hundred Pounds</HI> towards carrying on the Building for the intended Ho&s;pital, the Plan of which was commodiou&s;ly de&s;igned by the Direction of the Dean, and the fir&s;t Stone thereof laid by him, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Exon,</HI> Sir <HI>William Courtenay,</HI> Knight of the Shire, Sir <HI>Henry Northcote,</HI> and <HI>Hum|phry Sydenham,</HI> E&s;quires, the Citizens in Parliament, the Honourable <HI>Henry Rolle,</HI> and <HI>John Tuck|field,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> attended by a great Number of Clergy and Gentry, that are Sub&s;cribers, and Thou&s;ands of joyful Spectators, on the Twenty-&s;eventh of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> 1741.

THE Increa&s;e of poor di&s;ea&s;ed Foreigners and others, &s;ettled in the di&s;tant Parts of this Province, where regular Advice and A&s;&s;i&s;tance cannot be procured, but at an Expence that neither they nor their Town&s;hips can afford, has waken'd the At|tention of &s;undry humane and well di&s;po&s;ed Minds, to procure &s;ome more certain, effectual and ea&s;y Methods for their Relief than have hitherto been provided; and having repre&s;ented the Affair to the A&s;&s;embly, a Law was pa&s;&s;ed, without one di&s;&s;enting Voice, giving <HI>Two Thou&s;and Pounds</HI> for building and furni&s;hing a Pro|vincial Ho&s;pital, on Condition that <HI>Two Thou&s;and Pounds</HI> more &s;hould be rai&s;ed by private Donations, to be put out to Intere&s;t as Part of a perpetual Fund for &s;upporting it; and the Contributors were made a Body Corporate, with all the Pow|ers nece&s;&s;ary on the Occa&s;ion. Since which, People of all Ranks in this City have united zealou&s;ly and heartily in promoting this pious and excellent De&s;ign, and more than the Sum &s;tipulated was &s;ub&s;cribed in a few Days only, and a much larger Sum will probably be rai&s;ed here, if the Country chearfully contributes to the Capi|tal Stock&punc; which 'tis not to be doubted they will do, when they con&s;ider how much they are intere&s;ted in it.</P>
<P>THE Difference between nur&s;ing and curing the Sick in an Ho&s;pital, and &s;epa|rately in private Lodgings, with Regard to the Expence, is at lea&s;t as ten to one. For In&s;tance, &s;uppo&s;e a Per&s;on under the Nece&s;&s;ity of having a Limb amputated, he mu&s;t have the con&s;tant Attendance of a Nur&s;e, a Room, Fire, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which can|not for the fir&s;t three or four Weeks be procured at le&s;s Expence than <HI>Fifteen Shil|lings</HI> a Week, and never after at le&s;s than <HI>Ten:</HI> If he continues two Months, his Nur&s;ing will be <HI>Five Pounds,</HI> his Surgeon's Fee, and other accidental Charges, commonly amounts to <HI>Three Pounds,</HI> in the whole near <HI>Ten Pounds;</HI> whereas in an Ho&s;pital, one Nur&s;e, one Fire, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> will be &s;ufficient for ten Patients, the Extra Expences will be incon&s;iderable, and the Surgeons Fees taken off, which will bring the above Calculation within the Limits of Truth.</P>
<P>BUT the Difference with regard to the unhappy Sufferer is &s;till greater. In an Ho&s;pital his Ca&s;e will be treated according to the be&s;t Rules of Art, by Men of Experience and known Abilities in their Profe&s;&s;ion. His Lodgings will be com|modious, clean and neat, in an healthy and open Situation, his Diet will be well cho&s;en, and properly admini&s;tred: He will have many other nece&s;&s;ary Convenien|ces
<PB N="22" REF="007197_0021_102B395499A12458">
for his Relief, &s;uch as hot and cold Baths, Sweating-rooms, Chirurgic Ma|chines, Bandage, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which can rarely be procured in the be&s;t private Lodgings, much le&s;s in tho&s;e mi&s;erable loath&s;ome Holes, which are the common Receptacles of the di&s;ea&s;ed Poor that are brought to this City.&mdash;In &s;hort, a Beggar, in a well regulated Ho&s;pital, &s;tands an equal Chance with a Prince in his Palace for a com|fortable Sub&s;i&s;tence, and an expeditious and effectual Cure of his Di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>IT is hoped therefore, that whoever will maturely con&s;ider the ine&s;timable Ble&s;&s;ings that are connected to a proper Execution of the pre&s;ent Ho&s;pital Scheme in this City, can never be &s;o void of Humanity, and the e&s;&s;ential Duties of Re|ligion, as to turn a deaf Ear to the numberle&s;s Cries of the Poor and Needy, and refu&s;e, for their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, a little of that Superfluity, which a bountiful Provi|dence has &s;o liberally be&s;towed on them.</P></Q>
<P>ON the Sixteenth of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> it being made appear, to the Satisfaction of the A&s;&s;em|bly, that the Contributions amounted to upwards of <HI>Two Thou&s;and Pounds,</HI> an Order was obtained for the <HI>Two Thou&s;and Pounds</HI> that had been conditionally granted by the Act, <HI>One Thou&s;and Pounds</HI> to be paid immediately, the other in Twelve Months. The Money, when received, was lett out at Intere&s;t on good Security, that it might be improving till it &s;hould be wanted for the Building, which the Managers were obliged to po&s;tpone till a Piece of Ground could be obtained that would afford &s;uf|ficient Room in an airy, healthy Situation, and yet &s;o nigh the built Streets of the City, as that the Managers, Phy&s;icians and Surgeons, might readily and conveniently vi&s;it the Hou&s;e on every Occa&s;ion. But that &s;ome Good might be doing in the mean Time, the Managers concluded to hire a Hou&s;e, and take in &s;ome Patients for a Beginning; but &s;ome Doubts ari&s;ing concerning the Power and Duty of the Managers, a general Meeting of the Contributors was called to &s;ettle the &s;ame, and the following Law was pa&s;&s;ed for tho&s;e and other Purpo&s;es, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<P>ABOUT the Beginning of this Year twelve Tin Boxes were provided, on which were written the&s;e Words in Gold Letters, <HI>CHARITY FOR THE HO|SPITAL.</HI> One Box for each Manager, to be put up in his Hou&s;e, ready to re|ceive ca&s;ual Benefactions, in Imitation of a good Cu&s;tom practi&s;ed in &s;ome foreign Countries, where the&s;e Kind of Boxes are frequent in Shops, Stores, and other Places of Bu&s;ine&s;s, and into which the Buyer and Seller (when different Prices are propo&s;ed) often agree to throw the Difference, in&s;tead of &s;plitting it: In which the Succe&s;sful in Trade &s;ometimes piou&s;ly depo&s;ite a Part of their extraordinary Gains, and Magi&s;trates throw their petty Fees; a Cu&s;tom worthy Imitation! But the&s;e Boxes among us have produced but little for the Ho&s;pital as yet, not through want of Cha|rity in our People, but from their being unacquainted with the Nature and De&s;ign of them.</P>
<P>IN <HI>March,</HI> 1753, Doctor <HI>Lloyd Zachary,</HI> who had diligently attended the Ho|&s;pital from the Beginning, being di&s;abled by a paralytick Di&s;order, Doctor <HI>William Shippen</HI> was about this Time cho&s;en, by the Managers, to &s;upply his Place.</P>

FROM the foregoing Accounts it appears, That from the Tenth of <HI>February&punc;</HI> 1752, to the Twenty-&s;eventh of <HI>April,</HI> 1754, which is but about two Years and two Months, &s;ixty Per&s;ons, afflicted with various Di&s;tempers, have been cured, be|&s;ides many others that have received con&s;iderable Relief, both In and Out-patients; and if &s;o much Good has been done by &s;o &s;mall a Number of Contributors, how much more then may rea&s;onably be expected from the liberal Aid and A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Well-di&s;po&s;ed who hitherto have not join'd in the Undertaking? Experience has more and more convinced all concerned, of the great U&s;efulne&s;s of this Chari|ty.&mdash;The careful Attendance afforded to the Sick Poor; the Neatne&s;s, Cleanne&s;s, and Regularity of Diet with which they are kept in the Ho&s;pital, are found to contribute to their Recovery much &s;ooner than their own Manner of Living at Home, and render the Phy&s;ick they take more effectual.

<P>IT is therefore hoped, that by additional Benefactions from pious and benevolent Per&s;ons (an Account of which will be publi&s;hed yearly according to Law) this Cha|rity may be farther extended, &s;o as to embrace with open Arms all the Sick Poor that need the Relief it affords, and that the Managers will not, in Time to come, be under a Nece&s;&s;ity, from the Narrowne&s;s of the Funds, of refu&s;ing Admittance to any proper Object. <Q>It is hoped that a deaf Ear will not be turn'd to the Cries of tho&s;e, in who&s;e Favour both Religion and Humanity &s;trongly plead; who are recommended by the great Pattern of human Conduct; who in Sickne&s;s are lo&s;t to Society; who contribute greatly to the In&s;truction of tho&s;e Youth to whom the Lives of High and Low may hereafter be entru&s;ted, who&s;e Prayers are to be &s;ent up for their Deliverers; but that all will a&s;&s;i&s;t to render the Funds of this Ho&s;pital an&s;werable to the Nece&s;&s;ities of the Poor.&mdash;Incapacity of contributing can by none be pleaded; the Rich only indeed can be&s;tow large Sums, but mo&s;t can &s;pare &s;omething yearly, which collected from many, might make a hand&s;ome Revenue, by which great Numbers of di&s;tre&s;s'd Objects can be taken Care of, and relieved, many of whom may po&s;&s;ibly one Day make a Part of the ble&s;&s;ed Company above, when a Cup of cold Water given to them will not be unrewarded. Let People but reflect what unnece&s;&s;ary Expences they have been at in any Year for vain Superfluities or Entertainments, for mere Amu&s;ements or Diver&s;ions, or per|haps in vicious Debauches; and then let them put the Que&s;tion to them&s;elves, Whether they do not wi&s;h that Money had been given in the Way now propo&s;ed?
