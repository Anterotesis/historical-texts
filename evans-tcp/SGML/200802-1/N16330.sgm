</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THROUGH the exceeding deceitfulne&s;s of &s;in, wicked people are in&s;en&s;ible of what they are doing again&s;t GOD, and the dreadful mi&s;chief they are bringing upon them&s;elves. "<HI>Their fooli&s;h heart is darkened&mdash;they will not come to the light&mdash;they know not, neither will they under&s;tand&mdash;they walk on in darkne&s;s.</HI>" It mu&s;t give every one much pain who has come to him&s;elf, and has &s;uitable feelings to|wards GOD and his law, to &s;ee multitudes of his fellow creatures around him living in their &s;ins, and at ea&s;e in open rebellion again&s;t JEHOVAH, and ei|ther imagining that it is very ea&s;y for them, by and by, to move the divine compa&s;&s;ion, by their cries and profe&s;&s;ions of &s;orrow; or flatter them&s;elves that their wickedne&s;s is rather a calamity, than an evil infinitely hateful and odious to GOD; and renders them ju&s;tly de&s;erving of his eternal wrath. What is more difficult for any of us to do, than to make wicked people believe that they hate GOD&mdash;ere en|emies to him&mdash;are continually heaping up mi&s;chief
<PB N="6" REF="020955_0004_0FB14CF1D1F68E78">
upon them&s;elves, and in effect love hell (for they love the way to it exceedingly) although HE that cannot lie, &s;ays in my text,&mdash;<HI>he that &s;inneth again&s;t me, wrongeth his own &s;oul: all they that hate me, love death.</HI> Our text pre&s;ents to view two ob&s;ervations, which merit our attention at this time.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. The great evil of &s;inners lies in their oppo&s;i|tion to GOD, and enmity again&s;t him.</P>
<P N="2">2d. Sinners by their oppo&s;ition to GOD, do ex|ceedingly wrong them&s;elves.</P>
<P N="1">1. The great evil of &s;inners lies in their oppo|&s;ition to GOD, and enmity again&s;t him. This is very evident from the holy &s;criptures, and e&s;pecially from the following texts. "<HI>Wherefore do the wick|ed contemn GOD&mdash;The carnal mind is enmity again&s;t GOD&mdash;If when we were enemies we were reconcil'd to GOD by the death of his &s;on.</HI>" It is further evident that the great evil of &s;inners lies in oppo&s;ition to GOD, from the confe&s;&s;ion and declaration of true penitents recorded in the divine oracles, &s;ays Jo&s;eph, <HI>how &s;hall I do this great evil and &s;in again&s;t GOD?</HI>&mdash;&s;ays the P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>again&s;t thee, and thee only, have I &s;inned, and done this evil.</HI> And furthermore, on the account of the wicked being oppo&s;ed to GOD, and unlike him, they are often called ungodly in the ho|ly word.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is further evident that the evil of &s;inners lies in oppo&s;ition to GOD, becau&s;e &s;in is a violation of the divine law. All &s;ins whatever that people commit, are a violation of GOD's law; therefore, a contempt of his authority, and wholly oppo&s;ed to him. All &s;ins again&s;t &s;ociety, again&s;t rulers, parents, Ma&s;ters, and guardians; yea all &s;ins of thought, word and deed, are violations of GOD's holy law; therefore expre&s;s oppo&s;ition, and enmity again&s;t him.</P>
<P N="3">3. That &s;inners are oppo&s;ed to GOD, and hate him, is evident from plain facts.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="7" REF="020955_0005_0FB14CF347FF0AF8">1. It is evident that &s;inners hate GOD, becau&s;e they will not believe what he &s;ays to them. "<HI>He &s;peaks once, yea twice, but they regard him not.</HI>" GOD &s;peaks excellent and important things, very often to &s;inners, for a long &s;ea&s;on, but they will not believe a word he &s;ays. "<HI>He that believeth not GOD hath made him a liar.</HI>" Now, what great evidence of di&s;like do we &s;hew to a fellow creature, when we make him a liar? and how exceeding worthle&s;s, do we view him, who&s;e word is not worth regarding? There|fore, what greater evidence of enmity, can we ex|hibit again&s;t GOD, than to pay no regard to what he &s;ays?</P>
<P N="2">2. Another evidence of hating GOD, is, their being unwilling to have him do as he plea&s;es.&mdash; They di&s;like what he does and are unwilling to tru&s;t him. GOD wills many things which &s;inners are di&s;plea&s;ed with. They had rather have the man|agement of all matters which re&s;pect them, than to have GOD manage them. They had rather tru&s;t them&s;elves, than tru&s;t GOD. They have a better opinion of them&s;elves, than they have of GOD; and think that they can manage affairs better than he does. Hence it is, that &s;inners are &s;o often com|plaining as we read in the Proverbs of Solomon,&mdash; <HI>The fooli&s;hne&s;s of man perverteth his way, and his <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> fretteth again&s;t the Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Another evidence of &s;inners hating GOD, is their being &s;o exceeding aver&s;e to an acquaintance with him. They chu&s;e to keep at a di&s;tance from GOD; and are not fond of his company. Their language is, (as we read in the lively oracles,) <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> from us, we de&s;ire not the knowledge of thy ways.</HI> Wick+ed people are not fond of admitting thoughts of GOD, and his character. They are fond of ad|mitting vain, fooli&s;h, covetous, and unclean thoughts,
<PB N="8" REF="020955_0006_0FB14CF4D5B5EC20">
they are fond of letting &s;uch thoughts dwell within them: but they will reject &s;erious, godly, and reli|gious thoughts, and can't endure them. They are fond of knowing many things which are exceeding hurtful and dangerous to them; but are not fond of knowing GOD, JESUS CHRIST and the way to heav|en. They will not take proper pains to know the&s;e things. Thoughts of GOD, his ways, and doings are a burden to them; but they delight exceedingly in evil thoughts, and in evil companions.</P>
<P N="4">4. Another evidence of &s;inners hating GOD, is their being aver&s;e to &s;peaking in his prai&s;e. They can ea&s;ily &s;peak in prai&s;e of GOD's enemies; they can ea&s;ily &s;peak in favour of them that do wickedly: But, when they &s;ee the holy name of GOD pro|faned, and his honour trampled in the du&s;t, they can't find it in their hearts to &s;ay any thing for him. They are willing to &s;tand up for evil doers; but are not willing to &s;tand up for GOD again&s;t evil do|ers. When per&s;ons are not di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ay any thing in favour of a neighbour, or ever to take his part, although they &s;ee him de&s;pi&s;ed and mo&s;t &s;hame|fully abu&s;ed; it is an evidence that they are de&s;titute of all true love for him, even &s;o when people will &s;ay nothing in GOD's prai&s;e&mdash;will never take his part again&s;t evil doers, when he is awfully and dreadfully di&s;honoured&mdash;it is an evidence that they have no true love for him.</P>
<P N="5">5. Another evidence of &s;inners hating GOD, is, their being &s;o exceedingly aver&s;e to &s;erving him, and doing that which is plea&s;ing in his &s;ight. The &s;ervice of GOD, is &s;uch a burden to wicked people that they can't bear it. They <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ll not pray to GOD &mdash;they can't endure this part of divine &s;ervice&mdash;they can &s;ee no plea&s;ure, or no profit in religious &s;ervices. Hence, we read in the divine oracles&mdash;<HI>The wicked
<PB N="9" REF="020955_0007_0FB14CF6504757D8">
through the pride of his countenance will not &s;eek after GOD. Who is the Lord that we &s;hould &s;erve him? and what profit is it if we pray unto him?</HI></P>
<P>Now, when a &s;ervant is exceedingly aver&s;e to the &s;ervice of his ma&s;ter, can't bear it, and will not try to plea&s;e him; this is an evidence that he hates him. Even &s;o, when wicked people hate the &s;ervice of GOD, hate to plea&s;e him, and even delight in doing what is very di&s;plea&s;ing to him; it is mani|fe&s;t that they have enmity again&s;t him.</P>
<P N="6">6. Another evidence of &s;inners hating GOD, is, their holding fa&s;t their &s;ins, and refu&s;ing to repent, and turn to him; although he gives them many calls and invitations, and u&s;es ble&s;&s;ed means with them to promote their eternal &s;alvation. He tells them what a great evil &s;in is&mdash;that it is the troubler of the whole creation&mdash;that it brings temporal and eternal mi&s;ery. He al&s;o tells them what &s;inners they are &mdash;that they have trea&s;ured up much &s;in, made them|&s;elves exceedingly vile, and de&s;erve to be eternally bani&s;hed from his pre&s;ence. Yet a&s;&s;ures them, "<HI>that there is forgivene&s;s, and plenteous redemption, if they will put away the evil of their doings from before his eyes&mdash;that he has la<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> help on one mighty to &s;ave, who&s;e blood clean&s;es from all &s;in.</HI>" He al&s;o a&s;&s;ures them that they are wel|come to come to Chri&s;t by faith, and have pardon, peace and eternal life. He gives them repeated calls and warnings. He rea&s;ons with them&mdash;Wilt thou never be made clean, when &s;hall it once be?&mdash; turn ye, turn ye, for why will ye die? for&s;ake the fooli&s;h and live, and go in the way of under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>The ble&s;&s;ed Lord exerci&s;eth great patience to|wards &s;inners, therefore &s;ays, behold I &s;tand at the door and knock, if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come unto him and &s;up with him and he with me. Yet, "<HI>after all, they &s;et at nought his coun|&s;els
<PB N="10" REF="020955_0008_0FB14CF7CF849090">
and will none of his reproofs.</HI>" They have &s;uch a love for their lu&s;ts that they will not part with them. They chu&s;e to hold communion and fellow&s;hip with GOD's enemies&mdash;they will nouri&s;h and &s;upport them&mdash;they will have their &s;ins, let GOD do as he plea&s;es. They make nothing of all the good which GOD holds up to their view: they &s;et at nought his love, faithfulne&s;s and mo&s;t tender compa&s;&s;ions.&mdash; From &s;uch conduct as this it is very apparent that &s;inners hate GOD.</P>
<P N="7">7. The enmity of &s;inners again&s;t GOD is manife&s;t from their conduct towards the Lord JESUS CHRIST who is GOD, and was manife&s;t in the fle&s;h. The Lord JESUS is the illu&s;tious per&s;onage, who &s;peaks in my text; and one whom &s;inners hated &s;o much while upon earth, that they would not &s;uffer him to live. They hated him to &s;uch a degree, that they prefered a murderer before him; and would not be ea&s;y till they had put him to the accur&s;ed death of the cro&s;s, between two thieves. But let it be fur|ther ob&s;erved, that nothing can be &s;o vile and ba&s;e as the enmity of &s;inners again&s;t GOD, and JESUS CHRIST the expre&s;s image of the Father's per&s;on: Therefore, he &s;ays to &s;inners, this cometh to pa&s;s that it might be fulfilled that is written in their law, they hated me without a cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Sinners don't hate GOD, becau&s;e he has injured them, or done them the lea&s;t inju&s;tice, or given them the lea&s;t provocation. But they hate him for the &s;ame rea&s;on that St. Paul's hearers hated him, viz. becau&s;e he told them the truth. GOD tells &s;inners the truth which they can't endure, therefore they hate him. GOD abhors the wicked works of &s;inners and oppo&s;es them; and on this account they hate him. GOD can't bear with their "<HI>whori&s;h heart which departs from him; and their eyes which go whoring
<PB N="11" REF="020955_0009_0FB14CF9472112C0">
after their idols</HI>;" therefore oppo&s;es them and threat|ens their de&s;truction: on this account they hate him. GOD is an exceeding good ma&s;ter, full of love, wi&s;|dom, ju&s;tice and the mo&s;t tender compa&s;&s;ions: but &s;inners &s;ay that he is a hard ma&s;ter, and they will not have him to rule over them. The &s;ervice of GOD is an exceeding good &s;ervice; plea&s;ant and rea&s;onable; calculated to make us comfortable and happy in time, and to eternity. But wicked people hate and con|temn GOD, becau&s;e he requires them to &s;erve him. Upon the whole, it appears from the holy word, from &s;inners not believing GOD&mdash;di&s;liking what he does &mdash;aver&s;ion to an acquaintance with him&mdash;not &s;peak|ing in his prai&s;e&mdash;unwilling to &s;erve him&mdash;not re|penting&mdash;and their cruel treatment of the LORD of GLORY, that they hate him, and that their great e|vil lies in oppo&s;ition to him.</P>
<P N="2">II. I am to &s;hew that &s;inners by their oppo&s;ition to GOD, do exceedingly wrong them&s;elves. Sin and puni&s;hment are in&s;eparably connected. Sin|ners by their enmity again&s;t GOD, and oppo&s;ition to him, procure much mi&s;chief to them&s;elves: for they greatly incen&s;e the divine wrath, and move the righteous GOVERNOUR of the world to vi&s;it their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions with the rod, and their iniquities with &s;tripes. By the holy appointment of Him who al|ways does right, evil pur&s;ues &s;inners in this world, and without true repentance to all eternity&punc;</P>
<P N="1">1. Sinners by their oppo&s;ition to GOD, de&s;troy the peace of their own minds, and procure to them|&s;elves terrors. Sinners are haunted with a guilty con&s;cience, which produces fear where no fear is.&mdash; They know in their con&s;ciences that they de&s;erve puni&s;hment for their unrea&s;onable oppo&s;ition to the great and holy GOD; no wonder then, that they tra|vel in pain, and are like the troubled &s;ea, who&s;e wa|ters
<PB N="12" REF="020955_0010_0FB14CFAC8873658">
ca&s;t forth mire and dirt. Can a &s;oul abide in &s;acred peace when defiled with fle&s;hly lu&s;ts? Will a life of irreligion, and debauchery, produce &s;olid peace and quietne&s;s of mind?&mdash;Will covetou&s;ne&s;s, pride, envy, malice, hatred, deceit, hypocri&s;y, and a whori&s;h heart produce &s;weet peace, and con|&s;olation of &s;oul? We may as well expect to gather grapes of thorns and figs of thi&s;tles, or that a foun|tain will &s;end forth at the &s;ame place &s;weet water and bitter.</P>
<P>What injury then do &s;inners do to them&s;elves by their oppo&s;ition to GOD? What a life of bondage do they lead? how are they con&s;umed with terrors.</P>
<P N="2">2. Di&s;tre&s;&s;ing pain, and bodily &s;ickne&s;s, are the productions of &s;in. Sinners by the gratification of their lu&s;ts, and the works of the fle&s;h, bring painful and dangerous di&s;ea&s;es upon them&s;elves. Hence we read in the lively oracles, that men are cha&s;tened with pain upon their beds; and the multitude of their bones with &s;trong pain, till their fle&s;h con&s;umes away, and their bones &s;tick out&mdash;and for this cau&s;e many are &s;ickly and weakly among you, and many fallen a&s;leep. How many by their unclean practices and intemperate living procure to them&s;elves loath|&s;ome, and dangerous di&s;ea&s;es, and weari&s;ome days and nights; Both &s;cripture, and ob&s;ervation teaches us, that a life filled up with God-provoking &s;ins is not favourable to health and length of days.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">. Poverty and &s;hame, are often the productions of a wicked life, or a life of rebellion again&s;t GOD. How many by riotous living, wa&s;te their &s;ub&s;tance and by unclean practi&s;es are brought to a mor&s;el of bread and, by &s;uch a line of conduct how many plunge into &s;hame and di&s;grace? How many by their fondne&s;s for evil companions, and the coun&s;els
<PB N="13" REF="020955_0011_0FB14CFC46B5C218">
of the wicked become exceeding poor and de&s;picable in the world? Hence, &s;aith Solomon, he that follow|eth after vain per&s;ons &s;hall have poverty enough.&mdash; Poverty and &s;hame &s;hall be to him that refu&s;eth in|&s;truction&mdash;The drunkard and the glutton &s;hall come to poverty. How many by a &s;lothful, indolent and &s;tupid way of living, are in&s;nared and reduced to beggary? Many there are among mankind who do exceedingly deba&s;e them&s;elves, by ungodly and wick|ed practices, and become de&s;picable beyond all com|pari&s;on. Such per&s;ons make them&s;elves bruti&s;h, yea, wor&s;e than bruti&s;h, for they fit them&s;elves for &s;udden de&s;truction.</P>
<P N="4">4. Sinners by their rebellion again&s;t the LORD of HOSTS, procure to them&s;elves &s;ore, wa&s;ting and de&s;|olating judgments of a public nature. GOD is plea&s;|ed in his holy providence, to bring the iniquities of &s;inners upon them&s;elves, and to cut them off in their own wickedne&s;s. Wickedne&s;s often overthrows &s;in|ners in this world. The vengeance of Heaven of|ten pur&s;ues and overtakes the ungodly, in this world &mdash;takes from them their various comforts at one aw|ful &s;troke; and &s;weeps them away by a &s;udden death and dreadful overthrow. Witne&s;s the waters of No|ah&mdash;the &s;lames of Sodom&mdash;Pharaoh and his ho&s;ts in the red Sea&mdash;the plagues of Egypt&mdash;the earth ex|panding her jaws, and &s;wallowing up Korah and his accomplices&mdash;the fire from heaven which de&s;troyed tho&s;e who invaded the &s;acred function&mdash;the plague that went out from the LORD and de&s;troyed fourteen thou&s;and who murmured and fretted again&s;t the LORD and Mo&s;es&mdash;the de&s;truction of the nations of Canaan&mdash;the de&s;truction of Jeru&s;alem&mdash;the Babylo|nian captivity&mdash;the de&s;truction of the Jews by the Roman army&mdash;yea, the pe&s;tilence&mdash;the many famines wars and rumours of wars, and garments rolled in
<PB N="14" REF="020955_0012_0FB14CFDC7BCBA68">
blood; which have been in every age, and in every place, &s;weeping mankind from the earth; are wit|ne&s;&s;es of the dreadful wrong and injury &s;inners bring upon them&s;elves by their oppo&s;ition to GOD.</P>
<P N="5">5. Sinners by violating the law of GOD, and &s;et|ing them&s;elves again&s;t him: bring upon them&s;elves the &s;word of the civil magi&s;trate, which is ordained for their puni&s;hment. Hence we read in Rom. xiii. for he is the mini&s;ter of GOD to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid for he beareth not the &s;word in vain: for he is the mini&s;ter of GOD a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth e|vil. Many there are, who make them&s;elves &s;o in|tolerable to &s;ociety by their crimes, that the Lord will not allow them to live in peace, and pro&s;per in their wickedne&s;s: but commands the civil magi&s;trate to be upon them with his &s;word, and execute the &s;entence of the law. Many there are who are great troublers of &s;ociety, and the LORD has commanded the civil magi&s;trate to trouble them. There are many who&s;e conduct is &s;o dangerous and intolera|ble, that the laws of GOD and man will not admit of their being at liberty, but require their immediate confinement in a dark and dreary pri&s;on; where alas! they have many days and nights of adver&s;ity. But this puni&s;hment is not in many ca&s;es &s;ufficient. Ju&s;|tice requires them to be conducted from the pri&s;on to the &s;take, the pillory and the gallows; and there, like brutes to receive corporal and ignominious pun|i&s;hment. But this mode of puni&s;hment is too light for many, on the account of their attrocious crimes. The law of GOD and man, will not &s;uffer them to live; but requires that they be immediately put to death. "<HI>He that &s;heddeth man's blood, by man &s;hall his blood be &s;hed&mdash;and the murderer &s;hall &s;urely be put to death.</HI>" If by all the mi&s;chief and di&s;tre&s;s which
<PB N="15" REF="020955_0013_0FB14D005AAFAA40">
&s;inners bring upon them&s;elves in this world, they might be brought to true repentance; have a new heart, and a new &s;pirit given them, happy, un&s;peak|ably happy for them! for then like the thief upon the cro&s;s, they might go from the gallows, or place of execution, to be forever with CHRIST in the para|di&s;e of GOD! Their troubles would be forever at an end, when they leave this world, and their &s;tate exceedingly bli&s;sful to all eternity! But alas! how many will not be content with all the dreadful mi&s;|chief they bring upon them&s;elves in this world, by their God-provoking &s;ins; will not repent&mdash;will not reform&mdash;will not lay a&s;ide their enmity again&s;t GOD: but will keep their &s;ins and die in them; therefore can have no better portion than an eternal confine|ment in the pri&s;on of hell. As they will not heark|en unto GOD, and cea&s;e from their rebellion again&s;t him&mdash;as they hate GOD, and will not have him to rule over them&mdash;as they are incorrigible, and will not come unto CHRIST and have life&mdash;they &s;hall die in their iniquities; go to their own people in the re|gions of horror and keen de&s;pair&mdash;where the &s;moke of their torment a&s;cendeth up forever and ever.&mdash; This is the &s;econd death, eternal death, and as &s;in|ners love the way to it, and will not have any other way&mdash;&s;o death they mu&s;t have; it is the fruit of their own way, and their own devices.</P>

They mu&s;t de|light exceedingly in his laws, becau&s;e they are holy, ju&s;t and good; and be willing to tru&s;t GOD; and leave all their concerns with him, both for time and for eternity. This is a great and important change indeed; which the &s;criptures hold up to our view, as nece&s;&s;ary for every per&s;on, who would have any ra|tional hope of being admitted into the heavenly world when they die. "<HI>Except a man be born again he cannot &s;ee the kingdom of Heaven.</HI>"</P>
<P N="2">2. Seeing &s;in is &s;o great an evil, and brings &s;o much trouble upon mankind; what matter of grief and lamentation is it, that there is &s;o much &s;in cleaving to us. No evil can be wor&s;e than &s;in, for it is the &s;ource of all mi&s;ery and di&s;tre&s;s. If therefore we have rea&s;on to be grieved and &s;orry for any thing, it is, that we have &s;o much of the evil of &s;in within us. Above all things in the world we &s;hould dread the evil of &s;in; and be more afraid of &s;inning than of &s;uffering. When we con&s;ider that it is again&s;t GOD, and him alone that we have &s;inned, and done great evil; and how poi&s;onous, &s;hameful, de&s;tructive and dangerous an evil &s;in is; how can we refrain from many tears, and help being pained at our very hearts?</P>
<P N="3">3. Seeing &s;in is &s;o great an evil, as it is again&s;t GOD, and brings &s;o much mi&s;chief upon mankind; how thankful &s;hould we be to GOD, for r<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">aining grace; whereby we have been kept from many &s;ins, which others have been guilty of, to thair great dam|age.

It is not becau&s;e others who have committed more open and &s;hameful &s;ins; and brought more trouble upon them&s;elves, than we have; are wor&s;e by nature than we are: for undoubtedly we have the &s;ame corrupt and depraved natures as they have.&mdash; But our not doing as they have done is owing to that re&s;training grace granted us which has not been grant|ed them. It has been very ju&s;tly withheld from them, and might have been very ju&s;tly withheld from us; for who of us have not long &s;ince forfeited all right to it? How much &s;candalous and abominable wicked|ne&s;s &s;hould many of us have committed, had we not been helped by divine re&s;traints? And how many troubles &s;hould we &s;oon bring upon our&s;elves, if left to fall a prey to our own lu&s;ts? Let us then adore that almighty being who has kept us back from many dangerous &s;ins: by means of education, religious in|&s;tructions, coun&s;els and reproo&s;s, gentle rebukes of providence, and the &s;trivings of the holy &s;pirit.</P>
<P N="4">4. We learn that &s;inners, are the greate&s;t fools that can be found in the whole creation. They are fools for &s;eting them&s;elves again&s;t GOD; for they can't pro&s;per&mdash;can maintain no &s;trength again&s;t him.&mdash; They are fools for treating GOD as they do, for they &s;ay the LORD does not &s;ee nor hear them. If they can &s;in out of the &s;ight of man, they care not how many &s;ins they commit; as if the great eternal was not worth regarding. But alas! his eye is continually upon them and knows all their &s;ecret abominations, even every thought and will make them known that he is the LORD. Not one of their &s;ins can be forgotten, all &s;hall be brought into judgment again&s;t them&mdash; and they can't e&s;cape&mdash;"<HI>There is no darkne&s;s nor &s;had|ow of death where the workers of iniquity can hide them|&s;elves.</HI>" What fools mu&s;t they be who &s;et them&s;elves again&s;t the GOD of infinite power, maje&s;ty, worth

<P>Sinners are guilty of the mo&s;t egregious folly by wilfully bringing &s;o much trouble upon them&s;elves&punc; their enmity is turn'd again&s;t them&s;elves: and they don't at all regard their own intere&s;t. They will go on to bring mi&s;chief upon them&s;elves, even while they are fairly and plainly warned of what is coming upon them. They will go on to trouble them&s;elves by their &s;ins, even while they are not only warned and be&s;ought by the mini&s;ters of CHRIST, and their dear friends, but even while they are warned and be|&s;ought by the great JEHOVAH him&s;elf. They bring &s;o many troubles upon them&s;elves by their own wickedne&s;s; that they have a hell upon earth of their own making.

<P>Unhappy woman. As time is ju&s;t about to leave you, and eternity to receive you; what &s;hall I &s;ay? Who is &s;ufficient for the arduous talk of addre&s;&s;ing you, upon this awful occa&s;ion? For the horrid wick|edne&s;s

of murder, you are condemned to die, by the law of GOD and man. You are verily guilty concerning your infant child, in that you &s;aw him, a helple&s;s defencele&s;s babe; who had neither injured you nor any of your fellow creatures: your own child, born of your own body, whom you had been wickedly in|&s;trumental of bringing into the world; yet you hard|ened your heart again&s;t him, and determined that you would not exerci&s;e &s;o much compa&s;&s;ion towards him as the &s;ea mon&s;ters, who draw out their brea&s;ts, and give &s;uck to their young ones; but with violent hands you put him to death. Be a&s;toni&s;hed O earth at the wickedne&s;s of your heart! You have thought that this crime of murdering your child, was not &s;o great as the murder of an adult per&s;on. But, let me tell you, that the murder you are guilty of, is attend|ed with more dreadful aggravations than common murder. In many if not mo&s;t in&s;tances of murder, there is either &s;ome provocation, or injury received from the per&s;on murdered, or a pro&s;pect of con&s;ider|able gain, or there is no relation by kindred blood, or the per&s;on is capable of making &s;ome defence:&mdash; but in this murder of your's, there is none of the&s;e things to excu&s;e you. You are guilty of a mo&s;t horrid, mon&s;trous, and unnatural crime.</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible that per&s;ons in your &s;ituation, need a more &s;kilfull hand than I am to deal with them; yet as you are one of the precious &s;ouls committed to my charge, and de&s;ired that I &s;hould &s;peak to you upon this occa&s;ion; I mu&s;t be allowed to &s;peak the truth to you, and act the part of an hone&s;t dying man, who mu&s;t give an account to the JUDGE of quick and dead as well as you. Therefore when I plainly &s;et your &s;ins before you, believe, that I mean not to reproach you, but &s;eek your eternal good.&mdash; My earne&s;t de&s;ire is now in this la&s;t important hour
<PB N="20" REF="020955_0018_0FB14D0793DFB138">
that you may be truly &s;en&s;ible of your &s;ins, brought to true repentance, and through the merits of CHRIST obtain forgivene&s;s. You mu&s;t con&s;ider that by na|ture you are a &s;inner prone to iniquity, and, that your life has been exceedingly wicked. <HI>You have ca&s;t off fear, and have re&s;trained prayer before GOD&mdash;You have &s;et at nought his coun&s;els, and would none of his reproofs.</HI> You have been exceedingly fond of profane, wicked company, and rejected GOD. You have been fond of entertaining GOD's enemies, but would not enter|tain him. You have hardened your heart againn&s;t the LORD JESUS, who has given you repeated calls and warnings; urged you by the calls of the go&s;pel, mini&s;ters, friends, and providences; to turn from your evil ways and not die. Although you have been frequently called, and urged, yet you would not come unto CHRIST that you might have life. Re|bellion again&s;t GOD, has been the delight of your &s;oul. What abominable uncleanne&s;s and whoredom, have you been guilty of? and to hide this awful wicked|ne&s;s, what horrid lies have you told in denying re|peatedly that you was in a &s;tate of pregnancy, ju&s;t before the birth of your child? But the horrid wickedne&s;s of whoredom and lying, were not &s;uffi|cient for you; to the&s;e you have added the crying &s;in of murder repeatedly. You mu&s;t con&s;ider that in all your wickedne&s;s you have hated GOD, and been fighting again&s;t Him. GOD has been good to you, told you the truth, and be&s;towed numberle&s;s ble&s;&s;ings upon you. In the day of your di&s;tre&s;s, has repeat|edly helped you, and u&s;ed ble&s;&s;ed means with you to reclaim you from &s;in, and deliver you from the wrath to come. But you cared for none of his mer|cies, hated him without a cau&s;e, and would not have <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to rule over you.

right towards you. O then unle&s;s you now repent, are deeply humbled for your &s;ins, and fly to the LORD JESUS by faith; <HI>what will you do when GOD ari&s;eth up, and when he vi&s;iteth what will you an&s;wer? Can your hands be &s;trong or your heart endure when GOD &s;hall deal with you?</HI> Very great &s;inners may repent and turn to GOD, and he will have mercy on them. As great &s;inners as you have had a true &s;en&s;e of their &s;ins, been deeply humbled before God, cryed to him with a broken heart, and obtained forgivene&s;s. GOD is ready to hear prayer. The &s;acrifices of a broken heart he will not de&s;pi&s;e. There is forgivene&s;s and plenteous redemption, for tho&s;e who will repent and give them&s;elves to the LORD JESUS. Your &s;ins are not too great to be forgiven. Although you have lived in dreadful wickedne&s;s, yet the door of mercy is not &s;hut again&s;t you: for GOD now calls upon you to come to him that you may have life. O then let not a moment be lo&s;t. Lay a&s;ide your enmity again&s;t GOD immediately&mdash;be reconciled to him&mdash;fight again&s;t him no longer&mdash;lift your &s;oul to him in humble pen|itent groans. The Lord will hear from <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, and through the infinite merits of the glorious RE|DEEMER who died on the accur&s;ed tree; you may have an entrance admini&s;tered to you in the kingdom of Glory. <HI>The Lord Je&s;us came into the world to &s;ave &s;in|ners&mdash;He &s;uffered the ju&s;t for the unju&s;t that he might bring us to God.</HI> If then, you believe in him, give your&s;elf to him humbly, penitently and &s;incerely, you &s;hall not peri&s;h but have everla&s;ting life. Love the Lord JESUS CHRIST in &s;incerity, and you need not fear. We read of a woman in the go&s;pel, notoriou&s;ly wicked and vile; who came to our Lord with a humble heart; weeping and mourning for her &s;ins; and wa&s;hed his feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head. The Lord had mercy on

her, and granted pardon. She became a new creature, loved the Lord much and hated &s;in exceedingly. Some of the wick|ed Jews, who crucified the LORD of Glory, were brought to repentance, became the real friends of GOD, and were forgiven. The thief upon the cro&s;s became a new creature in his la&s;t mo|ments, and the Lord &s;aid to him, this day &s;halt thou be with me in paradi&s;e.

<P>A few words to this great a&s;&s;embly, &s;hall conclude the di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>What a melancholy &s;cene is now opened before you. You plainly &s;ee, that &s;in brings di&s;tre&s;s, and that wickedne&s;s over|throweth the &s;inner. Let me entreat you all to take warning by the awful &s;pectacle pre&s;ented before you. Be afraid of &s;in, and a life of ungodline&s;s. If you do that which is evil you may well be afraid; for the ruler beareth not the &s;word in vain;&mdash;for he is the mini&s;ter of GOD, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil. It is dangerous to venture upon tho&s;e &s;ins, which are called not &s;o great as others: for &s;ins are all linked together like a chain, which leads to temporal and eternal di&s;|tre&s;s. Take warning from what is pre&s;ented before you this day&punc; to avoid the &s;in of uncleanne&s;s. We &s;ee from plain facts <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;in is very dangerous, and God-provoking. 'Twas <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> led the poor pri&s;oner before us, to murder, and now &s;he mu&s;t die. She is not alone, for many others have been ruin|ed by this kind of wickedne&s;s. Many awful in&s;tances we have of late of per&s;ons being led on to death by the &s;in of unclean|ne&s;s and whoredom. Not long &s;ince a woman was executed in this town for murder, which was brought on by whoredom.&mdash; Within about a week after the unhappy pri&s;oner before us commit|ed the &s;in of murder; in the &s;ame town, an unclean and whori&s;h woman was led on by this abominable wickedne&s;s, to murder her&s;elf: deliberately, de&s;ignedly, without hope of any mercy&punc; and without de&s;iring the good wi&s;hes or prayers of any friend whatever. Some unclean per&s;ons may feel &s;ecure and uncon|cerned, becau&s;e they never had any thoughts of committing murder:&mdash;but let me tell &s;uch per&s;ons; that tho&s;e who have un|done them&s;elves by going from uncleanne&s;s to murder; were once in the depth of &s;ecurity, being under no fearful apprehen|&s;ions of committing murder:&mdash;yet they plunged into this wick|edne&s;s and peri&s;hed. The truth is, a holy GOD is &s;o angry

Let all parents take warning from the example before them; and &s;ee, that they are faithful in holding up light and truth before their children, and that they cea&s;e not to warn them from every evil practice. How much are all parents con|cerned to &s;et good examples before their children, and admini&s;|ter to them the mo&s;t u&s;eful in&s;tructions? Parents &s;hould inure their children to &s;ubjection, and obedience, and endeavour to in&s;til into their minds, an abhorrence of every evil practice.&mdash; How many children are undone for the want of good examples, good government and in&s;tructions from their parents? Who can de&s;cribe the feelings which you who are parents would have&punc; if a child of yours was in the melancholy &s;ituation of the pri&s;on|er now before us?
