<Q>WHEN THE RIGHTEOUS ARE IN AUTHORITY, THE PEOPLE REJOICE; BUT WHEN THE WICK|ED BEARETH RULE, THE PEOPLE MOURN.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE preacher con&s;iders it to be the &s;pecial de&s;ign of our pre&s;ent meeting in this place (according to common u&s;age, and the laudable example of our pious Ance&s;tors) to &s;eek the di|vine influence and direction in the important concerns of the day&mdash;to expre&s;s our grateful and devout prai&s;es for the ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;ings of go|vernment&mdash;to implore the divine ble&s;&s;ing upon our civil magi&s;trates in the di&s;charge of the du|ties of their &s;everal departments&mdash;and to medi|tate on &s;uch &s;ugge&s;tions from the oracles of truth, as may be pertinent to &s;uch an occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>THEREFORE he &s;hall hope to have acquitted him&s;elf to the &s;atisfaction of this numerous and re&s;pectable a&s;&s;embly in the part a&s;&s;igned him, if pur|&s;uant to the line of his own mini&s;terial character,
<PB N="6" REF="021360_0005_0FB33F4B1E719828">
he &s;hall offer &s;uch religious con&s;iderations, as may be thought proper for the bu&s;ine&s;s of the day; though he &s;hould avoid political di&s;qui&s;i|tions&mdash;though he &s;hould not decide in matters of controver&s;y; or dictate in matters of &s;tate, or attempt to give instructions to politicians who are furni&s;hed with much better means of know|ledge, and mu&s;t be pre&s;umed to be already well informed, re&s;pecting the proper duties of their &s;tation.</P>
<P>WAVING therefore whatever might &s;avour of impertinency upon &s;uch &s;ubjecis, I would ob|&s;erve, that the &s;entiment contained in the words under con&s;ideration, is clearly this, that the &s;ub|jects of every government, however depraved, or in&s;en&s;ible they may be to &s;ome purpo&s;es, have u&s;ually an ability to di&s;cern the virtues or defects of their rulers&mdash;that they quickly feel the ad|vantages or embarra&s;&s;ments of a virtuous or vi|cious admini&s;tration, and u&s;ually di&s;cover their internal &s;entiments, by exhibiting external de|mon&s;trations of &s;orrow or joy.</P>
<P>THE Words &s;eem al&s;o to carry with them this further implication, that righteou&s;ne&s;s (which in the &s;criptures is u&s;ed to &s;ignify &s;incere piety, or the fear of God) makes an important part of
<PB N="7" REF="021360_0006_0FB33F4CF91F6DA8">
the character of a ruler. Yet there are many profe&s;&s;ors of chri&s;tianity, who, (not much to the honour of their profe&s;&s;ion) will &s;trenuou&s;ly main|tain, that between religion and politicks, there ought to be little or no connection&mdash;that an In|fidel or an Athei&s;t ought to &s;tand as fair a candi|date for the &s;uffrages of a people, as the pious man, or the exemplary chri&s;tian. Indeed it mu&s;t not be di&s;puted that per&s;ons of ability and ac|compli&s;hments, who act from no higher motives than tho&s;e of honour, popularity or ambition, are often improved by Divine Providence, to render very e&s;&s;ential &s;ervices to a community. But after all, mu&s;t it not be allowed, that &s;incere piety, the true fear of God, refines and exalts the character of the ruler? Doth not this firm and un&s;haken principle which ever directs his actions, give him a better foundation for the people's con|fidence? He act&s; from the pure&s;t motives&mdash;he meditates the noble&s;t actions &mdash;prompted by &s;o divine a principle, his &s;alutary influence, like the beams of the morning &s;un, di&s;per&s;eth the gloomy horrours of vice, tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion; and diffu&s;eth over the whole community, the ble&s;&s;|ings of light, joy, liberty and peace. Thus are the words of in&s;piration, "the &s;pirit of the Lord &s;pake by me, and his word was in my tongue;
<PB N="8" REF="021360_0007_0FB33F4FA335EA80">
the God of I&s;rael &s;aid; the rock of I&s;rael &s;pake to me, he that ruleth over men, mu&s;t be ju&s;t, rul|ing in the fear of God; and he &s;hall be like the light of the morning, when the &s;un ri&s;eth, even a morning without clouds; as the tender gra&s;s &s;pringing out of the earth by clear &s;hining after rain."</P>
<P>OUR &s;ubject naturally re&s;olves it&s;elf into the two following propo&s;itions by way of enquiry, viz.</P>
<P N="1">I. What evidence may be rea&s;onably expected from rulers, that they po&s;&s;e&s;s tho&s;e virtues which are the &s;ource of joy to the people?</P>
<P N="2">II. When a people may rea&s;onably expre&s;s their grief on account of the corruption or ill admini&s;|tration of rulers?</P>
<P>JOY and grief are human pa&s;s&s;ions, which are readily excited, and often very &s;rongly expre&s;&s;ed: and they are to be commended or blamed, ac|cording to the various cau&s;es whereby they are produced, and the mea&s;ure to which they extend. The body of a people, may not always judge right re&s;pecting the qualifications of their rulers; yet with proper means of information, they ge|nerally form a ju&s;t opinion: and the opinion
<PB N="9" REF="021360_0008_0FB33F511B6BF560">
which they form, is not to be holden in con|tempt: For no wi&s;e and good magi&s;trate will wi&s;h to hide his character from the view of the people, or refu&s;e to give them the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible evidence of his integrity and virtue.</P>
<P>RULERS therefore in the legi&s;lative depart|ment, ought to enact laws which are well calcu|lated to &s;uppre&s;s vice, and puni&s;h the tran&s;gre&s;|&s;or. The laws of men have often a more imme|diate influence upon mankind, than the laws of God; becau&s;e human penalties, though not more certain, yet are expected to be more im|mediately inflicted. This makes it nece&s;&s;ary that rulers &s;hould pay the utmo&s;t attention to the enacting good laws; for without the&s;e the community can never be &s;afe; vice mu&s;t reign and triumph, virtue be unprotected and de|pre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>RULERS in the executive department, ought to &s;ee that good laws be well executed; for to what purpo&s;e doth it prove to enact the mo&s;t ex|cellent laws, with the proper penalties, when the&s;e penalties are never to be inflicted, nor the laws carried into execution? When the bolde&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors may bid defiance to the laws of ju&s;|tice,
<PB N="10" REF="021360_0009_0FB33F52CCB30D88">
and flatter them&s;elves with impunity? To indulge the violators of law, with frequent in|&s;tances of impunity&mdash;to make it ea&s;y for them to evade public ju&s;tice, has always a tendency to de&s;troy the influence of the magi&s;trate, and bring government it&s;elf, into a &s;tate of contempt. When the guilty e&s;cape, the number of offenders is quickly found to increa&s;e: But when the laws are held &s;acred, and their penalties inflicted, the authority of the magi&s;trate is e&s;tabli&s;hed, his per&s;on re&s;pected, and the government &s;evered.</P>
<P>RULERS are obliged to do ju&s;tice, not only in re&s;pect to the laws, but in re&s;pect to the &s;ubjects; and they are to enforce the execution of them, (unle&s;s where &s;ome particular rea&s;ons of &s;tate may require a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, or omi&s;&s;ion) in order to make the be&s;t compen&s;ation that may be, for the injury of the offence. The neglect: of puni&s;h|ment ju&s;tly merited, is often the cau&s;e of God's heavy judgments upon a people. The Benja|mites refu&s;ed to do ju&s;tice upon the man who had occa&s;ioned the death of the Levite's Concu|bine; multitudes of them were &s;lain in battle, their cities were laid in a&s;hes, and their whole tribe almo&s;t extingui&s;hed. To puni&s;h great and notorious acts of inju&s;tice, is called in &s;crip|ture,
<PB N="11" REF="021360_0010_0FB33F5D4246EE78">
"to put away evil from the land;" be|cau&s;e to this purpo&s;e the &s;word is put into the hands of rulers; and they bear the &s;word in vain who refu&s;e to protect their people. I am &s;peak|ing in general of the neglect to put good and whole&s;ome laws into execution, without having reference to particular in&s;tances; for &s;urely not to puni&s;h an offence, is to encourage it, unle&s;s, as was &s;aid before, the indemnity is ju&s;tified by particular rea&s;ons of &s;tate; and will not be an inducement to others to commit the like offences. In all other ca&s;es, that &s;in which was per&s;onal at fir&s;t, becomes national, by the neglect of the go|vernment to puni&s;h or &s;uppre&s;s it. And it is certain that the impunity of the offender, is &s;pring of univer&s;al mi&s;chief&mdash;it is not owing to the publick magi&s;trate, if the be&s;t man in the com|munity is not as vicious as the wor&s;t.&mdash;A law had better be annihilated, than to exi&s;t with uni|ver&s;al contempt. And no good magi&s;trate will be an unconcerned &s;pectator, and &s;ee the righte|ous laws of the State openly violated; but recollect|ing the duty of his office, will endeavour to bring offenders to their merited puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>RULERS ought to furni&s;h the people with this further evidence of their virtue, that they are
<PB N="12" REF="021360_0011_0FB33F6053A69BF0">
friendly to religion among their people, and u&s;e their influence and authority to uphold and pro|mote it. Religious wor&s;hip and order main|tained among a people, hath a mo&s;t &s;alutary effect upon their morals; it promotes vital piety, and due obedience to the laws of God and man. Rulers therefore &s;hould, by their exam|ple and authority, encourage the wor&s;hip of God, and &s;ee that it is maintained with dignity and reputation. For in this the glory of the great Supreme, and the be&s;t intere&s;t of men are joint|ly concerned, which are the great de&s;igns of the providential government of God in the world. It is by no means beneath the dignity of the greate&s;t magi&s;trate or monarch on earth, to yield the mo&s;t profound &s;ubjection to God, and pay homage to the Redeemer of men; nor to con|&s;ecrate them&s;elves, their power and authority, to his &s;ervice. God requires that they co-ope|rate with him in his de&s;igns to effect the be&s;t intere&s;t of his people&mdash;that they &s;hould be hearty friends to religion&mdash;devout wor&s;hippers of God&mdash;afford protection and encouragement to his &s;er|vants&mdash;that they &s;hould be patrons, and nur&s;ing Fathers to the church of Chri&s;t; and u&s;e their utmo&s;t endeavours to advance his kingdom. All which they may do without binding the
<PB N="13" REF="021360_0012_0FB33F678D90A030">
<HI>rights</HI> of con&s;cience, or exerting their authority to impo&s;e articles of faith, or modes of wor&s;hip; or enforcing the&s;e by penalties. Indeed &s;uch an exerci&s;e of power in a ruler would be to extend his commi&s;&s;ion beyond its limits, and to defeat its de&s;ign, which was to protect and pre&s;erve the <HI>rights</HI> of con&s;cience. The authority of rulers may be exerci&s;ed in matters of religion, &s;o far as to tolerate, encourage and &s;upport the wor|&s;hip of God in &s;ome form or other. The pleas of con&s;cience are frequently made to cover a de|&s;ign, and with intent only to form an excu&s;e from contributing to the &s;upport of religion, or upholding any form of &s;ocial wor&s;hip. In this ca&s;e the con&s;titutional power of government ought to be employed to di&s;appoint the di&s;s&s;em|bler, and enforce the <HI>rights</HI> of religion.</P>
<P>RIGHTEOUS rulers will al&s;o attend to the mo|rals of their people. Morality is an e&s;&s;ential part of religion, and intimately affects the very being of &s;ociety: and the magi&s;trate bears the &s;word in vain, who pays no attention to a matter which &s;o much concerns the peace of &s;ociety. He for|gets the de&s;ign of his commi&s;&s;ion, which is "to be a terror to evil doers, a prai&s;e to &s;uch as do well." A proper u&s;e of the authority ve&s;ted in
<PB N="14" REF="021360_0013_0FB33F6863E51640">
civil rulers is commonly effectual to check the rapid growth of impiety, to curb and re&s;train the vicious inclinations of men. The profana|tion of God's &s;acred name and wor&s;hip, as well as other enormous crimes again&s;t the laws of God and the community, will be duly noticed and puni&s;hed by the vigilant magi&s;trate. The happy effects produced by the vigilant care of rulers in promoting religion and virtue&mdash;and by their attention to the morals of the people&mdash;by their exertions for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;chools and &s;eminaries of in&s;truction, to form the morals of youth to virtue and religion, are hardly to be de&s;cribed. The community have had large ex|perience of the&s;e &s;alutary influences of the ma|gi&s;trate; and it is ardently to be wi&s;hed that the &s;en&s;e of their importance, might produce a &s;till greater degree of attention.</P>
<P>A PEOPLE may rea&s;onably expect to find in their rulers, a love and e&s;teem for virtuous men; and a di&s;po&s;ition to advance tho&s;e of that cha|racter to places of honour and tru&s;t. Thus the royal P&s;almi&s;t, "Mine eyes &s;hall be upon the faithful of the Land, that they may dwell with me;" "he that walketh in a perfect way, &s;hall &s;erve me".</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="021360_0014_0FB33F6E2C5A2810">SURELY a man ought not to be advanced to a &s;tation of honour merely becau&s;e he has a high &s;en&s;e of his own merit&mdash;nor becau&s;e he requires very great re&s;pect to be paid him&mdash;or becau&s;e he is able to flatter, and willing to do any thing for preferment&mdash;nor perhaps becau&s;e he may be u&s;ed as an in&s;trument to effect a particular pur|po&s;e&mdash;nor becau&s;e he is indigent, yet &s;corns to &s;ubmit to the duties of his proper calling&mdash;or becau&s;e he hath important friends to &s;olicit for him. Therefore good rulers will regard the &s;afety and true intere&s;t of the publick, and will let tho&s;e &s;hare their favours who be&s;t de&s;erve them; having regard both to their accompli&s;h|ments and virtues. They will commit no tru&s;t to a man devoid of principle, &s;en&s;ible that he would be likely to oppo&s;e every good purpo&s;e, as he who hates to be reformed, will hinder re|formation. The unprincipled per&s;on is never to be tru&s;ted; for the mo&s;t trifling con&s;ideration he will betray his tru&s;t, and make u&s;e of his power and influence to &s;ubvert the government that gave them. The frequent in&s;tances of this nature which have happened, furni&s;h matter of caution to every government, re&s;pecting the &s;er|vants they employ, and what characters they tru&s;t, with &s;uch powers as they have a con&s;titu|tional
<PB N="16" REF="021360_0015_0FB33F709A379410">
right to confer. Tho&s;e who are &s;tranger&s; to a principle of virtue and con&s;cience, and who contemn the laws of God, will not he&s;itate to trample upon the laws of men, whenever it an|&s;wers any &s;ini&s;ter purpo&s;e of their own. But the man of virtue will be ready to &s;acrifice every private con&s;ideration, that he may promote the intere&s;t of his country, and di&s;charge the duties of his tru&s;t with fidelity and &s;ucce&s;s. He will hazard both reputation and life, as the ca&s;e may be, in &s;upport of the dignity of government, and the honour of the laws. Such an one will be proof again&s;t the evil in&s;inuations of the de&s;ign|ing and crafty; and both in publick and private will bear te&s;timony again&s;t faction, &s;edition, and every evil work. Such characters therefore, will be in great e&s;timation with righteous rulers.</P>
<P>IT is not degrading the character of righteous rulers to pay a decent and candid attention to the complaints of their &s;ubjects, expre&s;&s;ed in a decent manner; but it is &s;uch an evidence of their virtue as may excite a peoples' joy. Ru|lers derive their authority from the people, and they cannot &s;uppo&s;e them&s;elves elevated beyond the reach of their addre&s;&s;es or applications. They hold their offices for a &s;hort term, after which,
<PB N="17" REF="021360_0016_0FB33F7236BD0408">
they mu&s;t &s;tand upon a level with their &s;ubject&s;. Tho&s;e who are worthy of the honour, and who accept their election with proper view, will be de&s;irous to know the particular &s;tate and circum|&s;tances of their &s;ubjects, that they may be under the greater advantage to &s;ub&s;erve their intere&s;t. They will therefore pay a particular regard to their complaints, and as far as they can (con&s;i&s;t|ently with the intere&s;t, reputation and &s;afety of the commonwealth) afford them relief: or a&s;|&s;ign a &s;atisfactory rea&s;on why &s;uppo&s;ed grievances are not redre&s;&s;ed; and convince the people that their want of &s;ucce&s;&s; in their applications to go|vernment, is not owing to want of &s;ympathy and affection; but becau&s;e their petitions are income|patible with the intere&s;t of the &s;tate. Such at|tention paid to the &s;uppo&s;ed grievances of &s;ub|jects, naturally procures affection and confidence, and &s;eldom fails of e&s;tabli&s;hing &s;uch rulers' in|tere&s;t in the hearts of a grateful people. It di&s;|po&s;eth their &s;ubjects to pay to them all due &s;ub|jection and honour, according to the in&s;pired Apo&s;tle, "not for wrath, but for con&s;cience &s;ake;" and to do it from intere&s;t, inclination and choice. Thus will they become the joy of their &s;ubject, and the terror of their foes. As the wi&s;e man a&s;&s;erts, "when the righteous are
<PB N="18" REF="021360_0017_0FB33F739F7BD080">
in authority the people rejoice."&mdash;They will en|joy peculiar &s;atisfaction to &s;ee per&s;ons of known virtue and integrity promoted in the govern|ment, and the admini&s;tration put into the hands of &s;uch, as both under&s;tand in what manner to u&s;e their power; and are di&s;po&s;ed to u&s;e it with equity and moderation. This will have a ten|dency to conciliate the e&s;teem, and procure the veneration of the people; one and all will be ready to unite their influence to render their ad|mini&s;tration ea&s;y and happy.</P>
<P>LET us now attend to the &s;econd que&s;tion, viz. When a people may reasonably. expre&s;s their grief on account of the corruption or ill admi|ni&s;tration of rulers?</P>
<P>BY contra&s;ting the former character, we have the an&s;wer. For if a people have rea&s;on to re|joice when their rulers give the mo&s;t plenary evidence of a righteous and faithful admini&s;tra|tion, by &s;uppre&s;&s;ing and puni&s;hing vice, encou|raging virtue&mdash;protecting the virtuous, and re|ligious, promoting &s;uch to office, and cheri&s;hing a fellow feeling of the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the communi|ty at large, they cannot forbear to mourn and weep when they ob&s;erve in their rulers, a rever&s;e
<PB N="19" REF="021360_0018_0FB33F7630AC3480">
of this excellent character. For as we have be|fore remarked, mankind have not lo&s;t all &s;en&s;e of the excellency of virtue&mdash;they retain &s;uch an idea of goodne&s;s, that they are willing to &s;ee it exemplified in the character of their rulers, even when they find it not in them&s;elves. They have an exalted opinion of it in others, however aver&s;e they maybe from admitting its influence in their own practice.</P>
<P>NOTHING occa&s;ions more grief to a people than to find their rulers like Omri, the I&s;raeliti&s;h king, making ungodly &s;tatutes&mdash;when mi&s;chief is e&s;tabli&s;hed by laws, and the people enjoined to enforce them under &s;evere penalties. God has oftentimes permitted the rulers of a people to be &s;o devoid of all &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice and equity, as to frame the mo&s;t pernicious &s;tatutes, which in their operation, have been productive of infinite mi&s;|chiefs: and which, with tolerable di&s;cernment, might have been ea&s;ily fore&s;een. When therefore a people have the extreme misfortune to have rulers of &s;uch a de&s;cription, they can expect no|thing from them; but &s;uch admini&s;tration as will be the occa&s;ion of &s;orrow and mourning as long as it &s;hall continue.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="021360_0019_0FB33F7781B43BC8">AND hence originates that di&s;honour and con|tempt in which the rulers of a people are &s;ome|times holden by their &s;ubjects. When a people de&s;pi&s;e their magi&s;trates, contemn their govern|ment, profane the wor&s;hip of God, and in&s;ult the mini&s;ter&s; of religion, we are ready to con&s;i|der &s;uch conduct as the effect of &s;ome weakne&s;s in government, or want of virtue in the magi&s;|trate. But when a people di&s;cover a di&s;po&s;ition in their rulers, to &s;ubvert the principles of na|tural ju&s;tice, and injure them of their ju&s;t rights under colour of law; is it matter of &s;urprize, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of human nature and pa&s;&s;ions, to &s;ee them meditating to reform government, and to procure deliverance from &s;uch intolera|ble oppre&s;&s;ion?</P>
<P>ADD to this, when the great political characters who ought to be the mo&s;t exemplary per&s;ons, are without a &s;en&s;e of religion&mdash;&s;hew no proper reverence of authority, or regard for the church of Chri&s;t; do not act under the influence of con&s;cience, or the fear of God; this is a &s;uffici|ent cau&s;e for publick mourning and lamentati|on! As &s;uch per&s;ons are greater in power and influence, &s;o much greater is the calamity of the people; for they are not only unhappy by natu|ral

and immediate con&s;equences, but are thereby expo&s;ed to the more &s;evere judgments of God, which will undoubtedly &s;ucceed. When ini|quity or irreligion is "framed into a law," and God mu&s;t be di&s;honoured, or the rights of his people invaded, this &s;urely is a &s;ource of grief to every good man.</P>
<P>NO injury &s;o great, no iniquity &s;o much to be abhorred as a wicked law, therefore it concerns every &s;tate to &s;ee that their laws are righteous and ju&s;t. And whenever any Legi&s;lature, find on a review, that laws have been pa&s;&s;ed, though perhaps by inadvertency, which de&s;erve that de|&s;cription, ju&s;tice to God and man, demands that they be in&s;tantly repealed. That rulers &s;hould frame laws notoriou&s;ly unju&s;t, deprive innocent citizens of their liberty, &s;ubject them to grievous penalties, for no cau&s;e but to gratify their own evil pa&s;&s;ions, is &s;uch a direct violation of the laws of God, and the rights of men, as mu&s;t fill every &s;en&s;ible heart with grief and horrour. Every citizen of every de&s;cription, as he contributes an equal &s;hare towards the &s;upport of government, hath a right to expect equal ju&s;tice and protect|tion; unle&s;s by &s;ome crime or errors in his con|duct, he hath forfeited that right; and when
<PB N="22" REF="021360_0021_0FB33F87759D2C88">
the right is denied, unle&s;s on account of &s;ome defect of his own, he hath certainly a good cau&s;e to complain. And when cau&s;es of complaint, by the admini&s;tration of unprincipled and tyranni|cle magi&s;trates, became general, and perhaps al|mo&s;t univer&s;al, the effect&s; will al&s;o be as exten|&s;ive as the cau&s;es; little be&s;ide expre&s;&s;ions of la|mentation, and &s;orrow, will be &s;een or heard through the whole community.</P>
<P>THE people have equal rea&s;on to mourn when wicked men are preferred by their rulers, and di&s;tingui&s;hed by their &s;pecial favours. In times of confu&s;ion and degeneracy, wicked and de&s;ign|ing men, obtain promotion; and oftimes &s;uch person&s; are entru&s;ted with the more important concerns of the public, who were never po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of virtue and economy, &s;ufficient to tran&s;act their own. Hence the public are deprived of the abi|lities of &s;uch in the Commonwealth, who are per&s;ons of the be&s;t under&s;tanding, and the great|e&s;t wi&s;dom. This is a &s;ure con&s;equence of the promotion of wicked men, that many of the mo&s;t valuable characters, retire into-ob&s;curity, and decline any part in government. As Solo|mon ob&s;erves, "when the wicked ri&s;e, men hide
<PB N="23" REF="021360_0022_0FB33F8A6588F688">
them&s;elves, but when they peri&s;h the righteous increa&s;e." Flatterers and para&s;ites are the men who find favour with a wicked admini&s;tration, but &s;uch as govern their lives by the maxims of religion, and the laws of virtue, if not; wholly ne|glected, will commonly be di&s;po&s;ed to excu&s;e them&s;elves. If they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of large proper|ty, they will &s;oon find that their exertions in favour of virtue, will render their property in&s;e|cure&mdash;have they great talents and abilities, they will &s;oon find that to u&s;e them in favour of vir|tue, will be to expo&s;e them to the depredations and per&s;ecutions of a wicked, lawle&s;s power&mdash;do they exert them&s;elves in favour of the public in|tere&s;t, and to deliver their country from embar|ra&s;&s;ments and di&s;tre&s;&s;es, they find that their vir|tuous efforts, do but expo&s;e them to the fury of a wicked admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>HAPPY is it for a land, when good men in|crea&s;e, and more happy when their talents are exerci&s;ed for the good of the community. "But when the wicked ri&s;e, a man is hidden." They who are void of principle, dete&s;t every thing which is &s;acred, as far as they have power they thru&s;t good men into ob&s;curity, and they are
<PB N="24" REF="021360_0023_0FB33F8BC371C278">
forced to ab&s;cond for their own &s;afety. Tho&s;e who are lo&s;t to all &s;en&s;e of virtue, duty or moral obligation, will improve their power to the wor&s;t purpo&s;es; and by this means they deba&s;e their character in the e&s;timation of the people, who feel them&s;elves truly mi&s;erable under their op|pre&s;&s;ive admi&s;tration. They cannot but mourn to &s;ee their rulers &s;o devoid of the principles of virtue, while they behold the melancholy effects of their wickedne&s;s, wherever they turn their eyes&mdash;they cannot but mourn when they antici|pate the event of &s;uch unrighteous mea&s;ures of government, and the mi&s;erable con&s;equences which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be produced. Sad indeed is the condition of that people, who have ju&s;t oc|ca&s;ion for &s;uch complaints! They cannot but give their atte&s;tation to the truth of the ob&s;er|vation, in the text, "when the wicked beareth rule the people mourn."</P>

<HEAD>IMPROVEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>A very natural reflection, which may be made Upon the &s;ubject is this, viz. That virtue is ho|nourable, and adds an eminent lu&s;tre to the re|putation of a ruler. And in this view particu|larly that it is prai&s;ed and admired by tho&s;e that love it not, that it is honoured by the followers
<PB N="25" REF="021360_0024_0FB33F8D2C013688">
and family of vice&mdash;that it forces glory out of &s;hame, honour from contempt&mdash;that it recon|ciles men to the fountain of honour, the Almigh|ty God, "who will ever honour tho&s;e that ho|nour him." Certain it is, that religion &s;ub|&s;erves even our temporal purpo&s;es; no great end of &s;tate, can be well attained without it; even ambition it&s;elf often &s;eeks to derive its &s;up|port from a pretence of religion. "If a new opinion be commenced, and the author would make a party, and draw di&s;ciples after him, at lea&s;t he mu&s;t be thought to be religious." This is a demon&s;tration how great an in&s;trument or means of reputation, piety and religion are. Now if only the pretence will do us &s;uch good offi|ces among&s;t men, the reality will do us much more, be&s;ides the advantages we may hope to receive from the divine benediction. The power of godline&s;s, will certainly do more than the form alone.</P>
<P>NO one it is pre&s;umed, can infer from any thing which hath been &s;ugge&s;ted, that obedience is not due to rulers from their &s;ubjects, although they might have rea&s;on to be &s;u&s;picious of their mor|al character, and although there be many things in their admini&s;tration, which might be a ju&s;t cau&s;e of grief and mourning. The obedience we
<PB N="26" REF="021360_0025_0FB33F96E04C3BF8">
owe to magi&s;trates, differs e&s;&s;entially from that which we owe to God. We ought to obey God with our under&s;tanding, and will, that is, weought to obey him intelligently and freely; our obedi|ence re&s;ulting from a &s;en&s;e of the rectitude of his precepts. But &s;uch obedience to human laws is not always required; for we may &s;ometimes doubt of the fitne&s;s or equity of them. For &s;o long as magi&s;rates are liable to error, though it be highly nece&s;&s;ary, con&s;idering our&s;elves as mem|bers of &s;ociety, that we conform our own actions to their laws; yet it is not always our duty to believe that their laws are mo&s;t &s;alutary or con|venient, becau&s;e human laws may be &s;ometimes otherwi&s;e. But our &s;ocial obligations require us to be &s;ubject to laws which we may think very inconvenient, provided they be not &s;inful in them&s;elves. It would be happy if inferiors would not employ them&s;elves too much in di&s;|puting the policy and prudence of their rulers, and the propriety of their laws. We are not to obey laws, which cannot be obeyed without con|&s;cience; but an action may be wrong in re&s;pect of the per&s;on commanding it, and yet innocent in re&s;pect of the per&s;on who executes the com|mand.</P>

It is generally true, that &s;ubjects are obliged to yield obedience to the laws of the State, without que&s;tioning the policy of them, if they are not apparently repugnant to the laws of God: Whereas to oppo&s;e the ruler, on any other principle than this, tends to introduce con|fu&s;ion into &s;ociety; weakens the bands of govern|ment; de&s;troys the authority and influence of rulers, and is in danger to i&s;&s;ue in the &s;ubver|&s;ion of the State.</P>

Suffer me to add, that he who is confident of his own under&s;tand|ing (and who is more &s;o than he who thinks him&s;elf wi&s;er than the laws?) needs no other temp|ter, than him&s;elf, to pride and vanity, which are the natural parents of di&s;obedience. The laws which are enacted by wi&s;e and ju&s;t legi&s;la|tors, are not dictated by an arbitrary will, but re&s;ult from the principles of rea&s;on and ju&s;tice. They are rea&s;onable and good in them&s;elves; they are calculated not to &s;ub&s;erve any &s;ini&s;ter purpo&s;es, or private views, but to advance and &s;ecure the happine&s;s of men. Whenever it happens otherwi&s;e, the legi&s;lators are tyrannical, and the government oppre&s;&s;ive: Statutes contra|dictory and incon&s;i&s;tent are to be expected, and even &s;uch as might invert the order of things, and &s;ub&s;titute vice, in the room of virtue.

<P>YOUR Excellency's early and intimate acquaint|tance with the &s;ituation of the Commonwealth, and a thorough knowledge of the con&s;titution particularly, render you a more able in&s;trument in the hands of Providence, and give you peculiar advantages for guiding our publick affairs with a &s;kilful hand.

And they will be encouragers of peace or licentiou&s;ne&s;s, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, as they &s;hall find countenance or encouragement from your conver&s;ation and example.</P>
<P>THE eyes of the people are upon their rulers, and upon you, Gentlemen, in particular, to hear your &s;entiments in the mo&s;t critical ca&s;es, and di&s;putable &s;ubjects; and may expect from you &s;uch things as do not fall within your de|partment. In &s;uch a ca&s;e, Gentlemen, you will doubtle&s;s recollect the powers ve&s;ted in you by your commi&s;&s;ion, and keep within its limits.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, Gentlemen, I would not pre&s;ume to go out of my line, to dictate to you any mea|&s;ures
<PB N="39" REF="021360_0038_0FB33FC25AB0DED8">
of a civil or political nature; your wi&s;dom and good &s;en&s;e do not require this from me.</P>
<P>PERMIT me to &s;ay, that as magi&s;tracy is of God's ordination, you have a right to expect and demand due re&s;pect and obedience from our &s;ubjects. And we "ought for ever to con|&s;ider it as a peculiar favour of Heaven, that Chri&s;tians are promoted to be rulers and judges among Chri&s;tians."</P>
<P>IT belongs to your department, Gentlemen, hot only to enact righteous laws, but according to your con&s;titutional department, to judge righteous judgment&mdash;to plead the cau&s;e of the oppre&s;sed; to relieve the fatherle&s;s and widow, and him that hath no helper; to render to every one according to the ju&s;tice of his cau&s;e which &s;hall be brought before you. You will remem|ber, gentlemen, that your commi&s;&s;ion is limited by God. He who has dignified you above your brethern, hath limited your powers by his holy word. You are not authori&s;ed to obey the dictates of pa&s;&s;ion or arbitrary will, but to act agreeably to the revealed will of God. When Jo&s;hua was appointed chief magi&s;trate, God in&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lled him in his powers, and put the law into his hand &s;aying.
<PB N="40" REF="021360_0039_0FB33FC56F08EC90">
"this book of the law &s;hall not depart out of thy mouth." Look then gentlemen upon the copy that is before you, then upon the commi&s;|&s;ion which is given you. And as you are God's vicegerents to carry on the affairs of his king|dom on earth, you will take your directions from his word, and imbibe his &s;pirit.</P>
<P>WE being &s;en&s;ible, gentlemen:, that your work is difficult, and that you have an arduous ta&s;k to cure all the di&s;orders of the political body, re&s;tore harmony and peace, and to unite the jarring inter|e&s;ts of parties, and fix them to one common cen|ter, do mo&s;t &s;incerely commend you to that God, "who giveth wi&s;dom to the wi&s;e, and under|&s;tanding to the prudent". Ye your&s;elves can|not but be &s;en&s;ible of your need of divine aid and direction: "In all your ways then acknow|ledge God, and he &s;hall direct your paths." Let a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of human weakne&s;s prompt you, to repair to the fountain of light and knowledge, and may you improve them, when obtained, to the honor of God and the good of your con&s;titu|ents. And may you obtain the divine pre&s;ence and ble&s;&s;ing in the faithful di&s;charge of the duties of your department during your whole admini&s;tra|tion. And as a reward for your &s;ervices, may you
<PB N="41" REF="021360_0040_0FB33FCB42E70EA8">
be honoured as the political &s;aviours of this people, and meet their mo&s;t cordial approbation with great rejoicing. And more e&s;pecially may you reap the effects of a &s;erene and acquiting con|&s;cience. And having &s;erved your generation according to the will of God, may you partici|pate the joys of the ble&s;&s;ed forever.</P>
<P>THIS whole a&s;&s;embly of God's people will per|mit me to make the &s;ugge&s;tion, that virtue in rulers is not more nece&s;&s;ary than in the body of the citizens collectively. The more virtuous the community, the le&s;s is the occa&s;ion for the exer|ci&s;e of the gifts and graces of tho&s;e in authority, and the le&s;s is the danger of injury from rulers if they were ill di&s;po&s;ed. When we are tempted to complain of our rulers and feel anxious lea&s;t they &s;hould betray their tru&s;t, and expo&s;e the people to the lo&s;s of their liberties, we may re|collect that a virtuous people cannot be en&s;laved, and that it would be impracticable for rulers to in|volve their citizens in calamities that are grievous and mournful, if there were not a large propor|tion of abandoned and unprincipled men to give countenance to, and aid them in their evil de|&s;igns. And if a community are &s;o lo&s;t to a &s;en&s;e
<PB N="42" REF="021360_0041_0FB33FCCDF7ED5F0">
of their own inter&s;t, and &s;o regardle&s;s of their obligations to God and each other, as ju&s;tly to expo&s;e them&s;elves to the mo&s;t fatal injuries, who can declare that their calamity is unmerited?</P>
<P>THAT the admini&s;tration of civil rulers may be &s;uch as may occa&s;ion rejoicing, it becomes us not only to &s;olicit God's pre&s;ence with them and his ble&s;&s;ing upon them; but to demean our|&s;elves as good citizens, and remove all the em|barra&s;tments which may render it exce&s;&s;ively difficulty if not wholly impracticable, to do equal ju&s;tice in all ca&s;es.</P>
<P>IT cannot be denied but that a people may have &s;ometimes a mighty influence upon a righteous admini&s;tration, and procure &s;uch mea|&s;ures to be adopted as are fraught with matter for grief and mourning. But this evil ought not to be palmed upon our rulers. We ought, in &s;uch ca&s;es, as hone&s;t men, to reprobate our own conduct, and keep within our own pro|vince. There is not a greater mi&s;chief which can ba&s;al a people, than to be divided into fects and parties, either in re&s;pect to religion or civil policy. The con&s;equences are fatal to peace, harmony and order; and it is this, my friends,
<PB N="43" REF="021360_0042_0FB33FCE58FA7C48">
which renders our pre&s;ent &s;ituation very threat|ening.</P>
<P>On all accounts it is our intere&s;t, and we are bound in honour and con&s;cience faithfully to ad|here to, and vigorou&s;ly to pur&s;ue the &s;ame glo|rious cau&s;e. We are bound to unite our in|fluence that religion and righteou&s;ne&s;s may &s;pread and prevail&mdash;that practical piety and ho|line&s;s may be more vi&s;ible in our lives, and that the wor&s;hip of God in private and public, may ornament our &s;ociety, and that our own hearts e&s;pecially, may become a fit habitation for the holy &s;pirit.</P>
<P>TRUE piety in the hearts of men, will render them the be&s;t citizens. And both rulers and people are under the &s;ame divine laws, are &s;ub|ject to the &s;ame authority, encouraged and animated by the &s;ame motives, and favoured with the &s;ame example. It would be happy if their objects might be the &s;ame: and they were equally &s;tudious to promote the honor and glory of their common Lord.</P>
<P>LET us not forget that the &s;ame rules that will teach, and the &s;ame grace and integrity, that will di&s;po&s;e rulers to di&s;charge the duties of their office faithfully, are equally nece&s;&s;ry and ought to
<PB N="44" REF="021360_0043_0FB33FD359240CE8">
be equally regarded by tho&s;e whom God hath made &s;ubject to them:</P>
<P>AND that all oppo&s;ition to lawful authority, "is re&s;i&s;ting the ordinance of God," who hath made it our duty to be "&s;ubject not only for wrath, but for con&s;cience &s;ake."</P>
<P>AND let me &s;ugge&s;t, that as we make our reli|gious character our boa&s;t, and have &s;o oft made our appeal to Heaven, that we are God's people, and our cau&s;e the cau&s;e of God, we ought &s;trenu|ou&s;ly to endeavour to make the &s;incerity of this profe&s;&s;ion, more evident to the world; other|wi&s;e we &s;hall ju&s;tly de&s;rve the imputation of hav|ing our hearts and tongues at the greate&s;t remove from each other.</P>
<P>IT declarations entitled us to credit abroad, and even with Deity it&s;elf, our de&s;erts could hardly be compen&s;ated. But let us deal faithfully with our&s;elve&s; and confe&s;s our per&s;onal and national unworthine&s;&s;, if we expect God's forgivene&s;s and ble&s;&s;ing. And let us cultivate a principle of ju&s;|tice, of public &s;pirit, and benevolence in the com|munity; and live as the grace of God teacheth. Let us be &s;en&s;ible of the invaluable ble&s;&s;ings, which indulgent Heaven be&s;tows&mdash;and particu|larly,
<PB N="45" REF="021360_0044_0FB33FD76749F3F0">
that we enjoy the great advantage of civil government, by the continuance and &s;upport of which, we are, for the pre&s;ent, &s;ecure in our per|&s;ons and properties. And while we all affect to &s;eek a mild and equal government, may we unite our influence to &s;upport the &s;ame, that "in the peace thereof, we may have peace."</P>
<P>AND though we might be apprehen&s;ive that there were grievances which ought to be redre&s;&s;|ed, yet ought we to let a manly firmne&s;s and re|&s;olution be di&s;covered in pur&s;uing the paths of virtue till the object be obtained.</P>
<P>A people may be as criminal in adopting means of relief, as they can &s;uppo&s;e tho&s;e to be, who originated the cau&s;e of complaint. And while our conduct is &s;uch as it ought to be towards our rulers, and we &s;uitably addre&s;s them upon the &s;uject of public burdens, let us encourage our|&s;elves that they will feel our di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and ea&s;e our complaints.</P>
<P>LET us re&s;ume courage and hope for better times&mdash;when peace and good order &s;hall be es|tabli&s;hed upon a proper ba&s;is&mdash;when ju&s;tice &s;hall be impartially admini&s;tered&mdash;when friend&s;hip, brotherlv, love, and chri&s;tian fellow&s;hip, &s;hall be
<PB N="46" REF="021360_0045_0FB33FD9556B8158">
univer&s;al. When it &s;hall be reckoned an honor to be &s;incerely religious, and to be &s;ubjected to the rules of righteou&s;ne&s;s in all our tran&s;actions with men. When none but the virtuous &s;hall rule and judge the people of God, the admini&s;|tration of whom &s;hall greatly increa&s;e their joy and gladne&s;s.</P>
<P>THEN truly "ble&s;&s;ed is the people that know the joyful &s;ound; they &s;hall walk, O Lord, in the light of thy countenance. In thy name &s;hall they rejoice all the day, and thy righte|ou&s;ne&s;&s; &s;hall they be exalted. For thou art the glory of their &s;trength; and in thy favor our horn &s;hall be exalted. For the Lord is our de|fence, and the holy one I&s;rael is our King."</P>
