<ARGUMENT>
<P>[THIS little piece was written about the end of the winter 1793-4, on the occa&s;ion of a growing alarm of the yellow fever being again in Philadelphia. Fear began to &s;pread in the city&punc; and, had it extended to the members of the national legi&s;lature, &s;o as to have occa&s;ioned their removal from town, it would have been attended with con&s;iderable di&s;advantage to the public affairs. Copies were di&s;tributed among the gentlemen of congre&s;s, and to a few of the city. But it happened that &s;everal, who could not have been purpo&s;ely overlooked, did not receive any: and appli|cations have been made for copies when there were none left. To an&s;wer the&s;e, a few copies more, with notes, are &s;truck off.]</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>YELLOW FEVER.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>yellow fever,</HI> or tropical endemic cau&s;us, and the <HI>&s;mall pox,</HI> are inflammatory in the attack; and are communicated by &s;pecific contagion. The poi&s;on of the former, as it &s;eems, is conveyed di|rectly to the &s;tomach with the &s;aliva, or any thing &s;wallowed, and acts upon it, and upon the pylorus and duodenum, by corro&s;ion; which fir&s;t rai&s;ing an inflammation on the parts, the&s;e afterwards become gangrenous. This poi&s;on acts as other acrid poi&s;ons taken into the &s;tomach. The di&s;ea&s;e is a corro&s;ion of the &s;tomach, the pylorus, and the duodenum; all el&s;e of the complaints, are they more than &s;ymptoms con&s;equent of that corro&s;ion&punc;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See an account of di&s;&s;ections, page 9.</NOTE></P>
<P>The contagious poi&s;on of the <HI>&s;mall pox</HI> acts more like that infu&s;ed into the blood by the bite of poi&s;on|ous animals, which contaminates the ma&s;s.</P>
<P>The con&s;tituent parts of the&s;e poi&s;ons, or by what proce&s;s of nature they are generated, few pretend to know; and though &s;ome may fancy they know them, yet it is beyond the conjecture of mo&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="026684_0002_0FD15A2C55F736F8">Whil&s;t we are ignorant of the cau&s;e of the <HI>yellow fever</HI> and <HI>&s;mall pox,</HI> we may however admit that they are infectious, though not alike in all circum&s;tances.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The tropical endemic yellow fever is not always conta|gious. It exi&s;ts in the We&s;t India i&s;lands for years together without being notably &s;o. Strangers from northern climates are very liable to take it on their arrival there; and it goes hard with them. Their being &s;o very &s;u&s;ceptible, is owing more to their intemperance, and expo&s;ure to night air, dews and rains, than to contagion. After &s;ome number of years, it is u&s;hered in with aggravated circum&s;tances. It thus be|comes very contagious, and is a di&s;tinct and mo&s;t fatal di&s;ea&s;e. Such was the yellow fever in Philadelphia in 1793, and in the We&s;t Indies in 1793 and 1794. The milder or common yellow fever of the i&s;lands can never be conveyed to the con|tinent, becau&s;e it is not contagious, and the contagious kind &s;eldom exi&s;ts in the i&s;lands:&mdash;thence the long intervals of its appearance on this continent. All plagues have their periods. When the peculiar circum&s;tances that occa&s;ion or admit of the aggravation in the yellow fever give way, the di&s;ea&s;e becomes no longer contagious, but &s;inks into the common and le&s;s virulent tropical yellow fever. It is &s;aid, an <HI>exce&s;s</HI> of <HI>heat</HI> or of <HI>cold</HI> will de&s;troy certain di&s;ea&s;es. The dreaded Natolian plague (commonly called "<HI>The</HI> Plague") has ex|i&s;ted, at times, in the higher but mild latitudes, hitherto, without having ever originated any where el&s;e than in <HI>Na|tolia.</HI> It is often in northern Egypt and on the coa&s;t of Barbary: but it is &s;aid to be always carried thither from its <HI>Natolian</HI> &s;ource. M. <HI>Savery</HI> calls Con&s;tantinople and Smyrna the <HI>Foci</HI> of it. Was this kind of plague ever known to exi&s;t between the tropics? It has been carried to England, and other countries of heat and cold, where it raged. All the countries of its exi&s;tence are in the <HI>temperate climates.</HI> Did it ever exi&s;t in countries of continual heat? On the other hand, the yellow fever, in its virulent &s;tate, <HI>originates</HI> only within the tropics, the lower latitudes of perpetual heat: but it is of a nature to act in the higher latitudes, under a combination of certain peculiar circum&s;tances, when in|troduced from its native &s;ource. There mu&s;t be &s;uch a combination to produce and &s;upport the&s;e contagious and dreadful di&s;ea&s;es. Other circum&s;tances arre&s;t, and in the end annihilate them.</NOTE> The &s;mall pox may be communicated in all &s;tates of the air, but the yellow fever can exi&s;t only in a <HI>hot air,</HI> as hi&s;tories of it &s;how: and there are al&s;o &s;trong rea&s;ons for believing from tho&s;e hi&s;tories that <HI>fro&s;t</HI> kills the infectious matter of it, as &s;urely as it kills certain other exotics. Many people, in the time of the late epidemic in Philadelphia, looked for rain,
<PB N="3" REF="026684_0003_0FD15A2E78829550">
which they believed would be fatal to the infection.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Granada, "As the change to <HI>moi&s;ture</HI> was remark|ably great and &s;udden, much expectation was formed that the virulence of the infection would be done away or abated: but <HI>neither</HI> happened." Chi&s;holm.</NOTE> Others regarded not the coming of rain, otherwi&s;e than as it might be attended with or followed by <HI>cold</HI>; and they looked only for mere <HI>cold,</HI> whether attended with rain or not, becau&s;e hi&s;tories of this fever a&s;&s;ured them that <HI>cold</HI> had always been fatal to the infection. It is admitted that floods of rain, by diluting and wa&s;hing off the &s;tagnant putrid water of a low country, relieve from the remitting, the bilious, and the putrid fevers common to &s;uch countries.</P>
<P>Although the yellow fever originates in countries of perpetual <HI>heat,</HI> yet it may be brought from thence into this country of both cold and heat, as it hereto|fore has been: there are, however, two particulars e&s;pecially nece&s;&s;ary to that end; that it be in the <HI>peculiar air of a large town,</HI> and that the &s;ea&s;on be <HI>hot.</HI> It may well be pre&s;umed it cannot act, in this country at lea&s;t, but under this combination; becau&s;e it ne|ver yet has appeared on the continent, unattended
<PB N="4" REF="026684_0004_0FD15A2F9B974B20">
with tho&s;e circum&s;tances. If the matter of this con|tagion &s;uffers <HI>cold,</HI> it &s;uffers death; as may be col|lected from facts uniformly heretofore happening in this country. When it was in Charle&s;ton, S. C. in 1748, it received its death &s;troke from cold air on the fourteenth of October; and about the &s;ame time of October it lately experienced the like, on the change of air from an uncommon heat, for that &s;ea&s;on, to the proper degree of autumnal cold. The cool air, e&s;pecially at night, in the la&s;t week of September, 1793, produced &s;uch a change in the degree of infection and complaints of the &s;ick in Philadelphia, that the phy&s;icians expre&s;&s;ed an agree|able &s;urprize, on the great abatement of both: but the return of warm clo&s;e weather, with a &s;hift of wind from the <HI>northern</HI> quarters to the <HI>&s;outhern,</HI> in the beginning of October, gave &s;o fatal a malignancy to the di&s;ea&s;e, as occa&s;ioned more frequent deaths, for &s;ome days, even after the return of cooler wea|ther: but, it &s;eems it had generally effected too much to admit of recovery, of the <HI>then</HI> &s;ick, in any &s;tate of the air afterwards.</P>
<P>For &s;upporting the aforegoing principles, we need only be a&s;&s;ured that the yellow fever has never been communicated in country places or &s;mall towns on this continent; and that as often as it has been among&s;t us, it always appeared to be imported, always vani&s;hed in the cool &s;ea&s;on of autumn, and never recurred with the en&s;uing &s;ummer, nor until again u&s;hered in from the We&s;t Indies. Re|ports &s;ay indeed, that it has been taken in country places, in &s;ome few in&s;tances. But on inquiry, it appears there has been a want of knowledge to di&s;tingui&s;h the yellow fever from di&s;ea&s;es of the
<PB N="5" REF="026684_0005_0FD15A30D5D50510">
country, the &s;ymptoms being partly alike. In other in&s;tances, people have received the infection in Philadelphia, but have pretended they had not been in the city: others alarmed, have imagined they had it, when they have only had a little cold or common complaint, or mere apprehen&s;ion may have induced the &s;uppo&s;ition.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It &s;eems there &s;till is a &s;u&s;picion in &s;ome phy&s;icians, founded on the narrations of other people, that there were a few in&s;tances of the infection taken in country places. But to a&s;certain facts of this nature, and di&s;tingui&s;h them with accuracy, for a phy&s;ician to judge of them with certainty, is not very ea&s;y in common. Di&s;ea&s;es originating in or greatly affecting the &s;tomach, are attended with &s;ymptoms much alike, from the common intermittent to the yellow fever. Any thing corro&s;ive or acrimonious, acting forcibly on the coats of that bowel, mu&s;t immediately affect the nerves, which there abound, and readily communicate &s;en&s;ations to the very extremities. The beginning of the wor&s;t of the yellow fever has been taken, in Philadelphia, for only a cold or ob&s;tructed per&s;piration. Per&s;piration, by the bye, being refu&s;ed a pa&s;&s;age through its natural outlet, becomes depraved and even acrimonious. It then &s;oon affects the fibres and the nerves, and induces &s;pa&s;m (whether it be perceptible or not) attended with tremours, head-ach, hea|vine&s;s, re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, anxiety, pains, nau&s;ea or vomiting. If haply the per&s;pirable matter is into driven into the canal, it is thence di&s;charged in the character of diarrhoea. But, if its &s;timulous produces fixed &s;pa&s;m on the inte&s;tines, whil&s;t the pores of the &s;kin &s;till remain clo&s;ed, co&s;tivene&s;s then occurs, and the per&s;pirable matter is every way &s;hut up. It &s;eems, that from the &s;pa&s;m of the &s;tomach, extended, ari&s;es the co&s;tivene&s;s u&s;ual in the yellow fever; which remains, till recovery or putrefaction relea&s;es the fibres from the &s;pa&s;m. When putrefaction happens to effect this&mdash;then it is that by|&s;tanders become a&s;toni&s;hed on &s;eeing the &s;pontaneous di&s;|charges, which are immen&s;e, in fluids that had been accu|mulating, and were impri&s;oned by the &s;pa&s;m now &s;uddenly let loo&s;e on an entire lo&s;s of tone in the fibres.</NOTE></P>
<P>People and merchandi&s;e have been continually arriving from the We&s;t India i&s;lands, the &s;ource of the yellow fever for ages pa&s;t; yet the di&s;ea&s;e was never communicated to the people of this city, but in the heat of &s;ummer, and that only thrice in above &s;ixty years; probably the &s;eldomer, from the con|tagious matter having generally &s;pent it&s;elf, or eva|porated in the time of performing the voyages.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="026684_0006_0FD15A32F5356238">To &s;ati&s;fy the mind that the late epidemic, in Philadelphia, was introduced from a tropical climate, &s;ober rea&s;on requires but to know, that it is a di&s;ea&s;e natural to the We&s;t India i&s;lands; that it never was known to originate in this country; but has been admitted, without a doubt of any one till now, to have been always brought from thence; that it has been, this year, raging in tho&s;e i&s;lands more than u&s;ual; that there never was before &s;uch a plenty of means for bringing it from thence, and that it fir&s;t broke out in a part of the city near which &s;hips from tho&s;e i&s;lands, that had unu&s;ual numbers of &s;ick peo|ple on board, di&s;charged their cargoes. From all which circum&s;tances there ari&s;es an irre&s;i&s;tible pre|&s;umption, that the late contagious fever, called the yellow fever, was imported from the We&s;t India i&s;lands.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The introduction of the yellow fever from Boullam, in Africa, into St. George's, in Granada, was by the &s;hip Hankey, in February, in the year 1793, and it was called the "<HI>Boullam fever,</HI>" or "Boullam malig|nant pe&s;tilential fever." Doctor Chi&s;holm thinks it is the &s;ame with that which raged in Philadelphia in that year. He illu&s;trates this idea by the in&s;tance of a ve&s;&s;el, belonging to Philadelphia, introducing the di&s;ea&s;e into St. Pierre, Martinique, in October, 1793, and by a ve&s;&s;el from New London touching at St. Pierre, and carrying the infection to Granada in February, 1794. He adds, that on the &s;ick being put under his charge, he found the di&s;ea&s;e was his old enemy, the malignant pe&s;tilential fever, (meaning no doubt the &s;ame with that introduced from Boullam into Granada in the preceding February) which he &s;ucce&s;sfully treated with mercury. It raged in Granada in 1793, and generally among the We&s;t India i&s;lands, more or le&s;s, through that and the next following year.</P>
<P>The Boullam fever, in 1793, <HI>February,</HI> was imported into Granada from Boullam. In <HI>July</HI> following, into Phi|ladelphia from the We&s;t India i&s;lands. In <HI>October</HI> following, into Martinique from Philadelphia. Being identically the &s;ame in qualities, it was as readily returned from hence to the i&s;lands, as it was at fir&s;t brought from thence to the great towns of the continent. A ve&s;&s;el of Philadelphia lo&s;t her &s;upercargo at Granada, who died there of the Boullam fever &s;o early as April, 1793.</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="026684_0007_0FD15A349F378BF0">It has been incon&s;iderately imputed to Philadel|phia, that it is more liable to receive the yellow fever than other large towns of America. It is made by people who had collected from recent ha&s;ty pub|lications, that it had been three or four times in this city, without their being informed how often it had been in other towns. This fever, it &s;eems, has been at lea&s;t as often in Charle&s;ton, S. C. and New York. The accurate doctor <HI>Lining</HI> &s;peaks of four times that it was in Charle&s;ton; in the years 1732, &prime;39, &prime;45, and &prime;48. Charle&s;ton being nearer the ocean, the tropic, the Havanna, and the We&s;t India i&s;lands, &s;eems more liable to receive the infection than a town further from them, and near a hundred miles inland, that in general is remarkably healthful, and which would

probably &s;carcely ever receive it, were it not that it is more populous, and therefore has more of the air peculiar to large towns, which is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, toge|ther with the heat of a &s;ummer, to give action to the contagious matter, on its &s;peedy arrival <HI>fre&s;h</HI> from its tropical &s;ource.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o &s;aid that the yellow fever has been intro|duced into this country in &s;hips from Rotterdam and Ireland, crouded with pa&s;&s;engers: but this a great mi&s;take. The <HI>ho&s;pital fever</HI> has often been intro|duced by them into America, but never once the yellow fever, which is not a di&s;ea&s;e of northern climates. The <HI>ho&s;pital</HI> or <HI>gaol fever</HI> is thought to ari&s;e from <HI>animal effluvia.</HI> Pri&s;ons, ho&s;pitals and &s;hips are crouded with men, and abound with excre|mentitious <HI>animal effluvia pent up</HI> from fre&s;h air. The gaol fever is peculiar to &s;uch places, and is very infectious.</P>
<P>It is wi&s;hed tho&s;e per&s;ons who are apprehen&s;ive that contagious matter of the yellow fever is wrapped up in furniture, and they know not what, and that it will break out next &s;ummer, would be at the pains to inform them&s;elves from the hi&s;tories of the di&s;ea&s;e heretofore publi&s;hed, of the manner and the time when it u&s;ually arrived or broke out, and when it died away on this continent.

<CLOSER><SIGNED>B.</SIGNED>
<POSTSCRIPT>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>brain</HI> in all its parts, has been found in a natural condition.</P>
<P>Remark. <HI>The di&s;ea&s;e is local to the &s;tomach and parts near it. The brain is di&s;tant from the &s;eat of it. The fir&s;t, &s;e|cond, third and ninth of the following in&s;tances of di&s;&s;ection were of &s;uch per&s;ons as died early in the di&s;ea&s;e. Note well the</HI> ninth <HI>ob&s;ervation of the doctors.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The vi&s;cera of the <HI>thorax</HI> are perfectly &s;ound. The <HI>blood</HI> however, in the heart and veins, is fluid; &s;imilar in its con&s;i&s;tence to the blood of per&s;ons who have been hanged or de&s;troyed by electricity.</P>
<P>Remark. <HI>The</HI> early <HI>death from &s;pa&s;m of the &s;tomach&mdash; a &s;troke local that effects not general di&s;ea&s;e, may account for this: and moreover, in hot weather coagulation occurs not very &s;oon.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>&s;tomach</HI> and beginning of the <HI>duodenum</HI> are the parts that appear the mo&s;t di&s;ea&s;ed. In two per&s;ons who died of the di&s;ea&s;e on the <HI>fifth day,</HI> the villous membrane of the &s;tomach, e&s;pecially about its &s;maller end, was found highly <HI>inflamed,</HI> and this inflammation extended through the pylorus into the duodenum, &s;ome way. The inflammation here was exactly &s;imilar to that induced in the &s;tomach by acrid poi|&s;ons; as by ar&s;enic, which we have once had an opportunity of &s;eeing in a per&s;on de&s;troyed by it.</P>
<P>Remark. <HI>This illu&s;trates the reality of the matter of a &s;pecific contagion acting immediately on the &s;tomach. A part whereof may tend downward, and here and there attach to the inte&s;tines. If &s;ome of it is, in certain ca&s;es, enveloped in the pa&s;&s;ing excrement, &s;o as to be carried off at the common outlet,
<PB N="10" REF="026684_0010_0FD15A3974F23300">
yet enough of it may adhere, and act on the bowels to the wor&s;t purpo&s;es.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. The <HI>bile</HI> in the gall bladder was quite of its natural colour, though very vi&s;cid.</P>
<P>Remark. <HI>The fluids are not the immediate &s;ubjects of this di&s;ea&s;e.&mdash;&rindx; The preceding are in in&s;tances of</HI> early <HI>deaths, in the &s;tate of a contraction or inflammation of the &s;tomach. The following are of later deaths, where gangrene has oc|curred, after the inflammatory &s;tate.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. In a per&s;on who died on the <HI>eighth day</HI> of the di&s;ea&s;e, &s;everal &s;pots of <HI>extrava&s;ations</HI> were di&s;covered between the membranes, particularly about the &s;maller end of the &s;to|mach, the inflammation of which had <HI>con&s;iderably abated. Pus</HI> was &s;een in the beginning of the duodenum, and the villous membrane of this part was <HI>thickened.</HI></P>
<P>Remark. <HI>The inflammation abates as gangrene approaches. Was not the production of pus owing to an effort of health? The thickening was an indication of putrefaction.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. In two other per&s;ons who died at a more <HI>advanced period</HI> of the di&s;ea&s;e, the &s;tomach appeared <HI>&s;potted</HI> in many places with <HI>extrava&s;ations,</HI> and the <HI>inflammation di&s;appeared.</HI> It contained, as did al&s;o the inte&s;tines, a black liquor, &s;uch as had been vomited and purged before death.&mdash;This black liquor appears clearly to be an altered &s;ecretion from the liver: for, a fluid in all re&s;pects of the &s;ame qualities was found in the gall bladder. This liquor was &s;o acrid that it induced con&s;iderable inflammation and &s;welling on the ope|rator's hands, which remained &s;ome days. The villous membrane of the <HI>inte&s;tines,</HI> in the&s;e la&s;t two bodies, was found <HI>inflamed</HI> in <HI>&s;everal</HI> places.</P>
<P>Remark. <HI>The effects of the poi&s;on, though mo&s;tly local to the &s;tomach and duodenum, &s;ometimes appear in other parts of the bowels; and they act de&s;tructively where there is the rea|die&s;t &s;u&s;ceptibility. The poi&s;on fir&s;t is in contact with the &s;tomach: and after having effected a corro&s;ion and inflammation there, which is followed by a gangrene of that bowel, it or &s;ome part of it may de&s;cend, as it &s;eems, and rai&s;e an inflam|mation on the inferior bowels, where it chances to adhere, even
<PB N="11" REF="026684_0011_0FD15A3A9465D128">
after the &s;tomach is de&s;troyed. The general ma&s;s is not imme|diately contaminated by the attack on the &s;tomach, &s;o as to be|come gangrenous or putrid: otherwi&s;e, could a &s;ub&s;equent in|flammation be produced <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the other bowels?</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. The <HI>liver</HI> was of its natural appearance, excepting in one of the la&s;t per&s;ons, on the &s;urface of which a very few di&s;tended veins were &s;een, although other abdominal vi&s;cera were of healthy appearance.</P>
<P>Remark. <HI>The &s;pa&s;ms and corro&s;ions of the &s;tomach are con|&s;iderable. Such as mu&s;t &s;oon induce general di&s;order of the body, and exten&s;ive <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> effects both in the &s;olids and the fluids, though not always alike or in the &s;ame parts.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. The <HI>external &s;urface</HI> of the &s;tomach, as well as of the inte&s;tines, was quite free from the inflammation; the veins being di&s;tended with blood, which appeared through the tran&s;parent peritoneum, gave them a dark colour.</P>
<P>Remark. <HI>This is further in favour of the locality of this di&s;ea&s;e. How confined!&mdash;All is effected fir&s;t by contact with the fibres and nerves of the &s;tomach. The &s;ymptoms were dif|fu&s;e; and in the end the fluids with the &s;olids become exten|&s;ively morbid.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. The <HI>&s;tomach</HI> of tho&s;e who died <HI>early</HI> in the di&s;ea&s;e, was always <HI>contracted:</HI> but in tho&s;e who died in a more advanced period of it, where extrava&s;ations appeared, it was <HI>di&s;tended</HI> with air.</P>
<P>Remark. <HI>The corro&s;ive poi&s;on early injures the fibres of the &s;tomach, and occa&s;ions &s;pa&s;m; fir&s;t of the minuter parts with which it comes into contact; and this pre&s;ently extends &s;o con|&s;iderably and &s;o forcibly as to contract the whole or a great part of that bowel, during the inflammatory &s;tate, and until gangrene di&s;&s;olves the contraction of the fibres. The con&s;equent putrefaction is then attended with a di&s;ten&s;ion of the parts. Such &s;udden, &s;trong, and exten&s;ive contraction mu&s;t arre&s;t the natural and nece&s;&s;ary functions; and death comes with &s;peed, before time is given for gangrene to effect it.</HI></P>
