Seeing then that the&s;e things cannot be &s;poken again&s;t, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing ra&s;hly. For ye have brought hither the&s;e men, which are neither robbers of churches, nor yet bla&s;phemers of your godde&s;s. Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craft&s;men which are with him, have a matter again&s;t any man, the law is open, and there are deputies; let them implead one another. But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it &s;hall be determined in a lawful a&s;&s;embly. For we are in danger to be called in que&s;tion for this day's uprore, there being no cau&s;e whereby we may give an account of this concour&s;e.</P></Q>

<HEAD>A Brief ACCOUNT Of the <HI>Occa&s;ion, Proce&s;s</HI> and <HI>I&s;&s;ue</HI> of a late TRIAL, &amp;c. LONDON, March 12, 1743,4.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> Evening I came hither from the <HI>Glouce&s;ter</HI> A&s;&s;izes, where I have been engaged in a Trial between &s;ome of tho&s;e who are call'd <HI>Methodi&s;ts</HI> and &s;ome violent Rioters. Perhaps this News may a little &s;tartle you, and put you upon Enquiry (as it hath done &s;ome others) <Q>How we came to go to Law with our Adver&s;aries, when it is our <HI>avow'd Principle</HI> to &s;uffer patient|ly for the Truth's Sake?</Q> I will tell you, my dear Friend:&mdash;Tho' perhaps there is nothing in the World more abu&s;ed than the Law, and there are very few that go to Law out of a proper Principle; yet we hold, that there is a proper U&s;e of it, and the Law is good, when u&s;ed lawfully. &mdash; Whe|ther or no we have u&s;ed it lawfully in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, I &s;hall leave my Friend to judge, after I have told him the Motives that induced us to
<PB N="3" REF="005518_0003_10184BFF12EE8308">
engage in it. &mdash; The, <HI>Methodi&s;ts,</HI> you know, are every-where accounted Enthu&s;ia&s;ts, in the wor&s;t Sen&s;e of the Word; but tho' they are ac|counted &s;uch, yet they would not be Enthu&s;ia&s;ts in Reality. &mdash; Now we look upon it to be one Spe|cies of Enthu&s;ia&s;m, to expect to attain an End with|out making u&s;e of <HI>proper Means.</HI>&mdash;We al&s;o think, that Believers &s;hould be very careful not to be fond of &s;uffering Per&s;ecution, when they may avoid it, by making Application to the High Powers.&mdash;We are likewi&s;e of Opinion, that good Chri&s;tians will be good Subjects, and con&s;equently it is their Duty, as much as in them lies, to put a Stop to every thing, in a rightful Way, that may prove de&s;truc|tive to the King or the Government under which they live.&mdash;Chri&s;tian Mini&s;ters in particular, we think, ought to con&s;ider the Weakne&s;s of People's Grace, and, in Pity to precious Souls, do what they can to remove every thing out of the Way, that may di&s;courage or prevent poor People's hearing the everla&s;ting Go&s;pel.&mdash;The&s;e Con&s;ide|rations, my dear Friend, for &s;ome time pa&s;t, have led me to examine whether the <HI>Methodi&s;ts</HI> in general (and I my&s;elf in particular) have acted the Part of good Subjects and judicious Chri&s;tian Mini&s;ters, in &s;o long neglecting to make an Application to the &s;uperior Courts, and putting in Execution the whol|&s;ome Laws of the Land, in order to prevent tho&s;e many dreadful Outrages which have been commit|ted again&s;t us.&mdash;I need not de&s;cend to particulars.&mdash; Our Weekly Hi&s;tory is full of them; and before
<PB N="5" REF="005518_0004_10184C01F3E5F320">
that came out, &s;everal of our Brethren, both in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Wales,</HI> have received much Damage from time to time, and been frequently in great Hazard of their Lives.&mdash;<HI>Wilt&s;hire</HI> has been very remarkable for mobbing and abu&s;ing the <HI>Methodi&s;ts;</HI> and, for about ten Months la&s;t pa&s;t, it has al&s;o pre|vail'd very much in <HI>Glouce&s;ter&s;hire,</HI> e&s;pecially at <HI>Hampton,</HI> where our Friend Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> has a Dwel|ling Hou&s;e, and has been much ble&s;s'd to many People. This di&s;pleas'd the Grand Enemy of Souls, who &s;tirr'd up many of the ba&s;er Sort, privately encouraged by &s;ome of a higher Rank, to come from time to time, in great Numbers, with a Low|bell and Horn, to be&s;et the Hou&s;e, and beat and abu&s;e the People.&mdash;About the beginning of <HI>July</HI> la&s;t their Oppo&s;ition &s;eem'd to ri&s;e to the highe&s;t.&mdash; For &s;everal Days they a&s;&s;embled in great Bodies, broke the Windows, and mobb'd the People to &s;uch a Degree, that many expected to be murder'd, and hid them&s;elves in Holes and Corners, to avoid the Rage of their Adver&s;aries. Once, when I was there, they continued from Four in the Afternoon till Midnight rioting, giving loud Huzzas, ca&s;ting Dirt upon the Hearers, and making Proclamations, <Q>That no Anabapti&s;ts, Presbyterians <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;hould preach there, upon Pain of being fir&s;t put into a Skin-pit, and afterwards into a Brook.</Q>&mdash;At another time they pull'd one or two Women down the Stairs by the Hair of their Heads. And on the 10th of <HI>July</HI> they came to the Number of near a Hundred, in their u&s;ual Way, with a Low-bell and
<PB N="6" REF="005518_0005_10184C0703CCE680">
Horn, about Five in the Afternoon, forced into Mr. <HI>Adam</HI>'s Hou&s;e, and demanded him down the Stairs whereon he was preaching, took him out of his Hou&s;e, and threw him into a Skin-pit full of noi|&s;ome Things and &s;tagnated Water.&mdash;One of our Friends, named <HI>Williams,</HI> asking them, if they were not a&s;ham'd to &s;erve an innocent Man &s;o? They put him into the &s;ame Pit twice, and afterwards beat him, and dragged him along the Ken|nel. Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> quietly return'd home, and betook him&s;elf to Prayer, and exhorted the People to re|joice in &s;uffering for the Sake of the Go&s;pel. In about half an Hour they came to the Hou&s;e again, dragged him down the Stairs, and led him away a Mile and a Half to a Place called <HI>Bourn-brook,</HI> and then threw him in. A Stander-by, fearing he might be drowned, jump'd in and pulled him out; whereupon another of the Rioters immediately pu&s;h'd him into the Pool a &s;econd Time, and cut his Leg again&s;t a Stone, &s;o that he went lame for near a fortnight.&mdash;Both the Con&s;table and Ju&s;tices were applied to, but refu&s;ed to act; and &s;eem'd rather to countenance the Mobbing, hoping thereby <HI>Metho|di&s;m</HI> (as they called it) would be put a Stop to, at lea&s;t at <HI>Hampton.</HI> For a Sea&s;on they gained their End. &mdash; There was no Preaching for &s;ome Time, the People fearing to a&s;&s;emble on Account of the Violence of the Mob.&mdash;Upon my Return to Town I advi&s;ed with my Friends what to do.&mdash;We knew we wanted to exerci&s;e no Revenge again&s;t the Rio|ters, and yet we thought it wrong that the Go&s;pel
<PB N="7" REF="005518_0006_10184C09CB562150">
&s;hould be &s;topped by &s;uch Per&s;ons, when the Go|vernment under which we lived countenanced no &s;uch thing; and al&s;o, that it was ab&s;urd to thank God for whole&s;ome Laws, if they were not to be made u&s;e of. We knew very well that an Apo&s;tle had told us, that Magi&s;trates were ordain|ed for the Puni&s;hment of Evil-doers; and that they bear not the Sword in vain. &mdash; We were al&s;o fearful if any of our Brethren &s;hould be mur|dered by future Riotings (as in all Probability they might) that we &s;hould be acce&s;&s;ary to their Death if we neglected to tie up the Rioters Hands, which was all we de&s;ired to do.&mdash;Be&s;ides, we could not look upon this as allowed Per&s;ecution, &s;ince it was not countenanced by the Laws of the Land, and we might have Redre&s;s from the&s;e Rioters and infe|rior Magi&s;trates by appealing to <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> who&s;e real Friends and loyal Subjects we judged our&s;elves not to be, if we &s;uffer'd his Laws to be publickly tramp|led under Foot by &s;uch notorious Rioting; and which, tho' begun again&s;t the <HI>Methodi&s;ts,</HI> might ter|minate in open Rebellion again&s;t King <HI>George.</HI>&mdash;For the&s;e and &s;uch like Rea&s;ons, we thought it our Du|ty to move for an Information in the <HI>King's bench</HI> again&s;t five of the Ringleaders, and fixed upon the Riot which they made on <HI>Sunday July</HI> 10. when they put Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> and <HI>Williams</HI> into the Skin-pit and Brook. But before this was done, I wrote a Letter to one whom they called Captain, de&s;iring him to inform his A&s;&s;ociates, <Q>That if they would acknowledge their Fault, pay for curing a Boy's

Arm, which was broke the Night I was there, and mend the Windows of Mr. <HI>Adams</HI>'s Hou&s;e, we would readily pa&s;s all by; but if they per|&s;i&s;ted in their Re&s;olutions to riot, we thought it our Duty to prevent their doing, and others re|ceiving further Damage, by moving for an In|formation again&s;t them in the <HI>King's-Bench.</HI></Q> I al&s;o &s;ent a Copy of this Letter to a Mini&s;ter of the Town, and to a Ju&s;tice of the Peace, with a Letter to each from my&s;elf:&mdash;But all in vain.&mdash;The Rioters &s;ent me a mo&s;t in&s;olent An&s;wer, wrote me Word, <Q>they were in <HI>high-Spirits,</HI> and were re&s;olved there &s;hould be no more Preaching in <HI>Hampton.</HI></Q>&mdash; Finding them <HI>irreclaimable,</HI> we moved the next Term for a Rule of Court in the <HI>King's-Bench</HI> to lodge an Information again&s;t five of the Ring-leaders, for the Outrage committed, Violence of|fer'd, and Damage done to Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> and <HI>Wil|liams,</HI> on <HI>Sunday July</HI> 10.&mdash;The Rioters were ap|prized of it, appear'd by their Council, and prayed the Rule might be enlarged till the next Term.&mdash;It was granted. In the mean while they continued Mobbing, broke into Mr. <HI>Adams</HI>'s Hou&s;e one <HI>Sa|turday</HI> Night at Eleven o'Clock, when there was no Preaching, made tho&s;e that were in Bed get up, and &s;earched the Oven, Cellar, and every Corner of the Hou&s;e, to &s;ee whether they could find any <HI>Metho|di&s;ts.</HI> Some Time after, they threw another young Man into a Mud-pit three Times &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, and abu&s;ed the People in a dreadful Manner. The next Term came on.&mdash;We proved our Accu&s;ations
<PB N="9" REF="005518_0008_10184C0E59187FE0">
by twenty-&s;ix Affidavits; and the Defendants mak|ing no Reply, the Rule was made ab&s;olute, and an Information filed again&s;t them. &mdash; To this they pleaded <HI>NOT GUILTY</HI>; and according to the Method in the Crown-Office, the Cau&s;e was referred to the A&s;&s;ize held at <HI>Glouce&s;ter, March</HI> 3d. &mdash; Thither I went, and on <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> Morning la&s;t the Trial came on. It was given out by &s;ome, <Q>That the <HI>Methodi&s;ts</HI> were to lo&s;e the Cau&s;e, whether right or wrong.</Q> And I believe the Defendants depended much on a Suppo&s;ition that the Gentle|men and Jury would be prejudiced again&s;t us. We were ea&s;y, knowing that our Saviour had the Hearts of all in his Hands. Being aware of the great Con&s;equences of gaining or lo&s;ing this Trial, both in re&s;pect to us and the Nation, we kept a Day of Fa&s;ting and Prayer thro' all the Societies both in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Wales.</HI> Our <HI>Scotch</HI> Friends al&s;o joined with us, and chearfully committed our Cau&s;e into his Hands by whom Kings reign and Princes decree Ju&s;tice. We had about thirty Witne&s;&s;es to prove the Riot and Facts laid down in the Informa|tion.&mdash; Our Council opened the Cau&s;e (as I heard, being not pre&s;ent when the Trial begun) with much Solidity and &s;ound Rea&s;oning: They &s;hewed, <Q>That Rioters were not to be Reformers; and that his Maje&s;ty had no where put the Reins of Government into the Hands of Mobbers, or made them Judge or Jury.</Q>&mdash;One of them, in particu|lar, with great Gravity reminded the Gentlemen on the Jury of the Advice of <HI>Gamaliel,</HI> a Doc|tor

of the Law, recorded <HI>Acts</HI> v. 38, 39. <Q>Re|frain from the&s;e Men, and let them alone; for if this Council, or this Work be of Men, it will come to nought: But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it, le&s;t haply ye be found even to fight again&s;t God.</Q> Our Witne&s;&s;es were then called.&mdash;I came into Court when the &s;econd Wit|ne&s;s was examining.&mdash;Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> and four more (three of which <HI>were not called Methodi&s;ts</HI>) &s;o clearly proved both the Riot and the Facts laid to the Charge of the Defendants, that the Judge was of Opinion there needed no other Evidence.&mdash;The Council for the Defendants then ro&s;e, and exerted a good deal of Oratory, and I think &s;aid all that could well be &s;aid, to make the be&s;t of a bad Matter. One urged, <Q>That we were Enthu&s;ia&s;ts, and our Principles and Practices had &s;uch a Tendency to infect and hurt the People, that it was right, in his Opinion, for any private Per&s;on to &s;tand up and put a Stop to us; and whoever did &s;o was a Friend to his Country.</Q>&mdash;He &s;trove to influence the Jury by telling them, <Q>That if a Verdict was given again&s;t the Defendants, it wou'd co&s;t them Two Hundred Pounds:&mdash;That the Defendants Rioting was not premeditated; but that coming to hear Mr. <HI>Adams,</HI> and being offended at his Doctrine, a &s;udden Quarrel aro&s;e, and thereby the unhappy Men were led into the pre&s;ent Fray, which he could have wi&s;h'd had not happen'd; but however, it did not amount to a <HI>Riot,</HI> but only <HI>an A&s;&s;ault.</HI></Q> Their other Council inform'd
<PB N="11" REF="005518_0010_10184C1533D58030">
the Jury, <Q>That they would undertake to prove that the <HI>Methodi&s;ts</HI> began the Tumult fir&s;t.</Q>&mdash; He was plea&s;ed al&s;o to mention me by Name, &amp; ac|quainted the Court, <Q>That Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> had been travelling from Common to Common, making the People cry, and then picking their Pockets, under Pretence of collecting Money for the Co|lony of <HI>Georgia;</HI> and knowing that <HI>Glouce&s;ter|&s;hire</HI> was a populous Country, he at la&s;t came there. &mdash;That he had now &s;everal Curates, of which Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> was one, who in his Preaching had found Fault with the Proceedings of the Clergy, and &s;aid if the People went to hear them, they would be damned.&mdash;He added, that there had lately been &s;uch Mobbing in <HI>Stafford&s;hire,</HI> that a Regiment of Soldiers was &s;ent down to &s;uppre&s;s them; in&s;inuating that the <HI>Methodi&s;ts</HI> were the Authors&mdash;That we had now another Cau&s;e of a like Nature depending in <HI>Wilt&s;hire,</HI> and that we were not of that mild, pacifick Spi|rit, as we wou'd pretend to be.</Q> &mdash; This, and much more to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e, though foreign to the Matter in hand, plea&s;ed many of the Audi|tors, who expre&s;&s;ed their Satisfaction in hearing the <HI>Methodi&s;ts</HI> in general, and me in particular, thus la&s;hed, by frequent laughing.&mdash;The Eyes of all were upon me &mdash;Our Saviour kept me quite ea&s;y. &mdash;I thought of that ver&s;e of <HI>Horace,</HI>

<HI>Tertullus</HI>'s accu&s;ing <HI>Paul</HI> came al&s;o to my Mind, and I look'd upon my&s;elf as highly honoured in having &s;uch Things &s;poken again&s;t me fal&s;ly for <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s great Name's Sake.&mdash;To prove what the De|fendant's Council had in&s;inuated, they called up a young Man, who was own Brother to one of the Defendants, and one of the Mob.&mdash;He &s;wore point blank, <Q>That Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> &s;aid, if People went to Church they wou'd be damned; and if they would come to him, he wou'd carry them to <HI>Je|&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI>&mdash;He &s;wore al&s;o that the Pool in which Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> was thrown, was no deeper than half way up his Legs. He &s;aid fir&s;t that there were but about ten of them that came to the Hou&s;e of Mr. <HI>Adams</HI>; and then he &s;wore that there were about three&s;core.&mdash;He &s;aid there was a Low-Bell, and that one of the Defendants did ask Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> to come down off the Stairs, but that none of them went up to him, upon which Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> willingly obey'd, went with them briskly along the Street, and, as he wou'd have repre&s;ented it, put him&s;elf into the Skin-pit and Pool, and &s;o came out again.</Q> He &s;aid al&s;o &s;ome other things, but thro' his whole Evidence appeared &s;o flagrantly fal&s;e, that one of the Council &s;aid, <Q>It was enough to make his Hair &s;tand an end.</Q> The Judge him&s;elf wi&s;h'd, <Q>He he had &s;o much Reli|gion as to fear an Oath.</Q>&mdash;So he went down in Di&s;grace. Their Second Evidence was an aged Woman, Mother to one of the Defendants.&mdash;She &s;wore, <Q>That her Son did go up the Stairs by
<PB N="13" REF="005518_0012_10184C1AA08F6360">
Mr. <HI>Adams,</HI> and that Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> tore her Son's Coat, and would have broke his Neck down Stairs.</Q> But &s;he talk'd &s;o <HI>fa&s;t,</HI> and her Evidence was &s;o palpably <HI>fal&s;e,</HI> that &s;he was &s;ent away in as much Di&s;grace as the other. Their third and la&s;t Evidence was Father to one who was in the Mob, tho' not one of the Defendants. The chief he had to &s;ay was, <Q>That when Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> was coming from the Pool, one met him, and &s;aid, Brother, how do you do? Upon which he an&s;wered, that he had received no Damage, but had been in the Pool and came out again.</Q> So that all their Evidences, however contra|ry one to another, yet corroborated ours, and prov|ed the Riot out of their own Mouths. The Book was then given to a Ju&s;tice of the Peace, who had for|merly taken up Mr. <HI>Cennick,</HI> for preaching near <HI>Stroud,</HI> and had lately given many &s;ignal Proofs thas he was no Friend to the <HI>Methodi&s;ts.</HI>&mdash;But he intending to &s;peak only about their Characters, and the Council and Judge looking upon that as quite impertinent to the Matter in hand, he was not ad|mitted as an Evidence. &mdash; Upon this, his Lord|&s;hip, with great Candor and Impartiality, &s;um'd up the Evidence, and told the Jury, <Q>That he thought they &s;hould bring <HI>all</HI> the Defendants <HI>in Guilty</HI>; for our Evidences had &s;ufficiently proved the Whole of the Information, and al&s;o, that the Riot was premeditated. &mdash; He &s;aid, That, in his Opinion, the chief of the Defen|dant's Evidence was <HI>incredible;</HI> and that, &s;up|po&s;ing the <HI>Methodi&s;ts</HI> were <HI>Heterodox,</HI> (as perhaps
<PB N="14" REF="005518_0013_10184C1C265074D8">
they might be) it belong'd to the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Government to call them to an Account; that they were Subjects, and Rioters were not to be their Reformers."</Q>&mdash;He al&s;o reminded them of <Q>the dreadful ill Con&s;equences of Rioting at <HI>any Time,</HI> much more at &s;uch a critical Time as this; that Rioting was the Fore-runner of, and might end in Rebellion; that it was Felony, without Benefit of Clergy, to pull down a <HI>Meet|ing-hou&s;e</HI>; and, for all as he knew, it was <HI>High Trea&s;on</HI> to pull down even a Bawdy hou&s;e.&mdash;That this Information came from the <HI>King's Bench,</HI> that his Maje&s;ty's Ju&s;tices there thought they had had &s;ufficient Rea&s;on to grant it; that the Matters contain'd in it had been evidently prov'd before them, and con&s;equently they &s;hould bring all the Defendants in <HI>Guilty.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Upon this the Jury were de&s;ir'd to con&s;ider of their Verdict. There &s;eem'd to be &s;ome little De|mur among&s;t them. His Lord&s;hip perceiving it, inform'd them, <Q>They had nothing to do with the <HI>Damages,</HI> (that was to be referr'd to the <HI>King's Bench</HI>) they were only to con&s;ider whether the Defendants were <HI>guilty or not.</HI></Q> Whereupon, in a few Minutes, they gave a Verdict for the Pro&s;e|cutors, and brought in <HI>all</HI> the Defendants <HI>guilty of the whole Information lodg'd again&s;t them.</HI> &mdash; I then retired to my Lodgings, kneel'd down, and gave Thanks, with &s;ome Friends, to our all-conquer|ing <HI>Emanuel.</HI>&mdash;Afterwards I went to the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> pray|ed, and returned Thanks with the Witne&s;&s;es, ex+horted
