<BIBL>1 PETER II. 13, 14, 15, 16.</BIBL>
<Q><P>SUBMIT your&s;elves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's &s;ake: Whether it be to the King as &s;upreme; or unto Governors, as unto them who are &s;ent by him, for the puni&s;hment of evil-doers, and for the prai&s;e of them that do well.</P>
<P>For &s;o is the will of God, that with well-doing ye may put to &s;ilence the ignorance of fooli&s;h men: As free, and not u&s;ing your liberty for a cloak of maliciou&s;ne&s;s, but as the &s;ervants of God.</P></Q>

<P>_THE great and wi&s;e Author of our being, has &s;o formed us, that the love of liberty is natural. This pa&s;&s;ion, like all other original prin|ciples of the human mind, is, in it&s;elf,
<PB N="6" REF="012256_0005_0F8A6C1D751829C0">
perfectly innocent, and de&s;igned for excellent purpo&s;es, though, like them, liable, through abu&s;e, of becoming the cau&s;e of mi&s;chief to our&s;elves and others. In a civil &s;tate, the genius of who&s;e con&s;titu|tion is agreeable to it, this pa&s;&s;ion, while in its full vigor, and under proper regu|lation, is not only the cement of the political body, but the wakeful guardian of its intere&s;ts, and the great animating &s;pring of u&s;eful and &s;alutary operations; and then only is it injurious to the public, or to individuals, when, thro' mi&s;appre|hen&s;ion of things, or by being overbal|lanced by &s;elf-love, it takes a wrong direction.</P>
<P>CIVIL and eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;ocieties are, in &s;ome e&s;&s;ential points, different. Our rights, as men, and our rights, as chri&s;|tians, are not, in all re&s;pects, the &s;ame. It cannot, however, be rea&s;onably &s;up|po&s;ed, but that this u&s;eful and important principle, mu&s;t, in its genuine influence and operation, be friendly to both: For although our Saviour has a&s;&s;ured us, his kingdom is not of this world; and it be
<PB N="7" REF="012256_0006_0F8A6C1E20B07820">
manife&s;t from the Go&s;pel, which con|tains its con&s;titution and laws, that his &s;ubjects &s;tand in &s;ome &s;pecial relation, and are under &s;ome peculiar &s;ubjection to him, di&s;tinct from their relation to, and connection with civil &s;ocieties, yet we ju&s;tly conclude, that as this divine polity, with its &s;acred maxims, proceeded from the wi&s;e and benevolent Author of our being, none of its injunctions can be incon&s;i&s;tent with that love of liberty, he him&s;elf has implanted in us, nor interfere with the laws and government of human &s;ocieties, who&s;e con&s;titution is con&s;i&s;tent with the rights of men.</P>
<P>CHRIST came to &s;et up a kingdom diver&s;e, indeed, from the kingdoms of this world, but it was no part of his de|&s;ign to put down, or de&s;troy government and rule among men. He came to pro|cure liberty for his people, and to make them free, in the mo&s;t important &s;en&s;e, yet not to exempt them from &s;ubjection to civil powers, or to di&s;&s;olve their obliga|tions to one another, as members of political bodies.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="012256_0007_0F8A6C202158F4F0">
As to things of this nature, all eccle|&s;ia&s;tical con&s;titutions and laws, as coming from GOD, mu&s;t leave men ju&s;t as they were; becau&s;e all civil &s;ocieties, founded on principles of rea&s;on and equity, are, as well as the peculiar laws of Chi&s;tianity, agreeable to the Deity, and certainly, intimations from the all-perfect mind, cannot be contradictory.</P>
<P>THESE things, &s;eem not to have been rightly apprehended, and well under|&s;tood by men, at all times and in all places. The Jews, &s;ome of whom were early pro&s;elyted to the chri&s;tian faith, had imbibed high notions of their liberty, and &s;uperiority to all others, as the peculiar people of GOD; and were loth to own &s;ubjection to the Romans, as a civil &s;tate, when they were actually under their dominion. And &s;ome con|verts from among the Gentiles, tho' they had not the&s;e national prejudices. yet from their &s;ubjection to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as their King and Ruler, and, as 'tis probable, from mi&s;taking the meaning of &s;ome apo&s;tolic declarations, a&s;&s;erting
<PB N="9" REF="012256_0008_0F8A6C204C5DD520">
their freedom, as chri&s;tians, di&s;claimed likewi&s;e all human authority over them.</P>
<P>MEN of this ca&s;t, gave no &s;mall trou|ble both to Church and State, in the early days of the Go&s;pel. Of &s;uch the Apo&s;tle Peter &s;peaks where he &s;ays&mdash;<HI>They de&s;pi&s;e government: Pre&s;umptuous are they. Self-willed, they are not afraid to &s;peak evil of dignities.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Pet. II. 10.</NOTE></P>
<P>SUCH men as the&s;e, and their &s;editious, turbulent behaviour, I doubt not, this &s;ame Apo&s;tle had in view, when he de|livered the in&s;tructions in my text, by which he endeavoured to guard chri&s;ti|ans again&s;t their evil practices.</P>
<P>BUT, as all authority, demanding &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and all &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, due to &s;uch authority, are likely to be be&s;t un|der&s;tood, by having the&s;e things reduced to their fir&s;t principles;&mdash;by having the foundation of &s;uch authority fairly pro|duced, and its ju&s;t boundaries, which mu&s;t be the mea&s;ure of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion due to it, clearly marked out: And as &s;uch &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion is mo&s;t likely to be duly yielded,
<PB N="10" REF="012256_0009_0F8A6C214BDED950">
by having the rea&s;ons and motives there|of plainly exhibited, &s;o the&s;e are things which &s;eem here aimed at by the Apo&s;tle. <HI>Submit your&s;elves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's &s;ake: whether it be to the King as &s;upreme; or unto Governors, as unto them who are &s;ent by him for the puni&s;hment of evil-doers, and for the prai&s;e of them that do well. For &s;o is the will of God, that with well-doing ye may put to &s;ilence the ig|norance of fooli&s;h men: As free, and not u&s;ing your liberty for a cloke of maliciou&s;ne&s;s, but as the &s;ervants of God.</HI></P>
<P>IN the&s;e words he gives us a compen|dium of civil government; repre&s;enting its origin and great de&s;ign; that &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion, or obedience which is due to it; and the true principles from which &s;uch obedience &s;hould flow.</P>
<P>UPON this general view of the &s;ubject, it is obvious, that if handled with any degree of propriety, it may offer u&s;eful in&s;tructions, both to Rulers, and tho&s;e under their government.&mdash;A mode&s;t at|tempt to do this, will not, it is hoped, be
<PB N="11" REF="012256_0010_0F8A6C21E3EC6558">
di&s;agreeable to this re&s;pectable audience, by whom I a&s;k to be heard with patience and candor.</P>
<P>THE FIRST thing offered to our con|&s;ideration is, the ORIGIN of civil go|vernment, from whence all authority in the &s;tate mu&s;t take its ri&s;e. And this is &s;aid to be from man. <HI>Submit your&s;elves to every ordinance of man,</HI> &amp;c. More in|telligibly, perhaps, it might be rendered, "to every human In&s;titution or appoint|ment." And this may be ju&s;tly under|&s;tood, as having re&s;pect to every kind of civil government, under whatever form it is admini&s;tred:&mdash;It is the ordinance,&mdash;the in&s;titution or appointment of man.</P>
<P>THIS does not imply, however, that civil government is not from God; for thus it is &s;ometimes repre&s;ented, and is expre&s;&s;ly &s;aid to be the <HI>ordinance of God.</HI> So St. Paul declares.&mdash;<HI>There is no power but of God. The powers that be, are or|dained of God. Who ever therefore re&s;i&s;teth the power, re&s;i&s;teth the ordinance of God.</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. XIII. 1, 7.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="012256_0011_0F8A6C22A90C06B0">
CIVIL government is not, indeed, &s;o from God, as to be expre&s;&s;ly appointed by him in his word. Much le&s;s is any particular form of it there delineated, as a &s;tanding model for the nations of the world: Nor are any particular per&s;ons, pointed out, as having, in a lineal de&s;cent, an indefea&s;ible right to rule over others.</P>
<P>BUT civil government may be &s;aid to be from God, as it is he who qualifies men for, and in his over-ruling provi|dence, rai&s;es them to places of authority and rule; for by him <HI>Kings reign:</HI>&mdash;As he has given us, in his word, the character of Rulers, and pointed out both <HI>their</HI> duty, and the duty of tho&s;e under their authority; which &s;uppo&s;es, not only the exi&s;tence of civil government, but that it is agreeable to his will: And e&s;pecially and chiefly, as civil government is founded in the very nature of man, as a &s;ocial be|ing, and in the nature and con&s;titu|tion of things. It is manife&s;tly for the good of &s;ociety:&mdash;It is the dictate of na|ture:&mdash;It is the voice of rea&s;on, which may be &s;aid to be the voice of God.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="012256_0012_0F8A6C2352203688">
IT being only thus that civil govern|ment is the ordinance of God, there is no impropriety in a&s;&s;erting likewi&s;e that it is the <HI>ordinance of man.</HI> For though it is founded in the nature of man, and in the con&s;titution of things, which are from God, yet nothing is plainer, than that it proceeds immediately from men. It is not a matter of nece&s;&s;ity, &s;trictly &s;peaking, but of choice. This is the ca&s;e, as to government in general:&mdash;This is mo&s;t evidently the ca&s;e, as to any particular form of government.</P>
<P>ALL men are naturally in a &s;tate of freedom, and have an equal claim to li|berty. No one, by nature, nor by any &s;pecial grant from the great Lord of all, has any authority over another. All right therefore in any to rule over others, mu&s;t originate from tho&s;e they rule over, and be granted by them. Hence, all government, con&s;i&s;tent with that natural freedom, to which all have an equal claim, is founded in compact, or agree|ment between the parties;&mdash;between Rulers and their Subjects, and can be no
<PB N="14" REF="012256_0013_0F8A6C243723F398">
otherwi&s;e. Becau&s;e Rulers, receiving their authority originally and &s;olely from the people, can be rightfully po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of no more, than the&s;e have con&s;ented to, and conveyed to them.</P>
<P>AND the fundamental laws, which are the ba&s;is of government, and form the political con&s;titution of the &s;tate;&mdash;which mark out, and fix the chief lines and boundaries between the authority of Rulers, and the liberties and privileges of the people, are, and can be no other, in a free &s;tate, than what are mutually agreed upon and con&s;ented to. What|ever authority therefore the &s;upreme power has, to make laws, to appoint officers, &amp;c. for the regulation and government of the &s;tate, being an autho|rity derived from the community, and granted by them, can be ju&s;tly exerci&s;ed, only within certain limits, and to a certain extent, according to agreement.</P>
<P>To &s;uppo&s;e otherwi&s;e, and that with|out a delegated power and con&s;titutional right, Rulers may make laws, and ap|point
<PB N="15" REF="012256_0014_0F8A6C24D2ADD858">
officers for their execution, and force them into effect, i. e. according to their own arbitrary will and plea&s;ure, is to defeat the great de&s;ign of civil govern|ment, and utterly to aboli&s;h it. It is to make Rulers ab&s;olutely de&s;potic, and to &s;ubject the people to a &s;tate of &s;lavery; becau&s;e it will then be in the power of Rulers, by virtue of new laws and regulations, they &s;hall plea&s;e to make, to &s;ubvert and annihilate the pre&s;ent con&s;titution, and to &s;trip the &s;ubject of every kind of privilege.</P>
<P>THIS may be briefly evidenced by a &s;ingle in&s;tance.</P>
<P>IT is e&s;&s;ential to a free &s;tate, for without this it cannot be free, that no man &s;hall have his property taken from him, but by his own con&s;ent, given by him&s;elf or by others deputed to act for him. Let it be &s;uppo&s;ed then, that Rulers a&s;&s;ume a power to act contrary to this fundamental principle, what mu&s;t be the con&s;equence? If by &s;uch u&s;urped authority, they can demand and take a
<PB N="16" REF="012256_0015_0F8A6C2599D5F3E0">
penny, by the &s;ame authority they may a pound, and even the whole &s;ub&s;tance of the &s;ubject, &s;o as to make him wholly dependent on their plea&s;ure, having nothing that he can call his own; and what is he then but a perfect &s;lave?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Men <HI>in &s;ociety having property,</HI> they have &s;uch a right to the goods, which by the law of the community are theirs, that nobody hath a right to take their &s;ub|&s;tance, or any part of it from them, without their own con&s;ent: Without this they have no property at all; for I have truly no <HI>property</HI> in that, which another can by right take from me when he plea&s;es again&s;t my con&s;ent. Hence it is a mi&s;take to think, that the &s;upreme or legi&s;lative power of any common|wealth, can do what it will, and di&s;po&s;e of the e&s;tates of the &s;ubject arbitrarily, or take any part of them at plea&s;ure. Lock on civil Government.</NOTE></P>
<P>THIS, at fir&s;t view, is manife&s;tly incon&s;i&s;tent with all ju&s;t conception of freedom; and is the very e&s;&s;ence of arbitrary and tyrannical power.</P>
<P>Now, all Rulers in a &s;tate, and all power and authority with which they are ve&s;ted;&mdash;the very being, and form of government, with all its con&s;titutional laws, being thus from the people, hence civil government, is called, and with great propriety, the <HI>ordinance of man,</HI>&mdash;an human in&s;titution.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="012256_0016_0F8A6C2651776B98">
THIS is the ca&s;e, as to the Briti&s;h government in particular, under which we have the happine&s;s to live. Its con|&s;titutional laws are comprized in <HI>Magna-Charta,</HI> or the great charter of the nation. This contains, in general, the liberties and privileges of the people, and is, <HI>virtually,</HI> a compact between the King and them; the reigning Prince, explicitly engaging, by &s;olemn oath, to govern according to the&s;e laws:&mdash;Beyond the extent of the&s;e then, or contrary to them, he can have no rightful authority at all.</P>
<P>IF the preceding po&s;itions, and the rea&s;onings from them are ju&s;t, the fol|lowing things may be noticed, as dedu|cible therefrom, or clo&s;ely connected therewith,&mdash;That it is highly requi&s;ite, for the good of the &s;tate, that both Rulers and people be well acquainted with, and keep in mind the con&s;titutional laws of government&mdash;Rulers, that they may be directed and guided thereby, and not depart from, or counteract the de&s;ign of their in&s;titution, to the injury, or di&s;|quietude
<PB N="18" REF="012256_0017_0F8A6C27D679DC48">
of the people.&mdash;And people, that knowing the bounds of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and the extent of their privileges, they may be guarded again&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and yield a ready and full obedience.</P>
<P>EQUALLY requi&s;ite it mu&s;t be likewi&s;e, for the &s;ame end, that there be no my&s;|teries in the governing plan:&mdash;That all laws and rules of government, be as plain as po&s;&s;ible, and ea&s;y to be under|&s;tood, to prevent contentious di&s;putes between Rulers and their &s;ubjects;&mdash;to preclude the former, from tyrannical op|pre&s;&s;ion, under colour of lawful autho|rity, and the latter from rebellious di&s;o|bedience, under pretence of privilege.</P>
<P>FOR, it follows from what has been &s;aid, that as all di&s;obedience in &s;ubjects, to con&s;titutional authority, is rebellion again&s;t government, and merits puni&s;h|ment adequate to the crime, &s;o all a&s;&s;umed power in Rulers, not granted them by the con&s;titution, is without ju&s;t authority, and &s;o far forth, can claim no &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="012256_0018_0F8A6C2888320D90">
"As u&s;urpation," &s;ays the great and judicious Mr. LOCKE, "is the exerci&s;e of power which another hath a right to, &s;o Tyranny is the exerci&s;e of power be|yond right, which no body can have a right to." And again. "Where-ever law ends, Tyranny begins, if the law be tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ed to another's harm. And who|&s;oever in authority exceeds the power given him by law, and makes u&s;e of the force, he has under his command, to compa&s;s that upon the &s;ubject, which the law allows not, cea&s;es in that to be a magi&s;trate: And acting without autho|rity, may be oppo&s;ed as any other man, who by force invades the right of another."</P>
<P>AND tho' it may not always be prudent and be&s;t, to re&s;i&s;t &s;uch power, and &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion may be yielded, yet that the people have a right to re&s;i&s;t, is undeni|able; otherwi&s;e the ab&s;urd and exploded doctrines of pa&s;&s;ive obedience, and non-re&s;i&s;tance, mu&s;t be admitted in their ut|mo&s;t extent, and their con&s;equences patiently borne. And it mu&s;t be granted finally, that the people as well as their

Rulers, are proper judges of the civil con&s;titution they are under, and of their own rights and privileges; el&s;e, how &s;hall they know when the&s;e are invaded;&mdash;when &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion is due to authorita|tive requi&s;itions, and when not?</P>
<P>BUT we are now to con&s;ider</P>
<P>SECONDLY, THE great de&s;ign of Civil Government, and the end for which Rulers are appointed; and that is the good of the community, or political body.&mdash;<HI>Whether it be to the King, as &s;upreme; or unto Governors, as unto them who are &s;ent by him, for the puni&s;hment of evil-doers, and for the prai&s;e of them that do well.</HI></P>
<P>RULERS are not appointed, indeed, for the happine&s;s of the people, exclu&s;ive of their own, as if the&s;e things were inconnected. But, as it would be un|rea&s;onable, that &s;ome &s;hould be advanced above their brethren,&mdash;be cloathed with authority, and honorably &s;upported, meerly for the &s;ake of their own ea&s;e,

dignity and grandeur, &s;o it would be equally unrea&s;onable, that Rulers &s;hould be &s;laves to the people, and watch and labour for their welfare, without &s;haring in it.</P>
<P>BUT the happine&s;s of Rulers and of their Subjects, are not thus exclu&s;ive of each other, but perfectly coincident. They are both parts of the &s;ame body,&mdash;their true intere&s;ts are interwoven, and their happine&s;s in&s;eparable.

<P>THEY are to con&s;ider them&s;elves as rai&s;ed above their brethren, and inve&s;ted with authority, for more noble and gene|rous purpo&s;es;&mdash;for the peace and well|fare of the Community, committed to their care: Hence it is &s;aid, of the civil Ruler, <HI>he is the mini&s;ter of God to thee for good.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom.

NOR can any other end be imagined, worthy of rea&s;onable beings, why men &s;hould put them&s;elves out of a &s;tate of natural freedom, and &s;ubject them&s;elves to the authority and rule of others, but for their greater good;&mdash;for the &s;ecuring, more effectually, their ju&s;t rights, liber|ties and privileges.</P>
<P>THIS is the great end of their forming into &s;ociety;&mdash;of their e&s;tabli&s;hing cer|tain laws, as the general mea&s;ures of right and wrong, and giving power to &s;ome, to govern the whole community by &s;uch laws.</P>
<P>THIS being the de&s;ign of civil go|vernment, good Rulers are ju&s;tly con&s;i|dered as benefactors to the people.

<P>And, finally. IT mu&s;t be of great importance, to the good order and well|fare of the &s;tate, that Rulers be men of di&s;tingui&s;hed piety and virtue, who will be likely to rule by example as well as law.

<P>MEN of this character will act with fidelity and zeal in the &s;ervice of the public, con&s;idering them&s;elves as ac|countable to God, as well as to men.

of con&s;tant ble&s;&s;ings. Nor can they fail of engaging the e&s;teem and love, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the people.</P>
<P>WE may now in the THIRD place, con&s;ider that &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion which is due to government; and take &s;ome particular notice of the nature and extent of it. <HI>Submit your&s;elves to every ordinance of man, whether it be to the King as &s;upreme, or un|to Governors,</HI> &amp;c. Similar to which is that of St. Paul, <HI>Let every &s;oul be &s;ubject to the higher powers.&mdash;Put them in mind to be &s;ubject to principalities and powers, to obey magi&s;trates,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>THE duties of Rulers and Subjects are reciprocal, and mutually imply each other. If &s;ome are to govern, others are to &s;ubmit to their government, and to be obedient to their authority; other|wi&s;e Rulers are but an empty name;&mdash;the con&s;titution is di&s;&s;olved, and anarchy en&s;ues.</P>
<P>NOR is this &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion due only to the Supreme Ruler, but to all in lawful au|thority

under him, down to the lowe&s;t officer in the &s;tate. Not only to the King, but to tho&s;e who are &s;ent by him, to carry on the various parts of the admi|ni&s;tration. Di&s;obedience to inferior of|ficers, while acting by lawful authority, is di&s;obedience to the highe&s;t power, as it is by authority derived from thence, that all in &s;ubordinate places of civil tru&s;t, execute their offices. Submi&s;&s;ion is like|wi&s;e due to all con&s;titutional laws, whe|ther, they &s;uit the pre&s;ent intere&s;t of in|dividuals, or not. A man is not to di&s;|obey a ju&s;t law, calculated for the pub|lic good, becau&s;e, in certain circum&s;tan|ces, it operates again&s;t his private intere&s;t.</P>
<P>UNLIMITED &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, however, is not due to government, in a free &s;tate. There are certain boundaries, beyond which, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion cannot be ju&s;tly requi|red, nor is therefore due. The&s;e limits are marked out, and fixt, by the known, e&s;tabli&s;hed, and fundamental laws of the &s;tate. The&s;e laws being con&s;ented to by the governing power, confine, as well as direct its operation and influence, and

<P>AND no wi&s;e and ju&s;t Ruler, we may &s;uppo&s;e, would aim at wantonly leaping over the&s;e bounds, and acting beyond them, as this would be, not only acting without lawful authority, and injuriou&s;ly robbing the people of their rights, but would tend to create unhappy jealou&s;ies, and to &s;tir up broils and contentions in the &s;tate, which might give him much unea&s;ine&s;s, if no wor&s;e con&s;equences &s;hould follow.</P>
<P>IT was a fine expre&s;&s;ion of a Spartan Ruler, and indicated the freedom and happine&s;s of the &s;tate, who, upon being a&s;ked, "who governed at <HI>Sparta?</HI> an|&s;wered the laws, and the magi&s;trates <HI>ac|cording</HI> to the&s;e laws." The con&s;tituti|onal laws of the &s;tate, are, properly, the &s;upreme power, being obligatory on the whole community,&mdash;on the highe&s;t officer, as well as the lowe&s;t &s;ub|ject.</P>

<P>FOR there have been Rulers, and may be &s;uch again, who look with wi&s;hful eyes on the liberties and privileges of the people. Who con&s;ider them as a prey, worthy to be &s;eized, for the gratification of their pride and ambition,&mdash;of their cruelty or covetou&s;ne&s;s Such, under one pretence or other, will be &s;tretching and enlarging their power, and gra&s;ping at more and more, 'till, if not ob&s;truc|ted, civil government will be converted into ab&s;olute tyranny, and a free people into &s;laves.</P>
