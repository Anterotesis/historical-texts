<HEAD>The PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the various Treati&s;es that have been publi&s;hed for the Improvement and A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Chri&s;tians of different Cla&s;&s;es, I have often lamented the want of &s;ome truly evangelical Manuel to put into the Hands of the Lambs of the Flock; who, as they are the Purcha&s;e of EMANUEL's Blood, and as their tender Minds &s;tand in the greate&s;t need of Cultivation, are certainly entituled to all the Helps we can furni&s;h them with &mdash; As one (and I e&s;teem it an e&s;&s;ential) Part of my Duty, requires me to &s;pend &s;ome Time, every Week, with Children of different Ages and Capacities; I have had great Opportunities of ob&s;erving in what Manner, and by what Methods, divine Truths may be conveyed to their Minds &s;o as to give them &s;ome Concern about their eternal State: The Reader will plea&s;e to ob&s;erve that I &s;peak here of human Methods only, which it is our Duty to u&s;e looking to the Fountain of Life for a Ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>I am convinced from my own Ob&s;ervation, that tho&s;e Methods under GOD, are the mo&s;t likely to an&s;wer the &s;alutary Purpo&s;es above mentioned, which aim not only at informing and &s;ettling the Judgment of young Per&s;ons, but al&s;o at affecting their Hearts, and infu&s;ing into them a De&s;ire of experiencing tho&s;e Comforts, their Judgment is informed true Religion will produce. In this main Point, viz. The affecting the Hearts of Children, all the Pieces calculated for their In&s;truction, I have hitherto met with, are very defective. The many Catechitical Tracts

publi&s;hed by Divines of our own Church, however u&s;eful to tho&s;e of riper Years, and maturer Judgments, are but very few of them &s;uited to the Capacities of Children; which all who have the Care of Youth mu&s;t ob&s;erve, can|not be otherwi&s;e in&s;tructed than by <HI>Precept upon Precept, and Line upon Line, here a little and there a little.</HI> The few that are profe&s;&s;edly wrote for the Edification of Young Ones, if they &s;ucceed in the fir&s;t Part, viz. in &s;toring the Mind with a Set of Principles, are very deficient in the latter, viz. in affecting their Hearts. For, however <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">trange it may &s;eem to &s;ome, yet Experience &s;hews us, that grown Per&s;ons, as well as Children, may have very ortho|dox Principles or Notions in their Heads, and yet at the &s;ame Time be de&s;titute of the lea&s;t Spark of Grace in their Hearts.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>You are told how Je&s;us Chri&s;t loved the Children of Men, and pitied poor Sinners, and became their Saviour; and what Pains and Sorrows our dear Saviour went through, to &s;ave his dear Children from Hell, and to bring them to Heaven.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>O Methinks, you long to know. You are eager to hear what Je&s;us Chri&s;t did, and
<PB N="16" REF="010142_0008_0F7D1C4C65F02C68">
what Way he takes to &s;ave and make happy his dear Children.</P>
<P>You know I told you before, that we are all, of us become &s;o unlike God, by Rea&s;on of Sin, that we are unfit to go to God and Heaven. Well then, Je&s;us Chri&s;t came down from Hea|ven to Earth, to fetch us from the Earth to Heaven.</P>
<P>O, what Love is this! as we read in God's Book, 2 Epi&s;t. Cor. chap. 8. ver. 9. of <HI>the Grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who, tho' he was rich, yet for your Sake became poor, that ye through his Poverty might be made rich.</HI> How poor did Je&s;us become? Why he that was Lord of all became a poor de&s;pi&s;ed out-ca&s;t Babe. He took our Nature upon him, and was born into this World.</P>
<P>O he looked down from the Heaven of his Glory; he &s;aw how Sin and Wickedne&s;s had ruined the dear Children of Men, and his loving Heart was &s;et upon them, and he would come to &s;ave them; therefore he was born into this World, under all the Meanne&s;s, Poverty &amp; Di&s;|grace which our Sins had de&s;erved. His Pa|rents were poor and mean: His Birth, in&s;tead of a Palace was a Stable: For a Cradle, a Man|ger, where Oxen fed, was the Place where the Lord of Life and Glory was fir&s;t laid. O what Love, what Humility is this!</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="010142_0008_0F7D1C4C65F02C68">Now all this is to &s;hew us what &s;hame is due to Sin. Think of this dear little Children. See the Shame of Sin. See how low our Savi|our &s;toop'd, how poor he became. Have you any Rea&s;on to be proud, and to love, and de|&s;ire the great and grand Things of this World? O learn of your Saviour to de&s;pi&s;e them.</P>
<P>Well, thus our dear Lord appeared in the Fle&s;h, in our Nature, in our Stead. Thus he became a Child for the Sake of dear little Chil|dren, that he might be their dear Brother and loving Saviour.</P>
<P>For your Sakes your Saviour begins his Life with Poverty and Di&s;grace; and as he grows up, his Sorrows and Sufferings increa&s;e with his Years. He had very few Friends that loved him. A great many Enemies that hated him. Few, very few, believed on him: He always went about doing Good: And yet he was al|ways &s;uffering Evil from the Children of Men.</P>
<P>He indeed was a Man of Sorrows, and ac|quainted with Griefs, all his Life for your Sakes: All that he bore, all that he &s;uffered, was in Love to his dear Children. His Life was a Life of Holine&s;s and Love; and yet wicked Men agreed to take away his dear Life, to &s;pill his precious Blood, and to murder this dear Savi|our of ours.</P>
<P>O you may read how he is preparing for the Hour, the di&s;mal Hour of his Death and Suffer|ings,
<PB N="18" REF="010142_0009_0F7D1C4D8DB64100">
in St. <HI>Luke,</HI> chap. 22. ver. 44. &s;ee him in the Garden of <HI>Geth&s;emane,</HI> there in great Pain and Sorrow, he prayed to his Father; and what think you, my dear Children, was the Cau&s;e of all his Di&s;tre&s;s? O he feels the Load, he bears the Weight of all his dear Children's Sins upon him. He had no Sin of his own; but he un|dertook our Cau&s;e, and all our Sins were laid upon his dear and innocent Head.</P>
<P>O this makes him groan, this makes him pray in the greate&s;t Agony; they cau&s;ed him to &s;weat and groan, and bleed; yea to &s;weat Drops, great Drops of precious Blood out of his inno|cent Veins.</P>
<P>O dear little Children, think of this; con&s;ider what your loving Saviour once &s;uffered for your Sins, for your Sakes, for your Souls; and this was on a dark Winter's Night, when the Air was &s;harp, fro&s;ty and cold.</P>
<P>O what great pains mu&s;t your Sins put your dear Saviour to, to make him thus &s;weat, as i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> were, great Drops of Blood falling from his Body to the Ground. O what an Agony, wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a grievous Agony of Sorrow and Grief doth he feel! O how well did our Saviour love little Children.</P>
<P>But this is not all; no &s;ooner were his Pray+ers ended, but greater Sorrows, and more grie+vous Pains are coming upon him; tho' he had gone up and down for near thirty Years, doin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="19" REF="010142_0009_0F7D1C4D8DB64100">
Good, and was always loving &amp; tender-hearted to all that came unto him: Yet O how barba|rou&s;ly is he u&s;ed? for a great Multitude of rude, wicked Men come with Lanthorns and Staves, to take him.</P>
<P>O the dear, innocent Lamb! How is he de|livered up to the Anger and Fury of Men, who like Lions and Bears, drag him away to the Governor of the City, and they tied tho&s;e dear Hands behind him, which had been &s;o often put forth to give Sight to the Blind, to cure the Sick, to give Life to the Dead, and had em|braced little Children, when he ble&s;&s;ed them, and al&s;o been very often lifted up in Prayer to his Father, for his Enemies.</P>
<P>Thus bound he &s;tood before his Judge &s;ilent, tho' they laid many Things to his Charge, of which he was innocent, he &s;aid nothing; O, no: He knew he appeared in our Stead; we were guilty, and for our Sins he &s;uffered.</P>
<P>But his Sufferings are not at an End yet; O no: Our Sins were laid upon him; for them he mu&s;t bleed; for them he is willing to &s;hed every Drop of his precious Blood. We were &s;old, all of us, my dear little Children, as Slaves to Sin and Satan; and nothing but Blood, the Blood of Je&s;us, the Blood of God, could buy our Liberty.</P>
<P>Chri&s;t freely gave him&s;elf for us: he hath bought us with his own Blood, and redeemed
<PB N="20" REF="010142_0010_0F7D1C4DEC189AD0">
us from being Enemies to God, and Slaves to Wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P>O then &s;ee, mark the Account, which is gi|ven of our dear Saviour after he was condemn|ed to die.</P>
<P>His cruel Enemies led him away, and they &s;courged him with Cords, till they cut deep Ga&s;hes on his naked Body.</P>
<P>Then they made a Crown of Thorns, which were &s;harp pointed like a Sword. This they put on his dear &s;acred Head, and &s;mote upon it, till they forced the Points into the Temples of his Head; and the Blood trickled down his innocent Face.</P>
<P>Thus he was wounded from Head to Foot. And why was this done? but on Account of our &s;ad State and mi&s;erable Condition, as God's Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> &s;ets it forth, chap. 1. ver. 6. our whole Head is &s;ick, our whole Heart is faint; from the Sole of the Foot, even unto the Head, there is no &s;ound Part in us; but we are all fu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l of Wounds and Brui&s;es &amp; putrifying Sores.</P>
<P>So our dear Je&s;us was wounded from Head to Foot; that by his S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ripes and Blood, we might be healed of all the Sickne&s;&s;es of our Souls.</P>
<P>Thus the Blood trickled down from every Part of his innocent Body; and yet this doth not &s;atisfy the cruel Rage of his Enemies; for they &s;pit upon him, they mocked him, and made Game of him.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="010142_0010_0F7D1C4DEC189AD0">O how ea&s;y could our dear Saviour have look|ed them dead, and frowned them into Hell in a Moment; but no, we &s;ee he is patient &amp; meek; he opens not his Mouth, neither doth he cry nor complain.</P>
<P>O what Love, what Patience is this! never was the like &s;een before! But yet more &amp; more of his Love for Sinners is to be &s;een, and more of his Sufferings is &s;till to come.</P>
<P>Die he mu&s;t. He is condemned: And there|fore they drag him away. They lay his heavy Cro&s;s upon his naked, wounded Body, which he carries till he is faint and tired. All about him were his Enemies laughing, and mocking him, until he comes in Sight of mount Calvary. Thither he goes up, and his Cro&s;s being laid on the Ground, they &s;tretch out his dear Arms wide. Thro' the Palms of his holy, tender Hands&punc; and thro' his &s;acred Feet, they drive large Nails, and &s;o fa&s;ten him to the Cro&s;s; and then lifted it up from the Ground. Thus the dear Lord Je&s;us hangs on the accur&s;ed Tree.</P>
<P>Is not this enough to make your dear little Hearts ake, and cau&s;e you to weep and cry, to think of his Pains and Agonies? And yet, O how cruel and hard hearted are Men! They &s;ee him and they wag their Heads. They look on him thus, in the greate&s;t Pain; and they had no Pity, no Mercy on him; but they &s;till mocked, &s;till laughed at him. O the Racks

<P>O what heavenly Love! what a &s;weet for|giving Temper was our dear Saviour of! He &s;eems to forget all his own mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing Pains; and is more concerned for his very Murderers, than for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>O what Pain mu&s;t it be to hang but a few Minutes on the Cro&s;s. But Je&s;us hung thu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in the greate&s;t Pain and Agony, for full three Hours! No Eye pitied him; no one off<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">red him any Comfort; no, even God his dear Fa|ther, who &s;aid, <HI>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well plea&s;ed,</HI> now pours forth the Fury of his Wrath, and fierce&s;t Anger upon him.

<P>At la&s;t, behold a Soldier &s;tabs a &s;harp-pointed Spear into his precious Side, &s;o that he &s;hed his deare&s;t Heart's Blood for our Sins.</P>
<P>Thus wearied out with Pain and Sorrow, and Agony, &s;uch as Man never felt before, ju&s;t be|fore he gave up the Gho&s;t and died, he bowed his Head to the Earth, as much as to &s;ay to us

<ARGUMENT>
<P>A very pretty Story of a dear little Child, who loved her Saviour; in which you are told, how good &s;he was, how holy and happy &s;he lived, and how comfortably &s;he died.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>BUt fir&s;t, let me tell you of your dear School-Fellow: O how &s;oon was &s;he took &s;ick and died! &s;he came from School on Saturday, well as you be now; the next Day the Fever &s;eiz'd her; before the Week was ended, Death had laid his cold Hand upon, and made her a pale, breathle&s;s Corp&s;e.</P>
<P>Now you know her Father had a great deal of Money to have given her, and many fin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Cloaths, but none of the&s;e could &s;ave her from dying&punc; O but it was happy for her, &s;he loved her Savi|our better than a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l the&s;e, and &s;he always took more Delight &amp; Plea&s;ure in going to her Saviour, and praying to him than in any Thing el&s;e in all the World: And you would do the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me, if you did but love our Saviour, and knew that he loved you. As &s;oon as &s;he got up in the Morn|ing, the fir&s;t Thing &s;he did, was to go and pray to her dear Saviour, after this Manner:</P>
<P><HI>O my dear and only Saviour, my Lord and my God; what Care do&s;t thou take of thy dear little Child? Lord, I thank thee for all thy Love, and for all thy Goodne&s;s to me Dear Je&s;us give me to know more and more of thy Love! O &s;hed thy
<PB N="28" REF="010142_0014_0F7D1C556AC92BB8" MS="y">
Love abroad in my Heart! O be my Saviour! Save me this Day from my own naughty wicked Heart. Save me from this evil World. Dear Saviour, &s;ave me from my great Enemy the Devil. O that I may bate Sin, and love and &s;erve thee all my Days, till Death comes; and then dear Je&s;us, after I have thus come unto thee, and loved thee on Earth, O take my Soul up to thy Self in Glory, to prai&s;e thee for ever and ever.</HI></P>
<P>And when &s;he came from School, when other Children are only minding their Play; O &s;he was glad to get by her&s;elf, and to go to her dear Sa|viour, and pray to him; and he always heard her and gave her every Thing that &s;he wanted.</P>
<P>O how glad was he when the Lord's Day came that &s;he might go and pray with God's People, and hear God's Mini&s;ters preach about Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and his Love to poor Sinners! Whenever &s;he &s;aw any poor People in the Streets, that wanted Victuals and Cloaths, her Heart pitied them; and &s;he was glad if &s;he had any Thing to give them.</P>
<P>She was very dutiful to her Parents, very lov|ing to all her Brothers and Si&s;ters; yea, &s;he lived in Love with every Body.</P>
<P>Thus &s;he lived happy, for &s;he knew her Savi|our loved her; &s;he knew he died for her Sins; &s;he knew &s;he was God almighty's Child, and that he had forgiven all her Sins; for he had given her to know this by his ble&s;&s;ed Spirit

<P>FRom what I have before told you, you learnt That you are all Sinners, That you was born into a naughty World, with a wicked Heart within you, and an unholy Nature about you&punc; &s;o that you have no Goodne&s;s, no Righteou&s;|ne&s;s, no Strength in your &s;elves; and therefore you are always in danger of being led into Sin and Wickedne&s;s by the Devil, who is your Ene|my. He is a wicked Spirit, and he tries by all Means to tempt dear Children to commit Sin to take God's Name in vain, to hate one ano|ther, to tell lies, to break God's Sabbath? yea every Thing that God would not have you to do he will tempt you to do. So that you are told by God's Apo&s;tle, 1 <HI>Peter, chap. ver.</HI> 8 <HI>That your Adver&s;ary, the Devil, as a roaring Lion walketh about, &s;eeking whom he may devour.</HI></P>

<P>O then don't you &s;ee, dear Children your Danger?

<P>O I know a great many dear Children that were once very naughty, wicked Sinners, &amp; had nothing but Rags, filthy Rags to cover them&s;elves with, &amp; to hide their Nakedne&s;s from the Sight of God; and as &s;oon as they &s;aw and knew their Poverty, and their Nakedne&s;s, O they went to our dear Saviour, and prayed to him, and con|fe&s;&s;ed their Wants, and he gave them a Change of Raiment; he took away their Rags, &amp; gave them the beautiful Dre&s;s, and &s;potle&s;s Robe of his perfect Righteou&s;ne&s;s; and as &s;oon as ever they were thus cloathed with the Garment of their elder Brother's Righteou&s;ne&s;s, then God looked upon them, then God owned them as his Children.</P>
