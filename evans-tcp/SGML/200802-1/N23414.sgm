<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_THE en&s;uing di&s;cour&s;e, as is u&s;ually &s;aid, was ha&s;t|ily compo&s;ed without any thought of its being made public; which is now done at the repeated &s;olicit|ations of many of the hearers. And the purport of it is to &s;hew, that the commi&s;&s;ion Chri&s;t gave his apo&s;tles, and the religion he impowered them to teach, does not in the lea&s;t infringe that equality which GOD had be|fore e&s;tabli&s;hed among all the human race.</P>
<P>It has long appeared to the author, that all rule and dominion&mdash;all authority, power and government, under whatever form, either in church or &s;tate, which does not originate from the free choice of the people, is u&s;urped, and ought to be held in the utmo&s;t contempt indignation and abhorance! And that our Saviour has guaranteed and &s;ecured the natural equality of men by expre&s;s precepts; as, <HI>Be not ye called Rabbi; for one it your Ma&s;ter, even Chri&s;t; and all ye are brethren,</HI> &amp;c. It is accordingly attempted to be proved in the following pages, that Chri&s;t gave his apo&s;tles no au|thority or dominion over mankind, but only &s;imply commi&s;&s;ioned them to baptize men, and teach them to ob&s;erve what&s;oever HE him&s;elf had taught; and that the commi&s;&s;ion intended to be continued to the end of the world, contains nothing more. The con&s;equence of which is, that a man cannot have any power or au|thority in the church any more than he can in the &s;tate unle&s;s he derives it from the people!</P>

<Q><BIBL><HI>MATTHEW, XXVIII&mdash;From the 17th to the 20th.</HI></BIBL>
<P>And when they &s;aw him, they wor&s;hipped him; but &s;ome doubted. And Je&s;us came and &s;pake to them, &s;aying, all power is given unto me in Heaven and in Earth. Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t: teaching them to ob&s;erve all things what&s;o|ever I have commanded you. And lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the world. Amen.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHILE we celebrate the birth day of this Je&s;us, 'tis proper to con&s;ider, fir&s;t, who he was?</P>
<P>Secondly&mdash;For what purpo&s;e he came into our world?</P>
<P>And Thirdly&mdash;By what means the end of his coming is to be accompli&s;hed?</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then we enquire, Who he was?</P>
<P>THE Di&s;ciples, who &s;aw him after his re&s;urrection, believed him to be GOD, as well as man: for when they &s;aw him they wor&s;hipped him.&mdash;Well aware that they ought not to wor&s;hip any but God and fully convin|ced, by his ri&s;ing on the third day, according to his promi&s;e that he was GOD, they wor&s;hipped him. But &s;ome doubted.&mdash;Ob&s;erving this, Je&s;us came&mdash;(that is came nearer)&mdash;and &s;pake to them, &s;aying, all power is given unto me in Heaven and in Earth.&mdash;Go teach and baptize all nations, and I will be with you to the end of the world&mdash;I will &s;upport you in the execution of your office&mdash;I will give &s;ufficient proof, by the works I will enable you to do, that I have &s;ent you and that indeed I <HI>have</HI> all power in Heaven and in Earth.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="030992_0005_0FEA1E4BC6023928">WE learn from the other Evangeli&s;ts, that Je&s;us, on this occa&s;ion, promi&s;ed the miraculous gifts of the Holy Gho&s;t; the fulfilment of which promi&s;e, together with his own re&s;urrection, abundantly demon&s;trated that he was GOD And if it was indeed a fact, that he did ri&s;e from the dead; and if it was al&s;o a fact, that he did, according to his promi&s;e, enable his di&s;ciples to work miracles.&mdash;(and it &s;eems &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible that men could be impo&s;ed on in &s;uch plain matters of facts) if the&s;e things, I &s;ay, were facts, it mu&s;t be that he was what he pretended, and had all power in Heaven and in Earth. We may therefore &s;afely conclude that he was GOD&mdash;We proceed then to the &s;econd inquiry: For what purpo&s;e did he come into <HI>our</HI> world?</P>
<P>HIS name <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> &s;ingnifies a Saviour. The Angel who foretold his birth, called his name Je&s;us, becau&s;e he &s;hould &s;ave his people from their &s;ins.</P>
<P>AND he him&s;elf tells us that he came&mdash;to call &s;inners to repentance.</P>
<P>HE gave him&s;elf for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto him&s;elf a peculiar people zealous of good works.</P>
<P>HE &s;uffered,&mdash;the ju&s;t for the unju&s;t, that he might bring us to GOD.&mdash;Who &s;o loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that who&s;oever believeth in him &s;hould not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting life.</P>
<P>THE wretched and mi&s;erable &s;tate of Man, after he had tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the divine law, moved the eternal fountain of compa&s;&s;ion and mercy to contrive a way for man's recovery; to make atonement for &s;in; to procure us pardon and acceptance with GOD, and to bring us to that eternal glory and happine&s;s for which human nature was fir&s;t intended!&mdash;But the di|vinity of our Saviour, and the end and de&s;ign of his coming into the world, are matters &s;o well under&s;tood, that I need not take up much of your time on <HI>the&s;e</HI> heads.&mdash;What I chiefly intend at this time, is to con|&s;ider the means by which <HI>that end</HI> is to be accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="030992_0006_0FEA1E4F1117FA00">THE death and &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t are the only cau&s;e of the pardon of &s;in; but as the pardon of &s;in is but a part of the de&s;ign of his incarnation, other means are yet to be u&s;ed. <HI>Men are to be made fit</HI> to be par|takers of the inheritance of the Saints in light: And to accompli&s;h this part of the de&s;ign he has in&s;tituted a religion; founded a church in the world, and commi&s;|&s;ioned an order of men to make di&s;ciples to him, to baptize them, and teach them to ob&s;erve all things what&s;oever <HI>he</HI> hath commanded. What we call the Chri&s;tian religion is therefore a matter of great importance to mankind. Ob&s;erving the in&s;titu|tions of it; living according to the rules and precepts of it; is, &s;o far as we know, the only means of e&s;caping eter|nal ruin, and being qualified for the enjoyment of ev|erla&s;ting happine&s;s.</P>
<P>THE commi&s;&s;ion therefore which Chri&s;t gave his Apo&s;tles, being the only means of conveying to us the knowledge of this religion; and tho&s;e who refu&s;e to comply with what that commi&s;&s;ion empowered them to require, being threatened with damnation; it concerns us to enquire into the nature and import of that commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>HAD the Apo&s;tles taken it into their heads to require &s;omething which their commi&s;&s;ion did not warrant, there could have been no harm in refu&s;ing to &s;ubmit to it. We find indeed that they have not done this; but 'tis more than probable that &s;ome of their &s;ucce&s;|ors have.</P>
<P>SOME who call them&s;elves the Apo&s;tles' &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, have exerci&s;ed powers and authority which Chri&s;t nev|er gave his Apo&s;tles, and which <HI>they</HI> never did and never could give to any body el&s;e; for it is certain they could not give others more power than they had them&s;elves; but 'tis not certain that they gave them quite &s;o much.</P>
<P>THAT the commi&s;&s;ion which Chri&s;t gave his Apo&s;|tles had no reference to one place or di&s;trict more than
<PB N="8" REF="030992_0007_0FEA1E50BA626558">
another is evident from the very <HI>words</HI> of my text. <HI>Go ye and teach all nations,</HI> or as St. Mark records it; <HI>Go into all the world and preach the Go&s;pel to every crea|ture.</HI> All <HI>power,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>in Heaven and in Earth</HI> is giv|en unto ME; <HI>I</HI> therefore, by virtue of this power, <HI>&s;end you</HI>;&mdash;not to be lords over particular di&s;tricts&mdash;nor indeed to be lords over any body; but to teach and baptize&mdash;to teach what&s;oever <HI>I</HI> have commanded you; and to enable you to do this, ye &s;hall receive the Holy Gho&s;t, who &s;hall bring to your remembrance what&s;o|ever I have taught you. And I will my&s;elf inflict dam|nation on tho&s;e who refu&s;e to believe that Go&s;pel I &s;end you to preach. I will &s;till hold all power in my own hands; and to overcome the oppo&s;ition which my Go&s;|pel will meet with at its fir&s;t &s;etting out in the world; I will, by the Holy Gho&s;t, enable you to &s;peak with new tongues&mdash;di&s;cern &s;pirits, and work miracles.</P>
<P>IT appears then that the Apo&s;tles' commi&s;&s;ion em|powered them to do no more than baptize men, and declare to them the will of their ma&s;ter. And le&s;t they &s;hould attempt to to exerci&s;e lord&s;hip and autho|rity over their <HI>fellow-creatures</HI>; he more than once ex|pre&s;sly forbids it. <HI>Be not ye called ma&s;ters&mdash;it &s;hall not be &s;o among you!</HI></P>
<P>AND as the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> had no juri&s;diction, or authority over particular di&s;tricts, &s;o neither did they pretend to give any body el&s;e. As they were not placed over particular pari&s;hes them&s;elves, &s;o neither did they ever place any body el&s;e over any.</P>
<P>AND further: As they had no power to di&s;card or &s;i|lence any of their brethren, &s;o neither did they, or could they, give any &s;uch power to their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors!</P>
<P>THE arguments on which the contrary opinion is grounded, are chiefly drawn from the ca&s;e of Timothy at Ephe&s;us. And Titus at Crete.&mdash;We are told, in the po&s;tcripts to the Epi&s;tles to Timothy and Titus, that they were ordained Bi&s;hops, the one over Ephe&s;us, and the other over Crete.&mdash;Who ordained them is a
<PB N="9" REF="030992_0008_0FEA1E53F21D29A0">
que&s;tion. We have no evidence that Paul did it: much le&s;s that he ordained them over the&s;e di&s;tricts. St. Paul indeed when he wrote his fir&s;t Epi&s;tle to Timothy, be&s;ought him to abide &s;till at Ephe&s;us, while he [Paul] went into Macedonia. But it does not follow from this, that Timothy was at Ephe&s;us when that epi&s;tle was written; much le&s;s that Paul had placed him over that di&s;trict. I did at a certain time, &s;ays Paul, be&s;eech thee to abide &s;till there; which &s;hews that the Apo&s;tle did not authoratively place him there. Had Timothy been ordained by an Apo&s;tle over Ephe&s;us, and had he believed the Apo&s;tle had power &s;o to ordain him, he would have &s;tayed there very cheerfully, let him have had ever &s;o many, and ever &s;o great CALLS, to get el&s;e|where! So that the Apo&s;tle need not have <HI>be&s;ought</HI> him to abide there.</P>
<P>BUT it is added that Paul in his &s;econd Epi&s;tle, en|joins Timothy to &s;tir up the gift of GOD that was in him, by the putting on of the Apo&s;tle's hands; which &s;hews, they &s;ay, that Paul ordained him.</P>
<P>BUT to this, I an&s;wer: that the gift here mention|ed was probably <HI>not</HI> the commi&s;&s;ion of a Go&s;pel Mini&s;|ter, becau&s;e there appears an impropriety in requiring him to <HI>&s;tir it up.</HI> Should any one &s;ay to me; come Sir, you don't <HI>&s;tir up</HI> your <HI>commi&s;&s;ion!</HI> You mu&s;t <HI>&s;tir up the commi&s;&s;ion</HI> that is in you by the laying on of the hands of the <HI>Bi&s;hop;</HI> I &s;hould not think he &s;poke properly!</P>
<P>BUT if we ob&s;erve that the Holy Gho&s;t is frequently in Scripture called <HI>fire,</HI>&mdash;and that this fire was convey|ed by the laying on of the Apo&s;tles' hands; there ap|pears a peculiar propriety in requiring Timothy to &s;tir up that gift.&mdash;<HI>The &s;pirit of the Prophets is &s;ubject to Prophets.</HI>&mdash;A man who had the miraculous gift of the Holy Gho&s;t could exerci&s;e that gift or let it alone. But you know how it is with fire, to make it &s;hine and give heat, you mu&s;t &s;tir it up. The gift was from GOD conveyed by the hands of Paul, but the exerci&s;e of
<PB N="10" REF="030992_0009_0FEA1E57805576E8">
that gift was the bu&s;ine&s;s of Timothy. So far then was Paul from ordaining Timothy <HI>over</HI> Ephe&s;us that he did not ordain him at all. And the directions given to Timothy re&s;pecting the qualifications of a Bi&s;hop and Deacon, and the manner of receiving an accu&s;ation a|gain&s;t an Elder, do not concern Timothy as <HI>Bi&s;hop of Ephe&s;us</HI>; but that <HI>he might know how he ought to behave in the Hou&s;e of GOD. Which is, &s;ays he, the Church of the</HI> LIVING GOD: That is, the univer&s;al Church. <HI>In</HI> this great hou&s;e Timothy had a great deal of work to do. Accordingly Paul calls on him to endure afflictions; to make full proof of his mini&s;try, and do the work of an Evangeli&s;t; which &s;eems hardly compatible with <HI>fattening in a Dioce&s;e.</HI> For the work of an Evangeli&s;t was to travel from place to place, to propogate and e&s;|tabli&s;h the Chri&s;tian faith wherever occa&s;ion and op|portunity offered. St. Paul had run the &s;ame cour&s;e, and had, as he &s;ays, now fini&s;hed it; and calls on Ti|mothy and Titus to do as he had done. It further appears that Timothy was <HI>not</HI> bi&s;hop of Ephe&s;us, from the 20th of Acts; where we find him with Paul on his travels. And we find al&s;o Paul &s;ending from Miletus and calling the elders of Ephe&s;us, and in&s;tructing them in their duty; which we pre&s;ume he need not have done, if Timo|thy had been &s;ettled <HI>there</HI> for life, as <HI>over&s;eer of tho&s;e over&s;eers.</HI> At this time Timothy did not re&s;ide at E|phe&s;us; and he was not there when Paul wrote his <HI>&s;e|cond</HI> epi&s;tle to him; neither do I believe he was there when the apo&s;tle wrote his <HI>fir&s;t</HI> epi&s;tle to him. Timo|thy then was not bi&s;hop of Ephe&s;us!</P>
<P>Let us next &s;ee how the ca&s;e was with Titus, who, we are told, was ordained the fir&s;t bi&s;hop of the Cre|tians. Poor Cretians! they did not enjoy their bi&s;hop but a little while! For we find Paul reque&s;ting him to come to him at Nicopolis; and the year after, in his la&s;t epi&s;tle to Timothy, he tells us, Titus had depart|ed to Dalmatia. Paul therefore did not ordain <HI>Titus</HI> bi&s;hop <HI>over</HI> Crete, he only <HI>left</HI> him <HI>in</HI> Crete, that he
<PB N="11" REF="030992_0010_0FEA1E5919C29AC0">
might &s;et in order the things which were wanting and ordain elders <HI>in</HI> every City. What a pity it is, the apo&s;tle had not &s;aid, "ordain elders <HI>over</HI> every city!" By their wanting elders or pre&s;byters <HI>in every</HI> city, it &s;eems there was not one prie&s;t on the I&s;land when Paul left it; to &s;upply that defect, and &s;ome others not men|tioned, Titus was left in Crete; and when he had ac|compli&s;hed the bu&s;ine&s;s, he left Crete and travelled on.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Doctor WHITBY ob&s;erves; that Timothy and Titus are never called bi&s;hops of Ephe&s;us and Crete by any writer of the three fir&s;t centuries. But &s;ays the learned Doctor, that defect is abundantly &s;upplied by the &s;uffrages of the fourth and fifth centuries. Then, I &s;uppo&s;e, the po&s;t&s;crips were written.</NOTE></P>
<P>BUT it will be a&s;ked; does not the apo&s;tle call the elders of Ephe&s;us <HI>over&s;eers?</HI> And does not this imply that they had <HI>authority</HI> over their flocks? And did not <HI>Timothy ordain</HI> the&s;e over&s;eers; and by <HI>ordaining</HI> them, gave them the over&s;ight of their particular flocks? To this I an&s;wer, <HI>I know not what rea&s;on we have to &s;uppo&s;e that Timothy ordained them?</HI> But if he <HI>did;</HI> his ordaining them did nothing towards making them over&s;eers: becau&s;e the Apo&s;tle &s;ays the Holy Gho&s;t made them over|&s;eers. And 'tis probable the&s;e over&s;eers were able to give &s;ome proof of their having received their authority from the Holy Gho&s;t; otherwi&s;e their flocks would have had too much &s;en&s;e to regard them. But what were the&s;e over&s;eers to do? Nothing more than <HI>feed</HI> the Church of GOD! Not thre&s;h the members of it with an <HI>iron flail. Feeding</HI> the church of GOD being a dif|ferent thing from <HI>governing</HI> it, which makes it proba|ble that the&s;e over&s;eers were <HI>not</HI> governors; but if they were, 'twas the Holy Gho&s;t who made them &s;uch, and not bi&s;hop Timothy. Their ruling and governing powers&punc; if they had any, were not derived from Chri&s;t by virtue of the commi&s;&s;ion <HI>he</HI> gave his Apo&s;tles, and which he intended &s;hould be continued to the end of the world; but the&s;e powere were imparted to them
<PB N="12" REF="030992_0011_0FEA1E5C10E38068">
by the Holy Ghost and did not belong to their commi&s;|&s;ion as go&s;pel mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>THE peculiar circum&s;tances of the church at that time, required gifts and powers, which were not ne|ce&s;&s;ary in after ages&mdash;accordingly he gave Apo&s;tles, Evangeli&s;ts, Prophets, Pa&s;tors, Teachers, Governors, Helpers&mdash;Speakers with tongues, Interpreters of tongues, De&s;cerners of &s;pirits, Workers of miracules &amp;c. &amp;c. All which offices, gifts and powers, cea&s;ed when the church was e&s;tabli&s;hed in the world; and can never exi&s;t again, unle&s;s it &s;hall plea&s;e GOD again to pour out his &s;pirit upon all fle&s;h as he did in that day.</P>
<P>BUT what &s;ays Paul to Timothy? A Bi&s;hop, or o|ver&s;eer, mu&s;t be one that <HI>ruleth</HI> well his own hou&s;e&mdash; for if a man know not how to <HI>rule</HI> his own hou&s;e; how &s;hall he <HI>take care of</HI> the Church of GOD! <HI>Take care of it!</HI>&mdash; Alas; what a pity it is, the Apo&s;tle had not &s;aid, how &s;hall he <HI>rule</HI> the Church of GOD. We find then nothing in the New Te&s;tament that an|&s;wers to the modern idea of &s;piritual rulers&punc; and Eccle|&s;ia&s;tical Governors!</P>
<P>WHAT then! &mdash;you will &s;ay &mdash;are we in this age, to have no church government! no di&s;cipline! &mdash; who &s;hall judge, cen&s;ure and excommunicate offenders! who &s;hall di&s;card and &s;ilence a wicked Mini&s;ter!&mdash;</P>
<P>To &s;olve this we mu&s;t look back to the XVII chapter of St. Matt. (and 'tis wi&s;hed that every body would read that chapter) where we had our Lord in&s;tructing his di&s;ciples in the bu&s;ine&s;s of di&s;cipline. If thy brother tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t thee, go &amp; tell him his fault between thee and him alone; if he hear thee, thou ha&s;t gained thy brother; but if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witne&s;&s;es every word may be e&s;tabli&s;hed. And if he neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be to thee as a heathen man, and a publican.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="030992_0012_0FEA1E5DAFB2A9B0">THERE will be no difficulty in under&s;tanding <HI>this,</HI> if we can only determine what is <HI>here</HI> meant by the word CHURCH. And if men were le&s;t to the dictates of common &s;en&s;e, they doubtle&s;s <HI>would</HI> under&s;tand it ju&s;t as our Lord intended. The word Church, is in|deed, in different places, u&s;ed in different &s;en&s;es; but 'tis mo&s;t natural to &s;uppo&s;e, our Lord <HI>here</HI> meant by it the congregation, or &s;ociety, to which the offending brother belongs. He &s;urely did not mean to &s;end us to Rome! He did not mean that we &s;hould cro&s;s the At|lantic; nor ride po&s;tha&s;te to New London; nor call a con&s;ociation. He doubtle&s;s intended that his di&s;ciples, in all parts of the world, as many as can convenient|ly, &s;hould meet together in one place to wor&s;hip GOD.

<P>PUNISHING an offending brother with death, or with bodily di&s;ea&s;es&mdash;or remitting and retaining &s;ins, binding &amp; loo&s;ing, inflicting corporeal or pecuniary pun|i&s;hment

&mdash;is no part of the church's bu&s;ine&s;s at <HI>this day.</HI> Whatever of this kind has ever been done by divine authority, has been done by immediate in&s;piration. And the Pope is &s;o far in the right: fir&s;t to pretend to infallibility, before he undertakes to remit and retain &s;ins, or to puni&s;h heretics. For even that injunction to <HI>bi&s;hop</HI> Titus&mdash;(after the fir&s;t and &s;econd admonition) to <HI>reject</HI> a heretic, required and &s;uppo&s;ed in&s;piration in <HI>Titus.</HI> Becau&s;e the Apo&s;tle <HI>there</HI> &s;ays, a heretic is one who is &s;elf condemned; which is impo&s;&s;ible to be known without in&s;piration. And thus we &s;ee who is to judge, cen&s;ure and excomunicate offenders. <HI>'Tis the church or congregation to which the offender belongs.</HI></P>
<P>But &s;till you will repeat, and reiterate the que&s;tion: Who &s;hall di&s;card and &s;ilence a wicked <HI>mini&s;ter?</HI> Why, we have already ob&s;erved, that the mini&s;ter is &s;ubject to the &s;ame <HI>law</HI> with the re&s;t of the congrega|tion: we know no di&s;tinction!</P>
<P>But &s;till, you &s;ay, St. <HI>Paul</HI> in&s;tructed <HI>bi&s;hop Timothy</HI> how to receive an accu&s;ation again&s;t an offending <HI>elder,</HI> or prie&s;t. 'Tis true he did &s;o: but we have &s;hewn that Timothy was an <HI>evangeli&s;t,</HI> had in&s;piration,&mdash;and <HI>more power</HI> than go&s;pel mini&s;ters <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Alas for the POWER!&mdash;Why don't they cure Joe Mudge?</NOTE> at this day. But even <HI>Timothy</HI> with all <HI>his power,</HI> could do nothing about &s;i|lencing a wicked mini&s;ter. All he could do was only to <HI>rebuke!</HI> Them who &s;in, <HI>rebuke;</HI> &s;ays the apo&s;tle. Why hid he not &s;ay; hang them up; put them down; turn them out; unordain them; take away their com|mi&s;&s;ion!</P>
<P>The apo&s;tle well knew that the commi&s;&s;ion origina|ted from Chri&s;t, and none but he could take it away. And the ordainer, <HI>if he is any thing,</HI> is the in&s;trument of conveyance only. If the commi&s;&s;ion originates from Chri&s;t, although the ordainer <HI>does</HI> convey it, yet he can not take it away. No power, &s;hort of that from which the commi&s;&s;ion originates is &s;ufficient to
<PB N="15" REF="030992_0014_0FEA1E65F7E595E8">
<HI>recall it.</HI>&mdash;He, <HI>who has all power in heaven and in earth, might</HI> have ordered, that his mini&s;ters &s;hould uncom|mi&s;&s;ionate one another; he <HI>might</HI> have done this, I &s;ay; but I deny that he <HI>has.</HI> As the ca&s;e now &s;tands; 'tis ju&s;t as if the Governor of the &s;tate &s;hould &s;end me, by one of this congregation, a commi&s;&s;ion to execute &s;ome office in the civil or military department; and the man who conveys and hands the commi&s;&s;ion, &s;hould take it into his head to recall it, and forbid me to act accord|ing to it. In that ca&s;e, I believe, you would all call me a fool, if I regarded him; unle&s;s he could prove that the power from which the commi&s;&s;ion i&s;&s;ued, had expre&s;sly ordered and empowered him to do &s;o.</P>
<P>How any man <HI>can,</HI> at this day become a go&s;pel mini&s;|ter? Is a que&s;tion we &s;hall not, at pre&s;ent, meddle with. But if he once has that commi&s;&s;ion, he may de|fy all the powers of earth and hell to take it away. If the ordainer conveys the commi&s;&s;ion, the man who has it, may go into the world, and teach and baptize, in de&s;pite of what the ordainer can do. If he is per|&s;ecuted in one city, he may flee to another. If any re|fu&s;e to receive, or hear him, he may &s;hake off his du&s;t, and pa&s;s on. He never can become the mini&s;ter of any <HI>particular pari&s;h,</HI> unle&s;s the people of that pari&s;h make a contract with him; and when they have done &s;o, all the <HI>powers</HI> under heaven cannot di&s;&s;olve that contract.&mdash;Not di&s;&s;olve it!&mdash;What then mu&s;t a congregation do, if their mini&s;ter turns wicked? They mu&s;t be in a woeful ea&s;e, if they cannot find &s;omebody to &s;ilence him! Don't be frightened friends!&mdash;A congregation, &s;o far as <HI>concerns them,</HI> may <HI>&s;ilence</HI> their own mini&s;ter, <HI>if they find ju&s;t cau&s;e.</HI> For, "if thy brother tre&s;&s;pa&s;s again&s;t thee, go and tell him his fault." &mdash;If thou finde&s;t aught again&s;t thy brother, who is a mini&s;ter, (and I advi&s;e thee to keep a good watch) go and tell him his fault&mdash;if nothing el&s;e will do; tell it to the church. Call the mini&s;ter and the congrega|tion together. And if it appears that he has not ful|filled
<PB N="16" REF="030992_0015_0FEA1E679AD245A0">
his part of the contract. If he has tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed what the go&s;pel makes his duty, and refu&s;es to be re|claimed; then let him be unto thee as a heathen man and a publican. The congregation, in that ca&s;e, may &s;afely put away from <HI>among them&s;elves</HI> that wicked per|&s;on: and &s;ufficient will be his puni&s;hment, which is inflicted by many.&mdash;Oh! but, you will &s;ay, that won't do; for he will draw his &s;alary &s;till. We &s;hall have him to pay during life, notwith&s;tanding all this! &mdash;Why &s;o!&mdash;Why, becau&s;e the law of the land im|powered the ordainer to place him over the pari&s;h; &amp; the &s;ame law impowers the ordainer to take him down again, and unordain him.&mdash;Ah indeed! &mdash; Is it the ci|vil law that impowers go&s;pel mini&s;ters to unordain one another!&mdash;I have long thought that they did not derive &s;uch power from Chri&s;t. And it &s;eems the legi&s;|lators thought &s;o too, or they would not have meddled with the matter.</P>
<P>If it be the civil power that <HI>makes</HI> a go&s;pel mini&s;ter; the civil power can, without doubt <HI>unmake</HI> him. &mdash; Or, if a man's having &s;uch and &s;uch qualifications authori|&s;es him to teach and baptize; then when he cea&s;es to have tho&s;e qualifications, he loo&s;es his authority. In either of <HI>the&s;e</HI> ca&s;es; for the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, as &s;uch, whether bi&s;hops or pre&s;byters, to pretend to &s;u&s;pend, or &s;ilence a mini&s;ter, is but a &s;olemn farce, a meer &s;ham, and de&s;erves no other notice but ridicule. So that choo&s;e what method you will to make a man a mini&s;ter; when once he <HI>is</HI> made, his brother mini&s;ters have no power over him. And he, by the law of Chri&s;t has no power over the people. All he can do by virtue of his commi&s;&s;ion as a go&s;pel mini&s;ter, is only to teach and baptize!&mdash;What! you will &s;ay; is it not the prie&s;t's bu&s;ine&s;s to admini&s;ter the Lord's &s;upper? Does not the apo&s;tle injoin the over&s;eers of Ephe&s;us to <HI>feed</HI> the church of God?&mdash;Yes: and they were to feed it as <HI>Paul had</HI> done. They were to feed it with milk; (the &s;incere milk of the word) if it could not bear &s;trong meat but not with bread and wine. The fact is; according
<PB N="17" REF="030992_0016_0FEA1E6984A4C050">
to the new te&s;tament there is no admini&s;tering about the Lord's &s;upper, and the prie&s;t has no more to do with it than any other chri&s;tian.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Con&s;ecrating the elements, differs only in degree from TRANSUBSTANTIATING them. The prie&s;t may as well, when his hand is in, perform the whole miracle, as a part of it. HE may as well convert the bread and wine into the body and blood of Chri&s;t, as, in ANY DEGREE, to change the nature of them!&mdash; &mdash;Whoever can believe that a prie&s;t, by taking the bread and cup into his hand; or by dipping his finger into the water of bapti&s;m, can make them any holier than they were before; may e'en go on, and belive all the ab&s;urdities of Popery. Whoe|ver can believe that a DEACON may PREACH AND BAPTIZE, (which is all that Chri&s;t's commi&s;&s;ion empowers ANY MAN to do) but that it requires a higher order to admini&s;ter the Lord's Supper; and a higher order &s;till to admini&s;ter the holy rite of confirmation;&mdash;may go on, and believe all the claims and pre|tences of Saint Peter's &s;ucce&s;&s;or.</NOTE>&mdash;That chri&s;tians, when they come together to eat the Lord's &s;upper, &s;hould con&s;ider it as the mo&s;t &s;olemn act of wor&s;hip; &mdash;That they &s;hould, by the eye of faith, di&s;cern the Lord's body;&mdash;That they &s;hould call to mind his death and &s;uffering, and that &s;in was the cau&s;e of them;&mdash; That they &s;hould examine them&s;elves, and look well to the motives and views which govern them&mdash;are facts which none can doubt who read the new Te&s;tament: &mdash;But that they cannot eat that &s;upper unle&s;s they have a prie&s;t to con&s;ecrate the elements and make them holy&punc; and then <HI>admini&s;ter</HI> them,&mdash;is a whim, which has no foundation in that book,&mdash;as is all pretence to lord|&s;hip and eccle&s;ia&s;tical government, derived from the commi&s;&s;ion Chri&s;t gave his apo&s;tles.</P>
<P>But, you will &s;ay; does not the apo&s;tle tell the <HI>He|brews; to remember them that had the rule over them, &mdash;to obey them that had the rule over them, and and &s;ubmit them&s;elves; and to &s;alute them that had the rule over them?</HI>&mdash;And does our Lord tell Peter that he would give him the <HI>keys</HI> of the kingdom of Heaven? And does not all this imply that Chri&s;t has given his mini&s;ters <HI>power</HI> over men? By no means. For as we
<PB N="18" REF="030992_0017_0FEA1E6B51509E00">
have already ob&s;erved; <HI>that age</HI> was the age of mira|cles and in&s;piration, and the Holy Gho&s;t did then im|part extraordinary gifts and powers, which &s;oon after cea&s;ed&mdash;and the&s;e <HI>rulers,</HI> whatever they were, might be immediately con&s;tituted &s;uch by the Holy Gho&s;t, like the <HI>over&s;eers</HI> of Ephe&s;us&mdash;Or they might be con|&s;tituted rulers by the free choice of the people. But <HI>however</HI> they <HI>might</HI> become rulers over the Hebrews; &mdash;what they &s;pake being called the word of God, im|plies that they had <HI>in&s;piration.</HI></P>
<P>And as to Peter's having the keys, it means no more than that he &s;hould unlock the door, and &s;et open the gate of the kingdom of Heaven, or the go&s;pel church. Which he did, by being the fir&s;t preacher of the go&s;|pel both to Jews and Gentiles. And as his name &s;ig|nifies a rock;&mdash;and as he was the fir&s;t preacher and founder of chri&s;tianity, it might be &s;aid, by a figure, that the church was built on him. But having <HI>opened</HI> the door, he had nothing further to do with the keys. And we do not find he <HI>attempted</HI> to make any other u&s;e of them.</P>
<P>Upon the whole it appears, that in this bu&s;ine&s;s of church government, we have been as much hoodwink|ed, as ever we were in the bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;tate govern|ment.</P>
<P>It appears al&s;o, that as the chri&s;tian religion is of infinite importance to mankind; &s;o it is al&s;o plain, &s;im|ple and rational, &mdash;every way adapted to the circum|&s;tances and nece&s;&s;ities of men; calculated, in the high|e&s;t degree to promote the peace and happine&s;s of &s;o|ciety&mdash;and in&s;tead of infringing, was intended in|deed to &s;ecure and e&s;tabli&s;h the inherent Rights, and native equality of all the children of Adam!</P>
<P>To conclude then; &mdash;All the u&s;e I wi&s;h you to make of this di&s;cour&s;e is, to be hereby excited to open your eyes, and then open your Bibles, and &s;ee for your&s;elves. The Bible has been too often repre&s;ented as a very <HI>gloomy</HI> &s;ort of a book; fit only to amu&s;e a <HI>melancholy</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="030992_0018_0FEA1E7060523B20">
hour. It has been repre&s;ented as full of mi&s;tery and ob&s;curity, and requiring a great deal of learning and &s;tudy to under&s;tand it, but it requires no great &s;tudy to under&s;tand whence this notion is derived!&mdash; We are often told what a ble&s;&s;ing it is to have the Bi|ble in our hands, and in our mother tongue. We are often pitying the poor Roman Catholics, who are, by their &s;piritual rulers, denied the u&s;e of it. <HI>We</HI> are highly favored indeed! But pray tell me what is the difference between having no Bible at all, and only having it &s;moakdrying on a &s;helf, while we depend wholy on a prie&s;t to tell us what it contains, or how we &s;hall under&s;tand it. Does not the Bible contain that very go&s;pel, and the whole of it, which Chri&s;t &s;ent his apo&s;tles to preach, and are we not threatened with damnation if we refu&s;e to believe it? Were not the apo&s;tles in&s;pired for that purpo&s;e; to guide them into all truth, and bring to their remembrance what|&s;oever Chri&s;t had taught! And have they not recorded that truth? And does it not concern us to look into it? Let me a&s;&s;ure you my friends; <HI>it is not that gloomy book!</HI> I have read a few books in my day, &amp; &s;ome with great ea|gerne&s;s and &s;atisfaction; but never one, except the Bible, but in a little time grew <HI>&s;tale,</HI> I lo&s;t my reli&s;h for it, and laid it a&s;ide. But the Bible is always new. The more I read it the better I love it. The more I am acquainted with it, the more entertainment and &s;a|tisfaction I find in it: and it &s;eems as if that would be the ca&s;e to all eternity! And this very circum&s;tance clearly evinces, that the Bible is of a different origin from all other books. And 'tis a mark of its divinity, that its contents are &s;o long unfolding. Oh! My friends! Could we read this book with that attention, candor and impartiality, which the nature of it de|mands! Could we lay a&s;ide all bigotry, &s;uper&s;tition, and party &s;pirit. Could we &s;trip chri&s;tianity of the fooleries and fopperies&mdash;Could we unload it of the lumber, which ignorance and prie&s;t-craft have
<PB N="20" REF="030992_0019_0FEA1E7329DED770">
heaped upon it, we &s;hould be charmed with it&mdash; We &s;hould embrace it with eagerne&s;s&mdash;Conform to it with cheerfulne&s;s&mdash; obey its precepts with &s;incerity, and &s;hould then have the witne&s;s in our&s;elves, and feel the genuine influence of it on our hearts, and the pow|er of it would appear in our lives! 'Twould rai&s;e us above the world! 'Twould carry as fearle&s;s thro' the valey of the &s;hadow of death, and bring us to the re|gions of eternal bli&s;s and glory! And by the&s;e means would the end of our Saviour's coming into the world be accompli&s;hed.</P>
