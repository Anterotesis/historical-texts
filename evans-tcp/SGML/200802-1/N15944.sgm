<HEAD>REMARKS ON THE PROPOSED PLAN OF AN EMISSION OF PAPER.</HEAD>
<P>HOW long a con&s;titution, under which we enjoy equal rights, may endure, it is not for &s;hort-&s;ighted mortals to predict. In the annals of the world there are few in&s;tances, where a direct attack has been made by any part of the citizens of a free &s;tate, again&s;t the liberty of the re&s;t. It has ever been the practice of tho&s;e, who meditated its de&s;truction, to avert &s;u&s;picion from them&s;elves, by warning the people of danger from others. Thus it is that a people are &s;ometimes precipi|tated into that &s;tate of anarchy and confu&s;ion, which is mo&s;t favourable to in&s;idious de&s;igns.</P>
<P>Although the frequent pro&s;titution of profe&s;&s;ions renders it almo&s;t di&s;graceful to u&s;e them, I mu&s;t a&s;&s;ure you, that from the moment I began &s;eriou&s;ly to reflect, your happine&s;s has been dear to my heart. At the hazard of my peace and for|tune, without the lea&s;t hope of reward, and with the certain pro&s;pect of provoking the malice of weak and wicked minds, I have for many years devoted my attention to the public con|cerns. On this head however I &s;hould have maintained a becoming &s;ilence, had not certain ungenerous remarks been thrown out in a place where it was impo&s;&s;ible for me, in a pro|per manner, to expo&s;e them. Be&s;ides the&s;e there is a recent publication, in which my real name has been u&s;ed with an unwarrantable freedom; but this I con&s;ider as the effu&s;ion of habitual in&s;olence, not meriting a more particular notice. A &s;ufficient an&s;wer may be collected from the following remarks.</P>
<P>When a di&s;agreement takes place between the two branches of the legi&s;lature, on a que&s;tion involving with it other que&s;|tions of &s;till greater moment, every freeman in the communi|ty is concerned in its deci&s;ion. The freedom of the pre&s;s has been indirectly attacked by men who &s;hould guard it with the
<PB N="4" REF="020403_0003_0FAF021F6A000F58">
fonde&s;t care. It has been repeatedly a&s;&s;erted, that the officers of government have exerted their influence, acquired through public money, in oppo&s;ing the wi&s;hes of the people, and that therefore they have merited puni&s;hment from the repre&s;entatives of the people. An a&s;&s;ertion repeatedly made is generally the re&s;ult of reflection. The purpo&s;e of this is to wound the feel|ings of &s;ome, re&s;train others by their fears, and bind the re&s;t by their intere&s;ts. The &s;pirit of a genuine republican mu&s;t revolt at the idea. What? Shall he, who in &s;ome re&s;pects, is con&s;tituted the guardian of your rights, be him&s;elf debarred the common right of &s;peaking his opinions? Does his &s;ituation &s;eparate his intere&s;ts from tho&s;e of the people, or render him le&s;s capable than the mo&s;t illiterate demagogue of deciding on que&s;tions of policy?</P>
<P>Thus far is premi&s;ed to remove unrea&s;onable prejudice. The author has been charged with adhering to the &s;enate, courting their favour, and repo&s;ing a faith in their deci&s;ions. The truth is, on the mature&s;t deliberation, he thinks them ju&s;tifiable in rejecting the bill for an emi&s;&s;ion of paper, and it is partly his intention to adduce &s;ome arguments in their vindication.</P>
<P>When a man coolly and deliberately acts again&s;t his intere&s;t, there is a pre&s;umption, that he conceives him&s;elf in the right. It cannot e&s;cape your penetration, that if a &s;ervant of the peo|ple were capable of &s;acrificing on the altar of ambition his opinion, his con&s;cience and his duty, he would, with every appearance of the mo&s;t fervent zeal, e&s;pou&s;e the cau&s;e of tho&s;e who might mo&s;t effectually requite his endeavours.</P>
<P>The &s;enate having rejected the propo&s;ed plan of an emi&s;&s;ion upon loan, the hou&s;e of delegates declines all overtures of a conference, and determines to clo&s;e the &s;e&s;&s;ion without making any provi&s;ion for the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies. In an addre&s;s to the people they &s;tate the di&s;agreement, and urge many arguments in &s;upport of their own &s;y&s;tem. They tell them an appeal is made by both branches of the legi&s;lature, that the opinion of the people only can decide, and that both branches will be equally bound by in&s;tructions. The &s;enate makes no direct addre&s;s; but as they conceive their fellow-citizens entitled to know the principles of their conduct, the me&s;&s;ages re&s;pecting the money bill are publi&s;hed by their direction. In one of the&s;e is a declaration, that they make no appeal; and they &s;ug|ge&s;t the inconveniencies which they apprehend may flow from the precedent. The hou&s;e of delegates adjourns to the 20th of March, and the &s;enate to the 20th of April.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="020403_0004_0FAF022017296D98">This brief narrative &s;ugge&s;ts a variety of points, a thorough di&s;cu&s;&s;ion whereof is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, before you can pru|dently take any &s;tep on this peculiar great occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place it is proper to decide, whether an appeal is made by both branches, and your in&s;tructions reque&s;ted by each. Whatever might <HI>po&s;&s;ibly</HI> be implied from the &s;enate's fir&s;t me&s;&s;age, their &s;ub&s;equent expre&s;s declaration, publi&s;hed at the &s;ame time, mu&s;t render void that implication. This con&s;truction is conformable to a known maxim of law and com|mon &s;en&s;e&mdash;<HI>Expre&s;&s;um facit ce&s;&s;are tacitum</HI>; that is, accord|ing to a liberal tran&s;lation, <HI>po&s;itive words &s;et a&s;ide that which without them would be implied.</HI> I conceive, that nothing can be fairly con&s;trued into an appeal to the people, except an ad|dre&s;s &s;oliciting their in&s;tructions in the mo&s;t plain unequivocal terms.</P>
<P>But it is in&s;i&s;ted by a crowd of writers, that although the &s;enate make no direct application, if the people &s;hall think proper to in&s;truct, the &s;enate is con&s;titutionally bound to obey.</P>
<P>This &s;econd point mu&s;t be determined on a view of the con&s;titution and the declaration of rights. To me this point al&s;o is abundantly clear, from the &s;ingle con&s;ideration, that the con&s;titution creates two di&s;tinct branches only; and that nei|ther that nor the declaration any where intimates, that the people at large are immediately a part of the legi&s;lature. Had the re&s;pectable framers intended, that whenever a bill propo&s;ed by one is rejected by the other, the people may afterwards di|rect it to be pa&s;&s;ed into a law, they would have &s;aid &s;o in plain po&s;itive terms; but then they would have rendered of no avail the in&s;titution of the two branches. The &s;enate would have been calculated for little more than to produce delays, and to afford occa&s;ions for inflaming the pa&s;&s;ions, and di&s;turbing the public quiet. There would not have been two di&s;tinct regu|lar branches to decide, but two di&s;tinct branches to propo&s;e. A bill propo&s;ed by either would be a law, not being di&s;&s;ented to by the other, or, in ca&s;e of a di&s;&s;ent, the people would con|&s;titute a third or a &s;ingle branch occa&s;ionally. No bu&s;ine&s;s would be &s;ettled in the appointed legi&s;lature, unle&s;s the two branches agreed. Had the framers entertained &s;uch ideas, they would unque&s;tionably have pre&s;cribed the manner of collecting the peoples deci&s;ion.</P>
<P>I believe there never exi&s;ted a government, in which, not|with&s;tanding every freeman had a &s;uffrage in framing laws, the que&s;tion was decided by a majority of &s;ingle voices. In the pure&s;t democracies, the people have voted by cla&s;&s;es, tribes or
<PB N="6" REF="020403_0005_0FAF0220D0220CF8">
companies, into which they were di&s;tributed, agreeably to &s;ome rational principle. I pretend to no great hi&s;torical re|&s;earches. I conceive that many ages have elap&s;ed &s;ince any civilized nation, &s;tate, or even &s;ingle independent city, has placed the power of legi&s;lation in the people at large; and I think, that no virtuous citizen, who is acquainted with the hi&s;tory of ancient democracies, would wi&s;h this power among&s;t us to re&s;ide <HI>con&s;tantly</HI> in the people. In ab&s;tract theory, &s;uch a legi&s;lation appears con&s;onant to their natural rights; but the &s;hocking inconveniencies attendant on the mode, have long &s;ince occa&s;ioned mankind to renounce it. It was calcu|lated only for &s;mall cities in their beginnings; and he that wi&s;hes for it in a &s;tate of equal extent and population to ours, mu&s;t either be a political madman, or, under the convenient cloak of public good, he veils the mo&s;t dark and traitorous intent.</P>
<P>Let us examine the true import of the fourth article of the declaration of rights; for on that article, if on any, is founded the doctrine that both branches of the legi&s;lature are bound to obey the in&s;tructions of the people, and that by &s;o doing, they act agreeably to the con&s;titution. The article &s;peaks &s;o plain a language it will be difficult for any expo&s;ition to render it more intelligible:</P>
<P><Q>That all per&s;ons inve&s;ted with the legi&s;lative or executive powers of government are the tru&s;tees of the public, and as &s;uch accountable for their conduct; wherefore, whenever the ends of government are perverted, and public liberty mani|fe&s;tly endangered, and all other means of redre&s;s are ineffec|tual, the people may, and of right ought, to reform the old or e&s;tabli&s;h a new government; the doctrine of non-re&s;i&s;t|ance again&s;t arbitrary power and oppre&s;&s;ion, is ab&s;urd, &s;la|vi&s;h, and de&s;tructive of the good and happine&s;s of mankind.</Q></P>
<P>If the period has actually arrived, when it is nece&s;&s;ary for the people to interpo&s;e, they &s;hould act in a way very different from that of commanding the &s;enate's a&s;&s;ent to a bill, which, on the mature&s;t deliberation, they have unanimou&s;ly rejected. Such an interference of the people might only prevent, for a &s;ea&s;on, that, which without many &s;ub&s;equent interferences, would be likely to take place; and the danger threatened from the corruption of their tru&s;tees would probably continually in|crea&s;e. The truth is, that from the obvious meaning of the fourth article, and upon every &s;ound principle of government, the interference of the people is a re&s;umption of all delegated powers; the whole frame is <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> di&s;&s;olved; and it becomes
<PB N="7" REF="020403_0006_0FAF0221A40DD008">
their bu&s;ine&s;s either to reform its errors and abu&s;es, and to de|clare it again in force, or to adopt an entire new &s;y&s;tem. If experience hath evinced two di&s;tinct legi&s;lative branches to be inconvenient, they will probably aboli&s;h that which is not of their immediate appointment. But to &s;ay, that the &s;enate &s;hall &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t, and enjoy their powers and privileges uninterrupted, and that notwith&s;tanding they &s;hall be obliged to give their a&s;&s;ent, which, after a full interchange of &s;entiment with the delegates, they have unanimou&s;ly declined, &s;eems uttering ma|nife&s;t contradictions to be &s;aying, that a thing is &s;o, and is not &s;o, in the &s;ame &s;entence.</P>
<P>This fourth article was unnece&s;&s;ary, as indeed are many others. It affords a &s;triking le&s;&s;on to legi&s;lators never to u&s;e &s;entences or words without nece&s;&s;ity or meaning. It was ne|ver &s;urely fore&s;een, that an article a&s;&s;erting only a natural right, could by any po&s;&s;ibility be con&s;trued into a po&s;itive in&s;titution. I have on many occa&s;ions lamented, that the convention in compo&s;ing a declaration did not content them&s;elves with re|cogni&s;ing generally the law, and laying down certain maxims of government for the conduct of future legi&s;latures. In&s;tead of that they have thrown together natural rights, principles of government, and particular provi&s;ions of the common law. Had this and the fir&s;t article been omitted, there would have been no &s;entence or word in the whole declaration or the form of government, countenancing the doctrine in que&s;tion; and yet the rights of the people would have been preci&s;ely as they are. With re&s;pect to the fifth article, which &s;peaks of the people's right to participate in the legi&s;lature, that article is manife&s;tly oppo&s;ed to the doctrine; becau&s;e it explains the right into a right of immediate repre&s;entation, and frequent elections.</P>
<P>When the happine&s;s of the people, the true end of all &s;oci|ety and government, cannot be pre&s;erved on account of &s;ome original fault in the con&s;titution, or when the tru&s;tees betray their &s;acred charge, and the people are rou&s;ed by a &s;en&s;e of in|juries no longer to be borne, the indelible rights of nature authori&s;e them to enforce that redre&s;s to which all con&s;titution|al means are incom<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">nt. This is the principle of the Eng|li&s;h revolution in 1008. This is the principle of the revo|lution in America, which every good man &s;till flatters him&s;elf will be deemed the mo&s;t important era in the hi&s;tory of the world. It would be &s;lavi&s;h to imagine, that without the fir&s;t and fourth articles, or even with one directly repugnant, the people might not annul a compact intended for their good,
<PB N="8" REF="020403_0007_0FAF02228FC1E3C8">
when experience evinces the framers of that compact to have been mi&s;taken; or that a mode of government which &s;uited its framers, might not be changed by their po&s;terity.</P>
<P>But whether a right be inherent in the people, and whether this be a proper occa&s;ion for u&s;ing it, are two di&s;tinct que&s;tions. Has ten years experience demon&s;trated the &s;enate to be either a dangerous or u&s;ele&s;s body? Has the rejection of the paper &s;y&s;tem perverted the ends of its appointment, or expo&s;ed your liberties to danger? The warme&s;t advocates for the mea&s;ure &s;urely will not maintain the affirmative of the&s;e que&s;tions to be a &s;elf-evident po&s;ition. Let them remember, that the attempt to introduce <HI>this very &s;cheme</HI> mi&s;carried two years &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, and yet the people murmured not. In the third year the hou&s;e of delegates were induced to adopt it. The &s;enate unani|mou&s;ly di&s;&s;ented. The people &s;till made no complaints. In|deed, had the conduct of the &s;enate excited their di&s;plea&s;ure, it might have been ea&s;ily manife&s;ted in the late election. In this election the gentlemen mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed for oppo&s;ition to paper, were honoured with almo&s;t every &s;uffrage. It will be &s;trange indeed, if you can now be per&s;uaded, that the new &s;enate has perverted the ends of government by declining an expedient rejected by the old, and by two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive hou&s;es of delegates.</P>
<P>The mode of appointing your &s;enate is e&s;teemed by wi&s;e men the mo&s;t admirable in&s;titution in all the United States&punc; and I make no doubt, that in Europe it has done honour to American genius. The &s;enate of Maryland has been conti|nually acquiring the e&s;teem and confidence of the people, whil&s;t other &s;enates have fallen in repute. The difference ari&s;es from the different modes of election. It is not a man's popularity in a &s;ingle county or di&s;trict, it is his general good character, and his real dignity and importance, that confer on him this honour. The &s;uffrage of the electors is a tribute paid to worth. The arts of intrigue, and even the magic powers of eloquence, &s;hould the&s;e be e&s;&s;ayed, will probably be found unavailing.</P>
<P>In &s;pite of the&s;e circum&s;tances attempts are made to excite your &s;u&s;picions of the &s;enate. You are told, that in this &s;elect body prevails a baneful ari&s;tocratic &s;pirit. Enemy as I am to arbitrary &s;way <HI>of every kind,</HI> I was at fir&s;t &s;tartled at the &s;ug|ge&s;tion. But as this was a weighty charge, I thought &s;ome proof &s;hould be required &s;uperior to the bare a&s;&s;ertion of any man. An ari&s;tocracy is properly when <HI>the &s;overeign power of a &s;tate re&s;ides in a permanent body of men di&s;tinct from the peo|ple.</HI> At pre&s;ent the &s;enate is not that permanent body; be|cau&s;e
<PB N="9" REF="020403_0008_0FAF02232A778178">
it is appointed once in five years, and the &s;upreme power re&s;ides not in it to &s;o great an extent as in the hou&s;e of dele|gates. Neither of them alone can pa&s;s a law. If an ari&s;tocracy be the government of a few, <HI>uncontroled and unchecked by any other power,</HI> an ari&s;tocratic &s;pirit mu&s;t mean a di&s;po&s;ition to bring about &s;uch a government. In what in&s;tance has even a &s;ingle &s;enator evinced an inclination to confine the powers of legi&s;lation to the &s;enate, or to change that branch into a per|manent hereditary body. I now a&s;k, whether the addre&s;s of your delegates be not an attempt to have their own propo&s;ition pa&s;&s;ed into a law, without the con&s;ent of the &s;enate. I be|&s;eech you to reflect &s;oberly, whether this conduct of the dele|gates does not tend indirectly to confer on them alone the power of making laws.</P>
<P>I am thoroughly, and upon the be&s;t grounds, per&s;uaded, that no man in the &s;enate conceives him&s;elf at liberty to di&s;regard the wants, wi&s;hes, or &s;entiments of the people. He is per|fectly apprized, that the in&s;titution was not intended to cloathe individuals with honour merely for their own gratification; but, like every other part of the con&s;titution, to con&s;ult the general good. There may be a variety of in&s;tances where this general good is promoted by gratifying the inclination of the people. But is there a man &s;o lo&s;t to common &s;en&s;e as not to fore&s;ee, that if the people &s;hall take upon them&s;elves to decide nice que&s;tions of policy by a majority of voices, they may frequently be wrought upon to choo&s;e things which will injure them the mo&s;t. I repeat that their will, provided they per&s;i&s;t long enough to pur&s;ue effectual mea&s;ures, mu&s;t &s;tand for a law. But on what ground can a man who breathes the true &s;pirit of patrioti&s;m, per&s;uade them to exerci&s;e their will on the pre|&s;ent occa&s;ion? Can he &s;eriou&s;ly believe them better qualified than the &s;enate to decide on the expediency of an emi&s;&s;ion? It is not &s;ufficient to &s;ay, they be&s;t know their own wants; be|cau&s;e that is only a begging of the que&s;tion, which is, whe|ther an emi&s;&s;ion would &s;upply tho&s;e wants. Behold the glar|ing mon&s;trous ab&s;urdity. The people do not immediately choo&s;e the &s;enate. They appoint their mo&s;t intelligent men to choo&s;e for them; and their electors make the mo&s;t diligent inquiry into every corner of the &s;tate. Well, the &s;enate, after all, is ignorant of the true intere&s;ts of the &s;tate; and the ge|neral body of the people, from which they were &s;elected, is to &s;upply their wants, and enlighten their under&s;tandings.</P>
<P>If any man &s;ays the &s;enate are intere&s;ted, or otherwi&s;e cor|rupt, let us have an opportunity to decide on his te&s;timony; for
<PB N="10" REF="020403_0009_0FAF0223DFE97EA0">
confident a&s;&s;ertions, and noi&s;y declamation, will, I tru&s;t, at la&s;t, &s;tand for nought.</P>
<P>It may be &s;aid the compari&s;on is not proper between the people and the &s;enate; that the people are called to decide be|tween their immediate repre&s;entatives and the &s;enate, on a que&s;tion, the right deci&s;ion of which is e&s;&s;ential to your hap|pine&s;s; and that, until this deci&s;ion, all operations of the legi&s;|lature will be &s;u&s;pended. In the &s;ame way might any other rejected bill be brought before the people. It is indeed natu|ral for every projector to e&s;teem his own <HI>&s;y&s;tem</HI> of the la&s;t im|portance. In a conte&s;t between the two branches, to be de|termined in the propo&s;ed manner, is it at all probable, that the que&s;tion will come fairly before the people? The number of delegates exceeds that of the &s;enate in a ratio of five for one. This circum&s;tance could not fail to operate, if even the arts of popularity were laid a&s;ide, the inhabitants of each county a&s;&s;embled, the merits fairly di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, and in&s;tructions &s;igned only at that, or a &s;ub&s;equent meeting of the &s;ame kind. The delegates being far more intimately connected with their con|&s;tituents, it mu&s;t be a plain que&s;tion indeed, which the people will decide in favour of the &s;enate. Would to Heaven my countrymen could &s;ee the bu&s;ine&s;s in a true light. Their re|pre&s;entatives appeal to them for in&s;tructions&mdash;So far I &s;hould have no objection, if their repre&s;entatives were them&s;elves un|determined. But the&s;e in&s;tructions are to govern the &s;enate, and at the &s;ame time to be dictated by the delegates. In this kind of &s;ervice the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">My readers will under&s;tand, that whenever I &s;peak of the people, I mean a majority of the great body of our citizens.</NOTE> people are not volunteers, and they feel not enough to &s;timulate them to a voluntary exertion. Can the interpo&s;ition of the people thus obtained, be termed an interference, dictated by a &s;en&s;e of wrongs, a defence of na|tural rights, and a promotion of the true ends of government? Can a man wi&s;h the free unbia&s;&s;ed &s;entiments of the people to prevail, when he exerts every nerve to obtain their deci&s;ion before each &s;ide of the que&s;tion can be fairly examined? A draught of in&s;tructions is circulated before the clo&s;e of the &s;e&s;&s;ion. Its preamble a&s;&s;erts the appeal of the &s;enate, and the people are pre&s;&s;ed to &s;ub&s;cribe before they can po&s;&s;ibly examine the allegation, or hear the &s;enate's rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>Is this &s;uch a mode as naturally &s;ugge&s;ted it&s;elf to men anxi|ous in the pur&s;uit of truth? Were the&s;e in&s;tructions in other re&s;pects con&s;titutional, they would be void on one certain
<PB N="11" REF="020403_0010_0FAF0224A13EF4B0">
ground. Had the &s;enate, being at a lo&s;s how to decide, really appealed to the people, in&s;tructions would be &s;trictly proper; but the per&s;onal influence of any member or either branch, would even in that ca&s;e have been extremely improper.</P>
<P>Were I an advocate for the principle, I &s;hould be puzzled re&s;pecting the true manner of communicating the &s;en&s;e of the people. Are in&s;tructions to be &s;igned only at public meet|ings? Is there to be one meeting only? Is that meeting to take place at each county court-hou&s;e, or in each hundred? Is one general form to be pur&s;ued? Or may each man choo&s;e his own form? By whom are the &s;everal papers to be collected in each county or di&s;trict? With whom &s;hall they all be lodged? What &s;hall be deemed a &s;ufficient authentication? On a &s;ug|ge&s;tion of forgery, how &s;hall the fact be a&s;certained, or the crime puni&s;hed? A thou&s;and &s;uch que&s;tions may be a&s;ked, and the ingenuity of many gentlemen might be &s;ufficient to pre|&s;cribe &s;uitable provi&s;ions. But as to the&s;e que&s;tions no an&s;wer is found in the con&s;titution, the conclu&s;ion is obvious, that its framers had no idea of the thing, con&s;i&s;tent with the regu|lar admini&s;tration of the government by <HI>them</HI> devi&s;ed. I re|peat, that whenever the great body of the people &s;hall declare their will (in whatever way it be done) this declaration, agree|ably to the fourth article of the declaration, and the unaliena|ble rights of nature, ought to be law; but then the whole frame of the government is either di&s;&s;olved or &s;u&s;pended. I mean not, that any act of violence committed by only a part, and ob&s;tructing the exerci&s;e of a con&s;titutional authority, would amount to this di&s;&s;olution or &s;u&s;pen&s;ion. I mean &s;uch an in|terference as is mentioned in that article. I contend that, ac|cording to the plain import of the words, the authors had not in contemplation an interference, without a total di&s;&s;olution or a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, until it could be reformed, and again declared in force.</P>
<P>Had the con&s;titution made expre&s;s provi&s;ion, and pre&s;cribed the manner in which in&s;tructions &s;hould be given, &s;o as to bind both branches of the legi&s;lature, the people ought never|thele&s;s to be extremely &s;paring in the exerci&s;e. Were the cor|rupt motives of the &s;enate apparent; if by their conduct your liberties were manife&s;tly endangered; if proving fal&s;e to their tru&s;t, they &s;acrificed the pubic good to their own private views&mdash;it would be proper to teach them their duty, and at the &s;ame time to addre&s;s them in the terms of a &s;evere repri|mand. And further, as the people are to exerci&s;e the right, the people only &s;hould determine on the occa&s;ion. I repeat
<PB N="12" REF="020403_0011_0FAF0226EEEF6568">
again and again, that with or without a con&s;titutional provi&s;i|on, the people ought unque&s;tionably to interfere on occa&s;ions like the&s;e. The difference between me and my adver&s;aries is, whether an interference will not aboli&s;h or &s;u&s;pend the con&s;ti|tutional legi&s;lature; and whether this be a proper &s;ea&s;on for an interference. The doctrines imputed to me by &s;cribblers, I dete&s;t as much as I do all in&s;olence, domineering, &s;edition, ma|lice and calumny.</P>
<P>I &s;hould imagine any prudent, cautious, di&s;intere&s;ted citi|zen, who has a valuable &s;take in the community, who&s;e wel|fare is intimately connected with the public pro&s;perity, who wi&s;hes no change in a government under which none hold &s;uperior rights, who would hazard all, and could gain nothing by a new revolution&mdash;I &s;hould imagine that &s;uch a man, let his opinion re&s;pecting an emi&s;&s;ion be what it may, will be in|duced by no &s;olicitation to &s;ub&s;cribe. The point was &s;imply, whether bills of credit &s;hould be emitted on loan. The hou&s;e of delegates was divided. A member who&s;e reputation is not limited to the&s;e &s;tates, who, &s;ometime ago, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed your al|mo&s;t unbounded confidence, and to whom nothing had &s;ince been imputed, this gentleman, with about two fifths of the hou&s;e, was &s;tedfa&s;tly oppo&s;ed to the plan. The &s;enate were unanimous. But what again is the &s;enate? It is a &s;elect body of men of enlarged minds, and unblemi&s;hed characters, hav|ing no intere&s;t whatever di&s;tinct from yours, bearing with you a full proportion of burthens, and out of the &s;enate-hou&s;e at their own homes, to all intents and purpo&s;es, compo&s;ing a part of the people. If the&s;e fifteen men can harbour a de&s;ign of erecting an arbitrary power on the ruins of the con&s;titution, of enjoying their dignities for life, and bequeathing them to their i&s;&s;ue, they have conceived ideas of which I did not think the brain of man &s;u&s;ceptible. Suppo&s;e the la&s;t convention had conferred the whole legi&s;lative authority on the &s;enate, ap|pointed fifteen men &s;enators for life, and rendered the office hereditary. Is it po&s;&s;ible &s;uch an odious e&s;tabli&s;hment could have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted even unto this day. No &s;enator under the pre|&s;ent form can meditate an exten&s;ion of his authority, and no rational being, on a moment's reflection, can retain his &s;u&s;pi|cions, unle&s;s jealou&s;y of your tru&s;tees be like the jealou&s;y of love, excited without cau&s;e, and &s;ub&s;i&s;ting on idle fancies. If a &s;enator were really capable of &s;uch de&s;igns, he would become a much fitter object of deri&s;ion, than of any well grounded apprehen&s;ion. Happy will it be for you, my countrymen, if that con&s;titution which perhaps owes its exi&s;tence, and has
<PB N="13" REF="020403_0012_0FAF02282B047768">
done honour to men, who no longer view it with a parent's eye, &s;hall with&s;tand this powerful attack. Oh! li&s;ten to a man who defies the tongue of envy and detraction to fix one improper motive for this addre&s;s, who has long been a faithful guardian to that con&s;titution, and feels for it more than a fa|ther's love. Be a&s;&s;ured, if it mu&s;t receive a deadly wound, the fatal blow will be dealt by your&s;elves, or your immediate repre&s;entatives. Far from me be the wi&s;h of narrowing the powers of the popular branch of the legi&s;lature. The defect of human policy, ari&s;ing from human nature, is &s;uch, that in in&s;tituting the frame of a government, it is impo&s;&s;ible to guard again&s;t dangers on one &s;ide, without being expo&s;ed on another. Were every thing &s;ubmitted to my di&s;cretion, I de|clare &s;olemnly I would not abridge the e&s;tabli&s;hed power of your delegates. my only wi&s;h and aim is to protect that &s;acred palladium of your rights, which you have &s;worn to defend, again&s;t all open and &s;ecret combinations. Permit not either branch, <HI>by any method,</HI> to exerci&s;e the office of both. The very u&s;e and intent of one is to check any unadvi&s;ed ha&s;ty pro|ceedings, or intemperate &s;allies of the other more numerous a&s;&s;embly. Think not, that a prediliction for the former has blinded my under&s;tanding. I further declare, that if it were left to me to aboli&s;h one or the other, I would by all means pre&s;erve the hou&s;e of delegates. There is nothing more hate|ful to my &s;oul than the idea of a proud, worthle&s;s, tyrannical order of nobility, like the &s;enate of Venice. But, although this government may hereafter po&s;&s;ibly degenerate into an ar|bitrary one, there is no rea&s;on to dread, that it will become an ari&s;tocracy erected by the &s;enate.</P>
<P>If it be the meaning of the fourth article, that the peo|ple &s;hall act as an umpire, wherefore is it, that in every in|&s;tance of a di&s;&s;ent the bill is not laid before them? To this may be &s;aid, they are called upon only with re&s;pect to bills of the la&s;t importance. The con&s;titution however creates no di&s;tinction. The con&s;titution contains no provi&s;ion in any ca&s;e.</P>
<P>An idea has been &s;tarted, that both branches are to be con|&s;idered as agents of the people, and the con&s;titution a letter of in&s;tructions; that as it was impo&s;&s;ible for the principal to fore&s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of an emi&s;&s;ion at this time, he may now give additional in&s;tructions. There is a di&s;po&s;ition in mankind to be impo&s;ed on by &s;imilitudes. They captivate the imagina|tion, and are much better received than &s;olid argument. Be|hold another &s;imilitude.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="020403_0013_0FAF02291CC26188">There are fifty per&s;ons, the far greater part having no know|ledge or experience in trade, who agree to join &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">, and commence merchants.

His judgment is not convinced, and he adheres to his opinion. Should the law authori&s;e the majority, notwith&s;tanding their agreement, to di&s;place their agents, and &s;hould they take the management into their own hands, they are again in the &s;ituation which induced them to choo&s;e managers.

<P>The meaning of this allegory is to guard you again&s;t &s;ophi&s;|try.</P>
<P>Let us trace the con&s;equences of the doctrine, that, not|with&s;tanding the expre&s;s provi&s;ions of the con&s;titution, the people, without violating or &s;u&s;pending, may control a dele|gated power. If it be good with regard to the legi&s;lature, it mu&s;t likewi&s;e be good with re&s;pect to the executive and judiciary.</P>
<P>A citizen levies con&s;tructive war again&s;t the &s;tate. He is thereon indicted in the general court, arraigned, takes his trial, and is found guilty by the unanimous &s;uffrage of twelve men, the petit jury. This man is a favourite of the people. His friends make &s;trenuous exertions, and a great majority of the people are induced to &s;ign a declaration of their will, and an order, that he be di&s;charged. There is no doubt the pri&s;oner will e&s;cape puni&s;hment, provided the people &s;hall enforce their

mandate. But will any man pretend, that, it authori&s;es the judge legally and con&s;titutionally to pronounce the di&s;charge? And yet the court may be con&s;idered the agent of the people, deriving authority like every other department of government, immediately or ultimately from the people.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e now the addre&s;s to &s;ucceed, and in ten countries a greater number to have &s;igned the in&s;tructions for an emi&s;&s;ion, than have either &s;igned again&s;t it, or declined &s;igning at all <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It &s;urely will not be maintained, that any writing can be ju&s;tly &s;tyled the declaration of a county's &s;en&s;e, unle&s;s more than one half of the voters, or of the freemen, &s;hall have &s;igned it. If it can, where &s;hall the line be drawn? Or what prevents a paper &s;igned by a dozen, when there is no counter paper, from being &s;tyled in&s;tructions?</NOTE>. The &s;enate taking the con&s;titution for their guide, and finding it no where expre&s;&s;ed, that in any ca&s;e they &s;hall be bound to pa&s;s laws again&s;t their own opinion, &s;till viewing the &s;y&s;tem as injurious to our affairs, e&s;teeming it their inviolable duty to pre&s;erve the con&s;titution unimpaired, and thinking too, that the free unbia&s;&s;ed opinion has not been obtained, will mo&s;t probably continue firm in rejecting the bill. The hou&s;e of delegates will then mo&s;t probably decline for a &s;ea&s;on all further intercour&s;e. The people then, or a part of them in behalf of the re&s;t, mi&s;taking the firmne&s;s of virtue for an ob&s;tinate con|tempt of their rights, will perhaps repair to the capital, and <HI>in thunder</HI> pronounce their will.

Immediately may en|&s;ue &s;cenes, the bare contemplation of which mu&s;t touch the &s;tuote&s;t heart, not intere&s;ted to produce them. But pa&s;&s;ing over the&s;e &s;cenes of di&s;cord, riot, violence, and perhaps blood|&s;hed, let us calmly con&s;ider what be&s;t can pos&s;&s;ibly happen. On a re&s;ignation of the &s;enate, provided &s;uch a mea&s;ure would not be con&s;trued void on the principle of dure&s;&s;e, there can be no &s;enate under the pre&s;ent form until the year 1791. In &s;uch a ca&s;e the hou&s;e of delegates may do one of two things. They may proceed, on the pretext of nece&s;&s;ity, to exerci&s;e alone the powers of legi&s;lation, or they may addre&s;s their con&s;tituents
<PB N="16" REF="020403_0015_0FAF022AAC0C7D40">
to elect a convention. The latter being more &s;afe and decent, will probably be adopted. Alas, my beloved countrymen, we &s;hall be fortunate indeed, if the convention will recogni&s;e the pre&s;ent con&s;titution, reforming only a few errors and abu&s;es, and rendering it from this convul&s;ion more &s;table than before, or if a new con&s;titution from its a&s;hes &s;hall ari&s;e &s;uperior to the pre&s;ent! The members of a convention will be compo&s;ed principally of the pre&s;ent delegates, irritated and inflamed as they are again&s;t the &s;enate.</P>
<P>You will be told, that this is an attempt, by alarming your fears, to intimidate you from doing that which is right. To him who attentively, and with a proper frame of mind, con&s;i|ders the conduct and addre&s;s of your delegates, the me&s;&s;ages of the &s;enate and the aforegoing remarks, the condition of our affairs will appear critical and alarming. If I know my own heart, although I were thoroughly convinced, that bills of cre|dit would produce the promi&s;ed effects, I would &s;tedfa&s;tly &s;et my face again&s;t this mode of effecting the plan. Nothing &s;hort of a conviction, that on the &s;cheme depended your &s;afety and happine&s;s, would reconcile me to the idea. At the &s;ame time were I certain that the people, left to them&s;elves, would feel the want of an emi&s;&s;ion, and without it could not be con|tent, I would renounce my opinion, and reprobate the man who could hold out again&s;t the free voice of the people, his ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>When I con&s;ider, that independent of impelling the people, like a blind machine, to break down the fixed barriers of the con&s;titution, the &s;cheme for an emi&s;&s;ion is pregnant with a thou&s;and ills, I regret the poor extent of my powers. I wi&s;h for immediate in&s;piration. When indeed alone, and in my &s;tudy, I contemplate on all the&s;e things, my whole frame be|comes agitated and convul&s;ed. I feel as it were the re&s;i&s;tle&s;s impul&s;e of an invi&s;ible agent.</P>
<P>I PROCEED now to offer &s;ome remarks on the nature of the plan.&mdash;After the me&s;&s;ages of the &s;enate, and another re|cent publication, it is perhaps unnece&s;&s;ary to advance any thing further on bills of credit. There are however &s;ome things which either e&s;caped that honourable body, and the ingenious Commentator on that <HI>great</HI> and <HI>good</HI> man Mr. Necker, or did not &s;trike them &s;o forcibly as they do me. The conduct of the advocates for an emi&s;&s;ion, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, affords a pre|&s;umption
<PB N="17" REF="020403_0016_0FAF022B77858FE0">
that the paper will depreciate. Not a man who &s;ub|&s;cribes in&s;tructions, at the &s;ame time obliges him&s;elf to receive it as &s;pecie. If he did, I would then remind him of the red money, founded on real public property to an amount far &s;upe|rior to the &s;um emitted, on private &s;ub&s;criptions to four times that amount, on a con&s;iderable tax payable in the bills, on the &s;olemn a&s;&s;ociation of a great part of the people, and on their authority exerci&s;ed in the appointment of committees. It came out too at a time when the extreme &s;carcity of a medium was univer&s;ally acknowledged. It is &s;uppo&s;ed, that the critical pe|riod of that emi&s;&s;ion con&s;titutes a material difference between the red money and the emi&s;&s;ion now propo&s;ed. With re&s;pect to the doubtful i&s;&s;ue of the war, you well remember, that red mo|ney funds, every particle of your property, your liberty, and perhaps your lives, depended on the &s;ame event. The red mo|ney was, be&s;ides, the only immediate re&s;ource left to this &s;tate for feeding the army.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of this money might convince you, that the &s;ea|&s;on for bills of credit is pa&s;t. There was a time, when, in all re&s;pects, they were equal to ca&s;h. But we ought rather to be &s;urpri&s;ed at the circum&s;tance, than from it to expect they will be &s;o again.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider, I be&s;eech you, the true nature of bills of credit. They are promi&s;&s;ory notes, for &s;ums of money payable at a di&s;tant day. What then &s;hall give them value equal to &s;o ma|ny &s;ums of ready money? A kind of popular illu&s;ion, an opini|on univer&s;ally, or very generally, prevailing, that they will an&s;wer all the purpo&s;es of &s;pecie, will give them this value as effectually as if there were a &s;um of money depo&s;ited in places convenient to every per&s;on for exchanging on demand. Under &s;uch an opinion, no man would he&s;itate to take them from another.</P>
<P>This opinion, having exi&s;ted before the war, was unfortu|nately lo&s;t by the continental bills. Every attempt to re&s;tore it has mi&s;carried. I will not &s;ay, that no man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a faith in bills of credit; but I remark, that a very great part of the people do not. There exi&s;ts not then this popular illu&s;ion, or opinion. It is indeed extraordinary to contend that it does, when &s;o many reprobate the very name of paper money.</P>
<P>Opinion is the &s;upport of almo&s;t every &s;pecies of legal au|thority. When the people in a county believe, that the &s;heriff has power to do every act enjoined, this belief confers the power in reality. When they want this belief, he is no more than a common man. In like manner, bills of credit not be|ing
<PB N="18" REF="020403_0017_0FAF022C0FE78C68">
from their nature ready ca&s;h, if the people do not think them &s;o, there is nothing which can make them &s;o.</P>
<P>The loude&s;t clamours for an emi&s;&s;ion afford no proof of the opinion's exi&s;tence. That clamour may be rai&s;ed, becau&s;e men conceive that an emi&s;&s;ion would dimini&s;h the tax; be|cau&s;e debtors may entertain the idea either of di&s;charging their debts with facility, or of &s;taying the importunity of their cre|ditors; becau&s;e the more paper is &s;cattered abroad, the better chance have public debtors of every kind; becau&s;e there are abundant &s;ubjects of &s;peculation, which render it profitable to borrow paper at par, and exchange it at di&s;count; becau&s;e thoughtle&s;s improvident men are ever prone to prefer pre&s;ent ea&s;e to the greate&s;t di&s;tant good.</P>
<P>The &s;ticklers for paper appeal to the recent experience of &s;i&s;ter &s;tates. A per&s;on from Philadelphia has lately a&s;&s;ured the inhabitants of this city, that in Philadelphia he generally agrees to take half ca&s;h, half paper, and contrives pretty well to get rid of the paper. The &s;tipulation of half and half de|mon&s;trates a difference, which indeed the hou&s;e of delegates di&s;covered to be ten per cent. I flatter my&s;elf I &s;hall explain why it maintains &s;o high a value, without an&s;wering the pur|po&s;e of its emi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In Penn&s;ylvania the &s;um emitted is moderate. It is receiv|able by the public in &s;o many ways, that there is a continual demand, and numerous competitors. It changes from its ori|ginal nature of promi&s;&s;ory notes, becomes an article of mer|chandi&s;e, and its value depends on principles &s;imilar to tho&s;e of merchandi&s;e in general. Attend to every circum&s;tance. It is the doctrine of &s;ome men who pretend to rea&s;on on princi|ple, that if there he a demand, or &s;everal demands, exceeding the amount of an emi&s;&s;ion, the value of the paper mu&s;t be equal to that of &s;pecie, and a dollar of the one will be no bet|ter than a dollar of the other. Here is plain proof to the con|trary, and unerring principle might have convinced them without the experiment.</P>
<P>So long as paper will not an&s;wer every purpo&s;e of &s;pecie, &s;o long will a &s;ilver dollar be worth more than a paper dollar, redeemable at a di&s;tant day. In Penn&s;ylvania, paper can pay all taxes and duties. A man owes taxes, and has nothing but &s;pecie; there is no inducement for him to exchange it, unle&s;s for &s;o doing he be allowed a premium. As, however, there are numbers in the &s;ame &s;ituation, he cannot make his own terms. Hence it is, that he is obliged to give &pound;.90 in coin for &pound;.100 in paper. At this price have the demands fixed
<PB N="19" REF="020403_0018_0FAF022E90138E08">
the paper. There is a general demand, calling for a greater &s;um than is in the hands of the people; and, be&s;ides this, there are &s;everal other demands. Superadded to this con&s;ideration, almo&s;t the whole of each demand centers in Philadelphia, and very little of the paper finds its way out of the city. Advert now to the main rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned for i&s;&s;uing paper.&mdash;It is to increa&s;e, throughout the &s;tate, the circulating medium. No man in Philadelphia pretends to a&s;&s;ert, that the circulating me|dium is at all increa&s;ed by the emi&s;&s;ion of the bills of credit, or promi&s;&s;ory notes. The paper only con&s;titutes an additional article of merchandi&s;e, which indeed is &s;ometimes bartered for other commodities. Shopkeepers adverti&s;e, they will take paper as &s;pecie for their commodities. This they may well do, for the &s;ake of a more rapid &s;ale, and from having imperceptibly rai&s;ed their prices. They know the amount of the emi&s;&s;ion, of the ta<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">s, and of the duties; and the demand created by the u&s;es, cannot fail to enable them to di&s;po&s;e of their paper at a di&s;count, for which their amends a<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">ple.</P>
<P>Now for the operation and effect.&mdash;The people can pay any given tax with greater facility; but then this tax being &s;o much the le&s;s productive, there is a nece&s;&s;ity for &s;upplying the defect by additional taxes.

<P>I have that &s;kill in paper (and I pretend to no more than is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by a thou&s;and others) that, let we know the amount, funds, period of redemption, u&s;es and demands, and, from &s;ure principles, I can calculate pretty nearly the value at which it will be at different &s;tages. If the &s;um, not very large, be redeemable within ten years, without having created u&s;es and demands, I then calculate the value of a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of hand, paya|ble at the end of ten years, without intere&s;t. Suppo&s;e the u&s;e of money for one year to be worth twelve per cent. <HI>and no doubts entertained of the redemption,</HI> &pound;.100 will be then worth about &pound;.45.</P>
<P>If there be any immediate u&s;es, the value then depends on them. The period of redemption, and the funds, are out of the que&s;tion. They become &s;trictly an article of merchandi&s;e. Are matters on &s;uch a footing, that the holders of the paper &s;hall &s;eek purcha&s;ers, or tho&s;e wanting paper &s;hall &s;eek &s;ellers? On this que&s;tion much depends. In Philadelphia the holders adverti&s;e, and the u&s;es immediately bring them purcha&s;ers.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="020403_0019_0FAF022FA6D34908">Let us examine the plan of our delegates.&mdash;&pound;.250,000 to be emitted on loan, and, as I apprehend, &pound; 100,000 to be laid out in purcha&s;es of one kind or another.</P>
<P>I take it as a &s;ettled point, I rea&s;on not with the man who denies it, that, in this &s;tate <HI>at lea&s;t,</HI> opinion does not place paper on a footing with &s;pecie. The values at which the emi&s;&s;ions of 1780 have been held &s;ince the peace are notori|ous, and yet many times the amount are receivable by the trea&s;urer as &s;pecie. The value of the projected paper mu&s;t depend on the funds, and a confidence that it will be redeemed, or on immediate u&s;es. I have fully explained the fir&s;t princi|ple. There remains &s;omething to be &s;aid on the &s;econd. It is not &s;ufficient that a demand call for the whole of an article&mdash; the demand mu&s;t be general. If one per&s;on only wants the article, and the quantity he wants exceeds the whole quantity in the &s;tate, which is in the hands of one hundred per&s;ons, it is evident that he has them at his mercy. If only one per&s;on has an article, wanted by one hundred, the quantity, provided it be not very great, is not of much moment. He has them at his mercy, until they are fully &s;upplied, and then his com|modity becomes a drug. But if there be many buyers and many &s;ellers, and the former have more than is wanted by the latter, it is a drug in the beginning.</P>
<P>For the propo&s;ed paper of Maryland there is propo&s;ed only one general demand, and that is to be created by taxes of the pre&s;ent year. Suppo&s;e their amount &pound;.150,000, (which by the bye is much greater than can or ought to be laid) this de|mand will not place the holders of paper in the eligible &s;itua|tion of being &s;ought by the purcha&s;ers. The demand owing to duties is &s;mall, and confined to the men be&s;t acquainted with the my&s;tery of buying and &s;elling. Arrears of taxes in|deed, amount pretty high; but a great part is due from col|lectors, and the re&s;idue is by no means apportioned among&s;t the people. It is chiefly due by men of large unproductive e&s;tates. With re&s;pect to arrearages, if paper be equal to &s;pe|cie, they will remain due after an emi&s;&s;ion, except only from tho&s;e who &s;hall borrow. The&s;e, from the nature of the plan, mu&s;t be few. In &s;hort, the arrears will con&s;titute only a par|ticular demand, and this will be very &s;mall, until a depreciation &s;hall en&s;ue.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, therefore, I do not &s;ay, that I <HI>apprehend</HI> a very con&s;iderable appreciation. I a&s;&s;ert po&s;itively, that the pa|per, in the cour&s;e of &s;ix months after an emi&s;&s;ion, would depre|ciate more than thirty-three and one third per cent. and, were

<P>It was reported during the &s;e&s;&s;ion, that the paper at New-York was even by brokers exchanged at two and a half. That brokers could make an advantage demon&s;trates, that &s;u&s;picions were entertained, or, in a place abounding with ca&s;h, there could be no nece&s;&s;ity for applying to <HI>them.</HI> I have heard the following account of that emi&s;&s;ion: That parties having run high, there was a kind of compromi&s;e. In con&s;ideration of the emi&s;&s;ion's not exceeding a certain &s;um, the enemies of the &s;cheme agreed to give it &s;upport; and attempts to depreciate it were deemed infamous. The premium to brokers was deemed allowable, as a rea&s;onable &s;atisfaction for their trouble. I again go back to the hi&s;tory of red money. For a &s;hort &s;ea&s;on that al&s;o was even here <HI>&s;aid</HI> to pa&s;s as &s;pecie; that is, in the few payments and purcha&s;es made with it in the begin|ning, there was no actual di&s;count. But, &s;o &s;oon as without infamy a man might di&s;tingui&s;h, you may remember how ra|pid the depreciation. Attend to that emi&s;&s;ion on another ac|count.&mdash;It was made receivable at par for all taxes. Wheat and tobacco was al&s;o receivable, the former at &s;even and &s;ix|pence, when the actual value was about five &s;hillings. This mea&s;ure &s;oon fixed the value of red money at two for one, when, according to the afore&s;aid principle of the paper advo|cates, a dollar of it ought to have been worth five &s;hillings. If men will not li&s;ten to experience, nor determine upon plain evident principles, it is an error to call them rational animals. With re&s;pect however to the emi&s;&s;ion of New-York, the ex|periment is not complete. We know not its exact circum|&s;tances. Too little time has elap&s;ed, to have the value a&s;cer|tained as at Philadelphia, on certain &s;olid grounds. I am well a&s;&s;ured, that at the la&s;t place the idea of bills of credit &s;erving for a circulating medium, or an&s;wering any valuable purpo&s;es, is relinqui&s;hed by its warme&s;t friends.

Do they mean, that if the property and labour &s;old annually in the &s;tate, be worth 1,000,000 of money, that there ought to be that million in the &s;tate? If they mean the la&s;t, they are certainly mi&s;ta|ken; becau&s;e the &s;ame &s;um, in the cour&s;e of a year, may per|form a great variety of offices.</P>
<P>Were the &s;tate of Maryland &s;eparated from, and inacce&s;&s;ible to, the re&s;t of the world,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e two quantities are worth about &pound;. <HI>180,000</HI> current money.</NOTE> 1,000lb. of gold, and 20,000lb. of &s;ilver, would <HI>repre&s;ent</HI> the property and labour bought and &s;old, and bear a proportion to the enumerated articles, as fully as if the&s;e quantities were trebled, &s;o as to produce nearly that quantity of money which the delegates think nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;tate, connected with, and acce&s;&s;ible as it is, to the inhabitants of other countries. If in the &s;uppo&s;ed &s;eparation, the pre&s;ence of 1,000lb. of gold, and 20,000lb. of &s;ilver, would cau&s;e a bu&s;hel of wheat to be &s;old for two &s;hillings and &s;ix-pence, or about 6 dwt. of &s;ilver, the augmentation of them to thrice the quan|tity would, in the end, occa&s;ion a bu&s;hel of wheat to be &s;old for &s;even &s;hillings and &s;ix-pence, or about 18dwt. of &s;ilver, provided there were no change in the quantity or demand. So that the quantity of &s;pecie would not be material.</P>
<P>But as Maryland is connected with, and acce&s;&s;ible to, the inhabitants of other countries, there <HI>will,</HI> without the intro|duction of paper, be always as much money as will do the offices mentioned in the addre&s;s.

quantity of ca&s;h, by degrees, rai&s;ing the prices of her com|modities, it no longer &s;uits her merchants to &s;end the&s;e com|modities to other countries for the purpo&s;e of importing for them other commodities. They then remit coin. The &s;ur|plus commodities now lying on hand, and the quantity of ca&s;h being le&s;&s;ened by the&s;e remittances, they again fall to that price which will enable merchants to export them on better terms than &s;pecie. Again the hard metals flow into the country; and again their reflux is infallibly brought about.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is a complicated &s;ubject, and requires fuller explana|tion. Confu&s;ed writers have perplexed them&s;elves, and rendered it unintelligible to their readers. My po&s;ition is not that prices are <HI>con&s;tantly</HI> proportioned to the quantity of circulating coin, and that a &s;udden influx of coin would <HI>in&s;tantly</HI> rai&s;e prices, or a &s;udden export occa&s;ion an <HI>immediate</HI> fall. I mean, that a con|&s;iderable and permanent augmentation, or a con&s;iderable diminu|tion, and none brought in its room, will, in a moderate &s;pace of time, produce a ri&s;e or fall of tho&s;e commodities which are in con&s;tant and general demand, allowing for accidental plenty or &s;carcity. Particular articles may ri&s;e even on a diminution of coin, or fall on an augmentation, the demand for the&s;e depending on fa&s;hion, whim or fancy. To a clear head, the whole doctrine of demand is ea&s;ily unfolded, and I hope my principle is now fully comprehended.</NOTE></P>
<P>On this principle, when coin is &s;ent out becau&s;e the prices of commodities will not allow an export, notwith&s;tanding they abound as much as u&s;ual, the quantity in other countries not being increa&s;ed, and the demand there continuing as it was, there is a pre&s;umption that the &s;tate has more than its proper &s;hare of &s;pecie. But if all the &s;urplus commodities be exported, and they are in&s;ufficient to pay for the merchandi&s;e brought in their &s;tead, the balance mu&s;t be remitted in coin, or remain a debt to a foreign country. The latter was preci&s;ely our ca&s;e before the war. We imported from Great-Britain more than our to|bacco, and &s;ometimes wheat, and the little foreign trade allow|ed us, would pay for. Hence aro&s;e the <HI>"old di&s;tre&s;&s;ing"</HI> debt to Briti&s;h &s;ubjects. The commerce of this country was ma|naged principally by their factors. The&s;e did not make ample remittances. For a great part of their goods they took bonds; and without the revolution, the re&s;ult mu&s;t have been the ve&s;t|ing a great part of our real property in Briti&s;h merchants.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of America during her va&s;&s;allage, and indeed of mo&s;t dependent colonies, is different from that of indepen|dent
<PB N="24" REF="020403_0023_0FAF0232DD2ED728">
nations. This country was, in a manner, inacce&s;&s;ible to all but one people. The principle, that in every country there <HI>will</HI> be as much circulating ca&s;h as will repre&s;ent the labour and property &s;old, &amp;c. is meant only for an independent coun|try. Not having peru&s;ed all the books on this &s;ubject, I am not certain that &s;ome of my ideas are not entirely new. They ought not &s;urely, on that account, to be deemed le&s;s ju&s;t; and I hope, that my labours will throw a ray of light on a &s;ubject hereto|fore deemed ob&s;cure and impenetrable.</P>
<P>Wherefore bills of credit, bearing no intere&s;t, and redeem|able at a far di&s;tant period, &s;hould, in America alone, have been on a footing with &s;olid coin, has never yet been &s;uffici|ently explained.</P>
<P>Under the circum&s;tances of America before the war, the prices of her commodities were much higher than might have been expected from the quantity of her circulating ca&s;h. The&s;e prices were adju&s;ted on the principle of affording a rea&s;onable profit to the merchant who purcha&s;ed the &s;urplus for exporta|tion. The fact was, there was a kind of barter between America and her parent country, &s;o far as that &s;urplus extend|ed; and a credit was given for the balance. The&s;e colonies, having no mines, and their trade nearly confined to Great-Britain, it was impracticable to obtain the quantity of ca&s;h required by their dome&s;tic concerns, which would bear the due proportion to the property and labour <HI>to be</HI> bought and &s;old, and afford means of improving new plantations. Prices were re|gulated to a great degree by our intercour&s;e with Great-Bri|tain. Here then was the true nece&s;&s;ity of falling on &s;ome ex|pedient <HI>"for melting down &s;olid property."</HI> We could nor in|&s;titute banks for want of coin. If they had been in&s;tituted, the coin would have been drawn out by factors to make remit|tances, and the banks would have broken almo&s;t as &s;oon as in|&s;tituted. Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, with the addition that &s;peculation on government &s;ecurities had never yet been thought of, bills of credit, after a few bungling e&s;&s;ays, &s;ucceeded to a charm. Specie not being wanted for exportation, the factors having regulated their operations on a different plan, and do|me&s;tic purpo&s;es con&s;tituting almo&s;t the entire u&s;e for a circu|lating medium, the opinion of the people was ea&s;ily obtained; and as no &s;u&s;picions of the public faith had been created by in|fractions of public engagements, there was a mutual tacit con+&s;ent that the paper of each colony &s;hould be received by its neighbours.</P>

millions of &s;ouls, is not to be reckoned. When &pound;.200,000 are paid for debts to-day, what prevents it from being paid for other debts to-morrow? It is not annihilated by the fir&s;t pay|ment. It is not like a &s;oldier's ration, which, if it does its office to-day, is for ever gone, and another ration mu&s;t be provided for to-morrow. Let ju&s;tice take its cour&s;e, or fall upon &s;ome rational expedient for &s;atisfying both creditor and debtor. Let us on every occa&s;ion re&s;pect the public faith, and, without pur&s;uing any <HI>other extraordinary</HI> mea&s;ures, you would find, that in the cour&s;e of one year &pound;.100,000 might pay debts to the amount of more than a million.</P>
<P>The paper is, it &s;eems, devi&s;ed as a medium of taxes, and government is to furni&s;h you with &s;omething, wherewithal to pay it&s;elf. There is a novelty in the idea of a creditor's en|abling the debtor by a new loan to pay his debt, and of a right medium of taxes di&s;tinct from a medium of commerce or exchange. It may be prudent for a creditor &s;ometimes to venture a little further, in order that by aiding his debtor to execute a well laid &s;cheme, he may &s;ecure his whole debt. There is nothing like this promi&s;ed by the bill, and the rever&s;e would mo&s;t probably take place. "But the people, at pre&s;ent unable to pay &s;carcely anything, will be put into a condition to pay a tax of thirty &s;hillings in the hundred pounds." No &s;uch thing. It is clear, that the paper would not be lent from the trea&s;ury to one man in a hundred. Of the fir&s;t &pound;.100,000, 11,000 is de&s;tined to Baltimore county. No per&s;on can take le&s;s than &pound;.50, and &s;uppo&s;e none to take more. The fifties in 11,000 are only 220, and in that county there cannot be fewer than 4400 men chargeable with the tax. On the&s;e &s;up|po&s;itions then, only one man in twenty can borrow from the public. Suppo&s;e no per&s;on to borrow le&s;s than &pound;.500, and only one in 200 can be a borrower. I think in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of credit, few will borrow for the &s;ake of admini&s;tering to the nece&s;&s;ities of their neighbours. From all this, the plan appears inadequate to the purpo&s;e of furni&s;hing the people with the means of di&s;charging the tax.</P>
<P>But it is &s;aid, the medium being &s;upplied, the people may pro|cure it with their produce. Should the paper be really ca&s;h, the difficulty of procuring that, and of procuring &s;pecie, will be equal. An idea has been propagated, that &s;pecie has, all at once, vani&s;hed from the land. That is impo&s;&s;ible; becau&s;e there has been very little export of ca&s;h &s;ince the very late period, when a man could procure a rea&s;onable quantity for anything he had to &s;ell. Take notice that I admit, only for
<PB N="27" REF="020403_0026_0FAF0236F6647BF8">
the &s;ake of argument, that merchantable commodities or pro|vi&s;ions brought to any market in the &s;tate, do not command &s;pecie at this moment. I admit freely, that the artificial &s;car|city of ca&s;h, has lately and &s;uddenly increa&s;ed. The expec|tation, or the probability, or even the mere po&s;&s;ibility, of an emi&s;&s;ion, has determined mo&s;t men not to part with a &s;ingle &s;hilling of ca&s;h which they can con&s;i&s;tently pre&s;erve. Each expects to receive no more, and therefore, if he can avoid it, he will pay none. Let the paper &s;y&s;tem be fairly abandoned. Let the legi&s;lature in&s;pire a confidence, that contracts &s;hall be enforced, and the true medium which improvident laws have confined to private coffers, and perhaps reburied in the earth, will again circulate, and do its office.</P>
<P>I have been always &s;urpri&s;ed, when men of intelligence have inferred the actual &s;carcity of coin from the low prices of ne|groes, &s;tock, &amp;c. taken in execution. The demand for the&s;e things is much le&s;s than it was before the war; and as the quantity at market has increa&s;ed, it has followed from the in|variable principles of demand, that the prices are greatly dimi|ni&s;hed. The abundant articles of a gainful &s;peculation have ab&s;orbed all the &s;pare ca&s;h; and le&s;&s;ened the demand for tho&s;e things in which &s;avings of money were formerly inve&s;ted. To them too is owing that high premium for the u&s;e of money, which, after all, has been much oftener talked of than really given.</P>
<P>The &s;pirit of &s;peculation, however, has occa&s;ioned another conclu&s;ion equally fal&s;e. From the avidity with which a &s;mall cla&s;s of men has purcha&s;ed up public &s;ecurities, is inferred a confidence in government. It is plea&s;ant to infer this from a man's purcha&s;ing at four, &s;ix, and eight for one, when it is evident that he purcha&s;es with a view of di&s;po&s;ing of them in a &s;hort time to advantage. His reliance on the public faith would indeed be effectually proved, if he purcha&s;ed at par, or hoarded them as &s;olid coin.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t plau&s;ible argument for an emi&s;&s;ion, is the oppor|tunity offered, if we had ca&s;h, of &s;inking our &s;hare of the con|tinental dome&s;tic debt with far le&s;s than the &s;um due to credi|tors. <Q>Final &s;ettlements may be procured at &s;ix or eight for one. Should they not be obtained with bills of credit, the&s;e bills will neverthele&s;s procure flour and tobacco. And as &s;pecie is not in the &s;tate, the&s;e articles are to be &s;ent out, and the &s;tate becomes a merchant.</Q> Let us examine freely this whole proce&s;s.</P>

taxes? How much time will be con&s;umed in procuring tobac|co (I will not a&s;k the price) &s;hipping it, and bringing back coin in its &s;tead? Do you &s;uppo&s;e that the &s;tate will trade to advantage? In whom &s;hall it confide? The other &s;tates being competitors, is it not probable the price of &s;ecurities will be advanced before this proce&s;s can furni&s;h the ca&s;h? I put the&s;e queries to evince the &s;uperiority of the plan mentioned by the &s;enate. To the plan, however, of an emi&s;&s;ion to be exchanged immediately for &s;ecurities at a rea&s;onable rate, it has been deemed &s;ufficient to object the benefit which would accrue to ADVENTURERS. But it would &s;eem, that the delegates plan would not be le&s;s favourable to adventurers. They are ad|venturers chiefly from whom &s;ecurities can <HI>now</HI> be obtained. The addre&s;s &s;ays, that the propo&s;ed paper can depreciate only a trifle, and intimates, that the &s;enate's would depreciate to a great degree. Surely, the more valuable the paper, exchanged for &s;ecurities at a given rate, the more benefit will be derived to adventurers. I will not be under&s;tood to advocate the &s;cheme hinted at by the &s;enate. I di&s;dain all &s;pecies of deception. I reprobate all kinds of paper; and, if I can &s;ugge&s;t a more eli|gible mode of obtaining <HI>facilities,</HI> this la&s;t argument in its fa|vour mu&s;t fall to the ground.</P>
<P>The addre&s;s compliments you on your <HI>"&s;olid property,"</HI> and a&s;&s;erts the difficulty of di&s;charging the tax to be owing more to the want of a medium, than to your embarra&s;&s;ed circum|&s;tances.</P>
<P>We may account much better for the default in collections, than from the inability of the people. Does the middling and mo&s;t valuable cla&s;s of citizens complain of the tax? Are <HI>they</HI> incapable of paying? Are <HI>they</HI> in arrears? If they are, is the fault imputable to <HI>them?</HI> Suppo&s;e an indu&s;trious planter po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of 300 acres of tolerable land, 4 or 5 working hands, and &s;tock, &amp;c. in proportion. This property is perhaps a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed to &pound;.700. Suppo&s;e the produce he rai&s;es for &s;ale to bring only &pound;.140. A tax of 20<HI>&s;</HI> in the &pound;.100 requires &pound;.7, the twen|tieth part of his income. The calculation is ea&s;y and plain. Con&s;ider now the ca&s;e of the poor, in who&s;e favour we have heard &s;uch moving declamation. To men of very minute ca|pitals it makes &s;carcely a palpable difference, whether taxes be high or low, receivable in paper, or in coin only. But now turn to men of overgrown property, with their thou&s;ands of acres, and hundreds of &s;laves. On the&s;e taxation is heavy; becau&s;e their annual incomes, in proportion, are &s;mall. But who is there that pities a man for owing &pound;.100, when the
<PB N="29" REF="020403_0028_0FAF02394573A140">
debt ari&s;es merely from his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing perhaps 15,000? After all this mighty bu&s;tle then for the poor, the clamour is, in truth, rai&s;ed for the rich. The&s;e are the men who have &s;et the pernicious example of with-holding the tax. The&s;e are the men who declaim again&s;t heavy impo&s;itions, the want of a medium, and the nece&s;&s;ity of po&s;tponing collections. It is <HI>their</HI> pernici|ous influence, which even without their intending it, may have prevented men both able and well-inclined from paying their public dues, and prevented money, after being paid, from coming to the trea&s;ury.</P>
<P>That you may not &s;uppo&s;e I affect &s;uperior wi&s;dom on all "political and con&s;titutional que&s;tions," I acknowledge that the original hint of the plan I mean to propo&s;e was borrowed from a member of the legi&s;lature. And that the whole of my rea&s;oning may be more candidly received, I further acknow|ledge, that mo&s;t of my ideas are borrowed&mdash;not indeed prin|cipally from books. The&s;e too often contain the wild dreams of vi&s;ionary projectors, or of men attached to a fine &s;pun theo|ry. I would be a&s;hamed to quote any writer beyond the At|lantic on a &s;ubject relative to bills of credit; becau&s;e tho&s;e wri|ters can rea&s;on only on &s;peculation; and becau&s;e, in America, we have experience to give every ob&s;erving man more real knowledge than could po&s;&s;ibly have been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by &s;uch a man as Sir James Stewart. Not that I de&s;pi&s;e his book. It is a repo&s;itory of much u&s;eful knowledge; and where he con|fines him&s;elf to facts or principles e&s;tabli&s;hed by experience, his work is extremely valuable. I take particular notice of this la|borious writer, becau&s;e his volumes have been produced on account of his authority. Neither he nor Ari&s;tides, nor any other man, &s;hould have any influence to which his rea&s;ons ad|duced do not entitle him.</P>
<P>It is well known, that in Europe almo&s;t any &s;ums may be borrowed on ample &s;ecurity. The intere&s;t is from two and an half to five per cent. Neither congre&s;s, nor any individual &s;tate, could perhaps borrow even &pound;.1,000 upon any terms, on the faith of government <HI>generally</HI> pledged. But &s;uppo&s;e the paper &s;cheme entirely di&s;carded, and an act of a&s;&s;embly im|po&s;ing a tax of 6/3 in the &pound;.100 for ten years, for the &s;ole and expre&s;s purpo&s;e of procuring a loan, and authority given to pro|per per&s;ons to negotiate it in Europe, the principal payable one tenth annually, and an intere&s;t in the mean time, not exceed|ing eight per cent. Such a &s;cheme has been tried by no &s;tate in the union. I have no doubt that this high intere&s;t, and this abundant &s;ecurity, would tempt monied men in Europe to ad|vance,
<PB N="30" REF="020403_0029_0FAF023992588C68">
and that, by this expedient, we might procure ca&s;h far more &s;peedily than under the paper &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>In Europe money is frequently inve&s;ted in public funds, for the &s;ake of &s;ecurity, and for e&s;tabli&s;hing a &s;ure annual income, without trouble or diminution of the capital. Some of the per&s;ons who thus lay out their money, have no thought, at the time, of ever receiving back the principal; but they have it in their power at any time to receive it by &s;elling out. Such is one great advantage that a well ordered government enjoys by having in&s;pired a confidence in the public. It is not pro|bable at this period, that men could be found willing to lend us on any rea&s;onable terms, without a &s;tipulation of receiving the principal at a fixed time. I therefore propo&s;e to borrow two hundred thou&s;and pounds for ten years. A tax of &s;ix &s;hillings and three-pence in the &pound;.100, on 11,000,000 of property, gives the gro&s;s &s;um of &pound;.34,375. Suppo&s;e it to produce, in ten years, only enough to di&s;charge the equivalent of a tenth of the principal annually, with the intere&s;t accruing, until the whole be paid, and the expence of the negotiation. On this plan we borrow immediately &pound;.200,000; and that &s;um laid out in continental &s;ecurities would purcha&s;e, at five for one, to the amount of &pound;.1,000,000, which is con&s;iderably more than our balance of the continental dome&s;tic debt, at pre&s;ent bearing intere&s;t. It is incumbent on me to explain how the contract is to be made.</P>
<P>Should we agree to pay actually a tenth of the principal an|nually, and the whole intere&s;t due at the end of the year, our payments would be made in the following manner: In the fir&s;t year we &s;hould have to pay &pound;.20,000 of the principal, with the intere&s;t on the whole, which at eight per cent. would be &pound;.16,000.&mdash;Total 36,000. In the &s;econd year &pound;.20,000 more of the principal, and the intere&s;t on the remaining &pound;.180,000, which would be &pound;.14,400&mdash;Total &pound;.34,400 Let us &s;tate every payment.&mdash;</P>

<P>But as the plan would not rai&s;e enough for the fir&s;t years, I would propo&s;e, that the gro&s;s &s;um of &pound;.28,800, being a tenth of the amount, be paid at the end of every year, and then for

&pound;.200,000 immediately advanced, the lender would, in ten years, receive &pound;.288,000. And be&s;ides, the annual payments might be immediately placed out by him at intere&s;t in Europe.

<P>Should we calculate on compound intere&s;t, the difference would not be &s;o great, although &s;till very con&s;iderable. I have made the above calculation to evince, that my &s;cheme would probably &s;ucceed. The &s;tipulation with the lender ought to be, that he &s;hould &s;u&s;tain no lo&s;s from tardy payments.</P>
<P>I be&s;eech cool di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate men to compare the &s;everal plans. The propo&s;er of the la&s;t, &s;ears not the imputation of &s;ini&s;ter views. It is propo&s;ed in &s;incerity, and relied on by the author. It were ea&s;y to demon&s;trate how deeply &s;ome men may be intere&s;ted in an emi&s;&s;ion. I forbear from re&s;pect. I dete&s;t per&s;onality. The attempt to injure my reputation excites no re&s;entment. I pity the &s;lave to malignant pa&s;&s;ions. Were the attack even &s;uch as to endanger my good name, recrimination would at be&s;t be a paltry mode of defence.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="020403_0031_0FAF023B1864B0A0">The operations under the loan would be this: It would entitle us to draw bills, which being &s;old in Philadelphia, would bring &s;pecie to the &s;tate; and the agents or com|mi&s;&s;ioners of the loan might make their annual payments by tobacco.</P>
<P>Were the hint adopted, I might &s;ugge&s;t other things in the draught of the bill. It might perhaps plea&s;e the lenders to have a power of appointing their own collectors, who&s;e re|ceipts, produced by the people to our collectors, might be al|lowed and charged to their principal. Amendments might occur; but I am &s;atisfied the outline de&s;erves well the atten|tion of the legi&s;lature. It is a &s;cheme to deliver this &s;tate of an annual burthen of &pound;.60,000, at the expence of a 6/3 tax, for only ten years, and this without producing di&s;&s;en&s;ions among the people, or violating public faith.</P>
<P>To men of &s;elfi&s;h contracted minds, who mea&s;ure not on the large &s;cale of general good, the profit to be gained by an emi&s;&s;ion on loan, may be very alluring. The translator of Mr. Necker on bank-notes, has demon&s;trated, that the gain never could be made. Suppo&s;e it &s;hould; the burthen of contribut|ing &s;o much to the public revenue mu&s;t fall heavily &s;omewhere. It would to all intents and purpo&s;es be a tax, and a very un|equal one. If an equal moderate tax cannot be paid, it will re|quire &s;omething more than &s;ound to prove, that an unequal one, without lo&s;s or deduction, will come into the trea&s;ury. The fact is, that public debtors already con&s;titute a numerous and powerful body; and it cannot be good policy to augment it. The&s;e debtors have either had value from the public, or e&s;caped burthens borne by the re&s;t. Their debts are ju&s;t, and ought to be paid. By increa&s;ing their number, is there no cau&s;e to apprehend a pernicious combination? Should the thought here|after &s;ugge&s;t it&s;elf, that the be&s;t &s;tep for a public debtor is to procure a &s;eat in the great public councils, you will run the hazard either of having your burthens greatly increa&s;ed, or of a public bankruptcy, the ruin of your creditors, con|vul&s;ions in the &s;tate, and ultimately the de&s;truction of your freedom.</P>
<P>I proceed to a more invidious dangerous ta&s;k. Do thou &s;acred love of truth a&s;&s;i&s;t and bear me up! It is by plain &s;im|ple calculation to demon&s;trate the mi&s;takes in the delegates ad|dre&s;s. It has mi&s;tated your re&s;ources, and exaggerated your embarra&s;&s;ments. Its errors are amazing, and the following in&s;tances &s;hall e&s;tabli&s;h my charge</P>

<P>The idea of private oeconomy and frugality extricating us from all embarra&s;&s;ments, has been ridiculed. It has been <HI>tri|umphantly</HI> &s;aid, that a free government cannot prevent men from &s;pending their money, or living as they plea&s;e. It is true, that government cannot limit the number of di&s;hes at a man's table, the quantity of madeira, to be con&s;umed in a year, or the kind and number of his carriages. But when men, having by a thoughtle&s;s profu&s;ion incurred heavy debts, are obliged to retrench, and begin &s;eriou&s;ly to reform, the legi&s;lature may certainly forbear to furni&s;h them with the means of continuing their extravagance, enhancing their debt, and only po&s;tponing their evil day. Would not, I pray you, an emi&s;&s;ion operate in this way for the borrowers? Would it not again hurry men into their wild ill concerted &s;chemes? But government can go further than a mere forbearance. It can encourage home ma|nufactures. It can either prohibit certain importations, or lay &s;uch a duty as would an&s;wer three good ends, an increa&s;e of its revenue, a diminution of imports, and a di&s;couragement of luxury. The force of prejudice, and the magic of declama|tion, mu&s;t be great indeed, to prevent men from &s;eeing the&s;e glaring truths!</P>

But from our &s;ituation the&s;e debts mu&s;t be &s;lowly paid, and it is proper to adopt &s;ome fair mode of compo&s;ition, or in&s;tallment <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This might be termed a violation of pa&s;t contracts, if cre|ditors were not univer&s;ally con&s;enting to the mea&s;ure.</NOTE>.

<P>The emi&s;&s;ion would afford the &s;trong body of public debtors &s;uch an acce&s;&s;ion of influence, as, if they plea&s;ed, might pro|duce a combination not to be with&s;tood. &pound;.250,000 divided into five hundreds, might po&s;&s;ibly give 500 new debtors.

How contemptible the &s;u&s;picions &s;ugge&s;ted again&s;t the &s;enate, compared to the well grounded apprehen&s;ions, which the&s;e might excite!</P>
<P>The addre&s;s &s;ays nothing of the two and a half impo&s;t, as a productive fund in ea&s;e of the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment. I am <HI>mo&s;t credibly</HI> informed, that the product of this tax, in 1786, appeared to the hou&s;e to be &pound;.33,093 9 8. This ought undoubtedly to have le&s;&s;ened their e&s;timate of an a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed rate, about 6/8 in the &pound;.100.</P>
<P>I come now to the account of the continental debts.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If gentlemen are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any means to correct my &s;tate of the debt, let them do it. When wrong, I ever wi&s;h that I may be &s;et right</NOTE> On the fir&s;t of January, 1783, the foreign debt, according to the publi&s;hed e&s;timate of congre&s;s, was 7,885,085 dollars. It has not &s;ince been increa&s;ed, except by arrears of intere&s;t, and &s;ome loans, which have been applied to pay off the old intere&s;t, and maintain mini&s;ters and agents. Suppo&s;e it to be now rai&s;ed to 10,000,000 dollars, bearing an intere&s;t of five per cent. Our tenth of that &s;um is only 1,000,000, equal to &pound;.375,000, the intere&s;t of which is only &pound;.18,750: So that the addre&s;s has erred in &s;tating the intere&s;t of the foreign debt to be 1,723,626 dollars; becau&s;e that is an intere&s;t at five per cent. on the enormous &s;um of 34, 472,520 dollars. Congre&s;s however is under an obligation to pay a part of the principal of the foreign debt at this time. Hence it is, that for the year 1786, they have called on the &s;tates for a &s;um, not to be paid every year. And hence it is, mo&s;t probably, that the addre&s;s has &s;o materially mi&s;tated the annual intere&s;t of the foreign debt. There is indeed a great difficulty in compre|hending the exact &s;tate of continental affairs. Since the year 1783, there has been no &s;tatement from congre&s;s that has
<PB N="38" REF="020403_0037_0FAF0241DC224540">
been, at the &s;ame time, full, explicit, intelligible and clear. It is no wonder that new requi&s;itions, balances of the old, in|tere&s;t now due, intere&s;ts annually ari&s;ing, a million of figures, and references to &s;tatements not at hand, &s;hould perplex an ordinary brain, and produce mi&s;takes. But a common man, without a full comprehen&s;ion of the &s;ubject, would not have undertaken to publi&s;h for the information of others. From the whole body of the delegates, in an appeal to their con&s;titu|ents, nothing but accuracy and preci&s;ion ought to be expected; and a con&s;iderable time actually elap&s;ed before I ever thought of que&s;tioning their &s;tatements and calculations. That I was wrong in taking any thing upon tru&s;t, I hope already appears.</P>
<P>I will now pre&s;ent you a more complete general view of your affairs, than any you have yet &s;een. My groundwork for the &s;tate of the continental debt, is the e&s;timate of 1783, which I am well a&s;&s;ured is the groundwork that has ever &s;ince &s;erved congre&s;s it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The continental debt ari&s;es in a great mea&s;ure from a non|compliance with their requi&s;itions. Suppo&s;e the whole debt to be 50,000,000 of dollars, and that although a &s;tate has not complied fully with the&s;e requi&s;itions, it has complied in as great a proportion as the re&s;t. Now the&s;e fifty millions are apportioned. Surely a &s;tate cannot owe its quota of the debt, and its balance of requi&s;itions at the &s;ame time. Congre&s;s, however, being di&s;appointed in one year, in the next year makes a new requi&s;ition, and calls for the balance of &s;ome former demand, in order to prevent the accumulation of her principal debt, and to comply with her po&s;itive engagements. Could congre&s;s think proper, and could all its creditors agree, to convert the whole debt into a principal, bearing intere&s;t, and would the &s;tates obey their ju&s;t requi&s;itions in providing permanent funds, the burthen would every year be equal, their affairs &s;implified, and errors not likely to be made. But of this hereafter.</P>
<P>The foreign debt paying intere&s;t, I have before &s;tated in 1783 to be 7,885,085 dollars.</P>

<P>To rai&s;e this la&s;t &s;um, &s;uppo&s;e a recour&s;e to the old mode of a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment. Seven &s;hillings and &s;ix-pence in the &pound;.100 on 11 millions of property, gives &pound;.41,250 gro&s;s, which &s;urely might produce more than &pound;.37,000 net. The two rates of 6/3 and 7/6, with the 2/6 impo&s;ed by the con&s;olidating act, make 16/3. And this, upon the plaine&s;t calculation, is the whole burthen nece&s;&s;ary to be borne along with the 2&frac12; per cent. for your whole continental and dome&s;tic debt, and the liberal &s;upport of government. To this add 3/9 for county charges, which you are &s;en&s;ible ought to be le&s;s than at pre&s;ent. And your whole burthen is ju&s;t twenty &s;hillings annually for every &pound;.100. From this 2/6 are to be &s;hortly deducted, and
<PB N="42" REF="020403_0041_0FAF0245235F9678">
6/3 more are to cea&s;e at the end of ten years, and then the rate will be only 11/3.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e my &s;cheme for a loan rejected, you have then to provide for an annual intere&s;t of &pound;.60,000, until we can &s;ink the principal. In that ca&s;e twelve &s;hillings, in&s;tead of the 6/3, would be required. And then your whole contribution (exclu&s;ive of the 2&frac12; duty) to congre&s;s, the &s;tate and the county, would be 25/9 until the deduction of the 2/6, which would reduce it to 23/3.

They may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that one of the fir&s;t wi&s;hes of my &s;oul, is to live in amity with all.&mdash;Let that be the principle of all! May the &s;ufferings of their country awaken a true zeal, and uniting in her cau&s;e, they will bid fair at la&s;t to coale&s;ce in brotherly love.</P>
