<Q>Honoured, Reverend, much Re&s;pected, and Beloved in the Lord,</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>I Who am of the Lea&s;t, the mo&s;t Unable, and Unworthy of all your Servants in the Lord, am called at this time to Preach before this Great, and Good A&s;&s;embly, an A&s;&s;embly of the Cho&s;en People of the Lord: The Choice, the Be&s;t, the mo&s;t Wife, the mo&s;t Able in the Province; an A&s;&s;embly, which is yet accounted (notwith|&s;tanding a great Declen&s;ion and Degeneracy) the mo&s;t truly Honourable, Venerable, Pious, and Re|ligious, of any in the <HI>We&s;tern World.</HI> This Land was Sown with good Seed, planted with choice Vines, Men generally Vertuous, Pious and Reli|gious. Religion was their main intere&s;t; it was no Worldly de&s;ign, but meerly on the account of Religion; they came to the&s;e remote Ends of the Earth, a va&s;t and howling Wilderne&s;s: God &s;ig|nally owned, and ble&s;&s;ed them in their great, and
<PB REF="001369_0003_0FB292B4C10CC4B0">
dangerous Undertaking, God was <HI>with them,</HI> and it was well with them. God was a <HI>Wall of fire round about them,</HI> and their glory in the mid&s;t of them: No weapons formed again&s;t them Pro&s;pe|red; Coun&s;els were turned to Fooli&s;hne&s;s. <HI>We have heard with our Ears, and our Fathers have told us, what God did for them in their days, How He did drive out the Heathen, and Planted them; they got not the Land in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion by their own Sword, neither did their own Arm &s;ave them.</HI> They were <HI>with God,</HI> and God was with them: They Sought and Served God, God Pro&s;pered them: They Sought the Kingdom of God in the fir&s;t Place; They had the additional Ble&s;&s;ings of Heaven, and Earth, Sea and Land: From Small beginnings, in few years they became a Flouri&s;hing, and con&s;iderable Plan|tation. But &s;ince their days, their Po&s;terity, and Succe&s;&s;ors have much Degenerated: <HI>As we have increa&s;ed, &s;o we have Sinned, and Provoked the Lord again&s;t us.</HI> We have changed our Ways and In|tere&s;t in great mea&s;ure; God hath changed his Ways, and dealings towards us. God hath Wit|ne&s;&s;ed again&s;t us by variety of Judgments for a long time. We have been Impoveri&s;hed, brought Low, Afflicted, many evils and troubles have befallen us; e&s;pecially the <HI>Sword,</HI> a cruel Sword; a Cruel Barbarous Enemy. The Sword God is not wont to draw upon His People when le&s;s Cha&s;ti&s;ements are effectual. Here hath been great Declen&s;ion: God hath been greatly Pro|voked; <HI>How is our Gold become dim, and our fine Gold changed?</HI> This is matter of Lamentation!
<PB REF="001369_0004_0FB293458CADC9E0">
and that which is greater, We are &s;till Declining, notwith&s;tanding all Means u&s;ed to prevent and to reduce.</P>
<P>I &s;hall therefore endeavour to apply my &s;elf in &s;uch manner, as I judge mo&s;t &s;uitable to a People &s;o circum&s;tanced. <HI>Deo annuente, et adju|vante.</HI> God needeth no In&s;truments: He can work with them, or without them, as in plea|&s;eth Him. The <HI>be&s;t</HI> can do nothing <HI>without</HI> God; the <HI>weake&s;t</HI> can do much <HI>with</HI> God. God's Strength is made perfect in Weakne&s;s, 1 Cor. 3.7. <HI>He that planteth is not any thing, nor he that watereth, but God that giveth the increa&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>I would not offend any Per&s;on, nor offer any thing, but what might be agreeable to all; yet to plea&s;e all I account a thing next to impo&s;&s;i|ble; <HI>Quot Capita tot Sen&s;us. Omnes non idem Sapiunt.</HI> I de&s;ire not the Prai&s;e of Men, I de&s;ire to plea&s;e God above all: I de&s;ire God may give me His Grace &s;o to do. Give what He may accept and accept what He gives.</P>

<P><PB REF="001369_0005_0FB29346F9517258">THIS Book is called by the Hebrews, <HI>Vajedabber,</HI> from the fir&s;t words: And (the Lord) <HI>Said.</HI> Some-times <HI>Bemidbar,</HI> that is, <HI>In the Wilderne&s;s,</HI> where the&s;e things were acted. According to the Greek Title, it is called <HI>Numbers</HI>; &s;o called from the many Numbrings recorded in the Book. The mo&s;t re|markable Numbring we have in <HI>Numb.</HI> 1.1, 2, 3.

put you in remembrance, how the Lord having &s;aved his People out of Egypt, afterward de&s;troyed them.</HI> The Contents of this Book are partly <HI>Doctrinal,</HI> partly <HI>Hi&s;torical</HI>: The Doctrinal part contains ad|ditions, explanations of &s;undry Laws, Moral, Ju|dicial, mostly Ceremonial. The Hi&s;torical part containeth the most remarkable things, the Chil|dren of I&s;rael did, or &s;uffered in the De&s;ert, by the &s;pace of Thirty-nine years: Dangers, Delive|rances, Troubles, Travels, Provocations, Puni&s;h|ments. In the Fourteenth Chapter we have re|corded, a Rebellion that did con&s;ummate their Provocation, and compleat their Sin, and pro|cured their utter De&s;truction. God will bear no longer: He will utterly con&s;ume them; there is no remedy. <HI>Ver&s;e 28. Say unto them, as I live &s;aith the Lord, their Carca&s;es &s;hall fall in the Wilderne&s;s.</HI> Ver&s;e 35. <HI>In the Wilderne&s;s they &s;hall be con&s;umed, and there they &s;hall die.</HI> God minds that this is now the Tenth time, v. 22. <HI>They have tempted me now the&s;e ten times.</HI> God remembers, though men forget. Ten is &s;ometimes put for many: <HI>Numerus certus pro incerto.</HI> But here it may be taken properly, for ten times. 1. At the Red-Sea, Exod. 14.11, 12.2. At Marah, <HI>Exod.</HI> 15.23, 24. Again in the Wil|derne&s;s of Sin, Exod. 16.2. Then twice about Manna, Exod. 16.20, 27, 28. After at Rephidim, <HI>Exod.</HI> 17. Then by the Calf at Horeb, <HI>Exod.</HI> 32. At <HI>Taborah, Numb.</HI> 11.1. Again at <HI>Kebroth Hatta|avah, Numb.</HI> 11.4. Now the tenth time in <HI>Pharan.</HI> Of this provocation, we have,</P>

report brought of the Promi&s;ed Land by the in|credulous Spies, <HI>Numb.</HI> 13.32. <HI>It is a Land that eat|eth up the Inhabitants thereof, the People we &s;aw in it, are men of great Stature. There we &s;aw the giants, and the Sons of Anak, that came of giants: we were in our own &s;ight as gra&s;hoppers, &s;o we were in their &s;ight.</HI> We are not able to go up again&s;t the People, for they are &s;tronger than we.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Rebellion. <HI>Chap.</HI> 14.1.&mdash;4. (1.) An ante|cedent, v. 1. <HI>All the Congregation lifted up their voice and cryed, and the People wept that night.</HI> [<HI>Heb.</HI>] in, or through that Night. [<HI>Greek</HI>] that whole Night. This Lamentation was a Bitter fruit of their Unbe|lief. They believe not GOD that promi&s;ed the Land: They believe not Caleb, that tells them o|therwi&s;e, <HI>Numb.</HI> 13.30. <HI>Let us go up at once, and po&s;&s;e&s;s it, for we are able to over-come.</HI> Caleb &s;pake as was in his heart, <HI>Jo&s;h.</HI> 14.7. They believe not <HI>Jo|&s;hua</HI> and <HI>Caleb, Numb.</HI> 14.6.&mdash;9. <HI>The Land is an ex|ceeding good Land: a Land flowing with Milk &amp; Honey. Only rebel ye not again&s;t the Lord, neither fear ye the People, for they are bread for us: Their defence is departed from them, the Lord is with us: fear them not.</HI> (2.) The Rebellion and Provocation. 2, 3, 4. ver&s;es. <HI>All the Children of I&s;rael murmured again&s;t Mo&s;es and again&s;t Aaron: and the whole congregation &s;aid, would God we had dyed in Egypt, in the Wilder|ne&s;s. Wherefore hath God brought us into this Land to fall by the Sword. Let us make us a Captain: Let us return into Egypt.</HI> But alas! how &s;hould they Live in the barren de&s;ert? how &s;hould they get thither? Would God work more Wonders for &s;uch Rebels?
<PB REF="001369_0008_0FB2934C33534070">
Ver&s;e 10. <HI>All the Congregation had Stone them with Stones.</HI> They had almo&s;t done the like to Mo&s;es, <HI>Exod.</HI> 17.4. They after Stoned the Prophets, &mdash;Killed them. Here &s;ee what good Men may meet with from an evil Murmuring People. Think it not Strange to &s;ee it. No wonder they carry them&s;elves &s;o to good Men, that &s;o do to the good GOD.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Con&s;equents of it, in the following Ver&s;es: God is Highly provoked; God threaten|eth pre&s;ent de&s;truction. By Mo&s;es's interce&s;&s;ion they are &s;pared as to that, v. 13.&mdash;20. Yet they &s;hall not &s;ee the Land, they &s;hall bear their iniquity till they be con&s;umed. They that brought the evil report died of the Plague before the Lord. <HI>As I Live &s;aith the Lord,</HI> the Earth &s;hall be filled with the Glory of the Lord. Another Con&s;equent you have in the Words of the Text; which are a great complaint God makes to Mo&s;es, of the People, they are al&s;o Minatory. In the Text, v. 11. (1.) The party complaining, GOD: the God of I&s;rael; God that brought them out of the Land of Egypt. (2.) The Object complained to, <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI> Here God acts with Mo&s;es, as a Man in trouble would do with his Friend; make known his mind and grievances to him. (3.) The Subject com|plain'd of: <HI>This People.</HI> This People in way of In|dignation and Aver&s;ation: not <HI>My People,</HI> as &s;ome|times. (4.) The Matter of the complaint. 1. They Provoke Me; they Provok'd long: <HI>How long will This People Prevoke</HI>? De&s;pi&s;e, Provoke contemptu|ou&s;ly. 2. They believe not Me; [<HI>Greek] In Me:
<PB REF="001369_0009_0FB2934E935EE0A8">
[Chald.] My Word.</HI> This their Unbelief was the cau&s;e of their Rebellion, and &s;o of their ruin and de&s;truction. For brevity I &s;hall take up but one Doctrinal Conclu&s;ion, which is all I &s;hall make u&s;e of.</P>
<P><HI>DOCT.</HI> That Unbelief is a Great Evil, and a cau&s;e of tho&s;e Evils, and Provocations, where|by Per&s;ons Provoke the Almighty God to Wrath again&s;t them, to their De&s;truction.</P>
<P>This we &s;ee here. Thus it was with the Chil|dren of I&s;rael, in the Wilderne&s;s. This Mo&s;es a|gain mentioneth, Deut. 1.32. <HI>You did not believe the Lord your God: And the Lord was Wrath, and Swear, &s;aying, There is not one of this evil Congregation &s;hall &s;ee the good Land.</HI> The Apo&s;tle, Heb. 3.18. <HI>To whom Swear be they &s;hould not enter, but to them that believ|ed not.</HI> Thus it was with their Po&s;terity afterward, 2 King. 17.14. <HI>God te&s;tifyed again&s;t Israel and again&s;t Judah, by all his Prophets, &s;aying, Turn ye from your Evil ways; but they would not bear, but hardened their Necks like their Fathers that did not believe in the Lord their God.</HI> Therefore the Lord removed them out of his fight, rejected all the Seed of I&s;rael; deli|vered them into the hands of Spoilers. I&s;rael was carryed out of their own Land, into the Land of A&s;&s;yria to this day. Thus with the Jews, Rom. 11.20. <HI>Becau&s;e of Unbelief they were broken off.</HI> Thus with the old World. Unbelief brought the Uni|ver&s;al deluge, 1 Pet. 3.19. <HI>By which he Preached to the Spirits in Pri&s;on</HI>; which were di&s;obedient in
<PB REF="001369_0010_0FB2935008B45138">
the days of <HI>Noah.</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">. Unbelieving. Un|belief was the door let in Sin, Death and Sorrow into the World. Satan him&s;elf tempted Eve to Unbelief, Gen. 3.4. <HI>Ye &s;hall not &s;urely dye.</HI> Satan was harken'd to. God was not believed, Gen. 2.17. <HI>In the day thou eate&s;t thereof thou &s;halt &s;urely die.</HI> So the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion was committed; the forbid|den fruit eaten; the Glory departed; Man fallen. All Mankind, all of Man, every Man. Man is not what he was: was not what he is: He was once glorious: <HI>Crowned with Glory and Honour,</HI> P&s;al. 8.5. Now filthy and abominable. Job 15.16. <HI>There is none that doeth good, no not one,</HI> Rom. 3.10. &amp;c. Man was once happy, ble&s;&s;ed: Now under Wrath, cur&s;ed, mi&s;erable. Man was God's Image: Sin is Man's Image: Mi&s;ery Sin's Image. Man is God's Creature: Sin is Man's Creature: Mi&s;ery Sin's Creature. <HI>Unbelief</HI> was the door that let in Sin, and Mi&s;ery into the World; and it is Unbelief that now Perpetuates it. Unbelief is di&s;honorable to God; de&s;tructive to Man: Departeth from God, leads to Sin, and rebellion again&s;t God: Keeps Men Ob&s;tinate in Sin, Perpetuates Sin; and &s;o the bitter fruits of Sin, Sorrows and Mi&s;eries.</P>
<P><HI>But more Particularly,</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Unbelief departs from God, Duty and Obe|dience: Faith Obeyeth, Unbelief di&s;obeys.</P>
<P N="2">2. Unbelief carries men to Sin, any Sin, all Sin. It is a fruitful Mother of a World of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions. It ca&s;ts off the fear of God: Where there is no fear of God, there is no Con&s;cience of Sin. No Con|&s;cience
<PB REF="001369_0011_0FB2935173F888F0">
of Sin, what Sin is it men will not com|mit? The Apo&s;tle having &s;et down a Catalogue of Sins, concludeth with this as a cau&s;e of all the re&s;t; <HI>There is no fear of God before their Eyes,</HI> Rom. 3.18. Unbelief defileth the heart, blinds the mind, feareth the Con&s;cience; to Mans Natural, it addeth a contracted Hardne&s;s, that they become pa&s;t feeling, <HI>Eph.</HI> 4.13.</P>
<P N="3">3. It holds men ob&s;tinate in Sin, that they will not be reclaimed. (1) It rendereth the Means u&s;ed to bring men to repent, &amp; reform; vain, and ineffectual; In&s;tructions, Directions, Per&s;wa&s;ions, Di&s;&s;wa&s;ions, Promi&s;es, Threats; The Word, the Rod: The Word profiteth not without Faith; the Rod profits not, <HI>In vain have I &s;mitten, why &s;hould you be &s;mitten any more</HI>? (2) It fills men with Athei&s;m; to conclude, either there is no God, or He is not &s;uch a God as He is declared to be. <HI>The fool hath &s;aid in his heart, There is no God,</HI> P&s;al. 14.1. What follows, <HI>They are corrupt, they have done abominable Works, there is none that doeth good.</HI> Unbelief &s;aith, God &s;eeth not: Job 22.13, 14. <HI>Thou &s;aye&s;t how doth God Know, can he judge through the dark cloud. Thick Clouds are a covering to him, He &s;eeth not.</HI> P&s;al. 94.7. <HI>They &s;ay, the Lord doth not see, neither doth the God of Jacob regard it.</HI> Zeph. 1.12. <HI>That &s;ay in their heart God will not do good, neither will he do evil.</HI> (3) It regards neither Law nor Go&s;pel. It de&s;pi|&s;es the Promi&s;es: derideth the Threats, I&s;a. 5.19. <HI>They &s;ay let him make &s;peed, and ha&s;ten his work that we may &s;ee it. Let the Coun&s;el of the holy one come that we may Know it.</HI> They draw iniquity with cords,
<PB REF="001369_0012_0FB29354E9EBDF60">
and Sin with Cartropes. (4) It abu&s;eth the good|ne&s;s, and long-&s;uffering of God, which &s;hould lead to Repentance; to Harden in Sin, Eccl. 8.11. <HI>Be|cau&s;e Judgment again&s;t an evil work is not &s;peedily ex|ecuted: therefore the hearts of the Sons of men are fully &s;et to do evil.</HI> But let &s;uch know, that the longer Judgment is delayed, the Heavier it will be when it cometh. Rom. 9.22. <HI>What if God willing to &s;hew his Wrath, and make his Power known, indured with long-&s;uffering the Ve&s;&s;els of wrath fitted for de&s;truction.</HI> It &s;hall come; it hath &s;ometime Leaden feet, but Iron hands. Sin &s;hall not go unpuni&s;hed. <HI>Your Sin &s;hall find you out: Though hand joyn in hand, the wicked &s;hall not go unpuni&s;hed.</HI> 1 Tim. 5.24, 25. <HI>Some mens Sins are open before hand, going before to judgment: and &s;ome they follow after. Likewi&s;e the good works of &s;ome are manife&s;t before hand, and they that are other|wi&s;e cannot be hid.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. As Unbelief holds men Ob&s;tinate in Sin, and Perpetuates Sin; So it Perpetuateth Mi&s;eries, the ju&s;t Puni&s;hment, and bitter fruit of Sin: Tempo|ral here, and eternal hereafter; everla&s;ting De|&s;truction; Men don't believe, therefore they don't obey: therefore they &s;hall be puni&s;hed <HI>with an Everla&s;ting De&s;truction from the Pre&s;ence of the Lord, &mdash; from the Glory of his Power,</HI> 2 The&s;. 1.9. <HI>A part in the Lake that burneth with Fire and Brim&s;tone, which is the Second Death.</HI> Rev. 21.8. <HI>But the fearful and unbe|lieving and abominable, and murderers, and whore|mongers,</HI> &amp;c. They are Unbelieving, therefore it is they are Fearful, Abominable, Whore-mongers, Sorcerers, &amp;c. and &s;o have their part in that Lake.
<PB REF="001369_0013_0FB29356B3468E70">
Now &s;ome USE and Improvement.
USE. I. See the great Evil of <HI>Unbelief.</HI> Evil in it's Self: Evil to GOD; Evil to Man; Evil in its fruits. It is a root of Bitterne&s;s, whence the gall and wormwood of Evils both Sinful and Painful proceed. Men are more ready to be convinced of, and charge them&s;elves with the guilt of other Sins than with <HI>this</HI>: yet this is a Mother Sin. The damning Sin. Mark 16.16. <HI>He that believeth &s;hall be &s;aved: he that believeth not &s;hall be damned. He that believeth not, &s;hall not &s;ee life: the wrath of God abideth on him.</HI> He that believeth &s;hall be Saved, were his Sins never &s;o many. He that believeth not &s;hall be damned, were his Sins never &s;o few.</P>
<P>USE. II. <HI>Examination.</HI> Are we guilty of this Sin of Unbelief? If we are, Let us &s;ee it: be convinced of it: Conviction of Unbelief is a &s;tep to Faith, and &s;o to Life, and Salvation; All Salva|tions, Temporal, Spiritual and Eternal.</P>
<P>Let me offer &s;omething in way of Trial, and Conviction.</P>
<P N="1">1. Have not we provoked the Lord our God; Provoked him greatly? Read the cau&s;e in the effect. Sin, in the Puni&s;hment. Have not Gods Judgments been great? Have not therefore our Sins been grievous? Would a gracious God, and merciful Father, who doth not willingly afflict, nor grieve the Children of men, Inflict &s;ore, and

Pray with <HI>Ephraim, Turn thou me, and I &s;hall be turned, for thou art the Lord my God.</HI> If God hear us with <HI>Ephraim</HI> bemoaning our Selves, He may &s;ay to us as he did to <HI>Ephraim,</HI> Jer. 3I.20. <HI>Is Ephraim my dear Son? is be my plea&s;ant Child: Since I &s;pake again&s;t him, I do earne&s;tly remember him &s;till: My bowels are troubled for him, I will &s;urely have Mercy on him, &s;aith the Lord.</HI></P>

<P N="1">1. Con&s;ider the Nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>Reforming.</HI> If we are not Reforming, we &s;hall be Deforming, Sinning; we &s;hall yet be more Sinful, and more Mi&s;erable. If the torrent, or flood of Vice be not Stopped, an over-flowing Scourge will follow, and over-take. Let Her <HI>Maje&s;ties</HI> Royal PRO|CLAMATION for Puni&s;hing Vice and Immora|lities, be attended, which She &s;o &s;trictly enjoyns, as they Tender God's Honour, Her Favour, their own Welfare. It might be great Advantage, were Her Maje&s;ties Royal Proclamation follow'd in <HI>New-England,</HI> as it was in <HI>Old-England,</HI> with <HI>Reforming Societies.</HI> Let the good Laws Enacted be duly Executed. A Violation of Laws is not &s;o hurtful, as a Non-execution. If we will not be Warned, when Warnings are given; Reformed, when Reproved; be prevailed with, when be&s;eeched; Regard, when threatned; be amended, when corrected; be purged, when God would purge us; What will our End be? Our fle&s;h may tremble! <HI>O that my People were Wi&s;e, that they would con&s;ider their latter end. O that there were &s;uch a heart in my People, that they would fear me, that it might be well with them, and their Children after them.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The Benefit, and Good of it. How happy might we then be? It would be well with us not|with&s;tanding all our Provocations; they &s;hould

be all blotted out, and remembred no more. <HI>The iniquities of Jacob &s;hall be &s;ought for, and there &s;hall be none; and the Sins of Judah, and they &s;hall not be found: for I will Pardon them.</HI> Could we grieve and mourn for our Sins, our Enemies &s;hould not long Rejoyce: God would be grieved for our Mi&s;eries, bind our Breaches, repair our Lo&s;&s;es, build up the wa&s;te Places; make glad according to the days we have &s;een Evil; Remove the evils we feel, Prevent the evils we fear, Be&s;tow the good things we want. God would be an Enemy to our Enemies; they that devour us, &s;hould be devoured; they that Spoil us, &s;hould be a Spoil; and they that Prey upon us, &s;hould be given for a Prey: the Enemies that come again&s;t us &s;hould be Smitten before us: they that come out again&s;t us One Way &s;hould flee before us Seven Ways; God would give Peace in the Land; we &s;hall dwell in Safety, and none &s;hall make us afraid: God would keep us Night and Day: He would Water us every Moment: So our La&s;t days might be our Be&s;t; and our Latter End better than our Beginning. Let tho&s;e that Love Sion Seek it, &s;ay, <HI>AMEN.</HI></P>
<P>Let GOD ble&s;s us, turn us from our Iniqui|ties heal our Back-&s;lidings, &s;ave us from <HI>Unbelief,</HI> give us to Believe to REFORMATION, and SALVATION. Let God even our God continue to be the Lord our God, to be with us, as with our Fathers; a God keeping Covenant and
