<HEAD>THE CHILDREN's FRIEND. <NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot">A book with the &s;ame title has been publi&s;hed by Mr. <HI>WEISSE,</HI> one of the mo&s;t celebrated Poets of Germany; whence the Author means to &s;elect, for his own work, what appears to him the mo&s;t excellent; as well as from the works of Me&s;&s;.

<HEAD>PROSPECTUS.</HEAD>
<P>THE de&s;ign of this work is to give amu&s;ement to Children, by the &s;ame means that will mo&s;t naturally lead them to Virtue, in con&s;tantly pre&s;enting it to their eyes, in its mo&s;t amiable form. In|&s;tead of tho&s;e extravagant fictions, and romantic wonders, with which their imaginations have &s;o long been led a&s;tray; they will here merely be offered &s;uch adventures, as they may them&s;elves almo&s;t daily be &s;pectators of in their own families. No attempt will be made to in&s;pire them with any &s;entiments above their con|ception and capacity; and they will only be brought into action with one another, with their parents, with their play-fellows, the dome&s;|tics who &s;urround them, and the animals to which they are mo&s;t accu&s;tomed. They will expre&s;s them&s;elves in their own &s;imple and unadorned language. Eagerly intere&s;ted in all that happens, they will artle&s;sly give way to every ri&s;ing emotion of their early feel|ings. They will then in their own faults find their puni&s;hment, in their own good actions their recompence. Every thing will concur to in&s;pire them with a love of goodne&s;s, as the means of happine&s;s, and an abhorrence of vice, as the &s;ource of mortification and mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>It is hardly nece&s;&s;ary to mention that this work is equally intended for children of both &s;exes.<NOTE N="(2)" PLACE="foot">A view of the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ions of the human heart, in the artle&s;s &s;cenes of ingenuous infancy, is perhaps, of all repre&s;enta|tions, the mo&s;t certain of attracting attention at every period of life. Young people, who&s;e minds are not corrupted, will look back with the tendere&s;t recollection, to that &s;weet early &s;ea&s;on, of which, though their natural impetuo&s;ity makes them ha&s;ten from it with little regret, they can never recall the ideas without delight, when it has been &s;pent with its cu&s;tomary happine&s;s. Parents will behold with plea&s;ure a new &s;ource of in&s;truction and entertainment for their children, from which they may them&s;elves &s;ometimes gather familiar and u&s;eful examples in what manner to rea&s;on with, and to treat them. The Aged, arrived at the oppo&s;ite period of our mortal career, and peculiarly &s;oothed by the &s;ociety of children, whether from the di&s;gu&s;t they are too apt to find in all other, or from an in&s;tinctive &s;elf-love, which urges them to &s;eek out beings yet more feeble than them&s;elves, upon whom to exerci&s;e what is left them of authority, will be gratified by finding the means of attaching them, by &s;uch dialogues and di&s;cour&s;es as will here be &s;et before them. And even Men of the World, hackneyed as they are in common pictures of life, may yet be open to &s;en&s;ations of plea&s;ure in &s;eeing a new portrait of manners, which, like tho&s;e of the pa&s;toral times, have the power of intere&s;ting univer&s;ally, by the charm: of Innocence and of Nature.</NOTE> The difference of their characters

and their pur&s;uits, while both are yet &s;o young, is not &s;ufficiently marked to require &s;eparate le&s;&s;ons. And the utmo&s;t attention has been paid to bringing them as often as po&s;&s;ible together, with a view to contribute towards in&s;piring that harmony and &s;ocial af|fection, which it is ever mo&s;t delightful to &s;ee between the children of the &s;ame parents.</P>
<P>It has been endeavoured to give all po&s;&s;ible variety to the &s;everal little Pieces which the volume contains. There is not one in the whole collection, which has not bad the trial of being read to &s;ome children of a more or le&s;s advanced age and under&s;tanding; and whatever was found deficient in engaging their attention, has either been altered or omitted.</P>
<P>Several little dramatic pieces are inter&s;per&s;ed thro' the work, of which children may perform the principal characters, with a view to give them, early in life, courage, grace, and ea&s;e in their addre&s;s, deportment, and conver&s;ation. The repre&s;entation of the&s;e drama<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> may be made a dome&s;tic fe&s;tival, while they contribute to their education. The parents, by performing a part in them, will enjoy the delightful &s;atisfaction of participating in the gaiety of their young family; and it may be con&s;idered as a new band to unite them &s;till more tenderly to each other, from an interchange of gratitude and plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Independent, however, of the moral purpo&s;es, which it is hoped this work may an&s;wer to children; the original will be found no le&s;s u&s;eful in early teaching them to &s;peak the French language with facility; while to the youthful &s;tudents of Engli&s;h in France, the tran&s;lation may prove of equal &s;ervice. Among the books which are generally given to them, the greater part are either above their comprehen&s;ion, or written with but little knowledge of their ideas and characters. But here, every &s;ubject that is pre&s;ented to them, will be of a &s;ort to excite their curio&s;ity, and intere&s;t their affecti|ons; and cannot, therefore, fail to familiari&s;e them to the phra&s;es natural, in both languages, to their age, and to tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ions which paint, with the greate&s;t &s;implicity, their de&s;ires, their wants, and their plea&s;ures.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE,</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY The TRANSLATOR.</BYLINE>
<P>THE work of Mr. Berquin, which is here pre&s;ented to the Engli&s;h reader, has been received in France with the flattering &s;ucce&s;s of univer&s;al approbation: and the edition which has been publi&s;hed in London, has already met with almo&s;t &s;imilar encou|ragement and honours. To transfu&s;e into the pre&s;ent ver&s;ion, either the &s;pirit or the elegance of the original, is beyond the hopes of the Tran&s;lator; who&s;e expectations will be an&s;wered, if it facilitates to our little &s;tudents of the French language, the reading and under&s;tanding the&s;e admirable <HI>Le&s;&s;ons of Amu&s;ement</HI>; and who&s;e utmo&s;t ambition, upon this &s;ubject, will be gratified, if it proves, at the &s;ame time, an a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the attainment of Engli&s;h, to the youthful pupils of our own tongue upon the continent.</P>
<P>With this view, the greate&s;t attention has been paid to pre|&s;erving the &s;en&s;e of the author, without adhering to the idiom of his language. The diction, therefore, will always be Engli&s;h, though the conver&s;ation to which it is the vehicle may be foreign. Some trifling circum&s;tances, al&s;o, have been nece&s;&s;arily changed, where the manners of the two Nations were too oppo&s;ite for a coalition.</P>
<P>The exclamation of <HI>Mon Dieu,</HI> &s;o common in France, to all ages, all occa&s;ions, and all ranks of people, would, in England, be extremely offen&s;ive in the mouths of children, except upon the mo&s;t &s;erious &s;ubjects, and when &s;poken with reverence and &s;upplication.</P>
<P>Nor was it po&s;&s;ible to tran&s;late literally the terms and actions of courte&s;y and good-breeding, among the children introduced in the dramas: for it appears, from the &s;pecimens which Mr. Bar|quin has given, that the cu&s;toms and opinions of our neighbours relating to juvenile politene&s;s, vary not le&s;s from our own, than their &s;entiments in religion and politics.</P>
<P>All however, that belongs to &s;tory, character, and &s;entiment, has been faithfully pre&s;erved. It were vain to make alterations, where there is no chance of improvement: and great, indeed, mu&s;t be the &s;kill that could add, in this little volume, to the intere&s;t excited by the &s;tory, the example impre&s;&s;ed by the cha|racter, or the moral enforced by the &s;entiment.</P>
<P>It will, however, perhaps, be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ething con|cerning the little dramas which are inter&s;per&s;ed through the work, le&s;t their de&s;ign &s;hould be cen&s;ured, from being ill under&s;tood.</P>
<P>That they may be &s;tudied, and even acted, with innocence, and improvement, in private hou&s;es, is the &s;ole view of their in|&s;ertion: but a public exhibition of them is by no means recom|mended;
<PB N="vi" REF="026643_0005_0FD1077144CB4798">
and all applau&s;e, even at excellence, ought in prudence to be with-held. Emulation might el&s;e be degraded into env<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and mode&s;t ea&s;e and courage might degenerate into boldne&s;s. It is the office of kindne&s;s to &s;till the pa&s;&s;ions, not to awaken or give birth to them: and this office would ill be performed by kindling, in the bo&s;oms of children, the dangerous flame of ambition; which, though capable of being turned to many ad|mirable purpo&s;es, incurs the danger, in the experiment, of leading to vanity and conceit. Piety and humility, forbearance and humanity, are the virtues here chiefly inculcated; for to tho&s;e they mu&s;t hereafter owe all that will be found mo&s;t laudable, amiable, and attractive, in their conduct, their di&s;po&s;ition, and their manners.</P>
<P>Neither is there the mo&s;t remote de&s;ire to cultivate theatrical talents: the&s;e little dramas are merely meant as a private &s;tudy of elocution, and an exerci&s;e for the memory; not as incitements to competition, nor promoters of vain-glory.</P>
<P>The great bu&s;ine&s;s of education, is to open and employ the various faculties of the under&s;tanding: and where the&s;e views are fulfilled, the &s;everal in&s;tructors of youth may be &s;everally contented: Not &s;o, however, their parents, their pre&s;ent friends, or their future connexions. Talents, &s;cience, and learning, however&punc; brilliant, important or profitable, mu&s;t &s;till, to tho&s;e with whom we live and a&s;&s;ociate, be &s;econdary con&s;iderations. The comforts of life cannot &s;pring from them, though they con|&s;titute its refinements: they will not make the character endear|ing, though they may render any commerce with it illu&s;trious. Dome&s;tic happine&s;s has its ba&s;is in the temper, and every &s;ocial virtue its origin in the heart. To form or to mend the&s;e, is the bu&s;ine&s;s, therefore, of the morali&s;t: and this, in the earlie&s;t &s;tages of reflexion and ob&s;ervation, is the le&s;&s;on and aim of every tale in this work.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions that &s;trike deep in the human mind, whe|ther frivolous or &s;erious, are rarely &s;ubdued, and &s;carce ever perhaps totally eradicated. Whatever, therefore, has any chance of fir&s;t catching their attention, &s;hould long merit their remem|brance; and to make what is &s;ub&s;ervient to their education, contribute to their amu&s;ement, is cheating idlene&s;s of futility, and alluring labour from in&s;truction.</P>

<HEAD>THE LITTLE BROTHER.</HEAD>
<P>LITTLE Fanny Greenland ro&s;e very early one morning, with a de&s;ign of gathering &s;ome flowers, and making them up into a no&s;e|gay for her mama. But, as &s;he was preparing to go down &s;tairs, her father came into the room, and taking her in his arms, &s;aid, with a &s;mile: Ki&s;s me, my dear Fanny, and come with me directly: I have &s;omething to &s;hew you that I am &s;ure you will like.</P>
<P>WHAT is it, papa? cried &s;he eagerly.</P>
<P>WHY God has made you a pre&s;ent to-night, he an&s;wered, of a little brother.</P>
<P>A little brother! O where is he? Pray let me &s;ee! Pray carry me to him!</P>
<P>MR. Greenland then opened the door of her mama's chamber. At the bed-&s;ide there was a woman, whom Fanny had never before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en in the hou&s;e, wrapping up the new-born baby in &s;waddling-clothes.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="026643_0007_0FD10775115D2120">THE little girl a&s;ked a thou&s;and and a thou|&s;and que&s;tions: Mr. Greenland an&s;wered them with the utmo&s;t goodne&s;s; and thought he had fully &s;atisfied her curio&s;ity, when &s;he called out: Papa, who is that old woman? How &s;he to&s;&s;es my little brother about! Are you not afraid &s;he will hurt him?</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Greenland.</SPEAKER>

<P>No, my love. God has given me milk on purpo&s;e that I may feed him with it. He is very weak now, but in a few days you will &s;ee &s;ome difference; and, in a few weeks, he will roll about the ground like a little lamb.</P>

<P>O THAT Winter would but la&s;t forever! cried little Frank, as he came home from &s;liding upon the ice, after amu&s;ing him&s;elf by making figures with the &s;now in the garden.</P>
<P>MR. Goodman his father, hearing this ex|clamation, called to him, and &s;aid: Frank, you will oblige me, by writing down that wi&s;h in my tablets. Frank in&s;tantly obeyed, though with a hand that was &s;haking with cold.</P>
<P>THE winter, however, &s;oon pa&s;&s;ed away, and the Spring &s;ucceeded it.</P>
<P>FRANK walked out one morning with his fa|ther, along a bank that was bordered with hya|cinths, auriculas, and narci&s;&s;u&s;es, and was almo&s;t tran&s;ported with delight, while he breathed their fragrance, and admired their fre&s;hne&s;s and beauty.</P>
<P>THESE, &s;aid Mr. Goodman, are the pro|ductions of &s;pring. They are brilliant, but they are very &s;hort-lived. O! an&s;wered Frank, that it was but always Spring!</P>
<P>WILL you write this wi&s;h in my tablets? &s;aid his father. Frank, jumping with high &s;pirits and joy, readily complied.</P>
<P>THE &s;pring, neverthele&s;s was &s;oon replaced by the Summer.</P>
<P>FRANK, one fine afternoon, went out with his father and mother, and &s;ome companions of his own age, to walk in a neighbouring village.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="026643_0014_0FD1078E5E8333F8">THEY ob&s;erved, as they proceeded, the mo&s;t beautiful variety of views and objects: now they admired the young green corn, waving lightly with the wind, like the &s;ea in its gentle&s;t motion; and now a meadow enameled with a thou&s;and flowers. Now they &s;aw little lambs fri&s;king and bounding on the hills; and now little chickens were playing gambols around the hen. They regaled them&s;elves with cherries, &s;trawberries, and other fruits of the &s;ea&s;on; and they pa&s;&s;ed the whole day in &s;porting in the fields.</P>
<P>DO you not find, Frank, &s;aid his father, when they were returning home, that &s;ummer hath its plea&s;ures?</P>
<P>O yes, an&s;wered Frank, how I wi&s;h it was to la&s;t the whole year!</P>
<P>THIS wi&s;h, al&s;o, at the de&s;ire of his father, he wrote in his tablets.</P>
<P>AT length came the Autumn.</P>
<P>ALL the family now went to &s;ee and enjoy the harve&s;t. It was not quite &s;o hot as in &s;um|mer; the air was &s;oft, and the &s;ky was &s;erene. The waggons were loading with rich &s;heaves of golden corn, the orchards were blooming with ripe plums and crim&s;on mulberries, and the branches of the apple-trees were bending with their fruit.</P>
<P>THIS was a day of fea&s;t and frolic to Frank, who loved nothing &s;o much as green-gages, and rich plums, and who was allowed the full en|joyment of gathering them him&s;elf.</P>

<HEAD>THE SNOW.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER many flattering, but deceitful promi&s;es, the &s;pring at length returned. The &s;oft-blowing wind again warmed the air, the &s;now was melted, the gra&s;s recovered its beautiful green, the flowers put forth their &s;weets, and the birds were every where heard &s;inging. Little Loui&s;a was already taken into the country by her father: and already &s;he had li&s;tened, with delight, to the ear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ongs of the cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h and the black-bird, and had gathered
<PB N="12" REF="026643_0017_0FD10798C90D13E0">
the fir&s;t budding violets; when, &s;uddenly and unexpectedly, the weather again changed. All at once, the wind ro&s;e in the North with vio|lence, it blew furiou&s;ly through the woods, and the ground was covered with &s;now. At night little Loui&s;a went &s;hivering to bed, yet returning thanks in her prayers to God, that he had giv|en her &s;o &s;afe a &s;helter from the injuries of the &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>THE next morning when &s;he got up, the flowers, the gra&s;s, the hedges, were all one white. There had been, during the night, &s;o great a fall of &s;now, that the pa&s;&s;engers, who were obliged to walk in it, found it up to their knees.</P>
<P>LOUISA was grieved at the &s;ight; but the little birds &s;eemed much more &s;o; for the &s;now lay &s;o deep upon the ground, that they could find neither grain nor worm, to appea&s;e their hunger.</P>
<P>ALL the little feathered inhabitants of the woods, now flew to the towns and the villages, to &s;eek for refuge and protection. Large flights of &s;parrows, linnets, chaffinches and larks, came into the yards and gardens, perched upon the roofs of the hou&s;es, and beat about, with their little bills and their feet, in every heap of rubbi&s;h they could find, in hopes of picking up &s;omething for food.</P>
<P>NEAR fifty of the&s;e little ramblers flew or dropt into the court-yard before Loui&s;a's hou&s;e. Loui&s;a &s;aw them, and, full of &s;orrow, went into her papa's room. What is the matter, my love? cried he. O papa, &s;he an&s;wered, tho&s;e poor little birds, that &s;ung &s;o prittily and
<PB N="13" REF="026643_0018_0FD1079B8F3908A0">
&s;o merrily only two days ago, are now all down there, in the court-yard. They are quite numb|ed with cold, and they have nothing to eat. May I go to the granary, papa, and take out &s;ome grain for them?</P>
<P>WITH all my heart, an&s;wered her father. Loui&s;a waited for nothing more. The granary was at &s;ome di&s;tance from the hou&s;e; but &s;he ha&s;tened to it with all &s;peed, followed by her governe&s;s, and eagerly filled her hands with corn and hemp-&s;eed, which &s;he ran and threw all over the court-yard. The birds now flew about her in great numbers, eagerly picking at the &s;malle&s;t little &s;eed. Loui&s;a &s;tood &s;ome time looking at them, and was overjoyed at the &s;ight. She then went to her father and mother, beg|ging them to come and look too, and take part in her joy.</P>
<P>BUT the&s;e little handfuls of grain were &s;oon devoured. The birds flew to the edges of the roof of the hou&s;e, and &s;orrowfully looking at Loui&s;a, &s;eemed to &s;ay: Have you nothing more to give us?</P>
<P>LOUISA under&s;tood their language; and, &s;wift as an arrow, &s;he ran in &s;earch of more grain. In her way &s;he met with a boy who was carrying in his hand a cage filled with birds&punc; but who had by no means &s;o compa&s;&s;ionate a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rt as Loui&s;a's; for he &s;hook the cage &s;o roughly, as he went along, that the poor little animals had their heads continually beat again&s;t the wire bars.</P>
<P>LOUISA &s;aw this with much concern. What are you going to do with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ds? cried &s;he to the boy.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="026643_0019_0FD1079EDA15D370">I don't know yet, an&s;wered he, but I &s;hall &s;ell them if I can; and if nobody will buy them, I &s;hall make a fea&s;t of them for my cat.</P>
<P>YOUR cat! cried Loui&s;a, your cat! O you wicked boy!</P>
<P>O, they won't be the fir&s;t, cried he, that &s;he has had to craunch alive between her teeth. And then, carele&s;sly &s;winging about the cage, he was walking off.</P>
<P>LOUISA &s;topt him, and a&s;ked how much he would have for them?</P>
<P>I will &s;ell them all at a farthing a piece, he an&s;wered, and there are eighteen of them.</P>
<P>VERY well, I'll take them of you, cried Loui&s;a; and bidding the boy follow her, &s;he hurried to her father, and begged his permi&s;&s;ion to make the purcha&s;e.</P>
<P>HER father readily con&s;ented, and even gave her the u&s;e of an empty room to keep them in.</P>
<P>THE boy, well &s;atisfied with his bargain, then went away; and told all his comrades that he knew a young lady who bought people's birds.</P>
<P>IN a few hours, there came &s;o many other boys, with more of the&s;e little animals, to the court-yard before Loui&s;a's hou&s;e, that the place &s;eemed turned into a bird-market. They all pre&s;&s;ed about her when &s;he came in &s;ight, jump|ing one above the other, and lifting their cages up with both their hands, each trying to re|commend to her the birds belonging to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>LOUISA bought all that were offered to her, and carried them into the room where &s;he had placed the others.</P>
<P>SHE did not leave them till night; but never had &s;he gone to bed &s;o plea&s;ed and delighted
<PB N="15" REF="026643_0020_0FD107ACAD28C2B0">
before. How happy I am, cried &s;he, to have &s;aved the lives of &s;o many innocent little crea|tures, and now to have the feeding of them my&s;elf! When &s;ummer comes, I will go into all the fields and woods; and then my little gue&s;ts &s;hall &s;ing me their prettie&s;t &s;ongs, to thank me for all this care I have taken of them.</P>
<P>SHE clo&s;ed her eyes with this thought, and dreamt that &s;he was &s;trolling in a very beautiful fore&s;t, where every tree was peopled with birds, hopping from branch to branch, and gaily warbling, or feeding their young: and Loui&s;a at the &s;ight &s;miled in her &s;leep.</P>
<P>SHE ro&s;e very early, to get food for her little vi&s;itors, both in her room and in the court-yard: but &s;he was not quite &s;o happy to-day, as &s;he had been the night before. She knew what money &s;he had had in her pur&s;e, and that but little could now remain. If this &s;nowy weather la&s;ts &s;ome days longer, cried &s;he, what will become of all the re&s;t of the birds? The wicked boys here will be giving the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll alive to be eat up by their cats; and for want of a little more money, I &s;hall not be able to &s;ave them.</P>
<P>WITH the&s;e melancholy thoughts, &s;he &s;lowly drew out her pur&s;e, to count over the little trea|&s;ure that was left.</P>
<P>BUT what was her amazement to feel it quite heavy! She opened it, and found it full of coins of different value, mixed and heaped together.</P>
<P>SHE flew to her father, and, in a tran&s;port of &s;urpri&s;e and joy, related what had happened to her.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="026643_0021_0FD107ACB0E75150">HER father took her to his bo&s;om, and, while he embraced her, wetted her cheeks with his tears.</P>
<P>MY deare&s;t child, cried he, thou ha&s;t never given me &s;o much &s;atisfaction as at this moment. Continue &s;till to a&s;&s;i&s;t all the little &s;uffering crea|tures that are in your power, and as fa&s;t as your pur&s;e is emptied, you &s;hall again &s;ee it filled.</P>
<P>WHAT joy was this for Loui&s;a! She ran in|to her birds apartment, with her apron full of hemp-&s;eed and corn. The birds all flew to her, with eyes that &s;hewed their eagerne&s;s for their breakfa&s;ts. She then went down into the court-yard, where &s;he gave another plentiful repa&s;t to her hungry vi&s;itors.</P>
<P>SHE now &s;aw that &s;he had near an hundred pen&s;ioners to nouri&s;h. What plea&s;ure, what rapture to her was this!</P>
<P>NEVER had her dolls or her play-things af|forded her &s;uch delight.</P>
<P>IN the afternoon, as &s;he put her hand into her bag of &s;eeds, &s;he found a little &s;lip of paper, containing the&s;e words: "The inhabitants of the air fly towards thee, O Lord! and thou give&s;t them nouri&s;hment: Thou putte&s;t forth thy hand, and poure&s;t down thy ble&s;&s;ings upon every thing that has life."</P>
<P>SHE eagerly turned to her father, who had followed her, and exclaimed: I, then, papa, am now like God; for the inhabitants of the air fly towards me, and when I put forth my hand, I pour down ble&s;&s;ings upon them.</P>
<P>YES, my child, &s;aid her father, every time you do good to any living creature, you are
<PB N="17" REF="026643_0022_0FD107AFD99A13C0">
like God. When you are grown up, you may &s;uccour your fellow-creatures, as you now &s;uc|cour the&s;e little birds: and then you will re&s;em|ble God much more. What happine&s;s for a human being to be able to do any thing like God!</P>
<P>DURING a week after this time, Loui&s;a con|tinued to <HI>put forth her hand, and pour down ble&s;&s;ings</HI> upon all the little hungry animals that &s;urrounded her. At length the &s;now melted; the fields recovered their verdure; and the birds, which had not dared venture from the hou&s;e|tops, now &s;pread their wings towards the woods.</P>
<P>BUT tho&s;e which were in her bird-apartment, were &s;till her gue&s;ts. At the return of the &s;un, they flew to the windows, and beat their little wings and bills again&s;t the gla&s;s; but all in vain: their pri&s;on was too &s;trong for their re&s;i&s;t|ance; and Loui&s;a had no idea of their mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>ONE day, when &s;he was carrying them &s;ome food, her father came into the room; and Loui&s;a was delighted to make him the &s;pectator of her amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>BUT, my dear Loui&s;a, cried he, why do the&s;e birds look &s;o re&s;tle&s;s and unea&s;y? They &s;eem to want &s;omething. Perhaps they have left in the fields and woods, &s;ome companions they wi&s;h to &s;ee again.</P>
<P>VERY true, papa; perhaps they have; for they have looked quite unhappy ever &s;ince the fine weather. I'll go and open the window, and let them fly away.</P>
<P>I think you will do quite right, an&s;wered her father, for you will make a general joy through|out the country. The&s;e little pri&s;oners will go
<PB N="18" REF="026643_0023_0FD107B20CFDCE40">
and find their companions again; and they will fly before them, ju&s;t as you run before me, when I have been ab&s;ent a few days, and come home.</P>
<P>ALL the windows were already open when he had fini&s;hed &s;peaking. The birds in&s;tantly perceived it, and, in a minute, not one remain|ed in the room. Some of them gra&s;ed the earth with their wings; others mounted upwards to|wards the &s;ky&punc; &s;ome perched upon the adjoin|ing trees; and others flew backwards and for|wards before the windows, &s;inging and chirping, and rejoicing in the plea&s;ure of their re&s;tored liberty.</P>
<P>LOUISA walked out in the country every day during &s;ummer, and, on each &s;ide, as &s;he turned, always heard or &s;aw &s;ome birds. Now the early lark took its flight from her feet, and &s;ung his joyful &s;ong in a&s;cending to the clouds: and now the chaffinch twittered hers, as &s;he perched upon the tops of the bu&s;hes: and when any one di&s;tingui&s;hed i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;elf by warbling with unu&s;ual &s;weetne&s;s, Loui&s;a &s;aid to her&s;elf: O!

neverthele&s;s &s;upported by his indu&s;try, till there came &s;o bad a &s;ea&s;on, that the price of corn was rai&s;ed, and bread was &s;old dearer than ever. The good man worked day and night; yet, in &s;pite of his utmo&s;t diligence, he could not earn money enough to buy even the wor&s;t and cheap|e&s;t food for &s;o many poor hungry children. He was &s;oon therefore reduced to the utmo&s;t mi&s;e|ry. One day he called about him all his family, and, with tears in his eyes, &s;aid to them: My &s;weet little ones, every thing is grown &s;o dear, that with all my working I cannot get enough for your &s;ub&s;i&s;tence: this mor&s;el of bread, that I now &s;hew you, co&s;ts me all the money that I can earn in the whole day. You mu&s;t content your&s;elves, therefore, to &s;hare with me the little I am able to get: and though it will not be enough to &s;atisfy you, it will &s;erve to prevent your dying quite &s;tarved.

His children all cried too; and every one &s;aid to him&s;elf: O good God! come to our help, poor little mi&s;erable things that we are! help to our poor father, and leave us not to die for hunger!</P>
<P>BENNET then divided his loaf into &s;even equal parts; he kept a &s;hare for him&s;elf, and gave the re&s;t among his children. One of them, however, who&s;e name was Andrew, re|fu&s;ed his portion, &s;aying: I am ill, father, and I can take nothing; &s;o pray eat my &s;hare your|&s;elf, or el&s;e part it among the others. My poor dear child, what is it ails you? cried Bennet, taking him in his arms. I am ill, an&s;wered Andrew, very ill, father, I will go and lie down.

<P>Oh! no, no, Sir! for God's &s;ake don't do that! I would rather tell you every thing! But fir&s;t, pray &s;end my brothers and &s;i&s;ters out of the room.</P>
</SP>
<P>THE phy&s;ician then bid all the chrildren go; and the little Andrew &s;aid: Oh, Sir! in the&s;e hard times, my father can but ju&s;t get enough to buy a coar&s;e brown loaf; and he &s;hares it among us all; and every one can have but a little mor&s;el; and for all that he hardly keeps any for him&s;elf. But it makes me very &s;orrow|ful to &s;ee my poor little brothers, and my poor little &s;i&s;ters, all &s;o hungry. And I am the elde&s;t, and I am &s;tronger than they are; &s;o I had rather go without my&s;elf, than eat any of it from them. And this is the rea&s;on I made believe I was ill: but pray, Sir, don't tell my father, for it will only fret him.</P>
<P>THE phy&s;ician, wiping his eyes, &s;aid: But you too, my good boy, are you not hungry your&s;elf?</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Andrew.</SPEAKER>
<P>O yes, indeed, I am very hungry too; only that does not vex me &s;o badly as &s;eeing them &s;o.</P>

<P>But you mu&s;t &s;oon die your|&s;elf, if you will take no nouri&s;hment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Andrew.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know it very well, Sir, but I &s;hall die with a very good heart; for my father will have one mouth le&s;s to fill: and when I go to God almighty, I &s;hall beg him very hard to give my poor little brothers and &s;i&s;ters &s;ome|thing to eat.</P>
</SP>
<P>THE worthy phy&s;ician felt the utmo&s;t tender|ne&s;s and admiration as he li&s;tened to the &s;enti|ments of this generous child. He took him in
<PB N="22" REF="026643_0027_0FD107C25D449590">
his arms, pre&s;&s;ed him to his bo&s;om, and &s;aid to him: No, my excellent little lad, thou &s;halt not die; God, the father of us all, will take care of thee, and of all thy family. Give thanks to him, that he has &s;ent me to your a&s;|&s;i&s;tance: I &s;hall return to you pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>HE then ha&s;tened to his own hou&s;e, and load|ing one of his &s;ervants with all &s;orts of provi&s;i|ons, he bid him attend him back to Andrew and his half-&s;tarved little brothers and &s;i&s;ters. He made them all &s;it down at a table, and de&s;ired them to eat till every one was fully &s;atisfied. It was a &s;cene of true delight to this good phy&s;ician, to witne&s;s the happine&s;s of the&s;e innocent creatures; and when he went away, he charged Andrew to &s;uffer no further unea&s;ine&s;s, promi&s;ing to &s;upply them him&s;elf with all nece&s;&s;aries.</P>
<P>HE faithfully kept his word, &s;ending them every day food in great plenty: and many other good and charitable per&s;ons, to whom he told this adventure, imitated his benevolence. Some gave them provi&s;ions, others money, and others linen and clothes; &s;o that, in a very &s;hort time, they had even more of every thing than they required.</P>
<P>NO &s;ooner was Bennet's landlord, who was a nobleman of exten&s;ive fortune and intere&s;t, informed of what the courageous little Andrew had &s;uffered for the &s;ake of his father, and his brothers and &s;i&s;ters, than, &s;truck with admira|tion at &s;uch genero&s;ity and fortitude, he &s;ent for the poor man, and &s;aid to him: You have a mo&s;t wonderful &s;on; and I will my&s;elf, al&s;o, be a father to him. I will &s;ettle you upon my own e&s;tate; and the re&s;t of your children &s;hall be

educated to whatever trade they them&s;elves chu&s;e, and at my expence: and if they improve as they ought, I will take care to have them all provided for.</P>
<P>BENNET returned home almo&s;t wild with joy; and, throwing him&s;elf upon his knees, gave thanks to heaven, for having ble&s;t him with &s;o excellent a child.</P>

<P>MRS. P. . . ., a lady as much di&s;tin|gui&s;hed for elegance of manners, and quickne&s;s of parts, as for the delicacy of her &s;entiments, and the dignity of her character, one day gently reproved Pri&s;cilla, her elde&s;t daughter, for &s;ome little giddine&s;s, which, though proper for correction, was yet very pardonable at her early age.

So I had not counted it out my&s;elf, &s;o I thought I would count it now. So I puts my fiddle on the ground, clo&s;e by my &s;ide, and I takes out the pocket handkerchief. See, &s;ays I, I have got this into the bargain; one of the Mi&s;&s;es gave it me. So I had put all my money in it: but when I was going to untie the knot, he catched at it. So then I gue&s;&s;ed at his &s;pite: he pulled it to him, and I pulled it to me; when, all of a &s;udden, he &s;aw my fiddle lying upon the ground, and plump he &s;at both his feet upon it! I let go my hold, in my fright; and then he pluck'd at the handkerchief, and runs off with it. My fiddle and bow are both broken; and I have neither my pocket-handkerchief nor my money! O my daddy! my poor daddy! what &s;hall we both do now?</P>

<P>CANARY-birds to &s;ell! who'll buy Canary-birds? choice, fine Canary-birds! cried a voice that was pa&s;&s;ing by the hou&s;e where Jami|ma lived. Jamima heard it, and running to the window, looked into every part of the &s;treet. She then &s;aw a man carrying upon his head a great cage filled with Canary-birds. They hopped &s;o lightly from perch to perch, and warbled &s;o &s;weet|ly, that Jamima, in the eagerne&s;s of her curio&s;ity, almo&s;t threw her&s;elf out of the window, in order to &s;ee them yet nearer.</P>
<P>MISS, &s;aid the man, will you buy a Cana|ry-bird?</P>
<P>I will, if I may, an&s;wered Jamima; but I mu&s;t not of my own accord: if you'll wait a little, I'll run and a&s;k leave of papa.</P>
<P>THE man readily agreed to wait; and &s;eeing a large po&s;t at the other end of the &s;treet, he went thither, and re&s;ted his cage upon it. Ja|mima, in the mean time, ran to her father's room, and, quite out of breath, called out: papa! papa! pray come to the window! pray come directly!</P>

<P>I, papa!&mdash;I let him die of hunger or thir&s;t! O no, indeed. I will never touch a mor&s;el of breakfa&s;t my&s;elf, till I have fed him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Godfrey.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Jamima, Jamima, how giddy are you! And one &s;ingle day's forget|fulne&s;s will kill him!</P>
</SP>
<P>JAMIMA, however, gave &s;uch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ir promi&s;es to her father; &s;he pleaded, entreated, hung by the &s;kirt of his coat, and begged his con&s;ent with &s;o much earne&s;tne&s;s, that Mr. Godfrey, at length, could no longer refu&s;e it.</P>
<P>HE then took her hand and led her into the &s;treet. They &s;oon came up to the man, and cho&s;e the mo&s;t beautiful bird that was in his cage: his feathers were of the brighte&s;t yellow, and he had a little black cre&s;t on the top of his head.</P>
<P>WHO, now, was &s;o happy as Jamima? She gave her pur&s;e to her papa, that he might pay for it; and he then took money from his own,
<PB N="59" REF="026643_0064_0FD10824A63F3E98">
to buy a very hand&s;ome cage, with two pretty drawers to hold &s;eed, and a water-gla&s;s of cry&s;tal.</P>
<P>NO &s;ooner had Jamima fixed her new favour|ite in its little palace, than &s;he flew all over the hou&s;e, calling her mama, her &s;i&s;ters, and even all the &s;ervants, to &s;hew them the bird which her papa had permitted her to buy. When any of her young friends came to &s;ee her, the fir&s;t words &s;he &s;aid to them, were always: Do you know I have got the prettie&s;t Canary-bird in the whole world? he is as yellow as gold, and he has a black tuft upon his head, ju&s;t like the feathers in mama's hat. But come, and you &s;hall &s;ee it: his name is Darling. I chri&s;tened him my&s;elf.</P>
<P>DARLING, thus highly in favour, fared ex|tremely well under the care of Jamima. The moment &s;he ro&s;e every morning, her fir&s;t thought was to procure him fre&s;h &s;eed, and the cleare&s;t water. Whenever there were any cakes or bi&s;cuits at her father's table, Darling had his &s;hare fir&s;t. She had always &s;ome little bits of &s;ugar in re&s;erve for him: and his cage was gar|ni&s;hed all round with chick-weed, and various good little things.</P>
<P>DARLING was not ungrateful for her atten|tions: he &s;oon learnt to di&s;tingui&s;h Jamima from the re&s;t of the family; and the in&s;tant he heard her foot&s;tep, he fluttered his little wings, and chirped without cea&s;ing. Jamima almo&s;t eat him up with ki&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>IN about a week, he began to &s;ing, and his &s;ong was the prettie&s;t in the world. Sometimes he would warble his wild notes &s;o long, that
<PB N="60" REF="026643_0065_0FD1082611FAFB48">
&s;he feared he mu&s;t have died with fatigue in the middle of his little air; then, after a few mo|ments re&s;t, he would begin again, more &s;weetly than ever, and with &s;o clear and brilliant a tone, that he was heard all over the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>JAMIMA, &s;eated by the &s;ide of his cage, &s;pent whole hours in li&s;tening to him. Her work was frequently thrown a&s;ide, that nothing might interrupt her looking at him: and when he had delighted her with one of his little &s;ongs, &s;he entertained him, in her turn, with an air upon the bird-organ, which he pre&s;ently &s;trove to imitate.</P>
<P>BY degrees, however, the&s;e plea&s;ures became familiar, and lo&s;t their power of charming. Her father one day made her a pre&s;ent of a book of prints; and &s;he was &s;o much taken up with admiring them, that Darling was neglected. Still he fluttered his little wings, and chirped, the in&s;tant he &s;aw Jamima; but Jamima no longer heard him.</P>
<P>NEAR a week now pa&s;&s;ed, and Darling had neither fre&s;h chick-weed, nor bi&s;cuit. He &s;ung the prettie&s;t little &s;ongs that Jamima had taught him; he even compo&s;ed new ones for her him|&s;elf; but all in vain: Jamima had other things in her head.</P>
<P>IT was now her birth-day; and her godfather pre&s;ented her with a great jointed doll. This doll, which &s;he called Colombine, completed the downfall of Darling. From the time &s;he ro&s;e, to the hour of going to bed, &s;he had no thought, and no employment, but to dre&s;s and undre&s;s, again and again, this dumb little Co|lombine; to talk to her, to call her by her
<PB N="61" REF="026643_0066_0FD10828E321CA28">
name, and to carry her in her arms up and down the room. The poor bird was now well enough off, if, towards the evening, &s;he remem|bered to give him a little food.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES, however, he had to wait for it till the next morning.</P>
<P>AT length, one day when they were at table, Mr. Godfrey accidentally turning his eyes to|wards the cage, &s;aw the Canary-bird lying upon its &s;tomach, and panting with great difficulty. His feathers almo&s;t &s;tood an end, and he looked as round as a ball. Mr. Godfrey went up to him: but no chirping! no fluttering of his wings! the poor little animal had hardly &s;trength even to draw its breath.</P>
<P>JAMIMA! cried Mr. Godfrey, with much di&s;plea&s;ure, what is the matter with your bird? Jamima, colouring, &s;tammered out: Why, papa, it's&mdash;the thing is&mdash;why, I happened to forget&mdash;And, trembling and a&s;hamed, &s;he ran for the box of &s;eed.</P>
<P>MR. Godfrey took down the cage, and ex|amined the drawers, and the water-gla&s;s. Alas! poor Darling had not one drop of water, nor one &s;ingle &s;eed!</P>
<P>O poor little bird! cried Mr. Godfrey, into what cruel hands have you fallen! If I had but fore&s;een it, you &s;hould never have been bought. All the company then ro&s;e, and approached the cage, lifting up their hands with a look of pity, and calling out: O poor little bird!</P>
<P>MR. Godfrey put &s;ome &s;eed into both the drawers, and filled the gla&s;s with fre&s;h water: and at length, though with much difficulty, Darling was brought back to life.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="026643_0067_0FD10829CEB1BFD0">JAMIMA, crying, left the table, and running up to her own chamber, pa&s;&s;ed the re&s;t of the day in tears.</P>
<P>THE next morning, Mr. Godfrey gave or|ders that the bird &s;hould be carried out of the hou&s;e, and given to the &s;on of Mr. Mer&s;ey, one of his neighbours, who had the character of being a very careful boy, and who, he hoped, would not forget him, as Jamima had done.</P>
<P>THE &s;orrow and repentance of the little girl grew now more and more violent. O my dear little bird! &s;he cried, my poor &s;weet Darling! &mdash;O papa! dear, dear papa! indeed I will never forget him again; indeed, indeed, I promi&s;e you I will not. Only let me have him this once! this one &s;ingle time is all I beg!</P>
<P>MR. Godfrey at length, moved by her en|treaties, re&s;tored to her the Canary-bird; not, however, without a &s;evere reproof for her pa&s;t negligence, and a mo&s;t earne&s;t charge that &s;he would be more attentive for the future. This poor little animal, &s;aid he, is &s;hut up in a cage, and has therefore no power to provide for its own wants. If <HI>you</HI> want any thing, you can at lea&s;t a&s;k for it; but this poor little bird can make nobody under&s;tand his language. If ever again you make him &s;uffer, either from hunger or thir&s;t&mdash;</P>
<P>AT the&s;e w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ds a &s;hower of tears trickled down the cheeks of Jamima. She took her papa's hand, and ki&s;&s;ed it, but her &s;hame and &s;orrow prevented her &s;peaking.</P>
<P>JAMIMA was now once more the mi&s;tre&s;s of Darling; and Darling was ea&s;ily and cordially reconciled with Jamima.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="026643_0068_0FD1082C2FE57598">ABOUT a month after, Mr. Godfrey and his lady were obliged to make a journey of a few days into the country. My dear Jamima, &s;aid he, in taking leave, be very &s;ure you never for|get the little Canary-bird.</P>
<P>O no, papa! cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed &s;he; and &s;carcely were they &s;eated in the carriage, before &s;he flew to the cage, and made it her fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;ee that the bird &s;hould have every thing it could po&s;&s;ibly require.</P>
<P>IN an hour or two, however, &s;he began to grow tired; &s;he &s;ent for &s;ome of her little friends to vi&s;it her, and her gaiety returned. They all walked out together, and when they came back, they &s;pent the fir&s;t part of the evening in playing Blind-man's-buff, and Pu&s;s-in-the-corner; and then they diverted them&s;elves with dancing. It was very late when the little party broke up, and Jamima went to bed quite wearied and fatigued.</P>
<P>THE next morning &s;he awoke almo&s;t at the break of day, and could think of nothing but her la&s;t night's amu&s;ements. If her governe&s;s would have given her leave, &s;he would have flown the very moment &s;he was dre&s;&s;ed, to re|turn the vi&s;it of her young friends: but it was nece&s;&s;ary to wait till the afternoon. Scarcely, however, had &s;he patience to fini&s;h her dinner, before &s;he de&s;ired to be taken to them.</P>
<P>AND what became of Darling? He was obliged to &s;tay at home alone, and to fa&s;t!</P>
<P>THE next day, al&s;o, was &s;pent in nothing but amu&s;ements.</P>
<P>AND Darling?&mdash;He was forgotten again!</P>
<P>THE third day it was &s;till the &s;ame.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="026643_0069_0FD1082D989749C0">AND Darling?&mdash;Why, who would think of him in the mid&s;t of &s;uch diver&s;ions?</P>
<P>THE fourth day Mr and Mrs. Godfrey came home from their journey Jamima had thought but little about their return: but her father had no &s;ooner embraced her, and enqui|red after her health, than he &s;aid: And how is Darling?</P>
<P>O, very well, an&s;wered Jamima, a little &s;ur|pri&s;ed, and running to the cage for the bird.</P>
<P>ALAS! the poor little animal was no more! it was lying upon its back, its wings &s;tretched out, and its beak open.</P>
<P>JAMIMA wrung her hands, and &s;cream|ed aloud. Every body ran to her, and &s;aw what had happened.</P>
<P>POOR little haple&s;s animal! cried Mr. God|frey, how painful has been thy death! Had I but my&s;elf de&s;troyed thee on the day of my departure, thy &s;ufferings would at lea&s;t have been but for a moment; while now, for &s;o many days, thou ha&s;t borne all the pangs of hunger and thir&s;t, and thy death has been at|tended with the mo&s;t cruel and lingering pains. Thou art happy, however, to be at length de|livered from the hands of &s;o pitile&s;s a guardian.</P>
<P>JAMIMA wi&s;hed to hide her&s;elf in the bow|els of the earth: &s;he would willingly have given up all her play-things, and all her pocket-money, to have re&s;tored Darling to life: but all was now too late!</P>
<P>MR. Godfrey took the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rd, and gave orders to have it &s;tuffed, and then hung it up in the &s;aloon.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="026643_0070_0FD1082FE3E8F670">JAMIMA did not dare look at it: or if, by any accident, it caught her eyes, they were in|&s;tantly filled with tears: and &s;he humbly and earne&s;tly be&s;ought her rather to have it removed from her &s;ight.</P>
<P>MR. Godfrey, after many entreaties, at length con&s;ented: but every time &s;he was guilty of any fault or folly, the bird was again put in its place; and &s;he heard the whole family exclaiming: Poor unfortunate animal! how cruel a death ha&s;t thou &s;uffered!</P>

<P>A third time they &s;eparated, and with more pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vi&s;hne&s;s and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ger than ever. Leander brought back his whip; Julia again took her doll; but the whip no longer &s;ounded to his mind, and every thing went wrong at the doll's toilette. Leander &s;ighed; Julia wept. At length the dinner-bell rang, and Mr. Dartrey him&s;elf made enquiries if they were ready to come to the table. But what, cried he, &s;eeing them both &s;o &s;ad, what is the matter with you?</P>
<P>NOTHING at all, papa, an&s;wered the children; and drying their eyes, they followed their father into the dining parlour.</P>
<P>THEY had, this day, a variety of di&s;hes upon the table, and each a bottle of wine upon the &s;ide-board.</P>
<P>MY dear children, &s;aid Mr. Dartrey, had I &s;till any authority over you, I &s;hould forbid you ta&s;ting all the&s;e di&s;hes, and &s;till more your drink|ing any wine: or, at lea&s;t, I &s;hould help you to very little, from my knowledge of the danger of wine and &s;pices to children. But you are now your own managers, and mu&s;t eat and drink according to your di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>THE children waited not to be told this twice: one &s;wallowed great mouthfuls of meat without bread, the other took the gravy and &s;auce in large &s;poonfuls; and both of them poured out full bumpers of wine, without thinking of mix|ing it with water.</P>
<P>BUT, my dear, &s;aid Mrs. Dartrey, in a whi&s;per to her hu&s;band, they will make them|&s;elves quite ill.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="026643_0076_0FD1083B5E6900F0">I fear &s;o too, replied Mr. Dartrey; yet I would rather they &s;hould learn, even at their own ex|pen&s;e, for once, the mi&s;chief of ignorance, than, by too much attention to their health, deprive them of &s;o important a le&s;&s;on.</P>
<P>MRS. Dartrey, &s;eeing the de&s;ign of her hu&s;|band, would not interfere, but left the little &s;impletons to the enjoyment of their gluttony.</P>
<P>THEY now ro&s;e from table; the children having eat till they were too full to &s;wallow a mor&s;el more, and drank till their little heads began already to be heated.</P>
<P>COME along Julia, cried Leander; and he carried his &s;i&s;ter with him into the garden.</P>
<P>MR. Dartrey thought it nece&s;&s;ary to follow their foot&s;teps.</P>
<P>THERE was a &s;mall piece of water in the garden, and clo&s;e to its border a little boat. Leander had a fancy to get into it.</P>
<P>JULIA &s;topped him. You know very well cried &s;he, we are forbid going there. Forbid! replied he; have you forgot that we are to do ju&s;t what we like?</P>
<P>O, very true! cried Julia; and giving her hand to her brother, they both jumped into the boat.</P>
<P>MR. Dartrey now approached nearer, but did not yet think proper to di&s;cover him&s;elf. He knew the water was not very deep, and that, if they fell into it, he &s;hould not have much trouble in drawing them out again.</P>
<P>THE children endeavoured to loo&s;en the boat from the &s;ide, and pu&s;h it into the middle of the water; but they could not contrive to untie the knots of the cord with which it was fa&s;|tened.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="026643_0077_0FD1083DA6495888">WELL, if we can't &s;ail, cried the hair-brained Leander, we can at lea&s;t play at balancing. They then jumped backwards and forwards acro&s;s the boat, now making it lean on one &s;ide, now on the other.</P>
<P>THEIR heads being a little confu&s;ed, it was not long before their feet began to &s;tagger. Each caught hold of the other for a prop; but they both fell in&s;tantly upon the edge of the boat, and from the edge of the boat, <HI>plump,</HI> into the water.</P>
<P>MR. Dartrey, &s;wift as lightning, now flew from the place where he had been concealed. He flung him&s;elf into the water, &s;eized in each hand one of his daring little children, and car|ried them, half dead with terror, into the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>THEY were now very &s;ick, but in&s;tantly un|dre&s;&s;ed, and rubbed with flannel. They were then each put into a warm bed, where they lay &s;ucce&s;&s;ively in a &s;tate of extreme weakne&s;s, or in convul&s;ions. They had a mo&s;t dreadful head-ach, and a pain in the &s;tomach they could hardly endure. They fainted away &s;everal times; and every fainting was followed by ter|rible &s;ickne&s;s, and much difficulty of breathing.</P>
<P>IN this deplorable manner they pa&s;&s;ed the re&s;t of the day. They &s;hed tears in abundance; they &s;obbed aloud; till, at length, fatigued with &s;orrow and &s;uffering, they cried them&s;elves to &s;leep.</P>
<P>EARLY the next morning, their father came into the chamber, and de&s;ired to know how they had pa&s;&s;ed the night.</P>
<P>O, very ill, papa! cried they, both at once, and in a very feeble voice; we could hardly &s;leep at all, and we have the head-ach and the &s;tomach-ach &s;till.</P>

<HEAD>THE THORN-BUSHES.</HEAD>
<P>IN a very fine evening in the month of May, Mr. Dalton, &s;eated him&s;elf, with his &s;on Arthur, upon the &s;ide of a little hill; whence he taught him to view and admire the beauties of the pro&s;pect before him, which the &s;etting &s;un, in bidding adieu, &s;eemed to clothe in a robe of purple. They were a little di&s;turbed, however, from this plea&s;ing &s;tudy, by the loud &s;inging of a &s;hepherd, who was bringing back his bleating flock from the neighbouring mea|dow. At each &s;ide of the road he went along, there were bu&s;hes full of thorns, upon which every &s;heep that approached, left &s;ome part of its fleece.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="026643_0080_0FD10847E737D738">LITTLE Arthur, young and eager, was quick|ly in a pa&s;&s;ion with the&s;e robbers. See! &s;ee! papa, cried he, only look at tho&s;e na&s;ty thorns, that are &s;tealing the wool from the &s;heep! Why did God make tho&s;e wicked brambles? or why does not every body, of one accord, go and root them all up? If the poor &s;heep &s;hould come back again by the &s;ame way, they would leave all the re&s;t of their clothing with them. But no! I won't let them; for I will get up my&s;elf to-morrow morning, by break of day, and come with my little bill, and <HI>&s;nip, &s;nap,</HI> I will cut down every one of the thorn-bu&s;hes: and if you will come with me too, papa, and bring your great wood-knife, the bu&s;ine&s;s will all be done before breakfa&s;t.</P>
<P>WE will think of your &s;cheme replied Mr. Dalton; but, mean time, be not &s;o unju&s;t to tho&s;e thorns: recollect what happens in &s;heep-&s;hearing time.</P>

<P>Very true, papa; for then they wanted it for their clothes: but the&s;e thorns tear it off from mere ill-nature, and without wanting it at all.</P>

<P>You know not what purpo&s;e this may an&s;wer to them: but even &s;uppo&s;ing it to be of no u&s;e, is the want of a thing &s;uffi|cient rea&s;on for &s;eizing it?</P>

<P>ARTHUR, who thought him&s;elf already a hero, from the mere idea of de&s;troying, with his own little hand, this legion of robbers, could with difficulty &s;leep all night, &s;o full was his mind of his victories for the next morning: and &s;carce had the gay chirping of the birds, perched upon the trees near his windows, pro|claimed the return of Aurora, before he ha&s;ten|ed to awake his father; while Mr. Dalton, tho' little occupied with the de&s;truction of the thorns, yet charmed with an opportunity of &s;hewing to his &s;on the opening beauties of the ri&s;ing morn, was not le&s;s eager to quit his bed. They dre&s;&s;|ed them&s;elves with &s;peed, took up their arms, and &s;et out upon their expedition. Arthur, with an air of triumph, went fir&s;t, and Mr. Dalton was hardly able to keep pace with him. In approaching the thorns, they &s;aw that they were almo&s;t covered with little birds, hopping to and fro, and fluttering upon the branches.
<PB N="77" REF="026643_0082_0FD1084C892D7108">
Softly, &s;oftly! cried Mr. Dalton to his &s;on; let us defer, for a moment, our vengeance, le&s;t we &s;hould di&s;turb the&s;e pretty innocent creatures. We will go again to that part of the hill where we were &s;eated la&s;t night, and try to find out what it is that the&s;e little birds are &s;eeking in the bu&s;hes, with &s;o bu&s;y and occupied an air. They a&s;cended the hill, &s;at down, and looked on. They then perceived that the birds carried away in their bills tho&s;e very tufts of wool which the thorns had caught from the &s;heep the preceding evening; and that chaffinches, linnets, and nightingales, came in large num|bers to enrich them&s;elves with the &s;poil.</P>
<P>WHAT does this mean? cried Arthur, all a&s;toni&s;hed.</P>
<P>IT means, replied his father, that Providence takes care of the &s;malle&s;t creatures, and furni&s;hes them with all &s;orts of methods for their happi|ne&s;s and pre&s;ervation. You &s;ee here how the poor birds find <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ape&s;try for the habitations they build for their little ones; and how &s;oft and warm a bed they prepare for their young family. Thus tho&s;e hone&s;t thorn-bu&s;hes, with which but ye&s;terday you were &s;o ea&s;ily provoked, unite the inhabitants of the air with tho&s;e of the earth: they take from the rich what is more than they can u&s;e, to give to the poor what they ab&s;olute|ly need.

<P>O heaven forbid! exclaimed Arthur.</P>

<P>THERE was once a certain crazy man who&s;e name was Jo&s;eph, who never went out without putting five or &s;ix wigs, one piled above another, upon his head, and as many muffs upon each of his arms. But though his &s;en&s;es were di&s;ordered, he was not mi&s;chievous, nor ever, unle&s;s much teazed and provoked, in a pa&s;&s;ion. Yet he could not walk in the &s;treets, without being &s;urround|ed by a &s;et of idle and impertinent little boys, who always tormented and followed him, calling out: Here, Jo&s;eph, Jo&s;eph! What will you &s;ell your wigs for? what will you take for your muffs? Some of them were even wicked enough to throw &s;tones after him. Poor Jo&s;eph com|monly bore the&s;e in&s;ults with great patience; though at times, when pe&s;tered and vexed be|yond mea&s;ure, he would fall into a rage, and gather pebbles, or take up whole handfuls of mud, to fling at the unfeeling little fellows.</P>

<P>It &s;erved me to live upon for &s;ome years in the country, while I was yet expecting a &s;mall jointure, which I had flatter|ed my&s;elf I &s;hould obtain. But at length, when all my hopes were de&s;troyed, I re&s;olved upon returning to my former benefactre&s;s. Upon my arrival at her hou&s;e, I received intelligence that &s;he was dead: I had then no re&s;ource left, but in &s;elling all that I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of jewels and clothes, and &s;ub&s;i&s;ting by the work of my own hands. I retired to a &s;mall village, that I might live, at lea&s;t, unknown. And a &s;hort time ago, I ac|cidentally met a woman whom I had formerly been acquainted with, and who lived in this place.</P>

It is to her alone I am indebted for all the ho&s;pitality I have met with: and as &s;he has nobody belonging to her even to clo&s;e her eyes, &s;he has given me to under&s;tand that I &s;hall inherit what &s;he is worth at her death.

<P>I owed my life to him: what happine&s;s for me, then, to pay that obligation to his wife, and to his child! I &s;erved under him during the la&s;t war in Germany. In an unfortunate engagement, at a moment when I was ju&s;t &s;inking with fatigue, one of the enemy a&s;&s;ailed me; and his &s;word had already made an aim that mu&s;t have proved my de&s;truction, had not the worthy Lieutenant Colonel pre&s;erved me, by falling upon the enemy him&s;elf.</P>

<P>Some days after, I had the command given me of a &s;mall detachment, in a very hazardous expedition. We were &s;ur|rounded by the enemy, and after a long re&s;i&s;t|ance, forced to &s;urrender. My baggage had been plundered, and I was &s;tripped both of clothes and money. Colonel Jeffer&s;on, who was informed of my &s;ituation, immediately had me recommended to the enemy's General. I obtained, by his good offices, all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance that I required, in the treatment of a deep wound which I had received in the engagement. It was more than two years before I recovered.

When I returned to my native country, I had only time to once &s;ee and thank him, for I was obliged to embark immediately for the We&s;t-Indies. I had there the good fortune to marry extremely well; and about &s;ix years ago I came back to England. I meant to ha&s;ten to him, but I heard he was no more.

<HEAD>ARABELLA and PEGGY.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE the &s;un was ri&s;en above the hori|&s;on, to give light to the mo&s;t beautiful morning of the &s;pring, the young Arabella was already in her father's garden, intending to make her breakfa&s;t a greater regale to her, by fir&s;t &s;trolling up and down the long alleys. What|ever could add to the charms of the&s;e earlie&s;t hours of the day, &s;eemed now united to delight her. The purity and fre&s;hne&s;s of the air, gave a calm to all her &s;en&s;es. Her ta&s;te was gratified by the delicacy of the &s;weet-meats &s;he was eat|ing; her eye, by the &s;oft lu&s;tre of the new-born green; her &s;mell, by the &s;weet perfume of a thou&s;and flowers; and, le&s;t her ear alone &s;hould

remain un&s;oothed, two nightingales perched them&s;elves upon the &s;ummit of an arbour ju&s;t by, as if purpo&s;ely to rejoice her with their morning &s;ongs. Arabella was &s;o enchanted with the loveline&s;s of the &s;cene around her, that tears of plea&s;ure &s;tarted into her eyes, though they e&s;caped not down her cheeks. Her heart, beating with the &s;ofte&s;t feelings, was filled with tenderne&s;s and benevolence: when, all at once, her plea&s;ing thoughtfulne&s;s was interrupted by the &s;ound of the feet of a little girl, who was coming into the &s;ame alley, and devouring with great greedine&s;s a thick &s;lice of brown bread.</P>
<P>AS &s;he, al&s;o, was walking in the garden only to divert her&s;elf, &s;he looked all round her, with|out noticing any particular object, and advanced clo&s;e up to Arabella, without perceiving her. The moment &s;he &s;aw her, &s;he &s;topped &s;hort, and ca&s;t her eyes on the ground; and then, with the &s;wiftne&s;s of a terrified young deer, &s;he ha&s;tily turned back the &s;ame way &s;he came.</P>
<P>STOP, &s;top, cried Arabella, &s;tay for me, lit|tle girl, &s;tay for me! What do you run &s;o for? But the&s;e words only made the little ru&s;tic fly the quicker.</P>
<P>ARABELLA began to follow her; but being le&s;s practi&s;ed in &s;uch races, found it impo&s;&s;ible <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> overtake her. Fortunately, however, &s;he had run into a winding path, in order to get out of the garden; and the alley in which &s;he had e&s;caped from Arabella, led directly to the garden-gate. Arabella, who was no le&s;s &s;en&s;ible than pretty, crept, therefore, &s;oftly along the &s;ide of a thick hedge, which bordered the walk; and arrived at the la&s;t bu&s;h, at the very in&s;tant the

<P>SHE now &s;uddenly &s;eized her, calling out: Ah ha! you are my pri&s;oner! I have you &s;afe, you cannot run away any more.</P>
<P>THE little girl &s;truggled to get out of her hands. Don't be &s;o naughty, cried Arabella; if you knew the good I mean to do you, you would not be &s;o fierce. Come, there's a good girl, come with me for a little while.</P>
<P>THESE friendly words, and &s;till more the &s;oothing voice in which they were &s;poken, gave the little girl &s;ome courage, and &s;he followed Arabella into a &s;ummer-hou&s;e.</P>

<P>BUT what will be her joy, thought &s;he, when I give her two new ribbons, and a neck|lace?

<P>O, poor little Peggy, I dare &s;ay &s;he never &s;aw any in her life. If I was only to &s;hew her the&s;e long whi&s;kers, &s;he would be as frightened&mdash;O, how frightened &s;he would be! I think I &s;ee her now, running away with all her might. Mama, if you would give me leave, I &s;hould like va&s;tly to &s;ee what faces &s;he would make at them.

<P>No, my dear Arabella, Peggy has not made me angry at all: but do you mean, by the things you do for her, to make her hap|py or mi&s;erable?</P>

<P>Why, mama, now don't be angry, but ye&s;terday I had a mind to try.

till I had got together a little &s;um of money; and then I would employ it in buying for her whatever I found &s;he mo&s;t wanted. The things that &s;erve for clothes to the children of the poor, are not very expen&s;ive.</P>
</SP>
<P>ARABELLA followed her mama's advice. She called Peggy but &s;eldom to partake of her break|fa&s;t; but &s;he frequently made her other, and far more u&s;eful pre&s;ents. Sometimes &s;he gave her an apron, &s;ometimes a petticoat, and &s;ome|times a cap: and &s;he paid her&s;elf for her &s;chool|ing, that &s;he might be properly taught to read.</P>
<P>PEGGY was &s;o much delighted by the&s;e bene|factions, that &s;he every day attached her&s;elf more and more tenderly to Arabella. She would fre|quently run after her, to &s;ay: Have you any thing I can do for you, Mi&s;s Arabella? Can I go of any errand? And, whenever Arabella found her &s;ome employment, nothing could equal the joy with which Peggy ha&s;tened to oblige her.</P>
<P>SHE went one day to the garden-gate, to wait for Arabella's coming; but after &s;taying far beyond the u&s;ual time, Arabella appeared not. Peggy was forced to go home, but &s;oon returned to watch again; but again &s;he &s;aw no|thing of Arabella. Two days following, &s;he continued to come at the accu&s;tomed hours; but no Arabella was ready to receive her.</P>
<P>POOR Peggy was now in the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, that her benefactre&s;s &s;eemed thus to have for|&s;aken her.</P>
<P>AH! cried &s;he, does not &s;he love me any longer? May be I have made her angry without know|ing it. I am &s;ure if I could tell what it was,
<PB N="124" REF="026643_0129_0FD108D42E6522E0">
I would beg her pardon again and again; for I &s;hall die, now, if &s;he will not love me always!</P>
<P>AT this moment, Mrs. Alli&s;on's maid hap|pened to come out of the garden. Peggy ran after her. Pray tell me, cried &s;he, where Mi&s;s Arabella is?</P>
<P>MISS Arabella? &s;aid the maid, &s;he is very ill; &s;he has not perhaps, many hours to live. I think her quite at the la&s;t moment; &s;he has got the &s;mall-pox.</P>
<P>O good God! exclaimed Peggy, &s;he mu&s;t not die! I can't let her die!</P>
<P>SHE then flew into the hou&s;e, and ran up &s;tairs into Mrs. Alli&s;on's room. O good Lady, &s;he cried, for pity's &s;ake tell me where is Mi&s;s Arabella, and let me go to her!</P>
<P>MRS. Alli&s;on would have &s;topped her, but &s;he had &s;een, through the door, which was half open, Arabella's bed: and &s;he was already at its &s;ide.</P>
<P>ARABELLA was in all the re&s;tle&s;s pain of a violent fever. She was alone, and very melan|choly; for all her young friends had been taken from her.</P>
<P>PEGGY, crying bitterly, caught hold of her hand, pre&s;&s;ed it between her own, ki&s;&s;ed it a hundred times, and &s;aid: Ah! good God! what a way do I &s;ee you in! O, don't die, I beg you! What mu&s;t I do if I &s;hould lo&s;e you? I will &s;tay with you both day and night; I will watch over you, and wait upon you.&mdash;May I, Mi&s;s Arabella? will you let me?</P>
<P>ARABELLA pre&s;&s;ed her hand, and ea&s;ily made her under&s;tand that &s;he con&s;ented with plea&s;ure to her offer.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="026643_0130_0FD108E076251198">PEGGY now, with the permi&s;&s;ion of Mrs. Alli&s;on, became the con&s;tant attendant of Ara|bella; and whatever &s;he was &s;uffered to do for her, &s;he was careful &s;hould be done as well as po&s;&s;ible. They made up a bed for her upon the floor, by the &s;ide of the little invalid; and &s;he never for an in&s;tant quitted her. When Arabella only made the &s;lighte&s;t murmur, Peg|gy jumped up to enquire what was the matter. She gave her all her phy&s;ic her&s;elf. Sometimes &s;he gathered ru&s;hes, in order to amu&s;e her by &s;hewing her how &s;he could make pretty ba&s;kets; at other times, &s;he hunted over Mrs. Alli&s;on's library, to find out prints for her to look at. Her mind was always employed in thinking of &s;omething to entertain her, and make her for|get her &s;ufferings. During one week of the time, Arabella lo&s;t her eye-&s;ight by her di&s;order; and this week &s;eemed very long indeed: yet Peggy a&s;&s;i&s;ted her to bear it, by diverting her with the hi&s;tory of all the village; and, as &s;he had improved very much by her le&s;&s;ons of read|ing, &s;he picked out for her all the books &s;he thought &s;he would like to hear; and frequently, in a very tender manner, &s;he would endeavour to give her comfort: Only have a little patience, &s;he would &s;ay, and God will take pity on you, as you u&s;ed to take pity on me. At this re|membrance, &s;he would cry; but, &s;oon drying her eyes, &s;ay more chearfully: Come, Mi&s;s Arabella, &s;hall I &s;ing you a pretty &s;ong to divert you? Arabella had but to give a nod, and Peg|gy immediately &s;ung to her all the little &s;ongs &s;he had learnt from the &s;hepherds' boys in the neighborhood. And thus the time pa&s;&s;ed away, and Arabella hardly ever was tired.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="026643_0131_0FD108E55FBE05B8">AT length, though by &s;low degrees, her health was perfectly re-e&s;tabli&s;hed. Her eyes again opened, her &s;trength returned, her complexion lo&s;t its redne&s;s, and her appetite was re&s;tored.</P>
<P>HER face, however, was &s;till marked with her late di&s;order. But Peggy only looked at her with the greate&s;t plea&s;ure, from thinking of the danger &s;he had been in of lo&s;ing her. Nei|ther could Arabella, in return, ever &s;ee her without tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>HOW can I pay you as I wi&s;h to do, cried &s;he, for all that you have done for me? She then applied to her mama, to know in what manner &s;he could po&s;&s;ibly reward her con&s;tant and faithful little nur&s;e. Mrs. Alli&s;on, who almo&s;t lo&s;t her &s;en&s;es with the exce&s;s of her joy, in &s;eeing her beloved daughter re&s;tored to life, after &s;o dangerous an illne&s;s, an&s;wered: Leave that to me; I will take care that &s;he &s;hall be properly recompen&s;ed for what we both owe to her diligence and fondne&s;s.</P>
<P>SHE then gave orders to have a complete dre&s;s made for Peggy, including one thing of every &s;ort that &s;he could wear. Arabella undertook to equip her in it her&s;elf, the fir&s;t day that &s;he &s;hould be thought well enough to go again into the garden. This day proved a fe&s;tival to the whole hou&s;e. Not only Mrs. Alli&s;on, but all the dome&s;tics, were tran&s;ported with joy to &s;ee Arabella again down &s;tairs; while Arabella was equally delighted, from the plea&s;ure of having &s;o u&s;eful a pre&s;ent for her good Peggy. Peggy her&s;elf was half crazy with her own happine&s;s, to meet again her little benefactre&s;s where &s;he
<PB N="127" REF="026643_0132_0FD108E6E71C8AF0">

<P>AS Mr. Courtney, in returning home from a morning-ride, pa&s;&s;ed along the walls of a church-yard in a little village, his ears were &s;truck with the &s;ound of a mo&s;t piteous cry, which &s;eemed to proceed from it. This hu|mane gentleman had too feeling a heart to he&s;i|tate in ha&s;tening to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the unhap|py per&s;on whom he heard in &s;uch di&s;tre&s;s. He alighted from his hor&s;e, which he gave to the care of the &s;ervant who attended him, and then jumped over the wall into the church-yard.

<P>THE child's father is a &s;hoe-maker, that lives next door: and an hone&s;t, &s;ober, hard-working man he is; quite young &s;till, and very well look|ing. His wife was a good pretty woman; but &s;he had a poor con&s;titution, though &s;he was in|du&s;trious enough, and a very good hou&s;e-wife.

'Tis about &s;even years ago that they were mar|ried, and they lived very well together, and would have made the happie&s;t couple in the world, if they had but had a little more money. But John had nothing be&s;ides his trade; and Margery was without father or mother, and carried nothing to her hu&s;band, but a little mo|ney &s;he had &s;aved, when &s;he was at &s;ervice at the good par&s;on's that belongs to a pari&s;h about nine miles off. This little money they &s;pent in buy|ing a bed, and &s;ome crockery ware, and things for hou&s;e-keeping, and a little &s;tore of leather for their work. And, poor as they were, they found means to live pretty well, for the fir&s;t years of their marriage, by good care and hard work. But, then came a family; that was the thing that fir&s;t brought them into trouble. But, however, they would have got out of that dif|ficulty, by doubling their diligence, if it had not been for other misfortunes. Poor Margery, who worked in the fields all day long in the &s;ummer, to get a little money to carry at night to her hu&s;band, fell &s;ick with over work and was ill all the autumn, and all the winter and phy&s;ick is very dear. Be&s;ides that, bu&s;ine&s;s w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> on very badly, becau&s;e John's cu&s;tomers, by little and little, left him off, thinking they &s;hould be but ill &s;erved in a hou&s;e where there was a woman always &s;ick. By and by, howe|ver, Margery got up again; but her hu&s;band's bu&s;ine&s;s was ruined. They were forced to bor|row money to pay the doctor and apothecary. John had no more work to do, for he had lo&s;t all his cu&s;tomers; and Margery could get little or nothing, becau&s;e her &s;trength was &s;o gone,
<PB N="131" REF="026643_0136_0FD108ECD0A24918">
that no body would employ her. And, be&s;ides all this, the rent of their hou&s;e, and the intere&s;t they were obliged to pay for the money they h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d borrowed, quite cru&s;hed them. They were &s;ometimes obliged to go without food; and if they had but a mor&s;el of br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ad to give their children, they thought them&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ves happy enough.</P>
<P>(AT the&s;e words, little Jemmy ran into a corner, and began to cry.)</P>
<P>BESIDES all this, their hard-hearted landlord, &s;eeing they could not pay their winter's quarter, threatened John he would have him taken up. They begged and prayed him to have patience till harve&s;t-time, becau&s;e then they could get a little money, by working in the fields as day-labourers: but neither their begging nor their praying could melt him; for all he was richer than any body in all the village. It was a &s;ad trouble to them to make him agree to wait only for one month; and he &s;aid, that if he was not paid every thing by the end of that, he would &s;ell all their goods, and put John in pri&s;on. From that time forward, tho&s;e poor people were &s;o &s;ad and &s;orrowful, it would have melted a rock to have &s;ee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> them. You may think, Sir, how it mu&s;t move my heart, to hear my poor neigh|bours bemoan them&s;elves &s;o, and to have no|thing to help them with. I went once my&s;elf to their creditor, and begged him to have &s;ome pity on their misfortunes: and I offered to pawn to him all the things I was worth, for their &s;akes. But it all an&s;wered no end. You are but a poor wretch your&s;elf, &s;ays he, any more than they; and this comes of letting one's hou&s;es to &s;uch a &s;et of vagabonds. Ah, Sir!

I took this hardne&s;s patiently, for fear of making him &s;till wor&s;e; but I was &s;adly afflicted to think I was only a poor widow, and could do nothing at all for &s;uch hone&s;t people. What a deal of good the rich might do, if they had but the &s;ame good-will towards it that the poor have! But to come back to my poor neighbours. I ad|vi&s;ed Margery to go to the par&s;on, where &s;he had lived in &s;ervice &s;o many years, with a good and fair character, and tell him her misfortunes, and pray him to lend her a little money. She told me &s;he would &s;peak of it to her hu&s;band; but that it would be a hard matter to do it, for fear the par&s;on &s;hould think they had fallen &s;o low by their own bad behaviour. Three days ago &s;he brought me, according to cu&s;tom, her two children, and a&s;ked me to keep them till night: &s;he &s;aid &s;he would go to the next village, and &s;ee if &s;he could not get &s;ome hemp for &s;pinning, in order to pay their debt. But &s;he could not pluck up courage to go to her old ma&s;ter the par&s;on; and &s;o her hu&s;band &s;aid he would go in her &s;tead; and he &s;et out that &s;ame day. I was ready enough to take care of the children, becau&s;e I loved them dearly, for I had known them both from their births. Margery, when &s;he went away, ki&s;&s;ed them and hugged them again and again, as if &s;he knew &s;he was &s;eeing them for the la&s;t time. I think I &s;ee her &s;till! She had her eyes full of tears, and &s;he &s;aid to the elde&s;t: Don't you cry, Jemmy; I &s;hall &s;oon be back, and then I'll come and fetch you. Then &s;he held out her hand to me, thank|ed me for letting her children &s;tay with me, ki&s;&s;ed them both again, and went away.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="026643_0138_0FD108EFDB82FFD0">SOME time after, I heard a loud &s;ound in her hou&s;e; but, as I thought &s;he was gone, I took it for granted it was nothing but a faggot of wood &s;tanding loo&s;e again&s;t the wall, that hap|pened to tumble down; and &s;o I never minded it. Evening however came, and night came too, and &s;till I &s;aw nothing of neighbour Mar|gery. So then I thought I would go to her hou&s;e, to &s;ee whether &s;he was not gone there fir&s;t, to put by her flax, before &s;he came to take home her children. The door was open; &s;o I went in. O good Lord! how was I &s;truck, to &s;ee Margery lying down on the ground, at the foot of the &s;tairs &s;tiff-dead! I &s;tood my&s;elf quite fixed, and as cold as a &s;tone. I did not know what to do. At la&s;t, after trying to no end to lift her up, I ran to the &s;urgeon, who came back with me, felt her pul&s;e, and &s;hook his head, and then called a jury to &s;it on her body. The jury and the &s;urgeon together tried to find out how &s;he had been killed; and they &s;aid &s;he mu&s;t have died at once of the fall, or el&s;e, for want of help, have gone off in fainting-fits. Now I can tell well enough how it all happened. She had gone back to her hou&s;e to get a bag from the garret to bring the hemp in, and her eyes being a little mi&s;ty with crying, &s;he did not &s;ee where &s;he had put her foot in coming down the garret-&s;tairs, and &s;o &s;he fell, head foremo&s;t, from top to bottom, upon the &s;tone floor. This I know, becau&s;e of the bag's being at her &s;ide. But for all this, our ju&s;tice had different thoughts: he gave orders to have the body buried the next day in a corner of the church-yard; and he &s;aid he would &s;earch far and near to find out what
<PB N="134" REF="026643_0139_0FD108F31A424E28">
was gone with John. I offered him to keep both the children my&s;elf; for, hard as I find it to live, I always &s;ay to my&s;elf: God knows I am but a poor widow; and &s;o, if he gives the&s;e children to my care, he will &s;ee and help me to rear them. However, the little brother of him you &s;ee here, did not &s;tay with me long; for it was but ye&s;terday, a few hours after Margery was buried, that the good par&s;on that &s;he had lived with, happened to call to &s;ee her. He knocked &s;ome time at the door; and, as nobo|dy opened it, he came up to my window, and a&s;ked me what was gone with John, the poor &s;hoe-maker, that lived at the next hou&s;e. I told him, that if he would give him&s;elf the trouble to come in for a moment. I had a great many things to tell him about John, and about Margery too. So he came in, and &s;at down ju&s;t where you do. I told him all that had hap|pened; and it brought the tears into his eyes. And then I told him that John had thought of begging a little help of him in his difficulties. He looked quite amazed, and told me he had not &s;o much as &s;een John. The two children came up to him: and he played with them a good while; and Jemmy a&s;ked him if he could not wake his mammy for him, for &s;he had be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n a&s;leep a long while. The good par&s;on had the tears in his eyes again, when he heard the poor child talk &s;o; and he &s;aid to me: Good woman, I &s;hall &s;end to-morrow for both the&s;e little boys, and I will keep them at my hou&s;e. If their father comes back again, and &s;hould be in a way to bring them up him&s;elf, he &s;hall have them whenever he de&s;ires. But in the mean time, I

will take care my&s;elf to have them educated. I can't &s;ay I liked much to hear this. I love the little &s;ouls like a mother, and it would have co&s;t me very dear to lo&s;e them &s;o &s;oon. So I &s;aid: Sir, I don't know how to bring my&s;elf to part from the&s;e children; I am &s;o u&s;ed to them, and they are &s;o u&s;ed to me.&mdash;Well, then, good wo|man, &s;ays he, you &s;hall let me have one, and I'll leave you the other, as I &s;ee he will be &s;o well off with you. And I will &s;end you from time to time, &s;omething to help to keep him. So I could not refu&s;e that much to the good par|&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n. So then he a&s;ked Jemmy if he &s;hould not like to go with him? What there, where mam|my is? &s;ays Jemmy. O yes, that I &s;hall! No, my little dear, &s;ays he, it is not there; 'tis to my pretty hou&s;e, and pretty garden.&mdash; No, no, no, &s;ays Jemmy, I'll &s;tay here with Sarah; and I can go every day to look for mam|my, and I like that better than your pretty hou&s;e and garden. The good par&s;on would not pe&s;ter the poor child any more, for he had run to hide him&s;elf up in the curtains of my bed. So he &s;aid he would &s;end his man for the younge&s;t of them, who would have been more a trouble to me than the elde&s;t; and he left me &s;ome money to help on with Jemmy. So, Sir, this is all I have to tell you of Jemmy's relations.&mdash;But what makes me mo&s;t &s;orry now, is, that John never &s;hould come home again; and that the folks have &s;et it a going, that he is gone among a parcel of &s;mugglers, and that his wife killed her&s;elf for concern at it. The&s;e fibs have run about &s;o in the village, that the very babies have them in their mouths; and when my little

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR WIFE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"I am very &s;orry to think what trouble you mu&s;t have been in at my ab&s;ence: but I mu&s;t tell you how it all happened. As I was upon the road to go to the worthy clergyman, y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ur late ma&s;ter, this thought came into my head: What good, thinks I, will come to me by turn|ing beggar? it's only getting out of one debt, to get into another; and then I &s;hall never be at re&s;t for thinking how I &s;hall pay it. At my age, to go and a&s;k for money, when I am able to work for it, is a &s;hame. They'll only think me either lazy or extravagant. The worthy par&s;on married us him&s;elf, and he looks upon us as his children: but &s;uppo&s;e he &s;hould refu&s;e me out of &s;corn; or el&s;e that it &s;hould not be in his power to help us? Be&s;ides, &s;uppo&s;ing he would lend me the money for a whole year, how do I know if I could pay him at the end? and if I did not, how am I any better than a robber? I &s;hall have impo&s;ed upon him. So this was what I &s;aid to my&s;elf about it, my dear Margery; and then I began to think how I could get us both out of the&s;e difficu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ties, in an hone&s;t way. But I did not know what to do; and I was very mournful, and &s;adly at a lo&s;s; when all at once it came into my mind: thinks I, Why, I am &s;till but young, and I am tall and &s;trong; what harm would it do me to turn &s;oldier for a few years? I can write and read, and ca&s;t accounts prettily enough: and then I may make my own fortune, and my wife's and children's be&s;ide; or, at lea&s;t, I can get free of my debts. So if once I am but fixed, why, as &s;oon as I get any thing, I can &s;end it
<PB N="141" REF="026643_0146_0FD10902368DC648">
to poor Margery. So I turned all the&s;e tho'ts in my mind for about half an hour, and then I happened to &s;ee, ju&s;t behind me, a couple of &s;oldiers. They &s;oon joined me, and a&s;ked me where I came from, and where I was going to, and whether I &s;hould like to &s;erve the King? I made them believe, at fir&s;t, that I had no mind to their bu&s;ine&s;s: and they pre&s;&s;ed me a good deal, and promi&s;ed me the good round &s;um of &s;ix pound ten; &s;o I told them, that, up|on that condition, I would bind my&s;elf to them for &s;ix years. Done! &s;ays they, &s;o come along with us, and the affair &s;hall be &s;ettled at once. Then they took me before an officer, and had me mea&s;ured; and a&s;ked if I could read and write, and ca&s;t accounts; and when I &s;aid Yes, they &s;oon made them give me the money. And &s;o, as you &s;ee, my dear Margery, I am now turned a &s;oldier, on purpo&s;e to get us clear of our difficulties. I &s;end you the &s;ix pound ten, for I would not keep a penny out of it for my|&s;elf. Pay off at once the four pound five that I owe, and the &s;ix &s;hillings intere&s;t; and with the re&s;t, do the be&s;t you can for keeping hou&s;e. Nur&s;e your&s;elf well, that you may get back your &s;trength; and buy clothes for the children, and &s;end them to &s;chool. I know you are care|ful and indu&s;trious, and will make the mo&s;t you can of every thing. My pay will be four-pence a day; and I &s;hall try to &s;ave one or two out of it, every day, to &s;end to you at the end of the month: and in a little while, I &s;hall a&s;k leave of ab&s;ence, that I may go and &s;ee you, my dear Margery.

His only con|&s;olation for that, is in continually talking of her, with the faithful Sarah. The good woman looks upon her&s;elf as his &s;i&s;ter, and as the mo|ther of his children. Little Jemmy has not yet &s;uffered one day to pa&s;s, without again vi&s;it|ing the grave of his mammy: but he has made &s;uch good u&s;e of the opportunity which Mr. Courtney has given him for improvement, that the mo&s;t advantageous plan for his future wel|fare, is already formed by that benevolent gen|tleman. He has al&s;o taken care that the &s;ame attention &s;hall be paid to his younger brother: nor has he ever, from that time to this, moun|ted his hor&s;e, without recalling to his mind this touching adventure: and whenever he is him|&s;elf tormented by di&s;tre&s;s or misfortune, he ha&s;|tens to vi&s;it tho&s;e whom his own genero&s;ity has made happy, and never fails to return to his family lightened of all his &s;orrows.</P>

<HEAD>THE MASONS ON THE LADDER.</HEAD>
<P>AS Mr. Durand was walking out one day, with his little &s;on Ambro&s;e, through &s;ome of the public &s;treets, they &s;topped to look at a hou&s;e which was building, and already rai&s;ed to the &s;econd &s;tory.</P>
<P>AMBROSE ob&s;erved &s;everal workmen &s;tanding one above another upon the &s;teps of a high lad|der, who were &s;ucce&s;&s;ively lifting up, and letting fall down, their arms. This &s;ight rai&s;ed his cu|rio&s;ity. Papa, cried he, what game are the&s;e men playing at? Let us go nearer the foot of the ladder, and &s;ee.</P>
<P>THEY now put them&s;elves in a place where they could make their remarks without any dan|ger. They then perceived a man, who, from a large pile of &s;tones, took out one, which he carried to another man, who &s;tood upon the fir&s;t &s;tep of the ladder; and who, lifting it up with both his hands above his head, gave it to a third, who &s;tood &s;till higher, and who, in the &s;ame manner, pa&s;&s;ed it on to a fourth. And thus, from one to another, the &s;tone at length arrived at the top of the &s;caffolding, where the ma&s;ons were in readine&s;s to go to work with it.</P>
<P>WHAT do you think of all this? &s;aid Mr. Durand to his &s;on; can you tell why &s;uch a number of people &s;hould be employed in build|ing this one hou&s;e? Should you think it better to
<PB N="145" REF="026643_0150_0FD1091016B24D80">
have one workman go on with it alone, and &s;o to let every man build a hou&s;e by him&s;elf?</P>
<P>YES, indeed, I &s;hould, replied Ambro&s;e; for there would then be a great many more hou&s;es than there are now.</P>
<P>DO you con&s;ider well what you are &s;aying? cried Mr. Durand: do you know how many different trades and arts belong to the building of a hou&s;e; that, if one man alone &s;hould un|dertake it, he mu&s;t be well acquainted with them all; and that he might pa&s;s his whole life in acquiring &s;uch variety of knowledge, before he would know enough of the matter to &s;et about any building at all?</P>
<P>AND even &s;uppo&s;ing him able to learn, in a &s;hort time, all he &s;hould know for that purpo&s;e; how &s;lowly mu&s;t he proceed, if wholly without help; fir&s;t, in digging the earth in order to pre|pare the foundation; then in collecting, and bringing to the &s;pot, the &s;tones or bricks for the &s;tructure; then in &s;haping them; in pre|paring the mortar, pla&s;ter, and lime, and what|ever el&s;e is required in the bu&s;ine&s;s of a ma&s;on! Imagine him, however, now here, and in full &s;pirits, &s;ettling his dimen&s;ions, rai&s;ing his lad|ders, and running up his &s;caffoldings;&mdash;in what time do you think, all alone, he could build his hou&s;e to the roof?</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ambro&s;e.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why indeed; papa, I am afraid he would never be able to fini&s;h it quite, without a little help.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Durand.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think not, indeed. And you may make the &s;ame ob&s;ervation upon all the works of a community, as upon the build|ing of this hou&s;e. When any man takes a fancy
<PB N="146" REF="026643_0151_0FD1091186B715F0">
to retire from &s;ociety, and labour by him&s;elf; when, from the fear of being obliged to others for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he refu&s;es to work with them; he wa&s;tes both his &s;trength and his time in the attempt, and is always, in the end, compelled to abandon it. But where we mutually aid and help one another, we can perform, in a &s;hort time, the mo&s;t difficult and laborious things, and &s;uch as, undertaken &s;ingly, might each re|quire the life of a man to execute.</P>
</SP>
<P>IT is the &s;ame al&s;o, with our amu&s;ements and plea&s;ures. Tho&s;e who would enjoy them alone, and &s;elfi&s;hly, mu&s;t confine them&s;elves to a very &s;mall number: but if every one would unite in contributing to the happine&s;s of others, each would be certain of an ample portion for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>IN time, my dear Ambro&s;e, you will enter into the world: let the example, therefore, of the&s;e workmen, be ever pre&s;ent to your memo|ry. You &s;ee, from the mutual help which they give to one another, how much &s;horter and ea&s;ier are the labours of all. We will come this way again in a few days, and we &s;hall find, by their united indu&s;try, their hou&s;e will be nearly fini&s;hed. Endeavour, then, always to a&s;&s;i&s;t others in their employments, if you wi&s;h to have them ready and willing to a&s;&s;i&s;t you in yours.</P>

<HEAD>PHILIPPA AND MAXIMILIAN.</HEAD>
<P>MRS. CARLTON was left a widow very young, with two children, named Philippa and Maximilian. Each of them alike merited her tenderne&s;s, though it was be&s;towed upon them with the greate&s;t inequality. Phi|lippa, notwith&s;tanding her youth, was very &s;en&s;ible of her mama's partiality in favour of her brother; but, however unhappy it &s;ometimes made her, &s;he concealed in her own litt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;om, all the unea&s;ine&s;s which it cau&s;ed her.</P>
<P>HER face and figure, though not frightfully ugly, were by no means upon a par with her heart and under&s;tanding: while her brother was as beautiful as a little Cupid. Mrs. Car<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ton re|&s;erved for him all her fondne&s;s and care&s;&s;es; and even the &s;ervants of the hou&s;e, in order to make their court to their mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;eemed to think of nothing but diverting him, and com|plying with all his humours. Philippa, on the contrary, becau&s;e always checked and reproved by her mother, was certain of being treated &s;till wor&s;e by the dome&s;tics. Far from &s;tudying her inclinations, they did not even &s;upply her with nece&s;&s;aries. When &s;he found her&s;elf quite
<PB N="168" REF="026643_0173_0FD1094B888EAC80">
alone, and thought her&s;elf de&s;erted and forgot|ten, &s;he &s;ometimes bur&s;t into a flood of tears; but never, before any witne&s;&s;es, &s;uffered the &s;malle&s;t complaint to e&s;cape her, or &s;hewed the lea&s;t &s;ign of di&s;content. It was in vain &s;he &s;trove, by a con&s;tant application to all her ta&s;ks, by gentlene&s;s, and the mo&s;t active de&s;ire of obliging, to make amends in the &s;ight of her mother for what &s;he wanted in beauty: the qualities of the mind are lo&s;t upon tho&s;e who accu&s;tom them&s;elves to value nothing but out|ward appearances. Mrs. Carleton, little moved by the proofs of duty or regard &s;he received from Philippa, e&s;pecially &s;ince the death of her father, &s;eemed never even to look at her with|out reluctance. She reprimanded her perpetu|ally; and required from her &s;uch perfection, as ought not, with ju&s;tice, to have been expected, even from an age and under&s;tanding far more advan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed.</P>
<P>THIS unju&s;t parent at length had a fit of &s;ickne&s;s. Maximilian appeared very truly con|cerned for her &s;ufferings; but Philippa, who in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">guid looks and &s;unk features of her ma|ma, fancied &s;he perceived an abatement of her u&s;ual rigour, far exceeded her brother in her attentions and tenderne&s;s. She watched every turn of her eye, that &s;he might di&s;cover her wi&s;hes, and &s;ave her the trouble of &s;peaking them, by bringing of her own accord whatever &s;he thought it likely &s;he could want. She would not once quit her bed-&s;ide while there was any appearance of danger; and neither entreaties nor commands could prevail with her to take a moment's re&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="026643_0174_0FD1094CF77C0E48">MRS. Carlton, however, at length recovered. This much-de&s;ired re&s;toration of health remov|ed all the fears of Philippa; but her unhappine&s;s returned at the &s;ame time, when &s;he found her mother as har&s;h with her as ever.</P>
<P>ONE day, when Mrs. Carlton was conver&s;|ing with her children upon the mi&s;ery &s;he had &s;uffered in her illne&s;s, and was thanking them both for the kindne&s;s with which they had nur&s;|ed and attended her; &s;he &s;aid: My dear children, you may each of you a&s;k from me whatever you think will give you mo&s;t plea&s;ure: and I will promi&s;e to grant it, be it what it may, &s;o that it does not exceed the limits of my income. What &s;hould you like, Maximilian? addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf fir&s;t to her &s;on. A watch and a &s;word, mama, he an&s;wered.&mdash;You &s;hall have them both to-morrow, as &s;oon as you ri&s;e. And you, Philippa, what will you have?&mdash;M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">? mama, me? cried Philippa, trembling, O, I want nothing at all, if you do but love me.&mdash; That is no an&s;wer, child; I mean to give you, al&s;o, &s;ome recompence for your attention to me. What, therefore, &s;hould you like? Sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">, when I bid you. Philippa, though accu&s;tomed to this &s;everity, felt more than u&s;ually hurt by it upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. She threw her&s;elf upon her knees before her mother's chair, and looked up to her with her eyes full of tears; then, hiding her face with both her hands, &s;he &s;tammered out: Give to me, then, only two &s;uch ki&s;&s;es as you gave my brother!</P>
<P>MRS. Carlton, touched at heart by this un|expected reque&s;t, felt awakened at that moment all tho&s;e &s;entiments of affection for her daughter,
<PB N="170" REF="026643_0175_0FD1094E4A496858">
which hitherto had been &s;tifled. She took her in her arms, pre&s;&s;ed her fondly to her bo&s;om, and ki&s;&s;ed her a thou&s;and times. Philippa, who now fir&s;t received from her mother any marks of her kindne&s;s, gave her&s;elf wholly up to joy; ki&s;&s;ing, in her tran&s;port, her eyes, her cheeks, her hair, her hands, and her gown. Maximil|ian, who had never been able to help loving his &s;i&s;ter, joined in their mutual care&s;&s;es: and they all three enjoyed a happine&s;s which was not li|mited to that &s;hort in&s;tant. Mrs. Carlton, henceforward, be&s;towed with intere&s;t upon Phi|lippa all the fondne&s;s &s;he had hitherto denied her; and Philippa returned it with &s;till increa&s;|ing attachment. Maximilian, far from being jealous, made his &s;i&s;ter's felicity a plea&s;ure to him&s;elf; and he found in a &s;hort time the re|ward of this genero&s;ity. The natural goodne&s;s of his di&s;po&s;ition had been &s;omewhat injured by the weakne&s;s and blindne&s;s of his mother; and as he grew up, many little follies and errors e&s;caped him, that might have weaned her love from him, had not Philippa always made it her &s;tudy to excu&s;e him. The good advice which, from time to time, &s;he gave to him, brought him back into the right road; and they all three learnt this le&s;&s;on from their own experience: That there can be no happine&s;s in any family without the mo&s;t perfect union between brothers and &s;i&s;ters, and the mo&s;t equal and impartial tenderne&s;s to them from their parents.</P>

<HEAD>THE LAMB.</HEAD>
<P>LITTLE Phebe, a poor &s;hepherd's daugh|ter, was &s;itting one morning by the &s;ide of a great road, holding upon her lap a porringer of milk, into which &s;he was dipping &s;ome brown bread for her breakfa&s;t.</P>
<P>DURING this little repa&s;t, a carrier came the &s;ame way, who was driving twenty live lambs to market, in a cart. The&s;e poor little animals, heaped one upon another with their legs tied, and their heads drooping, filled the air with the mo&s;t &s;orrowful bleatings, which went to the very heart of Phebe, though the carrier heard them without pity. When he came up to her, he flung a poor little lamb before her, that he was carrying by the heels, upon his &s;houlder. There, child, cried he, there's a good-for-no|thing bea&s;t for you, that has ju&s;t died, to cheat me of a crown. Take it, if you will, and make your&s;elf a fea&s;t with it.</P>
<P>PHEBE immediately left off eating her break|fa&s;t, and, putting the porringer and the bread on the ground, took the lamb in her arms, and looked at it with the utmo&s;t compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>POOR little creature! cried &s;he; yet why &s;hould I be &s;orry for you? To-day, or to|morrow, they would only have taken a great knife, and cut your poor throat; and now, in|&s;tead of that, you have nothing more to go through. While &s;he was talking to it in this manner, the lamb, growing warm again in her

arms, began to open its eyes and move, and made a fain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> bleating cry, as if pining for its dam.</P>
<P>IT would be difficult to de&s;cribe the joy of Phebe at the &s;ound of its voice. She wrapped it up in her apron, then covered it over again with her fu&s;tian coat, and bent her neck almo&s;t down upon her knees to keep it warmer, breath|ing, at the &s;ame time, with all her might, into its no&s;trils. By little and little, &s;he felt the poor animal revive, and her own heart beat with joy every time it &s;hewed any &s;igns of life. En|couraged by this &s;ucce&s;s, &s;he rolled up &s;ome crumbs in her hands, put them into her por|ringer, and taking them out with her fingers, contrived, though not without much difficulty, to force them between its teeth, though they were &s;hut very clo&s;e. The Lamb, who was only dying from want, felt it&s;elf a little &s;trength|ened by this nouri&s;hment. She now began to &s;tretch out her legs, and &s;hake her head and her tail, and perk up her ears; and &s;oon after, &s;he was &s;o much better as to &s;tand upon her feet; and then, &s;eeing the porringer with Phebe's breakfa&s;t, &s;he went and drank out of it her&s;elf, to the great delight of the little girl. In &s;hort, a quarter of an hour had hardly pa&s;&s;ed, before &s;he was &s;o well recovered, as to cut a thou&s;and capers round her new little mi&s;tre&s;s. Phebe, in a tran&s;port of joy, took her in her arms, and running with her into the cottage, &s;hewed her to her mother. Little Baalam, as &s;he now called her, became from this time the object of all her cares. She always &s;hared with her the bread and milk &s;he was allowed from her own
<PB N="173" REF="026643_0178_0FD1095444182FF0">
meals; and &s;he would not have parted with this one little lamb, for the large&s;t flock of &s;heep in the village. Baalam was &s;o grateful for her kindne&s;s, that &s;he was never a &s;tep di&s;|&s;tant from her. She would eat out of her hand, and fri&s;k perpetually round about her; and whenever Phebe was forced to go out without her, the mo&s;t plaintive bleating &s;poke her &s;orrow at the parting.</P>
<P>THE pity and good-nature of Phebe, howe|ver, had &s;till a greater recompence. Baalam was &s;oon the mother of &s;everal other little lambs, who, in their turn, grew the mother of more: &s;o that, in a few years, Phebe had a very pretty flock of &s;heep, entirely her own; which fed the family with their milk, and &s;upplied them with clothes from their wool.</P>

<HEAD>THE VINE-STALK.</HEAD>
<P>IN the beginning of the &s;pring, Mr. Sefton took a walk one day about his country hou&s;e, with his &s;on Jerry. The violets and primro&s;es were in full blow; and many of the trees were already budding forth their green leaves, while others were bright and gay with white or crim|&s;on blo&s;&s;oms, that promi&s;ed the fine&s;t fruits. They &s;trolled on till they came to an alley of lattice-work, at the foot of which was planted a vine, who&s;e rough and crooked &s;tem &s;pread, without beauty or order, its brown and naked &s;talk all over the lattice. Papa, cried Jerry, do

<P>JERRY then began pulling at it as hard as he could, in order to force it up by the roots; but the roots were too deep in the earth for his &s;trength. Pray let it alone, cried Mr. Sefton; I will not have it removed. I &s;hall tell you, in due time, my rea&s;ons.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jerry.</SPEAKER>
<P>But only look, papa, at tho&s;e beau|tiful blo&s;&s;oms of the almond and peach trees! why &s;hould not the vine be as pretty too, if it has a mind not to be pulled up? It &s;poils and de&s;troys the whole look of every thing. Shall I go and tell the gardener to come and drag it away?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sefton.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, my dear, I would have it &s;tay where it is, a little while longer.</P>
</SP>
<P>JERRY &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in abu&s;ing it: his father endeavoured to turn his attention upon other objects; and, at la&s;t, the unfortunate vine-&s;talk was forgotten.</P>
<P>MR. Sefton's affairs, &s;oon after, carried him to a town at &s;ome di&s;tance, where he was de|tained till the autumn.</P>
<P>HIS fir&s;t care then, was to vi&s;it his country &s;eat; and he again took his little &s;on with him. The weather was extremely hot, and they &s;ought &s;helter from the rays of the &s;un, by walking in the alley of lattice-work.</P>
<P>AH, papa! cried Jerry, how beautiful is this green, and this &s;hade! How glad I am you made them take away that na&s;ty dry old wood that I was &s;o vexed to &s;ee in the &s;pring, and
<PB N="175" REF="026643_0180_0FD109580865FE70">
&s;urpri&s;e me by putting in its place the mo&s;t charming tree that ever I &s;aw in my life! What delightful fruit it has! Only look at the&s;e fine grapes, &s;ome green, &s;ome purple, others almo&s;t black! There is not one &s;ingle tree in the whole garden that makes &s;o good a figure as this. Almo&s;t all the re&s;t have lo&s;t their fruit; but this, only look, papa, how it is covered! &s;ee what thick clu&s;ters there are under all the&s;e large green leaves! I &s;hould like to know whether they are as &s;weet-ta&s;ted as they are pretty.</P>
<P>MR. Sefton gave him one to make trial of. It was the mu&s;cadine &s;ort. His tran&s;ports were now increa&s;ed; and &s;till more, when his father informed him, that it was from pre&s;&s;ing the&s;e grapes that the delightful juice was produced which he &s;ometimes had ta&s;ted at table, after dinner.</P>
<P>I &s;ee, my dear, how you are &s;urpri&s;ed, &s;aid Mr. Sefton; but your amazement will be yet greater, when I tell you that this is the very &s;ame tree, &s;o dry, brown, twi&s;ted, and &s;prawl|ing, which you &s;o much &s;coffed at in the &s;pring. Shall I now, then, call the gardener, and tell him to root it up, and heat his oven with it?</P>
<P>O, not for the world, papa! I would rather have him root up every tree in the garden. That mu&s;cadine is &s;o good!</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sefton.</SPEAKER>
<P>You &s;ee, then, Jerry, how well I did, not to follow your advice. What has happened to you, frequently happens in life. At &s;ight of an ill-dre&s;&s;ed or ugly child, the richer and happier are but too apt to de&s;pi&s;e him; to grow proud by being compared with him, and even to have the cruelty to in&s;ult and deride

<HEAD>THE FARMER.</HEAD>
<P>AS Mr. Dodwell was one day &s;hut up in his library, where he was &s;ettling &s;ome affairs of importance, a &s;ervant came to tell him that farmer Mathews, one of his tenants, was at the &s;treet-door, and de&s;ired to &s;peak with him. Mr. Dodwell gave orders that he &s;hould be &s;hewn into the anti-chamber, and de&s;ired to wait there for a few minutes, while he fini&s;hed his bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>ROGER, Alexander, and Sophy, three chil|dren of Mr. Dodwell, were in the anti-chamber at the time farmer Mathews was car|ried there. He made them the mo&s;t re&s;pectful bow as he came into the room, though it was ea&s;y to di&s;cover he had never received any le&s;&s;ons
<PB N="178" REF="026643_0183_0FD1095C84BA6F18">
from a dancing ma&s;ter. Neither was his lan|guage, nor his manner of &s;peaking to them, at all more courtly.</P>
<P>THE two little boys looked and &s;miled at one another, with an air of ridicule. They exa|mined the hone&s;t farmer from head to foot, with a di&s;dainful eye, whi&s;pered one another in the ear, and bur&s;t out into &s;uch &s;houts of laughter, that the poor man coloured, and knew not which way to turn him&s;elf.</P>
<P>ROGER even carried his ill-breeding &s;o far, as to hold his no&s;trils, and call out to his bro|ther: Alexander, Lord! what a &s;trong &s;mell here is of dung! He then went for a chafing-di&s;h of hot coals, with which he walked up and down the chamber, burning paper and &s;ealing-wax, to take off, he &s;aid, the bad odour. He next rung for one of the &s;ervants, and told him to bring a broom, and &s;weep away the dirt that poor Mathews had made upon the floor with his &s;hoes. Mean while, Alexander held his &s;ides with laughter at the impertinence of his brother.</P>
<P>IT was not the &s;ame with their &s;i&s;ter Sophy. Far from imitating the rudene&s;s of her brothers, &s;he reproved them for their want of civility, endeavoured to make excu&s;es to the farmer, and going up to him with a look of great &s;weetne&s;s, &s;he a&s;ked if he would have any wine to refre&s;h him&s;elf, made him &s;it down, and took his hat and &s;tick her&s;elf, and put them upon the table.</P>
<P>AT this time Mr. Dodwell entered the room. He advanced with a friendly air to Mathews, took him by the hand, enquired after his wife and children, and what was the bu&s;ine&s;s which had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">de him come to town.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="026643_0184_0FD1095EC5EA38A0">I have brought you my quarter's rent, Sir, an&s;wered Mathews, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rawing from his pocket a leather bag full of money. Don't be angry that I am two or three days behind my time; for the roads are &s;o broken up, that I could not any &s;ooner carry my corn to market.</P>
<P>I am not angry with you at all, an&s;wered Mr. Dodwell; I know you are a very hone&s;t man, and that there is no need to remind you of your debts.</P>
<P>AND then he ordered a table to be brought forward, for the farmer to count his money upon.</P>
<P>ROGER &s;tared very hard at the &s;ight of Ma|thew's crowns and half-guineas, and looked at him now with a little le&s;s contempt.</P>
<P>When Mr. Dodwell had examined the far|mer's accounts, and prai&s;ed his exactne&s;s, the good man produced a ba&s;ket of dried fruit, which he had baked: See, Sir, cried he, I have brought this for your young gentlefolks. Won't you let them come, &s;ome day, Sir, to take a little country air? I'll fea&s;t them the be&s;t I can, and try if I can't find them &s;ome amu&s;ement. I have got very good hor&s;es; and I can come for them my&s;elf, and bring them back at night in my chai&s;e-cart. Mr. Dodwell promi&s;ed he would him&s;elf go and &s;ee him, and begged him to &s;tay to dinner. Mathews thanked him for his kind invitation, but excu&s;ed him&s;elf from accepting it, becau&s;e he had &s;ome purcha&s;es to make in town, and was in great ha&s;te to get back to his farm.</P>
<P>MR. Dodwell had his ba&s;ket then filled with cakes to carry to his children, and tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed him
<PB N="179" REF="026643_0185_0FD10962F6492010">
for the pre&s;ent he had brought to his own; and, after wi&s;hing him &s;trength for his hard labour, and health to &s;upport his family, he &s;aw him to the head of the &s;tairs, and then bid him good-day.</P>
<P>HE was no &s;ooner gone, than Sophy, before both her brothers, told her father how rudely they had behaved to hone&s;t Mathews upon his arrival.</P>
<P>MR. Dodwell expre&s;&s;ed much di&s;plea&s;ure at Roger and Alexander, and, at the &s;ame time, warmly prai&s;ed Sophy for the difference of her conduct. I am glad to &s;ee, &s;aid he, ki&s;&s;ing her tenderly, that my dear Sophy &s;o well knows what civility is due to all hone&s;t people.</P>
<P>IT was now breakfa&s;t time; and he ordered the farmer's dried fruits to be brought upon the table, and eat part of them him&s;elf, with his daughter. They both found them very good. Roger and Alexander breakfa&s;ted at the &s;ame time, but were neither of them invited to par|take of the fruit. With their eyes, however, they devoured it all.</P>
<P>MR. Dodwell pretended not to ob&s;erve them; but again began a prai&s;e of Sophy, charging her never to de&s;pi&s;e any body on account of the plainne&s;s of their clothes: Becau&s;e, &s;aid he, if we only are well-bred to tho&s;e who are finely dre&s;&s;ed, it will &s;eem as if our politene&s;s was to the gown, or the coat, and not to the per&s;ons who wear them. Tho&s;e who are the wor&s;t dre&s;&s;ed, are &s;ometimes the be&s;t people. Mathews is an example of this him&s;elf: he not only ma|nages, by his indu&s;try, to maintain him&s;elf, and his wife, and his children; but, for the&s;e
<PB N="180" REF="026643_0186_0FD0F9C841542238">
four years that he has been my tenant, he has paid his rent with &s;uch exactne&s;s, that I have never once had to call upon him for his money. You don't know, perhaps, my dear Sophy, that if this man were le&s;s hone&s;t, I could not my&s;elf &s;upply all the expences of you and your brothers. It is he, in fact, who buys you clothes, and procures you a good education; for all that I receive from him, I re&s;erve entire|ly for your dre&s;s, and your different ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>WHEN breakfa&s;t was over, Mr. Dodwell gave orders to have the re&s;t of the fruit locked up in a buffet. Roger and Alexander looked greedily after it; though they ea&s;ily under&s;tood it was not pre&s;erved for their &s;akes.</P>
<P>THEIR father confirmed this di&s;appointment to them. Expect not, he &s;aid, to ta&s;te, either to-day, or any other day, tho&s;e fruits. When the farmer, who brought them for you, has better rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied with your behavi|our. he will not forget to &s;end you more.</P>

<P>ALL her own children were already there in their be&s;t clothes. How do you do? and, You are very welcome, they all cried to their young gue&s;ts, while they bowed and curt&s;ied with the utmo&s;t re&s;pect. Mr. Dodwell wi&s;hed much to
<PB N="183" REF="026643_0188_0FD1096C6C9377F0">
talk a little with them, and care&s;s them; but dame Mathews entreated him to come in, for fear the coffee and rolls &s;hould grow cold, which &s;he had got for their breakfa&s;t.</P>
<P>IT was all ready, and upon a table covered over with the white&s;t cloth. It was not, indeed, &s;erved in &s;ilver, nor even in china; but though the delft was ordinary, it was perfectly clean and neat.</P>
<P>ROGER and Alexander looked &s;lyly at each other, and would have &s;houted with laughter, but from fear of making their papa angry. Dame Mathews, however, &s;aw by their grima|ces what pa&s;&s;ed in their minds: &s;he made an excu&s;e, that her things were no better; and &s;aid, that to be &s;ure they would have been help|ed in finer di&s;hes at their own hou&s;e, but that they mu&s;t take in good part what was given them with a hearty welcome.</P>
<P>BESIDE the rolls, they had &s;ome home|made cakes, which were &s;o extremely good, that it was ea&s;y to di&s;cover the ho&s;pitable woman had exerted her utmo&s;t &s;kill both in making and baking them.</P>
<P>AFTER breakfa&s;t, Mathews begged Mr. Dod|well to give a look at his orchard and his grounds. Dame Mathews u&s;ed her utmo&s;t endeavours to make this walk plea&s;ant to the children. She &s;hewed them her flocks of &s;heep, with which the meadows were covered, and picked out &s;ome of the prettie&s;t little lambs for them to play with. She next carried them to her pige|on-hou&s;e, where every thing was neat and clean. Upon the ground there were two young doves, that were ju&s;t quitting their ne&s;ts, but not yet
<PB N="183" REF="026643_0189_0FD1096F4E24C210">
bold enough to venture to tru&s;t to their own little fluttering wings. Some of the females were &s;itting upon eggs in their &s;mall hou&s;es; and others were occupied by feeding their young, but ju&s;t coming out of their &s;hells.</P>
<P>FROM the pigeon-hou&s;e they went to the bee-hives. Dame Mathews took care not to let them come too near, yet placed them where they could plainly &s;ee the little creatures at work.</P>
<P>AS the greate&s;t part of the&s;e things was quite new to them both, they appeared extremely en|tertained with them: and they were even beg|ging to look at them all a &s;econd time, when Tommy, the farmer's younge&s;t &s;on, ran to tell them that dinner was waiting.</P>
<P>IT was &s;erved upon pewter di&s;hes, and it was helped in earthen plates: but Roger and Alex|ander were both put into &s;uch good-humour by all they had been looking at in the morning, that they were a&s;hamed to give way any longer to their turn for ridicule. They found every thing nice and well dre&s;&s;ed; for dame Mathews had done the be&s;t &s;he po&s;&s;ibly could to regale them.</P>
<P>WHILE they were eating fruit after dinner, Mr. Dodwell perceived two fiddles hanging up again&s;t the wall. Who have you that plays upon the&s;e in&s;truments here? &s;aid he. My elde&s;t boy and my&s;elf, an&s;wered the farmer; and, without a word more, he made a &s;ign to his &s;on to unhook the violins. They then took it in turn to play &s;ome little old ballads, now of a mournful ca&s;t, and now gay and jolly, with &s;uch readine&s;s, and &s;o much de&s;ire of obliging,
<PB N="184" REF="026643_0190_0FD10971B9281098">
that Mr. Dodwell both felt and expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t &s;atisfaction at their performance.</P>
<P>WHEN they were going to hang up the in|&s;truments again in their places, No, no, cried Mr. Dodwell, it is now your turns, Roger and Alexander, to try what you can do for our en|tertainment. Come, play us &s;ome of your prettie&s;t tunes. In &s;aying the&s;e words, he put the violins into their hands; but they knew not how even to hold the bow, and their aukward|ne&s;s and confu&s;ion rai&s;ed a general laugh.</P>
<P>MR. Dodwell then begged the farmer to or|der his hor&s;es out, that they might return home. Mathews was very urgent in pre&s;&s;ing them to &s;tay all night; but Mr. Dodwell could &s;pare no more time, and therefore they took leave.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Dodwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who, then, at la&s;t, has the greater profit from the farm, Mathews, or your father? It is true, indeed, he feeds his hor&s;es with the hay he makes out of my meadows; but tho&s;e hor&s;es are employed in tilling the land, which, otherwi&s;e, would be over-run with weeds. He feeds, al&s;o, as you &s;ay, his &s;heep and his cows with the &s;ame hay; but they &s;up|ply dung for the ground that lies fallow, which again makes it fertile. His wife and children, too, live upon the corn reaped in the harve&s;ts; but they &s;pend the &s;ummer in weeding that corn, and then thre&s;hing it in the barns: and all this, in the conclu&s;ion, is my own advantage. The overplus of his crops, he carries to &s;ell at market; but is it not to pay me his rent, that he gets the money? And as to what may re|main, after I have received my dues, does he not well de&s;erve what his own indu&s;try procures him? Once more, then, tell me, who is it has the greate&s;t profit, he or I?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why&mdash;I &s;ee now it is you.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Dodwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what profit &s;hould I have without his labours?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, there are enough other farmers in the world!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dodwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>True; but there are not any more valuable than this man. The tenant who rented this very farm of me before I let it to Mathews, cut down the trees, exhau&s;ted the &s;oil, and &s;uffered the barns and out-hou&s;es to run to ruin. When the quarter-days came, he was never ready with his money; and when I complained to him of his neglect, he repre&s;ent|ed
<PB N="188" REF="026643_0193_0FD1097CC3C2FB70">

<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, to this hone&s;t farmer.</P>

I will not be a&s;hamed to acknowledge that, but for you, I had perhaps committed an action I mu&s;t have repented for all the re&s;t of my life. Here, take back your money; and be &s;ure ever to make that worthy u&s;e of it, which your excellent mo|ther commanded: and fear not that I will ever &s;uffer it to be exhau&s;ted. No, I will renew it my&s;elf, while you continue &s;o well to employ it. Your favourite little wood, my dear chil|dren, &s;hall not be taken from you; and may the friend&s;hip you now feel for one another unite you for ever!</P>

<P>Certainly, very right: but if the orders they receive are unju&s;t, it is their duty, and their God, they ought to obey fir&s;t. If your own heart did not tell you that I &s;uffer|ed

<P>The rea&s;on, I fear, was that &s;he too well fore&s;aw the unworthy u&s;e you would make of it.

<P>MAMA, will you give me leave to go and &s;ee my cou&s;in Harry this evening?</P>

<P>Why not, mama?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Beaumont.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't think it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to tell you my rea&s;ons: a little girl, &s;uch as you, &s;hould obey her parents, without allowing her&s;elf the liberty of a&s;king any que&s;|tions. But neverthele&s;s, to &s;hew you that I have always rational motives, both for what I order, and for what I forbid, I will, for this once, acquaint you what they are. Your cou|&s;in Harry can only &s;et you a bad example; and I fear, if you were to &s;ee him often, he might teach you to be as thoughtle&s;s and indi&s;creet as him&s;elf.</P>

<P>No an&s;wer, Aurelia! you know very well that I mu&s;t always be obeyed.</P>

<P>AURELIA now went to the further end of the apartment, to hide the tears which were &s;wimming in her eyes; but, as &s;oon as ever
<PB N="226" REF="026643_0231_0FD109CE5A078B30">
her mama was gone out, &s;he &s;eated her&s;elf in a corner, and gave full vent to her &s;orrow.</P>
<P>AT this time, Nanny, a maid &s;ervant but lately hired, came into the room. Why, what's the matter, Mi&s;s Aurelia? &s;aid &s;he, are you crying? what is it for? won't you tell me who it is that vexes you &s;o?</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aurelia.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, go, Nanny; you can do no|thing to help me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>And how can you tell that? When I lived with Mi&s;s Sophy, &s;he was always &s;ure to come to me, whenever any thing was the matter. Ah, my dear Nanny, &s;he u&s;ed to &s;ay&punc; now you know what has happened to me, tell me what I &s;hall do. And then I always u&s;ed to give her &s;ome good advice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aurelia.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I don't want your advice. I tell you again that you can do nothing at all for me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, at lea&s;t, then, let me go and &s;ee for your mama. She can give you &s;ome comfort, if I can't: and I don't like to &s;ee &s;uch a pretty young lady fretting &s;o.</P>

<P>O yes, certainly, mama will give me great comfort!</P>

<SPEAKER>Nanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I &s;hould never have thought it! I am &s;ure, &s;o &s;en&s;ible as you are, there is nothing your mama need refu&s;e you. I am &s;ure, if I had a child of my own, as well be|haved as you are, I &s;hould let her do every thing &s;he had a mind. But your mama loves dearly to give orders; and, for the &s;ake of her

own maggots, &s;he will refu&s;e you the mo&s;t in|nocent things in the world. How can any bo|dy take a plea&s;ure in contradicting &s;uch a &s;weet child! You can't think how it grieves me to &s;ee you in &s;uch trouble.</P>

I dare &s;ay, Nanny, I &s;hall die with grief!</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>So I am afraid, too. How red and &s;welled your eyes are! I am &s;ure it is very wrong of you, and very cruel, not to let the people that really love you, try to give you &s;ome comfort. If my little Mi&s;s Sophy had only been half as unhappy, &s;he would have opened her whole heart to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aurelia.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I mu&s;t never open mine to you, Nanny!</P>

<P>It is not for my own &s;ake, I am &s;ure, that I want you to do it.&mdash;Perhaps it is becau&s;e your mama makes you &s;tay here at home, when &s;he is gone out her&s;elf to take a walk.</P>

No, no; I mu&s;t never have that plea&s;ure any more!</P>

<P>Nay, it will be no hard matter to get you that. A young lady &s;hould not be left alone &s;o. I &s;uppo&s;e your mama does not want to make a nun of you?</P>

<SPEAKER>Nanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Forbid to &s;ee him! very pretty, in|deed! Why, what has your mama got in her head? This is ju&s;t exactly like Mi&s;s Sophy's mama: &s;he took the very &s;ame maggot; &s;he would not permit her to &s;ee the lea&s;t in the world of little Billy. But we knew better than to mind her. O, how cunningly we u&s;ed to cheat her!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aurelia.</SPEAKER>
<P>And how did you do it?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Nanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, we always watched for the time of her making her vi&s;its; and then Mi&s;s Sophy u&s;ed to go and &s;ee little Billy, or el&s;e lit|tle Billy u&s;ed to come and &s;ee Mi&s;s Sophy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>And did not her mama find it out?</P>

<SP>

<P>No; I always kept a look-out for them my&s;elf.</P>

<P>I &s;hould only tell her you were play|ing in the garden; or, if it &s;hould happen to be a little late, I &s;hould &s;ay you were gone to bed, and fa&s;t a&s;leep: and then I &s;hould run out &s;lyly, and bring you home.</P>

<P>Ah! if I thought mama would know nothing of it!&mdash;</P>
</SP>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aurelia.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hould like to try it for once. But then you will promi&s;e that mama&mdash;</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Go, go; don't be afraid.</P>
</SP>
<P>AURELIA now gave way, and, with a little further encouragement, went to &s;ee her cou&s;in.
<PB N="229" REF="026643_0234_0FD109D3C227F4C8">
Her mama returned home &s;oon after, and im|mediately enquired for her. Nanny an&s;wered that &s;he was tired of being alone, but had eat a very hearty &s;upper, and was gone to bed.</P>
<P>IN this manner, Aurelia deceived her un&s;u&s;|pecting mother &s;everal times. Alas! thought|le&s;s little girl! was it not rather her&s;elf that &s;he deceived by &s;uch behaviour? Till now, &s;he had always been gay and happy; &s;he delighted in the pre&s;ence of her mama, and flew joyfully to meet her, if &s;he had been &s;eparated from her even for a moment. Where, now, was this plea&s;ure fled? She was continually &s;aying to her&s;elf: O! if mama was to know where I have been! She trembled even at the &s;ound of her voice. When ever &s;he &s;aw her grave or unea&s;y, O! thought &s;he, I am undone! Mama has di&s;covered my di&s;obedience! Neither was this all her unhappine&s;s. The artful Nanny perpetually told her of the genero&s;ity which had been &s;hewn her by Mi&s;s Sophy, how often &s;he had given her money and pre&s;ents, and with what confidence &s;he always had tru&s;ted her with the key of the tea-che&s;t. Aurelia was all eager|ne&s;s to de&s;erve from Nanny the &s;ame prai&s;e for genero&s;ity and confidence that &s;he be&s;towed upon Mi&s;s Sophy. She took every opportunity of &s;tealing tea and &s;ugar for her, of her mama; and &s;he even contrived to get for her the keys of the cellar and &s;tore-room.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES, however, &s;he li&s;tened to the reproaches of her con&s;cience. I am acting very ill, &s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf; and all that I am doing may &s;ooner or later be di&s;covered: and then I &s;hall lo&s;e all mama's love entirely! Frightened
<PB N="230" REF="026643_0235_0FD109D5479FF338">
at this thought, &s;he flew to Nanny, and warmly prote&s;ted &s;he would give her nothing more. O, ju&s;t as you plea&s;e, Mi&s;s, an&s;wered Nanny; but have a care! you may perhaps repent this! Your mama is coming,&mdash;and I &s;hall let her know how well you have minded her orders.</P>
<P>AURELIA could then only cry, and do every thing that Nanny was plea&s;ed to command. Formerly it was the place of Nanny to obey Aurelia; but now it became the place of Aure|lia to obey Nanny. She was obliged to bear with all her in&s;olence and rudene&s;s, and had not a creature to whom &s;he dared even complain.</P>
<P>ONE day, this artful and wicked maid came to Aurelia, and &s;aid, I have a great longing to ta&s;te that tart that is locked up in the buffet; and I want a bottle of wine be&s;ides. So you mu&s;t go and look in your mama's drawers for the keys.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aurelia.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, my dear Nanny,&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nanny&punc;</SPEAKER>
<P>O, none of your dear Nannys! on|ly go and do what I a&s;k you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aurelia.</SPEAKER>
<P>But mama may &s;ee me; or, if &s;he &s;hould not, God will, Nanny; and then he will puni&s;h us well!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>And did not he &s;ee you too, every time you went to your cou&s;in? Yet I don't find that he has puni&s;hed you for it.</P>
</SP>
<P>AURELIA had received from her mother the mo&s;t excellent le&s;&s;ons of religion; &s;he was firm|ly per&s;uaded that God has always his eyes upon his creatures, that he recompen&s;es our good actions, and only forbids our committing bad ones, becau&s;e they are really hurtful to our&s;elves. It was from mere childi&s;h folly that &s;he made
<PB N="231" REF="026643_0236_0FD109D8A3225AB0">
her vi&s;it to her cou&s;in again&s;t the con&s;ent of her mama. But it almo&s;t con&s;tantly comes to pa&s;s, that when we are led into one error, we fall &s;oon after into errors without end. She thought her&s;elf now compelled to do every thing that the maid directed, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould be provoked, by a refu&s;al, to betray her. It may ea&s;ily, there|fore, be imagined how much &s;he had to bear from her.</P>
<P>SHE one day &s;hut her&s;elf up in her chamber, merely to have the liberty of crying at her ea&s;e. O good God! cried &s;he, &s;obbing, what a &s;ad thing it is to di&s;obey you! Poor unhappy little girl that I am! I am become quite the &s;lave of my maid! I can do no longer what is my du|ty, becau&s;e I mu&s;t do every thing which that wicked woman bids me.

<P>SHE then hurried out of her chamber, and &s;eeing her mama walking alone in the garden,
<PB N="232" REF="026643_0237_0FD109DC039DC800">
&s;he flew up to her, threw her&s;elf into her arms, and, while &s;he embraced her, wetted her cheeks and her bo&s;om with her tears: but &s;hame and di&s;tre&s;s kept her from &s;peaking.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Beaumont.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, mi&s;erable child! you will indeed be puni&s;hed enough!</P>
</SP>
<P>MRS. Beaumont at the&s;e words walked away, and left Aurelia in utter de&s;pair upon a green bank on which &s;he had thrown her&s;elf: &s;he went in&s;tantly to her hu&s;band; and they con&s;idered together upon what means mu&s;t be u&s;ed to &s;ave their child from ruin.</P>
<P>SOON after, they went for Nanny; and, hav|ing reproached her with the utmo&s;t &s;everity and indignation, Mr. Beaumont ordered her in|&s;tantly to leave the hou&s;e. It was in vain &s;he cried, and begged to be treated with le&s;s hard|ne&s;s; and in vain &s;he made a thou&s;and promi&s;es never to offend in the &s;ame manner for the fu|ture: Mr. Beaumont was re&s;olute. You know well, cried he, with what kindne&s;s I have be|haved to you, and with what patience I have borne with your faults. I hoped to have en|gaged you, by my indulgence, to have &s;econded my cares in the education of my child; in&s;tead of which, it is you your&s;elf who have led her to theft and di&s;obedience. I look upon you as
<PB N="234" REF="026643_0239_0FD109E061EFCA38">
a mon&s;ter. Quit my &s;ight in&s;tantly, and think well of your own reformation, if you hope to &s;ave your&s;elf from falling into the hands of a far more terrible Judge.</P>
<P>AURELIA's turn was next. She came into the pre&s;ence of her parents in a &s;tate that might well excite compa&s;&s;ion. Her eyes were inflam|ed with crying, and all her features were &s;wolen. Her cheeks were pale with terror, and her whole frame trembled as if &s;he had been in the &s;hiver|ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">it of an ague. Unable to utter a &s;ingle word, &s;he waited in mournful &s;ilence to hear the &s;entence of her father.</P>
<P>YOU have deceived, cried he, in a voice of &s;everity, you have deceived and you have of|fended your parents. What could induce you to li&s;ten to a worthle&s;s &s;ervant, in preference to a mother who &s;o tenderly loves you, and who wi&s;hes nothing upon earth &s;o much as your happine&s;s? Were I to puni&s;h you with all the indignation with which you have filled me, and to bani&s;h you for ever from my &s;ight, as I have done the accomplice of your fault, is there any body, do you think, who could accu&s;e me of inju&s;tice?</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aurelia.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, papa, you can never be unju&s;t to me: and if you puni&s;h me with all the &s;eve|rity that you can, I &s;hall bear it all; but only begin fir&s;t by taking me once more in your arms, and once more calling me your poor Aurelia!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Beaumont.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I can by no means &s;o &s;oon forgive you. The confe&s;&s;ion which you have made of your own accord, prevails with me not to bani&s;h you from my &s;ight; but I
<PB N="235" REF="026643_0240_0FD109E20DB5B460">
cannot call you again my child, and my Aure|lia, till you have merited my kindne&s;s by a long repentance. Attend well to your own be|haviour. Puni&s;hment always follows faults, and you will &s;oon find your&s;elf your own pun|i&s;her in having committed them.</P>
<P>AURELIA did not well under&s;tand her papa's meaning in the&s;e la&s;t words. She expected yet greater &s;everity, and &s;he approached him almo&s;t broken-hearted; &s;he ki&s;&s;ed his hands, and again promi&s;ed the mo&s;t perfect duty and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion for the future.</P>
<P>SHE kept her word: but alas! the puni&s;h|ment with which her father threatned her, &s;oon followed. The worthle&s;s Nanny &s;pread every where the mo&s;t injurious reports. She related what had pa&s;&s;ed between them, with the addi|tion of many frightful fal&s;ehoods. She declared that Aurelia, by &s;ervile and pre&s;&s;ing entreaties, and a thou&s;and pre&s;ents which &s;he &s;tole from her father and mother, tried &s;o continually to corrupt her, that &s;he had been at length pre|vailed upon to contrive &s;ecret meetings for her with her cou&s;in Harry; that they &s;aw one ano|ther, unknown to their parents, regularly every night, and that it was frequently extremely late before Aurelia returned home. And to this ac|count &s;he added &s;o many horrid circum&s;tances, that every body conceived the mo&s;t di&s;advanta|geous opinion of Aurelia.</P>
<P>SHE was forced to bear, therefore, the mo&s;t cruel mortifications. When &s;he went into the company of other little girls, &s;he &s;aw them all whi&s;per one another, and look at her with an air of the utmo&s;t di&s;dain, or el&s;e with the mo&s;t
<PB N="236" REF="026643_0241_0FD109E3908EE058">
in&s;ulting &s;miles. If &s;he &s;tayed later than u&s;ual any where, they would &s;ay, "I &s;uppo&s;e &s;he waits till the time comes for her meeting her cou&s;in Harry!" If &s;he had a fa&s;hionable ribbon, or any new ornaments, they would exclaim: "O, people who can get at their mama's keys, may very well contrive to buy new things!" And if &s;he had the mo&s;t trifling di&s;pute with any of them, they would cry: "You had bet|ter hold your peace, Mi&s;s Aurelia, for you think &s;o much of your cou&s;in Harry, that you don't know what you talk of."</P>
<P>THESE reproaches were &s;o many pointed needles to tear the heart of Aurelia. And fre|quently, quite overpowered by her &s;orrows, &s;he would throw her&s;elf, in an agony, into her mo|ther's arms, and entreat pity and comfort from her.</P>
<P>HER mother generally an&s;wered: You mu&s;t &s;uffer, Aurelia, with patience, the puni&s;hment which your errors have drawn upon you; and you mu&s;t pray to Heaven to pardon your faults, and to &s;horten the time of your correction. The&s;e trials may mend you for all the re&s;t of your life, if you attend to them properly. God has commanded all children to honour their father and their mother, and to &s;ubmit in every thing to their orders. This command is for their own happine&s;s. Poor little things! they know nothing of the world them&s;elves; they cannot fore&s;ee the con&s;equences of their own actions: God, therefore, has put the care of you into the hands of your parents, who love you as they love them&s;elves, and who have experience and reflection to enable them to &s;ave you from
<PB N="237" REF="026643_0242_0FD109E54D0E4130">
the dangers which every way &s;urround you. This, however, you did not chu&s;e to believe: and now you find, with but too much affliction, the wi&s;dom of God in his commands, &s;ince your di&s;obedience to them has co&s;t you &s;o dear. Ah! my Aurelia, may your &s;uffering at lea&s;t be your improvement! Every command|ment of God is equally wi&s;e: he ordains no|thing that is not for our advantage; he forbids nothing that would not do us injury. It is our|&s;elves, therefore, that we hurt, every time we commit any evil. You may often find your&s;elf in &s;ituations where you cannot, at fir&s;t, perceive either how vice may harm, or virtue &s;erve you. Always, at the&s;e times, call back to your mind your own &s;ufferings from one &s;ingle failure in duty, and regulate every action of your life by this infallible maxim:
<Q><L>"Whatever is contrary to virtue,</L>
<L>"is contrary to happine&s;s."</L></Q></P>
</SP>
<P>AURELIA now followed with &s;trictne&s;s all the advice of her mother: and the more &s;he had to &s;uffer from the errors of her conduct, the more attentive &s;he became to all &s;he &s;aid or did. And, in the end, from the manner in which &s;he bore this di&s;grace, &s;he not only &s;ilenced all her cen&s;u|rers, but even acquired the glorious name of the faultle&s;s Aurelia.</P>

<P>HAROLD had received from Nature a melancholy di&s;po&s;ition, with a penetra|ting under&s;tanding. When he walked out with his uncle, every thing that he &s;aw, awakened &s;ome reflection, and gave ri&s;e to new thought|fulne&s;s. His cou&s;ins frequently complained, that while he &s;eemed him&s;elf &s;o much engaged, he took no trouble in contributing to the gene|ral amu&s;ement of the hou&s;e. They even re|&s;olved, among them&s;elves, to beg that their fa|ther would not let him walk out with them any more: but a gentler method of correcting him, came afterwards into their minds. They agreed together to practi&s;e, for &s;ome days, the very &s;ame conduct towards him, that he practi&s;ed towards others. One of them went to &s;ee &s;ome fine pictures; another, &s;ome new buildings; and a third, a collection of natural curio&s;ities: but when they returned home, they kept to them&s;elves all the accounts, which they had formerly been eager to relate, of what they had &s;een or heard; and in&s;tead of that mutual com|munication of the plea&s;ures of the day, which had made their evenings lively and agreeable, they had nothing now in common, but formal gravity, and a tire&s;ome &s;ilence. Harold remarked
<PB N="245" REF="026643_0250_0FD109FEACD927C8">
this change with equal &s;urpri&s;e and vexation. He felt the want of that gaiety, and openne&s;s of conver&s;ation, which, though he rarely gave way to, made, in fact, all his entertainment. Accu&s;tomed, however, to reflection and con&s;i|deration, it taught him immediately the inju&s;|tice of his own behaviour: and he &s;oon became as communicative, as he had hitherto been re|&s;erved. In giving way to that &s;ocial openne&s;s, with which Nature has gifted mankind for their mutual ble&s;&s;ing, attachment, and union, his own heart fir&s;t ta&s;ted the &s;weets of friend&s;hip and benevolence; while the vigour and vivacity of his genius found fre&s;h employment and &s;ati&s;|faction, from the information he gathered, in return for what he imparted.</P>

<HEAD>THE LITTLE PRATE-APACE.</HEAD>
<P>LEONORA was a little girl of quick parts and vivacity. At only &s;ix years old, &s;he could both work and handle her &s;ci&s;&s;ars with much dexterity, and her mama's pincu&s;hions and hu&s;wifes were all of her making. She could read, with ea&s;e and readine&s;s, any book that was put into her hand: &s;he could al&s;o write very prettily, and &s;he never put large letters in the middle of a word, nor &s;crawled all awry, from corner to corner of her paper. Neither were her &s;trokes &s;o &s;prawling, that five or &s;ix
<PB N="246" REF="026643_0251_0FD10A018D5E1E80">
words would fill a whole &s;heet, from the top to the bottom; as I have known to be the ca&s;e with &s;ome other little girls of the &s;ame age.</P>
<P>HER papa and mama had as much rea&s;on to be plea&s;ed with her obedience, as her ma&s;ter had with her indu&s;try. She lived in the greate&s;t harmony with her &s;i&s;ters, behaved to all the &s;ervants with civility, and to her play-fellows with the utmo&s;t good-nature and de&s;ire of obliging. The old friends of the family, and the &s;trangers who made a new acquaintance with it, &s;eemed equally delighted with her man|ners and accompli&s;hments.</P>
<P>WHO could believe, that with &s;uch qual|ities, &s;uch talents, &s;uch good-breeding, &s;he who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them could be in&s;upportable? Such however was, unhappily, the misfortune of Leonora.</P>
<P>ONE fault, though a &s;ingle one, of which &s;he was guilty, almo&s;t wholly de&s;troyed the effect of all her acquirements: her trouble&s;ome fondne&s;s of talking &s;oon made every one forget the merit of her mind, and the goodne&s;s of her heart. The little Leonora was the greate&s;t <HI>prate-apace</HI> in the univer&s;e.</P>
<P>IN the morning, for example, when &s;he took her work, &s;he would fir&s;t begin with &s;aying: Well, it is high time now to be a little bu&s;y. What would mama &s;ay, if &s;he were to come and &s;ee me &s;itting with my hands before me? O dear! what a mon&s;trous long piece I have got here to &s;ew! Well, thank Heaven, I am no &s;luggard, &s;o I &s;hall &s;oon contrive to &s;ee the end of it. Ah! here now the clock &s;trikes; one, two, three, four, five, &s;ix, &s;even, eight,
<PB N="247" REF="026643_0252_0FD10A0323BFE2D0">
nine:&mdash;Well, I have two hours yet before I need go to the harp&s;icord. One may do a good deal of work in two hours. I know mama will give me &s;ome &s;weet-meats to reward me. O what plea&s;ure I &s;hall have in eating them! I love nothing &s;o much as &s;weetmeats, though French plumbs are very good too. Papa gave me &s;ome the other day. But I think almonds and rai&s;ins are be&s;t; or, at lea&s;t, better than any thing el&s;e, except &s;weetmeats. Now, if Dolly would but come to day, I &s;hould &s;hew her my new trimming. She is a very good-natured girl, that Dolly, only &s;he loves talking too much &mdash;one can't get in a &s;ingle word for her. Why now where is my thimble? Si&s;ter, have not you &s;een my thimble? I dare &s;ay Jenny has taken it away with her. That tire&s;ome creature is always doing &s;ome mi&s;chief. Who can work, now, without a thimble? The needle will be always running into one's finger. And then one's finger will be bleeding, and that will hurt one &s;o! and dirty all one's work be&s;ides. Jenny! Jenny! why where are you now? Do you know any thing of my thimble? No, here it is &mdash;all entangled in my thread.</P>
<P>IN this manner, the little thing would chat|ter ince&s;&s;antly all day long. When her father and mother were conver&s;ing together upon &s;ub|jects of the utmo&s;t importance, &s;he would come with her idle prattle and interrupt their di&s;|cour&s;e. At dinner &s;he was frequently only be|ginning her &s;oup, when the re&s;t of the family had fini&s;hed their meal. She forgot both to drink and to eat, in her eagerne&s;s to be eternal|ly talking.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="026643_0253_0FD10A04D2C59290">HER father every day, and repeatedly, repri|manded her for this fault: but both reproaches and remon&s;trances were equally vain. Neither had correction any better effect.</P>
<P>AS &s;he &s;uffered nobody to be heard but her|&s;elf, &s;he was frequently &s;ent up &s;tairs alone into her own chamber, in order to be kept out of the way. At other times, they made her, du|ring dinner, &s;it at a little table by her&s;elf, as far off from the family as po&s;&s;ible. Leonora was &s;orry and a&s;hamed, but &s;he did not the more reform. She always found &s;omething to &s;ay aloud to her&s;elf, when &s;he could &s;eize upon no one el&s;e to hear her. Rather than be &s;ilent, &s;he would begin to prattle with her knife and fork.</P>
<P>AND what did &s;he gain by per&s;evering in this trouble&s;ome habit? Nothing, my little friends, as you will &s;oon &s;ee, but mortification and ha|tred. I will tell you, now, what &s;he was one day obliged to endure.</P>
<P>HER father and mother were invited by a friend, to go and &s;pend a few days in the coun|try. It was in the autumn; the weather was delightful; and there had never, in any &s;ea&s;on, been a greater abundance of peaches, nectarines, apples, and pears.</P>
<P>LEONORA had the fulle&s;t expectation of mak|ing one in this party. She was greatly &s;urpri|&s;ed, therefore, when her father bid her little &s;i&s;|ters, Julia and Cecilia, prepare for the journey, and, at the &s;ame time, turning to her, told her &s;he mu&s;t &s;tay at home. She f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ew, all in tears, to her mother, and called out: O mama, what have I done to make papa in &s;uch a pa&s;&s;ion with me?</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="026643_0254_0FD10A06E9FBC1C8">YOUR papa is not in a pa&s;&s;ion with you, an|&s;wered her mother; but there is no po&s;&s;ibility of enduring you in any &s;ociety. You interrupt all our peace and comfort by your impertient prating.</P>
<P>MUST I never &s;peak one word then? &s;aid Leonora.</P>
<P>THAT, an&s;wered her mother, would be near|ly as great a fault as this, of which we de&s;ire to correct you. But you mu&s;t always wait for your turn, and not perpetually interrupt your father and me, and people who are both older and wi&s;er than you can be. You ought, al&s;o, to break your&s;elf of that idle and trouble&s;ome trick of &s;aying every thing that comes into your head. When you wi&s;h to a&s;k any que&s;tion re|ally for your in&s;truction, you &s;hould do it in few words, and at once: and when you have any little account to give, always con&s;ider fir&s;t in your own mind, whether your friends, or who|ever you are &s;peaking to, are likely to wi&s;h to hear it.</P>
<P>LEONORA, however deficient &s;he might be in rea&s;ons, would at lea&s;t have found abundance of words in her own ju&s;tification, had &s;he not heard her papa's voice, calling aloud to her mother and &s;i&s;ters, that the carriage was waiting.</P>
<P>LEONORA &s;aw them &s;et off, with many &s;ighs; and followed the carriage with her eyes, which were &s;wimming in tears, as long as it was in &s;ight: and when &s;he could &s;ee it no more, &s;he went and &s;eated her&s;elf in a corner, and &s;pent the fir&s;t quarter of an hour in nothing but cry|ing. O wicked tongue! &s;aid &s;he, it is to you I owe all my misfortunes! But I will take care
<PB N="250" REF="026643_0255_0FD10A0B665B4A48">
you &s;hall never, never for the future, &s;ay one &s;ingle word more than you ought.</P>
<P>IN a few days the family returned. Her &s;i&s;|ters brought home ba&s;kets full of nuts and grapes; and, as they had excellent di&s;po&s;itions, their fir&s;t plea&s;ure was to beg Leonora to partake of their pre&s;ents: but Leonora was &s;o lo&s;t in melancholy, that &s;he would not even ta&s;te them. She went up to her father, and &s;aid to him: Ah! my dear papa, forgive me for making you puni&s;h me &s;o; for I am &s;ure you have been as &s;orry for it as my&s;elf: and &s;o I think we have both been &s;ufferers; but indeed, indeed, papa, I will never be &s;uch a prate-apace any more.</P>
<P>HER father embraced her tenderly; and the next morning, &s;he was permitted to breakfa&s;t at table with the re&s;t of the family. She &s;poke very little, and all &s;he &s;aid was mode&s;t and to the purpo&s;e. It is true, &s;he found it very diffi|cult, at fir&s;t, to keep her tongue in &s;uch order; for, unu&s;ed to any control, it was continually in motion, rolling from &s;ide to &s;ide of her mouth. But the day after, this re&s;traint grew le&s;s painful to her, and every following day &s;till le&s;s and le&s;s; till, by degrees, &s;he was able wholly to conquer her in&s;upportable love of chattering. And now &s;he perfectly under&s;tands how to bear her part in &s;ociety, without ever being impertinent, tire&s;ome, or intruding.</P>

<HEAD>The STRAWBERRIES and CURRANTS.</HEAD>
<P>ARCHIBALD had often been told by his fa|ther, that children know little or nothing of what is fit for them, and that they can never grow wi&s;e but by following the coun&s;el of tho&s;e who are older than them&s;elves. But this was a le&s;&s;on which he was unwilling to under&s;tand, or el&s;e, which he did not remember.</P>
<P>A divi&s;ion had been made of a little &s;quare piece of ground in the garden, between his bro|ther Percival and him&s;elf; and each had his own half at his entire di&s;po&s;al, with full permi&s;&s;ion to &s;ow or to plant in it whatever he plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>PERCIVAL immediately recollected his father's in&s;tructions. He went, therefore, to the gar|dener, and &s;aid to him: Robert, be &s;o good as to tell me what I can plant in my little garden, and how I mu&s;t manage to make things grow in it.</P>
<P>ROBERT gave him &s;ome roots, and picked him out &s;ome of his be&s;t &s;eeds. Percival flew to put them in the earth: and Robert had the good-nature to over-look and to direct his pro|ceedings.</P>
<P>ARCHIBALD only &s;hrugged his &s;houlders at the compliance of his brother. Should you like, &s;aid the gardener, that I &s;hould do &s;ome|thing al&s;o for you?</P>
<P>O, to be &s;ure, cried Archibald, I have great need of your advice!</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="026643_0257_0FD10A1072A0BD38">HE then went him&s;elf, and gathered &s;ome flowers, and planted them by the &s;talk in the ground; while Robert <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">im wholly to him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>THE next morning, Archibald went to vi&s;it his flowers, and &s;aw them all drooping, withered, faded, and bending down to the earth. He in|&s;tantly, however, planted more; but he &s;aw, the next day, that they had &s;hared the &s;ame fate.</P>
<P>HE &s;oon grew weary of this work. It was paying rather too dear for the plea&s;ure of having flowers in his garden. He cea&s;ed, therefore, to take any further trouble with it, and the ground was quickly covered with thi&s;tles and weeds.</P>
<P>ABOUT the latter end of the next &s;pring, he perceived, upon his brother's ground, &s;omething red, that &s;eemed budding in the mid&s;t of thick clu&s;ters of green. He went to examine it; and found the fine&s;t &s;trawberries, beautiful in their colour, and delicious in their ta&s;te. O dear! cried he, if I too had but planted &s;ome of the&s;e in my garden!</P>
<P>NOT long after, he ob&s;erved &s;ome little round things, of a deep vermillion, hanging in bunches between the leaves of a thick bu&s;h. He in&s;tant|ly went up to them. They were currants, &s;o fine, ripe, and inviting, that only to look at them might create an appetite. Ah! cried he again, if I had but planted &s;ome of the&s;e, too, in my garden!</P>
<P>YOU may eat of them, as if they were en|tirely yours, &s;aid his brother.</P>
<P>IT was all in your own power, &s;aid the gar|dener, to have had &s;ome equally good. So pray

</LETTER>
<P>O, he de&s;erves well to be called dear, indeed!</P>
<LETTER>
<P>"Our dear Frederick has behaved very ill. Some days ago, he &s;old his watch, and, what is wor&s;e, the greater part of his cla&s;&s;ical books, as well as all his books of devotion. I will tell you how I came to know it. An old book-&s;eller, who lets us have books at &s;econd-hand, came the other day to offer me the Chri&s;tian's Exerci&s;e. As mine is almo&s;t worn out, by fre|quent reading, I was very glad of the opportu|nity to buy another. He &s;hewed it me. I in|&s;tantly knew it to be Frederick's; and &s;o much the more certainly, becau&s;e his name was &s;crawl|ed in the title-page. I bought it for &s;ixpence; but I &s;aid nothing, that I might not di&s;grace him among our &s;chool-fellows. So I only car|ried it to our tutor, who &s;ent for the book-&s;eller, and enquired of whom he had the book.</P>
<P>THE book&s;eller confe&s;&s;ed he had purcha&s;ed it of my cou&s;in. Frederick could not deny it, and &s;aid he had &s;old it becau&s;e he wanted &s;ome mo|ney; and that, in the mean time, till he could buy another, he had borrowed one of a friend who happened to have two.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="026643_0262_0FD10A2151506750">OUR tutor in&s;i&s;ted upon knowing what he had done with the money. Frederick told him a long tale; but I &s;u&s;pect it was a mere fal&s;e|hood. Now, thought I to my&s;elf, I &s;hould like to find out if he has not al&s;o di&s;po&s;ed of &s;ome of his other things. And the fir&s;t that came into my head was that watch which you gave him for a new-year's gift, that he might keep &s;ome account how he &s;pent his time, which, as you may remember, he never much thought about. I a&s;ked him, therefore, what it was o'clock? He looked confu&s;ed, and an&s;wered, that his watch was at the watch-maker<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s. I then ran directly to the watch-maker's, to &s;ati&s;|fy my&s;elf. But there was not a word of truth in it. I then rea&s;oned to him about it, as one friend &s;hould to another. He replied, that it was no bu&s;ine&s;s of mine, and that his watch was in a much better place where he had put it, than keeping it in his fob; and that he did not want to look at the hour to tell him what he had to do. So who knows what may have happened to him &s;till wor&s;e? for there is no finding out every thing."</P>

<P>I have done it with the greate&s;t plea&s;ure; I have no merit in it at all. When your poor mother was alive, &s;he always acted the &s;ame, during my long voyages, by my own children. It was therefore my duty to return it. And I never in my life repented it till to|day; but . . . .</P>

<SPEAKER>Dolly.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Sir! if my brother has forgot him&s;elf ju&s;t for a moment, it is only from the ha&s;tine&s;s of his di&s;po&s;ition. You know, uncle, you had him for a long time under your own eyes; and I am &s;ure you mu&s;t remember, that whenever he did any thing that was not right, his repentance, and his &s;orrow for having made you angry, were always greater than his fault.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Vincent.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; and how many many fool's frolicks have I forgiven him! Did not he burn his eye-brows, and his hair, with his crackers? Did he not break a great looking-gla&s;s, by let|ting it fall out of the window, at the next door? Did he not tumble him&s;elf into a &s;lough, one day, when he had ju&s;t put his be&s;t coat on? Did he not drive my hand&s;ome new chariot into a ditch? And did not I pardon him every thing? I thought all the&s;e mi&s;chievous pranks were only owing to giddine&s;s, and not to a di&s;|po&s;ition naturally bad: but to &s;ell his watch, and his books, to &s;pend the whole night out of &s;chool, and rebel again&s;t his ma&s;ters, and then

<P>I thought &s;o my&s;elf! We all love him dearly, God knows, and would give up our very lives to &s;erve him. Whenever we did the lea&s;t thing in the world for him, he was &s;ure to make us amends. He was always rea|dy to &s;peak a good word for us, if his uncle was in anger; and he was the fir&s;t to do good to all the poor people in the village.

<PB N="265" REF="026643_0270_0FD10A3648EE9730">
he commits all the faults him&s;elf, and then has the cunning to throw them upon other people. This is not the fir&s;t time he has tried to &s;et papa again&s;t Frederick. Often and often, by &s;ome &s;ecret complaints of him, he has had him &s;ent out of the hou&s;e; and then afterwards, when every thing has come to light, it has been found that no body was to blame but him&s;elf.

So I hired my&s;elf out by the day to work in the fields; my wife was always at her &s;pinning; and my children went about begging charity. But, all of us together, we got &s;o little, that at the end of the week, we could not manage to pay for a little truckle-bed we hired in a garret: &s;o, in a little time, we had nothing but the &s;ky to cover us, and the ground to lie upon!

<P>PAPA, I can tell you of a very good &s;ervant when you turn away old John.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Bellamy.</SPEAKER>
<P>How now, Peregrine! This is a bad rea&s;on for di&s;charging an old &s;ervant. An old fellow, you call him; O Peregrine! you ought to be a&s;hamed of your&s;elf. Is it not in my &s;ervice that he is grown old? is it not even very probable that his attendance upon you in your childhood, and the concern and anxiety which he felt for your frequent illne&s;&s;es, have made him grow old before his time? How unrea&s;onable, therefore, and how ungrateful it would be, to take an aver&s;ion to him on ac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ount of his age! and do you fancy your&s;elf at all more ju&s;tifiable in telling me that a younger man would &s;uit us &s;o much better? A deci&s;ion
<PB N="290" REF="026643_0295_0FD10A9FEFE2ED28">
&s;uch as that requires far more experience than you can yet have had, and a judgment at which you cannot have arrived. I will, how|ever, convince you, in a few minutes, of the very &s;uperior advantages an old &s;ervant has over a young one, for fidelity, for exactne&s;s, and for knowledge of his bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>

<P>I believe it, to be &s;ure, papa, if you &s;ay &s;o. But then his wearing that wig! it &s;eems &s;o droll to &s;ee a man &s;tanding behind your chair, and waiting upon you, with a wig on! I can never look at him without being ready to bur&s;t out a laughing.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Bellamy.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is a bad account of your own di&s;po&s;ition, Peregrine, and &s;uch a one as I did not &s;u&s;pect you of de&s;erving. Do you not know that he lo&s;t his hair in a long and dangerous illne&s;s? Is not laughing at him, then, an in&s;ult on God, who inflicted upon him that illne&s;s?</P>

<P>No, no, Peregrine, he may be grave, or thoughtful; but I am &s;ure he is no grumbler.

<SPEAKER>Mr. Bellamy.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know very well, Peregrine, that I do not love to cha&s;ti&s;e you, and that it is a method of correction I employ very &s;eldom. It is by rea&s;oning, and by gentlene&s;s, that I endeavour to direct and to govern both you and your &s;i&s;ter.

<P>Poor old John! I know well it was ju&s;t the &s;ort of injury to wring his very heart.

</SP>

<P>Ah, papa, how much I have been to blame! I will go and a&s;k his pardon! and I promi&s;e you, for all my life long, that he &s;hall never have to complain of me again.</P>

<P>You will do very right; and on tho&s;e terms alone can you obtain forgivene&s;s for your&s;elf from God, or from your father.

<P>It is, perhaps the only plea|&s;ure which never grows weaker. Let your chief attention be to enjoy it in your own fami|ly. If your &s;ervants are worthy people, you may better &s;ecure their attachment to you by good offices, than by money. Not, however, that you &s;hould neglect, from time to time, making them &s;ome little pre&s;ents; and if you are careful to give them at proper &s;ea&s;ons, and with a good grace, you may in&s;ure your&s;elf a friend in every dome&s;tic in your hou&s;e.</P>

<SPEAKER>Peregrine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, papa, have not they their wages?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Bellamy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Their wages are merely the pay of their work: but a pre&s;ent is a matter of favour, and will not only excite their gratitude, but induce them to go beyond what is actually their duty in &s;erving you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peregrine.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't quite under&s;tand you, papa.</P>
</SP>

<P>I will explain my&s;elf, then by the in&s;tance of old John. I give him his wages, his clothes, and his food, in return for his time, his labour, and his &s;ervice: but when he has given me his time, his labour, and his &s;ervices, is he not out of my debt? Does he owe me yet more? Neverthele&s;s, you well know he takes care of every thing in my hou&s;e; that he has made him&s;elf &s;uperintendant over the re&s;t of the &s;ervants, and that he frequently &s;aves me from lo&s;&s;es and impo&s;ition. And this he does purely from per&s;onal regard to me, without any particular order from my&s;elf, and merely in
<PB N="296" REF="026643_0301_0FD0F9E768B9C800">
gratitude for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ndne&s;&s;es he has received from me, and the pre&s;ents which I have occa&s;ionally made him. When you are old enough to mix in the world, you will hear complaints of the ingratitude and carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of &s;ervants where|ever you go. But believe me, Peregrine, the fault is generally in the ma&s;ters, who &s;eem al|mo&s;t always more de&s;irous to be feared than to be loved.</P>

<P>CAPTAIN FORD, a brave officer who had re|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">red from &s;ervice, lived upon his own e&s;tate, with an excellent wife, and five children, who were every one o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">em worthy of &s;uch parents. All the inhabitants of the neighbouring villages felt the utmo&s;t re&s;pect for them; and the per|fect harmony which reigned in the whole fami|ly, made the &s;ight of it plea&s;ant&punc; and even af|fecting to all beholders. The &s;weetne&s;s of Captain Ford's di&s;po&s;ition, joined to the order and decorum pre&s;erved throughout his hou&s;e, in&s;ured to him the good-will and admiration of whoever had the happine&s;s of knowing him. All the young lads who lived near his e&s;tate
<PB N="297" REF="026643_0302_0FD0F9E92B95CE70">
were eager to enter into his &s;ervice; and when|ever there was a vacancy in his hou&s;ehold, by the death or di&s;charge of any dome&s;tic, the place was in&s;tantly &s;ought, as if it had been an employment of high honour. Chearfulne&s;s and content were marked upon the countenances of all who belonged to him. They &s;eemed but like humble and dutiful children waiting upon their father. His commands were always &s;o ju&s;t, and &s;o ea&s;y, that no one had even a wi&s;h to di&s;obey them. They lived together in as &s;trict a union as if they had been brothers: or, if they had ever any di&s;pute, it was but of zeal for the &s;ervice of their ma&s;ter, and of regard for his intere&s;t.</P>
<P>MR. Fenwick, an old comrade of Captain Ford, who had likewi&s;e retired to live in the country, though at a great di&s;tance from the e&s;tate of his friend, made him a vi&s;it one day, as he was pa&s;&s;ing near his hou&s;e in his way to the capital. After various other &s;ubjects, the conver&s;ation fell upon the many difficulties and inconveniences of hou&s;e-keeping. Mr. Fenwick declared that watching and &s;uperintending &s;er|vants was the greate&s;t of all fatigues, and that he had never met with any who were not either in&s;olent, lazy, or carele&s;s of their ma&s;ter's con|cerns. I have no &s;uch complaints, &s;aid Captain Ford, to make of mine. I have not, for the&s;e ten years pa&s;t, had one &s;erious &s;ubject of di&s;|plea&s;ure in my own hou&s;e. I am quite &s;atisfied with my &s;ervants, and they &s;eem equally &s;atisfied with me. You have uncommon good-luck, then, an&s;wered Mr. Fenwick; and you mu&s;t certainly have learnt &s;ome &s;ecret, fir&s;t of making

&s;ervants good, and then of keeping them &s;o. The &s;ecret, an&s;wered Captain Ford, is a very &s;imple one, and I will &s;hew it to you. He then brought forth a &s;trong box. What does this mean? cried Mr. Fenwick. Captain Ford, without making any reply, opened the box; and he then &s;aw &s;ix drawers, with the&s;e in&s;crip|tions. <HI>Extra expences.&mdash;My own.&mdash;My wife's.&mdash; My children's.&mdash;Servant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">' wages.&mdash;Grat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ities.</HI>&mdash; As I have always a year's income before-hand, Captain Ford now an&s;wered, I divide it into &s;ix parts at the beginning of every twelve-month. in the fir&s;t drawer, I put a certain &s;um, to be &s;trictly re&s;erved for unexpected demands and oc|ca&s;ions. In the &s;econd, is what I allow for my own private pur&s;e. The third contains what is nece&s;&s;ary for hou&s;e-keeping, and my wife's pin-money. The fourth, all that the education of my children, which is the be&s;t I can give them, ought to co&s;t me. The fifth, the &s;ervants' wages. And the &s;ixth, what I think proper to di&s;pen&s;e in pre&s;ents and gratuities to them. It is to this la&s;t drawer that I owe the happine&s;s of never having a bad &s;ervant. Their wages are only for what their &s;ervice makes their due; but the little gifts which I occa&s;ionally di&s;tribute among them, are for good offices not included in their actual duty, but which their per&s;onal affection for me leads them to do, beyond either my orders or expectations.'</P>

<HEAD><HI>DORINDA</HI> and <HI>ANTONY.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ON a beautiful day in the mid&s;t of &s;ummer, Mr. Wilkins promi&s;ed his two children, Dorinda and Antony, that he would take them to walk out with him in a very pretty garden, at &s;ome little di&s;tance from his hou&s;e. He went, therefore, into his dre&s;&s;ing-room to get ready, and de&s;ired the two children to wait for him in the parlour.</P>
<P>ANTONY, tran&s;ported with the plea&s;ure he expected from this little expedition, began run|ning and jumping about, giddy with joy, till the &s;kirt of his coat bru&s;hed down a very rare and curious flower, which his father was culti|vating with infinite care and attention, and which, at noon-day, in order to &s;helter from the burning heat of the &s;un, he had unfortu|nately removed into the room.</P>
<P>O brother! what have you done? cried Do|rinda, picking up the flower, which was broken off from the &s;tem.</P>
<P>SHE had it &s;till in her hand, when her father, having changed his dre&s;s, returned into the parlour.</P>
<P>WHAT does this mean, Dorinda? exclaimed Mr. Wilkins, very angrily; have you been ga|thering that flower, which you have &s;een me take &s;o much pains to cultivate, on purpo&s;e to pre&s;erve its &s;eed? Dear papa, cried Dorinda, trembling, don't be angry, pray!</P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="026643_0305_0FD10AA9976EBBC8">I &s;hall not be angry now, an&s;wered Mr. Wil|kins, recovering his temper; but le&s;t you &s;hould happen to have the &s;ame fancy for gathering flowers in the garden to which I am going, and which does not belong to me, you mu&s;t not be &s;urpri&s;ed that I think it nece&s;&s;ary to leave you at home.</P>
<P>DORINDA looked down, and &s;aid nothing; but Antony would no longer be &s;ilent. He approached his father, while his eyes &s;wam in tears, and &s;aid to him: It was not my &s;i&s;ter, papa, it was I that broke off the flo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r: &s;o it mu&s;t be for me to &s;tay at home; but pray let Dorinda go.</P>
<P>MR. Wilkins, touched by the ingenuou&s;ne&s;s of his children, and by the affection which they &s;hewed for each other, tenderly embraced them, and &s;aid: You are both of you my darlings, and you &s;hall go with me together.</P>
<P>DORINDA and Antony jumped for joy. They were then taken to the garden, where all the mo&s;t curious plants were pointed out to them. Mr. Wilkins ob&s;erved, with much &s;atisfaction, that while they were walking in the flower-beds, Dorinda pre&s;&s;ed her frock tight down on each &s;ide with her hands, while Antony h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d up the flaps of his coat under his arms, from the fear of doing any mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>THE flower which Mr. Wilkins had lo&s;t, would probably have given him &s;ome plea&s;ure; but he received infinitely more in viewing the fraternal tenderne&s;s, the candour and the di&s;|cretion which flouri&s;hed in his children.</P>

<HEAD>THE INSTRUCTIVE DISAPPOINTMENT.</HEAD>
<P>IN a beautiful morning in the month of June, Alexis had got him&s;elf ready to accompany his father upon a party of plea&s;ure, which had occupied all his hopes and thoughts for a fort-night before. Contrary to his u&s;ual cu&s;tom, he had ri&s;en very early, to ha&s;ten the preparations for his expedition: but ju&s;t at the in&s;tant, when he fancied he had arrived at the accompli&s;hment of his expectations, the &s;ky became dark, the clouds thickened and grew black, and a mo&s;t tempe&s;tuous wind beat down the branches of the trees, and blew up the du&s;t in whirlwinds. Alexis ran continually into the garden, to exa|mine the &s;ky; and then &s;kipt up &s;tairs, three &s;teps at a time, to con&s;ult the barometer&punc; but both the &s;ky and the barometer agreed in di&s;|appointing his wi&s;hes. Neverthele&s;s, he &s;crup<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed not to a&s;&s;ure his father they might go in &s;afety, that all the&s;e gloomy threats would di&s;per&s;e into nothing, that the weather would be finer than before, and that they ought to &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t out without lo&s;ing another moment.</P>
<P>MR. Pier&s;on, however, who had no blind confidence in the fore&s;ight of his &s;on, thought it wi&s;er to wait a little longer: and &s;oon after, the clouds &s;uddenly bur&s;t, and a torrent of rain
<PB N="306" REF="026643_0311_0FD10ABE17FB9E30">
fell upon the earth. Alexis, then, a&s;hamed as well as grieved, bur&s;t into a flood of tears, and refu&s;ed all con&s;olation.</P>
<P>THE rain continued till three o'clock in the afternoon: the clouds then di&s;per&s;ed, the &s;un recovered its &s;plendour, the &s;ky its &s;erenity, and all nature &s;eemed re&s;tored to the fre&s;hne&s;s of &s;pring. The temper of Alexis cleared, like the horizon, by degrees. His father took him out into the fields; where the calmne&s;s of the air, the warbling of the birds, the beauty of the meadows, and the &s;weet perfumes breathing every where around him, &s;oon brought back peace and good humour into his bo&s;om.</P>
<P>DO you ob&s;erve, &s;aid his father, how de|lightful a change has ju&s;t been made throughout the creation? Recollect but the gloomy face of things, which &s;o lately &s;addened us: the earth, you may remember, was parched, and opened in wide gaps from the long drought: the flow|ers lo&s;t their &s;weet &s;mell, and bent their droop|ing heads; all vegetation &s;eemed at an end. To what mu&s;t we attribute this &s;udden renewal of the beauties of nature? To the rain we have had, to-day, papa, an&s;wered Alexis: and, in pronouncing the&s;e words, he was in&s;tantly &s;truck him&s;elf with the folly of his behaviour, and the inju&s;tice of his repining. He coloured; and his father judged by his con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, that his own reflexions would &s;uffice to teach him, for the future, to &s;acrifice, without murmuring, his per&s;onal gratification, for the general good.</P>

<P>SHE enjoyed her liberty at fir&s;t with all po&s;&s;i|ble &s;pirit, and, for one whole hour, was perfect|ly happy: but, after that, &s;he began to grow weary, and every moment took from her &s;ome portion of her plea&s;ure.</P>

<SPEAKER>THE PRINCE.</SPEAKER>
<P>GOOD Heaven! reduced to &s;o much mi&s;ery by the war! How dreadful a &s;courge! how many whole families has it b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ought to ruin! It is better, however, they &s;hould &s;uffer from that than from me; and it was nece&s;&s;ity, not inclination, that made me take up arms.</P>
<STAGE><HI>(He ri&s;es, and after walking about &s;ome time, &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ps by the chair, and looks earne&s;tly at the Page.)</HI></STAGE>
<P>Sweet child, how ea&s;y and plea&s;ant his repo&s;e! it is Innocence it&s;elf in the arms of Sleep! He believes him&s;elf in the hou&s;e of a friend, where he has nothing to fear. Such ever is un&s;poilt nature.</P>
<STAGE>(<HI>He walks about again.</HI>)</STAGE>
<P>As to his mother&mdash;in truth I &s;hall not be inclined to do much for her, if &s;he re&s;embles this Captain. I will make &s;ome trial of her, that I may know her thoroughly; and then&mdash; but it will be time enough afterwards to deter|mine upon what &s;hall follow.</P>
<STAGE>(<HI>He leans upon the back of the chair; and while he is looking with kindne&s;s at the Page, he perceives a letter half way out of his pocket.</HI>)</STAGE>
<P>What is that? It &s;eems to be a letter.</P>
<STAGE>(He opens it, and looks at the conclu&s;ion.)</STAGE>
<P>"Your affectionate mother."</P>
<P><PB N="325" REF="026643_0330_0FD10AF4DC7B61C0">'Tis from his mother. Shall I read it? I &s;hould like to know her character. She will not have di&s;gui&s;ed it to this boy. I'll &s;ee what &s;he &s;ays to him.
<STAGE>(<HI>He reads.</HI>)</STAGE></P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>"My deare&s;t Son,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"The difficulty you find in writing, has not prevented your complying with my reque&s;t, and your letter is even longer than I had hoped to &s;ee it. This kind attention to me proves your du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y and your affection. I am very &s;en&s;ible of both, and I love you and thank you with my whole heart. You tell me you have been pre|&s;ented to the Prince; that he has had the good|ne&s;s to receive you into his &s;ervice; that he is the be&s;t and mo&s;t indulgent of ma&s;ters, and that you already love him very much."</P>
</LETTER>
<STAGE>(<HI>He looks at the Page.</HI>)</STAGE>
<P>And have you written thus to your mother? It is but doing, then, what I ought, to love in return, and to &s;hew you &s;ome token of my regard.</P>
<STAGE>(<HI>He reads again.</HI>)</STAGE>
<LETTER>
<P>"You have, indeed, rea&s;on to love him, my child; for, without his generous protection, what would be your lot in this world? You have lo&s;t your father; and though your mother is yet living, you are not the le&s;s to be pitied: fortune has put it out of her power to &s;atisfy your claims upon her; and this is the heavie&s;t of my misfortunes, and the bittere&s;t of all my afflictions. If I had only my&s;elf to think of, I could be calm in the wor&s;t of evils: but when my child's little form is pre&s;ent to my mind, my heart feels broken, and my tears will not be re&s;trained."</P>
</LETTER>
<P><PB N="326" REF="026643_0331_0FD10AF787295020">Much of tenderne&s;s, much of &s;en&s;ibility here, according to all appearance: and if &s;he is as excellent a woman as &s;he is a mother&mdash;and why &s;hould &s;he not?&mdash;She is, &s;he mu&s;t be! I cannot doubt it.</P>
<STAGE>(<HI>He reads again.</HI>)</STAGE>
<LETTER>
<P>"I know not how, my love, to point out to you the road of fortune as I wi&s;h to do; I am forced to continue &s;till in &s;olitude, and at a di&s;|tance:&mdash;but I will never cea&s;e to give you the be&s;t advice that my affection and under&s;tanding can dictate; and my voice, to the la&s;t moment that it can be heard, &s;hall always call upon, and conjure you to follow the paths of honour and virtue. I beg you, my child, as a further proof of that obedience you have con&s;tantly paid me, never to part with this letter, but to keep it always about you."</P>

</LETTER>
<P>How! has &s;he not another &s;on?</P>
<LETTER>
<P>"Remember that your behaving ill mu&s;t make her die with grief, and that you will then your&s;elf have pierced the heart that loves you more than all things upon earth."</P>

<P><PB N="327" REF="026643_0332_0FD10AF90412B1B0">She is &s;en&s;ible of his danger; and &s;he is right, for his &s;ituation is very un&s;afe. She ought not to have &s;ent him hither.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>"I &s;peak not from &s;u&s;picion or doubt; your conduct has given me no occa&s;ion. No, my dear child, no: your brother, indeed, has co&s;t me many tears; but you are more kind and con&s;iderate to the tender apprehen&s;ions of your mother."</P>
</LETTER>
<P>So, &s;o, this is the elde&s;t, the En&s;ign: I mu&s;t know more of this.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>"You have ever been obedient and re&s;pectful; I acknowledge it with tears of joy. Continue always thus good my &s;on, and become an hone&s;t and worthy man; and then your mother, how|ever poor, however unhappy &s;he may be, will &s;oon learn to forget both her poverty and her misfortunes in her gratitude!"</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Excellent! I am much plea&s;ed with her &s;en|timents. Sorrow &s;eems to have enlarged her &s;oul, in&s;tead of &s;inking it.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>"You tell me, in your po&s;t&s;cript, that all your companions wear watches. I &s;ee you want one al&s;o, though you break off there, and try to di&s;gui&s;e your wi&s;hes. This forbearance delights me: I am only grieved I cannot reward it. You know, my love, that I cannot, and therefore you will excu&s;e. I am &s;ummoned to the capital upon &s;ome affairs of importance, and my journey to it will &s;wallow up all the little money I have yet remaining. It is, however, a nece&s;&s;ary expence, and not to be avoided: but a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf that I will do the utmo&s;t in my power to &s;atisfy your de&s;ire in a &s;hort time. Were I to deny my&s;elf every thing, I could not

bear that my heart's dear child &s;hould want any encouragement to virtue. I &s;hall hope, ere long, to &s;ee you again, and I am&mdash;your affectionate mother."</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Excellent mother! how worthy a better lot! I will keep this letter, and &s;hew it to my wife. But no; 'tis this boy's only trea&s;ure; and why &s;hould I rob him of it?</P>
<STAGE>(<HI>He puts the letter back into the Page's pocket.</HI>)</STAGE>
<P>With what tranquility he continues to &s;leep! Heaven, they &s;ay, prepares happine&s;s for its children while they are at re&s;t. This, at lea&s;t, is true with him, for his fortune is now made.</P>
