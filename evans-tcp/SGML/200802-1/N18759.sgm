<Q><BIBL><HI>PSALM LXXVIII. 5, 6, 7.</HI></BIBL>
<P>He e&s;tabli&s;hed a te&s;timony in Jacob, and appointed a law in I&s;rael, which he commanded our fathers, that they &s;hould make them known to their children. That the generation to come might know them, even the children which &s;hould be born, who &s;hould ari&s;e and declare them to their children. That they might &s;et their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE importance of the ri&s;ing generation, has engaged the attention of the wi&s;e and good, in all ages. Experienced old men have ardently de&s;ired the be&s;t good of po&s;terity. Patriarchs, prophets, and apo&s;tles have laboured to promote it. The in&s;pired writer of this P&s;alm, impre&s;&s;ed deeply with the &s;ubject, calls on us to attend to the words of his mouth, even the words which had been received from the fathers which, &s;aid he, we will not hide from their children, "&s;hewing to the generations to come the prai&s;es of the Lord, and his &s;trength and his wonderful works."</P>
<P>THE words of our text contain a &s;ummary of God's law and te&s;timony which he appointed for his people, to be tran&s;mitted to &s;ucceeding generations; that the knowledge and practice of true religion might be pre&s;erved to the end of the world. It will not be doubted that this &s;ubject claims our mo&s;t &s;erious attention, on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="024381_0004_0FC63968120AED50">WE &s;hall attempt an illu&s;tration of it by con|&s;idering the law and te&s;timony which God hath e&s;tabli&s;hed in his church. And</P>
<P>THE great importance of tran&s;mitting them to po&s;terity.</P>
<P N="1">I. WE are to con&s;ider the law and te&s;timony which God hath e&s;tabli&s;hed in his church.</P>
<P>WERE we to confine our views to the time of the P&s;almi&s;t, nothing more would be compri&s;ed than tho&s;e &s;acred books of the old te&s;tament&punc; which were compleat in his day. The words of our text have a manife&s;t reference to the writings of Mo&s;es, but they may be more exten&s;ively ap|plied. God's law and te&s;timony was a progre&s;&s;ive revelation, through the &s;everal periods, from the fir&s;t age of the world, till the completion of the &s;acred canon. Before the deluge, and in the days of the patriarchs, Noah and Abraham, only a few revelations were given to the church.&mdash;Large additions were made in the time of Mo&s;es. In &s;ucceeding ages, the will of God was further re|vealed to man, by his prophets and other in&s;pired me&s;&s;engers, till the &s;criptures of the old te&s;tament were compleated. And, at the appointed time, the Divine Redeemer appeared, in our world, and having fini&s;hed his labours and &s;ufferings on earth, and a&s;cended to glory, he &s;hed down the Holy Gho&s;t on his apo&s;tles and others, to commit to writing the whole New Te&s;tament for the benefit of his church, to the end of the world.&mdash;Thus, "Holy men of God, &s;pake as they were moved by the Holy Gho&s;t<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">1 Peter i. 21.</NOTE>," And, "God, who at &s;undry times and in divers manners, &s;pake to the fathers,
<PB N="7" REF="024381_0005_0FC6396C3A2C1318">
by the prophets, hath in the&s;e la&s;t days &s;poken un|to us by his Son<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Heb. i. 1, 2.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>HENCE, we are to under&s;tand, the law and te&s;|timony of God, in the days of the P&s;almi&s;t, to compri&s;e all parts of divine revelation then given to the church. To us they imply the whole canon of holy &s;cripture. The&s;e &s;acred writings are "given by in&s;piration of God, and are profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for in|&s;truction in righteou&s;ne&s;s. That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furni&s;hed unto all good works<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. iii. 16, 17.</NOTE>." But they, "principally, teach, what man is to believe, concerning God, and what duty God requires of man." Proofs, of the being and perfections of God, &s;urround us in his works. "The heavens declare his glory, and the firma|ment &s;heweth his handy work. Day unto day ut|tereth &s;peech, and night unto night &s;heweth know|ledge<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm xix. 1, 2.</NOTE>." And "the invi&s;ible things of him, from the creation of the world are clearly &s;een, being under&s;tood by the things which are made, even his eternal power and Godhead<NOTE N="&lpara;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm xix. 7.</NOTE>." But "the law of the Lord is perfect, converting the &s;oul. The te&s;timony of the Lord is &s;ure, making wi&s;e the &s;imple<NOTE N="&Verbar;&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Rom. i. 20.</NOTE>." It is from the written word that we are to learn in the fulle&s;t manner, the divine perfections and will, and without which we are utterly in the dark as to the door of hope for &s;in|ners, and the way in which &s;alvation is attain|able.</P>
<P>THE law and te&s;timony of God in&s;truct us in all needful truth. In the&s;e, we are taught in the
<PB N="8" REF="024381_0006_0FC63972EA49B6D0">
cleare&s;t manner, the natural and moral perfecti|ons of God.&mdash;The creation of all things, by the word of his power.&mdash;The relations of man to his Creator, and to his fellow creatures.&mdash;The origi|nal &s;tate of innocence and felicity, and the nature and extent of God's moral government.&mdash;Tho&s;e divine writings, teach us the &s;ad and inexcu&s;able apo&s;tacy of the fir&s;t man, and the con&s;equent &s;tate of &s;in and condemnation, to him and his po&s;terity. Here we learn that my&s;terious glory of the divine exi&s;tence.&mdash;<HI>A Trinity in Unity.</HI>&mdash;From this we are led, in the progre&s;&s;ive revelation, to a view of the &s;econd per&s;on in the adorable Trinity, as the Redeemer of man.&mdash;The holy &s;criptures inform us of "the coun&s;el of peace," or the plan of re|demption fixed in the purpo&s;e of God, and accom|pli&s;hed in the per&s;on of, THE WORD. The great my&s;tery of godline&s;s is here di&s;played. "God was manife&s;t in the fle&s;h, ju&s;tified in the &s;pirit, &s;een of angels, preached to the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory." The work of redemption, is evidently, the greate&s;t of God's works revealed to man. To this all his other works tend, and in this they centre. For this rea&s;on a principal part of the &s;acred &s;criptures are employed in treating on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>"OF this &s;alvation, the prophets enquired and &s;earched diligently, who prophe&s;ied of the grace which &s;hould come unto us; &s;earching what, or what manner of time, the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t which was in them did &s;ignify, when it te&s;tified before hand, the &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t, and the glory which &s;hould follow."</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="024381_0007_0FC6397528A430A8">THE apo&s;tles were "witne&s;&s;es of the &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t," and they "determined to know no|thing among their hearers, &s;ave Je&s;us Chri&s;t and him crucified."</P>
<P>IN connexion with the per&s;on and work of Chri&s;t, and redemption by his blood; the law and te&s;timony reveal to us the work of the holy &s;pirit, in the application of redemption, and the way in which &s;inners become united to Chri&s;t, and partakers in the &s;aving benefits of his death. Here we are taught the nece&s;&s;ity of "repentance to|wards God, and faith towards our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t." That without faith, it is impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e God,"&mdash;That "he who believeth &s;hall be &s;aved, but he who believeth not, &s;hall be damn|ed." That men are "ju&s;tified by faith without the deeds of the law"&mdash;"Ju&s;tified freely by the grace of God, through the redemption which is in Je&s;us Chri&s;t." From the&s;e oracles, we al&s;o learn, that the faith of God's elect, is connected with a life of chri&s;tian holine&s;s, or obedience to all divine commands,&mdash;that "tho&s;e, only who do God's commandments, are ble&s;&s;ed, have right to the tree of life, and &s;hall enter in through the gates into the city."</P>
<P>ALL go&s;pel in&s;titutions and ordinances belong to the divine te&s;timony, and are enjoined in the holy &s;criptures.&mdash;The religious and devout ob&s;erva|tion of them is an important part of chri&s;tian holi|ne&s;s, and tho&s;e who fear God, count them among their greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings.&mdash;Private and &s;ocial prayer to God, and other branches of his wor&s;hip&mdash;The ob&s;ervation of the Lord's day.&mdash;Of the chri&s;tian &s;acraments.&mdash;Bapti&s;m, and the Lord's Supper, are
<PB N="10" REF="024381_0008_0FC63977369FA480">
not only enjoined as duties, but granted as privi|leges.&mdash;In connexion with tho&s;e is the in&s;titution of the chri&s;tian church and evangelical mini&s;try.&mdash;The office and work of the mini&s;try, and the order, unity and di&s;cipline of the church, are ap|pointed by God, "for the perfecting the &s;aints, for the edifying the body of Chri&s;t, till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the know|ledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the mea&s;ure of the &s;tature of the fulne&s;s of Chri&s;t."</P>
<P>THE holy &s;criptures enjoin the duties of &s;en&s;ible dependence on God.&mdash;Submi&s;&s;ion in adver&s;ity, and of humility and thankfulne&s;s in pro&s;perity. They teach us in whatever &s;tate we are, "therewith to be content," and furni&s;h rules by which if duly applied, we &s;hall "know how to be aba&s;ed and how to abound&mdash;to be full and to be hungry."&mdash;They in&s;truct us to be as &s;trangers and pilgrims on earth, to lay up trea&s;ure in heaven, and endure as &s;eeing him who is invi&s;ible. In all conditions, and through all changes, living or dying; the word of God furni&s;hes a rich &s;upply of needful truth: that the good man may &s;ay with thankful prai&s;e, "thy te&s;timonies, O Lord, are wonderful, therefore doth my &s;oul keep them." "The en|trance of thy word giveth life, it giveth under|&s;tanding to the &s;imple."</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be remembered that God's law and te&s;|timony contain all nece&s;&s;ary rules of duty in our various relations to each other. There we may learn our duty and happine&s;s, as hu&s;bands and wives, parents and children, and in all other do|me&s;tic relations.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="024381_0009_0FC6397979F65548">THE word of God al&s;o, inculcates the love of our neighbor, and teaches us to re&s;pect all men as &s;uch. It requires us to "love our enemies, and do good to tho&s;e who hate us, to pray for tho&s;e who de&s;pitefully u&s;e us, and per&s;ecute us."&mdash;To "bear one another's burdens, relieve the di&s;tre&s;|&s;ed, vi&s;it the fatherle&s;s and widows in their afflic|tions," and be "ready to every good work."</P>
<P>THIS &s;acred book not only teaches men the love of their country, but in&s;pires them with that true patrioti&s;m which &s;eeks its be&s;t intere&s;t and pro|duces all becoming exertions to promote it.&mdash;And that in &s;uch a manner as to advance the good of de&s;erving individuals, and to coincide with the true intere&s;t of other countries, and of mankind.&mdash;We mu&s;t not omit to ob&s;erve, that the love of our country, required in the holy &s;criptures, is &s;uch as is &s;ub&s;ervient to the glory of God. To this, all its exertions tend, and in it they are ultimately ab&s;orbed.</P>
<P>THE divine word teaches us to &s;pend life in preparation for death and heaven.&mdash;It a&s;&s;ures us of the con&s;cious exi&s;tence of tho&s;e, who are ab&s;ent from the body&mdash;Of the re&s;urrection, both of the ju&s;t and unju&s;t&mdash;Of the final judgment, and the ne|verending ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of the righteous, and puni&s;h|ment of the wicked, and it pre&s;ents the mo&s;t awful and endearing motives to per&s;uade us to live un|der the governing influence of tho&s;e great and everla&s;ting realities; and it offers &s;uch divine &s;up|ports, in afflictions and death, as if duly applied, will enable us to walk through the valley of the &s;hadow of death, and fear no evil, and in the lan|guage of thankful exultation to cry, "O death,

where is thy &s;ting. O grave, where is thy vic|tory!</P>
<P N="2">II. THE great importance of tran&s;mitting to po&s;terity, the divine law and te&s;timony will ap|pear from the following con&s;iderations.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. THE worth of po&s;terity.</P>
<P>THE importance of man will deeply impre&s;s the mind which attentively con&s;iders it. The pre|&s;ent and future exi&s;tence are, both of them, high|ly intere&s;ting, but e&s;pecially the latter. The va|rious endowments of the mind of man, in connex|ion with his immortality, render his exi&s;tence im|portant, in the highe&s;t degree.&mdash;Such is the worth of the human &s;oul, that in the e&s;timate of unerring wi&s;dom, it is not to be exchanged for the whole world<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Math. xvi. 26.</NOTE>. This worth is &s;ummarily compri&s;ed in the capacity for po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing and diffu&s;ing happine&s;s, or which i&s;&s;ues in the &s;ame, for union to God and his kingdom. Each individual of the pre&s;ent and future ages will fill a place in the &s;cale of beings, through never-ending duration: important in eve|ry period of his exi&s;tence; how important then in the whole of it! The pre&s;ent infant of a day, is a being of immortality, and will act a part which will materially effect the felicity, not of him&s;elf only, but of the whole moral &s;y&s;tem, and that for|ever.</P>
<P>SUCH con&s;iderations &s;how the importance of man, and the worth of po&s;terity; but it is &s;till more &s;trongly marked in the agency of God with re&s;pect to our race. This world is evidently cre|ated to be an habitation for man, the various or|ders of inferior creatures, were made and ap|pointed
<PB N="13" REF="024381_0011_0FC6397C4BD678C8">
for his &s;ervice; and the whole cour&s;e of events from the fir&s;t creation, is directed with re|ference to him. But what &s;wallows up all other con&s;iderations on this &s;ubject, is, <HI>the work of re|demption!</HI> to this, nothing can be added to evince the importance of man, and the worth of po&s;teri|ty: the whole is expre&s;&s;ed in &s;aying that "<HI>in due time, Chri&s;t died for the ungodly</HI><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Romans v. 6.</NOTE>." and that, "<HI>God &s;o loved the world, that he gave his only be|gotten Son, that who&s;oever believeth in him &s;hould not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting life</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">John iii, 16.</NOTE>."</P>
<P N="2">2d. THE felicity and u&s;efulne&s;s of po&s;terity de|pends on a becoming regulation of their principles and manners. This con&s;i&s;ts in their receiving God's te&s;timonies, and reducing them to practice. The&s;e te&s;timonies enjoin the &s;everal branches of that religion which is &s;ummarily contained in the love of God and man. Without which they can be neither happy nor u&s;eful<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">This a&s;&s;ertion re&s;pects only the nature and tendency of moral di&s;po&s;itions, and is by no means to be under&s;tood in oppo&s;ition to the important truth, that God by his wi&s;e and holy agency, &s;o over-rules the wickedne&s;s of his enemies, and counteracts its nature and tendency as to render it &s;ub&s;ervient to the purpo&s;e of his in|finite wi&s;dom and holine&s;s, and thus, by "educing good from ill," he cau&s;es the wrath of man to prai&s;e him, and the remainder of wrath, he graciou&s;ly re&s;trains.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THAT each of the&s;e depend on &s;uch di&s;po&s;itions will appear to be true, to whatever particular we apply the ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>WHAT but mutual affection con&s;titutes that har|mony of minds which is termed friend&s;hip?&mdash;Such union of hearts is the &s;ource and band of dome&s;tic felicity: if this be wanting, how deplo|rably mi&s;erable is the neare&s;t of human connex|ions
<PB N="14" REF="024381_0012_0FC63983B18BDA68">
even in the mid&s;t of all other earthly good. But where this is found it not only gives worth to all other enjoyments, but &s;upplies their ab&s;ence, and gives truly &s;ublime &s;atisfaction in the mid&s;t of calamity. All family relations, and other &s;ocial connexions are found to be happy in proportion to this, and the rever&s;e if it be wanting.</P>
<P>THE intere&s;ts of &s;ociety at large are proportion|ably effected, and depend on the union of its mem|bers, and where this in any good mea&s;ure exi&s;ts, the benevolent &s;pectator will behold it with plea|&s;ure, and exultingly cry out, "Behold how good and how plea&s;ant it is for brethren to dwell to|gether in unity."&mdash;But as man is a being of im|mortality, and a member of that va&s;t &s;ociety, com|pri&s;ing all intelligent beings, his felicity and u&s;e|fulne&s;s are principally to be mea&s;ured in relation to that.&mdash;When viewed in this connexion, how intere&s;ting is the pre&s;ent &s;ubject!&mdash;Tho&s;e who&s;e principles and manners are formed to the bu&s;ine&s;s and enjoyments of God's kingdom, are prepared for the noble&s;t exi&s;tence. It is by the love of God and man they are thus formed. Without this their noble endowments will be employed in a manner &s;trongly tending to the injury of others, and with regret to them&s;elves. This tendency will be ef|fectual and everla&s;ting.</P>
<P>THE only po&s;&s;ible method of e&s;cape from this evil is in receiving God's te&s;timonies and reducing them to practice.&mdash;And in this way only will they live in the mo&s;t u&s;eful manner to others on earth, and be actively u&s;eful in heaven.</P>
<P N="3">3d. THAT po&s;terity may be thus u&s;eful and hap|py, they mu&s;t be in&s;tructed in God's te&s;timonies.
<PB N="15" REF="024381_0013_0FC639868521A110">
It belongs indeed to God only, to form the heart to the love of divine truth. Paul may plant, and Apollos water, the be&s;t means may be applied in vain, unle&s;s attended with the ble&s;&s;ing of God. However, it is his good plea&s;ure to ble&s;s his own in&s;titutions. We are as totally dependent on him for the health and &s;upport of the body. Our dai|ly bread is the gift of his bounty, no le&s;s than the food for the &s;oul. But who will infer from thence, that we are not to apply the appointed means, to obtain food for our&s;elves and our families? The duty is not le&s;s evident, and is much more impor|tant in regard to the &s;oul. A proper &s;en&s;e of our dependence on God, that our po&s;terity may be formed to be u&s;eful and happy, will lead to a faithful application of the appointed means.</P>
<P>AN acquaintance with the word of God is the great appointed medium of that felicity and u&s;e|fulne&s;s which is to be &s;ought for po&s;terity; this is to be obtained by in&s;truction. For many rea&s;ons it is important that this in&s;truction &s;hould be given in youth: the mind is then mo&s;t &s;u&s;ceptible of la&s;t|ing impre&s;&s;ions; habits of ignorance and ob&s;tina|cy are not formed, at mo&s;t they have not attained the firmne&s;s of long indulgence; bad example has not exerted its baneful influence to &s;trengthen them in the way of death; inveterate cu&s;tom has not fixed them in the walks of vice, and rendered them callous to the truths of religion, and the re|mon&s;trances of con&s;cience.</P>
<P>SAD experience evinces, that few who have &s;pent their youth in vice and folly, are brought to re|pentance and reformation in advanced age. Of the&s;e few were the ca&s;es examined, it would pro|bably
<PB N="16" REF="024381_0014_0FC6398AB4011858">
be found that in mo&s;t of them, the founda|tion was laid by early in&s;truction. Innumerable have been the in&s;tances of its &s;ucce&s;s. How many of God's people have ble&s;&s;ed him for the in&s;truc|tion of their youth, and that from their childhood they have "known the holy &s;criptures, which are able to make them wi&s;e to &s;alvation, through faith in Chri&s;t Je&s;us."&mdash;Admitting that a few have been made wi&s;e to &s;alvation who never enjoyed this ine&s;timable privilege, (for we rejoice in the unlimited &s;overeignty of God, and that he hath mercy on whom he will have mercy:) yet how di&s;proportioned are their means to be u&s;eful and happy, and how deeply mu&s;t they lament the want of that early and pious in&s;truction recommended in our text! and how &s;uperior the advantages of tho&s;e who have enjoyed it!</P>
<P>BUT alas! how va&s;t are the numbers of tho&s;e, who live and die in extreme ignorance of God and religion; not only in the regions of unenlighten|ed pagani&s;m, but even in the mid&s;t of tho&s;e who enjoy the go&s;pel! Their untaught childhood and youth have prepared them to de&s;pi&s;e religious knowledge in riper years. Habits of vice have induced them to add contempt to ignorance, till they have increa&s;ed the number of tho&s;e "fools who de&s;pi&s;e wi&s;dom and in&s;truction, make a mock at &s;in, and die for want of wi&s;dom."</P>

<P>SCRIPTURE hi&s;tory abounds with facts in confir|mation of the pre&s;ent truth.

Tho&s;e, who were the principal actors in my &s;et|tlement, are either &s;ilent in death, or &s;trug|gling with the late&s;t calamities of declining life. Many of them acted their part well, and their ever dear and honoured names are "like preci|ous ointment" to po&s;terity. Much is the debt of gratitude from their children. You have now &s;ucceeded to their place&mdash;to di&s;charge that debt, you mu&s;t fill it up u&s;efully. On this condition, they will not be a&s;hamed to own you, as their children, hereafter. That you may thus do, and be ble&s;&s;ed, &s;uffer the word of exhortation from him who "lives if ye &s;tand fa&s;t in the Lord."</P>
<P>YOU will &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider, that the intere&s;ts of this people and of future generations are de|volved on you, and that you are to give account to God for the important betru&s;tment. That you may do it with joy, be plea&s;ed to remember and practi&s;e the following particulars.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="024381_0029_0FC639B302DE3CD8"><HI>Fir&s;t of all,</HI> "Acquaint your&s;elves with God and be at peace with him." To this you are invited, not only by all the motives which re|&s;pect your&s;elves, but al&s;o on account of your children and po&s;terity: for what rea&s;onable hope can be indulged of fidelity, in the education of your children, if you are not faithful to your|&s;elves?</P>
<P>LET it be your fir&s;t care then, to have ju&s;t views of the religion of the bible, and reduce it to practice. True religion as exhibited in the &s;criptures, and exi&s;ting in good men, is a beau|tiful and con&s;i&s;tent whole; con&s;i&s;ting of various parts, harmoniou&s;ly uniting, and mutually illu&s;|trating each other. It is doctrinal, experiment|al, and practical, and in each of the&s;e, the con|nection and dependence, of the parts, on each other, add &s;trength, con&s;i&s;tence and beauty to the whole, and prove it to be every way wor|thy of God, and &s;uitable to man. Let this di|vine religion be exemplified in your profe&s;&s;ion and your lives.</P>
<P>NEXT to your duty, as individuals, I would intreat you to do honour to chri&s;tianity, as hu&s;|bands and wives. This will be effected, by living in that conjugal harmony, for which there is every inducement, from per&s;onal and dome&s;t|ic felicity&mdash;from the intere&s;ts of po&s;terity&mdash;from this world and the world to come. Then you will "dwell together according to knowledge, and as fellow heirs of the grace of life, and your prayers will not be hindered."<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">1 Peter iii. 7.</NOTE> In this way, you may be like that excellent pair, of whom
<PB N="32" REF="024381_0030_0FC639BA74425F48">
we have this honourable te&s;timony, "that they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blamele&s;s."<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">Luke i. 6.</NOTE> Many are the branches of genu|ine chri&s;tianity, or ways of exemplifying its ex|cellent nature&mdash;they are corre&s;pondent to all our relations to God, and to our fellow-creatures, to &s;ociety on earth, to this world and the world to come. A right apprehen&s;ion, of its leading principles, will be abundantly u&s;eful in directing your judgment, and influencing your practice at all times, and in all conditions.</P>
<P>OUR particular attention is now called to that only, which is the &s;ubject of this di&s;cour&s;e; The education of po&s;terity.</P>
<P>MAY I not &s;ay, in your behalf and my own, that "we have no greater joy than to hear that our children walk in the truth." To parents, as members of &s;ociety, and as chri&s;tians; their edu|cation is a leading object. We have received God's te&s;timonies from our parents, let us com|mit them to our children. We are e&s;pecially called to this, on account of their dangerous &s;tate, from the circum&s;tances of the age in which they live. For though we &s;hould not "inquire wi&s;ely in a&s;king why the former days were better than the&s;e,"<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Eccle&s;ia&s;tes vii. 10.</NOTE> as human nature and the world, are &s;ub&s;tantially, the &s;ame in all ages; there are, however, occa&s;ional differences, important to be regarded in the education of youth. You are not in&s;en&s;ible, that the pre&s;ent age has the marks of degeneracy in &s;everal particulars, which in|fluence the manners of the people, the order of
<PB N="33" REF="024381_0031_0FC639BFA8F3F688">
&s;ociety, and the intere&s;ts of religion. The wor|&s;hip of God, in families, and in public, and the religious ob&s;ervation of the Lord's Day, were ge|nerally practi&s;ed by our fathers, and with great de|cency. But what a &s;ad rever&s;e has taken place in our day! Numbers, it is to be feared, are not well grounded in the fir&s;t principles of chri&s;tianity, and are in a condition to become an early prey to &s;e|ducers, who would betray them into fal&s;e religi|ons, or even to none.</P>
<P>THIS may, no doubt be traced to &s;everal influ|encing cau&s;es.&mdash;But may we not conclude, that one of the greate&s;t, is the criminal neglect of ma|ny parents in the education of their children, and their own bad examples? The children of &s;uch fa|milies have an unhappy influence on tho&s;e who are better taught, and the contagion of vice and irre|ligion is widely extended; for "man is born like the wild a&s;&s;es colt<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Job xi. 12.</NOTE>," and human nature tends to evil.</P>
<P>THIS calamitous event of our day, adds a new and important motive to all that have been named, for parental fidelity in the education of children. Their danger is uncommonly great, and we are at lea&s;t, in part accountable for it.&mdash;How highly doth it concern us, to improve the remainder of our life, faithfully, for the good of our children. We wi&s;h they may grow up to be u&s;eful and happy in family connections, to be good members of &s;ocie|ty, to &s;erve their generation, to honor their Ma|ker and Redeemer, tran&s;mit to their children the principles of virtue and piety, and be prepared for heaven.&mdash;That none of the&s;e important objects
<PB N="34" REF="024381_0032_0FC639C21CCC1DB8">
may be lo&s;t through our neglect, we &s;hould "bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord;" that they may know and practice God's te&s;timonies, "and ari&s;e and declare them to their children; that they may &s;et their hope in God, and not forget his works, but keep his command|ments. Let the&s;e things be in our hearts, that we may teach them diligently to our children; and talk of them when we &s;et in our hou&s;es, and when we walk by the way, and when we lie down, and when we ri&s;e up." Our in&s;tructions mu&s;t be adapted to their age, capacities, and other cir|cum&s;tances. They mu&s;t be &s;upported by the ex|ertions of parental authority and love; but above all <HI>by our examples and prayers.</HI> We mu&s;t devote them to God from their earlie&s;t infancy, and per|petuate the dedication by prayer, as long as we live, that the God of our pious progenitors may be their God; and we mu&s;t be in all re&s;pects, as far as po&s;&s;ible, what we would wi&s;h them to be. We mu&s;t walk before them in the path of wi&s;|dom, which leads to u&s;efulne&s;s and felicity on earth, and to glory in Heaven.&mdash;Among the ma|ny inducements to this, it will be u&s;eful to recol|lect the in&s;tructions and example of our pious fa|thers; the&s;e mu&s;t, in &s;ome in&s;tances at lea&s;t, be fre&s;h in our minds. Such recollections mu&s;t ex|ceedingly &s;often the heart, and the impre&s;&s;ions of the&s;e truths will be proportionably deep. What child or parent ever read the following addre&s;s of the wi&s;e man to his children, without the tender|e&s;t emotions? "Hear ye children the in&s;truction of a father, and attend to know under&s;tanding. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> give you good doctrines, for&s;ake you not

<P>THE happy influence of &s;uch parental education, was early di&s;played in his choice of wi&s;dom, in preference to riches and long life<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">1 Kings, iii. 1&mdash;14.</NOTE>.

<P N="2">II. To the children and youth.</P>
<P>A FEW words will compri&s;e the &s;ub&s;tance of what I would wi&s;h to be impre&s;&s;ed on your hearts. I have little to offer which can be called new; but it is not le&s;s weighty and intere&s;ting for being old. The text and &s;ubject are not more impor|tant to your parents, than to you. If their obli|gations and motives, re&s;pecting your education, are &s;uch as have been named, yours are propor|tionable

to receive their in&s;tructions, and reduce them to practice. It is for your &s;akes, and be|cau&s;e your intere&s;t is &s;o deeply involved, that they are thus obliged. On this depends your felicity and u&s;efulne&s;s in this and the future life.</P>
<P>THE price in your hand to get wi&s;dom is ex|ceedingly precious; but its continuance is uncer|tain, and at be&s;t it is &s;hort.&mdash;If you follow the dic|tates of a virtuous and truly good education, you will be u&s;eful and happy on earth, and ble&s;&s;ed in heaven&mdash;God will be your friend and protector here, and your portion forever. But if you de&s;|pi&s;e the in&s;tructions of parental piety, it is at your peril; you will be marked for wretchedne&s;s and reproach on earth, and for aggravated mi|&s;ery in hell. And you will "mourn at the la&s;t, and &s;ay, how have we hated in&s;truction, and our hearts de&s;pi&s;ed reproof? And have not obeyed the voice of our teachers, nor inclined our ear to them that in&s;tructed us<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Proverbs v. 11, 12, 13.</NOTE>."&mdash;That this may not be your awful doom, <HI>Remember</HI> that you are the creatures of God&mdash;born for immortality&mdash;ruined by &s;in, and mu&s;t partake of the go&s;pel &s;alvation, or be ruined forever.&mdash;Your continu|ance on earth at mo&s;t will be &s;hort, much &s;horter than you can, now, readily conceive. The flight of time, is exceedingly rapid. How &s;oon have the la&s;t thirty years pa&s;&s;ed away? and are forever gone!&mdash;what changes have the&s;e thirty years produced?&mdash;tho&s;e who were then the pa|rents of the congregation are generally gone&mdash;we have &s;ucceeded in their place, and you in ours.&mdash;More than five hundred, of all ages, have
