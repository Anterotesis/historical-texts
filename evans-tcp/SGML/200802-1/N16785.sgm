<BIBL>ROMANS xiii. 3, 4.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? Do that which is good, and thou &s;halt have prai&s;e of the &s;ame: For he is the mini&s;ter of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the &s;word in vain; for he is the mini&s;ter of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THERE are particular occurrences, in providence, which are peculiarly fit|ted to turn our attention to the nature and im|portance of civil government, and lead us to prize and revere it as a divine in&s;titution. The pre&s;ent affecting and melancholy occa|&s;ion is one of tho&s;e, and we are now called upon humbly to adore and ble&s;s God, that there is a way, of his own appointment, in
<PB N="4" REF="021599_0004_0FB419859264FFE8">
which the world may rid it&s;elf of tho&s;e who, by their crimes and violence, have made them&s;elves intolerable to &s;ociety. That there is a way in which this may be done, with the divine approbation, is evident from the words of our text. For God has appointed civil rulers to bear his &s;word, to avenge the wrongs of &s;ociety, and to execute wrath upon evil doers.</P>
<P>But it has been a que&s;tion, with &s;ome, what tho&s;e crimes are for which capital puni&s;hments may be inflicted. Many have imagined that nothing but <HI>murder</HI> or <HI>&s;hedding of man's blood</HI> might be puni&s;hed with death by the civil ruler.</P>
<P>A little attention to the &s;acred writings may convince us of the contrary. Happy for the world that, even in matters of civil gov|ernment, we are favoured with &s;o excellent a guide.</P>
<P>We find that, under the Mo&s;aic law, ma|ny crimes, be&s;ides that of murder, were made capital. And, as the <HI>civil government</HI> of the Hebrews was far more excellent than that of any other nation, being framed and in&s;tituted by infinite wi&s;dom; it may well be patterned after by civil legi&s;lators: And &s;uch of its laws and in&s;titutions as difference of circum|&s;tances will admir, be adopted by other na|tions.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="021599_0005_0FB41986F9AC7EF0">
By the Jewi&s;h law, a variety of crimes were puni&s;hable with death: Such as&mdash;<HI>Cur&s;ing, or &s;miting father or mother,</HI> Exod, xxi. 15, 17. that di&s;obedience to authority might be nip|ped in the bad.&mdash;<HI>Cau&s;ing their children to pa&s;s through the fire, and offering them to Moloch. Adultery, Ince&s;t, Lying with a bea&s;t,</HI> &s;ee Levit. xx. <HI>Bla&s;phemy,</HI> Levit. xxiv. 16. <HI>Idolatry,</HI> Deut. xvii. 5. <HI>Ravi&s;hing,</HI> or <HI>Rapes,</HI> Deut. xxii. 25. If a <HI>Thief,</HI> found breaking up in the night, was put to immediate death, he that killed him was not e&s;teemed a criminal, Exod. xxii. 2. <HI>Witchcraft,</HI> which &s;ome learned men have &s;uppo&s;ed nothing materially different from tho&s;e ba&s;e arts of fortune telling which have been impo&s;ed on the credulity of mankind, and affronted common &s;en&s;e, in almo&s;t every age and nation, was to be pun|i&s;hed with death, Exod. xxii. 18.</P>
<P>If &s;uch a variety of crimes were to be pun|i&s;hed with death, according to the <HI>Mo&s;aic law,</HI> it would be &s;trange that nothing but murder might be made capital by the laws of other nations. For there is great rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that none of the&s;e crimes, not even murder it&s;elf, were made capital, by the Jew|i&s;h law, <HI>becau&s;e they were &s;ins again&s;t God;</HI> but <HI>becau&s;e they were &s;ins again&s;t &s;ociety.</HI> Sins <HI>as again&s;t God,</HI> he him&s;elf will puni&s;h. He on|ly knows their malignity, and their de&s;ert;
<PB N="6" REF="021599_0006_0FB41988780896D8">
and he only can inflict an adequate puni&s;h|ment. Accordingly, the apo&s;tle &s;ays, Rom. xii. 19. <Q>Dearly beloved, avenge not your&s;elves, but rather give place unto wrath; for it is written, <HI>Vengeance is mine: I will repay, &s;aith the Lord.</HI></Q> But, that the peace of the community may be &s;ecured and pre&s;erved, God has put his &s;word of ju&s;|tice into the hands of the civil magi&s;trate, to avenge the wrongs done to &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Even <HI>Idolatry</HI> and <HI>Bla&s;phemy,</HI> there is rea|&s;on to believe, were not made capital <HI>becau&s;e they were &s;ins again&s;t God,</HI> but <HI>because they were trea&s;on again&s;t the &s;tate.</HI> As God was their <HI>civil king and head,</HI> the&s;e &s;ins &s;truck at the fundamental laws of their &s;ociety; and were a direct attempt to &s;ubvert their govern|ment. The Hebrews had cho&s;en Jehovah for their &s;ole and &s;upreme ruler and king, and had &s;worn allegiance to him. They had no other form of <HI>civil government</HI> than what had been framed and given them by Jehovah, and voluntarily cho&s;en and adopted by them|&s;elves. It is hence evident, that idolatry and bla&s;phemy were a renunciation of their allegiance to their &s;overeign, and trea&s;on again&s;t their king.</P>
<P>And, that even the&s;e crimes were puni&s;hed with death, not &s;o much becau&s;e they were &s;ins again&s;t <HI>God,</HI> as again&s;t the <HI>civil commu|nity,</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="021599_0007_0FB41989FA616388">
may rea&s;onably be inferred from the following con&s;iderations, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<P N="1">1. There was no &s;acrifice of atonement in&s;tituted for the&s;e crimes. For &s;ins <HI>as against God,</HI> there then was, and now is an atonement. And the <HI>great atonement</HI> typifi|ed by the bloody &s;acrifices in&s;tituted by the Mo&s;aic law, is unque&s;tionably of &s;ufficient worth to procure pardon <HI>even for the&s;e &s;ins</HI> as be|ing again&s;t God. But &s;ins as again&s;t God are infinitely more heinous and criminal, than as again&s;t men: yet, as again&s;t men, they were unpardonable, no atonement being appoint|ed for them. Con&s;equently they were puni&s;h|able with death, not &s;o much becau&s;e they were &s;ins again&s;t God, as again&s;t men. Yea, they were made capital <HI>only</HI> becau&s;e they di|rectly tended to &s;ubvert the fundamental laws of their community.</P>
<P>The good of &s;ociety, here in this world, forbids that any atonement &s;hould be made for certain crimes, even be the criminal ever &s;o humble and penitent; but, ab&s;olutely re|quires, if on no other account, yet for a ter|ror and warning to others, the utter exci&s;ion&mdash;the death of the perpetrator. Even though the criminal may be forgiven at the bar of God, &s;till he may not be pardoned by the civil magi&s;trate.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="8" REF="021599_0008_0FB4198B89499BF8">
2. That the crimes, even of <HI>Idolatry</HI> and <HI>Bla&s;phemy,</HI> were puni&s;hable with death <HI>only</HI> becau&s;e they were again&s;t the peace and good of &s;ociety, is evident from this con&s;ideration, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that as again&s;t God, they might be for|given. Thus our Saviour expre&s;ly a&s;&s;erts, Mark iii. 28. <Q>That <HI>all</HI> &s;ins &s;hall be for|given unto the &s;ons of men, and <HI>bla&s;phe|mies</HI> wherewith they &s;hall bla&s;pheme; ex|cepting only the &s;in again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t.</Q> But, as again&s;t the laws of the Jew|i&s;h community, the&s;e &s;ins were utterly unpar|donable. But, where the penalty of the law, as the crime re&s;pects the <HI>Deity, as moral gov|ernor of the univer&s;e,</HI> is remitted by <HI>him,</HI> it is unrea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that he &s;hould require <HI>man</HI> to execute it. Where God forgives &s;ins <HI>as again&s;t him&s;elf, as moral governor and king,</HI> &s;urely he would not put his &s;word into the hand of the civil magi&s;trate to execute <HI>his</HI> wrath.</P>
<P N="3">3. From the extent of the la&s;t and general judgement it may be concluded that no crimes ever are, or were, puni&s;hable by the civil magi&s;trate, in any other view, or on any other account, than as again&s;t the peace and good of human &s;ociety. All judgement is com|mitted to Chri&s;t; and every crime of what|ever nature, whether it has been before any human tribunal, or not, will, at the la&s;t day,
<PB N="9" REF="021599_0009_0FB4198CFA363CA8">
be brought into public view, and receive a ju&s;t recompence of reward. But, had the Deity authori&s;ed the civil magi&s;trate, either to puni&s;h, or to pardon, &s;ins <HI>as again&s;t him|&s;elf,</HI> this would &s;o far &s;uper&s;ede the nece&s;&s;ity of a general judgement, and deprive the Son of God of the honour of being univer&s;al judge.</P>
<P>Indeed, nothing can be more ab&s;urd than to &s;uppo&s;e that <HI>men</HI> &s;hould be judges and avengers in the cau&s;e of <HI>God. Men</HI> are, them&s;elves, all infinitely guilty in God's &s;ight; and mu&s;t, all, be arraigned as crimi|nals at his bar. Though civil magi&s;trates are &s;tiled gods, they are neverthele&s;s to die like men. But for the protection and good of &s;ociety civil rulers may be clothed with an authority which is, in &s;ome re&s;pects, an im|age of the divine. This authority they are to u&s;e for the ends which they are inve&s;ted with it; which are, that they may be a terror, not to good works, but to the evil.</P>
<P>But whenever the civil ruler attempts, in character of judge and avenger, to animad|vert upon crimes as again&s;t God, he a&s;&s;umes that to which he has not the lea&s;t imaginable right, &s;teps into the &s;eat of God, and wre&s;ts the &s;word out of his hand.</P>
<P>From the&s;e con&s;iderations we may &s;afely conclude that civil rulers may be ju&s;tified in
<PB N="10" REF="021599_0010_0FB4198E7A264E88">
making other crimes capital be&s;ides that of murder, and the civil magi&s;trate may lawful|ly inflict death upon the perpetrators of them. Men have a right to inflict capital puni&s;h|ments in every ca&s;e wherein the good of &s;oci|ety requires it:&mdash;and, <HI>of this</HI> men mu&s;t be the judges; not forgetting, however, their obli|gations to judge with di&s;cretion, impartiality and candour; and that they are accountable to God for the laws which they frame, and the &s;anctions by which they e&s;tabli&s;h them. God has put <HI>his</HI> &s;word into the hands of the civil magi&s;trate to avenge the wrongs done to &s;ociety: and, therefore, men are required to be &s;ubject to civil authority, not only for <HI>wrath,</HI> but al&s;o for <HI>con&s;cience</HI> &s;ake, Rom. xiii. 5.</P>
<P>From the&s;e con&s;iderations it appears that it is agreeable to the will of God, yea, that it is his own appointment, that there &s;hould be lodged, &s;ome where in &s;ociety, a &s;upreme power:&mdash;a power to be controuled by nothing but by the law:&mdash;a power not to be re&s;i&s;ted:&mdash;a power to execute vengeance and puni&s;h|ments. Without this power, the ends of the in&s;titution of civil government never can be an&s;wered, nor the good and &s;afety of &s;ociety in&s;ured. Without this, rulers can never be a terror to evil doers; nor encouragers of them that do well. Without this, govern|ment
<PB N="11" REF="021599_0011_0FB419900B7B6460">
cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t; but &s;ociety mu&s;t be di&s;|&s;olved.</P>
<P>It appears, further, from what has been &s;aid, that laws framed for the good of civil &s;ociety, are indeed binding upon the con|&s;ciences of men. Were it otherwi&s;e we could not be required, by the divine law, to be &s;ubject to them, not only for <HI>wrath</HI> but for <HI>con&s;cience</HI> &s;ake. Crimes committed again&s;t civil &s;ociety are not expiated by enduring the wrath of the civil magi&s;trate: but, <HI>as again&s;t &s;ociety</HI> mu&s;t have another hearing, and under|go another trial, at the bar of God. Though <HI>men</HI> may puni&s;h crimes only as being again&s;t &s;ociety: yet <HI>God</HI> will puni&s;h them as being not only again&s;t him&s;elf, but again&s;t our fel|low-creatures. Laws, framed for the good of &s;ociety, have, therefore, the double &s;anc|tion of <HI>human</HI> authority, and of the <HI>divine.</HI></P>
<P>By the in&s;titution of civil government, and the authority with which rulers are inve&s;ted from on high to be avengers, and to execute wrath upon evil doers: it appears that human governments are an image of the divine. One way, therefore, in which we are to ex|pre&s;s our &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to God, and to his au|thority, is by yielding a willing and due &s;ub|jection to civil authority and government. A member of the kingdom of Chri&s;t, will certainly be a good and peaceable member
<PB N="12" REF="021599_0012_0FB419917925DA30">
of civil &s;ociety: and where the divine law is written in the heart, it will and mu&s;t produce a regular and cheerful &s;ubjection to human laws framed for the good of &s;ociety. An un|ea&s;y, re&s;tle&s;s member of civil &s;ociety, impa|tient of every human re&s;traint, is not qualifi|ed for that &s;tate of perfect peace, &s;ubjection and harmony, which will reign in the world above,</P>
<P>Further, as in human governments pun|i&s;hments are inflicted only for the general good; &s;o al&s;o, in the divine. As it is an in|&s;tance of goodne&s;s, and of regard to the peace and welfare of &s;ociety, in the civil magi&s;trate, to execute the penalties of the civil law; &s;o is it an in&s;tance of goodne&s;s in God, and of regard to the peace and welfare of his great family, where the &s;acrifice of atonement is re|jected, to execute the penalties of the divine law. For the good of the univer&s;e can no more be &s;ecured, unle&s;s the &s;pirit and hon|our of the <HI>divine law</HI> be pre&s;erved in admin|i&s;tration, than the peace of <HI>civil &s;ociety</HI> can be pre&s;erved, unle&s;s <HI>civil law</HI> and ju&s;tice be faithfully admini&s;tered. And as civil rulers have no plea&s;ure in the pains and mi&s;ery of tho&s;e whom they are obliged to cut off from &s;ociety: &s;o the Great Ruler of the univer&s;e, as he declares with an oath, Ezek. xxxiii 11. has no plea&s;ure in the death of the wicked,
<PB N="13" REF="021599_0013_0FB41993064E3E18">
but that the wicked turn from his way and live.</P>
<P>Though human governments are an image of the divine, yet the difference, in many re&s;pects, between them, is exceedingly great: and the re&s;emblance of the former, to the lat|ter, but very faint and imperfect. As the knowledge of God extends to the &s;ecret mo|tions and exerci&s;es of the heart, &s;o do the laws of this glorious kingdom and government. But human laws extend no further than to the external actions and conduct of men; or rather to the tempers and exerci&s;es of the heart, <HI>only as they appear and are expre&s;&s;ed in overt acts:</HI> So that, in tho&s;e very in&s;tances wherein human laws <HI>may</HI> be obeyed, the pen|alties of the divine <HI>may</HI> be incurred. The perfection of the divine government, al&s;o, far tran&s;cends that of men, in this re&s;pect, that the great Governor of the world doth not de&s;cend from his high dignity as lawgiver and king, in exerci&s;ing the riche&s;t mercy and grace to innumerable multitudes of the vile&s;t of criminals; whereas, pardons may be &s;o frequent, in civil governments, as to dimin|i&s;h the authority of the magi&s;trate, and take off the terror of the law.</P>
<P>We may al&s;o conclude, that, if the judge|ment of man, and the vengeance of the civil magi&s;trate, are attended with circum&s;tances
<PB N="14" REF="021599_0014_0FB41994798F3AC0">
&s;o &s;triking and awful as tho&s;e now before us; the judgement and wrath of the eternal God mu&s;t be infinitely more awful and dreadful. If it be, as we now &s;ee, a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the <HI>civil magistrate;</HI> how fearful a thing indeed mu&s;t it be to fall into the hand of the <HI>living God!</HI></P>
<P>If the circum&s;tances of the criminals now before us, taking only into view the puni&s;h|ment, the &s;hameful death about to be inflicted on them by the hands of men, be enough to excite the pity, and move the compa&s;&s;ion of even obdurate hearts; how extremely pitia|ble and affecting are the &s;tate, and circum|&s;tances of all tho&s;e who are yet in their &s;ins, under the cur&s;e of the divine law, and expo|&s;ed, every moment, to have its mo&s;t awful penalties inflicted, in full mea&s;ure upon them?</P>
<P>Again, as the dignity and honor of the di|vine government will be &s;upported and main|tained, by God's adverting to the &s;malle&s;t crimes, and the lea&s;t offences again&s;t his ho|ly laws; is it not incumbent on the civil ma|gi&s;trate carefully to notice even &s;mall offen|ces again&s;t the laws of the community, and animadvert &s;uitably upon them? And would not this as really tend to the honor of civil government, and the peace and happine&s;s of &s;ociety, as the &s;imilar mode of conduct in the
<PB N="15" REF="021599_0015_0FB41995F9BA6970">
great Governor of the world, doth to the dignity and honor divine government, and the peace &amp; welfare of God's extended kingdom. Where &s;mall, but real crimes, are pa&s;&s;'d unnoticed by the civil magi&s;trate, the door is open to the commi&s;&s;ion of greater; and vile and wick|ed men encouraged, by and by, to bid de|fiance to all authority. And then, puni&s;h|ments for the greate&s;t crimes have a le&s;s ben|eficial effect, and the execution of them &s;its more unea&s;y upon the minds of the public, than when the laws are punctually executed, and <HI>every breach</HI> receives a ju&s;t recompence of reward. Does not the &s;tile and title of <HI>civil rulers,</HI> in the holy &s;criptures, where they are called gods, imply that in <HI>this re|&s;pect</HI> they &s;hould imitate the conduct and copy the example of HIM who&s;e commi&s;&s;ion they bear.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the analogy there is, in a variety of re&s;pects, between human govern|ments and the divine, there is a wide and a material difference in the <HI>latter</HI> from the <HI>for|mer,</HI> which may &s;ugge&s;t very comfortable re|flections amid &s;uch melancholy &s;cenes as that now about to be pre&s;ented before us. The judgement of <HI>man</HI> is not ab&s;olutely final; nor, in many re&s;pects, &s;imilar to that of <HI>God. God may</HI> forgive, where the <HI>civil magi&s;trate</HI> is bound to hold guilty: And the vengeance
<PB N="16" REF="021599_0016_0FB419977A0CDAE8">
of <HI>Heaven may</HI> be averted from the unhappy object on whom that of <HI>&s;ociety</HI> mu&s;t be exe|cuted. It is po&s;&s;ible that a criminal <HI>may</HI> go from the halter, or the &s;take, to a &s;eat of honor and everla&s;ting glory. The venge|ance of the civil magi&s;trate, and of God, are not the &s;ame: nor is the great Governor of the world circum&s;cribed within the &s;ame rules and limits re&s;pecting executions, as bind the civil magi&s;trate. Human laws leave no room for <HI>repentance;</HI> but, by the gracious con&s;titution of God, <HI>this</HI> may be a mean of obtaining pardon for the mo&s;t heinous of crimes. When, therefore, we &s;ee one of our fellow men cut off by the hand of civil ju&s;tice, we cannot from thence infer, with any certainty, that divine ju&s;tice requires his final perdition. Yea, the circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e <HI>may</HI> be &s;uch that we may have rea|&s;on to conclude that even the axe, or the halter, may be a pa&s;&s;port to a world of end|le&s;s felicity and joy.</P>
<P>But, I mu&s;t clo&s;e with one or two ad|dre&s;&s;es &s;uited to the pre&s;ent &s;olemn occa|&s;ion. And,</P>
<P>I. <HI>To the pri&s;oners now brought out for ex|ecution.</HI></P>
<P>Poor, unhappy, wretched creatures! As you are now ju&s;t launching into the eternal world, how &s;hall I frame an addre&s;s to you,

<P>But oh! with what a voice of thunder, and in what &s;olemn and piercing accents, will you &s;oon be addre&s;&s;ed from the throne of everla&s;ting judgement, unle&s;s now, with penitent and broken hearts, you lift up your feeble voices in humble cries and &s;upplica|tions for mercy. The Lord is a prayer-hear|ing God. No one ever &s;ought to him in vain. He has &s;eated him&s;elf on a throne of grace, purpo&s;ely to hear the penitent cries of helple&s;s di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, undone &s;inners. Not a groan from a broken heart, but what reach|es his ears; not a &s;igh but what is noticed by him. Even one prayer, now in your la&s;t moments, breathed forth from &s;uch hearts, will a&s;cend, enter within the veil, meet accept|ance, and through the riches of divine mer|cy &s;ecure you a welcome into the ble&s;&s;ed abodes of everla&s;ting peace, where fraud and violence never come. Improve, then, the&s;e your la&s;t moments, in humble, penitent, and fervent cries to God. Remember <HI>eternity</HI> now hangs upon an hour! Infinitely import|ant events are now gathering and collecting <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, to a &s;ingle point; and infinite wi&s;dom is to give the deci&s;ion, and turn the balance!
<PB N="19" REF="021599_0019_0FB4199D2EECF850">
May divine &s;overeign mercy interpo&s;e for you, and pardon and everla&s;ting favour be your happy portion! But how your fate will be, in fact, decided, another <HI>more &s;olemn and im|portant</HI> day than this will declare. I ill then, I bid you a la&s;t, a cordial, a mournful fare|well.</P>
<P><HI>A few words to this great a&s;&s;embly &s;hall con|clude the di&s;cour&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>What an awful &s;pectacle is now pre&s;ented before you. The hand of heaven vi&s;ibly turned again&s;t the di&s;turbers of the common peace; and the me&s;&s;engers of death now ju&s;t about to &s;eize and devour their devoted prey! In one re&s;pect we here behold a melancholy in&s;tance of the truth of what the apo&s;tle a&s;|&s;erts, James i. 15. <Q>That lu&s;t, when it hath conceived, bringeth forth &s;in: and &s;in, when it is fini&s;hed, bringeth forth death.</Q> Let this in&s;tance be a warning, a &s;olemn warning to all, how they venture to break the bands of civil &s;ociety, defy its laws and vengeance, and, in that, bid defi|ance to the laws and vengeance of the Al|mighty! <Q>If thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for the ruler beareth not the &s;word in vain; for he is the mini&s;ter of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.</Q> Be afraid of &s;mall crimes, and le&s;s encroachments upon the
<PB N="20" REF="021599_0020_0FB4199E43BB1BD0">
rules of equity and righteou&s;ne&s;s; and by this melancholy in&s;tance, &s;ee to what they <HI>may</HI> lead, and in what they <HI>may</HI> terminate. Great things often &s;ucceed, but &s;mall begin|ings, and, the mo&s;t henious offences, gene|rally take their ri&s;e from &s;maller crimes. Let this con&s;ideration make you afraid even to take a &s;tep in forbidden paths.</P>
<P>Let parents take warning how they edu|cate their children, and what examples they &s;et before them. Early habits take deep root, and are with great difficulty eradicated or overcome. Inure them to &s;ubjection and obedience, and endeavour to in&s;till into their minds a dread, a horror of every degree of inju&s;tice and violence. Con&s;ider how much the peace of &s;ociety, and their own ever|la&s;ting good, may depend upon it. Your own bad in&s;tructions and examples will have the pernicious influence to encourage to greater crimes; and <HI>may</HI> finally bring them to the gallows, and terminate to their ever|la&s;ting de&s;truction.</P>
<P>But, however &s;olemn the pre&s;ent &s;cene may be to the devoted criminals now before us, on account of the more awful judgement which awaits them; let us all remember that the &s;ame &s;olemn hour awaits each one of us. Our eyes mu&s;t &s;oon &s;ee them, and &s;ee each other, at the tribunal of God. And what|ever
<PB N="21" REF="021599_0021_0FB4199FBA2C2A88">
may be <HI>their</HI> fate, if <HI>we</HI> die impenitent, whether we go from the gallows, from a &s;take, or from a bed of down, we &s;hall with equal certainty hear the awful &s;entence: <HI>De|part, ye cur&s;ed, into everla&s;ting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.</HI></P>
<P>O then improve, thankfully and wi&s;ely improve, the happy &s;ea&s;on of grace indulged to you, but denied to them! Remember we are by nature, the &s;ame vile creatures, in the &s;ight of God, as they; and perhaps, ma|ny of us much more criminal and vile. <HI>We</HI> &s;tand in as ab&s;olute need of an infinite at|tonement, and infinite mercy. <HI>Their</HI> con|duct is but a &s;pecimen of human nature&mdash;of what is naturally in each of our hearts. And not unto our&s;elves, but to the kind provi|dence, and the re&s;training goodne&s;s of God, is it to be a&s;cribed, that <HI>we</HI> are not now in <HI>their</HI> mournful &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Let no one, then, glory over them: but, as we our&s;elves need infinite <HI>mercy</HI> as well as they, let us put on bowels of mercy, and pour out our hearts in humble cries, that divine grace may de&s;cend and arre&s;t them. That God and Saviour whom we profe&s;s to wor&s;hip, is able to wound and to pour grace into their hearts. Once, <HI>when him&s;elf was making his &s;oul an offering for &s;in,</HI> he di&s;play|ed his glory and &s;aving power by converting
<PB N="22" REF="021599_0022_0FB419A139CE85E0">
one who was <HI>that moment hanging on a tree.</HI> Let us all put up our humble and fervent cries to HIM, that a &s;imilar di&s;play of his power and grace may now be made! And, if we, and the&s;e unhappy victims of civil ju&s;|tice be made the &s;ubjects of his converting grace, let death come when it may, or in whatever form, we may unite in &s;inging that triumphant &s;ong, <Q>O death where is thy &s;ting? O grave, where is thy victo|ry!</Q> May God of his infinite mercy, grant that this may be the happy lot of us all, through JESUS CHRIST.&mdash;AMEN.</P>
