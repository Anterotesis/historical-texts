<Q><BIBL><HI>2 KINGS, Chap. V. Ver. 1^s^t.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Now Naaman, Captain of the Ho&s;t of the King of Syria, was a great Man with his Ma&s;ter and honou|rable, becau&s;e by him the Lord had given Deliverance unto Syria; he was al&s;o a mighty Man in Valor.&mdash;</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THE Story of <HI>Naaman,</HI> as it is tran&s;mitted to us in the &s;acred Pages, affords a Variety of In|&s;tructions, &s;uited to the &s;everal Circum&s;tances and Conditions of human Life. Altho' he was a <HI>Pagan,</HI> the Holy Gho&s;t him&s;elf has been plea&s;ed to mention him with &s;ingular Re&s;pect; and to repre&s;ent his Character, not altogether unworthy the Imitation of tho&s;e, who are favored with &s;uperior religious Advantages. This <HI>Syrian</HI> Commander appears
<PB N="6" REF="006655_0004_1029750B4B2DB5A8">
to have been a great Man in him&s;elf, as well as by the Favor of his Prince. His Honors were well &s;upported by his intrin&s;ic Worth: He filled with Dignity the high and important Station to which he was advanced. And be&s;ides the ad|vantageous Figure which he bears in the Writings of the Old Te&s;tament, our Lord has taken Occa&s;ion to &s;peak of him in the New, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke iv.27.</NOTE> as one for who&s;e Per&s;on God had a particular Regard, and for who&s;e Welfare He was peculiarly concerned.</P>
<P>Human Nature, we know, has been much the &s;ame in all Ages. Pre&s;ently after the Fall tho&s;e Lu&s;ts of Men began to <HI>conceive and bring forth, from whence come Wars and Fightings.</HI> The untimely Death of <HI>Abel</HI> was a &s;hocking Proof of this, who fell a Sacrifice to the Envy and Rage of his unnatural Brother. Such Lu&s;ts as the&s;e <HI>war|ring in the Members</HI> of &s;ingle Per&s;ons, influenced al&s;o the Communities which the&s;e Individuals compo&s;ed; and States and Kingdoms as they ro&s;e in the World, &s;oon began to look upon one another with a jealous Eye; and to di&s;cover an unrea&s;onable Fondne&s;s of enlarging their own Bounds, and flouri&s;hing upon the Ruins of their Neighbors. So that after all that has been &s;aid of the Innocence and Simplicity of former Times, by
<PB N="7" REF="006655_0005_1029750CD065D488">
tho&s;e who have rather con&s;idered what Mankind ought to be, than what in Fact they have been: It is certain, that War was as unavoidable, and an Addre&s;s in this fatal Art as nece&s;&s;ary, in the early Ages of the World, as they are at pre&s;ent. To this Service <HI>Naaman</HI> devoted him&s;elf; and for this he had peculiar Talents; po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing at once the Intrepidity of a Soldier, and the Capacity of a General. He was in his Per&s;on, <HI>a mighty Man of Valor</HI>; and in his Po&s;t, he was Captain of the whole Ho&s;t of <HI>Syria.</HI></P>
<P>His &s;uperior Talents were neither buried in Indolence and Supinene&s;s; nor &s;o mi&s;applied, as to be wor&s;e than u&s;ele&s;s. Had either of the&s;e been the Ca&s;e, he would not have been repre&s;ented in holy Writ as &s;o honorable a Per&s;on. But that which exalted his Character, and threw a Lu&s;tre around it, was, that he con&s;idered him&s;elf as born for others; and as Honor called, and Duty obliged him, he employed his Capacity and Power for the Good of his Country, and bravely endeavored the Deliverance of <HI>Syria.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Naaman</HI> happily accompli&s;hed tho&s;e public Services which he had undertaken; and Provi|dence tho't fit to crown his generous Fortitude with &s;ingular Succe&s;s. God, who has re&s;erved in his own Hands the Fate of Empires and King|doms;
<PB N="8" REF="006655_0006_1029750E546680F0">
who exalts them with a Smile, or depre&s;&s;es them with a Frown, was plea&s;ed to honor him as an In&s;trument of conveying to the <HI>Syrians,</HI> that Pro&s;perity which he had de&s;igned for them. By him, &s;ays the Text, <HI>the Lord had given Delive|rance to Syria.</HI></P>
<P>No wonder then that <HI>Naaman</HI> was &s;o high in the E&s;teem of his Prince. <HI>He was a great Man with his Ma&s;ter.</HI> The King was &s;en&s;ible of his Worth; had a ju&s;t Re&s;entment of his important Services, and gave him Marks of his peculiar Fa|vor. Such was his Confidence in him that he ap|pointed him General of his Forces: And his ten|der Affection for his Per&s;on appears in the Letter which he wrote on his Behalf, and &s;ent by his own Hands to the King of <HI>I&s;rael.</HI> &mdash; It is happy for Princes when they di&s;tingui&s;h between the precious and the vile; when they are quick to di&s;cern and prompt to cheri&s;h and reward true Virtue and Merit; and only Per&s;ons of this Character are allowed to po&s;&s;e&s;s their Affections, and to be ex|alted by their Favor. Then their own Honor and the People's Happine&s;s will flouri&s;h together: &mdash; For where the People are happy, the Ruler m<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"> be glorious.</P>
<P>But we have not yet con&s;idered <HI>Naaman</HI>'s Ho|nor in the full Extent of it. He was the Darling
<PB N="9" REF="006655_0007_1029750FD884CB60">
of the People, as well as the Favourite of his Prince; not only <HI>a great Man with his Ma&s;ter, but honourable</HI>; i. e. according to Bi&s;hop <HI>Patrick,</HI> he was highly e&s;teemed and honored by his Fel|low Subjects. This is an additional Proof of the intrin&s;ic Worth and Goodne&s;s of his Character; a &s;trong Pre&s;umption that he neither gained his Ad|vancement by di&s;honorable Means, nor employed it to any ba&s;e unworthy Ends. The <HI>Syrians</HI> found their own Happine&s;s in his Exaltation. After ex|tending the Glory of his Country abroad, he did not, like &s;ome Conquerors, return Home to en|&s;lave it. His Per&s;onal Valor, and his victorious Army were the Defence, not the Terror of the People: &mdash; they reaped the happy Fruits of the Toils he endured, and the Dangers which he fa|ced:&mdash;they owned their Guardian and Benefactor; and as &s;uch, far from envying his Greatne&s;s, they rejoiced in it, and augmented it with their own Applau&s;es.</P>
<P>What a great and happy Man does <HI>Naaman</HI> appear to be! Adorned with &s;o much Virtue! Crowned with &s;uch Succe&s;s! A cho&s;en In&s;tru|ment in the Hand of Providence to deliver his Country! So di&s;tingui&s;hed by the Favor of his Royal Ma&s;ter; and &s;o high in the Love and Ad|miration of the People! But alas, pure and un|allayed Pro&s;perity is what the pre&s;ent Life, will by

no means admit. Human Nature at its be&s;t E&s;tate is but imperfect; and the mo&s;t happy Cir|cum&s;tances the World can place a Man in, are always mingled with &s;omething di&s;agreable and adver&s;e. <HI>Naaman</HI> in the Heigth of his Power, and the Fulne&s;s of his Glory was &s;eized with a di&s;tre&s;&s;ing Di&s;ea&s;e, which all his Greatne&s;s could not defend him from, nor all his Fortitude make him ea&s;y under. <HI>He was a mighty Man in Valor, but he was a Leper.</HI> In his Affliction he hears by a captive Maid of the Prophet <HI>Eli&s;ha,</HI> and the Wonders performed by him in the Name of his God. Immediately he &s;ets out on his Journey to the Prophet, and implores the Help of the Deity, whom he wor&s;hipped. &mdash; But how often is the Wi&s;dom of God Fooli&s;hne&s;s with Men, and the Ju&s;tne&s;s of His Appointments called in Que&s;tion by the prejudiced Great, and the &s;hort-&s;ighted Politicians of the Earth! <HI>Naaman</HI> is at fir&s;t offended with the Method which the Prophet di|rects for his Recovery: It was plain and &s;imple, and therefore with him it was fooli&s;h; not con&s;i|dering that the <HI>Waters of Jordan,</HI> at the Ap|pointment, and with the Ble&s;&s;ing of the God of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> could do that, which the mo&s;t co&s;tly Me|dicines, joined with all the pompous Super&s;titions of <HI>Syria,</HI> were never able to effect. &mdash; But by the prudent Advice of his Servants, he is &s;oon bro't to a better Mind; <HI>he wa&s;hes in Jordan, and is
<PB N="11" REF="006655_0009_10297518E3E5ED18">
clean.</HI> Struck with A&s;toni&s;hment at the Great|ne&s;s of the Miracle, and filled with Gratitude to the Author of it, he adores the Power and Good|ne&s;s of <HI>Eli&s;ha</HI>'s God, and re&s;olves to offer Sacrifice to no other. <HI>Now I know,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>that there is no God in all the Earth, but in I&s;rael. Thy Servant will not offer Sacrifice, but unto the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>After this Acknowledgment and Re&s;olution, it is &s;trange to hear <HI>Naaman</HI> de&s;iring Leave to at|tend his Ma&s;ter <HI>to the Hou&s;e of Rimmon, to bow with him there</HI>: and altho' his Intention in this was rather to pay Re&s;pect to his Prince, than any Honor to the Idol; yet he was &s;en&s;ible him&s;elf that the Action carried in it the Appearance of Evil, if nothing wor&s;e; for which Rea&s;on he begs it may be pardoned. It is hard, even for an hone&s;t Courtier to maintain an inflexible Vir|tue; and here the Fortitude of <HI>Naaman</HI> appears to fail him, tho' he was upon the whole a Man of Integrity: He was a new Convert, and di&s;|covered &s;ome Weakne&s;s; but he was a real one, and as &s;uch the Prophet bids him <HI>depart in Peace.</HI> &mdash;Thus the &s;evere Affliction of <HI>Naaman</HI> proved in the End of the greate&s;t Advantage to him: had he not been a Leper, he might &s;till have re|mained ignorant of the true God; but the Lo&s;s of his Health was abundantly made up in the di|vine Knowledge which he attained; and he would
<PB N="12" REF="006655_0010_1029751A689C1288">
really have been more great and happy in this Knowledge alone, than the mo&s;t pro&s;perous Cir|cum&s;tances could have made him without it.</P>
<P>This Pa&s;&s;age of &s;acred Hi&s;tory, thus de&s;canted upon, &s;ugge&s;ts to us &s;everal Ob&s;ervations, not al|together foreign to the pre&s;ent Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>IN the FIRST Place, We may ob&s;erve from it, that true Fortitude is an honorable Quality; and repre&s;ented as &s;uch in the &s;acred Oracles. It is in|deed unhappy for the World, that the Profe&s;&s;ion of a Soldier is become &s;o nece&s;&s;ary an one. No Per&s;on of Humanity, and much le&s;s one po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that divine Benevolence which Chri&s;tianity in|&s;pires, can help being &s;en&s;ibly touched, when he contemplates the Confu&s;ion and Mi&s;ery which War introduces; and ob&s;erves, how ingenious Men are to contrive, and how prompt to carry into Execution, the &s;ure&s;t Methods of de&s;troying one another. But &s;ince Communities have their Rights as well as private Per&s;ons; and each one, not content with the Enjoyment of its own, is but too apt to invade the Rights of others; the Welfare of a State does therefore call for Valor as well as Policy; and the Soldier is as nece&s;&s;ary to a Community as the Magi&s;trate: While the latter pre&s;erves it from inte&s;tine Confu&s;ions, the former is to defend it from foreign Inva&s;ions.
<PB N="13" REF="006655_0011_1029751C10AEA528">
The military Character, when viewed in this Light, is an honorable one; and the Succe&s;s of a Soldier, who acts in the ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary Defence of his Country, is truly glorious.</P>
<P>It is certainly for the Intere&s;t of a Community, to treat with Re&s;pect tho&s;e martial Accompli&s;h|ments, which in the pre&s;ent State of Things, are &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to its Defence. Honor is the Parent of brave and meritorious Actions, and the Poli|ticians of the World have endeavoured by this Means to propagate them. They have known that the Love of Life &s;o deeply implanted in our Nature, is apt to make Men &s;hrink back from tho&s;e dangerous Services, to which the Safety of their Country may call them: and accordingly they have endeavored to le&s;&s;en this, by artfully addre&s;&s;ing to the Love of Fame, an Affection as natural to Men as the former, and oftentimes &s;uperior to it. By this Motive alone, many have been led to &s;erve their Country in the mo&s;t im|portant In&s;tances, who, it is to be feared, would never have &s;erved it upon better Principles. The <HI>Romans</HI> therefore had their particular Marks of Honor, to reward the Bravery of their Soldiers, according to their different Ranks and Degrees of Merit; and as Victories gave Occa&s;ion to their Triumphs, &s;o Triumphs, in their Turn, begot Victories.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="006655_0012_1029752387310C98">Some perhaps may imagine, that tho' War is oftentimes nece&s;&s;ary, and therefore lawful, yet it does not become Chri&s;tian Communities to take any &s;uch Methods as the&s;e, to encourage and re|ward the Soldier; ina&s;much as they have a natu|ral Tendency to inflame the Ambition of Men; to take them off from better Principles, and form them only into <HI>Pagan</HI> Heroes; who&s;e Love of Glory was generally extravagant, and their Pur&s;uit of it wild and fanta&s;tical.&mdash;But it is by no means the De&s;ign of Religion wholly to eradicate the natural Pa&s;&s;ions and Affections of human Na|ture; only to direct them to their proper Objects, and correct their Exce&s;&s;es. The Love of Fame, or a De&s;ire of the E&s;teem and Commendation of others, tho' it may be too &s;trong, hurrying Men into a fooli&s;h and ab&s;urd Behaviour, and &s;o di&s;ap|pointing it&s;elf, is neverthele&s;s, under proper Re|gulations, a ju&s;t Principle of Action. It is not indeed, the highe&s;t and the be&s;t; but it has it's Place, and in Conjunction with other Principles, is of great Service in the Conduct of human Life. The Go&s;pel therefore, has never required us to lay this Motive wholly a&s;ide, but plainly allows, as the Author of Nature certainly intended, that it &s;hould influence us in &s;ome good and rea&s;onable Degree. It even addre&s;&s;es to this natural Affecti|on, and recommends the &s;everal Graces of the Chri&s;tian Life, from the Con&s;ideration of their
<PB N="15" REF="006655_0013_102975250BACB560">
Decency &mdash; encouraging us to <HI>let our Light &s;hine before Men</HI>; to think upon and practi&s;e <HI>what&s;o|ever is honorable and lovely, as well as ju&s;t and true</HI>; what&s;oever is ornamental to human Nature, and perfective of it. The Rewards al&s;o, which the Go&s;pel promi&s;es to the Ju&s;t in the coming State, are glorious ones:&mdash;They&punc; who have been <HI>faithful to the Death,</HI> are repre&s;ented in white Robes,&mdash;their Hands filled with Palms, and their Temples adorned with Crowns. So that our re|ligious Profe&s;&s;ion is no way incon&s;i&s;tent with the Pur&s;uit of Glory, provided it be real and &s;ub|&s;tantial, not fal&s;e and imaginary. <HI>If there be any Virtue, and if there be any Prai&s;e,</HI> we are en|couraged to follow it: &mdash; And as &s;uch, Fortitude in particular is recommended to us. This Quali|ty, &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the military Character, the Go&s;|pel with all it's <HI>Peace and Good-will to Men,</HI> with all it's meek forgiving Spirit, is very far from condemning: It only gives us a ju&s;t Idea of it; determines it's Limits; &s;ettles it upon proper Principles; and rejects the &s;everal Counterfeits of this Virtue, which commonly pa&s;s in the World for Bravery, tho' they never de&s;erved &s;o hono|rable a Name.</P>
<P>The Fortitude of a Chri&s;tian is not that Con|tempt of Death, which is founded upon a Slowne&s;s of Apprehen&s;ion, and an Ab&s;ence of Thought;
<PB N="16" REF="006655_0014_102975269214C0F0">
which is a meer Privation, rather than any po&s;i|tive Attainment, and no great Credit to one, who has the Figure of a rea&s;onable Being. It is diffe|rent from the Courage that appears in other Men of quicker Apprehen&s;ions; that flows from Warmth of Blood, and a bri&s;k Agitation of the Spirits; that &s;u&s;pends the Exerci&s;e of Rea&s;on, and ra&s;hly plunges them into the greate&s;t Dangers. This &s;ort of Hero po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es much the &s;ame Kind of Ardor as the Hor&s;e upon which he rides, who <HI>&s;wallows the Ground with his Fiercene&s;s and Rage, and believeth not that it is the Sound of the Trum|pet.</HI>&mdash;Many owe their Valor to a natural Firm|ne&s;s of Con&s;titution;&mdash;to their having been habi|tuated and enur'd to Dangers; &mdash; to a cruel and unnatural Delight in Scenes of De&s;olation and Slaughter; &mdash; to a Spirit of Revenge; &mdash; or a &s;en|&s;ual rapacious Di&s;po&s;ition, which makes them de|&s;pi&s;e Toils and Hazards, from the Pro&s;pect of rioting upon the Spoils of Victory.&mdash;But Chri&s;tian Fortitude is a Greatne&s;s of Mind, flowing from the rational and divine Principles of the Go&s;pel, that leads a Per&s;on at all Adventures to act up to the Dictates of his Con&s;cience, and renders him, while he does &s;o, undaunted in Dangers, and un&s;ubdued by Sufferings.</P>
<P>Our holy Religion admoni&s;hes the Soldier, to regulate his Ardor, and pur&s;ue his Glory by the
<PB N="17" REF="006655_0015_10297528193CCCD8">
Rules of Ju&s;tice, without which, the Hero dege|nerates into a Robber and a Murderer; and his Infamy enlarges with his Succe&s;s. It in&s;tructs him to maintain the Activity of his Body, and the Vigor of his Spirit, by <HI>being temperate in all Things</HI>; and to acquire a Strength and Compac|tedne&s;s of Mind, able to <HI>endure Hardne&s;s,</HI> by the habitual Practice of Patience and Self-Denial. While it leaves him that Sen&s;e of Honor &s;o pecu|liar to the Profe&s;&s;ion of a Soldier, it affords him other Principles to co-operate with and correct it; and all united give him a Firmne&s;s of Soul, which this alone would be in&s;ufficient to. It obliges him to that habitual Hone&s;ty of Intention, and In|nocence of Behavior, which are always accompa|nied with a manly Confidence and Courage. It in&s;pires him with a di&s;intere&s;ted Benevolence, a public Spirit, that animates him to exert him&s;elf in a Cau&s;e, in Proportion to the Importance of it to the Welfare of others; and makes him forget his own Ea&s;e and Safety, in the Service of his Country.</P>
<P>It has indeed been objected to the Go&s;pel that it does not particularly enjoin Love to our Country. But is not the whole Sy&s;tem of it evidently cal|culated to promote that &s;incere and univer&s;al Love to Mankind, which certainly comprizes in it this, and all other inferior &s;ocial Affections? Does it
<PB N="18" REF="006655_0016_1029752F8AAD13F8">
not oblige us in all Circum&s;tances, and upon all Occa&s;ions to do the <HI>greate&s;t</HI> Good? And is not this obliging us to &s;erve the Community to which we belong, in every In&s;tance not incon&s;i&s;tent with univer&s;al Benevolence? This it <HI>primarily</HI> enjoins, and with very good Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>For altho' the Love of our Country is a noble Affection, yet it has its Limits, beyond which it degenerates into a Fault. It is evident the <HI>Romans</HI> were extravagant in it: &mdash; this Pa&s;&s;ion was &s;o un|bounded in them, that they &s;ent Terror and Di&s;|tre&s;s with their Armies, to the mo&s;t di&s;tant and peaceful Nations, and trampled upon the Rights of all Mankind, for the &s;ake of enlarging the Grandeur and Authority of <HI>Rome.</HI> However then we may admire their Courage, we cannot in this applaud their Virtue. For as the Intere&s;t of &s;ingle Families, ought always to be regarded in &s;ubordi|nation to the Welfare of the Community: &s;o the Love of our Country &s;hould never be &s;o great, as to &s;wallow up tho&s;e Sentiments of Ju&s;tice and Be|nevolence, which we owe to Mankind in general. It was therefore finely &s;aid, <HI>I love my Friends well; I love my Country better; but I love the World of Mankind be&s;t of all.</HI> This is a Sentiment per|fectly agreable to the Go&s;pel, and enters into the Character of the Chri&s;tian Hero. Chri&s;tianity al|lows us to &s;erve our Country only in a ju&s;t Cau&s;e;
<PB N="19" REF="006655_0017_102975310F1B8208">
&mdash;in &s;uch a Cau&s;e it obliges us to Action; and is able to in&s;pire us with an undaunted Spirit.&mdash;In &s;uch a Cau&s;e it teaches us to depend for Succe&s;s upon Him, who loves Equity; who <HI>does his Plea&s;ure in the Armies</HI> of Earth, as well <HI>among the Ho&s;ts of Heaven</HI>; and who gives the Victory where He plea&s;es.&mdash;Or if Succe&s;s is denied, it di&s;|po&s;es us to acquie&s;ce in the Divine Will, which is all-perfect; and to re&s;ign Life with tran&s;port, not from the Hopes of immortal Fame here, a poor &s;hadowy Exi&s;tence; but the Pro&s;pect of that &s;ub&s;tantial <HI>Life and Immortality brought to Light by the Go&s;pel.</HI></P>
<P>Nor is the Valor of the religious Soldier ever &s;eparated from Meekne&s;s, and a generous Com|pa&s;&s;ion to the vanqui&s;hed. To engage in Battle meerly from Hatred and Revenge, and to im|prove a Conque&s;t to the gratifying any &s;uch mean and rancorous Pa&s;&s;ions, is alien from the Spirit of the Go&s;pel, and a certain Indication of Littlene&s;s of Mind. Humanity and Pity, are e&s;&s;ential Ingre|dients of a truly bold and great Spirit.&mdash;Such an one, knows how to enlarge his Glory, by &s;etting Bounds to his Victories: Nor is he more ready to encounter an haughty and threatning Enemy, than to pardon and oblige one whom his Valor has di&s;|armed, and reduced into his own Power. <HI>A Coward has fought,</HI> &s;ays a polite Writer, <HI>a Cow|ard

<P>The Government of our Pa&s;&s;ions is e&s;&s;ential to true Fortitude. Slavery breaks the Spirits, and &s;ubdues the Force of the Mind; and there is cer|tainly no meaner Slave than one who is ma&s;tered by his own Pa&s;&s;ions, and cannot po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf. The Man of chri&s;tian Bravery is free from this Bondage: He &s;ubjects every wayward Humor, and every blind Impetus to the Dictates of Rea&s;on and Religion: &mdash; Whenever he is called to <HI>the Battle of the Warrior, which is with confu&s;ed Noi&s;e, and Garments rolled in Blood,</HI> he &s;till main|tains &s;omething of that Calmne&s;s and Serenity, with which we may &s;uppo&s;e, an Angel executes the Wrath of Heaven. And in this Self-govern|ment, he appears to the Eye of &s;ober Rea&s;on, with greater Dignity, than in all his other Con|que&s;ts: for <HI>he that is &s;low to Wrath is better than the Mighty, and he that ruleth his Spirit than he that taketh a City.</HI></P>

does it deprive him of the Valor which this Pro|fe&s;&s;ion implies: On the contrary, it recommends to him a refined and exalted Fortitude, and gives him the be&s;t Motives to &s;upport it. Nor ought we to e&s;teem this Virtue, in the ju&s;t Extent of it, a low and incon&s;iderable one; &s;ince the &s;acred Scriptures have &s;et it in another Light; and re|pre&s;ented it to us, as accompanied with, and made up of, the pure&s;t and mo&s;t divine Principles, that are ever to be found in human Nature.</P>
<P>A SECOND OBSERVATION is, That He only ap|pears truly great, and worthy the E&s;teem of Man|kind, who&s;e &s;uperior Talents, and high Station, are improved to the Welfare of others. Notwith&s;tan|ding the Valor of <HI>Naaman</HI>; notwith&s;tanding his high and important Po&s;t, the Holy Gho&s;t would not have repre&s;ented him as &s;o great and honorable a Per&s;onage, if he had not exerted him&s;elf for the Good of his Country, and <HI>given Deliverance unto Syria.</HI></P>
<P>One of a narrow &s;elfi&s;h Spirit, who&s;e Charity ends as well as begins at home, who has bur&s;t the &s;ocial Link that &s;hould unite him to others, and make the common Intere&s;t his own, who only lives and feels for him&s;elf, is really mean and contemptible, and repre&s;ented as &s;uch in the &s;a|cred Oracles. No external Circum&s;tances can add any Thing to the intrin&s;ic Value of his Character:
<PB N="22" REF="006655_0020_1029753A56704EF8">
And Titles and Preferment to a Man of &s;uch little Worth, are like a fal&s;e Medium to an Object of Sight, they magnify him in Appearance, but not in Reality.</P>
<P>Neither will a &s;uperior Capacity, added to the&s;e exterior Di&s;tinctions, be &s;ufficient to render him truly great; this being only valuable according to the U&s;e that is made of it, and the Purpo&s;es to which it is employed. Let a Per&s;on be po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed of Valor or Policy in ever &s;o high a Degree, yet if others receive no Benefit from the right Ap|plication of the&s;e great Qualities, Mankind owe him no E&s;teem, nor can he ju&s;tly expect it from them. Nay, a &s;uperior Capacity, when &s;eparated from an hone&s;t, di&s;intere&s;ted, public Spirit; and under the Direction of &s;elfi&s;h and ba&s;e Principles, does but render a Man the more exten&s;ively mi&s;|chievous, and therefore the more de&s;ervedly odi|ous.&mdash;Goodne&s;s then is e&s;&s;ential to true Great|ne&s;s, and he, the honorable Per&s;on, who like the Sun, is as exten&s;ively u&s;eful, as exalted in his Sta|tion; who while he dazles with his Lu&s;tre, re|fre&s;hes with his kindly Influences; and whom the World at once admires and enjoys.</P>
<P>Nor has this diffu&s;ive Goodne&s;s ever been found to le&s;&s;en private Happine&s;s: On the contrary, he, who according to the Directions of the Go&s;pel,
<PB N="23" REF="006655_0021_1029753BDC0BD328">
cultivates tho&s;e &s;ocial In&s;tincts, which the Author of Nature has implanted in our Bo&s;oms; and who makes the Good of others an Object of real Af|fection, is acquainted with a thou&s;and Plea&s;ures, which a contracted Heart knows nothing of. "He receives Happine&s;s at &s;econd Hand, and by Rebound from others, as well as by direct and immediate Sen&s;ation;" and whether he &s;erves his Country in the Cabinet, or in the Field, he really enjoys the Pro&s;perity of the whole Community, in the &s;ame Proportion he endeavors to promote it. &mdash;This is the right Po&s;ture of an human Soul; and in this Attitude it appears with true Beauty and Lu&s;tre:&mdash;it appears, like one of tho&s;e &s;upe|rior Beings, who glory in the Stile <HI>of mini&s;tring Spirits</HI>; and who&s;e delightful Employment it is, under Providence, to defend and ble&s;s Mankind. Per&s;ons then of this Character are entitled to the E&s;teem and Prai&s;e of the World; and they who are more immediately under their Guardian&s;hip, and reap the Fruits of their public-&s;pirited Con|duct, <HI>they who &s;it under their Shadow with great Delight,</HI> cannot help adding to their E&s;teem, Gra|titude and Love. All this is but a ju&s;t Debt, to &s;uch eminent Virtue and Goodne&s;s; and every Man &s;hould be ready to pay his own Proportion of it. This is one way to &s;pread the&s;e Qualities in the World, and increa&s;e the Number of &s;uch Characters.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="006655_0022_102974FF0F835FE0">The <HI>Greeks</HI> therefore, were neither ju&s;t nor po|litic, in bani&s;hing tho&s;e from the Common-wealth&punc; who by their great and &s;hining Actions, had gained the Admiration of the People. This <HI>bad Effect,</HI> &s;prung indeed from <HI>a noble Cau&s;e,</HI> a Jealou&s;y of their <HI>Liberty</HI>; but in this, their Care was over nice and &s;crupulous; the weak Sollicitude of a too indul|gent Mother, rather than a well-tempered ma&s;cu|line Affection; plainly tending to di&s;courage Per|&s;ons from di&s;tingui&s;hing them&s;elves by public Ser|vices, and to leave that <HI>Liberty</HI> naked and de|fencele&s;s, of which they were &s;o extremely fond. <HI>Carthage</HI> imitated <HI>Greece</HI> in neglecting and ill-treating at a Time of Security, tho&s;e who had be&s;t &s;erved her in a Cri&s;is of Danger: and being not &s;o fruitful of Patriots and Heroes as the other, this Conduct had a very unhappy Influence upon her Affairs. <HI>Hannibal</HI> indeed performed Wonders, under all his Di&s;couragements from home; but this, was perhaps as much owing to the invincible Hatred which from his Infancy he had conceived to the <HI>Romans,</HI> as an Affection for <HI>Carthage,</HI> that had &s;o ill rewarded his Bravery and Merit.</P>
<P>Nor can we think it &s;trange, if &s;ome of the greate&s;t Spirits among the <HI>Heathen,</HI> were by &s;uch Treatment di&s;couraged from &s;erving the Public.&mdash; But the Principles of Chri&s;tianity, are able to &s;upport us under &s;o hard a Lot. Our divine Redeemer

has taught us to regard the Rule of Duty, rather than the Acceptance of our Services; And to con|tinue to do good, even to tho&s;e who return us ill; a&s;&s;uring us, that <HI>our Reward is great,</HI> while we thus approve our&s;elves <HI>the Children of our Father in Heaven,</HI> who cau&s;es his Sun to ri&s;e, and his Rain to fall, <HI>upon the evil, and the unthankful.</HI></P>
<P>IN the THIRD PLACE, this Pa&s;&s;age &s;ugge&s;ts to us, how much Influence the Providence of God has, in the Government of the World, and in crowning the Services of Patriots and Warriors with Succe&s;s. Little as <HI>Naaman</HI> knew Him, it was the God of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> who fitted him for his high and important Po&s;t; who exalted him to it; and u&s;ed him as an In&s;trument in his own Hand to <HI>give Deliverance unto Syria.</HI> He is <HI>the God of the Spirits of all Fle&s;h:</HI> From Him, we receive the Powers of our Bodies, and the Faculties of our Minds: He, di&s;tingui&s;hes Men by their various Capacities, and places them in their &s;everal Stati|ons. <HI>The Under&s;tanding of the prudent</HI>; the Authority of the great; the Valor of the mighty; and the public Spirit of the Patriot, are from Him &mdash;<HI>the Father of Lights, from whom cometh down every good, and every perfect Gift. God &s;itteth upon the Circle of the Earth, and the Inhabitants thereof are before Him as Gra&s;hoppers</HI>;&mdash;He, ex|alteth or depre&s;&s;eth them, <HI>putting down one, and

<P>We have a remarkable In&s;tance of this in the Introduction of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Empire. <HI>Cyrus</HI> the <HI>Per&s;ian,</HI> was no more a Wor&s;hipper of the true JEHOVAH, than <HI>Naaman the Syrian:</HI> yet, he was an elect Servant of God, formed by his Spirit, and employed in his Providence, to accompli&s;h &s;ome great and important Ends, which his Wi&s;|dom had de&s;igned. The Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah,</HI> gave a particular Account of him, and the Purpo&s;es God intended to an&s;wer by him, &s;everal Ages before he was born. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai. xlv.</NOTE> <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord to his anointed, to Cyrus, who&s;e right Hand I have holden, to &s;ub|due Nations before him: and I will loo&s;e the Loins of Kings, to open before him the two leaved Gates, and the Gates &s;hall not be &s;hut. I will go before thee, and make the crooked Places &s;trait; and I will break in Pieces the Gates of Bra&s;s, and cut in &s;under the Bars of Iron. And I will give thee the Trea&s;ures of Darkne&s;s, and hidden Riches of &s;ecret Places, that thou maye&s;t know, that I the Lord, which call thee by thy Name, am the God of I&s;rael.

For Jacob my Servant's &s;ake, and I&s;rael mine Elect, I have even called thee by thy Name: I have &s;ur|named thee, though thou ha&s;t not known me.</HI></P>
<P>God had determined to humble the proud and oppre&s;&s;ive Power of <HI>Babylon. Cyrus</HI> was ap|pointed to this Service, and accompli&s;hed for it. God led him by the right Hand to the Battle: for him, he broke in Pieces the Gates of Bra&s;s, and cut in &s;under the Bars of Iron: And in that very Night in which <HI>Bel&s;hazzer</HI> was drinking with his Nobles in the holy Ve&s;&s;els of the Temple, and the Hand-writing came out upon the Wall; in that very Night, <HI>Cyrus</HI> in a &s;urprizing Manner en|tered <HI>Babylon</HI>; &s;lew the impious Prince with his Nobles; and fulfilled the divine Predictions and Decrees. As to the Method he made u&s;e of to penetrate into the City, by draining the deep Channel of <HI>Euphrates,</HI> a Stratagem without a Pa|rallel in Hi&s;tory, <HI>this,</HI> was put into his Heart by Him, who <HI>had anointed his Servant with Wi&s;dom,</HI> as well as girded him with Power: for this Cir|cum&s;tance is particularly mentioned by another Prophet: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jer. l.38.</NOTE> <HI>A Drought is upon her Waters, and they &s;hall be dried up.</HI></P>

The Hearts of Princes and Generals, of State&s;men and Politicians, <HI>are in his Hand,</HI> and <HI>he turneth them, as the Rivers of Wa|ter are turned.</HI> He can &s;trike Terror into the brave&s;t Heart, and &s;catter Confu&s;ion among the mo&s;t regular Army.

<P>There is nothing perhaps in the Di&s;pen&s;ations of divine Providence, more dark and perplexing than &s;uch an Event. Does God govern the World?

<P>&mdash;Yet not without addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to you Gentlemen of the ARTILLERY, at who&s;e Invitation we are now a&s;&s;embled in the Hou&s;e of Wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>Your ancient Company ju&s;tly bears the Title of <HI>Honorable,</HI> ina&s;much as you profe&s;s to devote your&s;elves to the Service of your Country, and
<PB N="39" REF="006655_0037_1029756CB5B344C8">
to be indu&s;trious in acquiring tho&s;e military Ac|compli&s;hments, by which, without any View of rai&s;ing your private Fortunes in this Way, you may be qualified to act, as Guardians of the Community to which you belong.</P>
<P>Such an In&s;titution is truly noble, and a &s;tand|ing Proof of the Heroic Ardor, and public Spirit, which warmed the Brea&s;ts of our Ance&s;tors, the fir&s;t Settlers of this Country. You will therefore think your&s;elves obliged to ob&s;erve the original De&s;ign of your In&s;titution; and cultivate that ge|nerous Fortitude you profe&s;s.</P>
<P>In this Chri&s;tianity gives you the be&s;t Directions, and to this it propounds the mo&s;t powerful Mo|tives. Sincerely believe the Go&s;pel of JESUS CHRIST, and let its divine Principles have their genuine Influence upon you; your Hearts will then dilate with Love to your Country: Your private Intere&s;t will become in&s;eparable from that of the public: You will act up to the Rules of true Honor: Your Courage will be bounded by Ju&s;tice, tempered with Kindne&s;s and Compa&s;&s;ion; and guided by a Sen&s;e of Duty: In a Word, you will be in&s;pired with an invincible Bravery of Spi|rit, &s;ufficient to &s;upport you under &s;uch Circum|&s;tances of Danger and Di&s;tre&s;s, as the Heroi&s;m of the greate&s;t <HI>Pagans</HI> have failed them in.</P>

the Ble&s;&s;ings of Peace: A Peace which the Arms of <HI>New-England</HI> had no &s;mall influence in re&s;to|ring to our Mother Country, and its Allies. But as <HI>largely</HI> as we contributed to purcha&s;e this Peace, it is not improbable, that we &s;hall feel as early and &s;everely as any, the Con&s;equences of a new War.</P>
<P>You will therefore endeavor, not only to be in|&s;tructed with the exacte&s;t Skill and the brave&s;t Courage your&s;elves, but be indu&s;trious to dif|fu&s;e the&s;e through all Parts of our Land: That &s;o if we &s;hould be called by Providence, to beat our Plow-&s;hares into Swords, and our Pruning-hooks into Spears, there may not be wanting tho&s;e among us, who &s;hall maintain the military Repu|tation which we bear, and greatly merit of their Country, for being the Bulwarks of it.</P>
<P>To conclude, May we all act up to our Cha|racter as Chri&s;tians: May the Principles of the Go&s;pel, accompanied with the Energy of God's good Spirit, influence and form our Temper and Conduct: May they in&s;pire us with that true For|titude, which &s;hall make us intrepid in the Path of Duty, and enable us to vanqui&s;h our &s;piritual Enemies; with that Benevolence and public Spirit, which &s;hall lead us to &s;erve God, by &s;erving our Generation, in the various Stations a&s;&s;igned us by Providence. In this Way, the lowe&s;t and the meane&s;t in the pre&s;ent State, may expect to ap|pear with di&s;tingui&s;hed Advantage upon the Stage of Immortality.</P>
