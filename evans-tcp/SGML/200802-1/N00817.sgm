<P>And at the day of Election, when they have before hand enjoyned their followers who they &s;hall chu&s;e for A&s;&s;embly men, they cry out to the People, <HI>Stand up for your Priviledges,</HI> That is, to chu&s;e us for A&s;&s;embly men, for if you chu&s;e the worlds people, you will &s;oon have a Militia to maintain, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and you may have Prie&s;ts to maintain too, who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters"> hurt our cau&s;e and draw the People from Truth that is, from us and our cau&s;e.
