<P>With a view of promoting the intere&s;ts of hu|manity, a number of re&s;pectable Citizens have a&s;&s;ociated under the name of "<HI>THE HUMANE SOCIETY OF THE STATE OF NEW-YORK,</HI> and have agreed to the following <HI>Con&s;titution</HI>:&mdash; which is now &s;ubmitted to the con&s;idera|tion of their Fellow-Citizens. Experience in &s;ome of our &s;i&s;ter States, as well as in in Europe, has evinced, that &s;imilar in&s;titu|tions have been attended with the mo&s;t hap|py effects. It cannot be doubted, but the &s;ame generous and laudable &s;pirit which has been &s;o often exerted by the inhabitants of this State, will be di&s;played, in &s;upporting an In&s;titution, which can have no other ob|ject in view than benevolence to mankind.</P>

<HEAD>ADDRESS TO THE CITIZENS.
Fellow Citizens of the City and State of New-York.</HEAD>
<P>THE numerous &s;udden deaths, from various cau&s;es, of which every year furni&s;h|es examples, &s;hould excite the attention of every humane and well regulated communi|ty. The value of life mu&s;t be felt among all nations; even among tho&s;e who make the de&s;truction of it their &s;tudy and occupation. But in a country, where, from the happy organization of its government, the worth of man is duly appreciated, and where agri|culture and commerce form his chief bu&s;i|ne&s;s, life obtains a higher e&s;timation, and a&s;&s;umes a more di&s;tingui&s;hed importance. It were, &s;uperfluous, therefore, on this occa|&s;ion, to expatiate on the propriety of any in&s;titution which has for its object the pre|&s;ervation and continuance of exi&s;tence: Equally &s;uperfluous would it be, to appeal
<PB N="10" REF="029202_0010_0FDFCA2DC8322118">to Europe, for precedents to e&s;tabli&s;h the propriety of an undertaking like that in which we have engaged.&mdash;That in many ca&s;es of <HI>apparent</HI> death, life has afterwards been di&s;covered to be pre&s;ent;&mdash;that, by the application of proper means, thou&s;ands have been re&s;cued from the &s;tate of appa|rent death, and re&s;tored to the wi&s;hes and embraces of their families and friends;&mdash; that &s;ome regular plan is be&s;t fitted to effect this de&s;irable re&s;toration,&mdash;and that A&s;&s;o|ciations of the nature of the pre&s;ent in&s;titu|tion, are mo&s;t effectual for the accompli&s;h|ment of that purpo&s;e;&mdash;are facts which ad|mit of no di&s;pute; and which, had no pri|or e&s;tabli&s;hment of the like nature ever been formed, are &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify, and render important in the view of all men our pre&s;ent undertaking.</P>
<P>In a City like this, and in a State &s;o ex|ten&s;ive, and &s;o expo&s;ed to all tho&s;e accidents which actually occa&s;ion &s;udden <HI>apparent death</HI>; it is a matter of &s;erious regret, that &s;o little of this kind has hitherto been at|tempted; and that this little has produced no effect, as far as has come to our know|ledge. Indeed the only provi&s;ion made for the re&s;toration of per&s;ons from a &s;tate of apparent death, appears to us not only wholly inadequate, but for the mo&s;t part,
<PB N="11" REF="029202_0011_0FDFCA6EC3E2B488">ab&s;olutely pernicious. And hence we are the more &s;trongly incited to pur&s;ue our de&s;ign; &s;ince it is evident that while the expectations of the Citizens are placed on that which can &s;erve no good end, the hope of any benefit from attempts at re&s;to|ration, thus conducted, mu&s;t be delu&s;ory and vain.&mdash;To afford &s;ome more cer|tain hope, &s;omething on which the Public may rely with greater a&s;&s;urance of effect and advantage, we offer the following di|rections, as the re&s;ult of our mo&s;t diligent enquiry into the &s;ubject; giving notice at the &s;ame time, that the objects of our a&s;|&s;ociation will never be lo&s;t &s;ight of,&mdash;and that we &s;hall continue to publi&s;h from time to time, &s;uch additional information, both on the &s;ubject of re&s;u&s;citation and on other matters, connected with the public health, as may re&s;ult from a more enlarged &s;phere of ob&s;ervation, from more exten&s;ive per|&s;onal experience, and from the labours of the learned in various parts of the world.</P>

<HEAD>NOTICE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Directions are the re&s;ult of careful attention to the various &s;ubjects to which they relate. Particular re&s;pect has been paid to the reports of the <HI>Humane So|cieties</HI> of America and Europe.&mdash;The greate&s;t attention was due to the ingenious and &s;ucce&s;s|ful experiments, and to the publications of tho&s;e Phy&s;icians and Philo&s;ophers who have made the&s;e u&s;eful inquiries their favourite &s;tu|dy&mdash;<HI>The Medical Coun&s;ellors</HI> have duly at|tended to the late&s;t <HI>di&s;coveries and improve|ments in Medicine, added tho&s;e ob&s;er|vations which they have found mo&s;t &s;afe and &s;ucce&s;sful in this kind of practice in repeat|ed trials,</HI> and avoided <HI>Technical terms</HI> as much as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The <HI>Facts</HI> are arranged in the mo&s;t plain and ea&s;y manner, &s;o as to be put into practice by all who are able to read, and will pay proper attention to the very u&s;eful and highly important objects of the &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Sudden apparent death <HI>may ari&s;e from</HI> drowning, hanging, drinking cold liquors, and eating ices in warm weather, the vapours of wells, cellars, fermenting liquors, and from the fumes of burning charcoal, and various metallic &s;ub&s;tances; from lightning; from ex|po&s;ure to exce&s;&s;ive heat or cold; from confined rooms, and various other cau&s;es.</P>

<P N="1">1. The body &s;hould be taken out of the water with as much care and tenderne&s;s as the circum&s;tances will permit; endeavor|ing always to keep the head rai&s;ed a little more than the body.</P>
<P>In every ca&s;e, hanging it by the heels, under the erroneous &s;uppo&s;ition of di&s;charg|ing water from the lungs, rolling it on a bar|rel, or putting it acro&s;s a log, and every kind of jolting and &s;haking, mu&s;t be ab&s;olutely avoided as extremely injurious.</P>
<P N="2">2. The body &s;hould be carried <HI>on a wide board, or in &s;ome other ea&s;y manner</HI> to the neare&s;t convenient place, into as <HI>large a room</HI> as can be had; the clothes mu&s;t be imme|diately taken off, the whole &s;kin wiped dry with flannel and examined &s;o as to determine whether any wounds have happened to it, and the body &s;hould then be wrapped up in <HI>warm blankets.</HI> It &s;hould then be laid on a table, if at hand, with the head a little rai&s;ed, and if the weather be cold, before a fire. All crowds of people mu&s;t be kept off; and no more than <HI>&s;ix per&s;ons</HI> mu&s;t ever

<HI>Of drinking Cold Liquors, and eating Ices in hot weather.</HI></HEAD>
<P>To prevent the bad effects of Cold Liquors.</P>
<P N="1">1. It will be be&s;t never to drink while very hot: or,</P>
<P N="2">2. To drink a little at a time, holding it in the mouth &s;ome moments before &s;wal|lowing: or,</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="21" REF="029202_0021_0FDFCA7C5A211A28">3. To hold the ve&s;&s;el &s;ome moments with both hands, till the liquor may be &s;up|po&s;ed to be tempered: or,</P>
<P N="4">4. To wa&s;h the hands and face, and rin&s;e the mouth and throat before drinking; and then to drink moderately, and often repeat it.</P>
<P>The eating of ices having become a fa&s;hionable luxury in hot weather, it is the more nece&s;&s;ary to mention the bad effects of this practice: In general, they are apt to produce <HI>cholic, cholera morbus, and dy&s;en|tery,</HI> or &s;ome other <HI>di&s;ea&s;e</HI> of the <HI>&s;tomach and bowels</HI>; and frequently in <HI>women,</HI> e&s;pecial|ly tho&s;e of a <HI>delicate habit,</HI> this practice produces a <HI>&s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the men&s;es,</HI> and an <HI>en&s;uing lo&s;s of health.</HI></P>
<P>In many ca&s;es the taking of ices will be highly <HI>&s;alutary.</HI> In &s;ome di&s;ea&s;es they may be u&s;ed with great advantage, as in <HI>burn|ing, or inflammatory fevers,</HI> and for <HI>local applications</HI> in certain other di&s;ea&s;es; but they never can be &s;wallowed with &s;afety, unle&s;s the following cautions be attended to: viz.</P>
<P N="1">1. Hold the ve&s;&s;el in the hands of few mo|ments before taking the ice into the mouth.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="22" REF="029202_0022_0FDFCA40D0D6F960">2. Let the ice, particularly ice Creams, be completely di&s;&s;olved in the mouth be|fore it be &s;wallowed. This many are apt to neglect, on account of its producing pain in the teeth; but if the ice &s;hould be conveyed into the &s;tomach, it will produce a much more &s;erious evil than the tooth-ach.</P>
<P N="3">3. All per&s;ons in health, who regale them&s;elves with the eating of ices, as a mere delicacy in the warm &s;ea&s;on; immediate|ly after taking them, &s;hould &s;wallow a gla&s;s of wine, or &s;ome &s;pirituous drink.</P>
<P>To remove the bad effects when they have taken place.</P>
<P N="1">1. Immediately cau&s;e the patient to drink a gla&s;s of &s;ome &s;pirituous liquor.</P>
<P N="2">2. If laudanum can be had, let him take from 10 to 100 drops, according to his age, habits, and the violence of the pain. N. B. People habituated to the u&s;e of ardent &s;pirits, require much larger do&s;es of laudanum than others; but in all ca&s;es it will be &s;afe&s;t to u&s;e other &s;timulants, on account of the bad effects of large do&s;es of opiate medicines.</P>
<P N="3">3. Let the patient be removed to a

<P N="5">5. If the per&s;on be apparently dead, proceed as in the ca&s;e of drowning.</P>

<PB N="35" REF="029202_0035_0FDFCA8F3209E020">Let him drink freely of cool water at the time of intoxication, and &s;wallow a few &s;poonfuls of olive oil, or &s;ome other mild oil; but afterwards, when he begins to &s;uf|fer debility and &s;ickne&s;s at his &s;tomach, let the &s;timulus of ardent &s;pirits be changed for &s;omething more durable, &s;uch as good &s;oup, well &s;ea&s;oned with &s;alt and pepper, occa&s;i|onally u&s;ing &s;ome cordial drink, which the effect of habit in tho&s;e who have made too free a u&s;e of &s;trong liquors, will often ab&s;o|lutely require; exerci&s;e, and even labour in proportion to the &s;trength of the patient, &s;hould al&s;o be enjoined.</P>
<P>There are but few who have re&s;olution enough to conquer a tipling habit; but this number would be greater if they knew how to proceed; for their benefit the following advice is offered.</P>
<P>The only effectual method to get rid of habitual intoxication is, to <HI>dimini&s;h the quantity of &s;trong liquor daily and gradually, which, with inflexible re&s;olution,</HI> will de&s;troy the habit; or to <HI>change the &s;timulus of &s;trong liquors for &s;omething more durable, and which is not endued with any &s;tupifying property</HI>: For this purpo&s;e, proper food &s;hould be taken, and an <HI>electuary</HI> compo&s;ed of the
<PB N="36" REF="029202_0036_0FDFCA549E1E4808"><HI>powder of Peruvian bark, wild valerean, or Columbo root,</HI> with the <HI>oil of Cloves,</HI> or &s;ome other <HI>e&s;&s;ential oil,</HI> has, in many ca&s;es, been found very u&s;eful; <HI>a piece as large as a nut|meg,</HI> &s;hould be taken &s;everal times in the day, <HI>e&s;pecially when a &s;inking faintne&s;s is felt at the &s;tomach.</HI></P>
<P>All who have &s;tudied the nature and properties of the &s;tomach, know that the tone of that organ is de&s;troyed by the ex|ce&s;&s;ive u&s;e of &s;trong liquors; the liquor of the &s;tomach becomes vitiated and &s;our, and the food is con&s;equently not properly di|ge&s;ted and converted into good nouri&s;hment, &s;o that the whole body &s;oon becomes in|jured.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation, one of the be&s;t things that can be done, is to ab&s;tain entirely from from all &s;pirituous liquors; &s;uch as rum, gin, brandy, whi&s;key, Roman and hot purl, mint juleps, and all other mixtures of &s;pirituous drinks, many of which are rendered &s;till more pernicious by being mixed with metalic and other poi&s;onous &s;ub|&s;tances.</P>
<P>To relieve the patient from &s;ome of the&s;e evils, the <HI>newly expre&s;&s;ed juice of lemons or limes</HI> has been found very &s;erviceable; but
<PB N="37" REF="029202_0037_0FDFCA9109BFF4D8">what is much better, let him take from twenty to one hundred drops of the <HI>&s;pirit of hart&s;horn,</HI> in a &s;mall cup of water, &s;everal times in the day; this will tend to de&s;troy the morbid acid in the &s;tomach, and to keep out the wind, as dram-drinkers expre&s;s it, much more effectually than drams them|&s;elves, and by being a &s;ub&s;titute for the &s;ti|mulus of the &s;tupifying liquors, it will pre|vent languor, faintne&s;s and that dejection of mind, which too frequently drive the re&s;tle&s;s victim to the delu&s;ive relief of the bowl and the gla&s;s.</P>
<P>Temperance in eating &s;hould al&s;o be &s;trictly ob&s;erved, the want of which is often, productive of as bad, or even wor&s;e effects than intemperance in drinking.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons who fall &s;acrifices to the&s;e habits generally imagine that they are troubled with <HI>bilious di&s;orders</HI>; and of their own choice, or by the fooli&s;h advice of others, as ignorant as them&s;elves, they fly, for eve|ry little unea&s;ine&s;s ari&s;ing from the derange|ment of the dige&s;tive organs, to the u&s;e of <HI>emetics,</HI> by which they are but too often hurried out of exi&s;tence, e&s;pecially when this is accompanied with a <HI>liberal u&s;e of the lancet.</HI></P>

<P>The&s;e &s;ometimes produce the common appearances of death, while the patient is in a recoverable condition. As the&s;e events ari&s;e from &s;ome peculiar &s;tate of the imagi|nation, violent operations of the pa&s;&s;ions, or from &s;ome di&s;ea&s;e of an earlier date, as Epilep&s;y, catalep&s;y, hy&s;terics, &amp;c. no ve|ry particular directions can be given in this place, except calling for proper help and advice in dangerous ca&s;es, as &s;oon as may be.</P>
<P>And it is always to be remembered, that per&s;ons have &s;ometimes been recovered from <HI>apparent death,</HI> after &s;udden and vio|lent &s;ickne&s;s, as in the ca&s;e of <HI>jail and other malignant fevers.</HI> After the proper methods of recovery have been tried for a &s;ufficient length of time, and without &s;ucce&s;s, the <HI>in|terment</HI> of the body ought to be delayed in all in&s;tances, till evident appearances of a beginning <HI>putrefaction</HI> have taken place, for in almo&s;t all ca&s;es where the body remains apparently whole, <HI>putrefaction</HI> is found to be the only certain evidence of the ab&s;olute extinction of life, or &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of animal motion. If this caution be not properly ob|&s;erved,
<PB N="39" REF="029202_0039_0FDFCA92B0024498">after all the u&s;ual methods of recovery have been tried in vain, the per&s;on may after|wards &s;uffer the <HI>inde&s;cribable horrors</HI> of tho&s;e, who, we have too much rea&s;on not to believe, have, in &s;ome in&s;tances, while the &s;park of life remained in a latent &s;tate, been prema|turely committed to the grave.

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE Con&s;titution of this Society is calculated to embrace a great variety of &s;ubjects of a literary, philo&s;ophical and practical nature, which may lead to the di|minution of human mi&s;ery; and it is pro|per to ob&s;erve, that it is on a more liberal plan than that of any foreign in&s;titution of a &s;imilar nature.</P>
<P>By the 14th article of the Con&s;titution, any per&s;on, either an American Citizen, or Foreigner, without the formality of bal|loting, may become a member, on paying to the Trea&s;urer the annual &s;ub&s;cription, and his name will be enrolled in the li&s;t of Contributors.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e benevolent Citizens who are di&s;|po&s;ed to promote the u&s;eful purpo&s;es of this Infant Society, are reque&s;ted to call on the Secretary or Trea&s;urer, and make them&s;elves members of an In&s;titution which may po&s;&s;i|bly afford the &s;ucce&s;sful means of &s;aving
<PB N="42" REF="029202_0041_0FDFCA5ADB570600">their own lives, or the lives of &s;ome of their deare&s;t friends.</P>
<P>By the 5th article of the Con&s;titution, the Tru&s;tees are to take charge of the funds of the Society. Tho&s;e per&s;ons who&s;e &s;ituati|on does not admit of their becoming active agents in the affairs of the Society, are in|formed, that they have an opportunity for a u&s;eful exerci&s;e of their genero&s;ity, by mak|ing donations to the Society; which will be received by any of the Officers, and care|fully appropriated to accompli&s;h the de&s;igns mentioned in the Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>It is probable that the Society will deem it expedient and u&s;eful, &s;ome time in the en&s;uing year, to offer a <HI>premium</HI> on a prize que&s;tion, to be given out for the examina|tion and di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of per&s;ons of genius and learning, in all places.</P>
<P>There have been no regular reports of the ca&s;es of &s;u&s;pended re&s;piration, that have happened &s;ince this Society was formed;
<PB N="43" REF="029202_0042_0FDFCA99A7696E88">but in future, regular reports will be made at the &s;everal meetings. Various arrange|ments are now made to carry the particular objects mentioned in the Con&s;titution &s;uc|ce&s;sfully into effect.</P>
