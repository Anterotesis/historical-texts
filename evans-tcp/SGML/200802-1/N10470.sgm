<BIBL>GENESIS XIV. 14.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>And when Abram heard that his Brother was taken captive, he armed his trained Servants, born in his own Hou&s;e, three Hundred and eighteen, and pur&s;ued them unto Dan.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE Words teach us, the wi&s;e fore&s;ight of holy Abram, in training his &s;ervants to the u&s;e of arms, in a time of pro|found quiet, when all was peace and &s;erene; left he and all his, &s;hould fall an ea&s;y prey to the ambition or avarice of his enterprizing neighbours. Here al&s;o we perceive the alert|ne&s;s of Abram, when he heard that his brother was taken captive, he immediately arms his &s;ervants and takes the field with his little band;
<PB N="4" REF="013276_0005_0F9049E70087D188">
in which his pious benevolence to his oppre&s;&s;ed kin&s;man &s;hines; he does not delay or he&s;itate, but is alive and in action; he not only arms his &s;ervants, but pu&s;hes forward to Dan. The courage and faith of Abram is not le&s;s con|&s;picuous, in this enterprize, when we recollect, from our context, that the army, which capti|vated his kin&s;man, was now flu&s;hed with uninter|rupted &s;ucce&s;s, in wa&s;ting the neighbour coun|tries, vanqui&s;hing five kings in the vale of Sid|dim; this army was not only numerous, but u&s;ed to battle and conque&s;t: In this view, Abram's courage and faith equals almo&s;t any+thing on &s;acred record, in pur&s;uing &s;uch an army, with his three hundred and eighteen raw &s;oldiers, however well di&s;ciplined; but moved with faith and a de&s;ire to defend the rights of human nature, he pur&s;ues them to Dan.</P>
<P>Still our context furni&s;hes us with a notable &s;troke of Abram's conduct, in which he &s;hews his &s;kill and prudence, as a general, in dividing his little band, that they might appear the more formidable, and in attacking them by night, which added &s;urprize and concealed the &s;mall|ne&s;s of his numbers; and God crowned this attempt with &s;ucce&s;s, &s;o that he &s;mote and pur|&s;ued this powerful army, and recovered the &s;poil and captives out of their hands.</P>
<P>Yet again, Abram is more illu&s;trious in the other part of his conduct, who now being fur|nished
<PB N="5" REF="013276_0006_0F9049E8505DAAB0">
with rich &s;poils, and revered for his glo|rious and &s;urprizing victory over the&s;e powerful kings, had now an opportunity to &s;et him&s;elf up for a king, and en&s;lave his fellow-men in that part of the world; like Nimrod, who, being a mighty hunter, takes the occa&s;ion from his &s;kill and &s;ucce&s;s in killing bea&s;ts, to &s;et up for a king: But we behold Abram &s;hining in his ju&s;tice, genero&s;ity and mercy to the king of Sodom, in re&s;toring to him both &s;poil and captives; and his humility &s;hines al&s;o in re|tiring into private life, thereby manife&s;ting his de&s;ign, in training his &s;ervants, to be a defence of human rights, and not a &s;cheme to aggran|dize or enrich him&s;elf. In the&s;e parts of his conduct Abram far excels <HI>Alexander,</HI> who&s;e glory ro&s;e from his art and &s;ucce&s;s in depriving men of their natural rights: But the glory of the Patriarch Abram, as a victorious general, was his defending and re&s;toring tho&s;e rights to his fellow-men and brethren.</P>
<P>From this bright and &s;triking example of the illu&s;trious Abram, who is the father and pat|tern of believers, we &s;ee it is lawful and ne|ce&s;&s;ary for Chri&s;tians to be trained in the u&s;e of arms.</P>
<P N="1">I. It appears from the pious and excellent example of this holy Patriarch Abram, as father and pattern of all believers, to the end of the world, that it is lawful for Chri&s;tians, as his
<PB N="6" REF="013276_0007_0F9049E871698940">
children, to learn the art of war and u&s;e of arms, for their defence, when the ca&s;e requires it, as did Abram. Here notice, this u&s;e of arms is only lawful from Abram's example, when, like Abram, it &s;erves the defence of human rights, or de&s;troys &s;uch who are un|worthy to live, by rea&s;on of their conduct towards God or man; but is not lawful for the purpo&s;es of avarice and ambition, by which human rights are &s;wallowed up. This did not Abram.</P>
<P N="2">2. The &s;mile of Providence on this conduct of Abram, in pur&s;uing and &s;miting the&s;e four kings, with his handful of trained &s;ervants, gives rea&s;on to believe, that this expedition was of God, as it is recorded in another ca&s;e, <Q>for there fell down many &s;lain, becau&s;e the war was of God.</Q> I Chron. v. 22.</P>
<P N="3">3. The lawfulne&s;s for Chri&s;tians to learn and improve the art of war, may be fairly collected from the an&s;wer of John, the forerunner of Chri&s;t, who came to prepare the way for the go&s;pel kingdom: When <Q>the &s;oldiers likewi&s;e demanded of him, &s;aying, and what &s;hall we do? And he &s;aid unto them, do violence to no man, neither accu&s;e any fal&s;ely, and be content with your wages.</Q> Luke iii. 14.</P>
<P>In this an&s;wer, the go&s;pel Elias, who came to prepare the way of the Lord, and make
<PB N="7" REF="013276_0008_0F9049E956D07828">
his paths &s;traight, does not give the lea&s;t inti|mation that the calling of &s;oldiers was unlawful, or that the go&s;pel kingdom, now at hand, would render &s;uch an employment u&s;ele&s;s, or &s;inful; although &s;uch an intimation &s;eems to be unavoidable (in faithfully an&s;wering the que&s;tion propo&s;ed) if the art of war, and em|ployment of &s;oldiers under the go&s;pel were unlawful and &s;inful. Here the argument is not to be &s;u&s;pected, on the &s;ugge&s;tion, that John might either want courage or faithfulne&s;s in this an&s;wer: The known character of John, as re&s;embling or being the go&s;pel Elias, in his faithful and bold reproofs, refutes this &s;ug|ge&s;tion; and this was manife&s;t, not only in his reproving cruel Herod, but in pointing out to the &s;oldiers the reigning vices, which &s;eem to be entailed on <HI>&s;tanding armies,</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>violence, fal&s;e accu&s;ation,</HI> and <HI>di&s;content with wages;</HI> the demon&s;tration of which we have &s;adly ex|perienced in this Land. Hence, from John's an&s;wer, we may conclude the art of war or bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;oldiers is lawful for Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P N="4">4. The lawfulne&s;s of acquiring art in war, by a chri&s;tian people, may be &s;trictly proved from the nature and rea&s;on of things. For if it be in the nature and rea&s;on of things lawful for Chri&s;tians to enjoy their lives, liberties and property, it mu&s;t be lawful, in the &s;ame nature and rea&s;on of things, to u&s;e the means nece&s;&s;ary to defend and pre&s;erve the&s;e enjoyments; for
<PB N="8" REF="013276_0009_0F9049EA08B6FCD0">
to &s;uppo&s;e a right to life, liberty and property, and no right to the means nece&s;&s;ary for the defence and pre&s;ervation of the &s;ame, is one of the greate&s;t ab&s;urdities in nature. Therefore, in the proceeding view of this point, we may &s;urely conclude, it is lawful for Chri&s;tians to learn and u&s;e the art of war, for their own defence and &s;afety, and the defence and &s;afety of others, as the ca&s;e &s;hall require.</P>
<P>The &s;econd thing before us was, to point out the nece&s;&s;ity for Chri&s;tians, or a chri&s;tian peo|ple, to be trained in the u&s;e of arms.</P>
<P N="1">1. This nece&s;&s;ity may be fairly pointed out, by con&s;idering the common &s;hare Chri&s;tians have with others in human rights and privileges. It being a part of a rea&s;onable creature, and nece&s;&s;arily belongs to his character as &s;uch, to pre&s;erve his life, liberty and property, by all lawful means; then all the proper and lawful means for this end, are nece&s;&s;ary, for all who &s;hare in the&s;e common rights of human nature; for nothing is more di&s;agreeable to common &s;en&s;e, then to &s;uppo&s;e a right to any thing, as belonging to human nature, or men in general, and yet to &s;uppo&s;e it unnece&s;&s;ary to u&s;e the proper means to pre&s;erve this right. Hence it appears needful for Chri&s;tians to u&s;e the art of war as a part of their natural, and &s;o nece&s;&s;ary defence; &s;eeing they lo&s;e none of their natural rights by becoming Chri&s;tians. Now, if any
<PB N="9" REF="013276_0010_0F9049EAC16B24D8">
&s;hould allow, that it belongs to men, as men, to u&s;e all the proper and lawful means to pre|&s;erve their natural rights, and as &s;uch they may u&s;e the art of war; but allow not the nece&s;&s;ity or propriety for Chri&s;tians to u&s;e this means of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation; this is in effect to deny that the common rights of men are allowed and nece&s;&s;ary for Chri&s;tians; one of the mo&s;t &s;trange po&s;itions ever devi&s;ed by mortals.</P>
<P N="2">2. The nece&s;&s;ity for a chri&s;tian people to learn the art of war ri&s;es into view, when it is con&s;idered as the only &s;ure check on de&s;igning and ambitious rulers, who are &s;o often attempt|ing to en&s;lave and oppre&s;s tho&s;e for who&s;e good they are advanced to power and authority, and only can be awed by the evidence that the peo|ple are u&s;ed to the art of war, and therefore have it in their power to right them&s;elves, when the ca&s;e requires it. In this light, the u&s;e of arms, kept up and under&s;tood among a chri&s;tian people is nece&s;&s;ary and va&s;tly important, as a re|&s;traint or check on a&s;piring and wicked rulers: For the be&s;t civil con&s;titution in the world will not re&s;train &s;uch rulers, whil&s;t they have nothing to fear from the power of the people: And what power is there in the people for &s;uch to fear, without &s;kill in war? Truly none. In this view, the art of war, for a chri&s;tian people, to pre&s;erve their own natural, civil and religious rights, is mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary and important; without
<PB N="10" REF="013276_0011_0F9049EB8C66AAD8">
which they may not rea&s;onably expect to enjoy, or tran&s;mit to po&s;terity, their common rights, as a free people; freedom cannot long continue where the authority of the people is lo&s;t. All nations and pa&s;t ages bear witne&s;s to this truth by &s;ad experience. Thus, if we turn our eyes to tho&s;e countries where tyranny reigns, we &s;hall &s;ee the power of the people lo&s;t, and the &s;kill in arms confined to a few mercenaries, as tools to their princes; and by this method lordly power di&s;po&s;es all things according to the will of the prince; which may kind heaven forbid ever being our lamentable ca&s;e!</P>
<P N="3">3. This nece&s;&s;ity, for a chri&s;tian people being trained in the u&s;e of arms, is al&s;o pointed out by the certainty that earth and hell are com|bined to per&s;ecute the people of God. See the Apo&s;tle's declaring this matter, <Q>But as then he that was born after the fle&s;h per&s;ecuted him that was born after the &s;pirit, even &s;o it is now.</Q> Gal. iv. 29. <Q>And when the dragon &s;aw that he was ca&s;t unto the earth, he per|&s;ecuted the woman which brought forth the man-child.</Q> Rev. xii. 13. This rage and combination of earth and hell again&s;t God's true people renders the art of war nece&s;&s;ary for true Chri&s;tians, as a means to pre&s;erve them|&s;elves from the per&s;ecuting fury of evil men, moved with the rage of the old dragon. It is a mo&s;t apparent truth, that in all ca&s;es, the
<PB N="11" REF="013276_0012_0F9049ED89B57940">
means of pre&s;ervation ought in wi&s;dom and prudence to be proportioned to the real danger a people are in. Hence, the more and &s;tronger are their enemies, the greater is the nece&s;&s;ity for a chri&s;tian people to be &s;killed in the art of defence.</P>
<P N="4">4. The ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity for a chri&s;tian peo|ple to learn the art of war opens to our &s;ight, if we only recollect, that without it, a people are in &s;uch a defencele&s;s &s;tate, that their wealth does but expo&s;e them, by encouraging and tempting their ambitious or covetous neighbours to make them a prey; which has often been the ca&s;e. And to prevent this, and other evils, no doubt Abram trained his &s;ervants to the u&s;e of arms. And be&s;ides, the experience of all na|tions in times of war, fully di&s;covers, that neither numbers nor courage, without order and art, are &s;ufficient to protect a nation or people.</P>
<P>This has been remarkably verified in the empire of Ru&s;&s;ia; where they neither wanted courage nor numbers, but art in war; there|fore were ea&s;ily vanqui&s;hed by a handful of well-di&s;ciplined Swedes, until they acquired art in war, by which they recovered them&s;elves, and are now e&s;teemed and revered by their neighbours, and perhaps as good &s;oldiers as any in the world, having of late done &s;uch things in arms, again&s;t the Turks, as will make them
<PB N="12" REF="013276_0013_0F9049EDCCB48870">
famous <HI>in ages to come.</HI> In this light, the nece&s;&s;ity of learning the art of war, for our own defence, &s;trongly urges it&s;elf upon us.</P>
<P N="5">5. The &s;ixth command of the decalogue, "Thou &s;halt not kill," lays this nece&s;&s;ity pow|erfully upon the people of God. For, if they may not be guilty of &s;hedding their own blood, or the blood of others, they mu&s;t u&s;e all proper means to pre&s;erve their own lives, and the lives of others, or el&s;e be acce&s;&s;ory to their own de&s;truction: Now then let Chri&s;tians &s;ee and feel the nece&s;&s;ity of acquiring the art of war, in obedience to God's command, and out of regard to their natural, civil and religious rights, and for &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, and for the pre&s;erva|tion of their deare&s;t&punc; friends and mo&s;t important enjoyments, on earth or in heaven; that in doing this they may have con&s;ciences void of offence toward God and man.</P>
<P N="6">6. The enemies of God's church in the world, that &s;urround his people, acquiring the u&s;e of arms, render it nece&s;&s;ary for the people of God to be trained in like &s;kill. Thus we hear holy king David lamenting over Saul and his &s;ons, who fell by the archers on the moun|tains of Gilboa, and, <Q>He bade them teach the children of Judah the u&s;e of the bow.</Q> Now then, in imitation of king David, we may &s;ay, let the children of New-England learn the u&s;e of the firelock, le&s;t their brave commanders fall by the art of her enemies, on her plea&s;ant
<PB N="13" REF="013276_0014_0F9049EE9352DE70">
mountains, in &s;ome future day; when, like David, too late to &s;ave our brave leaders, we bade teach the u&s;e of fire-arms, and art of war.</P>
<P>Finally, it appears as nece&s;&s;ary for a chri&s;tian people to know and u&s;e the art of war, for their &s;ecurity, as it is to know and u&s;e the art of hu&s;bandry for their &s;upport in life: And it is as rea&s;onable to expect, in ordinary ca&s;es, our provi&s;ion without labour, as our protection without the art of war, or &s;kill in arms. Be|cause God is able to defend his people, without art in war, &s;hall we be carele&s;s, and take no pains to learn the &s;kill of defence? We might as well argue, becau&s;e God is able to provide for his people without work, and &s;ometimes has doneit, asin the wilderne&s;s; therefore we may be idle and commit our&s;elves to Providence: Such rea&s;oning is unworthy of men, or Chri&s;tians. In this &s;hort view of the nece&s;&s;ity for a religious people to learn and improve the arts of war, for their protection; and the importance of this art increa&s;ing as a people increa&s;e in wealth and riches, in fine fields, and fair buildings, is un|deniable. Otherwi&s;e, the increa&s;e or growth of a people will be but the &s;tronger temptation, and richer prey, for &s;ome a&s;piring or covetous Nimrod, &s;killed in the art of war. And it is likely to be our ca&s;e in this land, at no great di&s;tance of time, if we do not, like Abram, train our hou&s;eholds for war, in a time of profound peace and quiet.
<PB N="14" REF="013276_0015_0F9049EF4779D180">
Now we may clo&s;e this di&s;cour&s;e by a few ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is to be ob&s;erved, although it be mo&s;t evidently lawful for a chri&s;tian people to learn and u&s;e the art of war, yet it is only &s;o with regard to lawful war, which is for the defence and recovery of human rights, or as an act of bene|volence to human creatures, and in obedience to the immediate command of God, in executing his ju&s;t vengeance on the wicked. The art of war, as now u&s;ed, to rob and en&s;lave nations, and deprive them of their liberty and property, in order to aggrandize others, is a mo&s;t vile and &s;inful abu&s;e of human &s;kill or art, and ought to be con&s;idered, at this day, in that light, as a &s;ore judgment and &s;courge on the world.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let it be ob&s;erved, that the art of war is not the le&s;s lawful or nece&s;&s;ary for the people of God, becau&s;e others abu&s;e it to deprive their fellow-creatures of their natural rights; but the more lawful and nece&s;&s;ary for them, that they may be the more able to re&s;i&s;t &s;uch abu&s;e of human art, maintain or recover their own rights; for othewi&s;e they would be, without a con&s;tant miracle, in&s;tantly devoured by tho&s;e enemies of human freedom, that dwell around them. And I hope we have none, or at lea&s;t but a very few, who would expect &s;uch a mi|raculous protection at this day. Under this ob&s;ervation we are naturally drawn to &s;urvey a
<PB N="15" REF="013276_0016_0F9049EFEEE40740">
little the &s;weets of life, the almo&s;t divine plea|&s;ure of freedom, the tender and dear relations of nature, the tents of Shem in which we dwell, the fruitful fields that &s;urround us, and quiet dwellings in which we now re&s;t, the hone&s;t earnings of our hands with the &s;weat of our brows, or the patrimony of our dear ance&s;tors. And then turn our thoughts on the gloomy pro&s;pect of a bloody carnage of our dear coun|trymen and friends, in the high places of the field, our wives and children torn from our bo&s;oms, our lives in jeopardy every moment, our liberty turned to &s;lavery, our religious a&s;&s;em|blies the glory of our land no more, our hou&s;es and fields turned to &s;trangers! And all this lo&s;s and mi&s;ery come upon us for our neglect to improve in the u&s;e of arms and art of war! With the&s;e thoughts, who would forbear to imitate Abram in training his &s;ervants, or en|couraging the art of war, as nece&s;&s;ary for a chri&s;tian people; and peculiarly &s;o for this now flouri&s;hing country, that it's growing wealth, in a defencele&s;s &s;tate, tempt not it's enemies to lay it wa&s;te?</P>
<P N="3">3. Hence it is beyond di&s;pute, that an at|tempt to increa&s;e the knowledge of arms among us, at this time, is highly commendable in it&s;elf, and may be of va&s;t and noble con&s;equence, if attended with prudence and care, &s;o that no occa&s;ion may be given, ju&s;tly to complain, that vice is encouraged and increa&s;ed thereby.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="16" REF="013276_0017_0F9049F0CBCCE790">
4. The bu&s;ine&s;s of this day being of this nature, and a free-will offering, is to be ju&s;tly and highly commended, if &s;oberly and wi&s;ely conducted; e&s;pecially, &s;eeing we are in danger, otherwi&s;e, to lo&s;e the u&s;e of arms, it being about eight years &s;ince the military company in this place has been regularly called upon to attend &s;uch exerci&s;es, by the proper officers; which, no doubt, is the ca&s;e through this whole regiment. If this &s;hould continue and &s;pread in other regiments all over the province, and no private care be taken, it would &s;oon render our &s;tate defencele&s;s, in a great mea&s;ure: But to prevent this, may the laudable temper of martial exerci&s;e diffu&s;e it&s;elf through all ranks in the province; and we become a regularly di&s;ciplined, or trained &s;oldiery, that none may be tempted to en&s;lave or &s;poil us, for a prey to them&s;elves.</P>
<P N="5">5. The harmony and readine&s;s of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to tho&s;e who act the part of officers on this occa&s;ion, will put an honor on your per&s;ons, recommend your bu&s;ine&s;s, and be one part of the beauty, as well as profit, in this attempt, to increa&s;e your acquaintance with the nece&s;&s;ary art of war, and without &s;uch harmony your de&s;ign will be fru&s;trated in a great mea&s;ure, and your&s;elves di&s;graced.</P>

or di&s;honor; your honor, in &s;ea&s;onably and &s;oberly returning to your re&s;pective families, as men who would prove that you had no &s;ordid and ba&s;e purpo&s;es to &s;erve, by your meeting together; thus your de&s;ign will appear hone&s;t, &s;incere and prai&s;e-worthy: But if, in&s;tead of this, you &s;pend the evening following &s;uch exerci&s;es at taverns, in drinking and the like deba&s;ing and immoral practices, it will di&s;honor your bu&s;ine&s;s, and give occa&s;ion to &s;peak evil of you and your exerci&s;es, as a &s;ource of cor|ruption, and unworthy to be encouraged by &s;ober men.</P>
<P>Finally, my young brethren, I wi&s;h you may be good &s;oldiers in the u&s;e of arms, for your king and country; but above all, that you may be reminded, by this day's exerci&s;e, of being good &s;oldiers under King Je&s;us; fighting again&s;t all &s;piritual enemies, with &s;piritual arms, for an eternal crown.</P>
