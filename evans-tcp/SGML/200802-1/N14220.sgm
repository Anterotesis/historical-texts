<Q><HI>Wo unto him that &s;triveth with his Maker.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>SIN brings mi&s;ery with and after it. Had man maintained his primitive rectitude, trouble, &s;orrow and death would never have been found among the race of Adam. Ever &s;ince the defection of the fir&s;t human pair from God, there has been a &s;trange pro|pen&s;ity in mankind, to di&s;pute his authority and find fault with his admini&s;tration. Such conduct is highly di&s;honorable, affronting and provoking to the Deity. He is plea&s;ed frequently to animadvert upon it in this world, and &s;ometimes, in a manner very alarming: And will not fail to make all, who per&s;i&s;t in op|po&s;ing him, to feel, &s;ooner or later, the direful effects of his righteous vindictive re&s;entment. <HI>Wo,</HI> &s;aith he in the text, <HI>unto him that &s;triveth with his Maker.</HI> In di&s;cour&s;ing on which I propo&s;e,</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="018009_0004_0FA460E1B2C008F0">
FIRST, To &s;hew <HI>when</HI> men may be &s;aid to <HI>&s;trive with God.</HI></P>
<P>SECONDLY, To con&s;ider the great guilt and danger of <HI>&s;triving with him.</HI></P>
<P>THIRDLY, To apply the &s;ubject to the pre&s;ent very &s;olemn and awful occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>FIRST, I am to &s;hew <HI>when</HI> men may be &s;aid to <HI>&s;trive with God.</HI></P>
<P>THIS I &s;hall do in &s;everal particulars. And,</P>
<P>FIRST, Men <HI>&s;trive with God</HI> when they refu&s;e to &s;ubmit to him as their <HI>Law giver.</HI></P>
<P>HAVING made them he has an ab&s;olute propriety in them, and an indi&s;putable right to enact &s;uch laws for the direction of their conduct as &s;eemeth good to him.</P>
<P>HAPPY it is for us, that this Being, on whom we depend for exi&s;tence, and who has a &s;overeign autho|rity over us, is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all perfection; and there|fore we may be certain, that it never was, and never will be his plea&s;ure to ordain rules for the ob&s;ervance of any of his creatures, which have not their founda|tion in infinite goodne&s;s directed by con&s;ummate wi&s;|dom.</P>
<P>ALL the laws the Supreme Being hath promulgated, and to which he requires our &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, both by the voice of rea&s;on and revelation, are adapted to our ca|pacities, and plainly calculated to advance and &s;ecure our be&s;t welfare, as well as his glory. Indeed, &s;hould the Deity require our obedient regard to a po&s;itive precept, the utility of which we could not compre|hend,
<PB N="7" REF="018009_0005_0FA460E30CFB0750">
we &s;hould be indi&s;pen&s;ably obliged to yield a ready &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to it, not doubting of the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of his de&s;ign therein. His right to give law to us being founded in his ab&s;olute propriety in us, we are bound to obey his precepts from a regard to his authority, exclu&s;ive of any con&s;ideration of &s;uitablene&s;s in the precepts them&s;elves to promote our own felicity. Neverthele&s;s, whenever &s;uch &s;uitable|ne&s;s is apparent in any of his laws, it affords an addi|tional argument for our compliance with them.</P>
<P>IN every allowed in&s;tance of di&s;obedience we prac|tically deny the authority of God over us, and contend with him for dominion.</P>
<P>No partial regard to his commandments is &s;ufficient to &s;ave us from the imputation of <HI>&s;triving with him.</HI> St. James &s;ays, <HI>Whoever &s;hall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.</HI> chap. ii. v. 10. Who&s;oever allowedly and habitually violates any one of the laws of God is guilty of a wicked contempt of his &s;overeignty, and does not obey him in any in&s;tance from a proper affection to him and his government. The language of the practice of every per&s;on of &s;uch a character is, That he will not have God to rule over him&mdash;that he is his own, and will pay no higher re|gard to the laws of the Deity than is con&s;i&s;tent with the gratification of his own irregular and vicious incli|nations.</P>
<P>SECONDLY. Men <HI>&s;trive with God,</HI> when they find fault with the di&s;pen&s;ations of his grace.</P>
<P>THE Father of mankind, in his abundant wi&s;dom, goodne&s;s and mercy, has contrived a method of re|covering them from the ruins of the apo&s;tacy to his favour and happine&s;s. <HI>At &s;undry times and in divers
<PB N="8" REF="018009_0006_0FA460E49010D2D0">
manners</HI> has he made di&s;coveries of his mind and will relating to this plan of grace. In the fulne&s;s of time he &s;ent his only begotten Son into the world to perfect what was wanting in preceeding revelations, and to exhibit to men a clear and full account of all tho&s;e things re&s;pecting their &s;alvation, with which, in this &s;tate of probation, infinite wi&s;dom &s;aw fit to make them acquainted.</P>
<P>THE atte&s;tations given to the revelation contained in the &s;acred &s;criptures of the Old and New Te&s;tament are ample, illu&s;trious, and worthy of God. Every &s;erious, unprejudiced enquirer after truth &s;oon feels their force, and is con&s;trained to acknowledge the divinity of the religion taught in the Bible.</P>
<P>THAT any &s;hould find fault with a &s;cheme of religi|on &s;o benevolent&mdash;&s;o pure&mdash;&s;o honorable to God, and advantageous to men&mdash;&s;o admirably &s;upported by ex|ternal, as well as internal evidence, is an argument of great blindne&s;s and ob&s;tinacy.</P>
<P>To creatures in our circum&s;tances of guilt and de|pravity, who &s;tand in ab&s;olute need of a di&s;pen&s;ation of grace, how welcome ought &s;uch a di&s;pen&s;ation to be! How worthy of the mo&s;t grateful acceptation of <HI>all</HI> men is the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> revelation!</P>
<P>No man, who rejects this revelation, either upon the &s;uppo&s;ition that it is needle&s;s, or on account of any difficulties with which &s;ome of its doctrines are attend|ed, difficulties incomprehen&s;ible by our limited under|&s;tandings; or becau&s;e of the corruptions of its profe&s;|&s;ors; no man, who oppo&s;es or treats it with neglect and contempt, on any account whatever, can excul|pate him&s;elf from the charge of &s;triving with God.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="018009_0007_0FA460E4ECF05D30">
To &s;uppo&s;e &s;upernatural revelation needle&s;s, implies, either a <HI>denial</HI> of a criminal departure in man from the &s;tate of rectitude in which he was originally placed by God; or pre&s;umption, that the uncovenanted good|ne&s;s and mercy of God oblige him to pardon and receive into favour the guilty: Both of which are <HI>incon&s;i&s;tent</HI> with the <HI>light</HI> of <HI>nature.</HI></P>
<P>To reject the Go&s;pel, on account of <HI>my&s;teries</HI> with which &s;ome of it's doctrines are attended, is highly un|rea&s;onable, unle&s;s it be rea&s;onable to reject <HI>all</HI> religion on the &s;ame account. The religion of <HI>nature</HI> is attend|ed with difficulties as incomprehen&s;ible by us as any of the my&s;teries of the Chri&s;tian religion. Yes, if once it be admitted, that we can have no &s;atisfactory evi|dence of the truth of any thing we cannot com|prehend, we mu&s;t then commence univer&s;al &s;cepticks, and doubt of the truth even of our own exi&s;tence, the manner of which is wholly unaccountable to us.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>corruptions</HI> of profe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tians, they are, indeed, a humbling con&s;ideration; but the&s;e corrup|tions the Chri&s;tian religion is not accountable for. It every where di&s;countenances and condemns them; and of all religions, that ever appeared in the world, is the be&s;t calculated to di&s;courage vice, profanen&s;s and im|morality; and to promote the cau&s;e of piety, virtue and righteou&s;ne&s;s. It gives the mo&s;t pure and excel|lent, the cleare&s;t and fulle&s;t in&s;tructions and directions re&s;pecting our temper and behaviour towards God, mankind and our&s;elves, and enforces them with the mo&s;t weighty, pungent and effectual arguments and motives; arguments and motives &s;uperior to any that could have entered the human mind, without a revela|tion from Heaven. And "notwith&s;tanding the cor|ruptions &s;o complained of in the Chri&s;tian world, it is
<PB N="10" REF="018009_0008_0FA460E569911D00">
undeniable, that what there is of knowledge and true religion among men, is principally where Chri&s;tianity is profe&s;&s;ed."</P>
<P>To reject this religion, <HI>wherein God hath abounded to|ward us in all wi&s;dom</HI> and goodne&s;s, is to fight again&s;t him in the mo&s;t criminal and dangerous manner.</P>
<P>MANY profe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tians <HI>virtually</HI> find fault with the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation.</P>
<P>THE doctrines of Chri&s;tianity are truly humiliating&mdash;well calculated to bring down the pride of apo&s;tate men. Sinners, as we are taught in the book of in&s;pi|ration, are <HI>ju&s;tified freely by God's grace, through the re|demption that is in Je&s;us Chri&s;t: whom God hath &s;et forth to be a propitiation, through faith in his blood, to declare his righteou&s;ne&s;s for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins; that he might be ju&s;t and the ju&s;tifier of him that believeth in Je&s;us</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. iii. 24, 25, 26.</NOTE>. This being God's method of ju&s;tifying &s;inners, who&s;oever does not duly attend to it, but, like a &s;elf-&s;ufficient Phari&s;ee, <HI>goes about to e&s;tabli&s;h</HI> his <HI>own righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> is guilty of &s;triving with his Maker, and attempting to force his way to heaven without <HI>&s;ubmitting</HI> him&s;elf <HI>to the righteou&s;|ne&s;s of God.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is another &s;ort of men, who <HI>virtually</HI> find fault with the di&s;pen&s;ation of grace by <HI>&s;itting &s;till,</HI> and endeavouring nothing of a religious nature, becau&s;e of them&s;elves they can do nothing &s;piritually good.</P>
<P>THE great God is &s;overeign in the be&s;towment of his favors; and for wi&s;e rea&s;ons may &s;ee fit, in &s;ome in|&s;tances, &s;uddenly to &s;top &s;inners in their career of wick|edne&s;s, and communicate to them, at once and un&s;ought, the &s;pecial renewing and &s;anctifying influences of the Holy Spirit: But, &s;ince this is not his ordinary way
<PB N="11" REF="018009_0009_0FA460E62EC5BD58">
of dealing with tho&s;e whom he is graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to bring into a &s;aving acquaintance with, and peculiar re|lation to him&s;elf&mdash;&s;ince he has given no particular &s;in|ners any encouragement that he will <HI>pour out his &s;pirit upon them,</HI> unle&s;s they endeavour to <HI>turn at</HI> his <HI>reproof</HI>&mdash;unle&s;s they <HI>&s;trive to enter in at the &s;trait gate</HI>&mdash;unle&s;s they <HI>labor for the meat which endureth unto everla&s;ting life;</HI>&mdash;unle&s;s they attend to the calls and invitations of the go&s;pel, cheri&s;h the good motions he is wont to com|municate to all in common, who are favoured with the go&s;pel, and make &s;ome proper improvement of the means of grace; I &s;ay, &s;ince this is the ca&s;e, every one who fits &s;till, or rather goes on in a cour&s;e of &s;in, neg|lecting and de&s;pi&s;ing the means of grace, faith and re|pentance, with an expectation of being renewed and made happy by the irre&s;i&s;table grace of God, is ju&s;tly chargeable with the &s;in of oppo&s;ing the glorious method of pardon, grace and &s;alvation, publi&s;hed in the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>OTHERS virtually find fault with the di&s;pen&s;ation of the go&s;pel, by depending on &s;uch a faith in the blood of Chri&s;t, for pardon and life everla&s;ting, as does not <HI>work by love, purify the heart</HI> and <HI>overcome the world.</HI> Whil&s;t they profe&s;s to own him as a Prie&s;t, they prac|tically deny him as a King; and may ju&s;tly be ranked with tho&s;e who refu&s;e to yield &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to God as their Law-giver.</P>
<P>THIRDLY, Men <HI>&s;trive with God</HI> when they are unea&s;y with his ordering and di&s;po&s;ing of their circum&s;tances in a temporal view. As</P>
<P N="1">1. WHEN they are di&s;contented with the original con&s;titution of things with re&s;pect to them&s;elves&mdash;&s;uch as the figure of their bodies, the natural powers of their minds, the quality of their parents and relatives, and the infirmities of human nature.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="018009_0010_0FA460E6E4594858">
To complain of &s;uch things, is as wicked and pre|po&s;terous, in any of the human &s;pecies, as to be unea&s;y, becau&s;e they were not created angels and ranked with the highe&s;t order of them. <HI>Shall the thing formed &s;ay to him that formed it, Why ho&s;t thou made me thus? Shall the clay &s;ay to him that fa&s;hioneth it, What make&s;t thou? Or thy work, He hath no hands?</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. ix. 20. I&s;aiah, xlv. 9.</NOTE></P>
<P N="2">2. THEY &s;trive with him in afflictions with which they are threatened or vi&s;ited.</P>
<P N="1">1. WHEN they u&s;e unlawful methods to prevent, &s;upport them&s;elves under, or remove them.</P>
<P>IT is natural to all threatened with calamity, or op|pre&s;&s;ed with trouble, to enquire how they may avoid it, or obtain &s;upport under, or deliverance out of it. But by tho&s;e who have a proper regard for God an un|lawful way of attaining help and deliverance is e&s;teem|ed as no way.</P>
<P>IT is much better to &s;uffer natural evil, than to do moral evil that good may come.</P>
<P>WHEN there is no regular way of deliverance from affliction, it is evidently the will of God, that we &s;hould bear it, patiently, for the pre&s;ent, and quietly wait till he &s;hall plea&s;e to remove it, or open a door for our e&s;|cape. In &s;uch a ca&s;e, to refu&s;e to receive correction&mdash;to take irregular cour&s;es for the purpo&s;e of mitigating our &s;orrows, or to fly out of the world in order to get rid of adver&s;ity, is a daring oppo&s;ition to God, and be|trays great want of manly fortitude and bravery.</P>
<P><HI>Cur&s;e God and die</HI> was the advice of the wife of Job, when he was called to endure a &s;ad &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the

mo&s;t trying calamities: But his an&s;wer was &s;uch, as will forever do him honor, as a man, and a &s;ubject of the divine providential government. He &s;aid unto her, "Thou &s;peake&s;t as one of the fooli&s;h women &s;peak|eth: What? Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and &s;hall we not receive evil?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>How mean and unmanly, in compari&s;on of Job's, is the be|haviour of that gloomy race of mortals, who have recour&s;e to the in&s;truments of death under any &s;evere affliction, who launch out into another world, weary of the plea&s;ures, or impatient under the pains of this? Who without under&s;tanding the value of life, or the true ends of living, contemptuou&s;ly return back to God the pre&s;ent, which he has made, as if, what he, the author of every good gift, had be&s;towed, was a trifle not worth the keeping? Their friends may view with weeping eyes, and even an unrelenting crowd with &s;ome concern, a <HI>mangled</HI> and <HI>disfigured carca&s;e:</HI> But men of larger views will extend their reflections farther, and lament the mi&s;eries of a <HI>wounded Spirit,</HI> which has ru&s;hed unprepared into the pre&s;ence of an incen&s;ed Deity. A gha&s;tly <HI>corp&s;e</HI> will give <HI>them</HI> the lea&s;t touches of compa&s;&s;ion: But to con&s;ider the ca&s;e of a <HI>&s;oul,</HI> that has done a fact which leaves no room for repentance, that has plunged it|&s;elf into an aby&s;s of endle&s;s mi&s;ery; to con&s;ider that a new light is probably let in upon the unbodied mind, a light more &s;harp, powerful and piercing, than even that in&s;trument, which di&s;&s;olved the vital union, and divorced the &s;oul from the body;&mdash;this is what will make the deepe&s;t impre&s;&s;ions upon any <HI>thinking</HI> &s;pectator God has joined &s;oul and body together And <HI>what he has joined together, let no man,</HI> unauthori&s;ed by him, <HI>put a&s;un|der.</HI> To commit &s;elf-murder is an ab&s;olute defiance, or a de&s;|perate di&s;belief of his providence. It is to di&s;mi&s;s <HI>our&s;elves</HI> from this &s;tate of probation, before God thinks fit to di&s;mi&s;s us: It is in effect to tell him, we will not patiently endure the cha&s;ti&s;e|ments, which he wi&s;ely inflicts.</P>
<P>Not &s;o holy Job: He con&s;idered, that he, who &s;ent him into the world, alone knew when he had fulfilled tho&s;e ends for which he &s;ent him: That he alone therefore was a competent judge. when he was to be di&s;charged from any further &s;ervice here, and to be admitted to a better &s;tate. <HI>All my appointed time,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>will I wait, till my change come.</HI></P>

2. MEN <HI>&s;trive with God</HI> in afflictions that are brought upon them, when they are &s;ullen under them.</P>
<P>A mournful &s;en&s;e of afflictions is allowable, if not commendable. Such is the con&s;titution of man, and &s;uch the de&s;ire of happine&s;s implanted in the human brea&s;t by our great Creator, that what "oppo&s;es this de&s;ire, or appears to have that tendency," will be pro|ductive of di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ations, and affect us with grief. Not to be thus affected in a degree &s;omewhat corre&s;pondent to the adver&s;ity with which we are vi&s;ited, would argue a deviation from the regular &s;tate of na|ture.</P>
<P>A due &s;en&s;ibility with re&s;pect to afflictions renders them a proper means of promoting important moral purpo&s;es in the hearts of men.</P>
<P>BUT, there is a wide difference between a <HI>mournful &s;en&s;e</HI> of misfortunes, and <HI>&s;ullenne&s;s</HI> under them: The <HI>former</HI> is &s;uitable to the "law of our creation," and may be a powerful means of introducing into the &s;oul that <HI>Godly &s;orrow,</HI> which <HI>worketh repentance to &s;alvation not to be repented of:</HI> Whereas the <HI>latter</HI> is a <HI>&s;orrow</HI> that <HI>worketh death.</HI></P>
<P>To &s;uffer grief &s;o far to exceed its real cau&s;e as to bear no proportion to it;&mdash;to refu&s;e to be comforted; to give place to melancholy &s;o far as to become unfit|ted for the nece&s;&s;ary duties of life,&mdash;for the thankful enjoyment of the remaining ble&s;&s;ings of goodne&s;s,&mdash;for entertaining worthy thoughts of God, and ju&s;t and be|nevolent &s;entiments with re&s;pect to our fellow-creatures; this is ab&s;olutely wrong: It is an implicit denial of the ju&s;tice, the wi&s;dom, the goodne&s;s of Providence.</P>

<P>GOD <HI>doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men.</HI> Did we not refu&s;e to be drawn <HI>with the cords of love, and the bands of a man,</HI> he would not take har&s;h methods with us.

<P>"AND yet, when he comes to take this cour&s;e with us, he &s;till, like a kind and tender hearted father, aims at our benefit and advantage.

If he &s;ends evils upon us, it is that thereby he may do us &s;ome greater good: If he afflicts us, it is not becau&s;e it is plea&s;ant to him to deal har&s;hly with us, but becau&s;e it is profitable and nece&s;&s;ary for us to be &s;o dealt with: And if at any time he imbitter our lives by mi&s;eries and &s;ufferings, it is becau&s;e he is loth to &s;ee us peri&s;h in plea&s;ant ways, and chu&s;eth rather to be &s;omewhat &s;evere towards us, than &s;uffer us to be utterly undone."</P>

<P>BUT, to pay no attention to the voice of Providence in afflictions, to conduct under them like Pharaoh, who as God multiplied his judgments upon him, <HI>&s;inned yet more, and hardened his heart,</HI> is to &s;trive with God, as if &s;inners were re&s;olved that he &s;hould not have the ma&s;tery.</P>
<P>PERSONS of &s;uch a character have great rea&s;on to fear, le&s;t God &s;hould <HI>let them alone,</HI> le&s;t he &s;hould give them over to judicial <HI>blindne&s;s of mind, and hardne&s;s of heart,</HI> and leave them, without check or controul, to <HI>trea&s;ure up unto them&s;elves wrath again&s;t the day of wrath.</HI> I proceed,</P>

1. THEY are guilty of oppo&s;ing their &s;upreme Lord and Sovereign in tho&s;e methods he is graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to take for the promotion of their be&s;t happine&s;s.</P>
<P>As our lawgiver God may well be con&s;idered as our benefactor. We need directions for the regulation of our temper and behaviour. Being formed with capaci|ties for moral government, we cannot be happy without well ordered actions and inclinations. Such is the na|ture of the divine commands that <HI>in keeping them there is great reward.</HI></P>
<P>A GRAND de&s;ign of the di&s;pen&s;ations of his grace is, to rectify the di&s;orders into which we have run by our di&s;regard to his holy law,&mdash;to reduce us to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his government&mdash;to &s;ettle and e&s;tabli&s;h in our &s;ouls that <HI>kingdom,</HI> which con&s;i&s;ts in <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s, and peace, and joy in the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI></P>

<P>GREATLY alarming is their condition who contend with God: They are chargeable with the guilt of con|temning his infinite Maje&s;ty, vilifying his wi&s;dom, di&s;|paraging his ju&s;tice, abu&s;ing his goodne&s;s and defying his power, as if they were &s;tronger than he.

THE very &s;hocking and execrable deeds perpetrated la&s;t Wedne&s;day morning by a man in this &s;ociety have led me to the ob&s;ervations in this di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>THAT a per&s;on, favoured with Chri&s;tian light and li|berty, who appeared to be an affectionate hu&s;band, and a tender, fond parent, &s;hould, with deliberation and in cool blood, ma&s;&s;acre an amiable wife, and four lovely and promi&s;ing children, and then take away his own life, is an event &s;o extraordinary, &s;urpri&s;ing, and unheard of, that we can &s;carcely believe it a reality, though the corp&s;es of the unhappy woman and children, with the mo&s;t affecting marks of violence upon them, are here pre&s;ent before our eyes.</P>
<P>HAD he left no written account of his intentions and views re&s;pecting the de&s;truction of him&s;elf and family, we &s;hould have been ready to con&s;ider it as the effect of a &s;udden and mo&s;t vehement frenzy. But by his wri|tings he appears to have had it in contemplation for three years.</P>
<P>THE time he fir&s;t fixed upon for carrying into exe|cution his horrid and dete&s;table purpo&s;e was the 18th of la&s;t month. Not long before this he writes thus: "I mean to clo&s;e the eyes of &s;ix per&s;ons thro' perfect humanity, and the mo&s;t endearing fondne&s;s and friend|&s;hip; for mortal father never felt more of the&s;e tender ties than my&s;elf.&mdash;How I &s;hall really perform the ta&s;k I have undertaken I know not 'till the moment arrives; But I believe I &s;hall perform it as deliberately, and as &s;teadily as I would go to &s;upper, or to bed."</P>
<P>IN one of the la&s;t letters he wrote, there is the fol|lowing pa&s;&s;age: "Any man that undertakes any great affair, and at the &s;ame time thinks, ought to be very deliberate indeed; and think and reflect again and again.

On the morning of the &s;ixth of December I ro&s;e before the &s;un, felt calm, and left my wife between &s;leep and wake, went into the room where my infants lay, found them all &s;ound a&s;leep; the means of death were with me, but I had not before determined whether to &s;trike or not, but yet thought it a good opportunity. I &s;tood over them, and a&s;ked my God whether it was right or not, now to &s;trike; but no an&s;wer came: nor I believe ever does to man while on earth. I then examined my|&s;elf, there was neither fear, trembling nor horror about me. I then went into a chamber next to that, to look at my&s;elf in the gla&s;s; but I could di&s;cover no alteration in my countenance or feelings: this is true as God reigns, but for further trial I yet po&s;tponed it." And when the fatal morning was come it does not appear by any one circum&s;tance, but that he &s;et him&s;elf about and went thro' the abominable work of murdering his wife, four children and him&s;elf, with as much &s;teadine&s;s, com|po&s;ure and firmne&s;s as he &s;uppo&s;ed he &s;hould.</P>
<P>What a mon&s;ter of a man was this! What were his principles that could lead him into &s;uch dete&s;table and more than &s;avage conduct? Surely it concerns us to know that we may guard again&s;t and avoid them as mo&s;t pernicious to individuals and &s;ocieties. The&s;e he has left a written account of.</P>
<P>SPEAKING of the Chri&s;tian religion he &s;ays, "It is a mo&s;t benevolent &s;y&s;tem, and would produce grand effects, if it was really believed and univer&s;ally practi&s;ed. I firmly believed it for many years; but my adherence to its pre|cepts when every one el&s;e for&s;ook them, has been my bane on earth: But never mind that, if it is really true I &s;hall be &s;aved by it yet. And now I mu&s;t generou&s;ly own, that I have as many doubts about the truth of that, as I have about the truth of any other &s;cheme of religion,

that ever appeared in the world.&mdash;When I con&s;ider men as Chri&s;tians, I look on them as free agents; I have exa|mined both old and new Te&s;taments, and mu&s;t think <HI>that</HI> is their true meaning and intent. But when I con|&s;ider man as a Dei&s;t, or one that does not believe revela|tion, I think him a perfect machine, and that he can do nothing, but as he is operated upon by &s;ome &s;uperior pow|er&mdash;I have renounced all the popular religions in the world, and mean to die a proper Dei&s;t. I really think that there never was any thing done wrong in the world, but believe that all is right;&mdash;that we are all impell'd to &s;ay and act, every thing that we do &s;ay and act.&mdash;That a tyrant king, or two or three fierce republicans deluging three quarters of the world in blood&mdash;that my killing my family&mdash;that a man's de&s;troying a ne&s;t of wa&s;ps, or a fly, is as much directed by the hand of heaven as the making this whole world was&mdash;And if this is the ca&s;e there is no &s;uch thing as &s;in."</P>
<P>THUS he frankly owns, that he had apo&s;tatized from the Chri&s;tian religion and embraced the principles of dei&s;m and fatali&s;m,&mdash;that he believed men to be meer machines, and God the author of all their actions in &s;uch a &s;en&s;e as to exclude the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;in from the world. The idea of future puni&s;hment he al&s;o rejects, as incon&s;i&s;tent with the goodne&s;s of God, though he &s;ays, "I know by experience there is no want of hells in this &s;tate of things." And &s;eems to be full in the opinion that he and his &s;hall be happy in the future world whether he be right or not in rejecting the Chri&s;|tian revelation.</P>
<P>THESE principles appear to have had a main influ|ence in reconciling him to actions which have a &s;elf|evident criminality in them, and which every man's mind, at fir&s;t view, cannot but abhor and condemn.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="018009_0020_0FA460F1DA31F690">
PRIDE, impatience, and cowardice fir&s;t led him to think of de&s;troying him&s;elf and family, and ope|rated powerfully in bringing him to determine upon it. He had a high opinion of his intellectual abilities; and was unea&s;y with the meanne&s;s of his per&s;onal ap|pearance, and &s;lenderne&s;s of his fortune. He writes, "My per&s;on is &s;mall and mean to look on, and my circum&s;tances were always rather narrow; which were great di&s;advantages in this world: But I have great rea&s;on to think that my &s;oul is above the common mould.&mdash;There are but few men capable of dei&s;m; they are when found like a diamond among a million of pebbles."</P>
<P>HE murmured and complained of Providence in the following language: "I was determined not to ha&s;ten the matter" (of de&s;troying him&s;elf and family) "but kept hoping that yet Providence would turn up &s;ome thing to prevent it, if the intent were wrong: but in|&s;tead of that every circum&s;tance, from the greate&s;t to the &s;malle&s;t trifle, during the whole of that term" (i. e. three years) "and long before, only tended to convince me that the utmo&s;t malevolence of fortune was, and is, again&s;t me, on earth. I have born the "&s;tings and ar|rows of outrageous fortune" long enough; and "by oppo&s;ing I can only end them."</P>
<P>BEING too haughty to &s;ubmit to the humbling di&s;|pen&s;ations of Providence, and not having fortitude and courage enough to encounter and &s;u&s;tain the inconve|niencies ari&s;ing from &s;traitened circum&s;tances, he enter|tained the <HI>cowardly</HI> thought of flying from them and taking &s;anctuary in the unknown world: But the guilt and danger of &s;uch conduct, upon &s;uppo&s;ition of the truth of the &s;acred &s;criptures, were to apparent to &s;uffer him to re&s;olve upon it, before he had brought him&s;elf
<PB N="23" REF="018009_0021_0FA460F239EE0C30">
to di&s;believe and reject them. And to render it &s;till le&s;s hazardous in his view he gave into the fatali&s;tic &s;cheme, judging God to be &s;o far the author of all the actions of men as to allow them no other agency than that of meer machines; and upon this Hypothe&s;is concluded that there is no &s;in. In which he is doubtle&s;s more con&s;i&s;tent than tho&s;e who admit the &s;ame hypothe&s;is, and yet hold that men are ac|countable for their conduct.</P>
<P>BUT even &s;uch a view of the actions of men, added to his profe&s;&s;ed di&s;belief of the Revelation of the Bible and future puni&s;hment, was not &s;ufficient fully to &s;a|tisfy him with re&s;pect to his &s;afety in perpretating deeds &s;o unnatural and atrocious; and therefore he called in the aid of fanatici&s;m and &s;uper&s;tition.</P>
<P>IN one of his letters he &s;ays, "You may believe the hand of heaven is in this matter. I u&s;ed to be a great enemy to &s;uper&s;tition: But, however it is, I have lately had &s;undry intimations, I really think, from God to convince me that I am right; but the&s;e I &s;hall not de&s;cribe.&mdash;I mentioned before, that my wife had a dream concerning this affair," (which in another pa|per, dated November 18, he relates in the&s;e words: "Ye&s;terday morning &s;he told me her dream&mdash;that &s;he thought I had wrote many papers, and was earne&s;tly concerned about her&mdash;that the&s;e papers were &s;potted with blood&mdash;that &s;he al&s;o &s;aw a man wound him&s;elf pa&s;t recovery; and blood guggle (as &s;he expre&s;&s;ed it) from different parts of his body. Poor woman! She little thought that the greater part of that dream would be realized within three days&mdash;But I am unappalled and think the hand of heaven is really with us.") "She has &s;ince had two more&mdash;one of them, That &s;he was &s;uddenly &s;eized, and liable to great puni&s;hment&mdash;that it
<PB N="24" REF="018009_0022_0FA460F2EA60B970">
created great confu&s;ion; but &s;he afterwards got free and was happy. From her excellence of heart I have no doubt but this will be the ca&s;e with her. On the thank&s;giving night &s;he dreamed that her three daughters all lay dead, and they even froze in that &s;ituation; and even yet I am little affected. O my God, wonderful indeed are thy works; in the highe&s;t wi&s;dom ha&s;t thou contrived them all! All mu&s;t be right, or I am har|dened indeed.&mdash;Some of the&s;e will be called the &s;ug|ge&s;tions of the devil: But men may rely upon it, that I have ever tru&s;ted in a much higher power; and 'tis he alone that now directs me and &s;upports me."</P>
<P>IN another letter, &s;peaking of the intended ma&s;&s;acre of him&s;elf and family, he &s;ays: "In fine clear days, when I am mo&s;t chearful, and in a morning when I fir&s;t wake, free from any di&s;turbance, I &s;eem to be convinced in a &s;teady, calm and rea&s;onable way, that it is appointed for me to do it&mdash;that it is my duty and that it mu&s;t be done. That it is God him&s;elf that prompts and directs me, in all my reflections and circum&s;pection, I really believe. But if it &s;hould at la&s;t prove <HI>Mr.</HI> Devil, or any other evil &s;pirit, all that I can &s;ay about it is, that I was born a very unlucky fellow."</P>
<P>DREADFUL delu&s;ion! Strange incon&s;i&s;tencies! Hor|rid bla&s;phemy! How &s;urprizing is it, that a man, who rejects the infallible evidences in favour of the divinity of the Chri&s;tian religion, a religion which he allows to be <HI>mo&s;t benevolent,</HI> and with whom it &s;eems to be a maxim, that God never makes an extraordinary revela|tion of him&s;elf to man while upon earth, &s;hould pretend, and be confident, that He has given him &s;undry inti|mations that he is <HI>right</HI> in forming, and taking mea&s;ures to carry into execution, de&s;igns con|demned by the light of nature as <HI>ab&s;olutely wrong,</HI>

and which no man&punc; <HI>who&s;e con&s;cience is not &s;eared as with a hot iron,</HI> can think of without abhorrence!

Such dreams, related in the manner we may &s;uppo&s;e they were by her, had a natural tendency to move the tender pa&s;&s;ions, and give a check to his pernicious de&s;igns. This he &s;eemed to be aware of, and con&s;ider|ed his being <HI>unaffected</HI> and <HI>unappalled</HI> as owing either to &s;upernatural divine help and &s;upport, or to his own hardne&s;s; the <HI>latter</HI> he would not admit: How a&s;to|ni&s;hing that he could imagine it to be the <HI>former!</HI></P>
<P>BUT why do I &s;ay a&s;toni&s;hing? Can any thing be &s;o in one, who, in an enlightened age, &s;o far &s;ets him&s;elf again&s;t God as to reject a revelation attended with all the evidence, both internal and external, of it's divine original, that the nature of the thing will admit?</P>

<HEAD>A LETTER from a Gentleman in We|thersfield, to his Friend, containing a Narrative of the Life of William Bea|dle (&s;o far as it is known) and the par|ticulars of the Ma&s;&s;acre of him&s;elf and Family.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>'TIS not &s;trange that reports various and contradictory &s;hould have circulated on &s;o intere&s;ting and terrible a &s;ubject as that of a man's con&s;igning to the grave him&s;elf and family in a moment of apparent ea&s;e and tranquility. The agita|tion of mind which mu&s;t be the con&s;equence of being near &s;uch a &s;cene of horror, will &s;ufficiently apologize for not an&s;wering your reque&s;t for the particulars e'er this. Our ignorance of the hi&s;tory of this man at fir&s;t precluded a po&s;&s;ibility of giving you &s;atisfaction on this head. Perhaps no one in this town had more favorable opportunities of obtaining the particulars of his hi&s;to|ry: yet, could never induce him to mention a &s;ingle &s;yllable re|lating to his age, parentage, or early occupation. To have a&s;ked him directly would have been rude when he evidently meant to be &s;ilent on the&s;e &s;ubjects. My conjecture was, that he was the natural &s;on of &s;ome gentleman in England, and that he had been brought up in or near London, and had been about the Court. Since his decea&s;e have been able to learn from undoubt|ed authority, that he was born in the county of E&s;&s;ex, in a vil|lage not very far from London. As to his bu&s;ine&s;s in youth am &s;till left in the dark, but find he has once mentioned to a gentle|man, &s;ome little incidents which happened to him while in com|pany with his father, and that he very early became acquaint|ed with a club in London who were Dei&s;ts, where 'tis probable he received the fir&s;t rudiments in tho&s;e principles. While in England, where he left a mother and &s;i&s;ter, he had a fair cha|racter for integrity and hone&s;ty. In the year 1755 he went out to the i&s;land of Barbadoes, in the family of Charles Pinfold, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR>
<PB N="32" REF="018009_0029_0FA460FA96674E48">
Governor of that i&s;land, where he tarried &s;ix years, then re|turned to England, purcha&s;ed &s;ome merchandize, and from thence came to New-York in the year 1762, and immediately removed to Stratford in this State, from thence to Derby, and then to Fairfield, where he married and dwelt &s;ome years.&mdash;By this time he had acquired about twelve hundred pounds pro|perty, with which he removed to this town, about ten years &s;ince, where he re&s;ided until his death. His bu&s;ine&s;s was that of retailing, he formerly credited his goods, but &s;ince his re&s;i|dence in this town he has refu&s;ed to give any credit, intending to keep his property within his own reach, believing it always &s;ecure while his eye was upon it. While here he added con&s;ide|rable to his &s;tock, none of which he ever ve&s;ted in real e&s;tate; the Continental currency taught him that wealth could take to it&s;elf wings and fly away: Notwith&s;tanding all his vigilance.</P>
<P>When the war commenced he had on hand a very hand&s;ome a&s;&s;ortment of Goods for a country &s;tore, which he &s;old for the currency of the country, without any advance in the price&punc; the money he laid by, waiting and expecting the time would &s;oon arrive when he might therewith replace his goods, re&s;olving not to part with it until it &s;hould be in as good demand as when re|ceived by him. His expectations from this quarter daily le&s;&s;en|ing, finally lo&s;t all hope, and was thrown into a &s;tate little better than di&s;pair, as appears from his writtings; he adopted a plan of the mo&s;t rigid family oeconomy, but &s;till kept up the out|ward appearance of his former affluence, and ever to the la&s;t entertained his friend with his u&s;ual decent ho&s;pitality, although nothing appeared in his outward deportment, which evinced the uncommon pride of his heart; his writings &s;hew clearly that he was determined not to bear the mortification of being thought by his friends poor and dependent. On this &s;ubject he expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf in the following extraordinary manner: "If a man, who has once lived well, meant well and done well, falls by un|avoidable accident into poverty, and then &s;ubmits to be laughed at, de&s;pi&s;ed and trampled on, by a &s;et of mean wretches as far below him as the moon is below the &s;un; I &s;ay, if &s;uch a man &s;ubmits, he mu&s;t become meaner than meanne&s;s it&s;elf, and I &s;incerely wi&s;h he might have ten years added to his natural life to puni&s;h him for his folly."</P>
<P>He fixed upon the night &s;ucceeding the 18th of November for the execution of his nefarious purpo&s;e, and procured a &s;upper of oy&s;ters, of which the family eat very plentifully; that evening he writes as follows: "I have prepared a noble &s;upper of oy&s;ters, that my flock and I may eat and drink together, thank God and die." After &s;upper he &s;ent the maid with a &s;tudied errand to a friend's hou&s;e at &s;ome di&s;tance, directing her to &s;tay until &s;he
<PB N="33" REF="018009_0030_0FA460FB29006A08">
obtained an an&s;wer to an in&s;ignificant letter he wrote his friend intending &s;he &s;hould not return that evening&mdash;&s;he did however return, perhaps her return di&s;concerted him and prevented him for that time. The next day he carried his pi&s;tols to a &s;mith for repair; it may be, the ill condition of his pi&s;tols might be an ad|ditional rea&s;on for the delay.</P>
<P>On the evening of the 10th of December &s;ome per&s;ons were with him at his hou&s;e, to whom he appeared as chearful and &s;erene as u&s;ual; he attended to the little affairs of his family as if nothing uncommon was in contemplation. The company left him about nine o'clock in the evening, when he was ur|gent as u&s;ual for their &s;tay; whether he &s;lept that night is un|certain, but it is believed he went to bed. The children and maid &s;lept in one chamber; in the grey of the morning of the 11th of December he went to their bed chamber, awaked the maid and ordered her to ari&s;e gently without di&s;turbing the children; when &s;he came down &s;tairs he gave her a line to the family phy|&s;ician, who lived at the di&s;tance of a quarter of a mile, ordered her to carry it immediately, at the &s;ame time declaring that Mrs. Beadle had been ill all night, and directing her to &s;tay until the phy&s;ician &s;hould come with her; this he repeated &s;un|dry times with a degree of ardor. There is much rea&s;on to be|lieve he had murdered Mrs. Beadle before he awaked the maid. Upon the maid's leaving the hou&s;e he immediately proceeded to execute his purpo&s;e on the children and him&s;elf. It appears he had for &s;ome time before, carried to his bed &s;ide every night an ax and a carving knife; he &s;mote his wife and each of the chil|dren with the ax on the &s;ide of the head as they lay &s;leeping in their beds; the woman had two wounds in the head, the &s;cull of each of them was fractured; he then with the carving knife cut their throats from ear to ear; the woman and little boy were drawn partly over the &s;ide of their beds, as if to prevent the bedding from being be&s;meared with blood; the three daughters were taken from the bed and laid upon the floor &s;ide by &s;ide, like three lambs, before their throats were cut; they were covered with a blanket, and the woman's face with an handkerchief. He then proceeded to the lower floor of the hou&s;e, leaving marks of his foot&s;teps in blood on the &s;tairs, carrying with him the ax and knife, the latter he laid upon the table in the room where he was found, reeking with the blood of his family. Perhaps he had thoughts he might u&s;e it again&s;t him&s;elf if his pi&s;tols &s;hould fail; it appears he then &s;eated him&s;elf in a Wind&s;or chair, with his arms &s;upported by the arms of the chair; he fix|ed the muzles of the pi&s;tols into his two ears and fired them at the &s;ame in&s;tant: the balls went through the head in tran&s;ver&s;e directions. Although the neighbours were very near and &s;ome
<PB N="34" REF="018009_0031_0FA460FDDE107110">
of them awake, none heard the report of the pi&s;tols. The capi|tal facts of the ma&s;&s;acre you have &s;een in the public papers; a minute detail was too horrible to be given at fir&s;t, until the mind (e&s;pecially of the relatives of the unhappy woman) had been pre|pared for it by a &s;ummary narrative, and even now 'tis enough to give feelings to apathy it&s;elf to relate the horrid tale.</P>
<P>The line to the phy&s;ician ob&s;curely announced the intentions of the man; the hou&s;e was &s;oon opened, but alas too late! The bodies were pale and motionle&s;s, &s;wimming in their blood, their faces white as mountain &s;now, yet life &s;eemed to tremble on their lips; de&s;cription can do no more than &s;aintly ape and trifle with the real figure.</P>
<P>Such a tragical &s;cene filled every mind with the deepe&s;t di&s;|tre&s;s; nature recoiled and was on the rack with di&s;torting pa&s;&s;ions; the mo&s;t poignant &s;orrow and tender pity for the lady and her innocent babes, who were the haple&s;s victims of the brutal, &s;tudied cruelty of an hu&s;band and father, in who&s;e em|braces they expected to find &s;ecurity, melted every heart.&mdash;Shock|ing effects of pride and fal&s;e notions about religion.</P>
<P>To paint the fir&s;t tran&s;ports this affecting &s;cene produced, when the hou&s;e was opened, is beyond my reach.&mdash;Multitudes of all ages and &s;exes were drawn together by the &s;ad tale.&mdash;The very in mo&s;t &s;ouls of the beholders were wounded at the &s;ight, and torn bycontending pa&s;&s;ions: Silent grief, with marks of a&s;toni&s;h|ment, were &s;ucceeded by furious indignation again&s;t the author of the affecting &s;pectacle, which vented it&s;elf in incoherent excla|mations.&mdash;Some old &s;oldiers accidentally pa&s;&s;ing thro' the town that morning, on their way from camp to vi&s;it their friends, led by curio&s;ity turned in, to view the &s;ad remains; on &s;ight of the woman and her tender offspring, notwith&s;tanding all their firm|ne&s;s, the tender &s;ympathetic tear &s;tealing gently down their furrowed cheeks, betrayed the angui&s;h of their hearts; on being &s;hewed the body of the &s;acrificer they pau&s;ed a moment, then muttering forth an oath or two of execration, with their eyes fixed on the ground in &s;ilent &s;orrow, they &s;lowly went their way. So awful and terrible a di&s;a&s;ter wrought wonderfully on the minds of the neighbourhood; nature it&s;elf &s;eemed ru&s;tled, and refu&s;ed the kindly aid of balmy &s;leep for a time.</P>
<P>Near the clo&s;e of the day on the 12th of December, the bodies being &s;till unburied, the people, who had collected in great num|bers, grew almo&s;t frantic with rage, and in a manner demanded the body of the murderer; the law being &s;ilent on the &s;ubject, it was difficult to determine where decency required the body &s;hould be placed, many propo&s;ed it &s;hould be in an ignominious manner where four roads met, without any coffin or in&s;ignia of re&s;pect, and perforated by a &s;take. Upon which a que&s;tion
<PB N="35" REF="018009_0032_0FA460FF6E39C168">
aro&s;e, where that place could be found which might be unexcep|tionable to the neighbourhood&mdash;but no one would con&s;ent it &s;hould be near his hou&s;e or land. After &s;ome con&s;ultation it was thought be&s;t to place it on the bank of the river between high and low water mark; the body was handed out of the window and bound with cords on a fled, with the cloaths on as it was found, and the bloody knife tied on his brea&s;t, without coffin or box, and the hor&s;e he u&s;ually rode was made fa&s;t to the &s;led&mdash;the hor&s;e, unaccum&s;tomed to the draught, proceeded with great un&s;teadine&s;s, &s;ometimes running full &s;peed, then &s;top|ping, followed by a multitude, until arriving at the water's edge, the body was tumbled into a hole dug for the purpo&s;e, like the carca&s;e of a bea&s;t. Not many days after there appeared an unea&s;ine&s;s in &s;undry per&s;ons at placing the body &s;o near a ferry much frequented; &s;ome threatnings were given out that the body &s;hould be taken up and a &s;econd time expo&s;ed to view. It was thought prudent it &s;hould be removed, and &s;ecretly depo&s;it|ed in &s;ome ob&s;cure &s;pot, it was accordingly removed with the ut|mo&s;t &s;ecrecy; notwith&s;tanding which &s;ome children acciden|tally di&s;covered the place, and the early fre&s;hes partly wa&s;hed up the body, and it has had a &s;econd remove to a place where it is hoped mankind will have no further vexation with it.</P>
<P>On the 13th of December the bodies of the murdered were in|tered in a manner much unlike that of the unnatural murderer.&mdash;The remains of the children were borne by a &s;uitable num|ber of equal age, attended with a &s;ad proce&s;&s;ion of youths of the town, all bathed in tears; &s;ide by &s;ide the haple&s;s woman's corp&s;e was carried in &s;olemn proce&s;&s;ion to the pari&s;h church yard, fol|lowed by a great concour&s;e, who with affectionate concern and every token of re&s;pect were anxious to expre&s;s their heart-felt &s;orrow in performing the la&s;t mournful duties.</P>
<P>The per&s;on of Mr. Beadle was &s;mall, his features &s;triking and full of expre&s;&s;ion, with the a&s;pect of fiercene&s;s and determina|tion; his mind was contemplative, when once he had formed an opinion, was remarkably tenacious; as a merchant or trader, he was e&s;teemed a man of &s;trict honor and integrity, and would not de&s;cend to any low or mean artifice to advance his fortune. He was turned of 52 years of age when he died.</P>
<P>Mrs. Beadle was born at Plymouth, in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, of re|putable parents&mdash;a comely per&s;on, of good addre&s;s, well bred, unu&s;ually &s;erene, &s;incere, unaffected and &s;en&s;ible; died in the middle of life, aged 32 years.</P>
<P>The children (the elde&s;t of which was a &s;on, aged 12 years, the other three, daughters, the younge&s;t aged 6 years) were &s;uch as cheared the hearts of their parents, who were uncom|monly fond of di&s;playing their little virtues and excellencies,
<PB N="36" REF="018009_0033_0FA46100B109E0F8">
and &s;eemed to anticipate a continuance of growing parental &s;a|tisfaction; alas, like early tender buds nipped by untimely fro&s;ts, they did but begin to live!</P>
<P>It is more than probable, this man had for months pa&s;t de&s;ired that &s;ome or all of his children might be taken out of the world by accident; be removed all means of &s;ecurity from a well near his hou&s;e, which he was careful heretofore to keep covered. His little boy he often &s;ent to &s;wim in the river, and has been heard to chide the child for not venturing further into deep water than his fears would &s;uffer him. He has at times declared it would give him no pain or unea&s;ine&s;s to follow his children to the grave&mdash;his acquaintance knew the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions could not ari&s;e from want of affection or tenderne&s;s for his children, but rather imagined him &s;peaking ra&s;hly in je&s;t. He ever &s;poke lightly of death as a bugbear the world cau&s;le&s;sly feared. It appears from his writings, he at fir&s;t had doubts whether it was ju&s;t and rea&s;onable for him to deprive his wife of life, and offers again&s;t it, only this rea&s;on, that he had no hand in bringing her into exi&s;tence, and con&s;equently had no power over her life.&mdash;She &s;et out about the fir&s;t of November on a journey to Fair|field, which he thought was by direction of Heaven to clear him of his doubts and remove her out of the way, at the time the bu&s;ine&s;s was to be done; and his intention was to have executed his de&s;ign on him&s;elf and children in her ab&s;ence. She proceed|ed no further than New-Haven, and by rea&s;on of &s;ome di&s;ap|pointment, returned ten days earlier than expected; he appeared chagrin'd at her early return, and &s;oon began to invent &s;ome ju&s;tifying rea&s;ons for depriving her of life al&s;o. He finally con|cludes it would be unmerciful to leave her behind to langui&s;h out a life in mi&s;ery and wretchedne&s;s, which mu&s;t be the con&s;e|quence of the &s;urprizing death of the re&s;t of the family, and that &s;ince they had &s;hared the frowns and &s;miles of fortune to|gether, it would be cruelty to her, to be divided from them in death.</P>
<P>'Tis very natural for you to a&s;k, whether it was po&s;&s;ible a man could be tran&s;formed from an affectionate hu&s;band and an in|dulgent parent to a &s;ecret murderer, without &s;ome previous al|teration, which mu&s;t have been noticed by the family or ac|quaintance? Yet this was the ca&s;e in this in&s;tance, there was no vi&s;ible alteration in his conduct. It appears by his writings that he thought he had a right to deprive him&s;elf of life and intended to exerci&s;e that right if ever he &s;hould think him&s;elf unfortu|nate, the exten&s;ion of this right to his children, was very ea&s;y. 'Tis probable, the principle had grown up gradually to the la&s;t &s;tage. Since his death I have &s;een a letter he wrote to a friend as early as 1777, in which he has an expre&s;&s;ion like this&mdash;"I be|lieve
<PB N="37" REF="018009_0034_0FA4610141F66160">
I and my family &s;hall not live to &s;ee the end of the war."&mdash;It was then under&s;tood to mean nothing more than his expecta|tion, the war would continue a long time, his late conduct has explained it very differently&mdash;Whether Mrs. Beadle had any fears of his evil intentions or not, is uncertain, that &s;he had fears &s;ome great calamity would befal the family is evident, both from what &s;he &s;aid, and what he has left in writing.&mdash;He writes on the 18th of November, that on the morning of the 17th &s;he told him, "She dreamed he had wrote many papers, and was earne&s;tly concerned for her, and that tho&s;e papers were &s;potted with blood; and that &s;he al&s;o &s;aw a man wound him&s;elf pa&s;t recovery and blood guggle (as &s;he expre&s;&s;ed it) from different parts of his body."&mdash;In another letter, of a later date, he writes as follows, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> "I mentioned before that my wife had a dream concerning this affair, &s;he has &s;ince had two more, one of them. That &s;he was &s;uddenly &s;eized and liable to great puni&s;hment, that it created great confu&s;ion, but &s;he afterwards got free and was happy; from her excellence of heart, I have no doubt but this will be the ca&s;e with her.&mdash;On the thank&s;giving night &s;he dreamed, that her three daughters all lay dead, and that they even froze in that &s;ituation; and even yet I am little affected".<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Editor is &s;en&s;ible that it may be di&s;gu&s;tful to &s;ome readers to ob&s;erve the&s;e dreams repeated after in&s;erting them in the &s;ermon, but this letter was written before it was known the &s;ermon would be publi&s;hed, and the ob&s;ervations upon the &s;ubject being very different, and &s;ince the &s;en&s;e would not be compleat without a repetition of them he hopes the reader will take no exception thereat.</NOTE></P>
<P>The afternoon before this terrible execution, Mrs. Beadle walked abroad to vi&s;it an acquaintance, and it was ob&s;erved by the lady, &s;he was uncommonly pen&s;ive; &s;he a&s;ked the rea&s;on, Mrs. Beadle with much concern told her, "She had for months been troubled with frightful and uncommon dreams, and that very morning &s;he dreamed violence had been offered her family and her children de&s;troyed; &s;he &s;aid tho&s;e dreams wrought on her mind to a very great degree, to divert her thoughts from them &s;he had walk'd abroad that afternoon; and that &s;he verily believed Providence had judgments in &s;tore for their family, which he was about to inflict on them by &s;ome &s;weeping &s;ick|ne&s;s, or in &s;ome other awful manner."&mdash;Mr. Beadle, who, as appears by his writings, was alone privy to his malevolent inten|tions, put a very different con&s;truction upon her dreams. He doubtle&s;s con&s;idered them as premonitions from Heaven, and convincing proof to him that his purpo&s;e was right, of which he &s;ays he had &s;undry intimations he really thought from God him|&s;elf, which he does not de&s;cribe.</P>
<P>From whence tho&s;e dreams originated it is impo&s;&s;ible to de|termine; whether 'the weapons he carried to his bed &s;ide gave
<PB N="38" REF="018009_0035_0FA46102D2B6F848">
her unea&s;ine&s;s and excited a jealou&s;y in her mind of his intenti|ons, or whether any of his conduct which fell under her ob&s;er|vation might be alarming to her, which might trouble her &s;leep, no one can tell. She has lately mentioned &s;undry dreams of a &s;imilar nature, which &s;he had near &s;ix months &s;ince. Some great and good characters have thought &s;uch intimations were at times given from on high, to convince mankind of the reality of the invi&s;ible world&mdash;to hazard &s;uch a conjecture in the&s;e modern days would perhaps be thought by the learned world a great mark of fanataci&s;m&mdash;every man mu&s;t think for him&s;elf, no one can pro|nounce with &s;atisfactory certainty with re&s;pect to the origin and cau&s;e of &s;uch thoughts in &s;leep, which &s;o nearly corre&s;pond with the true &s;tate of facts. Her la&s;t dream penned by him was near|ly literally verified. Although the weather was &s;erene and plea&s;ant on the 10th, and near full moon: neither the &s;un or moon were vi&s;ible from the time this horrid deed was done, un|til the body of this man was laid beneath the clods, which re|doubled the horror: when &s;uddenly the wind blew from the northwe&s;t, di&s;pelled the vapours and di&s;covered a cloudle&s;s &s;ky. The air grew cold, and the faces of the other five being opened to view in their coffins, in the front of the meeting-hou&s;e, the concour&s;e was &s;o great that much time was &s;pent to give op|portunity for all to take a view; the cold &s;till increa&s;ing, the bo|dies in all probability were &s;tifned with fro&s;t.</P>
<P>Mr. Beadle left &s;undry letters directed to his acquaintance, and one laboured treati&s;e in ju&s;tification of his conduct; they contain many incon&s;i&s;tencies. He profe&s;&s;es him&s;elf a Dei&s;t, but reprobates Athei&s;m. While in life and pro&s;perity he claim'd to be a Chri&s;tian, and offered two of his children in bapti&s;m. Much has been &s;aid in favour of publi&s;hing his writings by tho&s;e who have not &s;een them; tho&s;e who have peru&s;ed them have doubted the propriety of &s;uch a mea&s;ure; not becau&s;e his rea&s;onings again&s;t revelation were in any degree unan&s;werable, but le&s;t they might have &s;ome effect on weak and melancholy minds. He attempts to attack all rulers in Church and State, treats the Chri&s;tian reli|gion with a great degree of bitterne&s;s and bigotry; and yet ab&s;urdly concludes by &s;aying, "if it is true he &s;hall be &s;aved by it."&mdash;He is very un&s;ettled, wavering and incon&s;i&s;tent in his own beloved &s;y&s;tem of Dei&s;m.

The ancients encouraged by numbers and example, did in hours of de&s;pair de&s;troy them&s;elves and families, to avoid the &s;hame of becoming captives to be led in triumph, and the cruelty commonly exerci&s;ed in tho&s;e barbarous ages.</P>
