<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE the publication of the <HI>Elements of Mid|wifery</HI> in 1775, continual reflection, and con|&s;tant practice, have produced many changes in dif|ferent parts of them.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t rude production of an author unu&s;ed to publication, requires frequent revi&s;al and copious alterations; but, in another view, this WORK is materially different. In the earlier &s;tages, the Author imagined, that Midwifery was in a great mea&s;ure Empirical; and that its principles were few, vague, and uncertain. His opinions were not peculiar; and if he erred, he erred with the greate&s;t and mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful practitioners. But he has &s;ince found, that, though in many re&s;pects uncertain, the Theory of Midwifery de&s;erved his attention, as it might of|ten direct the Practice; and that its imperfections were not greater than tho&s;e of the Theory of Me|dicine in general, which have not been thought of &s;ufficient con&s;equence to preclude the attention of phy&s;icians.</P>
<P>With the&s;e views, he has endeavoured to give at lea&s;t the rudiments of a complete &s;y&s;tem; and, as
<PB N="iv" REF="022551_0003_0FB944BD9FA86690">
the Work was therefore materially changed, it was common ju&s;tice to the world and to him&s;elf to give &s;ome information of this change.</P>
<P>But, independent of this principle, the former Title would not NOW have expre&s;&s;ed the pre&s;ent object and de&s;ign; &s;o that a work different in matter ought al&s;o to differ in form.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE following COMPEND of MIDWIFERY was orginally intend for the u&s;e of tho&s;e gentlemen only who favour the author with their attendance on his lectures. But, after having engaged in the work, the importance of the &s;ubject induced him to con|&s;ider it in a more enlarged view.</P>
<P>Although he cannot lay claim to any particular di&s;covery or material improvement in the art, yet he flatters him&s;elf, that the conci&s;e and &s;imple manner in which the following treati&s;e is detailed, will render it not unacceptable to readers of experience. It con|tains &s;ome of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential principles of the ob&s;tetrical art; and, &s;hould it prove an u&s;eful a&s;&s;i&s;tant to inexperienced practitioners, or &s;ugge&s;t hints to others better qualified to improve them, the end of this publication will be fully an&s;wered.</P>
<P>The &s;tudy of MIDWIFERY is an object highly in|tere&s;ting; and has, in all ages, engaged the attenti|on of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed of the medical profe&s;&s;ion. Though &s;till in an imperfect &s;tate, its improvements of late, by the labours of men of genius and lear|ning, have been numerous and important.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="022551_0009_0FB944CD674CAF28">
How few are the modern in&s;truments, in compa|ri&s;on of tho&s;e employed by the ancients! How &s;im|ple is their con&s;truction! And how &s;eldom is recour&s;e had to them! Of late a true &s;pirit of ob&s;ervation has ari&s;en, and been directed to the mo&s;t important ob|jects; every di&s;ea&s;e has been accurately di&s;tingui&s;hed from tho&s;e which it more nearly re&s;embles; and it may with truth be affirmed, that more light has been thrown on his &s;ubject, within the&s;e few years, than for above a century preceding. The late publicati|ons of Dr SMELLIE, Dr MANNING, Dr HULME, Dr LEAK, Mr WHITE, Mr MOSS, Dr DENMAN, Dr OSBURNE, and others, and the elegant plates of Dr Hunter, may be con&s;idered as valuable acqui&s;itions to the practice of midwifery.</P>
<P>With regard to the plan of the following work, the &s;ame method has been ob&s;erved which the author pur&s;ues in his cour&s;e of lectures. As this plan has &s;ome peculiarities, it will perhaps be nece&s;&s;ary to premi&s;e tho&s;e reflections which fir&s;t gave occa&s;ion to it; and as they ari&s;e from the nature of the &s;ubject it&s;elf, they will form no un&s;uitable introduction.</P>
<P>Nothing is more conducive to the proper method of teaching an art, than to con&s;ider its principle ob|ject, as well as its immediate relations to tho&s;e that are mo&s;t intimately connected with it. By this means a di&s;tinction can be made between tho&s;e parts to
<PB N="xi" REF="022551_0010_0FB944CEEBABB3E8">
which attention ought to be chiefly directed, and others which would rather embarra&s;s than a&s;&s;i&s;t our re&s;earches.</P>
<P>If, for in&s;tance, the &s;everal parts of medicine be con&s;idered, their ends will be found to be e&s;&s;entially different; and, of con&s;equence, the means by which the&s;e ends are accompli&s;hed will be frequently oppo&s;ite. This is particularly illu&s;trated by a little reflection on two different branches of the &s;cience, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the practice of phy&s;ic, and of &s;urgery, &s;trictly &s;o called. In the fir&s;t, the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e can only be collected from &s;ymptoms; which, as the &s;ame &s;ymptoms pro|ceed from different and even oppo&s;ite &s;tates of the body, mu&s;t &s;ometimes unavoidably lead into error; and even the &s;ymptoms them&s;elves are often &s;o con|tradictory, that nothing can be collected from them; &s;o that the phy&s;ician is obliged to proceed on &s;ome very vague and di&s;tant analogy. Though the&s;e difficulties be &s;urmounted, the effects of reme|dies are &s;till uncertain? the real effects of many are not known; and, as they operate, not on an inanimate machine, but on a &s;y&s;tem, in which, from any change, motions are excited frequently op|po&s;ite to tho&s;e expected, it is not &s;urpri&s;ing that the expectations of the phy&s;ician are often baffled. Thus the practice of phy&s;ic cannot be regulated by certain rules; it depends much on the &s;tate of the
<PB N="xii" REF="022551_0011_0FB944D066A693B8">
body in health, and the very different changes introdu|ced by di&s;ea&s;e: To &s;tudy it properly, all the&s;e ought to be con&s;idered; and it is this part which is com|monly called the Theory of Medicine.</P>
<P>In a &s;ubject &s;o difficult and ob&s;cure as the ani|mal oeconomy, it is not &s;urpri&s;ing that the practitioner &s;hould be often embarra&s;&s;ed; and that in&s;tead of certainty, he &s;hould &s;ometimes be obliged to de|termine his conduct by probability, or by a loo&s;e and uncertain analogy.</P>
<P>But the views of the &s;urgeon are le&s;s ob&s;cure; he is often confined to ca&s;es where manual dexterity <HI>only</HI> is nece&s;&s;ary, and has, very generally, the objects of con&s;ideration &s;ubjected to his &s;en&s;es; and, where they are out of the reach of &s;en&s;e, the &s;ymptoms are more plain, the inductions fewer, and the conclu&s;ions more certain. In this part, then, theory is le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary, and only u&s;eful as it &s;eems to connect the &s;everal facts: Practice is particularly proper to ac|quire that firmne&s;s and con&s;tancy of mind, and that manual dexterity, &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the &s;ucce&s;s and cha|racter of a &s;urgeon.</P>
<P>Midwifery, which may be defined <Q>The art of fa|cilitating the birth of children,</Q> is to be con&s;idered in much the &s;ame light as the other parts of &s;urgery. Theory is le&s;s e&s;&s;ential to it, as it chiefly con&s;i&s;ts in an operation which requires a dexterity, only to be
<PB N="xiii" REF="022551_0012_0FB944D21B5792A0">
learned by practice. But, taken in a more enlarged &s;en&s;e, Midwifery may be defined, <Q>The art of facilitating the birth of children, and of managing pregnant and puerperal women.</Q> A part of it, therefore, has &s;till a relation to the practice of phy&s;ic; and, as &s;uch, mu&s;t be involved in the &s;ame difficulties and ob&s;curities.</P>
<P>In this view, then, two objects are chiefly to be attended to:
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. The operation it&s;elf, with every thing relative to it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. The &s;tate of the woman after delivery.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>To obtain a proper knowledge of the fir&s;t of the&s;e, it is nece&s;&s;ary that the &s;tructure and functions of the parts them&s;elves, the &s;everal changes which they un|dergo, and the cau&s;es which may prevent or retard either conception, or a proper delivery, &s;hould be known. The two fir&s;t of the&s;e comprehend the Phy|&s;iology of Midwifery; the la&s;t, what may be called the Pathology.</P>
<P>An attention to the &s;tructure of a machine on which we operate, is certainly a point of the greate&s;t con|&s;equence; and it is particularly &s;o in the ob&s;tetrical art, as much of the practice depends on a proper knowledge of the parts: And it is not only the ana|tomical con&s;ideration of every part, but the relations of one part to another, their di&s;tances and their incli|nations,
<PB N="xiv" REF="022551_0013_0FB944D36979DBE0">
both with re&s;pect to each other, and to other parts of the body, that are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to be attended to. The con&s;ideration of their &s;everal func|tions is not &s;o e&s;&s;ential, as it contains only hypothe&s;es, which, though &s;anctified by the authority of great names, are often trifling, generally in&s;ufficient and un&s;atisfactory. The&s;e, however, as they are imme|diately connected with the &s;ubject, have not been o|mitted. Several opinions with regard to the Theo|ries of Generation and Conception, have been con|ci&s;ely mentioned. This may be called the Phy&s;iology of Midwifery; for if no di&s;ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e comes on, a natural delivery at full time may rea&s;onably be expected. But there are many Topical Affections of the parts in the impregnated &s;tate, which will influence deli|very, either by inducing it prematurely, or preventing it altogether. Many di&s;ea&s;es may al&s;o &s;upervene in the impregnated &s;tate, which will have the &s;ame effect; tho&s;e, therefore, mu&s;t be con&s;idered, and the mo&s;t approved method of relieving them pointed out. Having thus laid a proper foundation, the Operation it&s;elf, with all its material variations, comes next to be explained. This fini&s;hes the fir&s;t, and not the lea&s;t important part of MIDWIFERY, and concludes the pre&s;ent work.</P>
<P>The &s;econd part, or the management of lying-in women, and al&s;o of new born children, &s;hould fall next to be con&s;idered.</P>
<P><PB N="xv" REF="022551_0014_0FB944D4E058F1E0">
The management of puerperal women, from the late labours of &s;ome ingenious accoucheurs already re|ferred to, may now be conducted on a more certain footing; the different di&s;ea&s;es, for in&s;tance, may be di&s;tingui&s;hed with greater accuracy, which is a chief point in conducting the cure. The management, where there is no particular di&s;ea&s;e, is now directed by an attention to nature, unencumbered by refine|ments built on fallacious and uncertain theory. This part the author propo&s;ed for the &s;ubject of a &s;econd volume; but the late publications, already menti|oned, have in &s;ome mea&s;ure anticipitated the inten|tion.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of the PELVIS.</HEAD>
<P>THE human &s;keleton is divided into the Head, Trunk, and extremities. The Head includes the Cranium and Face. The Trunk con&s;i&s;ts of the Spine, Thorax, and Bones of the Pelvis. The latter, which include al&s;o part of the Spine, are the more immediate objects of the Accoucheur's atten|tion.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pelvis</HI> is an irregular cavity, more nearly ap|proaching to a cylindrical than any other figure; and is chiefly compo&s;ed of the <HI>O&s;&s;a Innominata,</HI> the
<PB N="26" REF="022551_0016_0FB944D99E452540">
<HI>Os Sacrum,</HI> and <HI>O&s;&s;a Coccygis.</HI> The two o&s;&s;a inno|minata con&s;titute the lateral and anterior parts; the os &s;acrum, and &s;mall range of bones called the <HI>coccyx,</HI> form the po&s;terior part. This bony circumference includes a &s;pace which repre&s;ents the figure of a ba|&s;on, from whence the name PELVIS is derived.</P>
<P>To have an accurate knowledge of the Pelvis, it is nece&s;&s;ary, fir&s;t, to de&s;cribe &s;eparately the different parts of which it con&s;i&s;ts, and then to con&s;ider it when the&s;e parts are united.</P>
<DIV4 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION I. Of the Parts of the Pelvis &s;eparately.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>O&s;&s;a innominata</HI> are two large expanded bones, which form the &s;ides and fore-parts of the pelvis, and inferior lateral parts of the abdo|men. In infancy and childhood, each of the&s;e bones is divided into three di&s;tinct parts by interme|diate cartilages; and tho' afterwards the bones be|come united, and every appearance of former &s;epa|ration is nearly obliterated, the names by which they were di&s;tingui&s;hed in younger years are &s;till re|tained.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Os Ilium,</HI> or Haunch-bone, is the &s;uperi|or and large&s;t portion of the innominatum. It ex|tends from the &s;emicircular ridge at the &s;uperior,
<PB N="27" REF="022551_0017_0FB944DDE0EFC728">
part, downwards and backwards as a tran&s;ver&s;e &s;ecti|on of two-fifths of the <HI>acetabulum</HI> or cavity which re|ceives the round head of the thigh-bone, and for|wards to a little below the projection or ridge which forms the brim of the pelvis. Hence a &s;mall por|tion of the <HI>ilium,</HI> only, belongs to the pelvis, the expanded part being placed entirely without the brim. The different parts of the <HI>ilium</HI> are, the &s;uperior &s;e|micircular ridge or &s;pine, giving ri&s;e to &s;everal ine|qualities or prominences, termed <HI>&s;pinal proce&s;&s;es;</HI> two broad &s;urfaces, improperly named <HI>dor&s;um</HI> and <HI>co&s;ta;</HI> the &s;mall irregular &s;urface by which it is joined to the &s;acrum po&s;teriorly; the lower, thick, narrow part of the acetabulum; and, the ridge or projection at the inferior anterior part.</P>

<P>The po&s;terior part of the pelvis is made up of the <HI>Os Sacrum,</HI> or Rump-bone, and its extremity the <HI>Coccyx.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Os &s;acrum</HI> called al&s;o <HI>Os Basilare</HI> by the anci|ent, from its u&s;e in &s;upporting the trunk, is, in young &s;ubjects, compo&s;ed of five or &s;ix peices, with intermediate cartilages. It has two &s;urfaces, an ex|ternal and internal: the former is rough and convex; the latter more &s;mooth and concave, marked with &s;e|veral tran&s;ver&s;e lines, the remains of the intermedi|ate cartilages which formerly connected the &s;everal pieces of bone. The flat &s;ide is bent, fir&s;t downwards and a little backwards, then con&s;iderably forwards. The <HI>&s;acrum</HI> is of a &s;pongy cellular texture; and, in proportion to its &s;ize, the lighte&s;t bone of the body. Its figure is triangular, having the &s;uperior part for the ba&s;e, with the apex dwonwards, gradually becom|ing narrower terminates in its appendage the <HI>Coccyx.</HI> The &s;uperior part, or ba&s;e, anteriorly, has a &s;harp ridge, which makes the po&s;terior part of the brim of the pelvis. Through the holes by which this bone is perforated, many nerves are tran&s;mitted. Tho&s;e

The <HI>&s;acrum</HI> is articulated above to the la&s;t vertebra of the loins, in the &s;ame manner with the true vertebrae. Laterally, it is join|ed to the o&s;&s;a innominata by a deep irregular &s;urface, where it forms the &s;acroiliac &s;ymphy&s;is, which makes an immoveable &s;ynchondro&s;is; and below, it is con|nected with the coccyx by means of &s;trong ligaments. It is &s;ecurely guarded from external injuries, by the thick mu&s;cles that cover it behind, and by the &s;trong ligamentous membranes which clo&s;ely adhere to it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Os Coccygis,</HI> which is placed at the extremity of the <HI>&s;acrum,</HI> forms the lower po&s;terior part of the pelvis, and inferior terminting point of the &s;pine. Its figure re&s;embles an inverted pyramid. Like the &s;acrum, it is bent downwards and forwards; having an external convex, and internal concave, &s;urface. It con&s;i&s;ts, generally, of four pieces of bones, with intermediate cartilages which admit of con&s;iderable motion of the bones, in a direction mo&s;t commodi|ou&s;ly adapted for the enlargment of the inferior ca|pacity of the pelvis.</P>
<P>In children, the <HI>coccyx</HI> is almo&s;t wholly cartilage; towards the decline of life, the interpo&s;ed cartilages begin to o&s;&s;ify: and at length the &s;eparate pieces are united, and become one bone with the &s;acrum. The immobility of the <HI>coccyx</HI> is not, however, the only rea&s;on why women advanced in life have commonly difficult and laborious births: various rea&s;ons al&s;o con|cur,

<P>The pelvis is articulated with the &s;pine at the &s;upe|rior po&s;terior part, and with the o&s;&s;a femorum below. Its principal u&s;es are, to defend tho&s;e parts contain|ed in it from external injury, to &s;upport the uterus during ge&s;tation, and to give pa&s;&s;age to the child at birth. It al&s;o &s;upports the trunk and inferior parts of the body, forming the intermediate connection bet|ween them; and is the great centre of motion of the whole machine.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION II. Of the Shape and Dimen&s;ions of the Pelvis.</HEAD>
<P>THE cavity of the pelvis, or &s;pace included with|in the bones, is of different &s;hapes in different &s;ubjects; and has been &s;uppo&s;ed by different authors to approach more or le&s;s to an oval, elliptic, trian|gular, or circular form. Its circumference ought to be &s;omewhat between an oval and a circle, and to mea&s;ure nearly one-fourth of the height of the body.</P>
<P>The le&s;&s;er or true pelvis may be di&s;tingui&s;hed by the <HI>brim,</HI> or &s;uperior aperture; and the <HI>bottom,</HI> outlet, or inferior aperture. Con&s;idered in this point of view, the diameters of its brim and bottom, the width, depth, and form of its cavity, mu&s;t be carefully at|tended to.</P>
<P>At the brim, the large&s;t diameter of the pelvis is lateral, the next to it diagonal, and the &s;malle&s;t from pubes to &s;acrum. A well-formed pelvis ought to mea&s;ure nearly five inches and one-fourth laterally; four inches and one-half, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">four and three-fourths, diagonally; and four inches and one-fourth from the top of the pubes to that of the &s;acrum. The&s;e pro|portions are rever&s;ed at its inferior aperture, where the pelvis is nearly an inch wider from the lower part of the arch of the pubes to the point of the coccyx, when
<PB N="33" REF="022551_0023_0FB944EC211CFD60">
that bone is on the &s;tretch, than it is from &s;ide to &s;ide: For the di&s;tance between the tubero&s;ities of the i&s;chia is about four inches, or four and one-fourth only; and from the arch of the pubes to the extremity of the coccyx when &s;tretched out, five inches, or five and one-fourth.</P>
<P>The pelvis at the &s;ides is nearly twice as deep as at the fore-part, and almo&s;t three times deeper be|hind; <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> from the top of the &s;acrum to the point of the coccyx, when extended, &s;ix inches, four at the &s;ides, and two only at the pubes. The upper and lateral parts of the pelvis, at the brim, are nearly perpendicular: but the anterior part is &s;hallow; and the lateral openings in the recent &s;ubject are covered with membranous, mu&s;cular, and ligamentous parts, which yield with the coccyx to the pre&s;&s;ure of the child's head, and form a concave nearly equal to that of the &s;acrum.&mdash;From this con&s;truction, added to the curve and concavity of the &s;acrum, and mobility of the coccyx, the bottom is con&s;iderably more capacious, and &s;omewhat more circular than the brim.</P>
<P>A line from the &s;ymphy&s;is of the pubes, to the junction of the two la&s;t vertebrae of the &s;acrum, is horizontal. And a line that bi&s;ects this horizontal line, as well as the two diameters of the brim, makes the axis of the pelvis; and, if produced, will pa&s;s through the umbilicus in an erect po&s;ture; but, if in a reclining po&s;ture, the line that pa&s;&s;es through the umbilicus will be at right angles to the diameter of
<PB N="34" REF="022551_0024_0FB944EDB08DB7D0">
the brim: and, in general, whatever is &s;aid of the angle which the axis makes with the diameter, is to be under&s;tood of the diameter of the brim, when the woman is erect; and of the horizontal line when re|clined. But, towards the end of pregnancy, a line to pa&s;s through the centre of the pelvis mu&s;t fall half|way between the navel and &s;crobiculus cordis.</P>
<P>The axes of the different parts of the pelvis, form|ed by a diagonal, &s;how the curved line of direc|tion which the child's head de&s;cribes in pa&s;&s;ing; and if the&s;e axes are &s;uppo&s;ed to be prolonged, they give the <HI>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">placement</HI> of the child's body.</P>
<P>THE female pelvis differs from the male chiefly in the following particulars: The angle which the vertebrae lumborum make with the &s;acrum is more obtu&s;e, the ilia are more expanded, the concavity of the &s;acrum and coccyx is larger, the connection of the coccyx with the &s;acrum is loo&s;er, the tubero&s;ities of the i&s;chia are placed at a greater di&s;tance, the &s;ym|phy&s;is of the pubes is thicker, the arch of the pubes and the lateral openings are more con&s;iderable, and the pelvis is wider in all its dimen&s;ions.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION III. Di&s;torted pelvis.</HEAD>
<P>THE figure and proportions of the pelvis vary in &s;ome degree in different women; for the depth and form may be &s;o affected by different degrees of di&s;tortion, as not only greatly to dimini&s;h its cavity, and occa&s;ion le&s;s or more difficulty and danger in de|livery, but in &s;ome in&s;tances to &s;uch a degree as to render the birth of a living child altogether im|po&s;&s;ible. As the proportions above de&s;cribed con|&s;titute what is called a <HI>&s;tandard pelvis,</HI> if it come &s;hort of the&s;e dimen&s;ions, the pelvis becomes faulty or di&s;ea&s;ed.</P>
<P>There are different kinds, as well as degrees, of narrow pelves. Sometimes the cavity of the pelvis is con&s;titutionally &s;mall, without any deformity. Sometimes there is a narrowne&s;s confined to the brim; &s;ometimes to the inferior aperture. Sometimes the di&s;tortion is general over all the pelvis: And &s;ome|times the capacity is retrenched by an intru&s;ion of the vertebrae lumborum over the &s;acrum; which may be &s;o con&s;iderable, as to reduce the diameter of the brim to the &s;pace only of two or three inches, or even le&s;s: and this is the &s;pecies of di&s;tortion mo&s;t fre|quently ob&s;erved in practice. The vertebrae of the &s;acrum may be al&s;o, from pre&s;&s;ure while in a morbid

&s;tate, &s;o deformed and protruded, as to render that bone quite &s;traight, and from the &s;ame cau&s;e often convex in&s;tead of concave.</P>
<P>The cau&s;es of narrow pelvi&s;es are chiefly ricketty affections in infancy, al&s;o external violence; &s;uch as fractures and di&s;location of the bones, &amp;c. The bones al&s;o become &s;oftened by di&s;ea&s;e in the adult &s;tate; and are then liable to narrowne&s;s and di&s;tor|tion, even in women who have formerly had ea&s;y labours<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> Vol. V of the London Medical Ob&s;ervations and In|quiries, ca&s;e of Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">. Op. by Dr Cooper.</NOTE>; but &s;uch ca&s;es are rare. If the pelvis &s;hould not mea&s;ure above two inches and a half from pubes to &s;acrum, and not above three laterally, it would be impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ave the child at full growth, in any other manner than by enlarging the capacity of the pelvis by an inci&s;ion of the &s;ymphy&s;is pubes.</P>
<P>It is often extremely difficult to di&s;cover a narrow pelvis, e&s;pecially if the narrowne&s;s be confined to the brim. We may &s;u&s;pect the di&s;tortion, from the make and &s;hape of the woman. The direction in which the &s;pine is di&s;torted frequently determines it. But the pelvis is not always affected by a morbid cur|vature of the &s;pine: if that extend, however, to the lumber vertebrae, the pelvis very &s;eldom e&s;capes: though the mo&s;t certain and infallible diagno&s;tic is the di&s;tortion of the inferior extremities along with a twi&s;ted &s;pine. Women who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> well proportioned in
<PB N="37" REF="022551_0027_0FB944F41A6A5828">
the lower extremities, have generally good pelvi&s;es. When the&s;e are ill proportioned or crooked, e&s;pe|cially the thigh bones, along with other &s;u&s;picious appearances, the pelvis is very generally, though not univer&s;ally, deformed.</P>
<P>We can generally, by the touch, di&s;cover any &s;pecies of di&s;tortion in the pelvis, below the brim, from the tubero&s;ities of the i&s;chia approaching too near each other, from the convexity of the &s;acrum, from the difference of &s;hape in the arch of the pubes, &amp;c;.</P>
<P>When the deformity is at, or above, the brim, and the woman otherwi&s;e well &s;haped, it is often impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;certain the narrowne&s;s till the labour be con&s;iderably advanced, and the child's head pre|&s;enting in a conical from, with the bones protruding over one another, which are pretty certain marks of a narrow pelvis, or of a very large head.</P>
<P>But in order to under&s;tand the dimen&s;ions of the pelvis, it will be proper to con&s;ider the &s;tructure and form of the head of the foetus; which, being com|pounded of different pieces, is admirably well adapted for accommodating it&s;elf to the figure and diameters of the pelvis.</P>
<P>The figure of the head is &s;pheroidal, being com|po&s;ed of two ovals a little depre&s;&s;ed on each <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ther; one of which is &s;uperior, called the <HI>cranium,</HI> th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> bones of which are &s;mooth and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, with intervening

&s;paces, called <HI>&s;utures,</HI> that on pre&s;&s;ure allow the bones to yield and &s;lide on each other; whereas the bones of the face, which make the anterior oval, are more &s;olid, rough, and uneven, and mu&s;t therefore give con&s;iderable re&s;i&s;tance in Pa&s;&s;ing through the pelvis.</P>
<P>Eight bones compo&s;e the <HI>Cranium,</HI> &s;ix of which are proper, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the <HI>Os Frontis</HI> and <HI>Occiput,</HI> two <HI>O&s;&s;a Parietalia,</HI> two <HI>O&s;&s;a Temporum,</HI> and two com|mon to <HI>Cranium</HI> and face, the <HI>Ethmoid</HI> and <HI>Sphenoid.</HI> The bones are connected to each other by the <HI>coronal lambdoidal, &s;agittal,</HI> and <HI>&s;quamous</HI> &s;utures.</P>
<P>The head is broader behind than before, and the face is broader above than below.</P>
<P>On the upper part of the cranium, where the &s;agittal and coronal &s;utures cro&s;s each other, is a membranous &s;pace called the <HI>fontanella</HI> or <HI>open of the head.</HI></P>
<P>The point from which the hair diverges is called the <HI>vertex.</HI></P>
<P>The head, like the pelvis, has different diameters. The ordinary dimen&s;ions at birth are as follows:</P>
<P>From the os frontis to the occiput, between 4 and 4&frac12; inches; or, according to Dr Burton, 4 3/10 inches.</P>
<P>Laterally, from temple to temple, 3 inches.</P>
<P>Laterally, at the po&s;terior part, 3&frac12; inches.</P>
<P>From the top of the heat to the nape of the, neck, 3 6/10 inches<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dr Burton's N. S of Midwifery, table 1. fig. 3. and 4.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="022551_0029_0FB944FAF6DD8070">
The length of the face from the chin to the fore|head, is about 5&frac14; inches.</P>
<P>The length of the whole head from chin to vertex, about 5&frac12; inches; and when the vertex is &s;tretched out in laborious births, about 6 or 7 inches.</P>
<P>The total circumference of the head, between 12 and 14 inches, or &s;omewhat more.</P>
<P>The breadth of the body at the &s;houlders, is about 5 or 6 inches.</P>
<P>The breadth of the body at the breech, about 5 inches.</P>
<P>The circumference of the body at &s;houlders and breech, from 15 to 18 inches.</P>
<P>The length of the whole body, 20 or 21 inches.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering the &s;tructure, form, and diameters of the pelvis and child's head, the application, in regard to the mechanical de&s;cent of the head through the pelvis, is &s;ufficiently obvious; but, as the bulk and diameter of the one is not always mathematically adapted to the capacity of the other, difficulties mu&s;t &s;ometimes ari&s;e. Hence the advantage of this pe|culiar &s;tructure and mechani&s;m of the <HI>cranium:</HI> for if the child's head were one firm o&s;&s;ified body, who&s;e dimen&s;ions at any time exceeded tho&s;e of the cylin|drical cavity through which it &s;hould pa&s;s, however mechanically and with whatever force it de&s;cended, the delivery could not be accompli&s;hed without ex|traordinary

a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and the con&s;equences would always prove fatal either to mother or child.</P>
<P>The &s;houlders are al&s;o capable of con&s;iderable diminution by pre&s;&s;ure; and the &s;eparation of the o&s;&s;a innominata in the foetus may contribute, &s;ome|what, to facilitate the pa&s;&s;age in birth.

<P N="1">1. THOUGH the cartilaginous &s;ymphy&s;es at the anterior and po&s;terior parts may be, in &s;ome degree, relaxed in time of labour, it appears &s;uffici|ently obvious, from a &s;uperficial view of the &s;tructure and articulation, that the bones are incapable of &s;e|paration &s;ufficient to enlarge, in any &s;en&s;ible extent, the capacity of the pelvis, but in con&s;equence of di&s;|ea&s;e, or from violence. In that &s;tate the bones may be forced by the throes of labour; but the woman becomes lame, and generally continues &s;o for life.</P>
<P N="2">2. Such a &s;eparation may, however, be procured by inci&s;ion at the &s;ymphy&s;is pubis, in general, though not always with &s;afety to the mother; and a child, which would otherwi&s;e infallibly be de&s;troyed; may
<PB N="41" REF="022551_0031_0FB94502A249CD30">
by that means be extracted alive. The &s;ucce&s;s of this operation, &s;ince fir&s;t performed by Mons. Sigault, is not yet &s;ufficiently e&s;tabli&s;hed to enable us to &s;peak of it in a deci&s;ive manner, nor to point out the parti|cular circum&s;tances in which it may be attempted with propriety. But we may here ob&s;erve, that it cannot, in ca&s;es of difficulty and danger, be perfor|med with an ab&s;olute certainty of pre&s;erving either the mother or child, from the difficulty of a&s;certain|ing the real dimen&s;ions of the pelvis, and of the in|crea&s;ed &s;pace to be gained by the operation.</P>
<P N="3">3. The &s;hape and con&s;truction of the child's head, which admits of con&s;iderable diminution by pre&s;&s;ure, &s;ufficiently compen&s;ate for the want of motion of the bones of the pelvis: for the head is of an oval or &s;pheroidal figure, and the membranous &s;utures permit a free play of the cranial bones by the force of labour. But in different &s;ubjects it varies in &s;hape, &s;tructure, and &s;olidity. Hence, in pa&s;&s;ing through the capacity of the pelvis, it will not always be com|modiou&s;ly modelled to &s;uffer that diminution of its bulk, from pre&s;&s;ure, which may be nece&s;&s;ary. If, therefore, the volume of the child's head be di&s;pro|portioned to the diameters of the brim or outlet of the pelvis, or if the long axis of the one be applied in an improper direction to the other difficulties will occur that will require extraordinary a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P N="4">4. It is therefore of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to know the figure, &s;tructure, mode of po&s;ition of the
<PB N="42" REF="022551_0032_0FB945054C1DF590">

<P N="5">5. The&s;e proportions are, however, liable to con&s;iderable variation in different &s;ubjects; and the whole pelvis may become &s;o affected, as to have its brim, depth and inferior aperture, con&s;iderably re|trenched and dimini&s;hed, either from an original mal-conformation, from brui&s;es, po&s;tures, &amp;c. or from di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P N="6">6. Tho&s;e women who appear, from &s;ome di|&s;tortions, to have been &s;ubject to rickets, have pro|bably a contracted pelvis; and the probability is great|ly &s;trengthened if the lower extremities have &s;uf|fered.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. FEMALE PARTS of GENERATION.</HEAD>
<P>THE organs of generation, &s;o called from their u&s;e in propagating and increa&s;ing the &s;pecies, are divided into <HI>external</HI> and <HI>internal.</HI></P>
<P>The external parts are, the <HI>mons veneris,</HI> the <HI>labia externa,</HI> the <HI>labia interna alae minores</HI> or <HI>nymphae,</HI> the <HI>clitoris</HI> with its glans and praeputium, the orifice of the <HI>urethra,</HI> the <HI>os externum,</HI> membranous expan&s;ion cal|led <HI>hymen, carunculae myrtiformes, &s;phincter vaginae,</HI> and glands of the parts.</P>
<P>The internal parts are, the <HI>vagina,;</HI> the <HI>uterus,</HI> with the ligaments, <HI>ovaria,</HI> and Fallopian tubes; and the blood-ve&s;&s;els and nerves of the parts.</P>
<P>The contiguous parts are, externally, the <HI>anus, &s;phincter ani,</HI> and <HI>perinaeum;</HI> internally, the bladder, <HI>urethra</HI> and <HI>rectum.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>mons veneris</HI> is nothing more than the &s;kin rai&s;ed by a quantity of adipo&s;e &s;ub&s;tance collected under it, that cu&s;hions it up externally in the form of a tumor. From the lower part of which the great <HI>labia</HI> begin, and run downwards, till they are boun|ded by the perinaeum, or by what the French call <HI>fourchette.</HI> In their &s;tructure they are cellular, but more ligamentous than the mons veneris. Their inner &s;urface is villous and glandular, &s;eparating a
<PB N="44" REF="022551_0034_0FB94507E94458A8">
&s;ebacious kind of liquor analogous to that about the corona glandis of the male.</P>
<P>Upon &s;eparating the labia externa, a red projecting body appears, called <HI>clitoris,</HI> compo&s;ed of two crura, which ari&s;e from the lower part of the o&s;&s;a pubis, approach one another, and form the body of the cli|toris, who&s;e extremity is its <HI>glans,</HI> covered with a loo&s;e doubling of the &s;kin, called <HI>praeputium.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>nymphae</HI> are placed immediately within the external labia, and are continued downwards and forwards on the anterior &s;ymphy&s;is pubis nearly as far as the orifice of the urethra. They are pro|ductions or folds of the integuments re&s;embling fraena, and very va&s;cular. When the labia externa are open, they will devaricate; and when &s;hut, come into contact.</P>
<P>Downwards from between the nymphae runs a &s;mooth <HI>fo&s;&s;a;</HI> at the bottom of which is a promin|ence, in the centre of which is the <HI>orifice</HI> of the <HI>ure|thra.</HI> Its u&s;ual &s;ituation is nearly oppo&s;ite to the inferior extermities of the nymphae.</P>
<P>Below the urethra is the aperture into the vagina, called <HI>os externum;</HI> which has round its orifice the <HI>carunculae myrtiformes,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed to be the remains of the ruptured hymen (a membrane peculiar <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> infancy, that &s;urrounds the entry of the vagina in form of a cre&s;cent): but many anatomi&s;ts deny that the&s;e car|unculae are formed from the lacerated hymen, and maintain that they exi&s;t previous to its rupture.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="022551_0035_0FB9450969B5DB40">
The <HI>&s;phincter vaginae</HI> is a flat mu&s;cle, coming out in&s;en&s;ibly from the perinaeum, and is lo&s;t chiefly in the crura clitoridis. In very mu&s;cular &s;ubjects, its fibres run quite round the vagina. There is a plexus of nerves and blood-ve&s;&s;els, called <HI>plexus reteformis,</HI> that goes up on the in&s;ide of this mu&s;cle, and com|municates with the clitoris; which, of con&s;equence, will be compre&s;&s;ed between it and the penis in coition.</P>
<P>The <HI>glands</HI> of the&s;e parts are &s;ituated in &s;uch a manner, that, upon pre&s;&s;ure, a con&s;iderable quantity of vi&s;cus humour is thrown out in time of coition; &s;o that by many this liquor was thought to be the <HI>&s;emen faemineum.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;tructure of the&s;e parts renders them all cal|culated for nearly the &s;ame purpo&s;e, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> to give titillation <HI>in coitu.</HI> The clitoris is &s;ituated in the part where it is mo&s;t expo&s;ed to friction by the introduced penis: its u&s;e, therefore, chiefly, is to render the &s;en&s;ation <HI>in coitu</HI> more exqui&s;ite. The&s;e parts, in proportion to their &s;en&s;ibility, are exceedingly irri|table, and &s;ubject to con&s;iderable inflammation and tumefaction even in the ea&s;ie&s;t labours. Hence the impropriety and hazard of <HI>officious touching</HI> in the beginning of labours, while the pre&s;enting part of the child is at a di&s;tance, while the pa&s;&s;age is narrow and tight, and not yet &s;ufficiently relaxed by the lubri|cating mucus which is afterwards &s;o plentifully
<PB N="46" REF="022551_0036_0FB9450AF1F959A8">
thrown out for the purpo&s;e. The orifices of the&s;e parts, ob&s;erving the direction of the &s;acrum and peri|naeum, do not run &s;traight out, but downwards and forwards; by which the vagina, uterus, and rectum, are in le&s;s danger of protru&s;ion. In the in|troduction of the catheter, the point &s;hould there|fore be directed, fir&s;t a little downwards and back|wards, then gently rai&s;ed forwards and upwards rather than quite &s;traight.</P>
<P>The <HI>vagina,</HI> or pa&s;&s;age to the womb, lies immedi|ately under the bladder, and upon the rectum. It is commonly in length about four or five inches: but this differs in different &s;ubjects, and at different ages: as al&s;o its diameter, which is narrow and contracted in young women, but capable of very con&s;iderable dilation; for in virgins it is full of rugae, but &s;mooth|er in married women and tho&s;e who who have born children. It is compo&s;ed of a plexus of mu&s;cular fi|bres, and a rugous membrane; and its &s;tructure is al|&s;o nervous and glandular. Its internal coat is conti|nued upwards, and makes the inner covering of the uterus.</P>
<P>The vagina and body of the uterus are connected with the bladder, a good deal higher up than with the rectum.</P>
<P>The vagina leads to the os uteri, which projects a a little into that cavity, and advances rather more for ward in the lower po&s;terior that in the upper anterior part.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="022551_0037_0FB9450C6EE5AD20">
The <HI>uterus</HI> lies in the middle of the pelvis, loo&s;ely between the rectum and bladder; but its po&s;ition is liable to variation at different periods of life, and is affected by various other circum&s;tances. It is tri|angular, of the figure of a pear or &s;mall powder-fla&s;k, and generally about three inches long, &s;omewhat con|vex on its &s;uperior part and, by pre&s;&s;ure, a little flattened below.</P>
<P>It is divided into its cervix or collum, and fundus. On being cut open, it appears of a compact &s;olid &s;ub|&s;tance, broader at its upper part, and narrower at the neck: its cavity is very incon&s;iderable in the unim|pregnated &s;tate, for the &s;ides of the plane almo&s;t come in contact. Though its &s;tructure is mu&s;cular, its mu&s;cular fibres can with difficulty be traced: They appear to be mo&s;tly circular; but are very difficult to unravel. Its ve&s;&s;els proceed from the &s;permatics aud hypoga&s;trics. The arteries are very &s;mall in proportion to the veins; which, in time of the ge&s;ta|tion, are &s;o much dilated, as to have obtained the name of <HI>&s;inu&s;es.</HI> Its nerves come from very &s;mall fi|laments: and are chiefly furni&s;hed from the interco&s;t|als, tho&s;e of the &s;acrum, and the &s;ympathetici maxi|mi. It is al&s;o &s;upplied with lymphatic ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>The uterine <HI>ligaments</HI> are of two kinds; the <HI>ligamen|ta lata</HI> and the <HI>ligamenta rotunda.</HI> The former are no more than part of the peritonaeum, which, after gi|ving a coat to the uterus, goes out laterally to form the&s;e ligaments and are therefore only doublings of
<PB N="48" REF="022551_0038_0FB9450F74CF7860">
that membrane, like the me&s;entery to the inte&s;tine. Through the&s;e doublings the ve&s;&s;els of the uterus run. they have two folds in their upper part: The ante|rior contains the Fallopian tubes; the po&s;terior, the ovaria.</P>
<P>Each of the ligamenta rotunda is a little plexus of of mu&s;cular fibres, nerves, and ve&s;&s;els, enveloped in a common membrane, in the form of a cord or liga|ment, coming down before the Fallopian tubes, and going out at the rings of the abdominal mu&s;cles to be lo&s;t in the groin.</P>
<P>In the anterior plica of the broad ligaments the <HI>Tubae F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">llopianae</HI> are contained. They have one extre|mity fixed to the fundus uteri, where the perforation is &s;o &s;mall it will hardly admit of a hog's bri&s;tle; but the diameter gradually enlarges, becoming wider and wider like a trumpet, till it terminates in a loo&s;e floating extremity called <HI>Mor&s;us Diaboli.</HI> This cavi|ty is not &s;traight, but convoluted: When inflated, it &s;eems to be &s;trung upon the broad ligament, as the the inte&s;tines are upon the me&s;entery.</P>
<P>The <HI>ovaria</HI> are two flattened oblong bodies, not very unlike the male te&s;tes, &s;ituated at the &s;ides of the uterus, on the po&s;terior part of the ligamenta lata. Their &s;hape and &s;ize are different in different women: Their outer &s;urface is divided by a number of chops but is &s;moother and more uniform in virgins than in married women who have had children. There is lit|tle to be ob&s;erved in their texture, except a number
<PB N="49" REF="022551_0039_0FB94510E58CD2D0">
of ve&s;&s;els, and &s;omething like ve&s;iculae or water-bags; the&s;e were &s;uppo&s;ed to be the ova, remarkable in the ovaria of quadrupeds. When a woman dies with child, one particular cavity is ob&s;erved, which was thought to be the calyx from whence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> had dropped, and is called <HI>corpus luteum:</HI> but later phy&s;io|logi&s;ts think that the&s;e corpora lutea are glands, con|taining the female &s;emen, which in the time of co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|tion bur&s;t and throw out their contents into the tube in form of a liquid; which, when mixed or blended with the &s;eminal fluid of the male, is &s;uppo&s;ed to be conveyed through the tube into the uterus, to be|come the rudiments of the future foetus. Mo&s;t of the phenomena of impregnation corre&s;pond with this theory. Foetu&s;es have been found in the cavity of the abdomen, where there has been no rupture of the uterus; and bones have made their way through the belly, while the uterus has been found perfectly &s;ound.</P>
<P>Contiguous to the genital parts are, externally, the <HI>anus</HI> and <HI>perinaeum;</HI> internally, the <HI>rectum, urethra,</HI> and <HI>bladder</HI> of urine.</P>
<P>The <HI>anus</HI> is the orifice of the rectum, which is the centre of axis of the pelvis. It is contracted into ru|gae by a plexus of mu&s;cular fibres called <HI>&s;phincter ani,</HI> which an&s;wers nearly the &s;ame purpo&s;e as it does in the male, and is lo&s;t in the perinaeum, in&s;tead of the bulb of the urethra.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="022551_0040_0FB945126A16EAE8">
The <HI>rectum</HI> runs in a line, not quite &s;traight, be|hind the vagina and uterus, in the hollow part of the &s;acrum, through the capacity of the pelvis, and is &s;up|ported upon the coccyx and mu&s;cles below, as in the male.</P>
<P>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> is about an inch and a half long; has no regular pro&s;tate, like the male; but is &s;uppli|ed with a number of &s;mall glandular bodies, placed along the whole interior &s;urface.</P>
<P>The <HI>bladder</HI> is &s;ituated over the vagina and uterus immediately behind the pubes: and is &s;uppo&s;ed to be larger and more capacious than in the other &s;ex.</P>
<P>As the vagina and urethra lie between the rectum and bladder, any di&s;orders in the one will readily bring the other into &s;ympathy.</P>
<P>The <HI>perinaeum</HI> is the &s;eptum or &s;pace between the os externum vaginae and the anus. It is chiefly made up of the &s;phincter ani and vaginae mu&s;cles, the common integuments, and cellular &s;ub&s;tance. In its natural &s;tate it does not much exceed an inch in length, but is con&s;iderably &s;tretched in time of labour.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of the MENSES.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE we proceed to treat of the different the|ories of Conception and Generation, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ider a particular phenomenon, that
<PB N="51" REF="022551_0041_0FB94513EB4DE060">
begins to appear in women about the age of puberty, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the men&s;trual flux.</P>
<P>At the age of 13 or 14 years, and nearly at the &s;ame time that the &s;emen begins to form it&s;elf <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> male, a con&s;iderable change happens to the female: for at this time the blood begins to circulate with an increa|&s;ed force: the pubes begins to be covered with hair, the brea&s;ts to &s;well, and the men&s;es to make their appearance. The ve&s;&s;els of the womb, which in the foetus tran&s;uded a thin whiti&s;h liquor, and in the young girl a &s;ort of &s;erum, begin now to &s;well with blood, and to di&s;po&s;ite &s;ome of it in the cavity of the uterus. They continue &s;o to do for &s;ome days, com|monly three, four, or five; when the uterine ve&s;&s;els gradually contract them&s;elves, and only allow a little &s;erous moi&s;ture to pa&s;s as before, till again, at the end of three or four weeks, they open and di&s;charge a like quantity of blood. This evacuation continues to return periodically, till about the 45th year, though with &s;ome it continues longer, and with others it &s;tops &s;oon after the 40th, or between this and the 50th year.</P>
<P>This di&s;charge from the uterus does not flow in a &s;tream, but gently drills for three, four, or five days; though mo&s;t commonly for three only. The quantity generally evacuated is beween 5 and 10 oun|ces.</P>
<P>The periodical returns are not the &s;ame in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> wo|men; which variety chiefly depends on con&s;titution,
<PB N="52" REF="022551_0042_0FB94515D045E4C0">
manner of life, and climate. But &s;uch an evacuation, at nearer or more di&s;tant periods, &s;eems e&s;&s;entially ne|ce&s;&s;ary both for health and generation. Where it is eith<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> or irregular, bad health is generally the con&s;equence; and women who have pa&s;&s;ed the the age of puberty, for &s;everal years, without any ap|pearance of the men&s;trual di&s;charge, very generally prove barren.</P>
<P>The cau&s;e of this periodical evacuation, peculiar to the females of the human &s;pecies, has been a curi|ous and perplexing &s;ubject of inquiry in all ages.</P>
<P>In the infancy of medicine, when fancy more than judgment influenced the theory, it is not &s;urpri&s;ing that the mo&s;t chimerical rea&s;ons &s;hould have been gi|ven, to account for an appearance &s;o &s;triking and &s;o important. Thus it was attributed to the influence of the moon, from its periodical appearance; to a ferment in the fluids, when fermentation was intro|duced to account for every phenomenon. Men, in other views re&s;pectable, have exerted all their in|genuity in defence of the&s;e theories; but they are now exploded, and the catamenia are &s;uppo&s;ed to ari&s;e from an univer&s;al plethora, or a topical con|ge&s;tion: the&s;e opinions we &s;hall proceed to examine.</P>
<P>From a &s;uperficial view of the &s;everal phenomena, it would appear probable that the men&s;es are occa&s;i|oned by plethora. But this idea of it&s;elf is vague, and will not account for all the appearances. By plethora we under&s;tand, a larger quantity of blood
<PB N="53" REF="022551_0043_0FB94517B889B970">
than is adapted to the capacity of the ve&s;&s;els, either of the whole &s;y&s;tem, or of any particular part. This may depend on the increa&s;e of the ab&s;olute quantity of the fluids; or on a con&s;triction of the ve&s;&s;els. It is the former of the&s;e that &s;eems to be meant by the advocates for a general plethora; and the chief argu|ments &s;eem to be derived from the debility, inactivity, and &s;welling of the brea&s;ts. The two former, though often depending on plethora, may be produced by many other cau&s;es; &s;o that no argument can be drawn for them. The la&s;t by no means &s;hows an increa&s;ed quantity of the fluids in general; it &s;eems much con|nected with the &s;tate of the uterus, and takes place in &s;tates of the &s;y&s;tem very di&s;advantageous for a general <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ulne&s;s. We may, with &s;ome confidence, therefore, reject an opinion that has many direct arguments again&s;t it. For many of the &s;ymptoms are not to be explained by plethora, or by any other &s;uppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>A late and probable opinion is, <Q>that the MENSES depend on a TOPICAL CONGESTION.</Q> This opinion has been for &s;ome time delivered at this uni|ver&s;ity by the ingenious Dr CULLEN; and is &s;up|ported, not only by the mo&s;t plau&s;ible arguments, but by its con&s;i&s;tency with many other apppearances in the human body. We &s;hall content our&s;elves with giving a &s;hort view of it, which may enable tho&s;e to form &s;ome judgment who have not had an opportuni|ty of hearing it from him&s;elf.</P>
<P>He ob&s;erves, "that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rowth of the body de|pends,
<PB N="54" REF="022551_0044_0FB94519231458C0">
upon the increa&s;e of the quantity of fluids gi|ving occa&s;ion to the di&s;tention of the ve&s;&s;els, and thus producing the gradual evolution and full growth of the whole &s;y&s;tem. This evolution does not hap|pen equally in every part of the body at the &s;ame time, but &s;ucce&s;&s;ively according to the different &s;ize and den&s;ity of the &s;everal ve&s;&s;els determined by the origi|nal &s;tamina. Thus the upper parts of the body fir&s;t acquire their natural &s;ize, and then the lower extre|mities. By the &s;ame con&s;titution it &s;eems to be de|termined, that the uterus of the human &s;pecies &s;hould not be con&s;iderably evolved, till the re&s;t of the body is nearly arrived at its full bulk. But as the ve&s;&s;els of every part, by their di&s;tention and growth, increa&s;e in den&s;ity, and give thereby more re&s;i&s;tance to their further growth, at the &s;ame time, by the &s;ame re|&s;i&s;tance, they determine the blood in greater quantity into the parts not yet equally evolved. By this means the whole of the &s;y&s;tem mu&s;t be &s;ucce&s;&s;ively evolved, till every part is brought to that degree of of di&s;tention which is nece&s;&s;ary to bring them to a balance in re&s;pect of den&s;ity and re&s;i&s;tance with one another. Upon the&s;e principles, there will be a period in the growth of the body, when the ve&s;&s;els of the uterus will be di&s;tended till they are in balance with the re&s;t of the &s;y&s;tem; and their con&s;titution may be &s;uch, that their di&s;tention may proceed &s;o far as to open their extremities, terminating in the cavity of the uterus, &s;o as to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">our out blood there; or it
<PB N="55" REF="022551_0045_0FB9451C1FD32010">
may happen, that a certain degree of di&s;tention may be &s;ufficient to irritate and increa&s;e the action of the ve&s;|&s;els, and thereby to produce an haemorrhagic effort, which may force the extremities of the ve&s;&s;els, with the &s;ame effect of pouring out blood.</P>
<P>"In either way, he accounts for the fir&s;t appear|ance of a flow of blood from the uterus in women. In order to this, he does not &s;uppo&s;e any more of a general plethora in the &s;y&s;tem, than what is con&s;tant|ly nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive evolution of the &s;everal parts of it; and he proceeds upon the &s;uppo&s;ition, that the evolution of each particular part mu&s;t e&s;pe|cially depend upon the plethora, or increa&s;ed conge&s;ti|on, in its proper ve&s;&s;els. Thus he &s;uppo&s;es it to hap|pen with re&s;pect to the uterus; but as its plethoric &s;tate, he ob&s;erves, produces an evacuation of blood from its ve&s;&s;els, this evacuation mu&s;t empty the&s;e ve&s;|&s;els more e&s;pecially, and put them again into a relax|ed &s;tate with re&s;pect to the re&s;t of the &s;y&s;tem. This emptied and relaxed &s;tate of the ve&s;&s;els of the uterus will give occa&s;ion to a new conge&s;tion of blood in them, till they are again brought to that degree of di&s;tention that may either force their extremities, or produce a new haemorrhagic effort, that may have the &s;ame effect. Thus an evacuation of blood from the uterus, being once begun by the cau&s;es before mentioned, it mu&s;t, by the operation of the &s;ame cau|&s;es, return after a certain period, and mu&s;t continue to do &s;o till particular circum&s;tances occa&s;ion a con|&s;iderable
<PB N="56" REF="022551_0046_0FB94520669D77B0">
change in the con&s;titution of the uterus. What determines the periods of the&s;e returns to be nearly in the &s;pace of a month, he cannot exactly explain; but &s;uppo&s;es it to depend upon a certain ba|lance between the ve&s;&s;els of the uterus and tho&s;e of the other parts of the body. This mu&s;t determine the fir&s;t periods; and when it does &s;o, it can be under&s;tood, that a con&s;iderable increa&s;e or diminution of the quantity of blood in the whole &s;y&s;tem will have but little effect in increa&s;ing or dimini&s;hing the quantity di&s;tributed to the uterus. It may al&s;o be further ob&s;erved, that when the evacuation has been repeated for &s;ome time at regular periods, it may be &s;uppo&s;ed that the <HI>power of habit,</HI> which &s;o readi|ly takes place in the animal &s;y&s;tem, may have a great &s;hare in determining the periodical motions of the u|terus to be with great regularity, tho' in the mean time con&s;iderable changes may have happened with re&s;pect to the whole &s;y&s;tem."</P>
<P>This theory, though &s;till liable to objections, &s;eems, however, as rational as any opinion that has yet been advanced: nor &s;hall we ever perhaps be able clearly to inve&s;tigate the &s;ecret principles upon which this, and many other phenomena of the animal oeco|nomy, equally intricate and my&s;terious, depend.</P>

<P>That each of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e &s;y&s;tems has had its &s;everal &s;up|porters and antagoni&s;ts, will not be &s;uppri&s;ing, when we con&s;ider the ob&s;curity of the &s;ubject, as well as the extent of learning and brilliancy of imagination which have di&s;tingui&s;hed the &s;everal combatants. HARVEY, our illu&s;trious countryman, belongs to the fir&s;t cla&s;s; the acute LEEUWENHOEK, who perceived living a|nimals, or bodies which re&s;embled them, in the &s;e|men ma&s;culinum, has added lu&s;tre to the &s;econd; and the Count de BUFFON, who&s;e ingenuity and a|cutene&s;s are di&s;tingui&s;hable even in an enlightened na|tion, is the chief &s;upporter of the third opinion.</P>
<P>We &s;hall con&s;ider, at &s;ome length, their &s;everal &s;y&s;tems in another place; it is enough, at pre&s;ent, to ob&s;erve, that the pride of &s;cience, and brilliancy of imagination, have been equally un&s;ucce&s;sful. To elude difficulties which they cannot conquer, modern philo&s;ophers have endeavoured to transfer the que&s;|tion; and by &s;uppo&s;ing the animal already to exi&s;t complete in its &s;everal parts, but of an a&s;toni&s;hing minutene&s;s, have rather laboured to &s;how by what means it is animated, and by what a&s;&s;i&s;tances evol|ved.</P>
<P>This view, when extended to &s;ucce&s;&s;ive genera|tions, at fir&s;t &s;tartles the mode&s;t inquirer by its appa|rent ab&s;urdity, and perplexes the moderate calcula|tor.

It, however, is not more contradictory than many phy&s;iological po&s;itions which have never been controverted; and it is &s;ome addition to its credit, that it is &s;upported by BONNET and HALLER.

Its heart is ob&s;erved to beat: it &s;eems to prepare flu|ids for its own purpo&s;es, and to &s;eparate tho&s;e which are no longer beneficial: in &s;hort, it acquires a di&s;|tinct &s;y&s;tem; from part of which it is &s;upplied with the original portion of its fluids; and which it, in its turn &s;upplies with the &s;ame fluids more highly e|laborated, and more carefully prepared.

<HEAD>SECTION II. Structure of the Ovum in early Ge&s;tation.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the germ is conveyed into the uterus, <HI>impregnation</HI> is &s;aid to take place. The o|vum, &s;oon after its introduction, adheres to &s;ome part of the internal &s;urface of the uterus: at fir&s;t it appears like a &s;mall ve&s;icle, &s;lightly attached; and gradually increa&s;es in bulk, till it apparently comes in contact with the whole cavity of the fundus.</P>
<P>The embryo, or unformed foetus, with placenta, umbilical cord, membranes, and waters, in early ge&s;tation, con&s;titute the ovum; which then appears like a thickened fle&s;hly ma&s;s, the more external la|mellae and other parts, which are afterwards &s;eparate and di&s;tinct, being blended and jumbled in &s;uch a manner that they cannot be readily di&s;tingui&s;hed or traced.</P>
<P>In the progre&s;s of ge&s;tation, the external lamella, or membranous &s;urface, by &s;tretching, grows thinner; the cavity which contains the rudiments of the foetus becomes more apparent; and then a thick va&s;cular part on the out&s;ide of the chorion called <HI>placenta,</HI> can be readily di&s;tingui&s;hed from the membranous porti|on of the ovum.</P>
<P>The external membranous part of the ovum (or bag which contains in its cavity the embryo, funis, and watery fluid in which the embryo floats) is origi|nally
<PB N="61" REF="022551_0051_0FB9452BE8FFB270">
compo&s;ed of three coats: the internal lamella, or that next the foetus, is called <HI>amnios;</HI> the next is the <HI>true chorion;</HI> and the external is called the <HI>fal&s;e</HI> or <HI>&s;pongy chorion.</HI> But it is &s;uppo&s;ed to derive an extra|ordinary lamella immediately from the uterus, which con&s;titutes the external covering of the ovum. This production, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be entirely formed by a continuation of the internal membrane of the u|terus, is at fir&s;t loo&s;ely &s;pread over the ovum, and af|terwards comes in contact with the fal&s;e chorion. The&s;e two lamellae, which form the external va&s;cu|lar &s;urface of the ovum, are much thicker than the internal membranes of the true chorion and amnios; and the proportion which they bear to the other parts is &s;o great, that, in early conception the ma&s;s of the ovum is chiefly compo&s;ed of them. Dr Ruy&s;ch called this exterior coat the <HI>tunica filamento&s;a;</HI> more modern authors, the <HI>fal&s;e</HI> or <HI>&s;pongy chorion.</HI> But Dr Hunter has found the &s;pongy chorion to con&s;i&s;t of two di&s;tinct layers: that which lines the uterus he &s;tiles <HI>membrana caduca</HI> or <HI>decidua,</HI> becau&s;e it is ca&s;t off after delivery: the portion which covers the ovum, <HI>decidua reflexa,</HI> becau&s;e it is reflected from the uterus upon the ovum, forming the connecting medium be|tween them. The portion which covers the ovum is a complete membrane, like the true chorion and am|nios: but that which immediately lines the uterus is imperfect or deficient, being perforated with three

foramina, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> two &s;mall ones, corre&s;ponding with the in&s;ertion of the tubes at the fundus uteri; and a larger ragged perforation oppo&s;ite to the orificium uteri<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dr Hunter's Tables, Pl. xxxiv. fig. 5. <HI>&amp;</HI> 6.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Thus, according to Dr Hunter, the embryo, on its fir&s;t formation in the ovum, and the foetus du|ring the whole time of ge&s;tation, is inclo&s;ed in four membranes, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the double, fal&s;e or &s;pongy chorion, called <HI>membrana decidua,</HI> and <HI>decidua reflexa;</HI> the true chorion, and the amnios, which include a fluid cal|led the <HI>liquor amnii,</HI> in which the embryo floats.</P>
<P>The true chorion and the amnios are decidedly organized membranes, containing ve&s;&s;els, and com|po&s;ed of regular layers of fibres. The decidua, and decidua reflexa, differ in appearance, and &s;eem to re|&s;emble tho&s;e inorganic &s;ub&s;tances which connect in|flamed vi&s;cera. If they be original membranes, and only vi&s;ible from their evolution and increa&s;e, it is not ea&s;y to conceive how the ovum gets behind them, &s;ince the Fallopian tubes are not covered by them. We are therefore inclined to adopt an opini|on &s;ugge&s;ted fir&s;t by Mr Falconer and Mr Crook-&s;hanks, and rendered probable by the experiments of Signor Scarpa, <Q>That they are entirely compo&s;ed of an in&s;pi&s;&s;ated coagulable lymph,</Q> in a manner that we &s;hall have occa&s;ion to explain.</P>
<P>Between the amnion and chorion a quantity of ge|latinous fluid is contained in the early months; and a
<PB N="63" REF="022551_0053_0FB9453182898558">
&s;mall bag, or white &s;peck, is then ob&s;erved on the amnion, near the in&s;ertion of the umbilical cord. It is filled with a white liquor, of a thick milky con|&s;i&s;tance; and is called <HI>ve&s;icula umbilicalus, ve&s;icula al|ba</HI> or <HI>lactea:</HI> it communicates with the umbilical cord by a &s;mall funis, which is made up of an artery and vein. This ve&s;icle, and duct or tube leading from it, are only con&s;picuous in the early months; and afterwards become tran&s;parent, and of con&s;e|quence invi&s;ible<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> Dr Hunter's elegant Plates of the Gravid Uterus, Pl. xxxiv. fig. 2.</NOTE>.

<P>Though the bag, or external parts of the concep|tion, at fir&s;t form a large proportion of the ovum in compari&s;on of the embryo or foetus, in advanced ge|&s;tation the proportions are rever&s;ed. An ovum be|tween the eighth and ninth week after conception, is nearly about the &s;ize of a hen's egg, while the embryo &s;carcely exceeds the weight of a &s;cruple: at three months, the former increa&s;es beyond the mag|nitude of a goo&s;e's egg, the weight above eight oun|ces; but the foetus does not then amount to three ounces: at &s;ix months, the foetus weighs twelve or thirteen ounces, and the placenta and membranes only &s;even or eight: at eight months, the foetus generally weighs &s;omewhat more than five pounds, the &s;ecundines little more than one pound: at birth, the foetus weighs from &s;ix or &s;even to nine pounds,

<P>It is al&s;o exceedingly difficult to determine the age or proportional growth of the foetus.

The progre&s;s of the foetus appears to be much quicker in the early than latter months: but the proportional increa&s;e is attended with difficulty in the calculation; for this, among other rea&s;ons, that we have not an opportunity of knowing the magnitude or weight of the &s;ame foetus in different months.

<DIV5 TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>UMBILICAL CORD.</HEAD>
<P>The foetus is connected to the placenta by the umbilical cord, or navel-&s;tring; which may be defin|ed, "a long va&s;cular rope, compo&s;ed of two arteries and a vein, covered with coats derived from the membranes, and di&s;tended with a quantity of vi&s;cid gelatinous &s;ub&s;tance to which the bulk of the cord is chiefly owing."</P>
<P>The cord always ari&s;es from the centre of the child's belly, but its point of in&s;ertion in the cake is variable. Its &s;hape is &s;eldom quite cylindrical; and its ve&s;&s;els are &s;ometimes twi&s;ted or coiled, &s;ometimes formed into longitudinal &s;ulci. Its diameter is com|monly about the thickne&s;s of an ordinary finger, and its length &s;ufficient to admit the birth of the child with &s;afety, though the placenta &s;hould adhere at the fundus uteri. In length and thickne&s;s, however, it is liable to con&s;iderable variation. The extremity

next the foetus is generally &s;tronge&s;t; and is &s;ome|what weaker and more &s;lender next the placenta, ac|cording to its place of in&s;ertion; which, though commonly not far from the centre, is &s;ometimes towards the very edge. This &s;ugge&s;ts an important advice to practitioners, to be cautious of pulling the rope to extract the placenta when they feel the &s;en|&s;ation of its &s;plitting as it were into two divi&s;ions, which will proportionally weaken its re&s;i&s;tance, and render it liable to be ruptured with a very &s;light de|gree of force in pulling.&mdash;The u&s;e of the cord is to connect the foetus to the cake, to convey the nutri|tious fluid from the mother to the child, and to return what is not employed.</P>

<DIV5 TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>PLACENTA.</HEAD>
<P>THE Placenta, Cake, or After-birth, is a thick, &s;oft, va&s;cular ma&s;s, connected to the foetus by the funis umbilicalis, and to the uterus by means of the &s;pongy chorion, as already explained. It differs in &s;hape and &s;ize, it is thicke&s;t at the centre, and gra|dually becomes thinner towards the edges, where the membranes go off all round, making a complete bag or involucrum to &s;urround the waters, funis, and child.</P>
<P>Its &s;ub&s;tance is chiefly va&s;cular, and probably in &s;ome degree glandular. The ramifications of the ve&s;&s;els are very minute, which are unravelled by ma|ceration, and, when injected, exhibit a mo&s;t beauti|ful

appearance re&s;embling the bu&s;hy tops of a tree. It has an external convex, and an internal concave, &s;urface. The former is divided into a number of &s;mall lobes and fi&s;&s;ures, by means of which its adhe|&s;ion to the uterus is more firmly &s;ecured. This lo|bulated appearance is mo&s;t remarkable when the cake has been ra&s;hly &s;eparated from the uterus; for the membrana decidua, or connecting membrane be|tween it and the uterus, being then torn, the mo&s;t vio|lent and alarming haemorrhagies frequently en&s;ue.</P>
<P>The internal concave &s;urface of the placenta is loo&s;ely covered with the amnion, and by the chorion more immediately and intimately. From this in|ternal &s;urface ari&s;e innumerable ramifications of veins and arteries, which ino&s;culate and ana&s;tomo&s;e with one another; and at la&s;t the different branches unite, and form the <HI>funis umbilicalis.</HI></P>
<P>The after-birth adheres to every part of the internal &s;urface of the uterus, as at the po&s;terior and anterior &s;uperior parts, laterally; and &s;ometimes, though more rearly, part of the cake extends over the <HI>orifi|cium uteri;</HI> from whence, when the orifice begins to dilate, the mo&s;t frightful and dangerous floodings a|ri&s;e.

the placentae adhere, they have generally the chorion in common; but each foetus has its di&s;tinct amnion.

<P>The human placenta, according to Dr Hunter, is &s;imilar in &s;tructure to that of quadrupeds: and &s;eems to be compo&s;ed of two di&s;tinct &s;y&s;tems of parts, a &s;pongy or cellular, and a va&s;cular &s;ub&s;tance. It has of con&s;equence two di&s;tinct &s;ets of ve&s;&s;els. The &s;pon|gy or cellular part, formed by the decidua, is derived from the mother; and, if filled with injection, will increa&s;e the placenta to nearly twice its ordinary thickne&s;s; the more internal va&s;cular part belongs entirely to the foetus, and can only be injected from the cord, as the &s;pongy part by the filling the ve&s;&s;els of the uterus.

In advanced ge&s;tation, it adheres intimately to the former membrane, and is with difficulty &s;eparated when the double decidua comes off entire; but the outer lamella more com|monly adheres to the uterus after the placenta and other membranes are expelled, and is afterwards ca&s;t off with the clean&s;ings.</P>
<P>The decidua reflexa becomes thicker and more va&s;|cular as it approaches the placenta, and is then blended with its &s;ub&s;tance, con&s;tituting the cellular or <HI>mater|nal</HI> part of the cake, as it is termed by Dr Hunter.

<P>THOUGH the uterus gradually encrea&s;es in &s;ize from the moment of conception till full time, and although its di&s;tention is proportioned to that of the ovum, with regard to its contents, it is &s;trictly &s;peaking, never completely di&s;tended: for, in early ge&s;tation, they are entirely confined to the fundus; and, at full time, the finger can be pa&s;&s;ed for &s;ome way within the orificium uteri without touching any part of the membranes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dr Hunter'<HI>s</HI> Tables, Pl.

This is proved from &s;everal in&s;tances of extra|uterine foetu&s;es, where the uterus, though there were no contents, was nearly of the &s;ame &s;ize, from the additional quantity of fluids tran&s;mitted, as if the ovum had been contained within its cavity. Boehme|rus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> Boehmeri Obs. Anatom. Rarior. Fa&s;ciculus notabil. circa uterum human.

The uterus is painted of a con&s;iderable &s;ize, though the foetus was contained in the ovarium.</P>
<P>The gravid uterus is of different &s;ize in different women; and will vary according to the bulk of the foetus and involucra. The &s;ituation al&s;o varies ac|cording to the increa&s;e of its contents, and the po&s;i|tion of the body. For the fir&s;t two or three months, the cavity of the fundus is triangular as before im|pregnation; but as the uterus &s;tretches, it gradually acquires a more rounded form. In general, the ute|rus never ri&s;es directly upwards, but inclines a little obliquely; mo&s;t commonly to the right &s;ide<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Dr. Hunter's Tables, Pl. i. iii. and iv.</NOTE>: its po&s;ition is never, however, &s;o oblique as to prove the &s;ole cau&s;e either of preventing or retarding delivery.</P>
<P>Though con&s;iderable changes are occa&s;ioned by the gradual di&s;tention of the uterus, it is difficult to
<PB N="77" REF="022551_0067_0FB9454DA5F813D8">
judge of pregnancy from appearances in the early months. For the fir&s;t three months, the os tincae feels &s;mooth and even, and its orifice is nearly as &s;mall as in the virgin &s;tate. When any difference can be perceived, it will con&s;i&s;t in the increa&s;ed length of the projecting tubercle of the uterus, and and the &s;hortening of the vagina from the de&s;cent of the fundus uteri through the pelvis. This change in the po&s;ition of the uterus, by which the projecting tubercle appears to be lengthened, and the vagina pro|portionally &s;hortened, chiefly happens from the third to the fifth month. From this period the cervix begins to &s;tretch and be di&s;tended, fir&s;t at the upper part; and then the os tincae begins al&s;o to &s;uffer con&s;ider|able changes in its figure and appearance. The tu|bercle &s;hortens, and the orifice expands: but, during the whole term of ge&s;tation, the mouth of the uterus is &s;trongly cemented with a ropy mucus, which lines it and the cervix, and begins to be di&s;charged on the approach of labour. In the la&s;t weeks, when the cervix uteri is completly di&s;tended, the uterine orifice begins to form an eliptical tube, in&s;tead of a fi&s;&s;ure; and &s;ometimes, e&s;pecially when the parietes of the abdomen are relaxed by repeated pregnancy, di&s;ap|pears entirely, and is without the reach of the finger in touching. Hence the os uteri is not placed in the direction of the axis of the womb, as has gene|rally been &s;uppo&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="022551_0068_0FB9454F9F60D258">
The progre&s;&s;ive increa&s;e of the abdominal tumor, from the &s;tretching of the fundus, affords a more de|ci&s;ive mark of the exi&s;tence and period of pregnancy than any others; and the progre&s;s is nearly as fol|lows.</P>
<P>About the fourth, or between the fourth and fifth month, the fundus uteri begins to ri&s;e above the pubes or brim of the pelvis, and the cervix to be &s;omewhat di&s;tended. In the fifth month, the belly &s;wells like a ball with the &s;kin ten&s;e, the fundus extends about half way between pubes and navel, and the neck is &s;en&s;ibly &s;hortened. In the &s;eventh month, the fundus, or &s;uperior part of the uterine tumor, advan|ces as far as the umbilicus; and the the cervix is then nearly three-fourths di&s;tended. In the eighth, it reaches midway between the navel a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d &s;crobiculus cordis; and, in the ninth, to the &s;crobiculus it&s;elf, the neck then being entirely di&s;tended; which, with the os tincae, become the weake&s;t parts of the ute|rus. Thus at full time the uterus occupies all the umbilical and hypoga&s;tric regions: its &s;hape is al|mo&s;t pyriform, that is, more rounded above than below, and having a &s;tricture on that part which is &s;urrounded by the brim of the pelvis<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> Dr Hunter's Tables, Pl. xvi.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>During the progre&s;s of di&s;tention, the &s;ub&s;tance of the uterus becomes much loo&s;er, of a &s;ofter texture, and more va&s;cular than before conception; and the diameter of its veins is &s;o much enlarged that they

<P>The arteries pa&s;s from the uterus thro' the decidua, and open into the &s;ub&s;tance of the placenta in an oblique direction.

<P>The mu&s;cular &s;tructure of the gravid uterus is ex|tremely difficult to be traced with any exactne&s;s. In the wombs of women who die in labour, or &s;oon after delivery, fibres running in various directions are ob&s;ervable more or le&s;s circular.</P>

<P>The appendages of the uterus &s;uffer al&s;o con&s;idera|ble changes; for the tubes, ovaries, and ligaments, gradually go off below the fundus as it &s;tretches, and at full time are almo&s;t entirely obliterated. At full time, e&s;pecially in a fir&s;t pregnancy, when the womb

ri&s;es higher than in &s;ub&s;equent impregnations, the ligamenta rotunda are con&s;iderably &s;tretched; and to this cau&s;e tho&s;e pains are probably owing which &s;trike from the belly downwards in the direction of the&s;e va&s;cular ropes, which are often very painful and di&s;|tre&s;&s;ing towards the latter end of ge&s;tation. Again, as the uterus, which is chiefly enlarged towards the fundus, at full time &s;tretches into the cavity of the abdomen without any &s;upport, leaving the broad li|gaments below the mo&s;t bulky part, we can readily &s;ee, that by pulling at the umbilical cord to deliver the placenta, before the uterus is &s;ufficiently con|tracted, the fundus may be pulled down through the mouth of the womb, even though no great violence be employed. This is &s;tyled the <HI>inver&s;ion of the uterus;</HI> and is a very dreadful, and generally fatal accident.

<P>In &s;ome rare in&s;tances, the force of labour which propels the child where the cord is &s;hort naturally, or rendered &s;o by circumvolutions round the body of the child, may, when the placenta adheres to the fundus uteri, bring it down &s;o near the os tincae, that little force would afterwards be &s;ufficient to complete the inver&s;ion.

<HEAD>SECTION VI. Manner of Circulation between the Mother and Foetus.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER many di&s;putes on this &s;ubject, it is now generally allowed, that the communication between the parent and child is carried on entirely by means of the placenta, who&s;e &s;pongy &s;urface ad|heres to the internal &s;urface of the womb, and re|ceives the finer part of the arterial blood of the mo|ther by ab&s;orption. No ana&s;tomo&s;es of blood-ve&s;&s;els between them have yet been clearly &s;hown by the experiments of any phy&s;iologi&s;t; nor has any colour|ed injection been pu&s;hed from the uterus into the in|terior va&s;cular part of the cake, nor from the foetus or umbilical ve&s;&s;els into the cellular part, except by the force of extrava&s;ation, This cellular part of the placenta is probably derived from the decidua; and is not a &s;pongy inorganic &s;ub&s;tance, merely intended for the attachment of the cake; but probably a regu|larly con&s;tructed and organi&s;ed part belonging to the mother. The cells, therefore, cannot be filled by injection from the umbilical ve&s;&s;els, though an injec|tion will readily pa&s;s from the ve&s;&s;els of the uterus.</P>
<P>We find the &s;ame &s;tructure obtain in cows, where the cellular can be ea&s;ily &s;eparated from the va&s;cular part, and the di&s;tinct property of each a&s;certained.</P>
<P>As the &s;tructure of the cellular part of the placen|ta,
<PB N="83" REF="022551_0073_0FB9455BE1F5EC88">
is &s;omewhat &s;imilar to that of the more &s;imple glands, it may be rea&s;onably inferred, that it is inten|ded for other purpo&s;es be&s;ides merely ab&s;orbing blood and conveying it to the umbilical ve&s;&s;els of the child. It &s;eems probable, therefore, that an operation &s;imi|lar to &s;ecretion is carried in the placenta; that the veins and arteries of the foetus, in the va&s;cular part of the cake, are continuous; and that ab&s;orbents ari&s;e in the follicles, which &s;oon terminate in veins. From this view it appears, that the placenta is not only the connecting medium between the mother and child, intended for conveying and returning nutritious fluid from the one to the other, but al&s;o changes and prepares it, in a particular manner, for circulating through the minute ve&s;&s;els of the delicate foetus.</P>
<P>This mode of circulation is admirably well contri|ved for the pre&s;ervation of the child from di&s;ea&s;es which would otherwi&s;e be communicated from the mother, if the mutual communication were kept up by continuous ve&s;&s;els, the foetus would con&s;tant|ly be in danger of &s;uffering when the mother's circu|lation was accelerated or otherwi&s;e di&s;turbed.</P>

the umbilical cord to the foetus for its &s;upport and increa&s;e circulates in the &s;y&s;tem of the non-natus in the following manner.</P>
<P>The blood pa&s;&s;es directly from the placenta into the umbilical vein; which running along the funis, perforates the belly of the foetus, and enters under the liver, where it divides into two branches, nearly at half a right angle. One of the&s;e branches, called the <HI>ductus venofus,</HI> carries part of this liquor immediate|ly to the lower vena cava. The other carries the re&s;t to the vena portarum; where, after circulating through the liver, it al&s;o gets into the vena cava, and &s;o to the heart: but the circulation here is carried on without any nece&s;&s;ity for the lungs being dilated. For foetu&s;es have an oval hole open between the two auricles of the heart, and a large communicating canal, called <HI>canalis arterio&s;us,</HI> going between the pulmonary artery and aorta; which two pa&s;&s;ages al|low the re&s;t of this circulating fluid, that returns by the cava &s;uperior, to be tran&s;mitted to the aorta, with|out pa&s;&s;ing thro' the lungs.</P>
<P>The blood is returned from the foetus by the <HI>arter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> umbilicales,</HI> which take their ri&s;e &s;ometimes from the trunk of the aorta, and &s;ometimes from the iliac arteries of the foetus; and, running by the external &s;ides of the bladder, a&s;cend to go out at the navel.</P>
<P>Thus there are three circulations belonging to the foetus, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> one between the uterus and placenta, by ab&s;orption; one between the placenta and foetus,

The &s;pine is rounded, the head reclines forward to|wards the knees, which are drawn up to the belly, while the heels are drawn backwards towards the breech, and the hands and arms are folded round the knees and legs. The head of the child is generally downwards. This does not proceed, as was com|monly alleged, from the funis not being exactly in the middle of the child's body, for it is not &s;u&s;pended by the funis: the rea&s;on is, becau&s;e the &s;uperior parts are much larger and heavier in proportion than the inferior. When other parts pre&s;ent, it &s;eems owing to the motion of the child altering its figure when the waters are much dimini&s;hed in quantity, or to circumvolutions of the cord: when the po&s;ition is once altered, it becoms confined or locked in the uterus, and cannot ea&s;ily re&s;ume its original po|&s;ture.</P>

<P>The head is very large in proportion to the re&s;t of the body; the cranial bones are &s;oft and yielding, and the &s;utures not yet united; &s;o that the bulk of the head may be dimini&s;hed in every direction, and its pa&s;&s;age con&s;equently be rendered more commo|dious.

<P>The cavity of the thorax is le&s;s in proportion than after re&s;piration. The lungs are &s;maller, more compact, of a red colour like the liver, and will &s;ink in water; but putrefaction, and a particular emphy|&s;ema, as in di&s;ea&s;es of cattle, and blowing into them, will make them &s;wim: which &s;hould prevent us from ha&s;tily determining, from this circum&s;tance, whether a child has breathed or not; which we are often called on to do. Neither does their &s;inking prove that the child never breathed; for a child may die, or be &s;trangled in the birth, or immediately after, before the lungs are fully inflated.</P>

<P>THE impregnated ovum, or rudiments of the foetus, is not always received from the ovarium by the tuba Fallopiana, to be thence conveyed into the cavity of the uterus. For there are in&s;tances where the foetus &s;ometimes remains in the ovarium, and &s;ometimes even in the tube; or where it drops out of the ovarium, mi&s;&s;es the tube, falls into the cavity of the abdomen, takes root in the neighbouring parts, and is thereby nouri&s;hed: But they are always le&s;s than the uterine foetu&s;es; they either do not receive &s;o much nouri&s;hment as in the &s;ucculent uterus, or they generally come to their full growth long before their common term.</P>

<HEAD>III. MONSTERS.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY con&s;iderable deviation in the &s;tructure of a foetus from the common order of nature is con&s;idered as mon&s;trous, whether &s;uch deviation be con&s;i&s;tent with life or not; and the production is commonly termed a <HI>mon&s;ter.</HI> This idea of a mon&s;ter will, however, comprehend all the variety that has been ob&s;erved; and the&s;e we &s;hall endeavour to reduce under four ge|neral heads.</P>
<P N="1">1. Tho&s;e productions which have &s;upernumerary parts. The&s;e include all the variety, from the famous in|&s;tance of the Bohemian &s;i&s;ters, who were joined together by the glutei mu&s;cles and the inte&s;tinal canal, to tho&s;e foetu&s;es which have only an additional finger or toe.</P>
<P N="2">2. Tho&s;e who&s;e parts are defective; which has hap|pened with re&s;pect to every part of the animal body.</P>

exemplified in the mule produced by the mixed gene|ration of an a&s;s and mare.</P>
<P>IT is very difficult to give an explanation of the&s;e deviations, nor indeed is it to be expected, while the proce&s;s of generation is it&s;elf &s;o great a my&s;tery. If we allow with BONNET, &amp;c. that a germ or embryo of the future production exi&s;ts in the female previous to the impregnation, many of the&s;e deviations mu&s;t to it be referred. Though this, however removes the difficulty, it by no means &s;olves it. Supernumerary parts may be more readily accounted for: for if two ova become contiguous in their gelatinous &s;tate, they may ea&s;ily unite: and this contiguity and union will prevent the evolution of many of the parts, and the production will appear as one. This we can &s;ay with &s;ome certainty has been often the ca&s;e, as in the Bo|hemian &s;i&s;ters mentioned under the fir&s;t &s;pecies; and the union in the different mon&s;ters has at various times been &s;een gradually more and more complete, &s;o that mo&s;t &s;upernumerary parts evidently proceed from this cau&s;e.</P>

<P>THE <HI>mons veneris</HI> and <HI>labia pudendorum</HI> are liable both to <HI>oedematous</HI> and inflammatory &s;wellings, and to tumors, chiefly of the <HI>&s;teatomatous</HI> kind. The latter &s;ometimes, from &s;mall beginnings, gradually en|large

to an enormous &s;ize: but as they commonly adhere by a &s;mall peduncle, their exci&s;ion is a &s;im|ple operation, and &s;eldom followed with con&s;iderable haemorrhage; they leave but &s;light marks behind them, and for the mo&s;t part ea&s;ily heal.</P>
<P>Oedematous &s;wellings are of two kinds; general or local. The fir&s;t are the attendants of an univer&s;al leucophlegma&s;ia, the con&s;equence of a drop&s;ical habit; and the treatment mu&s;t then be conducted on gene|ral principles, with a view to correct the fault in the habit. The latter ari&s;e from venous plethora, and the pre&s;&s;ure of the bulky uterus interrupting the re|turning blood from the lower extremities; hence the &s;erous part is extrava&s;ated, and forms a local oedema. The &s;welling at fir&s;t appears on the feet and legs, and gradually extends to the thighs and labia. Though &s;ometimes formidable, it is entirely &s;ymptomatic of pregnancy; and for the mo&s;t part, entirely &s;ub&s;ides &s;oon after delivery.</P>
<P>The <HI>labia,</HI> when inflamed or abraded; from what|ever cau&s;e, (as from the involuntary di&s;charge of a|crid urine, or any other acrimonious di&s;charge which excoriates the parts), may grow together if not pre|vented by frequent bathing; &s;hould this happen, they mu&s;t be &s;eparated with a &s;calpel, and the like acci|dent by proper care in future prevented.</P>
<P>The <HI>clitoris</HI> &s;ometimes becomes enlarged greatly beyond the ordinary &s;ize. When incommodiou&s;ly
<PB N="94" REF="022551_0084_0FB9457372E08940">
elongated, amputation may be performed with &s;afe|ty. The enlargement of the <HI>nymphae</HI> al&s;o requires the &s;ame treatment.</P>
<P>Extirpation of the <HI>carunculoe myrtiformes</HI> &s;ometimes al&s;o becomes requi&s;ite; but <HI>fungous excre&s;cences</HI> of the&s;e parts may generally be removed by cau&s;tic, or any more gentle e&s;charotic application.</P>
<P>The <HI>urethra,</HI> too, is &s;ubject to di&s;orders and ac|cidents; &s;uch as fungous excre&s;cences, contu&s;ion, laceration, inflammation, gangrene, and the &s;tone.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e may, when large, be cut out with the &s;ci&s;&s;ars, or de&s;troyed by the application of the bougie. All the others, as now enumerated, may be the con&s;equence of a &s;tone &s;ticking in the pa&s;&s;age: when the expul&s;ion cannot be forwarded by the &s;emicupium, the &s;tone mu&s;t be extracted, either by dilating the urethra it&s;elf, or cutting upon it through the vagina. The &s;ymptoms of a &s;tone in the female bladder, towards its neck, or in the ure|thra, are nearly &s;imilar to tho&s;e which occur in the male, and the treatment and operation are too well known to require a de&s;cription.</P>

<P>NARROWNESS OF THE VAGINA &s;ometimes oc|curs. This may be either natural, from original conformation; or accidental, in con&s;equence of di&s;|ea&s;e. Cicatrices may be formed from a laceration af|ter &s;evere labour; in con&s;equence of ulceration, ero&s;ion, &amp;c. Preternatural con&s;trictions may like|wi&s;e be induced, from the u&s;e of &s;typtic applications, or fumigations. The cure may be attempted by emol|lient fomentations; as by the &s;teams of warm water directed to the parts; and by introducing a &s;mall tent of compre&s;&s;ed &s;ponge, which hath been previou&s;ly moi&s;tened and kept tight bound with tape till dry. This by imbibing the moi&s;ture, will &s;well and ex|pand; and thus the aperture will be gradually &s;trech|ed. The tent mu&s;t be withdrawn every day, by means of a thread fixed through its middle, and
<PB N="96" REF="022551_0086_0FB94578650E34C0">
a larger one introduced in its &s;tead. The &s;ponge &s;hould be &s;mooth, and lubricated with pomatum. This proce&s;s mu&s;t be continued, till the pa&s;&s;age be|comes &s;ufficiently enlarged.</P>
<P>If the&s;e methods fail, recour&s;e mu&s;t then be had to the knife; though, in the &s;imple contraction of the cavity of the vagina this expedient is &s;eldom nece&s;&s;a|ry, and the attempt is often attended with the utmo&s;t danger; therefore &s;hould never be determined on till every other method has failed. The dilation, which previous to impregnation &s;eemed impracticable, has very often been accompli&s;hed by labour-pains.</P>
<P>Sometimes there is a natural defect in the genital parts, from an original mal-conformation; &s;o that the vagina is either imperforated altogether, or a foramen only remains &s;ufficient to tran&s;mit the men&s;trual blood. If, from coalition of the parietes of the vagina, the pa&s;|&s;age be entirely &s;hut up, an attempt to force it would be vain. The orifice in the latter ca&s;e will afford a pro|per direction for the knife; but the operator mu&s;t be cautious not to mi&s;take the urethra for the pa&s;&s;age into the vagina.</P>

If the&s;e complaints re&s;i&s;t the common means of relief, &s;uch as frequent bathing, fomentations, catapla&s;ms, &amp;c. and terminate in gangrene, leaving behind them fi&s;tulous &s;ores with callous lips, unle&s;s a cure be effected by time, they generally continue in a fi&s;tu|lous &s;tate, without a po&s;&s;ibility of remedy.</P>
<P>The <HI>uterus,</HI> like other parts, may al&s;o be affected with various di&s;orders: The&s;e are chiefly inflammation and its con&s;equences; &s;arcomatous, fungous, and po|lypous tumors; &s;toney concretions, drop&s;y, tympa|nites, &s;cirrhous and cancerous tumors.</P>
<P>When the <HI>os tincae</HI> is &s;hut up, either originally, or by cicatrix in con&s;equence of &s;uppuration, laceration, ulceration, or the like, the ca&s;e is generally incur|able; except the men&s;trual blood by its weight force a pa&s;&s;age, or point out the manner of procuring it: if that fails, a future &s;terility is the unavoidable con|&s;equence.</P>
<P>Original conformations of this kind &s;eldom admit of any treatment, for this rea&s;on: Becau&s;e, be&s;ides the imperviou&s;ne&s;s of the os tincae, the uterus it&s;elf &s;ometimes appears a &s;olid body without any cavity in the centre.</P>

ari&s;e from all parts of the vagina and uterus. They happen to women at every period of life, but mo&s;t frequently towards the decline. They gene|rally proceed from an ob&s;truction of the &s;mall glands of the parts, and are le&s;s or more difficult to di&s;cover or remove, as their origin is low or high in the va|gina or uterus. Their texture or con&s;i&s;tence is very different; &s;ometimes they are tender and muci|laginous, like tho&s;e in the no&s;e; at other times firm and &s;olid, like a wen. Their exi&s;tence is di&s;covered by a careful inquiry into the circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e, and by an examination of the parts; &s;ometimes their ba&s;is is very con&s;iderable; though they generally adhere by a &s;mall neck. They &s;ometimes, like &s;cir|rhi, continue indolent for many years; and are al&s;o liable to degenerate into &s;cirrhus and cancer. In their milde&s;t &s;tate, they are attended with perpetual &s;tillicidium from the vagina, and &s;ometimes with profu&s;e and dangerous floodings. They mu&s;t be carefully di&s;tingui&s;hed from <HI>herniae, prolap&s;us uteri,</HI> and other tumors. Polypi, when curable by an ope|ration, may generally be removed by ligature; a &s;afer method than cutting with the &s;calpel, as they are often &s;upplied with large blood-ve&s;&s;els, from which there may be danger of a fatal haemorrhagy.</P>
<P>For fixing the ligature, the fingers of the operator will be &s;ometimes &s;ufficient. When this method fails, Dr HUNTER's needle, or M. LEVRET's dou|ble

By this means the circulation in the tumor is &s;topped, and in two or three days the polypus will drop off. In fixing the ligature, the operator mu&s;t be cautious not to mi&s;take the tubercle of the os tincae for the po|lypous tumor; a blunder which would prove of fatal con&s;equence to the patient.</P>

The fir&s;t produces &s;ymptoms of debility, which are generally &s;tyled <HI>chlo|rotic:</HI> and the indications of cure are, to &s;trenghen the &s;tomach and &s;y&s;tem; which is chiefly effected by bark, chalybeats, regimen, and the cold bath. Tor|por and rigidity of the uterine ve&s;&s;els may be &s;ometimes removed by the means u&s;ually employed for relaxing torpor and rigidity of the whole &s;y&s;tem: or by pro|moting the action of the uterine ve&s;&s;els, more parti|cularly by &s;timulating the neighbouring organs. This is chiefly to be attempted in tho&s;e ca&s;es where nature makes an effort; but, from debility or &s;ome other cir|cum&s;tance, is unable to accompli&s;h it. She is then to be gently a&s;&s;i&s;ted, not forced. Aloetic purges, tinctu|ra melampodii, &s;mall do&s;es of calomel, or electricity, are the u&s;ual remedies; but they ought to be cauti|ou&s;ly and prudently u&s;ed. Tinctura fuliginis, or an

extract prepared from it, and given in the do&s;e &scruple;j twice or thrice a day, is a more &s;afe, and often mo&s;t efficacious medicine in the latter ca&s;e, along with the foetid gums. But the warm bath, or a change of climate, are the mo&s;t powerful anti&s;pa&s;modics, and may be often &s;ucce&s;sfully employed when other reme|dies fail.</P>
<P>Though we are in general able to di&s;tingui&s;h the&s;e two cau&s;es of debility and torpor, yet it mu&s;t be allowed, that retention of the men&s;es, from every cau&s;e, &s;oon induces a debility, which, without &s;ome attention, may be mi&s;taken for the original defect.</P>

<P N="1">1. <HI>Suppre&s;&s;ion.</HI> The men&s;es are rarely &s;uppre&s;&s;ed in con&s;equence of weakne&s;s: though it mu&s;t be ob|&s;erved, that they are readily affected by any general di&s;|order in the habit: and, in that view, the deviation is to be con&s;idered merely as &s;ymptomatic: and the cure will depend on correcting the fault in the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Spa&s;m, or rigidity of the uterine ve&s;&s;els, is, per|haps, a more frequent cau&s;e than any other, occa&s;i|oned, more remotely, by cold, irregular pa&s;&s;ions, plethora, &amp;c. The cure mu&s;t then be directed with a

Venae&s;ection, the warm bath, and em|menagogues, &s;uited to the peculiar circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e, are the proper remedies. Medicines under the name of <HI>emmenagogue</HI> are not, however, to be re|lied on; and the means employed for re&s;toring the evacuation are mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sfully exhibited when our efforts concur with the&s;e of nature. Violent uterine emmenagogues, &s;o far as they may have any tenden|cy to affect the general health, are always improper and frequently hurtful. In a &s;imple &s;uppre&s;&s;ion, it is often &s;ufficient to keep the patient quiet; to avoid cold, and irregularities of diet; with the u&s;e of the warm bath, &s;emicupium, or &s;teams of water directed to the uterus, when the expected period approaches.</P>
<P>When the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion is more ob&s;tinate, aloetic purges, electricity, and the mo&s;t powerful relaxants and anti&s;pa&s;modics, mu&s;t be employed.</P>

<P>Some women men&s;truate with difficulty, the ute|rine efforts to throw out blood are painful and im|perfect, the di&s;charge is &s;canty; but the appearance continues for many days: during which the irritati|on is communicated from the uterus to the neigh|bouring parts, and, by &s;ympathy, all over the &s;y&s;|tem; very generally producing pains about the arti|culation of the &s;acrum, from thence to the ilia and

<P>The&s;e &s;ymptoms are be&s;t relieved, by avoiding cold and irregularities for &s;everal days preceding the ac|cu&s;tomed period; by u&s;ing actual warmth then, and more particularly during the time of men&s;trua|tion; by drinking, every night before bed-time, and in &s;maller quantities through the day, any mild, dilu|ting, tepid drinks; by frequent re&s;t on a bed or &s;o|fa; and, occa&s;ionally, by the u&s;e of opiates.</P>
<P>II. MAENORRHAGIA.&mdash;The men&s;es are only to be con&s;idered as exce&s;&s;ive, when the periods recur &s;o often, the duration is &s;o long, or the quantity eva|cuated &s;o great, as to induce debility, with its u&s;ual &s;ymptoms. In all the&s;e ca&s;es, Leucorrhoea is a fre|quent attendant. The cau&s;es may be active or pa&s;|&s;ive, in common with other preternatural haemor|rhagies. Of the former are, Plethora, univer&s;al or local; increa&s;ed action of the ve&s;&s;els from fever; ex|ce&s;&s;ive exerci&s;e, pa&s;&s;ions; &s;timuli applied to the ute|rus, or neighbouring parts; and every cau&s;e which determines the blood more forcibly to the uterus. Of the latter, Relaxation, univer&s;al or local. To di&s;tin|gui&s;h <HI>active</HI> from <HI>pa&s;&s;ive</HI> maenorrhagia, is of the ut|mo&s;t con&s;equence in directing the treatment.</P>

heat, thir&s;t, quick full pul&s;e, and other febrile &s;ymp|toms, &s;he mu&s;t be exceedingly cautious of giving a &s;udden check to the flow, till the ve&s;&s;els have been &s;ufficiently emptied, naturally from the di&s;charge, or by the prudent u&s;e of venae&s;ection. A &s;pare cool|ing diet, cool air, open belly, and the &s;tricte&s;t anti|phlogi&s;tic regimen, are then e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary. Heat, violent agitations and exerci&s;e, and every cor|poreal and mental exertion, &s;hould be avoided.</P>
<P>In <HI>pa&s;&s;ive</HI> maenorrhagia, the di&s;charge, mu&s;t be-moderated by &s;typtics and opiates given internally; by cold wet applications to the pubes and external parts; by confinement to a horizontal po&s;ture on a firm bed, with hair matre&s;s, and few bed cloaths; by giving cold a&s;tringent drinks; and by avoiding e|very cau&s;e of irritation.</P>
<P>The vis vitae mu&s;t be duly &s;upported by nouri&s;hing diet; but while the flow continues, every thing of the &s;timulating kind under the name of <HI>cordial</HI> mu&s;t be very cautiou&s;ly u&s;ed.</P>
<P>When the haemorrhagy hath entirely cea&s;ed, the interval mu&s;t be improved to u&s;e the proper means for re&s;toring the con&s;titution. Of the&s;e, &s;trengthening diet, the moderate u&s;e of cordials, gentle exerci&s;e, the Pe|ruvian bark, and chalybeates, are principally to be relied on. In &s;ome pa&s;&s;ive ca&s;es, the &s;low is almo&s;t con&s;tant cordials and tonics are then particularly in|dicated: and gentle exerci&s;e in a carriage has been often known to moderate or &s;uppre&s;s the flow.</P>

Under this article of <HI>Maenorrhagia</HI> may al&s;o be mentioned,</P>
<P><HI>Irregularities towards the ce&s;&s;ation of the men&s;trua.</HI></P>
<P>The men&s;es generally become irregular towards their final ce&s;&s;ation. This critical period in the fe|male con&s;titution is commonly announced by irregular interruptions, unexpected returns, or immoderate di&s;charges; in many in&s;tances, by exce&s;&s;ive, long con|tinued, or frequent and alarming floodings. The &s;ymptoms a&s;&s;ume a variety of appearance, as influen|ced by con&s;titution, habit, manner of life, and the &s;tate of the uterine &s;y&s;tem. They are rather to be con&s;idered as the con&s;equence of a general change in the con&s;titution, which terminates the age of child|bearing, than merely the effects of an accidental inter|ruption, or exce&s;s of the periodical evacuation.</P>
<P>Every important change which the con&s;titution &s;uffers, is introduced by &s;low and in&s;en&s;ible degrees: the alarming &s;ymptoms which at this period occur, proceed from the decline of life &s;trictly &s;peaking, a di&s;ea&s;ed &s;tate of the uterus, or may be a&s;cribed to mi&s;|taken management. In &s;ome women, the men&s;es take their leave more abruptly; in other more &s;low|ly; and no material inconvenience is perceived in ei|ther ca&s;e. Women who never had children, nor en|joyed good regular health, or who&s;e con&s;titution is impaired by frequent labours or mi&s;carriage, the ner|vous
<PB N="110" REF="022551_0100_0FB94220AB587F20">
and delicate, are more commonly the &s;ubjects of complaint towards this period.</P>
<P>The particular &s;ymptoms and con&s;titution, the age of the patient, her manner of life, and other circum|&s;tances formerly mentioned, will direct the proper treatment.</P>
<P>If no obvious inconvenience ari&s;es from the ab|&s;ence of the men&s;es, it would &s;urely be ab&s;urd to in|jure the con&s;titution by a &s;udden change of manner of living, by ab&s;temious diet and debilitating eva|cuations. On the contrary, if the &s;ymptoms indi|cate a full habit and plethoric diathe&s;is, venae&s;ection, purgatives, and &s;pare diet, will then be nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Frequent or immoderate floodings, attended with &s;ymptoms of debility, mu&s;t be treated as already di|rected. In relaxed weakly women, the con&s;equences are always to be le&s;s or more dreaded: the flux mu&s;t be checked by cold wet applications; the painful &s;ymptoms relieved by opiates; and the con&s;titution afterwards &s;trengthened by nutritious diet, bitters, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Shooting pains about the region of the uterus, the pubes, and brea&s;ts, along with frequent floodings, or leucorrhoea, indicate &s;u&s;picion of &s;cirrhous or cance|rous di&s;po&s;ition, and are generally preludes of di&s;ea&s;e which &s;oon ends fatally, or renders the remains of life uncomfortable.</P>
<P>Floodings, &s;eemingly alarming and hazardous

They may generally be modera|ted by &s;ome of the means formerly recommended in <HI>maenorrhagia;</HI> and if the &s;trength be kept up, though the haemorrhagy may occa&s;ionally recur at vague and irregular periods, even for two or three years, I have never, in the cour&s;e a long practice, known it to end fatally in a &s;ingle in&s;tance: a complete recove|ry is generally at la&s;t accompli&s;hed, and the con&s;ti|tution re&s;tored, with the pro&s;pect of a &s;tate of good health for a con&s;iderable time after.</P>
<P>III. LEUCORRHOEA, <HI>Fluor Albus,</HI> or <HI>Whites,</HI> is a di&s;charge of &s;erous or mucous matter of a whiti&s;h colour, from the vagina. Its &s;ource is chiefly &s;up|po&s;ed to be from the ve&s;&s;els which pour out the mem|&s;trual blood; and the di&s;charge is therefore con&s;idered as a mere depravity, or morbid &s;tate, of the catame|nia: but it probably often proceeds from the glands at the cervix uteri, and not unfrequently from the lacunae of tho&s;e of the vagina; for many women &s;ub|ject to leucorrhoea have the di&s;charge nearly of the u&s;ual appearance and quantity during pregnancy, and it is more &s;eldom ob&s;erved to be periodical. Its co|lour and con&s;i&s;tence vary according to the nature and duration of the di&s;ea&s;e, the con&s;titution, &s;ea&s;on, cli|mate,
<PB N="112" REF="022551_0102_0FB94223B1F6B9C8">
and other circum&s;tances. It is probably mild and &s;erous when fir&s;t poured out; afterwards, by &s;tagnating, becomes more thick and acrid, varying al&s;o in colour and odour.</P>
<P>Few women, &s;omewhat advanced in life, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who have had children, who have been &s;ubject to mi&s;carriage, or irregularities of men&s;trua, are en|tirely free from it. The inactive and &s;edentary; full, jolly, or flabby women; and the relaxed and weakly; are e&s;pecially liable to it.</P>
<P>Pain and weakne&s;s of the back and loins, di&s;pep&s;ia, and the other &s;ymptoms of debility and indige&s;tion, &s;uppo&s;ed to be its almo&s;t con&s;tant attendants, only occur when the di&s;charge is exce&s;&s;ive or very long continued. From quantity, or acrimony, e&s;pecially in warm weather, in gro&s;s habits, or from neglect to keep the parts clean, painful excoriations are fre|quently occa&s;ioned: in that &s;tate it may be readily confounded with <HI>gonorrhoea.</HI></P>
<P>The cure mu&s;t be regulated by particular circum|&s;tances. Gro&s;s habits, and tho&s;e who have been ac|cu&s;tomed to full rich diet, with little excerci&s;e, re|quire frequent purging, along with a mild &s;pare diet and cooling regimen. In weakly relaxed con&s;ti|tutions, the indications are, To re&s;tore the tone and vigour of the &s;y&s;tem, by proper regimen; bark, mineral waters, with &s;teel and alum, and the cold bath.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="022551_0103_0FB94225336D2558">
In either ca&s;e, the parts &s;hould be kept clean by frequent cold bathing. Any gently a&s;tringent wa&s;h, after general evacuations, may be freely u&s;ed in the former ca&s;e: and in the latter, injections of alum-water, tinctura ro&s;arum, or bals. traumatic. in a very dilute &s;tate, or wa&s;hing the parts with a &s;ponge &s;oaked in the &s;typtic liquor, often &s;en&s;ibly dimini&s;h the di&s;charge; and, in recent ca&s;es, entirely remove it.</P>
<P>Gellies of hart&s;horn, or ichthyocolla, bals. capivi, and topical a&s;tringent injections and wa&s;hes, are the be&s;t palliatives.</P>
<P><HI>Leucorrhoea</HI> may be di&s;tingui&s;hed into <HI>local</HI> and <HI>ge|neral;</HI> a morbid affection of the parts, or a weakne&s;s of the &s;y&s;tem, In the former ca&s;e, a&s;tringent wa&s;hes or injections; in the latter, tonics, as bark or bitters, with lime-water, have the be&s;t effects.

Nothing farther is probably meant by it, than an increa&s;ed acrimony of the fluor albus, occa&s;ioning heat, pain, itching, and of con|&s;equence

irritation in the&s;e parts. The cure mu&s;t therefore be conducted nearly in the &s;ame manner as in the former di&s;ea&s;e: The parts &s;hould be con&s;tantly kept clean by frequent bathing, or injections; of the&s;e a dilute &s;olution of &s;acch. &s;aturni in ro&s;e-water has been generally found to prove the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;s|ful; a cooling regimen mu&s;t al&s;o be enjoined, and occa&s;ional cau&s;es counteracted. Sometimes the cen|tre of this irritation has been di&s;covered within the urethra, when the bougie has proved the cure.</P>
<P>STERILITY. From mo&s;t of the preceding com|plaints, and from various other di&s;ea&s;es incident to tho&s;e parts, the uterus may be unfit to receive or re|tain the male &s;eed; or the tubes may be too &s;hort, or may have lo&s;t their erective power: in the&s;e ca&s;es, no conception can take place. Or, either from uni|ver&s;al debility and relaxation, or a local one of the genital &s;y&s;tem, the tone and contractile power of the&s;e parts may be de&s;troyed, &s;o that the &s;emen is thrown off immediately <HI>po&s;t coitum;</HI> which will in like manner occa&s;ion &s;terility. The&s;e cau&s;es of bar|renne&s;s are obvious; for where the aperture of the vagina, or of the uterus was impervious, there is not one in&s;tance of conception to be found in the records of medicine. The &s;ame effects generally follow from imperforation of the tubes, or di&s;ea&s;ed o|varia.</P>
<P>There are, however, many other cau&s;es of &s;terility;
<PB N="115" REF="022551_0105_0FB9422B4A3284F8">
but the&s;e, while the manner of generation is a my|&s;tery, are beyond the power of phi&s;iological inve&s;ti|gation.&mdash;Hence medical treatment can only avail in ca&s;es ari&s;ing from univer&s;al and topical debility; in correcting irregularities of the men&s;trual flux, one of the mo&s;t common cau&s;es of barrenne&s;s; and in removing tumors, cicatrices, or con&s;trictions of the pa&s;&s;ages, by the art of &s;urgery.</P>

<P>THE changes introduced by conception, frequent|ly prove the &s;ource of di&s;orders which a&s;&s;ume a variety of appearance in different con&s;titutions, and at different periods of pregnancy. The&s;e complaints are &s;ometimes trouble&s;ome, but they &s;eldom injure the con&s;titution; their effects are generally tempora|ry, their appearance and duration vague and irre|gular.</P>

<P>The &s;ickne&s;s from breeding is &s;ometimes &s;o &s;evere as to re&s;emble &s;ea-&s;ickne&s;s, and it is often as little in our power to relieve it.

In many con&s;titutions, however, particular|ly in the young and healthy, a certain degree of ple|thoric di&s;po&s;ition, even in the more early periods of pregnancy, &s;eems to prevail; &s;mall bleedings, there|fore where the &s;ickne&s;s is attended with flu&s;hings, dry parched mouth and &s;auces, vertigo, or any other &s;ymtoms of fever, are &s;afe and beneficial, and often give all the relief in our power to afford. Although a ra&s;h, indi&s;criminate, or frequent u&s;e of venae&s;ection is to be guarded again&s;t as a hazardous expedient; on the contrary, if prudently employed, it may often be the means of preventing abortion. It may be &s;afely performed at any time of ge&s;tation, and repeated ac|cording to the urgency of the &s;ymtoms. But &s;mall bleedings are always to be preferred to copious eva|cuations; which, in every period of pregnancy, e&s;|pecially in the early months, when the hazard of mi&s;|carriage is greate&s;t, &s;hould be avoided.</P>

<P>THE di&s;orders which attend the advanced months of ge&s;tation, are more &s;udden in their occur|rence, more painful in their &s;ymptoms, and more dangerous in their con&s;equences, than tho&s;e of the early months.

<P>Previous to attempting the reduction of the uterus, the counteracting ob&s;tacles mu&s;t be removed. With this view, repeated venae&s;ection may be nece&s;&s;ary; fomentations, or the &s;emicupium, &s;hould be u&s;ed to dimini&s;h &s;welling and inflammation; the catheter &s;hould be pa&s;&s;ed to evacuate the urine; and the rec|tum &s;hould be wa&s;hed out with repeated gly&s;ters.</P>
<P>The reduction of the uterine tumor &s;hould then be attempted, by placing the patient on her knees and arms, with her head reclined and properly &s;upported, endeavouring, by every po&s;&s;ible means, to re&s;tore the uterus to its proper po&s;ition. The force employed &s;hould be gentle at fir&s;t, pre&s;&s;ing backwards and up|wards in different directions, (to draw the os tincae down from the pubes), not by &s;tarts, but con&s;tantly

and equally, gradually increa&s;ing the exertions of force, as far as they can &s;afely be carried, till the end in view be obtained.</P>
<P>After the reduction the patient mu&s;t be confined mo&s;tly to bed, and the di&s;tention of the bladder and rectum mu&s;t be carefully prevented, till the uterus ri&s;es above the brim of the pelvis, when &s;he will be &s;ecured from future danger. But if the ob&s;tinacy of the di&s;ea&s;e &s;hould render every effort ineffectual ei|ther to evacuate the urine or replace the uterus, it has been propo&s;ed to puncture the bladder at the pubes; and, if that &s;hould fail to facilitate the reduction, to thru&s;t a trocar into the &s;ub&s;tance of the uterus to pro|cure abortion; or to enlarge the pelvis by inci&s;ion at the &s;ymphy&s;is pubes, in order to accompli&s;h the re|duction of the uterus.&mdash;The two fir&s;t propo&s;als are &s;hocking and de&s;perate: the la&s;t gives a more rea&s;on|able pro&s;pect of &s;aving both the mother and child.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION III. Some ordinary Di&s;ea&s;es which require peculiar treatment when they occur during Pregnancy.</HEAD>
<P>BESIDES tho&s;e hitherto enumerated as more im|mediately deriving their origin from pregnancy, other di&s;orders &s;ometimes occur, which may then require &s;ome variety from the u&s;ual management. The&s;e are chiefly, paraly&s;is, nephritis and calculi, herniae, drop&s;y, leucorrhoea, venereal complaints, fevers.</P>
<P>PARALYSIS is generally local, and chiefly confined to the lower extremities, or may be traced by the cour&s;e of the nerves to depend on the pre&s;&s;ure of the uterus. The treatment can only be directed with a view to palliate till delivery. Gentle exerci&s;e, mo|derate evacuations when the habit is full, otherwi&s;e &s;trengthening diet and regimen, with warm applica|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ions and friction, are the principal remedies.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="022551_0126_0FB9425CA71497C8">
NEPHRITIS and CALCULI. The former mu&s;t be palliated by venae&s;ection, diluent drinks, opiates. If the calculus &s;ticks in the urethra, and the woman is near her time, it &s;hould, if po&s;&s;ible, be pu&s;hed back into the bladder with the catheter: other|wi&s;e, when ea&s;ily come at, the &s;tone may be cut upon and extracted.</P>
<P>HERNIAE. Some of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e are cured by pregnancy; others continue during the whole term of ge&s;tation. Bandages can &s;eldom be u&s;ed with &s;afety in the pregnant &s;tate; at lea&s;t tight pre&s;&s;ure by the com|mon umbilical bandage mu&s;t be avoided. In time of labour, they mu&s;t be carefully &s;upported with the hand during a pain; after delivery, future inflam|mation and its con&s;equences mu&s;t be guarded again&s;t; the u&s;ual bandage mu&s;t again be applied, when the patient is &s;ufficiently recovered to be able to &s;tay any time out of bed after delivery.</P>
<P>The HYDROPS ASCITES&mdash;in pregnant women, &s;ometimes al&s;o occurs; and will, during that &s;tate, only admit of palliation. The belly mu&s;t be kept open; the evacuation of urine, as much as po&s;&s;ible, mu&s;t be promoted, by cream of tartar, dried &s;quills, and the like; and gentle exerci&s;e mu&s;t be u&s;ed. If, however, the abdomen be much di&s;tended, the re&s;|piration difficult, and other &s;ymptoms urgent, the water may be &s;afely drawn off by the operation of the paracente&s;is.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="022551_0127_0FB9426399CFBA20">
THE FLUOR ALBUS or LEUCORRHOEA&mdash;is &s;ometimes cured, &s;ometimes increa&s;ed, by ge&s;tation. Except the little variety which an attention to the gravid &s;tate requires, the cure is the &s;ame as at other times.</P>
<P>GONORRHOEA and LUES VENEREA.&mdash;The cure of the former is to be conducted inpretty much the u&s;ual manner; that is, by keeping the parts clean by frequent bathing by drinking freely of di|luent drinks, by an open belly and cooling diet.

<P>In the confirmed lues, we can only, in general, propo&s;e to &s;top the progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e, or palliate the &s;everity of the &s;ymptoms.

FEVERS.&mdash;Women are le&s;s &s;ubject to febrile di&s;|orders during pregnancy than at other times. There is, however, an univer&s;al heat all over the body; which with &s;ome is a &s;ymptom of conception, and with others continues during the whole term, that hardly de&s;erves that name.</P>
<P>The limits of the pre&s;ent work neither admit of of our entering into any di&s;qui&s;ition on the nature of fever in general; or the treatment of the variety of &s;pecies.

<P>ABORTION, and its common attendant FLOOD|ING, are neither confined to the early nor latter months; but happen indi&s;criminately to every peri|od of ge&s;tation. The one is a frequent con&s;equence of the other, and the event is often hazardous. In the earlier months, when the child has little life, a con|&s;iderable di&s;charge of blood frequently precedes the expul&s;ion of the ovum; and, in the latter &s;tages, the effu&s;ion is &s;ometimes &s;o exce&s;&s;ive as to endanger the mother's life.</P>

Floodings &s;eldom prove fatal to the mother before the &s;eventh month of ge&s;tation, but are afterwards proportionally more alarming and dangerous. In the early months, there is always hazard of the lo&s;s of the foetus, even from an incon&s;iderable di&s;charge; and from the increa&s;ed diameter of the blood-ve&s;&s;els in the more advanced periods, the di&s;charge is often fatal to the parent.</P>
<P>To check the haemorrhagy, the indications are,
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. To dimini&s;h plethora, as well as the impetus of the heart and arteries.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. To re&s;tore a more equable circulation in the whole &s;y&s;tem.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. To re&s;tore the tone of the &s;olids, and pro|mote the con&s;triction of the ve&s;&s;els.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. To an&s;wer the fir&s;t intention, venae&s;ection, a free circulation of cool air, coolling diet, drink, and other refrigerants, are the principal remedies.</P>
<P N="2">2. The &s;econd indication is with difficulty fol|lowed; for the exertion which the &s;everal remedies that produce this effect occa&s;ion, will be often very hurtful.</P>
<P>Vomiting and purging, except with the mo&s;t cool|ing neutrals, are &s;eldom admi&s;&s;ible; and warmth, applied to the &s;urface, is equivocal in its effects. The only means, therefore, which we can recom|mend with this view, is to keep the feet warm with flannels and gentle friction, and the body and mind
<PB N="141" REF="022551_0131_0FB9426BA95B43D8">
in the mo&s;t perfect tranquillity. Opium, in the form of of Dover's powder, is al&s;o frequently effectual in ren|dering the circulating more uniform and equable. Might not the opium and ipecacuan only, be kept mixed, and the powder given in tho&s;e ca&s;es, in fre&s;h &s;olution of nitre, in a full do&s;e? Such a for|mula would probably be a powerful remedy for hae|morrhagies of all kinds.</P>
<P>Some of the cau&s;es which we have mentioned are evidently beyond our reach. The&s;e indications are, however, chiefly u&s;eful in the early &s;tages: the eva|cuation it&s;elf &s;oon takes off plethora, as well as the haemorrhagic effort of the heart and arteries; &s;o that the chief bu&s;ine&s;s of the practitioner is,</P>
<P N="3">3. To re&s;tore the tone of the &s;olids, and promote the con&s;triction of the ve&s;&s;els. With this view, in|ternal a&s;tringents, and the application of cold, are the mo&s;t effectual means. The &s;typtics generally employed are, the vitriolic acid, alum, terra Japo|nica, and gum kino: but cold applications to the pudendum and neighbouring parts are chiefly to be tru&s;ted; as thick linen compre&s;&s;es wet with cold vi|negar and water, applied to the os externum, pubes, and loins, and often renewed le&s;t they &s;hould become warm. A bladder with cold water, in which &s;ome crude &s;al ammoniac is di&s;&s;olved, may be u&s;ed for a topical application, and will retain the cold fluid lon|ger than any other compre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="022551_0132_0FB9426D2DC5E540">
By thus keeping the patient quiet and cool, by gi|ving internally cooling things and opiates, and by the application of cold to the organ affected, the haemor|rhagy may be re&s;trained, tho' threatening and alarm|ing; and the woman, after &s;everal attacks, may, under proper management, be enabled to carry the child to the full term of delivery.</P>
<P>Debility and relaxation mu&s;t afterwards be remo|ved, by nouri&s;hing diet and tonic remedies; and, in relaxed habits, the hazard of relap&s;e guarded again&s;t by the u&s;e of the Peruvian bark, moderate exerci&s;e, and the other remedies u&s;ually employed after ca&s;es of profu&s;e menorrhagia. In full habits, or where there is an evident di&s;po&s;ition to plethora, gentle eva|cuations, cooling regimen, and an ab&s;temious &s;pare diet, are the be&s;t prophylactics.</P>
<P>In the latter end of pregnancy, when the haemor|rhagy proceeds from the &s;eparation of a portion of the cake which adhered at the cervix, over the orifi|cium uteri, the deluge is &s;ometimes &s;o impetuous as to kill the mother very &s;uddenly. The only method, then, in our power, for pre&s;erving both the parent and child, is by an <HI>expeditious delivery;</HI> I mean expe|ditious with re&s;pect to the time it is attempted, for the operation of delivery &s;hould be &s;lowly perfor|med.</P>
<P>In all ca&s;es of flooding, when any portion of the pappy &s;ub&s;tance of placenta can be felt by the finger

<HEAD>II. ABORTION.</HEAD>
<P>ABORTION is, "The premature delivery of the foetus;" which comprehends every period before the evolution of its &s;y&s;tem be &s;ufficiently complete to enable the child to exi&s;t after the connection with the parent is di&s;&s;olved.</P>
<P>Some authors &s;till make the following di&s;tinction. When the ovum is expelled in the early months, they call it an <HI>abortion;</HI> and, if the foetus be delive|red at any period between the fifth month and the full time, a <HI>mi&s;carriage.</HI></P>
<P>Abortion is commonly preceded by &s;ome of the following &s;ymptoms: Flooding, pains in the back or belly, uterine bearing-down pains with regular in|termi&s;&s;ions, the di&s;charge of a watery fluid.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="022551_0134_0FB94271AC98FE00">
If, along with flooding, any portion of a va&s;cular &s;kinny &s;ub&s;tance, which is the membrana dicidua, &s;hould be di&s;charged, abortion for certain will en&s;ue. None of the other &s;ymptoms are infallible; even the evacuation of a watery fluid is not nece&s;&s;arily follow|ed with delivery, &s;ince it may proceed from a col|lection on the out&s;ide of the ovum, between the lamellae of the membranes. In the early months exce&s;&s;ive floodings &s;ometimes occur; and yet, by proper management, the woman is often enabled to retain the child.</P>
<P>There is le&s;s fear of abortion while the blood eva|cuated is pure and without clots, unattended with uterine pain and pre&s;&s;ure. But, in forming a judg|ment, the con&s;titution, occa&s;ional cau&s;e, and term of ge&s;tation, mu&s;t be regarded.</P>
<P>Abortions happen more frequently from the be|ginning of the &s;econd to the end of the third month, that at any other period.</P>
<P>The immediate cau&s;e of abortion is the &s;ame with that of real labour.</P>
<P>The more remote cau&s;es are,</P>
<P>I. Whatever interrupts the regular circulation be|tween the uterus and placenta; as,</P>
<P N="1">1. Di&s;ea&s;es of the uterus.</P>
<P N="2">2. Imperviou&s;ne&s;s, or &s;pa&s;modic con&s;triction, of the extremities of the uterine blood-ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P N="3">3. The &s;eparation of any portion of the cake, or
<PB N="145" REF="022551_0135_0FB942776101B8E8">
decidua, from the uterus.</P>
<P N="4">4. Determination of the fluids to other parts.</P>
<P>II. Every cau&s;e which prevents the di&s;tention of the uterus, or excites &s;pa&s;modic contraction of its mu&s;cular fibres; as,</P>
<P N="1">1. Extreme irritability, preventing the exten&s;ion of that organ.</P>
<P N="2">2. Violent exertions, as coughing, &s;neezing, vo|miting, &s;training at &s;tool: mechanical injuries, as &s;trains, falls, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="3">3. Irritation from the confined motion of the foetus, its kicking or &s;trugglings.</P>
<P N="4">4. A habitual di&s;po&s;ition to abortion.</P>
<P>III. The death of the foetus; which many be occa|&s;ioned from,</P>
<P N="1">1. Di&s;ea&s;es peculiar to it&s;elf.</P>
<P N="2">2. An original defect tran&s;mitted from the pa|rents.</P>
<P N="3">3. External accidents affecting the mother.</P>
<P N="4">4. di&s;ea&s;es of the placenta, membranes, or cord.</P>
<P N="5">5. Too &s;light adhe&s;ion of the cake or membranes to the uterus.</P>
<P N="6">6. Weakne&s;s, or want of re&s;i&s;tance, in the tex|ture of the membranes; or an exce&s;&s;ive quantity of the liquor amnii.</P>
<P N="7">7. Knotty circumvolutions of the umbilical cord.</P>
<P>The &s;ize of the obortive ovum in early ge&s;tation is as follows: Six weeks after conception, its bulk is
<PB N="146" REF="022551_0136_0FB9427C964B36E0">
nearly equal to a pigeon's egg; in eight weeks, to that of a hen; and in twelve to that of a goo&s;e.</P>
<P>Where there is no rea&s;on to dread abortion, every probable mean ought to be employed to relieve pain|ful &s;ymptoms by re&s;t and opiates, to check haemor|rhagy by the means already directed, and to obviate occa&s;ional cau&s;es as much as po&s;&s;ible; and the wo|man &s;hould be encouraged to hope as long as there is grounds for it.</P>
<P>As abortion, in many in&s;tances, is preceded by no alarming &s;ymptom, till a di&s;charge of watery fluid, or an exce&s;&s;ive flooding, with clots and portions of the decidua, announce the approaching event; either to remove immediate &s;ymptoms, or prevent the accident that is dreaded, often baffles our boa&s;ted &s;kill; for the circulation in the ovum perhaps had cea&s;ed a con&s;iderable time previous to any threatening &s;ymp|tom of its expul&s;ion.</P>
<P>Little, therefore, can or ought to be done by way of treatment, be&s;ides obviating plethora, advi&s;ing re&s;t of body and tranquillity of mind, and guarding again&s;t every cau&s;e of irritation. Though the mo|ther may &s;uffer a con&s;iderable &s;hock from mi&s;carriage, and it may be &s;ome time before her con&s;titution be &s;ufficiently re&s;tored for any future fortunate preg|nancy, women are rarely known to &s;uffer fatally, but from mi&s;management in the early months. Any manual operation to a&s;&s;i&s;t delivery, is &s;eldom nece&s;&s;ary
<PB N="147" REF="022551_0137_0FB942847591A368">
at an earlier period than the &s;ixth month of ge&s;tation, unle&s;s the mother's life &s;hould be in danger from flooding. When this happens, the bag may be bro|ken by thru&s;ting the finger again&s;t it in time of pain, or endeavouring to a&s;&s;i&s;t its expul&s;ion when within reach of the finger; but otherwi&s;e the delivery &s;hould be <HI>wholly</HI> tru&s;ted to nature. It is even hazardous to de&s;troy the &s;tructure of the ovum in the early months: for when it breaks, the &s;mall foetus is fir&s;t expelled; and the bag or placenta may be afterwards retained for a week or more, during which time the flooding often continues to be exce&s;&s;ive; whereas, if the conception comes off entire, the effu&s;ion ge|nerally cea&s;es immediately.</P>
<P>From long retention, the placenta, without cir|culation, is liable to become putrid: it is then expel|led in different portions; and inflammation, excori|ation, or gangrene of the uterus and vagina, often en&s;ues. In the&s;e circum&s;tances there is a nece&s;&s;ity for keeping the parts clean, by frequent bathing, or by injections thrown into the vagina; and bark, with elixir of vitriol, &s;hould be given freely. Gently &s;timulating gly&s;ters, to promote the contraction of the uterus, in ca&s;es of retention of the placenta where there is no great flooding, are often u&s;eful.</P>
<P>As women who have once aborted are liable to a repetition of that accident from a &s;imilar or very tri|fling occa&s;ional cau&s;e, it ought to be guarded again&s;t
<PB N="148" REF="022551_0138_0FB94289A8D216A8">
by every po&s;&s;ible means. With this view, the ma|nagement during pregnancy &s;hould be properly regu|lated.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION V. Management during Pregnancy.</HEAD>
<P>THE regulations during pregnancy may be refer|red to the following rules.</P>
<P N="1">1. The &s;tricte&s;t temperance and regularity in diet, &s;leeping, exerci&s;e, and amu&s;ement, are nece&s;&s;ary to be ob&s;erved by tho&s;e who have rea&s;on to dread abortions.</P>
<P N="2">2. Overheating, irregular pa&s;&s;ions, and co&s;tivene&s;s, &s;hould be con&s;tantly guarded again&s;t.</P>
<P N="3">3. The hazard of &s;hocks, from falls in walking or riding, from brui&s;es in crowds, of frights from bu&s;tle, &s;hould be avoided with the utmo&s;t circum&s;pec|tion.</P>
<P N="4">4. The dre&s;s of pregnant women ought to be loo&s;e and ea&s;y. Tight lacing is injurious at every period of ge&s;tation. In the early months, by pre|venting the uterus from ri&s;ing out of the pelvis, it endangers mi&s;carriage, and is &s;till more hazardous in the advanced &s;tages. Jumps, without knots, buck|les, or whale-bone, &s;ecured with &s;traps of broad tape or ribbon, &s;hould be had recour&s;e to &s;oon after con|ception, and worn con&s;tantly.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="149" REF="022551_0139_0FB9428B9D70F8D8">
5. Pregnant women require free, pure air; their inclinations &s;hould be gratified by every rea&s;onable indulgence; and their &s;pirits kept up by cheerful company and variety of objects, that their minds may be always compo&s;ed and happy.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; 1. General Ob&s;ervations.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the uterus will admit of no greater di&s;tention, without a material, or probably fatal di&s;order, from its impeding the &s;everal functions, labour en&s;ues.</P>
<P>At this period, the organization of the foetus is &s;ufficiently evolved to enable it to continue its exi&s;t|ence; for as it derives no injury from a longer de|lay, &s;o it can &s;urvive a &s;light acceleration of this im|portant change.</P>
<P>The period of ge&s;tation varies in the &s;everal cla&s;&s;es of different animals. The mare, the cow, the ewe, and the goat, are re&s;tricted, each within its proper limits. In the human &s;pecies, nine kalender months &s;eem nece&s;&s;ary for the perfection of the foetus; that is, nearly 39 weeks, or 273 days, from conception. The term does not, however, appear to be &s;o ar|bitrarily e&s;tabli&s;hed, but that Nature may tran&s;|gre&s;s

her u&s;ual laws; and, as many circum&s;tances frequently concur to anticipate delivery, it certainly may in &s;ome in&s;tances be protracted. Individuals of the &s;ame cla&s;s of quadrupeds, it is well known, va|ry in their periods of pregnancy. May we not from analogy, rea&s;onably infer, that women &s;ometimes exceed the more ordinary period? In &s;everal to|lerably well atte&s;ted ca&s;es, the birth appears to have been protracted &s;everal weeks beyond the common term of delivery. If the character of the woman be unexceptionable, a favourable report may be given for the mother, though the child &s;hould not be pro|duced till nearly ten kalendar months after the ab|&s;ence or &s;udden death of her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>LABOUR is <Q>an effort of nature to expel the con|tents of the gravid uterus.</Q> It is chiefly accom|pli&s;hed by the &s;pa&s;modic contraction of the uterus it&s;elf. The diaphragm, mu&s;cles of the abdomen, and others concerned in re&s;piration, and all the mu&s;|cles of the body, are called in as auxiliary powers. The&s;e efforts alternate with intervals of ea&s;e; and the exertions, or parox<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">s, continue till the child is propelled, and the uterus completely emptied of its contents.</P>
<P>The <HI>immediate cau&s;e of labour</HI> &s;eems to be, <Q>Irrita|tion, from previous di&s;tention of the uterus, com|pre&s;&s;ing the foetus and waters.</Q> The uterine con|tents
<PB N="152" REF="022551_0142_0FB942936D3C46C8">
being propelled again&s;t the orifice, the mu&s;|cular &s;tructure of that organ will be &s;timulated into action, and labour-pains con&s;equently en&s;ue.</P>
<P>The <HI>final cau&s;e</HI> of labour is, the birth of the child.</P>
<P><HI>Spurious pains</HI> frequently occur towards the latter end of ge&s;tation. Their cau&s;es are a &s;light degree of irritation of the uterus from exce&s;&s;ive &s;tretching; &s;pa&s;modic affections of the abdominal vi&s;cera; or, any &s;timulus communicated from the inte&s;tinal canal, as colic from co&s;tivene&s;s and other cau&s;es. They of|ten nearly re&s;emble labour, and ought to be carefully di&s;tingui&s;hed from it.</P>
<P>They are more vague and irregular, both in fre|quency and force, than tho&s;e ari&s;ing from genuine labour; they do not produce any &s;en&s;ible change on the orificium uteri; they are not attended with any con&s;iderable di&s;charge of the ropy mucus, which &s;ometimes precedes, and always accompanies, the fir&s;t &s;tage of real labour. They are generally con|fined to the lumbar region, or to the belly, without &s;triking down the thighs; they are commonly mo&s;t trouble&s;ome towards evening occa&s;ion inquietude and re&s;tle&s;sne&s;s in the night, and abate in the morning. They are further known to be &s;purious, by the re|lief procured from gly&s;ters and opiates.</P>
<P><HI>Genuine labour</HI> is known to approach from the cir|cum&s;tances which u&s;ually precede it: the progre&s;s is
<PB N="153" REF="022551_0143_0FB9429896E09CF8">
marked by the duration, force, and frequency of the pains; by their effects on the general &s;y&s;tem; more particularly by the dilatation of the uterine orifice, and protru&s;ion of the water and child.</P>
<P>The <HI>&s;ymptoms of approaching labour</HI> are, the &s;ub&s;i|ding of the abdominal tumor at the &s;uperior part; hence, at fir&s;t, a relief from weight, pre&s;&s;ure, and unea&s;ine&s;s formerly felt; afterwards, a di&s;charge of ropy mucus from the vagina, &s;ometimes tinged or &s;treaked with blood, commonly &s;tyled the <HI>&s;hews;</HI> then, &s;light pains of the belly or loins, frequent mic|turition, ten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;mus, &s;ometimes colic or diarrhoea, extreme re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, alternate rigours and hot fits.</P>
<P>The throes of labour u&s;ually commence with pain in the region of the loins, which &s;pread round for|wards and downwards, and again extend from the belly to the pubes, &s;hooting down the thighs. At fir&s;t they are vague, more &s;light and tran&s;itory; but gradually increa&s;e in force, and recur at more regu|lar intervals.</P>
<P>Sickne&s;s of the &s;tomach, retching, and vomiting, alternate rigours and hot fits, in &s;ome in&s;tances ac|company the earlie&s;t &s;ymptoms of labour; in others, horripulatio occurs in the progre&s;s, and &s;eems then to be occa&s;ioned by the pre&s;&s;ure of the head of the foetus again&s;t the irritable uterine orifice.</P>
<P>Pyrexia, in young plethoric women, is a frequent attendant of labour; for, with increa&s;ed pain, the face becomes flu&s;hed, the pul&s;e full, &s;trong and ac|celerated,
<PB N="154" REF="022551_0144_0FB942996D0F3B88">
along with dry parched mouth and fauces, and the other &s;ymptoms of fever, &s;tyled by authors <HI>febris parturiens.</HI> I&s;churia, or &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of urine, and &s;ometimes an involuntary di&s;charge of faeces, en&s;ue.</P>
<P>The <HI>progre&s;s of labour</HI> generally proceeds in the fol|owing manner.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence the great di&s;charge of lubricating moi&s;ture, the genital parts are fir&s;t relaxed, and then gradually begin to dilate. The membranes al&s;o gra|dually &s;eparate from the internal &s;urface of the uterus; and, by its &s;pa&s;modic contractions, the membranes and contained water is protruded in form of a &s;oft, yielding bag, before the pre&s;enting part of the child. In the ab&s;ence of the pain, the waters retreat; the membranous bag is relaxed, or flaccid; and the child, if within reach, can be di&s;tinctly felt through. When the pain recurs, the membranes become ten&s;e and turgid; &s;pread out more and more; and, advancing lower and lower as the pains increa&s;e in force and fre|quency, they gently and &s;afely &s;tretch and dilate the the pa&s;&s;ages preparatory to delivery, in a manner which no human artifice can po&s;&s;ibly imitate. When that important end is accompli&s;hed, the &s;lender bag yeilding to the propelling force, gives way, and the contained fluid is evacuated.</P>
<P>In a natural ea&s;y labour, the progre&s;s of the head of the foetus through the pelvis corre&s;ponds with the
<PB N="155" REF="022551_0145_0FB9429B11C0D490">
protru&s;ion of the membranes and dilation of the &s;oft parts. The head advances in a mechanical manner, its large axis being generally applied to that of the pelvis. When the vertex is nearly arrived at the lower circumference of the bony cavity, the membranes give way; &s;oon after which, the pains are renewed with increa&s;ed force. The vertex advances through the axis of the vagina; the occiput gradually emer|ges from under the arch of the pubes; and the &s;oft parts at the bottom of the pelvis beginning to be pro|truded in a form of a tumour, the os externum is radually dilated. As the occiput ri&s;es from below the pubes, the face is turned towards the concavity of the &s;acrum; the forehead pre&s;&s;es again&s;t the moveable coccyx; the vertex now protruding without the os externum and the &s;timulating exertions becoming &s;o exce&s;&s;ive as to throw the whole frame into the mo&s;t violent agitation, the os externum is forced open, and the head of the child propelled. After &s;ome interval of ea&s;e, the pain, in a more moderate degree, recurs, and continues till the child is completely delivered, the &s;houlders making the &s;ame mechanical turns with the head.</P>
<P>When the woman has &s;omewhat recovered the &s;hock, the uterus again renews its contractions; and by a more gentle and moderate exertion of the &s;ame power by which the membranes were &s;eparated and protruded and the child was propelled, the pla|centa
<PB N="156" REF="022551_0146_0FB9429C6B20BDB0">
is detached from its adhen&s;ion to the womb, forced downwards to the orifice, and expelled.</P>
<P>This is the manner and progre&s;s of natural ea&s;y la|bour. But a variety of circum&s;tances frequently con|cur to di&s;appoint our hopes, and render the birth te|dious and painful. The original po&s;ition of the foe|tus <HI>in utero;</HI> the bulk, &s;hape and &s;olidity of the head; the age, con&s;titution, and previous condition, as well as pre&s;ent health and management of the patient; the action of the uterus it&s;elf, con&s;idered as a hollow mu&s;|cle; the rigidity of the os tincae; the con&s;truction and capacity of the pelvis; the texture of the mem|branes; the tightne&s;s or con&s;triction of the vagina; the re&s;i&s;tance of the os externum, &amp;c. occa&s;ion an a&s;toni&s;hing variety in the degree of pain, the pro|gre&s;s or duration, and manner of termination of la|bour. Practitioners &s;hould therefore be cautious of giving an opinion re&s;pecting the time of delivery, at lea&s;t till the progre&s;s be con&s;iderably advanced.</P>
<P>A judgment of the duration and event of labour is chiefly to be derived from the force, continuance, and recurrence of pains; from the re&s;i&s;tance of the os tincae, or the contrary; from the period when the membranous bag is ruptured; from the po&s;ition of the child's head, and relative proportions that ob|tain between it and the pelvis.</P>
<P>Young women, apparently well proportioned of
<PB N="157" REF="022551_0147_0FB9429DECAD5120">
a lax fibre and healthy con&s;titution, may be pre&s;umed to have ea&s;y, favourable labours. We may expect the delivery to be tolerably ea&s;y and expeditious, when the pains come on regularly; when the child pre&s;ents properly; when the membranes begin early to form a bag, and protrude the os tincae; when it is thin, &s;oft, and yielding, and is felt by the touch to dilate &s;en|&s;ibly by the force of the pains; when the head can be felt thro' the membranes during the remi&s;&s;ion of pain, advances progre&s;&s;ively through the pelvis, preceded by the amnion tumor and the rupture of the mem|branes, when the head can be felt to pre&s;s again&s;t the orificium uteri.</P>
<P>But, even in tho&s;e circum&s;tances, the progre&s;s of labour is often unexpectedly interrupted, by the remi&s;&s;ion or dimini&s;hed force of pains for a con&s;idera|ble interval; by the con&s;triction of the vagina after the os tincae is completely dilated; or, by the rigidi|ty of the external parts, though no ob&s;tacle &s;hould occur from any defect in the con&s;truction of the pelvis.</P>
<P>In &s;ome in&s;tances, the progre&s;s is retarded by the early rupture of the membranes, &s;low dilatation of the os tincae, feeblene&s;s of the throes, and a variety of other cau&s;es. Nothing can therefore be more dif|ficult, than to a&s;certain, or gue&s;s at, the time nece&s;|&s;ary to accompli&s;h the wi&s;hed-for event. The more ordinary limits of a natural ea&s;y labour are from &s;ix
<PB N="158" REF="022551_0148_0FB9429F76D47FC0">
to twelve hours; it is&punc; however, &s;ometimes com|pleted within two hours, and &s;ometimes requires &s;e|veral days. But the fir&s;t labour is generally, from obvious cau&s;es, the mo&s;t painful and tedious.</P>
</DIV4>

<HEAD>&sect; 2. Divi&s;ion of Labours.</HEAD>
<P>THE ancients, as far as can be collected from their writings, divided labours into two kinds, Natural, and Preternatural. The fir&s;t included head, or, according to &s;ome, head and breech, pre&s;enta|tions; and all others were implied in the latter. Dead children &s;eem to make a third di&s;tinction, and are directed to be delivered in a particular manner by &s;harp hooks.</P>
<P>In different authors we find different arrangements, and the cla&s;&s;ification is &s;till arbitrary. That of Dr SMELLIE appears to be lea&s;t liable to exception. He refers all labours to three general cla&s;&s;es: 1<HI>&s;t.</HI> Natu|ral; 2<HI>dly,</HI> Laborious; and, 3<HI>dly,</HI> Preternatural. He calls tho&s;e ca&s;es <HI>natural,</HI> where the head pre&s;ents, and the child is expelled by the natural pains; <HI>labori|ous,</HI> when the head pre&s;ents, but the birth is uncom|monly protracted, or requires the interpo&s;ition of art; and <HI>preternatural,</HI> when any other part but the head fir&s;t pre&s;ents, or when the feet are delivered before &s;he head.</P>
<P>A great variety of divi&s;ions and &s;ubdivi&s;ions, how|ever,

<P>All di&s;tinctions ought to be re&s;tricted to tho&s;e ca&s;es merely which require a different mode of practice.

<HEAD>FIRST STAGE. DILATATION of the ORIFICIUM UTERI.</HEAD>
<P>ON the commencement of labour, and previous to any attempt to a&s;&s;i&s;t it, the nece&s;&s;ary ap|paratus &s;hould be prepared. The room &s;hould be lofty, the bed equally di&s;tant from a confined &s;itua|tion, and a current of air; the curtains, and every part of the furniture, &s;hould be thin and incapable of retaining either moi&s;ture or &s;mell. The coverings of the &s;heets &s;hould be carefully adapted to prevent the blood or the waters, from penetrating through them.</P>
<P>The patient &s;hould be permitted to walk, or re&s;t in her u&s;ual po&s;tures, till the os uteri is dilated, and the pains be frequent and pre&s;&s;ing: &s;he &s;hould then be placed on her &s;ide, with her knees drawn up; and, in advanced labour, they may be &s;eparated by
<PB N="162" REF="022551_0152_0FB942B2E04A1918">
a pillow, and a re&s;i&s;tance given to the feet by an a&s;&s;i&s;tant. Before &s;he is placed in this po&s;ition, every indelicacy, by frequent touching, is highly improper. It is afterwards more e&s;&s;ential, and &s;hould never be neglected immediately after the rupture of the mem|branes; for the child's arm, or any portion of the umbilical cord which may threaten to pre&s;ent, may then be replaced with ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Having obviated every cau&s;e which may impede labour, and guarded again&s;t every thing which may di&s;turb or irritate the patient, we &s;hould wait with patience till nature has protruded the head of the child, or the membranes filled with their fluid. If we inter|po&s;e before, it &s;hould only be to apply a warm cloth to the os externum, or a pre&s;&s;ure to the loins, if the pains are violent.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;tage of labour is then accompli&s;hed.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5 N="2" TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>SECOND STAGE. DELIVERY of the CHILD.</HEAD>
<P>IF the membranes have not been before ruptured, it &s;hould now be done by the finger of the Accou|cheur; and a remi&s;&s;ion of pain generally en&s;ues. It returns, however, as &s;oon as the watery fluid is di&s;charged; and the perinaeum is &s;oon after di&s;ten|ded by the pre&s;&s;ure of the vertex: but, under proper
<PB N="163" REF="022551_0153_0FB942BAA1B12EE0">
management, no bad con&s;equences follow from the di&s;tention, unle&s;s the labour is rapid or tedious. In the former ca&s;e, the parts of the mother have been lacerated; and, in the latter, violently in|flamed, in con&s;equence of the long-continued pre&s;|&s;ure of the child's head.</P>
<P>When the parts are violently &s;tretched, the peri|naeum may be gently &s;upported during a pain, and a counter-pre&s;&s;ure is generally recommended when the labour is rapid; but it &s;hould be remembered, that this &s;upport is only u&s;eful as it retards the labour, which is often inconvenient, and &s;ometimes dangerous. A laceration of the perinaeum is a very rare occur|rence, and generally the con&s;equence of previous di&s;ea&s;e. It is therefore doubtful, how far a hazar|dous expedient is to be recommended to obviate an uncertain accident.</P>
<P>After the head is delivered, there is &s;eldom any danger: the &s;houlders accommodate them&s;elves to the pa&s;&s;age; and the birth may then be &s;afely faci|litated by the hands of the Operator, if any a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;hould happen to be nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The child &s;hould be immediately removed, as far as the cord will permit; if it is twi&s;ted about the neck, body, or limbs, it mu&s;t be di&s;engaged, and, after the child has &s;hown &s;igns of life, the cord mu&s;t be tied.

<HEAD>THIRD STAGE; OR Separation and expul&s;ion of the PLACENTA and SECUNDINES. MANAGEMENT OF THE PLACENTA.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING given the child to the nur&s;e or one of the attendants, the next object of our regard is, the Management of the Placenta.</P>
<P>The &s;ame powers which expel the foetus, are again, after a &s;hort interval, renewed, but in a le&s;&s;er degree, to exlude the &s;ecundines. Their &s;tructure is, however, different from the more &s;olid ma&s;s of the foetus. The uterus &s;ometimes contracts unequally; the os tincae is more irritable than the fundus; and the mu&s;cular fibres round the edge of the orifice &s;ometimes contract &s;o quickly, that the aperture &s;oon dimini&s;hes, and may for a little time prevent the cake from pa&s;&s;ing after its adhe&s;ion to the uterus is di&s;&s;olved. From the unequal or partial contraction of the mu&s;cular fibres of the uterus where the pla|centa
<PB N="165" REF="022551_0155_0FB942C091D809F8">
is attached, one portion may be &s;eparated be|fore another: all which render a variety of mana|gement, in peculiar circum&s;tances, nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Hence the oppo&s;ition of &s;entiment of authors on the &s;ubject; &s;ome recommending as a general rule, to precipitate the extraction immediately after the delivery of the child, le&s;t the uterus &s;uddenly clo|&s;ing, &s;hould render the operation difficult and hazar|dous; while others advi&s;e, in all ca&s;es, to tru&s;t the management entirely to nature.</P>
<P>The middle cour&s;e is, in general, the mo&s;t &s;afe and proper; and both extremes &s;hould be equally guarded again&s;t.</P>

exertions moderately by bringing a deep in&s;piration and bearing down gently; but, violent efforts of coughing, retching, &s;neezing, or &s;training, &s;hould be con&s;tantly avoided, le&s;t dangerous floodings or deliquia might follow. It is known to advance, by the lengthening of the cord, and the &s;training of the wo|man. When the bulky part of the ma&s;s arrives at the os tincae, the inverted cake, pre&s;&s;ing again&s;t the orifice in a globular form, &s;ometimes gives con&s;i|derable re&s;i&s;tance. This ob&s;tacle may be removed, either by pa&s;&s;ing up two fingers of the right-hand, guided by the cord, to bringdown the edge; or by waiting a few minutes, then pulling gently at the cord with the left-hand, and pre&s;&s;ing on the &s;ub&s;tance of the cake with the fingers of the right, higher and higher till the edge can be brought down, which mu&s;t be gra&s;ped firmly, the funis being &s;till extended with the other hand. The whole &s;ub&s;tance of the cake, with the membranes, being at la&s;t entirely di&s;|engaged, are to be gradually extracted, put into a ba&s;on, and removed.</P>
<P>But, if the placenta does not advance when the cord is fully extended, and the woman &s;uffers con&s;i|derable pain, the operator mu&s;t immediately de&s;i&s;t; le&s;t, by carrying the attempt further, floodings might be occa&s;ioned, the cord be ruptured, or the uterus inverted.

for five minutes. If it does not yet advance, ten or fifteen minutes more &s;hould be waited for; and, in the interval, a moderate degree of pre&s;&s;ure on the ab|domen, in different directions, may promote the contraction of the uterus, and a&s;&s;i&s;t the &s;eparation.

It is cruel and barbarous to employ a painful mode of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, it is criminal to hazard the con&s;equence of violence, where the &s;ame end may be obtained by gentle means, perhaps by waiting an hour or two extraor|dinary.

<HEAD>2. Method of extracting the Placenta in Ca&s;es of Flooding.</HEAD>
<P>A PROFUSE haemorrhagy &s;upervening the delivery of the child, is alarming and dangerous; if it does not &s;oon cea&s;e, fatal &s;yncope will probably en&s;ue. Though it &s;eem to abate, if the woman be low and faint, the relief may be fallacious; and is perhaps occa&s;ioned by part of the placenta forced down at the cervix uteri, and by plugging up the orifice prevents the effu&s;ion externally.</P>
<P>The con&s;equences to be dreaded can only be pre|vanted by removing the placenta; for, while one portion adheres and another is detached, there is lit|tle chance that the flooding will &s;top till the uterus be put into a condition for contracting. The hand of the operator is to be gradually, but with a certain degree of courage and re&s;olution, introduced into the uterus, taking the navel&s;tring for a guide, and ga|thering the fingers together in a conical manner. If the placenta &s;eems attached to the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, the
<PB N="171" REF="022551_0161_0FB942D152C10298">
hand already introduced mu&s;t be withdrawn, and the other pa&s;&s;ed in its &s;tead; or if, from its adhe&s;ion to|wards the upper part of the womb, it appears to be without the reach of the hand, the po&s;ition of the woman mu&s;t be altered, and &s;he mu&s;t be &s;hifted from one&s;ide to the other, from the &s;ide to the back, cro&s;s the bed, or placed on her knees and elbows, accor|ding to the particular circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>The placenta, by its firmne&s;s, can be readily di&s;|tingui&s;hed from loo&s;e clots of blood; and, from the womb, by its &s;oftne&s;s and want of feeling. It may be di&s;engaged by in&s;inuating the fingers between it and the womb, through the membranes, when the &s;eparated edge of the cake can ea&s;ily be come at. If it cannot, the thick middle part of the placentary ma&s;s &s;hould be gra&s;ped firmly, &s;preading out the fin|gers and gathering them together upon it, and in that manner gradually endeavouring to di&s;engage and bring it away. It is dangerous to &s;trip or peel it from the womb, by placing the fingers on the out&s;ide of the membranes, as authors generally advi&s;e; for, by that means, where the womb has lo&s;t its con|tractile power, a fatal deluge may be occa&s;ioned.</P>

<P>Though it might perhaps be the &s;afe&s;t practice, both in this ca&s;e and when the cord is torn, to delay the interpo&s;ition of manual a&s;&s;i&s;tance even for a day or two, when the cake will probably be expelled in time of &s;leep, &s;oon after waking, or forced off du|ring the effort of pa&s;&s;ing urine; <HI>yet there is always hazard of leaving the woman before the after-birth is de|livered.</HI> She may &s;uffer from anxiety and agitation; or a flooding from partial &s;eparation may en&s;ue, and life it&s;elf be quickly extingui&s;hed.</P>

<HEAD>4. Management in Ca&s;es of morbid Adhe&s;ion of the Cake.</HEAD>
<P>THE placenta is liable to become di&s;ea&s;ed. It &s;ometimes partially or wholly degenerates into hyda|tides, becomes &s;cirrhous, cartilaginous, more rarely bony. Either of the&s;e &s;tates is probably originally preceded with &s;ome degree of inflammation; in con|&s;equence of which the intermediate connecting mem|brane between the cake and the uterus is de&s;troyed, and a coalition formed between them.</P>
<P>Of all the cau&s;es of retention, this is the mo&s;t dif|ficult and dangerous. The ca&s;e is intricate and per|plexing. If the placenta remains, and nature fails to expel it, the woman generally dies from uterine inflammation and gangrene. She is often al&s;o the unhappy victim of the un&s;ucce&s;sful attempt of the operator: for the uterus has been torn by the offici|ous or un&s;kilful efforts of the practitioner; or mortal floodings, inflammation, or gangrene have en&s;ued.</P>
<P>If, in the&s;e circum&s;tances, we &s;hould wait for the natural expul&s;ion, the woman may be quickly de|&s;troyed by flooding, from partial &s;eparation. If we attempt to force a &s;eparation of the adhe&s;ion, by tearing the placenta from the uterus with the fingers while that organ is in a &s;tate of atony, a fatal deluge from the de&s;truction of va&s;cular &s;ub&s;tance may en&s;ue before the hand could be withdrawn from the uterus.</P>

The be&s;t and &s;afe&s;t practice, in the&s;e alarming ca|&s;es, is to defer our attempts as long as po&s;&s;ible: then, but before the putrid proce&s;s commences, to in&s;inuate the hand with the utmo&s;t caution and ten|derne&s;s; attentively examine the cake, by feeling every part of its &s;ub&s;tance; carefully avoid tearing by force at that place where the di&s;ea&s;ed hardne&s;s or &s;cirrho&s;ity is; &s;eparate cautiou&s;ly that portion which is loo&s;e and &s;oft and which yields to gentle efforts: the re&s;t mu&s;t be left to nature; to be expelled with the clean&s;ings, or de&s;troyed and di&s;charged by means of &s;uppuration.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION II. Tedious and Lingering Labour.</HEAD>
<P>A LABOUR, though &s;trictly natural, with re&s;pect to the po&s;ition of the child, the management, and termination, may be tedious and lingering in the progre&s;s or duration of its different &s;tages. This is exceedingly di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to the patient, perplexing and vexatious to the practitioner.</P>
<P>When the labour is protracted beyond the more u&s;ual limits the woman becomes anxious and deject|ed; the pains occa&s;ionally remit and recur with fre|quency and violence, or alternate with imperfect and irregular intervals of ea&s;e; the progre&s;s is &s;low and imperceptible; her &s;pirits are exhau&s;ted from re&s;t|le&s;&s;ne&s;s and apprehen&s;ion, or while the pains abate &s;he in&s;en&s;ibly falls into &s;hort but unrefre&s;hing &s;lum|bers. After a long and ob&s;tinate conflict, by the reiterated &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of feeble efforts, the head of the foetus moulds it&s;elf to the pa&s;&s;age; the crannial bones are compre&s;&s;ed; the vertex lengthens out, forming a &s;oft conical tumor; the re&s;i&s;ting yield to the propelling powers: and the birth, after perhaps a period of two or three complete days, is at la&s;t, however, &s;afely accompli&s;hed.</P>

<P>Mo&s;t of the ob&s;tacles now mentioned are to be &s;ur|mounted by patience and per&s;everance. If the labour is otherwi&s;e natural, though from peculiarity of ha|bit and a variety of particular circum&s;tances it &s;hould prove tedious, the &s;afe&s;t and be&s;t practice, in general, both for mother and child, is to tru&s;t the manage|ment <HI>wholly to nature.</HI></P>
<P>The difficulty is frequently owing merely to the re&s;i&s;tance of the &s;oft parts; hence &s;trong robu&s;t wo|men &s;uffer more than the nervous and delicate. In the
<PB N="178" REF="022551_0168_0FB942DE71447CE0">
former, the parts are ten&s;e and rigid, and &s;tretch &s;low|ly. In the latter, they are more relaxed, &s;oft, and yielding. The fir&s;t require the cooling, &s;edative plan; the latter, light nouri&s;hing food, in &s;mall quantities, often repeated, with the moderate u&s;e of cordials and anodynes. In either ca&s;e, tranquillity &s;hould be promoted, by keeping the patient quiet and ea&s;y; by con&s;tantly avoiding fatigue, bu&s;tle, and noi&s;e; at the &s;ame time &s;oothing and comforting her with the be&s;t a&s;&s;urance of a happy delivery.</P>
<P>We &s;hall conci&s;ely treat of the&s;e &s;everal cau&s;es.</P>
<P>I. In the MOTHER.</P>
<P N="1">1. Any defect in the action of the uterus it&s;elf con|&s;idered as a mu&s;cular organ, or of the auxiliary Powers of parturition, impairs the force of the labour-throes; or, in other words, renders the pains feeble and trifling.</P>
<P>The over-di&s;tention of the uterus impairs the ac|tion of its mu&s;cular fibres, and may for &s;ome time prevent tho&s;e &s;pa&s;modic efforts by which the os tin|cae is opened and the foetus expelled; there may be al&s;o other cau&s;es of torpor, or want of irritability, of which we are ignorant. Exce&s;&s;ive di&s;tention of the uterine fibres can only, however, have a temporary effect to retard the labour; and it is little in our power to obviate the defect, till the membranes can be ruptured and the water evacuated: the uterus
<PB N="179" REF="022551_0169_0FB942E1E9016020">
then coming in clo&s;e contact with the body of the foe|tus, the head will begin to pre&s;s again&s;t the orifice, and the pains become &s;trong and forcing.</P>
<P>But, as many inconveniences are known to en&s;ue from an early di&s;charge of the waters, that expedi|ent &s;hould be the re&s;ult of the mo&s;t cautious and de|liberate reflection; and &s;hould never be had recour&s;e to till the orifice be &s;ufficiently dilated. Any defect in the auxiliary powers will produce the &s;ame effect in a le&s;&s;er degree: For, &s;ince the whole &s;y&s;tem of mu&s;cular parts is employed in the action of parturiti|on, in proportion as any of the&s;e are impaired or weakened, the exertions of labour will be le&s;s &s;trong or forcing. But particularly, whatever affects the diaphragm and mu&s;cles concerned in re&s;piration, will materially impede or interrupt the action of par|turition. A narrow che&s;t, difficult re&s;piration from whatever cau&s;e, hydrops a&s;cites, &amp;c. have a con&s;ide|rable influence on delivery.</P>
<P>The treatment of all the&s;e variety of ca&s;es mu&s;t be directed with a view to remove, or obviate the cau|&s;es of interruption as much as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P N="2">2. More remotely, the progre&s;s of labour may be in|terrupted by debility, from</P>
<P><HI>a.</HI> FLOODING.&mdash;Though flooding, in advanced ge&s;tation, is always alarming and dangerous, it is
<PB N="180" REF="022551_0170_0FB942E2E62E2798">
le&s;s hazardous when it occurs along with labour-pains: for by proper management the haemorrhagy may generally be checked, till the pains become &s;trong and regular; it afterwards u&s;ually &s;tops or abates, and the delivery terminates favourably. But, if the flood|ing proceeds from the attachment of the placenta at the cervix or over the orificium uteri, which can rea|dily be known by a careful examination from touch|ing, the ca&s;e is highly alarming, the danger immi|nent, and the event to be dreaded can only be prevent|ed by an expeditious delivery.</P>
<P><HI>Diarrhaea</HI>&mdash;when exce&s;&s;ive, exhau&s;ts the patient, brings on debility, and dimini&s;hes the force of the labour pains. Warm-water gly&s;ters to wa&s;h out the rectum, and opiates, are the be&s;t palliative remedies. The &s;trength mu&s;t be kept up by proper nouri&s;hment; as beef-tea with rice, hart&s;horn gellies, &amp;c. and the moderate u&s;e of cordials.</P>
<P><HI>b.</HI> EPILEPTIC FITS&mdash;when &s;o violent or frequent|ly repeated as to leave the patient in a &s;tate of &s;tupor and in&s;en&s;ibility, retard labour, and endanger the lives of both parent and child. If the foetus &s;hould not be expelled by a few paroxy&s;ms,&mdash;if &s;ymptoms are threatening, and the child is within reach of the forceps, delivery &s;hould be effected as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. But any violent exertions to procure delivery, by for|cibly &s;tretching the parts, and counteracting nature,
<PB N="181" REF="022551_0171_0FB942E70C9B5B20">
with a view to turn the child, as many advi&s;e, is im|practicable with any probability of &s;ucce&s;s. In every in&s;tance it ought to be a rule, to wait till the head of the foetus is &s;ufficiently protruded, that the acce&s;s may be ea&s;y to apply the forceps.</P>
<P><HI>c.</HI> CRAMPISH SPASMS&mdash;are generally confined to the thighs and legs, more rarely the belly is affected. They proceed from the pre&s;&s;ure of the child's head on the nerves as it advances through the pelvis, and can only be removed by delivery.

<PB N="186" REF="022551_0176_0FB942FC9C6DDCD0">
more fatal than the latter. To draw the line of di&s;|tinction between Lingering and &s;trictly Laborious Labour, is exceedingly difficult, or to determine the critical time of interference. It is, however, an ob|ject highly, intere&s;ting:&mdash;the honour of the profe&s;|&s;ion,&mdash;the credit of the practitioner,&mdash;the important lives of a worthy mother and her progeny, depend on it; and the Accoucheur is culpable for his neglect or mi&s;conduct.</P>

<P>a. <HI>Con&s;triction or Rigidity of the cervix or Orificium Uteri.</HI>&mdash;This is one of the mo&s;t common cau&s;es of lingering labours; it chiefly occurs in elderly wo|men, in &s;trong robu&s;t con&s;titutions, or where the in|tervals between child-bearing have been di&s;tant. If the orificium uteri, in&s;tead of kindly opening with the pains, and becoming thin, &s;oft, and dilatable, &s;hould form a thick ring or flap, &s;tretch &s;lowly, and the pains are frequent, but unprofitable, a tedious la|bour may be expected. Warm gly&s;ters, injections of warm oil into the vagina, and the vapours of warm water, after the waters have pa&s;&s;ed, are the only means of relief; for it is difficult and dangerous to &s;tretch the mouth of the womb with the fingers. But, though the labour be lingering, if we have on|ly patience to wait on nature, we &s;hall generally find her efforts &s;ufficient: for, in a fir&s;t labour, or when
<PB N="187" REF="022551_0177_0FB94303B39F9380">
the woman is advanced in life, and the parts are dry and rigid, from 36 hours till three days may be re|quired for the dilatation of the orifice of the womb; yet if the management be properly regulated, neither the mother nor the child will be in danger, and the mother's recovery will perhaps go on as favourably as if the delivery had been accompli&s;hed in a few hours.</P>
<P>b. <HI>Con&s;triction or Rigidity of the Vagina and Os Ex|ternum.</HI>&mdash;The di&s;advantage of the&s;e contractions in the &s;oft parts chiefly is, that the head of the child is detained for &s;ome time from advancing without the os externum, after it has pa&s;&s;ed through the bony ca|vity. But the child &s;eldom &s;uffers; and, when in hazard, can &s;eldom be &s;aved without injuring the mother. Warm fomentations to &s;often the parts, not to heat the body, may in the&s;e ca&s;es be u&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> oil or pomatum be applied: but it is of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> con&s;equence that the parts &s;hould &s;tretch &s;lowly; &s;o that we ought not to ha&s;ten the &s;tretching by any ma|nual application.</P>
<P>c. <HI>Scirrhous or Polypous Tumors.</HI>&mdash;There is &s;eldom occa&s;ion, in ca&s;e of cicatrices about the os tincae or vagina, to dilate with the &s;calpel, to remove poly|pous tumors by exci&s;ion, or to cut upon and extract a &s;tone from the urethra in time of labour. But if
<PB N="188" REF="022551_0178_0FB94304A7B40060">
circum&s;tances are urgent, &s;uch expedients are &s;afe and practicable, and warranted by many prece|dents.</P>
<P>From previous ulceration, or laceration of the os uteri and vagina, di&s;agreeable con&s;trictions happen: but they are frequently overcome in time of labour. There are many well atte&s;ted in&s;tances, where, at the commencement of labour, it was utterly impo&s;|&s;ible to pa&s;s a finger within the contracted orifice of the vagina; yet the parts dilated as labour in|crea&s;ed, and the delivery terminated happily. In &s;ome ca&s;es, the dilatation begins during pregnancy, and is completed in time of labour.</P>
<P>d. <HI>Tumefaction from hardened faeces</HI>&mdash;frequently proves an ob&s;tacle to labour; for the contents of the gut form a large tumor, which can be readily felt from the vagina, and dimini&s;hes its cavity. This tumor has been &s;ometimes mi&s;taken for the child's head; but the mi&s;take is &s;oon di&s;covered by a &s;kilful practitioner, for it is removed by frequent gly&s;ters.</P>

<P>f. <HI>Di&s;tention of the Bladder with Urine</HI>&mdash;in &s;low la|bours, frequently occurs, and is a dangerous circum|&s;tance.

<P>g. <HI>Prolap&s;us of the Uterus, Vagina, and Rectum.</HI>&mdash;In a pelvis too wide in its dimen&s;ions, the <HI>womb</HI> at full time may de&s;cend into the vagina by the force of the throes of labour; though &s;uch ca&s;es very rarely oc|cur.

<P>II. In the CHILD, the labour may be protracted from,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Bulk and O&s;&s;ification of the Head.</HI>&mdash;There may be either a natural di&s;proportion between the head and body, or the &s;welling may be occa&s;ioned from a collection of water in the head, or be the con|&s;equence of the child's death.</P>
<P>From the &s;tructure and make of the pelvis and head in a natural &s;tate, it is evident, that a head of a lar|ger &s;ize, having the bones &s;oft and moveable, will pa&s;s through the pelvis with le&s;s difficulty, and occa|&s;ion le&s;s pain in the birth, than a &s;maller head, ha|ving the bones more &s;olid, and the &s;utures more firm|ly connected. A large head may be &s;u&s;pected when the vertex does not lengthen out by the force of the pains (as it commonly does in lingering labours); when the progre&s;s of the labour is &s;u&s;pended, though the pains continue to be &s;trong and frequent, after the &s;oft parts are &s;ufficiently dilated; when the wo|man is in good health, and there is no other apparent cau&s;e to account for the protraction.</P>
<P>When the &s;welling proceeds from a collection of water in the child's head, it may be known by the head pre&s;enting at the brim of the pelvis in a round bulky form, by the di&s;tance between the bones of the
<PB N="191" REF="022551_0181_0FB9430AAF4A6648">
head, and by a &s;oftne&s;s and fluctuation evident to the touch.</P>
<P>When the child has been long dead, the head and body often &s;well to a great &s;ize. This may be known from the hi&s;tory of the ca&s;e; from a parti|cular puffy feel of the pre&s;enting part of the child; from the di&s;charge of putrid waters, &s;ometimes mix|ed with the meconium of the child; and from the &s;eparation or peeling of the outer &s;kin of the head when touched: Though it may be here ob&s;erved, that the mo&s;t probable or &s;u&s;picious &s;ymptoms of the child's death are often deceitful.</P>
<P>From whatever cau&s;e the head is enlarged, if the difficulty ari&s;es from that circum&s;tance, and the force of the pains proves in&s;ufficient to pu&s;h it forwards; if it has made no &s;en&s;ible progre&s;s for &s;everal hours after the waters were di&s;charged, and the os uteri is fully dilated; and if the pains &s;hould begin to remit or &s;lacken, and the woman to be low, weak, or de|jected; it will then be nece&s;&s;ary to have recour&s;e to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of art.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) <HI>The unfavourable Po&s;ition of the head.</HI>&mdash;The head of the child may be &s;queezed into the pelvis in &s;uch a manner as not to admit of that compre&s;&s;ion nece&s;&s;ary for its pa&s;&s;ing through the bony cavity.</P>
<P>Where the pelvis is well formed, and the head of an ordinary &s;ize, although it &s;hould pre&s;ent in the mo&s;t awkward and unfavourable po&s;ition, it will yet
<PB N="192" REF="022551_0182_0FB9430C48BF74C8">
advance; and nature, under proper management, will, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, &s;afely accompli&s;h the delivery. The labour will unavoidably be more painful and laborious; but, whatever time may be required, there is le&s;s hazard either of the mother or child, than if delivery had been ha&s;tened by the intru&s;ion of offi|cious art.</P>
<P>But if the woman be weak or exhau&s;ted, and the pains trifling; if the head of the child be large, the bones firm, and the &s;utures clo&s;ely connected; or if there be any degree of narrowne&s;s in the pelvis; a difficult labour may be expected, and the life of both mother and child will depend on a well-timed and &s;kilful application of the &s;urgeon's hands.</P>
<P>The unfavourable po&s;ition of the head may be re|ferred to two kinds, which include a con&s;iderable variety.</P>

<P>Fir&s;t, <HI>When the Fontanella, or Open of the Head, in&s;tead of the Vertex,</HI> fir&s;t pre&s;ents to the touch, a more painful or tedious labour may be expected: for the head does not take the &s;ame mechanical turns in pa&s;&s;ing through the pelvis as in natural labour; the face either originally pre&s;ents to the pubes, or takes that direction in pa&s;&s;ing. The bulky crown is forced within the brim of the pelvis with more diffi|culty;
<PB N="193" REF="022551_0183_0FB9430DC28051E0">
the progre&s;s of the labour is more &s;low and painful; and, when the head has advanced &s;o far that the crown pre&s;&s;es on the &s;oft parts at the bottom of the pelvis, there is much greater hazard of the tearing of the perinaeum, than when the lengthened|out vertex pre&s;ents: but, if no other ob&s;tacle occurs, the labour, notwith&s;tanding, will, by proper ma|nagement, generally end well; and much injury may be done by the intru&s;ion of officious hands.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>Face-Ca&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>Of laborious births, face-ca&s;es are the mo&s;t diffi|cult and trouble&s;ome. From its length, roughne&s;s, and inequality the face mu&s;t occa&s;ion greater pain; and, from the &s;olidity of the bones, it mu&s;t yield to the propelling force of labour throes with more diffi|culty than the &s;mooth moveable bones of the crani|um. Our &s;ucce&s;s in delivery in the&s;e ca&s;es will chiefly depend on a prudent management, by care|ly &s;upporting the &s;trength of the woman.</P>
<P>The variety of face-ca&s;es are known by the direc|tion of the chin; for the face may pre&s;ent.</P>

<P>The rule in all the&s;e po&s;itions is, to allow the la|bour to go on till the face be protruded as low as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>It is often as difficult and hazardous to pu&s;h back
<PB N="194" REF="022551_0184_0FB943135480DEF0">
the child, and to bring down the crown or vertex, as to turn the child and deliver it by the feet.</P>
<P>Sometimes a &s;kilful arti&s;t may &s;ucceed in his at|tempt to alter the po&s;ition, when he has the ma|nagement of the delivery from the beginning; or in tho&s;e ca&s;es where the face is con&s;iderably advanced in the pelvis, may be able to give a&s;&s;i&s;tance by pa&s;|&s;ing a finger or two in the child's mouth and pulling down the jaw, which le&s;&s;ens the bulk of the head; or, by pre&s;&s;ing on the chin, to bring it under the arch of the pubes, when the crown getting into the hollow of the &s;acrum, the head will afterwards pa&s;s ea&s;ily. But, in general, FACE-CASES &s;hould be tru&s;ted to nature; and interpo&s;ition by the hand, or in&s;truments, is &s;eldom advi&s;able or even &s;afe.</P>
<P N="3">(3) <HI>The Bulk, or improper De&s;cent of the Shoulders</HI> through the pelvis, rarely proves the cau&s;e of protract|ed labour. The head is always pretty far advanced before any ob&s;truction can ari&s;e from this cau&s;e; and, if the head has already pa&s;&s;ed, in a pain or two the &s;houlders will follow. The &s;ame rea&s;oning will al&s;o apply with regard to the aperture of the uterus it&s;elf. If the head pa&s;&s;es freely, in like manner will the &s;houlders: the os uteri rarely, if ever, is capable of contracting upon the neck of the child, and thus pre|venting the advance of the &s;houlders; and, &s;hould this prove the ca&s;e, what can we do but wait with pati|ence? After the delivery of the head, if the woman
<PB N="195" REF="022551_0185_0FB94314698CB418">
falls into deliquia; or if, after &s;everal pains, the &s;houlders do not follow, and the child's life be in danger from delay; we &s;hould naturally be induced to help it forward in the gentle&s;t manner we are able, by pa&s;&s;ing a finger on each &s;ide as far as the axilla, and thus gradually pulling along: or, if this method fails, the &s;houlders may be di&s;engaged by pre&s;&s;ing on the &s;capula.</P>
<P>III. The third general cau&s;e of Tedious or Lin|gering Labour, ari&s;es from the PLACENTA, its Apendages, and the LIQUOR AMNII.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Membranes may be too &s;trong or too weak.</HI>&mdash;From the former of the&s;e cau&s;es, the birth is, in &s;ome in&s;tances, rendered tedious; but, as the &s;ame effect is more frequently produced by the contrary, and the con&s;equences are much more trouble&s;ome and dangerous, practitioners &s;hould be exceedingly cautious of having recour&s;e to the common expedient of breaking them till there be a great probability that the difficulty proceeds from that circum&s;tance; and, even then, it ought not to be done till the parts be completely dilated, and the head of the child well advanced in the pelvis.</P>
<P>Many inconveniences en&s;ue from a premature evacuation of the waters: for the parts then become dry and rigid: the dilatation goes on more &s;lowly;
<PB N="196" REF="022551_0186_0FB94318B08F2700">
the pains often either remit, or become le&s;s &s;trong and forcing, although not le&s;s painful and fatiguing; the mouth of the womb which was previou&s;ly thin and yielding, may be ob&s;erved to contract, and to form a thick ring, for &s;ome time ob&s;tinately re&s;i&s;ting the force of the pains; the woman's &s;trength lan|gui&s;hes, and her &s;pirits are overcome and exhau&s;ted; and, at la&s;t, the child's head becomes locked into the pelvis, merely from want of force of the pains to propel it.</P>
<P>An inconvenience of <HI>too great rigidity</HI> of the mem|branes is, that the child at full time may be pro|truded, inclo&s;ed in the complete membranous bag, &s;urrounded with the waters. But &s;uch in&s;tances &s;el|dom occur. When the whole ovum is thus protru|ded at once, there is hazard of flooding from the &s;udden detachment of the placenta and membranes. It &s;hould, therefore, be prevented by breaking the membranes, when they advance and &s;pread out at the os externum, and the head of the child follows in the &s;ame direction.</P>
<P>The method of breaking the membranes is, to pinch them between the finger and thumb; to pu&s;h a finger again&s;t them in time of a pain; to run the &s;tilet of catheter through them; or, when there is lit|tle water protruded, and they are applied clo&s;e in contact with the child's head, they mu&s;t be de&s;troyed by &s;catching with the nail; but care ought to be

taken le&s;t the &s;calp of the child's head, covered with mucus, &s;hould be mi&s;taken for the membranes.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Waters may be too copious, or too &s;paring.</HI>&mdash;The fir&s;t is inconvenient; for, by this means, the weight of the water gravitating to the under-part of the membranes in time of a pain, may bur&s;t them too early, and occa&s;ion the di&s;advantages before-mentioned.</P>
<P><HI>An extraordinary quantity of Water</HI>&mdash;may over&s;tretch the womb, and prevent or weaken the pains. Such a cau&s;e of protraction may be &s;u&s;pected, if the fir&s;t &s;tage of labour goes on very &s;lowly, if the woman be very big-bellied, and if much time be &s;pent before the head of the child becomes locked in the bones of the pelvis. In the&s;e circum&s;tances, if the pains &s;hould cea&s;e or become trifling, the membranes may be ruptured with &s;afety and advantage.</P>
<P><HI>Little or no Water</HI>&mdash;is &s;ometimes contained in the membranes. The parts, then, &s;tretch with more difficulty and pain, and mu&s;t be lubricated from time to time with butter or pomatum, in the manner mentioned under the article of <HI>Rigidity of the &s;oft Parts.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The Cord may be too &s;hort, or too long.</HI>&mdash;The extraordinary length of the cord, by forming folds round the child's neck or body, may prove the cau&s;e of protracted labour: but there is generally &s;ufficient

length to admit of the birth of the child &s;afely; and it is time enough, after the child is delivered, to &s;lip the noo&s;e over the &s;houlders and head. After the head is protruded, the &s;houlders are &s;eldom prevented from advancing by folds of the cord round the neck; and it very rarely becomes nece&s;&s;ary to pa&s;s a finger between the child's neck and the cord, in order to divide the cord while the child is in the birth; a practice that may be attended with trouble and hazard.</P>
<P>Another inconvenience of the great length of the cord, though it may al&s;o proceed from the low at|tachment of the placenta, is,</P>
<P><HI>The prolap&s;us or falling down of the Cord, doubled, before the Child's Head.</HI>&mdash;A circum&s;tance which often proves fatal to the child; for, if it be not reduced by pu&s;hing it up within the uterus, beyond the bulky head of the child, and prevented from returning with the fingers, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ill the head, by the force of the pain, de&s;cends into the pelvis, the circulation will &s;oon &s;top from the pre&s;&s;ure of the cord between the head and pelvis, and the child will infallibly peri&s;h. If this method of reducing the cord &s;hould fail, or if the pains be too quick and forcing to admit of the at|tempt, a warm cloth &s;hould be applied to the os ex|ternum over the cord, to cover it from the cold, and the natural pains &s;hould be waited for; if the pains <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e very &s;trong and forcing, and the progre&s;s of labour quick, the child may yet be born alive. Some advi&s;e

to pre&s;erve the child, by turning and delivering by the feet; but it is, at be&s;t, a precarious expedient: for new difficulties may afterwards occur; the operation of turning is painful and hazardous; and it would be extremely criminal to expo&s;e the mother's life to danger, when there is no certainty of pre&s;erving the child.</P>
<P>The navel-&s;tring is, &s;ometimes, naturally thick and knotty; or thickened, and of con&s;equence &s;hort|ened, by di&s;ea&s;e.

<P N="4">4. The fourth cau&s;e is, <HI>The improper attachment of the Placenta over the Orifice of the Womb,</HI> and is a more dangerous circum&s;tance than any other; for, if the delivery be not &s;peedily accompli&s;hed, blood, from the &s;eparation of the placenta, will pour out &s;o profu&s;ely, that the unfortunate woman will very quickly &s;ink under it. This unhappy event can be prevented by no other means but by an expeditious de|livery. The alarming &s;ituation of the woman will be &s;ufficiently indicated by the appearance and ra|pid increa&s;e of flooding, and by the &s;oft pappy feel of the after-birth to the touch.

<PB N="203" REF="022551_0195_0FB94337AA5FBB88">
<HEAD>GENERAL RULES for u&s;ing the FORCEPS.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. The forceps &s;hould never be employed till the fir&s;t &s;tage of labour be completely accompli&s;hed; till the head of the child is protruded below the brim of the pelvis; and till, by the continued pre&s;&s;ure of the head, the tumor of the perinaeum is in &s;ome degree formed.</P>
<P N="2">2. As the &s;afety of the mother is our only apology for u&s;ing in&s;truments, the forceps &s;hould never be employed but in the mo&s;t urgent and nece&s;&s;itous ca|&s;es: as, for example, when the woman is much &s;pent or exhau&s;ted: when the parts are &s;welled, a|long with <HI>&s;uppre&s;&s;io urinae;</HI> when the pains are weak or trifling, or have cea&s;ed entirely, and are not likely to recur; or when &s;he is threatened with convul&s;ions, floodings, or faintings.</P>
<P N="3">3. The contents of the rectum and bladder &s;hould be emptied in all ca&s;es where in&s;truments are employ|ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t the delivery.</P>
<P N="4">4. The po&s;ition of the head &s;hould be exactly known before attempting to apply the forceps.</P>
<P N="5">5. The po&s;ition of the woman mu&s;t be regulated by the pre&s;entation of the child's head. In the &s;im|ple&s;t and ea&s;ie&s;t of the forceps ca&s;es, when the head is &s;o far advanced as to pre&s;s con&s;iderably again&s;t the perinaeum, and the ears are nearly lateral or diagonal, &s;he may be placed on her back or &s;ide, with her

breech over the edge of the bed; but, when the head is higher in the pelvis, and the ears towards the pubes and &s;acrum, the &s;ide, with the knees drawn up to the belly, as in natural labour, is the mo&s;t commodious po&s;ition both for the patient and opera|tor.</P>
<P N="6">6. The parts of the woman mu&s;t be gently &s;tretch|ed and well lubricated with the hand gradually introduced into the vagina, and the operator &s;hould be able to touch the ear of the child with one or more fingers, before he attempts to introduce the fir&s;t blade of the forceps.</P>
<P N="7">7. The Accoucheur being placed on a low &s;eat, or in a kneeling po&s;ture, let the right hand be &s;lowly pa&s;&s;ed through the vagina into the pelvis, and &s;earch for the ear of the child, which will always be found under the ramus of the i&s;chium, towards the pubes, or diagonally.</P>
<P N="8">8. He mu&s;t then, with the left-hand take up the fir&s;t blade of the forceps, previou&s;ly lubricated, and warmed if the weather is cold, and conduct it along the palm of the right-hand, between it and the head of the child, till the point of the clam reaches the ear. The handle mu&s;t be h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ld backwards towards the perinacum to direct the point in the axis of the pelvis.</P>
<P N="9">9. It mu&s;t then be in&s;inuated very &s;lowly by a wriggling kind of motion, and the point kept clo&s;e

to the head of the child, pu&s;hing it on till it be applied along the &s;ide of the head over the ear.</P>
<P N="10">10. The fir&s;t introduced hand mu&s;t then be with|drawn, the handle of the fir&s;t blade &s;teadily &s;ecured with it, and the other blade introduced, guided along the left-hand, in the &s;ame &s;low cautious manner and direction with the former.</P>
<P N="11">11. The blades being applied over the ears of the child, and the handles placed exactly oppo&s;ite to each other, the&s;e la&s;t are to be brought gradually to|gether; carefully locked; and, le&s;t they &s;hould &s;lip in extracting, properly &s;ecured by tying a fillet or garter round them; but this mu&s;t be loo&s;ed during the intervals of pulling, to prevent the brain from being injured by the continued pre&s;&s;ure.</P>
<P N="12">12. If difficulties occur in the introduction <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> &s;econd blade, or in bringing the handles together, the re&s;i&s;tance mu&s;t not be attempted to be &s;urmounted by force; but that blade &s;hould be withdrawn a lit|tle, and the point &s;omewhat rai&s;ed, by pre&s;&s;ing the handle to the oppo&s;ite &s;ide; and, if the &s;econd intro|duced blade cannot be made an exact antagoni&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o the fir&s;t, it, or if nece&s;&s;ary both blades, mu&s;t be with|drawn, and again introduced as already directed.</P>
<P N="13">13. It &s;hould be a con&s;tant rule, when difficulties occur in pa&s;&s;ing the forceps, to introduce the mo&s;t trouble&s;ome blade fir&s;t.

<P N="22">22. If, after &s;everal attempts the forceps cannot be &s;ecurely applied, or, after a firm hold is obtain|ed, the head does not yield to repeated efforts mode|rately exerted, they mu&s;t be dropped, and the delive|ry otherwi&s;e managed according to the di&s;cretion and judgment of the practitioner.</P>

<HEAD>PARTICULAR CASES.</HEAD>
<P>IF the general rules for u&s;ing the forceps are under|&s;tood, we &s;hall &s;eldom be at a lo&s;s how to apply them in particular ca&s;es. They may be reduced to two general cla&s;&s;es:

<ITEM>2. The face, pre&s;enting.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I. The variety of ca&s;es where the CRANIUM pre|&s;ents, chiefly are,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Natural Pre&s;entation,</HI> with the head &s;o far advan|ced that the perinaeal tumor is con&s;iderably formed, the ears of the child nearly lateral, and the face to the coccyx.</P>
<P>The LEVER, by an expert practitioner, may be
<PB N="209" REF="022551_0199_0FB9433E812E1FC0">
&s;ometimes in this pre&s;entation &s;ucce&s;sfully employ|ed.</P>
<P>If the FORCEPS are u&s;ed, the woman may be ei|ther placed in the natural po&s;ition, or on her back; it is &s;carce nece&s;&s;ary, then, to tie the handles. When applied, a pain &s;hould be waited for. With one hand the perinaeum &s;hould be guarded; with the other, the handles of the forceps gently rai&s;ed towards the woman's belly, to bring the hind-head with a half-round turn from under the arch of the pubes; the operator at the &s;ame time ri&s;ing from his knees, if the woman be placed on her back.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Vertex pre&s;enting with the Face laterally in the Pelvis.</HI>&mdash;The forceps can be &s;eldom applied with &s;afety in this po&s;ition till the bulky part of the head has pa&s;&s;ed the brim, with the vertex pre&s;&s;ing a|gain&s;t the under part of the i&s;chium, and till an ear can be felt under the arch of the pubes.</P>
<P>The ear when felt, will determine to which &s;ide the face points.</P>
<P>Let the woman be placed on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide where the face is.</P>
<P>Let the blade under the pubes be fir&s;t applied, with the fore-part of the clam, to the occiput of the child.</P>
<P>Let the &s;econd blade be introduced oppo&s;ite to the fir&s;t. Bring the handles together, and &s;ecure with a fillet.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="022551_0200_0FB9433FEB3D59E8">
Gently move from blade to blade; favouring the direction (of the face to the &s;acrum) which the head as it advances naturally takes; and, as the birth ap|proaches, u&s;ing the proper precautions to &s;ave the pe|rinaeum.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Fontanel pre&s;entations</HI>&mdash;are the mo&s;t difficult and dangerous of the forceps ca&s;es.</P>
<P>In the progre&s;s of the labour we generally find, when the crown pre&s;ents, that the face points to the pubes; but the po&s;ition can be readily learned from the fi|gure of the fontanel and the direction of the ear.</P>
<P>The common &s;hort forceps can &s;eldom be &s;ucce&s;s|fully employed here, till the head be con&s;iderably ad|vanced in the pelvis. The forceps &s;hould never be attempted to be applied in the fontanel pre&s;entations till an ear can be ea&s;ily felt. They mu&s;t be intro|duced over the ears, and the extraction conducted on the general principles; carefully ob&s;erving the direction which the head inclines to take, and pro|ceeding in the mo&s;t cautious deliberate manner, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the parts of the woman may have time to &s;tretch.</P>
<P>When the fontanel pre&s;ents, with the crown of the head nearly equal with the brim of the pelvis, and the face placed to the pubes or &s;acrum, the long ax|is of the head inter&s;ects the &s;hort diameter of the pelvis. Though the forceps be applied in this po&s;ition, and a firm hold obtained, it is &s;ometimes impo&s;&s;ible to accompli&s;h the extraction; as the head
<PB N="211" REF="022551_0201_0FB9434166BBFC30">
will neither advance in the &s;ame direction, nor can the pre&s;entation be altered by pu&s;hing up and ma|king the mechanical turns which Dr SMELLIE di|rects, without the hazard of injuring the mother.</P>
<P>If the common method, therefore fails, the forceps &s;hould be withdrawn, and the long ones attempted to be applied over the forehead and occiput. As the volume of the head, by the compre&s;&s;ion it &s;uffers from the action of the forceps, will be &s;omewhat di|mini&s;hed the extraction may be then &s;ucce&s;sfully performed, and the child pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>If this method &s;hould al&s;o fail, in preference to the dreadful operation of embryotomy, Dr LEAK's double-curved forceps with the third blade may be had recour&s;e to. But of this expedient little can be &s;aid with confidence; for the introduction of a third blade into a narrow pa&s;&s;age, when two have already per|haps been pa&s;&s;ed with difficulty, however ingenious the invention, is not ea&s;ily to be put in practice.</P>
<P>All other varieties of cranial ca&s;es mu&s;t be treated according to the rules already directed.</P>
<P>II. FACE PRESENTATIONS.&mdash;From its length and unequal &s;urface the face will occa&s;ion greater pain, and from the &s;olidity of the bones it yields to the propelling force with more difficulty, than the uniform moveable &s;urface of the cranium. The head will, however, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, advance in that
<PB N="212" REF="022551_0202_0FB94343ACE0EFF8">
po&s;ition, by the force of the natural-pains, though the delivery will be more &s;low or painful. I have &s;eldom had occa&s;ion, in a well-formed pelvis, to in|terfere in face-pre&s;entations, in any other manner than by introducing two fingers into the mouth, and pulling down the jaw.</P>
<P>As the attempts of the mo&s;t expert practitioners, if too early exerted, may be attended with fatal con|&s;equences; and, even when a&s;&s;i&s;tance is given at the proper time, our endeavours are often di&s;appointed; in whatever manner the face pre&s;ents, it &s;hould be allowed to advance as low as po&s;&s;ible: by which means the acce&s;s will be more ea&s;y; and the po&s;i|tion, for the application of in&s;truments, more fa|vourable.</P>
<P>In the&s;e awkward po&s;itions, the injury occa&s;ion|ed by officious interference has been often fatal; whereas, if time had been given, and the patient pro|perly &s;upported, the delivery would have generally ended well.</P>
<P>The variety of FACE-CASES may be reduced to the following.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1<HI>&s;t,</HI> The face pre&s;enting with the chin to the pubes.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2<HI>dly,</HI> To the &s;acrum.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3<HI>dly,</HI> Laterally.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Face-po&s;itions are readily known, from the ine|qualities of the &s;urface to the touch; from the pro|minent

<P>The &s;ucce&s;s of the practitioner, in the&s;e ca&s;es, will depend on the bulk of the head, the make of the pelvis, and the progre&s;s of the labour; for, &s;hould the head be firmly wedged in the pelvis, no force that can be employed with &s;afety would be &s;ufficient to alter the po&s;ition.</P>

<P>WHEN the infant could not be &s;aved by the mode of delivery employed in the extraction, the operation was termed by the ancients, <HI>Embryo|tomy.</HI></P>
<P>The object of this operation is to &s;ave the mother, when the child cannot be delivered in any other man|ner. It &s;hould never, therefore, be performed, while there is any rea&s;onable pro&s;pect of extracting the child alive; and &s;hould, when con&s;i&s;tent with the mother's &s;afe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y, be delayed till the child be dead.</P>
<P>Extreme narrowne&s;s of the pelvis, or extraordina|ry bulk of the child, are the only circum&s;tances which ju&s;tify the nece&s;&s;ity of having recour&s;e to the horid operation of embryotomy.</P>
<P>The chief cau&s;e of difficult labour, is dimini&s;hed capacity of the pelvis from di&s;tortion. For when the

<P>We judge of the figure and dimen&s;ions of the pel|vis, by the general make and con&s;truction of the wo|man; by the progre&s;s of the labour; by the touch. When the fault is confined to the bottom, it will readily be di&s;covered: <HI>e. g.</HI> if a bump is felt on the anterior &s;urface of the os &s;acrum, in&s;tead of a conca|vity: if the coccyx is angular towards the pubes; if the &s;ymphy&s;is pubis is angular towards the &s;acrum; if the tubero&s;ities of the i&s;chia approach too near each other; or if one tuber be higher than the other; &s;uch ap|pearances are deci&s;ive marks of a faulty pelvis.</P>
<P>When the narrowne&s;s is confined to the brim, it can only be detected by the introduction of the hand into the pelvis; and a con&s;iderable force and repeti|tion of pain will be requi&s;ite to protrude any part of the child's head through the &s;uperior &s;trait of the pel|vis.</P>

re-&s;hut, half-turned, and again widely opened, &s;o as to make a crucial hole in the &s;kull.

<HEAD>II. USE of the CROTCHET and BLUNT-HOOK.</HEAD>
<P>The method of introducing the crotchet is, to conduct the point along the hand, like the &s;ci&s;&s;ars, till a &s;ecure hold of the child's head be obtained.</P>
<P>It was formerly u&s;ually applied on the out&s;ide of the &s;kull only: but the hook &s;hould be always intro|duced within the opening, and the hand of the ope|rator &s;hould be pa&s;&s;ed into the vagina to pre&s;s the fin|gers on the out&s;ide of the cranium oppo&s;ite, during the efforts of pulling with the crotchet, le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t by loo|&s;ing its hold it &s;hould injure the woman; the con|&s;eq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nces of which might be very unfortunate or even fatal.</P>
<P>Dr SMELLIE directs the crotchet to be fixed on the <HI>out&s;ide</HI> of the &s;kull, which is more difficult and hazardous than the method now employed; and his
<PB N="221" REF="022551_0211_0FB9435DECD3B928">
directions have been, till of late, very generally fol|lowed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Some writers direct us to introduce the crotchet within the &s;kull, and, pre&s;&s;ing one hand again&s;t the point on the out&s;ide, pull along. But this is a <HI>trifling expedient:</HI> and, if a good deal of force is u&s;ed, the in&s;trument tears through the thin bone, and hurts the operators hand, or the woman's vagina, if not both: Whereas, in the other method, there is much more certainty, and a better purcha&s;e to force along the head, which collap&s;es and is dimini&s;hed as the brain is di&s;charged, and never comes down in a broad flattened form, according to the allegations of &s;ome people who&s;e idea of the&s;e things are imperfect and confu&s;ed," &amp;c. <HI>Smel|lie's Midwifery,</HI> Book iii. &s;ect 7.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>When the hook &s;lips its hold, the loo&s;e pieces of bone mu&s;t be carefully &s;eparated and removed with the fingers; the crotchet mu&s;t again be applied a little higher, and the pulling force repeated as before: proceeding in this manner till the &s;uperior part of the cranium is cut and divided, and the &s;ub&s;tance of the brain di&s;charged.</P>
<P>The chief objects to be attended to be in the intro|duction of the hook, are, fir&s;t to guide the point with the fingers within the opening of the cranium; then, by moving it backwards and forwards, to per|vade the bone &s;o as to &s;ecure a firm hold; and, la&s;tly, in extracting, to guard again&s;t the accidents of wounding or otherwi&s;e injuring the woman, which might readily happen if it &s;hould lo&s;e its hold.</P>

<PB N="222" REF="022551_0212_0FB9435F6C048A18">
already mentioned, the point of the crotchet &s;hould never, if po&s;&s;ible, be tru&s;ted beyond where the fingers can ea&s;ily reach.</P>
<P>One blade, in general, is &s;ufficient to be employed for the extraction. Both branches can &s;eldom be u&s;ed at once with advantage or &s;afety.</P>
<P>After the brain is di&s;charged, the <HI>blunt-hook</HI> may be &s;ucce&s;sfully employed as an extractor, where the pel|vis is not remarkably faulty. The &s;mall end is to be pa&s;&s;ed into the opening of the cranium, and the point to be guarded with great care, by pre&s;&s;ing externally on the cranium, oppo&s;ite, as in u&s;ing the crotchet.</P>
<P>As ca&s;es of extreme narrowne&s;s of the pelvis from di&s;tortion very &s;eldom occur, the head will, in gene|neral, yield to repeated efforts of pulling, in the man|ner ju&s;t now directed.</P>
<P>If this method &s;hould fail, the crotchet mu&s;t be introduced within the opening as before, and fixed in the ba&s;is of the &s;kull where a &s;ecure hold can be obtained; the handle &s;hould be covered with a cloth, to enable the operator to take a firm hold; the point &s;hould in general be directed po&s;teriorly to the mother; and in employing the nece&s;&s;ary exerti|ons of pulling, the axis of the pelvis and vagina &s;hould be attended to. The operator &s;hould then en|deavour to bring down the head by pulling at fir&s;t moderately, and at proper intervals increa&s;ing the

<P>In face-ca&s;es, where it is impracticable to alter the po&s;ition, and when the pelvis is much di&s;torted, the the double crotchet is recommended; the handles mu&s;t be well &s;ecured, kept well backwards towards the perinaeum, and the motion always from blade to blade. It very &s;eldom, however, happens that there is occa&s;ion for the double crotchet: by this means the head is flattened in pulling, and prevented from ta|king the proper direction; whereas if one blade only be employed, the head is lengthened, and in pulling can better accommodate it&s;elf to the &s;hape of the pel|vis as it pa&s;&s;es along.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, in face-pre&s;entations, by applying one blade only towards the lateral part, and pulling ob|liquely to the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, the po&s;ition may be al|tered, and ea&s;y acce&s;s at la&s;t obtained to the hairy &s;calp, to make the perforation, evacuate the brain, and dimini&s;h the volume of the head.</P>

The parti|cular circum&s;tances of this &s;ingle hi&s;tory, as communicated to me by Mr Smith him&s;elf, are as follows.&mdash;A young woman had been &s;everal days in &s;trong labour; the head, he imagined, had origi|nally pre&s;ented in an oblique direction at the brim of the pelvis. The patient was &s;o much exhau&s;ted when Mr Smith was called, and &s;he was otherwi&s;e &s;eemingly &s;o low, that it was doubtful to him whether &s;he could &s;upport the fatigue of delivery. The ca&s;e appeared the more di&s;couraging and unfavourable, becau&s;e, on touching, he could not determine the manner in which the child pre&s;ented, its head having been formerly cut off from the body by an un&s;ucce&s;sful attempt to procure a delivery; nor could he even po&s;itively &s;ay, whether it was a foetus, or a very &s;ingular mon|&s;trous production, from the uncommon feel which the ragged &s;tump of the neck gave to the touch. Determined, however, to give the woman a chance of life, he fixed a crotchet in the part which pre&s;ented, brought down fir&s;t one arm, then another; and afterwards, to his a&s;toni&s;hment, extracted the trunk of a <HI>body with|out a head.</HI> On inquiry, he was informed that a &s;urgeon in the neighbourhood had in vain, after many fruitle&s;s efforts, attempt|ed to make the extraction, but abandoned the woman in that &s;itu|ation, and a&s;&s;ured the relations it was not po&s;&s;ible to accompli&s;h the delivery; which they had artfully concealed from Mr Smith.

<P>In tho&s;e ca&s;es of narrow pelvis, where it is ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary to dimini&s;h the volume of the child's head to procure the extraction with &s;afety to the mo|ther, our &s;ucce&s;s will chiefly depend on a &s;ea&s;onable performance of the fir&s;t part of the operation. The head &s;hould be opened, and the brain di&s;charged, as &s;oon as the dilatation of the orificium uteri will admit of it. The woman may be then &s;afely allowed to re&s;t for 24 hours or more, even till the compages of

the cranial bones of the foetus be &s;omewhat di&s;&s;olved by putrefaction; the natural pains, during that pro|ce&s;s, will either be &s;ufficient to accompli&s;h the birth; or the head will by their means be protruded &s;o low, that the acce&s;s will be ea&s;y to apply the crotchet, and little force be nece&s;&s;ary to procure the extraction. Whereas, if the fir&s;t part of the operation (to wit, making a &s;ufficient opening into the cranium for the di&s;charge of the brain) be too long delayed, the con|&s;equence of violent mechanical force employed, where the extraction mu&s;t be performed in ha&s;te, may be fa|tal to the patient.</P>
<P>For the propriety of this practice we can appeal to the experience of every practitioner; and if argu|ments were nece&s;&s;ary to enforce it, we might refer to various hi&s;tories mentioned by authors, where the head of a foetus in a &s;emi-putrid &s;tate was expelled by the natural pains, after it had been &s;evered from the body and retained in the uterus for &s;everal days; the unfortunate woman having been abandoned to the mo&s;t deplorable &s;tate of de&s;pair by the inhuman o|perator.</P>

<P>The operation being fini&s;hed, the contractile efforts of the uterus are to be waited for to expel the child. The patient is afterwards to be confined to bed for &s;eve|ral weeks, a bandage to be applied round the loins, and the management directed on general principles. But if the natural pains &s;hould then fail, the &s;ci&s;&s;ars and crotchet mu&s;t be u&s;ed; the child mu&s;t be turned; or the Cae&s;arian &s;ection had recour&s;e to.</P>

For, if the mother could be delivered by the crot|chet with &s;afety, at the expence of de&s;troying the child, that method will always be preferable to a pre|carious attempt to &s;ave the child, at the hazard of the mother's life. If the pain and danger &s;he &s;uffers in the new operation, is not to be compen&s;ated by

Such a propo&s;ition in this country would be rejected with contempt by the generality of practitioners.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cae&s;arean &s;ection</HI> is the third method propo&s;ed for accompli&s;hing delivery with &s;afety to the child, the &s;ection of the pubes having failed, if the child cannot be ea&s;ily extracted by the crotchet.

<P>Dr LEAK has, with his u&s;ual judgement, good &s;en&s;e, and humanity, con&s;idered the advantages and di&s;advantages of the Sigaultian operation; and &s;eems to favour it in preference to the Cae&s;arean &s;ec|tion, becau&s;e the former <Q>does not carry with it tho&s;e ideas of cruelty which attend the latter, where the patient is, as it were, embowelled alive.

<HEAD>&sect; 4. Method of EXTRACTING the CHILD by the CAESAREAN SECTION.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the child could not be delivered by the natural pa&s;&s;ages, or when a woman died un|delivered though the child was probably alive, an o|peration with a view to pre&s;erve the mother and child in the fir&s;t ca&s;e, and to &s;ave the child in the latter, has been &s;trongly recommended.

There is much rea&s;on, however, to &s;u&s;pect, that this relation, like many o|ther &s;tories of Pliny, is fabulous; and it is more rea|&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that the name, in fact, was the

But in tho&s;e days the Grecian phy&s;icians were held in abhorrence for the cruelty of their operations, and it is &s;carcely probable they would then dare to propo&s;e the delivery of the child by an expedient which appeared to be as ra&s;h and formidable in the attempt as dangerous in the con&s;equences. If there is any foundation for the &s;tory, it probably refers to the attempt of &s;aving the child by this ope|ration in ca&s;es of the &s;udden death of the mother: for there is no certain accounts of its having ever been performed by the ancients on the living &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Books are full of hi&s;tories to &s;how that Hi&s;teroto|my has been practi&s;ed with &s;ucce&s;s by the moderns on various occa&s;ions; yet authors are much divided in opinion on the &s;ubject. Some po&s;itively deny that a woman can &s;urvive the daring attempt: while others contend that it is frequently &s;afe, though ge|nerally dangerous; and relate many examples where it has not only been performed with &s;ucce&s;s, but re|peatedly practi&s;ed on the &s;ame &s;ubject.</P>

<P>In the ca&s;e related by Dr COOPER, Vol. V. of the&s;e E&s;&s;ays, the greate&s;t &s;pace of the tran&s;ver&s;e dia|meter at the brim did not exceed 1&frac14; inch, to wit,

from the projection of the &s;acrum to the &s;ymphy&s;is pubis; and gradually became narrower at each &s;ide, till it terminated laterally in a &s;mall point<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">London Medical E&s;&s;ays and Inquiries, Vol. V. p. 225.</NOTE>. At the bottom the rami i&s;chii were &s;o much contracted, that the &s;pace between them was &s;omewhat le&s;s than half an inch.</P>
<P>It is obvious to a demon&s;tration, that the volume of the head of a mature foetus cannot, by the operation of embryulcia, be dimini&s;hed to &s;uch a &s;ize as to ren|der it capable of pa&s;&s;ing through a pelvis who&s;e di|men&s;ions do not exceed either of tho&s;e ju&s;t now men|tioned.</P>
<P>The following ca&s;e, however, &s;hows the perfection to which we have now arrived in the con&s;truction of ob&s;tetrical in&s;truments. Dr KELLIE extracted a mature foetus through the openings of a di&s;torted pelvis, who&s;e dimen&s;ions were the&s;e: Tran&s;ver&s;ely at the brim from the arch at the &s;acrum to the &s;ym|phy&s;is pubis, 1 inch 5/<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ths and 1/16th; on the right|&s;ide of the &s;trait, 2 1/16th inches; on the left-&s;ide, 1&frac12; inch. The woman had been five days in &s;trong la|bour before Dr KELLIE had an opportunity of &s;ee|ing her. <Q>The head remained above the brim of the pelvis, and had not then made the &s;malle&s;t progre&s;s. It was of a large &s;ize, firmly o&s;&s;ified; and the parts in the pa&s;&s;ages were &s;o extremely
<PB N="242" REF="022551_0232_0FB9438EA55459C8">
tender, that the poor woman, who was &s;omewhat faint and much fatigued by the protraction of labour, could not bear the mo&s;t gentle examination without great pain.</Q> The Doctor proceeded to perform the operation of embryulcia <Q>by making a large opening in the cranium, which was effect|ed with difficulty, on account of the head project|ing &s;o much over the pubes that the &s;hank of the &s;ci&s;&s;ars was pre&s;&s;ed forcibly again&s;t the perinaeum, to get the points in a proper direction.</Q> He now left the patient; and on returning, in 24 hours af|ter, <Q>found the head advanced into the pelvis &s;o low, that the jagged end of one of the parietal bones pre&s;&s;ed again&s;t the inner part of the perinaeum, very near the os externum. By the help of the blunt-hook only, the head was brought forth, in little more than a quarter of an hour, amazing|ly flattened.</Q> The &s;houlders and body gave con|&s;iderable re&s;i&s;tance, but were al&s;o extracted with the blunt-hook.</P>
<P>It is much to be regretted, that the unfortunate patient, who &s;eemed to do well for a week, <Q>having imprudently drank freely of raw porter, with &s;ome people who came to &s;ee her, was afterwards &s;ei|zed with a violent purging, of which &s;he died in three days<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John&s;on's Midwifery, page 284.</NOTE>.</Q></P>

The above ca&s;e affords, however, an important le&s;&s;on of in&s;truction to practitioners of midwifery.

For, by waiting with patience, as long as there is time for it, the head will collap&s;e, and be protruded &s;o low by the force of the pains, that the acce&s;s will afterwards be ea&s;y to apply the crotchet; &s;o that by pulling with it, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting with the fingers to adapt the &s;mall axis of the head to the lea&s;t diameter of the pel|vis, the extraction will be accompli&s;hed with facili|ty and &s;afety.</P>
<P>The projection of the angle of the &s;acrum towards the pubes, is by much the mo&s;t frequent mode of di&s;tortion. In &s;ome in&s;tances, the intermediate &s;pace is &s;o incon&s;iderable, that the diameter at the brim is divided, as it were, into two cavities. In this &s;pecies of di&s;tortion, it is evident, on account of the di&s;tance of, and con&s;equently difficult acce&s;s to, the pre&s;enting part of the child, that the danger in
<PB N="244" REF="022551_0234_0FB94391B29C2570">
embryulcia will be proportionably con&s;iderable: for if the narrowne&s;s at the brim proves an un&s;ur|mountable ob&s;tacle to the pa&s;&s;ing, and the figure and <HI>di&s;tortion at the bottom</HI> prevents the introduction of the hand to direct and apply the proper in&s;truments with &s;afety to the mother: in &s;uch circum&s;tances we mu&s;t either abandon the patient to utter de&s;pair, or by the la&s;t re&s;ource of de&s;ponding hope endeavour to &s;ave her.</P>
<P>It remains, then, to inquire,</P>
<P N="1">1. If dividing the bones of the pubes by the lately invented operation, affords a rea&s;onable pro&s;pect of procuring even a &s;afe delivery to the mother when it cannot be accompli&s;hed by embryulcia?</P>
<P N="2">2. Is the capacity of the pelvis, in any in&s;tance, &s;o much de&s;troyed, from di&s;tortion, that a dead child cannot be extracted by means of the &s;ci&s;&s;ars and crot|chet?</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Where the pelvis is &s;o much di&s;torted, that, the diminution of the child's head to &s;omewhat more than half of the u&s;ual &s;ize is in&s;ufficient to render deli|very practicable, SIGAULT's operation could have little effect to enable the head to pa&s;s unle&s;s its vo|lume had been previou&s;ly le&s;&s;ened. Some advantage would then be gained by dividing the bones of the pelvis; but not &s;o much as to encourage us to hope that the child would afterwards be propelled by the natural pains, or in the&s;e circum&s;tances, extracted by
<PB N="245" REF="022551_0235_0FB94393B7E5B528">
the crotchet, without employing a degree of violence which might probably be fatal to the mother.</P>
<P>Secondly, That the aperture of the pelvis is, in &s;ome ca&s;es, &s;o narrow from di&s;tortion, as to prove an un|&s;urmountable ob&s;tacle to the pa&s;&s;age of the child by embryulcia, the hi&s;tories of the Cae&s;arian &s;ection in the 4th and 5th volumes of the London E&s;&s;ays already referred to, afford &s;triking and inconte&s;tible examples.</P>
<P>In the pelvis of a woman on whom the Cae&s;arean &s;ection was performed by Dr YOUNG, late profe&s;&s;or of midwifery in the Univer&s;ity of Edinburgh, the tran&s;ver&s;e diameter at the brim does not mea&s;ure above 1&frac34; in|ches at one &s;ide; the bones of the pubes are bent, and refu&s;e admittance to a finger at the arch; the &s;a|crum is convex anteriorly; the anchylo&s;ed coccyx is angulated; and the di&s;tance from it to the tubero&s;i|ties of the i&s;chia is &s;omewhat le&s;s than 1&frac34; inches. In a pelvis of this con&s;truction, where the bottom, and indeed whole capacity, are affected by the di&s;|tortion, embryulcia could &s;carce be attempted.</P>
<P>In a collection of bones, in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, the con&s;truction of a di&s;torted pelvis of a female &s;kele|ton is &s;till more unfavourable for the operation of embryulcia than any of tho&s;e yet mentioned. The diameters at the brim are almo&s;t entirely de&s;troyed by the projection of the lumbar vertebrae and con|vexity of the &s;acrum; di&s;tance at one &s;ide from the &s;acrum to to the ilium being &frac34;ths of an inch only.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="022551_0236_0FB9439656722B88">
It is &s;ufficiently apparent, that here nothing but the Cae&s;arean &s;ection could give the patient the mo&s;t di&s;tant chance of life from the danger which threa|tened.</P>
<P>It is probable, therefore, that a faulty pelvis, who&s;e &s;malle&s;t diameter at the brim or bottom does not exceed 1&frac12; inch, or 1&frac34;, is one motive for the de&s;perate re&s;ource of the Cae&s;arean &s;ection. The difference in the &s;ize and &s;tructure of a child's head may al&s;o render it nece&s;&s;ary, where the tran&s;ver&s;e diameter of the &s;uperior aperture of the pelvis, and lateral one of the outlet, &s;omewhat exceed the dimen|&s;ions ju&s;t now mentioned.</P>
<P>Before we inquire into the practicability of the Cae|&s;arean operation with a probability that the mother will &s;urvive it, we &s;hall next endeavour to &s;how that <HI>all the other</HI> ca&s;es in which it has been perfor|med or propo&s;ed are improper indications for it.</P>
<P>II. <HI>Con&s;triction from Cicatrix, Callo&s;ity, and Tu|mors, any where about the Vagina or Os Tincae.</HI>&mdash;The vagina and os tincae are often affected with con&s;tric|tions from cicatrices, with callo&s;ities and tumors; but it is never nece&s;&s;ary to perform the Cae&s;arean &s;ection on their account. Tumors in the vagina may generally be removed with &s;afety even after the commencement of labour, and delivery happily &s;uc|ceed; or it may be &s;ometimes practicable for the ac|coucheur
<PB N="247" REF="022551_0237_0FB943986346AF78">
to pa&s;s his hand by the &s;ide of the tumor, to turn the child, and deliver. There are many in|&s;tances where, at the commencement of labour, it was impo&s;&s;ible to introduce a finger into the vagina; yet the parts have dilated as labour increa&s;ed, and the delivery terminated happily. At other times the dilatation has begun during pregnancy, and been completed before delivery. A &s;triking in&s;tance of this kind is recorded in the Mem. de l'Acad. des Scienc. 1712, of a woman who&s;e vagina was no larger than to admit a common writing quill. She had been married at &s;ixteen, and conceived eleven years after. Towards the fifth month of her preg|nancy, the vagina began to dilate, and continued to do &s;o till full time, when &s;he was &s;afely delivered.</P>

<P>Dr HARVEY relates a ca&s;e where the whole va|gina was grown together with cicatrices: nature, after a tedious labour, made the dilatation, and a large child was born.</P>
<P>M. LA MOTT<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Trait&eacute; des Accouchemens, p. 527.</NOTE> mentions his having delivered three women, who had not the &s;malle&s;t ve&s;tige of an orifice through the vagina to the uterus. Dr SIMP|SON

cut through a callo&s;ity of an os uteri which was half an inch thick<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Edinburgh Med. E&s;&s;ays, Vo. III.</NOTE>, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, tumors in the vagina, or a|bout the orificium uteri, may be &s;afely extirpated without danger of hemorrhagy or other fatal &s;ymp|toms, and the delivery will happily &s;ucceed: And, if the vagina be impervious, the os externum &s;hut up, or the labia grown together, the parts &s;hould be o|pened with a &s;calpel. If the os externum be entire|ly clo&s;ed, if the cavity of the vagina be filled up, or the pa&s;&s;age con&s;iderably ob&s;tructed by the tumors, callo|&s;ity, or con&s;triction from cicatrix, and there is no rea|&s;on to &s;u&s;pect a fault in the pelvis, of which a judg|ment may be formed by the common marks of defor|mity, under-&s;ize, or a rickety habit; it is by much the be&s;t practice to open a pa&s;&s;age through the va|gina, and deliver the woman in the ordinary way.</P>
<P>If there be no defect in the pelvis, the head of the child, or any other bulky part that pre&s;ents, will advance in this direction till it meets with a re|&s;i&s;tence in the &s;oft parts: the teguments, in that ca&s;e, will be protruded before the childs head, in form of a tumor, when a &s;imple inci&s;ion downwards to the perinaeum, in the direction of the axis vaginae will remove the cau&s;e of difficulty, by relieving the head; the child will afterwards &s;afely pa&s;s, and the wound will heal without any bad con&s;equence.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="022551_0239_0FB9439DB21C00C0">
When there is any defect in the &s;oft parts, which prevents the acce&s;s of the finger into the vagina, the head of the child may be readily felt, and the &s;tate of the parts in &s;ome degree judged of by the introduction of a finger into the anus.</P>
<P>III. <HI>Lacerated Uterus</HI> is another cau&s;e, for which this operation has been recommended. The uterus may be ruptured from the cro&s;s pre&s;entation of the child in time of pregnancy, when the uterine fibres do not readily yield to the di&s;tending cau&s;e, or from mechanical violence in attempting delivery. The&s;e ca&s;es are generally fatal; and the life of the mother can &s;eldom be &s;aved by the Cae&s;arean &s;ection, after the foetus e&s;capes through the torn uterus into the cavity of the abdomen; becau&s;e inflammation and &s;phacelus have generally affected the parts of the uterus that &s;u&s;tained the pre&s;&s;ure, previous to the rupture; if otherwi&s;e, convul&s;ions or other fatal &s;ymptoms &s;oon en&s;ue, from the quantity of blood, waters, &amp;c. poured into the cavity of the abdomen.</P>
<P>When the child cannot be extracted by the natural pa&s;&s;ages, tremors, &s;ingultus, cold &s;weats, &s;yncope, and the death of the mother, for the mo&s;t part &s;o quickly follow, that it will at lea&s;t &s;eem doubtful to a humane practitioner, how far it would be advi&s;able, after &s;o dreadful an accident, the woman apparently in the ag|onies of death, ra&s;hly to perform another dangerous
<PB N="250" REF="022551_0240_0FB9439F298662E8">
operation, even with a view to pre&s;erve the child, before he had waited till the mother recruits or ex|pires.</P>
<P>If part of the child be contained within the uterus and the feet can be reached the be&s;t practice is to de-deliver by the orifice of the womb. When the whole foetus has e&s;caped entirely without the uterus, the Cae&s;arean operation is recommended as the only means of pre&s;erving both mother and child.</P>
<P>But if the operation on this occa&s;ion be ever allow|able, it may be a&s;ked,</P>
<P N="1">1. At what time &s;hould it be performed?</P>
<P N="2">2. Would it not have the appearance of inhuma|nity, to have recour&s;e to this expedient immediately after the uterus bur&s;ts, when the woman is &s;eemingly ready to expire, although it be the only time when there is a chance of &s;aving the child?</P>
<P N="3">3. In mo&s;t ca&s;es where this accident happens, &s;hould the Cae&s;arean &s;ection be made, it is not highly improbable that the mother will &s;urvive &s;o terrible a laceration? At lea&s;t the uncertainty how long &s;he may &s;urvive it, &s;eems a con&s;iderable ob&s;tacle to the opera|tion under &s;uch di&s;agreeable circum&s;tances; <HI>ne occidi&s;&s;e videatur, quem &s;ors interemit.</HI></P>
<P>IV. <HI>Ventral Conception</HI> is a fourth indication for this operation, The&s;e are either in the ovaria, tubes, or ca|vity of the abdomen, and &s;eldom arrive at great &s;ize; or are retained, often for a great many years, with|out
<PB N="251" REF="022551_0241_0FB943A0A328D2F0">
occa&s;ioning much complaint. The i&s;&s;ue of the&s;e conceptions has al&s;o been no le&s;s various than extra|ordinary: for, after having been long retained in an indolent &s;tate, ab&s;ce&s;&s;es or ulcerations have formed, and they have been di&s;charged through all the diffe|rent parts of the abdomen<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vid.</HI> Mangeti Bibliothec. Medicin.; Journal De Scavans; Memoir. de l'Acad. des Sciences; Chapman's Midwifery; London Medical Ob&s;ervations; Dr Duncan's Medical Commen|taries, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t women feel pain and violent motion towards the term of ordinary delivery, in the&s;e ca&s;es of ven|tral conception; if, therefore, the operation be ever nece&s;&s;ary, then is the proper time to perform it. But in general, as the &s;eparation of extra-uterine foetu&s;es from their involucra may occa&s;ion imme|diate death in many ca&s;es, in con&s;equence of the va&s;t haemorrhagy that might en&s;ue from the non|contractile power of the parts to which they adhere; unle&s;s they point outwardly, or excite violent &s;ymp|toms, their expul&s;ion &s;hould be univer&s;ally tru&s;ted to nature.</P>
<P>V. <HI>Herniae of the Uterus</HI> are never &s;ufficient indi|cations to induce us to perform the Cae&s;arean &s;ec|tion, as the uterus is very rarely influenced in &s;uch a manner, that the orifice cannot be reached, and the delivery &s;ucce&s;sfully made. Many in&s;tances are to be found among Surgical authors, where deliveries, under &s;uch circum&s;tances, have been happily performed,
<PB N="252" REF="022551_0242_0FB943A324137940">
without having recour&s;e to &s;o hazardous an expedient. MAURICEAU mentions a ca&s;e, where the uterus in a ventral hernia was pu&s;hed along with the inte&s;tines a|bove the belly, and contained in a tumor of a prodi|gious &s;ize; the woman, however, was delivered at the end of her time in the ordinary way. M. LA MOTTE relates the hi&s;tory of a woman in a pre|ternatural labour, who&s;e uterus and child hang down pendulous to the middle of her thigh; but whom notwith&s;tanding, he &s;afely delivered. And Dr RUYSCH gives a ca&s;e, where the midwife reduced the hernia before delivery, although it was prolap|&s;ed as far as the knee, the delivery was &s;afely perform|ed, and the woman had a good recovery.</P>
<P><HI>The Po&s;ition or Bulk of the Child.</HI>&mdash;Since the prac|tice of turning the child and delivering by the feet, and the late improvement of ob&s;tetrical in&s;truments, this operation has never been performed on account of po&s;ition, mon&s;tro&s;ity, or any other ob&s;tacle on the part of the child merely. It will be obvious, how|ever, that the increa&s;ed bulk of the foetus combined with di&s;torted pelvis, will render the delivery propor|tionally difficult and dangerous: and though we may, from a concurrence of fortunate circum&s;tances be enabled to perform the extraction by embryulcia in a pelvis &s;omewhat le&s;s than the dimen&s;ions menti|oned in Dr KELLIE's ca&s;e formerly referred to<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> page 322.</NOTE>,
<PB N="253" REF="022551_0243_0FB943A469657D08">
the difference in the bulk of the child may render it impracticable where the aperture of the pelvis &s;ome|what exceeds it.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, when, by a careful men&s;uration with the fingers, the pelvis appears to be faulty to &s;uch a degreee as to refu&s;e pa&s;&s;age to the dimini&s;hed &s;ize of the child's head by embryulcia, and there is no pro&s;pect of accompli&s;hing delivery by the new opera|tion of dividing the &s;ymphy&s;is pubis by inci&s;ion; in other words, when it appears ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible to deliver the woman by any other means, which is to be determined by a con&s;ultation of experienced prac|titioners; we ought <HI>then only</HI> to employ the dreadful expedient of cutting into the uterus to extract the child.</P>
<P>That this operation, frightful and hazardous as it mo&s;t certainly is, has actually been performed with &s;ucce&s;s in a variety of ca&s;es, the writings of &s;everal authors of character afford the mo&s;t unque&s;tionable evidence<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See the authors already quoted.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>We have rea&s;on, however, to &s;u&s;pect, that the facts related in tho&s;e hi&s;tories have been mi&s;repre&s;ent|ed, or the event of the operation in Great Britain ought not to have been &s;o univer&s;ally fatal.

Some time after her recovery, &s;he was irregular; afterwards had one &s;how of the men&s;es; again conceived; and the child, as &s;he imagined, arrived at full time. She was attacked, on Monday the 3d January 1774, about mid|night, with labour-pains; which went on &s;lowly, gradually in|crea&s;ing till Saturday the 15th, when &s;he was brought from the country to the Royal Infirmary here. Upon examination, the pelvis &s;eemed con&s;iderably di&s;torted; but the body was otherwi&s;e well &s;haped, tho' of &s;mall &s;ize. The os externum vaginae was en|tirely &s;hut up; nor could any ve&s;tige of vagina be ob&s;erved, nor any appearance of labia pudendorum: In&s;tead of the&s;e, there was a &s;mall aperture at the &s;uperior part of the vulva, immediately, under the mons veneri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, probably about the middle anterior part of the &s;ymphy&s;is pubis. This aperture (which had a &s;mall proce&s;s on the &s;uperior part, &s;omewhat re&s;embling the clitoris) was no larger than ju&s;t to allow the introduction of a finger; the meatus urinari<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s lay concealed within it. A con&s;ultation of Surgeons was called, and the Cae&s;arean &s;ection was determined on. Having had no &s;tool nor voided any urine for two days, an injection was attempted to be thrown up; but it did not pa&s;s, nor was it po&s;|&s;ible to pu&s;h the female catheter into the bladder. At <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ix in the evening, the operator made an inci&s;ion on the left &s;ide of the ab|domen in the ordinary way, through the integuments, till the peritonaeum was expo&s;ed; two &s;mall arteries &s;prung, which were &s;oon &s;topped by a &s;light compre&s;&s;ion: the wound was then continued through the peritonaeum into the cavity of the ab|domen; when the bladder appeared &s;lightly inflamed, and much di&s;tended, reaching with its fundus near as far as the &s;crobiculus cordis. Another un&s;ucce&s;sful attempt was made to pa&s;s the fe|male catheter: at length a male catheter was procured, which was, after &s;ome difficulty, introduced into the bladder; and the urine evacuated to the quantity of four pounds, high &s;melled and fetid. This occa&s;ioned a nece&s;&s;ary interruption, for a few mi|nutes, between making the opening into the abdomen and uterus; the bladder collap&s;ing, the uterus, which before lay concealed, now came in view; through which an inci&s;ion was made, and a &s;tout male child was extracted alive; and immediately afterwards the &s;ecundines. The uterus contracted rapidly. After clean&s;ing the wound, the lips were brought together by the quill-&s;uture, and dre&s;&s;ed &s;uperficially. The patient &s;upported the operation with &s;urpri&s;ing courage and re&s;olution; and no more than five or &s;ix ounces of blood were lo&s;t on the occa&s;ion.</P><P>Being laid in bed, &s;he complained of &s;ickne&s;s, and had a &s;light fit of vomiting; but, by means of an anodyne, the&s;e &s;ymptoms &s;oon abated. She was affected with univer&s;al coldne&s;s over her body; which al&s;o abated, on the application of warm irons to the feet. She then became ea&s;y, and &s;lept for four or five hours. Next morning, the 16th, about two o'clock, &s;he complained of con&s;iderable pain in the oppo&s;ite &s;ide: for which &s;he was blooded, and an injection was given, but without effect; for the pain in|crea&s;ed, &s;tretching from the right &s;ide to the &s;crobiculus cordis; nor did fomentations &s;eem to relieve her: her pul&s;e became fre|quent, &s;he was hot, and complained of drought. At 7 A. M. the injection was repeated, but with no better &s;ucce&s;s; and eight ounces more of blood were taken from the arm. A third injection &s;till failed to evacuate any faeces; the drought increa&s;ed; and the pul&s;e ro&s;e to 128 &s;trokes in a minute. At 11 A. M. the pul&s;e became fuller, and the re&s;piration much oppre&s;&s;ed. No &s;tool nor urine pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince the operation. At 12 &s;he was blooded a|gain, when the &s;izine&s;s appeared le&s;s than formerly. She now took a &s;olution of &s;al Glauberi, manna and cr. tart&punc; at &s;hort in|tervals; &s;he vomited a little after the la&s;t do&s;e, had a &s;oft &s;tool, and voided a &s;mall quantity of urine. At 3 P. M. her pul&s;e was 136; and &s;he had another &s;tool, when thin faeces were evacuated: &s;he was then ordered two &s;poonfuls of a cordial anodyne mix|ture every &s;econd hour. The vomiting now abated; the pul&s;e became &s;maller and more frequent: &s;he pa&s;&s;ed urine freely; but the pain and oppre&s;&s;ed breathing increa&s;ed. At 7 P. M. her pul&s;e ro&s;e to 142, and became weak and fluttering; &s;he called for bread, and &s;wallowed a little with &s;ome difficulty; her drought was inten&s;e; the dy&s;pnoea &s;till increa&s;ed. She was now much op|pre&s;&s;ed, began to to&s;s; the pul&s;e &s;unk, and became impercepti|ble: &s;he complained of fainti&s;hne&s;s; but on belching wind, her breathing was relieved, and the pul&s;e returned, growing fuller and &s;tronger.

<P>Why, therefore, &s;hould a recent wound through the teguments, peritonaeum, and uterus, be fatal in almo&s;t every in&s;tance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>About four years ago, in a ca&s;e where the &s;houlder of the child had pre&s;ented in an oblique direction at the brim of the pel|vis, the labour had been permitted to go on from the morning to the afternoon; the midwife had mi&s;taken the pre&s;enting part for the breech; and the pains, after a few hours, became &s;o &s;trong and forcing, that &s;he expected the child to be propelled with every throe. The patient &s;oon after became re&s;tle&s;s; to&s;|&s;ing and delirium en&s;ued.</P><P>In this &s;ituation I was called in. When the patient was proper|ly &s;ecured by a&s;&s;i&s;tants, I pa&s;&s;ed up my hand with difficulty, and di&s;covered a con&s;iderable rent in the uterus towards the &s;uperior lateral part of the cervix, through which the &s;houlder and arm of the child had e&s;caped into the cavity of the abdomen. Every at|tempt to in&s;inuate the hand &s;o high as to reach one or both feet, with a view to bring them down and deliver, brought on an im|petuous gu&s;h of blood. I was therefore obliged to deliver with the crotchet; and more readily adopted this method, as there was little rea&s;on to expect, from the hi&s;tory of the ca&s;e, that the child was alive; it really appeared to have died the day before. After the feet and body were extracted, the fir&s;t arm was readily relieved; but, in bringing down the other, though every po&s;&s;ible precaution was employed, the wound in the uterus was increa&s;ed downwards to the very edge of the os tincae.</P><P>The placenta was removed by the introduction of the hand in|to the uterus, on account of flooding; and &s;ome portion of inte&s;|tine reduced, which had been forced through the wound of the u|terus, and protruded at the vagina almo&s;t as far as the os exter|num. This gave me an opportunity of examining the rupture, which I found already amazingly dimini&s;hed by the contraction of the uterus.</P><P>I gave the patient an opiate, and took my leave; not expecting again to have &s;een her in life. She &s;l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">pt comfortably that night; complained for a few days of an unea&s;y &s;en&s;ation like after-pains; on the fifth day matter in con&s;iderable quantity appeared on the cloths at the pudendum, but without much pain. The di&s;charge gradually le&s;&s;ened, and her recovery otherwi&s;e was nearly as good as if no extraordinary accident had happened.</P></NOTE>?</P>

<P>He therefore has propo&s;ed, for twelve years pa&s;t, in his Lectures, <Q>that, in performing the Cae&s;arean operation, we &s;hould be careful that the vi&s;cera be expo&s;ed as little as po&s;&s;ible; and that the &s;ides of the wound &s;hould be kept contiguous by a greater number of &s;titches than are commonly employed

<P>The particular method of performing the operation is de&s;cribed &s;o &s;atisfactorily by Dr MONRO, our learned and accurate Profe&s;&s;or, in his Lectures, that we &s;hall take the liberty to in&s;ert his own words.</P>
<Q><P>By this operation is under&s;tood, an inci&s;ion made fir&s;t into the cavity of the abdomen, and then into the uterus, in order to extract a foetus. If the per&s;on on whom we are to perform it has been killed by an accident in the la&s;t month of pregnancy, or has died of a fever, we need not be very exact about the inci&s;ion, but mu&s;t make it as quickly as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>If, however, we are to operate on a living per|&s;on, we ought not to attempt the operation if &s;he has ever on any former occa&s;ion been delivered of a child; for that is a &s;ure proof that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> opening is &s;ufficiently large<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The ca&s;e of the Cae&s;arean operation mentioned in the Lon|don Medical Ob&s;ervations and Inquiries, Vol. V. is an exception to the general rule; but examples of this kind very rarely occur.</NOTE>.

operation performed, which is attended with the mo&s;t imminent danger.</P>
<P>Next, we ought &s;trictly to examine the &s;tate of the bones and of the &s;oft parts, le&s;t we imagine that the bones prevent the delivery; when, per|haps, the &s;oft parts only may be in the fault. We may al&s;o pre&s;ume, that there is a &s;ufficient wide|ne&s;s in the bones of the pelvis if the patient is not ob&s;erved to have deformity in the other parts of the body, as a deformity rarely occurs in the pelvis without rickets or a curvature in the &s;pine; though in a few ca&s;es this may happen. But, after all the&s;e circum&s;tances have been attended to, and the operation is determined, next let us con&s;ider the proper &s;teps to be taken in it.</P>
<P>We fir&s;t empty the inte&s;tines, the rectum, and ve&s;ica urinaria, that the patient may not be di&s;turb|ed too &s;oon after the operation, and that the &s;ize of the bladder may not interrupt it. We then lay the patient in a horizontal po&s;ture, that the inte&s;|tines be not pu&s;hed down between the abdominal integuments and uterus. In making the inci&s;ion, we mu&s;t avoid the large arteries in the containing parts. If it were to be extended far outwards, con&s;iderable branches of the circumflex might be divided; if inwards, the epiga&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">: &s;o the be&s;t place is between the r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">cti mu&s;cles, or upon the out&s;ide of the rectus. The la&s;t place is mo&s;t fre|quently
<PB N="262" REF="022551_0252_0FB943BA33B53E60">
preferred, and we there readily get into the uterus. By this means, indeed, the uterus mu&s;t be divided towards its &s;ide, where the ve&s;&s;els enter and are mo&s;t con&s;iderable; but we choo&s;e the out&s;ide of the rectus, becau&s;e of the ve&s;ica urinaria being in danger of contracting inflammation from the inci&s;ion. Except the danger of wounding the &s;mall turns of the inte&s;tines, there is no great diffi|culty in performing the operation; yet &s;everal cautions are to be ob&s;erved. Operators have not been aware of the cau&s;es of the danger; and we have more favourable accounts of the operation than we ought to have. We &s;hall find in practice, that we &s;hall be more frequently di&s;appointed than we would imagine from the reports of authors who have only mentioned the fortunate ca&s;es. In this city the operation has been performed five times, and always without &s;ucce&s;s; tho' &s;ome of the women, before the operation, were in ordinary health. The great danger, I am per&s;uaded, ari&s;es from the admi&s;&s;ion of the air, as well as from the parts divided; and I have repeatedly found, in making experiments upon animals, that if the air were let in upon the abdominal bowels for a few mi|nutes, without any farther injury, the animal often dies, and always recovers with the utmo&s;t difficulty: And this &s;till more readily happens if a con&s;iderable quantity of red blood be extrava&s;ated
<PB N="263" REF="022551_0253_0FB943BBACDDCF30">
within the cavity, which produces a mo&s;t violent inflammation. Therefore the &s;urgeon is not to go at once into the cavity of the abdomen; but &s;hould fir&s;t divide the &s;kin and mu&s;cles, and leave the pe|ritonaeum entire until the bleeding from the ve&s;&s;els has entirely cea&s;ed: the danger in that way, I find is very much le&s;&s;ened. We then open the perito|naeum, making fir&s;t a &s;mall inci&s;ion, and ob&s;erve if the uterus is contiguous: if it is, we divide it with caution; and the a&s;&s;i&s;tant, by making a mo|derate pre&s;&s;ure, hinders the air from getting into the general cavity of the abdomen. The di&s;charge of blood from the uterus is &s;maller than we would expect. We then cut the membranes, &s;eparate the placenta to extract the foetus, di&s;charge the waters; and, as &s;oon as the foetus and fecundines are removed, the uterus contracts of it&s;elf. Then let the &s;urgeon pa&s;s his hand into the cavity of the uterus, and with one or two fingers open the os uteri, that the blood, naturally di&s;charging into the cavity of the uterus from the wound, may pa&s;s readily out by the vagina. We then &s;hut the wound; and, in&s;tead or leaving an opening for the di&s;charge of matter, we tru&s;t to ab&s;orption; for I con&s;tantly find, that a very clo&s;e &s;uture contributes to the cure; &s;o I would &s;ew the containing parts of the abdomen with the glover's &s;titch, or inter|rupted &s;utures at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">hs of an inch di&s;tance, making

<HEAD>CHAP. III. PRETERNATURAL LABOURS.</HEAD>
<P>LABOURS are &s;tyled <HI>Preternatural,</HI> <Q>when any part of the child's body, except the head, pre&s;ents, or is fir&s;t felt by the finger, at the mouth of the womb.</Q></P>
<P>We have already &s;aid, that, in the mo&s;t natural po&s;ition, the top of the head pre&s;ents; but the feet and breech often fir&s;t appear, and the child is deli|vered in that manner.

<P>The cau&s;es of preternatural labours probably are,</P>
<P>The motion and &s;tirrings of the foetus, either na|turally, or from &s;hocks affecting the mother. For,

in the early months, the foetus having once altered its po&s;ition, may be prevented from recovering it by folds of the chord round its body and limbs; and, in advanced ge&s;tation, if the breech &s;hould get under|mo&s;t in&s;tead of the head, the child will with difficulty be re&s;tored to its proper po&s;ition, as the quantity of water is con&s;tantly decrea&s;ing, and the chi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> beco|ming more bulky.</P>
<P>The po&s;ition of the child in the womb may be al&s;o influenced by its particular figure and con&s;truc|tion; the quantity of &s;urrounding water, the length of the chord, the manner of &s;tretching of the womb, the &s;hape of the ba&s;in, and a variety of other circum|&s;tances.</P>
<P>We can &s;ometimes di&s;cover that the child pre&s;ents in an unfavourable po&s;ition, even when the labour is but little advanced.&mdash;We &s;u&s;pect it,

<P>CASE I.</P>
<P>THE &s;imple&s;t and ea&s;ie&s;t ca&s;e of preternatural la|bour is &s;uppo&s;ed to be, <HI>when the child pre&s;ents with the feet:</HI> but there is &s;ometimes danger le&s;t the head &s;hould be retained after the delivery of the body, which is le&s;s when the child pre&s;ents double; though, even in that po&s;ition, a fir&s;t child frequently lo&s;es its life.</P>
<P>We are often able to di&s;cern the pre&s;enting part long before the membranes break, and it is of great
<PB N="268" REF="022551_0258_0FB943C34FF140C8">
con&s;equence to di&s;cover early how the child lies; but, in making the nece&s;&s;ary examination, care mu&s;t be taken not to pre&s;s the finger again&s;t the mem|branes in time of a pain. When the pre&s;enting part is at a di&s;tance, or the po&s;ition of the child appears doubtful or ob&s;cure, the woman &s;hould be &s;hifted from her &s;ide to her back, examined in a &s;itting po|&s;ture at the pubes where the pelvis is &s;hallow, or on her knees. A hand is often mi&s;taken for a foot; but the latter may be readily di&s;tingui&s;hed from the for|mer by the weight and re&s;i&s;tance it gives to the touch, by the &s;hortne&s;s of the toes, and the length of the heel.</P>
<P><HI>When one or both feet pre&s;ent in the pa&s;&s;age,</HI> little more ought to be done than if the labour were &s;trict|ly natural, till the orifice of the womb be &s;uf|ficiently dilated, and the pre&s;enting part advanced at or without the os externum. The woman mu&s;t then be placed either on her &s;ide, with the breech o|ver the edge of the bed, and her head obliquely to the oppo&s;ite &s;ide; or, on her back cro&s;s the bed, &s;up|ported by an a&s;&s;i&s;tant in the bed to rai&s;e her head and &s;houlders, and an a&s;&s;i&s;tant at either &s;ide of the bed on a low &s;eat, who&s;e office is to &s;ecure the woman's feet, to &s;eparate her knees, and prevent her from &s;hifting. When any difficulty in extracting the head may be &s;u&s;pected, or when the practitioner is not very dexterous in the art, the latter po&s;ture is pre|ferable. It is al&s;o, in general, for young practiti|oners,
<PB N="269" REF="022551_0259_0FB943C4E6B393D8">
the be&s;t po&s;ition, in all tho&s;e ca&s;es where it is nece&s;&s;ary to pa&s;s the hand into the uterus, to make the delivery by turning the child.</P>
<P>When the parts are thus &s;ufficiently open, or the feet, by the force of repeated pains, at, or protruded without, the orifice of the vagina, the operator may then take hold, fir&s;t of one leg, gra&s;ping it firm|ly above the ankle, and gently endeavouring to pull it down in the time of a pain, not in a &s;traight line, but from &s;ide to &s;ide, or from pubes to &s;acrum; when the pain remits a warm cloth is to be applied to the os externum, and the return of the pain &s;hould be waited for. The other leg is then to be taken hold of and pulled down in the &s;ame gradual gentle manner with the former: by pulling alternately fir&s;t by one foot then by the other, there is le&s;s ha|zard of injuring the uterus, than if an attempt were made to bring down both feet at once; and the pa&s;|&s;ages, being thus gradually &s;tretched, will be better prepared for the delivery of the bulky &s;houlders and head.</P>
<P>When the feet are &s;ufficiently advanced for it, a warm cloth &s;hould be wrapped round them; which will enable the operator to take a firmer hold, and defend the child from the hazard of injury by the ex|traction. But the cloth &s;hould be &s;o applied as to leave the toes expo&s;ed; for they are the proper direction for turning body. If they already point to the &s;acrum, the
<PB N="270" REF="022551_0260_0FB943C634179A10">
child is to be brought along in the &s;ame direction, till it &s;tops from the re&s;i&s;tance of the &s;houlders. But if, in&s;tead of pointing backwards, the toes &s;hould point to the &s;ide or belly, the child's body mu&s;t be gradual|ly turned, till the belly be applied to the back of the mother, and the back of the child to the mother's pubes.</P>
<P>The proper time to begin to turn, is a little before the breech advances to the os externum. The turn &s;hould not be made all at once, but gradually; the child's body mu&s;t be firmly gra&s;ped with both hands, pu&s;hing a little upwards, then turning to one &s;ide in time of the pain, carefully ob&s;erving and favour|ing that line of direction which the child naturally inclines to take. The attempt mu&s;t be repeated du|ring every pain, till the child's body be turned round, and the face applied to the &s;acrum of the mother. The motions of the child's head and body do not al|ways exactly corre&s;pond. Therefore, after the bel|ly of the child pre&s;&s;es again&s;t the perinaeum of the mother, a quarter-turn extraordinary is &s;till nece&s;&s;a|ry, which mu&s;t again be rever&s;ed before the operator begins to extract. By that means the arm will be prevented from getting under the face, the broad &s;houlders will be applied to the wide&s;t diameter of the pelvis, the face will be turned towards the angle of the &s;acrum, and readily follow in that direction.</P>
<P>When the breech is entirely protruded without
<PB N="271" REF="022551_0261_0FB943C954BF18A0">
the os externum, the child mu&s;t be taken hold of by gra&s;ping firmly with the thumbs above the haun|ches, and the fingers &s;pread over the groins; the extraction mu&s;t be gradually performed, moving from &s;ide to &s;ide, pre&s;&s;ing a litlte downwards to|wards the perinaeum, and waiting for natural pains, or re&s;ting from time to time. As the belly ad|vances, the operator mu&s;t &s;lide up his hand, or two fingers, and very gently draw down a little the um|bilical cord, le&s;t, being ten&s;e and over&s;tretched, the circulation might be interrupted, and the life of the child de&s;troyed, which often happens where this pre|caution is neglected.</P>
<P>After the breech is protruded, and the navel-&s;tring begins to be compre&s;&s;ed, from the os tincae gra&s;ping it like a ring, the delivery mu&s;t be conducted with all the expedition that the mother's &s;afety will ad|mit of. When the child is advanced as far as the brea&s;t, its farther progre&s;s is prevented by the arms going up by the &s;ides of the head. This ob&s;tacle mu&s;t be removed in this manner: The child's body ought to be &s;upported by the left-hand of the opera|tor, which mu&s;t be pa&s;&s;ed under the brea&s;t of the child, in &s;uch a manner that the child, may re&s;t on the palm and arm of that hand; the child mu&s;t then be drawn a little to one &s;ide, that two or more fingers of the right-hand may be pa&s;&s;ed at the op|po&s;ite &s;ide into the pelvis, over the back of the
<PB N="272" REF="022551_0262_0FB943CAAACB71C0">
&s;houlder, as far as the elbow, to bring down the arm obliquely along the brea&s;t, gently bending it at the fore-arm, in &s;uch a manner as to favour the natural motions of the joint. Having then &s;hifted hands, the other arm mu&s;t be di&s;engaged, and brought down in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>Both arms of the child being relieved, the wo|man may be allowed to re&s;t a little till another pain or two follow; when, by bearing down in the time of the pain, the head will generally be forced down and delivered. But, if the woman be much exhau|&s;ted, and the head does not quickly follow, the child will be lo&s;t from the pre&s;&s;ure of the navel-&s;tring.</P>
<P>The pul&s;ation of the arteries in the chord &s;hould regulate the time for extracting the head: while the pul&s;ation is &s;trong, there is no hazard from delay; if the pul&s;ation be weak or languid, more e&s;pecially if the chord begins to be cold and flaccid, the extrac|tion mu&s;t be quickly performed, otherwi&s;e the child will be de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>The extraction of the head in preternatural labours, is often the mo&s;t difficult and dangerous part of the delivery. The cau&s;e of re&s;i&s;tance, when it does not advance, is chiefly owing to its confinement between the &s;acrum and pubes, when the bulky part of the head is detained at the brim, or at the lower part, by the chin catching on the &s;acro-&s;ciatic liga|ments. The method of delivery is to introduce two

fingers of the right-hand (which hand and arm at the &s;ame time mu&s;t &s;upport the body of the child) into the mouth, and pull down the jaw towards the brea&s;t; then applying the other hand with the fingers &s;pread, &s;o as to pre&s;s down the &s;houlders, the operator mu&s;t ri&s;e from his &s;eat, and pull in a direction from pubes to &s;acrum with con&s;iderable force, alternately rai&s;ing and depre&s;&s;ing the head till it begins to yield, &s;o that, the chin being con&s;tantly pre&s;&s;ed to the brea&s;t, the face will de&s;cend from the hollow of the &s;acrum: the delivery mu&s;t then be fini&s;hed, by bringing the hind-head from under the pubes with a half-round turn.</P>
<P>During the&s;e efforts, an a&s;&s;i&s;tant mu&s;t be directed to pre&s;s on the perinaeum; and, whenever the cir|cum&s;tances of the ca&s;e will admit of it, the exertions of the operator &s;hould coincide with the natural throes of labour, by which the extraction will be greatly facilitated.</P>
<P>If the po&s;ition be unfavourable, the face, if po&s;&s;i|ble, &s;hould be turned towards the &s;acrum, by pu&s;h|ing up the head, or by pre&s;&s;ing on the chin; if the mouth cannot be reached, the pre&s;&s;ure &s;hould be made any where on the lower-jaw; if the difficulty ari&s;es from the folds of the chord round the legs, thighs, body, or neck of the child, the&s;e mu&s;t be di&s;|engaged in the ea&s;ie&s;t manner po&s;&s;ible. The contrac|tion of the orificium uteri round the child's neck

rarely proves the cau&s;e of the re&s;i&s;tance, except when the feet are pulled down too early, or in premature labours, when it may be gently &s;tretched with the fingers, and further endeavours &s;hould be delayed for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>If the head does not yield after repeated efforts, in the manner directed, there is a nece&s;&s;ity for re&s;ting &s;ome time; as the head does not &s;o &s;oon collap&s;e, and mould it&s;elf to the pa&s;&s;age, in preternatural as in natural pre&s;entations. Whatever ob&s;tacle prevents it from advancing, it will &s;till be prudent to re&s;t for a little; and, after a proper interval, renew our ex|ertions by thus alternately re&s;ting, and attempting to extract, the head will yield, and the child may be &s;a|ved, after a con&s;iderable exertion of force has been u&s;ed.</P>
<P>If the cau&s;e of re&s;i&s;tance appears to be the extraor|dinary bulk of the head from hydrocephalus, the te|guments may be bur&s;ted by the the force of pulling, by thru&s;ting a finger through them, or by perforating the cranium with the long &s;ci&s;&s;ars.</P>
<P>If by the violent exertions employed, there is ha|zard of di&s;locating the cervical vertebrae, and &s;epara|ting the body from the head, the operator mu&s;t cau|tiou&s;ly de&s;i&s;t from pulling, and wait for the con|tractions of the uterus, employing his exertions du|ring the time of pains only.</P>

very faulty, the former mu&s;t be opened with the &s;ci&s;|&s;ars at the ba&s;is of the &s;kull, and the extraction after|wards performed with the crotchet.</P>
<P>The fingers of the operator introduced into the mouth, or pre&s;&s;ing on the upper or lower-jaw, will be &s;ufficient to accompli&s;h the extraction of the head where there is no great di&s;proportion between it and the pelvis; &s;o that the forceps will &s;eldom be nece&s;|&s;ary.

<P>Ca&s;e 5. <HI>The Breech.</HI></P>
<P>The varieties of the breech are,

<ITEM>2<HI>dly,</HI> To the &s;acrum;</ITEM>
<ITEM>3<HI>dly,</HI> To either &s;ide.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Sometimes the po&s;ition of the breech may be di&s;|covered before the membranes break; but after|wards with more certainty, by the meconium of the child accompanying the waters; and by feeling the buttocks, thighs, or genitals of the child to the touch.</P>
<P>In whatever manner the breech pre&s;ents, the de|livery &s;hould be &s;ubmitted to nature, till the child be advanced &s;o far, that the feet can be laid hold of and brought down. If the fore-parts of the child be already placed towards the &s;acrum of the mother, no|thing el&s;e is nece&s;&s;ary but to &s;upport the child till it advances &s;o low, by the force of the natural pains, that the feet can be readily and &s;afely brought down.</P>
<P>If the fore-parts of the child be placed anteriorly or laterally to the mother, when the child is &s;o far advanced that it can be laid hold of and wrapped in a cloth, the mechanical turns mu&s;t be made, and the delivery fini&s;hed, as directed in footling-ca&s;es.</P>
<P>There is much le&s;s hazard, in general, in allow|ing
<PB N="277" REF="022551_0267_0FB943D6C6681F18">
the child to advance double, than in precipita|ting the extraction, by pu&s;hing up to bring down the feet, before the parts have been &s;ufficiently dilated: a practice difficult and trouble&s;ome to the operator; painful, and &s;ometimes dangerous to the mother; and by which the child is expo&s;ed to the ri&s;k of &s;tran|gulation, from the retention of the head after the de|livery of the body. If the child be &s;mall, though doubled, it will ea&s;ily pa&s;s in that direction; if large, though the labour &s;hould be painful, the natural throes are le&s;s violent and dangerous than the pain occa&s;ioned, fir&s;t, by introducing the hand with a view to turn; and, 2dly, by pu&s;hing up the child in order to lay hold of the feet and bring them down. If the child advances naturally, it will be le&s;s expo|&s;ed to &s;uffer; if it &s;hould not advance, there is this advantage, that the parts of the mother will be pro|perly prepared, when the &s;trong pains are abated, for pa&s;&s;ing the hand into the pelvis, to rai&s;e up the breech, &s;earch for the feet, bring down one or both, and deliver.</P>
<P>The propriety of this mode of treatment is &s;upport|ed by the pains being often &s;tronger in breech-ca&s;es than in natural labour; but it cannot be followed when the mother is weak, and the pains are trifling; when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he is affected with floodings or convul&s;ions; when the child is of a very large &s;ize, or the pelvis narrow; when the umblical chord falls down, and
<PB N="278" REF="022551_0268_0FB943D83464FAA8">
is compre&s;&s;ed between the thighs of the child, or be|tween the child and the pelvis, and cannot be redu|ced above the pre&s;enting part.</P>
<P>The prolap&s;us of the navel-&s;tring generally ac|companies that po&s;ition of the breech, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he child pre&s;ents with its fore-parts to the belly of the mother. Sometimes the chord can be reduced, and the child's life pre&s;erved: but, if the breech be far advanced, and the pains &s;trong, it is not only difficult, but ha|zardous, to pu&s;h up the child; who can &s;eldom, in &s;uch circum&s;tances, be pre&s;erved. It is better, therefore, to let the child come as it will, if there are pains, rather than hazard the more important life of the mother by attempting to pu&s;h up and turn it. But, in all doubtful and perplexing ca&s;es, when there is time for it, the advice of a more &s;kilful practi|tioner ought to be taken.</P>
<P>When the breech is &s;o far advanced, that a finger or two can be pa&s;&s;ed under the bended thigh, as far as the groin of the child, a&s;&s;i&s;tance may be given with advantage, by alternately pulling, fir&s;t at one &s;ide, then at the other, in time of the pain. But great care ought to be taken not to mi&s;take the &s;houlder for the breech, and not to injure the child by violent pulling, or unequal pre&s;&s;ure. Such errors have often been commmitted, and the con&s;equences have been fatal.</P>
<P>In breech-ca&s;es, the greate&s;t caution is nece&s;&s;ary,
<PB N="279" REF="022551_0269_0FB943DA56C0C888">
when the genital parts pre&s;ent, le&s;t the child &s;hould be injured by too frequent touching.</P>

<HEAD>CLASS II. When the Child lies cro&s;s in a rounded or oval form, with the Arm, Shoulder, Side, back, or Belly, pre&s;enting.</HEAD>
<P>IN the former cla&s;s, though the birth may &s;ome|times, when the child is &s;mall, be accompli&s;hed without manual a&s;&s;i&s;tance; when the child lies acro&s;s, no force of pain can make it advance in that po&s;ition; and without proper aid, both mother and child would peri&s;h.</P>
<P>If a &s;kilful practitioner hath the management of the labour from the beginning, the child may gene|rally be turned, in the wor&s;t po&s;ition, without much difficulty: but, when the waters have been for &s;ome time evacuated, and the uterus is &s;trongly contracted round the child's body, turning will be difficult and laborious to the operator; painful, and even dange|rous, to the mother. For it ought to be con&s;idered, that the great difficulty and hazard of turning, are chiefly owing to the re&s;i&s;tance which the uterus gives; not &s;o much to the po&s;ition of the foetus. When the water, in whole, or in part, is retained, there is ea&s;y acce&s;s to reach the feet and bring them down; but, in proportion as the water is evacuated, the ute|rine cavity becomes le&s;s &s;pacious, and turning is

rendered both trouble&s;ome and dangerous. It was the old practice, in preternatural labours, to endea|vour to make the head pre&s;ent; but, on account of its bulk, it could &s;eldom be done, and the force em|ployed in making the attempt was often attended with fatal con&s;equences. The method of delivering by the feet is the mo&s;t important modern improve|ment in the practice of midwifery; an improvement to which many thou&s;ands owe their lives.</P>
<P>When the child lies in a tran&s;ver&s;e po&s;ition, the management is very &s;imple. We mu&s;t gently pa&s;s the hand into the uterus, to &s;earch for the feet, bring them down with the utmo&s;t caution, and fini&s;h the delivery as directed in footling-ca&s;es; for which pur|po&s;e the following rules &s;hould be ob&s;erved.</P>
<DIV5 TYPE="rules">
<HEAD>Rules for turning the CHILD.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. The woman mu&s;t be placed in a convenient po&s;ture, and kept &s;teady by a&s;&s;i&s;tants, that the opera|tor may be able to employ either hand, as the cir|cum&s;tances of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;e may require.</P>
<P N="2">2. Though the be&s;t po&s;ture for the operator, in general, as well as the patient, is the left &s;ide, with her breech placed over the edge of the bed, and her knees kept &s;eparate with a folded pillow, it will be &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;ary to turn her to her back; and in tho&s;e ca&s;es where the child's feet are of difficult acce&s;s, or where they lie towards the fundus uteri, the wo|man &s;hould be placed on her knees and elbows.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="281" REF="022551_0271_0FB943DE78142F98">
3. The orificium uteri &s;hould be enlarged &s;o much as to admit the hand to pa&s;s freely; and the &s;trong pains &s;hould be abated, before any attempt be made to deliver.</P>
<P N="4">4. It is of great con&s;equence to endeavour to learn the po&s;ition of the child, and to attend to the &s;hape and dimen&s;ions of the pelvis, before attempting to make the delivery.</P>
<P N="5">5. In preternatural ca&s;es, every po&s;&s;ible means ought to be u&s;ed to pre&s;erve the membranes as long as po&s;&s;ible. If they &s;hould break before the hand is introduced, and the &s;tate of the parts will admit of it, the hand &s;hould be quickly after pa&s;&s;ed; part of the water being thus retained, the operation of turn|ing will be greatly facilitated. But, if the waters be drained off, and the uterus rigidly contracted round the body of the child, warm oil &s;hould be injected into the uterus, to le&s;&s;en the rigidity of the parts, and a full do&s;e of laudanum &s;hould be exhibited, pre|vious to any attempt to procure delivery.</P>
<P N="6">6. The hand and arm of the operator mu&s;t be lu|bricated with pomatum, before attempting to intro|duce it into the vagina; the fingers mu&s;t be gathered together in a conical form, and the re&s;i&s;tance of the os externum be overcome by very &s;low and gradual degrees.</P>
<P N="7">7. In pa&s;&s;ing the hand into the uterus, it ought
<PB N="282" REF="022551_0272_0FB943DFB06BDBD8">
to be done in the gentle&s;t manner, but with a cer|tain degree of re&s;olution and courage. The pa&s;&s;ages &s;hould be well lubricated with butter, or pomatum; the line of the vagina and pelvis carefully attended to; the movements of the operator mu&s;t be &s;low and gradual; and thus, by giving time, the utmo&s;t rigi|dity in the &s;oft parts may be overcome.</P>
<P N="8">8. The hand ought to be introduced only during the remi&s;&s;ion of pain; when the pain comes, the ope|rator &s;hould &s;top, otherwi&s;e there is great hazard of pu&s;hing the hand, or &s;ome part of the child through the &s;ub&s;tance of the uterus.</P>
<P N="9">9. The hand &s;hould, if po&s;&s;ible, be introduced by the fore parts of the child, as the feet are generally folded along the belly; and both feet, if ea&s;ily come at, &s;hould be laid hold of.</P>
<P N="10">10. In pu&s;hing back any part of the body of the child to come at the feet, the palm of the hand, or broad expanded fingers, mu&s;t be u&s;ed. This part of the operation &s;hould be performed always during the remi&s;&s;ion of pain, which &s;hould al&s;o be ob&s;erved in bringing down the legs; but in making the extrac|tion of the body, when the legs are in the proper line of direction, the efforts of the arti&s;t ought always to co-operate with tho&s;e of nature.</P>
<P N="11">11. As the breech advances through the pelvis, the child, if not already in the proper po&s;ition,
<PB N="283" REF="022551_0273_0FB943E146048AE8">
mu&s;t be gradually turned with the fore-parts po&s;teri|orly to the mother.</P>
<P N="12">12. Practitioners in midwifery &s;hould be cautious of giving credit to any report of the child's death; for mo&s;t of the &s;ymptoms are fallacious. Children are often born alive when there is little rea&s;on to expect it: Therefore, in pu&s;hing up, bringing down the legs, or extracting the body, the child &s;hould never be treated roughly, but handled with the greate&s;t delicacy.</P>
<P N="13">13. When the hand is within the pelvis, and there is a nece&s;&s;ity for pa&s;&s;ing it pretty high in the uterus to &s;earch for the child's feet, the proper direction is not preci&s;ely in the line of the navel, as Dr SMEL|LIE advi&s;es; but inclining it a little to one &s;ide, to avoid the prominent angle of the &s;acrum, by which more room will be gained, and le&s;s pain given to the woman; for the womb pre&s;&s;es &s;trongly there.</P>
<P N="14">14. When the hand is interrupted in pa&s;&s;ing, by the &s;pa&s;modic contraction of the uterus, we mu&s;t de&s;i&s;t from further in&s;inuation, till the con&s;triction of the uterus is &s;omewhat abated.</P>
<P N="15">15. If the hand cannot pa&s;s beyond the pre&s;ent|ing part of the child to come at the feet, in&s;tead of thru&s;ting back the pre&s;enting part with violence, it &s;hould be, as it were, fir&s;t rai&s;ed up in the pelvis, and then moved to the oppo&s;ite &s;ide. By this means,
<PB N="284" REF="022551_0274_0FB943E305D9F490">
difficulties, otherwi&s;e in&s;urmountable, may be re|moved, and great danger often prevented.</P>
<P N="16">16. When both feet cannot readily be obtained, the foot and leg of the pre&s;enting part &s;hould be endeavoured to be fir&s;t brought down. Hence more room will be procured for &s;earching for the other foot, and the extraction will be performed with more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;e and &s;afety.</P>
<P N="17">17. If the &s;econd foot cannot readily be &s;ound or brought down, the child may be extracted with the utmo&s;t &s;afety by one foot only, provided we proceed &s;lowly in the operation.</P>
<P N="18">18. When the foot or feet begin to protrude with|out the os externum, let them be covered with a &s;oft cloth, and the advantage of the natural pains improved to a&s;&s;i&s;t the extraction.</P>
<P N="19">19. In all preternatural labours, when the child is delivered as far as the breech, the &s;tricture of the navel-&s;tring &s;hould be removed, by gently drawing it down a little, as already directed.</P>
<P N="20">20. As the breech advances towards the os exter|num, the proper means for guarding again&s;t lacera|tion of the perinaeum mu&s;t be attended to.</P>
<P N="21">21. The arms are to be relieved, and the head extracted, in the manner already directed in footling-ca&s;es.</P>
<P N="22">22. Children delivered by the foot, are not only often &s;till-born, but the body is &s;ometimes &s;epara|ted
<PB N="285" REF="022551_0275_0FB943E42CB90538">
from the neck, and the head left behind in the cavity of the uterus; an accident which can only happen by the ra&s;hne&s;s, negligence, or un&s;kilfulne&s;s of the practitioner.</P>
<P>The cau&s;es chiefly are, 1<HI>&s;t,</HI> The putrid &s;tate of the child's body in con&s;equence of its death; 2<HI>dly,</HI> The neglect of the operator to make the proper turns when extracting the body; 3<HI>dly,</HI> The narrowne&s;s of the pelvis, or bulk of the child's head.</P>
<P>To prevent it when the child's body is putrid; the operator &s;hould never attempt to extract the head till two fingers be introduced into the mouth; and by pulling down the jaw, and pre&s;&s;ing on the &s;houl|ders, while an a&s;&s;i&s;tant pre&s;&s;es gently on the woman's belly, and the woman her&s;elf bears down in the time of a pain, the extraction may generally, unle&s;s when the pelvis is narrow, be effected.</P>
<P N="23">23. If the head &s;hould be actually &s;eparated and left behind in the womb, and cannot be extracted by introducing two fingers into the mouth and wait|ing for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of pains, and the forceps &s;hould fail, the crotchet mu&s;t be u&s;ed. The me|thod is to keep the head &s;teady by the pre&s;&s;ure of an a&s;&s;i&s;tant on the woman's belly, the head is opened with the &s;ci&s;&s;ars, and extracted with the crotchet according to the rules already given.</P>
<P>By attending carefully to the above rules, lacera|tion of the uterus, floodings, convul&s;ions, inflam|mation,
<PB N="286" REF="022551_0276_0FB943E61779C018">
and their con&s;equences, may be prevented, and the child's life often pre&s;erved, even when it pre&s;ents in the mo&s;t awkward po&s;ition.</P>
<P>We proceed to con&s;ider a few particular ca&s;es</P>
<P>Ca&s;e 1. <HI>The Arm pre&s;enting.</HI>&mdash;This po&s;ition occurs frequently. It is of &s;ome con&s;equence to form a ge|neral notion how the child lies, before the operator &s;its down to deliver. The right-hand, by a little at|tention, may be readily di&s;tingui&s;hed from the left, if we lay hold of the child's hand, in the &s;ame man|ner as in &s;haking hands.</P>
<P>It is often in the power of a &s;kilful practitioner to prevent the hand from coming down, or to reduce it when it protrudes. But, if the arm be forced into the pa&s;&s;age &s;o low that the &s;houlder is locked in the pelvis, it is needle&s;s to give the woman the pain of at|tempting the reduction, unle&s;s when the head can be made to pre&s;ent, as the hand of the operator can be pa&s;&s;ed into the uterus by the &s;ide of the child's arm, which will of cour&s;e return into the uterus, when the feet are brought down into the vagina. As the head, in this ca&s;e, cannot ea&s;ily be made to pre&s;ent; in order, therefore, to make the delivery by turning the child, the hand and arm of the operator, well lu|bricated, mu&s;t be conducted into the uterus by the &s;ide of the child's arm, along the brea&s;t and belly of the child, towards the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the pelvis, where the head lies. If any difficulty occurs in coming at
<PB N="287" REF="022551_0277_0FB943E72197E250">
the feet, the hand already introduced mu&s;t be with|drawn, and the other pa&s;&s;ed in its &s;tead. If &s;till the hand cannot ea&s;ily be pu&s;hed beyond the child's &s;houl|der and head, the pre&s;enting part mu&s;t be gently rai|&s;ed up, or cautiou&s;ly &s;hifted to a &s;ide, that one or both feet may be taken hold of, which mu&s;t be brought as low as po&s;&s;ible, pu&s;hing up the head and &s;houlders, and pulling down the feet, alternately, till they advance into the vagina, or &s;o low that a noo&s;e or fillet can be ap|plied; and thus, by pulling with the one hand by means of the noo&s;e and pu&s;hing with the other, the feet can be brought down, and the delivery fini&s;hed in the mo&s;t complicated and difficult ca&s;es.</P>
<P>The method of forming the noo&s;e is, by pa&s;&s;ing the two ends of a piece of tape or garter through the mid|dle when doubled; or, if the garter be thick and clum|&s;y, by making an eye on one end, and pa&s;&s;ing the other extremity through it. This mu&s;t be mounted on the points of the fingers and thumb of the hand of the operator, who mu&s;t take hold of the child's foot, &s;lip it over the foot and ankle, and &s;ecure it by pulling at the other extremity.</P>
<P>Ca&s;e 2. <HI>The Shoulder.</HI>&mdash;Great care ought to be ta|ken that it may not be mi&s;taken for the buttock. The &s;houlder will feel harder and more bony than the full thick fle&s;hy hip; a mark which may be taken along with the others formerly mentioned in Breech-ca|&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="022551_0278_0FB943E8A2C4D160">
Tho' the child &s;hould originally pre&s;ent with the &s;houlder, when the ori&s;icium uteri is dilated, the arm if not prevented, may readily be forced by the repeat|ed efforts of the labour-throes into the pa&s;&s;age. In proportion as the pre&s;enting part advances, and the &s;houlder becomes lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ked in the pelvis, delivery by turning will be more difficult and hazardous.</P>
<P>Except the child be of a very &s;mall &s;ize, and the hand pre&s;&s;ed clo&s;e to the &s;ide of the head, it is impo&s;|&s;ible for the head and arm to pa&s;s together; it is, therefore, cruel and barbarous to pull the arm in or|der to deliver the child in that way. The arm has been often torn from the body, and the mother has died in the attempt.</P>

<P>When the arm protrudes in this manner, it ought, if po&s;&s;ible, to be reduced, and the head brought down into the pelvis; for it is often equally difficult and dangerous to deliver by the feet, and &s;ometimes ut|terly impracticable.</P>
<P><PB N="290" REF="022551_0280_0FB943EC9A7671D0">
A &s;kilful practitioner, having the management of the delivery from the beginning, will often be able to prevent the protru&s;ion of the arm, which ought to be attempted as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible after the rupture of the membranes. If he fails, and the arm &s;hould be forced down, the earlie&s;t opportunity &s;hould be taken to reduce it. If &s;ucce&s;sful, it will prevent much future trouble; it will be a happy circum|&s;tance for the mother, and may be the means of pre&s;erving both her life and that of the child. With this view, when the po&s;ition of the woman is adju&s;t|ed, the hand of the operator, well lubricated, mu&s;t be in&s;inuated thro' the vagina into the uterus, con|ducted by the child's arm, till it reaches as far as the axilla or &s;houlder. The &s;houlder mu&s;t then be rai&s;ed up, and &s;hifted, as it were, obliquely, to the &s;ide of the pelvis, oppo&s;ite to that to which it inclines. By this means the po&s;ition of the child will be &s;ome-what altered, and the arm drawn up within the vagina, &s;o that it will be afterwards no difficult ta&s;k to reduce it completely. But, &s;hould this method fail, an attempt may be made to pu&s;h up the fore-arm at the elbow; and, in bending it, great care mu&s;t be taken to avoid over-&s;training, or di&s;locating the joint. The&s;e attempts mu&s;t only be made in the intervals of pain: when the pain recurs, the operator ought immediately to de&s;i&s;t; for, by pu&s;hing in time of the pain, or in an improper di|rection,
<PB N="291" REF="022551_0281_0FB943EE629F72F8">
the uterus may be torn, and the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences &s;oon en&s;ue.</P>
<P>In whatever manner the reduction of the child's arm &s;hall be accompli&s;hed, if any method proves &s;ucce&s;sful, it mu&s;t be retained in the uterus by the hand of the operator, till the child's head, by the force of the next pain, fills up the pelvis, and pre|vents its return; otherwi&s;e the arm will be protruded as often as it is reduced.</P>
<P>But, if the orificium uteri be not &s;ufficiently open|ed to admit of the reduction of the protruding arm with &s;afety; if, as the arm advances, the head reclines to one &s;ide of the pelvis, the throes of labour are violent, and the intervals &s;hort; it would then be as dangerous to the patient as difficult to the operator, to attempt delivery by manual exertions; for the &s;pa&s;modic contractions of the uterus coun|teract every artificial effort; and if much mechani|cal force be u&s;ed, the uterus is in hazard of actual la|ceration. In the&s;e circum&s;tances, regardle&s;s of the anxiety of the patient, or the importunities of the attendants, the operator &s;hould de&s;i&s;t for &s;ome time from further efforts; a large do&s;e of liquid laudanum &s;hould be given, as from 50 to 70 gutts; and when the parts are &s;ufficiently dilated, and the &s;trong for|cing pains abated, his attempts &s;hould then be renew|ed, either to reduce the arm, or in&s;inuate his hand beyond it to come at the feet, bring them down,
<PB N="292" REF="022551_0282_0FB943F22C4ABAD8">
and deliver. If the&s;e attempts &s;hould fail, he may endeavour to alter the po&s;ition of the child, by fixing a noo&s;e on the arm, and pulling by it. More ea&s;y acce&s;s may be then obtained to the anterior parts of the child, by which the hand can be conducted to the feet. But, if every method &s;hould prove ineffec|tual either to reduce the arm or bring down a foot, and the woman's life is in danger, the head of the child, if it can be reached, mu&s;t be opened; after a proper interval, a crotchet introduced; and the extraction made by pulling at it and the protruded arm.</P>
<P>Should the head be without reach of the &s;ci&s;&s;ars, the crotchet mu&s;t be fixed on the trunk or thorax, with a view to bring down the breech or feet; by &s;ecuring a firm hold of the arm, and pulling by the cortchet, the delivery mu&s;t, in that manner, be accompli&s;hed; a mode of practice which &s;hould only be had recour&s;e to when the pelvis is faulty, or the patient's life in immediate danger.</P>
<P>IN the longitudinal contraction of the the uterus, when an arm pre&s;ents, and the &s;houlder is advanced in the pa&s;&s;age, &s;o that the feet cannot ea&s;ily be come at, Dr DENMAN advi&s;es <Q>to pull the body lower down by the arm, and the difficulty will be le&s;|&s;ened or removed.</Q> <Q>There is, happily (he adds), no nece&s;&s;ity of turning the child in the&s;e circum|&s;tances; for it will be born by the effect of the

<P>He adopts this opinion from four ca&s;es which oc|curred in his own practice, and &s;everal &s;imilar hi|&s;tories related by others; in all which, however, the child was dead.</P>
<P>He therefore infers, <Q>That, in ca&s;es in which children pre&s;ent with the arm, women would not nece&s;&s;arily die undelivered, tho' they were not a&s;|&s;i&s;ted by art.</Q></P>
<P>He concludes his ob&s;ervations with this important remark.</P>
<P><Q>The benefit we are to derive in practice from the knowledge of this fact is, that the cu&s;tom of turn|ing and delivering by the feet, in pre&s;entations of the arm, will remain nece&s;&s;ary and proper in all ca&s;es in which the operation can be performed with &s;afety to the mother, and give a chance of pre&s;er|ving the life of the child; but, when the child is dead, and when we have no other view, but merely to extract the child, to remove the danger thence ari&s;ing to the mother, it is of great impor|tance to know, that <HI>the child may be turned &s;ponta|neou&s;ly by the action of the uterus</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dr DENMAN's Aphori&s;ms re&s;pecting the Di&s;tinction and Management of Preternatural Pre&s;entation.&mdash;A &s;mall &s;yllabus which contains &s;ome of the mo&s;t important practical rules of the art.</NOTE>.</Q></P>

Dr DENMAN's remark is new to me. In a ca&s;e where the powers of nature have been u&s;ually con&s;i|dered as de&s;perate, it is new, perhaps, only becau&s;e the practitioner has thought it u&s;ele&s;s to wait for them. But though curious, as it &s;hows what nature in her &s;truggles can perform; and though &s;urpri&s;ing, as it apparently contradicts the laws of motion; it &s;eems to me unnece&s;&s;ary, as in the numerous arm|pre&s;entations which I have attended, the child has for the mo&s;t part been pre&s;erved, and the woman has &s;eldom &s;uffered any material injury from the delivery. I have therefore continued to practi&s;e the method which I have ju&s;t recommended; and, in the mo&s;t intricate pre&s;entations, have generally &s;ucceeded in making the delivery by fixing a fillet on the arm, and altering the po&s;ition in the manner mentioned, when every other method had failed. I have never yet known a ca&s;e to occur where the pelvis was tolerably proportioned, in which I could not either obtain acce&s;s to the feet to deliver by turning, or reduce the arm and bring down the head; and have, in &s;everal ca&s;es, &s;ucce&s;sfully turned where the pelvis was con&s;iderably di&s;torted<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In pre&s;ence of the Gentlemen who attended my Lectures la&s;t &s;ummer, I delivered a woman in the public lying-in ward, Royal Infirmary; the circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e were as follows.</P>
<P>The arm of the child pre&s;ented, and had been in the pa&s;&s;age, with the waters drained, from the preceding evening. The pel|vis was con&s;iderably di&s;torted, and the crotchet had been u&s;ed in her former deliveries. The woman is of an under-&s;ize, of a feeble con&s;titution, and the pa&s;&s;ages were &s;o tight as to cramp the hand when introduced into the pelvis. By gradual &s;tretching, and gen|tle in&s;inuation, I with &s;ome difficulty reached a foot, and accom|pli&s;hed the delivery without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of any in&s;trument.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="295" REF="022551_0285_0FB943F8976D8F00">
It may be nece&s;&s;ary, however, to &s;tate the princi|ples of this operation, that we may be aware how far to tru&s;t the una&s;&s;i&s;ted efforts of the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>The longitudinal contraction of the uterus, is one of tho&s;e blind and indi&s;criminate attempts which na|ture &s;ometimes makes to free her&s;elf from a burden. When her powers are exhau&s;ted, the&s;e efforts are di|mini&s;hed, and the uterus is relaxed. In the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances, then, if we can fix the arm, the body will of it&s;elf turn as on an axis; and the <HI>heavier</HI> part, or the breech, will come downward and be deli|vered: The arm is <HI>fixed</HI> by drawing down the &s;houl|der; but it will be obvious, that the natural falling down of the breech will immediately draw it back again<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> and it is in this way that the child does not <HI>ultimately</HI> come down double. This operation can be ea&s;ily imitated on machinery, if the aperture is con|ical to fix that part which repre&s;ents the arm; and it is in this way clear, that the contradiction to the laws of motion is apparent only.</P>
<P>In the manner we have ju&s;t &s;tated, this mode of de|livery

may &s;eem to be preferable; but various cir|cum&s;tances dimini&s;h its advantages. Dr DENMAN has very properly limited it to the delivery of a dead child, and we may add a well-proportioned pelvis: but, even there, we exhau&s;t the powers of nature, without an adequate advantage; e&s;pecially if we re|flect, that, in this exhau&s;ted &s;tate, an incon&s;iderable increa&s;e of the u&s;ual di&s;charges may prove fatal.</P>
<P>The&s;e facts may, however, teach us, not to at|temp the extraction by turning too early; for by a little delay till the &s;trong pains are abated, it will be more practicable, and my &s;ucce&s;s has fully confirmed its &s;afety.</P>

as &s;eldom as po&s;&s;ible, till the orificium uteri be &s;uf|ficiently dilated.

The hand mu&s;t be pa&s;&s;ed on the out|&s;ide of the membranes between and the uterus, in a direction towards the fundus.

<HEAD>Method of Delivery in Flooding Ca&s;es.</HEAD>
<P>FLOODINGS, as already explained, proceed from a &s;eparation of &s;ome portion of the placenta, or &s;pon|gy chorion, from the internal &s;urface of the uterus. But the mo&s;t dangerous haemorrhagies ari&s;e from a &s;eparation of the cake when attached to the cervix, or over the orificium uteri<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the article <HI>Flooding</HI> in Pathology of Parturition.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Floodings, before the 7th month of ge&s;tation, may be often checked by the management formerly di|rected; after which period, however, there is al|ways con&s;iderable danger. And, as it is &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;ary to deliver, even when no part of the placen|ta can be reached with the finger, the con&s;tant atten|dance of the practitioner is requi&s;ite, and the utmo&s;t judgment to catch the proper time of proceeding.</P>
<P>There is hazard in attempting delivery too ear|ly, while the os uteri is clo&s;e and rigid. When the woman, from lo&s;s of blood, is &s;omewhat &s;unk, the uterine orifice is more relaxed and dilatable. The time can only be determined by con&s;tantly &s;taying with the patient, and examining the &s;tate of the os uteri occa&s;ionally. In &s;o critical a &s;ituation, the
<PB N="300" REF="022551_0290_0FB94401320E02B8">
neglect of half an hour, or le&s;s, may be fatal to the mother and child.</P>
<P>The be&s;t practice in this ca&s;e is, fir&s;t, to wait on; giving opiates at proper intervals, and keeping the woman quiet and cool. If po&s;&s;ible, delivery &s;hould never be attempted till pains occur, and the mem|branes begin to protrude. Pains may be brought on, or increa&s;ed, by gently irritating the os tincae. The membranes may then be broken by pu&s;hing a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">inger, or the catheter, thro' them; the water, gu&s;h|ing out, the womb contracts and &s;tops the bleed|ing. We can now &s;afely wait for &s;ix, twelve, or twenty-four hours, if nece&s;&s;ary, till the pains recur, and then deliver according to the pre&s;entation. But, if the flooding &s;hould not then abate, or if the po&s;i|tion of the foetus be unfavourable, the hand mu&s;t be pa&s;&s;ed into the uterus, the feet of the child taken hold of and brought down. The uterus now con|tracting, &s;oon &s;tops the flow of blood, or prevents an exce&s;&s;ive di&s;charge: therefore, after the feet are brought down, the body of the child &s;hould be extract|ed by very &s;low and gradual efforts; le&s;t, from too &s;udden evacuation of the uterine contents, fatal faintings or convul&s;ions might en&s;ue.</P>
<P>Flooding, from the <HI>attachment of the placenta at the orificium uteri,</HI> will be &s;ufficiently indicated by its alarming appearance and rapid increa&s;e, and by the &s;oft pappy feel of the cake to the touch; though,
<PB N="301" REF="022551_0291_0FB944030C1A7AF0">
when there is little dilatation of the os tincae, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to introduce the whole hand into the vagina, in order, more certainly, to be able to feel the placenta with a finger introduced within the os internum.</P>
<P>In the&s;e unhappy ca&s;es, there is no method of &s;aving the woman, but by immediate delivery.</P>
<P>We are &s;ometimes obliged to pa&s;s the hand at an opening made through the body of the placenta; but, if po&s;&s;ible, the hand &s;hould rather be in&s;inuated at the &s;ide of the cake, where the lea&s;t portion is attached, to go into the uterus, break the mem|branes, &s;earch for the child's feet, bring them down, and deliver.</P>
<P>In &s;ome in&s;tances, before the orificium uteri can be &s;ufficiently opened to admit the hand of the ope|rator to pa&s;s, the whole cake will actually be di&s;en|gaged and protruded; but the &s;eparation and expul|&s;ion of the placenta, previous to the birth of the child, is, for the mo&s;t part, fatal to the mother.</P>

<P><HI>Prolap&s;ed Funis</HI>&mdash;A pre&s;&s;ure on the umbilical cord, perhaps for ten minutes, by interrupting the circula|tation, will be &s;ufficient to de&s;troy the life of the child. A cooldne&s;s and want of pul&s;ation in the cord, is the mo&s;t infallible &s;ign of the child's death; therefore, if any portion of the former be protruded before any bulky part of the child, there is hazard of the lo&s;s of the child, unle&s;s the labour be &s;oon over. The danger can only be prevented by re-placing the cord, and retaining it above the pre&s;enting part of the child, till it be &s;o far protruded by the force of the pain, as to prevent the return of the cord; or, the child mu&s;t be turned and delivered by the feet, (for the forceps cannot be u&s;ed till the head be well advanced in the pelvis.) But it is often difficult to reduce the cord, and much more &s;o to turn the child. For, if the pains be &s;trong and frequent, the con&s;e|quence of &s;uch attempts may be fatal to the mother.</P>
<P>If the child be of an ordinary, or &s;mall &s;ize, and the pelvis be well formed; if the labour goes on quick|ly,
<PB N="303" REF="022551_0293_0FB9440A668C7820">
and e&s;pecially if the woman had formerly good deliveries; the child may yet be born alive. If, on the contrary, the child exceeds the ordinary &s;ize, or the pelvis comes &s;hort of its u&s;ual dimen&s;ions, turning would prove a dangerous operation to the mother, and there is little pro&s;pect of &s;aving the in|fant by it.</P>
<P>The be&s;t practice, therefore, is to take the earlie&s;t opportunity that the circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e will admit of, to reduce the cord, by placing the woman in a proper po&s;ition, &s;o that the hand of the operator may be carried up, in the ab&s;ence of pain, into the pelvis, and the cord entirely reduced. If this me|thod &s;ails,&mdash;and it cannot be practi&s;ed when the pains are &s;trong and frequent, or the head wedged in the pelvis, no farther attempts &s;hould be made; and the child &s;hould be allowed to be propelled by the na|tural pains, or protruded &s;o low that the forceps can be u&s;ed.</P>

<P>When there is rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that there is ano|ther child, after the delivery of the fir&s;t, it ought to be a&s;certained by pa&s;&s;ing a finger within the os uteri; or, if that is in&s;ufficient, by the introduction of the hand.</P>
<P>The &s;ymptoms chiefly to be tru&s;ted, after the birth of one child, are,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1<HI>&s;t,</HI> The diminutive &s;ize of the child, and the waters being di&s;proportioned to the di&s;tention of the gravid uterus.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2<HI>dly,</HI> The umbilical chord, after it is divided, con|tinuing to bleed beyond the u&s;ual time.</ITEM>

<ITEM>5<HI>thly,</HI> The abdominal tumor not &s;en&s;ibly dimi|ni&s;hed between the &s;tomach and umbilicus.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="022551_0295_0FB9440E20E0BF80">
All the&s;e &s;ymptoms are &s;eldom united; and &s;eve|ral of them are, by them&s;elves, fallacious: for the placentae of twins are often di&s;tant from each other in the uterus, and &s;o loo&s;ely connected to it, that one may entirely &s;eparate before the &s;econd child be born; &s;o that labour-pains will &s;ometimes cea&s;e for two or three days, and there is the &s;ame interval between the births of the children.</P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary, therefore, to attend to the u&s;ual diminution of the belly; and, in doubtful ca&s;es, to introduce the hand into the uterus.</P>
<P>The po&s;ition of twins or triplets is commonly that which is mo&s;t commodiou&s;ly adapted to the uterus, and which will occupy the lea&s;t room. One child often pre&s;ents naturally; the other, or others, by the feet or breech; &s;ometimes both, or all, pre&s;ent na|turally: at other times, the po&s;ition is cro&s;s: &s;o that the delivery mu&s;t be regulated by the pre&s;enta|tion.</P>
<P>With regard to the management, oppo&s;ite &s;enti|ments have been entertained.</P>
<P>In &s;ome in&s;tances, natural pains, after the delivery of the fir&s;t child, &s;oon come on. The membranes will then be quickly forced down, and the pre&s;enting part of the child may be readily felt through them; but, if the pre&s;entation of the child &s;hould be doubt|ful to the touch, the practitioner ought immediately
<PB N="306" REF="022551_0296_0FB9441043FC2FF8">
to place the woman in a proper po&s;ition, and gently in&s;inuate his hand, by the &s;ide of the membranes, into the uterus, and examine how the child lies. If the head or breech pre&s;ent, it is only nece&s;&s;ary to break the membranes, withdraw the hand, and leave the child to be expelled by the natural pains. If the feet are felt through the membranes, let them be broken, the feet taken hold of, and brought into the pa&s;&s;age. The delivery mu&s;t be otherwi&s;e managed as directed in footling-ca&s;es, carefully ob&s;erving not to neglect the proper turns in extracting the body.</P>
<P>If any other part than the head, breech, or feet &s;hould pre&s;ent, the latter mu&s;t be &s;earched for through the membranes, and brought down into the pa&s;&s;age. The feet may, by a dexterous operator, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, be brought down without breaking the membranes; but, if they &s;hould be ruptured in the attempt, the feet mu&s;t then immediately be taken hold of, gently brought down, and the delivery fini&s;hed as formerly directed.</P>
<P>When the uterus is very much di&s;tended, it, in &s;ome degree, lo&s;es its power of contraction. From this cau&s;e the pains are often le&s;s &s;trong and forcing, and the labour is more tedious, in twins and triplets, than when there is but one child; hence a con&s;ide|rable length of time, as &s;everal days, in &s;ome in&s;tan|ces, intervenes between the birth of the different children. In this interval, the woman is apt to &s;uffer
<PB N="307" REF="022551_0297_0FB94411245BC510">
from impatience and anxiety. Floodings frequently come on; and the labour is more painful and hazar|dous, in proportion as the time of delivery is pro|tracted. It may therefore be recommended to prac|titioners as a general rule, If labour-pains do not naturally recur &s;oon after the birth of the fir&s;t child, to place the woman in a proper po&s;ition, gently pa&s;s the hand into the uterus, break the membranes, and manage the delivery according to the pre&s;entation.</P>
<P>As this &s;ubject has given ri&s;e to a variety of opini|ons among authors, we &s;hall add, for the in&s;truction of young practitioners, a few rules, which include the whole directions nece&s;&s;ary for the management.</P>
<DIV5 TYPE="rules">
<HEAD>Rules for Delivery, in ca&s;es of Twins, Triplets, &amp;c</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. If a &s;econd child be &s;u&s;pected, let a ligature immediately be made on the end of the umbilical cord next the mother, le&s;t the two placentae being connected, the cord &s;hould continue to bleed.</P>
<P N="2">2. Having waited the u&s;ual time, as if for the &s;e|paration of the placenta, and it appears to adhere firmly, let a finger be pa&s;&s;ed up by the &s;ide of the cord to examine whether there is another &s;et of mem|branes.</P>
<P>Some part of the former water may be retained within a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">old of the membranes, and, protruding at the orifice of the uterus, may be mi&s;taken by an in|experienced
<PB N="308" REF="022551_0298_0FB94592013AAE98">
practitioner for a &s;econd &s;et of mem|branes: but the di&s;tinction may readily be made by moving the finger round and round the protruding bag; or, if it be &s;till doubtful, the hand mu&s;t be pa&s;&s;ed into the uterus.</P>
<P>When it is a&s;certained that there is any other child the accoucheur &s;hould &s;tay with his patient, as if wai|ting for the &s;eparation of the placenta, and carefully ob&s;erve le&s;t a flooding &s;hould occur.</P>
<P N="4">4. A gentle compre&s;&s;ion ought to be made on the abdomen, which mu&s;t be gradually tightened as the u|terine tumor &s;ub&s;ides.</P>
<P N="5">5. If pains &s;oon come on, and the child pre&s;ents in a po&s;ition in which it can advance without manual a&s;&s;i&s;tance, let it be expelled by the natural pains. If it comes double, or by the feet, when the breech is advanced as far as the os externum, let the proper turns be carefully attended to.</P>
<P N="6">6. If labour-pains do not occur within the &s;pace of a few hours after the delivery of the fir&s;t child, it will then be advi&s;able to place the woman in a con|venient po&s;ition for delivery, to pa&s;s the hand into the uterus, break the membranes, and otherwi&s;e ma|nage the delivery as already directed. For if pains do not &s;oon come on the woman may go on undelivered for &s;everal days, unle&s;s the membranes be broken. When the waters are evacuated, the uterus contracts and the child quickly advances.</P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="022551_0299_0FB9459369F8E368">
If the pains be trifling, and have little effect in pro|truding the child, the &s;ame management will be ne|ce&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P N="7">7. If, from the very &s;mall &s;ize of the fir&s;t and &s;econd child, there may be rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that any other yet remains; after having waited about half an hour for the &s;eparation of the placenta, without effect, let the hand be again pa&s;&s;ed into the uterus, and if a third &s;et of membranes be di&s;covered, let them be broken, and the delivery managed as already directed. If there be no other child, let the placentae be di&s;en|gaged and extracted. But if they adhere firmly, it is better to keep the hand in the uterus, till by its con|traction they are gradually &s;eparated and di&s;engaged rather than to attempt it by force.</P>
<P N="8">8. The placentae of twins and triplets are often connected, and adhere at the edges, though each child has its di&s;tinct membranes and water.</P>
<P>When they adhere at the &s;ides, they &s;eparate, and are expelled together, after the birth of the la&s;t of the children. But, when they are attached in different portions to the uterus, the placenta frequently fol|lows the birth of that child to which it belonged, be|fore the &s;econd labour en&s;ues.</P>
<P N="9">9. When another child is di&s;covered, no attempt ought to be made to remove the placenta, before the delivery of the remaining child or children; &s;uch at|tempts would expo&s;e the woman to the hazard of
<PB N="310" REF="022551_0300_0FB9459554FC9AB8">
flooding, which might end fatally before the uterus could be emptied of its contents.</P>
<P N="10">10. The placentae of twins, or triplets, generally &s;eparate ea&s;ily, provided that time be given for the contraction of the uterus. Each cord &s;hould be cau|tiou&s;ly pulled, &s;ometimes alternately, &s;ometimes pul|ling by both, or by all at once, de&s;iring the woman to a&s;&s;i&s;t gently by her own efforts.</P>
<P>When the bulky ma&s;s advances as far as the os tincae, the re&s;i&s;tance occa&s;ioned by the contracting orifice mu&s;t be removed, by the introduction of a fin|ger or two within the pa&s;&s;age, to bring down the edge: the &s;ub&s;tance of the cake is then to be gra&s;ped firmly, and the whole entirely extracted.</P>
<P>When they adhere in di&s;tinct portions, they mu&s;t be &s;eparated, one after another and removed.</P>
<P N="11">11. If flooding &s;hould occur, or any of tho&s;e ob|&s;tacles to expul&s;ion, formerly mentioned, the hand mu&s;t be conducted into the uterus, and the &s;epara|tion and extraction of the placentae accompli&s;hed a|greeably to the directions already given.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>THE greate&s;t part of the preceeding work, in the former Edition, having been printed before Dr O&s;burne's Treati&s;e came into my hands, I then took the earlie&s;t opportunity to acknowledge the polite and re&s;pectful manner with which that gentleman ex|pre&s;&s;ed his &s;entiments on &s;ome &s;ubjects in which we &s;eem to have differed in opinion.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t attempt of an author, in the infancy of practice and touching, mu&s;t be rude and imperfect: frequent reflection from reading and experience, ena|ble him to detect the errors of others, and to guide his own &s;teps with caution and &s;afety. The Ele|ments of Midwifery were originally intended as a very &s;hort &s;yllabus for the u&s;e of the Author's &s;tudents only. It was begun and carried on in a hurry, ha|ving been actually written and publi&s;hed in little more than two months. The &s;upplement, de&s;igned to &s;upply the omi&s;&s;ions in the text, &s;hows that the Author was &s;en&s;ible of the deficiency of the former part.</P>
<P>As our opinions, at pre&s;ent, more nearly coincide, it is unnece&s;&s;ary to trouble Dr O&s;burne or the Pub|lic
<PB N="313" REF="022551_0303_0FB9459DD5D39DB0">
with any pompous, laboured reply: I &s;hall, there|fore, confine my&s;elf to a few ob&s;ervations on tho&s;e remarks in his publication, in which I my&s;elf, only, am concerned.</P>
<P N="1">1. Dr O&s;burne (page 69,) condemns the practice of fixing the crotched <HI>&s;omewhere on the out&s;ide of the &s;kull.</HI> This, however, was the practice, even in Lon|don, when I atteded an eminent teacher not a great many years ago. It was the practice of Dr Smellie; and more lately of Dr Young; late profe&s;&s;or in this univer&s;ity, an operator as &s;kilful and &s;ucce&s;sful as a|ny of the former. The con&s;truction of that in&s;tru|ment, plainly &s;hows, that it was originally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to be fixed <HI>on the out&s;ide of the &s;kull chiefly.</HI> The con|cavity of the blade is exactly adapted to the convex|ity of the child's head. But I have 'already ob&s;erved, in this volume, that the crotchet &s;hould be fixed in the <HI>ba&s;is of the &s;kull;</HI> though there are &s;ome ca&s;es in which it may &s;till be proper &s;ometimes to fix it on the out&s;ide. An experienced operator can, however, decide on this point, after he has maturely con&s;ider|ed the circum&s;tances both of the pre&s;entation and pelvis.</P>
<P N="2">2. The calculation of the &s;ucce&s;sful ca&s;es, in which the Cea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">arean operation was performed, were taken from old authors, exclu&s;ive of unfortunate ca|&s;es in Britain; and the author candidly acknowledges the mi&s;take into which they had led him. He
<PB N="314" REF="022551_0304_0FB9459EAC2A88A8">
cannot avoid, however, expre&s;&s;ing his &s;urpri&s;e, that Dr O&s;burne &s;hould have &s;o far mi&s;under&s;tood his meaning, as to in&s;inuate, that he would ever recom|mend the operation to be performed on the living &s;ub|ject, except in tho&s;e rare ca&s;es where it appeared ab|&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible to extract a child through the a|perture of the pelvis<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>"When the hand of the operator cannot be introduced within the pelvis; or, in other words, when its large&s;t diameter does not exceed one inch, or one inch and a half: this conforma|tion is perhaps the only one which renders the Cae&s;arean operati|on ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. Happily, however, &s;uch a &s;tructure ve|ry &s;eldom occurs in practice; and, when it does, the Accouch|cur will readily di&s;cover it by attending to the following circum|&s;tances, and to the common marks of a narrow pelvis. Where the capacity of the pelvis is &s;o &s;trait as not to admit any part of the child's head to enter, nor of two fingers of the Accouchcur's hand to conduct proper in&s;truments to tear, break down, and extract the child piece-meal, in this ca&s;e recour&s;e mu&s;t he had to the Cae&s;a|rean &s;ection; an expedient, though dreadful and hazardous, that will give the woman and child the only chance of life; and which, if timely and prudently conducted, notwith&s;tanding the many in|&s;tances wherein it has failed, may be performed with great pro|bability of &s;ucce&s;s." Elements of Midwifery, p. 241.</P>
<P>And, le&s;t he had not formerly been &s;ufficiently explicit, the following caution is &s;ubjoined in the Supplement.</P>
<P>"The ab&s;olute impracticability of extracting a child through the aperture of the pelvis, is perhaps the only circum&s;tance that ju&s;ti|fies the performance of the Cae&s;arean operation on the living &s;ubject; which ought never to be had recour&s;e to in ca&s;es of di&s;ea|&s;es, or original mal-conformation of the &s;oft parts of generation, when there is no &s;u&s;picion of deformity of the bones." Elements of Midwifery, p. 292.</P></NOTE>: And to a deficiency of &s;pace
<PB N="315" REF="022551_0305_0FB945A0225BCE90">
in the <HI>bony cavity alone,</HI> he expre&s;sly confines it; <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <Q>where the tran&s;ver&s;e diameter, at the brim, mea|&s;ures from one to, not exceeding, two inches.</Q></P>
<P>His motives for mentioning the ca&s;es in which the operation had been performed, were to &s;how from authentic records, that however formidable and hazardous, it is certainly practicable; and to regret the imperfection of an art which obliges us, <HI>&s;ometimes,</HI> to have recour&s;e to the dreadful alternative of witne&s;&s;ing the un&s;ucce&s;sful efforts of Nature in her la&s;t feeble &s;truggles; or by a de&s;perate effort of the limited powers of &s;urgery, offer our a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Dr O&s;burne a&s;&s;erts, <Q>that a child can be extracted by embryulcia, through a pelvis who&s;e aperture from pubes to &s;acrum mea&s;ures only one inch and a half; dimen&s;ions much le&s;s than what have invariably been &s;uppo&s;ed to require the Cae&s;arean operation, even in the late&s;t and be&s;t books<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dr OS<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">URNE's Treati&s;e on Laborious Parturition, p. 251.</NOTE>.</Q> And by this means he hopes to dimini&s;h, if not &s;upercede, the nece&s;&s;ity of the Cae&s;arean &s;ection, by &s;ub&s;tituting the crotchet in its &s;tead. He goes further, and endeavours to prove, (p. 251 and 252.)
<PB N="316" REF="022551_0306_0FB945A1C3AF5430">
<Q>that the head of a mature foetus may be &s;afely extracted with the crotchet, its volume having been previou&s;ly le&s;&s;ened, wherever there is a &s;pace equal to one inch and a half from pubes to &s;acrum:</Q> And a&s;&s;erts, <Q>that, in the&s;e circum&s;tances, deli|very may be <HI>always</HI> effected with &s;afety to the mother.</Q></P>
<P>The world is infinitely obliged to this author for the uncommon pains he hath taken to &s;how <Q>what are the &s;malle&s;t po&s;&s;ible dimen&s;ions of the pelvis through which a child, with its head opened, can be extracted, with &s;afety to the mother, by means of the crotchet.</Q> I hope, and earne&s;tly wi&s;h, for the honour of the profe&s;&s;ion, and the credit of Dr O&s;burne, that his data may be well-grounded, and that the re&s;ult may prove adequate to his expectations.</P>
<P>But, though the dimen&s;ions of the pelvis may be capable of men&s;uration with mathematical pre|ci&s;ion, yet the difference in the bulk and &s;olidity of childrens heads cannot &s;o ea&s;ily be a&s;certained; nor can I entirely agree with Dr O&s;burne when he &s;ays, (p. 27,) <Q>We are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, however, of the means of determining it with exactne&s;s &s;ufficient to direct our practice in the &s;afe&s;t and be&s;t manner.</Q></P>

in circum&s;tances hitherto deemed unfavoura|ble and de&s;perate. But, in a pelvis of a &s;imilar con&s;truction, various cau&s;es may concur to di&s;ap|point our views, and baffle our attempts; or, from the ob&s;tacles that nece&s;&s;arily occur, delivery mu&s;t always be precarious in the con&s;equences; and this will dimini&s;h the value of the advantages we might otherwi&s;e expect to derive from this important di&s;|covery.</P>
<P>To conclude: Though we allow the whole of Dr O&s;burne's po&s;tulata, it mu&s;t &s;till be acknow|edged, that ca&s;es of narrowne&s;s from di&s;tortion &s;ometimes, though &s;eldom, do occur, in which a dead child cannot be extracted by the &s;ci&s;&s;ars and crotchet, even in the hands of the mo&s;t &s;kilful and dexterous practitioner.&mdash;Shall we, <HI>then,</HI> be un|concerned &s;pectators of the fatal event that mu&s;t en|&s;ue? Or, &s;hall we dare to interfere; and, by an operation apparently cruel, and from its con&s;equences de&s;perate, make a la&s;t effort of that a&s;&s;i&s;tance which our limited art affords in behalf of our patient<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have been ju&s;t informed, on authority which I tru&s;t, of a work lately publi&s;hed on the Continent, which contains many ca&s;es of utility of the <HI>divi&s;ion of the pubes,</HI> where "a con&s;iderable &s;pace was gained by the operation."&mdash;The account of this pub|lication hath not yet appeared in any of the foreign Journals.</NOTE>?</P>
