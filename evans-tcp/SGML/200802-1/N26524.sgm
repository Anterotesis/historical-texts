<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THAT the following oration may lead to no mi&s;con|ception of the opinion I entertain, re&s;pecting the actual origin of our late epidemics, I beg leave to introduce it to the notice of my fellow-citizens, by a few preliminary re|marks.</P>
<P N="1">I. I do not believe that, either, in the years ninety three, ninety &s;even, or ninety eight, the American pe&s;tilence was exclu&s;ively of dome&s;tic origin. I am per&s;uaded that, on each of tho&s;e occa&s;ions, a very powerful cau&s;e of this di&s;|ea&s;e, was introduced into Philadelphia, through the channel of commerce. I do not, however, with &s;ome phy&s;icians, conceive, that this cau&s;e was introduced in the form of <HI>human contagion,</HI> generated in the di&s;ea&s;ed bodies of men, but in that of <HI>foul air,</HI> re&s;ulting from the putrid balla&s;t, or damaged cargoes of ve&s;&s;els. Nor have I, on enquiry, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">nd rea&s;on to believe, that there exi&s;ts, on record, a &s;ingle well authenticated in&s;tance, of the di&s;ea&s;e in que&s;tion, having, ever, in the former method, been introduced into any part
<PB N="viii" REF="035263_0005_1001B3DDD7D67E48">
of the United States. As often as commerce has borne a part in giving birth to this di&s;ea&s;e, in any of our &s;eaports, it does not appear to have been through the in&s;trumentality of <HI>human contagion,</HI> imported from the Ea&s;t or We&s;t Indies, from the Levant, or the &s;hores of Africa; but, as lately in this place, through that of pe&s;tiferous air, generated by the putrefactive di&s;&s;olution of the cargoes or balla&s;t of ve&s;|&s;els at &s;ea. Nor is it a matter of the &s;malle&s;t import, from what quarter of the globe the&s;e cargoes come. Provided, they be of a putrefiable nature, and arrive in our ports, during the inten&s;ity of our &s;ummer heats, (but, particularly, between the middle of July and la&s;t of September,) it is wholly immaterial whether they be the native productions of Europe, of A&s;ia, of Africa, or of the We&s;t India I&s;lands. And it is equally immaterial, from which of the&s;e places they are immediately imported. The &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, therefore, of commercial intercour&s;e, during certain months in the year, with the We&s;t India I&s;lands alone, would be a mea|&s;ure wholly inadequate to the prevention of this di&s;ea&s;e. Were &s;uch &s;u&s;pen&s;ion adopted by the Government of the Union, it &s;hould, unque&s;tionably, extend to all parts of the globe, from which putrefiable cargoes may be imported. But &s;uch an impolitic mea&s;ure, &s;ugge&s;ts at once &s;ufficient cau&s;e for its immediate rejection, as it is evidently pregnant with nothing le&s;s than ab&s;olute ruin to the commerce of our country.</P>
<P N="2">II. I have not found &s;ufficient cau&s;e to believe, that, without the co-operation of foul air, from the ve&s;&s;els at our wharves, the American pe&s;tilence would have become
<PB N="ix" REF="035263_0006_1001B3E580F45E98">
<HI>epidemic,</HI> in our city, in either of the years, to which I have alluded. I have even gone &s;o far as to flatter my&s;elf, with a belief, that, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of our city, &s;uch co-ope|ration is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to its epidemic prevalence. In this belief, however, I am, by no means, confirmed. Perhaps, even now, the filth of our city and &s;uburbs has accumulated to a &s;ufficient height, to give to pe&s;tilence an epidemic rage. In ninety three, I had not completed my medical &s;tudies, and can, therefore, &s;ay nothing re&s;pecting the immediate &s;ource of particular ca&s;es, that might have occurred in the city during that year. But I he&s;itate not to &s;ay, with as much confidence, as I ought to u&s;e, in &s;peaking on any &s;peculative &s;ubject in phy&s;ics, that, in ninety &s;even and ninety eight, I &s;aw, my&s;elf, &s;everal ca&s;es of the di&s;ea&s;e in que&s;tion, which mu&s;t have nece&s;&s;arily re|&s;ulted from the operation of dome&s;tic cau&s;es. I am further confident, that many ca&s;es of a &s;imilar nature, were attend|ed by &s;ome of my medical friends. If, then, from the pre|&s;ent &s;ources of our city, &s;olitary, or (to &s;peak in medical language) &s;poradic ca&s;es of pe&s;tilence may now occur, how melancholy is our pro&s;pect, &s;hould the filth in our city and &s;uburbs, be &s;uffered to accumulate with the progre&s;s of time! Of &s;uch an accumulation mu&s;t not an epidemic be finally the offspring?</P>
<P>But let us, even, for a moment, admit, that not a &s;ingle ca&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the epidemics of ninety three, ninety &s;even, or nine|ty eight, originated from the exclu&s;ive operation of dome&s;|tic cau&s;es. Still, it is a po&s;ition, which no one will venture
<PB N="x" REF="035263_0007_1001B3EDB501FDF8">
to deny, that their rapid and exten&s;ive propagation, was ef|fected by &s;ome peculiarity in the atmo&s;phere of our city. This inference we draw from the <HI>very few</HI> in&s;tances, in which, the pe&s;tilence, under con&s;ideration, was propagated by contagion when taken from the city to the unadulter|ated atmo&s;phere of the country.</P>
<P>Were the atmo&s;phere of Philadelphia pre&s;erved in purity, by a due degree of attention to dome&s;tic cleanline&s;s, and by preventing ve&s;&s;els, charged with foul air, from entering our port, pe&s;tilence, as an epidemic, would never again occur, to &s;well the catalogue of our future misfortunes.&mdash; In &s;uch a &s;tate of things, &s;poradic ca&s;es of the di&s;ea&s;e might, <HI>possibly,</HI> originate with our&s;elves, and might, un|que&s;tionably, be introduced from di&s;tant places; but the evil would terminate with the death or recovery of tho&s;e fir&s;t attacked, and would never &s;pread, to the di&s;tre&s;s of our citizens, and the depopulation of our city. The baleful plant, though fairly ingrafted on our &s;y&s;tems, would lan|gui&s;h, wither, and die for want of nouri&s;hment!</P>
<P N="3">III. Thus, whatever principles, I may advocate, with re&s;pect to the practicability of pe&s;tilence originating and exi&s;ting, as an epidemic, in our city, under certain circum|&s;tances, from the exclu&s;ive operation of dome&s;tic cau&s;es, I believe this to be an event, which has never yet occurred, Commerce appears to have been, at all times, ju&s;tly charge|able with part of the calamity, that has never failed, to accompany this wor&s;t of evils. The epidemic train would &s;eem to have been, always, laid in our atmo&s;phere, by the ac|tion
<PB N="xi" REF="035263_0008_1001AE61C30A07C8">
of the &s;ummer-&s;un on the filth of our city and &s;uburbs, while immen&s;e volumes of foul air, di&s;charged from the holds of ve&s;&s;els at our wharves, &s;erved as the &s;park to rou&s;e it into flame. Had not the train exi&s;ted, the &s;park would have expired without effect, and had not the &s;park been applied, the train would have lain dormant, and, perhaps never bur&s;t into actual explo&s;ion&mdash;If, then, by the de&s;truc|tion of either of the&s;e, we might acquire an exemption from the inevitable effects of their co-operation, by the re|moval of the one, and the prevention of the other, we be|come doubly &s;ecure again&s;t the calamities, to which they give origin.</P>
<P>I hope I will be indulged in attempting, by another ana|logy, a farther illu&s;tration of the above intricate and inter|e&s;ting &s;ubject. With this view, I would compare the &s;um|mer atmo&s;phere of our city, deeply contaminated by putrid ex|halations from dome&s;tic &s;ources, to a ma&s;s of pa&s;te or dough, duly kneaded, and prepared to undergo the proce&s;s of fermen|tation. In this &s;tate of things, the yea&s;t, or leven, calculated and intended to give actual birth to this proce&s;s, not unfit|ly repre&s;ents the foul air i&s;&s;uing from the holds of ve&s;&s;els at our wharves, and mixing, in abundance, with our viti|ated atmo&s;phere. As the operation of the ferment is well known to be, that of a&s;&s;imilating to it&s;elf, the ma&s;s into which it is introduced, &s;uch would &s;eem to be the effect of the deleterious air di&s;charged along our wharves. It com|municates to the atmo&s;phere of our city, <HI>perhaps,</HI> by a peculiar &s;pecies of fermentation, its own pe&s;tilential and
<PB N="xii" REF="035263_0009_1001B3FA0136D638">
de&s;tructive properties. Or, like the matter of the &s;mall|pox, introduced into a &s;y&s;tem predi&s;po&s;ed to its reception, it inoculates our atmo&s;phere with effect, and thus, <HI>possibly,</HI> by an inde&s;cribable &s;pecies of &s;ympathetic action, approxi|mates to its own nature, the air that &s;urrounds us.</P>
<P>If we pay due attention to all the branches of dome&s;tic cleanline&s;s, and keep foul ve&s;&s;els at a di&s;tance from our wharves, war may rage in the We&s;t-Indies,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of all the explications, which have been hitherto given for the exi&s;tence of our late epidemics, none has appeared to me, &s;o completely the child of fancy, as that, which attributes it to the prevalence of war in the We&s;t Indies. For my own part, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I am not able to di&s;cover any more nece&s;&s;ary phy&s;ical connection between war in the We&s;t Indies, and pe&s;tilence in America, than between coach-making in Philadelphia, and button-making in London!</NOTE> till the pa&s;&s;ions of man begin to langui&s;h, and the ambition of nations be|come exhau&s;ted, and the yellow-fever may there &s;pread de|&s;olation from i&s;land to i&s;land, yet, &s;till, amid this deplora|ble wreck and confu&s;ion, will our city remain exempt from an epidemic pe&s;tilence! Whereas, on the other hand, if the&s;e requi&s;ites be not attended to,&mdash;if our city and &s;ub|urbs be &s;uffered to continue immer&s;ed in their pre&s;ent filth, and ve&s;&s;els be allowed to di&s;embogue their pe&s;tilential va|pours along our wharves, though the We&s;t Indies &s;hould be converted into an Eden of peace, fragrance, and healthful|ne&s;s, and though the &s;eeds of pe&s;tilence, &s;hould be, for ever, bla&s;ted along the &s;hores of A&s;ia, and Africa, yet &s;till, will Philadelphia&mdash;haple&s;s Philadelphia, remain &s;ubject to a rei|teration of the melancholy &s;cenes of ninety three, ninety &s;even, and ninety eight!</P>

<HEAD>A SEMI-ANNUAL ORATION, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SIGNED>MR. PRESIDENT AND GENTLEMEN,</SIGNED></OPENER>
<P>IN ri&s;ing to addre&s;s you on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ions my feelings impel me to a two-fold acknowledgment&mdash;An acknowledgment for the unexpected honour, with which I have been di&s;tingui&s;hed, in your appointing me to prepare and deliver the fir&s;t of the &s;emiannual addre&s;&s;es enjoined by our con&s;titution; and a mo&s;t cordial acknowledgment for the liberal indulgence, which I experienced from you, on a former occa&s;ion, when indi&s;po&s;ition interfered, and, by fru&s;|trating my attempt to comply with my engagement, di&s;|appointed, for the time, the expectations of the Academy.</P>
<P>Would that I could &s;uffer my exordium to terminate here! But circum&s;tances forbid that this &s;hould be the ca&s;e. The plea&s;ure of <HI>acknowledgment</HI> I mu&s;t now exchange for the ta&s;k of <HI>apology.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="035263_0011_1001B409580D3DE8">In behalf of the following performance, I would addre&s;s my|&s;elf, not to that rigid, unaccommodating ju&s;tice in critici&s;m, which I have rea&s;on to believe mo&s;t of you have at com|mand, but to that forbearance and clemency, of which, I, am well a&s;&s;ured, you are all po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. I mu&s;t &s;olicit you to extend to the &s;ub&s;equent oration, &s;ome &s;hare of that par|tiality, with which, on various occa&s;ions, you have honour|ed the Orator. Let me not be di&s;appointed in flattering my&s;elf, that the u&s;ual benevolence of your natures will throw, at lea&s;t, &s;ome &s;hadow of palliation over &s;uch faults as the clearne&s;s of your under&s;tandings will inevitably di&s;|cover, and the ju&s;tne&s;s of your &s;entiments oblige you to condemn.</P>
<P>Suffer it to operate in mitigation of your impending &s;en|tence, when I a&s;&s;ure you, that the following addre&s;s was prepared and numerous avocations, of a nature more than u&s;ually unfavourable to &s;ucce&s;s in compo&s;ition. But &s;ati&s;|fied that I have more&mdash;much more, to expect from the in|genuous liberality of your minds, than from the humble me|rit of my own defence, I will no longer addre&s;s you in the language of apology. Part of the imperfections of the ora|tion I am about to deliver, ari&s;e no le&s;s from want of abilities, than from want of lei&s;ure. A portion of the cen&s;ure mu&s;t, therefore, in ju&s;tice, re&s;t on your&s;elves, for not having been more circum&s;pect in your choice of an orator.</P>
<P>It was my intention to have paid in this place, a pa&s;&s;ing tri|bute to the memory of our two decea&s;ed friends and fellow-members, Dr. Sayre and Dr. Cooper. I had even prepared
<PB N="15" REF="035263_0012_1001B40DED818940">
my&s;elf for the di&s;charge of this mournful duty. Impre&s;&s;ed by re&s;pect for the talents and learning, and by &s;entiments of e&s;teem and friend&s;hip for the numerous virtues of tho&s;e two medical philo&s;ophers, I was unwilling to neglect &s;o fair an opportunity of expre&s;&s;ing my &s;en&s;e of their di&s;tin|gui&s;hed worth. Being &s;uperceded however, in this duty, by a very judicious and re&s;pectful appointment of the Academy, for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of doing ju&s;tice to their memories, I &s;hall pa&s;s in &s;ilence over the melancholy &s;ubject. But when the name of Cooper, in particular, is mentioned, to &s;uffer oblivious &s;ilence to u&s;urp the place of de&s;criptive and ju&s;t eulogium, is, with me, no incon&s;iderable effort of &s;elf-re&s;traint. On &s;uch an occa&s;ion my feelings would prompt me to a far different conduct. As I have ever ranked the acqui&s;ition of the friend&s;hip of this gentleman among the mo&s;t fortunate occurrences of my life, it will not be thought &s;trange, that I &s;hould feel an inclination to contri|bute my mite to the immen&s;e trea&s;ure of re&s;pect, which his numerous acquaintance will pay to his memory. But an indulgence of my feelings on this occa&s;ion, would lead to an unwarrantable digre&s;&s;ion from what I propo&s;e as the im|mediate &s;ubject of my addre&s;s.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of attempting, therefore, to cheri&s;h in your brea&s;ts a kind, but unavailing &s;orrow for the dead, allow me to &s;olicit your attention to a few general ob&s;ervations relative to the origin of pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es. I &s;hall after|wards confine my remarks and &s;peculations more immedi|ately to the origin of that di&s;ea&s;e, who&s;e ravages and con|comitant
<PB N="16" REF="035263_0013_1001B4140F9E0818">
terrors, have thrice, of late, reduced the gay and crouded &s;treets of our city to a di&s;mal &s;cene of de&s;olation and &s;olitude.</P>
<P>As my &s;ubject is, evidently, very exten&s;ive and copious, &s;hould I even engro&s;s a little more of your time than you at pre&s;ent anticipate, I hope you will bear, with a patient indulgence, the unintentional but unavoidable tre&s;pa&s;s.</P>
<P>It is, in this place, worthy of remark, that <HI>Pestilence</HI> has been, at all times, treated by the world, as an illigiti|mate child, without an acknowledged parent&mdash;in other words, as a plant perfectly exotic as to every inhabited &s;oil and climate&mdash;or as a phy&s;ical evil, exi&s;ting in almo&s;t every region, yet (&s;trange incon&s;i&s;tency!) originating in none!</P>
<P>It is a fact not more &s;ingular than true, that, there is not to be found in the whole range of the globe, a &s;ingle country, which is acknowledged by its own inhabitants, to be the immediate birth-place of pe&s;tilence. When this dreadful &s;courge makes its appearance in any place, howe|ver favourable, from climate and local cau&s;es, to its dome&s;|tic generation, its exi&s;tence never fails to be attributed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i|to <HI>introduction</HI> by land, or <HI>importation</HI> by &s;ea, from &s;ome foreign country. As it, for the mo&s;t part, appears fir&s;t in large commercial cities, the latter of the&s;e is mo&s;t com|monly con&s;idered as the channel of its conveyance. Hence the evils of pe&s;tilence have been generally charged to the account of commerce. Thus, when the plague prevails in
<PB N="17" REF="035263_0014_1001B41A971F9228">
any part of Europe, it is uniformly a&s;&s;erted to have been imported in merchandize from A&s;ia. When it breaks out in the latter place, where it not unfrequently depopu|lates towns and villages, and, occa&s;ionally, lays even whole countries wa&s;te, it is always traced, or what, with the in|dolent and unthinking natives, amounts to the &s;ame thing, is &s;uppo&s;ed to be traced to &s;ome communication with the continent of Africa. But the hardy &s;ons of this burning climate, &s;purn, with indignation, what they con&s;ider not on|ly as an in&s;ult to the healthfulne&s;s, but al&s;o as an injury to the pro&s;perity of their country, and contend, that the plague is never generated with them, but is always intro|duced from &s;ome di&s;tant quarter. Nor is this ob&s;tinate &s;pirit of reluctance in the human race to admit pe&s;tilence to be a native of the &s;ame &s;oil and climate with them&s;elves, confined to the continent of the old world. But five years ago, the &s;ame thing might have been &s;aid with re&s;pect to mo&s;t of the inhabitants of the United States. Few of them could then be induced to believe, that the we&s;tern &s;hores of the Atlantic could po&s;&s;ibly give birth to a pe&s;ti|lential di&s;ea&s;e. They &s;eemed to &s;uppo&s;e, that a phy&s;ical evil of &s;uch a magnitude, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be the growth of a foregn climate, not &s;o highly favoured by heaven as their own.</P>
<P>To you, Gentlemen, it is &s;carcely nece&s;&s;ary for me to ob&s;erve, that this unwillingne&s;s in mankind to acknowledge pe&s;tilence to be a native of the &s;ame country with them|&s;elves, &s;hould be viewed as an inveterate prejudice, &s;up|ported,
<PB N="18" REF="035263_0015_1001B422472BA9B0">
like all other prejudices, by the two gothic pillars of <HI>ignorance</HI> and <HI>error.</HI> It requires no uncommon depth of logic to prove, that pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es, having an exi&s;|tence, mu&s;t have al&s;o a place of origin; and, that this place, mu&s;t be in &s;ome of the inhabited parts of the earth. But &s;o extraordinary and ab&s;urd is the prejudice, of which I have &s;poken, that it literally denies the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es to have originated in any place. Taking the &s;entiments of man|kind, on this &s;ubject, for our guide, we would find a &s;earch after the real birth-place of pe&s;tilence equally abortive with the poet's &s;earch after the North, which he &s;o energetically repre&s;ents in the following lines.
<Q><L>But where th' extreme of vice was ne'er agreed;</L>
<L>A&s;k, Where's the North? at York 'tis on the Tweed;</L>
<L>In Scotland, at the Orcades, and there,</L>
<L>At Greenland, Zembla, or the Lord knows where!</L></Q>
So it is with re&s;pect to the birth-place of pe&s;tilence. In America it is in the We&s;t-Indies; in the We&s;t-Indies, it is, at one time, at Siam in the Ea&s;t-Indies; and again at Boulam in Africa; while, at the&s;e places, it is &s;till farther to the <HI>east</HI> as if the ri&s;ing was capable of exalting the poi&s;on of putrefaction to higher malignity than even the mid-day &s;un. Were not the &s;ubject too &s;erious to be treated as a je&s;t, I would farther &s;ay, that this &s;ingular ab&s;urdity, in mo&s;t men, with re&s;pect to the birth-place of pe&s;tilence, brings to my recollection the humourous &s;tory of Gold&s;mith's pauper, who, in que&s;t of the real or acknowledged place of his birth,

(the place where, by the municipal regulations of his coun|try, he was entitled to a &s;ub&s;i&s;tance for life,) was carted about from pari&s;h to pari&s;h, till, to u&s;e the poor fellow's own words, he "thought in his &s;oul, they would not al|low that he had been born in any pari&s;h at all."</P>
<P>Let us, for a moment, trace this prejudice through all its windings to its fountain head. It &s;prings from the bo&s;om of <HI>self-love.</HI> This real though &s;ecret principle of all our &s;entiments, opinions, and actions, will not &s;uffer us to admit, that we our&s;elves can be the &s;ource of any thing evil, or of any thing di&s;a&s;trous. From our&s;elves we are inclined to extend this favourable opinion to our friends, acquaintance, and countrymen; and from them, to the air which we breathe, the &s;oil which gave us birth, and even to the waters which variegate the land&s;capes that &s;urround us. The &s;ame &s;elfi&s;h principles&mdash;the &s;ame contracted &s;pi|rit, which led the reprobate Jews of old to exclaim, "Can any thing good come out of Galilee" induces the more fa|voured, but, in &s;ome re&s;pects, not much more enlightened, moderns to a&s;k, can any thing evil originate in our beloved country?</P>
<P>This prejudice, re&s;pecting the origin of pe&s;tilential di&s;|ea&s;es, derives no incon&s;iderable &s;upport from the operation of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> but powerful principle of &s;elf-intere&s;t.

prove injurious to its population and pro&s;perity, and that, con&s;equently our intere&s;ts as individuals mu&s;t &s;uffer. This however, is a mi&s;taken fear. General <HI>truth</HI> and general <HI>utility</HI> are &s;worn friends, and in&s;eparable companions. Nor are they more &s;o, in any in&s;tance, than in that which claims our pre&s;ent attention. The &s;ame enlightened views in &s;ci|ence which declare, that pe&s;tilence may originate among our&s;elves, afford us, at the &s;ame time, the mo&s;t firm and con&s;olatory a&s;&s;urance, that we have in our own hands the means of prevention and &s;afety. Nor is this our only con|&s;olation. Were phy&s;ical truth, on this &s;ubject, fully evolv|ed, it would &s;et mo&s;t, if not all countries and climates, nearly on a level with re&s;pect to the origin of pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es. For I am per&s;uaded that there exi&s;ts not a &s;pot on the &s;urface of the globe, which may not, under certain, circum&s;tances, become capable of giving birth to the&s;e wa&s;teful epidemics.</P>
<P>I beg it may not, from the foregoing ob&s;ervations, be under&s;tood, that I mean, on the &s;ubject of the origin of pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es, to accu&s;e the whole human race of ig|norance and error. Far from it&mdash;There have, at all times, exi&s;ted many di&s;tingui&s;hed in&s;tances of exemption from &s;uch a charge.

<P><PB N="21" REF="035263_0018_1001B434AD602A48">This is well known to have been formerly the ca&s;e, in London and Mar&s;eilles, during the unparalelled calamities inflicted by pe&s;tilence on tho&s;e two ancient and populous cities. Nor was it of late, le&s;s remarkably the ca&s;e in dif|ferent parts of the United States, but more particularly in the city of Philadelphia. When the Yellow Fever (which might with more propriety have been denominated the <HI>A|merican pestilence)</HI> made its appearance in this city in the autumn of ninety three, to have &s;aid that it was a di&s;ea&s;e of dome&s;tic origin, was con&s;idered as an unfounded &s;lander on our climate, and the man, who dared to advocate &s;uch an opinion, was viewed in the light of an enemy to his coun|try.

The dawn of that day has already reached us, and we have eve|ry rea&s;on to believe, that we will very &s;hortly be wrapt in its full meridian.</P>
<P>The opinion, that our late epidemic mu&s;t be nece&s;&s;arily imported to us from a tropical climate, will &s;oon become as unpopular as it was once exten&s;ive. Already is it greatly circum&s;cribed in its limits&mdash;Already is it confined almo&s;t entirely to tho&s;e, who were originally active and clamorous

in its &s;upport. By &s;uch characters we are not to expect that it will be immediately abandoned. They have already pledged them&s;elves to the world for its &s;upport, and con&s;i|der, therefore, its fate as in &s;ome mea&s;ure interwoven with the fate of their own characters, as philo&s;ophers in medi|cine. Like a parent, with all his tenderne&s;s awakened by the approaching di&s;&s;olution of a beloved child, they will cling to it with the greater fondne&s;s, the more nearly they &s;ee it about to expire.

<P>We have already ob&s;erved, that in all parts of the world, and in all periods of &s;ociety, mankind, in general, have en|tertained and exhibited a mo&s;t profound ho&s;tility again&s;t the opinion of their own country being, under any circum&s;tan|ces, the birth-place of pe&s;tilence. Nor has the matter end|ed here. They have been &s;olicitous and active to defend, not only their own immediate country, but even our whole globe, from the charge of giving origin to an evil of &s;uch magnitude. Whenever this di&s;ea&s;e has appeared, they have, like many phy&s;icians and citizens of the United States, been extremely anxious and indu&s;trious to trace it to &s;ome par|ticular &s;pecies of importation. It may not be altogether u&s;ele&s;s nor unintere&s;ting, to trace the many &s;ingular and ab|&s;urd
<PB N="23" REF="035263_0020_1001AEA241386C78">
modifications, through which this opinion, of the <HI>fo|reign importation</HI> of pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es, has &s;ucce&s;&s;ively pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>In the earlie&s;t ages of the world, when ignorance and &s;uper&s;tition led men to attribute all extraordinary pheno|mena to the direct agency of &s;upernatural beings, pe&s;tilence was &s;uppo&s;ed to be imported immediately from Heaven. This is the opinion which appears to have prevailed among the ancient Hebrews, and may be ranked at the head of the catalogue of ab&s;urdities on this &s;ubject. The domini|on of prejudice over the minds of that ignorant and ob&s;ti|nate people, appears in this in&s;tance particularly &s;triking. Such was the depth of their blind bigotry in favour of the healthfulne&s;s of the globe they inhabited, that they would &s;eem to have con&s;idered it as even &s;uperior to that of the cele&s;tial regions. Hence, unwilling, to believe that their favourite earth could give origin to an evil &s;o dreadful as pe&s;tilence, they imported the &s;eeds of this calamity from the more unhealthful climate of heaven!!</P>
<P>Another &s;pecies of <HI>importation</HI> no le&s;s extraordinary than the former, is that which derived pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es from the &s;un. An opinion of this kind appears to have been en|tertained, re&s;pecting the origin of that pe&s;tilence, which de|&s;olated the Grecian camp before the walls of Troy.</P>
<P>Another de&s;cription of importation from di&s;tant worlds remains yet to be mentioned. During that period of error,
<PB N="24" REF="035263_0021_1001B44596CCF5B8">
in which the &s;cience of medicine, in common with mo&s;t other branches of &s;cience, was deeply perverted by a&s;trolo|gical notions, not one of the planets (our own perhaps ex|cepted!) e&s;caped the charge of giving origin to pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es. Thus Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Mer|cury, may all be found arraigned in the dark catalogue. Nor did the moon her&s;elf e&s;cape. Even the celebrated, but fanciful Paracel&s;us, boldly accu&s;ed this fair luminary, as being the parent of deadly pe&s;tilence.&mdash;Had nature, pre|viou&s;ly to this period of intellectual perver&s;ion, by a happy effort, rai&s;ed up a Her&s;chel, to &s;oar, an a&s;tronomical Colum|bus, through the immen&s;ity of &s;pace, there is little doubt, but that the orb, which now bears his name, would, even from its di&s;tant bourne, have been called to the narrow bar of human prejudice, to an&s;wer to the charge of having been the birth-place and nur&s;ery of the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e!</P>
<P>In &s;upport of the foregoing opinions, however irrational and ab&s;urd in the view of a more enlightened age, our re|mote ance&s;tors appear to have acted in concert. Such was their blind partiality in favour of the world they inhabited, that they could not, for a moment, admit the belief of its ever giving ri&s;e to true pe&s;tilence. At length, however, were they forced to abandon the ground they had originally taken&mdash;At length was this extraordinary meta&s;ti&s;is of error obliged to relinqui&s;h entirely the heavenly bodies, and fix on earth as its final retreat. At this period men became divided in their opinion, re&s;pecting the origin of the evil in que&s;tion. Obliged to acknowledge it as a native of our
<PB N="25" REF="035263_0022_1001AEB4A255EAC0">
own globe, they commenced a zealous &s;earch for the parti|cular &s;oil and climate from which it &s;prang. Here it was that their opinions became ho&s;tile. Each one de&s;irous of pre&s;erving, in purity, the character of his own country, charged the birth of pe&s;tilence to the country of another. Nor has the controver&s;y as yet &s;ub&s;ided. We have &s;een very evident traces of it in the re&s;earches of men after the origin of that malignant pe&s;tilence, by which we have, lately, been three times vi&s;ited. Thus, in America, the We&s;t India I&s;lands were, at fir&s;t, con&s;idered as its birth|place. Some phy&s;icians, in the We&s;t Indies, on the other hand, attribute its prevalence there to importation from the coa&s;t of Africa. While, no doubt, the hardy African will retort the charge, and &s;ay, that they are indebted, for this di&s;ea&s;e, to the lawle&s;s intru&s;ion of white men on their peace|ful &s;hores. Thus we &s;ee that the &s;ame illiberal &s;pirit of prejudice which, in the earlier ages of the world, induced our forefathers to attribute the origin of pe&s;tilence to hea|ven, to the &s;un, the moon, and the various planetary bodies, &s;till continues, though under a different form, among their more highly favoured po&s;terity. They went to di&s;tant worlds in que&s;t of the origin of this di&s;ea&s;e, whereas we re&s;t &s;atisfied with &s;horter excur&s;ions, and travel only to di&s;tant countries!</P>
<P>I have called that prejudice, which leads to remote parts of the globe, in que&s;t of the origin of pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es, an illiberal one; nor am I at all inclined to retract the epithet. I think it narrow and illiberal, becau&s;e it frequently urges
<PB N="26" REF="035263_0023_1001B454F2AA0050">
men on to defend the character of their own climate and country, at the expence of that of other places, which na|ture has favoured with equal advantages. As formerly ob&s;erved, the very &s;ame principle of illiberality which leads us to deny, to other portions of the globe, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of advantages and excellencies which they undoubtedly hold, induces us al&s;o to load them with the imputation of evils, from which they an wholly exempt. This is a principle which the enlightened Americans &s;hould indignantly re|nounce. From its undue operation, in the minds of Euro|peans, they them&s;elves have already &s;uffered much. There was a time when America was con&s;idered, by mo&s;t Euro|peans, as capable of giving birth to but little that was va|luable. And &s;hall we, now, actuated by the &s;ame narrow principle, and governed by the &s;ame circum&s;cribed views, contend, that it can give origin to nothing embraced in the catalogue of evils? I flatter my&s;elf with a confidence that we never will. For though proud and happy in the belief, that the wi&s;dom and &s;pirit of Americans will be at all times competent and prompt to defend our country and its character from every de&s;cription of in&s;ult and inju&s;tice, I &s;hould yet be &s;orry and humiliated at the appear|ance of a &s;elfi&s;h national &s;pirit, inclining us to the defama|tion of other countries, for the illiberal purpo&s;e of adding a &s;uperior lu&s;tre to our own!</P>
<P>From arguments to be laid before you in a &s;ub&s;equent part of this addre&s;s, it will I tru&s;t appear, that America is,
<PB N="27" REF="035263_0024_1001B45B16C5A6A0">
equally with other parts of the world, capable of giving birth to the wor&s;t of di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the opinion, that our late pe&s;tilence is nece&s;&s;arily imported from the We&s;t Indies, it is with plea&s;ure I ob&s;erve, that its relinqui&s;hment has already very evident|ly commenced. Even &s;ome of its mo&s;t &s;trenuous advocates have found it nece&s;&s;ary, in attempting its defence, to aban|don entirely their original ground. They, at fir&s;t, con|tended that the &s;eeds of this di&s;ea&s;e were imported to us in the form of <HI>human contagion</HI> only, adhering to the clothes or bodies of &s;eamen or pa&s;&s;engers, or to the timbers, appa|rel, or contents of ve&s;&s;els. This however, con&s;titutes no longer an article in their medical creed. They are now willing to al|low, that the &s;eeds of the di&s;ea&s;e may be brought, not only under the form of <HI>human contagion,</HI> but al&s;o under that of <HI>foul air,</HI> produced by a high &s;tate of putrefaction in the ve&s;|&s;el's balla&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r cargo. This mu&s;t be granted by all, to be a very <HI>material,</HI> and you will indulge me in adding, a very <HI>auspicious</HI> change of opinion. But the change will not &s;top here. Having &s;o far relinqui&s;hed their original ground as to allow, that the <HI>American Pestilence</HI> can originate from putrefaction in the hold of a ve&s;&s;el at &s;ea, they will next accede to the propo&s;ition, that it may, under certain circum&s;tances, re&s;ult from a &s;imilar proce&s;s on &s;hore. Hence the warmer regions of North America will, in all proba|bility, be next &s;u&s;pected of giving birth to the formidable di&s;ea&s;e in que&s;tion. But at this point opinion will not re|main &s;tationary. The change will &s;till continue to progre&s;s,
<PB N="28" REF="035263_0025_1001B46134B6B0A0">
till, at length, when the &s;hades of error and prejudice &s;hall have been entirely di&s;&s;ipated, each citizen of Phila|delphia will &s;ee the principal cau&s;e of the pe&s;tilence that afflicts him, not in the immediate hand of a benevolent Deity&mdash;not in the malign a&s;pect of the &s;un, the moon, or the planetary bodies&mdash;not on the burning &s;hores of Africa or the We&s;t Indies, but in the very centre of his own city!</P>
<P>Indulge me, for a few moments, in a detail of the lead|ing arguments, which induce me to con&s;ider our pe&s;tilenti|al di&s;ea&s;es as the genuine offspring of our own country.</P>
<P>Pe&s;tilence can become epidemic only, when aided by a concurrent con&s;titution of Atmo&s;phere. This po&s;ition is founded on the collective experience of ages. Where &s;uch a con&s;titution does not prevail, &s;poradic ca&s;es of pe&s;tilence may indeed occur, but they will again di&s;appear, and leave &s;urrounding individuals unhurt. The nature of that pecu|liar &s;tate of atmo&s;phere, favourable to the propagation of pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es, has hitherto eluded the re&s;earches of philo&s;ophers. The reality of its exi&s;tence, however, is &s;uf|ficiently e&s;tabli&s;hed from the obvious effects to which it gives ri&s;e. Though ridiculed, of late, by &s;ome phy&s;icians, under the denomination of an <HI>occult</HI> quality, rea&s;on and ob&s;ervation &s;till declare it to be a quality re&s;ting, for the certainty of its exi&s;tence, on evidence as &s;ub&s;tantial, as that which &s;upports the great Newtonian principle, the gravi|tation of all terre&s;trial bodies.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="035263_0026_1001B46756B00B60">A pe&s;tilential con&s;titution of atmo&s;phere may be either <HI>general</HI> or <HI>local.</HI> The general is that which extends over whole countries, &s;ometimes even over entire continents, and, for the mo&s;t part, prolongs its duration for &s;everal &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive years. The local is confined to particular &s;pots, mo&s;t commonly to large commercial cities, and terminates with the di&s;appearance of certain topical cau&s;es, which ge|nerally po&s;&s;e&s;s but a &s;hort lived exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>Various opinions have been entertained, by philo&s;ophers, re&s;pecting the cau&s;e of this general pe&s;tilential con&s;titution. By &s;o me, it has been attributed to a general and permanent exhalation, perhaps of a mineral nature, re&s;ulting from the action of &s;ubterraneous fires; by others, to an immen&s;e volume of poi&s;onous gas, forcibly di&s;charged from the bow|els of the earth, during the dreadful con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;ions of an earth-quake; and by others again, to torrents of pe&s;tiferous air eject|ed into the atmo&s;phere from the craters of Volcanos. In &s;up|port of the&s;e two latter opinions, &s;ome degree of evidence is derived from the circum&s;tance of the prevalence of pe&s;ti|lence, being very often either preceded or accompanied by the occurrence of earth-quakes, or by repeated and dread|ful volcanic eruptions. Of the frequent and &s;triking coin|cidence, both in point of time and place, between the exi&s;t|ence of pe&s;tilence and the occurrence of earth-quakes and eruptions from volcanos, the records of medicine afford am|ple proof. An unan&s;werable argument in favour of the reality of this general con&s;titution of atmo&s;phere, is derived from the frequent (I had almo&s;t &s;aid uniform) cotemporary
<PB N="30" REF="035263_0027_1001B46BECF961C8">
prevalence of pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es, in different and di&s;tant parts of the globe.</P>
<P>That &s;uch a general con&s;titution of atmo&s;phere may exi&s;t in America, as well as in other places, is a po&s;ition, which, ab&s;tractly con&s;idered, we have no rea&s;on to doubt. And that it even does actually prevail, at this time, is an opinion entertained by many re&s;pectable characters, and &s;upported by various phy&s;ical phenomena. On a full and minute &s;tatement of the&s;e phenomena, time will not &s;uffer me, at pre&s;ent, to enter. I flatter my&s;elf, however, that the fol|lowing facts, relative to this curious and intere&s;ting &s;ub|ject, will not be deemed unworthy the attention of the Academy.</P>
<P>For &s;ome years pa&s;t, &s;everal &s;pecies of in&s;ects, who&s;e ex|i&s;tence is known no be intimately connected with the &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere, have been more than u&s;ually abundant in our country. Of the truth of this, our farmers are able to furni&s;h us with but too many unequivocal and, to them, expen&s;ive te&s;timonies. It will require many years to obli|terate from the memory of this u&s;eful and re&s;pectable cla&s;s of our fellow-citizens, the injuries they have &s;u&s;tained from the inva&s;ion and ravages of the <HI>Hessian Fly.</HI></P>
<P>The origin of this de&s;tructive in&s;ect has, like that of our late epidemic, con&s;tituted a &s;ubject of &s;peculation and doubt, among the literary characters of the United States. While &s;ome have traced it to foreign importation, others have contended that it is a native of our own country. Were I to lay
<PB N="31" REF="035263_0028_1001B473973200E8">
before you the re&s;ult of my own enquiries and reflection on this point of natural hi&s;tory, I &s;hould be inclined to advo|cate the latter opinion. I am rather di&s;po&s;ed to believe, that what is vulgarly denominated the He&s;&s;ian Fly origi|nates entirely with our&s;elves. There is rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, that our fields and fore&s;ts contain, perhaps, at all times, this in&s;ect in certain members, and that it &s;uperabounds, and, depredates on the labours of the hu&s;bandman in tho&s;e &s;ea|&s;ons only, during which there prevails a &s;tate or con&s;titu|tion of atmo&s;phere, more peculiarly favourable to its propa|gation and exi&s;tence. For it is a fact well known to natu|rali&s;ts, that no le&s;s in the oeconomy of in&s;ects than in that of plants, certain &s;ea&s;ons are favourable, and others unfa|vourable to their generation and growth.</P>
<P>Again, it is a fact, with which men of ob&s;ervation, can|not be unacquainted, that for &s;everal years pa&s;t, but more particularly during the la&s;t and preceding autumns, mu&s;ki|tos were more than u&s;ually abundant in tho&s;e &s;ituations which they generally infe&s;t&mdash;Nor is this all&mdash;The&s;e in&s;ects, not willing to be confined, during the two la&s;t &s;ea&s;ons, to their former limits, made their way into many places, which, before, had been almo&s;t wholly exempt from their inva&s;ion. But from the well known circum&s;tance, that mu&s;kitos uni|formly abound at the &s;ame time, and in the &s;ame places, with epidemic bilious fevers, we are very fairly authorized to conclude, that the&s;e noxious in&s;ects depend, for their ex|i&s;tence, on an in&s;alubrious &s;tate and con&s;titution of atmo&s;|phere. Nor mu&s;t I here omit to ob&s;erve, that the immen|&s;ity
<PB N="32" REF="035263_0029_1001B47B405E3530">
of gra&s;s-hoppers, which infe&s;ted our country, during la&s;t &s;ummer, be&s;poke a condition of atmo&s;phere different from what u&s;ually prevails at that &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>If then our country has, of late, been characterized by an unu&s;ual prevalence of in&s;ects and of di&s;ea&s;e in different places, and if the&s;e in&s;ects and di&s;ea&s;e have, in mo&s;t in&s;tan|ces, prevailed, not only at the &s;ame time, but al&s;o in the &s;ame &s;ituations, (both of which facts are unque&s;tionably true) have we not, at lea&s;t, a very o&s;ten&s;ible ground of belief, that the&s;e unu&s;ual and cotemporary phenomena proceed from the &s;ame cau&s;e, and that this cau&s;e is no other than a &s;tate and con&s;titution of our atmo&s;phere, different from tho&s;e that u&s;ually characterize the atmo&s;phere of our country?</P>
<P>In corroboration of the preceding inference, namely, that the &s;ame con&s;titution of atmo&s;phere, which favours the prevalence of pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es, is, in like manner, fa|vourable to the exi&s;tence of in&s;ects, I beg leave to give a brief &s;tatement and explanation of an intere&s;ting fact, which, we learn from the hi&s;tory of former ages. For more than fifty years, during the reign of the emperor Ju&s;tinian, the plague raged in Europe, A&s;ia and Africa, with &s;uch unpa|ralelled violence and malignity, as &s;ometimes to threaten, in appearance, even the depopulation of the whole earth. Throughout this period of deva&s;tation and calamity, &s;uch was the immen&s;ity of locu&s;ts which infe&s;ted the countries where the pe&s;tilence prevailed, that many were di&s;po&s;ed to attribute the exi&s;tence of this di&s;ea&s;e to the death and pu|trefaction
<PB N="33" REF="035263_0030_1001B47FD6C452C8">
of the&s;e de&s;tructive in&s;ects. This latter opinion, however, we conceive to be founded, in a great mea&s;ure, in error. For although the pe&s;tilential con&s;titution of at|mo&s;phere was, no doubt, &s;trengthened by the deleterious gas, ari&s;ing from the putrefactive di&s;&s;olution of &s;uch an im|men&s;e volume of animal matter, it is by no means likely that it re&s;ulted from this as its primary cau&s;e. There ex|i&s;ts certain facts which render it much more probable, that the &s;ame con&s;titution of atmo&s;phere, re&s;ulting originally from &s;ome more powerful &s;ource, proved favourable, at once, to the generation of locu&s;ts, and to the birth and propaga|tion of the pe&s;tilence of the age.</P>
<P>Might not a like phy&s;ical explanation be given of the cau&s;e of &s;everal of the plagues, which &s;acred writ declares to have vi&s;ited, in ancient times, the incorrigible Egypti|ans; and which were then &s;uppo&s;ed, to have been inflicted by the immediate hand of the Deity? I allude particularly to the de&s;tructive &s;warms of locu&s;ts, and flies, and to the pe&s;tilence among men, and the murrain among cattle, two di&s;ea&s;es, which appear to be intimately connected. Is it not, I &s;ay, at lea&s;t, an admi&s;&s;ible conjecture, that there prevailed, at that time, a certain pe&s;tilential con&s;titution of atmo&s;phere, which operated as the leading phy&s;ical cau&s;e of all the&s;e evils? The profound darkne&s;s which, &s;hortly afterwards, over&s;hadowed, for a time, the dominions of the impious and tyrannical Pharaoh, was probably nothing more than a natural concomitant of the &s;ame con&s;titution.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="035263_0031_1001B4846CEFA598">That there was &s;omething peculiar and uncommon, in the general &s;tate and condition of the air, during our epide|mics of ninety three, ninety &s;even, and ninety eight, we would deduce from the va&s;t number of fiery meteors, (com|monly denominated falling or &s;hooting &s;tars) which appear|ed in our atmo&s;phere during tho&s;e periods. I think it highly probable, that the&s;e blazing meteors, always abound during the exi&s;tence of a pe&s;tilential con&s;titution of atmo&s;|phere, and that on their uniform appearance, &s;uper&s;tition has erected a belief, that certain &s;trange and &s;upernatural phenomena in the heavens, never fail to give premonition of the approach of pe&s;tilence.</P>
<P>As a farther evidence in favour of the exi&s;tence of a pe|culiar con&s;titution of atmo&s;phere, particularly during the years ninety three and ninety eight, it de&s;erves to be men|tioned, that, in tho&s;e years, the fruits of our country, in general, ripened and rotted with much more than their u&s;ual rapidity. And that, on many of our fruit trees, &s;e|cond crops of blo&s;&s;oms appeared early in the autumn of the &s;ame years, and, on &s;ome of them, even &s;econd crops of fruit made con&s;iderable advances toward maturity. Nor could the occurrence of the&s;e phenomena be fairly deduced from the exi&s;tence of any peculiarity in the &s;en&s;ible quali|ties of the atmo&s;phere. Sea&s;ons as warm and dry as tho&s;e, to which I have referred, are not uniformly productive of &s;imilar effects. To the agency, therefore, of &s;ome imper|ceptible cau&s;e in our atmo&s;phere, mu&s;t we attribute the &s;everal phenomena in que&s;tion.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="035263_0032_1001B48C167B8DE0">Another unan&s;werable argument in favour of the occa|&s;ional exi&s;tence of a general morbid con&s;titution of atmo&s;|phere in our country, is derived from the exten&s;ive preva|lence of the catarrhal fever (commonly denominated in|fluenza) in the years eighty eight and eighty nine. This di&s;ea&s;e, which I believe is acknowledged by all to have re|&s;ulted from a certain deleterious con&s;titution or &s;tate of the air we in&s;pired, was &s;o general, as to pervade every part of the United States. But the con&s;titution, from which it originated, mu&s;t have been, in like manner, general, being nece&s;&s;arily co-exten&s;ive with the di&s;ea&s;e it&s;elf. During part of the continuance of this catarrhal con&s;titution, a deep du&s;kine&s;s, or want of due tran&s;parency in the atmo&s;|phere, con&s;iderably ob&s;cured the &s;un, in many, if not mo&s;t, parts of our country, thus con&s;tituting an approach toward Egyptian darkne&s;s, which, as formerly ob&s;erved, was, pro|bably, nothing more than a natural effect or concomitant of the then exi&s;ting pe&s;tilential con&s;titution.</P>
<P>The cau&s;es, which give ri&s;e to that <HI>local constitution</HI> of atmo&s;phere, favourable to the generation and propagation of pe&s;tilence, are by far more obvious in their nature, operate on a much le&s;s enten&s;ive &s;cale, and po&s;&s;e&s;s an exi&s;tence by no means &s;o durable. They are principally confined to large cities, camps, and garri&s;ons, where multitudes of people are crowded together, and where per&s;onal and other de&s;cripti|ons of cleanline&s;s do not receive the attention they merit. They may be &s;aid, in general, to be, all &s;uch cau&s;es as tend, in the above de&s;criptions of places, to generate foul air, and
<PB N="36" REF="035263_0033_1001B48F2562A5F0">
thus produce a vitiated &s;tate of atmo&s;phere. The principal of the&s;e &s;hall hereafter become &s;ubjects of particular &s;peci|fication. This local con&s;titution of atmo&s;phere extends, frequently, beyond the immediate confines of cities, camps and garri&s;ons, and, &s;ometimes, even pervades con&s;iderable tracts of country, particularly &s;uch as are low and mar&s;hy. It is an evil, which may be &s;aid to owe its origin, in gene|ral, to that <HI>indolence</HI> and <HI>inattention,</HI> which unfortunately, con&s;titute &s;uch predominant traits in the character of the human race. This peculiar con&s;titution, of which we have &s;poken, is nothing el&s;e than a predi&s;po&s;ition or capability in the atmo&s;phere to generate and propagate pe&s;tilential di&s;|ea&s;es. It would &s;eem to con&s;i&s;t, either in the actual admix|ture of pe&s;tilential effluvia with the air which we breathe, or in the pre&s;ence of &s;ome aeriform &s;ub&s;tance, which favours the exi&s;tence and conveyance of &s;uch effluvia, and prevents their action from being de&s;troyed by the influence of the at|mo&s;phere.</P>
<P>Your attention, for a few moments, is next &s;olicited to the remote cau&s;e of pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es. It need &s;carcely be ob&s;erved, that this &s;ubject is very nearly allied to that of which we have la&s;t treated. So intimate, indeed, is their connection, that they might, without any impropriety, have been both &s;poken of under the &s;ame head. This remote cau&s;e may be defined, a gas of a highly poi&s;onous nature, which, when brought into contact with the human body, renders it liable, if expo&s;ed at the &s;ame time to the action of exciting cau&s;es, to an attack of the di&s;ea&s;e denominated pe&s;tilence.
<PB N="37" REF="035263_0034_1001B493C065DE20">
A knowledge of the peculiar phy&s;ical properties of this gas has hitherto remained, and, I fear, will very long continue to remain, an important de&s;ideratum in the &s;cience of me|dicine. Even the reality of its exi&s;tence is, as yet, e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, only, by its unparalelled ravages on the &s;y&s;tem of man, and on the &s;y&s;tems of a few &s;pecies of inferior animals. So extremely &s;ubtle and evane&s;cent is its nature, that we have not been able to &s;eparate it from &s;urrounding matter, to embody it together, and thus &s;ubject it to the te&s;t of ob&s;ervation and experiment.</P>
<P>A knowledge of the actual &s;ource of this pe&s;tilential va|pour is equally intere&s;ting to phy&s;ical &s;cience, and impor|tant to the welfare of the human race. Though it be po&s;|&s;ible that it may occa&s;ionally ari&s;e, in the form of exhala|tion, in con&s;equence of the action of &s;ubterraneous fires; and though it be probable that it has, in &s;ome in&s;tances, been thrown from the bowels of the earth, during the convul&s;ion of an earthquake, or the eruption of a volcano, yet the&s;e are by no means its mo&s;t frequent &s;ources. It appears to be now reduced to a certainty, as deci&s;ive as any exi&s;ting in phy&s;ical &s;cience, that organized bodies, in a high and long continued &s;tate of putrefaction, con&s;titute the legitimate parent of pe&s;tilential effluvia.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I have not thought proper to attempt a minute detail of all the evi|dence that might be collected in favour of the above po&s;ition. It is, by far, too exten&s;ive to be embodied within the nece&s;&s;ary limits of my addre&s;s. It maybe found mo&s;t copiou&s;ly diffu&s;ed through the works of all philo&s;ophical phy&s;icians, who have written expre&s;&s;ly on the &s;ubject of pe&s;tilence. A con|den&s;ed &s;tatement of it here, would be nothing more than a needle&s;s repeti|tion of what mu&s;t be familiar to the mind of every one, who has attended to the cultivation of the &s;cience of medicine. Ever &s;ince pe&s;tilence was fir&s;t acknowledged to be a native of our globe, it has been uniformly derived, by phy&s;icians of ob&s;ervation, from the poi&s;onous gas re&s;ulting from the putre|factive di&s;&s;olution of organized bodies. This would lead me to a few ob|&s;ervations on the &s;ubject of poi&s;ons.</P><P>This de&s;tructive cla&s;s of &s;ub&s;tances has been, generally, divided into the ani|mal, the vegetable and the mineral, to which &s;hould be added, that much more formidable de&s;cription of poi&s;on, derived originally from the proce&s;s of putrefaction. Under the&s;e four denomination, are embraced all the &s;pecies and varieties of poi&s;ons, that have hitherto attracted the notice of philo&s;ophers. That pe&s;tilential and infectious di&s;ea&s;es are the re&s;ult of poi|&s;onous effluvia, operating on the &s;y&s;tem of man, is a truth, to which medical characters have long given their a&s;&s;ent. An intere&s;ting que&s;tion would &s;eem to ari&s;e here, namely, to what denomination of poi&s;ons, do the&s;e effluvia appear to belong? It cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to be to the animal, the vegetable, or the mineral poi&s;ons, becau&s;e the&s;e deleterious &s;ub&s;tances have never been known, nor even &s;u&s;pected, to be capable of propagating them&s;elves. Thus, a per&s;on under the painful operation of an over-proportion of ar&s;enic, or of opium, or agonized by the bite of the rattle-&s;nake, is incapable of com|municating his di&s;ea&s;e to any of his attendants. The &s;ame thing may be &s;aid re&s;pecting the morbid affections, re&s;ulting from any &s;pecies of either of the three foregoing genera of poi&s;ons. I believe it to be a truth, that they have never been known to be, in any in&s;tance, communicable. The poi&s;on, therefor, giving birth to pe&s;tilential and infectious di&s;ea&s;es, be|longs to that genus, which derives its origin from the putrefactive proce&s;s.</P><P>Putrefaction I would con&s;ider as a <HI>generic</HI> term, embracing &s;everal <HI>&s;pecific</HI> or at lea&s;t <HI>various</HI> modes, in which organized bodies undergo di&s;&s;olution, and recombination into ga&s;eous re&s;ults, &s;ome of them of a delete|rious or poi&s;onous nature. The&s;e poi&s;onous re&s;ult would &s;eem to differ from each other, according to the varieties of the proce&s;s by which they were produced. Thus for example, from one particular de&s;cription or mo|dification of the putrefactive proce&s;s, or, if the reader be more plea&s;ed with the hypothe&s;is, from the putrefaction of a particular de&s;cription of matter, originated the poi&s;onous offluvia or &s;eeds of pe&s;tilence; from another, tho&s;e of &s;mall-pox, from another, tho&s;e of mea&s;les, from another, tho&s;e of lues venerea, &amp;c. From the foregoing principles it would appear, that all infectious di&s;ea&s;es, as the &s;mall-pox and lues venerea, in&s;tead of being, as they have been generally &s;uppo&s;ed, the &s;pecific and exclu&s;ive growth of the Ea&s;t, the We&s;t, or of any particular climate or &s;ituation, may, under cer|tain circum&s;tances, originate in any inhabited portion of our globe. Nor do I con&s;ider our own country as by any means exempt from this general charge. I believe, that the &s;mall pox may originate in America or Europe, as well as in A&s;ia, and that the venereal di&s;ea&s;e may originate in A&s;ia or Europe, as well as in America. I am per&s;uaded that the great and irre|ver&s;ible principles, by which, the decompo&s;ition and recompo&s;ition of matter are governed, operate uniformly in all places, and that no &s;pot on the globe is privileged with a &s;pecial exemption from their influence.</P><P>I am aware, that, by &s;ome phy&s;icians, this note will be con&s;idered as nothing el&s;e than the mere child of fancy, or as the airy effu&s;ion of a &s;pecu|lative mina&mdash;Be it &s;o&mdash;I will, however, mo&s;t &s;incerely thank &s;uch &s;olid and &s;agacious characters, to point out to me a more probable &s;ource of pe&s;|tilential and infectious di&s;ea&s;es, than the putrefactive di&s;&s;olution of organ|ized bodies!</P></NOTE></P>

greater expo&s;ure of men to actual hard&s;hip and fatigue, are the two only circum&s;tances, relative to health and di&s;ea&s;e, in which military &s;ituations differ materially from others.

Let me me not, on the pre|&s;ent occa&s;ion, fail to ob&s;erve, that when pe&s;tilence breaks out in any place, it never fails to make its appearance about that period, when, from the u&s;ual co-operation of phy&s;ical cau&s;es, the proce&s;s of general putrefaction, has arrived to its &s;ummit.&mdash;Thus may pe&s;tilential effluvia be generated in every &s;pot on the &s;urface of the globe, where the &s;oil gives birth to organized bodies, and the climate affords a &s;uffici|ency of heat and moi&s;ture, to give ri&s;e to a high putrefac|tive proce&s;s.

When any incon&s;iderable difference, then, is di&s;covered in the ge|neral appearances of the pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es, by which the two countries are occa&s;ionally invaded, it may doubtle&s;s be attributed to the &s;ame cau&s;es.</P>
<P>With regard to the pe&s;tilence of the We&s;t Indies, it might, at fir&s;t &s;ight, appear to be, in one re&s;pect, very ma|terially different from the other two. Thus, we learn from phy&s;icians, on who&s;e report we may, mo&s;t confidently, rely, that the former di&s;ea&s;e is never, in any in&s;tance, known to be contagious, whereas there is, perhaps, rea&s;on to believe, that the ca&s;e is different with re&s;pect to the two latter. That they are occa&s;ionally propagated by contagion, is a po&s;i|tion, to the truth of which phy&s;icians of the highe&s;t emi|nence have, at all times, afforded the te&s;timony of their a&s;|&s;ent. On farther reflection, however, it will be immedi|ately perceived, that this trait in the character of the We&s;t

India pe&s;tilence re&s;ults entirely from the influence of a tro|pical climate. For it is a fact, well known to phy&s;icians of experience and information, that a high and uniform temperature of atmo&s;phere, is decidedly ho&s;tile to the com|munication of pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es. Such a temperature, continued for &s;ome time, arre&s;ts the progre&s;s of even the de&s;olating pe&s;tilence of A&s;ia. It is a truth, which mu&s;t be alike familiar to you all, that, at Con&s;tantinople, the &s;um|mer no le&s;s than the winter &s;ol&s;tice be&s;tows on the inhabi|tants a temporary re&s;pite from the ravages of that dread|ful calamity.&mdash;As, then, the men of Europe, A&s;ia, Africa and America, are held, by our mo&s;t eminent philo&s;ophers, to belong to the &s;ame &s;pecies, and to owe the diver&s;ities in their appearance, principally, to the influence of climate and manner of life, would not a &s;imilar ob&s;ervation appear to be admi&s;&s;ible, with re&s;pect to the pe&s;tilential epidemics of tho&s;e four divi&s;ions of the globe? May not the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es be, very rationally, viewed as the &s;ame in their nature, va|riou&s;ly modified by climate, and by the habits and man|ners of the human race?</P>

It merits, therefore, the mo&s;t profound attention of every American, who is a friend to his country, or who wi&s;hes well to the intere&s;t of the human race.</P>
<P>The &s;ubject of the origin of our late and preceding epi|demics, has been already &s;o amply di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, that tho&s;e who take it up, at this period, can be con&s;idered as little el&s;e than gleaners in the field of controver&s;y.

To gain your a&s;&s;ent to their truth and ju&s;tice, con&s;titutes, at pre&s;ent, the height of my ambition.</P>
<P N="1">I. Con&s;iderably remote from the breezes of the ocean, and &s;tanding on a &s;cite of but a moderate elevation, Philadelphia is by no means favourably &s;ituated for free ventilation. The&s;e di&s;advantages, co-operating with tho&s;e of numerous, lofty, and crouded buildings, produce a &s;tagnation in the air of mo&s;t parts of the city, unknown in places exempt from &s;uch ob&s;tructions. This &s;tagnation is very &s;en&s;ibly, and even oppre&s;&s;ively, experienced, by our citizens, during the warmth of the &s;ummer months. It is unnece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that an atmo&s;phere, &s;uch as this, is in a fit &s;tate
<PB N="48" REF="035263_0045_1001B4E4F904B5D0">
for the reception and retention of noxious effluvia. Nor does it, under this evident want of motion, appear, by any means, well calculated to dilute or weaken &s;uch effluvia, and thus obviate their pernicious influence on the human &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P N="2">II. Philadelphia, though &s;ituated in the latitude of forty, is, notwith&s;tanding, annually &s;ubjected to all the fervors of a tropical climate, for the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;pace of, at lea&s;t, eighty or ninety days. Suffering, during this lengthy period, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;uperior, by three or four degrees, to that of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> country, it may be con&s;idered as a pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fect hot-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e, with regard to generating and fo&s;tering the &s;eeds o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ti|lential di&s;ea&s;e. Granting, therefore, that pe&s;tilence is the more native offspring of a tropical &s;ky, and that it is even incapable of &s;pringing &s;pontaneou&s;ly beneath the natural temperature of a milder climate, yet &s;till, may it ri&s;e and flouri&s;h luxuriantly in the hot-bed of a city as large and po|pulous as that of Philadelphia. Thus, the plants of the tropics are reared in hot-hou&s;es by the curious, beneath the highe&s;t and mo&s;t rigorous latitudes inhabited by man. In like manner may pe&s;tilence, (though po&s;&s;ibly the more na|tural product of a tropical climate,) be reared to perfection in the hot-bed of Philadelphia.</P>
<P N="3">III. The two evils, which I have ju&s;t &s;pecified, are, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, nece&s;&s;arily attendant on our unfortunate ci|ty. Though, by wi&s;dom and indu&s;try, they may be dimi|ni&s;hed, to remove them, entirely, is beyond the limited pow|ers of man. Their foundation is laid in the works of <HI>na|ture,</HI>
<PB N="49" REF="035263_0046_1001B4EB1D682ED8">
and <HI>art</HI> is, therefore, incompetent to their removal. Its utmo&s;t extent is to obviate the mi&s;chiefs which they tend to produce. We cannot countermand the exce&s;&s;ive heats of our climate, we are unable to elevate the ground on which Philadelphia &s;tands; nor can we invoke, with ef|fect, the breezes of the Atlantic, to &s;hed refre&s;hment through our oppre&s;&s;ive &s;treets!<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Notwith&s;tanding the above ob&s;ervations, I am per&s;uaded, that, by a due attention to dome&s;tic cleanline&s;s, co-operating with &s;uch port regula|tions, as will prevent ve&s;&s;els containing foul air from entering our har|bour, the city of Philadelphia may be rendered as perfectly exempt from pe&s;tilential epi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ics, as any commercial city in the the world.</NOTE></P>
<P>Another evil remains yet to be mentioned, very differ|ent, in its nature, from the preceding two. It is altogether of artificial birth, and art and indu&s;try are, therefore, com|petent to its extinction. I allude to the immen&s;ity of filth, with which the different parts of our city and &s;uburbs a|bound. Nor is this an evil of inferior magnitude. It may be con&s;idered as the hydra, who&s;e malignant breath, gave birth to the calamities we have three times &s;uffered. The &s;everities of the &s;ea&s;on have parali&s;ed it, for the pre&s;ent, and reduced it to its cu&s;tomary &s;tate of hybernation. But unle&s;s prevented, by an adoption of the mo&s;t wi&s;e and ener|getic mea&s;ures, there is but too much rea&s;on to apprehend, that it will be again awakened to life and action, by the re|turning warmth of the &s;ummer &s;un!

<P>In taking a &s;urvey of many parts of our city and &s;uburbs, our &s;en&s;es are &s;truck by the offen&s;ive and dangerous &s;pec|tacle, of an accumulation of the filth of nearly a cen|tury. In pa&s;&s;ing, in &s;everal directions, to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the pavements of our &s;treets, we are not even &s;uffered to tread on the &s;oil of nature. We travel over artificial ground, made up of a fermenting a&s;&s;emblage of the mo&s;t noxious materials.

of this enormous evil, nor erecting any barriers to check its growth. Even the melancholy rever&s;e of this is true. Notwith&s;tanding the numerous declarations we hear, in favour of the cleanline&s;s of our &s;treets, at pre&s;ent, compared to what exi&s;ted &s;ome years ago, it is an unque&s;tionable truth, that, in the exi&s;ting &s;tate of things, as year &s;ucceeds to year, the aggregate ma&s;s of filth in our city and &s;uburbs encrea&s;es.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The filth taken up from our &s;treets, not excepting even that which is removed from our nece&s;&s;aries them&s;elves, is, at pre&s;ent, conveyed to &s;uch an incon&s;iderable di&s;tance from the city, that it might almo&s;t as well, be &s;uffered to remain in its original &s;ituation. In&s;tead of employing &s;uch ma|terials for filling up ponds, and levelling the ground, in the &s;outh-we&s;tern part of the city, would it not be much more wi&s;e and economical, to con|vert them to the purpo&s;e of fertilizing the ground, under cultivation in the neighbourhood, where, in&s;tead of proving de&s;tructive to the life of man, the effluvia which they emit, might contribute, to rear up vegeta|bles for his &s;u&s;tenance and comfort?</NOTE> Should our civic police, (as far as it re&s;pects the prevention of di&s;ea&s;e,) continue &s;upine and feeble, as it is, at pre&s;ent, what a dark and gloomy pro&s;pect is opened to our view! With the future progre&s;s of time, danger would &s;eem to accumulate on danger, and di&s;tre&s;s to blacken over di&s;tre&s;s, till imagination becomes bewildered, in attempting to cal|culate the melancholy re&s;ult.</P>
<P>Owing to &s;uch a &s;tate of dome&s;tic filth, as now prevails in and around the city of Philadelphia, was the plague, in former times, the &s;courge of London, and other populous ci|ties of Europe; and, owing to a &s;imilar &s;tate, does it &s;till

continue, occa&s;ionally, to rage in Con&s;tantinople, and in ma+ny other devoted places in the Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>However painful the pro&s;pect, and however unpopular the idea, may, at pre&s;ent, be with many, it is, in my ap|prehen&s;ion of things, a truth which ought not to be forgot|ten, that unle&s;s the misfortune be averted, by the mo&s;t vi|gilant and energetic mea&s;ures of dome&s;tic cleanline&s;s, the the large commercial cities of America will, in, perhaps, le&s;s than a century, become as remarkable for giving birth to pe&s;tilence, as any ever have been in Europe, or as any are now on the continent of A&s;ia.</P>
<P>To enumerate all the &s;ources of our dome&s;tic filth, is not my pre&s;ent object. This has already been ably done, in &s;everal memorials from the Academy of medicine. There exi&s;t, however, two &s;ources in particular, to which, I will be pardoned for thinking, that the public attention has not been directed, in a manner &s;ufficiently forcible. The&s;e are, the va&s;t quantity of putrid and putrefying timber, which en|ters into the formation of our docks and wharves, and the immen&s;ity of animal and vegetable &s;ub&s;tances, &s;trewn, in a putrefactive &s;tate, along the commons, in a &s;outh-we&s;tern direction from the city.</P>
<P>From the former of the&s;e &s;ources, an incalculable volume of deleterious air mu&s;t be di&s;charged, to the great annoy|ance of the crews of ve&s;&s;els in our harbour, and of all who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s demands their attendance along &s;hore. For this evil the remedy is ea&s;y and obvious. The timbers ought to
<PB N="53" REF="035263_0050_1001AF4E705A47D8">
be removed, as much as po&s;&s;ible, from the docks and wharves, and their place &s;upplied by brick or &s;tone.</P>
<P>From the latter &s;ource, namely, the abundance of putri|fying &s;ub&s;tances, di&s;per&s;ed over the commons, in a <HI>south wes|tern</HI> direction, the air of the city mo&s;t be deeply contami|nated. To have a due &s;en&s;e of the propriety and weight of this ob&s;ervation, it is nece&s;&s;ary to recollect, that, parti|cularly, during the months of July, Augu&s;t, and September, our prevailing winds are from that quarter. Whatever noxious effluvia, therefore, may be evolved from tho&s;e &s;ub|&s;tances, by the proce&s;s of putrefaction, is wafted, immedi|ately, into the heart of our city, and mingled with the air of the &s;treets which we breathe. There is certainly rea&s;on to believe, that, to the&s;e effluvia, we were indebted, in no incon&s;iderable degree, for that local con&s;titution of atmo&s;|phere, &s;o highly favourable to the propagation of our late epidemic.</P>
<P>It is &s;carcely nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that the remedy for this evil is the immediate and entire removal of the offen|&s;ive &s;ub&s;tances. If the places, which tho&s;e matters now occupy, were planted with trees or &s;hrubbery, or, even, put under a crop of inferior vegetation, the effect, on the city, would be both plea&s;ant and &s;alutary. Vegetables are known to emit, during their wakeful and active &s;tate, large quantities of pure re&s;pirable air. Were the above regu|lation, therefore, adopted, in&s;tead of the offen&s;ive and per|nicious vapour of putrefaction, this fluid of life, would,
<PB N="54" REF="035263_0051_1001AF40A2C6CD30">
in con&s;equence of the &s;outh-we&s;tern winds of &s;ummer and autumn, glide through our &s;treets, and diffu&s;e both health and vigour from its wings.</P>
<P>To the two preceding &s;ources of the vitiation of our at|mo&s;phere, let me not omit to &s;ubjoin that which is con&s;ti|tuted by our public burying grounds. To a mind eying, with deep &s;olicitude, the apparently dubious balance of fate, with re&s;pect to the future pro&s;perity of our city, the&s;e ex|ten&s;ive re&s;ervoirs, fraught with the mouldering relicts of the dead, pre&s;ent them&s;elves, as objects of painful apprehen|&s;ion. They appear equally <HI>melancholy</HI> and <HI>dangerous,</HI> and, in neither re&s;pect, is the degree incon&s;iderable. Situated, as &s;ome of them are, in the very centre of our city, the&s;e &s;pacious inclo&s;ures, a great part of the &s;oil of which, is com|po&s;ed of human exuviae, cannot do otherwi&s;e than aid in contaminating the air of our &s;treets, and the water of our pumps. That the water of our city is injured, by the immen&s;ity of dead bodies, depo&s;ited in our grave-yards, we would infer, from the very con&s;iderable di&s;tance, to which the putrid effluvia, from the contents of a grave, have been known to make their way, through the bowels of the earth. And, that the &s;ame cau&s;e, has a tendency to vitiate our at|mo&s;phere, we would conclude, in particular, from certain phy&s;ical phenomena, for which ancient grave-yards have been always remarkable. The phenonema, to which I al|lude are, a kind of burning meteors, that &s;weep along the &s;urface of the ground, and which are known, under the vulgar denomination of Will-with-the-wi&s;p, or Jack-with-the-lanthern.
<PB N="55" REF="035263_0052_1001B512FB99F328">
The&s;e would &s;eem to owe their exi&s;tence, principally, to an inflammable gas, di&s;charged, through the pores of the earth, from the putrefying contents of the graves, and have, probably, aided much, in giving origin to the &s;uper&s;titious legends of the ignorant, re&s;pecting church|yards being haunted, by goblins and gho&s;ts.</P>
<P>For this evil, I need hardly ob&s;erve, that the only reme|dy is, the removal of our burying grounds, to a di&s;tance from the city. Nor let an attachment and veneration, however natural and amiable, for the relicts of our friends, prevent the adoption of &s;uch a &s;alutary mea&s;ure! If we painfully feel and deplore the lo&s;s of our <HI>friends deceased,</HI> why di&s;po&s;e of their bodies, in &s;uch a way, as to &s;ow the &s;eeds of pe&s;tilence and death, among tho&s;e that &s;urvive, and thus, voluntarily, &s;ubject our&s;elves to additional &s;orrow? To a feeling and reflecting mind, it is, doubtle&s;s, a much more eligible alternative, to have a portion of our relatives and friends &s;till living, and tho&s;e that are dead, buried in a di&s;tant &s;ituation, and, even, in what &s;ome might con&s;ider as unhallowed ground, than to have them all &s;wept off, though buried in the immediate vicinity of our dwellings, and in ground duly con&s;ecrated for the purpo&s;e of interment.</P>

As well may we a&s;&s;ert, that the &s;ame &s;un, which promotes vegetation, in the ea&s;tern, has no &s;uch influence in the we&s;tern hemi&s;phere, as deny to cau&s;es, which are known and acknowledged to give birth to pe&s;tilence, in the cities of A&s;ia, the power of producing the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e, when operating, with equal force, in the cities of America. Could I be per&s;uaded, that, under &s;imilar circum&s;tances, the &s;ame cau&s;es, do not, uniformly and nece&s;&s;arily, produce the &s;ame effects in A&s;ia and America, I would, immediately, &s;ub&s;cribe to the Pagan belief of Polythei&s;m. In &s;uch a &s;tate of things, I would be con&s;trained to believe, that the God of the old world, was not, in like manner, the God of the new, but that the two hemi&s;pheres of our globe, were governed by di&s;tinct Deities, through the medium of differ|ent phy&s;ical laws!</P>

The force of this evidence, however, will be much dimini&s;hed, when we recollect, that almo&s;t the only medical charac|ters, in Great Britain, who oppo&s;ed the truth of Harvey's di&s;covery of the circulation of the blood, and blindly adhered to the antiquated and ab|&s;urd error of its flux and reflux through the &s;ame channels, were &s;uch as bad, at the time of the di&s;covery, pa&s;&s;ed the fortieth year of their age.
