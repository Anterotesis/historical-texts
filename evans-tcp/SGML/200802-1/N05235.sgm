<HEAD>Some OBSERVATIONS relating to the Circum&s;tances of the Province.</HEAD>
<P>IF an Inhabitant of this Province, who is much intere&s;ted in its Happine&s;s, will but ca&s;t his Eye back on the three or four pa&s;t Years, and view his Country &s;inking under an in&s;upportable Burden of Taxes and a Decay of Trade, his Mind mu&s;t feel a very &s;en&s;ible Shock: and even any one who is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of but the common Principles of Humanity, and so ways intere&s;ted in the Fate of this Province, would be excited to a generous Pity for its unhappy Circum&s;tances, when he view'd it in &s;uch a Situation.</P>
<P>IT is &s;ome Alleviation however of &s;uch a Misfortune, that it proceeded from heavy Charges, con&s;equent on a long expen&s;ive War, carried on by Subjects, who have di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by Loyalty to the be&s;t of Kings, and by a firm Attachment to the Liberty and Priviledges of the happie&s;t of Governments.</P>
<P>WHILE the Neighbouring Provinces have, as it were, lain ba&s;king in the Sun&s;hine of Peace and Security, &s;miling in their Ea&s;e and defended from the Incur&s;ion of an Indian Enemy, by us as their Barriers; we on the contrary have been obliged, for the common Safety, to garri&s;on our Frontiers and to be at the Expence of our Blood and Trea&s;ure, to &s;ecure our&s;elves from the De&s;truc|tion which even a &s;mall Number of the Indian Enemy could always &s;pread around us; when at the &s;ame time &s;ome of the&s;e Provinces have happily felt, in a propor|tionable Degree, the good Effects of the exerting of our Strength during the Cour&s;e of this War.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="006612_0004_102951E7C896E210">BY our Zeal and Loyalty (carried almo&s;t to a Pitch of Enthu&s;ia&s;m) we have not only prevented the breaking up of the Settlements of &s;ome of the more neighbouring Provinces, but we have al&s;o &s;aved that very important Fortre&s;s of <HI>Annapolis,</HI> when on the very Brink of being &s;urrendered to the <HI>French,</HI> who always prove the wor&s;t of Neighbours; in Peace eternally encroaching upon the Rights of Mankind, and in War not always behaving in the mo&s;t generous Manner: And even at this Time, notwith&s;tanding the mo&s;t &s;olemn Treaties, in&s;tigating the <HI>Indian</HI> Enemy to &s;pread Murders and De&s;olation among the new Settlements in <HI>Nova-Scotia,</HI> when (notwith&s;tand|ing their national Perfidy) they dare not appear as imme|diate Actors in this Scene of Villainy. Nay &s;uch an Abhorrence have even &s;ome of the Prie&s;ts of their own Nation, at their late horrid Act of &s;ending Mi&s;&s;ionaries among &s;ome of the <HI>Ea&s;tern Indian</HI> Tribes, in order to in&s;tigate them to this Cruelty, that one of them was humane enough to &s;ay, that he would not be concerned in &s;uch a Mi&s;&s;ion for all the Riches in <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>IN the beginning of the <HI>Spani&s;h War</HI> our Expence was very great, in rai&s;ing Levies for what is called the <HI>Cuba</HI> Expedition; and notwith&s;tanding the Di&s;tance of that I&s;land from this Province, and the little Pro&s;pect that the Succe&s;s of that Expedition would immediately affect us, yet from a Principle of Loyalty, <HI>five hundred</HI> Men from this Government were embarked upon it, at no incon|&s;iderable Charge, of which not above <HI>fifty</HI> returned.</P>
<P>BUT the mo&s;t chargeable Expedition was that to <HI>Cape-Breton,</HI> in which we expended almo&s;t <HI>two Millions</HI> old Tenor, a Sum va&s;tly exceeding our Ability, and which nothing but the la&s;t Extremity could excu&s;e us the ex|pending of; an Extremity which not only very nearly affected us, but al&s;o the whole Continent be&s;ides, and in which the Trade of the Engli&s;h Nation both with Regard to that great Branch of it the Cod-Fi&s;hery, as al&s;o its Navigation to the Northern Colonies was deeply
<PB N="5" REF="006612_0005_102951EAB335E4D0">
intere&s;ted. In this Expedition we almo&s;t made our&s;elves Bankrupts, not only with Re&s;pect to Money, but al&s;o with Regard to Labour, the wor&s;t Bankruptcy that a Com|munity can &s;uffer; for we expended &s;ome thou&s;ands of Lives, which were lo&s;t by a Mortality con&s;equent on the &s;urrender of <HI>Loui&s;bourg,</HI> who were &s;ome of the Flower of the People; and who&s;e Lo&s;s to a Country that wants Inhabitants, can be repaired neither in a &s;hort Time nor without great Charge and Difficulty.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Expedition in which we were at great Ex|pence, was that de&s;igned for <HI>Canada,</HI> and recommended from the <HI>Crown</HI>; and although the Scheme was not executed, yet Bounty Money and Billetting <HI>two thou&s;and</HI> Men, could be very ill &s;pared by a People, who were already &s;o much drained of both Men and Money.</P>
<P>THIS was the late unhappy Situation of this di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Province; whil&s;t its remaining Inhabitants were groaning under a Burden of Taxes, which had almo&s;t &s;unk them into Ruin; and which they would not have been able to have &s;upported, had not the Parliament of <HI>Great-Bri|tain,</HI> (as a Reward of our Loyalty and Services) di&s;charged our Provincial Debt, by a Grant enabling us to &s;ink our Paper Currency.</P>
<P>THIS Slavery we are redeemed from, almo&s;t in&s;tanta|neou&s;ly, in&s;tead of lingring out a few unhappy Years: And to this agreeable Pro&s;pect I now chearfully turn my Eyes, and &s;incerely congratulate my fellow Subjects of this Province on &s;o &s;udden a Tran&s;ition from a State of Perplexity to a Scene opening to &s;ocial Happine&s;s, if we are not wanting to our&s;elves; which &s;urely we cannot be, after &s;o happy a Deliverance.</P>
<P>THE Wi&s;dom of our Legi&s;lature in providing a &s;alutary Method to make the Parliamentary Grant as beneficial as po&s;&s;ible, by pa&s;&s;ing a Law to call in our bad Paper Cur|rency, is a Conduct highly to be applauded: And the
<PB N="6" REF="006612_0006_102951EC469CC3A8">
Firmne&s;s and Re&s;olution which the <HI>General A&s;&s;embly</HI> in their la&s;t Se&s;&s;ions, &s;hewed, in confirming that Law (not|with&s;tanding the Quibbling and Chicanery of &s;ome de|&s;igning Men to invalidate it, in order to demand Silver according to the Face of tho&s;e Province Bills which they were Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of) is what expre&s;&s;es the highe&s;t Regard to the good of the Society, and what is like to have a mo&s;t happy Influence on our Political and Commercial Affairs, if as &s;teadily pur&s;ued.</P>
<P>IT was &s;urprizing to &s;ee the little Arts, and to hear the Sophi&s;try of &s;ome de&s;igning Mock Patriots, to evade the Force of this Law; but it was more affecting to &s;ee hone&s;t well meaning Per&s;ons deluded by them. The &s;tanding Argument was Oppre&s;&s;ion; that the Province could never bear &s;o &s;udden a Change of its Medium, and that the Silver would be immediately &s;hipped off; by which Means there would be no Currency to &s;upport the Trade of the Province. This looked plau&s;ible and popular, but the Veil was too thin to conceal the Artifice from the lea&s;t penetrating Eye; for the propo&s;ed Effect from this Argument was, that Individuals who had for &s;ome little Time pa&s;t cloi&s;tered the Paper Bills, rendering them u&s;e|le&s;s to the Community, &s;hould have that Quantity of Silver for tho&s;e Bills which they were worth at the Emi&s;|&s;ion of them. Unhappily, a great Number of Well-wi&s;hers to their Country &s;truck in with this Scheme and rai&s;ed a popular Clamour; which had they &s;een through, I dare affirm they never would have done; for the ine|vitable Con&s;equence of it would have been, the rai&s;ing <HI>eight or nine hundred thou&s;and Pounds Tax</HI> Old Tenor upon the Inhabitants of this Province; which had it been rai&s;ed, I believe the Projectors of it would almo&s;t have been cur&s;ed for. This Tax we are now di&s;burthened of, by the Firmne&s;s of &s;ome, who &s;incerely wi&s;hed their Country's Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>SUFFERERS there are and will be without the lea&s;t Doubt; and this occa&s;ions &s;ome &s;evere, unju&s;t, and give
<PB N="7" REF="006612_0007_102951F1A659A080">
me leave to &s;ay, libellous Cen&s;ures on the Government: but &s;uch Per&s;ons ought to remember, that in a Commu|nity where Affairs are &s;o unhappily complicated as they have been in ours, the general Good of that, as well as of every other Society, ought to be the fir&s;t Principle of Action in each of its Individuals: and to promote the Ruin of <HI>Nine Tenths</HI> of a Community to enrich the other <HI>Tenth,</HI> is the wor&s;t Here&s;y in Politicks, and which no wi&s;e Go|vernment would ever be guilty of. Such Per&s;ons ought farther to con&s;ider, that it has not the lea&s;t Affinity to Ju&s;tice, to &s;uffer a Number of Per&s;ons who have been &s;o lucky, as within a few Months to have filled their Che&s;ts with Province Bills, when in &s;o &s;hort a Time their Value is not altered one Farthing; I &s;ay, it would be even In|ju&s;tice to &s;uffer &s;uch Per&s;ons to make a Prey of the re&s;t of the Community, by demanding two Ounces of Silver for but one Ounce Value in other Commodities, which they have &s;o lately exchanged for tho&s;e Bills.</P>
<P>AS I &s;aid before, real Sufferers there will be; but had this Affair been conducted agreeable to the avaritious Views of &s;ome; where there is <HI>one</HI> Sufferer now, there would then have been at lea&s;t <HI>twenty.</HI> I take that Maxim to be founded on eternal Truth, viz. <HI>Salus Populi e&s;t &s;uprema Lex,</HI> i. e, the Safety of the People is the ultimate End of Society. But I forbear enlarging here, as all the Exceptions that have been made to this Act, have been fully and &s;en&s;ibly an&s;wered, in a Pamphlet publi&s;hed la&s;t Year, entitled, <HI>A brief Account of the Ri&s;e, Progre&s;s and pre&s;ent State of the Paper Currency of New England.</HI></P>
<P>SINCE Things are brought to this Cri&s;is, it certainly mu&s;t be the Duty of every Member of Society to pro|mote its Welfare to the utmo&s;t of its Power, and to make its Peace and Plenty flow in an <HI>even, &s;teady</HI> Channel; which it is certainly in our Power to do, and we &s;hall have none to blame but our &s;elves, if our Affairs &s;hould be diverted into a <HI>wrong</HI> one.</P>
<P>PARTICULARLY are our Eyes turned to the <HI>General
<PB N="8" REF="006612_0008_102951F4D472E8B8">
A&s;&s;embly</HI> in their pre&s;ent Se&s;&s;ion; and it is to You the <HI>Fathers of our Country,</HI> that we addre&s;s our &s;elves, for it is on you more immediately that we depend for future Happine&s;s. It is in your Power, by the Steadine&s;s and Prudence of your Conduct in making &s;alutary <HI>Laws,</HI> and in giving proper Encouragement to our <HI>Trade</HI> and to the Produce of our <HI>Soil,</HI> to lay the Foundation of our Wel|fare &s;o deep, that the Envy of our Neighbours &s;hall not be able to undermine it. Peace we are now ble&s;&s;ed with, and if we do not make Plenty the Attendant on it, let us never murmur at Providence for what future Misfor|tunes may befall us; &s;ince our pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances are &s;uch, that we have it very much in our Power to prevent them. The Conduct of Providence with Regard to our political Affairs has been too &s;ingular to be pa&s;s'd by un|ob&s;erved; and it &s;eems, that whatever Inconveniencies we have &s;uffered by engaging in that very chargeable Expedition again&s;t <HI>Cape Breton,</HI> they are more than fully recompenced by the De&s;truction of a depreciating Paper Medium: and had it not been for that Expedition, per|haps we &s;hould not have &s;o convincingly felt the wretched Detail of Vice and Mi&s;ery, which always follows large Emi&s;&s;ions of it: There has one Inconvenience always gone Hand in Hand with tho&s;e large Emi&s;&s;ions, which I believe is very little con&s;idered; and that is, the Minds of many &s;eem to be &s;o much debauched by it, that the Notions of Right and Wrong are quite indi&s;tinct and are excluded from other Parts of their Conduct in Life: And whatever affects the Morals of a Community ought &s;urely to be regarded, in Proportion to the Degree in which they are &s;o affected.</P>
<P>BUT be&s;ides the alteration of our Currency, many other things &s;eem to require the clo&s;e&s;t Attention and mo&s;t vi|gorous Pro&s;ecution, in order to introduce and e&s;tabli&s;h the publick Happine&s;s and Pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>In the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Place, as Nature has calculated our Situa|tion for a beneficial <HI>Trade,</HI> &s;uch Trade ought to be nur&s;ed in the mo&s;t tender Manner; for unle&s;s we can by good

Economy export larger Quantities of Commodities than we import, we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be reduced to Poverty. We are now free from our Provincial Debt, and it is generally imagined by tho&s;e who have examined mo&s;t critically the Commerce of the Province, that upon &s;et|tling the whole Account, the Ballance is in our Favour: But taking it for granted that we were <HI>one hundred thou&s;and Pounds</HI> Sterling in Debt, yet it would be no great Misfortune; for we have at this Time <HI>two Mil|lions</HI> Old Tenor in Silver in the Province; and &s;uppo|&s;ing we &s;hould immediately di&s;charge that <HI>one hundred thou&s;and Pound</HI> with Part of it, yet we &s;hould have <HI>eight hundred thou&s;and Pound</HI> Old Tenor remaining for a Me|dium among&s;t us, at the lowe&s;t Computation; which Sum is allowed by tho&s;e who are well acquainted with the Cour&s;e of our Trade, to be fully &s;ufficient to an&s;wer all the Purpo&s;es of a Medium for it. And I think this ought to remove all Fears of the Silver's being exiled the Province; for be&s;ides the above State of the Ca&s;e, there are con&s;iderable Quantities of Silver and Gold imported from the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> and other Places; &s;o that if we at la&s;t loo&s;e that which is generally agreed upon by Man|kind for a Medium of Trade and ought to be the only one with us, it will certainly be our own Faults; and the only Way which it can be lo&s;t in, is by our own <HI>Luxury</HI> and <HI>Extravagance,</HI> which if we do not retrench, and give up that Part of our Trade which indulges them, it will be in vain to attempt the retaining Silver with us; And if we had ten thou&s;and Times as much as we now have, yet &s;uch ill Conduct would infallibly make it u&s;ele&s;s to us, and tho&s;e who &s;upplied this Luxury and Extravagance of ours would reap the Benefit of our Lo&s;s of the Silver in Exchange for their gratifying our Vice and Folly. The Ca&s;e is ea&s;ily reduced to Demon&s;tration: only &s;ub&s;titute a private Per&s;on in the Room of the Province, and let that Per&s;on be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of <HI>ten thou&s;and Pound</HI> clear from all Debt, yet if that Per&s;on will expend annually the In|tere&s;t of his <HI>ten thou&s;and Pound</HI> and <HI>one thou&s;and Pound</HI> per Year of the Principle be&s;ides, (having no other Means of

Support) he mu&s;t certainly in the Cour&s;e of a Few Years, prove a Bankrupt: On the contrary, &s;uppo&s;ing this &s;ame Per&s;on &s;hould expend the Intere&s;t of only <HI>nine thou&s;and Pound</HI> of this Money Annually, he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily add to his E&s;tate and grow rich in a Cour&s;e of Years. The&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed Facts are too plain to be denied by the mo&s;t ig|norant Examiner, and this is the State of every Society. An <HI>Advantageous Trade</HI> ought therefore in every Manner to be encouraged, and a <HI>di&s;advantageous one</HI> by all Ways to be di&s;couraged; what Laws may burden the former &s;hould be repealed, and any Sumptuary ones that may clog the latter be enacted. For if the Ballance upon the whole of the Trade of any Country is in its Favour, that Country mu&s;t grow <HI>rich,</HI> &s;ince the Ballance in its Favour, whatever it be, mu&s;t be paid in Money; on the contrary, when the Ballance of the whole Trade is again&s;t a Country, that Country, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily grow <HI>Poor,</HI> as long as &s;uch Trade is carried on, till at la&s;t it becomes quite <HI>Bankrupt,</HI> at lea&s;t as to the Means of carrying Trade on, viz. <HI>its Money.</HI> Nor will any Medium the Government can find at all help the Matter, this we all know has been the po|pular Argument among&s;t us for a long Time pa&s;t, but it is as <HI>ab&s;urd</HI> and <HI>prepo&s;terous</HI> as it is <HI>popular.</HI> It is a certain and undoubted Maxim, that Trade ought to find its own Medium; and for this plain Rea&s;on, becau&s;e if it be a profitable Trade, the Profit ari&s;ing from it, that is the Ballance will be paid in <HI>Money,</HI> and of Con&s;equence it will &s;upport it &s;elf without the Help of any Government Me|dium; and if it be a lo&s;ing Trade, which is the only one that can &s;tand in need of any Artificial Medium, it ought not to be encouraged, nay, not only &s;o, but any &s;uch Me|dium will bani&s;h the intrin&s;ick good Medium entirely away, and convert a profitable Trade into the direct con|trary.</P>
<P>THIS one would have thought our own pa&s;t Experience would have convinced every Man of. For what End, with Regard to Trade, hath the enormous Quantities of Paper Bills, that have been i&s;&s;ued out, &s;erved but the in|crea&s;ing

our luxurious and extravagant Con&s;umption of foreign Commodities, the lo&s;s of all our Money, the De|&s;truction in a great mea&s;ure of publick and private Faith, the debauching our Morals, the Encouragement of Idle|ne&s;s, and Introduction of Poverty: And this mu&s;t eternally be the Ca&s;e, &s;ince, as there can be no Occa&s;ion for the Go|vernment's finding a Medium, but in &s;upport of a lo&s;ing Trade, the Con&s;equence mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be, that the Mo|ney will &s;oon be gone, and as foreign Debts increa&s;e, (for increa&s;e they mu&s;t as long as this Trade is carried on) there mu&s;t be a greater Demand for tho&s;e Things, that will an|&s;wer in Payment, and the greater that Demand is, the dear|er tho&s;e Things will be with Regard to this Government-Medium, or in other Words, this Medium mu&s;t depreciate, this naturally introduces <HI>Cheating</HI> and <HI>Oppre&s;&s;ion,</HI> and brings on <HI>Luxury</HI> and <HI>Extravagance,</HI> which produces <HI>Idle|ne&s;s,</HI> and at la&s;t ends in the <HI>extreame&s;t Poverty.</HI> Hath not this been the Ca&s;e with us! Did not the Emi&s;&s;ion of Paper Money &s;oon bani&s;h Gold and Silver from among&s;t us? Did not our foreign Debts continually increa&s;e till we had lo&s;t our <HI>Credit abroad</HI>? Did not the Demand for Returns to pay the&s;e Debts depreciate our Paper Me|dium till it was reduced to le&s;s than a &s;ixth Part of its original Value? Hath not this introduced all Kinds of Cheating and Oppre&s;&s;ion, without Regard I had almo&s;t &s;aid either to <HI>publick</HI> or <HI>private</HI> Faith? Have not many Per&s;ons ama&s;&s;ed E&s;tates, by running fir&s;t of all into, and then continuing in Debt, till they have at la&s;t by the De|preciation of the Currency paid their Creditors with three quarters or one half the Value of the Original Debt? Hath not this been the great Occa&s;ion of our re|markable and daily increa&s;ing Luxury? Hath not this been a great Di&s;couragement to Indu&s;try, without which no Community can flouri&s;h, and a great En|couragement of Idlene&s;s, the Bane and De&s;truction of every Society? Have not many Per&s;ons left off their more indu&s;trious, laborious Employments in which they have been brought up, when they &s;aw they could get a better Living in &s;o much ea&s;ier a Manner? And have

we not been reduced to &s;uch a Degree of Poverty, that we &s;hould have been in the greate&s;t Perplexity, had not the Parliament reimbur&s;ed us the Charge of the <HI>Loui&s;bourg</HI> Expedition, and our own Legi&s;lature, in &s;o wi&s;e a manner, provided for the Redemption of our Bills of Credit?</P>
<P>UPON the whole, we may &s;afely conclude, that any <HI>artificial local Medium</HI> for the Support of Trade, in&s;tead of an&s;wering the good Ends pretended to be de&s;igned by it, will entirely de&s;troy it, by driving away all Trade that is beneficial, and can &s;upport none but &s;uch as a Country had better be without; &s;uch an one, as the lon|ger it is &s;upported, will bring us into more Debt, and involve us in greater Mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>IT is then of the utmo&s;t Importance to give a due At|tention to the <HI>Trade and Commerce</HI> of a Country, upon which the <HI>Riches or Poverty</HI> of it depends, and of the la&s;t Nece&s;&s;ity, to give a proper Encouragement to the rai&s;ing and manufacturing tho&s;e Things that it is capable of, both for its own Con&s;umption, and for Exportation in return for what is nece&s;&s;arily obliged to take from others; and that there &s;hould be a &s;ufficient Di&s;couragement to the Con&s;umption of all <HI>foreign unnece&s;&s;ary Commodities,</HI> that &s;erve only for the feeding <HI>Luxury</HI> and gratifying <HI>Ex|travagance.</HI></P>
<P>ANOTHER Article of very great Importance, is the ea|&s;ing the Inhabitants of the Province, as much as po&s;&s;ible, of future <HI>Taxes.</HI> In ca&s;e of another War, there will in|fallibly ari&s;e new and great Charges to the Government; and con&s;equently Individuals mu&s;t pay a larger Tax to the Defence and Support of it, than they are obliged to in a Time of Peace: But during a Peace, the Scheme to pay the current Charges of the Government is &s;o ea&s;y, practicable and obvious, that it would be &s;urprizing if it was overlooked, According to &s;ome late Calculations, we con&s;ume annually nigh <HI>one million eight hundred thou&s;|and Pounds</HI> Old Tenor in &s;pirituous Liquors: &s;o large a Sum &s;eems almo&s;t incredible; but if the Time that is
<PB N="13" REF="006612_0013_10295205B8A13910">
mi&s;pent in the Con&s;umption of tho&s;e Liquors is taken into the Calculation, I make no Doubt it is too low; but giv|ing up that large Sum, let us only take it for granted that a <HI>Million</HI> Old Tenor is annually con&s;umed; yet the Expence even of that Sum (which I believe is va&s;tly within the Bounds of Truth) is a Piece of Luxury that ought to be retrenched; and if it can't be retrenched, the Con&s;umers have not the lea&s;t Rea&s;on to complain of an Exci&s;e upon it; and any Per&s;on of the lea&s;t Mode&s;ty who contributed to this Luxury, would be a&s;hamed to appear publickly again&s;t &s;uch a Propo&s;al; &s;ince the large Con|&s;umption of tho&s;e Liquors tends to ruin our Con&s;titutions; which is a Misfortune that not only will attend us, but reaches to our Po&s;terity; and at the &s;ame Time produces an Habit of Idlene&s;s, which has already impoveri&s;hed many Families, and is compleating the Ruin of many more. To &s;ee &s;uch a Province as this, ble&s;&s;ed with &s;o healthy a Climate; &s;uch a Variety of Soils calculated for the Pro|duce of almo&s;t all the Nece&s;&s;aries and Conveniences of Life; inhabited by a People &s;ituated under the happie&s;t of Governments; as brave in their natural Temper as any People on Earth; I &s;ay, to &s;ee a Province under all the&s;e and many other natural Advantages con&s;uming their Health and E&s;tate in Luxury and Extravagance, mu&s;t needs di&s;tingui&s;h us to the re&s;t of Mankind as guilty of the greate&s;t Mi&s;conduct, not to apply the Remedy which courts us: But if Individuals are loth to break off their bad Habits, it is &s;trictly incumbent on the Legi&s;la|ture to make &s;ome Good ari&s;e out of &s;o much Evil.</P>
<P>THE Exci&s;e upon Rum and other &s;pirituous Liquors is now <HI>two Shillings</HI> Old Tenor per Gallon, and the annual Produce of this and the other Exci&s;es is <HI>twenty-three thou&s;and Pound</HI> Old Tenor.&mdash;It is &s;uppo&s;ed that not one half of it is accounted for; now &s;uppo&s;ing the Exci&s;e &s;hould be rai&s;ed to <HI>four Shillings</HI> Old Tenor per Gallon, and to be paid at the Still Head; the neat Produce of this with the Duties of Import (which ought al&s;o to be rai&s;ed on what is con&s;umed within the Province) would
<PB N="14" REF="006612_0014_1029520749541F60">
be &s;ufficient to pay all the Charges of the Government. And in this Manner to be ea&s;ed of all our publick Taxes, &s;eems &s;o prudent and nece&s;&s;ary a Scheme, that a tender Regard for the good of the Province, ab&s;olutely requires it to be thought of at lea&s;t.</P>
<P>NOW I am on this Article of <HI>Taxes,</HI> I would ju&s;t ob|&s;erve that it &s;eems quite rea&s;onable that a &s;mall Tax &s;hould be layed on <HI>Wa&s;te Lands.</HI> The Inhabitants of the Pro|vince are taxed for their Faculties, and why a Tract of unimproved Land, that is ri&s;ing perhaps <HI>twenty</HI> per Cent per Annum &s;hould not be con&s;idered in &s;ome &s;uch Light, is difficult to di&s;tingui&s;h.</P>
<P>WE have been &s;o long burdened with Taxes, that it would reconcile the Minds of many of us to a Silver Medium, and detach us from our Fondne&s;s of a Paper Currency, if we could now have the Satisfaction, that we were for the future to be ea&s;ed of our old dreaded Bur|thens. This may be done, and the Que&s;tion is whether it ought not to be done?</P>
<P>OTHER <HI>Sumptuary Laws</HI> be&s;ides the <HI>Exci&s;e,</HI> may be nece&s;&s;ary, that would not interfere with the Intere&s;t of our Mother Country; particularly with Re&s;pect to the Extra|vagance of Dre&s;s. The <HI>Lex Oppia</HI> among the <HI>Romans,</HI> which was made in the 540th Year of the City, ordained, <HI>that no Woman &s;hould have above half an Ounce of Gold, wear a party coloured Garment, or be carried in a Chariot in any City, Town or to any Place within a Miles Di&s;tance, unle&s;s upon the Account of celebrating &s;ome &s;acred Solemnity.</HI> I ju&s;t mention this to &s;hew the Care of the Roman Com|monwealth in pre&s;erving their ancient Frugality, and not to di&s;tingui&s;h the Ladies for greater Extravagance than the Men; &s;o far from it, that taking the whole into Con|&s;ideration, the other Sex are va&s;tly more inexcu&s;able for Levity and the Folly of Dre&s;s.</P>
<P>DOUBTLESS, prudent Laws to regulate Extravagance,
<PB N="15" REF="006612_0015_1029520A66D095A0">
would have a very good Effect; but at the &s;ame Time, the Polite Part of the Society, Gentlemen of Figure and Character might by their Example effectuate it. It is what is nece&s;&s;ary to be done, and the different Characters in Life ought to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves in it.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Article which de&s;erves Con&s;ideration, is the <HI>Improvement of our Soil.</HI> And here is &s;uch a large Field of Variety, to range in, that it requires not only Skill but Indu&s;try to cultivate it. The Art of Hu&s;bandry, however trifling it may appear, is a Subject equal to the greate&s;t Genius; and the proper Application of &s;uch a Genius would make it va&s;tly &s;erviceable to any Community. Mankind are very fondly attached to the Cu&s;toms of their Predece&s;&s;ors, and adopt them as their &s;econd Nature; and hence, by being &s;o loth to leave the old Road, they cramp that Invention which might be very u&s;eful in Life, and from which they might reap a double Profit: So that it &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary in &s;uch a Country as this, for a Legi&s;lature to incourage Improvements of this Nature; by making it worth the while to deviate from &s;uch old Roads or Cu&s;toms; which after they have &s;o done renders needle&s;s any future Provi&s;ions of the &s;ame Nature: for the Intere&s;t of Mankind will be &s;ufficient to induce them to &s;uch Practices, when they are once convinced from Ex|periment that that Intere&s;t is advanced thereby. We &s;upply our&s;elves from other Governments, in a great Mea|&s;ure, with Provi&s;ions of various Sorts, which Strangers tell us, is a Shame for us to do; and we our&s;elves ought to think it a Shame; for we have many different Soils, as well adapted to tho&s;e Nece&s;&s;aries of Life as our Neigh|bours. <HI>Corn, Rye, Barley</HI> and <HI>Oats</HI> we are &s;ure, from our own Experience, are quite ea&s;y to be rai&s;ed among us; and I believe, were we as indu&s;trious as &s;ome other Nations, we &s;hould rai&s;e enough not only for our own Con&s;umption, but al&s;o for Exportation, if required; but in&s;tead of &s;o doing, we pay large Sums for tho&s;e Commodities to &s;ome of our neighbouring Provinces. The main Difficulty is, rai&s;ing of <HI>Wheat,</HI> but even as to that Article (for which
<PB N="16" REF="006612_0016_1029520F5C9D2648">
we pay a great Ballance to others) it may doubtle&s;s be produced among our&s;elves; for why &s;hould not tho&s;e County's e&s;pecially which are contiguous to the <HI>Connec|ticut</HI> Wheat Soil be as capable of producing it as that Soil is: Surely every Argument that is urged again&s;t this important Affair mu&s;t be the Effect of Indolence; for it is well known that in many Counties of this Province good <HI>Wheat</HI> has been rai&s;ed to Advantage. But it &s;eems our Wheat is &s;ubject to <HI>Smut</HI> and <HI>Mildew</HI>: And &s;o it is in <HI>England</HI>; but pray is not <HI>England</HI> one of the mo&s;t re|markable <HI>Wheat</HI> Countries in the World? Doubtle&s;s, was there a proper Bounty given for the rai&s;ing it, we &s;hould &s;oon learn &s;o much of the Art of Hu&s;bandry, as to prevent tho&s;e <HI>Smuts</HI> and <HI>Mildews</HI> with as much Ea&s;e as others do. And I am apt to think that Ob&s;ervation, made by a Gentleman of Di&s;cernment, is very ju&s;t, viz. that <HI>Wheat</HI> is very &s;ubject to Bla&s;t in the rainy Sea&s;ons of Paper Money.</P>
<P>A Bounty given to the manufacturing of what <HI>Wheat</HI> we rai&s;ed, into <HI>Flour,</HI> would be another prudential Method, if we would only con&s;ider how many thou&s;and Barrels of this we yearly import into the Province.</P>
<P>BARLEY is an Article of great Con&s;equence, and I ne|ver heard a Farmer that ever rai&s;ed it, but would allow it was a profitable Improvement of Land. Some Lands will produce <HI>&s;ixty</HI> Bu&s;hels an Acre; and &s;uppo&s;e but <HI>twenty</HI> Bu&s;hels are allowed, the Thing &s;peaks for it&s;elf: And if we &s;hould get into this Practice in general, we &s;hould not only reap the Profits of our Trouble by a Crop, but it would al&s;o introduce the Cu&s;tom of drinking <HI>Malt Liquors,</HI> on which an hard Labourer in <HI>England</HI> will work and grow fat and healthy, while a lazy Labourer here, in the U&s;e of &s;piritous Liquors, and of <HI>Cyder</HI> made from Fruit bad in its own Nature and rotten by Carele&s;s|ne&s;s, will grow as Meagre as his Liquor, &s;tarve his Family, and entail the Cur&s;e of a bad Con&s;titution on his Po&s;terity.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="006612_0017_102952125ACD4460">BUT what is of as great Con&s;equence as any Kind of Produce, is the rai&s;ing <HI>Hemp</HI> and <HI>Flax.</HI> There are many Tuns of Shipping built in this Province, and large Quan|tities of tho&s;e Articles are u&s;ed upon our Navigation; and more particularly of the former, which comes to us through &s;everal Hands, and mu&s;t therefore co&s;t us dear; whereas by proper Economy, we might not only rai&s;e enough for the Navigation of the Province, but might afford in a &s;hort Time, to &s;hip it to our Mother Country; which would not only be an ea&s;y Way of paying for the Manufactures we depend on her for, but would al&s;o be a Saving to the Nation, in Proportion as what we &s;hipped to <HI>England</HI> would le&s;&s;en their Importation from the Nor|thern Countrys. This may perhaps look chimerical at fir&s;t View; but it is a Fact capable of being proved: for in <HI>Holland</HI> or <HI>Ireland</HI> the Produce of an Acre of Hemp on good Land is <HI>one</HI> Tun, but &s;uppo&s;ing it would pro|duce here but <HI>half</HI> of a Tun; yet upon a Calculation of the Labour to rai&s;e it and dre&s;s it, and the Price it pro|duces, it will turn out a very profitable Article; be&s;ides, a great Part of the Labour may be performed in the Win|ter Sea&s;on, when Labour is of le&s;s Value than in any other Part of the Year; and be&s;ides even this, a va&s;t Deal of Labour might be &s;aved by managing &s;ome Part of its Ma|nufacture with Waterworks. Suppo&s;ing then upon the whole, that we have a Demand for our own U&s;e, for <HI>four hundred Tuns</HI> per Year, which &s;ome think a large Calcu|lation; yet this Quantity requires, at the above Compu|tation of its Produce, no more than <HI>eight hundred</HI> Acres of Land; and will any one &s;ugge&s;t that &s;o many Acres &s;uitable to rai&s;e Hemp upon, cannot be picked out of the whole Province? It is confirmed by many that have rai&s;ed it, that though it was laborious to go through the whole Proce&s;s of it, yet that it was at la&s;t very profitable. As to the Objection of not having Land &s;uitable for it, it is quite idle; for it is well known, that we have very large Tracts of low Lands, which lie uncultivated notwith&s;tand|ing their being the riche&s;t Soils we have; but the Dif|ficulty of clearing them deters many from the Work.
<PB N="18" REF="006612_0018_10295213E7D29C50">
Tho&s;e Lands, if they were cleared (as they might be in the Winter Sea&s;on when People have little el&s;e to do, ex|cepting their Attendance on the nece&s;&s;ary and important Avocations of a Tavern) we &s;hould find to be &s;ome of our be&s;t E&s;tates: This is a Fact, which a few Experiments have made inconte&s;table, and to increa&s;e Experiments upon it, would make the mo&s;t ample Amends.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame Arguments here u&s;ed for rai&s;ing <HI>Hemp</HI> may &s;erve for rai&s;ing <HI>Flax,</HI> which is another important Article of Produce. It is &s;aid, that the Town of <HI>Nutfield</HI> in <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> Government, manufactures into Linnen to the Amount of <HI>thirty</HI> or <HI>forty thou&s;and Pounds</HI> Old Tenor per Year; and why the whole Province of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay</HI> may not do &s;omething on this Head in &s;ome Proportion to the Town of <HI>Nutfield,</HI> would be very difficult to a&s;&s;ign a good Rea&s;on for. We import &s;uch large Quantities of foreign Linnen, that a proper Degree of Emulation and Indu&s;try would &s;ave a large Ballance to the Province. Some that are always fond of Excu&s;es for their Indolence, will &s;ay, that our Soil is not adapted to <HI>Hemp</HI> and <HI>Flax</HI>; but be&s;ides the An&s;wer ju&s;t now given to this Objection, I would beg Leave to &s;ubjoin another, viz. That we can make Soils if we cannot find them: but as this comes more properly under the <HI>Art of Hu&s;bandry,</HI> I would refer tho&s;e, who are in Earne&s;t, to the Authors who treat on this Subject, and particu|larly to the Pamphlets on <HI>Field Hu&s;bandry,</HI> which are annually publi&s;hed by the <HI>Rev. Mr.</HI> JARED ELIOT <HI>of Killing&s;worth in Connecticut,</HI> which &s;hew &s;o much good Sen&s;e, founded on his own and the mo&s;t authentick Ex|periments, and are &s;o peculiarly adapted to our Climate, that every Farmer ought to have them by him, and to teach them to his Children, as including in them not the lea&s;t Part of the Duty which they owe to their Country.</P>
<P>BUT that which is of the la&s;t Importance, and mu&s;t be the Foundation of all other Pro&s;perity is, the Increa&s;e of
<PB N="19" REF="006612_0019_102952171E450600">
our <HI>Inhabitants</HI>: And without this, the large&s;t Tracts, be&s;t &s;ituated and mo&s;t luxuriant Soil under Heaven avails no|thing. But here I am in &s;ome Mea&s;ure anticipated by a well-timed prudent Re&s;olve of the General A&s;&s;embly in their la&s;t Se&s;&s;ions, in lending the <HI>Province Ship</HI> for the Importation, and in appropriating <HI>four Town&s;hips</HI> for the Settlement of Foreigners; a Conduct highly becoming the Paternal Care, of tho&s;e, who are &s;tiled the <HI>Fathers of their Country.</HI> When we con&s;ider the Lo&s;s of &s;o many thou&s;ands of our be&s;t Labouring Men in the Cour&s;e of a few Years pa&s;t, we ought not to &s;it &s;till and de&s;pair, but to repair the Misfortune as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. We &s;ee the happy Effect of &s;uch a Mea&s;ure in the Province of <HI>Pen|&s;ylvania</HI>; where &s;o many have been imported of late Years, that their Cities, their Trade, and their Riches have increa&s;ed to a prodigious Degree. Let us only con|&s;ider that the Labour of <HI>five hundred</HI> Men, as Wages are now, will amount to <HI>fifty thou&s;and Pound</HI> per Year Profit; and whether that Sum is not worth &s;aving, let any judge. It is the Number of indu&s;trious <HI>Inhabitants</HI> that mu&s;t en|rich a Country; it is their Number that mu&s;t make the Charges of Government &s;it light and ea&s;y, when &s;uch Charges do ari&s;e; and it is their Number that mu&s;t be the chief Defence of a Province, expo&s;ed, as we are, to the Ravages of an Enemy on an extended Frontier: Let then the Number of indu&s;trious foreign Prote&s;tants be &s;till encouraged. In this Method we &s;hall not only alle|viate our Lo&s;s of Men, but in all Probability the Lo&s;s of many u&s;eful Artificers, who have been taken off by the late Wars.</P>
<P>SOME are very fond of the Name of Po&s;terity, and think the Introduction of Foreigners would oblige their Children to &s;ell their Country; but if they would only be plea&s;ed to con&s;ider one Moment, that if Inhabitants were to in|crea&s;e only in a Cour&s;e of Nature, how many <HI>Millions</HI> of Acres would in this Province lie uncultivated; and that their own E&s;tates would be of little Value in this ordinary Way of Generation; whereas notwith&s;tanding the Intro|duction
<PB N="20" REF="006612_0020_1029521A71DBEE68">
of Foreigners, they might &s;ave as much Land for their Children as they would cultivate in many Generations; and at the &s;ame Time rai&s;e the Value of what they could conveniently &s;pare to others; unle&s;s they will carry their Fore&s;ight to <HI>ten thou&s;and</HI> Generations; and if they are &s;o overprudent as this, I will allow they will want not only another Province for Po&s;terity, but al&s;o another Continent. But I &s;hould be glad &s;uch Objectors would a&s;k them&s;elves, whether in Ca&s;e of another <HI>French War</HI> they would not be willing to have others bear a &s;mall Part, at lea&s;t, of the Burden of Military Duties, and Taxes con&s;equent thereon.</P>
<P>I have gone through the &s;everal Articles I purpo&s;ed to mention, tho' many other things are left untouched, and willingly leave the Con&s;ideration of them to the Friends of their Country. If any Thing of Importance has been offered, I doubt not it will have its due Weight. What|ever is di&s;agreeable, unpopular, inaccurate or trifling, I hope will be overlooked, as the whole was de&s;igned for the Be|nefit of the Province. I was induced to mention them at this Time, as the Re&s;ult of the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion of the General A&s;&s;embly is looked upon as an Earne&s;t of much future Good, and as the A&s;&s;embly is not again met: And &s;hould any of tho&s;e Articles be worth their Notice, the acting their Part immediately might have the happie&s;t In|fluence on the Pro&s;perity of the Province. One Year &s;aved, in our particular happy Circum&s;tances, might pro|bably produce the mo&s;t beneficial Con&s;equences, and the Lo&s;s of a Se&s;&s;ion might be productive <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the mo&s;t unhappy.</P>
