<P>IT will, perhaps, be asked, why the detail of common place observations and arguments which the following Dis|course presents, was thought necessary at the present day, on a subject so well understood, and concerning which there is so little variety of opinion among enlightened men?&mdash;To this question it may be answered, that this Discourse being the first that was delivered, in consequence of a late deter|mination of the Society to institute an Annual Oration, it was thought pardonable, and even proper, to begin with an <HI>elementary</HI> view of the subject&mdash;that the subject of slavery, however familiarly understood by a few benevolent indivi|duals among us, has been but little attended to by the gene|rality of our citizens; and that, strange as it may seem, the objections and principles which the Author combats are daily advanced, with confidence, by many with whom he converses.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Friends, and Fellow Citizens,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN meeting you on this occa&s;ion, I am deeply impre&s;&s;ed with circum&s;tances which demand the warme&s;t congratulations. We cannot &s;urvey the pre&s;ent condition of the civilized world, without forming a contra&s;t, at once plea&s;ing and melancholy, between our peaceful and happy &s;ituation, and the convul&s;ed and di&s;tracted &s;tate of tho&s;e countries with which we are mo&s;t nearly connected. No in|vidious feelings&mdash;no in&s;en&s;ibility to the calamities of others, will be &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;ugge&s;t this compa|ri&s;on. It is forced upon us by a conjuncture in human affairs &s;o extraordinary and intere&s;ting, that no one can be inattentive to it&mdash;&s;o gloomy and dark, that none can calculate the danger, or &s;ee the end.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="032477_0006_0FF285DDA01CDEF8">
At this aera, momentous at pre&s;ent, but &s;till more pregnant with the future, the voice of Hu|manity, alas! is but too &s;eldom heard. Per&s;ecuted and cha&s;ed from almo&s;t every corner of the globe, &s;he knows not where to find an a&s;ylum. The &s;truggles of Ambition, gra&s;ping and devouring every thing within his reach; and the de&s;olations of War, widely &s;pread, and murderous beyond former example, exhibit the prominent features of Europe, and engro&s;s, almo&s;t exclu&s;ively, the atten|tion of the pa&s;&s;ing hour. Europe, more highly favoured and cultivated than the re&s;t of the world, and regarding the other quarters of the globe with a fa&s;tidious &s;uperiority, is become as pre-eminent in crimes, as in opulence, refinement, and power. She offers few examples, but tho&s;e of rapine and violence&mdash;little intercour&s;e, but &s;uch as is calcu|lated to corrupt and de&s;troy.</P>
<P>From &s;cenes equally affecting to our view, and de&s;tructive to human happine&s;s, let us turn away our eyes, and fix them on the means of promoting the welfare and improvement of our own country. Among the&s;e, there is one object which pathetically invites our attention. The in&s;titution of the SOCIETY which I have now the honour to addre&s;s, and the occa&s;ion of the pre&s;ent meeting, de&s;ignate this object. The importance of it can e&s;cape the ob&s;ervation of none. For, however ju&s;tly we may prize the comparative felicity of our country; how|ever
<PB N="9" REF="032477_0007_0FF285DF4452C408">
ju&s;tly we may exult in the excellence of our Con&s;titution, and the humanity of our laws; we are forbidden to be idle, while a &s;ingle &s;ource of human mi&s;ery, admitting of relief, remains to tar|ni&s;h our character.</P>
<P>That, in the clo&s;e of the eighteenth century, it &s;hould be e&s;teemed proper and nece&s;&s;ary, in any civilized country, to in&s;titute di&s;cour&s;es to oppo&s;e the &s;lavery and commerce of the human &s;pecies, is a wonderful fact in the annals of &s;ociety! But that this country &s;hould be America, is a &s;oleci&s;m only to be accounted for by the general incon&s;i&s;t|ency of the human character. But, after all the &s;urpri&s;e that Patrioti&s;m can feel, and all the Indig|nation that Morality can &s;ugge&s;t on this &s;ubject, the humiliating tale mu&s;t be told&mdash;that in this free country&mdash;in this country, the plains of which are &s;till &s;tained with blood &s;hed in the cau&s;e of liberty,&mdash;in this country, from which has been proclaimed to di&s;tant lands, as the ba&s;is of our political exi&s;t|ence, the noble principle, that "ALL MEN ARE BORN FREE AND EQUAL,"&mdash;in this country there are &s;laves!&mdash;men are bought and &s;old! Strange, indeed! that the bo&s;om which glows at the name of liberty in general, and the arm which has been &s;o vigorou&s;ly exerted in vindication of human rights, &s;hould yet be found leagued on the &s;ide of oppre&s;&s;ion, and oppo&s;ing their avowed prin|ciples!</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="032477_0008_0FF285E3FB75CD40">
Much, indeed, has been done by many benevo|lent individuals and &s;ocieties, to aboli&s;h this di&s;|graceful practice, and to improve the condition of tho&s;e unhappy people, whom the ignorance or the avarice of our ance&s;tors has bequeathed to us as &s;laves. Still, however, notwith&s;tanding all the la|bours and eloquence which have been directed again&s;t it, the evil continues; &s;till laws and prac|tices exi&s;t, which loudly call for reform; &s;till MORE THAN HALF A MILLION of our fellow creatures in the United States are deprived of that which, next to life, is the deare&s;t birth-right of man.</P>
<P>To deliver the plain dictates of humanity, ju&s;|tice, religion, and good policy, on this &s;ubject, is the de&s;ign of the pre&s;ent di&s;cour&s;e. In doing this, it will not be expected that any thing new &s;hould be offered. It is not a new &s;ubject; and every point of view in which it can be con&s;idered has been long &s;ince rendered familiar by the ingenious and the humane. All that is left for me is, to bring to your remembrance principles which, how|ever well known, cannot be too often repeated; and to exhibit &s;ome of the mo&s;t obvious arguments again&s;t an evil which, though generally acknow|ledged, is &s;till practically per&s;i&s;ted in.</P>
<P>And here I &s;hall pa&s;s over in &s;ilence the unnum|bered cruelties, and the violations of every natural and &s;ocial tie, which mark the African trade, and
<PB N="11" REF="032477_0009_0FF285E8668E9718">
which attend the injured captives in dragging them from their native &s;hores, and from all the attach|ments of life. I &s;hall not call you to contemplate the mi&s;eries and hard&s;hips which follow them into &s;ervitude, and render their life a cup of unmingled bitterne&s;s. Unwilling to wound your feelings, or my own, by the melancholy recital, over the&s;e &s;cenes I would willingly draw a veil; and confine my&s;elf to principles and views of the &s;ubject more immediately applicable to our&s;elves.</P>
<P>That en&s;laving, or continuing to hold in &s;lavery, tho&s;e who have forfeited their liberty by no crime, is contrary to the dictates both of ju&s;tice and hu|manity, I tru&s;t few who hear me will be di&s;po&s;ed to deny. However the judgment of &s;ome may be bia&s;&s;ed by the &s;uppo&s;ed peculiarity of certain ca&s;es, I pre&s;ume that, with regard to the ab&s;tract prin|ciple, there can be but one opinion among en|lightened and candid minds. What is the end of all &s;ocial connection but the advancement of hu|man happine&s;s? And what can be a more plain and indi&s;putable principle of republican govern|ment, than that all the right which &s;ociety po&s;&s;e&s;s over individuals, or one man over another, mu&s;t be founded either upon contract, expre&s;s or im|plied, or upon forfeiture by crime? But, are the Africans and their de&s;cendants en&s;laved upon either of the&s;e principles? Have they voluntarily &s;ur|rendered their liberty to their whiter brethren? Or
<PB N="12" REF="032477_0010_0FF285EA1A155E40">
have they forfeited their natural right to it by the violation of any law? Neither of the&s;e is pre|tended by the mo&s;t zealous advocates for &s;lavery. By what ties, then, are they held in &s;ervitude? By the ties of force and inju&s;tice only; by ties which are equally oppo&s;ed to the rea&s;on of things, and to the fundamental principles of all legitimate a&s;&s;ociation.</P>
<P>In the pre&s;ent age and country, none, I pre|&s;ume&punc; will re&s;t a defence of &s;lavery on the ground of &s;uperior force; the right of captivity; or any &s;imilar principle, which the ignorance and the fe|rocity of ancient times admitted as a ju&s;tifiable tenure of property. It is to be hoped the time is pa&s;&s;ed, never more to return, when men would recognize maxims as &s;ubver&s;ive of morality as they are of &s;ocial happine&s;s. Can the laws and rights of war be properly drawn into precedent for the imitation of &s;ober and regular government? Can we &s;anction the dete&s;table idea, that liberty is only an advantage gained by &s;trength, and not a right derived from nature's God? Such &s;entiments become the abodes of demons, rather than &s;ocieties of civilized men.</P>
<P>Pride, indeed, may contend, that the&s;e unhappy &s;ubjects of our oppre&s;&s;ion are an <HI>inferior race of beings;</HI> and are therefore a&s;&s;igned by the &s;tricte&s;t ju&s;tice to a depre&s;&s;ed and &s;ervile &s;tation in &s;ociety. But in what does this inferiority con&s;i&s;t? In a
<PB N="13" REF="032477_0011_0FF285F147E0EC08">
difference of <HI>complexion</HI> and <HI>figure?</HI> Let the nar|row and illiberal mind, who can advance &s;uch an argument, recollect whither it will carry him. In traver&s;ing the various regions of the earth, from the Equator to the Pole, we find an infinite diver|&s;ity of &s;hades in the complexion of men, from the darke&s;t to the faire&s;t hues. If, then, the proper &s;tation of the African is that of &s;ervitude and de|pre&s;&s;ion, we mu&s;t al&s;o contend, that every Portu|gue&s;e and Spaniard is, though in a le&s;s degree, in|ferior to us, and &s;hould be &s;ubject to a mea&s;ure of the &s;ame degradation. Nay, if the tints of colour be con&s;idered the te&s;t of human dignity, we may ju&s;tly a&s;&s;ume a haughty &s;uperiority over our &s;outhern brethren of this continent, and devi&s;e their &s;ubju|gation. In &s;hort, upon this principle, where &s;hall liberty end? or where &s;hall &s;lavery begin? At what grade is it that the ties of blood are to cea&s;e? And how many &s;hades mu&s;t we de&s;cend &s;till lower in the &s;cale, before mercy is to vani&s;h with them?</P>
<P>But, perhaps, it will be &s;ugge&s;ted, that the Af|ricans and their de&s;cendants are inferior to their whiter brethren in <HI>intellectual capacity,</HI> if not in complexion and figure. This is &s;trongly a&s;&s;erted, but upon what ground? Becau&s;e we do not &s;ee men who labour under every di&s;advantage, and who have every opening faculty bla&s;ted and de|&s;troyed by their depre&s;&s;ed condition, &s;ignalize them&s;elves as philo&s;ophers? Becau&s;e we do not find
<PB N="14" REF="032477_0012_0FF285F54D18C880">
men who are almo&s;t entirely cut off from every &s;ource of mental improvement, ri&s;ing to literary honours? To &s;uppo&s;e the Africans of an inferior radical character, becau&s;e they have not thus di&s;|tingui&s;hed them&s;elves, is ju&s;t as rational as to &s;up|po&s;e every private citizen of an inferior &s;pecies, who has not rai&s;ed him&s;elf to the condition of royalty. But, the truth is, many of the negroes di&s;cover great ingenuity, notwith&s;tanding their circum&s;tances are &s;o depre&s;&s;ed, and &s;o unfavourable to all cultivation. They become excellent me|chanics and practical mu&s;icians, and, indeed, learn every thing their ma&s;ters take the pains to teach them.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Having been, for two years, a monthly visitor of the African School in this city, I directed particular attention to the capacity and behaviour of the scholars, with a view to sa|tisfy myself on the point in question. And, to me, the negro children of that institution appeared, in general, quite as or|derly, and quite as ready to learn, as white children.</NOTE> And how far they might improve in this re&s;pect, were the &s;ame advantages conferred on them that freemen enjoy, is impo&s;&s;ible for us to decide until the experiment be made.</P>
<P>ARISTOTLE long ago &s;aid&mdash;<Q>Men of little genius, and great bodily &s;trength, are by nature de&s;tined to &s;erve, and tho&s;e of a better capacity to command. The natives of Greece, and of &s;ome other countries, being naturally &s;uperior in genius, have a natural right to empire; and the re&s;t of mankind, being naturally &s;tupid, are de&s;|tined
<PB N="15" REF="032477_0013_0FF285F9DC5C19F0">
to labour and &s;lavery.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De Republ. lib. i. cap. 5, 6.</NOTE> What would this great philo&s;opher have thought of his own rea&s;oning, had he lived till the pre&s;ent day? On the one hand, he would have &s;een his country|men, of who&s;e genius he boa&s;ts &s;o much, lo&s;e with their liberty all mental character; while, on the other, he would have &s;een many nations, whom he con&s;igned to everla&s;ting &s;tupidity, &s;hew them|&s;elves equal in intellectual power to the mo&s;t ex|alted of human kind.</P>
<P>Again&mdash;Avarice may clamorou&s;ly contend, that the <HI>laws of property</HI> ju&s;tify &s;lavery; and that every one has an undoubted right to whatever has been obtained by <HI>fair purcha&s;e</HI> or <HI>regular de&s;cent.</HI> To this demand the an&s;wer is plain. The right which every man has to his per&s;onal liberty is paramount to all the laws of property. The right which every one has to <HI>him&s;elf</HI> infinitely tran&s;cends all other human tenures. Of con&s;equence, the latter can never be &s;et in oppo&s;ition to the former. I do not mean, at pre&s;ent, to decide the que&s;tion, whether the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of &s;laves, when called upon by public authority to manumit them, &s;hould be indemnified for the lo&s;s they &s;u&s;tain. This is a &s;eparate que&s;|tion, and mu&s;t be decided by a different tribunal from that before which I bring the general &s;ubject. All I contend for at pre&s;ent is, that no claims of property can ever ju&s;tly interfere with, or be &s;uf|fered
<PB N="16" REF="032477_0014_0FF285FB80784510">
to impede the operation of that noble and eternal principle, that <Q>all men are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights&mdash;and that among the&s;e are life, liberty, and the pur&s;uit of happine&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e principles and remarks would doubtle&s;s appear &s;elf-evident to all, were the ca&s;e of the unhappy Africans for a moment made our own. Were it made a que&s;tion, whether ju&s;tice per|mitted the &s;able race of Guinea to carry us away captive from our own country, and from all its tender attachments, to their own land, and there en&s;lave us and our po&s;terity for ever;&mdash;were it made a que&s;tion, I &s;ay, whether all this would be con&s;i&s;tent with ju&s;tice and humanity, one univer&s;al and clamorous negative would &s;how how abhorrent the principle is from our minds, when not blinded by prejudice. Tell us, ye who were lately pining in ALGERINE BONDAGE! tell us whether all the wretched &s;ophi&s;try of pride, or of avarice, could ever reconcile you to the chains of barbarians, or convince you that man had a right to oppre&s;s and injure man? Tell us what were your feelings, when you heard the pityle&s;s tyrant, who had taken or bought you, plead either of the&s;e rights for your detention; and ju&s;tify him&s;elf by the &s;pecious pretences of capture or of purcha&s;e, in riveting your chains?</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="032477_0015_0FF285FD241388E0">
Let none &s;ay, that, notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e rea|&s;onings, the &s;laves are <HI>happier</HI> in a &s;tate of &s;ervitude, than they would be if &s;et at liberty, e&s;pecially when they are treated with lenity, and provided for in a comfortable manner. That there are different de|grees of wretchedne&s;s among them, in different cir|cum&s;tances, no one can doubt: and when they fall into the hands of the humane and kind, their depre&s;|&s;ion is le&s;s&mdash;far le&s;s mi&s;erable, than when the torture of whips, the pains of hunger and nakedne&s;s, and the unrea&s;onable impo&s;itions of hard ta&s;k-ma&s;ters, are added to &s;ervitude. On this account, I am happy in being able to &s;ay, that the lot of &s;laves among us is, in general, much more tolerable than that of tho&s;e in &s;ome other parts even of our own country. But &s;till they are both in bondage. However favoured the &s;ituation of either, they are both deprived of that ble&s;&s;ing, in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of which the barren rock has its joys, and without which Eden it&s;elf would be a gloomy &s;cene. After all the &s;ordid pleas of tho&s;e who would mea&s;ure out enjoyment for them, they are forced to &s;ubmit to an evil which, <Q>how|ever di&s;gui&s;ed, is a bitter draught, and ever will be &s;o till Nature her&s;elf &s;hall change.</Q></P>
<P>But higher laws than tho&s;e of common ju&s;tice and humanity may be urged again&s;t &s;lavery. I mean THE LAWS OF GOD, revealed in the &s;crip|tures of truth. This divine &s;y&s;tem, in which we profe&s;s to believe and to glory, teaches us, that
<PB N="18" REF="032477_0016_0FF28604F0B25EA0">
<HI>God has made of one blood all nations of men tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> dwell on the face of the whole earth.</HI> It teaches us, that, of whatever kindred or people, we are all children of the &s;ame common Father; dependent on the &s;ame mighty power; and candidates for the &s;ame glorious immortality. It teaches us, that we &s;hould do to all men whatever we, in like circum|&s;tances, would that they &s;hould do unto us. It teaches us, in a word, that love to man, and a con&s;tant pur&s;uit of human happine&s;s, is the &s;um of all &s;ocial duty.&mdash;Principles the&s;e, which wage eternal war both with political and dome&s;tic &s;lave|ry&mdash;Principles which forbid every &s;pecies of domi|nation, excepting that which is founded on con|&s;ent, or which the welfare of &s;ociety requires.</P>
<P>There have not been wanting, indeed, men as ignorant as they were impious, who have appealed to the &s;acred &s;criptures for a defence of &s;lavery. They have dared to &s;eek for a ju&s;tification of in|juries and oppre&s;&s;ion in a volume, which teaches nothing but <HI>peace on earth, and good will towards men.</HI> As a &s;pecimen of their rea&s;oning&mdash;Some have contended, <Q>that the Africans are the po&s;te|rity of HAM, one of the &s;ons of NOAH; that, as it was declared by divine in&s;piration, that his de&s;cendants &s;hould be &s;ervants to their brethren, &s;o reducing them to a &s;tate of &s;lavery is only ac|compli&s;hing the will of heaven.</Q>&mdash;But this plea can never be maintained, either upon the ground
<PB N="19" REF="032477_0017_0FF28611611C0748">
of <HI>fact,</HI> or of <HI>&s;ober principle.</HI> The cur&s;e pronounced upon HAM was evidently a limited one, and ex|tended only to a part of his po&s;terity. It was only &s;aid, that the de&s;cendants of CANAAN, one of the four &s;ons of HAM, &s;hould &s;erve the po&s;terity of SHEM and JAPHET. This cur&s;e, then, had no|thing to do with the African nations, who have been &s;o much abu&s;ed by the civilized world; but was partly fulfilled, when the de&s;cendants of CA|NAAN in PALESTINE became <HI>hewers of wood and drawers of water</HI> to the ISRAELITES, who were the de&s;cendants of SHEM: and afterwards was com|pletely accompli&s;hed, when the CARTHAGINIANS and TYRIANS were &s;ubdued by SCIPIO and ALEXANDER.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See STACKHOUSE'S History of the Bible, vol. i. p. 268, 269.</NOTE></P>
<P>But, admitting the cur&s;e pronounced upon HAM to have all the meaning and exten&s;ion which the advocates for &s;lavery contend; yet we are to re|member it was <HI>prophetical</HI> in its nature; and though infinite Wi&s;dom de&s;igned to fulfil it, &s;till it is plain, the agents in bringing about the fulfilment cannot be con&s;idered the le&s;s criminal on this account. It was prophe&s;ied, that the SAVIOUR OF THE WORLD &s;hould be crucified, long before that important event took place; and yet, I pre&s;ume, none ever &s;uppo&s;ed that this con&s;ideration exculpated his murderers. The truth is, if our being made in&s;tru|ments

The &s;entiments of the wi&s;e and the good, and the fun|damental principles of our government, mu&s;t have a powerful operation, and they are both on your &s;ide. <Q>Though you cannot controul Legi&s;latures; and though, when you plead the cau&s;e of huma|nity, they will not at all times li&s;ten to you; yet there are other means in your power, perhaps, even more effectual. You can do much by di|recting your efforts to the conviction of indivi|duals; by diffu&s;ing proper publications among them; and by pre&s;enting the evils of &s;lavery, in various forms, to their minds.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Address of the Convention of 1796, to the New-York Society.</NOTE></P>

The time, I tru&s;t, is not far di&s;tant, when there &s;hall be no &s;lavery to lament&mdash;no oppre&s;&s;ion to op|po&s;e in the United States:&mdash;when the EMANCI|PATING SPIRIT of our Con&s;titution &s;hall go forth in "the greatne&s;s of her &s;trength," breaking in pieces every chain, and trampling down every un|ju&s;t effort of power:&mdash;when &s;he &s;hall proclaim, even to the &s;tranger and the &s;ojourner, the moment he &s;ets his foot upon American earth, that the ground on which he treads is &s;acred to LIBERTY; and that the air which he breathes, nouri&s;hes FREEMEN ONLY:&mdash;when every being, who bears the name of MAN, whatever complexion an equa|torial Sun may have burnt upon him, and with whatever &s;olemn inju&s;tice his rights may have been infringed, &s;hall enjoy the privileges, and be rai&s;ed to the dignity which belong to the human cha|racter.</P>
