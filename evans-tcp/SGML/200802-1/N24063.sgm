<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the multiplicity of School-Books now in u&s;e, it has been often &s;ugge&s;ted, that a Selection, calculated particularly for Dialogue and Declamation, would be of exten&s;ive utility in our &s;eminaries.</P>
<P>The art of Oratory needs no encomium. To cultivate its rudiments, and diffu&s;e its &s;pirit among the Youth of America, is the de&s;ign of this Book.</P>
<P>Of the many pieces which this volume contains, three only are to be found in any publication of the kind. A large proportion is entirely original. For a&s;&s;i&s;tance in this part, the Author acknowledges him&s;elf indebted to &s;everal friends, who&s;e names he is not au|thorized to divulge.</P>
<P>The <HI>COLUMBIAN ORATOR</HI> is de&s;igned for a Second Part to the <HI>AMERICAN PRECEPTOR</HI>; for this rea&s;on, no pieces are in&s;erted from that book.</P>
<P>As no advantage could ari&s;e from a methodical ar|rangement, the Author has preferred variety to &s;y&s;|tem. In his choice of materials, it has been his object to &s;elect &s;uch as &s;hould in&s;pire the pupil with the <HI>ardor of eloquence,</HI> and the <HI>love of virtue.</HI> He has &s;pared no pains to render the Work, in every re&s;pect, worthy of the generous patronage, which a liberal public have be&s;towed on his former publications.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="instructions">
<HEAD>OF PRONUNCIATION IN GENERAL.</HEAD>
<P>THE be&s;t judges among the ancients have repre|&s;ented Pronunciation, which they likewi&s;e called Action, as the principal part of an orator's province; from whence he is chiefly to expect &s;ucce&s;s in the art of per&s;ua&s;ion. When Cicero, in the per&s;on of Cra&s;&s;us, has largely and elegantly di&s;cour&s;ed upon all the other parts of oratory, coming at la&s;t to &s;peak of thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> he &s;ays, "All the former have their effect as they are pronoun|ced. It is the action alone which governs in &s;peaking; without which the be&s;t orator is of no value; and is often defeated by one, in other re&s;pects, much his in|ferior." And he lets us know, that Demo&s;thenes was of the &s;ame opinion; who, when he was a&s;ked <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> was the principal thing in oratory, replied <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and being a&s;ked again a &s;econd and a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> was next con&s;iderable, he &s;till made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="031827_0006_0FEEC2BDA773E250">And, indeed, if he had not judged this highly nece&s;|&s;ary for an orator, he would &s;carcely have taken &s;o much pains in correcting tho&s;e natural defects, under which he labored at fir&s;t, in order to acquire it. For he had both a weak voice, and likewi&s;e an impediment in his &s;peech, &s;o that he could not pronounce di&s;tinctly &s;ome particular letters. The former of which defects he conquered, partly by &s;peaking as loud as he could upon the &s;hore, when the &s;ea roared and was boi&s;ter|ous; and partly, by pronouncing long periods as he walked up hill; both of which methods contributed to &s;trengthen his voice. And he found means to ren|der his pronunciation more clear and articulate, by the help of &s;ome little &s;tones put under his tongue. Nor was he le&s;s careful in endeavoring to gain the habit of a becoming and decent ge&s;ture; for which purpo&s;e he u&s;ed to pronounce his di&s;cour&s;es alone before a large gla&s;s. And becau&s;e he had an ill cu&s;tom of drawing up his &s;houlders when he &s;poke, to amend that, he u&s;ed to place them under a &s;word, which hung over him with the point downward.</P>
<P>Such pains did this prince of the Grecian orators take to remove tho&s;e difficulties, which would have been &s;ufficient to di&s;courage an inferior, and le&s;s a&s;piring genius. And to how great a perfection he arrived in his action, under all the&s;e di&s;advantages, by his inde|fatigable diligence and application, is evident from the confe&s;&s;ion of his great adver&s;ary and rival in oratory, E&s;chines; who, when he could not bear the di&s;grace of being wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ted by Demo&s;thenes in the cau&s;e of Cte&s;iphon, retired to Rhodes. And being de&s;ired by the inhab|itants, he recited to them his own oration upon that occa&s;ion; the next day they reque&s;ted of him to let them hear that of Demo&s;thenes; which, having pronounced in a mo&s;t graceful manner, to the admiration of all who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> pre&s;ent, "How much more (&s;ays he) would you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">red, if you had heard him &s;peak it him&s;elf!" <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> to the&s;e authorities the judgment of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;ays, that "It is not of &s;o much mo|ment
<PB N="9" REF="031827_0007_0FEEC2C077FBC598">
what our compo&s;itions are, as how they are pro|nounced; &s;ince it is the manner of the delivery, by which the audience is moved."</P>
<P>The truth of this &s;entiment of the ancients concern|ing the power and efficacy of pronunciation, might be proved from many in&s;tances; but one or two may here &s;uffice. Horten&s;ius, a cotemporary with Cicero, and while living, next to him in reputation as an orator, was highly applauded for his action. But his orations after his death, as Quintilian tells us, did not appear an&s;werable to his character; from whence he ju&s;tly concludes, there mu&s;t have been &s;omething plea&s;ing when he &s;poke, by which he gained his character, which was lo&s;t in reading them.</P>
<P>But perhaps there is &s;carcely a more con&s;iderable in|&s;tance of this than in Cicero him&s;elf. After the death of Pompey, when Ce&s;ar had gotten the government into his own hands, many of his acquaintance interce|ded with him in behalf of their relations and friends, who had been of the contrary party in the late wars. Among others, Cicero &s;olicited for his friend Ligarius; which, Tubero under&s;tanding, who owed Ligarius a grudge, opp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ed; and undertook to repre&s;ent him to Ce&s;ar as unworthy of his mercy. Ce&s;ar him&s;elf was prejudiced again&s;t Ligarius; and therefore, when the cau&s;e was to come before him, he &s;aid, "We may venture to hear Cicero di&s;play his eloquence; for I know the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r&s;on he pleads for to be an ill man, and my enemy."</P>
<P>But, however, in the cour&s;e of his oration, Cicero &s;o wrought upon his pa&s;&s;ions, that by the frequent altera|tion in his countenance, the emotions of his mind were very con&s;picuous. And when he came to touch upon the battle of Phar&s;alia, which had given Ce&s;ar the em|pire of the world, he repre&s;ented it in &s;uch a moving and lively manner, that Ce&s;ar could no longer contain him&s;elf, but was thrown into &s;uch a fit of &s;hivering, that he dropped the papers which he held in his hand. This was the more remarkable, becau&s;e Ce&s;ar was him|&s;elf
<PB N="10" REF="031827_0008_0FEEC2C49CA02BB8">
one of the greate&s;t orators of that age; knew all the arts of addre&s;s, and avenues to the pa&s;&s;ions; and con|&s;equently was better prepared to guard again&s;t them.</P>
<P>But neither his &s;kill, nor re&s;olution of mind, was of &s;ufficient force again&s;t the power of oratory; but the conqueror of the world became a conque&s;t to the charms of Cicero's eloquence; &s;o that, contrary to his inten|tion, he pardoned Ligarius. Now that oration is &s;till extant, and appears exceedingly well calculated to touch the &s;oft and tender pa&s;&s;ions and &s;prings of the &s;oul; but we believe it can &s;carcely be di&s;cernible to any, in reading it, how it &s;hould have had &s;o &s;urpri&s;ing an effect; which mu&s;t therefore have been chiefly ow|ing to the wonderful addre&s;s of the &s;peaker.</P>
<P>The more natural the pronunciation is, the more moving it will be; &s;ince the perfection of art con&s;i&s;ts in its neare&s;t re&s;emblance to nature. And therefore it is not without good rea&s;on, that the ancients make it one qualification of an orator, that he be a <HI>good</HI> man; becau&s;e a per&s;on of this character will make the cau&s;e he e&s;pou&s;es his own; and the more &s;en&s;ibly he is touched with it him&s;elf, the more natural will be his action; and, of cour&s;e, the more ea&s;ily will he affect others. Cicero &s;ays, "It is certain that truth (by which he means nature) in every thing excels imita|tion; but if that were &s;ufficient of it&s;elf in action, we &s;hould have no occa&s;ion for art."</P>
<P>In his opinion therefore (and who was ever a better judge?) art, in this ca&s;e, as well as in many others, if well managed, will a&s;&s;i&s;t and improve nature. But this is not all; for &s;ometimes we find the force of it &s;o great and powerful, that, where it is wholly counterfeit, it will for the time work the &s;ame effect as if it were founded in truth. This is well known to tho&s;e who have been conver&s;ant with the repre&s;entations of the theatre. In tragedies, though we are &s;en&s;ible that ev|ery thing we &s;ee and hear is counterfeit; yet &s;uch is the power of action, that we are oftentimes affected by it in the &s;ame manner as if it were all reality.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="031827_0009_0FEEC2C8C9375C18">Anger and re&s;entment at the appearance of cruelty, concern and &s;olicitude for di&s;tre&s;&s;ed virtue, ri&s;e in our brea&s;ts; and tears are extorted from us for oppre&s;&s;ed innocence: though at the &s;ame time, perhaps, we are ready to laugh at our&s;elves for being thus decoyed. If art then has &s;o great an influence upon us, when &s;up|ported by fancy and imagination only, how powerful mu&s;t be the effect of a ju&s;t and lively repre&s;entation of what we know to be true.</P>
<P>How agreeable it is, both to nature and rea&s;on, that a warmth of expre&s;&s;ion and vehemency of motion &s;hould ri&s;e in proportion to the importance of the &s;ubject and concern of the &s;peaker, will further appear by looking back a little into the more early and &s;imple ages of the world For the higher we go, the more we &s;hall find of both. The Romans had a very great talent this way, and the Greeks a greater. The ea&s;tern nations excelled in it, and particularly the Hebrews.</P>
<P>Nothing can equal the &s;trength and vivacity of the figures they employed in their di&s;cour&s;e, and the very actions they u&s;ed, to expre&s;s their &s;entiments; &s;uch as putting a&s;hes on their heads, and tearing their garments, and covering them&s;elves with &s;ackcloth under any deep di&s;tre&s;s and &s;orrow of mind. And hence, no doubt, aro&s;e tho&s;e &s;urpri&s;ing effects of eloquence, which we never experience now.</P>
<P>And what is &s;aid here, with re&s;pect to the action of the ea&s;tern nations, was in a good mea&s;ure cu&s;tomary among the Greeks and Romans; if not entirely of the &s;ame kind, yet perhaps as vehement and expre&s;&s;ive. They did not think language of it&s;elf &s;ufficient to ex|pre&s;s the height of their pa&s;&s;ions, unle&s;s enforced by uncommon motions and ge&s;tures. Thus, when Achil|les had driven the Trojans into their city with the greate&s;t precipitation and terror, and only Hector ven|tured to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rry without the gates to engage him, Homer repre&s;ents both king Priam and his queen under the highe&s;t con&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ernation for the danger of their &s;on. And therefore, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> order to prevail with him to come into the
<PB N="12" REF="031827_0010_0FEEC2CA5073EA00">
city and not fight with Achilles, they not only entreat him from the walls in the mo&s;t tender and moving lan|guage imaginable; but they tear off their grey locks with their hands, and adjure him to comply with their reque&s;t.</P>
<P>The poet knew very well, that no words of them|&s;elves could repre&s;ent tho&s;e agonies of mind he endeav|ored to convey, unle&s;s heightened by the idea of &s;uch actions as were expre&s;&s;ive of the deepe&s;t &s;orrow. In one of Cicero's orations, he does not &s;tick to argue in this manner with his adver&s;ary. "Would you talk thus (&s;ays he) if you were &s;erious? Would you, who are wont to di&s;play your eloquence &s;o warmly in the danger of others, act &s;o coldly in your own? Where is that concern, that ardor, which u&s;ed to extort pity even from children? Here is no emotion either of mind or body; neither the forehead &s;truck, nor the thigh; nor &s;o much as a &s;tamp of the foot. Therefore, you have been &s;o far from inflaming our minds, that you have &s;carcely kept us awake."</P>
<P>The ancients had per&s;ons, who&s;e proper bu&s;ine&s;s it was to teach them how to regulate and manage their voice; and others, who in&s;tructed them in the whole art of pronunciation, both as to their voice and ge&s;tures. The&s;e latter were generally taken from the theatre, being &s;ome eminent experienced actors. But though they made u&s;e of actors to in&s;truct their youth in form|ing their &s;peech and ge&s;tures; yet the action of an or|ator was very different from that of the theatre.</P>
<P>Cicero very plainly repre&s;ents this di&s;tinction, in the words of Cra&s;&s;us; when &s;peaking of orators, he &s;ays, "The motions of the body ought to be &s;uited to the expre&s;&s;ions, not in a theatrical way, mimicking the words by particular ge&s;ticulations; but in a manner expre&s;&s;ive of the general &s;en&s;e; with a &s;edate and manly inflection of the &s;ides; not taken from the &s;tage and actors, but from the exerci&s;e of arms and the pale&s;tra." And Quintilian &s;ays to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, "Every ge&s;ture and motion of the comedians is not to be imi|tated,
<PB N="13" REF="031827_0011_0FEEC2CE5FF2BDD0">
nor to the &s;ame degree." They thought the action of the theatre too light and extravagant for the imitation of an orator; and therefore, though they employed actors to inform young per&s;ons in the fir&s;t rudiments, yet they were afterwards &s;ent to &s;chools, de|&s;igned on purpo&s;e to teach them a decent and graceful management of their bodies.</P>
<P>Being thus far prepared, they were afterwards &s;ent to the &s;chools of the rhetoricians. And here, as their bu&s;ine&s;s was to cultivate their &s;tyle, and gain the whole art of eloquence, &s;o particularly to acquire a ju&s;t and accurate pronunciation by tho&s;e exerci&s;es, in which for that end they were con&s;tantly employed. Nor, after all this pains and indu&s;try, did they yet think them|&s;elves &s;ufficiently qualified to take upon them the char|acter of orators. But it was their con&s;tant cu&s;tom to get together &s;ome of their friends and acquaintance, who were proper judges of &s;uch performances, and declaim before them in private.</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s of the&s;e per&s;ons was to make ob&s;erva|tions both on their language and pronunciation. And they were allowed the greate&s;t freedom to take notice of any thing thought to be ami&s;s, either as to inaccuracy of method, impropriety of &s;tyle, or indecency of their voice or actions. This gave them an opportunity to correct any &s;uch defects at fir&s;t, before they became habitual. What effects might not ju&s;tly be expected from &s;uch an in&s;titution? Per&s;ons trained up in this manner, with all tho&s;e advantages, joined to a good natural genius, could not fail of making very complete orators. Though even after they came to appear in public, they did not lay a&s;ide the cu&s;tom of declaiming.</P>
<P>The influence of &s;ounds, either to rai&s;e or allay our pa&s;&s;ions, is evident from mu&s;ic. And certainly the harmony of a fine di&s;cour&s;e, well and gracefully pro|nounced, is as capable of moving us, if not in a way &s;o violent and ec&s;tatic, yet not le&s;s powerful, and more agreeable to our rational faculties. As per&s;ons are dif|ferently affected when they &s;peak, &s;o they naturally
<PB N="14" REF="031827_0012_0FEEC2CFE7C05C70">
alter the tone of their voice, though they do not attend to it. It ri&s;es, &s;inks, and has various inflections given it, according to the pre&s;ent &s;tate and di&s;po&s;ition of the mind. When the mind is calm and &s;edate, the voice is moderate and even; when the former is dejected with &s;orrow, the latter is languid; and when that is inflamed by pa&s;&s;ion, this is elevated.</P>
<P>It is the orator's bu&s;ine&s;s, therefore, to follow nature, and to endeavor that the tone of his voice appear natural and unaffected. And for this end, he mu&s;t take care to &s;uit it to the nature of the &s;ubject; but &s;till &s;o as to be always grave and decent. Some per&s;ons continue a di&s;cour&s;e in &s;uch a low and drawling manner, that they can &s;carcely be heard by their audience. Others again hurry <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in &s;o loud and boi&s;terous a manner as if they imagined their hearers were deaf. But all the mu&s;ic and harmony of voice lies between the&s;e extremes.</P>
<P>Perhaps nothing is of more importance to a &s;peaker, than a proper attention to accent, empha&s;is, and ca|dence. Every word in our language, of more than one &s;yllable, has, at lea&s;t, one accented &s;yllable. This &s;ylla|ble ought to be rightly known, and the word &s;hould be pronounced by the &s;peaker in the &s;ame manner as he would pronounce it in ordinary conver&s;ation. By em|pha&s;is, we di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e words in a &s;entence which we e&s;teem the mo&s;t important, by laying a greater &s;tre&s;s of voice upon them than we do upon the others. And it is &s;urpri&s;ing to ob&s;erve how the &s;en&s;e of a phra&s;e may be altered by varying the empha&s;is. The following example will &s;erve as an illu&s;tration.</P>
<P>This &s;hort que&s;tion, "Will you ride to town to-day?" may be under&s;tood in four different ways, and, con&s;equently, may receive four different an&s;wers, ac|cording to the placing of the empha&s;is.</P>
<P>If it be pronounced thus; Will <HI>you</HI> ride to town to-day? the an&s;wer may properly be, No; I &s;hall &s;end my &s;on. If thus; Will you <HI>rid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> to town to-day? An&s;wer, No; I intend to walk. Will you ride to
<PB N="15" REF="031827_0013_0FEEC2D16F3C8F50">
<HI>town</HI> to-day? No; I &s;hall ride into the country. Will you ride to town <HI>to-day?</HI> No; but I &s;hall to-morrow.</P>
<P>This &s;hows how nece&s;&s;ary it is that a &s;peaker &s;hould know where to place his empha&s;is. And the only rule for this is, that he &s;tudy to attain a ju&s;t conception of the force and &s;pirit of the &s;entiments which he delivers. There is as great a difference between one who lays his empha&s;is properly, and one who pays no regard to it, or places it wrong, as there is between one who plays on an in&s;trument with a ma&s;terly hand, and the mo&s;t bungling performer.</P>
<P>Cadence is the rever&s;e of empha&s;is. It is a depre&s;|&s;ion or lowering of the voice; and commonly falls up|on the la&s;t &s;yllable in a &s;entence. It is varied, how|ever, according to the &s;en&s;e. When a que&s;tion is a&s;ked, it &s;eldom falls upon the la&s;t word; and many &s;entences require no cadence at all.</P>
<P>Every per&s;on, who &s;peaks in public, &s;hould endeavor, if he can, to f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll the place where he &s;peaks. But &s;till he ought to be careful not to exceed the natural key of his voice. If he does, it will neither be &s;oft nor agreeable; but either har&s;h and rough, or too &s;hrill and &s;queaking. Be&s;ides, he will not be able to give every &s;yllable its full and di&s;tinct &s;ound; which will render what he &s;ays ob&s;cure, and difficult to be under&s;tood. He &s;hould therefore take care to keep his voice within reach, &s;o as to have it under management, that he may rai&s;e or &s;ink it, or give it any inflection he thinks prop|er; which it will not be in his power to do, if he put a force upon it, and &s;train it beyond its natural tone.</P>
<P>The like caution is to be u&s;ed again&s;t the contrary extreme, that the voice be not &s;uffered to &s;ink too low. This will give the &s;peaker pain in rai&s;ing it again to its proper pitch, and be no le&s;s offen&s;ive to the hearers. The medium between the&s;e two is a moderate and even voice. But this is not the &s;ame in all; that which is moderate in one would be high in another. Every per&s;on therefore mu&s;t regulate it by the natural key of his own voice. A calm and &s;edate voice is generally
<PB N="16" REF="031827_0014_0FEEC2D750A15EB8">
be&s;t; as a moderate &s;ound is mo&s;t plea&s;ing to the ear, if it be clear and di&s;tinct. But this equality of the voice mu&s;t al&s;o be accompanied with a variety; other|wi&s;e there can be no harmony; &s;ince all harmony con|&s;i&s;ts in variety.</P>
<P>Nothing is le&s;s plea&s;ing than a di&s;cour&s;e pronounced throughout in one continued tone of the voice, with|out any alteration. The equality, therefore, we are here &s;peaking of, admits a variety of inflections and changes within the &s;ame pitch. And when that is altered, the gradations, whether higher or lower, &s;hould be &s;o gentle and regular as to pre&s;erve a due pro|portion of the parts, and harmony of the whole; which cannot be done, when the voice is &s;uddenly varied with too great a di&s;tinction. And therefore it &s;hould move from one key to another, &s;o as rather to glide like a gentle &s;tream, than pour down like a rapid torrent, as an ingenious writer has well expre&s;&s;ed it.</P>
<P>But an affected variety, ill placed, is as di&s;agreeable to a judicious audience, as the want of it, where the &s;ubject requires it. We may find &s;ome per&s;ons, in pro|nouncing a grave and plain di&s;cour&s;e, affect as many different tones, and variations of their voice, as if they were acting a comedy; which is doubtle&s;s a very great impropriety. But the orator's province is not barely to apply to the mind, but likewi&s;e to the pa&s;&s;ions; which require a great variety of the voice, high or low, vehement or languid, according to the nature of the pa&s;&s;ions he de&s;igns to affect. So that for an orator always to u&s;e the &s;ame tone or degree of his voice, and expect to an&s;wer all his views by it, would be much the &s;ame thing as if a phy&s;ician &s;hould propo&s;e to cure all di&s;tempers by one medicine. And, as a perfect monoto|ny is always unplea&s;ant, &s;o it can never be nece&s;&s;ary in any di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>That &s;ome &s;entences ought to be pronounced fa&s;ter than others is very manife&s;t. Gay and &s;prightly ideas &s;hould not only be expre&s;&s;ed louder, but al&s;o quicker than &s;uch as are melancholy. And when we pre&s;s an
<PB N="17" REF="031827_0015_0FEEC2DA184C3AE8">
opponent, the voice &s;hould be bri&s;k. But to hurry on in a precipitant manner without pau&s;ing, till &s;topped for want of breath, is certainly a very great fault. This de&s;troys not only the nece&s;&s;ary di&s;tinction between &s;en|tence and &s;entence, but likewi&s;e between the &s;everal words of the &s;ame &s;entence; by which mean, all the grace of &s;peaking is lo&s;t, and in a great mea&s;ure, the advan|tage of hearing.</P>
<P>Young per&s;ons are very liable to this, e&s;pecially at fir&s;t &s;etting out. And it often ari&s;es from diffidence. They are jealous of their performances, and the &s;uc|ce&s;s they may have in &s;peaking, which gives them a pain till it is over; and this puts them into a hurry of mind, which incapacitates them from governing their voice, and keeping it under that due regulation which perhaps they propo&s;ed to them&s;elves before they began to &s;peak.</P>
<P>And as a precipitant and ha&s;ty pronunciation is cul|pable, &s;o likewi&s;e on the other hand, it is a fault to &s;peak too &s;low. This &s;eems to argue a heavine&s;s in the &s;peaker. And as he appears cool him&s;elf, he can never expect to warm his hearers, and excite their af|fections. When not only every word, but every &s;yl|lable is drawn out to too great a length, the ideas do not come fa&s;t enough to keep up the attention without much unea&s;ine&s;s. Now, to avoid either of the two extremes la&s;t mentioned, the voice ought to be &s;edate and di&s;tinct. And in order to render it di&s;tinct, it is nece&s;&s;ary, not only that each word and &s;yllable &s;hould have its ju&s;t and full &s;ound, both as to time and accent; but likewi&s;e that every &s;entence, and part of a &s;entence, &s;hould be &s;eparated by its proper pau&s;e.</P>
<P>This is more ea&s;y to be done in reading, from the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the points; but it is no le&s;s to be attended to in &s;peaking, if we would pronounce in a di&s;tinct and graceful manner. For every one &s;hould &s;peak in the &s;ame manner as he ought to read, if he could ar|rive at that exactne&s;s. Now the common rule given in pau&s;ing is, that we &s;top our voice at a comma till we
<PB N="18" REF="031827_0016_0FEEC2DB9F691788">
can tell one, at a &s;emicolon two, at a colon three, and at a full period four. And as the&s;e points are either accommodated to the &s;everal parts of the &s;ame &s;entence, as the fir&s;t three; or different &s;entences, as the la&s;t; this occa&s;ions the different length of the pau&s;e, by which either the dependence of what precedes upon that which follows, or its di&s;tinction from it is repre|&s;ented.</P>
<P>It is not in our power to give our&s;elves what qual|ities of the voice we plea&s;e; but only to make the be&s;t u&s;e we can of what nature has be&s;towed upon us. However, &s;everal defects of the voice are capable of being helped by care and proper means; as, on the other hand, the be&s;t voice may be greatly hurt by ill management and indi&s;cretion. Temperance is a great pre&s;ervative of the voice, and all exce&s;s is highly prej|udicial to it. The voice mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;uffer, if the organs of &s;peech have not their proper tone. A &s;trong voice is very &s;erviceable to an orator, becau&s;e, if he want &s;ome other advantages, he is, however, capable to make him&s;elf heard. And if at any time he is forced to &s;train it, he is in le&s;s danger of its failing him be|fore he has fini&s;hed his di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>But he, who has a weak voice, &s;hould be very care|ful not to &s;train it, e&s;pecially at fir&s;t. He ought to be|gin low, and ri&s;e gradually to &s;uch a pitch as the key of his voice will well carry him, without being obli|ged to &s;ink again afterwards. Frequent inflections of the voice will likewi&s;e be &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance to him. But e&s;pecially he &s;hould take care to &s;peak deliberately, and ea&s;e his voice, by allowing due time for re&s;pira|tion at all the proper pau&s;es. It is an extreme much le&s;s inconvenient for &s;uch a per&s;on rather to &s;peak too &s;low, than too fa&s;t. But this defect of a weak voice is &s;ometimes capable of being helped by the u&s;e of proper methods; as is evident from the in&s;tance of Demo&s;|thenes, before mentioned.</P>
<P>Some per&s;ons, either from want of due care in their education at fir&s;t, or from inadvertency and negligence
<PB N="19" REF="031827_0017_0FEEC2DFB48D75F0">
afterwards, run into a very irregular and confu&s;ed man|ner of expre&s;&s;ing their words; either by mi&s;placing the accent, confounding the &s;ound of the letters, or hud|dling the &s;yllables one upon another &s;o as to render what they &s;ay often unintelligible. Indeed, &s;ometimes this ari&s;es from a natural defect, as in the ca&s;e of De|mo&s;thenes; who found a method to rectify that, as well as the weakne&s;s of his voice. But in faults of this kind, which proceed from habit, doubtle&s;s the mo&s;t likely way to mend them is to &s;peak deliberately.</P>

<P>BY this is meant, a &s;uitable conformity of the mo|tions of the countenance, and &s;everal parts of the body in &s;peaking, to the &s;ubject-matter of the di&s;cour&s;e. It is not agreed among the learned, whether voice or ge&s;|ture has the greater influence upon us. But as the latter affects us by the eye, as the former does by the ear, ge&s;ture in the nature of it &s;eems to have this advan|tage, that it conveys the impre&s;&s;ion more &s;peedily to the mind; for the &s;ight is the quicke&s;t of all our &s;en&s;es. Nor is its influence le&s;s upon our pa&s;&s;ions; nay, in &s;ome in&s;tances, it appears to act more powerfully. A ca&s;t of the eye will expre&s;s de&s;ire in as moving a man|ner as the &s;ofte&s;t language; and a different motion of it, re&s;entment.</P>
<P>To wring the hands, tear the hair, or &s;trike the brea&s;t, are all &s;trong indications of &s;orrow. And he, who claps his hand to his &s;word, threws us into a greater panic than one who only threatens to kill us. Nor is it in &s;ome re&s;pects le&s;s various and exten&s;ive language. Cicero tells us, he often diverted him&s;elf by trying this with Ro&s;cius the comedian; who could expre&s;s a &s;entence as many ways by his ge&s;tures, as he him&s;elf could by words. And &s;ome dramas, called pan|tomimes, have been carried on wholly by mutes, who
<PB N="20" REF="031827_0018_0FEE92C611D4BE38">
have performed every part by ge&s;tures only, without words, in a way very intelligible.</P>
<P>But with re&s;pect to oratory, ge&s;ture may very prop|erly be called the &s;econd part of pronunciation; in which, as the voice &s;hould be &s;uited to the impre&s;&s;ions it receives from the mind, &s;o the &s;everal motions of the body ought to be accommodated to the various tones and inflections of the voice. When the voice is even and moderate, little ge&s;ture is required; and nothing is more unnatural than violent motion, in di&s;cour&s;ing upon ordinary and familiar &s;ubjects. The motions of the body &s;hould ri&s;e therefore in proportion to the vehe|mence and energy of the expre&s;&s;ion, as the natural and genuine effect of it.</P>
<P>But as ge&s;ture is very different and various as to the manner of it, which depends upon the decent conduct of &s;everal parts of the body, it will not be ami&s;s to con|&s;ider more particularly the proper management of each of tho&s;e parts. Now all ge&s;ture is either natural, or from imitation. By natural ge&s;ture, we mean &s;uch actions and motions of the body, as naturally accompany our words, as the&s;e do the impre&s;&s;ions of our mind. And the&s;e either re&s;pect the whole body, or &s;ome par|ticular part of it.</P>
<P>The &s;peaker &s;hould not long continue &s;tanding in the &s;ame po&s;ition, like a &s;tatue, but be con&s;tantly chang|ing, though the motion be very moderate. There ought to be no appearance of &s;tiffne&s;s, but a certain ea&s;e and pliablene&s;s, naturally &s;uiting it&s;elf to every expre&s;&s;ion; by which means, when a greater degree of motion is nece&s;&s;ary, it will appear le&s;s &s;udden and vehement: for as the rai&s;ing, &s;inking, and various in|flections of the voice mu&s;t be gradual, &s;o likewi&s;e &s;hould the motions of the body. It is only on &s;ome particular occa&s;ions that a ha&s;ty vehemence and impet|uo&s;ity is proper in either ca&s;e.</P>
<P>As to the &s;everal parts of the body, the head is the mo&s;t con&s;iderable. To lift it up too high has the air of arro|gance and pride; to &s;tretch it out too far, or throw it
<PB N="21" REF="031827_0019_0FEEC2E40B205F98">
back, looks clowni&s;h and unmannerly: to hang it down|wards on the brea&s;t, &s;hows an unmanly ba&s;hfulne&s;s and want of &s;pirit: and to &s;uffer it to lean on either &s;houl|der, argues both &s;loth and indolence. Wherefore, in calm and &s;edate di&s;cour&s;e, it ought to keep its natural &s;tate, an upright po&s;ture. However, it &s;hould not be long without motion, nor yet always moving; but gently turn &s;ometimes on one &s;ide, and &s;ometimes on the other, as occa&s;ion requires, that the voice may be heard by all who are pre&s;ent; and then return again to its natural po&s;ition. It &s;hould always accompany the other actions of the body, and turn on the &s;ame &s;ide with them; except when aver&s;ion to any thing is expre&s;&s;ed; which is done by &s;tretching out the right hand, and turning the head to the left.</P>
<P>But it is the countenance, that chiefly repre&s;ents both the pa&s;&s;ions and di&s;po&s;itions of the mind. By this we expre&s;s love, hatred, joy, &s;orrow, mode&s;ty, and confi|dence: by this we &s;upplicate, threaten, &s;oothe, invite, forbid, con&s;ent, or refu&s;e; and all this without &s;peaking. Nay, from hence we form a judgment not only of a per|&s;on's pre&s;ent temper, but of his capacity and natural di&s;|po&s;ition. And therefore it is common to &s;ay, &s;uch a one has a "promi&s;ing countenance," or that "he promi&s;es little by his countenance." It is true, this is no certain rule of judging; nor is it in the power of any one to alter the natural make of his countenance.</P>
<P>But the &s;everal parts of the face bear their part, and contribute to the proper and decent motion of the whole. In a calm and &s;edate di&s;cour&s;e, all the features retain their natural &s;tate and &s;ituation. In &s;orrow, the forehead and eyebrows lour, and the cheeks hang down. But in expre&s;&s;ions of joy and cheerfulne&s;s, the forehead and eyebrows are expanded, the cheeks contracted, and the corners of the mouth drawn up|wards. Anger and re&s;entment contract the forehead, draw the brows toge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">er, and thru&s;t out the lips. And terror elevates both the brows and forehead. As the&s;e
<PB N="22" REF="031827_0020_0FEEC2E8550656E8">
are the natural &s;igns of &s;uch pa&s;&s;ions, the orator &s;hould endeavor to conform to them.</P>
<P>But as the eyes are mo&s;t active and &s;ignificant, it is the advice of Cicero that the greate&s;t care &s;hould be taken in their management. And he gives this rea&s;on for it. "Becau&s;e other parts of the countenance have but few motions; whereas all the pa&s;&s;ions of the &s;oul are ex|pre&s;&s;ed in the eyes, by &s;o many different actions, which cannot po&s;&s;ibly be repre&s;ented by any ge&s;tures of the body, if the eyes are kept in a fixed po&s;ture." Com|mon experience does in a great mea&s;ure confirm the truth of this ob&s;ervation. We readily gue&s;s at a per|&s;on's intention, or how he is affected to us by his eyes. And any &s;udden change or emotion of the mind is pre&s;|ently followed by an alteration in the look.</P>
<P>In &s;peaking therefore upon plea&s;ant and delightful &s;ubjects, the eyes are bri&s;k and cheerful; as, on the contrary, they &s;ink and are languid in delivering any thing melancholy and &s;orrowful. This is &s;o agreeable to nature, that before a per&s;on &s;peaks, we are prepared with the expectation of one or the other from his dif|ferent a&s;pect. So likewi&s;e in anger, a certain vehe|mence and inten&s;ene&s;s appears in the eyes, which, for want of proper words to expre&s;s it by, we endeavor to repre&s;ent by metaphors taken from fire, the mo&s;t violent and rapid element; and &s;ay in &s;uch ca&s;es, the eyes &s;parkle, burn, or are inflamed. In expre&s;&s;ions of ha|tred or dete&s;tation, it is natural to alter the looks, either by turning the eyes a&s;ide, or downwards.</P>
<P>Indeed, the eyes are &s;ometimes turned downwards upon other occa&s;ions, as to expre&s;s mode&s;ty. And if at any time a particular object be addre&s;&s;ed, whatever it be, the eyes &s;hould be turned that way. And there|fore Philo&s;tratus very de&s;ervedly ridicules a certain rhetorician as guilty of a &s;oleci&s;m in ge&s;ture, who, upon &s;aying, O Jupiter! turned his eyes downwards; and when he &s;aid, O Earth! looked upward. A &s;taring look has the appearance of giddine&s;s and want of thought; and to contract the eyes gives &s;u&s;picion of
<PB N="23" REF="031827_0021_0FEEC2EE00211C90">
craft and de&s;ign. A fixed look may be occa&s;ioned from inten&s;ene&s;s of thought; but at the &s;ame time &s;hows a di&s;regard to the audience; and a too quick and wan|dering motion of the eyes denotes levity and wanton|ne&s;s. A gentle and moderate motion of the eyes is, therefore, in common, mo&s;t &s;uitable; always directed to &s;ome of the audience, and gradually turning from &s;ide to &s;ide with an air of re&s;pect and mode&s;ty, and looking them decently in the face, as in common di&s;|cour&s;e. Such a behaviour will of cour&s;e draw an at|tention.</P>
<P>As to the other parts of the body di&s;tinct from the head, the &s;houlders ought not to be elevated; for this is not only in it&s;elf indecent; but it likewi&s;e contracts the neck, and hinders the proper motion of the head. Nor, on the other hand, &s;hould they be drawn down and depre&s;&s;ed; becau&s;e this occa&s;ions a &s;tiffne&s;s both to the neck and the whole body. Their natural po&s;|ture therefore is be&s;t, as being mo&s;t ea&s;y and graceful. To &s;hrug the &s;houlders has an abject and &s;ervile air; and frequently to heave them upwards and downwards is a very di&s;agreeable &s;ight. A continued motion of the arms any way, is by all means to be avoided. Their action &s;hould generally be very moderate, and follow that of the hands; unle&s;s in very pathetic expre&s;&s;ions, where it may be proper to give them a more lively &s;pring.</P>
<P>Now, all bodily motion is either upward or down|ward, to the right or left, forward or backward, or el&s;e circular. The hands are employed by the orator in all the&s;e except the la&s;t. And as they ought to cor|re&s;pond with our expre&s;&s;ions, &s;o they ought to begin and end with them. In admiration, and addre&s;&s;es to heaven, they mu&s;t be elevated, but never rai&s;ed above the eyes; and in &s;peaking of things below us, they are directed downwards. Side motion &s;hould generally be|gin from the left, and terminate gently on the right. In demon&s;trating, addre&s;&s;ing, and on &s;everal other oc|ca&s;ions, they are moved forward; and in threatening,
<PB N="24" REF="031827_0022_0FEEC2F49C160870">
&s;ometimes thrown back. But when the orator &s;peaks of him&s;elf, his right hand &s;hould be gently laid on his brea&s;t.</P>
<P>The left hand &s;hould &s;eldom move alone, but ac|commodate it&s;elf to the motions of the right. In motions to the left &s;ide, the right hand &s;hould not be carried beyond the left &s;houlder. In promi&s;es, and expre&s;&s;ions of compliment, the motion of the hands &s;hould be gentle and &s;low: but in exhortations and applau&s;e, more &s;wift. The hands &s;hould generally be open; but in expre&s;&s;ions of compunction and an|ger, they may be clo&s;ed. All &s;inical and trifling actions of the fingers ought to be avoided; nor &s;hould they be &s;tretched out and expanded in a &s;tiff and rigid po&s;ture, but kept ea&s;y and pliable.</P>
<P>The ge&s;tures we have hitherto di&s;cour&s;ed of, are &s;uch as naturally accompany our expre&s;&s;ions. And we believe tho&s;e we have mentioned, if duly attended to, will be found &s;ufficient to an&s;wer all the purpo&s;es of our modern pronunciation. The other &s;ort of ge&s;tures above mentioned are &s;uch as ari&s;e from imita|tion; as where the orator de&s;cribes &s;ome action or per&s;onates another &s;peaking. But here great care is to be taken not to overact his part by running into any ludicrous or theatrical mimicry. It is &s;ufficient for him to repre&s;ent things of this nature, as may be&s;t convey the image of them in a lively manner to the minds of the hearers; without any &s;uch changes either of his actions or voice as are not &s;uitable to his own character.</P>

<HEAD>SOME PARTICULAR RULES FOR THE VOICE AND GESTURE.</HEAD>
<P>WE &s;hall begin with the parts of a di&s;cour&s;e, and treat of them in their natural order. And here the view and de&s;ign of the &s;peaker in each of them will ea&s;ily help us to &s;ee the proper manner of pronunci|ation.
<PB N="25" REF="031827_0023_0FEEC2F75E0D5FE8">
Let us &s;uppo&s;e then a per&s;on pre&s;enting him|&s;elf before an a&s;&s;embly, in order to make a di&s;cour&s;e to them. It cannot be decent immediately to begin to &s;peak &s;o &s;oon as ever he makes his appearance. He will fir&s;t &s;ettle him&s;elf, compo&s;e his countenance, and take a re&s;pectful view of his audience. This pre|pares them for &s;ilence and attention.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons commonly form &s;ome opinion of a &s;peaker from their fir&s;t view of him, which prejudices them either in his favor or otherwi&s;e, as to what he &s;ays afterwards. A grave and &s;edate a&s;pect inclines them to think him &s;erious; that he had con&s;idered his &s;ubject, and may have &s;omething to offer worth their attention. A haughty and forbidding air occa&s;ions di&s;ta&s;te, as it looks like di&s;re&s;pect. A wandering giddy countenance argues levity. A dejected drooping appearance is apt to rai&s;e contempt, unle&s;s where the &s;ubject is melan|choly. And a cheerful a&s;pect is a proper prelude to a plea&s;ant and agreeable argument.</P>
<P>To &s;peak low at fir&s;t has the appearance of mode&s;ty, and is be&s;t for the voice; which, by ri&s;ing gradually, will with more ea&s;e be carried to any pitch that may be afterwards nece&s;&s;ary, without &s;training it. How|ever, &s;ome variation of the voice is always proper to give it harmony. Nay, and &s;ometimes it is not im|proper for an orator to &s;et out with a con&s;iderable degree of warmth. We have &s;ome few in&s;tances of this in Cicero; as in his oration for Ro&s;cius Amerinus, where the heinou&s;ne&s;s of the charge could not but excite his indignation again&s;t the accu&s;ers. And &s;o likewi&s;e in that again&s;t Pi&s;o, and the two fir&s;t again&s;t Catiline, which begin in the &s;ame manner, from the re&s;entment he had conceived again&s;t their per&s;ons and conduct.</P>
<P>In the narration, the voice ought to be rai&s;ed to &s;ome|what a higher pitch. Matters of fact &s;hould be related in a very plain and di&s;tinct manner, with a proper &s;tre&s;s and empha&s;is laid upon each circum&s;tance, accompanied with a &s;uitable addre&s;s and motions of the body to engage the attention of the hearers. For there is a certain
<PB N="26" REF="031827_0024_0FEEC2FA34950B58">
grace in telling a &s;tory, by which tho&s;e who are ma&s;ters of it &s;eldom fail to recommend them&s;elves in conver|&s;ation.</P>
<P>The propo&s;ition, or &s;ubject of the di&s;cour&s;e &s;hould be delivered with a very clear and audible voice. For if this be not plainly heard, all that follows in proof of it cannot well be under&s;tood. And for the &s;ame rea&s;on, if it be divided into &s;everal parts or branches, they &s;hould each be expre&s;&s;ed very deliberately and di&s;tinctly. But as the de&s;ign here is only information, there can be little room for ge&s;ture.</P>
<P>The confirmation admits of great variety both of the voice and ge&s;ture. In rea&s;oning, the voice is quick and pungent, and &s;hould be enforced with &s;uitable actions. And as de&s;criptions likewi&s;e have often a place here, in painting out the images of things, the orator &s;hould &s;o endeavor to adapt both his voice, and the motions of his body, particularly the turn of his eyes, and action of his hands, as may be&s;t help the imagination of his hearers. Where he introduces another per&s;on &s;peak|ing, or addre&s;&s;es an ab&s;ent per&s;on, it &s;hould be with &s;ome degree of imitation. And in dialogue, the voice &s;hould alter with the parts. When he diverts from his &s;ubject by any digre&s;&s;ion, his voice &s;hould be lively and cheerful; &s;ince that is rather de&s;igned for entertain|ment than in&s;truction.</P>
<P>In confutation, the arguments of the adver&s;e party ought fir&s;t to be repeated in a plain and di&s;tinct man|ner, that the &s;peaker may not &s;eem to conceal, or avoid the force of them. Unle&s;s they appear trifling and un|worthy of a &s;erious an&s;wer; and then a facetious man|ner, both of expre&s;&s;ion and ge&s;ture, may be the mo&s;t proper way to confute them. For to attempt to an|&s;wer, in a grave and &s;erious manner, what is in it&s;elf empty and ludicrous, is apt to create a &s;u&s;picion of its having more in it than it really has.</P>
<P>But caution &s;hould be u&s;ed not to repre&s;ent any ar|gument of weight in a ludicrous way, le&s;t by &s;o doing the &s;peaker &s;hould more expo&s;e him&s;elf than his adver|&s;ary.
<PB N="27" REF="031827_0025_0FEEC2FE77A20CD8">
In the conclu&s;ion, both the voice and ge&s;ture &s;hould be bri&s;k and &s;prightly; which may &s;eem to ari&s;e from a &s;en&s;e of the &s;peaker's opinion of the good|ne&s;s of his cau&s;e, and that he has offered nothing but what is agreeable to rea&s;on and truth; as likewi&s;e from his a&s;&s;urance that the audience agree with him in the &s;ame &s;entiment. If an enumeration of the principal arguments of the di&s;cour&s;e be convenient, as it &s;ome|times is, where they are pretty numerous, or the di&s;|cour&s;e is long, they ought to be expre&s;&s;ed in the mo&s;t clear and forcible manner. And if there be an addre&s;s to the pa&s;&s;ions, both the voice and ge&s;ture mu&s;t be &s;uited to the nature of them.</P>
<P>We proceed now to the con&s;ideration of particular expre&s;&s;ions. And what we &s;hall offer here, will be in relation to &s;ingle words, &s;entences, and the pa&s;&s;ions. Even in tho&s;e &s;entences which are expre&s;&s;ed in the mo&s;t even and &s;edate manner, there is often one or more words which require an empha&s;is and di&s;tinction of the voice. Pronouns are often of this kind; as, <HI>this</HI> is the man. And &s;uch are many words that denote the circum&s;tances and qualities of things. Such as heighten or magnify the idea of the thing to which they are joined, elevate the voice; as <HI>unable, admira|ble, maje&s;tic, greatly,</HI> and the like. On the contrary, tho&s;e which le&s;&s;en the idea, or deba&s;e it, depre&s;s the voice, or at lea&s;t protract the tone: of which &s;ort are the words <HI>little, mean, poorly, contemptible,</HI> with many others.</P>
<P>Some tropes, likewi&s;e, as metaphors and verbal fig|ures, which con&s;i&s;t in the repetition of a &s;ingle word, &s;hould have a particular empha&s;is. As when Virgil &s;ays of the river Araxes, "It <HI>di&s;dained</HI> a bridge." And Ni&s;us of him&s;elf, in the &s;ame poet, "I, <HI>I</HI> am the man;" where the repeated word is loude&s;t. This di&s;tinction of words, and giving them their proper empha&s;is, does not only render the expre&s;&s;ion more clear and intelli|gible, but very much contributes to the variation of the voice, and the preventing of a monotony.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="031827_0026_0FEEC300028D8C98">In &s;entences, regard &s;hould be had to their length, and the number of their parts, in order to di&s;tingui&s;h them by proper pau&s;es. The frame and &s;tructure of the period ought likewi&s;e to be con&s;idered, that the voice may be &s;o managed as to give it the mo&s;t mu&s;ical accent. Unle&s;s there be &s;ome &s;pecial rea&s;on for the contrary, it &s;hould end louder than it begins. And this difference of tone between the end of the former &s;entence and the beginning of the next, not only helps to di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;en&s;e, but adds to the harmony of the voice.</P>
<P>In an antithe&s;is, or a &s;entence con&s;i&s;ting of oppo&s;ite parts, one contrary mu&s;t be louder than the other. As, "He is gone, but by a <HI>gainful</HI> remove, from <HI>pain|ful labor</HI> to <HI>quiet re&s;t</HI>; from <HI>unquiet de&s;ire</HI> to <HI>happy contentment:</HI> from <HI>&s;orrow</HI> to <HI>joy;</HI> and from <HI>tran&s;itory time</HI> to <HI>immortality.</HI>" In a climax or gradation, the voice &s;hould generally ri&s;e with it. Thus, "There is no enjoyment of property without government; no govern|ment without a magi&s;trate; no magi&s;trate without obe|dience; no obedience where every one acts as he plea&s;es." And &s;o in other gradations of a different form; as, "Since concord was lo&s;t, friend&s;hip was lo&s;t, fidelity was lo&s;t, liberty was lo&s;t, all was lo&s;t."</P>
<P>That the pa&s;&s;ions have each of them both a differ|ent voice and action, is evident from hence, that we know in what manner a per&s;on is affected, by the tone of his voice, though we do not under&s;tand the &s;en&s;e of what he &s;ays, or many times &s;o much as &s;ee him; and we can often make the &s;ame judgment from his coun|tenance and ge&s;tures. Love and e&s;teem are expre&s;&s;ed in a &s;mooth and cheerful tone; but anger and re&s;ent|ment, with a rough, har&s;h, and interrupted voice; for when the &s;pirits are ruffled, the organs are moved unequally. Joy rai&s;es and dilates the voice, as &s;or|row &s;inks and contracts it. Cicero takes notice of a pa&s;&s;age in an oration of Gracchus, wherein he bewails the death of his brother, who was killed by Scipio, which in his time was thought very moving: "Unhap|py
<PB N="29" REF="031827_0027_0FEEC301892BDEB0">
man (&s;ays he,) whither &s;hall I betake my&s;elf? Where &s;hall I go? Into the capitol? that flows with my broth|er's blood. Shall I go home, and behold my unhappy mother all in tears and de&s;pair?"</P>
<P>Though Gracchus had a very ill de&s;ign in that &s;peech, and his view was to excite the populace again&s;t their governors, yet (as Cicero tells us) when he came to this pa&s;&s;age, he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in &s;uch moving accents and ge&s;tures that he extorted tears even from his ene|mies. Fear occa&s;ions a tremor and he&s;itation of the voice, and a&s;&s;urance gives it &s;trength and firmne&s;s. Admiration elevates the voice, and &s;hould be expre&s;&s;ed with pomp and magnificence. "O &s;urpri&s;ing clemency, worthy of the highe&s;t prai&s;e and greate&s;t encomiums, and fit to be perpetuated in la&s;ting monuments!" This is Cicero's compliment to Ce&s;ar, when he thought it for his purpo&s;e. And oftentimes this pa&s;&s;ion is accompanied with an elevation both of the eyes and hands. On the contrary, contempt &s;inks and protracts the voice.</P>
<P>All exclamations &s;hould be violent. When we ad|dre&s;s inanimate things, the voice &s;hould be higher th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n when animated beings; and appeals to heaven mu&s;t be made in a loftier tone than tho&s;e to men. The&s;e few hints for expre&s;&s;ing the principal pa&s;&s;ions may, if duly attended to, &s;uffice to direct our practice in others. Though after all, it is impo&s;&s;ible to gain a ju&s;t and decent pronunciation of voice and ge&s;ture merely from rules, without practice and an imitation of the be&s;t examples: which &s;hows the wi&s;dom of the ancients, in training up their youth to it, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of ma&s;ters, to form both their &s;peech and actions. But here, as has been before ob&s;erved, great caution &s;hould be u&s;ed in directing our choice of an example. An affected imitation of others, in pronunciation or ge&s;ture, e&s;pecially of &s;tage-players, who&s;e preten&s;ions to litera|ture are &s;eldom con&s;iderable, and who are generally too fond of <HI>&s;ingularity,</HI> ought to be carefully avoided. For nothing can appear more di&s;gu&s;ting to per&s;ons of di&s;cernment than affectation.</P>

<HEAD>EXTRACT FROM AN ORATION ON ELO|QUENCE, PRONOUNCED AT HARVARD UNIVER|SITY, ON COMMENCEMENT DAY, 1794.</HEAD>
<P>THE excellence, utility, and importance of ELO|QUENCE; its origin, progre&s;s, and pre&s;ent &s;tate; and its &s;uperior claim to the particular attention of Columbia's free-born &s;ons, will exerci&s;e for a few mo|ments the patience of this learned, polite, and re&s;pected a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>Speech and rea&s;on are the characteri&s;tics, the glory, and the happine&s;s of man. The&s;e are the pillars which &s;upport the fair fabric of eloquence; the foundation, up|on which is erected the mo&s;t magnificent edifice, that genius could de&s;ign, or art con&s;truct. To cultivate elo|quence, then, is to improve the noble&s;t faculties of our nature, the riche&s;t talents with which we are intru&s;ted. A more convincing proof of the dignity and importance of our &s;ubject need not, cannot be advanced.</P>
<P>The benevolent de&s;ign and the beneficial effects of eloquence, evince its great &s;uperiority over every other art, which ever exerci&s;ed the ingenuity of man. To in&s;truct, to per&s;uade, to plea&s;e; the&s;e are its objects.
<PB N="31" REF="031827_0029_0FEEC3097980B400">
To &s;catter the clouds of ignorance and error from the atmo&s;phere of rea&s;on; to remove the film of preju|dice from the mental eye; and thus to irradiate the benighted mind with the cheering beams of truth, is at once the bu&s;ine&s;s and the glory of eloquence.</P>
<P>To promote the innocent and refined plea&s;ures of the fancy and intellect; to &s;trip the mon&s;ter vice of all his borrowed charms, and expo&s;e to view his native defor|mity; to di&s;play the re&s;i&s;tle&s;s attractions of virtue; and, in one word, to rou&s;e to action all the latent energies of man, in the proper and ardent pur&s;uit of the great end of his exi&s;tence, is the orator's plea&s;ing, benevolent, &s;ublime employment.</P>
<P>Nor let it be objected, that eloquence &s;ometimes im|pedes the cour&s;e of ju&s;tice, and &s;creens the guilty from the puni&s;hment due to their crimes. Is there any thing which is not obnoxious to abu&s;e? Even the benign religion of the Prince of Peace has been made the unwilling in&s;trument of the greate&s;t calamities ever experienced by man. The greater the benefits which naturally re&s;ult from any thing, the more pernicious are its effects, when diverted from its proper cour&s;e. This objection to eloquence is therefore its highe&s;t eulogium.</P>
<P>The orator does not &s;ucceed, as &s;ome would in&s;in|uate, by dazzling the eye of rea&s;on with the illu&s;ive glare of his rhetorical art, nor, by &s;ilencing her &s;till &s;mall voice in the thunder of his declamation; for to her impartial tribunal he refers the truth and propriety of whatever he a&s;&s;erts or propo&s;es. After fairly con|vincing the under&s;tanding, he may, without the impu|tation of di&s;ingenuou&s;ne&s;s, proceed to addre&s;s the fancy and the pa&s;&s;ions. In this way he will more effectually transfu&s;e into his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">earers his own &s;entiments, and make every &s;pring in the human machine co-operate in the production of the de&s;ired effect.</P>
<P>The a&s;toni&s;hing powers of eloquence are well known, at lea&s;t to tho&s;e who are conver&s;ant in ancient hi&s;tory. Like a re&s;i&s;tle&s;s torrent, it bears down every ob&s;tacle, and turns even the current of oppo&s;ing ignorance and
<PB N="32" REF="031827_0030_0FEEC313C4C19EF0">
prejudice into the de&s;ired channel of active and zealous compliance. It is indi&s;putably the mo&s;t potent art with|in the compa&s;s of human acquirement. An Alexander and a Ce&s;ar could conquer a world; but to overcome the pa&s;&s;ions, to &s;ubdue the wills, and to command at plea&s;ure the inclinations of men, can be effected only by the all-powerful charm of enrapturing eloquence.</P>
<P>Though it be more than probable, that oratory was known and cultivated in &s;ome degree in tho&s;e ea&s;tern nations, where &s;cience fir&s;t began to dawn upon the world&punc; yet it was not till Greece became civilized and formed into di&s;tinct governments, that it made its appear|ance in its native, peerle&s;s maje&s;ty. Here we may fix the era of eloquence; here was its morn; here its meridian too; for here it &s;hone with &s;plendor never &s;ince &s;urpa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>It is a common and a ju&s;t remark, that eloquence can flouri&s;h only in the &s;oil of liberty. Athens was a republic, where the affairs of &s;tate were tran&s;acted in the a&s;&s;embly of the whole people. This afforded to eloquence a field too fertile to remain long uncultiva|ted by the ingenious Athenians. Orators &s;oon made their appearance, who did honor to language, to Greece, to humanity.</P>
<P>But though the names of many have been tran&s;|mitted to us, who&s;e genius and eloquence demand our veneration and applau&s;e; yet, like &s;tars when the &s;un appears, they are lo&s;t in the &s;uperior blaze of the in|comparable Demo&s;thenes. His &s;tory is well known; and his example affords the greate&s;t encouragement to &s;tudents in eloquence; as it proves, that, by art, almo&s;t in defiance of nature, a man may attain &s;uch excellence in oratory, as &s;hall &s;tamp his name with the &s;eal of im|mortality. Demo&s;thenes and the liberty of Greece to|gether expired; and from this period we hear very little more of Grecian eloquence.</P>
<P>Let us now direct our attention to that other gar|den of eloquence, the Roman commonwealth. Here, as in Greece, a free government opened the li&s;t to &s;uch as wi&s;hed to di&s;pute the palm in oratory. Numbers
<PB N="33" REF="031827_0031_0FEEC318EDFE6DE8">
advance, and contend manfully for the prize. But their glory is &s;oon to fade; for Cicero appears; Cicero, another name for eloquence it&s;elf. It is needle&s; to enlarge on his character as an orator. Suffice it to &s;ay, that if we ran&s;ack the hi&s;tories of the world to find a rival for Demo&s;thenes, Cicero alone can be found capable of &s;upporting a claim to that di&s;tingui&s;hed honor.</P>
<P>And when did Greece or Rome pre&s;ent a fairer field for eloquence, than that which now invites the culture of the enlightened citizens of Columbia? We live in a republic, the orator's natal &s;oil; we enjoy as much liberty, as is con&s;i&s;tent with the nature of man; we po&s;&s;e&s;s as a nation all the advantages which climate, &s;oil, and &s;ituation can be&s;tow; and nothing but <HI>real merit</HI> is here required as a qualification for the mo&s;t dignified offices of &s;tate. Never had eloquence more ample &s;cope.</P>
<P>And &s;hall we re&s;t &s;atisfied with only admiring, or at mo&s;t with following at an awful di&s;tance the mo&s;t illu&s;trious orators of Greece and Rome? Shall every other u&s;eful and ornamental art &s;peed &s;wiftly towards perfection, while oratory, that mo&s;t &s;ublime of all arts; that art, which could render one man more dreadful to a tyrant, than ho&s;tile fleets and armies, is almo&s;t forgotten? It mu&s;t not, cannot be. That refinement of ta&s;te, that laudable ambition to excel in every thing which does honor to humanity, which di&s;tingui&s;hes the Americans, and their free and popular government, are &s;o many &s;prings, which, though not in&s;tantane|ous in their operation, cannot fail in time to rai&s;e Columbian eloquence "above all Greek, above all Roman fame."</P>
<P>With plea&s;ure we de&s;cry the dawning of that bright day of eloquence, which we have anticipated. The grand council of our nation has already evinced, that in this re&s;pect, as in all others, our republic ac|knowledges no exi&s;ting &s;uperior. And we tru&s;t, that, as our &s;acred teachers make it their con&s;tant endeavor

to imitate the great learning, the exemplary virtue, the exalted piety, and the exten&s;ive u&s;efulne&s;s of the great apo&s;tle of the Gentiles, they will not fail to re|&s;emble him in that commanding, that heavenly elo|quence, which made an avaricious, an unbeliving Fe|lix tremble.</P>
<P>May Columbia always afford more than one De|mo&s;thenes, to &s;upport the &s;acred cau&s;e of freedom, and to thunder terror in the ears of every tran&s;at|lantic Philip. May more than Ciceronian eloquence be ever ready to plead for injured innocence, and &s;uffering virtue. Warned by the fate of her prede|ce&s;&s;ors, may &s;he e&s;cape tho&s;e quick&s;ands of vice, which have ever proved the bane of empire. May her glory and her felicity increa&s;e with each revolving year, till the la&s;t trump &s;hall announce the cata&s;trophe of nature, and time &s;hall immerge in the ocean of eternity.</P>

<P>AMONG the vici&s;&s;itudes incident to life, no event could have filled me with greater anxieties than that of which the notification was tran&s;mitted by your order, and received on the 14th day of the pre&s;ent month. On the one hand, I was &s;ummoned by my country, who&s;e voice I can never hear but with vene|ration and love, from a retreat which I had cho&s;en with the fonde&s;t predilection, and, in my flattering hopes, with an immutable deci&s;ion, as the a&s;ylum of my declining years. A retreat which was rendered every day more nece&s;&s;ary as well as more dear to me, by the addition of habit to inclination, and of frequent interruptions in my health to the gradual wa&s;te com|mitted on it by time.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="031827_0033_0FEEC31F204D64D8">On the other hand, the magnitude and difficulty of the tru&s;t, to which the voice of my country called me, being &s;ufficient to awaken in the wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t expe|rienced of her citizens, a di&s;tru&s;tful &s;crutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with de&s;pon|dence one, who inheriting inferior endowments from nature, and unpracti&s;ed in the duties of civil admini&s;|tration, ought to be peculiarly con&s;cious of his own deficiencies.</P>
<P>In this conflict of emotions, all I dare aver is, that it has been my faithful &s;tudy to collect my duty from a ju&s;t appreciation of every circum&s;tance by which it might be affected. All I dare hope is, that if, in executing this ta&s;k I have been too much &s;wayed by a grateful remembrance of former in&s;tances, or by an affectionate &s;en&s;ibility to this tran&s;cendent proof of the confidence of my fellow-citizens, and have thence too little con|&s;ulted my incapacity as well as di&s;inclination for the weighty and untried cares before me, my error will be palliated by the motives which mi&s;led me; and its con|&s;equences be judged by my country, with &s;ome &s;hare of the partiality in which they originated.</P>
<P>Such being the impre&s;&s;ions under which I have, in obedience to the public &s;ummons, repaired to the pre&s;|ent &s;tation, it would be peculiarly improper to omit in this fir&s;t official act, my &s;ervent &s;upplications to that Almighty Being, who rules over the univer&s;e, who pre&s;ides in the councils of nations, and who&s;e provi|dential aids can &s;upply every human defect, that his benediction may con&s;ecrate to the liberties and happi|ne&s;s of the people of the United States, a government in&s;tituted by them&s;elves for the&s;e e&s;&s;ential purpo&s;es; and may enable every in&s;trument employed in its ad|mini&s;tration, to execute with &s;ucce&s;s, the &s;unctions al|lotted to his charge. In tendering this homage to the great Author of every public and private good, I a&s;|&s;ure my&s;elf that it expre&s;&s;es your &s;entiments not le&s;s than my own; nor tho&s;e of my fellow-citizens at large, le&s;s than either.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="031827_0034_0FEEC321F7C16830">No people can be bound to acknowledge and adore the invi&s;ible hand, which conducts the affairs of men, more than the people of the United States. Every &s;tep, by which they have advanced to the character of an independent nation, &s;eems to have been di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;ome token of providential agency. And in the important revolution ju&s;t accompli&s;hed in the &s;y&s;tem of their united government, the tranquil deliberations and voluntary con&s;ent of &s;o many di&s;tinct communities, from which the event has re&s;ulted, cannot be com|pared with the means by which mo&s;t governments have been e&s;tabli&s;hed, without &s;ome return of pious grati|tude with a humble anticipation of the future ble&s;&s;ings which the pa&s;t &s;eem to pre&s;age. The&s;e reflections, ari&s;ing out of the pre&s;ent cri&s;is, have forced them&s;elves too &s;trongly on my mind to be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. You will join with me, I tru&s;t, in thinking that there are none, under the influence of which, the proceedings of a new and free government can more au&s;piciou&s;ly com|mence.</P>

<HEAD>SPEECH OF PAULUS EMILIUS TO THE ROMAN PEOPLE, AS HE WAS ABOUT TAKING THE COM|MAND OF THEIR ARMY.</HEAD>
<P>YOU &s;eem to me, Romans, to have expre&s;&s;ed more joy when Macedonia fell to my lot, than when I was elected con&s;ul, or entered upon that office. And to me your joy &s;eemed to be occa&s;ioned by the hopes you conceived, that I &s;hould put an end, wor|thy of the grandeur and reputation of the Roman people, to a war, which, in your opinion, has already been of too long continuance. I have rea&s;on to believe, that the &s;ame gods, who have occa&s;ioned Macedonia to fall to my lot, will al&s;o a&s;&s;i&s;t me with their protec|tion in conducting and terminating this war &s;ucce&s;s|fully. But of this, I may venture to a&s;&s;ure you, that
<PB N="37" REF="031827_0035_0FEEC32382A68B08">
I &s;hall do my utmo&s;t not to fall &s;hort of your expecta|tions.</P>
<P>The &s;enate has wi&s;ely regulated every thing nece&s;|&s;ary in the expedition I am charged with; and, as I am ordered to &s;et out immediately, I &s;hall m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ke no delay; and I know that my colleague Caius Licinius, out of his great zeal for the public &s;ervice, will rai&s;e and march off the troops appointed for me, with as much ardor and expedition, as if they were for him|&s;elf. I &s;hall take care to tran&s;mit to you, as well as to the &s;enate, an exact account of all that pa&s;&s;es; and you may rely upon the certainty and truth of my let|ters. But I beg of you, as a great favor, that you will not give credit to, or lay any weight, out of credulity, upon the light reports, which are frequently &s;pread abroad without any author.</P>
<P>I perceive well, that in this war, more than in any other, whatever re&s;olution people may form to obviate the&s;e rumors, they will not fail to make impre&s;&s;ion, and in&s;pire I know not what di&s;couragement. There are tho&s;e, who in company, and even at table, com|mand armies, make di&s;po&s;itions, and pre&s;cribe all the operations of the campaign. They know better than we, where we &s;hould encamp, and what po&s;ts it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary for us to &s;eize; at what time, and by what de|file we ought to enter Macedonia; where it is proper to have magazines; from whence, either by &s;ea or land, we are to bring provi&s;ions; when we are to fight the enemy, and when lie &s;till.</P>
<P>They not only pre&s;cribe what is be&s;t to do; but for deviating ever &s;o little from their plans, they make it a crime in their con&s;ul, and cite him before their tribunal. But know, Romans, this is of very bad ef|fect with your generals. All have not the re&s;olution and con&s;tancy of Fabius, to de&s;pi&s;e impertinent reports. He could choo&s;e rather to &s;uffer the people, upon &s;uch unhappy rumors, to invade his authority, than to ruin affairs in order to pre&s;erve their opinion, and an empty name.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="031827_0036_0FEEC3250A3AF138">I am far from believing, that generals &s;tand in no need of advice: I think, on the contrary, that who|ever would conduct every thing alone, upon his own opinion, and without coun&s;el, &s;hows more pre&s;umption than prudence. But &s;ome may a&s;k, How then &s;hall we act rea&s;onably? I an&s;wer, by not &s;uffering any per&s;ons to obtrude their advice upon your generals, but &s;uch as are, in the fir&s;t place, ver&s;ed in the art of war, and have learned from experience what it is to command; and in the &s;econd place, who are upon the &s;pot; who know the enemy; are witne&s;&s;es in per&s;on to all that pa&s;&s;es; and &s;harers with us in all dangers.</P>
<P>If there be any one, who conceives him&s;elf capable of a&s;&s;i&s;ting me with his coun&s;els in the war you have charged me with, let him not refu&s;e to do the republic that &s;ervice; but let him go with me into Macedo|nia. Ships, hor&s;es, tents, provi&s;ions, &s;hall all be pro|vided for him at my charge. But if he will not take &s;o much trouble, and prefers the tranquillity of the city to the dangers and fatigues of the field, let him not take upon him to hold the helm, and continue idle in the port. The city of it&s;elf &s;upplies &s;ufficient mat|ter of di&s;cour&s;e on other &s;ubjects; but as for the&s;e, let it be &s;ilent upon them; and know, that we &s;hall pay no regard to any coun&s;els, but &s;uch as &s;hall be given us in the camp it&s;elf.</P>

<HEAD>EXHORTATION ON TEMPERANCE IN PLEASURE.</HEAD>
<P>LET me particularly exhort youth to temperance in plea&s;ure. Let me admoni&s;h them, to beware of that rock on which thou&s;ands, from race to race, continue to &s;plit. The love of plea&s;ure, natural to man in every period of his life, glows at this age with exce&s;&s;ive ardor. Novelty adds fre&s;h charms, as yet, to every gratification. The world appears to
<PB N="39" REF="031827_0037_0FEEC32690339158">
&s;pread a continual fea&s;t; and health, vigor, and high &s;pirits, invite them to partake of it without re&s;traint. In vain we warn them of latent dangers. Religion is accu&s;ed of in&s;ufferable &s;everity, in prohibiting enjoy|ment: and the old, when they offer their admonitions, are upbraided with having forgotten that they once were young.</P>
<P>And yet, my friends, to what do the re&s;traints of religion, and the coun&s;els of age, with re&s;pect to plea&s;ure, amount? They may all be compri&s;ed in few words, not to hurt your&s;elves, and not to hurt others, by your pur&s;uit of plea&s;ure. Within the&s;e bounds, plea&s;ure is lawful; beyond them, it becomes criminal, becau&s;e it is ruinous. Are the&s;e re&s;traints any other, than what a wi&s;e man would choo&s;e to impo&s;e on him&s;elf? We call you not to renounce plea&s;ure, but to enjoy it in &s;afety. In&s;tead of abridging it, we ex|hort you to pur&s;ue it on an exten&s;ive plan. We pro|po&s;e mea&s;ures for &s;ecuring its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and for pro|longing its duration.</P>
<P>Con&s;ult your whole nature. Con&s;ider your&s;elves not only as &s;en&s;itive, but as rational beings; not only as rational, but &s;ocial; not only as &s;ocial, but immortal. Whatever violates your nature, in any of the&s;e re|&s;pects, cannot afford true plea&s;ure; any more than that which undermines an e&s;&s;ential part of the vital &s;y&s;tem can promote health. For the truth of this con|clu&s;ion, we appeal, not merely to the authority of re|ligion, nor to the te&s;timony of the aged, but to your|&s;elves and your own experience. We a&s;k, whether you have not found, that in a cour&s;e of criminal exce&s;s, your plea&s;ure was more than compen&s;ated by &s;ucceed|ing pain? Whether, if not from every particular in|&s;tance, yet from every habit, at lea&s;t, of unlawful gratification, there did not &s;pring &s;ome thorn to wound you; there did not ari&s;e &s;ome con&s;equence to make you repent of it in the i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ue.</P>
<P>"How long then, ye &s;imple ones! will ye love &s;im|plicity?" How long repeat the &s;ame round of perni|cious
<PB N="40" REF="031827_0038_0FEEC32818435590">
folly, and tamely expo&s;e your&s;elves to be caught in the &s;ame &s;nare? If you have any con&s;ideration, or any firmne&s;s left, avoid temptations, for which you have found your&s;elves unequal, with as much care as you would &s;hun pe&s;tilential infection. Break off all connexions with the loo&s;e and profligate. "When &s;inners entice thee, con&s;ent thou not. Look not on the wine when it is red, when it giveth its color in the cup; for at the la&s;t, it biteth like a &s;erpent, and &s;ting|eth like an adder. Remove thy way from the &s;trange woman, and come not near the door of her hou&s;e. Let not thine heart decline to her ways; for her hou&s;e is the way to hell. Thou goe&s;t after her as a bird ha&s;|teneth to the &s;nare, and knoweth not that it is for his life."</P>
<P>By the&s;e unhappy exce&s;&s;es of irregular plea&s;ure in youth, how many amiable di&s;po&s;itions are corrupted or de&s;troyed! How many ri&s;ing capacities and powers are &s;uppre&s;&s;ed! How many flattering hopes of parents and friends are totally extingui&s;hed! Who but mu&s;t drop a tear over human nature, when he beholds that morning which aro&s;e &s;o bright, overca&s;t with &s;uch untimely darkne&s;s; that good humor which once capti|vated all hearts; that vivacity which &s;parkled in every company; tho&s;e abilities which were fitted for adorn|ing the highe&s;t &s;tation, all &s;acrificed at the &s;hrine of low &s;en&s;uality; and one, who was formed for running the fair career of life in the mid&s;t of public e&s;teem, cut off by his vices at the beginning of his cour&s;e, or &s;unk, for the whole of it, into in&s;ignificancy and contempt! The&s;e, O &s;inful Plea&s;ure! are thy trophies. It is thus, that, co-operating with the foe of God and man, thou degrade&s;t human nature, and bla&s;te&s;t the opening pro&s;|pects of human felicity.</P>

<HEAD>JUDAH'S PLEA FOR HIS BROTHER BENJAMIN, BEFORE JOSEPH IN EGYPT.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN we appeared before you, Sir, the fir&s;t time, we an&s;wered without re&s;erve, and ac|cording to the &s;tricte&s;t truth, all the que&s;tions which you were plea&s;ed to put to us concerning our family. We acquainted you, that we had a father, heavily la|den with years, but &s;till more heavily with misfortunes; a father, who&s;e whole life had been one continued &s;trug|gle with adver&s;ity. We added that we had a brother pe|culiarly dear to him, as the children born towards the end of their life generally are to old men, and who is the only one remaining of his mother; his brother hav|ing come in early youth to a mo&s;t tragical end.</P>
<P>You commanded us, as the proof of our veracity and innocence, to bring that brother unto you; and your command was delivered with &s;uch threatenings, that the terror of them accompanied us all the way back to our country, and embittered the remainder of our jour|ney. We reported every thing minutely to our father, as you directed us. Re&s;olutely and long, he refu&s;ed to intru&s;t us with the care of that child. Love &s;ugge&s;ted a thou&s;and cau&s;es of apprehen&s;ion upon his account. He loaded us with the bittere&s;t reproaches for having declared that we had another brother.</P>
<P>Subdued by the famine, he at length reluctantly con|&s;ented; and putting his beloved &s;on, this unhappy youth, into our hands, conjured us by every dear, every awful name, to guard with tenderne&s;s his pre|cious life; and as we would not &s;ee him expire before our eyes in angui&s;h and de&s;pair, to bring him back in &s;afety. He parted with him as with a limb torn from his own body; and in an agony of grief inexpre&s;&s;ible, deplored the dreadful nece&s;&s;ity which &s;eparated him from a &s;on, on whom all the happine&s;s of his life de|pended.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="031827_0040_0FEEC32DAACD32F8">How then can we appear before a father of &s;uch delicate &s;en&s;ibility? With what eyes &s;hall we dare to look upon him, unle&s;s we carry back with us this &s;on of his right hand, this &s;taff of his old age, whom, alas! you have condemned to &s;lavery? The good old man will expire in horrors dreadful to nature, as &s;oon as he &s;hall find that his &s;on is not with us. Our ene|mies will in&s;ult over us under the&s;e misfortunes, and treat us as the mo&s;t infamous of parricides.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t appear to the world, and to my&s;elf, as the perpetrato<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of that mo&s;t horrid of crimes, the murder of a father; for it was I who mo&s;t urgently pre&s;&s;ed my father to yield.

Have pity, I be&s;eech you, on the deplorable condition of an old man, &s;trip|ped of his la&s;t comfort; and who&s;e mi&s;ery will be ag|gravated by reflecting that he fore&s;aw its approach, and yet wanted re&s;olution to prevent it.</P>
<P>If your ju&s;t indignation mu&s;t needs have a &s;acrifice, here I am ready, at the price of my liberty or of my life, to expiate this young man's guilt, and to purcha&s;e his relea&s;e!

<HEAD>EXTRACT FROM THE PLEA OF THOMAS MUIR, ESQ. AT HIS CELEBRATED TRIAL IN SCOTLAND.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS is now perhaps the la&s;t time that I &s;hall ad|dre&s;s my country. I have explored the tenor of my pa&s;t life. Nothing &s;hall tear from me the rec|ord of my departed days. The enemies of reform have &s;crutinized, in a manner hitherto unexampled in Scot|land, every action I may have performed, every word I may have uttered. Of crimes, mo&s;t foul and horri|ble, have I been accu&s;ed: of attempting to rear the &s;tandard of civil war; to plunge this land in blood, and to cover it with de&s;olation. At every &s;tep, as the evi|dence of the crown advanced, my innocency has bright|ened. So far from inflaming the minds of men to &s;e|dition and outrage, all the witne&s;&s;es have concurred, that my only anxiety was, to impre&s;s upon them the nece&s;&s;ity of peace, of good order, and of good morals.</P>
<P>What then has been my crime? Not the lending to a relation a copy of Mr. Paine's Works; not the giving away to another a few numbers of an innocent and con&s;titutional publication; but for having dared to be, according to the mea&s;ure of my feeble abilities, a &s;tren|uous and active advocate for an equal repre&s;entation of the PEOPLE, in the HOUSE OF THE PEOPLE; for having dared to attempt to accompli&s;h a mea&s;ure, by legal means, which was to dimini&s;h the weight of their taxes, and to put an end to the profu&s;ion of their blood.</P>
<P>From my infancy to this moment, I have devoted my&s;elf to the cau&s;e of the PEOPLE. It is a good cau&s;e. It will ultimately prevail. It will finally tri|umph. Say then openly, in your verdict, if you do con|demn me, which I pre&s;ume you will not, that it is for my attachment to this cau&s;e alone, and not for tho&s;e vain and wretched pretexts &s;tated in the indictment, intended on|ly to color and di&s;gui&s;e the real motives of my accu&s;a|tion.
<PB N="44" REF="031827_0042_0FEEC32F3486F5E0">
The time will come, when men mu&s;t &s;tand or fall by their actions; when all human pageantry &s;hall cea&s;e; when the hearts of all &s;hall be laid open to view.</P>

<P>As for me, I am carele&s;s and indifferent to my fate. I can look danger, and I can look death in the face; for I am &s;hielded by the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of my own recti|tude.

<HEAD>ON THE STARRY HEAVENS.</HEAD>
<P>TO us who dwell on its &s;urface, the earth is by far the mo&s;t exten&s;ive orb that our eyes can any where behold. It is al&s;o clothed with verdure; di&s;|tingui&s;hed by trees; and adorned with a variety of beautiful decorations. Whereas, to a &s;pectator placed on one of the planets, it wears a uniform a&s;pect; looks all luminous, and no larger than a &s;pot. To beings who dwell at &s;till greater di&s;tances, it entirely di&s;|appears.</P>
<P>That which we call, alternately, the morning and evening &s;tar; as in one part of her orbit, &s;he rides foremo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t in the proce&s;&s;ion of night; in the other, u&s;h|ers in, and anticipates the dawn, is a planetary world; which&punc; with the five others, that &s;o wonderfully vary their my&s;tic dance, are in them&s;elves dark bodies, and &s;hine only by reflection; have fields, and &s;eas, and &s;kies of their own; are furni&s;hed with all accommodations

for animal &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and are &s;uppo&s;ed to be abodes of intellectual life. All which, together with this our earthly habitation, are dependent on that grand di&s;|pen&s;er of divine munificence, the &s;un; receive their light from the di&s;tribution of his rays; derive their com|fort from his divine agency.</P>
<P>The &s;un is the great axle of heaven, about which, the globe we inhabit, and other more &s;pacious orbs, wheel their &s;tated cour&s;es. The &s;un, though &s;eem|ingly &s;maller than the dial it illuminates, is abundantly larger than this whole earth; on which &s;o many lofty mountains ri&s;e, and &s;uch va&s;t oceans roll. A line, ex|tending through the centre of that re&s;plendent orb, would mea&s;ure more than eight hundred thou&s;and miles. A girdle, formed to &s;urround it, would require a length of millions. Were its &s;olid contents to be e&s;|timated, the account would overpower our under&s;tand|ing, and be almo&s;t beyond the power of language to expre&s;s.</P>
<P>Are we &s;tartled at the&s;e reports of a&s;tronomy? Are we ready to cry out in a tran&s;port of &s;urpri&s;e, How mighty is the Being, who kindled &s;uch a prodigious fire, and who keeps alive, from age to age, &s;uch an enormous ma&s;s of flame! Let us attend our philo&s;ophic guides, and we &s;hall be brought acquainted with &s;pec|ulations more enlarged, and more amazing.</P>
<P>This &s;un, with all attendant planets, is but a very little part of the grand machine of the univer&s;e. Ev|ery &s;tar, though in appearance, no bigger than the dia|mond that glitters on a lady's ring, is really a mighty globe; like the &s;un in &s;ize, and in glory; no le&s;s &s;pa|cious; no le&s;s luminous than the radiant &s;ource of our day. So that every &s;tar is not barely a world, but the centre of a magnificent &s;y&s;tem; has a retinue of worlds, irradiated by its beams, and revolving round its attrac|tive influence. All which are lo&s;t to our &s;ight in un|mea&s;urable wilds of ether.</P>
<P>That the &s;tars appear like &s;o many diminutive, and &s;carcely di&s;tingui&s;hable points, is owing to their im|men&s;e,
<PB N="46" REF="031827_0044_0FEEC3350445F2C8">
and inconceivable di&s;tance. Such a di&s;tance, that a cannon ball, could it continue its impetuous flight, with unabating rapidity, would not reach the neare&s;t of tho&s;e twinkling luminaries for more than five hundred thou&s;and years!</P>
<P>Can any thing be more wonderful than the&s;e ob&s;er|vations? Yes; there are truths far more &s;tupendous; there are &s;cenes far more exten&s;ive. As there is no end of the Almighty Maker's greatne&s;s, &s;o no imagina|tion can &s;et limits to his creating hand. Could you &s;oar beyond the moon, and pa&s;s through all the planetary choir; could you wing your way to the highe&s;t appar|ent &s;tar, and take your &s;tand on one of tho&s;e lofty pin|nacles of heaven, you would there &s;ee other &s;kies ex|panded; another &s;un, di&s;tributing his inexhau&s;tible beams by day; other &s;tars which gild the horrors of the alternate night; and other, perhaps nobler &s;y&s;tems, e&s;tabli&s;hed in unknown profu&s;ion, through the bound|le&s;s dimen&s;ions of &s;pace. Nor do the dominions of the univer&s;al Sovereign terminate there. Even at the end of this va&s;t tour, you would find your&s;elf advanced no further than the &s;uburbs of creation; arrived only at the frontiers of the great JEHOVAH's kingdom.</P>

<HEAD>EXTRACT FROM CATO'S SPEECH BEFORE THE ROMAN SENATE, AFTER THE CONSPIRACY OF CATILINE.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE often &s;poken before you, Fathers, with &s;ome extent, to complain of luxury and the greedine&s;s for money, the twin vices of our corrupt citizens; and have thereby drawn upon my&s;elf abun|dance of enemies. As I never &s;pared any fault in my&s;elf, I was not ea&s;ily inclined to favor the criminal exce&s;&s;es of others.</P>
<P>But though you paid little regard to my remon|&s;trances, the Commonwealth has &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ted by its own &s;trength; has borne it&s;elf up, notwith&s;tanding your neglect. It is not now the &s;ame. Our manners, good or bad, are not the que&s;tion, nor to pre&s;erve the greatne&s;s and lu&s;tre of the Roman empire; but to re&s;olve whether all we po&s;&s;e&s;s and govern, well or ill, &s;hall continue ours, or be transferred with our&s;elves to enemies.</P>
<P>At &s;uch a time, in &s;uch a &s;tate, &s;ome talk to us of lenity and compa&s;&s;ion. It is long that we have lo&s;t the right names of things. The Commonwealth is in this deplorable &s;ituation, only becau&s;e we call be&s;tow|ing
<PB N="49" REF="031827_0047_0FEEC396F527E518">
other people's e&s;tates, liberality, and audaciou&s;ne&s;s in perpetrating crimes, courage.</P>
<P>Let &s;uch men, &s;ince they will have it &s;o, and it is become the e&s;tabli&s;hed mode, value them&s;elves upon their liberality at the expen&s;e of the Allies of the em|pire, and of their lenity to the robbers of the public trea&s;ury: but let them not make a large&s;s of our blood; and, to &s;pare a &s;mall number of vile wretches, expo&s;e all good men to de&s;truction.</P>
<P>Do not imagine, Fathers, that it was by arms our ance&s;tors rendered this Commonwealth &s;o great, from &s;o &s;mall a beginning. If it had been &s;o, we &s;hould now &s;ee it much more flouri&s;hing, as we have more al|lies and citizens, more hor&s;e and foot, than they had. But they had other things, that made them great, of which no traces remain among&s;t us: at home, labor and indu&s;try; abroad, ju&s;t and equitable government; a con&s;tancy of &s;oul, and an innocence of manners, that kept them perfectly free in their councils; unre|&s;trained either by the remembrance of pa&s;t crimes, or by craving appetites to &s;atisfy.</P>
<P>For the&s;e virtues, we have luxury and avarice; or madne&s;s to &s;quander, joined with no le&s;s, to gain; the State is poor, and private men are rich. We ad|mire nothing but riches; we give our&s;elves up to &s;loth and effeminacy; we make no di&s;tinction between the good and the bad; whil&s;t ambition engro&s;&s;es all the re|wards of virtue. Do you wonder then, that danger|ous con&s;piracies &s;hould be formed? Whil&s;t you regard nothing but your private intere&s;t; whil&s;t voluptuou&s;|ne&s;s &s;olely employs you at home, and avidity or favor governs you here, the Commonwealth, without defence, is expo&s;ed to the devices of any one who thinks fit to attack it.</P>

<HEAD>DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE GHOSTS OF AN EN|GLISH DUELLIST, A NORTH-AMERICAN SAVAGE, AND MERCURY.</HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Duelli&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>MERCURY, Charon's boat is on the other &s;ide of the water. Allow me, before it returns, to have &s;ome conver&s;ation with the North-American Savage, whom you brought hither with me. I never before &s;aw one of that &s;pe|cies. He looks very grim. Pray, Sir, what is your name? I under&s;tand you &s;peak Engli&s;h.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Savage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I learned it in my childhood, having been bred for &s;ome years among the Engli&s;h of New-York. But, before I was a man, I returned to my val|iant countrymen, the Mohawks; and having been vil|lanou&s;ly cheated by one of yours in the &s;ale of &s;ome ruin, I never cared to have any thing to do with them afterwards. Yet I took up the hatchet for them with the re&s;t of my tribe in the late war again&s;t France, and was killed while I was out upon a &s;calping party. But I died very well &s;atisfied: for my brethren were vic|torious; and, before I was &s;hot, I had gloriou&s;ly &s;calp|ed &s;even men, and five women and children. In a former war, I had performed &s;till greater exploits. My name is the Bloody Bear: it was given me to expre&s;s my fiercene&s;s and valor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Duel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bloody Bear, I re&s;pect you, and am much your humble &s;ervant. My name is Tom Pu&s;hwell, very well known at Arthur's. I am a gentleman by my birth, and by profe&s;&s;ion a game&s;ter and man of hon|or. I have killed men in fair fighting, in honorable &s;ingle combat; but don't under&s;tand cutting the throats of women and children.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, that is our way of making war. Every na|tion has its cu&s;toms. But by the grimne&s;s of your coun|tenance, and that hole in your brea&s;t, I pre&s;ume you

were killed as I was, in &s;ome &s;calping party. How hap|pened it that your enemy did not take off your &s;calp?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Duel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I was killed in a duel. A friend of mine had lent me a &s;um of money; and after two or three years, being in great want him&s;elf, he a&s;ked me to pay him. I thought his demand, which was &s;omewhat peremptory, an affront to my honor, and &s;ent him a challenge. We met in Hyde Park. The fellow could not fence: but I was ab&s;olutely the adroite&s;t &s;word&s;|man in England. So I gave him three or four wounds; but at la&s;t he ran upon me with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity, that he put me out of my play, and I could not prevent him from whipping me through the lungs. I died the next day, as a man of honor &s;hould; without any &s;nivelling &s;igns of contrition or repentance: and he will follow me &s;oon; for his &s;urgeon has declared his wounds to be mortal. It is &s;aid that his wife is dead of grief, and that his family of &s;even children will be undone by his death. So I am well revenged, and that is a comfort. For my part, I had no wife. I always hated marriage: my mi&s;tre&s;s will take good care of her&s;elf, and my chil|dren are provided for at the foundling ho&s;pital.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mercury, I won't go in the boat with that fellow. He has murdered his countryman: he has murdered his friend: I &s;ay po&s;itively, I won't go in the boat with that fellow. I will &s;wim over the river: I can &s;wim like a duck.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Swim over the Styx! it mu&s;t not be done; it is again&s;t the laws of Pluto's empire. You mu&s;t go in the boat and be quiet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't tell me of laws: I am a &s;avage: I value no laws. Talk of laws to the Engli&s;hman: there are laws in his country; and yet you &s;ee he did not regard them. For they could never allow him to kill his fellow-&s;ubject, in time of peace, becau&s;e he a&s;k|ed him to pay an hone&s;t debt. I know indeed, that the Engli&s;h are a barbarous nation: but they can't po&s;&s;ibly be &s;o brutal as to make &s;uch things lawful.</P>

<P>I killed none but my enemies: I never killed my own countrymen: I never killed my friend.

<P>Eat! did you ever eat the liver of a French|man, or his leg, or his &s;houlder? There is fine eating for you! I have eat twenty. My table was always well &s;erved.

<OPENER><SALUTE>BROTHERS!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU remember, when you fir&s;t came over the great waters, I was great and you were little; very &s;mall. I then took you in for a friend, and kept you under my arms, &s;o that no one might injure you. Since that time we have ever been true friends: there has never been any quarrel between us. But now our conditions are changed. You are become great and tall. You reach to the clouds. You are &s;een all round the world. I am become &s;mall; very little. I am not &s;o high as your knee. Now you take care of me; and I look to you for protection.</P>
<P>Brothers! I am &s;orry to hear of this great quar|rel between you and Old England. It appears that blood mu&s;t &s;oon be &s;hed to end this quarrel. We never till this day under&s;tood the foundation of this quarrel between you and the country you came from. Broth|ers! Whenever I &s;ee your blood running, you will &s;oo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d me about you to revenge my brothers' blood. Although I am low and very &s;mall, I will gripe hold of your enemy's heel, that he cannot run &s;o fa&s;t, and &s;o light, as if he had nothing at his heels.</P>
<P>Brothers! You know I am not &s;o wi&s;e as you are, therefore I a&s;k your advice in what I am now going to &s;ay. I have been thinking, before you come to action, to take a run to the we&s;tward, and feel the mind of my Indian brethren the Six Nations, and know how they &s;tand; whether they are on your &s;ide, or for
<PB N="55" REF="031827_0053_0FEEC39E63C62078">
your enemies. If I find they are again&s;t you, I will try to turn their minds. I think they will li&s;ten to me; for they have always looked this way for advice, concerning all important news that comes from the ri&s;ing &s;un. If they hearken to me, you will not be afraid of any danger from behind you. However their minds are affected, you &s;hall &s;oon know by me. Now I think I can do you more &s;ervice in this way than by marching off immediately to Bo&s;ton, and &s;taying there. It may be a great while before blood runs. Now, as I &s;aid, you are wi&s;er than I, I leave this for your con|&s;ideration, whether I come down immediately, or wait till I hear &s;ome blood is &s;pilled.</P>
<P>Brothers! I would not have you think by this, that we are falling back from our engagements. We are ready to do any thing for your relief, and &s;hall be guided by your coun&s;el.</P>
<P>Brothers! one thing I a&s;k of you, if you &s;end for me to fight, that you you will let me fight in my own Indian way. I am not u&s;ed to fight Engli&s;h fa&s;hion; therefore you mu&s;t not expect I can train like your men. Only point out to me where your enemies keep, and that is all I &s;hall want to know.</P>

that "in the beginning God created," or from non-ex|i&s;tence brought into being, "the heavens and the earth."</P>
<P>But though there was a period when this globe, with all that we &s;ee upon it, did not exi&s;t, we have no rea&s;on to think, that the w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;dom and power of the Almighty were then without exerci&s;e or employment. Boundle&s;s is the extent of his dominion. Other globes and worlds, enlightened by other &s;uns, may then have occupied, they &s;till appear to occupy, the immen&s;e regions of &s;pace. Numberle&s;s orders of beings, to us unknown, people the wide extent of the uni|ver&s;e, and afford an endle&s;s variety of objects to the ruling care of the great Father of all. At length, in the cour&s;e and progre&s;s of his government, there ar|rived a period, when this earth was to be called into exi&s;tence. When the &s;ignal moment, prede&s;tinated from all eternity, was come, the Deity aro&s;e in his might, and with a word created the world.</P>

<HEAD>EXTRACT FROM MR. PITT'S SPEECH IN THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT, IN THE YEAR 1766, ON THE SUBJECT OF THE STAMP-ACT.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a long time, Mr. Speaker, &s;ince I have attended in parliament. When the re&s;olution was taken in the Hou&s;e to tax America, I was ill in bed. If I could have endured to have been carried in my bed, &s;o great was the agitation of my mind for the con&s;e|quences, that I would have &s;olicited &s;ome kind hand to have laid me down on this floor, to have borne my te&s;|timony again&s;t it. It is now an act that has pa&s;&s;ed. I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">uld &s;peak with decency of every act of this Hou&s;e; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> I mu&s;t beg the indulgence of the Hou&s;e to &s;peak of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> freedom.</P>

gentlemen will come to this debate with all the temper and impartiality that his Maje&s;ty recommends, and the importance of the &s;ubject requires. A &s;ubject of great|er importance than ever engaged the attention of this Hou&s;e! that &s;ubject only excepted, when, nearly a cen|tury ago, it was the que&s;tion, whether you your&s;elves were to be bond or free. In the mean time, as I can|not depend upon health for any future day, &s;uch is the nature of my infirmities, I will beg to &s;ay a few words at pre&s;ent, leaving the ju&s;tice, the equity, the policy, the expediency of the act to another time.</P>
<P>I will only &s;peak to one point, which &s;eems not to have been generally under&s;tood. Some gentlemen &s;eem to have con&s;idered it as a point of <HI>honor.</HI> If gentlemen con&s;ider it in that light, they leave all mea&s;ures of right and wrong, to follow a delu&s;ion that may lead to de|&s;truction. It is my opinion, that this kingdom has no right to lay a tax upon the Colonies. When in this Hou&s;e we give and grant, we give and grant what is our own. But in an American tax, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> do we do? We, your Maje&s;ty's Commons of Great Britain, give and grant to your Maje&s;ty, what? our own property? No. We give and grant to your Maje&s;ty, the property of your Maje&s;ty's Commons of America. It is an ab|&s;urdity in terms.</P>
<P>There is an idea in &s;ome&punc; that the Colonies are vir|tually repre&s;ented in this Hou&s;e. I would fain know by whom an American is repre&s;ented here? Is he rep|re&s;ented by any knight of the &s;hire, in any county in this kingdom? Or will you tell him that he is repre|&s;ented by any repre&s;entative of a borough; a borough, which perhaps no man ever &s;aw? This is what is call|ed the <HI>rotten part</HI> of the Con&s;titution. It cannot con|tinue a century. If it does not drop, it mu&s;t be am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+tated. The idea of a virtual repre&s;entation of Ameri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> in this Hou&s;e&punc; is the mo&s;t contemptible idea that entered into the head of a man. It does not de&s;cry &s;erious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nfu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ation.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="031827_0058_0FEEC35110A21268">The Commons of America, repre&s;ented in their &s;ev|eral a&s;&s;emblies, have ever been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the exer|ci&s;e of this, their con&s;titutional right of giving and grant|ing their own money. They would have been &s;laves if they had not enjoyed it.</P>
<P>A great deal has been &s;aid without doors, of the pow|er, of the &s;trength of America. It is a topic which ought to be cautiou&s;ly meddled with. In a good cau&s;e, on a &s;ound bottom, the force of this country can cru&s;h America to atoms. I know the valor of your troops. I know the &s;kill of your officers. There is not a com|pany of foot that has &s;erved in America, out of which you may not pick a man of &s;ufficient knowledge and experience, to make a governor of a Colony there. But on this ground, on the Stamp Act, when &s;o many here will think it a crying inju&s;tice, I am one who will lift up my hands again&s;t it.</P>
<P>In &s;uch a cau&s;e, your &s;ucce&s;s would be hazardous. America, if &s;he fell, would fall like the &s;trong man. She would embrace the pillars of the State, and pull down the con&s;titution along with her. Is this your boa&s;ted peace? Not to &s;heath the &s;word in its &s;cabbard, but to &s;heath it in the bowels of your countrymen? Will you quarrel with your&s;elves, now the whole Hou&s;e of Bour|bon is united again&s;t you?</P>
<P>The Americans have been wronged. They have been driven to madne&s;s by inju&s;tice. Will you puni&s;h them for the madne&s;s you have occa&s;ioned? Rather let prudence and temper come fir&s;t from this &s;ide. I will undertake for America, that &s;he will follow the example.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, I will beg leave to tell the Hou&s;e what is really my opinion. It is, that the Stamp Act <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> repealed ab&s;olutely, totally, and immediately.</P>

<HEAD>EXTRACT FROM THE EULOGY ON DR. FRANK|LIN, PRONOUNCED BY THE ABBE FAUCHET, IN THE NAME OF THE COMMONS OF PARIS, 1790.</HEAD>
<P>A SECOND creation has taken place; the ele|ments of &s;ociety begin to combine together; the moral univer&s;e is now &s;een i&s;&s;uing from chaos; the genius of Liberty is awakened, and &s;prings up; &s;he &s;heds her divine light and creative powers upon the two hemi&s;pheres. A great nation, a&s;toni&s;hed at &s;eeing her&s;elf free, &s;tretches her arms from one extremity of the earth to the other, and embraces the fir&s;t nation that became &s;o: the foundations of a new city are cre|ated in the two worlds; brother nations ha&s;ten to in|habit it. It is the city of mankind!</P>
<P>One of the fir&s;t founders of this univer&s;al city was the immortal FRANKLIN, the deliverer of America. The &s;econd founders, who accelerated this great work, made it worthy of Europe. The legi&s;lators of France have rendered the mo&s;t &s;olemn homage to his memory. They have &s;aid, "A friend of humanity is dead; mankind ought to be overwhelmed with &s;orrow! Na|tions have hitherto only worn mourning for Kings; let us a&s;&s;ume it for a Man, and let the tears of French|men mingle with tho&s;e of Americans, in order to do honor to the memory of one of the Fathers of Lib|erty!"</P>
<P>The city of Paris, which once contained this philo&s;|opher within its walls, which was intoxicated with the plea&s;ure of hearing, admiring, and loving him; of gathering from his lips the maxims of a moral legi&s;la|tor, and of imbibing from the effu&s;ions of his heart a pa&s;&s;ion for the public welfare, rivals Bo&s;ton and Phila|delphia, his two native cities (for in one he was born as it were a man, and in the other a legi&s;lator) in its pro|found attachment to his merit and his glory.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="031827_0063_0FEEC3B019E983B0">It has commanded this funeral &s;olemnity, in order to perpetuate the gratitude and the grief of this third country, which, by the courage and activity with which it has profited of his le&s;&s;ons, has &s;hown it&s;elf worthy of having him at once for an in&s;tructor and a model.</P>
<P>In &s;electing me for the interpreter of its wi&s;hes, it has declared, that it is le&s;s to the talents of an orator, than the patrioti&s;m of a citizen, the zeal of a preacher of liberty, and the &s;en&s;ibility of a friend of men, that it hath confided this &s;olemn function. In this point of view, I may &s;peak with firm confidence; for I have the public opinion, and the te&s;timony of my own con|&s;cience, to &s;econd my wi&s;hes. Since nothing el&s;e is wanting than freedom, and &s;en&s;ibility, for that &s;pecies of eloquence which this eulogium requires, I am &s;ati&s;|fied; for I already po&s;&s;e&s;s them.</P>
<P>My voice &s;hall extend to France, to America, to po&s;terity. I am now to do ju&s;tice to a great man, the founder of tran&s;atlantic freedom; I am to prai&s;e him in the name of the mother city of French liberty. I my&s;elf al&s;o am a man; I am a freeman; I po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;uffrages of my fellow-citizens: this is enough; my di&s;cour&s;e &s;hall be immortal.</P>
<P>The academies, the philo&s;ophical &s;ocieties, the learn|ed a&s;&s;ociations which have done them&s;elves honor by in|&s;cribing the name of Franklin in their records, can be&s;t appreciate the debt due to his genius, for having ex|tended the power of man over nature, and pre&s;ented new and &s;ublime ideas, in a &s;tyle &s;imple as truth, and pure as light.</P>
<P>It is not the naturali&s;t and the philo&s;opher that the orator of the Commons of Paris ought to de&s;cribe; it is the <HI>man,</HI> who hath accelerated the progre&s;s of &s;ocial order; it is the <HI>legi&s;lator,</HI> who hath prepared the lib|erty of nations!</P>
<P>Franklin, in his periodical works, which had prodi|gious circulation on the continent of America, laid the &s;acred foundations of &s;ocial morality. He was no le&s;s inimitable in the developements of the &s;ame morality,
<PB N="66" REF="031827_0064_0FEEC35ED09A9858">
when applied to the duties of friend&s;hip, general char|ity, the employment of one's time, the happine&s;s at|tendant upon good works, the nece&s;&s;ary combination of private with public welfare, the propriety and ne|ce&s;&s;ity of indu&s;try; and to that happy &s;tate which puts us at ea&s;e with &s;ociety and with our&s;elves. The prov|erbs of "Old Henry," and "Poor Richard," are in the hands both of the learned and the ignorant; they contain the mo&s;t &s;ublime morality, reduced to popular language and common comprehen&s;ion; and form the catechi&s;m of happine&s;s for all mankind.</P>
<P>Franklin was too great a morali&s;t, and too well acquainted with human affairs, not to perceive that women were the arbiters of manners. He &s;trove to perfect their empire; and accordingly engaged them to adorn the &s;ceptre of virtue with their graces. It is in their power to excite courage; to overthrow vice, by means of their di&s;dain; to kindle civi&s;m, and to light up in every heart the holy love of our country.</P>
<P>His daughter, who was opulent and honored with the public e&s;teem, helped to manufacture and to make up the clothing for the army with her own hands; and &s;pread abroad a noble emulation among the female citizens, who became eager to a&s;&s;i&s;t tho&s;e by means of the needle and the &s;pindle, who were &s;erving the &s;tate with their &s;words and their guns.</P>
<P>With the charm ever attendant upon true wi&s;dom and the grace ever flowing from true &s;entiment, this grave philo&s;opher knew how to conver&s;e with the other &s;ex; to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;pire them with a ta&s;te for dome&s;tic occupa|tions; to hold out to them the prize attendant upon honor unaccompanied by reproach, and in&s;til the duty of cultivating the fir&s;t precepts of education, in order to teach them to their children; and thus to acquit the debt due to nature, and fulfil the hope of &s;ocie|ty. It mu&s;t be acknowledged, that, in his own coun|try, he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to minds capable of compre|hending him.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="031827_0065_0FEEC3B46D58B808">Immortal females of America! I will tell it to the daughters of France, and they only are fit to applaud you!

It was among you that liberty was fir&s;t to have its origin. But the empire of freedom, which is extended to France, is about to carry your manners along with it, and produce a revolution in morals as well as in politics.</P>
<P>Already our female citizens, (for they have lately become &s;uch) are not any longer occupied with tho&s;e frivolous ornaments, and vain plea&s;ures, which were nothing more than the amu&s;ements of &s;lavery; they have awakened the love of liberty in the bo&s;oms of fa|thers, of brothers, and of hu&s;bands; they have en|couraged them to make the mo&s;t generous &s;acrifices; their delicate hands have removed the earth, dragged it along, and helped to elevate the immen&s;e amphithe|atre of the grand confederation. It is no longer the love of voluptuous &s;oftne&s;s that attracts their regard; it is the &s;acred fire of patrioti&s;m.</P>
<P>The laws which are to reform education, and with it the national manners, are already prepared; they will advance, they will fortify the cau&s;e of liberty by means of their happy influence, and become the &s;econd &s;aviours of their country!</P>
<P>Franklin did not omit any of the means of being u&s;e|ful to men, or &s;erviceable to &s;ociety. He &s;poke to all conditions, to both &s;exes, to every age. This amiable morali&s;t de&s;cended, in his writings, to the mo&s;t artle&s;s details; to the mo&s;t ingenuous familiarities; to the fir&s;t ideas of a rural, a commercial, and a civil life; to the dialogues of old men and children; full at once of all the verdure and all the maturity of wi&s;dom. In &s;hort, the prudent le&s;&s;ons ari&s;ing from the expo&s;ition of tho&s;e ob&s;cure, happy, ea&s;y virtues, which form &s;o many links in the chain of a good man's life, derived immen&s;e weight from that reputation for genius which he had
<PB N="68" REF="031827_0066_0FEEC361ACCD3530">
acquired, by being one of the fir&s;t naturali&s;ts and great|e&s;t philo&s;ophers in the univer&s;e.</P>
<P>At one and the &s;ame time, he governed nature in the heavens and in the hearts of men. Amid&s;t the tempe&s;ts of the atmo&s;phere, he directed the thunder; amid&s;t the &s;torms of &s;ociety, he directed the pa&s;&s;ions. Think, Gentlemen, with what attentive docility, with what religious re&s;pect, one mu&s;t hear the voice of a &s;imple man, who preached up human happine&s;s, when it was recollected that it was the powerful voice of the &s;ame man who regulated the lightning.</P>
<P>He electrified the con&s;ciences, in order to extract the de&s;tructive fire of vice, exactly in the &s;ame manner as he electrified the heavens, in order peaceably to invite them from the terrible fire of the elements.</P>
<P>Venerable old man! augu&s;t philo&s;opher! legi&s;lator of the felicity of thy country, prophet of the fraternity of the human race, what ec&s;tatic happine&s;s embelli&s;h|ed the end of thy career! From thy fortunate a&s;ylum, and in the mid&s;t of thy brothers who enjoyed in tran|quillity the fruit of thy virtues, and the &s;ucce&s;s of thy genius, thou ha&s;t &s;ung &s;ongs of deliverance. The la&s;t looks, which thou did&s;t ca&s;t around thee, beheld America happy; France, on the other &s;ide of the ocean, free, and a &s;ure indication of the approaching freedom and happi|ne&s;s of the world.</P>
<P>The United States, looking upon them&s;elves as thy children, have bewailed the death of the father of their republic. France, thy family by adoption, has hon|ored thee as the founder of her laws; and the human race has revered thee as the univer&s;al patriarch who has formed the alliance of nature with &s;ociety. Thy remembrance belongs to all ages; thy memory to all nations; thy glory to eternity!</P>

<HEAD>SELF-CONCEIT. AN ADDRESS, SPOKEN BY A VERY SMALL BOY.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN boys are exhibiting in public, the polite|ne&s;s or curio&s;ity of the hearers frequently in|duces them to inquire the names of the performers. To &s;ave the trouble of an&s;wers, &s;o far as relates to my|&s;elf, my name is Charles Chatterbox. I was born in this town; and have grown to my pre&s;ent enormous &s;tature, without any artificial help. It is true, I eat, drink, and &s;leep, and take as much care of my noble &s;elf, as any young man about; but I am a mon&s;trous great &s;tudent. There is no telling the half of what I have read.</P>
<P>Why, what do you think of the Arabian Tales? Truth; every word truth! There's the &s;tory of the lamp, and of Rook's eggs as big as a meeting-hou&s;e. And there is the hi&s;tory of Sindbad the &s;ailor. I have read every word of them. And I have read Tom Thumb's Folio through, Winter Evening Tales, and Seven Champions, and Pari&s;mus, and Pari&s;menus, and Valentine and Or&s;on, and Mother Bunch, and Seven Wi&s;e Ma&s;ters, and a curious book, entitled, Think well on't.</P>
<P>Then there is another wonderful book, containing fifty rea&s;ons why an old bachelor was not married. The fir&s;t was, that nobody would have him; and the &s;econd was, he declared to every body, that he would not marry; and &s;o it we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;tronger and &s;tronger. Then, at the clo&s;e of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ook, it gives an account of his marvellous death and burial. And in the appen|dix, it tells about his being ground over&punc;, and c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ing

out as young, and as fre&s;h, and as fair as ever. Then, every few pages, is a picture of him to the life.</P>
<P>I have al&s;o read Robin&s;on Cru&s;oe, and Reynard the fox, and Moll Flanders; and I have read twelve delightful novels, and Iri&s;h Rogues, and Life of Saint Patrick, and Philip Quarle, and Conjurer Crop, and Ae&s;op's Fables, and Laugh and be fat, and Toby Lump|kins' Elegy on the Birth of a Child, and a Comedy or the Death of his Brother, and an Acro&s;tic, occa&s;ioned by a mortal &s;ickne&s;s of his dear wife, of which &s;he re|covered. This famous author wrote a treati&s;e on that Ri&s;e and Progre&s;s of Vegetation; and a whole Bod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Divinity he compri&s;ed in four lines.</P>
<P>I have read all the works of Pero Gilpin, who&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> memory was &s;o extraordinary, that he never forgot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the hours of eating and &s;leeping. This Pero was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> rare lad. Why, he could &s;tand on his head, as if it were a real pede&s;tal; his feet he u&s;ed for drum&s;ticks. He was trumpeter to the foot guards in Queen Betty's time; and if he had not blown his breath away, might have lived to this day.</P>
<P>Then, I have read the hi&s;tory of a man who married for money, and of a woman that would wear her hu&s;|band's &s;mall-clothes in &s;pite of him; and I have read four books of riddles and rebu&s;es; and all that is not half a quarter.</P>
<P>Now what &s;ignifies reading &s;o much if one can't tell of it? In thinking over the&s;e things, I am &s;ometimes &s;o lo&s;t in company, that I don't hear any thing that is &s;aid, till &s;ome one pops out that witty &s;aying, "A penny for your thoughts." Then I &s;ay, to be &s;ure, I was thinking of a book I had been reading. Once, in this mood, I came very near &s;wallowing my cup and &s;aucer; and another time, was upon the very point of taking down a punch-bowl, that held a gallon. Now if I could fairly have gotten them down, they would not have hurt me a jot; for my mind is capacious enough for a china-&s;hop. There is no choaking a man of my reading. Why, if my mind can contain Genii and
<PB N="72" REF="031827_0070_0FEEC367CE865A70">
Giants, &s;ixty feet high, and enchanted ca&s;tles, why not a punch-bowl, and a whole tea-board?</P>
<P>It was always conjectured that I &s;hould be a mon|&s;trous great man; and I believe, as much as I do the Spani&s;h war, that I &s;hall be a perfect Brobdingnag in time.</P>
<P>Well now, do you &s;ee, when I have read a book, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o right off into the company of the ladies; for they are the judges whether a man knows any thing or not. Then I bring on a &s;ubject which will &s;how my parts to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e be&s;t advantage; and I always mind and &s;ay's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">art thing ju&s;t before I quit.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t know, moreover, that I have learned a great deal of wit. I was the fir&s;t man who invented all that people &s;ay about cold tongues, and warm <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ngues, and may-bees. I invented the wit of ki&s;&s;ing the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> candle&s;tick when a lady holds it; as al&s;o the plays of criminal and cro&s;s-que&s;tion; and above all, I invent|ed the wit of paying toll at bridges. In &s;hort, ladies and gentlemen, take me all in all, I am a downright curious fellow.</P>

<HEAD>THE WONDERS OF NATURE.</HEAD>
<P>HOW mighty! how maje&s;tic! and how my&s;teri|ous are nature's works! When the air is calm, where &s;leep the &s;tormy winds? In what chambers are they repo&s;ed, or in what dungeons confined? But when He, "who holds them in his fi&s;t," is plea&s;ed to awaken their rage, and throw open their pri&s;on doors, then, with irre&s;i&s;tible impetuo&s;ity, they ru&s;h forth, &s;cattering dread, and menacing de&s;truction.</P>
<P>The atmo&s;phere is hurled into the mo&s;t tumultuous confu&s;ion. The aerial torrent bur&s;ts its way over moun|tains, &s;eas, and continents. All things feel the dread|ful &s;hock. All things tremble before the furious bla&s;t. The fore&s;t, vexed and torn, groans under the &s;courge.

Her &s;turdy &s;ons are &s;trained to the very root, and al|mo&s;t &s;weep the &s;oil they were wont to &s;hade. The &s;tubborn oak, that di&s;dains to bend, is da&s;hed headlong to the ground; and, with &s;hattered arms, with pro&s;|trate trunk, blocks up the road. While the flexile reed, that &s;prings up in the mar&s;h, yielding to the gu&s;t, (as the meek and pliant temper, to injuries, or the re|&s;igned and patient &s;pirit, to misfortunes) eludes the force of the &s;torm, and &s;urvives amid&s;t the wide-&s;pread havoc.</P>

Soon the &s;ounding &s;quadrons of the air return to the attack, and renew their ravages with redoubled fury. The &s;tately dome rocks amid&s;t the wheeling clouds. The impregnable tower totters on its ba&s;is, and threatens to overwhelm whom it was intended to protect. The ragged rocks are rent in pieces; and even the hills, the perpetual hills, on their deep foundations are &s;carcely &s;ecure. Where now is the place of &s;afety? when the city reels, and hou&s;es become heaps! Sleep affrighted flies. Diver&s;ion is turned into horror. All is uproar in the element; all is con&s;ternation among mortals; and nothing but one wide &s;cene of rueful deva&s;tation through the land.</P>
<P>The ocean &s;wells with tremendous commotions. The ponderous waves are heaved from their capacious bed, and almo&s;t lay bare the unfathomable deep. Flung in|to the mo&s;t rapid agitation, they &s;weep over the rocks; they la&s;h the lofty cliffs, and to&s;s them&s;elves into the clouds. Navies are rent from their anchors; and with all their enormous load, are whirled &s;wift as the arrow, wild as the winds, along the va&s;t aby&s;s.

<HEAD>ORATION DELIVERED AT PARIS BY CITIZEN CARNOT, PRESIDENT OF THE EXECUTIVE DI|RECTORY, AT THE FESTIVAL OF GRATITUDE AND VICTORY, CELEBRATED AT THE CHAMP|DE-MARS,
<DATE>MAY 29, 1796.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>IT is at the moment when nature is renovated, when the earth adorned with flowers and dre&s;&s;ed in green, promi&s;es new harve&s;ts; when all beings proclaim in their own language, the beneficent intelligence which renovates the univer&s;e, that the French people a&s;&s;em|ble, on this great fe&s;tival, to render a di&s;tingui&s;hed hom|age to tho&s;e talents and virtues of the friends of the country and humanity. What day can better unite all hearts! What citizen, what man can be a &s;tranger to the influence of gratitude! We exi&s;t only through an uninterrupted cour&s;e of beneficence, and our life is but a continual exchange of &s;ervices.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as born, our eyes, fixed on the heavens, appear already to acknowledge a primary benefactor. Weak, without &s;upport, the love of our parents watches over our infancy, and provides for wants continually renewed. They direct our fir&s;t &s;teps; their patient &s;olicitude a&s;&s;i&s;ts in developing our organs; we receive from them our fir&s;t ideas of what we are our&s;elves, and of &s;urrounding objects. Additional care models our hearts to affection, our minds to knowledge, and our bodies to u&s;eful labor. It is for our happine&s;s, that the wi&s;e have reflected on the duties of man; that the learned have diven into the &s;ecrets of nature&punc; that the magi&s;trate watches, and that the legi&s;lator prepares in deliberation protecting laws.</P>
<P>Soon we are enabled to be u&s;eful. Good children, we &s;trew flowers over the age of our parents, and their trembling voice ble&s;&s;es us in their la&s;t moments. Be|come parents in our turn, we prepare, in the education of our children, the felicity of our declining years;
<PB N="83" REF="031827_0081_0FEEC3CCD91704F8">
and we thus continue in a new generation the chain of benevolence and gratitude. Sen&s;ibility is not re|&s;tricted within the family circle; the indigent is &s;earch|ed for under the thatch; &s;uccours and con&s;olation are lavi&s;hed; and the donor, at fir&s;t paid for the good ac|tion by the plea&s;ure of having performed it, is doub|ly rewarded by the gratitude of the object. Benevo|lence! how happy are thy votaries, and how much to be pitied, the &s;oul that knows thee not!</P>
<P>He who is a good &s;on and a good father is al&s;o a good citizen. He loves his country; renders with alacrity the tribute of &s;ervices; he delights in return|ing to his brothers the protection he has received from them.

<P>You, to whom France owes its political regeneration; courageous philo&s;ophers, who&s;e writings have planted the &s;eeds of the revolution, corroded the fetters of &s;la|very, and blunted by degrees the ravings of fanatici&s;m. You, citizens, who&s;e dauntle&s;s courage effected this happy revolution; founded the republic, and contend|ed the&s;e &s;even years again&s;t crime and ambition, royal|i&s;m and anarchy. You all, in a word, who labor to render France happy and flouri&s;hing; who render it illu&s;trious by your talents, and enrich it by your di&s;cov|eries; receive the &s;olemn te&s;timony of national grati|tude.</P>
<P>Receive that te&s;timony particularly, republican ar|mies; you, who&s;e glory and &s;ucce&s;&s;es are fre&s;h in the
<PB N="84" REF="031827_0082_0FEEC37AAEA56800">
recollection of all. It is you who have defended us again&s;t ten combined kings; who have driven them from our territory; have transferred to their dominions the &s;courge of war. You have not only conquered men; you have overcome the ob&s;tacles thrown in your way by nature. You have triumphed over fatigue, hunger, and winter. What a &s;pectacle for the people! what a dreadful le&s;&s;on to the enemies of liberty!</P>
<P>A new-born republic arms its children to defend its independence; nothing can re&s;train their impetuo&s;ity; traver&s;ing rivers, carrying intrenchments, climbing rocks. Here, after a &s;eries of victories, they pu&s;hed back our limits to tho&s;e barriers that nature intended for us, and pur&s;uing over ice the remains of three ar|mies, transformed an oppre&s;&s;ed and ho&s;tile nation into a free and allied people. There they fly to exterminate the hordes of traitors and villains, &s;ub&s;idized by En|gland; puni&s;h their thieves, and re&s;tore to the repub|lic brothers too long mi&s;led. Here, &s;urmounting the Pyrenees, and precipitating them&s;elves from their &s;um|mit; overthrowing whatever oppo&s;es their progre&s;s, and checked only by an honorable peace; there a&s;|cending the Alps and Appenines, they fly acro&s;s the Po and Adige.</P>
<P>The ardor of the &s;oldier is &s;econded by the genius and boldne&s;s of the chiefs. They plan with &s;cience, and execute with energy; now di&s;playing their forces with calmne&s;s; then courting danger at the head of their brothers in arms. Oh that I could here di&s;play the immen&s;e and glorious picture of their victories! that I could name our mo&s;t intrepid defenders! What a crowd of &s;ublime images and beloved names pre&s;s up|on my recollection! Immortal warriors, po&s;terity will not believe the multitude of your triumphs; but to us hi&s;tory lo&s;es all its improbabilities.</P>
<P>But do we not &s;ee, even on this &s;pot, a portion of tho&s;e brave defenders? Victors over the exterior ene|mies of the &s;tate, they have come to repre&s;s our inter|nal enemies; and pre&s;erve at home the republic
<PB N="85" REF="031827_0083_0FEEC3D4389B5158">
which they have cau&s;ed to be re&s;pected abroad. Do we not al&s;o &s;ee tho&s;e venerable warriors who have grown grey in the &s;ervice; tho&s;e whom honorable wounds have obliged to &s;eek premature repo&s;e, and who&s;e a&s;ylum is in &s;ight? With what plea&s;ure our eyes feed on this intere&s;ting reunion. With what agreeable emotions we contemplate tho&s;e victorious brows!</P>
<P>Heroes who have peri&s;hed for liberty, why does there remain to us nothing but a recollection of your &s;ervices? You will, however, live forever in our hearts; your children will be dear to us; the republic will repay to them the debt they owe to you; and we di&s;charge here the fir&s;t by proclaiming your glory and our grat|itude.

<HEAD>ADDRESS OF MR. ADET, FRENCH AMBASSA|DOR, ON PRESENTING THE COLORS OF FRANCE TO THE UNITED STATES, 1796.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MR. PRESIDENT,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I COME to acquit my&s;elf of a duty very dear to my heart. I come to depo&s;it in your hands, and in the mid&s;t of a people ju&s;tly renowned for their cour|age, and their love of liberty, the &s;ymbol of the tri|umph and of the enfranchi&s;ement of my nation.</P>
<P>When &s;he broke her chains; when &s;he proclaimed the impre&s;criptible rights of man; when, in a terrible war, &s;he &s;ealed with her blood the covenant made with liberty, her own happine&s;s was not alone the object of her glorious efforts; her views extended al&s;o to all free people; &s;he &s;aw their intere&s;ts blended with her

own, and doubly rejoiced in her victories, which, in a&s;&s;uring to her the enjoyments of her rights, became to them new guarantees of their independence.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;entiments, which animated the French na|tion, from the dawn of their revolution, have acquired new &s;trength &s;ince the foundation of the republic. France, at that time, by the form of its government a&s;&s;imilated to, or rather indentified with free people, &s;aw in them only friends and brothers. Long accu&s;tomed to regard the American people as their mo&s;t faith|ful allies, &s;he has &s;ought to draw clo&s;er the ties already formed in the fields of America, under the au&s;pices of victory over the ruins of tyranny.</P>
<P>The National Convention, the organs of the will of the French Nation, have more than once expre&s;&s;ed their &s;entiments to the American people; but above all, the&s;e bur&s;t forth on that augu&s;t day, when the Mini&s;ter of the United States pre&s;ented to the National Repre|&s;entation, the colors of his country, de&s;iring never to lo&s;e recollections as dear to Frenchmen as they mu&s;t be to Americans. The Convention ordered that the&s;e colors &s;hould be placed in the hall of their &s;ittings. They had experienced &s;en&s;ations too agreeable not to cau&s;e them to be partaken of by their allies, and de|creed that to them the national colors &s;hould be pre|&s;ented.</P>
<P>Mr. Pre&s;ident, I do not doubt their expectations will be fulfilled; and I am convinced, that every citi|zen will receive, with a plea&s;ing emotion, this flag, el&s;ewhere the terror of the enemies of liberty; here the certain pledge of faithful friend&s;hip; e&s;pecially when they recollect that it guides to combat, men who have &s;hared their toils, and who were prepared for lib|erty, by aiding them to acquire their own.</P>

<P>WELL, my dear, I have warned all the families out of my long range of buildings, and ordered them to pay double the rent they have done, for every day they remain.

<HEAD>LORD MANSFIELD'S SPEECH, IN SUPPORT OF A BILL FOR PREVENTING DELAYS OF JUSTICE, BY REASON OF PRIVILEGE OF PARLIAMENT, 1770.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE waited with patience to hear what argu|ments might be urged again&s;t the bill; but I have waited in vain; the truth is, there is no argument that can weigh again&s;t it. The ju&s;tice and expediency of the bill are &s;uch as render it &s;elf-evident. It is a propo|&s;ition of that nature, that can neither be weakened by argument, nor entangled with &s;ophi&s;try.</P>
<P>We all know, that the very &s;oul and e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of trad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> are regular payments; and &s;ad experi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">
<PB N="95" REF="031827_0093_0FEEC439E1984BC8">
that there are men, who will not make their regular payments without the compul&s;ive power of the laws. The law then ought to be equally open to all. Any exemption to particular men, or particular ranks of men, is, in a free and commercial country, a &s;oleci&s;m of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t nature.</P>
<P>I will not trouble your lord&s;hips with arguments for that which is &s;ufficiently evident without any. I &s;hall only &s;ay a few words to &s;ome noble lords, who fore|&s;ee much inconveniency from the per&s;ons of their &s;er|vants' being liable to be arre&s;ted. One noble lord ob|&s;erves, that the coachman of a peer may be arre&s;ted while he is driving his ma&s;ter to the Hou&s;e; and, con|&s;equently, he will not be able to attend his duty in parliament. If this were actually to happen, there are &s;o many ways by which the member might &s;till get to the Hou&s;e, that I can hardly think the noble lord is &s;e|rious in his objection. Another noble peer &s;aid, that by this bill we might lo&s;e our mo&s;t valuable and hone&s;t &s;ervants. This I hold to be a contradiction in terms: for he can neither be a valuable &s;ervant, nor an hone&s;t man, who gets into debt which he is neither able nor willing to pay, till compelled by law.</P>
<P>If my &s;ervant, by unfore&s;een accidents, has run into debt, and I &s;till wi&s;h to retain him, I certainly would pay the debt. But upon no principle of liberal legi&s;|lation whatever, can my &s;ervant have a title to &s;et his creditors at defiance, while for forty &s;hillings only, the hone&s;t trade&s;man may be torn from his family, and locked up in a jail. It is mon&s;trous inju&s;tice! I flat|ter my&s;elf, however, the determination of this day will entirely put an end to all &s;uch partial proceedings for the future, by pa&s;&s;ing into a law the bill now under your lord&s;hips' con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>I come now to &s;peak, upon what, indeed, I would have gladly avoided, had I not been particularly point|ed at for the part I have taken in this bill. It has been &s;aid by a noble lord on my left hand, that I like|wi&s;e am running the race of popularity. If the noble
<PB N="96" REF="031827_0094_0FEEC3E72DEAAB50">
lord means by popularity, that applau&s;e be&s;towed by after-ages on good and virtuous actions, I have long been &s;truggling in that race. But if he mean that mu&s;hroom popularity, which is rai&s;ed without merit and lo&s;t without a crime, he much mi&s;takes in his opinion.</P>
<P>I defy the noble lord to point out a &s;ingle action of my life, where the popularity of the times ever had the &s;malle&s;t influence on my determinations. I have a more permanent and &s;teady rule for my conduct, the dictates of my own brea&s;t. Tho&s;e who have foregone that plea&s;ing advi&s;er, and given up their mind to be the &s;lave of every popular impul&s;e, I &s;incerely pity. I pity them &s;till more, if their vanity leads them to mi&s;|take the &s;houts of a mob for the trumpet of fame. Ex|perience might inform them, that many who have been &s;aluted with the huzzas of a crowd, one day, have received their execrations the next; and many, who, by the popularity of their times, have been held up as &s;potle&s;s patriots, have, neverthele&s;s, appeared upon the hi&s;torian's page, when truth has triumphed over delu|&s;ion, the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins of liberty.</P>
<P>Why then the noble lord can think I am ambitious of pre&s;ent popularity, that echo of folly, and &s;hadow of renown, I am at a lo&s;s to determine. Be&s;ides, I do not know that the bill now before your lord&s;hips will be popular. It depends much upon the caprice of the day. It may not be popular to compel people to pay their debts; and, in that ca&s;e, the pre&s;ent mu&s;t be a very unpopular bill. It may not be popular neither to take away any of the privileges of parliament; for I very well remember, and many of your lord&s;hips may remember, that not long ago the popular cry was for the exten&s;ion of privilege; and &s;o far did they carry it at that time, that it was &s;aid that the privilege protected members even in criminal actions. Nay, &s;uch was the power of popular prejudices over weak minds, that the very deci&s;ions of &s;ome of the courts were tinc|tured with that doctrine.</P>

<HEAD>EXTRACT FROM A SERMON ON THE DAY OF JUDGMENT.</HEAD>
<P>LET us endeavor to realize the maje&s;ty and terror of the univer&s;al alarm on the final Judgment Day. When the dead are &s;leeping in the &s;ilent grave; when the living are thoughtle&s;s and unapprehen&s;ive of the grand event, or intent on other pur&s;uits; &s;ome of them a&s;leep in the dead of night; &s;ome of them di&s;&s;olved in &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ures, eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage; &s;ome of them planning or execu|ting &s;chemes for riches or honors; &s;ome in the very act of &s;in; the generality &s;tupid and carele&s;s about the concerns of eternity, and the dreadful day ju&s;t at hand; and a few here and there conver&s;ing with their God, and looking for the glorious appearance of their Lord and Saviour; when the cour&s;e of nature runs on uniform and regular as u&s;ual, and infidel &s;coffers are taking umbrage from thence to a&s;k, "Where is the promi&s;e of his coming?" In &s;hort, when there are no more vi&s;ible appearances of this approaching day, than of the de&s;truction of Sodom, on that clear morning in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Lot fled away; or of the deluge, when Noah en|tered
<PB N="98" REF="031827_0096_0FEEC3E8B54CBEB0">
into the ark: then, in that hour of unapprehen&s;ive &s;ecurity, then &s;uddenly &s;hall the heavens open over the a&s;toni&s;hed world; then &s;hall the alarming clangor break over their heads like a clap of thunder in a clear &s;ky.</P>
<P>Immediately the living turn their gazing eyes upon the amazing phenomenon: &s;ome hear the long-ex|pected &s;ound with rapture, and lift up their heads with joy, a&s;&s;ured that the day of their redemption is come; while the thoughtle&s;s world are &s;truck with the wild|e&s;t horror and con&s;ternation. In the &s;ame in&s;tant the &s;ound reaches all the man&s;ions of the dead; and in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, they are rai&s;ed, and the living are changed. This call will be as ani|mating to all the &s;ons of men, as that call to a &s;ingle per&s;on, "Lazarus, come forth." O what a &s;urpri&s;e will this be to the thoughtle&s;s world! Should this alarm bur&s;t over our heads this moment, into what a terror would it &s;trike many in this a&s;&s;embly? Such will be the terror, &s;uch the con&s;ternation, when it actually comes to pa&s;s. Sinners will be the &s;ame timorous, &s;elf-condemned creatures then as they are now. And then they will not be able to &s;top their ears, who are deaf to all the gentler calls of the go&s;pel now.</P>
<P>Then the trump of God will con&s;train them to hear and fear, to whom the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t now preach in vain. Then they mu&s;t all hear; for, "all that are in their graves," all without exception, "&s;hall hear his voice." Now the voice of mercy calls, rea&s;on pleads, con&s;cience warns; but multitudes will not hear. But this is a voice which &s;hall, which mu&s;t reach every one of the millions of mankind, and not one of them will be able to &s;top his ears. Infants and giants, kings and &s;ubjects, all ranks, all ages of mankind &s;hall hear the call. The living &s;hall &s;tart and be changed, and the dead ri&s;e at the &s;ound. The du&s;t that was once alive and formed a human body, whether it flies in the air, floats in the ocean, or vegetates on earth, &s;hall hear the new-creating fiat. Wherever the fragments of the human frame are &s;cattered, this all-penetrating <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="99" REF="031827_0097_0FEEC4400D5C1EC8">
&s;hall reach and &s;peak them into life. We may con&s;ider this voice as a &s;ummons not only to dead bodies to ri&s;e, but to the &s;ouls that once animated them, to appear and be re-united to them.</P>
<P>This &s;ummons &s;hall &s;pread through every corner of the univer&s;e; and Heaven, Earth, and Hell, and all their inhabitants, &s;hall hear and obey. Now methinks I &s;ee, I hear the earth heaving, charnal hou&s;es rattling, tombs bur&s;ting, graves opening. Now the nations un|der ground begin to &s;tir. There is a noi&s;e and a &s;ha|king among the dry bones. The du&s;t is all alive, and in motion, and the globe breaks and trembles, as with an earthquake, while this va&s;t army is working its way through, and bur&s;ting into life. The ruins of human bodies are &s;cattered far and wide, and have pa&s;&s;ed through many, and &s;urpri&s;ing transformations. A limb in one country, and another in another; here the head, and there the trunk; and the ocean rolling between.</P>
<P>And now, at the &s;ound of the trumpet, they &s;hall all be collected, wherever they were &s;cattered; all prop|erly &s;orted and united, however they were confu&s;ed; atom to its fellow atom, bone to its fellow bone. Now methinks you may &s;ee the air darkened with fragments of bodies, flying from country to country, to meet and join their proper parts:
<Q><L>&mdash;"Scatter'd limbs and all</L>
<L>The various bones ob&s;equious to the call,</L>
<L>Self-mov'd, advance; the neck perhaps to meet</L>
<L>The di&s;tant head, the di&s;tant legs, the feet.</L>
<L>Dreadful to view, &s;ee through the du&s;ky &s;ky</L>
<L>Fragments of bodies in confu&s;ion fly,</L>
<L>To di&s;tant regions journeying, there to claim</L>
<L>De&s;erted members, and complete the frame.</L>
<L>The &s;ever'd head and trunk &s;hall join once more,</L>
<L>Though realms now ri&s;e between, and oceans roar.</L>
<L>The trumpet's &s;ound each vagrant mote &s;hall hear,</L>
<L>Or fix'd in earth, or if afloat in air,</L>
<L>Obey the &s;ignal, wafted in the wind,</L>
<L>And not one &s;leeping atom lag behind."</L></Q></P>

Ah, and if men were made to be &s;laves and ma&s;ters, why was not one man born with a whip in his hand and gold &s;poon in his mouth; and another, with a chain on his arm, or a fetter to his heel; aye, and without a tongue, or a pair of jaws, &s;o long as one mu&s;t not be allowed to u&s;e them? And if I had known I were to live a dog's life in this hard-hearted country, as I am a Chri&s;tian, I would have fought ye till I died. But, look ye! all hands upon deck; this muckle arm of mine is free; and by the blood of my heart, it &s;hall be torn from my body, before I will be bound once more, it &s;hall.</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION OF A CELEBRATED SPEECH OF MR. PITT, IN 1770, IN SUPPORT OF A MOTION MADE IN PARLIAMENT, TO REQUEST THE KING TO LAY BEFORE THAT BODY ALL THE PAPERS, RELATIVE TO CERTAIN DEPREDATIONS OF THE SPANIARDS, AND LIKEWISE, TO A TREATY WHICH HE WAS THEN NEGOCIATING WITH SPAIN.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE taken a wide circuit, and tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed, I fear, too long upon your patience. Yet I cannot con|clude without endeavoring to bring home your thoughts to an object more immediately intere&s;ting to us than any I have yet con&s;idered: I mean the in|ternal condition of this country. We may look abroad for wealth, or triumphs, or luxury; but England, my lords, is the main &s;tay, the la&s;t re&s;ort of the whole empire. To this point every &s;cheme of policy, whether foreign or dome&s;tic, &s;hould ultimately refer.</P>
<P>Have any mea&s;ures been taken to &s;atisfy, or to unite the people? Are the grievances they have &s;o long complained of removed? or do they &s;tand not only unredre&s;&s;ed, but aggravated? Is the right of free election re&s;tored to the elective body? My lords, I my&s;elf am one of the people. I e&s;teem that &s;ecurity and independence, which is the original birthright of an Engli&s;hman, far beyond the privileges, however &s;plendid, which are annexed to the peerage. I my|&s;elf am by birth an Engli&s;h elector, and join with the freeholders of England as in a common cau&s;e. Believe me, my lords, we mi&s;take our real intere&s;t as much as our duty, when we &s;eparate our&s;elves from the ma&s;s of the people.</P>
<P>Can it be expected that Engli&s;hmen will unite heart|ily in defence of a government, by which they feel them|&s;elves in&s;ulted and oppre&s;&s;ed? Re&s;tore them to their
<PB N="120" REF="031827_0118_0FEEC40F186E8828">
rights; that is the true way to make them unanimous. It is not a ceremonious recommendation from the throne, that can bring back peace and harmony to a di&s;content|ed people. That in&s;ipid annual opiate has been ad|mini&s;tered &s;o long, that it has lo&s;t its effect. Some|thing &s;ub&s;tantial, &s;omething effectual mu&s;t be done.</P>
<P>The public credit of the nation &s;tands next in degree to the rights of the con&s;titution; it calls loudly for the interpo&s;ition of parliament. There is a &s;et of men, my lords, in the city of London, who are known to live in riot and luxury, upon the plunder of the igno|rant, the innocent, the helple&s;s; upon that part of the community, which &s;tands mo&s;t in need of, and be&s;t de|&s;erves the care and protection of the legi&s;lature. To me, my lords whether they be mi&s;erable jobbers of Exchange Alley, or the lofty A&s;iatic plunderers of Leadenhall-&s;treet, they are all equally dete&s;table. I care but little whether a man walks on foot, or is drawn by eight or &s;ix hor&s;es. If his luxury be &s;up|ported by the plunder of his country, I de&s;pi&s;e and dete&s;t him.</P>
<P>My lords, while I had the honor of &s;erving his Maj|e&s;ty, I never ventured to look at the Trea&s;ury but at a di&s;tance; it is a bu&s;ine&s;s I am unfit for, and to which I never could have &s;ubmitted. The little I know of it has not &s;erved to rai&s;e my opinion of what is vul|garly called the <HI>monied intere&s;t;</HI> I mean that blood|&s;ucker, that m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ck-worm, which calls it&s;elf the friend of government; that pretends to &s;erve this or that ad|mini&s;tration, and may be purcha&s;ed, on the &s;ame terms, by <HI>any</HI> admini&s;tration; that advances money to gov|ernment, and takes &s;pecial care of its own emoluments.</P>
<P>I hope, my lords, that nothing I have &s;aid will be under<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">d to extend to the hone&s;t, indu&s;trious trade&s;|man, who holds the middle rank, and has given re|peated proofs, that he prefers law and liberty to gold. I love that cla&s;s of m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n. Much le&s;s would I be thought to reflect upon the fair merchant, who&s;e liberal com|merce
<PB N="121" REF="031827_0119_0FEEC469A6C5C418">
is the prime &s;ource of national wealth. I e&s;teem his occupation, and re&s;pect his character.</P>
<P>My lords, if the general repre&s;entation, which I have had the honor to lay before you, of the &s;ituation of public affairs, has in any mea&s;ure engaged your at|tention, your lord&s;hips, I am &s;ure, will agree with me, that the &s;ea&s;on calls for more than common prudence and vigor in the direction of your councils. The dif|ficulty of the cri&s;is demands a wi&s;e, a firm, and a pop|ular admini&s;tration. The di&s;honorable traffic of places has engaged us too long. Upon this &s;ubject, my lords, I &s;peak without intere&s;t or enmity. I have no per&s;onal objection to any of the king's &s;ervants. I &s;hall never be mini&s;ter; certainly, not without full power to cut away all the rotten branches of government. Yet, un|concerned as I truly am for my&s;elf, I cannot avoid &s;ee|ing &s;ome capital errors in the di&s;tribution of the royal favor.</P>
<P>I know I &s;hall be accu&s;ed of attempting to revive di&s;tinctions. My lords, if it were po&s;&s;ible, I would aboli&s;h all di&s;tinctions. I would not wi&s;h the favors of the crown to flow invariably in one channel. But there are &s;ome di&s;tinctions which are inherent in the nature of things. There is a di&s;tinction between right and wrong; between whig and tory.</P>
<P>When I &s;peak of an admini&s;tration, &s;uch as the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of the &s;ea&s;on calls for, my views are large and comprehen&s;ive. It mu&s;t be popular, that it may begin with reputation. It mu&s;t be &s;trong within it&s;elf, that it may proceed with vigor and deci&s;ion. An admini&s;|tration, formed upon an exclu&s;ive &s;y&s;tem of family con|nexions, or private friend&s;hips, cannot, I am convinced, be long &s;upported in this country.</P>
<P>I &s;hall trouble your lord&s;hips with but a few words more. His Maje&s;ty tells us in his &s;peech, that he will call upon us for our advice, if it &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary in the farther progre&s;s of this affair. It is not ea&s;y to &s;ay whether or not the mini&s;try are &s;erious in this decla|ration; nor what is meant by the <HI>progre&s;s</HI> of an affair,
<PB N="122" REF="031827_0120_0FEEC413A6305E00">
which re&s;ts upon one fixed point. Hitherto we have not been called upon. But though we are not con|&s;ulted, it is our right and duty, as the king's great, hereditary council, to <HI>offer</HI> him our advice. The pa|pers, mentioned in the noble Duke's motion, will en|able us to form a ju&s;t and accurate opinion of the con|duct of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervants, though not of the actual &s;tate of their honorable negociations.</P>
<P>The mini&s;try, too, &s;eem to want advice upon &s;ome points, in which their own &s;afety is immediately con|cerned. They are now balancing between a war, which they ought to have fore&s;een; but for which they have made no provi&s;ion, and an ignominious com|promi&s;e. Let me warn them of their danger. If they are forced into a war, they &s;tand it at the hazard of their heads. If, by an ignominious compromi&s;e, they &s;hould &s;tain the honor of the crown, or &s;acrifice the rights of the people, let them look to their con&s;ciences, and con&s;ider whether they will be able to walk the &s;treets in &s;afety.</P>

<HEAD>SOCRATES' DEFENCE BEFORE HIS ACCUSERS AND JUDGES.</HEAD>
<P>I AM accu&s;ed of corrupting the youth, and of in&s;till|ing dangerous principles into them, as well in re|gard to the wor&s;hip of the gods, as the rulers of gov|ernment. You know, Athenians, I never made it my <HI>profe&s;&s;ion</HI> to teach; nor can envy, however violent again&s;t me, reproach me with having ever &s;old my in|&s;tructions. I have an undeniable evidence for me in this re&s;pect, which is my poverty. Always equally ready to communicate my thoughts either to the rich or poor, and to give them entire lei&s;ure to que&s;tion or an&s;wer me, I lend my&s;elf to every one who is de&s;irous of becoming virtuous; and if among&s;t tho&s;e who hear me, there are any who prove either good or bad, nei|ther the virtues of the one, nor the vices of the other,
<PB N="123" REF="031827_0121_0FEEC46DDDF54FC0">
to which I have not contributed, are to be a&s;cribed to me.</P>
<P>My whole employment is to per&s;uade the young and old again&s;t too much love for the body, for riches, and all other precarious things of what&s;oever nature they be, and again&s;t too little regard for the &s;oul which ought to be the object of their affection. For I ince&s;|&s;antly urge to you, that virtue does not proceed from riches, but on the contrary, riches from virtue; and that all the other goods of human life, as well public as private, have their &s;ource in the &s;ame principle.</P>
<P>If to &s;peak in this manner be to corrupt youth, I confe&s;s, Athenians, that I am guilty, and de&s;erve to be puni&s;hed. If what I &s;ay be not true, it is mo&s;t ea&s;y to convict me of my fal&s;ehood. I &s;ee here a great number of my di&s;ciples: they have only to appear. But perhaps the re&s;erve and con&s;ideration for a ma&s;ter, who has in&s;tructed them, will prevent them from de|claring again&s;t me: at lea&s;t their fathers, brothers, and uncles cannot, as good relations and good citizens, di&s;|pen&s;e with their not &s;tanding forth to demand ven|geance again&s;t the corrupter of their &s;ons, brothers, and nephews. But the&s;e are the per&s;ons who take upon them my defence, and intere&s;t them&s;elves in the &s;ucce&s;s of my cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Pa&s;s on me what &s;entence you plea&s;e, Athenians; but I can neither repent nor change my conduct. I mu&s;t not abandon or &s;u&s;pend a function, which God him&s;elf has impo&s;ed on me, &s;ince he has charged me with the care of in&s;tructing my fellow-citizens. If, after having faithfully kept all the ports, wherein I was placed by our generals, the fear of death &s;hould at this time make me abandon that in which the Divine Providence has placed me, by commanding me to pa&s;s my life in the &s;tudy of philo&s;ophy, for the in&s;truction of my&s;elf and others; this would be a mo&s;t criminal de&s;ertion indeed, and make me highly worthy of being cited before this tribunal, as an impious man who does not believe the gods.</P>

I am reproached with abject fear and meanne&s;s of &s;pirit, for being &s;o bu&s;y in im|parting my advice to every one in private, and for having always avoided to be pre&s;ent in your a&s;&s;emblies, to give my coun&s;els to my country. I think I have &s;ufficiently proved my courage and fortitude, both in the field, where I have borne arms with you, and in the Senate, when I alone, upon more than one occa|&s;ion, oppo&s;ed the violent and cruel orders of the thirty tyrants. What is it then that has prevented me from appearing in your a&s;&s;emblies? It is that demon, that voice divine, which you have &s;o often heard me men|tion, and Melitus has taken &s;o much pains to ridicule.</P>
<P>That &s;pirit has attached it&s;elf to me from my infancy: it is a voice, which I never hear, but when it would prevent me from per&s;i&s;ting in &s;omething I have re&s;olved; for it never exhorts me to undertake any thing. It is the &s;ame being that has always oppo&s;ed me, when I would have intermeddled in the affairs of the republic; and that with the greate&s;t rea&s;on; for I &s;hould have been among&s;t the dead long ago, had I been concerned in the mea&s;ures of the &s;tate, without effecting any thing to the advantage of my&s;elf, or our country.</P>
<P>Do not take it ill, I be&s;eech you, if I &s;peak my thoughts without di&s;gui&s;e, and with truth and freedom. Every man who would generou&s;ly oppo&s;e a whole peo|ple, either among&s;t us or el&s;ewhere, and who inflexibly applies him&s;elf to prevent the violation of the laws, and the practice of iniquity in a government, will never do &s;o long with impunity. It is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for him, who would contend for ju&s;tice, if he has any thoughts of living, to remain in a private &s;tation, and never to have any &s;hare in public affairs.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="031827_0123_0FEEC46F66125A68">For the re&s;t, Athenians, if, in the extreme danger I now am, I do not imitate the behavior of tho&s;e, who, upon le&s;s emergencies, have implored and &s;upplicated their judges with tears, and have brought forth their children, relations, and friends, it is not through pride or ob&s;tinacy, or any contempt for you; but &s;olely for your honor, and for that of the whole city. At my age, and with the reputation, true or fal&s;e, which I have, would it be con&s;i&s;tent for me, after all the le&s;|&s;ons I have given upon the contempt of death, to be afraid of it my&s;elf, and to belie in my la&s;t action all the principles and &s;entiments of my pa&s;t life?</P>
<P>But without &s;peaking of my fame, which I &s;hould extremely injure by &s;uch a conduct, I do not think it allowable to entreat a judge, nor to be ab&s;olved by &s;up|plications: he ought to be per&s;uaded and convinced. The judge does not &s;it upon the bench to &s;how favor by violating the laws; but to do ju&s;tice in conforming to them. He does not &s;wear to di&s;charge with impu|nity whom he plea&s;es; but to do ju&s;tice where it is due. We ought not therefore to accu&s;tom you to perjury, nor you to &s;uffer your&s;elves to be accu&s;tomed to it; for in &s;o doing, both the one and the other of us equally injure ju&s;tice and religion, and both are criminals.</P>
<P>Do not therefore expect from me, Athenians, that I &s;hould have recour&s;e to means which I believe nei|ther hone&s;t nor lawful; e&s;pecially upon this occa&s;ion, wherein I am accu&s;ed of impiety by Melitus. For, if I &s;hould influence you by my prayers, and thereby induce you to violate your oaths, it would be unde|niably evident, that I teach you not to believe in the gods; and even in defending and ju&s;tifying my&s;elf, &s;hould furni&s;h my adver&s;aries with arms again&s;t me, and prove that I believe no divinity. But I am very far from &s;uch wicked thoughts. I am more convinced of the exi&s;tence of God than my accu&s;ers; and &s;o con|vinced, that I abandon my&s;elf to God and you, that you may judge of me as you &s;hall think it be&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>MR. SHERIDAN'S SPEECH, AGAINST MR. TAYLOR.</HEAD>
<P>WE have this day been honored with the coun|&s;els of a complete gradation of lawyers. We have received the opinion of a Judge, of an Attorney-General, of an Ex-Attorney-General, and of a prac|ti&s;ing Barri&s;ter. I agree with the learned gentleman in his admiration of the abilities of my honorable friend, Mr. Fox. What he has &s;aid of his quickne&s;s and of his profoundne&s;s, of his boldne&s;s and his candor, is literally ju&s;t and true, which the mental accompli&s;h|ment of my honorable friend is, on every occa&s;ion, cal|culated to extort even from his adver&s;aries.</P>
<P>The learned gentleman has, however, in this in&s;idi|ous eulogium, connected &s;uch qualities of mind with tho&s;e he has prai&s;ed and venerated, as to convert his encomiums into reproach, and his tributes of prai&s;e into cen&s;ure and invective. The boldne&s;s he has de|&s;cribed is only craft, and his candor, hypocri&s;y. Upon what ground<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> does the learned gentleman connect tho&s;e a&s;&s;emblages of great qualities and of cardinal defects? Upon what principles either of ju&s;tice or of equity does he exult with one hand, whil&s;t he in&s;idiou&s;ly reprobates and de&s;troys with the other?</P>
<P>If the wolf is to be feared, the learned gentleman may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, it will be the wolf in &s;heep's clothing, the ma&s;ked pretender to patrioti&s;m. It is not from the fang of the lion, but from the tooth of the &s;erpent, that reptile which in&s;idiou&s;ly &s;teals upon the vitals of the con&s;titution, and gnaws it to the heart ere the mi&s;|chief is &s;u&s;pected, that de&s;truction is to be feared.</P>
<P>With regard to the acqui&s;ition of a learned gentle|man, Mr. Taylor, who has declared that he means to vote with us this day&punc; I am &s;orry to acknowledge, that from the declaration he has made at the beginning of his &s;peech, I &s;ee no great rea&s;on to boa&s;t of &s;uch an auxiliary. The learned gentleman, who has with p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|culiar

mode&s;ty &s;tyled him&s;elf a <HI>chicken lawyer,</HI> has de|clared, that, thinking us in the right with re&s;pect to the &s;ubject of this day's di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, he &s;hall vote with us; but he has at the &s;ame time thought it nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;&s;ert, that he has never before voted differently from the mini&s;ter and his friends, and perhaps he never &s;hall again vote with tho&s;e whom he means to &s;upport this d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">.</P>
<P>It is rather &s;ingular to vote with us, profe&s;&s;edly be|cau&s;e he finds us to be in the right, and, in the very moment that he a&s;&s;igns &s;o good a rea&s;on for changing his &s;ide, to declare, that in all probability he never &s;hall vote with us again. I am &s;orry to find the chicken is a bird of ill omen, and that its augury is &s;o unpropi|tious to our future intere&s;ts. Perhaps it would have been as well, under the&s;e circum&s;tances, that the chick|en had not left the barn-door of the trea&s;ury; but continued &s;ide by &s;ide with the old cock, to pick tho&s;e crumbs of comfort which would doubtle&s;s be dealt out in time, with a liberality proportioned to the fidelity of the feathered tribe.</P>

<HEAD>PART OF CICERO'S ORATION AGAINST CAT|ILINE.</HEAD>
<P>IT is now a long time, con&s;cript fathers, that we have trod amid&s;t the dangers and machinations of this con&s;piracy: but I know not how it comes to pa&s;s, the full maturity of all tho&s;e crimes, and of this long-ripening rage and in&s;olence, has now broken out dur|ing the period of my con&s;ul&s;hip. Should Catiline alone be removed from this powerful band of traitors, it may abate, perhaps, our fears and anxieties for a while; but the danger will &s;till remain, and continue lurking in the veins and vitals of the republic.</P>
<P>For, as men, oppre&s;&s;ed with a &s;evere fit of illne&s;s, and laboring under the raging heat of a fever, are often at fir&s;t &s;eemingly relieved by a draught of cold

water; but afterwards find the di&s;ea&s;e return upon them with redoubled fury; in like manner, this di&s;temper which has &s;eized the commonwealth, ea&s;ed a little by the puni&s;hment of this traitor, will, from his &s;urviving a&s;&s;ociates, &s;oon a&s;&s;ume new force. Wherefore, con|&s;cript fathers, let the wicked retire; let them &s;epa|rate them&s;elves from the hone&s;t; let them rendezvous in one place. In fine, as I have often &s;aid, let a wall be between them and us: let them cea&s;e to lay &s;nares for the con&s;ul in his own hou&s;e; to be&s;et the tribunal of the city praetor; to inve&s;t the &s;enate hou&s;e with armed ru&s;&s;ians, and to prepare: fire-balls and torches for burning the city: in &s;hort, let every man's &s;entiments with regard to the public be in&s;cribed on his forehead.</P>
<P>This I engage for, and promi&s;e, con&s;cript fathers, that by the diligence of the con&s;uls, the weight of your authority, the courage and firmne&s;s of the Roman knights, and the unanimity of all the hone&s;t, Catiline being driven from the city, you &s;hall behold all his trea&s;ons detected, expo&s;ed, cru&s;hed, and puni&s;hed.</P>
<P>With the&s;e omens, Catiline, of all pro&s;perity to the republic, but of de&s;truction to thy&s;elf, and all tho&s;e who have joined them&s;elves with thee in all kinds of parricide&punc; go thy way then to this impious and abomi|nable war: whil&s;t thou, Jupiter, who&s;e religion was e&s;tabli&s;hed with the foundation of this city, whom we truly call Stator, the &s;tay and prop of this empire, wilt drive this man and his accomplices from thy altars and temples, from the hou&s;es and walls of the city, from the lives and fortunes of us all; and wilt de&s;troy with eternal puni&s;hments, both living and dead, all the haters of good men, the enemies of their country, the plunderers of Italy, now confederated in this dete&s;ta|ble league and partner&s;hip of villany.</P>

<HEAD>SPEECH OF BUONAPARTE, COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE FRENCH ARMY IN ITALY, TO HIS BRETHREN IN ARMS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SOLDIERS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU are precipitated like a torrent from the heights of the Appenines; you have overthrown and di&s;per&s;ed all that dared to oppo&s;e your march. Piedmont, re&s;cued from Au&s;trian tyranny, is left to its natural &s;entiments of regard and friend&s;hip to the French. Milan is yours; and the republican &s;tandard is di&s;played throughout all Lombardy. The dukes of Parma and Modena are indebted for their political ex|i&s;tence only to your genero&s;ity.</P>
<P>The army, which &s;o proudly menaced you, has had no other barrier than its di&s;&s;olution to oppo&s;e your invin|cible courage. The Po, the Te&s;&s;en, the Adda, could not retard you a &s;ingle day. The vaunted bulwarks of Italy were in&s;ufficient. You &s;wept them with the &s;ame rapidity that you did the Appenines. Tho&s;e &s;uc|ce&s;&s;es have carried joy into the bo&s;om of your country. Your repre&s;entatives decreed a fe&s;tival dedicated to your victories, and to be celebrated throughout all the com|munes of the republic. Now your fathers, your moth|ers, your wives, and your &s;i&s;ters, will rejoice in your &s;ucce&s;s, and take pride in their relation to you.</P>
<P>Yes, &s;oldiers, you have done much; but more &s;till remains for you to do. Shall it be &s;aid of us, that we know how to conquer, but not to profit by our victo|ries? Shall po&s;terity reproach us with having found a Capua in Lombardy? But already I &s;ee you fly to arms. You are fatigued with an inactive repo&s;e. You lament the days that are lo&s;t to your glory? Well,
<PB N="136" REF="031827_0134_0FEEC42C50190090">
then, let us proceed; we have other forced marches to make; other enemies to &s;ubdue: more laurels to ac|quire, and more injuries to avenge.</P>
<P>Let tho&s;e who have un&s;heathed the daggers of civil war in France; who have ba&s;ely a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated our mini&s;ters; who have burnt our &s;hips at Toulon; let them tremble! the knell of vengeance has already tolled!</P>
<P>But to quiet the apprehen&s;ions of the people, we declare our&s;elves the friends of all, and particularly of tho&s;e who are the de&s;cendants of Brutus, of Scipio, and tho&s;e other great men whom we have taken for our models.</P>
<P>To re-e&s;tabli&s;h the capitol; to replace the &s;tatues of tho&s;e heroes who have rendered it immortal; to rou&s;e the Roman people entran&s;ed in &s;o many ages of &s;lavery; this &s;hall be the fruit of your victories. It will be an epoch for the admiration of po&s;terity; you will enjoy the immortal glory of changing the a&s;pect of affairs in the fine&s;t part of Europe. The free peo|ple of France, not regardle&s;s of moderation, &s;hall ac|cord to Europe a glorious peace; but it will indemnify it&s;elf for the &s;acrifices of every kind which it has been making for &s;ix years pa&s;t. You will again be re&s;tored to your fire-&s;ides and homes; and your fellow-citizens, pointing you out, &s;hall &s;ay, "There goes one who belonged to the army of Italy!"</P>

<HEAD>REFLECTIONS OVER THE GRAVE OF A YOUNG MAN.</HEAD>
<P>HERE lies the grief of a fond mother, and the bla&s;t|ed expectation of an indulgent father. The youth grew up, like a well-watered plant; he &s;hot deep, ro&s;e high, and bade fair for manhood. But ju&s;t as the cedar began to tower, and promi&s;ed ere long, to be the pride of the wood, and prince among the neigh|boring trees, behold! the axe is laid unto the root;
<PB N="137" REF="031827_0135_0FEEC48A9EF9DEE0">
the fatal blow &s;truck&punc; and all its branching honors tumbled to the du&s;t. And did he fall alone? No: the hopes of his father that begat him, and the plea&s;|ing pro&s;pects of her that bare him, fell, and were cru&s;hed together with him.</P>
<P>Doubtle&s;s it would have pierced one's heart, to have beheld the tender parents following the breathle&s;s youth to his long home. Perhaps drowned in tears, and all overwhelmed with &s;orrows, they &s;tood, like weeping &s;tatues, on this very &s;pot. Methinks I &s;ee the deeply-di&s;tre&s;&s;ed mourners attending the &s;ad &s;olem|nity. How they wring their hands, and pour forth floods from their eyes! Is it fancy? or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o I really hear the pa&s;&s;ionate mother, in an agony of affliction, taking her final leave of the darling of her &s;oul? Dumb &s;he remained, while the awful ob&s;equies were performing; dumb with grief, and leaning upon the partner of her woes. But now the inward angui&s;h &s;truggles for vent; it grows too big to be repre&s;&s;ed. She advances to the brink of the grave. All her &s;oul is in her eyes. She fa&s;tens one more look upon the dear doleful object, before the pit &s;huts its mouth upon him. And as &s;he looks, &s;he cries; in broken accents, interrupted by many a ri&s;ing &s;ob, &s;he cries, Farewel, my &s;on! my &s;on! my only beloved! would to God I had died for thee! Farewel, my child! and farewel all earthly happine&s;s! I &s;hall never more &s;ee good in the land of the living. Attempt not to comfort me. I will go mourning all my days, till my grey hairs come down with &s;orrow to the grave.</P>

<HEAD>SPEECH OF CAIUS CASSIUS TO HIS COLLECT|ED FORCES, AFTER THE DEATH OF CESAR.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SOLDIERS AND FELLOW-CITIZENS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE unju&s;t reproaches of our enemies we could ea&s;ily di&s;prove, if we were not, by our numbers, and by the &s;words which we hold in our hands, in con|dition to de&s;pi&s;e them. While Ce&s;ar led the armies of the republic again&s;t the enemies of Rome, we took part in the &s;ame &s;ervice with him; we obeyed him; we were happy to &s;erve under his command. But when he declared war again&s;t the commonwealth, we became his enemies; and when he became an u&s;urper and a tyrant, we re&s;ented, as an injury, even the fa|vors which he pre&s;umed to be&s;tow upon our&s;elves.</P>
<P>Had he been to fall a &s;acrifice to private re&s;entment, we &s;hould not have been the proper actors in the exe|cution of the &s;entence again&s;t him. He was willing to have indulged us with preferments and honors; but we were not willing to accept, as the gift of a ma&s;ter, what we were entitled to claim as free citizens. We conceived, that, in pre&s;uming to confer the honors of the Roman republic, he encroached on the prerogatives of the Roman people, and in&s;ulted the authority of the Roman &s;enate. Ce&s;ar cancelled the laws, and over|turned the con&s;titution of his country; he u&s;urped all the powers of the commonwealth, &s;et up a monarchy, and him&s;elf affected to be a king. This our ance&s;tors, at the expul&s;ion of Tarquin, bound them&s;elves and their po&s;terity, by the mo&s;t &s;olemn oaths, and by the mo&s;t direful imprecations, never to endure. The &s;ame obligation has been entailed upon us as a debt by our fathers; and we, having faithfully paid and di&s;charged
<PB N="143" REF="031827_0141_0FEEC4DD676B2FC0">
it, have performed the oath, and averted the con&s;e|quences of failure from our&s;elves, and from our po&s;|terity.</P>
<P>In the &s;tation of &s;oldiers, we might have committed our&s;elves, without reflection, to the command of an officer, who&s;e abilities and who&s;e valor we admired; but, in the character of Roman citizens, we have a far different part to &s;u&s;tain. I mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e, that I now &s;peak to the Roman people, and to citizens of a free republic; to men who have never learned to depend upon others for gratifications and favors; who are not accu&s;tomed to own a &s;uperior, but who are them&s;elves the ma&s;ters, the di&s;pen&s;ers of fortune and of honor, and the givers of all tho&s;e dignities and powers by which Ce&s;ar him&s;elf was exalted, and of which he a&s;|&s;umed the entire di&s;po&s;al.</P>
<P>Recollect from whom the Scipios&punc; the Pompeys, and even Ce&s;ar him&s;elf derived his honors; from your an|ce&s;tors, whom you now repre&s;ent, and from your&s;elves, to whom, according to the laws of the republic, we, who are now your leaders in the field, addre&s;s our&s;elves as your fellow-citizens in the commonwealth, and as per&s;ons depending on your plea&s;ure for the ju&s;t reward and retribution of our &s;ervices. Happy in being able to re&s;tore to you what Ce&s;ar had the pre&s;umption to appropriate to him&s;elf, the power and the dignity of your fathers, with the &s;upreme di&s;po&s;al of all the of|fices of tru&s;t that were e&s;tabli&s;hed for your &s;afety, and for the pre&s;ervation of your freedom; happy in being able to re&s;tore to the tribunes of the Roman people the power of protecting you, and of procuring to every Roman citizen that ju&s;tice, which, under the late u&s;ur|pation of Ce&s;ar, was withheld, even from the &s;acred per&s;ons of tho&s;e magi&s;trates them&s;elves.</P>
<P>An u&s;urper is the common enemy of all good citizens; but the ta&s;k of removing him could be the bu&s;ine&s;s only of a few. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">enate and the Roman people, as &s;oon as it was proper for them to declare their judgment, pronounced their approbation of tho&s;e who were con|cerned
<PB N="144" REF="031827_0142_0FEEC49323F58548">
in the death of Ce&s;ar, by the rewards and the honors which they be&s;towed upon them; and they are now become a prey to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins and murderers; they bleed in the &s;treets, in the temples, in the mo&s;t &s;ecret retreats, and in the arms of their families; or they are di&s;per&s;ed, and fly wherever they hope to e&s;cape the fury of their enemies.</P>
<P>Many are now pre&s;ent before you, happy in your protection, happy in witne&s;&s;ing the zeal which you en|tertain for the commonwealth, for the rights of your fellow-citizens, and for your own. The&s;e re&s;pectable citizens, we tru&s;t, will &s;oon, by your means, be re&s;tor|ed to a condition in which they can enjoy, together with you, all the honors of a free people; concur with you in be&s;towing, and partake with you in receiving, the rewards which are due to &s;uch eminent &s;ervices as you are now engaged to perform.</P>

<HEAD>PART OF MR. ERSKINE'S SPEECH, AGAINST MR. PITT, 1784.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MR. SPEAKER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT becomes us to learn, not from the Mini&s;ter, but from the Throne it&s;elf, whether this country is to be governed by men, in whom the Hou&s;e of Commons can confide, or whether we, the People of England's Repre&s;entatives, are to be the &s;port and football of any junto that may hope to rule over us, by an un&s;een and unexplorable principle of government, utterly unknown to the Con&s;titution. This is the great que&s;tion, to which every public-&s;pirited citizen of this country &s;hould direct his view. A que&s;tion which goes very wide of the policy to be adopted concerning India, about which very wi&s;e and very hone&s;t men, not only might, but have, and did materially differ.</P>
<P>The total removal of all the executive &s;ervants of the crown, while they are in the full enjoyment of the
<PB N="145" REF="031827_0143_0FEEC4E04F9096B0">
confidence of that Hou&s;e, and, indeed, without any other vi&s;ible or avowed cau&s;e of removal, than becau&s;e they do enjoy that confidence; and the appointment of others in their room, without any other apparent ground of &s;election than becau&s;e they enjoy it not, is, in my mind, a mo&s;t alarming and portentous attack on the public freedom; becau&s;e, though no outward form of the government is relaxed or violated by it, &s;o as in&s;tantly to &s;upply the con&s;titutional remedy of oppo|&s;ition, the whole &s;pirit and energy of the government is annihilated by it.</P>
<P>If the Right Honorable Gentleman retain his own opin|ions, and if the Hou&s;e likewi&s;e retain its own, is it not evident that he came into office without the mo&s;t di&s;|tant pro&s;pect of &s;erving the public? Is it not evident that he has brought on a &s;truggle between executive and legi&s;lative authority, at a time when they are pointing with equal vigor, unity, and effect, to the common intere&s;ts of the nation?</P>
<P>The Right Honorable Gentleman may imagine that I take plea&s;ure in making the&s;e ob&s;ervations. If &s;o, I can a&s;&s;ure him, upon my honor, that it is far from be|ing the ca&s;e. So very far the contrary, that the incon|veniencies which the country &s;uffers at this moment, from the want of a &s;ettled government, are greatly heightened to my feelings, from the reflection that they are increa&s;ed by his unguided ambition.</P>
<P>Our fathers were friends; and I was taught, from my infancy, to reverence the name of Pitt; an original partiality, which, in&s;tead of being dimini&s;hed, was &s;trongly confirmed by an acquaintance with the Right Honorable Gentleman him&s;elf, which I was cultivating with plea&s;ure, when he was taken from his profe&s;&s;ion into a different &s;cene. Let him not think that I am the le&s;s his friend, or the mean envier of his talents, becau&s;e they have been too much the topic of pane|gyric here already, and both I and the public are now reaping the bitter fruits of the&s;e intemperate prai&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="031827_0144_0FEEC494AB42FF38">"It is good," &s;aid Jeremiah, "for a man to bear the yoke in his youth;" and if the Right Honorable Gentleman had attended to this maxim, he would not, at &s;o early a period, have declared again&s;t a &s;ubordinate &s;ituation; but would have lent the aid of his faculties to carry on the affairs of this country, which wanted nothing but &s;tability to render them glorious, in&s;tead of &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ting up at once for him&s;elf to be the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>How very different has been the progre&s;s of my honorable friend who &s;its near me; who was not hatched at once into a mini&s;ter, by the heat of his own ambition; but who, as it was good for him to do, in the words of the prophet, "bore the yoke in his youth;" pa&s;&s;ed through the &s;ubordinate offices, and matured his talents, in long and laborious oppo&s;itions; arriving, by the natural progre&s;s of his powerful mind, to a &s;upe|riority of political wi&s;dom and comprehen&s;ion, which this Hou&s;e had long, with delight and &s;atisfaction, ac|knowledged.</P>

<P>The&s;e evils are, however, imputed, by the Right Honorable Gentleman and his colleagues, to another &s;ource; to the bill for the regulation of the Ea&s;t In|dies; from the mi&s;chiefs of which they had &s;tepped forth to &s;ave the country; a language mo&s;t indecent in this Hou&s;e of Commons, which thought it their duty to the public to pa&s;s it by a majority of above one hun|dred; but which was, however, to be taken to be de|&s;tructive and dangerous, notwith&s;tanding that author|ity; becau&s;e it had been di&s;approved by a majority of eighteen votes in the Hou&s;e of Lords.

<HEAD>EXTRACT FROM PRESIDENT WASHINGTON'S ADDRESS TO THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES.
<DATE>SEPT. 17, 1796.</DATE></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>FRIENDS AND FELLOW-CITIZENS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE period for a new election of a citizen to ad|mini&s;ter the executive government of the United States, being not far di&s;tant; and the time actually arrived, when your thoughts mu&s;t be employed in de|&s;ignating the per&s;on, who is to be clothed with that important tru&s;t, it appears to me proper, e&s;pecially as it may conduce to a more di&s;tinct expre&s;&s;ion of the public voice, that I &s;hould now appri&s;e you of the re&s;|olution I have formed, to decline being con&s;idered among the number of tho&s;e, out of whom a choice is to be made.</P>
<P>I beg you, at the &s;ame time, to do me the ju&s;tice to be a&s;&s;ured, that this re&s;olution has not been taken, without a &s;trict regard to all the con&s;iderations apper|taining to the relation, which binds a dutiful citizen to his country; and that, in withdrawing the tender of &s;ervice which &s;ilence in my &s;ituation might imply, I am influenced by no diminution of zeal for your future intere&s;t; no deficiency of grateful re&s;pect for your pa&s;t kindne&s;s; but am &s;upported by a full conv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that the &s;tep is compatible with both.</P>
<P>The acceptance of, and continuance hitherto in the office to which your &s;uffrages have twice called me, have been a uniform &s;acrifice of inclination to the opin|ion of duty, and to a deference for what appeared to be your de&s;ire. I con&s;tantly hoped, that it would have been much earlier in my power, con&s;i&s;tently with mo|tives,
<PB N="148" REF="031827_0146_0FEEC4978B380648">
which I was not at liberty to di&s;regard, to return to that retirement from which I had been reluctantly drawn. The &s;trength of my inclination to do this, previous to the la&s;t election, had even led to the prep|aration of an addre&s;s to declare it to you; but mature reflection on the then perplexed and critical po&s;ture of our affairs with foreign nations, and the unanimous ad|vice of per&s;ons entitled to my confidence, impelled me to abandon the idea.</P>
<P>I rejoice, that the &s;tate of your concerns, external as well as internal, no longer renders the pur&s;uit of inclination incompatible with the &s;entiment of duty, or propriety; and am per&s;uaded, whatever partiality may be retained for my &s;ervices, that in the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances of our country, you will not di&s;approve my determination to retire.</P>
<P>The impre&s;&s;ions, with which I fir&s;t undertook the arduous tru&s;t, were explained on the proper occa&s;ion. In the di&s;charge of this tru&s;t, I will only &s;ay, that I have with good intentions contributed towards the or|ganization and admini&s;tration of the government, the be&s;t exertions of which a very fallible judgment was capable. Not uncon&s;cious, in the out&s;et, of the infe|riority of my qualifications, experience in my own eyes, perhaps &s;till more in the eyes of others, has &s;trength|ened the motives to diffidence of my&s;elf: and every day the increa&s;ing weight of years admoni&s;hes me more and more, that the &s;hade of retirement is as nece&s;&s;ary to me as it will be welcome. Satisfied that if any cir|cum&s;tances have given peculiar value to my &s;ervices, they were temporary, I have the con&s;olation to believe, that while choice and prudence invite me to quit the political &s;cene, patrioti&s;m does not forbid it.</P>
<P>In looking forward to the moment, which is intend|ed to terminate the career of my public life, my feel|ings do not permit me to &s;u&s;pend the deep acknowl|edgment of that debt of gratitude which I owe to my beloved country, for the many honors it has conferred upon me; &s;till more for the &s;tedfa&s;t confidence with
<PB N="149" REF="031827_0147_0FEEC4E4F6085238">
which it has &s;upported me; and for the opportunities I have thence enjoyed of manife&s;ting my inviolable at|tachment, by &s;ervices faithful and per&s;evering, though in u&s;efulne&s;s unequal to my zeal. If benefits have re|&s;ulted to our country from the&s;e &s;ervices, let it always be remembered to your prai&s;e, as an in&s;tructive exam|ple in our annals, that under circum&s;tances in which the pa&s;&s;ions, agitated in every direction, were liable to mi&s;lead; amid&s;t appearances &s;ometimes dubious; vici&s;|&s;itudes of fortune often di&s;couraging; in &s;ituations in which, not unfrequently, want of &s;ucce&s;s has counte|nanced the &s;pirit of critici&s;m; the con&s;tancy of your &s;upport was the e&s;&s;ential prop of the efforts, and a guarantee of the plans by which they were effected.</P>
<P>Profoundly penetrated with this idea, I &s;hall carry it with me to my grave, as a &s;trong incitement to uncea&s;|ing vows that Heaven may continue to you the choice&s;t tokens of its beneficence; that your union and broth|erly affection may be perpetual; that the free con&s;ti|tution, which is the work of your hands, may be &s;a|credly maintained; that its admini&s;tration in every de|partment may be &s;tamped with wi&s;dom and virtue; that, in fine, the happine&s;s of the people of the&s;e States, under the au&s;pices of liberty, may be made complete, by &s;o careful a pre&s;ervation and &s;o prudent a u&s;e of this ble&s;&s;ing as will acquire to them the glory of recom|mending it to the applau&s;e, the affection, and adoption of every nation which is yet a &s;tranger to it.</P>
<P>Though in reviewing the incidents of my admini&s;|tration, I am uncon&s;cious of intentional error; I am neverthele&s;s too &s;en&s;ible of my defects not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors. Whatever they may be, I fervently be&s;eech the Al|mighty to avert or mitigate the evils to which they tend. I &s;hall al&s;o carry with me the hope that my country will never cea&s;e to view them with indulgence; and after forty-five years of my life dedicated to its &s;er|vice, with an upright zeal, the faults of incompetent
<PB N="150" REF="031827_0148_0FEEC49A64DC0900">
abilities will be con&s;igned to oblivion, as my&s;elf mu&s;t &s;oon be to the man&s;ions of re&s;t.</P>
<P>Relying on its kindne&s;s in this as in other things; and actuated by that fervent love towards it, which is &s;o natural to a man who views in it the native &s;oil of him&s;elf and his progenitors for &s;everal generations, I anticipate with plea&s;ing expectation that retreat, in which I promi&s;e my&s;elf to realize, without alloy, the &s;weet enjoyment of partaking, in the mid&s;t of my fel|low-citizens, the benign influence of good laws under a free government; the ever favorite object of my heart, and the happy reward, as I tru&s;t, of our mutual cares, labors, and dangers,</P>

Ten thou&s;and dol|lars drawn in a lottery; already two thirds &s;pent. A title to nobility derived from the grand&s;on of an aunt of '&s;quire Thorn, from '&s;quire Thorn's hor&s;e, or per|haps from &s;ome monkey, that has been a favorite play|mate with the prince of Wales.

Deprived of every thing, you have &s;upplied every thing. You have won battles without cannon; made forced marches without &s;hoes; watched without brandy, and often without bread. The republican phalanxes, the &s;oldiers of liberty were alone capable of &s;uffering what you have &s;uffered.</P>
<P>Thanks be to you, &s;oldiers. The grateful country will, in part, be indebted to you for her pro&s;perity; and if, when victorious at Toulon, you predicted the immortal campaign of 1794, your pre&s;ent victories will be the pre&s;ages of more brilliant victories. The two armies, which attacked you with audacity, fly di&s;heart|ened before you. Men, who &s;miled at your mi&s;ery, and rejoiced in thought at the idea of the triumphs of your enemies, are confounded and appalled. But it mu&s;t not, &s;oldiers, be concealed from you, that you have done <HI>nothing,</HI> &s;ince <HI>&s;omething</HI> remains yet to be done. Neither Turin nor Milan are in your power. The a&s;hes of the conquerors of the Tarquins are &s;till di&s;graced by the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins of Ba&s;&s;eville.

<P>Soldiers, the country has a right to expect great things from you; ju&s;tify her expectations. The great|e&s;t ob&s;tacles are undoubtedly overcome; but you have &s;till battles to fight, cities to take, rivers to pa&s;s. Is there one among you who&s;e courage is dimini&s;hed?

All of you burn with a de&s;ire to &s;ay on your return to your home, I belonged to the victorious army of Italy.</P>
<P>Friends, I promi&s;e this conque&s;t to you; but there is one condition which you mu&s;t &s;wear to fulfil; it is to re&s;pect the people whom you deliver; to repre&s;s the horrible pillage which &s;ome wretches, in&s;tigated by our enemies, had practi&s;ed. Unle&s;s you do this, you will no longer be the friends, but the &s;courges of the human race; you will no longer form the honor of the French people. They will di&s;avow you. Your victories, your &s;ucce&s;&s;es, the blood of your brethren who died in battle; all, even honor and glory will be lo&s;t. With re&s;pect to my&s;elf; to the generals who po&s;&s;e&s;s your confidence, we &s;hall blu&s;h to command an army without di&s;cipline, and who admit no other law than that of force.</P>

<HEAD>MR. PITT'S SPEECH,
<DATE>NOV. 18, 1777,</DATE>
IN OP|POSITION TO LORD SUFFOLK, WHO PROPOSED TO PARLIAMENT TO EMPLOY THE INDIANS AGAINST THE AMERICANS; AND WHO SAID, IN THE COURSE OF THE DEBATE, THAT "THEY HAD A RIGHT TO USE ALL THE MEANS, THAT GOD AND NATURE HAD PUT INTO THEIR HANDS, TO CONQUER AMERICA."</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM a&s;toni&s;hed to hear &s;uch principles confe&s;&s;ed! I am &s;hocked to hear them avowed in this Hou&s;e, or in this country! Principles, equally uncon&s;titutional, inhuman, and unchri&s;tian!</P>
<P>My lords, I did not intend to have encroached again on your attention; but I cannot repre&s;s my in|dignation. I feel my&s;elf impelled by every duty. My lords, we are called upon as members of this Hou&s;e, as men, as Chri&s;tian men, to prote&s;t again&s;t &s;uch notions &s;tanding near the throne, polluting the ear of Maje&s;ty. "That God and nature put into our hands!" I know not what ideas that lord may entertain of God and nature; but I know, that &s;uch abominable principles are equally abhorrent to religion and humanity.</P>
<P>What! to attribute the &s;acred &s;anction of God and nature to the ma&s;&s;acres of the Indian &s;calping knife! to the cannibal &s;avage, torturing, murdering, roa&s;ting, and eating; literally, my lords, <HI>eating</HI> the mangled victims of his barbarous battles! Such horrible notions &s;hock every precept of religion, divine or natural, and every generous &s;eeling of humanity. And, my lords, they &s;hock every &s;entiment of honor; they &s;hock me as a lover of honorable war, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a dete&s;ter of murder|ous barbarity.</P>
<P>The&s;e abominable principles, and this more abominable avowal of them, demand the mo&s;t deci&s;ive indignation. I call upon that Right Reverend Bench, tho&s;e holy
<PB N="157" REF="031827_0155_0FEEC4F438575ED0">
mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel, and pious pa&s;tors of our Church: I conjure them to join in the holy work, and vindicate the religion of their God. I appeal to the wi&s;dom and the law of this <HI>learned bench,</HI> to defend and &s;upport the ju&s;tice of their country. I call upon the bi&s;hops, to interpo&s;e the un&s;ullied &s;anctity of their <HI>lawn</HI>; upon the learned judges, to interpo&s;e the purity of their <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rmine,</HI> to &s;ave us from this pollution. I call upon the honor of your lord&s;hips, to reverence the dignity of your ance&s;tors, and to maintain your own. I call upon the &s;pirit and humanity of my country, to vindi|cate the national character. I invoke the genius of the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>From the tape&s;try that adorns the&s;e walls, the im|mortal ance&s;tor of this noble lord frowns with indigna|tion at the di&s;grace of his country. In vain he led your victorious fleets again&s;t the boa&s;ted armada of Spain; in vain he defended and e&s;tabli&s;hed the honor, the liberties, the religion, the prote&s;tant religion of this country, again&s;t the arbitrary cruelties of popery and the inqui&s;ition, if the&s;e more than popi&s;h cruelties and inqui&s;itorial practices are let loo&s;e among us; to turn forth into our &s;ettlements, among our ancient connex|ions, friends, and relations, the mercile&s;s cannibal, thir&s;ting for the blood of man, woman, and child! to &s;end forth the infidel &s;avage&mdash;again&s;t whom? again&s;t your prote&s;tant brethren; to lay wa&s;te their country; to de&s;olate their dwellings, and extirpate their race and name, with the&s;e horrible hell-hounds of &s;avage war!</P>
<P>Spain armed her&s;elf with blood-hounds, to extirpate the wretched natives of America; and we improve on the inhuman example even of Spani&s;h cruelty. We turn loo&s;e the&s;e &s;avage hell-hounds again&s;t our brethren and countrymen in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">erica, of the &s;ame language, laws, liberties, and religion; endeared to us by every tie that &s;hould &s;anctify humanity.</P>
<P>My lords, this awful &s;ubject, &s;o important to our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or, our con&s;titution, and our religion, demands the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> and effectual inquiry. And I again call
<PB N="158" REF="031827_0156_0FEEC4A760609AD0">
upon your lord&s;hips, and the united powers of the &s;tate, to examine it thoroughly, and deci&s;ively, and to &s;tamp upon it an indelible &s;tigma of the public abhor|rence. And I again implore tho&s;e holy prelates of our religion, to do away the&s;e iniquities from among us. Let them perform a lu&s;tration; let them purify this Hou&s;e, and this country from this &s;in.</P>
<P>My lords, I am old and weak, and at pre&s;ent una|ble to &s;ay more; but my feelings and indignation were too &s;trong to have &s;aid le&s;s. I could not have &s;lept this night in my bed, nor repo&s;ed my head on my pillow, without giving this vent to my eternal abhorrence of &s;uch prepo&s;terous and enormous principles.</P>

As for government, I'll turn my back to no man. I never flog my &s;cholars; for that mon&s;trous doctrine of whippin children, which has been &s;o long preached and practi&s;ed by our rigid and &s;uper&s;titious forefathers, I have, long &s;ince, exploded. I have a rare knack of <HI>flattering</HI> them into their duty. And this, according to a celebrated Doctor at Philadelphia, who&s;e works I have heard of, though I never read them, is the grand criterion of &s;chool government. It is, landlord, it is the very philo&s;opher's &s;tone. I am told, likewi&s;e, that this &s;ame great Doctor does not believe that Solo|mon and others really meant <HI>lickin,</HI> in the proper &s;en&s;e of the word, when they talked &s;o much about u&s;ing the rod, &amp;c.

<PB N="160" REF="031827_0158_0FEEC4A8E7FC63A0">
the latter part of his time, that he had the frontery to demand <HI>ten dollars</HI> a month, and his board. And he might truly be &s;aid to rule with a rod of iron; for he kept an <HI>ir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">wood</HI> cudgel in his &s;chool, four feet long; and it was enough to chill one's blood to hear the &s;hrieks of the little innocents, which were cau&s;ed by his barbarity. I have heard my wife &s;ay, that Sue Go&s;&s;ip told her, that &s;he has &s;een the marks of his la&s;hes on the back of her neighbor Rymple's &s;on Darling, for twelve hours after the drubbing. At lea&s;t, the boy told her with his own mouth, that they <HI>might</HI> be &s;een, if they would only take the trouble to &s;trip his &s;hirt off. And, be&s;ides, Ma&s;ter Ignoramus, he was the mo&s;t niggardly of all the human race. I don't &s;uppo&s;e that my bar-room was one dollar the richer for him, in the cour&s;e of the whole time which he tarried with us. While the young people of the town were recreating them&s;elves, and taking a &s;ociable gla&s;s of an evening at my hou&s;e, the &s;tupid blockhead was et<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rnally in his chamber, poring over his mu&s;ty books. But finally he did the job for him&s;elf, and I am rejoiced. The wretch had the dacity to box little Sammy Puney's ears at &s;uch an intolerable rate, that his parents fear the poor child will be an idiot all the days of his life. And all this, for nothing more, than, partly by de&s;ign, and partly through mere accident, he happened to &s;pit in his ma&s;|ter's face. The child being nephew to the &s;quire, you may well &s;uppo&s;e, that the whole neighborhood was &s;oon in an uproar. The indignation of the mother, father, aunts, uncles, cou&s;ins, and indeed the whole cir|cle of acquaintance, was rou&s;ed; and the poor fellow was hooted out of town in le&s;s than twenty-four hours.</P>

<SPEAKER>Schoolm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gentlemen, I will give you a &s;hort hi&s;tory of my life. From &s;even, to fifteen years of age, I went to &s;chool perhaps as much as one year. In which time I went through Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">worth's Spelling-Book, the P&s;alter, the New-Te&s;tament; and could read the new&s;paper without &s;pelling more than half the words. By this time, feeling a little above the common level, I enli&s;ted a &s;oldier in the army, where I continued &s;ix years; and made &s;uch proficiency in the military art, that I was frequently talked of for a corporal. I had likewi&s;e larn'd to write con&s;iderably, and to cypher as fur as Divi&s;ion. The multiplication table I had at my tongue's end, and have not forgot it to this day. At length, receiving a &s;evere flogging for nothing at all, I am not a&s;hamed to own that I de&s;erted, and went into one of the back &s;ettlements, and offered my&s;elf as a teacher. I was immediately employed in that &s;ervice; and, though I am obliged to &s;ay it my&s;elf, I do a&s;&s;ure you I &s;oon became very famous. Since that time, which is eleven years, I have followed the bu&s;ine&s;s con&s;tantly; at lea&s;t, every winter; for in the &s;ummer, it is not cu&s;tomary in the towns in general, to continue a man's &s;chool. One thing I would not forget to men|tion; and that is, I have travelled about the country &s;o much, and been in the army &s;o long (which is allow|ed to be the be&s;t &s;chool in the world) that I con&s;ider my&s;elf as being thoroughly acquainted with mankind. You will not be in&s;en&s;ible, gentlemen, of what great importance this la&s;t acqui&s;ition is, to one who has the care of youth.</P>

<HEAD>EXTRACT FROM MR. PITT'S SPEECH, IN ANSWER TO LORD MANSFIELD, ON THE AFFAIR OF MR. WILKIN, 1770.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THERE is one plain maxim, to which I have in|variably adhered through life; that in every que&s;tion in which my liberty or my property were concerned, I &s;hould con&s;ult and be determined by the dictates of common &s;en&s;e. I confe&s;s, my lords, that I am apt to di&s;tru&s;t the refinements of learning, becau&s;e I have &s;een the able&s;t and the mo&s;t learned men equally liable to deceive them&s;elves, and to mi&s;lead others.</P>
<P>The condition of human nature would be lamenta|ble indeed, if nothing le&s;s than the greate&s;t learning and talents, which fall to the &s;hare of &s;o &s;mall a num|ber of men, were &s;ufficient to direct our judgment and
<PB N="166" REF="031827_0164_0FEEC4B1F48465A0">
our conduct. But Providence has taken better care of our happine&s;s, and given us, in the &s;implicity of com|mon &s;en&s;e, a rule for our direction, by which we &s;hall never be mi&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, my lords, I had no other guide in drawing up the amendment, which I &s;ubmitted to your con&s;id|eration. And before I heard the opinion of the noble lord who &s;poke la&s;t, I did not conceive, that it was even within the limits of po&s;&s;ibility for the greate&s;t hu|man genius, the mo&s;t &s;ubtle under&s;tanding, or the acute&s;t wit, &s;o &s;trangely to mi&s;repre&s;ent my meaning; and to give it an interpretation &s;o entirely foreign from what I intended to expre&s;s, and from that &s;en&s;e, which the very terms of the amendment plainly and di&s;tinctly carry with them.</P>
<P>If there be the &s;malle&s;t foundation for the cen&s;ure thrown upon me by that noble lord; if, either expre&s;s|ly or by the mo&s;t di&s;tant implication, I have &s;aid or in|&s;inuated any part of what the noble lord has charged me with, di&s;card my opinions forever; di&s;card the motion with contempt.</P>
<P>My lords, I mu&s;t beg the indulgence of the Hou&s;e. Neither will my health permit me, nor do I pretend to be qualified, to follow that learned lord minutely through the whole of his argument. No man is better acquainted with his abilities and learning, nor has a greater re&s;pect for them, than I have. I have had the plea&s;ure of &s;itting with him in the other Hou&s;e, and always li&s;tened to him with attention. I have not now lo&s;t a word of what he &s;aid, nor did I ever. Upon the pre&s;ent que&s;tion, I meet him without fear.</P>
<P>The evidence, which truth carries with it, is &s;upe|rior to all arguments; it neither wants the &s;upport, nor dreads the oppo&s;ition of the greate&s;t abilities. If there be a &s;ingle word in the amendment to ju&s;tify the interpretation, which the noble lord has been plea&s;ed to give it, I am ready to renounce the whole. Let it be read, my lords; let it &s;peak for it&s;elf. In what in&s;tance does it interfere with the privileges of the
<PB N="167" REF="031827_0165_0FEEC5088AECFF40">
Hou&s;e of Commons? In what re&s;pect does it que&s;tion their juri&s;diction, or &s;uppo&s;e an authority in this Hou&s;e to arraign the ju&s;tice of their &s;entence?</P>
<P>I am &s;ure that every lord who heers me, will bear me witne&s;s that I &s;aid not one word touching the merits of the Middle&s;ex election. Far from conveying any opinion upon that matter in the amendment, I did not, even in di&s;cour&s;e, deliver my own &s;entiments upon it. I did not &s;ay that the Hou&s;e of Commons had done either right or wrong; but when his Maj|e&s;ty was plea&s;ed to recommend it to us to cultivate unanimity among&s;t our&s;elves, I thought it the duty of this Hou&s;e, as the great hereditary council of the crown, to &s;tate to his Maje&s;ty the di&s;tracted condition of his dominions, together with the events which had de&s;troyed unanimity among his &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>But, my lords, I &s;tated tho&s;e events merely as facts, without the &s;malle&s;t addition either of cen&s;ure or of opinion. They are facts, my lords, which I am not only convinced are true, but which I know are indi&s;|putably true.</P>
<P>Do they not tell us, in &s;o many words, that Mr. Wilkes, having been expelled, was thereby rendered incapable of &s;erving in that parliament? and is it not their re&s;olution alone, which refu&s;es to the &s;ubject his common right? The amendment &s;ays farther, that the electors of Middle&s;ex are deprived of their free choice of a repre&s;entative. Is this a fact, my lords? or have I given an unfair repre&s;entation of it? Will any man pre&s;ume to affirm that Colonel Luttrell is the free choice of the electors of Middle&s;ex? We all know the contrary.</P>
<P>We all know that Mr. Wilkes (whom I mention without either prai&s;e or cen&s;ure) was the favorite of the county, and cho&s;en, by a very great and acknowl|edged majority, to repre&s;ent them in parliament. If the noble lord di&s;likes the manner in which the&s;e facts are &s;tated, I &s;hall think my&s;elf happy in being advi&s;ed by him how to alter it. I am very little anxious about
<PB N="168" REF="031827_0166_0FEEC4B90EDA1FC0">
terms, provided the &s;ub&s;tances be pre&s;erved; and the&s;e are facts, my lords, which I am &s;ure will always retain their weight and importance, in whatever form of lan|guage they are de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>The con&s;titution of this country has been openly in|vaded in fact; and I have heard, with horror and a&s;ton|i&s;hment, that very inva&s;ion defended upon principle. What is this my&s;terious power, undefined by law, un|known to the &s;ubject; which we mu&s;t not approach without awe, nor &s;peak of without reverence; which no man may que&s;tion, and to which all men mu&s;t &s;ub|mit? My lords, I thought the &s;lavi&s;h doctrine of pa&s;|&s;ive obedience had long &s;ince been exploded: and, when our kings were obliged to confe&s;s that their title to the crown, and the rule of their government, had no other foundation than the known laws of the land, I never expected to hear a divine right, or a divine in|fallibility, attributed to any other branch of the legi&s;|lature.</P>
<P>My lords, I beg to be under&s;tood. No man re&s;pects the Hou&s;e of Commons more than I do, or would con|tend more &s;trenuou&s;ly than I would, to pre&s;erve to them their ju&s;t and legal authority. Within the bounds pre&s;cribed by the con&s;titution, that authority is nece&s;&s;ary to the well-being of the people: beyond that line, every exertion of power is arbitrary, is ille|gal; it threatens tyranny to the people, and de&s;truc|tion to the State. Power without right is the mo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ous and dete&s;table object that can be offered to the human imagination: it is not only pernicious to tho&s;e who are &s;ubject to it, but tends to its own de&s;truction.</P>

<P>YOU have now two wars before you, of which you mu&s;t choo&s;e one, for both you cannot &s;upport.

<P><PB N="173" REF="031827_0171_0FEEC5112F872CE0">My opinion is for withdrawing your forces from America entirely; for a defen&s;ive war you can never think of there. A defen&s;ive war would ruin this nation at any time; and in any circum&s;tances, offen&s;ive war is pointed out as proper for this country; our &s;ituation points it out; and the &s;pirit of the nation impels us to attack rather than defend.

The nature of the wars is quite dif|ferent&punc; the war again&s;t America is again&s;t your own countrymen; you have &s;topped me from &s;aying again&s;t your fellow-&s;ubjects; that again&s;t France is again&s;t your inveterate enemy and rival. Every blow you &s;trike in America is again&s;t your&s;elves; it is again&s;t all idea of reconciliation, and again&s;t your own intere&s;t, though you &s;hould be able, as you never will be, to force them to &s;ubmit. Every &s;troke again&s;t France is of advantage to you: America mu&s;t be conquered in France; France never can be conquered in America.</P>
<P>The war of the Americans is a war of pa&s;&s;ion; it is of &s;uch a nature as to be &s;upported by the mo&s;t powerful virtues, love of liberty and of their country; and, at the &s;ame time, by tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> human heart which give courage, &s;trength, and per&s;everance to man; the &s;pirit of revenge for the injuries you have done them; of retaliation for the hard&s;hips you have inflicted on them; and of oppo&s;ition to the unju&s;t powers you have exerci&s;ed over them. Every thing combines to animate them to this war, and &s;uch a war is without end; for whatever ob&s;tinacy, enthu&s;ia&s;m ever in&s;pired man with, you will now find in America.

Whil&s;t the advantages &s;he promi&s;es her&s;elf are remote and uncertain, inflict pre&s;ent evils and di&s;tre&s;&s;es upon her &s;ubjects: the people will become di&s;contented and clamorous; &s;he will find it a bad bargain, having entered into this bu&s;ine&s;s; and you will force her to de&s;ert any ally that brings &s;o much trouble and di&s;tre&s;s upon her.</P>
<P>What is become of the ancient &s;pirit of this nation? Where is the national &s;pirit that ever did honor to this country? Have the pre&s;ent mini&s;try &s;pent that too, with almo&s;t the la&s;t &s;hilling of your money? Are they not a&s;hamed of the temporizing conduct they have u&s;ed towards France? Her corre&s;pondence with America has been clande&s;tine. Compare that with their conduct towards Holland, &s;ome time ago; but it is the charac|teri&s;tic of little minds to be exact in little things, whil&s;t they &s;hrink from their rights in great ones.</P>
<P>The conduct of F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce is called clande&s;tine: look back but a year ago to a letter from one of your Sec|retaries of State to Holland; "it is with &s;urpri&s;e and indignation" your conduct is &s;een, in &s;omething done by a petty governor of an i&s;land, while they affect to call the mea&s;ures of France clande&s;tine. This is the way that mini&s;ters &s;upport the character of the nation, and the national honor and glory. But look again how that &s;ame Holland is &s;poken of to-day. Even in your corre&s;pondence with her your littlene&s;s appears.</P>
<P>From this you may judge of your &s;ituation; from this you may know what a &s;ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e you are reduced to. How will the French party in Holland exult over you, and grow &s;trong! She will never continue your ally, when you meanly crouch to France, and do not dare to &s;tir in your defence! But it is nothing extraordinary that &s;he &s;hould not, while you keep the mini&s;ters you
<PB N="175" REF="031827_0173_0FEEC514239BB900">
have. No power in Europe is blind; there is none blind enough to ally it&s;elf with weakne&s;s, and be|come partner in bankruptcy; there is no one blind enough to ally them&s;elves to ob&s;tinacy, ab&s;urdity, and imbecility.</P>

<P>WHAT a &s;trange man this is, Richard! Did you ever &s;ee a conjurer before?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Richard.</SPEAKER>
<P>There was one travelled this way before your remembrance; but he mi&s;&s;ed his figure very much. I was to have been an officer before this time, accord|ing to his predictions; and you, Jack, were to have had a fine rich young lady for your &s;i&s;ter-in-law. But he was only an apprentice in the art; no more than A, B, C, to this man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, he is ma&s;ter of his trade, I warrant you. I dare &s;ay, when father comes home, he can tell him which way the thief is gone with our old Trot&punc; Uncle Blu&s;ter is coming over here this evening to find out who has got his watch. The conjurer is ju&s;t gone out to look at the &s;tars. I &s;uppo&s;e, after he has viewed them a while, he will ca&s;t a figure in his great black-art book in the other room, and tell in a trice what things are &s;tolen, and where they are, to a hair's breadth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>He mu&s;t have a hawk's eye to &s;ee the &s;tars this evening. Why don't you know, Jack, it is cloudy out a'doors?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's nothing with him. He could look through the clouds with his gla&s;s, if it was as dark as Egypt, as ea&s;y as you can look into the other room&punc; or, if he had a mind, he could bru&s;h away the clouds in a trice with that long wand he carries in his hand.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Think.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is much ea&s;ier to account for the&s;e things than to ju&s;tify them. We &s;hall always act beneath our|&s;elves, while we look up to worthle&s;s wretches as our &s;uperiors. Prince Edward was certainly no more than a man. This conjurer, in my opinion, is much le&s;s: I con&s;ider him beneath contempt. I am as great a friend to mirth as your&s;elf; but it is really mortifying that my friends &s;hould be &s;o anxious to make them|&s;elves the objects of ridicule.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is your old &s;train, Ma&s;ter Thinkwell. I know you are apt to get round me in your arguments; but I believe the conjurer knows much more than both of us.

<P>Have patience; and time, the only true fortune-teller, will di&s;clo&s;e the future, without any pay, fa&s;t enough for your happine&s;s or profit.

<P>I happened to overhear him talking with one of his gang la&s;t evening. This watch, with a num|ber of other articles, was to be hidden in a hollow tree. This impo&s;tor, to maintain the credit of a conjurer, was to inform the owners, on inquiry, where they were, upon their paying him for the impo&s;ition.

<HEAD>EXTRACT FROM MR. PITT'S SPEECH IN THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT,
<DATE>JAN. 20, 1775.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>WHEN your lord&s;hips look at the papers tran&s;|mitted to us from America; when you con|&s;ider their decency, firmne&s;s, and wi&s;dom, you cannot but re&s;pect their cau&s;e, and wi&s;h to make it your own. For my&s;elf, I mu&s;t declare and avow, that in all my reading and ob&s;ervation, (and it has been my favorite &s;tudy: I have read Thucidydes, and have &s;tudied and admired the ma&s;ter-&s;tates of the world:) I &s;ay I mu&s;t declare, that, for &s;olidity of rea&s;oning, force of &s;agacity, and wi&s;dom of conclu&s;ion, under &s;uch a complication of difficult circum&s;tances, no nation, or body of men can &s;tand in preference to the General Congre&s;s at Philadelphia. I tru&s;t it is obvious to your lord&s;hips, that all attempts to impo&s;e &s;ervitude upon &s;uch men, to e&s;tabli&s;h, de&s;poti&s;m over &s;uch a mighty continental na|tion, mu&s;t be vain, mu&s;t be fatal.</P>
<P>We &s;hall be forced, ultimately, to retract, let us retract while we <HI>can,</HI> not when we <HI>mu&s;t.</HI> I &s;ay we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily undo the&s;e violent oppre&s;&s;ive acts. They MUST be repealed. You WILL repeal them. I pledge my&s;elf for it, that you will in the end repeal them. I &s;take my reputation on it. I will con&s;ent to be taken for an idiot, if they are not finally repealed.</P>
<P>Avoid, then, this humiliating, di&s;graceful nece&s;&s;ity. With a dignity becoming your exalted &s;ituation, make
<PB N="185" REF="031827_0183_0FEEC5230EEB4E30">
the fir&s;t advances to concord, to peace and happine&s;s: for it is your true dignity, to act with prudence and ju&s;tice. That <HI>you</HI> &s;hould fir&s;t concede, is obvious from &s;ound and rational policy. Conce&s;&s;ion comes with bet|ter grace, and more &s;alutary effects from &s;uperior pow|er; it reconciles &s;uperiority of power with the feelings of men; and e&s;tabli&s;hes &s;olid confidence on the founda|tions of affection and gratitude.</P>
<P>Every motive, therefore, of ju&s;tice and of policy, of dignity and of prudence, urges you to allay the fer|ment in America, by a removal of your troops from Bo&s;ton; by a repeal of your acts of parliament; and by demon&s;tration of amicable di&s;po&s;itions towards your colonies. On the other hand, every danger and every hazard impend, to deter you from per&s;everance in your pre&s;ent ruinous mea&s;ures. Foreign war hanging over your heads by a &s;light and brittle thread: France and Spain watching your conduct, and waiting for the ma|turity of your errors; with a vigilant eye to America, and the temper of your colonies, more than to their own concerns, be they what th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y may.</P>
<P>To conclude, my lords; if the mini&s;ters thus per&s;e|vere in mi&s;advi&s;ing and mi&s;leading the King, I will not &s;ay&punc; that they can alienate the affections of his &s;ubjects from his crown; but I will affirm, that they will make the crown not worth his wearing: I will not &s;ay that the king is betrayed; but I will pronounce, that the kingdom is undone.</P>

<HEAD>SPEECH OF GALGACHUS TO THE CALEDO|NIAN ARMY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>COUNTRYMEN, AND FELLOW-SOLDIERS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I con&s;ider the cau&s;e, for which we have drawn our &s;words, and the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;triking an effectual blow, before we &s;heath them again, I feel joyful hopes ari&s;ing in my mind, that this day an open|ing will be made for the re&s;toration of Briti&s;h liberty&punc;
<PB N="186" REF="031827_0184_0FEEC4D4A30082A0">
and for &s;haking off the infamous yoke of Roman &s;lavery. Caledonia is yet free. The all-gra&s;ping power of Rome has not yet been able to &s;eize our liberty. But it is to be pre&s;erved only by valor.</P>
<P>You are not to expect to e&s;cape the ravage of the general plunderers of mankind, by any &s;entiment of ju&s;tice in them. When the countries which are more acce&s;&s;ible have been &s;ubdued, they will then force their way into tho&s;e which are harder to be overcome. And if they &s;hould conquer the dry land, over the whole world, they will then think of carrying their arms beyond the ocean, to &s;ee whether there be not certain unknown regions, which they may attack, and reduce under &s;ubjection to the Roman empire.</P>
<P>For we &s;ee that if a country is thought to be power|ful in arms, the Romans attack it becau&s;e the conque&s;t will be glorious; if incon&s;iderable in the military art, becau&s;e the victory will be ea&s;y; if rich, they are drawn thither by the hope of plunder; if poor, by the de&s;ire of fame.</P>
<P>The ea&s;t, and the we&s;t, the &s;outh, and the north, the face of the whole earth is the &s;cene of their military achievements. The world is too little for their ambi|tion, and their avarice. Their &s;upreme joy &s;eems to be ravaging, fighting, and &s;hedding of blood; and when they have unpeopled a region, &s;o that there are none left alive to bear arms, they &s;ay they have given peace to that country.</P>
<P>Our di&s;tance from the &s;eat of government, and our natural defence by the &s;urrounding ocean, render us obnoxious to their &s;u&s;picions: for they know that Britons are born with an in&s;tinctive love of liberty: and they conclude that we mu&s;t naturally be led to think of taking the advantage of our detached &s;ituation, to di&s;engage our&s;elves, one time or another, from their oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Thus, my countrymen, and fellow-&s;oldiers, &s;u&s;pected and hated as we ever mu&s;t be by the Romans, there is no pro&s;pect of our enjoying even a tolerable &s;tate of
<PB N="187" REF="031827_0185_0FEEC52495FAFBD0">
bondage under them. Let us, then, in the name of all that is &s;acred, and in defence of all that is dear to us, re&s;olve to exert our&s;elves, if not for glory, at lea&s;t for &s;afety; if not in vindication of Briti&s;h honor, at lea&s;t in defence of our lives.</P>
<P>But, after all, who are the&s;e mighty Romans? Are they gods; or mortal men, like our&s;elves? Do we not &s;ee that they fall into the &s;ame errors and weak|ne&s;&s;es, as others? Does not peace effeminate them? Does not abundance debauch them? Does not wan|tonne&s;s enervate them? Do they not even go to ex|ce&s;s in the mo&s;t unmanly vices? And can you imagine that they who are remarkable for their vices are like|wi&s;e remarkable for their valor? What then do we dread? Shall I tell you the truth, my fellow-&s;oldiers? It is by means of our inte&s;tine divi&s;ions, that the Ro|mans have gained &s;uch great advantage over us. They turn the mi&s;conduct of their enemies to their own prai&s;e. They boa&s;t of what they have done, and &s;ay nothing of what we might have done, had we been &s;o wi&s;e, as to unite again&s;t them.</P>
<P>What is this formidable Roman army? Is it not compo&s;ed of a mixture of people from different coun|tries; &s;ome more, &s;ome le&s;s capable of bearing fatigue and hard&s;hip? They keep together while they are &s;ucce&s;sful. Attack them with vigor: di&s;tre&s;s them: you will &s;ee them more di&s;united than we are now. Can any one imagine, that Gauls, Germans, and with &s;hame I mu&s;t add, Britons, who ba&s;ely lend their limbs and lives, to build up a foreign tyranny; can one im|agine that the&s;e will be longer enemies than &s;laves? or that &s;uch an army is held together by &s;entiments of fidelity or affection? No: the only bond of union among them is fear. And whenever terror cea&s;es to work upon the minds of that mixed multitude, they who now fear, will then hate their tyrannical ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>On our &s;ide there is every po&s;&s;ible incitement to valor. The Roman courage is not, as ours, inflamed by the thoughts of wives and children in danger of falling in|to
<PB N="188" REF="031827_0186_0FEEC4D77ABCC610">
the hands of the enemy. The Romans have not parents, as we have, to reproach them if they &s;hould de&s;ert their infirm old age. They have no country here to fight for. They are a motley collection of foreigners, in a land wholly unknown to them; cut off from their native country; hemmed in by the &s;ur|rounding ocean; and given, I hope, a prey into our hands, without any po&s;&s;ibility of e&s;cape. Let not the &s;ound of the Roman name affright your ears, nor let the glare of gold or &s;ilver, upon their armour, dazzle your eyes. It is not by gold or &s;ilver, that men are either wounded or defended; though they are ren|dered a richer prey to the conquerors. Let us boldly attack this di&s;united rabble. We &s;hall find among them|&s;elves a reinforcement to our army.</P>
<P>And what will there be then to fear? A few half garri&s;oned forts; a few municipal towns, inhabited by worn-out old men; di&s;cord univer&s;ally prevailing, oc|ca&s;ioned by tyranny in tho&s;e who command, and ob|&s;tinacy in tho&s;e who &s;hould obey. On our &s;ide, an army united in the cau&s;e of their country, their wives, their children, their aged parents, their lives. At the head of this army, I hope I do not offend again&s;t mode&s;ty in &s;aying there is a General ready to exert all his abil|ities, &s;uch as they are, and to hazard his life in leading you to victory, and to freedom.</P>
<P>I conclude, my countrymen and fellow-&s;oldiers, with putting you in mind, that on your behavior this day depends your future enjoyment of peace and lib|erty, or your &s;ubjection to a tyrannical enemy, with all its grievous con&s;equences. When, therefore, you come to engage, think of your ance&s;tors, and think of your po&s;terity.</P>

<P>That I &s;hall leave to your di&s;cretion.

You will find him not deficient in that re&s;pect; though perhaps it requires as much practice to make one perfect in that, as in any art whatever. He has already learned by heart a great number of pieces, and has acted a part in &s;everal comedies and tragedies with much applau&s;e. It has been the cu&s;tom of our ma&s;ter to have an exhibition at lea&s;t once a quarter; and my &s;on has always been con&s;idered as one of his be&s;t performers.

<P>I &s;hall agree to that only under certain limitations. That is an art which undoubtedly demands our &s;olicitous attention; but it ought never to be pur|&s;ued to the injury of other &s;tudies. I am &s;en&s;ible that it is no le&s;s u&s;eful to a pupil than entertaining to an audience, to exerci&s;e him occa&s;ionally on the &s;tage in declaiming judicious and well-written compo&s;itions, and pronouncing &s;uch &s;elected dialogues, as will tend to give gracefulne&s;s to his attitude, and familiarity to his tones and ge&s;tures. But, admitting that time could be &s;pared from more important pur&s;uits, I &s;ee but little <HI>good</HI> re&s;ulting from the exhibition of whole comedies and tragedies in our academies and &s;chools; while much <HI>evil</HI> is to be feared, both from the immorality of the plays, and the di&s;&s;ipation it introduces in &s;ociety. Be&s;ides, all boys are not calculated for orators; and though Demo&s;thenes &s;urmounted almo&s;t in&s;uperable difficulties in the acquirement of his art, it is folly to &s;uppo&s;e that his example is capable of univer&s;al imita|tion. I cannot believe it a very plea&s;ing entertainment to a di&s;cerning audience, to &s;ee a boy without talents, mounted upon the ro&s;trum, <HI>&s;pouting</HI> forth &s;entences which he does not under&s;tand, and which, perhaps, are cho&s;en with as little judgment, as they are deliv|ered with propriety.

<HEAD>THE EXISTENCE OF GOD, DEMONSTRATED FROM THE WORKS OF CREATION; BEING A SERMON PREACHED AT PROVIDENCE, BY JON|ATHAN MAXCY, A. M. PRESIDENT OF RHODE-ISLAND COLLEGE, 1795; FROM ROMANS i.20.</HEAD>
<P>[<HI>N. B.</HI> When found expedient, the following Sermon may conveniently be divided into three or four parts, &s;uitable for declamations. The author of this work did not intend at fir&s;t to in&s;ert the whole; but, in attempting to make a &s;election, he could find no part which he was willing to <HI>leave.</HI>]</P>
<P>NOTHING will more effectually guard us again&s;t vice, than a firm belief in the exi&s;tence of God. For &s;urely if we realize that there is &s;uch a Being, we &s;hall naturally infer from his perfections, from the na|ture of his moral government, and from our &s;ituation as rational creatures, that we are amenable at his awful tribunal. Superior power, wi&s;dom, and goodne&s;s, al|ways lay <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s under re&s;traint, and command our venera|tion. The&s;e, even in a mortal, overawe us. They re&s;train not only the actions, but the words and thoughts of the mo&s;t vicious and abandoned. Our happine&s;s de|pends on our virtue. Our virtue depends on the con|formity of our hearts and conduct to the laws pre&s;cri|bed us by our beneficent Creator.</P>
<P>Of what va&s;t importance then is it to our con&s;ent as well as future felicity, to po&s;&s;e&s;s in our heart<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eling &s;en&s;e, and in our under&s;tandings a clear con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, of the exi&s;tence of that Being who&s;e power and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne&s;s are unbounded, who&s;e pre&s;ence fills immen&s;ity, and who&s;e wi&s;dom, like a torrent of lightning, emanates through all the dark rece&s;&s;es of eternal duration! How great mu&s;t be the effect of a &s;en&s;e of the pre&s;ence of the great Creator and Governor of all things, to whom belong the attributes, eternity, independency, perfect holine&s;s, inflexi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tice, and inviolable veracity; com|plete happine&s;s and glorious maje&s;ty; &s;upreme right and unbounded dominion!</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="031827_0194_0FEEC58C8E263910">A &s;en&s;e of accountability to God will retard the eager pur&s;uit of vice; it will humble the heart of the proud, it will bridle the tongue of the profane, and &s;natch the knife from the hand of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in. A belief of the exi&s;tence of God is the true original &s;ource of all virtue, and the only foundation of all religion, natural or revealed. Set a&s;ide this great luminous truth, era&s;e the conviction of it from the heart, you then place vir|tue and vice on the &s;ame level; you drive afflicted in|nocence into de&s;pair; you add new effrontery to the marred vi&s;age of guilt; you plant thorns in the path, and &s;hed an impenetrable gloom over the pro&s;pects of the righteous.</P>
<P>Sin has alienated the affections, and diverted the at|tention of men from the great Jehovah. "Darkne&s;s has covered the earth, and gro&s;s darkne&s;s the people." Men have wor&s;hipped the works of their own hands, and neglected the true God, though his exi&s;tence and perfections were &s;tamped in glaring characters on all creation. From the regularity, order, beauty, and con|&s;ervation of this great &s;y&s;tem of things, of which man makes a part; from the uniform tendency of all its di|vi&s;ions to their proper ends; the exi&s;tence of God &s;hines as clearly as the &s;un in the heavens. "From the things that are made," &s;ays the text, "are &s;een his eternal power and Godhead."</P>
<P N="1">1. Man him&s;elf is a proof of God's exi&s;tence: Let us place him before us in his full &s;tature. We are at once impre&s;&s;ed with the beautiful organization of his body, with the orderly and harmonious arrangement of his members. Such is the di&s;po&s;ition of the&s;e, that their motion is the mo&s;t ea&s;y, graceful, and u&s;eful, that can be conceived. We are a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee the &s;ame &s;im|ple matter diver&s;ified into &s;o many different &s;ub&s;tances, of different qualities, &s;ize, and figure. If we pur&s;ue our re&s;earches through the internal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">onomy, we &s;hall find, that all the different oppo&s;ite <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s corre&s;pond to each other with the utmo&s;t exactne&s;s and order; that they all an&s;wer the mo&s;t beneficent purpo&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="031827_0195_0FEEC58E13A83A00">This wonderful machine, the human body, is ani|mated, cheri&s;hed, and pre&s;erved, by a &s;pirit within; which pervades every particle, feels in every organ, warns us of injury, and admini&s;ters to our plea&s;ures. Erect in &s;tature, man differs from all other animals. Though his foot is confined to the earth, yet his eye mea&s;ures the whole circuit of heaven, and in an in&s;tant takes in thou&s;ands of worlds. His countenance is turn|ed upward, to teach us that he is not like other animals, limited to the earth, but looks forward to brighter &s;cenes of exi&s;tence in the &s;kies.</P>
<P>Whence came this erect, orderly, beautiful con&s;titu|tion of the human body? Did it &s;pring up from the earth, &s;elf-formed? Surely not. Earth it&s;elf is in|active matter. That which has no motion can never produce any. Man &s;urely could not, as has been vainly and idly &s;uppo&s;ed, have been formed by the for|tuitous concurrence of atoms. We behold the mo&s;t ex|act order in the con&s;titution of the human body. Or|der always involves de&s;ign. De&s;ign always involves intelligence. That intelligence, which directed the orderly formation of the human body, mu&s;t have re&s;i|ded in a Being who&s;e power was adequate to the pro|duction of &s;uch an effect.</P>
<P>Creation &s;urely is the prerogative of a &s;elf-exi&s;tent, uncau&s;ed Being. Finite creatures may arrange and di&s;po&s;e, but they cannot create; they cannot give life. It is a univer&s;al law through all nature, that like pro|duces like. The &s;ame laws mo&s;t probably obtain through the whole &s;y&s;tem in which we are connected. We have therefore no rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that angels created man. Neither can we, without the greate&s;t ab&s;urdity, admit, that he was formed by him&s;elf, or by mere ac|cident. If in the latter way, why do we never &s;ee men formed &s;o in the pre&s;ent day? Why do we never &s;ee the clods of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">th brightening into human fle&s;h, and the du&s;t un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> our feet crawling into animated forms, and &s;tarting up into life and intelligence?</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="031827_0196_0FEEC5362B34D250">If we even admit that either of the forementioned cau&s;es might have produced man, yet neither of them could have pre&s;erved him in exi&s;tence one moment. There mu&s;t therefore be a God uncau&s;ed, independent, and complete. The nobler part of man clearly evinces this great truth. When we con&s;ider the boundle&s;s de|&s;ires and the inconceivable activity of the &s;oul of man, we can refer his origin to nothing but God. How a&s;|toni&s;hing are the rea&s;oning faculties of man! How &s;ur|pri&s;ing the power of comparing, arranging, and con|necting his ideas! How wonderful is the power of im|agination! On its wings, in a moment, we can tran&s;|port our&s;elves to the mo&s;t di&s;tant part of the univer&s;e. We can fly back, and live the lives of all antiquity, or &s;urmount the limits of time, and &s;ail along the va&s;t range of eternity. Whence the&s;e a&s;toni&s;hing powers, if not from a God of infinite wi&s;dom, goodne&s;s, and power?</P>
<P N="2">2. "The invi&s;ible things of him from the creation of the world," &s;ays the text, "are clearly &s;een." Let us for a moment behold our earth. With what a delightful &s;cene are we here pre&s;ented! The diver&s;ifi|cation of its &s;urface into land and water, i&s;lands and lakes, &s;prings and rivers, hills and vallies, mountains and plains, renders it to man doubly enchanting. We are entertained with an agreeable variety, without be|ing di&s;gu&s;ted by a tedious uniformity. Every thing appears admirably formed for our profit and delight. There the vallies are clothed in &s;miling green, and the plains are bending with corn. Here is the gentle hill to delight the eye, and beyond, &s;low ri&s;ing from the earth, &s;wells the huge mountain, and, with all its load of waters, rocks, and woods, heaves it&s;elf up into the &s;kies. Why this plea&s;ing, va&s;t deformity of nature? Undoubtedly for the benefit of man. From the moun|tains de&s;cend &s;treams to fertilize the plains below, and cover them with wealth and beauty&punc;</P>
<P>The earth not only produces every thing nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport our bodies, but to remedy our di&s;ea&s;es, and
<PB N="199" REF="031827_0197_0FEEC537C85A36D0">
gratify our &s;en&s;es. Who covered the earth with &s;uch a plea&s;ing variety of fruits and flowers? Who gave them their delightful fragrance, and painted them with &s;uch exqui&s;ite colors? Who cau&s;es the &s;ame water to whiten in the lily, that blu&s;hes in the ro&s;e? Do not the&s;e things indicate a Cau&s;e infinitely &s;uperior to any finite being? Do they not directly lead us to believe the exi&s;tence of God, to admire his goodne&s;s, to revere his power, to adore his wi&s;dom, in &s;o happily accom|modating our external circum&s;tances to our &s;ituation and internal con&s;titution?</P>
<P N="3">3. But how are we a&s;toni&s;hed to behold the va&s;t ocean, rolling its immen&s;e burden of waters! Who gave it &s;uch a configuration of particles as to render it moveable by the lea&s;t pre&s;&s;ure, and at the &s;ame time &s;o &s;trong as to &s;upport the heavie&s;t weights? Who &s;pread out this va&s;t high-way of all the nations under heaven? Who gave it its regular motion? Who confined it within its bounds? A little more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o|tion would di&s;order the whole world! A &s;mall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|citement on the tide would drown whole kingdom. Who re&s;trains the proud waves, when the tempe&s;t lifts them to the clouds? Who mea&s;ured the great waters, and &s;ubjected them to invariable laws? That great Be|ing, "who placed the &s;and for the bound thereof, by a perpetual decree that it cannot pa&s;s; and though the waves thereof to&s;s them&s;elves, yet can they not prevail; though they roar, yet can they not pa&s;s over." With rea&s;on may we believe, that from the things that are made, are clearly &s;een eternal power and wi&s;dom.</P>
<P N="4">4. Pa&s;&s;ing by the numerous productions and appen|dages of the earth, let us ri&s;e from it, and con&s;ider the body of air with which we are &s;urrounded. What a convincing proof do we here find of the exi&s;tence of God! Such is the &s;ubtilty and tran&s;parency of the air, that it receives the rays of the &s;un and &s;tars, con|veying them with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nconceivable velocity to objects on the earth, rendering them vi&s;ible, and decorating the
<PB N="200" REF="031827_0198_0FEEC541AE9A6798">
whole &s;urface of the globe with an agreeable inter|mixture of light, &s;hade, and colors. But &s;till this air has a &s;ufficient con&s;i&s;tency and &s;trength to &s;upport clouds, and all the winged inhabitants. Had it been le&s;s &s;ub|tile, it would have intercepted the light. Had it been more rarified, it would not have &s;upported its inhab|itants, nor have afforded &s;ufficient moi&s;ture for the pur|po&s;es of re&s;piration. What then but infinite wi&s;dom could have tempered the air &s;o nicely, as to give it &s;uf|ficient &s;trength to &s;upport clouds for rain, to afford wind for health, and at the &s;ame time to po&s;&s;e&s;s the power of conveying &s;ound and light? How wonderful is this element! How clearly does it di&s;cover infinite wi&s;dom, power, and goodne&s;s!</P>
<P N="5">5. But when we ca&s;t our eyes up to the firmament of heaven, we clearly &s;ee that it declares God's handy work. Here the immen&s;e theatre of God's works opens upon us, and di&s;clo&s;es ten thou&s;and magnificent, &s;plen|did objects. We dwindle to nothing in compari&s;on with this augu&s;t &s;cene of beauty, maje&s;ty, and glory. Who reared this va&s;t arch over our heads? Who adorned it with &s;o many &s;hining objects, placed at &s;uch immen&s;e di&s;tances from each other, regular in their motions, invariably ob&s;erving the laws to which they were originally &s;ubjected? Who placed the &s;un at &s;uch a convenient di&s;tance as not to annoy, but refre&s;h us? Who for &s;o many ages has cau&s;ed him to ri&s;e and &s;et at fixed times? Who&s;e hand directs, and who&s;e power re&s;trains him in his cour&s;e, cau&s;ing him to pro|duce the agreeable changes of day and night, as well as the variety of &s;ea&s;ons?</P>
<P>The order, harmony, and regularity, in the revolutions of the heavenly bodies, are &s;uch inconte&s;table proofs of the exi&s;tence of God, that an eminent poet well &s;aid, "An undevout a&s;tronomer is mad." In the time of Cicero, when the knowledge of a&s;tro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">my was very im|perfect, he did not he&s;itate to declare&punc; that in his opin|ion the man who a&s;&s;erted the heavenly bodies were not framed and moved by a divine under&s;tanding, was him|&s;elf
<PB N="201" REF="031827_0199_0FEEC593F78A7D98">
void of all under&s;tanding. Well indeed is it &s;aid, that the heavens declare the glory of God.</P>
<P>This great Being is every where pre&s;ent. He ex|i&s;ts all around us. He is not, as we are apt to imagine, at a great di&s;tance. Wherever we turn, his image meets our view. We &s;ee him in the earth, in the ocean, in the air, in the &s;un, moon, and &s;tars. We feel him in our&s;elves. He is always working round us; he performs the greate&s;t operations, produces the no|ble&s;t effects, di&s;covers him&s;elf in a thou&s;and different ways, and yet the real GOD remains un&s;een. All parts of creation are equally under his in&s;pection. Though he warms the brea&s;t of the highe&s;t angel in heaven, yet he breathes life into the meane&s;t in&s;ect on earth. He lives through all his works, &s;upporting all by the word of his power. He &s;hines in the verdure that clothes the plains, in the lily that delights the vale, and in the fore&s;t that waves on the mountain. He &s;upports the &s;lender reed that trembles in the bre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ze, and the &s;turdy oak that defies the tempe&s;t. His p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;|ence cheers the inanimate creation.</P>
<P>Far in the wilderne&s;s, where human eye never &s;aw, where the &s;avage foot never trod, there he bids the blooming fore&s;t &s;mile, and the blu&s;hing ro&s;e open its leaves to the morning &s;un. There he cau&s;es the feath|ered inhabitants to whi&s;tle their wild notes to the li&s;t|ening trees and echoing mountains. There nature lives in all her wanton wildne&s;s. There the ravi&s;hed eye, hurrying from &s;cene to &s;cene, is lo&s;t in one va&s;t blu&s;h of beauty. From the dark &s;tream that rolls through the fore&s;t, the &s;ilver-&s;caled fi&s;h leap up, and dumbly mean the prai&s;e of God. Though man remain &s;ilent, yet God will have prai&s;e. He regards, ob&s;erves, upholds, connects, and equals all.</P>
<P>The belief of his exi&s;tence is not a point of mere &s;pec|ulation and amu&s;ement. It is of inconceivable import|ance to our pre&s;ent, as well as future felicity. But while we believe there is a God, we &s;hould be extreme|ly careful to a&s;certain, with as much accuracy as po&s;&s;i|ble,
<PB N="202" REF="031827_0200_0FEEC54334E66390">
what is his real nature. The mo&s;t prominent fea|tures of this are exhibited in that incomprehen&s;ible di&s;|play of wi&s;dom, power, and goodne&s;s, made in the works of creation. A virtuous man &s;tands in a rela|tion to God which is peculiarly delightful. The divine perfections are all engaged in his defence. He feels powerful in God's power, wi&s;e in his wi&s;dom, good in his goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>The vicious man, on the contrary, &s;tands in a rela|tion to God, which is of all things the mo&s;t dreadful. He is unwilling to know that God has &s;ufficient wi&s;dom to &s;earch out all his wickedne&s;s, &s;ufficient goodne&s;s to the univer&s;e to determine to puni&s;h that wickedne&s;s, and &s;ufficient power to execute that determination. A firm belief in the exi&s;tence of God will heighten all the enjoyments of life, and, by conforming our hearts to his will, will &s;ecure the approbation of a good con|&s;cience, and in&s;pire us with the hopes of a ble&s;&s;ed im|mortality.</P>
<P>Never be tempted to di&s;believe the exi&s;tence of God, when every thing around you proclaims it in a language too plain not to be under&s;tood. Never ca&s;t your eyes on creation without having your &s;ouls expanded with this &s;entiment, "There is a God." When you &s;ur|vey this globe of earth, with all its appendages; when you behold it inhabited by numberle&s;s ranks of crea|tures, all moving in their proper &s;pheres, all verging to their proper ends, all animated by the &s;ame great &s;ource of life, all &s;upported at the &s;ame great bounte|ous table; when you behold not only the earth, but the ocean and the air, &s;warming with living creatures, all happy in their &s;ituation; when you behold yonder &s;un, darting an effulgent blaze of glory over the heav|ens, garni&s;hing mighty worlds, and waking ten thou|&s;and &s;ongs of prai&s;e; when you behold unnumbered &s;y&s;tems diffu&s;ed through va&s;t immen&s;ity, clothed in &s;plen|dor, and rolling in maje&s;ty; when you behold the&s;e things, your affections will ri&s;e above all the vanities of time; your full &s;ouls will &s;truggle with ec&s;ta&s;y, and

All this for what? for the &s;hort-lived plea&s;ures of a riotous, di&s;&s;olute life. How wretched, when he finds his athei&s;tical confidence to|tally di&s;appointed!

<HEAD>THE DIGNITY OF HUMAN NATURE. EXTRACT OF AN ORATION DELIVERED AT RHODE-ISLAND COLLEGE, 1796.</HEAD>
<P>GUIDED by rea&s;on, man has travelled through the ab&s;tru&s;e regions of the philo&s;ophic world. He has originated rules by which he can direct the &s;hip through the pathle&s;s ocean, and mea&s;ure the comet's flight over the fields of unlimited &s;pace. He has e&s;tab|li&s;hed &s;ociety and government. He can aggregate the profu&s;ions of every climate, and every &s;ea&s;on. He can meliorate the &s;everity, and remedy the imperfections,
<PB N="204" REF="031827_0202_0FEEC598354C97A0">
of nature her&s;elf. All the&s;e things he can perform by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of rea&s;on.</P>
<P>By imagination, man &s;eems to verge towards crea|tive power. Aided by this, he can perform all the wonders of &s;culpture and painting. He can almo&s;t make the marble &s;peak. He can almo&s;t make the brook murmur down the painted land&s;cape. Often, on the pinions of imagination, he &s;oars aloft where the eye has never travelled; where other &s;tars glitter on the mantle of night, and a more effulgent &s;un lights up the blu&s;hes of morning. Flying from world to world, he gazes on all the glories of creation; or, lighting on the di&s;tant margin of the univer&s;e, darts the eye of fancy over the mighty void, where power creative never yet has energized; where exi&s;tence &s;till &s;leeps in the wide aby&s;s of po&s;&s;ibility.</P>
<P>By imagination he can travel back to the &s;ource of time; conver&s;e with the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive generations of men, and kindle into emulation while he &s;urveys the monu|mental trophies of ancient art and glory. He can &s;ail down the &s;tream of time until he lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; &s;ight of &s;tars and &s;un, by wandering into tho&s;e re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ed parts of eter|nity, when the heavens and the earth &s;hall be no more."</P>
<P>To the&s;e unequivocal characteri&s;tics of greatne&s;s in man, let us adduce the te&s;timony of nature her&s;elf. Surrounding creation &s;ub&s;erves the wants and proclaims the dignity of man. For him day and night vi&s;it the world. For him the &s;ea&s;ons walk their &s;plendid round. For him the earth teems with riches, and the heavens &s;mile with beneficence.</P>
<P>All creation is accurately adju&s;ted to his capacity for bli&s;s. He ta&s;tes the dainties of fe&s;tivity, breathes the perfumes of morning, revels on the charms of melody, and regales his eye with all the painted beauties of vi&s;ion. Whatever can plea&s;e, whatever can charm, whatever can expand the &s;oul with ec&s;ta&s;y of bli&s;s, allures and &s;olicits his attention. All things beautiful, all things grand, all things &s;ublime, appear in native love|line&s;s, and proffer man the riche&s;t plea&s;ures of fruition.</P>

<HEAD>EXTRACT FROM MR. PITT'S SPEECH IN THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT,
<DATE>MAY 13, 1777.</DATE></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS is a flying moment; perhaps but &s;ix weeks left to arre&s;t the dangers that &s;urround us. It is difficult for government, after all that has pa&s;&s;ed, to &s;hake hands with defiers of the king, defiers of the par|liament, defiers of the people. I am a defier of nobody; but if an end is not put to this war, there is an end to this kingdom. I do not tru&s;t my judgment in my pre&s;|ent &s;tate of health; this is the judgment of my better days; the re&s;ult of forty years attention to America. They are re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">! but what are they rebels for? Surely not for defending their unque&s;tionable rights! What have the&s;e rebels done heretofore! I remember when they rai&s;ed four regiments on their own bottom, and took Loui&s;burg from the veteran troops of France.</P>
<P>But their exce&s;&s;es have been great! I do not mean their panegyric; but mu&s;t ob&s;erve, in extenuation, the erroneous and infatuated coun&s;els, which have pre|vailed. The door to mercy and ju&s;tice has been &s;hut again&s;t them. But they may &s;till be taken up upon the grounds of their former &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. I &s;tate to you the importance of America; it is a double market; a market of con&s;umption, and a market of &s;upply. This double market for millions with naval &s;tores, you are giving to your hereditary rival.</P>
<P>America has carried you through four wars, and will now carry you to your death, if you do not take things in time. In the &s;port&s;man's phra&s;e, when you have
<PB N="215" REF="031827_0213_0FEEC55AD6BF7898">
found your&s;elves at fault, you mu&s;t try back. You have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n&s;acked every corner of lower Saxony; but forty thou&s;and German boors never can conquer ten times the number of Briti&s;h freemen. They may ravage; they cannot conquer. But you would conquer, you &s;ay! Why, what would you conquer? the map of America? I am ready to meet any general officer on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>What will you do out of the protection of your feet? In the winter, if together, they are &s;tarved; and if di&s;per&s;ed, they are taken off in detail. I am ex|perienced in <HI>&s;pring</HI> hopes and <HI>vernal</HI> promi&s;es. I know what mini&s;ters throw out; but at la&s;t will come your <HI>equinoctial</HI> di&s;appointment. They tell you&mdash; what? That your army will be as &s;trong as it was la&s;t year, when it was not &s;trong enough. You have gained nothing in America but &s;tations. You have been three years teaching them the art of war. They are apt &s;cholars; and I will venture to tell your lord&s;hips, that the American gentry will make officers enough, fit to command the troops of all the European powers. What you have &s;ent there are too many to make peace, too few to make war.</P>
<P>If you conquer them, what then? You cannot make them re&s;pect you: you cannot make them wear your doth. You will plant an invincible hatred in their brea&s;ts again&s;t you. Coming from the &s;tock they do, they can never re&s;pect you. If mini&s;ters are founded in &s;aying there is no &s;ort of treaty with France, there is &s;till a moment left; the point of honor is &s;till &s;afe. France mu&s;t be as &s;elf-de&s;troying as England, to make a treaty while you are giving her America, at the ex|pen&s;e of twelve millions a year. The intercour&s;e has produced every thing to France; and England, poor old England mu&s;t pay for all.</P>
<P>I have at different times made different propo&s;itions, adapted to the c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rcum&s;tances in whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h they were offer|ed. The plan contained in the former bill is now im|practicable; the pre&s;ent motion will tell you where
<PB N="216" REF="031827_0214_0FEEC5AE84A671E8">
you are, and what you have now to depend upon. It may produce a re&s;pectable divi&s;ion in America, and una|nimity at home. It will give America an option: &s;he has yet made no option. You have &s;aid, Lay down your arms, and &s;he has given you the Spartan an&s;wer, "Come and take them."</P>
<P>I will get out of my bed, on Monday, to move for an immediate redre&s;s of all their grievances, and for continuing to them the right of di&s;po&s;ing of their own property. This will be the herald of peace; this will open the way for treaty; this will &s;how that parliament is &s;incerely di&s;po&s;ed. Yet &s;till much mu&s;t be left to treaty. Should you conquer this people, you conquer under the cannon of France; under a ma&s;ked battery then ready to open. The moment a treaty with France appears, you mu&s;t declare war, though you had only five &s;hips of the line in England: but France will defer a treaty as long as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>You are now at the mercy of every little German chancery; and the preten&s;ions of France will increa&s;e daily, &s;o as to become an avowed party in either peace or war. We have tried for unconditional &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; let us try what can be gained by unconditional re|dre&s;s. Le&s;s dignity will be lo&s;t in the repeal, than in &s;ubmitting to the demands of German chanceries. We are the aggre&s;&s;ors. We have invaded them. We have invaded them as much as the Spani&s;h armada in|vaded England. Mercy cannot do harm; it will &s;eat the king where he ought to be, throned on the hearts of his people; and millions at home and abroad, now employed in obloquy or revolt, would then pray for him.</P>

<P>Why, my dear, it was only taking a little of my own fortune beforehand, for I am his heir; &s;o we all agreed it was merely robbing my&s;elf&punc; for we had &s;everal con&s;ultations about it; and one of us is to be a lawyer.</P>

<P>Neither had I, my deary; but I take it for granted. Be&s;ides, our little lawyer put it into my head. Well, we wrote again, and told the poor old &s;oul, for which I a&s;&s;ure you I am heartily penitent, that, if he did not &s;end me double the &s;um, in the &s;ame manner, without delay, his hou&s;e was to be &s;et on fire, while he and all

Now don't make faces nor &s;hruggings; for I promi&s;e you, I think al|ready I de&s;erve to be hung for giving him the fright; though I would not really have hurt the hair of his head for half his fortune. But who could have gue&s;&s;|ed that the old codger would have <HI>bitten</HI> &s;o readily?

<P>Yes, my darling. You have no conception how convenient it would have been for our extra ex|pen&s;es. But, unluckily, uncle grew wor&s;e, and went abroad; and then con&s;ulted with &s;ome crab of a friend, and that friend, with &s;ome demagogue of a magi&s;trate, and &s;o all is now blown.

<P>O yes, yes; an odd thing of that &s;ort happens now and then.

<P>But Edgar has had an extraordinary educa|tion, as well as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing extraordinary talents and goodne&s;s; you too, my dear Lionel, to fulfil what may be expected from you, &s;hould look back to your father, who was brought up at the &s;ame univer&s;ity, and is now con&s;idered as one of the fir&s;t men it has produced. While he was re&s;pected by the learned for his application, he was loved even by the indolent for his candor and kindne&s;s of heart. And though his in|come, as you know, was very &s;mall, he never ran in debt; and by an exact but open economy, e&s;caped all imputation of meanne&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lion.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; but all this is nothing to the purpo&s;e. My father is no more like other men than if he had been born in another planet; and my attempting to re&s;emble him would be as great a joke, as if you were to dre&s;s up in Indiana's flowers and feathers, and ex|pect people to call you a beauty. I was born a bit of a buck; and have no manner of natural ta&s;te for &s;tudy, and poring, and expounding, and black-letter work. I am a light, airy &s;park, at your &s;ervice, ladies; not quite &s;o wi&s;e as I am merry. I am one of your ec|centric geniu&s;es; but let that pa&s;s. My father, you know, is firm as a rock. He minds neither wind nor weather, nor fleerer nor &s;neerer, nor joker nor jeerer; but his firmne&s;s he has kept all to him&s;elf; not a whit

of it do I inherit. Every wind that blows veers me about, and gives me a new direction. But with all my father's firmne&s;s and knowledge, I very much doubt whether he knows any thing of real life. That is the main thing, my dear hearts. But, come, Lavinia, fin|i&s;h your me&s;&s;age.</P>

I meant nothing at fir&s;t but a &s;illy joke, and all this mi&s;chief has followed unaccountably.

If I could find words for them, if my powers bore any pro|portion to my zeal, I would &s;well my voice to &s;uch a note of remon&s;trance, it &s;hould reach every log-hou&s;e beyond the mountains. I would &s;ay to the inhabitants, Wake from your fal&s;e &s;ecurity. Your cruel dangers, your more cruel apprehen&s;ions are &s;oon to be renewed. The wounds, yet unhealed, are to be torn open again. In the day time, your path through the woods will be ambu&s;hed. The darkne&s;s of midnight will glitter with the blaze of your dwellings. You are a father; the blood of your &s;ons &s;hall fatten your cornfield. You are a mother; the war hoop &s;hall wake the &s;leep of the cradle.</P>
<P>On this &s;ubject you need not &s;u&s;pect any deception on your feelings. It is a &s;pectacle of horror which cannot be overdrawn. If you have nature in your hearts, they will &s;peak a language, compared with which, all I have &s;aid or can &s;ay, will be poor and frigid. Will it be whi&s;pered that the treaty has made me a new champion for the protection of the frontiers? It is known that my voice as well as vote have been uni|formly given in conformity with the ideas I have ex|pre&s;&s;ed. Protection is the right of the frontiers; it is our duty to give it.</P>
<P>Who will accu&s;e me of wandering out of the &s;ubject? Who will &s;ay that I exaggerate the tendencies of our mea&s;ures? Will any one an&s;wer by a &s;neer, that all this is idle preaching? Will any one deny that we are bound, and I would hope to good purpo&s;e, by the mo&s;t &s;olemn &s;anctions of duty for the vote we give? Are de&s;pots alone to be reproached for unfeeling indifference to the tears and blood of their &s;ubjects? Are republi|cans unre&s;pon&s;ible? Have the principles on which you ground the reproach upon cabinets and kings no prac|tical influence, no binding force? Are they merely themes of idle declamation, introduced to decorate the morality of a new&s;paper e&s;&s;ay, or to furni&s;h pretty top|ics of harangue from the windows of that State hou&s;e?
<PB N="232" REF="031827_0230_0FEEC5C1A68ACE58">
I tru&s;t it is neither too pre&s;umptuous nor too late to a&s;k, Can you put the deare&s;t intere&s;t of &s;ociety at ri&s;k, without guilt, and without remor&s;e?</P>
<P>By rejecting the po&s;ts, we light the &s;avage fires; we bind the victims. This day we undertake to ren|der account to the widows and orphans whom our de|ci&s;ion will make, to the wretches that will be roa&s;ted at the &s;take, to our country, and I do not deem it too &s;erious to &s;ay, to con&s;cience, and to God. We are an|&s;werable; and if duty be any thing more than a word of impo&s;ture; if con&s;cience be not a bugbear, we are preparing to make our&s;elves as wretched as our country.</P>
<P>There is no mi&s;take in this ca&s;e; there can be none. Experience has already been the prophet of events, and the cries of our future victims have already reached us. The we&s;tern inhabitants are not a &s;ilent and un|complaining &s;acrifice. The voice of humanity i&s;&s;ues from the &s;hade of the wilderne&s;s.

<HEAD>EXTRACT FROM AN ORATION, PRONOUNCED AT WORCESTER, (MASS.)
<DATE>JULY 4, 1796;</DATE>
BY FRANCIS BLAKE, ESQ.</HEAD>
<P>IN viewing the cau&s;es which led to the event of this joyous anniver&s;ary; in tracing the effects which have re&s;ulted to America; in &s;earching for the princi|ples which impelled to the conte&s;t; in recalling the feelings which &s;upported us in the &s;truggle, it cannot fail to occur to us that the cau&s;es have not been con|fined to the limits of our continent; that the effects have extended far beyond the boundaries of our nation; that the glorious example, with electrical rapidity, has fla&s;hed acro&s;s the atlantic; that, guided by the &s;ame principles, conducted by the &s;ame feelings, the people, who &s;o gallantly fought and bled for the &s;ecurity of our lives and our liberties, are now fighting and bleed|ing in defence of their own.</P>
<P>On this day, therefore, religiou&s;ly devoted to the con&s;ecration of our independence, it becomes us, as the votaries of freedom, as friends to the rights of man, and bound to &s;upport them whenever invaded, to turn our attention, with a grateful enthu&s;ia&s;m, to the &s;cenes of their &s;ufferings, their revolt, and their victories. While exulting in the full enjoyment of peace and tran|quillity, &s;hall not a tear for the unexampled di&s;tre&s;&s;es of this magnanimous nation, check, for a moment, the emotions of our joy?</P>
<P>They have &s;worn that they will live FREE or DIE! They have &s;olemnly &s;worn, that the &s;word, which has been drawn in defence of their country, &s;hall never be returned to its &s;cabbard, till it has &s;ecured to them vic|tory and freedom. Let us then breathe forth a fervent ejaculation to Heaven, that their vows may be remem|bered; that the cau&s;e of our former allies may not be
<PB N="235" REF="031827_0233_0FEEC5726DC076A0">
de&s;erted, till they have &s;courged their invaders; till they have driven them back in confu&s;ion to the regions of terror, from whence they emerged.</P>
<P>While we remember with horror the continued effu|&s;ion of blood, which darkened the morning of their revolution, let us not forget that their vengeance was rou&s;ed by the champions of de&s;poti&s;m, who&s;e lives have &s;ince ju&s;tly atoned for the crimes they committed. While we lament the &s;anguinary &s;cenes, which cloud|ed its progre&s;s, let it not be forgotten that they aro&s;e from the bloody manife&s;to of a band of tyrants, com|bined for the helli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h purpo&s;e of again rivetting the chains they had broken.</P>
<P>The league of Pilnitz, like the league of Satan and his angels, revolting again&s;t the Maje&s;ty of heaven, was profe&s;&s;edly fabricated, to arre&s;t forever the pro|gre&s;s of freedom; to u&s;urp the dominion of France, and divide the &s;poil among this band of royal plunder|ers. Have we not heard, that the noble, the generous, the grateful monarch of the fore&s;t, that fawned at the feet of Androcles, when remembering his former friend|&s;hip, will ever turn with fury on his pur&s;uers; and when robbed of his whelps, re&s;ts not till his fangs are crim&s;oned in the blood of the aggre&s;&s;or?</P>
<P>Shall then the fervor of our friend&s;hip be abated, by remembering the tran&s;itory frenzy of a people di&s;tract|ed with the enthu&s;ia&s;m of freedom, and irritated to madne&s;s by the dreadful pro&s;pect of lo&s;ing what they had enjoyed but for a moment? Let it never be &s;aid of us, as of Rome and of Athens, that ingratitude is the common vice of republics. Was it to the crowned monarch, named Louis the Sixteenth, or to the people of France, that we were indebted, for the blood and trea&s;ure that were &s;o profu&s;ely lavi&s;hed in our cau&s;e? Shall then their &s;ervices be forgotten, in the remem|brance of their momentary exce&s;&s;es? Or &s;hall we re|fu&s;e our mo&s;t cordial concurrence in the feelings which impel them to the pre&s;ent conte&s;t with the ruffian po|tentates of Europe?</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="031827_0234_0FEEC5CB453CBE78">Can we doubt, for a moment, which is the cau&s;e we are bound to &s;upport with our &s;anction, when we behold the winds and the &s;eas, tho&s;e dreadful mini&s;ters of Heav|en's vengeance, commi&s;&s;ioned to advance their progre&s;s, and deluge their enemies? When we behold Ariel, with his attendant &s;pirits, gently hovering over their navies, and wafting then to victory on the bo&s;om of the ocean; while Neptune and Boreas have combined again&s;t the league of their oppre&s;&s;ors, to overwhelm in the deep the&s;e deluded followers of Pharaoh! Have we not &s;een them fed, as with manna from heaven; the waters divided, and the walls of Jericho falling before them, while the fair pro&s;pect of liberty has led them in triumph through the wilderne&s;s, as a cloud by day, and a pillar of fire by night!</P>
<P>AMERICANS! Let us join in a fervent &s;upplica|tion, that the &s;acred charters of humanity, which we have once &s;ealed with our blood, may be forever pre|&s;erved from the deadly gra&s;p of tyrants.</P>
<P>FRENCHMEN! Be firm, be undaunted in the &s;truggle you have thus miraculou&s;ly &s;upported. Evince to the world, now gazing with admiration at your ex|ploits in the field of battle, that you have virtue equal to your courage; that you are friends to the friends of humanity; that your arms are nerved only again&s;t the enemies of man. Let not the &s;acred name of LIBER|TY be polluted by the frenzy of licentious pa&s;&s;ions; but may your pre&s;ent glorious con&s;titution, while it protects your freedom from the unhallowed ravages of tyranny, remain an un&s;haken bulwark again&s;t the de|&s;tructive fury of faction.</P>
<P>TYRANTS! Turn from the impious work of blood in which your hands are imbrued, and tremble at the de&s;peration of your revolting &s;ubjects! Repent in &s;ack|cloth and a&s;hes. For behold, ye, who have been ex|alted up to heaven, &s;hall, ere long, be ca&s;t down to hell! The final period of your crimes is rapidly approaching. The grand POLITICAL MILLENNIUM is at hand;
<PB N="237" REF="031827_0235_0FEEC579CD06CEF0">
when tyranny &s;hall be buried in ruins; when all na|tions &s;hall be united in ONE MIGHTY REPUBLIC! When the four angels, that &s;tand on the four corners of the globe, &s;hall, with one accord, lift up their voices to heaven; proclaiming PEACE ON EARTH, AND GOOD WILL TO ALL MEN.</P>

<HEAD>PART OF MR. O'CONNOR'S SPEECH IN THE IRISH HOUSE OF COMMONS, IN FAVOR OF THE BILL FOR E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ANCIPATING THE ROMAN CATH|OLICS, 1795.</HEAD>
<P>IF I were to judge from the dead &s;ilence with which my &s;peech has been received, I &s;hould &s;u&s;pect that what I have &s;aid was not very palatable to &s;ome men in this Hou&s;e. But I have not ri&s;ked connexions, en|deared to me by every tie of blood and friend&s;hip, to &s;upport one &s;et of men in preference to another. I have hazarded too much, to allow the breath of calum|ny to taint the objects I have had in view, from the part I have taken. Immutable principles, on which the happine&s;s and liberty of my countrymen depend, con|vey to my mind the only &s;ub&s;tantial boon for which great &s;acrifices &s;hould be made.</P>
<P>And I here avow my&s;elf the zealous and earne&s;t advocate for the mo&s;t unqualified emancipation of my catholic countrymen; in the hope and conviction, that the monopoly of the rights and liberties of my country, which has hitherto effectually with&s;tood the efforts of a part of the people, mu&s;t yield to the unanimous will, to the decided intere&s;t, and to the general effort of a whole united people. It is from this conviction, and it is for that tran&s;cendently important object, that, while the noble Lord and the Right Honorable Secre|tary, are offering to ri&s;k their lives and fortunes in &s;up|port of a &s;y&s;tem that militates again&s;t the liberty of my countrymen, I will ri&s;k every thing dear to me on earth.</P>
<P>It is for this great object I have, I fear, more than ri&s;ked connexions dearer to me than life it&s;elf. But he mu&s;t be a &s;piritle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> man, and this a &s;piritle&s;s nation, not to re&s;ent the ba&s;ene&s;s of a Briti&s;h Mini&s;ter, who has rai&s;ed our hopes in order to &s;educe a rival to &s;hare with him the di&s;grace of this accur&s;ed political cru&s;ade, and bla&s;t them afterwards, that he may degrade a competit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r

to the &s;tation of a dependant. And, that he may de|&s;troy friend&s;hip which his nature never knew, he has &s;ported with the feelings of a whole nation. Rai&s;ing the cup with one hand to the parched lip of expectancy, he has da&s;hed it to the earth with the other, in all the wantonne&s;s of in&s;ult, and with all the aggravation of contempt.</P>
<P>Does he imagine, that the people of this country, after he has tantalized them with the cheering hope of pre&s;ent alleviation, and of future pro&s;perity, will tamely bear to be forced to a re-endurance of their former &s;ufferings, and to a re-appointment of their former &s;poilers? Does he, from confidence of long &s;ucce&s;s in debauching the human mind, exact from you, calling your&s;elves the repre&s;entatives of the people of Ireland, to reject a bill, which has received the unanimous con|&s;ent of your con&s;tituents? or does he mean to puzzle the ver&s;atile di&s;po&s;ition of this Hou&s;e, on which he has made &s;o many &s;ucce&s;sful experiments already, by di&s;|tracting you between obedience to his imperious man|dates, and obedience to the will of the people you &s;hould repre&s;ent?</P>
<P>Or does he flatter him&s;elf, that he &s;hall now &s;ucceed, becau&s;e he has &s;ucceeded in betraying his own country, into exchanging that peace, by which &s;he might have retrieved her &s;hattered finances, for a war, in which he has &s;quandered twenty times a greater trea&s;ure, in the cour&s;e of two years, than with all his famed economy, he had been able to &s;ave, in the cour&s;e of ten? for a war in which the prime youth of the world have been offered up, victims to his ambition and his &s;chemes, as boundle&s;s and pre&s;umptuous, as ill-concerted and ill-combined; for a war in which the plains of every nation in Europe have been crim&s;oned with oceans of blood; for a war in which his country has reaped nothing but di&s;grace, and which mu&s;t ultimately prove her ruin?</P>
<P>Does he flatter him&s;elf, that he &s;hall be enabled, Satan like, to end his political career by involving the whole empire in a civil war, from which nothing can

accrue, but a doleful and barren conque&s;t to the victor? I tru&s;t the people of England are too wi&s;e and too ju&s;t to attempt to force mea&s;ures upon us which they would them&s;elves reject with di&s;dain. I tru&s;t they have not them&s;elves &s;o &s;oon forgotten the le&s;&s;on they &s;o recently learned from America, which &s;hould &s;erve as a la&s;ting example to nations, again&s;t employing force to &s;ubdue the &s;pirit of a people, determined to be free!</P>
<P>But if they &s;hould be &s;o weak, or &s;o wicked, as to &s;uffer them&s;elves to be &s;educed by a man, to who&s;e &s;oul, duplicity and fine&s;&s;e are as congenial, as ingenuou&s;|ne&s;s and fair dealing is a &s;tranger, to become the in&s;tru|ments of &s;upporting a few odious public characters in power and rapacity, again&s;t the intere&s;t and again&s;t the &s;en&s;e of a whole people; if we are to be dragooned into mea&s;ures again&s;t our will, by a nation that would lo&s;e her la&s;t life, and expend her la&s;t guinea, in re&s;ent|ing a &s;imilar in&s;ult, if offered to her&s;elf, I tru&s;t &s;he will find in the people of this country a &s;pirit in no wi&s;e in|ferior to her own.</P>
<P>You are at this moment at the mo&s;t awful period of your lives. The Mini&s;ter of England has committed you with your country; and on this night your adop|tion or rejection of this bill, mu&s;t determine, in the eyes of the Iri&s;h nation, which you repre&s;ent, the Min|i&s;ter of England, or the people of Ireland! And, al|though you are convinced, you do not repre&s;ent the people of Ireland; although you are convinced, every man of you, that you are &s;elf-created, it does not alter the nature of the conte&s;t; it is &s;till a conte&s;t between the Mini&s;ter of England and the people of Ireland; and the weakne&s;s of your title &s;hould only make you the more circum&s;pect in the exerci&s;e of your power.</P>
<P>Fortunately, the views of the Briti&s;h Mini&s;ter have been detected; fortunately the people of this country &s;ee him in his true colors. Like the de&s;perate game&s;ter, who has lo&s;t his all, in the wilde&s;t &s;chemes of aggran|dizement, he looks round for &s;ome dupe to &s;upply him, with the further means of future projects; and in the
<PB N="246" REF="031827_0244_0FEEC5E5147A14A8">
crafty &s;ubtlene&s;s of his &s;oul, he fondly imagines, he has found that ea&s;y dupe in the credulity of the Iri&s;h nation. After he has exhau&s;ted his own country in a cru&s;ade again&s;t that phantom, political opinion, he flatters him|&s;elf he &s;hall be enabled to re&s;u&s;citate her at the ex|pen&s;e of yours.</P>
<P>As you value the peace and happine&s;s of your coun|try; as you value the rights and liberties of the &s;oil that has given you birth; and if you are not lo&s;t to every &s;en&s;e of feeling for your own con&s;equence and importance as men, I call on you this night to make your &s;tand. I call on you to rally round the independ|ence of your country, who&s;e exi&s;tence has been &s;o artfully a&s;&s;ailed. Believe me, the Briti&s;h Mini&s;ter will leave you in the lurch, when he &s;ees that the people of this nation are too much in earne&s;t to be tricked out of their rights, or the independence of their country.</P>
<P>What a di&s;play of legi&s;lation have we had on this night? Artificers who neither know the foundation on which they work, the in&s;truments they ought to u&s;e, nor the materials required! Is it on the narrow ba&s;is of monopoly and exclu&s;ion you would erect a temple to the growing liberty of your country? If you will legi&s;late; know, that on the broad ba&s;is of immutable ju&s;tice only, you can rai&s;e a la&s;ting, beauteous temple to the liberty of your i&s;land; who&s;e ample ba&s;e &s;hall lodge, and who&s;e roof &s;hall &s;helter her united family from the rankling inclemency of rejection and exclu&s;ion. Know, that rea&s;on is that &s;ilken thread by which the lawgiver leads his people; and above all, know, that in the knowledge of the temper of the public mind, con&s;i&s;ts the &s;kill and the wi&s;dom of the legi&s;lator.</P>
<P>Do not imagine that the minds of your countrymen have been &s;tationary, while that of all Europe has been rapidly progre&s;&s;ive; for you mu&s;t be blind not to per|ceive, that the whole European mind has undergone a revolution, neither confined to this nor to that country; but as general as the great cau&s;es which have given it birth, and &s;till continue to feed its growth. In vain do
<PB N="247" REF="031827_0245_0FEEC63233639420">
the&s;e men, who &s;ub&s;i&s;t but on the abu&s;es of the govern|ment under which they live, flatter them&s;elves, that what we have &s;een the&s;e la&s;t &s;ix years is but the fever of the moment, which will pa&s;s away as &s;oon as the pa|tient has been let blood enough.</P>
<P>As well may they attempt to alter the cour&s;e of na|ture, without altering her laws. If they would effect a counter revolution in the European mind, they mu&s;t de&s;troy commerce and its effects; they mu&s;t aboli&s;h ev|ery trace of the mariner's compa&s;s; they mu&s;t con&s;ign every book to the flames; they mu&s;t obliterate every ve&s;tige of the invention of the pre&s;s; they mu&s;t de&s;troy the conduit of intelligence, by de&s;troying the in&s;titu|tion of the po&s;t office. Then, and not till then, they and their abu&s;es may live on, in all the &s;ecurity which ignorance, &s;uper&s;tition, and want of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oncert in the people can be&s;tow.</P>
<P>But while I would overwhelm with de&s;pair tho&s;e men who have been nur&s;ed in the lap of venality and pro&s;titution; who have been educated in contempt and ridicule of a love for their country; and who have grown grey in &s;coffing at every thing like public &s;pirit, let me congratulate every true friend to mankind, that that commerce, which has begotten &s;o much independ|ence, will continue to beget more; and let me congratu|late every friend to the human &s;pecies, that the pre&s;s, which has &s;ent &s;uch a ma&s;s of information into the world, will continue, with accelerated rapidity, to pour forth its trea&s;ures &s;o beneficial to mankind.</P>
<P>It is to the&s;e great cau&s;es we are indebted, that the combination of prie&s;ts and de&s;pots, which &s;o long ty|rannized over the civil and political liberty of Europe, has been di&s;&s;olved. It is to the&s;e great cau&s;es we are indebted, that no prie&s;t, be his religion what it may, dares preach the doctrine which inculcates the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;acrificing every right and every ble&s;&s;ing this world can afford, as the only mean of obtaining eternal hap|pine&s;s in the life to come.</P>

<HEAD>COLONEL BARRE'S SPEECH IN THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT, 1765, ON THE STAMP-ACT BILL.</HEAD>
<P>ON the fir&s;t reading of the bill, Mr. Town&s;end &s;poke in its favor; and concluded with the fol|lowing words: "And will the&s;e Americans, children planted by our care; nouri&s;hed up by our indulgence, until they are grown to a degree of &s;trength and opu|lence; and protected by our arms; will they grudge to contribute their mite, to relieve us from the heavy weight of that burden which we lie under?"</P>
<P>On this Colonel Barre ro&s;e, and an&s;wered Mr. Town|&s;end in the following ma&s;terly manner.</P>
<P>"They planted by YOUR care!" No; your op|pre&s;&s;ions planted them in America. They fled from your tyranny, to a then uncultivated and unho&s;pitable country, where they expo&s;ed them&s;elves to almo&s;t all the hard&s;hips to which human nature is liable; and among others, to the cruelties of a &s;avage foe, the mo&s;t &s;ubtle, and I will take upon me to &s;ay, the mo&s;t for|midable of any people upon the face of the earth; and yet, actuated by principles of true Engli&s;h liberty, they met all hard&s;hips with plea&s;ure, compared with tho&s;e they &s;uffered in their own country, from the hands of tho&s;e who &s;hould have been their friends.</P>
<P>"They nouri&s;hed up by YOUR indulgence!" They grew by your neglect of them. As &s;oon as you began to care about them, that care was exerci&s;ed in &s;ending
<PB N="253" REF="031827_0251_0FEEC63B20BDF928">
per&s;ons to rule them, in one department and another, who were, perhaps, the deputies of deputies to &s;ome members of this Hou&s;e, &s;ent to &s;py out their liberties, to mi&s;repre&s;ent their actions, and to prey upon them; men, who&s;e behaviour, on many occa&s;ions, has cau&s;ed the blood of tho&s;e &s;ons of liberty to recoil within them; men promoted to the highe&s;t &s;eats of ju&s;tice; &s;ome, who, to my knowledge, were glad, by going to a for|eign country, to e&s;cape being brought to the bar of a court of ju&s;tice in their own.</P>
<P>"They protected by YOUR arms!" They have nobly taken up arms in your defence; have exerted a valor, amid&s;t their con&s;tant and laborious indu&s;try, for the defence of a country, who&s;e frontier was drenched in blood, while its interior parts yielded all its little &s;avings to your emoluments.</P>
<P>And, believe me; remember I this day told you &s;o, that the &s;ame &s;pirit of freedom, which actuated that people at fir&s;t, will accompany them &s;till. But pru|dence forbids me to explain my&s;elf further. Heaven knows, I do not at this time &s;peak from motives of party heat; what I deliver are the genuine &s;entiments of my heart.</P>
<P>However &s;uperior to me in general knowledge and experience the re&s;pectable body of this Hou&s;e may be, yet I claim to know more of America than mo&s;t of you, having &s;een and been conver&s;ant in that country. The people, I believe, are as truly loyal as any &s;ubjects the king has; but a people jealous of their liberties, and who will vindicate them, if ever they &s;hould be violated. But the &s;ubject is too delicate, I will &s;ay no more.</P>

<SPEAKER>Stephen.</SPEAKER>
<P>LADIES and gentlemen, you have prob|ably heard of Foote, the comedian: if not, it is out of my power to tell you any thing about him, except this; he had but one leg, and his name was Samuel. Or, to &s;peak more poetically, one leg he had, and Samuel was his name. This Foote wrote a farce, called the Alderman; in which he attempted to ridicule a well-fed magi&s;trate of the city of London. This la&s;t, hearing of the intended affront, called upon the player, and threatened him &s;everely for his pre|&s;umption. Sir, &s;ays Foote, it is my bu&s;ine&s;s to take off people. You &s;hall &s;ee how well I can take my&s;elf off. So out of the room he went, as though to prepare. The Alderman &s;at waiting, and waiting, and waiting, and&mdash;I have forgotten the re&s;t of the &s;tory; but it ended very comically. So I mu&s;t reque&s;t of you, to mu&s;ter up your wit, and each one end the &s;tory to his own liking. You are all wondering what this &s;tory leads to. Why, I'll tell you; Foote's farce was called the Alderman, ours is called the Medley; his was written according to rule, ours is compo&s;ed at loo&s;e ends. Yet loo&s;e as it is, you will find it made up, like
<PB N="258" REF="031827_0256_0FEEC5EFCD9B90F8">
all other pieces, of nouns, pronouns, verbs, participles, adverbs, conjunctions, articles, adjectives, prepo&s;itions, and interjections. Now, words are very harmle&s;s things; though I confe&s;s that much depends upon the manner of putting them together. The only thing to be &s;ettled is, that, if you &s;hould di&s;like the arrange|ment, you will plea&s;e to alter it, till it &s;uits you.</P>

<SPEAKER>Tru.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, don't you know, that your unruly tongue will be the ruin of you? Did you ever &s;ee a man who was foaming and frothing at the mouth as you are, that ever &s;aid any thing to the purpo&s;e? You ought always to think before you &s;peak, and to con&s;ider well to whom you &s;peak, and the place and time of &s;peaking.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Steph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray who taught you all this worldly wi&s;dom?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tru.</SPEAKER>
<P>My own experience, Sir; which is &s;aid to be the be&s;t &s;chool-ma&s;ter in the world, and ought to teach it to every man of common &s;en&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Steph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, do not imagine that you po&s;&s;e&s;s any great &s;ecret. "Keep your tongue between your teeth" is an old proverb, ru&s;ted and cru&s;ted over, till nobody can tell what it was fir&s;t made of. Prudence, indeed, teaches the &s;ame. So prudence may teach a merchant to keep his ve&s;&s;els in port for fear of a &s;torm at &s;ea. But "nothing venture, nothing have" is my proverb. Now, &s;uppo&s;e all the world &s;hould adopt this prudence, what a multitude of mutes we &s;hould have! There would be an end of news, law-&s;uits, politics, and &s;oci|ety. I tell you, Sir, that bu&s;y tongues are like main &s;prings; they &s;et every thing in motion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tru.</SPEAKER>
<P>But where's a man's dignity, all this time, while his tongue is running at random, without a &s;ingle thought to guide it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Steph.</SPEAKER>
<P>His dignity! that indeed! Out upon parole, where it ought to be. A man's dignity! as though we came into the world to &s;upport dignity, and by an
<PB N="259" REF="031827_0257_0FEEC64AC11242F0">
affected di&s;tance, to make our friends feel their inferi|ority. I con&s;ider men like coins, which becau&s;e &s;tamped with men's heads, pa&s;s for more than they are worth. And when the world is willing to treat a man better than he de&s;erves, there is a meanne&s;s in endeavoring to extort more from them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tru.</SPEAKER>
<P>But &s;hall a man &s;peak without thinking? Did you ever read the old proverb, "Think twice, before you &s;peak once?"</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Steph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and a vile one it is. If a man &s;peak from the impul&s;e of the moment, he'll &s;peak the mean|ing of his heart; and will probably &s;peak the truth. But if he mind your mu&s;ty proverb, there will be more pros and cons in his head, more hams and haws in his delivery, than there are letters in his &s;entences. To your &s;ly, &s;ubtle, thinking fellows, we owe all the lies, cheating, hypocri&s;y, and double-dealing there is in the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Steph.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you know that every &s;ubject has its &s;ides; and we ought to examine, reflect, analyze, &s;ift, con&s;ider, and determine, before we have a right to &s;peak; for the world are entitled to the be&s;t of our thoughts. What would you think of a trade&s;man, who &s;hould &s;end home your coat, boots, or hat, half fini&s;hed? You might think him a very hone&s;t hearted fellow; but you'd never employ him again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tru.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, was there any need of bringing in tail|ors, coblers, and hatters, to help you out? They have nothing to do with this &s;ubject. But you don't under|&s;tand me. I &s;ay, if you would never employ &s;uch work|men a &s;econd time, why &s;hould you ju&s;tify a man for turning out his thoughts half fini&s;hed? The mind la|bors as actually in thinking upon, and maturing a &s;ub|ject, as the body does in the field, or on the &s;hop-board. And, if the farmer knows when his grain is ready for the &s;ickle, and the mechanic, when his work is ready for his cu&s;tomer, the man, who is u&s;ed to thinking, knows when he is ma&s;ter of his &s;ubject, and the proper
<PB N="260" REF="031827_0258_0FEEC5F2A9424D38">
time to communicate his thoughts with ea&s;e to him&s;elf and advantage to others.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Steph.</SPEAKER>
<P>All that is e&s;caping the &s;ubject. None of your figures, when the very original is before you. You talk about a man's mind, ju&s;t as if it were a piece of ground, capable of bearing flax and hemp. You have fairly brought forward a &s;hop-board, and mounted your tailor upon it! Now I have no notion of any cro&s;s-legged work in my inner man. In fact, I don't under&s;tand all this proce&s;s of thinking. My knowledge upon all &s;ubjects is very near the root of my tongue, and I feel great relief, when it gets near the tip.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tru.</SPEAKER>
<P>Depend on it, that thou&s;ands have lo&s;t fame and even life by too great freedom of &s;peech. Trea&s;ons, murders, and robberies, have been generally di&s;covered by the imprudent boa&s;ting of the perpetrators.</P>

<P>Depend on it, that our world has &s;uffered far more by &s;ilent, than by prattling knaves.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tru.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have let off from the tip of your tongue a picked company of dignified &s;ub&s;tantives; but take notice that my doctrine does not extend to the midnight &s;ilence of robbers; but to a due caution and re&s;erve in conveying our thoughts to the world. And this I hope ever to ob&s;erve. And if you determine on a different cour&s;e, re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that the con&s;equences will not be very plea&s;ant.

<HEAD>EXTRACT FROM MR. PITT'S SPEECH,
<DATE>NOV. 18, 1777,</DATE>
ON AMERICAN AFFAIRS.</HEAD>
<P>I RISE, my lords, to declare my &s;entiments on this mo&s;t &s;olemn and &s;erious &s;ubject. It has impo&s;ed a load upon my mind, which, I fear, nothing can re|move; but which impels me to endeavor its alleviation, by a free and unre&s;erved communication of my &s;enti|ments. In the fir&s;t part of the addre&s;s&punc; I have the honor of heartily concurring with the noble Earl who moved it. No man feels &s;incerer joy than I do; none can offer more genuine congratulation on every acce&s;|&s;ion of &s;trength to the Prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion: I there|fore join in every congratulation on the birth of another prince&s;s, and the happy recovery of her Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t &s;top here; my courtly complai&s;ance will carry me no farther. I will not join in congratulation on misfortune and di&s;grace. I cannot concur in a blind and &s;ervile addre&s;s, which approves, and endeav|ors to &s;anctify, the mon&s;trous mea&s;ures that have heap|ed di&s;grace and misfortune upon us; that have broug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> ruin to our doors. This, my lords, is a perilous and tremendous moment! It is not a time for adulation&punc; The &s;moothne&s;s of flattery cannot now avail; cannot &s;ave us in this rugged and awful cri&s;is. It is now ne|ce&s;&s;ary to in&s;truct the throne in the language of truth. We mu&s;t di&s;pel the delu&s;ion and the darkne&s;s which envelop it; and d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;play, in its full danger and true colors, the ruin that is brought to our doors.</P>
<P>And <HI>who</HI> is the mini&s;ter; <HI>where</HI> is the mini&s;ter, who has dared to &s;ugge&s;t to the throne the contrary, un|con&s;titutional language, this day delivered from it? The accu&s;tomed language from the throne has been application to Parliament for advice, and a reliance on its con&s;titutional advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance. As it is the right of Parliament to give, &s;o it is the duty of the crown to a&s;k it. But on this day, and in this extreme
<PB N="263" REF="031827_0261_0FEEC65707813808">
momentous exigency, no reliance is repo&s;ed on our con&s;titutional coun&s;els! no advice is a&s;ked from the &s;ober and enlightened care of Parliament! But the crown, from it&s;elf, and by it&s;elf, declares an unaltera|ble determination to pur&s;ue mea&s;ures. And what mea&s;ures, my lords? The mea&s;ures that have produ|ced the imminent perils that threaten us; the mea&s;ures that have brought ruin to our doors.</P>
<P>Can the Mini&s;ter of the day now pre&s;ume to expect a continuance of &s;upport, in this ruinous infatuation? Can Parliament be &s;o dead to its dignity and its duty, as to be thus deluded into the lo&s;s of the one, and the violation of the other? To give an unlimited credit and &s;upport for the per&s;everance in mea&s;ures, which have reduced this late flouri&s;hing empire to ruin and contempt! "But ye&s;terday, and England might have &s;tood again&s;t the world: now none &s;o poor to do her reverence." I u&s;e the words of a poet; but though it be poetry, it is no fiction. It is a &s;hameful truth, that not only the power and &s;trength of this country are wa&s;ting away and expiring; but her well-earned glories, her true honors, and &s;ub&s;tantial dignity, are &s;acrificed.</P>
<P>France, my lords, has in&s;ulted you; &s;he has encour|aged and &s;u&s;tained America; and whether America be wrong or right, the dignity of this country ought to &s;purn at the officious in&s;ult of French interference. The mini&s;ters and amba&s;&s;adors of tho&s;e who are called rebels and enemies, are in Paris; in Paris they tran&s;|act the reciprocal intere&s;ts of America and France. Can there be a more mortifying in&s;ult? Can even our mini&s;ters &s;u&s;tain a more humiliating di&s;grace? Do they dare to re&s;ent it? Do they pre&s;ume even to hint a vindication of their honor, and the dignity of the State, by requiring the di&s;mi&s;&s;al of the plenipotentiaries of America? Such is the degradation to which they have reduced the glories of England!</P>
<P>The people, whom they affect to call contemptible rebels, but who&s;e growing power has at la&s;t obtained
<PB N="264" REF="031827_0262_0FEEC5F5E0920728">
the name of enemies; the people with whom they have engaged this country in war, and again&s;t whom they now command our implicit &s;upport in every mea&s;|ure of de&s;perate ho&s;tility: this people, de&s;pi&s;ed as reb|els, or acknowledged as enemies, are abetted again&s;t you; &s;upplied with every military &s;tore; their intere&s;ts con&s;ulted, and their amba&s;&s;adors entertained, by your inveterate enemy! and our mini&s;ters dare not inter|po&s;e with dignity or effect. Is this the honor of a great kingdom? Is this the indignant &s;pirit of England, who, but ye&s;terday, gave law to the Hou&s;e of Bour|bon? My lords, the dignity of nations demands a de|ci&s;ive conduct in a &s;ituation like this.</P>
<P>This ruinous and ignominious &s;ituation, where we cannot act with &s;ucce&s;s, nor &s;uffer with honor, calls upon us to remon&s;trate in the &s;tronge&s;t and loude&s;t lan|guage of truth, to re&s;cue the ear of Maje&s;ty from the delu&s;ions which &s;urround it. The de&s;perate &s;tate of our arms abroad is in part known. No man thinks more highly of them than I do. I love and honor the En|gli&s;h troops&punc; I know they can achieve any thing except impo&s;&s;ibilities: and I know that the conque&s;t of Engli&s;h America is an impo&s;&s;ibility. You cannot, I ventu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> to &s;ay it, you CANNOT conquer America.</P>
<P>Your armies, la&s;t war, effected every thing that could be effected; and what was it? It co&s;t a numerous army, under the command of a mo&s;t able general, now a noble lord in this Hou&s;e, a long and laborious cam|paign, to expel five thou&s;and Frenchmen from French America. My lords, you CANNOT conquer Ame|rica. What is your pre&s;ent &s;ituation there? We do not know the wor&s;t; but we know, that in three campaigns we have done nothing, and &s;uffered much. We &s;hall &s;oon know, and in any event, have rea&s;on to lament, what may have happened &s;ince.</P>
<P>As to conque&s;t, therefore, my lords, I repeat, it is impo&s;&s;ible. You may &s;well every expen&s;e, and every effort, &s;till more extravagantly; pile and accumulate every a&s;&s;i&s;tance you can buy or borrow; traffic and
<PB N="265" REF="031827_0263_0FEEC65A1DB6CBD8">
barter with every little pitiful German prince, who &s;ells his &s;ubjects to the &s;hambles of a foreign power&punc; your efforts are forever vain and impotent; doubly &s;o from this mercenary aid on which you rely. For it irritates, to an incurable re&s;entment, the minds of your enemies, to overrun them with the mercenary &s;ons of rapine and plunder; devoting them and their po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions to the rapacity of hireling cruelty! If I were an American, as I am an Engli&s;hman, while a foreign troop remained in my country, I NEVER would lay down my arms; NEVER, NEVER, NEVER.</P>

IN COMMEMORATION OF AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE.</HEAD>
<P>AMERICANS! you have a country va&s;t in extent, and embracing all the varieties of the mo&s;t &s;a|lubrious climes: held not by charters wre&s;ted from un|willing kings, but the bountiful gift of the Author of nature. The exuberance of your population is daily dive&s;ting the gloomy wilderne&s;s of its rude attire, and &s;plendid cities ri&s;e to cheer the dreary de&s;art. You have a government de&s;ervedly celebrated as "giving the &s;anctions of law to the precepts of rea&s;on;" pre|&s;enting, in&s;tead of the rank luxuriance of natural licen|tiou&s;ne&s;s, the corrected &s;weets of civil liberty. You have fought the battles of freedom, and enkindled that &s;acred flame which now glows with vivid fervor through the greate&s;t empire in Europe.</P>
<P>We indulge the &s;anguine hope, that her equal laws and virtuous conduct will hereafter afford examples of imitation to all &s;urrounding nations. That the bli&s;sful period will &s;oon arrive when man &s;hall be elevated to his primitive character; when illuminated rea&s;on and regulated liberty &s;hall once more exhibit him in the image of his Maker; when all the inhabitants of the globe &s;hall be freemen and fellow-citizens, and patriot|i&s;m it&s;elf be lo&s;t in univer&s;al philanthropy.

<P>I know you have many laws on paper, and &s;ome that ought to make the paper blu&s;h. We have but few; they are founded in ju&s;tice, and written on the heart.

<P>We have both the &s;ame claim from each other; friend&s;hip and ju&s;tice are all we require. Our ideas on the&s;e &s;ubjects are different; perhaps they will never agree. On one &s;ide, ferocity will not be dictated by humanity, nor &s;tubbornne&s;s by rea&s;on; on the other, knowledge is not di&s;po&s;ed to be advi&s;ed by ignorance, nor power to &s;toop to weakne&s;s.</P>

<P>I believe we &s;hall not make peace by our talks. If the contention is, Who has the mo&s;t humanity, let him who made us judge.

<P>We love peace; we love our friends; we love all men, as much as you. When your fathers came over the big water, we treated them as brothers: they had nothing: peace and plenty were among us. All the land was ours, from the ea&s;t to the we&s;t water; from the mountains of &s;now in the north, to the burn|ing path of the &s;un in the &s;outh. They were made welcome to our land and to all we po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. To talk like White Men, they were beggars and we their ben|efactors: they were tenants at will, and we their land|lords. But we nouri&s;hed a viper in our bo&s;oms. You have poi&s;oned us by your luxury; &s;pread contention among us by your &s;ubtlety, and death by your treach|ery. The Indians have but two predominant pa&s;&s;ions, friend&s;hip and revenge. Deal with us as friends, and you may fi&s;h in our rivers or hunt in our fore&s;ts. Treat us not like &s;ervants; we &s;hall never own you as ma&s;|ters. If you provoke us, our vengeance will pur&s;ue you. We &s;hall drink your blood; you may &s;pill ours. We had rather die in honorable war, than live in di&s;|honorable peace.</P>

<HEAD>EXTRACT FROM AN ORATION, PRONOUNCED AT BOSTON,
<DATE>JULY 4, 1796.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>THAT the be&s;t way for a great empire to tax her colonies is to confer benefits upon them, and, that no rulers have a right to levy contributions upon the property, or exact the &s;ervices of their &s;ubjects, without their own, or the con&s;ent of their immediate repre&s;entatives, were principles never recognized by the mini&s;try and parliament of Great-Britain. Fatally enamoured of their &s;elfi&s;h &s;y&s;tems of policy, and ob&s;ti|nately determined <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o effect the execution of their ne|farious purpo&s;es, they were deaf to the &s;ugge&s;tions of rea&s;on and the demands of ju&s;tice. The frantic, though

tran&s;ient energy of intoxicated rage was exhibited in their every act, and blackened and di&s;torted the features of their national character.</P>
<P>On the contrary, Americans had but one object in view, for in Independence are concentrated and con|den&s;ed every ble&s;&s;ing that makes life de&s;irable, every right and every privilege which can tend to the happi|ne&s;s or &s;ecure the native dignity of man. In the at|tainment of Independence, were all their pa&s;&s;ions, their de&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">res, and their powers engaged. The intrepidity and magnanimity of their armies; the wi&s;dom and in|flexible firmne&s;s of their Congre&s;s; the ardency of their patrioti&s;m; their unrepining patience, when a&s;&s;ailed by dangers and perplexed with aggravated misfortunes, have long and de&s;ervedly employed the pen of pane|gyric and the tongue of eulogy.</P>
<P>Through the whole revolutionary conflict, a con&s;i&s;t|ency and &s;y&s;tematic regularity were pre&s;erved, equally honorable as extraordinary. The unity of de&s;ign and cla&s;&s;ically correct arrangement of the &s;eries of incidents which completed the Epic &s;tory of American Independ|ence, were &s;o wonderful, &s;o well wrought, that political Hypercritici&s;m was aba&s;hed at the mighty production, and forced to join her &s;i&s;ter Envy, in applauding the glorious compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>It is my plea&s;ing duty, my fellow-citizens, to felici|tate you on the e&s;tabli&s;hment of our national &s;overeign|ty; and among the various &s;ubjects for congratulation and rejoicing, this is not the mo&s;t unimportant, that Heaven has &s;pared &s;o many veterans in the art of war; &s;o many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ages, who are ver&s;ed in the be&s;t politics of peace; men, who are able to in&s;truct and to govern, and who&s;e faithful &s;ervices, who&s;e unremitted exer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ons to promote the public pro&s;perity, entitle them to our firm|e&s;t confidence and warme&s;t gratitude. Uniting in the celebration of this anniver&s;ary, I am happy to behold many of the illu&s;trious remnant of that band of patriots, who, de&s;pi&s;ing danger and death, determined to be free, or gloriou&s;ly peri&s;h in the cau&s;e.

beam inexpre&s;&s;ible delight! our joys are increa&s;ed by their pre&s;ence; our raptures are heightened by their participation. The feelings which in&s;pired them in the "times which tried men's &s;ouls," are communicated to our bo&s;oms. We catch the divine &s;pirit which im|pelled them to bid defiance to the congregated ho&s;t of de&s;pots. We &s;wear to pre&s;erve the ble&s;&s;ings they toiled to gain, which they obtained by the ince&s;&s;ant labors of eight di&s;tre&s;sful years; to tran&s;mit to our po&s;terity, our rights undimini&s;hed, our honor unt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ni&s;hed, and our freedom unimpaired.</P>
<P>On the la&s;t page of Fate's eventful volume, with the raptured ken of prophecy, I behold Columbia's name re|corded; her future honors and happine&s;s in&s;cribed. In the &s;ame important book the approaching end of Ty|ranny and the triumph of Right and Ju&s;tice are written in indelible characters. The &s;truggle will &s;oon be over; the tottering thrones of de&s;pots will quickly fall, and bury their proud incumbents in their ma&s;&s;y ruins!</P>

<HEAD>AN ORATION ON THE POWERS OF ELO|QUENCE, WRITTEN FOR AN EXHIBITION OF A SCHOOL IN BOSTON, 1791.</HEAD>
<P>AMIDST the profu&s;ion of intere&s;ting and brilliant objects in this a&s;&s;embly, &s;hould the &s;peaker be able

to engage the attention of a few eyes, and a few ears, he will e&s;teem his reception flattering. To another is al|lotted the plea&s;ing ta&s;k of clo&s;ing the evening, with re|marks on Female Education.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See American Preceptor, p. 47.</NOTE> It is mine to recommend the POWERS OF ELOQUENCE, and to &s;how the influence which it ju&s;tly challenges, over the &s;en&s;es, pa&s;&s;ions, and under&s;tandings of mankind.</P>
<P>Eloquence con&s;i&s;ts in a capacity of expre&s;&s;ing, by the voice, attitude, ge&s;ture, and countenance the emotions of the heart. To this art, Demo&s;thenes and Cicero owe their immortality; by this, the late Earl of Chat|ham gained his celebrity; and to this, are the great pol|iticians, now in Europe, indebted for their di&s;tinction. Eloquent men begin to be heard with attention in our Congre&s;s; pulpit orators gain crowds, and eloquent lawyers gain cau&s;es.</P>
<P>When the enlightened State&s;man is di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the intere&s;ts of a country, on which are grafted his for|tune, fame, and life, he <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be eloquent. When the general harangues a brave &s;oldiery, at the eve of a bat|tle, on which depend their liberties and lives&punc; he <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be eloquent. When the compa&s;&s;ionate lawyer, with|out hope of reward, advocates the cau&s;e of the &s;uffer|ing widow, or injured orphan, he <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be eloquent.</P>
<P>But when true Eloquence is introduced into the &s;acred de&s;k, how elevated is the &s;ubject of the pa&s;&s;ion on the cro&s;s! With what animating zeal can the preach|er call on h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s hearers, to open a high way for their God! With what rapture can he bur&s;t from the gloom of types and figures, into the brightne&s;s of that everla&s;ting Go&s;|pel which brought life and immortality to light! With what heaven-taught joy can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e hail the Star in the ea&s;t! and with what &s;emblance of reality may he lead the imaginations of his audience to a &s;ight of the babe in the manger! If he <HI>feel</HI> &s;uch &s;ubjects, he mu&s;t be elo|quent and irre&s;i&s;tible.</P>
<P>May we now look back and trace the progre&s;s and influence of Eloquence on different &s;ubjects, and at
<PB N="283" REF="031827_0281_0FEEC6750212B748">
various periods? How do we feel its power, when we hear David expre&s;&s;ing the appearing of the Highe&s;t! "He bowed the heavens al&s;o, and came down, and darkne&s;s was under his feet; he rode upon a cherub, and did fly, and he was &s;een upon the wings of the wind."</P>
<P>Who can hear, without emotion, the &s;ublime elo|quence of the prophet I&s;aiah, when he announces the future glory of the Church? "Violence &s;hall no more be heard in thy land; wa&s;ting nor de&s;truction with|in thy borders: but thou &s;halt call thy walls, Salva|tion, and thy gates Prai&s;e."</P>
<P>But in what language has the prophet Habakkuk de&s;cribed the maje&s;ty of the Creator? "Before him went the pe&s;tilence, and burning coals went forth at his feet: he &s;tood, and mea&s;ured the earth: he beheld, and drove a&s;under the nations: the everla&s;ting moun|tains were &s;cattered: the perpetual hills did bow: his ways are everla&s;ting." Let us pa&s;s in re&s;pectful &s;ilence the eloquence of him, who "&s;pake, as never man &s;pake."</P>
<P>But our attention is immediately arre&s;ted by the de|fence of Paul before Agrippa; in which he de&s;cribes a light from heaven, above the brightne&s;s of the mid-day &s;un; when he declares his conver&s;ion, and commi&s;&s;ion to be a mini&s;ter, and a witne&s;s of tho&s;e things, which he had &s;een, and of tho&s;e things, in which the Saviour would appear unto him. "Whereupon," &s;ays he, "O king Agrippa, I was not di&s;obedient unto the heav|enly vi&s;ion."</P>
<P>Nor can we fail to mention that eloquence, which made Felix tremble on his throne. Nor can we read, unmoved, Paul's &s;olemn account of the re&s;urrection; when, "In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, the dead &s;hall be rai&s;ed, and we &s;hall be changed." But when we come to the vi&s;ion on the I&s;le of Patmos, where the glory of heaven was unveiled to a man of God, we are lo&s;t in the maje&s;ty and &s;ublimity of the de&s;cription of things, which mu&s;t be hereafter; and mu&s;t clo&s;e the &s;acred &s;criptures, convinced of the irre|&s;i&s;tible

Powers of Eloquence, when employed upon di|vine &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>Among themes le&s;s intere&s;ting, is there <HI>one,</HI> on which the&s;e powers have been un&s;ucce&s;sfully employed? We read how the eloquence of one man governed all hearts in Greece, and how a&s;toni&s;hing was its effect from the immortal Orator of Rome. All civilized na|tions can furni&s;h facts and arguments on this &s;ubject. Wherever arts and &s;ciences have found a re&s;idence, oratory has been a &s;ure attendant.</P>
<P>I am obliged to pa&s;s, with regret, the characters of D'E&s;premenil, Mirabeau, Burke, Fox, Flood, and Grattan, who, within our own days, have made the Senates of three different kingdoms ring with their eloquence. With greater reluctance mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t I pa&s;s the memorable time, when all the &s;en&s;es, pa&s;&s;ions, and al|mo&s;t breath of five thou&s;and people were &s;u&s;pended at the admirable eloquence of Sheridan, while he de|&s;cribed the cruelties of Ha&s;tings on the banks of the Gan|ges; when with unfeeling madne&s;s that de&s;pot redden|ed the waters with the blood of mothers and their in|fants, and made even the river blu&s;h for the honor of the Briti&s;h name.</P>
<P>With plea&s;ure I bring my &s;ubject to the &s;cenes of my native country; and here could, with the enthu&s;ia&s;m of Columbus in his vi&s;ion, pre&s;ent before you the lofty Andes, the maje&s;tic Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, the beautiful Ohio, the falls of Niagara, and the lakes of the north. I might take a view of this country, extending through the five zones, comprehending all the climates, and pro|ducing all the varieties of the earth.</P>
<P>Our ears have heard what wonders have been wrought in United America. Our eyes &s;ee its pre&s;|ent happy &s;ituation. After many toils and convul&s;ions, we at length find our&s;elves &s;afe on the top of Nebo, and our Mo&s;es yet alive at the head of our rulers. Hence we look forward to the flattering pro&s;pects of futurity. Our orators and poets have announced ble&s;&s;|ed things in the latter days. Our prophets have
<PB N="285" REF="031827_0283_0FEEC67989CA7840">
taught us to expect the reality of golden dreams. The leaves of our future hi&s;tory are gilded, and the pages are left to be filled up, with the actions of a long li&s;t of <HI>unambitious</HI> Ce&s;ars.</P>
<P>We are told, that on this our native &s;pot of earth, &s;lavi&s;h government and &s;lavi&s;h hierarchies &s;hall cea&s;e; that here, the old prophecies &s;hall be verified; that here &s;hall be the la&s;t, univer&s;al empire on earth, the empire of rea&s;on and virtue; under which the go&s;pel of peace &s;hall have free cour&s;e and be glorified; that here the wolf &s;hall dwell with the lamb, and the leop|ard with the kid, and that nation &s;hall no more lift up &s;word again&s;t nation.</P>
<P>When the philo&s;opher of the ea&s;t fore&s;aw the beauty and excellence of this we&s;tern continent, its immen&s;e rivers, lakes, and mountains; cities ri&s;ing from the mid&s;t of de&s;olation; "men like trees walking," where once were the haunts of &s;avage bea&s;ts; arts and man|ners improving; the ro&s;e budding in the de&s;art, and the flowers of the garden in the &s;olitary place, rich in|deed was the pro&s;pect. But <HI>his</HI> vi&s;ions have become <HI>our</HI> realities. We live to enjoy ble&s;&s;ings, more numer|ous than Columbus could count.</P>
<P>We &s;ee &s;chools, academies, and colleges, opening their trea&s;ures to every family; and are taught, that religion, liberty, and &s;cience, are con&s;tellations in the heavens, which, amid&s;t the revolution of empires, vi&s;it, in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, all the kingdoms and people of the earth. We &s;ee one half of the world involved in darkne&s;s, and oblivious &s;leep; while the other is enjoying the ble&s;&s;ings of day, and of vigilant indu&s;try.</P>
<P>The day of American glory has at length dawned. No more &s;hall meteors of the air, and in&s;ects with gild|ed wings, lead a&s;tray the benighted traveller, nor the bleaking buzzards of the night tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">umph over the bird of Jove. Prejudice, ignorance, and tyranny, are flying on the wings of the wind. While this day is ours, let us be up and doing.</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="031827_0284_0FEEC62901151D68">May I now introduce my &s;ubject within the&s;e walls? And here, how exten&s;ive is the theme for my feeble powers of Eloquence! yet may I employ them, in &s;ug|ge&s;ting the motives which your &s;ons and daughters have to cultivate their minds. Gratitude to their parents; your patronage; their own ambition; their pro&s;pects of future profit, u&s;efulne&s;s, and hone&s;t fame, are among the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>But highly important is rendered this morning of life and privilege to us, from a con&s;ideration, that we are born in the be&s;t of countries, at the be&s;t of times. While &s;ome of the human race are &s;uffering the ex|treme heats of burning zones, and others are freezing beyond the influence of benignant rays, we live in a climate, temperate, &s;alubrious, and healthful. While &s;ome inherit from their parents poverty and &s;lavery, we are the heirs of private, public, and &s;ocial benefits.</P>
<P>Our eyes have been opened in a country, where the Father of mercies has been plea&s;ed to conden&s;e his ble&s;&s;|ings. On us beams the &s;un of Science: ours is the hemi&s;phere of Freedom: here are enjoyed THE RIGHTS OF MAN; and upon us &s;hine, with cea&s;ele&s;s &s;plendor, the rays of the STAR OF BETHLEHEM.</P>
<P>Ble&s;t in the di&s;pen&s;ations of nature, providence, and grace, on us depends a faithful improvement of our nu|merous talents. Early taught the &s;hortne&s;s and value of life, and the importance of improving each hour of youth, while we have lei&s;ure, and the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of in|&s;tructors, we early learn to be diligent. Ob&s;erving, that with our parents, the &s;hadows of the evening be|gin to lengthen, and that &s;oon the wheel will cea&s;e to turn round at the ci&s;tern; that &s;oon they mu&s;t leave us, and that we mu&s;t fill their places, we learn to be am|bitious and emulous to excel. But beyond the&s;e, we have, with all other children of the univer&s;e, an argu|ment &s;till higher to improve the&s;e precious days. We live not only for our&s;elves, for our parents, friends, and country; but for the G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ver of life: we live for immor|tality. Young as we are, and ju&s;t entered the bark of
<PB N="287" REF="031827_0285_0FEEC67F2B0AB8F8">
being; yet like you, we are on a boundle&s;s ocean, and an eternal voyage.</P>
<P>As ELOQUENCE is my theme, perhaps I may be indulged in dwelling for the few remaining moments, on this la&s;t mo&s;t intere&s;ting &s;ubject. While enjoying the ble&s;&s;ings of health, and the fe&s;tivities of youth, we &s;tand on this bridge of life, carele&s;s of the rapid cur|rents of ye&s;terdays and to-morrows; yet reflection teaches that the hour is rapidly ha&s;tening, when "the cloud-capt towers; the gorgeous palaces; the &s;olemn temples; yea, the great globe it&s;elf, with all which it inherits, &s;hall di&s;&s;olve, and like the ba&s;ele&s;s fabric of a vi&s;ion, leave not a wreck behind." We &s;hall &s;urvive.</P>
<P>Though the lo&s;s of parents and friends; though the frequent infirmities and vici&s;&s;itudes of life, teach us gloomily to reflect, that "An angel's arm can't &s;natch us from the grave;" yet a &s;ure pro&s;pect of a re&s;urrec|tion to cea&s;ele&s;s life, bids us &s;ay with triumph, "Legions of angels can't confine us there." We look back on the ages which have pa&s;&s;ed, and &s;ee the millions of men, who, &s;ince the days of Adam, have been laid in the du&s;t. We &s;ee nine hundred and fifty millions of ra|tional beings, now in full life, who mu&s;t in a few years, be cold and in death; and in every day of our lives, no le&s;s than eighty-&s;ix thou&s;and of the human race, are laid in the grave. What oceans of tears have been &s;hed by &s;urviving friends!</P>
<P>How have mourning, lamentation, and woe been heard not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ly in Rama, but throughout every quar|ter of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">habited earth! We contemplate the time, when th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e bodies of ours, now full of life and motion, &s;hall be cold. We elevate our thoughts to that &s;cene, when the elements &s;hall melt with fervent heat; when the &s;un &s;hall be darkened, and the moon no more give light: when the &s;tars of heaven &s;hall fall from their places, and all nature be tumbling into ruins.</P>
<P>Then the trump of God &s;hall &s;ound; then &s;hall he, who once &s;aid, "Lazarus, come forth," de&s;cend from heaven, with a mighty &s;hout. Then, &s;hall the
<PB REF="031827_0286_0FEEC62C18AF1398">
dead hear the voice of the Son of God; then &s;hall they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;t the bands of death, and ri&s;e, never to &s;leep again. Then &s;hall this mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tal put on immortality, and death be &s;wallowed up of life.</P>
<P>We &s;hall be pre&s;ent at this augu&s;t re&s;urrection! Soon &s;hall we cea&s;e to &s;ee the blue canopy of the day, and the &s;tarred curtain of the night; to hear the rolling of the thunder, or &s;ee the lightning of the heavens; &s;cenes, which now impre&s;s us with awe and delight. We look round creation, and &s;ee all living nature, be|low our rank, di&s;&s;olving to du&s;t; never to revive. We &s;ee the flowers of &s;pring die, and the leaves of autumn fade; never to re&s;ume their beauty and verdure. But contemplating the &s;oul of man, we are led to the lan|guage of the poet,
<Q><L>"See truth, love, and mercy in triumph de&s;cending,</L>
<L>And nature all glowing in Eden's fir&s;t bloom,</L>
<L>On the cold cheek of death &s;miles and ro&s;es are blending,</L>
<L>And beauty immortal awakes from the tomb."</L></Q></P>
<P>This &s;ubject, it&s;elf &s;o full of Eloquence, is al&s;o full of in&s;truction and argument. Whatever elevates the dig|nity of our natures, and extends our views, teaches us to live; daily to improve our minds; daily to better our hearts. May ELOQUENCE ever be improved in the cau&s;e of learning and virtue; ever employed in ad|dre&s;&s;ing important truths to the mind, in a mo&s;t forcible and expre&s;&s;ive manner.</P>
<P>May the daughters of America wear their charms, as attendants on their virtue, the &s;atel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> their in|nocence, and the ornament of their &s;ex.
