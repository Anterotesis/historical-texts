<BIBL><HI>GENESIS</HI> xxviii. 17.</BIBL>
<Q>This is none other but the hou&s;e of GOD; and this is the gate of Heaven.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>A BELIEF in the exi&s;tence of God, and in his intercour&s;e with rational creatures, has pervaded all ages and nations. Every temple that has been built, every victim that has been &s;lain, all the rites of pagani&s;m, and all the in&s;titutions of Chri&s;|tianity, bear te&s;timony in favour of this a&s;&s;ertion. The various and oppo&s;ite methods in which men have attempted to approach God, to render him their wor&s;hip and to receive his favours, evince that they were ignorant of their true &s;tate by na|ture, of the divine attributes, and of the great Mediator, through whom all ble&s;&s;ings de&s;cend. In&s;piration a&s;&s;ures us, that <Q>there is one God, and one Mediator between God and men, the man Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</Q> 1 Tim. ii. 5. Through him every true Chri&s;tian, wor&s;hipping in &s;pirit and in truth, looks up to God as his parent, and receives di|vine
<PB N="6" REF="030780_0005_0FE9253FF98A31B0">
favours. Intercour&s;e in this way with God, is a peculiar privilege of every real believer, and a di&s;tingui&s;hing trait in his character. It marks his progre&s;s through life. It bears him above im|moderate attachment to earthly, peri&s;hable objects, &s;ublimes his &s;oul, invigorates his affections, en|larges his capacity of enjoyment, and qualifies him for the &s;ervice of heaven. While he &s;its under the &s;hadow of the Almighty, his ravi&s;hed &s;oul, &s;trug|gling with exta&s;y, bur&s;ts from her confines of clay, joining with <Q>angels, and the &s;pirits of the ju&s;t made perfect.</Q> His religion is not founded on conjecture; it is no Idle formality, no uninte|re&s;ting &s;peculation; but it is a truth, a &s;ub&s;tance, a heart-felt reality, a heaven on earth. All the operations of the divine &s;pirit, in regeneration, repentance, faith, &s;anctification and communion with God, are indications of his favour, and in|conte&s;tible evidences of the reality of vital piety. Though rea&s;on abundantly confirms the divine ori|ginal of the Chri&s;tian religion, and points it out as the only road to glory; yet rea&s;on is by no means the chief &s;ource from which believers in general derive their a&s;&s;urance and con&s;olation. They a&s;|&s;ent, becau&s;e they realize. They believe, becau&s;e they feel. They re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, becau&s;e they have the evidence of their internal &s;en&s;es. <Q>He that believeth on the Son of God, hath the witne&s;s in him&s;elf.</Q> 1 John, v. 10. He who has been brought by the power of God to a cordial reception of the go&s;pel, can no more doubt the reality of religion, than he can the exi&s;tence of the material world. In both ca&s;es he relies on the ve|racity of his &s;en&s;ible experience. How ab&s;urd then and vain is it, for tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s no real
<PB N="7" REF="030780_0006_0FE9251B14D2A0A0">
knowledge of religion, to repre&s;ent it as a phantom, a cheat, or delu&s;ion! With the &s;ame propriety might a deaf man deny the exi&s;tence of &s;ound, or a blind man the exi&s;tence of light and colours. Chri&s;|tians, in all ages and countries, have the happine&s;s to "know in whom they have believed." God is limited neither by time nor place. He often comes &s;en&s;ibly near to his people by day and by night, on the ocean or on the land, in the populous city or in the lonely de&s;ert. Behold Jacob, taking leave of his aged father, flying from the rage of an in|cen&s;ed brother, having no one to accompany him through a &s;trange country. The &s;un falls beneath the horizon. Darkne&s;s &s;preads over the earth, and muffles up the &s;ky. Jacob in the open air lays his head upon a &s;tone. He &s;leeps. In this expo&s;ed and &s;olitary &s;tate, his heavenly Father meets him, and fills him with con&s;olation. God &s;ays to him, <Q>behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goe&s;t.</Q> And Jacob awaked out of his &s;leep, and &s;aid, <Q>&s;urely the Lord is in this place, and I knew it not.&mdash;How dread|ful is this place! This is none other but the hou&s;e of God, and this is the gate of heaven.</Q>&mdash;You will plea&s;e to ob&s;erve that Jacob utters the&s;e words while his heart is filled with a lively &s;en&s;e of God's pre&s;ence. It is on this account that he calls the place in which he was the hou&s;e of God, and the gate of heaven. It is on the &s;ame account that the &s;criptures repre&s;ent the church as the hou&s;e of God. I propo&s;e, therefore, on the pre&s;ent occa|&s;ion, to accommodate the words of the text to the meaning of tho&s;e phra&s;es in the &s;criptures, which &s;peak of the church as an habitation for God. In di&s;|cu&s;&s;ing the &s;ubject pre&s;ented in the text, I &s;hall in the

I. Fir&s;t place, &s;hew what con&s;titutes a church that may be &s;tyled the hou&s;e of God.</P>
<P>II. In the &s;econd place, con&s;ider the church as a &s;tate preparatory for heaven.</P>
<P>A few ob&s;ervations &s;hall then conclude the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I. I &s;hall in the fir&s;t place &s;hew what con&s;titutes a church that may be &s;tyled the hou&s;e of God.</P>
<P>Under this head, I do not propo&s;e to point out all the particular things nece&s;&s;ary to the organiza|tion, in&s;truction, and government of a church; but the nature of it, con&s;idered as an habitation for God. A church con&s;i&s;ts of a number of real be|lievers in Chri&s;t, united together under his laws, for the wor&s;hip and &s;ervice of God. The follow|ing are &s;ome of the leading traits in their charac|ters:</P>
<P N="1">1. They have experienced regeneration. This is expre&s;&s;ed in the &s;criptures by various phra&s;es, tending to point out its greatne&s;s and importance. Chri&s;t repre&s;ented it under the notion of a birth, when he &s;aid to Nicodemus, <Q>except a man be born again, he cannot &s;ee the kingdom of God.</Q> Paul repre&s;ented it as <Q>the putting off and cruci|fixion of the old man, as the de&s;truction of the body of &s;in, as a re&s;toration from death, as a re|novation of the &s;pirit of the mind, as a new cre|ation.</Q> The nece&s;&s;ity of this change originates in the depravity and &s;infulne&s;s of the human heart. The&s;e are abundantly te&s;tified of in the &s;criptures, and confirmed by the conduct of men in all ages and nations. The te&s;timony of eternal truth is, that men have all gone out of the way; that there is none that doeth good; that there is no fear of God before their eyes; that they de&s;ire not the know|ledge of his ways; that they have come &s;hort of his
<PB N="9" REF="030780_0008_0FE925232B875750">
glory; that the carnal mind is enmity again&s;t God; that every thought of the imagination of man's heart is evil, and that continually. The&s;e expre&s;&s;ions convey an idea of the greate&s;t alienation of heart from God and holine&s;s. Though all men are &s;in|ners, yet all are not equally criminal, ob&s;tinate and incorrigible. All, however, are by nature in &s;uch a &s;tate as to need a renovation of heart to &s;it them for the hou&s;e of God, and the enjoyment of heav|en. He who&s;e &s;oul is the haunt of wickedne&s;s, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions are the vile minions of riot and de|bauchery, who&s;e life is a catalogue of &s;ins; he can be rouzed from his lethargy by nothing but the loude&s;t thunders of Sinai, and be changed to holi|ne&s;s by nothing but the re&s;i&s;tle&s;s arm of the Al|mighty. The e&s;&s;ence of this change con&s;i&s;ts neither in the illumination of the under&s;tanding, nor in the reception of any new faculties; but in the infu&s;ion of a holy di&s;po&s;ition, prompting to holy exerci&s;es of heart and conduct in life. The great work of regeneration is by the &s;criptures uniformly a&s;cribed to the Holy Spirit, as the immediate agent. Thus &s;aid Chri&s;t, <Q>except a man be born of the Spirit, he cannot &s;ee the kingdom of God. That which is born of the Spirit, is &s;pirit.</Q> John iii. 5, 6. John, &s;peaking of tho&s;e who received Chri&s;t, &s;ays they were <Q>born not of blood, nor of the will of the fle&s;h, nor of the will of man, but of God.</Q> John i. 13. Paul to the Corinthians &s;ays, <Q>we all beholding as in a gla&s;s the glory of the Lord, are changed into the &s;ame image, from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.</Q> 2 Cor. iii. 18. Paul to Titus &s;ays of God, <Q>he &s;aved us by the wa&s;hing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Gho&s;t.</Q> Tit. iii. 5. The Spirit of
<PB N="10" REF="030780_0009_0FE9255033ACF548">
God &s;heds abroad his love in the heart, and con|veys to it the &s;ame kind of di&s;po&s;ition which re|&s;ides in him&s;elf. Hence he who is regenerated, is united to God in love. <Q>For God is love, and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.</Q> 1 John, iv. 16. Hence it is, that all who are regenerated, <Q>are built up a &s;pi|ritual hou&s;e.</Q> None but &s;uch can properly be|long to it and con&s;titute an habitation for the liv|ing God. Thus regeneration appears to be an e&s;|&s;ential trait in the character of true members, who form a church that may be &s;tyled the hou&s;e of God.</P>
<P N="2">2. The next trait in their character is, that they have true repentance for &s;in. This is indi&s;pen&s;i|bly nece&s;&s;ary to pardon and &s;alvation. This was the uniform language of John the Bapti&s;t, of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and his apo&s;tles. John <Q>preached the bapti&s;m of repentance for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins.</Q> Je&s;us taught <Q>that repentance and remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins &s;hould be preached in his name among all na|tions.</Q> The apo&s;tles preached the &s;ame doc|trine, when they &s;aid, <Q>repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Chri&s;t, for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins.</Q> Evangelical repentance con|&s;i&s;ts not in occa&s;ional pangs of remor&s;e, horrors of con&s;cience, or re&s;olutions to amend. If it does, then a Judas, a Felix, and a Herod, mu&s;t be num|bered with the pious, and be enrolled on the li&s;t of &s;alvation. There are &s;carcely any, who, at &s;ome period of their lives, have not been alarmed with fearful apprehen&s;ions for the con&s;equences of &s;in, have reformed their conduct, and implored forgive|ne&s;s of God. The&s;e things they may have done, and yet be entire &s;trangers to true repentance. This penetrates the inmo&s;t retirements of the heart. It
<PB N="11" REF="030780_0010_0FE9255359E5EDB8">
con&s;i&s;ts in a holy di&s;gu&s;t of &s;in, con&s;idered as a mo&s;t heinous crime again&s;t God, and prompts the true penitent not merely to view &s;inful actions with ab|horrence, but to trace them up to their origin, and di&s;clo&s;e all the &s;ecret rece&s;&s;es of wickedne&s;s. Even when his conduct is fair and unblameable in the eyes of the world, he laments over the depravity of his heart. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a deep and affecting &s;en&s;e of the intrin&s;ic evil of &s;in; and oppo&s;es it, not merely becau&s;e it expo&s;es to puni&s;hment, not mere|ly becau&s;e it would injure his character, and &s;quan|der his e&s;tate, but chiefly becau&s;e he views it to be vile in its own nature, ruinous to his peace in its tendency, di&s;honourable to God, rebellion again&s;t his authority, oppo&s;ition to his holine&s;s and goodne&s;s. That repentance cannot be con&s;idered as genuine, which does not produce a uniform di&s;|gu&s;t of all &s;in, in every kind and degree; while it prompts to an invincible per&s;everance in every known duty, and an humble dependence on the mercy of God, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Repentance, as it implies an entire change of motives, feelings and actions, re&s;pecting &s;in, is an indi&s;pen&s;ible pre|requi&s;ite to the enjoyment of God and heaven. Salvation without it, appears highly irrational and ab&s;urd. For God to receive one without repent|ance, would be to receive one as a friend whom he knew to be an enemy. Hence it appears nece&s;&s;a|ry, that all who belong to God's hou&s;e, &s;hould have true repentance for &s;in.</P>
<P N="3">3. Another trait in their character is, that they po&s;&s;e&s;s true evangelical faith. By this we are to under&s;tand a firm per&s;ua&s;ion of all revealed truth; a per&s;ua&s;ion effected in the under&s;tanding by di|vine te&s;timony, and wrought into the heart by the
<PB N="12" REF="030780_0011_0FE92570630076E8">
influences of the Divine Spirit. Hence it appears, that genuine faith is no dormant unintere&s;ting prin|ciple, leaving the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or in a &s;tate of languor and indifference; but active, producing good works, a&s;&s;uring of ju&s;tification and eternal life. Paul &s;ays, <Q>faith is the &s;ub&s;tance of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not &s;een.</Q> According to this definition, it appears to be a kind of divine internal &s;en&s;e, diffu&s;ing it&s;elf into futurity, con|ver&s;ing with di&s;tant invi&s;ible objects, bringing them home into pre&s;ent enjoyment, &s;ub&s;tantiating them to the mind, and laying a firm and immovea|ble foundation for hope. Evangelical faith has more immediate reference to Chri&s;t in his various offices; to all parts of his work as Mediator, Re|deemer and Saviour; to his righteou&s;ne&s;s as the only ground of acceptance with God; to divine mercy through Chri&s;t; for the pardon of &s;in; for the &s;anctification of the heart; for growth in heav|enly life; for complete deliverance from evil, and in &s;tatement in eternal beatitude. Hence the &s;crip|tures repre&s;ent faith as "working by love." No wonder that it does; for it brings into view God's mo&s;t holy character in the great &s;cheme of redemp|tion by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and de&s;cries all the glorious realities of the heavenly &s;tate. When the heart is reconciled by divine grace, the &s;oul not only ap|prehends God's character, but approves it, loves and admires it, as infinitely excellent, and longs to be changed into the &s;ame image. Faith works by love towards men. It di&s;plays it&s;elf in kind benevolent affection, e&s;pecially to <Q>the hou&s;ehold of faith.</Q> It embraces, "with arms of love," all good men of every denomination, and views them as children of God, and heirs of glory. The
<PB N="13" REF="030780_0012_0FE9257379CD4590">
&s;criptures repre&s;ent faith as "purifying the heart." This effect appears nece&s;&s;arily to re&s;ult from its nature. We are &s;o con&s;tituted, as readily to a&s;&s;i|milate our&s;elves to tho&s;e objects about which we are conver&s;ant. As faith brings into our view and enjoyment things heavenly and holy, it changes us "into their image, from glory to glory." Victory over the world is another effect a&s;cribed to faith. <Q>This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.</Q> As faith brings into view things of eternal weight and importance, the world, with all its pomp and pageantry, recedes and dwin|dles to a point. The &s;oul ri&s;es above it, and &s;oar|ing towards the divine nature, is lo&s;t in its immen|&s;ity and glory. Thus it appears that faith is an ex|alted grace, and fits its &s;ubjects for the hou&s;e of God.</P>
<P N="4">4. Another trait in their character is, devoted|ne&s;s of heart to God. This implies a cordial ap|probation of his character, laws and government. As all true religion is &s;eated in the heart, the &s;ource of action and virtue, devotedne&s;s of heart implies a con&s;tant obedience of all the affections to the divine will, and an external practical ob&s;erv|ance of all the duties, religious and moral. He who has been born from above, who&s;e heart has been filled with &s;incere godly &s;orrow for &s;in, who depends for &s;alvation entirely on the mercy of God in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, con&s;iders him&s;elf not as his own, but as "bought with a price;" and endeavours to glorify God in body and &s;pirit. He does not con|&s;ider religion as a ta&s;k, but as a plea&s;ure. He finds that the Saviour's <Q>yoke is ea&s;y, and his burthen light.</Q> He rejoices to po&s;&s;e&s;s religion
<PB N="14" REF="030780_0013_0FE92578D08C4078">
in his heart, purifying his affections, and &s;itting him for the hou&s;e of God.</P>
<P N="5">5. Another trait in the character of tho&s;e who compo&s;e the true church, &s;tyled the hou&s;e of God, is, that God's glory is the highe&s;t object in their view and regard. His nature is the &s;um of all ex|cellence and perfection. It contains every thing that can attract the affections, excite the admiration, and call forth the prai&s;es of all holy beings. <Q>God is love.</Q> With this all his actions, and all his treatment of rational creatures, will perfectly cor|re&s;pond. For God can do nothing contrary to him&s;elf. All his arrangements and operations, in the great works of creation, in the great kingdoms of providence and grace, are calculated to effect a perfect di&s;play of his true character, and to &s;ecure the highe&s;t happine&s;s of the rational univer&s;e. A di&s;play of God's true character is his glory. Tho&s;e then who are real friends to God, mu&s;t feel a di&s;|po&s;ition to coincide with all his de&s;igns and opera|tions.</P>
<P N="6">6. Another trait in their character is, that they &s;trive for higher attainments in the divine life. The principle of this is implanted in the heart in re|generation. Under the influences of the Holy Spi|rit, it is increa&s;ed and brought forth in all its ope|rations. This life implies an inward propen&s;ity to holine&s;s, and a divine activity in all the powers of the &s;oul. It is, in its nature, tendency and effects, utterly oppo&s;ed to &s;in. It implies an elevation of the affections towards God, and a progre&s;&s;ive ad|vancement towards heaven. <Q>It is a well of wa|ter, &s;pringing up into everla&s;ting life.</Q> It is communicated from Chri&s;t to all his &s;incere di&s;ci|ples. They look to him as the exhau&s;tle&s;s foun|tain,
<PB N="15" REF="030780_0014_0FE9257D72E69420">
and eagerly anticipate the glorious period when they &s;hall be changed into his image, and &s;a|tiated with his fulne&s;s.</P>
<P>Various other things enter into the character of tho&s;e who are real members of the hou&s;e of God. Tho&s;e I have enumerated appear the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential. For all who have experienced them, feel united to|gether, and when wor&s;hipping their common Parent and Saviour, are &s;en&s;ible of his pre&s;ence, and can exclaim, <Q>this is none other but the hou&s;e of God, and this is the gate of heaven.</Q></P>
<P>II. I now proceed, in the &s;econd place, to con|&s;ider the church as a preparatory &s;tate for heaven.</P>
<P>The de&s;ign of religion is to meliorate the hearts, reform the manners, and &s;ave the &s;ouls of men. For the&s;e important ends, Je&s;us de&s;cended from heaven, and founded the church on that rock, again&s;t which the gates of hell &s;hall not prevail. His de|&s;ign was to purify the hearts of men, in a &s;tate of di&s;cipline and enjoyment, and thus prepare them for the &s;ublime delights of heaven. That we may view the &s;tate of the church in the pre&s;ent world as preparatory for happine&s;s and glory in the next, we need but con&s;ider them in a comparative point of light.</P>
<P N="1">1. If we con&s;ider the church as a &s;tate of &s;ociety, it will appear preparatory for heaven. In this point of view, it appears peculiarly accommodat|ed to man, as a rational, communicative being. Not only his nece&s;&s;ities and dependencies, but his natural in&s;tincts, impel him into &s;ociety. Neither the beauties of nature, nor the inventions of art, can di&s;&s;ipate the gloom, nor alleviate the irk&s;ome|ne&s;s, of perpetual &s;olitude. The plea&s;ures of &s;o|cial intercour&s;e hold an elevated rank in the &s;cale
<PB N="16" REF="030780_0015_0FE9258572A32668">
of man's enjoyments. They expand his affections, enlarge his capacity, refine his nature, and learn him to guide his conduct by the rules of decency and propriety. If &s;uch are the effects and enjoy|ments re&s;ulting from the &s;ociety of men po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing different inclinations, pur&s;uing different objects, and aiming at different ends&mdash;what that is truly ex|cellent, amiable and delightful, may we not expect from the &s;ociety of tho&s;e, who imbibe the &s;ame &s;pi|rit, po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;ame moral temper, join in the &s;ame wor&s;hip, and &s;trive for the &s;ame heaven? Men in a church &s;tate are united by the neare&s;t ties; ties founded in love. <Q>Being knit together in love, they hold the head from which all the body, by joints and bands, having nouri&s;hment mini&s;tered, increa&s;eth with the increa&s;e of God.</Q> Col. ii. 2, 19. Heaven appears to be the continuance and perfection of that happine&s;s which is begun in the &s;ocial &s;tate of the church on earth. Here we are &s;urrounded with numerous imperfections, liable to many difficulties and animo&s;ities; but in heaven, the&s;e will cea&s;e; perfect union will take place; a more exten&s;ive &s;ociety will commence; the affec|tions will be enlarged beyond all bounds; all hearts will leap with exta&s;y; each, happy in it&s;elf, and in that <Q>great multitude, which no man can num|ber, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues.</Q> Thus the church &s;tate, in the pre&s;ent world, con&s;idered as a &s;ociety, appears to be the gate of heaven.</P>
<P N="2">2. The church, con&s;idered as a &s;tate of progre&s;|&s;ion in knowledge and holine&s;s, is preparatory for heaven.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have experienced the great change of regeneration, are brought to a particular know|ledge

of God, and in a degree a&s;&s;imilated to his nature. In the&s;e con&s;i&s;ts the highe&s;t excellency of the Chri&s;tian religion. It imparts to men the di&s;|po&s;itions and moral qualities of God. The&s;e at fir&s;t are drawn in &s;mall characters, but under the light of truth, they enlarge and ri&s;e into view, till Deity &s;tands confe&s;&s;ed in man. <Q>We all, with open face, beholding as in a gla&s;s the glory of the Lord, are changed into the &s;ame image.</Q> 2 Cor. iii. 18. That men in the pre&s;ent ob&s;cure and &s;inful &s;tate need &s;ome particular knowledge of God, and &s;ome change of their moral temper into his likene&s;s, before they can be prepared to enjoy him, is a truth too rea&s;onable and obvious to re|quire much illu&s;tration. The church &s;tate is a di&s;|pen&s;ation of light and holine&s;s, by which men are trained up as in a family, under one common pa|rent, and fitted for heaven. It is by the go&s;pel only, that men can acquire true and &s;aving know|ledge of God. By the works of creation they may learn his exi&s;tence, power, wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s; by the law of Mo&s;es they may learn his holine&s;s, ju&s;tice, and oppo&s;ition to &s;in; but it is by the go&s;pel only that they learn his mercy, in the forgivene&s;s of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and in the &s;alvation of the &s;oul. In Chri&s;t they behold him under the endearing cha|racter of Father. Under him, they are here in a church &s;tate trained up as his children, growing in his knowledge, forming into his likene&s;s, and looking forward to the man&s;ions of glory. Know|ledge of God appears to be an indi&s;pen&s;ible pre|requi&s;ite to eternal life. Chri&s;t &s;ays, <Q>this is life eternal, that they might know thee, the only true God, and Je&s;us Chri&s;t, whom thou ha&s;t &s;ent.</Q> John xvii. 3. From the &s;criptures it appears, that
<PB N="18" REF="030780_0017_0FE9258F65DB96E0">
the knowledge and enjoyment of Chri&s;t will con&s;ti|tute an e&s;&s;ential part of the happine&s;s of the &s;aints in heaven. They will &s;ee him as he is; they will dwell with him; he will lead them by the waters of life; he will be their everla&s;ting light and glory. In the&s;e re&s;pects the hou&s;e of God appears to be the gate of heaven; for all its inhabitants know and enjoy Chri&s;t. They receive him as God and man, as a prophet to in&s;truct them, as a friend to increa&s;e their con&s;olations, as a king to reign over them, and protect them from all their enemies. <Q>They grow in grace, and in the knowledge of their Lord and Saviour.</Q> They have a &s;pecial knowledge of the Holy Spirit, illuminating their under&s;tandings, &s;anctifying their hearts, a&s;&s;uring them of pardon, ju&s;tification and eternal life. They will pa&s;s on from one degree of improvement to another, till they &s;hall be u&s;hered into the full en|joyment of eternal beatitude. Various other cir|cum&s;tances might be mentioned, and con&s;iderations adduced, to pre&s;ent the church as preparatory for heaven; but the narrow limits pre&s;cribed by the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, urge me to fini&s;h this &s;ubject with &s;ome ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P N="1">1. From the fir&s;t part of this di&s;cour&s;e, we learn what are the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential traits in the character of tho&s;e who are fit to become members of the hou&s;e or church of God; and con&s;equently, that if we admit tho&s;e of di&s;&s;imilar character, we deviate from Chri&s;tianity and vital religion. For if we con&s;ider tho&s;e as belonging to the hou&s;e of God who have not been born from above, we con&s;ider tho&s;e to be fit to wor&s;hip him, who, according to the declaration of Chri&s;t, cannot enter his king|dom. How then could a church, compo&s;ed of
<PB N="19" REF="030780_0018_0FE92590F3B61538">
&s;uch characters, be con&s;idered as the temple of God, or the gate of heaven? How could tho&s;e be &s;it to enjoy God in that holy man&s;ion, who on earth had no delight in him? The requirements of the go&s;pel are all rea&s;onable and con&s;i&s;tent, &s;uited to the nature of God, and the &s;tate of man. Men are required to repent, becau&s;e this reconciles them to God, and leads them to view &s;in as God views it. Men are required to exerci&s;e faith in Chri&s;t, becau&s;e this implies an acknowledgment of him in all his characters, works and offices; and con&s;equently a cordial approbation of &s;alvation through his me|diation. Men are required to devote their whole hearts to God, to do all things for his glory, and &s;trive for heaven. How rea&s;onable are the&s;e things! If complied with, how conducive to our happine&s;s! How can we expect to enjoy God, un|le&s;s we love him &s;upremely? Heaven, to an im|penitent heart, would be like the riche&s;t banquet to the &s;ick. Is it not then of the greate&s;t impor|tance for us to enquire whether we are born from above? Whether we &s;incerely repent of our &s;ins? Whether we &s;trive to oppo&s;e the wickedne&s;s of our hearts? Whether we receive and approve the Sa|viour? Whether we depend on him for &s;alvation and eternal life? Unle&s;s we do the&s;e things, we de|lude our&s;elves, if we entertain hopes of heaven. For common &s;en&s;e teaches us, that we cannot en|joy an object, unle&s;s our di&s;po&s;ition be a&s;&s;imilated to its nature. How then ought our attention to be excited, that we be reconciled to God? Will nei|ther the terrors of eternal darkne&s;s, nor the charms of eternal light, rou&s;e us from our lethargy? Shall Je&s;us dive&s;t him&s;elf of his heavenly radiance? Shall he de&s;cend to earth in the form of a &s;ervant? Shall
<PB N="20" REF="030780_0019_0FE92597ACE5A318">
he agonize and die upon the cro&s;s? Shall he de|&s;cend into the dreary man&s;ions of the grave, and de|throne the king of terrors? Shall he a&s;cend on high, amid&s;t the &s;houts of admiring angels, and fling wide open the gates of Paradi&s;e for men? Shall he di&s;clo&s;e to our view the ever-verdant tree of life, bending with the food of archangels, and &s;preading its branches for the <Q>healing of the na|tions?</Q> Shall the glorious Saviour do all the&s;e things for us, and we remain unmoved and im|penitent? God forbid. Let us receive him as our Lord and Ma&s;ter. We &s;hall then look towards heaven as our proper re&s;idence. We &s;hall antici|pate its joys, and triumph over the ruins of &s;in. We &s;hall leap with plea&s;ure at the approach of our emancipation. Our hearts will expand with rap|ture in the pro&s;pect of that period, when the Sa|viour, &s;tanding amid&s;t his ran&s;omed millions, &s;hall lift the &s;word of victory, and the pale hor&s;e of death &s;hall &s;hrink into darkne&s;s&mdash;never, never to &s;trike his houghs in the vale of immortality! Then will an ocean of love, broad as the circuit of the &s;pheres, roll down from the throne of God, and bear off the redeemed multitude to that delightful country, where &s;in, and pain, and death, and &s;orrow, never had a name.</P>
<P N="2">2. The &s;econd ob&s;ervation which I make from the preceding di&s;cour&s;e is, that if the church is a &s;tate de&s;igned by God, and calculated to prepare men for heaven, the maintenance of public wor&s;hip mu&s;t be of the highe&s;t importance. In the ordinary cour&s;e of Divine Providence, we are not to ex|pect that men will become virtuous and good, with|out the means of in&s;truction and information.
<PB N="21" REF="030780_0020_0FE9259B02200970">
God appears, in all things re&s;pecting this world, to operate by &s;econdary cau&s;es. In all the means which he has e&s;tabli&s;hed in the mini&s;tration of the go&s;pel, there appears to be a tendency to holine&s;s and virtue. If this be not the ca&s;e, why are the means appointed? If there be not greater proba|bility that tho&s;e who hear the go&s;pel will become good, than there is that tho&s;e who do not hear it will, why is it to be preached? If men expect to be &s;aved by the go&s;pel, they mu&s;t attend its mini&s;tration. <Q>For faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</Q> We mu&s;t a&s;&s;em|ble for the wor&s;hip of God and enquire in his temple. If God point out the road to heaven, and we refu&s;e to walk in it, can we without the greate&s;t ab&s;urdity expect to arrive in that happy man&s;ion? As rea&s;onably might we expect, that by de&s;cending into the earth we &s;hould light upon the &s;un, or be|come companions of the &s;tars.&mdash;Your exertions in this place for the e&s;tabli&s;hment and &s;upport of pub|lic wor&s;hip, evince your &s;en&s;e of its importance. Permit me to congratulate you on the &s;ucce&s;s with which your efforts have been crowned. The libe|rality of your in&s;titution does honour to human nature. Like heaven, you receive men of all de|nominations, without regard to any thing but their goodne&s;s. May no &s;tandard ever be lifted here to call forth the &s;pirit of party, but may you live to|gether in peace, forbearing and forgiving one ano|ther. Let all things be done with decency, pru|dence and moderation. May you all enjoy the ble&s;&s;ings of &s;alvation, and while wor&s;hipping your common Parent, enjoy his &s;en&s;ible pre&s;ence, &s;o that with un&s;eigned fervour of &s;oul you may ex|claim,
<PB N="22" REF="030780_0021_0FE925A31C444848">
<Q>this is none other but the hou&s;e of God, and this is the gate of heaven.</Q> I now commend you to him who is able to keep you, and lead you into all truth. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace, and the God of peace &s;hall be with you.</P>
