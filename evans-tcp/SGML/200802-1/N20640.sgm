<P>IT was on a cold and &s;tormy December even|ing in the beginning of the fourteenth century, and not long after that fortunate period when Peter &s;urnamed the Cruel was cut off from a life which he had &s;tained with blood&s;hed, rapine, and oppre&s;&s;ion, that a &s;tranger entered a village &s;ituated on the banks of the Tagus, near the ea&s;tern extremity of the kingdom of Ca&s;tile, in Spain.

<P>NEXT morning the Pilgrim, after having be&s;towed on his ho&s;ts a hearty benediction, and his thanks for their ho&s;pitable &s;helter, took his leave, and proceeded on his way towards the ca&s;|tle of Duero. It was little le&s;s than a quarter of a league from the cottage to the avenue; and as he walked very &s;lowly, deeply immer&s;ed in thought, the day was advanced when he got to the gate of it. Here &s;eeing that the man&s;ion was at a di&s;tance little &s;hort of that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> he had already come, he &s;at him&s;elf down <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a large &s;tone bench, in order to re&s;t him&s;elf and di&s;cu&s;s at lei&s;ure the variety of &s;ubjects which occupied his thoughts, from the di&s;cour&s;e of the preceding night&mdash;He had not been long &s;eated, when he perceived a number of boys running towards him, with the &s;peed of a flock of frighted deer; one out&s;tripped the re&s;t, and, leaving them far behind, reached the &s;tranger before he had time to form a conjecture upon the novelty of his appearance. If the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> man was &s;urpri&s;ed at the &s;wiftne&s;s of his pace, he was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> at his per&s;onal appearance, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> at his addre&s;s. The full, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> of his limbs, and the large <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">

bones, di&s;played a &s;tature gigantic for his age, and promi&s;ed a proportionate &s;hare of &s;trength: his face, in which manly fire, dignity and &s;en&s;i|bility were blended, glowed with the colours of health and exerci&s;e; while an air at once maje&s;tic and in&s;inuating diffu&s;ed a charm over the whole, that operated like a &s;pell upon the beholder. Addre&s;&s;ing the old man with a mixture of re&s;pect, admiration, and pity, he &s;aid, I hope, Senor, you have not been long &s;itting in this place, &s;o unworthy your reverend appearance and years; &s;hould it be &s;o, I &s;hall have to accu&s;e my&s;elf of an unpardonable neglect, for which I &s;hould certainly receive a &s;evere reproof from Don I&s;idor. How far have you travelled this morn|ing? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> you breakfa&s;ted or taken any refre&s;h|ments? and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a moi&s;ture collecting in the old man's eyes, Do, dear Sir, get up, and I will lead you to a place where you &s;hall refre&s;h your|&s;elf with food and repo&s;e, and where you will meet with a hearty reception. Here he reached forth his hand to the Pilgrim, who gra&s;ping it in a mixed ec&s;tacy of tran&s;port and amazement, &s;natched it ha&s;tily to his lips, and bedewed it with tears of affection. O wondrous youth! exclaimed he, whom&s;oever thou art, whom God has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> on a model all his own, lead on&mdash;I will follow you any where&mdash;every where. He could no more&mdash;utterance was choked <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> tumult of his feelings, and he walked <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> along, his young guide holding him by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

his fingers, which he had caught in the exce&s;s of his rapture, and &s;till retained with a firm gra&s;p, while the other boys, who had come up one after the other, &s;urrounded them, gazing alternately at the beard, the dre&s;s, and the harp which hung at the back of the Pilgrim.</P>
<P>As they proceeded along&mdash;Is Don I&s;idor at home, my dear? interrogated the old man&mdash;No, Senor, he has been abroad for &s;ome days, but all the &s;ervants have directions to obey punctu|ally my orders in my father's ab&s;ence, and you &s;hall be well treated though he be not at home. To be &s;ure, he will be greatly delighted on his return, which is now hourly expected, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> you here; for nothing gives him &s;o much plea|&s;ure as the company of &s;trangers: at the farthe&s;t, he will certainly be back to-morrow: mean time, whenever my talk wearies you, Father Thomas will keep you in conver&s;ation more en|tertaining, as well as more &s;uitable to the gravity of your years.</P>
<P>At length they arrived at the gate of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. On its being opened, the &s;tranger was &s;urpri&s;ed to find him&s;elf &s;aluted with as much re&s;pect as if he had been a prince, by the keeper, who emphatically pronounced, Welcome, &s;tranger, whoever thou art, welcome to the ca&s;tle of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|ero!

Upon which the Pilgrim turning to his young friend &s;aid, Let me not, I be&s;eech you, young gentleman, detain you from your plea&s;ures. Though the days of youth are pa&s;t with me, I well remember the painfulne&s;s of re&s;traint; and I already feel too great an intere&s;t in your heart, to run the ha|zard of lo&s;ing any &s;hare of it by taxing your kindne&s;s too &s;everely.</P>
<P>Indeed, returned the youth, the delight I feel in attending you would more than compen&s;ate for the lo&s;s of any plea&s;ure. The &s;ervant who ju&s;t now &s;poke, came to call me to my riding-ma&s;ter: riding is a part of my daily exerci&s;e; but attending you is a duty much more material in it&s;elf, and much more productive of plea&s;ure to me.</P>
<P>Having brought his gue&s;t into the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, Al|phon&s;o led him into the great hall, placed him in the chair, and gave orders that immediate preparation &s;hould be made for his accommoda|tion and refre&s;hment; which Donna Ur&s;ula, the hou&s;e keeper, received with a heart burning with rage, and a face expre&s;&s;ive at once of mor|tification and contempt.</P>

<P>Begone! I &s;ay&mdash;and let me hear no more of it.</P>
<P>Thus &s;aying, Father Thomas proceeded to the great hall. Upon his entrance Alphon&s;o &s;prang acro&s;s it, took him by the hand, and led him over to the old man, who immediately ro&s;e, bent his aged knees, and be&s;ought his ble&s;&s;ing; which the holy man be&s;towed upon him, rai&s;ing him at the &s;ame time from the ground, and re|placing him in the great chair.</P>
<P>Father Thomas then took a chair, &s;eated him|&s;elf, and, having &s;urveyed the &s;tranger with an earne&s;t and &s;crutinizing eye, &s;ighed, and pre&s;&s;ed the hand of Alphon&s;o with a warmth expre&s;&s;ive of approbation; then addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the old man, Have you travelled far this morning, Senor? &s;aid he.</P>

Juanico was able, he would be as generous as the fir&s;t nobleman in Spain.</P>

The whole day he employed in &s;hewing him the gardens, woods, vineyards and ca&s;tle: the armoury particularly attracted the old man's attention&mdash;he looked with an eye of &s;kilful curio&s;ity at every part, each in its turn.

unde&s;cribable &s;en&s;ation thrilled to the old man's heart. He &s;eized Alphon&s;o in his arms, held him for &s;ome time cla&s;ped in his embrace, and wept.

<P>Next morning, while Alphon&s;o and his new friend were engaged in the armoury, the tramp|ling of hor&s;es announced the arrival of Don I&s;idor. Father Thomas met and retired with him into his clo&s;et: as &s;oon as permi&s;&s;ion was granted him, Alphon&s;o flew to embrace his fa|ther: when the mutual manife&s;tations of affec|tion were over, O father, &s;aid Alphon&s;o, I have got you a vi&s;itor in the hou&s;e.&mdash;So I have been told by Father Thomas, my dear; I entirely ap|prove of your behaviour to him, and thank you for &s;o very honourably repre&s;enting me in my ab&s;ence: I am the more plea&s;ed with your atten|tion to him, becau&s;e he is &s;o very poor a man.</P>

And turning to Don I&s;idor, I re&s;|pect him as much&mdash;almo&s;t as much as if it was your&s;elf:&mdash;then he has &s;uch a commanding air&mdash;and he talks &s;o grandly of war, and honour, and courage, and armour, that I am &s;ure he would delight you.</P>
<P>What Alphon&s;o &s;ays is not entirely void of foundation, &s;aid Father Thomas.</P>
<P>Well, then, &s;aid Don I&s;idor, tell your friend that I ki&s;s his hands, and &s;hall be glad to &s;ee him by and by in the great hall.</P>
<P>He is there now, &s;aid Alphon&s;o; I hear the &s;ound of his harp.</P>
<P>Then let us go to him, my dear.</P>
<P>On their entering into the hall, the old man ro&s;e, and, with a deportment maje&s;tic beyond expre&s;&s;ion, &s;aluted Don I&s;idor; who, on his part, received him, not with that arrogant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of humility which mortifies more than any other exertion of pride, but with that unfeigned con|de&s;cen&s;ion which made every benefit he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">|ferred valued le&s;s for the magnitude of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> than the cheerfulne&s;s of the giver. In truth, he felt in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e a veneration, if not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> impo&s;ed upon him by the figure before him.</P>
<P>I will not, &s;aid the old man, do &s;o much in|ju&s;tice to the character of Don I&s;idor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;uppo&s;e, that the footing on which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">

a per&s;on of my humble appearance in his ca&s;tle will &s;ubject Don Alphon&s;o to the imputation of ra&s;hne&s;s, or me to the cen&s;ure of forward intru|&s;ion. Don I&s;idor may be a&s;&s;ured, that the kind|ne&s;s of the youth (flattering though it was) &s;hould not have been accepted, had not univer|&s;al report per&s;uaded me that it would have been approved by his father.</P>
<P>Venerable Senor, returned Don I&s;idor, I hope you will find that your opinion, and the report which gave it birth, are not entirely mi&s;placed. My boy, who&s;e whole life has been one continued &s;eries of acts the mo&s;t grateful to my feelings, has never done one more productive of &s;atisfac|tion to me than procuring me the honour of your company. I am not, continued he, a man of much ceremony. And &s;hall therefore only tell you, that my gue&s;ts are, to all intents of ho&s;pi|tality, ma&s;ters of this ca&s;tle; and I beg that you will co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ider your&s;elf &s;o. Do me the favour to take your &s;eat, and I will again wait upon you, as &s;oon as I have given &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary orders.</P>
<P>When Don I&s;idor retired to his apartment, he could not help reflecting on the extraordinary appearance of the &s;tranger. Pilgrims and itine|rant bards he had often &s;een, but never one that at all re&s;embled this, in whom he imagined he could di&s;tingui&s;h the remains of the warring and the defaced ruins of the man of dignity. That he was of a rank far above his pre&s;ent
<PB N="19" REF="027101_0020_0FD33AFB17E1DC70">
&s;eeming, he had not the &s;malle&s;t doubt; but what that rank had been, or how he had fallen from it, he could not conceive, and he feared to enquire: even conjecture was lo&s;t in the wide field of calamitous events. While he was em|barra&s;&s;ed in this confu&s;ion of thoughts, Alphon&s;o entered. There is &s;omething, my child, &s;aid Don I&s;idor, in this old veteran's manners, which exacts more than common re&s;pect, and be&s;peaks him of &s;uperior rank, though fallen. I confe&s;s an invincible curio&s;ity to know who and what he is; but, as the recollection of &s;uch things mu&s;t be painful, I will rather content my&s;elf with ignorance of the matter than indulge my curio|&s;ity at the ri&s;k of giving a &s;ingle pang to his aged heart: I will therefore be &s;ilent on the &s;ubject, unle&s;s he choo&s;es of his own accord to di&s;clo&s;e him&s;elf to me. At all events, the great hall is a place where the difficulty he may have to be communicative mu&s;t be increa&s;ed by the frequent entrance of &s;ervants. I wi&s;h, my dear, to acquit my&s;elf to you of a vice which I have &s;o often and &s;o vehemently reprobated to you, and therefore declare, that not idle curio&s;ity, but an anxious de&s;ire to heal, if po&s;&s;ible, the wounds that fortune may have inflicted on him, induces me to this; I will therefore direct one of the &s;ervants to wait upon him with my re&s;pects, and inform him that I &s;hall be obliged to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> company in my clo&s;et.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="027101_0021_0FD33B0198D30E88">
Then, Sir, &s;aid Alphon&s;o, I had better go my&s;elf: will it not appear more re&s;pectful?</P>
<P>Thank you for your hint, my child, &s;aid Don I&s;idor: you &s;peak my very &s;oul.</P>
<P>Alphon&s;o was not long away, when he returned leading in the old man in the &s;ame manner as he had led him up the avenue. Don I&s;idor was &s;ur|pri&s;ed at perceiving that he had brought his harp with him. Being &s;eated at the de&s;ire of Don I&s;idor, he proceeded, without a word, to tune his harp, while his face exhibited marks of &s;trong emotions, and &s;eemed pregnant with extraordi|nary events. Don I&s;idor would not break in upon him. After a &s;hort prelude, he began to play, accompanying it with his voice. Melan|choly had &s;et her &s;tamp on every note he &s;ung.

<P>ALPHONSO Baron de Rayo, thou well re|membere&s;t, was of no mean di&s;tinction&mdash;his ca&s;tle was as &s;trong, his wealth as great, his va&s;&s;als as numerous, as any peer's in the king|dom of Ca&s;tile, and his renown in war, and favour with his prince, not le&s;s the topic of ad|miration with the nation at large than the &s;ubject of envy to his enemies:&mdash;his fortunes &s;eemed founded on a rock, and his honours and dome&s;|tic circum&s;tances to bid defiance to the &s;torms of adver&s;ity&mdash;&s;uch they were when la&s;t we parted.</P>
<P>Heaven had &s;pared me one daughter, the only remaining child of a numerous progeny; the re&s;t followed their beauteous mother to the grave, ere yet they reached the age of puberty. This and more thou already knowe&s;t; but as it makes a link in the great chain of events I propo&s;e to relate, I choo&s;e to be circum&s;tantial, even though it &s;hould render me tedious. In the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that daughter, and the re&s;ignation which, as a Chri&s;tian, I owed to the will of
<PB N="26" REF="027101_0027_0FD33B1107E45ED8">
Heaven, I buried the remembrance of all my lo&s;&s;es; and failing in male i&s;&s;ue, and being de|termined never to marry again, I adopted the &s;on of my &s;i&s;ter, the young Henry Gon&s;alvo, reared him as my own, and hoped, by my influ|ence with the king, to get the title and honours of the old hou&s;e of Rayo entailed upon him and his i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>At this time your father, the younger brother of a re&s;pectable branch of our hou&s;e, be&s;poke my patronage for you&mdash;I took you to my ca&s;tle, and, fancying that I &s;aw in you the dawnings of future greatne&s;s, determined to train you early up to arms.

<P>When our mo&s;t beloved monarch, the friend and patron of our hou&s;e, and the father of his people, died at the fatal &s;iege of the Moori&s;h fort Gibraltar, I retired in de&s;pondence and grief, and brought Gon&s;alvo with me; while you, arre&s;ted by a thir&s;t for glory, and di&s;daining a life of inactive dependance, remained behind. We returned&mdash;Henry loaded with honours, and I exulting in the reflection, that the reputation of our family, for ages celebrated in the field, and di&s;tingui&s;hed for valour and loyalty, was likely to &s;uffer no diminution in the hands of its new repre&s;entative.</P>
<P>We had not been long at home, when I had the additional &s;atisfaction to perceive a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> event ripening which from the fir&s;t I had anxiou&s;ly de&s;ired, and which alone was wanting to give full completion to all the wi&s;hes or views I had on this &s;ide the grave: in &s;hort, I perceived that a reciprocal affection was growing apace in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> bo&s;oms of Gon&s;alvo and my daughter; and being determined, neither on the one hand to injure their love by anticipated concurrence, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> to throw any ob&s;tacles in their way by too vigilant ob&s;ervation, I gave the young <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> ju&s;t as much time for uninterrupted

communication as I thought would &s;erve to &s;trengthen their flame, without con&s;uming their affection. Every thing turned out corre&s;pondent to my intentions. Henry, fearful of the event, retired to his father's hou&s;e, and from thence gave me, by letter, a di&s;clo&s;ure of his pa&s;&s;ion, with many expre&s;&s;ions of apprehen&s;ion; and above all, deprecating my &s;u&s;picions of perfidy and breach of ho&s;pitality in having paid his ad|dre&s;&s;es privately to my daughter. I &s;poke to Maria with all the delicacy I could; though I already knew, de&s;ired to be made the friendly confidant of her &s;entiments; and a&s;&s;ured her that my con&s;ent &s;hould not be wanting to make her happy. Over&s;pread wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">h blu&s;hes, and almo&s;t &s;inking with apprehen&s;ions and diffidence, &s;he mode&s;tly avowed her love. O I&s;idor! her ap|pearance, her manner, her every word and look at that in&s;tant recalled to my mind the dear de|cea&s;ed partner of my &s;oul, when blu&s;hing &s;he gave her&s;elf to my arms.&mdash;Here the Baron avert|ed his face, and covering his eyes with his hand, remained a few moments in &s;ilent agony. But recollecting him&s;elf, he exclaimed&mdash;This &s;hould not be&mdash;but &s;ad remembrance will obtrude it&s;elf.</P>
<P>A tear fell from Don I&s;idor, and the Baron re&s;umed his &s;tory.</P>
<P>At this period Peter called forth all his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, to cru&s;h a confederacy formed again&s;t him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ome di&s;contented nobles, at the head of which were his mother and his half brother. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

was the legitimate &s;on of our lamented king Al|phon&s;o; and I thought it my duty to defend him, without examining the merits of his cau&s;e. Gon&s;alvo and I accordingly &s;et out to join the royal &s;tandard. I will not enlarge upon the di&s;|gu&s;t the tyrant's whole conduct gave us: it however &s;erved to le&s;&s;en, if not entirely remove the regret I felt at finding you had long been a follower of the fortunes of Henry Count Tran&s;|tamare, his brother. You were right, as it has turned out; but I acted upon principles of loy|alty and allegiance, and find my con&s;olation in the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of intentional rectitude. To be &s;uccinct, we overcame the rebellion, and Gon&s;alvo and I returned to our peaceful ca&s;tle, with no other reward or compen&s;ation for our pains than the laurels we gathered in the field, which, under &s;uch banners as we fought beneath, were withered ere they could be plucked.</P>
<P>Immediately on our return, the nuptials of my children were celebrated with all the pomp and dignity becoming their illu&s;trious hou&s;e; and my happine&s;s &s;oon received further augmenta|tion by Henry's announcing to me the pregnancy of his wife. The wi&s;hed for yet dreaded moment at length arrived, and gave to our fond arms a noble boy: here my &s;oul &s;eemed to recline, and re&s;t it&s;elf as after a long fatiguing journey. The child was &s;carcely a minute from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ight&mdash;he was the delight of my &s;oul&mdash;I hung in raptures

over him, anticipating the opening of his man|hood, and drawing to my&s;elf, in fancy's flattering colours, the picture of his future form; the vi|gour and &s;ymmetry of tho&s;e limbs, then in a &s;tate of &s;hapele&s;s, helple&s;s inaction; the fire of that &s;pirit then repo&s;ed in torpid apathy; and the variou&s;ly expre&s;&s;ive beauties of that face, which then exhibited no trace of &s;en&s;ation, &s;ave the tran&s;itory impre&s;&s;ions of accidental pain, or the pa&s;&s;ing dimples of an unmeaning &s;mile.</P>
<P>A &s;hort time after this Peter again called us forth. His reiterated breaches of faith, his cru|elties and exactions, rai&s;ed up again&s;t him a formidable power, headed by Henry Count Tran&s;tamare, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the renowned Bertrand Gue&s;clin. I thought it our duty to attend him, nor could we, however willing at &s;uch a time to remain at home, decline the &s;ummons without tarni&s;hing, or at lea&s;t hazarding our fame. We therefore prepared to depart; and the young child, which was named after me, Alphon&s;o, was put out to nur&s;e in a village near the ca&s;tle, my daughter being determined to attend her hu&s;band to Cordova. From this re&s;olution, how|ever extraordinary, nothing could di&s;&s;uade her; and every thing being done that could render the journey convenient to her, we &s;et out, and, without any incident worthy of relation, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> at Cordova, which to our a&s;toni&s;hment we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> inve&s;ted by Peter; his enormities having <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

the inhabitants to the de&s;perate mea&s;ure of de|claring openly again&s;t him. We were, however, treated with every mark of di&s;tinction by the gentry round the place; and the &s;ingular heroi&s;m and conjugal affection of Maria rai&s;ed her &s;o high in every one's e&s;teem, and gained her &s;uch uni|ver&s;al re&s;pect, that her condition was rendered much more tolerable than we could po&s;&s;ibly have hoped for.</P>
<P>Among tho&s;e who were mo&s;t forward in doing honour to our family, was the Marquis de Puna|lada, a man of an illu&s;trious hou&s;e, and high in favour with the king: he had formerly been acquainted with Gon&s;alvo, and now renewed his intimacy with a zeal that gave us the more plea|&s;ure, as the capricious and violent temper of the king made the condition of all tho&s;e who were not favourites, either immediately or collaterally, extremely precarious and di&s;agreeable. We had little time for the cultivation of this intimacy. Henry was ordered off on a &s;ervice of con&s;idera|ble danger and difficulty; and I was ordered, together with all the elder Barons, to remain with the army at the &s;iege, in order that the king might avail him&s;elf of our coun&s;els&mdash;while Maria retired with the Counte&s;s Dalmado to the city of Eceja, to wait the return of her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not interrupt the thread of my &s;tory with a detail of the operations of the army, which perhaps you already know as well as I: but tell you, that here I was informed that you

had peri&s;hed with the other adherents of Count Tran&s;tamare, with whom the tyrant broke <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aith &s;o wickedly at Toledo. Something, no doubt the &s;tings of a guilty con&s;cience, fretted Peter, and inwardly preyed upon him: naturally ill-di&s;|po&s;ed, he grew daily wor&s;e, and the noble loyalty of &s;ubjects never was put to &s;o &s;evere a trial as in adhering to the cau&s;e of that weak, worthle&s;s tyrant.</P>
<P>For a con&s;iderable time I had heard nothing from Gon&s;alvo or my daughter; I began to feel an unea&s;ine&s;s unu&s;ual to me, at a neglect for which I was utterly unable to account, when one day I was put under arre&s;t, and hurried before the king.</P>
<P>Uncon&s;cious of having committed any offence to merit &s;uch a gro&s;s indignity, I was bu&s;ied in forming conjectures on the &s;trange event; when going through the camp to the king's pavilion, I heard a herald pronouncing my &s;on, Henrico Gon&s;alvo, a traitor. More at a lo&s;s than before, I di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the enquiry into the cau&s;es from my mind, and only looked to the con&s;equences, which I determined to endure with that un&s;haken fortitude and dignity that became a noble Ca&s;|tilian.</P>
<P>Arrived at the royal pavilion, I found Peter &s;eated on his throne, a number of the nobility around him, and, as u&s;ual, the Marquis de Puna|lada at his right hand, in conference with him, while his face appeared convul&s;ed with a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

of all the horrid pa&s;&s;ions that &s;hake human na|ture, &s;truggling for the ma&s;tery of his &s;oul. Perceiving me, he turned abruptly from the Marquis de Punalada, and, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to me, &s;ternly &s;aid&mdash;When foul rebellion &s;tains the branches of a family, and well-founded &s;u&s;picion falls upon the chief &s;tock, what reparation does ju&s;tice to an injured monarch demand&mdash;what mea&s;ures do his &s;ecurity require?

<P>When trea&s;on or di&s;loyalty is proved again&s;t the hou&s;e of Rayo, my liege lord, returned I, my&s;elf will be the fir&s;t to pronounce the &s;entence of the &s;evere&s;t rigour, and call the execution of it ju&s;tice.</P>

<P>None, an&s;wered I, but the di&s;loyal and trea|cherous ever found an enemy in, or had cau&s;e to fear danger from, our hou&s;e&mdash;and who but your maje&s;ty dares accu&s;e us of it?

<P>Do&s;t thou then, di&s;&s;embler as thou art, inter|rupted the king, pretend ignorance? Why fled thy rebel &s;on, and joined the cau&s;e of Tran&s;ta|mare?

<P>At the time that this war broke out, and the king called upon his people to ri&s;e in arms, my years might have exempted me, without impu|tation, from the &s;ervices of war.

Did I then come forth at the&s;e years to tarni&s;h all the glories of a well-&s;pent life, act the ba&s;e di&s;&s;embler's part, and play the hoary fool? I a&s;k you, my lords, is it po&s;&s;ible?

<P>Here the king broke off my di&s;cour&s;e; and, ri&s;ing furiou&s;ly, ordered me into confinement. I was hurried out of the pavilion, and the next day was conducted under a &s;trong guard, and lodged a clo&s;e and &s;olitary pri&s;oner in a cell in the tower of Siguenca.</P>
<P>For a long time I was utterly incapable of re|flection, or of entering into an inve&s;tigation of this unaccountable turn in our affairs: all within was wild chaos, confu&s;ion, and uproar.

<P>O my Maria! O my Henry! would I exclaim, where are you, my comforts? Do you &s;till live, or has the ruffian hand of barbarous power a&s;&s;ailed your precious lives? O gracious Lord of all, if it be &s;o, give the guilty to the ven|geance

<P>Thus, day after day and month after month elap&s;ed: having no diver&s;ity of incidents to chequer exi&s;tence, I had no objects by which to mea&s;ure time, and was uncertain what number of years I pa&s;&s;ed in that dreary man&s;ion. Lo&s;ing all hope of revi&s;iting the world, I almo&s;t lo&s;t all de&s;ire too, and had laid my account with ending my days in that di&s;mal pri&s;on; when one night I was vi&s;ited by a dream or vi&s;ion, and to this hour I cannot determine which. Methought, as I lay in my bed, Gon&s;alvo called to me. I looked up, and beheld him pale, emaciated, with every appearance of wildne&s;s and di&s;traction in his face and air; I looked at him and wept; then &s;tretched forth my hands to embrace him: he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">uded my endeavour.

<P>Next morning the impre&s;&s;ion of this phanta&s;m was &s;o &s;trong upon my &s;en&s;es, that I was almo&s;t at a lo&s;s to determine whether it was a reality or a dream: while I was in a train of contem|plation on it, the keeper of the pri&s;on entered my chamber&mdash;I a&s;ked him whether any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words">

<P>The coincidence of the dream with this my deliverance made an impre&s;&s;ion on me difficult to conceive, impo&s;&s;ible to be de&s;cribed, I thought I &s;aw the finger of Providence pointing out the way to &s;ome &s;trange and momentous revelation. The tumult of my feelings, &s;urpri&s;e, joy, a&s;to|ni&s;hment, and &s;u&s;pen&s;e, was more than my en|feebled &s;tate could &s;upport.

So recommending my&s;elf to the Almighty, and be&s;eeching him to endue me with &s;trength and patience, I again turned my back on Andalu&s;ia.

My way was long; and as I walked &s;lowly, and was ob|liged to re&s;t frequently, it was a con&s;iderable time before I got to the banks of the Ebro. The night before I reached them, I was vi&s;ited by a dream nearly re&s;embling that which I had in the pri&s;on of Siguenca: Gon&s;alvo came in as before, and repeated the words, Sire, &s;eek my lo&s;t child!

<P>I traver&s;ed the banks of the Ebro for many leagues, enquiring in vain for the Marquis de Punalada, till I came near that part which once owned me for its lord; a place I &s;hould above all others have avoided, were it not for the hopes of &s;eeing my grandchild, or at lea&s;t hearing of him&mdash;an indulgence which I deferred only for the purpo&s;e of being fir&s;t &s;atisfied about his father and mother. As I approached, there|fore, I felt all the torments of &s;u&s;pen&s;e and ap|prehen&s;ion. At length, however, I arrived within a &s;hort way of the ca&s;tle. It was evening when I knocked at the door of the fir&s;t pea&s;ant's cottage within the boundaries of the lord&s;hip of Montalto. A &s;tranger appeared, who rudely demanded my bu&s;ine&s;s. I told him I de&s;ired to &s;ee Juan, the man of the hou&s;e. If you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Juan Navarro, returned he, you mu&s;t look for him &s;omewhere el&s;e.

it was once his, but thank God and my ma&s;ter, it is now mine. And pray who is your ma&s;ter? The Marquis de Punalada. The Marquis de Punalada! Yes, the Marquis de Punalada. The Baron de Rayo, its former owner, has been put to death for high trea&s;on, and the king gave that ca&s;tle yonder, and this e&s;tate, to my ma&s;ter: it is not above three days &s;ince he left it, and went to his other e&s;tate in Andalu&s;ia. O Heavens! what were my feelings!&mdash;How I &s;upported them I know not. The circum&s;tance that Punalada, the &s;pecious friend of Gon&s;alvo, rather than any other per&s;on, &s;hould have got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our confi&s;cated property, &s;truck like <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ightning a thought acro&s;s my mind, a &s;u&s;picion of an act too full of horror, guilt, and wickedne&s;s, for man to perpetrate, and in the fulne&s;s of my heart I exclaimed, O cur&s;ed, cur&s;ed villain!&mdash;The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">el|low, full of re&s;entment at my abu&s;e (as I &s;uppo&s;e he thought of him&s;elf), lifted his arm to &s;trike me&mdash;I &s;mote him to the ground, and retired.

to which a languor &s;ucceeded that in all pro|bability tended to &s;ave me from the more acute effects of my pa&s;&s;ion. The good people of the cottage, much affected with my emotions, u&s;ed every little art to con&s;ole me, execrating the wretches who could aim a blow at a head &s;o white as mine. Urged by their repeated &s;olici|tations, I at length took &s;ome food and went to bed: here, &s;leep, which u&s;ually flies from the touch of the unhappy, led on by fatigue, vi&s;ited me.

The &s;econd night I took up my lodging among the charitable fathers of a Franci&s;can mona&s;tery.

Don Alvarez, I had frequent opportunities of conver&s;ing with Donna I&s;abella, and found that her mind was as highly gifted with wit, and en|riched with knowledge, as her per&s;on was with beauty.&mdash;Not to trouble you with a detail of minute circum&s;tances, intere&s;ting only to the parties concerned; we conceived a reciprocal tenderne&s;s for each other, and I obtained her con&s;ent to demand her in marriage from her father, and to that end to a&s;k the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Don Alvarez; but as her father was of a very high rank and proud di&s;po&s;ition, and I at the time but a &s;oldier of fortune, it was determined that I &s;hould wait until my &s;ervices entitled me to rank, which in the &s;cene we were then going to, was likely &s;oon to happen. We privately plighted our faith to each other, and parted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> mutual a&s;&s;urances of eternal and inviolable fidelity. Soon after we took the field: what happened there, and afterwards at Gibraltar up to the time of your departure, I need not men|tion; the king, you know, honoured me with knighthood, and on your returning home I re&s;olved to remain with the army returning back to Ca&s;tile; actuated perhaps by a thir&s;t for glory, but certainly by my pa&s;&s;ion for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> I&s;abella too.

you to, demanded a communication of &s;o very important an affair; but the truth is, I was doubtful of &s;ucce&s;s, and too proud to circulate the &s;hame (as I then thought it) of a di&s;appoint|ment if I &s;hould fail: let it &s;atisfy you, that I did not communicate it even to Gon&s;alvo.&mdash;But to return whence I have digre&s;&s;ed&punc; I thought my newly acquired honours gave me more rea|&s;onable preten&s;ions, and made this a fit &s;ea&s;on to introduce the &s;ubject of my pa&s;&s;ion to Alvarez, not doubting, from the &s;trong friend&s;hip he expre&s;&s;ed for me, and which I thought was &s;incere, that he would willingly render me all the &s;ervice he could on the occa&s;ion. Whatever his private feelings on my opening the bu&s;ine&s;s to him might have been, he affected to take my propo&s;al in good part, but told me that to the King and Queen Dowager Maria I mu&s;t make my &s;uit, as they had honoured the young lady with their patronage, and had taken to them|&s;elves the ta&s;k of providing for her a &s;uitable alliance.</P>
<P>The duplicity of Alvarez mu&s;t have been ob|vious to any one, who was not blinded by exce&s;s of pa&s;&s;ion on one hand, and the &s;ecurity of &s;in|cere friend&s;hip on the other.

clo&s;e my inclinations to him, which I did the &s;ucceeding day in the mode&s;te&s;t manner I could, concluding with an account of our reciprocal attachment, and of our engagement to each other, which we had entered into previous to my taking the field.</P>
<P>I was much &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee the king knit his brows, and di&s;cover manife&s;t marks of di&s;plea|&s;ure during the latter part of my &s;peech.&mdash;When I had done, Don I&s;idor de Haro, &s;aid he, we have been plea&s;ed with thy &s;ervices to our royal father, and have given thee proofs of our approbation&mdash;but think no more of this lady as you value our favour&mdash;we have already provided her with a &s;uitable match&mdash;our royal word i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> pledged, and cannot be departed from.

<P>With all the di&s;&s;imulation of a true courtier, Don Alvarez affected to condole with me on my misfortune; and I left him, nothing relieved by his di&s;cour&s;e, though full of gratitude for his friendly &s;ympathy.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. The Goatherd's Story.</HEAD>
<P>I AM now old, and have all my life followed the bu&s;ine&s;s of a goatherd, and of cour&s;e mu&s;t have &s;een va&s;t numbers of beautiful places; but never have I &s;een any place to equal in beauty this very &s;pot of Valle&s;anto; and this, Senor, all men will tell you, was its reputation time out of mind; and the richne&s;s of its pa&s;tures, the coolne&s;s of its air, the plenty of its provi&s;ions, the content of its inhabitants, the &s;anctity of its convent, and the virtues of the family who were lords of it, made it the topic of conver&s;ation in all neighbouring parts. The pre&s;ent lord of all the country you &s;ee round is the Marquis de Punalada, almo&s;t as old as my&s;elf: he came to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the e&s;tate and ca&s;tle at an early age, and, was beloved by all who knew him&punc; his fame was not confined to this valley, for there were few in Spain who did not hear of and acknowledge his greatne&s;s. He married a lady his equal in rank, reputation, and fortune; but in charity, piety, and all the virtues that di&s;tingui&s;h Chri&s;tians, &s;uperior to all the men and women of her day. They lived long to|gether in the greate&s;t happine&s;s, and had two children, a &s;on and a daughter; and all the poor

rejoiced in the pro&s;pect of finding one day, in the virtues of the children, a continuation of the advantages they had already derived from the charity of their forefathers. Soon after the birth of tho&s;e children, the Marquis was called on by the king to attend him to the wars&mdash;&s;o he went, leaving his lady and family behind him, and from that time Valle&s;anto began to decay. Captivated by the king's favour, he grew proud, and forgot his good lady and children at home.

However, at la&s;t he removed them here; and the cau&s;e that was a&s;&s;igned for it was &s;o extraordinary, that it I had not had it from one of his own dome&s;tics I &s;hould not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> believed it.

&mdash;it was with a picture! It was &s;aid to be the picture of &s;ome man dead God knows how long. However, this did not &s;atisfy the young lady, but &s;he mu&s;t go to a Hadador,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A fortune-teller.</NOTE> who told her, that whenever &s;he &s;hould &s;ee a man who re&s;embled that picture, the hou&s;e of Puna|lada would tumble to the ground. Some of her attendants informed the Marquis of this predic|tion; in con&s;equence of which he hurried her off here, and &s;hut her up in a chamber of the ca&s;tle, where &s;he was watched with the utmo&s;t vigilance: no one had acce&s;s to her but the Marquis, the Father Prior of the convent, her brother, and &s;ome old dome&s;tics; for, having in his fury ordered the picture to be burnt, he had nothing to give the &s;ervants as a guide; where|as, had he kept the picture, he might have com|pared all comers with it, and &s;o perhaps kept off danger. As misfortunes &s;eldom come alone, the Marquis perceived a new turn in the ca&s;tle, which threatened not only &s;orrow but &s;hame: in &s;hort, he found that my young lord, his &s;on, had fallen violently in love with his &s;i&s;ter, and was abandoned enough to make odious propo|&s;als to her. The unhappy young lady, to &s;hel|ter her&s;elf, told the Marquis, who directly put her into the convent; while he him&s;elf, racked with &s;ome inward affliction, &s;hut him&s;elf from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> intercour&s;e but with the Padre Prior.

was &s;aid to be haunted; a chapel, in which ma&s;s was &s;ometimes celebrated, was &s;hut up and let to run to ruin: in &s;hort, Senor, nothing but misfor|tune, affliction, and bad luck, has for many years attended the family and the place; and the neighbouring goatherds have for&s;aken the val|ley upon account of frightful appearances that haunt it.</P>
<P>Do you mind that, Senor? interrupted Pier|rot&mdash;Why, good man, as his wor&s;hip and I were la&s;t night&mdash;Alphon&s;o darted an angry look at him, and he was &s;ilent.</P>

<P>Alphon&s;o was received with every mark of tenderne&s;s by the king, who informed him, that the author of the anonymous letter was too wary to fall into the trap projected for him&mdash;but that he was fully convinced Don Rodrigo and his mother were at the bottom of it. In little more than a week after he had di&s;patched the letters to his father and the Baron, he had the happi|ne&s;s of &s;eeing them at Burgos. The latter was impatient to hear the promi&s;ed &s;tory, and clo|&s;eted him&s;elf for above an hour with Alphon&s;o, who&punc; gave him an accurate account of every particular, not forgetting the goatherd's account of the Marquis de Punalada.</P>
<P>The Baron, after examining and que&s;tioning him over and over on the &s;ame particulars, at length was &s;ilent; and, after ruminating for &s;ome time, de&s;ired Don I&s;idor to be called in. To him he made Alphon&s;o again relate the won|ders of Valle&s;anto. Don I&s;idor was a&s;toni&s;hed. It is, &s;aid the Baron vehemently, it is the blood of Gon&s;alvo crying from the ground!&mdash;I own it is extraordinary, &s;aid Don I&s;idor, who turning to Alphon&s;o, &s;ifted him with all his art; and confe&s;&s;ed he &s;carcely knew what to &s;ay to it, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to it! exclaimed the Baron, we will act to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> nor &s;hall my &s;oul find one moment's re&s;t, till the horrid &s;ecret is revealed.

He is the very man I wi&s;h, returned the Baron. Alphon&s;o was a&s;toni&s;hed&mdash;He &s;aw in the Baron a new man: youthful vigour re-animat|ed every feature; enlivened every motion, and gave to his limbs a force, and to his whole air a formidable energy, that age never exhibits. Don I&s;idor was delighted&mdash;he once again &s;aw that Baron Rayo that u&s;ed at once to impre&s;s him with love and awe; and his &s;oul again con|fe&s;&s;ed the plea&s;ing nece&s;&s;ity of obedience. All &s;hall be done, Baron, &s;aid he: need I &s;ay that my hand, heart, and life, are devoted to the accompli&s;hment of your de&s;ire? Yes, yes, &s;aid the Baron, &s;triding acro&s;s the room; the &s;tains, the &s;orrows, the di&s;graces, the murders, that have brought the hou&s;e of Rayo to the ground, though they cannot be repaired, &s;hall be re|venged&mdash;mo&s;t horribly revenged&mdash;and this arm &s;hall be the in&s;trument!</P>
<P>But, dear Baron, interrupted Don I&s;idor, re|pre&s;s this ri&s;ing choler&mdash;overcome tho&s;e emo|tions, which indulged may perhaps be the means of fru&s;trating your views.</P>

<P>Don I&s;idor was &s;ilent&mdash;Alphon&s;o felt an un|u&s;ual trepidation.&mdash;The Baron &s;eemed to tread in air.</P>
<P>Pierrot was again &s;ent back to Duero, with a letter to Father Thomas, who in eight days more returned, together with Juanico, to Bur|gos.

<P>ON the fifth day they arrived at the entrance of the valley, ju&s;t as the &s;un was half-way dip|ped behind the we&s;tern hill on which Alphon&s;o and his &s;ervant had before breakfa&s;ted with the goatherds.

They came to a little rill of water clear as the pure&s;t cry&s;tal, which ran towards the river&mdash;in &s;ome places forming the mo&s;t en|chanting pools, deep, pellucid, and &s;heltered by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">anging willows&mdash;and in others babbling over <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">bbles with a &s;weet and lulling murmur.

Into this, after having di&s;mounted, they entered, and led their hor&s;es.

<P>As &s;oon as they had dined, they departed for the ca&s;tle: as they approached it they &s;aw, or thought they &s;aw, the country become more gloomy; and their imagination, influenced by their opinion of the Marquis, viewed it as a place out off from the goods of Providence, where gra&s;s grew not, and where the affrighted earth drew back into her womb her natural produce, as fearful to tru&s;t it to the hands of &s;uch a mon&s;ter. They rode along the walls, and perceived that they were &s;trongly in|trenched behind a deep ditch, over which as they advanced they found a draw bridge drawn up: pa&s;&s;ing further on, they ob&s;erved that the wall turned to the &s;outhward, and continuing their route along it &s;aw that it joined that of the priory. They turned back again, and as they approached the draw-bridge ob&s;erved three men walking on the wall: on their nearer ap|proach, Don I&s;idor courteou&s;ly &s;aluting them inquired to whom that noble ca&s;tle belonged.

<P>AS &s;oon as they arrived at the city of Burgos, the Baron, Don I&s;idor, Father Thomas, and their attendants, remained at an inn, while Alphon&s;o went to court. He fir&s;t made it his bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;ee his patron, Don Juan de Padilla, and be|&s;ought him to obtain for him a private audience of the king, to whom, he &s;aid, he &s;hould, in his pre&s;ence, unfold a bu&s;ine&s;s no le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ing than horrible. The king, not le&s;s inclined to oblige his mini&s;ter than to &s;erve his favourite, in&s;tantly granted him the audience, in pre&s;ence of Don Juan. Alphon&s;o began by entreating his maje&s;ty to believe, that nothing le&s;s than a bu&s;i|ne&s;s of the mo&s;t &s;erious moment could induce him to call upon his maje&s;ty's attention in &s;o very &s;e|rious and urgent a manner.&mdash;He plighted him|&s;elf to prove, to the conviction of the world, one of the mo&s;t execrable con&s;piracies that ever was conceived by man in his mo&s;t abandoned wicked|ne&s;s&mdash;a con&s;piracy formed again&s;t the honour, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> fortunes, and the lives of a hou&s;e di&s;tingui&s;h|ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the &s;ervice of the crown of Ca&s;tile&mdash;carried <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> effect&mdash;concealed for many years, and at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> di&s;covered by means more than ordina|ry
<PB N="174" REF="027101_0175_0FD33C4BA3CB6808">
&mdash;by the intervention of the avenging hand of Heaven. He &s;aid, that the affair was &s;o intri|cate, &s;o dependent on a variety of proofs, and &s;o very difficult of explanation, that it would be nece&s;&s;ary, as well for his maje&s;ty's ea&s;e as for the more perfect elucidation of it, to have the prin|cipal per&s;onages of it before his maje&s;ty: and he earne&s;tly entreated to have the liberty of bringing them on the morrow in attendance before him: one of them was Don I&s;idor, his father; another, the Reverend Father Thomas Augu&s;tino; the third, Baron de Rayo.&mdash;How! &s;aid Don Juan, Baron de Rayo! Has he not been dead, his e&s;tates confi&s;cated, and his titles extinct? That the Ba|ron's e&s;tates were confi&s;cated, and his blood at|tainted by Peter, &s;aid Alphon&s;o, is too true; but it is equally true that he lives, and that the at|tainder was taken off by our late king Henry. The con&s;piracy and con&s;equent frauds and murder that led to that&mdash;How&mdash;murder! exclaimed the king. Even &s;o, my liege&mdash;mo&s;t foul murder, perhaps wor&s;e, returned Alphon&s;o: I &s;ay, and I undertake at the hazard of my life, and, what I value more, your maje&s;ty's favour, to prove that the hou&s;e of Rayo has &s;unk beneath the hands of a villain and a murderer!</P>
<P>This is &s;trong language! &s;aid the king.</P>
<P>It is, my liege, &s;aid Don Juan, and &s;uch as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> pre&s;ume Alphon&s;o, ere he uttered it, was pre|pared to make good.</P>
<P>Then what is the &s;cope of your pre&s;ent com|mand? &s;aid the king.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="027101_0176_0FD33C4D0FE98C20">
That the per&s;ons I have named be permitted, on the morrow, to come before your maje&s;ty, in pre&s;ence of Don Juan, and &s;uch other per&s;ons as your maje&s;ty may think fit, there to lay before you the whole of this tran&s;action.</P>
<P>I grant it, &s;aid the king.</P>
<P>May your faithful &s;ervant, &s;aid Alphon&s;o, pre|&s;ume to &s;ugge&s;t the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ecre&s;y for the pre&s;ent; Don Rodrigo is nearly concerned in the event, though not in the guilt.</P>
<P>Enough, &s;aid the king&mdash;To-morrow morning at ten o'clock, I will, for greater caution, be at Don Juan's hou&s;e; there we will hear of this ex|traordinary affair.</P>
<P>On the morning, Alphon&s;o, attended by Don I&s;idor, the Baron, and Father Thomas, repaired to Don Juan's, who received them all with every mark of e&s;teem, and particularly treated the Ba|ron with di&s;tingui&s;hed re&s;pect: they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> upon the bu&s;ine&s;s in hand, and Don Juan a&s;&s;ur|ed them of the king's re&s;olution to render ju&s;tice to the Baron.</P>
<P>At the appointed time the king came, and with him the corregidor of Burgos. The king de&s;ired Alphon&s;o to proceed. Alphon&s;o entreat|ed that the Baron de Rayo might be permitted to explain the nature of the ca&s;e. The Baron began from the very commencement, and after deprecating the imputation of egoti&s;m, if he &s;poke of him&s;elf, which the nature of the ca&s;e demanded, gave a detail of the &s;ervices of him|&s;elf and his family to the &s;tate; relating vari|ous

victories which had been acknowledged by the reigning kings to have been gained over the enemies of the faith and &s;tate, by his valour and wi&s;dom: for a proof of all which he referred to exi&s;ting records, and living evidence. He then de&s;cribed the heroi&s;m and achievements of his &s;on; and drew a picture of the &s;ufferings of him and his daughter, which affected the king ex|tremely: he then adverted to his own mi&s;eries&mdash;his impri&s;onment&mdash;wanderings&mdash;wants&mdash;and finally his reception by Don I&s;idor.</P>
<P>Here Alphon&s;o took up the affair, with an ac|count of the incidents at Valle&s;anto.</P>
<P>Don I&s;idor then began with the &s;tory of the &s;earch&mdash;and la&s;tly, Father Thomas produced the ring, &s;abre, crucifix, and dagger, and the papers found in the portmanteau, &s;ealed up; all of which they jointly and &s;everally &s;wore to.</P>
<P>Don Juan was a&s;toni&s;hed.&mdash;He &s;aid, that the leading circum&s;tances of the tale tallied exactly with facts in his recollection. He was intimate with Gon&s;alvo&mdash;knew his device&mdash;believed it was his ring&mdash;would certainly know his armour, as they had often fought together&mdash;and he parti|cularly recollected, that the Marquis de Punalada &s;uddenly retired from court &s;oon after the di&s;|appearance of Gon&s;alvo.</P>

<P>My lord, &s;aid the Baron, his maje&s;ty and you will ob&s;erve, that in this &s;trange di&s;covery, evi|dently made under the directing hand of Heaven, pre&s;umptive evidence is the utmo&s;t we can yet reach; the identity of the per&s;on murdered will be admitted &s;ufficiently proved, when the ring, the armour, and the letters directed to Gon&s;alvo, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> with the &s;keleton, the &s;kull of which is &s;plit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and the in&s;trument lying in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> are taken into con&s;ideration.

to induce your maje&s;ty to &s;et on foot an in|quiry; to call the Father Prior of the convent to account for that croud of &s;u&s;picious circum|&s;tances, and thence to draw more ample proof of the guilt of the accu&s;ed?</P>
<P>This, &s;aid the king, is certainly rea&s;onable.</P>
<P>The corregidor agreed with his maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>Your maje&s;ty then &s;ees, continued the Baron, that the next con&s;ideration will be, how to do this in &s;uch a manner as to prevent the cunning of tho&s;e concerned from rendering the enquiry abor|tive: and as I have turned the whole through my mind, and have con&s;idered it with &s;o much the more attention, as I am mo&s;t concerned in the i&s;|&s;ue, I will, with your maje&s;ty's permi&s;&s;ion, &s;ugge&s;t a plan which I tru&s;t will meet with approbation.</P>
<P>The corregidor de&s;ired him to explain him&s;elf.</P>
<P>My &s;cheme, &s;aid the Baron, is this:&mdash;In the fir&s;t place, let &s;ome of your lord&s;hip's mo&s;t intel|ligent officers, duly authori&s;ed, proceed with us to the vaults, and there take full cognizance, and te&s;tify to your lord&s;hip in writing what &s;hall ap|pear to them: let this, along with the te&s;timony of the reverend Father here, of Don I&s;idor, and of Don Alphon&s;o, be made up into a record, and depo&s;ited, together with the ring, armour, &s;abre, and letters, in the archieves of your court; on this your maje&s;ty will ground an order for the arre&s;t of all parties &s;u&s;pected; and in the exer|tion of this, care mu&s;t be taken to prevent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> impediments, by collu&s;ion or otherwi&s;e, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> thrown in the way of ju&s;tice. To this end, while

one armed force &s;urrounds the ca&s;tle of Punalada on one &s;ide, and another the priory on the other, we, with a cho&s;en few of your maje&s;ty's appoint|ment, will enter the vault by the private pa&s;&s;age and be ready to receive any one that might en|ter it through the ca&s;tle. I have many rea&s;ons for expecting, from the execution of this plan, much &s;ucce&s;s, &s;eeing that the &s;udden concu&s;&s;ion of unexpected fear, has often &s;haken from the &s;oul of a hardened &s;inner, a guilty &s;ecret, which the deliberate operations of ju&s;tice, nay, torture it&s;elf, could not wring from him.</P>
<P>The corregidor then declared, that notwith|&s;tanding the miraculous tenor of the whole tran&s;|action, every thing which had fallen from the Baron carried &s;o much the &s;terling weight of truth, as, joined with the evidence, and his and the other witne&s;&s;es known integrity, &s;erved to bear down all doubt of his &s;incerity; and he en|tirely approved of his plan for facilitating a full di&s;covery, and en&s;uring ju&s;tice: and in conclu&s;ion added, that he would appoint a proper per&s;on to go and hold the inque&s;t de&s;ired.</P>
<P>The king, on his part, a&s;&s;ured the Baron, that on the proof of what he had advanced being e&s;|tabli&s;hed (of which by the by he had little doubt), every practicable reparation &s;hould be made to him and his family: for, &s;aid he, exclu&s;ive of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> demand ju&s;tice makes on me as a &s;overeign, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> think &s;omething e&s;pecially due to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of Alphon&s;o.</P>

and ki&s;&s;ed the king's hand.&mdash;Long may John live the pride and glory of Ca&s;tile! exclaimed the Baron: the re&s;t pronounced a heart-felt amen: and the king and corregidor retired.</P>
<P>Don Juan kept them all that day at his hou&s;e, and in the evening an officer arrived with a let|ter from the corregidor to the Baron; he had orders to proceed directly on the inque&s;t: they re&s;olved to &s;et out that night; but it was agreed that the &s;ervants &s;hould remain behind, to pre|vent unnece&s;&s;ary &s;peculations.</P>

<P>IT was ju&s;t twilight when they arrived in the valley: they proceeded to the bower, where, ac|cording to a prior determination, the Baron and Don I&s;idor remained with the hor&s;es, while Fa|ther Thomas, the officer, and Alphon&s;o, went to the chapel. Arrived at the month of the &s;ub|terraneous pa&s;&s;age, they &s;truck a light, and found the place ju&s;t as it had been left by them. The ob&s;tructions being now few, they got down with|out much lo&s;s of time: Alphon&s;o &s;oon found the little door that opened into the vault.&mdash;The of|ficer entered cro&s;&s;ing him&s;elf, and was &s;mote with horror at the &s;pectacle pre&s;ented to his view. He examined the &s;kull&mdash;the armour&mdash;every thing&mdash;and took down an accurate account of the whole in writing. In order to e&s;tabli&s;h the point of the relative &s;ituation with the convent, Father Tho|mas opened the cemetery, and &s;hewed him the bodies of the decea&s;ed fathers of the convent, which he likewi&s;e exactly noted, and then again returned into the vault.

<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> entered now into a long vaulted gallery, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> off tran&s;ver&s;ely on either &s;ide the door: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> they &s;topped to deliberate which way

they &s;hould turn, whether to the right branch or the left. While they were in this &s;tate of &s;u&s;|pen&s;e, their ears were &s;truck with the notes of &s;oft mu&s;ic, which &s;eemed to come from the ex|treme end of the right branch of the vaulted gal|lery.

<P>They again as cautiou&s;ly as po&s;&s;ible &s;tept for|ward, and at the end of the gallery &s;ound that it again branched off to the left.&mdash;At this in&s;tant they heard another &s;igh, and pre&s;ently a voice, tuned by the hand of harmony it&s;elf, exclaimed: Oh ble&s;&s;ed and mo&s;t merciful redeemer! when &s;hall my &s;oul take its flight, and &s;helter it&s;elf in thy bo&s;om from the mi&s;eries of this life?&mdash;They took advantage of the &s;peaking to &s;tep <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ward without giving alarm, and perceived before them a glimmering light faintly break acro&s;s the gal|lery.

<P>THIS ca&s;tle was once a nunnery, and is coeval with the convent of Valle&s;anto; this will account for the number of &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;ages which unite them: in an inva&s;ion of the Moors they took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, and di&s;per&s;ed the nuns, after having violated their cha&s;tity.

<P>IT was pretty far advanced in the night of the fourth day before they came near the city: Al|phon&s;o and Fernando, taken up with reflection and mutual congratulations on their happine&s;s, dropped behind, and had fallen into conver&s;a|tion on the beauty of the night and the bright|ne&s;s of the moon, when, ju&s;t as the carriage turned the corner at the extreme end of an oli|vary, and got out of hearing, a band of armed ruffians ru&s;hed from the covert of the trees upon the two youths, who had no per&s;on to aid them in re&s;i&s;tance but Pierrot. Before they were pre|pared to defend them&s;elves, one of the ruffians from behind buried a dagger in the &s;houlder of Alphon&s;o, and felled him to the earth. Fernando on the in&s;tant &s;aw the &s;troke given, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the ruffian to the ground; he then vigorou&s;ly at|tacked the re&s;t, and Pierrot coming up to his aid beat them off all but three who lay weltering under the wounds given them by Fernando Pierrot then pur&s;ued and &s;topped the couch, relating at the &s;ame time what had pa&s;&s;ed&mdash;Don Alphon&s;o, &s;aid he, is killed, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> all at once put an end to our&s;elves.

<PB N="208" REF="027101_0209_0FD33C985EFB84C0">
and found Fernando weeping over the bo|dy of Alphon&s;o:&mdash;Alas, my brother, my bro|ther, my friend! but one in&s;tant &s;ooner and I &s;hould have &s;aved you&mdash;Oh! would to Heaven the dagger had met my heart in&s;tead of yours: but, unhappy that I am, I &s;aw the blow but time enough to revenge, and I &s;ave my own worth|le&s;s life, while thine is lo&s;t.

Ju&s;t at this in&s;tant, a patrole of the Ronda<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A patrole or watch in Spain.</NOTE> came up mounted. The Baron hailed them&mdash;Here hath been murder committed, &s;aid he; have you got a light?&mdash;Yes, &s;aid the officer, and di&s;playing a dark lan|tern di&s;mounted and examined tho&s;e on the ground.

<P>Alphon&s;o was laid on a bed at the inn with little &s;ymptom of life&mdash;a &s;urgeon &s;oon attended, and declared that it was impo&s;&s;ible he could re|cover. Donna Maria was di&s;tracted, and, im|pelled by an unaccountable feeling which over|came form, hung upon him and ki&s;&s;ed his clay|cold lips. She was at la&s;t drawn away to give room to the &s;urgeon, who, examining narrowly, began to be of opinion that the wound had not reached any vital part, and ob&s;erved that he mu&s;t have been hurt el&s;ewhere: he therefore exa|mined him carefully, particularly about the head, and found a con&s;iderable &s;welling ju&s;t above the ear&mdash;Here, &s;aid he, is the chief injury; can you tell how he received it, or from what &s;ort of wea|pon? He got but one &s;troke, replied Fernando, and that was in the &s;houlder. Then the hurt in the head has proceeded from his weight in fal|ling, and the lo&s;s of blood from the &s;houlder is in that ca&s;e rather u&s;eful than injurious. While they were thus &s;peaking, Alphon&s;o began to breathe hard, then groaned: the &s;urgeon order|ed a gla&s;s of water, with which he wetted his lips, letting a little down&mdash;Still the word was death.</P>
<P>Meantime the officers of the Rondo had got the

wounded a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins to the inn. One appeared, from his equipments, to be a gentleman of con&s;i|derable rank, but he was in as hopele&s;s a &s;tate as Alphon&s;o: another was in the livery of a &s;er|vant; and a third had the appearance of a bravo. The two la&s;t were coming to them&s;elves, but the fir&s;t &s;eemed quite &s;en&s;ele&s;s though he breathed; they were all de&s;perately wounded, particularly the gentleman, who&s;e arm was cloven at the joint of the &s;houlder almo&s;t from his body.</P>
<P>As the accident happened at the di&s;tance of le&s;s than a league from the city of Burgos, Don I&s;idor, on his arrival at the inn, wrote off to Don Juan, informing him of the affair, and intreating proper a&s;&s;i&s;tance to be &s;ent out.

<P>When the two inferior a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins came to them|&s;elves, Don Juan, the Baron, and Don I&s;idor, were informed of it, and coming to the room where they were, Don Juan was immediately de&s;cried by him who wore the livery.

Don Juan looking at the fellow perceived that he was a bravo, and ordered the two to be immediately carried under a &s;trong guard to jail.</P>
<P>The next day Alphon&s;o was much recovered, but complained of a violent pain from the wound in his &s;houlder: he was however declared by the &s;urgeon to be able to proceed &s;lowly in the car|riage

to Burgos. The gentleman a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, Don Rodrigo too, was able to proceed on a litter; a &s;trong guard was ordered for him, and he was depo&s;ited in the jail, and a &s;urgeon ordered to attend him: his mother was almo&s;t mad with vexation and di&s;appointment&mdash;but all her inte|re&s;t, all her tears, all her fal&s;ehoods, and all her addre&s;s were of no avail; &s;he could get no one hardy enough to apply to the king in his favour.</P>
<P>During Alphon&s;o's illne&s;s Donna Maria never quitted him, but when delicacy required.</P>
<P>But, a con&s;iderable time having elap&s;ed, and the wound continuing in the &s;ame &s;tate, the &s;ur|geon expre&s;&s;ed his &s;urpri&s;e at the &s;lowne&s;s of the, proce&s;s, and frequently animadverted on &s;ymp|toms of a feveri&s;h kind, for which he could not account.

<P>Next day he put the que&s;tion of his love with &s;ome delicacy to Alphon&s;o; who candidly ac|knowledged, that a lady he had met with on his travels in Portugal had gained entire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his affections&mdash;and though he &s;carcely hoped ever to &s;ee her again, he could not help cheri&s;hing the love with which, &s;he in&s;pired him, and in|dulging &s;ome &s;mall hopes.&mdash;He then told his fa|ther the whole &s;tory, and concluded with &s;hew|ing him the picture.

She adds, that &s;he has a &s;e|cret of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to unfold&mdash;briefly to this effect:&mdash;She was the nur&s;e of Don Henrico Gon&s;alvo's &s;on&mdash;was &s;educed by a prie&s;t (whom I &s;uppo&s;e to be the Prior) to give up the child to the Marquis; that at la&s;t being prevailed upon, &s;he travelled with it towards Andalu&s;ia, and fall|ing by accident into a cottage where a child of Don I&s;idor de Haro (whom &s;he knew to be the
<PB N="224" REF="027101_0225_0FD33C954E91E778">
cou&s;in of Gon&s;alvo) was at nur&s;e, &s;he determined to &s;ave the child, whom &s;he loved, from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the Marquis, which &s;he thought might po&s;&s;ibly be wicked; and accordingly left Don Gon|&s;alvo's in the bed, and carried away Don I&s;idor's. So that by this account, the youth Fernando, it is probable, is Don I&s;idor's, and the other your grand&mdash;child. The woman is in cu&s;tody, &s;o take your mea&s;ures accordingly.</P>

<P>P. S. The woman is dying, and has made oath to this effect.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Here, &s;aid the Baron, giving the letter to Don I&s;idor, all is cleared up&mdash;Fernando is yours, Al|phon&s;o is mine.</P>
<P>Alphon&s;o &s;hall &s;till be mine, replied Don I&s;idor, for he &s;hall be married to my daughter&mdash;I wrote to my &s;i&s;ter, who arrived at Duero ca&s;tle <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he day after we left it, from Portugal, whence &s;he was obliged to fly to e&s;cape the importunities and power of an old nobleman who had fallen in love with my daughter. She wrote me an account of he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> re&s;cue by a young Spaniard, long &s;ince, from Seville. I have now received her an&s;wer to my letter; and am happy to find that the im|pre&s;&s;ion Alphon&s;o made upon her niece keeps pace with his love for her. When Pierrot fir&s;t hinted the affair, I &s;u&s;pected the fact ju&s;t as it turned out. Come, Baron, &s;aid Don I&s;idor, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> us give a loo&s;e to joy&mdash;each of us has gained without
<PB N="225" REF="027101_0226_0FD33CA97B95EBE8">
without the other being a lo&s;er&mdash;and the&s;e events, which at fir&s;t appeared &s;o adver&s;e, will &s;erve to unite our families by additional bonds of affec|tion.</P>
<P>The body of Gon&s;alvo was buried in great pomp at Montalto; and, &s;oon after, Alphon&s;o received Don I&s;idor's daughter to his arms&mdash;was inve&s;ted with half the e&s;tates of the Marquis by the King; the other half, with Punalada ca&s;tle, being by his de&s;ire &s;ettled on Fernando, who inherited al&s;o his grandfather Guzman's e&s;tate. Don Rodrigo was &s;ent to the mines&mdash;his mother was condemned to bani&s;hment&mdash;while the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the convent of Valle&s;anto was doomed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">|petual impri&s;onment in the Inqui&s;ition. Father Thomas received the priory as a gift from the hands of the Archbi&s;hop of Seville. La&s;tly, the Baron lived not only to &s;ee Alphon&s;o and Fer|nando the fir&s;t warriors in Spain, and created barons, but even to in&s;truct a great&mdash;grand&s;on in the rudiments of the &s;cience of warfare; and at la&s;t died, at an amazing age, &s;urrounded by a numerous race of heroes, the de&s;cend <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the old and illu&s;trious HOUSE OF RAYO.</P>
