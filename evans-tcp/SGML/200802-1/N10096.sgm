<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PART I.</HEAD>
<P>THE artificial communication of the &s;mall-pox, an operation more generally known at pre&s;ent under the name of inoculation, has been practi&s;ed time imme|morial, in Circa&s;&s;ia, Georgia, and the countries bordering upon the Ca&s;pian &s;ea. Tho' unknown in the greate&s;t part of Europe, it was in u&s;e in the principality of Wales in England. It was formerly known, and &s;ince neglected in Greece and Turky, and was not revived again at Con|&s;tantinople till towards the end of the la&s;t century, when a The&s;&s;alian woman practi&s;ed it there with great &s;ucce&s;s; but this was only among the lower cla&s;s of people. This cu&s;tom is very ancient, and generally received in the i&s;land of Cephalonia, &s;ubject to the republic of Venice; it is com|mon in the Morea, and the i&s;land of Candia. If we go out of Europe, we &s;hall find it at Bengal, and &s;o long practi&s;ed on the coa&s;t, and in the interior of Africa, at Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli, that its origin is unknown, but proba|bly introduced in the time of the Arabs. In the begin|ning of the la&s;t century, the &s;mall-pox was communicated at China, without inci&s;ion, but through the no&s;e, by re|&s;piring the matter of &s;ome dried pu&s;tules reduced to pow|der. All the&s;e facts were buried in oblivion, till Emanuel Timone, a Greek phy&s;ician, and member of the univer&s;i|ties of Padua and Oxford, having undertaken to bring inoculation into &s;ome vague, gave an ample di&s;cription of it in a letter to Dr. Woodward, written from Con&s;tantino|ple in the month of December, 1713. During the eight years he had attended the operation in that capital, there were only two fatal events, who&s;e cau&s;es were foreign to inoculation, one of the patients having died of a dy&s;entery the 32d day, and the other of a mara&s;mus, the 40th after the operation.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="012825_0004_0F8B41B02A79F660">James Pilarini, another Greek phy&s;ician, who had long di&s;approved the new method, at la&s;t, fully convinced of its utility from the evidence of facts, wrote an apology for the artificial &s;mall-pox, in a &s;mall Latin work, printed at Venice in 1715. The The&s;&s;alian woman a&s;&s;ures us &s;he had inoculated 6000 per&s;ons in the year 1713. Of this number were the greater part of the Engli&s;h, Dutch, and French merchants &s;ettled at Con&s;tantinople. Anthony Le Duc, another Greek, who we al&s;o inoculated by this woman, received afterwards, in 1722, the Doctor's cap, at Leyden, maintained publicly the practice if inoculation.</P>
<P>Madam Wortley Montague, the Engli&s;h Amba&s;&s;ador's Lady at the Ottoman Porte, in 1717, had her only &s;on, about &s;ix years old, inoculated there by her &s;urgeon, and afterwards her daughter, on her return to England, where the example was followed by &s;everal per&s;ons of di&s;tinction. It was by the de&s;ire of the College of Phy&s;icians, at Lon|don, that the experiment was made on &s;ix criminals; it &s;aved a life they de&s;erved to lo&s;e by their crimes. The late Queen of England then Prince&s;s of Wales, had two of her younger daughters, the late Queen of Denmark, and the Prince&s;s of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el, inoculated in 1722: This operation, conducted under the Direction of Dr. Sloane, contributed greatly to inhance the reputation of this new pre&s;ervative. Whil&s;t the mo&s;t famous phy&s;icians of Great-Britain, the Doctors Sloane, Fuller, Arbuthnot, Jurin, Mead, &amp;c. favoured the new method, or wrote in its favour; whil&s;t Dr. Shadwell, &amp;c. practi&s;ed it on their children, Blackmore and Wag&s;taffe, two phy&s;icians little known, and Ma&s;&s;ey, an apothecary, &s;eemed to endeavour to get a name by pro&s;cribing it. Whil&s;t the Bi&s;hop of Sali&s;bury and other ca&s;ui&s;ts &s;uffered their children to be inoculated, other divines pretended that it brought down the wrath of Heaven on the nation: To prove this, &s;ome were &s;o ab&s;urd as to aledge the great numbers that died of the na|tural &s;mall-pox, and one, in particular, boldly a&s;&s;erted in his &s;ermon, that the devil him&s;elf had given Job the &s;mall-pox, by this infernal method.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="012825_0005_0F8B41B0A5440DE8">However, be&s;ides the experiments of Con&s;tantinople, where, in one year, upwards of 10,000 per&s;ons had happi|ly pa&s;&s;ed through this trial, a great number were inoculated in England without any accident. Dr. Jurin, Secretary to the Royal Society, publi&s;hed &s;everal pieces in 1723, and 1724, whereof &s;ome are in&s;erted in the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions, giving an account of the &s;ucce&s;sful experi|ments made in Great-Britain and New-England, with &s;eve|ral letters by way of &s;upplement and proofs, and exact li&s;ts of the &s;ick, and tho&s;e that died of the natural and artificial &s;mall pox; together with compari&s;ons of their effects. It appears from his calculat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">&punc; confirmed by others more recent, that at London, and even in the country, where the di&s;temper is reputed le&s;s dangerous, there died commonly a &s;eventh, &s;ixth, and &s;ometimes fifth of tho&s;e, who had been taken ill of the natural &s;mall pox, whil&s;t &s;carce one died in ninety-one, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;uch as received it by in&s;ertion, though it could not be proved that this death was occa&s;i|oned thereby, and though <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> yet brought to perfection. In the&s;e beginni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> experiments were hazarded upon infirm and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;ubjects; and it was in &s;uch circum&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters"> that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> New-Eng|land, of 300 per&s;ons, young, old, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, inocu|lated indi&s;criminately, from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eventy, with few precautions, in a time of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> hot whether, five died&punc; that is, one in &s;ixty; though it is doubtful whether they died of the effects of the operation; however it is pre|tended that one died in forty-nine, and this misfortune, having fallen upon &s;ome per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, gave weight to the clamours of &s;uch as &s;hewed them&s;elves prejudiced. The Magi&s;tracy interpo&s;ed, the &s;pirit of party interfered, and the operation was not permitted but under certain re|&s;trictions that re&s;embled a prohibitation. It was given out that inoculation did not p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;erve from the natural &s;mall-pox, and yet no example could be produced, to prove it. The wi&s;er and more moderate concluded, that it was pru|dent to wait till time and repeated experiments had given more in&s;ight into the matter.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="012825_0006_0F8B41B1615274E0">The &s;ucce&s;s of the new method was fir&s;t known in France, by a letter M. de la Co&s;te, a Doctor to phy&s;ic, addre&s;&s;ed to M. Dodard, the King's fir&s;t phy&s;ician, and publi&s;hed at Paris in 1723, with the approbation of M. Burette, a Doctor of the faculty of Paris. In this letter, followed by &s;ome others of M. Sloane, M. Amyand, &amp;c. the advantages of inoculation are properly &s;tated, the li&s;ts and calculations of M. Jurin are cited, and &s;ome new facts are advanced, with judicious arguments, and an&s;wers to objec|tions. Mention is al&s;o made therein of a con&s;ultation of nine of the mo&s;t famous Doctors of Sorbonne, whom the author had the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee conclude at la&s;t, `that it was licit, in the view of being &s;erviceable to the public to make experiments of that practice.' The &s;ame letter &s;up|po&s;es, that M. Dodard, and &s;everal other famous phy&s;ici|ans, as the late M. Chirac, M. Helvetius, &amp;c. approved the new method. In the &s;ame work is quoted a letter of M. A&s;truc, wherein he expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf, `that he did not judge that the operation could be attended with any dan|ger, and that he was glad it was intended to be prac|ti&s;ed at Paris.</P>
<P>The fal&s;e reports that were indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;pread of the ill &s;ucce&s;s of inoculation, at Bo&s;ton, during the &s;ummer of 1723; the number carried off by the epidemy that &s;ame year at London, and fal&s;ely attributed to the operation; &s;ome mi&s;fortunes cau&s;ed by the imprudence of young per|&s;ons newly inoculated, who committed exce&s;&s;es; had di|mini&s;hed the public confidence. The&s;e reports reached Paris when the phy&s;icians had re&s;olved upon making their experiments. After the &s;ucce&s;s of tho&s;e in England, and particularly on the Royal family, it was high time for making e&s;&s;ays in France, at lea&s;t in the ho&s;pitals. They were favoured by the Duke of Orleans, Regent of France; but his eyes were &s;carce clo&s;ed, when a the&s;is was main|tained in the &s;chools of medicine, which, &s;ounding the alarm again&s;t the inoculators, treated their operation as criminal, tho&s;e that practi&s;ed as impo&s;tors and execution|ers, and the patients as dupes.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="012825_0007_0F8B41B224EAA348">Repeated blows b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing immediately after given to the new method, it &s;oon fell into a &s;ort of oblivion till the year 1738. In that interval few were inoculated, even in Eng|land, and &s;ince that time the hi&s;tory of that this practice became almo&s;t unknown in France.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t it &s;eemed to lo&s;e ground in Europe, it made new conque&s;ts in A&s;ia. The epidemy of 1723, the plague of Europe and America, made perhaps the tour of the world. The Tartars, among whom the &s;mall-pox is not common, were infected, and the greater part of grown-up per&s;ons died of it. Father Dentrecolles, a Jesuit Mi&s;&s;iona|ry, in his very curious letter of the 11th of May, 1726, at Pekin, relates that, in 1724, the Emperor of China &s;ent phy&s;icians from his palace into Tartary, to &s;ow there the artifical &s;mall-pox; this is the name the Chine&s;e give their method of in&s;ertion, of which we &s;hall &s;peak in its place. Undoubtedly the &s;ucce&s;s of the Chine&s;e phy&s;icians was fortunate, having brought back with them a great num|ber of hor&s;es, &s;kins, and furs, which are the riches and money of the Tartars.</P>
<P>In other parts, the practice of inoculation, after the Eu|ropean manner, was perfected in &s;ilence during the time of its di&s;grace: Its progre&s;s was le&s;s divulged, but its &s;a|lutary effects were not therefore le&s;s con&s;picuous, both in the antient and new world. Much about the year 1728, a Carmelite Mi&s;&s;ionary, in the neighbourhood of the Por|tugue&s;e colony of Grand Para, in South-America, &s;eeing all the Indians of his mi&s;&s;ion dying one after another of an epidemical &s;mall-pox, and that not one infected per&s;on recovered, he &s;aved all tho&s;e that remained, by hazarding on them, the method of inoculation, of which he had but a very &s;uperficial knowledge, from an European gazette. His example was followed not le&s;s &s;ucce&s;sfully by one of his brethren, a Mi&s;&s;ionary on the banks of Rio Negro, and by &s;ome Portugue&s;e of Para. In a new epidemy that laid wa&s;te that province in 1750, the &s;ame pre&s;ervative produced the &s;ame effect. A terrible epidemy ravaged
<PB N="8" REF="012825_0008_0F8B41B3029A1B70">
Carolina in 1738; all tho&s;e who were taken ill could not re&s;i&s;t the violence of the di&s;temper. Then it was that they called to mind how efficacious the remedy was, which they had neglected &s;ince the year 1724; they had again recour&s;e to inoculation, which &s;ucceded better than ever, becau&s;e, in the hot &s;ultry months of June, July, and Augu&s;t, a &s;ea|&s;on very contrary to inflammatory di&s;ea&s;es, and in a coun|try where the method had not &s;ucceded &s;o well as in Eu|rope, of a thou&s;and per&s;ons inoculated, but eight died, which is only one to 125. It is very probable that in the experiments made in America, on a multitude of negro|&s;laves, le&s;s precautions were u&s;ed in preparing the &s;ubjects, than in the operations made in Europe on free-men, who&s;e lives were more precious: Be&s;ides, the generality of the negroes are originally infected with a veneral virus, which they bring from their country, and therefore the choice of fit &s;ubjects for inoculation is thereby rendered more difficult.</P>
<P>The new &s;ucce&s;s of the practice in Carolina, in 1738, was not equal to that of the &s;ame year in England, when it began again to take place. Of near 2000 inoculated within twelve years at Winche&s;ter, and the neighbouring parts of Hamp&s;hire and Su&s;&s;ex, none died, according to the account of Dr. Langri&s;h, but two women with child, who were di&s;&s;uaded by their phy&s;icians to expo&s;e them|&s;elves to inoculation.</P>
<P>The year 1746 was, at London, the epocha of the foun|dation of a hou&s;e of charity, as well for inoculating the poor, and dimini&s;hing by this means the deva&s;tation, made by the &s;mall-pox, of mankind, as for &s;uccouring tho&s;e who might be taken ill of it in the natural way. It was in the church of this ho&s;pital, and in the &s;ame pulpit where, 30 years before, inoculation had been treated as the work of devils, that Dr. Maddox, Bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter, preached that famous &s;ermon, &s;everal times reprinted, whereby he excites the charity of his fellow-citizens in favour of this practice, of which he demon&s;trates the advantages: The
<PB N="9" REF="012825_0009_0F8B41B3AAAC54E8">
annexed notes to this &s;ermon, and the work publi&s;hed by M. Kirkpatrick, inform us that of 309 per&s;ons the great|er part adults, inoculated in the new ho&s;pital, and of 1500 inoculated by three different Practitioners, that is, of 1809, but &s;ix died, which does not make one in 300; that M. Winche&s;ter, Surgeon to the Foundling ho&s;pital, lo&s;t but one child in 186; and that, of 370 other experiments made el&s;e where, one only had proved unfortunate. M. Frevin a&s;&s;ures us, that, of upwards of 300 inoculations at Rye, but one was un&s;ucce&s;sful. It is true, that at Sali&s;bury four died out of 422, and three at Blandford out of 309.</P>
<P>In the month of November, 1747, M. Ranby, fir&s;t Sur|geon to his Britannic Maje&s;ty, had inoculated 827, and his experiments, all fortunate, amounted at the end of 1752, to upwards of 1000. The difference of &s;ucce&s;s may be partly attributed to the greater or le&s;s degree of malignity in the epidemy, partly to the greater or le&s;s &s;hare of precaution in preparing and tending the &s;ick, and, la&s;tly, to the dif|ferent degrees of experience and abilities of the inoculators, but e&s;pecially to the maxim of not hazarding inoculation on per&s;ons of a bad con&s;titution, unwhol&s;ome, or &s;u&s;pected of other di&s;orders. The Greek woman at Con&s;tantinople was exceeding &s;crupulous in all the&s;e points, and it was to her exact ob&s;ervance of them, that &s;he attributed the con|&s;tancy of her &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>In re&s;uming the foregoing facts, and &s;everal others of which I omit the detail, I find, that, in the whole, out of 316 inoculated, but one died.</P>
<P>In 1748, one Dr. Tronchin, a native of Geneva, and In&s;pector of the College of Phy&s;icians of Am&s;terdam, having been on the point of lo&s;ing one of his &s;ons by the natural &s;mall-pox, re&s;olved to inoculate his elde&s;t: This was the fir&s;t inoculation in Holland. It was followed by nine others, which M. Tronchin took upon him the di|rection of. Two years after, he recommended this practice at Geneva, which being accordingly adopted, M. Calen|drini, a famous Mathematician, and one of the chief Ma|gi&s;trates of the republic, &s;et the example on his &s;on, no
<PB N="10" REF="012825_0010_0F8B41B46340A880">
fatal event has &s;ince occa&s;ioned there any regret. The &s;ame year, inoculation was introduced in Italy, by Dr. Peverini, then phy&s;ician of Citerna, in the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical State, with very happy and &s;ingular circum&s;tances. He was imitated by &s;everal of his confraternity, and upwards of 400 per&s;ons, of all ages, were &s;ucce&s;sfully inoculated in tho&s;e parts.</P>
<P>In 1753, inoculation began again at Am&s;terdam with the epidemy, and the mo&s;t illu&s;trious families at the Hague were the fir&s;t to follow the example of M. Tron|chin. The &s;uffrage of M. Swenke, Profe&s;&s;or of Anatomy, and a phy&s;ician of great reputation in his profe&s;&s;ion, and the continuity of &s;ucce&s;s, brought the method into reque&s;t in &s;everal towns of Holland. Switzerland, as well as Eng|land, is indebted for it to the example of a tender mother, a lady of Lauzane, who, &s;eeing that her &s;on did not catch the &s;mall-pox from his two &s;i&s;ters, gave it to him by the way of in&s;ertion.</P>
<P>Such have been for upwards of 30 years vici&s;&s;itudes of fortune in the famous method of inoculation. The eme|tic and bark did not meet with le&s;s contradictions, till their virtues were generally known. But, before we pro|ceed, it will not be ami&s;s to give a di&s;tinct idea of inocula|tion, as being an e&s;&s;ential part of its hi&s;tory, and of the different manner of practi&s;ing it, by tho&s;e who know it but imperfectly.</P>
<P>The artificial &s;mall pox is probably more ancient at China than el&s;ewhere. Father Dentrecolles, ob&s;erves in his letter above-mentioned, that if this cu&s;tom was introduced from Circa&s;&s;ia, or the adjacent parts, into China, it would, in all probability, have fir&s;t extended into the we&s;tern provinces, and the neare&s;t to the Ca&s;|pian &s;ea; whereas it is in the other extremity of that emplie, towards the Ea&s;t, and in the province of Kiangnan, on the &s;ea of Japan, that the method of Tchong-teou, that is, of &s;owing the &s;mall-pox, is more antiently known. The Chine&s;e thru&s;t into the no&s;e of children a tent of cotton
<PB N="11" REF="012825_0011_0F8B41B5403E7C18">
impregnated with the matter of the dried pu&s;tules of the &s;mall-pox reduced into powder. This trial was made in England, in 1721, on a young woman under &s;entence of death: She was more &s;ick than any inoculated in the u&s;ual way, and the Chine&s;e practice, of which father Dentrecol|les relates three different receipts, was judged dangerous.</P>
<P>Both in Greece and Turky, the liquid matter, &s;till hot, drawn, &s;ome moment before, from pu&s;tules of a natural and fovourable &s;mall pox, was introduced in &s;even or eight punctures made in different parts of the body, with &s;everal &s;uper&s;titious precautions accompanied with offer|ings of wax candles, by the means of which Timone &s;u&s;pec|ted that the Greek inoculatre&s;s procured the good-will of the Grecian prie&s;ts, who &s;upplied her with a prodigious multitude of &s;ubjects for inoculation.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Timone de&s;cribes the different operations of two Grecian old women: The one of Philippopolis, &s;ome|what more &s;imple in her proce&s;s; the other of The&s;&s;alo|nica, who joined quackery to &s;uper&s;tition, but who, more &s;kilful than any of her &s;i&s;terhood, had remarked, as the Chine&s;e, that it was indifferent to u&s;e for inoculation mat|ter taken from a natural or artificial &s;mall-pox. LaMotraye relates the manner of his &s;eeing the operation conducted in Circa&s;&s;ia, by an old woman, much after the way at Con|&s;tantinople. She only made punctures on different parts of the body with three pins tied together; the patient was brought as, is &s;till practi&s;ed in Barbary, to one &s;ick of the natural &s;mall-pox. This cu&s;tom is dangerous, the inocu|lated party being thereby expo&s;ed to receive the di&s;temper by contagion, before the in&s;ertion produces its effect; but this conformity of practice between the Circa&s;&s;ians and the people of Barbary might be an inducement to pre&s;ume, that, among the great number of Circa&s;&s;ian &s;laves, who compo&s;e the militia of Cairo, by the name of Mamelus, &s;ome of them had brought the cu&s;tom from their country into Egypt, from whence it might have been propagated at Tripoli, Tunis, Algeries, and in the interior of Africa.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="012825_0012_0F8B41B5DCB0B230">In the principality of Wales, le&s;s formality was u&s;ed. School-boys gave one another the &s;mall-pox by pricking them&s;elves with a needle, or by only rubbing the arm or the hand till the blood appeared, with pu&s;tules of the &s;mall-pox that began to dry; he that was to get it, gave two or three pence to him from whom he borrowed the matter, and this cu&s;tom had no other name among the Welch, than of buying the &s;mall-pox. Long experience has giv|en in England the preference to the following method, which has been long practi&s;ed by M. Ranby, and &s;ince at|tended at Geneva with the greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;s, both on children and adults to the age of thirty.</P>
<P>After preparing the &s;ubject during &s;ome days by a regi|men and proper remedies, &s;uch as a moderate diet, one or two gentle purges, a bleeding, if the ca&s;e requires it, and &s;ometimes bathing; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Doct. Dim&s;dale, undoubtedly one of the mo&s;t ingenious inocu|lators, in Europe, prefers the following method of infecting his pa|tients. The per&s;on to be inoculated, being in the &s;ame room, with one who has the di&s;ea&s;e, a little pus is taken from a ripe pu&s;tule, on the point of a lancet. With this lancet an inci&s;ion is made in that part of the arm where u&s;ually i&s;&s;ues are placed, deep enough to pa&s;s the &s;carf &s;kin about the eighth of an inch in length. The wound being opened between the thumb and fingers of the operator, the mat|ter on the point of the lancet is wip'd on the wound. Neither plai&s;ter, bandage, or covering is applied. The Doctor ob&s;erves, that this method had never once fail'd him. At the time of Dim&s;dale's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the abo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e he had inoculated 15<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">0 patients without a &s;ingle <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.</NOTE> an inci&s;ion, not exceeding an inch in length, and &s;o as &s;carce to cut through the &s;kin, is made in the external and middle part of both arms, beneath the tendon of the mu&s;cle deltoides, that the liberty of motion might not be under any re&s;traint; in the inci&s;ion is in&s;erted a thead of the &s;ame length, impregnated with the matter of a ripe pu&s;tule, and without redne&s;s at its ba&s;e, of a pock, either natural or artificial, taken from a whol&s;ome child.

once a day. However, this long delay may, in a great mea&s;ure, be deemed an exce&s;s of precaution; five or &s;ix hours were thought &s;ufficient by the Greek inoculators, who, after pricking in four or five places were only careful to mix well the blood and variolous matter with their needle, and to cover the punctures with a walnut-&s;hell.</P>
<P>Though the fir&s;t days after the operation the patient is in a condition of going out, yet he is made to keep his chamber and to continue the regimen. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Since De la Condamine wrote, great improvements have been made by Inoculators in Europe and America. The pre&s;ent and mo&s;t approved method of treating both the natural, and artificial &s;mall-pox, is that the patient goes abroad in all weathers, from the time of inoculation, 'till the termination of the di&s;ea&s;e; that a free u&s;e of cold water as common drink be indulged. Cold air, which phy&s;icians &s;uppos'd would endanger the lives of tho&s;e expos'd to it, while under the influence of the &s;mall-pox, has been found, Fir&s;t by accident, and &s;ince, by repeated, judicious experiments, to prevent, frequently, the &s;econdary fever, and always to le&s;&s;en it. See Dim&s;|dale on inoculation.</NOTE> He is put to bed the 6th or 7th day, when the fever begins, which is &s;eldom accompanied by bad &s;ymptoms, as they u&s;ually cea&s;e by the eruption on the 7th or 8th day: Then the inflamma|tion of the wounds dimini&s;hes; they yeild more matter, and the greater part of the venom flows out by that way. The 10th day after the eruption they begin to fill, the 15th to be cicatri&s;ed, and the 20th they u&s;ually clo&s;e of them|&s;elves; if they are preceived &s;till to flow, they &s;hould not be clo&s;ed too ha&s;tily. One inci&s;ion has been found &s;uffici|ent; and, if two are made, it is not only to be more cer|tain that the in&s;ertion has taken well, but al&s;o to facilitate, by a double canal, the i&s;&s;ue of the variolous matter, and in order thereby to render that which forms the pu&s;tules le&s;s abundant, le&s;s acrimonious, le&s;s corro&s;ive, and the na|ture of the &s;mall-pox more benign. Theory agrees won|derfully in this point with experience.</P>
<P>Sometimes all, or almo&s;t all, the venom flows out thro' the two inci&s;ions, and the patient has but one or two pu&s;tules, &s;ometimes even not one; he is not therefore le&s;s
<PB N="14" REF="012825_0014_0F8B41B9AA316C10">
&s;ecure from contracting the &s;mall-pox, when inoculated anew. The more the matter comes out abundantly from the wounds of the arms, the more the number of pu&s;tules are few and di&s;tinct; whereas each parcel of the matter of the internal heat forms a particular pu&s;tule in the na|tural &s;mall-pox, which often makes it confluent, and therefore much more dangerous. Among the inoculati|ons at Geneva, that kind was &s;carce ob&s;erved; and not one retained the lea&s;t mark. This was al&s;o ob&s;erved not only in England, but in Greece and Circa&s;&s;ia, whereof the inhabitants adopted the cu&s;tom with the view only of pre|&s;erving the beauty of their daughters.</P>
<P>What occa&s;ions the greate&s;t danger in the natural &s;mall-pox, is the &s;econdary fever that happens when the &s;epera|tion begins; but in the artificial &s;mall-pox, that fever is very rare, e&s;pecially in children, who &s;carce &s;icken. Among 20 per&s;ons inoculated at Geneva, by M. Guyot, one only, a woman, and the mother of &s;everal Children had that &s;e|cond fever.</P>
<P>This method of inoculating by inci&s;ion, adopted now upwards of 30 years, by all the Engli&s;h &s;urgeons, and commonly practi&s;ed at Geneva, was brought from Con|&s;tantinople to England, by M. Maitland, &s;urgeon to Lady Wortley Montague. Maitland received it from Timone, who had &s;ub&s;tituted it to the punctures of the Greek inoculators. In the fir&s;t e&s;&s;ays made in Italy, the lancet was &s;ometimes u&s;ed, and &s;ometimes only the prick of a pin, in imitation of the &s;implicity of the Greek operation, e&s;pecially in country places, where mothers, unknown to their hu&s;bands, inoculated their children, while they were, a&s;leep, and always with &s;ucce&s;s. M. Tronchin was the fir&s;t, for aught I know, that u&s;ed ve&s;icatories, as le&s;s pain|ful and le&s;s terrible to children. He applied them to the legs preferably to the arms, with the view of procuring, for the bed-rid patient, a greater liberty in his motions; but, as the e&s;&s;ence of inoculation con&s;i&s;ts intirely in the mixture of the variolous matter with the blood of the per|&s;on inoculated, it little &s;ignifies, provided the mixture
<PB N="15" REF="012825_0015_0F8B41BA5E3031F8">
operates, whether the wound from whence the blood is drawn, be made on one of &s;everal parts of the body; with a lancet as in England; with two or three needles as in Greece and Circa&s;&s;ia; with one only as in Italy; by pa&s;&s;|ing under the &s;kin a thread imbued with matter, as in Barbary; by rubbing the hand till the blood appears, as in the principality of Wales; or, la&s;tly, in breaking the texture of the epidermis with a ve&s;icatory, according to the practice of M. Tronchin. All the&s;e routes conduct to the &s;ame end, and each may chu&s;e that which &s;eems mo&s;t agreeable to him.</P>

<P><HI>Fir&s;t Objection.</HI> IS it the &s;mall-pox that is communicated by inoculation? And may not the di&s;|temper communicated be more dangerous than that which is intended to be prevented?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> If it was ever doubted that the inflammatory di&s;ea&s;e which follows inoculation, was a real &s;mall-pox, none now make the lea&s;t doubt about it; it would be there|fore unnece&s;&s;ary to an&s;wer the fir&s;t part of the objection. As to the &s;econd part, it may be &s;aid, that the natural &s;mall-pox is not dangerous in it&s;elf, but only becomes &s;o by a complication of di&s;orders with it, or by the maligni|ty of the epidemy. Such a per&s;on, cut off in the flower of his age, might &s;till have been living, were it not for be|ing attacked by the &s;mall-pox in critical circum&s;tances: That young woman would not have died, if the accidents
<PB N="16" REF="012825_0016_0F8B41BB1CB48E78">
of a laborious pregnancy had not exhau&s;ted her &s;trength: That young man would have been out of danger, had not his blood been inflamed by all manner of exce&s;&s;es: That &s;ick per&s;on might have e&s;caped, if a malignant fever and the purples had not aggravated his illne&s;s. This is what we daily hear of the circum&s;tances that make this di&s;tem|per mortal. Inoculation will prevent them all. The greate&s;t art of the preparation con&s;i&s;ts in preventing fo|reign accidents, a complication of di&s;orders, and the epi|demy; a proper choice may be made of the &s;ea&s;on, time, place, and the di&s;po&s;itions of the &s;ubject's mind and body; the &s;mall-pox thus prevented is brought &s;lowly from the circumference to the center, in a whole&s;ome body pre|pared for receiving it: Fermentation begins in the exter|nal parts; the artificial wounds facilitate the eruption, by giving the virus an ea&s;y i&s;&s;ue. Thus the inoculated &s;mall-pox is always &s;imple, and therefore without any danger.</P>
<P>What compari&s;on can be made between a premeditated di&s;ea&s;e and one contracted by chance, on a journey, in the army, in critical circum&s;tances, and e&s;pecially for women in a time of epidemy, which multiplies accidents, which tran&s;ports the &s;eat of the inflammation in the internal parts of a body, perhaps exhau&s;ted by watching or fatigue? How great is the difference between a di&s;ea&s;e which is ex|pected, and one that &s;urpri&s;es, di&s;mays, and fear alone may make mortal, or, appearing with equivocal &s;ymptoms, may lead into an error the able&s;t phy&s;icians? Such are the dictates of good &s;en&s;e, and the mo&s;t &s;imple rea&s;oning, but experience is &s;till more deci&s;ive; it proves that the matter of inoculation, though taken from a complicated &s;mall-pox, confluent, even mortal communicates, not|with&s;tanding, a &s;imple, di&s;crete, benign &s;mall-pox, exempt from the fever of &s;uppuration, &s;o frequently fatal; in &s;hort, a &s;mall-pox which leaves no marks. Hence it is evident that the inoculated &s;mall-pox is not more danger|ous than the natural</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="012825_0017_0F8B41BBDE3C3048"><HI>Second Objection.</HI> Does the inoculated &s;mall-pox &s;ave from the natural?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> This objection cannot be better an&s;wered, than by a hi&s;tory of facts, whereby it appears, that not one inoculated per&s;on had contracted the &s;mall-pox a &s;e|cond time. The enemies of this method have endeavour|ed by all manner of ways to elude this truth, even by that of impo&s;ture. Dr. Middleton was obliged to declare publicly again&s;t a report, that one of tho&s;e he had inoculated was again infected with the &s;mall-pox, of which he had been very ill. Mention was made of another, with the letter of one Jones, who a&s;&s;erted the &s;ame thing of his &s;on; Dr. Jurin examined carefully into the fact; the father refu&s;ed to &s;hew the child's marks, but offered afterwards to tell the truth provided he was well paid for &s;o doing: At la&s;t, he confe&s;&s;ed, in a letter to Dr. Jurin, that he knew nothing of inoculation. Dr. Kirkpatrick has in&s;erted this letter in his work.</P>
<P>But what does it &s;ignify to know whether a complete &s;mall-pox may be had twice naturally? Though this fact, which &s;everal phy&s;icians deny, and which Dr. Mead, in the cour&s;e of a long life, &s;ays he had never &s;een, &s;hould be well atte&s;ted, it would not nece&s;&s;arily follow that a per&s;on, after being inoculated, &s;hould be &s;ubject to have it again. Granting that it is po&s;&s;ible to have the &s;mall-pox, twice in the natural way, might not it be maintained, with &s;ome &s;hew of probability, that the natural cau&s;es of the con|tagion do not &s;hoot forth perhaps but imperfectly in a body the bud of the di&s;temper, &s;o that &s;ometives a &s;uffici|ency remains for a new fermetation; whereas the ferment of the &s;mall-pox, &s;et in motion by a virus of the &s;ame na|ture introduced directly into the blood by the means of &s;everal inci&s;ions, flows out in &s;o complete a manner, that no more matter remains to form a &s;econd eruption. A more powerful cau&s;e ought to produce a greater effect: Milk turns and coagulates more &s;urely and effectually by the direct mixture of an acid, than by the natural action
<PB N="18" REF="012825_0018_0F8B41BCA8CB5C00">
of air and heat: The artificial &s;mall-pox may therefore exhau&s;t the leaven which the natural may not. But, &s;et|ting a&s;ide the&s;e rea&s;ons, will it not be &s;ufficient to &s;ay, in order to avert the dread of a &s;econd &s;mall-pox after inocu|lation, that now, upwards of 30 years &s;ince it became fre|quent in England, no example can be produced of any inoculated per&s;on, who had been again infected, either na|turally or artificially? Tho&s;e, on whom inoculation might have been attempted without effect, are improperly ranked in the number of the inoculated; the operation well or ill conducted, when it produces neither pu&s;tule nor &s;uppura|tion, leaves the &s;uject in the &s;ame &s;tate he was in; if therefore he is afterwards attacked by the natural &s;mall-pox, it cannot be &s;aid that he has had it twice.</P>
<P>Some inoculated children have been made to cohabit and lie with others ill of the &s;pontaneous &s;mall-pox, and none of them took it a &s;econd time. Eli&s;abeth Harris, one of &s;ix criminals inoculated on the fir&s;t trial, after re|covery, nur&s;ed upwards of twenty per&s;ons &s;ick of the &s;mall-pox, and the contagion had no effect upon her. Inoculation has been repeated &s;everal times on different &s;ubjects; but the effects of the fir&s;t being over, the inci&s;i|ons, notwith&s;tanding the thread imbued with virus, healed as &s;light cuts: It is therefore evident that the variolic virus, though mixed directly with the blood, is incapable of renewing the &s;mall-pox; from whence it may be con|cluded with good rea&s;on, that the natural contagion, intro|duced by the air, will have no effect on a body purged of this leaven by inoculation.</P>
<P><HI>Third Objection.</HI> The &s;mall parcel of venom, tran&s;mit|ted into the blood by the way of inoculation, may be the bud or &s;eed of other di&s;tempers, which may be communi|cated the &s;ame way, &s;uch as the &s;curvy, King's evil, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> The ri&s;que of catching the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, at the &s;ame time with the &s;mall-pox, would not be le&s;s great, when it is contracted naturally, than when it is received by inoculation. However, as no in&s;tance has been &s;een of
<PB N="19" REF="012825_0019_0F8B41BDA179EA70">
&s;curvy, King's evil, &amp;c. contracted in this manner by the con|tagion of the natural &s;mall-pox; why &s;hould the danger be greater in this re&s;pect by the way of inoculation? This is not all: There are po&s;itive proofs that this danger is chimerical, and it is now known by experience, that the variolic matter, though taken from a body infected al&s;o with a venereal virus, communicated only a &s;imple and benign &s;mall-pox: This fact, deci&s;ive and not admitting a reply, is atte&s;ted in Dr. Maty's Briti&s;h Journal, for April, 1754, pag. 403; yet, as the choice of matter for inocu|lation may be di&s;cretionally made, nothing hinders the taking of it from a whole&s;ome &s;ubject, and e&s;pecially from a child who has no other di&s;temper than the &s;mall-pox it&s;elf&punc;</P>
<P><HI>Fourth Objection.</HI> Inoculation is &s;ometimes attended with trouble&s;ome con&s;equences, as wounds, tumors, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> Nothing is more unju&s;t than this objection: The&s;e accidents are but too frequent after the natural &s;mall-pox, but very rare after inoculation; they are pre|vented by purgatives.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>MORAL OBJECTIONS.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t Objection.</HI> It would be an u&s;urpation of the rights of the Divinity to afflict with a di&s;ea&s;e one who has it not, or to endeavour to withdraw him from it, who, in the order of Providence, was naturally de&s;tined for having it.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> This objection, if it can be called &s;o, is that of Fatali&s;ts and rigid Prede&s;tinarians. They might be an&s;wered that the inoculated was prede&s;tined for inocula|tion, and that by inoculating him the decrees of Provi|dence were accompli&s;hed; but, without retorting again&s;t them this &s;ingular argument, they may be a&s;ked, Whe|ther confidence in Providence exempts and di&s;pen&s;es us from preventing the ills we fore&s;ee, and which we may &s;ecure our&s;elves from by a prudent attention. Tho&s;e of this principle, if they act con&s;equently to it, ought to pro&s;cribe the u&s;e of all remedies of precaution, and of all pre&s;ervatives; they ought to imitate the example of the Turks, who, thro' fear of acting contrary to the views of
<PB N="20" REF="012825_0020_0F8B41BE3374DA00">
Providence, peri&s;h by thou&s;ands in times of pe&s;tilence &s;o frequent at Con&s;tantinople, whil&s;t they &s;ee the Franks, &s;ettled among them, &s;ecure them&s;elves from the fatal ef|fects of the contagion, both in town and country, by &s;hut|ting them&s;elves up carefully in their hou&s;es, to avoid all exterior communication; tho&s;e who here plead the rights of Divine Providence, may therefore be a&s;ked, Whether, when Providence permits the di&s;covery of a &s;ure method of pre&s;ervation from the ravages of the &s;mall-pox, we are forbid to make u&s;e of it? It is Providence that pre&s;ents us with the remedy, and it would be an offence to reject its gifts with contempt.</P>
<P><HI>Sixth Objection.</HI> It is not allowable to infect with a cruel and dangerous di&s;ea&s;e one who perhaps may never have it.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> It cannot be &s;aid, with any &s;hew of truth, that the inoculated &s;mall-pox is either cruel or dangerous. An inci&s;ion which only cuts through the &s;urface of the &s;kin, a &s;imple puncture, or the application of a ve&s;icatory, a &s;light fever attended with &s;ome &s;ymptoms which &s;carce la&s;t 24 hours, cannot be &s;aid to con&s;titute a cruel di&s;ea&s;e; and a di&s;|ea&s;e, by which not above one may die in 300, or perhaps not one in a thou&s;and, cannot be called dangerous. It may even be doubtful, whether this death of one, out of &s;o many, can be ju&s;tly attributed to inoculation.</P>
<P>But if, out of 320 per&s;ons taken at chance, one com|monly dies, how comes it to pa&s;s that M. Ranby did not lo&s;e one in 1200? The rea&s;on is, his choice was confined to young &s;ubjects of &s;ound con&s;titutions. When per&s;ons of all ages are inoculated without choice or precaution, as was done at Bo&s;ton in the fir&s;t trials, the greater part &s;u&s;|pected of corrupt blood and humours, and in a time of epidemy, when &s;everal, before undergoing the operation, had already probably received the di&s;ea&s;e by natural con|tagion, there will be no room for being &s;urpri&s;ed that one died in 49 or 50.</P>
<P>It may therefore be granted, that the inoculated &s;mall-pox is neither dangerous, nor cruel, as the objection &s;up|po&s;es it. `But it will be &s;aid, it cannot be denied to be a
<PB N="21" REF="012825_0021_0F8B41C037C125C8">
di&s;ea&s;e; why therefore &s;hould it be given gratis to one who perhaps might never have it?' This is the mo&s;t &s;peci|ous of all the arguments that can be made again&s;t this prac|tice, and yet the ea&s;ie&s;t to be refuted.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, fir&s;t, that this di&s;ea&s;e is not given to one who might never have it naturally. For, either all men, with|out exception, are &s;ubject to the &s;mall-pox, or &s;ome are free from it: In the fir&s;t ca&s;e, it cannot be &s;aid that the di&s;ea&s;e is given to one who might never have it: The &s;ame will hold good in the &s;econd, it being proved by experi|ence, that &s;ome could not get the &s;mall pox by inoculation, though the operation had been &s;everal times repeated; no doubt they were no way di&s;po&s;ed to receive the di&s;tem|per. He who has not the principle of it in his blood, will be free from it by an operation le&s;s painful than a bleed|ing; the inci&s;ions will dry up as a &s;light cut: Thus he will &s;ee him&s;elf for ever delivered from the continual un|ea&s;ine&s;s tho&s;e are under, who have not yet paid the tribute; this proof will be a &s;ecurity to him that he is for ever &s;afe from the contagion. It is even the only way of bani&s;hing the fears of tho&s;e, who, by not having the &s;mall-pox in a deci&s;ive manner, or not knowing that they had it in their infancy, &s;pend their days &s;o as to make life a puni&s;hment. Therefore a di&s;ea&s;e, as the objection &s;uppo&s;es, is not given to one who might never have it.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, in the &s;econd place, that the &s;mall-pox is a di&s;ea&s;e which may be called general, and to which Provi|dence is willing mankind &s;hould be &s;ubject; that the number of tho&s;e who arrive at old-age without having it, is &s;o &s;mall, that it &s;carce forms exceptions to the common law. But what is done by inoculating the &s;mall-pox? The very &s;ame thing whereby a fit of the gout is excited, when the particles of that painful di&s;order are di&s;per&s;ed throughout the ma&s;s of the blood; in both ca&s;es a di&s;tem|per is not &s;o much given to a body free from contracting it, as the mo&s;t favourable time is cho&s;en to give vent to the ferment that occa&s;ions it, and which we all have in our
<PB N="22" REF="012825_0022_0F8B41C05D7D0AB0">
blood; the venting of which ferment is almo&s;t inevitable in regard to the &s;mall-pox, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ch more dangerous when it comes of it&s;elf, and e&s;pec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">y in a time of epidemy.</P>
<P><HI>Seventh Objection.</HI> It is not allowable to do a le&s;s evil, to procure a greater good.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> This objection is founded on an equivocati|on. Let us &s;uppo&s;e that this principle is in rigour and generally true, and that it admits no exception, no re&s;tric|tion, as to moral evil; but it is very fal&s;e in the applica|tion made of it to phy&s;ical evil. Certainly it is allowable to pull down a hou&s;e to pre&s;erve a town or city from a conflagration, though the proprietor of this hou&s;e with his family, might be reduced to beggary by &s;o doing; a whole province may be laid under water, or ruined for &s;everal years, in the view of preventing the further ravages of an enemy; a &s;hip, if &s;u&s;pected to have the plague on board, though perhaps ready to peri&s;h, is refu&s;ed admittance into a port: And thus the incon&s;iderable phy&s;ical evil of inocu|lation is nothing, if compared with the evils of all &s;orts which are tolerated, permited, and authori&s;ed by the laws of mo&s;t nations.</P>
<P><HI>Eighth Objection.</HI> Inoculation is a moral evil; as a proof of which, it cannot be denied but &s;ome inoculated per&s;ons have died; the &s;ucce&s;s of the method is therefore not infallible; one cannot therefore &s;ubject him&s;elf to it without expo&s;ing his life, which he is not allowed to di&s;|po&s;e of: Therefore inoculation runs counter to the prin|ciples of morality.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> Fir&s;t, the objection may be cut &s;hort by maintaining, that none die of the inoculated &s;mall-pox, and that the accidents, attributed to inoculation, are owing to no other cau&s;e than the imprudence of the &s;ick, or of the phy&s;ician: Several able phy&s;icians have been of this opi|nion: M. Tronchin was &s;o thoroughly per&s;uaded of it, that he declared openly, if he lo&s;t one &s;ingle patient by the artificial &s;mall-pox, he would inoculate no more while he lived.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="012825_0023_0F8B41C11CA1E908">Secondly, the argument, here advanced again&s;t inocula|tion, may be retorted again&s;t bleeding in the arm: How many have died by the pricking of arteries? It is then cer|tain that life is endangered by bleeding in the arm, which cannot with the &s;ame evidence be a&s;certained in regard to inoculation; yet no ca&s;ui&s;t has hitherto been &s;o &s;crupulous, as to forbid letting blood in the arm.</P>
<P>Thirdly, it may be ob&s;erved that the &s;uppo&s;ed &s;ingulari|ty of inoculation, that is, of giving a di&s;temper one has not, is common to this pre&s;ervative and all other remedies of medicine, no natural di&s;order being cured but by arti|ficial evils, which are not even exempt from danger, &s;uch as bleedings, purgatives, cauteries, ve&s;icatories, vomi|tives, &amp;c.</P>
<P>It is granted that it is the duty of every one to avoid the dangers life may be threatened with; but what becomes of this obligation when the danger is inevitable? It is evi|dently converted into that of le&s;&s;ening the danger as much as po&s;&s;ible; but the ri&s;que of having &s;ome time or other the &s;mall-pox, and perhaps dying of it, is inevitable in re|gard to him who never had it; therefore inoculation is a &s;ure means of dimini&s;hing, in a great degree, this danger.</P>
<P>It is evident, that, when the &s;mall-pox is expected from the hands of nature, the parties expo&s;e them&s;elves to die &s;ome time or other; but this ri&s;que is beheld as far di&s;tant, becau&s;e it &s;eems it &s;hould not begin but when the attacks are felt, which are not yet, and perhaps, as they flatter them&s;elves, may never be. To determine exactly the re&s;que of death incurred by him who never had the natural &s;mall-pox, it would be nece&s;&s;ary to know what part of mankind is not &s;ubject to the di&s;ea&s;e; but it may be &s;aid with good rea&s;on, that the in&s;tances of tho&s;e who pa&s;s thro' life, after having arrived at manhood, and having been within the reach of infection, without undergoing this dire|ful di&s;ea&s;e, are &s;o extremely few, as &s;carce to form an ex|ception; learned calculations have made it as one to many hundreds.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="012825_0024_0F8B41C26DC59720">The ri&s;que of dying one time or other of the &s;mall-pox, which &s;eems &s;o far di&s;tant in time of health, is almo&s;t as great as if one was already effected. In a word, of 70 &s;ick of the &s;mall-pox, 10 die; of 70 who expect it, 9 will probably die: Could it be believed that between the&s;e two ri&s;ques there was &s;o little difference?</P>
<P>The ri&s;que of dying of the &s;mall-pox gradually increa&s;es from the moment of birth. This re&s;que is of a fourteenth for a new-born child; of an eighth for one of a year old; of a &s;eventh for the u&s;ual age of inoculation; later, it is of a &s;ixth, fifth, fourth, and perhaps there are only two to one, which upon a wager could be laid for the life of him, who arrives at the age of thirty without having paid the fatal tribute.</P>
<P>The ri&s;que of death one is expo&s;ed to by waiting from nature for the fatal pre&s;ent of the &s;mall-pox, is therefore of 9 to 70, that is, of more than an eighth: The ri&s;que of dying by inoculation is computed at 1 to 376, by more than 6000 experiments. Hence it may be &s;aid, that a father, in regard to his &s;on, has only the option, either to inoculate him or not; here are two hazards to run, of which one is inevitable. By inoculating his &s;on, again&s;t 375 fortunate events, one is to be dreaded; by not inocu|lating him there is more than one to be laid again&s;t &s;even that he will lo&s;e him; for, if out of 70 nine die, the bett will be of nine again&s;t 61, which is more than one again&s;t &s;even; &s;o that, this la&s;t ri&s;que being 50 times greater than the other, he cannot with rea&s;on he&s;itate in his choice.</P>
<P>This calculation is not exaggerated. Dr. Jurin, hav|ing judged from his fir&s;t enumerations, that, one year with another, there died a &s;eventh of tho&s;e taken ill of the &s;mall-pox, found on further and more exact information, fir&s;t in 14,500, and afterwards in upwards of 17,000 per&s;ons, that often one in five died, and commonly two in eleven; &s;o that the peril of the natural &s;mall-pox has not been exag|gerated by &s;uppo&s;ing one in &s;even. As to inoculation, in|&s;tead of the ri&s;que of one again&s;t 375, as &s;uppo&s;ed, it is
<PB N="25" REF="012825_0025_0F8B41C317A1C248">
proved by the con&s;tant &s;ucce&s;s of this operation in the London &s;mall-pox ho&s;pital, on per&s;ons of all ages, that the peril of this method has rather by the calculation been augmented than dimini&s;hed.</P>
<P>Whatever might be the advantage of the artificial &s;mall-pox, even though one &s;hould not die in 10,000, I would not advi&s;e a father to &s;ubject his &s;on to it, if he could be &s;ure that the natural &s;mall-pox would &s;pare him; but &s;ince, in|&s;tead of a like revelation, which we want, the father has only the certainty of danger by far greater to which he ex|po&s;es his &s;on, in letting nature act, it is evident that rea&s;on coun&s;els him, and that paternal tenderne&s;s requires, he &s;hould dimini&s;h, as much as he po&s;&s;ibly can, a ri&s;que he cannot make void.</P>
<P>Such is the fate of humanity: Upwards of a third of tho&s;e who are born, are de&s;tined to die, in the fir&s;t year of their life, by incurable di&s;ea&s;es, or at lea&s;t unknown: E&s;|caped from this fir&s;t danger, the ri&s;que of dying of the &s;mall-pox becomes inevitable to them; it &s;heds its influ|ence on the whole cour&s;e of life, and in every in&s;tant of time increa&s;es; it is a forced lottery wherein we find our|&s;elves concerned, in &s;pite of us; each of us has a ticket in it, and the longer it delays coming out of the wheel, the more the danger augments. What is done by the practice of inoculation? The conditions of this lottery are changed; the number of fatal tickets is dimini&s;hed: One in &s;even, and in more favourable climates, one in ten was fatal, by the natural &s;mall-pox: By inoculation, one in 300, one in 500, one in 1000, of which we have examples. All fu|ture ages will envy ours this di&s;covery: Nature decima|ted, but art mille&s;imi&s;es us.</P>

<HEAD>PART III. <HI>Containing new An&s;wers, Con&s;equences drawn from Facts, Reflections,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>HERETOFORE, to avoid entering into long di&s;cu&s;|&s;ions, I rea&s;oned according to the &s;uppo&s;ition that there was &s;ome ri&s;que in the practice of inoculation, and I confined my&s;elf to prove that this ri&s;que was &s;o &s;mall, compared with that incurred by the natural &s;mall-pox, that it may be deemed, as of no account. And, indeed, the ri&s;que of one in 300, 500, or 1000, is not of the &s;ame kind, and &s;till le&s;s than that to which one is daily expo&s;ed voluntarily and without the lea&s;t nece&s;&s;ity. Some u&s;e violent and dangerous exerci&s;es, &s;uch as hunting, riding po&s;t on hor&s;eback, playing at tennis, &amp;c. others traver&s;e the &s;eas, and have frequently certain death before their eyes. Shall it be &s;aid, that it is allowable to hazard one's life habitually out of curio&s;ity, pa&s;time, humour, or at be&s;t through a motive of convenience or pecuniary intere&s;t; and that it is criminal, I will not &s;ay to run once a very &s;mall ri&s;que in the view of preventing a great danger, but to convert a great ri&s;que which cannot be annhiliated, into one 10, 20, 30, &amp;c. times le&s;s? Such is the con&s;e|quence the adver&s;aries of inoculation are reduced to, and that, &s;uppo&s;ing even that it is not exempt from all danger: What would it be if the pretended ri&s;que was ab&s;olutely nothing, as &s;everal eminent phy&s;icians are of opinion, and as &s;ome propo&s;e to make it evident?</P>
<P>As I &s;hall not engage in a di&s;&s;ertation on a &s;ubject, which, in order to be well treated, would require a profound knowledge both in the theory and practice of phy&s;ic, I &s;hall confine my&s;elf to &s;imple reflections. What can be the danger of inoculation? Is it in the operation or in its effect?</P>
<P><HI>New Objection.</HI> It is in both: A purulent matter, ta|ken from a body infected with a dangerous di&s;ea&s;e, is in|&s;erted
<PB N="27" REF="012825_0027_0F8B41C41EB18B40">
into the blood of a &s;ound per&s;on. Mu&s;t not this create horror? A like cau&s;e cannot fail of producing a pernicious effect.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> Let us not take words for things: Let us leave to children puerile niceties, and let us remember that if rea&s;on had not triumphed over prejudices, and the natural repugnancy the di&s;&s;ection of a human body in&s;pires, all the di&s;orders anatomy has di&s;covered remedies for, would be incurable. Is not nature &s;hocked at the &s;ight of the amputation of a limb, the perforation of the thorax in the empyema, cutting for the &s;tone, the trepan, &amp;c. All the&s;e operations are very cruel, their &s;ucce&s;s very doubtful, and the danger of dying very great; yet they are confidently practi&s;ed every day: What a prodigious difference between them and inoculation!</P>
<P>I made a di&s;tinction between the operation and effects of inoculation. As to the operation, it has nothing terrible or dangerous. A &s;uperficial inci&s;ion on the &s;kin differs from a &s;cratch only, in that the latter would be more pain|ful: But will it be &s;aid that one can die of a &s;cratch?</P>
<P>As to the effects of the operation, experience decides what they are. I &s;hall not endeavour to examine whether the contagious venom of the epidemy is only in the air that is breathed, that is, in an exterior cau&s;e; from whence it would follow that the choice of a &s;ubject which furni&s;hes the matter of inoculation is indifferent: All I &s;hall ob&s;erve is, that, &s;ince the choice not only of a &s;ubject, but al&s;o of the mo&s;t benign and be&s;t conditioned &s;mall-pox can be made, tho&s;e who chu&s;e it &s;uch, cannot be cen&s;ured for in|&s;erting in the veins of a &s;ound man the produce of a dan|gerous illne&s;s. Be&s;ides, it is proved by the experience of &s;everal ages, as well in A&s;ia as Africa, and of near an age in Europe, that, in the hands of an able practitioner, the danger vani&s;hes by the choice of a &s;ubject, by preparation, &amp;c. that inoculation occa&s;ions only a &s;imple &s;mall-pox, which gives vent to the greate&s;t part of the venom through the inci&s;ions, and which therefore is &s;carce ever confluent,
<PB N="28" REF="012825_0028_0F8B41C4DD157EE0">
but always more benign than the natural. It is moreover proved, that it leaves no marks, and that it is not attended with the fever of &s;uppuration, &s;o common and &s;o fatal in the natural &s;mall-pox. Can any thing more be wanting to conclude, that the life of a patient is &s;ecured in the inocu|lated &s;mall-pox by the pre&s;cribed precautions, and that the accidents which might have attended it in a very &s;mall number of ca&s;es, ought to be attributed to foreign cau&s;es? Is it not evident by the laws of probability, that, among thou&s;ands of inoculated &s;ubjects, &s;ome one may and &s;hould die, not only forty days after, but in the week, and per|haps on the day, by the &s;ame rea&s;on that this per&s;on might pay the tribute to nature eight days, one day, or one hour befors the operation? Inoculation prevents the dangers and con&s;equences of the natural &s;mall-pox; but it is not therefore a remedy again&s;t all the di&s;orders incident to &s;o complex a machine as the human body, and &s;till le&s;s a pre&s;ervative again&s;t &s;udden death.</P>
<P>In order to remove all impediments thrown in my way by the quibbles of the adver&s;aries of this mothod, I found|ed all my calculations on &s;uppo&s;itions made as they fancied them&s;elves; but it is now time to lay in my claim to truth. Let us then fir&s;t retrench, from the number of the pre|tended victims of this operation, tho&s;e who die of foreign accidents, as, for in&s;tance, children at the brea&s;t, &s;uddenly cut off, in the cour&s;e of a very benign &s;mall-pox, by a convul&s;ion or cholic, which happens but too frequently to other children of their age, who &s;eem to enjoy the be&s;t &s;tate of health; let us not lay to the account of the artifi|cial &s;mall-pox the death of tho&s;e, who, in a time of epidemy, have already received the di&s;temper by the natural conta|gion, before they were inoculated: This may well be pre&s;umed, when the &s;ymptoms appear before the time when it is u&s;ual with the operation to produce its effect. Let us al&s;o except, as it is ju&s;t, on one &s;ide, the deaths occa&s;i|oned by intemperance, or other exce&s;&s;es the patients were &s;ubject to; and, on the other, the accidents which ought
<PB N="29" REF="012825_0029_0F8B41C5B3006580">
vi&s;ibly to be attributed to the imprudence of inoculators in making trials; the&s;e accidents are now more rare, but were frequent enough when the method was fir&s;t intro|duced. When all the&s;e exceptions are made, of which we hitherto made none, there will not remain perhaps a &s;in|gle per&s;on who&s;e death can be properly imputed to ino|culation.</P>
<P>Make choice of a &s;ound, young &s;ubject, and of a good con&s;titution; let a &s;kilful phy&s;ician be careful in prepar|ing him; pre&s;erve him from the epidemical contagion; inoculate him; his life is &s;afe.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;t Objection.</HI> It is &s;uppo&s;ed that inoculation of it&s;elf is never mortal, but it may be &s;aid, that he who might not have died perhaps of the natural &s;mall-pox till the age of fifty, after having had children, after having &s;erved his country, would be lo&s;t for &s;ociety, if he died in his infancy of the inoculated &s;mall-pox.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> This objection is more &s;pecious than &s;olid, being grounded on the &s;uppo&s;ition of the real danger of inoculation; it will be therefore unnece&s;&s;ary to animad|vert upon its weakne&s;s, even the ca&s;e of inoculation being not ab&s;olutely without danger: It is clear that even then the great inequality of ri&s;ques in the natural and artificial &s;mall-pox, the uncertainty as to the time of life in being attacked by the former, and the danger of dying &s;o much the more great, as age is more advanced, are &s;o many deci&s;ive rea&s;ons in favour of inoculation.</P>
<P>What has been already mentioned, that the &s;mall-pox de&s;troys, mutilates, or disfigures the fourth of mankind, may be taken for an exaggeration; but I mean the fourth of tho&s;e who &s;urvive the fir&s;t di&s;ea&s;es of infancy: This may appear from the following reflections.</P>
<P>Towards the end of the 16th century, about 50 years after the di&s;covery of Peru, this di&s;temper was brought from Europe to Carthagena in America; it over|ran the whole continent of the new world, and, in the pro|vince of Quito alone, de&s;troyed upwards of 100,000 In|dians. This remark has been taken from an antient ma|nu&s;cript
<PB N="30" REF="012825_0030_0F8B41C65C92BE38">
of the cathedral of that city. In the Portugue&s;e colonies the &s;mall-pox proved fatal to all the original in|habitants of the country. M. Maitland, to whom England is indebted from the u&s;e of inoculation, relates that there are years when the &s;mall-pox is a kind of plague in the Levant, which kills at lea&s;t the third of tho&s;e it infects; this terrible proportion is not rare in Barbary. If we con&s;ult Dr. Jurin's li&s;ts, or tho&s;e annexed to his work, among others, Dr. Nettleton's, who informed him&s;elf in &s;everal towns from hou&s;e to hou&s;e of the number of the &s;ick and dead throughout the year (the &s;ure&s;t way of being exact) it will be &s;een that at London, and in other parts of England, there died &s;ome years a fifth, and &s;ometimes more of tho&s;e taken ill of the &s;mall-pox; but among tho&s;e who do not die of it, how many remain deprived of hear|ing or &s;ight, intirely or partly! How many affected in the brea&s;t and lungs, langui&s;hing, valetudinarians, maimed! How many others, disfiguared for life by deformed &s;eams and &s;cars, become objects of horror to tho&s;e that approach them! La&s;tly, in the &s;ex where comline&s;s is &s;o great an advantage, how many lo&s;e their charms, &s;ome the tender|ne&s;s of their hu&s;bands, others the hopes of being &s;ettled in the world, whence a real lo&s;s accrues to the &s;tate.</P>
<P>The &s;mall-pox rai&s;es a tribute of a fourteenth on man|kind, and, though the number of victims wounded by its darts &s;hould not &s;urpa&s;s the number of tho&s;e it &s;trikes mortally, it will notwith&s;tanding be always true, that, out of 100 per&s;ons who have e&s;caped the fir&s;t dangers of in|fancy, thirteen or fourteen are cut off by this di&s;temper, and that a like number exhibit in them&s;elves, during their whole life, all the di&s;agreeablene&s;s of its di&s;mal con&s;equen|ces. There are then, in 100 per&s;ons, 26 or 28 witne&s;&s;es to prove that this plague de&s;troys or degrades the fourth of mankind.</P>
<P>The number of experiments already cited demon&s;trates that inoculation prevents all the&s;e calamities. The ino|culated &s;mall-pox is not only neither mortal nor danger|ous,
<PB N="31" REF="012825_0031_0F8B41C98205FD78">
but it leaves nothing after it that might make it re|membered with regret; this con&s;ideration alone &s;eems deci&s;ive for that half of mankind, to whom beauty in a great mea&s;ure is &s;ometimes dearer than life. The a&s;to|ni&s;hing contra&s;t, M. Maty &s;ays, that may be ob&s;erved in vi&s;iting the &s;mall-pox ho&s;pital, between the inoculated, and tho&s;e who had the natural &s;mall-pox, in regard to the effects of the di&s;temper on the face, would be alone &s;uffi|cient to determine tho&s;e who make &s;ome account of the advantage of not being disfigured.</P>
<P>The&s;e are not conjectures hazarded by a &s;y&s;tematic genius: They are the re&s;ult of facts di&s;cu&s;&s;ed contradicto|rily, and publi&s;hed in the face of the world by learned di|vines, &s;kilful phy&s;icians, and able &s;urgeons; they are war|ranted, and have received a &s;ufficient &s;anction from the great names and authority of Sydenham and Boerhaave; the Bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter; Dr. Jurin, Secretary to the Roy|al Society; Dr. Mead, the Engli&s;h Hippocrates; and M. Ranby, fir&s;t Surgeon to his Britannic Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>Prudence advi&s;ed and directed that too much precipi|tation &s;hould be guarded again&s;t in adopting a delu&s;ive no|velty; it was nece&s;&s;ary that time &s;hould throw a new light on its utility: Upwards of thirty years experience has cleared up all doubts, and perfected the method; the li&s;ts of tho&s;e that died of the &s;mall-pox have dimini&s;hed by a fifth in England, &s;ince the practice of inoculation became more common; it is a truth that &s;eems no longer conte&s;ted in London, that the inoculated &s;mall-pox is infi|nitely le&s;s dangerous than the natural, and that it pre&s;erves from it. Heretofore in England this operation was bit|terly inveighed again&s;t, but now it has not one enemy that dares to attack it openly: The evidence of facts, and e&s;|pecially the &s;hame of maintaining a forlorn cau&s;e, have &s;hut up the mouths of its mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate adver&s;aries.</P>

<P>"HAVING well con&s;idered the &s;ubject of inocula|tion, and the &s;tate of the laws re&s;pecting it in this Colony, and likewi&s;e con&s;idering what great improve|ments have been made in Europe and America, in the management of both, the natural, and artificial &s;mall-pox, &s;ince them laws were enacted: Thought it highly pro|bable if it could be made appear that inoculation might be practi&s;ed at the pe&s;t-hou&s;e at Middletown, with &s;afety to the public we might be indulged. Now it is a known fact that when, &s;ome years &s;ince, inoculation was practi|&s;ed at &s;everal ho&s;pitals in this government, the public &s;uf|fered by its being communicated from almo&s;t every ho&s;|pital. I have this to &s;ay in favour of our being indulged at Middletown, that near three hundred per&s;ons have had the di&s;ea&s;e at our pe&s;t-hou&s;e, without one in&s;tance of the di&s;order being communicated from &s;aid hou&s;e. Farther, I believe any per&s;on of &s;en&s;e, will allow, that it is proba|ble, that betwixt October and May &s;e&s;&s;ions, a con&s;idera|ble number of per&s;ons may have the &s;mall-pox at Middle|town pe&s;t-hou&s;e much to their intere&s;t and peace of mind without the government being in the lea&s;t expos'd there|by.

Ought a mere po&s;&s;ibility of my acting being injurious to my neighbour to prevent my acting, when it is apparent that my acting will be much to my intere&s;t and I &s;tand ready to give him all the &s;ecuri|ty he can de&s;ire that my conduct &s;hall not injure him, and

if it does that I will pay all rea&s;onable damages? In mo&s;t of our concerns in life we are obliged to act on probabi|lity, now I think it may be made appear, that it is as probable that I, with a number of my neighbours may have the &s;mall-pox at the pe&s;t-hou&s;e in Middletown, with|out a &s;ingle inhabitant of &s;aid town being injured there|by, as it is probable that a man could ride from New-Haven to Hartford in a given time, (viz.) 10 hours. I now beg it as a favour of the Government, that I with a number more, (who two years &s;ince, &s;olicited the legi&s;la|ture for liberty to &s;uffer inoculation at the pe&s;t-hou&s;e in Middletown, our phy&s;ician being our inoculator) may be inoculated as above. We &s;tand ready to give bond, for our prudent conduct, are willing to be under the in&s;pection of a committee, or the authority and &s;elect men of &s;aid Middletown, as the legi&s;lative &s;hall think proper. It is, I believe, evident that a greater number of people have &s;uffered the natural &s;mall-pox in this government con|&s;equent of inoculated patients coming from abroad with|out being duly clean&s;ed, than from an internal inoculation. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I my&s;elf was knowing to about &s;ixty people having the &s;mall-pox two years &s;ince in this government, con&s;equent of &s;ome per&s;ons coming from inoculation abroad, without being duly clean&s;ed.</NOTE> Numbers of the inhabitants of this colony within this &s;ix years have been inoculated at Eu&s;opus, Poughkeep&s;ie, Nor|walk, and New-York, and have traver&s;ed the government with infected apparel endangering the public, which dan|ger will be greatly le&s;&s;ened, if not wholly removed, by a well regulated internal inoculation.</P>
<P>Farther, I think when it is con&s;idered what great &s;ums of money are yearly &s;ent to New-York, to pay them for importing for us Engli&s;h goods, it will be an inducement to indulge us in our reque&s;t, to be inoculated at home, when it may be demon&s;trated that we can be inoculated at home with greater ea&s;e, le&s;s expence <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I have known &s;everal young gentlemen, who procuring inocula|tion abroad, have been expos'd from 10 to 20 pounds expence.&mdash; We judge inoculation will not co&s;t us more than three pounds a head, if indulged in our pre&s;ent reque&s;t.</NOTE> and va&s;tly more &s;afety to the community.</P>

<P>I Have read over the hi&s;tory of inoculation for the &s;mall-pox, you put into my hands, with plea&s;ure; the author, I think has fully refuted the arguments again&s;t the practice, d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">uced from the tophics of religion and mo|rality; and there remains no rea&s;onable objection again&s;t the admi&s;&s;ion of the full and free u&s;e of it, as the noble&s;t and be&s;t pre&s;ervative again&s;t the ravages of that fatal di&s;|temper in tho&s;e Countries, where it prevails without re|&s;traint, e&s;pecially if we take into con&s;ideration the great improvements made in the practice of inoculation &s;ince Mon&s;ieur La Condamine wrote; but as you de&s;ired my &s;entiments, whether it could be prudent to introduce in|oculation for the &s;mall-pox (if permitted by law) to ge|neral u&s;e in this colony, I freely an&s;wer I think it would not.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of this colony is &s;uch, that the greater num|ber of Inhabitants in it may for &s;ome time yet to come, probably pa&s;s thro' life without being expos'd to that di&s;|ea&s;e, and &s;urely tho&s;e who are in no danger, want no &s;e|curity again&s;t danger, but were inoculation &s;et up and practi&s;ed by every phy&s;ician, in every place they thought proper, it would lay every one under a nece&s;&s;ity to inocu|late, or &s;tand expo&s;ed to the di&s;temper in the natural way, the former would load the colony with a great and unne|ce&s;&s;ary expence, which &s;he is liable to bear; the latter would be attended with &s;till greater expence, and would be&s;ides hazard the lives of numbers, e&s;pecially of the old and infirm and valetudinary. I am therefore fully per&s;ua|ded that the indi&s;criminate practice of inoculation here would be hurtful to us, and that the legal re&s;traints it now lies under are in the main, founded in good policy.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="012825_0035_0F8B41CC77416E78" MS="y">At the &s;ame time I freely confe&s;s to you I could hear|tily wi&s;h that the legi&s;lature would be plea&s;ed &s;o far to di&s;|pen&s;e with the pre&s;ent act again&s;t inoculation, as to per|mit it to be practi&s;ed in &s;ome pre&s;cribed place in each county, by approv'd phy&s;icians under the in&s;pection of &s;ome gentlemen capable to direct the due management of the ho&s;pitals, and guarded with &s;uch regulations as &s;hall appear nece&s;&s;ary to prevent the infection's being communicated from the ho&s;pitals.</P>
<P>This would &s;ave a great expence of money now carried out of the colony, and &s;ave to the inoculated the co&s;t of a long journey, which is greater than the co&s;t of inoculation after the journey is made&mdash;it would put in the power of parents who intend their children for &s;uch trades and pro|fe&s;&s;ions as will expo&s;e them to the &s;mall-pox, to give them the di&s;order when young, by which nearly all the remaining danger in inoculation will be avoided&mdash;and as government could have the whole under their immediate direction, the danger from per&s;ons returning from inocu|lation not well clean&s;ed, or with remaining infection upon them will be greatly le&s;&s;ened, if not wholly avoided.</P>
<P>'Tis true the &s;mall-pox has been &s;pread from the ho&s;|pitals for inoculation, which were &s;ome years ago u&s;ed in this colony, but that happened I believe, principally be|cau&s;e no one had &s;ufficient powers, by law, to re&s;train pa|tients a competent length of time after their recovery from the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
