<P>ALL Nature is full of GOD: He not only inhabits Eternity, but he fills Immen&s;ity: He is intimately pre&s;ent with all the Works of his Hands; upholding, &s;uperintending, ordering and directing all Things, through the immen&s;e Univer&s;e: His all-ruling Providence extends to the vegetable and animal, as well as to the rational Creation; and &s;o it does to all the dead Parts of Matter, thro' the whole created Sy&s;tem; in&s;omuch that there is not a Motion in the natural, nor a Thought in the intellectual World, but what is &s;ubject to his Controul.</P>
<P>As 'tis a Matter of great Importance, that a deep Sen&s;e of this &s;hould be fixed upon our Minds; the Holy Writings are admirably &s;uited and adapted to this Purpo&s;e: There is a remarkable Difference in this Re&s;pect, between the holy Scriptures, and human Compo&s;itions; the latter are wont to relate Facts and Events as they are; pointing us to the immediate Cau&s;es or Occa&s;ions of them; whereas the holy Scriptures are perpetually introducing
<PB N="6" REF="009417_0004_0F743B19DABE5BF8">
GOD in all the Scenes of Nature, and the Affairs and Tran&s;actions of Men; and repre&s;enting Him, as the &s;upreme Cau&s;e and Agent, "Who worketh all things according to the Coun&s;el of his own Will; without whom, not a Sparrow falls to the Ground; and by whom the Hairs of our Heads are all numbered." At the powerful Call of his Voice, the whole Univer&s;e of Things &s;prang into Being, into Regularity, Order and Harmony; and his own al|mighty Arm perpetually &s;u&s;tains the univer&s;al Frame. The Laws of Nature as they are called, are no other, than certain Methods or Rules fix'd by Him&s;elf; agreeably to which He governs the natural World. If it rains, 'tis "God that &s;endeth Rain on the Ju&s;t and on the Unju&s;t." If the &s;tor|my Winds ari&s;e, in the Language of In&s;piration, "The Lord hath his Way in the Whirlwind and in the Storms and the Clouds are the Du&s;t of his Feet." Nahum 1. 3. If it thunders, "The GOD of Glory thundereth, He thundereth marvelou&s;ly with the Voice of his Excellency." P&s;alm xxix. 3. Job xxxvii. 4, 5. If there is an Earthquake, "GOD &s;haketh the Earth out of her Place, and the Pillars thereof tremble." Job ix. 6. And if we go on to con&s;ider the Affairs of Men and Nations; the &s;ame Remark holds good. Does a Nation or Kingdom ri&s;e, pro&s;per and flouri&s;h; or, is it brought down to Ruin and De&s;olation; &s;till the Hand of the &s;upreme Ruler is to be acknowledged and adored. Is a Nation un&s;ucce&s;sful in War; "It is GOD that poureth Contempt upon Princes, and weak|neth the Strength of the Mighty." Or, does a Na|tion prevail in Battle, and carry on a War to a
<PB N="7" REF="009417_0004_0F743B19DABE5BF8">
&s;ucce&s;sful I&s;&s;ue, a de&s;ireable and happy Peace; "It is GOD that fighteth for his People; through him, they do valiantly; and he it is that treadeth down their Foes." Of every Deliverance and Sal|vation we receive; particular public and national Salvations; we are &s;till reminded to acknowledge and adore GOD, as the Author; and to render the Prai&s;e and Glory to Him. The&s;e Sentiments of Piety and Religion the holy Writings unitedly tend to in&s;pire; particularly that Portion of them, I have now read to you; "Offer unto GOD Thank&s;|giving, &amp;c.&mdash;" A careful Attention to the Works of Providence, and the Operations of GOD's Hand, is e|ver our Wi&s;dom and our Duty: And as we now have a particular Call to it; it is to be hoped, our Atten|tion will be particularly careful, &s;erious and devout.</P>
<P>The Words may be accomodated to the particu|lar Occa&s;ion, of the pre&s;ent Solemnity; and be thus treated and illu&s;trated.</P>

<P>I. <HI>We have been in Trouble;</HI> and who among Mankind have not? Into this apo&s;tate &s;inful World, Men are born to Trouble and Sorrow as the Sparks fly upwards: All the Individuals of the human Race, more or le&s;s drink of this bitter Cup. Aches

and Pains and Maladies without Number, Cro&s;&s;es and Di&s;appointments, and heart-felt Bereavements, are but &s;ome of the Sorrows and Troubles Man|kind are Subject to, in this Valley of Tears: And well would it be, very well, if the&s;e Sorrows were met and endur'd <HI>as</HI> from the Hand of GOD, the wi&s;e and good Governor of the World; with a calm and quiet Re&s;ignation to his Plea&s;ure; and a firm and &s;teady Reliance on his Providence and Grace.</P>
<P>And as for Our&s;elves, <HI>us</HI> in this Colony, and in this Land, including our Mother Kingdom; 'tis certain we have been in Trouble, great Trouble!&mdash;have been involv'd, for a long Time, in a bloody War with <HI>France</HI> and with the <HI>Savages</HI> of the Wil|derne&s;s; and for &s;ome Time, with <HI>Spain.</HI> War con&s;idered in it&s;elf, is a &s;ore and di&s;mal Calamity; and not to be entred upon, but with good Advice, and with a View to Peace: Nor does GOD wil|lingly afflict his People, with &s;o terrible a Scourge, but their Iniquities &s;eperate between GOD and them, and draw down his Judgments upon them. Sin is the Cau&s;e, the hated Cau&s;e and Origin of all the Mi&s;eries and Calamities that over&s;pread the Earth. 'Tis Sin that contracts the Brow of Heaven into Frowns; and &s;tirs up the Indignation of an holy GOD. We are a &s;inful, guilty and degenerate Peo|ple; and the GOD of our Fathers has been angry with us, and has called for the Sword of our popi&s;h and pagan Adver&s;aries, to avange the Quarrel of his broken Covenant and violated Law; and to cha&s;ti&s;e and puni&s;h us, for our many Land-defiling Sins and Abominations.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="009417_0005_0F743B1A393F9BF0">
If we look back to the Commencement of the late War, how illy were we prepared for it? How low was the Nation &s;unk into Indolence and Le|thargy? How little of a martial Spirit, and the old <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Bravery was to be found among them? How &s;adly did this bode, and how di&s;couraging and gloomy were our Pro&s;pects? Accordingly, &s;ome of the Events of the fir&s;t Year of the War were very calamitous and di&s;graceful; &s;uch as will &s;tain the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Annals, and mu&s;t be re&s;ented with Shame and Grief by every &s;en&s;ible <HI>Engli&s;hman.</HI></P>
<P>The War opened in the Year &s;eventeen hundred and fifty five, with the ill-conducted and un&s;uc|ce&s;sful March of General <HI>Braddock,</HI> again&s;t Fort <HI>Du Que&s;ne;</HI> a Fort erected by the <HI>French,</HI> on the Territory of his <HI>Britannic</HI> Maje&s;ty: This Di&s;grace and Overthrow was &s;ome what qualified by the Re|duction of <HI>Nova-Scotia,</HI> by Colonel <HI>Monckton;</HI> and Sir <HI>William John&s;on'</HI>s Victory over a <HI>French</HI> Army, near Lake <HI>George.</HI></P>
<P>The Year fifty-&s;ix will not be thought honora|ble to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Name or Hi&s;tory: The &s;candalous Behaviour of Admiral <HI>Byng</HI> in the <HI>Mediterranean;</HI> and in Con&s;equence of that, the Lo&s;s of the I&s;land of <HI>Minorca,</HI> cannot be recollected but with Shame and Regret. And not long after this, (for I mean not minutely to trace the &s;everal Steps of the War) what a melancholly and gloomy Period followed, to <HI>Great Britain</HI> and her Provinces. At Home, what Uncertainty, Darkne&s;s and Confu&s;ion attended the public Coun&s;els? And how were they embroil'd by Divi&s;ions and Di&s;tractions? Whil&s;t Defeat, Fru&s;|tration
<PB N="10" REF="009417_0006_0F743B1AF4D285A0">
and Shame attended the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Arms, in the &s;everal Quarters of the World.</P>
<P>Let us fix our Attention for a Moment or two on <HI>America,</HI> the original Object of the Conte&s;t, in which we are mo&s;t intimately concern'd, and to which therefore, I intend principally to confine the&s;e Remarks. How were our Fortre&s;&s;es and &s;trong Holds demoli&s;hed or burnt to A&s;hes? Our Coun|trymen and Friends captivated and butchered? Our Troops repul&s;ed and turned back with Fru&s;tration and Shame? At that gloomy Period, what Trem|bling took hold on us, and Confu&s;ion covered us? How did every Countenance gather Palene&s;s, and the Panic &s;pread through whole Provinces?</P>
<P>Did not the People of this Land tremble for the Ark of GOD, and all our dear Privileges? Appre|hen&s;ive, fearful, whether GOD would not permit an exa&s;perated Foe, elated with Succe&s;s and Victory, to carry the devouring Sword through the Land, at|tended with De&s;olation and wide-&s;preading Ruin. This was a dark Day to the <HI>Briti&s;h American</HI> Provin|ces; a Day of Sorrow and Trouble; a Day, on which, we were loudly call'd upon, to look above an Arm of Fle&s;h&mdash;to look to the GOD of Armies, the Supreme Ruler of the World, and our Cove|nant God, for Protection, Deliverance and Salva|tion. And did we not take that Cour&s;e? Which leads me to &s;ay,</P>
<P>II. <HI>We have call'd upon God in a Day of Trouble.</HI> "Call upon me in the Day of Trouble." In the Sea&s;on of our Darkne&s;s and Di&s;tre&s;s, we poured out our Supplications before the Mo&s;t High. Pray|er, daily Prayer to GOD, is a Duty incumbent on
<PB N="11" REF="009417_0006_0F743B1AF4D285A0">
every human Being, that under&s;tands what Prayer is: And for a Chri&s;tian, for one who names the Name of CHRIST to neglect Prayer, daily Prayer, is quite inexcu&s;able. In all our Ways we are to acknowledge GOD, and maintain an humble, holy Intercour&s;e with Him, through all the Tran&s;acti|ons and Affairs of our Lives. The Sen&s;e and Act|ings of our Hearts towards GOD, at all Times, &s;hould agree &amp; harmonize with the various Di&s;pen|&s;ations and A&s;pects of his Providence towards us: This is to maintain and enjoy Communion with GOD, in the De&s;pen&s;ations of his Providence. E|very Kindne&s;s and Smile of his Providence &s;hould be met with corre&s;pondent Gratitude, Thank&s;gi|ving and Prai&s;e: So, for every Thing we &s;tand in Need of for Time or Eternity, we are humbly to call upon God. In all the Sorrows and Troubles, Dangers and Di&s;tre&s;&s;es we are incident to, in this <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of Sin and Changes, we are &s;till to make GOD our Refuge and Dependence; deeply &s;en&s;ible, that without GOD in vain is the Help of Man; that GOD is the exhau&s;tle&s;s Fountain of all Good, of all Help&mdash;the Father of Mercy and of Lights, from whom cometh down every good and perfect Gift: And in our Sea&s;ons of &s;pecial and imminent Di&s;tre&s;s and Danger, we have a particular Call, to be very fervent and importunate in our Addre&s;&s;es to GOD: And this, I hope, was, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, the Ca&s;e during the Cour&s;e of the late War; and particular|ly at that gloomy Period above-mentioned. Did not the Churches and Congregations of GOD's Peo|ple in <HI>New England</HI>&mdash;did not we in this Colony and in this Town, frequently and cheerfully meet
<PB N="12" REF="009417_0007_0F743B1BBA64D658">
in the Hou&s;e of GOD, to offer up our Supplications, and pour out our Prayers before the Mercy-Seat, for Protection and Safety, for Deliverance and Salvation? How did you then &s;eem to be &s;truck with a Convicti|on and Sen&s;e, that if GOD did not appear for us, and his own Arm did not bring us Salvation, we were a ruin'd and undone People? How forward did you then &s;eem to be to look above all created Help, to Him that governs the whole World and orders all the Affairs of it as he plea&s;es, and to &s;eek and cry to him for Deliverance? With what Freedom and Earne&s;t|ne&s;s did you croud the Sanctuary of GOD, eager to unite in pouring out your Supplications before his Throne, and to hear In&s;tructions from his Word? You cannot have forgotten, how cheerfully you uni|ted in &s;etting apart Days for Fa&s;ting and Prayer; and Weekly Sea&s;ons, for &s;pecial and &s;olemn Prayer, that GOD would mercifully appear for us and deliver us. And I hope a Conviction is left upon <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Hearts, that He is a Prayer-Hearing GOD, and that it is not a vain Thing to &s;eek and pray to Him.</P>
<P>And tho' we have Rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, that many Per&s;ons did not pray, with &s;uch a Sen&s;e of their own Unworthine&s;s and evil De&s;erts, and the Power and Wi&s;dom, Grace and Mercy and All-&s;ufficien|cy of GOD, and &s;uch a Dependence on his Power and Grace through CHRIST, as they ought; yet, no Doubt, many Others were graciou&s;ly &s;incere and cordial in their Addre&s;&s;es to GOD. And I have thought and &s;till think, that a Spirit of Prayer and Supplication, in &s;ome thing of an uncommon De|gree, was poured out on GOD's People in the Land: And when GOD gives an Heart to pray, He is
<PB N="13" REF="009417_0007_0F743B1BBA64D658">
wont to find an Ear to hear. And did he not hear? Did he not hearken to the Voice of our Supplications, and &s;end us an An&s;wer of Peace? Did he not hearken to the Voice of Men, &s;inful, guilty Men? And in An&s;wer to the Supplications of his People, did he not make bare his own Arm, and work Deliverance and Salvation for us? Yes, He is a Prayer-hearing GOD, and has never &s;aid to the Seed of <HI>Jacob,</HI> &s;eek ye my Face in vain. And &s;o I am led to &s;ay,</P>
<P>III. <HI>God has delivered us.</HI> "Call upon me, in the Day of Trouble; I will deliver thee." Yes, GOD has delivered us, with a Salvation never to be forgotten.</P>
<P>GOD might ju&s;tly, provoked by our Sins, have given us up a Prey, into the Hands of tho&s;e that hated us; and doom'd us to a State of di&s;mal Sla|very, under <HI>Gallic</HI> Chains and <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Super&s;tition and Tyranny: But of his rich and abundant Grace he has delivered us. After a Period of Darkne&s;s and Perplexity; the Darkne&s;s vani&s;hed, the Clouds &s;cattered, and the Day dawn'd. "GOD'S right Hand, and his holy Arm, and the Light of his Countenance, have brought us Salvation, becau&s;e he had a Favour for us." Suddenly the Scene changed, and our Covenant GOD, who &s;eemed in a Manner to have ca&s;t us off, appeared for us, in our Di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>He was plea&s;ed to rai&s;e up tho&s;e, whom he de|lighted to honor, as the cho&s;en In&s;truments of our Deliverance. In this Connection, the <HI>Patriot Pitt</HI> will not be forgotten. Unity and Harmony were re&s;tored to our public Coun&s;els. The Briti&s;h Lion
<PB N="14" REF="009417_0008_0F743B1C817A5B60">
arou&s;ed as from a Sleep. A martial Spirit and Fire was diffu&s;ed and &s;pread into our Fleets and Armies. Expeditions were form'd and plan'd with Wi&s;dom and Con&s;i&s;tency; and carried into Execution with Firmne&s;s and Steadine&s;s; and a Spirit and Re&s;olu|tion that Nothing could daunt or re&s;i&s;t. The guilty, ambitious Schemes of <HI>France</HI> vani&s;hed like a Dream of the Night: Our Enemies fled before us in every Climate: Our Fleets and Armies went on from conquering to conquer. The <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Troops triumphed in every Quarter of the World: <HI>Europe, A&s;ia, Africa</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> beheld with Wonder our Succe&s;s and Victories.</P>
<P>It would be be&s;ide my pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e, to enu|merate the great Things GOD has done in <HI>Africa,</HI> the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> and <HI>Germany.</HI> Let me briefly men|tion a few In&s;tances nearer Home. <HI>Cape-Breton, Crown-Point, Quebec, Montreal,</HI> yea, the whole <HI>French</HI> Territory, almo&s;t, in <HI>North-America,</HI> wre&s;ted from them, was given into our Hands: Be&s;ides <HI>Guadaloupe, Martinic<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> &amp;c. in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies;</HI> and the <HI>Havana</HI> from the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> The <HI>Spaniards!</HI> what a wretched, de&s;picable Figure will they make, in the future Hi&s;tory of the&s;e Times! And what crowns all, the War is at Length terminated in a de&s;irable and happy Peace. The di&s;mal Calamities of War, which had over&s;pread the &s;everal Quarters of the Earth, are at an End. The Supreme Ru|ler, who &s;ays to the proud Waves of the Sea, "
"Hi|therto &s;hall ye go and no further," and who over|rules the Hearts of Men, has diffu&s;ed a Spirit of Union and Harmony among the &s;everal contending Powers, and mercifully brought on a general Paci|fication

&mdash;a Peace, by which we have acquired a mighty Enlargement of Dominion and Territory, and many Advantages&mdash;a Peace peculiarly favour|able and advantageous to us, in <HI>America;</HI> even beyond our mo&s;t &s;anguine Expectations, when the War fir&s;t opened. The&s;e are the LORD'S Doings, and ju&s;tly marvellous in our Eyes. Many and &s;trik|ing are the Demon&s;trations of a divine Interpo&s;ition, and of the Goodne&s;s and Power of GOD exerted in our Behalf.</P>
<P>Who commanded the Winds and the Seas, and ordered the Sea&s;ons, from Time to Time &s;o mer|cifully? Who commanded the Earth to yield her Increa&s;e, and furni&s;hed Re&s;ources &s;ufficient to car|ry on &s;o many Expeditions, in &s;o many different Parts of the World, at the &s;ame Time? Who &s;pi|rited the Soldiery to offer them&s;elves, and armed them with Patience, Re&s;olution and Courage? Who in&s;pired our worthy Commanders, by Sea and Land, with Wi&s;dom, Prudence and Magnanimity, &s;o proportioned to their elevated and important Stations? Permit me to &s;ay, on this Occa&s;ion; Who rai&s;ed up the late intrepid, heroic Leader, the gal|lant <HI>Wolf;</HI> and furni&s;hed him with Talents, to &s;o uncommon a Degree, for the important Province he was called to? Who gave him an Head to Plan, and an Arm to execute the mighty De&s;ign, his Heart was &s;o much &s;et upon? To execute it in a Manner, that extorted the Admiration and A&s;ton|i&s;hment of his very Enemies? Who animated the Nation and it's public Councils with &s;uch a Spirit of Union and Harmony, to pro&s;ecute the War with Vigor, according to the Mea&s;ures &s;o wi&s;ely

concerted? Finally, Who excited and animated &s;o many of GOD's profe&s;&s;ing People, in this Land, and we tru&s;t al&s;o in our Mother Country, to pour out frequent and &s;ervent Prayers at the Mercy Seat, for the Smiles of Heaven on our military Operati|ons? Doubtle&s;s, GOD is to be acknowledged and adored in all the&s;e Things. Yes, you may &s;ay; "The &s;uperintending and directing Providence of the Mo&s;t High extends to all Events, and without Him not a Sparrow falls to the Ground; for GOD governs the whole World." He does &s;o: But then in &s;ome of GOD's Works, there &s;eems to be more evident and &s;triking Marks of a divine Superinten|dency and Conduct; and the Foot&s;teps of Deity are more plainly vi&s;ible: And here the Re&s;ults of Battles, and the Events of War are to be ranked. The&s;e depend on &s;o many fickle Uncertainties as to us, and &s;o many Things that are evidently beyond the Reach of human Power, as to render the Hand of GOD the more con&s;picuous. When the Wind and the Weather, the various Elements and an un|common Co-incidence of Circum&s;tances, have con|&s;pired to favour our Enterprizes: When an Un|jarring Harmony has &s;ub&s;i&s;ted among all Orders of Men concern'd: When they have all united in one View, in one grand De&s;ign: When a martial, he|roic Ardor &s;eem'd to glow in every Brea&s;t: When, though to a common Penetration, the Difficulties attending the mo&s;t important and deci&s;ive Conque&s;t, that of <HI>Quebec,</HI> and which was a Key to the Re&s;t, &s;eemed in&s;uparable; yet the di&s;tingui&s;h'd Leader,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">WOLF.</NOTE> by a Sagacity lent him from Above, di&s;cern'd the

And when GOD has been plea&s;ed to vouch&s;afe a remarkable Series, an unbro|ken Chain of numerous Victories; what pious Mind can contemplate the important Events, without owning and adoring the Hand of Heaven?&mdash;with|out being &s;truck with a kind of Sacred Reverence of the Pre&s;ence of GOD; and his glorious Perfecti|ons, his Power, Wi&s;dom, Goodne&s;s and Mercy &s;o evidently con&s;picuous therein.</P>
<P>But that we may be the more &s;en&s;ible of the Goodne&s;s of GOD, and our Indebtedne&s;s to Him, for our late Succe&s;&s;es, and pre&s;ent happy Settlement; it may be proper to take Notice of one or two Things, which plainly determine it a great Deli|verance.</P>

By the Chain of Forts they had carried round us, and the Air, and Manner of their Operations, what le&s;s could they de&s;ign, than our utter Ruin, and the wre&s;ting from us this goodly Heritage GOD gave to our Fathers?. And can we imagine to our&s;elves the execution of &s;uch their De&s;ign without Amazement and Horror?&mdash;Their Popi&s;h and Pagan Armies marching into the Heart of our Country, practi&s;ing their imhuman Cruelties without Pity?&mdash;Without Di&s;tinction, butchering Men, Women and Children, in their triumphant Progre&s;s; involving our Habitations, Churches and Towns in devouring Flames; and deluging the Land with Slaughter and Blood; whil&s;t the mi&s;erable Remnant, &s;tript of all their precious Privileges, Civil and Religious, would be reduced to a State of the mo&s;t wretched Slavery. How di&s;|mal were &s;uch a State of Things! But GOD in great Mercy has prevented it.</P>
<P>The Pit they were digging for us, they are fallen into them&s;elves: And the Mi&s;chief they were fram|ing for us, GOD has brought down upon their own Heads: Their ambitious, towering Scheme, is da&s;hed to Pieces; and their whole <HI>American</HI> Ter|ritory almo&s;t, is given up; and by the pre&s;ent Settlement annexed to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Crown. So won|derfully has GOD delivered us.</P>
<P>Let us con&s;ider, <HI>nextly,</HI> the Worth and Value of the&s;e Acqui&s;itions, thus &s;ecur'd to us; and the Evils
<PB N="19" REF="009417_0010_0F743B1E26E7C338">
we are like to be &s;ecur'd again&s;t, for the Time to come. 'Tis not ea&s;y to a&s;certain their Importance and value to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Crown, and to the&s;e Pro|vinces: They are, without Doubt, va&s;tly valuable. The Conque&s;t of all <HI>France,</HI> I imagine, would not have been equally &s;o: For in that Ca&s;e, it would be immen&s;ely chargeable to keep it; and in the End, perhaps <HI>Britain</HI> would become a Province of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>In &s;undry Views, the Reduction of <HI>Canada,</HI> is ju&s;tly accounted a very important Acqui&s;ition. It directly conduces to the future Security and Peace of the&s;e Colonies. What a bloody Scourge have the <HI>French</HI> Settlements in <HI>Canada</HI> been to the&s;e Pro|vinces, from Generation to Generation? What horrid and inhuman Butcheries have been perpe|trated? How much <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Blood has been &s;hed upon our Frontiers, by the blood-thir&s;ty <HI>Savages,</HI> &s;pirited and &s;et on by the faithle&s;s <HI>French?</HI> But the&s;e horrid Butcheries are, we hope, likely to be forever over and at an End.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The pre&s;ent in human and cruel Out-breakings of the Sa|vages, we tru&s;t, will be of no long Continuance&mdash;that proper Mea&s;ures will be concerted, for their being &s;peedily and ef|fectually &s;uppre&s;s'd.</NOTE></P>
<P>Be&s;ides, what an immen&s;e Source of Wealth may this Acqui&s;ition prove; as it opens a mo&s;t va|luable Trade with the Natives, for a va&s;t Extent of Territory round.&mdash;But to wave this, and pa&s;s to take in another Point of View, a very intere&s;ting and glorious one to a Chri&s;tian. May we not hope, that the&s;e Events will &s;erve to give the Savages &s;ome Impre&s;&s;ions in Favour of the Go&s;pel, the pure
<PB N="20" REF="009417_0011_0F743B20B1AB4948">
Go&s;pel, unadulterated with <HI>popi&s;h</HI> Mixtures. Will not the Natives, after having con&s;idered and weigh|ed the&s;e Things, be naturally led to &s;ay, as the <HI>Heathen</HI> did, with Regard to <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> in P&s;alm cxxvi. 2. "Then &s;aid they among the Heathen, the Lord hath done great Things for them." "The GOD of <HI>Britons</HI> and of <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> has done great Things for them: He is a great GOD, and a mighty King." And may we not hope, that their Minds may thence receive &s;ome powerful Touch in Favour of the Ble&s;&s;ed Go&s;pel: And that a Way may be opened for the &s;preading the glorious Go&s;pel among them; and their being brought to a profe&s;&s;ed and cordial Subjection to the Prince of Peace: That &s;o, in the&s;e dark Corners of the Earth, where Satan's Seat from Time immemorial has been, the Churches of CHRIST may be erected, and his Go&s;pel and Reli|gion taught; and Multitudes of Souls train'd up for the Kingdom of Heaven. What a ble&s;&s;ed, glo|rious Event would this be, if CHRIST the King of <HI>Zion</HI> &s;hould then take to him&s;elf his great Power and Reign! But I need &s;ay Nothing further, to give you an Impre&s;&s;ion of the Greatne&s;s of the De|liverance and Salvation mercifully granted us of GOD. "The LORD is our Strength, and he is become our Salvation." Our Covenant GOD, and the GOD of our Fathers has done this; the GOD that brought our Fathers into this Land, and planted them here; who watched over them in the Days of their &s;mall Things; who planted his Church here, and &s;till defends and cheri&s;hes that Vine which his own right Hand had planted. 'Tis He that has fought our Battles for us, and
<PB N="21" REF="009417_0011_0F743B20B1AB4948">
triumphed gloriou&s;ly. 'Tis He that has carried us on from Victory to Victory, to the pre&s;ent hap|py Settlement. Let a Sen&s;e of this ever be found warm at our Hearts, and let us feel the Obligati|ons we are under of Love and Homage, of Gra|titude, Thank&s;giving and Prai&s;e to the GOD of all our Salvations. Wherefore,</P>
<P>IV. <HI>Let us offer unto God Thank&s;giving, and prai&s;e his Name.</HI> This is the Duty we are now call'd to: Let us &s;ee to it, it be done aright. Our Hearts &s;hould be impre&s;s'd with a deep Sen&s;e of the good|ne&s;s and &s;alvation of GOD; and they &s;hould act and flow out in the warme&s;t and mo&s;t cordial Gra|titude to the Supreme Ruler, and our Cele&s;tial Be|nefactor. To engage us to the acceptable Di&s;charge of this Duty, let us con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>This is a mo&s;t fit and rea&s;onable Thing.</HI> 'Tis our treating GOD and acting towards Him, as being what he is; infinitely the be&s;t of Beings, and the glorious Source and Spring of all our Salvations. When we &s;incerely a&s;cribe our public Succe&s;&s;es, our Victories and Triumphs, and in Con&s;equence of the&s;e, our pre&s;ent Settlement, to GOD; we a&s;cribe them to their true Source and Original. And this, to|gether with corre&s;pondent Gratitude and Thank&s;|giving to the Mo&s;t High, is mo&s;t rea&s;onable, fit and right; for unto GOD the Honor and Prai&s;e do belong.</P>
<P>Men can claim no other Honor from &s;uch E|vents, than what belongs to moral In&s;truments, the Honor of having faithfully employed their di&s;|tingui&s;hed Talents for the Good of Mankind. In this View, our wi&s;e Coun&s;ellors and Politicians,
<PB N="22" REF="009417_0012_0F743B217667FE68">
our heroic Chiefs and Commanders, and our brave Soldiers too, ju&s;tly come in for their Share of Prai&s;e. A Tribute of Honor and Prai&s;e is due to them from a pre&s;erved and grateful Country. But as they were rai&s;ed up by GOD, and furni&s;hed with their various Talents, and &s;pirited and call'd forth to the Exertion of them, for the Welfare and Salvation of their Country, by GOD; &s;o the Prai&s;e and Glo|ry are ultimately due to him. Ble&s;s the LORD, O our Souls, and all that is within us, prai&s;e his ho|ly Name: This is rea&s;onable, fit and right.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>This is delightful to &s;erious and pious Minds.</HI> True Devotion is the mo&s;t noble and delightful Exerci&s;e of a rea&s;onable Creature. A fixed and governing Habit of Devotion, is the true&s;t Ornament and Glory of a Man: And &s;incere Gratitude and Thank&s;|giving is the mo&s;t animating Part of Devotion: It warms and exalts the Soul, with noble and affecting Conceptions of the Atributes of the De|ity, di&s;play'd for the Good of Mankind. And when whole Countries and Kingdoms are relieved and made happy, the more elevated and delightful mu&s;t be the Views of the pious and devout, of the Goodne&s;s and Mercy, the Wi&s;dom and Power of GOD; whence all their public Salvations re&s;ult. I might add here, this Branch of Devotion is no le&s;s honorable to GOD, than it is delightful to good Men. GOD him&s;elf takes Plea&s;ure in &s;eeing his rea&s;onable Creatures rejoicing in his Goodne&s;s, and in Him&s;elf the Author of all their Salvation: Yes, it is honorable and plea&s;ing to the mo&s;t high GOD, to &s;ee whole Provinces and Kingdoms kneeling before him, and &s;incerely a&s;cribing the Prai&s;e and
<PB N="23" REF="009417_0012_0F743B217667FE68">
Glory of all their public Salvations and Ble&s;&s;ings to Him. Permit me then to &s;ay, as the <HI>Levites</HI> did to the Congregation of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> on another Occa&s;ion, "Stand up and ble&s;s the LORD your GOD forever and ever, and ble&s;&s;ed be thy glorious Name, which is exalted above all Ble&s;&s;ing and Prai&s;e." Nehem. ix. 5.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Sincere and Heart-felt Gratitude, on this Occa&s;i|on, has a Tendency to make us, as a People, more vir|tuous and religious.</HI> It tends to meliorate the Heart, and make the Life better. True Devotion con|duces to improve and &s;trengthen, in the Heart, every Principle of Virtue and Holine&s;s. A reve|rent and grateful Sen&s;e of GOD and his Goodne&s;s, prevailing in the Heart, naturally di&s;covers it&s;elf in a Care and Endeavour to plea&s;e and honor Him. A due Sen&s;e of the Loving kindne&s;s and Mercy of the LORD, tends to melt and fill the Heart with a Sen&s;e of our own Unworthine&s;s, and to prompt us, from a Principle of Gratitude, to plea&s;e and &s;erve the GOD of all our Salvations: So that our public Solemnities of Thank&s;giving and Prai&s;e, if rightly attended, tend to diffu&s;e and &s;pread a Spirit of Devotion and Piety through the Land, and to animate and &s;tir up People to lead Lives of Holi|ne&s;s and Obedience&mdash;to make us a better People, more virtuous, holy and religious, more careful to maintain good Works, and to do what&s;oever GOD has commanded us. Let us then, with all our Hearts, offer unto GOD Thank&s;giving and ble&s;s his holy Name. And &s;o I am prepared to &s;ay,</P>
<P>V. <HI>We are to pay our Vows to the Mo&s;t High.</HI> "Of|fer unto GOD Thank&s;giving, and pay thy Vows
<PB N="24" REF="009417_0013_0F743B21C8790970">
unto the Mo&s;t High." We are, in &s;undry Views, under &s;tronge&s;t Obligations to make &s;uitable Re|turns to GOD, for all his Goodne&s;s and Mercy.</P>
<P>Shall I call to your Remembrance, this Day, our &s;olemn Tran&s;actions with GOD, in that gloomy Sea&s;on, pre&s;ently after Fort <HI>William-Henry</HI> was ta|ken and de&s;troyed by the <HI>French;</HI> and the A&s;pects of Providence &s;eemed &s;o very dark and threatning; when we thought it our Duty, to &s;et apart a Day for &s;olemn Humiliation and Prayer before GOD: You may perhaps remember, the Words treated on, on that Occa&s;ion, were tho&s;e in <HI>Judges</HI> x. 15. "We have &s;inned, do thou unto us what&s;oever &s;eemeth good unto thee, deliver us only, we pray thee this Day." Were you not ready, in that Sea&s;on of Di&s;|tre&s;s, to fall down before GOD; and in the Bitter|ne&s;s of your Souls to confe&s;s your Sin, your Guilt and evil De&s;erts; and to implore Protection and Deliverance, on what Terms GOD plea&s;ed? "De|liver us only this Day from our Enemies, and pu|ni&s;h us in what other Way thou wilt for our Sins: Send Sickne&s;s, &s;end Pe&s;tilence, &s;end Bla&s;ting and Fa|mine if thou wilt; let us fall into the Hands of the living GOD, and not into the Hands of unrea&s;ona|ble Men; not into the Hands of our cruel and bloody Enemies." Were you not ready to pro&s;|trate your&s;elves before the Mercy-Seat, and &s;eriou&s;ly to promi&s;e and vow to the Mo&s;t High, and Cove|nant with Him, that if He would deliver and &s;ave you, you would be his faithful Servants forever; would devote your&s;elves wholly to Him, to walk before Him and to keep his Commandments all the Days of your Lives: And if you did not
<PB N="25" REF="009417_0013_0F743B21C8790970">
do &s;o, were ready to own, you &s;hould be the mo&s;t guilty and inexcu&s;able Creatures imaginable. Well, GOD did appear for us and deliver us: He has &s;a|ved us with a mighty Salvation; carried us with Succe&s;s and Victory, thro' the War, and brought us to this happy Period of it: Now then we mu&s;t pay our Vows to the Mo&s;t High&mdash;our Vows of Gratitude and Love, of Homage and &s;incere Obe|dience. The devout <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> &s;ays in P&s;alm lxvi. 13, 14. "I will go into thy Hou&s;e with Burnt Offer|ings: And will pay thee my Vows, which my Lips have uttered, and my Mouth hath &s;poken, when I was in Trouble."</P>
<P>We are not to forget our &s;olemn Tran&s;actions with GOD in Years pa&s;t; but mu&s;t &s;till hold them in Remembrance; and render unto GOD according to all the Benefits we have receiv'd. But, whether we formally and explicitly made Vows and Pro|mi&s;es to GOD, in the Sea&s;on of our Di&s;tre&s;s, or not; was not &s;omething like this implied, in the Solemn Prayers and Supplications we pour'd out in GOD's Hou&s;e, from Time to Time?&mdash;And I may add, I hope, in our Families and in our Clo|&s;ets too? What was the Import and Meaning of tho&s;e Prayers? Was it not plainly implied, in all that Variety of Phra&s;e and Expre&s;&s;ion, that might be made U&s;e of from Time to Time?&mdash;That we humbly beg'd Deliverance, Succe&s;s in the War, and a final happy Settlement and Peace, at the Hand of GOD; &s;en&s;ible that GOD only could be|&s;tow the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings; that if He &s;hould be plea&s;ed to be&s;tow them, it would be all Mercy, rich un|merited Mercy and Grace; and that it &s;hould be
<PB N="26" REF="009417_0014_0F743B2272DB39E0">
regarded, re&s;ented and improved by us as &s;uch; and we &s;hould hold our&s;elves bound and obliged to make all proper Returns to the GOD of all our Salvations? The&s;e then are the Returns we are now bound to make, to ble&s;s and prai&s;e the Name of GOD; and to expre&s;s our Gratitude by Lives of Holine&s;s and New Obedience.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, we may by no Means forget, that as we are the profe&s;&s;ing People of GOD, we are under Covenant Obligations, to walk with GOD according to his Word; and to make a right U&s;e and Im|provement not only of his Word and Ordinances, but likewi&s;e of all the Di&s;pen&s;ations of his Pro|vidence. Yes, we are under &s;olemn covenant Ob|ligations to improve the Salvation and Mercy we now celebrate, &s;o as to be induced thence to con&s;e|crate our&s;elves, all our Powers and Faculties, our Time and Talents to GOD, to his Service and Glo|ry. O let us not fail, on this Occa&s;ion, to an&s;wer the Obligations, we are under to GOD; and with glad and devout Hearts, to pay our Vows to the Mo&s;t High. I mu&s;t add in the</P>
<P>VI. Place, <HI>We mu&s;t now glorify GOD.</HI> "I will deliver thee, and thou &s;halt glorify me." No Crea|ture can glorify GOD, by making any Addition to his e&s;&s;ential Glory; or by making GOD any more glorious than he really is. It is beyond the Reach or Capacity of Men or Angels, to make GOD any more really Glorious than he always was, and al|ways will be; for he is infinitely perfect, infinitely glorious, independently of all Creatures: But we glorify GOD, declaratively or manife&s;tively, when we manife&s;t or &s;hew forth his Glory: When we
<PB N="27" REF="009417_0014_0F743B2272DB39E0">
think, &s;peak, act and live &s;o as &s;peaks and declares GOD to be glorious: Particularly,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>We are to glorify GOD, by entertaining high and honorable Tho'ts of Him.</HI> We mu&s;t remove from our Apprehen&s;ions of GOD, every Thing that implies Imperfection; and conceive of Him, as a Being of infinite Perfection and Glory. All po&s;&s;ible, in|finite Perfections and Excellencies mu&s;t meet in our Idea of GOD: And we mu&s;t conceive of Him, as the fir&s;t and infinitely the greate&s;t and be&s;t of Be|ings. We think honorably of GOD, when we re|ally think and conceive of Him to be, what he re|ally is, infinitely glorious. Particularly, we mu&s;t entertain very high and admiring Thoughts of tho&s;e Perfections of the Deity, his Wi&s;dom, Power, Co|venant Faithfulne&s;s, his Pity and Compa&s;&s;ion, his Goodne&s;s, Grace and Mercy, that have been emi|nently di&s;played in working Salvation for us.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>We are to glorify GOD by proper and &s;uitable Affec|tions and Actings of Soul towards Him.</HI> By heartily believing the Revelations He has made of Him&s;elf in his Word; by reverencing the Operations of his Hand, in his Works of Providence; by tru&s;t|ing in Him, through the Mediator, for all the Ble&s;&s;ings of Time and Eternity; by loving GOD, the be&s;t of Beings, with all our Hearts and with all our Souls; and by being effectually induc'd by all that Goodne&s;s and Mercy, in which he has pa&s;|&s;ed before us, to take up our complacential ever|la&s;ting Re&s;t in GOD, to delight our&s;elves in Him, as our Portion, and the Object of our Supreme Felicity. In a Word, every grateful and devout Temper of Mind, &s;uitable and adapted to the great
<PB N="28" REF="009417_0015_0F743B23429A5220">
Things GOD has done for us, &s;hould be call'd forth into flouri&s;hing Exerci&s;e, to the Honor and Glory of GOD.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>We mu&s;t glorify GOD, by &s;peaking reverently and honorably of Him and to Him.</HI> It is infinite Conde&s;cen|tion in the great GOD, to let Him&s;elf down to us: And it becomes us to take his Sacred Name into our Lips, with greate&s;t Humility and Reverence: E&s;|pecially on this Occa&s;ion does it become us, to pour out through our Lips, the warme&s;t Gratitude of our Hearts to the Father of Mercy, and our great Deliverer and Benefactor, and by offering Prai&s;e and Thank&s;giving to glorify Him.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>We are to glorify GOD, by Lives devoted to Him.</HI> "By adorning the Doctrine of GOD our Saviour in all Things; and making our Light &s;hine be-Men that &s;eeing our good Works, they may glo|rify our Father which is in Heaven." By wor&s;hip|ing and &s;erving GOD according to his Appoint|ment: By practi&s;ing Ju&s;tice, Love and Charity to our Fellow-Men; and by Humility, Meekne&s;s and Purity in all our Behaviour. We are to glorify GOD, by improving our Time and Talents well; and by bringing forth Fruit, in Proportion to the Means and Advantages we enjoy. In a Word, we are to glorify GOD, by living and conducting our|&s;elves in &s;uch a Manner, that the natural and ge|nuine Language of the whole Tenor of our Con|duct and Deportment may be, that GOD is &s;uch an infinitely glorious Being, as he has revealed Him|&s;elf to be in His Word. Let us now make &s;ome IMPROVEMENT of this Subject. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Let us &s;eriou&s;ly enquire, how we have been affected
<PB N="29" REF="009417_0015_0F743B23429A5220">
and influenced, in Heart and Life, by all God's various Dealings with us, in the Cour&s;e of his Providence, from the Time when the late War opened to the pre&s;ent Day? And be per&s;uaded, in Obedience to the pre&s;ent Call of divine Goodne&s;s and Mercy, &s;peedily to reform and amend what|&s;oever is &s;till to be found ami&s;s in us, or among us.</HI> GOD has been pa&s;&s;ing before us of late Years, by terrible Things in Righteou&s;ne&s;s: He has likewi&s;e cau&s;ed his Goodne&s;s and Mercy, in remarkable, wonder|ful In&s;tances of it, to pa&s;s before us: And by all, He has been calling upon us, loudly and long cal|ling upon us; to con&s;ider, to repent, to reform and turn to GOD and our Duty. And what Influence have all GOD's Calls, and all the Means He has been u&s;ing with us, had to effect and bring about a Reformation? Are we, in Con&s;equence of all, become a reformed, and truly religious People? Are we in any Mea&s;ure&mdash;in any con&s;iderable Mea|&s;ure reformed? Some particular Per&s;ons, I doubt not, have repented and turned to GOD; it would be &s;ad indeed if none had: But has there been any Thing like a general Reformation effected, by all GOD has been doing with us&punc; Is there not as much&mdash;is there not more Sin in the Land, than when the War began? What one Sin is generally bro|ken off and for&s;aken? Truly, I fear, not &s;o much as one. Are we more pious, godly and devout than we u&s;ed to be? Do we prize God's Word, Day and Ordinances more? Are we more &s;trict and exemplary in all the Branches of Piety, than formerly? Are we more ju&s;t, kind, charatable, peaceful and forgiving, with Regard to Men? Has a Reformation been carried on in our Families? Is
<PB N="30" REF="009417_0016_0F743B23F8EC24C0">
Family Religion reviv'd among us? In a Word, Do we live and conduct our&s;elves more, as it be|comes the Di&s;ciples and Followers of the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, than we u&s;ed to do? I much fear, but lit|tle of this can be an&s;wered in the Affirmative: 'Tis too plain we are yet a &s;inful People; and there are many dark and threatning Symptoms upon us. Let us, without Delay, take our Ca&s;e into &s;erious Con&s;ideration, and receive Conviction of the Ne|ce&s;&s;ity we are under, of a thorough Reformation. If GOD'S awful Rod has not driven you; let his great Goodne&s;s and Mercy lead you to Repentance: And do not, after your Hardne&s;s and impenitent Hearts, trea&s;ure up to your&s;elves Wrath again&s;t the Day of Wrath, and the Revelation of the righ|teous Judgments of GOD. It is a dreadful Thing to remain hardened and impenitent under all GOD'S various Dealings with you, for your Reformation. O be per&s;uaded to break off every known Sin, and to turn, with all your Hearts, to GOD in CHRIST; and enter, without Delay upon a Life of &s;trict Re|ligion and real Godline&s;s. Let a grateful Sen&s;e of the unmerited Goodne&s;s of God, effectually engage you, to make all proper and &s;uitable Returns to Him, and to live to the Prai&s;e and Glory of the GOD of all your Salvations.</P>

to &s;uch Things, as tend to render us a hap|py and flouri&s;hing People. The political Precauti|ons that may be proper at this Juncture, being out of my Province, I leave to tho&s;e, who have the Conduct and Management of our public Af|fairs: But the improvement and Cultivation of moral Di&s;po&s;itions and &s;ocial Virtues, mu&s;t always be proper to be recommended from this Place. If we con&s;ider, how much we are exhau&s;ted, by the Length and Expen&s;ivene&s;s of the War;&mdash;how bur|dened with Debts, and how many Individuals in the Colony are &s;unk, or &s;inking apace under the Burden: It &s;eems proper to call to Mind, the Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of checking and di&s;couraging, a Spirit of Prodigality and Expen&s;ive Vanity; which in the natural Train of Things tend to &s;ink us into Po|verty and Di&s;grace: And of promoting and culti|vating Tranquility, Prudence and Indu&s;try, and a Method of living according to our Station and A|bility: This would have a happy Tendency to ren|der us a flouri&s;hing People.

any Thing more directly and effectually conduces to the Strength, Firmne&s;s and Pro&s;perity of a State or People, than a Public Spirit, and a generous Regard to the Good of the Whole; and a Sub|ordinating our private Views and Intere&s;t to the Welfare of the Public: A Sen&s;e of this &s;hould be fixed deep in our Hearts. Permit me al&s;o to re|mind you, on this Occa&s;ion, of how great Impor|tance it is to the Welfare of the Community, that a wi&s;e and diligent Care be taken of the Education of Youth; that they be trained up in the Way, in which they ought to go; that &s;o they may become Worthy Members, not only of the Churches of CHRIST, but of the Civil State. They &s;hould be form'd betimes to a Veneration and Reverence for Laws, both Human and Divine; and for all law|ful Authority in Family, in Church and State&mdash;to Indu&s;try, Diligence and Frugality; to every &s;oci|al and amiable Virtue; and to every Temper and Practice that tend to render them Ble&s;&s;ings in the World: That &s;o, when their Fathers fall a&s;leep, a Generation may ari&s;e, who &s;hall &s;hine as Lights in the World, and mark their Way through Life with worthy and laudable Actions, to another and bet|ter World.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Let us be per&s;uaded, from the Occa&s;ion of the pre|&s;ent Solemnity, to look forward with Hope and Joy and Tru&s;t in God, to that State of Purity and Peace, the Church of Chri&s;t expects in the latter Day; and to the complete and endle&s;s Purity and Peace of the Heavenly World.</HI> 'Tis painful to a pious and benevolent Mind to con|&s;ider the Mi&s;eries and Calamities Mankind have groan|ed under, from Generation to Generation, ever &s;ince

the Entrance of Sin into the World. Bloody Wars and Deva&s;tations, and Mankind pur&s;uing and de|vouring one another like Bea&s;ts of Prey; make up a great Part of the Hi&s;tory of pa&s;t Ages: And whence come Wars and Fightings upon the Earth? They come from the Ambition and Lu&s;ts of Men: And will the Ambition and Lu&s;ts of Men always prevail to &s;uch a Degree, as to drive Peace in a Manner, from the Earth; and render this lower World a Stage of Calamity and Mi&s;ery, an Acel|dama, a Field of Blood? Will Satan, the god of this World, always prevail, to lead ignorant, &s;tupid Mankind captive to their Ruin; and, as it were, go off the Stage victorious? This can hardly be thought: No, the Prince of Peace, is the Lion of the Tribe of Judah: He has brui&s;ed the Serpent's Head; and led Captivity captive: And He will a&s;&s;ert the Conque&s;t He has gained over the Powers of Darkne&s;s: He mu&s;t reign and triumph; and His Cau&s;e will finally prevail: His Kingdom of Truth and Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Peace, will be glori|ou&s;ly &s;et up, on the Ruins of Satan's Kingdom. A Period, a long and happy Period of a Thou&s;and Years, is ju&s;tly expected; when Satan &s;hall be bound, and the Go&s;pel of CHRIST &s;hall be univer&s;ally &s;pread over all the Nations of the Earth; and the Earth &s;hall be full of the Knowledge of the LORD, as the Waters cover the Sea; and Mankind in general through the Earth, in &s;ome good Degree, &s;hall be conform'd in Heart and Life, to the Go&s;pel and Temper of JESUS: The glorious Go&s;pel will pow|erfully prevail, to the di&s;arming their fierce Pa&s;&s;i|ons; regulating their exorbitant De&s;ires, and in|&s;piring

the mo&s;t kindly and benevolent Sentiments: Hence, once for all, they will beat their Swords into Plow Shares, and their Spears into Pruning Hooks; and they will learn War no more: But Mankind, being united in the Sacred Bands of the Go&s;pel Charity, will dwell together in Love, in Peace and undi&s;turb'd Tranquility. This ble&s;&s;ed Period, 'tis probable, will not come on, till we are dead and forgotten in the Earth: Yet ought we not, by Faith in the Word of GOD, to look forward to that Day, with Plea&s;ure and Joy; and earne&s;tly breathe after that Purity and Holine&s;s, that Peace and Joy, which will then ble&s;s the Earth. But e&s;|pecially does it concern us, to look forward with Faith and Hope and Joy, to the complete and end|le&s;s Peace and Purity of the Heavenly World: Where there will be no Sin, nor Trouble, no War nor Unea&s;ine&s;s; but all will be Purity, Peace and Happine&s;s. This ble&s;&s;ed State, if we are the faith|ful Servants of CHRIST, we may ju&s;tly expect; and it cannot be far off; for Death is ha&s;tening upon us. This is that glorious Re&s;t, which GOD, of his un|bounded Goodne&s;s and Grace, has prepared for all good Men. The Holine&s;s, the Joy and Glory of that World, far exceed our pre&s;ent Thoughts: "Eye hath not &s;een, nor Ear heard, nor have en|tered into the Heart of Man, the Things GOD has prepared for them that love Him." 'Tis of much greater Importance to us, that we diligently pre|pare for that World; than that we attempt to di&s;|cribe it. Let us &s;ee to it, that the Go&s;pel has it's &s;anctifying and &s;aving Influence upon our Hearts and Lives; that we are accepted in the Beloved;

and intitled to the Heavenly Felicity; and that we act and live, as it becomes the Candidates for &s;uch a Kingdom and World; and the Di&s;ciples and Followers of the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS: That we enjoy the &s;olid Evidences of the &s;pecial Love and Favour of GOD, and that Peace of GOD po&s;&s;e&s;s our Hearts, which pa&s;&s;eth Under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>Let it be our Care, to live in Peace; in our Fa|milies, in our Neighbourhood, and with Mankind around us: And that we improve and flouri&s;h, more and more in the divine Life; and grow up by happy and &s;wift Advances to a Me<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ne&s;s for a better World; ardently a&s;piring and breathing after the complete Purity, Re&s;t and Happine&s;s of that State: So when we &s;hall be call'd off from the&s;e Regions of Guilt and Mi&s;ery, of War and Blood|&s;hed; we &s;hall a&s;cend to tho&s;e peaceful, bli&s;sful Realms on High; where no Sin will ever pollute; no Enemy will ever mole&s;t; but all will be Peace and Joy and endle&s;s Tranquility.</P>
