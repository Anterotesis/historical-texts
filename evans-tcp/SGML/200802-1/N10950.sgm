<P>AT a time when the unju&s;t &s;torm of mi|ni&s;terial wrath is di&s;charging it&s;elf, in a cruel and ignominious manner, on the noble, patriotic, brave people of the ancient, loyal, important colony of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, in New-England;&mdash;at a time when all the other colonies in North-America, like the true children of <HI>a free-born family,</HI> are rou&s;ed to &s;ome ju&s;t re&s;entment of &s;uch in&s;ults, on their natural and legal rights, taking each other as by the hand, and uniting by the invincible chains of love, friend&s;hip, and intere&s;t, are determined to

&s;upport this their elder &s;i&s;ter colony, now &s;uffer|ing &s;o gloriou&s;ly in the common cau&s;e, or <HI>&s;ink</HI> together;&mdash;at a time when the alarm is &s;ounding from ea&s;t to we&s;t, over this va&s;t continent of North-America, to arms! to arms!&mdash;in &s;hort, at a time when the minds of <HI>all</HI> are in &s;uch a ferment, that they can be &s;carce compo&s;ed to hear any &s;ubject, but what may have &s;ome re|ference to the pre&s;ent times;&mdash;it is but rea&s;on|able to &s;uppo&s;e, that even the Mini&s;ter of <HI>the Prince of Peace,</HI> who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s for ordinary is neither <HI>war</HI> or <HI>politicks,</HI> in &s;uch a &s;ituation, being member of civil &s;ociety, and intere&s;ted like other men would improve the times, by adopting their public in&s;tructions, to the be&s;t &s;ervice of the people, and not offen&s;ive or di&s;plea&s;ing to God; who&s;e ho|ly word is a ble&s;&s;ed directory in every emergency.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o but rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that every judicious, &s;ober American, being now reduced to the dreadful alternative, either to take up arms, apparently again&s;t that very government, which he was wont to revere, and under which he ex|pected protection for both life and property; or &s;ubmit tamely to the galling yoke of <HI>perpetual &s;lavery</HI>; I &s;ay, it is &s;uppo&s;able, that every &s;uch Chri&s;tian American &s;oldier will be all ear to whole|&s;ome in&s;tructions, relative to his pre&s;ent duty.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="013862_0005_0F9254ACD8D8EE70">We own it is rare for &s;oldiers to a&s;k coun&s;el of Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters; and the more pity&mdash;for they are men and &s;inners, as well as others; but I am not called to addre&s;s <HI>Red-Coats,</HI> but CHRISTIAN <HI>Provincials</HI>; yet ble&s;&s;ed be God, it is not a ca&s;e wholly unprecedented, for even regulars to apply to a Go&s;pel Preacher for direction; we have an in&s;tance in the words of our text.&mdash;<HI>And the &s;oldiers demanded of him, &s;aying, And what &s;hall we do? and he &s;aid unto them, Do violence to no man, neither ac|cu&s;e any fal&s;ly, and be content with your wages.</HI> &mdash;</P>
<P>We here find a very important que&s;tion pro|po&s;ed to a per&s;on, every way qualified to &s;olve it; for the mouth of truth it&s;elf tells us, that of all who were then born of women, there was not a greater prophet than John the Bapti&s;t: Al&s;o, the angel who predicted his birth, &s;aid, that he &s;hould be filled with the Holy Gho&s;t, from his mother's womb. He was therefore de&s;ervedly very popu|lar&mdash;was rai&s;ed for the great purpo&s;e of introdu|cing the Jewi&s;h church to the Saviour of the world; and hence much true go&s;pel light &s;hone round this great Preacher.&mdash;The an&s;wers he gave the que&s;tion, may be depended on to be &s;ufficient and conclu&s;ive.</P>
<P>But let us hear, what does John &s;ay; Does he tell them, to lay down their arms, and throw
<PB N="8" REF="013862_0006_0F9254AEB37B17A8">
them by, as there can be no &s;ort of war lawful; as &s;ome would have us believe! No, no, this is not his an&s;wer; John knew better;&mdash;he knew the pre&s;ent &s;tate of our depraved world would render war in many ca&s;es unavoidable, and even nece&s;&s;ary.&mdash;So that a &s;oldier might &s;erve the end of his being in his place and calling, as well as a plowman or preacher in his.</P>
<P>But then it mu&s;t be a ju&s;t war, conducted in a lawful, righteous manner; for the legality of the action, will never ju&s;tify the illegality of the man|ner of pro&s;ecution.</P>
<P>The &s;oldier mu&s;t do violence to no man&mdash;mu&s;t not accu&s;e any fal&s;ly&mdash;and mu&s;t be content with his wages; leading vices the&s;e, for ordinary, among <HI>regular</HI> troops; but the CHRISTIAN <HI>&s;oldier</HI> mu&s;t guard again&s;t them, from the genuine prin|ciples of true religion, in the heart; and then may hope for heaven, as well from a field of bat|tle, as expiring on his couch in the mid&s;t of peace and tranquility.</P>
<P>I now deduce this doctrine from the text, thus explained&mdash;Doctrine.</P>
<P>That although war is in it&s;elf a very great evil, and one of tho&s;e &s;ore judgments, by which a holy
<PB N="9" REF="013862_0007_0F9254AEE6C1AD38">
God puni&s;hes the world for &s;in, therefore to be deprecated, and avoided as much as po&s;&s;ible; yet is, at times, by rea&s;on of certain circum&s;tances, &s;o unavoidable, that it is our duty to enter into it&mdash;The method I de&s;ign to pur&s;ue, in opening up the doctrine, for improvement, is the fol|lowing:&mdash;
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. Humbly attempt to &s;hew (with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to better judgment) when a war is &s;o unavoid|able and nece&s;&s;ary, that it is our duty to enter into it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. Shew how we &s;hould enter into, and pro&s;ecute even a ju&s;t war.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. Improve the &s;ubject, by the deduction of a few natural inferences from the whole.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>You are &s;en&s;ible, my hearers, that there are &s;ome Chri&s;tian people in the world, and &s;ome of them in the&s;e parts, who merit the regard of the public, by their general character of indu&s;try, inoffen&s;ivene&s;s and &s;obriety; yet do maintain it, as a &s;acred con&s;cientious tenet, not to be di&s;|pen&s;ed with, <HI>not to go to war, or take up arms on any occa&s;ion what&s;oever</HI>; and charity, the leading grace of the Chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem, will lead us to deal ten|derly with &s;uch, as far as we have grounds to be|lieve they are &s;incere in their profe&s;&s;ion: We
<PB N="10" REF="013862_0008_0F9254AF832D4B20">
ought to pity &s;uch for their mi&s;take, and, if po&s;|&s;ible, to convince them; but not by any means to urge them again&s;t their avowed &s;entiments, le&s;t we come under the odious appellation of <HI>per&s;ecutors.</HI></P>
<P>As far as the&s;e &s;ober people make u&s;e of the Bible, to found their principles on, they rely on &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages as the&s;e, Gen. ix, 6. <HI>He that &s;hed|deth man's blood, by man &s;hall his blood be &s;hed</HI>; and Exod. xx, 13. <HI>Thou &s;halt not kill</HI>; and in the New-Te&s;tament, <HI>But I &s;ay unto you, love your enemies;&mdash; if any &s;mite thee on the one cheek turn to him the other al&s;o;&mdash;for all they that take the &s;word &s;hall peri&s;h by the &s;word:</HI> Matth. v.39, 44 and xxvi.52. and hence conclude, though I think fal&s;ly, that all war is unlawful, except the &s;piritual, with our own corruptions, by the &s;word of the &s;pirit, in Chri&s;t's &s;piritual kingdom, which is not of this world, el&s;e would his children fight.</P>
<P>But if I mi&s;take not, the&s;e people regard only &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages of holy &s;cripture, as &s;eem to favour their favourite opinion, let the language of other pa&s;&s;ages be what they will; &mdash;and hence their own imagination is &s;ub&s;tituted in&s;tead of divine reve|lation, &s;o that when people are determined to keep by a &s;entiment, be it right or wrong, there is an end of all di&s;putation. &mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="013862_0009_0F9254B045711100">We readily allow, that it would be happy for us all, if there was no moral or natural evil in the world. But how plau&s;ible &s;oever &s;uch opi|nions may appear, to the weal of &s;ociety, they are rather calculated to the condition of innocent, than depraved nature; which now is, and ever has been &s;uch, &s;ince the fall of our fir&s;t parents, that there is need of &s;ome remedy to curb its evil tendencies, or mankind would &s;carce be able to &s;ub&s;i&s;t in the world; and this our alwi&s;e righte|ous Creator knows; and has therefore &s;et up civil government to keep men from de&s;troying each other: But civil government has no power, if it has not the &s;word, to be a terror to evil-doers, and a prai&s;e to them that do well.&mdash;Hence it will follow, that men are under a nece&s;&s;ity to part with &s;ome of their natural rights, to &s;ecure the re&s;t; they mu&s;t give part of their earnings to &s;uch as are cho&s;en by them&s;elves to rule the whole; and then again, they mu&s;t help the rulers to execute the good and whole&s;ome laws of government, again&s;t their violators. Suppo&s;e, for in&s;tance, a great banditti ri&s;e to re&s;cue murderers; if the&s;e are not quelled, government is overthrown, if the people do not a&s;&s;i&s;t good government, as here then ari&s;es a nece&s;&s;ity to go to war.</P>
<P>And &s;uppo&s;e again, on the other hand, which is very &s;uppo&s;able, that the rulers of the people
<PB N="12" REF="013862_0010_0F9254B107A609D0">
&s;hould give way to the many temptations their high &s;tations will lead them to; to indulge the inclinations of a lu&s;t for ab&s;olute dominion, in|dependent of the people, &s;o that all the barrier of oaths and covenants are broke through, to ef|fect the plan; and the people have no &s;ecurity, for either life or property, but the mere &s;ove|reign plea&s;ure of the ab&s;olute rulers;&mdash;then the people are under a di&s;agreeable, but pre&s;&s;ing ne|ce&s;&s;ity, rather than be cru&s;hed by an iron rod, to re-a&s;certain their own ju&s;t rights; and &s;tand forth all of them to oppo&s;e &s;uch tyranny:&mdash;Here then is another in&s;tance of &s;elf-defence&mdash;in which a war is both unavoidable and nece&s;&s;ary, and there|fore lawful, if &s;elf-pre&s;ervation is lawful; which is the point I &s;hall next, in order, endeavour to prove indi&s;putably, both from the light of nature, and divine revelation; and fir&s;t from the light of nature.</P>
<P>It is certainly evident, wherever we turn our eyes, on any part of the whole creation of GOD, that the principle of &s;elf-love or &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, or the de&s;ire of exi&s;tence, is deeply engraved on the nature of every creature. And when this great fir&s;t principle is ob&s;erved, it is, and mu&s;t be agreeable to God, as he will love his own work; and &s;o al&s;o, the neglect of the exerci&s;e of this principle, cannot but di&s;plea&s;e him, as it is un|natural
<PB N="13" REF="013862_0011_0F9254B1B8E19988">
and mon&s;trous. Thus the generous vine will extend her arms, to lay hold on the fir&s;t neighbouring prop, and with her little tender tendants, twine around it, to pre&s;erve her clu&s;ters from peri&s;hing on the cold ground.</P>
<P>The little indu&s;trious bee is furni&s;hed by her Creator with a &s;ting, to pre&s;erve for her own u&s;e her &s;weet honey, the fruit of her toil and indu&s;try.</P>
<P>The ox has his horns; and the hor&s;e his teeth and hoofs.&mdash;The deer her feet for flight, and the fowls their wings to e&s;cape danger and pre&s;erve them&s;elves. And &s;hall man, the noble&s;t creature in this lower world, be de&s;titute of this nece&s;&s;ary principle! which we &s;ee engraved by in&s;tinct on the irrational creation: Man is ble&s;t with rea&s;on to direct his enquiries, in &s;earch of happine&s;s. His maker God allows him to &s;eek to be as happy as he po&s;&s;ibly can, both in this life and the life to come. But &s;ince man is a fallen, &s;inful creature, he has lo&s;t his true road to happine&s;s&mdash;and can never find it, until his Maker points it out to him in the Holy Bible. Here we are taught how to conduct both in the civil and religious life: We are certain the &s;criptures allow us to defend our|&s;elves in the be&s;t manner we can again&s;t an enemy.</P>
<P>Therefore, &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages, as would &s;eem to
<PB N="14" REF="013862_0012_0F9254B2AAB78818">
&s;peak a different language; &s;uch as tho&s;e already quoted, mu&s;t be under&s;tood, in a con&s;i&s;tency with this great law of nature; as well as con&s;i&s;tent with other parts of &s;cripture. For Chri&s;t came not to make void, or de&s;troy the law, but to ful|fil&mdash;when therefore we are forbid to &s;hed blood, or to kill; it is innocent blood is meant&mdash;but this doth not forbid to execute a murderer. The divine law requires, that a murderer &s;hould be executed, and forbids to take a ran&s;om for his life.</P>
<P>Al&s;o, when a body of wicked people join to|gether, or a nation unite, to fall upon and de|&s;troy without any ju&s;t cau&s;e an innocent people: The in&s;uited, or invaded people, are then to unite together, to oppo&s;e, expel and puni&s;h the guilty invaders&mdash;as in Judges v.23. <HI>Cur&s;e ye Meroz, (&s;aid the Angel of the Lord) cur&s;e ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof: Becau&s;e they came not to the help of the Lord, again&s;t the mighty:</HI> And Jeremiah xlviii.10. <HI>Cur&s;ed be he that doth the work of the Lord deceitfully; and cur&s;ed be he that keepeth back his &s;word from blood:</HI> And in Luke xxii.36. Je&s;us Chri&s;t told his Di&s;ciples to arm them&s;elves again&s;t approaching danger.&mdash;<HI>And he that hath no &s;word let him &s;ell his garment and buy one.</HI></P>
<P>And &s;ince our Lord did not allow the Di&s;ciples then to defend them&s;elves by their weapons, for
<PB N="15" REF="013862_0013_0F9254B34B84F1B0">
when Peter cut off Malchus's ear he immediately healed it, and bid Peter to put up his &s;word, to let them know, and the enemy al&s;o know, that he was Lord of life and death&mdash;and that the Di&s;ciples were &s;afe with &s;uch a per&s;on as Je&s;us, while the age of miracles continued; I &s;ay, &s;ince this was the ca&s;e then, we mu&s;t under&s;tand the pa&s;&s;age to intend, that it is both lawful and a duty, for the followers of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in a time and age, when we are not to expect miracles, to arm our&s;elves and u&s;e our arms for our own pre|&s;ervation again&s;t any invading enemy.</P>
<P>Al&s;o, it mu&s;t of cour&s;e follow, that where our ble&s;&s;ed Lord enjoins us, when &s;mote on the one cheek, to turn the other al&s;o, he does not mean to forbid us to u&s;e lawful and proper means of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation. But the meaning mu&s;t be as the phra&s;e is proverbial, that we &s;hould at no time di&s;cover a revengeful or unforgiving di&s;po|&s;ition; but &s;hould be ready to put up with a good deal of ill-u&s;age, before we would create di&s;turb|ance,&mdash;yea that we &s;hould do any thing con&s;i&s;t|ent with our own &s;afety. Again, where our Lord enjoins us to love our enemies&mdash;he can't po&s;&s;ibly mean that we &s;hould love them better than our|&s;elves&mdash;that we &s;hould put it in the enemy's power to kill us, when we had it in our power to &s;ave
<PB N="16" REF="013862_0014_0F9254B7A4399328">
our own life, by killing the enemy. I &s;ay, this cannot be the meaning; for that expo&s;ition will thwart the original fir&s;t great law of &s;elf-pre|&s;ervation. The meaning therefore mu&s;t be, that we do not cheri&s;h a &s;pirit of hatred towards the enemies, and would be willing to be reconciled again&mdash;and would be de&s;irous, the enemy would be convinced of his evil &s;entiment again&s;t us, that we might be again on friendly terms,&mdash;that we can be &s;incere in our prayer to God, to bring &s;uch a de&s;irable event to pa&s;s. Again,</P>
<P>That a &s;elf-defen&s;ive war is lawful, I will prove from the conduct of Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf. If civil government is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, and war is nece&s;&s;ary, at times, in government, as has been already proved; then it will follow, that tho&s;e who &s;upport civil government, do &s;upport war, and &s;o of con&s;equence approve of war. But Je&s;us Chri&s;t did pay his tribute money, to the Emperor Tiberius, Matthew xvii, 27. And tho&s;e who are acquainted with the life of Tiberius Cae|&s;ar know that he had frequent wars. Our Lord did here, as in &s;everal other places, draw a line of di&s;tinction between church and &s;tate; the church was his own kingdom, and &s;piritual in its nature and government, and was not of this world; but the &s;tate was a di&s;tinct con&s;titution, was of this world, was purely civil, and it was not e&s;&s;ential
<PB N="17" REF="013862_0015_0F9254B7D11AC8C0">
to the being of an Emperor, of what &s;ort of re|ligion he was of, or whether of any, as was the ca&s;e of Tiberius, Tiberius was a Pagan; but as the Jews were tributaries to the Romans, and our Lord was a Jew by birth, he paid his tax as a peaceable member of the commonwealth; but had our Lord been a Mennoni&s;t he would have refu&s;ed to pay tribute, to &s;upport war, which &s;hews the ab&s;urdity of the&s;e people's conduct.</P>
<P>Had our Lord been a Covenanter of the church of Scotland, he would refu&s;e to pay tribute, be|cau&s;e the Emperor was not a Covenanter.&mdash;I own, it is not e&s;&s;ential to the very being of a King to be a Chri&s;tian, yet it is e&s;&s;ential to the being of a good man, to be a Chri&s;tian; and certainly the more pious and truly godly any Chri&s;tian ru|ler is, if he is not a bigot to a party, or certain denomination, but equally regardful of all, the regular, &s;ober, and well behaving, in all his do|minions the happier for the people.&mdash;In Rom. 13, from the beginning, to the 7th ver&s;e, we are in|&s;tructed at large the duty we owe to civil govern|ment, but if it was unlawful and anti-Chri&s;tian, or anti-&s;criptural to &s;upport war, it would be un|lawful to pay taxes; if it is unlawful to go to war, it is unlawful to pay another to do it, or to go to do it: What a fooli&s;h trick tho&s;e people
<PB N="18" REF="013862_0016_0F9254B9651608A8">
put on their con&s;ciences, who for the rea&s;ons al|ready mentioned will not pay their taxes, and yet let others come and take their money, where they can find it, and be &s;ure they will leave it where they can find it handily.</P>
<P>I think I have now proved, from the light of nature, from the rea&s;on of things &mdash; from the Old and New-Te&s;tament, as well as from the example of Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles, that a &s;elf-defen&s;ive war is lawful.</P>
<P>Now tho&s;e who deny this doctrine ought, if they would be ingenuous, candid and hone&s;t, to place their argument on this footing: Suppo&s;e them&s;elves all on &s;ome part of our Globe, and without any connection with any people but them|&s;elves, they had all the nece&s;&s;aries of life; in &s;uch a &s;ituation, if they carry with them the common nature of the human &s;pecies, as it has di&s;covered it&s;elf in the world in every age, &s;ince the fall of Adam; the&s;e good, peaceable, inoffen&s;ive people would &s;oon find evil di&s;po&s;itions and practices break out even among them&s;elves; if they would then make no re&s;i&s;tance at all, to tho&s;e evils, but on their avowed principles, when &s;mote on the one cheek, turn the other; there would &s;oon be an end of their &s;ociety&mdash;the evil would &s;oon de|&s;troy the peaceable and good out of the world;
