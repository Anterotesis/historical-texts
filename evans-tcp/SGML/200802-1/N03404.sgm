<P><HI>_THE Publication of a Pamphlet call'd</HI> An An&s;wer to the Hamp&s;hire Narrative, <HI>having been the Means to keep up the Clamour that has been rai&s;ed again&s;t us who di&s;approved of Mr.</HI> Breck's <HI>Settlement at</HI> Springfield, <HI>we have for &s;ome Months been &s;ilent, promi&s;ing our &s;elves this Advantage thereby, That tho&s;e who&s;e Spirits have been heated, being by this Time cooled, and Preju|dices on all &s;ides much abated, every body will be more ready to con&s;ider the Matter with coolne&s;s and &s;edatene&s;s, and be under Advantage to look on the Ca&s;e as it really is, and allow arguments their proper Force. The Author of the Pamphlet which we endeavour to an&s;wer, having let us know by &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages in the Book,</HI> viz. <HI>in Page</HI> 53, 54, 55, 56, &amp;c. <HI>That he is a Mini&s;ter, was one of the Council, and one that came from</HI> Bo&s;ton, <HI>we have thought be&s;t, by directing a Letter to him, to addre&s;s our&s;elves to all the Gentlemen who were concerned in the Council with him.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Reverend Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_WE your Brethren, in the calling of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and Mini&s;try of his Go&s;pel, of the County of <HI>Hamp&s;hire,</HI> who from the Be|ginning of your acting in the <HI>Spring|field</HI> Affair, have been looked upon, and treated by you, as e&s;pecially, and above all others obnoxious. And in all your Proceedings, from fir&s;t to la&s;t, have been the Butt of your Re&s;entment and Ob|loquy, and e&s;pecially in your Book called <HI>An An&s;wer to the Hamp&s;hire Narrative,</HI> have been treated with Indig|nity and Contempt, and repre&s;ented with a great Mani|fe&s;tation of Di&s;dain and In&s;ult as a Set of wicked, con|temptible Men, looking upon it that you have gone out of the Way of your Duty, and acted much again&s;t the Honour of Chri&s;t, and the Intere&s;t of Chri&s;tianity, and to the Prejudice of the mini&s;terial Character, do think our&s;elves obliged, as we are your fellow Chri&s;tians and Brethren in the Mini&s;try, not only to vindicate our&s;elves, but to labour to lead you to a Sen&s;e of your Error, which
<PB N="2" REF="004152_0005_1003DF5F34B6DF80">
tho' we have rea&s;on to fear, from the Temper and Pre|judice you have di&s;covered in your An&s;wer, is not very likely to be &s;ucce&s;sful; yet leaving the Event with GOD, we think our&s;elves bound to endeavour. And would ob&s;erve in general, That you have almost wholly over|looked the Merits of the Cau&s;e in Di&s;pute between us, and in&s;tead of that, have been plea&s;ed to divert your Readers with &s;uch ludicrous and unfriendly Reflections on our Narrative and Conduct, as you have tho't fit, for Rea&s;ons be&s;t known to your&s;elf. And therefore, for our own Vindication and your Conviction, we have tho't it necessary to remark and reply to <HI>&s;ome of the exceptio|nal Pa&s;&s;ages</HI> in it.</P>
<P>In Page 1 and 2, where you di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e who di&s;approved of Mr. <HI>Breck'</HI>s Settlement at <HI>Springfield,</HI> and &s;ent their Prote&s;t again&s;t it, from tho&s;e that were called to judge in the Affair, &s;peaking of the Letter, you &s;ay, <HI>of which Number were the elde&s;t Mini&s;ters in their own County,</HI> whereby 'tis in&s;inuated, that the elde&s;t Mini&s;ters in the County acted, when you know that the true State of the Ca&s;e was thus, That the <HI>elde&s;t Mini&s;ter</HI> of all <HI>in the County,</HI> and the elde&s;t in the Province but one, was one that <HI>di&s;approved and prote&s;ted;</HI> the two next <HI>acted:</HI> the four next <HI>di&s;approved;</HI> and the next <HI>acted:</HI> Which three were all in the County that <HI>acted.</HI> Now, Sir, the Ca&s;e being thus, was not this that you gave an unfair Re|pre&s;entation: We appeal to all your Readers that had their Information only from your Book, whether they han't been led by it, to apprehend the Ca&s;e quite different from what we have now repre&s;ented. In the &s;ame Place you blame us that we did not leave tho&s;e <HI>elde&s;t Mini&s;ters that acted</HI> with others, to act according to their own Light. And why, <HI>Reverend Sir,</HI> could not you, the Mi|ni&s;ters that come from <HI>Boston,</HI> leave them to act <HI>according to their own Light,</HI> without taking &s;uch abundant Pains in urging them to act again&s;t what they of them&s;elves were inclined to, as you know you did the Reverend Mr. <HI>Chauncey, the elde&s;t that acted,</HI> who has often de|clared, in the hearing of &s;ome of us, that had he not been exceedingly importuned, he would not have <HI>acted,</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="004152_0006_1003E05E8163CA08">
and that he long re&s;i&s;ted and oppo&s;ed, but that you over|came him, at both times of the Council's meeting. And the Reverend Mr. <HI>Devotion,</HI> before the Council came up, did &s;ufficiently declare in our hearing, his Di&s;inclination to <HI>act</HI> in the Ca&s;e: And there are many other concur|ring Evidences, that he would not <HI>have acted</HI> had not you &s;ent to him, urging him to it.</P>
<P>In Page 2, you boldly charge us with running this Controver&s;y into the publick Prints. Certainly you ought not thus to have declared this to the World before you knew it; and yet afterwards, before you get to the Bot|tom of the Page, you implicitly confe&s;s, that you don't know it; for you &s;peak of the two Letters in the <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> Journal, as publi&s;hed by us, <HI>or &s;omebody that undertook our Vindication:</HI> If it was only &s;omebody that undertook our Vindication, how does it thence follow, as you &s;ay, that we not being <HI>content that the Matter &s;hould remain the Subject of Conver&s;ation only, run it into the publick Prints:</HI> And yet afterwards again, in the Margin, you charge the publi&s;hing the&s;e Letters at &s;uch a Time, on us, as an In&s;tance of our <HI>unfair Way of managing.</HI> In|deed, we none of us had any hand in publi&s;hing either of tho&s;e Letters, and knew not that any &s;uch Letters were publi&s;hed, or like to be publi&s;hed, or were in Be|ing, 'till we &s;aw them in the publick Prints: And if they had been publi&s;hed by us, it would have been ve|ry injuriou&s;ly &s;aid, that it was before any thing was pub|li&s;hed on the other &s;ide: Whereas you very well know, the Complaint of <HI>Springfield</HI> Church to the General A&s;&s;embly, was publi&s;hed in the <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> Gazette, and the Letters refer'd to in your An&s;wer, we &s;uppo&s;e, were oc|ca&s;ioned by that Publication, and a &s;tolen Letter that was written on this Affair, was before this expo&s;ed in the publick Prints, with ludicrous Reflections, to render the Author, and the Cau&s;e he appeared in, ridiculous in the Eyes of the World.</P>
<P>Thus, <HI>Sir,</HI> in&s;tead of our running our own Writings fir&s;t into Print, tho&s;e of your Party &s;tole 'em, and expos'd 'em, and ridicul'd 'em in the publick Prints. And then you write again&punc; crying down both the Mi|ni&s;ters
<PB N="4" REF="004152_0007_1003BA835211E678">
and Magi&s;trates of the County, before ever we publi&s;h'd any thing at all: And this after you had, in a great Mea&s;ure filled the Country with Reproaches of us, and rai&s;ed a general Cry again&s;t us, as a &s;et of ambitious, arbitrary, and unju&s;t U&s;urpers, in the principal Part of the Country, where we, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">a&s;on of our Di&s;tance, have no other Way to &s;peak for our&s;elves but by the Pre&s;s: And then after all cry out of us for <HI>running the Matter into the publick Prints.</HI></P>
<P>As to the Things in&s;i&s;ted on, Page 3, 4, and 5. we &s;hall have Occa&s;ion to &s;peak afterwards. In Page 5,&amp;6, after you had for two or three Pages been ridiculing our <HI>A&s;&s;ociation,</HI> and its Acts and Pretentions, you &s;ay, <Q>And when they (<HI>i. e. A&s;&s;ociations</HI>) come <HI>ex-officio,</HI> to ad|mini&s;ter Oaths, it &s;eems al&s;o to intrench upon the Au|thority of the civil Magi&s;trate;</Q> and then in the Mar|gin you &s;ay to the World, <Q>The Form of an Oath, or Declaration taken by a particular Mini&s;ter, by Order of an <HI>A&s;&s;ociation,</HI> may be &s;een in the <HI>Narrative</HI> Page 49, the fir&s;t, we &s;uppo&s;e, of the Kind that has been given to the Publick, and therefore worthy of &s;pecial Notice.</Q> The Thing referred to in the <HI>Narrative,.</HI> is, that a par|ticular Mini&s;ter in <HI>Connecticut</HI> took the Evidence of cer|tain Per&s;ons, in order to be &s;ent to <HI>Springfield,</HI> at the Time of the &s;itting of the Council there; and they in giving their Evidence declared <HI>before GOD the Searcher of all Hearts,</HI> that their Evidence was <HI>the Truth, the whole Truth, and nothing but, the Truth.</HI></P>
<P>Now, Reverend <HI>Sir,</HI> &s;uppo&s;e this were indeed a pro|per Oath, and this Mini&s;ter had been appointed to take it by the <HI>A&s;&s;ociation</HI> to which he belonged, What is that to us that an <HI>A&s;&s;ociation</HI> in <HI>Connecticut</HI> remote from us did &s;o? As it is be&s;ide our Intention to &s;ay any thing on Defence of the A&s;&s;ociation of the County of <HI>Windham,</HI> &s;o we are well a&s;&s;ured, that tho&s;e&punc; Gentlemen are well able to defend them&s;elves, when it &s;hall be needful for them to free them&s;elves from Apprehen&s;ions of the civil Magi&s;trate in their own Colony, who have often heard of &s;uch kind of Oaths or Declarations, without any Su&s;|picion of the Mini&s;ters <HI>intrenching</HI> upon their Office.
<PB N="5" REF="004152_0008_1003E0690CAE9118">
And we are very &s;orry that the Reverend Council have never heard of nor &s;een any &s;uch kind of Oath or De|claration in all the Di&s;cipline of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> and of <HI>Scotland</HI> or other <HI>reformed Churches abroad,</HI> which, if they had, it &s;eems &s;trange that they &s;hould think there was &s;o much Occa&s;ion to put the Civil Magi&s;trate upon drawing his Sword upon A&s;&s;ociations for pre&s;uming to do it.</P>
<P>In Page 9, after mentioning &s;ome Things in the Nar|rative that you &s;ay are low and trifling, you &s;ay. <Q>Ano|ther pretty Tale we are entertained with, in Page 63, there they tell us, that Mr. <HI>Breck,</HI> preaching from tho&s;e Words, <HI>Many are the Afflictions of the Righteous,</HI> com|pared him&s;elf to <HI>David, Mordicai,</HI> and other good Men, and tho&s;e who oppos'd him to <HI>Haman,</HI> &amp;c..</Q> Mayn't your Reader have ju&s;t Ground to &s;u&s;pect that this is but a Specimen of your Way of judging and e&s;timating Things relating to Mr. <HI>B</HI>&mdash;<HI>k,</HI> in calling it a <HI>pretty Tale,</HI> and putting of it into the Catalogue of Things that you call <HI>low and trifling,</HI> when it is related, That he that was &s;o young, and not yet ordained, &s;hould in the Pulpit, not only compare him&s;elf to <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Mordicai,</HI> and the neighbouring Mini&s;ters, that had been long &s;ettled and accepted in that Work, and are old eno' to be his Fathers, to <HI>Haman?</HI> And may we not take it as a Specimen of your Impartiality? We would pray you, Sir, to con&s;ider what you would think or &s;ay of any of us that are not &s;o much younger than you, if we &s;hould in our Pulpits, compare our&s;elves to <HI>Mordicai</HI> and you to <HI>Haman</HI> his cruel Per&s;ecutor; would it be a <HI>pretty Tale</HI> then? Would it not be horrid Prophane&s;s, and many other Things as bad? And we would pray you al&s;o to con&s;ider how vehemently you have inveighed again&s;t us in your Book for &s;aying Things of you that are far le&s;s than this. And tho' it be a <HI>low and trifling</HI> Thing, not worthy to be mentioned for Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> to &s;ay this of his Fathers in the Pulpit, yet if they do but relate a Te&s;timony publickly given by others, wherein there is &s;omething again&s;t Mr. <HI>Breck,</HI> How far is this from being a trifling Matter? In&s;tead of which they are ranked by you among

<HI>tho&s;e who&s;e tender Mercies are Cruelty;</HI> and you cry out, <HI>What can be more cruel, barbarous, more contrary to Hu|manity as well as Chri&s;tianity? What a Spirit does this di&s;cover?</HI> You &s;ay, in Page 10, This is not true, <HI>And he did not make &s;uch a Declaration as we &s;peak of, and call GOD to witne&s;s that he was innocent of the Thing; laid to his Charge;</HI> but tho' you po&s;itively deny it, yet Col. <HI>Dwight</HI> of <HI>Brookfield,</HI> and &s;everal others that were pre|&s;ent and heard him, have taken their Oath to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> before the Ju&s;tices of the County.</P>
<P>In Page 13, you &s;ay, That what we have written <HI>di&s;|covers an evil and bitter, an uncharitable and unchri&s;tian Temper and Spirit.</HI> What Occa&s;ion for this heaping of hard Words? Was it from a <HI>chri&s;tian &amp; charitable Frame of Spirit</HI> in you? Don't it favour of what you charge us with Page 8, <HI>viz</HI> a Di&s;po&s;ition <HI>to lay on all the Load that you could.</HI> The fir&s;t Thing you mention as an Evidence of our &s;howing of &s;uch a Spirit is, That we relate <HI>Things that don't enter into the Merits of the Cau&s;e;</HI> and that therefore <HI>the whole De&s;ign of them mu&s;t be only to fix, as far as we could do it a Mark of Di&s;honour and Di&s;grace where we would have it worn.</HI> Will you allow that, if this holds good, and is ju&s;t arguing in our Ca&s;e, &s;o it al&s;o is in your own in a like Ca&s;e? That if you in&s;i&s;t on many Things to our Reproach, that don't in the lea&s;t <HI>enter into the Merits of the Cau&s;e,</HI> that then we may ju&s;tly argue, That <HI>it mu&s;t be only to fix, as far as</HI> you <HI>could do it, a Mark of Di&s;honour and Di&s;grace where</HI> you <HI>would have it worn?</HI> And that therefore it <HI>di&s;covers</HI> in you <HI>an evil and bitter, an uncha|ritable and unchri&s;tian Temper and Spirit?</HI> And pray Sir, con&s;ider how much it touch'd <HI>the Merits of the Cau&s;e,</HI> for you &s;o much to in&s;i&s;t upon the <HI>Bulk</HI> of our Book, with &s;o much Scoff and Jeer; repeating it over and ever &s;o often, and declaring how it <HI>contain'd &s;even Sheets</HI> (tho' yours contain'd no le&s;s) and that it was mounted to <HI>Four Shillings and Six Pence</HI> Price (tho' your's was no le&s;s co&s;tly than ours) And how much did it concern the <HI>Merits of the Cau&s;e,</HI> for you, repeatedly and in a deri&s;ory Manner, to mention it that we &s;ay on the Title Page of our Book <HI>WRITTEN BY THEMSELVES?</HI> And how much

<P>Suppo&s;ing it be &s;o indeed, that we can't write &s;o correctly and methodically as you can, or &s;uppo&s;ing you could make it manife&s;t, that we did not know how to write well eno' to appear in Print, yet how does that alter the State of the Argument, with Regard to <HI>the Merits of the Cau&s;e?</HI> And what other End could you have in in&s;i&s;ting on it, than <HI>to fix</HI> that <HI>Mark of Di&s;honour and Di&s;grace upon us,</HI> that we have written in a weak and ridiculous manner?</P>

In Page 14, after mentioning our Pretences of tender|ne&s;s to Mr. <HI>Breck,</HI> you &s;ay <Q>Yet it &s;eems they &s;o far for|got their own Cautions, that as &s;oon as Mr. <HI>B</HI>&mdash;<HI>k</HI> left <HI>Springfield</HI> the fir&s;t time, they let the Papers from <HI>Connecticut</HI> go about the Pari&s;h, when he was not there to make any An&s;wer for him&s;elf.</Q> In which you deal unju&s;tly by us. Tho&s;e Papers from <HI>Connecticut</HI> were lodged in Mr. <HI>Hopkins'</HI>s Hands, and when the Pari&s;h had cho&s;en a Committee to ask the Advice of the Mini&s;ters of the County, whether they &s;hould again make Appli|cation to Mr. <HI>B</HI>&mdash;<HI>k,</HI> that Committee went to Mr. <HI>Hop|kins,</HI> and de&s;ired that they might have tho&s;e Papers to carry them to the Mini&s;ters in the upper Part of the County (who&s;e Advice they intended fir&s;t to ask) giving this as a Rea&s;on for it, <HI>viz.</HI> That tho&s;e Gentle|men had heard the Papers but once, and might be the better able to give Advice, if they had a &s;econd View of them, Mr. <HI>Hopkins</HI> therefore (after cautioning them not to make any ill U&s;e of them) gave them the Papers, and they being Mr. <HI>Breck'</HI>s Friends, he had no Su&s;picion that they would u&s;e them to his Damage, nor have we any Rea&s;on to think they did: It is true they kept them much longer in their Hands than was expected, and where they went we know not, but if <HI>they went about the Pari&s;h</HI> to Mr. <HI>Breck'</HI>s Damage, Mr. <HI>Breck'</HI>s Friends are to blame for it, and not the Mini&s;ters of the County: And we a&s;&s;ure you that they never <HI>went about the Pari&s;h</HI> any time, except while they were in the keeping of his Friends of that Pari&s;h.</P>

<P>The <HI>A&s;&s;ociation,</HI> while the Affair was in their Hands, never had proceeded any further than only to in&s;i&s;t on a particular Hearing of the Ca&s;e, Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> and the Wit|ne&s;&s;es being Face to Face, in order to our concurring in his Settlement at <HI>Springfield:</HI> And this you know is what we were e&s;pecially cryed out again&s;t for, that we would not accept of his Vindication, or account of him&s;elf in an Examination without this. We judged that the Informa|tion we had had again&s;t his Principles and Morals rendred &s;uch a particular Enquiry nece&s;&s;ary, and this we were concern'd to &s;how to the World for our Vindication, and how could we po&s;&s;ibly do it without letting the World know what the&s;e Informations or Te&s;timonies were? It was nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;hou'd relate tho&s;e Te&s;timonies <HI>as they were,</HI> if we had publi&s;h'd only a Part and conceal'd a Part, &s;hould we not have given a handle to tho&s;e who

&s;tand ready to reproach us? Could we have expected any other from your &s;elf, who are &s;o ready to take all Advantages again&s;t us, than that you would cry out that our Te&s;timonies, on which we proceeded, were &s;uch as we dur&s;t not let the World &s;ee? And it was e&s;pecially nece&s;&s;ary that that Part of the Information that re&s;pec|ted his Veracity &s;hould be declared, for it was particu|larly on the Account of this that we think our&s;elves to be vindicated, for not accepting what he &s;hould &s;ay of himself without hearing him and the Witne&s;&s;es Face to Face, which was the Thing we were e&s;pecially con|demned for: And we were brought to this Nece&s;&s;ity of giving this Narrative very much by Mr. <HI>Breck'</HI>s own Reproaches and Revilings of us, of which his comparing us to <HI>Haman</HI> in the Pulpit, which you call a <HI>pretty Tale,</HI> is a Specimen: This we think would have ju&s;tified us in publi&s;hing that Te&s;timony, tho' this Matter, which one Thing te&s;tified has a Reference to, had been of that Nature as would have greatly wronged his Reputation; but you your&s;elf &s;eem to &s;peak as tho' it had very little of that Tendency.&mdash;That we mu&s;t by no Means be al|lowed to &s;peak of Mr. <HI>Breck'</HI>s former Faults, or &s;o much as give an Account of Te&s;timonies that contain a Refe|rence to them, tho' laid under never &s;o great Nece&s;&s;ity by him him&s;elf, by his Reproaches of us, and tho' our Names never &s;o much &s;uffered in the Country by them, and tho' the&s;e Faults being publi&s;hed tend very little to his Di&s;credit, (as by your own arguing they do) comes to this, that we ought to be va&s;tly more tender of Mr. <HI>Breck'</HI>s Credit than our own, even to that Degree that we are oblig'd to yield up our Reputation a Sacrifice to his Revilings, and to be at his Mercy rather than vindi|cate our&s;elves in the lea&s;t to the wrong of his Reputation. What we do is barely to recite Mr. <HI>Clap'</HI>s Te&s;timony, wherein Mr. <HI>Breck'</HI>s &s;tealing Books is refer'd to, without one Reflection on that Particular, or any Hint as though we made any U&s;e of that Crime, or any thing &s;aid about it throughout the whole Book, nor was that thing ever in&s;i&s;ted upon by us, among our&s;elves, or even mention'd by us, as any Article again&s;t him, in this Controver&s;y; and
<PB N="11" REF="004152_0014_1003BB03F64A54A8">
the only Rea&s;on why it appear'd in our Book, was be|cau&s;e Mr. <HI>Clap'</HI>s Information, which contain'd a Reference to it, could not be publi&s;h'd without it: And yet you charge <HI>us,</HI> our&s;elves, with <HI>fa&s;tening this Charge upon him:</HI> Is our giving an hi&s;torical Account of Another's Te&s;ti|mony, wherein he had occa&s;ional Reference to a Fault committed, without &s;aying a Word before or after about it, <HI>our fa&s;tening a Charge of that Fault upon him?</HI> Yea, you charge us with being the Contrivers of it, and tell the World for what End we contrived it, in &s;aying that <HI>for fear the Truth of the Story &s;hould be que&s;tioned, we take Care to direct all that de&s;ire to be confirm'd to enquire of &s;uch and &s;uch Per&s;ons.</HI> Plea&s;e, Sir, to &s;uffer your own Con&s;cience to make its own Reflections upon this.</P>
<P>In Page 16, and 17, you ca&s;t &s;ome Reflections upon Mr. <HI>Clap,</HI> upon this Account; and &s;ay, <Q>Perhaps it may be &s;aid Mr. <HI>Clap</HI> made the Enquiry with a charita|ble Hope the Story was <HI>not true,</HI> and a kind De|&s;ign <HI>to contradict it,</HI> when he heard it mention'd.</Q> And then you add, <Q>Whether it was ju&s;t or not, there is &s;ome Rea&s;on to doubt, when he could write to a Mini&s;ter in <HI>Bo&s;ton, to de&s;ire</HI> him to make Enquiry into Mr. <HI>Breck'</HI>s Conduct, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>The Rea&s;on of Mr. <HI>Clap'</HI>s informing Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> of that Story, was becau&s;e he was often <HI>enquired of</HI> by the Peo|ple of <HI>Windham,</HI> and he knowing nothing about it tho't it proper to give Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> an Opportunity <HI>to vindicate</HI> him&s;elf. And when he <HI>had ab&s;olutely denied</HI> the Truth of the Story, many &s;u&s;pected his <HI>Veracity;</HI> and others, who pretended to be his peculiar Friends, &s;uppo&s;ed that the Story was <HI>ab&s;olutely fal&s;e and &s;candalous,</HI> and therefore earne&s;tly &s;ollicited Mr. <HI>Clap</HI> to write a Letter to &s;ome Gentleman, who was acquainted with him, to know the Truth of the Story; that &s;o if he were <HI>innocent</HI> he might be <HI>vindicated,</HI> or if <HI>otherwi&s;e</HI> he might be made &s;en&s;ible of his Fault <HI>in denying of it.</HI> And accordingly Mr. <HI>Clap</HI> was prevailed upon to write a Letter for that End. And, Sir, what Colour is there for any Reflection upon Mr. <HI>Clap</HI> on this Account? Will you &s;ay it was an <HI>unchri&s;|tian or impertinent</HI> Thing in Mr. <HI>Clap,</HI> to act &s;uch a
<PB N="12" REF="004152_0015_1003DF99C2694B58">
<HI>chri&s;tian</HI> Part, as to inform a Gentleman of an ill Report which there was about him, that &s;o he might have Op|portunity to vindicate him&s;elf, and that <HI>he</HI> might be in a better Capacity of vindicating of him, and to comply with the Importunity of his Friends to write a Letter for that End? Or if Mr <HI>Clap</HI> began afterwards to &s;u&s;pect that the Story was <HI>true,</HI> and &s;o that Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> was not a <HI>Man of Truth</HI> in denying of it, mu&s;t it then be a Fault in Mr. <HI>Clap,</HI> to de&s;ire to be &s;ati&s;fied in that Point, when there was &s;ome Pro|bability that he might be &s;ettled over Part of his Church.</P>
<P>In Page 18, you charge Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> of <HI>Long-Meadow</HI> with being the Means that the Contents of the Reverend Dr. <HI>Colman'</HI>s Letter, was &s;pread about <HI>Springfield</HI> before it reach'd where it was directed. How did you know that it was before it had reach'd where it was directed? Have you not ventur'd po&s;itively to a&s;&s;ert this before the World on meer Conjecture? For what is a&s;&s;erted is contrary to Fact, for the Letter was &s;ent from <HI>Brookfield</HI> to the Rev. Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> of <HI>Hatfield,</HI> to whom it was directed, by his Daughter, and reach'd to him the &s;ame Day that Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> of <HI>Long-Meadow</HI> got Home him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>Again, 'Tis there repre&s;ented as tho' the Author of that Letter had written to Mr. <HI>Williams,</HI> manife&s;ting his Di&s;like of letting the Contents of that Letter be known; which is quite wrong. The Words of the Doctor's Letter are the&s;e, <Q>Mr. <HI>Cooper</HI> tells me of my Letter's being put into the Hands of a mean Per&s;on, I think a Shoe maker, who carried it from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e.</Q> The Reverend Doctor never blam'd Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> for letting the Contents of the Letter be known, nor did Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> go about to excu&s;e him&s;elf for &s;o doing; but to let the Doctor know that the Report was not true which the Rev. Mr. <HI>Cooper</HI> had told him, of his doing so ungentlemanly a Thing, as to put a Letter of his, that was committed to his Care, into the Hands of a Shoe-maker, to be carried from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>At the Bottom of the &s;ame Page, you tell the World, That our Book <HI>abounds with Mi&s;repre&s;entations and Un|truths;</HI> and el&s;ewhere are often charging us with <HI>vile</HI>

and <HI>wilful Mi&s;repre&s;entations;</HI> yea, you repre&s;ent us as Per&s;ons &s;o guilty in this Matter, that our Word is of no Significancy, or is not to be taken; your Words are, Page 58, <HI>And how &s;hould &s;uch Men be credited in their Repre|&s;entations of other Matters.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Cooper,</HI> in his Letter to Mr. <HI>Hopkins,</HI> which he wrote to him after our Book had been publi&s;hed &s;o long that we may well conclude he had &s;een it, expre&s;&s;es Charity for us all with Re&s;pect to our Varacity: His Words are the&s;e, <Q>I thank GOD, my Charity is not &s;o &s;hock'd, with re&s;pect to Brother <HI>Hopkins,</HI> or any of the Mini&s;ters of <HI>Hamp&s;hire,</HI> as to &s;u&s;pect them, after all the Stories I have heard, to be guilty of wilful De|parture from Truth and Fact.</Q> Mr. <HI>Cooper</HI> knows whether he had any Hand in writing this Book; if he had, and believed in his Heart, as he &s;ays to Mr. <HI>Hop|kins,</HI> certainly it was very injurious in him, &s;o abundant|ly to repre&s;ent to the World, as if we &s;o abounded in Ly|ing, as that there was no Tru&s;t to be put in our Words, &s;o publickly to wound our Reputation, contrary to what he thought in his own Heart, or at the &s;ame Time, that he believed that we were Men of Truth, &s;o as not &s;o much as to &s;u&s;pect that we were otherwi&s;e, and to thank GOD <HI>that he had &s;o much Charity for us.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t In&s;tance you mention of a Mi&s;repre&s;entation, wherein you &s;ay, <HI>our Ha&s;te and Warmth probably carried us beyond our Evidence,</HI> is in &s;aying that the Mini&s;ters that came from <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> had joyned in giving Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> a Cer|tificate of his Orthodoxy, when but one of them had &s;igned it: And tho' you find this Mi&s;take corrected in the End of the Book, yet you &s;ay it was done by a Gen|tleman in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> that look'd over that Half Sheet: You repeat this Matter again, Page 36, you &s;ay <HI>if you mi&s;take not</HI> it was &s;o; but why, Rev. Sir, will you thus treat your Brethren in the Mini&s;try, to publi&s;h &s;uch a Thing to di&s;parage us, and render us vile in the Sight of the World on a meer Conjecture; when indeed your Gue&s;s is entirely wrong, for the Error was corrected by the &s;ame Per&s;on that made it, &amp; 'tis mention'd as an <HI>Erratum</HI> in the End of the Book, in his own Words, as he &s;ent them

<P>Certainly, Sir, when you was blaming us for going be|yond our Evidence, it did not become you in the very &s;ame In&s;tance you produce to prove it, to do the &s;ame Thing! We leave it with you to con&s;ider what Decen|cy or Ingenuity there is in thus in&s;i&s;ting on a Thing that comes corrected, repeating it in different Parts of your Book, only on a groundle&s;s Gue&s;s, that not we, but &s;omebody el&s;e corrected it: Don't this again &s;how that you endeavour'd <HI>to lay on all the Load you po&s;&s;ibly could,</HI> and that you was greedy of In&s;tances of <HI>Untruth and Mi&s;repre&s;entation</HI> in us; otherwi&s;e why would not &s;uch a Multitude of other In&s;tances, that you pretend you have found, that ben't mention'd as <HI>Errata,</HI> &s;uffice you?</P>
<P>In An&s;wer to our <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Argument to prove that tho&s;e that &s;at at <HI>Springfield,</HI> and took upon them to &s;it there as Judges of that Ca&s;e, were not regularly called there|to, viz <HI>Becau&s;e the prevailing Part of them were not of neighbouring Churches, but fetched from remote Parts of the Country, in neglect of the Churches of the Neighbour|hood, and in Oppo&s;ition to the Body of neighbouring Mini&s;ters,</HI> you &s;ay, fir&s;t, that it was becau&s;e one of the Churches of the Neighbourhood that was &s;ent for would not come, that it was &s;o that the prevailing Part was of remote Churches: And if you had told the whole Truth, would you not have &s;aid too that but one of the Churches of the County would have come, if you that came from <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> had let them alone? You &s;peak of the Rev. Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> of <HI>Hatfield,</HI> his refu&s;ing to come, as a Thing that &s;trengthened your Warrant to act; but it &s;eems to us, that con&s;idering his Age, and that he was the prin|cipal Per&s;on of all that <HI>Springfield</HI> applied to, his refu|&s;ing to come, as di&s;countenancing the Method of pro|ceeding, &s;hould' have rather made you more &s;low in Act|ing, e&s;pecially when he not only refu&s;ed to come, but entred his &s;olemn Prote&s;t again&s;t your Proceedings.</P>
<P>Then you proceed to reply to what we produce from the <HI>Platform:</HI> And in the fir&s;t Place, you declare to the World, that we &s;aid that which we never did &s;ay&punc; Your

Words are, <Q>Are Churches in the Calling of Councils <HI>limited to the Vicinity,</HI> &s;o that it is an Irregularity and Offence to them if they don't take the <HI>next</HI> neighbouring Churches, <HI>and no other? This is what tho&s;e Gentlemen a&s;&s;ert;</HI> and they deliver it not only as their own Opi|nion, but &s;ay it was evidently the Mind of the Compo|&s;ers of the Platform.</Q> Our Words are, <Q>It appears e|vidently rea&s;onable in it&s;elf, that Churches that are by Providence planted together, and mu&s;t dwell together, &s;o as nece&s;&s;arily, above all others, to be concerned in each other's Affairs, and will be continually and una|voidably in the Way of mutual Intercour&s;e, and mutu|ally Intere&s;ted in each other's Welfare, <HI>&s;hould be joint|ly concerned in their religious Affairs, and not be neglec|ted or &s;et a&s;ide one by another,</HI> wherein other Churches are to have Influence in their Affairs, <HI>but &s;hould prin|cipally be regarded;</HI> &s;o this was evidently the Mind of the Compo&s;ers of the Platform.</Q> Why, Sir, would you &s;o abu&s;e us, and &s;train the Matter &s;o much higher than we had done, and expre&s;s a Thing that is &s;o diver&s;e from our Words, and oppo&s;ite to the plain Import of them, and then &s;ay that <HI>this is what we a&s;&s;ert?</HI> And again, lower down the &s;ame Page, you cite our Words wrong, and repre&s;ent us as &s;aying what we never &s;aid, that you may have Opportunity to ridicule us: Your Words are, 'If they had, they never would have a&s;&s;erted that (and then the following Words are in another Character, as being cited from us) <HI>as often</HI> as it directs to a particular Church to apply to other Churches&punc; it &s;pecifies neigh|bour Churches.' Our Words are, <Q>They, when they di|rect to, or mention any Application to be made by a particular Church to other Churches, <HI>from Time to Time</HI> &s;pecify neighbour Churches.</Q> Perhaps you will &s;ay this is the &s;ame Sen&s;e, tho' not the &s;ame Words; but if it be the very &s;ame Sen&s;e, Why did you not mention the &s;ame Words, &s;eeing you plainly mention them as a Citation? But we apprehend there is indeed a great Difference in the Sen&s;e: Can't the <HI>Platform from Time to Time &s;pecify neighbour Churches, when they mention any Application to be made to other Churches,</HI> and yet not do it every Time?</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="004152_0019_1003DFAF71CED2F0">
Our Words, as we conceive, imply thus much, and no more, <HI>viz</HI> That when the Platform <HI>directs a Church to apply to other Churches, it does from Time to Time &s;pecify</HI> what Churches &s;hould be applied to, and that wherever it does &s;o, <HI>it &s;pecifies neighbour Churches,</HI> and that it never <HI>&s;pecifies</HI> any other; of which the World have good Evi|dence from this, that you can find no other <HI>&s;pecified</HI> in it, who have doubtle&s;s thereby &s;earched the Platform to this End.</P>
<P>And to what Purpo&s;e is that Pa&s;&s;age that you cite from the Platform, wherein it &s;ays, That <HI>all Churches</HI> ought to pre&s;erve Communion one with another? We can conceive of nothing that you can intend by it, un|le&s;s it be this, <HI>viz.</HI> That becau&s;e the Platform &s;ays, That <HI>all Churches</HI> ought to hold Communion, that therefore they ought to exerci&s;e that Communion in every Thing that is an Act of Communion; but if this be what you mean, then it will follow, That all the Churches in the World ought to be con&s;ociated; for the Synod in 1662 mentions Con&s;ociation of Churches as one Way of exer|ci&s;ing the Communion of Churches; however, they have expre&s;ly limited that Exerci&s;e of Communion to Churches <HI>in a convenient Vicinity:</HI> Or el&s;e you mu&s;t mean, That be|cau&s;e the Platform &s;ays all Churches &s;hould hold Communi|on, &amp; one Way of Communion there mention'd is to con|&s;ult other Churches, that therefore a particular Church ought to con&s;ult all other Churches.&mdash;But 'tis ridicu|lous to infer any other from what the Platform &s;ays, than this, <HI>viz.</HI> That every Church ought to be ready to ex|erci&s;e Communion with all other Churches in all tho&s;e Ways, as the Di&s;po&s;als of Providence, in the Circum|&s;tances and Occa&s;ions of Churches &s;hall open a Door for it and call to it. And to what Purpo&s;e are tho&s;e other Pa&s;&s;ages that you cite, where the Platform &s;ays a parti|cular Church ought to con&s;ult OTHER CHURCHES? Which you &s;eem to think &s;hould be taken &s;o much Notice of, and ob&s;erve that it is &s;aid <HI>other Churches at large;</HI> does it thence follow, That the Platform neither does, nor can De&s;ign that Churches &s;hould be <HI>e&s;pecially limited to neighbour Churches?</HI> What &s;ort of arguing is
<PB N="17" REF="004152_0020_1003E093CE41EF70">
this. The Platform &s;ays, Churches &s;hould con&s;ult other Churches, therefore it no where e&s;pecially limits them to neighbour Churches! Can't the Platform tell us that we mu&s;t con&s;ult <HI>other Churches,</HI> and then afterwards tell us <HI>what other Churches?</HI> Can't a Parent advi&s;e a Child un|der Difficulties to con&s;ult <HI>others,</HI> and then in the &s;ame Di&s;course tell him <HI>who?</HI> And after he has told him, mu&s;t the Child, becau&s;e his Father fir&s;t &s;aid <HI>others,</HI> &s;till look upon him&s;elf on more directed by his Father to one than another? The Platform does indeed &s;ometimes &s;ay <HI>other Churches,</HI> but then in other Places, <HI>from Time to Time,</HI> both before and after, tells <HI>what Churches, viz.</HI> neighbour Churches; it <HI>&s;pecifies</HI> them without any <HI>Con|junction;</HI> and therefore for any to &s;uppo&s;e that the Com|po&s;ers of the Platform did not by this intend to direct Churches <HI>where to go when they con&s;ulted other Churches,</HI> is to reflect upon them as tho' they were ignorant of the Nature of Language, and did not under&s;tand what they &s;aid.&mdash;But then you add further, that <Q>We can't &s;uppo&s;e that the Compilers of the Platform always meant by neighbour Churches tho&s;e that were &s;cituated next to one another, but Churches in Communion one with another, by profe&s;&s;ing the &s;ame Faith and Order of the Go&s;pel, &s;o &s;cituated that they could and would afford Assi&s;tance to one another, as the &s;ame &s;hould be needed and de&s;ired.</Q> This we conceive is a Signification of the Expre&s;&s;ion of <HI>neighbour Churches</HI> of your own finding out: If we &s;hould &s;peak of a <HI>Family</HI> and <HI>neigh|bouring Families,</HI> or an <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> and <HI>neighbouring Hou&s;es,</HI> would it be agreeable to the common U&s;e of &s;uch Phra|&s;es, to mean a Hou&s;e in the Middle of <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> and a Par|cel of Hou&s;es in <HI>Cambridge?</HI> And what Engli&s;h would it be, if we &s;hould &s;peak of a certain <HI>Town</HI> and the <HI>neighbouring Towns</HI> thereof, to mean <HI>Springfield</HI> and the Towns in the County of <HI>Suffolk?</HI> The Legi&s;lators of the Province have often Occa&s;ion to &s;peak of <HI>neighbouring Towns,</HI> and did they under&s;tand them&s;elves, or does any Body el&s;e under|&s;tand them, in &s;uch a Kind of Sen&s;e as this?

<P>You &s;uppo&s;e that what we plead for is directly con|trary to congregational Principles, in that it renders the Government of our Churches not <HI>Congregational</HI> but <HI>Cla&s;&s;ical;</HI> but we think that it is no more Cla&s;&s;ical or contrary to the congregational Scheme, than the <HI>Con&s;oci|ation</HI> of Churches is, which the Synod &s;peaks of as what the Word of GOD commands: You cite their Words, as &s;uppo&s;ing that they will ju&s;tify what you have done; they &s;ay, <Q>Tho' in this there &s;hould be &s;pecial Refe|rence to tho&s;e Churches that are planted in a conveni|ent Vicinity, yet there &s;hould be Liberty without Of|fence, to make U&s;e of others, as the Nature of the Ca&s;e and the Advantage of Opportunity may lead thereto.</Q> But, Sir, we apprehend that you per|vert tho&s;e Words to a Purpo&s;e that is quite be&s;ide the De&s;ign of them: There is nothing in the Words that in the lea&s;t imports that the neighbour Churches &s;hould ever be <HI>&s;et a&s;ide,</HI> in order to the making U&s;e of others; but that there &s;hould ever be a <HI>&s;pecial Reference</HI> to them; tho' &s;ometimes there &s;hould be <HI>Liberty as the Nature of the Ca&s;e and Advantage of Opportunity &s;hould lead thereto,</HI> to joyn others with them: But it &s;eems plain to us that the Synod had no Thought of &s;etting a&s;ide neigh|bour Churches, as being unfit to be concern'd, but that there &s;hould &s;till be a <HI>&s;pecial Reference</HI> to them, and the Management of &s;uch Affairs &s;hould <HI>e&s;pecially</HI> be left in their Hands, tho' there might be <HI>Liberty without Offence,</HI> to join some others upon particular Occa&s;ions: This seems evident, becau&s;e 1<HI>st.</HI> The Synod, by their Manner of expre&s;&s;ing them&s;elves, &s;eem to direct to have a <HI>&s;pecial Reference</HI> to neighbour Churches, in the &s;ame Affair, and at the &s;ame time that they make U&s;e of other Churches; the <HI>latter</HI> therefore is plainly mention'd not as that which &s;ets the <HI>former</HI> a&s;ide, but what may con&s;i&s;t with it.</P>

We the Mini&s;ters of this Neighbourhood never refu|&s;ed to con&s;ent that two or three others &s;hould be joined with our A&s;&s;ociation, in this Affair of Mr. <HI>Breck:</HI> This is what we propo&s;ed once and again to Mr. <HI>Breck,</HI> another Time to the Church of <HI>Springfield,</HI> another Time to Mr. <HI>Cooper;</HI> but were always refu&s;ed, as we &s;hall fully &s;hew afterwards.</P>
<P>There is no Doubt to be made but that the Synod in 1662, would have utterly condemned doing as <HI>Spring|field</HI> Church have done, &s;etting a&s;ide all the Churches but one, in that lower Part of the County (a putting the Affair mainly into the Hands of others, is incon&s;i&s;tent with having a <HI>&s;pecial Reference to them,</HI> which the Synod directed to, at the &s;ame Time that others are made U&s;e of) and doing as you have done, in <HI>Oppo&s;ition to the Body of neighbouring Mini&s;ters,</HI> as &s;uppo&s;ing them prejudiced and unfit Per&s;ons. The Churches of this County have, from their Beginning till now, gone on in a Practice that is agreeable to the Advice of this Synod:&mdash;We are much &s;eperated from other Parts of the Province, having comparitively but little Intercour&s;e with them: Divine Providence, <HI>by our Situation,</HI> has as it were made us one Society, &s;o as that we are very much united, and una|voidably in a great Degree mutually influenced in our religious Affairs.</P>
<P>We have from the Beginning till now, always managed our eccle&s;ia&s;tical Affairs within our &s;elves; 'tis the Way which the County from its Infancy has gone on in, by the practical Agreement of all, and the Way in which our Peace has ever been maintained; &s;o that we &s;uppo&s;e we have been the free&s;t by far of any Part of the Land from unhappy Contentions in our eccle&s;ia&s;tical and religious Concerns, 'till you have overthrown our Peace, and put us into the utmo&s;t Confu&s;ion, by coming from abroad, and intermeddling in our Affairs: Yea this Way of ma|naging our eccle&s;ia&s;tical Affairs, has not only been e|&s;tabli&s;h'd by long continued practical Agreement, but al&s;o by the explicit and publickly declared Con&s;ent of many of the Churches: In the Year 1714 the Rev.

Mini&s;ters at <HI>Northampton,</HI> agree to this, That <HI>they judged it to be their Duty to be &s;ubject to a Council of the Churches of the County, until there &s;hould be &s;ome &s;uperiour Council &s;et up in the Province to which they might appeal;</HI> and agreed to make the Propo&s;als to their re&s;pective Chur|ches: To which <HI>Judgment</HI> and <HI>Determination</HI> they &s;et their Hands, as 'tis found on the Church Records of <HI>Northampton:</HI> None can remember that ever they heard of <HI>Springfield</HI> Churches refu&s;ing; indeed Mr. <HI>Brewer</HI> kept no Church Record, and none can be found there that by their Memory can determine one way or other; which &s;eems to be an Argument that it was con&s;ented to; for if it had been propos'd, and oppos'd, and rejected, they would be much more likely to remember that, than if it was only propos'd and readily agreed to, without ado: And be&s;ides, Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> &s;oon after &s;ettling at <HI>Long Meadow,</HI> Mr. <HI>Brewer</HI> furni&s;hed him with a Copy of tho&s;e Votes, in order to their being pa&s;&s;ed by his new gather'd Church.</P>
<P>This that we plead for is al&s;o mo&s;t evidently agreable to the famous <HI>Thirty Ca&s;es.</HI> Ca&s;e 15, touching the Power of chu&s;ing a Pa&s;tor, 'tis &s;aid, <Q>Mini&s;ters and Me&s;&s;engers of neighbouring Churches have Power to except again&s;t any Election of a Pa&s;tor, who by Errors or Scandals may be rendred unfit for the common Service of the Go&s;pel.</Q> By <HI>Power</HI> here no Body will be &s;o ridiculous as to under&s;tand, meerly that they have natural Ability to except again&s;t it, &s;o that they can if they try; but that they have <HI>Right.</HI> Again, <HI>Ibid.</HI> <Q>Churches may &s;uffer their Elections to be directed, yea, and be diverted by Con&s;iderations which they owe to others in the Vici|nity, without &s;urrendring their Liberties to be &s;mo|thered by any that would unju&s;tly impo&s;e thereon.</Q> Which is contrary to what you &s;uppo&s;e Page 26, 27.

<P>You &s;ay our Scheme is &s;uch as will de&s;troy the Con|gregational Scheme, becau&s;e the Platform &s;ays, the Go|vernment of the Church, &s;ince the Coming of CHRIST, is not National, Provincial, nor Cla&s;&s;ical, but Congrega|tional only: But, Sir, won't it hence follow, on the o|ther Hand, that your Principles are &s;ubver&s;ive of the con|gregational Scheme, by in&s;i&s;ting that we are under a <HI>provincial eccle&s;ia&s;tical Con&s;titution,</HI> as you &s;eem to do?

There can be but the&s;e two Ways where|by any Method or Form of Church Di&s;cipline, can take Place in a Country or Province, either by a <HI>con&s;tituting</HI> Authority, or voluntary Agreement; if it be only by vo|luntary Agreement, then it in no wi&s;e reaches any more than them that do voluntarily agree, and can't, without a great Abu&s;e of Language, be call'd a <HI>Con&s;titution:</HI> A
<HI>Con&s;titution</HI> of eccle&s;ia&s;tical Government can extend no farther than <HI>con&s;tituting</HI> Authority extends; but by the Platform it&s;elf, that you call the <HI>Con&s;titution,</HI> Church Authority don't extend beyond the Limits of a particular Congregation, Chap XVI. Sect. IV. <Q>It belongeth to Sy|nods and Councils, not to exerci&s;e Church Cen&s;ures in Way of Di&s;cipline, NOR ANY OTHER ACT OF CHURCH AUTHORITY or Juri&s;diction.</Q></P>
<P>The famous Mr. <HI>Norton,</HI> in a Pa&s;&s;age cited in the <HI>Ap|pendix</HI> to the Platform, reprinted for the fir&s;t Church in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> mentions the Platform of Church Di&s;cipline as only given in <HI>Way of Counsel:</HI> And if it be only in Way of Coun&s;el or Advice, we would pray you, Sir, to remem|ber your own Words, concerning the Nature of Advice, Page 33, <Q>We think there is a gro&s;s Ab&s;urdity in cal|ling of it Advice, and yet making it binding and ob|ligatory, and that the very Notion of asking Advice &s;uppo&s;es a Capacity and Right in them that ask it, to judge at la&s;t for them&s;elves; if it mu&s;t be followed, however un&s;uitable in the Judgment of tho&s;e to whom it is given, call it not Advice, but by its proper Name, Law, or Command.</Q> (or <HI>Con&s;titution,</HI> as you do the Ad|vice of the Synod in 1649.) Whence does this ari&s;e, that you that are &s;o zealous for congregational Princi|ples, do overturn the very lowe&s;t Foundation of the congregational Scheme? Here, Sir, again remember your own Words, Page 4, <Q>We are perfectly at a Lo&s;s by what Law or Rule they make the Churches to fol|low the civil Di&s;tricts; the Towns in the Province we know are by legi&s;lative Power laid out into Counties, but we did not know that the Churches were.</Q> So

<P>If the major Part of the Churches in the County have voted to come into a certain Method of Government, why mayn't it, by your own Ways of arguing, be a <HI>Con|&s;titution</HI> for the County, as well as the Vote of the ma|jor Part of the Churches of the Province be a <HI>Con&s;titution</HI> for the Province. Give us leave, on this Occa&s;ion, to recite to you the Words of one of the Elders of your own Council at <HI>Springfield,</HI> (and one of you that came from far, and was very active in Mr. <HI>Breck'</HI>s Favour) which he has publi&s;h'd in a &s;mall Pamphlet of his concerning <HI>Ru|ling Elders,</HI> Page 10, 11. <Q>Upon the prophetick Spirit that our Author, all on a &s;udden &s;eems to be in&s;pired with, when he tells us that the <HI>Non-conformi&s;t'</HI>s Cau&s;e in this Country depends entirely, under GOD, upon our Adherence to the Platform or the congregational Principles; which is ju&s;t like the other popular Cries we have heard of late, <HI>The&s;e, O Churches of the</HI> Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts <HI>are your great and di&s;tingui&s;hing Privileges,</HI> &amp;c.&mdash;<HI>the dying Te&s;timony of &s;ome of the worthy Fa|thers in &s;ome of their la&s;t Lecture Sermons to our Plat|form;</HI> and the like: All calculated for no other De|&s;ign than to hurry the unthinking Part of the World, into Bigotry and blind Zeal, the Re&s;ult of which will be to throw all into Confu&s;ion; and it is well if &s;ome that are active in it have not this &s;ecret De&s;ign.</Q> And much is there to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e</P>
<P>In Page 26, in Reply to what we object concerning the Council, that they were called in this Bu&s;ine&s;s in <HI>Oppo&s;ition to the Body of neighbouring Mini&s;ters;</HI> you mention there being but a &s;mall Majority of this Body, and &s;ay that <HI>at be&s;t Things lay at &s;ixes and &s;evens among us:</HI> But if what was acted can't be look'd upon, as the Act of the Body of neighbouring Mini&s;ters, becau&s;e there was but a &s;mall Majority; w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y then is what was voted in the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives called by you the Vote of the <HI>repre&s;entative Body of the Country,</HI> as it is in

But, Sir, will you allow your own arguing to be good, in which you take Occa&s;ion reproachfully to repre&s;ent us as <HI>a Set of Mini&s;ters of an arbitrary Di&s;po&s;ition,</HI> that endeavour to <HI>&s;etter and en&s;lave the Churches, and carry all Things according to our own Will, Humour and Preju|dice, and arbitrary Di&s;po&s;ition?</HI> Will you allow this Ar|gument of your's conclu&s;ive, that our Scheme is arbitrary becau&s;e it don't admit of Appeals? Then, Sir, What

will follow concerning your own Scheme, by which a Per&s;on can demand no Appeal from the Judgment of a particular Congregation? What Appeal are the poor aggrieved Brethren at <HI>Springfield</HI> allowed, in that Cau&s;e that has been agitated between them and their Brethren, that &s;o nearly concerned the eternal Welfare of their own Souls, and the Souls of their Children?

<P>In an&s;wer to our <HI>&s;econd</HI> Reason, to &s;hew that this Affair was not in a <HI>regular Manner</HI> put into your Hands, <HI>viz.</HI> That it was in a <HI>di&s;orderly Manner</HI> taken out of the Hands of the A&s;&s;ociation of the Mini&s;ters of the County, after it had been referred to them by the fir&s;t Church in <HI>Spring|field</HI> them&s;elves, and by Mr. <HI>Breck,</HI> you &s;ay that we took the Matter into our Hands before we were de&s;ir'd; and then follows a Detail of Particulars to prove it, and in|&s;i&s;t on it with an Air of Triumph, as if this were &s;uffici|ent for our utter and &s;hameful Confu&s;ion; and therefore have it over in various Parts of your Book, as Page 3, 4, and p. 28, 29, 30, 31, and al&s;o p. 77: Concerning which, we would, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> enquire, What this is to the Argument in Hand? Suppo&s;ing it was &s;o, that we fir&s;t took the Matter into our own Hands before Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> and the Church of <HI>Springfield</HI> refer'd it, does it thence follow that they never did refer it to us? Or if it evidently appears by our Actions, that we thought we had the Affair in our Hands before we had, becau&s;e before Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> and <HI>Springfield</HI> Church had put it into our Hands, does it thence follow that we had it not in our Hands, after they had indeed <HI>put it into our Hands?</HI> Does it follow, that we were mi&s;taken &s;till, in thinking we had it in <HI>our Hands</HI> becau&s;e we were mi&s;taken before?

Triumph, Page 82; we would intreat you, tho' you have treated us with &s;o much Reproach and In&s;ult, with re&s;pect to this Matter, yet now at length to look over tho&s;e Particulars that you have mention'd, of our acting in this Affair, before it was referred to us, and ask your|&s;elf, in real Soberne&s;s, whether any of the&s;e Things were more than we ought to have done as Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, and chri&s;tian Friends and Neighbours, to the Brethren of <HI>Springfield</HI> Church.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Thing you mention is, That Mr. <HI>Willi|ams</HI> of <HI>Springfield</HI> received a Letter from his Brother of <HI>Mansfield,</HI> informing that there were material Objections again&s;t Mr. <HI>Breck'</HI>s Principles and Morals, that the Mi|ni&s;ters of that Neighbourhood could inform of. Was this going too far, that Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> &s;hould <HI>receive,</HI> and read a <HI>Letter from his Brother?</HI> Was this <HI>taking the Matter into his own Hands?</HI> The next Particular is, That Mr. <HI>Williams,</HI> at <HI>We&s;tfield</HI> Lecture, &s;hewed this Letter to the other Mini&s;ters that were there: And was this an In&s;tance of <HI>U&s;urpation,</HI> when the Contents of the Letter &s;hew plainly the Author de&s;ign'd it &s;hould be communi|cated to them? The next Particular you mention is, That they advis'd that Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> &s;hould &s;ee the Letter: And was this a <HI>taking the Matter into our Hands,</HI> and an In&s;tance of our <HI>Injuriou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> that we let Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> know what was &s;ugge&s;ted again&s;t him? The next Particular was, That the Mini&s;ters of <HI>Windham</HI> County were de&s;ired to let us know what it was that they had to object again&s;t Mr. <HI>Breck;</HI> and nextly, That when tho&s;e Objections were &s;ent to us, we <HI>read them:</HI> Now, What was there in this more than what would have been prudent for Mini&s;ters, of either presbyterian or congregational Principles, to have done? As we were the neighbouring Mini&s;ters, &s;o might we not well think it probable, That at lea&s;t &s;ome of us &s;hould be called to act in Mr. <HI>Breck'</HI>s Settlement? Was it not therefore Prudence for us, when it had been &s;ignified to us by Per&s;ons so con&s;iderable, that there were material Objections of &s;uch a Nature, for us to de&s;ire to be informed what they were, in order to know how to con|duct our&s;elves? Yea, was it not both our Prudence and our Duty, on another Account al&s;o, <HI>viz.</HI> That in ca&s;e the
<PB N="27" REF="004152_0030_1003E0B7AB5F8FB8">
Objections appeared to be material, we might inform the People of <HI>Springfield</HI> of it, that they might not act blindfold, in a Matter that did &s;o greatly concern their own and their Children's eternal Good? If any one has been informed that that which his Neighbour is lay|ing up for his Food or Drink, is deadly Poi&s;on, and is &s;en|&s;ible that his Neighbour is wholly ignorant of it, and upon this, out of Concern for the Life of his Neighbour, makes &s;ome Enquiry, and upon finding of it to be &s;o in|deed, as a Neighbour and chri&s;tian Brother, gives him Notice of it, is he therefore chargeable with <HI>Tyranny and U&s;urpation, in invading</HI> his Brother's Right, that he has to judge &amp; chu&s;e for him&s;elf, with re&s;pect to his own Meat and Drink, and <HI>taking it into his own Hands,</HI> to judge for him, before he referred it to him? Does not the <HI>Situation</HI> of Chri&s;tians that dwell near one to another, whereby they have Opportunity to di&s;cern the Danger of each Other's Circum&s;tances, and to inform one another, oblige 'em to &s;uch Acts of Kindne&s;s as the&s;e? And whether we, by our <HI>Office,</HI> have any proper Authority out of the Limits of our own Congregations or no, yet we &s;uppo&s;e, no Chri&s;tians, of any Mode of Di&s;cipline will deny, but that by Vertue of our being Officers in Chri&s;t's vi&s;ible King|dom, and &s;et apart and devoted to be Mini&s;ters of his ho|ly Religion, we are under peculiar Obligations to &s;eek the Advancement of his Honour and Glory, and to prevent whatever tends to overthrow it every where, as we have Opportunity in tho&s;e Ways that imply no Exer|ci&s;e of Authority.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e, Rev.

<P>You intimate to the World that tho' <HI>Springfield</HI> Peo|ple did ask our Advice, yet that they never put the Mat|ter into our Hands as Judges, and therefore deride us for our <HI>notable arguing</HI> upon &s;uch a Suppo&s;ition; But how|ever, 'tis evident that they refer'd it to the A&s;&s;ociation, under no other Notion than of their being Judges in it, and i&s;&s;uing of it, as appears by Mr. <HI>Breck'</HI>s own Words, in his Letter to Mr <HI>Clap,</HI> which we will repeat again, <Q>If you have any Thing further to object, I suppo&s;e, if you plea&s;e, you may be heard at <HI>Springfield,</HI> on the 8th Day of <HI>April</HI> next, when and where the Matter will be i&s;&s;ued.</Q></P>

Is not this Children's Play? And is it a decent and orderly Way of treating the Body of neighbouring Mini&s;ters? And did not the Conduct of <HI>Springfield</HI> People plainly carry this in it, in that after they had had a Society-meeting, and by the Vote thereof, had refer'd the Matter to us, and had cho&s;en a Commit|tee on purpo&s;e, who came with Mr. <HI>Breck,</HI> to &s;eek the Judgment of the Mini&s;ters, and then after they had put the Mini&s;ters to the Trouble of a Con&s;ideration of the Matter, took it out of their Hands again, before ever they had Opportunity to make any Judgment, and in treating them with the greate&s;t Contempt, becau&s;e that they ad|vis'd that Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> and the Witne&s;&s;es &s;hould be heard Face to Face, that they might be capable of judging? Is there any need of looking into the Platform, in order to know whether &s;uch a Behaviour ben't irregular &amp; ab&s;urd, and that all tho&s;e that have been the Encouragers of that People in &s;uch a Method of proceeding, may be ju&s;t|ly looked upon as the Abertors of Di&s;order and Confu|sion? Such a Conduct is not only what common Sen&s;e knows to be ab&s;urd and di&s;orderly, but is &s;o by the known Principles, both of Congregationali&s;ts and Pre&s;|byterians; for <HI>Springfield</HI> Church and Mr. <HI>Breck,</HI> in the Method they began with, <HI>viz</HI> in referring the Matter to the Judgment and Advice of neighbouring Mini&s;ters, did but act in pur&s;uance of tho&s;e Principles in which both congregational and presbyterian Churches agree, (how|ever you &s;ugge&s;t as if it were not agreeable to our <HI>Con|&s;titution</HI>) and this is evident by the Heads of Agreement a&s;&s;ented to by the united Mini&s;ters, formerly called Pre&s;|byterian and Congregational, Chap.

&s;uppo&s;es that the neighbouring Pa&s;tors ought to enquire and u&s;e all proper Means, to enable them to pa&s;s a Judgment and to give Advice.</P>
<P>But you think that the Church of <HI>Springfield</HI> had &s;uf|ficient Rea&s;on for doing thus, becau&s;e Mr <HI>Breck</HI> objec|ted again&s;t one of the Committee as a Per&s;on prejudiced, and the A&s;&s;ociation would not take him off; and the Rea&s;on we give for it is, That Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> did not pre|tend to offer any Rea&s;on why he thought Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> prejudiced, and we knew nothing of our&s;elves that &s;hould incline us to think Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> an unfit Per&s;on; and we did not think it fit, without &s;ome weighty Rea|&s;on, to exclude the Mini&s;ters of the Town, who were next Neighbours, and were above all others nearly con|cern'd to have an orthodox Mini&s;ter &s;ettled there. But you &s;ay <Q><HI>that was Rea&s;on enough,</HI> it was &s;ufficient for him to &s;ay he look'd upon him prejudiced, upon this Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> ought immediately to have excu&s;ed him&s;elf, and all other Judicatures would have taken him of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></Q>.

therefore <HI>there is a Fallacy in what we &s;ay that tends to impo&s;e on the World,</HI> becau&s;e that when the &s;ame Propo|&s;al was made by others in Mr. <HI>Breck'</HI>s Name, and at his De&s;ire, you know &s;everal of tho&s;e Gentlemen manife&s;ted their Di&s;like of it, and would not give their Con&s;ent</Q>.

<P>With re&s;pect to our <HI>third</HI> Rea&s;on, <HI>viz.</HI> That tho&s;e three Elders that belong to this County, that &s;at in Coun|cil as Judges of this Ca&s;e, they each of them had once before, openly in A&s;&s;ociation given their Judgment, and upon a formal Con&s;ideration, and where the Matter was particularly di&s;cu&s;s'd and debated, declared it to be their Judgment that Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> &s;tood already &s;ufficiently clear, with regard to tho&s;e Things that had been alled|ged again&s;t him; and that all the neighbouring Mini&s;ters that had &s;u&s;pended their Judgment, were &s;et a&s;ide as pre|judiced, and tho&s;e only that had actually given their Judgment already were employed becau&s;e free from Prejudice.

<P>With re&s;pect to our <HI>fourth</HI> Rea&s;on, <HI>viz.</HI> That all the Council were cho&s;en by tho&s;e that were a <HI>Party in the Ca&s;e:</HI> The Sum of your An&s;wer is, that it is a new Thing that &s;o great a Majority of a Church are called a <HI>Party,</HI> on which you make a great Harrangue. Here we would ob&s;erve, the whole Argument that you pretend to an|&s;wer is entirely &s;lip'd over, and not in the lea&s;t touch'd, and only a vain Di&s;pute rais'd that don't concern the Ar|gument at all, about the proper Application of the Word <HI>Party:</HI> When we &s;ay <HI>they had made them&s;elves a Party with Mr.</HI> Breck <HI>in the Ca&s;e;</HI> the plain and ob|vious Meaning of it is, that they had &s;o &s;ided and united

them&s;elves to Mr. <HI>Breck,</HI> that they were become one with him in this Cau&s;e, or that his Cau&s;e was become their Cau&s;e; &s;o that they became <HI>one Side</HI> concerned in the Cau&s;e that was to be judged, or one of tho&s;e <HI>two Sides</HI> or <HI>Parts</HI> that you undertook to judge between: The <HI>minor Part</HI> of the Church had Articles of Charge to exhibit again&s;t the <HI>major Part,</HI> as they declared to you in their Letter, Page 45 of the Narrative. Com|monly when there is a Cau&s;e to be judged between two, either <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> or <HI>Companies,</HI> we &s;ay they are the <HI>two Parties</HI> concerned&punc; and when it is &s;o, and the Judica|ture is elective, we &s;till &s;ay it is contrary to the Light of Nature, that one Party or Side &s;hould chu&s;e all the Judges: And it is perfectly wide from the Bu&s;ine&s;s, whether you allow the Word <HI>Party</HI> to be proper or no, if they being one of tho&s;e two Sides between whom Judgment is to be made, if they chu&s;e all the Judges, the other Side, equally concern'd with them&s;elves, tho' they are &s;maller and weaker, are oppre&s;&s;ed and depri|ved of their Right; and if any Scheme of Di&s;cipline gives them Power to chu&s;e all the Judges, we &s;till <HI>&s;ay,</HI> and every one <HI>mu&s;t &s;ay,</HI> that 'tis <HI>built on the Ruins of the common Rights of Mankind.</HI></P>
<P>You appeared there in a two fold Capacity; you did not appear only as Ordainers, but as Judges of a parti|cular Cau&s;e depending between the major Part of the Church and the Minor: You your&s;elf declare, Page 47, that this was the Bu&s;ine&s;s you came upon, <HI>to hear and judge of what might be objected:</HI> And how much &s;oever the Part you &s;uppo&s;e that called you was the major Part, and how much Power &s;oever you &s;uppo&s;e the major Part to have over the Minor, it don't alter the Force of the Argument.</P>

<P>With re&s;pect to our <HI>fifth</HI> Rea&s;on, <HI>viz</HI> That the major Part of the Council was cho&s;en by Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> him&s;elf:
<PB N="34" REF="004152_0037_1003E014F5E12AC8">

<P>You next proceed to con&s;ider our <HI>&s;ixth</HI> Rea&s;on, <HI>viz.</HI> That the major Part of the Council were not regularly called, even according to your own Principles, and that becau&s;e the Churches you belonged to were never ap|plied to by <HI>Springfield</HI> Church.

one's Memory, and all other collateral Evidences? But you &s;ay, <HI>The Church cho&s;e a Committee to manage the Affairs re&s;pecting the Ordination, and that one nece&s;&s;ary Affair for which they were cho&s;en was to &s;ign Letters to the &s;eve|ral Churches, of which tho&s;e Elders were the Pa&s;tors.</HI> Of which, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> we would enquire, how you know that this is <HI>one Affair for which they were cho&s;en?</HI> There is no Account or Hint of any &s;uch thing in their Votes. <HI>Secondly,</HI> If the Church did chu&s;e them to <HI>&s;ign Letters,</HI> they cho&s;e 'em to &s;ign Letters without any Direction <HI>who to &s;ign them to;</HI> for the Churches were not cho&s;en by the Church meeting: And if you &s;ay that the Church meant to give this Committee Power to chu&s;e for 'em; for the pre&s;ent we will &s;uppo&s;e they did mean to give 'em this Power. This, we humbly conceive, by congre|gational Principles, is what they could not do: A Church indeed may chu&s;e a Committee to con&s;ider Things, and make Report; but their Determinations are not Acts of the Church till reported to the Church and made their own by them&s;elves: A Church may al&s;o chu&s;e a Committee to execute their Acts, as to &s;ign Letters in the Name of the Church; but then it mu&s;t fir&s;t <HI>be the Act of the Church,</HI> before they can execute it: The Bu&s;ine&s;s of a Committee is not to <HI>make Acts them|&s;elves,</HI> and when they have done <HI>execute their own Acts,</HI> that never have been pa&s;&s;ed by the Church. The Church by congregational Principles, we conceive, can|not &s;o give up their Power of Election in any one In|&s;tance, into the Hands of particular Per&s;ons, therein con|&s;tituting them their Officers, to exercise for 'em a Power that is originally in them&s;elves; and that becau&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Part of their <HI>Power of Priviledge,</HI> which by congre|gational Principles they ought to <HI>&s;tand fa&s;t in</HI> and in no In&s;tance to give up to others: The Power of Priviledge and the Power of Office, both, by congregational Prin|ciples, are originally in the Brotherhood, but with this Difference, that Chri&s;t has given them the <HI>Power of Of|fice,</HI> not to be exerci&s;ed by them&s;elves, but to be exerci|&s;ed by &s;ome particular Member, to whom they &s;hall commit their Power, &s;o con&s;tituting him their Officer,
<PB N="37" REF="004152_0040_1003E0DE5A25F458">
to exerci&s;e this Power for them: But the <HI>Power of Pri|viledge</HI> is &s;o given them by Chri&s;t <HI>to be in them formally and immediately &s;o as it may be exercis'd by themselves,</HI> as is evident by the Platform, Chap. V. Sect. II. But when once they have given it away, tho' it be but in one In&s;tance, it cea&s;es to be in them, in that In&s;tance <HI>formally and immediately,</HI> 'tis in them no otherwi&s;e than the Power of Office, and can't be <HI>exerci&s;ed immediately by them&s;elves.</HI> This <HI>Power of Priviledge</HI> therefore can ne|ver, in any Part of it, be given up to particular Per&s;ons, but ever remains with the Brotherhood; which further appears by the Platform, Chap. X. Sect. XI. <Q>From the Premi&s;es, <HI>viz</HI> That the ordinary <HI>Power of Government</HI> belonging only to the Elders, <HI>Power of Priviledge</HI> REMAINETH with the Brotherhood, as the Power of Judgment in Matters of Cen&s;ure, and Powers of Liberty in Matters of Liberty.</Q> And then this is against the Power of Priviledges, for a Church thus to give up their Power of Election in any In&s;tance to particular Per&s;ons another Way; for 'tis a Power of Priviledge that is ve&s;t|ed in every Brother to have a Hand in the Election, and one Way wherein they have a Right to have a Hand in it is, to have Liberty of offering their Objections to the re&s;t of their Brethren, again&s;t tho&s;e that are nominated before they are cho&s;en: But if the Church don't chu&s;e at all, but give away their Power to particular Per&s;ons, they will have no Opportunity for this: As in this Ca&s;e there was no Mention made in the Church-meeting, who were to be cho&s;en; and tho&s;e who would have objected had no Opportunity for it. But then, <HI>Thirdly,</HI> Nothing can be more plain and manife&s;t, than that it never was what the Church meant, to give that Com|mittee Power to chu&s;e for them; 'tis utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with their own Votes; becau&s;e 'tis mo&s;t plainly implied in tho&s;e Votes, that they give that Power to &s;ome Body el&s;e that did not yet belong to their Church, <HI>viz</HI> to Mr. <HI>Breck:</HI> for tho' there is nothing in their Votes mention'd about the Committee's chu&s;ing Churches, yet there is this Vote relating to Mr. <HI>Breck,</HI> that we will repeat again <HI>Mr.</HI> John Burt <HI>cho&s;en to go to</HI> Bo&s;ton <HI>as a Me&s;&s;enger to

<P>Now, Sir, we would ask you whether or no this does not fully and plainly imply, that the Church left it with Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> to chu&s;e the Elders out of the County that were to ordain him? And whether therefore this Vote did not limit the Committee to Mr. <HI>Breck'</HI>s Choice? And whether their being limited <HI>to the Choice of another,</HI> is not incon&s;i&s;tent with its being left to <HI>their Choice?</HI> And whether it being &s;o that the Church never cho&s;e you them&s;elves, nor ever gave the Committee Power to chu&s;e you in their Names, that it will not follow that the Church never cho&s;e you in any Sen&s;e what&s;oever? The Matter is &s;o plain that it &s;eems to be meer Wa&s;te of Words to di&s;pute about it, &amp; would be &s;o indeed, were the Ob&s;tacles, in the Way of Conviction, but ordinary. If there be any other Way of a Churches chu&s;ing, be&s;ides doing it by them&s;elves, it mu&s;t be chu&s;ing by a Com|mittee that they have impowered to chu&s;e for them, and in their Names; but neither of the&s;e, we have now &s;hown, ever was in this Ca&s;e, unle&s;s Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> was their Committee, which you &s;trenuou&s;ly deny, Page 41, and bring Arguments to prove that he was not, which you &s;uppo&s;e in Oppo&s;ition to us, ju&s;t as if we, when we &s;aid they made Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> their Committee, intended that the Church had formally pa&s;&s;ed a Vote, wherein they had u&s;ed the Expre&s;&s;ion, and had in Terms voted that <HI>he &s;hould be their Committee.</HI> We don't deny but that Mr. <HI>Breck'</HI>s nominating your Churches, might have been con&s;i&s;tent with your being cho&s;en by the Church, if he had only <HI>nominated to the Church,</HI> and the Church had then voted according to his <HI>Nominations;</HI> but in&s;tead of this he was left to nominate and chu&s;e too; his Nomi|nation (if you will &s;o call it) was after the Church-meeting was broke up, and was never brought to any Church-meeting at all, to &s;ee whether the Church would vote it or not: So that you was not cho&s;en by the Church <HI>before you came,</HI> and therefore <HI>run before you was called;</HI> and you &s;trenuou&s;ly deny, your&s;elf, Page 43, that you was accepted as a Council, by any Vote of the Church <HI>after you came.</HI> You make a Sppo&s;ition, Page 44, that

<P>With re&s;pect to our &s;aying that the Church never vo|ted, to de&s;ire the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of any Church at all, but only certain Presbyters by Name; you &s;ay they <Q>cho&s;e four of the Elders, that with the Churches, they de&s;i|red to a&s;&s;i&s;t, thinking the Churches were &s;ufficiently di&s;tingui&s;hed by naming their Elders.</Q> What <HI>we</HI> ar|gue from is what was publickly acted, voted, and re|corded; but what <HI>you</HI> argue from is what they thought in the &s;ecret Clo&s;et of their Hearts: If that be according to congregational Principles, to make a Churches unde|clared Thoughts the Foundation of other Churches Acts, we confe&s;s it is as you &s;ay, Page 44, 45, That we <HI>have no thorough Acquaintance with congregational Principles:</HI> What is mo&s;t probable is, that the Church, being igno|rant of congregational Principles, thought nothing about applying to any Churches, and did not know that there was any Need of it: And tho' you &s;ay it &s;hews our Ig|norance of tho&s;e Principles, if we &s;uppo&s;e, that in ca&s;e <HI>Springfield</HI> Church had only de&s;ired the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of certain Elders by Name, and tho&s;e Elders with the Con|&s;ent of their Churches, had come to ordain, it would not have been agreeable to tho&s;e Principles: but in this Matter, Rev.

Mi&s;&s;ion from his Church, but his Church has no Power to concern them&s;elves in the Affairs of another Church, or to give any one a Mi&s;&s;ion to act in them, till applied to by that Church: All the Acts of other Churches, as well as Per&s;ons, as concerning them&s;elves in the Affairs of that Church, are, by the Tenour of your own Words <HI>null and void,</HI> if not applied to, and called by that Church: An Application to a particular Per&s;on don't give a Church Authority to act; the Delegate goes as the Churches Repre&s;entative, &amp; all that he acts is in the Name of his Church, and not by any Power of his Office as an Elder, which extends not beyond the Limits of his own Congregation; in his <HI>coming</HI> the Church <HI>comes,</HI> and there|fore, however <HI>he</HI> has been <HI>called</HI> per&s;onally, yet if the Church han't been applied to, the Church comes <HI>uncalled:</HI> It 'don't at all follow that it is not &s;o, becau&s;e the Platform &s;ays they may improve Elders of other Churches, as you mention; there the Platform meddles not with the Way of their being called; the Platform &s;uppo&s;es that to be determined el&s;ewhere.

<P>When I was at <HI>Springfield</HI> in <HI>October</HI> 1735, the ordi|nation Council then being there; the Evening after Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> was apprehended, I, and the other Wit|ne&s;&s;es, who went to te&s;tify in Mr. <HI>Breck'</HI>s Favour, were de&s;ired by the Council to write our Evidences that Night; and produce them before the Council the next Morning, which we did, and carried them to the Council; the Rev.

The Man went away immediately, I &s;uppo&s;e to give Notice, and while they waited for the coming of the People, &s;ome Body &s;aid in the Council Chamber, there will not be Room in the other Chamber for the People that will come, would it not be be&s;t to read them fir&s;t in the other Chamber to the Church; and to read them abroad to the People when they are gathered toge|ther? Mr. <HI>Cooper</HI> an&s;wered, very well, I believe it will be be&s;t to do &s;o.

<P>Whether you ordered that Circum&s;tance of the read|ing tho&s;e Te&s;timonies, <HI>viz.</HI> its being done on Hor&s;e-back or no, yet by this, the reading of them <HI>in &s;o publick a Manner,</HI> as that it &s;hould be done <HI>before both the Church and others,</HI> was by your Advice.

<P>And be&s;ides, in Page 82, you your &s;elf allow two of tho&s;e Gentlemen to be <HI>Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel, of an e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd Character &amp; Reputation,</HI> and &s;ay you <HI>gave Credit to their Te&s;timonies</HI> as &s;uch, and yet advi&s;e to the publick rea|ding of Declarations of &s;ome Per&s;ons, to repre&s;ent them to be Liars: What End could you have in this?

<P>You &s;ay, Page 69, that it makes it look &s;till wor&s;e in us, that we &s;hould mention this young Gentleman's reading tho&s;e Te&s;timonies, to repre&s;ent Mr. <HI>Kirtland</HI> and Mr. <HI>Clap</HI> to be Liars, that the&s;e Gentlemen notwith|&s;tanding, a Week or two after, a&s;&s;i&s;ted in his Ordina|tion. 'Tis true, tho&s;e reverend Mini&s;ters, tho' &s;o abu&s;ed by this young Gentleman, did exerci&s;e an admirable Spirit of Meekne&s;s in this Affair; for &s;ome of the Peo|ple that he was &s;ettling among&s;t were exceedingly di&s;|gu&s;ted at it.

<PB N="59" REF="004152_0062_1003E195C6747740">
and to pacify them towards him. And when he was di&s;|cour&s;ed with about it he did not ju&s;tify what he had done; and tho&s;e Gentlemen a&s;&s;i&s;ted in his Ordination. And we can't &s;ee that their Moderation and good Temper in <HI>&s;o ea&s;ily</HI> pa&s;&s;ing over the <HI>Injury,</HI> can reflect any Blame upon us, for reciting a Fact &s;o publickly tran&s;acted.</P>
<P>Whereas we &s;peak of it, in our Defence, as a Thing that &s;hews the Prejudice and Violence of the Gentlemen of <HI>that Party,</HI> that they intercepted, broke open, and publi&s;hed in the <HI>Gazette,</HI> a private Letter of a Per&s;on of Di&s;tinction to his Friend (meaning a Letter of the Rev. Rector of <HI>Yale College</HI> to Mr. <HI>W</HI>&mdash;<HI>ms</HI> of <HI>Long Meadow</HI>) you &s;ay that <HI>this needs want, as many of our Stories un|happily do, the needful Circum&s;tances of Truth</HI> because <HI>none of you of the Council</HI> ever intercepted it, or broke it open; but if it be &s;o, is that an Evidence that <HI>none of the Party</HI> did it.</P>
<P>We u&s;ed the Word <HI>Party</HI> here, and not <HI>Council,</HI> for that very End that it might take in, both the Intercepter and the Publi&s;her. You &s;ay you <HI>had not the lea&s;t Thought of its being intercepted or broken open, till the Narrative told</HI> you <HI>of it:</HI> If it be &s;o, 'tis very &s;trange; you were long before that told of it in the <HI>Boston Gazette</HI> of <HI>Decemb.</HI> I. wherein the Injuriou&s;ne&s;s of expo&s;ing a Letter &s;o &s;tolen, was in&s;i&s;ted on. But if it was &s;o, and was as you <HI>&s;olemnly declare, that not one of you knew from whom nor by whom it came,</HI> certainly then you ought not to have expo&s;ed it as the Rector's, to his Reproach; for if the Ca&s;e was &s;o, you knew not but that it was a meer Forgery. Why would you &s;uffer your Hands to touch Goods that were brought to you after &s;uch a Manner, that you knew were none of your own, but &s;aw that they came with another Man's Mark upon them, as the original Owner, and knew not how they were gotten from him? Was it wor|thy of a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel, under &s;uch Circum&s;tances, before ever he knew, or had made any Enquiry, to take them into his Hou&s;e, and into his own Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and improve them to his own Purpo&s;es, and to the Prejudice of the original Owner? Is this, Rev. Sir, becoming of your Office and Character? But you &s;ay that you never
<PB N="60" REF="004152_0063_1003E1151C84B090">
publi&s;hed it, &amp; then, to prove it, you in&s;ert an Extract of that Part of the <HI>Bo&s;ton Gazette</HI> that was referred to, whereby it appears that only &s;ome Parts of the Letter were publi&s;hed, with Inter&s;pers'd Reflections, publickly to ridicule it: But is not this a mi&s;erable Foundation to cry out of Un|truth upon? 'Tis true you did not till now publi&s;h the whole Letter, but han't you expos'd the Letter, and a|bu&s;ed the Author <HI>in Publick</HI> in a greater Degree, than if you had meerly done that? You have picked out &s;ome particular Parts of the Letter, that you &s;uppo&s;ed mo&s;t for your Purpo&s;e of rendring the Author ridiculous in the Eye of the World, and have not only publi&s;hed, but in a fleering in&s;ulting Manner, derided and di&s;canted on tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages: The Fact that you have been guilty of, is the &s;ame in Kind and Denomination with what we have charged you with; tho&s;e of that Party han't only intercepted and broke open, but al&s;o publi&s;hed in the <HI>Gazette.</HI> If a Company or Set of Men, made up of &s;ome that had &s;tolen a Parcel of Goods, &amp; others that were Par|takers with them, &s;hould be di&s;covered in &s;elling of them, and &s;ome Body &s;hould &s;ay the Company were guilty, not only of &s;tealing but &s;elling the &s;tolen Goods, would it not be thought ridiculous in them, to cry out of Slander and a <HI>Breach of the ninth Command|ment,</HI> on no better Pretence than only that they had not yet sold 'em all? You &s;eem to de&s;ire that it &s;hould be much taken Notice of by your Readers, that we &s;ay that therein the Gentlemen <HI>of the Party</HI> have done that in the Face of the World as glorying in it, which common Knaves and Ru&s;&s;ians, when they do, do privately, and keep &s;ecret, as being a&s;hamed of it: As we &s;aid then, &s;o we &s;ay now, and appeal to all Gentlemen and all Chri&s;|tians, whether or no it be any Thing more than a ju&s;t Reflection? Or, whether the Expre&s;&s;ions are at all har&s;h for &s;uch an Act? You your&s;elf acknowledge <HI>&s;uch an Act de&s;erves to be had in Dete&s;tation and Abhorrence:</HI> And tho' we did not charge it on any of the Council then, yet while you are declaming again&s;t us for charging you with it, you immediately &s;hew us and the World, that you are not afraid nor a&s;hamed to have it true of you;
<PB N="61" REF="004152_0064_1003BBA654F5E7E0">
but do it in the Face of the World, and glory in it now, when you do fully know it to be a &s;tolen Letter. You &s;eem to pretend that you publi&s;h it in your own Vindi|cation, to &s;how the World that all of it was not contain'd in the <HI>Gazette,</HI> wherein we &s;ay it was publi&s;h'd; and may perhaps be ready to ju&s;tify your&s;elf with that, <HI>viz.</HI> That we, by abu&s;ively repre&s;enting that you had pub|li&s;hed the Letter, made it needful for you to publi&s;h it, to &s;how that you had not: But &s;uppo&s;ing we have herein abu&s;ed you, does that give you Warrant &s;o greatly to abu&s;e another Man, that was not concerned in that Abu&s;e? Suppo&s;ing the Author of that Letter him&s;elf, had by &s;ome injurious Reproaches ca&s;t on you, rendred it need|ful that the Letter &s;hould be publi&s;hed in your Vindi|cation, tho' to his Di&s;grace; yet, will your taking this Advantage agree with your &s;evere and bitter Charges of us for publi&s;hing Mr. <HI>Clap'</HI>s Te&s;timony, that was not &s;tolen, but our own (wherein was &s;omething to Mr. <HI>B</HI>&mdash;<HI>k'</HI>s Di&s;credit) which was done upon a like Rea|&s;on?</P>
<P>But the Mi&s;repre&s;entation and Abu&s;e you pretend, that you publi&s;h the Letter to vindicate your&s;elf from, is ours and not his, which renders the Thing much more aggra|vated: You own that the intercepting and opening a private Letter is a <HI>dete&s;table Thing;</HI> but certainly the publi&s;hing &s;uch a Letter to the World, when you know it to be &s;uch a one, is <HI>more dete&s;table:</HI> Wherein con&s;i&s;ts the Di&s;hone&s;ty of a Per&s;on's breaking &s;uch a Letter open, but that thereby he makes it known to <HI>one</HI> that had no Right to know it, and that the Author did not de&s;ign &s;hould know it? But he that publi&s;hes it, don't only make it known to <HI>one</HI> that had no Right to know it, but to <HI>Hundreds,</HI> he expo&s;es it to <HI>the World.</HI></P>
<P>And be&s;ides, you &s;ay, Page 70, That every Man of you do <HI>&s;olemnly declare, to all that will give you the Credit of Men of common Hone&s;ty and Truth, that a Copy of a certain Letter was brought to</HI> Bo&s;ton, <HI>but not one of you knows from whom, or by whom it came:</HI> So that you knew not who took the Copy, whether he was a faithful Per|&s;on or no, and how often it was tran&s;cribed, nor how
<PB N="62" REF="004152_0065_1003E11937830770">
much it was altered and corrupted, nor how much the Author is abu&s;ed in the Copy; and yet you venture to publi&s;h it as his, on purpo&s;e to render him contemptible, introducing it with &s;uch a Flear as this, <HI>as they &s;ay it came from a Per&s;on of Di&s;tinction, &s;o we judge it to be a Letter of Di&s;tinction:</HI> And indeed the Author is exceedingly abu&s;ed in the Copy, it being fal&s;e in no le&s;s than thirteen Places; and there are &s;ome very great Errors in it: If you exerci&s;ed Rea&s;on, you could not but be &s;en&s;ible that it was not a true Copy; for tho' you often Laugh at our calling the Author a <HI>Per&s;on of Di&s;tinction,</HI> yet you mu&s;t think that he knows how to write better Engli&s;h than that Copy, which in &s;ome Part of it is gro&s;s Non&s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus, Rev. Sir, you are plea&s;ed to vaunt your&s;elf, and glory before the World, in &s;uch an Abu&s;e of your fel|low Creatures and Brethren, and Violation of all Ho|nour and Ju&s;tice, that you may have the Glory of &s;triking the harde&s;t Blows.</P>
<P>In Page 75, 76, you &s;ay, with Re&s;pect to this Rev.

Is it not this, <HI>viz.</HI> That if the Rector's being there, nor his Conduct there, was indeed not blameable, why do we, when we heard he was blamed, go to &s;how that he was not blameable? But then in the following Lines of the 76th Page, you undertake to &s;how wherein it was blameable; and in or|der to that you &s;ay, in Line 5, 6, and 7, <Q>He might, and no Doubt did, make a Vi&s;it to his Rev. Father at <HI>Hat|field,</HI> but we know great Part of his Time was &s;pent at <HI>Northampton</HI> and <HI>Springfield.</HI></Q> Here it is in&s;inuated, that he &s;pent con&s;iderable Time at <HI>Northampton</HI> with the Ju&s;tices: We &s;uppo&s;e you ventured upon this on meer Conjecture; for in truth he rarely has &s;pent &s;o little Time among his Relations at <HI>Northampton</HI> when he came into this Part of the Country, and &s;aw but one of the Ju&s;tices, <HI>viz</HI> his Uncle <HI>Stoddard,</HI> with whom he &s;pent but about half an Hour.

Rector declares that there was no &s;uch Thing in Fact, and the Gentleman you direct to enquire of declares him&s;elf abu&s;ed, and that he has given no Foundation for you to in&s;inuate as if there was.

and thereby greatly &s;tumbled many People: And is there nothing of the Nature of Scandal in all this?

Page 58, Mr. <HI>B</HI>&mdash;&s;aid, Faith in Chri&s;t was not in its own Nature nece&s;&s;ary to Salva|tion; and that all that was nece&s;&s;ary in order to that End, was that Men &s;hould for&s;ake Sin and lead moral Lives; and this Men might do meerly out of Love to Vertue it&s;elf; and if Men did but attain the End, it was no Matter what Motive they acted upon; and &s;aid he, <HI>Ma&s;ter Chubb</HI> brings a very ingenious Compari&s;on to illu&s;trate it; and he took down the Book and turned the Place to me, and I read the Compari&s;on, which was after this Manner; Suppo&s;e there were a Company of Men in a Hou&s;e, and &s;ome Per&s;on &s;hould come in and tell them that this Hou&s;e would fall in two Hours, and that they &s;hould be all killed if they did not go out of it; now it may be &s;ome might believe what this Man &s;aid; and yet for &s;ome Rea&s;ons might &s;tay in the Hou&s;e: Others might not believe what the Man &s;aid; and yet for &s;ome Rea&s;ons might go out of the Hou&s;e: And &s;uppo&s;e that the Hou&s;e &s;hould fall at the

two Hours End, it would not be their believing what this Man &s;aid that would &s;ave their Lives, but their going out of the Hou&s;e, and if they went out of the Hou&s;e their Lives would be &s;aved, whether they believed what this Man &s;aid or no, &s;o (<HI>Chubb</HI> &s;aid) it was not Men's be|lieving any Thing Chri&s;t or his Apo&s;tles &s;aid that would &s;ave them, but their living moral Lives; for if they did &s;o the whole End and De&s;ign of Chri&s;t's com|ing into the World would be an&s;wered; and they &s;hould be &s;aved whether ever they heard or believed any Thing about Chri&s;t or not.</Q></P>
<P>Me&s;&s;i <HI>Nathaniel Wales, Jonathan Bingham, Ralph Wheelock, Jabez Huntington,</HI> and <HI>John Bachus,</HI> jun. all jointly te&s;tified, Page 48, <Q>That they heard Mr. <HI>B</HI>&mdash;in depreciating Faith in Chri&s;t, and &s;aying that GOD was not plea&s;ed nor di&s;plea&s;ed with any Man for be|lieving or disbelieving, deliver the &s;ame Compari&s;on in Mr. <HI>Clap'</HI>s Pulpit, which he &s;hew'd to Mr <HI>Clap</HI> in <HI>Chubb,</HI> which he mention'd there as what he took out of an ingenious Author.</Q></P>

by the Tenour of his Conver&s;ation and Preaching there.</HI> In this you are mi&s;taken, for he &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in &s;ome of the &s;am-erroneous Opinions; and particularly that, that the Heathen might he &s;aved without Faith in Chri&s;t, Nar. Page 7, 8.

And he told one of us, <HI>viz</HI> Mr. <HI>Hopkins,</HI> that he did not depart from any thing that ever he had preached at <HI>Windham;</HI> as is related Page 15 of the Nar|rative: And this he held till he &s;ee it would not do to hold it any longer, and then at la&s;t pretends that he has received better Light than he had at <HI>Windham.</HI></P>
<P>In Page 94, you mi&s;repre&s;ent what he &s;aid before the A&s;&s;ociation, about his charging Mr <HI>Clap</HI> with lying, <HI>viz. That he &s;aid he was very &s;orry he expre&s;s'd him&s;elf in &s;o ha&s;ty and indecent a Manner; but he mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t upon it that in what Mr</HI> Clap <HI>&s;aid of him he was wronged.</HI> You was not there as we were: What he indeed &s;aid there was this, <HI>viz.</HI> That <HI>he might have u&s;ed other Terms, but the Thing that he a&s;&s;erted was true.</HI></P>
<P>In the Conclu&s;ion of your Book, you put up a very &s;olemn Prayer to GOD, wherein you make u&s;e of the Words of Chri&s;t ju&s;t before his Crucifixion, that we may be all united in Love and Peace: With re&s;pect to which we would pray you to con&s;ider how that Prayer &s;uits with your Treatment of your Brethren in the Mini&s;try, and others, and particularly in that Book. Certainly it is not very decent for a Man while he is trampling on his Neighbour, with flearing Taunts and Deri&s;ion, at the &s;ame Time to put up a Prayer to GOD, in the mo&s;t &s;o|lemn Expre&s;&s;ions, that he and that Man may be united in Love and chri&s;tian Charity.

<P>Thus, Rev.

Tho' now po&s;&s;ibly your Heat of Spirit, and Contempt of us, may forbid any Self-reflections; yet will it always be a Comfort to you, to think that you have obtained the Victory and got your Will in this Ca&s;e, and have been the In&s;trument of rendring the religious State of this County, that before always flouri&s;hed in an undi&s;turbed and happy Union, our religious Affairs being, with Peace and Love, &amp; general Con&s;ent, managed within our&s;elves?

Sir, try who can conquer at Scoff and Jeer, but let our Arguments fight it out; not that we glory in the Strength of our own Rea&s;on, but we glory in the Goodne&s;s of our Cau&s;e, which, we hum|bly conceive affords good Argument, and therefore &s;uch as are not liable to a ju&s;t An&s;wer. <HI>Secondly,</HI> If you think you have Arguments from the Nature of the Ca&s;e, &s;ufficient of them&s;elves to &s;upport your Cau&s;e, we would pray you not to in&s;i&s;t on the Vote of the Hou&s;e of Re|pre&s;entatives, or the Judgment of any Per&s;ons or Num|ber of Per&s;ons what&s;oever: We hope we don't fail of any due Honour to the honourable Hou&s;e of Repre&s;en|tatives; but might have many Things to &s;ay concerning that Vote, if it were to the Purpo&s;e for us to enter into Debate about it. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> If you pretend to give an An&s;wer to the Arguments we in this Letter have in&s;i&s;ted on, we would pray you not to &s;lide over and pa&s;s by that which we evidently intend as the main Force and Spirit of the Argument; but meet the Argument in its proper Cour&s;e, and encounter it there where we evi|dently lay the greate&s;t Stre&s;s. <HI>Fourthly,</HI> That you would not publi&s;h Things to the World to do &s;ame us, and ren|der us odious and contemptible, on no other Foundation
<PB N="84" REF="004152_0087_1003E169DC3F0C70">
than Hear&s;ay and flying Report. <HI>Fifthly,</HI> If you don't &s;ee Cau&s;e to an&s;wer the&s;e foregoing Reque&s;ts, that you would at lea&s;t &s;hew wherein they are not rea&s;onable, or what we may ju&s;tly make and expect your Com|pliance with.</P>
<P>We leave it with you, Rev. Sir, to judge whether the&s;e Reque&s;ts are rea&s;onable or not; and are willing to leave the whole Affair to your own Con&s;cience, if you will let it &s;peak its own Words: and leaving what we have now written for you to con&s;ider of, and beg|ging of GOD that he would a&s;&s;i&s;t both you and us to what is our Duty to do.</P>
<P>We remain, <HI>Rev.</HI> Sir, your Brethren in the &s;ame great and &s;acred Work, that we are called to by the &s;ame Lord Je&s;us, the <HI>Lamb of GOD.</HI></P>
