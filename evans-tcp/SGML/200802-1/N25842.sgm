<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>AS the dealings of the Almighty with me from my youth have been &s;ingular, and are worthy to be retained in remembrance with thankfulne&s;s, I have committed to writing &s;ome remarkable circum&s;tances of my life; tending to awaken future thank&s;giving and watchful|ne&s;s in my&s;elf; and, con&s;idering how wonder|fully the divine arm has been manife&s;ted for my help, to encourage me to a &s;teady tru&s;t therein, and per&s;everance in &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion there|to: and in order to leave to my &s;urviving re|lations, &s;ome memorials of the various exer|ci&s;es and dangers which I have pa&s;&s;ed through, and of the merciful &s;upport and pre&s;ervation vouch&s;afed from the Lord therein.</P>
<P>But fir&s;t it appears proper for me to leave a te&s;timony to my parents, who not only pro|fe&s;&s;ed the truth, but had it in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. My father, Henry Payton, of Dudley in Wor|ce&s;ter&s;hire (&s;on of John and Catherine Payton, re&s;pectable members in the &s;ociety of Friends), was called into the work of the mini&s;try about
<PB N="4" REF="034371_0003_0FFC2DA6E28D2B48">
the eighteenth year of his age; and, when young, travelled much in the &s;ervice of truth in divers parts of this nation, Ireland, and Scotland, as al&s;o in the American colonies: and from the te&s;timonies of friends, I have good rea&s;on to believe that his &s;ervice was tru|ly acceptable and edifying to the churches; his mini&s;try being lively and clear, and his care not to exceed the openings of truth there|in apparent. His deportment was grave, his conduct clean and &s;teady, and his charity, in proportion to his circum&s;tances, diffu&s;ive. He was an affectionate hu&s;band, a tender father, and kind ma&s;ter; &s;erviceable among&s;t his neigh|bours, and beloved and re&s;pected by them. Many years before his decea&s;e, he was di&s;abled not only for public &s;ervice in the mini&s;try, but for acting in the private duties of life in pro|viding for his family; being afflicted with a pa|ralytic di&s;order, under which his faculties gra|dually gave way. I was much his companion in his long weakne&s;s, reading to him and attend|ing upon him; and can give this te&s;timony re|&s;pecting him, that he retained the favour of the divine life to the la&s;t; and frequently ma|nife&s;ted a religious concern for his children, and particularly for me, his younge&s;t child and tenderly beloved by him. He would of|ten &s;ay, 'The Lord ble&s;s you my children,' when his &s;peech faltered &s;o that he could arti|culate but little. In the &s;eventy-fifth year of his age he was relea&s;ed from his affliction, and I doubt not is entered into everla&s;ting bli&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="034371_0004_0FFC2DA557198F18">My mother was the daughter of Henry and Elizabeth Fowler, of Eve&s;ham in Worce&s;ter|&s;hire. She was a religious woman, endued with a &s;trong and &s;teady under&s;tanding, and many and &s;ingular virtues whereby &s;he was fitted for the part &s;he had to act in life. This was peculiarly exerci&s;ing in part, through my father's incapacity for bu&s;ine&s;s, the care of a pretty large and young family, and a con&s;ider|able bu&s;ine&s;s (and that not of the kind the mo&s;t fit for a woman) devolving upon her. When my father was di&s;abled from acting for his family, being engaged in a partner&s;hip in one branch of bu&s;ine&s;s which terminated in great lo&s;s of property, his affairs were in a very un&s;ettled &s;tate; all which, with other very trying circum&s;tances, my mother pa&s;&s;ed through with admirable &s;teadine&s;s, fortitude, and patience; and through a long &s;eries of nece&s;&s;ary worldly engagements, &s;he was fa|voured to retain the be&s;t life. The Lord greatly ble&s;&s;ed her endeavours for her chil|dren, in temporals; and I doubt not heard her prayers that the dew of heaven might re&s;t upon them. She would &s;ay, &s;he de&s;ired not great riches for her children, but that they might dwell in the fear of God. Her &s;teady and &s;trong conjugal affection was mani|fe&s;ted in my father's long indi&s;po&s;ition, by ten|der attention; and after his decea&s;e, by her frequent mentioning him in terms which evin|ced that their union was founded in that love, which death cannot di&s;&s;olve. She &s;aid that
<PB N="6" REF="034371_0005_0FFC2DA2DE174328">
when &s;he married him, &s;he was &s;o far from being intimidated at the thought of his leav|ing her, to travel in his mini&s;terial office, that &s;he entered the &s;olemn covenant, with a re|&s;olution to do her utmo&s;t to &s;et him at liberty therein; and when it plea&s;ed Divine Wi&s;dom to deprive her of a hu&s;band whom &s;he might of|fer up to his &s;ervice, &s;he was de&s;irous that &s;ome one at lea&s;t of her offspring might be called to the mini&s;try: which was fulfilled in me, whom &s;he bore rather late in life, and tenderly loved; but, I believe &s;he as freely dedicated me to the Lord as Hannah did Samuel, and was al|ways ready to put me forward in his work; yet was weightily concerned that I might not run before my true guide. And although, af|ter I was called to the mini&s;try, it was my lot to be much ab&s;ent from her, &s;he never repined at it, but frequently encouraged and excited me to faithfulne&s;s: &s;o that among the many mercies be&s;towed by bounteous Providence, I may ju&s;tly number as not the lea&s;t, the having &s;uch a parent.</P>
<P>She was an affectionate mother to all her children, yet very quick-&s;ighted to their faults, ready to reprove them; and not &s;ub|ject to indulge them in childhood; but educat|ed them in indu&s;try. In fine, &s;he was an ex|ample of fortitude, cheerfulne&s;s, gravity, in|du&s;try, oeconomy, &s;elf-denial, and re&s;ignation to the divine will. She was generous to her friends; her hou&s;e and heart always open to receive the Lord's me&s;&s;engers: for which &s;he would &s;ay &s;he thought a ble&s;&s;ing was dropped
<PB N="7" REF="034371_0006_0FFC2D9FDE48D690">
upon her family. She was charitable to the poor; rather choo&s;ing to &s;ave from other ex|pences, that &s;he might have to di&s;pen&s;e. She died in the ninety-fir&s;t year of her age; and retained a con&s;iderable degree of &s;oundne&s;s of judgment until near the clo&s;e of a u&s;eful, but careful life.</P>
<P>Thus de&s;cended, it may be &s;uppo&s;ed I was in the way to receive religious in&s;truction from my infancy; and indeed I cannot date the fir&s;t dawn of divine light upon my &s;oul; for with humble thankfulne&s;s I may &s;ay, that early in the morning of life I knew the Lord to be a God nigh at hand; convincing of evil, and rai&s;ing breathings after the &s;aving knowledge of his divine love and power. Friends who travelled in the mini&s;try u&s;ually lodged at my father's hou&s;e. I loved their company when but very young, and their tender notice of me I commemorate with gratitude. And here I remark, that if our youth prized the favour of the company and conver&s;e of &s;uch who&s;e "feet appear beautiful upon the mountains of &s;alvation, and who have had large experi|ence of the love of God, they might profit much thereby.&mdash;But, alas! how often do &s;ome avoid their company, &s;carcely giving them an opportunity of manife&s;ting to them that tender affection, wherewith their &s;pirits are clothed; being probably afraid of reproof, on account of their indulging in liberties, contrary to the pure liberty of truth; which they think hard, although it be given in that love which &s;eeks
<PB N="8" REF="034371_0007_0FFC2D9E236A5090">
the true happine&s;s of their &s;ouls. I could read well when very young, and (as is before hint|ed) &s;pending much time with my afflicted fa|ther, I read much to him; and the experien|ces and &s;ufferings of faithful martyrs, and of our worthy friends, with the accounts of the glorious exit of &s;uch as launched out of time in full a&s;&s;urance of everla&s;ting bli&s;s, made profit|able impre&s;&s;ions upon my mind; my &s;pirit be|ing often tendered thereby, and my love of virtue and piety &s;trengthened; &s;o that I may truly &s;ay that &s;uch holy per&s;ons,
<Q>though they are dead, yet &s;peak.</Q>
May their lan|guage be heard by the youth of the pre&s;ent and &s;ucceeding generations; and excite them to e&s;chew the paths of vanity, and to follow the foot&s;teps of Chri&s;t's companions. So will the &s;ong of his redeemed be theirs.</P>
<P>But, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e promi&s;ing begin|nings, as I grew up, I yielded to divers temp|tations, and was allured from the &s;implicity of truth; the evil propen&s;ities in nature getting the a&s;cendency. But even in my childhood I experienced many conflicts, and my convictions for evil were &s;trong; &s;o that at times my heart was &s;orrowful, and my pillow watered with my tears, although my countenance and de|portment were mo&s;tly cheerful. Once, having yielded to temptation, my &s;en&s;e of guilt was &s;uch, that I concluded I had &s;inned again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t; and that, agreeably to Chri&s;t's te&s;ti|mony, I "&s;hould never be forgiven." This &s;o affected my tender mind with &s;orrow and un|utterable
<PB N="9" REF="034371_0008_0FFC2D9C96B51858">
di&s;tre&s;s, that it could not be entirely concealed from the family; although I was en|abled, even in childhood, to keep my exerci&s;|es of mind much to my&s;elf. I think I mu&s;t have been about eight or nine years old when it was thus with me; and as in my childhood I was &s;everal times vi&s;ited with fevers, which brought me very low, I was led to con&s;ider how I was prepared for the awful change wherewith I was threatened; and a weighty &s;en&s;e re&s;ted upon my &s;pirit, that my &s;oul was not pure enough for admittance into Chri&s;t's holy kingdom. Sometimes I would covenant with the Lord to be more circum&s;pect and watchful for the future; but the airy natural di&s;po&s;ition again got the a&s;cendency, whereby again an occa&s;ion for repentance would ari&s;e. My natural di&s;po&s;ition was very volatile, and my apprehen&s;ion quick; and as my faculties opened, I delighted much in books of a very contrary nature and tendency to tho&s;e which had engaged my attention in my childhood. I had a near relation, who, notwith&s;tanding his having been divinely favoured in his youth, had &s;lighted his &s;oul's mercies, and pur&s;ued ly|ing vanities. He kept hou&s;e in the town; and through him, my&s;elf, and my &s;i&s;ters, had opportunities of obtaining plays and romances, which I read with avidity. I al&s;o &s;pent &s;o much time at his hou&s;e as to be introduced into amu&s;e|ments very incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;implicity of truth, and my former religious impre&s;&s;ions; &s;o that my &s;tate was indeed dangerous, and but
<PB N="10" REF="034371_0009_0FFC2D986BE9DA10">
for the interpo&s;ition of Divine Providence, I had been left to pur&s;ue cour&s;es which mu&s;t have terminated deplorably. I al&s;o read hi&s;to|ry, was fond of poetry, and had a ta&s;te for philo&s;ophy; &s;o that I was in the way to em|belli&s;h my under&s;tanding (as is the common phra&s;e), and become accompli&s;hed to &s;hine in conver&s;ation; which might have tended to feed the vain proud nature, render me plea&s;ing to tho&s;e who were in it, and make me con&s;picu|ous in the world. But the Lord, in his wi&s;|dom, de&s;igned to bring me to public view in a line directly oppo&s;ite to worldly wi&s;dom, plea|&s;ure, or honour; and when he was plea&s;ed more fully to open to my under&s;tanding his great and glorious work of renovation of &s;pirit, I &s;aw that I mu&s;t de&s;i&s;t from the&s;e amu&s;ing publications and &s;tudies, and pur&s;ue the one nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s, viz. working out the &s;alva|tion of my immortal &s;oul: and I e&s;teem it a great mercy that I readily attended to this in|timation. However lawful it may be, in pro|per &s;ea&s;ons, to look into the works of nature, and become acquainted with the hi&s;tory of for|mer or pre&s;ent times, my attention was now powerfully attracted to higher &s;ubjects; and had I pur&s;ued tho&s;e lower things, I might have become as a "ve&s;&s;el marred upon the wheel." This is, alas! the ca&s;e with many who have been divinely vi&s;ited, but who, not deeply and &s;teadily attending to the in&s;tructions of pure wi&s;dom, but &s;eeking to be wi&s;e and learned; in matters which merely relate to this

pre&s;ent &s;tate, have not advanced in the &s;implici|ty of divine knowledge; and although it has re|mained obvious that the Lord's hand has merci|fully been turned upon them to form them for his &s;ervice, they have not grown up to that degree of u&s;efulne&s;s in Chri&s;t's church, whereto they might have attained, had they pa&s;&s;ively abode the turnings of his preparing hand. Were the &s;ons and daughters of our religious &s;ociety, who are favoured with good natural under|&s;tandings, clothed with heavenly wi&s;dom, they would become and appear truly great, in the dignified &s;implicity and humility of the &s;ervice of the King of kings. Human knowledge and acquirements too often puff up the minds of youth; and indeed &s;ome of more advanced age pride them&s;elves therein, when, as examples to the ri&s;ing generation, they &s;hould be cloth|ed with humility. It was ob&s;erved of a truly honourable member of our favoured &s;ociety, that 'he was a divine and a naturali&s;t, and all of the Almighty's making.'<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">William Penn's Account of George Fox.</NOTE> I have read very little on natural philo&s;ophy, and am not in a di&s;po&s;ition to boa&s;t of my acquired know|ledge, of either human, natural, or divine things; but I may &s;ay, that I have admired how by one gleam of heavenly light the under|&s;tanding is opened into natural things; &s;o as in degree to behold, as at one view, the gene|ral oeconomy of the divine Former of all things, as it is di&s;played in the outward crea|tion. This produces adoration to him under

Therefore, let not the faculties of his adopted children be &s;o improperly occupied in exploring them, as to prevent their advances in their va|rious &s;tations in his militant church: when happily their &s;ouls are fixed in the triumphant, they will know &s;o much, as for ever to in&s;pire the angelic &s;ong of
<Q>Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty, in wi&s;|dom ha&s;t thou made them all!</Q></P>
<P>From the&s;e remarks I return to my educati|on, which, whil&s;t I was at home, had not been entirely neglected, as to u&s;eful and nece&s;|&s;ary learning; yet, as through the afflicted circum&s;tances of our family, I had been kept pretty clo&s;ely there until I had attained my &s;ixteenth year, my mother concluded to &s;end me to London, and put me for one year un|der the care of Rachel Trafford, who, with her &s;i&s;ter, kept a re&s;pectable boarding-&s;chool; not doubting her attention to me, as &s;he when young had &s;pent a con&s;iderable time in my fa|ther's family: and indeed &s;he was affectionate|ly kind to me; and, as a mini&s;ter as well as mi&s;tre&s;s, I believe her mind was frequently ex|erci&s;ed for the religious improvement of her &s;cholars, which at times was manife&s;ted by verbal &s;upplication for them, as well as advice and reproof.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="034371_0012_0FFC2D914C7C26D8">I improved much for the time I &s;taid in the &s;chool, in &s;ome arts taught in it; and my &s;chool-fellows behaved well to me; but being &s;o far advanced toward maturity, tall, and proportionably grown for my age, I looked rather too much like a woman for a &s;chool; yet &s;ome of my &s;chool-fellows were older than my&s;elf, which I believe increa&s;ed my mi&s;tre&s;s's anxious &s;olicitude for our pre&s;ervation, we be|ing (to u&s;e her own expre&s;&s;ion) a &s;chool of women. I &s;oon connected my&s;elf mo&s;t inti|mately with my mi&s;tre&s;s's niece, who acted as a teacher, and with one of the &s;cholars, a &s;en&s;ible agreeable well-behaved young woman, but not of our &s;ociety, who was admitted in|to the &s;chool to qualify her&s;elf in needle-work, for a &s;chool-mi&s;tre&s;s. As neither of them were much under the influence of religion, I did not profit by their conver&s;ation, in the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential re&s;pect. But after I had been a few months in the &s;chool, I was favoured with a renewed vi&s;itation of divine love, and grew unea&s;y with my &s;ituation. Home became de|&s;irable, although I knew it to be a hou&s;e of affliction; and on my intimating it to my dear mother, my brother James fetched me there, &s;ooner than &s;he intended when I left her.</P>
<P>Thus far I have commemorated the dealings of the Almighty with my &s;oul, manife&s;ted principally in tender mercy; but now the day was coming wherein his righteous judgments were manife&s;ted again&s;t all that was high, and oppo&s;ite to his pure &s;pirit; in which day my
<PB N="14" REF="034371_0013_0FFC2D8ED8D2D3F0">
wanderings from him, the Shepherd of I&s;rael, were brought to my remembrance, and my &s;ins &s;et in order before me; which wrought great humiliation and brokenne&s;s of heart, with &s;trong cries to him, that he would graciou&s;ly pa&s;s by my tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and receive me into covenant with him&s;elf. And although this di&s;|pen&s;ation was not agreeable to degenerated na|ture, which, like Adam when he had tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ed, &s;eeks to evade the condemnation; yet, becau&s;e of the glory which I was favoured to di&s;cover beyond it, and the divine love which I &s;aw therein, I &s;aid, in the &s;ecret of my &s;oul, "It is good for me to be under it;" and I was made willing patiently to abide the judg|ments of the Lord for &s;in, in order that I might witne&s;s remi&s;&s;ion thereof through the bapti&s;m of repentance, and the &s;anctifying life or &s;pirit of his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And this mercy, in the appointed &s;ea&s;on of infinite wi&s;|dom, I experienced; &s;o that my pa&s;t tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions were blotted out of the book of re|membrance, upon the terms of my future &s;teady per&s;everance in the fear of God; and in the &s;en&s;ible exaltation of the attribute of divine mercy over judgment, my &s;oul rejoiced with humble thankfulne&s;s. Yet as when the children of I&s;rael were delivered out of Egypt, and travelled through the wilderne&s;s, they had there new trials of various kinds to encounter, in&s;omuch that they thought their &s;ufferings rather increa&s;ed than dimini&s;hed, and fre|quently feared peri&s;hing in that de&s;ert land;

&s;o, being now relieved from the oppre&s;&s;ive weight of pa&s;t actual tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and travelling after the &s;aints promi&s;&s;ed inheritance, which is a &s;tate of e&s;tabli&s;hment in righteou&s;|ne&s;s, I had to pa&s;s, to the attainment thereof, through many deep bapti&s;ms and exerci&s;es of faith and patience. I was now brought into my own heart, which, by rea&s;on of the irre|gularity of its pa&s;&s;ions and inclinations, might well be compared to an uncultivated wilder|ne&s;s; through which I mu&s;t travel, and where|in I mu&s;t receive the law for the ordering of my outward conduct: and O! the &s;ea&s;ons of hunger and thir&s;t, the to&s;&s;ings and perplexities, the "thunderings, lightnings, and tempe&s;ts," which &s;eemed to threaten de&s;truction, which I had to pa&s;s through in that day, are to be had in everla&s;ting remembrance; with thank&s;|giving to that divine hand which pre&s;erved me from being &s;o far di&s;mayed at them as to look back with a de&s;ire to return to that country, or &s;tate, from which I had hap|pily e&s;caped.

principles, which I had received by educa|tion, were called in que&s;tion; and I was left without any foundation of certainty re&s;pecting them; nor could I attain to it by the te&s;timo|ny of others, or the writings of &s;uch as had vindicated them to the world; being to re|ceive my convincement of them, from the deep ground of divine revelation.</P>
<P>All which I have &s;een was nece&s;&s;ary to fit me for the &s;ervice which was appointed me; that the foundations of my faith might be laid in certainty, and that I might be able to te&s;ti|fy with boldne&s;s, that I had experienced what I a&s;&s;erted to be the truth; and be al&s;o &s;uita|bly qualified to &s;ympathize with, and mini&s;ter to, &s;uch as were in the like &s;tates.

I was happily led to look for; and I was at length &s;trengthened to covenant with the Al|mighty, that whenever the evidence was clear and &s;trong, I would &s;ubmit thereto.</P>
<P>And here it may not be unprofitable to re|mark, that &s;ome minds are more liable to be thus affected than others. Such as have a &s;trong and quick imagination, and who&s;e hearts have been deeply affected with the exceeding &s;inful|ne&s;s of &s;in, and of the love of God to man|kind; who&s;e de&s;ires are &s;trong, that the one might come to an end, and the other abound in the earth; it is difficult for the&s;e at all times (e&s;pecially when young in religious experience) to keep the quiet habitation, wherein alone the voice of the true Shepherd is to be heard, and di&s;tingui&s;hed from that of the &s;tranger's. But as the will becomes gradually re&s;igned to that of God, and the imagination in its natural working &s;ilenced, and the &s;oul comes more con&s;tantly to wor&s;hip in the Lord's temple; the adver&s;ary in the&s;e fal&s;e appearances is bound, or if &s;uffered to pre&s;ent them, there is &s;trength acquired to &s;tand &s;till and try the &s;pirits. This I have &s;een, in the light of truth, to be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary before we move in the Lord's &s;ervice; the want of which has been productive of much confu&s;ion, and ad|mini&s;tered cau&s;e of reproach on our high and ho|ly profe&s;&s;ion, to &s;uch who are &s;eeking for an oc|ca&s;ion to lay wa&s;te the belief in divine revelation.</P>
<P>But to return:&mdash;Being come to the afore&s;aid &s;tate of re&s;ignation, I waited quietly to di&s;cern the puttings forth of the divine hand, in a &s;tate
<PB N="18" REF="034371_0018_0FFC2D8226DA1738" MS="y">
of earne&s;t prayer that I might not be &s;uffered to move before the proper time; which I have good ground to believe was heard and an&s;wer|ed; and that from the motion of divine life I was con&s;trained to &s;upplicate the Almighty in our little meeting at Dudley, the tenth day of the Second month, 1748, being then newly entered the twenty-&s;econd year of my age. May &s;uch of the Lord's children, whom he appoints to the &s;olemn important &s;ervice of the mini&s;try, humbly and patiently wait to know when to move therein; as through neglect of it &s;ome have &s;tept into it, before they have fully pa&s;&s;ed through the di&s;pen&s;ation of prepa|ration for it; and, if ever they have become &s;trong in his &s;ervice, they have continued long in a &s;tate of weakne&s;s. Yet let none de&s;pi&s;e "the day of &s;mall things." A few words &s;poken under divine direction, are often ble&s;&s;ed to tho&s;e to whom the Ma&s;ter of the &s;olemn a&s;&s;emblies directs them.</P>
<P>I continued to mini&s;ter, as the Lord was plea&s;ed to give me ability, in great brokenne&s;s of heart, and for a time in but a few words; for great fear was upon my &s;pirit le&s;t I &s;hould mini&s;ter in the wi&s;dom of the creature, which ever brings death, and begets its like: and, in a &s;en&s;e of this danger, &s;trong were my cries to the Almighty, that what I handed forth to the people might be unmixed, let it appear ever &s;o &s;imple or de&s;pi&s;able in the view of the worldly wi&s;e and learned. And as I then continued to move in fear and trembling, the
<PB N="19" REF="034371_0019_0FFC2D808708B860" MS="y">
Lord was with me, and enlarged my under|&s;tanding, and increa&s;ed my &s;ervice in the open|ings of truth: at which his people rejoiced, and, in obedience to his requirings I felt &s;weet peace. Yet was my &s;pirit frequently in hea|vine&s;s, being humbled with many deep exer|ci&s;es, which I found profitable to e&s;tabli&s;h it in righteou&s;ne&s;s, although painful to nature. And I leave it as an ob&s;ervation, that I have &s;eldom, if ever, &s;een any &s;tand, and arrive to any con&s;iderable degree of u&s;efulne&s;s in the church, who&s;e foundation have not been deeply laid in afflictions and exerci&s;es; whereby they are crucified with Chri&s;t, and &s;hall therefore ri&s;e with him to glory and honour, in the pre&s;ent as well as in a future &s;tate. But in all my afflictions and deep bapti&s;ms, the Shep|herd of I&s;rael was with me, and pre&s;erved and &s;upported my &s;pirit to the honour of his own nature, to whom alone I could attribute the prai&s;e: for in tho&s;e allotted days and years of tribulation, very little in&s;trumental help was afforded me; my lot being ca&s;t in a quarter, where there were none near who were capable of giving me much a&s;&s;i&s;tance or wi&s;e coun&s;el, not having trodden the &s;ame &s;teps. I &s;ome|times thought my ca&s;e was hidden from &s;ome of the Lord's &s;ervants, who were concerned to vi&s;it his heritage; or el&s;e that they were in part re&s;trained from mini&s;tering to it; and my tongue was much &s;ealed in &s;ilence, for my ex|erci&s;es were incommunicable.</P>
<P>All this I &s;aw to be of excellent u&s;e, as the contrary might have led to a dependance on the
<PB N="20" REF="034371_0020_0FFC2D7E22E5E620" MS="y">
&s;ervants (which ever brings weakne&s;s); or have been productive of confu&s;ion, through my imparting my ca&s;e to &s;uch as were not &s;kilful to mini&s;ter to it, and who neverthele&s;s might have advi&s;ed therein. I have &s;een it to be profitable and nece&s;&s;ary for &s;uch as are in a &s;tate of infancy in religion, to dwell with their exerci&s;es; leaning &s;imply on that arm, which alone is able to carry through them; and, un|til the mind has acquired a depth of judgment to di&s;tingui&s;h clearly who is on the Lord's &s;ide, to be very cautious to whom they communi|cate them; le&s;t they be wounded, by di&s;co|vering tho&s;e, whom they have cho&s;en for their friends, to be enemies to the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t. Yet when the Lord directs, in times of great &s;trait, to advi&s;e with &s;ome experienced &s;ervant, it will undoubtedly be advantageous; and a &s;teady &s;ympathizing friend is a great &s;trength and ble&s;&s;ing, when it is afforded in divine wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>I am inclined to clo&s;e this chapter with a lit|tle poem, which I wrote in my nineteenth year; as it has been handed about in manu&s;cript, and &s;uffered much by copying. It is even in print, and one whole ver&s;e omitted. Between my eighteenth and twenty-&s;econd year I penned &s;everal &s;mall tracts, all of a religious nature; but &s;oon after I appeared in the mini&s;try, I dropped my pen in regard to ver&s;es. I do not &s;ay it was a &s;acrifice required; but the conti|nuing of the practice might have proved a &s;hare &s;ome way: it might have engaged my
<PB N="21" REF="034371_0021_0FFC2D7BC1312D00">
attention too much, or tended to make me popular, which I have ever guarded again&s;t, perhaps too much &s;o in &s;ome points; but I was early afraid of my mind and &s;ervices being tarni&s;hed with vanity. And here I may add, that from the time I came from &s;chool, I read but little, &s;ave religious books; and after I appeared in the mini&s;try, until late in life, read|ing even them was much taken from me, except the &s;criptures: all which I believe was in divine wi&s;dom, that I might not mini&s;ter from what I had gathered from religious writings; but might receive the arguments I was enabled to advance on behalf of the truth, by the imme|diate revelation of the Holy Spirit. And I can with truth &s;ay, that the Lord has been to me, mouth and wi&s;dom, tongue and utterance, to my own humbling admiration. May all the prai&s;e be given to him now and for ever!</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING now entered the li&s;t of publick combatants in the Lamb's army, I pret|ty &s;oon became concerned to travel for the pro|motion of truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s; and for more than twenty years, had but little inter|mi&s;&s;ion from go&s;pel labours.</P>
<P>In the Fifth month, 1749 (old &s;tile) I left home, in order to vi&s;it &s;ome part of Wales; in which journey my dear friend Lucy Brad|ley was made willing to accompany me (al|though, as &s;he &s;aid, &s;he knew not that her call to &s;ervice was much farther than to a&s;&s;i&s;t me); with whom I travelled in &s;weet unity, &s;he be|ing a true &s;ympathizing friend, and deep tra|vailler in &s;pirit, as well as rightly qualified pub|lickly to mini&s;ter. We vi&s;ited the meetings of Friends in Radnor&s;hire, Monmouth&s;hire, Gla|morgan&s;hire, Pembroke&s;hire, and part of North Wales; and in about &s;even weeks I returned home in peace and thankfulne&s;s, to my dear mother and relations; who had been made willing to give me up for truth's &s;ake, and gladly received me back. In this journey the principal &s;hare of the publick &s;ervice fell to my lot; wherein the Lord was evidently with me, &s;trengthening for the work of the day to the honour of his own name; and the te&s;timony of truth was &s;ometimes exalted, in its own au|thority, over the libertine and hypocritical pro|fe&s;&s;ors
<PB N="24" REF="034371_0024_0FFC2D749E83BCB0">
of it. The youth, and tender hone&s;t-minded, were vi&s;ited and refre&s;hed in divine love; liberty and &s;trength were afforded to de|clare it to tho&s;e not of our &s;ociety; and I had ground to hope that our labour was not entire|ly in vain: &s;ome per&s;ons being powerfully af|fected, who, I hope, long retained a &s;en&s;e of that vi&s;itation; particularly William Phillips from Cornwall, who was then upon a vi&s;it to his relations at Swan&s;ea.</P>
<P>In le&s;s than a week after my return from this journey, I went to the circular yearly meeting for the &s;even we&s;tern countries, which was held this year at Coventry, and was very large, and, in the main, &s;atisfactory. It was attended by many valuable experienced mini|&s;ters, who were careful of laying hands &s;ud|denly upon me; although I had good rea&s;on to believe that the mo&s;t weighty of them loved me; but were fearful of hurting me by di&s;cover|ing too much of their approbation or affection; which &s;ome minds, in the infancy of religious experience, have not been able to bear. Af|ter my return from this meeting, I was &s;trip|ped of that &s;trength wherewith the Almighty had been plea&s;ed to clothe me; which, with &s;ome other di&s;couragement I met with, &s;unk me very low, in&s;omuch that I was ready to doubt of all I had known, and call in que&s;tion my commi&s;&s;ion to mini&s;ter: and my &s;oul was attacked by the adver&s;ary in &s;ome of his mo&s;t &s;ubtil appearances, and baptized into a cloud of darkne&s;s. This di&s;pen&s;ation I afterwards
<PB N="25" REF="034371_0025_0FFC2D7234CD9FB8">
&s;aw to be &s;erviceable; the more &s;o, as before my return from my Wel&s;h journey, I had a pro&s;pect of another into the we&s;t of England; for therein I forgot all my former &s;ervices, was emptied of all &s;elf-&s;ufficiency, and became weak and depending as when I fir&s;t engaged in the weighty &s;ervice of the mini&s;try: and it lives in my experi|ence, that thus the Lord will deal with his &s;er|vants, for their pre&s;ervation, that they may dwell in a continual &s;en&s;e, that the excellency is of Him; from whom proceeds wi&s;dom, power, light, utterance, peace, and every good gift.</P>
<P>My concern for the we&s;t continuing and in|crea&s;ing, I imparted it to my relations, who being willing to give me up (though &s;orry to part with me), I &s;ought for a companion, but could hear of none &s;uitable. This added to my exerci&s;e; for it &s;eemed very dangerous for &s;uch a child as I, to travel alone; but after waiting as long as I dur&s;t, I laid my concern before Friends of our Monthly meeting, and reque&s;t|ed their certificate,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Should any one not acquainted with Friends di&s;ci|pline read the&s;e Memoirs, it is not improper to ob&s;erve, that, when a mini&s;ter, approved among&s;t them, believes it his or her duty to vi&s;it a di&s;tant part of the nation, &amp;c. a certificate is given of the unity of Friends of the monthly meeting whereof &s;uch mini&s;ter is a member, that Friends where they travel may be a&s;&s;ured that they do not move in &s;o weighty a &s;ervice without the concurrence of their Friends at home: al&s;o that the laying on of hands mentioned in the preceding page, is only to be under&s;tood as a figurative expre&s;&s;ion.</NOTE> but told them that I knew of no companion; and if they had not been
<PB N="26" REF="034371_0026_0FFC2D6F13E903F0">
free to let me go alone, I believe I &s;hould have been ea&s;y to have waited longer; but they gave me a certificate; and in the Eleventh month, 1749, I left home in great humility and fear, being accompanied by my dear bro|ther James Payton, who went with me to &s;e|veral meetings in our own county, and left me not without &s;ome doubt on account of the na|tural weakne&s;s of my con&s;titution, which he feared might &s;uffer in this winter's journey. I proceeded to Bri&s;tol, and from thence, through part of the counties of Wilts, Somer|&s;et, Dor&s;et, and Devon, to Penzance in Corn|wall, and returned back to that city in the &s;pring.</P>
<P>And although I went from home alone, I was not much without a &s;uitable companion, the Almighty putting it into the heart of one or other of his &s;ervants to accompany me. Mary Fry, of Sutton in Wilt&s;hire, went with me through Dor&s;et&s;hire; and Mary Pole, of Mil|verton in Somer&s;et&s;hire, through Devon&s;hire and Cornwall; who were both very tender of me, and &s;erviceable to me. The latter was not in the mini&s;try, but a &s;olid &s;ympathizing friend, and true labourer in &s;pirit in meetings.</P>
<P>I vi&s;ited the meetings of Friends pretty ge|nerally in Dor&s;et&s;hire, Devon&s;hire, and Corn|wall; &s;ome of which were attended by many people of other &s;ocieties; before whom the Lord gave me boldne&s;s to te&s;tify of his truth with good authority, and to lay open the fal&s;e and dangerous opinions of &s;ome profe&s;&s;ed
<PB N="27" REF="034371_0027_0FFC2D6D54BFD808">
Chri&s;tians, particularly that of uncondition|al election and reprobation; which dark prin|ciple was then likely to gain ground in the&s;e parts. I was concerned to appoint meetings at &s;everal places, where Friends had no meet|ing-hou&s;es; all which I hope had their &s;ervice. At Truro in Cornwall, I had a &s;atisfactory meeting, although the people at that town had heretofore manife&s;ted their di&s;like to Friends labouring among them; but they be|haved pretty peaceably now, and I had cau&s;e to believe my &s;ervice in this meeting tended to open the way for the circular yearly meeting to be held here; which it was in the year 1752, much to the &s;atisfaction of Friends. At Bath, in my return, I was concerned to appoint a meeting for the &s;trangers in town (it being the &s;ea&s;on for drinking the waters); to which &s;ome of them came, and it was a memorable opportunity, the power of truth being exalted to the reducing of their light and airy &s;pirits, to &s;ome degree of &s;olidity; for which my &s;oul bowed in thankfulne&s;s to Him who calls to and qualifies for his &s;ervice. In this meeting a man &s;at oppo&s;ite to me, who wrote by intervals while I was &s;peaking, and I apprehended was taking down what I &s;aid; but my &s;pirit was borne above looking at that, being bound to the te&s;timony of truth.</P>
<P>After &s;taying about a week at Bri&s;tol, I went for the Wel&s;h yearly meeting, which was held this year at Brecknock, being accom|panied by John Curtis, a valuable mini&s;ter of
<PB N="28" REF="034371_0028_0FFC2D6BC686E9E8">
Bri&s;tol, and divers other Friends. In our way we appointed meetings at Caerleon, Pontypool, and Abergavenny; at the fir&s;t of which places, I could not find that there had ever been a meeting before; but the people behaved well, and I hope it ended to the &s;atisfaction of the fen&s;ible friends pre&s;ent. It was held upon a Fir&s;t-day in the afternoon; and while we were in it, a number of people were going about the &s;treet with a fiddle; it being the cu&s;tom in &s;ome places in Wales, after what they call divine &s;er|vice, to entertain them&s;elves with mu&s;ick, or other diver&s;ions. What an incon&s;i&s;tency!</P>
<P>That at Abergavenny was large, and I hope of &s;ervice, in opening the way of the te&s;timony among&s;t the people. Here a Pre&s;byterian preacher made &s;ome di&s;turbance in the clo&s;e of it. I thought his aim was to cloud the doctrine which had been preached, and &s;o prevent the people from being &s;haken thereby from their old &s;entiments; but he was blamed by them, and I hope mi&s;&s;ed his end. I had not much publick &s;ervice at Brecknock, yet was glad I was there, for indeed it was a humbling time to me. For although, in porportion to my gift and experience, the Almighty had eminently favoured me in this journey; yet, on beholding the &s;ervice and conduct of &s;ome other of his mini&s;ters, and comparing mine with them, I was led to look upon my&s;elf but as a mean in|&s;trument, and greatly to e&s;teem the&s;e my el|ders in the truth. O! how &s;ecretly does the Lord work, to the purifying of the hearts of &s;uch of
<PB N="29" REF="034371_0029_0FFC2D6763578BE0">
his &s;ervants who de&s;ire to be dive&s;ted of eve|ry high thought, and humbly to ca&s;t down their crowns at his feet: which was the ardent prayer of my &s;oul, from the &s;en&s;e of the mi&s;er|able lo&s;s &s;ome had &s;u&s;tained, in being puffed up with &s;elf-conceit and the e&s;teem of the peo|ple; which I have &s;een to be a very fallacious line to mea&s;ure one's &s;elf by: for &s;ometimes that which is highly applauded by them, is re|proved by that Spirit which &s;earcheth all things.</P>
<P>From Brecknock I returned to Bri&s;tol yearly-meeting, from whence I thought of returning home; but, to my great di&s;appointment, a concern re&s;ted upon me to proceed to the year|ly meeting at London, in company with Rach|el Wil&s;on, who came with me from Brecknock, and was without any companion in the mini&s;try. This brought a great exerci&s;e upon my mind, under the con&s;ideration of the concern it would bring upon my relations; who I knew were de&s;irous that I might &s;teadily move in the coun&s;el of God; and perhaps might fear my running too fa&s;t, which I al&s;o dreaded; but finding I could not otherwi&s;e be ea&s;y, I advi&s;ed with &s;ome friends, and particularly with my ancient and honourable friend, Ben|jamin Kidd, who encouraged me therein.</P>
<P>The Bri&s;tol yearly meeting ended &s;atisfactori|ly, many valuable mini&s;ters attended it, and the te&s;timony of Truth was mea&s;urably exalt|ed. It had plea&s;ed the Lord in the &s;everal times I had been in this city, to favour me with
<PB N="30" REF="034371_0030_0FFC2D65D5E79AE0">
con&s;iderable liberty in the exerci&s;e of my gift, whereby a door was opened to me in the minds of Friends there; which favour I hope I receiv|ed with due thankfulne&s;s.</P>
<P>Being clear of Bri&s;tol, I proceeded to London attending &s;everal meetings in the way appointed by Rachel Wil&s;on; at one of which we met with our valuable friend, Daniel Stanton from America, with whom we went in company to London; where we were affectionately received by many Friends, and I had good ground to believe my coming to that city, was in the will and wi&s;dom of the Al|mighty, though greatly in a cro&s;s to my own.</P>
<P>After the yearly meeting, I returned direct|ly home, through mercy in peace, and was there gladly received by my dear mother, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Upon a review of this journey, I found a|bundant cau&s;e to adore the wi&s;dom, love, and care, of the heavenly Shepherd; which was eminently manife&s;ted in his conducting, dealing with, and pre&s;erving, me, a poor weak inex|perienced child. The many dangers I had e&s;caped, the many deep exerci&s;es I had been &s;upported under, with the multitude of favours conferred on &s;o unworthy an object, &s;truck me with admiration, and rai&s;ed this acknow|ledgement, that He
<Q>had not dealt with me according to my de&s;ert, but according to the multitude of his mercies.</Q></P>
<P>My return from this journey was in the Fourth month (old &s;tile), 17<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">0. I &s;taid about home until the fall of the year, when I found
<PB N="31" REF="034371_0031_0FFC2D63853CBE78">
mind drawn to Bath, principally on the account of &s;uch as re&s;orted thither to drink the waters; to which city I went, and &s;pent a few weeks therein, and at Bri&s;tol, &amp;c. I hope profitably. I pa&s;&s;ed the winter of this year chiefly at and about home, and among&s;t my relations.</P>
<P>In the &s;pring of the year 1751, I attended the yearly meeting for Wales, held at Newport in Shrop&s;hire, which was large and divinely favour|ed. My dear friend Samuel Fothergill attended it, to whom I imparted a concern, which I had for &s;ome time been under, of vi&s;iting Ireland; in which he encouraged me, and advi&s;ed that I would endeavour to get to Dublin half-year's meeting; and I had afterwards cau&s;e to believe his advice was right; for, although I did not arrive timely to attend it, yet, had I not come in time to have con&s;ulted Mary Pei&s;ley before &s;he left the city, I might not have been favour|ed with her company. Accordingly I very &s;oon &s;et forward, my brother accompanying me to Liverpool, and &s;eeing me on board a ve&s;&s;el bound for Dublin, in which he left me to the protection of Providence. We &s;ailed down the harbour, but the wind proving contrary, lay that night at anchor, and the next day returned to Liverpool; where I was content to wait, un|til He who &s;ent me forth was plea&s;ed to afford the means of my relea&s;e from my native land; which was in a few days, when I was favoured with a good pa&s;&s;age, for which my &s;pirit was thankful. I took up my lodgings in Dublin at John Barclay's, by whom, though per&s;onally unknown, I was kindly received.</P>

I told her that, as I was without a companion, I &s;hould be glad if &s;he could find freedom to go with me a part of the journey; to which &s;he &s;aid little then, but before &s;he left the city, &s;he informed me that &s;he had for &s;ome time felt drawings to vi&s;it the we&s;tern and northern provinces, and was free to join me in the&s;e parts; with which I thankfully concurred. It is worthy remarking, that the evening before I landed, &s;he being un|der the influence of heavenly goodne&s;s, and in that &s;tate re&s;igned to go this journey, it ap|peared to her that a companion would be &s;ent her from England. Thus does the Lord mer|cifully provide all things nece&s;&s;ary for &s;uch as tru&s;t in him, and are willing to follow whither|&s;oever he leads them.</P>
<P>Mary Pei&s;ley returned home from Dublin, in order to prepare for the journey. I &s;taid a few days, and then left it with an intention to vi&s;it two meetings in the county of Wicklow, and return back to the city. Several Friends ac|companied me in a coach, which I mention as being &s;ingularly providential, for the day we left town I was taken ill; but as a meeting was appointed at Wicklow, we went forward, and reached the place that night. Next day I was much wor&s;e, yet attended the meeting and had &s;ome little &s;ervice therein, though under a heavy load of &s;ickne&s;s; which continuing, I re|turned the next day to Dublin (which I could not have done on hor&s;eback), where I was
<PB N="33" REF="034371_0033_0FFC2D5DC72BB180">
laid up for about two weeks; in all which time my mind was remarkably re&s;igned to this di&s;pen&s;ation of Providence; feeling &s;weet peace in giving up to come the journey, even if it were the Lord's will I &s;hould lay down my natural life in that city; having a comfortable hope that it would have been in peace; but as he &s;aw meet, in wi&s;dom and mercy, to rai&s;e me from this &s;tate of weakne&s;s, my earne&s;t de&s;ire was, that my longer continuance in mutability might be to the honour of his ever worthy name.</P>
<P>In the time of my indi&s;po&s;ition, I lodged at Robert Clibborn's, who&s;e wife was exceeding|ly tender of me. John Barclay and two more in his family were ill, which rendered it im|proper for me to return to his hou&s;e. I &s;taid &s;ome little time in Dublin to recover my &s;trength, and my friend John Barclay's indi&s;|po&s;ition proving mortal, I attended the meet|ing held on account of his funeral; which was very large, and attended with a good degree of &s;olemnity. After this, I left the city ac|companied by a &s;olid young woman, named Elizabeth Cariton, not in the mini&s;try, who was with me about three weeks; in which time I pa&s;&s;ed through the meetings of Friends in the counties of Carlow and Wexford, to Waterford; where I was met by my dear friend Mary Pei&s;ley, who was my companion through mo&s;t of the remainder of this jour|ney: and I had cau&s;e thankfully to acknow|ledge the mercy of Providence in affording me one &s;o &s;teady and experienced, from who&s;e
<PB N="34" REF="034371_0034_0FFC2D5C36A22138">
conduct I might gather in&s;truction. We tra|velled together in great unity and affection, which rendered the trials we met with in the journey the more ea&s;y. The&s;e were con&s;ider|able, re&s;ulting in part from the nature of our &s;ervices; which were mo&s;tly pointed to the &s;tates of per&s;ons or meetings, and expo&s;ed us to cen&s;ure from &s;pirits un&s;ubjected to the pow|er of truth; but our good Ma&s;ter &s;upported us through all, and nearly united our &s;pirits to the living con&s;cientious profe&s;&s;ors of it, in that nation. It was &s;ometimes my lot in this jour|ney to appoint meetings in places where there were none of our Society, in which I had the unity of my companion and friend; and they mo&s;tly ended to &s;atisfaction, the Almighty pro|portioning wi&s;dom and &s;trength to the occa&s;i|ons. The 27th of the Seventh month I re|turned to Dublin, in hope that I might in a few days take my pa&s;&s;age for my native land; but two women friends from England, who had been vi&s;iting Ireland, being expected in town &s;oon, and to return home, I was free to wait a little for their company; but therein was di&s;appointed, for one of the friends got a fall from her hor&s;e in Dublin &s;treet, by which &s;he was di&s;abled from pur&s;uing her intention of going home. So I put to &s;ea, but the wind proving contrary, we were forced back, after having been beating again&s;t it almo&s;t four days. This &s;unk my &s;pirits con&s;iderably, but on my return &s;ervice opened for me, and the wind being &s;till contrary, I took a little turn in the

<P>After my return my &s;pirit re&s;ted &s;ome time in a quiet &s;ettlement, and great enjoyment in the truth; which was an abundant compen&s;a|tion for all my labour and &s;ufferings attending the journey. Before I left Ireland, I found my mind drawn to vi&s;it the quarterly meeting of mini&s;ters and elders in the province of Ul|&s;ter by an Epi&s;tle; and &s;oon after my return home, I was al&s;o concerned to write a few
<PB N="36" REF="034371_0036_0FFC2D5748E9D088">
lines to a people at Cardiff in Wales, who had in part relinqui&s;hed their former profe&s;&s;ions of religion, and &s;at together in &s;ilence, but were in an un&s;ettled &s;tate.</P>
<P>This winter I found my mind drawn in the love of truth to vi&s;it the meetings of Friends in London, and experienced true peace in the di&s;charge of that duty. My &s;ervice was ac|ceptable to Friends, and I returned home in thankfulne&s;s of heart to the Lord, unto whom is due the prai&s;e of all his works. I lodged with my former &s;choolmi&s;tre&s;s, Rachel Traf|ford, who now rejoiced in receiving me as a mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Thus far have I wrote as things have been revived in my remembrance, having made lit|tle or no minutes, whil&s;t on my journies, of my labours and exerci&s;es; but in my next journey which was into Scotland, my mind &s;eemed directed to make &s;ome remarks as I went along; which, as they are expre&s;&s;ive of the nature of my &s;ervice, and the manner wherein divine Wi&s;dom led me in the various changes of &s;ea&s;ons, I in&s;ert almo&s;t entire.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. Some Minutes of my Journey into Scotland, in Company with Mary Abbot, of Northamp|ton&s;hire.</HEAD>
<P>ON the 3d of the Fourth month, 1752 (new &s;tile), we went to Coalbrook Dale, and had a meeting there the &s;ame evening, in which we had good &s;atisfaction: the te&s;timony of truth flowed to the youth, &s;ome of whom were carried away with the vanities of this world, and the tender &s;eed of life in them was oppre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The 4th, we went to Shrew&s;bury, and that evening, accompanied by &s;ome friends of the town, vi&s;ited two friends who were impri&s;oned for tithes: in which vi&s;it we were favoured with the flowings of the refre&s;hing &s;treams of divine love, wherein the &s;pirits of &s;ome of us were united and comforted.</P>
<P>The 5th, being the Fir&s;t of the week, we at|tended two meetings in that town. In the morn|ing, the te&s;timony of truth was in a good degree &s;et over the minds of the people of other &s;ocie|ties, as well as of our own; although there is in this place a dark &s;pirit; but the Lord was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to bear our &s;pirits above it.</P>
<P>In the afternoon, a pretty many people of other &s;ocieties came in; but it con&s;i&s;ted with in|finite wi&s;dom to di&s;appoint their expectations;
<PB N="38" REF="034371_0038_0FFC2D519FF83828">
and as I abode in &s;ilence, I had peace. I thought the cau&s;e of this trial might be an example to one of that place, who was forward to mini|&s;ter, but without divine authority.</P>
<P>In the evening, we again vi&s;ited the pri&s;on|ers; and the 6th, went towards Warrington, where we came the 7th, and &s;o proceeded the 8th and 9th to the quarterly meeting at Lan|ca&s;ter; wherein I thought the expectation of the people was con&s;iderable towards me, who was a &s;tranger in the country; under which I &s;uffered, but patiently bore my te&s;timony in &s;ilence; being deeply affected with a &s;en&s;e of the prevalency of that &s;pirit which would ex|alt the creature. I was refre&s;hed under the mini&s;try of that deep and experienced &s;ervant of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, John Churchman of America, whom, with his companion John Pemberton, we met at this place.</P>
<P>The 11th, we went to Kendal, where the quar|terly meeting for We&s;tmoreland was held; wherein John Churchman had good &s;ervice, but I was &s;till pretty much &s;ilent; in which di&s;pen&s;ation I felt the refining power of the Almighty near, and was &s;en&s;ible of its &s;ervice, in emptying my &s;oul of old things, and preparing it for the fre&s;h reception of the openings of truth.</P>
<P>The 13th, in company with John Church|man, and many other friends, we &s;et forward for the yearly meeting for the four northern counties, which was held this year at Carli&s;le. In our way thither my&s;elf and companion &s;taid a meeting at Penrith, which was previou&s;ly ap|pointed
<PB N="39" REF="034371_0039_0FFC2D5010EB7F48">
by Kendal Friends, and was attended by many people of other &s;ocieties; and I be|lieve would have been of good &s;ervice, had it not been for &s;ome, with whom di&s;cerning Friends had not unity, intruding into the &s;er|vice of the mini&s;try.</P>
<P>At Carli&s;le, my &s;pirit was &s;et at liberty, and I laboured weightily, and was much favoured in the enlargement of truth. There &s;eemed a great &s;truggle between the two powers of light and darkne&s;s, and what greatly added to the exerci&s;e of &s;en&s;ible Friends was, that the pow|er of darkne&s;s di&s;covered it&s;elf in the appear|ance of mini&s;try, through &s;ome deluded &s;pi|rits; but, through divine favour, truth had the e&s;cendency.</P>
<P>We &s;taid at Carli&s;le over the next Fir&s;t-day, in which time we vi&s;ited &s;everal families of Friends to &s;atisfaction: the meetings on the Fir&s;t-day were attended by many of the town's people, and we were favoured with an evi|dence of being in our proper place and &s;er|vice, which was renewed cau&s;e of thankfulne&s;s.</P>
<P>From the 20th to the 23d, we vi&s;ited &s;eve|ral meetings in Cumberland, wherein the ex|pectation of the people was great; but my &s;atisfaction and rejoicing &s;tood in abiding with the &s;eed of God, which being oppre&s;&s;ed in the &s;ouls of &s;ome profe&s;&s;ors of truth, the te&s;timony of it did not ri&s;e in &s;uch authority, as at &s;ome other times.</P>
<P>The 24th, we went a long day's journey to Kel&s;o in Scotland, at which place my &s;pi|rit
<PB N="40" REF="034371_0040_0FFC2D4DCA2E6A30">
was &s;orely di&s;tre&s;&s;ed on account of truth's being almo&s;t for&s;aken by its profe&s;&s;ors, who were but few in that town. We got &s;ome comfort in vi&s;iting a &s;ick friend, who&s;e &s;on and hu&s;band we thought in a hopeful way.</P>
<P>The 27th, we went to Orm&s;ton, and in the way thither, my mind was drawn to the ea&s;t|ward; but when we came to our quarters, I could &s;ee but little likelihood of getting any a&s;&s;i&s;tance in vi&s;iting the people that way.</P>
<P>The 28th, we had a meeting at Orm&s;ton, which was exceedingly crowded, but &s;atisfac|tory. Being &s;till thoughtful about the peo|ple to the ea&s;tward, John Chri&s;ty (at who&s;e hou&s;e we lodged) told me that if I would &s;tay till the 30th, he would accompany me to any one place I &s;hould choo&s;e; which I was free to do, and we went to North Ber|wick, where I knew not that any meeting of Friends had been held before. We had a dark &s;pirit in &s;ome to encounter, before we could get a place to meet in, but at la&s;t we got a large granary. My &s;pirit was inexpre&s;|&s;ibly loaded before meeting, but in patience bent towards the centre of its &s;trength, in which &s;tate I went to the meeting. There came ma|ny people, and I admired at the &s;olidity of their behaviour. The Lord was with us, and ex|alted the te&s;timony of his truth, and we left the town in great &s;atisfaction, and I hope true thankfulne&s;s.</P>
<P>We returned that night to Orm&s;ton, and the next day, the 1&s;t of the Fifth month, went
<PB N="41" REF="034371_0041_0FFC2D4AE06D5888">
to Edinburgh, where we lodged at William Miller's. We attended the meetings in that city on the next Fir&s;t-day. That in the morn|ing was pretty large, although there are very few who profe&s;s with us in that city, and al|though cloudy in the beginning, yet the Al|mighty was plea&s;ed to favour in the conclu&s;ion, in exalting the te&s;timony of his truth. In the afternoon the hou&s;e was exceedingly crowded, and the people very un&s;ettled; but after a long time of exerci&s;e, life ro&s;e mea&s;urably, wherein the &s;pring of go&s;pel mini&s;try was opened.</P>
<P>The 5th, we went to Linlithgow, where was no meeting of Friends. We got a &s;mall meet|ing in an inn with the town's people, which was low, though not quite dead; and return|ed at night to Edinburgh, having travelled about twenty-eight Scotch miles that day. In the morning before I &s;et out, I found my&s;elf very poorly, and in the journey I got wor&s;e, and the next day &s;till wor&s;e; yet I attended a meeting which was appointed for the profe&s;&s;ors of truth only, who&s;e &s;tates were mo&s;tly di&s;|tre&s;&s;ing, a libertine &s;pirit having carried away the youth, and an ea&s;y indifferent one prevail|ing among&s;t tho&s;e farther advanced in years; both which were &s;poken to.</P>
<P>My illne&s;s &s;till increa&s;ed, and, proving a fe|ver, reduced me to a &s;tate of great weakne&s;s, and I experienced much poverty of &s;pirit; but my frequent petition to the Almighty was for pa|tience, and he was plea&s;ed to favour me with quietne&s;s and re&s;ignation.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="034371_0042_0FFC2D49513B9B18">The 25th, we went from Edinburgh towards the north. I was &s;till very weak, but gradu|ally gathered &s;trength, and was encouraged to pre&s;s forward; which I did as far as there were any meetings of Friends, and returned to Eng|land by way of Perth and Gla&s;gow. The number of Friends in Scotland is &s;mall, and the life of truth low in &s;ome of them; but among the few, there are &s;ome who &s;tand as monuments of the divine power, in this bar|ren and almo&s;t de&s;olate land; wherein however there is an open door in many places, to preach the go&s;pel to tho&s;e not profe&s;&s;ing with us.</P>
<P>From Gla&s;gow we went to Carli&s;le without holding any meetings. The fir&s;t night we lodged at Stirling, where my &s;pirit was exer|ci&s;ed re&s;pecting the holding of a meeting; but having only one young man with us, not the mo&s;t &s;teady as a Friend, and it appearing to be a high profe&s;&s;ing place, I &s;uffered cowardice to prevail, which occa&s;ioned future di&s;tre&s;s: there was time enough for an evening meeting after we came to our inn; and I think the landlord would have granted us his large dining|room. In the morning we proceeded forward, a long day's journey, and dangerous roads; lodged at a very poor lonely Scotch inn upon a chaff bed; our bed-room a ground floor, and no fa&s;tening to the door; and there being men in the hou&s;e drinking, we were not quite ea&s;y with our &s;ituation, but through divine favour, we went to &s;leep, and were pre&s;erved from harm. We rode through much heavy
<PB N="43" REF="034371_0043_0FFC2D46CC68FC98">
rain from Gla&s;gow to this place, which had &s;welled the river Er&s;k &s;o much, that it was not thought &s;afe to attempt to pa&s;s it the night we came there; but next morning we cro&s;&s;ed it in two branches: it had a dreadful appearance, the water looked very muddy, the &s;tream wide, deep, and rapid; but we had careful guides, and through favour of Providence got &s;afe over the 17th of the Sixth month, and came to Carli&s;le the &s;ame day. And here I may note to the honour of Scotland, that in all the time I was in it, I do not recollect hearing an oath or a cur&s;e uttered, except the word <HI>faith</HI> might be accounted an oath, which was &s;poken by a &s;oldier. Alas, for England! the &s;treets of who&s;e towns echo with mo&s;t profane lan|guage, to the &s;hame and condemnation of its magi&s;trates, as well as its wicked inhabitants. At Carli&s;le I parted from my companion, who was concerned to vi&s;it &s;ome of the northern counties, and I, to attend the quarterly meet|ing at York; where I came the 22d, taking meetings in my way, at Penrith, Raby, and Haby. The la&s;t, being a monthly meeting, was pretty large, and I believe many &s;ouls were refre&s;hed therein: the te&s;timony of truth ro&s;e in con&s;iderable &s;trength and clearne&s;s; and the meeting concluded in a &s;en&s;e of hea|venly &s;weetne&s;s, which was again renewed in the women's meeting. My &s;pirit was humbly bowed in thankfulne&s;s, that my lot was ca&s;t there that day.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="034371_0044_0FFC2D44848D0DE8">At York I met with my dear friend Ann Fothergill from London, and many other friends whom I dearly loved, who were glad to &s;ee me returned to my native land, the more &s;o from a report having prevailed in England, that I was dead.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I think it worthy noting, that Samuel Fothergill, being at London yearly-meeting, when this report was current, on a friend's bringing him a &s;uppo&s;ed con|firmation of the truth of it, pau&s;ed awhile, and bid her tell the per&s;on who informed her, from him, She is not dead: which was &s;oon confirmed by an ac|count from Scotland.</NOTE> Here my mind was turned to con&s;ider the wonderful loving-kindne&s;s of Providence manife&s;ted in this jour|ney; and, con&s;idering my weak &s;tate of health through a great part of it, I thought it mira|culous that I &s;hould &s;o &s;oon accompli&s;h it; &s;uch a fatigue &s;eeming no way proportioned to my &s;trength. But with God all things are po&s;&s;ible; therefore have his &s;ervants cau&s;e to tru&s;t in his holy arm of power.</P>
<P>The quarterly meeting at York was merci|fully attended with the pre&s;ence of the Ma&s;ter of our &s;olemn a&s;&s;emblies; the te&s;timony of truth was exalted, and the &s;pirits of his peo|ple united in go&s;pel fellow&s;hip.</P>
<P>The 25th, I went to Malton, accompanied by my dear friend Sarah Taylor of Manche&s;ter. We had a meeting there that evening, and the 26th went to Scarborough, and that even|ing vi&s;ited a young man, who I thought was near his end; but we had little to &s;ay to him,
<PB N="45" REF="034371_0045_0FFA6C82CD6E04D0">
his condition being lamentably &s;tupid. I thought intemperance was the cau&s;e of his in|di&s;po&s;ition, and found afterwards I was not mi&s;taken.

<P><PB N="46" REF="034371_0046_0FFC2D4148B20360">The 27th, being Fir&s;t-day, we attended the meetings. In the morning, we were much fa|voured with the evidence of truth in our &s;er|vice: &s;everal were there not of our Society who behaved well, and I believe went away &s;atisfied. My concern was to &s;hew them the difference betwixt true and fal&s;e &s;aith, and the tendency of each; with &s;ome other truths, which immediately opened in my under&s;tand|ing. In the afternoon, the meeting was large, but the Lord &s;aw meet to di&s;appoint the ex|pectations of the people, and manife&s;t both to them and us, that without him we can do nothing in his &s;ervice; for neither of us had a word to &s;ay to them; but I was concerned in &s;upplication, and was abundantly rewarded, in &s;ubmitting quietly to this di&s;pen&s;ation of di|vine wi&s;dom. In the evening, we vi&s;ited two friends who could not attend meetings, by rea&s;on of age or indi&s;po&s;ition; and next morn|ing, another friend in a very low e&s;tate of mind, with whom we had a good opportunity, and left him better than we found him; and I afterwards heard that from that time, he was re&s;tored. That afternoon we de|parted in peace from Scarborough, and re|turned to Malton, &s;o to York, Leeds, Rawden, Bradford, and Halifax; in all which places I met with a &s;hare of exerci&s;es, and, I thought, was mo&s;tly very low in the mini&s;try; but had the con&s;olation to believe that what I &s;tammered out was &s;uited to the &s;tates of the people; which is a proof of true mini&s;try.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="034371_0047_0FFC2D3FB5C146B8">The 7th of the Seventh month, we came to Manche&s;ter, where I left Sarah Taylor; the 10th, I went to Warrington, and had a meeting there that evening, wherein I was &s;ilent as to te&s;timony.</P>
<P>The 11th, I went to Liverpool, in my way &s;topped to take &s;ome refre&s;hment at Pre&s;cot, and found my mind exerci&s;ed for the people of that town, wherein there was no meeting of Friends; but went on for Liverpool, and next day was at two meetings there, and vi&s;ited a friend in di&s;tre&s;s, in all which I had good &s;a|tisfaction. In the evening, finding a concern for Pre&s;cot &s;till to remain, I propo&s;ed to Friends, the having of a meeting there the next morn|ing, in my way to Warrington; which, though &s;ome difficulty was &s;tarted, was accompli&s;hed, and a ble&s;&s;ed opportunity it was; the Lord's power being largely revealed, and the people behaving &s;olidly, although I &s;uppo&s;e, a meet|ing of Friends had not been held in the town for very many years.</P>
<P>In the evening, I had a meeting in Warring|ton. The 14th, I went to Morley, my dear friend Samuel Fothergill, and &s;everal other friends accompanying me, and divers others meeting us from Manche&s;ter: and the Lord, in his wonderful mercy, was plea&s;ed to open the fre&s;h &s;pring of his love, and favour us with a &s;weet opportunity together therein: in a thankful &s;en&s;e whereof we parted from each other; and I came by way of Stafford and Ather&s;ton, home the 20th, where I was glad|ly
<PB N="48" REF="034371_0048_0FFC2D3D70D3E890">
received by my dear and worthy mother, &amp;c. After &s;ome little time of &s;ettlement, my mind was directed to take a view of my late journey, in the cour&s;e whereof I di&s;covered the wonderful loving-kindne&s;s of God largly manife&s;ted; but was for a time much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed on account of not having had a meeting at Stirling, as before hinted: under which di&s;|tre&s;s my &s;oul ardently de&s;ired that for the fu|ture I might be careful to di&s;charge my duty; for I found it a heavy burden not to be clear from the blood of the people.</P>
<P>In a few weeks after my return from this journey I went to our quarterly meeting at Ship&s;ton; which was eminently favoured with the pre&s;ence of the Mo&s;t High.</P>
<P>In the fall of the year I was obliged to ac|company my &s;i&s;ter to Bath, for the benefit of her health; in which city I was the mo&s;t affectingly dipped into a &s;tate of poverty, that ever I had known my&s;elf to be, which, being joined by great weakne&s;s of body, was hard to bear, yet I believe not without its peculiar &s;ervice.</P>
<P>I vi&s;ited Bri&s;tol meeting twice in this jour|ney, where I was made to ta&s;te of the pover|ty and weakne&s;s, which appears in many there, through unfaithfulne&s;s. It was indeed a time of mourning to the &s;ervants of the Lord, while tho&s;e who were the cau&s;e of it required of them a &s;ong; but they were con&s;trained for the mo&s;t part to bear their burdens in &s;olemn &s;ilence.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="034371_0049_0FFC2D3BE37B7F00">At Bath I &s;uffered much under a libertine &s;pirit, which was very apparent both among&s;t tho&s;e who profe&s;&s;ed truth, and others in that place. I had &s;everal te&s;timonies of clo&s;e re|proof to bear to friends, and &s;ome pretty open &s;ervice with &s;trangers in town, and upon the whole had cau&s;e of thankfulne&s;s admini&s;tered; the Lord rewarding my faithfulne&s;s and &s;uffer|ings with peace in the end; and I returned home in a much better &s;tate of health than I left it; the u&s;e of the waters having been of &s;er|vice to me, though of little to my &s;i&s;ter. But now another trial of faith came upon me, which was the near approach of a vi&s;it to Friends in America, which had appeared in pro&s;pect for about a year; with an apprehen&s;ion that I mu&s;t go with my dear friend Mary Pei&s;ley, who I believed was preparing for that &s;ervice: yet I never gave her any hint of accompanying her, being de&s;irous that if it mu&s;t be my lot, it might be evidently pointed by the finger of Providence.</P>
<P>On my return home I received a letter from her, wherein &s;he de&s;ired to be informed, whe|ther I knew of any woman friend going to America from England, and hinted her con|cern for that quarter of the world. This &s;tuck clo&s;e to my mind, yet I kept it to my&s;elf for &s;everal weeks, and then communicated it to my dear mother, who heard it with a becom|ing re&s;ignation, telling me it was not entirely unexpected to her.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="034371_0050_0FFC2D384030D7E8">And although it was exceeding hard, to the natural part in her, thus to part with me in her declining years; e&s;pecially as &s;he &s;o ten|derly loved me as a child, as well as in the truth; &s;he freely gave me up to the divine re|quiring, earne&s;tly de&s;iring that the Lord might be my director and pre&s;erver.</P>
<P>Upon this, I wrote to my dear friend Mary Pei&s;ley. Some extracts of my letter to her, with her an&s;wer, follow.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>It is not becau&s;e I forgot thy affectionate re|que&s;t of hearing from me &s;oon, that I have &s;o long po&s;tponed a reply to thy la&s;t accepta|ble favour; but when it came here I was from home (as I hope thou art already advi&s;ed by a few lines I wrote from Bath), and the &s;equel of this will di&s;cover my rea&s;on for not writing thee immediately on my return.</P>
<P>With plea&s;ure I ob&s;erved that thy health was better than heretofore, and hope the ble&s;&s;ing is &s;till continued, &s;o that by the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of heavenly goodne&s;s, thou ha&s;t been and &s;till maye&s;t be capable to perform the duty re|quired, with a degree of ea&s;e and cheerfulne&s;s, to which a good &s;hare of health greatly con|tributes; although it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed with humble gratitude, that the Lord is to his &s;ervants &s;trength in weakne&s;s, of body as well as mind.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="034371_0051_0FFC2D36A8D06128">What we have &s;een of the exaltation of his arm of power in this re&s;pect, may encourage us to per&s;everance, and a &s;teady dependency thereon; and &s;ilence the voice of nature, which &s;ometimes in&s;inuates that we are not able to perform what is required; for we have good cau&s;e to believe nothing is impo&s;&s;ible with Him who has called us; but, through his power communicated, we may perfectly perform his will. And &s;uppo&s;e our race to be attended with weakne&s;s, pain, anxious concern, travail of &s;oul, and inconveniency to the bo|dy; can it ever equal the incomparable &s;uffer|ings of the Captain of our &s;alvation? Oh! how does the con&s;ideration of the tribulating path he invariably trod, &s;tifle the pleadings for ea&s;e and plea&s;ure? For &s;hall we, who dare to a&s;pire to no higher title than &s;ervants, expect to be better accommodated than was our Lord? Shall we &s;upinely &s;ettle in the outward po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions afforded us, when he laboriou&s;ly trod the wine-pre&s;s alone, and that for our &s;akes? He was de&s;titute of a place of re&s;idence, and had not where to lay his head, though Lord of all; and although he could limit the power of Satan, yea, totally bind him, yet &s;uffered the contradiction of &s;inners again&s;t him&s;elf, as well as a &s;eries of deep temptations. Let us be united to the &s;ufferings infinite Wi&s;dom allots, remembering the ble&s;&s;ing dropt on &s;uch as endure afflictions.</P>

<P>I rejoice to find that unity, and &s;ympathy of &s;pirit, which &s;o remarkably attended us when pre&s;ent, &s;ub&s;i&s;ts now ab&s;ent; and thought my wi&s;h in my la&s;t was an&s;wered in the &s;en&s;e thou had&s;t of my &s;tate.

<P>I now come to an&s;wer thy la&s;t reque&s;t, which will &s;hew the cau&s;e of my &s;ilence, viz. Whether I know of any woman friend who was going from England to America.

<P>But my dear friend, I am almo&s;t at a lo&s;s to find terms to expre&s;s the laborious thought which has po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed my &s;oul; for it &s;eems to me, that Providence de&s;igns I &s;hould accom|pany thee; unto which, if way may be made for me, and an unque&s;tionable evidence given that it is right, I am at la&s;t re&s;igned; al|though it be but to be a &s;ervant of &s;ervants;

but he only knows who di&s;covers the inward &s;truggle betwixt fle&s;h and &s;pirit, with what reluctance I &s;hall, if it mu&s;t be &s;o, part from my dear relations, e&s;pecially my dear and honoured mother, unto whom I have com|municated the painful thought.

I have waited to have the thing a little &s;ettled on her mind, and &s;he ye&s;terday gave me leave to inform thee of it.</P>
<P>And now my dear friend, I intreat thee to weigh it well, and as di&s;intere&s;tedly as po&s;|&s;ible, and give me thy thoughts thereupon with all the freedom which our friend&s;hip, and the nature of the ca&s;e, requires, not concealing one doubt; for I am exceedingly afraid of being deceived, and would willing|ly be convinced, if this appearance is but for the proving of my &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.

<OPENER><SALUTE>My dearly beloved in the Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS goes with the &s;alutation of my be&s;t love, and may inform thee, that I received thy two very acceptable favours of the Tenth and Twelfth month. The la&s;t came fir&s;t to hand, for I did not get that from Bath till la&s;t week; yet was it very acceptable to me, and a &s;tronger confirmation of what thou mentions in the latter part of thy la&s;t being right, if my concern is &s;o. For the bapti&s;m thou there de|&s;cribes as into a cloud of darkne&s;s, bears a ju&s;t re&s;emblance to what my &s;pirit pa&s;&s;ed through, before I had a di&s;tinct di&s;cerning of the near approach of the journey which is now before me: and agrees with the experience of that great in&s;trument John Churchman, as he wrote to me before he had any knowledge of my concern, but what he received by &s;ympa|thy; which was &s;ome &s;trength to me, and what I greatly de&s;ired. Thy la&s;t came to hand about two weeks after its date, which I &s;hould have an&s;wered &s;ooner, but that I wait|ed for his an&s;wer, being willing to comply with thy reque&s;t <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That part of my letter to Mary Pei&s;ley I omit|ted to tran&s;cribe in the before-written ab&s;tract.</NOTE> in con&s;ulting him, which I had not done before: and notwith&s;tanding his writing as he did, his reply was,
<Q>That he
<PB N="55" REF="034371_0055_0FFC2D2D766C7EC0">
had thoughts of my being under &s;uch an exerci&s;e, and therefore my letter was not &s;urpri&s;ing to him; but that he had little to &s;ay to it, well knowing that it is &s;afe for us all to attend to that divine in&s;truction which can alone make truly knowing in our lea&s;t acceptable &s;ervices at home, as well as the mo&s;t weighty we may be called to abroad;</Q>
but what he did &s;ay was very edifying, and although the concurrence of &s;uch as him is what we mu&s;t naturally de&s;ire; yet to our own Ma&s;ter we mu&s;t &s;tand or fall.</P>
<P>I find it a great trial to my poor father to part with me, but the thoughts of thy going with me has made it much ea&s;ier to him; and for my part I may acknowledge it is a favour, neither looked for, nor expected; it being like forbid me to take any thought about a com|panion, as well indeed it might, when my kind, good Ma&s;ter was providing &s;o agreeably for me. To my kind and good Ma&s;ter I owe fir&s;t and chief my hearty thanks, for all the benefit received from &s;econdary cau&s;es.</P>
<P>But thou maye&s;t remember, my dear, though I wrote to thee to know if any friend from your nation was likely to go, it was not by way of querying for a companion; but it &s;prings on my heart to &s;ay, Thou art the woman, and I really believe the thing is of the Lord; and as we abide in his coun&s;el, I firmly hope that he will ble&s;s us together, and make his work to pro&s;per in our hands, if our eye be but &s;ingle to his glory, &s;eeking,
<PB N="56" REF="034371_0056_0FFC2D2B2B1ED180">
hoping, nor de&s;iring, any thing but the ad|vancement thereof: and I can a&s;&s;ure thee my dear friend, notwith&s;tanding the love I have for thee in the truth, and the affection which I bear to thy per&s;on, with the likene&s;s of &s;ouls I had di&s;covered; yet, did I feel any ob&s;truc|tion or doubt in my mind of the thing's being right, I dare not conceal it from thee, nor take one &s;tep knowingly, out of the light and coun&s;el of truth, in to important an affair; and it is ju&s;t with me to &s;ay,
<Q>Tempt not the Lord thy God,</Q>
in &s;eeking more &s;trong and convincing manife&s;tations than he may &s;ee meet to give thee: but be willing to go in faith, leaning on thy &s;taff; for I mu&s;t tell thee, I think I have brought &s;ufferings on my|&s;elf for &s;o doing; for, &s;ince the time that it was clearly manife&s;ted unto me as a duty, till within the&s;e few weeks, I have been peaceably re&s;igned; in which &s;tate was favoured with great tranquillity of &s;oul, which made me look on the difficulties and dangers of the journey, with &s;uch eyes, that I began to fear that I had a will to go, and &s;et my face again&s;t it, till I had a further manife&s;tation of its being right. And here nature began to plea&s;e it&s;elf with many plea&s;ing pro&s;pects in my &s;tay; and the enemy was at hand to &s;ugge&s;t that the former manife&s;tation was but to try my love and obe|dience; and here I lo&s;t faith, and without it could no more think of going than of removing mountains. Thus did the enemy work as in a my&s;tery, till my &s;pirit was brought into &s;uch

darkne&s;s and di&s;tre&s;s, as is better felt than ex|pre&s;&s;ed. I am now again, by the mercy of God, and by that faith which is his gift, fully re&s;igned without any further manife&s;tation; than in looking that way wherein I &s;ee a little light, peace and comfort to my poor &s;oul; and in turning any other, fear, pain, and darkne&s;s, meet me.</P>
<P>Thus, my friend, have I given thee a &s;hort but true account of the dealings of the Lord with my &s;oul; which has been the cau&s;e of my &s;ilence till this day, for the forepart of this letter was wrote more than three weeks ago, but could not find &s;trength to fini&s;h it till now; yet in all that trying &s;ea&s;on had no doubt of thy concern being right. Ah! what &s;tates and di&s;pen&s;ations mu&s;t we pa&s;s through, who are &s;itting to &s;peak of the Lord's wonders which are &s;een in the deeps!</P>
<P>If it be my lot to go, the way which now &s;eems pointed to me is, to &s;pend &s;ome time in Dublin; to go from thence with Friends to the yearly meeting at London; and, when clear of that city, to take &s;hipping from thence: this I hope will be acceptable to thee, but if thou ha&s;t any call to Ireland before thou goes, let not this prevent thee.</P>

<P>After the receipt of this letter I continued to make preparation for the journey, my way being open both in the minds of my relations and friends; though it was a trial to both to part with me.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Some Minutes of Travels, Labours, and Suffer|ings in America, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ON the 4th of the Sixth month, 1753, I took an affecting and affectionate fare|wel of my dear mother and relations, leaving her and them to the protection of Providence; and went, accompanied with my &s;i&s;ter Ann, to Worce&s;ter. I was at a monthly meeting there the next day, which was laborious and exerci&s;ing, &s;ome Friends being &s;unk into a &s;tate of indolence, and, though &s;ometimes fa|voured with a feeling &s;en&s;e of divine good, not quickened thereby to action in the affairs of the church: and &s;o the vi&s;itation of heaven is rendered fruitle&s;s, while the things of this world are pur&s;ued with indu&s;try and ardency. Again&s;t this &s;pirit, I, with &s;ome others, had to te&s;tify, in clo&s;e doctrine and advice; and, although the meeting was dull and painful in the beginning, it ended in a &s;weet living &s;tream of &s;upplication and prai&s;e: in which the living pre&s;ent, committed each other into the hands of the Almighty for pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="034371_0059_0FFC2D23512344A0">In the women's meeting, I endeavoured for a regulation, that our Chri&s;tian di&s;cipline might be revived, for which a concern had re&s;ted upon my mind for &s;ome years: and &s;ome wo|men Friends of this city being under a like exerci&s;e, it afforded a comfortable hope, that the Lord would qualify in&s;truments for this &s;ervice. In the evening, the vi&s;itation of in|finite goodne&s;s was renewed to us, and to a few friends who came to vi&s;it us at my dear friend A&s;hby's, in the &s;en&s;e of which we part|ed. The 6th we went to Eve&s;ham, where we were met by my brother James, and &s;everal friends from Ireland, who were going to the yearly meeting at London. We &s;taid over the monthly meeting there the next day, and &s;o proceeding on our journey (Ann A&s;hby go|ing forward with us), reached London the 9th; where I met with my dear friend and compani|on, Mary Pei&s;ley.</P>
<P>The yearly meeting was large, and attend|ed by many weighty Friends; who were di|vinely a&s;&s;i&s;ted to labour for the promotion of Truth, and the ordering of the affairs of the church.</P>
<P>My brother and &s;i&s;ter left me in London; and, my companion Mary Pei&s;ley having a con|cern to attend the meetings at Colche&s;ter, Woodbridge, and Norwich, I &s;pent a little time at Chelmsford, at the hou&s;e of John Grif|fith (the &s;tate of my health and &s;pirits being &s;uch as &s;eemed to call for re&s;t and quiet), and returned to London in about two weeks; but
<PB N="60" REF="034371_0060_0FFC2D21A6F01BF0">
being &s;till poorly in health, I went to the coun|try-hou&s;e of my worthy friend John Hayward, accompanied by Ann Fothergill; where I was indi&s;po&s;ed, and confined to my bed and the hou&s;e, for about a week. Recovering a little &s;trength, I returned to London; where the di&s;order returned, and continued for nine or ten days; and being &s;ucceeded by the jaun|dice, it brought me very low; but through the kindne&s;s of Providence, I was pre&s;erved patient and re&s;igned under this di&s;pen&s;ation. In this time my companion returned to London, but did not find her way open to leave Eng|land; &s;o that my trials were increa&s;ed with the pro&s;pect of being longer detained, and at a di&s;tance from my dear relations. But infinite Wi&s;dom knows be&s;t how to plan out the way for his people, the &s;ecret workings of who&s;e Providence I thought I clearly di&s;covered, in this &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of probations being permitted to attend me where they did. Had it been at home it would have been much more afflict|ing both to my relations and my&s;elf; as it would have rendered their parting with me in &s;uch a weak &s;tate of health the more painful, and my leaving home the more difficult: nay, I have que&s;tioned, if I had not left it as I did, whether, con&s;idering the di&s;couragement, I &s;hould have gone the journey. Nor was my indi&s;po&s;ition without a &s;ingular &s;ervice: for my health had langui&s;hed under the oppre&s;&s;ion of the remains of the fever which I had at Edin|burgh; which by this di&s;order were, in a good
<PB N="61" REF="034371_0061_0FFC2D201D41DA58">
mea&s;ure, carried off, and my body the better prepared to &s;u&s;tain the fatigues and trials of the en&s;uing journey, ari&s;ing from the difference of climate, &amp;c. So that in this painful allotment, I had renewed cau&s;e to ble&s;s and prai&s;e the name of my God, and to acknowledge, that whatever he does is be&s;t.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t as &s;oon as I recovered &s;trength to get abroad, the cloud di&s;per&s;ed; and we found our &s;pirits at liberty to take our pa&s;&s;age on board the Alexander, Captain Curling, bound from London to Charle&s;ton, in South Caro|lina; which &s;ailed in about a week after we a|greed to go in her. The la&s;t Fir&s;t-day we were in London, we were favoured to take a comfortable farewel of many of our friends, in the feeling &s;en&s;e of divine goodne&s;s; where|in al&s;o, we were enabled to re&s;ign and commit each other into the hands of the Almighty for pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>We left London the 21&s;t of the Eighth month, 1753; and, as our ve&s;&s;el was to &s;top at Port&s;mouth to take in &s;ome of her pa&s;&s;en|gers, our friends thought it be&s;t for us to go thither by land: which we did, and &s;everal of them freely accompanied us.</P>
<P>We came to Port&s;mouth the 24th, and went on board our ve&s;&s;el the 25th, where we took leave of our friends with affection.</P>
<P>Being &s;ettled in our ve&s;&s;el, a &s;weet compo|&s;ure came over my &s;pirit; which &s;trengthened my faith that I was moving by divine direction.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="034371_0062_0FFC2D1BF90EF2E8">The next day the wind turned again&s;t us, and we came to an anchor in Yarmouth Road, I&s;le of Wight. Being Fir&s;t-day, we were a little thoughtful about having a meeting with the pa&s;&s;engers; but one of our company be|ing a clergyman, and the &s;hip's crew bu&s;y in &s;ettling the ve&s;&s;el, we concluded it would not be very ea&s;ily obtained, and were content in &s;itting together in our own apartment; dur|ing which time the par&s;on got &s;ome of our people together in the great cabin, and read prayers to them.</P>
<P>I had purpo&s;ely left our room door open, in order that, if any duty pre&s;ented, I might have an opportunity of performing it; and af|ter they had done, I found a concern to call upon the Lord in humble &s;upplication, to which I gave up; but a part of the company went on deck, being I &s;uppo&s;ed exampled by their teacher; however I was favoured with a pretty &s;atisfactory opportunity, and the &s;trengthening evidence of peace in the conclu|&s;ion.</P>
<P>The 27th, we &s;et &s;ail, and pa&s;&s;ed the Need|les the 28th. The 29th, the wind came again&s;t us, and blowing hard we anchored in the even|ing in Portland Bay, where we lay till the 3d of the ninth month; when we &s;et &s;ail, and got clear of the land the 5th; from which time we were mo&s;tly favoured with gentle favourable winds, till we came near the coa&s;t of South Carolina.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="034371_0063_0FFC2D1A647488E8">The 18th of the Tenth month, we got in|to &s;oundings; but the wind blowing very hard, and the &s;ea running high, our captain dur&s;t not attempt to go over Charle&s;ton bar, &s;o &s;tood off, in hopes the wind might fall; but in&s;tead of that it turned again&s;t us, and continued to blow very hard till the 22d: all which time we lay with our helm la&s;hed, driving with the wind. The 22d, the &s;ea and wind fell very much, the weather (which in this time had been very foul) cleared up, and the wind became favourable, and we got within &s;ight of land; but it being to the &s;outh|ward of our de&s;igned port, the captain tacked about to the northward, hoping thereby to gain &s;o much in the night as to be able to run in with the tide in the morning; but we were again beat back to &s;ea by a contrary &s;tormy wind.</P>
<P>Thus were we to&s;&s;ed to and fro, almo&s;t within &s;ight of our harbour; but through prevailing grace our minds were wonderfully pre&s;erved above either fear or complaint, en|joying a clam within, in the mid&s;t of a &s;torm without; being happily re&s;igned to &s;uffer in this way, if it were the Lord's will &s;o to ap|point: which ble&s;&s;ed di&s;po&s;ition, attended us through the voyage, helped to alleviate our bodily hard&s;hips, which would otherwi&s;e have appeared con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>We were &s;ea-&s;ick, though not &s;o extremely as we expected; and we &s;uffered much from the exce&s;&s;ive heat of the weather, &s;teering
<PB N="64" REF="034371_0064_0FFC2D181F3A2018">
within one degree, as far &s;outh as the tropic of Cancer; in which latitude I believe we con|tinued near three weeks, being becalmed; and, neither I nor my companion being very &s;trong, nature had a con&s;iderable &s;truggle, to &s;urmount the expen&s;e of &s;pirits &s;he &s;u&s;tain|ed.</P>
<P>But we had cau&s;e to be thankful that we e&s;|caped a violent fever, which frequently &s;eizes tho&s;e who pa&s;s through this climate, and have been u&s;ed to one much colder.</P>
<P>During the &s;torm, the &s;eams of our ve&s;&s;el, being opened on the &s;ide where we lay, let in the wet, and our apartment was in a manner flooded. My bed was &s;o wet that I could not lie therein, &s;o I threw my&s;elf down for &s;everal nights upon &s;ome blankets in a birth in the great cabin, and &s;lept better than I could have expected; but the &s;pray of the &s;ea drove &s;o upon it, even there, that my linen was &s;o damp, that I e&s;teemed it a &s;ingular mercy I was not exceeding ill.</P>
<P>Indeed we were both of us brought very low, but recruited again as the weather clear|ed up; which it did the 24th, and we &s;et &s;ail in the evening, and the 25th got our pilot on board, who intended that night to run as near the bar as prudent, and wait for another tide to carry us into port. But here we apprehend|ed our&s;elves to be in imminent danger; for, the man who &s;ounded mi&s;taking the length of the line which he let go, the ve&s;&s;el ran too far before they dropped anchor; &s;o that we lay
<PB N="65" REF="034371_0065_0FFC2D14D0D93F68">
all night in very &s;hallow water, &s;o near, if not upon the breakers, that had the wind &s;prung up fre&s;h, it &s;eemed que&s;tionable our having room to turn the ve&s;&s;el from them, when the anchors were weighed: but the Lord pre&s;erv|ed us, and we landed at Charle&s;ton the 26th in the morning, under a grateful &s;en&s;e of his merciful Providence having attended us through the voyage. We were upwards of nine weeks on &s;hip-board.</P>
<P>We had &s;everal meetings while on &s;hip|board with the &s;ailors and pa&s;&s;engers, who were of different countries. There was a South Carolina woman and her negro maid, a man and his wife, the one a German and the other a Swi&s;s; a Scotch &s;choolma&s;ter, our cap|tain and his brother of French extraction, if not born in France.</P>
<P>Our fir&s;t meeting was with the &s;ailors and &s;teerage pa&s;&s;engers, on the afternoon of the Fir&s;t-day, wherein we lay at anchor in Portland Bay. The prie&s;t in the morning, read pray|ers to the cabin pa&s;&s;engers, but took no care for the others on board. The captain offered us the cabin to meet in, but we rather cho&s;e to go to them in the &s;teerage; from which the prie&s;t would have di&s;&s;uaded us, by telling us, they would be likely to in&s;ult us; but, on our &s;ending a me&s;&s;age to the &s;ailors that we intend|ed them a vi&s;it, they returned for an&s;wer, that though they had not had college education, they &s;hould be glad to hear the word of God, and would readily admit us. The meeting
<PB N="66" REF="034371_0066_0FFC2D1295728638">
was attended with a good degree of &s;olemnity, and afforded &s;atisfaction to our&s;elves. My companion was favoured in te&s;timony &s;uited to the &s;tates of the people, and I was graciou&s;ly admitted to &s;upplicate the Lord for them.</P>
<P>Our other meetings were held in the cabin, which we had the u&s;e of for that purpo&s;e on the afternoons of the Fir&s;t-days, as the par&s;on had, in the mornings. They were generally attended by mo&s;t of the pa&s;&s;engers and &s;ome of the &s;ailors; but there being but little en|trance for the word, made it hard labouring among them. We were, however, favoured with peace, in endeavouring to promote their good; and ble&s;&s;ed with the incomes of divine life in our own &s;ouls, not only on tho&s;e occa&s;i|ons, but at many other times: &s;o that it was a &s;ea&s;on to be had in la&s;ting remembrance, with thank&s;giving to the Lord, who&s;e good pre&s;ence accompanied us when on the mighty ocean, and rendered our &s;eparation from our dear re|lations and friends ea&s;y.</P>
<P>The par&s;on, ob&s;erving that in our mini&s;try, we &s;poke extempore, told me that he could preach extempore, and we &s;hould hear him if we plea&s;ed the next Sunday. Accordingly when the day came, we were all &s;eated in the great cabin, and he preached without notes. His &s;ubject was the transfiguration of Chri&s;t, which he found a wonder,&mdash;expatiated upon it as a wonder,&mdash;and left it a wonder; with|out entering into the &s;pirituality of the text: indeed I doubt he did not under&s;tand it.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="034371_0067_0FFC2D1107829B80">From this time he read prayers and preach|ed on the Fir&s;t-day mornings, when the wea|ther permitted, and &s;ometimes we &s;at in the cabin with them; and although the incon&s;i&s;t|ency of their prayers and profe&s;&s;ions with their own &s;tates, as well as of the manner of their offering them with the nature of the &s;olemn duty of calling upon the Lord, joined to the prie&s;t's laboured, dry di&s;cour&s;es, could not but painfully affect us; yet in the time of their wor&s;hip, the Almighty by his power broke in upon our &s;pirits, and bowed them in contri|tion before him&s;elf: &s;o that, in the enjoyment of his goodne&s;s, we had a &s;ilent te&s;timony to bear to that living wor&s;hip which he in&s;pires, and accepts.</P>
<P>And although both by word and conduct we differed from the prie&s;t, we heard that when he came on &s;hore he &s;poke well of us, acknowledging that we had been in&s;truments of good to him; and particularly that my companion had convinced him of the evil of gaming; which he appeared to like whil&s;t on the voyage, but which we al&s;o heard he af|terwards preached zealou&s;ly again&s;t, as well as other vanities. Indeed he became much changed, and whil&s;t in Carolina appeared con|&s;cientiou&s;ly concerned for the people's wel|fare. Some time after we left America he returned to England, and I think I heard that the people did not like his clo&s;e doc|trine.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="034371_0068_0FFC2D0ECD32AD68">We lodged in Charle&s;ton at John Sin|clair's, who was educated among&s;t Friends, but had married one not of our Society. Both he and his wife received us kindly, and treated us while with them with great ho&s;pi|tality and genero&s;ity.</P>
<P>The meeting of Friends here was very &s;mall; and mo&s;t of tho&s;e who attended it were rather &s;tumbling-blocks, than way-marks, to other profe&s;&s;ors of religion; yet we found a few to whom we were mea&s;urably united, and who I believe were thankful for our vi&s;it. During our &s;tay in this place, we were treat|ed with great civility and kindne&s;s, by the inhabitants thereof who did not profe&s;s with us; but we &s;aw it nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;trictly guarded in our conver&s;ation with them; le&s;t their very re&s;pectful behaviour &s;hould betray us into a familiarity injurious to our&s;elves. Many of them are ready to hear the te&s;timony of Truth, but there is a certain lightne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition which greatly ob&s;tructs its progre&s;s among&s;t them; and if not carefully watched again&s;t, will infect the minds of per&s;ons who conver&s;e with them.</P>
<P>Many of them attended our meetings, and mo&s;tly behaved &s;oberly in them; but what with ignorance of the &s;pirituality of religion, a high profe&s;&s;ing &s;pirit in &s;ome, and libertin|i&s;m both in principle and practice in others, it was very hard to labour among&s;t them: however, the Almighty was plea&s;ed &s;o to fa|vour us, that we were not without hope,
<PB N="69" REF="034371_0069_0FFC2D0C952F2820">
that the te&s;timony given us to bear affected &s;ome minds, and, in the general, commanded their a&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>We had two &s;elect meetings for Friends, and paid a religious vi&s;it to mo&s;t of their fami|lies; in which &s;ervice we were owned by the power of Truth, though in &s;ome places we were very clo&s;ely exerci&s;ed; in&s;omuch, that one man ab&s;ented him&s;elf from meeting, not liking any longer to &s;it under our doctrine; but we found we had rather cau&s;e to rejoice than to be unea&s;y, in being in&s;trumental of &s;e|parating him from the Society (if &s;o it &s;hould prove), his conduct being a &s;candal to his pro|fe&s;&s;ion, though he pretended to join it by con|vincement.</P>
<P>We took a little turn to the &s;outh of Charle&s;|ton, and had meetings at James's I&s;land, John's I&s;land, and Stones. The fir&s;t was the mo&s;t &s;atisfactory.</P>
<P>At Stones, we had a clo&s;e exerci&s;ing time in the family of a young man, who&s;e father had formerly made profe&s;&s;ion of Truth; but he was quite gone from Friends, and I fear was tinctured with libertine principles; but he entertained us freely, and did not &s;eem to take offence at what we had to deliver. I heard he died &s;oon after. We had al&s;o a &s;a|tisfactory opportunity with a family not profe&s;|&s;ing with us, in Charle&s;ton, but who&s;e ance&s;|tors by the father's &s;ide were Friends.</P>
<P>It &s;eemed as though the Almighty had &s;ent us peculiarly to &s;eek the lo&s;t &s;heep of the hou&s;e
<PB N="70" REF="034371_0070_0FFC2D094FCB1740">
of I&s;rael: that his merciful vi&s;itation may be accepted by them, is the &s;incere de&s;ire of my &s;oul.</P>
<P>I was engaged to return to James's I&s;land, but, my companion having no concern to ac|company me, I went alone, and had a much larger meeting than when there before: and I hope it was well that I went back, as, through Divine favour, many go&s;pel truths were opened to the people, in a degree of life and authority.</P>
<P>My friend John Witter, of the I&s;land, &s;ent with me over the Sound a negro man, who was to attend me to my lodgings. He was well-dre&s;&s;ed, and looked well-fed. I entered a little into conver&s;ation with him re&s;pecting his &s;ituation as a &s;lave. He appeared ea&s;y in it, and &s;aid that he had a good ma&s;ter, but that many negroes were treated no better than dogs. Indeed we could not but lament over tho&s;e poor people, as we pa&s;&s;ed through the colonies. Divers of our friends were then in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome negroes, either by inherit|ance or purcha&s;e; and the negroes who had them for ma&s;ters rejoiced in their lot. But a|bout this time concern aro&s;e among&s;t Friends, to aboli&s;h &s;lave-keeping in our Society; which concern has &s;ince prevailed in the American Colonies; and many friends have given up large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in negroes, but employed many of them as hired &s;ervants after they had given them their liberty.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="034371_0071_0FFC2D07C016F6E8">We left Charle&s;ton the 26th of the Ele|venth month, accompanied by James Verree, a young man, a friend, re&s;iding there; and went towards a &s;mall &s;ettelement of Friends of the Wateree River, which is on the north &s;ide of the Province. They were lately come over from Ireland.</P>
<P>In our way we had meetings in the families of I&s;aac Perinoes, and John Lloyd where we lodged, who were neither of them of our Socie|ty, but they readily gave us an opportunity with them, and Truth favoured us.</P>
<P>Several difficulties attended us in this jour|ney. We had appointed a friend to meet us with hor&s;es, about a hundred and twenty miles from Charle&s;ton; and being &s;et to a time, we dur&s;t not &s;tay to di&s;charge our minds of that duty of love, which &s;eemed to point to|wards the people, as we went along. Second|ly, we had poor accommodation, e&s;pecially as to lodging; &s;ome of the hou&s;es being &s;o open to the air, that I could attribute our pre&s;erva|tion from great indi&s;po&s;ition, to nothing &s;hort of the mediate interpo&s;ition of Providence; but as the people behaved very civilly toward us, and we enjoyed &s;ome liberty of &s;pirit among them, it was rendered the more ea&s;y. When we came to the place where we had appointed to be met, we found neither the friend nor the hor&s;es; and tho&s;e which we brought from Charle&s;ton, being borrowed, and the friend who came with us being earne&s;t to return, we di&s;charged him from any further care of us,
<PB N="72" REF="034371_0072_0FFC2D04B8AABAA8">
&s;ent the hor&s;es back with him, and concluded to &s;tay at the hou&s;e of the before-mentioned John Lloyd; who was a &s;ub&s;tantial planter, and very freely gave us an invitation thereto, till our friends from the Wateree, could meet us with hor&s;es; unto whom we had an op|portunity of &s;ending an account of the &s;trait we were in, by a neighbour of theirs, whom we met at the hou&s;e of this planter, and who was then going home.</P>
<P>However, kind Providence &s;oon opened a way for our relea&s;e. A poor friend who lived be|tween this place and the Wateree, and was go|ing to Charle&s;ton with goods for the market, &s;topped at John Lloyd's; and, &s;eeing the cir|cum&s;tances we were in, left his load in John Lloyd's warehou&s;e, and returned back with us to his own hou&s;e; where we got a very poor lodging, but received it thankfully, as the be&s;t he could provide us with; and the next day he accompanied us to the Wateree, through a wilderne&s;s country, wherein it was dangerous for women to travel, by rea&s;on of the &s;wamps and deep creeks, which are difficult and very frightful to pa&s;s: but we were mer|cifully pre&s;erved from hurt.</P>
<P>We cro&s;&s;ed one creek upon the trunk of a tree laid from bank to bank, and the water was &s;o deep, that if the trunk had broken, we had probably been drowned. When we got on the other &s;ide we &s;aw it was decayed; and when our friends came over with our &s;addles upon their backs, we ob&s;erved it bend with
<PB N="73" REF="034371_0073_0FFC2D032C4DA8D8">
their weight. Our hor&s;es were driven through a part of the creek where the water was &s;hal|lower, yet perhaps there it was out of their depths. Providentially, before we cro&s;&s;ed this creek, we were met by our friend Robert Millhou&s;e: had it not been &s;o, I know not how the poor friend would have got us over.</P>
<P>Robert Millhou&s;e had brought hor&s;es for us, and gladly took us to his hou&s;e with him. My companion's former acquaintance with him in Ireland, rendered their meeting very agree|able. We found his not meeting us accord|ing to appointment, was occa&s;ioned by our let|ters not reaching him timely; which had we known, our &s;pirits might have been more at liberty to have attended the before mentioned pointings of love towards the people; but in|a&s;much as we had not wilfully omitted our du|ty, Divine mercy was extended, and our minds &s;oon became ea&s;y on that account.</P>
<P>We came to the Wateree River the 1&s;t of the Twelfth month, and &s;taid there till the 12th; in which time we attended Friends' meetings as they came in cour&s;e, both on the Fir&s;t, and other days of the week, and paid a religious vi&s;it to every family of Friends in the &s;ettle|ment; in which &s;ervice we were evidently owned by our Ma&s;ter; or at lea&s;t my compani|on was &s;o, who had mo&s;t of the &s;ervice in this place. The &s;tate of the friends &s;ettled here was mo&s;tly low, as to religious experience; but &s;ome of the youth were under a divine vi&s;itation, which afforded us &s;ome comfort.
<PB N="74" REF="034371_0074_0FFC2D00EBFCF898">
Some people not profe&s;&s;ing with us attended our meetings, and behaved &s;oberly; but in general, the people in this part of the country were lamentably ignorant and wicked: indeed, they had very few opportunities of religious in|&s;truction, no place of wor&s;hip being near; perhaps not nearer than twenty miles. Seldom, if ever, any clergyman came among&s;t them oftener than once a year, to &s;prinkle their children. Alas! what will the&s;e pretended and hireling &s;hep|herds have to an&s;wer for? of whom it may well be &s;aid,
<Q>they feed them&s;elves but not the flock.</Q></P>
<P>Indeed, none can feed the flock, who have not them&s;elves been fed by the heavenly Shepherd.</P>
<P>Part of the time we &s;pent here, was to me a &s;ea&s;on of deep inward trials; the enemy being &s;uffered &s;o to be&s;et me, that my &s;oul was di&s;tre&s;&s;ed both night and day; and though &s;ometimes a ray of hope of deliverance and pre&s;ervation would break in upon it, and I was favoured with a ta&s;te of divine love; yet when that was withdrawn, I was left as weak and unable to re&s;i&s;t him as before; &s;o that my &s;pirit was in inexpre&s;&s;ible bitterne&s;s.</P>
<P>I had very little &s;hare in the mini&s;terial &s;er|vice; &s;ometimes perhaps a few &s;imple expre&s;&s;i|ons. But before we left the Wateree, the load was in part removed, and my &s;pirit brought into a greater calm, in which I de|&s;ired to wait the Lord's time, to be put forth to &s;ervice. He had clothed me, and he had a
<PB N="75" REF="034371_0075_0FFC2CFD88B67BE8">
right to &s;trip me at his plea&s;ure; and I could &s;ay with Job,
<Q>The Lord gave, and taketh away, ble&s;&s;ed be his name.</Q>
The incomes of his love and peace in my heart, were more to me than to be honoured before the people. And here I cannot but again ob&s;erve the vari|ous bapti&s;ms which the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t have to pa&s;s through, in order to their being renewedly fitted to mini&s;ter to the different &s;tates of the people. What deep poverty and di&s;tre&s;s, doubts, fears, and temptations! I was &s;ometimes however in mercy admitted to ta&s;te of the cup of heavenly con&s;olation. All is con&s;i&s;tent with the wi&s;dom of God, and tends to bend the mind more effectually to|wards Him, and to mortify the fle&s;h with its corrupt affections: &s;o that the &s;piritual life is often &s;trengthened by the&s;e afflicting di&s;|pen&s;ations.</P>
<P>We bought hor&s;es at the Wateree, and, accom|panied by Robert Millhou&s;e and Samuel Kelly, &s;et forwards towards the River Peedee, where we had heard there was a &s;ettlement of Friends. We travelled through a wilderne&s;s country for &s;everal days, carrying provi&s;ions for our&s;elves and hor&s;es. In the day we took our repa&s;t in the woods, and at night got lodging at &s;ome planters'; who, though not of our So|ciety, readily gave us admittance into their hou&s;es, and freely entertained us according to their manner of living: and although it was very different from what we had been ac|cu&s;tomed to, and the lodging in &s;ome places
<PB N="76" REF="034371_0076_0FFC2CFBCF0002F8">
very cold and poor; we were content, and thankful to the Almighty for it, as well as for his providential care, variou&s;ly manife&s;ted in pre&s;erving us from the dangers which at|tended us, in pa&s;&s;ing &s;wamps, deep creeks, &amp;c. And although we lived low, our &s;pirits were pre&s;erved pretty cheerful, and our health tolerable.</P>
<P>One particular in&s;tance of Divine protection, I think worthy of commemoration. The 14th in the evening we came to a &s;wamp, which appeared very dangerous to cro&s;s; but a friendly man on the other &s;ide directed us where to turn our hor&s;es over, and came him|&s;elf and a&s;&s;i&s;ted us over &s;ome trees which lay acro&s;s it. Having got over, we a&s;ked him how far it was to the place where we intend|ed to lodge, and whether the way was ea&s;y to find. He told us it was twelve miles, and that the latter part of the way was intricate; and, after walking by our &s;ide a little time, he offered to conduct us, which offer we readily accepted. If he had not accompanied us, I know not but that we mu&s;t have been all night in the woods; for the way being &s;o difficult to find, and night coming upon us, we &s;hould probably have mi&s;&s;ed it; and the weather being fro&s;ty, and we unprovided ei|ther with materials to &s;trike fire, or blankets to cover us, we &s;hould have &s;uffered much, if we had e&s;caped with our lives.</P>
<P>Our kind guide brought us to the hou&s;e of James Gille&s;py, upon Peedee River; who
<PB N="77" REF="034371_0077_0FFC2CFA41D0C090">
was a &s;ub&s;tantial planter, and a ho&s;pitable man, I think by profe&s;&s;ion a Pre&s;byterian. His heart &s;eemed opened towards us. Of him we inquired after the &s;ettlement of Friends which we had heard of, but could get no in|telligence of it; yet were our minds mercifully pre&s;erved pretty ea&s;y and quiet, although we knew not which way we &s;hould &s;teer our cour&s;e from this place, being all of us &s;trangers in the country. In a &s;hort time, I found free|dom to propo&s;e to my companion, our hav|ing a meeting in the neighbourhood; with which &s;he concurring, we a&s;ked our kind ho&s;t, before we went to bed, whether he thought we might have a religious opportunity with &s;ome of his neighbours. He made but little reply then, but in the morning told Robert Millhou&s;e, that if we would &s;tay till Fir&s;t-day, we &s;hould be welcome both to what entertain|ment he could give us and our hor&s;es, and al&s;o to have a meeting in his hou&s;e; and he would &s;end his &s;ervant to acquaint his neigh|bours. To this we a&s;&s;ented, and &s;pent the next day peaceably there. On the Fir&s;t-day we had a meeting, which was not large, and, by rea&s;on of the ignorance of the people in divine truths, was exerci&s;ing to our minds. A young man, who came from the &s;ettlement of Friends which we were in que&s;t of, being in this neighbourhood on bu&s;ine&s;s, and hearing of the meeting, &s;taid to attend it. After it was over, he informed Robert Millhou&s;e, that &s;everal families of Friends were &s;ettled
<PB N="78" REF="034371_0078_0FFC2CF62690CD80">
about twenty miles up the river, to whom he was going the next day, and &s;hould be glad of our company. To this we readily a&s;&s;ented, and, being thus providentially in&s;tructed in our way, we next morning took leave of our kind friend James Gille&s;py, who had generou&s;ly en|tertained us while at his hou&s;e. We called at the hou&s;e where we had appointed to meet our expected guide; but it being a very wet morn|ing, he concluded we &s;hould not move, and was gone; however, we had got &s;uch intelli|gence from him of the way, that, with a little more which we obtained as we went along, we found the friend's hou&s;e to which we intended to go. He was a poor man lately convinced, but he gladly received us, and freely gave us &s;uch entertainment as his circum&s;tances would afford; which though very mean, was made ea&s;y and plea&s;ant to us, being &s;weetened by the gentle flowings of divine peace in our hearts.</P>
<P>We found here a few newly convinced friends, and &s;ome others under convincement; with whom we had two meetings to good &s;a|tisfaction, many things &s;uitable to their &s;tates being opened both by way of doctrine and en|couragement; and we were glad that we were thus directed to find them in this de&s;olate &s;pot; which was very di&s;tant from any Friends; but they were under the Divine regard. They had not &s;ettled a meeting; but as our guides from the Wateree were returning home, they found them bu&s;y in building a meeting-hou&s;e;
<PB N="79" REF="034371_0079_0FFC2CF49950D1D8">
and we afterwards heard that a meeting was &s;ettled among&s;t them.</P>
<P>The 20th, we left Peedee River, accom|panied by John and Charles Moreman, and the two friends who came with us from the Wateree, and &s;et our faces towards a &s;ettle|ment of Friends on the Waters of Haw River. The morning was wet when we &s;et out and I was very poorly; but in a little time the wea|ther cleared up, and I grew better. We rode that day about forty miles through the woods, without &s;eeing any hou&s;e; and at night took up our lodging in the woods, by the &s;ide of a branch or &s;wamp, which afforded plenty of canes for our hor&s;es. Our friends made us a little &s;hed of the branches of pine-trees, on a ri&s;ing &s;andy ground, which abounded with lof|ty pines. We made a large fire, and it being a calm, fair, moon-light night, we &s;pent it cheerfully, though we &s;lept but little. Our &s;addles were our pillows; and we had in com|pany a man, who came from Peedee and was going a part of our next day's journey, who&s;e wife had &s;ent a blanket; which, with one our friends had brought, being thrown at our backs upon our &s;hed &s;heltered us much; &s;o that we &s;till &s;aw kind Providence cared for us. In the morning we pur&s;ued our journey, and went that day about forty-five miles; and at night took up our lodging again in the woods, but did not meet with &s;o advantageous a &s;pot as the night before, for the ground was wet, and the &s;helter bad, and poor wood for firing.
<PB N="80" REF="034371_0080_0FFC2CF258AEE0D0">
The weather al&s;o being very cold, and my companion ill with a pain in her face, and my|&s;elf but poorly, we &s;pent the night very un|comfortably as to the body, but through di|vine favour were pre&s;erved quiet, and re&s;igned in &s;pirit.</P>
<P>We &s;et out next morning in hopes of reach|ing a &s;ettlement of Friends at new Garden that day; but the pain in my companion's face con|tinuing, we thought it be&s;t to &s;top at William Rinalds's at Polecat, who was under the pro|fe&s;&s;ion of Truth; and the next day, being the Fir&s;t of the week, we had a meeting there with a few friends, and &s;ome of the neigh|bours; which was exerci&s;ing, yet ended in a &s;en&s;e of Divine &s;weetne&s;s.</P>
<P>The 24th, we went to New Garden, and &s;taid among&s;t friends in that &s;ettlement till the 28th. This was a new &s;ettlement of Friends, and we were the fir&s;t from Europe that had vi&s;ited them, or travelled in the&s;e parts in the &s;ervice of Truth.</P>
<P>We had pretty clo&s;e &s;ervice among them, and laboured for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a meeting for mini&s;ters and elders in their monthly meet|ings; which we found was much wanting: and we had rea&s;on to hope that the propo&s;ition would be adopted; divers Friends being con|vinced of its u&s;efulne&s;s, and &s;eemed glad that it became our concern to recommend it. We found a &s;incere-hearted remnant in this meet|ing, unto whom the Lord united us; but there was al&s;o a dead, formal, profe&s;&s;ing &s;pirit,
<PB N="81" REF="034371_0081_0FFC2CF0149A0C40">
under which the living were &s;orely oppre&s;&s;ed; as well as under a fla&s;hy wordy mini&s;try.</P>
<P>The 29th, we got to Cane Creek, another new &s;ettlement of Friends; with whom we had a meeting the 30th, wherein we were rather low, yet favoured with peace in our &s;pirits.</P>
<P>The 31&s;t, we went about 30 miles to a very &s;mall meeting on the river Eno, which was very exerci&s;ing; for through their number was &s;mall, their &s;tates were various, and &s;ome of them widely di&s;tant from that pure, humble, living, &s;en&s;ible di&s;po&s;ition which Truth produces. And as it was the will of the Almighty, mea&s;ura|bly to bapti&s;e us into the &s;tates of the people, we could not but &s;uffer in &s;pirit with his pure &s;eed; and it &s;eemed as though a drawn &s;word was delivered to us in this the begining of our jour|ney, which we were to u&s;e again&s;t &s;piritual wickedne&s;s; and not to &s;pare, though it were exalted in high places. Here we laboured for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a Week-day meeting.</P>
<P>The 2d of the Fir&s;t month, 1754, my com|panion returned to Cane Creek, in order to be at their Week-day meeting; and I went about &s;ix miles up the River, being engaged to have a meeting among&s;t a people not pro|fe&s;&s;ing with us. Many came to it, and be|haved &s;oberly, but mo&s;t of them &s;eemed very ignorant of &s;piritual things; and &s;ome were heavy laden with divers &s;ins; but kind Provi|dence &s;o favoured me, that I left them pretty ea&s;y, and returned to my companion at Cane Creek, the 4th. The &s;ame day we had a
<PB N="82" REF="034371_0082_0FFC2CECEE0B1818">
meeting at Rocky River, which was &s;atisfac|tory, and we returned to Cane Creek, and were at the Fir&s;t-day meeting there.</P>
<P>The 7th, we &s;et out for Carver's Creek, a journey of about 160 miles, through an almo&s;t uninhabited country. We were accompanied by John Wright and J. Pigot, friends. The accommodation we met with was very mean, but rendered ea&s;y, under a &s;en&s;e of our being in the way of our duty. At one place where we lodged, the room wherein we lay was ex|po&s;ed to the weather on almo&s;t every &s;ide, and it being a wet night, the rain beat in up|on us in bed; but my mind was pre&s;erved in &s;weet peace, and under &s;ome degree of a &s;en&s;e of Divine favour. The woman of the hou&s;e was of a tender &s;pirit, and appeared to be &s;eeking after &s;ub&s;tantial good. I had con|&s;iderable freedom to &s;peak to her on religious &s;ubjects; which &s;he took well, and I was thankful that our lots were ca&s;t under that roof.</P>
<P>Another night, we lay in the woods, with tolerable comfort, though the weather was cold, and the ground damp. About two hours before we &s;topped, as I was attempting to cro&s;s a &s;wamp on &s;ome loo&s;e pieces of wood, one of them rolled, and threw me backward into it. One of our friends was leading me, and the other, &s;eeing me in danger of falling, &s;tepped behind me into the &s;wamp, and caught me, &s;o that I was wet but on one &s;ide, except my feet: and,
<PB N="83" REF="034371_0083_0FFC2CEB621C6C00">
although I mounted my hor&s;e immediately af|ter putting on a dry pair of &s;tockings, rode in my wet clothes, and lay down in them, I was pre&s;erved from taking cold. In the night two of our hor&s;es <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When travellers who lodge in the woods turn their hor&s;es to graze, they fa&s;ten a bell about each of their necks, and if they mi&s;s the &s;ound of any of them, they go to &s;ee whether they are not &s;trayed far from the &s;hed.</NOTE> &s;trayed away from us, and our guides were obliged to leave us and go in que&s;t of them; &s;o that we were &s;everal hours our&s;elves in this wilderne&s;s, &s;ur|rounded, for aught we knew, by bears, wolves, and panthers. Before we pitched our tent, I had been intimidated by an account which had been given me re&s;pecting the pan|thers infe&s;ting that quarter; one of which it was &s;aid had killed a per&s;on not very far di&s;tant from this &s;pot; but when we were thus left, all fear was removed, and we &s;pent the time of our friend's ab&s;ence cheerfully. I went without the &s;helter of our &s;hed, and renewed our fire with &s;ome wood our friends had gathered. The fire under Providence, was probably our pre&s;ervation from tho&s;e fe|rocious animals.</P>
<P>It was a fine moon-light night, our friends tracked our hor&s;es' foot&s;teps in the &s;and for about three miles in the way we had come, and found them feeding on &s;ome luxuriant
<PB N="84" REF="034371_0084_0FFC2CE91585C7E8">
canes. The &s;agacious animals probably ob|&s;erved them as they came to the &s;pot where we pitched our tent, and having but poor feeding there, went back to fill their bellies. As we proceeded on our journey, &s;ome of our company di&s;covered the track of a wild bea&s;t in the &s;and, which gave room to &s;u&s;pect that they had been near our tents in the night; but we were pre&s;erved both from their fury, and from being affrighted by their hideous howl. However, as we rode through the woods in the morning, we heard the barking of wolves at a &s;mall di&s;tance from us, but a ri&s;ing ground prevented us from &s;eeing them.</P>
<P>We breakfa&s;ted at a mi&s;erable inn, about eight or ten miles on our way; where we met &s;uch a wicked &s;et of company, who had &s;pent the night there, that we concluded it providential that we did not pre&s;s forward to lodge there; re&s;pecting which we were con&s;idering before we pitched our tent. It appeared much more comfortable to be under the open canopy of heaven, and the protec|tion of Providence, though among the wild bea&s;ts, than among tho&s;e of the human race, who&s;e natures were &s;o depraved as to render them more terrible and dangerous: the fir&s;t only (or at lea&s;t generally), a&s;&s;aulting man|kind of nece&s;&s;ity, or by provocation; but the la&s;t from the incitements of their depraved pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="034371_0085_0FFC2CE787D6D9E8">We went forward to Dunn's Creek, and had a &s;mall meeting, with a few under the profe&s;&s;ion of Truth; and from thence to Car|ver's Creek the &s;ame night, being the 12th. The 13th, we had a meeting there, and the 14th, went to Wilmington, on Cape Fear River, where we had two meetings the 15th. There are none in this place who can properly be called members of our &s;ociety, but many people came to the meetings, and behaved civilly; and the te&s;timony of Truth ran pretty freely towards them in doctrine, reproof, and coun&s;el; though I believe many of them were of very loo&s;e conver&s;ation. The 16th, we returned to Carver's Creek, &s;o to Brompton, Dunn's Creek, and Cape Fear.</P>
<P>The 20th, we proceeded towards Perqui|mons River, being accompanied by our friends William Hall and B. Cooper. We calculated our journey to Perquimons at 273 miles; go|ing acro&s;s the country to vi&s;it &s;everal &s;mall meetings of Friends; among&s;t whom, and the people of other &s;ocieties, we had &s;ome &s;atis|factory &s;ervice. No women-mini&s;ters had vi&s;it|ed part of this country before us, &s;o that the people were probably excited by curio&s;ity to attend &s;ome of the meetings we appointed. We found a few &s;eeking people in the&s;e back &s;ettlements, who had very little, even of what they e&s;teem, in&s;trumental help, in this wilder|ne&s;s country; which appears too poor for prie&s;tcraft to thrive in; but I hoped the Lord would gather &s;ome of them to faith in his
<PB N="86" REF="034371_0086_0FFC2CE3ADAB3538">
own immediate in&s;truction. In this journey we met with con&s;iderable hard&s;hips, the peo|ple among&s;t whom we were being very poor, their hou&s;es cold, and provi&s;ions mean. One night we lodged in a void hou&s;e on the River Neice. A man who kept a &s;tore on the other &s;ide of the river, gave us the liberty of it, &s;ent his negroes to make us a fire, and lent us a bed and coverings for it. We were content, although our provi&s;ions were &s;o near &s;pent that we had very little to refre&s;h our&s;elves with, after a hard day's journey; and we could get neither bread for our&s;elves, nor corn for our hor&s;es, for our money; as the man who lent us the hou&s;e and bed, would let us have none, though we &s;ent to reque&s;t it. Our friends William Hall and B. Cooper ac|companied us more than 100 miles in this journey.</P>
<P>On the 6th of the Second month, we reached Perquimons River, on which, and the River Pa&s;quatank, the main body of Friends in the province of North Carolina was &s;ettled.</P>
<P>Our fir&s;t meeting among them was at the Piney Woods meeting-hou&s;e, which was pret|ty large con&s;idering the &s;hortne&s;s of the time allowed to give notice of it; and the Lord was plea&s;ed to favour us with a good opportu|nity: the &s;pirits of &s;en&s;ible friends pre&s;ent were in a good degree &s;ettled, and I hope refre&s;hed. We vi&s;ited two other meetings in this quarter, in one of which neither of us had
<PB N="87" REF="034371_0087_0FFC2CE1294A9A38">
much publick &s;ervice. There is a number of valuable friends in this country, who were under &s;uffering from the prevalence of a &s;pirit of carnal ea&s;e, and al&s;o from the mini&s;try of &s;ome who will not be re&s;trained by whole&s;ome coun&s;el: wherewith a number are amu&s;ed ra|ther than profitably fed; and in&s;tead of being &s;olidly &s;ettled in a &s;ilent exerci&s;e of &s;pirit, they are in continual expectation of words, and remain in &s;orrowful ignorance of the opera|tion of Truth in them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Here it &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to go back a little, and give &s;ome account of an exerci&s;e which attended my mind, when about Carver's Creek. It was to part from my companion, and go the lower way through Bath Town, to the county of Perquimons; but the dif|ficulty of getting guides &s;uitable for us both, and an unwillingne&s;s to part from my compa|nion, con&s;idering the de&s;olate journey &s;he would have to go, and not being quite well in her health, determined me to accompany her; neverthele&s;s, I &s;tood open to be turned back when I had a &s;uitable evidence of its be|ing required. Here, an exerci&s;e re&s;pecting tho&s;e places being again revived, and being fearful of omitting my duty, I mentioned the going back to them to my companion, who, al|though &s;he was not free to accompany me, was ea&s;y with my going, and rather di&s;po&s;ed to en|courage me. Her health &s;eemed to require a little re&s;t, which &s;he purpo&s;ed to take at the hou&s;e of our friend Thomas Nichol&s;on of Little
<PB N="88" REF="034371_0088_0FFC2CDF9D1AD9F8">
River, who had not long &s;ince paid a religious vi&s;it to Friends in England. I then propo&s;ed it to Friends to &s;et forward the 11th, and if Providence permitted, to return to their quar|terly meeting in Pa&s;quatank county; to which they only objected, that they feared the notice was &s;o &s;hort, that they could not procure &s;uitable companions for me. However, they re&s;olved to mention it after the meeting on the 10th, and &s;ee if any friend would offer to go with me, to which I agreed; but told one of the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible among&s;t them, that if the way did not pretty readily open, I dur&s;t not pu&s;h much for it; which, con&s;idering the event, I was glad I had &s;aid.</P>
<P>After meeting, I was informed that two young men, and Rebecca Tombs, a valuable friend, and an acceptable mini&s;ter, were willing to accompany me. I did not find any objec|tion in my mind to accepting her company, though I had not reque&s;ted it; but an uncom|mon &s;en&s;e of &s;orrow &s;eized my &s;pirits; though I did not &s;ee that I ought to omit the journey, nor yet comprehend the cau&s;e of the exerci&s;e. Next morning I took leave of my companion Mary Pei&s;ley, in pretty much the &s;ame &s;tate of mind; and, after cro&s;&s;ing Perquimons River, we rode that day to Eden Town. On the road my mind became quiet, yet was low. The names of the young men who accompanied us were Nathaniel Newley and John White.</P>
<P>The 12th we had a meeting at Eden Town, which on account of the exce&s;&s;ive coldne&s;s of
<PB N="89" REF="034371_0089_0FFC2CDE11453FD8">
the weather, was not large, and it was much di&s;turbed by a wicked drunken man, while I was &s;peaking; with whom, being a litigious lawyer, the town's people were afraid to med|dle, le&s;t he &s;hould have an action again&s;t them: &s;o I was obliged to bear it, and the meeting concluded with le&s;s &s;olemnity than I could have wi&s;hed. I ob&s;erved a &s;erious look|ing woman in the meeting, and thought if &s;he a&s;ked me to her hou&s;e I &s;hould go; which &s;he did, and in the evening I went, accompa|nied by my companion. We found both her|&s;elf and her hu&s;band under a religious exer|ci&s;e; and &s;everal things were opened in me to &s;peak to them, which were well received, and I left them in a good degree of peace; be|lieving that the &s;ea&s;oning virtue of Truth had been felt in our conver&s;ation. There was no meeting of Friends in this town, and we lodged at an inn.</P>
<P>The 13th, in the morning, we cro&s;&s;ed a ferry, eight miles over. The weather was extreme|ly cold, which affected Rebecca Tombs much. The fro&s;t was &s;o hard, that the water in the Sound we had cro&s;&s;ed was frozen &s;ome di&s;tance from the &s;hore on each &s;ide, but we got through it &s;afe. We rode about twenty-five miles, lodged at a mean inn; and next morning early we &s;et out for Bath Town. When we had rode about &s;even miles, I had a fall from my hor&s;e, occa&s;ioned by the hor&s;e's &s;tarting at a bird flying out of a tree. I fell over the &s;addle, on my right arm, and the ground being very
<PB N="90" REF="034371_0090_0FFC2CDA2656C608">
hard from the fro&s;t, it was much hurt; but I e&s;teemed it a great favour that the bone was not broken. When we came to the next inn, my companion procured &s;ome wormwood with vinegar, and bound it round my arm; and we proceeded to Bath Town, though my arm gave me much pain.</P>
<P>I had &s;ome thoughts of cro&s;&s;ing the ferry here, which is four miles over, and &s;o proceed|ing to Newbern; but having received this hurt, and the wind being contrary, I became inclined to have a meeting here the next day. Ju&s;t as we alighted at the inn, a re&s;pectable looking man, who I afterwards found was an attorney, and lived about two miles out of town, came in; to whom I found freedom to impart our de&s;ire of having a meeting, and to con&s;ult him about a proper place to hold it in. He appeared well plea&s;ed with the propo&s;ition, and we concluded to hold it in the morning in the court-hou&s;e, if the wea|ther were warm enough to admit of the peo|ple's &s;itting there; if not, our landlord gave us the liberty of a room in his hou&s;e. I had much pain from my arm this afternoon; but &s;omenting it as before, it became ea&s;ier towards evening. Our meeting was attended next day by a pretty many people, mo&s;t of whom behaved with &s;obriety; but the life of religion was &s;carcely &s;o much as known by many of them; yet the Lord was plea&s;ed to open many go&s;pel truths to them; which were delivered under a feeling &s;en&s;e of their low ignorant &s;tate,
<PB N="91" REF="034371_0091_0FFC2CD89A7360A8">
and I tru&s;t had their &s;ervice. After this meet|ing, as I was returning to my inn, my mind &s;eemed drawn to return back to my companion Mary Pei&s;ley; and when I came to the inn, I found Rebecca Tombs, who had got thither before me, &s;eized with an ague; which brought a heavy weight of exerci&s;e upon my &s;pirit, and I &s;oon became apprehen&s;ive of her being removed by death. The &s;ame evening al&s;o one of the young men who came with us, was taken ill in the &s;ame way, and I was my&s;elf very poorly with a cold, which affected my head and throat. Next day Rebecca Tombs's indi&s;po&s;ition increa&s;ed, and I became very thoughtful whether I had be&s;t endeavour to remove her homewards, or continue her at Bath Town. There appeared to me danger of my incurring cen&s;ure from her relations, in acting either way. I therefore concluded it be&s;t to refer it to Providence, and &s;ee what turn it would take in her own mind. In the afternoon &s;he di&s;covered a de&s;ire to be remov|ed, and I found mo&s;t ea&s;e of mind in acting ac|cordingly.</P>
<P>I met in this town, to my &s;urpri&s;e, with a young woman who was daughter to a princi|pal trade&s;man of the neighbourhood of Dudley. She had been my &s;chool-fellow. Her hu&s;band, whom &s;he married in England, kept a &s;tore in this place. They &s;eeing our afflicted &s;ituation, readily furni&s;hed us with a chai&s;e for our re|turn; &s;o we prepared for going, and the at|torney before-mentioned generou&s;ly lent us a
<PB N="92" REF="034371_0092_0FFC2CD6172E43E0">
hor&s;e, and a negro-man to bring it back. He was at our inn in the evening. I went to him, and acknowledged his civility and kind|ne&s;s to us; and before we parted, we fell in|to a religious conver&s;ation, which I hoped might have its &s;ervice. Several per&s;ons were pre&s;ent, one of them the &s;heriff of the county, who had &s;ome &s;hare in the di&s;cour&s;e and offer|ed his hou&s;e to have a meeting in. The attor|ney &s;poke with great moderation, and made con&s;iderable conce&s;&s;ions re&s;pecting the cere|monial part of religion, and &s;eemed plea&s;ed with the information I gave him of the princi|ples and di&s;cipline of Friends; which I was re|markably opened to give &s;ome account of, and we parted friendly.</P>
<P>After he got home, he &s;ent me &s;ome wine to a&s;&s;i&s;t the friend in our journey (which nece&s;|&s;ity made an acceptable pre&s;ent, as we could buy none that was good in town), with a let|ter to reque&s;t that, if I &s;taid longer in the country than I expected, I would come to his hou&s;e; which I took kindly, and &s;uitably ac|knowledged his civility. I ju&s;t add re&s;pecting Bath Town, that the man of the inn, though he behaved civilly to us, appeared to be of a dark ferocious di&s;po&s;ition. One night a poor negro girl fell a&s;leep at the top of the &s;tairs, near our chamber door, and he &s;eeing her there kicked her down them. The poor girl cried out, but I did not hear that &s;he was wounded by the fall. Indeed darkne&s;s &s;eemed to &s;ur|round us in this hou&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="034371_0093_0FFC2CD2E5E2B718">The 17th, being the Fir&s;t-day of the week, we &s;et forward in the chai&s;e, and got eighteen miles on our way and lodged at the &s;ame hou&s;e of entertainment as we did when we came down; where we had very poor accom|modation. My friend was greatly fatigued, &s;he grew much wor&s;e that night, and next morning the young man that was unwell went to acquaint her hu&s;band with her indi&s;po&s;ition; but the Almighty did not &s;ee &s;it to continue her in pain till her hu&s;band came to her. Her pain was indeed extreme, and &s;oon effected the end for which it was de&s;igned; for the 20th in the morning, &s;he quietly expired. From near the fir&s;t of her being taken ill, &s;he had a &s;en&s;e that it would end in death, and was enabled to re&s;ign her&s;elf and her near connexions into the hands of Providence. She de&s;ired me to pen &s;ome memorandums of love and advice, to her hu&s;band, children, and re|lations; and then &s;aid, &s;he had nothing to do but to die. She &s;everal times expre&s;&s;ed her &s;atisfaction in having a clear con&s;cience, and I was convinced of her &s;pirit's centering in everla&s;ting ble&s;&s;edne&s;s. About twenty-four hours before &s;he departed, I was concerned to &s;upplicate the Almighty on her behalf, that he might be plea&s;ed to mitigate her pain, and grant her &s;pirit an ea&s;y pa&s;&s;age out of its af|flicted tabernacle: for which &s;he expre&s;&s;ed thankfulne&s;s; and in a &s;hort time her pain gra|dually abated, and her death was remarkably ea&s;y.

We got her bled, and made u&s;e of &s;uch other means as our circum&s;tances admitted; but &s;he was aver&s;e to having a doctor, nor do I think that one would have been of any &s;ervice to her.</P>
<P>Through this uncommon trial, my &s;pirit was &s;ingularly pre&s;erved in patience and &s;tability, though &s;ometimes inexpre&s;&s;ibly loaded. My health being but poorly, the fatigue I &s;u&s;tain|ed bore hard upon me; but I was enabled to di&s;charge my duty to my friend, and in the end witne&s;&s;ed the return of peace. My lodging was in the &s;ame room with her. I lay down in my clothes upon a bench by the fire-&s;ide, whereon the landlady laid &s;omething to render it the more ea&s;y. The young man who con|tinued with us behaved with remarkable com|po&s;ure, patience, and affection to the friend, who was his aunt, and I had rea&s;on to hope that the journey would be of la&s;ting &s;ervice to him.</P>
<P>The day &s;he departed we got a coffin made, and put the corps into it. Whil&s;t it was mak|ing, my neighbour Turton (brother to the young woman who kindly furni&s;hed us with the chai&s;e at Bath Town) came in, and was &s;urpri&s;ed to meet me here. As we had &s;ent back the chai&s;e, and he was going to his &s;i&s;ter's, he took charge of it. In the evening, I got a religious opportunity with the family at the inn; and the next morning &s;et off with the corps of my decea&s;ed friend. We had pro|cured the wheels of a cart to carry it on, and a man to drive it.</P>

<P>The 22d, we cro&s;&s;ed Perquimons River, and got the corps home; but the affecting &s;orrow|ful &s;cene of meeting the poor motherle&s;s chil|dren (of which there were &s;even), and other near relations and friends of the decea&s;ed, is difficult to de&s;cribe; nor &s;hall I attempt it, as the ideas it mu&s;t rai&s;e in a &s;en&s;ible mind, will &s;ufficiently repre&s;ent it.</P>
<P>That night I went to my companion Mary Pei&s;ley, and through mercy found her well at Thomas Nichol&s;on's; and next day we went to the quarterly meeting of Friends for the pro|vince
<PB N="96" REF="034371_0096_0FFC2CCEE6BFE048">
of North Carolina, held at Old Neck in Pa&s;quatank county. The meeting was large but exerci&s;ing, weakne&s;s being &s;en&s;ibly felt. I was favoured with a good opportunity a|mong&s;t Friends, wherewith I had rea&s;on to believe the &s;en&s;ible part of them had unity, and were thankful for it.</P>
<P>The 25th, we attended the meeting for mi|ni&s;ters and elders, and a large publick meeting, which though very exerci&s;ing in the beginning, ended well; for which favour we had renewed cau&s;e to ble&s;s the Almighty, who baptizes his mini&s;ters into the &s;tates of the people, and enables them to mini&s;ter thereto.</P>
<P>The 25th, we attended the funeral of Re|becca Tombs; and the meeting was large and crowned with &s;olemnity. After the meeting, a young man who kept the ferry at Perqui|mons River, de&s;ired to &s;peak with me. When I came over the ferry with the corps of Re|becca Tombs, he was with us in the boat, and while we were upon the water, my mind was affected on his behalf, &s;o much, that when we landed I took him a&s;ide and &s;poke clo&s;ely to him. What I &s;aid had &s;uch an ef|fect, that he told me, he could do no le&s;s than acknowledge the truth of it; and withal, that his mind was &s;o awakened thereby, that he could take no re&s;t &s;ince. I &s;aid what then aro&s;e in my heart to encourage him to endure the cha&s;ti&s;ing hand of the Lord, until his judgments had wrought their proper effect; and left him with thankfulne&s;s that I had
<PB N="97" REF="034371_0097_0FFC2CCD5C12D808">
been made in&s;trumental to awaken a poor pro|digal to a &s;en&s;e of his outgoings: for &s;uch I afterwards heard he was, though the &s;on of a friend in good e&s;teem.</P>
<P>Although I had been almo&s;t miraculou&s;ly &s;upported through the before recited trials, and had been enabled to mini&s;ter to many peo|ple as I pa&s;&s;ed along in my journey to Bath Town, and my return; yet con&s;idering all the circum&s;tances attending it, much cau&s;e for painful rumination was admini&s;tered. I might naturally query whether it were right for me to turn back, as the ends I had in view, viz. the vi&s;iting a few Friends in a de&s;olate &s;itua|tion, as well as having meetings at Eden Town and Bath Town, were in part fru&s;trated; and the afflicted ca&s;e of the decea&s;ed friend's nu|merous family, who, perhaps might have been &s;pared a little longer with them, had &s;he not gone with me, bore &s;o hard upon my mind, that, like Jonah, I wi&s;hed to die; but I quick|ly &s;aw, that in &s;o doing I erred greatly; for in that impatient &s;tate of mind I was not fit to enter into the &s;aint's re&s;t. After &s;ome time my mind &s;ettled in a good degree of quiet, and it appeared that perhaps the de&s;ign of Infinite Wi&s;dom, in engaging me to move, as before mentioned, might, in a good degree, be an|&s;wered. And as to Rebecca Tombs, &s;he ap|peared to be in &s;o weak a &s;tate when &s;he left home, that had &s;he &s;taid there, her &s;urviving that pinching &s;ea&s;on of the weather might well be doubted.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="034371_0098_0FFC2CC976A80CD8">The 26th we left the province of North Carolina, and came into Virginia, and the Lord was plea&s;ed to cau&s;e his peace &s;o to re&s;t upon our &s;pirits, that we were renewedly con|vinced, that we were moving in his coun&s;el. We had travelled upwards of a thou&s;and miles in North Carolina, and been pre&s;erved through various jeopardies and trials, to the prai&s;e of his adorable name.</P>
<P>The 27th we had our fir&s;t meeting in Virgi|nia, wherein the te&s;timony of truth was borne in a clo&s;e manner by both of us, again&s;t a dull inactive &s;pirit, and appeared to have &s;ome pre|&s;ent effect.</P>
<P>The 28th we went to Nancemond River, and vi&s;ited &s;everal meetings on it, and adjacent to it; wherein we were &s;till exerci&s;ed to &s;peak clo&s;ely to the members of them; which I be|lieve tended to the relief of the &s;en&s;ible part of Friends. In one of the&s;e meetings, having been clo&s;ely engaged in te&s;timony, I caution|ed friends to beware of judging me for the liberty which I took among&s;t them, in laying open the &s;tate of the &s;ociety, although &s;ome of other &s;ocieties were pre&s;ent; remarking, that it was more likely to convince con&s;iderate people of the truth, than to hear them &s;alved over in their &s;ins. I concluded with &s;ome &s;hort remarks and hints of advice to &s;uch as were not under our name, which I &s;uppo&s;e had its effect on a pretty high profe&s;&s;or of the church of England, who accidentally came into the meeting; for the next day he followed us &s;even

miles to a meeting, wherein I was told he was much broken into tears; and the day follow|ing he came about twelve miles to another meeting; I therefore hoped that the Truth had been at work in his heart. I record this pa&s;&s;age as an incitement to a faithful di&s;charge of duty in the line the All-wi&s;e Director of true mini&s;ters points out. He can make effec|tual a few &s;imple expre&s;&s;ions to the gathering of tho&s;e who are without; or even &s;anctify to them the doctrine which may be lo&s;t on the unfaithful profe&s;&s;ors of his truth.</P>
<P>The 17th of the Third month, we had a meeting at Surry Black Water, which was large; Friends from the neighbouring meet|ings, and many per&s;ons of other &s;ocieties, col|lecting at it. After the meeting, a pretty high profe&s;&s;or of the church of England (his name Peter Worrel), but who for &s;ome years had been di&s;&s;atisfied therewith, and had been &s;eeking the way of Truth, &s;ought an opportu|nity of conver&s;ation with us. He had follow|ed us to &s;everal meetings, and being &s;erious in his inquiries, and free in expre&s;&s;ing his &s;en|timents, he told my companion (who had had mo&s;t of the &s;ervice in the meetings he had at|tended), that he could not di&s;cover much dif|ference between the ground of the doctrine he had heard from her, and the fundamental principles of the church of England. I &s;aw his &s;tate, that he heard with his bodily ears, and judged by his natural under&s;tanding, of which he had a good &s;hare, and had read
<PB N="100" REF="034371_0100_0FFC2EA597FD76D8">
much. I therefore told him, that if he would attain the knowledge of the Truth, he mu&s;t not only under&s;tand the words which were &s;poken, but the power whereby they were given forth; for that, according to the Apo&s;tle's te&s;timony,
<Q>The kingdom of God &s;tands not in word, but in power,</Q>
which, with &s;omething el&s;e I &s;aid, adapted to his ca&s;e, was carried home beyond my expectation. He followed us to another meeting, and then &s;ought an oppor|tunity with me alone; when he told me, that what I had dropped in conver&s;ation, and that day in my mini&s;try, had &s;o affected him, that he was now convinced that a Divine power ac|companied true go&s;pel mini&s;try, and that he thought he &s;hould join with us in &s;ociety; but that he was under &s;ome di&s;couragement on ac|count of the degeneracy of many of our mem|bers. I &s;aid what then aro&s;e in my heart, by way of exciting him to faithfulne&s;s; and he parted from us in much love: indeed he was remarkably changed from the time we fir&s;t &s;aw him; his very countenance be&s;poke him to have been with Je&s;us. He was &s;ilent, &s;olid, and weighty in &s;pirit, though before talkative and full of head-knowledge in religion. I af|terwards heard well of him, and I think he &s;ettled among&s;t Friends.</P>
<P>I could not but remark on this occa&s;ion, how &s;ecretly, and almo&s;t unknown to our|&s;elves, the Almighty &s;ometimes makes u&s;e of us to the effecting of his gracious purpo&s;es: for in the meetings this man had attended,
<PB N="101" REF="034371_0101_0FFA6C8F575A4D50">
previou&s;ly to our conver&s;ation with him, I was much &s;hut up as to mini&s;try; and my com|panion was favoured in the exerci&s;e of her gift; in one of them remarkably &s;o; and yet it appeared that I was made the principal in|&s;trument of good to this poor &s;eeking &s;oul.</P>
<P>We then vi&s;ited &s;everal meetings upon Ap|pomatox River; and the Lord was with us, ble&s;&s;ed be his name; thence to the South-we&s;t Mountains, where we were led in a very low track, my&s;elf e&s;pecially. Thence we proceed|ed through many meetings to James River, and &s;o to the quarterly meeting at Wyanoak Swamp. By the time I came to James River, I was &s;unk exceedingly low in mind; but as I abode in the patience, the Lord, in his time, was plea&s;ed to rai&s;e me again to his own ho|nour. From James River, we went through many meetings in Carolina County, up Sher|rando River, and by Opeekan Creek to Fair-fax, which was the la&s;t meeting we had in Virginia.</P>
<P>In this Colony we had much &s;uffering of &s;pirit, for, although in many in&s;tances we were favoured with a good degree of &s;trength and wi&s;dom, to &s;peak to the &s;tates of the people; yet could we not but &s;ympathize with the &s;eed of life, which in many of their &s;ouls was op|pre&s;&s;ed by a dark carnal &s;pirit: wherein the di&s;cipline is too much conducted, or rather in &s;ome places &s;o perverted, that this de&s;igned wall of defence, is rather a &s;tumbling-block to &s;ober inquiries. There are a number of
<PB N="102" REF="034371_0102_0FFA6C9448B366D8">
valuable friends among them; but in &s;ome particulars, who, had they kept to the &s;im|plicity of Truth, might have been &s;erviceable in the mini&s;try; &s;ound and flight are grievou&s;|ly mixed therein, which will never convince the judgment, or &s;ettle the mind in the &s;tability of Truth, although they may plea&s;e the ear, and affect the pa&s;&s;ions. After leaving the province, we &s;ent them an epi&s;tle, which was principally penned by my companion</P>
<P>I think a providential pre&s;ervation which we experienced in this province worthy record|ing, but, not having retained it in the memo|randums I have pre&s;erved, I cannot a&s;certain the name of the river at which it happened. After a long day's journey, wherein we had dined in the woods on a &s;canty meal, we came in the evening to the ford of a broad, rapid river, which, from the appearance of the waves, we might &s;uppo&s;e had a &s;tony bot|tom. Neither of our guides were acquainted with the ford, and we were afraid to attempt to cro&s;s it until it was tried by one of them: &s;o the younge&s;t of them, about 19, went ra|ther beyond the middle of the &s;tream; and not finding it very deep, called to us to follow, which we with the other guide did, when each of them took charge of one of us.</P>
<P>My companion followed him who went fir&s;t, and they kept a pretty &s;traight cour&s;e acro&s;s the river; but my hor&s;e, and that of the other friend, bended down the &s;tream, which I con|cluded was occa&s;ioned by its force and rapidi|ty.
<PB N="103" REF="034371_0103_0FFA6CB19FFD25E0">
When we got over, we learned that the bed of the river, which was of large pebbles, was &s;o uneven as to render it dangerous. To ford it &s;afely, the hor&s;es &s;hould have gone a little way down the &s;tream, and turned up a|gain to the landing place; for by going &s;traight acro&s;s, the edge of a pit in the bottom mu&s;t be gone over, which was accounted thirty feet deep, &s;o that my companion was in con&s;idera|ble danger. Surely much caution is nece&s;&s;ary for travellers in cro&s;&s;ing unknown waters.</P>
<P>The 25th of the Fourth month we had a meeting at Monocca&s;y in Maryland, wherein Truth mea&s;urably favoured; from which we proceeded to We&s;t River, taking the meetings in our way. We came to We&s;t River the 29th, and could not get a relea&s;e from thence till the 8th of the Fifth month. The profe&s;&s;ors of Truth in this &s;ettlement are principally of the offspring of faithful ance&s;tors; but divers of them have taken their flight on the wings of vanity and earthly riches, and &s;lighted the truly valuable eternal inheritance; and, I fear, &s;ome even de&s;pi&s;e that precious faith which was once delivered to the &s;aints. We had &s;ix meetings with them, in four of which I was &s;ilent; and my companion had not much liberty of &s;pirit until the la&s;t meeting; where|in the te&s;timony of Truth was rai&s;ed in its own dominion. The yearly meeting for this part of Maryland was held during our &s;tay; which, as u&s;ual, was attended by people of other &s;ocieties, and, I heard there was a great
<PB N="104" REF="034371_0104_0FFC2EA409C799E0">
de&s;ire to hear me &s;peak in this place; but the Lord was plea&s;ed very much to di&s;appoint their expectation.</P>
<P>The 8th we went to Gerrard Hopkins's, upon South River: in the way I had a dan|gerous fall from my hor&s;e, whereby my left arm was much hurt, but, through Divine fa|vour, no bone was broken or di&s;located.</P>
<P>The 9th, we proceeded on our journey, al|though my arm was &s;o weak and painful that I was obliged to carry it in a &s;ling. We pa&s;&s;|ed through &s;everal meetings in Baltimore county, to Duck Creek and Bu&s;h River, and in many places my companion had good &s;er|vice; but great were my trials of &s;pirit about this time, under which the Divine arm &s;ecret|ly &s;u&s;tained me. Oh! what need is there to &s;tand &s;till in the&s;e &s;tripping, dipping &s;ea&s;ons, and wait low to di&s;cern the way whereby we may e&s;cape the temptations of the &s;ubtil enemy. As I was favoured to abide here, a little light and &s;trength was afforded; whereby I was en|couraged to tru&s;t in that arm of Almighty &s;ufficiency which had hitherto pre&s;erved me; and was re&s;igned to travel forward, although I might be led in a low de&s;pi&s;ed track.</P>
<P>The 18th, we came to Su&s;quehannah River, and the 19th, to Ea&s;t Nottingham in Penn&s;ylva|nia, to the hou&s;e of my dear and worthy friend John Churchman, who was not yet returned from a vi&s;it to Friends in England; but his wife and &s;on gladly received us. The 22d we reached Philadelphia, and took up our
<PB N="105" REF="034371_0105_0FFC2EA1DD5CE820">
lodging with our worthy and ancient friend Rachel Pemberton.</P>
<P>Here my dear companion met with a trial very affecting to nature, an account of the death of her father; which however &s;he was the better prepared to receive, from a remark|able &s;en&s;e having for &s;ome time re&s;ted upon her mind that it was &s;o; and &s;he was a&s;&s;i&s;t|ed to bear it with Chri&s;tian re&s;ignation and fortitude, being favoured with the cheering hope that he went well.</P>
<P>We &s;taid in Philadelphia till the 29th, at|tending the meetings of Friends as they came in cour&s;e, wherein I had &s;ome &s;ervice, and was favoured with peace in the di&s;charge of my duty, though led in a low track, very contrary to the expectations of the people, which were to be di&s;appointed. My com|panion was mo&s;tly &s;ilent during our &s;tay in this city.</P>
<P>The 29th we left Philadelphia, and &s;et our faces towards the ea&s;tern colonies. We ap|pointed but one meeting between Philadel|phia and New York; where we had two large publick meetings, which were attend|ed by many people of other &s;ocieties; who behaved well, and the te&s;timony of Truth was borne to them by us both. In the evening my companion had an inclination to have a &s;elect opportunity with Friends in that city; which, I believe, was memorable to &s;ome pre&s;ent, for &s;he was much favoured among&s;t them.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="034371_0106_0FFC2E9F14ACADC8">On the 3d of the Sixth month, we cro&s;&s;ed the river to Long I&s;land; and the 5th, had a &s;mall meeting with a few who profe&s;&s;ed the truth at Setoket, and &s;o proceeded to the ea&s;t end of the i&s;land, intending to go from thence to the yearly meeting in Rhode I&s;land. We were accompanied by two Friends from Phila|delphia, John Aimil and Thomas Lightfoot, and one from Setoket. Here we were detain|ed near two days by contrary winds, and lodged at the hou&s;e of a friendly man, a Pre&s;|byterian, but more generous in his way of thinking than are many of that profe&s;&s;ion in this I&s;land. I had a concern to have a meet|ing with the neighbours, and a young man kindly offered his hou&s;e; which we accepted, and a pretty many people came, and behaved well while I was &s;peaking; but very &s;oon af|ter I had done, mo&s;t of them went away, although the meeting was not yet concluded. The Almighty was plea&s;ed to cau&s;e many go&s;pel truths to be opened to them, and al|though it &s;eemed to take too little effect, I had peace in the di&s;charge of my duty.</P>
<P>On the 8th, we &s;et &s;ail in a &s;loop, but the wind not favouring, we dropt anchor that night, and next day, being the Fir&s;t of the week, went on &s;hore at a place about two miles di&s;tant from whence we embark|ed. Here we were received by another Pre&s;|byterian, and that day were favoured with a comfortable religious opportunity together. The wind continued contrary to the 12th,
<PB N="107" REF="034371_0107_0FFC2E9CE734E938">
in which interval we had a meeting with &s;ome of the neighbours; which, although exerci&s;ing by rea&s;on of the hardne&s;s of their hearts, was favoured by Divine conde&s;cen&s;i|on; many go&s;pel truths being te&s;tified to therein, which I hope had admittance in &s;ome minds.</P>
<P>The 12th, early in the morning we &s;ail|ed, accompanied by the before-mentioned friends, and landed on Rhode I&s;land in the afternoon.</P>
<P>The 13th, we attended a large meeting at Port&s;mouth. The 14th, the yearly meeting began, which was held at Newport, and con|tinued till the 17th. It was attended by a large number of Friends and others; and the Lord was plea&s;ed to manife&s;t his ancient love and power among&s;t us, whereby our &s;pirits were &s;et at liberty in the exerci&s;e of our gifts. I had particularly, at divers times, to oppo&s;e that dark principle of unconditional election and reprobation, and had cau&s;e to hope the te&s;timony again&s;t it had weight with &s;ome of its profe&s;&s;ors. We were exerci&s;ed for the re&s;|toration of di&s;cipline, which had been much neglected in this quarter; and our endeavours for its e&s;tabli&s;hment were mea&s;urably crowned with &s;ucce&s;s; &s;o that, upon the whole, at this yearly meeting abundant cau&s;e was admini&s;ter|ed for thankfulne&s;s to the bounteous Author of all good. We vi&s;ited the pri&s;on; we al&s;o vi&s;ited &s;everal friends who were confined

through indi&s;po&s;ition; in which charitable &s;ervice we had peace and comfort.</P>
<P>The 19th, we went to Tiverton, and &s;o, through &s;everal meetings in that quarter, to the monthly meeting at Ponigan&s;et, wherein we were exceeding clo&s;ely exerci&s;ed; the te&s;|timony principally directed to Friends.</P>
<P>After we left Newport, my mind was much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and drawn back to that place, but my companion not encouraging me, and I be|ing fearful, did not return, which I had after|wards rea&s;on to believe I ought to have done; for after our leaving it, a young man whom we had vi&s;ited in his illne&s;s died. He was of con&s;iderable account in the world, and ju&s;t upon the point of marriage with an agree|able young woman of the &s;ame meeting. Had I moved in faith, I might have got to his funeral.</P>
<P>It is worthy remarking, that while I was under the exerci&s;e for returning back, two friends came to vi&s;it us, and my companion being engaged above &s;tairs, I was with them alone a &s;hort time. We &s;at a few minutes in &s;ilence, when one of them &s;aid,
<Q>Go down to the camp and &s;ee,</Q>
without any com|ment upon the expre&s;&s;ion. I had doubtle&s;s been ruminating why my mind &s;hould be drawn back; and had I attended to this in|timation, and &s;et off immediately, I might, with clo&s;e riding, have reached the before|mentioned funeral, and have returned in &s;ea|&s;on to the monthly meeting at Ponigan&s;et;
<PB N="109" REF="034371_0109_0FFC2E99134BF4E8">
whereto, as Friends of the particular meetings re&s;orted, all the &s;ervice required of me might have been an&s;wered.</P>
<P>The 28th, we went on board a &s;loop, and &s;ailed for the I&s;land of Nantucket. We in|tended, by Divine permi&s;&s;ion, to have attend|ed the yearly meeting there, but the wind proving contrary, we did not get there till the 30th, when the meeting was in part over. We went on &s;hore for a few hours on Elizabeth I&s;land, where we &s;aw no inhabitant; but it being a fine &s;un-&s;hine day, and the ground ri&s;ing from the &s;ea, we laid our&s;elves down upon the turf, and got a little &s;leep; for the &s;loop was &s;o crouded, being &s;mall, that we could get very little on board. At Nan|tucket we met our friends Daniel Stanton, I&s;|rael Pemberton, &amp;c. from Philadelphia, who had all been with us at the yearly meeting at Rhode I&s;land. We were mutually refre&s;hed together, and the Lord favoured us in his &s;ervice, both in the work of the mini&s;try and in di&s;cipline; to the &s;atisfaction and relief of the &s;en&s;ible body of Friends, and I hope to the edification of &s;ome others.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of this I&s;land were favoured with wonderful vi&s;itations from on high, at the time when our valuable friends John Richard&s;on and others vi&s;ited America; by who&s;e labours as mini&s;ters, a large meeting was gathered to the prai&s;e of the Lord's name; which wrought powerfully to the turning the people from "darkne&s;s to light:"
<PB N="110" REF="034371_0110_0FFC2E962AE70C28">
and many worthy profe&s;&s;ors of Truth then belonged to it, men and women zealous for the honour of it, who walked in that true light wherein they had believed. But mo&s;t of the&s;e being removed to their eternal man|&s;ions, and their offspring not generally walk|ing by the &s;ame rule, our &s;ociety was in a &s;tate of weakne&s;s, although the meeting was yet large, and there remained a living remnant in it. Some of the youth, e&s;pecially of our own &s;ex, appeared hopeful; but having been left much to them&s;elves, and the work of the di&s;cipline having been neglected, they were unprepared for it, and ignorant of its weight and nece&s;&s;ity; &s;o that the meeting &s;eemed in a dwindling condition, as to the life of Truth. We laboured for an amendment in the&s;e re|&s;pects; and in order thereto, recommended their bringing the young people of orderly conver&s;ations to their meetings for bu&s;ine&s;s (which had been too much neglected); with which Friends concurred, and al&s;o with the propo&s;ition for their holding two meetings for wor&s;hip on the Fir&s;t-day; whereby the time, which was too frequently &s;quandered away un|profitably, by at lea&s;t many of the younger &s;ort, might be better employed. Some of the members of the meeting living di&s;tant from it, had probably prevented their holding two meetings heretofore on the Fir&s;t-day; but that was no excu&s;e for tho&s;e who dwelt in the town.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="034371_0111_0FFC2E949F9CAE90">We left the I&s;land in peace, in the after|noon of the 1&s;t of the Seventh month, in com|pany with our afor&s;aid friends from Philadel|phia, and landed at Wood&s;hold the &s;ame even|ing; whence Daniel Stanton and I&s;rael Pem|berton returned homewards, but the other friend, not being quite ea&s;y to leave us, con|cluded, with our permi&s;&s;ion&punc; to accompany us a little further. He was one of tho&s;e who came with us from Philadelphia as guide, and had accompanied us to Rhode I&s;land, and while with us, had been remarkably under the baptizing power of Truth; which rai&s;ed a tender regard in our minds towards him, and we were not ea&s;y to refu&s;e his company, al|though he was in a &s;ingle &s;tation. Our Friends al&s;o of Philadelphia, who left us here, concurred in his &s;tay, and that the more freely, as &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance might be wanted in &s;ome places we were about to pa&s;s through.</P>
<P>Here I &s;ugge&s;t &s;ome cautions nece&s;&s;ary to be ob&s;erved by young women in a &s;ingle &s;tate, who travel in the &s;ervice of the mini&s;try, to|wards tho&s;e of the other &s;ex, who are al&s;o unmarried.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, to guard their own minds, le&s;t they admit of any plea&s;ing imagination, and &s;tamp it with the awful name of revelation; and &s;o &s;lide into a familiarity and freedom of con|ver&s;ation and behaviour, which might tend to engage the affections of young men. Secondly, to endeavour to retain a feeling &s;en&s;e of the &s;tate of the &s;pirits of tho&s;e with whom they are in|timate,
<PB N="112" REF="034371_0112_0FFC2E927575E5D8">
and &s;trictly to ob&s;erve their conduct and behaviour towards them: &s;o will they be the better able to judge of their motives for accompanying them, or of any other act of kindne&s;s; and may wi&s;ely check any for|ward thought which looks beyond friend&s;hip; which my ea&s;ily be done by &s;ome prudent re|marks (yet obliquely) in conver&s;ation. Third|ly, to beware of hurting any of the&s;e ten|der plants by an au&s;tere conduct. When we are &s;ingularly made in&s;truments of good, in the hand of Providence, to any &s;oul, there is a natural aptitude to lean a little to the in&s;tru|ment, and to prefer it above others, which for a time may be allowable. The Lord, lead|ing the mind by gradual &s;teps from the love of other objects to the entire love of him&s;elf, the one only pure, eternal, Excellency, may per|mit it for a &s;ea&s;on to lean to an in&s;trument; in which ca&s;e a prudent re&s;erve is nece&s;&s;ary, as well as a tender regard to the growth of the party thus vi&s;ited. I confe&s;s, it is &s;ometimes a nice point, to be ready to be of &s;ervice to &s;uch, and pre&s;erve the unity of the &s;pirit, free from mixture of natural affection; a di&s;tinc|tion which I fear has been overlooked by &s;ome to their great hurt, but which Truth, if adher|ed to, will make; and will al&s;o direct to &s;teer &s;afely betwixt the&s;e dangerous extremes.</P>
<P>From Wood&s;hold we went to Falmouth, and &s;o to the quarterly meeting at Sandwich, which began the 5th of the Seventh month. It was &s;mall and exerci&s;ing, but we were favoured
<PB N="113" REF="034371_0113_0FFC2E90314F5638">
with Divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, through which the te&s;|timony of Truth was &s;et over the heads of the gain&s;ayers.</P>
<P>From hence we went to Yarmouth, where we had a good meeting with a few Friends, and a pretty many of the neighbours, and returned back to Sandwich.</P>
<P>The 10th, we had a meeting at Pembroke, which was attended by many people of other &s;ocieties, who were much di&s;plea&s;ed becau&s;e we were &s;ilent. In the evening we had a meeting with a few friends; the principal &s;ervice whereof was to &s;trengthen their hands in the di&s;cipline.</P>
<P>The 11th, we went to Bo&s;ton, and had a meeting there with Friends and &s;ome others the &s;ame evening, which ended comforta|bly.</P>
<P>The 12th, our friend of Philadelphia left us to return home, and we pur&s;ued our journey towards the quarterly meeting, to be held at Hampton the 13th and 14th, and with hard travelling we reached it in due time. But &s;uch a &s;cene of confu&s;ion and di&s;traction I never was in before; occa&s;ioned by a company of Ranters, who had gone out from Friends in a &s;pirit of &s;eparation; but who, in reality, were never properly of us, having been in|judiciou&s;ly taken into member&s;hip, before Friends knew on what foundation they were; and being high-minded, heady, and exceeding|ly wild in their imaginations (which they ac|counted revelations), would not &s;ubmit to the
<PB N="114" REF="034371_0114_0FFC2E8D49E1F010">
&s;en&s;e of Friends in the di&s;cipline, and were therefore di&s;owned. The&s;e frequently made it their practice to di&s;turb the meetings of Friends, with their wild di&s;orderly appearan|ces; and many of them came to this quarter|ly meeting, again&s;t whom we had to te&s;tify, be|ing in the cour&s;e of the meetings exceedingly burdened with their &s;pirits and publick ap|pearances under pretence of preaching; but we were obliged to &s;uffer under their &s;pirits, until our concluding meeting, whereto many of them came. After a time of &s;ilence there|in, my companion &s;tood up, and one of their company began haranguing the people in the grave-yard, and others were di&s;turbing Friends in the meeting hou&s;e; wherein I think a form broke down, whereby the di&s;|turbance became &s;o great, that &s;he &s;at down in di&s;couragement, and the meeting continued in di&s;order. In a &s;hort time I &s;tood up with a view to inform the people pre&s;ent who did not profe&s;s with us (who were numerous), of the rea&s;on of our conduct towards the&s;e Ranters. I had &s;aid but little before I was &s;en&s;ible of the &s;pring of Divine life being opened; from whence I was enabled to mi|ni&s;ter, though I had no view of what was given me to &s;peak before I &s;tood up; but I was immediately and mercifully clothed with &s;uch a degree of authority, that it might in|deed be &s;aid, the Truth was over all, and the meeting ended in awful &s;olemnity: for
<PB N="115" REF="034371_0115_0FFC2E8B03436360">
which my &s;oul was humbly thankful to the Lord, who gave us victory over the&s;e delud|ed &s;pirits.</P>
<P>The 16th, we went to Dover, and had two meetings with Friends in that quarter, in both of which I was &s;hut up. We attended the funeral of a friend who&s;e relations were Pre&s;|byterians, and had a &s;ea&s;onable opportunity among the people, wherein the te&s;timony of Truth was exalted.</P>
<P>The 20th, we had a meeting with Friends at Thomas Hen&s;on's; and thence went to Berwick and Winter Harbour, whence we cro&s;&s;ed part of Ca&s;co Bay in a canoe, to vi&s;it a few friends on &s;ome i&s;lands therein. Seve|ral friends from Dover, &amp;c. accompanied us in this journey; wherein had human fears prevailed, we might have apprehended our|&s;elves in danger from the Indians, who &s;ome|times annoy the inhabitants, killing &s;ome, and carrying others captive to Canada: but our &s;pirits were mercifully pre&s;erved above fear, and comforted with the hope of Truth's pro&s;perity among the few friends in that quar|ter; &s;everal of whom were under its humbling vi&s;itation, and therefore were near to our &s;pi|rits; from whom we departed in go&s;pel love, and returned to Dover the 30th.</P>
<P>The 1&s;t of the Eighth month, we went to New Town, had a meeting at Nathan Hoeg's, wherein much in&s;tructive doctrine flowed to &s;everal &s;tates, particularly to that of the be|fore mentioned Ranters; and we found that
<PB N="116" REF="034371_0116_0FFC2E895F911DA0">
there were pre&s;ent two young women who &s;ometimes went among them, with whom, af|ter meeting, we had &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e. They behaved civilly to us, and told us they had heard many lies of us; and one of them was con&s;iderably tendered in &s;pirit, but the other was high in imagination.</P>
<P>From hence we proceeded to Alm&s;bury and Newbury, where a concern re&s;ted upon my dear companion to go back, and pay a vi&s;it in the love of the go&s;pel to the&s;e Ran|ters, for whom &s;he had for &s;ome time been ex|erci&s;ed, and particularly for their leader James Bean; a man of great cunning and a &s;trong will, who had heretofore been &s;uffered to mi|ni&s;ter among&s;t Friends. She laid this concern before Friends, wherewith they concurring, we went on the 5th to Brintwood, the place where they held their meeting. Many friends accompanied us, who I believe were earne&s;tly de&s;irous that we might be rightly conducted among the&s;e dark, crafty &s;pirits; who readily gave us an opportunity with them at their own meeting-hou&s;e. In the forepart of the meeting &s;everal of them &s;poke &s;omething, but at length my companion got liberty, and was favoured with the openings and power of Truth, directly pointed to the confu&s;ed delud|ed &s;tate wherein they were. I was al&s;o exer|ci&s;ed in the like manner, and we had good tidings for &s;ome of them, viz. that there was a way open for them to return, if they would &s;uffer their wills and works to be tried, judged,
<PB N="117" REF="034371_0117_0FFC2E8737A96F78">
and condemned; which I believe a few of them received well; for there appeared to be &s;ome &s;imple-hearted deluded &s;ouls among them; who, being taken with the more than ordinary &s;hew of righteou&s;ne&s;s, and high pre|ten&s;ions to enjoyments, vi&s;ions, and revela|tions; and not having their &s;piritual faculties &s;ufficiently &s;trong to di&s;cern betwixt the reali|ty and the image of Truth; had been inadver|tently catched by them. We had rea&s;on to hope that our labours and &s;ufferings among the&s;e ranting &s;pirits had its &s;ervice; for after we left them, we heard that from that time they had been le&s;s trouble&s;ome to Friends in their meetings.</P>
<P>The 7th, we had meetings at Lynn and Salem. The fir&s;t was large, and greatly mix|ed with people of other &s;ocieties, wherein the Lord was plea&s;ed to favour me in the exer|ci&s;e of my gift: the la&s;t was of Friends &s;elect, and the &s;ervice principally fell upon my com|panion, who&s;e concern chiefly pointed to Friends.</P>
<P>The 8th, we went to Bo&s;ton, and attended the monthly meeting there the &s;ame day, to which came many people of other &s;ocieties, but we were wholly &s;ilent. We &s;taid over the Fir&s;t-day meetings, which were attended by abundance of people not profe&s;&s;ing with us; but neither of us had much to impart to them, which was matter of wonder both to them and to &s;ome who profe&s;&s;ed with us; there being now a willingne&s;s in the people
<PB N="118" REF="034371_0118_0FFC2E85ACC793C8">
of this city, to hear the te&s;timony of Truth. We were engaged to pay a religious vi&s;it to mo&s;t of the families of Friends there, where|in we were favoured with the &s;atisfactory evi|dence of being in the way of our duty; and from which we hoped &s;ome good would en&s;ue, for it &s;eemed to have con&s;iderable effect up|on &s;ome, e&s;pecially of the youth.</P>
<P>The 14th, we went to Mendon, and after having vi&s;ited a few little meetings to the north-we&s;t; we pa&s;&s;ed, through &s;everal, to Rhode I&s;land. We were painfully exerci&s;ed in this quarter, being engaged for the e&s;tab|li&s;hing of a right di&s;cipline; and in the di&s;|couragement of a mini&s;try in words, which was not accompanied with the power of Truth; wherewith &s;ome of the people were amu&s;ed, but not profitably fed, and the truly &s;en&s;ible were di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. In divers places we were mo&s;tly or wholly &s;ilent, in large mixed meet|ings, perhaps for examples to the&s;e forward &s;pirits. It rai&s;ed the di&s;plea&s;ure of &s;ome a|gain&s;t us; but we were mercifully pre&s;erved patient and re&s;igned, and I hope ready to do good for evil.</P>
<P>The 27th, we came to Newport on Rhode I&s;land, and were affectionately received by our friends Thomas and Mary Richard&s;on and their children, with whom we lodged both now and when there before.</P>
<P>The 28th, we were at their week-day meet|ing, which was pretty much mixed with peo|ple of other &s;ocieties; but our concern at
<PB N="119" REF="034371_0119_0FFC2E824E9D39E8">
this time being principally to Friends, their coming rendered it difficult for us to di&s;charge our duties. We therefore reque&s;ted a meet|ing of Friends &s;elect, which we obtained, and I believe it ended to the general &s;atisfaction of the &s;en&s;ible minds pre&s;ent; the Lord's power being exalted therein, under the tendering effects whereof &s;ome of the youth were bow|ed.</P>
<P>From Newport we went through &s;everal meetings on the i&s;land of Ponigan&s;et to Green|wich, wherein I had but little &s;hare in the mini&s;try; but my companion had good &s;er|vice in this quarter. Here we parted from many Friends who had been made near to us in the Truth; and on the 8th of the Ninth month, &s;et our faces towards New York government; but my companion, not finding her &s;pirit relea&s;ed from Greenwich, we returned back the next morning, and had a meeting with Friends there the &s;ame day; and the 10th, had one at Machanticut. We had &s;ome painful labour in both the&s;e meet|ings, the cau&s;e of which I forbear to mention, but in the end had to point out one of the parties that had occa&s;ioned it.</P>
<P>The 11th, we proceeded on our journey through Connecticut Province, to Oblong in New York government, about 150 miles, having no meetings by the way but at New Millford, where there is a few under the pro|fe&s;&s;ion of Truth.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="034371_0120_0FFC2E808F108D58">From thence we went to Sali&s;bury, and the Nine Partners; where my companion was confined by indi&s;po&s;ition, and I was obliged to attend the meetings in this quarter alone; wherein I was favoured with a degree of Divine help.</P>
<P>The 23d, we returned to Oblong, and were at the meetings there on the Fir&s;t-day, which were large, and I hope &s;erviceable.</P>
<P>From hence we had thoughts of pa&s;&s;ing through the other meetings of Friends on the main land in this quarter, and &s;o of proceed|ing to Long I&s;land; but &s;oon after we left Oblong, a cloud came over our &s;pirits; and being dive&s;ted of a capacity for &s;ervice, we concluded to go directly to Long I&s;land, and there to re&s;t until the cau&s;e or end of this di&s;|pen&s;ation &s;hould be manife&s;ted to us; which proved to be a &s;eparation from each other. I had long &s;een it would be &s;o, and &s;ome of our friends before we left Europe expected, and rather pre&s;&s;ed it; fearing that our &s;er|vice would be le&s;s to the church by our keep|ing together, than if we &s;eparated. We had now travelled together as companions in the mo&s;t difficult parts of the country; had &s;hared &s;o many trials, &s;ufferings, and dangers, and had been favoured with great unity of &s;pirit therein, that it appeared hard for us to part; but when we were convinced of the proprie|ty of it, we &s;ubmitted, in hope that it might tend to the benefit of that glorious cau&s;e, for which we left our native land. After patient|ly
<PB N="121" REF="034371_0121_0FFC2E7E5D0D9770">
waiting &s;ome days, my companion's way opened to Philadelphia; but I not being quite clear that the time for my leaving this quarter was fully come, concluded to &s;tay behind her; which &s;he, as well as my&s;elf, being mo&s;t ea&s;y with, we imparted our exerci&s;e to Friends at their monthly meeting, and had their appro|bation in our &s;eparation.</P>
<P>The 3d of the Tenth month, we took an affectionate leave of each other at the hou&s;e of our friend John Bowne of Flu&s;hing; and &s;he, accompanied by &s;ome men friends, pro|ceeded towards Philadelphia. My view was to turn back to the few meetings we had not vi&s;ited on the main land, and J. Bowne's wife being willing to accompany me, we, with two men friends, left her hou&s;e the &s;ame afternoon. We had a pretty broad ferry to cro&s;s, and the tide not &s;erving until evening, it was near night when we got over. We did not go in the &s;ame boat with the hor&s;es, but one of the men friends &s;taid with them, and we could not expect them over for a con&s;ider|able time. The ferry hou&s;e &s;eemed a poor place to lodge at, and it appeared proper we &s;hould that night get to the hou&s;e of a friend, who was member of the meeting I wi&s;hed to attend next day, that notice might be given of it; and if we &s;taid for our hor&s;es the family might probably be gone to bed. We therefore inquired for hor&s;es to proceed forward, but could procure only one, upon which I deter|mined to go with a man to ride before me,
<PB N="122" REF="034371_0122_0FFC2E7C2B16F9B0">
who was to bring the hor&s;e back. My friends who were with me knew the people of the fer|ry, &s;o I &s;et out without fear, although I had no pillion. We had but about two or three miles to ride, and it was a fine, clear, moon|light night, and mo&s;t of the way on an even &s;and. I &s;oon found the hor&s;e was a &s;tumbler (indeed the poor bea&s;t had no &s;hoes on, a common ca&s;e on Long I&s;land, and other even, &s;andy parts of the country), and when we had gone perhaps half way, down he came, and threw us both; but we were thrown far enough from the hor&s;e to receive no hurt from him. The hor&s;e rolled upon his back, and when he aro&s;e I found the &s;addle had no girth to it, and I knew before that it had no crupper, &s;o it was unlikely that its rider &s;hould have any command of him when he fell. We had a kind of a wa&s;h-way to pa&s;s before we got to the friend's hou&s;e, &s;o I could not well walk it; therefore I mounted again at &s;ome high rails, and we reached the hou&s;e before the family was in bed; and my friends came &s;afe the &s;ame night. I vi&s;ited the meetings on the Main, which I had a view of, and returned to Flu&s;h|ing the 5th.</P>
<P>I wi&s;hed to vi&s;it the meetings on Long I&s;land, that I might be excu&s;ed from return|ing back thereto; but not having ea&s;e of mind in the pro&s;pect, I concluded to follow my companion to Philadelphia; in which I believe I was right, as it tended to convince Friends in general that our &s;eparation was not occa&s;ion|ed
<PB N="123" REF="034371_0123_0FFC2E79210FDA18">
by any difference betwixt us, or other im|proper cau&s;e or motive: &s;o I proceeded ac|cordingly, accompanied by one man friend.</P>
<P>On the 7th, we &s;topped to refre&s;h our&s;elves at New York, and my affectionate friend Mar|garet Bowne at who&s;e hou&s;e we had lodged before, concluded to take me in her chai&s;e to Philadelphia: a &s;ea&s;onable relief from riding on hor&s;eback. We cro&s;&s;ed the Sound that af|ternoon, and reached Philadelphia the 10th, a journey of about 100 miles from New York. My companion had gone a little round, in her way from Long I&s;land to vi&s;it a general meet|ing, and came to Philadelphia the &s;ame day; and after having conver&s;ed with each other, we were mutually &s;atisfied with meeting, al|though we could not &s;ee that we &s;hould unite again in the &s;ervice through the provinces of Penn&s;ylvania and the Jer&s;eys.</P>
<P>We &s;taid in Philadelphia more than a week, and our friends were unanimous that it was be&s;t for us to &s;eparate. My way opened to go to the yearly meeting to be held at Shrew&s;|bury. In the way thereto, I fell in with &s;e|veral week-day meetings, and with one ap|pointed by Jo&s;hua Dixon, a friend on a religi|ous vi&s;it from England. I had al&s;o &s;ome &s;er|vice in the families of Friends, for which I had my reward. The meeting at Shrew&s;bury began the 28th, and was attended by divers valuable mini&s;ters; and indeed I thought there was need of weight to counteract the light fro|thy &s;pirit which appeared in the people, both
<PB N="124" REF="034371_0124_0FFC2E77964CB1C8">
in &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters">e of tho&s;e who made profe&s;&s;ion of Truth, as well as many of other &s;ocieties; who&s;e mo|tive in attending that meeting being more to plea&s;e the natural mind, by getting into the company and conver&s;ation of each other, than for the honour of Truth, they added no weight to it. However, the Lord was plea&s;|ed &s;o to favour, that the te&s;timony of Truth was &s;everal times &s;et over them in good au|thority. I was particularly engaged for the welfare of my fellow members in &s;ociety, and de&s;ired an opportunity with the heads of fami|lies; which was procured, and I had good &s;atisfaction in it.</P>
<P>The 30th, I left Shrew&s;bury, and the 1&s;t of the Eleventh month, returned to Philadel|phia, a journey of near 90 miles. I met my com|panion here well and al&s;o my dear friends John Churchman, who was returned from his vi&s;it to Friends in England, and Samuel Forther|gill, who was entering upon one to Friends in America. We were mutually refre&s;hed in beholding the faces one of another, our uni|on in the Truth being &s;trong, which was now renewed in the fre&s;h &s;pringing up of its life. We all attended the quarterly meeting at Philadel|phia, which was large, and eminently crown|ed with the Divine pre&s;ence; wherein my companion and &s;elf rejoiced, though we had but little &s;hare in the public &s;ervice.</P>
<P>As we found it right to part, for the go&s;|pel's &s;ake, on the 8th, we took leave of each other in a degree of cheerfulne&s;s, and in the
<PB N="125" REF="034371_0125_0FFC2E7566E21DE8">
unity of the &s;pirits; committing each other to the Divine protection, under a feeling &s;en&s;e of his humbling goodne&s;s. My views pointed to We&s;t Jer&s;ey, &s;o I cro&s;&s;ed the River Dela|ware at Philadelphia, being accompanied by Sarah Barney, a religious young woman of the I&s;land of Nantucket, who had come to Philadelphia to &s;pend &s;ome time among Friends there, and found freedom to go with me for a while, as I did to except of her company. She was not in the mini&s;try.</P>
<P>I pa&s;&s;ed through a train of meetings to the quarterly meeting at Salem, and my concern principally bending to the members of our own &s;ociety in that quarter, I was plea&s;ed that the meetings, were not mixed with others; and was &s;ometimes favoured with a degree of enlargement in the heavenly gift, though at others poor and low.</P>
<P>The quarterly meeting at Salem began the 16th and ended the 19th, wherein I had clo&s;e hard exerci&s;e in &s;pirit, as well as in mini&s;|terial &s;ervice, in which I was not much enlarg|ed.</P>
<P>The 20th, I had a meeting at Greenwich, where there is a promi&s;ing pro&s;pect among the youth, on &s;everal of whom the &s;olidity of Truth is deeply impre&s;&s;ed. My &s;pirit was clo&s;ely united to them, but could mini&s;ter but little. It appeared to me, that the Almigh|ty would more perfect his work in them, by the immediate operation of his own Spirit, than by the help of in&s;truments.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="034371_0126_0FFC2E7342D8D220">The 21&s;t, we rode between 50 and 60 miles to Cape May, vi&s;ited the few Friends there and &s;o proceeded to Great Egg Har|bour, vi&s;ited the &s;everal meetings there, and the 28th, went to Little Egg Harbour. We went a con&s;iderable way betwixt the&s;e two harbours in a canoe ju&s;t wide enough for one per&s;on to &s;it in: there was ice in the bottom of it, which being broken, &s;ome &s;traw was laid for me to &s;it on.</P>
<P>Hence we proceeded, through Upper Springfield, to New York. In our way we lodged at Amboy, at the hou&s;e of a widow, who was under the profe&s;&s;ion of Truth. Here we met with a young woman, to who&s;e per&s;on and character I was an entire &s;tranger, on who&s;e account I became concerned, &s;u&s;pect|ing that all was not right with her: and in the morning after breakfa&s;t, I &s;poke to her in a very clo&s;e manner, and gave her &s;uch advice, as in the openings of Truth aro&s;e in my heart. I thought I could partly have pointed out her crime, had not delicacy and fear kept me back. She wept much, and ha&s;tily retired in great confu&s;ion and agitation of mind; and I afterwards heard that &s;he had had a child by her &s;i&s;ter's hu&s;band, and was come here to be &s;heltered from publick notice; but the Lord followed her, and I had rea&s;on to hope that the extendings of his grace were towards her, although &s;he had been &s;o great an offen|der. After &s;ome more clo&s;e and very parti|cular &s;ervice with the woman of the hou&s;e, I
<PB N="127" REF="034371_0127_0FFC2E708324E6B0">
left it in peace and thankfulne&s;s to the Almighty, who had enabled me to di&s;charge this hard piece of &s;ervice; for &s;o indeed it was, to &s;peak thus to individuals and &s;trang|ers: but in the day of his power his people are made willing to execute his commands.</P>
<P>I went to Raway and Rywoods meetings, and got to New York the 5th of the Twelfth month; and after a meeting there went on Long I&s;land, where I vi&s;ited all the &s;ettled meetings of Friends, &s;ave one, which I had been at before. My concern here at this time principally bended towards the members of our own &s;ociety; and &s;ometimes when meetings were much mixed with others, I had nothing to &s;ay to them; which gave of|fence, not only to them, but to &s;ome carnal profe&s;&s;ors of Truth; but I endeavoured to re&s;t &s;atisfied in the Divine will, well knowing, In|finite Wi&s;dom knew be&s;t what to admini&s;ter for their good. At Flu&s;hing, the people not pro|fe&s;&s;ing with us, had a great curio&s;ity to hear me preach. Many of them had been with me at two meetings when I was before on the I&s;land at both of which I was &s;ilent, and now came again, and were a third time di&s;appoint|ed, I believe in wi&s;dom; for they being &s;till di&s;&s;atisfied, a number of young people came in the evening to my lodgings, I &s;uppo&s;e with an intent to know whether I had any private meeting in the family, with whom I &s;at down in retirement; and others of the neighbour|hood hearing of it (by means of &s;ome of the
<PB N="128" REF="034371_0128_0FFC2E6ED54DC7F8">
family whom they had de&s;ired to give them intelligence if there were &s;uch an opportunity), came in, and I had a remarkable te&s;timony among&s;t them, directed to their &s;tates; the force of which &s;ome of them could not evade, as the opportunity was &s;o &s;elect. I found after|wards that divers of them were Dei&s;ts, a|gain&s;t who&s;e principles I had to &s;trike with much &s;trength and clearne&s;s. Friends pre|&s;ent were comforted in the feeling of Divine goodne&s;s; for the power of Truth was ex|alted, ble&s;&s;ed for ever be the name of the Lord; who in his own time, will honour &s;uch as honour him by manife&s;ting that they are no|thing, nor can do any thing, but through his Divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>The 18th of the Twelfth month, we left Long I&s;land, in a thankful &s;en&s;e of the pro|vidential care of our heavenly Father, in pre+&s;erving and &s;u&s;taining us through the many dangers and difficulties attendant on this jour|ney in the winter &s;ea&s;on; when the roads in many places were bad, and we had many broad, wild ferries to cro&s;s, which are &s;ome|times rendered very dangerous through the fro&s;t and &s;trong gales of wind; but the wea|ther was always favourable when we cro&s;&s;ed them.</P>
<P>The 19th, I attended a monthly meeting at Woodbridge, which was &s;mall and exerci&s;|ing, wherein I had little &s;ervice, except to &s;trengthen the hands of Friends in the di&s;ci|pline, the line whereof &s;hould have been far|ther
<PB N="129" REF="034371_0129_0FFC2E6C0B1F59E0">
&s;tretched over &s;ome tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors. We re&s;ted a day or two at Raway, at the hou&s;e of our kind friends Jo&s;. and Sarah Shotwell, and the 22d, went to Plainfield, and thence, through &s;everal &s;mall meetings, to a number of meetings about Burlington, which were mo&s;t|ly large, and &s;ome of them &s;atisfactory, be|ing attended by the power of Truth; but the doctrine was mo&s;tly clo&s;e, for which there was &s;orrowfully a cau&s;e. The 13th of the Fir&s;t month, 1755, we cro&s;&s;ed the River Delaware, and were at a meeting at Bri&s;tol, in Bucks County, Penn&s;ylvania; which was not large, but attended with a degree of the Divine pre&s;ence. The 15th, we were at the Falls meeting, in which I was &s;ilent, and which was a comfortable &s;ea&s;on to me. The 16th, I parted from my companion Sarah Barney, who having received a hurt upon her arm by a fall from her hor&s;e, was prevented from ac|companying me further. She was a tender af|fectionate companion, and very exemplary in her conver&s;ation; which together with that &s;incere love to Truth which dwelt in her, uni|ted her to my &s;pirit.</P>
<P>Grace Fi&s;her, a friend in the mini&s;try from Philadelphia, accompanied me through the re&s;t of the meetings in Bucks County, which were five. In &s;ome &s;ea&s;ons of &s;ilence the people appeared to be too generally in a dull, &s;lug|gi&s;h &s;tate. In &s;ome of the&s;e meetings the Al|mighty plea&s;ed to open the &s;pring of the mi|ni&s;try, which I believe flowed in a manner not
<PB N="130" REF="034371_0130_0FFC2E6A7ABB9560">
quite agreeable to &s;ome, who wanted &s;mooth things, although they were not their portion: and may I never mini&s;ter &s;o deceitfully, as to cry Peace, when his holy &s;pirit is grieved. There is in this country a weighty, living num|ber of friends, unto whom my &s;pirit was clo&s;e|ly united in the covenant of life, but there are many dwellers at ea&s;e. Some of the youth appear promi&s;ing, and the Divine vi&s;itation was largely extended to many. Oh! that they may embrace and dwell under it, &s;o as to become partakers of the glorious privileges of the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation.</P>
<P>The 21&s;t, I again cro&s;&s;ed the River Dela|ware, accompanied by Grace Cro&s;dale, a Friend of Bucks County, who had a gift in the mini&s;try, and went to Bethlehem, and thence to vi&s;it a few families about twenty miles back in the woods; with &s;ome of whom we had a meeting which was attended by &s;everal of their neighbours; to whom I was drawn to mini&s;ter freely in the love of the go&s;pel, and believe it had its effect among&s;t them.</P>
<P>The 23d, we again cro&s;&s;ed the River Del|aware, which was pretty full of ice, and our men friends were a little doubtful that if they went over with us they could not return the next day, &s;hould the fro&s;t continue; as the ice might be united, though not &s;trong enough to bear them; and I being unwilling they &s;hould be detained, concluded to go with two men (&s;trangers to me, but one of them known to friends in general) who were waiting for a
<PB N="131" REF="034371_0131_0FFC2E68234B1478">
pa&s;&s;age over the river; they accompanied us to a friend's hou&s;e about five miles on the other &s;ide where the next day we had a &s;mall meeting with a few Dutch people, and then proceeded to the upper part of Philadelphia County and Berks County, in which part the meetings are mo&s;tly &s;mall. I had &s;ome painful labour of &s;pirit in this quarter, and al&s;o a comfortable pro&s;pect; for the Lord has among&s;t Friends here, a remnant of the anci|ent &s;tock, who have, in a good degree, kept their habitations in the Truth; and a few of the youth are brought under its humbling bap|ti&s;m; and I thought the extendings of his Di|vine vi&s;itation were to the carele&s;s.</P>
<P>The 31&s;t, we cro&s;&s;ed the River Schuylkill in a canoe, and our hor&s;es were &s;wum over. We attended a meeting at Nantmill in Che&s;|ter County, the 1&s;t of the Second month; and pa&s;&s;ed through &s;everal meetings to the quarterly meeting for Che&s;ter County, held at Concord.</P>
<P>About this time I was under a very heavy exerci&s;e of &s;pirit, being environed with dark|ne&s;s and made to &s;tand as in the &s;tate of &s;uch as de&s;pi&s;e religion, and call in que&s;tion Divine ju&s;tice and mercy. Under this painful bap|ti&s;m I continued many days, whereby all the ble&s;&s;ings of kind Providence were imbittered, and my life &s;eemed a burthen; yet &s;ometimes a glimp&s;e of light would dart through the cloud, and I conceived a hope of deliverance thereby, and that this di&s;pen&s;ation was allot|ted
<PB N="132" REF="034371_0132_0FFC2E65F36CA858">
renewedly to fit me to mini&s;ter to &s;ome in this &s;tate, as well as to &s;ympathize with the afflicted and tempted. It appeared to me re|markable that although I was thus exerci&s;ed when out of meetings, both by day and by night, and perhaps for a con&s;iderable part of the time I was in them; yet was I not en|tirely di&s;abled for &s;ervice; the cloud would break as in an in&s;tant, and I had ju&s;t light and &s;trength afforded to &s;ee and di&s;charge my duty; and after a while it would clo&s;e up again as before. My &s;oul hath abundant cau&s;e to ble&s;s the name of my God in this and &s;uch like painful &s;ea&s;ons, which I de&s;ire to retain in la&s;ting remembrance; for had it not been for the &s;upport of his powerful mer|ciful hand, I had been as one who goes down into the pit; being as it were entered, in thought, into the dark avenues which lead to de&s;truction; yet faintly (as I thought) ad|hearing to that faith which was once delivered to the &s;aints. The&s;e are the &s;ea&s;ons of the
<Q>trial of our faith, which is more precious than that of gold which peri&s;heth.</Q></P>
<P>The quarterly meeting at Concord began the 7th of the Second month, where I met my dear companion Mary Pei&s;ly. Our meet|ing was attended with Divine con&s;olation, under a &s;en&s;e of the protection of Providence having been over us in our ab&s;ence from each other; and our union in the Truth was re|newed and &s;trengthened. The quarterly meet|ing was large, and Divinely favoured and the
<PB N="133" REF="034371_0133_0FFC2E63D1FF19F8">
te&s;timony of Truth therein exalted in &s;trength and clearne&s;s.</P>
<P>The minds of &s;ome members of our &s;ociety were at this time much un&s;ettled through government affairs. A war with the French &s;eemed likely to break out; and &s;ome were for deviating from our Chri&s;tian te&s;timony, which is again&s;t defen&s;ive, as well as offen|&s;ive war; con&s;i&s;tently with that pure charity which
<Q>beareth all things, and &s;eeketh not its own</Q>
by means contrary to the ten|dency of the peaceable go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation.
Again&s;t this &s;pirit we had to te&s;tify, I hope to good purpo&s;e, for the power of Truth was over the meetings in an eminent degree, whereby the doctrine preached was enforced: glory be to the Lord for ever! He bringeth down and rai&s;eth up, for the honour of his own name, and the e&s;tabli&s;hment of his &s;er|vants in righteou&s;ne&s;s and truth. The &s;crip|ture given me to comment upon in this meet|ing was Joel 2d, ver&s;e the 15th, and &s;ome following, whereon I was opened to my own humbling admiration and that of &s;ome of my friends. Here we met our friends John Churchman, Jo&s;hua Dixon, and many more, with whom our &s;pirits were comforted in the Divine pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>The 12th, we came to Philadelphia, where we &s;pent a few days, and were principally en|gaged in vi&s;iting &s;ome friends' families and the girls' &s;chool for Friends' children. We al&s;o vi&s;ited the pri&s;on, wherein were confined
<PB N="134" REF="034371_0134_0FFC2E6106A62600">
&s;everal who had made &s;ome profe&s;&s;ion of Truth, viz. one for debt, and three boys for theft, who, with the fourth, their accomplice, were much broken in &s;pirit. This was to me one of the mo&s;t affecting &s;ervices I had ever been engaged in, from the con&s;ideration of their deplorable circum&s;tances; for although their lives might be &s;pared, a la&s;ting &s;tain might remain upon their reputation; but we were comforted in the hope of their be|ing brought to repentance, as Divine mercy was extended unto them. Oh! how careful ought young people to be of the com|pany they keep; for if they are familiar with the children of darkne&s;s, they too often, by almo&s;t imperceptible degrees, contract their vicious inclinations, and are led into acts of wicked|ne&s;s, from which they would once, perhaps, have &s;hrunk back with horror.</P>
<P>The 18th, we went in company to Frank|fort, where we had a good meeting, and parted in the comfortable &s;en&s;e of the Divine pre&s;ence; my companion going to &s;ome meet|ings in Bucks County, and my&s;elf to A|bington, Hor&s;ham, and Plymouth, accompani|ed by Sarah Morris of Philadelphia, and An|na Logan.</P>
<P>The 22d, I again met my companion at Burlington, where we attended the quarterly meeting for the upper part of We&s;t Jer&s;ey; which was a &s;olemn &s;ea&s;on, and the &s;pring of the mini&s;try was opened to edification and comfort.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="034371_0135_0FFC2E5EADE511B8">The 26th and 27th, we attended the quar|terly meeting in Bucks county, Penn&s;ylvania; which was large and &s;atisfactory, Divine help being extended to the encouragement of us and of the faithful pre&s;ent. Here my com|panion and I again &s;eparated in a &s;en&s;e of our heavenly Father's love; and my&s;elf with Sarah Morris proceeded to vi&s;it &s;ome meetings in Bucks and Philadelphia Counties, and came to Philadelphia the 8th of the Third month. I &s;taid in and about the city till the 24th, vi&s;iting &s;ome of the families of friends, as my &s;trength which was but low, would permit; but I had &s;olid peace in &s;pending a few days in this &s;ervice.</P>
<P>On the 24th, I went to Newtown in We&s;t Jer&s;ey, &s;o to Eve&s;ham and Haddonfield to the quarterly meeting for that province; where|in I was low both in body and mind, and had <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word"> much publick &s;ervice.</P>
<P>The 28th, the half-year's meeting at Phi|ladelphia began. Here I again met my dear companion Mary Pei&s;ley. The meeting was large and &s;olemn, there was much &s;ilence in it, which was perhaps not le&s;s profitable to many, though le&s;s plea&s;ing, than preaching.</P>
<P>The 3d of the Fourth month we again &s;epa|rated, and I went towards the ea&s;tern &s;hore of Maryland, having for a companion Han|nah Fo&s;ter of We&s;t Jer&s;ey, al&s;o Jo&s;hua Fi&s;her of Philadelphia, who went to a&s;&s;i&s;t us, it be|ing a quarter wherein it might have been difficult always to procure guides. We were
<PB N="136" REF="034371_0136_0FFC2E5D1E617B28">
obliged to travel hard, and I having al&s;o hard &s;ervice among&s;t a few unfaithful profe&s;|&s;ors of Truth who were &s;cattered about in this quarter, and my health being poor, it was painful for me to pur&s;ue the journey; but Divine goodne&s;s &s;ecretly &s;u&s;tained my &s;oul, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted to di&s;charge my duty according to knowledge; and in the end afforded a comfortable hope that my labour was not en|tirely fruitle&s;s. We attended a half-year's meeting at Che&s;ter in Maryland, and another at Duck Creek: at the la&s;t we met John Churchman. We had labourious travail of &s;pirit, the life of Truth being low in that quarter, but through Infinite goodne&s;s, the te&s;timony of it was rai&s;ed in a good degree of authority. We had comfortable hope re|&s;pecting &s;ome young people hereaway, and part|ed from the living among&s;t them under a &s;en&s;e of Divine favour. We proceeded through &s;everal &s;mall meetings of Friends (wherein I had painful labour of &s;pirit, yet I hope &s;ome &s;olid &s;ervice) to Lewi&s;ton. There is no meeting of Friends e&s;tabli&s;hed here, but we had a large one in the court-hou&s;e, wherein the power and te&s;timony of Truth was rai&s;ed in domini|on to the prai&s;e of the great Name.</P>
<P>The 29th, we returned to Duck Creek, my&s;elf in a very low &s;tate both of body and mind; but as I endeavoured to keep my mind to the Lord, he was plea&s;ed as in an in&s;tant to di&s;pel the thick cloud of darkne&s;s which for &s;ome days had encompa&s;&s;ed me;
<PB N="137" REF="034371_0137_0FFC2E5AE5593010">
and &s;o to lift up the light of his countenance upon me, that I rejoiced exceedingly in the hope of his &s;alvation.</P>
<P>The 4th of the Fifth month my compani|on Hannah Fo&s;ter left me at Ea&s;t Nottingham, and my valuable friend Margaret Churchman (wife of John Churchman) accompanied me to &s;ome meetings in Lanca&s;ter and York Coun|ties; and &s;o to the yearly meeting held at We&s;t River, for the we&s;tern &s;hore of Mary|land, at which I had been with my companion M. Pei&s;ley, in 1754, but had then but little public &s;ervice among&s;t the people. I met with &s;ome oppo&s;ition in my endeavours for the revival of di&s;cipline, from apo&s;tate and libertine &s;pirits; but the Lord &s;upported me above it.</P>
<P>The yearly meeting was large, and Divine|ly favoured. Several friends came over the bay to it, and I was favoured to &s;ee a little fruit of my painful labour when on the other &s;ide, by the change which was apparently wrought in a young per&s;on, who was then of a light conver&s;ation. William Brown, from Philadelphia, attended this meeting, and had good &s;ervice therein. Love &s;eemed to &s;pread among&s;t Friends at this time, and we left them in peace, and returned the 26th to Ea&s;t Not|tingham; where I met Sarah Morris, from Philadelphia, who propo&s;ed to accompany me through Che&s;ter and Lanca&s;ter Counties, &amp;c. She was a truly exemplary woman, and &s;ome|times highly favoured in the mini&s;try.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="034371_0138_0FFC2E5895479DD8">We left Nottingham the 29th, and pa&s;&s;ed through the re&s;t of the meetings in Lanca&s;ter County, wherein I had much clo&s;e &s;ervice. We vi&s;ited Che&s;ter County pretty thoroughly, wherein is a very large body of profe&s;&s;ors of Truth, but many of them are deficient in regard to its &s;anctifying operation upon the &s;pirit. Many noble pillars have been removed from among&s;t them, and &s;ome of the elders who then remained had unhappily lo&s;t their &s;tations in the Truth, and yet nominally re|tained their offices in the church. The&s;e were &s;tumbling blocks to the youth, who were too apt to look at the example of &s;uch, and to plead their incon&s;i&s;tent practices as an excu&s;e for their own taking liberties in other re&s;pects. Again&s;t the&s;e, and &s;uch like deceitful watchers and pretended labourers, who had not kept the vineyard of their own hearts, and yet dared to &s;tretch forth their hands to the Lord's &s;ervice, I had &s;harply to te&s;tify: and I &s;ome|times was made an example of &s;ilence in the &s;olemn a&s;&s;emblies. There was al&s;o in this county a &s;olid living number of friends, who were preachers of righteou&s;ne&s;s in their re&s;pec|tive &s;tations, both by example and precept; with who&s;e unity the Lord was plea&s;ed to fa|vour me, and who I tru&s;t will ever be near to my life in that holy bond, which neither time nor death can di&s;&s;olve.</P>
<P>After vi&s;iting Che&s;ter County, I became much indi&s;po&s;ed, and retired to the hou&s;e of my kind friend John Morris, in Philadelphia
<PB N="139" REF="034371_0139_0FFC2E55C485A760">
County; where (as at &s;everal time before had been the ca&s;e) I was affectionately received, and the nece&s;&s;ary endeavours were u&s;ed for my recovery; which the Lord was plea&s;ed &s;o to ble&s;s, that I was enabled in about two weeks, to pur&s;ue my journey, though in con&s;iderable weakne&s;s of body. In this &s;ea&s;on of confine|ment and relea&s;e from public labour, the good phy&s;ician &s;o favoured, that although my body &s;u&s;tained con&s;iderable pain and weakne&s;s, my mind rather gathered &s;trength, and was great|ly encouraged in the hope of future pre&s;erva|tion. My dear companion M. Pei&s;ley came to me from Philadelphia, who having vi&s;ited al|mo&s;t all the meetings of Friends on the conti|nent of America, entertained hope of our &s;oon embarking for our native lands; but we had much more both to do and to &s;uffer, be|fore that hour came. We met in wonted affection, and therein again parted the 2d of the Seventh month; when I proceeded to vi&s;it &s;ome meetings in Philadelphia and Berks County, where there &s;eemed a promi&s;ing pro&s;|pect among&s;t the youth, &s;ome of whom appear|ed to be advancing in rectitude of &s;pirit and conduct at which my &s;oul rejoiced; it being part of the fruits of that labour of love, the Lord of the harve&s;t had cau&s;ed us to be&s;tow upon them. I had con&s;iderable freedom in the exerci&s;e of my gift in this renewed vi&s;it to the&s;e places, and again met my companion the 16th, at Stenton near Philadelphia; from which place we went in company to Philadel|phia
<PB N="140" REF="034371_0140_0FFC2E53F20CCE20">
the 17th, and thence to the quarterly meeting at Concord, in Che&s;ter County; af|ter which I proceeded to &s;ome other meetings in that county, and returned to my compani|on at Philadelphia the 19th of the Eighth month.</P>
<P>From this time we were mo&s;tly together while in the country, which was much longer than was agreeable to our natural inclinations; for we were detained the winter; being en|gaged in vi&s;iting the families of Friends in Philadelphia, in conjunction with the Friends who were under appointment for that &s;ervice; in which important work, we were frequent|ly favoured by the Wi&s;e Head of the church, who directs, that even
<Q>Jeru&s;alem &s;hall be &s;earched with lighted candles;</Q>
and for that purpo&s;e illuminates the &s;pirits of his &s;er|vants, and furni&s;hes with doctrine &s;uited to the &s;tates of tho&s;e vi&s;ited. We took divers turns in the country, to vi&s;it quarterly, month|ly, and particular meetings, and had good &s;ervice for the Lord therein; but in the meet|ings in Philadelphia were frequently bound in &s;pirit, being made to preach &s;ilence by exam|ple; which I believe had its u&s;e, by in&s;tructing the people not to depend on in&s;trumental mini&s;try.</P>
<P>Towards the latter end of the winter, my dear companion became very much indi&s;po&s;ed, and continued &s;o for &s;everal months; in which time &s;he was frequently prevented from attend|ing meetings, and &s;ometimes confined to her

I gave her the &s;tricte&s;t attendance I was capable, in&s;omuch that with other exerci&s;es attending, my health was greatly affected, and my &s;pirits &s;unk to a degree of dejection I had never before known: neverthele&s;s I was &s;o favoured as to be alive, and to be at times &s;trong, in my mini&s;terial &s;ervice, to the very conclu&s;ion of our &s;tay in the country.</P>
<P>And now, as it was our lots in the wi&s;e direction of Providence, to be in the providence of Penn&s;ylvania, at a time when the minds of Friends were more than commonly exerci&s;ed, on account of publick or political affairs; by rea&s;on of the French making incroachments on &s;ome of the Briti&s;h colonies; and &s;ome of the Indian tribes having committed great outrages on their frontiers, and murdered many of the back inhabitants; the conduct of us who were concerned to labour for the &s;upport of our peaceable Chri&s;tian te&s;timony, was har&s;h|ly cen&s;ured by the unthinking multitude; and by &s;uch of our own &s;ociety as were one with them in &s;pirit; who in&s;inuated that we intrud|ed into matters foreign to our proper bu&s;ine&s;s, and were in part the cau&s;e of the continuation of the calamities which attended the provinces, through our te&s;tifying again&s;t the &s;pirit of war, and advi&s;ing Friends to &s;upport our Chri&s;tian te&s;timony faithfully, I think it not improper briefly to give &s;ome account of the &s;hare I had in concerns of this nature.</P>
<P>On my coming to Philadelphia in the Third month, 1755, I under&s;tood the a&s;&s;embly was
<PB N="142" REF="034371_0142_0FFC2E4EEFE882D8">
about to &s;it; and the major part of its members being then under the profe&s;&s;ion of Truth, on con&s;idering how difficult it would be for &s;uch, to maintain our Chri&s;tian te&s;timony, and to act con&s;i&s;tently with what the people at large thought was for the good of the province; I was induced to propo&s;e, a few weighty friends having a religious opportunity with &s;uch mem|bers of the a&s;&s;embly, as made profe&s;&s;ion with us; wherein, perhaps, Truth might open coun&s;els &s;uitable to the occa&s;ion, and our &s;ym|pathy with &s;uch as were concerned to main|tain its te&s;timony might be manife&s;ted.</P>
<P>This meeting with the concurrence of Friends, &s;uch an opportunity was obtained, and I had the privilege of being at it; and therein was concerned to te&s;tify again&s;t that &s;pirit, which from human con&s;iderations was for war, and to &s;trengthen the minds of Friends again&s;t leaning thereto. Divers times during tho&s;e troubles, I was concerned publickly to a&s;&s;ert the con&s;i&s;tency of our peaceable princi|ple with the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation; and once, if not oftener, to point out the con&s;equence of Friends deviating therefrom, which was re|markably fulfilled before I left the country. This was no more than con&s;i&s;tent with my office as a mini&s;ter, and my commi&s;&s;ion to that country, which was to preach Truth and Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;trengthen the hands of my brethren, again&s;t their oppo&s;ers. Both my&s;elf and companion were &s;o clear of im|properly intermeddling with the affairs of
<PB N="143" REF="034371_0143_0FFC2E4CC13F4660">
government, that we &s;ometimes checked the torrent of conver&s;ation on that &s;ubject, either by &s;ilent or verbal reproof; and but &s;eldom &s;o much as read their new&s;papers.</P>
<P>During the time of the people's being in &s;o great confu&s;ion and di&s;tre&s;s, on account of the Indian war, my mind was much exerci&s;ed; but for &s;everal months, I know not that I could at all, even &s;ecretly, petition the Almighty for their relief, with any evidence of &s;uch a petition ari&s;ing from the &s;pring of Divine life. But a little before a &s;top was put to their de|predations, my &s;pirit was almo&s;t continually clothed with interce&s;&s;ion, that the Lord might be plea&s;ed to &s;tay the &s;word; and in two pub|lick meetings I was concerned in like manner; and I did not hear that any mi&s;chief was done after that time, by any Indians who had occa|&s;ioned that di&s;turbance, and a ce&s;&s;ation of arms en&s;ued. I record this as an in&s;tance of Divine wi&s;dom in&s;tructing his &s;ervants to a&s;k what it is plea&s;ing to him to grant; as well as re&s;train|ing them from petitioning for what might be exceeding de&s;irable to them&s;elves, before the proper time; and I believe that if mini&s;ters thus kept under the government of that &s;pirit of wi&s;dom, which giveth liberty in the appoint|ed &s;ea&s;on acceptably to approach the throne of divine Grace, it would be more &s;elf-evident that they a&s;ked in the name and &s;pirit of Je&s;us, by their prayer being an&s;wered.</P>
<P>I think it worth remarking, that the ter|mination of this Indian war, was at la&s;t effect|ed
<PB N="144" REF="034371_0144_0FFC2E4B2FF33908">
by the peaceable interpo&s;ition of Friends. An Indian chief, with other Indians in friend|&s;hip with Penn&s;ylvania, being occa&s;ionally in Philadelphia, Friends obtained leave of the governor to have a conference with them; in order to endeavour, through their interference to bring about an accommodation with the Indians now at war with the Bri|ti&s;h colonies. As we were admitted to attend this conference, I mention it. It evin|ces the veneration the Indians retained for the memory of William Penn, and for his pacific principles; and their great regard to Friends, whom they &s;tiled his children. Several of their women &s;at in this conference, who, for fix|ed &s;olidity, appeared to me like Roman ma|trons. They &s;carcely moved, much le&s;s &s;poke, during the time it was held; and there was a dignity in the behavour and countenance of one of them, that I cannot forget. I was in|formed that they admit their mo&s;t re&s;pected women into their coun&s;els.</P>
<P>And here I remark, that we were in Phila|delphia at the time when the fir&s;t &s;oldiers that had come there commi&s;&s;ioned from the Engli&s;h government, arrived at that city; under the command of General Braddock. I &s;aid a cloud of darkne&s;s came with them. The Lord had &s;ettled this colony by peacea|ble means, he had hitherto protected it by his own Almighty arm and it pro&s;pered greatly; but henceforward di&s;union and di&s;|turbance prevailed and increa&s;ed in it. Our

friend Samuel Fothergill, as well as we, was &s;trongly and affectionately engaged to promote peace, and guard them again&s;t the event, which he feared would en&s;ue, and which in time followed.</P>
<P>Our &s;tay in this country was con&s;iderably longer than u&s;ual for friends who vi&s;it it from Europe; which was much in the cro&s;s to our natural inclination, but quite in the unity of the &s;en&s;ible body of Friends; who &s;aw that we were indu&s;triou&s;ly engaged in the &s;ervice to which Truth had called us: and whatever &s;ome loo&s;e &s;pirits might &s;ugge&s;t re&s;pecting our long ab&s;ence from home, I have this te&s;timo|ny in my con&s;cience, that &s;ince I have been engaged in the &s;olemn &s;ervice of the mini&s;try, I have ever endeavoured to accompli&s;h the duties a&s;&s;igned me, in as &s;hort time as I could; being de&s;irous that I might not afford occa|&s;ion of cen&s;ure to &s;uch, as being unacquaint|ed with the humbling weight of this &s;ervice, may conclude that we travel for plea&s;ure, or to gratify a roving or curious di&s;po&s;ition; as well as that I might &s;pend the &s;pare time af|forded me in the exerci&s;e of my duty in my own family; and examining the &s;tate of my mind; which, after returning from journies of this kind, as well as in going along, &s;hould be nece&s;&s;arily attended to: and may I never be a &s;ervant whom Divine wi&s;dom has made a keeper of his vineyard, but who neglects the culture of his own heart.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="034371_0146_0FFC2E462F5A5080">My companion's &s;ervice through the conti|nent principally bended towards Friends, yet was &s;he at times clearly and livingly opened to others; but my concern was mo&s;tly more general; although in the provinces of Penn|&s;ylvania and the Jer&s;eys, wherein our Chri&s;ti|an principles were pretty much known, it was more particularly directed to my fellow mem|bers in &s;ociety; who had perhaps been the le&s;s laboured with by mini&s;ters vi&s;iting them, on account of meetings often being much mixed with other profe&s;&s;ors. As we &s;pent &s;o much time in Philadelphia before we left the continent, I had many times been much en|larged in the &s;ervice appointed me, both to Friends and others; and my companion, whom as a mini&s;ter I preferred to my&s;elf, had extraordinary &s;ervice; but as is before hinted, her bodily weakne&s;s prevented her attending meetings &s;ome of the latter part of the time we &s;pent in it. I may &s;ay without boa&s;ting, that we were endeared to the weighty body of Friends in that city, as well as in the other parts of the continent, and they were &s;o to us. And after having laboured among them more than two years and &s;even months, we took a &s;olemn leave in the love of the go&s;pel, of tho&s;e pre&s;ent in a large quarterly meeting held at Phialadelphia, and left the city on the 5th of the Sixth month, 1756.

for Dublin, in company with our dear friend Samuel Fothergill, who was returning from his religious vi&s;it to Friends in America, and Abraham Farrington, who was going on one to Friends in Europe.</P>
<P>There were pa&s;&s;engers in the &s;ame ve&s;&s;el with us, Samuel Emlen, a friend of Philadel|phia, and two other young men friends, who were going to England by way of Ireland. We had a very quick but &s;tormy pa&s;&s;age; being on board only thirty-four days, and but twenty-&s;ix of them out of &s;ight of land. The &s;ailors accounted it a very fine pa&s;&s;age, but we &s;uffered very much in it, through the boi&s;terous winds, and their con&s;equences. The wind being right aft, the water frequently da&s;hed over into our cabin, although our <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Boards put to defend the cabin-windows in &s;torms.</NOTE> dead-lights were mo&s;tly kept up; and it run much under my bed, &s;o as to render my lodging very uncomfortable; and, being &s;ea|&s;ick and otherwi&s;e indi&s;po&s;ed, I was at times &s;unk very low, yet the hand of the Lord was near to &s;u&s;tain and comfort me. Notwith&s;tand|ing the &s;tormy weather, we had &s;everal ble&s;&s;ed meetings on the voyage, at &s;ome of which the ma&s;ter and &s;ailors were pre&s;ent, unto whom Divine goodne&s;s was plea&s;ed to open &s;uitable in&s;truction. England was now at war with France, and by the account of &s;ome fi&s;hermen who came on board us in the Iri&s;h Chan|nel, we narrowly e&s;caped being taken pri&s;on|ers,
<PB N="148" REF="034371_0148_0FFC2E42561C9560">
as two privateers were &s;een in the Chan|nel, at the very time we &s;hould probably have met them, had we not for &s;ome hours been forced back by a &s;trong contrary wind, the only one we had during the voyage, which appeared &s;ignally providential for us.</P>
<P>We lodged in Dublin at the hou&s;e of our friend Samuel Judd (who was uncle to my companion), which was formerly the habita|tion of my very worthy aunt, Sarah Baker, who&s;e &s;ervices in the mini&s;try, when re&s;ident in this city, had endeared her to Friends, and her name was precious to tho&s;e of the pre|&s;ent day.</P>
<P>The 10th of the Seventh month, we land|ed at Dublin; and the 25th after taking an affectionate leave of my dear companion and friends, Samuel Fothergill and I took &s;hip|ping for England, and landed at Holyhead in Wales the 27th. Here we bought hor&s;es, and reached Che&s;ter the 29th, where my friend Samuel Fothergill left me, and whence, ac|companied by a young man, a friend, I got home the 31&s;t. I was affectionately received by my dear mother, brother and &s;i&s;ter, who united in thankful acknowledgments of the Lord's mercy, in re&s;toring me to them and my native land. I travelled 155 miles from Holyhead in four days; and had been ab&s;ent from my mother's hou&s;e three years, and up|wards of one month.</P>

<P>THROUGH my late long and great bodily fatigues, my con&s;titution was &s;o &s;haken, that a &s;ea&s;on of re&s;t appeared de&s;ira|ble, and I rather expected it &s;ome time before I returned home; but the Lord was plea&s;ed to order it otherwi&s;e, I hope to his own ho|nour and my pre&s;ervation: for before and quickly after my arrival in England, divers pro&s;pects of duty opened, which appeared likely to engage me for more than a year; and which I was favoured to accompli&s;h in the fol|lowing order.</P>
<P>In about two weeks after my return, I at|tended our quarterly meeting, where I was met by many of my dear friends, who re|joiced to &s;ee me, and we were mea&s;urably fa|voured together in the Divine pre&s;ence. Quickly after this I went to the circular yearly meeting for the &s;even we&s;tern counties, which was held this year at Warwick: it was large, and attended with holy &s;olemnity. My dear friend Samuel Fothergill and my&s;elf had the principal &s;hare in the publick &s;ervice, wherein the Lord favoured us; to whom be the prai&s;e of all his works now and for ever.

This being the u&s;ual time of harve&s;t, with a pro&s;pect of the plentiful crops of grain being much injured by the heavy rains, Samuel Fo|thergill in one of his te&s;timonies noted it, as a threatened judgment from Him who openeth the flood-gates of heaven or &s;tayeth them, to the effecting of his own righteous purpo&s;es. The rains continuing long, &s;o much grain was &s;poiled or damaged, as to occa&s;ion an extreme &s;carcity before the next harve&s;t.</P>
<P>A few weeks after my return from this meeting, I went into Hereford&s;hire, to vi&s;it my &s;i&s;ter Young and her family. I there found my mind engaged to vi&s;it the meetings of Friends in that county, which I did, except one of them, and returned home by way of Worce&s;ter. Here it appeared right for me to get an opportunity with &s;ome of the mo&s;t ex|perienced friends of that city; that we might together con&s;ider about &s;etting forward the good work of vi&s;iting the families of Friends in this county: of which I had a view before I reached home from Ireland; and when I came there, I found that a general vi&s;it to Friends' families throughout the nation had been recommended by the la&s;t yearly meeting at London. I therefore found freedom to offer my&s;elf to a&s;&s;i&s;t in that &s;ervice, provided the &s;ame could be accompli&s;hed &s;o as not to inter|fere with my other pro&s;pects of duty. I al&s;o recommended to the friends pre&s;ent, the e&s;tab|li&s;hment of a meeting for mini&s;ters and elders in the quarterly meeting for this county. We
<PB N="152" REF="034371_0152_0FFC2E3957615230">
were eminently favoured in this opportunity, and I left the city in peace, and with a hope of &s;ome conclu&s;ion being come to at our next quarterly meeting.</P>
<P>I &s;taid at home a few weeks, being clo&s;ely engaged in writing. The 22d of the Eleventh month, I went to Worce&s;ter to attend our quarterly meeting, under a weighty exerci&s;e of &s;pirit, having an intention, if Friends &s;hould accede to the afore&s;aid propo&s;ition of vi&s;iting families, to &s;tay and join them therein. Our quarterly meeting was attended, in a good de|gree, with the Divine pre&s;ence, yet the &s;er|vice of it was hard and laborious. Friends were backward in regard to giving in their names to enter upon the vi&s;it to families, con|cluding them&s;elves unfit for &s;o weighty a work; however &s;ome were nominated, with whom I united, and concluded to &s;tay, and &s;ee how Providence might favour the undertaking. I had &s;ome &s;truggle betwixt affection to my na|tural parent, and the pur&s;uit of the &s;ervice be|fore me; my dear and aged mother being like|ly to be left without either of her daughters; my &s;i&s;ter Ann being with my &s;i&s;ter Young, who&s;e children had the &s;mall-pox; but I was enabled to pur&s;ue my duty, and to commit her to the care of gracious Providence; who&s;e regard I found by account from her&s;elf, &s;he &s;ignally experienced in my ab&s;ence, and en|couraged me to continue in the &s;ervice. I began in great &s;elf-diffidence, and went through the families of Friends in the city;
<PB N="153" REF="034371_0153_0FFC2E3728F91ED8">
but the Lord was with me, and frequently clothed me with &s;trength and wi&s;dom &s;uited to the occa&s;ion. I was con&s;iderably favoured whil&s;t in the city in the exerci&s;e of my gift in the publick meetings of Friends, took leave of them in much love, and left it in peace and thankfulne&s;s.</P>
<P>The 19th of the Twelfth month, being ac|companied by Mary Oldbury, a young wo|man of Worce&s;ter, who had an acceptable gift in the mini&s;try, I went to Per&s;hore, a town wherein no member of our &s;ociety re&s;ided; but Friends, having a meeting-hou&s;e there, held a meeting quarterly, which was this day&punc; It was large, but mo&s;tly compo&s;ed of people of other &s;ocieties. I &s;at about an hour and an half &s;ilent, in which &s;ea&s;on my &s;pirit was &s;weetly compo&s;ed, and re&s;igned to wait the Lord's time to be put forth in &s;ervice; where|in I was afterwards much favoured, the te&s;timo|ny of Truth being exalted in its own authority. The people were very &s;olid and attentive, and I left the town in peace, accompanied by the before-mentioned friend Mary Oldbury, to vi&s;it the families of Friends in Eve&s;ham and Ship&s;ton, which we were favoured to accom|pli&s;h to a good degree of &s;atisfaction. We &s;at with Friends in a few of the meetings in Warwick&s;hire, and &s;o came to my own month|ly meeting of Chadwick, having vi&s;ited almo&s;t all the families of Friends in the &s;everal towns which con&s;titute it, which were four. I re|turned home in peace and thankfulne&s;s for
<PB N="154" REF="034371_0154_0FFC2E35041833D8">
the gracious a&s;&s;i&s;tance vouch&s;afed by Divine goodne&s;s, through this laborious &s;ervice, the 24th of the Fir&s;t month 1757.</P>
<P>I &s;taid about home until the latter end of the Third month, in which interval I was clo&s;ely engaged in attending to &s;ervices as they opened in that quarter, and preparing for tho&s;e di&s;tant ones, which had been impre&s;&s;ed upon my mind to be executed this &s;ummer; viz. the attending the yearly meeting for the four northern counties, and from that to the national meeting at Dublin; &s;o to the yearly meeting at London, and the &s;ucceeding quar|terly meetings in E&s;&s;ex, Suffolk, and Norfolk; which are &s;tiled yearly meetings, becau&s;e at that quarter in the year, there are &s;ome ad|ditional meetings for wor&s;hip held, which are generally large both of Friends and others; and after the&s;e meetings to vi&s;it the few friends remaining in Holland.</P>
<P>My dear friend Lucy Bradley, being en|gaged to vi&s;it Friends in Ireland, concluded to accompany me to Dublin. I met her at Stourbridge on the 23d of the Third month, and left her there for a few days with her re|lations, with an expectation that &s;he would meet me the 27th. I took an affectionate leave of my dear mother and brother, and went, accompanied by my &s;i&s;ter Ann to Wed|ne&s;bury; a town at which a meeting was held quarterly, which happened to be on that day. Here I expected Lucy Bradley to meet me, and that we &s;hould from thence have pur&s;ued
<PB N="155" REF="034371_0155_0FFC2E322FBD63C8">
our journey together, but, being prevented from coming, through indi&s;po&s;ition, &s;he in|formed me that &s;he hoped to be able to meet me in a few days. The meeting was large both of Friends and others, and divinely fa|voured; and after it I took leave of my &s;i&s;ter and divers friends, and went that night to Rugeley in Stafford&s;hire, and as I had for &s;ome time had a view of vi&s;iting the fa|milies of Friends in that county, who are not numerous, I entered upon that &s;ervice the 28th, and vi&s;ited &s;uch as were in that place with &s;ome &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>The 29th, I went to Stafford, at which place the quarterly meeting for the county was that day held, and I laid before Friends my concern for vi&s;iting the families, and had their concurrence therewith.</P>
<P>Here I met with my friend Samuel Emlen, who came pa&s;&s;enger with me in the &s;ame &s;hip from America to Ireland; in which nation he had travelled as companion to his aged coun|tryman Abraham Farrington, and had him|&s;elf appeared in the mini&s;try in that nation, to the &s;atisfaction of Friends. As he was in a weak, low &s;tate of mind, I was inclined to take him with me for a few days. Accord|ingly we left Stafford in company, and, hav|ing vi&s;ited &s;everal Friends' families in the country, went to Uttoxeter; where we pro|ceeded in the &s;ame &s;ervice. My companion Lucy Bradley came to me here, to our mu|tual comfort. We were favoured together
<PB N="156" REF="034371_0156_0FFC2E30A5E53BA0">
with a ble&s;&s;ed opportunity in the friend's fa|mily where we lodged; and after committing each other to the protection of Providence, we parted from Samuel Emlen and went to Leek; where we al&s;o vi&s;ited the families of Friends, which we were favoured to fini&s;h the 8th of the Fourth month, I hope to the mutual &s;atisfaction of our&s;elves, and of the friends of the county who accompanied us in that &s;ervice.</P>
<P>During my engagement in this weighty work, I was &s;urpri&s;ed with the intelligence that my endeared friend and companion Mary Pei&s;ley was removed from mutability. She had been married but three days to Samuel Neale, a Friend of Ireland, and went off with a few hours indi&s;po&s;ition; being doubtle&s;s removed from the pro&s;pect of a &s;ettlement on earth, to a glorious eternal inheritance; for which &s;he appeared more vi&s;ibly prepared than many others of the Lord's &s;ervants. We had been companions together in many probations, and our union in the Truth was &s;trong, &s;o that her death affected me deeply, the more &s;o from being attended with &s;o &s;ingular a circum|&s;tance; yet was my &s;pirit thankful that &s;he was taken at an hour when her crown &s;hone brightly. She had been a great example to me in divers re&s;pects, and I begged to be a&s;&s;i&s;ted to follow her, as &s;he had followed Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>The 9th we went to Warrington, where a renewed occa&s;ion of thankfulne&s;s to gracious
<PB N="157" REF="034371_0157_0FFC2E2D4EF58F30">
Providence was admini&s;tered, by the probabi|lity of the recovery of our dear friend Samu|el Fothergill, from an indi&s;po&s;ition wherein his life had been de&s;paired of. This had much affected my mind, from the con&s;ideration of the great lo&s;s the church would &s;u&s;tain by his removal, and my&s;elf as an individual member thereof; yet dur&s;t I not a&s;k his longer conti|nuance in this &s;tate of trials and dangers, knowing that if Divine wi&s;dom called him out of it now, it would certainly be in the be&s;t time.</P>
<P>From Warrington we went, through divers meetings in Lanca&s;hire, to the quarterly meet|ing at Lanca&s;ter, which was &s;ignally favoured with the manife&s;tation of Divine regard thro' the mini&s;try. I remember, before the publick meeting, I was &s;unk &s;o low, that I &s;carcely ex|pected ever more to be &s;et at liberty in the ex|erci&s;e of my gift as heretofore; yet could not &s;ee what I had done to occa&s;ion a lo&s;s therein; but in the meeting I was as remarkably rai&s;ed. Thus are the poor in&s;truments aba&s;ed and ho|noured for their own pre&s;ervation, and the good of the church; the one di&s;pen&s;ation be|ing as a balla&s;t for the other.</P>
<P>The 26th, we went, in company with &s;eve|ral friends, towards Penrith, where the year|ly meeting for the four northern counties was to be held. In our way we called upon that truly honourable mother in I&s;rael, Grace Chambers, who was very ancient and had been long indi&s;po&s;ed, with whom we were

favoured with a refre&s;hing opportunity. How encouraging is it to young travellers to behold and con&s;ider &s;uch examples of per&s;everance! It baffles the efforts of the adver&s;ary to per|&s;uade that it is impo&s;&s;ible to hold out to the end; and rai&s;es this language in the &s;oul, Lord, let my life and latter end be like theirs. At Penrith we met my beloved friend Abra|ham Farrington, another of the&s;e ancient worthies, and we mutually rejoiced to &s;ee each other.</P>
<P>The yearly meeting was large both of Friends and people of other &s;ocieties. My &s;pirit was bowed before the Almighty, that I might be pre&s;erved acting in my proper place in the cour&s;e of my &s;ervice therein, and that my conduct might be unblamable; and, through mercy, I had humbling cau&s;e of thank|fulne&s;s admini&s;tered in the clo&s;e thereof, to Him who had exalted his own name and te&s;|timony through &s;o weak an in&s;trument, unto whom be the prai&s;e now and for ever, &s;aith my &s;oul! Although this meeting was attended by &s;everal able mini&s;ters of the male &s;ex, it plea&s;ed the wi&s;e Ma&s;ter of the &s;olemnity to employ them but little, and to lay the weight of the &s;ervice upon the females; who, though the weaker ve&s;&s;els by nature, are at times ren|dered &s;trong through his Divine power: and our brethren rejoiced that it was apparently &s;o, through the cour&s;e of the&s;e meetings.</P>
<P>The exerci&s;e of my mind while at Penrith, was added to by the pro&s;pect of my concern
<PB N="159" REF="034371_0159_0FFC2E298B845D40">
for vi&s;iting &s;ome parts of Holland; for al|though before I left home I was re&s;igned thereto, and had imparted it to my relations, as well as to Friends of the monthly meeting, that they might con&s;ider re&s;pecting granting me a certificate; yet now on its near ap|proach, my want of the language, the va|rious notions in religion which I knew pre|vailed among&s;t that people, my &s;ex, and, for ought I knew, the being expo&s;ed to much hard&s;hip, revolved in my mind; and, being oppo&s;ed to my little &s;trength, depre&s;&s;ed my &s;pirits, yet not &s;o as to cau&s;e me to turn from the pro&s;pect, or prevent my wre&s;tling with the Almighty for wi&s;dom and &s;trength, to know and do his will.</P>
<P>After the yearly meeting at Penrith, we went to Cockermouth, and there attended a large general meeting. My concern for Hol|land continuing, and not expecting to be at home in time to attend our monthly meeting, I wrote to my brother to procure a certificate for the accompli&s;hment thereof.</P>
<P>The 3d, we went on board a ve&s;&s;el bound from Whitehaven to Dublin, and arrived at that city the 5th, having been favoured with fine weather on our pa&s;&s;age; but my &s;pirit was much &s;tripped of a &s;en&s;e of divine good, and as I drew near the city it became de|pre&s;&s;ed; in which &s;tate I landed, and proceed|ed to my lodgings, which was at Samuel Judd's. At my entering his hou&s;e, the re|membrance of dear Mary Pei&s;ley affecting|ly
<PB N="160" REF="034371_0160_0FFC2E275CE8DD18">
occurred. It was in this hou&s;e that we &s;e|parated in our return from America; and therein we had &s;pent many precious hours, in &s;weet union of &s;pirit. The national meeting began the 7th and continued till the 12th. It was a &s;ea&s;on of clo&s;e engagement and hard labour, both in the meetings for wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline; but I was favoured in it with the unity of the living members of the Society, and the helping hand of the Almighty; and in the clo&s;e, was humbly bowed before him under a &s;en&s;e of his goodne&s;s, variou&s;ly mani|fe&s;ted in &s;u&s;taining my weak body under &s;uch laborious exerci&s;es, and &s;trengthening me &s;pi|ritually to te&s;tify boldly again&s;t the &s;ins of the people: which although it might expo&s;e me to their cen&s;ure, yielded to my &s;oul the peace|able fruits of righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>After the conclu&s;ion of the national meet|ing, I reque&s;ted a friend to go and take my pa&s;&s;age, &s;aying, I mu&s;t get to our quarterly meeting; on which a friend pre&s;ent &s;aid, I &s;poke as if I had the wind at command. I re|plied, that, if the Lord appointed my being there, he would di&s;po&s;e the wind to favour it, which happened accordingly.</P>
<P>The 14th, I parted from my dear compani|on L. Bradley in much affection, and quietly went on board a ve&s;&s;el bound for Parkgate, accompanied by my friends Abraham Shack|elton, Thomas Greer, and Jo&s;eph Inman, who were going to the yearly meeting at Lon|don. We landed at our de&s;igned port the
<PB N="161" REF="034371_0161_0FFC2E2535B07DD8">
15th, and reached Stourbridge on the 17th, where the quarterly meeting for Worce&s;ter|&s;hire was to be held; and the meeting for mini&s;ters and elders began &s;oon after we came there.</P>
<P>Here I was met by my dear mother and brother, to our mutual rejoicing; and my heart was deeply affected with love and grati|tude, under the con&s;ideration of the many mercies extended to me; and &s;trong de&s;ires were rai&s;ed to be enabled &s;o to per&s;evere, as to be favoured with the continuance thereof.</P>
<P>We had a good meeting, and many Friends who attended it rejoiced to &s;ee me returned in &s;afety, and, after taking an affectionate leave of them, I went home.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<P>I STAID but a few days with my relations, but &s;et forward, with my dear brother and the before-mentioned Friends from Ireland, for the yearly meeting at London. In our way thereto we met our friends Samuel Fo|thergill and Abraham Farrington, unto whom I imparted my view of vi&s;iting Friends in Holland, wherein they &s;ympathized with me. At London I laid my concern before the meet|ing for mini&s;ters and elders; and it met the approbation of my friends, and a &s;uitable companion was prepared for me by my good Ma&s;ter, namely, Sophia Hume, of London.</P>
<P>It is worthy remarking, that when this journey was fir&s;t pre&s;ented to my mind, this friend was pointed out as a companion there|in; yet had I not freedom to write, or &s;ay any thing to her thereupon until I had thus propo&s;ed it, for the con&s;ideration of Friends; when I found that kind Providence had cared for me, as &s;he had for &s;ome time found her mind engaged to hold her&s;elf in readine&s;s to accompany &s;ome friend on a journey, though
<PB N="163" REF="034371_0163_0FFC2E204480E888">
&s;he knew not whom nor whereto, but on my mentioning my concern, &s;aw both. John Ken|dal, a Friend of Colche&s;ter, who could &s;peak Dutch, was engaged in love to accompany us. Thus does the Lord mercifully provide all things nece&s;&s;ary for &s;uch of his &s;ervants as are freely given up to run on his errands, and move &s;imply by his directions.</P>
<P>The yearly meeting at London was over&s;ha|dowed with the wing of Divine love. I had &s;ome &s;atisfactory &s;ervice therein; and on the 7th of the Sixth month I went to Plai&s;tow to vi&s;it my dear and ancient friend John Hay|ward; and here I parted in much affection with my dear brother, and with Samuel and Ann Fothergill.</P>
<P>The 9th, I went to Chelmsford, where I &s;taid until the 12th, being in want of a little re&s;t. Here my companion Sophia Hume came to me, and we went together, with Abraham Farrington, to the before-mentioned quarter|ly meetings held at Colche&s;ter, Woodbridge, and Norwich; in all of which I was labori|ou&s;ly exerci&s;ed, and the hand of my heavenly Father was with me; through which I was made &s;trong in his cau&s;e, and I hope the meet|ings ended to the honour of his worthy name. Under a &s;en&s;e thereof my &s;pirit bowed in thankfulne&s;s to him who clothes with &s;trength for the battle, and by his own right arm gets him&s;elf the victory: unto who&s;e &s;ervice may my &s;oul be bound for ever!</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="034371_0164_0FFC2E1E17659FC0">We &s;taid about three weeks in Norwich, in which city there is a large body of Friends, unto whom a powerful vi&s;itation of Divine love had latterly been extended; through the prevalence whereof divers natural members, or branches of our own &s;ociety, had in a good degree &s;ubmitted to the &s;implicity of the cro&s;s; and others had been gathered to the immedi|ate teachings of the Shepherd of I&s;rael from other religious &s;ocieties. Several had appear|ed in publick te&s;timony, for whom in an e&s;pe|cial manner our &s;pirits were exerci&s;ed, that they might honour God in their re&s;pective callings, by an exemplary conver&s;ation and a living mini&s;try. I had much &s;ervice among&s;t them in the openings of Divine wi&s;dom and love, wherein &s;ome of the dangers which at|tended them were pointed out. I was al&s;o con|cerned clo&s;ely to reprove &s;uch as had &s;u&s;tained lo&s;s in the Truth, by letting out their minds after terre&s;trial enjoyments, and were &s;eeking great things to them&s;elves, whereby the Lord's work in them was marred.</P>
<P>From Norwich we went to Harwich, and on the 21&s;t of the Seventh month, 1757, ac|companied by John Kendal, went on board the packet bound for Helvoet&s;luys, where we landed the next day. There we took a car|riage and went to the Briel, a pretty large town; but I did not find that ever any of our &s;ociety re&s;ided therein, and the people &s;eemed very ignorant re&s;pecting us: for as we walked the &s;treets, offence was taken at our friend
<PB N="165" REF="034371_0165_0FFC2E1C8C6FDA68">
John Kendal for not returning the cu&s;tomary &s;alutation of putting off the hat in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>My &s;pirit was very low on my arrival in this country, on account of the difficulty I la|boured under for want of knowing the lan|guage. Could either my&s;elf or my companion have &s;poken Dutch, we might have explained to the man, who was an officer in the army, our rea&s;ons for not returning his civility, for &s;uch it appeared to be; and he was very much irri|tated at John Kendal's not noting it as &s;uch.</P>
<P>From the Briel we went in a boat to Rot|terdam, which is a large city, wherein there was formerly a meeting of Friends, and where &s;till remains a meeting-hou&s;e, and there are a few who were educated among us; but they had &s;o little regard to the te&s;timony of Truth and the welfare of their &s;ouls, as entirely to neglect a&s;&s;embling to wor&s;hip the Almighty; yet were not content to profe&s;s with any other people. We had no inclination to call upon any of the&s;e; but having informa|tion that the meeting-hou&s;e was under the care of per&s;ons who were the de&s;cendants of friends, we called at their hou&s;e, and de&s;ired that the meeting-hou&s;e might be got in readine&s;s for us to have a meeting there at our return, which one of them promi&s;ed it &s;hould be. He behaved civilly, but appeared very di&s;|tant from the profe&s;&s;ion of his ance&s;tors. The&s;e per&s;ons were great trade&s;men, had be|come rich, and much in the grandeur of this
<PB N="166" REF="034371_0166_0FFC2E1B017DBAA8">
world, and were now of the &s;ociety of the Meni&s;ts or Bapti&s;ts.</P>
<P>The next day we went in the track&s;cuyts, by way of Delft and Leyden (in neither of which cities are any under our name), to Har|lem, where lived the per&s;on who u&s;ed to in|terpret for Friends from England: upon whom we called, but found him &s;o enfeebled, as to be entirely unfit for that &s;ervice. Here we were met by Sophia Vander Werf and her &s;on John, from Am&s;terdam. She was a wo|man of a &s;weet natural di&s;po&s;ition, came among&s;t Friends by convincement, and had received a gift in the mini&s;try, in the exerci&s;e of which I believe &s;he was acceptable to Friends. The young man had re&s;ided a con&s;iderable time in England; he &s;poke Engli&s;h well for a Dutchman, and I looked towards him for an interpreter; but although he appeared to have a &s;en&s;e of Truth, I feared his being deep enough in the experimental work of it for that &s;ervice: &s;o I &s;aid nothing to him, and proceeded to Am&s;terdam under &s;ome di&s;|couragement. In this city a lodging was pro|vided for us by Friends at the hou&s;e of A|braham Herman, which appeared the mo&s;t &s;uitable place for our reception of any belong|ing to them. He with his wife received us kindly, and treated us &s;o whil&s;t we &s;taid with them. It was Seventh-day evening when we came to Am&s;terdam, and before John Van|der Werf left us, I a&s;ked him whether he was willing to a&s;&s;i&s;t us as an interpreter; but he
<PB N="167" REF="034371_0167_0FFC2E179E750328">
mode&s;tly declined, pleading his unfitne&s;s for the &s;ervice. John Kendal al&s;o refu&s;ed, on account of his deficiency in the language to interpret in a publick meeting, although he could &s;peak Dutch in the common cour&s;e of conver&s;ation. Under the&s;e di&s;couraging cir|cum&s;tances I went to bed, be&s;eeching the Al|mighty to lay a concern upon &s;ome one to a&s;&s;i&s;t me. when I ro&s;e in the morning, my &s;pirit was low, yet not doubtful of my being right in coming into this country. In this &s;tate I went to meeting without any expectation of an interpreter being provided for me at that meeting; and therefore rather expected to be &s;ilent therein. The meeting was pretty large, but we were told, le&s;s than at &s;ome other times: for although there are but few pro|fe&s;&s;ing the Truth in this city, it is cu&s;tomary for people of all religious &s;ocieties, nations, and qualities, who come there on account of bu&s;ine&s;s or plea&s;ure, to go to our meetings, mo&s;t of them doubtle&s;s from the motive of curio&s;ity; but the &s;olidity of the countenance and de|meanour of &s;ome pre&s;ent, and the knowledge I afterwards had of them, convinced me that they were actuated by a better motive.</P>
<P>In the fore part of the meeting, my &s;pirit was much exerci&s;ed and broken under the con|&s;ideration of having no interpreter; yet &s;up|ported in hope of the provi&s;ion of Providence: for it appeared to me incon&s;i&s;tent with Divine wi&s;dom and mercy to bring me hither, and not to open the way for me to convey his will
<PB N="168" REF="034371_0168_0FFC2E156F4C3720">
to the people. After &s;ome time a Dutch friend bore a &s;hort te&s;timony; and &s;oon after he &s;at down, &s;omething aro&s;e in my mind, by way of information to the people re&s;pecting our motives for coming among&s;t them; and I was quickly favoured with &s;trength to &s;tand up, intending to &s;ay that I had &s;omething to communicate to them, which if any one pre|&s;ent would interpret, I would impart, but I was not obliged to proceed thus far, for upon &s;eeing me ri&s;e, John Vander Werf ro&s;e al&s;o, came and &s;tood by me in the gallery, and in|terpreted what I &s;aid to the pre&s;ent relief of my &s;pirit, and the &s;atisfaction of &s;uch friends pre&s;ent as under&s;tood both Dutch and Eng|li&s;h.</P>
<P>I found it &s;o difficult to convey the doctrines of Truth in this way to the people, that it appeared almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to get relief of mind, or liberty of expre&s;&s;ion, to that degree I had &s;ometimes been favoured in my own tongue. I &s;poke a &s;entence, and &s;topped for the inter|preter to &s;peak it after me; and I was thank|ful that kind Providence had &s;o far an&s;wered my belief of his providing for me; and was comforted in the hope that his ble&s;&s;ing, which alone maketh fruitful, might be dropt upon my weak endeavours for the exaltation of his Truth. The meeting ended in &s;olemn &s;up|plication, in which exerci&s;e I had no interpre|ter, John Vander Werf being unwilling to undertake that awful &s;ervice. Some pre&s;ent might under&s;tand Engli&s;h well enough to
<PB N="169" REF="034371_0169_0FFC2E13C259F978">
comprehend what I &s;aid; and others, I be|lieve, were &s;en&s;ible of the Divine power which over&s;hadowed the meeting.</P>
<P>The afternoon meeting was neither &s;o large, nor yet &s;o &s;atisfactory, as that of the morn|ing; which I thought might be occa&s;ioned by a fellow-mini&s;ter withholding what Divine wi&s;|dom required to di&s;tribute; whereby my &s;er|vice to the people appeared to be impeded, and, the life of truth being low, I &s;aid but little. I left the meeting under &s;ome di&s;|couragement, yet not without hope of being more at liberty before I left the city.</P>
<P>We &s;taid in and about Am&s;terdam till the 5th of the Eighth month, in all which time we had no meeting but in the city; nor did it appear likely we &s;hould have many el&s;ewhere in the country, by rea&s;on of my interpreter being clerk to a merchant, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s did not admit of his being much ab&s;ent, &s;ave on Fir&s;t-days. In this time we had &s;everal pret|ty good opportunities with Friends and the people; yet I &s;eemed as an amba&s;&s;ador in bonds, but laboured to be content in the pre&s;ent di&s;pen&s;ation. We were vi&s;ited by &s;everal religious people, with &s;ome of whom I felt a degree of union in the Truth; but &s;aw their lo&s;s in running after notions, and not &s;ettling in the ground of true &s;ilence, wherein the mind becomes e&s;tabli&s;hed in rec|titude: and it appeared proper to &s;et them an example therein; and to be cautious of running into religious di&s;cour&s;e (to which
<PB N="170" REF="034371_0170_0FFC2E11961EA4B8">
they are much addicted), without feeling liber|ty for it in the Truth. We vi&s;ited a religious Meni&s;t, and had &s;ome &s;atisfactory &s;ervice in his family. There are a number among that peo|ple who are near to Chri&s;t's kingdom, though not fully redeemed from inefficacious ceremo|nies, and a dependence on in&s;trumental mini&s;|try, or at lea&s;t a fondne&s;s for it.</P>
<P>The 5th of the Eighth month, we went in the track&s;cuyts, as far as Horn, towards Twi&s;k, our friend Sophia Vander Werf accompanying us. At Horn we called on two religious Meni&s;ts; the one a preacher among&s;t them, who &s;eemed more gathered into &s;tillne&s;s than mo&s;t of that per&s;ua&s;ion, and his wife near the Truth; the other much inclined to di&s;|cour&s;e on religious matters, in who&s;e family I found an engagement to leave a &s;hort te&s;|timony to the benefit of &s;ilence, which they appeared to receive well. As we pa&s;&s;ed through the towns, we &s;cattered &s;ome books &s;etting forth our principles. A friend from Twi&s;k met us here with a waggon, wherein we went home with him that evening.</P>
<P>At Twi&s;k there is a &s;mall meeting of pro|fe&s;&s;ors of Truth, but we found them much in the mixture, and &s;ome of them &s;o exalted in notion, that it was hard fa&s;tening any &s;olid doctrine upon them. We were at two meet|ings with them, and &s;everal of the Meni&s;ts; both of which were exerci&s;ing, that in the morning particularly &s;o; but I was comforted with an evidence that my &s;ervice, weak and
<PB N="171" REF="034371_0171_0FFC2E0ECC086DD8">
imperfect as it appeared to me, was accepted of Him who employed me. The afternoon-meeting was more &s;atisfactory, although labo|rious. The Meni&s;t preacher before-mention|ed, with his wife and &s;on, were with us, in who&s;e company we had a degree of &s;atisfac|tion. The next morning we procured a &s;elect opportunity with mo&s;t of the friends belong|ing to the meeting, at the hou&s;e of a valuable woman friend, who&s;e circum&s;tances demanded our &s;ympathy; &s;he dwelling &s;olitarily and having been many years confined through extreme weakne&s;s. She was &s;uch a pattern of re&s;ignation and cheerful innocence, as I had rarely &s;een. Her very countenance be|&s;poke acquie&s;cence with the allotment of Pro|vidence, and not one complaining word dropt from her. This meeting tended to the relief of our &s;pirits, and we took leave of the &s;aid friend and others in love, and returned to Am&s;terdam, again di&s;per&s;ing &s;ome books in our way; which was all we could do, as our interpreter could not &s;tay with us to have meetings in the towns.</P>
<P>On our return to Am&s;terdam, we vi&s;ited almo&s;t all who could be accounted members of our &s;ociety, in their families, and attended the meetings on Fir&s;t and week-days, as they came in cour&s;e, until the 21&s;t: in which time I had &s;everal good opportunities with the people of that city, and the &s;trangers who attended the meetings, and left it in peace.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="034371_0172_0FFC2E0D06CEFF08">One vi&s;it we paid in Am&s;terdam was &s;o remarkable in its con&s;equence, that I note it, viz. A man who was convinced of Truth, had a turbulent &s;pirited wife; who had violently oppo&s;ed his going among&s;t Friends; and af|ter one meeting which he attended with us, railed much; neverthele&s;s, &s;he &s;ent us an in|vitation to &s;up with her, and it appeared be&s;t for us to accept it. She provided hand&s;omely for us, but &s;eemed to be in a wrangling &s;pirit. She talked about dre&s;s being an indifferent matter; upon which I told her, that the a|dorning of Chri&s;tian women, &s;hould be that of a
<Q>meek and quiet &s;pirit, which in the &s;ight of God was of great price.</Q>
This &s;truck and &s;ilenced her, and &s;he afterwards behaved obligingly to us. After we had paid this vi|&s;it, her hu&s;band told us, that &s;ome time be|fore, as they were going to bed, &s;he, being in a very bad temper, would not let him re&s;t; and, although he was in bed before her, I think he aro&s;e again. She took up the Bible, I &s;uppo&s;e, to convince him of his errors, and opened it upon this very text; which then &s;o affected her, that &s;he condemned her&s;elf, kneel|ed down to pray for forgivene&s;s, and promi&s;ed that &s;he would never more treat him &s;o im|properly; but &s;he had not kept her promi&s;e, and the text being now revived in her remem|brance, it again affected her. We were quite ignorant of the circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>The 21&s;t, we had a meeting at Harlem to good &s;atisfaction. We lodged at I&s;aac Van
<PB N="173" REF="034371_0173_0FFC2E0ADC5F2730">
We&s;tercappel's, who furni&s;hed us with a room to hold a meeting in, and gave notice of it to the people. He was de&s;cended from friends by the mother's &s;ide, but he him&s;elf never made profe&s;&s;ion with us. He was exceedingly kind to us, and, with his family, appeared to be &s;eeking after the be&s;t things. In the evening we had the company of &s;ome &s;eeking people, mo&s;t of them of the offspring of friends, with whom we had conver&s;ation upon religious &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>In our publick meeting at this place, I was more at liberty in the exerci&s;e of my gift, than had been u&s;ual with me in Holland; at which I afterwards admired, being told that my interpreter was uncommonly defective in rendering what I &s;aid into Dutch. This cir|cum&s;tance &s;ometimes revolved in my remem|brance, accompanied with &s;ome kind of doubt re&s;pecting my being &s;o much at liberty to &s;peak, when what I delivered was not well interpreted to the people; but after &s;ome years, a friend of Norwich told me, that there was at that meeting a &s;en&s;ible man, a Jew, who under&s;tood the Engli&s;h tongue well, who told him that he had attended the meeting, and that my interpreter did not do me ju&s;tice; but, continued he,
<Q>It was no matter, as all &s;he &s;aid was directed to me:</Q>
and my friend added, that it &s;o affected him, that he believed he would freely interpret for me, &s;hould I ever want his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. This relation re|moved my before-mentioned doubt, for the
<PB N="174" REF="034371_0174_0FFC2E08AC04D450">
word preached found its way to one mind, for which in Divine wi&s;dom it was appoint|ed.</P>
<P>The 22d, we parted with my interpreter John Vander Werf for whom I was concern|ed, and &s;ympathi&s;ed with him, as he was left almo&s;t alone (in regard to Friends), and much expo&s;ed in the cour&s;e of his bu&s;ine&s;s; and from the affability and &s;prightline&s;s of his di&s;po&s;ition, he appeared to be in much danger: but I conceived hope in the &s;en&s;e of the extendings of divine goodne&s;s being &s;ingu|larly towards him. We al&s;o took leave of our kind ho&s;t J. Van We&s;tercappel and &s;everal of his family and friends in love and tender|ne&s;s, and went to Rotterdam, whither his daughter Su&s;anna Van We&s;tercappel, a &s;erious agreeable young woman, and our friend So|phia Vander Werf accompanied us. In our way, we di&s;tributed books to &s;ome people in the track&s;cuyts, and the &s;ame evening had a meeting at Rotterdam with &s;ome people who under&s;tood Engli&s;h, of which there are many in that place.</P>
<P>The 23d, our kind friends Sophia Vander Werf and Su&s;anna Van We&s;tercappel left us, and we went to the Briel, and thence, the 24th, to Helvoet&s;luys. In our way from Rotter|dam to this place we met with &s;everal per&s;ons who were going to England, with whom we had much di&s;cour&s;e concerning our religious principles, I believe mea&s;urably to our mutual &s;atisfaction. One of them was a Swede, a
<PB N="175" REF="034371_0175_0FFC2E05E271AC38">
Lutheran by profe&s;&s;ion; he was favoured with a good under&s;tanding, and had a mind &s;u&s;cepti|ble of religious impre&s;&s;ions; although his con|ver&s;ation was not &s;o uniformly exemplary as could have been de&s;ired.</P>
<P>On coming to Helvoet&s;luys, we found that the wind was again&s;t our &s;ailing for England, and that the inn was full of company many of whom were waiting for their pa&s;&s;age to England: &s;o the landlord put us in a hou&s;e which was ready furni&s;hed, and we became a family to our&s;elves, being furni&s;hed with pro|vi&s;ions from the inn. The wind continuing contrary until the Fir&s;t-day of the week, and there being in the place many people of di|vers nations and &s;tations who could &s;peak Engli&s;h; with the concurrence and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of our landlord and company, we got our dining-room well &s;eated; and on the Fir&s;t-day morning held a meeting in it, whereto the &s;trangers pretty generally came. I was favoured to declare the Truth among&s;t them, to the relief of my own &s;pirit, and I believe to the comfort and &s;atisfaction of my compa|nions; but the labour was hard, through the unpreparedne&s;s of the hearts of &s;ome to re|ceive, and perhaps the want of a &s;ufficient knowledge of the language in others, to un|der&s;tand, the doctrines delivered.</P>
<P>The 29th in the evening, the wind turned in our favour, and continued &s;o, until about the middle of the next day; but our captain would not put to &s;ea without a pretty &s;teady
<PB N="176" REF="034371_0176_0FFC2E0456F4E460">
wind, becau&s;e of the French privateers: how|ever, we went on board that day and &s;et &s;ail, and the wind being very boi&s;terous our jib-&s;ail was &s;oon rent; and another packet boat go|ing out with us, &s;truck upon the Pales, broke a hole in her &s;ide, and, as the pa&s;&s;engers &s;aid, was in danger of being lo&s;t. The wind con|tinuing to blow hard and contrary, we &s;oon came to an anchor, and the next morning re|turned back to Helvoet&s;luys; and the follow|ing day, the 1&s;t of the Ninth month, we were favoured with a fair wind, and arrived at Harwich the 2d, in peace and thankfulne&s;s to the Almighty. I had to admire his good|ne&s;s, in thus pre&s;erving and &s;upporting my body and mind by &s;ea and land, and through all the exerci&s;es attendant on this journey, among&s;t a people of a &s;trange language.</P>
<P>Even our detention at Helvoet&s;luys appear|ed to be in the ordering of Divine wi&s;dom and mercy to the people there vi&s;ited; and in our &s;elect company we had frequent opportunities of conver&s;ing upon edifying &s;ubjects; &s;ome of our companions &s;eeming willing to gain infor|mation re&s;pecting Friends and their principles. Once the &s;ubject of &s;elf-defence was &s;tarted, which they might probably think we could not invalidate; but we were enabled to give a rea&s;on for di&s;&s;enting from them in &s;entiment, and on its being queried what we would do if attacked, and mu&s;t either be killed, or kill. I &s;aid I could not &s;ay how I &s;hould act at &s;uch a juncture, wherein nature might be impro|perly
<PB N="177" REF="034371_0177_0FFC2E0232B59CF8">
rai&s;ed; but that now being favoured with the hope of my immortal &s;pirit's cen|tering &s;afe, and knowing that a per&s;on who &s;ought my life mu&s;t be in an unfit &s;tate to en|ter Chri&s;t's holy kingdom, I &s;hould rather choo&s;e to die, than plunge that &s;oul into ever|la&s;ting mi&s;ery; and &s;hould have greatly the advantage in being relea&s;ed from this &s;tate of trials. They heard with attention, and the Swede with tears in his eyes, replied,
<Q>The&s;e are indeed &s;ublime &s;entiments.</Q></P>
<P>We had been &s;o long detained at Hel|voet&s;luys, that our money grew &s;hort, but the captain &s;aid we &s;hould have what we wanted from him; however, we had enough to pay our pa&s;&s;age, and bear our expen&s;es (excepting the hire of our chai&s;e) to Colche&s;ter: which we reached almo&s;t pennyle&s;s the 3d, and were affectionately received by John Kendal's mo|ther, and other friends. Here I drew a bill, and obtained money, and my companion, Sophia Hume, got enough to carry her to London.</P>
<P>After a &s;hort &s;tay at Colche&s;ter, I went with my companion Sophia Hume to Kelvedon, where we were favoured with a comfortable meeting with Friends, and parting in much love, &s;he went for London. She had been to me a &s;teady, affectionate, &s;ympathi&s;ing com|panion; and although in this journey, not much engaged in publick mini&s;try, &s;he was very helpful in meetings, through a deep &s;pi|ritual exerci&s;e; and being endowed with a
<PB N="178" REF="034371_0178_0FFC2E000FAF5D98">
good under&s;tanding, both naturally and &s;pirit|ually, &s;he was qualified to give an an&s;wer of "her faith and the hope that was in her:" and I was often thankful to the bounteous Author of all my mercies, for furni&s;hing me with &s;o &s;uitable a companion.</P>
<P>From Kelvedon, I went without any com|panion, through &s;everal meetings, to Nor|wich, where I was favoured in the &s;ervice ap|pointed me, but &s;taid there only a few days; proceeding thence, through &s;ome meetings in Lincoln&s;hire, to the quarterly meeting at York; where I again met with Abraham Farrington, who with many more of my friends, rejoiced at my being returned to my native land in peace and &s;afety.</P>
<P>From York, I pa&s;&s;ed through &s;everal meet|ings in that county, wherein the Lord was plea&s;ed to vary the di&s;pen&s;ations of his wi&s;|dom, by dipping me into a &s;tate of great &s;uf|fering; which I could not get above, but which I &s;aw to be good, near the clo&s;e of a journey wherein I had been &s;o eminently fa|voured; as it tended to pre&s;erve me from clothing my&s;elf with the Lord's jewels, and humbled my &s;pirit to the very du&s;t. From York&s;hire I went to Manche&s;ter and War|rington, where I regained a little liberty in the Truth, and &s;o proceeded to &s;ome meetings in Che&s;hire; in one of which I thought I was rai&s;ed higher, in the Divine life, in the exer|ci&s;e of my gift, than I had been throughout the journey. Thus does Divine wi&s;dom abu&s;e
<PB N="179" REF="034371_0179_0FFC2DFD4597BB70">
and exalt at his plea&s;ure, unto whom be glory, honour, and prai&s;e a&s;cribed, now and for ever.</P>
<P>The 15th of the Tenth month, I got home, to the mutual &s;atisfaction of my&s;elf and rela|tions; and, notwith&s;tanding my great fatigue, in a rather better &s;tate of health than when I left it; and found my dear and aged mother well: and here I al&s;o met my dear friend Lu|cy Bradley, who was returning home from her vi&s;it to Friends in Ireland, and our rejoic|ing one in another was mutual.</P>
<P>The 17th, we went together to our month|ly meeting, wherein I gave to Friends &s;ome account of my &s;ervice and &s;atisfaction in this journey; and my &s;pirit was much humbled in a &s;en&s;e of the providential care and abundant loving-kindne&s;s of a merciful God, variou&s;ly di&s;played to this period of my life.</P>
<P>This winter I &s;pent much about home, and among&s;t my relations: not in idlene&s;s, for I was very clo&s;ely engaged either in attend|ing monthly or quarterly meetings, or other &s;ervices.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<P>THE 6th of the Fourth month, 1758, I left home, to attend the yearly meet|ings of Wales, Bri&s;tol, and London; in all which, e&s;pecially the two fir&s;t, I was Divine|ly favoured; and returned home, in peace and thankfulne&s;s, in the Fifth month.</P>
<P>Towards the fall of the year, I attended our circular yearly meeting held at Kiddermin|&s;ter, which was large and very &s;atisfactory. After this meeting, being inclined to vi&s;it &s;ome provincial meetings, &amp;c. in Ireland, I went with my dear friend Samuel Fothergill to Warrington, and thence proceeded to Liver|pool, in order to take &s;hipping for Dublin; but finding no ve&s;&s;el there ready to &s;ail, I &s;ent to inquire whether any one was going from Parkgate; and the me&s;&s;enger returning, &s;aid there was one, but that &s;he would &s;ail the next tide, and that it was then too late to reach her. I was pretty earne&s;t to try, but &s;ome friends, who I thought were acquaint|ed with the time of the tide's turning, di&s;|&s;uaded me from attempting it. So I gave it
<PB N="181" REF="034371_0181_0FFC2DF946E27B50">
up reluctantly, fearing I &s;hould lo&s;e the op|portunity of getting my pa&s;&s;age in time for the meetings; and I afterwards heard that the tide did not turn till an hour after the time they &s;aid it would; &s;o had I gone, I might probably have reached the ve&s;&s;el in time.</P>
<P>I waited at Liverpool more than a week, mo&s;t of that time in almo&s;t con&s;tant expecta|tion of &s;ailing, a ve&s;&s;el being &s;oon ready to &s;ail, but the wind was contrary. At length I went on board, and we &s;et &s;ail with a fair wind, but it quickly turned again&s;t us, and we lay all night at anchor in a &s;mall harbour called Hoylake. The wind blew hard, and I e&s;teemed it a &s;ingular favour that our captain was per&s;uaded to lay at anchor; for we might have been in imminent danger of peri&s;hing among the &s;and-banks, had he &s;tood out to &s;ea; which I had &s;ome rea&s;on to believe he would have done, had I not been on board; for I being &s;et to a day in getting to Dublin, in order to attend the province-meetings, had reque&s;ted him, if there were not a probabili|ty of our making our pa&s;&s;age in time, to &s;et me on &s;hore &s;omewhere in Great Britain; which he promi&s;ed to do if he could. The ve&s;&s;el being &s;mall and very full of pa&s;&s;engers, who in the night crowded into the cabin, it was &s;o extremely clo&s;e, that I was much af|flicted both in body and mind: under which I &s;ought for Divine direction re&s;pecting pro|ceeding
<PB N="182" REF="034371_0182_0FFC2DF673AD6A78">
forward in the ve&s;&s;el &s;hould the wind prove favourable in the morning.</P>
<P>I thought I felt my mind turned to the &s;hore, and relea&s;ed from the weight of the journey, at lea&s;t for the pre&s;ent; therefore when it was light, I de&s;ired the captain to endeavour to put me on &s;hore, and he accordingly hung out a flag for a boat to come and take me; but none came, and as the wind was again &s;hifted in their favour, and it appeared hazard|ous to &s;end the &s;hip's boat with me, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould not return time enough for her &s;ailing, I feared I mu&s;t &s;tay with them; but unex|pectedly the captain offered the boat and men, provided I would be left on the beach with my &s;addle and clothes, and let the men return to the ve&s;&s;el immediately; to which I agreed, and left the ve&s;&s;el, under the probability of her making her pa&s;&s;age. A poor woman of Ireland who had no mind to proceed in her, went on &s;hore with me, who, with her little girl, carried my &s;addle, &amp;c. about half a mile, to a publick hou&s;e, where I breakfa&s;ted, and got a man and hor&s;es to take me to Liver|pool. I proceeded pen&s;ively, le&s;t I &s;hould have mi&s;&s;ed my way in leaving the ve&s;&s;el; yet I could commit my ca&s;e to the Lord, who knew I had acted in &s;implicity. In our way we &s;aw the ve&s;&s;el under &s;ail, ju&s;t turning out of the harbour on her cour&s;e. When we reached Liverpool I was much fatigued, and low both in body and mind, having &s;lept little in the night; but after &s;ome re&s;t I attended
<PB N="183" REF="034371_0183_0FFC2DF4E90A06F8">
the funeral of a child the &s;ame evening, and in the meeting the Lord &s;o favoured, that my fears about leaving the ve&s;&s;el in a great degree vani&s;hed. After meeting I found that the wind was turned again&s;t her, and continued to blow very hard all that night; and the next morning the ve&s;&s;el came back to Liver|pool. I &s;taid there the next day, and then return|ed to Warrington, and was at the meetings at Penketh and Warrington, the next day, and &s;o proceeded home, taking in my way thither a meeting at Nantwich. Although I had been thus di&s;appointed, I had rea&s;on to hope that my leaving home was not without &s;ome fruit to others as well as to my&s;elf; &s;o that my &s;oul had cau&s;e to ble&s;s the &s;acred name of Him, who &s;anctifies every trial to his chil|dren.</P>
<P>The day I &s;taid at Liverpool, I penned the rough draught of an Epi&s;tle to friends in Ire|land, and after my return home tran&s;cribed and &s;ent it.</P>
<P>My mind &s;ettled in quiet after this di&s;ap|pointment, but my body had &s;uffered &s;o much, that a little re&s;t &s;eemed nece&s;&s;ary to repair my health; and I entertained a hope of being at and about home this winter; but Divine wi&s;dom pointed out work for me el&s;ewhere, and my mind was re&s;igned to follow his direc|tions. I left home in the Twelfth month, and went to the quarterly meeting at War|wick, where through much painful labour of &s;pirit, I was favoured to di&s;charge the duty
<PB N="184" REF="034371_0184_0FFC2DF2C6BAE298">
required of me, to the relief of my own &s;pirit and the &s;atisfaction of experienced friends. From that place I went, through &s;everal meet|ings in Oxford&s;hire and Northampton&s;hire, to the quarterly meeting at Northampton; and, turning back to the monthly meeting at Ban|bury, vi&s;ited &s;ome other meetings in Oxford|&s;hire, and attended the quarterly meeting held at Oxford. In all the&s;e &s;ervices the &s;up|porting protecting arm of Divine goodne&s;s was near, whereby I was conducted in &s;afe|ty; though not without con&s;iderable dan|ger from the badne&s;s of the roads. I had one very dangerous fall from my hor&s;e, but was mercifully pre&s;erved from any frac|ture.</P>
<P>The quarterly meeting at Oxford was at|tended by many of the &s;tudents, who mo&s;tly behaved well, although the doctrine of Truth ran very clo&s;e and pointed to them. That Divine power with which they were too much unacquainted, bound down their &s;pirits. May it be prai&s;ed for ever.</P>
<P>From Oxford, I pa&s;&s;ed through &s;everal meetings wherein Truth favoured, pretty directly for London; where I &s;taid about five weeks vi&s;iting the meetings of Friends, and attending other &s;ervices as I was favour|ed with &s;trength. Sometimes, through a fear of exceeding, I apprehend I fell &s;hort of my commi&s;&s;ion, and a degree of &s;uf|fering followed; which was however le&s;s painful to me, than what would have ari&s;en
<PB N="185" REF="034371_0185_0FFC2DF0871E1CF0">
from errors on the other hand. I laboured and &s;uffered much in this city, and the &s;tate of my health was poor during my &s;tay in it; but through infinite mercy I left it in the enjoyment of a good degree of peace, and re|turned home in the Second month, 1759, to the mutual rejoicing of my&s;elf and friends. My friend Ann Fothergill and &s;everal others accompanied me to &s;ome meetings in my way home, and took me in their carriages; who&s;e affectionate care in my weak &s;tate of health, I commemorate with thankfulne&s;s to the ever|bounteous Author of all my mercies.</P>
<P>The day after I got home, my dear mother was taken ill, as was my brother a few days after, and the &s;tate of my own health was weak, and &s;ome peculiar exerci&s;es attended me. Some libertine &s;pirits endeavoured to invalidate my character and &s;ervice, for no other cau&s;e than what appeared to me to be my duty. This was an extremely trying &s;ea|&s;on, but I hope in the end it was profitable, and tended to e&s;tabli&s;h my mind in a patient &s;uffering of reproach, and to guard me with caution that I might not admini&s;ter occa&s;ion for it to the adver&s;aries of Truth.</P>
<P>I attended to &s;ervices about home, as liberty and &s;trength were afforded, and became better in my health: my mother al&s;o recovered bravely, but my brother continued in a very weak &s;tate. In the Fourth month I was obliged to leave him, and my dear mother, being drawn to attend the circular yearly
<PB N="186" REF="034371_0186_0FFC2DEE59AAB1A8">
meeting for the four northern counties, which was this year held at Stockport in Che&s;hire. It was very large, and &s;ignally attended with the humbling power of Truth; and the Lord was plea&s;ed to make u&s;e of me and &s;everal other of his &s;ervants: for which my &s;oul wor&s;hipped before Him who humbleth and ex|alteth, and, in his un&s;earchable wi&s;dom, doth all things well. I returned home, and found my dear mother and brother much in the &s;ame &s;tate as I left them.</P>
<P>In the Fifth month I again left home, in|tending to attend our quarterly meeting at Eve&s;ham, and &s;o proceed to the yearly meeting at London. My brother was &s;o much recovered as to accompany me to the quarterly meeting, from whence he intended to return home; but on our fir&s;t day's journey he was taken very ill. This brought a fre&s;h exerci&s;e upon me, under which I petitioned the Almighty that he would be plea&s;ed to direct me how to act for the re|lief of my own mind, and the di&s;charge of that duty which I owed to an affectionate brother; on who&s;e account I intreated, that if he might be relieved, the way for it might be pointed out. Under this exerci&s;e I proceeded to Eve&s;ham, my brother &s;till accompanying me, though very weak. After the &s;ervice of the quarterly meet|ing was over, my way opened to Worce&s;ter; whereto my brother was per&s;uaded to accom|pany me, and to take the advice of a phy&s;ician, who &s;trongly pre&s;&s;ed his going to Bath. Upon con&s;idering the urgency of his ca&s;e, &s;ome of my
<PB N="187" REF="034371_0187_0FFC2DEB663A02C0">
friends with my&s;elf judged it be&s;t for him to proceed there directly, as returning home fir&s;t would but weaken him the more: &s;o I wrote an account of our determination to my dear mother and &s;i&s;ter, who acquie&s;ced therein. I al&s;o inform|ed my brother and &s;i&s;ter Young of my afflicting &s;ituation, and reque&s;ted that one of them would accompany him; and Providence &s;o ordered it, that my &s;i&s;ter came prepared for the journey the day after I &s;ent for her. The next day, being the Fir&s;t of the week, we were favoured toge|ther by Divine goodne&s;s; and the following morning we parted in much affection, and they proceeded to Bath, and I was at liberty to pur|&s;ue my journey. This had been to me an ex|tremely exerci&s;ing &s;ea&s;on, from the great fear I was under of erring on either hand; but I re|cord it to the prai&s;e of Infinite goodne&s;s, who, in this critical juncture, directed me to act for the help of my dear brother; unto whom my en|deavours were &s;ignally ble&s;&s;ed with &s;ucce&s;s, the Bath waters being rendered &s;erviceable to him.</P>
<P>From Worce&s;ter I went to Coventry; and in the way had a meeting at Henly in Arden, Warwick&s;hire, in which place Friends have a meeting-hou&s;e, but none of our &s;ociety remain|ed. At Coventry, I met my friend Samuel Fothergill, who having been long indi&s;po&s;ed, I was rejoiced to &s;ee that it appeared likely he would be again re&s;tored to the &s;ervice of Truth. We went, together with many friends from the North of England, direct to London: where I was favoured with &s;trength to attend
<PB N="188" REF="034371_0188_0FFC2DE9DA9B3BC8">
pretty clo&s;ely to the &s;ervice of the yearly meeting, and had full &s;atisfaction that I was there in the direction of Divine wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>From London I went to the quarterly meet|ing at Colche&s;ter, and in my way there attended the Fir&s;t-day meeting at Cogge&s;hall, which was large, and favoured with the Divine pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>I left Colche&s;ter before the concluding meet|ing, being pre&s;&s;ed in my mind to reach the quarterly meeting at Banbury in Oxford&s;hire, which, with very hard travelling, I accompli&s;h|ed. I had &s;ome meetings in the way, and was comforted in admini&s;tering a little relief to &s;ome poor &s;ouls who appeared ready to faint under their exerci&s;es. After the quarterly meeting at Banbury, I went to that at North|ampton, much in the cro&s;s to my own will, being very de&s;irous to get home, con&s;idering the &s;tate of our family, and that my own health was affected with very hard travelling, mini&s;terial labour, and exerci&s;e of mind. But I did not lo&s;e my reward, for I was favoured with &s;trength &s;ufficient for the &s;ervice required, went from Northampton in much peace and thankfulne&s;s, and reached home in two days after: where I was gladly received by my dear aged mother and &s;i&s;ter, but my brother was not yet returned from Bath. In the la&s;t fifteen days before I got home, I attended twenty-three meetings, be&s;ides other &s;ervices, and travelled on hor&s;eback.</P>
<P>The concern I had for Ireland reviving, I left home in the Eighth month, and with very
<PB N="189" REF="034371_0189_0FFC2DE7AFE1FEE0">
hard travelling was favoured to vi&s;it mo&s;t of the meetings in that nation this fall, and re|turned to England &s;oon after the half-year's meeting in the Eleventh month. A religious young woman, Sarah Chri&s;tie, not in the mi|ni&s;try, accompanied me through the greate&s;t part of the journey in Ireland. I landed from Ireland at Whitehaven, and went through the meetings in &s;ome part of Cumberland, the Bi&s;hoprick of Durham, and the ea&s;t &s;ide of York&s;hire; and turned to the quarterly meet|ing for We&s;tmoreland in the Fir&s;t month 1760. The weather being extremely &s;harp this win|ter, and my health but poor through hard travelling, and taking cold, I &s;uffered much in body; but gracious Providence &s;upported and carried me through the &s;ervice required, to the admiration of my&s;elf and others. The weakne&s;s of my con&s;titution appeared inade|quate to &s;o great a fatigue; but I experienced that hand which employed me, to be &s;trength in weakne&s;s: &s;alvation and power be a&s;cribed thereto for ever!</P>
<P>In the beginning of the Fourth month my &s;i&s;ter Ann was married to Thomas Summer|field, of Bloxham, Oxford&s;hire; and my bro|ther, who accompanied her to her new habita|tion, returned home very ill; yet I could not be ea&s;y to omit the attendance of the Welch year|ly meeting held this year at O&s;we&s;try, and my &s;i&s;ter Young kindly &s;taid with him and my mother in my ab&s;ence. The meeting was very large; and I had good rea&s;on to believe I was
<PB N="190" REF="034371_0190_0FFC2DE55BABB5B0">
there in the coun&s;el of the Almighty. I re|turned home in little more than a week, where I found my brother yet unwell; neverthele&s;s I thought it right to leave him again in a few days, being engaged to attend the yearly meetings of Bri&s;tol and London: which I did, taking &s;ome meetings in my way.</P>
<P>The yearly meeting at London was large and very &s;atisfactory, except from &s;ome di&s;tur|bance which was given to Friends meetings by &s;ome di&s;orderly per&s;ons not in unity with them. My &s;trength in the di&s;charge of my duty was mercifully renewed, and an enlarged|ne&s;s of heart experienced towards my brethren. I had left home through much difficulty, but was thankful that I had pre&s;&s;ed through it; and on my return I had rea&s;on to believe that kind Providence had made up the lo&s;s of my company to my mother and brother; for I found her cheerful, and him in better health.</P>
<P>I came home in the Sixth month, and &s;taid at or near it until the latter end of the Eighth, labouring as I found ability in the &s;ervice of Truth, and endeavouring to di&s;charge my duty in dome&s;tick cares: a greater weight whereof than heretofore re&s;ted upon me &s;ince my &s;i&s;ter's marriage; through which, and my brother's continued indi&s;po&s;ition, my way in leaving home was &s;traitened; yet I know not that any clear manife&s;tation of duty was omitted; al|though &s;ometimes it was di&s;charged with dif|ficulty.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="034371_0191_0FFC2DE3234F5E20">My brother being &s;omewhat better, I left home in order to vi&s;it Friends meetings in Der|by&s;hire, &s;ome of the dales of York&s;hire, and part of Lanca&s;hire. I was favoured to ac|compli&s;h this journey in forty-eight days, tra|velling in that time about 700 miles, and at|tending fifty-two meetings, be&s;ides other &s;er|vices, often in Friends' families, by which hard labour my &s;pirits were much exhau&s;ted, yet was not my health &s;o impaired, but that I hoped with re&s;t it might be re&s;tored.</P>
<P>In this journey I had &s;ome &s;atisfactory &s;er|vice among people not profe&s;&s;ing with us; and &s;ome in towns where no meetings were held. At Bradford in Lanca&s;hire, &s;ome unthinking people and children di&s;turbed our meeting al|mo&s;t through the whole time of our holding it; but &s;ome &s;ober inquiring people attended it, with whom we had rea&s;on to hope the te&s;|timony of Truth had place. After the meet|ing we had a &s;atisfactory opportunity with &s;ome of them at the hou&s;e of one that had lately joined Friends in that place. Some friends accompanied me in this &s;ervice, viz. Jonathan Raine and his wife, of Craw&s;hay Booth meeting, Matthew Meller of Man|che&s;ter, and &s;everal others; from whom I parted in go&s;pel love.</P>
<P>On my return home the 16th of the Tenth month, I had the &s;atisfaction to find my dear mother well, and my brother better than he had been. The night before I came there, I
<PB N="192" REF="034371_0192_0FFC2DE0F1628078">
had a fall from my hor&s;e, but through mer|cy received no hurt.</P>
<P>The 17th of the Eleventh month, I &s;et out to attend our quarterly meeting at Worce&s;ter, which was large and mercifully favoured with the Divine pre&s;ence. From thence I went to Leo|min&s;ter to vi&s;it my &s;i&s;ter Young and her family; and &s;pent a few days with them and friends there profitably. In my way home, accompanied with &s;everal friends from Leomin&s;ter, I had a large meeting at Ludlow, in which town there was only one that profe&s;&s;ed with us. Several &s;o|ber people were among&s;t tho&s;e who attended this meeting; and Divine goodne&s;s was plea&s;ed to favour with opening the Truths of the go&s;pel unto them. I left the town that night, at which I was not quite ea&s;y, not knowing but if I had &s;taid, &s;ome inquiring people might have &s;ought an opportunity of conver|&s;ation. I returned home the 27th, and found my mother tolerably well, on who&s;e account, in this ab&s;ence from her, I had been concern|ed, con&s;idering her advanced age.</P>
<P>In the Twelfth month, I went to the quar|terly meeting at Warwick, and thence to vi&s;it my &s;i&s;ter in Oxford&s;hire; with whom I &s;pent a few days, vi&s;ited &s;ome meetings in the neigh|bourhood; and proceeded to Oxford. Many of the &s;tudents and others not profe&s;&s;ing with us, came to the meeting; towards whom Di|vine Wi&s;dom was plea&s;ed to manife&s;t his re|gard, and &s;ome of them behaved &s;oberly. It was the time of the quarterly meeting. In
<PB N="193" REF="034371_0193_0FFA6C8DA7494428">
my return home, I attended at Long Compton the funeral of a religious young woman, with whom I had been acquainted. It proved a &s;trengthening &s;ea&s;on in Divine love, which freely flowed towards the people.</P>
<P>From Long Compton I went to Chipping-Norton, Eve&s;ham, and Worce&s;ter, &s;taid a few days among&s;t Friends there, and returned home through Eve&s;ham and Alce&s;ter.</P>
<P>I &s;taid about home until the 21&s;t of the Third month, 1761, when I went to the quar|terly meeting at Birmingham; which was com|fortable in a &s;en&s;e of the continued regard of heaven; but &s;orrowful in the apparent de|clen&s;ion of &s;ome profe&s;&s;ing with us from the life of Truth.</P>
<P>From Birmingham I proceeded to the quar|terly meeting for Nottingham&s;hire, held at Mansfield, which was &s;mall, few friends re&s;id|ing in that county. I laboured among them in love, and with &s;trong de&s;ires for their help; and left them in a degree of peace, though not without a doubt of having been rather &s;hort in di&s;charging my duty.</P>
<P>From Mansfield, I went to Che&s;terfield, and had a meeting there, to which came &s;everal from other meetings, and we were favoured together in the Divine pre&s;ence. I then pro|ceeded through &s;ome meetings in York&s;hire, wherein I was &s;trengthened to mini&s;ter, I hope to the &s;atisfaction and comfort of hone&s;t-hearted friends, and to the relief of my own &s;pirit. I came to Lanca&s;ter the 9th of the Fourth
<PB N="194" REF="034371_0194_0FFC2DDEC79CBEE8">
month, in order to attend the quarterly meet|ing there. Thus far on the journey I had tra|velled very hard, and the day before I came to Lanca&s;ter, having met with a very danger|ous fall from my hor&s;e, whereby I hurt one of my arms, &s;o that I was unable to help my|&s;elf, and was otherwi&s;e hurt, it was hard for me to travel; yet I was enabled to proceed forward the next afternoon in a chai&s;e to Ken|dal; and, having attended the quarterly meet|ing there, proceeded to Appleby, to the year|ly meeting for the four northern counties, which began the 12th. I carried my arm in a &s;ling, but in this time of weakne&s;s kind Pro|vidence furni&s;hed me with a &s;uitable compani|on to a&s;&s;i&s;t me, viz. Chri&s;tiana Hird of York|&s;hire, of who&s;e tender care, and affectionate &s;ervices, I retain a grateful &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>The yearly meeting at Appleby was attend|ed by many &s;ober people from the adjacent country, as well as by a large number of the inhabitants of the town; and many of them were con&s;iderably affected by the te&s;timony of Truth; whereto they had been &s;trangers, and many of them had imbibed di&s;agreeable &s;enti|ments re&s;pecting Friends and their principles; but the Lord was plea&s;ed &s;o to manife&s;t his power among&s;t them, that their prejudices were removed, and a confe&s;&s;ion obtained to the truths which were freely preached among them; and Friends left the town rejoicing in the hea|venly Father's love and goodne&s;s, in thus fa|vouring us, and exalting the te&s;timony of
<PB N="195" REF="034371_0195_0FFC2DDC9F615340">
Truth, in a place wherein &s;ome of our wor|thy friends in the beginning of our being a people had &s;uffered &s;o deeply. [See Friends Sufferings by Jo&s;eph Be&s;&s;e.] The 15th, Sa|muel Fothergill and my&s;elf had a meeting at Kirby Steven, which was large and &s;olid, many &s;eeking people around the country at|tending it; and the Lord was plea&s;ed to cau&s;e the go&s;pel trumpet to be &s;ounded clearly and powerfully among them: glory be to his Name for ever!</P>
<P>I went, accompanied by Chri&s;tiana Hird, with the friends from Wen&s;lydale into that quarter; had a meeting at Haws, and the en|&s;uing Fir&s;t-day attended the general meeting at Ay&s;garth, which was very large. A light &s;et of people frequently attending on that time of the year: but the power of Truth was mea&s;urably over their &s;pirits, and I left the place in a good degree of peace. I proceeded in vi&s;iting the meetings in this part of York|&s;hire, and having a view of going almo&s;t di|rectly from that county, to the yearly meeting at London, and being de&s;irous of getting clear of as many meetings therein as I could; I con|tinued to travel hard among the dales. But, my &s;trength being much exhau&s;ted, and &s;ome painful effects of my late fall continuing, when I came to the hou&s;e of my friend William Hird, at Woodhou&s;e (father to my kind com|panion), I re&s;ted for a few days, and was treated with that tenderne&s;s which the &s;tate of my health required. From hence, I went
<PB N="196" REF="034371_0196_0FFC2DD9D12D5E90">
to Gilder&s;ome meeting, where I parted from Chri&s;tiana Hird, in love and &s;ympathy; and went, through &s;everal meetings in York&s;hire, to Nottingham. I &s;taid at Nottingham over Fir&s;t-day, and attended two meetings there. I was weak and much affected with a hoar&s;e|ne&s;s, yet had &s;ome &s;ervice among&s;t Friends there, though not fully to the relief of my mind.</P>
<P>I left Nottingham on the 2d day, and reach|ed London the 7th of the Fifth month. I was favoured with a good degree of peace, and thankfulne&s;s to that good Hand, which had hitherto conducted, and &s;upported me in weakne&s;s.</P>
<P>The yearly meeting was large, and I hope profitable; although I did not think, in the general, that in&s;trumental mini&s;try ro&s;e &s;o high, as it had done in &s;ome of tho&s;e annual &s;olem|nities: but friends were comforted in the im|mediate &s;en&s;e of the continuance of Divine favour, under which they &s;eparated; &s;ome perhaps, to meet no more in time. Our friend Jo&s;eph White, from America, having paid a religious vi&s;it to Friends in this nation, and being about to return home, had a certificate from Friends at this meeting of their unity with his &s;ervices whil&s;t here; and John Ste|phen&s;on and Robert Proud being under an en|gagement of mind to vi&s;it Friends on the continent of America, had certificates for that end.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="034371_0197_0FFC2DD835AE2C18">My &s;pirit rejoiced that I was enabled to at|tend this meeting; and indeed I have &s;eldom or ever attended the yearly meetings in London, without peculiar edification, although &s;ome|times &s;ufferings from various cau&s;es have fallen to my lot: and I am per&s;uaded that if Friends more generally gave them&s;elves up to attend that &s;olemnity; and when there, abode under the &s;ea&s;oning virtue of Truth, they would be better qualified to labour in their &s;everal &s;tati|ons and places of re&s;idence: the weight of &s;ervice devolving upon them there, would be brought home with them, and a more fervent care would remain for maintaining our Chri&s;tian te&s;timony in its various branches, and &s;tretch|ing the line of di&s;cipline over &s;uch among us who walk di&s;orderly.</P>
<P>The week after the yearly meeting I went to Plai&s;tow, and re&s;ted a few days with my friend John Hayward; and, being a little re|cruited, I proceeded, though in diffidence and fear (being often low in body, as well as pre&s;|&s;ed with the weight of the &s;ervice appointed me), to the yearly meetings of Colche&s;ter, Woodbridge, and Norwich: in all of which, through the &s;trengthening hand of Divine mer|cy, I had good &s;ervice.</P>
<P>From Norwich I pa&s;&s;ed, through &s;ome meetings in Lincoln&s;hire and York&s;hire, to the quarterly meeting at York, which was at this time attended by many friends from the &s;everal quarters of it; and &s;ome friends under appointment from the yearly meeting at London, to vi&s;it the monthly
<PB N="198" REF="034371_0198_0FFC2DD6163030E8">
and quarterly meetings of Friends, were there; and, I hope, were &s;erviceable, in inquiring in|to the general &s;tate of Friends, exciting them to various duties, and endeavouring to &s;trength|en the hedge of di&s;cipline.</P>
<P>From this meeting I proceeded, accompanied by Rachel Wil&s;on and Margaret Raine, to Leeds and Bradford, and &s;o to a large general meeting held annually in a barn at Bingley. It was in a good degree &s;atisfactory, many go&s;pel Truths being opened to the people; who be|haved &s;oberly, and many of them &s;eemed well affected towards Friends. After this meeting I proceeded towards the quarterly meeting at Lanca&s;ter, and from that place, accompanied by my friends Jonathan Raine and wife and Alex|ander Parkin&s;on, I went to Turton near Bolton, where &s;everal young men and others were un|der convincement. Several friends met us here, and we had a favoured meeting with them and many of their neighbours; rejoicing in the hope, that the Shepherd of I&s;rael would gather to him|&s;elf a people in that country. There are none under our name near them, which rendered the breaking forth of Truth among&s;t them a more &s;ignal in&s;tance of the immediate efficacy of its Divine power. May they be pre&s;erved humble, and dependent on that Hand, which alone can build up, and "e&s;tabli&s;h on the mo&s;t holy faith."</P>
<P>From Turton I went with my friend Jona|than Raine and wife to their hou&s;e near Ro&s;|&s;endale, and attended a large general meeting there the next day; and proceeded to Man|che&s;ter
<PB N="199" REF="034371_0199_0FFC2DD3EEC38EC0">
on Second-day, and had a meeting there that evening. On Third-day, accompanied by two men friends, I travelled hard; and in the evening we mi&s;&s;ed our way over a moor, which rendered it late in the night when we came to John Draycoat's in Derby&s;hire. I had a fall from my mare, through her mi&s;&s;ing her &s;tep upon a narrow cau&s;eway, but through mercy was pre&s;erved from hurt. Next day I had a meeting at Furnace, and afterwards rode to Burton upon Trent, and the en&s;uing day to Pole&s;worth, in order to attend the marriage of my cou&s;ins John Wilkins and Elizabeth Ly|thall, which was &s;olemnized at Bad&s;ley the next day, and we were favoured together with the Lord's pre&s;ence: ble&s;&s;ed be his holy name! The next day, being the 20th of the Seventh month I reached home, where I found my dear mother as well as could be expected for her age, but my brother yet poorly. I had now at &s;everal times vi&s;ited Friends in York|&s;hire pretty generally; and had con&s;iderable &s;ervice among&s;t people not profe&s;&s;ing with them. After this journey my mind &s;ettled in peace and thankfulne&s;s, having to look back upon it with deep gratitude to the Divine hand, whereby I had been conducted, &s;upported, and encouraged to pre&s;s forward, although under con&s;iderable bodily weakne&s;s, and &s;ome fears on account of the &s;ituation of my dear mother, &amp;c. But as my eye was pre|&s;erved &s;ingle to the Lord's &s;ervice, he cared for tho&s;e I had left for his name's &s;ake, and
<PB N="200" REF="034371_0200_0FFC304BA41C9D18">
brought me home in a better &s;tate of health than I had left it, notwith&s;tanding I had tra|velled and laboured exceedingly hard; having in fifteen weeks attended 117 meetings, and travelled about 1230 miles; nearly the whole on hor&s;eback.</P>
<P>The beginning of the Eighth month, I at|tended the Circular yearly meeting, which was held at Bromyard in Hereford&s;hire. It was not &s;o large, either of Friends or people of other &s;ocieties, as of late years had been u&s;ual, nor did the life of Truth in the mini&s;try ri&s;e to the height I have known it; yet, upon the whole, Friends had cau&s;e to be thankful for the opportunity.</P>
<P>From this meeting I went to &s;pend a day or two with my dear &s;i&s;ter Young at Leomin&s;ter, which I e&s;teemed a great favour, as it was the la&s;t time we &s;pent together, except near her la&s;t moments. She was &s;eized in the Tenth month following with an indi&s;po&s;ition, which terminated in a violent inflammatory fever. Her hu&s;band was then in the we&s;t of England, in company with &s;ome friends, on a religious vi&s;it to the monthly and quarterly meetings of Friends in that part of the nation. A me&s;&s;enger being &s;ent to inform us of her illne&s;s, I went to her; and was favoured to find her &s;o &s;en&s;ible as to inform me that &s;he was very ea&s;y in mind: &s;oon after which &s;he grew delirious, and her &s;en&s;es were never more quite clear; yet &s;he once intimated that &s;he was quiet, and hoped &s;he had a quiet habitation.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="034371_0201_0FFA6C9B8FB6D3C0">She was a truly valuable woman, and doubt|le&s;s her &s;pirit entered into re&s;t. She died at the age of forty-five, after a life attended with various trials. The lo&s;s to her family, her other relations, friends, and neighbours, was great; and the &s;orrow for it among&s;t all who were acquainted with her was general: yet under a &s;en&s;e that our lo&s;s was her great gain, it was mixed with joy in the hearts of her neare&s;t relations and friends.</P>
<P>She left three children, and her &s;orrowful and very affectionate hu&s;band; who, after he had information of her dangerous &s;tate, tra|velled hard to get home, but did not reach it until after her corps was interred. My bro|ther &s;taid at Leomin&s;ter until he came thither, and I returned home to my dear mother, and my &s;i&s;ter's elde&s;t daughter, who was then at Dudley, a thoughtful child of about eleven years of age, who had a very great affection for her mother. I found them full as well as I expected, con&s;idering my mother's great love for my &s;i&s;ter, who had been an extraordinary child to her; &s;teadily &s;ympathizing with, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting her in her afflictions, when &s;he had no other child that was &s;o capable of doing it. But &s;he was favoured with &s;ignal re&s;ignation to the Divine will, which is doubtle&s;s right in taking away, as well as in giving.</P>
<P>My &s;pirits had been &s;upported beyond my expectation through this trial, although my health appeared &s;haken by the fatigue attend|ing it; yet in le&s;s than two weeks, I &s;et out
<PB N="202" REF="034371_0202_0FFA6C9E364B3738">
for Bloxham to attend my &s;i&s;ter Summerfield, who was now my only &s;urviving &s;i&s;ter. I at|tended Warwick meeting in my way; and in the evening appointed one for the neighbours, which was large, and crowned with Divine life and power, for which I was truly thankful. After about two weeks &s;tay I went for London, having before I left home a certificate to vi&s;it Friends in that city. I had &s;everal meetings in my way thither among&s;t people not profe&s;&s;ing with us, to &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>I &s;taid rather more than a month in London, and through diligent labour, and con&s;iderable travail of &s;pirit, left it ea&s;y in mind, and re|turned home by my &s;i&s;ter's.</P>
<P>The day I left her hou&s;e the wind was very high. I rode double, and when we came to the high uninclo&s;ed field-lands, nearly upon a level with the &s;ummit of Edge hill, it was &s;o extremely boi&s;terous, that my&s;elf and the man who rode before me, concluded it &s;afe&s;t to alight; which we did, under &s;helter of a &s;hort thorn-hedge, probably planted to afford &s;hel|ter to &s;heep. We &s;aw a village, but had to cro&s;s the field to it. The man held the hor&s;e by one hand, and I held by his other arm; but the wind was &s;o violently &s;trong, that he rather dragged than led me, for I &s;tooped very low, being unable to &s;tand again&s;t it. I think it rained al&s;o while we cro&s;&s;ed the field. We got to a poor hou&s;e of entertain|ment, the covering of a building belonging to which was &s;tripped off a little before we came;
<PB N="203" REF="034371_0203_0FFC304A191EF050">
and we &s;taid in it, not without fear, until the violence of the wind abated; which it did in the afternoon, and we reached Eatington the &s;ame night. I think this was the wind of which it was &s;aid, that none had been &s;o high &s;ince Eddy&s;tone light-hou&s;e was blown down; and our getting through it without hurt ap|peared providential. It was a hurricane in the morning, yet it was tolerably calm in the evening.</P>
<P>I got home the 15th of the Fir&s;t month, 1762, in a better &s;tate of health than I left it, and was comforted to find our family tolerably well; and I had great cau&s;e for thankfulne&s;s, for the many mercies and pre&s;ervations vouch|&s;afed in this journey.</P>
<P>In the &s;pring of this year I attended the northern and Welch yearly meetings; the fir&s;t held at Bolton in Lanca&s;hire, and that for Wales at Bala in Merioneth&s;hire. That at Bolton was very large, and attended by many valuable mini&s;ters and friends, and a great number of &s;ober inquiring people of other &s;ocieties; among&s;t whom the go&s;pel-trumpet was &s;ounded in Divine authority, to the com|fort of faithful friends, and, I hope, to the in&s;truction and awakening of many &s;ouls. In my way from Bolton to Bala, in company with my friend Samuel Fothergill, I attended the meeting at Che&s;ter on the Fir&s;t-day morning; whereto many &s;oberly behaved people of the town came, and we were favoured with a com|fortable tendering opportunity together. From
<PB N="204" REF="034371_0204_0FFC3047F0765770">
Che&s;ter we proceeded to Bala, in company with I&s;abella Middleton, a mini&s;tering friend from Ireland, and overtook Rachel Wil&s;on and Chri&s;tiana Hird, before we got thither.</P>
<P>The meeting at Bala was large, con&s;idering the part of the country it was held in: the people behaved &s;oberly, and many of them were affected by the heart-tendering power of Truth. We had a comfortable opportunity with a few that came in love to bid us farewel; and left the place, in full a&s;&s;urance of the ex|tendings of Divine love to the inhabitants of this poor part of the nation, and thankfulne&s;s that we were accounted worthy to preach the go&s;pel to them. I returned home by Coal|brookdale, and on the Fir&s;t-day was at a very large meeting at the New Dale, wherein the Lord's power was exalted: ble&s;&s;ed be his name for ever!</P>
<P>I reached home the 4th of the Fifth month, and found my mother and brother well as u&s;ual, but my brother Henry (my father's &s;on by a former wife) unwell, with a di&s;order in his right leg; which terminated in a mortification, and in &s;omething more than eight weeks his leg was taken off. Our affliction through this circum&s;tance was con&s;iderable; for be&s;ides the care for his natural life, which was imminent|ly in danger, our concern for his immortal &s;oul was great. For having addicted him&s;elf to plea&s;ure and to the gratification of his natural appetites, he had lo&s;t the &s;implicity of his edu|cation; and, becau&s;e he would indulge him|&s;elf
<PB N="205" REF="034371_0205_0FFC3045C64B7EF8">
in liberties which he knew were incon&s;i&s;tent with the profe&s;&s;ion of Truth, he threw it off; &s;aying, he would not retain the name and be a reproach to the people. He &s;ometimes went to the church of England, not, as he &s;aid, from principle, but becau&s;e he would go &s;ome|where. When a youth, he was much hum|bled under the vi&s;itation of Divine love; but when he arrived to mature age, he was drawn a&s;ide by vain company.</P>
<P>In this affliction he was favoured with a re|newed vi&s;itation of heavenly favour; under which he lamented his lo&s;s and fall, and re|marked
<Q>that it had been through keeping company, and not that which is accounted the wor&s;t of company neither.</Q>
He had a long time allowed him to repent, and in the fore part of his illne&s;s was penitent and much exerci&s;ed in mind; but being flattered with the hopes of life after his leg was cut off, his thoughts appeared then to be too much occupi|ed with its pro&s;pects, although not without &s;ome propo&s;ition of a reformation of conduct, if his health &s;hould be re&s;tored.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation I was obliged to leave him, being engaged to attend the Circular yearly meeting, which was held this year at Exeter. My &s;i&s;ter &s;upplied my place in the family, and I went pretty directly to it, attending the quar|terly meeting at Glouce&s;ter, and two other meetings, in my way, the Lord's power ac|companying me.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="034371_0206_0FFC3043872BD0C0">The meeting at Exeter was much le&s;s than &s;ome of the like kind had been; but was at|tended by &s;ome &s;ober people, and by &s;ome high profe&s;&s;ors of religion, who&s;e foundations were &s;truck at in the power of Truth, the te&s;timony whereof was mea&s;urably exalted. The &s;tate of the members of our own &s;ociety was mini&s;tered to; in &s;ome in&s;tances it was la|mentable, and tended greatly to le&s;&s;en the weight of the te&s;timony of Truth, which had been at this time borne in the demon&s;tration of its own &s;pirit.</P>
<P>I proceeded from Exeter to the quarterly meeting in Somer&s;et&s;hire, which was eminently crowned with Divine favour; and I parted from Friends there in the comfortable &s;en&s;e of go&s;pel fellow&s;hip, and returned to Bri&s;tol, having &s;everal large and &s;atisfactory meetings in the way thither.</P>
<P>I &s;pent a few days in Bri&s;tol, I hope profita|bly, having a renewed cau&s;e to believe that the Divine life was revived in &s;ome in that city, although too many had fallen a&s;leep as in the lap of this world.</P>
<P>From Bri&s;tol I went to the quarterly meet|ing for Hereford&s;hire, held at Ro&s;s, and &s;o to Leomin&s;ter; where I &s;pent more than a week in my brother Young's family, not idly, but caring for it; and returned home to the mutu|al &s;atisfaction of my&s;elf and my relations there.</P>
<P>I found my dear mother and brother tolera|bly well, and my poor brother Henry appear|ed in &s;ome re&s;pects better, yet at times &s;o
<PB N="207" REF="034371_0207_0FFC304154296850">
languid, that I doubted his continuing long in time. My fears proved well founded, for his deplorable di&s;order &s;eized his other foot, and on the 15th of the Twelfth month, 1762, he died; having endured a long &s;cene of inex|pre&s;&s;ible pain and affliction. Agreeably to his own de&s;ire, his corps was interred in Friends' burying ground. He was endowed with a good under&s;tanding and an engaging natural di&s;po&s;ition, and his per&s;on and manners were &s;uperior to many. He was in his fifty-&s;eventh year.</P>
<P>I think it worthy commemoration, that &s;ome time before he was &s;eized with the di&s;order which terminated his life, I had been earne&s;tly &s;olicitous that the Lord would bring him to a &s;en&s;e of his apo&s;tatized &s;tate before he was ta|ken out of time; and con&s;train him to con|demn that libertine &s;pirit wherein he had &s;o long indulged; that his a&s;&s;ociates might not have cau&s;e &s;o to triumph as to invalidate the Chri&s;tian te&s;timonies. The&s;e my de&s;ires were &s;ignally an&s;wered.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the occurrences related in the clo&s;e of the foregoing Chapter, until after I entered into a marriage &s;tate, I made no mi|nutes of my religious labours, although I was as con&s;tantly engaged as heretofore, in attend|ing yearly and quarterly meetings, &amp;c. in di|vers parts of the nation, vi&s;iting particular meetings of Friends, as well as appointing &s;ome for people of other &s;ocieties; and in the winters, I mo&s;tly &s;pent &s;ome time in London. Yet &s;o few remarkable incidents occurred, that, my movements appeared &s;carcely worth noting; except that the Lord's hand was re|vealed for my help and pre&s;ervation, through which I was enabled to &s;u&s;tain almo&s;t uninter|rupted, though varied, fatigue and exerci&s;e, both of body and mind. After my &s;i&s;ter Ann's marriage, a load of dome&s;tick concerns devolv|ed upon me. Through my mother's very great age, and my brother's frequent indi&s;po|&s;ition, my times of re&s;pite from travelling and go&s;pel-labours were far from being &s;ea&s;ons of re&s;t. A &s;hort time before I married, my left elbow was di&s;located by a fall down &s;tairs, and reduced with con&s;iderable difficulty. As that
<PB N="209" REF="034371_0209_0FFC303CE22D5038">
joint from my infancy had been weak, and had &s;everal times been hurt by falls from my hor&s;e, as is before related, it became from this time &s;o weak, as to render my riding &s;ingle impro|per, and riding double was rather dangerous, as I could not help my&s;elf on hor&s;e-back with|out my arm; I had therefore cau&s;e to be thankful that my expected new &s;tation would furni&s;h me with a chai&s;e.</P>
<P>For the fulfilling of every purpo&s;e of Divine wi&s;dom there is a particular &s;ea&s;on; and al|though I married rather late in life, the con|nection from its beginning was attended with &s;uch &s;ingular circum&s;tances, as marked its be|ing &s;uperior to nature, although nature had its &s;hare in it; and the re&s;trictions laid upon my mind, and that of my beloved hu&s;band, were too remarkable to be omitted in the memoirs of the &s;ignally providential occurrences of my life.</P>
<P>I have already noted the meeting with Wil|liam Phillips in 1749, at Swan&s;ea, (&s;ee page 24). Before that time we were entire &s;trangers to each other, I do not recollect that I had ever heard of him. My mind had been, and was un|der &s;trong re&s;trictions in regard to entering into the marriage &s;tate, &s;hould I be &s;olicited thereto; for as it appeared that for a &s;eries of years I &s;hould be much engaged in travelling for the &s;er|vice of Truth, I feared to indulge thoughts of forming a connection, which, from its incum|brances, might tend to fru&s;trate the inten|tion of Divine wi&s;dom re&s;pecting me. This caution tended to keep me re&s;erved in my con|duct,
<PB N="210" REF="034371_0210_0FFA6C97B6E004F8">
towards &s;uch as might be likely to enter|tain views beyond friend&s;hip, in their acquain|tance with me; and my mind, to the time of our meeting, had been &s;o pre&s;erved, as never to ad|mit the lea&s;t impre&s;&s;ion of affection beyond that &s;ine, with any one.</P>
<P>William Phillips was then a widower, and had two young children. His worldly circum|&s;tances I was unacquainted with, further than that I then learned the place of his re&s;idence, and &s;omewhat of his bu&s;ine&s;s, which was, in part, that of an agent to a copper-company. He was con&s;iderably older than my&s;elf. So that none of the&s;e circum&s;tances could of them&s;elves make a connection with him de&s;irable. For as to his employ, which might &s;eem the lea&s;t ex|ceptionable, it was le&s;s plea&s;ing to me than would have been his being his own free man. It was therefore improbable that temporal con&s;i|derations &s;hould bias my mind in his favour; and as to his religious experience, it appeared to be but in its infancy. He had indeed, a frank and open di&s;po&s;ition, which, joined to a good under&s;tanding, rendered his conver&s;ation agree|able; but I had but little opportunity to judge of this, before it appeared that perhaps we might one day unite in the marriage covenant.</P>
<P>Upon ob&s;erving him &s;trictly, I had the &s;atis|faction to &s;ee that his mind was &s;u&s;ceptible of the be&s;t impre&s;&s;ions, and bending out of the world, wherein, in &s;ome parts of his conduct, he had taken too great a part. His behaviour to me was prudently re&s;tricted, though he after|wards
<PB N="211" REF="034371_0211_0FFC303AAECEDD48">
confe&s;&s;ed that his mind was affectionately di&s;po&s;ed towards me. We were favoured toge|ther, e&s;pecially in one meeting, with the uniting influence of Divine love, but parted merely as common friends. Very &s;oon after, a circum|&s;tance happened, which, without the lea&s;t de&s;ign on either &s;ide, nece&s;&s;arily introduced a corre&s;|pondence by letters between us; and we ex|changed &s;everal in re&s;tricted terms, &s;uited to our &s;ituations.</P>
<P>In my next journey to the we&s;tern counties, I had meetings in &s;ome towns where none were e&s;tabli&s;hed, particularly at Redruth and Truro in Cornwall, at both of which William Phillips was very &s;erviceable; and his &s;pirit being dip|ped into &s;ympathy with me in my &s;ervice, and mine, with him under his religious exerci&s;es, it tended to &s;trengthen the regard we had for each other; yet &s;uch was the re&s;triction we were pre&s;erved under, that no &s;entiment tran&s;|pired, nor was there any, the lea&s;t part of his conduct, more than was con&s;i&s;tent with a di&s;tin|gui&s;hed friend&s;hip: and thus we again parted, and continued our religious corre&s;pondence. But my mind becoming doubtful whether I had &s;uch an evidence that our intimacy would ever ri&s;e higher than friend&s;hip, as to warrant my retaining the pro&s;pect of it; and ruminating upon the injurious con&s;equences which might en|&s;ue to us both, &s;hould our affections be engaged contrary to the Divine will; and that, perhaps, the continuing an intimacy with me might pre|vent his mind from &s;ettling upon &s;ome other
<PB N="212" REF="034371_0212_0FFC3037EC62E658">
per&s;on, who might be a &s;uitable companion for him through life; and &s;eeing clearly, that my religious pro&s;pects would not for a long time admit of my changing my &s;ituation; I conclud|ed it &s;afe&s;t to relinqui&s;h our corre&s;pondence, and to leave the event of the foundation of affecti|on which was laid, to future time: hoping, that if Divine wi&s;dom de&s;igned a nearer union be|twixt us, he would prepare my friend to be a &s;uitable helpmate for me. My fear of erring on this occa&s;ion was proportioned to that &s;uperior love, which bound me to the &s;ervice appointed me; in the pur&s;uit whereof, I was de&s;irous to relinqui&s;h every pro&s;pect and connection which might retard my fulfilling it: and I continued clo&s;ely engaged in it for many years, and kept an entire di&s;tance from my friend.</P>
<P>In this time our minds became &s;o relea&s;ed from each other, as to be at liberty to entertain other pro&s;pects of marriage; and but for the interpo|&s;ition of a watchful Providence, we might each of us have been engaged to our hurt. But however promi&s;ing the pro&s;pect might be to my mind, I never was favoured with true peace, in looking to a marriage connection with any other; and as to my friend, although he had en|tirely lo&s;t the hope of a nearer union with me, however thoughtful he might be re&s;pecting its being convenient for him to change his &s;ituati|on, he did not find freedom to propo&s;e it to any other woman. Thus we continued &s;epa|rated, and &s;eparately exerci&s;ed; I in clo&s;e ap|plication to publick &s;ervice; and he in his
<PB N="213" REF="034371_0213_0FFC3035B613E710">
worldly engagements, and under various temptations and conflicts, inwardly and out|wardly, which called for the &s;ympathy of a friend; when none was afforded, &s;ave that of the never-failing Helper, by who&s;e hand his head was &s;u&s;tained, and he witne&s;&s;ed pre&s;erva|tion even as from the
<Q>paw of the lion and bear.</Q></P>
<P>In the year 1766, I attended the Circular meeting, and vi&s;ited mo&s;t of the meetings of Friends in Cornwall. Previou&s;ly to my taking that journey, I had an intimation in my mind, which &s;eemed to point towards a revival of our intimacy. This happened at a time when I was quite free from impre&s;&s;ions of natural af|fection towards W. Phillips; for I was deep|ly engaged in thoughtfulne&s;s re&s;pecting another friend, and humbly and earne&s;tly de&s;irous to be informed whether I might &s;afely remove to the place of his re&s;idence.</P>
<P>Under this exerci&s;e, my mind was turned with uncommon force to Cornwall; and the name of the place where W. Phillips re&s;ided was revived with &s;uch &s;trength, that it was as if vocally &s;poken in my &s;oul. At the &s;ame time I was favoured with the &s;weet &s;en&s;ation of Divine love and life. And although the re|moving to this poor county afforded no plea&s;ing view, I was willing to &s;ubmit, if Divine wi&s;|dom appointed it; but as to W. Phillips, I doubted his having advanced in religion, &s;o as to render a nearer union with him &s;afe; but I
<PB N="214" REF="034371_0214_0FFC30342AB9C268">
could only judge &s;uperficially, the exerci&s;ed &s;tate of his mind being hid from me.</P>
<P>Hannah Shipley, of Uttoxeter in Stafford|&s;hire, was my companion in this journey, who&s;e affectionate attention to me, I remember with gratitude: her &s;ervice al&s;o in the mini&s;try was acceptable to friends.</P>
<P>When we came into Cornwall, I was cauti|ous of giving heed to the before-mentioned in|timation; and when I met W. Phillips, was de&s;irous to be favoured with a &s;en&s;e of the &s;tate of his &s;pirit; and was thankful to find it bend|ing towards the &s;pring of Divine life, beyond my expectation. We were frequently toge|ther, while I was in the county; but never a|lone, &s;o as at all to enter into conver&s;ation on the &s;ubject of our former corre&s;pondence, ex|cept when riding on the high road; when, one day, he mentioned the trial it was to him that I &s;hould &s;o abruptly drop it; and &s;aid he had cautiou&s;ly avoided a conduct which might give me umbrage; and added, that he had never admitted a &s;entiment of di&s;plea&s;ure at me on the occa&s;ion, as he concluded that I had &s;ome rea&s;on for &s;o doing, which was of &s;uffici|ent weight to my&s;elf: but if my being in a &s;ingle &s;tation were the cau&s;e, I needed not to have feared him, for although he loved me, hitherto his mind had been under a re&s;triction from endeavouring to pa&s;s the bounds of friend|&s;hip. This was &s;aying more than he had ever done before; but during his being with me in
<PB N="215" REF="034371_0215_0FFC303163E79EB0">
this journey, his behaviour was &s;trictly con&s;i&s;t|ent with friend&s;hip only.</P>
<P>One circum&s;tance I think worthy of relating, as it di&s;covered both his &s;ympathy with my re|ligious engagements, and how Divine wi&s;dom works to the effecting his own purpo&s;es. Af|ter I left Plymouth, in my way into Cornwall, it appeared that I &s;hould have a meeting at Plymouth Dock in my return. This I inti|mated to a friend of Plymouth then with me, and de&s;ired him to inquire whether a proper place could be procured. This friend, and another from Plymouth, met me at the Circu|lar yearly meeting, which was held at Bodmin, at which al&s;o was W. Phillips.</P>
<P>They gave me no encouragement of getting a meeting at Dock; indeed it was looked up|on improbable that a place large enough for the people could be procured there; &s;o they pro|po&s;ed that a meeting &s;hould be appointed at Friends meeting-hou&s;e at Plymouth, and that the people of Dock &s;hould be invited thereto. This did not &s;eem to promi&s;e relief to my mind; for be&s;ides the Dock's being three miles di&s;tant, the hou&s;e might probably have been too &s;mall for the Plymouth people and them. My concern for the Dock continued, but I &s;aid little about it, except hinting it to my brother, who, with divers friends out of Worce&s;ter&s;hire was at Bodmin. In the night before I left that place it pre&s;&s;ed weightily upon my mind; but I could &s;ee no way to obtain a meeting, unle&s;s
<PB N="216" REF="034371_0216_0FFC302F33EF5D48">
W. Phillips would accompany me; who I knew had re&s;olution enough to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the un|dertaking. He de&s;igned going homeward the next day, and I was reluctant to propo&s;e his going with us to Plymouth; but de&s;ired, if my exerci&s;e for Dock was from the Lord, and it was right for him to a&s;&s;i&s;t me therein, that it might be impre&s;&s;ed on his mind to go. Af|ter this, my &s;pirit was relieved, and in the morning I heard W. Phillips &s;ay to the friends, I mu&s;t go to Plymouth, giving as a rea&s;on, that he had an uncle there who was unwell. He afterwards told me, this was the only rea|&s;on he could a&s;&s;ign for his mind being forcibly drawn to Plymouth, which it was before he aro&s;e; and when at breakfa&s;t he heard me in|quiring whether a place could be procured at Dock to hold a meeting, he &s;aw the cau&s;e of his being drawn to Plymouth, and im|mediately replied, There is no doubt of it. In our way to Plymouth, we had a large &s;atisfactory meeting in the market-hou&s;e at Li&s;keard. At Dock, my brother, friends from Worce&s;ter&s;hire, and W. Phillips, obtain|ed a large &s;chool-room; which opened into a &s;quare. A window was taken out, and I &s;tood in that, &s;o as to &s;peak to the people with|out; and the hou&s;e being full within, I believe all might hear, though there was a great con|cour&s;e of people. It was a favoured opportu|nity, at which the friends who accompanied me for the promoting of it were very &s;erviceable;
<PB N="217" REF="034371_0217_0FFC302DA9146350">
but had not W. Phillips a&s;&s;i&s;ted them, it did not appear probable that &s;o large a meeting would have been procured, and held &s;o quiet|ly: he was peculiarly fitted for &s;uch &s;ervices.</P>
<P>After my return home, our corre&s;pondence by letter revived; but although it &s;oon pa&s;&s;ed the bounds of mere friend&s;hip, our minds were clothed with awful caution of &s;tepping forward without Divine direction. For &s;ome years we &s;aw each other but &s;eldom, and that only as we met in the cour&s;e of my &s;ervice; and not|with&s;tanding a nearer union was from time to time pointed out, yet our way not opening clearly to the accompli&s;hment of it, we did not marry until the 15th of Seventh month, 1772; when, in a large and &s;olemn meeting held at Bewdley, we took each other in the real fear of the Lord, and therein had a &s;trong evidence of his favour. Many of my friends from the adjacent meetings met us upon the occa&s;ion; unto whom my &s;pirit was drawn forth in the be&s;t love; wherein, after we had taken each other in marriage, I was led to advi&s;e, cauti|on, and encourage them.</P>
<P>The parting from my dear mother had been an affecting circum&s;tance, but it was a great &s;a|tisfaction to me, that, although her faculties were breaking, &s;he was &s;en&s;ible I was removed from her in Divine wi&s;dom. The morning I left her, &s;he took a quiet &s;teady farewel of me, and told me &s;he was &s;atisfied Providence had provided for me, unto who&s;e will &s;he was re|&s;igned. As my brother propo&s;ed accompany|ing
<PB N="218" REF="034371_0218_0FFC302B39FA8398">
me home, my &s;i&s;ter Sommerfield &s;taid with our mother in his ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>After our marriage at Bewdley, we proceed|ed on our way to my brother Young's at Le|omin&s;ter, where we &s;taid &s;ome days, and then went to Swan&s;ea, my brother, and niece A. Young, accompanying us. In our way to Swan&s;ea, we had a meeting at Hereford, and another near Talgarth in Wales, where the Counte&s;s of Huntingdon had e&s;tabli&s;hed a col|lege for the education of young men for the mini&s;try. Some of them came to the meeting, and &s;everal behaved rather lightly; but one &s;ought an opportunity with us afterwards, and freely expre&s;&s;ed his unea&s;ine&s;s in his pre|&s;ent &s;ituation, and de&s;ired to get among&s;t Friends. He reque&s;ted my hu&s;band's a&s;&s;i&s;tance to procure him a &s;uitable place; but though one pretty &s;oon offered, and he was informed of it, he declined accepting it. Many are &s;haken by the power of Truth, but few are &s;teadily concerned to build upon its foundation: and therefore it may with &s;orrow be &s;aid, "Many are called, but few cho&s;en." We had al&s;o a meeting at Llandilo, which, though not very large, was &s;atisfactory.</P>
<P>We &s;taid at Swan&s;ea &s;ome weeks, the wind being contrary for our going down the Chan|nel. During our &s;tay there, the Fir&s;t and week-day meetings were mo&s;tly large and fa|voured. A particular vi&s;itation of Truth was extended to &s;ome who had gone out from
<PB N="219" REF="034371_0219_0FFC3028CEF116A8">
Friends by marriage and otherwi&s;e, who were affectionately entreated, and warned of their danger in trifling with the day of their vi&s;itati|on, which was ha&s;tening fa&s;t to a conclu&s;ion. Several of the&s;e were much affected, and two of them &s;oon fini&s;hed their cour&s;e. I have ad|mired the mercy of God, even to the back|&s;liders and revolters from us; from few of whom the witne&s;s of Truth is &s;o withdrawn, but that they will confe&s;s to it; and many to the latter &s;tage of life are followed with clo&s;e convictions, and tender calls to return to the heavenly Father's hou&s;e, and yet continue in a country far remote from it: having &s;o con|nected them&s;elves with tho&s;e who are in the &s;pirit of this world, as to conclude it impo&s;&s;ible to break loo&s;e from them. But, although through inattention to the holy principle of light and grace, they may have rendered their way very difficult, and mingled for them&s;elves a bitter cup; yet if they would attend to that Divine love which draws them, they would experience its power to relea&s;e their &s;pirits from the power of Satan, and bring them into
<Q>the glorious liberty of the children of God.</Q></P>
<P>I vi&s;ited the families of tho&s;e profe&s;&s;ing Truth in Swan&s;ea; but the time for holding the Cir|cular meeting for the we&s;tern counties ap|proaching, and it being to be held this year in Cornwall, my hu&s;band was earne&s;t to get
<PB N="220" REF="034371_0220_0FFC3025D81B3BF0">
home. Another meeting, al&s;o, which was u&s;ual|ly very large, held annually near his habitation, engaged our attention; therefore, the wind not &s;erving for us to go to Cornwall, we cro&s;&s;|ed the Channel to lifracomb in Devon&s;hire, and through Divine favour landed &s;afe, though not without &s;ome danger; and proceeded di|rectly home to Redruth. The Fir&s;t-day af|ter we reached it, we attended the before-men|tioned meeting at Key, at which it was &s;up|po&s;ed there were 1500 people: it was held without doors, and was a favoured opportuni|ty. The next week came on the Circular yearly meeting, which was held at Hel&s;ton, was extremely large, and well attended by friends; and in divers meetings the te&s;timony of Truth was exalted through &s;everal of the Lord's cho&s;en &s;ervants. I was largely and livingly opened in his &s;ervice, by him who alone can qualify for it: to whom I ever de&s;ire to a&s;cribe the prai&s;e.</P>
<P>For &s;ome time after I came home, a pretty many &s;erious people attended our meetings, and doctrine &s;uitable to their &s;tates was opened; but mo&s;t of them were too much under the in|fluence of human teachers to receive the Truth in its &s;implicity, and walk by its light. I quick|ly found a concern to appoint a meeting at the place called St. Agnes, a town on the north &s;ea coa&s;t. Near this place the people were ad|dicted to the barbarous cu&s;tom of plundering
<PB N="221" REF="034371_0221_0FFC3023B1078380">
ve&s;&s;els wrecked upon the coa&s;t. Abundance of people collected, &s;o that we were obliged to hold the meeting in the &s;treet, which was a re|markably quiet &s;olemn opportunity. Many of the wreckers were &s;uppo&s;ed to be pre&s;ent, and I had to reprove the practice very clo&s;ely; which might be &s;uppo&s;ed to have pre&s;ent effect, for the people exerted them&s;elves to &s;ave the cargo of the next ve&s;&s;el that was wrecked.</P>
<P>In a few weeks after the Circular meeting, I went to the quarterly meeting for Devon|&s;hire, held at King&s;bridge, and thence took a turn into the north of the county, accompanied by William Cookworthy and &s;everal other friends. We appointed meetings in &s;everal places where none were &s;ettled, in all of which, except at Great Torrington, we had good &s;atisfaction; and there we had rea&s;on to con|clude that we appointed the meeting at too late an hour, through conde&s;cen&s;ion to &s;ome who expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire to attend it, and could not come &s;ooner. It was Fir&s;t-day, and the even|ing coming on, a crowd of di&s;orderly people impeded the &s;ervice; and my mind was the more pained, becau&s;e an earlier hour had been pointed to me for holding the meeting. We had a good meeting in the town-hall at Laun|ce&s;ton, after which William Cookworthy went homewards, and I to Wadebridge. I had a meeting there to &s;atisfaction, and returned home, under the per&s;ua&s;ion of having been engaged in the di&s;charge of my duty, and a&s;|&s;i&s;ted
<PB N="222" REF="034371_0222_0FFC30221DB489B8">
by Divine grace in the performance there|of.</P>
<P>I &s;taid at and about home until near the time of the yearly meeting at Bri&s;tol, 1773, which I attended; and thence, accompanied by my dear friend Lydia Hawk&s;worth, went to that in London. We vi&s;ited the meeting of Friends in Hamp&s;hire in our way, and I returned into Cornwall to our quarterly meeting held at Looe in the Seventh month; where my hu&s;|band met me, and we went together to that for Devon&s;hire, held at Plymouth.</P>
<P>The annual meeting at Key was this year large and &s;atisfactory; after which I went to vi&s;it my aged parent and other relations, and attend the Circular yearly meeting at Glou|ce&s;ter. I vi&s;ited the meetings of Friends, as I went along, who were truly glad to &s;ee me, and we were favoured together with the &s;weet influence of Divine love and life. The Cir|cular yearly meeting was very large both of Friends and other profe&s;&s;ors of religion, and was much favoured through the mini&s;try. The &s;elect meeting for Friends was a memorable op|portunity. Plentiful are the &s;howers of go&s;|pel rain which often fall upon the&s;e occa&s;ions; but in regard to many minds vi&s;ited, it is like water &s;pilled upon a &s;tone, which, though it wet its &s;urface, doth not change its nature; but in others, I hope it is like "Bread ca&s;t upon the waters," a very un&s;table element, yet it "may return after many days!"</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="034371_0223_0FFC301FEB35B4E0">From this meeting I returned home with my friend Sarah Tregelles. In my way I had two large meetings at South Molton to good &s;atis|faction. There are none profe&s;&s;ing with us in that town; but &s;ome friends from Exeter ac|companied us, and others under convincement from the north of Devon&s;hire met us here. I returned home to our quarterly meeting at Penzance, and was thankfully received by my dear hu&s;band, who&s;e great affection rendered it hard for him to be &s;o frequently &s;eparated from me, but in re&s;ignation to the Divine will he was favoured with peace.</P>
<P>In the Fir&s;t month 1774, I had a &s;atisfac|tory meeting at Hel&s;ton, in the town-hall. The weather was wet, and the &s;eat whereon I &s;at was very damp, but on the evening after the meeting I did not find I had taken any cold. Next morning I was well as u&s;ual, but &s;ud|denly, I found my&s;elf much indi&s;po&s;ed, and was &s;eized with convul&s;ions in my head. This alarmed my hu&s;band, who called upon an apo|thecary, and I quickly got better, and we went home, where the di&s;order returned. In a few days however I appeared to be much better, but I quickly relap&s;ed; and in a few weeks was reduced to a &s;tate of extreme weak|ne&s;s. My affliction in this time of indi&s;po&s;ition was very great, but I was pre&s;erved in pati|ence, and when I revived a little, wrote as follows.</P>
<P>'I am now reviving from bodily weakne&s;s. O! that it may be with renewed &s;trength to
<PB N="224" REF="034371_0224_0FFC301DBB94CEC0">
&s;erve the bounteous Author of my being and ble&s;&s;ings, who bringeth low and rai&s;eth up in his wi&s;dom and mercy. He knows when af|flictions are needful to his &s;ervants; and in this &s;ea&s;on of weakne&s;s, my &s;oul has thankfully acknowledged his tender care, to prevent my &s;pirit's &s;ettling with too great attention on
<Q>the things which are &s;een, and which are tem|poral.</Q>
We often want to be awakened to &s;eek with greater earne&s;tne&s;s tho&s;e
<Q>things which are eternal,</Q>
viz. Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and its con&s;equence, Divine favour; by being put in remembrance, that the time of our depar|ture hence may be at hand. "Ble&s;&s;ed" in|deed
<Q>is that &s;ervant who, when his Lord cometh</Q>
and calleth from works to rewards "he &s;hall find watching:" and what great need is there to watch again&s;t the encroaching &s;pirit of this world; whereby many quickened, enlightened minds have been benumbed and darkened; and their de&s;ires after the food which nouri&s;heth up the &s;oul unto everla&s;ting life, weakened; until at length they have left the Lord's table, and fed with plea&s;ure at the table of idols! The friend&s;hips of this world, which are enmity with God, have been de|lighted and gloried in, and its intere&s;ts princi|pally &s;ought.</P>
<P>The&s;e, though they may appear orderly in the view of men, are in danger of becoming as "trees twice dead;" they having been dead in a &s;tate of nature, and quickened by Divine grace. If the&s;e totally fall away from their
<PB N="225" REF="034371_0225_0FFC301B8C5EABF8">
&s;piritual exerci&s;e, how &s;hall they be again re|newed? Alas! the judgment is determined; they mu&s;t be plucked out of the Lord's plan|tation, wherein only living fruit-bearing trees can remain with acceptance.'</P>
<P>'In this time of weakne&s;s my &s;pirit hath been renewedly vi&s;ited, and my under&s;tanding opened in Divine love and light: and therefore it re&s;ts with me to commemorate it, as a fre&s;h in&s;tance of the love of my heavenly Father; who, in all the di&s;pen&s;ations of his wi&s;dom to his children, &s;eeks their being perfected in righteou&s;ne&s;s; that he may more and more ble&s;s them with his favour whil&s;t here, and finally receive them into everla&s;ting man&s;ions of bli&s;s.'</P>
<P>But although I grew &s;o much better as to get about in the &s;pring, my con&s;titution &s;till laboured under a heavy load, without hope of being entirely relieved; and I was therefore frequently led to pray for patience and re&s;igna|tion to &s;uffer in the way Divine wi&s;dom might permit; and, under great weakne&s;s, was en|abled in a degree to come up in the &s;ervice ap|pointed me, in our little meeting and about home. I was reduced &s;o extremely low by this indi&s;po&s;ition, as to be doubtful, whether I could have &s;urvived it, had I not been re|moved from my mother's family; as in that, con&s;idering her &s;ituation, and my brother's, it was unlikely I &s;hould have been &s;o relea&s;ed from care, and &s;o tenderly and affectionately
<PB N="226" REF="034371_0226_0FFC301961A1DD00">
attended to, as by my dear hu&s;band, and the a&s;&s;i&s;tance he procured for me.</P>
<P>In the Seventh month I left home in order to attend the Circular yearly meeting and once more vi&s;it my aged and honourable parent, who had &s;everal times expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire to &s;ee me. My hu&s;band accompanied me to Torring|ton, where we had a meeting of friends &s;cat|tered round in that neighbourhood. From Torrington he went to Appledore, and cro&s;&s;ed the Channel into Wales, and I proceeded to Bri&s;tol; where, and in its neighbourhood, I &s;taid until my hu&s;band's bu&s;ine&s;s admitted his coming to me; and thence we proceeded to Dudley, vi&s;iting the meetings of Stourbridge and Worce&s;ter in our way. I found my dear mother extremely weak, and her faculties &s;o impaired that &s;he did not know me; yet I thought &s;he was &s;en&s;ible I was one for whom &s;he had a great affection; and after &s;eeing me &s;everal times &s;he recollected me, and was much plea&s;ed with my company. After I had taken my leave of her, &s;he &s;aid, 'Now I &s;hall not be here long;' and &s;o it proved, for &s;he died in the following winter. [See a more particular account of her in the former part of the&s;e me|moirs.]</P>
<P>From Dudley we proceeded to the Circular yearly meeting held at Kington, Hereford&s;hire, which, con&s;idering the country not being &s;o populous as &s;ome others, and but few friends in the neighbourhood, was large, and for the mo&s;t part &s;atisfactory. I &s;till continued in a
<PB N="227" REF="034371_0227_0FFC301732BE3430">
weak &s;tate, yet was enabled to take a &s;hare in the &s;ervice, Divine mercy &s;trengthening be|yond my expectation. After this meeting we went to Bath, Dr. Fothergill having advi&s;ed me to drink the waters.</P>
<P>In the &s;pring of 1775 I vi&s;ited &s;ome meet|ings in Devon&s;hire, Somer&s;et&s;hire, and Dor|&s;et&s;hire, in my way to the yearly meeting at London. Lydia Hawk&s;worth accompanied me in &s;ome part of the journey. Such was my &s;tate of bodily weakne&s;s, that my getting along, and being enabled to go through with the &s;ervice a&s;&s;igned, claimed my admiration and thankfulne&s;s. I attended the meetings in Lon|don with con&s;iderable diligence, though very unwell, got out of town as &s;oon as I could, and, accompanied by Lydia Hawk&s;worth, went to her mother's, Deborah Waring, at Alton; where I re&s;ted a few days, and then proceeded to the quarterly meetings for Hamp|&s;hire and Dor&s;et&s;hire held at Ringwood and Poole; and &s;o to our quarterly meeting at Looe. Here I met my dear hu&s;band, to our mutual rejoicing, although my languid &s;tate affected him painfully. From Looe we return|ed home, and through Divine favour I &s;o ga|thered &s;trength, as that in the Eighth Month I again left home, accompanied by my hu&s;|band, intending to go through Wales to the Circular yearly meeting. I had &s;everal meet|ings in our own county and Devon&s;hire to good &s;atisfaction, and we cro&s;&s;ed the Channel from Appledore to Swan&s;ea.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="034371_0228_0FFC301507FF68B8">A circum&s;tance happened at Appledore wor|thy of ob&s;ervation. Some &s;ober people of that place were de&s;irous of a meeting; but I was re&s;trained from having one &s;o publick as was wi&s;hed, yet was quite free to &s;it down in a friendly woman's hou&s;e, with &s;uch as &s;he might think proper to invite. The meeting was held in an upper room the window of which fronted the river. A number of &s;eri|ous people came, and I had a favoured oppor|tunity among&s;t them. Immediately as I &s;at down, one of the per&s;ons pre&s;ent &s;tepped to me, and told me, the ve&s;&s;el we had wi&s;hed to go in was getting under &s;ail. This was unex|pected intelligence, as we were informed &s;he would not &s;ail that tide, and had not taken our pa&s;&s;age in her. Had we held our meeting in another place, &s;he had probably &s;lipped away without our knowledge; as her &s;ailing was perceived by the before-mentioned per&s;on in the meeting from the window. As I was now free to go, I took a gla&s;s of wine, and immediately went out at the back-door, into a boat, and on board. My hu&s;band went to the inn, and reached the &s;hip, with our clothes, in a boat, before &s;he got over the bar. We had a good pa&s;&s;age; but had we mi&s;&s;ed this opportunity, we &s;hould have &s;uffered much in coming in a &s;loop the next day, as the weather changed to wet and &s;tormy. This is one of the many in&s;tances of providential direction I have experienced.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="034371_0229_0FFC30122C942BA0">We &s;taid at and about Swan&s;ea about two weeks; and thence proceeded to Leomin&s;ter, Worce&s;ter, and Dudley. From Dudley, after &s;pending a &s;hort time with my brother, we went to the Circular yearly meeting held at Cole&s;hill, Warwick&s;hire; which was large and Divinely favoured. From Cole&s;hill we went through Coventry to Warwick, &s;pent a little time with my &s;i&s;ter, who, with her hu&s;band and &s;on, were now &s;ettled there; and thence we went through Eve&s;ham, Pain&s;wick, &amp;c. home, where we arrived in &s;afety.</P>
<P>In this winter a concern re&s;ted upon my mind once more to vi&s;it Friends in Ireland; and, in my way to that kingdom, to attend the quarterly meetings at York, Lanca&s;ter, and We&s;tmoreland, and the yearly meeting for the four northern counties to be held at Ke&s;|wick. My beloved friend Lydia Hawk&s;worth was given up to accompany me, and we ac|cordingly prepared for the journey; and in Fir&s;t month 1776 my hu&s;band accompanied me to Bri&s;tol. The weather was extremely cold, and the &s;now &s;o deep that the roads in De|von&s;hire, and thence to Bri&s;tol, had been im|pa&s;&s;able, and were then dangerous; but through Divine favour we got along &s;afe, al|though the cold was &s;o extreme that it was hard to bear. The road in &s;ome places was cut through the &s;now, &s;o that it looked like pa&s;&s;ing through a deep hollow way, which had a very &s;triking appearance. At Bri&s;tol, my dear hu&s;band left me, to go to Swan&s;ea,
<PB N="230" REF="034371_0230_0FFC300FD4D03F40">
where he arrived &s;afe, although the Severn at the New Pa&s;&s;age, where it is three miles over, was &s;o full of ice as to render cro&s;&s;ing danger|ous.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t at this juncture, my companion's mo|ther died, and &s;he went to attend her funeral. I &s;taid over Fir&s;t-day at Bri&s;tol meetings, and proceeded, through &s;ome meetings in Glouce&s;|ter&s;hire, &amp;c. to Dudley, where my &s;i&s;ter met me. We &s;pent &s;ome time together with my brother, and I went to Birmingham, where I was met by my companion, and we proceeded on our journey. Our fir&s;t meeting was held in the town hall at Stafford, which was large, &s;olemn, and &s;atisfactory. From thence we went to Leek, and pa&s;&s;ed, through &s;everal meetings in Che&s;hire and Lanca&s;hire, to Shef|field, and &s;o, through many meetings in York|&s;hire, to the quarterly meeting at York. Af|ter the meeting at York I was concerned to have one at Tadca&s;ter, where there was no Friend's meeting-hou&s;e; and another near Harwood, which was very &s;atisfactory; and another, on the Fir&s;t-day, at Otley, which was large, and I hope &s;erviceable. Thence we went, through &s;everal meetings, to Lan|ca&s;ter, attended the quarterly meeting there, afterwards to We&s;tmoreland quarterly meeting held at Kendal, thence to the yearly meeting at Ke&s;wick, and &s;o to Cockermouth and Whitehaven. We had travelled from Bir|mingham in &s;ixty-two days, 500 miles, and attended &s;ixty-&s;ix meetings; and as much of
<PB N="231" REF="034371_0231_0FFC300D98CD03A8">
the &s;ervice of meetings lay upon me, my na|tural &s;trength was greatly exhau&s;ted before I embarked for Ireland: but I had abundant cau&s;e to acknowledge that Divine aid was from time to time di&s;pen&s;ed; by which I was ena|bled to pre&s;s forward, though under very pain|ful feelings.</P>
<P>We went on board a large ve&s;&s;el at White-haven on the 21&s;t of the Fourth month, and landed at Dublin the 25th. Our pa&s;&s;age was not without danger. One night a ve&s;&s;el run &s;o near ours, that they became entangled in their rigging. The captain and &s;ailors were much alarmed, but we got clear. How im|prudent it is for ve&s;&s;els not to hang out their lights. As our pre&s;ervation was great, it claimed our deep thankfulne&s;s: a very little more, and probably one of the ve&s;&s;els had &s;unk, and the other might have been much damaged. Another night we lay at anchor near the I&s;le of Man, and had rea&s;on to con|clude our&s;elves in &s;hallow water upon a &s;and|bank. Had the wind blown up fre&s;h, it might probably have been of bad con&s;equence.</P>
<P>Our captain had not been accu&s;tomed to navigate the Iri&s;h Channel: and when we drew near Dublin Bar, appeared regardle&s;s of the danger of cro&s;&s;ing it, wi&s;hing to get into port without a pilot, although the wind was rough. A pilot, however, e&s;pying us, came on board, and took the ve&s;&s;el &s;afe in; but the tide was &s;o far &s;pent, that &s;he threw up the
<PB N="232" REF="034371_0232_0FFC300C0D99B080">
mud with her keel, as we pa&s;&s;ed the bank called the Great Bull.</P>
<P>We arrived at Dublin a few days before the national half-year's meeting began. This allowed us time to attend &s;everal meetings with the friends of that city; wherein the &s;pring of mini&s;try was livingly opened to the &s;tates of many profe&s;&s;ors among&s;t us: and although I had to lament the &s;tript &s;tate of that city, through the removal of u&s;eful members, and the weakne&s;s of many who remained in the &s;ociety; yet was there cau&s;e for thankfulne&s;s, in feeling the fre&s;h extending of the Divine vi&s;i|tation to them. The half-year's meeting was large, and &s;ignally favoured with an awaken|ing &s;earching vi&s;itation; and I was &s;o helped therein, that many of my friends, who had been with me in former &s;ervices in that nation, rejoiced that the heavenly Ma&s;ter had again &s;ent me to &s;ee how they fared.</P>
<P>I write the&s;e remarks in reverence and thank|fulne&s;s to the Great putter forth, and qualifier for the &s;ervices he appoints; who, to keep the minds of tho&s;e whom he favours humble, permits them to be tried with hidden exerci&s;es. This was my ca&s;e through the cour&s;e of this journey, wherein the &s;pring of go&s;pel-mini&s;try was largely opened; and I often appeared to my friends as well clothed with a royal robe, though, underneath, I was girded as with &s;ackcloth.</P>
<P>From Dublin, we proceeded to vi&s;it the meetings through the main body of Friends in
<PB N="233" REF="034371_0233_0FFC3009D82369B0">
Lein&s;ter province, to that of Ul&s;ter; wherein we vi&s;ited all the meetings, except two or three very &s;mall ones, the friends belonging to which we de&s;ired to meet us at another meet|ing.</P>
<P>We attended the quarterly meetings in both provinces, and returned back to Dublin the 2d of the Seventh month, where we &s;taid un|til the 12th: in which time we attended meet|ings either for wor&s;hip or di&s;cipline almo&s;t every day; and Divine conde&s;cen&s;ion in open|ing fre&s;h matter, &s;uited to the &s;everal occa&s;i|ons, was &s;o admirable, that it appeared as if every &s;tate and office in the &s;ociety were mi|ni&s;tered to.</P>
<P>By this time my natural &s;trength was much exhau&s;ted; yet we pre&s;&s;ed on through the counties of Wicklow and Wexford, and were at a province meeting at Enni&s;corthy, which was very large and crowned with &s;olemnity. Here we took leave of friends of that pro|vince, and proceeded to that of Mun&s;ter, wherein there are but few meetings, but the di&s;tances mo&s;tly long. My reduced &s;tate ren|dered it hard getting along; yet I was enabled to vi&s;it all the meetings, except a &s;mall one at Bandon, and favoured to di&s;charge my duty therein; although my voice was &s;ometimes &s;o weak, that it was with extreme difficulty I ex|erted it to &s;peak &s;o as to be under&s;tood. When we came to Clonmell, and had attend|ed the meeting there, it &s;eemed proper for us to retire to the hou&s;e of our friend John
<PB N="234" REF="034371_0234_0FFC3007AF7C5B58">
Grubb about two miles out of the town; whither I went the 8th of the Eighth month, and &s;taid until the 14th, being much indi&s;po&s;|ed. Here I was affectionately received and at|tended, and the quarterly meeting for the pro|vince being held at Clonmell during my &s;tay there, many friends came to &s;ee me, and we were favoured together. I was enabled to &s;peak beyond my expectation, to the comfort and encouragement of &s;ome, and caution of others, and took a &s;olemn farewel of them in the love of Truth.</P>
<P>The 14th, we went to Waterford, but I continued &s;o much indi&s;po&s;ed, that it appeared be&s;t to go into the country; &s;o we retired to a village called Tramore, by the &s;ea-&s;ide. Here we &s;taid from the 15th of the Eighth month, till the 9th of the Ninth month. My indi&s;po&s;iti|on continued and reduced me very low; but, ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord, his hand &s;u&s;tained me, and through all, my &s;pirit was at times &s;et at liber|ty in his &s;ervice to the admiration of my&s;elf and friends; many of whom from Waterford came to us there, and we had divers &s;ea&s;onable opportunities with them, as well as with &s;ome who were at the place to bathe in the &s;ea. My nerves being extremely weak, I was al&s;o advi&s;ed to bathe, by the doctor who attended me, but I believe it had rather a bad effect. We had not &s;taid at Tramore &s;o long, had there been a &s;uitable ve&s;&s;el at Waterford, rea|dy to &s;ail for England. On our return thither, we had two meetings with Friends in a large
<PB N="235" REF="034371_0235_0FFC300585D85298">
parlour, at the hou&s;e of our friend I&s;aac Jacobs, my voice not being equal to a meeting in the meeting-hou&s;e. Thus we vi&s;ited Friends in that city pretty generally, and the 12th em|barked on board a ve&s;&s;el bound for Minehead. Our friend Robert Grubb, of Clonmell, ac|companied us, being, in &s;ympathy with us, inclined thereto; which we accepted as a fa|vour from Providence.</P>
<P>Our pa&s;&s;age was ea&s;y as to wind; but my great indi&s;po&s;ition, and my companion's ex|treme &s;ea-&s;ickne&s;s &s;eemed to render &s;uch an a&s;|&s;i&s;tant nece&s;&s;ary, and he was very attentive and &s;erviceable to us. When we came near our de&s;ired port, the wind turned again&s;t us and the weather became rough. However, the captain got over the bar ju&s;t in time, for had we been but one hour later, we mu&s;t have been driven back to &s;ea, if not to Waterford: we landed at Minehead the 14th. There is only Robert Davies's family of our &s;ociety in that town. He was from home, but one of his children met us upon the beach, from whence it was a long walk to his hou&s;e. When we came into the &s;treet, we &s;aw an empty cart going up it, and a&s;ked the carter to carry us to our friend's, which he readily did. My dear hu&s;band met us here, to our mutual &s;a|tisfaction; though to receive me back in &s;o weak a &s;tate was affecting to him. The 15th was Fir&s;t-day, but I did not attend the meet|ing at the meeting-hou&s;e, but had an oppor|tunity
<PB N="236" REF="034371_0236_0FFC3002B2AC7920">
in the afternoon with the friends belong|ing to it, in our friend's parlour.</P>
<P>The 16th, we left Minehead, and travelled homewards by ea&s;y &s;tages, my dear companion accompanying me to the verge of our county, whence &s;he turned to the Circular yearly meeting held at Bridgewater. She was indeed a mo&s;t tender affectionate companion, and a deep travailer in &s;pirit, both in meetings and private opportunities: and although her pub|lic &s;ervice in this journey was not large, it was very acceptable; and her private labours in many families were &s;ignally under that heavenly anointing, from which &s;he was concerned to mini&s;ter. I hoped to have been able to attend the Circular yearly meeting, and pre&s;&s;ed for|ward in Ireland, in the fore part of this jour|ney, in order to get to England in time; but after our return from the north to Dublin, it was much impre&s;&s;ed upon my mind, that I &s;hould have but ju&s;t &s;trength to accompli&s;h the &s;ervice in that nation, and &s;o it proved.</P>
<P>I had travelled in this journey in England and Ireland, about 2000 Engli&s;h miles, and attended 192 meetings, be&s;ides family oppor|tunities, and vi&s;iting the &s;ick. Sometimes we had &s;everal private meetings of this kind in one day, and &s;eldom were without one, at lea&s;t.</P>
<P>After my return home, I continued much indi&s;po&s;ed, and my nerves &s;o irritable that I had continual &s;pa&s;ms for a con&s;iderable time; and my dear brother James Payton came to vi&s;it
<PB N="237" REF="034371_0237_0FFC300076E14930">
me, and, becoming very unwell, was detained the winter. As I gathered &s;trength, I was enabled to attend upon little &s;ervices about home; and my friend Lydia Hawk&s;worth com|ing to &s;ee me, we vi&s;ited the families of friends in Falmouth and Marazion monthly meetings, except one or two of each, whom I afterwards &s;aw: in this &s;ervice the Lord was with us of a truth. Soon after Lydia Hawk&s;worth left me, Sarah Steven&s;on came to vi&s;it Friends in this county; in company with whom, I vi&s;ited mo&s;t of the families belonging to Au&s;tle month|ly meeting, to our mutual &s;atisfaction; my dear hu&s;band accompanying us in this &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Until the Seventh month in this year 1777, I had not been out of Cornwall &s;ince my re|turn from Ireland in the Ninth month 1776, which was the longe&s;t period I remember to have been confined within the limits of one county, &s;ince my fir&s;t journey in the &s;ervice of Truth into Wales, in the year 1749. I do not mention this as thinking much of my &s;er|vices; for although it has been my lot to be more con&s;tantly employed than many others of my fellow-labourers, I can truly &s;ay, I fre|quently look upon my&s;elf as an unprofitable &s;ervant; and when laid by a little, have to ruminate upon my many weakne&s;&s;es; under a &s;en&s;e whereof I feelingly acknowledge that what I am, that is acceptable to the Lord, or honourable in his hou&s;e, I am through his grace; and I often admire at his making choice of, and employing me &s;o much in his &s;ervice.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="034371_0238_0FFC2FFEED5B01F8">In the Seventh month this year, in company with my dear hu&s;band, I went to Swan&s;ea, his bu&s;ine&s;s, and to vi&s;it his mother, calling him thither. In our way we had a meeting with Friends in the north of Devon&s;hire; but being yet very weak, I was ea&s;y to pa&s;s along without engaging much in public &s;ervice. We had a good meeting at Appledore with &s;ome &s;erious people, and cro&s;&s;ed the Channel to Swan&s;ea, where we &s;taid about two weeks, and proceeded to Bri&s;tol.</P>
<P>In our way between Newport and the New Pa&s;&s;age (which we intended to cro&s;s), we re|ceived information that the Pa&s;&s;age-hou&s;e was &s;o full of people that there was no probability of our getting a lodging there; &s;o my hu&s;band intended going forward to Chep&s;tow, though neither of us liked the pro&s;pect of cro&s;&s;ing at the Old Pa&s;&s;age; but our minds, e&s;pecially mine, not being ea&s;y to proceed thither, we &s;topped at a &s;mall inn about two miles from the New Pa&s;&s;age, and got a comfortable lodging, and next morning proceeded to the New Pa&s;&s;age. We got &s;afe over the Channel, al|though the wind was &s;qually; but the &s;ame tide, the boat from the Old Pa&s;&s;age was lo&s;t, even while we were on the water, and &s;everal men, with many oxen, drowned. Had we gone to Chep&s;tow we &s;hould mo&s;t probably have been in her. Thus kind Providence &s;ig|nally pre&s;erved us.</P>
<P>After about a week's &s;tay at Bri&s;tol, and vi&s;iting Frenchay meeting, we went to Wor|ce&s;ter,
<PB N="239" REF="034371_0239_0FFC2FFCB590A198">
&s;o to Brom&s;grove and Dudley. I was &s;till in a very weak &s;tate, yet enabled to at|tend meetings, and labour in them to the com|fort of my friends and my own peace; although at times in great bodily pain. My &s;i&s;ter met me at Dudley, and we were glad to &s;ee each other. From Dudley we proceeded to the Circular yearly meeting held this year at Bewdley; and in our way we had a meeting with Friends at Stourbridge, wherein my weakne&s;s was &s;uch, that I could hardly impart what pre&s;&s;ed upon my mind &s;o as to be heard. I was di&s;couraged from looking towards the &s;olemnity at Bewdley, with expectation of be|ing able to take much part in the public &s;er|vice; but was de&s;irous to be a&s;&s;i&s;ted to labour in &s;pirit for the help of my brethren and &s;i&s;ters engaged therein. On the Seventh-day even|ing, the meeting for mini&s;ters and elders was held, wherein I had &s;omething to impart, but in &s;o low a voice as painfully to affect my friends; who might rea&s;onably conclude it probable that my &s;trength was &s;o exhau&s;ted, as that I &s;hould not long be capable of publick labour in the church; and indeed my own feelings of general weakne&s;s coincided with that apprehen&s;ion; but in the cour&s;e of the publick meetings the Lord's power was won|derfully manife&s;ted, in &s;trengthening me for &s;ervice, to the admiration of all who &s;aw my extreme weakne&s;s, and my own al&s;o. Indeed with humble gratitude I may acknowledge that it appeared miraculous; for I do not know
<PB N="240" REF="034371_0240_0FFC2FF9E92F6178">
whether I was ever able to &s;peak with greater &s;trength of voice and &s;entiment, than in the la&s;t meeting; &s;o that although the booth was very large and crowded, I believe all might hear: and to the prai&s;e of the Great Name be it commemorated that his power was &s;ig|nally over the meeting.</P>
<P>This extraordinary manife&s;tation of favour tended to &s;trengthen my mind, which for a long time had been &s;orely exerci&s;ed with many fears, in&s;omuch that my &s;pirit was weary in the conflict, and ready to hope for death rather than life. Yet was I &s;ecretly &s;u&s;tained &s;o as to pre&s;s forward, and mo&s;tly to pre&s;erve a cheerful countenance, &s;o that my friends could not perceive how my &s;pirit was exerci&s;ed and aba&s;ed in the &s;en&s;e of infirmities, even when I was evidently clothed for &s;ervice. Thus it hath plea&s;ed Divine wi&s;dom to permit me to be tried in my pa&s;&s;ing along from youth to ad|vanced age: doubtle&s;s for &s;ome good end, and I de&s;ire thankfully to commemorate his gracious and wi&s;e dealings with me, in humble hope that finally all will work together for good; when, having filled up my mea&s;ure of &s;uffer|ings, I may be accepted in and through his beloved Son. It is not for us to query why the&s;e afflicting di&s;pen&s;ations are appointed, but patiently to endeavour to wade through them. We may be certain they will tend to humble our &s;pirits and prepare for &s;ervice, as my &s;oul hath many times experienced; and therefore can pray, that I may be pa&s;&s;ive in regard to
<PB N="241" REF="034371_0241_0FFC2FF7B79FCEA0">
the dealings of the Lord with me, who be&s;t knows what is nece&s;&s;ary to effect the glorious purpo&s;e he has in view, viz. the thorough &s;anctification of my &s;pirit, and reducing it into "the obedience of Chri&s;t:" concerning whom it is written
<Q>Although he was a &s;on, yet learned he obedience by the things which he &s;uffered;</Q>
and if &s;o, his &s;ervants can expect no other.</P>
<P>I have &s;ometimes con&s;idered what that &s;uf|fering of Chri&s;t was, whereby he learned obe|dience; &s;eeing that he could not &s;uffer for di&s;|obedience, being in all things &s;ubject to the will of his Father. But as man he was made like unto us, and had the &s;ame feelings as have the members of his my&s;tical body; and al|though he was never overcome of the enemy, was liable to be a&s;&s;aulted by him. He had to bear the contradiction of &s;inners again&s;t him|&s;elf; and, no doubt, in the cour&s;e of his mi|ni&s;try felt the oppre&s;&s;ive weight of contrary and wicked &s;pirits, as the members of his church now do in their mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>As man, we may &s;uppo&s;e that he had the &s;ame reluctance to pain and in&s;ult as we have; but in &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his Father's will, did and &s;uffered what he in wi&s;dom and mercy to man|kind appointed him. His followers al&s;o mu&s;t thus "be made conformable to his death," if they have part with him in his re&s;urrection unto glory. And although &s;ome of them may be left in &s;ea&s;ons of extreme conflict, as he was, the mo&s;t extreme, without the &s;en&s;ible feeling
<PB N="242" REF="034371_0242_0FFC2FF624D74258">
of the Divine pre&s;ence; yet that power which appoints their &s;uffering, &s;ecretly &s;u&s;tains under it; and when they have filled up their
<Q>mea|&s;ure of &s;uffering for his body's &s;ake, which is his Church,</Q>
with all other afflictions at|tendant on this probationary &s;tate, they will with him be able to &s;ay, "It is fini&s;hed;" and as
<Q>good and faithful &s;ervants enter into the joy of their Lord.</Q></P>
<P>After the before-mentioned memorable meet|ing at Bewdley, I recruited in health, though yet attended with very painful feelings. We returned home pretty directly, taking the quar|terly meeting for Somer&s;et&s;hire, and &s;ome other meetings in our way; and the remainder of this year I &s;pent at home, and attending &s;er|vices in our own county as they opened.</P>
<P>The 20th of the Fourth month 1778, I again left it in company with my dear hu&s;band intending for Wales, he having bu&s;ine&s;s there, and I had an engagement to attend the yearly meeting for that principality. We proceeded to Ilfracomb, and, in our way, had a meeting with Friends in the north of Devon at New|town. At Ilfracomb we had a large &s;atisfactory meeting, among&s;t a people very ignorant of our principles. We were detained here by contrary winds until Fir&s;t-day, and as we &s;at together in the morning, I earne&s;tly de&s;ired to know whether any further &s;ervice was requir|ed; as it did not appear probable we &s;hould be relea&s;ed that day; and afterwards as I &s;at quietly in my chamber, our Lord's words to
<PB N="243" REF="034371_0243_0FFC2FF3F62B08F0">
his di&s;ciples aro&s;e in my mind,
<Q>Ari&s;e, let us go hence,</Q>
and &s;oon after, the captain of the ve&s;&s;el came and told us he intended to &s;ail. We went on board in the afternoon, and be|fore midnight landed at the Mumbles, and the next morning proceeded to Swan&s;ea. My hu&s;band's mother was lately dead; concerning whom I may &s;ay, that &s;he was an exerci&s;ed woman, and I believe fini&s;hed her cour&s;e with joy, about the ninety-&s;eventh year of her age; and except her hearing, &s;he retained her facul|ties to admiration. As her furniture, with her &s;ervants, remained in her hou&s;e, we &s;ettled there.</P>
<P>The 2d of the Fifth month we went for the Welch yearly meeting, and were at a meeting by the way at New Inn meeting-hou&s;e, which was large and very &s;atisfactory. Samuel Spa|vold of Hitchin in Hertford&s;hire, John Lewis of Haverford-we&s;t, and Thomas Carrington, from North America, were there al&s;o; and we went in company that afternoon to a meet|ing which was appointed by John Lewis, at a friend's hou&s;e, not far out of the way to Llandovery, and to Llandovery the &s;ame night. Here the yearly meeting was held, and began the next day; and through the various &s;ittings, was a favoured &s;ea&s;on both to Friends and others. The weather being very wet, it was not &s;o large as was expected, but many &s;ober people attended, unto whom the go&s;pel flowed freely. In the cour&s;e of my travels before my marriage, I had two very &s;atisfactory meetings
<PB N="244" REF="034371_0244_0FFC2FF1D66254D8">
at this place, where none live who profe&s;s with us.</P>
<P>My &s;pirit, in the cour&s;e of the yearly meet|ing, was dipped into &s;ympathy with the few friends &s;cattered about Wales; and unto tho&s;e who were there a&s;&s;embled, encouragement and in&s;truction were afforded. In our return to Swan&s;ea, we had a large and much favoured meeting at Llandilo; the before-mentioned Friends and John Town&s;end of London at|tending it. They went back to a meeting at the New Inn meeting-hou&s;e, and next day we all met again at Swan&s;ea. The afternoon meeting there was large, &s;olemn, and in&s;truc|tive.</P>
<P>We &s;taid at Swan&s;ea until the 14th, then went to Cardiff, and on the next morning had a &s;mall meeting there with a few who met to|gether on the Fir&s;t-day; &s;everal of whom were not in member&s;hip with us. I was very unwell, but was helped to &s;peak to their &s;tates, and was well &s;atisfied with the opportunity. We reached the New Pa&s;&s;age that night, and next day we got to Bri&s;tol to attend the yearly meeting there, which was large and divinely favoured. Samuel Spavold, John Town&s;end, Thomas Carrington, and other friends in the mini&s;try attended it.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t I was at a meeting at Fren|chay, with Thomas Waring of Leomin&s;ter; and after the meeting, my friend Lydia Hawk&s;|worth and I had a good opportunity with a young woman, who was likely to marry out
<PB N="245" REF="034371_0245_0FFC2FEED5408570">
of the &s;ociety. She was much affected, yet held her re&s;olution to engage in the connection. Her intended hu&s;band was a man of property, and had long re&s;ided in America, whereto he took her, and there &s;he died. Her death was occa&s;ioned through a &s;ingular circum&s;tance. In the time of the American war, her hu&s;|band's e&s;tate was taken from him, but was re|covered after its termination. When intelli|gence was brought her of its being re&s;tored, &s;he lay in, I think of her &s;econd child; and the plea&s;ing news &s;o affected her then weak &s;pi|rits, that &s;he died.</P>
<P>In the afternoon we had a much favoured &s;ea&s;on at Jo&s;eph Beck's, with many young people, and returned that night to Bri&s;tol. The 24th (Fir&s;t-day), we were at Claverham meeting, the 25th and 26th at Bri&s;tol; my&s;elf unwell.</P>
<P>The 27th, I was at Bath meeting, which was not large but favoured, returned to Bri&s;|tol, and the 30th, we went to Pont-y-pool. The 31&s;t (Fir&s;t-day), we attended two meet|ings at Friends meeting-hou&s;e at Pont-y-moil, near Pont-y-pool. That in the morning was principally for Friends, that in the afternoon was large, and both opportunities were crown|ed with the Divine pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>Sixth month 1&s;t, we had a meeting at Car|diff with a few &s;ober people. In our way back to Swan&s;ea we called upon a convinc|ed woman, who lived alone near Cow|bridge, who was comforted by our vi&s;it. We
<PB N="246" REF="034371_0246_0FFC2FED362943D0">
&s;taid at Swan&s;ea until the 12th, attending the meetings there in their cour&s;e, &s;ome of which were &s;ea&s;ons of Divine favour. My mind being drawn to vi&s;it the few Friends at Ha|verford-we&s;t, my hu&s;band accompanied me there. The way was long, and my &s;trength much exhau&s;ted by the before-mentioned &s;er|vices; but I was favoured with ability to di&s;|charge my duty. We had a large meeting at Carmarthen the evening we left Swan&s;ea, and next day got to Haverford-we&s;t, attended two publick meetings there on the 14th, it be|ing Fir&s;t-day, and in the evening had a private opportunity with Friends. We had con&s;ider|able &s;atisfaction in this journey, and returned to Swan&s;ea, accompanied by our friend John Lewis, the 16th.</P>
<P>The 18th was the quarterly meeting at Swan|&s;ea, which although very &s;mall was a &s;olemn opportunity; Divine mercy favouring the few a&s;&s;embled from the &s;everal meetings, with coun&s;el and encouragement. The 19th, J. Lewis and my&s;elf had a meeting in the town|hall at Neath, which was not &s;o large as we expected, but, I believe it was a profitable &s;ea&s;on unto &s;ome pre&s;ent. The 20th, we went to Llantri&s;&s;ent, and the 21&s;t attended two large meetings at Tr&ecirc;f-y-Ryhg, a meeting-hou&s;e in the country.</P>
<P>The morning-meeting was much favoured. The few from Cardiff, and the poor lonely woman near Cowbridge, met us, and we had an opportunity with them and a few other
<PB N="247" REF="034371_0247_0FFC2FEB059CDBF0">
friends at a friend's hou&s;e. In our return to Swan&s;ea, we had a meeting at Bridgend, in a bowling-green, wherein was an arbour, un|der which I &s;tood. The people were very &s;till, and, I hope &s;ome were benefited. I was ex|tremely fatigued with this journey, having per|formed it mo&s;tly on hor&s;eback, double; which appeared the be&s;t method of travelling in &s;ome part of the journey, but I found my &s;trength was not equal to that exerci&s;e in &s;uch long &s;tages.</P>
<P>The 28th (Fir&s;t-day) I attended a &s;mall meeting held at Neath, in a friend's hou&s;e, in the morning; and in the evening had a very large meeting at White Rock, among&s;t the workmen of the Copper Hou&s;e and others. This was the la&s;t meeting I appointed in Wales, and left Swan&s;ea with peace and thankfulne&s;s the 27th of the Sixth month, and returned to it no more. We reached Bri&s;tol the 29th, and got to Wellington the 1&s;t of the Seventh month, attending the Fir&s;t-day meetings there: that in the afternoon was very large, and both were good meetings. The 5th, we had a living meeting at Camelford in Cornwall, among&s;t a people not profe&s;&s;ing with us; but &s;ome of whom appeared to me to be near the king|dom. The 6th, we got home.</P>
<P>The 31&s;t of this month I had a meeting at the hou&s;e of a man lately convinced, in the pari&s;h of Breague; where &s;ome hundreds of people gathered, that we were obliged to hold it without doors. They generally behaved
<PB N="248" REF="034371_0248_0FFC2FE8325B5F68">
well, and &s;ome were much affected. It was a favoured opportunity, and I was truly thankful for Divine aid to di&s;charge my duty therein.</P>
<P>The 13th of the Ninth month, the Circu|lar yearly meeting for the we&s;tern counties be|gan. It was held at Launce&s;ton, and was a large and favoured &s;olemnity; and, although I did not think the mini&s;try ro&s;e &s;o high as I have known it in &s;ome of tho&s;e general meet|ings, it appeared to be a &s;erviceable opportuni|ty, and the people &s;eemed well &s;atisfied there|with. I &s;pent the remaining part of this year about home, and was favoured in occa&s;ional &s;ervices there among&s;t Friends and others. Upon con&s;idering the &s;ervice wherein I have been engaged &s;ince I &s;ettled in Cornwall, I &s;ee cau&s;e for true thankfulne&s;s, having therein been owned by the heavenly Ma&s;ter: and al|though in regard to uniting with us as a people, much fruit has not appeared; the te&s;timony of Truth &s;eems to gain ground among&s;t the inha|bitants, and &s;ome of our own &s;ociety and others, are awakened and &s;trengthened thereby; &s;o that I tru&s;t I have not run nor laboured in vain altogether. May the Lord pre&s;erve me hum|ble and dependent upon him&s;elf, that what&s;o|ever I am or do, it may be by his grace.</P>
<P>In the Fir&s;t month, 1779, our quarterly meeting at Au&s;tle was a memorable &s;ea&s;on of Divine love, wherein many &s;tates were mini&s;|tered to, and many hearts tendered. The re|bellious were warned, and I believe &s;ome of them &s;aw the imminent danger of their &s;tates;
<PB N="249" REF="034371_0249_0FFC2FE607364488">
but alas! the prophet's complaint re&s;pecting Ephraim, &amp;c. too well befits many vi&s;ited minds.
<Q>Their righteou&s;ne&s;s is as a morn|ing cloud, and as the early dew which &s;oon pa&s;&s;eth away;</Q>
yet I tru&s;t the &s;avour of love and life witne&s;&s;ed in this meeting re&s;ted &s;weetly upon &s;ome minds.</P>
<P>For &s;ome time after this meeting, my exer|ci&s;e for &s;ome of the members of our own &s;ocie|ty was heavy, and I was livingly opened in &s;e|veral meetings, and private opportunities, a|greeably to their &s;tates; &s;o that whether the la|bour be&s;towed hath its de&s;ired effect, or be as water &s;pilt upon a &s;tone, I hope to be clear re|&s;pecting them: and great is the mercy of God in vi&s;iting and revi&s;iting them.</P>
<P>The 1&s;t of the Third month, I had a large good meeting at Hel&s;ton, which many &s;erious and religious people attended, and I believe were in&s;tructed and refre&s;hed.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<P>FOR &s;ome time I had entertained a pro&s;|pect of vi&s;iting &s;ome meetings in Somer|&s;et&s;hire and Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, and paying a par|ticular vi&s;it to the families of friends in Here|ford&s;hire. I left home to accompli&s;h this &s;er|vice, accompanied by my dear hu&s;band; and on the 13th of the Third month 1779, we met our friend Lydia Hawk&s;worth, who was con|cerned to accompany me therein, at Welling|ton. The 14th, being the fir&s;t of the week, we attended Friend's meeting at Spice-land; and in the evening had a &s;elect opportunity with Friends at Wellington. My hu&s;band then pro|ceeding to Bri&s;tol on bu&s;ine&s;s, we indu&s;triou&s;ly pur&s;ued our concern, vi&s;iting many meetings in that week; and on the 21&s;t (Fir&s;t-day) were met by my hu&s;band, and my brother James Payton, at Puddimore meeting. We went the &s;ame evening to Compton in Dor&s;et&s;hire, to vi&s;it our valuable friends Jonah Thomp&s;on and his &s;on; &s;pent the next day with them; and in the evening had a meeting with their &s;cholars and others of the family and many of the neigh|bours, in the &s;chool-room, which was a fa|voured &s;ea&s;on; and we proceeded to Sherborn meeting on the 24th. Here my hu&s;band and
<PB N="251" REF="034371_0251_0FFC2FE24A0BAF90">
brother left us, and next morning we proceed|ed to Hollowtrow, had a meeting there in the afternoon, went the &s;ame night to Pensford, next day to a meeting at Bolton, thence to Chew Magna, and were at the Fir&s;t-day meeting held there on the 28th.</P>
<P>The 30th we had a meeting at Port&s;head, and cro&s;&s;ing the Avon at Pill, were at King's We&s;ton meeting on the 31&s;t; thence went to tho&s;e at Olve&s;ton and Thornbury, and thence to Worce&s;ter. In the&s;e meetings in the coun|ties of Somer&s;et and Glouce&s;ter, I was ena|bled to di&s;charge my duty to my own hum|bling admiration, and the edification of many who attended them.</P>
<P>The quarterly meeting for the county of Worce&s;ter being held at Worce&s;ter, we at|tended it, and al&s;o two meetings with friends of that city; and on the 7th of the Fourth month, went to Bramyard in Hereford&s;hire, where we were met by my brother Young and Thomas Waring of Leomin&s;ter; who united with us in the intended vi&s;it to the families of friends in that county, which we began at this place. In this laborious and important &s;ervice we were Divinely a&s;&s;i&s;ted. My dear compa|nion had a con&s;iderable and very acceptable &s;hare therein; which was generally the ca&s;e in family vi&s;its, and private opportunities, al|though &s;he was frequently &s;ilent in publick meetings. She was peculiarly gifted for the&s;e private &s;ervices, and when &s;he did appear in publick mini&s;try, her &s;ervice therein was very
<PB N="252" REF="034371_0252_0FFC2FDF79D976A8">
edifying, and acceptable to Friends. Having an intention to return to Bri&s;tol before the yearly meeting was held there, we pur&s;ued this &s;ervice with diligence, and on the 24th of the Fourth month, we paid our la&s;t vi&s;it.</P>
<P>My brother Young had accompanied us through the vi&s;it, but Thomas Waring left us at Almelly on the 18th, their company was acceptable and &s;trengthening to us.</P>
<P>On the 25th (being Fir&s;t-day) we had a meeting at Shire Newton in Monmouth&s;hire, which was attended by many of the Welch people, and the few friends in the neighbour|hood, and, I believe was an acceptable oppor|tunity to them. In the evening we had a meet|ing with Mary Powel of Chep&s;tow and &s;ome others. She was the only member of our &s;oci|ety re&s;iding in that town; where a meeting of Friends was never &s;ettled. Next morning, we proceeded to the New Pa&s;&s;age, but the boat be|ing gone a few minutes before we reached it, we were detained until the evening tide; but, through Divine mercy, we got &s;afe over, and reached Bri&s;tol about ten o'clock the &s;ame night.</P>
<P>My hu&s;band &s;taid with me at Bri&s;tol until the yearly meeting there was ended, which was large and attended by many mini&s;tering friends of this nation and America; yet a large &s;hare of the publick labour in the mini&s;try fell to my lot, at which I believe my brethren and &s;i&s;ters rejoiced; for I was a&s;&s;i&s;ted to mini&s;ter in the demon&s;tration of the &s;pirit and with power;
<PB N="253" REF="034371_0253_0FFC2FDD50348388">
and returned the prai&s;es due to Him who exalts and aba&s;es his &s;ervants, as he knows is mo&s;t conducive to his honour, and to their pre&s;er|vation. I &s;taid at Bri&s;tol to attend the marri|age of two friends with whom I was acquaint|ed; and then, accompanied by my hu&s;band, &s;et out for London. We attended a few meet|ings in our way, and reached London about a week before the yearly meeting, my&s;elf much &s;pent with hard labour and exerci&s;e. I was en|abled to attend the meetings in cour&s;e, during the &s;itting of the yearly meeting; and after its conclu&s;ion, with my hu&s;band and friend Lydia Hawk&s;worth, proceeded to Calne in Wilt&s;hire, attended the meeting of Friends there in the morning of the Fir&s;t-day, and had a publick meeting at Chippenham, appointed to begin at &s;ix in the evening. The meeting was large, and was a favoured opportunity; the people not profe&s;&s;ing with us behaved with becoming &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;ome of them were vi&s;ibly af|fected. It was long in gathering, which might occa&s;ion its being late before it concluded; yet my inclination being &s;trong to go to Melk&s;ham that night, we proceeded thither. Before we reached it, the family where we were to lodge were in bed, but the ma&s;ter of it, my relation Thomas Fowler, came down and received us with great kindne&s;s. Next day my dear hu&s;|band left us and went to Bri&s;tol and Swan&s;ea. I had a view of vi&s;iting &s;ome places in the neighbourhood; but my &s;trength was exhau&s;t|ed too much to &s;uffer me to engage immediate|ly

upon &s;ervice. In the next night I was much indi&s;po&s;ed, and in the morning &s;ent for an apo|thecary, who thought my di&s;order was the effects of a cold; but it proved a fever, which, with the weakne&s;s attendant thereon, confined me for &s;ome weeks with the&s;e my affectionate relations; who&s;e tender care and generous treatment of me, both now and at all times, when my lot was ca&s;t under their ho&s;pitable roof, demands my grateful acknowledgement, both of their kindne&s;s, and that of my hea|venly Father: who&s;e mercy was at this time &s;ignally di&s;covered in upholding my enfeebled frame until I came to friends by whom I was &s;o well nur&s;ed, and with whom my mind was &s;o ea&s;y. My affectionate companion continued al&s;o with me, and tenderly a&s;&s;i&s;ted me until my fever went off. My hu&s;band returned to me; but his bu&s;ine&s;s calling him home, and my &s;trength not being equal to &s;o long a journey, he left me to the care of my friends. As my &s;trength returned, my pro&s;pect of &s;ome &s;ervice in the neighbourhood returned al&s;o, and I ven|tured to the meeting at Bradford upon a Fir&s;t-day; but my principal concern was to hold a publick meeting at Trowbridge, in which town no one re&s;ided who profe&s;&s;ed with Friends. I went, in weakne&s;s, accompanied by &s;everal friends, and appeared to a friend of London who ca&s;ually met me there &s;o emaciated, that when &s;he returned home, &s;he reported among&s;t friends there, that it appeared to her my la|bours were near accompli&s;hed. We held a
<PB N="255" REF="034371_0255_0FFC2FD9674FFAE8">
meeting in a large dining-room at the inn, which was attended by many attentive well-behaved people; and the te&s;timony of Truth was exalted among&s;t them, to the prai&s;e of Him who &s;trengthens for every &s;ervice in which he engages his &s;ervants. I was that day made &s;trong to declare of his wi&s;dom and mercy, and preach the doctrines of his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and returned to Melk&s;ham in peace, and with thankfulne&s;s for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance afford|ed in that memorable day's labour. After this meeting, I was ea&s;y to return home; &s;o, ac|companied by my companion and a friend of Melk&s;ham, I left that place; and with her got to a country meeting held at Grenton in So|mer&s;et&s;hire on the Fir&s;t-day, which was attended by many of the country people, both of that place and its neighbourhood, and was a fa|voured opportunity. There being a funeral at the publick burying-ground on the preced|ing evening, our friends Beaven, with whom we lodged, gave notice (at my reque&s;t) of the meeting to the people who attended it, which occa&s;ioned it to be the larger.</P>
<P>In the afternoon we had a private opportu|nity with the Friends, and next day proceed|ed to Wellington, and from thence towards Oakhampton; where we met my dear hu&s;band, to our mutual rejoicing and thankfulne&s;s, with whom we proceeded to our quarterly meeting held at Looe, and thence home, where we came in the early part of the Seventh month. As I had not pre&s;erved any minutes of my
<PB N="256" REF="034371_0256_0FFC2FD6948C1DD8">
movements &s;ince the yearly meeting at Lon|don, I could not in&s;ert dates.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of my health required re&s;t, and I was favoured with it; and having the com|pany of my dear friend Hawk&s;worth, her at|tention was turned to a&s;&s;i&s;t in re&s;toring my &s;trength; and as &s;he al&s;o was in need of re&s;t, I hope &s;he gained &s;ome advantage by accom|panying me home; although our quiet was di&s;turbed in the Eighth month, by an alarm of the French and Spani&s;h fleets being off Falmouth Harbour. What their de&s;ign was could not be known, but there they lay for &s;ome days, the wind not permitting them to go up the channel; and as they did not at|tempt to land, it was conjectured that their ho&s;tile views were towards Plymouth, and the King's dock near that place. Soon after they had &s;ailed up the Channel, being in our week|day meeting, with my mind retired to the Lord, under an exerci&s;e on account of the in|tended mi&s;chief, it run through it,
<Q>He &s;ent forth lightnings and &s;cattered them.</Q>
I think, as we returned home from meeting, the wind was ri&s;ing; the &s;ky &s;oon loured, and a terrible &s;torm gathered and di&s;charged it&s;elf, with fierce lightning, tremendous thunder, and violent rain; which continued more or le&s;s through great part of the night, and indeed the thunder until the next evening. The fleets were, by the time the &s;torm began, got near Plymouth; and we heard that the commanders had deliberated about the bu&s;ine&s;s they had
<PB N="257" REF="034371_0257_0FFC2FD4672EEDF8">
in view; but the Lord, who holdeth
<Q>the winds in his fi&s;ts,</Q>
di&s;charged again&s;t them his terrible artillery &s;o powerfully, as to pre|vent their de&s;igns, and obliged them to &s;heer off from our coa&s;ts in a &s;hattered &s;tate. O! what frequent occa&s;ions have Britons to
<Q>prai&s;e the Lord for his mercy,</Q>
and wonderful in|terference in their favour! but alas! though in words they acknowledge it, the generality of them are not concerned to make tho&s;e re|turns which he is calling for; but continue in a cour&s;e of conduct, and di&s;po&s;ition of mind, which dares his righteous judgments: which will one day be poured forth upon the inhabit|ants of this highly favoured but ungrateful nation, unle&s;s they repent and turn from their manifold iniquity.</P>
<P>I choo&s;e here to mention a remark of a &s;en|&s;ible inhabitant of the town of Hel&s;ton, upon this &s;ignal and memorable &s;torm, &s;o favourable to this nation. He told me, that &s;eeing it ga|thering, and having people at work on his har|ve&s;t, he ha&s;tened to direct their labours. As he went, he made his ob&s;ervation on the wind, &amp;c, and I think he &s;aid that &s;uch was the con|fu&s;ion of the elements, that he could not &s;ay from what point the wind blew; and he &s;aid in his mind, 'This is no natural &s;torm:' and indeed it proved to be &s;ignally providential, and as &s;uch worthy of commemoration; as is al&s;o a circum&s;tance which happened in the town of Falmouth. As &s;oon as government had in|telligence of the enemies lying in great force
<PB N="258" REF="034371_0258_0FFC2FD2DD7ADC18">
off that port, ammunition was ha&s;tened for the garri&s;on there. The waggons halted in the market place, to which the &s;ea comes up, whence the inhabitants fetch &s;ea-water for &s;ome u&s;es. A woman coming up with a buck|et of water at the in&s;tant the ammunition wag|gons &s;topped, ob&s;erved that the axletree of one of them was on fire, and da&s;hed her wa|ter upon it. As the fire was on the &s;ide next the &s;ea, if &s;he had not di&s;covered it, it might have increa&s;ed until it had blown up its danger|ous loading; and there being al&s;o a quantity of gun-powder in that part of the town, the hou&s;es might have been much damaged, and &s;ome lives lo&s;t.</P>
<P>My dear friend Hawk&s;worth left me in the latter end of this month, or early in the next; and I was allowed to &s;tay at and about home for the remainder of this year.</P>
<P>In the early part of the year 1780, I attend|ed &s;everal large meetings in Cornwall, held on account of marriages or funerals, which were &s;ignally honoured with the Divine pre&s;ence. I al&s;o was at our quarterly meeting at Fal|mouth; and on the 3d of the Fifth month my hu&s;band and I left home to attend our annual &s;olemnity in London. In our way we had meet|ings at &s;everal places, and called at Compton to pay our la&s;t vi&s;it to our beloved friend Jo|nah Thom&s;on, who was near the clo&s;e of an honourable life. We found his mind awfully collected, and waiting for his relea&s;e from a pained body, in certain hope of his &s;pirit's be|ing
<PB N="259" REF="034371_0259_0FFC2FD0A739BF80">
admitted into the &s;aints re&s;t, after having laboured many years in the work of the mini|&s;try. In the younger part of my life, he had conducted him&s;elf towards me as a tender fa|ther; and in my more advanced years, as an affectionate friend. He had al&s;o a &s;incere re|gard to my hu&s;band, and as our affection was mutual, our interview and farewel was affecting.</P>
<P>The yearly meeting at London was large and favoured by the heavenly Ma&s;ter of the a&s;&s;emblies of his &s;ervants. From London, we went, accompanied by our friend L. Hawk&s;|worth, to a general meeting held annually at We&s;ton in Buckingham&s;hire, and &s;o to High Wycombe. My hu&s;band returned to London, and Lydia Hawk&s;worth and my&s;elf proceeded to Reading, where we met a committee, who, by appointment of the yearly meeting, were going to vi&s;it the meeting for di&s;cipline in Bri|&s;tol. We attended &s;everal meetings with them in our way to that city, where we arrived on the 1&s;t of the Sixth month.</P>
<P>Before I left Cornwall, I had informed friends of our monthly meeting, that I was under an engagement of duty to attend the quarterly meeting for Oxford&s;hire to be held at Banbury, and to vi&s;it &s;ome meetings in Warwick&s;hire, Worce&s;ter&s;hire, Shrop&s;hire, and Glonce&s;ter&s;hire, al&s;o to attend the Circular yearly meeting to be held at Hereford; where|with they concurred. And my friend Lydia Hawk&s;worth being given up to accompany me, I &s;taid at and in the neighbourhood of Bri&s;tol,
<PB N="260" REF="034371_0260_0FFC2FCDCA8E7BF0">
until the Seventh month, to afford her time to prepare for the journey. We went to Wor|ce&s;ter, and attended the meetings held there on the 1&s;t and 3d days: and thence proceeded to Eve&s;ham and Alce&s;ter. Several of the town's people, came to the meetings at Alce|&s;ter, and I was favoured to preach the ever|la&s;ting go&s;pel to them. The &s;ame evening, we reached Eatington, were at the meeting there on the Fir&s;t-day, whereto many friends from an adjacent meeting came, at my reque&s;t, and I hope it was a profitable opportunity: we pro|ceeded that evening to Banbury, and to the hou&s;e of Edward Stone, who&s;e wife was near|ly related to me, and with her hu&s;band receiv|ed and entertained us with affectionate kind|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>The quarterly meeting held at this place was a large and favoured &s;olemnity; and many people not profe&s;&s;ing with us attended the meetings, unto whom the go&s;pel of life and &s;alvation was preached in the demon&s;tration of the Divine &s;pirit. In the cour&s;e of the meet|ings, a dangerous accident befel me. In the womens' meeting-room was a gallery for mini|&s;tering friends, wherein my companion, my&s;elf, and other friends were &s;eated. Upon my ri&s;ing to &s;tep further, to make room for more, the floor gave way, and I &s;unk with it; but I re|ceived but little hurt, which might be e&s;teemed a &s;ingular mercy, con&s;idering how I was &s;itua|ted in the fall. Friends ought to be careful in examining the&s;e elevated &s;eats in old meet|ing-hou&s;es.
<PB N="261" REF="034371_0261_0FFC2FCB4321D970">
This was not the only time I have been in danger through the neglect of it.</P>
<P>From Banbury we went to a meeting at Redway, and to Warwick the 28th. We &s;taid here with my dear &s;i&s;ter Summerfield, until the 4th of the Eighth month, when we went to Ship&s;ton, where the quarterly meeting for Worce&s;ter&s;hire was held the next day, at which were many friends of that county, who rejoiced to &s;ee me, and we were favoured to|gether in the Divine pre&s;ence. On the 6th, we had a meeting at Long Compton, which, although &s;mall, was a favoured &s;ea&s;on. The &s;ame evening we had a meeting at Tredington at the hou&s;e of our friend William Lambly, who&s;e family was the only one of friends re&s;id|ing in that village. His neighbours attended, but appeared &s;o low in the knowledge of Di|vine Truths, that it was difficult to mini&s;ter to them &s;o as to be under&s;tood.</P>
<P>On the 7th, we returned to Warwick, and the 9th, being the fir&s;t of the week (accom|panied by my &s;i&s;ter), attended a large meeting of friends and other profe&s;&s;ors of religion, held annually at Birk&s;well; and on the &s;ame evening went to Coventry. We had a meet|ing there the 11th, and in the remainder of the week had meetings at &s;everal places among&s;t friends of Warwick&s;hire; and on Fir&s;t-day, the 16th, were at a large meeting which is held annually at Ather&s;ton. There I met ma|ny friends from divers counties, among&s;t whom I had laboured and been conver&s;ant before my
<PB N="262" REF="034371_0262_0FFC2FC9B3BB7438">
&s;ettling in Cornwall; and we were favoured together with the merciful vi&s;itation of Divine love and life. The 17th, we attended a monthly meeting for di&s;cipline held at Hart&s;hill. Here I left my &s;i&s;ter, who was &s;o much indi&s;|po&s;ed as not to be able to accompany us to the before-mentioned meeting at Ather&s;ton.</P>
<P>On the 18th, we went to the neighbourhood of Birmingham. We attended the week-day meetings there in this week, and al&s;o tho&s;e on the Fir&s;t-day&punc; I hope to the edification of ma|ny pre&s;ent, and vi&s;ited &s;everal of our friends; and on the 24th, were at a monthly meeting for di&s;cipline at Dudley. The 25th, we had a large and good meeting at Wolverhampton; and thence we went to Coalbrookdale, had a meeting there, and proceeding to the meetings of Shrew&s;bury, and the Bank, came back to Coalbrookdale meeting, Fir&s;t-day, the 29th. The Lord's power and pre&s;ence were evidently with us in our &s;ervices in this quarter; and after a &s;olemn opportunity in our friend Abiah Darby's family, at which &s;ome other friends were pre&s;ent, we left it and returned to Dud|ley; and I vi&s;ited friends in that quarter no more. We &s;taid with my dear brother until after the en&s;uing Fir&s;t-day, when the meetings were large; as has been u&s;ual, when I have vi&s;ited that place, &s;ince my removal from it; my old neighbours pre&s;&s;ing to the meetings, more generally than when I re&s;ided among&s;t them: and many times has the Divine power, and the te&s;timony of Truth, been exalted; to
<PB N="263" REF="034371_0263_0FFC2FC7805098D0">
the prai&s;e thereof, and the convincement of many of the truth of the doctrine preached, although but few have &s;o
<Q>believed unto righteou&s;ne&s;s,</Q>
as to make a public profe&s;|&s;ion thereof. Leaving Dudley, we had meet|ings at Stourbridge, Bewdley, and Brom&s;|grove: that at Bewdley did not tend to relieve my mind, being attended by very few of the town's people, unto whom we &s;uppo&s;e proper notice had not been given. On the next Fir&s;t-day we attended a large meeting which is held annually at Redditch; and thence we went to Worce&s;ter, &s;taid over the Third-day's meeting there, and proceeded to Camden to the fune|ral of a friend; then to a meeting at Stow in the Would and to Cirence&s;ter, and attended the meetings there on the Fir&s;t-day, which was a day of memorable favour to &s;ome &s;ouls. We vi&s;ited the meetings of Nail&s;worth, and paid a vi&s;it to my cou&s;in M. Fowler, at Min|chin Hampton; whence we went to Sodbury, had a meeting there, and proceeded to Bri&s;tol, where my dear hu&s;band was engaged in bu&s;i|ne&s;s: and although I &s;aw I mu&s;t return into Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, I was plea&s;ed to be permitted to &s;ee him before his return into Cornwall. From Bri&s;tol we went to the meetings at Fren|chay and Thornbury on the Fir&s;t-day, and &s;o to the quarterly meeting for Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, held at Cheltenham. As it was the &s;ea&s;on for drinking the water of this place, many who were in it on that account, attended the publick meeting, unto whom the te&s;timony of
<PB N="264" REF="034371_0264_0FFC2FC488D3CBD0">
Truth was declared. From Cheltenham we proceeded to Pain&s;wick, attended a large meet|ing, held on account of the funeral of a friend, which was a favoured opportunity, and had al&s;o a meeting &s;elect with the friends of that place. I had a de&s;ire to have a meeting at Glouce&s;ter with the people not profe&s;&s;ing with us, of which notice was given; and although it was not &s;o large as I wi&s;hed, I had &s;ome open &s;ervice among&s;t tho&s;e who attended and behav|ed &s;eriou&s;ly. We vi&s;ited friends at Tewk&s;bu|ry, and on the Fir&s;t-day, had an appointed meeting at Stoke Orchard, where formerly there had been an e&s;tabli&s;hed meeting of friends, returned to Tewk&s;bury, and next day went to Worce&s;ter. Thence my companion returned to Bri&s;tol, being de&s;irous to &s;pend a little time at home before the yearly meeting at Hereford. On the next Fir&s;t-day, being the 10th of the Ninth month, I attended a large, and I hope a &s;erviceable, meeting at Stourport; which was appointed and attended by John Town&s;end of London, and Thomas Waring of Leomin&s;ter; and was the fir&s;t meet|ing which had been held by Friends in that place.</P>
<P>My mind not being ea&s;y re&s;pecting Bewdley, I propo&s;ed to the before-mentioned friends, to accompany me in a meeting there; which they being willing to do, one was appointed to be held the next morning; and although it was not &s;o large as I expected, it was a favoured &s;ea&s;on, and tended to the relief of my mind.
<PB N="265" REF="034371_0265_0FFC2FC261F78A98">
The 12th, John Town&s;end accompanied me to Droitwich, where I de&s;ired to have a meeting with the town's people, which proved a me|morable &s;ea&s;on of Divine favour. The 13th, I went to Bramyard, and the 14th attended the monthly meeting at Leomin&s;ter, and &s;taid with my relations there until the 23d. On the 21&s;t, the marriage of my niece Catharine Young, with George C. Fox of Falmouth, was &s;olemnized; and the meeting held upon the occa&s;ion was large, and the te&s;timony of Truth was exalted therein, to the Lord's prai&s;e.</P>
<P>From Leomin&s;ter I proceeded to Hereford, where I was met by my companion L. Hawk&s;|worth, and many other mini&s;tering friends and others, a&s;&s;embled to attend the Circular yearly meeting, which was a large, &s;olemn, and (to my&s;elf, and many other friends) humbling &s;ea|&s;on, under the &s;en&s;e of the fre&s;h extendings of Divine love and power towards Friends, and the people of other religious &s;ocieties. How frequently is the a&s;&s;ent of the judgment given to the truths preached in our meetings, by many who attend them, who do not pro|fe&s;s with us! But how few of the&s;e walk an|&s;werably to what they have been convinced is con&s;i&s;tent with the holy di&s;pen&s;ation of Chri&s;t! Alas! the cro&s;s appears too great to be taken up, even to gain an immortal crown. But be it con&s;idered who it was that &s;aid,
<Q>He that taketh not up his cro&s;s, and follow|eth after me, is not worthy of me;</Q>
and
<PB N="266" REF="034371_0266_0FFC2FC0AECD6E18">
al&s;o,
<Q>He that is a&s;hamed of me, and of my doctrine, of him will I be a&s;hamed before my Father and his holy angels.</Q>
It is not only the unfaithfulne&s;s of many who have been born and educated among&s;t us, but that of very many, who have been convinced of the truth of our religious principles, which pre|vents the increa&s;e of our numbers. There was a time when many people were weary of wor&s;hipping in the outward courts of religion, and could not content them&s;elves with &s;hadows of it, and were willing to embrace the cro&s;s, that they might obtain the &s;ub&s;tance; when many great and di&s;tingui&s;hed per&s;ons and cha|racters, bore te&s;timony to the Truth as it is profe&s;&s;ed by us, as they were thereto called of God; who&s;e light &s;hone brightly, and very con&s;picuou&s;ly through their great and nume|rous &s;ufferings, for their
<Q>te&s;timony of a good con&s;cience towards Him and men.</Q>
The pre&s;ent time is a &s;ea&s;on of ea&s;e, and greater liberty to wor&s;hip the Lord agreeably to the in&s;truction of his pure Spirit; but wherein many of the people are willing to hear, but few are awfully inquiring "What is Truth," with an earne&s;t de&s;ire to know, and &s;incere in|tention to follow it. Pontius Pilate inquired, "What is Truth," but did not wait for an an&s;wer from the Light of Truth. He was in part convinced of his power and purity, yet he delivered him up to the Jews to be cruci|fied, le&s;t his temporal intere&s;ts &s;hould &s;uffer, if he re&s;cued him from their malice. And we
<PB N="267" REF="034371_0267_0FFC2FBDDFB7B0A0">
read,
<Q>That the &s;ame day Pilate and Herod were made friends,</Q>
who had before been at variance with each other. Thus it has been, and is, with many who have been part|ly convinced what is Truth. Temporal inter|e&s;ts and plea&s;ures have been preferred to a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in the Truth; and the joining with the world in per&s;ecuting Chri&s;t, to the confe&s;|&s;ing of him before men. The te&s;timony of his &s;ervant is fulfilled in &s;uch;
<Q>Who&s;oever will be a friend of the world, is the enemy of God.</Q>
The&s;e will one day &s;ee and la|ment their great lo&s;s. May the Lord in his mercy rou&s;e many of them to con&s;ider the things which will make for their peace with him, before they are for ever hid from their eyes. I believe there will come a &s;haking time in the&s;e favoured nations, wherein the fal&s;e re&s;t of many will be di&s;turbed, and the judgments of the Lord being in the earth, the inhabitants thereof will learn righteou&s;ne&s;s; and many will be gathered from the barren mountains of an empty profe&s;&s;ion of religion, and the de&s;o|late hills of formality, to &s;it under the teaching of Chri&s;t, manife&s;ted by his Spirit in their &s;ouls, and delight in the extendings of the wing of his love and power; whereby they will be &s;olaced, and &s;heltered in this &s;tate of probation, and therefore &s;ing &s;alvation and &s;trength thereto. O! that tho&s;e remaining under our name may be concerned to keep their lamps burning; that they may attract the notice of tho&s;e who in that day will &s;incerely

that &s;uch may behold us, as a cho&s;en people of God, abiding in our tents, under the direction of our holy Captain, Chri&s;t Je&s;us: who rai&s;ed us up to be a people, that &s;hould bear an uniform te&s;timony to his pure everla&s;ting Truth. He clean&s;ed us from all the chaff and dro&s;s, which under a religious &s;hew, remained among&s;t the profe&s;&s;ors of faith in him; as well as from all the fragments of the legal di&s;pen&s;ation, which with its ordinan|ces and ceremonies were appointed to pa&s;s away, when his pure &s;piritual di&s;pen&s;ation of grace and truth &s;hould be introduced and e&s;ta|bli&s;hed. He &s;tripped us of that fragment of &s;uper&s;tition wherewith the nominal Chri&s;tian church was, and yet is in degree, clothed. He aboli&s;hed the fal&s;e faiths and fal&s;e tru&s;ts whereon many had depended; and he clothed us with that true faith, which overcometh the world, and is productive of fruits meet for his holy kingdom. And will he &s;uffer us to become extinct as a peculiar family to him&s;elf? Nay, verily. Although many of us are as
<Q>degenerate plants of a &s;trange vine unto him;</Q>
he will return and vi&s;it them, and &s;ome of the&s;e will be ingrafted into him; and others will be brought from far, to &s;eek an inheritance among&s;t them; and the Mo&s;t High will acknowledge them, as

<P>I have the more particularly noted my pro|ceedings in this journey, becau&s;e it was among&s;t my friends and others who had here|tofore &s;o largely &s;hared my labours; and this being the la&s;t vi&s;it which I paid them &s;o general|ly, it appeared to me &s;ingular, that I &s;hould fall
<PB N="270" REF="034371_0270_0FFC2FB7E1FB2C48">
in with &s;o many quarterly and annual meetings; which afforded us an opportunity of &s;eeing each other more generally and repeatedly than we &s;hould have done, had it not &s;o happened: and be it commemorated with humble thankfulne&s;s to the merciful Fountain of ble&s;&s;ings, that it was a &s;ea&s;on of &s;ignal favour to many of our &s;pirits.</P>
<P>I had been laboriou&s;ly exerci&s;ed for more than five months in this journey, and except in attending our monthly and quarterly meeting, and occa&s;ional &s;ervices about home, I was ex|cu&s;ed from travelling more in this year. In|deed, I had for &s;ome time, found my nature &s;inking under the load of exerci&s;es it had long &s;u&s;tained; &s;o that I did not go through &s;ervices a&s;&s;igned me without many painful feelings, but He who employed, &s;upported me, to the prai&s;e of his ever worthy Name.</P>
<P>In the &s;pring of the year 1781, I wrote my brother Young to the following import:&mdash; 'My mind is &s;o clo&s;ed in regard to future pro&s;|pects of duty, that I am ready to conclude, that &s;ome family affliction may prevent my mov|ing far from home &s;oon.'</P>
<P>In this I was not mi&s;taken; for &s;oon after I wrote that letter I was &s;eized with a cold, the effects whereof became alarming; and after its load was removed from my lungs, it fell upon my joints, which have gradually &s;tiffened, and baffled all medical application; &s;o that I am be|come an entire cripple, and my fingers are &s;o contracted that my being able to u&s;e my pen is
<PB N="271" REF="034371_0271_0FFC2FB577F030C0">
admirable to my friends. But although this is ultimately the con&s;equence, yet I have been enabled to &s;truggle on for &s;everal years.</P>
<P>I was not &s;o recovered as to appear equal to the fatigue of attending the yearly meeting at London this year; and my hu&s;band al&s;o was ea&s;y to abide at home, where he was &s;o dan|gerou&s;ly attacked with a quin&s;ey, that it ap|peared he very narrowly e&s;caped death. His &s;on was from home, and the weight of his criti|cal &s;ituation, together with the attention which was due to him, bore heavily upon my weak body and &s;pirits, and but that our cou&s;in Fran|ces James, now Fox, was then with us, I know not how I &s;hould have &s;u&s;tained my fatigues. She very tenderly and a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly attended up|on my hu&s;band, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted me in this &s;ea&s;on of affliction; which I note with thankfulne&s;s to that good Hand which furni&s;hed us with her help. My hu&s;band's fir&s;t wife was her mo|ther's &s;i&s;ter, and &s;he being left an infant or|phan, my hu&s;band, with other relations, had cared for her, and a mutual affection &s;ub&s;i&s;ted; &s;o that her &s;ervices were the more willingly lent, and plea&s;ingly accepted.</P>
<P>When my hu&s;band's di&s;order was turned, he recovered &s;trength but &s;lowly, and I conti|nued weak, yet I could not be ea&s;y to omit at|tending the Circular yearly meeting, which was this year held at South Molton in Devon&s;hire. My hu&s;band's health not admitting of his ac|companying me, my niece Fox was my only companion; but being in our own chai&s;e we
<PB N="272" REF="034371_0272_0FFC2FB29B34DFD0">
got along the more ea&s;ily and in &s;afety to South Molton, where we hoped to have met my bro|thers Payton and Young; but in this we were afflictingly di&s;appointed. My brother's &s;ervant brought us intelligence, that his ma&s;ter and my brother Young had come within one &s;tage of Bri&s;tol, where my brother Young was laid up extremely ill; and of con&s;equence my bro|ther Payton was detained with him. This was afflicting intelligence to us both; my niece his daughter was &s;unk too low to proceed forward alone; and until the meeting clo&s;ed, no friend could be expected to accompany her, when my friend Hawk&s;worth took her under her care. She found her father extremely ill, and his ca&s;e appeared for &s;ome time very danger|ous, yet it plea&s;ed Providence to re&s;tore him; but he was confined &s;ome weeks at the inn, be|fore it appeared &s;afe for him to move forwards.</P>
<P>The people of South Molton very kindly welcomed friends among&s;t them, and freely opened their hou&s;es to receive &s;uch as could not be accommodated with lodgings at the inns. My friend Hawk&s;worth and my&s;elf pre|ferred lodging at a private hou&s;e, as our inn was likely to be very full of company; and as we went to &s;ee a room at a con&s;iderable di&s;|tance, a young clergyman joined us, and ap|peared to intere&s;t him&s;elf in our being well ac|commodated. He told us the people of the town were generally moderate and civil, and &s;eemed plea&s;ed that the meeting was appointed there. We were kindly lodged near the inn.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="034371_0273_0FFC2FB0F6E27DC8">The meeting was very large, and the peo|ple behaved &s;oberly: indeed many of them &s;eemed prepared to receive, or at lea&s;t hear, the te&s;timony of Truth; and the power of it &s;o prevailed in the meeting as to bind down the &s;pirits of others, who might attend from no better motive than curio&s;ity. The &s;pring of go&s;pel mini&s;try ran freely, and I, though &s;o weak, was enabled to take a large &s;hare in the labour. Friends were comforted together, and the faithful among&s;t them rejoiced in perceiving the extendings of the love of God, both to|wards the members of our own &s;ociety, and tho&s;e of other religious profe&s;&s;ions; many of who&s;e hearts were affected under the te&s;timo|nies delivered in the meetings.</P>
<P>I returned directly home, my friend A. Price accompanying me. Here, and in the county, I continued for the winter, in a weak &s;tate of health, and my dear hu&s;band tender, but mo&s;t|ly cheerful, which was his natural di&s;po&s;ition. I do not know that I have enjoyed one day's health &s;ince the &s;pring of this year, which, as I fore&s;aw, was a year attended with much fa|mily affliction, wherein our &s;on Richard Phil|lips had a &s;hare before it terminated.</P>
<P>In the year 1782, I attended the Welch yearly meeting, which was held at Bridge|north. My hu&s;band accompanied me to Bri&s;|tol, and Lydia Hawk&s;worth went with me to Bridgenorth. We went direct, only called and &s;taid a &s;hort time with my brother, and re|turned
<PB N="274" REF="034371_0274_0FFC2FAE6D0EBAA0">
to the yearly meeting at Bri&s;tol, and thence to London.</P>
<P>When I went from Bri&s;tol to Bridgenorth, my hu&s;band went to Swan&s;ea, and met me in London, to attend the yearly meeting there. A general epidemic cold reigned during the &s;itting of the yearly meeting. Many friends were &s;eized with it, but we were favoured to e&s;cape it, until much of the &s;ervice of the meetings was over. We were both much in|di&s;po&s;ed, which detained us &s;ome time in Lon|don; and when we were able to travel, we returned with our friend Lydia Hawk&s;worth to Bri&s;tol, and thence home. We recovered &s;trength to attend the Circular yearly meeting, which was held at Tamworth in the Ninth month. My weakne&s;s and contraction in my joints increa&s;ing, my hu&s;band con&s;ulted Dr. Ludlow, a phy&s;ician of note of Bri&s;tol, upon the ca&s;e, who ordered me medicine to take on the journey, which, being of an invigorating quality, I thought helped to &s;trengthen me to get through the fatigue of the journey, and the exerci&s;e of the meeting; although the principal help in the cour&s;e of the labour a&s;|&s;igned me therein mu&s;t be attributed to the Lord's power, which is manife&s;ted in the weak|ne&s;s of his &s;ervants. The meeting was large, both of Friends and tho&s;e of other &s;ocieties, and crowned with the Divine pre&s;ence. The te&s;timony of Truth was exalted, and faithful friends were comforted, in the &s;en&s;e of the continued extendings of the heavenly Father's
<PB N="275" REF="034371_0275_0FFC2FAC2E0BC3F8">
love to the various &s;tates of the members of our own &s;ociety, as well as to other profe&s;&s;ors of religion. Before the meeting was opened I had di&s;located my left elbow, by a fall down a &s;teep and long flight of &s;tairs, and was oblig|ed to carry my arm in a &s;ling; although I had to take &s;o con&s;iderable a &s;hare of active labour through the cour&s;e of the meetings. After their conclu&s;ion, we attended a meeting at Birmingham, then &s;pent a &s;hort time at Dud|ley, with my brother, and returned to Bri&s;tol, where we again con&s;ulted Dr. Ludlow; who advi&s;ed me to try the effect of electricity on my contracted joints. After I had continued &s;ome time under that operation, he ordered me to Bath, to try the effect of pumping upon them, at the &s;ame time continuing the medicines he had pre&s;cribed. But all was without the de|&s;ired effect; and indeed I believe the Doctor had but little hope in my ca&s;e, for he intimat|ed that I might probably become an entire cripple, and live many years in that &s;tate: which has been my ca&s;e.</P>
<P>1783.&mdash;My hu&s;band accompanied me to the yearly meeting at London. Before I left home, I had informed my friends that I was engaged to attend the yearly meetings of Colche&s;ter, Woodbridge, and Norwich, which &s;ucceeded that at London; and had obtained a certificate of their unity with me therein; and my friend Lydia Hawk&s;worth being under the like con|cern, we left Bri&s;tol on the 28th of the Fifth month, accompanied by our friend Mary Were
<PB N="276" REF="034371_0276_0FFC2FA8C1278C28">
of Wellington. We proceeded to Melk&s;ham and Sali&s;bury, where we left Mary Were, and went to Poole, attended the meetings there on Fir&s;t-day, 1&s;t of Sixth month, and the 2d, met Mary Were at Ringwood, at|tended the monthly meeting there, and pro|ceeded to Rum&s;ey, thence to Alton, attended the week-day meeting there on the 4th, and went to Godalming, and the 5th to London. On this day we intended to have fallen in with the week-day meeting at E&s;her; but there be|ing a funeral of a friend at King&s;ton, mo&s;t of the friends of E&s;her were gone to attend it; &s;o we pre&s;&s;ed on, and got to the meeting a little after the time appointed; and I hope it was well we were there. We attended the quarterly meeting, and proceeded on our jour|ney, taking meetings in our way to the before|mentioned yearly meetings. We al&s;o vi&s;ited almo&s;t all the meetings in Norfolk, then pa&s;&s;ed into Cambridge&s;hire and the I&s;le of Ely, vi&s;it|ing the meetings therein, thence into E&s;&s;ex, and, vi&s;iting divers meetings which I had not before attended in that county, turned back through Cambridge&s;hire to Huntingdon. In this journey I &s;u&s;tained much labour both in body and &s;pirit, which was the more painful from my increa&s;ed and increa&s;ing weakne&s;s; which rendered it probable, as indeed it prov|ed, that this would be the la&s;t vi&s;it I &s;hould pay to friends of tho&s;e parts; as it was al&s;o the fir&s;t I had paid to many of the meetings which we attended. I was however thankful
<PB N="277" REF="034371_0277_0FFC2FA727753240">
that the good Shepherd influenced our minds to vi&s;it &s;o many of his &s;heep in tho&s;e counties, unto whom our &s;pirits were united in go&s;pel &s;ympathy; and we had al&s;o to bear the burden of the &s;pirits of formal profe&s;&s;ors, unto whom the alarm was &s;ounded, to awake out of &s;leep. I had &s;ome publick meetings in this journey to my &s;atisfaction, and I hope to the edification of many people attending them. One of them was held at Cambridge; which I hope was &s;erviceable, although I was not favoured to ri&s;e in the exerci&s;e of the Divine gift be|&s;towed upon me, to that height I did when in that town many years ago.</P>
<P>That was indeed a &s;ingular time, and an|&s;wered a &s;ingular end, viz. to convince a man who had contemned women's mini&s;try in Chri&s;t's church, of its weight, efficacy, and con&s;i&s;tency with the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation. The &s;ame man, who did not live in the town, was invited to attend this meeting, and he might therein hear go&s;pel truths publi&s;hed, and treat|ed upon in a more argumentative way, than it was common for me to be engaged in. The All-wi&s;e employer of true go&s;pel mini&s;ters knows how to direct his &s;ervants, both as to the matter, and the manner wherein he intends it &s;hould be communicated to the people. And I have admired his wi&s;dom and conde&s;cen&s;ion therein, when without forethought my &s;peech has been accommodated to the capacities of tho&s;e unto whom it was directed. To &s;uch as were illiterate and ignorant, I have &s;poken in very
<PB N="278" REF="034371_0278_0FFC2FA4D0742C68">
low terms; and to tho&s;e of more under&s;tand|ing, in &s;uch as an&s;wered its level; while to the learned, and tho&s;e of &s;uperior natural abi|lities, I might &s;ay with the prophet,
<Q>The Lord God hath given me the tongue of the learned;</Q>
although I had it not by educati|on. I have not wanted eloquence of &s;peech, or &s;trength of argument, wherein to convey and enforce the doctrines given me to preach; of which I could &s;ay, as my Lord and Ma&s;ter did,
<Q>My doctrines are not mine, but his who &s;ent me:</Q>
and his love, life, and pow|er, hath accompanied them, to the &s;topping of the mouths of gain&s;ayers, and convincing of the under&s;tandings of many, of the recti|tude and efficacy of
<Q>the Truth as it is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</Q></P>
<P>O the depth and excellency of true go&s;pel mini&s;try! The Lord's prophet in the pro&s;pect of it might well exclaim,
<Q>How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of tho&s;e who bring good tidings, who publi&s;h peace, who publi&s;h &s;alvation, who &s;ay unto Zion, Thy God reigneth!</Q>
The&s;e are not made &s;o by human or literary acquirements; but
<Q>the Spirit from on high being poured upon them,</Q>
under its holy humbling influence they are enabled to mini&s;ter, and
<Q>compare &s;piritual things with &s;piritual,</Q>
or elucidate them by natural things, as occa&s;ion may re|quire, without foreca&s;t or premeditation; for they &s;peak extempore, as the Spirit giveth ut|terance. When the mini&s;try in the general
<PB N="279" REF="034371_0279_0FFC2FA26BEB9378">
thus returns to its original dignity and &s;impli|city, an education at colleges will not be &s;ought to qualify for it. No, tho&s;e who are accou|tred for the &s;ervice of him
<Q>who &s;poke as ne|ver man &s;pake,</Q>
mu&s;t be educated in his &s;chool, and di&s;ciplined by his wi&s;dom; where|by they are made able mini&s;ters of the new te&s;tament, not of the letter but of the &s;pirit; for the letter killeth but the &s;pirit giveth life.</P>
<P>Thus have I, with many of my fellow-la|bourers, been a&s;&s;i&s;ted to mini&s;ter in the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t; and now in the clo&s;e of a labori|ous day's work, I may commemorate the mer|cy, power, and wi&s;dom of Him who chu&s;eth whom he plea&s;eth for the various offices in his church. He appoints, of both male and fe|male,
<Q>&s;ome apo&s;tles, &s;ome prophets, &s;ome evangeli&s;ts, and &s;ome pa&s;tors and teachers; for the perfecting of the &s;aints, for the wo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters"> of the mini&s;try, for the edifying of the body of Chri&s;t; until his members come in the unity of the faith, and of the know|ledge of the Son of God, unto the mea|&s;ure of the &s;tature of the fullne&s;s of Chri&s;t; and may grow up into him in all things who is the Head, from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint &s;upplieth, according to its effectual working in the mea&s;ure of every part, maketh increa&s;e of the body, unto the edifying of it&s;elf in love.</Q>
Then, there is the highe&s;t rejoicing in him the heavenly Teacher, who fulfils his gracious promi&s;e,
<PB N="280" REF="034371_0280_0FFC2FA0E1FE7FD8">
both to tho&s;e who mini&s;ter under him, and to tho&s;e who are not called to this awful &s;ervice,
<Q>Lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the world!</Q></P>
<P>Unto him all true go&s;pel mini&s;ters direct the people, and endeavour to &s;ettle them under the teaching of his pure Spirit. The&s;e di&s;claim the lea&s;t degree of ability to labour availingly in his &s;ervice, except what flows from him, the fountain of Divine power, love, and life; and, after they have done and &s;uffered what he a&s;&s;igns them. &s;it down in the acknowledg|ment, that
<Q>what they are, they are through his grace.</Q>
And thanking him that they have not received his grace in vain, humbly confe&s;s they have done but their duty. Thus from early youth, have I travelled and labour|ed, that the &s;aving knowledge of God may increa&s;e, through experience of the prevalence of the power of his Son; whereby the true believers in him become crucified to the world and the world unto them; and being th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters"> dead, are rai&s;ed by him in newne&s;s of life, to the prai&s;e and glory of God. Freely I have received the knowledge of &s;alvation through the &s;anctifying operation of the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t; and freely have I te&s;tified thereof, and of God's univer&s;al love through his Son to mankind: for he would have none to peri&s;h, but that all &s;hould be &s;aved, and attain to the knowledge of his Truth.</P>
<P>My views, with tho&s;e of others my fellow-labourers in the mini&s;try, have, in regard to
<PB N="281" REF="034371_0281_0FFC2F9E05B05450">
our&s;elves, been &s;imply to obtain peace with God through an hone&s;t di&s;charge of our duty; and in re&s;pect to tho&s;e unto whom we have freely mini&s;tered, that they might be turned from darkne&s;s to light, and from the power of Satan unto God; and be favoured with the experience of the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, and obtain|ing a fixed inheritance among&s;t all tho&s;e who are &s;anctified. And we are not afraid to &s;ay, that the love of Chri&s;t hath con&s;trained us to mini&s;ter, unmixed with any temporal intere&s;t|ed motive, or view of reward. Through that love, we have been made willing to &s;pend our temporal &s;ub&s;tance, as well as our &s;trength of body and of faculties, and to &s;uffer many hard|&s;hips; yea, to leave what was deare&s;t to us in nature, and be accounted fools by the wi&s;e and prudent of this world; &s;ome of whom have poured upon us contempt, but who profe&s;&s;ing them&s;elves to be wife, have manife&s;ted their fooli&s;hne&s;s; and by &s;peaking evil of what they knew not, have evidently been wi&s;e in their own conceits.</P>
<P>As to us, however we may have been fa|voured by the Lord, who has accounted us worthy to have a part in this mini&s;try, and has at &s;ea&s;ons clothed us as with a royal robe, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of even tho&s;e who have had us in deri&s;ion; all boa&s;ting is excluded, by the pure humbling law of faith in Chri&s;t,
<Q>the wi&s;dom and power of God,</Q>
and we con|fe&s;s with his primitive mini&s;ters, that we have nothing of our own to boa&s;t of but infirmities,
<PB N="282" REF="034371_0282_0FFC2F9C6A594730">
nor have we ought to glory in but his grace to help us; through which we have been render|ed equal to the arduous ta&s;ks a&s;&s;igned us; and willing to turn from pro&s;pects the mo&s;t plea&s;ing to the natural mind, and to endure cro&s;&s;es, tri|bulations, and the contempt of men, for his &s;ake, who &s;o loved us as to die for us; and hath mercifully called us by his grace, to be|come heirs with him in the kingdom of his Fa|ther: and having done all, we have nothing to tru&s;t in but the mercy of God, manife&s;ted in and through him; and under a &s;en&s;e that all we can do to promote his honour is but lit|tle, and that little communicated by his &s;trength, this is ultimately the language of our &s;pirits. Not unto us, O Lord! not unto us, but unto thy ever worthy name, or power, be glory forever! Amen.</P>
<P>From Cambridge, one of the &s;eats of learn|ing, I wi&s;h I could &s;ay of piety, we proceeded to vi&s;it &s;ome other meetings in this quarter, and coming to Ives, attended the funeral of Samuel Abbot, an elder of good report. The meeting held upon the occa&s;ion was extremely crowded, and many of the principal inhabit|ants of the town and neighbourhood attended it. It was a &s;ea&s;on of awful &s;olemnity, where|in the tide of go&s;pel mini&s;try ro&s;e high, even to the overflowing the mounds of oppo&s;ition; and I believe the people were &s;o humbled, that many of them could join us in &s;upplication and prai&s;e to the Lord, who
<Q>is glorious in holi|ne&s;s, fearful in prai&s;es, working wonders.</Q>
<PB N="283" REF="034371_0283_0FFC2F9A468C3560">
Hence we went (as before hinted) to Hunting|don, our friend John Abbot (&s;on to the friend who&s;e funeral we had attended) accompanying us. From Huntingdon we proceeded to Amp|thill in Bedford&s;hire; and in our way pa&s;&s;ed through Potton, intending, if it was conveni|ent, to lodge in that town, with one profe&s;&s;ing with us. But alas! when we came there, we found the town, which the day before, had been, it was &s;aid, one of the prettie&s;t in the county, in ruins. A terrible fire had raged all night, and was not then in &s;ome places quite extingui&s;hed. Almo&s;t the whole of a principal &s;treet, through which we walked (not without fear le&s;t the chimnies, or &s;ome other parts of the brick or &s;tone-work left &s;tanding, &s;hould fall upon us), and mo&s;t of the hou&s;es in the market-place were con&s;umed. The fire &s;topped at the next hou&s;e to that which our friend had inhabited. He had time to get his goods out, but had left them, and with his wife was gone to another town where they had relations, and through which we had to pa&s;s, and where, at an inn, we lodged at night, our friend Abbot accompanying us. The view of Potton and its inhabitants was truly pitiable: the goods of the &s;ufferers were &s;cattered about round the town in the fields, and &s;ome were watching them. The countenances of &s;ome whom we &s;aw in the &s;treets were deeply marked with grief; and the principal ovens being de&s;troyed, bread was to be fetched from a town &s;ome miles di&s;tant. Our friend John Abbot was &s;o
<PB N="284" REF="034371_0284_0FFC2F980A8FC7F8">
touched with the countenance of one poor woman, that after pa&s;&s;ing her, he turned back, and gave her &s;omething hand&s;ome; but &s;he probably knew not where to buy victuals if &s;he wanted it. The principal inns being burn|ed down or greatly injured, we &s;topped at the hou&s;e of an acquaintance of his, in a part of the town which had e&s;caped the fire, who rea|dily gave us &s;ome refre&s;hment; and in return, we left with him, towards the pre&s;ent relief of the &s;ufferers, &s;o much as excited his thank|fulne&s;s. The next morning we vi&s;ited our friends who had fled from Potton, at their re|lation's; and had a &s;olemn religious opportu|nity with them and others pre&s;ent; and pro|ceeding to Ampthill, attended the Fir&s;t-day's meetings there. From Ampthill, John Abbot returned home, and we went pretty directly to Melk&s;ham, appointing &s;ome meetings in our way thither. Before I came there my &s;trength was extremely exhau&s;ted, and having a con|cern to attend the Circular yearly meeting to be held at Frome in Somer&s;et&s;hire, it appeared nece&s;&s;ary for me previou&s;ly to take a little re&s;t. We therefore &s;taid at Melk&s;ham with my af|fectionate relations Elizabeth Fowler and her &s;on and daughter, her hu&s;band being now dead. At Frome, I met with my dear brother James Payton, and many of my relations and friends, and the Lord favoured us together with his pre&s;ence. The meetings were large, &s;olemn, and eminently crowned with divine life and power, wherein the go&s;pel was preach|ed
<PB N="285" REF="034371_0285_0FFC2F9534BFB538">
by &s;everal mini&s;ters. Nicholas Waln, from Penn&s;ylvania, attended this meeting, and had acceptable &s;ervice therein. I went directly home; and in my way had a favoured meeting with friends, and many others of the inhabi|tants of Exeter. My niece Fox accompanied me from Frome to Truro, where my dear hu&s;band met me, to our mutual thankfulne&s;s. I do not recollect any thing more worth re|marking in the remainder of this year, where|in I continued weak, yet attended &s;ervices about home as they occurred.</P>
<P>In the &s;pring of the year 1784, my dear hu&s;band was much indi&s;po&s;ed, and from that time was frequently afflicted with a giddine&s;s in his head; yet he recovered &s;o far as to at|tend the yearly meeting at London, and I ac|companied him in much weakne&s;s; yet I had cau&s;e to be humbly thankful for the Divine aid vouch&s;afed to labour, although I was un|able to attend all the meetings which were held in the cour&s;e of that &s;olemnity.</P>
<P>From London we went to Bri&s;tol, where my hu&s;band had bu&s;ine&s;s; and as I had no in|clination to &s;tay in that city, proceeded in company with M. and A. Moon, to Welling|ton. Thence I was accompanied by my dear friend M. Were to William Byrd's at Uff|culm; at who&s;e hou&s;e we had a favoured meet|ing with the town's people, and returned to Wellington; where I waited, until my hu&s;band came to me. I was &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed with a concern to pay a vi&s;it once more to the few
<PB N="286" REF="034371_0286_0FFC2F9362F0B3C0">
profe&s;&s;ing Truth in the north &s;ide of Devon&s;hire, as well as to hold &s;ome publick meetings in &s;ome of the towns which I had heretofore vi&s;it|ed. My hu&s;band knew of my having this pro&s;pect, but when he came to me at Welling|ton, and &s;aw how poorly I was, he almo&s;t feared for me, and would have been plea&s;ed if I had been ea&s;y to have accompanied him directly home. This however not being the ca&s;e, we went on the Fir&s;t-day to Friends meeting at Spice-land, which was attended by a pretty many &s;ober people, not profe&s;&s;ing with us; and the Ma&s;ter of our a&s;&s;emblies, favoured with &s;uitable doctrine and coun&s;el, &s;o that the truly righteous rejoiced together; and, under the &s;en&s;e of the arm of the Lord being extended to help in the &s;ea&s;ons of weakne&s;s, we pro|ceeded from this meeting to South Molton; and our friends Nicholas and Mary Were, and William and Ann Byrd, accompanied us; as did al&s;o Thomas Melhui&s;h of Taunton. We appointed a meeting to be held there the next morning; but the weather proving very wet, there was &s;ome doubt how it would be attend|ed; however it was pretty large, and a &s;o|lemn in&s;tructive &s;ea&s;on. No one profe&s;&s;ing with us lived in this town, nor had any meet|ing been appointed there &s;ince the Circular meeting was held there in 1781. But the re|membrance and &s;avour of that &s;olemnity might continue long upon the minds of religious per&s;ons.</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="034371_0287_0FFC2F9135B1B658">We went that evening to Barn&s;taple (except T. Melhui&s;h, who returned home), and next day had a meeting there in the A&s;&s;embly-room, which was large, &s;olemn, and highly favour|ed with the Divine power and pre&s;ence. I was wonderfully a&s;&s;i&s;ted to publi&s;h go&s;pel truths,
<Q>in the demon&s;tration of the &s;pirit, and with power;</Q>
and it appeared that many who heard, under&s;tood and were affected, among&s;t whom were &s;ome of the higher rank. O! that &s;uch heavenly vi&s;itations might produce fruits of righteou&s;ne&s;s an&s;werable to the la|bour be&s;towed; but alas! they are too fre|quently like water &s;pilled upon a &s;tone, which although it wets the &s;urface, does not change the obdurate unfruitful nature of the &s;tone; and the rain which has de&s;cended upon it, is &s;o quickly dried up, that there remains no evi|dence of its having been watered.</P>
<P>Indeed the &s;tone is, agreeable to its nature, unfruitful, and mu&s;t remain &s;o. But what &s;aid the apo&s;tle unto tho&s;e who&s;e hearts were like ground, which, although it was often water|ed, brought forth nothing more profitable than briers and thorns.
<Q>It is nigh unto cur&s;ing, who&s;e end is to be burned.</Q></P>
<P>It is extremely dangerous trifling with the Lord's merciful vi&s;itation to the &s;oul, as time is uncertain: therefore tho&s;e who hear, have need to be concerned to obey the call of God to a renovation of mind and manners, that their &s;ouls may live.</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="034371_0288_0FFC2F8F0330AE50">From Barn&s;taple, we went to Great Torring|ton, and had a large and I hope &s;erviceable meeting there, although not &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hedly favoured as that of Barn&s;taple had been. My dear friends A. Byrd and M. Were had acceptable &s;ervice in the before-menti|oned meetings; as well as in mini&s;tering to the few friends who were &s;cattered about the country, who met us at one place or other; and we had private religious opportunities with them, &s;o that they were generally vi&s;ited. I was favoured with much freedom to &s;peak to them in the love of Chri&s;t, and therein to take my farewel of them; for this proved to be my la&s;t vi&s;it. There were never many friends &s;ettled on the north &s;ide of Devon&s;hire. I know not of a meeting-hou&s;e having been built in any town I have vi&s;ited there; yet a few, &s;ome of them having been gathered from other profe&s;|&s;ions of religion, were &s;cattered about in this quarter, and held meetings at their hou&s;es.</P>
<P>W. Byrd and his wife left us at Torring|ton; but Nicholas Were and his wife conclud|ed to accompany us to Hatherly, twelve miles farther, where I had a de&s;ire to have a meet|ing; and their being &s;o di&s;po&s;ed proved very &s;erviceable to us.</P>
<P>There having been a large fair for cattle the day before we came to Hatherly, and the far|mers &s;carcely all gone from the place, we found the inn in &s;uch di&s;order as to render it doubt|ful how we &s;hould lodge. However, the land|lady
<PB N="289" REF="034371_0289_0FFC2F8C0FC1D810">
got clean linen, and our friends Were and our&s;elves got lodging; but &s;ome men friends who met us from Exon, were obliged to &s;hift for them&s;elves as well as they could; and a young woman who accompanied them was pro|vided for with us. The town was &s;mall, and in &s;uch a hurry, that it appeared a poor time to get a meeting. The weather was al&s;o very wet on this and the next day; but &s;ome of the town's people being informed of our view in coming, intere&s;ted them&s;elves in procuring us a meeting place, and we were furni&s;hed with one as commodious as we could expect. Many a&s;|&s;i&s;ted to &s;eat a part of it; and the weather con|tinuing wet, prevented &s;ome of the inhabitants from going to their labour, &s;o that I know not but our meeting was the larger through that circum&s;tance. The people behaved well, ma|ny were content to &s;tand, and we were favour|ed with a &s;olemn meeting among&s;t them. No meeting had been held in this place for very many years; &s;o that mo&s;t of our auditors ap|peared ignorant of our religious principles and manner of wor&s;hip; but our vi&s;it was received with expre&s;&s;ions of plea&s;ure and gratitude by &s;ome, and we left the place with thankful hearts, each of us &s;ettiog our faces homeward the &s;ame evening. My health continued de|clining, and my hu&s;band's complaint of giddi|ne&s;s returned pretty frequently. We did not go far from home for the remainder of this year.</P>
<P><PB N="290" REF="034371_0290_0FFC2F89C4B3CFC8">In 1785 my hu&s;band was inclined to attend the yearly meeting at London, and de&s;irous of my accompanying him. I was &s;o weighed down with painful &s;en&s;ations, and my joints &s;o much contracted, and he &s;o &s;ubject to the gid|dine&s;s in his head, that I &s;ugge&s;ted to him the propriety of our con&s;idering whether it was &s;afe for us to venture upon &s;uch a journey: to which he replied, that his mind was &s;trongly drawn to the yearly meeting, and &s;aid, that it would be the la&s;t he &s;hould attend. In our way thereto we were at the meeting of Brid|port on the Fir&s;t-day; and I appointed a meet|ing at Andover, which was large, and emi|nently favoured with the Divine power and pre&s;ence. Samuel Emlen and George Dill|wyn, both of Philadelphia, attended this meet|ing; but the principal &s;hare of the mini&s;try re&s;t|ed upon me: indeed I had long had a view to a meeting in this town, and this proved to be the la&s;t time I pa&s;&s;ed through it. When we reached London, I was in a very weak &s;tate, but was enabled to attend the meetings in their cour&s;e. At the yearly meeting in the preced|ing year, our men-friends had weightily con|&s;idered the &s;tate of our women's yearly meet|ing; and it appearing that it might become of more general &s;ervice, if the queries for women-friends, which are an&s;wered from their month|ly to their quarterly meetings, were al&s;o an|&s;wered from the quarterly to the yearly meeting of women, they &s;ent a minute to the quarterly
<PB N="291" REF="034371_0291_0FFC2F883383CA38">
and monthly meetings to that import; and this year an&s;wers were &s;ent from &s;ome quarterly meet|ings, and women-friends attended as repre&s;en|tatives. But it being a new thing, and the pro|priety or nece&s;&s;ity of it not fully under&s;tood by all our women-friends, an epi&s;tle was written, &s;etting forth the ri&s;e and u&s;e of the di&s;cipline e&s;tabli&s;hed among&s;t us, and encouraging wo|men-friends to attend to their &s;hare of it. As mothers of children and mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of families, they have an exten&s;ive &s;ervice to attend to, and ought to be concerned &s;o to di&s;cipline their fa|milies, as to be able to an&s;wer the &s;everal que|ries relative to their &s;ituation.</P>
<P>My mind being drawn to vi&s;it the quarterly meeting of Hertford&s;hire, I intimated it to my friend Elizabeth Talwyn of Bromley, who kind|ly took me and my dear companion Lydia Hawk&s;worth thereto in her coach; and this was my farewel vi&s;it to Friends there. As I knew that my hu&s;band as well as my&s;elf wi&s;h|ed to leave London as &s;oon as we could with ea&s;e of mind, I reque&s;ted that notice might be &s;ent to the &s;everal meetings near to that of Chorley Wood, that I hoped to be there on the next Fir&s;t-day, and &s;hould be plea&s;ed to &s;ee as many as could meet me there. The meeting-hou&s;e was pretty full, it was a favour|ed &s;ea&s;on, and the la&s;t meeting I had in that part of the kingdom. That night we lodged with our friend Robert Eeles near Amer&s;ham, by whom and his kind wife I had &s;everal times
<PB N="292" REF="034371_0292_0FFC2F86043F3438">
been affectionately entertained. Next day we reached Banbury, had a meeting with friends there, on the next morning, and after taking an affectionate leave of my near relation S. Stone, we proceeded that night to Warwick. My &s;i&s;ter received us affectionately, though not without concern to &s;ee me &s;o much enfee|bled. My joints were &s;o contracted that it was become difficult for me to walk; and through|out this journey I was a&s;&s;i&s;ted in dre&s;&s;ing; and my inward weakne&s;s was al&s;o very apparent, &s;o that it appeared probable that this might be our la&s;t interview, I attended one meeting with friends at Warwick, wherein the Divine &s;pring of go&s;pel mini&s;try was opened to the re|fre&s;hment of religious minds; and, after tak|ing my la&s;t per&s;onal farewel of my dear &s;i&s;ter, we went to Coventry, had an evening meeting there, which was pretty generally attended by friends and &s;ome intelligent people not profe&s;&s;|ing with us; and the Lord favoured us toge|ther in a memorable degree. The &s;ubjects given me to &s;peak upon, were the awfulne&s;s and importance of pa&s;&s;ing through time, con|&s;idering the con&s;equences depending there|upon, and the &s;olemnity of pa&s;&s;ing out of it, even to the be&s;t of men. For although &s;uch might be favoured with a well-grounded hope of participating in
<Q>the inheritance which is undefiled and fadeth not away;</Q>
and might rejoice at the approach of the hour of relea&s;e from the pains and &s;olicitudes attendant in this probationary &s;tate; it was a &s;ea&s;on, wherein,
<PB N="293" REF="034371_0293_0FFA6C95F268E070">
from the con&s;ideration of the purity of Chri&s;t's kingdom, they might think it needful to exa|mine whether their &s;pirits were &s;o clean, as to be meet for admittance thereinto. But to the wicked it was a terrible hour. Many &s;triking remarks, directed to divers &s;tates, were given me to make; and I was favoured to deliver them in conci&s;e, yet &s;trong terms, to the af|fecting the minds of many pre&s;ent: and thus, taking leave of that city, we proceeded next day to Birmingham, attended the Fir&s;t-day meeting there, and thence to Dudley. We &s;taid a few days with my brother, attended one meeting there, and another at Stourbridge, afterwards went to Worce&s;ter, and were at the Fir&s;t-day meetings there.</P>
<P>As my ca&s;e appeared alarming, and &s;ome of my friends advi&s;ed my making trial of Buxton water, my hu&s;band, when we were at Bir|mingham, took the advi&s;e of a phy&s;ician of note, who did not choo&s;e to pre&s;cribe for me, nor encourage my going to Buxton; but advi&s;ed our calling at Bath, but cautioned me again&s;t drinking the waters, or bathing, without tak|ing further advice there: &s;o taking leave of our brother James Payton and friends at Wor|ce&s;ter, we proceeded directly to Bath. The advice I there had was to return home, drink the Bath water there, and pur&s;ue the cour&s;e of medicine pre&s;cribed. The weather was then too hot for me either to bathe, or drink the water there, but it was left to further con|&s;ideration
<PB N="294" REF="034371_0294_0FFC2F8322F15FA0">
whether I &s;hould return there in the fall.</P>
<P>Weak as I was, I had two meetings at Bath; in one of which I had a &s;trong and clear te&s;ti|mony directed to a &s;tate which in youth had been Divinely vi&s;ited, and made &s;ome advances in the path of &s;elf-denial; but in more advanc|ed age, had &s;ought after worldly wi&s;dom and knowledge, and the friend&s;hip of tho&s;e in that &s;pirit, and had lo&s;t the heavenly dew of youth.</P>
<P>There was a per&s;on in the &s;tate de&s;cribed, in the meeting, who was much affected, and died in a &s;hort time. How does Divine mercy fol|low the back&s;liders from his holy command|ment, with the gracious call of
<Q>Turn ye, why will you die?</Q></P>
<P>From Bath, we went to Bri&s;tol, where my hu&s;band had bu&s;ine&s;s, and where I left him, and went to John Hip&s;ley's at Conger&s;bury, was at the meeting of Claverham on the Fir&s;t-day, and returning to Conger&s;bury, &s;taid there until my hu&s;band's bu&s;ine&s;s permitted him to return home: to which we went directly, my|&s;elf in a feeble &s;tate, but my hu&s;band appear|ed to be as well as when we left it.</P>
<P>After our return from London, my hu&s;|band's time and attention were very much en|gro&s;&s;ed by bu&s;ine&s;s relative to the mining in+tere&s;ts in this county. Some alteration in the cour&s;e of the trade appeared nece&s;&s;ary, and as he had from his youth been engaged in the copper trade, and was well acquainted with the &s;tate of it, both in the pa&s;t and pre&s;ent
<PB N="295" REF="034371_0295_0FFC2F816AFE8FB0">
times, much regard was paid to his judgment, by many who attended at the meetings held on the occa&s;ion: and his &s;olicitude for its &s;ettle|ment to the advantage of the labouring mi|ners, as well as for allowing the adventurers, and others engaged in the trade, a pro&s;pect of a rea&s;onable profit, was &s;uch, that under the continued exertion of his faculties for &s;everal weeks, his &s;trength evidently declined.</P>
<P>The Circular yearly meeting falling this year in Cornwall, had been at our &s;pring quar|terly meeting appointed to be held at Truro, the 7th, 8th, and 9th of the Eighth month, which was &s;everal weeks earlier than it was cu&s;tomary to hold that meeting. This had oc|ca&s;ioned &s;ome demur in the minds of &s;ome friends, who doubted whether tho&s;e of the di&s;tant counties might be &s;o generally at liber|ty to attend it, as if it &s;hould be held in its u&s;ual cour&s;e; and &s;ome friends gave a prefer|ence to another town for the meeting. But my hu&s;band having attentively con&s;idered when and where to fix this important &s;olemnity, un|der a concern that the All-wi&s;e Director would deign to influence the minds of Friends there|in, was &s;teady in his judgment that both the time and place propo&s;ed were right: and the event &s;hewed that he was not mi&s;taken. He with other friends were engaged in preparing accommodation for this meeting, and the town's people were very ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t. A large booth was erected to hold it in, and
<PB N="296" REF="034371_0296_0FFC2F7E94C64C60">
other places were procured, if that &s;hould not be &s;ufficient to contain the people.</P>
<P>I was yet in a feeble &s;tate, and as it appear|ed to me improbable that the meeting would be attended by &s;o many mini&s;ters and friends of religious weight, from the di&s;tant counties con&s;tituting it, and other parts of the nation, as in &s;ome pa&s;t years, my &s;pirit was weighed down under a &s;en&s;e of the great importance of the &s;ervice, and the di&s;proportion of my natu|ral &s;trength to the labour of &s;o large meetings. My faith was indeed ready to fail; but I cried unto the Lord, in the language of Sam&s;on, If the te&s;timony of his Truth might but be exalted through me as an in&s;trument, "let me die," if it be thy will, in this great effort to over|come the Phili&s;tine nature in the people: and this proved to be the la&s;t of tho&s;e general meetings which I attended. In the night be|fore we went to Truro, my dear hu&s;band was &s;o much indi&s;po&s;ed with the giddine&s;s in his head, that he propo&s;ed to me to go to Truro, and leave him to take an emetic, which he hop|ed might ea&s;e his head, and to come to me the next morning. I was reluctant to leave him behind me, and it was well I did not, as the &s;training to vomit would probably have produced in&s;tant death. He grew bettter to|wards mid-day, and accompanied me to Tru|ro, where we met with many of our friends, and he regained his wonted cheerfulne&s;s and activity, and was very &s;erviceable during the cour&s;e of the meetings, in regulating the holding
<PB N="297" REF="034371_0297_0FFC2F7AFA262B60">
of them, &s;ettling the people, and taking &s;hare in the care that nothing might happen among&s;t our young people at the &s;everal inns, which might tend to &s;hade the te&s;timony of that pure Truth, which we met to propagate, from ve|ry di&s;tant parts of the nation. The concour&s;e of people, e&s;pecially of tho&s;e not profe&s;&s;ing with us, was very great, and not a few of them of the higher rank. Many came far to attend the meetings, and behaved with be|coming decency, con&s;i&s;tently with &s;o &s;olemn an occa&s;ion. The booth, though as large as a good voice could well extend over to be di&s;|tinctly heard, would not near contain the peo|ple; &s;o that friends were obliged to hold a meeting in the afternoons of the 7th and 8th in another place.</P>
<P>This con&s;equently tended to divide the mi|ni&s;ters to the &s;everal meetings, and, as I had fore&s;een, much of the &s;ervice of the meetings in the booth devolved upon me; yet not &s;o, but that &s;ome other mini&s;ters had an acceptable &s;hare therein. The te&s;timony of Truth was largely and freely declared, and aro&s;e in its na|tive dignity, and clearne&s;s; &s;o that very many not profe&s;&s;ing with us a&s;&s;ented to the truths preached. The public meetings concluded on the 9th before dinner, under the over&s;hadow|ing wing of Divine love, life, and power. The minds of many friends were comfortably impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of the continued extend|ings of the heavenly Shepherd's care over us as a religious Society; as well as of his conde&s;cen&s;ion
<PB N="298" REF="034371_0298_0FFC2F792E5294E0">
in cau&s;ing his go&s;pel call to go forth among&s;t others, and they turned their faces homeward in the afternoon, in humble thankfulne&s;s.</P>
<P>Here I may ob&s;erve, as it hath occurred to me when attending tho&s;e large general meet|ings, how different in their nature and tenden|cy the&s;e meetings are, to tho&s;e which are ap|pointed by profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tians for amu&s;ement, wherein there is much noi&s;y mirth, and unchri&s;|tian jollity: and if in &s;ome of them, the en|tainments, in one part of the day, have an outward and pompous &s;hew of religion, under the vain and fal&s;e pretence of prai&s;ing God with the voice, accompanied with in&s;truments of mu&s;ick, in the repetition of &s;ome of the mo&s;t &s;ublime and in&s;tructive parts of Scrip|ture; in another part of it, the Chri&s;tian name is &s;hamefully di&s;honoured, by the amu&s;e|ments, which &s;ucceed what they call their &s;a|cred oratorios. I have been &s;hocked in the con&s;ideration, of the expre&s;&s;ions of holy men of God, who penned them as the Holy Spirit dictated them, and &s;ome awful in&s;tructive hi&s;|torical parts of Scripture, becoming pro&s;titu|ted to the purpo&s;e of amu&s;ement; and furni&s;h|ing occa&s;ion for many nominal Chri&s;tians to a&s;|&s;emble, to gratify their inclinations to pride, vanity, and pompous appearances, as well as in &s;ome in&s;tances, the practi&s;ing of gro&s;s wick|edne&s;s: in&s;omuch, that it may be &s;aid with truth, the Lord of Purity abhors their religious mock|ery, and their &s;eemingly &s;olemn meetings are iniquity; and as &s;uch, an abomination in his
<PB N="299" REF="034371_0299_0FFC2F76D5783B28">
holy eyes, who cannot be impo&s;ed upon by &s;pecious pretences, nor bribed by donations given for di&s;tre&s;&s;ed objects, to withhold his righteous judgments; which will a&s;&s;uredly be executed, in their appointed &s;ea&s;on, on
<Q>all the proud, and tho&s;e who work wicked|ne&s;s.</Q>
How different to the&s;e (I &s;ay again and without o&s;tentation), are the meetings, of which in the cour&s;e of the&s;e memoirs I have &s;o frequently given an account! whereto ma|ny friends re&s;ort, from very di&s;tant places and at a very con&s;iderable expen&s;e, with a view to the edifying of others by the pure doctrines which may be freely preached in their publick a&s;&s;emblies, and by a conduct con&s;i&s;tent with Chri&s;tian morality and rectitude; and with de|&s;ires to be edified together in the pre&s;ence of the Lord, in who&s;e pre&s;ence there is life, and at who&s;e right hand there are plea&s;ures, &s;ub|lime, and everla&s;tingly durable. My &s;pirit wor&s;hips in the &s;en&s;e of the foreta&s;te of them, which I have experienced in the pre&s;ent &s;tate; and in the hope, which cheers in the painful &s;ea&s;ons and afflictive occurrences attendant thereon, that finally, the immortal &s;pirit will be &s;olaced in the ine&s;timable, and, by it un|merited, reward which is appointed for the righteous, and is unmixed with &s;orrow.</P>
<P>From this, I hope not ill-timed, digre&s;&s;ion, I return to the 10th of the Eighth month; when &s;everal of the mini&s;ters who had attend|ed the meetings at Truro were at ours at Re|druth: among&s;t whom was my friend Hawk&s;|worth,
<PB N="300" REF="034371_0300_0FFC31AE944FDFF8">
worth, who came with intent to &s;pend &s;ome time with us, in hope that we might be favour|ed together with a little re&s;t both of body and mind, which might tend to the recruiting our &s;trength. But alas! although this important &s;olemnity was &s;o well over, and my dear hu&s;|band's engagements in temporal concerns now &s;at comparatively light, and we were cheered for two days, the third evinced the in&s;tability of all human comforts. On the 11th, our friend, T. Bevington of Worce&s;ter, came to pay us a &s;hort vi&s;it. He expre&s;&s;ed an inclina|tion to have a meeting with the town's peo|ple; and my hu&s;band going, as he was accu&s;|tomed upon &s;uch occa&s;ions, to inform &s;ome of them that a meeting would be held that even|ing, was ob&s;erved to do it with rather more than common &s;olemnity and tenderne&s;s of &s;pi|rit. I hope the meeting was &s;erviceable, and we &s;pent the evening agreeably with our friends.</P>
<P>In the morning of the 12th, T. Bevington left his place pretty early, and my dear hu&s;|band aro&s;e before me in &s;eemingly u&s;ual health, and ate &s;ome breakfa&s;t, but was &s;ud|denly &s;eized with an acute pain in his brea&s;t. He came and found me dre&s;&s;ing, and told me that the pain was extreme, but &s;aid that he conceived it was only on the mu&s;cles, and might be rheumatick, but that he could cover the &s;pot affected with his finger. He cho&s;e to undre&s;s and go into bed, and complained of cold. I &s;ent for an apothecary who appre|hended
<PB N="301" REF="034371_0301_0FFA6CA3E90F6210">
no danger in his ca&s;e, and gave him a &s;mall do&s;e of paregoric elixir, which operated to quiet him and &s;tupify his pain. I left a &s;er|vant with him, and got &s;ome breakfa&s;t, and returning found him rather inclined to &s;leep, &s;o, having &s;ome family concerns to attend to, I left him again. The maid who was left with him &s;aid he complained of a return of his pain and &s;he &s;oon perceived &s;uch an alteration as oc|ca&s;ioned her to ring the bell violently, on which my friend Lydia Hawk&s;worth and I ha&s;|tened to the chamber. She came &s;oon enough to &s;ee him draw his la&s;t breath; but my lame|ne&s;s not permitting me to make &s;o much &s;peed, and the maid preventing me from immediately approaching his bed-&s;ide, I &s;aw only a breath|le&s;s corp&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus ended the valuable life of my dearly beloved William Phillips, in the manner he had repeatedly expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire it might end, that is &s;uddenly; though not altogether unex|pectedly by him&s;elf, as may have been noticed by what I have noted before we &s;et out on our late journey. He intimated to me, that his pro&s;pects in regard to &s;ervice in the pre&s;ent &s;tate were much clo&s;ed; and that in re&s;pect to the future he had no cloud before him; and he would &s;peak of the &s;olemn clo&s;e with that ea&s;e that di&s;covered he expected no &s;ting of con&s;cience in his death: but the rea&s;on he gave for wi&s;hing (in &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the Divine will) that it might be &s;udden, was, that he had felt &s;o little pain in pa&s;&s;ing through time,
<PB N="302" REF="034371_0302_0FFA6CA59E9FAD08">
until he had attained the common age of man, that he doubted whether if tried with it in the awful &s;ea&s;on of death, he &s;hould &s;upport it with that calm, patient dignity, which graces the clo&s;e of a Chri&s;tian life.</P>
<P>By appearances upon his body when it was cold, it was evident that a large blood ve&s;&s;el had broken in his brea&s;t; although not the lea&s;t indication of &s;uch an event appeared by any di&s;charge from the mouth, whil&s;t he was alive. His de&s;ire of attending the meeting at Truro was gratified, which had not been the ca&s;e had it been held in its u&s;ual cour&s;e. Nei|ther is it probable that I could have attended and laboured therein with that &s;trength of mind I was favoured to do, had this important &s;troke been executed before that meeting: for although I was pre&s;erved from &s;inking into a &s;tate of condemnable &s;orrow; the &s;hock at|tending it could not be &s;u&s;tained without my already much enfeebled nature &s;uffering by it. We had lived in the tender endearing connec|tion of marriage &s;omewhat more than thirteen years, after a friend&s;hip of about three-and-twenty. The tie of natural affection betwixt us was &s;trong, ari&s;ing from a &s;imilarity of &s;en|timents, which was &s;trengthened by an infi|nitely higher connection. Indeed he was a man who commanded love, e&s;teem, and re&s;pect, from his numerous relations, friends, and ac|quaintance, in their different ranks and &s;ta|tions. He was exten&s;ively u&s;eful without prid|ing him&s;elf with it, and he commanded the
<PB N="303" REF="034371_0303_0FFC31AD08D16A70">
a&s;&s;ent of the judgment of tho&s;e, among&s;t whom he might be looked upon as a principal, in the tran&s;actions of bu&s;ine&s;s, by &s;ound rea|&s;oning rather than by overbearing. Such was his publick character, drawn, as far as it goes, not beyond the life, though by his af|flicted affectionate widow.</P>
<P>She al&s;o be&s;t knew his private virtues, and engaging manners, exemplified in his family connections, friend&s;hips, and the general tenor of his conduct; and therefore may &s;ay, that he was a kind ma&s;ter, an affectionate father, and a warm and &s;teady friend; always ready to &s;erve his relations, friends, and neighbours, by advice, or as an executor, or referee in di&s;puted ca&s;es. An affectionately tender hu&s;|band&mdash;Ah, me! how &s;hall I delineate this part of his character! Bound to me by the endearing ties of love and friend&s;hip, height|ened by religious &s;ympathy, his re&s;pect as well as affection, was apparent to our friends and acquaintance. His abilities to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in my religious engagements were con&s;picuous; for although he had no &s;hare in the mini&s;terial labour, he was ready to promote it. His na|tural temper, though quick, was &s;oft and complai&s;ant; a man of exact order in his bu&s;i|ne&s;s, and &s;trict oeconomy, even to minute cir|cum&s;tances; yet prudently liberal in his ex|pen&s;es, and charitable to the poor.</P>
<P>In his religious character, he was firmly fix|ed in his principles agreeably to his profe&s;&s;ion, and concerned to act con&s;i&s;tently with them;
<PB N="304" REF="034371_0304_0FFC31A9F0AFF958">
but, clothed with charity towards all men, he rejoiced if a reformation of mind and manners was wrought among&s;t mankind, whoever were the in&s;truments of it. His experience in the &s;pirituality of religion was deeper than even &s;ome of his friends might conceive; as it was &s;ometimes concealed under the veil of cheer|fulne&s;s, which predominated in his con&s;tituti|on; or &s;ecreted, through his aver&s;ion to make any o&s;tentatious &s;hew of it; but when called up to &s;ome &s;ervices in Chri&s;t's church, it was evident that he had been in&s;tructed in his &s;chool. His faith and tru&s;t in the Divine power, wi&s;dom, and providence, were &s;trong; which enabled him to &s;u&s;tain di&s;appointment and worldly lo&s;&s;es with firmne&s;s. In this he was tried in &s;ome in&s;tances, to a degree which would have &s;haken many minds; but he would &s;ay, If a part is gone, I have many mercies left to be thankful for; and he therefore en|deavoured to pre&s;erve his wonted calmne&s;s and cheerfulne&s;s.</P>
<Q><L>And when Death's &s;olemn &s;haft with &s;wiftne&s;s flew,</L>
<L>Prepar'd he &s;tood, and no confu&s;ion knew;</L>
<L>Sudden the &s;troke, but peaceful was his end;</L>
<L>Angels his con&s;orts, and his Lord his friend.</L>
<L>Belov'd and honour'd, &s;ee, his &s;pirit &s;oars</L>
<L>To heavenly man&s;ions, and his God adores.</L></Q>
<P>If any peru&s;e what I have written, who had but partial knowledge of him, they may perhaps conclude me too abundant in encomi|ums upon him. But there are who can &s;ub|&s;cribe to their truth, and who might add their
<PB N="305" REF="034371_0305_0FFC31A7B940EFC8">
te&s;timony to his worth and abilities as a man, and a u&s;eful member of the community at large, as well as an honourable one of the re|ligious &s;ociety of Friends: and if his de&s;cen|dants in the natural line, &s;ucceed him in that of virtue and piety, they will value this at|tempt to delineate his character.</P>
<P>My dear brother was fa&s;t declining in his health. He had lately received an alarm, by a &s;troke of the Pal&s;y, to trim his lamp, unto which I hope he attended. He was now in part recovered, but in the &s;ucceeding &s;pring was revi&s;ited by that di&s;tre&s;&s;ing di&s;order, which quickly terminated his life; in the clo&s;e where|of he was favoured with the cheering pro&s;pect of his immortal &s;pirit's centering in everla&s;ting ble&s;&s;edne&s;s. He was endowed with a very good natural under&s;tanding, which in the lat|ter part of his life was &s;o much employed for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his friends and neighbours, both of the town and country wherein he re|&s;ided, that he had as much bu&s;ine&s;s in accom|modating di&s;putes about property, and other acts of kind aid as his &s;trength would well bear. He died beloved, and his lo&s;s was re|gretted by both the rich and poor.</P>

<HEAD>A TESTIMONY from the monthly meeting of Friends for the We&s;tern divi&s;ion of Cornwall, held at Falmouth the <HI>6</HI>th of the Fourth Month, <HI>1795,</HI> concerning our late valued friend, CA|THERINE PHILLIPS, formerly PAYTON.</HEAD>
<P>IT appears, from accounts received, that &s;he was born at Dudley in Worce&s;ter&s;hire, the 16th of the Fir&s;t month, 1726-7, Old Stile. Her parents, Henry and Ann Payton were honourable friends; and he an approved mini|&s;ter, who, when in health, was much from home in the di&s;charge of his religious duties; but for many of the latter years of his life was confined to his chamber by a paralytic di&s;|order: &s;o that the care of a large young fa|mily devolved mo&s;tly upon his wife, a woman of eminent piety and prudence, who&s;e anxious &s;olicitude for, and watchful attention to, her children, they have often commemorated with filial tenderne&s;s. Thus in&s;tructed by exam|ple and precept, our beloved friend was early engaged
<Q>to &s;eek the Lord for her portion, and to know the God of her fathers to be the lot of her inheritance.</Q>
And being much the companion of her afflicted father,
<PB N="307" REF="034371_0307_0FFC31A3E3CF9E28">
&s;he was probably thereby pre&s;erved from many levities incident to youth, as well as edified by his innocent conver&s;ation and virtues. In this allotment &s;he had al&s;o opportunity to cultivate a di&s;po&s;ition for retirement, &s;o favourable to the growth of that good &s;eed which the hea|venly hu&s;bandman had &s;own in her heart. Neverthele&s;s, as &s;he advanced in years, &s;he found the propen&s;ities of natural inclination and wi&s;dom &s;trongly oppo&s;ed to the manife&s;ta|tion of Divine grace; and through the con|ver&s;ation of &s;ome who&s;e minds were not &s;uffi|ciently guarded by that fear
<Q>which pre&s;erv|eth from the &s;nares of death;</Q>
together with the introduction of books incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;implicity of Truth, her be&s;t intere&s;t was greatly endangered. But it plea&s;ed Him who&s;e gracious purpo&s;e it was to &s;eparate her to his &s;ervice, about the &s;eventeenth year of her age, to renew the powerful vi&s;itation of his love; and, being favoured to &s;ee the &s;tation de&s;igned for her in the church militant, &s;he was made willing to endure the bapti&s;ms nece&s;&s;ary to that end. Under this trying di&s;pen&s;ation &s;he ex|perienced the enemy of her &s;oul to be a &s;ubtil as well as an open enemy; and earne&s;t were her petitions, that &s;he might be enabled to centre &s;o deep in the re&s;ignation of her own will, as clearly to di&s;tingui&s;h his deceptive voice from that of the true Shepherd; and thus be pre&s;erved from &s;tepping forth in her &s;ervice, before the appointed time. And this petition was no doubt granted by Him who
<PB N="308" REF="034371_0308_0FFC31A195072DC0">
&s;aw the integrity and dedication of her mind: for having, as we believe, pa&s;&s;ed through this work of preparation, the fruit produced was corre&s;pondently mature; and her progre&s;s in religious experience and u&s;efulne&s;s di&s;tingui&s;ha|bly eminent. Her fir&s;t publick appearance was in &s;upplication at Dudley meeting, on the 10th of the Second month, 1748, being then in the twenty-&s;econd year of her age; and in the following year &s;he entered upon her travels in the mini&s;try, which continued with little in|termi&s;&s;ion until within about nine years of her decea&s;e; during which latter &s;pace &s;he was mo&s;tly confined at home by indi&s;po&s;ition of body. Be&s;ides repeatedly vi&s;iting mo&s;t of the counties in England and Wales, her travels extended to Ireland, Scotland, Holland, and the continent of America: in the cour&s;e of which, according to accounts received, her labours among&s;t friends and others were ble&s;|&s;ed, to the convincement, edification, and comfort of many. In the year 1772, &s;he en|tered upon the marriage &s;tate with our late valued friend William Phillips, and removed into Cornwall; where &s;he was much engaged in religious labour, as well for the &s;preading of the te&s;timonies of Truth among &s;trangers, as in repairing the wa&s;te places in the Society: being often zealou&s;ly concerned for the &s;upport of our Chri&s;tian di&s;cipline, that irremediable ca&s;es which have been too much neglected, and were as &s;tumbling-blocks, might be re|moved out of the way of &s;ober inquirers; and
<PB N="309" REF="034371_0309_0FFC319F638E8DE8">
particularly for the right e&s;tabli&s;hment of wo|men's meetings, in which her &s;ervice was con|&s;iderable.</P>
<P>During her long confinement and illne&s;s, a little before which time her tenderly affection|ate hu&s;band was &s;uddenly removed from her by death, &s;he was often deeply tried; yet had to te&s;tify that the Lord's hand was &s;till at times revealed for her &s;upport and pre&s;ervation, and that his
<Q>wi&s;dom is &s;tamped on every di&s;pen|&s;ation of his Providence.</Q>
And although it was not permitted her to behold much fruits of her many arduous labours and &s;ecret bap|ti&s;ms among&s;t us, we believe they have been ble&s;&s;ed to &s;ome of us; and with regard to others, we have a hope, as the Lord often &s;ees meet for wi&s;e ends, to veil from the view of his faithful labourers the extent of their u&s;efulne&s;s, that the good &s;eed &s;own through the in&s;trumentality of this highly favoured &s;er|vant will not be lo&s;t; but in due &s;ea&s;on pro|duce the de&s;ired increa&s;e to the prai&s;e of his own ever worthy Name.</P>
<P>Some time before her decea&s;e, &s;he thus ex|pre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf;
<Q>I am going where the wick|ed cea&s;e from troubling, and the weary are at re&s;t. Oh, the&s;e &s;ouls of ours! that we &s;hould be willing to run the ri&s;k of lo&s;ing them for any of the enjoyments of this life. I may &s;ay to you, Follow me as I have fol|lowed Chri&s;t. Beware of pride, and of the very ground of pride.</Q>
When under pre&s;|&s;ure of great bodily &s;uffering, &s;he &s;aid,
<Q>This
<PB N="310" REF="034371_0310_0FFC319D36503490">
is a trial; Lord God Almighty &s;anctify it to my &s;oul.</Q>
To one pre&s;ent &s;he &s;aid,
<Q>My dear child, the Lord God Almighty ble&s;s thee in every re&s;pect; all things may be done, and all things may be borne, through faith and faithfulne&s;s to the Author of all good.</Q>
A few days before her removal, being at dinner, one remarked how little &s;he ate. She replied,
<Q>it will do its office as long as nece&s;&s;ary; and I am thankful that I feel no cloud;</Q>
and, making a &s;hort pau&s;e, add|ed,
<Q>I have received a recompence at the Lord's hand for &s;in:</Q>
&s;oon after which, the fits which attended her in this illne&s;s returned, and continued till about half an hour before &s;he expired, during which &s;pace &s;he lay very quiet, and drew her breath &s;horter and &s;horter to the la&s;t. She died the 16th of the Eighth month, 1794, in the &s;ixty-eighth year of her age, and forty-&s;ixth of her mini&s;try; and, af|ter a meeting of friends and others of the neighbourhood held on the occa&s;ion, was de|cently interred at Kea.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Dudley,
<DATE>18th of Eleventh Month, 1751.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>My Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT was not becau&s;e I had not a due e&s;teem for thy letter, that I did not an&s;wer it from Dublin; for indeed I read it with plea|&s;ure, and am thankful thou counte&s;t me in any degree worthy of thy friend&s;hip; but being pretty much hurried, could hardly get a quiet hour to write. I now make u&s;e of the fir&s;t convenient opportunity to inform thee, that, through Divine favour, I have &s;afely reached my outward habitation, and was gladly re|ceived by my dear mother, &amp;c. whom I found in as good a &s;tate of health as I expected. My
<PB N="314" REF="034371_0313_0FFC3197518B5158">
mind, for the mo&s;t part &s;ince I came home, has been quiet and ea&s;y, re&s;ting under the enjoy|ment of peace in di&s;charging my duty to your nation; which &s;ervice, as thou hinte&s;t, was not undertaken in my own will, nor perform|ed in my own &s;trength; but He who &s;ent me forth, vouch&s;afed to accompany me: and though he many times &s;aw meet that I &s;hould be deeply tried, he was with me in the deeps, as well as in the heights, pre&s;erving in danger and di&s;tre&s;s. Un&s;een he helped me, becau&s;e he knew my &s;oul looked to him for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, de&s;iring to be guided by his unerring coun&s;el. I write not this boa&s;tingly, for my &s;pirit is humbled, under a &s;en&s;e of his goodne&s;s and unmerited love. What am I, that the Maje&s;|ty of heaven &s;hould thus conde&s;cend to vi&s;it me? A poor, weak, unprofitable &s;ervant, un|to whom belongs fear and confu&s;ion of face. Ah! my dear friend, what are the be&s;t of us all, without the Divine pre&s;ence or a&s;&s;i&s;tance? It is that is our &s;trength, our crown, and re|joicing; by that are we made beautiful; and, dive&s;ted of that, become as nothing: O! may I ever live in a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;eeking after it. O! my God, &s;ooner cut the thread of my life, than &s;uffer me to fall from ta&s;ting thy goodne&s;s: let me not bring di&s;honour on thy great Name, which I now reverence and adore.

<HEAD>EPISTLE II. To the few who have been convinced of the rec|titude of waiting upon the Lord in Silence, and accustomed to meet for that good end, in Cardiff.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN the love of my heavenly Father, joined with a &s;en&s;e of duty, am I engaged thus to &s;alute you; de&s;iring your &s;tedfa&s;tne&s;s in the unchangeable Truth: that being grounded in right faith, you may not be carried away with every wind of doctrine, but in &s;tability of mind, may be able to di&s;tingui&s;h betwixt what proceeds pure from the Fountain of wi&s;dom, and what is mixed with human policy, and the traditions of men; which tend to alienate the mind from the &s;implicity of go&s;pel wor&s;hip, and fix it in outward performances, amu&s;ing it with bodily exerci&s;es which profit but little. By this means, many times, that tender &s;piritual &s;en&s;ation, with which the &s;oul in the infancy of religion is ble&s;&s;ed, in mea&s;ure is lo&s;t, and the under&s;tanding clouded; the mind being either plunged in a labyrinth of thought, or exalted above that diffident childlike &s;tate, in which the humble followers of the Lamb de|light to abide: becau&s;e therein they are capa|ble
<PB N="317" REF="034371_0316_0FFC31902B282C08">
of knowing his voice from that of a &s;tran|ger; and receive &s;trength to follow him through the &s;everal di&s;pen&s;ations of probation he is plea&s;ed to allot them.</P>
<P>Many times &s;ince I &s;aw your faces have I looked towards you, and I wi&s;h I could &s;ay I have beheld all keeping their habitations in the Lord. But, alas! in&s;tead of that, has there not been a &s;werving a&s;ide, and building again that which you had taken &s;ome good &s;teps to|wards aboli&s;hing; which, who&s;oever does, makes him&s;elf a tran&s;gre&s;&s;or? May I not que|ry, Why halt ye between two opinions? I be|lieve this to be one cau&s;e of your weakne&s;s, and, I fear, if per&s;i&s;ted in, will prove your de&s;truction. I believe it was the merciful de|&s;ign of the Almighty to redeem you from a dependency on mortals, and to bring you to wait for the immediate teachings of his Spirit, and to confide in his power, from a lively &s;en&s;e of its &s;ufficiency: and had you &s;imply followed him, his Almighty arm had been exalted to the bringing down of your enemies, and the enlarging of your under&s;tandings; &s;o that you would not only have &s;een that there was light, but the miraculous cure of blindne&s;s had been perfected, and in the light you would have di&s;cerned objects clearly. Here you would have grown in Chri&s;tian experience, and having received the holy unction, you would have found as you abode under it, that you needed not that any man &s;hould teach you, for that this anointing was &s;ufficient to in|&s;truct
<PB N="318" REF="034371_0317_0FFC318E02F66C40">
in all things. And here you would have been able to di&s;tingui&s;h betwixt words accom|panied with, and tho&s;e without, the power of God, by the different effects each had in the &s;oul: the one tending to quicken unto God, and the other to bring death over the &s;piritual life. According to the nature of things, a mini&s;try out of the life of the go&s;pel can only beget its likene&s;s: it may fill the head with notions, but can never repleni&s;h the &s;oul with grace. But, as it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of the enemy to de|lude the judgment with fal&s;e appearances, he will endeavour, by puffing up the mind with vain conceits, to make a likene&s;s of the effects of the Truth.</P>
<P>The head being &s;tored with knowledge, and Chri&s;tianity in part under&s;tood in theory, by working upon the imagination, the poor deluded creature may boa&s;t of vi&s;ions and en|joyments, and, &s;oaring on the wings of decep|tion, may abound in rapturous expre&s;&s;ions; but though he may talk of God and Chri&s;t from morning till evening, it is but warming him&s;elf at a fire of his own kindling, being de&s;titute of the efficacy of grace.</P>
<P>Truth has a natural tendency to humble all the faculties of the &s;oul, to make it
<Q>rejoice with trembling,</Q>
and to clothe it with meek|ne&s;s, re&s;ignation, and contrition; in which &s;tate it &s;eeks to repo&s;e it&s;elf in the brea&s;t of the Beloved; or in &s;ilent adoration to bond before his throne, and in tenderne&s;s pour forth it&s;elf in mental prayer, or prai&s;es; but to ad|dre&s;s

him verbally with awful reverence and &s;elf-diffidence, knowing it is pre&s;umption &s;o to do but from the movings of his &s;pirit. If it be long deprived of his pre&s;ence, it &s;eeks him &s;orrowing; but as it advances in experience, is cautious of di&s;clo&s;ing its condition (as in the night) to the various reputed watchmen; le&s;t they, either through uncharitablene&s;s or un|&s;kilfulne&s;s, wound in&s;tead of heal; by unveiling to the unregenerated the &s;ecret conflicts it en|dures; or direct it to other objects, in&s;tead of informing it where to find him whom it &s;eeks.</P>
<P>The&s;e ob&s;ervations occurring to my mind, I hope you will receive them in go&s;pel love, in which I think they are communicated. I now conclude, with de&s;iring that if any in&s;tability has appeared in your conduct, you may for the future keep more clo&s;e to the Divine Guide; that you may be clothed with wi&s;dom and &s;trength, and witne&s;s &s;alvation and peace to attend you.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Brother,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HERETOFORE when ab&s;ent, I have been ea&s;y in remembering thee with &s;incere de|&s;ires for thy welfare; but now a de&s;ire of writ|ing thee taking place, I am unwilling to &s;tifle it, were it only for this rea&s;on, that I would do all that is ju&s;tly in my power, to &s;trengthen that affection which ought to &s;ub&s;i&s;t betwixt per&s;ons &s;o nearly allied in nature. But alas! when I con&s;ider the difference of our affec|tions, pur&s;uits, and &s;entiments, in right and wrong, I am fearful to &s;et pen to paper, le&s;t I &s;hould not be read with candour and under|&s;tanding; yet am again encouraged to this conclu&s;ion, that thou wilt at lea&s;t receive it as the effect of my regard for thee. Regard, did I &s;ay? I will alter the term to affection;
<PB N="321" REF="034371_0320_0FFC3186C1D5D940">
which I have felt gently to &s;pring in my &s;oul towards thee; not only as to a creature form|ed by the &s;ame Almighty hand as my&s;elf, and for the &s;ame noble end, viz. to glorify him who gave us being, and who has loaded us with a multitude of his favours (which loud|ly call for a grateful return); but, as to a brother who has &s;trayed from the path of peace and &s;afety, and is &s;eeking &s;atisfaction in the gra&s;p of empty bubbles; which have a&s;|&s;umed the form, in his &s;ight, of &s;omething &s;ub&s;tantial. But thy own experience, if im|partially traced, will tell thee, they have bro|ken when touched and di&s;per&s;ed in air; leav|ing nothing real behind them, but keen re|mor&s;e, and the painful remembrance that they are lo&s;t, with all the time, pains and anxiety, be&s;towed in the pur&s;uit of them. Yet in this idle &s;olicitude, (O! affecting but too ju&s;t charge!) has a great part of thy life been &s;pent; ardently traver&s;ing the de&s;tructive ma|zes of delu&s;ive plea&s;ure, and indu&s;triou&s;ly a|voiding the One only Good, in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of which thy &s;oul might have found &s;ub&s;tan|tial happine&s;s: a happine&s;s which would have afforded true contentment, in which is convey|ed that fulne&s;s of joy, which only can &s;atisfy the immortal part, being it&s;elf immortal in its nature.</P>
<P>Thou wilt perhaps &s;ay that the&s;e are my &s;en|timents. But &s;uffer me to a&s;k thee, why they are not thine? Why do we differ in opinion and practice, but becau&s;e the de&s;ire and pur&s;uit
<PB N="322" REF="034371_0321_0FFC31848BE4A998">
of &s;en&s;ual gratifications have blinded thy judg|ment, and bia&s;&s;ed thy actions? I will venture to a&s;&s;ert that it was the kingdom or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of this world, its friend&s;hips, vanities, and &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ures, &s;pread in the view of thy mind, that drew it from its early love and al|legiance to Him who is truly worthy of love and obedience. Nature joined with the well adapted temptation (being fond of pre&s;ent en|joyment, though it be forbidden fruit), and renounced &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the pure law of grace written in the heart; which, had it been ob|&s;erved, would have rectified her impure and irregular appetites, and have placed thee in the true &s;tate of manhood; as lord of, not &s;lave to, the creation; and governor of thy|&s;elf, in happy &s;ubjection to the Divine will: a will which invariably points out the everla&s;t|ing felicity of mankind. But, rebel to her own intere&s;t, nature, blinded by fal&s;e affec|tion, and fraught with pride, like our fir&s;t parents, does not like a &s;uperior that &s;hall con|troul her perver&s;ene&s;s, and pre&s;cribe laws for her direction; but rather chu&s;es to take the reins of government into her own hand, and plan out a way for her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Here rea&s;on, blind fallen rea&s;on, enthron|ed by the power of Satan, u&s;urps the &s;overeign &s;eat, as &s;itting in the temple of God, being honoured as God; power, wi&s;dom, and di&s;|cretion to direct, being a&s;cribed unto it. This fal&s;e king (who, had he occupied his proper place, had made a good &s;ubject), joins in &s;trict
<PB N="323" REF="034371_0322_0FFC3182FA5A4738">
league with the pa&s;&s;ions, and pre&s;cribes rules directed by the&s;e his allies.
<Q>Shall man (&s;ays he) be confined within the narrow rules of virtue and religion? No, I proclaim him li|berty. Let him indulge him&s;elf in what is de&s;irable to him; let him gratify the &s;ight of his eye, and the pride of his heart, in en|deavouring to make him&s;elf agreeable to and admired by mankind; with whom let him join in full &s;ociety, and free communion, en|tertaining and being entertained. Why may he not partake of the plea&s;ures of &s;en&s;e, &s;ee|ing he has appetites for them; and &s;atisfy his curio&s;ity in knowing evil as well as good?</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e are the genuine &s;ugge&s;tions of the rea&s;oning faculty guided by the pa&s;&s;ions (though I confe&s;s that I believe the &s;ubtle deceiver of mankind, &s;ometimes teaches this rea&s;on to &s;peak in a language more concealed than I have here &s;et down); but I think it will be no hard mat|ter to prove, that this boa&s;ted liberty is real bondage, and that this acqui&s;ition of know|ledge is no more than a &s;en&s;e of guilt, re&s;ult|ing from the lo&s;s of that innocence which gave man boldne&s;s to appear before the face of Al|mighty ju&s;tice and purity, void of di&s;tracting fear.</P>
<P>Let us examine the extent of virtue and re|ligion, and mark every pa&s;&s;ion implanted by Providence in the nature of man; and we &s;hall find that in them alone it is po&s;&s;ible the&s;e &s;hould be rightly gratified, and that whenever
<PB N="324" REF="034371_0323_0FFC3180C750C998">
man breaks from their bounds, he flies from the mark of his happine&s;s.</P>
<P>I have looked upon love to be the govern|ing pa&s;&s;ion in the &s;oul, which, as it moves, draws the re&s;t in its train, and, being &s;trongly fixed on a worthy or unworthy object, is the cau&s;e of our joy or mi&s;ery. This being grant|ed, it is next to be con&s;idered what object is worthy of our entire affection: in which &s;earch let it be remembered, that this principle of love, or de&s;ire of enjoyment, is &s;o &s;eated in the &s;oul, as never to be &s;truck from it; and it will pre&s;ently be allowed, that the object that is worthy of its &s;pending its force upon, or be|ing united to without limitation, mu&s;t not be dependent on time, for that death deprives it of; but durable as its own exi&s;tence, and &s;o perfect as fully to &s;atisfy an everla&s;ting de&s;ire of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. This can be nothing el&s;e but the Eternal Excellency, from whom this &s;park of affection was &s;truck; and if Divine order were not inverted, it would as naturally bend towards it original as a &s;tone to the centre, where only it can find a happy &s;ettlement. In this love of God, &s;tands virtue; it is this in|&s;pires it. If we truly love God, who is infi|nite in purity and wi&s;dom, we &s;hall naturally hate their contraries, impurity, and folly; and &s;hall hate our&s;elves becau&s;e of them: becau&s;e whatever defiles the &s;oul, de&s;troys its likene&s;s to the Divine Being, and renders it unaccept|able in his &s;ight. Hence, as it is the nature of a true affection to endeavour after the love of
<PB N="325" REF="034371_0324_0FFC317DEE6B3590">
the beloved object, proceeds an ardent de&s;ire of purification, and a filial fear of offending God; a fear the mo&s;t rationally founded, viz. in a deep &s;en&s;e of gratitude, con&s;idering him as the Author of all the good we po&s;&s;e&s;s, or can rightly hope for, i. e. everla&s;ting felicity; joined to the knowledge of his power and ju&s;|tice, in puni&s;hing tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, which &s;elf-pre&s;ervation would teach us to &s;hun: there|fore, whatever would amu&s;e the &s;en&s;es, &s;o as to draw the affection from this Fountain of goodne&s;s, is dreaded and renounced as forbid|den fruit.</P>
<P>In religion, the &s;oul is enlarged, and &s;et at li|berty to exerci&s;e its mo&s;t noble faculty, in ac|tions, or on an object, worthy the dignity of its nature; when on the contrary, without it, it is in bondage, and deba&s;ed in the pur&s;uit of what &s;carcely de&s;erves the name of plea&s;ure, being of no real worth or la&s;ting duration. Religion teaches us that we do not live for our&s;elves only; but that in order to obtain the great end of our being, we mu&s;t &s;eek the good of mankind and endeavour to be &s;ervice|able in &s;ociety; yet mix in familiar conver&s;e with caution, le&s;t in&s;tead of rectifying the er|rors of others, we tran&s;plant them into our own conduct. It in&s;tructs us to beware of vain glory, or of &s;eeking the applau&s;e of men; clothing the mind with humility, under a &s;en&s;e that we have no good thing but what we have received from the bounteous hand of our Cre|ator; and rai&s;ing a de&s;ire that all his gifts may
<PB N="326" REF="034371_0325_0FFC317BA9366E28">
be devoted to his &s;ervice. In &s;hort, religion places man in the &s;phere the wi&s;e Author of nature de&s;igned him; directing his affections to a&s;cend towards the Creator, and to de|&s;cend towards the creation. If the a&s;cent be but &s;ufficient, the de&s;cent will be ju&s;t. The creatures will be loved as the work and gifts of the Creator; yet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with due caution from this con&s;ideration, that they are allotted us but for an uncertain &s;ea&s;on; and that it is therefore our intere&s;t to be able to &s;urrender them when called for, with as little pain or anxiety as is con&s;i&s;tent with our &s;tate. On the rever&s;e, the immoderate de&s;cent of the affec|tions ties us down to the earth and earthly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, &s;hackles us in &s;en&s;ual gratifications, effectually prevents the &s;oul's a&s;cending to|wards God, and de&s;troys its deputed &s;ove|reignty over the creation, to which it is in bondage: &s;o true is that a&s;&s;ertion of the apo&s;|tle, that while &s;ome boa&s;ted of their liberty, or promi&s;ed it to others, them&s;elves were the &s;ervants of corruption. I have &s;ometimes con|&s;idered how the excu&s;e of the&s;e boa&s;ted liber|tines be&s;peaks their &s;lavery. We cannot help &s;uch and &s;uch conduct, &s;ay they, or had not power to re&s;i&s;t &s;uch temptations. If this were true, it were acknowledging that they had lo&s;t that valuable ble&s;&s;ing, the free|dom of the will; and are utterly de&s;titute of power to with&s;tand evil; and of con&s;equence are the devil's captives. Such indeed they are, though not nece&s;&s;arily, but voluntarily:
<PB N="327" REF="034371_0326_0FFC317A1E9EB308">
for wi&s;dom and power, through the grace of God, is given unto man, to di&s;cover and re&s;i&s;t the temptations of his enemy; and if he will renounce both, his blindne&s;s and &s;ubjection to the power of delu&s;ion is procured by him&s;elf, as is its mi&s;erable con&s;equence, viz. an ever|la&s;ting &s;eparation from the Fountain of all good.</P>
<P>Thou wilt ea&s;ily perceive, that the intent of the foregoing hints is to influence thy mind in favour of a more &s;trict cour&s;e of virtue than thou ha&s;t formerly pur&s;ued. I will add my earne&s;t wi&s;h that it may be an&s;wered. What &s;hall I &s;ay to per&s;uade thee to turn, and cool|ly and impartially look into thy&s;elf? Shall I plead thy advance in years? Thou art now I conclude rather in the decline of life, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An allu&s;ion to a dream which the party had, where|in (among&s;t other remarkable circum&s;tances) he was met in a beautiful garden by two women, repre&s;ent|ing (according to the interpretation which opened in his mind when he awoke) Virtue and Vanity, who each &s;olicited his company for a walk: and though he &s;trongly inclined to the latter, the former in&s;i&s;ted on his accompanying her, not only for a walk but for life; which rather than comply with, he endea|voured to e&s;cape out of the garden (which he call|ed the world); but coming to the gate, found it locked, and the key in her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. So being forced to a compliance, he accompanied her, and became gradu|ally charmed with her conver&s;ation, by which, he was won to a love of religion, and in the end much delighted with the pro&s;pect of &s;uch a companion for life.</NOTE> ha&s;t|ening towards the gate of the garden.

li&s;ten to the dictates of virtue, ere &s;he with|draw her kind invitations and profitable in&s;truc|tions. Shall I be&s;eech thee by the mercies of God (a prevailing argument with a truly ge|nerous and grateful mind, and which may with great ju&s;tice be particularly advanced to thy|&s;elf), to return unto Him from whom thou ha&s;t deeply revolted, and &s;eek reconciliation by un|feigned repentance, if thou can find room &s;o to do; which I have a lively hope thou may|e&s;t, though thou ha&s;t &s;o long, and di&s;tantly, &s;trayed from the fold of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>I &s;hall plead no excu&s;e for the freedom with which I have here treated thee, further than to &s;ay, that I think a true freedom in commu|nicating our &s;entiments, with a de&s;ign for each other's eternal well-being, is a part of that charity which &s;hould clothe the &s;pirits of the followers of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>The copiou&s;ne&s;s of my &s;ubject may apolo|gize for my prolixity. Upon a review of what I have written it will readily be ob&s;erv|ed, that the hints given are but like heads of chapters, which, if fully expatiated upon, might fill a volume in&s;tead of a letter: and, that the everla&s;ting mini&s;ter of the &s;anctuary may enlarge them in the view of thy under|&s;tanding, to la&s;ting benefit, is the &s;incere and ardent de&s;ire of thy affectionate &s;i&s;ter,</P>

<P>THINE of the 5th ult. I received ye&s;ter|day, and with a degree of &s;atisfaction have ob&s;erved its contents; although it &s;eems to breathe the language of complaint, or at lea&s;t fear of falling &s;hort of the mark thou ha&s;t had in view, and I hope art pre&s;&s;ing after. Al|though this is a &s;tate painful to nature, it is &s;ometimes a &s;tate of greater &s;afety, and more directly pointing to perfection, than is that of ea&s;e, or even of the aboundings of &s;en&s;ible con&s;olations: whereby &s;ome have been induced to conclude them&s;elves in a better and &s;afer &s;tate than they really were, and &s;o have grown le&s;s watchful and diffident of their own judg|ment; and &s;piritual pride and vain-glory have entered, wherein they have boa&s;ted above their mea&s;ure of experience; and at la&s;t "turned the grace of God into wantonne&s;s," and their latter end has been far wor&s;e than their beginning.

that is earne&s;tly bent to obtain the kingdom of God, which &s;tands "in righteou&s;ne&s;s" as well as "in peace and joy in the Holy Gho&s;t," is &s;et upon &s;earching what is the cau&s;e of its being thus de&s;erted; and &s;o "digs deep" through the corruption of fallen nature, and

and that thou and I may be of this happy number, is the travail of my &s;pirit.</P>
<P>It is mo&s;t certain that our journey through life is as through a vale of tears, wherein va|rious will be our conflicts, and numerous our trials, both inwardly and outwardly; but we have this encouraging promi&s;e left us, that
<Q>All &s;hall work together for the good of &s;uch as truly love and fear God.</Q>
And as our hopes and de&s;ires are fixed on an infinitely better country, the joys whereof are pure and eternally permanent, let us not repine at the means u&s;ed to &s;ecure them to us; but with all po&s;&s;ible cheerfulne&s;s take the cup which Divine Providence hands forth to us, as

I have looked up|on it as an infinite mercy to be led deep enough in humiliation, to be &s;tripped of all that has any appearance of what is good and excellent, and to have this the &s;ecret language of the &s;oul to him who &s;ees in &s;ecret,
<Q>I am a worm, and no man:</Q>
and although the con&s;olatory portion of &s;uch as the&s;e may be &s;ometimes hid, or withheld for a &s;ea&s;on; yet they are &s;ure, being in the hands of infinite Wi&s;dom, Truth, and Mercy; who, in the wi&s;e appointment of his providence, will give to his own what they &s;tand in need of; and when the days of fa&s;t|ing and humiliation are accompli&s;hed, will a&s;|&s;uredly

<P>Through mercy I am favoured with a good degree of health and peace in my going for|ward, although the pre&s;ent concern wherein I am engaged is attended with &s;ome di&s;courag|ing circum&s;tances, yet I have faith that I am here in the appointment of heaven.</P>

<P>To be &s;ure it is a nece&s;&s;ary duty to &s;earch our hearts, and not in &s;o doing to evade the judgment of Truth; but it is al&s;o well to guard

again&s;t too ha&s;ty conclu&s;ions of the cau&s;es and ends of exerci&s;es; e&s;pecially in an hour of weak|ne&s;s, wherein the old accu&s;er is not wanting on his part, to &s;ugge&s;t the mo&s;t painful apprehen|&s;ions, thereby to di&s;pirit the mind that &s;eeks to be freed from his in&s;upportable yoke.</P>
<P>The new di&s;covery thou make&s;t of the delu|&s;ivene&s;s of thy thoughts, affords me much &s;atis|faction, as it gives good ground to hope, that the Lord de&s;igns to lead thee to a &s;tate of per|fection, which few, very few, have &s;een into; viz. an entire abdication of &s;elf, even in its mo&s;t plea&s;ing and &s;eeming lawful appearances. That of an ideal &s;atisfaction in &s;omething &s;eem|ingly good, yet &s;hort of the Divine perfection, is an exerci&s;e which attends many, and has pre|vailed again&s;t &s;ome, at lea&s;t to the diminution of that lu&s;tre which would have &s;hone around them. It is a favour &s;o quickly to &s;ee into it, and, having &s;een, I hope thou wilt endeavour to avoid it, and the Lord will help thee.</P>
<P>There is no happine&s;s here equal to perfect redemption from the world, its &s;pirit, and our|&s;elves. To have no hopes, no de&s;ires, but in the will of God, is fully giving our&s;elves into his holy hand, and to be &s;wallowed up of him (though of this, for want of Divine &s;en&s;ation, we may &s;ometimes be ignorant). Here me|thinks I almo&s;t hear thee &s;ay,
<Q>This is the &s;tate I long for, but it is di&s;tant, very di&s;|tant, from me.</Q>
But is it not as of ye&s;ter|day thou &s;awe&s;t into it, and would&s;t thou be perfect at once, and enjoy a victory without a

<HEAD>EPISTLE VI. To Friends in Ireland.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS I am prevented by contrary winds from paying a vi&s;it this fall, to &s;ome of your Pro|vince meetings; &amp;c. (for which end I proceed|ed as far as Liverpool) in the &s;trength of that un|feigned love of the brethren which drew me from my home, am I endeavouring to &s;alute you by a few lines: in hope the Divine wi&s;dom and mercy may direct my pen, to the pre&s;ent relief of my own &s;pirit, and your help.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t, dear friends, permit me to inform you, that the lamentable &s;tate of our church, is almo&s;t continually before me. This in your's as well as other countries, has &s;uffered greatly by the baneful prevalence of the &s;pirit of this world; in&s;omuch, that too few have their hands clean and &s;trong for the Lord's &s;ervice; or can &s;ee to extract the motes from the eyes of their brethren, becau&s;e of the beams which are in their own. May not &s;ome of the in|&s;tructors, and &s;eemingly zealous in our Society, be ju&s;tly taxed with hypocri&s;y; &s;eeing while they cry again&s;t the reigning &s;ins of others, they are inattentive to their own? unto whom
<PB N="337" REF="034371_0336_0FFC3163C24CC690">
I would direct the advice of Chri&s;t, viz. Pluck fir&s;t the beams out of your own eyes, and then &s;hall ye &s;ee clearly to take the motes out of tho&s;e of your brethren.</P>
<P>It is a &s;orrowful truth, that even the gar|ments of &s;ome of the prie&s;thood are &s;potted with the world and the fle&s;h; and they are there|fore rendered unfit to mini&s;ter before the Lord in that &s;acred office. For whatever may have been their former experience of the &s;anctifying operation of his &s;pirit; or however clear may have been their call into his &s;ervice; yet if, like Judas, they have betrayed their Ma&s;ter for the pieces of &s;ilver, or, like Demas, may in &s;pirit have for&s;aken his family for the love of the world in &s;ome of its alluring &s;hapes, theirs ju&s;tly is the judgment pa&s;&s;ed upon Ju|das; who being fallen from his &s;tation in the holy body of Chri&s;t, was to lo&s;e his bi&s;hoprick or part in the apo&s;tle&s;hip: &s;uch being render|ed unfit to give te&s;timony to the life, &s;ufferings, death and re&s;urrection of the holy Je&s;us, who do not retain it in their own experience.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve, brethren, the word <HI>retain.</HI> It is not enough that we have once known the Lord, but we mu&s;t retain him in our knowledge, by the renewed bapti&s;ms of his holy Spirit: and of &s;ome who did not choo&s;e to do &s;o, it is re|corded that
<Q>God gave them up to a reprobate mind, to work tho&s;e things which are not con|venient.</Q>
And I believe there are in our day, who, having deviated from the &s;implicity of Truth for &s;ini&s;ter ends, have have gone wider
<PB N="338" REF="034371_0337_0FFC3160C3804938">
and wider therefrom; until their hearts are be|come &s;o darkened that they call evil good, and good evil; put darkne&s;s for light, and light for darkne&s;s; and, in their pur&s;uits after worldly intere&s;ts, are obviou&s;ly wor&s;hipping and &s;erving the creature more than the Crea|tor: and yet the&s;e very per&s;ons would keep tho&s;e &s;eats, and di&s;charge tho&s;e offices in the church, which were a&s;&s;igned them, when in the days of childhood they were willing to fol|low the Lamb whither&s;oever he led them.</P>
<P>O! for the&s;e blind guides, is my &s;oul pain|ed; and that not only on their own accounts but that of others, who, apprehending the law to proceed from their mouths (though they have in reality no right to take the word of the Lord thereinto) and ob&s;erving their conduct, may be influenced by their example, and fol|low them as they follow the world. Is it need|ful, my beloved, to warn you, as our Lord did the people re&s;pecting the Scribes and Pha|ri&s;ees, who, notwith&s;tanding they &s;at in Mo&s;es' &s;eat, and admini&s;tered the law, were not to be regarded as examples; le&s;t, being led by the blind, ye peri&s;h with them in the ditch of er|ror and perdition?</P>
<P>When I &s;at down to write you, I had no view of beginning with the&s;e di&s;agreeable re|marks, but &s;imply gave my&s;elf up to the direc|tion of that Wi&s;dom which be&s;t dictates what to &s;ay, and when to &s;ay it: and although &s;ome may object to their being in&s;erted in an Epi&s;tle which points to a general exhortation, I am
<PB N="339" REF="034371_0338_0FFC315E946D4B38">
convinced by undoubted experience, and the example of &s;ome of the mo&s;t eminently &s;ervice|able in the Lord's hand, that Divine wi&s;dom &s;ometimes commands to reprove tho&s;e that of|fend, let them be of what cla&s;s they may, be|fore all, that others may learn to fear. In the authority of Truth I dare a&s;&s;ert that the time is come in our church, when it is nece&s;&s;ary that judgment &s;hould begin as at the hou&s;e of God, in the very highe&s;t cla&s;&s;es of the &s;ociety; and till that is laid to the line, and &s;ome there|in are either reformed thereby or removed from tho&s;e dignified &s;tations, there is little proba|bility of the Lord's work, being carried on to his own honour (in the general) and the com|fort of the faithful. O! &s;aith my &s;oul, that all who are concerned, or concern them&s;elves, therein, would &s;tudy to be quiet and mind their own bu&s;ine&s;s, which is to take heed to them|&s;elves; for although the Holy Gho&s;t may have once made &s;ome of them over&s;eers of the flock, they cannot properly take heed thereto, un|le&s;s this is the ca&s;e; for being them&s;elves load|ed with a &s;ecret con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt, for wor&s;hipping of idols, &s;ome obviou&s;ly, and &s;ome having them concealed under a preci&s;e, for|mal, out&s;ide appearance and deportment, as in the &s;kirts of their garments, they dare not, nay they cannot, &s;earch out the hidden things of E&s;au among the people, nor admini&s;ter judg|ment in righteou&s;ne&s;s, where it is obviou&s;ly due.</P>
<P><PB N="340" REF="034371_0339_0FFC315CB690D770">Let me therefore, in the &s;pirit of go&s;pel meekne&s;s and charity, which breathes for your &s;alvation and enlargement in all the gifts and fruits of the Holy Gho&s;t, exhort you who are of the foremo&s;t ranks, whether mini&s;ters, el|ders, over&s;eers, or heads of families, that you would &s;olemnly look into your&s;elves; and with an impartiality, which ever accompanies tho&s;e who are really concerned for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the kingdom of Chri&s;t in them&s;elves, a&s;k your&s;elves, individually, In what am I lack|ing? O! my friends, was this the ca&s;e with us all, and did we patiently wait for the an|&s;wer of Truth, we &s;hould individually be hum|bled into a &s;en&s;e of our &s;hortne&s;s of that per|fection, whereunto we have been called, and wherein many of us have believed; and &s;ome would be &s;o &s;truck with the view of their ido|latrous revolting from the &s;imple wor&s;hip of the true and living God, that they would go mourning many days in the bitterne&s;s of their &s;ouls; and all would be animated to pre&s;s af|ter the mark for the prize of their high calling in Chri&s;t, which is redemption from the world, the fle&s;h, and the devil. And the nearer we approach to this ble&s;&s;ed and happy experience, the more our hands will be &s;trengthened in the Lord's work, and the more we &s;hall be ena|bled both by precept and example to build one another up in the mo&s;t holy faith, and in tho&s;e things which edify; and our confidence in God who is the Perfecter of his &s;aints will increa&s;e, that, as he hath mercifully begun a good work
<PB N="341" REF="034371_0340_0FFC315A67040598">
in us, he will fini&s;h it to the prai&s;e of his own name.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible that &s;elf-examination by the light of Truth &s;hould hurt any of us, and it may help all. I therefore once more earne&s;tly recommend it, as a means of our fulfilling this precept, "Purge out the old leaven," and enabling us to keep the fea&s;t
<Q>not with the leaven of malice and wickedne&s;s, but with the unleavened bread of &s;incerity and truth.</Q>
I &s;hall conclude my exhortation to you of the&s;e cla&s;&s;es, with &s;aying, Be faithful, and then will you be comforted&punc; and of one mind, and the God of Peace will pre&s;ide among&s;t you. Amen.</P>
<P>Now to you who, not being in any of the before-mentioned &s;tations, may therefore think your&s;elves more at liberty to gratify the de&s;ire of the carnal mind, is my concern directed; with &s;ecret breathings to the Father of mercies, that he may enable me &s;o to point the word to your hearts, that being made &s;en&s;ible of your own danger, you may flee for your lives, from tho&s;e bewitching vanities, and fal&s;e plea&s;ures which have held your &s;ouls in bondage to the God of this world; who, by many &s;ecret &s;nares, and more obvious allurements, &s;eeks to entangle the minds of poor mortals, and lead a&s;tray their affections from that ine&s;timable Fountain of light, life, and happine&s;s, where|in is centered all true joy, both in time and in eternity.</P>
<P>Dearly beloved! for &s;o in the bowels of go&s;pel compa&s;&s;ion I call you; have you ever
<PB N="342" REF="034371_0341_0FFC31578188A3A0">
&s;eriou&s;ly con&s;idered that you have no continu|ing city here; and that as your &s;ouls are im|mortal, it is the proper, and ought to be the principal, bu&s;ine&s;s of your lives, to &s;eek for them a habitation, &s;uitable to their being and nature, wherein they may have a happy re&s;i|dence for ever: which is alone to be found in God, who is the &s;ource and re&s;ource of his people? Now in order that your &s;ouls may at la&s;t centre with God, it is nece&s;&s;ary that they &s;hould be made habitations for Him through the &s;anctifying operation of the Spirit of his Son, which alone can render us who have been defiled with &s;in (and therefore unfitted for a re&s;idence with Him), fit objects of his favour. Allow me therefore to a&s;k you (and O! that you would a&s;k your&s;elves), what you have known of this work, in your experience? Has the &s;pirit of judgment and of burning done its office in your hearts? Have you pa&s;&s;ed through the fir&s;t part of the work of &s;anctifica|tion? I mean the admini&s;tration of condemna|tion for &s;in. Have you been bowed under the te&s;timony of the righteous Witne&s;s of God in your con&s;cience? Or have you not rather de|pre&s;&s;ed and contemned this heavenly me&s;&s;en|ger; not &s;uffering it to tell you the truth, or at lea&s;t, di&s;believing the doctrine it preached, becau&s;e it did not countenance &s;ome of your actions? Nay, have not &s;ome gone &s;o far as to &s;lay the "two witne&s;&s;es for God," the in|ternal evidence of his Spirit, and the external te&s;timony of his &s;ervants; and are perhaps at
<PB N="343" REF="034371_0342_0FFC315544B5C3C8">
this hour exulting in their victory, and pro|claiming to them&s;elves peace; when alas! a day of fearfulne&s;s, amazement, and unuttera|ble angui&s;h, awaits them, and is near; when, if not &s;ooner, the curtains of mortality &s;hall be drawn, and they &s;hall &s;ee the Judge, tre|mendous in maje&s;ty, and that righteous witne&s;s, which in time they &s;lew, rai&s;ed in power, to te&s;tify again&s;t them for their rebellion, and a&s;|&s;ert the ju&s;tice of their exclu&s;ion from the realms of light and ble&s;&s;edne&s;s.</P>
<P>What effect this faint de&s;cription of the day of judgment to the wicked, and tho&s;e who forget God, may have upon the minds of &s;uch, I know not; but my heart being impre&s;&s;ed with an awful &s;en&s;e of its certainty, is animat|ed to endeavour to wre&s;t them from its eter|nal con&s;equences; by per&s;uading them to bow in the day of God's merciful vi&s;itation to their &s;ouls, and to ki&s;s the Son le&s;t he be angry, and they peri&s;h from the way of life and &s;al|vation, ere his wrath be kindled but a little.</P>
<P>Do not vainly and proudly imagine, that you are able to &s;tem the force or Omnipotence. He is, and will be King, whether you are willing to allow him the right of &s;overeignty or not: and his &s;acred laws of unchangeable truth, are as manife&s;t in the puni&s;hment of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, as in the reward of tho&s;e that do well: and O! if it were po&s;&s;ible to con|vey to you a &s;en&s;e of that &s;weet peace, glory, and joy, which are, and &s;hall be revealed to tho&s;e who love and &s;erve God, you would be
<PB N="344" REF="034371_0343_0FFC3152F3C40B70">
convinced that no puni&s;hment could be too great for &s;uch as, by a contrary conduct, &s;light and ca&s;t away &s;o great &s;alvation and hap|pine&s;s. But as no eye can &s;ee, nor heart conceive, the exceeding grace of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, but &s;uch as have happily witne&s;&s;|ed its &s;anctifying operation; I cannot but in|vite you to
<Q>Come, ta&s;te, and &s;ee, that the Lord is good, and that his mercy endureth for ever.</Q></P>
<P>It is true, that in the way to this attain|ment you mu&s;t pa&s;s through judgment; for Zion mu&s;t be redeemed through judgment, and all the converts with righteou&s;ne&s;s, and a portion of indignation and wrath, tribulation and angui&s;h, mu&s;t (con&s;i&s;tently with the law of Divine ju&s;tice), be admini&s;tered to every &s;oul that &s;inneth. But this judgment when received in the day of God's merciful vi&s;itati|on, is &s;ucceeded by &s;uch inexpre&s;&s;ible peace and a&s;&s;urance of Divine favour, as abundantly compen&s;ates for the pains it may have occa&s;i|oned: for of a truth the carnal
<Q>eye hath not &s;een, nor ear heard, nor heart conceiv|ed,</Q>
what good is in &s;tore for tho&s;e who manife&s;t their love to God by their obedience. Believe me, my beloved friends, when I tell you that my heart is &s;trongly engaged for your welfare, as you &s;tand in your various cla&s;&s;es. I feel much more for you than I can write, and would be&s;eech you by the mercies of God, as well as by his judgments, that you would pre&s;ent the whole bodies of your
<PB N="345" REF="034371_0344_0FFC3151667F83B8">
affections unto him, which is no more than your rea&s;onable &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Has he not dealt exceeding bountifully to &s;ome of you of the things of this life? For what cau&s;e think you has he entru&s;ted you with &s;uch abundance? Is it to gratify the lu&s;t of the eye, and the pride of life? Is it to make you haughty, and a&s;&s;ume a &s;uperiority over &s;uch as, in this re&s;pect may be below your&s;elves, but who perhaps may &s;ome of them be higher in the Divine favour? Nay, &s;urely: but in or|der that you may improve this gift to his ho|nour, the good of others, and your own eter|nal advantage; and may be humbled in a &s;en&s;e of the di&s;proportion of your de&s;erts to his mercies. Has he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word"> favoured &s;ome of you with &s;uperior natural abilities? And for what end, but that you might be in a &s;uperior de|gree &s;erviceable in his hand? Has he not af|forded to all a day of merciful vi&s;itation, wherein he has by various means endeavoured to bring you into that fold of immortal re&s;t, wherein he cau&s;es his
<Q>Flocks to feed and lie down be&s;ide the clear &s;treams of &s;alvation?</Q></P>
<P>O &s;aith my &s;oul! that you may con&s;ider his mercies, and make a &s;uitable return for them; that the Mo&s;t High may delight in the pre&s;ent generation, and dwell among the people as in days pa&s;t. O! you of the ri&s;ing generation, Open the doors of your hearts to that Divine Vi&s;itant, who has long &s;tood thereat, and knocked for entrance. Let him prepare them, and he will a&s;&s;uredly &s;pread his table, and ad|mit
<PB N="346" REF="034371_0345_0FFC314F3A15F308">
you to be the happy communicants thereat. Think not that it is too early in life for you to look &s;teadily towards a future &s;tate of exi&s;t|ence; but con&s;ider, that the &s;olemn me&s;&s;age to &s;ummon you from works to rewards, may be &s;ent to you at an early and unexpected hour: and that it therefore behoves you, to be pre|pared to meet the great Judge. My heart is particularly engaged for your welfare, and pained in the con&s;ideration how widely &s;ome of you have deviated from that path of primitive &s;implicity, wherein your worthy predece&s;&s;ors trod. Let me therefore be&s;eech you to &s;eek for the "Good old way" of holine&s;s, and walk therein; that you may experimentally know the
<Q>God of your fathers, and &s;erve him with a perfect heart and willing mind:</Q>
&s;o will his ble&s;&s;ing forever re&s;t upon you, which maketh truly rich, and adds no &s;orrow therewith.</P>
<P>Let the cloud of witne&s;&s;es to the power and unutterable riches of pure religion, prevail with you to &s;ubmit to its holy influence; that you may rightly under&s;tand, and diligently pur&s;ue, the things that belong to your peace here and hereafter. Let the examples of the righteous in all generations, let their peaceful lives, let their happy conclu&s;ion, triumphing over death, hell, and the grave, in a lively and full a&s;&s;urance of faith; let the &s;olemn im|portance of time and eternity, excite you while it is yet day, and light is upon your taberna|cles, to improve it: that you may be number|ed

among&s;t the wi&s;e, who &s;hall &s;hine as the brightne&s;s of the firmament, and may be in|&s;trumental to turn many to righteou&s;ne&s;s, and be as &s;tars for ever and ever.</P>
<P>The negligent and carele&s;s, the &s;tout-heart|ed, and they that are far from righteou&s;ne&s;s, may receive in&s;truction from the event of the like-minded in all generations. Such have not e&s;caped the righteous judgments of the Al|mighty; who has &s;ealed it as a certain truth:
<Q>Verily there is a reward for the righteous; verily he is a God who judgeth the earth.</Q></P>
<P>And now, dear Friends, as in plainne&s;s I have endeavoured to communicate what has freely opened to the &s;everal cla&s;&s;es among you, I would warn all to beware of putting their proper portion far from them; but let each examine, "Is it I; Is it I?" And let not the iniquities of others, which &s;ome may ob&s;erve to be &s;truck at, tend to fix any in a &s;tate of &s;elf-&s;ecurity; for a&s;&s;uredly every one mu&s;t &s;uf|fer for his own tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. Nor let tho&s;e clo&s;e hints which are pointed to &s;ome of the foremo&s;t rank, be made u&s;e of to invalidate the te&s;timony of &s;uch, whom the Lord has pre&s;erved as "watchmen upon your walls." I know and am thankful that he has a rem|nant among&s;t you, of all ranks, whom he has pre&s;erved near unto him&s;elf; unto whom my &s;oul is united in the tribulations and rejoicings of the go&s;pel; and unto whom a &s;alutation reaches forth, and &s;eems expre&s;&s;ed in my heart thus, Brethren and &s;i&s;ters, be of good cheer,
<PB N="348" REF="034371_0347_0FFC314A756DDB40">
"be patient, and hope to the end:" for the hand of that God whom you &s;erve, is &s;tretch|ed out for your help; and if you abide faith|ful to him, in his own time he will crown your &s;ufferings with rejoicing.</P>
<P>Finally, dearly beloved, farewel; and may the grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the love of God, and the fellow&s;hip of the Holy Gho&s;t, be with you all, Amen.</P>

<P>IT having lately been my lot to pa&s;s through your quarter, and with &s;orrow to ob&s;erve the declining &s;tate of the church therein, I find my mind engaged to write a few lines to you who may be accounted its ruling members; to advi&s;e, that you be careful to fill up the &s;ta|tion of governors in all humility and hone&s;|ty, acquitting your&s;elves like men concerned for the cau&s;e of God. And in order that each may find his hands made &s;trong for the work, let fir&s;t a &s;trict &s;crutiny be made into your own conduct, to &s;ee how far you are purged from the abominations which are committed: for, except tho&s;e who are rulers in I&s;rael, &s;upport their te&s;timony by a circum&s;pect conver&s;ation; it &s;eems to me impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould rule well. For, not pre&s;erving a &s;en&s;e of the nece&s;&s;ity of an entire purity &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in the church, they will be apt to admit of things incon&s;i&s;tent with the nature of that holy principle we profe&s;s; and wink at, in&s;tead of reproving, the conduct of back&s;liders. And, indeed, I &s;ee no right that a man who breaks the law him&s;elf, has
<PB N="350" REF="034371_0349_0FFC3146158425F0">
to &s;it in the &s;eat of judgment. He may plead the example of the Scribes and Phari&s;ees, but no Chri&s;tian precept countenances &s;uch a prac|tice: for
<Q>except our righteou&s;ne&s;s exceeds theirs, we &s;hall in no wi&s;e enter the king|dom.</Q>
And I think it may not be ami&s;s, in order to evince whether there be any re&s;em|blance betwixt us and them, to examine what their righteou&s;ne&s;s was. It was only a bare external righteou&s;ne&s;s, put or kept on with a ba&s;e hypocritical de&s;ign, to impo&s;e upon the people. Spiritual pride was cloked under it. They loved the places of chief pre&s;iden|cy in the &s;ynagogues, &amp;c. and to be called of men, "Rabbi;" oppre&s;&s;ed the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and neglected the weightie&s;t matters of the law, viz. ju&s;tice, mercy, and truth (without which no right government can ever be admini&s;tered). They were not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of holine&s;s, though they made
<Q>broad their philacteries, and en|larged the borders of their garments.</Q>
How different to this is the character of a bi&s;hop<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Or, as it may be tran&s;lated, <HI>over&s;eer.</HI></NOTE> given by the apo&s;tle, viz.
<Q>He mu&s;t be blame|le&s;s as the &s;teward of God, not &s;elf-willed, not &s;oon angry, not given to wine, no &s;trik|er, not given to filthy lucre; but a lover of ho&s;pitality, a lover of good men, &s;ober, ju&s;t, holy, temperate, holding forth the faithful word as he has been taught; that he may be able by &s;ound doctrine both to exhort and convince the gain&s;ayers.</Q>
An excellent ca|talogue
<PB N="351" REF="034371_0350_0FFC31432A991720">
of nece&s;&s;ary qualifications! May both you and I covet to obtain them.</P>
<P>It &s;eems to me that a great regulation is wanting among&s;t us, and judgment mu&s;t begin as at the &s;anctuary, before it can go on right. The camp is &s;hamefully defiled, and few fit to mini&s;ter judgment in wi&s;dom, to the tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ors; which is very much wanting, for
<Q>weak|ne&s;s has reached to the head and the heart,</Q>
and in&s;en&s;ibility &s;eized many of the members. Ari&s;e and &s;hake your&s;elves, le&s;t you peri&s;h with the multitude; and being partakers of the &s;ins of Babylon, ye be al&s;o partakers in her plagues: for I verily believe, the Lord is on his way to try the foundations of the profe&s;&s;|ors of his Truth, that their deeds may be made manife&s;t, whether they are wrought in God or not; and the cau&s;e of his &s;uffering &s;eed will be e&s;pou&s;ed and pleaded, and their wrongs re|dre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Alas! my friends, it will not do for us to have been once called and animated of God. Except we dwell under the teachings of that anointing, and wait for renewed bapti&s;m to &s;it us for further &s;ervice, we &s;hall become dwarf|i&s;h, dry, and formal; and though to an inju|dicious eye, we may appear as flouri&s;hing trees; upon examination by a wi&s;e ob&s;erver, good fruit will not be found upon us, &s;uch as that its flavour will demon&s;trate, that the tree has its nouri&s;hment from the Eternal Fountain of life and wi&s;dom.</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="034371_0351_0FFC314197B5F628">Have a care, le&s;t the world ca&s;t a mi&s;t be|fore your eyes, and hinder your keeping a &s;ight of that tran&s;cendent excellency which is in the Truth; which once engaged &s;ome of you to follow it, with &s;incere de&s;ires to know your &s;pi|rits leavened into its pure nature. Remember the day of your e&s;pou&s;als, and al&s;o, that, as &s;aith the apo&s;tle,
<Q>If any man draw back, my &s;oul &s;hall have no plea&s;ure in him.</Q></P>
<P>Let none judge that the&s;e lines proceed from a &s;elf-&s;ufficiency in me; for I think that I re|tain a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of my weakne&s;s, and unfitne&s;s as a woman for &s;uch a &s;ervice; but I tru&s;t &s;ome of you know that the wind bloweth when and where it li&s;teth.</P>
<P>I am, with the &s;alutation of unfeigned love to the true &s;eed of God among&s;t you, &s;incere|ly de&s;iring their pre&s;ervation, and that the un|faithful may be warned in time, and turn to the Lord in the day of his mercy, your friend and &s;i&s;ter in the Truth,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>E&s;teemed Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS I have had &s;ome cau&s;e to doubt the rec|titude of our determination of not &s;pending a night at thy hou&s;e, I am inclined to e&s;&s;ay a few lines, as a friendly &s;alutation, as well as to in|timate what appeared to me proper to recom|mend to thy con&s;ideration and practice. As a member of &s;ociety, di&s;engaged from the nece&s;|&s;ity of being much employed in worldly bu&s;i|ne&s;s, it behoves thee to attend &s;teadily to the filling up that &s;tation in the church, for which Divine Wi&s;dom de&s;igned thee; that, glorify|ing him with thy body, &s;pirit, and &s;ub&s;tance, thou maye&s;t, in the conclu&s;ion of time, receive the an&s;wer of "Well done good and faithful &s;ervant;" which tho&s;e are not likely to be fa|voured with, who
<Q>dwell in their cieled hou&s;|es,</Q>
and &s;ettled down in the enjoyment of their temporal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, while the Lord's hou&s;e lies wa&s;te.</P>
<P>There are &s;o few who are of clean hands, and are therefore fit to take part in the active
<PB N="354" REF="034371_0353_0FFC313D1C0399B0">
&s;ervices in the church; that I cannot but regret the lo&s;s of &s;ome who are &s;eeking concealment, contenting them&s;elves with pre&s;erving a fair character among&s;t men, and attending on the external duties of religion; but who, had they devoted their faculties to the Lord's &s;ervice, might have been girded for it, and &s;tood as in the front of the battle. Thus, clothed with concern for the welfare of their fellow mem|bers in &s;ociety, their zeal for the promotion of Truth would, in an e&s;pecial manner, be mani|fe&s;ted by an engagement to clean&s;e the camp from tho&s;e who bring a reproach on our holy profe&s;&s;ion; and for the pre&s;ervation of our youth from the &s;nares of the enemy. Well, my friend, it is with me to query whether thou ha&s;t taken thy proper &s;hare in this work, or ha&s;t been excu&s;ing thy&s;elf, and leaving it to others.</P>
<P>I know nothing by outward information, but as &s;omething like a jealou&s;y re&s;ted on my mind re&s;pecting thee, I am willing to intimate it; at the &s;ame time a&s;&s;uring thee of my e&s;teem for thee, as one of the Lord's vi&s;ited children; who, I hope, ha&s;t been in a good degree pre|&s;erved
<Q>from the corruptions that are in the world through lu&s;t;</Q>
and ha&s;t received a portion of that precious faith, which in all ages has been delivered to the &s;aints, through which &s;ome in the pre&s;ent day have obtained a good report, and been rendered very &s;erviceable: whether thou mighte&s;t not have &s;tood among&s;t tho&s;e cho&s;en, and (&s;hall I &s;ay) dignified &s;er|vants, it behoves thee to inquire. Mu&s;t the
<PB N="355" REF="034371_0354_0FFC313A411E4910">
poor and the illiterate, who are "rich in faith" and good works, be brought to condemn tho&s;e among&s;t us who have received much &s;piritually, naturally, and temporally? Yea, verily: &s;ome of the&s;e have done &s;o little that the &s;ins of omi&s;&s;ion mu&s;t be chargeable upon them; whil&s;t others who have had to &s;truggle under difficul|ties in regard to temporal things, and appear|ed comparatively to be of but low under&s;tand|ings, have come up nobly in the Lord's cau&s;e, and &s;hone as &s;tars in the firmament of his pow|er. Well, my friend, look to thy part of the work, and &s;olemnly attend to the filling up thy mea&s;ure in righteou&s;ne&s;s.
<Q>Let no man take thy crown.</Q></P>
<P>Something of this &s;ort &s;eemed to point to|wards thee; and in that love which &s;eeketh thy increa&s;ing in the increa&s;es of God, do I communicate it; and now add a few words in regard to thy wife, for whom thou art doubt|le&s;s tenderly concerned, and, con&s;idering her delicate con&s;titution, maye&s;t ju&s;tly fear the con|&s;equences of her nur&s;ing unavailing &s;orrow. I wi&s;h &s;he would imitate David, who, when the child was dead, aro&s;e and wa&s;hed him&s;elf and ate: for it is no doubt acceptable to kind Pro|vidence, that when we are deprived of one temporal ble&s;&s;ing, we &s;hould humbly rejoice in tho&s;e which remain, and &s;ay with Job, The Lord gave and hath taken away, and ble&s;&s;ed be his name. Hath he not a right to recal what he hath lent us? But unprofitably to &s;ink under &s;uch &s;trokes of his hand, appears to

me to &s;avour of the &s;orrow of the world, which worketh death, &s;ometimes both to body and &s;pirit, if per&s;i&s;ted in. I therefore beg &s;he will look from the beloved object, now no more her's; and con&s;ider how graciou&s;ly the Father of mercies hath dealt with him, in removing him thus early from this &s;tate of conflicts. When our attention is rightly turned to con&s;i|der what is lacking in our&s;elves, we are not &s;o &s;ubject unprofitably to ruminate on circum&s;tan|ces like the&s;e; but, being principally concerned to be prepared to participate in the happine&s;s of tho&s;e "who die in the Lord," &s;hall de&s;ire that all may finally
<Q>work together for our good.</Q></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Re&s;pected Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I CONCLUDE this will meet thee prepar|ing to return to thy native country; and I wi&s;h thy mind may be impre&s;&s;ed with a due &s;en&s;e of the mercies of God vouch&s;afed to thee in this land, and with an awful inquiry whe|ther thou ha&s;t &s;o profited therein, as to return to thy own, wi&s;er and better than thou left it. I am a&s;&s;ured that thou ha&s;t been favoured with a Divine vi&s;itation, intended to &s;ubdue thy na|tural will, regulate thy affections, and bound thy pur&s;uits after the acqui&s;ition of either inte|re&s;t, plea&s;ures, or knowledge, merely terre|&s;trial; and &s;o to reduce the whole man, that thy mind, being bent upon higher attainments than what would only gratify the natural will and de&s;ires, might become capable of enjoying the one only unmixed &s;upreme good; and, being devoted to the &s;ervice of its bounteous Creator and Benefactor through time, might

participate with him in unchangeable happine&s;s when it terminates. I intreat thee to inquire how far this glorious end has been accompli&s;h|ed and do not &s;light that great &s;alvation, which in infinite mercy has been offered thee. I fear thy views have been after that honour which is of men, and that the wi&s;dom which will one day be manife&s;ted to be fooli&s;hne&s;s, has been preferred to that which is pure, and which therefore &s;o recommends to the Lord's favour, as to make men his friends. He has favoured thee with natural gifts, which, if &s;anctified by his refining Spirit, might render thee u&s;eful in time. Con&s;ider how they have been employed, for be a&s;&s;ured, thou wilt one day &s;ee that, where much is given, much will be required, and that, "mighty men," if they counteract the de&s;ign of their creation, will be "mightily tormented" with pungent and un|availing remor&s;e. Therefore prize the day of the Lord's vi&s;itation to thy &s;oul, and &s;olemnly attend to the "reproofs of in&s;truction," as the alone way to true happine&s;s, both in time and eternity.</P>

<HEAD>EPISTLE X. To B. H.&mdash;York&s;hire.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THY affectionate &s;alutation of the 7th ult. I received and read with a degree of &s;atisfac|tion, as it evinced I lived in the remembrance of an ab&s;ent friend. When &s;piritual &s;ympathy is felt with each other, it &s;trengthens the hope of our being continued in the holy member&s;hip of the living body of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Sometime before the receipt of thine, I had been clo&s;ely tried, and, although I am fa|voured to know on whom to depend for &s;uc|cour and &s;upport, encouragement from my fellow-travellers Sion-ward, is truly accepta|ble. There are &s;ea&s;ons, wherein I doubt not but it is a cordial to the mo&s;t advanced; but as for me, I many times fear I am behind &s;ome who have not been called to &s;tand forth &s;o con|&s;picuou&s;ly in the front of the battle; but who&s;e hidden life may be with Chri&s;t, in a greater degree than mine, or &s;ome others who have moved in an active &s;phere. Certainly to
<PB N="361" REF="034371_0360_0FFC312D9259BD18">
be called up into active &s;ervice, is a token of Divine approbation; but if any &s;ervants who have thus been frequently di&s;tingui&s;hed, &s;hould mea&s;ure them&s;elves by the &s;ervices they have been a&s;&s;i&s;ted to perform, they may and will cen|tre in deception, re&s;pecting their real &s;piritual &s;tate; and may clothe them&s;elves with the Lord's jewels, when they are not adorned with the truly beautiful covering of humility, and a fear of endeavouring to appear to be any thing but what they are through his grace. Thus &s;elf-con&s;equence may get up, and if &s;uch are not watchful, it will get up, and occa&s;ion pain to the truly feeling, though le&s;s active members of the church. My &s;incere and ear|ne&s;t de&s;ire is, and indeed for a &s;eries of years has been, for pre&s;ervation from it, and that I may con&s;tantly centre in my own littlene&s;s, yea no|thingne&s;s: for indeed in my fle&s;h dwelleth no good thing. All good, and the power of &s;hewing it forth, is of and from its own Divine &s;ource. Who are great, but tho&s;e whom the Lord &s;ees meet to dignify? All is the effect of his wi&s;dom, power, and mercy: therefore to him be the prai&s;e, &s;aith my &s;oul; and may I ever humbly confe&s;s before him, that I am no|thing, nor can do any thing, but as he puts me forth.</P>
<P>Dear Friend, the work of purification is a great and deep work. May we attend to it, and not &s;eek great things to our&s;elves, either &s;piritually, naturally, or temporally, that we may be di&s;tingui&s;hed among men; but be con|cerned,
<PB N="362" REF="034371_0361_0FFC312C093ADE88">
that the in&s;ide-work of the temple may be completed; and the out&s;ide will not want the ornaments Divine wi&s;dom de&s;igned it; but we &s;hall move and act in the church in pure go&s;pel &s;implicity, which will ever tend to its edification.</P>
<P>I was glad to receive a late account that T. Colley and his companion were returned from their perilous voyage. I al&s;o hope that there may be &s;ome occa&s;ion to rejoice, that the Lord is vi&s;iting his people in your country (once di&s;tingui&s;hed for its worthies in I&s;rael), becau&s;e I hear there are divers late appearances in the mini&s;try among you. May the &s;pirit of the departed Elijahs, &s;o re&s;t upon &s;ome of the pre|&s;ent generation, that they may go forth in the &s;ame &s;pirit and power wherein they acted; and become in&s;trumental to turn the
<Q>hearts of the di&s;obedient to the wi&s;dom of the ju&s;t.</Q>
A truly living baptizing mini&s;try, is much wanted among us; but except the Lord in mercy favour us with &s;uch a mini&s;try, &s;ilence in our &s;olemn meetings is far preferable. Alas! few, very few indeed, of the pre&s;ent warriors appear to be thoroughly accoutered for the battle of the day. Some are e&s;&s;aying to go forth as in Saul's armour, the wi&s;dom of men decorated with literature; but it will not do the Lord's work. Weapons de&s;pi&s;ed by the worldly wi&s;e, are far more efficacious; and although the u&s;ers of them may be de&s;pi&s;ed al&s;o, they are cho&s;en to confound the human wi&s;dom of &s;uch, and, if they keep within the
<PB N="363" REF="034371_0362_0FFC3128929631A8">
bounds of his appointment, will glorify his name.</P>
<P>I doubt not but that many of my friends in York&s;hire, will be plea&s;ed to know that I am better in health than when la&s;t in London. I had a long &s;ea&s;on of weakne&s;s after that journey, and am yet weak, compared to what I have been.

<OPENER><SALUTE>E&s;teemed Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE &s;ympathy I have repeatedly felt with thy exerci&s;ed mind hath rai&s;ed earne&s;t de&s;ires in mine, that Divine goodne&s;s may vouch&s;afe more fully to open thy under&s;tanding into the "work of righteou&s;ne&s;s," and &s;o enlarge thy experience therein, that thou maye&s;t witne&s;s it to be "peace," and the effects of it
<Q>quiet|ne&s;s and a&s;&s;urance for ever.</Q></P>
<P>Many are the &s;tratagems of the &s;ubtil ad|ver&s;ary of our happine&s;s to prevent our at|taining to this de&s;irable &s;tate, which are only manife&s;ted by the light of Truth; whereunto I have wi&s;hed thy mind might be effectually turned, and thy dependance fixed &s;olely upon the one &s;ure everla&s;ting Helper. For while thou art &s;eeking after men for in&s;truction, and a &s;ettlement in the true faith, thou wilt be liable to be to&s;&s;ed to and fro by the various
<PB N="365" REF="034371_0364_0FFC3124CA9CF6F8">
and oppo&s;ite doctrines preached; and though ever hearing, maye&s;t never come to the know|ledge of the Truth in its native &s;implicity. Permit me, therefore, in true love, to intreat thee to cea&s;e from them, and humbly to wait upon the unerring Teacher, who can and will "guide thee into all Truth," if thou art di&s;|po&s;ed implicitly to follow him.</P>
<P>It appears to me more nece&s;&s;ary now for thee to &s;eek after re&s;ignation to the Divine will, than to &s;earch into comments upon points of doctrine: for until we attain to that &s;tate, we are not likely to
<Q>receive the kingdom of God as little children;</Q>
who, knowing no|thing, are to be in&s;tructed from one point of knowledge and duty to another, and are pa&s;|&s;ive to the direction of their tutors. Tho&s;e who are re&s;igned to the Father's will, are to know of the doctrines of the &s;on: unto the&s;e they are marvellou&s;ly opened and &s;ealed, &s;o that they can &s;ay they believe, not becau&s;e of the te&s;timony of others, but have
<Q>the wit|ne&s;s in them&s;elves</Q>
that they are the doc|trines of Truth; and thus believing they enter into re&s;t, being certain that they have acquired the knowledge of the Truth; and pre&s;&s;ing for|ward under its influence, they experience a gradual advancing to the
<Q>&s;tature of manhood in Chri&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>It is this holy certainty I de&s;ire thou maye&s;t be partaker of, with tho&s;e who are building upon the ancient
<Q>foundation of the apo&s;tles and prophets;</Q>
for &s;uch there are in the
<PB N="366" REF="034371_0365_0FFC3121F6B055F0">
pre&s;ent time as &s;urely as there were in the pri|mitive ages of the church; who know Je&s;us Chri&s;t to be the "Chief Corner &s;tone," and build upon him, and rejoice in him, as their leader, feeder, and in&s;tructor; through whom they wor&s;hip the Father in &s;pirit and in truth; and look up to Him in all afflictions and exer|ci&s;es, in humble confidence, that as a tender Father, he careth for them and will &s;upply all their wants.</P>
<P>Thus it was, in the morning of our day as a people, that many &s;incere &s;ouls who had long wandered upon the mountains of profe&s;&s;ion, and been exerci&s;ed in various forms of godli|ne&s;s, &s;eeking re&s;t, but not finding it therein, obtained a &s;ettlement in the Truth as it is now profe&s;&s;ed among&s;t us, which they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and rejoiced therein. For although the pub|lick profe&s;&s;ion of it expo&s;ed them to many and grievous &s;ufferings both in per&s;on and e&s;tate; as well as to the general contempt of the world, who&s;e cu&s;toms and manners they were con&s;trained to contradict, by a conduct and be|haviour directly oppo&s;ite thereto; they being devoted to &s;uffering for the te&s;timony of a good con&s;cience, were favoured with that true peace which the world cannot give; and in noi&s;ome pri&s;ons livingly prai&s;ed Him who had called them, not only to believe in Chri&s;t and his doctrines, but to &s;uffer for him. Many of the&s;e have left faithful records of their &s;uffer|ings, exerci&s;es, and experiences of the merci|ful dealings of the Lord with their &s;ouls;
<PB N="367" REF="034371_0366_0FFC31206B852CA0">
which may be as marks in the way to tho&s;e who are &s;incerely &s;eeking the &s;ame city which was prepared for them, and tend to &s;trengthen their re&s;olution to walk as they did; in holy &s;elf-denial, in contempt of the world, and in reverence and fear of offending Him, who had graciou&s;ly manife&s;ted him&s;elf to them as a God of infinite loving-kindne&s;s. His compa&s;&s;ion, my friend, faileth not, but all who will come may come, and upon the terms of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his will, experience Him to blot out their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and be a Father unto them. In Him is no variablene&s;s, neither &s;hadow of turning: and if we of the pre&s;ent generation cleave &s;teadily to Him, and are willing to die that we may live, we may be witne&s;&s;es in our day to his power and mercy, and have to tell unto others, what he has done for our &s;ouls.</P>
<P>I herewith &s;end thee a collection of me|moirs, &amp;c. of one who had been under vari|ous forms and profe&s;&s;ions of religion; and was in no mean &s;tation in the &s;everal religious &s;o|cieties, which in que&s;t of real peace he left; whereof I reque&s;t thy candid peru&s;al. I was induced to this freedom by frequently remem|bering thee, as I lately read &s;ome of them, which &s;eemed adapted to an exerci&s;ed mind; and hope thou wilt con&s;true it as intended for a help to &s;ettle thine in a right engagement be|fore the Lord; unto who&s;e wi&s;dom I com|mend thee, only de&s;iring thou maye&s;t be bap|tized into that &s;tate, wherein, with the Cap|tain of our &s;alvation, thou maye&s;t be able to

&s;ay, "Father, glorify thy Name," by my en|tire &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to thy will.</P>
<P>I hope thou wilt not &s;uppo&s;e from any of the foregoing ob&s;ervations, that I confine the peculiar favour of God, to the members of our &s;ociety, to the exclu&s;ion of others. No, I believe that among&s;t all &s;orts of people,
<Q>tho&s;e who fear God and work righteou&s;ne&s;s are accepted of Him:</Q>
but as faithfulne&s;s agreeable to knowledge is the terms of our ac|ceptance, it behoves us to &s;eek earne&s;tly for &s;trength to do, as well as to be de&s;irous to know, the heavenly Father's will; and who|ever is thus &s;incerely exerci&s;ed is likely to at|tain to his &s;alvation. I am &s;orrowfully &s;en&s;ible of the great declen&s;ion there is among&s;t us as a religious &s;ociety, from primitive purity and love to God; neverthele&s;s, the principle of light and life we profe&s;s, is unchangeably the &s;ame; and there are yet with us, who, moving under its influence, rejoice in the manife&s;tation thereof to their &s;ouls. That others under the &s;ame profe&s;&s;ion &s;hould run counter thereto, is no more than may be expected, though much to be lamented; for as now many hold the profe&s;&s;ion from education, and are born with pa&s;&s;ions like other men, until tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions come under Divine re&s;triction, they will pro|duce their natural fruits.</P>
<P>I conclude with de&s;iring, that
<Q>the God of all con&s;olation, who rai&s;ed from the dead our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the great and true Shepherd of his own &s;heep,</Q>
may &s;o manife&s;t

and arrive to &s;uch an e&s;tabli&s;hment in righteou&s;ne&s;s as to be favoured with true peace, and &s;incerely &s;ub|&s;cribe my&s;elf thy friend,</P>

<SALUTE>E&s;teemed Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE &s;everal times thought of writ|ing thee &s;ince our return from Bri&s;tol, but till now have neglected it; and as I know not but we may pretty &s;oon turn homewards, it may appear the le&s;s needful for me to do it; but as my mind &s;till bends towards thee, in an affec|tionate concern for thy more firm e&s;tabli&s;hment in the Truth, I am willing to tell thee &s;o, and earne&s;tly reque&s;t thy con&s;tant attention to its dictates; that thereby thou maye&s;t be led out of corrupt &s;elf in all its appearances, and con|&s;equently, into that holy &s;implicity of mind and manners, which characteri&s;es a di&s;ciple of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="371" REF="034371_0370_0FFA6CA10403FFF8">I have been much afraid le&s;t thou &s;hould &s;ettle down in a partially converted &s;tate, and after having deeply ta&s;ted of the terrors of the Lord for pa&s;t &s;ins, which indeed were &s;lagrant, &s;hould&s;t content thy&s;elf with for&s;aking them, and neglect to pre&s;s after inward righteou&s;|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>I hope thou wilt excu&s;e me for being thus plain with thee, and that I &s;hall explain my meaning in &s;ome degree to thy &s;atisfaction, when I tell thee, that the ob&s;ervations I have made at thy aiming after grandeur or &s;hew, in thy appearance and furniture, has given me pain, as I know it to be the fruit of a mind not truly or fully humbled.</P>
<P>In the general, in the infancy of religion, when conviction for pa&s;t offences has gone deep enough, the mind is very &s;crupulous and fear|ful of receiving a fre&s;h wound by the indul|gence of the natural inclination; and fre|quently is led into &s;o &s;trait a path, that when it has been well di&s;ciplined by the cro&s;s, a little more liberty is allowed in the u&s;e of &s;ome things, which in that &s;tate it was re&s;trained from. This has appeared to me as pa&s;&s;ing un|der the di&s;pen&s;ation of John the Bapti&s;t, which was preparatory to that of Chri&s;t, and mu&s;t be experienced in our religious progre&s;s. For, although the nece&s;&s;ity of the outward &s;hadowy bapti&s;m cea&s;e, we mu&s;t be plunged in Jordan, the river of judgment: and as John appeared in great au&s;terity and mortification, having
<Q>a garment of camel's hair, and a leathern gir|dle
<PB N="372" REF="034371_0371_0FFC3117907DEC80">
about his loins, and his meat was locu&s;ts and wild honey;</Q>
&s;o renewed minds mu&s;t know that life to be &s;lain, which delights it|&s;elf in grand appearances and delicacies, and be content with mean things; &s;o as to walk in contrariety to the world, and be &s;eque&s;ter|ed from it, as John was in the wilderne&s;s. And under this di&s;pen&s;ation of mortification, the mountains and hills are brought down, and the vallies are exalted, and the way of the Lord is prepared; unto which, as the &s;oul is reconciled, rough ways are rendered &s;mooth, and crooked paths &s;traight; and the &s;alvation of God is revealed; and there is an entering into the innocent liberty of the Lord's chil|dren, in the u&s;e of his creatures. For al|though
<Q>John came neither eating nor drink|ing,</Q>
the Lord Je&s;us came
<Q>eating and drinking,</Q>
yet in reverence and fear; and though he was
<Q>Lord of all, he became of no reputation,</Q>
and took upon him the appearance of a &s;ervant.</P>
<P>Well, my friend, the&s;e things are written for our in&s;truction, and are worthy our atten|tive con&s;ideration, that we may &s;ee whether we are endeavouring to enter
<Q>through the gate into the city</Q>
of the &s;aints &s;olemnities. We read,
<Q>Strait is the gate, and narrow is the way which leads to life;</Q>
and alas!
<Q>few find it.</Q>
The indulgence of the fle&s;hly mind and natural inclination, prevents many from &s;ee|ing it; and though &s;ome have &s;een it, they have not &s;teadily per&s;evered in &s;triving to enter in; and
<PB N="373" REF="034371_0372_0FFC3115587C5F20">
therefore have re&s;ted &s;hort of that perfected righteou&s;ne&s;s they had once a pro&s;pect of. Let not this be thy ca&s;e, but earne&s;tly de&s;ire that thy under&s;tanding may be fully opened in|to this holy highway which leads to the king|dom, and thine eye be pre&s;erved &s;ingle to God's honour, that thou maye&s;t be enabled &s;o to run as to obtain the glorious crown of im|mortality.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider thou ha&s;t &s;et out late in this impor|tant race, and therefore it behoves thee to u&s;e great diligence in endeavouring to overcome thy &s;piritual enemies; all of which will be manife&s;t|ed, as thine eye is &s;ingle, for then thy
<Q>whole body will be full of light:</Q>
&s;o that thou will be pre&s;erved from entering into a league with &s;uch of the old inhabitants of thine heart, as are appointed to utter de&s;truction.</P>
<P>The I&s;raelites were deceived by the appear|ance of the wily Gibeonites, thinking them to have come from a far country, when they were near neighbours; as many, for want of cau|tious watching in the light, which maketh ma|nife&s;t what is hurtful in its tendency, have been deceived, and united with tho&s;e di&s;po&s;itions, in one &s;hape or another, which were for judg|ment.</P>
<P>And it ju&s;t pre&s;ents further to &s;ay, Beware of that which is without the &s;acred limits of di|vine pre&s;cription. So wilt thou be pre&s;erved from all the &s;nares of a &s;ubtil enemy, who, &s;o long as he is permitted to tempt us, can &s;uit his baits to every &s;tation and &s;ituation of life, and
<PB N="374" REF="034371_0373_0FFC311326B67620">
to every &s;tage of our religious experience: which manife&s;ts the propriety of our Saviour's precept, not only to one but to all of his di&s;|ciples,
<Q>Watch and pray that ye enter not in|to temptation.</Q></P>

<P>ALTHOUGH I have not written to thee &s;ince the commencement of thy pre&s;ent &s;orrow|ful &s;tate, thou can&s;t not be ignorant of my &s;ym|pathy with thee; and con&s;idering my increa&s;ed debility for writing (of which I advi&s;ed thy mo|ther), I might have hoped that thou would&s;t not have waited for my doing it before thou had&s;t addre&s;&s;ed me: if but with a few lines, they would have been very acceptable; e&s;pe|cially &s;o, if they had breathed a &s;pirit of acqui|e&s;cence with the will of the All-wi&s;e di&s;po&s;er of events. He knows be&s;t on what to lay his hand, in order to facilitate his merciful de&s;igns re&s;pecting us; and if he deprives us of what is mo&s;t dear, and which al&s;o may appear to be the mo&s;t valuable and beneficial to us of all his temporal gifts; does he not therein &s;peak this in&s;tructive language, Set your affections on things which are in heaven, and not on things which are upon the earth, which mu&s;t all pa&s;s away in their appointed &s;ea&s;on? They are only lent us as temporary a&s;&s;i&s;tants or ac|commodations in our pa&s;&s;age through time;
<PB N="376" REF="034371_0375_0FFC310E052C4B88">
and although they may be rejoiced in and va|lued as his gifts, they are not to be depended upon or loved beyond the appointed &s;tandard of his wi&s;dom. It is our intere&s;t as well as du|ty, to hold them by the tenure wherewith he has intru&s;ted us with them, viz. to be returned at his call; which always ultimately comports with our real happine&s;s, if
<Q>we look not at the things which are &s;een,</Q>
which, however high we may prize them, are but temporal; but &s;teadily behold, with ardent de&s;ire of po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing, "tho&s;e which are not &s;een" (&s;ave with the eye of faith), "which are eternal." My principal concern for thee is, that this eye may be opened widely in thy &s;oul; that thou maye&s;t &s;ee and rightly e&s;timate all po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions which are attainable by man; and, beholding and contemplating the tran&s;cendent excellency of &s;piritual gifts, maye&s;t covet them earne&s;tly. This is the only allowable covetou&s;ne&s;s, and the mind being thus engaged, becomes tran&s;|formed from a &s;tate of nature to that of grace: agreeably to the apo&s;tle's te&s;timony and expe|rience, viz.
<Q>And we all beholding as in a gla&s;s with open face, the glory of the Lord, are changed into the &s;ame image, from glo|ry to glory, even by the &s;pirit of the Lord.</Q></P>
<P>In this renewed &s;tate the will of the creature is &s;o ab&s;orbed in the will of the Creator, that its life is &s;wallowed up in it; and it does not wi&s;h to enjoy any thing which is not
<Q>freely given to it of God;</Q>
who&s;e in&s;crutable wi&s;|dom bounds its de&s;ires, and under a &s;en&s;e that
<PB N="377" REF="034371_0376_0FFC310C7675AA68">
it knows not what is be&s;t, it refers all thereto, and thus it comes to experience
<Q>new heaven and a new earth</Q>
to be created unto it, "wherein dwelleth righteou&s;ne&s;s;" and it abundantly rejoiceth in that which God creates, as it is &s;en&s;ible that
<Q>he creates Jeru&s;alem (the city of the &s;olemnities of his &s;aints), a rejoicing, and her people a joy.</Q></P>
<P>Dear &mdash;, be not dejected at the pre&s;ent di&s;pen&s;ation of affliction, nor indulge rea&s;oning upon cau&s;es or events, of which thy natural under&s;tanding is incompetent to judge. Re|member that
<Q>the Lord hath a way in the clouds, and a path in the thick darkne&s;s, and his foot&s;teps are not known;</Q>
they can not be fully comprehended by mortals. How vain therefore is the query, Why ha&s;t thou &s;uffered this or that? Yea, is it not wor&s;e than vain, if our temporal intere&s;ts, plea&s;ure, or convenience, are put in competition with his will and wi&s;dom? He can re&s;tore what he de|prives of, or compen&s;ate for it; and often does &s;o abundantly to tho&s;e who &s;incerely de&s;ire that the light and momentary afflictions may work for them a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory, and tend to their increa&s;ing in the pre&s;ent &s;tate in that &s;uperlative ble&s;&s;ing which maketh truly rich, and is unmixed with &s;orrow.</P>
<P>I am per&s;uaded thou ha&s;t &s;een this ble&s;&s;ing, yea, ha&s;t ta&s;ted of it; but remember, this is not enough; thou mu&s;t attentively behold and con&s;ider its worth, and thy de&s;ire to attain it
<PB N="378" REF="034371_0377_0FFC310A46CE3BB8">
mu&s;t be &s;trong and &s;teady. If thou po&s;&s;e&s;s it and hold it fa&s;t, then wilt thou be enabled to &s;ay, "I will not be afraid of evil tidings," nor of the con&s;equence of the lo&s;s of temporal goods of any kind,
<Q>My heart is fixed, tru&s;t|ing in the Lord,</Q>
who upholdeth his chil|dren, and provideth from one &s;tage of life to another, what is meet for their accommodati|ons, and mo&s;t conducive to their acquiring that inheritance which is incorruptible and undefil|ed: whereon I earne&s;tly de&s;ire thy attention and affection may henceforward be &s;o fixed, that thou maye&s;t experience that what has hap|pened, however afflicting to nature, has work|ed together for thy real permanent good.</P>
<P>I was almo&s;t afraid to write to thee, as it appeared like touching a &s;ore which might be a little healed; but I hope my pen has been directed to &s;teer clear of adding to thy pain. I &s;aw nothing of what I have communicated when I began to write.
