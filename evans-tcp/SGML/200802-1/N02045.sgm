<P>Something of this Kind has indeed of late been pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ingly touched upon, but (in my Opinion) con&s;idering the Tendency and Import of that Doctrine, it is there|in too ea&s;ily pa&s;&s;ed over; and the Ab&s;ur|dity and Injuriou&s;ne&s;s thereof not rendred

And the Lord in his Wi&s;dom, and to &s;hew his Power, doth make Souls more or le&s;s honoura|ble, as he plea&s;eth; but 'tis plain, he makes none with De&s;ign to de&s;troy them, both from Scripture and right Rea&s;on.</P>

There was never any Sermon in all the World, preached by any Man &s;ince the Creation, like that of Chri&s;t's. And now, all who make a Profe&s;&s;ion of the holy Name of Je&s;us, are de&s;ir'd and entreated to take a View of the Lives and Conver&s;ations of People, for with tho&s;e who walk mo&s;t con&s;onant to the Doctrine of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, they may mo&s;t &s;afely joyn in Communion and Fellow&s;hip, and in the Wor&s;hip of the Father and the Son with them.

<P>Thus it was in my Mind, and hath been for &s;ome Years, to &s;hew to the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> People, the Weakne&s;s of &s;ome of their own Proofs, (as they ima|gine

<P><PB N="64" REF="002430_0062_0FDB42E627F3C0B0">Oh that People might lay hold of it, and come to Chri&s;t, that they might have Life; for tho' it is Good to &s;earch the Scriptures, 'tis better to come to Chri&s;t. A Man may &s;earch the Scrip|tures, and not come to Chri&s;t as the <HI>Jews</HI> did, <HI>John</HI> 5.39.40. But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f a Man come rightly to Chri&s;t, he will not be negligent in &s;earching the Scriptures, for they contain rich Trea&s;ure to the &s;eeking Soul.
