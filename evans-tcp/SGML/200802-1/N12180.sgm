<P>AMONG a great Variety of Cir|cum&s;tances which the ancient Prophecies declared would mark the Advent of the Me&s;&s;iah; one was, That he &s;hould be u&s;hered in, and his Pre&s;ence announced, by a Me&s;&s;enger, who was to come in the Power and Spirit of Elias, and prepare the Way before him.</P>
<P>THUS the Almighty, when &s;ilencing the Cavils that were then rai&s;ed by Infidelity again&s;t his Providence, and affording Con&s;olation to the Faithful and Pious, declares by the Prophet Malachi,&mdash;<Q>Be|hold, I will &s;end my Me&s;&s;enger, and he &s;hall prepare the Way before me; and the Lord whom ye &s;eek, &s;hall &s;uddenly come to his Temple.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">MALA.

To the &s;ame Purpo&s;e, the &s;ublime and evangelical Prophet I&s;aiah, pointing out the Circum&s;tances preparatory to our Sa|viour's Appearance&mdash;&s;ays&mdash;<Q>The Voice of him that crieth in the Wilderne&s;s, prepare ye the Way of the Lord, make &s;traight in the De&s;ert a Highway for our God.

<P>THESE Words exhibit to us the Idea of a public Herald; who, at the Approach of an illu&s;trious Monarch, commands the Ways to be levelled, and every Thing prepared for his Reception.</P>
<P>THIS metaphorical Language is bor|rowed from a Cu&s;tom which may be traced up to the remote&s;t Antiquity; when Kings &s;ent proper Per&s;ons to prepare Roads, and every Thing el&s;e nece&s;&s;ary for their March.</P>
<P>THUS it is &s;aid of ALEXANDER <HI>the Great,</HI> by an Author who wrote his Hi&s;to|ry<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Arrian.</HI></NOTE>&mdash;<Q>He now marched towards the
<PB N="3" REF="015372_0005_0F98D2CA637B2140">
River Indus, his Army going before, to prepare the Way for him; for other|wi&s;e tho&s;e Places could not have been pa&s;&s;ed over.</Q> Thus al&s;o JOSEPHUS tells us, when Titus marched to be&s;iege Jeru|&s;alem,&mdash;<Q>That there went before him all the Royal Aids, and all the Auxiliaries, and tho&s;e who made the Ways plain.</Q></P>
<P>THIS Prophecy of a Voice crying in the Wilderne&s;s to prepare the Way of the Lord, received its literal Accompli&s;hment in John the Bapti&s;t, who was the Fore|runner and Harbinger of our ble&s;&s;ed Sa|viour.</P>
<P>HE was the Me&s;&s;enger whom the Son of God &s;ent to pepare the Way before him, by preaching the Doctrine of Re|pentance and Reformation. The Bapti&s;t earne&s;tly exhorted to the Practice of Ju&s;|tice, Charity, Benevolence, Humility and Contentment. Hereby Men's Hearts were prepared to receive the Me&s;&s;iah, then ju&s;t on the Point of making his public Appearance. Hereby the Valleys were exalted, Mountains were depre&s;&s;ed, and the crooked Places made &s;traight&mdash;which are only figurative Expre&s;&s;ions to &s;ignify, that the Pride, Self Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Ini|quities of Man were laid low in the Du&s;t; whil&s;t the humble and pious were rai&s;ed to
<PB N="4" REF="015372_0006_0F98D2CAC5229EF8">
the Smiles and Favour of God. The Perver&s;ene&s;s and Folly of Sin and Error were expo&s;ed; tho&s;e Virtues and Truths were inculcated, which would remove every Impediment to a full Reception of the Me&s;&s;iah,&mdash;to an intire Acquie&s;cence in his Di&s;pen&s;ation, which was the la&s;t that God would vouch&s;afe to Mankind.</P>
<P>THE intere&s;ting Doctrines taught by John the Bapti&s;t&mdash;his Declaration that "the Kingdom of Heaven," i. e. the Kingdom of the Me&s;&s;iah, "was at Hand"&mdash;the&s;e, I &s;ay, joined to his extraordinary Sanctity, awakened the Attention of all Men. They eagerly crouded round him, and anxiou&s;ly waited to &s;ee the I&s;&s;ue of tho&s;e remarkable Circum&s;tances. <Q>All the People were in Expectation, &s;ays the Evangeli&s;t; and all Men mu&s;ed in their Hearts of John, whether he were the Chri&s;t or not.</Q></P>
<P>THE Prophecies had pointed out this Period for the coming of the Me&s;&s;iah. Accordingly, there was at this Time an univer&s;al Expectation among the Jews, that the Me&s;&s;iah would &s;hortly appear; as &s;everal Writers, Jewi&s;h and Heathen, expre&s;sly te&s;tify<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">JOSEPHUS, SUETONIUS, TACITUS, &amp;c.</NOTE>. This partly accounts
<PB N="5" REF="015372_0007_0F98D2CB89819FD0">
for the va&s;t Concour&s;e of People which re&s;orted to the Bapti&s;t for In&s;truction, and to receive his Bapti&s;m.</P>
<P>THE Phari&s;ees, the Sadducees, and Publicans came, de&s;iring to be in&s;tructed; and the Bapti&s;t wi&s;ely adapted his In|&s;tructions to their re&s;pective Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>AMONG others, the Soldiers, likewi&s;e demanded of the Bapti&s;t&mdash;<Q>And what &s;hall we do?</Q> His An&s;wer, which I have cho&s;en for my Text, though &s;uited to the peculiar Circum&s;tances of tho&s;e who made the Inquiry, yet when duly explained, will be found to contain the Duty of every Chri&s;tian Soldier. <Q>Do Violence to no Man,</Q> &s;ays the Heaven commi&s;&s;ioned Bapti&s;t, <Q>neither accu&s;e any fal&s;ly; but be content with your Wages.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Who tho&s;e Soldiers were&mdash;whether Heathens or Jews, is a Point on which Commentators are much divided. As it is not a Matter of much Con&s;equence, I &s;hall interfere no further than ju&s;t to mention my Opinion, and briefly &s;et down the Rea&s;ons which &s;upport it. I think it is evident that tho&s;e Soldiers were not idolatrous Heathens; for had they been &s;uch, can we &s;uppo&s;e the Bapti&s;t would not, on their de&s;iring his In&s;tructions, exhort them to renounce Idolatry which was &s;o repugnant to the Spirit of divine Revelation&mdash;&s;o utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with the Wor&s;hip of the true God? From their Attendance on the Bapti&s;t's preach|ing, applying to him for Direction, and probably &s;ubmit|ing to his Bapti&s;m, as the Jews did, it appears that tho&s;e Soldiers were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;ame Principles and Senti|ments, with the Jews of their Time. Hence I conclude they were either Pro&s;elytes to the jewi&s;h Religion, &s;uch as I &s;uppo&s;e CORNELIUS, <HI>Acts</HI> x. and the two CENTURI|ONS, <HI>Matth.</HI> viii, and <HI>Luke</HI> vii, to have been; or el&s;e natural born Jews. Judea was at this Time a Roman Province; and when the State of Things there, during that Period, is duly con&s;idered, there will appear but little Weight in the Objections which are made again&s;t the Sup|po&s;ition that tho&s;e Soldiers were Jews. The Jews, it is true, frequently applied for, and obtained, an Exemption from &s;erving in the Armies of Heathen Princes, on Ac|count of the Difficulties they met with in ob&s;erving the Laws relative to the Sabbath, Di&s;tinction of Meats, &amp;c. Yet it is certain the Jews often went into foreign Ser|vice. A large Body of Jews attended the Army of XER|XES, when he invaded Greece. Many of them &s;erved under ALEXENDER <HI>the Great,</HI> in his A&s;iatic Expeditions. They compo&s;ed a re&s;pectable Corps in the Army of PTO|LOMY when he retreated from Syria, after the Defeat of CELLES, his Lieutenant, by DEMETRIUS; and among them was the celebrated MOSOLLAM, &s;o famous for his Archery. Many other In&s;tances of the &s;ame Kind, and of a later Date, might be produced.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="015372_0008_0F98D2CC449533D8">
THIS I judged a proper Subject to dwell on, when addre&s;&s;ing you, my Brethren, who are now called into the Field, in Defence of legal Government, and of the ju&s;t Authority of your rightful Sovereign&mdash;in Defence of your Lives, Liberties and Property&mdash;of all, in &s;hort, that is dear or valuable to Man on this Side of Hea|ven, which the Hand of Violence, and U&s;urpation would wantonly rend from you.</P>
<P>BEFORE I enter on an Explanation of the Duties recommended in my Text, it may be proper to ob&s;erve, That this Pa&s;&s;age is a full An&s;wer to the crude
<PB N="7" REF="015372_0009_0F98D2CD05708460">
Notions of tho&s;e who a&s;&s;ert the Unlaw|fulne&s;s of War, or of bearing Arms, on any Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>JOHN the Bapti&s;t was commi&s;&s;ioned by the Almighty to prepare the Way for the Me&s;&s;iah's Reception. This arduous office he faithfully di&s;charged, by rebuking Vice and Error boldly, and delivering Truths conducive to this End, by the Authority of Heaven. Unawed by the Power of exalted Station, unbia&s;&s;ed by the &s;pecious Veil of a&s;&s;umed Sanctity, neither of them could &s;creen the Patrons of Vice or Error from his &s;evere Reprehen&s;ions. He rebuked the Phari&s;ees, for their Hy|pocricy and Wickedne&s;s&mdash;the Publicans for their Extortion&mdash;he reproved even Herod for his flagitious Enormities.</P>
<P>Now can it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that when Sol|diers applied to this faithful and intrepid Servant of God for In&s;truction, he would not inform them of the Unlawfulne&s;s of their Profe&s;&s;ion, if indeed it had been unlawful? Had it been di&s;plea&s;ing to God, would he omit declaring it to be &s;o? Would he give Directions for their Conduct in that Profe&s;&s;ion, thereby approving of it, and affording it the Sanction of his Au|thority? No&mdash;This the Bapti&s;t never would
<PB N="8" REF="015372_0010_0F98D2CDC5C81E28">
have done, had the Profe&s;&s;ion of a Sol|dier been incon&s;i&s;tent with Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>IT were indeed mo&s;t devoutly to be wi&s;hed that Ho&s;tilities, and all Occa&s;ions of them, would cea&s;e among the Children of Men&mdash;that Nation might not lift up Sword again&s;t nation, nor learn war any more. But alas! this is a Ble&s;&s;ing not to be looked for in the pre&s;ent State of Things. Ambition, Selfi&s;hne&s;s, Malice, and the other malignant Pa&s;&s;ions of our fallen Nature have a great A&s;cendency over the Judgement, Principles, and Con|duct of Mankind. The&s;e ever have, and it is probable, ever will produce Violence, and unju&s;t Encroachments, in &s;ome; and the&s;e again will make Self-Defence indi&s;|pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary in others.</P>
<P>TO what a dreadful Situation would Mankind be reduced were they precluded from Self-Defence! Society could not po&s;&s;ibly &s;ub&s;i&s;t. The Weak and Helple&s;s would be a Prey to the Strong&mdash;the Peace|able and Indu&s;trious would be &s;ure Vic|tims to every lawle&s;s Invader, who &s;purn|ed the Dictates of Humanity and Ju&s;tice. This whole Earth would be one wretched Scene of Di&s;order, Rapine and Oppre&s;|&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="015372_0011_0F98D2CE84A383E8">
ON the other Hand, I may affirm, that as the beneficent Creator wills the Happine&s;s of his Creatures&mdash;as their Hap|pine&s;s cannot be attained without Society, as Societies cannot be pre&s;erved, nor their Ends obtained, without Self-Defence&mdash;On the&s;e Con&s;iderations I may affirm, that Self-Defence is agreeable to the Will of the Deity. For he that wills the End, mu&s;t will the Means that are nece&s;&s;ary for that End.</P>
<P>BUT enough of this&mdash;I now proceed to unfold the Soldier's Duty, as laid down in my Text.</P>
<P>THE different Profe&s;&s;ions and Stations in human Life, are liable to Temptations peculiar to each: And &s;uch is the Wi&s;|dom and Goodne&s;s of God, that he has given In&s;tructions in his Word, adapted to tho&s;e various Stations; by which the Temptations and Vices, incident to them, may be guarded again&s;t.</P>
<P>THE Soldier, by his Profe&s;&s;ion, is fre|quently called on to face Dangers, and engage in hazardous Conflicts. Hence Courage and Intrepidity are e&s;&s;ential Qua|lifications in his Character. The&s;e when guided by Principles of Benevolence and Ju&s;tice, con&s;titute that generous Magna|nimity,
<PB N="10" REF="015372_0012_0F98D2CF4492B720">
which is one of the greate&s;t Orna|ments of our Nature. Through this, the Soldier becomes the gallant A&s;&s;erter of his Country's injured Rights,&mdash;the Pro|tector of the Innocent, the Scourge and Terror of Oppre&s;&s;ors,&mdash;of the Seditious and Rebellious.</P>
<P>BUT the&s;e Qualities, through the De|pravity of human Nature, &s;ometimes de|generate; they lead Men to oppre&s;s and over-bear, and commit various Di&s;orders.</P>
<P>AGAINST this Abu&s;e, the Injunction in my Text "Do Violence to no Man"&mdash;is directed. The Original Word &s;ignifies to <HI>&s;hake,</HI> or <HI>terrify by &s;haking;</HI> and may be applied to any Kind of unju&s;t Violence, in Order to in&s;ult, oppre&s;s, or forcibly extort Money, or any Sort of Property from others.</P>
<P>ALL this is utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with the Soldier's Duty. Humanity and a Regard to Ju&s;tice, &s;hould direct all his Move|ments; even in the mo&s;t rugged Scenes of War&mdash;for Benevolence and War are per|fectly con&s;i&s;tent. Humanity is ever Cha|racteri&s;tic of true Courage, ju&s;t as Cruelty and Ba&s;ene&s;s are of Cowardice. The greate&s;t Heroes that have figured in Hi&s;to|ry, were no le&s;s di&s;tingui&s;hed by their
<PB N="11" REF="015372_0013_0F98D2D063E600A0">
Humanity and per&s;onal Bravery: And God forbid that &s;o good and righteous a Cau&s;e as you are engaged in, &s;hould ever be di&s;graced by any Action, which is not warranted by Ju&s;tice and true Magna|nimity.</P>
<P>WHEN a Man becomes a Soldier, he cea&s;es not to be a Chri&s;tian, or a Member of Society. The Duties, the Principles of the Chri&s;tian and Citizen, he &s;hould therefore keep in View, and never lo&s;e Sight of them. The&s;e &s;hould regulate his Conduct, whil&s;t vindicating his own civil and religious Rights, and tho&s;e of his Fel|low Citizens, at the Hazard of his Life. And tru&s;t me, that this will be &s;o far from damping his Ardour, or depre&s;&s;ing his Courage, that it will animate both&mdash;it will add Fortitude to his Brea&s;t&mdash;Strength and Vigour to his de&s;cending Arm.</P>
<P>BY this Injunction, all Violence to a Superior, or Di&s;obedience to his Com|mands, is al&s;o forbidden. Subordination is the very Life of military Di&s;cipline; as that again is, humanly Speaking, what will mo&s;t effectually in&s;ure Succe&s;s. The Want of Subordination and Di&s;cipline among our infatuated Adver&s;aries, affords you one very great Advantage over them. Their wild Principles naturally lead to the&s;e and
<PB N="12" REF="015372_0014_0F98D2D1F4AA8370">
other Di&s;orders; and &s;o far tend to defeat the Object they have in View.</P>
<P>FIX it therefore in your Minds, that a chearful, ready Submi&s;&s;ion to the Com|mands of Superiors, and a vigorous Exe|cution of them, is a great and indi&s;pen&s;a|ble Duty of the Chri&s;tian Soldier.</P>
<P>THE next Thing injoined by my Text is, "to accu&s;e no Man fal&s;ly;" which may be done either out of Malice, or Self-In|tere&s;t; thus employing the Authority of others, where our own will not avail, to in|jure our Fellow Creatures. This is &s;o bare-faced a Crime, and of &s;o flagitious a Nature, that I need not enlarge on it. I flatter my&s;elf that your own Hearts revolt again&s;t it in &s;uch a Manner, and you &s;o thoroughly dete&s;t it, that the Nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;&s;uading you from committing it, is there|by &s;uper&s;eded. For what more ba&s;e or abominable, than to give fal&s;e Evidence again&s;t others; thereby to gratify Revenge, or enrich our&s;elves with their Spoils!</P>
<P>I PROCEED therefore to the la&s;t Injunc|tion of my Text&mdash;<Q>Be content with your Wages.</Q></P>
<P>CONTENTMENT with that Station, in which the Will of Providence, and their
<PB N="13" REF="015372_0015_0F98D2D2459CBCB0">
own Choice hath placed them, is the Duty of all Men. A Di&s;regard of this Duty, &s;o clearly inculcated by the united Voice of Revelation and Rea&s;on, is the Source of numberle&s;s Evils&mdash;perhaps of mo&s;t of the Mi&s;eries of human Life.</P>
<P>A DISCONTENTED Mind is never at Re&s;t. It finds Matter to prey upon, and to nou|ri&s;h its Di&s;ea&s;e in every Place, and in every Situation. It &s;ickens under the choice&s;t Ble&s;&s;ings of Earth and Heaven&mdash;The&s;e often &s;erve only to &s;timulate it on in the Pur&s;uit of Mea&s;ures which are utterly &s;ub|ver&s;ive of all Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>O HOW melancholy an In&s;tance of this Truth, does this wretched Country afford at pre&s;ent! Where a Land of Peace and Plenty&mdash;a Land di&s;tingui&s;hed above any other by its Civil and Religious Privileges, is turned into a Field of Blood&mdash;a Scene of Deva&s;tation, Oppre&s;&s;ion and Mi&s;rule&mdash;and all this through the Di&s;content of tho&s;e who were goaded on by Ambition to ri&s;e above their Fellows&mdash;and realize their crude, republican Schemes!</P>
<P>THE Sources of Di&s;content are various. A wrong Bya&s;s of Mind, inordinate Af|fections and De&s;ires, or an overweening Opinion of our&s;elves, which claims more
<PB N="14" REF="015372_0016_0F98D2D30CD4E1B0">
than others think fit to give, frequently produce this unhappy Temper. But it is not my De&s;ign to inve&s;tigate all the Springs from which it is derived; and &s;hall there|fore only mention <HI>two,</HI> which &s;eem to have a particular Relation to my Text.</P>
<P>ONE of tho&s;e is Covetou&s;ne&s;s; which may induce a Soldier to be di&s;&s;atisfied with his Wages, and to de&s;ire more than of Right he can claim. But this is repugnant to every Dictate of Rea&s;on, &s;ince he &s;hould certainly be &s;atisfied with his &s;tipulated Reward. He knew before-hand the Terms on which he engaged: Should he not therefore be content with tho&s;e Terms af|terwards? And certain it is that no Soldi|ers in the Univer&s;e have le&s;s Rea&s;on to be di&s;contented in this Re&s;pect than Briti&s;h Soldiers; for no other State has made &s;uch ample Provi&s;ion for tho&s;e who engage in that Profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE other Cau&s;e of a Soldier's Di&s;con|tent with his Wages, which I alluded to, is Extravagance, or Profu&s;ene&s;s, which his Wages may not be &s;ufficient to &s;upply. When his Expences thus become greater than his Income, it will not only prevent his being content with his Wages; but may al&s;o put him upon u&s;ing unju&s;tifiable Methods to increa&s;e his Income.&mdash;It may
<PB N="15" REF="015372_0017_0F98D2D3C5FA6158">
lead him to do Violence to others, or to accu&s;e them fal&s;ly.</P>
<P>ONE Vice generally makes Way for, and introduces another. Drunkenne&s;s, Di&s;&s;ipation, and criminal Pur&s;uits, involve Men in extravagant Expences beyond their Abilities. They de&s;troy Men's Health, enfeeble the Body, deba&s;e the Mind, and bring on a Neglect of Principle and Duty. Profane Swearing, Di&s;content, Turbulence and Impatience of ju&s;t Re&s;traint, with a long Train of other Evils, are their in&s;e|parable Attendants.</P>
<P>YOU mu&s;t perceive at fir&s;t View how nece&s;&s;ary it is for a Soldier to avoid the&s;e; and how well the Precept in my Text&mdash;"to be content with his Wages"&mdash;is cal|culated to guard again&s;t them. This Pre|ception Fact is the mo&s;t important of any that was delivered by the Bapti&s;t, to the Soldiers; and what effectually &s;ecured an Ob&s;ervation of the Re&s;t. The Soldier who is content with his Wages, re&s;training his De&s;ires and Expences within proper Bounds, is under no Temptation to do Violence to others, or accu&s;e them fal&s;ly.</P>
<P>COLLECTED in him&s;elf, and mindful only of what is his Duty, he is prepared for the vigorous Di&s;charge of it. Anxious
<PB N="16" REF="015372_0018_0F98D2D4865F4190">
to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf in the honourable Pur&s;uit of Fame, and &s;ignalize his Prowe&s;s, he goes on &s;teadily and undaunted. He &s;erves God, while he &s;erves his King and Country; and forgets not that he is a Di&s;|ciple of the holy Je&s;us,&mdash;a Candidate for Eternity, whil&s;t he would gather Laurels in the Field of hardy Conflict.</P>
