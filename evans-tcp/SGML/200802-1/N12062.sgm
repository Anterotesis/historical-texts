<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT is well known, that my &s;ituation in this wilderne&s;s is very remote from the metropolis of this province, for which rea&s;on I have commonly failed of receiving at all, or in &s;ea&s;on, the proclamations given out by government for anniver&s;ary Fa&s;ts and Thank&s;givings; for which rea&s;on I have, at the return of &s;uch &s;ea&s;ons, propo&s;ed to the church and a&s;&s;embly, meeting here, to agree among our&s;elves upon &s;uch days, as we thought to be mo&s;t &s;uitable for &s;uch &s;olemni|ties, and we have ob&s;erved them accordingly; and when I have afterwards received the Governor's proclamation, I have never read it, as we had already performed the very thing de|&s;ired, and required therein, on another day; and &s;uppo&s;ed that a further ob&s;ervation of it was out of the rea&s;on of his procla|mation; and this I have done repeatedly without the lea&s;t of|fence to any, or apprehen&s;ion of danger of its being under&s;tood as expre&s;&s;ive of the lea&s;t di&s;re&s;pect to authority. But this fall, agreeable to the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of North-America, I waited &s;ome time to hear that the Continental Congre&s;s had appointed a day for a general Thank&s;giving, as they had done for a Fa&s;t, in hopes that we might have the plea&s;ure of keeping it in concert with the other colonies, as we did the Fa&s;t, having never heard that they had referred it to the &s;everal colonies to appoint a day for them&s;elves, or that the Congre&s;s of this pro|vince had any de&s;ign to appoint one. While I was thus wait|ing, I accidentally &s;aw a Connecticut print, wherein was the Governor's proclamation appointing the <HI>16</HI>th day of Novem|ber to be ob&s;erved, as a Thank&s;giving in that colony; from whence I thought it rea&s;onable to conclude, they had knowledge of the doings and de&s;ign of that Congre&s;s; and had formed their own appointment accordingly: and as the u&s;ual term was fully
<PB N="vi" REF="015220_0004_0F9784FF1E6B23D0">
come, I did, on Lord's day, November <HI>12</HI>th, propo&s;e to the church, and a full congregation, whether, for the afore-men|tion'd rea&s;ons, it was not &s;ea&s;onable, and would not be mo&s;t likely to act in concert with other colonies, if we &s;hould appoint the &s;ame day as Connecticut had done? And after due delibe|ration, and mentioning and con&s;idering the moral grounds and rea&s;ons inviting and calling us thereto; I put it to their vote, in which the church and congregation concurred in the affirma|tive, <HI>nem. con.</HI> and accordingly that day was publicly and &s;olemnly ob&s;erved by us, as an offering to God, for the many favours and ble&s;&s;ings of his goodne&s;s to us and our land the la&s;t year, agreeable to what had been particularly mentioned and agreed upon when we appointed the day.</P>
<P>On Thur&s;day, the next week, a Delegate returning from the Congre&s;s at Exeter, put into my hand their proclamation ap|pointing the <HI>30</HI>th day of November to be ob&s;erved as a Thank&s;|giving throughout the province. But as we had kept the day, and fully done what was de&s;ired in the proclamation, I con|cluded, as I u&s;ed to do in &s;uch ca&s;es, there would be no occa&s;ion for reading it. The people in this town and Norwich, places neare&s;t to us, having kept thank&s;giving as well as we, and I thought none could think it advi&s;able, nor even lawful to re|peat it; nor the de&s;ire or intention of the congre&s;s, that any, under our circum&s;tances, &s;hould do &s;o; and accordingly I omit|ed reading it on the &s;abbath, Nov. <HI>26,</HI> not expecting a word would ever have been &s;aid about it: But I &s;oon heard there was a great clamour in the neighbourhood, and that it was &s;preading fa&s;t abroad, as though we were like to be all un|done&mdash;that I &s;hould be &s;peedily &s;ent for to Exeter, <HI>150</HI> miles, to an&s;wer for it before the congre&s;s, as a tory, and &s;hould not fail to be judged an enemy to my country, if I did not keep that day as an anniver&s;ary Thank&s;giving, when no rea&s;on was urged for it but purely and &s;olely out of re&s;pect to the advice of the congre&s;s.</P>
<P>On hearing this I &s;ent out and invited my neighbours to
<PB N="vii" REF="015220_0005_0F9784FFCD9EF810">
come and join our evening prayer in the college-hall, and took that opportunity to di&s;cour&s;e them on the head, and appealed to them as my witne&s;&s;es, that I had ever been, from the fir&s;t, &s;teadily and firmly attached to the con&s;titutional rights and li|berties of the colonies, and that upon all proper occa&s;ions I had given full te&s;timony of all due re&s;pect to congre&s;&s;es; and they could witne&s;s I had &s;o done in appointing our late thank&s;giving; and had not been wanting in endeavours, many ways, to a&s;&s;i&s;t and help the colonies, in their &s;truggles hitherto, for a reconci|liation; and had been as ready to &s;acrifice my intere&s;t and all, for that purpo&s;e, as any of them; but the making &s;uch a &s;o|lemn offering to God as had been propo&s;ed, purely and only out of re&s;pect and obedience to the advice of congre&s;s, would be an open affront to the King of Zion, unprecedented in America, and expre&s;&s;ive of a principle abhorred by all prote&s;tants.</P>
<P>Some de&s;ired, and accordingly I ordered that the proclamati|on &s;hould be read; and &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e upon it was &s;oon very fal&s;ely and injuriou&s;ly repre&s;ented abroad, which made &s;ome an&s;wer thereto in my &s;ermon nece&s;&s;ary; otherwi&s;e al&s;o there had been no occa&s;ion for mentioning this &s;mall circum&s;tance here. But notwith&s;tanding all I could &s;ay, there were &s;ome who yet thought we mu&s;t do it to &s;ave our reputation, and &s;eem'd to think me very unadvi&s;ed, that I would not do it to &s;ave my own; but I let them know that I &s;hould not &s;ave it at &s;o dear a rate. I told them, if they had a de&s;ire to have a lecture upon that day, they might. And though I thought my&s;elf unable to preach it, there were a number of young preach|ers pre&s;ent, who might &s;erve them, and were welcome to my pulpit; they &s;eem'd not &s;atisfied with that, as &s;ufficient to an|&s;wer the de&s;ign they aim'd at. And on Wedne&s;day, a little before night, they &s;ent one, as their committee, to enquire whether I would not con&s;ent, that they &s;hould call in a mini&s;ter to preach a thank&s;giving &s;ermon the next day, in the college hall. I turned my thoughts on what would likely be the &s;hocking con&s;equences, in our pre&s;ent di&s;tempered &s;tate, either of my granting or denying their de&s;ire; and could &s;ee no alter|native,
<PB N="viii" REF="015220_0006_0F9785008E5B6A40">
but to tell the me&s;&s;enger, I would endeavour to preach them a &s;ermon there my&s;elf; and any who &s;hould think it to be their duty, might call and keep it as an anniver&s;ary thank&s;|giving; and thus we might appear uniform therein, as we were all agreed &s;o to ab&s;tain from &s;ervile labour and recreations as not to interrupt one another. And thus the following di&s;|cour&s;e was introduced. But three days had not pa&s;&s;ed, before I heard that reports of this affair had been propagated various ways, nearly as &s;wiftly as a po&s;t could carry them, &amp; as fal&s;e as could be nece&s;&s;ary to their being well calculated to alarm and in|rage the zealous liberty-men, as they affect to be becalled, (but may more properly be termed furious non-con&s;titutional men) and a great variety of pa&s;&s;ions and principles, &s;eemed to operate on this occa&s;ion. Some di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, for fear I had, or &s;hould incur the di&s;plea&s;ure of congre&s;s or committees&mdash;&s;ome convinced, I had truth and God on my &s;ide, and nothing to fear&mdash;&s;ome &s;eemed &s;till to retain the principle, that civil authority, or advice of congre&s;s, was binding in this, and other &s;acred matters&mdash;&s;ome &s;eemed concerned to prove, that the doctrine I had delivered, was con&s;i&s;tent with their having ob&s;erved the &s;olemnity again, agreeable to the de&s;ires of congre&s;s&mdash; others profe&s;&s;ing they had kept the day only on political rea&s;ons&mdash;others zealous to make out that I had been guilty of &s;ome trea&s;on again&s;t the congre&s;s; but unhappy for the lyars, they had not taken care fir&s;t to agree among them&s;elves&mdash;and a doleful &s;moke we have; perhaps, as to the rea&s;ons, nature, quality and tendency of it, not much unlike to that in Rev. <HI>ix.2, 3.</HI></P>
<P>I have been more particular in this relation, as the re|ports gone abroad, are very various. And I am now per|&s;uaded to offer to my neighbours, a &s;ummary of the &s;ermon, in this unpoli&s;hed dre&s;s, not becau&s;e there have not been vo|lumns publi&s;hed to the world already, unan&s;werable upon the &s;ubject, but becau&s;e I apprehend there is pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ity of &s;omething of this nature; and hope there may be &s;ome real advantage thereby to the more ignorant, who have not op|portunity to read what has been better written upon the head,
<PB N="ix" REF="015220_0007_0F97850156B61258">
and who need to be advi&s;ed of the pre&s;ent danger we are in from that quarter.</P>
<P>Should &s;ome crafty enemy to the power of godline&s;s, with a Je&s;uitical head, as well as heart, have influence in an un|guarded congre&s;s, at a time when the work of God &s;hould be revived, and young chri&s;tians, in the height of their religi|ous affections, not endowed with more prudence than to run into &s;uch mi&s;takes and feibles as have heretofore been common to &s;uch, and the enmity of a carnal and lawle&s;s multitude be rai&s;ed again&s;t them, on account of their religion, as has al&s;o been common in &s;uch a ca&s;e, and as Chri&s;t a&s;&s;ures us we are to expect at &s;uch a time; how many occa&s;ions, may we &s;up|po&s;e, will ea&s;ily be found, (and e&s;pecially if lying &s;hould &s;till continue in fa&s;hion) to induce &s;uch a di&s;tempered congre&s;s to interpo&s;e and advi&s;e to many things, which the con&s;ciences of loyal &s;ubjects to the king of Zion would never &s;uffer them to comply with; not, even though lawle&s;s and &s;avage mobbs, and parties of ru&s;&s;ians, &s;hould combine to put the &s;ame in exe|cution, in ever &s;o har&s;h and lawle&s;s a manner; and their do|ings be countenanced by that advice, which by general con&s;ent, &s;hall have, at lea&s;t, the force of a law to ju&s;tify them. God grant we may never &s;ee &s;uch things as the&s;e, but &s;uch there may be, and it is our prudence to be upon our guard. Yea, the pre&s;ent fears and trembling of &s;o many, under apprehen|&s;ions of &s;hocking con&s;equence, I am now expo&s;ed to &s;uffer for my pre&s;ent non-compliance, is, I think, &s;ufficient evidence of great danger from this quarter, and e&s;pecially if we &s;hould be &s;o intimidated as to encourage the evil, by yielding one inch to any authority but Chri&s;t's, in his kingdom. And if the&s;e things be feared at &s;uch a time as this is, what &s;hall we have to fear, when al&s;o from other motives, they &s;hall be in&s;pired, as they are wont to be, by a clear, &s;hining of that light which &s;hall reprove their ungodly deeds!</P>
<P>A good civil con&s;titution, which provided well for the rights of con&s;cience, and in the hands of &s;uch as were otherwi&s;e, and
<PB N="x" REF="015220_0008_0F9785020D567590">
at other times, well qualified for government, has often been perverted at &s;uch a time, through the heat of their temper, to the great injury and oppre&s;&s;ion of the godly, who ought a|bove any to have been defended and &s;ecured by law, in the en|joyment of their natural and ju&s;t rights. And if the power of natural enmity again&s;t the light be &s;o great, as to induce wi&s;e men, and rulers, to oppre&s;&s;ion, notwith&s;tanding all the re&s;traints of a good civil con&s;titution, and the weighty con&s;ider|ations they are furni&s;hed with, what have we to fear, when we have no con&s;titution, nor whol&s;ome laws, nor any to exe|cute any orders at all, but &s;uch as may be dictated by di&s;temper|ed hearts, to &s;erve a cruel de&s;ign? <HI>If the foundations be removed, what &s;hall the righteous do?</HI> Then he that <HI>de|parteth from evil,</HI> and becomes a follower of Chri&s;t, <HI>mak|eth him&s;elf a prey.</HI> And if chri&s;tians, at &s;uch a time, &s;hould think it more &s;afe and prudent for them to yield to the temptation, and withdraw from their allegiance to Chri&s;t, by openly and profe&s;&s;edly &s;ubjecting them&s;elves at all, to any u&s;urped dominion in his kingdom; let them con&s;ider that they do then, and thereby, receive the mark of the bea&s;t in their forehead, and have deba&s;ed them&s;elves to a ba&s;e &s;tate of &s;er|vitude to the Man of Sin; and wholly cut them&s;elves off from all grounds of confidence in God, in an evil day, and &s;tand intitled and expo&s;ed to the heavie&s;t plagues. Rev. <HI>xviii.4.</HI> And however &s;mall their offence may appear to them at pre&s;ent, they will &s;oon find it is not only the wrath of God, in common with other &s;inners, which they have to fear, but the wrath of the Lamb, when he &s;hall appear to a&s;&s;ert and vindicate the rights and honors of his kingly office. See I&s;aiah <HI>ii.10, 11, 12,</HI> and Rev. <HI>vi.15, 16, 17.</HI></P>
<P>If this di&s;cour&s;e may be a mean of bringing any among us, in this our &s;tupid and di&s;tracted &s;tate, to a due con&s;iderati|on, and good under&s;tanding of the nature and importance of that which is here &s;o imperfectly repre&s;ented; and properly awaken their fears, and a cautious watchfulne&s;s again&s;t the

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>JOHN XVIII.36.</BIBL>
<P>JESUS ANSWERED, MY KINGDOM IS NOT OF THIS WORLD: IF MY KINGDOM WERE OF THIS WORLD, THEN WOULD MY SERVANTS FIGHT, THAT I SHOULD NOT BE DE|LIVERED TO THE JEWS: BUT NOW IS MY KING|DOM NOT FROM HENCE.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Jews, moved with envy again&s;t CHRIST, char|ged him with having given out that he was king; and as what was mo&s;t likely to incen&s;e and ingage the Roman &s;tate again&s;t him, they had repre&s;ented that he de&s;igned to &s;et up a kingdom in oppo&s;ition to their's: And to an&s;wer to this charge, he is now brought before Pilate, who examined him whether their charge again&s;t him was true or fal&s;e. JESUS a&s;ks Pilate, how he came by that information? v. 34.
<Q>Say&s;t thou this of thy|&s;elf, or did others tell it thee of me?</Q>
Not that he was unwilling to own it, and all he had &s;aid, for this he does freely afterwards; but to let him under&s;tand,
<PB N="14" REF="015220_0011_0F978506F88AF1F0">
it was ne'er the more to be believed, becau&s;e &s;uch men as his accu&s;ers were, had &s;aid it, and offered to &s;wear to it; for they would as &s;oon lie to &s;erve &s;uch their mali|cious de&s;ign, as &s;peak the truth; and therefore he could have no evidence of the fact which he might &s;afely rely and act upon, nor was any evidence &s;uffici|ent, while the minds of the multitude were &s;o di&s;tem|pered, &s;hort of his hearing and knowing the things him&s;elf. To which Pilate replies, "Am I a Jew?" q. d. I am not intere&s;ted in your affairs, but only as you are complained of, and brought before me by your own nation. "What have you done?" In an|&s;wer to this, JESUS denies their charge, in the light and &s;en&s;e in which they had laid it; or that he had ever &s;aid any thing at all of &s;etting up a kingdom that &s;hould in the lea&s;t interfere with, or any manner of way be prejudicial to their civil &s;tate; but owns he is king of a kingdom of quite another kind and nature, in our text: "My kingdom is not of this world." And that he might effectually remove all grounds of fear or &s;u&s;picion, which they had endeavoured to in|&s;pire from this quarter, he mentions an e&s;&s;ential differ|ence, between his kingdom, and the kingdoms of this world, viz. That his &s;ervants would, on that occa&s;ion, appear with a martial &s;pirit, and with carnal weapons to deliver him from the Power and malice of the Jews.
<Q>If my kingdom were of this world, then would my &s;ervants fight, that I &s;hould not be delivered to the Jews.</Q>
And to &s;atisfy him more fully, he repeats it again, "But now is my kingdom not from hence."</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD>DOCTRINE.</HEAD>
<P>THAT CHRIST's kingdom, that is, his vi&s;ible church in the world, is not of this world, nor has it any like|ne&s;s
<PB N="15" REF="015220_0012_0F978508542EF630">
to, or nece&s;&s;ary connection with, the kingdoms of this world.</P>
<P>AND that which I &s;hall attempt in this di&s;cour&s;e, is,</P>
<P N="1">I. JUST to point out &s;ome e&s;&s;ential differences be|tween CHRIST's kingdom in the world, and a kingdom of this world, or a worldly kingdom.</P>
<P N="2">II. GIVE you &s;ome rea&s;ons, why it is not lawful, but a &s;in again&s;t GOD, and an open affront to JESUS CHRIST to repeat what we did a fortnight ago, by keeping this day as an anniver&s;ary thank&s;giving, purely on and only out of obedience and re&s;pect to civil authority, or ad|vice of the congre&s;s. And,</P>
<P N="1">I. POINT out &s;ome e&s;&s;ential differences between CHRIST's kingdom, &amp; the kingdoms of this world. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. CHRIST's kingdom is his by purcha&s;e, Acts xx.28.
<Q>Take heed&mdash;to feed the church of GOD, which he has purcha&s;ed with his own blood.</Q>&mdash;
His propriety in it is &s;uch as no earthly kings can make any pretention to:&mdash;Worldly kingdoms belong to them only by &s;tipulation with the &s;ubjects, or by a civil con|&s;titution, &s;uch as the light of nature or rea&s;on dictated.</P>
<P N="2">2. CHRIST's kingdom is built, and re&s;ts wholly upon him, as the only ba&s;is and foundation of it.
<Q>Upon this rock (meaning him&s;elf) will I build my church.</Q>
So in this relation to the church, and on account of its dependance upon him, he is often &s;poken of under the metaphor of a foundation &s;tone, a tried &s;tone, a chief, corner &s;tone; and it has been not only once built up|on this foundation, but is upheld, continues and re&s;ts
<PB N="16" REF="015220_0013_0F978508D1690800">
wholly upon it, and can have no being or exi&s;tence a moment without him; and has no other ground of confidence that it &s;hall continue, but the faithful|ne&s;s and all-&s;ufficiency of the founder, who has pro|mi&s;ed,
<Q>that the gates of hell &s;hall not prevail again&s;t it.</Q>
Mat. xvi.18. But nothing like this is the ca&s;e with the kingdoms of this world; their foundation is a civil con&s;titution, and their rights and privileges are &s;ecured and defended by civil and natural means.&mdash;
<Q>If my kingdom were of this world, then would my &s;ervants fight.</Q></P>
<P N="3">3. CHRIST's kingdom has no civil bounds or limits, but wherever he &s;ends the go&s;pel, there it is among any and all nations and languages. Mat. xiii.38. <HI>The field is the world.</HI> The body is but one, however di&s;|tant the members may be from one another, or unlike as to any natural or civil circum&s;tances. But natural or worldly kingdoms are circum&s;cribed, and limited by lines and boundaries.</P>
<P N="4">4. IN a worldly or natural kingdom, the &s;ubjects retain many natural rights and liberties, which are the birth-right which the GOD of nature has granted, and none has right to take them away. But &s;o it is not in CHRIST's kingdom&mdash;there is no &s;uch thing as a natural right in this &s;piritual kingdom. None has right &s;o much as to be, or do, or enjoy the lea&s;t thing in this kingdom, but by grant from CHRIST, and they have it only in and by his right.</P>
<P N="5">5. CHRIST is the only &s;ource of all power and au|thority in this kingdom: He only can give laws and ordinances to it, and he only can appoint officers, and inve&s;t them with authority to execute the &s;ame, Mat.
<PB N="17" REF="015220_0014_0F9785099B3B6B98">
xxviii.18. The&s;e are the gifts which, on his a&s;cen|tion, he gave to men; and they are as much his, and from him as if he had &s;ent angels immediately from heaven commi&s;&s;ioned to perform the &s;ame work. P&s;alm lxviii.18. Eph. iv.8&mdash;11, 112. And his offi|cers, both ordinary and extraordinary, as there was occa&s;ion, he hath &s;et in his mi&s;tical body, for the edifying the &s;ame, as much as GOD has &s;et the mem|bers in the natural body, and appointed them their re&s;|pective offices, for the benefit of that. See 1 Cor. xii.v.18, to the end. And the highe&s;t office any &s;u&s;tain in this kingdom, is only declarative and executive; to declare the will of CHRIST, and obey his orders in exe|cuting the &s;ame. All the potentates and men upon earth, ha'nt power to con&s;titute and authori&s;e the &s;mall|e&s;t judicature, not &s;o much as an arbitration, for the tryal and deci&s;ion of the &s;malle&s;t matter in this kingdom; but an attempt to do it would be a bold affront to the kingly office of CHRIST: and the like in a worldly kingdom, would be accounted and puni&s;hed, as trea&s;on and rebellion again&s;t the prince. And the brotherhood, as well as the officers of the church, would do well to take care that they do not intrude upon the kingly office of CHRIST: as they always do when they take, or claim right to take one &s;tep in eccle&s;ia&s;tical mattes, in, &amp; for which they are not commi&s;&s;ioned and authori&s;ed by CHRIST.</P>
<P N="6">6. THE kingdom of CHRIST is &s;piritual, but other kingdoms are earthly and worldly.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) THE life of it is &s;piritual. The &s;pirit of life in CHRIST JESUS, is the only principle of life in this kingdom. And this was CHRIST's only errand into this world, to give life to it. <HI>I am come, that ye might have life.</HI> John x.10.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) THE light of it is &s;piritual. The book of di|vine
<PB N="18" REF="015220_0015_0F97850A4F110A58">
revelation is the only &s;un which guides and directs it, and all the affairs of it. And the church can no more do without that, than the world can do without the natural &s;un.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) THE laws of it are &s;piritual; they re&s;pect, fir&s;t|ly, and chiefly, the heart, or &s;piritual part, and are de|&s;igned to rule, direct and controul the con&s;ciences of men: But &s;o it is not with the laws of earthly king|doms, which operate no further than the outer man.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) THE officers in this kingdom are all &s;piritual, and as much &s;o in the character of CHRIST's officers, as if they were unbodied &s;pirits, &s;ent immediately from heaven, to perform their re&s;pective offices.</P>
<P N="5">(5.) THE ordinances of this kingdom are all &s;piritual, and not carnal: The&s;e are the means, in the hand of the &s;pirit, of propagating this kingdom, begetting and increa&s;ing the life, and promoting the growth, the health, &s;trength and beauty of it; all which are &s;piri|tual: they are the food and phy&s;ic of CHRIST's family, and they who enjoy a fullne&s;s of them, have a fea&s;t of fat things. I&s;a. xxv.6.</P>
<P N="6">(6.) Rewards and puni&s;hments, and all the weapons for warfare, in this kingdom, are &s;piritual: The pro|mi&s;es which are &s;ealed in the blood of CHRIST, contain all the rewards propo&s;ed; and the cen&s;ures of the church, and the threatnings denounced again&s;t the impenitent tran&s;gre&s;&s;or, are all the puni&s;hment to be inflicted in this kingdom. Mat. xviii.17.</P>
<P>And thus I have hinted, and but ju&s;t mentioned &s;ome e&s;&s;ential differences between CHRIST's kingdom, and the kingdoms of this world. I come now,</P>

humbled before a heart-&s;earching GOD, for great defi|ciency in our offerings to him that day; however, the a&s;&s;embly was full, as u&s;ual, and their behaviour decent, orderly and &s;olemn; and I have no rea&s;on to think that we &s;hould keep it more acceptably to GOD, if we &s;hould repeat it this day, for &s;uch rea&s;ons as have been urged; but on the contrary, it would be unlawful, and an open affront offered to JESUS CHRIST, and that for the&s;e rea|&s;ons.</P>
<P N="1">1. THERE are no other moral rea&s;ons propo&s;ed in the proclamation, inviting or calling us to it, than were duly con&s;idered by us when we kept the day the week before la&s;t, which were the proper &s;ubject matter of an anniver&s;ary thank&s;giving at the end of the year, viz. the ingathering of the fruits and products of the earth; the many public and &s;ignal deliverances and mercies of the la&s;t year; which we are a&s;&s;ured, by GOD him&s;elf, are the proper &s;ubject matter of thank&s;giving at the clo&s;e of the year.</P>
<P N="2">2. THIS &s;olemnity was properly introduced by right|ful authority, and all that authority, below CHRIST, which was e&s;&s;ential to make the offering binding upon us, viz. by our&s;elves, deliberating upon the moral rea|&s;ons for it, and &s;olemnly agreeing therein, and by our unanimous vote, binding our&s;elves to make the offering jointly and religiou&s;ly to GOD. This being done in a matter that is rea&s;onable and lawful, we became bound by our own act to perform unto GOD our vow; and this is all the human authority by which any can be bound in &s;uch matters. There is nothing binding in any proclamations for &s;uch &s;olemnities, excepting what is u&s;ually expre&s;&s;ed in the la&s;t clau&s;e, viz. <HI>And all &s;er|vile labour, and vain recreations, are hereby forbidden on &s;aid day</HI>;&mdash;which only re&s;pects public peace and order,
<PB N="22" REF="015220_0019_0F97850D4E45EE40">
which is properly within the ruler's province; but all the religious matter of it is only coun&s;el, advice and exhortation. And if the moral grounds and rea&s;ons propo&s;ed be ju&s;t and right, people are by them called of GOD thereto, and will be aggravatedly guilty if they neglect it, while the civil ruler is going before, and granting them his aid and a&s;&s;i&s;tance therein.</P>
<P N="3">3. IN our appointment and ob&s;ervance of that &s;o|lemnity, we had proper re&s;pect to, and were governed and directed therein (as I under&s;tand the people of the&s;e colonies have profe&s;&s;ed to be) by the will of GOD inti|mated to us in his word, and particularly by the ancient in&s;titution and ordinance of GOD to his people I&s;rael; wherein they were directed by &s;uch a &s;olemnity, at the end of the year, publicly and unitedly to acknowledge the bounties of divine providence, e&s;pecially in the ble&s;|&s;ings of his goodne&s;s to them in the produce of the earth the year pa&s;t. And by this and other ordinances; as the fir&s;t &s;heaf, the fir&s;t of their dough, &amp;c. he would have them know, and bear in mind, that they lived up|on his goodne&s;s &s;till, and were as much indebted to him for daily &s;upplies, as when they were day by day, fed with manna from heaven. See Exod. xxiii.16. <HI>Thou &s;halt ob&s;erve the fea&s;t of ingathering, which is in the end of the year, when thou ha&s;t gathered in thy labours out of the field.</HI> So chap. xxxiv.22, &amp;c. The moral rea&s;ons of which, &s;o far as they are the &s;ame, are equally binding upon us as they were upon them. But ob&s;erve, neither in the rea&s;on of the thing, nor in the in&s;titution it&s;elf, is there the lea&s;t intimation that it was ever to be repeated in the &s;ame year: &s;o that, &s;o far as we acknowledge the obligation of that example and in&s;titution, or the moral rea&s;ons of it, our repetition of it, would be properly &s;u|per&s;tition, that is, <HI>&s;uper &s;tatutum,</HI> above the &s;tatute, or above what is appointed.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="015220_0020_0F97850EE533DD60">AND moreover, by this &s;econd act, or a repetition of the &s;ame, we &s;hould implicitly declare the fir&s;t to be null and void, which to do in this ca&s;e, would be pro|fanene&s;s, &s;olemn mockery, and trifling with the great JEHOVAH: for &s;o far as we are directed, governed, or bound by that ordinance of GOD to I&s;rael, or the moral rea&s;on of it, there is no more propriety in our repeating it now, than in repeating the ordinance of bapti&s;m to the &s;ame &s;ubject, or the ordination of men to the &s;acred mini&s;try. But,</P>
<P N="4">4. THE repeating this &s;olemnity as an offering to GOD, purely out of re&s;pect to the authority of man, or through fear of incuring the di&s;plea&s;ure of man if we neglect it, which is all the rea&s;on that is urged, or can be a&s;&s;igned for our &s;o doing, is an open affront to CHRIST, and a bold inva&s;ion of his prerogative, as king in his kingdom, and &s;uch re&s;pect to foreign power, as no earthly prince would bear from a &s;ubject of his kingdom. We are a|bundantly a&s;&s;ured, that CHRIST's kingly office is very dear, and I may &s;ay, peculiarly dear to him; he has given us this evidence that it is &s;o, above any other truth, viz. that he him&s;elf died a martyr (i. e. a witne&s;s) for this, and no other truth. This he him&s;elf declares, upon his tryal before Pilate, when, in an&s;wer to Pilate's que&s;tion upon the &s;ubject, (John xviii.37) he &s;ays, <HI>I am a king</HI>; and adds, <HI>For this end was I born, and for this cau&s;e came I into the world, that I &s;hould bear witne&s;s unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth, heareth my voice,</HI> i. e. that truth which he had then profe&s;&s;ed, and was then bearing witne&s;s to. And this is what the a|po&s;tle refers to, 1 Tim. vi.13. <HI>Who before Pontius Pi|late witne&s;&s;ed a good confe&s;&s;ion.</HI> His good confe&s;&s;ion was that he was King, and for that confe&s;&s;ion he &s;uffered what he did.&mdash;This was the great crime which the Jews,
<PB N="24" REF="015220_0021_0F97850FD334A040">
his enemies, charged again&s;t him; for this he was in|dicted, arraigned, tried and condemned before Ponti|us Pilate; and for this confe&s;&s;ion he was delivered into the hands of mercile&s;s per&s;ecutors, who mocked and de|rided him in this character, by putting a purple robe, and a crown of thorns upon him, and a reed, in&s;tead of a &s;ceptre, in his hand, the mock habit of a king; and for this he &s;uffered mo&s;t extreme agony, and yield|ed up the gho&s;t upon the cro&s;s; and this was his in|&s;cription on his cro&s;s, Luke xxiii.38. <HI>And a &s;uper&s;crip|tion was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS: And every one that is of the truth, heareth my voice</HI>; that is, every one that cordially receives this truth which I bear witne&s;s to, will hear my voice as his king, i. e. he will fol|low and obey me. In this character GOD di&s;tingui&s;hing|ly honoured and dignified him, when he rai&s;ed him from the dead, P&s;alm ii.6. <HI>Yet have I &s;et my king upon my holy hill of Zion</HI>; which the apo&s;tle tells us, was fulfilled when GOD rai&s;ed him from the dead. Acts xiii.33. and in this character he is &s;till di&s;tingui&s;hingly honour|ed by the Father, Eph. i.22. <HI>And hath put all things un|der his feet, and gave him to be head over all things to the church.</HI> And in this character he had the highe&s;t ho|nors of the heavenly ho&s;t at his a&s;cen&s;ion; and will have them again at his &s;econd coming. And in this cha|racter, he will be eternally honored by &s;aints and angels, while they join and &s;ing, <HI>Worthy is the Lamb that was &s;lain, to receive power, and riches, and wi&s;dom, and &s;trength, and honor, and glory and ble&s;&s;ing.</HI> Rev. ix.12. And, &s;ure|ly, if CHRIST be &s;uch a king, and his kingly office has co&s;t him &s;o dear, it is not a &s;mall offence for mortals, boldly to intrude upon it, or yield to any authority be|&s;ides, or as &s;uperior to his in his kingdom. But let them be wi&s;e, <HI>and ki&s;s the Son, and &s;erve him with fear, and keep his law as the apple of their eye, le&s;t he be angry, and they peri&s;h from the way.</HI></P>
<P N="5"><PB N="25" REF="015220_0022_0F9785104D4A1598">5. THIS principle on which it is propo&s;ed that we &s;hould keep this day as a thank&s;giving to GOD, is the very e&s;&s;ence of popery; the very cardinal principle, on which a door opens &s;ufficiently wide enough to let us directly into all the &s;uper&s;tition and idolatry of that church; and there never was any other door to it. See what are the leading characters of the Man of Sin, 2 The&s;&s;. ii.4. <HI>Who oppo&s;eth, and exalteth him&s;elf above all that is called God, or that is wor&s;hipped, &s;o that he as God, &s;itteth in the temple of God, &s;hewing him&s;elf that he is God</HI>; that is, he claims power and authority in matters of religion, and his authority he inforces, and will have &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion yielded to it, rather than to GOD's, in the af|fairs of CHRIST's kingdom. And when men are once &s;o void of re&s;pect to the kingly office of CHRIST, as to yield this point, through any temptation, they are then at the beck of the Man of Sin, and have &s;et their face to wander after the bea&s;t; and have received his mark in their forehead: that is, they profe&s;s &s;ubjection, and openly yield obedience to human power in &s;piritual matters. The <HI>forehead</HI> is the part mo&s;t vi&s;ible, and therefore the place mo&s;t &s;uitable for a public mark of di&s;tinction. So their profe&s;&s;ion of re&s;pect, and public acts of obedience to human authority, in CHRIST's king|dom, is the great moral mark of di&s;tinction, by which they may certainly be known; and this mark &s;hould we now wear, if we had this day complied with the pro|po&s;al of &s;uch a &s;olemn offering to GOD, and that only upon &s;uch grounds and rea&s;ons as have been urged.</P>
<P N="6">6. THIS is the very principle of per&s;ecution for CHRIST's &s;ake, and the great and only door at which it has come into the church, under chri&s;tian princes, from time to time. And what rivers of blood has this very principle produced! There is no cla&s;hing of rights,
<PB N="26" REF="015220_0023_0F9785130A439428">
laws, liberties or intere&s;ts of the&s;e kingdoms, one with another; but when each keeps within its own &s;phere, there is perfect peace, and they mutually and recipro|cally &s;erve and promote each other. But when civil power encroaches an inch upon CHRIST's prerogative, a &s;anctified and enlightened con&s;cience can never be compelled to a compliance; and if they are of the truth, and hear CHRIST's voice, no in&s;truments of cruelty will avail any thing in this attempt. And whether &s;uch at|tempts be made, by reproach, or threats, or &s;tripes, or faggots, or any other way of &s;uffering, to bring them an inch towards a compliance with &s;uch authority, it is properly per&s;ecution for CHRIST's &s;ake.</P>
<P N="7">7. ANY, even the lea&s;t yielding in this ca&s;e, is danger|ous, and a direct and leading &s;tep to a flood of per&s;e|cution, however remote it may &s;eem at pre&s;ent. The evil don't alter its nature, becau&s;e thou&s;ands never con|&s;ider what it is, but as &s;ecurely run into it, as into any other acts, and imagine they have done no harm; it is yet an affront offered to CHRIST, and renouncing alle|giance to him; and that which they would rather part with their lives, and all, as others have done, than to be guilty of it, if their con&s;ciences were only enlighten|ed and &s;anctified. So it is not at all le&s;s dangerous, or the more remote from us, becau&s;e thou&s;ands make light of it, and think it to be but a little thing, and the danger too remote to demand their care or thoughts about it. Many are &s;o &s;tupid as to think after this &s;ort of the height of impiety, and all manner of immoralities; and think it &s;trange that you run not with them into the &s;ame exce&s;&s;es; and will reproach you for your tenderne&s;s of con&s;cience. This has commonly been the religious &s;tate of things, and this always the way in which the my&s;tery of iniquity has made its way into the

church of GOD. They may &s;ay,
<Q>what &s;o great harm in keeping an anniver&s;ary, and performing religious rites in memory of &s;uch and &s;uch eminent &s;aints who&s;e names ought to be kept in everla&s;ting remem|brance? What &s;o great a thing is the making a cro&s;s with your finger upon your forehead, or brea&s;t, a few times in divine wor&s;hip, or changing a garment, and a thou&s;and other things, &s;mall and indifferent in them&s;elves? Your non-compliance with them, as they are injoin'd by authority, and approv'd and practi&s;ed by the multitude, will expo&s;e you to many and great evils; the rulers will take you in hand, and will countenance parties of ruffians in a very cour&s;e manner of dealing with you, &amp;c. &amp;c.</Q>
But the&s;e things, little as they are in them&s;elves, are &s;o great when injoin'd by human authority, and to be performed in religious wor&s;hip, out of re&s;pect and obe|dience to man, that &s;uch by thou&s;ands as were of <HI>the truth,</HI> and had <HI>heard Chri&s;t's voice,</HI> have cho&s;e rather to meet death, in its greate&s;t outward horrors, than com|ply with the lea&s;t of them, and that becau&s;e it would be an open affront to CHRIST's kingly office, an act of high trea&s;on and rebellion again&s;t the King of Zion. And as it is in other vices, our compliance in one in|&s;tance, will make way for another. It will make the practice familiar, put a reputation upon it, and weaken the hands of &s;uch as are of the truth, and will be con|&s;train'd to te&s;tify again&s;t it.</P>
<P>IF &s;uch power &s;hould be acknowledged, in matters of religious wor&s;hip, or any &s;piritual &s;acrifices and of|ferings to GOD, what a &s;hocking door would be open, for precepts, or authoritative advice, in a thou&s;and things which would not be complied with; and who knows what trying &s;cenes would en&s;ue? I tremble at

the con&s;equences, and e&s;pecially in a part of the country where experienced chri&s;tians are &s;o rare, and &s;o ob&s;cure, and the religion in fa&s;hion &s;o much in the form only, without the power.</P>
<P N="8">8. SUCH a compliance as has been propo&s;ed, would be a very di&s;graceful, and it may be a very pernicious precedent, to tho&s;e that &s;hall come after us; and &s;uch a precedent as I am re&s;olved, by the grace of GOD, not to leave, to be improved in any degree for the counte|nance and encouragement of &s;piritual tyranny and per|&s;ecution in future times. GOD grant me courage and fortitude to meet death a thou&s;and times, in any form, rather than yield one inch towards &s;uch a compliance, or do that whereby my dear pupils, the pre&s;ent mem|bers of this &s;eminary, or any in a future &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, &s;hould be led to think, that the founder of it did not e&s;teem &s;uch a treatment of the kingly office of the great REDEEMER, to be a crime of the blacke&s;t die; and &s;uch a &s;olemn offering profe&s;&s;edly to GOD, only upon &s;uch grounds and rea&s;ons, and for &s;uch a purpo&s;e, as have been (or under our circum&s;tances can be) urged, to be the height of profane&s;s and impiety, in his eyes who &s;earches all hearts, and cannot be deceived by any di&s;|gui&s;es.</P>

LOOK thoroughly into this &s;ubject, and form your judgment and principles therein by the word of truth, and not by the floating, undige&s;ted opinions of an ig|norant, giddy, &s;tupid, unprincipled multitude, who would carry all before them by their &s;coffs, deri&s;ion, and furious clamours again&s;t you; and are the proper in|&s;truments, to erect the pile for your execution, if they had any to ju&s;tify and vindicate them in &s;o doing. If you look well into this matter, you will find this truth to be of the &s;ame nature and importance, and as much to ju&s;tify your holding fa&s;t the principle, as there ever

was when clouds of witne&s;&s;es &s;eal'd the truth of it with their blood.</P>
<P N="2">2. SEE that you have true principles of loyalty to CHRIST in your hearts; &s;uch as real knowledge of, and acquaintance with him&mdash;&s;upreme love to him&mdash;a live|ly faith and confidence in him&mdash;full contentment with his great and precious promi&s;es, as your only portion and heritage forever&mdash;and that hope which looks to them, and is an anchor to the &s;oul, &s;ure and &s;teadfa&s;t &mdash;with a pure love, and fervent charity one towards another&mdash;and a &s;piritual mind that the word of GOD may dwell in you richly. And this it is to be <HI>of the truth,</HI> as CHRIST &s;ays in the afore cited text, and &s;o <HI>you will hear his voice, and follow him.</HI></P>
<P>IF we be rooted and grounded in the&s;e, and other graces of the &s;pirit, we &s;hall endure the trial, and do honour to our divine ma&s;ter, in a day of temptation; but otherwi&s;e, our courage will fail like Peter's, who, though fir&s;t and highe&s;t in profe&s;&s;ion of attachment to his ma&s;ter, was fir&s;t and ba&s;e&s;t in a cowardly denial of him, when the hour of trial came. And without this, we &s;hall all be like chaff, expo&s;ed to be turned, and blown about by every wind.</P>
<P N="3">3. BE not di&s;mayed at the fir&s;t appearance of &s;uffer|ing for CHRIST. Temptations of this kind, are com|monly mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful at their fir&s;t attack. The cro&s;s is always the mo&s;t formidable at a di&s;tance&mdash;Peter found it to be &s;o; when it is once taken up, it is ea&s;y and light. Matt. xi.30. The apo&s;tle therefore bids us ab&s;tain from all appearance of evil. 1 The&s;&s;. v.22. And to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, in a ca&s;e &s;imilar to our's, &s;ays, <HI>Touch not, ta&s;te not, handle not.</HI> Col. ii.21. And agree|able

to this was the advi&s;e of a godly divine, &s;uffering in this very cau&s;e, who, in his parting charge to his flock &s;ays, "Touch not a bracelet of the &s;carlet whore." It is much ea&s;ier to keep our ground, than to recover it when we have given way to temptation ever &s;o little.</P>
<P N="4">4. CONSIDER well how many and how great the mo|tives are, which CHRIST has &s;et before you, to excite and enable you to per&s;evere in a loyal adhearance to him at all hazards. How noble the cau&s;e! How &s;uf|ficient the aid provided for you therein! How honour|able the combat, under &s;uch a Captain and Leader! How &s;ure the victory! How peaceful your end! And how rich and glorious your eternal reward!</P>
