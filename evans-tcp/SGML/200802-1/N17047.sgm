The Honorable Judge MORRIS on the Bench.</HEAD>
<P>ON Monday the 26th of January, 1789, the &s;aid <HI>Morhou&s;e</HI> was called down and arraigned before the Court, and there charged by indictment with forging a bond in the name of <HI>Richard Mulherrain,</HI> and purporting to be given by the &s;aid <HI>Mulherrain</HI> to <HI>Zebulon Ro&s;s,</HI> jun. on the &s;econd of December and year 1779, witne&s;&s;ed by <HI>I&s;rael Young</HI> and <HI>Jacob Ott;</HI> conditioned for the payment of One Thou&s;and Pounds New York currency. To which indictments he plead <HI>not guilty,</HI> and put him&s;elf upon the country for trial, and informed the Court he &s;hould be ready to an&s;wer to his Indictments on Wedne&s;day the 28th of January; which day being agreed to, he was re committed to Pri&s;on. On Tue&s;day the 27th January, the &s;aid <HI>Morhou&s;e</HI> was again called down, and charged by two indictments: The one with having been con|cerned in the forgery of the afore&s;aid bond, and the other for uttering the bond knowing it to be forged. To both which indictments he plead <HI>not guilty;</HI> and after putting him&s;elf upon his country for trial, he prayed the Honorable Court to inform him upon which indictment he &s;hould fir&s;t be tried, &s;o that he may prepare him&s;elf to an&s;wer it, as he made u&s;e of no Coun&s;el; but the Court refu&s;ed to inform him. He was then ordered back to pri&s;on, and the next day he was brought down again, al&s;o the &s;aid <HI>I&s;rael Young,</HI> one of the &s;ub&s;cribing witne&s;&s;es afore&s;aid to the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> bond, al&s;o <HI>Samuel Walters,</HI> who were both arrainged and charged by indictments with being concerned <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the forgery of the afore&s;aid bond.

After the Jury were &s;worn, they then proceeded to examine the wit|ne&s;&s;es for the People. The fir&s;t of which was <HI>Peter R.

<P><HI>Jacob Ott,</HI> as one of the &s;ub&s;cribing witne&s;&s;es before|mentioned, was then called and brought forward to be &s;worn; but the &s;aid <HI>Morhou&s;e</HI> objected again&s;t him as being an evidence, as he had killed a man in <HI>Nova Scolia,</HI> for which he was convicted and burnt in the hand, upon which he was turned a&s;ide, and <HI>Richard Mulherrain</HI> was called and &s;worn, and declar|ed <Q>That he never gave the bond now in que&s;tion, and that he had never any dealings with <HI>Zebulon Ro&s;s,</HI> jun. except to the amount of twenty-&s;even pounds which he had &s;upplied his family with, and for which the &s;aid <HI>Ro&s;s</HI> owed him; and that &s;ome time in the month of <HI>September,</HI> the afore&s;aid <HI>Jacob Ott</HI> came to him and informed him that there were &s;ome men in gaol who were about forging a bond again&s;t him to a large amount, and wanted to engage him the &s;aid <HI>Ott,</HI> to be a witne&s;s to the &s;aid bond, but that he would not do it without letting him know of it; and further the &s;aid <HI>Mulherrain</HI> declared that he did not at fir&s;t credit the &s;aid <HI>Ott;</HI> but after &s;everal informations of the &s;ame kind, he was induced to believe him, and for fear that the bond might be withdrawn from Mr. <HI>R.

I told him I would try. Accordingly the next day happen|ing to get the liberty of the Hall, I told Mr. <HI>Wil&s;on,</HI> if he would give his note to Mr. <HI>Ott,</HI> for Fifty Pounds that he would get me out, and as &s;oon as I was out I would &s;ettle the matter with him, which he by my per&s;ua&s;ion con&s;ented to do, and Mr. <HI>Ott,</HI> coming there that day, we then, Mr. <HI>Wil&s;on,</HI> Mr. <HI>Ott,</HI> and my&s;elf, went up &s;tairs together, and Mr. <HI>Wil&s;on</HI> gave Mr. <HI>Ott</HI> a note for Fifty Pounds, payable in a few days, but how many I do not remember; Mr. <HI>Ott</HI> the next day brought me a rope, a chi&s;el and three gimblets, but never brought any keys. We broke the room with the tools, and my&s;elf and five more went out, Mr. <HI>Wil&s;on</HI> was then confined in the room, with us but would not go out.

but being young and unexperienced in the world, I did not take that precaution and care as might be expected from one further advanced in years, and rip|ened by experience: being naturally of an ea&s;y and benevolent temper, I was induced by &s;olicitations to give large credits, and when the day of payment came, by their pleading up &s;carcity of money and their ina|bility to pay, my ea&s;y nature would never permit me to di&s;tre&s;s them or their families, and by that means payments were put off from time to time, and many of them remain unpaid to this day In le&s;s than a year after I commenced bu&s;ine&s;s, by a calculation of my affairs, I imagined I had made as much money as I &s;hould ever want, and at that time having a great inclination to travel I equipped my&s;elf with a con&s;i|derable degree of &s;plendor, and &s;et out to explore the &s;outhern &s;tates, having fir&s;t put my affairs which I was obliged to leave behind into the hands of a friend, with expre&s;s orders for him to collect as much money as would pay my debts and to obtain as &s;peedy as po&s;|&s;ible a di&s;charge from all my creditors.

my&s;elf reduced in a labyrinth of perplexities and trou|bles; for although I had much more owing me than I owed, yet the &s;carcity of money and the &s;ituation of many of my debtors, I &s;oon &s;aw would make it very difficult to collect money enough to pay my debts; and being at the &s;ame time jealous that were my cre|ditors acquainted with my return, they would immedi|ately fall upon me unprepared for their money, and &s;o ca&s;t me into pri&s;on, which you are all &s;en&s;ible, Gen|tlemen, is a very poor place for a man to &s;ettle his bu&s;ine&s;s in. This idea, Gentlemen, brought me to a re&s;olution of embracing my free moments, to bring my creditors to a favorable compo&s;ition. But not knowing who to tru&s;t, I thought no one would be &s;o proper to tran&s;act the bu&s;ine&s;s as my&s;elf; and well knowing that from my long ab&s;ence and the great al|teration made in my per&s;on, my mo&s;t intimate friends would not know me by &s;ight. I therefore called my name <HI>John M. Wil&s;on,</HI> and as it were under this invi|&s;ible di&s;gui&s;e, I could with ea&s;e and plea&s;ure &s;ettle the bu&s;ine&s;s for <HI>Abraham Morhou&s;e,</HI> and my acquaintance with all the circum&s;tances, and di&s;gui&s;ed as a friend, would enable me to do ju&s;tice on all &s;ides, both to my&s;elf and my creditors, and I make no doubt, Gen|tlemen, but you will con&s;ider the &s;tratagem as a very innocent one, as you plainly di&s;cover that it was laid to injure no man, but to contribute to the general good. With the&s;e intentions, Gentlemen, I came to this ci|ty and put up at a genteel hou&s;e, avoided company or connexion, and confined my&s;elf wholly to the pro|&s;ecution of my favorite plan, and had already vi&s;ited &s;everal of my creditors, and under my di&s;gui&s;e con|ver&s;ed with them freely upon affairs between them and <HI>Abraham Morhou&s;e,</HI> without their having the lea&s;t mi&s;|tru&s;t that they were then conver&s;ing with him, and &s;hould have brought on a compromi&s;e in a few days that would have proved highly beneficial to both par|ties. But fortune, not yet tired of per&s;ecuting an innocent victim, thought proper to cut of my favorite hopes, and plunged me again into a &s;ea of troubles,

for this purpo&s;e they &s;eemed to infu&s;e &s;u&s;picion into the heads of &s;ome con&s;tables who were in &s;earch of per&s;ons they fir&s;t &s;u&s;pected of counterfeiting money, that I was one likewi&s;e, that it would be proper for them to take up, they in con&s;equence took me before Alderman <HI>Wool,</HI> who &s;eemed to have catched the di&s;|order, and that &s;o &s;trongly, that he immediately with|out ceremony, &s;ent me to gaol, but for what I never could learn from that time until this. I indeed heard a flying report that I was committed for pa&s;&s;ing coun|terfeit money, but this I knew to be a mi&s;take, as I had not pa&s;&s;ed a paper bill for eight months before, but being in gaol I was to make the be&s;t of it, and being in want of money, I wrote to Capt. <HI>Ro&s;s</HI> who owed me a con&s;iderable &s;um, that he wrote me back, which my letters of attorney here plainly &s;hew, that he had no money, but &s;ent me a bond in judgment again&s;t <HI>Richard Mulherrain</HI> for &pound;.1000 and de&s;ired me to collect &s;aid bond, pay my&s;elf out of the money, and return him the overplus. This bond when I received it I gave it to <HI>Peter R Living&s;ton</HI> to collect. Now, Gentlemen, plea&s;e to mark how candidly I tran&s;acted the bu&s;ine&s;s, for although I was then known by no other name but <HI>Wil&s;on</HI> but the moment that I found my&s;elf obliged to do bu&s;ine&s;s, I de&s;pi&s;ed doing it un|der a borrowed name, but immediately di&s;clo&s;ed my true name, as this receipt will demon&s;trate where he acknowledges to have received of <HI>Abraham Morhou&s;e</HI> the above mentioned bond to put in &s;uit, which plainly &s;hews that all I did and meant was hone&s;t and &s;quare, and that I never changed my name to defraud any man.

<P>"You here behold, Gentlemen, a bond &s;igned by <HI>Richard Mulherrain,</HI> witne&s;&s;ed by <HI>I&s;rael Young</HI> and <HI>Jacob Ott.</HI> Two witne&s;&s;es to an obligation of this na|ture is as much as the law requires, and therefore this bond is not deficient in that point, but you may &s;ay the witne&s;&s;es do not agree; for here is <HI>Ott,</HI> one of the witne&s;&s;es declares that the bond is forged, and that he was to receive Fifty Pounds to become a witne&s;s, and has here the note for the money to produce, and like|wi&s;e Mr. <HI>Mulherrain</HI> &s;wears he never gave &s;uch a bond. It is true. Gentlemen, they have &s;worn &s;o, and by that means the grand jury was induced to indict Mr. <HI>Young,</HI> which has deprived me of the privilege of his evidence, but with what ju&s;tice I will leave it to you to judge. You &s;ee, Gentlemen, Mr. <HI>Mulherrain</HI> is called upon in this ca&s;e to be an evidence, in which he has two alternatives, by taking the one he ab&s;olutely &s;wears about Sixteen Hundred Pounds out of his poc|ket, and by taking the other, &s;wears as much in, and I think, Gentlemen you will readily judge which his choice is: the Honorable Court &s;ays, that the law makes him a good witne&s;s, but pray Gentlemen, does any law human or divine, (except in a Court of Con|cience) oblige a man to bear te&s;timony again&s;t him|&s;elf?
<PB N="15" REF="021976_0014_0FB64A82AA022E50">
I believe not, if &s;o, then why &s;hould a man be permitted to be an evidence in his own favor, it ap|pears to be unconnected with rea&s;on and rea&s;on is held as the foundation of law. I acknowledge, Gentlemen, that in &s;ome ca&s;es it corroborates with rea&s;on and ju&s;|tice, that a man &s;hould be an evidence on his own be|half, for in&s;tance, where a man has property &s;tolen from him, and no other evidence but his own can be procured to prove the property his, in &s;uch and the like ca&s;es, it is rea&s;onable that his evidence &s;hould be ad|mitted on his own behalf, but then he &s;hould be exa|mined with the utmo&s;t caution, and no more weight &s;hould be laid upon his te&s;timony than could be ju&s;tifi|ed by circum&s;tances, the &s;ituation of the ca&s;e con&s;ider|ed. It is true, <HI>Mulherrain</HI> produces a letter as a cir|cum&s;tance to prove the truth of his evidence, but as there is no proof its ever being wrote by <HI>Ro&s;s,</HI> I don't &s;ee, Gentlemen, that you can take any notice of it, e&s;pecially as there are &s;everal weighty circum&s;tances again&s;t him, which greatly overbalances the introduc|tion of this pretended letter and which only &s;erves to make <HI>Mulherrain</HI>'s fraud appear more con&s;picuous, as will &s;hortly be explained. Secondly, Gentlemen here is <HI>Ott</HI> &s;wears that I engaged him to be a witne&s;s to this bond &s;ome time in the fore part of Septemper la&s;t, and gave him a note for Fifty Pounds to do it, do you believe this, Gentlemen, to be a fact? If you do, you mu&s;t di&s;credit &s;everal very &s;ub&s;tantial witne&s;&s;es, who are not only witne&s;&s;es of good reputation, but witne&s;&s;es that every circum&s;tance &s;erves to prove the validity of their te&s;timonies; therefore you cannot nor will not believe any thing that <HI>Ott</HI> informs you. Now, admitting <HI>Ott</HI>'s evidence to be fal&s;e, which is mo&s;t po|&s;itively the ca&s;e, we &s;hall naturally draw this plain and equitable inference, that is, <HI>Mulherrain</HI> being inform|ed (as ea&s;ily he might) that <HI>Ro&s;s</HI> had &s;ent me the bond to collect, and knowing it to be for a large &s;um of money, and finding in him&s;elf an inability or di&s;in|clination to pay it, he immediately falls upon a &s;cheme to quit him&s;elf of the demand, and as the mo&s;t expe|ditious
<PB N="16" REF="021976_0015_0FB64A85983065E8">
way he applies to <HI>Ott,</HI> whom we find as long ago as when the bond was given, to be his favorite witne&s;s, as he then refu&s;ed having any other but him to be a &s;econd witne&s;s to the bond and from this we mu&s;t na|turally &s;uppo&s;e, that <HI>Mulherrain</HI> knew his man, and and at that moment intended to cheat <HI>Ro&s;s</HI> out of his property and laid his plans accordingly: in con&s;e|quence of which determination he goes to <HI>Ott</HI> as &s;oon as he found the bond coming again&s;t him, and agrees to give him a certain &s;um of money to &s;wear that the bond was a forgery this Gentlemen, you mu&s;t po|&s;itively believe as you find by Mr. <HI>Ketcham</HI>'s te&s;timony, that <HI>Ott</HI> declared that he was only waiting for Mr. <HI>Mulherrain</HI> to come home and he could get money enough, that he got money of <HI>Mulherrain</HI> whenever he wanted it, and to the amount of Fifty or Sixty Pounds, which money. Gentlemen, <HI>Mulherrain</HI> could never give <HI>Ott</HI> for any other thing, but for him to &s;wear the bond was not a forgery, as we find in both of their te&s;timonies; they deny ever having any dealings or connexions together In this manner he &s;ecured <HI>Ott,</HI> and engaged him to declare the bond a forgery; but being a&s;&s;ured that <HI>Ott</HI>'s evidence would be no more than Mr. <HI>Young</HI>'s, and con&s;cious that Mr. <HI>Young</HI>'s in|tegrity could not be corrupted by a golden fee, he formed another project, the execution of which he &s;uppo&s;ed, and that with &s;ome rea&s;on, would be a &s;trong circum&s;tance in his favor, and &s;erve to prejudice the minds of the people on his behalf, he therefore orders <HI>Ott</HI> who had become his emi&s;&s;ary to go to the pri&s;on, and under the pretence of a&s;&s;i&s;ting the pri&s;on|ers to break gaol, to procure &s;ome kind of property or obligation from me, with which he propo&s;ed work|ing miracles. <HI>Ott,</HI> according to his orders, came up, but finding I had no inclination to quit my con&s;ine|ment in that manner, &s;ecretly applies to &s;ome of the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, and with fair promi&s;es and hopes of a &s;pee|dy enjoyment of precious and much coveted liberty, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> them in his plan, but then the difficulty was &s;tarted how they &s;hould pay him, for he had taken

care to a&s;k &s;uch a price as he was &s;ure they could not immediately comply with without a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he there|fore immediately offers to take my note, and help them to what they &s;o eagerly de&s;ired. Mr. <HI>To|bias</HI> with whom I was &s;ome acquainted, thought the offer advantageous, and readily agreed to &s;olicit me to become his &s;pon&s;or for the Fifty Pounds, he &s;ucceeded; I gave my note as you &s;ee fully demon|&s;trated by Mr. <HI>Tobias</HI>'s te&s;timony, as &s;oon as he had got the note, with eager tran&s;port he ha&s;tens to <HI>Mul|herrain,</HI> informs him of his progre&s;s, who exults with him at the &s;ucce&s;s of their &s;tratagem. Being now &s;e|cure in their own minds, no &s;ooner did <HI>Mulherrain</HI> find the bond in <HI>Peter R. Living&s;ton,</HI> the attorney's hands, but he applies to him, and with the benign influence of his pur&s;e, engages him to go and deliver the bond to the Honorable Judge <HI>Morris,</HI> who by appearances was induced to believe the bond was a forgery, and that I was at the bottom of it, and immediately orders me to be treated accordingly, which orders I have very &s;everely experienced. Gentlemen, as to what the State's. Attorney has offered to your con&s;ideration concerning the bonds mentioning State of New-York, which he &s;ays he thinks the cu&s;tom was at that time to mention province of New-York, and urges the dif|ference as a proof that the bond is forged, but that nice ob&s;ervation of his can have no weight with you Gentlemen, when you con&s;ider, that New-York was then an independent State, and the Briti&s;h being po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of this &s;mall corner could not affect its title, be|&s;ide Mr. <HI>Ro&s;s</HI> was from the country where it was uni|ver&s;ally called a State, and he without doubt, cho&s;e to make u&s;e of a term which was not only more legal than any other but one that he had been familiarly conver&s;ant with. The State's Attorney likewi&s;e in|forms you, Gentlemen, that there is a letter diffe|rence between <HI>Mulherrain</HI>'s name as &s;pelt in &s;igning the bond, and the manner he now writes it; this al&s;o he produces as the bond's being forged: but you will immediately perceive, Gentlemen, that he could not
<PB N="18" REF="021976_0017_0FB64A8ACA227798">
produce a &s;tronger circum&s;tance of the bond's being a good one; for you <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, Gentlemen, he produces no proof that <HI>Mulherrain</HI> did not write his name in 1777, as it is here &s;igned to the bond, but produces a paper which <HI>Mulherrain</HI> has wrote on purpo&s;e, and no other proof of its being his common method of writing, but his own oath, which how far ought to be credited. I &s;hall leave it to you to judge; but &s;uppo&s;ing it to be really the ca&s;e, that <HI>Mulherrain</HI>'s name to the bond is mis&s;pelt, you mu&s;t and will &s;uppo&s;e, Gentlemen, that <HI>Mulherrain</HI> made the mi&s;take him&s;elf, and that wilful|ly; for you can't &s;urely imagine, that any man would be &s;o great an idiot, as to undertake to counterfeit another man's name (and e&s;pecially in a matter of this con&s;equence) unle&s;s he had the man's name and hand writing, &s;o intended to be forged pre&s;ent, and to view with great care and circum&s;pection, &s;o that both of the&s;e circum&s;tances are weighty additional proofs to what has already been clearly demon&s;trated; which is this, that <HI>Mulherrain,</HI> at the time he gave this obli|gation, laid his plans to defraud <HI>Ro&s;s</HI> of his property, and evade the payment of the bond, and has proceed|ed accordingly. For Gentlemen, I make no doubt but you are fully convinced, that <HI>Ott</HI> &s;wore fal&s;e, and that <HI>Mulherrain</HI> hired him to do &s;o, and if his ambiti|on would carry him &s;o far as to &s;ubborn a witne&s;s to deprive a man of his ju&s;t due, and take the lives of three innocent men, and plunge them into eternity, for no other rea&s;on but that they want ob&s;tacles to his avarice. To crown the &s;cene of baneful fraud, he would &s;wallow an oath him&s;elf, e&s;pecially as it was likely to contribute &s;o largely to his own intere&s;t. Gentlemen, you will be obliging enough to con&s;i|der every circum&s;tance &s;eriou&s;ly. In me you behold a man oppre&s;&s;ed with the heavy hand of tyranny, and loaded with affliction, more than &s;ix long months have pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince I was confined and clo&s;e &s;hut up from all conver&s;ation of friends and acquaintance, and ef|fectually deprived of doing any bu&s;ine&s;s or even tran&s;|mitting what might procure per&s;ons who were &s;ome

But I can po&s;itively a&s;&s;ure you, Gentlemen, that &s;o far from ever committing &s;uch an action, you may rely upon it that the deed never once exi&s;ted in idea: but Gentlemen fully re|lying upon your integrity, I humbly &s;ubmit this im|portant ca&s;e to your candid con&s;ideration</P>

<P>Mr <HI>Ben&s;on,</HI> the States Attorney, then got up and made a few ob&s;ervations to the Jury; but was very &s;hort and conci&s;e in his remarks.</P>
<P>The Honorable Judge then ro&s;e up and gave a charge to the Jury, which was very unfavourable to the pri&s;o|ner, for he appeared to con&s;ider the bond as a forgery, and that <HI>Jacob Ott</HI> had &s;poken the truth, in giving in his te&s;timony. The Jury then went out, and in three fourths of an hour returned, all agreed, and pronounced the pri&s;oner at the bar, <HI>not guilty,</HI> which words were no &s;ooner &s;poken than the numerous body of &s;pectators, made the whole hou&s;e re&s;ound with a univer&s;al acclama|tion, which plainly te&s;tified their joy at Mr <HI>Morhou&s;e's</HI> &s;ucce&s;s in not falling a victim to &s;elfintere&s;ted motives.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Morhou&s;e</HI> then de&s;ired to know of the Honorable Court, if they ever intended to bring him to Trial, on the other Indictment; the Court an&s;wered in the arffi|mative, be then de&s;ired to be brought down to an&s;wer them the next day, as &s;ome of the witne&s;&s;es were from a di&s;tance, and upon expences which made it difficult for them to tarry, but he received no an&s;wer, but was ordered back to pri&s;on without being admitted to bail or trial until the next &s;etting of the <HI>Court.</HI></P>

<L>NEAR Hud&s;on's lucid &s;tream, all on a rock alone,</L>
<L>Columbia's genius &s;at, and pen&s;ive made her moan;</L>
<L>The briny tear ran trickling down amain,</L>
<L>Her heaving brea&s;t expre&s;s'd her inward pain;</L>
<L>The laurel wreath her &s;apient temples bound,</L>
<L>With rage &s;he tore, and da&s;h'd it on the ground:</L>
<L>At length I &s;aw her rai&s;e her &s;treaming eyes,</L>
<L>To Heav'n, with lifted hands, the Godde&s;s cries:</L>
<L>I &s;ee my country's fate once happy land</L>
<L>Where truth and ju&s;tice once went hand in hand:</L>
<L>My children's rights was guarded by good laws,</L>
<L>Mercy give judgement&mdash;truth fir&s;t tried the cau&s;e;</L>
<L>It ne'er was known a man condemn'd to die</L>
<L>On groundle&s;s evidence for forgery;</L>
<L>Laws &s;hould be founded on&mdash;true equity:</L>
<L>No life fell victim&mdash;to a Judas' tribe,</L>
<L>Who'd &s;ell his brother for a paltry bribe.</L>
<L>By &s;uch ba&s;e means&mdash;behold! with pitying eye,</L>
<L>One of my &s;ons, unhappy youth! mu&s;t die.</L>
<L>Young Morhou&s;e, whom a Judas did betray,</L>
<L>A murd'ring witne&s;s &s;wore his life away:</L>
<L>A villain, who poor Purdy's<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>In Digby, Nova-Scotia, for wich he was branded as a villain.</HI></NOTE> blood did &s;hed,</L>
<L>Branded by ju&s;tice, from Nova-Scotia fled.</L>
<L>Fly, villain fly! thou ne'er can'&s;t have re&s;t,</L>
<L>Corro&s;ive guilt lies cank'ring in thy brea&s;t;</L>
<L>Lamented youth, adieu I mourn thy fall,</L>
<L>May Heav'n the dreadful &s;entence yet recall;</L>
<L>May ju&s;tice give to each their due reward,</L>
<L>May Morehou&s;e live&mdash;may virtue be his guard,</L>
<L>To u&s;e that life aright&mdash;if once be&s;tow'd,</L>
