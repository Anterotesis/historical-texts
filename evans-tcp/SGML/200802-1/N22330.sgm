<OPENER><SALUTE>Worthy and honored Friends and Brothers,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>GREAT is the plea&s;ure with which I embrace the opportunity that your kind invitation has given me of addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to you this day&mdash;a day which, I tru&s;t, will ever be joyfully remembered by you all;&mdash;a day in which, by the In&s;tallation of the Ma&s;ter and other Officers of a Lodge of Ma|&s;ons in this city, the influence of that vene|rable fraternity will be extended, and the bands of mutual love and good-will &s;trength|ened among them;&mdash;A day in which the pre&s;ence of &s;o many Brothers from the
<PB N="6" REF="029481_0005_0FE13C3372836580">
neighboring Lodges met together to culti|vate the principles of mutual love, and &s;pread its happy influence, mu&s;t cheer the heart and exhilarate the &s;pirits of every humane man.</P>
<P>BOTH as a Mini&s;ter of that Go&s;pel which proclaimeth peace and good-will to man|kind, and as one of the common brother|hood of men, I feel my&s;elf deeply intere&s;t|ed in the honor, pro&s;perity, and happine&s;s of every Society, who&s;e object is the peace, order, and welfare of the human race; and who&s;e aim is the e&s;tabli&s;hment and cultiva|tion of unity, brotherly love, and benevolence among its &s;everal branches.</P>
<P>THIS is the profe&s;&s;ed de&s;ign of your &s;oci|ety. It con&s;iders the helple&s;&s;ne&s;s of the in|fantine &s;tate of man, the wants and nece&s;&s;i|ties of his mature age, the numberle&s;s evils attendant on his declining years, as &s;o many proofs that "it is not good for man to be a|lone"&mdash;that in a &s;olitary, unconnected &s;tate, <HI>He could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t,</HI> or could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t with &s;afety and &s;ati&s;faction to him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="029481_0006_0FE13C3921A5FF98">
ANOTHER proof that man was made for &s;o|ciety ari&s;es from the tender feelings of which his heart is &s;u&s;ceptible; of which, indeed, without violence and often repeated efforts it cannot be dive&s;ted; from the &s;ympathetic angui&s;h which ri&s;es in it at the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of others; from the thrillings of joy and glad|ne&s;s with which it is delighted by the pro&s;|pect of human happine&s;s; from the &s;oft e|motions and extacy of plea&s;ure which &s;pring from the reciprocal offices of friend&s;hip and love.&mdash;The&s;e all proclaim that God intend|ed man for &s;ociety&mdash;that every individual of the human race &s;hould be a help and com|fort to every other.</P>
<P>To give full energy to the&s;e happy princi|ples of human nature, and carry them to their utmo&s;t effect, to cultivate natural know|ledge and acquired arts, and to di&s;&s;eminate their principles and improvements for the comfort and benefit of man, as well as to har|monize the &s;oul, and bring the tender affec|tions of his nature into action, is the profe&s;|&s;ed purpo&s;e of the Ma&s;onic in&s;titution. It commences its origin from the origin of man,
<PB N="8" REF="029481_0007_0FE13C3C8E776A38">
becau&s;e, from his origin, man hath ever wan|ted the advantage of knowledge, and arts, and humane affections to en&s;ure and make perfect the happine&s;s of &s;ocial life. Through various forms and degrees of refinement it hath hitherto &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in the world, &s;ome|times clouded in ob&s;curity, and &s;ometimes, &s;hining in &s;plendor; now di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by per&s;e|cution and oppre&s;&s;ion, then cheri&s;hed by the favor of the world and the countenance of great men and princes. The former &s;tate a|ro&s;e from the ignorance and the prejudices of narrow-minded men, the latter from the im|provement of the human mind by knowledge and liberality of &s;entiment.</P>
<P>BUT whatever was its outward condition in the world, whether per&s;ecuted or cheri&s;h|ed, Ma&s;onry was &s;till the &s;ame; &s;till it labor|ed to promote the peace and harmony of the world, by cultivating the principles of bene|volence and love; &s;till it &s;ought the happi|ne&s;s of men, by advancing the knowledge of Architecture, Agriculture, Manufactures, and Commerce; &s;till it endeavored to promote the pro&s;perity of &s;ocial life, by re&s;training the tempers and enlivening the affections which
<PB N="9" REF="029481_0008_0FE13C428A6725A0">
could either retard or advance it. Human happine&s;s was its object, and that object it kept ever in view. Through evil report and good, it &s;till pur&s;ued it. Though &s;ometimes di&s;appointed of its aim, it renewed its at|tempts: Though baffled by human infirmi|ty, and po&s;&s;ibly by the fault and ill conduct of particular members, it pur&s;ued its point, it repeated its efforts, its object was &s;till before it, &s;till the end of its warme&s;t wi&s;hes, of its mo&s;t zealous endeavors.</P>
<P>EXACTLY does the Ma&s;onic in&s;titution in this re&s;pect, coincide with the morality of that holy religion, to the profe&s;&s;ion of which the mercy of God hath called us. To e&s;tabli&s;h this a&s;&s;ertion, I recommend to your attention the exhortation of St. Paul, which I purpo&s;e for the &s;ubject of my pre&s;ent di&s;cour&s;e. It is recorded in
<Q><BIBL>HEB. XIII. 1.</BIBL>
LET BROTHERLY LOVE CONTINUE.</Q></P>
<P>I HAVE the rather cho&s;en this text becau&s;e it will give me the opportunity of contribu|ting my endeavors to promote the good pur|po&s;es of your Society and the end of this day's
<PB N="10" REF="029481_0009_0FE13C463A3B3618">
&s;olemnity, by enforcing the precepts and &s;pi|rit of that amiable and divine Religion which we profe&s;s, re&s;pecting brotherly love and be|nevolence&mdash;a principle which, did it engage the hearts, and regulate the actions of men, would calm all their di&s;cordant pa&s;&s;ions and partial views, and bind them together, as &s;trong cement binds together the materials of a building, which without it would part and fall a&s;under.</P>
<P>THIS religion, I tru&s;t, is not only ours by profe&s;&s;ion, but by its being the ruling prin|ciple in our hearts; and that it will bring every thought and de&s;ign, every temper and pa&s;&s;ion in obedience to its divine precepts. Its importance demands our utmo&s;t attention; and that attention will convince us that Chri|&s;tianity furni&s;hes mankind with the be&s;t phi|lo&s;ophy, and mo&s;t perfect in&s;titutions of life; that it contains not only the be&s;t &s;y&s;tem of moral duties that is extant, but, in truth, the only &s;y&s;tem that is fully adapted to the nature and condition of man in this world; being exactly &s;quared to his circum&s;tances, and le|velled to his capacity; laying the &s;ure foun|dation for his happine&s;s; tending to rai&s;e
<PB N="11" REF="029481_0010_0FE13C4C12E157F0">
his powers and faculties to their highe&s;t perfection, to cement together the whole brotherhood of men, and build them up an edifice of love, &s;upported by the two grand pillars of virtue and holine&s;s, the light and &s;trength of the world.</P>
<P>THE precepts of this religion which enjoin love and charity are very numerous, and ex|pre&s;&s;ed in the &s;tronge&s;t and plaine&s;t terms: And rea&s;on, as well as experience, evinces the nece&s;&s;ity of the&s;e precepts, to procure and pre&s;erve the happine&s;s of the human &s;pecies. Born in weakne&s;s and ignorance, entirely de|pendant on the care and protection of others; how &s;oon mu&s;t man fall a prey to tho&s;e num|berle&s;s evils which &s;urround him, did not the tenderne&s;s of love, and &s;ympathy of affection prevent it? And as he grows up to more ma|ture age, he &s;till continues indebted to the &s;ame amiable principles for almo&s;t all his en|joyments. Bodily &s;trength comes too late to protect him again&s;t injuries, and experience comes too late to point out the road to hap|pine&s;s. He mu&s;t depend on the protection and in&s;truction of others; and nothing but love and affection can excite others to afford
<PB N="12" REF="029481_0011_0FE13C5126173498">
this protection, or give this in&s;truction. And in his be&s;t e&s;tate, when bodily &s;trength is perfected; when rea&s;on has come to matu|rity, and in&s;truction and experience &s;upply their utmo&s;t help, the greater part of his happine&s;s mu&s;t ari&s;e from the affectionate and &s;ocial tendencies of his nature.</P>
<P>LOOK at the malignant and baneful pa&s;|&s;ions and tempers with which his nature is now unhappily deba&s;ed, and you will be immediately convinced of the truth of what I have &s;aid. Malice, and revenge, and ill-na|ture carry their own torment with them.&mdash;They <HI>may,</HI> and they probably <HI>will,</HI> vex, and and fret and torment tho&s;e again&s;t whom they are exerted: But, at the &s;ame time, they <HI>mu&s;t</HI> torment the bo&s;om which indulges them; and, while they prevail, render it incapable of any rational enjoyment. To have menti|oned this matter is enough: It carries its own evidence along with it, and needs no elaborate proof to convince us of its reality. We know that ill-nature and malice make tho&s;e who indulge them mi&s;erable in them&s;elves, and odious to all around them. And we know that the benign and &s;ocial propen&s;ities of our
<PB N="13" REF="029481_0012_0FE13C5675BAD260">
nature give plea&s;ure in their exerci&s;e, and en|&s;ure happine&s;s wherever they are practi&s;ed.</P>
<P>IN this view, then, as well as in all other views, the Chri&s;tian Religion de&s;erves our be&s;t regards. It teaches us to con&s;ider mankind as one common brotherhood&mdash;the children of the &s;ame parent, and members of the &s;ame family&mdash;allied to each other by partaking of the &s;ame nature, and being &s;ubject to the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ities and infirmities: And it directs us to &s;eek and promote their happine&s;s by all the means that &s;hall be in our power; to comfort the afflicted, to protect the weak, to relieve the oppre&s;&s;ed, to &s;upport the indigent, to in|&s;truct the ignorant, to admini&s;ter, in &s;hort, to the various nece&s;&s;ities of mankind, as God &s;hall ble&s;s us with ability and opportunity.&mdash;It forbids all malevolent de&s;igns and intenti|ons, as well as the open and avowed acts of malice; and it carries the principle of love and charity &s;o high, as to require the forgive|ne&s;s of real injuries, and the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of even our ju&s;t anger.</P>
<P>ALL the writers of the New Te&s;tament,
<PB N="14" REF="029481_0013_0FE13C59D0546F68">
however they may vary in the enumeration of the other virtues, and in the encomiums they be&s;tow upon them, are unanimous in gi|ving this of brotherly love the preference; making it pre-eminent in its &s;tation, in its in|fluence, and excellency above them all.</P>
<P>THE adorable Je&s;us, the great lover of men, declares that command of God, which enjoins us to love our neighbor as our&s;elves, to be e|qual to that great command which requires us to love the Lord our God with all our hearts; and &s;ays, that on the&s;e two command|ments, the love of God and man, all the Law and the Prophets do hang: Thereby more than intimating to us, that the foundation of all <HI>moral</HI> precepts, lies in this love of God and man; and that nothing in morality has any virtue or real excellency in it, but as it is de|ducible from, or may be referred to one or o|ther of the&s;e principles.</P>
<P>ST. James calls this law which commands the love of our neighbor, the <HI>Royal Law;</HI> thereby declaring its excellency and pre-emi|nence: And a&s;&s;ures us that the whole train of &s;ocial duties is fulfilled by fulfilling this law, <HI>Thou &s;halt love thy neighbor as thy&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="029481_0014_0FE13C631B8ECF40">
ST. Paul repre&s;ents Love to others as a debt which, though due to all, can never be paid &s;o as to cancel its obligation, and declares, in expre&s;&s;ions &s;imilar to tho&s;e of St. James, that the whole law, or obligation of duty, which one man owes to another, is fulfilled by ob|&s;erving this one precept, <HI>Thou &s;halt love thy neighbor as thy&s;elf.</HI> And in the conclu&s;ion of his epi&s;tle to the Hebrews, the &s;trong &s;en&s;e he had of it returns upon his mind with &s;uch force, that he could not help mentioning it, as nece&s;&s;ary to complete the Chri&s;tian character, <HI>Let brotherly love continue.</HI> He &s;aith nothing of the commencement of it. It already &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted among Chri&s;tians. Chri&s;tians they could not be without it&mdash;it was woven into their religion, and made a part of it. Their duty, therefore, required them to nouri&s;h it, to &s;up|port and maintain it, to regulate their hearts and actions by it, to pur&s;ue it through all its branches, and follow wherever it led them. It was one of the fruits of the Spirit of God, and at no rate to be neglected.</P>
<P>FROM the Spirit of God it hath de&s;cended and become the profe&s;&s;ed principle of the Ma|&s;onic
<PB N="16" REF="029481_0015_0FE13C69218D9D68">
fraternity: For wherever the principle of brotherly love is, wherever it re&s;ides and governs the pa&s;&s;ions and actions of men, there is the Spirit of God; for <HI>God is love;</HI> and "there is none good but one, that is God."</P>
<P>BE this love then the Line which directs your conduct, the Square by which to form the rectitude of your principles and actions, the Plummet to try their uprightne&s;s, the Le|vel to a&s;certain their conformity to the Al|mighty Architect; and let its Compa&s;s em|brace the whole human race. Love hath ever di&s;tingui&s;hed your fraternity: Let, therefore, brotherly love continue. It will give reputa|tion to your Society, &s;tability to the Lodge this day in&s;talled, and make it an ornament to the city in which we live. Love to others, a de&s;ire to promote their happine&s;s will en&s;ure re&s;pect. Real worth alone can acquire real dignity, and propriety of conduct only can &s;e|cure re&s;pect, either to individuals, or to bodies of men.</P>
<P>I HAVE thought it needle&s;s to take up your time in explaining what is meant by <HI>brotherly love.</HI> The feelings of your own hearts will do
<PB N="17" REF="029481_0016_0FE13C69218D9D68">
that better than the mo&s;t elaborate de&s;cripti|on. Let us only remember that <HI>every</HI> man is our brother, being all the children of the &s;ame common parent, God Almighty, and the ex|tent of the duty will be immediately percei|ved. Only con&s;ider the common wants and nece&s;&s;ities of this brotherhood&mdash;that its hap|pine&s;s can no otherwi&s;e be promoted, and the variety of evils to which it is expo&s;ed no oth|erwi&s;e prevented than by loving one another, and the rea&s;onablene&s;s of the duty will be clearly &s;een. Only reflect, that to love one another, to delight in doing good to all, to cultivate the tender, benign, and &s;ocial pro|pen&s;ities of our nature, is the command of our Creator, and the obligation of the duty will be &s;trongly felt. Only recollect, that God hath declared him who hateth his brother to be a murderer, and that he mu&s;t have his por|tion with apo&s;tate &s;pirits&mdash;that He, God him|&s;elf is the e&s;&s;ence of love; and that he who loves his brother re&s;embles his Creator, and &s;hall enjoy everla&s;ting felicity with him in hea|ven, and the motives to the practice of the duty will be too forcible for an ingenuous mind to re&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="029481_0017_0FE13C6CF8FD1C80">
HOW unhappy is it for the world that un|thinking man attends &s;o little to the&s;e con&s;id|erations! How much of the mi&s;ery which man endures, how many of the evils under which he con&s;tantly groans, might be pre|vented by cultivating this amiable, this divine quality! Look at the calamities that over|&s;pread the earth&mdash;What we call the evils of nature, &s;ickne&s;s and accidents, &s;torms and tem|pe&s;ts, thunder and earthquakes, bear no pro|portion to tho&s;e evils which the malevolent and baneful pa&s;&s;ions of men bring on it. War alone hath done more mi&s;chief, hath de&s;troy|ed more of the human race, hath brought more mi&s;ery into the world, than all of them together. And whence come wars and fight|ings among men? come they not from their unbridled lu&s;ts and malignant pa&s;&s;ions? How dreadful is the &s;ituation! how melancholy the pro&s;pect, when brotherhoods of men arm them&s;elves for mutual de&s;truction!</P>
<P>TO have mentioned this horrible &s;tate of human depravity is enough to expo&s;e its e|normity. With plea&s;ure I turn from &s;uch a theme, to the contemplation of the amiable
<PB N="19" REF="029481_0018_0FE13C731901E6B8">
qualities of affection and benevolence, which fir&s;t founded that brotherhood to which I have, this day, the plea&s;ure of addre&s;&s;ing my|&s;elf; and which hath cemented it together, and built it up, an edifice of love, a temple of unity and concord. May God pro&s;per their endeavors to extend the ble&s;&s;ings of peace, friend&s;hip, love, and knowledge through the world!</P>
<P>IN cultivating this principle you are enga|ged; a principle on which human happine&s;s mu&s;t be built. Of this happine&s;s the foun|dation was laid by God his Creator, when he gave man tho&s;e tender, benign, and &s;ocial feel|ings which are the greate&s;t ornament and high|e&s;t perfection of his nature. To rear the fair fabrick to this perfection; to bring to matu|rity that &s;eed of &s;alvation which was &s;own in the hearts of all men, when God &s;aid, <HI>The &s;eed of the woman &s;hall brui&s;e the head of the &s;er|pent,</HI> was the end the Son of God, the adora|ble Savior of men, had in view, when he took our nature upon him. He therefore went about doing good, cultivating the ten|der propen&s;ities of that nature he had a&s;&s;um|ed,
<PB N="20" REF="029481_0019_0FE13C789468D698">
calling into action all the amities and cha|rities of the human heart, enforcing them by his precepts, and confirming them by his ex|ample; making it the very mark and e&s;&s;enti|al characteri&s;tic of his di&s;ciples, that they &s;hould <HI>love one another.</HI></P>
<P>TO further this ble&s;&s;ed di&s;po&s;ition, and give it its utmo&s;t efficacy, is your profe&s;&s;ed de&s;ign; and as, I tru&s;t, it has the warme&s;t wi&s;hes of your hearts, I tru&s;t, al&s;o, it will have the ut|mo&s;t exertions of your abilities to bring it to perfection. In this bu&s;ine&s;s you are workers together with God, and fellow-laborers with Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles, and with all good men.</P>
<P>PERMIT me then with the affection of a brother who earne&s;tly wi&s;hes your pro&s;perity, as well as with the authority of a mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel of peace and good-will to men, who&s;e greate&s;t glory it is to recommend that Go&s;pel to men, and make it effectual to their &s;alvation, to put you in mind of your obliga|tions in this re&s;pect, and earne&s;tly to exhort you, not to be weary in doing good, but to <HI>let brotherly love continue,</HI> and mark all your con|ver&s;ation as Chri&s;tians, as well as Ma&s;ons.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="029481_0020_0FE13C7DB35B6A48">
THE evil propen&s;ities of wicked men will, it is true, ri&s;e up in oppo&s;ition; and the ma|lignant pa&s;&s;ions of human nature will coun|teract the benevolent de&s;ign of your holy re|ligion, as well as of your particular in&s;tituti|on. But the&s;e, by their contrariety, will on|ly add to the &s;plendor of your glory, and make the virtue of your conduct the more con&s;pic|uous, while you &s;trive to bring order and peace out of confu&s;ion and di&s;cord, and to make friend&s;hip and love triumphant over en|mity and malice.</P>
<P>RECOLLECT, therefore, that all the words and actions of men,&mdash;the whole tenor and particulars of their lives&mdash;are noted by God who made them, and will by him be brought into judgment. Not only &s;o; but their open conduct is viewed and &s;canned, and judged by their fellow-men; and that they will e&s;teem or di&s;regard the particular Society to which they belong, not only according to the worth of its in&s;titutions and regulations, but al&s;o according to the conduct of tho&s;e who are members of it. Of the in&s;titutions of Ma|&s;onry, it may, I a&s;&s;ure my&s;elf, be ju&s;tly a&s;&s;er|ted,
<PB N="22" REF="029481_0021_0FE13C80DC7946B0">
that they are calculated to promote the happine&s;s of the world. Let then the con|duct of Ma&s;ons be an&s;werable to them. Let the force of their good in&s;titutions appear in their deportment. Let truth and ju&s;tice, &s;o|briety and mode&s;ty, courte&s;y and affability, liberality and candor, affection and love, be|nevolence and charity mark their whole con|duct, and &s;hew to the world, that they are the faithful &s;ervants of the merciful Savior of men, united by particular badges and in&s;titu|tions, to do good to mankind by promoting their happine&s;s. Then &s;hall their fellow-men regard and re&s;pect them: God will look with favor upon them and ble&s;s them: This tem|porary life will be clo&s;ed in the &s;ati&s;faction of having done good in their generation, and the merit of their Redeemer will carry them to the eternal kingdom of peace and love.</P>
