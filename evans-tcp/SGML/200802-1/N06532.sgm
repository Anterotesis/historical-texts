<Q><HI>Think not that I am come to &s;end Peace on Earth: I came not to &s;end Peace, but a Sword.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>JUDGING only by our natural partial Ideas of the divine Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s, and from our inadequate Views of the De&s;igns of Providence, we &s;hould be ready to con|clude, that when the <HI>Father of Mercies,</HI> the <HI>God of Peace,</HI> &s;ent his <HI>only begotten Son</HI> into the World, on a Me&s;&s;age of Love to Mankind, one principal De&s;ign of his Mi&s;&s;ion had been, to com|po&s;e the Nations, and e&s;tabli&s;h Peace in this lower World; that he had cru&s;hed all the Sons of Vio|lence, and &s;et up a Kingdom again&s;t which no Na|tion had dared to exalt it&s;elf; that all his Di&s;ciples, by their Profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity, had been &s;ecured from the Wrath and Violence of a wicked and re&s;tle&s;s World; that he had &s;aid to the World, <Q>Touch not mine Anointed, nor do my Prophets Harm;</Q> that every Attempt to di&s;turb their Tranquility, had been puni&s;hed with immediate Vengeance, Fire from Heaven to devour them. And when, in Contradiction to all &s;uch Expectations, we find that the Church of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> has, in every Age, &s;hared in the Calamities common to Mankind: and more than this, when we find it has been the pe|culiar Object of the implacable Malice of the World;
<PB N="2" REF="008289_0005_102E8113E6E34AB0">
that <HI>the Kings of the Earth have &s;et them&s;elves, and the</HI> Princes <HI>taken Coun&s;el together again&s;t the Lord, and again&s;t his Chri&s;t;</HI> &s;uch a Conduct in divine Providence, leads us to wonder at the De&s;igns of Providence, &s;o contrary to what Rea&s;on &s;eem'd to &s;ug|ge&s;t: we are tempted to &s;ay, there is one Event to the Righteous and to the Wicked; were there an in|finitely wi&s;e and good Being, that pre&s;ided over the Affairs of Mortals, &s;urely we &s;hould not &s;ee real Chri&s;tianity depre&s;&s;ed, and Sin reign and triumph; we &s;hould not find the Church of God a Field of Blood, under the long-expected Reign of the glo|rious <HI>Prince of Peace.</HI></P>
<P>To teach us therefore, how apt we are to form wrong and inadequate Notions of the Methods of God's Government; to give Relief to our Minds under tho&s;e Di&s;couragements, that the Events of Providence are apt to produce; and that no one might mi&s;take the Nature, the De&s;ign and Privi|leges of his Kingdom, our Saviour has plainly told us what we are to expect; he has pointed out what is like to be the Condition of his People, and taught us not to wonder, when we &s;ee all the&s;e Things come to pa&s;s: <HI>think not that I am come to &s;end Peace on Earth; I came not to &s;end Peace, but a Sword.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Ver&s;e, to any one, who will con&s;ider the Tenor of our Saviour's Di&s;cour&s;e, is &s;ufficiently plain, and void of Difficulty; and leads us, on this Occa|&s;ion, to con&s;ider the following Things; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>

<P><PB N="3" REF="008289_0006_102E81168D4CFFB0">
<HI>Secondly,</HI> THE Agency of God, in the Wars and Mi&s;eries common to this State of the World.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> THE Rea&s;ons of the divine Conduct in this Affair.</P>
<P>1^s^t. WE are to con&s;ider the Chri&s;tian-Church, as &s;haring in the Calamities common to a degenerate World, e&s;pecially that of War.</P>
<P>GOD was plea&s;ed of old, for wi&s;e Purpo&s;es, to take a particular People, the Seed of <HI>Abraham,</HI> into a peculiar Covenant with Him&s;elf: He &s;eparated them from all the Nations of the Earth, He dealt with them as he did not with any other Nation, He gave them Laws different from all other Nations; and as it was nece&s;&s;ary in that Age, before <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Immortality</HI> were brought to Light by <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> He invited them to the Wor&s;hip and Obedience of the True God, by the certain Promi&s;e of temporal Rewards, and deter'd them from Idolatry and Di&s;obe|dience, by the Threatnings of temporal Judgments. The&s;e Promi&s;es and Threatnings were a con&s;idera|ble Part of God's Covenant with that People: if they obey'd and &s;erv'd him, they were &s;ure of Pro&s;|perity; that God would draw a Line of Protection around them; that all their Enemies &s;hould flee be|fore them:&mdash;But, if they for&s;ook God, and went after the gods of the Nations, the Sword was threat|ned, to cut them off from under Heaven, I&s;ai. i. 19, 20. <HI>if ye be willing and obedient, ye &s;hall eat the Good of the Land; but if ye refu&s;e and rebel, ye &s;hall be devoured of the Sword, for the Mouth of the Lord hath &s;poken it.</HI> And according to the Tenor of this Covenant, God always dealt with that People; when they feared and obeyed Him, He &s;ubdued their
<PB N="4" REF="008289_0007_102E8118140A8610">
Enemies and gave them Peace and Re&s;t; but when they for&s;ook God, the Heathen had Dominion over them. To acquaint us how exactly God con|formed his Dealings to their moral Conduct, and to this Covenant, &s;o to teach us the Regard God has to Virtue, &s;eems to be one principal De&s;ign of the large <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> we have of that People in the <HI>Bible.</HI></P>
<P>SUCH Promi&s;es, and Threatnings, with a Conduct agreable to them, were &s;uitable and nece&s;&s;ary for that People. This was perhaps the only Method in which they could be brought to Obedience: Their &s;piritual Capacities and Di&s;coveries were but &s;mall, not &s;ufficient to govern them, without the immediate, and &s;en&s;ible Effects of Virtue and Vice. This was a Government exactly agreable to the Genius and Capacity of that People, and in this Way God's moral Dominion was long &s;upported.</P>
<P>BUT even then the Promi&s;es belonged to them as a People, and not to Individuals, as &s;uch. Hence we find even in that Day, Examples of &s;uffering Virtue, and triumphant Wickedne&s;s. The Pro&s;pe|rity of the Wicked, and Affliction of the Righteous, was a Subject that engaged the Attention, and exer|ci&s;ed the Patience of good Men, in that Day. A|mong that People, the Apo&s;tle tells us of &s;ome emi|nent Saints, that <HI>had Trial of cruel Mockings and Scourgings,&mdash;they were &s;toned, were &s;awn a&s;under, were tempted, were &s;lain with the Sword,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>THUS were the <HI>Jews</HI> taken into a peculiar Cove|nant with God, and as a People, were the Subjects of temporal Promi&s;es and Threatnings.</P>
<P>BUT upon God's &s;ending his Son into the World, the State of Things was much changed. That particular Covenant with the <HI>Jews,</HI> to which the&s;e
<PB N="5" REF="008289_0008_102E811AC7F746B0">
Promi&s;es belonged, was aboli&s;hed, the <HI>Jews</HI> were no longer con&s;idered as God's peculiar People. The Promi&s;es and Threatnings that belonged to their po|litical Being cea&s;ed; nor was there any Nation ap|pointed to &s;ucceed them. The <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing of Abra|ham,</HI> the &s;piritual Promi&s;es de&s;cended, from that Time, equally on <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles.</HI> Our Lord appeared, to &s;et up a Kingdom, that <HI>is not of this World,</HI> to reveal a <HI>New, a better Covenant;</HI> which was <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed upon better Promi&s;es;</HI> enforced not with temporary Sanctions, but with &s;piritual and eternal Motives; <HI>exceeding greet and precious Pro|mi&s;es,</HI> by which we are made <HI>Partakers of the divine Nature.</HI> The Go&s;pel is a Di&s;pen&s;ation of &s;uperior Light; in it Life and Immortality are &s;et before us in the cleare&s;t Light; its Promi&s;es are of a divine Na|ture, its Motives to Obedience are not temporal Peace, but &s;piritual Happine&s;s; Motives drawn from the World to come. The Obedience of the Go&s;|pel Covenant, is that of Faith; it flows from an un&s;haken Faith in the Rewards and Puni&s;hments of another Life; <HI>We walk by Faith, and not by Sight.</HI> Evangelic Religion, does not take its Ri&s;e from the Hope of Silver or Gold; but from the Love of God, the Love of our Redeemer; and a ble&s;&s;ed Faith and Hope in the Promi&s;es of future Glory. Chri&s;tians are not, under the Go&s;pel, con&s;idered in a political View, as the Nation of the Jews was; nor have we any Exemption from the Calamities that are common to Mankind: So far from this, that our ble&s;&s;ed Lord has expre&s;ly taught us, to ex|pect the peculiar Re&s;entment of the World, to be &s;ubject to the Sword, and fiery Per&s;ecutions, till that happy Day come when <HI>the Nations &s;hall learn War no more. I came not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o &s;end Peace on Earth but a

Sword;</HI> hence he goes on to arm and fortify his Di&s;|ciples, and &s;how them what a zealous Love to him|&s;elf, will be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport them, in their Obe|dience to him. <HI>He that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Father or Mother more than me, is not worthy of me; He that findeth his Life &s;hall lo&s;e it; and he that lo&s;eth his Life for my &s;ake, &s;hall find it.</HI> Argeably he tells them, Matt. v. 11, 12. <HI>ble&s;&s;ed are ye when Men &s;hall hate you, and per&s;ecute you and &s;ay all manner of Evil fal&s;ly again&s;t you for my &s;ake; Rejoice and be exceeding glad, for great is your Reward in Heaven. In the World ye &s;hall have Tribulation.</HI> So far is Chri&s;tianity from &s;ecuring temporal Pro&s;perity to its Profe&s;&s;ors, that Sufferings are every where in the New-Te&s;tament &s;uppo&s;ed to be the peculiar Lot of Chri&s;tians; they are taught to expect th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">; and one grand De&s;ign of the Go&s;pel is, by its noble Promi&s;es, to &s;upport the Faith, encourage the Hope, and &s;ecure the Stead|fa&s;tne&s;s of its Profe&s;&s;ors, under tho&s;e &s;hocking Trials they are taught to expect: And that this is not a State peculiar to the primitive Ages of Chri&s;tianity, but is like to la&s;t many Ages we learn from the Revelation of St. John, who tells us; <HI>and when they &s;hall have fini&s;hed their Te&s;timony, the Bea&s;t that a&s;|cendeth out of the bottomle&s;s Pit, &s;hall make War a|gain&s;t them and kill them,&mdash;and the Dragon was wroth with the Woman, and went to make War with the Remnant of her Seed, which kept the Command|ments of God, and the Te&s;timony of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> In a Word, the Events of many Ages, &s;erve to demon|&s;trate that no &s;uch Promi&s;es of temporal Pro&s;perity belong to the Church, as a political Body, as did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to the Nation of the Jews.

us in another Manner; we are arrived to a more perfect Age, and put on Trial upon more refined Principles and Motives; we have rea&s;on to expect, that Religion it &s;elf, will expo&s;e its Profe&s;&s;ors to the Malice <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> wicked World: Hence the Church is &s;aid to <HI>come out of great Tribulation and to wa&s;h their Robes, and make them white in the Blood of the Lamb.</HI></P>
<P>HENCE, it plainly follows that the earthly Pro|mi&s;es and Threatnings, propo&s;ed to God's ancient People, are ill <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to Chri&s;tians, con&s;idered in a political View-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nder the Go&s;pel. What Right have any to apply the Promi&s;es of worldly Felicity, made to a particular People; under a peculiar Co|venant, long &s;ince confe&s;&s;edly aboli&s;hed, to Chri&s;|tians, who are evidently under another Covenant, a more &s;piritual Di&s;pen&s;ation; who are con&s;idered in the Go&s;pel, not as political Societies, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> this propo&s;ed as one e&s;&s;ential Condition of their &s;alvation, that they <HI>deny them&s;elves,</HI> and be ready to &s;acrifice all, even Life it&s;elf, in the Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e of Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>I KNOW the great Apo&s;tle of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> tells us, that <HI>Godline&s;s is profitable unto all Things, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ing Promi&s;e of the Life that now is:</HI>&mdash;That our ble&s;&s;ed Ma&s;ter promi&s;es to them, that <HI>&s;eek <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the Kingdom of God,</HI> that <HI>all the&s;e Things <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> added unto them;</HI> He once &s;aid, <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are the Meek, for they &s;hall inherit the Earth;</HI>&mdash;<Q>not that they &s;hall al|ways have much of the Earth.</Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> But it is ob&s;erva|ble, that the Promi&s;es in the New-Te&s;tament, that look this Way, re&s;pect Chri&s;tians not in a political Form, (for no &s;uch political Con&s;titutions were then foun|ded among them,) but as Individuals; and 'tis ne|ce&s;&s;ary to under&s;tand them in a limited Sen&s;e, as

intimating to us the natural Connection of Holine&s;s and Happine&s;s, how much true Religion contributes to our comfortable Enjoyment of this World, and that Believers may &s;afely tru&s;t in the Providence of their heavenly Father, <HI>who &s;ends his Rain upon the Ju&s;t and upon the Unjust.</HI> It is undeniable evident, that no &s;uch Promi&s;es are ab&s;olutely in Force; for we find in Fact, they are not literally fulfil'd, either to particular Chri&s;tians, or Societies of Chri&s;tians. Experience convinces us, that many eminent Men are as remarkable for their Poverty, and Affliction, as for their Piety: that the mo&s;t eminent Chri&s;tians have died Martyrs to the Malice of the World, and the Faith of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>IT is readily granted that Sin and Mi&s;ery, Virtue and Happine&s;s are nearly connected; that public Virtue is the natural Parent of public Happine&s;s. The Go&s;pel is excellently adapted to advance tem|poral Pro&s;perity;&mdash;Peace, Harmony and good Or|der, are naturally grafted on the Chri&s;tian Sy&s;tem. Nothing can more powerfully tend to advance hu|man Happine&s;s, even in this Life, than the refined Morality of the Go&s;pel. But how often do we &s;ee the Order of things inverted, the Tendency of Vir|tue ob&s;tructed, in this World of moral Di&s;order! Chri&s;tians don't feel that Felicity, for which the chri&s;tian Precepts are divinely adapted. Indeed God may interpo&s;e, and cau&s;e Religion to have its genuine Effects;&mdash;I don't &s;ay, his Providence does not in this State &s;ometimes give us a vi&s;ible Token of his Ap|probation of Religion, (tho' I make no doubt, this was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> Ages of the World, than

BUT after all, Wars and Fightings come from the Lu&s;ts of Men: they have their Origin in that Lu&s;t of Riches and Dominion &s;o common to a de|generate World. It is Ambition and Coveteou&s;ne&s;s that have, thro' all Ages, depopulated Kingdoms, &s;ubverted Empires, and delug'd this World in Blood and Ruin. Wars are vi&s;ible &s;ad In&s;tances, awa|kening dreadful Demon&s;trations, of the deep Cor|ruption of human Nature; &s;uch unnatural Events, as proclaim Mankind awfully deviated from the Rule and Order of their Being; awfully lo&s;t to the no|ble Principles of Humanity; filled with that malig|nant Hatred, that is not to be found in the brutal World.

<P>As to the Church of Chri&s;t, the Sword may be &s;ent to refine and purify it. This is a Di&s;cipline by which God tries the Fidelity of Chri&s;tians, brightens their Virtues, and prepares them for a Crown of Life: and if God is plea&s;ed to exerci&s;e his Children with &s;evere Di&s;cipline; if they <HI>&s;uffer with Chri&s;t</HI> here, <HI>and reign with Him</HI> hereafter, who can &s;ay that God is unrighteous; &s;eeing this is but a Proba|tion-Life, that perfect Rewards and Puni&s;hments are re&s;erv'd for the next Life, when <HI>every one &s;hall re|ceive according as his Works &s;hall be?</HI></P>
<P>MOREOVER, the Sword often &s;erves to cha&s;tize the Church for their Apo&s;tacy. Chri&s;tians often fall into great Apo&s;tacy and lo&s;e the Power, and in a Mea&s;ure, the Form of Godline&s;s; they often need the Rod to &s;courge, awaken and reclaim them: this is frequently the Ca&s;e, when Chri&s;tians have enjoy|ed long Peace and Pro&s;perity; they need &s;ome &s;e|vere Di&s;cipline to recover them.</P>

Good to my Country. We are indeed to look on this Nece&s;&s;ity as the Judgment of God. We are to cultivate the Arts of War, as be&s;ide the genuine Tendency of our holy Religion; neverthele&s;s nece&s;|&s;ary in this State of Di&s;order. The &s;kilful Defen|ders of our Lives and Liberties are great Ble&s;&s;ings to Mankind. Does it not create Anxiety in every con&s;iderate Mind, to find, that after &s;o many Years Exerci&s;e in War, military Skill and Di&s;cipline have received no greater Improvements?

How highly nece&s;&s;ary is it that our Troops know how to approach, and retreat from an Enemy in unbroken Order, and to with&s;tand the furious Shock of a regular Army? Providence therefore calls us to make great Improvements in this nece&s;&s;ary Science. This good Land, which God gave to our Fathers, with the noble Privileges tran&s;mitted to
