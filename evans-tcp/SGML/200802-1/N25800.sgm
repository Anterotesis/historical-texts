</EPIGRAPH>
<P>TO under&s;tand the nature of the objects a|round us, ju&s;tly to e&s;timate their value is a high attainment of knowledge.</P>
<P>HAVING informed our minds and obtained right opinions, then to direct our de&s;ires, our pur&s;uits, and our zeal, according to the nature of their ob|ject, is the &s;ummit of human goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>THE hu&s;bandman, therefore, may highly value his farm, the mechanic his &s;hop, the mariner his com|pa&s;s, the man of &s;cience his books; becau&s;e the&s;e things are nece&s;&s;ary to their mode of living.</P>
<P>THE man of moral reflection, enquiring whence his origin, what his de&s;tination, what his pre&s;ent du|ty, what his future pro&s;pects, finds the go&s;pel e&s;&s;en|tial to his peace here, to his happine&s;s hereafter. To him the go&s;pel is precious. He is "blind." He ex|plores the re&s;ources of his own mind; he learns the philo&s;ophy of the wi&s;e; he finds light, only, in the volume of revelation. His conduct is wrong; his pa&s;&s;ions lead him 'captive.' To re&s;train him&s;elf he thinks of his intere&s;t, of his reputation; he finds commanding motives of goodne&s;s, only in the book of God. Here he reads the &s;inner's end; he trembles; he obeys. To bind our lu&s;ts, reputation and intere&s;t are no better than Samp|&s;on's bur&s;ting cords.</P>
<P>IMPERFECT man feels remor&s;e, his &s;pirit is 'bro|ken;' he concludes him&s;elf under condemnation; the revelation of chri&s;tians furni&s;hes a balm to 'heal'

his bleeding heart. With terrors he is en&s;laved; the go&s;pel gives 'liberty' and joy. The text a&s;|cribes to the go&s;pel all the&s;e excellencies. The go&s;|pel <HI>heals the broken hearted,</HI> con&s;oles the angui&s;h of a guilty con&s;cience: it gives freedom to the &s;laves of &s;in: It gives <HI>&s;ight to the blind,</HI> knowledge to tho&s;e ignorant of moral truth.</P>
<P>TO ILLUSTRATE THE VALUE OR EXCELLENCE OF THE GOSPEL IS OUR PRESENT OBJECT.</P>
<P N="1">I. THE chri&s;tian revelation is excellent; it teach|es men what to BELIEVE re&s;pecting God, them&s;elves and a future &s;tate: It directs the FAITH of man|kind. This is a circum&s;tance of the greate&s;t im|portance; for the faith of men will ever, more or le&s;s, influence their conduct.</P>
<P>TRUTHS, the mo&s;t intere&s;ting to the heart of man are no where di&s;covered but in the oracles of God.</P>
<P>THE religious opinions of tho&s;e de&s;titute of reve|lation are, in general, &s;o many gro&s;s ab&s;urdities.&mdash;That we may &s;ee the value of <HI>our</HI> privileges, let us for a moment recollect the articles of faith among the mo&s;t enlightened nations of the heathen world.</P>
<P>PRIESTS and Philo&s;ophers taught, and the people believed, there was a plurality of gods.</P>
<P>THE Romans had three hundred Jupiters. Un|der &s;o many names they wor&s;hiped this deity.</P>
<P>THE Greeks reckoned thirty thou&s;and gods, there were finally in the heathen catalogue two hundred and eighty thou&s;and gods.</P>
<P>CATTLE, Cats, and Crocodiles, were among the divinities of Egypt.</P>
<P>PHILOSOPHERS taught that creation from nothing was impo&s;&s;ible; that matter was eternal; that there was no &s;uch thing as a fir&s;t bird, nor a fir&s;t man; that the gods had not power to make a good man unhappy; that pain was no evil; that a wi&s;e man was happy in the mid&s;t of tortures; that the gods were in &s;hape like men, but of a larger &s;ize.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="034306_0006_0FFC390FE1A1DD00">THESE are a few articles of a philo&s;ophic creed.</P>
<P>PEOPLE and Philo&s;ophers believed the re&s;pon&s;es of oracles, the preten&s;ions of fortune-tellers, the ef|ficacy of divination, the power of witchcraft, the piety of ob&s;erving dreams, &s;igns and omens, for|tunate and unfortunate days. Some of the&s;e hea|theni&s;ms, remain in chri&s;tian countries.&mdash;The&s;e chri&s;tians are like tho&s;e 'Children, who &s;poke half in the &s;peech of A&s;hdod, and could not &s;peak the Jews language' in purity.</P>
<P>AT Athens it was believed that deformed chil|dren might be murdered or expo&s;ed to peri&s;h alone. Hipa&s;us and Heraclitus taught that god was fire: Parmenides, that he was compo&s;ed of earth and fire.</P>
<P>ZENO maintained that all crimes were equal; that injuries are never to be forgiven. Cleanthes in|&s;tructed &s;ons and daughters to roa&s;t and eat the fle&s;h of their parents.</P>
<P>EPICURUS denyed the providence of God: He allowed men to co-habit with their daughters and mothers. That parents might &s;acrifice and eat their own children was a doctrine of the Cynic philo&s;o|phers. Ideas of immortality the heathen have; but how low, how &s;en&s;ual!</P>
<P>THE paradi&s;e of the Alcoran forbids de&s;cription. In the other world the &s;avage expects the plea&s;ures of the cha&s;e, and the indulgence of ea&s;e. It is com|mon in heathen countries to bury with the dead, or de|po&s;it near their graves the fir&s;t articles of enjoyment.</P>
<P>IN the Caroline I&s;les they place near the graves of their friends, fruits and other eatables.</P>
<P>THE Savage of America buries with the decea&s;ed what he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, the mo&s;t valuable.</P>
<P>IN India, with their kings, they bury a number of animals, and &s;uch ve&s;&s;els of &s;ilver and gold, as they think will be mo&s;t u&s;eful in a future life.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="034306_0007_0FFC390E58878A80">IN the &s;tates of Barbary they carry ve&s;&s;els of wa|ter and provi&s;ions to the graves of their friends. This office is repeated every friday, as long as friends or relatives &s;urvive, who retain kindne&s;s, to per|form &s;uch an act of &s;uppo&s;ed friend&s;hip. They have no belief, no conception of joys &s;uperi|or to tho&s;e experienced here.</P>
<P>HOW different, how much more excellent is the FAITH of chri&s;tians in all the&s;e particulars!</P>
<P>THE chri&s;tian revelation teaches us there is ONE GOD the creator and governor of the univer&s;e, that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es all divine perfections. The go&s;pel teach|es us what MAN is, a fallen creature, "being in ho|nour he abode not." The go&s;pel teaches us, there is a MEDIATOR; that there is &s;alvation for the be|lieving, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t; that there will be a general re&s;urrection; that the righteous will be re|warded according to their works, the wicked pu|ni&s;hed.</P>
<P>A LIGHT &s;hines; the curtain is drawn; we have a glance beyond the grave. We may learn where our &s;pirits may be while our bodies are conveyed to "the narrow hou&s;e of death;" where they may dwell while ages of ages in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion pa&s;s.</P>
<P>THE faith of the chri&s;tian is the &s;ub&s;tance of things for which he hopes. But to tho&s;e intimate with the doctrines of chri&s;tianity we need not be particular.</P>
<P>HAD not the Lawgiver of I&s;rael, nor the Prophet of Bethlehem in&s;tructed us, in&s;tead of the truths of revelation, we might have embraced the creed of pagans. Does not the go&s;pel open blind eyes? Does it not direct the FAITH of mankind? Has it not in|valuable excellence?</P>
<P N="2">II. THE chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem is excellent, it mends the morals of mankind: It regulates their practice.</P>
<P>To determine what chri&s;tianity has done towards the regulation of morals, we mu&s;t again recur to the pagan world.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="034306_0008_0FFC390C24309660">IT is nece&s;&s;ary to examine heathen, and compare it with chri&s;tian morality.</P>
<P>IF we ob&s;erve the morals of a Paul, a Stephen, and innumerable other &s;aints; how great is the contra&s;t between them, and a Nero, a Mahomet, and an Attila?</P>
<P>HOW divine the chri&s;tian appears! If we com|pare with Pagans, tho&s;e who have only a theoretic knowledge of the go&s;pel; the advantage, in gene|ral, is va&s;tly on the &s;ide of chri&s;tianity</P>
<P>WITH all their guilt the believers in revelation appear almo&s;t like Angels, when contra&s;ted with the profe&s;&s;ors of any other religion.</P>
<P>THE Heathen did not think them&s;elves obliged to be better than their Gods. Many of the&s;e they &s;uppo&s;ed immoral and cruel: their conduct was approved and imitated. Accordingly, in &s;ome part of Africa and Terrafirma the chief &s;ervants of a prince, at his death, were murdered to &s;erve him in the other world. The heathen temples have commonly been a&s;ylums for the wor&s;t criminals. In Algiers a Turk may with impunity murder three Moors, or five Arabs, if he flee to a mo&s;que where a marabout hermit, or &s;aint has been buried.</P>
<P>HE may murder eleven Jews, and find &s;ecurity in any mo&s;que. Where &s;omewhat like this prevails in countries <HI>called</HI> chri&s;tian, they have really retur|ned to pagani&s;m.</P>
<P>THE author of chri&s;tianity allows not one immo|rality. The African and Indian &s;hores receive the a&s;hes of the living widow in the &s;ame blaze, which con&s;umes her decea&s;ed hu&s;band. They had &s;ham|bles for &s;elling human fle&s;h to be eaten in Jago, Hi&s;paniola and Brazil. The Tartars &s;uck the blood of wounded, dying per&s;ons. The Indians of Cana|da fea&s;ted on the bodies of their captives. At the pre&s;ent time &s;everal nations of Africa expo&s;e tho&s;e children they do not like, to be eaten of wild bee it
<PB N="10" REF="034306_0009_0FFC3909EC060500">
On the banks of the Danube it was the cu&s;tom to ca&s;t their new born infants into the river; tho&s;e who could &s;wim were taken up and pre&s;erved; the others &s;lept in their watry grave. Others killed their parents at a certain age, and fea&s;ted on their fle&s;h. The Mingrelians bury their own children a|live. In mo&s;t heathen countries, and lately in France, <HI>&s;ince they have rejected chri&s;tianity,</HI> they at plea|&s;ure di&s;&s;olve the marriage relation. Nothing is ne|ce&s;&s;ary for a divorce in that "TERRIBLE REPUBLIC" but a month's warning from the hu&s;band or wife. In the city of Paris alone, five hundred and &s;ixty-two divorces took place in three months.</P>
<P>THE Per&s;ians married their daughters, their &s;i&s;|ters and their mothers. The connection is for life, or any particular time. In Tartary the father mar|ries his own daughter, or &s;ells her to the Turks, or Per&s;ians. When people become infirm thro' great age, or &s;ome di&s;ea&s;e thought incurable, they are left to peri&s;h alone.</P>
<P>THE religion of Zoroa&s;ter allows ince&s;t. A rem|nant of his followers remain in Per&s;ia and India. The licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the Spartans in the conjugal relation, their cu&s;toms at &s;ome of their fe&s;tivals&mdash;I may not de&s;cribe. In Peru it was cu&s;tomary to fat and eat their own children born of captives, whom as concubines they kept for that purpo&s;e. When they became too old for this, they were kill|ed and eaten. Such is the morality of nations ne|ver taught by the Redeemer of I&s;rael. The world by their wi&s;dom do not know God; but give them|&s;elves up to vile affections.</P>
<P>THE heathen Philo&s;ophers taught that bloody wars, merely for conque&s;t, were ju&s;t; that revenge was no crime. Their precepts armed one man a|gain&s;t another.</P>
<P>NOT &s;o does the philanthropi&s;t of Nazareth in|&s;truct his di&s;ciples. From his precepts we learn that
<PB N="11" REF="034306_0010_0FFC39079C6FBD48">
humility is a virtue, that forgivene&s;s is a duty, that we &s;hould love our neighbour as our&s;elves, that we &s;hould treat others as we de&s;ire to be treated.</P>
<P>IT is one grand de&s;ign of the go&s;pel to unite man with man, and nation with nation; to form the world into one family of perfect morals.</P>
<P>SUCH will be the effect when the influence of the go&s;pel &s;hall be complete. No impiety, no wars, no criminal de&s;igns, will pain the heart of goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>THE good Samaritan, bearing the wounded &s;tranger to the Inn; the poor widow giving away her whole living, exemplifies the excellence of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>WHEN religious truth is powerfully impre&s;&s;ed on the minds of a family, a neighborhood, a church; we &s;ee, we feel how happy are the effects of the chri&s;tian religion. In the me<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ne&s;s, the endear|ing kindne&s;s, the unaffected goodne&s;s of &s;ome per|&s;ons, we form an idea of the millenium, we form &s;ome imperfect idea of Heaven.</P>
<P>I &s;hould abu&s;e Chri&s;tianity; I &s;hould wrong many beloved friends, to deny I had &s;een &s;uch a &s;pirit.</P>
<P>MIGHTY is the go&s;pel to attract man to man; to harmonize their minds; to unite them in di&s;inter|e&s;ted love; to regulate their moral conduct. Were it not for the benign precepts of chri&s;tianity, is it not probable we &s;hould &s;acrifice our children, fea&s;t on our parents, be guilty of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t immorali|ties?</P>
<P>THE humane, the benevolent, the divine precepts of Chri&s;t teach us better; pre&s;erve us from the&s;e kinds of wickedne&s;s; in&s;truct us in a perfect moral|ity; require us to vi&s;it the fatherle&s;s and the wi|dow in their affliction; to do ju&s;tly, to love mercy and walk humbly with our God.</P>
<P>THE MORALS taught by the &s;on of Jo&s;eph in the Synagogues of I&s;rael, the de&s;erts and mountains of
<PB N="12" REF="034306_0011_0FFC3904A5BA2848">
Judea, as far &s;urpa&s;s all other &s;y&s;tems, as the &s;ubli|mities of nature are &s;uperior to the works of art, as the creation of God excels the labor of man. Who then can de&s;cribe the excellence of the go&s;|pel?</P>
<P N="3">III. THE revelation of chri&s;tians is precious; it teaches them in what manner to wor&s;hip <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P>BY the powers of rea&s;on men have never di&s;co|vered with what &s;acrifice to appear before God. Here revelation is our only guide. Of this <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 words"> be convinced, if we recollect with what horrid vices, the different Pagan nations have wor&s;hiped their Gods.</P>
<P>WHILE we are &s;peaking in terms not the mo&s;t re&s;pectful of the heathen faith &amp; wor&s;hip, it may be ju&s;tly acknowledged that their Philo&s;ophers Se|neca, Tully, Antoninus, Zeno, Socrates, and others, taught many very excellent truths. But from what authority? What convictions, what reforma|tion did they produce in others or them&s;elves? After all the fine things he has written, Cicero &s;ays, "Whether the &s;oul be <HI>immortal</HI> or not, is a very great question."</P>

Zeno, the father of &s;toici&s;m, mur|ders him&s;elf to e&s;cape the pain of a broken finger. Cato de&s;troyed him&s;elf with circum&s;tances too hor|rible for de&s;cription.</P>
<P>THESE are the men, ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, whom thy foes name as rivals to thee. Their errors, their vi|ces, are more favorably regarded than thy &s;potle&s;s morals, thy benign doctrines, thy godlike benevo|lence, thy glorious death, thy maje&s;ty on the cro&s;s, thy power of rai&s;ing the dead, thy revelations from heaven, thy perfection of character, is brought down to a level with worms, who tremble before an idol, or madly wallow in their own blood.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="034306_0012_0FFC3902C71F3248">FOR a moment we are to attend pagan wor&s;hip. A <HI>full</HI> view is improper. No words are delicate e|nough to de&s;cribe in a chri&s;tian a&s;&s;embly all their modes of wor&s;hip. Too indecent &s;ome are to be named.</P>
<P>STILL it is hoped &s;ome freedom of &s;peech will be excu&s;ed, as the &s;ubject is important, and not gene|rally known.</P>
<P>AT Sparta boys were &s;courged on the altar of Di|ana till they expired</P>
<P>IN the region of Indo&s;tan, it is common for the Farquirs, voluntarily to undergo tortures dreadful to relate. They have &s;trong iron hooks thru&s;t through the fle&s;h of their bodies; then getting them&s;elves drawn up into the air, they are whirled round in the mo&s;t violent manner with machines made for the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>IN Mexico as an atonement for their &s;ins, or a preparation for a &s;olemn fe&s;tival, they mangled their fle&s;h till the blood profu&s;ely flowed. At the fa&s;t of the Tla&s;calans, which la&s;ted one hundred and &s;ixty days, the chief prie&s;t with about two hundred per&s;ons a&s;cended a high mountain: When they came down they had a great number of little knives and &s;mall rods given them. The fir&s;t day they bored their tongues, through which they drew the rods, and notwith&s;tanding, their exce&s;&s;ive pain, and lo&s;s of blood, they were obliged to &s;ing aloud hymns to their gods. This operation was repeated every twenty days. At the end of eighty days, a general fa&s;t of the people began which continued an equal time.</P>
<P>IN &s;ome places they performed their wor&s;hip by cutting off pieces of their own fle&s;h and ca&s;ting them at the idol.</P>
<P>HOW terrible is pagani&s;m compared with the mild &s;pirit of Je&s;us!</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="034306_0013_0FFC39004BAC6F10" MS="y">THE remaining part of the de&s;cription is &s;till more dreadful.</P>
<P>WE have the te&s;timony of the be&s;t witne&s;&s;es; we have the mo&s;t certain evidence, that lewdne&s;s con|&s;tituted a part of heathen wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>WE have one in&s;tance recorded by Mo&s;es in the &s;tory of Zimri and Gozbi. They were &s;lain not for a <HI>&s;ecret</HI> crime, but a public offering to Baal Pe|or.</P>
<P>THE Greeks wor&s;hiped &s;ome of their gods with the &s;ame abomination.</P>
<P>WHEN Antiochus Epiphanes converted the Tem|ple at Jeru&s;alem into a temple for Jupiter. "It was filled with riot and revelling by the gentiles, who dallied with harlots&mdash;within the circuit of the ho|ly places." 2d Macc. 6.4.</P>
<P>JUVENAL &s;ays, "In what Temple are not women defiled?" Among the ea&s;tern nations after the mourning with which their fe&s;tivals began, the re&s;t of the time was &s;pent in mirth and jollity, in de|bauchery, adultery, and ince&s;t. The&s;e were their religious a&s;&s;emblies. A con&s;iderable revenue is now collected for the temples of Indo&s;tan from the pro&s;|titution, there encouraged. Refering to this cu&s;tom as ancient as the old Te&s;tament, God &s;ays, "Thou &s;halt not bring the hire of a harlot into the hou&s;e of the Lord thy God." Deut. 23.18.</P>
<P>AT Babylon every woman was obliged once in her life to vi&s;it the temple dedicated to lu&s;t. Sure|ly the&s;e were &s;ervices performed for Devils.</P>
<P>I HASTEN to fini&s;h this awful picture by inform<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> you, that in all quarters of the globe, fal&s;e gods have been wor&s;hiped by human &s;acrifices. The Queen of Xerxes cau&s;ed 14 boys of the noble&s;t families in Per&s;ia to be buried alive, a &s;acrifice to the infernal gods. The Scythians &s;acrificed to Mars one out of every hundred of the captives, they took in war. In the I&s;land of Ceylon, and the whole
<PB N="15" REF="034306_0014_0FFC38FD9B798220">
region of the Indians human &s;acrifices were common. The altars of Moloch, in the land of Canaan were &s;tained with human blood. In Gaul they inclo&s;ed a man in a kind of wicker work, and burnt him in honor of the Gods.</P>
<P>THE banks of the Nile drank the blood of human victims.</P>
<P>UPON extraordinary occa&s;ions, the Romans offer|ed their children on their country's altars. Marius &s;acrificed his own daughter. The &s;ame practice prevailed in Greece. Themi&s;tocles &s;acrificed three women to Bacchus. A daughter was offered on the altar by a king of Athens.</P>
<P>THE Carthagenians, not only immolated their own children in hundreds, but them&s;elves al&s;o in times of calamity.</P>
<P>ON the i&s;lands lately di&s;covered in the &s;outh &s;ea, their &s;acred places are cumbered with &s;kulls of men offered to evil &s;pirits.</P>
<P>IN Peru they tied a living man to a &s;take, pulled his fle&s;h from his bones in &s;mall pieces; broiled and eat it before his eyes.</P>
<P>IN Terrafirma the natives honoured their divini|ties with offerings of human blood.</P>
<P>IN Mexico they annually &s;acrificed twenty thou|&s;and men.</P>
<P>THE aborigines of Canada, of Virginia, and of New-England, &s;ometimes, offered men to their ma|lignant deities.</P>

<P>THESE are the people from whom we are de&s;cend|ed. And why are not we, their children, this e|vening employed in &s;acrificing a kind friend, a faith|ful parent, or a weeping babe?</P>
<P>WHAT has made us to differ? What has taught us to wor&s;hip Jehovah in a more wi&s;e manner? Is it not revelation alone which has opened our blind eyes, taught us rational piety, brought us into com|munion with God.</P>
<P>It is the chri&s;tian revelation, which in&s;tructs us to wor&s;hip ONE GOD "to wor&s;hip him in &s;pirit and truth, to call upon him out of a pure heart, to lift up holy hands without wrath or doubting:" Chri&s;tianity in&s;tructs us to addre&s;s God in the name of the medi|ator; to pray in &s;ecret, in public; to intercede for all mankind. So rational, &s;o benevolent is the wor&s;hip of chri&s;tians. All round the globe cruelties, &s;elf-murder, lewdne&s;s, human &s;acrifices, have con&s;tituted their religious &s;ervices, but where the go&s;pel is known there is a wor&s;hip, adapted to the nature of man, the purity and goodne&s;s of God.</P>
<P N="4">IV. THE chri&s;tian doctrines are valuable; they unite men to God. The chri&s;tian loves God. He contemplates God as his guardian, his friend, his father. The religion of pagans did not attach them
<PB N="17" REF="034306_0016_0FFC38F8E0691A98">
to their divinities. Their affection to the objects of their wor&s;hip, we may &s;ee in Suetonius, one of their own hi&s;torians.</P>
<P>HE &s;ays, "they were &s;o angry with their Gods at the death of Germanicus, that they battered their temples with &s;tones, overthrew their altars and flung their hou&s;ehold divinities into the &s;treets." The&s;e were the enlightened Romans.</P>
<P>DU HALDE a&s;&s;ures us "That the Chine&s;e, after offering largely to their Gods, and being di&s;appoin|ted of their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;ometimes <HI>&s;ue</HI> them, and ob|tain decrees again&s;t, them from the Mandarines."</P>
<P>Do &s;uch facts need any comment? It is the chri&s;tian alone, who loves God. The perfections, the honor, the family of God, are all dear to the chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>THE chri&s;tian loves the cau&s;e of God, more than his own intere&s;t. The chri&s;tian lives to do good, to promote his makers cau&s;e. Joyful are tho&s;e days, devoted to his God, nor is life dear when the happi|ne&s;s of others, the glory of God, demands the &s;acrifice. So benevolent, &s;o &s;elf denying is the chri&s;tian temper. Then, is not the go&s;pel precious?</P>
<P N="5">V. THE excellence of the go&s;pel is vi&s;ible in its preparing Believers for death.</P>
<P>WHAT are the &s;upports of the Pagan in that &s;eri|ous hour, which awaits the &s;ons of men? What was the hope of the renowned Brutus, when he pronoun|ced Virtue an empty name, and &s;heathed his &s;word in his own vitals?</P>
<P>WHAT are all the heathen rites; what all the philo&s;ophy of the wi&s;e; what all the energetic rea|&s;onings of our own minds, as we approach the aw|ful darkne&s;s of another world?</P>
<P>THE go&s;pel alone brings con&s;olation in that dreary-dreadful moment. The &s;anctifying influence of re|velation prepares the chri&s;tian to die in peace with him&s;elf, his connections and his God. A divine hope animates his departing &s;pirit. He depends on the
<PB N="18" REF="034306_0017_0FFC38F4EA6DB5A8">
Mediator, who has made propitiation for his &s;ins and the &s;ins of the whole world. Je&s;us has made an a|tonement. He has died, the ju&s;t for the unju&s;t. He is exalted to give repentance and remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, The penitent &s;inner is pardoned, his name is written in the volume of life. An interce&s;&s;or is at the fathers right hand. See the holy chri&s;tian in his la&s;t mo|ments. Would he exchange his bed of death, for the thrones of unbelievers?</P>
<P>HE is pale, helple&s;s, dying. His phy&s;ician has re|tired. No hope of life remains; his friends weep; their hearts are wrung with grief. He &s;ees their tears he hears their &s;ighs, their de&s;pair is vi&s;ible. Sympathi&s;ing in their di&s;tre&s;s; in&s;pired with humble triumph; he &s;ays: "weep not for me"&mdash;"See how a chri&s;tian can die." His voice fails. The parent who would die in his &s;tead, cannot procure him an hours reprieve. The brother, who&s;e &s;oul is tenderne&s;s, endures not the &s;cene; his agonizing cries to God cannot be heard. The wife, frantic with angui&s;h, is bidding adieu to hope, and every earthful bli&s;s; &s;he leans o|ver the cold pillow.&mdash;The departing &s;aint ca&s;ts a fix|ed gaze on the friend of his heart: he looks with unde&s;cribable tenderne&s;s. Still he enjoys divine peace, his countenance is &s;erene. Faith bears him a|bove the terrors of death, by faith he fees beyond the borders of life; the grave clouds not his pro&s;pect. Vi&s;ions of approaching bli&s;s cheer his &s;pirit. He &s;ees a divine inheritance, a heaven of joy, a throne of glory, a golden crown, a &s;potle&s;s robe, adoring &s;aints, waiting angels, a &s;miling God.</P>
<P>ABSORBED in the&s;e rava&s;hing views, he whi&s;pers: "Tell me, my &s;oul, can this be death?&mdash;where is thy &s;ting? When &s;hall I die; when &s;hall I live forever!" Often in &s;uch a frame the chri&s;tian leaves the world.</P>
<P>WHERE can the pagan find &s;uch con&s;olations in his la&s;t hour, where di&s;cover &s;uch enrapturing views?</P>
<P>WILL not all ble&s;s God for the glorious go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t?</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="034306_0018_0FFC38F24112EED0">HAVING endeavoured to &s;hew the value of the chri&s;tian revelation; we proceed to make &s;ome general reflections, which the &s;ubject may pre|&s;ent.</P>
<P N="1">1. DOES not the divine excellence of the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem call Mini&s;ter and people, cordially, to unite in promoting its &s;ucce&s;s?</P>
<P>UPON our cordial union, upon our affording com|fort and encouragement to one another the &s;ucce&s;s of the go&s;pel very much depends.</P>
<P>FROM divine ordinances very little can be hoped where there is &s;trife or alienation.</P>
<P>SHALL the golden talent be lo&s;t, becau&s;e we have not mutual kindne&s;s?</P>
<P>THE blood of &s;ouls will then crim&s;on our gar|ments. If we exerci&s;e not a friendly, mutual regard, we refu&s;e to imbibe a chri&s;tian temper; the benevo|lent tendency of revelation encrea&s;es our guilt. For tho&s;e, who receive &s;uch valued ble&s;&s;ings from each o|ther; for tho&s;e united for &s;uch glorious purpo&s;es, not to be cordially attached is ungrateful, is unnatu|al.</P>
<P>I PRAY God, we may hope better things of our|&s;elves.</P>
<P>ON his part your Pa&s;tor has no complaint; but many favors to acknowledge. He has, ever experi|enced much of your affectionate regard, your &s;ym|pathy, your candor, your kindne&s;s. May HE, who records the &s;malle&s;t act of goodne&s;s, and the mo&s;t &s;e|cret wi&s;h of love, repay you ten thou&s;and fold, and give you a di&s;ciples reward.</P>
<P N="2">2. FROM the excellence of the go&s;pel, we infer, tho&s;e have a bad ta&s;te and erroneous judgment, who prefer worldly plea&s;ures to religious privileges.</P>
<P>THE precepts of Je&s;us form you a&s;&s;ociates for the &s;ons and daughters of glory; they make the world, the univer&s;e thy own: "all things are yours."&mdash;Tho&s;e, who choo&s;e earthly things, prefer atoms to

worlds; had rather grope in darkne&s;s, than &s;hine as &s;tars, and walk with &s;aints in light. They de&s;ire not to join in the &s;ongs of the redeemed, nor li&s;ten to the harps of angels; but to grovel with "&s;erpents and vipers." Have &s;uch per&s;ons a &s;ound judgment? Have they a ta&s;te for the &s;ublime or beautiful? what objects ever &s;truck the heart of man or angels more grand or noble, than tho&s;e pre&s;ented in the admini&s;|tration of the go&s;pel?</P>
<P>LET the children of earth prefer the world; &s;ub|mit to no &s;elf-denial for the go&s;pel; live as you wi&s;h; pre&s;s to thy heart the fa&s;cinating objects of &s;en&s;e! But will they cheer your mind in the agonies of death?</P>
<P>WILL they calm your horrors in the tremendous &s;cenes of the great day?</P>
<P>IF it be more nece&s;&s;ary, than earthly bli&s;s, for doubt|ing, trembling man to emerge from clouds of moral darkne&s;s to enjoy the light of truth; to ap|proach near and nearer &s;till to the temper of &s;pirits glorified; to learn &s;o to wor&s;hip God, that he may &s;ay: "Command ye me;" if it be more nece&s;&s;ary than &s;inful plea&s;ure to a candidate for glory, to attain immortal union with him who&s;e &s;mile is heaven; with triumphant hope to enter the dreary vale of death; then compared with the go&s;pel, what are all the objects, that enchant the &s;inners heart?</P>
<P>THE privileges of a chri&s;tian are the only means of effecting the&s;e glorious purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>REVELATION is ab&s;olutely NECESSARY to the religious improvement of mankind.</P>
<P>WITHOUT revelation a rational piety would not be practi&s;ed in the world. There is no good evidence that in any quarter of the globe a &s;ingle kingdom, &s;tate, province, city, or village, ignorant of revela|tion, has ju&s;t notions of providence, or a becoming wor&s;hip of the true God, or well founded comforts in death.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="034306_0020_0FFC38EEE025F718">SEVERAL thou&s;and years they have had to make improvements in religion: they are wrapt in the black-&s;hades of pagani&s;m.</P>
<P>WHERE is one country or town to be excepted? I a&s;k the Dei&s;t of univer&s;al &s;cience: where can I find one hamlet thus ble&s;t?&mdash;He is &s;ilent. No &s;uch &s;pot has an exi&s;tence.

<P N="3">3. IF the go&s;pel is &s;o veluable; we ought to pray for its exten&s;ion and &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>'PRAY for the peace of Jeru&s;alem; they &s;hall pro&s;|per, who love her.' What reque&s;t can be more im|portant, more benevolent, more acceptable to God?</P>
<P N="4">4. IF the go&s;pel is &s;o precious, then is it a ble&s;&s;ing to be a Mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>INSTANTLY it may be objected, that "His life is retired&mdash;few are attached to his per&s;on&mdash;many grudge him their &s;ervices&mdash;he is dependent&mdash;abu|&s;ed."</P>
<P>ALL this may be true, yet who would not be a Mini&s;ter of Je&s;us, the prince of peace? Is it no com|pen&s;ation for difficulties to admini&s;ter the WORD of eternal life? Is it no privilege to teach tho&s;e, we love as our own &s;ouls, what faith will &s;ave the &s;oul, what is pure morality, what the true wor&s;hip of GOD? Is it no privilege to be an Agent in preparing our friends for death, for heaven, for immortal glory? One, who had been in perils much, in deaths oft, could &s;ay: "I thank Chri&s;t Je&s;us our Lord, who hath enabled <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the mini&s;try."</P>
<P>THIS was no enthu&s;ia&s;t; but a man of &s;cience and genius. Great is the privilege; plea&s;ant the work to admini&s;ter comfort to the broken hearted; to &s;olve

the doubts of the enquiring; to exhibit to all the knowledge of &s;alvation.</P>
<P N="5">5. FROM the excellence of the chri&s;tian revelation, we &s;ee how very wicked are mankind.</P>
<P>A GREAT part of tho&s;e, who read and hear the go&s;pel, neglect, de&s;pi&s;e, hate and oppo&s;e its doctrines and &s;pirit. They had rather peri&s;h forever, than de|ny them&s;elves to obey its laws. With &s;uch light, with &s;uch convictions, to abu&s;e redeeming mercy; what amazing guilt! How much more aggravated are their &s;ins than pagans? More dreadful will their eternity be. The man of tears, who complains: 'They hated me without a cau&s;e.' 'Ye will not come unto me that ye might have life,' will &s;oon be their wrathful Judge.</P>
<P N="6">6. IF the go&s;pel is &s;o excellent, &s;o &s;uperior to all o|ther &s;y&s;tems of morality and theology; is not this good evidence, that it came from God?</P>
<P>How came the wanderers of the Arabian defert to fabricate a &s;y&s;tem of religion more excellent than any other nation? Is it a common event, or is it a prodi|gy unparalleled in the hi&s;tory of man for a company of &s;laves, marching from their ma&s;ters to frame wi&s;e &s;y&s;tems of divinity? If the I&s;raelites did not invent their theology, it was from the God of heaven. They could not borrow it from their tyrants, who were wor&s;hiping bea&s;ts and vegetables; nor from their neighbors, who from their own bo&s;oms tore their weeping babes to fea&s;t the devouring flames.</P>
<P>WAS it ever known that a carpenter's &s;on, born in a manger, educated in a cottage, employed as a me|chanic, with a few illiterate fi&s;hermen, ever invented a &s;y&s;tem of Truth, infinitely &s;urpa&s;&s;ing all previous, and &s;ub&s;equent productions of the human mind? The&s;e per&s;ons "bring immortality to light;" teach the unity of God; teach that God is LOVE; that repentance of &s;in and faith in Chri&s;t will &s;ave the &s;oul.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="034306_0022_0FFA6B765C7C9A40">THEY are the fir&s;t to tell us, our bodies for ages &s;lumbering, &s;hall ri&s;e, cloathed with glory or made ve&s;&s;els of wrath.</P>
<P>THEY pre&s;ent the awful grandeur of the la&s;t &s;o|lemn &s;cene. The world &s;hall blaze, the &s;un expire, the Heavens vani&s;h.</P>
<P>THE Greeks and Romans were charmed with the eloquence of philo&s;ophy. In other regions was ven|erated the au&s;terity of the Druids. Who can num|ber the followers of Confucius? Mahomet boa&s;ts of vi&s;ions and revelations; nations adopt his faith. Capac &s;hines like a beam of the fun.</P>
<P>BUT, as directions to future happine&s;s, what are all their doctrines collected, more than the jargon of Babel, if compared with the go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Is not the plan of redemption 'the wi&s;dom of God?' Is not every precept of chri&s;tianity cloathed with the authority of Jehovah?</P>
<P N="7">7. IF the go&s;pel is &s;o excellent, then it is a rich compen&s;ation for all the &s;acrifices we make for it.</P>
<P>THE ordinances of chri&s;tianity cannot be enjoyed without &s;ome &s;acrifices. Should your chri&s;tian pri|vileges co&s;t all your po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, co&s;t, your life, as they did the martyrs; this would be le&s;s than their value. If you enjoy the glad tidings of redemption for le&s;s than your precious &s;oul; they are profitable.</P>
<P>CHRISTIAN wi&s;dom is better than rubies or gold, better than fine gold, better than a revenue of choice &s;ilver.</P>
<P>JUSTLY prize the con&s;olations of religion, e&s;timate the joys of heaven; realize the torments of the dam|ned; number the days of eternity; calculate the worth of &s;ouls redeemed by Je&s;us Chri&s;t; then tell us what is too great a &s;acrifice for the go&s;pel of &s;al|vation.</P>
<P N="8">8. IF the go&s;pel is &s;o valuable, how intere&s;ting is that day or hour, which unites a Mini&s;ter and Peo|ple!</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="034306_0023_0FFC38E8EA2F6488">THE grand object of their union is to accompli&s;h the glorious de&s;igns of the chri&s;tian revelation. To enlighten, to reform, to &s;anctify, to &s;ave &s;ouls, is the great motive to continue the &s;acred relation. "Be thou faithful to this flock, and I will give thee a crown of life," is the voice of Heaven to the pa&s;|tor.</P>
<P>TO the people the voice is "for&s;ake not the a&s;&s;emb|ling of your&s;elves&mdash;where two or three are met in my name, there am I&mdash;hear and your &s;ouls &s;hall live."</P>
<P>THE unfaithful have nothing to hope.</P>
<P>"OH &s;on of man, if thou do&s;t not &s;peak to warn the wicked from his way, that man &s;hall die in his iniquity, but his blood will I require at thine hand.'</P>
<P>PEOPLE, carele&s;s, are &s;olemnly warned. "If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay it to heart to give glory unto my name, I will even &s;end a cur&s;e upon you, and I will cur&s;e your ble&s;&s;ings; yea I have cur|&s;ed them." The &s;alvation of Mini&s;ter and people is apparently, &s;u&s;pended on their mutual faithfulne&s;s. Deeply intere&s;ting, therefore, was the hour, which united us in this relation. With joy or woe the mo|ment will be recollected in eternity. Let us be care|ful then to perform the duties, we reciprocally owe each other.

<P><PB N="27" REF="034306_0026_0FFC38E2C78A5BE0">IT is &s;aid, they partake each others joys &s;hare each others griefs; have a mutual tenderne&s;s; are ani|mated with one &s;pirit.</P>
<P>WERE I to u&s;e the freedom of &s;peaking as I feel, I &s;hould adopt the&s;e &s;entiments as my own. Happy the Mini&s;ter, who has many &s;uch children; he may &s;peak with the enemy in the gate, nor be afraid.</P>
<P>REMEMBER, my Friends, the &s;olemn vows you have made to God; remember the reputation of the church, the &s;alvation of your own &s;ouls depends on the real &s;incerity of your religion. Finally: Ought we not all devoutly, to notice the good hand of our God in bringing us to another anniver&s;ary eve; to ble&s;s God that he has not denied us the precious go&s;|pel of &s;alvation?</P>
<P>WE know not what another year may bring forth. A night of affliction, the hour of final &s;eparation may be near,</P>
<P>LET us &s;trive to do good, to make each other hap|py to meet our God in peace.</P>
<P>THE go&s;pel is the only mean of &s;alvation; it is balm to the wounded; it is freedom to the captive; it is &s;ight to the blind. Ble&s;&s;ed are the people, who know the joyful &s;ound.</P>
