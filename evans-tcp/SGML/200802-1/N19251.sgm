<HEAD>TO M. TALLEYRAND-PERIGORD, LATE BISHOP OF AUTUN.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING read with great plea&s;ure a pam|phlet, which you have lately publi&s;hed, on Na|tional Education, I dedicate this volume to you &mdash;the fir&s;t dedication that I have ever written, to induce you to read it with attention; and, be|cau&s;e I think that you will under&s;tand me, which I do not &s;uppo&s;e many pert willings will, who may ridicule the arguments they are unable to an&s;wer. But, Sir, I carry my re&s;pect for your under&s;tanding &s;till farther; &s;o far, that I am confident you will not throw my work a&s;ide, and ha&s;tily conclude that I am in the wrong, be|cau&s;e you did not view the &s;ubject in the &s;ame light your&s;elf. And, pardon my frankne&s;s, but I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that you treated it in too cur&s;o|ry a manner, contented to con&s;ider it as it had been con&s;idered formerly, when the rights of man, not to advert to woman, were trampled on as chimerical&mdash;I call upon you, therefore, now
<PB N="vi" REF="025054_0004_0FCDB5356DEE9B20">
to weigh what I have advanced re&s;pecting the rights of woman, and national education&mdash;and I call with the firm tone of humanity. For my arguments, Sir, are dictated by a di&s;intere&s;ted &s;pirit&mdash;I plead for my &s;ex&mdash;not for my&s;elf. In|dependence I have long con&s;idered as the grand ble&s;&s;ing of life, the ba&s;is of every virtue&mdash;and independence I will ever &s;ecure by contracting my wants, though I were to live on a barren heath.</P>
<P>It is then an affection for the whole human race that makes my pen dart rapidly along to &s;upport what I believe to be the cau&s;e of virtue: and the &s;ame motive leads me earne&s;tly to wi&s;h to &s;ee woman placed in a &s;tation in which &s;he would advance, in&s;tead of retarding, the progre&s;s of tho&s;e glorious principles that give a &s;ub&s;tance to morality. My opinion, indeed, re&s;pecting the rights and duties of woman, &s;eems to flow &s;o naturally from the&s;e &s;imple principles, that I think it &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible, but that &s;ome of the enlarged minds who formed your admirable con|&s;titution, will coincide with me.</P>
<P>In France there is undoubtedly a more general diffu&s;ion of knowledge than in any part of the European world, and I attribute it, in a great mea&s;ure, to the &s;ocial intercour&s;e which has long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the &s;exes. It is true, I utter my &s;entiments with freedom, that in France the
<PB N="vii" REF="025054_0005_0FCDB53756D68EC0">
very e&s;&s;ence of &s;en&s;uality has been extracted to regale the voluptuary, and a kind of &s;entimental lu&s;t has prevailed, which, together with the &s;y&s;|tem of duplicity that the whole tenor of their political and civil government taught, have giv|en a &s;ini&s;ter &s;ort of &s;agacity to the French cha|racter, properly termed fine&s;&s;e, and a poli&s;h of manners that injures the &s;ub&s;tance, by hunting &s;incerity out of &s;ociety.&mdash;And, mode&s;ty, the faire&s;t garb of virtue! has been more gro&s;sly in|&s;ulted in France than even in England, till their women have treated as <HI>prudi&s;h</HI> that attention to decency, which brutes in&s;tinctively ob&s;erve.</P>
<P>Manners and morals are &s;o nearly allied that they have often been confounded; but, though the former &s;hould only be the natural reflection of the latter, yet, when various cau&s;es have pro|duced factitious and corrupt manners, which are very early caught, morality becomes an empty name. The per&s;onal re&s;erve, and &s;acred re&s;pect for cleanline&s;s and delicacy in dome&s;tic life, which French women almo&s;t de&s;pi&s;e, are the graceful pillars of mode&s;ty; but, far from de&s;pi&s;ing them, if the pure flame of patrioti&s;m have reached their bo&s;oms, they &s;hould labour to improve the mor|als of their fellow-citizens, by teaching men, not only to re&s;pect mode&s;ty in women, but to ac|quire it them&s;elves, as the only way to merit their e&s;teem.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="025054_0006_0FCDB539D85F78B0">Contending for the rights of woman, my main argument is built on this &s;imple principle, that if &s;he be not prepared by education to be|come the companion of man, &s;he will &s;top the progre&s;s of knowledge, for truth mu&s;t be com|mon to all, or it will be inefficacious with re|&s;pect to its influence on general practice. And how can woman be expected to co-operate un|le&s;s &s;he know why &s;he ought to be virtuous? unle&s;s freedom &s;trengthen her rea&s;on till &s;he com|prehend her duty, and &s;ee in what manner it is connected with her real good? If children are to be educated to under&s;tand the true principle of patrioti&s;m, their mother mu&s;t be a patriot; and the love of mankind, from which an orderly train of virtues &s;pring, can only be produced by con&s;idering the moral and civil intere&s;t of man|kind; but the education and &s;ituation of woman, at pre&s;ent, &s;huts her out from &s;uch inve&s;tiga|tions.</P>
<P>In this work I have produced many argu|ments, which to me were conclu&s;ive, to prove that the prevailing notion re&s;pecting a &s;exual cha|racter was &s;ubver&s;ive of morality, and I have con|tended, that to render the human body and mind more perfect, cha&s;tity mu&s;t more univer&s;ally pre|vail, and that cha&s;tity will never be re&s;pected in the male world till the per&s;on of a woman is not, as it were, idolized, when little virtue or &s;en&s;e

embelli&s;h it with the grand traces of mental beauty, or the intere&s;ting &s;implicity of affec|tion.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider, Sir, di&s;pa&s;&s;ionately, the&s;e ob&s;erva|tions&mdash;for a glimp&s;e of this truth &s;eemed to open before you when you ob&s;erved,
<Q>that to &s;ee one half of the human race excluded by the other from all participation of government, was a political phaenomenon that, according to ab|&s;tract principles, it was impo&s;&s;ible to explain.</Q>
If &s;o, on what does your con&s;titution re&s;t? If the ab&s;tract rights of man will bear di&s;cu&s;&s;ion and explanation, tho&s;e of woman, by a parity of rea&s;oning, will not &s;hrink from the &s;ame te&s;t: though a different opinion prevails in this coun|try, built on the very arguments which you u&s;e to ju&s;tify the oppre&s;&s;ion of woman&mdash;pre&s;crip|tion.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider, I addre&s;s you as a legi&s;lator, whe|ther, when men contend for their freedom, and to be allowed to judge for them&s;elves re&s;pecting their own happine&s;s, it be not incon&s;i&s;tent and unju&s;t to &s;ubjugate women, even though you firmly believe that you are acting in the manner be&s;t calculated to promote their happine&s;s? Who made man the exclu&s;ive judge, if woman partake with him the gift of rea&s;on?</P>
<P>In this &s;tyle, argue tyrants of every denomi|nation, from the weak king to the weak father
<PB N="x" REF="025054_0008_0FCDB53C79CA1140">
of a family; they are all eager to cru&s;h rea&s;on; yet always a&s;&s;ert that they u&s;urp its throne only to be u&s;eful. Do you not act a &s;imilar part, when you <HI>force</HI> all women, by denying them civil and political rights, to remain immured in their families groping in the dark? for &s;urely, Sir, you will not a&s;&s;ert, that a duty can be bind|ing which is not founded on rea&s;on? If indeed this be their de&s;tination, arguments may be drawn from rea&s;on: and thus augu&s;tly &s;upport|ed, the more under&s;tanding women acquire, the more they will be attached to their duty&mdash;com|prehending it&mdash;for unle&s;s they comprehend it, unle&s;s their morals be fixed on the &s;ame immuta|ble principle as tho&s;e of man, no authority can make them di&s;charge it in a virtuous manner. They may be convenient &s;laves, but &s;lavery will have its con&s;tant effect, degrading the ma&s;ter and the abject dependent.</P>
<P>But, if women are to be excluded, without having a voice, from a participation of the natu|ral rights of mankind, prove fir&s;t, to ward off the charge of inju&s;tice and incon&s;i&s;tency, that they want rea&s;on,&mdash;el&s;e this flaw in your NEW CONSTITUTION, the fir&s;t con&s;titution founded on rea&s;on, will ever &s;hew that man mu&s;t, in &s;ome &s;hape, act like a tyrant, and tyranny, in whatever part of &s;ociety it rears its brazen front, will ever undermine morality.</P>
<P><PB N="xi" REF="025054_0009_0FCDB5414EBC5AA8">I have repeatedly a&s;&s;erted, and produced what appeared to me irrefragable arguments drawn from matters of fact, to prove my a&s;&s;ertion, that women cannot, by force, be confined to dome&s;|tic concerns; for they will, however ignorant, intermeddle with more weighty affairs, neglect|ing private duties only to di&s;turb, by cunning tricks, the orderly plans of rea&s;on which ri&s;e above their comprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, whil&s;t they are only made to acquire per&s;onal accompli&s;hments, men will &s;eek for plea&s;ure in variety, and faithle&s;s hu&s;bands will make faithle&s;s wives; &s;uch ignorant beings, in|deed, will be very excu&s;able when, not taught to re&s;pect public good, nor allowed any civil rights, they attempt to do them&s;elves ju&s;tice by retalia|tion.</P>
<P>The box of mi&s;chief thus opened in &s;ociety, what is to pre&s;erve private virtue, the only &s;ecu|rity of public freedom and univer&s;al happine&s;s?</P>
<P>Let there be then no coercion <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed</HI> in &s;o|ciety, and the common law of gravity prevailing, the &s;exes will fall into their proper places. And, now that more equitable laws are forming your citizens, marriage may become more &s;acred: your young men may choo&s;e wives from motives of affection, and your maidens allow love to root out vanity.</P>
<P><PB N="xii" REF="025054_0010_0FCDB5439290C308">The father of a family will not then weaken his con&s;titution and deba&s;e his &s;entiments, by vi&s;iting the harlot, nor forget, in obeying the call of appetite, the purpo&s;e for which it was implanted. And, the mother will not neglect her children to practi&s;e the arts of coquetry, when &s;en&s;e and mode&s;ty &s;ecure her the friend&s;hip of her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>But, till men become attentive to the duty of a father, it is vain to expect women to &s;pend that time in their nur&s;ery which they 'wi&s;e in their generation,' choo&s;e to &s;pend at their gla&s;s; for this exertion of cunning is only an in&s;tinct of nature to enable them to obtain indirectly a little of that power of which they are unju&s;tly denied a &s;hare: for, if women are not permitted to enjoy legitimate rights, they will render both men and them&s;elves vicious, to obtain illicit pri|vileges.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h, Sir, to &s;et &s;ome inve&s;tigations of this kind afloat in France; and &s;hould they lead to a confirmation of my principles, when your con|&s;titution is revi&s;ed the Rights of Woman may be re&s;pected, if it be fully proved that rea&s;on calls for this re&s;pect, and loudly demands JUSTICE for one half of the human race.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER con&s;idering the hi&s;toric page, and viewing the living world with anxious &s;olici|tude, the mo&s;t melancholy emotions of &s;orrow|ful indignation have depre&s;&s;ed my &s;pirits, and I have &s;ighed when obliged to confe&s;s, that either nature has made a great difference between man and man, or that the civilization which has hitherto taken place in the world has been very partial. I have turned over various books writ|ten on the &s;ubject of education, and patiently ob&s;erved the conduct of parents and the man|agement of &s;chools; but what has been the re|&s;ult?&mdash;a profound conviction that the neglected education of my fellow-creatures is the grand &s;ource of the mi&s;ery I deplore; and that women, in particular, are rendered weak and wretched by a variety of concurring cau&s;es, originating from one ha&s;ty conclu&s;ion. The conduct and manners of women, in fact, evidently prove that their minds are not in a healthy &s;tate; for, like the flowers which are planted in too rich a &s;oil,
<PB N="18" REF="025054_0015_0FCDB54DBA02F3C0">
&s;trength and u&s;efulne&s;s are &s;acrificed to beauty; and the flaunting leaves, after having plea&s;ed a fa&s;tidious eye, fade, di&s;regarded o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the &s;talk, long before the &s;ea&s;on when they ought to have arrived at maturity.&mdash;One cau&s;e of this barren blooming I attribute to a fal&s;e &s;y&s;tem of educa|tion, gathered from the books written on this &s;ubject by men who, con&s;idering females rather as women than human creatures, have been more anxious to make them alluring mi&s;tre&s;&s;es than rational wives; and the under&s;tanding of the &s;ex has been &s;o bubbled by this &s;pecious hom|age, that the civilized women of the pre&s;ent century, with a few exceptions, are only anxious to in&s;pire love, when they ought to cheri&s;h a nobler ambition, and by their abilities and vir|tues exact re&s;pect.</P>
<P>In a treati&s;e, therefore, on female rights and manners, the works which have been particu|larly written for their improvement mu&s;t not be overlooked; e&s;pecially when it is a&s;&s;erted, in di|rect terms, that the minds of women are enfee|bled by fal&s;e refinement; that the books of in|&s;truction, written by men of genius, have had the &s;ame tendency as more frivolous productions; and that, in the true &s;tyle of Mahometani&s;m, they are only con&s;idered as females, and not as a part of the human &s;pecies, when improvable rea|&s;on
<PB N="19" REF="025054_0016_0FCDB5518A04AE98">
is allowed to be the dignified di&s;tinction which rai&s;es men above the brute creation, and puts a natural &s;ceptre in a feeble hand.</P>
<P>Yet, becau&s;e I am a woman, I would not lead my readers to &s;uppo&s;e that I mean violently to agitate the conte&s;ted que&s;tion re&s;pecting the equality or inferiority of the &s;ex; but as the &s;ubject lies in my way, and I cannot pa&s;s it over without &s;ubjecting the main tendency of my rea&s;oning to mi&s;con&s;truction, I &s;hall &s;top a mo|ment to deliver, in a few words, my opinion.&mdash; In the government of the phy&s;ical world it is ob&s;ervable that the female, in general, is inferi|or to the male. The male pur&s;ues, the female yields&mdash;this is the law of nature; and it does not appear to be &s;u&s;pended or abrogated in fa|vour of woman. This phy&s;ical &s;uperiority can|not be denied&mdash;and it is a noble prerogative! But not content with this natural pre-eminence, men endeavour to &s;ink us &s;till lower, merely to render us alluring objects for a moment; and women, intoxicated by the adoration which men, under the influence of their &s;en&s;es, pay them, do not &s;eek to obtain a durable intere&s;t in their hearts, or to become the friends of the fellow creatures who find amu&s;ement in their &s;ociety.</P>
<P>I am aware of an obvious inference:&mdash;from every quarter have I heard exclamations again&s;t
<PB N="20" REF="025054_0017_0FCDB5538C7FD058">
ma&s;culine women; but where are they to be found? If by this appellation men mean to in|veigh again&s;t their ardour in hunting, &s;hooting, and gaming, I &s;hall mo&s;t cordially join in the cry; but if it be again&s;t the imitation of manly virtues, or, more properly &s;peaking, the attain|ment of tho&s;e talents and virtues, the exerci&s;e of which ennobles the human character, and which rai&s;e females in the &s;cale of animal being, when they are comprehen&s;ively termed mankind;&mdash; all tho&s;e who view them with a philo&s;ophical eye mu&s;t, I &s;hould think, wi&s;h with me, that they may every day grow more and more ma&s;|culine.</P>
<P>This di&s;cu&s;&s;ion naturally divides the &s;ubject. I &s;hall fir&s;t con&s;ider women in the grand light of human creatures, who, in common with men, are placed on this earth to unfold their faculties; and afterwards I &s;hall more particularly point out their peculiar de&s;ignation.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h al&s;o to &s;teer clear of an error which many re&s;pectable writers have fallen into; for the in&s;truction which has hither been addre&s;|&s;ed to women, has rather been applicable to <HI>ladies,</HI> if the little indirect advice, that is &s;cat|tered through Sanford and Merton, be except|ed; but, addre&s;&s;ing my &s;ex in a firmer tone, I pay particular attention to tho&s;e in the middle
<PB N="21" REF="025054_0018_0FCDB554942CA088">
cla&s;s, becau&s;e they appear to be in the mo&s;t na|tural &s;tate. Perhaps the &s;eeds of fal&s;e refine|ment, immorality, and vanity, have ever been &s;hed by the great. Weak, artificial beings, rai&s;|ed above the common wants and affections of their race, in a premature unnatural manner, un|dermine the very foundation of virtue, and &s;pread corruption through the whole ma&s;s of &s;ociety! As a cla&s;s of mankind they have the &s;tronge&s;t claim to pity; the education of the rich tends to render them vain and helple&s;s, and the un|folding mind is not &s;trengthened by the prac|tice of tho&s;e duties which dignify the human character.&mdash;They only live to amu&s;e them&s;elves, and by the &s;ame law which in nature invariably produces certain effects, they &s;oon only afford barren amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>But as I purpo&s;e taking a &s;eparate view of the different ranks of &s;ociety, and of the moral cha|racter of women, in each, this hint is, for the pre&s;ent, &s;ufficient; and I have only alluded to the &s;ubject, becau&s;e it appears to me to be the very e&s;&s;ence of an introduction to give a cur&s;ory account of the contents of the work it intro|duces.</P>
<P>My own &s;ex, I hope, will excu&s;e me, if I treat them like rational creatures, in&s;tead of flat|tering
<PB N="22" REF="025054_0019_0FCDB5562C3ED3F8">

<P>IN the pre&s;ent &s;tate of &s;ociety it appears nece&s;|&s;ary to go back to fir&s;t principles in &s;earch of the mo&s;t &s;imple truths, and to di&s;pute with &s;ome prevailing prejudice every inch of ground. To clear my way, I mu&s;t be allowed to a&s;k &s;ome plain que&s;tions, and the an&s;wers will probably appear as unequivocal as the axioms on which rea&s;oning is built; though, when entangled with various motives of action, they are formally con|tradicted, either by the words or conduct of men.</P>
<P>In what does man's pre-eminence over the brute creation con&s;i&s;t? The an&s;wer is as clear as that a half is le&s;s than the whole; in Rea&s;on.</P>

<P>Con&s;equently the perfection of our nature and capability of happine&s;s, mu&s;t be e&s;timated by the degree of rea&s;on, virtue, and knowledge, that di&s;tingui&s;h the individual, and direct the laws which bind &s;ociety: and that from the exerci&s;e of rea&s;on, knowledge and virtue naturally flow, is equally undeniable, if mankind be viewed col|lectively.</P>
<P>The rights and duties of man thus &s;implified, it &s;eems almo&s;t impertinent to attempt to illu&s;|trate truths that appear &s;o incontrovertible; yet &s;uch deeply rooted prejudices have clouded rea|&s;on, and &s;uch &s;purious qualities have a&s;&s;umed the name of virtues, that it is nece&s;&s;ary to pur&s;ue the cour&s;e of rea&s;on as it has been perplexed and in|volved in error, by various adventitious circum|&s;tances, comparing the &s;imple axiom with ca&s;ual deviations.</P>
<P>Men, in general, &s;eem to employ their rea&s;on to ju&s;tify prejudices, which they have imbibed, they cannot trace how, rather than to root them out. The mind mu&s;t be &s;trong that re&s;olutely forms its own principles; for a kind of intel|lectual cowardice prevails which makes many men &s;hrink from the ta&s;k, or only do it by halves.

<P>Society, therefore, as it becomes more enlight|ened, &s;hould be very careful not to e&s;tabli&s;h bod|ies of men who mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be made fooli&s;h or vicious by the very con&s;titution of their profe&s;|&s;ion.</P>
<P>In the infancy of &s;ociety, when men were ju&s;t emerging out of barbari&s;m, chiefs and prie&s;ts, touching the mo&s;t powerful &s;prings of &s;avage conduct, hope and fear, mu&s;t have had unbounded &s;way.

<HEAD>CHAP. II. THE PREVAILING OPINION OF A SEXUAL CHARACTER DISCUSSED.</HEAD>
<P>TO account for, and excu&s;e the tyranny of man, many ingenious arguments have been brought forward to prove, that the two &s;exes, in the acquirement of virtue, ought to aim at at|taining a very different character: or, to &s;peak explicitly, women are not allowed to have &s;uffi|cient &s;trength of mind to acquire what really de|&s;erves the name of virtue. Yet it &s;hould &s;eem, allowing them to have &s;ouls, that there is but one way appointed by Providence to lead <HI>man|kind</HI> to either virtue or happine&s;s.</P>
<P>If then women are not a &s;warm of ephemeron triflers, why &s;hould they be kept in ignorance under the &s;pecious name of innocence? Men complain, and with rea&s;on, of the follies and caprices of our &s;ex, when they do not keenly &s;atirize our head&s;trong pa&s;&s;ions and groveling vi|ces. Behold, I &s;hould an&s;wer, the natural effect of ignorance! The mind will ever be un&s;table that has only prejudices to re&s;t on, and the current will run with de&s;tructive fury when there are no bar|riers to break its force. Women are told from their infancy, and taught by the example of their mothers, that a little knowledge of human weak|ne&s;s, ju&s;tly termed cunning, &s;oftne&s;s of temper, <HI>out ward</HI> obedience, and a &s;crupulous attention

to a puerile kind of propriety, will obtain for them the protection of man; and &s;hould they be beautiful, every thing el&s;e is needle&s;s, for, at lea&s;t, twenty years of their lives.</P>
<P>Thus Milton de&s;cribes our fir&s;t frail mother; though when he tells us that women are formed for &s;oftne&s;s and &s;weet attractive grace, I cannot comprehend his meaning, unle&s;s, in the true Mahometan &s;train, he meant to deprive us of &s;ouls, and in&s;inuate that we were beings only de|&s;igned by &s;weet attractive grace, and docile blind obedience, to gratify the &s;en&s;es of man when he can no longer &s;oar on the wing of contemplation.</P>
<P>How gro&s;sly do they in&s;ult us who thus ad|vi&s;e us only to render our&s;elves gentle, dome&s;tic brutes! For in&s;tance, the winning &s;oftne&s;s &s;o warmly, and frequently, recommended, that gov|erns by obeying. What childi&s;h expre&s;&s;ions, and how in&s;ignificant is the being&mdash;can it be an im|mortal one? who will conde&s;cend to govern by &s;uch &s;ini&s;ter methods! 'Certainly, &s;ays Lord Ba|con,
<Q>man is of kin to the bea&s;ts by his body; and if he be not of kin to God by his &s;pirit, he is a ba&s;e and ignoble creature!</Q>
Men, indeed, appear to me to act in a very unphilo&s;ophical manner when they try to &s;ecure the good conduct of women by attempting to keep them always in a &s;tate of childhood. Rou&s;&s;eau was more con|&s;i&s;tent when he wi&s;hed to &s;top the progre&s;s of rea&s;on in both &s;exes, for if men eat of the tree of knowledge, women will come in for a ta&s;te; but, from the imperfect cultivation which their un|der&s;tandings now receive, they only attain a knowledge of evil.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="025054_0038_0FCDB589BA709628">Children, I grant, &s;hould be innocent; but when the epithet is applied to men, or women, it is but a civil term for weakne&s;s.

Milton, I grant, was of a very differ|ent opinion; for he only bends to the indefea&s;i|ble right of beauty, though it would be difficult to render two pa&s;&s;ages which I now mean to con|tra&s;t, con&s;i&s;tent.

<P>In treating, therefore, of the manners of wo|men, let us, di&s;regarding &s;en&s;ual arguments, trace what we &s;hould endeavour to make them in or|der to co-operate, if the expre&s;&s;ion be not too bold, with the &s;upreme Being.</P>
<P>By individual education, I mean, for the &s;en&s;e of the word is not preci&s;ely defined, &s;uch an at|tention to a child as will &s;lowly &s;harpen the &s;en&s;|es, form the temper, regulate the pa&s;&s;ions, as they begin to ferment, and &s;et the under&s;tanding to work before the body arrives at maturity; &s;o that the man may only have to proceed, not to begin, the important ta&s;k of learning to think and rea&s;on.</P>
<P>To prevent any mi&s;con&s;truction, I mu&s;t add, that I do not believe that a private education can work the wonders which &s;ome &s;anguine writers have attributed to it. Men and women mu&s;t be educated, in a great degree, by the opinions and manners of the &s;ociety they live in. In every age there has been a &s;tream of popular opinion that has carried all before it, and given a family character, as it were, to the century. It may then fairly be inferred, that, till &s;ociety be dif|ferently con&s;tituted, much cannot be expected from education. It is, however, &s;ufficient for
<PB N="43" REF="025054_0040_0FCDB58E0E4970B0">
my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e to a&s;&s;ert, that whatever ef|fect circum&s;tances have on the abilities, every be|ing may become virtuous by the exerci&s;e of its own rea&s;on; for if but one being was created with vicious inclinations, that is po&s;itively had, what can &s;ave us from athei&s;m? or if we wor|&s;hip a God, is not that God a devil?</P>
<P>Con&s;equently, the mo&s;t perfect education, in my opinion, is &s;uch an exerci&s;e of the under|&s;tanding as is be&s;t calculated to &s;trengthen the body and form the heart. Or, in other words, to enable the individual to attain &s;uch habits of virtue as will render it independent. In fact, it is a farce to call any being virtuous who&s;e vir|tues do not re&s;ult from the exerci&s;e of its own rea&s;on. This was Rou&s;&s;eau's opinion re&s;pecting men: I extend it to women, and confidently a&s;|&s;ert that they have been drawn out of their &s;phere by fal&s;e refinement, and not by an endea|vour to acquire ma&s;culine qualities. Still the regal homage which they receive is &s;o intoxicat|ing, that till the manners of the times are chang|ed, and formed on more rea&s;onable principles, it may be impo&s;&s;ible to convince them that the il|legitimate power which they obtain, by degrad|ing them&s;elves, is a cur&s;e, and that they mu&s;t return to nature and equality, if they wi&s;h to &s;e|cure the placid &s;atisfaction that un&s;ophi&s;ticated affections impart. But for this epoch we mu&s;t wait&mdash;wait, perhaps, till kings and nobles, en|lightened by rea&s;on, and, preferring the real dig|nity of man to childi&s;h &s;tate, throw off their gaudy hereditary tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ppings: and if the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> women do not re&s;ign the arbitrary power of beauty&mdash;

they will prove that they have <HI>le&s;s</HI> mind than man.</P>
<P>I may be accu&s;ed of arrogance; &s;till I mu&s;t declare, what I firmly believe, that all the writ|ers who have written on the &s;ubject of female education and manners, from Rou&s;&s;eau to Dr. Gregory, have contributed to render women more artificial, weak characters, than they would otherwi&s;e have been; and, con&s;equently, more u&s;ele&s;s members of &s;ociety, I might have expre&s;|&s;ed this conviction in a lower key; but I am afraid it would have been the whine of affecta|tion, and not the faithful expre&s;&s;ion of my feel|ings; of the clear re&s;ult, which experience and reflection have led me to draw. When I come to that divi&s;ion of the &s;ubject, I &s;hall advert to the pa&s;&s;ages that I more particularly di&s;approve of, in the works of the authors I have ju&s;t allud|ed to; but it is fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that my objection extends to the whole purport of tho&s;e books, which tend, in my opinion, to de|grade one half of the human &s;pecies, and render women plea&s;ing at the expen&s;e of every &s;olid virtue.</P>
<P>Though, to rea&s;on on Rou&s;&s;eau's ground, if man did attain a degree of perfection of mind when his body arrived at maturity, it might be proper, in order to make a man and his wife <HI>one,</HI> that &s;he &s;hould rely entirely on his under&s;tand|ing; and the graceful ivy, cla&s;ping the oak that &s;upported it, would form a whole in which &s;trength and beauty would be equally con&s;picu|ous. But, alas! hu&s;bands, as well as their help|mates, are often only overgrown children; nay,

thanks to early debauchery, &s;carcely men in their outward form&mdash;and if the blind lead the blind, one need not come from heaven to tell us the con&s;equence.</P>
<P>Many are the cau&s;es that, in the pre&s;ent cor|rupt &s;tate of &s;ociety, contribute to en&s;lave women by cramping their under&s;tandings and &s;harpening their &s;en&s;es. One, perhaps, that &s;ilently does more mi&s;chief than all the re&s;t, is their di&s;re|gard of order.</P>
<P>To do every thing in an orderly manner, is a mo&s;t important precept, which women, who, generally &s;peaking, receive only a di&s;orderly kind of education, &s;eldom attend to with that degree of exactne&s;s, that men, who from their infancy are broken into method, ob&s;erve. This negli|gent kind of gue&s;s-work, for what other epithet can be u&s;ed to point out the random exertions of a &s;ort of in&s;tinctive common &s;en&s;e, never brought to the te&s;t of rea&s;on? prevents their generalizing matters of fact&mdash;&s;o they do to-day, what they did ye&s;terday, merely becau&s;e they did it ye&s;ter|day.</P>
<P>This contempt of the under&s;tanding in early life has more baneful con&s;equences than is com|monly &s;uppo&s;ed; for the little knowledge which women of &s;trong minds attain, is, from various circum&s;tances, of a more de&s;ultory kind than the knowledge of men, and it is acquired more by &s;heer ob&s;ervations on real life, than from compar|ing what has been individually ob&s;erved with the re&s;ults of experience generalized by &s;pecula|tion. Led by their dependent &s;ituation and do|me&s;tic employments more into &s;ociety, what they
<PB N="46" REF="025054_0043_0FCDB592C61AD5F0">
learn is rather by &s;natches; and as learning is with them, in general, only a &s;econdary thing, they do not pur&s;ue any one branch with that per&s;evering ardour nece&s;&s;ary to give vigour to the faculties, and clearne&s;s to the judgment. In the pre&s;ent &s;tate of &s;ociety, a little learning is re|quired to &s;upport the character of a gentleman; and boys are obliged to &s;ubmit to a few years of di&s;cipline. But in the education of women, the cultivation of the under&s;tanding is always &s;ubor|dinate to the acquirement of &s;ome corporeal ac|compli&s;hment; even while enervated by confine|ment and fal&s;e notions of mode&s;ty, the body is prevented from attaining that grace and beauty which relaxed half-formed limbs never exhibit. Be&s;ides, in youth their faculties are not brought forward by emulation; and having no &s;erious &s;cientific &s;tudy, if they have natural &s;agacity it is turned too &s;oon on life and manners. They dwell on effects, and modifications, without tracing them back to cau&s;es; and complicated rules to adju&s;t behaviour, are a weak &s;ub&s;titute for &s;im|ple principles.</P>
<P>As a proof that education gives this appear|ance of weakne&s;s to females, we may in&s;tance the example of military men, who are, like them, &s;ent into the world before their minds have been &s;tored with knowledge or fortified by principles. The con&s;equences are &s;imilar; &s;oldiers acquire a little &s;uperficial knowledge, &s;natched from the muddy current of conver&s;ation, and, from conti|nually mixing with &s;ociety, they gain, what is termed a knowledge of the world; and this ac|quaintance with manners and cu&s;toms has fre|quently
<PB N="47" REF="025054_0044_0FCDB594433F9E88">
been confounded with a knowledge of the human heart. But can the crude fruit of ca&s;ual ob&s;ervation, never brought to the te&s;t of judg|ment, formed by comparing &s;peculation and ex|perience, de&s;erve &s;uch a di&s;tinction? Soldiers, as well as women, practi&s;e the minor virtues with punctilious politene&s;s. Where is then the &s;exu|al difference, when the education has been the &s;ame? All the difference that I can di&s;cern, ari&s;es from the &s;uperior advantage of liberty, which en|ables the former to &s;ee more of life.</P>
<P>It is wandering from my pre&s;ent &s;ubject, per|haps, to make a political remark; but, as it was produced naturally by the train of my reflections, I &s;hall not pa&s;s it &s;ilently over.</P>
<P>Standing armies can never con&s;i&s;t of re&s;olute, robu&s;t men; they may be well di&s;ciplined ma|chines, but they will &s;eldom contain men under the influence of &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions, or with very vigorous faculties. And as for any depth of under&s;tand|ing, I will venture to affirm, that it is as rarely to be found in the army as among&s;t women; and the cau&s;e, I maintain, is the &s;ame. It may be further ob&s;erved, that officers are al&s;o particularly attentive to their per&s;ons, fond of dancing, crowd|ed rooms, adventures, and ridicule<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Why &s;hould women be cen&s;ured with petulent acrimony, becau&s;e they &s;eem to have a pa&s;&s;ion for a &s;carlet coat?

<P>The great misfortune is this, that they both acquire manners before morals, and a knowledge of life before they have, from reflection, any ac|quaintance with the grand ideal outline of hu|man nature. The con&s;equence is natural; &s;ati&s;|fied with common nature, they become a prey to prejudices, and taking all their opinions on credit, they blindly &s;ubmit to authority. So that, if they have any &s;en&s;e, it is a kind of in|&s;tinctive glance, that catches proportions, and de|cides with re&s;pect to manners; but fails when arguments are to be pur&s;ued below the &s;urface, or opinions analyzed.</P>
<P>May not the &s;ame remark be applied to wo|men? Nay, the argument may be carried &s;till further, for they are both thrown out of a u&s;e|ful &s;tation by the unnatural di&s;tinctions e&s;tab|li&s;hed in civilized life. Riches and hereditary honours have made cyphers of women to give con&s;equence to the numerical figure; and idle|ne&s;s has produced a mixture of gallantry and de&s;|poti&s;m into &s;ociety, which leads the very men who are the &s;laves of their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es to tyrannize over their &s;i&s;ters, wives, and daughters. This is only keeping them in rank and file, it is true. Strengthen the female mind by enlarging it, and there will be an end to blind obedience; but, as blind obedience is ever &s;ought for by power, ty|rants and &s;en&s;uali&s;ts are in the right when they endeavour to keep women in the dark, becau&s;e the former only want &s;laves, and the latter a play-thing.

<P>I now principally allude to Rou&s;&s;eau, for his character of Sophia is, undoubtedly, a captivating one, though it appears to me gro&s;sly unnatural; however, it is not the &s;uper&s;tructure but the foundation of her character, the principles on which her education was built, that I mean to attack; nay, warmly as I admire the genius of that able writer, who&s;e opinions I &s;hall often have occa&s;ion to cite, indignation always takes place of admiration, and the rigid frown of in|&s;ulted virtue effaces the &s;mile of complacency, which his eloquent periods are wont to rai&s;e, when I read his voluptuous reveries. Is this the man, who, in his ardour for virtue, would bani&s;h all the &s;oft arts of peace, and almo&s;t car|ry us back to Spartan di&s;cipline?

Rou&s;&s;eau de|clares that a woman &s;hould never, for a moment, feel her&s;elf independent, that &s;he &s;hould be gov|erned by fear to exerci&s;e her <HI>natural</HI> cunning, and made a coqueti&s;h &s;lave in order to render her a more alluring object of de&s;ire, a <HI>&s;weeter</HI> compan|ion to man, whenever he choo&s;es to relax him|&s;elf. He carries the arguments, which he pre|tends to draw from the indications of nature, &s;till further, and in&s;inuates that truth and fortitude, the corner &s;tones of all human virtue, &s;hould be cultivated with certain re&s;trictions, becau&s;e, with re&s;pect to the female character, obedience is the grand le&s;&s;on which ought to be impre&s;&s;ed with unrelenting rigour.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="025054_0048_0FCDB59DB2ACDAC8">What non&s;en&s;e! when will a great man ari&s;e with &s;ufficient &s;trength of mind to puff away the fumes which pride and &s;en&s;uality have thus &s;pread over the &s;ubject! If women are by nature inferior to men, their virtues mu&s;t be the &s;ame in quality, if not in degree, or virtue is a relative idea; con&s;equently, their conduct &s;hould be founded on the &s;ame principles, and have the &s;ame aim.</P>
<P>Connected with man as daughters, wives, and mothers, their moral character may be e&s;timated by their manner of fulfilling tho&s;e &s;imple du|ties; but the end, the grand end of their exer|tions &s;hould be to unfold their own faculties and acquire the dignity of con&s;cious virtue. They may try to render their road plea&s;ant; but ought never to forget, in common with man, that life yields not the felicity which can &s;atisfy an im|mortal &s;oul. I do not mean to in&s;inuate, that either &s;ex &s;hould be &s;o lo&s;t in ab&s;tract reflections or di&s;tant views, as to forget the affections and duties that lie before them, and are, in truth, the means appointed to produce the fruit of life; on the contrary, I would warmly recom|mend them, even while I a&s;&s;ert, that they afford mo&s;t &s;atisfaction when they are con&s;idered in their true &s;ubordinate light.</P>
<P>Probably the prevailing opinion, that woman was created for man, may have taken its ri&s;e from Mo&s;es's poetical &s;tory; yet, as very few, it is pre&s;umed, who have be&s;towed any &s;erious thought on the &s;ubject, ever &s;uppo&s;ed that Eve was, literally &s;peaking, one of Adam's ribs, the deduction mu&s;t be allowed to fall to the ground;

or, only be &s;o far admitted as it proves that man, from the remote&s;t antiquity, found it convenient to exert his &s;trength to &s;ubjugate his compan|ion, and his invention to &s;hew that &s;he ought to have her neck bent under the yoke; becau&s;e &s;he, as well as the brute creation, was created to do his plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Let it not be concluded that I wi&s;h to invert the order of things; I have already granted, that, from the con&s;titution of their bodies, men &s;eem to be de&s;igned by Providence to attain a greater degree of virtue. I &s;peak collectively of the whole &s;ex; but I &s;ee not the &s;hadow of a rea|&s;on to conclude that their virtues &s;hould differ in re&s;pect to their nature. In fact, how can they, if virtue has only one eternal &s;tandard? I mu&s;t therefore, if I rea&s;on con&s;equentially, as &s;trenu|ou&s;ly maintain that they have the &s;ame &s;imple di|rection, as that there is a God.</P>
<P>It follows then that cunning &s;hould not be oppo&s;ed to wi&s;dom, little cares to great exertions, nor in&s;ipid &s;oftne&s;s, varni&s;hed over with the name of gentlene&s;s, to that fortitude which grand views alone can in&s;pire.</P>
<P>I &s;hall be told that woman would then lo&s;e many of her peculiar graces, and the opinion of a well known poet might be quoted to refute my unqualified a&s;&s;ertion. For Pope has &s;aid, in the name of the whole male &s;ex,

<P>To &s;peak di&s;re&s;pectfully of love is, I know, high trea&s;on again&s;t &s;entiment and fine feelings; but I wi&s;h to &s;peak the &s;imple language of truth, and rather to addre&s;s the head than the heart. To endeavour to rea&s;on love out of the world, would be to out Quixote Cervantes, and equally offend again&s;t common &s;en&s;e; but an endeavour to re&s;train this tumultuous pa&s;&s;ion, and to prove that it &s;hould not be allowed to dethrone &s;uperior powers, or to u&s;urp the &s;ceptre which the under|&s;tanding &s;hould ever coolly wield, appears le&s;s wild.</P>
<P>Youth is the &s;ea&s;on for love in both &s;exes; but in tho&s;e days of thoughtle&s;s enjoyment pro|vi&s;ion &s;hould be made for the more important years of life, when reflection takes place of &s;en|&s;ation. But Rou&s;&s;eau, and mo&s;t of the male wri|ters who have followed his &s;teps, have warmly inculcated that the whole tendency of female education ought to be directed to one point:&mdash; to render them plea&s;ing.</P>
<P>Let me rea&s;on with the &s;upporters of this opin|ion who have any knowledge of human nature, do they imagine that marriage can eradicate the habitude of life? The woman who has only been taught to plea&s;e will &s;oon find that her charms are oblique &s;unbeams, and that they cannot have much effect on her hu&s;band's heart when they are &s;een every day, when the &s;ummer is pa&s;&s;ed and gone. Will &s;he then have &s;ufficient native energy to

look into her&s;elf for comfort, and cultivate her dormant faculties? or, is it not more rational to expect that &s;he will try to plea&s;e other men; and, in the emotions rai&s;ed by the expectation of new conque&s;ts, endeavour to forget the mortification her love or pride has received? When the hu&s;|band cea&s;es to be a lover&mdash;and the time will in|evitably come, her de&s;ire of plea&s;ing will then grow languid, or become a &s;pring of bitterne&s;s; and love, perhaps, the mo&s;t evane&s;cent of all pa&s;|&s;ions, gives place to jealou&s;y or vanity.</P>
<P>I now &s;peak of women who are re&s;trained by principle or prejudice; &s;uch women, though they would &s;hrink from an intrigue with real abhor|rence, yet, neverthele&s;s, wi&s;h to be convinced by the homage of gallantry that they are cruelly neglected by their hu&s;bands; or, days and weeks are &s;pent in dreaming of the happine&s;s enjoyed by congenial &s;ouls, till the health is undermined and the &s;pirits broken by di&s;content. How then can the great art of plea&s;ing be &s;uch a ne|ce&s;&s;ary &s;tudy; it is only u&s;eful to a mi&s;tre&s;s; the cha&s;te wife, and &s;erious mother, &s;hould only con|&s;ider her power to plea&s;e as the poli&s;h of her vir|tues, and the affection of her hu&s;band as one of the comforts that render her ta&s;k le&s;s difficult and her life happier.&mdash;But, whether &s;he be loved or neglected, her fir&s;t wi&s;h &s;hould be to make her|&s;elf re&s;pectable, and not to rely for all her happi|ne&s;s on a being &s;ubject to like infirmities with her&s;elf.</P>
<P>The amiable Dr. Gregory fell into a &s;imilar error. I re&s;pect his heart; but entirely di&s;ap|prove of his celebrated Legacy to his Daugh|ters.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="025054_0052_0FCDB5A8146E3598">He advi&s;es them to cultivate a fon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eis for dre&s;s, becau&s;e a fondne&s;s for dre&s;s, he a&s;&s;erts, is natural to them.

If they told us that in a pre-exi&s;tent &s;tate the &s;oul was fond of dre&s;s, and brought this inclination with it into a new body, I &s;hould li&s;ten to them with a half &s;mile, as I often do when I hear a rant about in|nate elegance.&mdash;But if he only meant to &s;ay that the exerci&s;e of the faculties will produce this fondne&s;s&mdash;I deny it.&mdash;It is not natural; but ari|&s;es, like fal&s;e ambition in men, from a love of power.</P>
<P>Dr. Gregory goes much further; he actually recommends di&s;&s;imulation, and advi&s;es an inno|cent girl to give the lie to her feelings, and not dance with &s;pirit, when gaiety of heart would make her feet eloquent without making her ge&s;|tures immode&s;t. In the name of truth and com|mon &s;en&s;e, why &s;hould not one woman acknow|ledge that &s;he can take more exerci&s;e than anoth|er? or, in other words, that &s;he has a &s;ound con|&s;titution; and why, to damp innocent vivacity, is &s;he darkly to be told that men will draw con|clu&s;ions which &s;he little thinks of? Let the lib|ertine draw what inference he plea&s;es; but, I hope, that no &s;en&s;ible mother will re&s;train the natural frankne&s;s of youth by in&s;tilling &s;uch in|decent cautions. Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth &s;peaketh; and a wi&s;er than Solo|mon hath &s;aid, that the heart &s;hould be made clean, and not trivial ceremonies ob&s;erved, which

it is not very difficult to fulfil with &s;crupulous ex|actne&s;s when vice reigns in the heart.</P>
<P>Women ought to endeavour to purify their heart; but can they do &s;o when their uncultiva|ted under&s;tandings make them entirely dependent on their &s;en&s;es for employment and amu&s;ement, when no noble pur&s;uit &s;ets them above the little vanities of the day, or enables them to curb the wild emotions that agitate a reed over which eve|ry pa&s;&s;ing breeze has power? To gain the affec|tions of a virtuous man is affectation nece&s;&s;ary? Nature has given woman a weaker frame than man; but, to en&s;ure her hu&s;band's affections, mu&s;t a wife, who by the exerci&s;e of her mind and body whil&s;t &s;he was di&s;charging the duties of a daughter, wife, and mother, has allowed her con&s;titution to retain its natural &s;trength, and her nerves a healthy tone, is &s;he, I &s;ay, to conde&s;cend to u&s;e art and feign a &s;ickly delicacy in order to &s;ecure her hu&s;band's affection? Weakne&s;s may excite tenderne&s;s, and gratify the arrogant pride of man; but the lordly care&s;&s;es of a protector will not gratify a noble mind that pants for, and de&s;erves to be re&s;pected. Fondne&s;s is a poor &s;ub&s;titute for friend&s;hip!</P>
<P>In a &s;eraglio, I grant, that all the&s;e arts are nece&s;&s;ary; the epicure mu&s;t have his palate tickled, or he will &s;ink into apathy; but have women &s;o little ambition as to be &s;atisfied with &s;uch a con|dition? Can they &s;upinely dream life away in the lap of plea&s;ure, or the languor of wearine&s;s, rather than a&s;&s;ert their claim to pur&s;ue rea&s;onable plea|&s;ures and render them&s;elves con&s;picuous by prac|ti&s;ing the virtues which dignify mankind?

<P>Be&s;ides, the woman who &s;trengthens her body and exerci&s;es her mind will, by managing her fa|mily and practi&s;ing various virtues, become the friend, and not the humble dependent of her hu&s;|band, and if &s;he de&s;erves his regard by po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;uch &s;ub&s;tantial qualities, &s;he will not find it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to conceal her affection, nor to pretend to an unnatural coldne&s;s of con&s;titution to excite her hu&s;band's pa&s;&s;ions.

<P>Nature, or, to &s;peak with &s;trict propriety, God, has made all things right; but man has &s;ought him out many inventions to mar the work. I now allude to that part of Dr. Gregory's treati&s;e, where he advi&s;es a wife never to let her hu&s;band know the extent of her &s;en&s;ibility or affection. Voluptuous precaution, and as ineffectual as ab|&s;urd.&mdash;Love, from its very nature, mu&s;t be tran|&s;itory. To &s;eek for a &s;ecret that would render it con&s;tant, would be as wild a &s;earch as for the philo&s;opher's &s;tone, or the grand panacea: and the di&s;covery would be equally u&s;ele&s;s, or rather pernicious, to mankind. The mo&s;t holy band of &s;ociety is friend&s;hip. It has been well &s;aid, by a &s;hrewd &s;atiri&s;t, "that rare as true love is, true friend&s;hip is &s;till rarer."</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="025054_0055_0FCDB5AC78C854C8">This is an obvious truth, and the cau&s;e not lying deep, will not elude a &s;light glance of in|quiry.</P>
<P>Love, the common pa&s;&s;ion, in which chance and &s;en&s;ation take place of choice and rea&s;on, is, in &s;ome degree, felt by the ma&s;s of mankind; for it is not nece&s;&s;ary to &s;peak, at pre&s;ent, of the emo|tions that ri&s;e above or &s;ink below love. This pa&s;&s;ion, naturally increa&s;ed by &s;u&s;pen&s;e and diffi|culties, draws the mind out of its accu&s;tomed &s;tate, and exalts the affections; but the &s;ecurity of marriage, allowing the fever of love to &s;ub&s;ide, a healthy temperature is thought in&s;ipid, only by tho&s;e who have not &s;ufficient intellect to &s;ub&s;ti|tute the calm tenderne&s;s of friend&s;hip, the confi|dence of re&s;pect, in&s;tead of blind admiration, and the &s;en&s;ual emotions of fondne&s;s.</P>
<P>This is, mu&s;t be, the cour&s;e of nature:&mdash; friend&s;hip or indifference inevitably &s;ucceeds love. &mdash;And this con&s;titution &s;eems perfectly to har|monize with the &s;y&s;tem of government which prevails in the moral world. Pa&s;&s;ions are &s;purs to action, and open the mind; but they &s;ink into mere appetites, become a per&s;onal and momenta|ry gratification, when the object is gained, and the &s;atisfied mind re&s;ts in enjoyment. The man who had &s;ome virtue whil&s;t he was &s;truggling for a crown, often becomes a voluptuous tyrant when it graces his brow; and, when the lover is not lo&s;t in the hu&s;band, the dotard, a prey to childi&s;h caprices, and fond jealou&s;ies, neglects the &s;erious duties of life, and the care&s;&s;es which &s;hould excite confidence in his children are lavi&s;hed on the overgrown child, his wife.</P>

I mean to &s;ay, that they ought not to indulge tho&s;e emotions which di&s;turb the order of &s;ociety, and engro&s;s the thoughts that &s;hould be otherwi&s;e employed.

I will go &s;till further, and advance, without dreaming of a paradox, that an unhappy marriage is often very advantageous to a family, and that the neglected wife is, in general, the be&s;t mother. And this would almo&s;t always be the con&s;equence if the female mind was more en|larged: for, it &s;eems to be the common di&s;pen|&s;ation of Providence, that what we gain in pre|&s;ent enjoyment &s;hould be deducted from the trea|&s;ure of life, experience; and that when we are gathering the flowers of the day and revelling in plea&s;ure, the &s;olid fruit of toil and wi&s;dom &s;hould not be caught at the &s;ame time.

<P>Noble morality! and con&s;i&s;tent with the cau|tious prudence of a little &s;oul that cannot extend its views beyond the pre&s;ent minute divi&s;ion of exi&s;tence.

Gentlene&s;s, con&s;idered in this point of view, bears on its front all the characteri&s;tics of grandeur, combined with the winning graces of conde&s;cen&s;ion; but what a different a&s;pect it a&s;&s;umes when it is the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive demeanour of dependence, the &s;upport of weakne&s;s that loves, becau&s;e it wants protec|tion; and is forbearing, becau&s;e it mu&s;t &s;ilently endure injuries; &s;miling under the la&s;h at which it dare not &s;narl.

<P>How women are to exi&s;t in that &s;tate where there is to be neither marrying nor giving in marriage, we are not told.&mdash;For though moral|i&s;ts have agreed that the tenor of life &s;eems to prove that <HI>man</HI> is prepared by various circum|&s;tances for a future &s;tate, they con&s;tantly concur in advi&s;ing <HI>woman</HI> only to provide for the pre|&s;ent. Gentlene&s;s, docility, and a &s;paniel-like af|fection are, on this ground, con&s;i&s;tently recom|mended as the cardinal virtues of the &s;ex; and, di&s;regarding the arbitrary economy of nature, one writer has declared that it is ma&s;culine for a wo|man to be melancholy. She was created to be the toy of man, his rattle, and it mu&s;t jingle in his ears whenever, di&s;mi&s;&s;ing rea&s;on, he choo&s;es to be amu&s;ed.</P>
<P>To recommend gentlene&s;s, indeed, on a broad ba&s;is is &s;trictly philo&s;ophical. A frail being &s;hould labour to be gentle. But when forbear|ance confounds right and wrong, it cea&s;es to be a virtue; and, however convenient it may be found in a companion&mdash;that companion will ever be con&s;idered as an inferior, and only in&s;pire a vapid tenderne&s;s, which ea&s;ily degenerates into contempt. Still, if advice could really make a being gentle, who&s;e natural di&s;po&s;ition admitted not of &s;uch a fine poli&s;h, &s;omething towards the advancement of order would be attained; but if, as might quickly be demon&s;trated, only affecta|tion be produced by this indi&s;criminate coun&s;el, which throws a &s;tumbling-block in the way of

gradual improvement, and true melioration of temper, the &s;ex is not much benefited by &s;acri|ficing &s;olid virtues to the attainment of &s;uperficial graces, though for a few years they may procure the individuals regal &s;way.</P>
<P>As a philo&s;opher, I read with indignation the plau&s;ible epithets which men u&s;e to &s;often their in|&s;ults; and, as a morali&s;t, I a&s;k what is meant by &s;uch heterogeneous a&s;&s;ociations, as fair defects, amiable weakne&s;&s;es, &amp;c.? If there is but one criterion of morals, but one archetype for man, women appear to be &s;u&s;pended by de&s;tiny, according to the vulgar tale of Mahomet's coffin; they have neither the unerring in&s;tinct of brutes, nor are allowed to fix the eye of rea&s;on on a perfect model. They were made to be loved, and mu&s;t not aim at re&s;pect, le&s;t they &s;hould be hunted out of &s;ociety as ma&s;culine.</P>
<P>But to view the &s;ubject in another point of view. Do pa&s;&s;ive indolent women make the be&s;t wives? Confining our di&s;cu&s;&s;ion to the pre&s;ent mo|ment of exi&s;tence, let us &s;ee how &s;uch weak creatures perform their part? Do the women, who, by the attainment of a few &s;uperficial ac|compli&s;hments, have &s;trengthened the prevailing prejudice, merely contribute to the happine&s;s of their hu&s;bands <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Do they di&s;play their charms merely to amu&s;e them? And have women, who have early imbibed notions of pa&s;&s;ive obedience, &s;ufficient character to manage a family or educate children? So far from it, that, after &s;urveying the hi&s;tory of woman, I cannot help agreeing with the &s;evere&s;t &s;atiri&s;t, con&s;idering the &s;ex as the weake&s;t as well as the mo&s;t oppre&s;&s;ed half of the &s;pecies.

In the fame &s;tyle I have been led to imagine that the few extraordinary women who have ru&s;hed in ec|centrical directions out of the orbit pre&s;cribed to their &s;ex, were <HI>male</HI> &s;pirited, confined by mi&s;take in a female frame. But if it be not philo&s;ophi|cal to think of &s;ex when the &s;oul is mentioned, the inferiority mu&s;t depend on the organs; or the heavenly fire, which is to ferment the clay, is not given in equal portions.</P>
<P>But avoiding, as I have hitherto done, any di|rect compari&s;on of the two &s;exes collectively, or frankly acknowledging the inferiority of woman, according to the pre&s;ent appearance of things, I &s;hall only in&s;i&s;t that men have increa&s;ed that in|feriority till women are almo&s;t &s;unk below the &s;tandard of rational creatures. Let their faculties have room to unfold, and their virtues to gain &s;trength, and then determine where the whole &s;ex mu&s;t &s;tand in the intellectual &s;cale. Yet let it be remembered, that for a &s;mall number of di&s;tingui&s;hed women I do not a&s;k a place.</P>
<P>It is difficult for us purblind mortals to &s;ay to what height human di&s;coveries and improvements may arrive when the gloom of de&s;poti&s;m &s;ub|&s;ides, which makes us &s;tumble at every &s;tep; but, when morality &s;hall be &s;ettled on a more &s;olid ba|&s;is, then, without being gifted with a prophetic &s;pirit, I will venture to predict that woman will

be either the friend or &s;lave of man. We &s;hall not, as at pre&s;ent, doubt whether &s;he is a moral agent, or the link which unites man with brutes. But, &s;hould it then appear, that like the brutes they were principally created for the u&s;e of man, he will let them patiently bite the bridle, and not mock them with empty prai&s;e; or, &s;hould their rationality be proved, he will not impede their improvement merely to gratify his &s;en&s;ual appetites. He will not, with all the graces of rhetoric, advi&s;e them to &s;ubmit implicitly their under&s;tanding to the guidance of man. He will not, when he treats of the education of women, a&s;&s;ert that they ought never to have the free u&s;e of rea&s;on, nor would he recommend cunning and di&s;&s;imulation to beings who are acquiring, in like manner as him&s;elf, the virtues of humanity.</P>
<P>Surely there can be but one rule of right, if morality has an eternal foundation, and whoever &s;acrifices virtue, &s;trictly &s;o called, to pre&s;ent con|venience, or who&s;e <HI>duty</HI> it is to act in &s;uch a manner, lives only for the pa&s;&s;ing day, and can|not be an accountable creature.</P>

<P>If, I &s;ay, for I would not impre&s;s by declama|tion when Rea&s;on offers her &s;ober light, if they are really capable of acting like rational creatures, let them not be treated like &s;laves; or, like the brutes who are dependent on the rea&s;on of man, when they a&s;&s;ociate with him; but cultivate their minds, give them the &s;alutary, &s;ublime curb of principle, and let them attain con&s;cious dignity by feeling them&s;elves only dependent on God. Teach them, in common with man, to &s;ubmit to nece&s;&s;ity, in&s;tead of giving, to render them more plea&s;ing, a &s;ex to morals.</P>
<P>Further, &s;hould experience prove that they cannot attain the &s;ame degree of &s;trength of mind, per&s;everence, and fortitude, let their virtues be the &s;ame in kind, though they may vainly &s;trug|gle for the &s;ame degree; and the &s;uperiority of man will be equally clear, if not clearer; and truth, as it is a &s;imple principle, which admits of no modification, would be common to both. Nay, the order of &s;ociety as it is at pre&s;ent regu|lated would not be inverted, for woman would then only have the rank that rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned her, and arts could not be practi&s;ed to bring the bal|ance even, much le&s;s to turn it.</P>
<P>The&s;e may be termed Utopian dreams.&mdash; Thanks to that Being who impre&s;&s;ed them on my &s;oul, and gave me &s;ufficient &s;trength of mind to dare to exert my own rea&s;on, till, becoming

dependent only on him for the &s;upport of my virtue, I view, with indignation, the mi&s;taken notions that en&s;lave my &s;ex.</P>
<P>I love man as my fellow; but his &s;cepter, real, or u&s;urped, extends not to me, unle&s;s the rea&s;on of an individual demands my homage; and even then the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion is to rea&s;on, and not to man. In fact, the conduct of an account|able being mu&s;t be regulated by the operations of its own rea&s;on; or on what foundation re&s;ts the throne of God?</P>
<P>It appears to me nece&s;&s;ary to dwell on the&s;e obvious truths, becau&s;e females have been in&s;ula|ted, as it were; and, while they have been &s;trip|ped of the virtues that &s;hould clothe humanity, they have been decked with artificial graces that enable them to exerci&s;e a &s;hort-lived tyranny. Love, in their bo&s;oms, taking place of every no|bler pa&s;&s;ion, their &s;ole ambition is to be fair, to rai&s;e emotion in&s;tead of in&s;piring re&s;pect; and this ignoble de&s;ire, like the &s;ervility in ab&s;olute monarchies, de&s;troys all &s;trength of character. Liberty is the mother of virtue, and if women are, by their very con&s;titution, &s;laves, and not al|lowed to breathe the &s;harp invigorating air of freedom, they mu&s;t ever langui&s;h like exotics, and be reckoned beautiful flaws in nature;&mdash;let it al&s;o be remembered, that they are the only flaw.</P>
<P>As to the argument re&s;pecting the &s;ubjection in which the &s;ex has ever been held, it retorts on man.

<P>People of genius have, very frequently, im|paired their con&s;titutions by &s;tudy or carele&s;s in|attention to their health, and the violence of their pa&s;&s;ions bearing a proportion to the vigour of their intellects, the &s;word's de&s;troying the &s;cab|bard has become almo&s;t proverbial, and &s;uper|ficial ob&s;ervers have inferred from thence, that men of genius have commonly weak, or, to u&s;e a more fa&s;hionable phra&s;e, delicate con&s;titutions. Yet the contrary, I believe, will appear to be the fact; for, on diligent inquiry, I find that &s;trength of mind has, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, been accom|panied by &s;uperior &s;trength of body,&mdash;natural &s;oundne&s;s of con&s;titution,&mdash;not that robu&s;t tone

<P>Dr. Prie&s;tley has remarked, in the preface to his biographical chart, that the majority of great men have lived beyond forty-five. And, con&s;id|ering the thoughtle&s;s manner in which they have lavi&s;hed their &s;trength, when inve&s;tigating a fa|vourite &s;cience they have wa&s;ted the lamp of life, forgetful of the midnight hour; or, when lo&s;t in poetic dreams, fancy has peopled the &s;cene, and the &s;oul has been di&s;turbed, till it &s;hook the con|&s;titution, by the pa&s;&s;ions that meditation had rai&s;|ed; who&s;e objects, the ba&s;ele&s;s fabric of a vi&s;ion, faded before the exhau&s;ted eye, they mu&s;t have had iron frames.

<P>I am aware that this argument would carry me further than it may be &s;uppo&s;ed I wi&s;h to go; but I follow truth, and, &s;till adhering to my fir&s;t po&s;ition, I will allow that bodily &s;trength &s;eems to give man a natural &s;uperiority over wo|man; and this is the only &s;olid ba&s;is on which the &s;uperiority of the &s;ex can be built.

All the ideas of women, which have not the immediate tenden|cy to points of duty, &s;hould be directed to the &s;tudy of men, and to the attainment of tho&s;e agreeable accompli&s;hments which have ta&s;te for their object; for as to works of genius, they are beyond their capaci|ty; neither have they &s;ufficient preci&s;ion or power of attention to &s;uc|ceed in &s;ciences which require accuracy: and as to phy&s;ical know|ledge, it belongs to tho&s;e only who are mo&s;t active, mo&s;t inqui&s;itive; who comprehend the greate&s;t variety of objects: in &s;hort, it belongs to tho&s;e who have the &s;tronge&s;t powers, and who exerci&s;e them mo&s;t, to judge of the relations between &s;en&s;ible beings and the laws of nature. A woman who is naturally weak, and does not carry her ideas to any great extent, knows how to judge and make a proper e&s;timate of tho&s;e movements which &s;he &s;ets to work, in order to aid her weak|ne&s;s; and the&s;e movements are the pa&s;&s;ions of men. The mechani&s;m &s;he employs is much more powerful than ours; for all her levers move the human heart. She mu&s;t have the &s;kill to incline us to do every thing which her &s;ex will not enable her to do of her&s;elf, and which is nece&s;&s;ary or agreeable to her; therefore &s;he ought to &s;tudy the mind of man thoroughly, not the mind of man in general, ab|&s;tracted, but the di&s;po&s;itions of tho&s;e men to whom &s;he is &s;ubject, either by the laws of her country or by the force of opinion. She &s;hould learn to penetrate into their real &s;entiments from their conver&s;ation, their actions, their looks, and ge&s;tures. She &s;hould al&s;o have the art, by her own conver&s;ation, actions, looks, and ge&s;tures, to communi|cate tho&s;e &s;entiments which are agreeable to them, without &s;eeming to intend it. Men will argue more philo&s;ophically about the human heart; but women will read the heart of man better than they. It belongs to women, if I may be allowed the expre&s;&s;ion, to form an ex|perimental morality, and to reduce the &s;tudy of man to a &s;y&s;tem. Women have mo&s;t wit, men have mo&s;t genius; women ob&s;erve, men rea&s;on: from the concurrence of both we derive the cleare&s;t light and the mo&s;t perfect knowledge, which the human mind is, of it&s;elf, capa|ble of attaining. In one word, from hence we acquire the mo&s;t in|timate acquaintance, both with our&s;elves and others, of which our na|ture is capable; and it is thus that art has a con&s;tant tendency to perfect tho&s;e endowments which nature has be&s;towed.&mdash;The world is the book of women.</Q>

As &s;oon as &s;he was &s;ufficiently advanced in &s;trength to be capable of the lighter labours of hu&s;bandry and gar|dening, I employed her as my con&s;tant companion.

If women are in general feeble both in body and mind, it ari&s;es le&s;s from nature than from education. We encourage a vicious indolence and inactivity, which we fal&s;ely call delicacy; in&s;tead of hardening their minds by the &s;everer principles of rea&s;on and philo&s;ophy, we breed them to u&s;ele&s;s arts, which terminate in vanity and &s;en&s;uality. In mo&s;t of the countries which I had vi&s;ited, they are taught nothing of an higher nature than a few modulations of the voice, or u&s;ele&s;s po&s;|tures of the body; their time is con&s;umed in &s;loth or trifles, and tri|fles become the only pur&s;uits capable of intere&s;ting them.

&s;trengthen her con&s;titution and ab&s;tain from en|ervating indulgencies, if artificial notions of beau|ty, and fal&s;e de&s;criptions of &s;en&s;ibility, have been early entangled with her motives of action.

<P>I once knew a weak woman of fa&s;hion, who was more than commonly proud of her delicacy and &s;en&s;ibility. She thought a di&s;tingui&s;hing ta&s;te and puny appetite the height of all human perfection, and acted accordingly.&mdash;I have &s;een this weak &s;ophi&s;ticated being neglect all the du|ties of life, yet recline with &s;elf-complacency on a &s;ofa, and boa&s;t of her want of appetite as a proof of delicacy that extended to, or, perhaps, aro&s;e from, her exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility: for it is diffi|cult to render intelligible &s;uch ridiculous jargon. &mdash;Yet, at the moment, I have &s;een her in&s;ult a worthy old gentlewoman, whom unexpected misfortunes had made dependent on her o&s;tenta|tious bounty, and who, in better days, had claims on her gratitude. Is it po&s;&s;ible that a human creature could have become &s;uch a weak and de|praved being, if, like the Sybarites, di&s;&s;olved in luxury, every thing like virtue had not been worn away, or never impre&s;&s;ed by precept, a poor &s;ub|&s;titute, it is true, for cultivation of mind, though it &s;erves as a fence again&s;t vice?</P>
<P>Such a woman is not a more irrational mon|&s;ter than &s;ome of the Roman emperors, who were depraved by lawle&s;s power. Yet, &s;ince
<PB N="81" REF="025054_0078_0FCDB5E1D898AD38">
kings have been more under the re&s;traint of law, and the curb, however weak, of honour, the re|cords of hi&s;tory are not filled with &s;uch unnatu|ral in&s;tances of folly and cruelty, nor does the de&s;poti&s;m that kills virtue and genius in the bud, hover over Europe with that de&s;tructive bla&s;t which de&s;olates Turky, and renders the men, as well as the &s;oil, unfruitful.</P>
<P>Women are every where in this deplorable &s;tate; for, in order to pre&s;erve their innocence, as ignorance is courteou&s;ly termed, truth is hidden from them, and they are made to a&s;&s;ume an arti|ficial character before their faculties have acquired any &s;trength. Taught from their infancy that beauty is woman's &s;ceptre, the mind &s;hapes it&s;elf to the body, and, roaming round its gilt cage, only &s;eeks to adorn its pri&s;on. Men have various employments and pur&s;uits which engage their at|tention, and give a character to the opening mind; but women, confined to one, and having their thoughts con&s;tantly directed to the mo&s;t in|&s;ignificant part of them&s;elves, &s;eldom extend their views beyond the triumph of the hour. But was their under&s;tanding once emancipated from the &s;lavery to which the pride and &s;en&s;uality of man and their &s;hort-&s;ighted de&s;ire, like that of dominion in tyrants, of pre&s;ent &s;way, has &s;ubjected them, we &s;hould probably read of their weakne&s;&s;es with &s;urpri&s;e. I mu&s;t be allowed to pur&s;ue the ar|gument a little farther.</P>
<P>Perhaps, if the exi&s;tence of an evil being was allowed, who, in the allegorical language of &s;crip|ture, went about &s;eeking whom he &s;hould devour, he could not more effectually degrade the human

character than by giving a man ab&s;olute pow|er.</P>
<P>This argument branches into various ramifica|tions.&mdash;Birth, riches, and every extrin&s;ic advan|tage that exalt a man above his fellows, without any mental exertion, &s;ink him in reality below them. In proportion to his weakne&s;s, he is played upon by de&s;igning men, till the bloated mon&s;ter has lo&s;t all traces of humanity. And that tribes of men, like flocks of &s;heep, &s;hould quietly follow &s;uch a leader, is a &s;oleci&s;m that only a de&s;ire of pre&s;ent enjoyment and narrow|ne&s;s of under&s;tanding can &s;olve. Educated in &s;lavi&s;h dependence, and enervated by luxury and &s;loth, where &s;hall we find men who will &s;tand forth to a&s;&s;ert the rights of man;&mdash;or claim the privilege of moral beings, who &s;hould have but one road to excellence? Slavery to monarchs and mini&s;ters, which the world will be long in freeing it&s;elf from, and who&s;e deadly gra&s;p &s;top the progre&s;s of the human mind, is not yet aboli&s;hed.</P>
<P>Let not men then in the pride of power, u&s;e the &s;ame arguments that tyrannic kings and venal mini&s;ters have u&s;ed, and fallaciou&s;ly a&s;&s;ert that woman ought to be &s;ubjected becau&s;e &s;he has always been &s;o.&mdash;But, when man, governed by rea&s;onable laws, enjoys his natural freedom, let him de&s;pi&s;e woman, if &s;he do not &s;hare it with him; and till that glorious period arrives, in de|&s;canting on the folly of the &s;ex, let him not over|look his own.</P>
<P>Women, it is true, obtaining power by unju&s;t means, by practi&s;ing or fo&s;tering vice, evidently lo&s;e the rank which rea&s;on would a&s;&s;ign them, and they
<PB N="83" REF="025054_0080_0FCDB5E557764D48">
become either abject &s;laves or capricious tyrants. They lo&s;e all &s;implicity, all dignity of mind, in acquiring power, and act as men are ob&s;erved to act when they have been exalted by the &s;ame means.</P>
<P>It is time to effect a revolution in female man|ners&mdash;time to re&s;tore to them their lo&s;t dignity&mdash; and make them, as a part of the human &s;pecies, labour by reforming them&s;elves to reform the world. It is time to &s;eparate unchangeable mor|als from local manners.&mdash;If men be demi-gods&mdash; why let us &s;erve them! And if the dignity of the female &s;oul be as di&s;putable as that of animals&mdash; if their rea&s;on does not afford &s;ufficient light to direct their conduct whil&s;t unerring in&s;tinct is denied&mdash;they are &s;urely of all creatures the mo&s;t mi&s;erable! and, bent beneath the iron hand of de&s;tiny, mu&s;t &s;ubmit to be a <HI>fair defect</HI> in crea|tion. But to ju&s;tify the ways of Providence re|&s;pecting them, by pointing out &s;ome irrefragable rea&s;on for thus making &s;uch a large portion of mankind accountable and not accountable, would puzzle the &s;ubtile&s;t ca&s;ui&s;t.</P>
<P>The only &s;olid foundation for morality appears to be the character of the &s;upreme Being; the harmony of which ari&s;es from a balance of attri|butes;&mdash;and, to &s;peak with reverence, one attri|bute &s;eems to imply the <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of another. He mu&s;t be ju&s;t, becau&s;e he is wi&s;e, he mu&s;t be good, becau&s;e he is omnipotent. For to exalt one at|tribute at the expen&s;e of another equally noble and nece&s;&s;ary, bears the &s;tamp of the warped rea|&s;on of man&mdash;the homage of pa&s;&s;ion. Man, ac|cu&s;tomed to bow down to power in his &s;avage

&s;tate, can &s;eldom dive&s;t him&s;elf of this barbarous prejudice, even when civilization determines how much &s;uperior mental is to bodily &s;trength; and his rea&s;on is clouded by the&s;e crude opinions, even when he thinks of the Deity. His omnip|otence is made to &s;wallow up, or pre&s;ide over his other attributes, and tho&s;e mortals are &s;uppo&s;ed to limit his power irreverently, who think that it mu&s;t be regulated by his wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>I di&s;claim that &s;pecious humility which, after inve&s;tigating nature, &s;tops at the author.&mdash;The High and Lofty One, who inhabiteth eternity, doubtle&s;s po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es many attributes of which we can form no conception; but rea&s;on tells me that they cannot cla&s;h with tho&s;e I adore&mdash;and I am compelled to li&s;ten to her voice.</P>
<P>It &s;eems natural for man to &s;earch for excel|lence, and either to trace it in the object that he wor&s;hips, or blindly to inve&s;t it with perfection, as a garment. But what good effect can the latter mode of wor&s;hip have on the moral con|duct of a rational being? He bends to power; he adores a dark cloud, which may open a bright pro&s;pect to him, or bur&s;t in angry, lawle&s;s fury, on his devoted head&mdash;he knows not why. And, &s;uppo&s;ing that the Deity acts from the vague im|pul&s;e of an undirected will, man mu&s;t al&s;o follow his own, or act according to rules, deduced from principles which he disclaims as irreverent. In|to this dilemma have both enthu&s;ia&s;ts and cooler thinkers fallen, when they laboured to free men from the whole&s;ome re&s;traints which a ju&s;t con|ception of the character of God impo&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="025054_0082_0FCDB5EA278825D0">It is not impious thus to &s;can the attributes of the Almighty: in fact, who can avoid it that exerci&s;es his faculties? For to love God as the fountain of wi&s;dom, goodne&s;s, and power, ap|pears to be the only wor&s;hip u&s;eful to a being who wi&s;hes to acquire either virtue or know|ledge. A blind un&s;ettled affection may, like hu|man pa&s;&s;ions, occupy the mind and warm the heart, whil&s;t, to do ju&s;tice, love mercy, and walk humbly with our God, is forgotten. I &s;hall pur&s;ue this &s;ubject &s;till further, when I con&s;ider religion in a light oppo&s;ite to that recommended by Dr. Gregory, who treats it as a matter of &s;en|timent or ta&s;te.</P>
<P>To return from this apparent digre&s;&s;ion.

No other firm ba&s;e is there under heaven&mdash;for let them beware of the fallacious light of &s;entiment; too often u&s;ed as a &s;ofter phra&s;e for &s;en&s;uality.

<P>Why do men halt between two opinions, and expect impo&s;&s;ibilities? Why do they expect vir|tue from a &s;lave, from a being whom the con&s;ti|tution of civil &s;ociety has rendered weak, if not vicious?</P>
<P>Still I know that it will require a con&s;iderable length of time to eradicate the firmly rooted pre|judices which &s;en&s;uali&s;ts have planted; it will al&s;o require &s;ome time to convince women that

they act contrary to their real intere&s;t on an en|larged &s;cale, when they cheri&s;h or affect weak|ne&s;s under the name of delicacy, and to convince the world that the poi&s;oned &s;ource of female vices and follies, if it be nece&s;&s;ary, in compliance with cu&s;tom, to u&s;e &s;ynonymous terms in a lax &s;en&s;e, has been the &s;en&s;ual homage paid to beauty:&mdash;to beauty of features; for it has been &s;hrewdly ob|&s;erved by a German writer, that a pretty woman, as an object of de&s;ire, is generally allowed to be &s;o by men of all de&s;criptions; whil&s;t a fine wo|man, who in&s;pires more &s;ublime emotions by di&s;|playing intellectual beauty, may be overlooked or ob&s;erved with indifference, by tho&s;e men who find their happine&s;s in the gratification of their appetites. I fore&s;ee an obvious retort&mdash;whil&s;t man remains &s;uch an imperfect being as he ap|pears hitherto to have been, he will, more or le&s;s, be the &s;lave of his appetites; and tho&s;e women obtaining mo&s;t power who gratify a predominant one, the &s;ex is degraded by a phy&s;ical, if not by a moral nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>This objection has, I grant, &s;ome force; but while &s;uch a &s;ublime precept exi&s;ts, as, 'be pure as your heavenly Father is pure;' it would &s;eem that the virtues of man are not limited by the Be|ing who alone could limit them; and that he may pre&s;s forward without con&s;idering whether he &s;teps out of his &s;phere by indulging &s;uch a noble ambition.

their orbits, matter yields to the great governing Spirit.&mdash;But an immortal &s;oul, not re&s;trained by mechanical laws and &s;truggling to free it&s;elf from the &s;hackles of matter, contributes to, in&s;tead of di&s;turbing, the order of creation, when, co-op|erating with the Father of &s;pirits, it tries to gov|ern it&s;elf by the invariable rule that, in a degree, before which our imagination faints, the univer&s;e is regulated.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, if women are educated for depend|ence; that is, to act according to the will of an|other fallible being, and &s;ubmit, right or wrong, to power, where are we to &s;top? Are they to be con&s;idered as vicegerents allowed to reign over a &s;mall domain, and an&s;werable for their conduct to a higher tribunal, liable to error?</P>
<P>It will not be difficult to prove that &s;uch dele|gates will act like men &s;ubjected by fear, and make their children and &s;ervants endure their tyran|nical oppre&s;&s;ion.

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. OBSERVATIONS ON THE STATE OF DEGRA|DATION TO WHICH WOMAN IS REDUCED BY VARIOUS CAUSES.</HEAD>
<P>THAT woman is naturally weak, or de|graded by a concurrence of circum&s;tances, is, I think, clear. But this po&s;ition I &s;hall &s;imply con|tra&s;t with a conclu&s;ion, which I have frequen|ly heard fall from &s;en&s;ible men in favour of an ari&s;tocracy: that the ma&s;s of mankind cannot be any thing, or the ob&s;equious &s;laves, who patient|ly allow them&s;elves to be penned up, would feel their own con&s;equence, and &s;purn their chains. Men, they further ob&s;erve, &s;ubmit every where to oppre&s;&s;ion, when they have only to lift up their heads to throw off the yoke; yet, in&s;tead of a&s;&s;erting their birthright, they quietly lick the du&s;t, and &s;ay, let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die. Women, I argue from analogy, are de|graded by the &s;ame propen&s;ity to enjoy the pre|&s;ent moment; and, at la&s;t, de&s;pi&s;e the freedom which they have not &s;ufficient virtue to &s;truggle to attain. But I mu&s;t be more explicit.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the culture of the heart, it is unanimou&s;ly allowed that &s;ex is out of the que&s;|tion; but the line of &s;ubordination in the mental powers is never to be pa&s;&s;ed over<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Into what incon&s;i&s;tencies do men fall when they argue without the compa&s;s of principles. Women, weak women, are compared with angels; yet, a &s;uperiour order of beings &s;hould be &s;uppo&s;ed to po&s;&s;e&s;s more intellect than man; or, in what does their &s;uperiority con&s;i&s;t? In the &s;ame &s;tyle, to drop the &s;neer, they are allowed to po&s;&s;e&s;s more goodne&s;s of heart, piety, and benevolence.&mdash;I doubt the fact, though it be courteou&s;ly brought for|ward, unle&s;s ignorance be allowed to be the mother of devotion; for I am firmly per&s;uaded that, on an average, the proportion between virtue and knowledge, is more upon a par than is commonly granted.</NOTE>.

in loveline&s;s,' the portion of rationality granted to woman, is indeed very &s;canty; for, de|nying her genius and judgment, it is &s;carcely po&s;|&s;ible to divine what remains to characterize intel|lect.</P>
<P>The &s;tamina of immortality, if I may be al|lowed the phra&s;e, is the perfectibility of human rea&s;on: for, was man created perfect, or did a flood of knowledge break in upon him, when he arrived at maturity, that precluded error, I &s;hould doubt whether his exi&s;tence would be continued after the di&s;&s;olution of the body. But, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, every difficulty in morals that e&s;capes from human di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and equally baffles the inve&s;tigation of profound thinking, and the lightning glance of genius, is an argu|ment on which I build my belief of the immor|tality of the &s;oul. Rea&s;on is, con&s;equentially, the &s;imple power of improvement; or, more proper|ly &s;peaking, of di&s;cerning truth. Every individu|al is in this re&s;pect a world in it&s;elf. More or le&s;s may be con&s;picuous in one being than an|other; but the nature of rea&s;on mu&s;t be the &s;ame in all, if it be an emanation of divinity, the tie that connects the creature with the Creator; for, can that &s;oul be &s;tamped with the heavenly im|age, that is not perfected by the exerci&s;e of its

Yet outwardly ornamented with elaborate care, and &s;o adorned to delight man, 'that with honour he may love <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vide Milton.</NOTE>,' the &s;oul of woman is not allowed to have this di&s;tinction, and man, ever placed between her and rea&s;on, &s;he is always repre&s;ented as only created to &s;ee through a gro&s;s medium, and to take things on tru&s;t. But, di&s;mi&s;&s;ing the&s;e fanciful theories, and con&s;idering woman as a whole, let it be what it will, in&s;tead of a part of man, the in|quiry is whether &s;he has rea&s;on or not.

Merely to ob&s;erve, without endea|vouring to account for any thing, may (in a very incomplete manner) &s;erve as the common &s;en&s;e of life; but where is the &s;tore laid up that is to clothe the &s;oul when it leaves the body?</P>
<P>This power has not only been denied to wo|men; but writers have in&s;i&s;ted that it is incon|&s;i&s;tent,

with a few exceptions, with their &s;exual character. Let men prove this, and I &s;hall grant that woman only exi&s;ts for man. I mu&s;t, how|ever, previou&s;ly remark, that the power of gen|eralizing ideas, to any great extent, is not very common among&s;t men or women. But this ex|erci&s;e is the true cultivation of the under&s;tand|ing; and every thing con&s;pires to render the cul|tivation of the under&s;tanding more difficult in the female than the male world.</P>
<P>I am naturally led by this a&s;&s;ertion to the main &s;ubject of the pre&s;ent chapter, and &s;hall now at|tempt to point out &s;ome of the cau&s;es that degrade the &s;ex, and prevent women from generalizing their ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not go back to the remote annals of an|tiquity to trace the hi&s;tory of woman; it is &s;uf|ficient to allow that &s;he has always been either a &s;lave, or a de&s;pot, and to remark, that each of the&s;e &s;ituations equally retards the progre&s;s of rea&s;on. The grand &s;ource of female folly and vice has ever appeared to me to ari&s;e from nar|rowne&s;s of mind; and the very con&s;titution of civil governments has put almo&s;t in&s;uperable ob|&s;tacles in the way to prevent the cultivation of the female under&s;tanding:&mdash;yet virtue can be built on no other foundation! The &s;ame ob&s;tacles are thrown in the way of the rich, and the &s;ame con&s;equences en&s;ue.</P>
<P>Nece&s;&s;ity has been proverbially termed the mother of invention&mdash;the aphori&s;m may be ex|tended to virtue. It is an acquirement, and an acquirement to which plea&s;ure mu&s;t be &s;acrificed &mdash;and who &s;acrifice<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> plea&s;ure when it is within

the gra&s;p, who&s;e mind has not been opened and &s;trengthened by adver&s;ity, or the pur&s;uit of know|ledge goaded on by nece&s;&s;ity?&mdash;Happy is it when people have the cares of life to &s;truggle with; for the&s;e &s;truggles prevent their becoming a prey to enervating vices, merely from idlene&s;s! But, if from their birth men and women are placed in a torrid zone, with the meridian &s;un of plea&s;ure darting directly upon them, how can they &s;uffi|ciently brace their minds to di&s;charge the duties of life, or even to reli&s;h the affections that carry them out of them&s;elves?</P>
<P>Plea&s;ure is the bu&s;ine&s;s of woman's life, ac|cording to the pre&s;ent modification of &s;ociety, and while it continues to be &s;o, little can be ex|pected from &s;uch weak beings. Inheriting, in a lineal de&s;cent from the fir&s;t fair defect in na|ture, the &s;overeignty of beauty, they have, to maintain their power, re&s;igned the natural rights, which the exerci&s;e of rea&s;on might have procur|ed them, and cho&s;en rather to be &s;hort-lived queens than labour to obtain the &s;ober plea&s;ures that ari&s;e from equality. Exalted by their infe|riority (this &s;ounds like a contradiction) they con&s;tantly demand homage as women, though ex|perience &s;hould teach them that the men who pride them&s;elves upon paying this arbitrary in&s;o|lent re&s;pect to the &s;ex, with the mo&s;t &s;crupulous exactne&s;s, are mo&s;t inclined to tyrannize over, and de&s;pi&s;e, the very weakne&s;s they cheri&s;h.

<P>Ah! why do women, I write with affection|ate &s;olicitude, conde&s;cend to receive a degree of attention and re&s;pect from &s;trangers, different from that reciprocation of civility which the dic|tates of humanity and the politene&s;s of civiliza|tion authori&s;e between man and man? And, why do they not di&s;cover, when 'in the noon of beau|ty's power,' that they are treated like queens on|ly to be deluded by hollow re&s;pect, till they are led to re&s;ign, or not a&s;&s;ume, their natural pre|rogatives? Confined then in cages like the fea|thered race, they have nothing to do but to plume them&s;elves, and &s;talk with mock maje&s;ty from perch to perch. It is true they are provided with food and raiment, for which they neither toil nor &s;pin; but health, liberty, and virtue, are given in exchange. But, where, among&s;t man|kind has been found &s;ufficient &s;trength of mind to enable a being to re&s;ign the&s;e adventitious pre|rogatives; one who, ri&s;ing with the calm digni|ty

<P>The pa&s;&s;ions of men have thus placed women on thrones, and, till mankind become more rea|&s;onable, it is to be feared that women will avail them&s;elves of the power which they attain with the lea&s;t exertion, and which is the mo&s;t indi&s;|putable.

XIV. during the greater part of his reign, was regarded, not only in France, but over all Europe, as the mo&s;t perfect model of a great prince. But what were the talents and virtues by which he acquired this great reputation?

Was it by his exten&s;ive knowledge, by his exqui&s;ite judg|ment, or by his heroic valour? It was by none of the&s;e qualities. But he was, fir&s;t of all, the mo&s;t powerful prince in Europe, and con&s;e|quently held the highe&s;t rank among kings; and then, &s;ays his hi&s;torian,
<Q>he &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all his courtiers in the gracefulne&s;s of his &s;hape, and the maje&s;tic beauty of his features. The &s;ound of his voice, noble and affecting, gained tho&s;e hearts which his pre&s;ence intimidated. He had a &s;tep and a deportment which could &s;uit only him and his rank, and which would have been ridiculous in any other per&s;on. The embarra&s;&s;ment which he occa&s;ioned to tho&s;e who &s;poke to him, flattered that &s;ecret &s;ati&s;|faction with which he felt his own &s;uperiori|ty.</Q>
The&s;e frivolous accompli&s;hments, &s;up|ported by his rank, and, no doubt too, by a de|gree of other talents and virtues, which &s;eems, however, not to have been much above medi|ocrity, e&s;tabli&s;hed this prince in the e&s;teem of his own age, and have drawn, even from po&s;|terity, a good deal of re&s;pect for his memory.

<P>In the middle rank of life, to continue the compari&s;on, men, in their youth, are prepared for profe&s;&s;ions, and marriage is not con&s;idered as the grand feature in their lives; whil&s;t women, on the contrary, have no other &s;cheme to &s;harpen their faculties. It is not bu&s;ine&s;s, exten&s;ive plans, or any of the excur&s;ive flights of ambition, that engro&s;s their attention; no, their thoughts are not employed in rearing &s;uch noble &s;tructures. To ri&s;e in the world, and have the liberty of run|ning from plea&s;ure to plea&s;ure, they mu&s;t marry advantageou&s;ly, and to this object their time is &s;acrificed, and their per&s;ons often legally pro&s;ti|tuted. A man when be enters any profe&s;&s;ion has his eye &s;teadily fixed on &s;ome future advantage (and the mind gains great &s;trength by having all its efforts directed to one point) and, full of his bu&s;ine&s;s, plea&s;ure is con&s;idered as mere relaxation; whil&s;t women &s;eek for plea&s;ure as the main pur|po&s;e of exi&s;tence. In fact, from the education,
<PB N="108" REF="025054_0105_0FCDB61A78C36328">
which they receive from &s;ociety, the love of plea&s;ure may be &s;aid to govern them all; but does this prove that there is a &s;ex in &s;ouls?

I di&s;cern not a trace of the image of God in either &s;en&s;ation or matter. Refined &s;eventy times &s;even, they are &s;till material; intellect dwells not there; nor will fire ever make lead gold!</P>
<P>I come round to my old argument; if woman be allowed to have an immortal &s;oul, &s;he mu&s;t have, as the employment of life, an under&s;tand|ing to improve. And when, to render the pre|&s;ent &s;tate more complete, though every thing proves it to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> but a fraction of a mighty &s;um, &s;he is incited by pre&s;ent gratification to forget her grand de&s;tination, Nature is counteracted, or &s;he was born only to procreate and die. Or, grant|ing brutes, of every de&s;cription, a &s;oul, though not a rea&s;onable one, the exerci&s;e of in&s;tinct and &s;en&s;ibility may be the &s;tep, which they are to take, in this life, towards the attainment of rea|&s;on in the next; &s;o that through all eternity they will lag behind man, who, why we cannot tell, had the power given him of attaining rea&s;on in his fir&s;t mode of exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>When I treat of the peculiar duties of women, as I &s;hould treat of the peculiar duties of a citizen or father, it will be found that I do not mean to

<Q>He that hath wife and children,</Q>
&s;ays Lord Bacon,
<Q>hath giv|en ho&s;tages to fortune; for they are impedi|ments to great enterpri&s;es, either of virtue or mi&s;chief. Certainly the be&s;t works, and of greate&s;t merit for the public, have proceeded from the unmarried or childle&s;s men.</Q>
I &s;ay the &s;ame of women. But, the welfare of &s;ociety is not built on extraordinary exertions; and were it more rea&s;onably organized, there would be &s;till le&s;s need of great abilities, or heroic vir|tues.</P>
<P>In the regulation of a family, in the education of children, under&s;tanding, in an un&s;ophi&s;ticated &s;en&s;e, is particularly required: &s;trength both of body and mind; yet the men who, by their writings, have mo&s;t earne&s;tly laboured to dome&s;|ticate women, have endeavoured, by arguments dictated by a gro&s;s appetite, that &s;atiety had ren|dered fa&s;tidious, to weaken their bodies and cramp their minds. But, if even by the&s;e &s;ini&s;ter me|thods they really <HI>per&s;uaded</HI> women, by working on their feelings, to &s;tay at home, and fulfil the duties of a mother and mi&s;tre&s;s of a family, I &s;hould cautiou&s;ly oppo&s;e opinions that led wo|men to right conduct, by prevailing on them to make the di&s;charge of a duty the bu&s;ine&s;s of life, though rea&s;on were in&s;ulted. Yet, and I appeal to experience, if by neglecting the under&s;tanding they are as much, nay, more detached from the&s;e dome&s;tic duties, than they could be by the mo&s;t &s;erious intellectual pur&s;uit, though it may be ob|&s;erved that the ma&s;s of mankind will never vigor|ou&s;ly

<P>The compari&s;on with the rich &s;till occurs to me; for, when men neglect the duties of hu|manity, women will do the &s;ame; a common &s;tream hurries them both along with thought|le&s;s celerity. Riches and honours prevent a man from enlarging his under&s;tanding, and enervate all his powers by rever&s;ing the order of nature, which has ever made true plea&s;ure the reward of labour. Plea&s;ure&mdash;enervating plea&s;ure is, like|wi&s;e, within women's reach without earning it. But, till hereditary po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions are &s;pread abroad, how can we expect men to be proud of virtue? And, till they are, women will govern them by the mo&s;t direct means, neglecting their dull do|me&s;tic duties to catch the plea&s;ure that is on the wing of time.</P>
<P>'The power of the woman,' &s;ays &s;ome author, 'is her &s;en&s;ibility;' and men, not aware of the con&s;equence, do all they can to make this power &s;wallow up every other. Tho&s;e who con&s;tantly employ their &s;en&s;ibility will have mo&s;t; for ex|ample; poets, painters, and compo&s;ers<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Men of the&s;e de&s;criptions pour it into their compo&s;itions, to amalga|mate the gro&s;s materials; and, moulding them with pa&s;&s;ion, give to the inert body a &s;oul; but, in woman's imagination, love alone concentrates the&s;e etherial beams.</NOTE>. Yet, when the &s;en&s;ibility is thus increa&s;ed at the ex|pen&s;e of rea&s;on, and even the imagination, why
<PB N="116" REF="025054_0113_0FCDB62D39E7C2D0">
do philo&s;ophical men complain of their fickle|ne&s;s? The &s;exual attention of man particularly acts on female &s;en&s;ibility, and this &s;ympathy has been exerci&s;ed from their youth up. A hu&s;band cannot long pay tho&s;e attentions with the pa&s;|&s;ion nece&s;&s;ary to excite lively emotions, and the heart, accu&s;tomed to lively emotions, turns to a new lover, or pines in &s;ecret, the prey of virtue or prudence. I mean when the heart has really been rendered &s;u&s;ceptible, and the ta&s;te formed; for I am apt to conclude, from what I have &s;een in fa&s;hionable life, that vanity is oftener fo&s;tered than &s;en&s;ibility by the mode of educa|tion, and the intercour&s;e between the &s;exes, which I have reprobated; and that coquetry more frequently proceeds from vanity than from that incon&s;tancy, which over&s;trained &s;en&s;ibility naturally produces.</P>
<P>Another argument that has had a great weight with me, mu&s;t, I think, have &s;ome force with every con&s;iderate, benevolent heart. Girls who have been thus weakly educated, are often cruelly left by their parents without any provi&s;ion; and, of cour&s;e, are dependent on, not only the rea&s;on, but the bounty of their brothers. The&s;e broth|ers are, to view the faire&s;t &s;ide of the que&s;tion, good &s;ort of men, and give as a favour, what chil|dren of the &s;ame parents had an equal right to. In this equivocal humiliating &s;ituation, a docile female may remain &s;ome time, with a tolerable degree of comfort. But, when the brother mar|ries, a probable circum&s;tance, from being con&s;id|ered as the mi&s;tre&s;s of the family, &s;he is viewed with averted looks as an intruder, an unnece&s;&s;ary
<PB N="117" REF="025054_0114_0FCDB6322A8B3470">
burden on the benevolence of the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e, and his new partner.</P>
<P>Who can recount the mi&s;ery, which many un|fortunate beings, who&s;e minds and bodies are equally weak, &s;uffer in &s;uch &s;ituations&mdash;unable to work, and a&s;hamed to beg? The wife, a cold-hearted, narrow-minded, woman, and this is not an unfair &s;uppo&s;ition; for the pre&s;ent mode of education does not tend to enlarge the heart any more than the under&s;tanding, is jealous of the lit|tle kindne&s;s which her hu&s;band &s;hews to his re|lations; and her &s;en&s;ibility not ri&s;ing to human|ity, &s;he is di&s;plea&s;ed at &s;eeing the property of <HI>her</HI> children lavi&s;hed on an helple&s;s &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>The&s;e are matters of fact, which have come under my eye, again and again. The con&s;e|quence is obvious, the wife has recour&s;e to cun|ning to undermine the habitual affection, which &s;he is afraid openly to oppo&s;e; and neither tears nor care&s;&s;es are &s;pared till the &s;py is worked out of her home, and thrown on the world, unpre|pared for its difficulties; or &s;ent, as a great effort of genero&s;ity, or from &s;ome regard to propriety, with a &s;mall &s;tipend, and an uncultivated mind, into joyle&s;s &s;olitude.</P>
<P>The&s;e two women may be much upon a par, with re&s;pect to rea&s;on and humanity; and chang|ing &s;ituations might have acted ju&s;t the &s;ame &s;elf|i&s;h part; but had they been differently educated, the ca&s;e would al&s;o have been very different. The wife would not have had that &s;en&s;ibility, of which &s;elf is the centre, and rea&s;on might have taught her not to expect, and not even to be flattered, by the affection of her hu&s;band, if it led him to vio|late
<PB N="118" REF="025054_0115_0FCDB633B3EE8288">
prior duties. She would wi&s;h not to love him merely becau&s;e he loved her, but on account of his virtues; and the &s;i&s;ter might have been able to &s;truggle for her&s;elf in&s;tead of eating the bitter bread of dependence.</P>
<P>I am, indeed, per&s;uaded that the heart, as well as the under&s;tanding, is opened by cultivation; and by, which may not appear &s;o clear, &s;trength|ening the organs; I am not now talking of mo|mentary fla&s;hes of &s;en&s;ibility, but of affections. And, perhaps, in the education of both &s;exes, the mo&s;t difficult ta&s;k is &s;o to adju&s;t in&s;truction as not to narrow the under&s;tanding, whil&s;t the heart is warmed by the generous juices of &s;pring, ju&s;t rai&s;ed by the electric fermentation of the &s;ea&s;on; nor to dry up the feelings by employing the mind in inve&s;tigations remote from life.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to women, when they receive a careful education, they are either made fine la|dies, brimful of &s;en&s;ibility, and teeming with capricious fancies; or mere notable women. The latter are often friendly, hone&s;t creatures, and have a &s;hrewd kind of good &s;en&s;e joined with worldly prudence, that often render them more u&s;eful members of &s;ociety than the fine &s;enti|mental lady, though they po&s;&s;e&s;s neither great|ne&s;s of mind nor ta&s;te. The intellectual world is &s;hut again&s;t them; take them out of their fami|ly or neighbourhood, and they &s;tand &s;till; the mind finding no employment, for literature af|fords a fund of amu&s;ement which they have never &s;ought to reli&s;h, but frequently to de&s;pi&s;e. The &s;entiments and ta&s;te of more cultivated minds ap|pear ridiculous, even in tho&s;e whom chance and
<PB N="119" REF="025054_0116_0FCDB635611CF590">
family connections have led them to love; but in mere acquaintance they think it all affectation.</P>
<P>A man of &s;en&s;e can only love &s;uch a woman on account of her &s;ex, and re&s;pect her, becau&s;e &s;he is a tru&s;ty &s;ervant. He lets her, to pre&s;erve his own peace, &s;cold the &s;ervants, and go to church in clothes made of the very be&s;t materials. A man of her own &s;ize of under&s;tanding would, probably, not agree &s;o well with her; for he might wi&s;h to encroach on her prerogative, and manage &s;ome dome&s;tic concerns him&s;elf. Yet women, who&s;e minds are not enlarged by culti|vation, or the natural &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s of &s;en&s;ibility ex|panded by reflection, are very unfit to manage a family; for, by an undue &s;tretch of power, they are always tyrannizing to &s;upport a &s;uperiority that only re&s;ts on the arbitrary di&s;tinction of for|tune. The evil is &s;ometimes more &s;erious, and dome&s;tics are deprived of innocent indulgences; and made to work beyond their &s;trength, in order to enable the notable woman to keep a better table, and out&s;hine her neighbours in finery and parade. If &s;he attend to her children, it is, in general, to dre&s;s them in a co&s;tly manner&mdash;and, whether this attention ari&s;es from vanity or fond|ne&s;s, it is equally pernicious.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, how many women of this de&s;cription pa&s;s their days; or, at lea&s;t, their evenings, di&s;|contentedly. Their hu&s;bands acknowledge that they are good managers, and cha&s;te wives; but leave home to &s;eek for more agreeable, may I be allowed to u&s;e a &s;ignificant French word, <HI>piquant</HI> &s;ociety; and the patient drudge, who fulfils her ta&s;k, like a blind hor&s;e in a mill, is defrauded of
<PB N="120" REF="025054_0117_0FCDB63641F3DCD8">
her ju&s;t reward; for the wages due to her are the care&s;&s;es of her hu&s;band; and women who have &s;o few re&s;ources in them&s;elves, do not very patient|ly bear this privation of a natural right.</P>
<P>A fine lady, on the contrary, has been taught to look down with contempt on the vulgar em|ployments of life; though &s;he has only been in|cited to acquire accompli&s;hments that ri&s;e a de|gree above &s;en&s;e; for even corporeal accompli&s;h|ments cannot be acquired with any degree of preci&s;ion unle&s;s the under&s;tanding has been &s;trengthened by exerci&s;e. Without a foundation of principles ta&s;te is &s;uperficial; and grace mu&s;t ari&s;e from &s;omething deeper than imitation. The imagination, however, is heated, and the feelings rendered fa&s;tidious, if not &s;ophi&s;ticated; or, a counterpoi&s;e of judgment is not acquired, when the heart &s;till remains artle&s;s, though it becomes too tender.</P>
<P>The&s;e women are often amiable; and their hearts are really more &s;en&s;ible to general benevo|lence, more alive to the &s;entiments that civilize life, than the &s;quare-elbowed family drudge; but, wanting a du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> proportion of reflection and &s;elf-government, they only in&s;pire love; and are the mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of their hu&s;bands, whil&s;t they have any hold on their affections; and the platonic friends of his male acquaintance. The&s;e are the fair defects in nature; the women who appear to be created not to enjoy the fellow&s;hip of man, but to &s;ave him from &s;inking into ab&s;olute bru|tality, by rubbing off the rough angles of his character; and by playful dalliance to give &s;ome dignity to the appetite that draws him to them.

Gracious Creator of the whole human race! ha&s;t thou created &s;uch a being as woman, who can trace thy wi&s;dom in thy works, and feel that thou alone art by thy nature, exalted above her,&mdash;for no better purpo&s;e?&mdash;Can &s;he believe that &s;he was only made to &s;ubmit to man, her equal; a being, who, like her, was &s;ent into the world to acquire virtue?&mdash;Can &s;he con&s;ent to be occupied merely to plea&s;e him; merely to adorn the earth, when her &s;oul is capable of ri&s;ing to thee?&mdash;And can &s;he re&s;t &s;upinely dependent on man for rea|&s;on, when &s;he ought to mount with him the ar|duous &s;teeps of knowledge?&mdash;</P>
<P>Yet, if love be the &s;upreme good, let women be only educated to in&s;pire it, and let every charm be poli&s;hed to intoxicate the &s;en&s;es; but, if they are moral beings, let them have a chance to be|come intelligent; and let love to man be only a part of that glowing flame of univer&s;al love, which, after encircling humanity, mounts in grateful incen&s;e to God.</P>
<P>To fulfil dome&s;tic duties much re&s;olution is nece&s;&s;ary, and a &s;erious kind of per&s;everance that requires a more firm &s;upport than emotions, how|ever lively and true to nature.

Whoever rationally means to be u&s;eful mu&s;t have a plan of conduct; and, in the di&s;charge of the &s;imple&s;t duty, we are often obliged to act con|trary to the pre&s;ent impul&s;e of tenderne&s;s or com|pa&s;&s;ion.

as well as the mo&s;t &s;ublime proof of affection; and the want of this power over the feelings, and of that lofty, dignified affection, which makes a per&s;on prefer the future good of the beloved object to a pre&s;ent gratification, is the rea&s;on why &s;o many fond mothers &s;poil their children, and has made it que&s;tionable whether negligence or indulgence is mo&s;t hurtful: but I am inclined to think, that the latter has done mo&s;t harm.</P>
<P>Mankind &s;eem to agree that children &s;hould be left under the management of women during their childhood. Now, from all the ob&s;ervation that I have been able to make, women of &s;en&s;i|bility are the mo&s;t unfit for this ta&s;k, becau&s;e they will infallibly, carried away by their feelings, &s;poil a child's temper. The management of the temper, the fir&s;t, and mo&s;t important branch of education, requires the &s;ober &s;teady eye of rea|&s;on; a plan of conduct equally di&s;tant from ty|ranny and indulgence: yet the&s;e are the extremes that people of &s;en&s;ibility alternately fall into; al|ways &s;hooting beyond the mark. I have follow|ed this train of rea&s;oning much further, till I have concluded, that a per&s;on of genius is the mo&s;t improper per&s;on to be employed in education, public or private. Minds of this rare &s;pecies &s;ee things too much in ma&s;&s;es, and &s;eldom, if ever, have a good temper. That habitual cheerful|ne&s;s, termed good-humour, is, perhaps, as &s;el|dom united with great mental powers, as with &s;trong feelings. And tho&s;e people who follow, with intere&s;t and admiration, the flights of ge|nius; or, with cooler approbation &s;uck in the in&s;truction which has been elaborately prepared

for them by the profound thinker, ought not to be di&s;gu&s;ted, if they find the former choleric, and the latter moro&s;e; becau&s;e liveline&s;s of fancy, and a tenacious comprehen&s;ion of mind, are &s;carcely compatible with that pliant urbanity which leads a man, at lea&s;t, to bend to the opin|ions and prejudices of others, in&s;tead of roughly confronting them.</P>
<P>But, treating of education or manners, minds of a &s;uperior cla&s;s are not to be con&s;idered, they may be left to chance; it is the multitude, with moderate abilities, who call for in&s;truction, and catch the colour of the atmo&s;phere they breathe. This re&s;pectable concour&s;e, I contend, men and women, &s;hould not have their &s;en&s;ations height|ened in the hot-bed of luxurious indolence, at the expen&s;e of their under&s;tanding; for, unle&s;s there be a balla&s;t of under&s;tanding, they will never become either virtuous or free: an ari&s;toc|racy, founded on property, or &s;terling talents, will ever &s;weep before it, the alternately timid, and ferocious, &s;laves of feeling.</P>
<P>Numberle&s;s are the arguments, to take another view of the &s;ubject, brought forward with a &s;hew of rea&s;on: becau&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed to be deduced from nature, that men have u&s;ed morally and phy&s;ical|ly, to degrade the &s;ex. I mu&s;t notice a few.</P>
<P>The female under&s;tanding has often been &s;pok|en of with contempt, as arriving &s;ooner at ma|turity than the male. I &s;hall not an&s;wer this argument by alluding to the early proofs of rea|&s;on, as well as genius, in Cowley, Milton, and Pope<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Many other names might be added.</NOTE>, but only appeal to experience to decide whether young men, who are early introduced
<PB N="124" REF="025054_0121_0FCDB63F38B3D2C8">
into company (and examples now abound) do not acquire the &s;ame precocity. So notorious is this fact, that the bare mentioning of it mu&s;t bring before people, who at all mix in the world, the idea of a number of &s;waggering apes of men, who&s;e under&s;tandings are narrowed by being brought into the &s;ociety of men when they ought to have been &s;pinning a top or twirling a hoop.</P>
<P>It has al&s;o been a&s;&s;erted, by &s;ome naturali&s;ts, that men do not attain their full growth and &s;trength till thirty; but that women arrive at maturity by twenty. I apprehend that they rea|&s;on on fal&s;e ground, led a&s;tray by the male pre|judice, which deems beauty the perfection of woman&mdash;mere beauty of features and complex|ion, the vulgar acceptation of the word, whil&s;t male beauty is allowed to have &s;ome connection with the mind. Strength of body, and that character of countenance, which the French term a <HI>phy&s;ionomie,</HI> women do not acquire before thirty, any more than men. The little artle&s;s tricks of children, it is true, are particularly plea&s;ing and attractive; yet, when the pretty fre&s;hne&s;s of youth is worn off, the&s;e artle&s;s graces become &s;tudied airs, and di&s;gu&s;t every per&s;on of ta&s;te. In the countenance of girls we only look for vivacity and ba&s;hful mode&s;ty; but, the &s;pring|tide of life over, we look for &s;oberer &s;en&s;e in the face, and for traces of pa&s;&s;ion, in&s;tead of the dim|ples of animal &s;pirits; expecting to &s;ee individ|uality of character, the only fa&s;tener of the af|fections<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;trength of an affection is, generally, in the &s;ame proportion as the character of the &s;pecies in the object beloved, is lo&s;t in that of the indi|vidu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l.</NOTE>.

fondle; to give &s;cope to our imaginations as well as to the &s;en&s;ations of our hearts.</P>
<P>At twenty the beauty of both &s;exes is equal; but the libertini&s;m of man leads him to make the di&s;tinction, and &s;uperannuated coquettes are com|monly of the &s;ame opinion; for, when they can no longer in&s;pire love, they pay for the vigour and vivacity of youth. The French, who admit more of mind into their notions of beauty, give the preference to women of thirty. I mean to &s;ay that they allow women to be in their mo&s;t perfect &s;tate, when vivacity gives place to rea&s;on, and to that maje&s;tic &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s of character, which marks maturity;&mdash;or, the re&s;ting point. In youth, till twenty, the body &s;hoots out, till thir|ty the &s;olids are attaining a degree of den&s;ity; and the flexible mu&s;cles, growing daily more rigid, give character to the countenance; that is, they trace the operations of the mind with the iron pen of fate, and tell us not only what pow|ers are within, but how they have been employ|ed.</P>
<P>It is proper to ob&s;erve, that animals who ar|rive &s;lowly at maturity, are the longe&s;t lived, and of the noble&s;t &s;pecies. Men cannot, however, claim any natural &s;uperiority from the grandeur of longevity; for in this re&s;pect nature has not di&s;tingui&s;hed the male.</P>
<P>Polygamy is another phy&s;ical degradation; and a plau&s;ible argument for a cu&s;tom, that bla&s;ts every dome&s;tic virtue, is drawn from the well-atte&s;ted fact, that in the countries where it is e&s;tabli&s;hed, more females are born than males. This appears to be an indication of nature, and
<PB N="126" REF="025054_0123_0FCDB6424029C368">
to nature, apparently rea&s;onable &s;peculations mu&s;t yield. A further conclu&s;ion obviou&s;ly pre&s;ented it&s;elf; if polygamy be nece&s;&s;ary, woman mu&s;t be inferiour to man, and made for him.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the formation of the foetus in the womb, we are very ignorant; but it appears to me probable, that an accidental phy&s;ical cau&s;e may account for this phenomenon, and prove it not to be a law of nature. I have met with &s;ome pertinent ob&s;ervations on the &s;ubject in For&s;ter's Account of the I&s;les of the South-Sea, that will explain my meaning.

<P><Q>In the greater part of Europe it has been proved by the mo&s;t accurate li&s;ts of mortality, that the proportion of men to women is nearly equal, or, if any difference takes place, the males born are more numerous, in the proportion of 105 to 100.</Q></P>

<P>A woman who has lo&s;t her honour, imagines that &s;he cannot fall lower, and as for recovering her former &s;tation, it is impo&s;&s;ible; no exertion can wa&s;h this &s;tain away.

Meretricious airs, and the whole &s;cience of wantonne&s;s, has then a more powerful &s;timulous than either ap|petite or vanity; and this remark gives force to the prevailing opinion, that with cha&s;tity all is lo&s;t that is re&s;pectable in woman. Her charac|ter depends on the ob&s;ervance of one virtue, though the only pa&s;&s;ion fo&s;tered in her heart&mdash;is love. Nay, the honour of a woman is not made even to depend on her will.</P>

the &s;ex from whom they pretend to receive the chief plea&s;ure of life; and I have frequently with full conviction retorted Pope's &s;arca&s;m on them; or, to &s;peak explicitly, it has appeared to me ap|plicable to the whole human race. A love of plea&s;ure or &s;way &s;eems to divide mankind, and the hu&s;band who lords it in his little haram thinks only of his plea&s;ure or his convenience.

<P>Love, con&s;idered as an animal appetite, cannot long feed on it&s;elf without expiring. And this extinction, in its own flame, may be termed the violent death of love. But the wife who has thus been rendered licentious, will probably en|deavour to fill the void left by the lo&s;s of her hu&s;band's attentions; for &s;he cannot contented|ly become merely an upper &s;ervant after having been treated like a godde&s;s. She is &s;till hand|&s;ome, and, in&s;tead of transferring her fondne&s;s to her children, &s;he only dreams of enjoying the &s;un&s;hine of life. Be&s;ides, there are many hu&s;|bands &s;o devoid of &s;en&s;e and parental affection, that during the fir&s;t efferve&s;cence of voluptuous fondne&s;s they refu&s;e to let their wives &s;uckle their children.

young people marry, it would, perhaps, be hap|py if &s;ome circum&s;tances checked their pa&s;&s;ion; if the recollection of &s;ome prior attachment, or di&s;appointed affection, made it on one &s;ide, at lea&s;t, rather a match founded on e&s;teem. In that ca&s;e they would look beyond the pre&s;ent moment, and try to render the whole of life re&s;pectable, by forming a plan to regulate a friend&s;hip which only death ought to di&s;&s;olve.</P>
<P>Friend&s;hip is a &s;erious affection; the mo&s;t &s;u|blime of all affections, becau&s;e it is founded on principle, and cemented by time. The very re|ver&s;e may be &s;aid of love. In a great degree, love and friend&s;hip cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t in the &s;ame bo&s;om; even when in&s;pired by different objects they weak|en or de&s;troy each other, and for the &s;ame object can only be felt in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The vain fears and fond jealou&s;ies, the winds which fan the flame of love, when judiciou&s;ly or artfully tem|pered, are both incompatible with the tender confidence and &s;incere re&s;pect of friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>Love, &s;uch as the glowing pen of genius has traced, exi&s;ts not on earth, or only re&s;ides in tho&s;e exalted, fervid imaginations that have &s;ketched &s;uch dangerous pictures.

in&s;idious attempt to ha&s;ten her fall by apparent re&s;pect. Virtue and plea&s;ure are not, in fact, &s;o nearly allied in this life as &s;ome eloquent writers have laboured to prove. Plea&s;ure prepares the fading wreath, and mixes the intoxicating cup; but the fruit which virtue gives, is the recom|pence of toil: and, gradually &s;een as it ripens, only affords calm &s;atisfaction; nay, appearing to be the re&s;ult of the natural tendency of things, it is &s;carcely ob&s;erved. Bread, the common food of life, &s;eldom thought of as a ble&s;&s;ing, &s;upports the con&s;titution and pre&s;erves health; &s;till fea&s;ts delight the heart of man, though di&s;ea&s;e and even death lurk in the cup or dainty that elevates the &s;pirits or tickles the palate. The lively heated imagination, in the &s;ame &s;tyle, draws the picture of love, as it draws every other picture, with tho&s;e glowing colours, which the daring hand, will &s;teal from the rainbow that is directed by a mind, con|demned in a world like this, to prove its noble origin by panting after unattainable perfection; ever pur&s;uing what it acknowledges to be a fleet|ing dream. An imagination of this vigorous ca&s;t can give exi&s;tence to in&s;ub&s;tantial forms, and &s;ta|bility to the &s;hadowy reveries which the mind naturally falls into when realities are found vapid. It can then depict love with cele&s;tial charms, and dote on the grand ideal object&mdash;it can imagine a degree of mutual affection that &s;hall refine the &s;oul, and not expire when it has &s;erved as a '&s;cale to heavenly;' and, like devotion, make it ab&s;orb every meaner affection and de&s;ire. In each oth|ers arms, as in a temple, with its &s;ummit lo&s;t in the clouds, the world is to be &s;hut out, and every

Yet the eager pur&s;uit of the good which every one &s;hapes to his own fancy, proclaims man the lord of this lower world, and to be an intelligent creature, who is not to receive, but to acquire happine&s;s. They, therefore, who complain of the delu&s;ions of pa&s;&s;ion, do not recollect that they are exclaim|ing again&s;t a &s;trong proof of the immortality of the &s;oul.</P>
<P>But leaving &s;uperiour minds to correct them|&s;elves, and pay dearly for their experience, it is nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that it is not again&s;t &s;trong, per&s;evering pa&s;&s;ions; but romantic wavering feel|ings that I wi&s;h to guard the female heart by exerci&s;ing the under&s;tanding: for the&s;e paradi&s;ia|cal reveries are oftener the effect of idlene&s;s than of a lively fancy.</P>

&s;hould a more laudable ambition ever gain ground they may be brought nearer to nature and rea|&s;on; and become more virtuous and u&s;eful as they grow more re&s;pectable.</P>
<P>But, I will venture to a&s;&s;ert that their rea&s;on will never acquire &s;ufficient &s;trength to enable it to regulate their conduct, whil&s;t the making an appearance in the world is the fir&s;t wi&s;h of the majority of mankind. To this weak wi&s;h the natural affections, and the mo&s;t u&s;eful virtues are &s;acrificed. Girls marry merely to <HI>better them|&s;elves,</HI> to borrow a &s;ignificant vulgar phra&s;e, and have &s;uch perfect power over their hearts as not to permit them&s;elves to <HI>fall in love</HI> till a man with a &s;uperiour fortune offers. On this &s;ubject I mean to enlarge in a future chapter; it is only ne|ce&s;&s;ary to drop a hint at pre&s;ent, becau&s;e women are &s;o often degraded by &s;uffering the &s;elfi&s;h prudence of age to chill the ardour of youth.</P>
<P>From the &s;ame &s;ource flows an opinion that young girls ought to dedicate great part of their time to needle-work; yet, this employment contracts their faculties more than any other that could have been cho&s;en for them, by con|fining their thoughts to their per&s;ons. Men order their clothes to be made, and have done with the &s;ubject; women make their own clothes, nece&s;&s;ary or ornamental, and are continually talk|ing about them; and their thoughts follow their hands. It is not indeed the making of nece&s;&s;a|ries that weakens the mind; but the frippery of dre&s;s. For when a woman in the lower rank of life makes her hu&s;band's and children's clothes, &s;he does her duty, this is a part of her bu&s;ine&s;s;
<PB N="135" REF="025054_0132_0FCDB65738CE9658">
but when women work only to dre&s;s better than they could otherwi&s;e afford, it is wor&s;e than &s;heer lo&s;s of time. To render the poor virtuous they mu&s;t be employed, and women in the middle rank of life, did they not ape the fa&s;hions of the nobility, without catching their ea&s;e, might em|ploy them, whil&s;t they them&s;elves managed their families, in&s;tructed their children, and exerci&s;ed their own minds. Gardening, experimental phi|lo&s;ophy, and literature, would afford them &s;ub|jects to think of and matter for conver&s;ation, that in &s;ome degree would exerci&s;e their under&s;tand|ings. The conver&s;ation of French women, who are not &s;o rigidly nailed to their chairs to twi&s;t lappets, and knot ribbons, is frequently &s;uperfi|cial; but, I contend, that it is not half &s;o in&s;ipid as that of tho&s;e Engli&s;h women who&s;e time is &s;pent in making caps, bonnets, and the whole mi&s;chief of trimmings, not to mention &s;hop|ping, bargain-hunting, &amp;c. &amp;c. and it is the decent, prudent women, who are mo&s;t degraded by the&s;e practices; for their motive is &s;imply vanity. The wanton who exerci&s;es her ta&s;te to render her per&s;on alluring, has &s;omething more in view.</P>
<P>The&s;e ob&s;ervations all branch out of a general one, which I have before made, and which can|not be too often in&s;i&s;ted upon, for, &s;peaking of men, women, or profe&s;&s;ions, it will be found that the employment of the thoughts &s;hapes the character both generally and individually. The thoughts of women ever hover round their per|&s;ons, and is it &s;urpri&s;ing that their per&s;ons are reckoned mo&s;t valuable? Yet &s;ome degree of
<PB N="136" REF="025054_0133_0FCDB6596D2F46A8">
liberty of mind is nece&s;&s;ary even to form the per|&s;on; and this may be one rea&s;on why &s;ome gen|tle wives have &s;o few attractions be&s;ide that of &s;ex. Add to this, &s;edentary employments render the majority of women &s;ickly&mdash;and fal&s;e notions of female excellence make them proud of this deli|cacy, though it be another fetter, that by calling the attention continually to the body, cramps the activity of the mind.</P>
<P>Women of quality &s;eldom do any of the man|ual part of their dre&s;s, con&s;equently only their ta&s;te is exerci&s;ed, and they acquire, by thinking le&s;s of the finery, when the bu&s;ine&s;s of their toi|let is over, that ea&s;e, which &s;eldom appears in the deportment of women, who dre&s;s merely for the &s;ake of dre&s;&s;ing. In fact, the ob&s;ervation with re&s;pect to the middle rank, the one in which talents thrive be&s;t, extends not to women; for tho&s;e of the &s;uperiour cla&s;s, by catching, at lea&s;t, a &s;mattering of literature, and conver&s;ing more with men, on general topics, acquire more know|ledge than the women who ape their fa&s;hions and faults without &s;haring their advantages. With re&s;pect to virtue, to u&s;e the word in a com|prehen&s;ive &s;en&s;e, I have &s;een mo&s;t in low life. Many poor women maintain their children by the &s;weat of their brow, and keep together fami|lies that the vices of the fathers would have &s;cat|tered abroad; but gentle-women are too indolent to be actively virtuous, and are &s;oftened rather than refined by civilization.

<P><Q>Hence we deduce a third con&s;equence from the different con&s;titutions of the &s;exes; which is, that the &s;tronge&s;t &s;hould be ma&s;ters in ap|pearance, and be dependent in fact on the weake&s;t; and that not from any frivolous prac|tice of gallantry or vanity of protector&s;hip, but from an invariable law of nature, which, fur|ni&s;hing woman with a greater facility to excite de&s;ires than &s;he has given man to &s;atisfy them, makes the latter dependent on the good plea&s;ure of the former, and compels him to endeavour to plea&s;e in his turn, <HI>in order to obtain her con|&s;ent that he &s;hould be &s;tronge&s;t</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">What non&s;en&s;e!</NOTE>.

<P>Supposing woman to have been formed only to plea&s;e, and be &s;ubject to man, the conclu&s;ion is ju&s;t, &s;he ought to &s;acrifice every other con&s;ider|ation to render her&s;elf agreeable to him: and let this brutal de&s;ire of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation be the grand &s;pring of all her actions, when it is proved to be the iron bed of fate, to fit which her character &s;hould be &s;tretched or contracted, regardle&s;s of all moral or phy&s;ical di&s;tinctions.

<P><Q>Girls are from their earlie&s;t infancy fond of dre&s;s. Not content with being pretty, they are de&s;irous of being thought &s;o; we &s;ee, by all their little airs, that this thought engages their attention; and they are hardly capable of un|der&s;tanding what is &s;aid to them, before they are to be governed by talking to them of what people will think of their behaviour. The &s;ame motive, however, indi&s;creetly made u&s;e of with boys, has not the &s;ame effect: provided they are let to pur&s;ue their amu&s;ements at plea|&s;ure, they care very little what people think of them. Time and pains are nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ub|ject boys to this motive.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Whence&s;oever girls derive this fir&s;t le&s;&s;on, it is a very good one. As the body is born, in a manner before the &s;oul, our fir&s;t concern &s;hould be to cultivate the former; this order is com|mon

to both &s;exes, but the object of that cul|tivation is different. In the one &s;ex it is the developement of corporeal powers; in the oth|er, that of per&s;onal charms: not that either the quality of &s;trength or beauty ought to be confined exclu&s;ively to one &s;ex; but only that the order of the cultivation of both is in that re&s;pect rever&s;ed. Women certainly require as much &s;trength as to enable them to move and act gracefully, and men as much addre&s;s as to qualify them to act with ea&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Children of both &s;exes have a great many amu&s;ements in common; and &s;o they ought; have they not al&s;o many &s;uch when they are grown up? Each &s;ex has al&s;o its peculiar ta&s;te to di&s;tingui&s;h in this particular. Boys love &s;ports of noi&s;e and activity; to beat the drum, to whip the top, and to drag about their little carts: girls, on the other hand, are fonder of things of &s;how and ornament; &s;uch as mirrours, trinkets, and dolls: the doll is the peculiar amu&s;ement of the females; from whence we &s;ee their ta&s;te plainly adapted to their de&s;tination. The phy&s;ical part of the art of plea&s;ing lies in dre&s;s; and this is all which children are ca|pacitated to cultivate of that art.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Here then we &s;ee a primary propen&s;ity firm|ly e&s;tabli&s;hed, which you need only pur&s;ue and
<PB N="144" REF="025054_0141_0FCDB66ACA1ABB20">
regulate. The little creature will doubtle&s;s be very de&s;irous to know how to dre&s;s up her doll, to make its &s;leeve-knots, its flounces, its head-dre&s;s, &amp;c. &s;he is obliged to have &s;o much recour&s;e to the people about her, for their a&s;|&s;i&s;tance in the&s;e articles, that it would be much more agreeable to her to owe them all to her own indu&s;try. Hence we have a good rea&s;on for the fir&s;t le&s;&s;ons that are u&s;ually taught the&s;e young females: in which we do not appear to be &s;et|ting them a ta&s;k, but obliging them, by in|&s;tructing them in what is immediately u&s;eful to them&s;elves. And, in fact, almo&s;t all of them learn with reluctance to read and write; but very readily apply them&s;elves to the u&s;e of their needles. They imagine them&s;elves already grown up, and think with plea&s;ure that &s;uch qualifica|tions will enable them to decorate them&s;elves.</Q></P>
<P>This is certainly only an education of the body; but Rou&s;&s;eau is not the only man who has indi|rectly &s;aid that merely the per&s;on of a <HI>young</HI> wo|man, without any mind, unle&s;s animal &s;pirits come under that de&s;cription, is very plea&s;ing. To render it weak, and what &s;ome may call beauti|ful, the under&s;tanding is neglected, and girls forced to &s;it &s;till, play with dolls and li&s;ten to fooli&s;h conver&s;ations;&mdash;the effect of habit is in|&s;i&s;ted upon as an undoubted indication of nature. I know it was Rou&s;&s;eau's opinion that the fir&s;t years of youth &s;hould be employed to form the body, though in educating Emilius he deviates from this plan; yet, the difference between &s;trengthening the body, on which &s;trength of mind in a great mea&s;ure depends, and only giv|ing it an ea&s;y motion, is very wide.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="025054_0142_0FCDB66C38FCB308">Rou&s;&s;eau's ob&s;ervations, it is proper to remark, were made in a country where the art of plea&s;ing was refined only to extract the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of vice. He did not go back to nature, or his ruling ap|petite di&s;turbed the operations of rea&s;on, el&s;e he would not have drawn the&s;e crude inferences.</P>
<P>In France boys and girls, particularly the lat|ter, are only educated to plea&s;e, to manage their per&s;ons, and regulate their exterior behaviour; and their minds are corrupted, at a very early age, by the worldly and pious cautions they receive to guard them again&s;t immode&s;ty. I &s;peak of pa&s;t times. The very confe&s;&s;ions which mere chil|dren were obliged to make, and the que&s;tions a&s;k|ed by the holy men, I a&s;&s;ert the&s;e facts on good authority, were &s;ufficient to impre&s;s a &s;exual cha|racter; and the education of &s;ociety was a &s;chool of coquetry and art. At the age of ten or eleven; nay, often much &s;ooner, girls began to coquet, and talked, unreproved, of e&s;tabli&s;hing them&s;elves in the world by marriage.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, they were made women, almo&s;t from their very birth, and compliments were li&s;tened to in&s;tead of in&s;truction. The&s;e, weakening the mind, Nature was &s;uppo&s;ed to have acted like a &s;tep-mother, when &s;he formed this after-thought of creation.</P>
<P>Not allowing them under&s;tanding, however, it was but con&s;i&s;tent to &s;ubject them to authority independent of rea&s;on; and to prepare them for this &s;ubjection, he gives the following advice:</P>
<P><Q>Girls ought to be active and diligent; nor is that all; they &s;hould al&s;o be early &s;ubjected to re&s;traint. This misfortune, if it really be one,
<PB N="146" REF="025054_0143_0FCDB66DCC81A518">
is in&s;eparable from their &s;ex; nor do they ever throw it off but to &s;uffer more cruel evils. They mu&s;t be &s;ubject, all their lives, to the mo&s;t con&s;tant and &s;evere re&s;traint, which is that of decorum: it is, therefore nece&s;&s;ary to accu&s;tom them early to &s;uch confinement, that it may not afterwards co&s;t them too dear; and to the &s;up|pre&s;&s;ion of their caprices, that they may the more readily &s;ubmit to the will of others. If, indeed, they are fond of being always at work, they &s;hould be &s;ometimes compelled to lay it a&s;ide. Di&s;&s;ipation, levity, and incon&s;tancy, are faults that readily &s;pring up from their fir&s;t pro|pen&s;ities, when corrupted or perverted by too much indulgence. To prevent this abu&s;e, we &s;hould learn them, above all things, to lay a due re&s;traint on them&s;elves. The life of a mode&s;t woman is reduced, by our ab&s;urd in&s;titutions, to a perpetual conflict with her&s;elf: not but it is ju&s;t that this &s;ex &s;hould partake of the &s;uffer|ings which ari&s;e from tho&s;e evils it hath cau&s;ed us.</Q></P>
<P>And why is the life of a mode&s;t woman a per|petual conflict? I &s;hould an&s;wer, that this very &s;y&s;tem of education makes it &s;o. Mode&s;ty, tem|perance, and &s;elf-denial, are the &s;ober offspring of rea&s;on; but when &s;en&s;ibility is nurtured at the expen&s;e of the under&s;tanding, &s;uch weak beings mu&s;t be re&s;trained by arbitrary means, and be &s;ub|jected to continual conflicts; but give their activ|ity of mind a wider range, and nobler pa&s;&s;ions and motives will govern their appetites and &s;en|timents.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="025054_0144_0FCDB67085B0F090">
<Q>The common attachment and regard of a mother, nay, mere habit, will make her belov|ed by her children, if &s;he does nothing to incur their hate. Even the con&s;traint &s;he lays them under, if well directed, will increa&s;e their af|fection, in&s;tead of le&s;&s;ening it; becau&s;e a &s;tate of dependence being natural to the &s;ex, they perceive them&s;elves formed for obedience.</Q></P>
<P>This is begging the que&s;tion; for &s;ervitude not only deba&s;es the individual, but its effects &s;eem to be tran&s;mitted to po&s;terity. Con&s;idering the length of time that women have been de|pendent, is it &s;urpri&s;ing that &s;ome of them hug their chains, and fawn like the &s;paniel? 'The&s;e dogs,' ob&s;erves a naturali&s;t,

<P>'For the &s;ame rea&s;on,' adds Rou&s;&s;eau,
<Q>wo|men have, or ought to have, but little liberty; they are apt to indulge them&s;elves exce&s;&s;ively in what is allowed them. Addicted in every thing to extremes, they are even more tran&s;ported at their diver&s;ions than boys.</Q></P>
<P>The an&s;wer to this is very &s;imple.

they con&s;tantly remain either under &s;ubjection to the men, or to the opinions of mankind; and are never permitted to &s;et them&s;elves above tho&s;e opinions. The fir&s;t and mo&s;t important qualification in a woman is good-nature or &s;weet|ne&s;s of temper: formed to obey a being &s;o im|perfect as man, often full of vices, and always full of faults, &s;he ought to learn betimes even to &s;uffer inju&s;tice, and to bear the in&s;ults of a hu&s;band without complaint; it is not for his &s;ake, but her own, that &s;he &s;hould be of a mild di&s;po&s;ition.

<P>Formed to live with &s;uch an imperfect being as man, they ought to learn from the exerci&s;e of their faculties the nece&s;&s;ity of forbearance; but all the &s;acred rights of humanity are violated by in&s;i&s;ting on blind obedience; or, the mo&s;t &s;a|cred rights belong <HI>only</HI> to man.</P>
<P>The being who patiently endures inju&s;tice, and &s;ilently bears in&s;ults, will &s;oon become unju&s;t, or unable to di&s;cern right from wrong.

Greatne&s;s of mind can never dwell with cunning, or addre&s;s, for I &s;hall not differ about words, when their direct &s;ignification is in&s;incerity and fal&s;ehood; but content my&s;elf with ob&s;erving, that if any cla&s;s of mankind are to be educated by rules not &s;trictly deducible from truth, virtue is an affair of convention.

<P>But, to complete the &s;ketch.
<Q>It is ea&s;y to be conceived, that if male children are not in a capacity to form any true notions of religion, tho&s;e ideas mu&s;t be greatly above the concep|tion of the females: it is for this very rea&s;on, I would begin to &s;peak to them the earlier on this &s;ubject; for if we were to wait till they were in a capacity to di&s;cu&s;s methodically &s;uch profound que&s;tions, we &s;hould run a ri&s;k of never &s;peaking to them on this &s;ubject as long as they lived. Rea&s;on in women is a practi|cal rea&s;on, capacitating them artfully to di&s;cov|er the means of attaining a known end, but which would never enable them to di&s;cover that end it&s;elf. The &s;ocial relations of the &s;exes are indeed truly admirable: from their union there re&s;ults a moral per&s;on, of which woman may be termed the eyes, and man the hand, with this dependence on each other, that it is from the man that the woman is to learn what &s;he is to &s;ee, and it is of the woman that man is to learn what he ought to do. If wo|man could recur to the fir&s;t principles of things as well as man, and man was capacitated to en|ter into their <HI>minutiae</HI> as well as woman, always <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ndependent of each other, they would live in

perpetual di&s;cord, and their union could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t.

<P><Q>As the conduct of a woman is &s;ub&s;ervient to the public opinion, her faith in matters of re|ligion &s;hould, for that very rea&s;on, be &s;ubject to authority. <HI>Every daughter ought to be of the &s;ame religion as her mother, and every wife to be of the &s;ame religion as her hu&s;band: for, though &s;uch religion &s;hould be fal&s;e, that docility which induces the mother and daughter to &s;ubmit to the order of nature, take away, in the &s;ight of God, the criminality of their error</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">What is to be the con&s;equence, if the mother's and hu&s;hand's opinion &s;hould <HI>chance</HI> not to agree?

How indeed &s;hould &s;he, when her hu&s;band is not always at hand to lend her his rea&s;on?&mdash;when they both togeth|er make but one moral being.

<P>But he returns to his unintelligible paradoxes again, when he thus addre&s;&s;es Sophia.
<Q>Emili|us, in becoming your hu&s;band, is become your ma&s;ter; and claims your obedience. Such is the order of nature. When a man is married, however, to &s;uch a wife as Sophia, it is proper he &s;hould be directed by her; this is al&s;o agreea|ble to the order of nature: it is, therefore, to give you as much authority over his heart as his &s;ex gives him over your per&s;on, that I have made you the arbiter of his plea&s;ures.

Why are women to be thus bred up with a de&s;ire of conque&s;t? the ve|ry epithet, u&s;ed in this &s;en&s;e, gives me a &s;ickly qualm!

<P>Idle empty words! What can &s;uch delu&s;ive flattery lead to, but vanity and folly? The lover, it is true, has a poetic licence to exalt his mi&s;|tre&s;s; his rea&s;on is the bubble of his pa&s;&s;ion, and

<P>In &s;ermons or novels, however, voluptuou&s;|ne&s;s is always true to its text.

<P>His ea&s;y familiar &s;tyle is particularly &s;uited to the tenor of his advice, and the melancholy ten|derne&s;s which his re&s;pect for the memory of a be|loved wife, diffu&s;es through the whole work, ren|ders it very intere&s;ting; yet there is a degree of conci&s;e elegance con&s;picuous in many pa&s;&s;ages that di&s;turbs this &s;ympathy; and we pop on the author, when we only expected to meet the&mdash; father.</P>

<P>In the preface he tells them a mournful truth,
<Q>that they will hear, at lea&s;t once in their lives, the genuine &s;entiments of a man who has no in|tere&s;t in deceiving them.</Q></P>
<P>Haple&s;s woman! what can be expected from thee when the beings on whom thou art &s;aid na|turally to depend for rea&s;on and &s;upport, have all an intere&s;t in deceiving thee! This is the root of the evil that has &s;hed a corroding mildew on all thy virtues; and blighting in the bud thy open|ing faculties, has rendered thee the weak thing thou art! It is this &s;eparate intere&s;t&mdash;this in|&s;idious &s;tate of warfare, that undermines mo|rality, and divides mankind!</P>
<P>If love have made &s;ome women wretched&mdash; how many more has the cold unmeaning inter|cour&s;e of gallantry rendered vain and u&s;ele&s;s! yet this heartle&s;s attention to the &s;ex is reckoned &s;o manly, &s;o polite, that till &s;ociety is very differ|ently organized, I fear, this ve&s;tige of gothic man|ners will not be done away by a more rea&s;onable and affectionate mode of conduct. Be&s;ides, to &s;trip it of its imaginary dignity, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that in the mo&s;t uncivilized European &s;tates this lip-&s;ervice prevails in a very great degree, accom|panied with extreme di&s;&s;olutene&s;s of morals. In Portugal, the country that I particularly allude to, it takes place of the mo&s;t &s;erious moral obli|gations; for a man is &s;eldom a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated when in the company of a woman.

<P>The remarks relative to behaviour, though many of them very &s;en&s;ible, I entirely di&s;approve of, becau&s;e it appears to me to be beginning, as it were, at the wrong end. A cultivated under|&s;tanding, and an affectionate heart, will never want &s;tarched rules of decorum&mdash;&s;omething more &s;ub&s;tantial than &s;eemline&s;s will be the re&s;ult; and, without under&s;tanding the behaviour here recommended, would be rank affectation. De|corum, indeed, is the one thing needful!&mdash;deco|rum is to &s;upplant nature, and bani&s;h all &s;impli|city and variety of character out of the female world. Yet what good end can all this &s;uperfi|cial coun&s;el produce? It is, however, much ea&s;i|er to point out this or that mode of behaviour, than to &s;et the rea&s;on to work; but, when the mind has been &s;tored with u&s;eful knowledge, and &s;trengthened by being employed, the regulation of the behaviour may &s;afely be left to its guid|ance.</P>

<P><Q>The &s;entiment that a woman may allow all innocent freedoms, provided her virtue is &s;e|cure, is both gro&s;sly indelicate and dangerous, and has proved fatal to many of your &s;ex.</Q>
With this opinion I perfectly coincide. A man, or a women, of any feeling, mu&s;t always wi&s;h to con|vince a beloved object that it is the care&s;&s;es of the individual, not the &s;ex, that is received and re|turned with plea&s;ure; and that the heart, rather than the &s;en&s;es, is moved. Without this natural delicacy, love becomes a &s;elfi&s;h per&s;onal gratifi|cation that &s;oon degrades the character.</P>
<P>I carry this &s;entiment &s;till further. Affec|tion, when love is out of the que&s;tion, authori&s;es many per&s;onal endearments, that naturally flow|ing from an innocent heart, give life to the behav|iour; but the per&s;onal intercour&s;e of appetite, gallantry, or vanity, is de&s;picable. When a man &s;queezes the hand of a pretty woman, handing her to a carriage, whom he has never &s;een before, &s;he will con&s;ider &s;uch an impertinent freedom in the light of an in&s;ult, if &s;he have any true delica|cy, in&s;tead of being flattered by this unmeaning homage to beauty.

a few comments. 'Though Rou&s;&s;eau,' &s;he ob|&s;erves,
<Q>has endeavoured to prevent women from interfering in public affairs, and acting a bril|liant part in the theatre of politics; yet in &s;peak|ing of them, how much has he done it to their &s;atisfaction! If he wi&s;hed to deprive them of &s;ome rights foreign to their &s;ex, how has he for ever re&s;tored to them all tho&s;e to which it has a claim? And in attempting to dimini&s;h their influence over the deliberations of men, how &s;acredly has he e&s;tabli&s;hed the empire they have over their happine&s;s! In aiding them to de&s;cend from an u&s;urped throne, he has firmly &s;eated them upon that to which they were de&s;|tined by nature; and though he be full of in|dignation again&s;t them when they endeavour to re&s;emble men, yet when they come before him with all the <HI>charms, weakne&s;&s;es, virtues</HI> and <HI>errors,</HI> of their &s;ex, his re&s;pect for their per&s;ons amounts almo&s;t to adoration.</Q>
True!&mdash;For never was there a &s;en&s;uali&s;t who paid more fer|vent adoration at the &s;hrine of beauty. So de|vout, indeed, was his re&s;pect for the per&s;on, that excepting the virtue of cha&s;tity, for obvious rea|&s;ons, he only wi&s;hed to &s;ee it embelli&s;hed by charms, weakne&s;&s;es, and errors. He was afraid le&s;t the au&s;terity of rea&s;on &s;hould di&s;turb the &s;oft playfulne&s;s of love. The ma&s;ter wi&s;hed to have a meretricious &s;lave to fondle, entirely dependent on his rea&s;on and bounty; he did not want a com|panion, whom he &s;hould be compelled to e&s;teem, or a friend to whom he could confide the care of his children's education, &s;hould death deprive them of their father, before he had fulfilled the
<PB N="183" REF="025054_0180_0FCDB6C4CFCA8E88">
&s;acred ta&s;k. He denies woman rea&s;on, &s;huts her out from knowledge, and turns her a&s;ide from truth; yet his pardon is granted, becau&s;e 'he admits the pa&s;&s;ion of love.' It would require &s;ome ingenuity to &s;hew why women were to be under &s;uch an obligation to him for thus admit|ting love; when it is clear that he admits it only for the relaxation of men, and to perpetuate the &s;pecies; but he talked with pa&s;&s;ion, and that powerful &s;pell worked on the &s;en&s;ibility of a young encomia&s;t. 'What &s;ignifies it,' pur&s;ues this rhap&s;odi&s;t,
<Q>to women, that his rea&s;on di&s;|putes with them the empire, when his heart is devotedly theirs.</Q>
It is not empire,&mdash;but equal|ity, that they &s;hould contend for. Yet, if they only wi&s;hed to lengthen out their &s;way, they &s;hould not entirely tru&s;t to their per&s;ons, for though beauty may gain a heart, it cannot keep it, even while the beauty is in full bloom, unle&s;s the mind lend, at lea&s;t, &s;ome graces.</P>
<P>When women are once &s;ufficiently enlightened to di&s;cover their real intere&s;t, on a grand &s;cale, they will, I am per&s;uaded, be very ready to re&s;ign all the prerogatives of love, that are not mutual, &s;peaking of them as la&s;ting prerogatives, for the calm &s;atisfaction of friend&s;hip, and the tender confidence of habitual e&s;teem. Before marriage they will not a&s;&s;ume any in&s;olent airs, nor after|wards abjectly &s;ubmit; but endeavouring to act like rea&s;onable creatures, in both &s;ituations, they will not be tumbled from a throne to a &s;tool.</P>

<P>She tells a &s;tory of a young man engaged by his father's expre&s;s de&s;ire to a girl of fortune. Before the marriage could take place, &s;he is de|prived of her fortune, and thrown friendle&s;s on the world.

<P>Many &s;imilar opinions occur in her writings, mixed with &s;entiments that do honour to her head and heart. Yet &s;o much &s;uper&s;tition is mixed with her religion, and &s;o much worldly wi&s;dom with her morality, that I &s;hould not let a young per&s;on read her works, unle&s;s I could af|terwards conver&s;e on the &s;ubjects, and point out the contradictions.</P>
<P>Mrs. Chapone's Letters are written with &s;uch good &s;en&s;e, and unaffected humility, and contain &s;o many u&s;eful ob&s;ervations, that I only mention them to pay the worthy writer this tribute of re|&s;pect. I cannot, it is true, always coincide in opinion with her; but I always re&s;pect her.</P>
<P>The very word re&s;pect brings Mrs. Macaulay to my remembrance. The woman of the great|e&s;t abilities, undoubtedly, that this country has ever produced.&mdash;And yet this woman has been &s;uffered to die without &s;ufficient re&s;pect being paid to her memory.</P>
<P>Po&s;terity, however, will be more ju&s;t; and re|member that Catharine Macaulay was an exam|ple of intellectual acquirements &s;uppo&s;ed to be incompatible with the weakne&s;s of her &s;ex.

<P>I will not call her's a ma&s;culine under&s;tanding, becau&s;e I admit not of &s;uch an arrogant a&s;&s;ump|tion of rea&s;on; but I contend that it was a &s;ound one, and that her judgment, the matured fruit of
<PB N="186" REF="025054_0183_0FCDB6CE49B51B80">

Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing more penetration than &s;agacity, more under&s;tanding than fancy, &s;he writes with &s;ober energy and argumentative clo&s;ene&s;s; yet &s;ympathy and benevolence give an intere&s;t to her &s;entiments, and that vital heat to arguments, which forces the reader to weigh them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Coinciding in opinion with Mrs. Macaulay relative to many branches of education, I refer to her valuable work, in&s;tead of quoting her &s;entiments to &s;upport my own.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>In the world few people act from principle; pre&s;ent feelings, and early habits, are the grand &s;prings: but how would the former be deaden|ed, and the latter rendered iron corroding fetters, if the world were &s;hewn to young people ju&s;t as it is; when no knowledge of mankind or their own hearts, &s;lowly obtained by experience, ren|dered them forbearing?

<P>It is natural for youth to adorn the fir&s;t object of its affection with every good quality, and the emulation produced by ignorance, or, to &s;peak with more propriety, by inexperience, brings for|ward the mind capable of forming &s;uch an af|fection, and when, in the lap&s;e of time, perfec|tion is found not to be within the reach of mor|tals, virtue, ab&s;tractedly, is thought beautiful, and wi&s;dom &s;ublime. Admiration then gives place to friend&s;hip, properly &s;o called, becau&s;e it is ce|mented by e&s;teem; and the being walks alone only dependent on heaven for that emulous pant|ing after perfection which ever glows in a noble mind. But this knowledge a man mu&s;t gain by the exertion of his own faculties; and this is &s;urely the ble&s;&s;ed fruit of di&s;appointed hope! for He who delighteth to diffu&s;e happine&s;s and &s;hew mercy to the weak creatures, who are learning to know him, never implanted a good propen&s;ity to be a tormenting ignis fatuus.</P>

I mean, therefore, to infer&punc; that we ought to have a preci&s;e idea of what we wi&s;h to attain by education, for the immortality of the &s;oul is contradicted by the actions of many people who firmly profe&s;s the belief.</P>

<P>Let me now as from an eminence &s;urvey the world &s;tripped of all its fal&s;e delu&s;ive charms. The clear atmo&s;phere enables me to &s;ee each object in its true point of view, while my heart is &s;till. I am calm as the pro&s;pect in a morning when the mi&s;ts, &s;lowly di&s;per&s;ing, &s;ilently unveil the beauties of nature, refre&s;hed by re&s;t.</P>
<P>In what light will the world now appear?&mdash;I rub my eyes and think, perchance, that I am ju&s;t awaking from a lively dream.</P>
<P>I &s;ee the &s;ons and daughters of men pur&s;uing &s;hadows, and anxiou&s;ly wa&s;ting their powers to feed pa&s;&s;ions which have no adequate object&mdash;if the very exce&s;s of the&s;e blind impul&s;es, pampered by that lying, yet con&s;tantly tru&s;ted guide, the imagination, did not, by preparing them for &s;ome other &s;tate, render &s;hort-&s;ighted mortals wi&s;er without their own concurrence; or, what comes to the &s;ame thing, when they were pur&s;uing &s;ome imaginary pre&s;ent good.</P>
<P>After viewing objects in this light, it would not be very fanciful to imagine that this world was a &s;tage on which a pantomime is daily per|formed for the amu&s;ement of &s;uperiour beings. How would they be diverted to &s;ee the ambitious man con&s;uming him&s;elf by running after a phan|tom, and,
<Q>pur&s;uing the bubble &s;ame in the can|non's mouth</Q>
that was to blow him to nothing: for when con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s is lo&s;t, it matters not whether we mount in a whirlwind or de&s;cend in rain. And &s;hould they compa&s;&s;ionately invigo|rate his &s;ight and &s;hew him the thorny path

which led to eminence, that like a quick&s;and &s;inks as he a&s;cends, di&s;appointing his hopes when almo&s;t within his gra&s;p, would he not leave to others the honour of amu&s;ing them, and labour to &s;ecure the pre&s;ent moment, though from the con&s;titution of his nature he would not find it very ea&s;y to catch the &s;lying &s;tream? Such &s;laves are we to hope and fear!</P>
<P>But, vain as the ambitious man's pur&s;uits would be, he is often &s;triving for &s;omething more &s;ub&s;tantial than fame&mdash;that indeed would be the verie&s;t meteor, the wilde&s;t fire that could lure a man to ruin.&mdash;What! renounce the mo&s;t trifling gratification to be applauded when he &s;hould be no more!

<P>And love! What diverting &s;cenes would it produce&mdash;Pantaloon's tricks mu&s;t yield to more egregious folly. To &s;ee a mortal adorn an ob|ject with imaginary charms, and then fall down and wor&s;hip the idol which he had him&s;elf &s;et up&mdash;how ridiculous! But what &s;erious con&s;e|quences en&s;ue to rob man of that portion of hap|pine&s;s, which the Deity by calling him into ex|i&s;tence has (or, on what can his attributes re&s;t?) indubitably promi&s;ed: would not all the purpo|&s;es of life have been much better fulfilled if he had only felt what has been termed phy&s;ical love? And, would not the &s;ight of the object, not &s;een through the medium of the imagination, &s;oon re|duce the pa&s;&s;ion to an appetite, if reflection, the noble di&s;tinction of man, did not give it force, and make it an in&s;trument to rai&s;e him above this

<P>The habit of reflection, and the knowledge at|tained by fo&s;tering any pa&s;&s;ion, might be &s;hewn to be equally u&s;eful, though the object be proved equally fallacious; for they would all appeal in the &s;ame light, if they were not magnified by the governing pa&s;&s;ion implanted in us by the Author of all good, to call forth and &s;trengthen the fac|ulties of each individual, and enable it to attain all the experience that an infant can obtain, who does certain things, it cannot tell why.</P>
<P>I de&s;cend from my height, and mixing with my fellow-creatures, feel my&s;elf hurried along the common &s;tream; ambition, love, hope and fear, exert their wonted power, though we be con|vinced by rea&s;on that their pre&s;ent and mo&s;t at|tractive promi&s;es are only lying dreams; but had the cold hand of circum&s;pection damped each generous feeling before it had left any permanent character, or fixed &s;ome habit, what could be ex|pected, but &s;elfi&s;h prudence and rea&s;on ju&s;t ri&s;ing above in&s;tinct? Who that has read Dean Swift's di&s;gu&s;ting de&s;cription of the Yahoos, and in&s;ipid one of Houyhnhnm with a philo&s;ophical eye, can avoid &s;eeing the futility of degrading the pa&s;&s;ions, or making man re&s;t in contentment?</P>

his head than his heart, could produce nothing great, and his under&s;tanding, prepared for this world, would not, by its noble flights, prove that it had a title to a better.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, it is not po&s;&s;ible to give a young per|&s;on a ju&s;t view of life; he mu&s;t have &s;truggled with his own pa&s;&s;ions before he can e&s;timate the force of the temptation which betrayed his bro|ther into vice.

<P>When we hear of &s;ome daring crime, it comes full on us in the deepe&s;t &s;hade of turpitude, and rai&s;es indignation; but the eye that gradually &s;aw the darkne&s;s thicken, mu&s;t ob&s;erve it with more com|pa&s;&s;ionate forbearance. The world cannot be &s;een by an unmoved &s;pectator, we mu&s;t mix in the throng, and feel as men feel before we can judge of their feelings. If we mean, in &s;hort, to live in the world to grow wi&s;er and better, and not merely to enjoy the good things of life, we mu&s;t attain a knowledge of others at the &s;ame time that we become acquainted with our&s;elves&mdash; knowledge acquired any other way only hardens the heart and perplexes the under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>I may be told, that the knowledge thus ac|quired, is &s;ometimes purcha&s;ed at too dear a rate.

<P>I have ob&s;erved that young people, to who&s;e education particular attention has been paid, have, in general, been very &s;uperficial and conceited, and far from plea&s;ing in any re&s;pect, becau&s;e they had neither the un&s;u&s;pecting warmth of youth, nor the cool depth of age. I cannot help im|puting this unnatural appearance principally to that ha&s;ty premature in&s;truction, which leads them pre&s;umptuou&s;ly to repeat all the crude no|tions they have taken upon tru&s;t, &s;o that the care|ful education which they received, makes them all their lives the &s;laves of prejudices.</P>
<P>Mental as well as bodily exertion is, at fir&s;t, irk&s;ome; &s;o much &s;o, that the many would fain let others both work and think for them. An ob&s;ervation which I have often made will illu&s;|trate my meaning. When in a circle of &s;trang|ers, or acquaintances, a per&s;on of moderate abil|ities a&s;&s;erts an opinion with heat, I will venture to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ffirm, for I have traced this fact home, very often, that it is a prejudice.

<P>I know that a kind of fa&s;hion now prevails of re&s;pecting prejudices; and when any one dares to face them, though actuated by humanity and arm|ed by rea&s;on, he is &s;uperciliou&s;ly a&s;ked whether his ance&s;tors were fools. No, I &s;hould reply;

But, mo&s;s-covered opinions a&s;&s;ume the di&s;pro|portioned form of prejudices, when they are in|dolently adopted only becau&s;e age has given them a venerable a&s;pect, though the rea&s;on on which they were built cea&s;es to be a rea&s;on, or cannot be traced.

A prejudice is a fond ob&s;tinate per&s;ua&s;ion for which we can give no rea&s;on; for the moment a rea&s;on can be given for an opinion, it cea&s;es to be a prejudice, though it may be an error in judgment: and are we then advi&s;ed to cheri&s;h opinions only to &s;et rea&s;on at defiance? This mode of arguing, if arguing it may be called, reminds me of what is vulgarly termed a woman's rea&s;on.

<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to conver&s;e with people to any purpo&s;e, who, in this &s;tyle only u&s;e affirmatives and negatives. Before you can bring them to a point, to &s;tart fairly from, you mu&s;t go back to the &s;imple principles that were antecedent to the prejudices broached by power; and it is ten to one but you are &s;topped by the philo&s;ophical a&s;|&s;ertion, that certain principles are as practically fal&s;e as they are ab&s;tractly true<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><L>'Convince a man again&s;t his will,</L>

<P>The fact is, that men expect from education, what education cannot give.

The bu&s;ine&s;s of education in this ca&s;e, is only to con|duct the &s;hooting tendrils to a proper pole; yet after laying precept upon precept, without allow|ing a child to acquire judgment it&s;elf, parents expect them to act in the &s;ame manner by this borrowed fallacious light, as if they had illumi|nated, it them&s;elves; and be, when they enter life, what their parents are at the clo&s;e.

<P>There appears to be &s;omething analogous in the mind. The &s;en&s;es and the imagination give a form to the character, during childhood and youth; and the under&s;tanding, as life advances, gives firmne&s;s to the fir&s;t fair purpo&s;es of &s;en&s;i|bility &mdash;till virtue, ari&s;ing rather from the clear conviction of rea&s;on than the impul&s;e of the heart, morality is made to re&s;t on a rock again&s;t which the &s;torms of pa&s;&s;ion vainly beat.</P>
<P>I hope I &s;hall not be mi&s;under&s;tood when I &s;ay, that religion will not have this conden&s;ing energy, unle&s;s it be founded on rea&s;on.

The religion which con|&s;i&s;ts in warming the affections, and exalting the imagination, is only the poetical part, and may afford the individual plea&s;ure without rendering it a more moral being. It may be a &s;ub&s;titute for worldly pur&s;uits; yet narrow, in&s;tead of en|larging the heart: but virtue mu&s;t be loved as in it&s;elf &s;ublime and excellent, and not for the advantages it procures or the evils it averts, if any great degree of excellence be expected.

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. THE EFFECT WHICH AN EARLY ASSOCIA|TION OF IDEAS HAS UPON THE CHARAC|TER.</HEAD>
<P>EDUCATED in the enervating &s;tyle re|commended by the writers on whom I have been animadverting; and not having a chance, from their &s;ubordinate &s;tate in &s;ociety, to recover their lo&s;t ground, is it &s;urpri&s;ing that women every where appear a defect in nature? Is it &s;urpri&s;ing, when we con&s;ider what a determinate effect an early a&s;&s;ociation of ideas has on the character, that they, neglect their under&s;tandings, and turn all their attention to their per&s;ons?</P>
<P>The great advantages which naturally re&s;ult from &s;toring the mind with knowledge, are ob|vious from the following con&s;iderations. The a&s;&s;ociation of our ideas is either habitual or in|&s;tantaneous; and the latter mode &s;eems rather to depend on the original temperature of the mind than on the will. When the ideas, and matters of fact, are once taken in, they lie by for u&s;e, till &s;ome fortuitous circum&s;tance makes the information dart into the mind with illu&s;trative force, that has been received at very different pe|riods of our lives. Like the lightning's fla&s;h are many recollections; one idea a&s;&s;imilating and ex|plaining another, with a&s;toni&s;hing rapidity. I do not now allude to that quick perception of truth, which is &s;o intuitive that it baffles re&s;earch, and
<PB N="204" REF="025054_0201_0FCDB6EC83742F90">
makes us at a lo&s;s to determine whether it is re|mini&s;cence or ratiocination, lo&s;t &s;ight of in its ce|lerity, that opens the dark cloud. Over tho&s;e in&s;tantaneous a&s;&s;ociations we have little power; for when the mind is once enlarged by excur&s;ive flights, or profound reflection, the raw materials will, in &s;ome degree, arrange them&s;elves. The under&s;tanding, it is true, may keep us from going out of drawing when we group our thoughts, or tran&s;cribe from the imagination the warm &s;ketch|es of fancy; but the animal &s;pirits, the individu|al character, give the colouring. Over this &s;ub|tile electric fluid<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have &s;ometimes, when inclined to laugh at materiali&s;ts, a&s;ked whe|ther, as the mo&s;t powerful effects in nature, are apparently produced by fluids, the magnetic, &amp;c. the pa&s;&s;ions might not be fine volatile fluids that embraced humanity, keeping the more refractory elementary parts togeth|er &mdash;or whether they were &s;imply a liquid fire that pervaded the more dug|gi&s;h materials, giving them life and heat?</NOTE>, how little power do we po&s;|&s;e&s;s, and over it how little power can rea&s;on ob|tain! The&s;e fine intractable &s;pirits appear to be the e&s;&s;ence of genius, and beaming in its eagle eye, produce in the mo&s;t eminent degree the hap|py energy of a&s;&s;ociating thoughts that &s;urpri&s;e, delight, and in&s;truct. The&s;e are the glowing minds that concentrate pictures for their fellow-creatures; forcing them to view with intere&s;t the objects reflected from the impa&s;&s;ioned imagina|tion, which they pa&s;&s;ed over in nature.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t be allowed to explain my&s;elf. The generality of people cannot &s;ee or feel poetically, they want fancy, and therefore fly from &s;olitude in &s;earch of &s;en&s;ible objects; but when an author lends them his eyes they can &s;ee as he &s;aw, and be amu&s;ed by images they could not &s;elect, though lying before them.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="025054_0202_0FCDB6F0D43BFA38">Education thus only &s;upplies the man of gen|ius with knowledge to give variety and contra&s;t to his a&s;&s;ociations; but there is an habitual a&s;|&s;ociation of ideas, that grows 'with our growth,' which has a great effect on the moral character of mankind; and by which a turn is given to the mind that commonly remains throughout life. So ductile is the under&s;tanding, and yet &s;o &s;tubborn, that the a&s;&s;ociations which depend on adventitious circum&s;tances, during the period that the body takes to arrive at maturity, can &s;eldom be di&s;entangled by rea&s;on. One idea calls up another, its old a&s;&s;ociate, and memory, faithful to the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions, particularly when the in|tellectual powers are not employed to cool our &s;en&s;ations, retraces them with mechanical exact|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>This habitual &s;lavery, to fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions, has a more baneful effect on the female than the male character, becau&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s and other dry employ|ments of the under&s;tanding, tend to deaden the feelings and break a&s;&s;ociations that do violence to rea&s;on.

<P>Every thing that they &s;ee or hear &s;erves to fix impre&s;&s;ions, call forth emotions, and a&s;&s;ociate ideas, that give a &s;exual character to the mind.

weakened by being employed in unfolding in&s;tead of examining the fir&s;t a&s;&s;ociations, forced on them by every &s;urrounding object, how can they attain the vigour nece&s;&s;ary to enable them to throw off their factitious character?&mdash;where find &s;trength to recur to rea&s;on and ri&s;e &s;uperiour to a &s;y&s;tem of oppre&s;&s;ion, that bla&s;ts the fair promi&s;es of &s;pring? This cruel a&s;&s;ociation of ideas, which every thing con&s;pires to twi&s;t into all their habits of thinking, or, to &s;peak with more preci&s;ion, of feeling, receives new force when they begin to act a little for them&s;elves; for they then perceive that it is only through their addre&s;s to excite emotions in men, that plea&s;ure and power are to be obtained. Be&s;ides, all the books profe&s;&s;edly written for their in&s;truction, which make the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion on their minds, all inculcate the &s;ame opinions.

why &s;hould they be bitterly cen&s;ured for &s;eeking a congenial mind, and preferring a rake to a man of &s;en&s;e?</P>
<P>Rakes know how to work on their &s;en&s;ibility, whil&s;t the mode&s;t merit of rea&s;onable men has, of cour&s;e, le&s;s effect on their feelings, and they cannot reach the heart by the way of the under|&s;tanding, becau&s;e they have few &s;entiments in common.</P>
<P>It &s;eems a little ab&s;urd to expect women to be more rea&s;onable than men in their <HI>likings,</HI> and &s;till to deny them the uncontrolled u&s;e of rea&s;on. When do men <HI>fall-in-love</HI> with &s;en&s;e? When do they, with their &s;uperiour powers and advanta|ges, turn from the per&s;on to the mind? And how can they then expect women, who are only taught to ob&s;erve behaviour, and acquire manners rather than morals, to de&s;pi&s;e what they have been all their lives labouring to attain? Where are they &s;uddenly to find judgment enough to weigh pa|tiently the &s;en&s;e of an awkward virtuous man, when his manners, of which they are made criti|cal judges, are rebuffing, and his conver&s;ation cold and dull, becau&s;e it does not con&s;i&s;t of pretty re|partees, or well turned compliments? In order to admire or e&s;teem any thing for a continuance, we mu&s;t, at lea&s;t, have our curio&s;ity excited by knowing, in &s;ome degree, what we admire; for we are unable to e&s;timate the value of qualities and virtues above our comprehen&s;ion. Such a re&s;pect, when it is felt, may be very &s;ublime; and the confu&s;ed con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of humility may

render the dependent creature an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tere&s;ting ob|ject, in &s;ome points of view; but human love mu&s;t have gro&s;&s;er ingredients; and the per&s;on very naturally will come in for its &s;hare&mdash;and, an ample &s;hare it mo&s;tly has!</P>
<P>Love is, in a great degree, an arbitrary pa&s;&s;ion, and will reign, like &s;ome other &s;talking mi&s;chiefs, by its own authority, without deigning to rea|&s;on; and it may al&s;o be ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed from e&s;teem, the foundation of friend&s;hip, becau&s;e it is often excited by evane&s;cent beauties and graces, though to give an energy to the &s;entiment, &s;ome|thing more &s;olid mu&s;t deepen their impre&s;&s;ion and &s;et the imagination to work, to make the mo&s;t fair&mdash;the fir&s;t good.</P>
<P>Common pa&s;&s;ions are excited by common qualities.&mdash;Men look for beauty and the &s;imper of good-humoured docility: women are capti|vated by ea&s;y manners; a gentleman-like man &s;eldom fails to plea&s;e them, and their thir&s;ty ears eagerly drink the in&s;inuating nothings of polite|ne&s;s, whil&s;t they turn from the unintelligible &s;ounds of the charmer&mdash;rea&s;on, charm he never &s;o wi&s;ely. With re&s;pect to &s;uperficial accom|pli&s;hments, the rake certainly has the advantage; and of the&s;e females can form an opinion, for it is their own ground. Rendered gay and giddy by the whole tenor of their lives, the very a&s;pect of wi&s;dom, or the &s;evere graces of virtue, mu&s;t have a lugubrious appearance to them; and pro|duce a kind of re&s;traint from which they and love, &s;portive child, naturally revolt. Without ta&s;te, excepting of the lighter kind, for ta&s;te is the offspring of judgment, how can they di&s;cover
<PB N="209" REF="025054_0206_0FCDB6F88002CAD8">
that true beauty and grace mu&s;t ari&s;e from the play of the mind? and how can they be expect|ed to reli&s;h in a lover what they do not, or very imperfectly, po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves? The &s;ympathy that unites hearts, and invites to confidence, in them is &s;o very faint, that it cannot take fire, and thus mount to pa&s;&s;ion. No, I repeat it, the love cheri&s;hed by &s;uch minds, mu&s;t have gro&s;&s;er fuel.</P>
<P>The inference is obvious; till women are led to exerci&s;e their under&s;tandings, they &s;hould not be &s;atirized for their attachment to rakes; nor even for being rakes at heart, when it appears to be the inevitable con&s;equence of their education. They who live to plea&s;e&mdash;mu&s;t find their enjoy|ments, their happine&s;s, in plea&s;ure! It is a trite, yet true remark, that we never do any thing well, unle&s;s we love it for its own &s;ake.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing, however, for a moment, that wo|men were, in &s;ome future revolution of time, to become, what I &s;incerely wi&s;h them to be, even love would acquire more &s;erious dignity, and be purified in its own fires; and virtue giving true delicacy to their affections, they would turn with di&s;gu&s;t from a rake. Rea&s;oning then, as well as feeling, the only province of woman, at pre&s;ent, they might ea&s;ily guard again&s;t exteriour graces, and quickly learn to de&s;pi&s;e the &s;en&s;ibility that had been excited and hackneyed in the ways of wo|men, who&s;e trade was vice; and allurements, wanton airs. They would recollect that the flame, one mu&s;t u&s;e appropriated expre&s;&s;ions, which they wi&s;hed to light up, had been ex|hau&s;ted by lu&s;t, and that the &s;ated appetite lo&s;ing all reli&s;h for pure and &s;imple plea&s;ures, could only

be rou&s;ed by licentious arts or variety. What &s;atisfaction could a woman of delicacy promi&s;e her&s;elf in a union with &s;uch a man, when the very artle&s;&s;ne&s;s of her affection might appear in|&s;iped? Thus does Dryden de&s;cribe the &s;ituation,
<Q><L>&mdash;'Where love it duty, on the female &s;ide,</L>
<L>'On theirs mere &s;en&s;ual gu&s;t, and &s;ought with &s;urly pride.'</L></Q></P>
<P>But one grand truth women have yet to learn, though much it imports them to act according|ly. In the choice of a hu&s;band, they &s;hould not be led a&s;tray by the qualities of a lover&mdash;for a lov|er the hu&s;band, even &s;uppo&s;ing him to be wife and virtuous, cannot long remain.</P>
<P>Were women more rationally educated, could they take a more comprehen&s;ive view of things, they would be contented to love but once in their lives; and after marriage calmly let pa&s;&s;ion &s;ub|&s;ide into friend&s;hip&mdash;into that tender intimacy, which is the be&s;t refuge from care; yet is built on &s;uch pure, &s;till affections, that idle jealou&s;ies would not be allowed to di&s;turb the di&s;charge of the &s;ober duties of life, nor to engro&s;s the thoughts that ought to be otherwi&s;e employed. This is a &s;tate in which many men live&punc; but few, very few women. And the difference may ea&s;ily be accounted for, without recurring to a &s;exual character. Men, for whom we are told women were made, have too much occupied the thoughts of women; and this a&s;&s;ociation ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> entangled love with all their motives of action and, to harp a little on an old &s;tring, having been &s;olely employed either to prepare them&s;elves to excite love, or actually putting their le&s;&s;ons in

practice, they cannot live without love. But, when a &s;en&s;e of duty, or fear of &s;hame, obliges them to re&s;train this pampered de&s;ire of plea&s;ing beyond certain lengths, too far for delicacy, it is true, though far from criminality, they ob&s;tinate|ly determine to love, I &s;peak of the pa&s;&s;ion, their hu&s;bands to the end of the chapter&mdash;and then acting the part which they fooli&s;hly exacted from their lovers, they become object woers, and fond &s;laves.</P>
<P>Men of wit and fancy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e often rakes&punc; and fan|cy is the food of love. Such men will in&s;pire pa&s;&s;ion. Half the &s;ex, in its pre&s;ent infantile &s;tate, would pine for a Lovelace; a man &s;o wit|ty, &s;o graceful, and &s;o valiant: and can they <HI>de|&s;erve</HI> blame for acting according to principles &s;o con&s;tantly inculcated? They want a lover, and protector; and, behold him kneeling before them &mdash;bravery pro&s;trate to beauty! The virtues of a hu&s;band are thus thrown by love into the back ground, and gay hopes, or lively emotions, ban|i&s;h reflection till the day of reckoning comes; and come it &s;urely will, to turn the &s;prightly lover into a &s;urly &s;u&s;picious tyrant, who con|temptuou&s;ly in&s;ults the very weakne&s;s he fo&s;ter|ed. Or, &s;uppo&s;ing the rake reformed, he can|not quickly get rid of old habits. When a man of abilities is fir&s;t carried away by his pa&s;&s;ions, it is nece&s;&s;ary that &s;entiment and ta&s;te varni&s;h the enormities of vice, and give a ze&s;t to brutal in|dulgences; but when the glo&s;s of novelty is worn off, and plea&s;ure palls upon the &s;en&s;e, la&s;|civiou&s;ne&s;s becomes barefaced, and enjoyment on|ly the de&s;perate effort of weakne&s;s flying from re|flection

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. MODESTY.&mdash;COMPREHENSIVELY CONSIDER|ED, AND NOT AS A SEXUAL VIRTUE.</HEAD>
<P>MODESTY! Sacred offspring of &s;en&s;ibility and rea&s;on!&mdash;true delicacy of mind!&mdash;may I unblamed pre&s;ume to inve&s;tigate thy nature, and trace to its covert the mild charm, that mellow|ing each har&s;h feature of a character renders what would otherwi&s;e only in&s;pire cold admira|tion &mdash;lovely!&mdash;Thou that &s;moothe&s;t the wrin|kles of wi&s;dom, and &s;oftene&s;t the tone of the &s;ublime&s;t virtues till they all melt into humani|ty; &mdash;thou that &s;preade&s;t the ethereal cloud that &s;urrounding love heightens every beauty, it half &s;hades, breathing tho&s;e coy &s;weets that &s;teal into the heart, and charm the &s;en&s;es&mdash;modulate for me the language of per&s;ua&s;ive rea&s;on, till I rou&s;e my &s;ex from the flowery bed, on which they &s;u|pinely &s;leep life away!</P>
<P>In &s;peaking of the a&s;&s;ociation of our ideas, I have noticed two di&s;tinct modes, and in defining mode&s;ty, it appears to me equally proper to di&s;|criminate that purity of mind, which is the ef|fect of cha&s;tity, from a &s;implicity of character that leads us to form a ju&s;t opinion of our&s;elves, equally di&s;tant from vanity or pre&s;umption, though by no means incompatible with a lofty con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of our own dignity. Mode&s;ty, in the latter &s;ignification of the term, is, that &s;ober|ne&s;s of mind which teaches a man not to think more highly of him&s;elf than he ought to think,
<PB N="214" REF="025054_0211_0FCDB705365E55C0">
and &s;hould be di&s;tingui&s;hed from humility, be|cau&s;e humility is a kind of &s;elf-aba&s;ement.</P>
<P>A mode&s;t, man often conceives a great plain, and tenaciou&s;ly adheres to it, con&s;cious of his own &s;trength, till &s;ucce&s;s gives it a &s;anction that determines its character. Milton was not arro|gant when he &s;uffered a &s;ugge&s;tion of judgment to e&s;cape him that proved a prophe&s;y; nor was General Wa&s;hington when he accepted of the command of the American forces. The latter has always been characterized as a mode&s;t man; but had he been merely humble, he would pro|bably have &s;hrunk back irre&s;olute, afraid of tru&s;t|ing to him&s;elf the direction of an enterpri&s;e, on which &s;o much depended.</P>
<P>A mode&s;t man is &s;teady, an humble man timid, and a vain one pre&s;umptious:&mdash;this is the judg|ment, which the ob&s;ervation of many characters, has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed me to form. Je&s;us Chri&s;t was mode&s;t, Mo&s;es was humble, and Peter vain.</P>
<P>Thus, di&s;criminating mode&s;ty from humility in one ca&s;e, I do not mean to confound it with ba&s;hfulne&s;s in the other. Ba&s;hfulne&s;s, in fact, is &s;o di&s;tinct from mode&s;ty, that the mo&s;t ba&s;hful la&s;s, or raw country lout, often becomes the mo&s;t impudent; for their ba&s;hfulne&s;s being merely the in&s;tinctive timidity of ignorance, cu&s;tom &s;oon changes it into a&s;&s;urance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><L>'Such is the country-maiden's &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</L>

They trample on virgin ba&s;hfulne&s;s with a &s;ort of bravado, and glorying in their &s;hame, become more audaciou&s;ly lewd than men, however depraved, to whom this &s;exu|al quality has not been gratuitou&s;ly granted, ever appear to be. But the&s;e poor ignorant wretches never had any mode&s;ty to lo&s;e, when they con|&s;igned them&s;elves to infamy; for mode&s;ty is a virtue not a quality. No, they were only ba&s;h|ful, &s;hame-faced innocents; and lo&s;ing their in|nocence, their &s;hame-facedne&s;s was rudely bru&s;h|ed off; a virtue would have left &s;ome ve&s;tiges in the mind, had it been &s;acrificed to pa&s;&s;ion, to make us re&s;pect the grand ruin.</P>
<P>Purity of mind, or that genuine delicacy, which is the only virtuous &s;upport of cha&s;tity, is near akin to that refinement of humanity, which never re&s;ides in any but cultivated minds.

<P>The re&s;erve of rea&s;on, which, like habitual cleanline&s;s, is &s;eldom &s;een in any great degree, unle&s;s the &s;oul is active, may ea&s;ily be di&s;tingui&s;h|ed from ru&s;tic &s;hyne&s;s or wanton &s;kitti&s;hne&s;s; and, &s;o far from being incompatible with know|ledge, it is its faire&s;t fruit. What a gro&s;s idea of mode&s;ty had the writer of the following remark!

On reading &s;imilar pa&s;|&s;ages I have reverentially lifted up my eyes and heart to Him who liveth for ever and ever, and &s;aid, O my Father, ha&s;t Thou by the very con|&s;titution of her nature forbid Thy child to &s;eek Thee in the fair forms of truth? And, can her &s;oul be fullied by the knowledge that awfully calls her to Thee?</P>
<P>I have then philo&s;ophically pur&s;ued the&s;e re|flections till I inferred that tho&s;e women who have mo&s;t improved their rea&s;on mu&s;t have the mo&s;t mode&s;ty&mdash;though a dignified &s;edatene&s;s of deportment may have &s;ucceeded the playful, be|witching ba&s;hfulne&s;s of youth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mode&s;ty, is the graceful calm virtue of maturity; ba&s;hfulne&s;s, the charm of vivacious youth.</NOTE>.</P>

What can be more di&s;gu&s;t|ing than that impudent dro&s;s of gallantry, thought &s;o manly, which makes many men &s;tare in&s;ult|ingly at every female they meet? Is this re&s;pect for the &s;ex? This loo&s;e behaviour &s;hews &s;uch ha|bitual depravity, &s;uch weakne&s;s of mind, that it is vain to expect much public or private virtue, till both men and women grow more mode&s;t&mdash; till men, curbing a &s;en&s;ual fondne&s;s for the &s;ex, or an affectation of manly a&s;&s;urance, more prop|erly &s;peaking, impudence, treat each other with re&s;pect&mdash;unle&s;s appetite or pa&s;&s;ion gives the tone, peculiar to it, to their behaviour. I mean even per&s;onal re&s;pect&mdash;the mode&s;t re&s;pect of humani|ty, and fellow-feeling&mdash;not the the libidinous mockery of gallantry, nor the in&s;olent conde|&s;cen&s;ion of protector&s;hip.</P>
<P>To carry the ob&s;ervation &s;till further, mode&s;ty mu&s;t heartily di&s;claim, and refu&s;e to dwell with that debauchery of mind, which leads a man coolly to bring forward, without a blu&s;h, inde|cent allu&s;ions, or ob&s;cene wittici&s;ms, in the pre|&s;ence of a fellow creature; women are now out

of the que&s;tion, for then it is brutality. Re&s;pect for man, as man, is the foundation of every noble &s;entiment. How much more mode&s;t is the lib|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rtine who obeys the call of appetite or fancy, than the lewd joker who &s;ets the table in a roar!</P>
<P>This is one of the many in&s;tances in which the &s;exual di&s;tinction re&s;pecting mode&s;ty has pro|ved fatal to virtue and happine&s;s.

'Can any thing,' &s;ays Knox,
<Q>be more ab&s;urd than keeping women in a &s;tate of ignorance, and yet &s;o vehemently to in&s;i&s;t on their re&s;i&s;ting temptation?</Q>
&mdash;Thus when virtue or honour make it proper to check a pa&s;&s;ion, the burden is thrown on the weaker &s;houlders, contrary to rea&s;on and true mode&s;ty, which, at lea&s;t, &s;hould render the &s;elf-denial mu|tual, to &s;ay nothing of the genero&s;ity of bravery, &s;uppo&s;ed to be a manly virtue.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame &s;train runs Rou&s;&s;eau's and Dr. Gregory's advice re&s;pecting mode&s;ty, &s;trangely mi&s;called! for they both de&s;ire a wife to leave it in doubt whether &s;en&s;ibility or weakne&s;s led her to her hu&s;band's arms.&mdash;The woman is immode&s;t who can let the &s;hadow of &s;uch a doubt remain on her hu&s;band's mind a moment</P>
<P>But to &s;tate the &s;ubject in a different light.&mdash; The want of mode&s;ty, which I principally de|plore as &s;ubver&s;ive of morality, ari&s;es from the &s;tate of warfare &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly &s;upported by vo|luptuous men as the very e&s;&s;ence of mode&s;ty, though, in fact, its bane; becau&s;e it is a refine|ment

<P>Again; men boa&s;t of their triumphs over wo|men, what do they boa&s;t of?

<P>Men will probably &s;till in&s;i&s;t that woman ought to have more mode&s;ty than man; but it is not di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate rea&s;oners who will mo&s;t earn|e&s;tly oppo&s;e my opinion.

<P>Be&s;ides, women from nece&s;&s;ity, becau&s;e their minds are not cultivated, have recour&s;e very oft|en to what I familiarly term bodily wit; and their intimacies are of the &s;ame kind.

<P>On this account al&s;o, I object to many females being &s;hut up together in nur&s;eries, &s;chools, or convents. I cannot recollect without indigna|tion, the jokes and hoiden tricks, which knots of young women indulge them&s;elves in, when in my youth accident threw me, an awkward ru&s;tic, in their way.

<P>It may be thought that I lay too great a &s;tre&s;s on per&s;onal re&s;erve; but it is ever the handmaid of mode&s;ty. So that were I to name the graces that ought to adorn beauty, I &s;hould in&s;tantly

<P>When dome&s;tic friends meet in a morning, there will naturally prevail an affectionate &s;eriou&s;|ne&s;s, e&s;pecially, if each look forward to the di&s;|charge of daily duties; and, it may be reckoned fanciful, but this &s;entiment has frequently ri&s;en &s;pontaneou&s;ly in my mind, I have been plea&s;ed after breathing the &s;weet bracing morning air, to &s;ee the &s;ame kind of fre&s;hne&s;s in the countenances I particularly loved; I was glad to &s;ee them braced, as it were, for the day, and ready to run their cour&s;e with the &s;un.

<P>IT has long &s;ince occurred to me that advice re&s;pecting behaviour, and all the various modes of pre&s;erving a good reputation, which have been &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly inculcated on the female world, were &s;pecious poi&s;ons, that incru&s;ting morality eat away the &s;ub&s;tance.

The married woman, on the contrary, breaks a mo&s;t &s;acred engagement, and becomes a cruel mother when &s;he is a fal&s;e and faithle&s;s wife. If her hu&s;band has &s;till an affection for her, the arts which &s;he mu&s;t practi&s;e to deceive him, will ren|der her the mo&s;t contemptible of human beings; and, at any rate, the contrivances nece&s;&s;ary to pre|&s;erve
<PB N="232" REF="025054_0229_0FCDB72D30F07910">
appearances, will keep her mind in that childi&s;h, or vicious, tumult, which de&s;troys all its energy. Be&s;ides, in time, like tho&s;e people who habitually take cordials to rai&s;e their &s;pirits, &s;he will want an intrigue to give life to her thoughts, having lo&s;t all reli&s;h for plea&s;ures that are not highly &s;ea&s;oned by hope or fear.</P>
<P>Sometimes married women act &s;till more au|daciou&s;ly; I will mention an in&s;tance.</P>
<P>A woman of quality, notorious for her gal|lantries, though as &s;he &s;till lived with her hu&s;|band, nobody cho&s;e to place her in the cla&s;s where &s;he ought to have been placed, made a point of treating with the mo&s;t in&s;ulting con|tempt a poor timid creature, aba&s;hed by a &s;en&s;e of her former weakne&s;s, whom a neighbouring gentleman had &s;educed and afterwards married. This woman had actually confounded virtue with reputation; and, I do believe, valued her&s;elf on the propriety of her behaviour before marriage, though when once &s;ettled, to the &s;atisfaction of her family, &s;he and her lord were equally faith|le&s;s, &mdash;&s;o that the half alive heir to an immen&s;e e&s;tate, came from heaven knows where!</P>
<P>To view this &s;ubject in another light.</P>
<P>I have known a number of women who, if they did not love their hu&s;bands, loved nobody el&s;e, give them&s;elves entirely up to vanity and di&s;&s;ipation, neglecting every dome&s;tic duty; nay, even &s;quandering away all the money which &s;hould have been &s;aved for their helple&s;s younger children, yet have plumed them&s;elves on their un|&s;ullied reputation, as if the whole compa&s;s of their duty as wives and mothers was only to pre|&s;erve
<PB N="233" REF="025054_0230_0FCDB72E78B05C10">
it. Whil&s;t other indolent women neglect|ing every per&s;onal duty, have thought that they de&s;erved their hu&s;band's affection, becau&s;e they a&s;ked in this re&s;pect with propriety.</P>
<P>Weak minds are always fond of re&s;ting in the ceremonials of duty, but morality offers much &s;impler motives; and it were to be wi&s;hed that &s;uperficial morali&s;ts had &s;aid le&s;s re&s;pecting be|haviour, and outward ob&s;ervances, for unle&s;s vir|tue, of any kind, is built on knowledge, it will only produce a kind of in&s;ipid decency. Re&s;pect for the opinion of the world, has, however, been termed the principal duty of woman in the mo&s;t expre&s;s words, for Rou&s;&s;eau declares,
<Q>that repu|tation is no le&s;s indi&s;pen&s;able than cha&s;tity.</Q>
<Q>A man,</Q>
adds he,
<Q>&s;ecure in his own good con|duct, depends only on him&s;elf, and may brave the public opinion; but a woman, in behaving well, performs but half her duty; as what is thought of her, is as important to her as what &s;he really is. It follows hence, that the &s;y&s;tem of a woman's education &s;hould, in this re&s;pect, be directly contrary to that of ours. Opinion is the grave of virtue among the men; but its throne among women.</Q>
It is &s;trictly logical to infer that the virtue that re&s;ts on opinion is mere|ly worldly, and that it is the virtue of a being to whom rea&s;on has been denied. But, even with re&s;pect to the opinion of the world, I am con|vinced that this cla&s;s of rea&s;oners are mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>This regard for reputation, independent of its being one of the natural rewards or virtue, how|ever, took its ri&s;e from a cau&s;e that I have already deplored as the grand &s;ource of female depravity,
<PB N="234" REF="025054_0231_0FCDB72FF7952BF8">
the impo&s;&s;ibility of regaining re&s;pectability by a return to virtue, though men pre&s;erve theirs dur|ing the indulgence of vice. It was natural for women then to endeavour to pre&s;erve what once lo&s;t&mdash;was lo&s;t for ever, till this care &s;wallowing up every other care, reputation for cha&s;tity, be|came the one thing needful to the &s;ex. But vain is the &s;crupulo&s;ity of ignorance, for neither reli|gion nor virtue, when they re&s;ide in the heart, require &s;uch a puerile attention to mere ceremo|nies, becau&s;e the behaviour mu&s;t, upon the whole, be proper, when the motive is pure.</P>
<P>To &s;upport my opinion I can produce very re|&s;pectable authority; and the authority of a cool rea&s;oner ought to have weight to enforce con&s;i|deration, though not to e&s;tabli&s;h a &s;entiment. Speaking of the general laws of morality, Dr. Smith ob&s;erves,&mdash;
<Q>That by &s;ome very extraordi|nary and unlucky circum&s;tance, a good man may come to be &s;u&s;pected of a crime of which he was altogether incapable, and upon that ac|count be mo&s;t unju&s;tly expo&s;ed for the remain|ing part of his life to the horror and aver&s;ion of mankind. By an accident of this kind he may be &s;aid to lo&s;e his all, notwith&s;tanding his in|tegrity and ju&s;tice, in the &s;ame manner as a cautious man, notwith&s;tanding his utmo&s;t cir|cum&s;pection, may be ruined by an earthquake or an inundation. Accidents of the fir&s;t kind, however, are perhaps &s;till more rare, and &s;till more contrary to the common cour&s;e of things than tho&s;e of the &s;econd; and it &s;till remains true, that the practice of truth, ju&s;tice, and hu|manity, is a certain and almo&s;t infallible method
<PB N="235" REF="025054_0232_0FCDB732E6556A60">
of acquiring what tho&s;e virtues chiefly aim at, the confidence and love of tho&s;e we live with. A per&s;on may be ea&s;ily mi&s;repre&s;ented with re|gard to a particular action; but it is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould be &s;o with regard to the general tenor of his conduct. An innocent man may be believed to have done wrong: this, however, will rarely happen. On the contra|ry, the e&s;tabli&s;hed opinion of the innocence of his manners will often lead us to ab&s;olve him where he has really been in the fault, notwith|&s;tanding very &s;trong pre&s;umptions.</Q></P>
<P>I perfectly coincide in opinion with this wri|ter, for I verily believe that few of either &s;ex were ever de&s;pi&s;ed for certain vices without de|&s;erving to be de&s;pi&s;ed. I &s;peak not of the ca|lumny of the moment, which hangs over a cha|racter, like one of the den&s;e fogs of November, over this metropolis, till it gradually &s;ub&s;ides before the common light of day, I only con|tend that the daily conduct of the majority pre|vails to &s;tamp their character with the impre&s;&s;ion of truth. Quietly does the clear light, &s;hining day after day, refute the ignorant &s;urmi&s;e, or ma|licious tale, which has thrown dirt on a pure character. A fal&s;e light di&s;torted, for a &s;hort time, its &s;hadow&mdash;reputation; but it &s;eldom fails to become ju&s;t when the cloud is di&s;per&s;ed that produced the mi&s;take in vi&s;ion.</P>
<P>Many people, undoubtedly, in &s;everal re&s;pects obtain a better reputation than, &s;trictly &s;peaking, they de&s;erve; for unremitting indu&s;try will mo&s;t|ly reach its goal in all races. They who only &s;trive for this paltry prize, like the Phari&s;ees,
<PB N="236" REF="025054_0233_0FCDB734D4379920">
who prayed at the corners of &s;treets, to be &s;een of men, verily obtain the reward they &s;eek; for the heart of man cannot be read by man! Still the fair fame that is naturally reflected by good ac|tions, when the man is only employed to direct his &s;teps aright, regardle&s;s of the lookers-on, is, in general, not only more true, but more &s;ure.</P>
<P>There are, it is true, trials when the good man mu&s;t appeal to God from the inju&s;tice of man; and amid&s;t the whining candour or hi&s;&s;ings of envy, erect a pavilion in his own mind to retire to till the rumour be overpa&s;t; nay, the darts of unde&s;erved cen&s;ure may pierce an innocent ten|der bo&s;om through with many &s;orrows; but the&s;e are all exceptions to general rules. And it is according to the&s;e common laws that human behaviour ought to be regulated. The eccentric orbit of the comet never influences a&s;tronomical calculations re&s;pecting the invariable order e&s;tab|li&s;hed in the motion of the principal bodies of the &s;olar &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>I will then venture to affirm, that after a man is arrived at maturity, the general outline of his character in the world is ju&s;t, allowing for the before-mentioned exceptions to the rule. I do not &s;ay that a prudent, worldly-wi&s;e man, with only negative virtues and qualities, may not &s;ometimes obtain a more &s;mooth reputation than a wi&s;er or a better man. So far from it, that I am apt to conclude from experience, that where the virtue of two people is nearly equal, the mo&s;t negative character will be liked be&s;t by the world at large, whil&s;t the other may have more friends in pri|vate life. But the hills and dales, clouds and

&s;un&s;hine, con&s;picuous in the virtues of great men, &s;et off each other; and though they afford envi|ous weakne&s;s a fairer mark to &s;hoot at, the real character will &s;till work its way to light, though be|&s;pattered by weak affection, or ingenious malice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I allude to various biographical writings, but particularly to Bo&s;well's Life of John&s;on.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to that anxiety to pre&s;erve a re|putation hardly earned, which leads &s;agacious peo|ple to analyze it, I &s;hall not make the obvious comment; but I am afraid that morality is very in&s;idiou&s;ly undermined, in the female world, by the attention being turned to the &s;hew in&s;tead of the &s;ub&s;tance. A &s;imple thing is thus made &s;trangely complicated; nay, &s;ometimes virtue and its &s;hadow are &s;et at variance. We &s;hould never, perhaps, have heard of Lucretia, had &s;he died to pre&s;erve her cha&s;tity in&s;tead of her repu|tation. If we really de&s;erve our own good opin|ion we &s;hall commonly be re&s;pected in the world; but if we pant after higher improvement and higher attainments, it is not &s;ufficient to view our&s;elves as we &s;uppo&s;e that we are viewed by others, though this has been ingeniou&s;ly argued, as the foundation of our moral &s;entiments<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Smith.</NOTE>. Be|cau&s;e each by-&s;tander may have his own prejudices, be&s;ide the prejudices of his age or country. We &s;hould rather endeavour to view our&s;elves as we &s;uppo&s;e that Being views us who &s;eeth each thought ripen into action, and who&s;e judgment never &s;werves from the eternal rule of right.

<P>The leading principles which run through all my di&s;qui&s;itions, would render it unnece&s;&s;ary to enlarge on this &s;ubject, if a con&s;tant attention to keep the varni&s;h of the character fre&s;h, and in good condition, were not often inculcated as the &s;um total of female duty; if rules to regulate

the behaviour, and to pre&s;erve the reputation, did not too frequently &s;uper&s;ede moral obligations. But, with re&s;pect to reputation, the attention is confined to a &s;ingle virtue&mdash;cha&s;tity. If the honour of a woman, as it is ab&s;urdly called, is &s;afe, &s;he may neglect every &s;ocial duty; nay, ruin her family by gaming and extravagance; yet &s;till pre&s;ent a &s;hamele&s;s front&mdash;for truly &s;he is an hon|ourable woman!</P>
<P>Mrs. Macaulay has ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, that
<Q>there is but one fault which a woman of honour may not commit with impunity.</Q>
She then ju&s;tly, and humanely adds&mdash;
<Q>This has given ri&s;e to the trite and fooli&s;h ob&s;ervation, that the fir&s;t fault again&s;t cha&s;tity in woman has a radical power to deprave the character. But no &s;uch frail be|ings come out of the hands of nature. The human mind is built of nobler materials than to be &s;o ea&s;ily corrupted; and with all their di&s;advantages of &s;ituation and education, women &s;eldom become entirely abandoned till they are thrown into a &s;tate of de&s;peration, by the ven|omous rancour of their own &s;ex.</Q></P>
<P>But, in proportion as this regard for the repu|tation of cha&s;tity is prized by wom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, it is de|&s;pi&s;ed by men: and the two extremes are equally de&s;tructive to morality.</P>
<P>Men are certainly more under the influence of their appetites than women; and their appetites are more depraved by unbridled indulgence and the fa&s;tidious contrivances of &s;atiety. Luxury has introduced a refinement in eating, that de|&s;troys the con&s;titution; and a degree of gluttony which is &s;o bea&s;tly, that a perception of &s;eemli|ne&s;s
<PB N="241" REF="025054_0238_0FCDB741F2F954E8">
of behaviour mu&s;t be worn out before one being could eat immoderately in the pre&s;ence of another, and afterwards complain of the oppre&s;|&s;ion that his intemperance naturally produced. Some women, particularly French women, have al&s;o lo&s;t a &s;en&s;e of decency in this re&s;pect; for they will talk very calmly of an indige&s;tion. It were to be wi&s;hed that idlene&s;s was not allowed to generate, on the rank &s;oil of wealth, tho&s;e &s;warms of &s;ummer in&s;ects that feed on putrefac|tion, we &s;hould not then be di&s;gu&s;ted by the &s;ight of &s;uch brutal exce&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>There is one rule relative to behaviour that, I think, ought to regulate every other; and it is &s;imply to cheri&s;h &s;uch an habitual re&s;pect for mankind as may prevent us from di&s;gu&s;ting a fellow-creature for the &s;ake of a pre&s;ent indulg|ence. The &s;hameful indolence of many married women, and others a little advanced in life, fre|quently leads them to &s;in again&s;t delicacy. For, though convinced that the per&s;on is the band of union between the &s;exes, yet, how often do they from &s;heer indolence, or, to enjoy &s;ome trifling indulgence, di&s;gu&s;t?</P>
<P>The depravity of the appetite which brings the &s;exes together, has had a &s;till more fatal ef|fect. Nature mu&s;t ever be the &s;tandard of ta&s;te, the guage of appetite&mdash;yet how gro&s;sly is nature in&s;ulted by the voluptuary. Leaving the refine|ments of love out of the que&s;tion; nature, by making the gratification of an appetite, in this re&s;pect, as well as every other, a natural and imperious law to pre&s;erve the &s;pecies, exalts the appetite, and mixes a little mind and affection

with a &s;en&s;ual gu&s;t. The feelings of a parent mingling with an in&s;tinct merely animal, give it dignity; and the man and woman often meeting on account of the child, a mutual intere&s;t and af|fection is excited by the exerci&s;e of a common &s;ympathy. Women then having nece&s;&s;arily &s;ome duty to fulfil, more noble than to adorn their per|&s;ons, would not contentedly be the &s;laves of ca|&s;ual appetite; which is now the &s;ituation of a very con&s;iderable number who are, literally &s;peaking, &s;tanding di&s;hes to which every glutton may have acce&s;s.</P>
<P>I may be told that great as this enormity is, it only affects a devoted part of the &s;ex&mdash;devoted for the &s;alvation of the re&s;t.

For I will venture to a&s;&s;ert, that all the cau&s;es of fe|male weakne&s;s, as well as depravity, which I have already enlarged on, branch out of one grand cau&s;e&mdash;want of cha&s;tity in men.</P>
<P>This intemperance, &s;o prevalent, depraves the appetite to &s;uch a degree, that a wanton &s;timu|lus is nece&s;&s;ary to rou&s;e it; but the parental de|&s;ign of nature is forgotten, and the mere per&s;on,
<PB N="243" REF="025054_0240_0FCDB746448EC368">
and that for a moment, alone engro&s;&s;es the thoughts. So voluptuous, indeed, often grows the lu&s;tful prowler, that he refines on female &s;oftne&s;s. Something more &s;oft than woman is then &s;ought for; till, in Italy and Portugal, men attend the levees of equivocal beings, to &s;igh for more than female langour.</P>
<P>To &s;atisfy this genus of men, women are made &s;y&s;tematically voluptuous, and though they may not all carry their libertini&s;m to the &s;ame height, yet this heartle&s;s intercour&s;e with the &s;ex, which they allow them&s;elves, depraves both &s;exes, be|cau&s;e the ta&s;te of men is vitiated; and women, of all cla&s;&s;es, naturally &s;quare their behaviour to gratify the ta&s;te by which they obtain plea&s;ure and power. Women becoming, con&s;equently, weaker, in mind and body, than they ought to be, were one of the grand ends of their being taken into the account, that of bearing and nur&s;|ing children, have not &s;ufficient &s;trength to di&s;|charge the fir&s;t duty of a mother; and &s;acrificing to la&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s the parental affection, that enno|bles in&s;tinct, either de&s;troy the embryo in the womb, or ca&s;t it off when born. Nature in every thing demands re&s;pect, and tho&s;e who violate her laws &s;eldom violate them with impunity. The weak enervated women who particularly catch the attention of libertines, are unfit to be moth|ers, though they may conceive; &s;o that the rich &s;en&s;uali&s;t, who has rioted among women, &s;pread|ing depravity and mi&s;ery, when he wi&s;hes to per|petuate his name, receives from his wife only an half-formed being that inherits both its father's and mother's weakne&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. OF THE PERNICIOUS EFFECTS WHICH ARISE FROM THE UNNATURAL DISTINCTIONS ESTABLISHED IN SOCIETY.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the re&s;pect paid to property flow, as from a poi&s;oned fountain, mo&s;t of the evils and vices which render this world &s;uch a dreary &s;cene to the contemplative mind. For it is in the mo&s;t poli&s;hed &s;ociety that noi&s;ome reptiles and venom|ous &s;erpents lurk under the rank herbage; and there is voluptuou&s;ne&s;s pampered by the &s;till &s;ul|try air, which relaxes every good di&s;po&s;ition be|fore it ripens into virtue.</P>
<P>One cla&s;s pre&s;&s;es on another; for all are aiming to procure re&s;pect on account of their property: and property, once gained, will procure the re|&s;pect due only to talents and virtue. Men neg|lect the duties incumbent on man, yet are treat|ed like demi-gods; religion is al&s;o &s;eparated from morality by a ceremonial veil, yet men wonder that the world is almo&s;t, literally &s;peaking, a den of &s;harpers or oppre&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>There is a homely proverb, which &s;peaks a &s;hrewd truth, that whoever the devil finds idle he will employ. And what but habitual idlene&s;s can hereditary wealth and titles produce? For man is &s;o con&s;tituted that he can only attain a proper u&s;e of his faculties by exerci&s;ing them, and will not exerci&s;e them unle&s;s nece&s;&s;ity, of &s;ome kind, fir&s;t &s;et the wheels in motion. Vir|tue

likewi&s;e can only be acquired by the di&s;charge of relative duties; but the importance of the&s;e &s;a|cred duties will &s;carcely be felt by the being who is cajoled out of his humanity by the flattery of &s;ycophants. There mu&s;t be more equality e&s;tab|li&s;hed in &s;ociety, or morality will never gain ground, and this virtuous equality will not re&s;t firmly even when founded on a rock, if one half of mankind are chained to is bottom by fate, for they will be continually undermining it through ignorance or pride.</P>
<P>It is vain to expect virtue from women till they are, in &s;ome degree, independent of men; nay, it is vain to expect that &s;trength of natural affection, which would make them good wives and mothers. Whil&s;t they are ab&s;olutely de|pendent on their hu&s;bands they will be cunning, mean, and &s;elfi&s;h, and the men who can be grati|fied by the fawning fondne&s;s of &s;paniel-like af|fection, have not much delicacy, for love is not to be bought, in any &s;en&s;e of the words, its &s;ilken wings are in&s;tantly &s;hrivelled up when any thing be&s;ide a return in kind is &s;ought. Yet whil&s;t wealth enervates men; and women live, as it were, by their per&s;onal charms, how can we ex|pect them to di&s;charge tho&s;e ennobling duties which equally require exertion and &s;elf-denial. Hereditary property &s;ophi&s;ticates the mind, and the unfortunate victims to it, if I may &s;o ex|pre&s;s my&s;elf, &s;wathed from their birth, &s;eldom exert the locomotive faculty of body or mind; and, thus viewing every thing through one me|dium, and that a fal&s;e one, they are unable to di&s;cern in what true merit and happine&s;s con&s;i&s;t.
<PB N="248" REF="025054_0245_0FCDB74D3768C0E0">
Fal&s;e, indeed, mu&s;t be the light when the dra|pery of &s;ituation hides the man, and makes him &s;talk in ma&s;querade, dragging from one &s;cene of di&s;&s;ipation to another the nervele&s;s limbs that hang with &s;tupid li&s;tne&s;&s;ne&s;s, and rolling round the vacant eye which plainly tells us that there is no mind at home.</P>
<P>I mean, therefore, to infer that the &s;ociety is not properly organized which does not compel men and women to di&s;charge their re&s;pective du|ties, by making it the only way to acquire that countenance from their fellow-creatures, which every human being wi&s;hes &s;ome way to attain. The re&s;pect, con&s;equently, which is paid to wealth and mere per&s;onal charms, is a true north-ea&s;t bla&s;t, that blights the tender blo&s;&s;oms of af|fection and virtue. Nature has wi&s;ely attached affections to duties, to &s;weeten toil, and to give that vigour to the exertions of rea&s;on which only the heart can give. But, the affection which is put on merely becau&s;e it is the appropriated in&s;ig|nia of a certain character, when its duties are not fulfilled, is one of the empty compliments which vice and folly are obliged to pay to virtue and the real nature of things.</P>
<P>To illu&s;trate my opinion, I need only ob&s;erve, that when a woman is admired for her beauty, and &s;uffers her&s;elf to be &s;o far intoxicated by the admiration &s;he receives, as to neglect to di&s;charge the indi&s;pen&s;able duty of a mother, &s;he &s;ins again&s;t her&s;elf by neglecting to cultivate an affection that would equally tend to make her u&s;eful and hap|py. True happine&s;s, I mean all the contentment, and virtuous &s;atisfaction, that can be &s;natched in
<PB N="249" REF="025054_0246_0FCDB75425CC21D8">
this imperfect &s;tate, mu&s;t ari&s;e from well regu|lated affections; and an affection includes a duty. Men are not aware of the mi&s;ery they cau&s;e, and the vicious weakne&s;s they cheri&s;h, by only incit|ing women to render them&s;elves plea&s;ing; they do not con&s;ider that they thus make natural and artificial duties cla&s;h, by &s;acrificing the comfort and re&s;pectability of a woman's life to voluptuous notions of beauty, when in nature they all har|monize.</P>
<P>Cold would be the heart of a hu&s;band, were he not rendered unnatural by early debauchery, who did not feel more delight at &s;eeing his child &s;uck|led by its mother, than the mo&s;t artful wanton tricks could ever rai&s;e; yet this natural way of cementing the matrimonial tie, and twi&s;ting e&s;teem with fonder recollections, wealth leads women to &s;purn. To pre&s;erve their beauty, and wear the flowery crown of the day, that gives them a kind of right to reign for a &s;hort time over the &s;ex, they neglect to &s;tamp impre&s;&s;ions on their hu&s;bands' hearts, that would be remem|bered with more tenderne&s;s when the &s;now on the head began to chill the bo&s;om, than even their virgin charms. The maternal &s;olicitude of a rea&s;onable affectionate woman is very intere&s;ting, and the cha&s;tened dignity with which a mother returns the care&s;&s;es that &s;he and her child receive from a father who has been fulfilling the &s;erious duties of his &s;tation, is not only a re&s;pectable, but a beautiful &s;ight. So &s;ingular, indeed, are my feelings, and I have endeavoured not to catch factitious ones, that after having been fatigued with the &s;ight of in&s;ipid grandeur and the &s;lavi&s;h

I have then vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d with plea&s;ure a wo|man nur&s;ing her children, and di&s;charging the duties of her &s;tation with, perhaps, merely a &s;er|vant maid to take off her hands the &s;ervile part of the hou&s;ehold bu&s;ine&s;s. I have &s;een her prepare her&s;elf and children, with only the luxury of cleanline&s;s, to receive her hu&s;band, who return|ing weary home in the evening found &s;miling babes and a clean hearth. My heart has loitered in the mid&s;t of the group, and has even throbbed with &s;ympathetic emotion, when the &s;craping of the well known foot has rai&s;ed a plea&s;ing tu|mult.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t my benevolence has been gratified by contemplating this artle&s;s picture, I have thought that a couple of this de&s;cription, equally nece&s;|&s;ary and independent of each other, becau&s;e each fulfilled the re&s;pective duties of their &s;tation, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed all that life could give.&mdash;Rai&s;ed &s;ufficient|ly above abject poverty not to be obliged to weigh the con&s;equence of every farthing they &s;pend, and having &s;ufficient to prevent their attending to a frigid &s;y&s;tem of economy, which narrows both heart and mind. I declare, &s;o vulgar are my conceptions, that I know not what is wanted to render this the happie&s;t as well as the mo&s;t re|&s;pectable &s;ituation in the world, but a ta&s;te for literature, to throw a little variety and intere&s;t into &s;ocial conver&s;e, and &s;ome &s;uperfluous money to give to the needy and to buy books. For it is

not plea&s;ant when the heart is opened by com|pa&s;&s;ion and the head active in arranging plans of u&s;efulne&s;s, to have a prim urchin continually &s;witching back the elbow to prevent the hand from drawing out an almo&s;t empty pur&s;e, whi&s;|pering at the &s;ame time &s;ome prudential maxim about the priority of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>De&s;tructive, however, as riches and inherited honours are to the human character, women are more deba&s;ed and cramped, if po&s;&s;ible, by them, than men, becau&s;e men may &s;till, in &s;ome degree, unfold their faculties by becoming &s;oldiers and &s;tate&s;men.</P>
<P>As &s;oldiers, I grant, they can now only gather, for the mo&s;t part, vain glorious laurels, whil&s;t they adju&s;t to a hair the European balance, tak|ing e&s;pecial care that no bleak northern nook or &s;ound incline the beam. But the days of true heroi&s;m are over, when a citizen fought for his country like a Fabricius or a Wa&s;hington, and then returned to his farm to let his virtuous fer|vour run in a more placid, but not a le&s;s &s;alutary, &s;tream. No, our Briti&s;h heroes are oftener &s;ent from the gaming table than from the plow; and their pa&s;&s;ions have been rather inflamed by hang|ing with dumb &s;u&s;pen&s;e on the turn of a die, than &s;ublimated by panting after the adventurous march of virtue in the hi&s;toric page.</P>
<P>The &s;tate&s;man, it is true, might with more propriety quit the Faro Bank, or card-table, to guide the helm, for he has &s;till but to &s;huffle and trick. The whole &s;y&s;tem of Briti&s;h politics, if &s;y&s;tem it may courteou&s;ly be called, con&s;i&s;ting in multiplying dependents and contriving taxes

<P>But, to have done with the&s;e epi&s;odical ob&s;erv|ations, let me return to the more &s;pecious &s;lavery which chains the very &s;oul of woman, keeping her for ever under the bondage of ignorance.</P>
<P>The prepo&s;terous di&s;tinctions of rank, which render civilization a cur&s;e, by dividing the world between voluptuous tyrants, and cunning envi|ous dependents, corrupt, almo&s;t equally, every

cla&s;s of people, becau&s;e re&s;pectability is not at|tached to the di&s;charge of the relative duties of life, but to the &s;tation, and when the duties are not fulfilled the affections cannot gain &s;ufficient &s;trength to fortify the virtue of which they are the natural reward. Still there are &s;ome loop-holes out of which a man may creep, and dare to think and act for him&s;elf; but for a woman it is an herculean ta&s;k, becau&s;e &s;he has difficulties pe|culiar to her &s;ex to overcome, which require al|mo&s;t &s;uper-human powers.</P>
<P>A truly benevolent legi&s;lator always endeavours to make it the intere&s;t of each individual to be virtuous; and thus private virtue becoming the cement of public happine&s;s, an orderly whole is con&s;olidated by the tendency of all the parts to|wards a common centre. But, the private or public virtue of woman is very problematical; for Rou&s;&s;eau, and a numerous li&s;t of male writers, in&s;i&s;t that &s;he &s;hould all her life be &s;ubjected to a &s;evere re&s;traint, that of propriety. Why &s;ub|ject her to propriety&mdash;blind propriety, if &s;he be capable of acting from a nobler &s;pring, if &s;he be an heir of immortality? Is &s;ugar always to be produced by vital blood? Is one half of the hu|man &s;pecies, like the poor African &s;laves, to be &s;ubject to prejudices that brutalize them, when principles would be a &s;urer guard, only to &s;weet|en the cup of man? Is not this indirectly to de|ny woman rea&s;on? for a gift is a mockery, if it be unfit for u&s;e.</P>
<P>Women are, in common with men, rendered weak and luxurious by the relaxing plea&s;ures which wealth procures; but added to this they
<PB N="254" REF="025054_0251_0FCDB75E7B7D3F80">
are made &s;laves to their per&s;ons, and mu&s;t render them alluring that man may lend them his rea|&s;on to guide their tottering &s;teps aright. Or &s;hould they be ambitious, they mu&s;t govern their tyrants by &s;ini&s;ter tricks, for without rights there cannot be any incumbent duties. The laws re|&s;pecting woman, which I mean to di&s;cu&s;s in a future part, make an ab&s;urd unit of a man and his wife; and then, by the ea&s;y tran&s;ition of only con&s;idering him as re&s;pon&s;ible, &s;he is reduced to a mere cypher.</P>
<P>The being who di&s;charges the duties of its &s;ta|tion is independent; and, &s;peaking of women at large, their fir&s;t duty is to them&s;elves as rational creatures, and the next, in point of importance, as citizens, is that, which includes &s;o many, of a mother. The rank in life which di&s;pen&s;es with their fulfilling this duty, nece&s;&s;arily degrades them by making them mere dolls. Or, &s;hould they turn to &s;omething more important than merely fitting drapery upon a &s;mooth block, their minds are only occupied by &s;ome &s;oft pla|tonic attachment; or, the actual management of an intrigue may keep their thoughts in motion; for when they neglect dome&s;tic duties, they have it not in their power to take the field and march and counter-march like &s;oldiers, or wrangle in the &s;enate to keep their faculties from ru&s;ting.</P>
<P>I know that as a proof of the inferiority of the &s;ex, Rou&s;&s;eau has exultingly exclaimed, How can they leave the nur&s;ery for the camp!&mdash;And the camp has by &s;ome morali&s;ts been termed the &s;chool of the mo&s;t heroic virtues; though, I think, it would puzzle a keen ca&s;ui&s;t to prove
<PB N="255" REF="025054_0252_0FCDB75FF8209F30">
the rea&s;onablene&s;s of the greater number of wars that have dubbed heroes. I do not mean to con|&s;ider this que&s;tion critically; becau&s;e, having frequently viewed the&s;e freaks of ambition as the fir&s;t natural mode of civilization, when the ground mu&s;t be torn up, and the woods cleared by fire and &s;word, I do not choo&s;e to call them pe&s;ts; but &s;urely the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of war has little connection with virtue of any denomination, being rather the &s;chool of <HI>fine&s;&s;e</HI> and effeminacy, than of fortitude.</P>
<P>Yet, if defen&s;ive war, the only ju&s;tifiable war, in the pre&s;ent advanced &s;tate of &s;ociety, where virtue can &s;hew its face and ripen amid&s;t the ri|gours which purify the air on the mountain's top, were alone to be adopted as ju&s;t and glori|ous, the true heroi&s;m of antiquity might again animate female bo&s;oms.&mdash;But fair and &s;oftly, gentle reader, male or female, do not alarm thy|&s;elf, for though I have contra&s;ted the character of a modern &s;oldier with that of a civilized wo|man, I am not going to advi&s;e them to turn their di&s;taff into a mu&s;ket, though I &s;incerely wi&s;h to &s;ee the bayonet converted into a pruning-hook. I only recreated an imagination fatigued by con|templating the vices and follies which all pro|ceed from a feculent &s;tream of wealth that has muddied the pure rills of natural affection, by &s;uppo&s;ing that &s;ociety will &s;ome time or other be &s;o con&s;tituted, that man mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily fulfil the duties of a citizen, or be de&s;pi&s;ed, and that while he was employed in any of the departments of civil life, his wife, al&s;o an active citizen, &s;hould be equally intent to manage her family, educate her children, and a&s;&s;i&s;t her neighbours.</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="025054_0253_0FCDB76342F05990">But, to render her really virtuous and u&s;eful, &s;he mu&s;t not, if &s;he di&s;charge her civil duties, want, individually, the protection of civil laws; &s;he mu&s;t not be dependent on her hu&s;band's boun|ty for her &s;ub&s;i&s;tence during his life, or &s;upport after his death&mdash;for how can a being be generous who has nothing of its own? or, virtuous, who is not free?

<P>PARENTAL affection is, perhaps, the blind|e&s;t modification of perver&s;e &s;elf-love; for we have not, like the French<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">L'amour propre.

Power, in fact, is ever true to its vital principle, for in every &s;hape it would reign without controul or inquiry. Its throne is built acro&s;s a dark aby&s;s, which no eye mu&s;t dare to explore, le&s;t the ba&s;ele&s;s fabric &s;hould totter under inve&s;tigation.

one kind of de&s;poti&s;m &s;up|ports another. Tyrants would have cau&s;e to tremble if rea&s;on were to become the rule of duty in any of the relations of life, for the light might &s;pread till perfect day appeared. And when it did appear, how would r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n &s;mile at the &s;ight of the bugbears at which they &s;tarted during the night of ignorance, or the twilight of timid in|quiry.</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="025054_0261_0FCDB774F915D0B8">Parental affection, indeed, in many minds, is but a pretext to tyrannize where it can be done with impunity, for only good and wi&s;e men are content with the re&s;pect that will bear di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. Convinced that they have a right to what they in&s;i&s;t on, they do not fear rea&s;on, or dread the &s;ifting of &s;ubjects that recur to natural ju&s;tice: becau&s;e they firmly believe that the more en|lightened the human mind becomes the deeper root will ju&s;t and &s;imple principles take. They do not re&s;t in expedients, or grant that what is metaphy&s;ically true can be practically fal&s;e; but di&s;daining the &s;hifts of the moment they calmly wait till time, &s;anctioning innovation, &s;ilences the hi&s;s of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s or envy.</P>
<P>If the power of reflecting on the pa&s;t, and darting the keen eye of contemplation into futu|rity, be the grand privilege of man, it mu&s;t be granted that &s;ome people enjoy this prerogative in a very limited degree. Every thing now ap|pears to them wrong; and not able to di&s;tingui&s;h the po&s;&s;ible from the mon&s;trous, they fear where no fear &s;hould find a place, running from the light of rea&s;on, as if it were a firebrand; yet the limits of the po&s;&s;ible have never been defined to &s;top the &s;turdy innovator's hand.</P>
<P>Woman, however, a &s;lave in every &s;ituation to prejudice, &s;eldom exerts enlightened maternal af|fection; for &s;he either neglects her children, or &s;poils them by improper indulgence. Be&s;ides, the affection of &s;ome women for their children is, as I have before termed it, frequently very bruti&s;h: for it eradicates every &s;park of humani|ty.

the&s;e Rebekah's, and for the &s;ake of their <HI>own</HI> children they violate the mo&s;t &s;acred duties, for|getting the common relation&s;hip that binds the whole family on earth together. Yet, rea&s;on &s;eems to &s;ay, that they who &s;uffer one duty, or affection, to &s;wallow up the re&s;t, have not &s;uffi|cient heart or mind to fulfil that one con&s;cien|tiou&s;ly. It then lo&s;es the venerable a&s;pect of a duty, and a&s;&s;umes the fanta&s;tic form of a whim.</P>
<P>As the care of children in their infancy is one of the grand duties annexed to the female charac|ter by nature, this duty would afford many forci|ble arguments for &s;trengthening the female un|der&s;tanding, if it were properly con&s;idered.</P>
<P>The formation of the mind mu&s;t be begun very early, and the temper, in particular, requires the mo&s;t judicious attention&mdash;an attention which women cannot pay who only love their children becau&s;e they are their children, and &s;eek no fur|ther for the foundation of their duty, than in the feelings of the moment. It is this want of rea|&s;on in their affections which makes women &s;o oft|en run into extremes, and either be the mo&s;t fond or mo&s;t carele&s;s and unnatural mothers.</P>

Meek wives are, in general, fooli&s;h mothers; wanting their children to love them be&s;t, and take their part, in &s;ecret, again&s;t the father, who is held up as a &s;carecrow. If they are to be puni&s;hed, though they have offend|ed the mother, the father mu&s;t inflict the puni&s;h|ment; he mu&s;t be the judge in all di&s;putes: but

I &s;hall more fully di&s;cu&s;s this &s;ubject when I treat of private education, I now only mean to in|&s;i&s;t, that unle&s;s the under&s;tanding of woman be enlarged, and her character rendered more firm, by being allowed to govern her own conduct, &s;he will never have &s;ufficient &s;en&s;e or command of temper to manage her children properly. Her parental affection, indeed, &s;carcely de&s;erves the name, when it does not lead her to &s;uckle her children, becau&s;e the di&s;charge of this duty is equally calculated to in&s;pire maternal and filial affection: and it is the indi&s;pen&s;able duty of men and women to fulfil the duties which give birth to affections that are the &s;ure&s;t pre&s;ervatives again&s;t vice. Natural affection, as it is termed, I believe to be a very faint tie, affections mu&s;t grow out of the habitual exerci&s;e of a mutual &s;ympathy; and what &s;ympathy does a mother exerci&s;e who &s;ends her babe to a nur&s;e, and only takes it from a nur&s;e to &s;end it to a &s;chool?</P>
<P>In the exerci&s;e of their maternal feelings pro|vidence has furni&s;hed women with a natural &s;ub|&s;titute for love, when the lover becomes only a friend and mutual confidence takes place of over|&s;trained admiration&mdash;a child then gently twi&s;ts the relaxing cord, and a mutual care produces a new mutual &s;ympathy.&mdash;But a child, though a pledge of affection, will not enliven it, if both father and mother are content to transfer the charge to hire|lings; for they who do their duty by proxy &s;hould not murmur if they mi&s;s the reward of duty&mdash;parental affection produces filial duty.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. DUTY TO PARENTS.</HEAD>
<P>THERE &s;eems to be an indolent propen&s;i|ty in man to make pre&s;cription always take place of rea&s;on, and to place every duty on an arbitrary foundation. The rights of kings are deduced in a direct line from the King of kings; and that of parents from our fir&s;t parent.</P>
<P>Why do we thus go back for principles that &s;hould always re&s;t on the &s;ame ba&s;e, and have the &s;ame weight to-day that they had a thou&s;and years ago&mdash;and not a jot more? If parents di&s;|charge their duty they have a &s;trong hold and &s;acred claim on the gratitude of their children; but few parents are willing to receive the re|&s;pectful affection of their offspring on &s;uch terms. They demand blind obedience, becau&s;e they do not merit a rea&s;onable &s;ervice: and to render the&s;e demands of weakne&s;s and ignorance more binding, a my&s;terious &s;anctity is &s;pread round the mo&s;t arbitrary principle; for what other name can be given to the blind duty of obeying vicious or weak beings merely becau&s;e they obeyed a powerful in&s;tinct?</P>
<P>The &s;imple definition of the reciprocal duty, which naturally &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between parent and child, may be given in a few words: The parent who pays proper attention to helple&s;s infancy has a right to require the &s;ame attention when the fee|blene&s;s of age comes upon him. But to &s;ubju|gate
<PB N="268" REF="025054_0265_0FCDB782311A6F40">
a rational being to the mere will of another, after he is of age to an&s;wer to &s;ociety for his own conduct, is a mo&s;t cruel and undue &s;tretch of pow|er; and, perhaps, as injurious to morality as tho&s;e religious &s;y&s;tems which do not allow right and wrong to have any exi&s;tence, but in the Di|vine will.</P>
<P>I never knew a parent who had paid more than common attention to his children, di&s;regarded<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. John&s;on makes the &s;ame ob&s;ervation.</NOTE>; on the contrary, the early habit of relying almo&s;t implicitly on the opinion of a re&s;pected parent is not ea&s;ily &s;hook, even when matured rea&s;on convinces the child that his father is not the wi&s;e&s;t man in the world. This weakne&s;s, for a weakne&s;s it is, though the epithet amiable may be tacked to it, a rea&s;onable man mu&s;t &s;teel him&s;elf again&s;t; for the ab&s;urd duty, too often inculcated, of obeying a parent only on account of his being a parent, &s;hackles the mind, and prepares it for a &s;lavi&s;h &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to any power but rea&s;on.</P>
<P>I di&s;tingui&s;h between the natural and accident|al duty due to parents.</P>
<P>The parent who &s;eduou&s;ly endeavours to form the heart and enlarge the under&s;tanding of his child, has given that dignity to the di&s;charge of a duty, common to the whole animal world, that only rea&s;on can give. This is the parental af|fection of humanity, and leaves in&s;tinctive na|tural affection far behind. Such a parent acquires all the rights of the mo&s;t &s;acred friend&s;hip, and his advice, even when his child is advanced in life, demands &s;erious con&s;ideration.</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="025054_0266_0FCDB783372654F8">With re&s;pect to marriage, though after one and twenty a parent &s;eems to have no right to with|hold his con&s;ent on any account; yet twenty years of &s;olicitude call for a turn, and the &s;on ought, at lea&s;t, to promi&s;e not to marry for two or three years, &s;hould the object of his choice not entirely meet with the approbation of his fir&s;t friend.</P>
<P>But, re&s;pect for parents is, generally &s;peaking, a much more deba&s;ing principle; it is only a &s;elf|i&s;h re&s;pect for property. The father who is blindly obeyed, is obeyed from &s;heer weakne&s;s, or from motives that degrade the human character.</P>
<P>A great proportion of the mi&s;ery that wanders, in hideous forms around the world, is allowed to ri&s;e from the negligence of parents; and &s;till the&s;e are the people who are mo&s;t tenacious of what they term a natural right, though it be &s;ub|ver&s;ive of the birth-right of man, the right of acting according to the direction of his own rea|&s;on.</P>
<P>I have already very frequently had occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve, that vicious or indolent people are al|ways eager to profit by enforcing arbitrary privi|leges; and, generally, in the &s;ame proportion as they neglect the di&s;charge of the duties which alone render the privileges rea&s;onable. This is at the bottom a dictate of common &s;en&s;e, or the in|&s;tinct of &s;elf-defence, peculiar to ignorant weak|ne&s;s; re&s;embling that in&s;tinct, which makes a fi&s;h muddy the water it &s;wims in to allude its en|emy, in&s;tead of boldly facing it in the clear &s;tream.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="025054_0267_0FCDB7859CA63698">From the clear &s;tream of argument, indeed, the &s;upporters of pre&s;cription, of every denomi|nation, fly; and, taking refuge in the darkne&s;s, which, in the language of &s;ublime poetry, has been &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;urround the throne of Omnip|otence, they dare to demand that implicit re&s;pect which is only due to His un&s;earchable ways. But, let me not be thought pre&s;umptuous, the darkne&s;s which hides our God from us, only re|&s;pects &s;peculative truths&mdash;it never ob&s;cures moral ones, they &s;hine clearly, for God is light, and never, by the con&s;titution of our nature, requires the di&s;charge of a duty, the rea&s;onablene&s;s of which does not beam on us when we open our eyes.</P>
<P>The indolent parent of high rank may, it is true, extort a &s;hew of re&s;pect from his child, and females on the continent are particularly &s;ubject to the views of their families, who never think of con&s;ulting their inclination, or providing for the comfort of the poor victims of their pride. The con&s;equence is notorious; the&s;e dutiful daughters become adultere&s;&s;es, and neglect the education of their children, from whom they, in their turn, exact the &s;ame kind of obedience.</P>
<P>Females, it is true, in all countries, are too much under the dominion of their parents; and few parents think of addre&s;&s;ing their children in the following manner, though it is in this rea|&s;onable way that Heaven &s;eems to command the whole human race. It is your intere&s;t to obey me till you can judge for your&s;elf; and the Al|mighty Father of all has implanted an affection in me to &s;erve as a guard to you whil&s;t your rea|&s;on
<PB N="271" REF="025054_0268_0FCDB787191A4CD0">
is unfolding; but when your mind arrives at maturity, you mu&s;t only obey me, or rather re|&s;pect my opinions, &s;o far as they coincide with the light that is breaking in on your own mind.</P>
<P>A &s;lavi&s;h bondage to parents cramps every fac|ulty of the mind; and Mr. Locke very judiciou&s;|ly ob&s;erves, that
<Q>if the mind be curbed and humbled too much in children; if their &s;pirits be aba&s;ed and broken much by too &s;trict an hand over them; they lo&s;e all their vigour and in|du&s;try.</Q>
This &s;trict hand may in &s;ome degree account for the weakne&s;s of women; for girls, from various cau&s;es, are more kept down by their parents, in every &s;en&s;e of the word, than boys. The duty expected from them is, like all the du|ties arbitrarily impo&s;ed on women, more from a &s;en&s;e of propriety, more out of re&s;pect for deco|rum than rea&s;on; and thus taught &s;lavi&s;hly to &s;ubmit to their parents, they are prepared for the &s;lavery of marriage. I may be told that a num|ber of women are not &s;laves in the marriage &s;tate. True, but they then become tyrants; for it is not rational freedom, but a lawle&s;s kind of power re&s;embling the authority exerci&s;ed by the favourites of ab&s;olute monarchs, which they obtain by de|ba&s;ing means. I do not, likewi&s;e, dream of in|&s;inuating that either boys or girls are always &s;laves, I only in&s;i&s;t that when they are obliged to &s;ubmit to authority blindly, their faculties are weakened, and their tempers rendered imperious or abject. I al&s;o lament that parents, indolently availing them&s;elves of a &s;uppo&s;ed privilege, damp the fir&s;t faint glimmering of rea&s;on, rendering at the &s;ame time the duty, which they are &s;o anx|ious
<PB N="272" REF="025054_0269_0FCDB788F01F4E30">
to enforce, an empty name; becau&s;e they will not let it re&s;t on the only ba&s;is on which a duty can re&s;t &s;ecurely: for unle&s;s it be founded on knowledge, it cannot gain &s;ufficient &s;trength to re&s;i&s;t the &s;qualls of pa&s;&s;ion, or the &s;ilent &s;ap|ping of &s;elf-love. But it is not the parents who have given the &s;ure&s;t proof of their affection for their children, or, to &s;peak more properly, who by fulfilling their duty, have allowed a natural parental affection to take root in their hearts, the child of exci&s;ed &s;ympathy and rea&s;on, and not the over-weening offspring of &s;elfi&s;h pride, who mo&s;t vehemently in&s;i&s;t on their children &s;ubmitting to their will merely becau&s;e it is their will. On the contrary, the parent, who &s;ets a good example, patiently lets that example work; and it &s;eldom fails to produce its natural effect&mdash;filial re&s;pect.</P>
<P>Children cannot be taught too early to &s;ubmit to rea&s;on, the true definition of that nece&s;&s;ity, which Rou&s;&s;eau in&s;i&s;ted on, without defining it; for to &s;ubmit to rea&s;on is to &s;ubmit to the nature of things, and to that God, who formed them &s;o, to promote our real intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Why &s;hould the minds of children be warped as they ju&s;t begin to expand, only to favour the indolence of parents, who in&s;i&s;t on a privilege without being willing to pay the price fixed by nature? I have before had occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve, that a right always includes a duty, and I think it may, likewi&s;e, fairly be inferred, that they forfeit the right, who do not fulfil the duty.</P>
<P>It is ea&s;ier, I grant, to command than rea&s;on; but it does not follow from hence that children cannot comprehend the rea&s;on why they are made
<PB N="273" REF="025054_0270_0FCDB78B046A10E0">
to do certain things habitually; for, from a &s;teady adherence to a few &s;imple principles of conduct flows that &s;alutary power which a judicious par|ent gradually gains over a child's mind. And this power becomes &s;trong indeed, if tempered by an even di&s;play of affection brought home to the child's heart. For I believe, as a general rule, it mu&s;t be allowed that the affection which we in&s;pire always re&s;embles that we cultivate; &s;o that natural affections, which have been &s;up|po&s;ed almo&s;t di&s;tinct from rea&s;on, may be found more nearly connected with judgment than is commonly allowed. Nay, as another proof of the nece&s;&s;ity of cultivating the female under&s;tand|ing, it is but ju&s;t to ob&s;erve, that the affections &s;eem to have a kind of animal capriciou&s;ne&s;s when they merely re&s;ide in the heart.</P>
<P>It is the irregular exerci&s;e of parental authority that fir&s;t injures the mind, and to the&s;e irregu|larities girls are more &s;ubject than boys. The will of tho&s;e who never allow their will to be di&s;puted, unle&s;s they happen to be in a good hu|mour, when they relax proportionally, is almo&s;t always unrea&s;onable. To elude this arbitrary au|thority girls very early learn the le&s;&s;ons which they afterwards practi&s;e on their hu&s;bands; for I have frequently &s;een a little &s;harp-faced mi&s;s rule a whole family, excepting that now and then mamma's anger will bur&s;t out of &s;ome accidental cloud; either her hair was ill dre&s;&s;ed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I my&s;elf heard a little girl once &s;ay to a &s;ervant,
<Q>My mamma has been &s;colding me finely this morning, becau&s;e her hair was not dre&s;&s;ed to plea&s;e her.</Q>
Though this remark was pert, it was ju&s;t. And what re&s;pect could a girl acquire for &s;uch a parent without doing violence to rea&s;on?</NOTE>, or &s;he had lo&s;t more money at cards, the night before, than
<PB N="274" REF="025054_0271_0FCDB790C1C30CC0">
&s;he was willing to own to her hu&s;band; or &s;ome &s;uch moral cau&s;e of anger.</P>
<P>After ob&s;erving &s;allies of this kind, I have been led into a melancholy train of reflection re&s;pect|ing females, concluding that when their fir&s;t af|fection mu&s;t lead them a&s;tray, or make their du|ties cla&s;h till they re&s;t on mere whims and cu&s;|toms, little can be expected from them as they advance in life. How indeed can an in&s;tructor remedy this evil? for to teach them virtue on any &s;olid principle is to teach them to de&s;pi&s;e their parents. Children cannot, ought not, to be taught to make allowance for the faults of their parents, becau&s;e every &s;uch allowance weakens the force of rea&s;on in their minds, and makes them &s;till more indulgent to their own. It is one of the mo&s;t &s;ublime virtues of maturity that leads us to be &s;evere with re&s;pect to our&s;elves, and forbearing to others; but children &s;hould only be taught the &s;imple virtues, for if they begin too early to make allowance for human pa&s;&s;ions and manners, they wear off the fine edge of the criterion by which they &s;hould regulate their own, and become un|ju&s;t in the &s;ame proportion as they grow indulgent.</P>
<P>The affections of children, and weak people, are always &s;elfi&s;h; they love others, becau&s;e oth|ers love them, and not on account of their vir|tues. Yet, till e&s;teem and love are blended to|gether in the fir&s;t affection, and rea&s;on made the foundation of the fir&s;t duty, morality will &s;tum|ble at the thre&s;hold. But, till &s;ociety is very differently con&s;tituted, parents, I fear, will &s;till in|&s;i&s;t on being obeyed, becau&s;e they will be obeyed, and con&s;tantly endeavour to &s;ettle that power on a Divine right which will not bear the inve&s;tiga|tion of rea&s;on.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. ON NATIONAL EDUCATION.</HEAD>
<P>THE good effects re&s;ulting from attention to private education will ever be very confined, and the parent who really puts his own hand to the plow, will always, in &s;ome degree, be di&s;ap|pointed, till education become a grand national concern. A man cannot retire into a de&s;art with his child, and if he did he could not bring him|&s;elf back to childhood, and become the proper friend and play-fellow of an infant or youth. And when children are confined to the &s;ociety of men and women, they very &s;oon acquire that kind of premature manhood which &s;tops the growth of every vigorous power of mind or body. In or|der to open their faculties they &s;hould be excited to think for them&s;elves; and this can only be done by mixing a number of children together, and making them jointly pur&s;ue the &s;ame objects.</P>
<P>A child very &s;oon contracts a benumbing in|dolence of mind, which he has &s;eldom &s;ufficient vigour afterwards to &s;hake off, when he only a&s;ks a que&s;tion in&s;tead of &s;eeking for information, and then relies implicitly on the an&s;wer he receives. With his equals in age this could never be the ca&s;e, and the &s;ubjects of inquiry, though they might be influenced, would not be entirely under the direction of men, who frequently damp, if not de&s;troy, abilities, by bringing them forward too ha&s;tily: and too ha&s;tily they will infallibly
<PB N="276" REF="025054_0273_0FCDB79444EAD1D0">
be brought forward, if the child be confined to the &s;ociety of a man, however &s;agacious that man may be.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, in youth the &s;eeds of every affection &s;hould be &s;own, and the re&s;pectful regard, which is felt for a parent, is very different from the &s;o|cial affections that are to con&s;titute the happine&s;s of life as it advances. Of the&s;e equality is the ba&s;is, and an intercour&s;e of &s;entiments unclogged by that ob&s;ervant &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s which prevents di&s;|putation, though it may not enforce &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. Let a child have ever &s;uch an affection for his parent, he will always langui&s;h to play and chat with children; and the very re&s;pect which he entertains, for filial e&s;teem always has a da&s;h of fear mixed with it, will, if it do not teach him cunning, at lea&s;t prevent him from pouring out the little &s;ecrets which fir&s;t open the heart to friend&s;hip and confidence, gradually leading to more expan&s;ive benevolence. Added to this, he will never acquire that frank ingenuou&s;ne&s;s of behaviour, which young people can only attain by being frequently in &s;ociety where they dare to &s;peak what they think; neither afraid of being reproved for their pre&s;umption, nor laughed at for their folly.</P>
<P>Forcibly impre&s;&s;ed by the reflections which the &s;ight of &s;chools, as they are at pre&s;ent con|ducted, naturally &s;ugge&s;ted, I have formerly de|livered my opinion rather warmly in favour of a private education; but further experience has led me to view the &s;ubject in a different light. I &s;till, however, think &s;chools, as they are now regulated, the hotbeds of vice and folly, and the
<PB N="277" REF="025054_0274_0FCDB795373940B8">
knowledge of human nature, &s;uppo&s;ed to be at|tained there, merely cunning &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s.</P>
<P>At &s;chool boys become gluttons and &s;lovens, and, in&s;tead of cultivating dome&s;tic affections, ve|ry early ru&s;h into the libertini&s;m which de&s;troys the con&s;titution before it is formed; hardening the heart as it weakens the under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>I &s;hould, in fact, be aver&s;e to boarding-&s;chools, if it were for no other rea&s;on than the un&s;ettled &s;tate of mind which the expectation of the vaca|tions produce. On the&s;e the children's thoughts are fixed with eager anticipating hopes, for, at lea&s;t, to &s;peak with moderation, half of the time, and when they arrive they are &s;pent in total di&s;&s;i|pation and bea&s;tly indulgence.</P>
<P>But, on the contrary, when t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y are brought up at home, though they may pur&s;ue a plan of &s;tudy in a more orderly manner than can be adopted when near a fourth part of the year is actually &s;pent in idlene&s;s, and as much more in regret and anticipation; yet they there acquire too high an opinion of their own importance, from being allowed to tyrannize over &s;ervants, and from the anxiety expre&s;&s;ed by mo&s;t mothers, on the &s;core of manners, who, eager to teach the accompli&s;hments of a gentleman, &s;tifle, in their birth, the virtues of a man. Thus brought into company when they ought to be &s;eriou&s;ly em|ployed, and treated like men when they are &s;till boys, they become vain and effeminate.</P>
<P>The only way to avoid two extremes equally injurious to morality, would be to contrive &s;ome way of combining a public and private education. Thus to make men citizens two natural &s;teps
<PB N="278" REF="025054_0275_0FCDB79804BCD460">
might be taken, which &s;eem directly to lead to the de&s;ired point; for the dome&s;tic affections, that fir&s;t open the heart to the various modifica|tions of humanity, would be cultivated, whil&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> children were neverthele&s;s allowed to &s;pend great part of their time, on terms of equality, with other children.</P>
<P>I &s;till recollect, with plea&s;ure, the country day &s;chool; where a boy trudged in the morning, wet or dry, carrying his books, and his dinner, if it were at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance; a &s;ervant did n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t then lead ma&s;ter by the hand, for, when he had once put on coat and breeches, he was allowed to &s;hift for him&s;elf, and return alone in the evening to recount the feats of the day clo&s;e at the parental knee. His father's hou&s;e was his home, and was ever after fondly remembered; nay, I appeal to &s;ome &s;uperiour men, who were educated in this manner, whether the recollection of &s;ome &s;hady lane where they conned their le&s;&s;on; or, of &s;ome &s;tile, where they &s;at making a kite, or mending a bat, has not endeared their country to them?</P>
<P>But, what boy ever recollected with plea&s;ure the years he &s;pent in clo&s;e confinement, at an academy near London? unle&s;s, indeed, he &s;hould, by chance, remember the poor &s;carecrow of an u&s;her, whom he tormented; or, the tartman, from whom he caught a cake, to devour it with the catti&s;h appetite of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s. At boarding-&s;chools of every de&s;cription, the relaxation of the junior boys is mi&s;chief; and of the &s;enior, vice. Be&s;ides, in great &s;chools, what can be more pre|judicial to the moral character than the &s;y&s;tem of tyranny and abject &s;lavery which is e&s;tabli&s;hed
<PB N="279" REF="025054_0276_0FCDB79B606C04B0">
among&s;t the boys, to &s;ay nothing of the &s;lavery to forms, which makes religion wor&s;e than a farce? For what good can be expected from the youth who receives the &s;acrament of the Lord's &s;upper, to avoid forfeiting half a guinea, which he probably afterwards &s;pends in &s;ome &s;en&s;ual manner? Half the employment of the youths is to elude the nece&s;&s;ity of attending public wor|&s;hip; and well they may, for &s;uch a con&s;tant re|petition of the &s;ame thing mu&s;t be a very irk&s;ome re&s;traint on their natural vivacity. As the&s;e ce|remonies have the mo&s;t fatal effect on their mo|rals, and as a ritual performed by the lips, when the heart and mind are far away, is not now &s;tor|ed up by our church as a bank to draw on for the fees of the poor &s;ouls in purgatory, why &s;hould they not be aboli&s;hed?</P>
<P>But the fear of innovation, in this country, extends to every thing.&mdash;This is only a covert fear, the apprehen&s;ive timidity of indolent &s;lugs, who guard, by &s;liming it over, the &s;nug place, which they con&s;ider in the light of an hereditary e&s;tate; and eat, drink, and enjoy them&s;elves, in|&s;tead of fulfilling the duties, excepting a few emp|ty forms, for which it was endowed. The&s;e are the people who mo&s;t &s;trenuou&s;ly in&s;i&s;t on the will of the founder being ob&s;erved, crying out again&s;t all reformation, as if it were a violation of ju&s;tice. I am now alluding particularly to the relicks of popery retained in our colleges, when the prote&s;tant members &s;eem to be &s;uch &s;ticklers for the e&s;tabli&s;hed church; but their zeal never makes them lo&s;e &s;ight of the &s;poil of ignorance, which rapacious prie&s;ts of &s;uper&s;titious memory
<PB N="280" REF="025054_0277_0FCDB79D450F97E0">
have &s;craped together. No, wi&s;e in their gene|ration, they venerate the pre&s;criptive right of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, as a &s;trong hold, and &s;till let the &s;lug|gi&s;h bell tinkle to prayers, as during the days when the elevation of the ho&s;t was &s;uppo&s;ed to atone for the &s;ins of the people, le&s;t one reforma|tion &s;hould lead to another, and the &s;pirit kill the letter. The&s;e Romi&s;h cu&s;toms have the mo&s;t baneful effect on the morals of our clergy; for the idle vermin who two or three times a day perform in the mo&s;t &s;lovenly manner a &s;ervice which they think u&s;ele&s;s, but call their duty, &s;oon lo&s;e a &s;en&s;e of duty. At college, forced to attend or evade public wor&s;hip, they acquire an habitual contempt for the very &s;ervice, the per|formance of which is to enable them to live in idlene&s;s. It is mumbled over as an affair of bu|&s;ine&s;s, as a &s;tupid boy repeats his ta&s;k, and fre|quently the college cant e&s;capes from the preach|er the moment after he has left the pulpit, and even whil&s;t he is eating the dinner which he earned in &s;uch a di&s;hone&s;t manner.</P>
<P>Nothing, indeed, can be more irreverent than the cathedral &s;ervice as it is now performed in this country, nor does it contain a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">et of weaker men than tho&s;e who are the &s;laves of this childi&s;h routine. A di&s;gu&s;ting &s;keleton of the former &s;tate is &s;till exhibited; but all the &s;olemnity that intere&s;ted the imagination, if it did not purify the heart, is &s;tripped off. The performance of high ma&s;s on the continent mu&s;t impre&s;s every mind, where a &s;park of fancy glows, with that awful melancholy, that &s;ublime tenderne&s;s, &s;o near akin to devotion. I do not &s;ay that the&s;e devotional
<PB N="281" REF="025054_0278_0FCDB79E41FD2BA8">
feelings are of more u&s;e, in a moral &s;en&s;e, than any other emotion of ta&s;te; but I contend that the theatrical pomp which gratifies our &s;en&s;es, is to be preferred to the cold parade that in&s;ults the under&s;tanding without reaching the heart.</P>
<P>Among&s;t remarks on national education, &s;uch ob&s;ervations cannot be mi&s;placed, e&s;pecially as the &s;upporters of the&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hments, degenera|ted into puerilities, affect to be the champions of religion.&mdash;Religion, pure &s;ource of comfort in this vale of tears! how has thy clear &s;tream been muddied by the dabblers, who have pre&s;umptu|ou&s;ly endeavoured to confine in one narrow chan|nel, the living waters that ever flow towards God &mdash;the &s;ublime ocean of exi&s;tence! What would life be without that peace which the love of God, when built on humanity, alone can impart? Eve|ry earthly affection turns back, at intervals, to prey upon the heart that feeds it; and the pure&s;t ef|fu&s;ions of benevolence, often rudely damped by man, mu&s;t mount as a free-will offering to Him who gave them birth, who&s;e bright image they faintly reflect.</P>
<P>In public &s;chools, however, religion, confound|ed with irk&s;ome ceremonies and unrea&s;onable re|&s;traints, a&s;&s;umes the mo&s;t ungracious a&s;pect: not the &s;ober au&s;tere one that commands re&s;pect whil&s;t it in&s;pires fear; but a ludicrous ca&s;t, that &s;erves to point a pun. For, in fact, mo&s;t of the good &s;tories and &s;mart things which enliven the &s;pirits that have been concentrated at whi&s;t, are manufactured out of the incidents to which the very men labour to give a droll turn who coun|tenance the abu&s;e to live on the &s;poil.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="025054_0279_0FCDB79FC723C628">There is not, perhaps, in the kingdom, a more dogmatical, or luxurious &s;et of men, than the pe|dantic tyrants who re&s;ide in colleges and pre&s;ide at public &s;chools.

The boys, who live at a great ex|pen&s;e with the ma&s;ters and a&s;&s;i&s;tants, are never dome&s;ticated, though placed there for that pur|po&s;e; for, after a &s;ilent dinner, they &s;wallow a ha&s;ty gla&s;s of wine, and retire to plan &s;ome mi&s;|chievous trick, or to ridicule the per&s;on or man|ners of the very people they have ju&s;t been cring|ing to, and whom they ought to con&s;ider as the repre&s;entatives of their parents.</P>
<P>Can it then be a matter of &s;urpri&s;e that boys become &s;elfi&s;h and vicious who are thus &s;hut out from &s;ocial conver&s;e? or that a mitre often gra|ces the brow of one of the&s;e diligent pa&s;tors?</P>
<P>The de&s;ire of living in the &s;ame &s;tyle, as the rank ju&s;t above them, infects each individual and every cla&s;s of people, and meanne&s;s is the con|comitant of this ignoble ambition; but tho&s;e profe&s;&s;ions are mo&s;t deba&s;ing who&s;e ladder is pa|tronage: yet, out of one of the&s;e profe&s;&s;ions the tutors of youth are, in general, cho&s;en.

<P><PB N="283" REF="025054_0280_0FCDB7A140B83828">So far, however, from thinking of the morals of boys, I have heard &s;everal ma&s;ters of &s;chools argue, that they only undertook to teach Latin and Greek; and that they had fulfilled their du|ty, by &s;ending &s;ome good &s;cholars to college.</P>
<P>A few good &s;cholars, I grant, may have been formed by emulation and di&s;cipline; but to bring forward the&s;e clever boys, the health and morals of a number have been &s;acrificed.

<P>It is not for the benefit of &s;ociety that a few brilliant men &s;hould be brought forward at the expen&s;e of the multitude. It is true, that great men &s;eem to &s;tart up, as great revolutions occur, at proper intervals, to re&s;tore order, and to blow a&s;ide the clouds that thicken over the face of truth; but let more rea&s;on and virtue prevail in &s;ociety, and the&s;e &s;trong winds would not be ne|ce&s;&s;ary. Public education, of every denomina|tion, &s;hould be directed to form citizens; but if you wi&s;h to make good citizens, you mu&s;t fir&s;t exerci&s;e the affections of a &s;on and a brother. This is the only way to expand the heart; for public affections, as well as public virtues, mu&s;t ever grow out of the private character, or they are merely meteors that &s;hoot athwart a dark &s;ky and di&s;appear as they are gazed at and admired.</P>
<P>Few, I believe, have had much affection for mankind, who did not fir&s;t love their parents, their brothers, &s;i&s;ters, and even the dome&s;tic
<PB N="284" REF="025054_0281_0FCDB7A71A13CBE8">
brutes, whom they fir&s;t played with. The ex|erci&s;e of youthful &s;ympathies forms the moral temperature; and it is the recollection of the&s;e fir&s;t affections and pur&s;uits that gives life to tho&s;e that are afterwards more under the direction of rea&s;on. In youth, the fonde&s;t friend&s;hips are formed, the genial juices mounting at the &s;ame time, kindly mix; or, rather the heart, tempered for the reception of friend&s;hip, is accu&s;tomed to &s;eek for plea&s;ure in &s;omething more noble than the churli&s;h gratification of appetite.</P>
<P>In order then to in&s;pire a love of home and do|me&s;tic plea&s;ures, children ought to be educated at home, for riotous holidays only make them fond of home for their own &s;akes. Yet, the vaca|tions, which do not fo&s;ter dome&s;tic affections, continually di&s;turb the cour&s;e of &s;tudy, and ren|der any plan of improvement abortive which in|cludes temperance; &s;till, were they aboli&s;hed, children would be entirely &s;eparated from their parents, and I que&s;tion whether they would be|come better citizens by &s;acrificing the preparato|ry affections, by de&s;troying the force of relation|&s;hips that render the marriage &s;tate as nece&s;&s;ary as re&s;pectable.

people.

Not allowed, perhaps, to &s;tep out of one broad walk in a &s;uberb garden, and obliged to pace with &s;teady deportment &s;tu|pidly backwards and forwards, holding up their heads and turning out their toes, with &s;houlders braced back, in&s;tead of bounding, as nature di|rects to complete her own de&s;ign, in the various attitudes &s;o conducive to health<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I remember a circum&s;tance that once came under my own ob&s;ervation, and rai&s;ed my indignation.

The ma&s;ter took me into the &s;chool-room, &amp;c. but whil&s;t I walked down a broad gravel walk, I could not help ob&s;erving that the gra&s;s grew very luxuriantly on each &s;ide of me. I immediately a&s;ked the child &s;ome que&s;tions, and found that the poor boys were not allowed to &s;tir off the walk, and that the ma&s;ter &s;ome|times permitted &s;heep to be turned in to crop the untrodden gra&s;s. The ty|rant of this domain u&s;ed to &s;it by a window that overlooked the pri&s;on yard, and one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ook turning from it, where the unfortunate babes could &s;port freely, he enclo&s;ed, and planted it with potatoes. The wife likewi&s;e was equally anxious to keep the children in order, le&s;t they &s;hould dirty or tear their clothes.</NOTE>. The pure animal &s;pirits, which make both mind and body &s;hoot out, and unfold the tender blo&s;&s;oms of hope, are turned &s;our, and vented in vain wi&s;hes, or pert repinings, that contract the faculties and &s;poil the temper; el&s;e they mount to the brain, and &s;harpening the under&s;tanding before it gains proportionable &s;trength, produce that pitiful cun|ning which di&s;gracefully characterizes the female mind&mdash;and I fear will ever characterize it whil&s;t women remain the &s;laves of power!</P>

and, I think, that the ob&s;ervation may fairly be extended to the other &s;ex, till the natural inference is drawn which I have had in view throughout&mdash;that to improve both &s;exes they ought, not only in private families, but in public &s;chools, to be educated together. If marriage be the cement of &s;ociety, mankind &s;hould all be ed|ucated after the &s;ame model, or the intercour&s;e of the &s;exes will never de&s;erve the name of fellow|&s;hip, nor will women ever fulfil the peculiar du|ties of their &s;ex, till they become enlightened citizens, till they become free by being enabled to earn their own &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, independent of men; in the &s;ame manner, I mean, to prevent mi&s;con&s;truction, as one man is independent of another. Nay, marriage will never be held &s;a|cred till women, by being brought up with men, are prepared to be their companions rather than their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es; for the mean doublings of cun|ning will ever render them contemptible, whil&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion renders them timid. So convinced am I of this truth, that I will venture to predict that virtue will never prevail in &s;ociety till the virtues of both &s;exes are founded on rea&s;on; and, till the affections common to both are allowed to gain their due &s;trength by the di&s;charge of mutual du|ties.</P>

<P>This argument may be carried further than phi|lo&s;ophers are aware of, for if nature de&s;tined wo|man, in particular, for the di&s;charge of dome&s;tic duties, &s;he made her &s;u&s;ceptible of the attached affections in a great degree.

<P>With what a languid yawn have I &s;een an ad|mirable poem thrown down, that a man of true ta&s;te returns to, again and again with rapture; and, whil&s;t melody has almo&s;t &s;u&s;pended re&s;pira|tion, a lady has a&s;ked me where I bought my gown&punc; I have &s;een al&s;o an eye glanced coldly over a mo&s;t exqui&s;ite picture, re&s;t, &s;parkling with plea&s;ure, on a caricature rudely &s;ketched; and whil&s;t &s;ome terrific feature in nature has &s;pread a &s;ublime &s;till|ne&s;s through my &s;oul, I have been de&s;ired to ob|&s;erve the pretty tricks of a lap-dog, that my per|ver&s;e fate forced me to travel with. Is it &s;ur|pri&s;ing that &s;uch a ta&s;tele&s;s being &s;hould rather care&s;s this dog than her children? Or, that &s;he &s;hould prefer the rant of flattery to the &s;imple accents of &s;incerity?</P>
<P>To illu&s;trate this remark I mu&s;t be allowed to ob&s;erve, that men of the fir&s;t genius and mo&s;t cultivated minds, have appeared to have the high|e&s;t reli&s;h for the &s;imple beauties of nature&punc; and they mu&s;t have forcibly felt, what they have &s;o well de&s;cribed, the charm, which natural affec|tions, and un&s;ophi&s;ticated feelings &s;pread <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ound the human character. It is this power of look|ing into the heart, and re&s;pon&s;ively vibrating with each emotion, that enables the poet to per&s;onify each pa&s;&s;ion, and the painter to &s;ketch with a pencil of fire.</P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="025054_0289_0FCDB7B7B73AEE68">True ta&s;te is ever the work of the under&s;tand|ing employed in ob&s;erving natural effects; and till women have more under&s;tanding, it is vain to expect them to po&s;&s;e&s;s dome&s;tic ta&s;te.

<PB N="293" REF="025054_0290_0FCDB7BC257468D0">
duties which as women they are called upon by nature to fulfil. On the contrary, the &s;tate of warfare which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between the &s;exes, makes them employ tho&s;e wiles, that fru&s;trate the more open de&s;igns of force.</P>
<P>When, therefore, I call women &s;laves, I mean in a political and civil &s;en&s;e; for, indirectly they obtain too much power, and are deba&s;ed by their exertions to obtain illicit &s;way.</P>
<P>Let an enlightened nation <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">France.</NOTE> then try what ef|fect rea&s;on would have to bring them back to na|ture, and their duty; and allowing them to &s;hare the advantages of education and government with man, &s;ee whether they will become better, as they grow wi&s;er and become free. They cannot be injured by the experiment; for it is not in the power of man to render them more in&s;ignificant than they are at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>To render this practicable, day &s;chools, for particular ages, &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed by govern|ment, in which boys and girls might be educated together.

A &s;ufficient number of ma&s;ters &s;hould al&s;o be cho&s;en by a &s;elect committee, in each pari&s;h, to whom any com|plaint of negligence, &amp;c. might be made, if &s;ign|ed by &s;ix of the children's parents.</P>
<P>U&s;hers would then be unnece&s;&s;ary; for I be|lieve experience will ever prove that this kind of &s;ubordinate authority is particularly injurious to
<PB N="294" REF="025054_0291_0FCDB7BE2CA5A448">
the morals of youth. What, indeed, can tend to deprave the character more than outward &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion and inward contempt? Yet how can boys be expected to treat an u&s;her with re&s;pect, when the ma&s;ter &s;eems to con&s;ider him in the light of a &s;ervant, and almo&s;t to countenance the ridicule which becomes the chief amu&s;ement of the boys during the play hours.</P>
<P>But nothing of this kind could occur in an elementary day &s;chool, where boys and girls, the rich and poor, &s;hould meet together. And to prevent any of the di&s;tinctions of vanity, they &s;hould be dre&s;&s;ed alike, and all obliged to &s;ubmit to the &s;ame di&s;cipline, or leave the &s;chool. The &s;chool-room ought to be &s;urrounded by a large piece of ground, in which the children might be u&s;efully exerci&s;ed, for at this age they &s;hould not be confined to any &s;edentary employment for more than an hour at a time. But the&s;e relaxations might all be rendered a part of elementary educa|tion, for many things improve and amu&s;e the &s;en&s;es, when introduced as a kind of &s;how, to the principles of which, dryly laid down, children would turn a deaf ear. For in&s;tance, botany, mechanics, and a&s;tronomy. Reading, writing, arithmetic, natural hi&s;tory, and &s;ome &s;imple ex|periments in natural philo&s;ophy, might fill up the day; but the&s;e pur&s;uits &s;hould never en|croach on gymna&s;tic plays in the open air. The elements of religion, hi&s;tory, the hi&s;tory of man, and politics, might al&s;o be taught, by conver&s;a|tions, in the &s;ocratic form.</P>
<P>After the age of nine, girls and boys, intended for dome&s;tic employments, or mechanical trades,
<PB N="295" REF="025054_0292_0FCDB7BF486FCE28">
ought to be removed to other &s;chools, and re|ceive in&s;truction, in &s;ome mea&s;ure appropriated to the de&s;tination of each individual, the two &s;ex|es being &s;till together in the morning; but in the afternoon, the girls &s;hould attend a &s;chool, where plain-work, mantua-making, millinery, &amp;c. would be their employment.</P>
<P>The young people of &s;uperiour abilities, or for|tune, might now be taught in another &s;chool, the dead and living languages, the elements of &s;cience, and continue the &s;tudy of hi&s;tory and politics, on a more exten&s;ive &s;cale, which would not exclude polite literature.</P>
<P>Girls and boys &s;till together? I hear &s;ome read|ers a&s;k: yes. And I &s;hould not fear any other con&s;equence than that &s;ome early attachment might take place: which, whil&s;t it had the be&s;t effect on the moral character of the young people, might not perfectly agree with the views of the parents, for it will be a long time, I fear, before the world is &s;o enlightened that parents, only anxious to render their children virtuous, will let them choo&s;e companions for life them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, this would be a &s;ure way to promote early marriages, and from early marriages the mo&s;t &s;alutary phy&s;ical and moral effects naturally flow. What a different character does a married citizen a&s;&s;ume from the &s;elfi&s;h coxcomb, who lives but for him&s;elf, and who is often afraid to marry le&s;t he &s;hould not be able to live in a cer|tain &s;tyle. Great emergencies excepted, which would rarely occur in a &s;ociety of which equality was the ba&s;is, a man could only be prepared to di&s;charge the duties of public life, by the habitu|al
<PB N="296" REF="025054_0293_0FCDB7C0E06B6488">
practice of tho&s;e inferiour ones which form the man.</P>
<P>In this plan of education the con&s;titution of boys would not be ruined by the early debauche|ries, which now makes men &s;o &s;elfi&s;h, nor girls rendered weak and vain, by indolence, and frivo|lous pur&s;uits. But, I pre&s;uppo&s;e, that &s;uch a degree of equality &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed between the &s;exes as would &s;hut out gallantry and co|quetry, yet allow friend&s;hip and love to temper the heart for the di&s;charge of higher duties.</P>
<P>The&s;e would be &s;chools of morality&mdash;and the happine&s;s of man, allowed to flow from the pure &s;prings of duty and affection, what advances might not the human mind make? Society can only be happy and free in proportion as it is virtuous; but the pre&s;ent di&s;tinctions, e&s;tabli&s;hed in &s;ociety, corrode all private, and bla&s;t all public virtue.</P>
<P>I have already inveighed again&s;t the cu&s;tom of confining girls to their needle, and &s;hutting them out from all political and civil employments; for by thus narrowing their minds they are ren|dered unfit to fulfil the peculiar duties which nature has a&s;&s;igned them.</P>

<P>Humanity to animals &s;hould be particularly inculcated as a part of national education, for it is not at pre&s;ent one of our national virtues. Tenderne&s;s for their humble dumb dome&s;tics, among&s;t the lower cla&s;s, is oftener to be found in a &s;avage than a civilized &s;tate. For civilization prevents that intercour&s;e which creates affection in the rude hut, or mud cabin, and leads uncul|tivated minds who are only depraved by the re|finements which prevail in the &s;ociety, where they are trodden under foot by the rich, to domi|neer over them to revenge the in&s;ults that they are obliged to bear from their &s;uperiours.</P>
<P>This habitual cruelty is fir&s;t caught at &s;chool, where it is one of the rare &s;ports of the boys to torment the mi&s;erable brutes that fall in their way.

Ju&s;tice, or even benevolence, will not be a powerful &s;pring of ac|tion unle&s;s it be extended to the whole creation; nay, I believe that it may be delivered as an axi|om, that tho&s;e who can &s;ee pain, unmoved, will &s;oon learn to inflict it.</P>

to the &s;evere&s;t cen&s;ure?

<P>I am not conver&s;ant with the technical terms, nor initiated into the arcana, therefore, I may &s;peak improperly; but it is clear that men who will not conform to the law of rea&s;on, and earn a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence in an hone&s;t way, by degrees, are very fortunate in becoming acquainted with &s;uch obliging &s;pirits.

We &s;hould wi&s;h, though vainly, to fly from his pre&s;ence when fear ab&s;orbed love, and darkne&s;s involved all his coun&s;els!</P>
<P>I know that many devout people boa&s;t of &s;ub|mitting to the Will of God blindly, as to an ar|bitrary &s;ceptre or rod, on the &s;ame principle as the Indians wor&s;hip the devil. In other words, like people in the common concerns of life, they do homage to power, and cringe under the foot that can cru&s;h them. Rational religion, on the contrary, is a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the will of a being &s;o perfectly wi&s;e, that all he wills mu&s;t be directed by the proper motive&mdash;mu&s;t be rea&s;onable.</P>
<P>And, if thus we re&s;pect God, can we give cre|dit to the my&s;terious in&s;inuations, which in&s;ult his laws? can we believe, though it &s;hould &s;tare us in the face, that he would work a miracle to au|thori&s;e confu&s;ion by &s;anctioning an error?

<P>ANOTHER in&s;tance of that feminine weakne&s;s of character, often produced by a confined educa|tion, is a romantic twi&s;t of the mind, which has been very properly termed <HI>&s;entimental.</HI></P>
<P>Women &s;ubjected by ignorance to their &s;en|&s;ations, and only taught to look for happine&s;s in love, refine on &s;en&s;ual feelings, and adopt meta|phy&s;ical notions re&s;pecting that pa&s;&s;ion, which lead them &s;hamefully to neglect the duties of life, and frequently in the mid&s;t of the&s;e &s;ublime refinements they plump into actual vice.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the women who are amu&s;ed by the reveries of the &s;tupid noveli&s;ts, who, knowing little of human nature, work up &s;tale tales, and de&s;cribe meretricious &s;cenes, all retailed in a &s;entimental jargon, which equally tend to corrupt the ta&s;te, and draw the heart a&s;ide from its daily duties. I do not mention the under&s;tanding, becau&s;e never having been exerci&s;ed, its &s;lumbering energies re&s;t inactive, like the lurking particles of fire which are &s;uppo&s;ed univer&s;ally to pervade matter.</P>
<P>Females, in fact, denied all political privileges, and not allowed, as married women, excepting in criminal ca&s;es, a civil exi&s;tence, have their atten|tion naturally drawn from the intere&s;t of the whole community to that of the minute parts, though the private duty of any member of &s;ociety mu&s;t
<PB N="322" REF="025054_0319_0FCDB7F841BE6558">
be very imperfectly performed when not con|nected with the general good. The mighty bu&s;i|ne&s;s of female life is to plea&s;e, and re&s;trained from entering into more important concerns by po|litical and civil oppre&s;&s;ion, &s;entiments become events, and reflection deepens what it &s;hould, and would have effaced, if the under&s;tanding had been allowed to take a wider range.</P>
<P>But, confined to trifling employments, they naturally imbibe opinions which the only kind of reading calculated to intere&s;t an innocent fri|volous mind, in&s;pires. Unable to gra&s;p any thing great, is it &s;urpri&s;ing that they find the reading of hi&s;tory a very dry ta&s;k, and di&s;qui&s;itions ad|dre&s;&s;ed to the under&s;tanding intollerably tedious, and almo&s;t unintelligible? Thus are they nece&s;|&s;arily dependent on the noveli&s;t for amu&s;ement. Yet, when I exclaim again&s;t novels, I mean when contra&s;ted with tho&s;e works which exerci&s;e the under&s;tanding and regulate the imagination.&mdash; For any kind of reading I think better than leav|ing a blank &s;till a blank, becau&s;e the mind mu&s;t receive a degree of enlargement and obtain a lit|tle &s;trength by a &s;light exertion of its thinking powers; be&s;ides even the productions that are only addre&s;&s;ed to the imagination, rai&s;e the read|er a little above the gro&s;s gratification of appe|tites, to which the mind has not given a &s;hade of delicacy.</P>
<P>This ob&s;ervation is the re&s;ult of experience; for I have known &s;everal notable women, and one in particular, who was a very good woman&mdash;as good as &s;uch a narrow mind would allow her to be, who took care that her daughters (three in
<PB N="323" REF="025054_0320_0FCDB7FBF8A9FF28">
number) &s;hould never &s;ee a novel. As &s;he was a woman of fortune and fa&s;hion, they had various ma&s;ters to attend them, and a &s;ort of mental gov|erne&s;s to watch their foot&s;teps. From their ma&s;|ters they learned how tables, chairs, &amp;c. were called in French and Italian; but as the few books thrown in their way were far above their capacities, or devotional, they neither acquired ideas nor &s;entiments, and pa&s;&s;ed their time when not compelled to repeat <HI>words,</HI> in dre&s;&s;ing, quar|relling with each other, or conver&s;ing with their maids by &s;tealth, till they were brought into com|pany as marriageable.</P>
<P>Their mother, a widow, was bu&s;y in the mean time in keeping up her connections, as &s;he term|ed a numerous acquaintance, le&s;t her girls &s;hould want a proper introduction into the great world. And the&s;e young ladies, with minds vulgar in every &s;en&s;e of the word, and &s;poiled tempers, en|tered life puffed up with notions of their own con&s;equence, and looking down with contempt on tho&s;e who could not vie with them in dre&s;s and parade.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to love, nature, or their nur&s;es, had taken care to teach them the phy&s;ical mean|ing of the word; and, as they had few topics of conver&s;ation, and fewer refinements of &s;entiment, they expre&s;&s;ed their gro&s;s wi&s;hes not in very deli|cate phra&s;es, when they &s;poke freely, talking of matrimony.</P>
<P>Could the&s;e girls have been injured by the pe|ru&s;al of novels? I almo&s;t forgot a &s;hade in the character of one of them; &s;he affected a &s;implici|ty bordering on folly, and with a &s;imper would
<PB N="324" REF="025054_0321_0FCDB7FDB68AEBD0">
utter the mo&s;t immode&s;t remarks and que&s;tions, the full meaning of which &s;he had learned whil&s;t &s;ecluded from the world, and afraid to &s;peak in her mother's pre&s;ence, who governed with a high hand: they were all educated, as &s;he prided her|&s;elf, in a mo&s;t exemplary manner; and read their chapters and p&s;alms before breakfa&s;t, never touch|ing a &s;illy novel.</P>
<P>This is only one in&s;tance; but I recollect ma|ny other women who, not led by degrees to pro|per &s;tudies, and not permitted to choo&s;e for them|&s;elves, have indeed been overgrown children; or have obtained, by mixing in the world, a little of what is termed common &s;en&s;e; that is a di&s;tinct manner of &s;eeing common occurrences, as they &s;tand detached: but what de&s;erves the name of intellect, the power of gaining general or ab&s;tract ideas, or even intermediate ones, was out of the que&s;tion. Their minds were quie&s;cent, and when they were not rou&s;ed by &s;en&s;ible objects and em|ployments of that kind, they were low-&s;pirited, would cry, or go to &s;leep.</P>
<P>When, therefore, I advi&s;e my &s;ex not to read &s;uch flim&s;y works, it is to induce them to read &s;omething &s;uperiour; for I coincide in opinion with a &s;agacious man, who, having a daughter and niece under his care, pur&s;ued a very different plan with each.</P>
<P>The niece, who had con&s;iderable abilities, had, before &s;he was left to his guardian&s;hip, been in|dulged in de&s;ultory reading. Her he endeavour|ed to lead, and did lead to hi&s;tory and moral e&s;|&s;ays; but his daughter, whom a fond, weak mo|ther had indulged, and who con&s;equently was
<PB N="325" REF="025054_0322_0FCDB7FF279D8E48">
aver&s;e to every thing like application, he allowed to read novels: and u&s;ed to ju&s;tify his conduct by &s;aying, that if &s;he ever attained a reli&s;h for reading them, he &s;hould have &s;ome foundation to work upon; and that erroneous opinions were better than none at all.</P>
<P>In fact the female mind has been &s;o totally ne|glected, that knowledge was only to be acquired from this muddy &s;ource, till from reading novels &s;ome women of &s;uperior talents learned to de&s;pi&s;e them.</P>
<P>The be&s;t method, I believe, that can be adopted to correct a fondne&s;s for novels is to ridicule them: not indi&s;criminately, for then it would have little effect; but, if a judicious per&s;on, with &s;ome turn for humour, would read &s;everal to a young girl, and point but both by tones, and apt compari&s;ons with pathetic incidents and heroic characters in hi&s;tory, how fooli&s;hly and ridicu|lou&s;ly they caricatured human nature, ju&s;t opin|ions might be &s;ub&s;tituted in&s;tead of romantic &s;entiments.</P>
<P>In one re&s;pect, however, the majority of both &s;exes re&s;emble, and equally &s;hew a want of ta&s;te and mode&s;ty. Ignorant women, forced to be cha&s;te to pre&s;erve their reputation, allow their imagination to revel in the unnatural and mere|tricious &s;cenes &s;ketched by the novel writers of the day, &s;lighting as in&s;ipid the &s;ober dignity and matronly graces of hi&s;tory<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I am not now alluding to that &s;uperiority of mind which leads to the creation of ideal beauty, when life, &s;urveyed with a penetrating eye, ap|pears a trag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">-comedy, in which little can be &s;een to &s;ati&s;fy the heart with|out the help of fancy.</NOTE>, whil&s;t men carry

<P>I have &s;ometimes compared the &s;truggles of the&s;e poor children who ought never to have felt re&s;traint, nor would, had they been always held in with an even hand, to the de&s;pairing plunges of a &s;pirited filly, which I have &s;een breaking on a &s;trand: its feet &s;inking deeper and deeper in the &s;and every time it endeavoured to throw its rider, till at la&s;t it &s;ullenly &s;ubmitted.</P>
<P>I have always found hor&s;es, an animal I am at|tached to, very tractable when treated with hu|manity and &s;teadine&s;s, &s;o that I doubt whether the violent methods taken to break them; do not e&s;&s;entially injure them; I am, however, certain that a child &s;hould never be thus forcibly tamed after it has injudiciou&s;ly been allowed to run wild; for every violation of ju&s;tice and rea&s;on, in the treatment of children, weakens their rea&s;on. And, &s;o early do they catch a character, that the ba&s;e of the moral character, experience leads me to infer, is fixed before their &s;eventh year, the period during which women are allowed the &s;ole management of children. Afterwards it too often happens that half the bu&s;ine&s;s of education is to correct, and very imperfectly is it done, if done ha&s;tily, the faults, which they would never have acquired if their mothers had had more under|&s;tanding.</P>
<P><PB N="333" REF="025054_0330_0FCDB8146571EC18">One &s;triking in&s;tance of the folly of women mu&s;t not be omitted.&mdash;The manner in which they treat &s;ervants in the pre&s;ence of children, permitting them to &s;uppo&s;e that they ought to wait on them, and bear their humours. A child &s;hould always be made to receive a&s;&s;i&s;tance from a man or woman as a favour; and, as the fir&s;t le&s;&s;on of independence, they &s;hould practically be taught, by the example of their mother, not to require that per&s;onal attendance, which it is an in&s;ult to humanity to require, when in health; and in&s;tead of being led to a&s;&s;ume airs of con&s;e|quence, a &s;en&s;e of their own weakne&s;s &s;hould fir&s;t make them feel the natural equality of man. Yet, how frequently have I indignantly heard &s;ervants imperiou&s;ly called to put children to bed, and &s;ent away again and again, becau&s;e ma&s;ter or mi&s;s hung about mamma, to &s;tay a little longer. Thus made &s;lavi&s;hly to attend the little idol, all tho&s;e mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;ting humours were exhibited which characterize a &s;poiled child.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, &s;peaking of the majority of mothers, they leave their children entirely to the care of &s;ervants; or, becau&s;e they are their children treat them as if they were little demi-gods, though I have always ob&s;erved, that the women who thus idolize their children, &s;eldom &s;hew common hu|manity to &s;ervants, or feel the lea&s;t tenderne&s;s for any children but their own.</P>
<P>It is, however, the&s;e exclu&s;ive affections, and an individual manner of &s;eeing things produced by ignorance, which keep women for ever at a &s;tand, with re&s;pect to improvement, and make many of them dedicate their lives to their chil|dren

<P>But, vi&s;iting to di&s;play finery, card-playing, and balls, not to mention the idle bu&s;tle of morning trifling, draw women from their duty to render them in&s;ignificant, to render them plea&s;ing, ac|cording to the pre&s;ent acceptation of the word, to every man, but their hu&s;band.

<P><PB N="336" REF="025054_0333_0FCDB81B772E3880">To render women truly u&s;eful members of &s;o|ciety, I argue that they &s;hould be led, by having their under&s;tandings cultivated on a large &s;cale, to acquire a rational affection for their country, founded on knowledge, becau&s;e it is obvious that we are little intere&s;ted about what we do not un|der&s;tand. And to render this general knowledge of due importance, I have endeavoured to &s;hew that private duties are never properly fulfilled un|le&s;s the under&s;tanding enlarges the heart; and that public virtue is only an aggregate of pri|vate. But, the di&s;tinctions e&s;tabli&s;hed in &s;ociety undermine both, by beating out the &s;olid gold of virtue, till it becomes only the tin&s;el-covering of vice; for whil&s;t wealth renders a man more re|&s;pectable than virtue, wealth will be &s;ought be|fore virtue; and whil&s;t women's per&s;ons are ca|re&s;&s;ed, when a childi&s;h &s;imper &s;hews an ab&s;ence of mind&mdash;the mind will lie fallow.

<P>That women at pre&s;ent are by ignorance ren|dered fooli&s;h or vicious, is, I think, not to be di&s;puted; and, that the mo&s;t &s;alutary effects tend|ing to improve mankind might be expected from a REVOLUTION in female manners, ap|pears, at lea&s;t, with a face of probability, to ri&s;e out of the ob&s;ervation. For as marriage has been termed the parent of tho&s;e endearing chari|ties which draw man from the brutal herd, the cor|rupting intercour&s;e that wealth, idlene&s;s, and fol|ly, produce between the &s;exes, is more univer&s;ally injurious to morality than all the other vices of mankind collectively con&s;idered. To adulterous lu&s;t the mo&s;t &s;acred duties are &s;acrificed, be|cau&s;e before marriage, men, by a promi&s;cuous intimacy with women, learned to con&s;ider love as a &s;elfi&s;h gratification&mdash;learned to &s;eparate it not only from e&s;teem but from the affection merely built on habit, which mixes a little hu|manity with it. Ju&s;tice and friend&s;hip are al&s;o &s;et at defiance, and that purity of ta&s;te is vitiated which would naturally lead a man to reli&s;h an art|le&s;s di&s;play of affection rather than affected airs.

the matrimonial tie, &s;ecures to the pledges of a warmer pa&s;&s;ion the nece&s;&s;ary parental attention; for children will never be properly educated till friend&s;hip &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between parents. Virtue flies from a hou&s;e divided again&s;t it&s;elf&mdash;and a whole legion of devils take up their re&s;idence there.</P>
<P>The affection of hu&s;bands and wives cannot be pure when they have &s;o few &s;entiments in common, and when &s;o little confidence is e&s;tab|li&s;hed at home, as mu&s;t be the ca&s;e when their pur|&s;uits are &s;o different.

<P>Let woman &s;hare the rights and &s;he will em|ulate the virtues of man; for &s;he mu&s;t grow more perfect when emancipated, or ju&s;tify the authority that chains &s;uch a weak being to her duty.&mdash;If the latter, it will be expedient to open a fre&s;h trade with Ru&s;&s;ia for whips; a pre&s;ent which a father &s;hould always make to his &s;on-in-law on his wedding day, that a hu&s;band may keep his whole family in order by the &s;ame means; and without any violation of ju&s;tice reign, wield|ing this &s;ceptre, &s;ole ma&s;ter of his hou&s;e, becau&s;e he is the only being in it who has rea&s;on:&mdash;the divine, indefea&s;ible earthly &s;overeignty breathed into man by the Ma&s;ter of the univer&s;e. Allow|ing this po&s;ition, women have not any inherent rights to claim, and by the &s;ame rule, their duties Vani&s;h for rights and duties are in&s;eparable.</P>
<P>Be ju&s;t then, O ye men of under&s;tanding! and mark not more &s;everely what women do ami&s;s, than the vicious tricks of the hor&s;e or the a&s;s for whom ye provide provender&mdash;and allow her the privileges of ignorance, to whom ye deny the rights of rea&s;on, or ye will be wor&s;e than Egyp|tian ta&s;k-ma&s;ters, expecting virtue where nature has not given under&s;tanding!</P>
