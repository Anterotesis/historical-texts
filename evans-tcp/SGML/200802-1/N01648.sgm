<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_THAT the Office and Work of the Go&s;pel-Mi|ni&s;try is founded on Divine In&s;titution, may ea&s;ily appear to tho&s;e, who read the Scriptures with &s;erious unbyas'd thought and ob&s;ervation. Its a work, the right performance whereof is attended with many and great difficulties; partly from the various, frequent, furious A&s;&s;aults of Satan; partly from the Lu&s;ts of Men, variou&s;ly di&s;couraging or op|po&s;ing of it; and partly from the weakne&s;ses and re|maining corruptions, even of the be&s;t of tho&s;e, who engage in it. Yet 'tis a Work very honourable in it &s;elf, and of va&s;t Weight and Importance. It mu&s;t needs be thought &s;o, if we rightly con&s;ider, that 'tis the Infinitely Great, Glorious, Holy, Heart-&s;earching God, who (in His Providence) Calls and Commi&s;&s;ions Men to this Work; that the main Scope of the Work is, to batter down Satans Kingdom, to pull down the &s;trong holds of Lu&s;t in the Hearts of Men, to promote the Glory of Divine Grace thro' Chri&s;t, in &s;aving
<PB N="ii" REF="001956_0003_0FBA4007D8732F90">
Mens Precious Immortal Souls, one of which is more worth than a World; and that tho&s;e who engage in this Work, mu&s;t give up a &s;trict account of their Management, to that God who employs them, who can't be deceived and won't be mocked, and who will require at their hands the Blood of tho&s;e Souls that pe|ri&s;h thro' their neglect, as well as graciou&s;ly and abun|dantly reward them if they are Faithful. The&s;e brief hints &s;how, that the Work of the Go&s;pel-Mini&s;try is exceeding great, weighty and important. If the &s;en&s;e hereof made <HI>Paul</HI> (who came not behind the chiefe&s;t Apo&s;tles) to cry out, <HI>Who is &s;ufficient for the&s;e things;</HI> how much more might it make the able&s;t of Ordinary Mini&s;ters to do &s;o? A great variety of Gifts and endowments (not to be obtain'd without a cour&s;e of inten&s;e laborious Study and Prayer) deep Hu|mility of mind, unfainting application and un&s;haken re&s;olution, unwearied &s;upplies and fre&s;h anointings from Chri&s;t the Head of Influences, are needful to a right di&s;|charge of the Work of the Mini&s;try. The&s;e things &s;hould be &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider'd of, by tho&s;e who think of engaging in that mo&s;t weighty Work; that &s;o with due Preparations of Soul, and dependance on God, they may enter upon it. They &s;hould gladly u&s;e &s;uch helps, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> tend to fit them for, and quicken them to, a right di&s;charge of their duty. Among &s;uch helps, <HI>the fol|lowing Sermon</HI> may well be numbred. 'Twas Preach'd (tho' not &s;o large as 'tis now Printed) by the Worthy <HI>Author,</HI> on the Day of his Ordination; and 'tis now

Publi&s;h'd, in An&s;wer to Importunate Sollicitations, and at de&s;ire al&s;o the Enlargements were made. This Importunity argues not his backwardne&s;s to oblige Friends; but his mode&s;t opinion of his own perfor|mances, and his unwillingne&s;s to appear &s;o early in Print, (being very Young) le&s;t any &s;hould cen&s;ure him for too much forwardne&s;s. Such a cen&s;ure in this ca&s;e, would be very <HI>groundle&s;s.</HI> His principal de&s;ign in Studying this Sermon (as he declares) was not &s;o much the in|&s;tructing of <HI>others</HI> in the Work of the Mini&s;try, as the learning more clearly <HI>his own</HI> duty, and getting the &s;en&s;e of it more deeply impre&s;s'd on his <HI>own</HI> mind. But now 'tis Publi&s;h'd, I wi&s;h others may be as much bene|fited in Reading, as he was in Studying, of it. Tho&s;e Sermons, which are mo&s;t worthy of Commendation, have lea&s;t (or no) need of it; they commend them&s;elves; I think this may be numbred among &s;uch. Sure I am, the things contained herein, are highly worthy of the deepe&s;t and mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;ideration, of all Go&s;pel-Mi|ni&s;ters. I hope by peru&s;ing of it, I am more humbly &s;en&s;ible of my own deficiencies, then I was before; &amp; my de&s;ire is, that for the future I may be quicken'd to act in my Station, more agreeably to what is here very &s;olidly and cogently inculcated. I wi&s;h that all Mini&s;ters would (as this Sermon directs) make it their chief Bu&s;ine&s;s to <HI>Preach Chri&s;t,</HI> to &s;how Men their <HI>need</HI> of Him, &amp; His <HI>&s;uitablene&s;s</HI> &amp; <HI>&s;ufficiency</HI> for them; endeavouring that they may be rightly acquainted with Him, united to Him, and more conform'd in <HI>heart &amp; life</HI> to His <HI>Image, Pre|cepts</HI>
<PB N="iv" REF="001956_0005_0FBA400EAB2929F0">
&amp; <HI>Example.</HI> Thus to <HI>Preach Chri&s;t,</HI> is more the <HI>duty</HI> &amp; <HI>honour</HI> of Mini&s;ters, than to &s;how the greate&s;t <HI>Learning</HI> in other matters, or to get the greate&s;t <HI>applau&s;e</HI> for it. I e&s;teem it a rich mercy of God to our <HI>Land,</HI> that He continues and &s;miles on our <HI>College,</HI> &amp; thence &s;ends forth from time to time, able Mini&s;ters, to &s;erve His Holy Churches in this Wilderne&s;s, as well as in &s;ome other Places: Prai&s;e be to God the Father of Lights, for this Great Ble&s;&s;ing. This is the di&s;tingui&s;hing Glory of <HI>New-England,</HI> wherein it differs from all other Plantations and Di&s;per&s;ions of the Briti&s;h Empire. I Pray, God con|tinue our <HI>College</HI> a rich Ble&s;&s;ing to His Churches, as long as the Sun and Moon endure. And I e&s;teem it as a rich Ble&s;&s;ing to that Flock of our Lord Je&s;us, to which I am an unworthy Pa&s;tor, that the Worthy Author of this Ser|mon, (my Dear Brother &amp; Fellow Labourer,) was &s;o unanimou&s;ly and peaceably call'd to, and &s;ettled in, the Pa&s;toral Office among them. I Pray God, long to conti|nue his Life &amp; Health, and greatly &amp; con&s;tantly to in|crea&s;e the Gifts &amp; Graces of His Good Spirit to him; and to make him very Faithful &amp; Succe&s;sful in the weighty important Work he's engaged in, &amp; then to take him &s;afe, tho' late, to His Heavenly Kingdom. And as for the Flock them&s;elves, I Pray that they may be (and thanks be to God they are) a Ble&s;&s;ing and a Comfort to tho&s;e who watch for their Souls. <HI>My hearts de&s;ire and Prayer to God for them is, that they may be &s;aved;</HI> that tho&s;e who Preach and tho&s;e who hear, may meet with Joy at Chri&s;t's Right Hand in the Great Day.</P>
