<P>THE &s;ub&s;equent pages are the re&s;ult of ob&s;ervations made, during the period of three months, on a di&s;ea&s;e hitherto but little known in this part of the continent; and, although they have not a number of years' experience to &s;anction their accuracy, yet there are but few tropical practitioners, who have re&s;ided the greate&s;t part of their lives in countries where the di&s;ea&s;e generally occurs, that have &s;een &s;uch a number of ca&s;es as &s;ome of the medical gentlemen of this city who have enjoyed but an indifferent &s;hare of health during the melancholy &s;pace of three months.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="026747_0004_0FD18D29D61676F8">To acquire information, to alleviate the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of my fellow-citizens, and to procure the matter of this e&s;&s;ay, I have &s;pared no pains; nor have I &s;hrunk from &s;cenes truly dreadful, to make my&s;elf acquaint|ed with the leading features of this di&s;ea&s;e, and the different morbid phenomena after death, &s;o as to be enabled to narrate every circum&s;tance of importance and to di&s;crimi|nate the different &s;tages of the di&s;ea&s;e with as much preci&s;ion as the nature of it would admit; likewi&s;e, to point out the various appearances that tend to mark the favourable or unfavourable event, which are certainly of great importance to be a&s;certained both to the phy&s;ician and patient.</P>
<P>It is, however, much to be regretted, that tho&s;e circum&s;tances are &s;o little noticed by the different authors who have had re|peated

In the former, mo&s;t of them are very deficient. In the latter, few, I believe, can boa&s;t, with propriety, of their great &s;ucce&s;s, however different their methods of treating the di&s;ea&s;e may have been. For, &s;ome of tho&s;e practitioners, who wrote at an early period, recommend profu&s;e bleeding; others are more moderate in the u&s;e of that evacution; and &s;ome writers ad|vi&s;e the di&s;u&s;e of it altogether; whil&s;t Dr Mo&s;ely, a more modern author, recommends it, in an extreme degree, in particular ca&s;es&mdash; his words are "U&s;que ad deliquium animi." Such are the opinions of the various authors on the &s;ubject of vene&s;ection in this di&s;ea&s;e;

but want of lei&s;ure and free acce&s;s to the va|rious medical publications, on this &s;ubject, during the prevalence of the malignant fever in this city, deprived me of an opportunity of con&s;ulting many books on the occa&s;ion. This circum&s;tance prevented the influence of partiality or prejudice on my mind re&s;pect|ing the nece&s;&s;ary treatment. I was, there|fore, obliged to &s;eek, through my own ob|&s;ervations on the &s;ymptoms, and the appear|ance after death, what appeared to me the mo&s;t rational method of cure.</P>
<P>I have added to this e&s;&s;ay an account of &s;ome di&s;&s;ectious made at the ho&s;pital at Bu&s;h|hill, during the prevalence of the di&s;ea&s;e, on &s;uch patients as were affected with it to an extreme degree.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE malignant and contagious fever, which has &s;o lately committed &s;uch deva&s;ta|tion upon the inhabitants of this city, ap|pears, from all the information that could be obtained from the different publications on di&s;ea&s;es incident to mankind between the tro|pics, to be one nearly re&s;embling, in its mo&s;t leading features, the yellow-fever of the We&s;t India I&s;lands, and of the coa&s;t of Africa <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Doctor Williams ob&s;erved the di&s;ea&s;e on the coa&s;t of Afri|ca. See his e&s;&s;ay on the &s;ubject, page 11.</NOTE>; of which places I believe it to be a native. For
<PB N="2" REF="026747_0010_0FD1BDC58B54A668">
we have no authentic and accurate de&s;cription of it that I am acquainted with in the writings of authors on the di&s;ea&s;es of the Ea&s;t Indies, or province of Canton in China, where the &s;ea&s;ons of the latter are &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the tropics. Various have been the appellations given to the late contagious fever, according to the different nations among whom it has occurred, and to the mo&s;t uniform and con|&s;tant &s;ymptoms they had ob&s;erved in its pro|gre&s;s. As a yellow &s;uffu&s;ion &s;ometimes takes place in the eyes and &s;kin, it has by &s;ome au|thors been termed a yellow or putrid bilious fever: the latter from it's &s;ometimes having a &s;eptic tendency. As neither of the&s;e &s;ymp|toms are con&s;tantly ob&s;erved in the cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, there may be &s;ome impropriety in the terms, however univer&s;ally they may have been adopted. By the French it is call|ed "la maladie de Siam," from their &s;up|po&s;ing the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e to have appeared in the kingdom of Siam in the Ea&s;t Indies. It is, likewi&s;e, called by the French
"la fievre
<PB N="3" REF="026747_0011_0FD1BDC74ECCE120">
matelotte" becau&s;e &s;ea-faring people were &s;uppo&s;ed to be mo&s;t &s;ubject to it. The Spa|niards call it "vomito preto" or the black vomiting, from one of it's dangerous &s;ymp|toms. Such has been the diver&s;ity of name for this di&s;ea&s;e. And with re&s;pect to it's origin in this city, it has been a little &s;imilar. Some have &s;uppo&s;ed it to be indigenous and the offspring of vegetable putrefaction. O|thers, that it was imported from the We&s;t Indies. Of the latter opinion I am clearly, for that is the mo&s;t probable, and is &s;up|ported by the greate&s;t number of facts. When it appeared before in this country, which has been at &s;ix different periods, exclu&s;ive of that of the la&s;t year, it could, with facility, be traced to have been imported from the We&s;t Indies. It vi&s;ited Charle&s;ton in South Caro|lina four times according to Doctor Lining, viz. in 1732, 1739, 1745, and 1748. It like|wi&s;e appears from Dr Lind <NOTE PLACE="foot">Lind on Infection, page 293.</NOTE> that it was in|troduced
<PB N="4" REF="026747_0012_0FD1BDC89F048188">
here in 1740, by a trunk of wearing apparel; and, from the notes of Dr Redman, pre&s;ident of the college of phy&s;icians, on who&s;e integrity I can depend, we are inform|ed that it was brought here from the Havan|nah in 1762, by a mariner who arrived &s;ick. From that time it has never been ob&s;erved in this city until la&s;t year, when it fir&s;t ap|peared on the third of Augu&s;t, in Water|&s;treet, between Mulberry and Sa&s;&s;afras Streets, at a boarding-hou&s;e much frequented by &s;ea|men, many of whom belonged to the Xebec privateer, Sans Culottes, of Nantz, that had ju&s;t come off from a crui&s;e with the &s;hip Flora her prize; the crew of which ve&s;&s;el, from every circum&s;tance that could be collect|ed, appears to have brought the di&s;ea&s;e indi|rectly from the We&s;t Indies into this city by exchanging part of her crew for that of a prize &s;he had taken from the We&s;t India I&s;lands, where the di&s;ea&s;e was well known to rage with great mortality.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="026747_0013_0FD1BDCA049C1D60">The people mo&s;t generally affected with this di&s;ea&s;e were the inhabitants of Philadel|phia, and natives of America from different parts of the Continent. No condition, or &s;i|tuation in life was exempted from it's vio|lence. The timid of both &s;exes, the mo&s;t healthy, and tho&s;e who &s;eemed to have all the vigor of youth on their &s;ide, fell victims to it. No age &s;carcely e&s;caped; from the child in the cradle up to confirmed manhood, and even from that to extreme old age. Women, during ge&s;tation, appeared to me to be more &s;u&s;ceptible of it than tho&s;e who were not in that &s;tate; and, in almo&s;t all, it produced a|bortion or mi&s;carriage&mdash;few, I believe, reco|vered from it; owing, probably, to their &s;y&s;|tems being more di&s;po&s;ed to violent inflam|mation than tho&s;e of others. It was, how|ever, more fatal to the male than the female &s;ex. But the mo&s;t chearful, fearle&s;s, and gay, of both &s;exes, frequently e&s;caped it, as like|wi&s;e did ideots, and tho&s;e people who, for a con&s;iderable length of time, had been a little deranged.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="026747_0014_0FD1BDD0840FE2F0">Strangers were very &s;eldom attacked, par|ticularly tho&s;e from the We&s;t India I&s;lands where it generally affects foreigners. But here they were &s;eldom &s;u&s;ceptible of it. Blacks of every de&s;cription, were le&s;s liable to it than the white inhabitants; and the negroes originally from the coa&s;t of Africa were &s;carcely ever affected <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jack&s;on of Jamaica ob&s;erves, that be never &s;aw a Negro or a Creole with the di&s;ea&s;e who had lived con&s;tantly in their native country.

<P>During the fir&s;t two weeks of it's appear|ance in this city, it was almo&s;t entirely con|fined to that part of Water-&s;treet where it commenced; and the inhabitants of that neighbourhood were &s;eized in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. For the fir&s;t ten days there were &s;eldom two attacked with the di&s;ea&s;e in the &s;ame hou&s;e, which induced &s;ome to think that it was not contagious; but they were &s;oon &s;orrowfully

mi&s;taken, for, it became general among the families of that neighbourhood, and not long after &s;pread it's mortal influence to different parts of the city, carrying off a great part and even the whole of &s;ome families, and pro|duced &s;uch de&s;truction, that, in the &s;pace of three months, upwards of four thou&s;and and forty eight per&s;ons were con&s;igned to eter|nity. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Carey's account of the ri&s;e and progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e.</NOTE></P>
<P>It was a &s;ingular fact, that when carried into the country, it never was, but in one in&s;tance, that I am acquainted with, propa|gated beyond the per&s;on who carried it; al|though &s;ome of the family officiated as nur&s;es, and even &s;lept in the &s;ame bed with the pa|tient until the day of his death. This was the ca&s;e, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, during the &s;everal times it prevailed in Charle&s;ton, South Caro|lina; and, like many other contagious di&s;|ea&s;es, it does not appear ever to affect the
<PB N="8" REF="026747_0016_0FD1BDD350B33CF0">
&s;ame per&s;on twice. Although careful en|quiry has been made by &s;everal of my medi|cal friends and my&s;elf, it only appears that &s;ome of the patients had a &s;light relap&s;e of fe|ver, but without any of the di&s;tingui&s;hing &s;ymptoms of the di&s;ea&s;e, and very &s;oon re|covered. This I have frequently ob&s;erved in my own practice, and, likewi&s;e, in that of my friends&mdash;but I have never remarked a &s;econd attack of the di&s;ea&s;e, however con|&s;tantly the patient may have been afterwards expo&s;ed to the contagion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>See Phy&s;ical and Literary E&s;&s;ays of Edinburgh, vol ii.</P>
<P>Upon &s;trict inquiry among mariners and others who had the di&s;ea&s;e in the We&s;t Indies and tho&s;e inhabitants who had it before when it vi&s;ited this city, I cannot find one that was affected with the di&s;ea&s;e during it's late prevalence al|though much expo&s;ed to the contagion.</P></NOTE>. The&s;e circum|&s;tances are corroborated by the accurate Dr Lining of Charle&s;ton; and, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure, by &s;ome of the tropical writers, parti|cularly Jack&s;on of Jamaica, who goes &s;o far as to &s;ay that

<P>Having thus far briefly traced the ri&s;e and progre&s;s of this di&s;ea&s;e, which was beyond a doubt, highly contagious; I come now to con&s;ider, under what circum&s;tances the conta|gion was communicated;&mdash;How long it was, after apparently receiving the infection, be|fore it produced its effects;&mdash;And in what manner it acted on the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>The&s;e que&s;tions apply to contagion in ge|neral, and are involved in much ob&s;curity and doubt; and it is probable that they never will be &s;atisfactorily &s;olved.</P>
<P>With regard to the fir&s;t propo&s;ition, it may be ob&s;erved, that like other contagious di&s;|ea&s;es,
<PB N="10" REF="026747_0018_0FD1BDD6DBDBBE90">
this &s;eemed to be communicated in three di&s;tinct ways&mdash;
<LIST>
<ITEM>Fir&s;t&mdash;by immediate contact with the pa|tient's body.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Secondly&mdash;through the medium of the air which &s;urrounded him within a limited di&s;tance. And,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Thirdly&mdash;by bodies of different kinds being expo&s;ed to, and as it were, drink|ing up the matter of contagion, hav|ing a power of retaining it in an ac|tive &s;tate, and communicating it to animated bodies.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I believe the di&s;ea&s;e was communicated in the&s;e &s;everal ways. As to the fir&s;t, viz. that of coming in contact with the patient's body, this was the mo&s;t certain way of receiving it. I am not clear what particular &s;tage was the mo&s;t dangerous; but from &s;uch information as could be collected, during the prevalence of the di&s;ea&s;e, it appeared to be the advanced &s;tages;
<PB N="11" REF="026747_0019_0FD1BDDA04E8BAA8">
although I knew a nur&s;e, who I am almo&s;t certain received the infection from a patient, during the operation of an emetic; for the matter thrown up by vomiting emitted a pe|culiarly foetid &s;mell, which affected her &s;oon after &s;he had carried it out of the room. Ear|ly the next day &s;he was attacked with all the &s;ymptoms of the di&s;ea&s;e. From this in&s;tance, and &s;everal more I could adduce if it were ne|ce&s;&s;ary, of tho&s;e who received the infection at a later period, during the inflammatory &s;tage; is it not probable that all patients, under &s;imilar circum&s;tances are capable of commu|nicating the di&s;ea&s;e, during the fir&s;t and &s;e|cond days? But it is infinitely more conta|gious in the latter &s;tages than in the early period.</P>
<P>The &s;econd mode of receiving the infection, was from the matter of contagion ari&s;ing from the morbid body impregnating the at|mo&s;phere of the chamber, and being applied to &s;u&s;ceptible con&s;titutions. This, I believe,
<PB N="12" REF="026747_0020_0FD1BDDBA46FB2A0">
can only take place within a certain &s;mall di&s;|tance of the per&s;on affected, for in propor|tion as it became diffu&s;ed in the atmo&s;phere, it mu&s;t lo&s;e it's activity, and be &s;o far ex|hau&s;ted as not to be able to produce the di&s;|ea&s;e. Therefore people in walking the &s;treets, are &s;ecure from being contaminated by the atmo&s;phere which &s;urrounds them; for, al|though a number of articles, charged as it were, with the matter of contagion, be expo&s;ed in the open air; yet the effluvia i&s;&s;uing from them, would be &s;o much diffu&s;ed, corrected and modified, through that immen&s;e &s;pace, as &s;carcely to be able to have any effect, ex|cept within the contagious atmo&s;phere, ex|tending but a &s;mall di&s;tance from the articles them&s;elves. The danger of going abroad in the city, during the prevalence of a conta|gious di&s;ea&s;e, is from coming in contact with the clothes of tho&s;e who had recently left the chambers of the &s;ick.</P>
<P>The third mode of receiving the infection, was from &s;ub&s;tances which had imbibed the
<PB N="13" REF="026747_0021_0FD1BDDE510EE9B0">
matter of contagion, having the power of re|taining and communicating it in an active &s;tate, &s;uch as woollens, furs, &amp;c. under par|ticular circum&s;tances, as when excited by heat and applied to the healthy &s;y&s;tem, have a power of inducing the di&s;ea&s;e. In this man|ner it is probably conveyed into different countries, in a quie&s;cent &s;tate; after which, being excited by heat or any other agent, it exerts its baneful infl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce on people within the &s;phere of it's action; from which it is &s;oon communicated and &s;pread far and wide. In this way the contagion of the &s;mall-pox may be communicated&mdash;it may in like manner be retained from &s;ea&s;on to &s;ea&s;on, for in|oculation. By the la&s;t mode of communica|tion, many of the inhabitants of this city re|ceived the contagion of the yellow fever&mdash; from lying on beds upon which people had died, and &s;ome from even handling the bed|clothes of the di&s;ea&s;ed before they had been aired. I am acquainted with a gentleman of this city, who, in all probability, received the
<PB N="14" REF="026747_0022_0FD1BDE3999DA9B8">
infection, from lying on the &s;acking bottom and bed&s;tead on which his wife had died.</P>
<P>Our next propo&s;ition is&mdash;In what length of time the di&s;ea&s;e commences after a per&s;on has been expo&s;ed to and received the infection. This was variable and difficult to be deter|mined; for many expo&s;ed them&s;elves &s;o re|peatedly that it was not po&s;&s;ible to a&s;certain the exact time at which they received the contagion: although in &s;ome, from the mo&s;t accurate information that could be obtained, it was from nine until fourteen days after they were &s;uppo&s;ed to have received the infection. Tho&s;e, who&s;e apprehen&s;ions were much aug|mented by the dread of dying, &s;eemed to have the di&s;ea&s;e &s;ooner completely formed, after re|ceiving the contagion, than tho&s;e who did not la|bour under that anxious &s;tate of mind. But all that can be &s;aid on this &s;ubject is involved in great uncertainty. There &s;eems however to be &s;ome analogy between this and other conta|gious di&s;ea&s;es in re&s;pect to the time of it's
<PB N="15" REF="026747_0023_0FD1BDE7F36541D0">
commencement after the infection is taken. For as the &s;mall-pox, gonorrhea, &amp;c. re|quire a certain length of time after expo&s;ure to and reception of the infection, before the di&s;ea&s;e is formed&mdash;&s;o does this. Some con|&s;titutions &s;eem hardly &s;u&s;ceptible of tho&s;e di&s;|ea&s;es, however much they may have been ex|po&s;ed to their influence. But the con&s;titu|tions of &s;uch people are not often found a|mong the variety of mankind; yet during the prevalence of the late fever there were numerous in&s;tances of per&s;ons who had not been expo&s;ed to its influence before, that were not affected by it. The&s;e in&s;tances are, however, particularly confined to the black in|habitants, with but few exceptions of a dif|ferent colour. There was not one in&s;tance of a French We&s;t-Indian's having the di&s;ea&s;e, owing probably to having had it before; al|though tho&s;e from Europe were as &s;u&s;ceptible of it as the inhabitants of America.</P>

<P>The eyes were generally highly &s;uffu&s;ed, exhibiting the appearance of a painted eye or one minutely injected, accompanied with a &s;en&s;ation as if irritated by &s;and, and generally an aver&s;ion to light. This I have frequently ob&s;erved to take place during the rigor al|though

<HEAD>OF THE METHOD OF CURE.</HEAD>
<P>IN the cure of the malignant fever, three indications appeared nece&s;&s;ary: fir&s;t, to mo|derate the inflammatory action; &s;econdly, to remove or alleviate certain di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;ymptoms which generally occurred, more or le&s;s, through the &s;everal &s;tages of the di&s;|ea&s;e; thirdly, to &s;upport the tone and vigor of the &s;y&s;tem. In effecting the fir&s;t indica|tion, the various parts of the antiphlogi&s;tic regimen &s;eemed admirably well adapted. In employing the debilitating powers, a judg|ment may be formed by the degree of tone and inflammatory action prevalent in the
<PB N="43" REF="026747_0051_0FD1BE2B35E827D8">
&s;y&s;tem; and the danger of the di&s;ea&s;e pa&s;&s;ing into a &s;tate of direct or indirect debility &s;hould be &s;teadily kept in view. The for|mer from the u&s;e of too copious evacua|tions, and the latter from a deficiency of them; for it is an ea&s;y matter to dimini&s;h the vigor of the &s;y&s;tem, but a very difficult one to rear it when reduced too low: there|fore every endeavour &s;hould be exerted to a|void the two extremes, for they are both accompanied with imminent danger.

<P>The fir&s;t indication was mo&s;t effectually an&s;wered by the different cla&s;&s;es of evacuants; among the mo&s;t efficacious was brachial venae&s;ection.</P>
<P>About the tenth of Augu&s;t, which was &s;hortly after the di&s;ea&s;e made its appearance in this city, bleeding was not attended with

&s;ucce&s;s, at lea&s;t among the &s;ick under my care; therefore the practice was di&s;conti|nued, and I tru&s;ted, with mo&s;t of my medi|cal brethren, to the milder cla&s;s of evacu|ants until the 12th of September. After having di&s;&s;ected &s;everal patients, in conjunc|tion with my friend Dr Phy&s;ic, and on finding the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines highly inflamed, as will appear from the &s;ubjoined di&s;&s;ections, I then, re&s;umed the practice of bleeding upon good grounds and with evidently better effect.&mdash;The quantity of blood to be taken away was regulated by the violence of the &s;ymptoms, age, &s;ex and habit of body; for, tho&s;e who were very corpulent did not bear evacuations near &s;o well as tho&s;e of a &s;pare make. But no certain rule can ab&s;olutely be laid down, with re&s;pect to the quantity of blood to be drawn, and whenever it is attempted it mu&s;t be &s;ubject to con&s;iderable error, notwith&s;tanding the number of ounces to be ab&s;tracted has been dictated by &s;ome authors, who&s;e opinions on this &s;ubject are

which nearly re&s;embled that de&s;cribed under the appellation of the putrid bilious fever of the We&s;t India i&s;lands, I was influenced, in the ab&s;traction of blood, by the ten&s;ion and fulne&s;s of the pul&s;e, the &s;ea&s;on of the year and other circum&s;tances previou&s;ly ob&s;erved, together with the abatement the &s;ick experi|enced of the &s;ymptoms during the flowing of the blood. But it was very &s;eldom that one bleeding, however profu&s;e it may have been, would put an end to this di&s;ea&s;e; al|though the pain in the head and back may be much mitigated. Yet they too often re|turned with additional violence, at which time, if the pul&s;e continued full and tolera|bly ten&s;e, the &s;trength not much impaired, a &s;ufficient quantity of blood may be taken away to procure an alleviation of the &s;ymp|toms, which &s;hould be repeated as often as they recur in the inflammatory &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e, but it &s;eldom appeared nece&s;&s;ary to be done later than the end of the third day, when it was employed at a more advanced

period particularly near the time the di&s;ea&s;e was pa&s;&s;ing into its &s;econd &s;tage, it invaria|bly increa&s;ed the train of terrible &s;ymptoms which mark this period, with a &s;inking in the pul&s;e that no human effort was able to &s;upport. The blood drawn in this &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e very &s;eldom perfectly &s;eparated into &s;erum and cra&s;&s;amentum; when it did the former was nearly of a natural colour, though &s;mall in quantity in proportion to the latter, the cra&s;&s;amentum was generally of a florid arterial colour, tender in the cour&s;e of the warm weather, as the cool weather ad|vanced and the di&s;ea&s;e became more inflam|matory it was &s;izy in &s;ome ca&s;es, with a proportionable degree of contraction of its &s;uperior circumference, exhibiting a cup like appearance. This was generally in propor|tion to the den&s;ity of the cra&s;&s;amentum and firmne&s;s of the buffy &s;ub&s;tance, though &s;ome|times during the warm weather there was a thick tender &s;izy coat on its upper &s;urface without the cup or as it is generally called &s;alt box appearance. When blood was drawn during the yellow &s;uffu&s;ion of the
<PB N="48" REF="026747_0056_0FD1BE3906D2E708">

But to return to the cure at the &s;ame time that great attention was paid to blood-letting, other remedies were not neglected, e&s;pecially whatever contribu|ted to dimini&s;h the quantity of fluids in the &s;y&s;tem and carried off the redundant matter in the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages, was proportionably effi|cacious in dimini&s;hing the inflammatory action, &s;uch as cathartics and other evacu|ants, which were employed as being &s;econd|arily the mo&s;t powerful remedies, particular|ly when alternated with bleeding, which ap|peared to be the mo&s;t judicious way of u&s;ing them, tho&s;e that were preferred were &s;uch on who&s;e powerful action reliance could be had and when the &s;tomach was &s;ick required but a &s;mall quantity to an&s;wer the purpo&s;e at the &s;ame time being agreeable to the palate.

Calomel po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es mo&s;t of tho&s;e properties, and under certain circum&s;tances could be admini&s;tered with the greate&s;t advantage. This medicine was fir&s;t employed here in large do&s;es by Doctor Ru&s;h, and after|wards generally adopted by the practitioners of this city. It &s;hould be given in large do&s;es until it has the de&s;ired effect and &s;hould be expedited in it's operation by giving laxative gly&s;ters; when the functions of the &s;tomach were not much deranged which was &s;ometimes the ca&s;e, the &s;aline purgatives were made u&s;e of, &s;uch as &s;al Glauberi, which were powerful, le&s;s &s;timulat|ing than the calomel, and of cour&s;e better an|tiphlogi&s;tics, an&s;wering the purpo&s;e equally well, as the object was merely to reduce the energy of the &s;y&s;tem and carry off the bilious matter.</P>
<P>During the time tho&s;e remedies are em|ployed it is hardly nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve that

the patient &s;hould ab&s;tain from all prepara|tions of animal food, and when any thing is required it &s;hould be gruel, panada, &amp;c. he &s;hould u&s;e cool diluting drinks, &s;uch as barley water, apple water, and tho&s;e that are mild and bland; he may be indulged with &s;mall quantities of ripe fruits, which are a|greeable and beneficial by tending to keep the bowels open. Emeties have been &s;ome|times employed in this &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e with a view to evacuate the contents of the &s;tomach, but they are &s;eldom u&s;ed with ad|vantage, for their highly &s;timulating power almo&s;t always increa&s;ed every &s;ymptom, which of cour&s;e precluded their u&s;e.</P>
<P>To relieve the violent pain in the head, bli&s;ters were employed after general evacu|ation had been made u&s;e of as far as appeared advi&s;able, but previous to their application to the neck there were &s;everal cupping-gla&s;&s;es &s;et on the part to be bli&s;tered, this mode of practice generally afforded con&s;iderable relief.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="026747_0059_0FD1BE435AB01B88">It was the cu&s;tom of &s;ome of the French phy&s;icians in this city to wrap the patient's body in a blanket that had been wrung out of warm vinegar and water in order to induce &s;weat and a &s;olution of the di&s;ea&s;e. The former it did &s;ometimes partially effect, but generally with aggravation of almo&s;t every other &s;ymptom. In addition to this practice they frequently gave a few grains of nitre and camphor in every &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e, but this appeared trifling with the patient at the expence of his life.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the chambers of the &s;ick, they &s;hould be &s;pacious and airy, kept cool, and frequently &s;prinkled with vinegar; great attention &s;hould be paid to the&s;e circum|&s;tances as they are of infinite importance to tho&s;e who frequent the apartments of the &s;ick, and are highly conducive to the cure of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>

come now to a con&s;ideration of the &s;econd, viz. to alleviate or remove certain di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;ymptoms, &s;uch as violent vomiting, co&s;tive|ne&s;s, flatulency, great re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s and want of &s;leep, together with the means u&s;ed to divert the deep de&s;ponding &s;tate of mind of the patient.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, to moderate the exce&s;&s;ive vomiting too often baffled the art and &s;agacity of eve|ry practitioner, however, various means were employed to effect it, which may be divided into external and internal; among the for|mer was bli&s;tering the different parts of the body, particularly the region of the &s;tomach. This remedy from its obvious good effect in cholera morbus would have induced mo&s;t people to conjecture that it would have been beneficial in this di&s;ea&s;e; but from repeated trials it &s;eemed to have but little influence on the &s;tate of the &s;tomach. Bli&s;ters have been recommended to be applied to the legs by Dr Hume of Jamaica, from which he experi|enced
<PB N="53" REF="026747_0061_0FD1BE49B6CE2E90">
very good effects, but however &s;ervice|able this mode of practice may have been in the We&s;t Indies, it appeared here only to torture the patient's feelings without the lea&s;t abatement of the vomiting; warm bathing was employed in this &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e, &s;ometimes with a mitigation of the vomiting, but frequently it increa&s;ed the &s;ickne&s;s at the &s;tomach and produced &s;yncope. In &s;ome ca|&s;es, the application of flannels wrung out of a warm and &s;trong infu&s;ion of aromatics and applied con&s;tantly to the region of the &s;tomach, were &s;ometimes &s;erviceable, but external ap|plications taken in the aggregate &s;eemed &s;el|dom to promi&s;e much advantage.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to internal remedies, almo&s;t every antiemetic was employed that the expe|rience of phy&s;icians had found u&s;eful, but frequently without having the de&s;ired effect, &s;uch as the &s;aline mixture in the &s;tate of ef|ferve&s;cence; the infu&s;ion of rad.

<P><PB N="55" REF="026747_0063_0FD1BE4C87BE5C60">Fre&s;h buttermilk was frequently found grateful to the &s;ick and very beneficial as an antiemetic even when from the &s;ymptoms it might be concluded that the &s;tomach was highly inflamed.

thrown up. During the exce&s;&s;ive &s;ickne&s;s at the &s;tomach in the progre&s;s of this di&s;ea&s;e, it may be ob&s;erved that generally the mo&s;t a|greeable medicine and drinks were le&s;s fre|quently rejected than tho&s;e of an unplea&s;ant quality, for no &s;ooner did a draught of any liquid reach the &s;tomach than it was in&s;tantly rejected with violence, it is not to be appre|hended from the quality but merely from the quantity, therefore the patient &s;hould not take more than a table-&s;poonful at a time, his own feeling with re&s;pect to fulne&s;s and &s;ick|ne&s;s at the &s;tomach &s;hould always determine the frequency and quantity of drinks to be taken, however in&s;atiably thir&s;ty he may be, in conjunction with the&s;e precautions the body &s;hould be kept as quiet as po&s;&s;ible, for the lea&s;t accelerated motion of it frequently brought on a paroxy&s;m of vomiting. During this perturbed &s;tate of the &s;tomach Dr Mo&s;e|ly thinks a diaphoretic plan &s;hould be adopt|ed, with James's powders, in order to relieve the internal irritation by revul&s;ion, and enable

<P>To remove co&s;tivene&s;s and flatulency, which were extremely di&s;tre&s;&s;ing through the cour&s;e of this di&s;ea&s;e, was always a very difficult matter to accompli&s;h, particularly when there

was much &s;ickne&s;s at the &s;tomach, with vo|miting, for the inte&s;tines were frequently ve|ry &s;luggi&s;h in their action, and the &s;tomach generally rejected every cla&s;s of purgative medicines. When this was the ca&s;e, there was no alternative but that of keeping the bowels open by purgative or laxative gly&s;ters, and tho&s;e were &s;ubject to con&s;iderable incon|venience when they could be admini&s;tered, which was not often the ca&s;e, for they fre|quently cleared but the lower part of the in|te&s;tines, whil&s;t tho&s;e approximating the &s;to|mach were generally di&s;tended with faeces, and was an ince&s;&s;ant &s;ource of irritation to the &s;ympathizing &s;tomach. Therefore when|ever there was a chance of &s;ucce&s;s in the ad|mini&s;tration of purgative medicines they were always attempted, for they generally cleared the whole tract of inte&s;tinal canal, and fre|quently procured a mitigation of the vomit|ing, but if they were rejected, they were not frequently repeated, for fear of exhau&s;ting the &s;trength of the patient without contribut|ing
<PB N="59" REF="026747_0067_0FD1BE5B368B8810">
to his relief. By thus keeping the inte&s;tinal canal clear of faeces, you in &s;ome mea&s;ure ob|viated flatulency. But in an advanced period of the di&s;ea&s;e, the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines were &s;o much debilitated, that they frequently had not energy &s;ufficient, when apparently clear of faeces, to expel the wind either upwards or downwards, but it continued as it were &s;ta|tionary tormenting the patient. During this &s;tate when the &s;tomach was tolerably tran|quil, a &s;trong infu&s;ion of &s;emen faeneculi was admini&s;tered mixed in a &s;mall quantity of brandy with advantage, particularly when alternated with &s;ome agreeable tonic, &s;uch as the mucilaginous vitriolic mixture already recommended, if nothing contraindicated its u&s;e, or a &s;mall quantity of a &s;trong infu&s;ion of &s;pices, which &s;ometimes afforded relief, but tho&s;e &s;ymptoms too frequently baffled every attempt to remove them.</P>

<P>I come now to the third and la&s;t indica|tion which was of all others the mo&s;t difficult to accompli&s;h, viz. to &s;upport the &s;inking tone and peri&s;hing vigor of the &s;y&s;tem, this in|dication is applicable to the &s;econd, but more particularly to the la&s;t &s;tage of the di&s;|ea&s;e, for the latter being an augmentation of the &s;ymptoms of the former, &s;ometimes much diver&s;ified, requiring more powerful remedies. Whenever a change was perceived in the &s;y&s;|tem indicating that debility was commencing, the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e mu&s;t be con&s;idered as materially different, con&s;equently requiring a particular mode of treatment; the patient &s;hould not be re&s;tricted to a vegetable diet or watery drinks, e&s;pecially if there are no vio|lent &s;ymptoms indicating inflammation of the

This practice was more expedient if the pa|tient could take &s;ome nouri&s;hment that was light and agreeable, &s;uch as panada or gruel, or if there was a &s;light return of appetite, &s;ome preparation of animal food &s;hould be given, &s;uch as weak broth, and at times a few oy&s;ters, if the &s;tomach would bear them; however, great caution &s;hould be ob&s;erved in making u&s;e of &s;olid food.
