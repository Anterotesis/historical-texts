<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>IT is now about a year and an half, &s;ince I was de&s;ired by the General A&s;&s;ociation of Mini&s;ters in this State to publi&s;h the following &s;ermons. As the publication has been &s;o long delayed, I look upon my&s;elf bound to render the rea&s;ons of this delay to the public in general, to the a&s;&s;ociation and &s;ub|&s;cribers in particular.&mdash;At the time that the de&s;ire of the a&s;&s;ociation was made known to me, the &s;tate of our currency was &s;uch, that I could not immediately determine, in what manner it was be&s;t to &s;et on foot the &s;ub&s;cription. This being at length determined, the papers could not be circulated, &s;ub&s;criptions procured and returned in a &s;horter time than &s;everal months. After this a further delay was occa&s;ioned by the difficulty of procuring paper. However this difficulty was al&s;o at la&s;t &s;urmounted, and the printer had begun the work, when on the fifth of July la&s;t, the Briti&s;h troops made their de&s;cent on New-Haven. This event entirely broke up the work; and as we have been con|&s;tantly expo&s;ed to another vi&s;it from the enemy, the printer did not judge it prudent to re&s;ume it. Things being &s;o circum&s;tanced, I was obliged to &s;eek out for another printer; and tho&s;e at Hartford being mo&s;t conveniently &s;ituated, I app<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ed to them. They were willing to undertake the bu&s;i|ne&s;s, but having work already in hand which would nece&s;|&s;arily con&s;ume &s;everal months, they could not begin this, till <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> pre&s;ent time; but will now enter on it immediately, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> di&s;patch it as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible.&mdash;By this peculiar &s;eries

of event<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, the publication of the&s;e &s;ermons, hath been thus long deferred.</HI></P>
<P><HI>As to the &s;ermons them&s;elves, they were not tran&s;cribed with any view to a publication in this country. In the year</HI> 1773, <HI>I was de&s;ired by a gentleman in Scotland, to tran&s;cribe a number of the author's &s;ermons on &s;ome of the mo&s;t plain, practical and experimental &s;ubjects, that they might be printed there. The reader will hence &s;ee, that it was not the de&s;ign to pick out the mo&s;t curious and elabo|rate di&s;cour&s;es, but tho&s;e of a different &s;tamp. Among the very numerous di&s;cour&s;es on practical and experimental &s;ub|jects, out of which I was to choo&s;e, it was no ea&s;y ta&s;k, to determine which to publi&s;h, and which to omit. And dif|ferent per&s;ons would no doubt, in this ca&s;e, judge different|ly. Many &s;ermons equally worthy of the light as the&s;e, were omitted; and perhaps &s;ome that were more worthy: Yet it is hoped that the public will judge the&s;e not unwor|thy of their acceptance and attention; if &s;o, that may lay a foundation for the publication of others in due time.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The reader cannot be in&s;en&s;ible of the di&s;advantages at|tending all po&s;thumous works, e&s;pecially &s;ermons, which are generally prepared only for the next &s;abbath, and for a par|ticular congregation, and often in great ha&s;te and amid&s;t many avocations. Yet if in the&s;e &s;ermons he &s;hall find the mo&s;t important truths exhibited, and pre&s;&s;ed home on the con&s;cience with that pungency which tends to awaken, convince, humble and edify; if he &s;hall find that &s;erious &s;train of piety, which in &s;pite of him&s;elf, forces upon him, a &s;erious frame of mind; if in the peru&s;al he cannot but be a&s;hamed and alarmed at him&s;elf, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure feel the reality and weight of eternal things; if at lea&s;t, he like Agrippa &s;hall be almo&s;t per&s;uaded to be a chri&s;tian:&mdash;I pre&s;ume he will not grudge the expence of the purcha&s;e, nor the time requi&s;ite to peru&s;e what is now offered him. The&s;e if I mi&s;take not, are the great ends to be aimed at in

<P N="1">1. WHAT it was that GOD commanded Noah, to which the&s;e words refer.

3. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> ob&s;erve Noah's obedience. He obey|ed GOD: <HI>Thus did Noah.</HI> And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> was thorough and univer&s;al: <HI>According to</HI> ALL, <HI>that GOD commanded him, &s;o did he.</HI> He not only began, but he went through this work, which GOD had commanded him to undertake for his &s;alvation from the flood. To this obedience the apo&s;tle refers in the 11th ch. of H b. 7th v. By faith Noah being warned of GOD of things not &s;een as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the &s;aving of his hou&s;e.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD>DOCTRINE.</HEAD>
<P>WE &s;hould be willing to engage in, and go through with great undertakings, in order to our own &s;alva|tion.</P>
<P>THE building of the ark, which was enjoined up|on Noah, that he and his family might be &s;aved, was a great undertaking: The ark was a building of va&s;t &s;ize; the length of it being three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits. A cubit, till of late, was by learned men reckoned to be equal to a foot and an half of our mea&s;ure. But lately &s;ome learned men of our nation have travelled into Egypt, and other antient countries, and have mea&s;ured &s;ome antient buildings there, which are of &s;everal thou&s;and years &s;tanding, and of which antient hi&s;tories give us the dimen&s;ions in cubits; particularly the pyramids of Egypt, which are &s;tanding entire at this day. By mea&s;uring the&s;e, and by comparing the mea&s;ure in feet, with the anti|ent accounts of their mea&s;ure in cubits, a cubit is found to be almo&s;t two and twenty inches. There|fore learned men more lately reckon a cubit much longer than they did formerly. So that the ark reckon|ed
<PB N="9" REF="016767_0007_0F9E1EDE86AA6BC0">
&s;o much longer every way, will appear to be almo&s;t of double the bulk, which was formerly a&s;cribed to it. According to this computation of the cubit, it was more than five hundred and fifty feet long, about ninety feet broad, and about fifty feet in height.</P>
<P>To build &s;uch a &s;tructure, with all tho&s;e apartments and divi&s;ions in it which were nece&s;&s;ary, and in &s;uch a manner as to be fit to float upon the water, for &s;o long a time, was a great undertaking. It was a work of much time, taking Noah with all the workmen he employed an hundred and twenty years, or therea|bouts, to build it. For &s;o long it was, that the &s;pi|rit of GOD &s;trove, and the long-&s;uffering of GOD waited on the old world; as you may &s;ee in Gen. vi. 3. My &s;pirit &s;hall not always &s;trive with man; yet his days &s;hall be one hundred and twenty years. All this while the ark was a prepairing, as appears by I Pet. iii. 20. When once the long &s;uffering of GOD waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a pre|paring. It was a long time that Noah con&s;tantly employed him&s;elf in this bu&s;ine&s;s. Men would e&s;|teem that undertaking very great, which &s;hould keep them con&s;tantly employed even for one half of that time.</P>
<P>NOAH mu&s;t have had a great and con&s;tant care upon his mind for the&s;e one hundred and twenty years, in &s;uperintending this work, and &s;eeing that all was done exactly according to the directions, which GOD had given him.</P>
<P>NOT only was Noah him&s;elf continually employed, but it is judged by learned men from the computa|tions which they have made, that it required a great number of workmen to be con&s;tantly employed, dur|ing all that time, in procuring, and collecting, and fitting the materials, and in putting them together in
<PB N="10" REF="016767_0008_0F9E1EDE99A94660">
due form. How great a thing was it for Noah to undertake &s;uch a work, which kept him and &s;o many others bu&s;ily employed for &s;o long a time! For be|&s;ide the continual care and labour, it was a work of va&s;t expence. It is not probable that any of that wicked generation would put to a finger to help for|ward &s;uch a work, which doubtle&s;s they believed was merely the fruit of Noah's folly, without full wages. Noah mu&s;t needs have been very rich, to be able to bear the expence of &s;uch a work, and to pay &s;o many workmen for &s;o long a time. It would have been a very great expence for a prince; and doubtle&s;s Noah was very rich, as Abraham and Job were afterwards. But it is probable that Noah &s;pent all his worldly &s;ub&s;tance in this work, thus mani|fe&s;ting his faith in the word of GOD, by &s;elling all he had; as believing there would &s;urely come a flood, which would de&s;troy all; &s;o that if he &s;hould keep what he had, it would be of no &s;ervice to him. Here|in he has &s;et us an example, &s;hewing us how we ought to &s;ell all for our &s;alvation.</P>
<P>NOAH'S undertaking was an undertaking of great difficulty, as it expo&s;ed him to the continual re|proaches of all his neighbours, for that whole one hundred and twenty years. None of them believed what he told them of a flood which was about to drown the world, as this was a thing the like of which had never been from the begining of the world to that time. For a man to undertake &s;uch a va&s;t piece of work, under a notion that it &s;hould be the means of &s;aving him, when the world &s;hould be de|&s;troyed, it made him the continual laughing &s;tock of the world. When he was about to hire workmen, doubtle&s;s all laughed at him, and we may &s;uppo&s;e that though the workmen con&s;ented to work for wa|ges,
<PB N="11" REF="016767_0009_0F9E1EE138BE17B0">
yet they laughed at the folly of him who em|ployed them. When the ark was begun, we may &s;uppo&s;e that every one that pa&s;&s;ed by and &s;aw &s;uch an huge hulk &s;tand there, laughed at it, calling it <HI>Noah's folly.</HI></P>
<P>IN the&s;e days men are with difficulty brought to do or &s;ubmit to that which makes them the objects of the reproach of all their neighbours. Indeed if while &s;ome reproach them, others &s;tand by them and honour them, this will &s;upport them. But it is very diffi|cult for a man to go on in a way, wherein he makes him&s;elf the laughing &s;tock of the whole world, and wherein he can find none who do not de&s;pi&s;e him. Where is the man that can &s;tand the &s;ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">k of &s;uch a trial for twenty years? Much more may I a&s;k, where &s;hall he be found, who will &s;tand it for one hundred and twenty years?</P>
<P>BUT in &s;uch an undertaking as this Noah at the divine direction engaged, and went through it, that him&s;elf and his family might be &s;aved from that common de&s;truction, which was &s;hortly about to come on the world He began, and al&s;o made an end&punc; According to all that GOD commanded him, &s;o did he. Length of time did not weary him: He did not grow weary of his va&s;t expence. He &s;tood the &s;hock of the deri&s;ion of all his neighbours, and of all the world, year after year: He did not grow weary of being their laughing &s;tock, &s;o as to give over his enterprize; but per&s;evered in it, till the ark was fini&s;hed. After this, he was at the trouble and charge of procuring &s;tores for the maintenance of his family, and of all the various kinds of creatures for &s;o long a time. Such an undertaking he engag|ed in and went through in order to a <HI>temporal</HI> &s;alva|tion. How great an undertaking then &s;hould men
<PB N="12" REF="016767_0010_0F9E1EE25C17D560">
be willing to engage in and go through in order to their <HI>eternal</HI> &s;alvation! A &s;alvation from an eternal deluge; from being overwhelmed with the billows of GOD'S wrath, of which Noah's flood was but a &s;hadow.</P>
<P>BUT I &s;hall particularly handle this doctrine under the three following propo&s;itions.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. THERE is a work or bu&s;ine&s;s, which mu&s;t be undertaken and accompli&s;hed by men, if they would be &s;aved.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. THIS bu&s;ine&s;s is a great undertaking.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. MEN &s;hould be willing to enter upon and go through this undertaking; though it be great, &s;eeing it is for their own &s;alvation.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>I. PROP. There is a work or bu&s;ine&s;s, which men mu&s;t enter upon and accompli&s;h, in order to their &s;alvation.&mdash;Men have no rea&s;on to expect to be &s;aved in idlene&s;s, or to go to heaven in a way of doing nothing. No; in order to it, there is a great work, which mu&s;t not only be begun, but mu&s;t be fini&s;hed.</P>
<P>I SHALL &s;peak upon this propo&s;ition, in an&s;wer to two enquiries.</P>
<P>ENQ. I. What is this work o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> bu&s;ine&s;s, which mu&s;t be undertaken and accompli&s;hed in order to the &s;alvation of men?</P>
<P>ANS. It is the work of &s;eeking &s;alvation in a way of a thorough and con&s;tant ob&s;ervance of all the du|ty, to which GOD directs us in his word. If we would be &s;aved, we mu&s;t &s;eek &s;alvation. For al|though men do not obtain heaven of them&s;elves, yet they do not go thither accidentally, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> without any in|tention
<PB N="13" REF="016767_0011_0F9E1EE322432610">
or endeavours of their own. GOD in his word hath directed men to &s;eek their &s;alvation as they would hope to obtain it. There is a race that is &s;et before them, which they mu&s;t run, and in that race come off victors, in order to their winning the prize.</P>
<P>THE &s;criptures have told us what particular duties mu&s;t be performed by us, in order to our &s;alvation. It is not &s;ufficient that men &s;eek their &s;alvation only in the ob&s;ervance of &s;ome of tho&s;e duties; but they mu&s;t be ob&s;erved univer&s;ally. The work we have to do, is not an obedience only to &s;ome, but to all the commands of GOD; a compliance with every in&s;ti|tution of wor&s;hip; a diligent u&s;e of all the appointed means of grace; a doing of all duty towards GOD and towards man.&mdash;It is not &s;ufficient that men have &s;ome re&s;pect to all the commands of GOD, and that they may be &s;aid to &s;eek their &s;alvation in &s;ome &s;ort of ob&s;ervance of all the commands; but they mu&s;t be <HI>devoted</HI> to it. They mu&s;t not make this a bu&s;ine&s;s by the <HI>by,</HI> or a thing in which they are neg|ligent and carele&s;s, or which they do with a &s;lack hand; but it mu&s;t be their great bu&s;ine&s;s, being at|tended to as their great concern. They mu&s;t not on|ly &s;eek, but &s;trive; they mu&s;t do what their hand findeth to do with their might, as men thoroughly engaged in their minds, and influenced and &s;et for|ward by great de&s;ire and &s;trong re&s;olution. They mu&s;t act as tho&s;e that &s;ee &s;o much of the importance of the things of religion above all other things, that every thing el&s;e mu&s;t be as an occa&s;ional affair, and nothing mu&s;t &s;tand in competition with the duties of religion. This mu&s;t be the one thing they do; Phil. iii. 13. This one thing I do.&mdash;It mu&s;t be the bu&s;ine&s;s to which they are given up, which they follow daily as their great work, to which they make
<PB N="14" REF="016767_0012_0F9E1EE3E8EF9188">
all other affairs give place, and to which they are ready to make other things a &s;acrifice. They mu&s;t be ready to part with plea&s;ures, and honor, and e&s;tate, and life, and to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ell all that they may &s;ucce&s;sfully ac|compli&s;h this bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>IT is required of every man, that he not only do &s;omething in this bu&s;ine&s;s, but that he &s;hould <HI>devote</HI> him&s;elf to it, which imples that he &s;hould give up him&s;elf to it, give up all his affairs, and all his tem|poral enjoyments. This is the import of taking up the cro&s;s, of taking CHRIST'S yoke upon us, and of denying our&s;elves to follow CHRIST. The rich young man, who came kneeling to CHRIST, to know what he &s;hould do to be &s;aved (Mark x. 17.) in &s;ome &s;en&s;e &s;ought &s;alvation, but did not obtain it. He in &s;ome &s;en&s;e kept all the commands from his youth up; but he was not cordially devoted to this bu&s;i|ne&s;s. He had not made a &s;acrifice to it of all his enjoyments, as appeared when CHRIST came to try him; he would not part with his e&s;tate for him.</P>
<P>IT is not only nece&s;&s;ary that men &s;hould &s;eem to be very much engaged, and appear as if they were devoted to their duty for a little while; but there mu&s;t be a <HI>con&s;tant</HI> devotedne&s;s; they mu&s;t be devot|ed to this work in a per&s;evering way, as Noah was to the bu&s;ine&s;s of building the ark, going on with that great, difficult, and expen&s;ive affair, and hold|ing out through the one hundred and twenty years, till it was fini&s;hed, and till the flood came.&mdash;Men mu&s;t not only be diligent in the u&s;e of the means of grace, and be anxiou&s;ly engaged to e&s;cape eternal ruin, till they obtain hope and comfort; but after|wards they mu&s;t per&s;evere in the duties of religion, till the flood come, the flood of death.&mdash;Not only mu&s;t the faculties, &s;trength, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of men
<PB N="15" REF="016767_0013_0F9E1EE4DC16CBC0">
be devoted to this work; but al&s;o their time and their lives: They mu&s;t give up their whole lives to it, even to the very day when GOD cau&s;es it to rain on the earth, and the &s;torms and floods come. This is the work or bu&s;ine&s;s, which men have to do, in order to their &s;alvation.</P>
<P>ENQ. 2. Why is it needful that men &s;hould un|dertake to go through &s;uch a work in order to their &s;alvation?</P>
<P>ANS. I. Negatively; not to merit &s;alvation, or to recommend them to the &s;aving mercy of GOD. Men are not &s;aved on the account of any work of theirs, and yet they are not &s;aved without works. If we merely con&s;ider what it is for which, or on the ac|count of which men are &s;aved, no work at all in men is nece&s;&s;ary to their &s;alvation. In this re&s;pect they are &s;aved wholly without any work of theirs. Tit. iii. 5. Not by works of righteou&s;ne&s;s, which we have done, but according to his mercy he &s;aved us, by the wa&s;hing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Gho&s;t.</P>
<P>IF we enquire what we mu&s;t be &s;aved on the ac|count of, the an&s;wer is on the account of works: but not our own works, not on the account of any works which we have done or can do; but on the account of the works which CHRIST hath done for us. Works are the fixed price of eternal life, fixed in the beginning when GOD made man. And GOD hath never altered that price: it is fixed by an eter|nal, unalterable rule of righteou&s;ne&s;s. But &s;ince the fall there is no hope of our doing the&s;e works. As to us &s;alvation is offered freely without money and without price.

2. AFFIRMATIVELY; this is the way to &s;alvation which GOD hath appointed. Though it be not needful that we do any thing to merit &s;alvation, which CHRIST hath fully merited for all who believe in him; or that we &s;hould do any thing, for which, or on the account of the goodne&s;s of which we may be &s;aved; yet GOD for wi&s;e and holy ends hath ap|pointed, that we &s;hould come to &s;alvation in no other way, but that of good works done by us.</P>
<P>GOD did not &s;ave Noah on account of the labour and expence he was at in building the ark. Noah's &s;alvation from the flood was an in&s;tance of the free and di&s;tingui&s;hing mercy of GOD. Nor did GOD &s;tand in need of Noah's care, or co&s;t, or labour to build an ark. The &s;ame power, which created the world, and which brought the flood o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> waters upon the earth, could have made the ark <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> an in&s;tant, without any care or co&s;t of Noah, or any of the la|bour of tho&s;e many workmen, who were employed for &s;o long a time. Yet GOD was plea&s;ed to appoint, that Noah &s;hould be &s;aved in this way.&mdash;So GOD hath appointed that man &s;hould not be &s;aved, with|ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> his undertaking and doing this work, of which I have been &s;peaking; and therefore we are command|ed <HI>to work out our own &s;alvation with fear and trembling,</HI> Philip. ii. 12.</P>
<P>THERE are many wi&s;e ends to be an&s;wered by the e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;uch a work or bu&s;ine&s;s as pre-re|qui&s;ite to &s;alvation.&mdash;The glory of GOD required it. For although GOD &s;tands in no need of any thing that men do, to recommend them to his &s;aving mercy; yet it would reflect much on the glory of GOD'S wi&s;dom and holine&s;s, to be&s;tow &s;alvation on men in &s;uch a way as tends to encourage them in &s;loth and wickedne&s;s; or in any other way than that
<PB N="17" REF="016767_0015_0F9E1EE6282538C0">
which tends to promote diligence and holine&s;s. Man was made capable of action, with many powers of both body and mind fitting him for it. He was made for bu&s;ine&s;s and not idlene&s;s: and the main bu&s;ine&s;s for which he was made, was the bu&s;ine&s;s of religion. Therefore it becometh the wi&s;dom of GOD to be&s;tow &s;alvation and happine&s;s on men, in &s;uch a way as tends mo&s;t to promote his an&s;wering his end in this re&s;pect, and to &s;tir him up to a diligent u&s;e of his faculties and talents.</P>
<P>IT becometh the wi&s;dom of GOD &s;o to order it, that things of great value and importance &s;hould not be obtained without great labour and diligence. GOD hath wi&s;ely &s;o ordered in other things. So much as human learning and great moral accompli&s;hments are not to be obtained, without much care and la|bour. It is wi&s;ely &s;o ordered to maintain in man a due &s;en&s;e of the value of tho&s;e things which are ex|cellent. If great things were in common ea&s;ily to be obtained, it would have a tendency to cau&s;e men to &s;light and undervalue them. Men commonly de&s;|pi&s;e tho&s;e things, which are cheap, and which are ob|tained without difficulty.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH the work which hath been &s;poken of, performed by men, be not nece&s;&s;ary in order to me|rit &s;alvation; yet it is nece&s;&s;ary in order to their be|ing prepared for it. This is one rea&s;on why GOD appointed it as ab&s;olutely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in order to it. Men cannot be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> &s;alvation, without &s;eek|ing it in &s;uch a way <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> hath been de&s;cribed. This is nece&s;&s;ary in order that they have a proper &s;en&s;e of their own nece&s;&s;ities, and unworthine&s;s; and in order that they be prepared and di&s;po&s;ed to prize &s;alvation, when be&s;towed, and that they be properly thankful to GOD for it. The requi&s;ition of &s;o great a work in
<PB N="18" REF="016767_0016_0F9E1EE7526169F0">
order to our &s;alvation is no way incon&s;i&s;tent with the freedom of the offer of &s;alvation; as after all, it is both offered and be&s;towed without any re&s;pect to our work, as the price or meritorious cau&s;e of our &s;alvati|on, as I have already explained. Be&s;ides, &s;alvation be&s;towed in this way is better for us, more for our advantage and happine&s;s, both in this and the future world, than if it were given without this requi&s;ition.</P>
<P>II. PROP. This work or bu&s;ine&s;s, which mu&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e done in order to the &s;alvation of men, is a great undertaking. It often appears &s;o to men upon whom it is urged. Utterly to break off from all their &s;ins, and to give up them&s;elves for ever to the bu&s;ine&s;s of religion, without making a re&s;erve of any one lu&s;t, &s;ubmitting to and complying with every command of GOD, in all ca&s;es, and per&s;evering therein; appears to many &s;o great a thing, that they are in vain urged to undertake it. In &s;o doing it &s;eems to them, that they &s;hould give up them&s;elves to a perpetual bon|dage and eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> throw them&s;elves away. The greater part of men therefore choo&s;e to put it off, and keep it at as great a di&s;tance as they can. They cannot bear to think of entering immediately on &s;uch an hard &s;ervice, and rather than do it, they will run the ri&s;k of eternal damnation, by putting it off to an un|certain future opportunity.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH the bu&s;ine&s;s of religion is far from really being as it appears to &s;uch men; for the devil will be &s;ure, if he can, to repre&s;ent it in fal&s;e colours to &s;inners, and make it appear as black and terrible as he can; yet it is indeed a great bu&s;ine&s;s, a great undertaking; and it is fit that all, who are urged to it, &s;hould count the co&s;t beforehand and be &s;en&s;ible of the difficulty attending it. For though the devil di&s;courages many from this undertaking, by repre|&s;enting
<PB N="19" REF="016767_0017_0F9E1EE7BB6D16C8">
it to be more difficult than it really is; yet with others he takes a contrary cour&s;e, and flatters them it is a very ea&s;y thing, a trivial bu&s;ine&s;s, which may be done at any time, when they plea&s;e; and &s;o emboldens them to defer it from that con&s;ideration. But let none imagine any other or conceive any other notion of that bu&s;ine&s;s of religion, which is ab&s;olute|ly nece&s;&s;ary to their &s;alvation, than that it is a great undertaking. It is &s;o in the following accounts.</P>
<P N="1">1. IT is a bu&s;ine&s;s of great labour and care. There are many commands to be obeyed, many duties to be done, duties to GOD, duties to our neighbour, and duties to our&s;elves. There is much oppo&s;ition in the way of the&s;e duties from <HI>without.</HI> There is a &s;ubtil and powerful adver&s;ary laying all manner of blocks in the way. There are innumerable temptations of &s;atan to be re&s;i&s;ted and repelled. There is great oppo&s;iti|on from the world; innumerable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> laid on eve|ry &s;ide; many rocks and mountains to be pa&s;&s;ed over, many &s;treams to be pa&s;&s;ed through, and many flat|teries and enticements from a vain world to be re&s;i&s;t|ed. There is great oppo&s;ition from <HI>within;</HI> a dull and &s;luggi&s;h heart, which is exceeding aver&s;e from that activity in religion, which is nece&s;&s;ary; a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> heart, which is aver&s;e from religion and &s;piritual ex|erci&s;es, and continually drawing the contrary way; and a proud and a deceitful heart, in which corrupti|on will be exerting it&s;elf in all manner of ways. So that nothing can be done to any effect without a mo&s;t &s;trict and careful watch, great labour and &s;trife.</P>
<P N="2">2. IT is a con&s;tant bu&s;ine&s;s.&mdash;In that bu&s;ine&s;s which requires great labour, men love now and then to have a &s;pace of relaxation, that they may re&s;t from their extraordinary labour. But this is a bu&s;ine&s;s which mu&s;t be followed every day. Luke ix. 23.
<PB N="20" REF="016767_0018_0F9E1EE8D0A61D90">
If any man will come after me, let him deny him&s;elf, and take up his cro&s;s <HI>daily,</HI> and follow me. We mu&s;t ne|ver give our&s;elves any relaxation from this bu&s;ine&s;s; it mu&s;t be continually pro&s;ecuted day after day. If &s;ometimes we make a great &s;tir and bu&s;tle concerning religion, but then lay all a&s;ide to take our ca&s;e, and do &s;o from time to time; it will be of no good effect: we had e'en as good do nothing at all. The bu&s;ine&s;s of religion &s;o followed is never like to come to any good i&s;&s;ue, nor is the work eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> like to be accompli&s;h|ed to any good purpo&s;e.</P>
<P N="3">3. IT is a great undertaking, as it is an under|taking o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> great expen&s;e.&mdash;We mu&s;t therein <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ell all: we mu&s;t follow this bu&s;ine&s;s, at the expen&s;e of all our unlawful plea&s;ures and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, at the expen&s;e of our carnal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, often at the expen&s;e of our &s;ub&s;tance, of our credit among men, the good will of our neigh|bours, at the expen&s;e of all our earthly friends, and even at the expen&s;e of life it&s;elf.&mdash;Herein it is like Noah's undertaking to build the ark, which as hath been &s;hown was a co&s;tly undertaking: it was expen|&s;ive to his reputation among men, expo&s;ing him to be the continual laughing &s;tock of all his neighbours and of the whole world: and it was expen&s;ive to his e&s;tate, and probably co&s;t him all that he had.</P>
<P N="4">4. SOMETIMES the fear, trouble and exerci&s;e of mind, which are undergone re&s;pecting this bu&s;ine&s;s, and the &s;alvation of the &s;oul, are great and long con|tinued, before any comfort is obtained. Sometimes per&s;ons in this &s;ituation labour long in the dark, and &s;ometimes, as it were, in the very fire, they having great di&s;tre&s;s of con&s;cience, great fears, and many perplexing temptations, before they obtain light and comfort to lighten their bu&s;ine&s;s, and make their care and labour more ea&s;y to them. They &s;ometimes earne&s;tly and for a long time &s;eek comfort, but find it not, becau&s;e
<PB N="21" REF="016767_0019_0F9E1EE93411E138">
they &s;eek it not in a right manner, nor in the right objects. GOD therefore hides his face. They cry, but GOD doth not an&s;wer their prayers. They &s;trive, but all &s;eems in vain. They &s;eem to them&s;elves not at all to get forward, or nearer to a deliverance from &s;in; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o go backward rather than forward. They &s;ee no glimmerings of light: things rather appear darker and darker. In&s;omuch that they are often ready to be di&s;couraged, and to &s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">k under the weight of their pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s, and under the pro&s;pect of future mi&s;ery. In this &s;ituation, and under the&s;e views, &s;ome are almo&s;t driven to de&s;pair.</P>
<P>MANY after they have obtained &s;ome &s;aving com|fort, are again involved in darkne&s;s and trouble. It is with them as it was with the chri&s;tian Hebrews, of whom we read Heb. x. 32. After ye were illumi|nated ye endured, a great fight of afflictions. Some through a melancholy habit and di&s;temper of body, together with &s;atan's temptations, &s;pend a great part of their lives in di&s;tre&s;s and darkne&s;s, even after they have had &s;ome &s;aving comfort.</P>
<P N="5">5. IT is a bu&s;ine&s;s, which by rea&s;on of the many difficulties, &s;nares and dangers that attend it, requires much in&s;truction con&s;ideration and coun&s;el. There is no bu&s;ine&s;s wherein men &s;tand in need of coun&s;el more than in this. It is a difficult undertaking, an hard matter to proceed aright in it. There are ten thou&s;and wrong ways, which men may take; there are many labyrinths wherein many poor &s;ouls are en|tangled and never find the way out; there are many rocks on which thou&s;ands of &s;ouls have &s;uffered &s;hip|wreck, for want of having &s;teered a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ight.</P>
<P>MEN of them&s;elves know not how to proceed in this bu&s;ine&s;s, any more than the children of I&s;rael in the wilderne&s;s know where to go without the gui|dance
<PB N="22" REF="016767_0020_0F9E1EEA4FB5ED48">
of the pillar of cloud and fire. There is great need that they &s;earch the &s;criptures and give diligent heed to the in&s;tructions and directions contained in them as to a light &s;hining in a dark place; and that they a&s;k coun&s;el of tho&s;e &s;killed in the&s;e matters. And there is no bu&s;ine&s;s in which men have &s;o much need of &s;eeking to GOD by prayer, for his coun&s;el, and that he would lead them in the right way and &s;how them the &s;trait gate. For &s;trait is the gate and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it. Yea there are none that find it without direction from heaven.</P>
<P>THE building of the ark was a work of great dif|ficulty on this account, that Noah's wi&s;dom was not &s;ufficient to direct him, how to make &s;uch a build|ing, as &s;hould be a &s;ufficient &s;ecurity again&s;t &s;uch a flood, and which &s;hould be a convenient dwelling place for him&s;elf, his family and all the various kinds of bea&s;ts and birds, and creeping things. Nor could he ever have known how to con&s;truct this building, had not GOD directed him.</P>
<P N="6">6. THIS bu&s;ine&s;s never ends till life ends. They that undertake this laborious, careful expen&s;ive, &s;elf denying bu&s;ine&s;s mu&s;t not expect to re&s;t from their labours, till death &s;hall have put an end to them. The long continuance of the work which Noah un|dertook was what e&s;pecially made it a great undertak|ing This al&s;o was what made the travel of the children of I&s;rael through the wilderne&s;s appear &s;o great to them, that it was continued for &s;o long a time. Their &s;pirits failed they were di&s;couraged, and had not an heart to go through with &s;o great an undertaking.</P>
<P>BUT &s;uch is this bu&s;ine&s;s that it runs parallel with life, whether it be longer or &s;horter. Although we
<PB N="23" REF="016767_0021_0F9E1EEAB34D2DC0">
&s;hould live to a great age, our race and warfare will not be fini&s;hed, till death &s;hall come. We mu&s;t not expect that an end will be put to our labour, and care, and &s;trife by any hope of a good e&s;tate, which we may obtain. Pa&s;t attainments, and pa&s;t &s;ucce&s;s will not excu&s;e us from what remains for the future, nor will they make future, con&s;tant labour and care not nece&s;&s;ary to our &s;alvation.</P>
<P>III. MEN &s;hould be willing to engage in and go through this bu&s;ine&s;s, however great and difficult it may &s;eem to them, &s;eeing it is for their own &s;alva|tion.&mdash;Becau&s;e,</P>
<P N="1">1. A DELUGE of wrath will &s;urely come. The inhabitants of the old world would not believe that there would come &s;uch a flood of waters upon the earth, as that of which Noah told them, though he told them often; neither would they take any care to avoid the de&s;truction. Yet &s;uch a deluge did come; nothing of all tho&s;e things, of which Noah had fore|warned them, failed.</P>
<P>So there will &s;urely come a more dreadful deluge of divine wrath on this wicked world. We are often forewarned of it in the &s;criptures, and the world is as the world was then, it doth not believe any &s;uch thing. Yet the threatening will as certainly be ac|compli&s;hed, as the threatening denounced again&s;t the old world. A day of wrath is coming; it will come at its appointed &s;ea&s;on; it will not tarry, it &s;hall not be delayed one moment beyond its appointed time.</P>
<P N="2">2. ALL &s;uch as do not &s;ea&s;onably undertake and go through that great work, which has been &s;poken of, will &s;urely be &s;wallowed up in this deluge. When the floods of wrath &s;hall come, they will uni|ver&s;ally overwhelm the wicked world: all &s;uch as &s;hall not have taken care to prepare an ark; will
<PB N="24" REF="016767_0022_0F9E1EEB847A4168">
&s;urely be &s;wallowed up in it: they will find no other way of e&s;cape. In vain &s;hall &s;alvation be expected from the hills and from the multitude of mountains. For the flood &s;hall be above the tops of all the moun|tains. If they &s;hall climb up the tops of the moun|tains, thence &s;hall they be brought down; for the waters will ri&s;e above their heads. Or if they &s;hall hide them&s;elves in the caves and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the mountains, there the waters of the flood will find them out, will come in upon them fill up tho&s;e caves, and there &s;hall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> mi&s;erably peri&s;h.</P>
<P>As tho&s;e of the old world that were not in the ark peri&s;hed, agreeably to Gen. vii. 21, 22, 23. So all who &s;hall not have &s;ecured to them&s;elves a place in the &s;piritual ark of the go&s;pel, &s;hall peri&s;h much more mi&s;erably than the old world.&mdash;Doubtle&s;s the in|habitants of the old world had many contrivances to &s;ave them&s;elves. Some we may &s;uppo&s;e a&s;cended to the tops of their hou&s;es, being driven <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ut of one &s;to|ry to another, till at la&s;t they peri&s;hed in the highe&s;t &s;tory. Others climed to the tops of high towers; who yet were wa&s;hed thence by the boi&s;terous waves of the ri&s;ing flood. Some climed to the tops of trees; others to the tops of mountains, and e&s;pecially of the highe&s;t mountains. But all was in vain; the flood &s;ooner or later &s;wallowed them a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">l up: only Noah and his family, who had taken care to prepare an ark, remained alive.</P>
<P>So it will doubtle&s;s be at the end of the world, when CHRIST &s;hall come to judge the world in righ|teou&s;ne&s;s. Some, when they &s;hall look up and &s;ee him coming in the clouds of heaven, &s;hall hide them|&s;elves in clo&s;ets, and &s;ecret places in their hou&s;es. Others flying to the caves and dens of the earth, &s;hall attempt to hide them&s;elves there. Others &s;hall call upon the rocks and mountains to fall on them,
<PB N="25" REF="016767_0023_0F9E1EEC36411960">
and cover them from the face of him that &s;itteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the lamb.&mdash;So it will be after the &s;entence is pronounced and wicked men &s;ee that terrible fire a coming, which is to burn this world for ever, and which will be a deluge of fire, and will burn the earth even to the bottoms of the mountains, and to its very centre, agreeably to Deut xxxii 22. For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and &s;hall burn unto the lowe&s;t hell, and &s;hall con&s;ume the earth with her increa&s;e, and &s;et on fire the foun|dations of the mountains. I &s;ay, when the wicked &s;hall, after the &s;entence, &s;ee this great fire coming and beginning to kindle, and to take hold of this earth; there will be many contrivances devi&s;ed by them to e&s;cape: &s;ome flying to caves and holes in the earth, &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">iding them&s;elves in one place, and &s;ome in another. But let them hide them&s;elves where they will, or let them do what they will, it will be utterly in vain. Every cave &s;hall burn as an oven, the rocks and mountains &s;hall melt with fervent heat; and if they could creep down to the very centre of the earth, &s;till the heat would follow them, and rage with as much vehemence there, as on the very &s;urface.</P>
<P>So when wicked men, who neglect their great work in their lifetime, who are not willing to go through the difficulty and labour of this work, draw near to death, they &s;ometimes do many things to e&s;|cape death, and put forth many endeavours to lengthen out their lives at lea&s;t a little longer. For this end they &s;end for phy&s;icians, and perhaps many are con&s;ulted, and their pre&s;criptions are punctually ob&s;erved. Be&s;ide the&s;e things, they al&s;o u&s;e many endeavours to &s;ave their &s;ouls from hell. They cry to GOD; they confe&s;s their pa&s;t &s;ins; they promi&s;e future reformation; and, O, what would they not
<PB N="26" REF="016767_0024_0F9E1EED061910D0">
give for &s;ome &s;mall addition to their lives, or &s;ome hope of future happine&s;s. But all proves in vain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; GOD hath numbered their days and fini&s;hed them; and as they have &s;inned away the day of grace, they mu&s;t even bear the con&s;equence, and for ever lie down in &s;orrow.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE de&s;truction, when it &s;hall come, will be infinitely terrible. The de&s;truction of the old world by the flood was terrible. But that eternal de&s;tructi|on, which is coming on the wicked is infinitely more terrible. That flood of waters was but an image of this awful flood of divine vengeance. When the wa|ters poured down out of heaven, more like &s;pouts or cataracts, or the waters pouring down the falls of a great river, than like rain; it was very terrifying. When the windows of heaven were opened and the waters were poured down in torrents or cataracts, what an awful appearance was there of the wrath of GOD. This however is but an image of that terrible out pouring of the wrath of GOD, which &s;hall be for|ever, yea forever and ever, on wicked men. And when the fountains of the great deep were broken up, and the waters bur&s;t forth out of the ground, as though they had i&s;&s;ued out of the womb, as it is ex|pre&s;&s;ed in Job xxxviii. 8. This was an image of the mighty breakings forth of GOD'S wrath, which &s;hall be, when the flood-gates of wrath &s;hall be drawn up. How may we &s;uppo&s;e that the wicked of the old world repented, that they had not hearkened to the warnings which Noah had given them, when they &s;aw the&s;e dreadful things, and &s;aw that they mu&s;t peri&s;h! How much more will you repent your re|fu&s;ing to hearken to the gracious warnings of the go&s;pel, when you &s;hall &s;ee the fire of GOD'S wrath again&s;t you, pouring down from heaven and bur&s;t|ing on all &s;ides out of the bowels of the earth!</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="27" REF="016767_0025_0F9E1EEDA3B8DDF0">
4. THOUGH the work which is nece&s;&s;ary in order to man's &s;alvation be a great work, yet it is not im|po&s;&s;ible. What was required of Noah, doubtle&s;s appeared a very great and difficult undertaking. Yet he undertook it with re&s;olution, and he was car|ried through it. So if we undertake this work with the &s;ame goodwill and re&s;olution, we &s;hall undoubt|edly be &s;ucce&s;sful. However difficult it be, yet multitudes have gone through it, and have obtained &s;alvation by the means. It is not a work beyond what we are capable of by the faculties of our nature, nor beyond the opportunities, which GOD giveth us. If men will but take warning and hearken to coun|&s;el, if they will but be &s;incere and in good earne&s;t, be &s;ea&s;onable in their work, take their opportunities, u&s;e their advantages, be &s;teadfa&s;t and not wavering; they &s;hall not fail.</P>

<P>THE u&s;e I would make of this doctrine is to ex|hort all to undertake and go through this great work, which they have to do in order to their &s;alvation, and this, let the work &s;eem ever &s;o great and diffi|cult. If your nature be aver&s;e to it, and there &s;eems to be very frightful things in the way, &s;o that your heart is ready to fail at the pro&s;pect; yet &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider what has been &s;aid, and act a wi&s;e part. Seeing it is for your&s;elves, for your own &s;alvation; &s;eeing it is for &s;o great a &s;alvation, for your deliver|ance from eternal de&s;truction; and &s;eeing it is of &s;uch ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity in order to your &s;alvation, that the deluge of divine wrath will come and there will b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> no e&s;caping it, without preparing an ark; is it not be&s;t for you to undertake the work, engage in

it with your might, and go through it, though this cannot be done without great labour, care, difficulty, and expen&s;e?</P>
<P>I WOULD by no means flatter you concerning this work, or go about to make you believe, that you &s;hall find an ea&s;y, light bu&s;ine&s;s of it: No, I would not have you expect any &s;uch thing. I would have you &s;it down and count the co&s;t; and if you cannot find it in your hearts, to engage in a great, hard, la|borious and expen&s;ive undertaking, and to per&s;evere in it to the end of life; pretend not to be religious. Indulge your&s;elves in your ea&s;e; follow your plea|&s;ures; eat, drink and be merry; e'en conclude to go to hell in that way, and never make any more pre|tences of &s;eeking your &s;alvation. Here con&s;ider &s;e|veral things in particular.</P>
<P N="1">1. HOW often you have been warned of the ap|proaching flood of GOD'S wrath. How frequently have you been told of hell, have heard the threaten|ings of the word of GOD &s;et before you, and have been warned to flee from the wrath to come. It is with you, as it was with the inhabitants of the old world. Noah warned them abundantly of the approaching flood, and cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">elled them to take care for their &s;afe|ty. 1 Pet. iii. 19. 20.&mdash;Noah warned them in words; and not only &s;o, he preached to them and warned them in his actions. His building the ark, which took him &s;o long a time, and in which he em|ployed &s;o many hands, was a &s;tanding warning to them. All the blows of the hammer and ax, during the progre&s;s of that building, were &s;o many calls and warnings to the old world, to take care for their pre|&s;ervation from the approaching de&s;truction. Every knock of the workmen was a knock of JESUS CHRIST at the door of their hearts. But they would not
<PB N="29" REF="016767_0027_0F9E1EEF23A48AD0">
hearken: all th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e warnings, though repeated every day and continued for &s;o long a time, availed nothing.</P>
<P>NOW is it not much &s;o with you, as it was with them? How often have you been warned? how have you heard <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he warning knocks of the go&s;pel, &s;abbath after &s;abbath for the&s;e many years? Yet how have &s;ome of you no more regarded them, than the inhabi|tants of the old world regarded the noi&s;e of the workmen's tools in Noah's ark!</P>
<P>OBJECTION. But here po&s;&s;ibly it may be objected by &s;ome, that though it be true, they have often been told of hell, yet they never &s;aw any thing of it, and therefore they cannot realize it, that there is any &s;uch place. They have often heard of hell, and are told that wicked men, when they die, go to a mo&s;t dread|ful place of torment<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">; that hereafter there will be a day of judgment, and that the world will be con&s;um|ed by fire. But how do they know that it is really &s;o? How do they know what becomes of the&s;e wicked men that die? None of them come back to tell them. They have nothing to depend on, but the word which they hear. And how do they know that all is not a cunningly devi&s;ed &s;able.</P>
<P>ANSW. The &s;inners of the old world had the ve|ry &s;ame objection again&s;t what Noah told them of a flood about to drown the world. Yet the bare word of GOD proved to be &s;ufficient evidence that &s;uch a thing was coming. What was the rea&s;on that none of the many millions then upon earth, believed what Noah &s;aid, but this, that it was a &s;trange thing, that no &s;uch thing had ever before been known? And what a &s;trange &s;tory mu&s;t that of Noah have appear|ed to them, wherein he told them of a deluge of wa|ters above the tops of the mountains! Therefore it is &s;aid Heb. xi. 7. That Noah was warned of GOD of
<PB N="30" REF="016767_0028_0F9E1EEFD9816758">
things not &s;een as yet. It is probable, none could conceive how it could be that the whole world &s;hould be drowned in a flood of waters; and all were ready to a&s;k, where there was water enough for it; and by what means it &s;hould be brought upon the earth. Noah did not tell them how it &s;hould be brought to pa&s;s: he only told them that GOD had &s;aid, that it &s;hould be: and that proved to be enough. The event &s;hewed their folly in not depending on the mere word of GOD, who was able, who kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">w how to bring it to pa&s;s, and who could not lie.</P>
<P>IN like manner the word of GOD will prove true in threatning a flood of eternal wrath, to overwhelm all the wicked. You will believe it, when the event &s;hall prove it, when it &s;hall be too late to profit by the belief. The word of GOD will never fail; no|thing is &s;o &s;ure as that; heaven and earth &s;hall pa&s;s away, but the word of GOD &s;hall not pa&s;s away. It is firmer than mountains of bra&s;s. At the end the vi&s;ion will &s;peak and not lie. <Q>The decree &s;hall bring forth,</Q> and all wicked men &s;hall know that GOD is the LORD, that he is a GOD of truth, and that they are fools who will not depend on his word. The wicked of the old world counted Noah a fool for depending &s;o much on the word of GOD, as to put him&s;elf to all the fatigue and expen&s;e of building the ark; but the event &s;howed that they them&s;elves were the fools, and that he was wi&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. CONSIDER that the &s;pirit of GOD will not al|ways &s;trive with you; nor will his long &s;uffering al|ways wait upon you. SO GOD &s;aid concerning the inhabitants of the old world; Gen. vi. 3. My &s;pirit &s;hall not always &s;trive with man, for that he al&s;o is fle&s;h; yet his days &s;hall be one hundred and twenty years. All this while GOD was &s;triving with them.
<PB N="31" REF="016767_0029_0F9E1EF305867590">
It was a day of grace with them, and GOD'S long &s;uf|fering, all this while, waited upon them; as appears by 1 Pet. iii. 20. Which &s;ome time were di&s;obedient, when once the long &s;uffering of GOD waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing. All this while they had an opportunity to e&s;cape, if they would but hearken and believe GOD.</P>
<P>EVEN after the ark was fini&s;hed, which &s;eems to have been but little before the flood came, &s;till there was an opportunity; the door of the ark &s;tood open for &s;ome time. After the ark was fini&s;hed there was &s;ometime, during which Noah was employed in lay|ing up &s;tores in the ark Even then it was not too late; the door of the ark yet &s;tood open.&mdash;About a week before the flood came, Noah was commanded to begin to gather in the bea&s;ts and birds. During this la&s;t week &s;till the door of the ark &s;tood open.&mdash;But on the very day that the flood began to come, while the rain was yet withheld, Noah and his wife, his three &s;ons and their wives, went into the ark, and we are told, Gen. vii. 16. That GOD &s;hut him in. Then the day of GOD'S patience was pa&s;t; the door of the ark was &s;hut; GOD him&s;elf, who &s;huts and no man opens, &s;hut the door. Then all hope of their e&s;caping the flood was pa&s;t. Then, after that, it was too late to repent that they had not hearkened to Noah's warnings, and had not entered into the ark, while the door &s;tood open.</P>
<P>AFTER Noah and his family had entered into the ark, and GOD had &s;hut them in, after the windows of heaven were opened, and they &s;aw how the waters were poured down out of heaven, we may &s;uppo&s;e that then many of tho&s;e who were near, come running to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the ark, knocking at the door, and crying mo&s;t piteou&s;ly for entrance. But it was too
<PB N="32" REF="016767_0030_0F9E1EF51CB87290">
late; GOD him&s;elf had &s;hut the door, and Noah had no licence, and probably no power, to open it. We may &s;uppo&s;e, they &s;tood knocking and calling <HI>Open to us, Open to us; O let us in; we beg that we may be let in.</HI> And probably &s;ome of them pleaded old acquaintance with Noah; that they had always been his neighbours, and had even helped him to build the ark. But all was in vain. There they flood, till the waters of the flood came, without mercy &s;wept them away from the door of the ark, and &s;wallowed them up.</P>
<P>So it will be with you, if you continue to refu&s;e to hearken to the warnings, which are given you. Now GOD is &s;triving with you. Now he is warning you of the approaching flood and calling upon you &s;ab|bath after &s;abbath. Now the door of the ark &s;tands open. But GOD'S &s;pirit will not always &s;trive with you: his long &s;uffering will not always wait upon you. There is an appointed day of GOD'S patience, which is as certainly limited, as it was to the old world. GOD hath &s;et your bounds which you cannot pa&s;s. Though n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">w warnings are continued in plenty, yet there will be <HI>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t</HI> knocks and <HI>la&s;t</HI> calls, the la&s;t that ever you &s;hall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ear When the appointed time &s;hall be elap&s;ed, GOD will &s;hut the door, and you &s;hall never &s;ee it open again; for GOD &s;hutteth and no man openeth.</P>
<P>IF you improve not your opportunity before that time, you will cry in vain, Lord, Lord, open to us. Mat. x. 11, 12. and Luke xiii. 25, &amp;c&mdash;While you &s;hall &s;tand at the door with your piteous cries, the flood of GOD'S wrath will come upon you, overwhelm you and you &s;hall not e&s;cape. The tempe&s;t &s;hall carry you away without mercy, and you &s;hall be for|ever &s;wallowed up and lo&s;t.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="33" REF="016767_0031_0F9E1EF62693DEA8">
3. CONSIDER how mighty the billows of divine wrath will be, when they &s;hall come. The waters of Noah's flood were very great. The deluge was va&s;t; it was very deep; the billows reached as it were to the very heavens, being fifteen cubits above the highe&s;t mountains; and it was an ocean which had no &s;hores; &s;ignifying the greatne&s;s of that wrath, which is coming on wicked men in another world, which will be like a mighty flood of waters, over|whelming them, and ri&s;ing va&s;tly high over their heads, with billows reaching to the very heavens. Tho&s;e billows will be bigger, and higher, and hea|vier than mountains on their poor &s;ouls. The wrath of GOD will be an ocean without &s;hores, as Noah's flood was: it will be mi&s;ery that will have no end.</P>
<P>THE mi&s;ery of the damned in hell can be better repre&s;ented by nothing, than by a deluge of mi&s;ery, a mighty deluge of wrath, which will be ten thou&s;and times wor&s;e than a deluge of waters; for it will be a deluge of liquid fire, as in the &s;criptures it is called a lake of fire and brim&s;tone.</P>
<P>AT the end of the world, all the wicked &s;hall liter|ally be &s;wallowed up in a va&s;t deluge of fire, which &s;hall be as great and as mighty, as Noah's deluge of water. See 2 Pet. iii. 5. 6. 7.&mdash;After that the wicked will have mighty billows of fire and brim|&s;tone eternally rolling over their poor &s;ouls, and their mi&s;erable, tormented bodies. Tho&s;e billows will be bigger than the mountains, or they may be called va&s;t liquid mountains of fire and brim&s;tone. And when one billow &s;hall have gone over their heads, another &s;hall follow, and &s;o one &s;hall follow another, without intermi&s;&s;ion, giving them no re&s;t day nor night to all eternity.</P>
<P N="4">4. THIS flood of wrath will probably come upon
<PB N="34" REF="016767_0032_0F9E1EF6A1185210">
you &s;uddenly, when you &s;hall think little of it, and it &s;hall &s;eem far from you. So the flood came upon the old world; &s;ee Mat. xxiv. 36. &amp;c.&mdash;Probably many of them were &s;urprized in the night by the wa|ters bu&s;ting &s;uddenly in at their doors, or under the foundations of their hou&s;es, coming in upon them in their beds. For when the fountains of the great deep were broken up, the waters, as was ob&s;erved before, bur&s;t forth in mighty torrents, as if they had i&s;&s;ued out of the womb. To &s;uch a &s;udden &s;urprize of the wicked of the old world in the night, proba|bly that alludes in Job xxvii. 20. <Q>Terrours take hold on him as waters; a tempe&s;t &s;tealeth him a|way in the night.</Q></P>
<P>So de&s;truction is wont to come on wicked men, who hear many warnings of approaching de&s;truction, and yet will not be influenced by them. For he that is often reproved, and hardeneth his neck, &s;hall &s;ud|denly be de&s;troyed and that without remedy. Prov. xxix. 1. And when they &s;hall &s;ay, peace and &s;afety; then &s;udden de&s;truction cometh upon them, as travel upon a woman with child, and they &s;hall not e&s;cape. 1. Thes. v. 3.</P>
<P N="5">5. IF you will not hearken to the many warn|ings, which are given you of approaching de&s;truction, you will be guilty of more than bruti&s;h madne&s;s: You will be more bruti&s;h than the brutes them&s;elves. The ox knoweth his owner and the a&s;s his ma&s;ter's crib. They know upon whom they are dependent, and whom they mu&s;t obey, and act accordingly. But you &s;o long as you neglect your own &s;alvation, act as if you knew not GOD, your creator and pro|prietor, nor your dependence upon him.&mdash;The very bea&s;ts, when they &s;ee &s;igns of an approaching &s;torm, will betake them&s;elves to their dens for &s;helter. Yet
<PB N="35" REF="016767_0033_0F9E1EF7641FC1C8">
you, when abundantly warned of the approaching &s;torm of divine vengeance will not fly to <HI>the hiding-place from the &s;torm and the covert from the tempe&s;t.</HI> The &s;parrow, the &s;wallow and other birds, when they are forewarned of approaching winter, will betake them|&s;elves to a &s;afer climate. Yet you who have been often forewarned of the piercing bla&s;ts of divine wrath, will not, in order to e&s;cape them, enter into the new Jeru&s;alem, of mo&s;t mild and &s;alubrious air, though the gate &s;tands wide open to receive you. The very ants will be diligent in &s;ummer to lay up for winter. Yet you will do nothing to lay up in &s;tore a good foundation again&s;t the time to come. Balaam's a&s;s would not run upon a drawn &s;word, though his ma&s;ter, for the &s;ake of gain, would ex|po&s;e him&s;elf to the &s;word of GOD'S wrath; and &s;o GOD made the dumb a&s;s, both in his words and actions, to rebuke the madne&s;s of the prophet. 2. Pet. ii. 16. In like manner you, although you have been often warned that the &s;word of GOD'S wrath is drawn again&s;t you, and will certainly be thru&s;t through you, if you proceed in your pre&s;ent cour&s;e, &s;till proceed regard|le&s;s of the con&s;equence.</P>
<P>SO GOD made the very bea&s;ts and birds of the old world to rebuke the madne&s;s of the men of that day. For they, even all &s;orts of them, fled to the ark, while the door was yet open; which the men of that day refu&s;ed to do; GOD hereby thus &s;ignifying, that their folly was greater, than that of the very brute creatures.</P>
<P>SUCH folly and madne&s;s are you guilty of, who refu&s;e to hearken to the warnings that are given you of the approaching flood of the wrath of GOD.</P>
<P>YOU have been once more warned to day, while the door of the ark yet &s;tands open. You have as it
<PB N="36" REF="016767_0034_0F9E1EF829CC7C38">
were once again heard the knocks of the hammer and ax in the building of the ark; to put you in mind, that a flood is approaching. Take heed, therefore that you do not &s;till &s;top your ears, treat the&s;e warnings with a regardle&s;s heart, and &s;till ne|glect the great work which you have to do, le&s;t the flood of wrath &s;uddenly come upon you, &s;weep you away and there be no remedy.</P>

<Q><HI>And</HI> ELIJAH <HI>came unto all the people and &s;aid, How long halt ye between two opinions? If the</HI> LORD <HI>be</HI> GOD, <HI>follow him; but if Baal, then follow him. And the people an&s;wered him not a word.</HI></Q>

<P>IT is the manner of GOD, before he be&s;tows any &s;ignal or remarkable mercy on a people, fir&s;t to prepare them for it; and before he removes any aw|ful judgments which he hath brought upon them for their &s;ins, fir&s;t to cau&s;e them to for&s;ake tho&s;e &s;ins which procured tho&s;e judgments. We have an in|&s;tance of this in the chapter wherein is the text.</P>
<P>IT was a time of &s;ore famine in I&s;rael. There had been neither rain nor dew, for the &s;pace of three years and &s;ix months. This famine was brought upon the land for their idolatry. But GOD was now about to remove this judgment; and therefore to prepare them for it, &s;ends Elijah to convince them of the folly of idolatry, and to bring them to repentance of it.&mdash;In
<PB N="38" REF="016767_0036_0F9E1EF9C644C450">
order to this, Elijah by the command of the LORD goes and &s;hows him&s;elf to Ahab, and directs him to &s;end and gather all I&s;rael to him at mount Car|mel, and all the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves, that eat at Je|zebel's table, four hundred; that they might deter|mine the matter and bring the controver&s;y to an i&s;&s;ue, whether Jehovah or Baal were GOD.&mdash;To this end, Elijah propo&s;es that each &s;hould take a bul|lock, that he &s;hould take one, and the prophets of Baal another, that each &s;hould cut his bullock in pie|ces, lay it on the wood, and put no fire under; and that the GOD who &s;hould an&s;wer by fire &s;hould be concluded to be GOD.</P>
<P>THE text contains an account of what Elijah &s;aid to all the people at their fir&s;t meeting and of their &s;i|lence <Q>;And Elijah came unto all the people and &s;aid, how long halt ye between two opinions? If the LORD be GOD, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him.</Q> To which the people, it &s;eems, made no reply. In the&s;e words, we may ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1">1. HOW Elijah expo&s;tulates with the people a|bout their halting &s;o long between two opinions; in which expo&s;tulation may be ob&s;erved,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) WHAT the two opinions were, between which they halted, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Whether the LORD were GOD, or whether Baal were GOD. The ca&s;e in I&s;rael &s;eems to have been this; there were &s;ome who were altoge|ther for Baal and wholly rejected the true GOD; of which number, to be &s;ure, were Jezebel and the pro|phets of Baal. And there were &s;ome among them, who were altogether for the GOD of I&s;rael and wholly rejected Baal; as GOD told Elijah that <Q>he had yet left in I&s;rael &s;even thou&s;and, that had not bowed the knee to Baal, and who&s;e mouths had not ki&s;&s;|ed him;</Q> 1 Kings xix. 18.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="016767_0037_0F9E1EFDD11B70B8">
BUT the re&s;t of the people halted between two opinions. They &s;aw that &s;ome were for one, and &s;ome for the other, and they did not know which to choo&s;e; and as is commonly the ca&s;e, when difference of opinions prevails, there were many who had no re|ligion at all; they were not &s;ettled in any thing; the different opinions prevalent in I&s;rael di&s;tracted and confounded them.&mdash;Many who profe&s;&s;ed to be|lieve in the true GOD, were yet very cold and indif|ferent, and many very wavering and un&s;ettled. They &s;aw that the king and queen were for Baal; and Baal's party was the prevailing party; but their fore|fathers had been for the LORD; and they knew not which were right. Thus they halted between two opinions.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) IN this expo&s;tulation is implied the unrea|&s;onablene&s;s of their thus halting between two opini|ons.&mdash;<Q>How long halt ye between two opini|ons? If the LORD be GOD, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him</Q>&mdash;Which implies that they ought to determine one way or the other.</P>
<P N="2">2. WE may ob&s;erve their &s;ilence on this occa&s;i|on;&mdash;"And the people an&s;wered him not a word" as being convicted in their own con&s;ciences of the unrea&s;onablene&s;s of their being for &s;o long a time wavering and unre&s;olved: they had nothing to reply in excu&s;e for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>DOCTRINE. The unre&s;olvedne&s;s of many per&s;ons in religion is very unrea&s;onable.</P>
<P>I. PROP. Many per&s;ons remain exceedingly unde|termined with re&s;pect to the things of religion. They are very much undetermined in them&s;elves whether to embrace religion or to reject it.&mdash;Many who are baptized and make a profe&s;&s;ion of religion, and &s;eem to be chri&s;tians; are yet in their own minds halt|ing
<PB N="40" REF="016767_0038_0F9E1EFFEFB6D800">
between two opinions: they never yet came ful|ly to a conclu&s;ion, whether to be chri&s;tians or not. They are tought the chri&s;tian religion in their child|hood, and have the bible, the word preached, and the means of grace all their days; yet continue, and grow up, and many grow old, in an unre&s;olvedne&s;s, whe|ther to embrace chri&s;tianity or not; and many con|tinue unre&s;olved as long as they live.</P>
<P N="1">1. THERE are &s;ome per&s;ons who have never come to a &s;ettled determination in their own minds, whe|ther or no there be any truth in religion. They hear of the things of religion from their childhood all their days; but never come to a conclu&s;ion in their own minds, whether they be real or fabulous. Par|ticularly, &s;ome have never come to any determinati|on in their own minds, whether there be any &s;uch thing as <HI>conver&s;ion.</HI> They hear much talk about it, and know that many pretend to be the &s;ubjects of it; but they are never re&s;olved whether all be not mere de&s;igned hypocri&s;y and impo&s;ture, or the mere notions of whim&s;ical per&s;ons.</P>
<P>SOME never come to any determination whether the &s;criptures be the word of GOD, or whether they be the invention of men; and whether the &s;tory concern|ing JESUS CHRIST be any thing but a fable. They fear it is true, but &s;ometimes very much doubt of it. Sometimes when they hear arguments for it, they give an a&s;&s;ent to it, that it is true; but upon every little objection or temptation ari&s;ing, they call it in que&s;tion; and are always wavering and never &s;ettled about it.</P>

<P N="2">2. THERE are &s;ome who never have come to any determination in their own minds, whether to em|brace religion in the practice of it. Religion con|&s;i&s;ts not merely, or chiefly in theory or &s;peculation, but in practice. It is a practical thing; the end of it is to guide and influence us in our practice: and con&s;idered in this view, there are multitudes who ne|ver have come to a conclu&s;ion whether to embrace religion or not.&mdash;It is probably pretty general for men to de&s;ign to be religious &s;ometime or other, be|fore they die: For none intend to go to hell. But they &s;till keep it at a di&s;tance; they put it off from time to time, and never come to any conclu&s;ion which determines them in their pre&s;ent practice. And &s;ome never &s;o much as fix upon any time. They de&s;ign to be religious &s;ometime before they die, but they know not when.</P>
<P>THERE are many who have always hitherto con|tinued unre&s;olved about the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;triving and being earne&s;tly engaged for &s;alvation. They flatter them&s;elves that they may obtain &s;alvation, though they be not &s;o earne&s;tly engaged; though they mind the world and their worldly affairs more than their &s;alvation. They are often told how nece&s;&s;ary it is that they make ha&s;te and not delay, that they do whatever their hand findeth to do with their might,
<PB N="42" REF="016767_0040_0F9E1F01F01D5E18">
that they be violent, that a dull, &s;lack way of &s;eeking &s;alvation is never like to be effectual. But of the&s;e things they are never thoroughly convinced. Some &s;eem to re&s;olve to be in earne&s;t, and &s;eem to &s;et out with &s;ome engagedne&s;s of mind; but &s;oon fail, be|cau&s;e they have never been fully convinced of the nece&s;&s;ity of it.</P>
<P>MANY have never come to a determination what to choo&s;e for their portion. There are but two things which GOD offers to mankind for their portion: One is this world, with the plea&s;ures and profits of &s;in, to|gether with eternal mi&s;ery en&s;uing: The other is heaven and eternal glory, with a life of &s;elf-denial and re&s;pect to all the commands of GOD, preceeding. Many as long as they live come to no &s;ettled deter|mination, which of the&s;e to choo&s;e. They mu&s;t have one or the other, they cannot have both. But they always remain in &s;u&s;pence, and never make their choice.</P>
<P>THEY would fain have heaven and this world too; they would have &s;alvation and the plea&s;ures and pro|fits of &s;in too. But con&s;idering heaven and the world, as GOD offers them, they will have neither. GOD offers heaven only with the &s;elf denial and difficulty which are in the way to it; and they are not willing to have heaven on the&s;e conditions. GOD offers the world, and the plea&s;ures of &s;in to men, not alone, but with eternal mi&s;ery in connection with them; and &s;o neither are they willing to have the world. They would fain divide heaven from the holine&s;s and &s;elf-denial which are the way to it, and from the holine&s;s which reigns in it, and then they would be glad to have heaven. They would fain divide &s;in from hell, and then they would fully determine, forever to cleave to &s;in.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="016767_0041_0F9E1F029C14B498">
BUT GOD will not make &s;uch a divi&s;ion for them. They mu&s;t have one or the other of the&s;e for their portion, as GOD offers; and therefore they never make any choice at all.&mdash;Indeed they do practically and in effect choo&s;e &s;in and hell. But they do not come to any re&s;olution in their <HI>own minds</HI> which they will have for their portion, whether heaven and ho|line&s;s, or the world and hell: they are always waver|ing and halting between two opinions. Sometimes they &s;eem to determine for the one and &s;ometimes for the other. In times wherein they meet with no dif|ficulty or temptation, and can as they &s;ay, do their duty without hurting them&s;elves or much cro&s;&s;ing their carnal inclinations, they &s;eem to choo&s;e heaven and holine&s;s. At other times wherein they meet with difficulty in the way of duty, and great temptations of worldly profits or plea&s;ures, are laid before them, then they choo&s;e the world and let heaven and holine&s;s alone.&mdash;There are among us va&s;t multitudes, be|fore whom the&s;e two things have been &s;et hundreds of times, who have never to this day come to a de|termination which to have.</P>
<P>So they have never yet determined which &s;hall be their ma&s;ter, whether GOD or mammon. There are but few who have undertaken the &s;ervice of GOD, and are come to a re&s;olution and preparedne&s;s of mind to &s;erve GOD and follow CHRIST, at all times, and to whatever difficulties it may expo&s;e them. Yet at the &s;ame time neither are they determined that they will continue to &s;erve &s;atan: they are afraid to draw up &s;uch a conclu&s;ion.&mdash;Thus many &s;pend away their lives without making their choice, putting that off, though they do in the mean time practically choo&s;e the &s;ervice of &s;atan. The&s;e are the per&s;ons of whom the apo&s;tle James &s;peaks in chap. i. 8. <Q>The dou|bleminded man is un&s;table in all his ways.</Q></P>

II. To continue thus undetermined and unre&s;ol|ved in the things of religion, is very unrea&s;onable, and that upon the following accounts.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE things of religion are things wherein we are to the highe&s;t degree intere&s;ted. The truth or fal&s;ehood of the doctrines of religion concerns us to the highe&s;t degree po&s;&s;ible. It is no matter of in|difference to us whether there be a GOD or not; or whether the &s;criptures be the word of GOD; or whe|ther CHRIST be the &s;on of GOD; or whether there be any &s;uch thing as conver&s;ion. It makes infinite odds to us, whether the&s;e things be &s;o or not. Therefore we are under the greate&s;t obligation in point of in|tere&s;t to re&s;olve in our minds whether they be true or fal&s;e. They who are undetermined whether there be any truth in religion, and are contented to be &s;o, not inquiring nor thoroughly u&s;eing the means to be determined; act very unrea&s;onably. They remain in doubt whether there be any &s;uch thing as an heaven or hell; are quiet and ea&s;y to continue ignorant in this matter; are not engaged in their minds to come to a determination; do not &s;earch and inquire what arguments there are to prove any &s;uch things; nor diligently weigh and con&s;ider the force of them; but bu&s;y their minds about other things of infinitely le&s;s importance; and act as if they thought it did not much concern them, whether there be a future and eternal &s;tate.</P>
<P>IF they think that there is not, yet it is a matter of &s;o great importance, that no wi&s;e man would re&s;t, until he had &s;atisfied him&s;elf; becau&s;e if there be &s;uch a future &s;tate as the &s;criptures tell us of, then we mu&s;t have our part in it, either in a &s;tate of eter|nal rewards, or in a &s;tate of eternal puni&s;hment.&mdash;So it is no matter of indifference to us what we
<PB N="45" REF="016767_0043_0F9E1F042A4B9748">
have for our portion, whether this world with hell, or a life of holine&s;s and &s;elf-denial with heaven. The&s;e oppo&s;ite portions relate not merely to a few days in this world, but they relate to eternity. It is infinite madne&s;s therefore not to come to a determination.</P>
<P>SO it is no matter of indifference what ma&s;ter we &s;erve, whether GOD or mammon; or what intere&s;t we will pur&s;ue, whether our temporal or eternal inter|e&s;t; or which we prefer, the commands of GOD or our plea&s;ures, our ea&s;e, and convenience. Doubt|le&s;s it will make a va&s;t odds one way or the other. We ought therefore to come to &s;ome determination, which we will choo&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. GOD hath made us rea&s;onable creatures and capable of rationally determining for our&s;elves. GOD hath made us capable of a good acquaintance with tho&s;e things, which do e&s;pecially concern our inter|e&s;t. Doubtle&s;s GOD hath made man capable of di&s;|covering the truth in matters of religion, of coming to a good determination in the&s;e que&s;tions, whether the &s;criptures be the word of GOD, whether there be a future &s;tate, and the like. The re&s;olution of the&s;e que&s;tions, which it &s;o much concerns us to determine, is not above our capacities. GOD hath not &s;et the&s;e things beyond the extent of our faculties.</P>
<P>SO GOD hath made us capable of making a wi&s;e choice for our&s;elves, as to the life which we &s;hall choo&s;e to lead. He hath given man &s;o much under|&s;tanding, as to make him capable of determining which is be&s;t, to lead a life of &s;elf-denial and enjoy eternal happine&s;s, or to take our &s;wing in &s;inful en|joyments and burn in hell for ever. The que&s;tion is of no difficult determination.&mdash;It is &s;o far from being a matter too hard for our rea&s;on, that the rea|&s;on of a child is &s;ufficient to determine this matter.
<PB N="46" REF="016767_0044_0F9E1F04DADCFFB8">
Therefore men in remaining undetermined in the&s;e matters, do not act as rea&s;onable creatures, but make them&s;elves like <Q>the hor&s;e and the mule, which have no under&s;tanding.</Q> P&s;al. xxxii. 9.</P>
<P N="3">3. GOD puts into our hands an happy opportu|nity to determine for our&s;elves. What better oppor|tunity can a man de&s;ire to con&s;ult his own intere&s;t, than to have liberty to choo&s;e his own portion? GOD &s;etteth life and death before us. Deut. xxx. 19. <Q>I call heaven and earth to record this day again&s;t you, that I have &s;et before you life and death, ble&s;&s;ing and cur&s;ing; therefore choo&s;e life, that thou and thy &s;eed after thee may live.</Q> See al&s;o Ezek. xviii. 31. 32. And chap. xxxiii. 11. What better opportunity can we de&s;ire for &s;ecuring to our|&s;elves the greate&s;t good, than to have eternal life, and unchangeable happine&s;s &s;et before us, and offered to our choice? Therefore tho&s;e who neglect coming to a re&s;olution, act unrea&s;onably, becau&s;e they &s;tand &s;o much in their own light and mi&s;s &s;o glorious an opportunity.</P>
<P N="4">4. THE things among which we are to make our choice are but few in number; there are but two portions &s;et before us, one of which mu&s;t be our por|tion; either life or death, either ble&s;&s;ing or cur&s;ing; either a life of univer&s;al and per&s;evering obedience with eternal glory, or a worldly, carnal, wicked life, with eternal mi&s;ery. If there were many terms in the offer made us, many things of nearly an equal value, one of which we mu&s;t choo&s;e, to remain long in &s;u&s;pence and undetermined would be more excu&s;a|ble; there would be more rea&s;on for long deliberati|on before we &s;hould fix. But there are but two terms, there are but two &s;tates in another world, in one or the other of which we mu&s;t be fixed to all eternity.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="016767_0045_0F9E1F0809FBADE8">
AND there are but two &s;tates in this world, a &s;tate of &s;in, and a &s;tate of holine&s;s, a natural &s;tate and a converted &s;tate. There is but one way in which we can come to life, which renders the determination of rea&s;on much the ea&s;ier. There are but two ma&s;ters to one of which we mu&s;t be reputed the &s;ervants, Baal and Jehovah, GOD and mammon: There are but two competitors for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of us, CHRIST and the devil.&mdash;There are but two paths, in one of which you are to travel, either in the &s;trait and narrow way which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">deth unto life, or the broad way which leade<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> unto de&s;truction.</P>
<P>THIS &s;hows the unrea&s;onablene&s;s of tho&s;e who live under light, and have the offers of the go&s;pel made to them, and yet remain from year to year unfixed and undetermined, halting between two opinions.</P>
<P N="5">5. GOD hath given us all needed helps to deter|mine us. We have all needed helps to determine our under&s;tandings, as to the truth of the things of religion, as whether there be a GOD, whether the &s;criptures be the word of GOD, whether there be a future &s;tate, &amp;c. We are not left in the dark as to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e things, as the poor heathen are, who are under great di&s;advantages to come to the knowledge of the truth, though they be not under an impo&s;&s;ibility, for <HI>they may haply feel after GOD and find him;</HI> Acts xvii. 27. But we have a clear &s;un&s;hine to guide us, we have a particular de&s;cription of tho&s;e things which are &s;et before us for truth, and have great opportunity to examine them. The &s;cripture lies open before us, and all the doctrines of the go&s;pel are particularly &s;et forth, with the rea&s;ons on which their evidence is founded. We may &s;earch and try their force and &s;ufficiency, as we will.</P>
<P>WE have great helps to a wi&s;e and rational deter|mination
<PB N="48" REF="016767_0046_0F9E1F0A1FC12E50">
in our choice; to determine whether it be be&s;t for us to choo&s;e a life of &s;in or a life of holine&s;s, the &s;ervice of GOD or the &s;ervice of Baal. We have very plainly &s;et before us the advantages of both &s;ides; the lo&s;s and gain are particularly &s;tated. CHRIST hath dealt by us faithfully, and hath told us what we &s;hall get, and what we &s;hall lo&s;e, by bring his followers. He hath al&s;o told us what we &s;hall get, and what we &s;hall lo&s;e by a life of &s;in. He hath not dealt by us deceitfully. He hath not pretended greater advantages in godline&s;s, than there really are, nor greater di&s;advantages or dangers in &s;in. Joh. xiv. 2. <Q>In my fathers hou&s;e are many man&s;ions. If it were not &s;o, I would have told you.</Q></P>
<P>HE hath told us plainly that we mu&s;t take up the cro&s;s daily and follow him; that we mu&s;t hate father and mother, and wife and children, and brethren and &s;i&s;ters, and our own life al&s;o, in order to become his di&s;ciples; and that we mu&s;t cut off our right hands, and pluck out our right eyes, in order to en|ter into heaven. Thus we have a fair opportunity to count the co&s;t on both &s;ides, and are directed &s;o to do. Luke xiv. 28.&mdash;How unrea&s;onable therefore is it, for men who have all the&s;e helps and advanta|ges, to remain in &s;u&s;pence, and to come<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> no conclu|&s;ion whether they will be chri&s;tians or heathens, whe|ther they will be for GOD or the devil; though they have lived under the preaching of the word, and of|fers of the go&s;pel, for many years.</P>
<P N="6">6. WE have no rea&s;on to expect to be under bet|ter advantages to determine hereafter, than we are now. We never &s;hall have a clearer revelation of go&s;pel truth; never &s;hall have the advantages and di&s;advantages of both &s;ides more plainly &s;et before us, than they are already in the word of GOD; nor are
<PB N="49" REF="016767_0047_0F9E1F0B5226F900">
we ever like to be under better advantages to know what will be be&s;t for us, and mo&s;t for our intere&s;t. Tho&s;e therefore who delay, gain nothing by their de|lays, but give &s;atan more opportunity to darken their minds, to deceive them, and lead them a&s;tray in their choice Therefore their delay of coming to a re&s;olu|tion is unrea&s;onable.</P>
<P N="7">7. IF they come not to a determination in this life, GOD will determine for them, and will appoint them their portion with the wicked. If &s;inners, by refu&s;ing to choo&s;e either life or death, either heaven or hell, could thereby avoid both, or if in this ca&s;e the matter would remain undetermined, till they &s;hould determine it; the folly and unrea&s;onablene&s;s of delaying a determination, would not be &s;o great. But that is not the ca&s;e; if they go on halting between two opinions, GOD will determine for them, and that quickly; he will determine where their portion &s;hall be, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> among the unbelievers, in the lake that bur|neth with fire and brim&s;tone forever. GOD will not wait upon them always, to &s;ee what they will choo&s;e; but he will put an i&s;&s;ue to the matter by his unaltera|ble &s;entence.&mdash;Therefore it becomes all, if they are afraid to have their lot a&s;&s;igned them in hell, to come &s;oon to a determination.</P>
<P N="8">8. DELAY in this ca&s;e is unrea&s;onable, becau&s;e tho&s;e who delay, know not how &s;oon the opportunity of choo&s;ing for them&s;elves will be pa&s;t. This oppor|tunity will la&s;t no longer than life; when once life is pa&s;t, they will no more have the offer made them; the &s;entence will be pa&s;t; the matter will be i&s;&s;ued.</P>
<P>THOSE who delay their choice in this world, will be glad to choo&s;e afterwards; then they will not be at all at a lo&s;s which to choo&s;e; they will be able ea|&s;ily to determine. The judgments of &s;inners, who
<PB N="50" REF="016767_0048_0F9E1F0B9EFE2C70">
are departed this life, are &s;oon re&s;olved whether there be any truth in religion or not; they can &s;oon deter|mine which is be&s;t and mo&s;t eligible, a life of obe|dience and &s;elf-denial, with heaven for a reward, or a life of irreligion and &s;in, with hell for a puni&s;hment. Now they no longer halt between two opinions; but it is too late, their opportunity is pa&s;t; they are rea|dy too late. They would give all the world for a|nother opportunity to choo&s;e; they would then &s;oon come to a determination. But it will not be granted them.</P>

<HEAD>APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P>I. LET this put every one upon <HI>examining</HI> him&s;elf, whether or no he have ever yet come to a full deter|mination in the affair of religion.</P>
<P>FIRST, inquire whether or no you have ever yet come to a full determination with re&s;pect to the <HI>truth</HI> of the things of religion. Have you ever been fully convinced? Is it a que&s;tion, which has been an&s;wered and determined with you, whether there be a future &s;tate; or does it yet remain a que&s;tion with you un|re&s;olved? Are you not yet to &s;eek whether there be any future &s;tate, and whether or no the &s;tory about JESUS CHRIST be any more than a fable? Here I de&s;ire you to note two things.</P>
<P N="1">1. IF the main rea&s;on why you a&s;&s;ent to the truth of religion be that others believe &s;o, and you have been &s;o in&s;tructed from your childhood; you are of tho&s;e with whom the truth of religion yet remains undetermined. Tradition and education will never fix and &s;ettle the mind, in a &s;atisfactory and effectual belief of the truth of religion. Though men, taking religion upon tru&s;t, may &s;eem to give a full a&s;&s;ent to the truth of religion, and not to call it in que&s;tion; yet &s;uch a faith will not &s;tand a &s;hock; a temptation
<PB N="51" REF="016767_0049_0F9E1F0C5F2E8B40">
ea&s;ily overthrows it: The rea&s;on of man in time of trial will not re&s;t on &s;o poor evidence as that.</P>
<P>THERE are multitudes who &s;eem to grant the truth of religion, with whom the main foundation of their faith is the tradition of their fathers, or the profe&s;&s;i|on of their neighbours; and it is to be feared, it is &s;o with many who count them&s;elves good chri&s;tians. But as to all &s;uch per&s;ons as never have &s;een any o|ther evidence to &s;atisfy them, either of the truth or fal&s;ehood of religion, they are they that halt between two opinions&mdash;The &s;ame may be &s;aid of tho&s;e who are un&s;table in their <HI>di&s;po&s;ition</HI> with regard to CHRIST or the things which he taught.</P>
<P N="2">2. IF you are fully come to a determination con|cerning the things of religion, that they are true, they will be of weight with you above all things in the world. If you be really convinced that the&s;e things are true, that they are no fable, but reality, it is im|po&s;&s;ible but that you be influenced by them above all things in the world; for the&s;e things are &s;o great, and &s;o infinitely exceed all temporal things, that it cannot be otherwi&s;e. He that really is convinced that there is a heaven and hell, and an eternal judgment; that the &s;oul as &s;oon as parted from the body, appears before the judgment &s;eat of GOD; and that the hap|pine&s;s and mi&s;ery of a future &s;tate is as great as the &s;cripture repre&s;ents it; or that GOD is as holy, ju&s;t and jealous, as he hath declared concerning him&s;elf in his word; I &s;ay, he that is really convinced and hath &s;ettled it with him&s;elf, that the&s;e things are cer|tainly true; will regard them and be influenced by them above all things in the world. He will be more concerned by far how he &s;hall e&s;cape eternal dam|nation, and have the favour of GOD and eternal life, than how he &s;hall get the world, gratify the fle&s;h,

plea&s;e his neighbours, get honour, or obtain any temporal advantage what&s;oever. His main inquiry will not be what &s;hall I eat, and what &s;hall I drink, &amp;c but he will &s;eek fir&s;t the kingdom of GOD and his righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>EXAMINE your&s;elves therefore by this: Are not your hearts chiefly &s;et upon the world and the things of it? Is it not more your concern, care and endea|vour to further your outward intere&s;t, then to &s;ecure an intere&s;t in heaven?

For let not that man think that he &s;hall receive any thing of the LORD. A double minded man is un&s;table in all his ways.</Q> If your determination were fixed in religion, you would be more &s;teady in your practice.</P>
<P N="4">4. IT is a &s;ign that you are halting between two opinions, if it be your manner, to balk your duty, whenever any notable difficulty comes in the way, con&s;iderably cro&s;s to your intere&s;t, or very incon&s;i&s;|tent with your ea&s;e or convenience, or your temporal honour. Whatever zeal you may &s;eem to have, whatever concern about the things of religion, and however &s;trict you be in ordinary; you have never, if this be your manner, come to a full determination; have never fully made choice of religion and the be|nefits of it, for your only portion; and at be&s;t have got no further than king Agrippa, who was <HI>almo&s;t</HI> per&s;uaded to be a chri&s;tian. Acts, xxvi. 28.&mdash;You are in the &s;tate of the &s;tony ground hearers, you have no root in your&s;elves, and like a tree without root, are ea&s;ily blown down by every wind.</P>
<P>II. I &s;hall conclude with an earne&s;t EXHORTATION to all, no longer to halt between two opinions, but immediately to come to a determination whether to be chri&s;tians or not. Let me in&s;i&s;t upon it, that you now make a choice, whether you will have heaven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> with a life of univer&s;al and per&s;evereing obedience for your portion; or hell, with a life &s;pent in the pur&s;uit of this world.&mdash;Con&s;ider tho&s;e things which have been &s;aid, &s;hewing the unrea&s;onablene&s;s

of continuing in &s;uch irre&s;olution about an affair of infinite importance to you, and as to which you have &s;o &s;hort an opportunity to make your choice. Con|&s;ider two things in addition to what hath been already &s;aid.</P>
<P N="1">1. THOSE who live under the go&s;pel, and thus continue undermined about religion, are more abo|minable to GOD than the heathen. GOD had rather that men &s;hould either be chri&s;tians, or down-right heathens. He hates tho&s;e per&s;ons who continue from year to year, under the calls, and warnings, and in|&s;tructions, and intreaties of GOD'S word; who yet can be brought to nothing; who will come to no de|termination at all; will neither be chri&s;tians, nor heathens. The&s;e are they who are &s;poken of in Rev. iii. 15. 16. <Q>I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot. So then becau&s;e thou art luke-warm, and neither cold nor hot, I will &s;pew the out of my mouth.</Q>&mdash;And Ezek. xx. 39. <Q>As for you, O hou&s;e of I&s;rael, thus faith the LORD GOD, Go ye, &s;erve ye every one his idols, and hereafter al&s;o, if ye will not hearken unto me: but pollute ye my holy name no more with your gifts, and with your idols.</Q>&mdash;The&s;e are they &s;poken of in 2 Tim. iii. 7. <Q>Ever learning and never coming to the knowledge of the truth.</Q></P>
<P N="2">2. IF you &s;till refu&s;e to come to a determination whether to be chri&s;tians or not; how ju&s;t will it be, if GOD &s;hall give you no further opportunity! If you refu&s;e to make any choice at all; and after all that hath been done to bring you to it, in &s;etting life and death &s;o often before you, in calling and warning you, if you will not come to a determination, how ju&s;t

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>ACTS, iv. 11.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>This is the &s;tone which was &s;et at nought of you builders.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN the foregoing chapters we have an account of the outpouring of the Holy Gho&s;t on the apo&s;tles at Penteco&s;t, and of the extraordinary effects of it in their &s;peaking boldly in the name of JESUS, and &s;peak|ing many &s;trange languages, and &s;o being made the in&s;truments of the &s;udden conver&s;ion of va&s;t multi|tudes. And in the chapter immediately preceding, there is an account how Peter and John miraculou&s;|ly healed a man, who had been a cripple from his birth; which together with the word which they &s;pake to the people that flocked together on the oc|ca&s;ion, was the means of a new acce&s;&s;ion to the church: &s;o that the number of them that heard the word and believed, as we are told in the fourth ver&s;e of this chapter, was about five thou&s;and.</P>
<P>THIS &s;udden and extraordinary progre&s;s of the go&s;|pel greatly alarmed the prie&s;ts and &s;cribes and other chief men among the Jews; &s;o that they laid hands

on Peter and John, and put them in hold, and the next day brought them fourth to appear before them, and called them to an account for what they had done. They a&s;ked them particularly by what pow|er, or by what name they had wrought the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> on the impotent man. Upon which Peter filled with the holy gho&s;t, makes an&s;wer, <Q>We rulers of the people and elders of I&s;rael&mdash;Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of I&s;rael, that by the name of JESUS CHRIST of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom GOD rai&s;ed from the dead, even by him doth this man &s;tand here before you whole. This is the &s;tone which was &s;et at nought by you builders, which is become the head of the corner.</Q> In the ver&s;e of the text the apo&s;tle mentions to them as now fulfilled, that in the 118th P&s;al. 22. ver&s;e. <Q>The &s;tone which the builders refu&s;ed is become the head &s;tone of the corner.</Q> This text in that p&s;alm, the apo&s;tle applies to them&punc;</P>
<P N="1">1. BY telling them, <HI>This is the &s;tone,</HI> i. e. this per|&s;on of whom he had &s;poken in the foregoing ver&s;e, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> JESUS CHRIST of Nazareth, whom they had crucified and whom GOD had rai&s;ed from the dead.</P>
<P N="2">2. BY telling them, that they were the builders &s;poken of. They before whom the apo&s;tle then was, and to whom he was &s;peaking, were rulers and elders and &s;cribes of the people, the high prie&s;t and other prie&s;ts. They as they were &s;et to be rulers and teachers among GOD'S people, by their office, were called to be builders of the church of GOD.</P>
<P N="3">3. BY telling them, that they had &s;et this &s;tone at nought. They had &s;o done by refu&s;ing to accept of him. CHRIST came to his own, and his own re|ceived him not: and not only &s;o, but they had open|ly manife&s;ted the greate&s;t contempt of him. They

<P N="4">4. BY telling him, that notwith&s;tanding this he was become the head of the corner. In &s;pite of all that they could do, he had obtained the chief place in the building. GOD had made him the main foun|dation of it, by rai&s;ing him from the dead, and &s;o putting great honour upon him, and by pouring out his &s;pirit and enduing his di&s;ciples with extraordina|ry gifts, and by &s;uddenly converting &s;o many thou|&s;ands to be the followers of CHRIST.&mdash;They put him to death that be might have no followers, concluding that that would utterly put an end to his intere&s;t in Judea. But they were greatly di&s;appointed: for the go&s;pel had incomparably greater &s;ucce&s;s after CHRIST'S death than before.

<P>UNBELIEVERS &s;et nothing by all the glory and excel|lency in CHRIST.</P>
<P N="1">1. THEY &s;et nothing by the excellency of his per&s;on.&mdash;CHRIST is a great and glorious per&s;on, a per&s;on of infinite worthine&s;s, on which account he is infinitely e&s;teemed and loved of the father, and is continually adored by the angels. But unbelie|vers have no e&s;teem at all of him on that account. They have no value at all of him on account of his being the Son of GOD. He is not &s;et the higher in
<PB N="60" REF="016767_0058_0F9E1F172E4598A8">
their e&s;teem on the accouut of his &s;tanding in &s;o near and honourable a relation to GOD the father. He is not valued at all the more for his being a divine per|&s;on, or one that is GOD. By his having the divine nature, he is infinitely exalted above all created beings. But he is not at all exalted by it in their e&s;teem. They &s;et nothing by his infinite maje&s;ty: his glori|ous brightne&s;s and greatne&s;s excite not any true re|&s;pect or reverence in them.</P>
<P>CHRIST is the holy one of GOD: he is &s;o holy that the heavens are not pure in his &s;ight. He is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all that holine&s;s which is the infinite beau|ty and loveline&s;s of the divine nature. But an un|believer &s;ets nothing by the holine&s;s of CHRIST.&mdash;CHRIST is the wi&s;dom of GOD and the power of GOD, as he is called 1. Cor. i. 24. But an unbeliever &s;ets nothing by his power and wi&s;dom.&mdash;The LORD JESUS CHRIST is full of grace and mercy: the mer|cy and love of GOD appear no where el&s;e &s;o brightly and gloriou&s;ly, as they do in the face of JESUS CHRIST. But an unbeliever &s;ets no value at all upon the infinite grace of CHRIST.</P>
<P>NEITHER do unbelievers &s;et any thing by tho&s;e ex|cellent virtues which appeared in CHRIST'S human nature, when he was upon earth. He was holy, harmle&s;s, undefiled and &s;eparate from &s;inners; he was meek and lowly of heart; he was patient under afflic|tions and injuries; when he was reviled, he reviled not again. But unbelievers &s;et nothing by the&s;e things in JESUS CHRIST.&mdash;They very often hear how ex|cellent and glorious a per&s;on CHRIST is: they are told of his holine&s;s, and grace, and conde&s;cen&s;ion, and meekne&s;s; and have the excellencies of CHRIST plainly &s;et forth to them; yet they &s;et all at nought.</P>
<P N="2">2. THEY &s;et nothing by his excellency in his work and office. They are told how glorious and com|plete
<PB N="61" REF="016767_0059_0F9E1F179D11DD30">
a mediator he is, how &s;ufficient to an&s;wer all our nece&s;&s;ities, and to &s;ave &s;inners to the uttermo&s;t; but they make light of it all; yea that make nothing of it&mdash;They hear of the wonderful wi&s;dom of GOD in contriving &s;uch a way of &s;alvation by CHRIST, they have the manifold wi&s;dom of GOD &s;et forth to them; but they &s;et nothing by this wi&s;dom, nor do they make any account of the excellency of this way of &s;alvation.</P>
<P>THE unbeliever hears what a wonderful thing it was, that he who was in the form of GOD and e&s;teem|ed it no robbery to be equal with GOD, &s;hould take upon him the human nature, and come and live in this world in a mean and low condition; but he makes nothing of this.&mdash;He hears much of the dying love of CHRIST to &s;inners, how wonderful it was that &s;o glorious a per&s;on, who is infinitely above the angels, &s;hould &s;o &s;et his love on &s;uch worms of the du&s;t, &s;o much below him, on &s;uch &s;inful creatures, who were his enemies, as to come and be made a cur&s;e for them, and die a cruel and ignominious death in their &s;tead; but he &s;ets nothing by all this. This dying love of CHRIST is a thing of no account with him, tho&s;e great things that CHRIST hath done and &s;uffered, are with him light matters, things of no weight at all.</P>
<P>UNBELIEVERS not only &s;et <HI>little</HI> by the glory and excellency of CHRIST, but they &s;et <HI>nothing</HI> by the&s;e things. Notwith&s;tanding all the &s;hows and pretences which many natural men make of re&s;pect to CHRIST, by &s;peaking honourably of CHRIST in their prayers, and in their common conver&s;ation, and by coming to &s;acraments and attending other ordinances of CHRIST; yet indeed they do not &s;et &s;o much by all the glory and excellency of CHRIST, either the glory of his per|&s;on, or the glory of his work as a Saviour, as they do by the &s;malle&s;t earthly enjoyment.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="016767_0060_0F9E1F18C757E9D0">
I PROCEED now to mention &s;ome EVIDENCES of the truth of this doctrine.</P>
<P N="1">1. THEY never give CHRIST any honor on the account of this his glory and excellency. They may and often do pay CHRIST an external and &s;eeming re&s;pect; but they do not honor CHRIST in their hearts. They have no exalting thoughts of CHRIST, no in|ward re&s;pect or reverence towards him: they have indeed no honorable, re&s;pectful thoughts of CHRIST. All their outward wor&s;hip is only feigned; none of it ari&s;es from any real honor or re&s;pect in their hearts towards Chri&s;t. It is either only for fa&s;hions &s;ake, and in compliance with cu&s;tom, or el&s;e it is forceed, and is what they are driven to by fear, as we read P&s;al. lxvi. 3. <Q>Through the greatne&s;s of thy power, &s;hall thine enemies &s;ubmit them&s;elves un|to thee.</Q> In the original it is, <HI>&s;hall thine enemies lie unto thee,</HI> i. e. yield a feigned obedience. Through the greatne&s;s of Chri&s;t's power, and for fear of his wrath, his enemies who have no re&s;pect or honour for him in their hearts, will lie to him, and make a &s;how of re&s;pect when they have none.</P>
<P>AN unbeliever is not &s;en&s;ible that Chri&s;t is wor|thy of any glory, and therefore does not at all &s;eek the glory of Chri&s;t in any thing that he does; he does nothing that he does in religion, out of re&s;pect to Chri&s;t's glory, but wholly for other ends; which &s;hows that he &s;ees not Chri&s;t to be worthy of any glory.&mdash;Chri&s;t is &s;et la&s;t and low|e&s;t in the heart of an unbeliever. He has high thoughts of other things; he has high thoughts of creature objects and earthly enjoyments, but mean and low thoughts of Chri&s;t. He has more honour|able thoughts of that which is but mere dirt and dung, than he has of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>THE unbeliver &s;hows the mean and contemptible
<PB N="63" REF="016767_0061_0F9E1F19E615CD38">
thoughts that he has of CHRIST, in refu&s;ing to accept of him, and in &s;hutting the door of his heart again&s;t him. CHRIST &s;tands at the door and knocks, and &s;ometimes &s;tands many years knocking at the door of his heart, and he refu&s;es to open to him. Now it certainly &s;hows that men have a very mean thought of a per&s;on, when they &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ut him out of their doors&mdash;Unbelievers &s;how the mean and di&s;honourable thoughts they have of CHRIST in that they dare not tru&s;t him. They believe not what he &s;ays to be true: they will not tru&s;t the word of CHRIST, &s;o far as the word of one of their hone&s;t neighbours, or of a &s;ervant whom they have found to be faithful.&mdash;It al&s;o appears that they have no real honour for CHRIST in their hearts, in that they refu&s;e to obey his commands. They do nothing that they do, from a &s;pirit of obedience to him: and that external obedi|ence which they render, is but a forced, feigned o|bedience, and not from any re&s;pect to CHRIST'S au|thority or worthine&s;s to be obeyed.</P>
<P N="2">2. THEY have no love to him on the account of his glory and excellency. If they did &s;et any thing by all the glory and excellency of CHRIST, or if they &s;aw any excellency or glory in CHRIST; they would have &s;ome mea&s;ure of love to CHRIST. But the truth is, they &s;ee no form or comline&s;s in CHRIST, and hence they have no love at all to CHRIST: an un|believer never exerci&s;es one act of true love to CHRIST. All that he is told of the glory of CHRIST, of his divine perfections, of his holine&s;s, his meekne&s;s and grace, has no influence at all to draw forth any love. The di&s;play of the&s;e things doth no more draw forth love out of the heart of an unbeliever, than it draws forth love from the &s;tones and rocks.</P>
<P>A NATURAL man hath no love of benevolence to|wards CHRIST. Notwith&s;tanding all that is declared
<PB N="64" REF="016767_0062_0F9E1F1A9941B2C0">
to him of the excellency of CHRIST, he has no good will towards CHRIST. He rejoices not in his glory and happine&s;s; he would not care what became of CHRIST, if he could but e&s;cape hell. If CHRIST &s;hould be dethroned, or made mi&s;erable, or &s;hould cea&s;e to be, he has not &s;o much good will to CHRIST, as would make him concerned about it. And if the kingdom and intere&s;t of CHRIST in the world, &s;hould go to ruin, it would be no wi&s;e grievous to the un|believer, provided his own intere&s;t could be &s;ecure.</P>
<P>SO al&s;o an unbeliever has no love of complacency in JESUS CHRIST for his excellency. He takes no delight in the view or con&s;ideration of any of that glory and excellency of CHRIST, of which he is told. He is told that it is exceedingly beautiful and glori|ous; but he &s;ees nothing entertaining in it; he takes no plea&s;ure in the view of any thing that he can &s;ee in CHRIST: the thoughts of the glory of CHRIST are no wi&s;e entertaining to him: he has no delight in the thoughts of it, or in any contemplations upon it.&mdash;He takes delight in thinking of the&s;e and tho&s;e earthly objects; but when he comes to turn his mind upon JESUS CHRIST, if ever he &s;o does, this is to him a dry and barren &s;ubject: he finds nothing there to feed and delight his &s;oul; no beauty or love|line&s;s to plea&s;e or gratify him.</P>
<P N="3">3. UNBELIEVERS have no de&s;ires after the enjoy|ment of CHRIST. If they did &s;et any thing by the glory and excellency of CHRIST, they would have &s;ome de|&s;ires after him on account of that excellency: e&s;peci|ally when he is offered to them, and is from time to time &s;et forth, as the proper object of their choice and de&s;ires. That which men prize, they are wont to de&s;ire, e&s;pecially if it be repre&s;ented to them as attain|able, and as fit and &s;uitable for them. But unbe|lievers have no de&s;ires after the enjoyment of CHRIST. They de&s;ire to be delivered from hell, but they de&s;ire</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="016767_0063_0F9E1F1CDA5E36B0">
THEY have no idea of any happine&s;s to be had in the enjoyment of CHRIST: they cannot conceive what happine&s;s there can be in beholding CHRIST and being with him, in &s;eeing his holine&s;s and con|templating his wonderful grace and divine glory. They have no reli&s;h for any &s;uch thing, nor appetite after it.</P>
<P N="4">4. THEY &s;how that they &s;et nothing by the glory and excellency of CHRIST, in that they &s;eek not at all a conformity to that glory and excellency. A na|tural man may &s;eek to be holy, but it is not for ho|line&s;s &s;ake, it is only that he may e&s;cape wrath. He has no de&s;ires after holine&s;s, nor is it indeed ho|line&s;s that he &s;eeks, becau&s;e he is all the while an enemy to holine&s;s. A natural man has no de&s;ires to have his &s;oul conformed to the glorious beauty and excellency of Chri&s;t, nor to have his image upon him.</P>
<P>IF he in any degree prized or delighted in the ex|cellencies of Chri&s;t, he would nece&s;&s;arily de&s;ire to be like him &s;o far as he could. This we &s;ee in our&s;elves and in all men, when we &s;ee any qualifications in o|thers, that are plea&s;ing to us and that we &s;et by, it is natural for us to endeavour to imitate them and to &s;eek to be in tho&s;e things conformed to tho&s;e per&s;ons. Hence men are apt to learn of tho&s;e, of whom they have a great e&s;teem: they naturally fall into an imi|tation of their ways and manner of behaviour. But natural men feel within them&s;elves no di&s;po&s;ition or inclination to learn of Chri&s;t, or to imitate him. Their tempers and di&s;po&s;itions remain quite contrary to Chri&s;t's, neither do they grow at all better or more conformed to Chri&s;t, but wax wor&s;e and wor&s;e. 2 Tim. iii. 13. <Q>Evil men and &s;educers &s;hall wax wor&s;e and wor&s;e.</Q></P>

<P>I. THIS doctrine may teach us the heinou&s;ne&s;s of the &s;in of unbelief, as this &s;in &s;ets all the glory and excellency of Chri&s;t at nought. It often appears &s;trange to natural men, that unbelief &s;hould be &s;po|ken of as &s;uch a heinous and crying &s;in. They can|not &s;ee &s;uch evil in it. There are other &s;ins which often trouble natural men's con&s;ciences, when this &s;in of unbelief troubles them not at all, though it be that which brings far greater guilt upon them, than tho&s;e &s;ins about which they are more troubled.</P>
<P>THIS that has been now &s;aid may &s;how why unbe|lief is &s;poken of as &s;uch a heinous &s;in, as it is, Joh. iii. 18. and chap. xvi. 9. and 1. Joh. v. 10. For there|by all the glory and excellency of Chri&s;t is &s;et at nought, though it be &s;o great; though it be infinite; though it be the glory of the godhead it&s;elf, and though it has been &s;o gloriou&s;ly manife&s;ted in what Chri&s;t has done and &s;uffered. Natural men in their unbelief ca&s;t contempt on all this glory, and tread it under foot, as being nothing worth. Their unbelief treats the excellency of Chri&s;t, as being of le&s;s value than the meane&s;t earthly enjoyments.</P>
<P>II. THIS doctrine may convict natural men in four particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. HEREBY you may be convinced of the great|ne&s;s of your guilt. Con&s;ider how great and excel|lent that per&s;on is, whom you thus &s;et at nought. Contempt of any per&s;on is heinous in proportion to the worthine&s;s and dignity of the per&s;on contemned. Though we are but men, and worms of the du&s;t, and very vile, &s;inful creatures; yet we take it grievou&s;ly, when we are de&s;pi&s;ed. Con&s;ider how you your&s;elves are ready to re&s;ent it, when any of your neighbours
<PB N="67" REF="016767_0065_0F9E1F1F35FCADC0">
&s;eem to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">light you, and &s;et light by what you &s;ay and do, and to make no account of it, but to treat you as if you were good for nothing, or not worth mind|ing. Do you take this well of your neighbours and equals, when you ob&s;erve any thing of this nature? are you not ready to look upon it with re&s;entment, to think very ill of it, and to judge that you have great cau&s;e to be offended?</P>
<P>BUT if it be &s;uch a crime to de&s;pi&s;e you and &s;et you at nought, what is it to &s;et at nought the eternal in|finitely glorious &s;on of GOD, in compari&s;on with whom you and all nations are nothing and le&s;s than nothing and vanity? You di&s;like it much to be con|temned by your equals; but you would take it yet more greivou&s;ly to be de&s;pi&s;ed by your inferiors, by tho&s;e whom one every account you much excel.&mdash;What a crime is it then for a vile, &s;inful worm, to &s;et at nought him who is the brightne&s;s of the glory of the king of kings!</P>
<P>IT would be a crime inexpre&s;&s;ibly heinous to &s;et <HI>little</HI> by the glory and excellency of &s;uch a per&s;on; but it is more &s;o, to &s;et <HI>nothing at all</HI> by it, as you do. You have no value at all for it, as has been &s;hown.&mdash;And this is the more aggravated, as Chri&s;t is a per&s;on whom you &s;o much need, and as he came into the world out of infinite grace to &s;inners, to lay down his life to deliver them from hell, and purcha&s;e for them eternal glory. How much has Chri&s;t done and &s;uffered, that you might have opportunity to be &s;a|ved! Yet you &s;et nothing by it all; you &s;et nothing by the blood of Chri&s;t, even by that blood that was &s;hed for &s;uch poor &s;inners as you are, and that is of|fered to you for your &s;alvation. But you trample under foot the blood of the &s;on of GOD.&mdash;If Chri&s;t had come into the world only <HI>to teach</HI> us, it would
<PB N="68" REF="016767_0066_0F9E1F1FE22C1F88">
have been a heinous thing, to trample under foot his word and in&s;tructions. But when he came <HI>to die</HI> for us, how much more heinous is it to trample under foot his <HI>blood!</HI></P>
<P>MEN take it hardly to have any of their qualifica|tions or actions de&s;pi&s;ed, which they e&s;teem commen|dable. But e&s;pecially do they highly re&s;ent it, when others &s;light their kindne&s;s. And above all when they have put them&s;elves out of their way, and have deni|ed them&s;elves, and &s;uffered con&s;iderably to do others a kindne&s;s; then to have their kindne&s;s de&s;pi&s;ed, and &s;et at nought, is what men would above all things re|&s;ent. How heinous then is it, and how exceedingly provoking to GOD mu&s;t it be, thus to &s;et at nought &s;o great kindne&s;s and love of CHRIST, when from love to &s;inners he &s;uffered &s;o much?</P>
<P>CONSIDER how highly the angels who are &s;o much above you, do &s;et by the glory and excellency of Chri&s;t, by which you &s;et nothing. They admire and adore the glory of Chri&s;t, and cea&s;e not day nor night to prai&s;e the &s;ame in the mo&s;t exalted &s;trains. Rev. v. 11. 12. <Q>And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne, and the bea&s;ts, and the elders: and the number of them was ten thou&s;and times ten thou&s;and, and thou&s;ands of thou&s;ands&punc; &s;aying with a loud voice, worthy is the lamb that was &s;lain, to receive power, and riches, and wi&s;dom, and &s;trength, and honour, and glory, and ble&s;&s;ing.</Q> The &s;aints admire the excellency of Chri&s;t, and the glorious angels admire it, and every creature in heaven and earth, but only you unbelieving children of men.</P>
<P>CONSIDER not only how much the angels &s;et by the glory of Chri&s;t, but how much GOD him&s;elf &s;ets by it: for he is the darling of heaven, he was eternally GOD'S delight; and becau&s;e of his glory GOD hath
<PB N="69" REF="016767_0067_0F9E1F20A9C14908">
thought him worthy to be appointed the heir of all things, and hath &s;een fit to ordain that all men <HI>&s;hould honour the &s;on even as they honour the father.</HI>&mdash;Is he thus worthy of the infinite e&s;teem and love of GOD him&s;elf? and is he worthy of no e&s;teem from you?</P>
<P N="2">2. HEREBY you may be convinced of your dan|ger. You mu&s;t needs think, that &s;uch guilt will bring great wrath: doubtle&s;s GOD is dreadfully pro|voked by your thus de&s;pi&s;ing Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Dread|ful de&s;truction is denounced in &s;cripture again&s;t tho&s;e that de&s;pi&s;e only the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t; Mat. xviii. 6. What de&s;truction then will come on them that de&s;|pi&s;e all the glorious excellency of Chri&s;t him&s;elf!</P>
<P>CONSIDER that you not only have no value for all the glory and excellency of Chri&s;t; but you are ene|mies to him on that very account. The very ground of that enmity and oppo&s;ition which there is between your hearts and Je&s;us Chri&s;t, is the glorious perfecti|ons and excellencies that there are in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. By being &s;uch an holy and excellent Saviour, he is contrary to your lu&s;ts and corruptions: If there were a Saviour offered to you that was agreeable to your corrupt nature, &s;uch a Saviour you would fall in with the offer of; &s;uch a Saviour you would accept. But Chri&s;t being a Saviour of &s;uch purity, holine&s;s, and divine perfection, this is the cau&s;e why you have no inclination to him, but are offended in him.</P>
<P>INSTEAD of being a precious &s;tone in your eyes, he is a &s;tone of &s;tumbling and a rock of offence to you. That he is a Saviour who hath manife&s;ted &s;uch di|vine perfections in what he hath done and &s;uffered, is one principal rea&s;on why you &s;et nothing by him.&mdash;Con&s;ider how provoking this mu&s;t needs be to GOD the Father, who has given his only begotten &s;on for your &s;alvation; and what wrath it merits from the &s;on whom you thus treat. And con&s;ider how you will hereafter bear this wrath.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="016767_0068_0F9E1F215D270EF8">
CONSIDER that however Chri&s;t be &s;et at nought by you, yet he &s;hall be the head of the corner, and that even with re&s;pect to you. Though you &s;et him low, yet he &s;hall be exalted with re&s;pect to you. It is but a vain thing for you to make light of Chri&s;t and treat him with contempt. How much &s;oever you contemn him, you cannot break his bands a&s;under, nor ca&s;t his cords from you. You will &s;till be in his hands. While you de&s;pi&s;e Chri&s;t, GOD will de&s;pi&s;e you, and the Lord will have you in deri&s;ion. GOD will &s;et his king on his holy hill of Zion in &s;pite of all his enemies: P&s;al. ii. 1&mdash;6. Though you &s;ay we will not have this man to reign over us, yet Chri&s;t will rule over you&punc; P&s;al. cx. 2. <Q>Rule thou in the mid&s;t of thine enemies.</Q> If you will not &s;umbit to the &s;ceptre of his grace, you &s;hall be &s;ubject to the rod of his wrath, and he will rule you with a rod of iron: P&s;al. ii. 9, 10, 11, 12.</P>
<P N="3">3. You may hence be led to &s;ee how worthle&s;s many of tho&s;e things in your&s;elves are, that you have been ready to make much of. Particularly, if it be &s;o that you &s;et nothing by all the glory of Chri&s;t, then what are tho&s;e de&s;ires that you have after Chri&s;t, good for? and that willingne&s;s that you think you find, to come to Chri&s;t?&mdash;Sinners are often wont to excu&s;e them&s;elves in their unbelief with this, that they &s;ee not but that they are wiling to come to Chri&s;t, and would gladly come to him if they could, and have great de&s;ires to come to him. And they make much of &s;uch a willingne&s;s and &s;uch de&s;ires, as though GOD were unju&s;t to puni&s;h them for not coming to Chri&s;t, when they would gladly come to Chri&s;t if they could. But this doctrine &s;hows that your wil|lingne&s;s and de&s;ires to come to Chri&s;t, are not wor|thy to be mentioned as any excu&s;e: for they are not
<PB N="71" REF="016767_0069_0F9E1F221C061E38">
from any re&s;pect to Chri&s;t, but are merely forced&punc; you at the &s;ame time &s;et Chri&s;t at nought; or &s;et no|thing by all his excellency and glory.</P>
<P>SO you may hence learn the worthle&s;&s;ne&s;s of all your pains and endeavours after Chri&s;t. When &s;in|ners have taken a great deal of pains to get an inter|e&s;t in Chri&s;t, they are wont to make a righteou&s;ne&s;s of it; little con&s;idering that at the very time they are taking &s;o much pains to get an intere&s;t in Chri&s;t, they &s;et nothing at all by Chri&s;t, for any glory or excel|lency that there is in him; but &s;et him wholly at nought, and &s;eek him out of re&s;pect to their own intere&s;t.</P>
<P N="4">4. HENCE learn how ju&s;tly GOD might for ever refu&s;e to give you an intere&s;t in Chri&s;t. For why &s;hould GOD give you any part or intere&s;t in him whom you &s;et at nought, all who&s;e glory and excel|lency you value not in the lea&s;t, but rather trample it under your feet, and prefer the dirt before it.</P>
<P>WHY &s;hould GOD ever give you any intere&s;t in him whom you &s;o de&s;pi&s;e? &s;eeing you de&s;pi&s;e him, how ju&s;tly might you be obliged to go without any inter|e&s;t in him! How ju&s;tly might you be refu&s;ed any part in that precious &s;tone, who&s;e preciou&s;ne&s;s you make no account of, and e&s;teem no more than that of the &s;tones of the &s;treet!&mdash;Is GOD obliged to ca&s;t &s;uch a pearl before &s;wine who will trample it un|der their feet? Is GOD obliged to make you po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ors of his infinitely glorious and dear &s;on, when at the &s;ame time you count him not worth the having, for the &s;ake of any worth or excellency that there is in him; but merely becau&s;e you cannot e&s;cape hell without him?</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>LUKE, xvii. 32.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>Remember Lots Wife.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>CHRIST is here foretelling his coming in his kingdom, in an&s;wer to the que&s;tion which the Phari&s;ees a&s;ked him, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>When the kingdom of God &s;hould come.</HI> And in what he &s;ays of his coming, he evidently has re&s;pect to two things, his coming at the de&s;truction of Jeru&s;alem, and his coming to the general judgment, at the end of the world. He com|pares his coming at tho&s;e times, to the coming of GOD in two remarkable judgments that were pa&s;t; fir&s;t to that in the time of the flood; <Q>and as it was in the days of Noe, &s;o &s;hall it be al&s;o in the days of the &s;on of man.</Q> Nextly he compares it to the de&s;truction of Sodom and Gomorrah: <Q>likewi&s;e al|&s;o, as it was in the days of Lot&mdash;even <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;hall it be in the day when the &s;on of man is revealed.</Q></P>
<P>THEN he immediately proceeds to direct his peo|ple how they &s;hould behave them&s;elves at the ap|pearance
<PB N="74" REF="016767_0071_0F9E1F2610EED2D8">
of the &s;ignal of the approach of that day, referring e&s;pecially to the de&s;truction of Jeru&s;alem. <Q>In that day, he which &s;hall be upon the hou&s;e top, and his &s;tuff in the hou&s;e, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewi&s;e not return back.</Q> In which words Chri&s;t &s;hows that they &s;hould make the utmo&s;t ha&s;te to flee and get out of the city to the mountains, as he commands Mat. xxiv. 15. &amp;c. <Q>When ye there|fore &s;hall &s;ee the abomination of de&s;olation &s;poken of by Daniel the prophet &s;tand in the holy place, then let them which be in Judea, flee to the moun|tains; let him which is in the hou&s;e-top, not come down to take any thing out of the hou&s;e; neither let him which is in the field, turn back to take his clothes.</Q></P>
<P>JERUSALEM was like Sodom in that it was devot|ed to de&s;truction, by &s;pecial divine wrath, as that was; and indeed to a more terrible de&s;truction than Sodom was. Therefore the like direction is given concerning fleeing out of it with the utmo&s;t ha&s;te, without looking behind, as the angel gave to Lot, when he bid him flee out of Sodom; Gen. xix. 17. <Q>E&s;cape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither &s;tay thou in all the plain.</Q>&mdash;And in the text Chri&s;t enforces his council by the in&s;tance of Lot's wife. He bids them remember her and take warning by her, who looked back as &s;he was fleeing out of Sodom, and became a pillar of &s;alt.</P>
<P>IF it be inquired why Chri&s;t gave this direction to his people to flee out of Jeru&s;alem, in &s;uch exceeding ha&s;te, at the fir&s;t notice of the &s;ignal of her approach|ing de&s;truction; I an&s;wer, it &s;eems to be becau&s;e flee|ing out of Jeru&s;alem was a type of fleeing out of a &s;tate of &s;in. E&s;caping out of that unbelieving city
<PB N="75" REF="016767_0072_0F9E1F2820A26E60">
typified an e&s;cape out of a &s;tate of unbelief. There|fore they were directed to flee without &s;taying to take any thing out of their hou&s;es, to &s;ignify with what ha&s;te and greatne&s;s of concern, we &s;hould flee out of a natural condition, that no re&s;pect to any worldly enjoyment &s;hould prevent or delay us one moment, and that we &s;hould flee to Je&s;us Chri&s;t the refuge of &s;ouls, our &s;trong rock, and the mount of our defence, &s;o as in fleeing to him, to leave and for&s;ake heartily all earthly things.</P>
<P>THIS &s;eems to be the chief rea&s;on al&s;o, why Lot was directed to make &s;uch ha&s;te, and not to look be|hind; becau&s;e his fleeing out of Sodom was de&s;igned on purpo&s;e to be a type of our fleeing from that &s;tate of &s;in and mi&s;ery in which we naturally are.</P>
<P>DOCTRINE. We ought not to look back, when we are fleeing out of Sodom.&mdash;The following rea&s;ons may be &s;ufficient to &s;upport this doctrine;</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT Sodom is a city full of filthine&s;s and abominations. It is a filthy and abominable city; it is full of tho&s;e impurities that are worthy to be had in the utmo&s;t abhorrence and dete&s;tation by all. The inhabitants of it are a polluted company, they are all under the power and dominion of hateful lu&s;ts. All their faculties and affections are polluted with tho&s;e vile di&s;po&s;itions that are unworthy of the human nature, that greatly deba&s;e it, that are exceedingly hate|ful to GOD and dreadfully incen&s;e his anger. Every kind of &s;piritual abomination abounds in it: in So|dom there is all filthine&s;s that can be thought of. There is nothing &s;o hateful and abominable but that there it is to be found and there it abounds.</P>
<P>SODOM is a city full of devils and all unclean &s;pi|rits: there they have their rendezvous, and there they have their dominion. There they and tho&s;e that are
<PB N="76" REF="016767_0073_0F9E1F29FA3A5770">
like unto them, do &s;port and wallow them&s;elves in fil|thine&s;s; as it is &s;aid of my&s;tical Babylon, Rev. xviii. 2. Babylon&mdash;is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul &s;pirit, and the cage of every un|clean and hateful bird.&mdash;Who would be of &s;uch a &s;ociety? who would not flee from &s;uch a city with the utmo&s;t ha&s;te, and never look back upon it, and never have the lea&s;t inclination of returning, or hav|ing any thing to do there any more?</P>
<P>SOME in Sodom may &s;eem to carry a fair face and make a fair outward &s;how; but if we could look in|to their hearts, they are every one altogether filthy and abominable. We ought to flee from &s;uch a city, with the utmo&s;t abhorrence of the place and &s;ociety, with no de&s;ires to dwell longer there, and never to di&s;cover the lea&s;t inclination to return to it; but &s;hould be de&s;irous to get to the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible di&s;tance from it, that we might in no wi&s;e be partakers in her abominations.</P>
<P N="2">2. WE ought not to look back, when fleeing out of Sodom, becau&s;e Sodom is a city appointed to de&s;|truction. The cry of the city hath reached up to heaven. The earth cannot bear &s;uch a burden as her inhabitants are; &s;he will therefore di&s;burden her&s;elf of them, and &s;pue them out. GOD will not &s;uffer &s;uch a city to &s;tand; he will con&s;ume it. GOD is an holy GOD and his nature is infinitely oppo&s;ite to all &s;uch uncleanne&s;s as Sodom is full of; he will therefore be a con&s;uming fire to it. The holine&s;s of GOD will not &s;uffer it to &s;tand, and the maje&s;ty and ju&s;tice of GOD require that the inhabitants of that city, who thus of|fend and provoke him, be de&s;troyed. And GOD will &s;urely de&s;troy them; it is the immutable and irrever|&s;able decree of GOD. He hath &s;aid it and he will do it. The decree is gone forth, and &s;o &s;ure as there
<PB N="77" REF="016767_0074_0F9E1F2A6D2D4EC0">
is a GOD, and he is almighty and able to fulfil his decrees and threatenings, &s;o &s;urely will he de&s;troy Sodom. Gen. xix. 12, 13. <Q>What&s;oever thou ha&s;t in this city bring them out of this place; for we will de&s;troy this place, becau&s;e the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord, and the Lord hath &s;ent us to de&s;troy it.</Q> And ver&s;e. 14. <Q>Up, get ye out of this place; for the Lord will de|&s;troy this city.</Q></P>
<P>THIS city is an accur&s;ed city; it is de&s;tined to ru|in. Therefore as we would not be partakers of her cur&s;e, and would not be de&s;troyed, we &s;hould flee out of it and not look behind us. Rev. xviii. 4. <Q>Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her &s;ins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.</Q></P>
<P N="3">3. WE ought not to look back when fleeing out of Sodom, becau&s;e the de&s;truction to which it is ap|pointed, is exceedingly dreadful: it is appointed to utter de&s;truction, to be wholly and entirely con&s;um|ed.&mdash;It is appointed to &s;uffer the wrath of the great GOD, which is to be poured down from GOD upon it, like a dreadful &s;torm of fire and brim&s;tone. This city is to be filled full of the wrath of GOD. Every one that remains in it &s;hall have the fire of GOD'S wrath come down on his head and into his &s;oul: he &s;hall be full of fire and full of the wrath of the Almighty.&mdash;He &s;hall be encompa&s;&s;ed with fire with|out and full of fire within: his head, his heart, his bowels and all his limbs &s;hall be full of fire, and not a drop of water to cool him.</P>
<P>NOR &s;hall he have any place to flee to for relief. Go where he will, there is the fire of GOD'S wrath: his de&s;truction and torment will be inevitable.&mdash;He &s;hall be de&s;troyed without any pity. He &s;hall cry aloud, but there &s;hall be none to help, there &s;hall be none to
<PB N="78" REF="016767_0075_0F9E1F2B39904C30">
regard his lamentations, or to afford relief. The decree is gone forth, and the days come when Sodom &s;hall burn as an oven, and all the inhabitants thereof &s;hall be as &s;tubble. As it was in the literal Sodom, the whole city was full of fire: in their hou&s;es there was no &s;afety, for they were all on fire; and if they fled out into the &s;treets, they al&s;o were full of fire. Fire continually came down out of heaven every where.&mdash;That was a di&s;mal time. What a cry was there then in that city, in every part of it! But there was none to help; they had no where to go, where they could hide their heads from fire: They had none to pity or relieve them. If they fled to their friends, they could not help them.</P>
<P>Now with what ha&s;te &s;hould we flee from a city appointed to &s;uch a de&s;truction! and how &s;hould we flee without looking behind us! how &s;hould it be our whole intent, and what we with all our minds and might are engaged about, to get at the greate&s;t di&s;|tance from a city in &s;uch circum&s;tances! how far &s;hould we be from thinking at all of returning to a city which has &s;uch wrath hanging over it!</P>
<P N="4">4. THE de&s;truction to which Sodom is appointed is an univer&s;al de&s;truction. None that &s;tay in it &s;hall e&s;cape: none will have the good fortune, to be in any by-corner, where the fire will not &s;earch them out. All &s;orts, old and young, great and &s;mall &s;hall be de&s;troyed. There &s;hall be no exception of any age, or any &s;ex, or any condition, but all &s;hall peri&s;h together. Gen. xix. 24, 25. <Q>Then the Lord rain|ed upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brim&s;tone and fire from the Lord out of heaven, and he over|threw tho&s;e cities and all the plain, and all the in|habitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.</Q> We therefore mu&s;t not longer de|lay
<PB N="79" REF="016767_0076_0F9E1F2BDCEC1550">
or look behind us; for there is no place of &s;afety in Sodom, nor in all the plain on which Sodom is built. The mountain of &s;afety is before us and not behind us.</P>
<P N="5">5. THE de&s;truction to which Sodom is appoint|ed is an everla&s;ting de&s;truction. This is &s;aid of the literal Sodom, that it &s;uffered the vengeance of eter|nal fire, Jude vii. <Q>Even as Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities about them, in like manner giving them&s;elves over to fornication, and going after &s;trange fle&s;h, are &s;et forth for an example, &s;uffer|ing the vengeance of eternal fire.</Q>&mdash;That de&s;truc|tion that Sodom and Gomorrah &s;uffered, was an eter|nal de&s;truction: tho&s;e cities were de&s;troyed and have never been built &s;ince, and are not capable of being rebuilt; for the land on which they &s;tood, at the time of their de&s;truction &s;unk and has been ever &s;ince co|vered with the lake of Sodom or the dead &s;ea, or as it is called in &s;cripture, <HI>the &s;alt &s;ea.</HI> This &s;eems to have been thus ordered on purpo&s;e to be a type of the e|ternal de&s;truction of ungodly men. So that fire by which they were de&s;troyed, is called <HI>eternal fire,</HI> be|cau&s;e it was &s;o typically, it was a type of the eternal de&s;truction of ungodly men; which may be in part what is intended, when it is &s;aid in that text in Jude, that they were &s;et forth for an example, or for a type or repre&s;entation of the eternal fire in which all the ungodly are to be con&s;umed.</P>
<P>SODOM has in all ages &s;ince been covered with a lake which was fir&s;t brought on it by fire and brim|&s;tone, to be a type of the lake of fire and brim&s;tone in which ungodly men &s;hall have their part forever and ever, as we read Rev. xx. 15. and el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>WE ought not therefore to look back when flee|ing out of Sodom, &s;eeing that the de&s;truction to
<PB N="80" REF="016767_0077_0F9E1F2C9E74DC18">
which it is appointed is an eternal, de&s;truction; for this renders the de&s;truction truly infinitely dreadful.</P>
<P N="6">6. SODOM is a city appointed to &s;wift and &s;udden de&s;truction. The de&s;truction is not only certain and inevitable, and infinitely dreadful, but it will come &s;peedily. <Q>Their judgment lingereth not, and their damnation &s;lumbereth not;</Q> 2. Pet. ii. 3. And &s;o Deut. xxxii. 35. <Q>The day of their calamity is at hand and the things that &s;hall come upon them, make ha&s;te.</Q>&mdash;The &s;torm of wrath, the black clouds of divine vengeance even now every moment hang over them, ju&s;t ready to break forth and come down in a dreadful manner upon them. GOD hath already whet his &s;word and bent his bow, and made ready his arrow on the &s;tring: P&s;al. vii. 12.&mdash;Therefore we &s;hould make ha&s;te and not look behind us. For if we linger and &s;top to look back, and flee not for our lives, there is great danger that we &s;hall be involved in the common ruin.</P>
<P>THE de&s;truction of SODOM is not only &s;wift, but will come &s;uddenly and unexpectedly.&mdash;It &s;eems to have been a fair morning in Sodom, on the morn|ing that it was de&s;troyed. There is notice taken of the time when the &s;un ro&s;e that morning: Gen. xix. 23. It &s;eems that there were no clouds to be &s;een, no ap|pearance of any &s;torm at all, much le&s;s of a &s;torm of fire and brim&s;tone. The inhabitants of Sodom ex|pected no &s;uch thing: even when Lot told his &s;ons in law of it, they would not believe it; Gen. xix. 14.&mdash;They were making merry; their hearts were at ea&s;e, they thought nothing of &s;uch a calamity at hand. But it came at once, as travail upon a woman with child, and there was no e&s;cape; as it is ob&s;erved in the context v. 28, 29. <Q>They did eat, they drank; they bought, they &s;old; they planted, they build|ed:

<PB N="81" REF="016767_0078_0F9E1F2D68CC4A48">
but the &s;ame day that Lot went out of Sodom, it rained fire and brim&s;tone from heaven and de|&s;troy them all.</Q></P>
<P>So it is with wicked men; P&s;al. lxxiii. 19. <Q>How are they brought into de&s;olation in a moment: they are utterly con&s;umed with terrors.</Q>&mdash;If therefore we linger and look back, we may be &s;ud|denly overtaken and &s;eized with de&s;truction.</P>
<P N="7">7. THERE is nothing in Sodom that is worth looking back upon. All the enjoyments of Sodom will &s;oon peri&s;h in the common de&s;truction. All will be burnt up. And &s;urely it is not worth the while to look back on things that are peri&s;hing and con&s;uming in the flames, as it is with all the enjoy|ments of &s;in; they are all appointed to the fire. Therefore it is fooli&s;h for any who are fleeing out of Sodom, to hanker any more after them; for when they are burnt up, what good can they do? And is it worth the while for us to return back for the &s;ake of a moment's enjoyment of them, before they are burnt, and &s;o expo&s;e our&s;elves to be burnt up with them?</P>
<P>LOT'S wife looked back becau&s;e &s;he remembered the plea&s;ant things that &s;he left in Sodom. She hat|ed to leave them; &s;he hankered after them; &s;he could not but look back with a wi&s;hful eye upon the city, where &s;he had lived in &s;uch ea&s;e and plea|&s;ure.&mdash;Sodom was a place of great outward plenty; they ate the fat and drank the &s;weet. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oil where Sodom was built was exceedingly fruitful; it is &s;aid to be as <HI>the garden of God,</HI> Gen. xii. 10.

<P>HERE Lot and his wife lived plentifully, and it was a place where the inhabitants wallowed in carnal plea&s;ures and delights. But however much it a|bounded in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e things, what where they worth now,

when the city was burning? Lot's wife was very fooli&s;h in lingering in her e&s;cape, for the &s;ake of things which were all on fire.&mdash;So the enjoyments, the profits and plea&s;ures of &s;in, have the wrath and cur&s;e of GOD on them: brim&s;tone is &s;cattered on them: hell-fire is ready to kindle on them. It is not therefore worth while for any per&s;on to look back after &s;uch things.</P>
<P N="8">8. WE are warned by me&s;&s;engers &s;ent to us from GOD to make ha&s;te in our flight from Sodom, and not to look behind us. GOD &s;ends to us his mini&s;ters, the angels of the churches, on this grand errand, as he &s;ent the angels to warn Lot and his wife to flee for their lives, and to &s;ay and do as we have account in Gen. xix. 15, 16.&mdash;If we delay or look back, now that we have had &s;uch fair warning, we &s;hall be exceedingly inexcu&s;able and mon&s;trou&s;ly fooli&s;h.</P>

The whole hi&s;tory of the de&s;truction of Sodom with all its cir|cum&s;tances &s;eems to be in&s;erted in the &s;criptures for our warning and is &s;et forth for an example, as the apo&s;tle Jude &s;ays.

CONSIDER therefore what the &s;tate is, that you are to get out of, you that are &s;eeking an intere&s;t in Chri&s;t: you are to flee out of Sodom. Sodom is the place of your nativity, and the place where you have &s;pent your lives hitherto. You are citizens of that city, which is full of filthine&s;s and abomination before GOD, that polluted and accur&s;ed city. You belong to that impure &s;ociety. You not only live a|mong them, but you are of them, you are &s;ome that have committed tho&s;e abominations, and have &s;o pro|voked GOD as you have heard. It is you that I have all this while been &s;peaking of under this doctrine; you are the inhabitants of Sodom. Perhaps you may look on your circum&s;tances, as not very dread|ful; but you dwell in Sodom.&mdash;Though you may be reformed and appear with a clean out&s;ide and a &s;mooth face to the world; yet as long as you are in a natural condition, you are impure inhabitants of Sodom.</P>
<P>THE world of mankind is divided into two compa|nies, or as I may &s;ay, into two cities: there is the ci|ty of Zion, the church of GOD, the holy and beloved city; and there is Sodom that polluted and accur&s;ed city, which is appointed to de&s;truction. You belong to the latter of the&s;e. How much &s;oever you may look upon your&s;elves better than &s;ome others, yet you are of the &s;ame city; the &s;ame company, with fornicators, and drunkards, and adulterers, and com|mon &s;wearers, and high-way-men, and pirates, and So|domites. How much &s;oever you may think your|&s;elves di&s;tingui&s;hed, as long as you are out of Chri&s;t, you belong to the very &s;ame &s;ociety; you are of the company, you join with them, and are no better than they, any otherwi&s;e than as you have greater re&s;traints. You are con&s;idered in the &s;ight of GOD, as fit to be ranked with them. You and they are altogether the objects of the loathing and abhorrence of GOD, and

have the wrath of GOD abiding on you; you will go with them and be de&s;troyed with them, if you do not e&s;cape from your pre&s;ent &s;tate. Yea you are of the &s;ame &s;ociety and the &s;ame company with the de|vils, for Sodom is not only the city of wicked men, but it is the hold of every foul &s;pirit.</P>
<P>YOU belong to that city that is appointed to an aw|ful, inevitable, univer&s;al, &s;wift and &s;udden de&s;tructi|on; a city that has a &s;torm of fire and wrath hanging over it. Many of you are convinced of the awful &s;tate you are in, while in Sodom, and are making &s;ome attempts to e&s;cape from the wrath which hangs over it.

Look not back unle&s;s you choo&s;e to have a &s;hare in the burning tempe&s;t that is coming down on that ci|ty.&mdash;Look not back in remembrance of the enjoy|ments which you have had in Sodom, as hankering after the plea&s;ant things which you have had there, after the ea&s;e, the &s;ecurity, and the plea&s;ure which you have there enjoyed.</P>

<Q><HI>Remember Lot's Wife.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>DOCTRINE. WE ought not to look back, when we are fleeing out of Sodom.</P>
<P>HAVING confirmed this doctrine by &s;everal rea|&s;ons, we come to the application of it in an u&s;e of warning to &s;inners in a natural &s;tate, and e&s;pecially to tho&s;e who are awakened and convinced of the aw|ful &s;tate in which they are, and are de&s;irous of e&s;cap|ing the wrath which is to come. And further to en|force this warning, let me entreat all you who are in this &s;tate, to con&s;ider the&s;e &s;everal things which I &s;hall now mention;</P>
<P N="1">1. THE de&s;truction of which you are in danger is infinitely more dreadful than that de&s;truction of the literal Sodom from which Lot fled. The de|&s;truction of Sodom and Gomorrah in a &s;torm of fire and brim&s;tone, was but a &s;hadow of the de&s;truction of ungodly men in hell, and is no more to it than a &s;hadow or a picture is to a reality, or than painted fire is to real fire. The mi&s;ery of hell is &s;et forth by va|rious
<PB N="86" REF="016767_0083_0F9E1F34E964F068">
&s;hadows and images in &s;cripture, as blackne&s;s of darkne&s;s, a never dying worm, a furnance of fire, a lake of fire and brim&s;tone, the torments of the valley of the &s;on of Hinnom, a &s;torm of fire and brim&s;tone. The rea&s;on why &s;o many &s;imilitudes are made u&s;e of, is becau&s;e none of them are &s;ufficient. Any one does but partly and very imperfectly repre&s;ent the truth, and therefore GOD makes u&s;e of many.</P>
<P>YOU have therefore much more need to make ha&s;te in your e&s;cape, and not to look behind you, than Lot and his wife had when they fled out of Sodom; for you are every day and every moment in danger of a thou&s;and times more dreadful &s;torm coming on your heads, than that which came on Sodom, when the Lord rained brim&s;tone and fire from the Lord out of heaven upon them; &s;o that it will be va&s;tly more &s;otti&s;h in you to look back, than it was in Lot's wife.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE de&s;truction you are in danger of, is not only greater than the temporal de&s;truction of Sodom, but greater than the eternal de&s;truction of the inhabitants of Sodom. For however well you may think you have be|haved your&s;elves, you who have continued impenitent under the glorious go&s;pel, have &s;inned more and provok|ed GOD far more, and have greater guilt upon you, than the inhabitants of Sodom; although you may &s;eem to your&s;elves, and perhaps to others, to be very harmle&s;s creatures. Mat. x. 15. Verily I &s;ay unto you, it &s;hall be more tolerable for Sodom and Go|morrah in the day of judgment, than for that city.</P>
<P N="3">3. MULTITUDES while they have been looking back, have been &s;uddenly overtaken and &s;eized by the &s;torm of wrath. The wrath of GOD hath not delayed, while they have delayed; it has not waited at all for them to repent, to turn about and flee; but has pre&s;ently &s;eized them, and they have been pa&s;t
<PB N="87" REF="016767_0084_0F9E1F359E597860">
hope.&mdash;When Lot's wife looked back &s;he was im|mediately de&s;troyed, GOD had exerci&s;ed patience to|warks her before. When &s;he lingered at the &s;etting out, the angels pre&s;&s;ed her, her hu&s;band and children, to make ha&s;te. Not only &s;o, but when they yet de|layed, they laid hold on her hands, and brought her forth and &s;et her without the city, the Lord being merciful to her. But now when notwith&s;tanding this mercy and the warnings which had been given her, &s;he looked back, GOD exerci&s;ed no more pati|ence towards her, but proceeded in wrath immedi|ately to put her to death.</P>
<P>NOW GOD has in like manner been merciful to you. You in time pa&s;t have been lingering; you have been warned by the angel of your danger and pre&s;&s;ed to make ha&s;te and flee; yet you have delayed. And now at length God hath as it were laid hold on you, by the convictions of his &s;pirit, to draw you out of Sodom; Therefore <HI>remember Lot's wife.</HI> If now af|ter all you &s;hould look back, when GOD hath been &s;o merciful to you; you will have rea&s;on to fear, that GOD will &s;uddenly de&s;troy you and wait no longer on you. Multitudes when they have been looking back and putting off to another opportunity, they have never had another opportunity; they have been &s;uddenly de&s;troyed and that without remedy.</P>
<P N="4">4. IF you look back and live long after it, there will be great danger that you will never get any fur|ther. The only way to &s;eek &s;alvation is to pre&s;s for|ward with all your might, and &s;till to look and pre&s;s forward, never to &s;tand &s;till or &s;lacken your pace.&mdash;When Lot's wife &s;topped in her flight, and &s;tood &s;till in order that &s;he might look, her puni&s;hment was that there &s;he was to &s;tand forever, &s;he never got any farther; &s;he never got beyond that place; but
<PB N="88" REF="016767_0085_0F9E1F365E071A70">
there &s;he &s;tood as a pillar of &s;alt, a durable pillar and monument of wrath, for her folly and wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P>SO it very often is with back&s;liders, though they may live a con&s;iderable time after. When they look back, after they have been taking pains for their &s;al|vation, they lo&s;e all, they put them&s;elves under va&s;t di&s;advantages; by quenching the &s;pirit of GOD, and lo&s;ing their convictions, they dreadfully harden their own hearts and &s;tupify their &s;ouls, make way for di&s;|couragements, dreadfully &s;trengthen and e&s;tabli&s;h the intere&s;t of &s;in in their hearts, many ways give &s;atan great advantages to ruin them, and provoke GOD of|tentimes utterly to leave them to hardne&s;s of heart. When they come to look back, their &s;ouls pre&s;ently become dead and hard like Lot's wife's body: and if this be the ca&s;e, though they live long after, they never get any further; it is wor&s;e for them, than if they were immediately damned. When per&s;ons in fleeing out of Sodom look back, their la&s;t ca&s;e is far wor&s;e than the fir&s;t; Mat. xii. 43, 44, 45.&mdash;And experience confirms that none ordinarily are &s;o hard to be brought to repentance as back&s;liders.</P>
<P N="5">5. It may well &s;tir you up to flee for your lives, and not to look behind you, when you con&s;ider, how many have lately fled to the mountain, while you yet remain in Sodom. To what multitudes hath GOD given the wi&s;dom to flee to CHRIST the mountain of &s;afety! They have fled to the little city Zoar, which GOD will &s;pare and never de&s;troy. How many have you &s;een of all &s;orts re&s;orting out of Sodom thither, as believing the word of GOD by the angels, that God would &s;urely de&s;troy that place. They are in a &s;afe condition; they are got out of the reach of the &s;torm&punc; the fire and brim&s;tone can do them no hurt there.</P>
<P>BUT you yet remain in that cur&s;ed city among the
<PB N="89" REF="016767_0086_0F9E1F37255A9B58">
accur&s;ed company. You are yet in Sodom, which GOD is about &s;o terribly to de&s;troy, where you are in danger every minute of having &s;nares, fire and brim|&s;tone come down on your head.&mdash;Though &s;o many have obtained, yet you have not obtained deliverance. Good has come, but you have &s;een none of it. Others are happy, but no one knows what will become of you: you have no part nor lot in that glorious &s;al|vation of &s;ouls, which has lately been among us.&mdash;The con&s;ideration of this &s;hould &s;tir you up effectual|ly to e&s;cape, and in your e&s;cape to pre&s;s forward, &s;till to pre&s;s forward, and to re&s;olve to pre&s;s forward for ever, let what will be in the way, to hearken to no temptation, and never to look back, or in any wi&s;e &s;lacken or abate your endeavours as long as you live, but if po&s;&s;ible to increa&s;e in them more and more</P>
<P N="6">6. BACKSLIDING after &s;uch a time as this,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The time of the revival of religion at Northampton, A. D. 1735.</NOTE> will have a va&s;tly greater tendency to &s;eal a man's damna|tion, than at another time. The greater means men have, the louder calls and the greater advantages they are under, the more dangerous is back&s;liding, the more it has a tendency to enhance guilt, to provoke GOD and to harden the heart.</P>
<P>WE in this land of light, have long enjoyed grea|ter advantages, than the mo&s;t of the world. But the advantages which per&s;ons are under now for their, &s;alvation, are perhaps tenfold to what they have been at &s;uch times as we have ordinarily lived in; and back|&s;liding will be proportionably the greater &s;in, and the more dangerous to the &s;oul.&mdash;You have &s;een GOD'S glory and his wonders among&s;t us, in a mo&s;t marvel|lous manner of late. If therefore you look back af|ter this, there will be great danger that GOD will &s;wear in his wrath, that you &s;hall never enter into his re&s;t&punc;

as GOD &s;ware concerning them that were for going back into Egypt, after they had &s;een the wonders which GOD wrought for I&s;rael.

<P N="7">7. WE know not but that great part of the wicked world, are at this day, in Sodom's circum|&s;tances, when Lot fled out of it; having &s;ome out|ward, temporal de&s;truction hanging over it. It looks as if &s;ome great thing were coming; the &s;tate of things in the world &s;eems to be ripe for &s;ome great revolu|tion. The world has got to &s;uch a terrible degree of wickedne&s;s, that it is probable that the cry of it has by this time reached up to heaven; and it is hardly probable that GOD will &s;uffer things to go on, as they now do, much longer. It is likely that GOD will ere long appear in awful maje&s;ty to vindicate his own cau&s;e; and then none will be &s;afe that are out of CHRIST. Now therefore every one &s;hould flee for his life, and e&s;cape to the mountain, left he be con|&s;umed.&mdash;We cannot certainly tell what GOD is about to do, but this we may know, that tho&s;e who are out of CHRIST, are in a mo&s;t un&s;afe &s;tate.</P>
<P N="8">8. TO enforce this warning again&s;t looking back, let me be&s;eech you to con&s;ider the exceeding prone|ne&s;s which there is in the heart to it. The heart of man is a back&s;liding heart. There is in the heart a
<PB N="91" REF="016767_0088_0F9E1F38E316B250">
great love and hankering de&s;ire after the ea&s;e, plea|&s;ure and enjoyments of Sodom, as there was in Lot's wife, by which per&s;ons are continually liable to temp|tations to look back. The heart is &s;o much towards Sodom, that it is a difficult thing to keep the eye from turning that way, and the feet from tending thither. When men under convictions are put upon fleeing, it is a mere force, it is becau&s;e GOD lays hold on their hands, as he did on Lot's and his wife's, and drags them &s;o far. But the tendency of the heart is to go back to Sodom again.</P>
<P>PERSONS are very prone to back-&s;liding, al&s;o thro' di&s;couragement. They are apt to be di&s;couraged. The heart is un&s;teady, &s;oon tired, &s;oon gives out, is apt to li&s;ten to di&s;couraging temptations. A lit|tle difficulty and delay &s;oon overcome it's feeble re|&s;olutions. And di&s;couragement tends to back&s;lid|ing: it weakens per&s;ons hands, lies as a dead weight on their hearts, and makes them drag heavily; and if it continue long, it very often i&s;&s;ues in &s;ecurity and &s;en&s;ele&s;sne&s;s. Convictions are often &s;haken off that way: they begin fir&s;t to go off with di&s;couragement.</P>
<P>BACKSLIDING is a di&s;ea&s;e that is exceeding &s;ecret in its way of working. It is a flattering di&s;temper; it works like a con&s;umption, wherein per&s;ons often flatter them&s;elves that they are not wor&s;e, but &s;ome|thing better, and in a hopeful way to recover, till a few days before they die. So back&s;liding commonly comes on gradually and &s;teals on men in&s;en&s;ibly, and they &s;till flatter them&s;elves that they are not back|&s;lidden. They plead that they are &s;eeking yet, and they hope they have not lo&s;t their convictions. And by the time they find it out, and cannot pretend &s;o any longer, they are commonly &s;o far gone, that they care not much if they have lo&s;t their convictions.
<PB N="92" REF="016767_0089_0F9E1F398FAC67C8">
And when it is come to that, it is commonly a gone ca&s;e with per&s;ons as to tho&s;e convictions.</P>
<P>THUS they blind them&s;elves, and keep them&s;elves in&s;en&s;ible of their own di&s;ea&s;e, and &s;o are not terrified with it, nor awakened to u&s;e means for relief, till it is pa&s;t cure.</P>
<P>THUS it is that back&s;liding commonly comes upon per&s;ons, that have for &s;ome time, been under any con|&s;iderable convictions, and afterwards lo&s;e them. Let the con&s;ideration of this your danger excite you to the greate&s;t care and diligence to keep your hearts, and to watchfulne&s;s and con&s;tant prayer again&s;t back|&s;liding.&mdash;And let it put you upon endeavours to &s;trengthen your re&s;olutions of per&s;evering and guard|ing again&s;t every thing that tends to the contrary, that you may indeed hold out to the end, for <HI>then &s;hall you know, if you follow on to know the Lord.</HI></P>

<P>BUT this &s;eems to be put into the parable chiefly to introduce what follows, the reply which Abraham made to him, <HI>They have Mo&s;es and the prophets, let them hear them.</HI> As much as to &s;ay, They have al|ready abundant warning and in&s;truction, which GOD him&s;elf hath provided for them, let them make u&s;e of that.</P>
<P>THE rich man replies, <HI>Nay, father Abraham, but if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he went unto them from the dead, they will repent.</HI> Then come in the words of the text, And he &s;aid unto him, <HI>If they hear not Mo&s;es and the prophets, neither will they be per&s;uaded, though one ro&s;e from the dead.</HI> By Mo&s;es and the prophets is meant the whole old te&s;tament, which was the whole canon of &s;cripture, which they had in tho&s;e times. The hearing of them implies at|tending to what they &s;ay, believing them, and obey|ing them&punc; <HI>They would not be per&s;uaded,</HI> that is, they would not be per&s;uaded to take thorough care of their &s;ouls, to for&s;ake their &s;ins and turn to GOD, &s;o as to avoid this place of torments. <HI>Though one ro&s;e from the dead;</HI> though one &s;hould go from the invi&s;ible world, either from heaven, where they &s;ee the tor|ments of the damned, or from hell, where they feel them.</P>
<P>DOCTRINE. THE warnings of GOD'S word are more fitted to obtain the ends of awakening &s;inners, and bringing them to repentance, than the ri&s;ing of one from the dead to warn them.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="016767_0092_0F9E1F3ECE1364C0">
IN this pa&s;&s;age Mo&s;es and the prophets &s;eem not only to be equalized to the warnings of one from the invi&s;ible world; but to be preferred before them. They have Mo&s;es and the prophets let them hear them: they have already tho&s;e means, which GOD in his infinite wi&s;dom hath &s;een to be fitte&s;t for them, and more &s;uitable to their nature and circum&s;tances, than the ri&s;ing of one from the dead.&mdash;But whether there can be any more than an equality nece&s;&s;arily inferred, or not; yet if only the warnings of the old te&s;tament have an equal tendency to bring men to repentance, as the ri&s;ing of one from the dead; then &s;urely the&s;e together with the much clearer revalation under the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation by CHRIST and his apo&s;tles, wherein we are abundantly more plainly told of another world, and wherein life and immorta|lity are brought to light; mu&s;t have a much greater tendency and fitne&s;s to obtain the&s;e ends.</P>
<P>SINNERS are apt to find fault with the means of grace which they enjoy, and to &s;ay with them&s;elves, If I had ever &s;een hell, or had ever heard the cries of the damned, or had ever &s;een a per&s;on who had felt hell-torments, or had &s;een them at a di&s;tance; that would awaken me; then I would for&s;ake all my &s;ins, and would do whatever I could to e&s;cape hell. But now I am only told of hell in the bible and by mini&s;|ters; and there never was any in this world that &s;aw or felt it. So that I am ready to think it is mere de|lu&s;ion and fancy. How do I know that there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> hell? How do I know, but that when I die, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> will be an end of me?</P>
<P>BUT it is the indi&s;po&s;ition of &s;inners to this great work, to which they are directed, which makes them find fault with their means and advantages. The &s;lothful and negligent, who hate to be&s;tir them&s;elves,
<PB N="96" REF="016767_0093_0F9E1F3F60513950">
will be objecting. <Q>The way of the &s;lothful is as an hedge of thorns.</Q>&mdash;Sinners know not what they would have. They are fixedly aver&s;e to breaking off their &s;ins by righteou&s;ne&s;s; and to make the mat|ter the more excu&s;able, they object again&s;t the &s;uffi|ciency of their means, and &s;o they will not believe, ex|cept they &s;ee hell, or &s;ee &s;ome per&s;on, who has &s;een it.</P>
<P>BUT GOD who knows our nature and circum&s;tan|ces, knows what is mo&s;t adapted to them. He who made the faculties of our &s;ouls, knows what will have the greate&s;t tendency to move them and to work up|on them. He who is &s;triving with us, to bring us to repentance and &s;alvation, u&s;es the fitte&s;t and be&s;t means. In contriving and appointing the means of our &s;alvation, he choo&s;es better for us than we &s;hould for our&s;elves.</P>
<P>IF a per&s;on &s;hould ri&s;e from the dead to warn &s;in|ners, coming from heaven, where they &s;ee the mi&s;ery of the damned, or from hell, where they feel it; and &s;hould tell &s;inners how di&s;mal tho&s;e torments are, &s;hould &s;et them out as well as he would be under ad|vantages to do, having &s;een or felt them, and &s;hould confirm what he &s;aid by telling that he had &s;een the &s;moke of their torments, had &s;een the raging of the flames, had &s;een the dreadful crew of devils and dam|ned &s;ouls together, and had heard their di&s;mal cries and &s;hreiks; or &s;hould &s;ay that he had felt them, and &s;hould expre&s;s by words and actions the doleful &s;tate of the damned and the extremity of their torments; &s;uch a thing as this would probably greatly fright and terrify many &s;inners, who were not terrified by reading the bible, nor by hearing preaching about hell torments. But it would be very much becau&s;e of the unu&s;ualne&s;s and &s;trangene&s;s of the thing. Men are apt to be much affected with &s;trange things, and
<PB N="97" REF="016767_0094_0F9E1F4021C23A28">
to be much affrighted by &s;pectres in the dark, becau&s;e they are unu&s;ual. But if they were as common as preaching is, they would lo&s;e their effect.</P>
<P>IT might be that on &s;uch an unu&s;ual occa&s;ion, as the ri&s;ing of one from the dead, for a while men would reform their lives, and po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome might be &s;o affected, as never to forget it. But we are to con|&s;ider, which would have the greate&s;t tendency to a|waken us, if both were alike new and unu&s;ual, to be warned of the mi&s;ery of hell by the great GOD him|&s;elf, declaring as it were from heaven, how dreadful hell is, and abundantly warning us about it; or to be warned only by a man coming from the invi&s;ible world, who had either &s;een or felt the&s;e mi&s;eries. It is in this view that we &s;hall con&s;ider the matter; and we &s;hall &s;how what advantages the former mode of warning has above the latter: or how the warnings of GOD'S word have a greater tendency to awaken &s;inners and bring them to repentance, than the ri&s;ing of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> from the dead to warn them.</P>
<P>I. GOD, in many re&s;pects, knows better what be|longs to the puni&s;hment of &s;inners than departed &s;ouls. Departed &s;ouls doubtle&s;s know what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> torments are, much better than any on earth. The &s;ouls of the wicked feel them, and the &s;ouls of the &s;aints &s;ee them afar off.

hell-torments were, by his own knowledge, and could de&s;cribe them to others, as having &s;een and felt them.</P>
<P>BUT &s;urely the all &s;eeing GOD knows as well as any of the dead, what the pre&s;ent &s;ufferings of the damned are. He is every where pre&s;ent with his all &s;eeing eye. He is in heaven and in-hell, and in and through every part of the creation. He is where every devil is, and where every damned &s;ould is; he is pre&s;ent by his knowledge and his e&s;&s;ence. He not only knows as well as tho&s;e in heaven, who &s;ee at a di&s;tance; but he knows as perfectly as tho&s;e who feel the mi&s;ery. He &s;eeth into the innermo&s;t rece&s;&s;es of the hearts of tho&s;e mi&s;erable &s;pirits. He &s;eeth all the &s;orrow and angui&s;h that are there, for he upholds them in being. They and all the powers of their &s;pirits, whereby they are capable of either happine&s;s or mi&s;ery, are in his hands.</P>
<P>BESIDES, it is his wrath that they endure: he mea|&s;ures out to them their &s;everal portions of puni&s;h|ment; he makes his wrath enter into them; he is a con&s;uming fire to them; his anger is that fire, in which they are tormented. He therefore is doubt|le&s;s able to give us as clear and di&s;tinct, and as true an account of hell, as the damned them&s;elves, if they &s;hould ri&s;e from the dead. He needs not any to in|form him.</P>
<P>HE knows far better what the eternity of tho&s;e tor|ments is, than any of them. He can better tell us how awful a thing eternity is. He knows better what the future judgment of &s;inners will be, when the LORD JESUS &s;hall come in flaming fire to take ven|geance on them that know not GOD, and obey not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> go&s;pel.

the advantage, by rea&s;on of the greatne&s;s and maje&s;ty of him, who &s;peaks. The &s;peeches and declarations of tho&s;e, who are great, excellent and honourable, have a greater tendency to move the affections, than the declarations of others, who are le&s;s excellent.

<P>BUT GOD is infinitely greater than kings; he is univer&s;al king of heaven and earth, the ab&s;olute &s;o|vereign of all things. Now what can have a greater tendency to &s;trike the mind and move the heart, than to be warned by this great and glorious being? &s;hall we be unmoved when he &s;peaks, who made heaven and earth by the word of his power; he who keeps the &s;un, moon and &s;tars in their cour&s;es? If his im|mediate &s;peeches, declarations and warnings will not influence us, what will? I&s;ai. i. 2, <Q>Hear, O hea|vens, and give ear, O earth, for the LORD hath &s;poken.</Q>&mdash;That is to the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e which we have in Mat. xxi. 37. <Q>But la&s;t of all he &s;ent his &s;on, &s;aying, They will reverence my &s;on.</Q> He &s;ent his &s;ervants before, but they did not regard them.

<P>WHAT if GOD &s;hould &s;end me&s;&s;engers from the dead to warn us, and many in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and men &s;hould reject them; we &s;hould ju&s;tly argue that it would have a much greater tendency to make men regard and obey the coun&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> if he would &s;end his &s;on or come him&s;elf.

IN the bible we not only have tho&s;e warnings, which were given by in&s;piration of the prophets; but we have GOD'S own words, which he &s;pake as it were by his own mouth. In the old te&s;tament is his voice out of the mid&s;t of the fire and the darkne&s;s, from mount Sinai. And in the new te&s;tament we have GOD &s;peaking to us, as dwelling among us. He came down from heaven and in&s;tructed us in a familiar manner, for a long while; and we have his in&s;tructi|ons recorded in our bibles.&mdash;Now which has the greate&s;t tendency to influence men, to have one of the departed &s;pirits &s;ent back into its body, to warn them; or to have GOD him&s;elf a&s;&s;ume a body, and come and warn them?</P>
<P N="4">4. IT more evidently &s;hows the importance of the affair, that GOD &s;hould immediately concern him|&s;elf in it, than the coming of one from the dead would do. Tho&s;e things about which kings mo&s;t immediately concern them&s;elves, are commonly mat|ters of the greate&s;t importance, while they leave le&s;s concernments to be managed by their officers. And &s;urely th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> mu&s;t be a matter of very great moment, in which GOD &s;hows him&s;elf &s;o much concerned, as he does in our &s;alvation.

How many arguments and expo&s;tulations hath he u&s;ed, that we might avoid the way to hell?</P>
<P>THIS evidently argues that what we are warned a|bout is a matter of the utmo&s;t concern, and proves it much more than it we were only warned by one ri&s;ing from the dead.</P>
<P N="5">5. GOD'S warning of us of our danger of damna|tion hath a greater tendency to have influence upon

us, becau&s;e he is our judge. Damnation is a puni&s;h|ment to which he condemns and which he inflicts. What he warns us of is his own wrath and vengeance. In his word we have his threatenings again&s;t &s;in de|nounced by him&s;elf. He tells us that if we go on in &s;in, he will de&s;troy us, and ca&s;t us out of his &s;ight, and pour out his wrath upon us, and hold us eternally under torment and mi&s;ery. He tells us &s;o <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> and this hath a much greater tendency to influence us, than to be told &s;o by another, who is not to be our judge, who hath not in his hands the power of mak|ing us mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>WHEN a king immediately threatens his own di&s;|plea&s;ure, it has a greater tendency to terrify men, than when another man threatens it, or warns them of the danger of it.</P>
<P N="6">6. GOD is infinitely wi&s;e and knows better how to &s;peak to us &s;o as to per&s;uade us, than one ri&s;ing from the dead.

<P>IF one &s;hould come from hell to warn &s;inners, it may be he would tell them of hell in &s;uch a manner, as would have more of a tendency to drive men into de&s;pair, and &s;et them a bla&s;pheming as they do in hell, than to excite them to &s;trive for &s;alvation, and diligently to u&s;e the means which GOD hath appoint|ed.

<P>I. IT is a natural inference from this doctrine, that if the&s;e means which GOD hath appointed, do not an&s;wer to lead men to repentance and reformati|on, no others would.&mdash;Although this be not an ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence from the words of the doctrine; yet it &s;eems to be CHRIST'S aim to teach us that if GOD'S means will not an&s;wer, none will. Our own means, tho&s;e which we can devi&s;e of our own heads, However they may &s;eem more likely at a di&s;|tance, to be effectual; yet if they be brought to the trial, will not prove to be better. The rich man thought that if his brethren were warned by one ri|&s;ing from the dead, they would &s;urely repent. But Abraham tells him, he is mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>IF one ri&s;ing from the dead would not an&s;wer the purpo&s;e, we may rationly conclude that no other kind of means, different from tho&s;e appointed by GOD, would. For what can we think of, which &s;eems, to have more of a tendency to awaken men, and lead to repentance, than one coming from the dead to them; except tho&s;e means which we enjoy.&mdash;Indeed men can think of many means, which they may imagine, if they enjoyed them, would make them believe and re|pent. But they deceive them&s;elves.</P>
<P>IT may be they think, if they could &s;ee &s;ome pro|phet, and &s;ee him work miracales, that this would
<PB N="104" REF="016767_0101_0F9E1767B186C5A0">
awaken them. But how was it in tho&s;e times in which there were prophets? There has rarely been a more degenerate time, than that in which lived Elijah and Eli&s;ha, tho&s;e great prophets of I&s;rael, who wrought &s;o many miracles. The people did not regard their prophecies nor their miracles; but walked in their own ways, and &s;erved their own gods, &s;o that Elijah thought, that there was none left of the true wor&s;hip|pers of GOD. And how did they treat the prophet Jeremiah, &s;o &s;olemnly warning them from GOD of their approaching de&s;truction! And how often do the prophets complain that all their prophecies and warnings were neglected and de&s;pi&s;ed!</P>
<P>WOULD it be &s;ufficient, if you could hear GOD &s;peak from heaven, with your bodily ears? How was it, when there were &s;uch things? How was it in Mo&s;es's time, when they heard GOD &s;peak out of the mid&s;t of the fire, and heard the voice of words ex|ceeding loud and full of maje&s;ty, &s;o that they ex|ceedingly trembled? When they &s;aw mount Sinai all covered with &s;moke, and &s;haking exceedingly? And when &s;ome of them &s;aw GOD, &s;aw the GOD of I&s;rael and did eat and drink?&mdash;How did they be have them&s;elves? Did they all of them turn from their &s;ins, and after that walk in the ways of GOD?&mdash;It is true, they were very much affected at fir&s;t, while it was a new and &s;trange thing to them; but how hard-hearted and rebellious were they &s;oon af|ter? They did not &s;cruple to rebel again&s;t this &s;ame great and glorious GOD. Yea they made a golden calf, while Mo&s;es was in the mount conver&s;ing with GOD, ju&s;t after they had &s;een tho&s;e dreadful appear|ances of divine maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>THUS they did from time to time rebel again&s;t the LORD, although they had &s;een &s;o many miracles and

wonders in Egypt, at the red &s;ea, and in the wilder|ne&s;s; although they continually &s;aw the pillar of cloud and of fire going before them, were continu|ally fed in a miraculous manner with manna; and in the &s;ame miraculous manner made to drink water out of the rock.</P>
<P>MEN are apt to think, that if they had lived in CHRIST'S time, and had &s;een and heard him, and had &s;een his miracles; that they would have effectually convinced and turned them from &s;in. But how was it in tho&s;e times? How few were there brought to repentance, by all his di&s;cour&s;es and miracles? How hard-hearted were they? Some were very much af|fected for a little while; but how few con&s;tant, &s;tea|dy followers had he! He was notwith&s;tanding his miracles, rejected, de&s;pi&s;ed and even murdered by the people, among whom he dwelt. And they were men of the &s;ame natures, of the &s;ame &s;ort of hearts, as &s;inners in the&s;e days.</P>
<P>The &s;cripture is full of in&s;tances, which are &s;uffi|cient to convince us, that if the word of GOD will not awaken and convert &s;inners, nothing will.&mdash;And we &s;ee enough in the&s;e days to convince us of it. Men &s;ometimes meet with tho&s;e things, by which we &s;hould not imagine, if we did not &s;ee it, and were not u&s;ed to it, but that they would be thoroughly awa|kened and reformed. They &s;ometimes hear the warnings of dying men, men who are expecting to go to hell. One would think, this would be enough to awaken them; and it may be they are affected with it for the pre&s;ent: but it does but ju&s;t touch them; vani&s;hes away and is gone like a puff of wind.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES &s;inners them&s;elves are laid upon beds of &s;ickne&s;s, and their lives hang in doubt before them. They are brought to the &s;ides of the grave, and to
<PB N="106" REF="016767_0103_0F9E176940C82648">
the very mouth of hell, and their hearts are full of terror and amazement. Yet if they recover they &s;oon forget it and return to the ways of folly and wickedne&s;s.&mdash;Sometimes this is repeated; they are taken &s;ick again, are again in extreme peril of death, their hearts are full of amazement, and they make ma|ny promi&s;es and vows; yet being recovered they a|gain &s;oon forget all and return to &s;in and folly. Such things are enough to convince us, that if the word of GOD be not &s;ufficient to convince men, and make them break off their &s;ins, no external means would be &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>PERHAPS &s;ome may yet be ready to think, that if &s;inners &s;hould &s;ee hell, and hear the cries of the damn|ed, that would be effectual, though nothing el&s;e would. But if we duly con&s;ider the matter, we &s;hall &s;ee rea&s;on to think, that that would not have &s;o great a tenden|cy to turn men from &s;in to GOD, as the word of GOD. Such a thing would doubtle&s;s be effectual to terrify and affright men, and probably to affright them to death.&mdash;Such a mean is not at all &s;uitable to our nature and &s;tate in the world. If it &s;hould not fright men to death, it would not have &s;o great a ten|dency to make them diligently u&s;e means for their &s;alvation, as the warnings of &s;cripture. It would probably drive them to de&s;pair; it would &s;o take a|way all their &s;pirits, that they would have no heart to &s;eek GOD. In&s;tead of driving them to GOD, it would probably make them hate GOD the more. It would make them more like devils; and &s;et them a bla&s;pheming as the damned do. For while the hearts of men are filled with natural darkne&s;s, they cannot &s;ee the glory of the divine ju&s;tice, appearing in &s;uch extreme torments.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="016767_0104_0F9E1769F02C0FD0">
THEREFORE GOD'S means, the means which he hath in&s;tituted for us, are doubtle&s;s the be&s;t, and mo&s;t conducive to lead men to repentance and &s;alvation. They are doubtle&s;s far better than any other, which we can devi&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. HENCE we learn the dreadful hardne&s;s of men's hearts, as the word of GOD hath no more in|fluence upon them, and as they are no more moved and wrought upon by tho&s;e be&s;t means, which infi|nite wi&s;dom hath provided. The warnings of the word of GOD are, as you have heard, better and more powerful means, than if one &s;hould ri&s;e from the dead to warn us, and tell us our danger, and the dreadfulne&s;s of the wrath of GOD. You have al&s;o heard that if the&s;e means will not an&s;wer the end of awakening and leading &s;inners to repentance, no other will, neither the working of miracles, nor the hear|ing of GOD &s;peak with an audible voice from heaven, nor any thing el&s;e.&mdash;Yet how few are there, who are effectually wrought upon by the word of GOD! They are very thinly &s;own; there is but here and there one.</P>
<P>WHEN we read how the children of I&s;rael con|ducted them&s;elves in the wilderne&s;s, how often they murmured and offended; we are ready to wonder at the hardne&s;s of their hearts. And when we read the hi&s;tory of CHRIST, and how the Jews halted and re|jected him notwith&s;tanding his many miracles; we are ready to wonder how they could be &s;o (doubt)hard-hearted. But we have as much rea&s;on to wonder at our&s;elves; for we have naturally the &s;ame &s;ort of hearts that they had; and &s;inners in the&s;e days mani|fe&s;t a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> hardne&s;s of heart as much to be wondered at, in that they are not influenced by the word of GOD; for they who will not hear Mo&s;es and the prophets,
<PB N="108" REF="016767_0105_0F9E176B5AD5CBF8">
JESUS CHRIST and his apo&s;tles, neither would be per&s;uaded, if one &s;hould ri&s;e from the dead, or if an angel &s;hould come from heaven.</P>
<P>THE be&s;t means of awakening and conver&s;ion are exceeding plentifully enjoyed by us, much more plen|tifully in &s;everal re&s;pects, than they were by tho&s;e who had only Mo&s;es and the prophets. In the fir&s;t place we have divine truth abundantly more fully re|vealed in the bible, than they had then. Light now &s;hines abundantly clear. Go&s;pel truth is revealed not in types and &s;hadows, but plainly. Heaven and hell are much more clearly and expre&s;ly made known. We are told that the glory of that revelation was no glory in compari&s;on with the glory of the revelation of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>AGAIN, we have a greater plenty of bibles, than they had under the di&s;pen&s;ation of Mo&s;es and the prophets. Then there was no &s;uch thing as print|ing, and bibles were &s;carce things. They &s;eldom had any bibles, any where el&s;e but in their &s;yna|gogues. But now we have them in our hou&s;es; we can look into them when we plea&s;e.&mdash;Be&s;ides, CHRIST hath appointed the go&s;pel mini&s;try, by which we have the word of GOD explained and enforced every week.&mdash;Yet how little influence hath the word of GOD to bring men to repentance!</P>
<P>LET this &s;trike conviction into tho&s;e, who never yet have found any &s;uch effect by the word of GOD Though you are convinced of nothing el&s;e, yet you have abundant rea&s;on to be convinced, that your hearts are as hard as a &s;tone, and that you are exceed|ingly &s;tupid and &s;otti&s;h.</P>
<P N="3">3. HENCE we may learn how ju&s;tly and fairly GOD deals with us. He gives us the be&s;t means of awakening and reclaiming us from our &s;ins; better
<PB N="109" REF="016767_0106_0F9E176B6E451BA8">
than if he had &s;ent one from the dead to warn us. He gives us tho&s;e means which are mo&s;t &s;uited to our nature and circum&s;tances. He gives &s;inners abun|dant warning before he puni&s;hes them. What could he have done more, than he hath done? We can devi&s;e or imagine no &s;ort of warning, which would have been better, than what GOD hath given us.&mdash;How ju&s;tly therefore are ungodly men puni&s;hed; how inexcu&s;able will they be.</P>
<P N="4">4. LET all make u&s;e of the means, which GOD hath in&s;tituted. They are the be&s;t and only means by which we may expect to obtain &s;alvation. We &s;hall be mo&s;t inexcu&s;able therefore, if we neglect them. Let us attend to the word of GOD, read and hear it carefully, con&s;ider it thoroughly, and daily walk by it. Let us be diligent in this work. The word of GOD is a great price put into our hands to get wi&s;dom and eternal &s;alvation; let us therefore improve it, while we have it, as we know not how &s;oon we may be deprived of it; le&s;t CHRIST &s;ay to us, as in Luke xix 42.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>CONCERNING the&s;e words I would ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1">1. WHO it is that is here &s;poken of, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the hypocrite; as you may &s;ee, if you take the two pre|ceeding ver&s;es with the ver&s;e of the text. <Q>For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained; when GOD taketh away his &s;oul? Will GOD hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him? Will he delight him&s;elf in the Almighty? Will he always call upon GOD?</Q> Job's three friends in their &s;peeches to him in&s;i&s;ted much upon it, that he was an hypocrite. But Job in this chapter a&s;&s;erts his &s;incerity and integrity, and &s;hows how different his own behaviour had been from that of hypocrites. Particularly he declares his &s;tedfa&s;t and immovable re&s;olution of per&s;evering and holding out in the ways of religion and righteou&s;ne&s;s to the end;

as you may &s;ee in the &s;ix fir&s;t ver&s;es.&mdash;In the text he &s;hows how contrary to this &s;tedfa&s;tne&s;s and per|&s;everance, the character of the hypocrite is, who is not wont thus to hold out in religion.</P>
<P N="2">2. WE may ob&s;erve what duty of religion it is, with re&s;pect to which the hypocrite is decyphered in the text, and that is the duty of <HI>prayer</HI> or calling up|on GOD.</P>

<P N="4">4. SOMETHING a&s;&s;erted, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that it is not the manner of hypocrites to continue <HI>always</HI> in this duty. <HI>Will be always call upon GOD?</HI> It is in the form of an interrogation; but the words have the force of a &s;trong negation, or of an a&s;&s;ertion that however the hypo|crite may call upon GOD for a &s;ea&s;on, yet he will not always continue in it.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD>DOCTRINE.</HEAD>
<P>HOWEVER hypocrites may continue for a &s;ea&s;on in the duty of prayer; yet it is their manner after a while, in a great mea&s;ure to leave it off.</P>
<P>IN &s;peaking upon this doctrine, I &s;hall &s;how,
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. HOW hypocrites often continue for a &s;ea&s;on to call upon GOD.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. HOW it is their manner, after a while, in a great mea&s;ure to leave off the practice of this duty.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. GIVE &s;ome rea&s;ons why this is the manner of hypocrites.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I. I WOULD &s;how how hypocrites often continue for a &s;ea&s;on in the duty of prayer.</P>
<P N="1">1. THEY do &s;o for a while after they have re|ceived
<PB N="113" REF="016767_0109_0F9E176E62B27A10">
common illuminations and affections. While they are under awakenings, they may through fear of hell call upon GOD, and attend very con&s;tantly upon the duty of &s;ecret prayer. And after they have had &s;ome melting affections, having their hearts much moved with the goodne&s;s of GOD, or with &s;ome af|fecting encouragements, and fal&s;e joy and comfort; while the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions la&s;t, they continue to call up|on GOD in the duty of &s;ecret prayer.</P>
<P N="2">2. AFTER they have obtained an hope, and have made profe&s;&s;ion of their good e&s;tate, they often con|tinue for a while in the duty of &s;ecret prayer. For a while they are affected with their hope: they think that GOD hath delivered them out of a natural condi|tion and given them an intere&s;t in CHRIST, thus in|troducing them into a &s;tate of &s;afety from that eter|nal mi&s;ery, which they lately feared. With this &s;up|po&s;ed kindne&s;s of GOD to them, they are much af|fected, and often find in them&s;elves, for a while, a kind of love to GOD, excited by his &s;uppo&s;ed love to them. Now while this affection towards GOD con|tinues, the duties of religion &s;eem plea&s;ant to them; it is even with &s;ome delight that they approach to GOD in their clo&s;ets; and for the pre&s;ent, it may be, they think of no other than continuing to call upon GOD, as long as they live.</P>
<P>YEA they may continue in the duty of &s;ecret pray|er for a while after the liveline&s;s of their affections is pa&s;t; partly through the influence of their former in|tentions: They intended to continue &s;eeking GOD al|ways; and now &s;uddenly to leave off, would there|fore be too &s;hocking to their own minds. And part|ly through the force of their own preconceived no|tions, and what they have always believed, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that godly per&s;ons do continue in religion, and that their goodne&s;s is not like the morning cloud. There|fore,
<PB N="114" REF="016767_0110_0F9E17722A7C3498">
though they have no love to the duty of pray|er and begin to grow weary of it; yet as they love their own hope, they are &s;ome-what backward to take a cour&s;e, which will prove it to be a fal&s;e hope, and &s;o deprive them of it.</P>
<P>IF they &s;hould at once carry them&s;elves &s;o as they have always been taught is a &s;ign of a fal&s;e hope, they would &s;care them&s;elves. Their hope is dear to them, and it would &s;care them to &s;ee any plain evidence that it is not true. Hence, for a con&s;iderable time after the force of their illuminations and affections is over, and after they hate the duty of prayer, and would be glad to have done with it, if they could, without &s;howing them&s;elves to be hypocrites; they hold up a kind of attendance upon the duty of &s;ecret prayer.&mdash;This may keep up the out&s;ide of religion in them for a good while, and occa&s;ion it to be &s;ome what &s;lowly, that they are brought to neglect it. They mu&s;t not leave off &s;uddenly, becau&s;e that would be too great a &s;hock to their fal&s;e peace. But they mu&s;t come gradually to it, as they find their con&s;ci|ences can bear it, and as they can find out devices and &s;alvo's to cover over the matter, and make their &s;o doing con&s;i&s;tent, in their own opinion, with the truth of their hope. But</P>
<P>II. IT is the manner of hypocrites after a while in a great mea&s;ure to leave off the practice of this du|ty. We are often taught that the &s;eeming goodne&s;s and piety of hypocrites is not of a la&s;ting and per&s;e|vering nature. It is &s;o with re&s;pect to their practice of the duty of prayer in particular, and e&s;pecially of &s;ecret prayer. They can omit this duty, and their omi&s;&s;ion of it not be taken notice of by others, who know what profe&s;&s;ion they have made. So that regard to their own reputation doth not oblige then &s;till to practi&s;e it. If others &s;aw how they neglect it
<PB N="115" REF="016767_0111_0F9E1773440C54C8">
it would exceedingly &s;hock their charity towards them. But their neglect doth not fall under their ob|&s;ervation; at lea&s;t not under the ob&s;ervation of ma|ny. Therefore they may omit this duty, and &s;till have the credit of being converted per&s;ons.</P>
<P>MEN of this character can come to a neglect of &s;e|cret prayer by degrees without very much &s;hocking their peace. For though indeed for a converted per|&s;on to live in a great mea&s;ure without &s;ecret prayer, is very wide of the notion they once had of a true convert; yet they find means by degrees to alter their notions, and to bring their principles to &s;uit with their inclinations; and at length they come to that, in their notions of things, that a man may be a con|vert, and yet live very much in neglect of this duty. In time they can bring all things to &s;uit well together, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n hope of heaven, and an indulgence of &s;loth in gratifying carnal appetites, and living in a great mea|&s;ure a prayerle&s;s life. They cannot indeed &s;uddenly make the&s;e things agree; it mu&s;t be a work of time; and length of time will effect it. By degrees they find out ways to guard and defend their con&s;ciences again&s;t tho&s;e powerful enemies; &s;o that tho&s;e ene|mies and a quiet, &s;ecure con&s;cience, can at length dwell prety well together.</P>
<P>WHEREAS it is a&s;&s;erted in the doctrine, that it is the manner of hypocrites, after a while, in a great mea|&s;ure to leave off this duty; I would ob&s;erve to you,</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT it is not intended but that they may commonly continue to the end of life in yielding an external attendance on open prayer, or prayer with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">hers. They may commonly be pre&s;ent at publick <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in the congregation, and al&s;o at family-pray|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">. This, in &s;uch places of light as this is, men <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> do, before ever they are &s;o much as awa|kened.
<PB N="116" REF="016767_0112_0F9E177501479F18">
Many vicious per&s;ons, who make no pre|tence to &s;erious religion, commonly attend pub|lick prayers in the congregation, and al&s;o more pri|vate prayers in the families in which they live, un|le&s;s it be when carnal de&s;igns interfere, or when their youthful plea&s;ures and diver&s;ions, and their vain company call them: and then they make no con&s;ci|ence of attending family-prayer. Otherwi&s;e they may continue to attend upon prayer as long as they live, and yet may truly be &s;aid not to call upon GOD. For &s;uch prayer in the manner of it, is not their own. They are pre&s;ent only for the &s;ake of their credit, or in compliance with others. They may be pre&s;ent at the&s;e prayers and yet have no proper prayer of their own. Many of tho&s;e concerning whom it may be &s;aid, as in Job. xv. 4. That <HI>they ca&s;t off fear and re|&s;train prayer before GOD,</HI> are yet frequently pre&s;ent at family and publick prayers.</P>
<P N="2">2. BUT they in a great mea&s;ure leave off the prac|tice of <HI>&s;ecret</HI> prayer. They come to this pa&s;s, by degrees. At fir&s;t they begin to be carele&s;s about it, under &s;ome particular temptations. Becau&s;e they have been out in young company, or have been taken up very much with worldly bu&s;ine&s;s, they omit it once: after that they more ea&s;ily omit it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">again. Thus it pre&s;ently becomes a frequent thing with them to omit it; and after a while it comes to that pa&s;s, that they &s;eldom attend it. Perhaps they attend it on &s;abbath days, and &s;ometimes on other days. But they have cea&s;ed to make it a con&s;tant practice, daily to retire to wor&s;hip GOD alone, and to &s;eek his face in &s;ecret places. They &s;ometimes do a little to quiet con&s;cience, and ju&s;t to keep alive their old hope; be|cau&s;e it would be &s;hocking to them, even after all their &s;ubtil dealing with their con&s;ciences, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="117" REF="016767_0113_0F9E177525A59E78">
them&s;elves converts, and yet totally to live without prayer. Yet the practice of &s;ecret prayer they have in a great mea&s;ure left off.&mdash;I come now</P>
<P>III. TO the rea&s;ons, why this is the manner of hypocrites.</P>
<P N="1">1. HYPOCRITES never had the &s;pirit of prayer gi|ven them. They may have been &s;tirred up to the ex|ternal performance of this duty, and that with a great deal of earne&s;tne&s;s and affection, and yet always have been de&s;titute of the true &s;pirit of prayer. The &s;pi|rit of prayer is an holy &s;pirit, a gracious &s;pirit. We read of the &s;pirit of grace and &s;upplication; Zech. xii. 10. I will pour out on the hou&s;e of David and the inhabitants of Jeru&s;alem, the <HI>&s;pirit of grace and &s;upplications.</HI>&mdash;Wherever there is a true &s;pirit of &s;upplication, there is the &s;pirit of grace. The true &s;pirit of prayer is no other than GOD'S own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> dwel|ling in the hearts of the &s;aints. And as this &s;pirit comes from GOD, &s;o doth it naturally tend to GOD in holy breathings and pantings. It naturally leads to GOD, to conver&s;e with him by prayer. Therefore the &s;pirit is &s;aid to make interce&s;&s;ion for the &s;aints, with groanings which cannot be uttered. Rom. viii. 26.</P>
<P>THE &s;pirit of GOD makes interce&s;&s;ion for them, as it is that &s;pirit which in &s;ome re&s;pect indites their prayers, and leads them &s;o and &s;o to pour out their &s;ouls before GOD. Therefore the &s;aints are &s;aid to wor&s;hip GOD in the <HI>&s;pirit;</HI> Phil. iii. 3. We are the circumci&s;ion who wor&s;hip GOD in the &s;pirit. And Joh. iv. 23. The true wor&s;hippers wor&s;hip the fa|ther in &s;pirit and in truth. The truly godly have the &s;pirit of adoption, the &s;pirit of a child, to which it is natural to go to GOD and call upon him, crying to him as to a father.</P>
<P>BUT hypocrites have nothing of this &s;pirit of adop|tion:
<PB N="118" REF="016767_0114_0F9E1775E5436DC0">
They have not the &s;pirit of children; for this is a gracious and holy &s;pirit, only given in a real work of regeneration. Therefore it is often menti|oned as a part of the di&s;tingui&s;hing character of the godly, that they call upon GOD. P&s;al. cxlv. 18, 19. The LORD is nigh to them that call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth. He will fulfil the de|&s;ire of them that fear him; he will al&s;o hear their cry; and will &s;ave them. Joel ii. 32. It &s;hall come to pa&s;s that who&s;oever calleth on the name of the LORD &s;hall be delivered.</P>
<P>IT is natural to one who is truly born from above to pray to GOD, and to pour out his &s;oul in holy &s;upplications before his heavenly father. This is as natural to the new nature and life as breathing is to the nature and life of the body. But hypocrites have not this new nature. Tho&s;e illuminations and affec|tions which they had, went away and left no change of nature. Therefore prayer naturally dies away in them, having no foundation for the keeping of it up, laid in the nature of the &s;oul. It is maintained, while it is maintained, only by a certain force put upon na|ture But force is not con&s;tant; and as that declines, nature will take place again.</P>
<P>THE &s;pirit of a true convert is a &s;pirit of true love to GOD, and that naturally inclines the &s;oul to tho&s;e duties wherein it is conver&s;ant with GOD, and makes it to delight in approaching to GOD. But an hypo|crite hath no &s;uch &s;pirit. He is left under the reign|ing power of enmity again&s;t GOD, which naturally in|clines him to &s;hun the pre&s;ence of GOD.</P>
<P>THE &s;pirit of a true convert is a &s;pirit of faith and reliance on the power, wi&s;dom and mercy of GOD, and &s;uch a &s;pirit is naturally expre&s;&s;ed in prayer. True prayer is nothing el&s;e but faith expre&s;&s;ed. Hence
<PB N="119" REF="016767_0115_0F9E1776B4B92970">
we read of <HI>the prayer of faith;</HI> James v. 15. True Chri&s;tian prayer is the faith and reliance of the &s;oul breathed forth in words. But an hypocrite is without the &s;pirit of faith. He hath no true reliance or de|pendence on God, but is really &s;elf-dependent.</P>
<P>AS to tho&s;e common convictions and affections, which the hypocrite had, and which made him keep up the duty of prayer for a while; they not reaching the bottom of the heart, nor being accompanied with any change of nature, a little thing extingui&s;hes them. The cares of the world commonly choke and &s;uffocate them, and often the plea&s;ures and vani|ties of youth totally put an end to them, and with them ends their con&s;tant practice of the duty of prayer.</P>
<P N="2">2. WHEN an hypocrite hath had his fal&s;e con|ver&s;ion, his wants are in his &s;en&s;e of things already &s;upplied, his de&s;ires are already an&s;wered; and &s;o he finds no further bu&s;ine&s;s at the throne of grace. He never was &s;en&s;ible that he had any other needs, but a need of being &s;afe from hell. And now that he is converted, as he thinks, that need is &s;upplied. Why then &s;hould he &s;till go on to re&s;ort to the throne of grace with earne&s;t reque&s;ts? He is out of danger: all that he was afraid of is removed: he hath got enough to carry him to heaven, and what more &s;hould he de&s;ire?&mdash;While he was under awakenings he had this to &s;tir him up to go to GOD in prayer, that he was in continual fear of hell. This put him up|on crying to GOD for mercy. But &s;ince in his own opinion he is converted, he hath no further bu&s;ine&s;s about which to go to GOD. And although he may keep up the duty of prayer in the outward form a little while, for fear of &s;poiling his hope; yet he will find a dull bu&s;ine&s;s of continuing it without any need <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> nece&s;&s;ity, and &s;o by degrees he will let drop the
<PB N="120" REF="016767_0116_0F9E1777638064E8">
practice. The work of the hypocrite is done, when he is converted; and therefore he &s;tandeth in no fur|ther need of help.</P>
<P>BUT it is far otherwi&s;e with the true convert. His work is not done; but he finds &s;till a great work to do, and great wants to be &s;upplied. He &s;ees him|&s;elf &s;till to be a poor, empty helple&s;s creature, and that he &s;till &s;tands in great and continual need of GOD'S help. He is &s;en&s;ible that without GOD he can do nothing. A fal&s;e conver&s;ion makes a man in his own eyes &s;elf-&s;ufficient. He faith he is rich and in|crea&s;ed with goods and hath need of nothing; and knoweth not that he is wretched, and mi&s;erable, and poor, and blind, and naked. But after a true con|ver&s;ion, the &s;oul remains &s;en&s;ible of it's own impo|tence and emptine&s;s, as it is in it&s;elf, and it's &s;en&s;e of it is rather increa&s;ed than dimini&s;hed. It is &s;till &s;en|&s;ible of it's univer&s;al dependence on GOD for every thing. A true convert is &s;en&s;ible that his grace is very imperfect; and he is very far from having all that he de&s;ires. In&s;tead of that, by conver&s;ion are begotten in him new de&s;ires, which he never had be|fore. He now finds in him holy appetites, an hun|gering and thir&s;ting after righteou&s;ne&s;s, a longing af|ter more acquaintance and communion with GOD, So that he hath bu&s;ine&s;s enough &s;till at the throne of grace; yea his bu&s;ine&s;s there, in&s;tead of being dimi|ni&s;hed, is &s;ince his conver&s;ion rather increa&s;ed.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE hope which the hypocrite hath of his good e&s;tate, takes off the force that the command of GOD before had upon his con&s;cience; &s;o that now he dares neglect &s;o plain a duty. The command which requires the practice of the duty of prayer is exceed|ing plain; Mat. xxvi. 41. Watch and p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">y, that ye enter not into temptation, Eph. vi. 18. Pray|ing
<PB N="121" REF="016767_0117_0F9E177847F3ACD0">
always with all prayer and &s;upplication in the &s;pirit, and watching thereunto with <HI>all per&s;everance,</HI> and &s;upplication for all &s;aints. Mat. vi. 6. When thou praye&s;t enter into thy clo&s;et, and when thou ha&s;t &s;hut thy door, pray to thy father which is in &s;ecret. As long as the hypocrite was in his own apprehen&s;i|on in continual danger of hell, he dur&s;t not di&s;obey the&s;e commands. But &s;ince he is, as he thinks, &s;afe from hell, he is grown bold, he dares to live in the neglect of the plaine&s;t command in the bible.</P>
<P N="4">4. IT is the manner of hypocrites after a while to return to &s;inful practices, which will tend to keep them from praying. While they were under con|victions, they reformed their lives, and walked very exactly. This reformation continues for a little time perhaps, after their &s;uppo&s;ed conver&s;ion, while they are much affected with hope and fal&s;e comfort. But as the&s;e things die away, their old lu&s;ts revive, and they by degrees return like the dog to his vomit, and the &s;ow that was wa&s;hed to her wallowing in the mire. They return to their &s;en&s;ual practices, to their worldly practices, to their proud and contentious practices, as before. And no wonder this makes them for&s;ake their clo&s;ets. Sinning and praying a|gree not well together. If a man be con&s;tant in the duty of &s;ecret prayer, it will tend to re&s;train him from wilful &s;inning. So on the other hand, if he allow him&s;elf in &s;inful practices, it will re&s;train him from praying. It will give quite another turn to his mind, &s;o that he will have no di&s;po&s;ition to the prac|tice of &s;uch a duty: it will be contrary to him. A man who knows, that he lives in &s;in again&s;t GOD, will not be inclined to come daily into the pre&s;ence of GOD; but will rather be inclined to fly from his pre&s;ence, as Adam, when he had eaten of the forbid|den
<PB N="122" REF="016767_0118_0F9E177C613DA0D8">
fruit, ran away from GOD, and hid him&s;elf among the trees of the garden.</P>
<P>TO keep up the duty of prayer, after he hath gi|ven loo&s;e to his lu&s;ts, would tend very much to di&s;|quiet a man's con&s;cience. It would give advantage to his con&s;cience to te&s;tify aloud again&s;t him. If he &s;hould come from his wickedne&s;s into the pre&s;ence of GOD, immediately to &s;peak to him, his con&s;cience would, as it were, fly in his face. Therefore hypo|crites, as they by degrees admit their wicked practi|ces, exclude payer.</P>
<P N="5">5. HYPOCRITES never counted the co&s;t of per&s;e|verance in &s;eeking GOD and of following him to the end of life. To continue in&s;tant in prayer with all per&s;everance to the end of life, requires much care, watchfulne&s;s and labour. For much oppo&s;ition is made to it, by the fle&s;h, the world and the devil; and <HI>chri&s;tians</HI> meet with many temptations to for&s;ake this practice. He that would per&s;evere in this duty, mu&s;t be laborious in religion in general. But hypo|crites never count the co&s;t of &s;uch labour; i. e. they never were prepared in the di&s;po&s;ition of their minds to give their lives to the &s;ervice of GOD, and to the duties of religion. It is therefore no great wonder they are weary and give out, after they have continu|ed for a while, as their affections are gone, and they find that prayer to them grows irk&s;ome and tedious.</P>
<P N="6">6. HYPOCRITES have no intere&s;t in tho&s;e graci|ous promi&s;es, which GOD hath made to his people, of tho&s;e &s;piritual &s;upplies, which are needful in or|der to uphold them in the way of their duty to the end. GOD hath promi&s;ed to true &s;aints, that they &s;hall not for&s;ake him. Jer. xxxii. 40. I will put my fear into their hearts, that they &s;hall not depart from me. He hath promi&s;ed that he will keep them
<PB N="123" REF="016767_0119_0F9E177EF1D5D7D0">

<P>I. I WOULD exhort tho&s;e who have entertained an hope of their being true converts, and yet &s;ince their &s;up|po&s;ed conver&s;ion have left off the duty of &s;ecret pray|er, and do ordinarily allow them&s;elves in the omi&s;&s;ion of it, to throw away their hope. If you have left off calling upon GOD, it is time for you to leave off hop|ing, and flattering your&s;elves with an imagination that you are the children of GOD. Probably it will be a very difficult thing for you to do this. It is hard for a man to let go an hope of heaven, on which he hath once allowed him&s;elf to lay hold, and which he hath retained for a con&s;iderable time. True con|ver&s;ion is a rare thing; but that men are brought off from a fal&s;e hope of conver&s;ion, after they are once &s;ettled and e&s;tabli&s;hed in it, and have continued in it for &s;ome time; is much more rare.</P>
<P>THOSE things in men, which, if they were known to others, would be &s;ufficient to convince others that they are hypocrites, will not convince them&s;elves, and tho&s;e things which would be &s;ufficient to con|vince

They can make larger allowances for them&s;elves than they can for others. They can find out ways to &s;olve objections again&s;t their own hope, when they can find none in the like ca&s;e for their neighbour.</P>
<P>BUT if your ca&s;e be &s;uch as is &s;poken of in the doctrine, it is &s;urely time for you to &s;eek a better hope and another work of GOD'S &s;pirit, than ever you have yet experienced; &s;omething more thorough and ef|fectual. When you &s;ee and find by experience that the &s;eed which was &s;own in your hearts, though at fir&s;t it &s;prang up and &s;eemed flouri&s;hing, yet is wither|ing away, as by the heat of the &s;un, or is choaked, as with thorns; this &s;hows in what &s;ort of ground the &s;eed was &s;own, that it is either &s;tony or thorny ground; and that therefore it is nece&s;&s;ary you &s;hould pa&s;s through another change, whereby your heart may become good ground, which &s;hall bring forth fruit with patience.</P>
<P>INSIST not on that as a rea&s;on why you &s;hould not throw away your hope, that you had the judgment of others that the change of which you were the &s;ub|ject was right. It is a &s;mall matter to be judged of man's judgment, whether you be approved or con|demned, and whether it be by mini&s;ter or people, wi&s;e or unwi&s;e. I. Cor. iv. 3. <Q>It is a very &s;mall thing that I &s;hould be judged of you or of man's judgment.</Q> If your goodne&s;s have proved to be as the morning cloud and early dew; if you be one of tho&s;e, who have for&s;aken GOD and left off calling upon his name; you have the judgment of GOD, and the &s;entence of GOD in the &s;criptures again&s;t you, which is a thou&s;and times more than to have the

judgment of all the wi&s;e and godly men and mini&s;ters in the world in your favour.</P>
<P>OTHERS, from your account of things, may have been obliged to have charity for you, and to think that, provided you were not mi&s;taken, and in your account did not mi&s;repre&s;ent things, or expre&s;s them by wrong terms, you were really converted. But what a mi&s;erable foundation is this, upon which to build an hope as to your eternal &s;tate!</P>
<P>HERE I reque&s;t your attention to a few things in particular, which I have to &s;ay to you concerning your hope.</P>
<P>I. WHY will you retain that hope, which by evi|dent experience you find poi&s;ons you? Is it rea&s;ona|ble to think, that an holy hope, an hope that is from heaven, would have &s;uch an influence? No &s;urely, nothing of &s;uch a malignent influence comes from that world of purity and glory. No poi&s;on groweth in the paradi&s;e of GOD. The &s;ame hope, which leads men to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">n <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n this world, will lead to hell hereafter. Why therefore will you retain &s;uch an hope, of which your own experience &s;hows you the ill tendency, in that it encourages you to lead a wicked life? For cer|tainly that life is a wicked life, wherein you live in the neglect of &s;o well known a duty, as that of &s;ecret prayer, and in the di&s;obedience of &s;o plain a com|mand of GOD, as that by which this duty is enjoined. And is not a way of di&s;obedience to GOD, a way to hell?</P>
<P>IF your own experience of the nature and tenden|cy of your hope, will not convince you of the fal&s;e|ne&s;s of it, what will? Are you re&s;olved to retain your hope, let it prove ever &s;o un&s;ound and hurtful? Will you hold it fa&s;t, till you go to hell with it? Many men cling to a fal&s;e hope and embrace it &s;o clo&s;ely
<PB N="126" REF="016767_0122_0F9E1782A6418888">
that they never let it go, till the flames of hell cau&s;e their arms to unclinch and let go their hold.&mdash;Con|&s;ider how you will an&s;wer it at the day of judgment, when GOD &s;hall call you to an account for your folly in re&s;ting in &s;uch an hope. Will it be a &s;ufficient an&s;wer for you to &s;ay, that you had the charity of others, and that they thought your conver&s;ion was right?</P>
<P>CERTAINLY it is fooli&s;h for men to imagine, that GOD had no more wi&s;dom, or could contrive no other way of be&s;towing comfort and hope of eternal life, than one which &s;hould encourage men to for&s;ake him.</P>

<P>HOWEVER hypocrites may continue for a &s;ea|&s;on in the duty of prayer, yet it is their man|ner after a while, in a great mea&s;ure to leave it off.</P>
<P>THIS doctrine was our &s;ubject in the preceeding di&s;cour&s;e, in which, after having &s;hown&mdash;how hypo|crites often continue for a &s;ea&s;on to call upon GOD&mdash;how it is their manner after a while, in a great mea&s;ure, to leave it off&mdash;and having given the rea|&s;ons why this is their manner; I came at length to make <HI>application,</HI> which I propo&s;ed to do in an u&s;e of <HI>exhortation</HI> in two branches; and fir&s;t to exhort tho&s;e who entertain an hope of their good e&s;tate and yet live in the neglect of &s;ecret prayer, to reject their hope.

2. HOW is your doing, as you do, con&s;i&s;tent with loving GOD above all. If you have not a &s;pirit to love GOD above your deare&s;t earthly friends, and your mo&s;t plea&s;ant earthly enjoyments; the &s;crip|tures are very plain and full in it, that you are not true chri&s;tians. But if you had indeed &s;uch a &s;pirit, would you thus grow weary of the practice of draw|ing near to him, and become habitually &s;o aver&s;e to it, as in a great mea&s;ure to ca&s;t off &s;o plain a duty, which is &s;o much the life of a child of GOD? It is the nature of love to be aver&s;e to ab&s;ence, and to love a near acce&s;s to tho&s;e whom we love. We love to be with them; we delight to come often to them, and to have much conver&s;ation with them. But when a per&s;on, who hath heretofore been wont to conver&s;e freely with another, by degrees for&s;akes him, grows &s;trange, and conver&s;es with him but little, and that although the other be importunate with him for the continuance of their former intimacy; this plainly &s;hows the coldne&s;s of his heart towards him.</P>
<P>THE neglect of the duty of prayer &s;eems to be in|con&s;i&s;tent with &s;upreme love to GOD al&s;o upon ano|ther account, and that is that it is again&s;t the will of GOD &s;o plainly revealed. True love to GOD &s;eeks to plea&s;e GOD in every thing, and univer&s;ally to conform to his will.</P>
<P>3. YOUR thus re&s;training prayer before GOD is not only incon&s;i&s;tent with the love, but al&s;o with the fear of GOD. It is an argument that you ca&s;t off fear, as is manife&s;t by that text, Job. xv. 4. <HI>Yea thou ca&s;te&s;t off fear and re&s;traine&s;t prayer before God.</HI> While you thus live in the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of &s;o plain a command of GOD, you evidently &s;how, that there is no fear of GOD before your eyes.

<P><PB N="129" REF="016767_0125_0F9E1784E86AA248">
4. CONSIDER how living in &s;uch a neglect is con|&s;i&s;tent with leading an holy life. We are abundant|ly in&s;tructed in &s;cripture, that true chri&s;tians do lead an holy life; that without holine&s;s no man &s;hall &s;ee the LORD, Heb. xii. 14. And that every one that hath this hope in him, purifyeth him&s;elf, even as CHRIST is pure I Joh. iii. 3.&mdash;In Prov. xvi. 17. It is &s;aid, The <HI>high way</HI> of the upright is to depart from evil; i. e. it is, as it were, the common beaten road, in which all the godly travel.&mdash;To the like purpo&s;e is I&s;ai. xxxv. 8. A <HI>high way</HI> &s;hall be there, and a way, and it &s;hall be called the <HI>way of holine&s;s;</HI> the unclean &s;hall not pa&s;s over it, but it &s;hall be for <HI>tho&s;e;</HI> i. e. tho&s;e redeemed per&s;ons &s;poken of in the foregoing ver&s;es.&mdash;It is &s;poken of in Rom. Viii, 1. as the character of all believers, that they walk not after the fle&s;h, but after the &s;pirit.</P>
<P>BUT how is a life in a great mea&s;ure prayerle&s;s, con|&s;i&s;tent with an holy life? To lead an holy life is to lead a life devoted to GOD; a life of wor&s;hipping and &s;erving GOD; a life con&s;ecrated to the &s;ervice of GOD. But how doth he lead &s;uch a life, who doth not &s;o much as maintain the duty of prayer? How can &s;uch a man be &s;aid to walk by the &s;pirit, and to be a &s;ervant of the mo&s;t high GOD.&mdash;An holy life is a life of faith. The life that true Chri&s;tians live in the world, they live by the faith of the &s;on of GOD. But who can believe that that man lives by faith, who lives without prayer which is the natural expre&s;&s;ion of faith? Prayer is as natural an expre&s;&s;ion of faith, as breathing is of life; and to &s;ay a man lives a life of faith, and yet lives a prayerle&s;s life, is every whit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> incon&s;i&s;tent and incredible, as to &s;ay that a man lives without breathing. A prayerle&s;s life is &s;o far from being an holy life that it is a profane life: he
<PB N="130" REF="016767_0126_0F9E1785EC306890">
that lives &s;o, lives like an heathen, who calleth not on GOD'S name: he that lives a prayerle&s;s life, lives without GOD in the world.</P>
<P>5. IF you live in the neglect of &s;ecret prayer, you &s;how your goodwill to neglect all the wor&s;hip of GOD. He that prays only when he prays with o|thers, would not pray at all, were it not, that the eyes of others are upon him. He that will not pray where none but GOD &s;eeth him, manife&s;tly doth not pray at all out of re&s;pect to GOD, or regard to his all &s;eeing eye, and therefore doth in effect ca&s;t off all prayer. And he that ca&s;ts off prayer, in effect ca&s;ts off all the wor&s;hip of GOD, of which prayer is the principal du|ty. Now what a mi&s;erable &s;aint is he, who is no wor&s;hipper of GOD! He that ca&s;ts off the wor&s;hip of GOD, in effect ca&s;ts off GOD him&s;elf: he refu&s;es to own him, or to be conver&s;ant with him as his God. For the way in which men own GOD and are conver|&s;ant with him as their GOD, is by wor&s;hipping him.</P>
<P>6. How can you expect to dwell with GOD fore|ver if you &s;o neglect and for&s;ake him here? This your practice &s;hows, that you place not your happi|ne&s;s in GOD, in nearne&s;s to him, and communion with him. He who refu&s;es to come and vi&s;it, and con|ver&s;e with a friend, and who in a great mea&s;ure for&s;ake him, when he is abundantly invited and importuned to come; plainly &s;hows that he places not his happi|ne&s;s in the company and conver&s;ation of that friend. Now if this be the ca&s;e with you re&s;pecting GOD, then how can you expect to have it for your happi|ne&s;s to all eternity, to be with GOD, and to enjoy holy communion with him?</P>
<P>LET tho&s;e per&s;ons who hope they are converted, and yet have in a great mea&s;ure left off the duty of &s;ecret prayer, and who&s;e manner it is ordinarily to neglect it, for their own &s;ake &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider the&s;e
<PB N="131" REF="016767_0127_0F9E178689924588">
things. For what will profit them to plea&s;e them|&s;elves with <HI>that,</HI> while they live, which will fail them at la&s;t, and leave them in fearful and amazing di&s;ap|pointment?</P>
<P>IT is probable that &s;ome of you, who have enter|tained a good opinion of your &s;tate, and have looked upon your&s;elves as converts; but have of late in a great mea&s;ure left off the duty of &s;ecret prayer; will this evening attend &s;ecret prayer; and &s;o may conti|nue to do, for a little while after your hearing this &s;ermon, to the end, that you may &s;olve the difficulty and the objection which is made again&s;t the truth of your hope. But this will not hold. As it hath been in former in&s;tances of the like nature, &s;o what you now hear, will have &s;uch effect upon you, but a lit|tle while. When the bu&s;ine&s;s and cares of the world &s;hall again begin to crowd a little upon you, or the next time you &s;hall go out into young company, it is probable you will again neglect this duty. The next time a <HI>frolick</HI> &s;hall be appointed, to which it is pro|po&s;ed to you to go, it is highly probable you will neglect not only &s;ecret prayer, but al&s;o family-pray|er. Or at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ea&s;t, after a while you will come to the &s;ame pa&s;s again, as before, in ca&s;ting off fear and re|ffraining prayer before GOD.</P>
<P>IT is not very likely that you will ever <HI>be con&s;tant and per&s;evering in this duty, until you</HI> &s;hall have obtain|ed a better principle in your hearts, until you &s;hall have pa&s;&s;ed an othergui&s;e change than ever you have yet pa&s;&s;ed. The &s;treams which have no &s;prings to feed them, will dry up. The drought and heat con&s;ume the &s;now-waters. Although they run plen|tifully in the &s;pring, yet when the &s;un a&s;cends high|er with a burning heat, they are gone. The &s;eed that is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">own in &s;tony places, though it &s;eem to flouri&s;h at

pre&s;ent, yet as the &s;un &s;hall ri&s;e with a burning heat, will wither away. None will bring forth fruit with patience, but tho&s;e who&s;e hearts are become good ground.</P>
<P>WITHOUT any heavenly &s;eed remaining in them, men may, whenever they fall in among the godly, continue all their lives to talk like &s;aints. They may for their credit &s;ake tell of what they have expe|rienced, but their <HI>deeds</HI> will not hold. They may continue to tell of their inward experiences, and yet live in the neglect of &s;ecret prayer and of other duties.</P>
<P>II. I WOULD take occa&s;ion from this doctrine to exhort all to per&s;evere in the duty of prayer. This exhortation is much in&s;i&s;ted on in the word of GOD. It is in&s;i&s;ted on in the old te&s;tament. 1 Chron. xvi. 11. <Q>Seek the LORD and his &s;trength, &s;eek his face <HI>continually.</HI></Q> I&s;ai. lxii. 7. <Q>Ye that make menti|on of the LORD, keep not &s;ilence;</Q> i. e. be not &s;ilent as to the voice of prayer, as is manife&s;t by the following words, <Q>and give him no re&s;t, till he e&s;ta|bli&s;h and till he make Jeru&s;alem a prai&s;e in the earth.</Q> I&s;rael of old is reproved for growing wea|ry of the duty of prayer. I&s;ai. xliii. 22. <Q>But thou ha&s;t not called upon me, O Jacob, thou ha&s;t been weary of me, O I&s;rael.</Q></P>
<P>PERSEVERANCE in the duty of prayer is very much in&s;i&s;ted on in the new te&s;tament; as Luke xviii. at the beginning, <Q>a man ought always to pray and not to faint;</Q> i. e. not to be di&s;couraged or wea|ry of the duty; but &s;hould always continue in it. Again Luke xxi. 36. Watch ye therefore and pray <HI>always.</HI> We have the example of Anna the pro|phete&s;s &s;et before us Luke i. 36 &amp;c. Who though &s;he had lived to be more than an hundred years old,
<PB N="133" REF="016767_0129_0F9E1787E35092B8">
yet never was weary of this duty. It is &s;aid, <Q>She departed not from the temple, but &s;erved GOD with fa&s;tings and prayers night and day.</Q> Corne|lius al&s;o is commended for his con&s;tancy in this duty. It is &s;aid that he prayed to GOD always; Acts x. 2. The apo&s;tle Paul in his epi&s;tles in&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ts very much on con&s;tancy in this duty. Rom. xii. 12. <Q>Continu|ing in&s;tant in prayer.</Q>&mdash;Eph. vi. 18, 19. <Q>Pray|ing always with all prayer and &s;upplication in the &s;pirit and watching thereunto with all per&s;eve|rance.</Q> Col. iv. 2. <Q>Continue in prayer and watch in the &s;ame.</Q> 1 The&s;s. v. 17. <Q>Pray without cea&s;ing.</Q> To the &s;ame effect the apo&s;tle Peter; 1 Pet. iv. 7. "Watch unto prayer."&mdash;Thus abundantly the &s;criptures in&s;i&s;t upon it, that we &s;hould per&s;evere in the duty of prayer; which &s;hows that it is of very great importance, that we &s;hould per&s;evere. If the contrary be the manner of hypocrites, as hath been &s;hown in the doctrine, then &s;urely we ought to beware of this leaven.</P>
<P>BUT here let the following things be particularly con&s;idered as motives to per&s;everance in this duty.</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT per&s;everance in the way of duty is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation, and is abundantly declared &s;o to be in the holy &s;criptures; as I&s;ai. lxiv. 5. <Q>Thou meete&s;t him that rejoiceth and worketh righteou&s;|ne&s;s, tho&s;e that remember thee in thy ways: be|hold, thou art wroth, for we have &s;inned: in tho&s;e is <HI>continuance</HI> and we &s;hall be &s;aved.</Q> Heb. x. 38 and 39. <Q>Now the ju&s;t &s;hall live by faith: but if any man <HI>draw back,</HI> my &s;oul hath no plea&s;ure in him. But we are not of them who <HI>draw back unto perdition;</HI> but of them that believe to the &s;av|ing of the &s;oul.</Q> Rom. xi 22. <Q>Behold there|fore the goodne&s;s and &s;everity of GOD: on the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">
<PB N="134" REF="016767_0130_0F9E178B5746ADE0">
which fell, &s;everity; but towards thee, goodne&s;s, if thou <HI>continue</HI> in his goodne&s;s; <HI>otherwi&s;e</HI> thou al|&s;o &s;halt be cut off.</Q> So in many other places.</P>
<P>MANY, when they think they are converted, &s;eem to imagine that their work is done, and that there is nothing el&s;e needful in order to their going to hea|ven.&mdash;Indeed per&s;everance in holine&s;s of life is not nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation, as the righteou&s;ne&s;s by which a right to &s;alvation is obtained. Nor is actual per&s;everance nece&s;&s;ary in order to our becoming in|tere&s;ted in that righteou&s;ne&s;s by which we are ju&s;tifi|ed. For as &s;oon as ever a &s;oul hath believed in CHRIST, or hath put forth one act of faith in him, it becomes intere&s;ted in his righteou&s;ne&s;s, and in all the promi&s;es purcha&s;ed by it.</P>
<P>BUT per&s;evering in the way of duty is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation, as a concomitant and evidence of a title to &s;alvation. There is never a title to &s;alvation with|out it, though it be not the righteou&s;ne&s;s by which a title to &s;alvation is obtained. It is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;al|vation, as it is the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of true faith. It is an evidence which univer&s;ally attends upright|ne&s;s, and the defect of it, is an infallible evidence of the want of uprightne&s;s. P&s;al. cxxv. 4. 5. There &s;uch as are good and upright in heart, are di&s;tingui&s;h|ed from &s;uch as fall away, or turn a&s;ide: <Q>Do good, O LORD, to tho&s;e that are good, and to them that are upright in their hearts. As for &s;uch as <HI>turn a&s;ide to their crooked ways,</HI> the LORD &s;hall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity. But peace &s;hall be upon I&s;rael.</Q>&mdash;It is mentioned as an evidence that the hearts of the children of I&s;rael were not right with God, that they did not per&s;evere in the ways of holine&s;s. P&s;al. lxxviii. 8. <Q>A ge|neration that &s;et not their hearts aright, and who&s;e &s;pirit was not <HI>&s;tedfa&s;t</HI> with GOD.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="016767_0131_0F9E178C658BF428">
CHRIST gives this as a di&s;tingui&s;hing character of tho&s;e that are his <HI>di&s;ciples indeed,</HI> and of a true and &s;av|ing faith, that it is accompanied with per&s;everance in the obedience of CHRIST'S word. Joh. viii. 31. <Q>Then &s;aid JESUS to tho&s;e Jews which believed on him, if ye <HI>continue</HI> in my word, then are ye my di&s;ciples indeed.</Q> This is mentioned as a nece&s;|&s;ary evidence of an intere&s;t in CHRIST, Heb. iii. 14. <Q>We are made partakers of CHRIST, if we hold the beginning of our confidence &s;tedfa&s;t to the end.</Q></P>
<P>PERSEVERANCE is not only a nece&s;&s;ary concomitant and evidence of a title to &s;alvation, but al&s;o a nece&s;|&s;ary prerequi&s;ite to the actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of eternal life. It is the only way to heaven, the narrow way that leadeth to life. Hence CHRIST exhorts the church of Philadelphia to per&s;evere in holine&s;s from this con&s;ideration, that it was nece&s;&s;ary in order to her obtaining the crown. Rev. iii. 11. Hold fa&s;t that which thou ha&s;t, that no man take thy crown. It is nece&s;&s;ary not only that per&s;ons &s;hould once have been walking in the way of duty; but that they &s;hould be found &s;o doing, when CHRIST cometh. Luke xii. 43. Ble&s;&s;ed is that &s;ervant, whom is LORD, when he cometh, &s;hall find &s;o doing.&mdash;Holding out to the end is often made the condition of actual &s;alvation. Mat. x. 22. <Q>He that endureth to the end the &s;ame &s;hall be &s;aved:</Q> and Rev. ii. 10. <Q>Be thou faithful unto the death, and I will give thee a crown of life.</Q></P>
<P N="2">2. IN order to your own per&s;everance in the way of duty, your own care and watchfulne&s;s is nece&s;&s;ary. For though it be promi&s;ed that true &s;aints &s;hall per|&s;evere, yet that is no argument that their care and watchfulne&s;s is not nece&s;&s;ary in order to it; becau&s;e their care to keep the commands of GOD, is the thing promi&s;ed. If the &s;aints &s;hould fail of care, watch|fulne&s;s
<PB N="136" REF="016767_0132_0F9E178D9BAECAC0">
and diligence to per&s;evere in holine&s;s, that failure of their care and diligence would it&s;elf be a failure of holine&s;s. They who per&s;evere hot in watchfulne&s;s and diligence, per&s;evere not in holine&s;s of life, for holine&s;s of life very much con&s;i&s;ts in watchfulne&s;s and diligence to keep the commands of GOD. It is one promi&s;e of the covenant of grace, that the &s;aints &s;hall keep GOD'S commandments. Ezek. xi. 19, 20.&mdash;Yet that is no argument that they have no need to take care to keep the&s;e com|mandments, or to do their duty. So the promi&s;e of GOD that the &s;aints &s;hall per&s;evere in holine&s;s is no argument that it is not nece&s;&s;ary, that they &s;hould take heed left they fall away.</P>
<P>THEREFORE the &s;criptures abundantly warn men to watch over them&s;elves diligently, and to give earne&s;t heed lea&s;t they fall away. 1 Cor. xv. 13. Watch ye, &s;tand fa&s;t in the faith, quit you like men, be &s;trong. 1 Cor. x. 12. Let him that thinketh he &s;tandeth, take heed le&s;t he fall. Heb. iii. 12, 13, 14. Take heed, brethren, le&s;t there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living GOD; but exhort one another daily, while it is cal|led to day, lea&s;t any of you be hardened through the deceitfulne&s;s of &s;in. For we are made partakers of CHRIST, if we hold the begining of our confidence &s;tedfa&s;t unto the end. Heb. iv. 1. Let us there|fore fear, lea&s;t a promi&s;e being left us of entering into his re&s;t, any of you &s;hould &s;eem to come &s;hort of it. 2. Pet. iii. 17. Ye therefore, beloved, &s;eeing ye know the&s;e things before, beware le&s;t ye al&s;o being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own &s;tedfa&s;tne&s;s. 2. Joh. v. 8. Look to your&s;elves that we lo&s;e not tho&s;e things, which we have wrought; but that we receive a full reward.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="016767_0133_0F9E178DED19F5A0">
THUS you &s;ee how earne&s;tly the &s;criptures pre&s;s on chri&s;tians exhortations to take diligent heed to them|&s;elves that they fall not away. And certainly the&s;e cautions are not without rea&s;on.</P>
<P>THE &s;criptures particularly in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">t upon watchful|ne&s;s in order to per&s;everance in the duty of prayer. <HI>Watch and pray,</HI> &s;aith CHRIST; which implies that we &s;hould watch <HI>unto</HI> prayer, as the apo&s;tle Peter &s;ays 1. Pet. iv. 7. It implies that we &s;hould watch again&s;t a neglect of prayer, as well as again&s;t other &s;ins. The apo&s;tle in places which have been already mentioned, directs us to pray with all prayer, <HI>watch|ing</HI> thereunto with all per&s;everance, and to <HI>continue</HI> in prayer and <HI>watch</HI> in the &s;ame.&mdash;Nor is it any won|der that the apo&s;tles &s;o much in&s;i&s;ted on watching in order to a continuance in prayer with all per&s;everance; for there are many temptations to neglect this duty; fir&s;t to be incon&s;tant in it, and from time to time to omit it; then in a great mea&s;ure to neglect it. The devil watches by temptation to draw us away from GOD, and to hinder us from going to him in prayer. We are &s;urrounded with one and another tempting object, bu&s;ine&s;s, and diver&s;ion: particularly we meet with many things, which are great temptations to a neglect of this duty.</P>
<P N="3">3. To move you to per&s;evere in the duty of pray|er, con&s;ider how much you always &s;tand in need of the help of GOD. If per&s;ons, who have formerly at|tended this duty, leave it off, the language of it is, that now they &s;tand in no further need of GOD'S help, that they have no further occa&s;ion to go to GOD with reque&s;ts and &s;upplications: when indeed it is in GOD we live, and move and have our being. We cannot draw a breath without his help. You need his help every day for the &s;upply of your outward wants; and
<PB N="138" REF="016767_0134_0F9E178EABDE4D08">
e&s;pecially you &s;tand in continual need of him to help your &s;ouls. Without his protection they would im|mediately fall into the hands of the devil, who always &s;tands as a roaring lion, ready, whenever he is per|mitted, to fall upon the &s;ouls of men and devour them.&mdash;If GOD &s;hould indeed pre&s;erve your lives, but &s;hould otherwi&s;e for&s;ake and leave you to your&s;elves, you would be mo&s;t mi&s;erable: your lives would be a cur&s;e to you.</P>
<P>THOSE that are converted, if GOD &s;hould for&s;ake them, would &s;oon fall away totally from a &s;tate of grace, into a &s;tate far more mi&s;erable than ever they were in before their conver&s;ion. They have no &s;trength of their own to re&s;i&s;t tho&s;e powerful enemies who &s;urround them. Sin and &s;atan would imme|diately carry them away, as a mighty flood, if GOD &s;hould for&s;ake them.&mdash;You &s;tand in need of daily &s;upplies from GOD. Without GOD you can receive no &s;piritual light nor comfort, can exerci&s;e no grace, can bring forth no fruit. Without GOD your &s;ouls will wither and pine away, and &s;ink into a mo&s;t wretched &s;tate. You continually need the in&s;tructi|ons and directions of GOD. What can a little child do in a va&s;t, howling wilderne&s;s, without &s;ome one to guide it, and to lead it in the right way? Without GOD you will &s;oon fall into &s;nares, and pits, and many fatal calamities.</P>
<P>SEEING therefore you &s;tand in &s;uch continual need of the help of GOD, how rea&s;onable is it that you &s;hould continually &s;eek it of him, and per&s;everingly acknowledge your dependence upon him, by re&s;orting to him to &s;pread your needs before him, and to off<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> up your reque&s;ts to him in prayer.&mdash;Let us con&s;i|der how mi&s;erable we &s;hould be, if we &s;hould leave off prayer, and GOD at the &s;ame time &s;hould leave off
<PB N="139" REF="016767_0135_0F9E178F68621E98">
to take any care of us, or to afford us any more &s;up|plies of his grace. By our con&s;tancy in prayer we cannot be profitable to GOD; and if we leave it off GOD will &s;u&s;tain no damage: he doth not need our prayers. Job. xxxv. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. 7.&mdash;But if GOD cea&s;e to care for us and to help us, we immediately <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ink: we can do nothing: we can receive nothing without him.</P>
<P N="4">4. CONSIDER the great benefit of a con&s;tant, di|ligent and per&s;evering attendance on this duty. It is one of the greate&s;t and mo&s;t excellent means of nouri&s;hing the new nature, and of cau&s;ing the &s;oul to flouri&s;h and pro&s;per. It is an excellent mean of keeping up an acquaintance with GOD, and of grow|ing in the knowledge of GOD. It is the way to a life of communion with GOD. It is an excellent mean of taking off the heart from the vanities of the world, and of cau&s;ing the mind to be conver&s;ant in heaven. It is an excellent pre&s;ervative from &s;in and the wiles of the devil, and a powerful antidote again&s;t the poi|&s;on of the old &s;erpent. It is a duty whereby &s;trength is derived from GOD again&s;t the lu&s;ts and corruptions of the heart, and the &s;nares of the world.</P>
<P>It hath a great tendency to keep the &s;oul in a wake|ful frame, and to lead us to a &s;trict walk with GOD, and to a life that &s;hall be fruitful in &s;uch good works, as tend to adorn the doctrine of CHRIST, and to cau&s;e our light &s;o to &s;hine before others, that they &s;eeing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ut good works &s;hall glorify our father who is in heaven. And if the duty be con&s;tantly and diligent|ly attended, it will be a very plea&s;ant duty. Slack and &s;othful attendance upon it, and un&s;teadine&s;s in it, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">re the cau&s;es which make it &s;o great a burden as it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to &s;ome per&s;ons: Their &s;lothfulne&s;s in it hath na|turally the effect to beget a di&s;like of the duty and a
<PB N="140" REF="016767_0136_0F9E179071D00B70">
great indi&s;po&s;ition to it. But if it be con&s;tantly and diligently attended, it is one of the be&s;t means of lead|ing not only a chri&s;tian and amiable, but al&s;o a plea|&s;ant life; a life of much &s;weet fellow&s;hip with CHRIST, and of the abundant enjoyment of the light of his countenance.</P>
<P>BESIDES, the great power which prayer, when duly attended, hath with GOD, is worthy of your notice. By it men become like Jacob, who as a prince had power with GOD and prevailed, when he wre&s;tled with GOD for the ble&s;&s;ing. See the power of prayer repre&s;ented in Jam. v. 16, 17, 18.&mdash;By the&s;e things you may be &s;en&s;ible how much you will lo&s;e, if you &s;hall be negligent of this great duty of calling upon GOD; and how ill you will con&s;ult your own intere&s;t by &s;uch a neglect.</P>
<P>I CONCLUDE my di&s;cour&s;e with two directions in order to con&s;tancy and per&s;everance in this duty.</P>
<P N="1">1. WATCH again&s;t the beginnings of a neglect of this duty. Per&s;ons who have for a time practi&s;ed this duty, and afterwards neglect it, commonly leave it off by degrees. While their convictions and re|ligious affections la&s;t, they are very con&s;tant in their clo&s;ets, and no worldly bu&s;ine&s;s, or company, or diver&s;ion hinders them. But as their convictions and affections begin to die away, they begin to find ex|cu&s;es to neglect it &s;ometimes. They are now &s;o hurried; they have now &s;uch and &s;uch things to at|tend to; or there are now &s;uch inconveniencies in the way, that they per&s;uade them&s;elves, they may very excu&s;ably omit it for this time. Afterwards it pretty frequently &s;o happens, that they have &s;ome|thing to hinder, &s;omething which they call a ju&s;t ex|cu&s;e. After a while a le&s;s thing becomes a &s;ufficient excu&s;e, than was allowed to be &s;uch at fir&s;t. Thus
<PB N="141" REF="016767_0137_0F9E1790E2FE0DB8">
the per&s;on by degrees contracts more and more of an habit of neglecting prayer, and becomes more and more indi&s;po&s;ed to it. And even when he doth perform it, it is in &s;uch a poor, dull, heartle&s;s, mi&s;erable manner, that he &s;ays to him&s;elf, he might as well not do it at all, as do it &s;o. Thus he makes his own dulne&s;s and indi&s;po&s;ition an excu&s;e for wholly neglecting it, or at lea&s;t for living in a great mea&s;ure in the neglect of it.&mdash;After this manner do &s;atan and men's own cor|ruptions inveigle them to their ruin.</P>
<P>THEREFORE beware of the fir&s;t beginnings of a neglect: Watch again&s;t temptations to it: Take heed how you begin to allow of excu&s;es. Be watch|ful to keep up the duty in the height of it; let it not &s;o much as begin to &s;ink. For when you give way, though it be but little, it is like giving way to an enemy in the field of battle; the fir&s;t beginning of a retreat greatly encourages the enemy, and weakens the retreating &s;oldiers.</P>
<P N="2">2. LET me direct you to for&s;ake all &s;uch practi|ces, as you find by experience do indi&s;po&s;e you to the duty of &s;ecret prayer. Examine the things in which you have allowed your&s;elves, and inquire whe|ther they have had this effect. You are able to look over your pa&s;t behaviour, and may doubtle&s;s, on an impartial con&s;ideration, make a judgment of the practices and cour&s;es in which you have allowed your|&s;elves.</P>
<P>PARTICULARLY let young people examine their manner of <HI>company keeping</HI> and the round of diver&s;i|ons, in which with their companions they have allow|ed them&s;elves. I only de&s;ire that you would a&s;k at the mouth of your own con&s;ciences, what has been the effect of the&s;e things with re&s;pect t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> your atten|dance on the duty of &s;ecret prayer. Have you not
<PB N="142" REF="016767_0138_0F9E17921C3F0C70">
found that &s;uch practices have tended to the neglect of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s duty? Have you not found that after them you have been more indi&s;po&s;ed to it and le&s;s con&s;ci|entious and careful to attend it? Yea have they not from time to time, actually been the means of your neglecting it?</P>
<P>IF you cannot deny that this is really the ca&s;e, then if you &s;eek the good of your &s;ouls, for&s;ake the&s;e practices. Whatever you may plead for them, as that there is no hurt in them, or that there is a time for all things, and the like; yet if you find this hurt in the con&s;equence of them, it is time for you to for|&s;ake them. And if you value heaven more than a little wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ly diver&s;ion; if you &s;et an higher price on eternal glory, than on a dance or a &s;ong, you will for&s;ake them.</P>
<P>IF th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e things be lawful in them&s;elves, yet if your experience &s;how, that they are attended with &s;uch a con&s;equence as I have now mentioned, that is enough. It is lawful in it&s;elf fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> you to enjoy your right hand and your right eye. But if by experience you find they cau&s;e you to offend; it is time for you to cut off the one, and pluck out the other, as you would ra|ther go to heaven without them, than go to hell with them, into that place of torment, where the worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.</P>

<P>IN the former part of this chapter we have a dread|ful catalogue of the &s;ins of Jeru&s;alem; as you may &s;ee from the fir&s;t to the thirteenth ver&s;e.

"Behold I have &s;mitten mine hand at thy di&s;hone&s;t gain which thou ha&s;t made, and at thy blood which hath been in the mid&s;t of thee" The expre&s;&s;ion of GOD'S &s;mit|ing his hand, &s;ignifies the greatne&s;s of his anger, and his preparing him&s;elf, as it were to execute wrath an|&s;werable to their heinous crimes.

IN handling this doctrine, I &s;hall 1. Show what is implied in GOD'S undertaking to deal with impeni|tent &s;inners. 2. That therefore they cannot avoid puni&s;hment. 3. That they cannot in any mea&s;ure deliver them&s;elves from it, or do any thing for their own relief under it. 4. That they cannot bear it. 5. I &s;hall an&s;wer an inquiry; and then proceed to the u&s;e.</P>
<P>I. I SHALL &s;how what is implied in GOD'S under|taking to deal with impenitent &s;inners.&mdash;Others are not able to deal with them. They baffle all the means u&s;ed with them by tho&s;e that are appointed to teach and to rule over them. They will not yield to parents; or to the coun&s;el<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, warnings or reproofs of mini&s;ters: they prove ob&s;tinate and &s;tiff-hearted. Therefore GOD undertakes to deal with them.&mdash;This implies the following things.</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT GOD will reckon with them, and take of them &s;atisfaction to his ju&s;tice. In this world GOD puts forth his authority to command them, and to re|quire &s;ubjection to him. In his commands he is ve|ry po&s;itive, &s;trictly requiring of them the performance of &s;uch and &s;uch duties, and as po&s;itively forbidding &s;uch and &s;uch things which are contrary to their duty. But they have no regard to the&s;e commands. GOD continues commanding and they continue rebel|ling. They make nothing of GOD'S authority GOD threatens, but they de&s;pi&s;e his threatenings.&mdash;They make nothing of di&s;honouring GOD: they care not how much their behaviour is to the di&s;honour of GOD. He offers them mercy, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> they will repent and return: but they de&s;pi&s;e his mercy as well as his wrath. GOD calleth, but they refu&s;e&mdash;Thus they are continually plunging them|&s;elves deeper and deeper in debt, and at the &s;ame time
<PB N="146" REF="016767_0142_0F9E179720063A18">
imagine they &s;hall e&s;cape the payment of the debt, and de&s;ign entirely to rob GOD of his due.</P>
<P>BUT GOD hath undertaken to right him&s;elf. He will reckon with them; he hath undertaken to &s;ee that the debts due to him are paid. All their &s;ins are written in his book; not one of them is forgotten, and every one mu&s;t be paid. If GOD be wi&s;e enough and &s;trong enough, he will have full &s;atisfaction; he will exact the very uttermo&s;t farthing. He under|takes it as his part, as what belongs to him, to &s;ee him&s;elf righted, wherein he hath been wronged. Deut. xxxii. 35. "To me belongeth vengeance." ibid. vii. 10. <Q>He will not be &s;lack to him that hateth him; he will repay him to his face.</Q></P>
<P N="2">2. HE hath undertaken to vindicate the honour of his maje&s;ty. His maje&s;ty they de&s;pi&s;e. They hear that he is a great GOD; but they de&s;pi&s;e his greatne&s;s; they look upon him worthy of contempt, and treat him accordingly. They hear of him by the name of a great king; but his authority they regard not and &s;ometimes trample upon it, for years together.</P>
<P>BUT GOD hath not left the honour of his maje&s;ty wholly to their care. Though they now trample it in the du&s;t, yet that is no &s;ign that it will finally be lo&s;t. If GOD had left it wholly in their hands, it would indeed be lo&s;t. But GOD doth not leave his honour and his glory with his enemies; it is too pre|cious in his eyes to be &s;o neglected. He hath re&s;erv|ed the care of it to him&s;elf: he will &s;ee to it that his own injured maje&s;ty is vindicated. If the honour of GOD, upon which &s;inners trample, finally lie in the du&s;t, then it will be becau&s;e he is not &s;trong enough to vindicate him&s;elf. He hath &s;worn that great oath in Num. xiv. 21. <Q>As truly as I live, all the earth &s;hall be filled with the glory of the LORD.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="016767_0143_0F9E1797A4A8C7E8">
SINNERS de&s;pi&s;e his &s;on and trample him under their feet. But he will &s;ee, if he cannot make the glory of his &s;on appear, with re&s;pect to them; that all the earth may know how evil a thing it is to di&s;|pi&s;e the Son of GOD.&mdash;GOD intends that all men and angels, all heaven and all earth &s;hall &s;ee whether he be &s;ufficient to magnify him&s;elf upon &s;inners, who now de&s;pi&s;e him. He intends that the i&s;&s;ue of things, with re&s;pect to them, &s;hall be open, that all men may &s;ee it.</P>
<P N="3">3. HE hath undertaken to &s;ubdue impenitent &s;in|ners. Their hearts while in this world are very un|&s;ubdued. They lift up their heads and conduct ve|ry proudly and contemptuou&s;ly, and often &s;in with an high hand. They &s;et their mouths again&s;t the heavens, and their tongues walk through the earth. They practically &s;ay as Pharaoh did, <Q>Who is the LORD? I know not the LORD, neither will I obey his voice.</Q> Job. xxi. 41. <Q>They &s;ay to GOD, depart from us, for we de&s;ire not the knowledge of thy ways.</Q></P>
<P>SOME, who cover their &s;in with &s;pecious &s;how; who put on a face of religion, and a demure counte|nance and behaviour; yet have this &s;pirit &s;ecretly reigning in their brea&s;ts. Notwith&s;tanding all their fair &s;how, and good external carriage, they de&s;pi&s;e GOD in their hearts, and have the weapons of war about them; though they are &s;ecret enemies and carry their &s;words under their &s;kirts. They have mo&s;t proud, &s;tubborn and rebellious hearts, which are ready to ri&s;e in oppo&s;ition, to contend with him, and to find fault with his di&s;pen&s;ations. Their hearts are full of pride, enmity, &s;tubbornne&s;s and bla&s;phe|my, which work in them many ways, while they &s;it under the preaching of the word, and while the &s;pi|rit

of GOD is &s;triving with them; and they always continue to oppo&s;e and re&s;i&s;t GOD, as long as they live in the world; they never lay down the weapons of their rebellion.</P>
<P>BUT GOD hath undertaken to deal with them and to &s;ubdue them; and tho&s;e proud and &s;tubborn hearts, which will not yield to the power of GOD'S word, &s;hall be broken by the power of his hand. If they will not be willing &s;ubjects to the golden &s;ceptre, and will not yield to the attractives of his love; they &s;hall be &s;ubject to the force of the iron rod, whether they will or no.</P>
<P>THEM that proudly &s;et up their own righteou&s;|ne&s;s, and their own wills again&s;t GOD, GOD hath un|dertaken to bring down: and without doubt it will be done. He hath undertaken to make tho&s;e who are now regardle&s;s of GOD, regard him. They &s;hall know that he is JEHOVAH. Now they will not own that he is the LORD; but they &s;hall know it.

<P>Now wicked men not only hate GOD, but they &s;light him; they are not afraid of him. But he will &s;ubdue their contempt. When he &s;hall come to take them in hand, they will hate him &s;till, but they will not &s;light him; they will n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t make light of his power, as they now do; they will &s;ee and feel too much of the infinity of his power, to &s;light it.&mdash;They are now went to &s;light his wrath; but then they will &s;light it no more, they will be infinitely far from it, they will find by &s;ufficient experience that his wrath is not to be &s;lighted: they will learn this to their co&s;t, and they never will forget it.</P>
<P N="4">4. GOD hath undertaken to rectify their judgments. Now they will not be convinced of tho&s;e things which
<PB N="149" REF="016767_0145_0F9E179925087BE8">
GOD tells them in his word. Mini&s;ters take much pains to convince them, but all is in vain. There|fore GOD will undertake to convince them, and he will do it effectually.&mdash;Now they will not be convinced of the truth of divine things. They have indeed convincing arguments &s;et before them; they hear and &s;ee enough to convince them; yet &s;o prone are they to unbelief and athei&s;m, that divine things never &s;eem to them to be real. But GOD will hereafter make them &s;eem real.</P>
<P>Now they are always doubting of the truth of the &s;criptures, que&s;tioning whether they be the word of GOD, and whether the threatenings of &s;cripture be true. But GOD hath undertaken to convince them that tho&s;e threatenings are true, and he will make them to know that they are true, &s;o that they will never doubt any more for ever. They will be convinced by dear experience.&mdash;Now they are always que&s;tioning whether there be any &s;uch place as hell. They hear much about it, but it always &s;eems to them like a dream. But GOD will make it &s;eem otherwi&s;e than a dream.&mdash;Now they are often told of the vanity of the world; but we may as well preach to the bea&s;ts, to per&s;uade them of the vanity of earthly things. But GOD will undertake to convince them of this; he will hereafter give them a thorough conviction of it, &s;o that they &s;hall have a &s;trong &s;en&s;e of the vanity of all the&s;e things.</P>
<P>Now mini&s;ters often tell &s;inners of the great im|portance of an intere&s;t in CHRIST, and that that is the one thing needful. They are al&s;o told the folly of delaying the care of their &s;ouls, and how much it concerns them to improve their opportunity. But the in&s;tructions of mini&s;ters do not convince them, therefore GOD will undertake to convince them.</P>

He will convince them of their folly and &s;tupidity in entertaining &s;uch notions, as they now en|tertain.</P>
<P>THUS GOD hath undertaken to deal with ob&s;tinate unbelievers.

I come now,</P>
<P>II. To &s;how that therefore impenitent &s;inners &s;hall not avoid their due puni&s;hment.&mdash;GOD hath undertaken to inflict it; he hath engaged to do it; he takes it as his work, as what properly belongs to him, and we may expect it of him. If he hath &s;worn by his life, that he will do it; and if he hath power &s;ufficient, if he is the living GOD, doubtle&s;s we &s;hall &s;ee it done. And that GOD hath declared that he will puni&s;h impenitent &s;inners, is manife&s;t from many &s;criptures; as, Deut. xxxii. 41. <Q>I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward them that hate me.</Q> Deut. vii. 10. <Q>He will not be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lack to him that hateth him: he will repay him to his face.</Q> Exod. xxxiv. 7. <Q>That will by no means clear the guilty.</Q> Nahum i. 3. <Q>The LORD is &s;low to anger, and great in power, and will not at all acquit the wicked.</Q></P>
<P>GOD &s;aith in the text, <Q>I the LORD have &s;poken it, and will do it;</Q> which leaves no room to doubt of the actual fulfilment of the threatening in its utmo&s;t extent.&mdash;Some wicked men have flattered them|&s;elves, that although GOD hath threatened very dread|ful things to wicked men for their &s;ins, yet in his heart he never intends to fulfil his threatenings, but only to terrify them, and make them afraid, while they live. But would the infinitely holy GOD, who is not a man that he &s;hould lie, and who &s;peaketh no vain words, utter him&s;elf in this manner, <HI>I the Lord have &s;poken it, and will do it; I have not only threat|ened, but I will al&s;o fulfil my threatenings;</HI> when at the &s;ame time the&s;e words did not agree with his heart, but he &s;ecretly knew that though he had &s;poken, yet he intended not to do it?

No; let no impenitent &s;inner flatter him&s;elf &s;o vainly and fooli&s;hly. If it were indeed only a man, a being of like impotency and mutability with them|&s;elves, who had undertaken to deal with them; they might perhaps with &s;ome rea&s;on flatter them&s;elves, that they &s;hould find &s;ome means to avoid the threat|ened puni&s;hment. But &s;ince an omni&s;cient, omnipo|tent, immutable GOD hath undertaken, vain are all &s;uch hopes.</P>
<P>THERE is no hope that po&s;&s;ibly they may &s;teal away to heaven, though they die unconverted. There is no hope that they can deceive GOD by any fal&s;e &s;how of repentance and faith, and &s;o be taken to hea|ven through mi&s;take: for the eyes of GOD are as a flame of fire; they perfectly &s;ee through every man; the inmo&s;t clo&s;et of the heart is all open to him.</P>
<P>THERE is no hope of e&s;caping the threatened pu|ni&s;hment by &s;inking into nothing at death, like brute creatures. Indeed many wicked men upon their death-beds wi&s;h for this. If it were &s;o, death would be nothing to them in compari&s;on with what it now is. But all &s;uch wi&s;hes are vain.</P>
<P>THERE is no hope of their e&s;caping without no|tice, when they leave the body. There is no hope that GOD by rea&s;on of the multiplicity of affairs, which he hath to mind, will happen to overlook them, and not take notice of them, when they come to die; and &s;o that their &s;ouls will &s;lip away pri|vately, and hide them&s;elves in &s;ome &s;ecret corner, and &s;o e&s;cape divine vengeance.</P>
<P>THERE is no hope that they &s;hall be mi&s;&s;ed in a crowd, at the day of judgment, and that they can have opportunity to hide them&s;elves in &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> or den of the mountains, or in any &s;ecret hole of the earth; and that while &s;o doing they will not be mind|ed,

<P>IV. To &s;how, that neither will they be able to bear it. Neither will their hands be &s;trong to deliver them&s;elves from it, nor will their hearts be able to endure it. It is common with men, when they meet with calamities in this world, in the fir&s;t place to en|deavour to &s;hun them. But if they find, that they cannot &s;hun them; then after they are come, they en|deavour to deliver them&s;elves from them, as &s;oon as they can; or at lea&s;t to order things &s;o, as to deliver them&s;elves in &s;ome degree. But if they find that they can by no means deliver them&s;elves, and &s;ee that the ca&s;e is &s;o that they mu&s;t bear them; then they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

They clothe them&s;elves with all the re&s;olution and courage they are ma&s;ters of, to keep their &s;pirits from &s;inking under their calamities.</P>
<P>BUT it will be utterly in vain for impenitent &s;in|ners, to think to do thus, with re&s;pect to the torments of hell. They will not be able to endure them, or at all to &s;upport them&s;elves under them: the torment will be immen&s;ely beyond their &s;trength. What will it &s;ignify for a worm, which is about to be pre&s;&s;ed under the weight of &s;ome great rock, to be let fall with its whole weight upon it, to collect its &s;trength, to &s;et it&s;elf to bear up the weight of the rock, and to pre&s;erve it&s;elf from being cru&s;hed by it?&mdash;Much more in vain will it be for a poor damned &s;oul, to endeavour to &s;upport it&s;elf, under the weight of the wrath of Almighty GOD. What is the &s;trength of man, who is b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t a worm, to &s;upport him&s;elf again&s;t the power of Jehovah, and again&s;t the fiercene&s;s of his wrath?

<P>WHEN &s;inners hear of hell-torments, they &s;ometimes think with them&s;elves; Well, if it &s;hall come to that, that I mu&s;t go to hell, I will bear it as well as I can: as if by cloathing them&s;elves with re&s;olution and firmne&s;s of mind, they would be able to &s;upport them&s;elves in &s;ome mea&s;ure: when alas! they will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ave no re&s;olution, no courage at all. However they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> all have prepared them&s;elves, and collected their &s;trength; yet as &s;oon as they &s;hall begin to feel that

wrath, their hearts will melt and be as water. How|ever before they may &s;eem to harden their hearts, in order to prepare them&s;elves to bear, yet the fir&s;t mo|ment they feel it, their hearts will become like wax before the furnace. Their courage and re&s;olution will be all gone in an in&s;tant; it will vani&s;h away like a &s;hadow in the twinkling of an eye. The &s;tout|e&s;t and mo&s;t &s;turdy will have no more courage than the feeble&s;t infant: let a man be an infant, or a giant, it will be all one. They will not be able to keep alive any courage, any &s;trength, any comfort, any hope at all.&mdash;I come now as was propo&s;ed,</P>
<P>V. To an&s;wer an enquiry which may naturally be rai&s;ed concerning the&s;e things.</P>
<P>ENQ. SOME may be ready to &s;ay, if this be the ca&s;e, if impenitent &s;inners can neither &s;hun future puni&s;hment, nor deliver them&s;elves from it, nor bear it; then what will become of them?</P>
<P>ANSW. THEY will wholly &s;ink down into eternal death. There will be that &s;inking of heart, of which we now cannot conceive. We &s;ee how it is with the body, when in extreme pain. The nature of the bo|dy will &s;upport it&s;elf for a con&s;iderable time, under very great pain, &s;o as to keep from wholly &s;inking. There will be great &s;truggles, lamentable groans and panting, and it may be convul&s;ions. The&s;e are the &s;trugglings of nature to &s;upport it&s;elf under the extre|mity of the pain. There is, as it were, a great loath|ne&s;s in nature to yield to it; it cannot bear wholly to &s;ink.</P>
<P>BUT yet &s;ometimes pain of body is &s;o very extreme and exqui&s;ite, that the nature of the body cannot &s;upport it&s;elf under it; however loath it may be to &s;ink, yet it cannot bear the pain; there are a few &s;truggles and throws and pantings, and it may be a
<PB N="159" REF="016767_0155_0F9E17A4D756DA80">
&s;hriek or two, and then nature yields to the violence of the torments, &s;inks down, and the body dies. This is the death of the body. So it will be with the &s;oul in hell; it will have no &s;trength or power to deliver it&s;elf, and it's torment and horror will be &s;o great, &s;o mighty, &s;o va&s;tly di&s;proportioned to its &s;trength, that having no &s;trength in the lea&s;t to &s;up|port it&s;elf, although it be infinitely contrary to the nature and inclination of the &s;oul utterly to &s;ink; yet it will &s;ink, it will utterly and totally &s;ink, without the lea&s;t degree of remaining comfort, or &s;trength, or courage, or hope. And though it will never be an|nihilated, its being and perception will never be abo|li&s;hed; yet &s;uch will be the infinite depth of gloomi|ne&s;s that it will &s;ink into, that it will be in a &s;tate of death, eternal death.</P>
<P>THE nature of man de&s;ires happine&s;s; it is the na|ture of the &s;oul to crave and thir&s;t after well being: and if it be under mi&s;ery, it eagerly pants after relief; and the greater the mi&s;ery is, the more eagerly doth it &s;truggle for help. But if all relief be withhold<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> all &s;trength overborn, all &s;upport utterly gone; then it &s;inks into the darkne&s;s of death.</P>
<P>WE can conceive but little of the matter; we can|not conceive what that &s;inking of the &s;oul, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, is. But to help your conception, imagine your|&s;elf to be ca&s;t into a fiery oven, all of a glowing heat, or into the mid&s;t of a glowing brick-kiln, or of a great furnace, where your pain would be as much greater than that occa&s;ioned by accidentally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ching <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> coal of fire, as the heat is greater.

And after you had endured it for one minute, how over-bearing would it be to you, to think that you had it to endure the other fourteen!</P>
<P>BUT what would be the effect on your &s;oul, if you knew you mu&s;t lie there enduring that torment to the full for twenty-four hours! And how much greater would be the effect, if you knew you mu&s;t endure it for a whole year; and how va&s;tly greater &s;till, if you knew you mu&s;t endure it for a thou&s;and years!&mdash;O then how would your heart &s;ink, if you thought, if you knew, that you mu&s;t bear it for ever and ever! that there would be no end! that after millions of millions of ages, your torment would be no nearer to an end, than ever it was; and that you never, never &s;hould be delivered!</P>
<P>BUT your torment in hell will be immen&s;ely greater than this illu&s;tration repre&s;ents. How then will the heart of a poor creature &s;ink under it! How utterly inexpre&s;&s;ible and inconceivable mu&s;t the &s;inking of the &s;oul be in &s;uch a ca&s;e!</P>
<P>THIS is the death threatened in the law. This is dying in the highe&s;t &s;en&s;e of the word. This is to die &s;en&s;ibly; to die and know it; to be &s;en&s;ible of the gloom of death. This is to be undone; this is worthy of the name of de&s;truction. This &s;inking of the &s;oul under an infinite weight, which it cannot bear, is the gloom of hell.

<P>DOCTRINE. The mi&s;ery of the wicked in hell, will be ab&s;olutely eternal.</P>
<P>THERE ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> diver&s;e opinions that I mean to op|po&s;e in this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. One is, that the eternal death that wicked men are threatened with in &s;cripture, &s;ig|nifies no more than eternal annihilation; that men will be the &s;ubjects of eternal death, as they will be &s;lain, and their life finally and forever be extingui&s;hed by GOD'S anger; that GOD will puni&s;h their wickedne&s;s by eternally aboli&s;hing their being, and &s;o that they &s;hall &s;uffer eternal death in this &s;en&s;e, that they &s;hall be eternally dead, and never more come to life.</P>
<P>THE other opinion which I mean to oppo&s;e is, that though the puni&s;hment of the wicked &s;hall con&s;i&s;t in &s;en&s;ible mi&s;ery, yet it &s;hall not be ab&s;olutely eternal; but only of a very long continuance.</P>
<P>THEREFORE to e&s;tabli&s;h the doctrine in oppo&s;ition to the&s;e different opinions, I &s;hall undertake to &s;how,

<P>I. I AM to &s;how that it is not contrary to the di|vine perfections, to inflict on wicked men a puni&s;h|ment that is ab&s;olutely eternal.</P>
<P>THIS is the &s;um of the objections u&s;ually made again&s;t this doctrine, that it is incon&s;i&s;tent with the ju&s;tice, and e&s;pecially with the <HI>mercy</HI> of GOD. And &s;ome &s;ay, If it be &s;trictly <HI>ju&s;t,</HI> yet how can we &s;uppo&s;e that a merciful GOD can bear eternally to torment his creatures.</P>
<P N="1">1. THEN I &s;hall briefly &s;how that it is not incon|&s;i&s;tent with the ju&s;tice of GOD to inflict an eternal puni&s;hment. To evince this, I &s;hall u&s;e only one ar|gument, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that &s;in is heinous enough to de&s;erve &s;uch a puni&s;hment, and &s;uch a puni&s;hment is no more than proportionable to the evil or d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">merit of &s;in. If the evil of &s;in be infinite, as the puni&s;hment is, then it is manife&s;t that the puni&s;hment is no more than proportionable to the &s;in puni&s;hed, and is no more than &s;in de&s;erves. And if the obligation to love, honor and obey GOD be infinite, then &s;in which is the violation of this obligation, is a violation of infinite obligation, and &s;o is an infinite evil. Again, if GOD be infinitely worthy of love, honor and obedience, then our obligation to love and honor and obey him is infinitely great.&mdash;So that GOD being infinitely glorious, or infinitely worthy of our love, honor and obedience; our obligation to love, honor and obey
<PB N="173" REF="016767_0169_0F9E17B1F8F089C0">
him, and &s;o to avoid all &s;in is infinitely great. Again, our obligation to love, honor and obey GOD being infinitely great, &s;in is the violation of infinite obliga|tion, and &s;o is an infinite evil. Once more, &s;in being an infinite evil, de&s;erves an infinite puni&s;hment, an infinite puni&s;hment is no more than it de&s;erves: Therefore &s;uch puni&s;hment is ju&s;t; which was the thing to be proved.&mdash;There is no evading the force of this rea&s;oning, but by denying that GOD, the &s;overeign of the univer&s;e, is infinitely glorious; which I pre&s;ume none of my hearers will adventure to do.</P>
<P N="2">2. I AM to &s;how that it is not incon&s;i&s;tent with the <HI>mercy</HI> of GOD to inflict an eternal puni&s;hment on wicked men. It is an unrea&s;onable and un&s;criptu|ral notion of the mercy of GOD, that he is merciful in &s;uch a &s;en&s;e, that he cannot bear that penal ju&s;tice &s;hould be execut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">. This is to conceive of the mer|cy of GOD as a pa&s;&s;ion to which his nature is &s;o &s;ub|ject, that GOD is liable to be moved, and affected, and overcome by &s;eeing a creature in mi&s;ery, &s;o that he cannot bear to &s;ee ju&s;tice executed: which is a mo&s;t unworthy and ab&s;urd notion of the mercy of GOD, and would, if true, argue great weakne&s;s.&mdash;It would be a great defect and not a perfection in the &s;overeign and &s;upreme judge of the world, to be mer|ciful in &s;uch a &s;en&s;e, that he could not bear to have penal ju&s;tice executed. It is a very un&s;criptural no|tion of the mercy of GOD. The &s;criptures every where repre&s;ent the mercy of GOD as free and &s;ove|reign, and not that the exerci&s;es of it are nece&s;&s;ary, &s;o that GOD cannot bear ju&s;tice &s;hould take place. The &s;criptures abundantly &s;peak of it as the glory of the divine attribute of <HI>mercy,</HI> that it is free and &s;overeign <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> its exerci&s;es; and not that it is &s;o, that GOD cannot

<PB N="174" REF="016767_0170_0F9E17B4A334F468">
help but deliver &s;inners from mi&s;ery. This is a mean and mo&s;t unworthy idea of the divine mercy.</P>
<P>IT is mo&s;t ab&s;urd al&s;o as it is contrary to plain fact. For if there be any meaning in the objection, this is &s;uppo&s;ed in it, that all mi&s;ery of the creature, whether ju&s;t or unju&s;t, is in it&s;elf contrary to the na|ture of GOD. For if his mercy be of &s;uch a nature, that a very great degree of mi&s;ery, though ju&s;t, is contrary to his nature: then it is only to add to the mercy, and then a le&s;s degree of mi&s;ery is contrary to his nature; again to add further to it, and a &s;till le&s;s degree of mi&s;ery is contrary to his nature. And &s;o the mercy of GOD being infinite, all mi&s;ery mu&s;t be contrary to his nature; which we &s;ee to be contrary to fact: for we &s;ee that GOD in his providence, doth indeed inflict very great calamities on mankind even in this life.</P>
<P>HOWEVER &s;trong &s;uch kind of objections again&s;t the eternal mi&s;ery of the wicked, may &s;eem to the car|nal, &s;en&s;ele&s;s hearts of men, as though it were again&s;t GOD'S ju&s;tice and mercy; yet their &s;eeming &s;trength, and its &s;eeming to be incredible that GOD &s;hould give over any of his creatures to &s;uch a dreadful calamity as eternal, helple&s;s mi&s;ery and torment, altogether ari|&s;es from a want of a &s;en&s;e of the infinite evil, odiou&s;|ne&s;s and provocation, that there is in &s;in. Hence it &s;eems to us not &s;uitable that any poor creature &s;hould be the &s;ubject of &s;uch mi&s;ery, becau&s;e we have no &s;en&s;e of any thing abominable and provoking in any creature an&s;werable to it. If we had, then this infinite calamity would not &s;eem un&s;uitable. For one thing would but appear an&s;werable and proportionable to another, and &s;o the mind would re&s;t in it as fit and &s;uitable, and no more than what is proper to be or|dered by the ju&s;t, holy and good governor of the world.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="016767_0171_0F9E17B5B3B9ED98">
THAT this is &s;o, we may be convinced by this con|&s;ideration, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that when we hear or read, as &s;ome|times we do, of very horrid things committed by &s;ome men, as for in&s;tance, &s;ome horrid in&s;tance of cruelty, it may be to &s;ome poor innocent child, or &s;ome holy martyr; when we read or hear how &s;uch and &s;uch per&s;ons delighted them&s;elves in torturing them with lingering torments; what terrible di&s;tre&s;s the poor, innocent creatures were in, under their hands, for many days together; and their cruel per|&s;ecutors, having no regard to their &s;hrieks and cries, only &s;ported them&s;elves with their mi&s;ery, and would not &s;afe even to put an end to their lives:&mdash;I &s;ay, when we hear or read of &s;uch things, we have a &s;en&s;e of the evil of them, and they make a deep impre&s;&s;ion on our minds. Hence it &s;eems ju&s;t, and not only &s;o, but every way fit and &s;uitable that GOD &s;hould in|flict a very terrible puni&s;hment on per&s;ons who have perpetuated &s;uch wickedne&s;s: It &s;eems, no way di&s;a|greeable to any perfection of the judge of the world; we can think of it without being at all &s;hocked. The rea&s;on is, that we have a &s;en&s;e of the evil of their conduct, and a &s;en&s;e of the proportion there is be|tween the evil or demerit of their conduct and the puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>JUST &s;o if we &s;aw a proportion between the evil of &s;in and eternal puni&s;hment, if we &s;aw &s;omething in wicked men that &s;hould appear as hateful to us, as eternal mi&s;ery appears dreadful; &s;omething that &s;hould as much &s;tir up indignation and dete&s;tation, as eternal mi&s;ery does terror; all objections again&s;t this doc|trine would vani&s;h at once. Though now it &s;eem in|credible; though when we hear of it and are &s;o often <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">old of it, we know not how to realize it; though <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hen we hear of &s;uch a degree and duration of tor|ments,

as are held forth in this doctrine, and think what eternity is, it is ready to &s;eem impo&s;&s;ible, that &s;uch torments &s;hould be inflicted on poor, feeble crea|tures, by a creator of infinite mercy: yet this ari&s;es principally from the&s;e two cau&s;es, (1.) That it is &s;o contrary to the depraved inclinations of mankind, they are &s;o aver&s;e to the truth of this doctrine, they hate to believe it, and cannot bear it &s;hould be true. (2.) That they &s;ee not the &s;uitablene&s;s of eternal puni&s;hment to the evil of &s;in; they &s;ee not that eternal puni&s;hment is proportionable and no more than pro|portionable to the demerit of &s;in.</P>
<P>HAVING thus &s;hown that the eternal puni&s;hment of the wicked is not incon&s;i&s;tent with the divine per|fections, I &s;hall now proceed further, and undertake to &s;how that it is &s;o far from being incon&s;i&s;tent with the divine perfections, that tho&s;e perfections evident|ly require it; i. e. they require that &s;in &s;hould have &s;o great a puni&s;hment, either in the per&s;on who has committed it, or in a &s;urety; and therefore with re|&s;pect to tho&s;e who believe not in the &s;urety, and have no intere&s;t in him, the divine perfections require that this puni&s;hment &s;hould be inflicted on them.</P>
<P>THIS appears, as it is not only not un&s;uitable, that &s;in &s;hould be thus puni&s;hed; but it is po&s;itively &s;ui|table, decent and proper.&mdash;If this be made to ap|pear that it is po&s;itively &s;uitable, that &s;in &s;hould be thus puni&s;hed, then it will follow, that the perfections of GOD require it; for certainly the perfections of GOD require that that &s;hould be done, which is pro|per to be done. The perfection, and excellency of the nature of GOD require, that that &s;hould take place which is perfect, excellent and proper in its own na|ture. But that &s;in &s;hould be puni&s;hed eternally is &s;uch a thing; which appears by the following con&s;i|derations.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="177" REF="016767_0173_0F9E17B7E8BFC728">
1. IT is &s;uitable that GOD &s;hould infinitely hate &s;in, and be an infinite enemy to it. Sin, as I have before &s;hown, is an infinite evil, and therefore is infi|nitely odious and dete&s;table&punc; It is proper that GOD &s;hould hate every evil, and hate it according to its odious and dete&s;table nature. And &s;in being infinite|ly evil and odious, it is proper that GOD &s;hould hate it infinitely.</P>
<P N="2">2. IF infinite hatred of &s;in be &s;uitable to the di|vine character, then the expre&s;&s;ions of &s;uch hatred are al&s;o &s;uitable to his character. If it be &s;uitable that GOD &s;hould hate &s;in, then it is &s;uitable he &s;hould expre&s;s that hatred. Becau&s;e that which is &s;uitable to be, is &s;uitable to be expre&s;&s;ed: that which is love|ly in it&s;elf, is lovely when it appears. If it be &s;ui|table that GOD &s;hould be an infinite enemy to &s;in, or that he &s;hould hate it infinitely, then it is &s;uitable that he &s;hould act as &s;uch an enemy. No po&s;&s;ible rea&s;on can be given why it is not &s;uitable for GOD to <HI>act</HI> as &s;uch an one, as it is &s;uitable for him to <HI>be.</HI> If it be &s;uitable that he &s;hould hate and have enmity again&s;t &s;in, then it is &s;uitable for him to expre&s;s that hatred and enmity, in that to which hatred and enmity by its own nature tends.&mdash;But certainly hatred in its own nature tends to oppo&s;ition, and to &s;et it&s;elf again&s;t that which is hated, and to procure its evil and not its good: and that in proportion to the hatred. Great hatred naturally tends to the great evil, and infinite hatred to the infinite evil, of its object.</P>
<P>WHENCE it follows, that if it be &s;uitable that there &s;hould be infinite hatred of &s;in in GOD, as I have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">own it is, it is &s;uitable that he &s;hould execute an in|finite puni&s;hment on it; and &s;o the perfections of GOD require that he &s;hould puni&s;h &s;in with an infi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters"> or which is the &s;ame thing, with an eternal pu|ni&s;hment.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="016767_0174_0F9E17B8A9C99220">
THUS we &s;ee not only the great objection again&s;t this doctrine an&s;wered, but the truth of the doctrine e&s;tabli&s;hed by rea&s;on.&mdash;I now proceed further to e&s;tabli&s;h it, by con&s;idering the remaining particulars under the doctrine.</P>
<P>II. THAT eternal death or puni&s;hment, which GOD threatens to the wicked, is not annihilation, but an abiding, &s;en&s;ible puni&s;hment or mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>THE truth of this propo&s;ition will appear by the following particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE &s;cripture every where repre&s;ents the pu|ni&s;hment of the wicked, as implying very extreme pains and &s;ufferings; but a &s;tate of annihilation is no &s;tate of &s;uffering at all. Per&s;ons annihilated have no &s;en&s;e or feeling of pain or plea&s;ure, and much le&s;s do they feel that puni&s;hment which carries in it an <HI>extreme</HI> pain or &s;uffering.&mdash;They no more &s;uffer to eter|nity, than they did &s;uffer from eternity.</P>
<P N="2">2. IT is agreeable both to &s;cripture and rea&s;on, to &s;uppo&s;e, that the wicked will be puni&s;hed in &s;uch a manner, that they &s;hall be &s;en&s;ible of the puni&s;hment they are under; that they &s;hould be &s;en&s;ible, that now GOD has executed and fulfilled what he threa|tened, and which they di&s;regarded, and would not be|lieve; that they &s;hould know them&s;elves, that ju&s;tice takes place upon them; that they &s;hould &s;ee and find, that GOD vindicates that maje&s;ty which they de&s;pi&s;|ed; that they &s;hould &s;ee that GOD is not &s;o de&s;pica|ble a being as they thought him to be; that they &s;hould be &s;en&s;ible, for what they are puni&s;hed, while they are under the threatened puni&s;hment; that they &s;hould be &s;en&s;ible of their own guilt, and &s;hould re|member their former opportunities and obligations, and &s;hould &s;ee their own folly and GOD'S ju&s;tice.&mdash;If the eternal puni&s;hment threatened be eternal anni|hilation,
<PB N="179" REF="016767_0175_0F9E17B9B3C5F7A0">
when it is inflicted, they will never know that it is inflicted; they will never know that GOD is ju&s;t in their puni&s;hment, or that they have their de|&s;erts. And how is this agreeable to the &s;cripture, in which GOD threatens that he will repay the wicked <HI>to his face,</HI> Deut. vii. 10? And to that in Job xxi. 19, 20. Speaking there of GOD'S puni&s;hing wicked men, it is &s;aid, <Q>GOD rewardeth him and he &s;hall know it; his eyes &s;hall &s;ee his de&s;truction, and he &s;hall drink of the wrath of the Almighty</Q>? And to that in Ezekiel xxii. 21, 22. <Q>Yea I will gather you, and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath, and ye &s;hall be melted in the mid&s;t thereof, as &s;ilver is melted in the mid&s;t of the furnace, &s;o &s;hall ye be melted in the mid&s;t thereof; and ye &s;hall <HI>know</HI> that I the LORD have poured out my fury upon you</Q>?&mdash;And how it is agreeable to that expre&s;|&s;ion &s;o often annexed to the threatenings of GOD'S wrath again&s;t wicked men, <HI>And ye &s;hall know that I am the Lord?</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. THE &s;cripture teaches that the wicked will &s;uf|fer different degrees of torment, according to the dif|ferent aggravations of their &s;ins. Mat. v. 22. <Q>Who|&s;oever is angry with his brother without a cau&s;e &s;hall be in danger of the judgment: and who&s;o|ever &s;hall &s;ay to his brother, Raca, &s;hall be in dan|ger of the council: but who&s;oever &s;hall &s;ay, Thou fool, &s;hall be in danger of hell-fire.</Q> Here CHRIST teaches us that the torments of wicked men will be different in different per&s;ons, according to the diffe|rent degrees of their guilt.&mdash;It &s;hall be more tole|rable for Sodom and Gomorrha, for Tyre and Sidon, than for the cities where mo&s;t of CHRIST'S mighty works were wrought.&mdash;Again, our LORD a&s;&s;ures <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">s, That he that knoweth his LORD'S will, and pre|pareth not him&s;elf, nor doth according to his will,
<PB N="180" REF="016767_0176_0F9E17BA233CEB78">
&s;hall be beaten with <HI>many</HI> &s;tripes. But he that know|eth not, and committeth things worthy of &s;tripes &s;hall be beaten with few &s;tripes.&mdash;The&s;e &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture infallibly prove that there will be diffe|rent degrees of puni&s;hment in hell; which is utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;uppo&s;ition, that that puni&s;hment con&s;i&s;ts in annihilation, in which there can be no de|grees, but is the &s;ame thing to every one who is the &s;ubject of it.</P>
<P N="4">4. The &s;criptures are very expre&s;s and abundant in this matter, that the eternal puni&s;hment of the wicked will con&s;i&s;t in &s;en&s;ible mi&s;ery and torment, and not in annihilation.&mdash;What is &s;aid of Judas is worthy to be ob&s;erved here, <Q>It had been good for that man, if he had not been born;</Q> Mat. xxvi. 24.&mdash;This &s;eems plainly to teach us that the puni&s;h|ment of the wicked is &s;uch that their exi&s;tence, upon the whole is wor&s;e than non-exi&s;tence. But if their puni&s;hment con&s;i&s;ts merely in annihilation, this is not true.&mdash;The wicked, in their puni&s;hment, are &s;aid to <HI>weep,</HI> and <HI>wail,</HI> and <HI>gn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;h their teeth;</HI> which implies not only real exi&s;tence, but life, knowledge and acti|vity, and that they are in a very &s;en&s;ible and exqui|&s;ite manner affected with their puni&s;hment.&mdash;In I&s;aiah xxxiii. 14, Sinners in the &s;tate of their puni&s;h|ment are repre&s;ented <HI>to dwell</HI> with everla&s;ting burnings. But if they are only turned into nothing, where is the foundation for this repre&s;entation? It is ab&s;urd to &s;ay that &s;inners will <HI>dwell</HI> with annihilation; for there is no <HI>dwelling</HI> in the ca&s;e. It is al&s;o ab&s;urd to call an|nihilation, a <HI>burning,</HI> which implies a &s;tate of exi&s;tence, &s;en&s;ibility and extreme pain; whereas in annihilation there is neither one nor another of the&s;e.&mdash;The &s;tate of the future puni&s;hment of the wicked is evi|dently repre&s;ented to be a &s;tate of exi&s;tence and &s;en|&s;ibility,

when it is &s;aid, that they &s;hall be ca&s;t into a lake of fire and brim&s;tone.

<P>THE &s;pirits of ungodly men before the re&s;urrection, are not in a &s;tate of annihilation, but in a &s;tate of mi|&s;ery; they are &s;pirits in pri&s;on, as the apo&s;tle &s;aith of them that were drowned in the flood; 1 Pet. iii. 19.&mdash;And this appears very plainly from the in|&s;tance of the rich man, before mentioned, if we con|&s;ider him as repre&s;enting the wicked in their &s;eperate &s;tate, between death and the re&s;urrection. But if the wicked even <HI>then,</HI> are in a &s;tate of <HI>torment,</HI> much more will they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e, when they &s;hall come to &s;uffer that which is the proper puni&s;hment of their &s;ins.</P>
<P>ANNIHILATION is not &s;o great a calamity but that &s;ome men have undoubtedly cho&s;en it, rather than &s;uch a &s;tate of &s;uffering, as they have been in, even in this life. This was the ca&s;e of Job, a good man. But if a good man in this world may &s;uffer that which is wor&s;e than annihilation; doubtle&s;s the proper pu|ni&s;hment of the wicked, in which GOD means to ma|nife&s;t his peculiar abhorrence of their wickedne&s;s, will be a calamity va&s;tly greater &s;till; and therefore can|not be annihilation. That mu&s;t be a very mean and contemptible te&s;timony of GOD'S wrath towards tho&s;e who have rebelled again&s;t his crown and dignity, have
<PB N="182" REF="016767_0178_0F9E17BBAF00E1F8">
broken his laws, and de&s;pi&s;ed both his vengeance and his grace, which is not &s;o great a calamity, as &s;ome of his true children have &s;uffered in life.</P>
<P>THE eternal puni&s;hment of the wicked is &s;aid to be the <HI>&s;econd death,</HI> once and again, as Rev. xx. 14. and xxi. 8.&mdash;It is doubtle&s;s called the &s;econd death in referrence to the death of the body; and as the death of the body is ordinarily attended with great pain and di&s;tre&s;s, &s;o the like, or &s;omething va&s;tly greater, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> implied to calling the eternal puni&s;hment of the wick|ed; the <HI>&s;econd death;</HI> and there would be no propri|ety in calling it to, if it con&s;i&s;ted merely in annihi|lation. And this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> death wicked men will &s;uf|fer; for it cannot be called the &s;econd death, with re&s;pect to any other than men; it cannot be called &s;o with re&s;pect to devils, as they die no temporal death, which is the fir&s;t death. In Rev&punc; ii. 11. <Q>It is &s;aid, He that overcometh, &s;hall not be hurt of the &s;e|cond death;</Q> implying that all who do not over|come their lu&s;ts, but live in &s;in, &s;hall &s;uffer the &s;econd death.</P>
<P>AGAIN, wicked men will &s;uffer the &s;ame kind of death with the devils; as in ver&s;e 25. of the context, <Q>Depart ye cur&s;ed into everla&s;ting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.</Q> Now the puni&s;hment of the devil is not annihilation, but torment: he therefore trembles for fear of it; not for fear of be|ing annihilated, he would be glad of that. What he is afraid of is torment, as appears by Luke viii. 28. Where he cries out and be&s;eeches CHRIST that he would not <HI>torment</HI> him before the time. And it is &s;aid, Rev. xx. 10. The devil that deceived them was ca&s;t into the lake of fire and brim&s;tone, where the bea&s;t and the fal&s;e prophet are, and &s;hall be <HI>tor|mented</HI> day and night, for ever and ever.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="016767_0179_0F9E17BCC7DF8C78">
IT is &s;trange how men will go directly again&s;t &s;o plain and full revelations of &s;cripture, as to &s;uppo&s;e, notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e things, that the eternal pu|ni&s;hment threatened again&s;t the wicked, &s;ignifies no more, than annihilation.</P>
<P>III. As the future puni&s;hment of the wicked con|&s;i&s;ts in &s;en&s;ible mi&s;ery; &s;o it &s;hall not only continue for a very long time, but &s;hall be ab&s;olutely without end.</P>
<P>OF tho&s;e who have held that the torments of hell are not ab&s;olutely eternal, there have been two &s;orts. (1.) Some &s;uppo&s;e that in the threatenings of ever|la&s;ting puni&s;hment, the terms u&s;ed, do not nece&s;&s;arily import a proper eternity, but only a very long dura|tion. (2.) Others &s;uppo&s;e that if they do import a proper eternity; yet we cannot nece&s;&s;arily conclude thence, that GOD will fulfil his threatenings.</P>
<P>Therefore I &s;hall,</P>
<P>FIRST, &s;how that the threatenings of eternal pu|ni&s;hment do very plainly and fully import a proper, ab&s;olute eternity, and not merely a long duration.</P>
<P>This appears,</P>
<P N="1">1. BECAUSE when the &s;cripture &s;peaks of the wick|ed's being &s;entenced to their puni&s;hment, at the time when all temporal things are come to an end, it then &s;peaks of it as everla&s;ting, as in the text and el&s;ewhere.&mdash;It is true that the term <HI>forever</HI> is not always in &s;cripture u&s;ed to &s;ignify eternity. Sometimes it means, as long as a man liveth. In this &s;en&s;e it is &s;aid, that the Hebrew &s;ervant, who cho&s;e to abide with his ma|&s;ter, &s;hould have his ear bored, and &s;hould &s;erve his ma&s;ter <HI>forever.</HI>&mdash;Sometimes it means, during the continuance of the &s;tate and church of the Jews. In this &s;en&s;e &s;everal laws which were peculiar to that church, and were to continue in force no longer than that
<PB N="184" REF="016767_0180_0F9E17BE136B9690">
church &s;hould la&s;t, are called <HI>&s;tatutes forever.</HI> See Exod. xxvii 21. Chap. xxviii. 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. &amp;c.&mdash;Some|times it means as long as the world &s;tands. So in Eccles. i. 4. One generation pa&s;&s;eth away, and ano|ther generation cometh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> but the earth abideth <HI>for|ever.</HI></P>
<P>AND this la&s;t is the longe&s;t temporal duration, that &s;uch a term is ever u&s;ed to &s;ignify. There is no in|&s;tance of u&s;ing &s;uch a term, for a longer duration, when it &s;ignifies a temporal duration: For the duration of the world is doubtle&s;s the longe&s;t of any of tho&s;e things, that are temporal, as its begin|ning was the earlie&s;t of any of the&s;e things, that are temporal. Therefore when the &s;cripture &s;peaks of things as being before the foundation of the world, it means that they exi&s;ted from eternity and before the beginning of time. So tho&s;e things which continue after the end of the world, are eternal things, and are after the end of time.&mdash;Doubtle&s;s when the tempo|ral world is at an end, there will be an end to tempo|ral things. When the time comes that heaven and earth are &s;haken and removed, tho&s;e things that re|main will be things that cannot be &s;haken, but will remain for ever, Heb. xii. 26, 27.&mdash;This vi&s;ible world contains all things that are &s;een and are tempo|ral; and therefore when that is at an end, there will be an end of all things that are temporal, and therefore the things that remain after that, will be eternal.</P>
<P>BUT the puni&s;hment of the wicked will not only remain after the end of the world, but is called ever|la&s;ting after that, as in the text, <Q>The&s;e &s;hall go away into everla&s;ting puni&s;hment.</Q> So in 2 Thes. i. 9, 10. <Q>Who &s;hall be puni&s;hed with ever|la&s;ting de&s;truction from the pre&s;ence of the LORD and from the glory of his power; when he &s;hall come to be glorified in his &s;aints.</Q> &amp;c.&mdash;Now
<PB N="185" REF="016767_0181_0F9E17BEA2337670">
what can be meant by a thing's being everla&s;ting, af|ter all temporal things are come to an end, but that it is ab&s;olutely without end?</P>
<P N="2">2. SUCH expre&s;&s;ions are u&s;ed to &s;et forth the du|ration of the puni&s;hment of the wicked, as are never u&s;ed in the &s;criptures of the New-Te&s;tament to &s;igni|fy any thing but a proper eternity. It is &s;aid not on|ly that that puni&s;hment &s;hall be forever, but <HI>for ever and ever.</HI> Rev. xiv. 11; <Q>The &s;moke of their tor|ment a&s;cendeth up <HI>for ever and ever.</HI></Q> Rev. xx. 10; <Q>&s;hall be tormented day and night, <HI>for ever and ever.</HI></Q>&mdash;Doubtle&s;s the New-Te&s;tament has &s;ome expre&s;|&s;ion to &s;ignify a proper eternity, of which it has &s;o often occa&s;ion to &s;peak. But it is ignorant of any higher expre&s;&s;ion than this: if this do not &s;ignify an ab&s;olute eternity, there is none that does.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE &s;cripture u&s;es the &s;ame way of &s;peaking to &s;et forth the eternity of the puni&s;hment of the wicked, that it u&s;es to &s;et forth the eternity of the happine&s;s of the righteous, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the eternity of GOD him&s;elf. Mat. xxv. 46. The&s;e &s;hall go away into <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> puni&s;hment: but the righteous into life <HI>eternal.</HI> The words <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> and <HI>eternal,</HI> in the ori|ginal, are the very &s;ame. Rev. xxii. 5. And they (the &s;aints) &s;hall reign <HI>for ever and ever.</HI> And the &s;cripture has no higher expre&s;&s;ion to &s;ignify the eter|nity o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> him&s;elf, than that of his being <HI>for ever and ever,</HI> as Rev. iv. 9. <Q>To him who &s;at on the throne, who liveth &s;o ever and ever,</Q> and in the 10th ver&s;e, and in ch. v. 14. and ch. x. 6. and ch. xv. 7.</P>
<P>AGAIN, the &s;cripture expre&s;&s;es GOD'S eternity by this, that it &s;hall be forever, after the world is come to an end; P&s;al. cii. Xxvi, 27. <Q>They &s;hall peri&s;h, but thou &s;halt endure: yea, all of them &s;hall wax old like a garment; as a ve&s;ture &s;halt thou change
<PB N="186" REF="016767_0182_0F9E17C0E69BCDE8">
them, and they &s;hall be changed. But thou art the &s;ame, and thy years &s;hall have no end.</Q></P>
<P N="4">4. THE &s;cripture &s;ays that wicked men &s;hall not be delivered, till they have paid the uttermo&s;t far|thing of their debt; Mat. v. 26. Nor till they have paid the la&s;t mite; Luke x 5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. i. e. the utmo&s;t that is de&s;erved, and all mercy is excluded by this ex|pre&s;&s;ion. But we have &s;hown that they de&s;erve an infinite, an endle&s;s puni&s;hment.</P>
<P N="5">5. THE &s;cripture &s;ays ab&s;olutely, that their pu|ni&s;hment &s;hall not have an end. Mark ix. 44. <Q>Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quench|ed.</Q> Now it will not do to &s;ay, That the mean|ing is, Their worm &s;hall live a great while, or that it &s;hall be a great while before their fire is quenched. If ever the time comes, that their worm &s;hall die; if ever there &s;hall be a quenching of the fire at all, then it is not true, that their worm dieth not, and that the fire is not quenched. For if there be a dying of the worm, and a quenching of the fire, let it be at what time it will, nearer or further off, it is equally contra|ry to &s;uch a regation, <HI>is dieth not, it is not quenched.</HI></P>
<P>SECONDLY. THERE are others who allow, that the expre&s;&s;ions of the threatenings, do denote a proper eternity, but then, they &s;ay, it doth not certainly fol|low that the puni&s;hment will really be eternal; be|cau&s;e, &s;ay they, GOD may threaten, and yet not fulfil his threatenings. Though they allow that the threa|tenings are po&s;itive, and peremptory, without any re|&s;erve, yet they &s;ay GOD is not obliged to fulfil ab&s;o|lute, po&s;itive threatenings, as he is, ab&s;olute promi&s;es. Becau&s;e in promi&s;es a right is conveyed, that the crea|ture, to whom the promi&s;es are made, will claim; but there is no danger of the creature's claiming any right by a threatening.&mdash;Therefore I am now to &s;how that what GOD has po&s;itively declared in this
<PB N="187" REF="016767_0183_0F9E17C21CE0AB70">
matter, does indeed make it certain, that it &s;hall be as he has declared. To this end I &s;hall mention two things;</P>
<P N="1">1. IT is &s;elfevidently contrary to the divine truth, po&s;itively to declare, any thing to be real, whether pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">, pre&s;ent, or to come, which GOD at the &s;ame time knows is not &s;o. Ab&s;olutely threatening that any thing &s;hall be, is the &s;ame as ab&s;olutely declaring, that it is to be. For any to &s;uppo&s;e that GOD ab&s;o|lutely declares that any thing will be, which he at the &s;ame time knows will not be, is bla&s;phemy, if there be any &s;uch thing as bla&s;phemy.</P>
<P>INDEED it is very true, that there is no obligation on GOD, ari&s;ing from the claim of the creature, as there is in promi&s;es. They &s;eem to reckon the wrong way, who &s;uppo&s;e the nece&s;&s;ity of the execution of the threatening, to ari&s;e from a proper obligation on GOD to the creature, to execute, con&s;equent on his threatening. For indeed the certainty of the execu|tion ari&s;es the other way; <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> on the obligation there was on the omni&s;cient GOD, in threatening, to con|form his threatening to what he knew would be fu|ture in execution. Though &s;trictly &s;peaking GOD is not properly obliged to the creature, to execute be|cau&s;e he has threatened; yet he was obliged not ab|&s;olutely to threaten if at the &s;ame time he knew, that he &s;hould not, or would not fulfil: becau&s;e this would not have been con&s;i&s;tent with his truth.&mdash;So that from the truth of GOD, there is an inviolable connec|tion between po&s;itive threatenings and execution. They that &s;uppo&s;e, that GOD ab&s;olutely threatened, or po&s;itively declared, that he would do, contrary to what he knew would come to pa&s;s, do therein &s;up|po&s;e that he ab&s;olutely threatened contrary to what he knew to be truth. And how any one can &s;peak
<PB N="188" REF="016767_0184_0F9E17C266471A50">
contrary to what he knows to be truth, in declaring, promi&s;ing, or threatening, or any other way, con&s;i&s;|tently with inviolable truth is inconceivable.</P>
<P>THREATENINGS are &s;ignifications of &s;omething; and if they are made con&s;i&s;tently with truth, they are true &s;ignifications, or &s;ignifications of truth, or &s;ignificati|ons of that which &s;hall be. If ab&s;olute threatenings are &s;ignifications of any thing, they are &s;ignifications of the futurity of the things threatened. But if the futurity of the things threatened, be not true and real, then how can the threatening be a true &s;ignification? And if GOD, in them, &s;peaks contrary to what he knows, and contrary to what he intends, how he can &s;peak true, is inconceivable.</P>
<P>ABSOLUTE threatenings are a kind of predictions; and though GOD is not properly obliged by any claim of our's, to fulfil predictions, unle&s;s they are of the nature of promi&s;es; yet it certainly would be contra|ry to truth, to predict and &s;ay &s;uch a thing would come to pa&s;s, which he knew at the &s;ame time, would not come to pa&s;s. Threatenings are declarations of &s;omething future, and they mu&s;t be declarations of future truth, if they are true declarations. It's be|ing future alters not the ca&s;e any more than if it were pre&s;ent. It is equally contrary to truth, to declare contrary to what, at the &s;ame time is known to be truth, whether it be of things pa&s;t, pre&s;ent, or to come: for all are alike to GOD.</P>
<P>BESIDE, we have often declarations in &s;cripture of the future eternal puni&s;hment of the wicked, in the proper form of predictions, and not in the form of threatenings. So in the text. The&s;e &s;hall go away into everla&s;ting puni&s;hment. So in tho&s;e frequent a&s;|&s;ertions of eternal puni&s;hment in the Revelation, &s;ome of which I have already quoted. The Revelation is a prophecy, and is &s;o called in the book it&s;elf; &s;o are tho&s;e

<PB N="189" REF="016767_0185_0F9E17C3349D0650">
declarations of eternal puni&s;hment.&mdash;The like de|clarations we have al&s;o in many other places of &s;crip|ture.</P>
<P N="2">2. The doctrine of tho&s;e who teach that it is not certain, that GOD will fulfil tho&s;e ab&s;olute threatening is bla&s;phemous another way; and that is, as GOD ac|cording to their &s;uppo&s;ition was obliged to make u&s;e of a fallacy to govern the world. They own that it is needful that men &s;hould apprehend them&s;elves lia|ble to an eternal puni&s;hment, that they might thereby be re&s;trained from &s;in, and that GOD has threatened &s;uch a puni&s;hment, for the very end that they might believe them&s;elves expo&s;ed to it. But what an un|worthy opinion does this convey of GOD and his go|vernment, of his infinite maje&s;ty, and wi&s;dom, and all-&s;ufficiency!&mdash;Be&s;ide, they &s;uppo&s;e that though GOD has made u&s;e of &s;uch a fallacy, yet it is not &s;uch an one but that they have detected him in it. Though GOD intended men &s;hould believe it to be certain, that &s;inners are liable to an eternal puni&s;hment; yet they &s;uppo&s;e, that they have been &s;o cunning as to find out that it is not certain. And &s;o that GOD hath not laid his de&s;ign &s;o deep, but that &s;uch cunning men as they can di&s;cern the cheat and defeat the de&s;ign: becau&s;e they have found out, that there is no nece&s;&s;ary con|nexion between the threatening of eternal puni&s;hment and the execution of that threatening.</P>
<P>CONSIDERING the&s;e things, is it not greatly to be wondered at, that the great archbi&s;hop <HI>Tillot&s;on,</HI> who has made &s;o great a figure among the new fa&s;hioned divines, &s;hould advance &s;uch an opinion as this?</P>
<P>BEFORE I conclude this head, it may be proper for me to an&s;wer an objection or two, that may ari&s;e in the mids of &s;ome.</P>
<P N="1">1. It may be here &s;aid, We have in&s;tances, where|in
<PB N="190" REF="016767_0186_0F9E17C3E329EC30">
GOD hath not fulfilled his threatenings; as his threatening to Adam and in him to mankind, that they &s;hould <HI>&s;urely</HI> die, if they &s;hould eat the forbidden fruit. I an&s;wer, It is not true that GOD did not ful|fil that threatening: he fulfilled it, and will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it in every jot and tittle.&mdash;When GOD &s;aid, <Q>Thou &s;halt &s;urely die,</Q> if we re&s;pect &s;piritual death, it was fulfilled in Adam's per&s;on in the day that he ate. GOD immediately took away his image, his holy &s;pi|rit, and original righteou&s;ne&s;s, which was the highe&s;t and be&s;t life of our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ts; and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y were im|mediately in a doleful &s;tate of &s;piritual death.</P>
<P>IF we re&s;pect temporal death, that was al&s;o fulfill|ed: he brought death upon him&s;elf and all his po&s;te|rity, and he virtually &s;uffered that death on that very day on which he ate. His body was brought into a corruptible, mortal and dying condition, and &s;o it continued till it was di&s;&s;olved.&mdash;If we look at e|ternal death, and indeed all that death, which was comprehended in the threatening, it was properly &s;peaking fulfilled in CHRIST. When GOD &s;aid to Adam, If thou ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;t, thou &s;halt die, he &s;pake not only to him, and of him per&s;onally; but the words re&s;pected mankind, Adam and his race, and doubtle&s;s were &s;o under&s;tood by him. His off&s;pring were to be looked upon as &s;inning in him, and &s;o &s;hould die with him. The words do as ju&s;tly allow of an mod|lation of death, as of &s;in; they are as well con&s;i&s;tent with dying in a &s;urety, as with &s;inning in one. There|fore the threatening is fulfilled in the death of CHRIST, the &s;urety.</P>
<P N="2">2. ANOTHER objection may ari&s;e from GOD'S threatening to Nineveh. He threatened that in for|ty days Nineveh &s;hould be de&s;troyed, which yet he did not fulfil.&mdash;I an&s;wer, that threatening could
<PB N="191" REF="016767_0187_0F9E17C4E7F8D190">
justly be looked upon no otherwise, than as conditi|onal. It was of the nature of a warning, and not of an absolute denunciation. Why was Jonah sent to the Ninevites, but to give them warning, that they might have opportunity to repent, reform, and avert the approaching destruction? GOD had no other de|sign or end in sending the prophet to them, but that they might be warned and tried by him, as GOD warn|ed the Israelites, and warned Judah and Jerusalem before their destruction. Therefore the prophets, together with their prophecies of approaching destruc|tion, joined earnest exhortations to repent and reform, that it might be averted.</P>
<P>No more could justly be understood to be certain|ly threatened, than that Nineveh should be destroyed in forty days <HI>continuing as it was.</HI> For it was for their wickedness that that destruction was threatened, and so the Ninevites took it. Therefore when the cause was removed, the effect ceased.&mdash;It was con|trary to GOD'S known manner, to threaten punish|ment and destruction for sin here in this world ab&s;o|lutely, so that it should come upon the persons threa|tened unavoidably, let them repent and reform and do what they would; agreeably to Jer. xviii. 7, 8. <Q>At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy it; if that nation against whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them.</Q>&mdash;So that all threatenings of this nature had a condition implied in them, according to the known and declared manner of GOD'S dealing. And the Ninevites did not take it as an ab&s;olute &s;entence or denunciation: if they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, they would have de&s;|paired of any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> by fasting and reformation.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="016767_0188_0F9E17C564B1B8F8">
BUT the threatenings of eternal wrath are po&s;itive and ab&s;olute There is nothing in the word of GOD, from which we can gather any condition. The only opportunity of e&s;caping is in this world; this is the only &s;tate of trial, wherein we have any offers of mer|cy, or there is any place for repentence.</P>
<P>IV. I SHALL mention &s;everal good and important ends, which will be obtained by the eternal puni&s;h|ment of the wicked.</P>
<P N="1">1. HEREBY GOD vindicates his injured maje&s;ty. Wherein &s;inners ca&s;t contempt upon it, and trample it in the du&s;t, GOD vindicates and honors it, and makes it appear, as it is indeed, infinite, by &s;howing that it is infinitely dreadful to contemn or offend it.</P>
<P N="2">2. GOD glorifies his ju&s;tice.&mdash;The glory of GOD is the greate&s;t good; it is that which is the chief end of the creation; it is a thing of greater importance than any thing el&s;e. But this is one way wherein GOD will glorify him&s;elf, as in the eternal de&s;truction of ungodly men, he will glorify his ju&s;tice. There|in he will appear as a ju&s;t governor of the world. The vindictive ju&s;tice of God will appear &s;trict, ex|act, awful and terrible, and therefore glorious.</P>
<P N="3">3. GOD hereby indirectly glorifies his grace on the ve&s;&s;els of mercy.&mdash;The &s;aints in heaven will be hold the torments of the damned: <Q>the &s;moke of their torment a&s;cendeth up for ever and ever.</Q> I&s;ai. lxvi. 24. <Q>And they &s;hall go forth and look upon the carca&s;es of the men, that have tran&s;gre&s;&s;|ed again&s;t me; for their worm &s;hall not die, neither &s;hall their fire be quenched, and they &s;hall be an abhorring unto all fle&s;h.</Q> And in Rev. xiv. 10. It is &s;aid, that they &s;hall be tormented in the pre&s;ence of the holy angels and in the pre&s;ence of the lamb.&mdash;So they will be tormented in the pre&s;ence al&s;o of the glorified &s;aints.</P>

HEREBY the &s;aints will be made the more &s;en&s;ible how great their &s;alvation is.

<P N="1">1. FROM what hath been &s;aid, we may learn the folly and madne&s;s of the greater part of mankind, in that for the &s;ake of pre&s;ent momentary gratification, they run the venture of enduring all the&s;e eternal tor|ments. They prefer a &s;mall plea&s;ure, or a little wealth, or a little earthly honor and greatne&s;s, which can la&s;t but for a moment, to an e&s;cape from this puni&s;hment.&mdash;If it be true that the torments of hell are eternal, what will it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, and lo&s;e his own &s;oul; or what &s;hall a man give in ex|change for his &s;oul? What is there in this world, which is not a trifle, and lighter than vanity, in com|pari&s;on with the&s;e eternal things?</P>
<P>How mad are men, who &s;o often hear of the&s;e things and pretend to believe them; who can live but a little while, a few years; who do not even ex|pect to live here longer than others of their &s;pecies, ordinarily do; and who yet are carele&s;s about what becomes of them&s;elves in another world, where there is no change and no end!&mdash;How mad are they, when they hear that if they go <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in &s;in, they &s;hall be eternally mi&s;erable, that they are not moved by it, but hear it with as much carele&s;&s;ne&s;s and coldne&s;s, as if they were no way concerned in the matter; when they know not but that it may be their ca&s;e, that they may be &s;uffering the&s;e torments before a week is at end, and that if it &s;hould be &s;o, it would be no &s;trange thing, no other than a common thing!</P>

How common a thing is it to &s;ee men, who are told from &s;abbath to &s;abbath of eternal mi&s;ery, and who are as mortal as other men, &s;o carele&s;s about it, that they &s;eem not to be at all re&s;trained by it from whatever their &s;ouls lu&s;t after! It is not half &s;o much their care, to e&s;cape eternal mi&s;ery, as it is to get money and land, and to be con&s;iderable in the world, and to gratify their &s;en&s;es. Their thoughts are much more exerci&s;ed about the&s;e things, and much more of their care and concern is about them. Eter|nal mi&s;ery, though they lie every day expo&s;ed to it, is a thing neglected, it is but now and then thought of, and then with a great deal of &s;tupidity, and not with concern enough to &s;tir them up to do any thing con&s;iderable in order to e&s;cape it.

<P>THUS you will &s;ee it to be among young and old. Multitudes of tho&s;e who are in youth, lead a carele&s;s life, taking little care about their &s;alvation.

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>JOHN, xiv. 27.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>Peace I leave with you, my Peace I give unto you I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> as the World giveth, give I unto you.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE words are a part of a mo&s;t affectionate and affecting di&s;cour&s;e that CHRIST had with his di&s;ciples, the &s;ame evening in which he was be|tray'd; knowing that he was to be crucified the next day. This di&s;cour&s;e begins with the 31&s;t ver&s;e of the xiii chapter, and is continued to the end of the xvi chap|ter. CHRIST began his di&s;cour&s;e, after he had par|took of the pa&s;&s;over with them, after he had in&s;titu|ted and admini&s;tered the &s;acrament of the &s;upper, and after Judas was gone out, and none were left but his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ue and faithful di&s;ciples; whom he now addre&s;&s;es as his dear children. This was the la&s;t di&s;cour&s;e that ever CHRIST had with them before his death. As it was his parting di&s;cour&s;e, and as it were his dying di&s;|cour&s;e, &s;o it is on many accounts the mo&s;t remarka|ble of all the di&s;cour&s;es of CHRIST, which we have recorded in our bibles.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="016767_0198_0F9E18F937A3FCF0">
IT is evident this di&s;cour&s;e made a deep impre&s;&s;ion on the minds of the di&s;ciples; and we may &s;uppo&s;e that it did &s;o, in a &s;pecial manner, on the mind of John the beloved di&s;ciple, who&s;e heart was e&s;pecially full of love to him, and who had ju&s;t then been lean|ing on his bo&s;om. In this di&s;cour&s;e CHRIST had told his dear di&s;ciples that he was going away, which fil|led them with &s;orrow and heavine&s;s. The words of the text are &s;ome of the words which CHRIST &s;aid to comfort them, and to relieve their &s;orrow. He &s;up|ports them with the promi&s;e of that peace which he would leave with them, and which they would have in him and with him, when he was gone.</P>
<P>THIS promi&s;e he delivers in three emphatical ex|pre&s;&s;ions which illu&s;trate one another. "Peace I leave with you." As much as to &s;ay, though I am going away, yet I will not take all comfort away with me. While I have been with you, I have been your &s;upport and comfort, and you have had peace in me, in the mid&s;t of the lo&s;&s;es you have &s;u&s;tained and troubles you have met with in this evil generation. This peace I will not take from you, but leave it with you with great advantage, and in a more full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>"My peace I give unto you." CHRIST by calling it <HI>his</HI> peace &s;ignifies two things.</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT it was his own, that which he had to give. It was the peculiar benefit that he had to be|&s;tow on his children; now he was about to die and leave the world as to his human pre&s;ence. Silver and gold he had none: for while in his e&s;tate of hu|miliation he was poor. The foxes had holes, and the birds of the air had ne&s;ts: but the &s;on of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> had not where to lay his head. Luke ix. 58. He had no earthly e&s;tate to leave to his di&s;ciples who were as it were his family: but he had peace to give them.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="203" REF="016767_0199_0F9E18F9A42ED140">
2. IT was his peace that he gave them; as it was the &s;ame kind of peace which he him&s;elf enjoyed. The &s;ame excellent and divine peace which he ever had in GOD; and which he was about to receive in his exal|ted &s;tate in a va&s;tly greater perfection and fullne&s;s: for the happine&s;s CHRIST gives to his people, is a partici|pation of his own happine&s;s: agreeable to what CHRIST &s;ays in this &s;ame dying di&s;cour&s;e of his, chapter xv. 11 <Q>The&s;e things have I &s;aid unto you that my joy might remain in you.</Q> And in his prayer that he made with his di&s;ciples at the conclu&s;ion of this di&s;|cour&s;e. Chapter xvii. 13. <Q>And now come I un|to thee, and the&s;e things I &s;peak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in them&s;elves.</Q> And ver&s;e 22. <Q>And the glory which thou gave&s;t me, I have given them.</Q></P>
<P>CHRIST here alludes to men's making their wills be|fore death. When parents are about to leave their children by death, they are wont in their la&s;t will and te&s;tament to give them their e&s;tate. That e&s;tate which they them&s;elves were wont to po&s;&s;e&s;s and enjoy. So it was with CHRIST when he was about to leave the world, with re&s;pect to the peace which he gave his di&s;ciples; only with this difference, that earthly pa|rents, when they die, though they leave the &s;ame e|&s;tate to their children which they them&s;elves heretofore enjoyed; yet when the children come to the full po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, they enjoy it no more; the parents do not enjoy it with their children. The time of the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of parents and children is not together. Whereas with re&s;pect to CHRIST'S peace he did not only po&s;&s;e&s;s it him&s;elf before his death, when he be|queathed it to his di&s;ciples; but al&s;o afterwards more fully: &s;o that they were received to po&s;&s;e&s;s it with him.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="016767_0200_0F9E18FA8F486E08">
THE third and la&s;t expre&s;&s;ion is, "<HI>not as the world giveth, give I unto you,</HI>" Whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> is as much as to &s;ay, my gifts and legacies, now I am going to leave the world, are not like tho&s;e which the rich and great men of the world are wont to leave to their heirs, when they die. They bequeath to their children their worldly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; and it may be, va&s;t trea&s;ures of &s;ilver and gold, and &s;ometimes an earthly kingdom. But the thing that I give you, is my peace, a va&s;tly different thing from what they are wont to give, and which cannot be obtained by all that they can be&s;tow, or their children inherit from them.</P>
<P>DOCTRINE. THAT peace which CHRIST, when he died, left as a legacy to all his true &s;aints, is very di|ver&s;e from all tho&s;e things, which the men of this world bequeath to their children, when they die.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. CHRIST at his death made over the ble&s;&s;ings of the new-covenant to believers, as it were in a will or te&s;tament.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. A GREAT ble&s;&s;ing that CHRIST made over to believers in this his te&s;tament was his peace.</ITEM>

<P>THE new covenant is repre&s;ented by the apo&s;tle as CHRIST'S la&s;t will and te&s;tament. Heb. ix. 15, 16, <Q>And for this cau&s;e he is mediator of the new te&s;ta|ment, that by means of death, for the redemption of the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions that were under the fir&s;t te&s;ta|ment, they which are called might receive the pro|mi&s;e of eternal inheritance. For where a te&s;tament is, there mu&s;t al&s;o of nece&s;&s;ity be the death of the te&s;ta|tor.</Q>

What men convey by their will or te&s;tament, is their own e&s;tate. So CHRIST in the new covenant conveys to believers his own inheritance, &s;o far as they are capable of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing and enjoying it. They have that eternal life given to them in their mea&s;ure, which CHRIST him&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es. They live in him, and with him, and by a participation of his life. <HI>Becau&s;e he lives they live al&s;o.</HI> They inherit his kinghom: the &s;ame kingdom which the father appointed unto him. Luke xxii. 29. <Q>And I appoint unto you a king|dom, as my father hath appointed unto me.</Q> They &s;hall reign on his throne, Rev. iii. 21. They have his glory given to them. John xvii. And becau&s;e all things are CHRIST'S, &s;o in CHRIST all things are al&s;o the &s;aints 1. Cor. iii. 21, 22.</P>
<P>MEN in their wills or te&s;taments, mo&s;t commonly give their e&s;tates to their children. So believers are in &s;cripture repre&s;ented as CHRIST'S children. Heb. ii. 13. <Q>Behold, I, and the children which GOD hath given me.</Q> Men mo&s;t commonly make their wills a lit|tle before their death: &s;o CHRIST did in a very &s;pecial and &s;olemn manner, make-over and confirm to his di&s;ciples the ble&s;&s;ings of the new covenant, on the even|ing before the day of his crucifixion, in that di&s;cour&s;e of which my text is a part. The promi&s;es of the new covenant were never &s;o particularly expre&s;&s;ed, and &s;o &s;olemnly given forth by CHRIST in all the time that he was upon earth, as in this di&s;cour&s;e. CHRIST pro|mi&s;es them man&s;ions in his fathers hou&s;e chapter xiv. 1, 2, 3. Here he promi&s;es them whatever ble&s;|&s;ings they &s;hould need and a&s;k in his name. Chapter xv. 7. xvi. 23, 24. Here he does more &s;olemnly and fully than any where el&s;e, give forth and confirm the promi&s;e of the HOLY SPIRIT, which is the &s;um of the
<PB N="206" REF="016767_0202_0F9E18FCC8597768">
ble&s;&s;ings of the covenant of grace. Chap. xiv. 16.&mdash;xvii. 26.&mdash;xv. 25.&mdash;xvi. 7. Here he promi&s;es them his own and his father's gracious pre&s;ence and favor. Chapter xiv. 18.&mdash;xix. 20, 21. Here he promi&s;es them peace in the text. Here he promi&s;es them his joy. Chapter xv. 11. Here he promi&s;es grace to bring forth holy fruits&mdash;Chapter xv. 11. And victory over the world. Chapter xvi. 33. And indeed there &s;eems to be no where el&s;e &s;o full and compleat an edition of the covenant of grace in the whole bible, as in this dying di&s;cour&s;e of CHRIST with his eleven true di&s;ci|ples.</P>
<P>THIS covenant between CHRIST and his children is like a will or te&s;tament al&s;o in this re&s;pect, that it be|comes effectual, and a way is made for putting it in execution no other way than by his death; as the a|po&s;tle ob&s;erves it is with a will or te&s;tament among men. For a te&s;tament is of force after men are dead, Heb. ix. 17. For though the covenant of grace in|deed was of force before the death of CHRIST, yet it was of force no other wi&s;e than by his death: &s;o that his death then did virtually intervene; being already undertaken and engaged. As a man's heirs come by the legacies bequeathed to them, no otherwi&s;e than by the death of the te&s;tator, &s;o men come by the &s;pi|ritual and eternal inheritance, no otherwi&s;e than by the death of CHRIST. If it had not been for the death of CHRIST they never could have obtained it.</P>
<P>II. A GREAT ble&s;&s;ing that CHRIST in his te&s;tament hath bequeathed to his true followers is his peace. Here are two things that I would ob&s;erve particular|ly, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> That CHRIST hath bequeathed to believers <HI>true</HI> peace; and then that the peace he has given them is <HI>his</HI> peace.</P>
<P N="1">1. OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST has bequeathed true
<PB N="207" REF="016767_0203_0F9E18FED84852E8">
peace and comfort to his followers. CHRIST is called the prince of peace. I&s;ai ix. 6. And when he was born into the world, the angels on that joyful and wonderful occa&s;ion &s;ang glory to GOD in the highe&s;t, on earth <HI>peace;</HI> becau&s;e of that peace which he &s;hould procure for and be&s;tow on the children of men; Peace with GOD, and peace one with another, and tranquility and peace within them&s;elves which la&s;t is e&s;pecially the benefit &s;poken of in the text. This CHRIST has procured for his followers and laid a foundation for their enjoyment of, in that he has pro|cured for them the other two, <ABBR>viz,</ABBR> peace with GOD, and one with another. He has procured for them peace and reconciliation with GOD and his favor and friend&s;hip; in that he &s;atisfied for their &s;ins, and laid a foundation for the perfect removal of the guilt of &s;in, and the forgivene&s;s of all their tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, and wrought out for them a perfect and glorious righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, mo&s;t acceptable to GOD and &s;ufficient to re|commend them to GOD'S full acceptance and to the adoption of children, and to the eternal fruits of his fatherly kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>BY the&s;e means true &s;aints are brought into a &s;tate of freedom from condemnation, and all the cur&s;es of the law of GOD. Rom. viii. 34. <Q>Who is he that condemneth</Q>? And by the&s;e means they are &s;afe from that dreadful and eternal mi&s;ery which natural|ly they are expo&s;ed to, and are &s;et on high out of the reach of all their enemies, &s;o that the gates of hell and powers of darkne&s;s can never de&s;troy them; nor can wicked men, tho' they may per&s;ecute them, ever hurt them. Rom. viii. 31. <Q>If GOD be for us, who can be again&s;t us?</Q> Num. xxiii, 8. <Q>How &s;hall I cur&s;e whom GOD hath not cur&s;ed.</Q> ver&s;e 23. <Q>There is no enchantment again&s;t Jacob, neither is there
<PB N="208" REF="016767_0204_0F9E18FF57D72E10">
any divination again&s;t I&s;rael.</Q> By the&s;e means they are out of reach of death, John. vi, 4&mdash;ix, 50, 51. <Q>This is the bread which cometh down from hea|ven, that a man may eat thereof and not die.</Q> By the&s;e means death with re&s;pect to them has lo&s;t its &s;ting, and is no more worthy of the name of death 1 Cor. xv. 55. "O death where is thy &s;ting"? By the&s;e means they have no need to be afraid of the day of judgment when the heavens and earth &s;hall be di&s;&s;olved. Ps. xlvi. 1, 2. <Q>GOD is our refuge and &s;trength, a very pre&s;ent help in trouble. There|fore will not we fear though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the mid&s;t of the &s;ea.</Q> Yea a true &s;aint has rea&s;on to be at re&s;t in an a&s;&s;urance, that nothing can &s;eparate him from the love of GOD. Rom. viii. 38, 39.</P>
<P>THUS he that is got into CHRIST is in a &s;afe refuge from every thing that might di&s;turb him; for this is that man &s;poken of I&s;a. xxxii, 2. <Q>And a man &s;hall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempe&s;t, as rivers of water in a dry place; as the &s;hadow of a great rock in a weary land.</Q> And hence they that dwell in CHRIST have that pro|mi&s;e fulfilled to them which we have in the 18th ver&s;e of the &s;ame chapter; <Q>And my people &s;hall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in &s;ure dwellings, and in quiet re&s;ting places.</Q></P>
<P>AND the true followers of CHRIST have not only ground of re&s;t and peace of &s;oul by rea&s;on of their &s;afety from evil, but on account of their &s;ure title and certain enjoyment of all that good which they &s;tand in need of, living, dying and throughout all eternity. They are on a &s;ure foundation for happine&s;s, are built on a rock that can never be moved, and have a foun|tain that is &s;ufficient and can never be exhau&s;ted.
<PB N="209" REF="016767_0205_0F9E1900EB7A4790">
The covenant is order'd in all things and &s;ure, and GOD has pa&s;&s;ed his word and oath, <Q>that by two, immutable things, in which it was impo&s;&s;ible for GOD to lie, we might have &s;trong con&s;olation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope &s;et be|fore us.</Q> The infinite Jehovah is become their GOD, who can do every thing for them. He is their portion who has an infinite fulne&s;s of good in him|&s;elf. <Q>He is their &s;hield and exceeding great re|ward.</Q> As great a good is made over to them as they de&s;ire or can de&s;ire or conceive of; yea as great and as &s;weet as they are capable of; and to be conti|nued as long as they de&s;ire; and this is made as &s;ure as they can de&s;ire: Therefore they have rea&s;on to put their hearts at re&s;t, and be at peace in their minds.</P>
<P>BESIDES he has bequeathed peace to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of his people, as he has procured for them and made over to them, the &s;pirit of grace and true holine&s;s; which has a natural tendency to the peace and quietne&s;s of the &s;oul. It has &s;uch a tendency as it implies a di&s;co|very and reli&s;h of a &s;uitable and &s;ufficient good. It brings a per&s;on into a view of divine beauty and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o a reli&s;h of that good which is a man's proper happine&s;s; and &s;o it brings the &s;oul to its true centre? The &s;oul by this means is brought to re&s;t, and cea&s;es from re&s;t|le&s;sly inquiring; as others do, who will &s;hew us any good; and wandering to and fro like lo&s;t &s;heep &s;eek|ing re&s;t and finding none. The &s;oul hath found him who is as the apple tree among the trees of the wood, and &s;its down under his &s;hadow with great delight and his fruit is &s;weet unto his ta&s;te. Cant. ii. 2. And thus is that &s;aying of CHRIST fulfilled. John iv. 14. "Who&s;oever drinketh of the water that I &s;hall give him &s;hall never thir&s;t." And be&s;ides true grace naturally tends to peace and quietne&s;s as it &s;ettles things in the
<PB N="210" REF="016767_0206_0F9E190120DEA858">
&s;oul in their due order, &s;ets rea&s;on on the throne and &s;ubjects the &s;en&s;es and affections to its government, which before were uppermo&s;t and put all things into confu&s;ion and uproar in the &s;oul. Grace tends to tranquility as it mortifies tumultuous de&s;ires and pa&s;&s;ions, &s;ubdues the eager and in&s;atiable appetites of the &s;en&s;ual nature and greedine&s;s after the vanities of the world. It mortifies &s;uch principles as hatred, variance, emulation, wrath envyings and the like, which are a continual &s;ource of inward unea&s;ine&s;s and perturbation; and &s;upplies tho&s;e &s;weet, calming and quieting principles of humility, meekne&s;s, re&s;ig|nation, patience, gentlene&s;s, forgivene&s;s, and &s;weet reliance on GOD. It al&s;o tends to peace as it fixes the aim of the &s;oul to a certain end; &s;o that the &s;oul is no longer di&s;tracted and drawn contrary ways by oppo&s;ite ends to be &s;ought, and oppo&s;ite portions to be obtained, and many ma&s;ters of contrary wills and commands to be &s;erved; but the heart is fixed in the choice of one certain, &s;ufficient and unfailing good: and the &s;oul's aim at this, and hope of it, is like an anchor to it, that keeps it &s;tedfa&s;t that it &s;hould no more be driven to and fro by every wind.</P>
<P N="2">2. THIS peace which CHRIST has left as a legacy to his true followers, is <HI>his</HI> peace. It is the peace which him&s;elf enjoys. This is what I take to be that which is principally intended in the expre&s;&s;ion. It is the peace that he enjoyed while on earth, in his &s;tate of humiliation; though he was a man of &s;orrows and acquainted with grief, and was every where ha|ted and per&s;ecuted by men and devils, and had no place of re&s;t in this world; yet in GOD his father he had peace. We read of his rejoicing in &s;pirit, Luke x. 21. SO CHRIST'S true di&s;ciples, though in the world they have tribulation, yet in GOD have peace.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="016767_0207_0F9E190475864158">
WHEN CHRIST had fini&s;hed his labours and &s;uf|ferings and ro&s;e from the dead, and a&s;cended into heaven; then he entered into his re&s;t, and into a &s;tate of mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed perfect and everla&s;ting peace: deliv|ered by his own &s;ufferings from our imputed guilt, acquitted and ju&s;tified of the father on his re&s;urrecti|on; having obtained a perfect victory over all his enemies; was received of his father into heaven, the re&s;t which he had prepared for him, there to enjoy his hearts de&s;ire fully and perfectly to all eternity. And then were tho&s;e words in the &s;ix fir&s;t ver&s;es of the 21&s;t P&s;alm, which have re&s;pect to CHRIST, fulfilled. This peace and re&s;t of the Me&s;&s;iah is doubtle&s;s exceed|ing glorious. I&s;ai. xi. 10. <Q>And his re&s;t &s;hall be glo|rious.</Q> This re&s;t is what CHRIST has procured not only for him&s;elf, but al&s;o his people, by his death; and has bequeathed it to them that they may enjoy it with him, imperfectly in this world and perfectly and eternally in another world.</P>
<P>THAT peace, which has been de&s;cribed, which be|lievers enjoy, is a participation of the peace which their glorious Lord and ma&s;ter him&s;elf enjoys, by virtue of the &s;ame blood of CHRIST, by which CHRIST him&s;elf has entered into re&s;t; it is in a participation of this &s;ame ju&s;tification: for believers are ju&s;tified with CHRIST. As he was ju&s;tified when he ro&s;e from the dead, and as he was made free from our guilt which he had as our &s;urety; &s;o believers are ju&s;tified in him and through him. It is as being accepted of GOD in the &s;ame righteou&s;ne&s;s: It is in the favour of the &s;ame GOD and heavenly father, that they enjoy peace. <Q>I a&s;cend to my father and your father, to my GOD and your GOD.</Q> It is in a participation of the &s;ame &s;pirit; for believers have the &s;pirit of CHRIST. He had the &s;pirit given to him not by
<PB N="212" REF="016767_0208_0F9E1905CDB22250">
mea&s;ure, and of his fulne&s;s do they all receive and grace for grace. As the oil poured on the head of Aaron went down to the &s;kirts of his garments, &s;o the &s;pirit poured on CHRIST the head, de&s;cends to all his members. It is as partaking of the &s;ame grace of the &s;pirit, that believers enjoy this peace; John i. 16.</P>
<P>IT is as being united to CHRIST and living by a participation of his life, as a branch lives by the life of the vine. It is as partaking of the &s;ame love of GOD; John xvii. 26. <Q>That the love wherewith thou ha&s;t loved me may be in them.</Q>&mdash;It is as having a part with him in his victory over the &s;ame enemies: and al&s;o as having an intere&s;t in the &s;ame kind of eternal re&s;t and peace. Eph. ii. 5, 6. <Q>Even when we were dead in &s;ins, hath quickened us to|gether with CHRIST,&mdash;and hath rai&s;ed us up to|gether, and hath made us &s;it together in heavenly places.</Q></P>
<P>III. THIS legacy of CHRIST to his true di&s;ciples, is very diver&s;e from all that the men of this world ever leave to their children, when they die. The men of this world, many of them, when they come to die, have great e&s;tates to bequeath to their chil|dren, an abundance of the good things of this world, large <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of ground perhaps in a fruitful &s;oil, co|vered with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">. They &s;ometimes leave to their children fra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and va&s;t trea&s;ures of &s;ilver, gold, jewels and precious things, fetched from both the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and from every &s;ide of the globe of the earth. They leave them wherewith to live in much &s;tate and magnificence and make a great &s;how among men, to fare very &s;umptuou&s;ly and &s;wim in worldly plea&s;ures. Some have crowns, &s;cep|ters and palaces, and great monarchies to leave to their heirs. But none of the&s;e things are to be com|pared
<PB N="213" REF="016767_0209_0F9E190678628E18">
to that ble&s;&s;ed peace of CHRIST which he has bequeathed to his true followers. The&s;e things are &s;uch as GOD commonly in his providence gives his wor&s;t enemies, tho&s;e whom he hates and de&s;pi&s;es mo&s;t. But CHRIST'S peace is a precious benefit which he re&s;erves for his peculiar favourites The&s;e worldly things, even the be&s;t of them, that the men and prin|ces of the world leave for their children, are things which GOD in his providence throws out to tho&s;e whom he looks on as dogs, but CHRIST'S peace is the bread of his children. All the&s;e earthly things are but empty &s;hadows, which however men &s;et their hearts upon them, are not bread and never can &s;atis|fy their &s;ouls; but this peace of CHRIST is a truly &s;ub&s;tantial &s;atisfying food. I&s;ai. lv. 2. None of tho&s;e things, if men have them to the be&s;t advantage and in ever &s;o great abundance, can give true peace and re&s;t to the &s;oul, as is abundantly manife&s;t not only in rea&s;on, but experience; it being found in all ages that tho&s;e who have the mo&s;t of them, have common|ly the lea&s;t quietne&s;s of mind. It is true there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> be a kind of quietne&s;s, a fal&s;e peace they may have in their enjoyment of worldly things; men may ble&s;s their &s;ouls and think them&s;elves the only happy per|&s;ons and de&s;pi&s;e others; may &s;ay to their &s;ouls, as the rich man did, Luke xii. 19. <Q>Soul, thou ha&s;t much goods laid up for many years, take thine ea&s;e, eat, drink and be merry.</Q> But CHRIST'S peace which he gives to his true di&s;ciples, va&s;tly dif|fers from this peace, that men may have in the enjoy|ments of the world, in the following re&s;pects:</P>
<P N="1">1. CHRIST'S peace is a rea&s;onable peace and re&s;t of &s;oul; it is what has its foundation in light and knowledge in the proper exerci&s;es of rea&s;on, and a right view of things; whereas the peace of the world
<PB N="214" REF="016767_0210_0F9E1907B73D7EA8">
is founded in blindne&s;s and delu&s;ion. The peace that the people of CHRIST have, ari&s;es from their hav|ing their eyes open and &s;eeing things as they be. The more they con&s;ider, and the more they know of the truth and reality of things; the more they know what is true concerning them&s;elves, the &s;tate and con|dition they are in; the more they know of GOD, and the more certain they are that there is a GOD, and the more they know what manner of being he is; the more certain they are of another world and future judgment, and of the truth of GOD'S threatnings and promi&s;es; the more their con&s;ciences are awakened and enlightened, and the brighter and the more &s;earch|ing the light is that they &s;ee things in; the more is their peace e&s;tabli&s;hed. Whereas on the contrary the peace that the men of the world have in their worldly enjoyments, can &s;ub&s;i&s;t no otherwi&s;e, than by their being kept in ignorance. They mu&s;t be blind|folded and deceived, otherwi&s;e, they can have no peace: do but let light in upon their con&s;ciences, &s;o that they may look about them and &s;ee what they are, and what circum&s;tances they are in, and it will at once de&s;troy all their quietne&s;s and comfort. Their peace can live no where but in the dark. Light turns their ea&s;e into torment. The more they know what is true concerning GOD and concerning them|&s;elves, the more they are &s;en&s;ible of the truth con|cerning tho&s;e enjoyments which they po&s;&s;e&s;s, and the more they are &s;en&s;ible what things now are, and what things are like to be hereafter; the more will their calm be turned into a &s;torm. The worldly man's peace can't be maintained but by avoiding con&s;idera|tion and reflection. If he allows him&s;elf to think and properly to exerci&s;e his rea&s;on, it de&s;troys his quietne&s;s and comfort. If he would e&s;tabli&s;h his
<PB N="215" REF="016767_0211_0F9E1907E124E8B8">
carnal peace it concerns him to put out the light of his mind, and turn bea&s;t as fa&s;t as he can. The fa|culty of rea&s;on if at liberty, proves a mortal enemy to his peace. It concerns him, if he would keep a|live his peace, to continue all ways that may be, to &s;tupify his mind and deceive him&s;elf, and to imagine things to be otherwi&s;e than they be. But with re&s;|pect to the peace which CHRIST gives, rea&s;on is its great friend. The more this faculty is exerci&s;ed, the more it is e&s;tabli&s;hed. The more they con&s;ider and view things with truth and exactne&s;s, the firmer is their comfort and the higher their joy. How va&s;t a difference is there between the peace of a chri&s;tian and the wordling! How mi&s;erable are they who can't enjoy peace any otherwi&s;e than by hiding their eyes from the light and confining them&s;elves to darkne&s;s; who&s;e peace is properly &s;tupidity; as the ea&s;e that a man has, who has taken a do&s;e of &s;tupifying poi&s;on, and the ea&s;e and plea&s;ure that a drunkard may have, in an hou&s;e on fire over his head, or the joy of a di&s;tracted man in thinking that he is a king, though a mi&s;erable wretch confined in Bedlam. Whereas the peace that CHRIST gives his true di&s;ciples is the light of life, &s;omething of the tranquility of heaven, the peace of the cele&s;tial paradi&s;e that has the glory of GOD to lighten it.</P>
<P N="2">2. CHRIST'S peace is a virtuous and holy peace. The peace that the men of the world enjoy is vicious; it is a vile &s;tupidity that depraves and deba&s;es the mind and makes men bruti&s;h. But the peace that the &s;aints enjoy in CHRIST, is not only their comfort, but it is a part of their beauty and dignity. The chri&s;tian tranquility, re&s;t and joy of real &s;aints, are not only un&s;peakable privileges, but they are virtues and graces of GOD'S &s;pirit, wherein the image of GOD
<PB N="216" REF="016767_0212_0F9E1908D4A47838">
in them does partly con&s;i&s;t. This peace has its &s;ource in tho&s;e principles that are in the highe&s;t degree vir|tuous and amiable, &s;uch as poverty of &s;pirit, holy re&s;ignation, tru&s;t in GOD, divine love, meekne&s;s and charity. The exerci&s;e of &s;uch ble&s;&s;ed fruits of the &s;pirit as are &s;poken of Gal. v. 22, 23.</P>
<P N="3">3. THIS peace greatly differs from that which is enjoyed by the men of the world, with regard to its exqui&s;ite &s;weetne&s;s. It is a peace that pa&s;&s;es all that natural men enjoy in worldly things &s;o much that it pa&s;&s;es their under&s;tanding and conception. Phil. iv. 7. It is exqui&s;itely &s;weet; becau&s;e it has &s;o firm a foun|dation as the everla&s;ting rock that never can be mov|ed. It is &s;weet, becau&s;e perfectly agreeable to rea&s;on: It is &s;weet, becau&s;e it ri&s;es from holy and divine principles, that as they are the virtue &s;o they are the proper happine&s;s of men.</P>
<P>IT is exqui&s;itely &s;weet becau&s;e of the greatne&s;s of the objective good that the &s;aints enjoy, and have peace and re&s;t in, being no other than the infinite bounty and fullne&s;s of that GOD, who is the fountain of all good. It is &s;weet on account of the fullne&s;s and perfection of that provi&s;ion that is made for it in CHRIST and the new covenant, where there is a foundation laid for the &s;aints perfect peace; and hereafter they &s;hall actually enjoy perfect peace; and though their peace is not now perfect, it is not ow|ing to any defect in the provi&s;ion made, but in their own imperfection and mi&s;ery, &s;in and darkne&s;s; and becau&s;e as yet they do partly cleave to the world and &s;eek peace from thence, and don't perfectly cleave to CHRIST. But the more they do &s;o, and the more they &s;ee of the provi&s;ion there is made, and accept of it, and cleave to that alone, the nearer are they brought to perfect tranquility.

4. THE peace of the chri&s;tian infinitely differs from that of the worldling, in that it is unfailing and eter|nal peace. That peace which carnal men have in the things of the world, is according to the founda|tion it is built upon, of &s;hort continuance; like the comfort of a dream. 1 Joh. ii. 17. 1 Cor. vii. 31. The&s;e things, the be&s;t and mo&s;t durable of them, are like bubbles on the face of the water; then vani&s;h in a moment. Hos. x. 7.</P>

The fountain of his comfort &s;hall never be dimini&s;hed, and the &s;tream &s;hall never be dried.

As long as you continue to reject tho&s;e offers and invitations of CHRIST and continue in a chri&s;tle&s;s condition, you never will enjoy any true peace or comfort; but in whatever circum&s;tances you are, you will be mi&s;erable; you will be like the prodigal that in vain endeavored to fill his belly with the hu&s;ks that the &s;wine did eat: the wrath of GOD will abide upon and mi&s;ery will attend you wherever you go, which you never will by any means be able to e&s;cape. CHRIST gives peace to the mo&s;t &s;inful and mi&s;erable that come to him. He heals the broken in heart and bindeth up their wounds.

When you are in the enjoyment of things that are the mo&s;t plea&s;ing to you, where your heart is be&s;t &s;uited, and mo&s;t chearful, yet you are in a &s;tate of condemnation, hanging over the infernal pit, with the &s;word of di|vine vengeance hanging over your head, having no &s;ecurity one moment from utter and remedile&s;s de&s;|truction.

<Q><HI>Now concerning the collection for the &s;aints, as I have gi|ven order to the churches of Golalia, even &s;o do ye. Upon the fir&s;t day of the week, let every one of you lay by him in &s;tore, as God hath pro&s;pered him, that there be no gatherings when I come.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WE find in the new te&s;tament often mentioned a certain collection, which was made by the Grecian churches, for the brethren in Judea, who were reduced to p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ching want by a dearth which then prevailed, and was the heavier upon them by rea&s;on of their circum&s;tances, they having been from the beginning oppre&s;&s;ed and per&s;ecuted by the unbe|lieving Jews.&mdash;We have this collection or contribution twice mentioned in the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> as in Chap. xi. 28&mdash;31; and in Chap. xxiv. 17. It is al&s;o taken notice of in &s;everal of the epi&s;tles; as Rom. xv. 26. and Gal. ii. 10. But it is mo&s;t largely in&s;i&s;ted on, in the&s;e two epi&s;tles to the Corinthians; in this fir&s;t epi&s;tle, chapter xvi. and in the &s;econd epi&s;tle chapter viii and ix.&mdash;The
<PB N="222" REF="016767_0218_0F9E190D5EA9AF88">
apo&s;tle begins the directions, which in this place he delivers concerning this matter, with the words of the text;&mdash;wherein we may ob&s;erve</P>
<P N="1">1. WHAT is the thing to be done concerning which the apo&s;tle gives them direction, and that is the making of a collection for the &s;aints; the exerci&s;e and manife&s;tation of their charity towards their bre|thren, by communicating to them, for the &s;upply of their wants; which was by CHRIST and his apo&s;tles often &s;poken of and in&s;i&s;ted on, as one main duty of the chri&s;tian religion, and is expre&s;sly declared to be &s;o, by the apo&s;tle James, chapter i. 27. <Q>Pure religion and undefiled before GOD and the father is this, to vi&s;it the fatherle&s;s and widows in their afflic|tion.</Q></P>
<P N="2">2. WE may ob&s;erve the time on which the apo&s;|tle directs that this &s;hould be done, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <Q>on the fir&s;t day of the week.</Q> By the in&s;piration of the Holy Gho&s;t he in&s;i&s;ts upon it, that it be done on &s;uch a particular day of the week, as if no other day would do &s;o well as that, or were &s;o proper and fit a time for &s;uch a work.&mdash;Thus, although the in&s;pir|ed apo&s;tle was not for making that di&s;tinction of days in go&s;pel times, which the Jews made, as ap|pears by Gal. iv. 10. <Q>Ye ob&s;erve days, and months, and times, and years: I am afraid of you, le&s;t I have be&s;towed upon you labour in vain;</Q> yet here he gives the preference to one day of the week, before any other, for the performance of a certain great duty of chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P N="3">3. IT may be ob&s;erved that this is the direction, which the apo&s;tle had given to other churches that were concerned in the &s;ame duty, upon this occa&s;ion: he had given direction to them al&s;o to do it on the fir&s;t day of the week: <Q>As I have given orders to the churches of Galatia, even &s;o do ye.</Q> Whence
<PB N="223" REF="016767_0219_0F9E190F60EC92D8">
we may learn that it was nothing peculiar in the cir|cum&s;tances of the Corinthians at Corinth, which was the rea&s;on why the Holy Gho&s;t in&s;i&s;ted, that they &s;hould perform this duty on this day of the week. The apo&s;tle had given the like order to the churches of <HI>Galatia.</HI></P>
<P>NOW Galatia was far di&s;tant from Corinth; the &s;ea parted them; and be&s;ides that, there were &s;everal other countries between them. Therefore it cannot be thought that the Holy Gho&s;t directs them to this time upon any &s;ecular account, having re&s;pect to &s;ome particular circum&s;tances of the people in that city; but upon a religious account. In giving the preference to this day for &s;uch work, before any o|ther day, he has re&s;pect to &s;ome thing which reached all chri&s;tians throughout the wide world.</P>
<P>AND by other pa&s;&s;ages of the new te&s;tament, we learn that the ca&s;e was the &s;ame as to other exerci&s;es of religion; and that in the age of the apo&s;tles, the fir&s;t day of the week was preferred before any other day, among the primitive chri&s;tians and in churches immediately under the care of the apo&s;tles, for an attendance on the exerci&s;es of religion in general. Acts xx. 7. <Q>Upon the fir&s;t day of the week, when the di&s;ciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them.</Q>&mdash;It &s;eems by the&s;e things to have been among the primitive chri&s;tians in the apo&s;tles days, with re&s;pect to the fir&s;t day of the week, as it was among the Jews, with re&s;pect to the &s;eventh.</P>
<P>WE are taught by CHRIST, that the doing of alms and &s;howing of mercy are proper works for the &s;ab|bath day. When the Phari&s;ees found fault with CHRIST for &s;uffering his di&s;ciples to pluck the ears of corn and eat on the &s;abbath. CHRIST corrects
<PB N="224" REF="016767_0220_0F9E191487587288">
them with that, <Q>I will have mercy and not &s;acri|fice;</Q> Mat. xii. 7. And CHRIST teaches that works of mercy are proper to be done on the &s;abbath, in Luke xiii. 15, 16. and xiv. 5.&mdash;The&s;e works u&s;ed to be done on &s;acred fe&s;tivals and days of re|joicing, under the old te&s;tament, as in Nehemiah's and E&s;ther's time; Neh. viii. 10. and E&s;th. ix. 19, 22.&mdash;And <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> and <HI>Philo,</HI> two very noted Jews, who wrote not long after CHRIST'S time, give an account that it was the manner among the Jews on the &s;abbath, to make collections for &s;acred and pious u&s;es.</P>
<P>DOCTRINE. IT is the mind and will of GOD, that the fir&s;t day of the week &s;hould be e&s;pecially &s;et a|part among chri&s;tians, for religious exerci&s;es and duties.</P>
<P>THAT this is the doctrine which the Holy Gho&s;t intended to teach us, by this and from other pa&s;&s;ages of the new te&s;tament, I hope will appear plainly by the &s;equel. This is a doctrine that we have been generally brought up in by the in&s;tructions and ex|amples of our ance&s;tors; and it is and has been the general profe&s;&s;ion of the chri&s;tian world, that this day ought to be religiou&s;ly ob&s;erved and di&s;tingui&s;hed from other days of the week. However &s;ome deny it. Some refu&s;e to take any notice of the day, or any way to difference it from other days. Others own that it is a laudable cu&s;tom of the chri&s;tian church, into which &s;he fell by agreement, and by appointment of her ordinary rulers, to &s;et apart this day for public wor&s;hip. But they deny any other original to &s;uch an ob&s;ervation of the day, than pru|dential human appointment.&mdash;Others religiou&s;ly ob&s;erve the Jewi&s;h &s;abbath, &s;uppo&s;e that the in&s;titu|tion of that is of perpetual obligation, and that we
<PB N="225" REF="016767_0221_0F9E1915B1FB2A80">
want foundation for determining that that is abroga|ted, and another day of the week is appointed in the room of the &s;eventh.</P>
<P>ALL the&s;e cla&s;&s;es of men &s;ay, that there is no clear, revelation that it is the mind and will of GOD, that the fir&s;t day of the week &s;hould be ob&s;erved as a day to be &s;et apart for religious exerci&s;es, in the room of the antient &s;abbath; which there ought to be, in order to the ob&s;ervation of it by the chri&s;tian church, as a di|vine in&s;titution. They &s;ay, that we ought not to go upon the tradition of pa&s;t ages, or upon uncertain and far fetched inferences from &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages of the hi&s;tory of the new te&s;tament, or upon &s;ome ob&s;cure and uncertain hints in the apo&s;tles writings; but that we ought to expect a plain in&s;titution; which they &s;ay, we may conclude GOD would have give us, if he had de&s;igned that the whole chri&s;tian church, in all ages, &s;hould ob&s;erve another day of the week for an holy &s;abbath, than that which was appointed of old, by plain and po&s;itive in&s;titution.</P>
<P>SO far is undoubtedly true, that if this be the mind and will of GOD, he hath not left the matter to human tradition; but hath &s;o revealed his mind about it, in his word, that there is there to be found good and &s;ub&s;tantial evidence that it is his mind: and doubtle&s;s, the revelation is plain enough for them that have ears to hear; that is, for them that will ju&s;tly exerci&s;e their under&s;tandings about what GOD &s;ays to them. No chri&s;tian, therefore, &s;hould re&s;t till he has &s;atisfactorily di&s;covered the mind of GOD in this matter. If the chri&s;tian &s;abbath be of divine in|&s;titution, it is doubtle&s;s of great importance to reli|gion, that it be well kept; and therefore, that every chri&s;tian be well acquainted with the in&s;titution.</P>
<P>IF men only take it upon tru&s;t, and keep the fir&s;t day of the week only becau&s;e their parents taught
<PB N="226" REF="016767_0222_0F9E191709020F90">
them &s;o, or becau&s;e they &s;ee others do &s;o, and &s;o they take it for certain, that it is right; they will never be likely to keep it &s;o con&s;cientiou&s;ly and &s;trictly, as if they had &s;een with their own eyes, and had been convinced by &s;eeing for them&s;elves, good grounds in the word of GOD, for their practice&punc; and unle&s;s they do &s;ee thus for them&s;elves, whenever they are negli|gent in &s;anctifying the &s;abbath, or are guilty of pro|faning it; their con&s;ciences will not have that ad|vantage to &s;mite them for it, as otherwi&s;e they would.&mdash;And tho&s;e who have a &s;incere de&s;ire to obey GOD in all things, will keep the &s;abbath more carefully and more chearfully, if they have &s;een and been con|vinced, that therein they do what is according to the will and command of GOD, and what is acceptable to him; and will al&s;o have a great deal more comfort in the reflection upon their having carefully and painfully kept the &s;abbath.</P>
<P>THEREFORE, I de&s;ign now, by the help of GOD, to &s;how, that it is &s;ufficiently revealed in the &s;criptures, to be the mind and will of GOD, that the fir&s;t day of the week &s;hould be di&s;tingui&s;hed, in the chri&s;tian church, from other days of the week, as a &s;abbath, to be devoted to religious exerci&s;es.</P>
<P>IN order to this, I &s;hall here premi&s;e, that the mind and will of GOD, concerning any duty to be performed by us, may be &s;ufficiently revealed in his word, without a particular precept in &s;o many ex|pre&s;s terms, enjoining it.&mdash;The human under&s;tand|ing is the ear to which the word of GOD is &s;poken; and if it be &s;o &s;poken, that that ear may plainly hear it, it is enough. GOD is &s;overeign as to the manner of &s;peaking his mind, whether he will &s;peak it in ex|pre&s;s terms, or whether he will &s;peak it by &s;aying &s;everal other things which imply it, and from which
<PB N="227" REF="016767_0223_0F9E1917A54A0158">
we may, by comparing them together, plainly perceive it. If the mind of GOD be but revealed, if there be but &s;ufficient means for the communication of his mind to our minds, that is &s;ufficient; whether we hear &s;o many expre&s;s words with our ears, or &s;ee them in writing with our eyes; or whether we &s;ee the thing that he would &s;ignify to us, by the eye of rea&s;on and under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>WHO can po&s;itively &s;ay, that if it had been the mind of GOD, that we &s;hould keep the fir&s;t day of the week, he would have commanded it in expre&s;s terms, as he did the ob&s;ervation of the &s;eventh day of old?&mdash;Indeed, if GOD had &s;o made our faculties, that we were not capable of receiving a revelation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> his mind in any other way; then there would have been &s;ome rea&s;on to &s;ay &s;o. But GOD hath given us &s;uch under&s;tandings, that we are capable of receiving a revelation, when made in another manner. And if GOD deals with us agreeably to our natures, and in a way &s;uitable to our capacities, it is enough. If GOD di&s;covers his mind in any way what&s;oever, provided it be according to our faculties, we are obliged to o|bedience; and GOD may expect our notice and ob|&s;ervance of his revelation, in the &s;ame manner as if he had revealed it in expre&s;s terms.</P>
<P>I SHALL &s;peak upon this &s;ubject under the&s;e two general propo&s;itions:</P>
<P N="1">1. IT is &s;ufficiently clear, that it is the mind of GOD, that one day of the week &s;hould be devoted to re&s;t, and to religious exerci&s;es, throughout all ages and nations.</P>
<P N="2">2. IT is &s;ufficiently clear, that under the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, this day is the fir&s;t day of the week.</P>
<P N="1">1. PROP. IT is &s;ufficiently clear, that it is the mind of GOD, that one day of the week &s;hould be de|voted
<PB N="228" REF="016767_0224_0F9E19186441E410">
to re&s;t, and to religious exerci&s;es, throughout all ages and nations; and not only among the anti|ent I&s;raelites, till CHRIST came, but even in the&s;e go&s;|pel times, and among all nations profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;ti|anity.</P>
<P>I. FROM the con&s;ideration of the nature and &s;tate of mankind in this world, it is mo&s;t con&s;onant to human rea&s;on, that certain fixed parts of time &s;hould be &s;et apart, to be &s;pent by the church wholly in re|ligious exerci&s;es, and in the duties of divine wor&s;hip. It is a duty incumbent on all mankind, in all ages a like, to wor&s;hip and &s;erve GOD. His &s;ervice &s;hould be our great bu&s;ine&s;s. It becomes us to wor&s;hip him with the greate&s;t devotion and engagedne&s;s of mind; and therefore to put our&s;elves, at proper times, in &s;uch circum&s;tances, as will mo&s;t contribute to ren|der our minds entirely devoted to this work, without being diverted or interrupted by other things.</P>
<P>THE &s;tate of mankind in this world is &s;uch, that we are called to concern our&s;elves in &s;ecular bu&s;ine&s;s and affairs, which will nece&s;&s;arily, in a con&s;iderable degree, take up the thoughts and engage the attenti|on of the mind. However, &s;ome particular per&s;ons may be in &s;uch circum&s;tances, as to be more free and di&s;engaged; yet the &s;tate of mankind is &s;uch, that the bulk of them, in all ages and nations, are called ordi|narily to exerci&s;e their thoughts about &s;ecular affairs, and to follow worldly bu&s;ine&s;s, which in it's own na|ture, is remote from the &s;olemn duties of religion.</P>
<P>IT is therefore mo&s;t meet and &s;uitable, that cer|tain times &s;hould be &s;et apart, upon which men &s;hould be required to throw by all other con|cerns, that their minds may be the more freely and entirely engaged in &s;piritual exerci&s;es, in the duties of religion, and in the immediate wor|&s;hip
<PB N="229" REF="016767_0225_0F9E191959388718">
of GOD; and that their minds being di&s;engaged from common concerns, their religion may not be mixed with them.</P>
<P>IT is al&s;o &s;uitable that the&s;e times &s;hould be fixed and &s;ettled, that the church may agree therein, and that they &s;hould be the &s;ame for all, that men may not interrupt one another; but may rather a&s;&s;i&s;t one another by mutual example. For example has a great influence in &s;uch ca&s;es. If there be a time &s;et apart for public rejoicing, and there be a general ma|nife&s;tation of joy, the general example &s;eems to in|&s;pire men with a &s;pirit of joy and mirth; one kindles another.&mdash;So, if it be a time of mourning, and there be general appearances and manife&s;tations of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it naturally affects the mind, it di&s;po&s;es it to depre&s;|&s;ion, it ca&s;ts a gloom upon it, and does as it were dull and deaden the &s;pirits.&mdash;So, if a certain time be &s;et apart as holy time, for general devotion, and &s;olemn religious exerci&s;es, a general example tends to render the &s;pirit &s;erious and &s;olemn.</P>
<P N="2">2. WITHOUT doubt, one proportion of time is better and fitter than another, for this purpo&s;e. One proportion is more &s;uitable to the &s;tate of mankind, and will have a greater tendency to an&s;wer the ends of &s;uch times, than another. The times may be too far a&s;under: I think human rea&s;on is &s;ufficient to di&s;cover, that it would be too &s;eldom for the purpo&s;es of &s;uch &s;olemn times, that they &s;hould be but once a year. So, I conclude, no body will deny, but that &s;uch times may be too near together to agree with the &s;tate and nece&s;&s;ary affairs of mankind.</P>
<P>THEREFORE, there can be no difficulty in allowing, that &s;ome certain proportion of time, whether we can exactly di&s;cover it or not, is really fitte&s;t and be&s;t; and con&s;idering all things, con&s;idering the end for
<PB N="230" REF="016767_0226_0F9E1919F3E53F70">
which &s;uch times are kept, and the condition, circum|&s;tances and nece&s;&s;ary affairs of men, and con&s;idering what the &s;tate of man is, taking one age and nation with another, that one proportion of time is more convenient and &s;uitable, than any other: which GOD may know and exactly determine, though we, by rea&s;on of the &s;cantine&s;s of our under&s;tandings, cannot.</P>
<P>AS a certain frequency of the returns of the&s;e times may be more &s;uitable, than any other, &s;o one length or continuance of the times them&s;elves may be fitter than another, to an&s;wer the purpo&s;es of &s;uch times. If &s;uch times, when they come, were to la&s;t but an hour, it would not well an&s;wer the end; for then worldly things would crowd too nearly upon &s;acred exerci&s;es, and there would not be that opportunity to get the mind &s;o thoroughly free and di&s;engaged from other things, as there would be, if the times were long|er. But they being &s;o &s;hort, &s;acred and profane things would be as it were mixed together.&mdash;There|fore, a certain di&s;tance between the&s;e times, and a cer|tain continuance of them, when they come, is more proper than others; which GOD knows and is able to determine, though perhaps we cannot.</P>
<P N="3">3. IT is unrea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e any other, than that GOD'S working &s;ix days, and re&s;ting the &s;eventh, and ble&s;&s;ing and hallowing it, was to be of general u&s;e in determining this matter, and that it is written, that the practice of mankind in general might &s;ome way or other be regulated by it. What could be the meaning of GOD'S re&s;ting the &s;eventh day, and hallow|ing and ble&s;&s;ing it, which he did, before the giving of the fourth commandment; unle&s;s he hallowed and ble&s;&s;ed it with re&s;pect to mankind? For, he did not ble&s;s and &s;anctify it with re&s;pect to him&s;elf, or that he him&s;elf and within him&s;elf might ob&s;erve it: as
<PB N="231" REF="016767_0227_0F9E191AA6FAD608">
that is mo&s;t ab&s;urd. And it is unrea&s;onable to &s;up|po&s;e that he hallowed it only with re&s;pect to the Jews, a particular nation, which ro&s;e up above two thou&s;and years after.</P>
<P>SO much therefore mu&s;t be intended by it, that it was his mind, that mankind &s;hould, after his example, work &s;ix days, and then re&s;t, and hallow or &s;anctify the next following; and that they &s;hould &s;anctify e|very &s;eventh day, or that the &s;pace between re&s;t and re&s;t, one hallowed time and another, among his crea|tures here upon earth, &s;hould be &s;ix days.&mdash;So that it hence appears to be the mind and will of GOD, that not only the Jews, but men in all nations and ages, &s;hould &s;anctify one day in &s;even: which is the thing we are endeavouring to prove.</P>
<P N="4">4. THE mind of GOD in this matter is clearly re|vealed in the fourth commandment. The will of GOD is there revealed, not only that the I&s;raeliti&s;h nation, but that all nations, &s;hould keep every &s;eventh day holy; or, which is the &s;ame thing, one day after every &s;ix. This command, as well as the re&s;t, is doubtle&s;s everla&s;ting and of perpetual obligation, at lea&s;t, as to the &s;ub&s;tance of it, as is intimated by its being engraven on the tables of &s;tone. Nor is it to be thought that CHRIST ever aboli&s;hed any command of the ten; but that there is the complete number <HI>ten</HI> yet, and will be to the end of the world.</P>
<P>SOME &s;ay, that the fourth command is perpetual, but not in its literal &s;en&s;e, not as de&s;igning any par|ticular proportion of time to be &s;et apart and devoted to literal re&s;t and religious exerci&s;es. They &s;ay, that it is aboli&s;hed in that &s;en&s;e, and &s;tands in force only in a my&s;tical &s;en&s;e, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> as that weekly re&s;t of the Jews typified &s;piritual re&s;t in the Chri&s;tian church. And &s;o, they &s;ay, that we under the go&s;pel are not
<PB N="232" REF="016767_0228_0F9E191B62AE1128">
to make any di&s;tinction of one day from another, but are to keep all time holy, doing every thing in a &s;pi|ritual manner.</P>
<P>BUT this is an ab&s;urd way of interpreting the command, as it refers to Chri&s;tians. For if the com|mand be &s;o far aboli&s;hed, it is entirely aboli&s;hed. For it is the very de&s;ign of the command, to fix the time of wor&s;hip. The fir&s;t command fixes the ob|ject, the &s;econd the means, the third the manner, the fourth the time. And, if it &s;tands in force how only as &s;ignifying a &s;piritual, Chri&s;tian re&s;t, and holy be|haviour at all times, it doth not remain as one of the ten commands, but as a &s;ummary of all the com|mands.</P>
<P>THE main <HI>objection</HI> again&s;t the perpetuity of this command is, that the duty required is not <HI>moral.</HI> Tho&s;e laws who&s;e obligation ari&s;es from the nature of things, and from the general &s;tate and nature of mankind, as well as from GOD'S po&s;itive revealed will, are called <HI>moral</HI> laws. Others, who&s;e obligation depends merely upon GOD'S po&s;itive and arbitrary in&s;titution, are not moral; &s;uch as the ceremonial laws, and the precepts of the go&s;pel, about the two &s;acraments. Now, the objectors &s;ay, they will allow all that is moral in the decalogue to be of perpetual obligation. But this command, they &s;ay, is not moral.</P>
<P>BUT this objection is weak and in&s;ufficient for the purpo&s;e, for which it is brought, or to prove that the fourth command, as to the &s;ub&s;tance of it, is not of perpetual obligation. For,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) If it &s;hould be allowed that there is no mora|lity belonging to the command, and that the duty required, is founded merely on arbitrary in&s;titution, it cannot therefore be certainly concluded, that the
<PB N="233" REF="016767_0229_0F9E191C52AF2460">
command is not perpetual. We know that there may be commands in force under the go&s;pel, and to the end of the world, which are not moral: &s;uch are the in&s;titutions of the two &s;acraments. And why may there not be po&s;itive commands in force, in all ages of the church? If po&s;itive, arbitrary in&s;titutions are in force in go&s;pel times, what is there which concludes, that no po&s;itive precept, given before the times of the go&s;pel, can yet continue in force? But,</P>
<P N="2">(2.) As we have ob&s;erved already, the thing in ge|neral, that there &s;hould be certain fixed parts of time, &s;et apart to be devoted to religious exerci&s;es, is found|ed in the fitne&s;s of the thing, ari&s;ing from the nature of things, and the nature and univer&s;al &s;tate of man|kind. Therefore, there is as much rea&s;on that there &s;hould be a command of perpetual and univer&s;al o|bligation about this, as about any other duty what|&s;oever. For if the thing in general, that there be a time fixed, be founded in the nature of things, there is con&s;equent upon it a nece&s;&s;ity, that the time be li|mited by a command. For there mu&s;t be a propor|tion of time fixed, or el&s;e the general moral duty can|not be ob&s;erved.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) THE particular determination of the propor|tion of time in the fourth commandment, is al&s;o founded in the nature of things, only our under|&s;tandings are not &s;ufficient ab&s;olutely to determine i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of them&s;elves. We have ob&s;erved already, that with|out doubt one proportion of time is in it&s;elf fitter than another, and a certain continuance of time fitter than any other, con&s;idering the univer&s;al &s;tate and nature of mankind; which GOD may &s;ee, though our under&s;tandings are not perfect enough ab&s;olutely to determine it. So that the difference between this command and others, doth not lie in this, that other
<PB N="234" REF="016767_0230_0F9E191CE8B2A7C8">
commands are founded in the fitne&s;s of, the things them&s;elves, ari&s;ing from the univer&s;al &s;tate and nature of mankind, and this not: but only in this, that the fitne&s;s of other commands is more obvious to the under&s;tandings of men, and they might have &s;een it of them&s;elves; but this could not be preci&s;ely di&s;co|vered and po&s;itively determined without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of revelation.</P>
<P>SO that the command of GOD, that every &s;eventh day &s;hould be devoted to religious exerci&s;es, is found|ed in the univer&s;al &s;tate and nature of mankind, as well as other commands; only man's rea&s;on is not &s;uffi|cient, without divine direction, &s;o exactly to determine it: Though perhaps man's rea&s;on is &s;ufficient to de|termine, that it ought not to be much &s;eldomer, nor much oftener than once in &s;even days.</P>
<P N="5">5. IT further confirms it, that it is the mind and will of GOD, that &s;uch a weekly &s;abbath &s;hould for ever be kept, that GOD appears in his word as laying abundantly more weight on this precept concerning the &s;abbath, than on any precept of the ceremonial law; not only by in&s;erting it in the decalogue, and making it one of the ten commands, which were de|livered by GOD with an audible voice, by writing it with his own finger on the tables of &s;tone, which were the work of GOD in the mount, and by appoint|ing it afterwards to be written on the tables which Mo&s;es made: but as the keeping of the weekly &s;ab|bath is &s;poken of by the prophets, as that wherein con&s;i&s;ts a great part of holine&s;s of life; and as it is in&s;erted among moral duties, as particularly in I&s;a. lviii. 13, 14. <Q>If thou turn away thy foot from the &s;abbath, from doing thy plea&s;ure on my holy day, and call the &s;abbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honorable, and &s;halt honor him, not do|ing
<PB N="235" REF="016767_0231_0F9E19233079AEE8">
thine own ways, nor finding thine own plea|&s;ure, nor &s;peaking thine own words: then &s;halt thou delight thy&s;elf in the LORD, and I will cau&s;e thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father; for the mouth of the LORD hath &s;poken it.</Q></P>
<P N="6">6. IT is foretold, that this command &s;hould be ob&s;erved in go&s;pel times; as in I&s;ai. lvi. at the be|ginning, where the due ob&s;ervation of the &s;abbath is &s;poken of as a great part of holine&s;s of life, and is placed among moral duties. It is al&s;o mentioned as a duty that &s;hould be mo&s;t acceptable to GOD from his people, even where the prophet is &s;peaking of go&s;pel times; as in the foregoing chapter, and in the fir&s;t ver&s;e of this chapter. And, in the 3d and 4th ver&s;es, the prophet is &s;peaking of the abolition of the ceremonial law in go&s;pel times, and particularly of that law, which forbids eunuchs to come into the congregation of the LORD. Yet, here the men is pronounced <HI>ble&s;&s;ed, who keeps the &s;abbath from polluting it,</HI> ver. 2. And even in the very &s;entence where the eunuchs are &s;poken of as being free from the ceremonial law, they are &s;poken of as being yet under obligation to keep the &s;abbath, and their keeping of it, as that which God lays great weight upon: <Q>For, thus &s;aith the LORD, unto the eunuchs that keep my &s;abbaths, and choo&s;e the things that plea&s;e me, and take hold of my covenant; even unto them will I give in mine hou&s;e, and within my walls, a place and a name, better than of &s;ons and of daughters: I will give them an everla&s;ting name, that &s;hall not be cut off.</Q></P>
<P>BESIDES, the &s;trangers &s;poken of in the 6th and 7th ver&s;e, are the Gentiles, that &s;hould be called in the times of the go&s;pel, as is evident by the la&s;t clau&s;e
<PB N="236" REF="016767_0232_0F9E19247431C930">
in the 7th, and by the 8th ver&s;e; <Q>For mine hou&s;e &s;hall be called an hou&s;e of prayer <HI>for all people.</HI> The LORD GOD which gathereth the outca&s;ts of I&s;rael, &s;aith, Yet will I gather <HI>others</HI> to him, <HI>be&s;ides tho&s;e that are gathered unto him.</HI></Q> Yet it is repre|&s;ented here as <HI>their</HI> duty to keep the &s;abbath: <Q>Al|&s;o the <HI>&s;ons of the &s;tranger,</HI> that join them&s;elves to the LORD, to &s;erve him, and to love the name of the LORD, to be his &s;ervants, <HI>every one that keepeth the &s;abbath from polluting it,</HI> and taketh hold of my covenant: even <HI>them will I bring</HI> to my holy mountain, and <HI>make them joyful in my hou&s;e of prayer.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="7">7. A FURTHER argument for the perpetuity of the &s;abbath, we have in Matth. xxiv. 20. <Q>Pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, <HI>neither on the &s;abbath day.</HI></Q> CHRIST is here &s;peaking of the flight of the apo&s;tles and other chri&s;tians out of Jeru&s;alem and Judea, ju&s;t before their final de&s;truction, as is manife&s;t by the whole context, and e&s;pecially by the 16th ver&s;e: <Q>Then let them which be in Judea flee into the mountains.</Q> But this final de&s;truction of Jeru&s;alem was after the di&s;&s;olution of the Jewi&s;h con&s;titution, and after the chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation was fully &s;et up. Yet, it is plainly implied in the&s;e words of our LORD, that even then chri&s;tians were bound to a &s;trict ob&s;ervation of the &s;abbath.</P>
<P>THUS I have &s;hewn, that it is the will of GOD, that every &s;eventh day be devoted to re&s;t and to religious exerci&s;es.</P>

1. THE words of the fourth commandment af|ford no objection again&s;t this being the day that &s;hould be the &s;abbath, any more than again&s;t any o|ther day. That this day, which, according to the Jewi&s;h reckoning, is the fir&s;t of the week, &s;hould be kept as a &s;abbath, is no more oppo&s;ite to any &s;en|tence or word of the fourth command, than that the &s;eventh of the week &s;hould be the day: and that be|cau&s;e the words of the fourth command do not de|termine which day of the week we &s;hould keep as a &s;abbath; they meerly determine this, that we &s;hould re&s;t and keep as a &s;abbath every &s;eventh day, or one day after every &s;ix. It &s;ays, <HI>Six days thou &s;halt labour, and the &s;eventh thou &s;halt re&s;t:</HI> which implies no more, than that after &s;ix days of labour, we &s;hall, upon the next to the &s;ixth, re&s;t and keep it holy. And &s;o, to be &s;ure, we are obliged to do for ever. But the words no way determine where tho&s;e &s;ix days &s;hall begin, and &s;o where the re&s;t or &s;abbath &s;hall fall. There is no direction in the fourth command how to reckon the time, <HI>i. e.</HI> where to begin and end it. That is not meddled with in the fourth command, but is &s;up|po&s;ed to be determined otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>THE Jews did not know, by the fourth command, where to begin their &s;ix days, and on which particu|lar day to re&s;t; this was determined by another pre|cept. The fourth command does indeed &s;uppo&s;e a particular day appointed; but it does not appoint any. It requires us to re&s;t and keep holy a &s;eventh day, one after every &s;ix of labour, which particular day GOD either had or &s;hould appoint. The parti|cular day was determined for that nation in another place, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> in Exod. xvi. 23, 25, 26. <Q>And he &s;aid, unto them, This is that which the LORD hath &s;aid, <HI>To morrow</HI> is the re&s;t of the holy &s;abbath unto the
<PB N="239" REF="016767_0235_0F9E1926A363DC38">
LORD: bake that which ye will bake to day, and &s;eethe that ye will &s;eethe; and that which re|maineth over, lay up for you to be kept until the morning.&mdash;And Mo&s;es &s;aid, Eat that to day; for <HI>to day is a &s;abbath unto the Lord:</HI> to-day ye &s;hall not find it in the field. Six days ye &s;hall gather it; but <HI>the &s;eventh day, which is the &s;abbath,</HI> in it there &s;hall be none.</Q> This is the fir&s;t place where we have any mention made of the &s;abbath, from the fir&s;t &s;abbath on which GOD re&s;ted.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems, that the I&s;raelites, in the time of their bondage in Egypt, had lo&s;t the true reckoning of time, by the days of the week reckoning from the fir&s;t day of the creation; if it had been kept up till that time. They were &s;laves and in cruel bondage, and had in a great mea&s;ure forgotten the true religi|on&punc; for we are told, that they &s;erved the gods of Egypt. And it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the Egyp|tians would &s;uffer their &s;laves to re&s;t from their work every &s;eventh day. Now, they having re|mained in bondage for &s;o long a time, had probably lo&s;t the weekly reckoning; therefore, when GOD had brought them out of Egypt into the wilderne&s;s, he made known to them the &s;abbath, on the occa&s;ion, and in the manner recorded in the text ju&s;t now quoted. Hence, we read in Nehemiah, that when GOD had led the children of I&s;rael out of Egypt, &amp;c. he made known unto them his holy &s;abbath; Neh. ix. 14. <Q>And made&s;t known unto them thy holy &s;abbath.</Q> To the &s;ame effect we read in Ezek. xx. 10, 12. <Q>Wherefore, I cau&s;ed them to go forth out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wilderne&s;s. Moreover al&s;o, I gave them my &s;abbaths.</Q></P>
<P>BUT they never would have known where the par|ticular
<PB N="240" REF="016767_0236_0F9E1928189359F0">
day would have fallen, by the fourth com|mand. Indeed, the fourth command, as it was &s;po|ken to the Jews, did refer to their Jewi&s;h &s;abbath. But that doth not prove, that that day was determin|ed and appointed by it. The precept in the fourth command is to be taken generally of a &s;eventh day, &s;uch a &s;eventh day as GOD &s;hould appoint, or had ap|pointed. And becau&s;e &s;uch a particular day had been already appointed for the Jewi&s;h church; there|fore, as it was &s;poken to them, it did refer to that particular day. But this doth not prove, but that the &s;ame words refer to another appointed &s;eventh day, now in the chri&s;tian church. The words of the fourth command may oblige the church, under dif|ferent di&s;pen&s;ations, to ob&s;erve different appointed &s;e|venth days, as well as the fifth command may oblige different per&s;ons to honor different fathers and mo|thers.</P>
<P>THE chri&s;tian &s;abbath, in the &s;en&s;e of the fourth command, is as much the &s;eventh day, as the Jewi&s;h &s;abbath; becau&s;e, it is kept every &s;eventh day, as much as that; it is kept after &s;ix days of labour, as well as that; it is the &s;eventh, reckoning from the beginning of our fir&s;t working day, as well as that was the &s;eventh from the beginning of their fir&s;t working day. All the difference is, that the &s;even days formerly began from the day after God's re&s;t from the creation, and now they begin the day after that. It is no matter by what names the days are called: if our nation had, for in&s;tance, called Wed|ne&s;day the fir&s;t of the week, it would have been all one as to this argument.</P>
<P>THEREFORE, by the in&s;titution of the chri&s;tian &s;ab|bath, there is no change from the fourth command; but the change is from another law, which determin|ed
<PB N="241" REF="016767_0237_0F9E19282EAFEF50">
the beginning and ending of their working days. So that tho&s;e words of the fourth command <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <Q>Six days &s;halt thou labour and do all thy work; but the &s;eventh day is the &s;abbath of the LORD thy GOD;</Q> afford no objection again&s;t that which is called the chri&s;tian &s;abbath; for the&s;e words remain in full force &s;till. Neither does any ju&s;t objection ari&s;e from the&s;e words following, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <Q>For in &s;ix days the LORD made heaven and earth, the &s;ea, and all that in them is, and re&s;ted the &s;eventh day: wherefore the LORD ble&s;&s;ed the &s;abbath day and and hallowed it.</Q> The&s;e words are not made in|&s;ignificant to chri&s;tians, by the in&s;titution of the chri&s;tian &s;abbath: they &s;till remain in their full force as to that which is principally intended by them. They were de&s;igned to give us a rea&s;on why we are to work but &s;ix days at a time, and then re&s;t on the &s;eventh, becau&s;e GOD hath &s;et us the example. And taken &s;o, they remain &s;till in as much force as ever they were. This is the rea&s;on &s;till, as much as ever it was, why we may work but &s;ix days at a time. What is the rea&s;on that chri&s;tians re&s;t every &s;eventh, and not every eighth, or every ninth, or tenth day? It is becau&s;e GOD worked &s;ix days and re&s;ted the &s;eventh.</P>
<P>IT is true, the&s;e words did carry &s;omething further in their meaning, as they were &s;poken to the Jews, and to the church before the coming of CHRIST: it was then al&s;o intended by them, that the &s;eventh day was to be kept in commemoration of the work of creation. But this is no objection to the &s;uppo&s;ition, that the words, as they relate to us, do not import all that they did, as they related to the Jews. For there are other words which were written upon tho&s;e tables of &s;tone, with the ten commandments, which are

known and allowed not to be of the &s;ame import, as they relate to us, which they were of, as they related to the Jews, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the&s;e words in the preface to the ten commands, <Q>I am the LORD thy GOD which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the hou&s;e of bondage.</Q>&mdash;The&s;e words were written on the tables of &s;tone with the re&s;t, and the&s;e words are &s;poken to us, as well as to the Jews: they are &s;po|ken to all, to whom the commandments them&s;elves are &s;poken, for they are &s;poken as an enforcement of the commandments. But they do not now remain in all the &s;ignification, which they had as they re|&s;pected the Jews. For we never were brought out of Egypt, out of the hou&s;e of bondage, except in a my&s;tical &s;en&s;e.&mdash;The &s;ame may be &s;aid of tho&s;e words which are in&s;erted in the commandments them|&s;elves, Deut. v. 15. <Q>And remember that thou wa&s;t a &s;ervant in the land of Egypt, and that the LORD thy GOD brought thee out thence through a mighty hand, and a &s;tretched out arm: therefore the LORD thy GOD commanded thee to keep the &s;abbath day.</Q></P>
<P>So that all the arguments of tho&s;e, who are again&s;t the chri&s;tian &s;abbath drawn from the fourth com|mand, which are all their &s;trength, come to nothing.</P>
<P N="2">2. THAT he antient church was commanded to keep a &s;eventh day in commemoration of the work of creation, is an argument for the keeping of a weekly &s;abbath in commemoration of the work of redempti|on, and not any rea&s;on again&s;t it.</P>

<P N="2">(2.) THEY are &s;poken of as parallel, particularly in this re&s;pect, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> The relation which they both have to the keeping of a &s;abbath among GOD'S peo|ple, or with re&s;pect to the influence which the&s;e two re&s;ts have, as to <HI>&s;abbatizing</HI> in the church of GOD: for it is expre&s;sly with re&s;pect to this, that they are com|pared together. Here is an evident reference to GOD'S ble&s;&s;ing and hallowing the day of his re&s;t from the the creation to be a &s;abbath, and appointing a &s;ab|bath of re&s;t in imitation of him. For the apo&s;tle is &s;peaking of this, ver 4. <Q>For he &s;pake in a certain place of the &s;eventh day on this wi&s;e, And GOD did re&s;t the &s;eventh day from all his works.</Q> Thus far is evident; whatever the apo&s;tle has re&s;pect to by this keeping of a &s;abbath by the people of GOD, whether it be a weekly &s;abbatizing on earth, or a &s;abbatizing in heaven.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) IT is evident, in the&s;e words, that the prefer|ence is given to the latter re&s;t, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the re&s;t of our SAVIOUR from his works, with re&s;pect to the influ|ence it &s;hould have, or relation it bears, to the &s;ab|batizing of the people of GOD, now under the go&s;pel, evidently implied in the expre&s;&s;ion, <Q>There remain|eth therefore a &s;abbati&s;m to the people of GOD.

re&s;t from the work of creation, doth not remain, but cea&s;es; and that this new re&s;t, in commemoration of CHRIST'S re&s;ting from his works, remains in the room of it.</P>
<P N="4">4. THE Holy Gho&s;t hath implicitly told us, that the &s;abbath which was in&s;tituted in commemoration of the old creation, &s;hould not be kept in go&s;pel times, in I&s;ai. lxv. 17, 18.

<P>LET us under&s;tand this which way we will, it will not be well con&s;i&s;tent with the keeping of one day in &s;even, in the go&s;pel church, principally for the re|membrance and calling to mind of the old creation.

For then hereby the Holy Gho&s;t teaches us, that the chri&s;tian church has much more rea&s;on to commemorate the new creation than the old; in|&s;omuch that the old is worthy to be forgotten in compari&s;on with it.</P>

<P N="5">5. IT is an argument that the Jewi&s;h &s;abbath was not to be perpetual, that the Jews were commanded to keep it in remembrance of their deliverance out of Egypt.

<P>IF there be a &s;abbath kept up in go&s;pel times, as we have &s;hown there mu&s;t be, it is more ju&s;t from the&s;e words to &s;uppo&s;e that it &s;hould be as a memo|rial of that which is &s;poken of in the latter ver&s;e, <HI>the bringing up of the children of I&s;rael from the land of the north;</HI> that is, the redemption of CHRIST, and his bringing home the elect, not only from Jud<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a, but from the north and from all quarters of the world.&mdash;See I&s;ai. xliii. 16&mdash;20.</P>
<P N="7">7. IT is no more than ju&s;t to &s;uppo&s;e, that GOD intended to intimate to us, that the &s;abbath ought by chri&s;tians to be kept in commemoration of CHRIST'S redemption, in that the I&s;raelites were commanded to keep it in remembrance of their deliverance out of Egypt; becau&s;e, that deliverance out of Egypt is an evident, known and allowed type of it. It was contrived and ordered of GOD, on purpo&s;e to repre|&s;ent it; every thing about that deliverance was typi|cal of this redemption, and much is made of it prin|cipally for this rea&s;on, becau&s;e it is &s;o remarkable a type of CHRIST'S redemption. And it was but a &s;hadow, the work in it&s;elf, was nothing in compari|&s;on with the work of redemption. What is a petty redemption of one nation from a temporal bondage, to the eternal &s;alvation of the whole church of the elect in all ages and nations, from eternal damnation, and the introduction of them, not into a temporal Canaan, but into heaven, into eternal glory and ble&s;|&s;edne&s;s? Was that &s;hadow &s;o much to be comme|morated, as that a day once a week, was to be kept on the account of it; and &s;hall not we much more commemorate that great and glorious work, of which it was de&s;igned on purpo&s;e to be a &s;hadow?</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="016767_0245_0F9E1934E744B430">
BESIDES, the words in the fourth commandment, which &s;peak of the deliverance out of Egypt, can be of no &s;ignificancy unto us, unle&s;s they are to be in|terpreted of the go&s;pel redemption: but the words of the decalogue are &s;poken to all nations and ages. Therefore, as the words were &s;poken to the Jews they referred to the type or &s;hadow; as they are &s;poken to us they are to be interpreted of the antitype and &s;ub|&s;tance. For the Egypt from which we under the go&s;pel are redeemed, is the &s;piritual Egypt; the hou&s;e of bondage from which we are redeemed, is a &s;tate of &s;piritual bondage.&mdash;Therefore the words as &s;po|ken to us, are to be thus interpreted, Remember, thou wa&s;t a &s;ervant to &s;in and &s;atan, and the LORD thy GOD delivered thee from this bondage with a mighty hand and out&s;tretched arm; therefore the LORD thy GOD commanded thee to keep the &s;ab|bath day.</P>

But the day of their go|ing through the red &s;ea was the day of their coming up out of Egypt; for till then they were in the land of Egypt.

<P>AND the day on which this was done, we are here taught, that GOD hath made to be the day of the re|joicing of the church.</P>
<P N="9">9. THE abolition of the Jewi&s;h &s;abbath &s;eems to be intimated by this, that CHRIST, the LORD of the &s;abbath, lay buried on that day. CHRIST, the author of the world, was the author of that work of creati|on, of which the Jewi&s;h &s;abbath was the memorial. It was he that worked &s;ix days and re&s;ted the &s;eventh day from all his works, and was refre&s;hed. Yet he was holden in the chains of death on that day.&mdash;GOD who created the world, now in his &s;econd work

of creation, did not follow his own example, if I may &s;o &s;peak; he did not re&s;t on the &s;ame day, but remained impri&s;oned in the grave on that day, and took another day to re&s;t in.</P>
<P>THE &s;abbath was a day of rejoicing; for it was kept in commemoration of GOD'S glorious and graci|ous works of creation and the redemption out of Egypt. Therefore we are directed to call the &s;abbath a delight. But it is not a proper day for the church, CHRIST'S &s;pou&s;e to rejoice, when CHRIST the bride|groom lies buried in the grave, as CHRIST &s;ays, Mat. ix. 15. <Q>That the children of the bride cham|ber cannot mourn, while the bridegroom is with them. But the time will come when the bride|groom &s;hall be taken from them; then &s;hall they mourn.</Q>&mdash;While CHRIST was holden under the chains of death; then the bridegroom was taken from them; then it was a proper time for the &s;pou&s;e to mourn and not rejoice. But when CHRIST ro&s;e again, then it was a day of joy, becau&s;e we are begotten a|gain to a living hope, by the re&s;urrection of JESUS CHRIST from the dead.</P>
<P N="10">10. CHRIST hath evidently, on purpo&s;e and de|&s;ign, peculiarly honored the fir&s;t day of the week, the day on which he ro&s;e from the dead, by taking this day of the week from time to time to appear to the apo&s;tles, and by taking this day to pour out the Holy Gho&s;t on the apo&s;tles, which we read of in the &s;econd chapter of Acts: for this was on the fir&s;t day of the week, being on Penteco&s;t, which was on the fir&s;t day of the week, as you may &s;ee by Levit. xxiii. 15, 16. And by pouring out his &s;pirit on the apo&s;tle John, and giving him his vi&s;ions on this day; Rev. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> 10, "I was in the &s;pirit on the LORD'S day, &amp;c."</P>

<P N="11"><PB N="254" REF="016767_0250_0F9E19397336CB48">
11. IT is evident by the new te&s;tament, that this was e&s;pecially the day of the public wor&s;hip of the primitive church, by the direction of the apo&s;tles. We are told that this was the day that they were wont to come together to break bread: and this they evi|dently did with the approbation of the apo&s;tles, in as much as they preached to them on that day; and therefore doubtle&s;s they a&s;&s;embled together by the direction of the apo&s;tles. Acts xx. 7. <Q>And upon the fir&s;t day of the week, when the di&s;ciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them.</Q>&mdash;So the Holy Gho&s;t was careful that the public contributions &s;hould be on this day, in all the churches, rather than on any other day, as appears by our text.</P>
<P N="12">12. THIS fir&s;t day of the week is in the new te&s;|tament called <HI>the Lord's day;</HI> &s;ee Rev. i. 10.&mdash;Some &s;ay, how do we know that that was the fir&s;t day of the week? Every day is the LORD'S day. But it is ridi|culous &s;o to talk. For the de&s;ign of John is to tell us, when he had tho&s;e vi&s;ions. And if by the LORD'S day is meant any day, how doth that inform us when that event took place?</P>
<P>BUT what is meant by this expre&s;&s;ion we know, ju&s;t in the &s;ame way as we know what is the meaning of any word in the original of the new te&s;tament, or the meaning of any expre&s;&s;ion in an antient language; <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> by what we find to be the univer&s;al &s;ignification of the expre&s;&s;ion in antient times. This expre&s;&s;ion of <HI>the Lord's day</HI> is found by the antient u&s;e of the whole chri&s;tian church, by what appears in all the writings of antient times, even from the apo&s;tles days, to &s;ignify the fir&s;t day of the week.</P>
<P>AND the expre&s;&s;ion implies in it the holine&s;s of the day. For doubtle&s;s the day is called, <HI>the Lord's day,</HI>
<PB N="255" REF="016767_0251_0F9E193AB78F2CD0">
as the &s;acred &s;upper is called <HI>the Lord's &s;upper,</HI> which is &s;o called, becau&s;e it is an holy &s;upper, to be celebra|ted in remembrance of the LORD CHRIST, and of his redemption. So this is an holy day to be kept in remembrance of the LORD CHRIST and his redemp|tion.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t day of the week being in &s;cripture called the LORD'S day, &s;ufficiently makes it out to be the day of the week that is to be kept holy unto GOD; for GOD hath been plea&s;ed to call it by his own name. When GOD puts his name upon any thing, or any thing is called by the name of GOD in &s;cripture, this denotes the bu&s;ine&s;s of that thing and the appropria|tion of it to GOD.&mdash;Thus GOD put his name upon his people I&s;rael, of old; Num. vi. 27. <Q>And they &s;hall put my name upon the children of I&s;rael.</Q> They were called by the name of GOD, as it is &s;aid, 2 Chron. vii. 14. <Q>If my people which are <HI>called by my name,</HI> &amp;c.</Q> <HI>i. e.</HI> They were called GOD'S people, or the LORD'S people. This denoted that they were an holy, peculiar people above all others. Deut. vii. 6. <Q>Thou art an holy people unto the LORD;</Q> and &s;o in ver. 14. and many other places.</P>
<P>So the city Jeru&s;alem was a city that was called by GOD'S name; Jer. xxv. 29.&mdash;<Q>Upon the city which is called by my name.</Q> Dan. ix. 18, 19. <Q>And the city which is called by thy name, &amp;c.</Q> This denoted that that was an holy city, a city cho|&s;en of GOD above all other cities for holy u&s;es, as it is often called <HI>the holy city,</HI> as in Nehem. xi. 1. <Q>To dwell in Jeru&s;alem the holy city;</Q> and in many other places.</P>
<P>So the temple is &s;aid to be an hou&s;e called by GOD'S name; I Kings viii. 43. <Q>This hou&s;e that is call|ed by my name.</Q> And often el&s;e where. That is,
<PB N="266" REF="016767_0252_0F9E193AE1006510">
it was called GOD'S hou&s;e, or the LORD'S hou&s;e. This denoted that it was called an holy place, an hou&s;e devoted to holy u&s;es above all others.</P>
<P>So al&s;o we find that the fir&s;t day of the week is cal|led by GOD'S name, being called in &s;cripture GOD'S day, or <HI>the Lord's day,</HI> which denotes that it is an ho|ly day, a day appropriated to holy u&s;es, above all others in the week.</P>
<P N="13">13. THE tradition of the church from age to age, though it be no rule, yet may be a great confirmati|on of the truth in &s;uch a ca&s;e as this is. We find, by all accounts that it hath been the univer&s;al cu&s;tom of the chri&s;tian church, in all ages, even from the age of the apo&s;tles, to keep the fir&s;t day of the week. We read in the writings which remain of the fir&s;t, &s;econd, and third centuries of the chri&s;tians keeping the LORD'S day; and &s;o in all &s;ucceeding ages: and there are no accounts that contradict them.&mdash;This day hath all along been kept by chri&s;tians, in all countries throughout the world, and by almo&s;t all that have borne the name of chri&s;tians, of all denominations, however different in their opinions as to other things.</P>
<P>NOW, although this be not &s;ufficient of it&s;elf, with|out a foundation in &s;cripture; yet it may be a confir|mation of it, becau&s;e here is really matter of convicti|on in it to our rea&s;on. Rea&s;on may greatly confirm truths revealed in the &s;criptures. The univer&s;ality of the cu&s;tom throughout all chri&s;tian countries, in all ages, by what account we have of them, is a good argument, that the church had it from the apo&s;tles; and it is difficult to conceive how all &s;hould come to agree, to &s;et up &s;uch a cu&s;tom through the world, of different &s;ects and opinions, and we have no account of any &s;uch thing.</P>
<P N="14">14. IT is no way weakening to the&s;e arguments,
<PB N="267" REF="016767_0253_0F9E193E807CA240">
that there is nothing more plainly &s;aid about it in the new te&s;tament, till John wrote his <HI>Revelation,</HI> becau&s;e there is a &s;ufficient rea&s;on to be given for it. In all probability it was purpo&s;ely avoided by the Holy Spirit, in the fir&s;t &s;ettling of chri&s;tian churches in the world, both among the heathen, and among the Jews, but e&s;pecially for the &s;ake of the Jews and out of tenderne&s;s to the Jewi&s;h chri&s;tians. For it is evident that CHRIST and the apo&s;tles declared one thing after another to them gradually as they could bear it.</P>
<P>THE Jews had a regard for their &s;abbath above al|mo&s;t any thing in the law of Mo&s;es, and there was that in the old te&s;tament which tended to uphold them in the ob&s;ervance of this, much more &s;trong|ly, than any thing el&s;e that was Jewi&s;h. GOD had made &s;o much of it, had &s;o &s;olemnly, frequently, and carefully commanded it, and had often &s;o dreadfully puni&s;hed the breach of it, that their was more co|lour for their retaining this cu&s;tom, than almo&s;t any other.</P>
<P>THEREFORE CHRIST dealt very tenderly with them in this point. Other things of this nature we find very gradually revealed. CHRIST had many things to &s;ay, as we are informed, which yet he &s;aid not, be|cau&s;e they could not as yet bear them, and gave this rea&s;on for it, that it was like putting new wine into old bottles. They were &s;o contrary to their old cu&s;toms, that CHRIST was gradual in revealing them. He gave here a little and there a little, as they could bear; and it was a long time before he told them plainly the principal doctrines of the kingdom of heaven.&mdash;He took the mo&s;t favourable opportu|nities to tell them of his &s;ufferings and death, e&s;pe|cially when they were full of admiration at &s;ome &s;ig|nal
<PB N="268" REF="016767_0254_0F9E193ED61A5EF8">
miracle, and were confirmed in it, that he was the Me&s;&s;iah.</P>
<P>HE told them many things much more plainly af|ter his re&s;urrection, than before. But even then, he did not tell them all, but left more to be revealed by the Holy Gho&s;t at Penteco&s;t. They therefore were much more enlightened after that, than before. How|ever, as yet he did not reveal all. The abolition of the ceremonial law about meats and drinks was not fully known, till after this.</P>
<P>THE apo&s;tles were in the &s;ame manner careful and tender of tho&s;e, to whom they preached and wrote. It was very gradually that they ventured to teach them the ce&s;&s;ation of the ceremonial laws of circumci&s;ion and ab&s;tinence from unclean meats. How tender is the apo&s;tle Paul with &s;uch as &s;crupled, in the four|teenth chapter of Romans? He directs tho&s;e who had knowledge to keep it to them&s;elves, for the &s;ake of their weak brethren. Rom. xiv. 22.&mdash;But I need &s;ay no more to evince this.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, I will &s;ay this, that it is very po&s;&s;ible that the apo&s;tles them&s;elves at fir&s;t might not have this change of the day of the &s;abbath fully revealed to them. The Holy Gho&s;t, at his de&s;cent, revealed much to them, yet after that, they were ignorant of much of go&s;pel doctrine; yea, they were &s;o a great while after they acted the part of apo&s;tles, in preach|ing, baptizing, and governing the church. Peter was &s;urprized when he was commanded to eat meats legally unclean; and &s;o were the apo&s;tles in general, when Peter was commanded to go to the Gentiles, to preach to them.</P>
<P>THUS tender was CHRIST of the church, while an infant. He did not feed them with &s;trong meat, but was careful to bring in the ob&s;ervation of the LORD'S
<PB N="209" REF="016767_0255_0F9E194020E2E648">

day by degrees, and therefore took all occa&s;ions to honor it, by appearing from time to time of choice on that day, by &s;ending down his &s;pirit on that day in that remarkable manner at Penteco&s;t; by ordering chri&s;tians to meet in order to break bread on that day, and by ordering their contributions and other duties of wor&s;hip to be holden on it; thus introducing the ob&s;ervation of it by degrees.&mdash;And though as yet the Holy Gho&s;t did not &s;peak very plainly about it, yet GOD took &s;pecial care that there &s;hould be &s;uffi|cient evidences of his will, to be found out by the chri&s;tian church, when it &s;hould be more e&s;tabli&s;hed and &s;ettled, and &s;hould have come to the &s;trength of a man.</P>
<P>THUS I leave it with every one to judge, whether there be not &s;ufficient evidence, that it is the mind and will of GOD, that the fir&s;t day of the week &s;hould be kept by the chri&s;tian church, as a &s;abbath.</P>

<P N="1">1. LET us be thankful for the in&s;titution of the chri&s;tian &s;abbath. It is a thing wherein GOD hath
<PB N="271" REF="016767_0257_0F9E1941DB3CF238">
&s;hown his mercy to us, and his care for our &s;ouls. He &s;hows, that he, by his infinite wi&s;dom, is contriving for our good, as CHRIST teaches us, that the &s;abbath was made for man; Mark ii. 27. <Q>The &s;abbath was made for man, and not man for the &s;abbath.</Q> It was made for the profit and for the comfort of our &s;ouls.</P>
<P>THE &s;abbath is a day of re&s;t: GOD hath appointed that we &s;hould, every &s;eventh day, re&s;t from all our worldly labours. In&s;tead of that, he might have ap|pointed the harde&s;t labours for us to go through, &s;ome &s;evere hard&s;hips for us to endure.&mdash;It is a day of outward, but e&s;pecially of &s;piritual re&s;t. It is a day appointed of GOD, that his people thereon may find re&s;t unto their &s;ouls; that the &s;ouls of believers may re&s;t and be refre&s;hed in their Saviour.&mdash;It is a day of rejoicing; GOD made it to be a joyful day to the church; P&s;al. cxviii. 24. <Q>This is the day which the LORD hath made, we will rejoice and be glad in it.</Q> They that aright receive and improve the &s;abbath, call it <HI>a delight</HI> and <HI>honorable;</HI> it is a plea|&s;ant and a joyful day to them. It is an image of the future heavenly re&s;t of the church. Heb. iv. 9, 10, 11. "There remaineth therefore a re&s;t," (or &s;abbati&s;m as it is in the original) "to the people of GOD. For he that hath entered into his re&s;t, he al&s;o hath cea&s;ed from his own works, as GOD did from his. Let us labour therefore to enter into that re&s;t."</P>
<P>THE chri&s;tian &s;abbath is one of the mo&s;t precious enjoyments of the vi&s;ible church. CHRIST &s;howed his love to his church in in&s;tituting it; and it becomes the chri&s;tian church to be thankful to her LORD for it. The very name of this day, <HI>the Lord's day,</HI> or <HI>Je&s;us's day,</HI> &s;hould endear it to chri&s;tians, as it inti|mates the &s;pecial relation it has to CHRIST, and al&s;o

the de&s;ign of it, which is the commemoration of our dear Saviour, and his love to his church in redeem|ing it.</P>
<P N="2">2. BE exhorted to keep this day holy.&mdash;GOD hath given &s;uch evidences that this is his mind, that he will &s;urely require it of you, if you do not &s;trictly and con&s;cientiou&s;ly ob&s;erve it. And if you do thus ob|&s;erve it, you may have this comfort in the reflection upon your conduct, that you have not been &s;uper&s;ti|ous in it, but have done as GOD hath revealed it to be his mind and will in his word, that you &s;hould do; and that in &s;o doing you are in the way of GOD'S acceptance and reward.</P>
<P>HERE let me lay before you the following <HI>motives</HI> to excite you to this duty.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) BY a &s;trict ob&s;ervation of the &s;abbath, the name of GOD is honored, and that in &s;uch a way as is very acceptable to him. I&s;ai. lviii. 13. <Q>If thou call the &s;abbath a delight, the holy of the LORD, and <HI>&s;halt honor him.</HI></Q> GOD is honored by it, as it is a vi&s;ible manife&s;tation of re&s;pect to GOD'S holy law, and a reverencing of that which has a peculiar relati|on to GOD him&s;elf, and that more in &s;ome re&s;pects than the ob&s;ervation of many other commands. A man may be ju&s;t, and may be generous, and yet not &s;o plainly &s;how re&s;pect to the revealed mind and will of GOD, as many of the heathen have been &s;o. But if a per&s;on, with evident &s;trictne&s;s and care, ob&s;erve the &s;abbath, it is a vi&s;ible manife&s;tation of a con&s;cientious regard to GOD's declaration of his mind, and &s;o is a vi&s;ible honor done to his authority.</P>
<P>BY a &s;trict ob&s;ervation of the &s;abbath, the face of religion is kept up in the world. If it were not for the &s;abbath, there would be but little public and vi|&s;ible appearance of &s;erving, wor&s;hipping and reve|rencing
<PB N="273" REF="016767_0259_0F9E1943287ADAA0">
the &s;upreme and invi&s;ible Being. The &s;abbath &s;eems to have been appointed very much for this end, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> to uphold the vi&s;ibility of religion in pub|lic, or among profe&s;&s;ing &s;ocieties of men; and by how much greater the &s;trictne&s;s is with which the &s;abbath is ob&s;erved, and with how much more &s;olem|nity the duties of it are ob&s;erved among a people; by &s;o much the greater is the manife&s;tation among them, of re&s;pect to the divine Being.</P>
<P>THIS &s;hould be a powerful motive with us to the ob&s;ervation of the &s;abbath. It &s;hould be our &s;tudy above all things to honor and glorify GOD. It &s;hould be the great thing with all that bear the name of chri&s;tians, to honor their great GOD and king, and I hope is a great thing with many that hear me at this time.&mdash;If this be your inquiry, if this be your de|&s;ire, to honor GOD; by this &s;ubject you are directed to one way whereby you may do much in that way, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> by honoring the &s;abbath, and by &s;howing a care|ful and &s;trict ob&s;ervance of it.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) THAT which is the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;abbath is the greate&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s of our lives, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the bu&s;ine&s;s of religion. To &s;erve and wor&s;hip GOD is that for which we were made, and for which we had our being given us. Other bu&s;ine&s;s, which is of a &s;ecular na|ture, and on which we are wont to attend on week days, is but &s;ubordinate, and ought to be &s;ub&s;ervi|ent to the higher purpo&s;es and ends of religion. Therefore &s;urely we &s;hould not think much of devot|ing one &s;eventh part of our time, to be wholely &s;pent in this bu&s;ine&s;s, and to be &s;et apart to exerci&s;e our|&s;elves in the immediate duties of religion.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) LET it be con&s;idered that all our time is GOD'S, and therefore when he challenges of us one day in &s;even, he challenges his own; he doth not ex|ceed
<PB N="274" REF="016767_0260_0F9E1944030D6AF8">
his right; he would not have exceeded it, if he had challenged a far greater proportion of our time to be &s;pent in his immediate &s;ervice. But he hath mercifully con&s;idered our &s;tate, and our nece&s;&s;ities here; and, as he hath con&s;ulted the good of our &s;ouls, in appointing a &s;eventh day for the immediate duties of religion; &s;o he hath con&s;idered our outward nece&s;&s;ities, and hath allowed us &s;ix days for attendance on our outward affairs.&mdash;What unworthy treatment there|fore will it be of GOD, if we refu&s;e to allow him even the &s;eventh day!</P>
<P N="4">(4.) As the &s;abbath is a day which is e&s;pecially &s;et apart for religious exerci&s;es, &s;o it is a day where|in GOD e&s;pecially confers his grace and ble&s;&s;ing.&mdash;As GOD hath commanded us to &s;et it apart to have conver&s;e with GOD, &s;o GOD hath &s;et it apart for him|&s;elf to have conver&s;e with us. As GOD hath com|manded us to ob&s;erve the &s;abbath, &s;o GOD ob&s;erves the &s;abbath too. It is with re&s;pect to the &s;abbath, as Solomon prayed that it might be with re&s;pect to the temple, 2 Chron. vi. 20. His eyes are open upon it; he &s;tands ready then e&s;pecially to hear prayers, to accept of religious &s;ervices, to meet his people, to manife&s;t him&s;elf to them on this day, to give his holy &s;pirit and ble&s;&s;ing to tho&s;e who diligently and con&s;ci|entiou&s;ly &s;anctify it.</P>
<P>THAT we &s;hould &s;anctify the &s;abbath, as we have ob&s;erved, is according to GOD'S in&s;titution. GOD in a &s;en&s;e ob&s;erves his own in&s;titutions; <HI>i. e.</HI> is wont to cau&s;e them to be attended with a ble&s;&s;ing.&mdash;The in|&s;titutions of GOD are his appointed means of grace, and with his in&s;titutions he hath promi&s;ed his ble&s;&s;ing; Exod. xx. 24. <Q>In all places where I record my name, I will come unto thee, and I will ble&s;s thee.</Q> For the &s;ame rea&s;on may we conclude, that GOD will
<PB N="275" REF="016767_0261_0F9E1944B4E707A0">
meet his people and ble&s;s them, waiting upon him not only in appointed places, but at appointed times, and in all appointed ways. CHRIST hath promi&s;ed that where two or three are gathered together in his name, he will be in the mid&s;t of them, Mat. xviii. 20. One thing included in the expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>in his name,</HI> is, that it is by his appointment, and according to his in&s;titution.</P>
<P>GOD hath made it our duty, by his in&s;titution, to &s;et apart this day for a &s;pecial &s;eeking of his grace and ble&s;&s;ing. From which we may argue, that he will be e&s;pecially ready to confer his grace on tho&s;e who thus &s;eek it. If it be the day on which GOD re|quires us e&s;pecially to &s;eek him, we may argue, that it is a day on which e&s;pecially he will be found. That GOD is ready on this day e&s;pecially to be&s;tow his ble&s;&s;ing on them that keep it aright, is implied in that expre&s;&s;ion of <HI>God's ble&s;&s;ing the &s;abbath day.</HI> GOD hath not only hallowed the &s;abbath day, but ble&s;&s;ed it; he hath given his ble&s;&s;ing to it, and will confer his ble&s;&s;ing upon all the due ob&s;ervers of it. He hath hallowed it, or appointed that it be kept holy by us, and hath ble&s;&s;ed it; he hath determined to give his ble&s;&s;ing upon it.</P>
<P>SO that here is great encouragement for us to keep holy the &s;abbath, as we would &s;eek GOD'S grace and our own &s;piritual good. The &s;abbath day is an ac|cepted time, a day of &s;alvation, a time wherein GOD e&s;pecially loves to be &s;ought, and loves to be found. The LORD JESUS CHRIST takes delight in his own day; he delights to honor it; he delights to meet with and manife&s;t him&s;elf to his di&s;ciples on it, as he &s;howed before his a&s;cen&s;ion, by appearing to them from time to time on this day. On this day he de|lights to give his holy &s;pirit, as he intimated by choo&s;|ing
<PB N="276" REF="016767_0262_0F9E19456468D8B8">
it as the day on which to pour out the &s;pirit in &s;o remarkable a manner on the primitive church, and on which to give his &s;pirit to the apo&s;tle John.</P>
<P>OF old GOD ble&s;&s;ed the &s;eventh day, or appointed it to be a day whereon e&s;pecially he would be&s;tow ble&s;&s;ings on his people, as an expre&s;&s;ion of his own joyful remembrance of that day, and of the te&s;t and refre&s;hment which he had on it. Exod. xxxi. 16, 17. <Q>Wherefore the children of I&s;rael &s;hall keep the &s;abbath.&mdash;For in &s;ix days the LORD made hea|ven and earth, and on the &s;eventh he re&s;ted and was refre&s;hed.</Q> As princes give gifts on their birth days, on their marriage days, and the like; &s;o GOD was wont to di&s;pen&s;e &s;piritual gifts on the &s;eventh day.</P>
<P>BUT how much more rea&s;on has CHRIST to ble&s;s the day of his re&s;urrection, and to delight to honor it, and to confer his grace and ble&s;&s;ed gifts on his peo|ple, on this day. It was a day whereon CHRIST re&s;t|ed and was refre&s;hed in a literal &s;en&s;e. It was a day of great refre&s;hment and joy to CHRIST, being the day of his deliverance from the chains of death, the day of his fini&s;hing that great and difficult work of redemption, which had been upon his heart from all eternity; the day of his ju&s;tification by the Father; the day of the beginning of his exaltation, and of the fulfilment of the promi&s;es of the Father; the day when he had eternal life, which he had purcha&s;ed, put into his hands.&mdash;On this day CHRIST doth in|deed delight to di&s;tribute gifts, and ble&s;&s;ings, and joy, and happine&s;s, and will delight to do the &s;ame to the end of the world.</P>
<P>O THEREFORE, how well is it worth our while, to improve this day, to call upon GOD and &s;eek JESUS CHRIST on it!&mdash;Let awakened &s;inners be &s;tirred up by the&s;e things, to improve the &s;abbath day, as they
<PB N="277" REF="016767_0263_0F9E1946240E6860">
would lay them&s;elves mo&s;t in the way of the &s;pirit of GOD. Improve the &s;abbath day to call upon GOD; for then he is near. Improve the &s;abbath day for reading the holy &s;criptures, and diligently attending his wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d preached; for then is the likelie&s;t time to have the &s;pirit accompanying it.&mdash;Let the &s;aints who are de&s;irous of growing in grace, and enjoying com|munion with CHRIST, improve the &s;abbath in order to it.</P>
<P N="5">(5,) THE la&s;t motive which I &s;hall mention, is the experience of the influence, which a &s;trict ob&s;erva|tion of the &s;abbath has upon the whole of religion. It may be ob&s;erved, that in tho&s;e places where the &s;ab|bath is well kept, religion in general will be mo&s;t flouri&s;hing; and that in tho&s;e places where the &s;ab|bath is not much taken notice of, and much is not made of it, there is no great matter of religion any way.</P>
<P>HERE I would give &s;everal DIRECTIONS in an&s;wer to this.</P>
<P>INQUIRY. How ought we to keep the &s;abbath?</P>
<P>ANS. 1, WE ought to be exceedingly careful on this day to ab&s;tain from &s;in. Indeed, all breaches of the &s;abbath are &s;inful; but we &s;peak now of tho&s;e things which are in them&s;elves &s;inful, or &s;inful upon other accounts, be&s;ides that they are done upon the &s;abbath. The &s;abbath being holy time, it is e&s;peci|ally defiled by the commi&s;&s;ion of &s;in. Sin by being committed on this day becomes the more exceeding &s;inful. We are required to ab&s;tain from &s;in at all times, but e&s;pecially on holy time. The commi&s;&s;ion of im|moralities on the &s;abbath is the wor&s;t way of profaning it, that which mo&s;t provokes GOD, and brings mo&s;t guilt upon the &s;ouls of men.</P>
<P>HOW provoking mu&s;t it be to GOD, when men do tho&s;e things on that day which GOD has &s;anctified, and &s;et a part to be &s;pent in the immediate exerci&s;es
<PB N="278" REF="016767_0264_0F9E1946E0F992F8">
of religion, which are not fit to be done on common days, which are impure and wicked whenever they are done!</P>
<P>THEREFORE if any per&s;ons be guilty of any &s;uch wickedne&s;s, as intemperance or any unclean actions, they do in a very horrid manner profane the &s;abbath. Or if they be guilty of wickedne&s;s in &s;peech, of talk|ing profanely, or in an unclean and la&s;civious manner, or of talking again&s;t their neighbours, they do in a dreadful manner profane the &s;abbath.&mdash;Yet very commonly tho&s;e who are u&s;ed to &s;uch things on week days, have not a con&s;cience to re&s;train them on the &s;abbath. It is well if tho&s;e that live in the indulgence of the lu&s;t of uncleanne&s;s on week days, be not &s;ome way or other unclean on the &s;abbath. They will be indulging the &s;ame lu&s;ts then; they will be indulging their impure flames in their imaginations at lea&s;t: and it is well if they keep clear while in the hou&s;e of GOD, and while they pretend to be wor&s;hipping GOD. The unclean young man gives this account of him|&s;elf, Prov. v. 14. <Q>I was almo&s;t in all evil in the mid&s;t of the congregation and the a&s;&s;embly.</Q>&mdash;So tho&s;e who are addicted to an impure way of talk|ing in the week-time, have nothing to keep them from the &s;ame upon the &s;abbath, when they meet together. But dreadfully is GOD provoked by &s;uch things.</P>
<P>WE ought carefully to watch over our own hearts, and to avoid all &s;inful thoughts on the &s;abbath. We ought to maintain &s;uch a reverence for the &s;abbath, as to have a peculiar dread of &s;in, &s;uch as &s;hall awe us to a very careful watch over our&s;elves.</P>
<P N="2">2. WE ought to be careful to ab&s;tain from all worldly concerns. The rea&s;on as we have &s;howed, why it is needful and proper, that certain &s;tated parts of time &s;hould be &s;et apart to be devoted to religious
<PB N="279" REF="016767_0265_0F9E194A2DD035E0">
exerci&s;es, is becau&s;e the &s;tate of mankind is &s;uch in this world, that they are nece&s;&s;itated to exerci&s;e their minds, and employ their thoughts about &s;ecular mat|ters. It is therefore convenient that their &s;hould be &s;tated times, wherein all &s;hould be obliged to throw by all other concerns, that their minds may the more freely and with le&s;s entanglement, be engaged in re|ligious and &s;piritual exerci&s;es.</P>
<P>WE are therefore to do thus, or el&s;e we fru&s;trate the very de&s;ign of the in&s;titution of a &s;abbath. We are &s;trictly to ab&s;tain from being outwardly engaged in any worldly thing, either worldly bu&s;ine&s;s or re|creations. We are to re&s;t in remembrance of GOD'S re&s;t from the work of creation, and of CHRIST'S re&s;t from the work of redemption. We &s;hould be careful that we do not encroach upon the &s;abbath at its be|ginning, by bu&s;ying our&s;elves about the world after the &s;abbath is begun. We &s;hould avoid talking a|bout worldly matters, and even thinking about them; for whether we outwardly concern our&s;elves with the world or not, yet if our minds be upon it, we fru&s;|trate the end of the &s;abbath. The end of its &s;epara|tion from other days is, that our minds may be di&s;|engaged from worldly things; and we are to avoid being outwardly concerned with the world only for this rea&s;on, that that cannot be without taking up our minds.&mdash;We ought therefore to give the world no place in our thoughts on the &s;abbath, but to ab|&s;tract our&s;elves from all worldly concernment, and maintain a watch over our&s;elves, that the world do not encroach, as it is very apt to do. I&s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. lviii. 13, 14.</P>
<P N="3">3. WE ought to &s;pend the time in religious exer|ci&s;es. This is the more ultimate end of the &s;abbath, we are to keep our minds &s;eparate from the world, principally for this end, that we may be the more
<PB N="280" REF="016767_0266_0F9E194D0623E258">
free for religious exerci&s;es.&mdash;Though it be a day of re&s;t, yet it was not de&s;igned to be a day of idlene&s;s: to re&s;t from worldly employments, without employ|ing our&s;elves about any thing, is but to lay our&s;elves &s;o much more in the devil's way. The mind will be employed &s;ome way or other; and therefore, doubtle&s;s, the end for which we are to call off our minds from worldly things on the &s;abbath, in that we may employ them about things that are better.</P>
<P>WE are to attend on &s;piritual exerci&s;es with the greate&s;t diligence. That it is a day of re&s;t, doth not hinder us in &s;o doing; for we are to look on &s;piritual exerci&s;es but as the re&s;t and refre&s;hment of the &s;oul. In heaven, where the people of GOD have the mo&s;t perfect re&s;t, they are not idle, but are imployed in &s;piri|tual and heavenly exerci&s;es.&mdash;We &s;hould take care thereforeto employ our minds on a &s;abbath day, on &s;pi|ritual objects, by holy meditation; improving for our help therein, the holy &s;criptures and other books that are according to the word of GOD.&mdash;We &s;hould al&s;o em|ploy our&s;elves outwardly on this day, in the duties of divine wor&s;hip, in public and private. It is pro|per to be more frequent and abundant in &s;ecret du|ties on this day, than on other days, as we have time and opportunity; as well as to attend on public or|dinances.</P>
<P>IT is proper on this day, not only e&s;pecially to pro|mote the exerci&s;e of religion in our&s;elves; but al&s;o in others; to be a&s;&s;i&s;ting them, and endeavoring to promote their &s;piritual good, by religious conver&s;a|tion and conference.&mdash;E&s;pecially tho&s;e who have the care of others, ought on this day to endeavour to pro|mote their &s;piritual good: heads of families &s;hould be in&s;tructing and coun&s;elling their children, and quickening them in the ways of religion, and &s;hould
<PB N="281" REF="016767_0267_0F9E194E5402DD20">
&s;ee to it that the &s;abbath be &s;trictly kept in their hou&s;es. A peculiar ble&s;&s;ing may be expected upon tho&s;e families, where there is due care taken, that the &s;abbath be &s;trictly and devoutly ob&s;erved.</P>
<P N="4">4. WE are on this day e&s;pecially to meditate upon and celebrate the work of redemption. We are with &s;pecial joy to remember the re&s;urrection of CHRIST; becau&s;e that was the fini&s;hing of the work of redemp|tion, and this is the day whereon Chri&s;t re&s;ted and was refre&s;hed, after he had endured tho&s;e extreme labours, which he endured for our peri&s;hing &s;ouls. This was the day of the gladne&s;s of CHRIST'S heart; it was the day of his deliverance from the chains of death, and al&s;o of our deliverance: for we are delivered in him who is our head. He, as it were, ro&s;e with his elect. He is the fir&s;t fruits; tho&s;e that are CHRIST'S will follow. CHRIST, when he ro&s;e, was ju&s;tified as a public per&s;on, and we are ju&s;tified in him. This is the day of our deliverance out of Egypt.</P>
<P>WE &s;hould therefore meditate on this with joy; we &s;hould have a &s;ympathy with CHRIST in his joy. He was refre&s;hed on this day, we &s;hould be refre&s;hed as tho&s;e who&s;e hearts are united with his. When CHRIST rejoices, it becomes all his church every where to rejoice.&mdash;We are to &s;ay of this day, <Q>This is the day that the LORD hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.</Q></P>
<P>BUT we are not only to commemorate the re&s;urrec|tion of CHRIST, but the whole work of redemption, of which this was the fini&s;hing. We keep the day on which the work was fini&s;hed, becau&s;e it is in re|membrance of the whole work.&mdash;We &s;hould on this day contemplate the wonderful love of GOD and of CHRIST as expre&s;&s;ed in the work of redemption; and our remembrance of the&s;e thing &s;hould be accompa|nied with &s;uitable exerci&s;es of &s;oul with re&s;pect to
<PB N="282" REF="016767_0268_0F9E194E62DD8980">
them. When we call to mind the love of CHRIST, it &s;hould be with a return of love on our part. When we commemorate this work, it &s;hould be with faith in the Saviour.&mdash;And we &s;hould prai&s;e GOD and the Lamb for this work, for the divine glory and love manife&s;ted in it, in our private and public prayers, in talking of the wonderful works of GOD, and in &s;ing|ing divine &s;ongs.</P>
<P>HENCE it is proper that CHRIST'S di&s;ciples &s;hould choo&s;e this day to come together to break bread, or to celebrate the ordinance of the LORD'S &s;upper; (Acts xx. 7.) becau&s;e it is an ordinance in&s;tituted in remembrance of the work of redemption.</P>
<P N="5">5. WORKS of mercy and charity are very proper and acceptable to CHRIST, on this day. They were proper on the antient &s;abbath. CHRIST was wont to do &s;uch works on the &s;abbath-day. But they e&s;peci|ally become the chri&s;tian &s;abbath, becau&s;e it is a day kept in commemoration of the greate&s;t work of mer|cy and love towards us, that ever was wrought. What can be more proper, than that on &s;uch a day we &s;hould be expre&s;&s;ing our love and mercy towards our fellow creatures, and e&s;pecially our fellow chri|&s;tians. CHRIST loves to &s;ee us &s;how our thankfulne&s;s to him in &s;uch ways as the&s;e. Therefore we find, that the Holy Gho&s;t was e&s;pecially careful, that &s;uch works &s;hould be performed on the fir&s;t day of the week, in the primitive church, as we learn by our text.</P>
