<Q><L>And the Lord was with Jeho&s;haphat, becau&s;e be walked in the fir&s;t ways of his father David, and &s;ought not unto Baalim.</L>
<L>But &s;ought to the Lord God of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not after the doings of I&s;rael:</L>
<L>Therefore the Lord &s;tabli&s;hed the kingdom in his hand, and all Judah brought to Jeho&s;haphat pre&s;ents, and he had riches and honour in abundance.</L>

<P>THE great God that formed all things, and that pre&s;erveth them all, is Lord of all. He hath prepared his throne in the heavens, and his king|dom ruleth over all. He doth ac|cording to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth. He is the mo&s;t high, that ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whom|&s;oever he will.

us, That <HI>promotion cometh neither from the ea&s;t, nor from the we&s;t, nor from the &s;outh. But God is the judge: He putteth down one, and &s;etteth up ano|ther,</HI> P&s;al. 75. 6, 7. <HI>A&s;a</HI> king of <HI>Judah</HI> being put down by death, <HI>Jeho&s;haphat</HI> his &s;on is &s;et up, and &s;ucceedeth him in the throne; this we may &s;ee in the clo&s;e of the foregoing chapter, and in the fir&s;t ver&s;e of the chapter before us. As it was with the prie&s;ts of old, concerning whom we are told in Heb. 7. 23. <HI>And they truly were many prie&s;ts, becau&s;e they were not &s;uffered to continue by rea&s;on of death;</HI> So it is re&s;pecting civil rulers of what denominati|on &s;oever: they have their predece&s;&s;ors and their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. <HI>Jeho&s;haphat</HI> had <HI>three</HI> that went before him, and <HI>fifteen</HI> that followed after him in the king|dom of <HI>Judah.</HI> In the hi&s;tory of him, there are &s;e|veral things worthy our notice &amp; ob&s;ervation. The fir&s;t thing we have an account of upon his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne in his father's &s;tead is, His <HI>&s;trengthening him&s;elf again&s;t I&s;rael,</HI> ver. 1. again&s;t the king and people of <HI>I&s;rael:</HI> Thus wi&s;e and prudent was he. He did not live <HI>&s;ecurely</HI> and in a <HI>defencele&s;s</HI> po&s;ture, and &s;o as to become an ea&s;ie <HI>prey</HI> to tho&s;e that &s;hould at any time come out again&s;t him. But he took care to be in a po&s;ture of defence, and to main|tain his own dominions. <HI>He placed forces in all the fenced cities of Judah, and &s;et garri&s;ons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim, which A&s;a his father had taken,</HI> as in ver. 2. Now follows the words of my text, in which we have <HI>Jeho&s;haphat'</HI>s piety acknowleged and declared, or his religious reign &s;poken of to his prai&s;e. Al&s;o the Lord's re|warding the &s;ame &s;everal ways. But more parti|cularly in the&s;e words we may ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Jeho&s;haphat'</HI>s PIETY. He was a man of true piety, of pure and undefiled religion. This cha|racter don't belong to all that &s;it upon Thrones, and

that &s;way the Scepter; neither have we the like ac|count given of all the other Kings of <HI>Judah.</HI> All that rule over men are not men of religion; but He was. We are told ver. 3. <HI>He walked in the fir&s;t ways of his father David. David</HI> was a man after God's own heart, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 13. 14. It is &s;poken of him to his &s;ingular honour after his death, that <HI>his heart was perfect with the Lord his God. And that he did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord, and turned not a&s;ide from any thing that he commanded him all the days of his life, &s;ave only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite,</HI> Kings 15. 3, 5. <HI>David'</HI>s ways (in the ge|neral) we find highly commended in the &s;criptures, and &s;et up as a &s;tandard. See 2 <HI>King.</HI> 14. 3. 16. 2. 18. 3. Not <HI>David</HI> but <HI>A&s;a,</HI> was the father of <HI>Jeho&s;haphat.</HI> So that in&s;tead of <HI>he walked in the fir&s;t ways of his father David,</HI> it &s;eems mo&s;t proper to read thus; <HI>He walked in the ways of David, and his father's fir&s;t ways. A&s;a's</HI> fir&s;t ways were more exemplary, than tho&s;e towards the latter end of his time; as may be &s;een in the hi&s;tory of him in the three foregoing chapters. <HI>Jeho&s;haphat</HI> followed <HI>David</HI> and his father <HI>A&s;a,</HI> wherein they followed God. He did not imi|tate his father in what was ami&s;s in him, towards the clo&s;e of his life. <Q>'Tis good to be cautious (&s;ays one)<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Henry</HI> in loc.</NOTE> in following the be&s;t men, le&s;t we &s;tep a&s;ide after them.</Q> Tho' it be commendable to walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous; to imitate them in their goodne&s;s; yet it is not &s;o to imitate them in their failings and imperfections.</P>
<P>Furthermore, We are told in ver. 3. <HI>And &s;ought not unto Baalim.</HI> And in ver. 4. <HI>But &s;ought to the Lord God of his father, &amp; walked in his commandments,
<PB N="4" REF="003952_0007_10035AE3D0E0FFC8">
and not after the doings of I&s;rael.</HI> He complyed with that command in Matt. 4. 10. <HI>Thou &s;halt wor&s;hip the thy God, and him only &s;halt thou &s;erve.</HI> He was not chargeable with idol wor&s;hip; with wor&s;hipping hea|theni&s;h or fal&s;e Gods. It is &s;aid of him, <HI>That he &s;ought not unto Baalim.</HI> We read frequently of <HI>Baal</HI> and <HI>Baalim</HI> in the &s;cripture. <HI>Baal</HI> &s;ignifies <HI>Lord;</HI> and <HI>Baalim</HI> is plural, and &s;ignifies <HI>Lords.</HI> The fal&s;e Gods of the adjoyning nations, tho' they were diver&s;e, yet <HI>Baal</HI> was a name common to mo&s;t of them. Now the&s;e he abhorred, he paid no religious homage and adoration to them. He did not acknowledge the&s;e, or own any dependance on them. He did not make his addre&s;&s;es to the&s;e, but prayed to and wor&s;hipped <HI>the portion of Jacob,</HI> who <HI>is not like them.</HI> He &s;ought to the Lord God of his father; he wor&s;hipped and &s;erved the living and true God. <HI>He walked in his commandments, and not after the doings of I&s;rael.</HI> We are told in Judges 2. 11. <HI>And the children of I&s;rael did evil in the fight of the Lord, and &s;erved Baalim, and they for&s;ook the Lord God of their fathers, which brought them out of the land of Egypt and followed other gods, of the gods of the people that were round about them, and bowed them&s;elves unto them, and pro|voked the Lord to anger. They wor&s;hipped the golden calves which Jeroboam made and &s;et up,</HI> 1 Kings 12. 28, 29, 30. But now <HI>Jeho&s;haphat</HI> did not di&s;regard the commandments of God as <HI>I&s;rael</HI> did, nor do after their doings: No; he wor&s;hipped the true God ac|cording to his own in&s;titution. He reverenced the divine law, and endeavoured to make others con|form to it: He reformed the wor&s;hip of God; he <HI>took away the high places, and groves out of Judah,</HI> where they wor&s;hip'd their idols; as in the latter part of the 6th. ver.</P>
<P>Once more it is &s;aid in the 6th ver. <HI>That his heart was lift up in the ways of the Lord.</HI> His religion was real; He was &s;incere and hearty in his obedi|ence.
<PB N="5" REF="003952_0008_10035D0552AB1D20">
His heart was inlarged in the &s;ervice of God. P&s;al. 119. 32. He was encouraged by the favour of God, the re&s;pect and affection of his people, in the &s;ervice of God. He was vigorous &amp; active therein; fervent in &s;pirit &s;erving the Lord. His heart was lifted up above di&s;couragements and difficulties in the way of his duty. He was courageous and re&s;o|lute in the ways of the Lord. Thus did king <HI>Jeho&s;haphat'</HI>s piety &s;hine. In the words before us we may ob&s;erve.</P>
<P N="2">2. God's <HI>rewarding him for his piety.</HI> God will not only gloriou&s;ly reward his faithful &s;ervants in the world to come, (<HI>Rev.</HI> 2. 10) but he is plea&s;ed to encourage them in his &s;ervice, and graciou&s;ly re|ward them here. The <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> faith concerning the commandments or righteous judgments of God, in P&s;al. 19. 11. <HI>In keeping of them there is great reward.</HI></P>
<P>It is &s;aid concerning <HI>Jeho&s;haphat</HI> in the text, <HI>That the Lord was with him becau&s;e be walked</HI> &amp;c. ver. 3. and then in ver. 5. <HI>Therefore the Lord &s;tabli&s;hed the kingdom in his hand, and all Judah brought to Jeho|&s;haphat pre&s;ents, and he had riches and honour in abun|dance. Jeho&s;haphat</HI> was happy in the favour of God, and his gracious pre&s;ence with him: God did not rend the kingdom from him, but &s;tabli&s;hed it in his hand. He intere&s;ted him in the affecti|ons of his people: they gave him pre&s;ents in token of their re&s;pect and &s;ubjection to him. <HI>He had riches and honour in abundance.</HI> Now tho' the&s;e things prove a &s;nare to &s;ome, yet they did not to him. They were not improved by him, as fewel to the fire of his lu&s;ts, but as oyl to the wheels of his obedience, as we are a&s;&s;ured in the la&s;t words of the text: <HI>And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the Lord.</HI></P>

The &s;ubject is evidently copious, and the words would admit of much more to be &s;poken from them, than the time will now allow of. I &s;hall therefore mention only &s;ome things which are to be gathered from the&s;e words.</P>
<P>And the fir&s;t Ob&s;ervation or Doctrine from them &s;hall be this, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<P>DOCT. I. <HI>That it is to be &s;poken to the honour of &s;ome civil rulers, that they are truly religious;</HI> that they wor&s;hip and &s;erve the true and living God only, and walk in the ways of their pious predece&s;&s;ors, and imitate them in tho&s;e things wherein they have been exemplary.</P>
<P>Here are three Heads, or Propo&s;itions, which I &s;hall &s;ay &s;omething to di&s;tinctly.</P>
<P>PROP. I. <HI>There are &s;ome among men, that, ac|cording to divine in&s;titution and appointment, are civil rulers.</HI></P>
<P>PROP. II. <HI>Some of the&s;e, are truly religious;</HI> they wor&s;hip and &s;erve the true and living God only, and walk in the ways of their pious pre|dece&s;&s;ors, and imitate them in tho&s;e things wherein they have been exemplary.</P>
<P>PROP. III and la&s;tly. <HI>This is to the prai&s;e and honour of the&s;e civil rulers of whom it is to be &s;poken.</HI></P>
<P>Something briefly to each of the&s;e in their order.</P>
<P>PROP. I. <HI>There are &s;ome among men, that accord|ing to divine in&s;titution and appointment are civil rulers.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="003952_0010_10035AEFD4B817A8">
<HI>Jeho&s;haphat</HI> was &s;uch a civil ruler: He was king of <HI>Judah. David</HI> al&s;o, &s;poken of in the text. And <HI>A&s;a</HI> the father of <HI>Jeho&s;haphat</HI> whom the text hath &s;ome reference to. The&s;e, and many others we have an account of in the &s;acred &s;criptures, were civil rulers among their people.</P>
<P>God the &s;upream ruler, hath for wi&s;e and good ends appointed civil government among men. Ru|lers and ruled are di&s;tinctions of his making: This we may &s;ee in <HI>Rom.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">3. begin. Civil government is burden&s;ome: this is too great a burden to lie upon the &s;houlders of one man. It is needful therefore that more than one, be concerned and employed in it. Agreeable to this are the words of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> unto <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> in Deut. 1. 9. <HI>I am not able to bear you my &s;elf alone.</HI> And in the 12 and 13 ver&s;es, <HI>How can I my &s;elf alone bear your cumbrance and your burden &amp;c.: Take ye wi&s;e men &amp;c, and I will make them rulers over you.</HI> There are rulers of diver&s;e denominations. We read of the <HI>King as &s;upream,</HI> and of <HI>Governors as &s;ent by him,</HI> 1 Pet. 2 13, 14. Of <HI>Coun&s;ellors,</HI> of <HI>Judges,</HI> and the like. According to the differing forms of government among men, &s;o there are per|&s;ons of differing denominations in the &s;tate, each of which have differing bu&s;ine&s;s a&s;&s;igned them, which it concerns them faithfully to attend. This is &s;o plain, that I &s;hall &s;ay no more here, for the con|firmation of this Propo&s;ition, but &s;hall proceed to con&s;ider the &s;econd.</P>
<P>PROP. II. <HI>Some of the&s;e are truly religious;</HI> they wor&s;hip and &s;erve the true and living God only, and walk in the ways of their pious pre|dece&s;&s;ors, and imitate them in tho&s;e things wherein they have been exemplary.</P>

Tho' all the kings of <HI>Judah</HI> were not truly reli|gious, yet <HI>Jeho&s;haphat</HI> was &s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">; as appears from the text and &s;ome other accounts given us of him in the chapter in which my text is, and in the 18, 19, &amp; 20 chapters of this book. <HI>He walked in the ways of David, and in the fir&s;t ways of his father A&s;a: He &s;ought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">t to Baalim, but &s;ought to the Lord God of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not after the doings of I&s;rael; his heart was li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t up in the ways of the Lord.</HI> He was a good king; he abhorred idols, and did not wor&s;hip fal&s;e gods as others, both ruler and ruled did. No; he wor&s;hipped the true God, and attended his in&s;titu|tions: He walked in his commandments: He yielded obedience, &s;incere, univer&s;al, and per&s;evering obe|dience to God mo&s;t high. Indeed he had his fail|ings and infirmities, as all good men have, yet his heart was engaged and enlarged in the &s;ervice of God, and he reverenced the divine law in its lati|tude; he ruled in the fear of God, and endeavour|ed a compliance with his duty in his exalted &s;ta|tion. He imitated his pious predece&s;&s;ors wherein they were exemplary to him. And as he was religi|ous him&s;elf, &s;o he took mea&s;ures to make his peo|ple &s;o. He took care to root out idolatry from among them. <HI>He took away the high places and groves out of Judah,</HI> ver. 6. He &s;ent his princes and with them levites and prie&s;ts to teach in the cities of <HI>Judah;</HI> to teach the people in the truth and their duty. And the&s;e taught the people, as you may &s;ee in the 7, 8, &amp; 9 ver&s;es of the chapter before us. Again we are told, that he brought the people back unto the Lord God of their fathers, that he &s;et Judges in the land, and gave them a &s;olemn charge to judge between man and man righteou&s;ly, and in the fear of the Lord; to admini&s;ter ju&s;tice im|partially and faithfully, as we may &s;ee in chap. 19. Thus religious was he in his reign over <HI>Judah.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="003952_0012_10035D09A7D9B4B8">
And as it was thus with him, &s;o it is with &s;ome others that rule over men&punc; they are found as they &s;hould be, <HI>ju&s;t,</HI> and <HI>ruling in the fear of God,</HI> 2 Sam. 23. 3. <HI>David</HI> was a good ruler: His ways are &s;poken of in the general as a pattern; as hath been already hinted. He was a wor&s;hipper of the true God; he was a man of prayer; he &s;ought God's favour with his whole heart; he walked in his command|ments; he did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord, and turned not a&s;ide from any thing that he commanded him, all the days of his life, &s;ave only in the matter of <HI>Uriah the Hittite:</HI> fore-cited 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 15. 5. But tho' <HI>&s;ome</HI> civil rulers are good, yet others are wicked, <HI>Prov.</HI> 28. 15. Some are <HI>rulers of Sodom,</HI> I&s;a. 1. 10. Some are charged with idolatry; they don't acknowlege the true God, neither are they obedient to him. It is <HI>&s;ome only</HI> in civil au|thority that may be &s;aid con&s;cientiou&s;ly to conform to the precepts of God, and to the examples that they have had for their imitation; and tho&s;e that have done thus are worthy of applau&s;e and com|mendation; which makes my way to the la&s;t Propo&s;ition.</P>
<P>PROP. III. <HI>This is to the prai&s;e and honour of tho&s;e civil rulers of whom it is to be &s;poken.</HI></P>
<P>Religion cordially embraced, and di&s;covered in the life, reflects honour upon tho&s;e who enter upon a religious cour&s;e, and continue evidently therein. To this purpo&s;e we may read in Prov. 4. 89. <HI>Exalt her and &s;he &s;hall promote thee, &s;he &s;hall bring thee to honour, when thou do&s;t embrace her; &s;he &s;hall give to thine head an ornament of grace, a crown of glory &s;hall &s;he deliver thee.</HI> Such as honour God, he will honour, whil&s;t they that de&s;pi&s;e him &s;hall be lightly e&s;teemed. Virtue and piety are dignifying where|ever they are con&s;picuous. Men are wont to prai&s;e
<PB N="10" REF="003952_0013_1003788FC7A99FC8">
others when they do well. We are a&s;&s;ured in Prov. 14. 34. <HI>That righteou&s;ne&s;s exalteth a nation, but &s;in is a reproach to any people.</HI> Such as have the fear of God in their hearts, governing and influencing their lives, are e&s;teemed and honoured by them that know their worth. <HI>The righteous is more excellent than his neighbour:</HI> and the religious man e&s;teems him &s;o, and doth him honour. The good man is &s;poken of in P&s;al. 15. 4. as one, <HI>In who&s;e eyes a vile per&s;on is contemned, but be honours them that fear the Lord.</HI> Yea religion and virtue awe the ungod|ly, and oblige them to pay re&s;pect thereto, and to reverence &s;uch as appear ju&s;t &amp; holy. Mar. 6. 20. <HI>For Herod feared John, knowing him to be a ju&s;t man and an holy.</HI></P>
<P>This adds to the greatne&s;s of tho&s;e that are in civil authority, and that &s;et in the highe&s;t &s;eat of it. This increa&s;eth the glory of the throne, and the honour of him that &s;its upon it. This that is &s;poken of <HI>Jeho&s;haphat</HI> king of <HI>Judah</HI> in the text, is &s;poken to his prai&s;e: The account here is dig|nifying and honourable. And &s;ure it is, when this comes into the character of any in civil rule among men, it is enobling, and &s;erves to increa&s;e the worth of &s;uch, and to render them the more ho|nourable in the &s;ight of the people. But I &s;hall proceed no further in the confirmation of the Doctrine, but &s;hall now make &s;ome improvement of it, before I proceed to a &s;econd Ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>USE I. What we have heard tells us, <HI>That when the rever&s;e of this is to be truly &s;aid of any in civil authority, it is very reproachful and di&s;ho|nourable.</HI></P>
<P>If religion when found in the powers that be, adds much to their greatne&s;s and honour, it

follows that where this is evidently wanting in tho&s;e in civil authority, it is reproachful, and tends very much to the di&s;honour of &s;uch. Irreligion, a contempt of God and his laws, appearing in &s;uch, invites contempt from all thoughtful ob&s;ervers. How reproachful are tho&s;e words in I&s;ai. 1. 10.&mdash;<HI>Ye rulers of Sodom</HI>&mdash;What a &s;hame is it when great men think the &s;ervice of the true and great God below them, and &s;o refu&s;e to engage in it? And when they bow down to idols, and <HI>humble them&s;elves?</HI> as &s;ome &s;uch are &s;aid to do, <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 2. 9. How re|proachful is it to any, and e&s;pecially to rulers, who are obliged in their exalted &s;tation to be ex|emplary to tho&s;e of an inferiour rank, to have it &s;aid of them, <HI>Having a form of godline&s;s, but denying the power of it?</HI> How di&s;honourable is it to that civil Ruler to whom it may be truly &s;aid, as the prophet <HI>Eli&s;ha</HI> did to <HI>Ahab, Thou ha&s;t &s;old thy &s;elf to work evil in the &s;ight of the Lord?</HI> 1 Kings 21. 20.</P>
<P>USE. II. See we hence, <HI>One motive to tho&s;e in civil authority, to be truly religious;</HI> and wor&s;hip and &s;erve the only true and living God, and walk in the ways of their pious predece&s;&s;ors, and imitate them in tho&s;e things wherein they were exemplary.</P>
<P>This will render them <HI>honourable,</HI> and occa&s;ion their being &s;poken in the prai&s;e of. I don't &s;ay that this is the <HI>only motive,</HI> or the <HI>main inducement</HI> to this; neither &s;hould rulers or others do what they do in religion, like the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> to be &s;een of men, and look no higher. But yet both rulers and others &s;hould improve the con&s;ideration of it, to excite them to be truly religious, ina&s;much as this is one argument which the holy Gho&s;t in the &s;criptures makes mention of, to &s;tir men up to a compliance with their duty. It is needful that <HI>&s;uch</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="003952_0015_100378A4DE05D250">
be truly religious, in order to their own &s;afety and happine&s;s: It is needful in order to their be|ing publick ble&s;&s;ings, in order to their doing of the duties of their &s;everal &s;tations, and in order to their being &s;erviceable by their example. The ex|amples that are &s;et by tho&s;e in civil authority, are wont to be influential on tho&s;e over whom they are. See for this <HI>Jer.</HI> 44. 17. Evil examples &s;et by tho&s;e in civil authority, are like to be follow|ed by many. On the other hand, when rulers are remarkably religious, this hath a noble tenden|cy to make their people &s;o, to re&s;train them from vice, and form them to virtue. The&s;e and other con&s;iderations there are to move tho&s;e in civil authority to be religious. And this which is men|tioned in the doctrine, is not unworthy the con&s;i|deration of &s;uch. Honour is indeed due to &s;uch, and it &s;hould be given unto them. <HI>Fear God, honour the king,</HI> 1 Pet. 2. 17. Now the more religious they are, the more honourable they are, and the more likely to have re&s;pect paid them, and honour done them by others.</P>
<P>And now, having been (beyond my expectation) de&s;ired to &s;tand in this desk at this time, and to &s;peak to this numerous audience on this occa&s;i|on; it will not (I conclude) be look'd upon as im|proper for me to apply my &s;elf to &s;everal orders of men among us, &s;ome of which are here pre&s;ent before the Lord.</P>
<P>And the &s;ubject I have been upon, leads me to addre&s;s my &s;elf in the fir&s;t place to our <HI>civil rulers</HI> of one denomination and another. And will <HI>all</HI> the&s;e be per&s;waded, vigorou&s;ly to endeavour to be of the number of tho&s;e civil rulers, of whom it may be truly &s;poken to their honour as in the doctrine? to abhor idolatry and fal&s;e wor&s;hip,
<PB N="13" REF="003952_0016_100377A4579DB338">
and to honour the true God, is the way to be honoured by him; to de&s;pi&s;e him is the way to be lightly e&s;teemed: Thus we are told in 1 Sam. 2. 30. <HI>For them that honour me I will honour, and they that de&s;pi&s;e me &s;hall be lightly e&s;teemed.</HI> To be truly reli|gious, to walk in all the commandments and ordi|nances of the Lord blamele&s;s, and to imitate pious predece&s;&s;ors wherein they were exemplary; among many other advantages of it, this is one, namely, It is the way to be honourably and re&s;pectfully mentioned and &s;poken of. Now &s;ince this cha|racter is &s;o honourable, let all our civil rulers be ambitious to have it ju&s;tly given of them.</P>
<P>And ina&s;much as the honourable per&s;on menti|oned in my text, was chief in the government of <HI>Judah,</HI> and &s;ince by the favour of God and the King, <HI>Your Excellency</HI> is <HI>chief</HI> in the government of this Province, it will not be offen&s;ive, but rather ac|ceptable, I pre&s;ume, to have this royal <HI>pattern</HI> recommended to you, for your imitation.</P>
<P>The laws of God, the rules of religion are all holy ju&s;t and good; they are admirably &s;uited to advance the glory of God the great law-giver, and the intere&s;t of men, both high and low, rich and poor, bond and free, both &s;ingly and collectively con&s;idered: conformity to them are therefore highly rea&s;onable.</P>
<P>There is nothing that doth more dignify even the chief ruler of a people, than unaffected piety, and undi&s;gui&s;ed religion; than a due acknowlege|ment of the true God, and a giving to him the glory that is due unto his name; than for &s;uch to di&s;cover a ju&s;t abhorrence of prophane&s;s and un|&s;criptural wor&s;hip, a due re&s;pect to all God's commandments, and a con&s;cientious and pre&s;erving
<PB N="14" REF="003952_0017_100378BDA83388D0">
obedience to them. What more commendable than for &s;uch to walk in the ways of <HI>David,</HI> and to imitate pious predece&s;&s;ors in tho&s;e things wherein they have been exemplary? And we tru&s;t that it will be your Excellency's ambition to brighten your character in this way, yet more and more.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o, &s;ome other things be&s;ides tho&s;e &s;poken of in the words of my text, in the reign of this pious king, that have been already hinted, that are worthy your con&s;ideration and imitation. As now: His concern and care to have his people well <HI>taught</HI> and <HI>in&s;tructed;</HI> as in the 7, 8, and 9 ver&s;es of the chapter: and to have them al&s;o <HI>pro|tected</HI> and <HI>defended;</HI> as may be &s;een in the latter end of the chapter.</P>
<P>Again, he was exemplary in his concern for the <HI>reformation</HI> of his people, and his bringing them back unto the Lord God of their fathers, from whom they had gone a&s;tray.</P>
<P>Again, he took care that controver&s;ies that aro&s;e among them might be rightly decided, and that ju&s;tice might be done among them, and that with ea&s;e to his &s;ubjects. He <HI>&s;et judges in the land throughout all the cities of Judah, city by city;</HI> and the&s;e he &s;olemnly charged &amp;c. The&s;e things are to be &s;een in the 19th chapter. And may your care, Excellent Sir, appear on all occa&s;ions, and your au|thority and influence be di&s;covered from time to time about the&s;e things, and all others belonging to your exalted &s;tation, the tendency of which, may be to the honour of God and the king, the promoting of religion, the reformation, peace and pro&s;perity of this people, your own peace and com|fort both living &amp; dying, and a ble&s;&s;ed memory after death.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="003952_0018_100377B65F099A38">
And now in the next place I might &s;ay, that the Doctrine before us, is improvable by tho&s;e concerned in the <HI>Election of this day,</HI> for their di|rection in the choice of <HI>Councillors.</HI> If it be &s;o much to the honour of civil rulers to be truly re|ligious, it is plain that no little re&s;pect is to be had to mens religious character in the choice of them into places of government. If men are not truly religious, little great or good is to be ex|pected from them; if men don't fear God, they are not like duly to regard men. Indeed a good inclination and di&s;po&s;ition is not the only needful qualification of a Councellor, but in order to a man's being <HI>an honourable Councellor,</HI> as was <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> of <HI>Arima|thea,</HI> he mu&s;t be a man of knowlege &amp; under&s;tanding, of wi&s;dom, prudence, courage and re&s;olution, of truth, &s;teadine&s;s, loyalty and the like. Due care &s;hould be taken, not to introduce unqualified or irreligi|ous per&s;ons into &s;o great a tru&s;t, but &s;uch whom you have rea&s;on to hope will act up to their dig|nity, and &s;teadily pro&s;ecute all proper mea&s;ures conducive to the honour of God and the King, to bring us back to the God of our fathers, to further religion and virtue among us, the welfare and pro&s;perity of this people. This is rea&s;onably expected from you; and your <HI>unanimity</HI> herein will be <HI>honourable,</HI> and di&s;cover you to be fathers to your Country, and under a becoming concern for the publick good.</P>
<P>I may now proceed to apply my &s;elf to my <HI>re|verend fathers and brethren in the mini&s;try,</HI> to &s;tir up their pure minds by way of remembrance: You know, that it concerns <HI>us,</HI> above all men, to be truly religious, that when we have preached unto others, we our &s;elves may not be ca&s;t-aways; our intere&s;t, our honour, oblige us to be &s;o.

one evidently &s;o? Such a one is odious to God, and the world. Such wound religion greatly, they encourage and embolden &s;inners in their evil ways; they &s;hame and grieve the &s;aints, highly offend God, and bring <HI>men to abhor the offering of the Lord.</HI> The&s;e were the &s;ad fruits of the &s;in of the &s;ons of <HI>Eli,</HI> 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 2. 17. The guilt of &s;uch, and the danger they are in, are very great: Such build up and &s;trengthen the kingdom of darkne&s;s in&s;tead of battering of it down, as they are by their office obliged to do. Our bu&s;ine&s;s is e&s;pecially with the &s;ouls of men, and with theirs peculiarly that are committed to our care, and we &s;hould willingly &s;pend and be &s;pent for them. Our work is to pro|mote the &s;piritual and eternal intere&s;t of men; therefore to u&s;e our earne&s;t and unwearied endea|vours to make them truly religious. Are we not the <HI>lights</HI> of the world, and the &s;alt of the earth? Should we not in&s;truct men in the truth as it is in Je&s;us? We are to preach the <HI>word;</HI> what we de|liver to our people &s;hould be that which we have fir&s;t received of the Lord; yea we mu&s;t not &s;hun declaring the whole coun&s;el of God. We &s;hould be afraid of being found <HI>blind guides;</HI> therefore &s;hould give our &s;elves to reading, meditation and prayer, that our minds may be &s;tored with right appre|hen&s;ions of things, that &s;o the&s;e may be commu|nicated to our hearers for their advantage. <HI>Fal&s;e</HI> and <HI>dangerous doctrines</HI> are what are carefully to be avoided by us. Moreover it concerns us to know how to behave our &s;elves in the hou&s;e of God, to improve our talents, our &s;ea&s;ons and opportu|nities to further the good of the precious &s;ouls that are committed to our care. We &s;hould <HI>magnify our office,</HI> and give none occa&s;ion to de&s;pi&s;e us; we &s;hould give no offence in any thing, that the mi|ni&s;try be not blamed. It concerns us to be exam|ples to the believer, in word, in conver&s;ation, in

charity, in faith, in purity. In the whole of our work we mu&s;t have an eye to the glory of God, the good of &s;ouls; and lay out our &s;elves for the conver&s;ion of &s;inners, and the edification of &s;aints.</P>
<P>And &s;hould we not remember, that we are <HI>&s;et for the defence of the Go&s;pel,</HI> and that we are oblig'd to be <HI>valiant for the truth?</HI> And is there not occa&s;ion to bear in mind that charge, and &s;hould we not care|fully comply with it, <HI>Lay hands &s;uddenly on no man?</HI> We &s;hould not ra&s;hly introduce into the mini&s;try, the <HI>ignorant,</HI> the <HI>erroneous,</HI> the <HI>immoral,</HI> &amp; the <HI>imprudent.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, Should we not be <HI>men of prayer?</HI> much, earne&s;t, and per&s;evering therein: Not only for our &s;elves, but others al&s;o; and particularly for our <HI>ci|vivil Rulers,</HI> however denominated or di&s;tingui&s;hed. <HI>For Kings and for all that are in authority, that we may lead quiet and peaceable lives in all godline&s;s and hone&s;ty.</HI> Are we not obliged to put our people in mind, to <HI>be &s;ubject to principalities and powers, to obey magi&s;trates,</HI> yea <HI>to be ready to every good work?</HI> Our obligation to this we may &s;ee in <HI>Tit.</HI> 3. 1. Should we not excite them to render to Cae&s;ar the things that are Cae&s;ar's, and to God the things that are God's?</P>
<P>In fine, it concerns us to take heed to the mini&s;try that we have received in the Lord that we fulfill it, The time of &s;ome of us, is almo&s;t at an end, of all of us, is &s;hortning continually, and after death is the judgment. It concerns us therefore to be diligent, indu&s;trious and faithful in our Lord's bu&s;ine&s;s, in ex|pectation of his coming, and as ever we would have it &s;aid unto us by him, <HI>Well done good and faithful &s;ervants, enter ye into the joy of your Lord.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall now apply my &s;elf briefly and more gene|rally, <HI>to the People of this Land;</HI> and &s;o fini&s;h this Doctrine.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="003952_0021_100378F04601DF50">
And what I have to offer &s;hall be in a way of Coun&s;el or Exhortation. <HI>O endeavour to become a reformed and truly religious People.</HI> To be truly re|ligious is not only the duty of civil Rulers, and the honour of tho&s;e of them that are &s;o; but it is incum|bent on tho&s;e that are under them, and will be an honour to &s;uch as comply with it. The exhortation is not needle&s;s. It is undeniable that we need to be reformed. There is evidently much that is irregu|lar among us, and the di&s;pen&s;ations of God in his Providence towards us be&s;peak this. Let us then amend our ways and doings that have not been right; and endeavour to become a truly religious People. Our fathers came into this Land on a reli|gious account. See we then to it, that we are not regardle&s;s of that (even pure and undefiled religion) which they were &s;o concerned about, and were at &s;uch charge, and underwent &s;o many difficulties and hard&s;hips, that they might enjoy. Verily our being a truly religious People will be plea&s;ing to God, and for his honour and glory: It will be al&s;o honoura|ble to us. But if we are &s;till a &s;inful People&punc; this will be reproachful to us. According to that in Prov. 14. 34. forementioned. <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s exalteth a na|tion, but &s;in is a reproach to any people.</HI> Religion is <HI>our life, Deut</HI> 32. 47. and the revival of it will be <HI>our glory.</HI> This will engage the gracious pre&s;ence of God with us, and will be rewarded with the &s;miles of God upon us. He will <HI>be with us if we are with him,</HI> 2 Chron. 15. 2. This will render us formida|ble to tho&s;e round about us. We read in the 10<HI>th.</HI> ver. of our context, <HI>And the fear of the Lord fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were round about Judah, &s;o that they made no war with Jeho&s;haphat.</HI> But if we will not be reformed by what God hath done to reclaim us, and will yet walk contrary to him, may we not expect that he will yet <HI>walk con|trary to us, and puni&s;h us yet &s;even times for our &s;ins?</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="003952_0022_100377D166593320">
According to that in <HI>Lev.</HI> 26. 23, 24. Yea if men carry irreligiou&s;ly, will they not expo&s;e them&s;elves to puni&s;hments from men? Civil rulers will be ob|liged to take notice of them, and to bear te&s;timony again&s;t their evil conduct. To this purpo&s;e we may read in Rom. 13. 4. <HI>But if thou do that which is evil be afraid, for he beareth not the &s;word in vain, for he is the mini&s;ter of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> doeth evil.</HI></P>
<P>Let this People then endeavour to &s;ee and be con|vinced of the nece&s;&s;ity and advantage of this; and the di&s;advantage of a non-compliance with this Ex|hortation; and endeavour a due improvement of di|vine ordinances and providences, to further the &s;ame. And let us humbly, earne&s;tly, and per&s;everingly im|plore the plentiful effu&s;ions of the Spirit of grace, which are needful in order hereunto. Let every one take care of him&s;elf re&s;pecting the&s;e things, and con&s;ider how <HI>he</HI> is obliged in his place and relations to further them in others, and &s;ee to it that he doth not neglect his duty.</P>
<P>May we return unfeignedly to God from whom we have departed! Know and &s;erve the God of our fathers with a perfect heart and a willing mind! And may we follow the good examples we have for our imitation upon record in the holy &s;criptures, and tho&s;e of our predece&s;&s;ors in this Land! Yea let our ambition to be truly religious be excited by tho&s;e &s;hining paterns of piety and religion, which are yet (thro' grace) to be ob&s;erved among us.</P>
<P>And I may add, Let none remain under deep &s;ecu|rity in their &s;ins, &amp; unconcerned about being truly reli|gious, whil&s;t there are &s;o many in &s;everal Towns di&s;co|vering their great concern about the &s;tate of their &s;ouls, and are asking that all-concerning Que&s;tion, <HI>What mu&s;t I do to be &s;aved?</HI></P>

But, this is all I &s;hall &s;ay under the fir&s;t Doctrine. The time will allow of but little more than mention|ing tho&s;e that are yet to be &s;poken to.</P>
<P>DOCT. II. <HI>When tho&s;e in civil authority are truly religious, God is won't to be with them, and to e&s;tabli&s;h them in their authority.</HI></P>
<P>When civil rulers are truly religious, when they duly acknowlege God, and pay tho&s;e regards to him that are due to him from them; when they walk in his commandments, &amp; imitate tho&s;e that have done &s;o be|fore them; when they put honour upon his governing authority, by a hearty univer&s;al &amp; per&s;evering obedi|ence to his perceptive will: God is won't graciou&s;ly to reward their fidelity; &s;ignally to own &amp; ble&s;s them. Was it not thus with <HI>Jeho&s;haphat? And the Lord was with Jeho&s;haphat becau&s;e &amp;c. therefore the Lord &s;tabli&s;hed the kingdom in his hand.</HI> The Lord was <HI>with him.</HI> This is a comprehen&s;ive expre&s;&s;ion; and denotes the gracious and favourable pre&s;ence of God with him, and &s;o is in|clu&s;ive of all that is good and de&s;ireable here. <HI>The Lord be with you!</HI> is a very exten&s;ive wi&s;h; abundance of good is comprehended in it. We read frequently of God's being with men both &s;ingly &amp; collectively con&s;idered. Now this is an excellent prayer when made for others, and it is a very de&s;ireable a&s;&s;ertion where we find it concerning any; as we do here in the text. If God be <HI>with</HI> men in the &s;en&s;e of the text, he is al&s;o <HI>for</HI> them? And <HI>if God be for them, who can be again&s;t them.</HI> If God be graciou&s;ly and favoura|bly pre&s;ent with men, they are in the way to be protected, &s;upported, guided, directed, a&s;&s;i&s;ted, quick|ned, encouraged &amp; comforted: they are in the way to be ble&s;&s;ed, and made ble&s;&s;ings. Pious civil rulers, are won't to have God with them. <HI>Hear ye me A&s;a, the Lord is with you whil&s;t you are with him,</HI> 2 Chron. 15. 2. forementioned. Such we find frequently &s;po|ken

Wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ul are the con|&s;equences of God's departing from or for&s;aking of men; and of tho&s;e in civil authority: But very de&s;ireable is the condition of tho&s;e with whom God is. And that he is won't to be with &s;uch as I have been &s;peaking of, we may read further in what is &s;aid concerning that good King <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> in 2 King. 18. 7. <HI>And the Lord was with him, and be pro&s;pered whither&s;oever he went forth.</HI> And as God is wont to be with &s;uch, or to be gracious to them many ways, &s;o he is wont particularly to e&s;tabli&s;h them in their authority. Tho&s;e that are &s;tabli&s;hed &s;trengthn'd and &s;ettled in religion &amp; virtue, and that walk in God's command|ments, he is wont to confirm and continue in their exalted &s;tations. Thus it was with <HI>Jeho&s;haphat. Therefore the Lord &s;tabli&s;hed the kingdom in his band.</HI> <Q>They &s;tand firm (faith Mr. <HI>Henry</HI>) who have the pre&s;ence of God with them.</Q> Such are not wont pre&s;ently to be put down when &s;et up by God. In|deed tho&s;e are unfit and unworthy to rule over men, who are not willing that God &s;hould rule over them; and tho&s;e are &s;ometimes rejected by God. Such as are irreligious and di&s;obedient, God in his Providence rends the kingdom from, and don't &s;uffer them long to rule. See the words of <HI>Samuel</HI> to <HI>Saul,</HI> 1 Sam&punc; 15. 23, &amp; 28.&mdash;<HI>Becau&s;e thou ha&s;t rejected the word of the Lord, the Lord hath al&s;o rejected thee from being king. And Samuel &s;aid unto him, the Lord hath rent the kingdom of I&s;rael from thee this day, and hath gi|ven it to a neighbour of thine that is better than thou.</HI> Indeed, it is God's dominion only that is <HI>Everla&s;ting.</HI> Civil rulers, the highe&s;t and be&s;t of them, mu&s;t not always continue by rea&s;on of death. And &s;uch as &s;erve their generation according to the will of God, as <HI>David</HI> that religious king did, mu&s;t like him fall a&s;leep.

the will of God, fell on &s;leep, and was laid unto his fathers, and &s;aw corruption.</HI> The&s;e, tho' called Gods, yet are but men, they are mortal, as well as other men. P&s;al. 82. 6, 7. <HI>I have &s;aid, ye are gods, and all of you are children of the mo&s;t high. But ye &s;hall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.</HI> But notwith&s;tanding this, &s;uch as &s;tand in awe of God, and of his law, and con&s;cienciou&s;ly comply with it, and endeavour to an&s;wer the ju&s;t expectati|ons of God and men; &s;uch as do their duty con&s;i|dered as rulers of this and that order and dignity; &s;uch are wont to &s;tand firm and unmoved; they are not wont pre&s;ently to be put down from their &s;eats. Such as are obedient to God, and faithful to the cau&s;e of God, and the intere&s;t of his people; &s;uch as don't mi&s;u&s;e their power, betray their tru&s;t, nor &s;a|crifice the publick to a private intere&s;t, but <HI>put on,</HI> and wear <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> as their Garments; as are <HI>a refuge for the oppre&s;&s;ed,</HI> and <HI>a terror to the evil doer;</HI> the&s;e are wont to be e&s;tabli&s;hed in their authority.</P>
<P>I pa&s;s now to &s;ome brief Improvement of this Doctrine.</P>
<P>USE. I. What we have heard <HI>looks favourably upon that people who&s;e rulers are truly religious.</HI></P>
<P>Tho&s;e per&s;ons that are truly religious, don't de|&s;ire to be &s;o alone, but are de&s;irous that others &s;hould be &s;o al&s;o. The honour of God, and the good of others, is what they are concerned for, and they are di&s;po&s;ed to comply with the divine will which is conducive hereto. Civil rulers that are truly religi|ous, are di&s;po&s;ed to &s;et good examples before their people, and to attend the divine will, in their re&s;|pective &s;tations, which is &s;o adapted to promote the intere&s;ts of men: They are inclined to &s;mile upon the vertuous, and to prai&s;e and encourage tho&s;e that do

well, and to be a terror to evil doers. And if God is won't to be with &s;uch, and to e&s;tabli&s;h them in their authority, this gives to tho&s;e that are under them an hopeful pro&s;pect that &s;uch will be great and la&s;ting ble&s;&s;ings to them.</P>
<P>USE. II. This Doctrine teaches us <HI>the great encou|ragement tho&s;e in civil authority, have to be truly religi|ous;</HI> to re&s;pect all the commandments of God, and to attend con&s;cienciou&s;ly what is incumbent on them in their differing places in the Government that they are &s;et in.</P>
<P>But this &s;hall &s;uffice for the &s;econd Doctrine. I proceed now to a third.</P>
<P>DOCT. III. <HI>That &s;ome in the civil Government, thro' the favour of God, and manife&s;t re&s;pect &amp; obedience of the people, have riches and honour in abundance.</HI></P>
<P>This I think is fairly to be gathered from the fifth ver&s;e. <HI>And all Judah brought to Jeho&s;haphat pre&s;ents, and he had riches and honour in abundance. Jeho&s;ha|phat</HI> was happy in the favour of God, in his &s;ignally owning and ble&s;&s;ing of him; as hath been already ob&s;erved from tho&s;e words, <HI>And the Lord was with Jeho&s;haphat:</HI> And tho&s;e, <HI>Therefore the Lord &s;tabli&s;hed the kingdom in his hand.</HI> The favour of God to|wards him is here al&s;o to be ob&s;erved, in the intere&s;t that he gave him in the affections of his people, and in the obedience that they yielded to him as God's mini&s;ter to them for good: both they &amp; others did him abundant honour, and thro' the over-ruling Providence of God, he had <HI>riches</HI> as well as <HI>honour in abundance.</HI> We are told that <HI>all Judah brought to Jeho&s;haphat pre&s;ents</HI> <Q>In acknowledgment of his

&s;ending preachers among them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Henry</HI> in loc.</NOTE>.</Q> <Q>As &s;ubjects in tho&s;e times and places u&s;ed to do to their Kings, as a token of their re&s;pect &amp; &s;ubjection to them<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Poole</HI> in loc.</NOTE></Q> It is &s;aid of <HI>Saul,</HI> That they de&s;pi&s;ed him, and brought him no pre&s;ents. But of <HI>Solomon</HI> it is &s;aid, 1 King. 10. 25. <HI>And they brought every man his pre|&s;ent, ve&s;&s;els of &s;ilver and ve&s;&s;els of gold &amp;c.</HI> And concerning <HI>Hezekiah</HI> we are told, in 2 Chron. 32. 23. <HI>And many brought gifts unto the Lord to Jeru&s;alem, and pre&s;ents to Hezekiah king of Judah, &s;o that he was magnified in the &s;ight of all nations from thenceforth.</HI> Some rulers are highly e&s;teemed by their people, and their re&s;pect is manife&s;ted, both in word and action, in all the cu&s;tomary ways of di&s;covering of it. Re&s;pect and honour are due to tho&s;e in civil autho|rity, and are to be given them for the &s;ake of their office; and it is likely to be greatly increa&s;ed by the due execution of it, and in <HI>this,</HI> they are to be obeyed, and, are wont to have great honour done them by their people, by their &s;ubjection to them herein. Yea, &s;ome there are, whom God is plea&s;ed to reward not only with abundant honour, but with <HI>riches</HI> al&s;o in abundance. Tribute is due to &s;uch, and a good Government is wont to be honourably &s;up|ported. It is highly rea&s;onable that good rulers in the &s;tate, &s;uch as make a bu&s;ine&s;s of di&s;charging what God and men ju&s;tly expect from them in their re&s;pective places, that attend continually upon this very thing, &s;hould be well rewarded by the publick for their good &s;ervices. Rom. 13. 6. <HI>For for this cau&s;e pay you tribute, for they are God's mini&s;ters, at|tending continually upon this very thing.</HI> A &s;mall mat|ter is not &s;ufficient to &s;upport the dignity of their po&s;ts. And God &s;ometimes remarkably rewards the piety and fidelity of &s;ome in civil authority with

great riches. An in&s;tance of this we have in the text. All that I &s;hall add here is this, that it is worthy of our &s;erious ob&s;ervation, what is &s;poken of wi&s;dom, or religion in the purity and power of it, Prov. 3. 16. <HI>Length of days is in her right hand: and in her left hand riches and honour.</HI></P>
<P>All the Improvement that I &s;hall make of this Ob&s;ervation &s;hall be in this one Inference.</P>
<P>Learn we from hence, <HI>How greatly &s;ome civil ru|lers are obliged to lay out them&s;elves in their re&s;pective places, for the glory of God, and the good of his people.</HI> If it be as hath been &s;aid, this Inference is ju&s;t and natural. But this makes my way to the la&s;t Doctrine.</P>
<P>DOCT. IV. and la&s;t. <HI>That &s;ome in civil authority, who have riches and honour in abundance, have their hearts lift up in the ways of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>This honourable account is to be given of &s;ome &s;uch, but not of all. <Q>Riches and honour in abun|dance, proves to many an hindrance in the ways of the Lord, an occa&s;ion of pride, &s;ecurity and &s;en&s;ua|lity, but it had a quite contrary effect upon <HI>Jeho&s;ha|phat.</HI> This abundance was oyl to the wheels of his obedience; and the more he had of the wealth of this world, the more was his heart lifted up in the ways of the Lord. He brought his heart to his work, and lift up his heart in it. He never thought he could do enough for God. He was lively and affectionate in his religion, fervent in &s;pirit, &s;erving the Lord. He was bold and re&s;olute in the ways of God, and went on with courage. His heart was lift|ed up above all di&s;couragements and difficulties that were in the way of his duty<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Henry</HI> in loc.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="003952_0029_1003790E21F6A420">
Indeed we make nothing of our religion and the &s;ervice of God, if we don't make heart-work of it, if we don't heartily engage in it. And &s;ome there are in civil authority, who are devoted to God's fear, and that may &s;ay with the royal P&s;almi&s;t, as in P&s;al. 16. 2. <HI>O my &s;oul, thou ha&s;t &s;aid unto the Lord, Thou art my Lord.</HI> P&s;al. 116. 16. <HI>O Lord truly I am thy &s;ervant.</HI> They con&s;ider the multitude and great|ne&s;s of divine favours and benefits to them, and are de&s;irous to know what they &s;hall do in a way of re|turn to God for them all: Their enquiry is that in ver. 12. of the ju&s;t now mentioned P&s;alm, <HI>What &s;hall I render to the Lord for all his benefits towards me?</HI> They &s;ee them&s;elves obliged to do what they can for God, who hath done &s;o much for them; they are encouraged, and their hearts are enlarged in the &s;ervice of God. They are inclined to God's te&s;ti|monies, and they are the more re&s;olved by divine grace and help to be rich towards God, and to bring what glory they can to the name of God, who hath put &s;uch honour upon them, and given them riches and honour in abundance. They endeavour from hence to be the <HI>better Chri&s;tians,</HI> and the <HI>better Ru|lers.</HI> But this &s;hall &s;uffice here.</P>
<P>And now, from what hath been &s;aid,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>We may &s;ee what the Lord of all, the God of all grace, and the giver of every good gift, doth for &s;ome of the children of men.</HI> He &s;ets &s;ome above others. Some he advances to po&s;ts of honour and &s;ervice. He is with and e&s;tabli&s;heth them in their authority; he gives them riches and honour in abundance, and an heart to honour and &s;erve him, with the more readine&s;s, re&s;olution and chearfulne&s;s. He fortifies &s;ome again&s;t the temptations of a pro&s;perous &s;tate and exalted condition in the world, and makes them &s;hining patterns and examples to others. How ad|mirable
<PB N="27" REF="003952_0030_1003781352DDBE10">
is this grace of God, and how worthy a thankful acknowlegement is this from the receivers of &s;uch grace, and the ob&s;ervers of the &s;ame?</P>
<P N="2">2. This Doctrine teacheth civil rulers <HI>what their ambition &s;hould be;</HI> even to be truly engaged in the &s;ervice of God, and to have their hearts lift up in the ways of the Lord; how they &s;hould improve the di&s;tingui&s;hing favours of God to them, the riches and honour that in his providence he grants them, even to the enlarging their hearts in running the way of his commandments. Tho&s;e in civil authority &s;hould be ambitious of writing after this fair copy. God ju&s;tly expects no &s;mall revenue of glory from &s;uch whom he hath &s;o obliged. He is &s;urely a critical ob&s;erver of &s;uch. P&s;al. 82. 1. <HI>God &s;tandeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the gods.</HI> And &s;uch mu&s;t e're long be called away out of the world to give up their account to him: And happy they who when they have a pro&s;pect of death and judgment as night unto them, are able to look backward with comfort and &s;atis|faction, and forward with joy: Who are able with king <HI>Hezekiah</HI> to &s;ay, as in 2 Kin. 20. 3. <HI>I be&s;eech thee, O Lord, remember now how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy &s;ight.</HI></P>
<P>Thus have I &s;aid &s;omething from, and (I hope) agreable to, the words of my text, after my poor, imperfect manner.</P>
<P>So many of my reverend fathers and brethren have gone before me in this &s;ervice, that there is but little room left to offer any thing proper to the pre|&s;ent occa&s;ion without repetition at lea&s;t of the &s;ame thing. I have therefore omitted many things that I might have mentioned; and &s;hall add no more but an earne&s;t addre&s;s to this <HI>whole People,</HI> both rulers and ruled.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="003952_0031_10037A4068DE6ED0">
Let us <HI>all</HI> be deeply &s;en&s;ible, and thoroughly con|vinced of the nece&s;&s;ity and utility of our being truly religious, and on the other hand, of the evil, dan|ger, manife&s;t unprofitablene&s;s, and manifold di&s;ad|vantages of our being irreligious, or only formali&s;ts in religion; and let us be concerned to have our hearts &s;ound in God's &s;tatutes. Let our aim and endeavour be, to be really, per&s;onally, and relative|ly good. Let us not &s;eek unto <HI>Baalim,</HI> but let us know and acknowlege, wor&s;hip and obey, the living and true God, the God of our fathers, with a per|fect heart and a willing mind; and walk in all his commandments and ordinances blamele&s;s. Let us imitate CHRIST our great pattern, walk in the ways of pious Predece&s;&s;ors, and imitate the graces and vertues of the Saints and People of God upon re|cord in the &s;acred pages, and of our forefathers in this Land. If we do thus, may we not hope, to have God with us, as he was with our fathers, and that he will not leave us nor for&s;ake us, but e&s;tabli&s;h us an holy people to him&s;elf? If we return to the Al|mighty, &s;hall we not be built up, and have the Lord our God nigh unto us in all that we call upon him for? I conclude with that in P&s;al. 85. 9. 12. <HI>Surely his &s;alvation is nigh to them that fear him, that glory may dwell in our land. Yea the Lord &s;hall give that which is good, and our land &s;hall yield her in|crea&s;e.</HI></P>
