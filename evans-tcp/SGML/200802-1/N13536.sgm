<HEAD>SHORT OBSERVATIONS ON <HI>SLAVERY,</HI></HEAD>
<P>Introductory to &s;ome EXTRACTS from the writing of the ABBE RAYNAL, on that important Subject.</P>
<P>WHEN the General Congre&s;s fir&s;t a&s;|&s;embled, they prefaced the rea&s;on of their &s;eparation from Great Britain, with the following &s;entence, <Q>We hold the&s;e truths to be &s;elf evident, That all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator, with certain unaliable rights; that among&s;t the&s;e are life, liber|ty, and the pur&s;uit of happine&s;s.</Q> And in the declaration of the 6th of July 1775, Congre&s;s have in very forcible language declared their opinion <Q>that it was con|trary to the intent of the Divine Author of our exi&s;tence, that a part of the hu|man kind &s;hould hold an ab&s;olute pro|perty and unbounded power over o|thers, marked out by infinite goodne&s;s and wi&s;dom, as the objects of a Legal Domination.&mdash;That reverence for our

great Creator, principles of humanity, and the dictates of common &s;en&s;e, mu&s;t convince all tho&s;e who reflect upon the &s;ubject, that Government was in&s;tituted to promote the welfare of mankind, and ought to be admini&s;tered for the attainment of that end.</Q> As the&s;e re|flections apply to human nature in ge|neral, however diver&s;ified by colour and other di&s;tinctions, how far the &s;ituation of the Negroes &s;till kept in Slavery, on this continent is con&s;onant thereto, is a matter which calls for the mo&s;t &s;erious attention of all tho&s;e who, indeed believe, in a ge|neral Providence, and that the good Au|thor of our being multiplies his ble&s;&s;ings in proportion as we render our&s;elves wor|thy by the practice of Ju&s;tice and Love. Hence it becomes a matter of the utmo&s;t weight to the Americans, in a peculiar manner, duly to con&s;ider how far they can ju&s;tify a conduct &s;o abhorrent from the&s;e &s;acred truths as that of dragging the&s;e oppre&s;&s;ed Strangers from their native land, and all tho&s;e tender connections, which we hold &s;o dear; the violence exerci&s;ed over them, to oblige them to do the &s;ervile offices of life, for tho&s;e who&s;e &s;uperiority has been obtained by an illegal force; under the &s;anction of unju&s;t laws; laws fram|ed

to hold in bondage, a bondage often ri|gorous and cruel, a people over whom they have not the lea&s;t &s;hadow of right; a bondage without condition, without end, and without appeal. Under this pro&s;pect of the &s;ituation of the&s;e Black People, mu&s;t not every &s;en&s;ible, feeling heart be filled with &s;ympathy and fearful appre|hen&s;ions. Well may the words of Scrip|ture be applied to them, <Q>Behold the tears of the oppre&s;&s;ed and they had no comforter;</Q> and indeed, what refuge, what appeal can a &s;lave have, when cruelly u&s;ed by an incon&s;iderate ma&s;ter, or by a hard-hearted over&s;eer. How incon&s;i&s;tent is this abhorrent practice, with every idea of Liberty, every principle of humanity. Nay is it not of publick notoriety that tho&s;e ma&s;ters or over&s;eers, who by ill u&s;age, or by an unrelenting &s;courge, have brought their Slaves to an untimely end, have &s;carce been called to any account, by tho&s;e who ought not to bear the &s;word in vain: Scarce an in&s;tance can be mentioned even of any man's being capitally arraigned for the wilful murder of a &s;lave. Nay, dreadful to mention, do not the laws in &s;ome of the i&s;lands, and frequent adverti&s;ements in the Southern States, in effect encourage the murder of a Negroe, who has ab&s;ented

<P>When this unju&s;t and cruel treatment of the Negroes is con&s;idered, and brought to the te&s;t of the above declarations, will it not appear wonderfully incon&s;i&s;tent and a matter of a&s;toni&s;hment, to the whole world, that an alteration of conduct to|wards them, has not yet taken place, pre|paratory to a general abolition of Slavery on the continent; a &s;tep which every prin|ciple of honour, rea&s;on, and humanity call for, and which may well be effected in &s;uch a manner as will conduce to the happine&s;s of the ma&s;ter as well as the &s;lave. But &s;uch is the force of the habi|tual depravity, when &s;upported by the practice of great numbers, e&s;pecially in that which flatters our intere&s;t and &s;ooths our pa&s;&s;ions, that the mo&s;t &s;triking in&s;tan|ces of oppre&s;&s;ion and cruelty, &s;uch as would make a &s;tranger, at the fir&s;t glance, &s;hudder lo&s;e all their force upon minds accu&s;tomed, from their infancy, to &s;ee op|pre&s;&s;ion reign uncontrouled; the&s;e can &s;ee the galling chains, the cruel &s;tripes; the dying groan without pain; and without reflection or pity, can di&s;regard the heart|rending

&s;uffering, which many of the&s;e their afflicted fellow-men undergo,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A &s;triking in&s;tance of this kind appeared in the ca&s;e of a NEGROE, re&s;iding near PHILADELPHIA. From his fir&s;t arrival he appeared thoughtful and dejected, fre|quently dropping tears, when fondling his ma&s;ter's child|ren; the cau&s;e of which was not known till he was able to be under&s;tood, when he gave the following account. That he had a wife and children in his own country, that &s;ome of the&s;e being &s;ick, he went in the night time to fetch water at a &s;pring, where he was, violently, &s;eized and carried away, by per&s;ons who lay in wait to catch men; from whence he was tran&s;ported to AMERICA; that the remembrance of his family and friends, whom he never expected to &s;ee any more, were the principal cau&s;e of his dejection and grief. Now can any who&s;e mind is not rendered quite obdurate by the practice of oppre&s;&s;ion, or the love of gain, hear this relation without being affected with &s;ympathy and &s;orrow; and doubtle&s;s the ca&s;e of many of the&s;e afflicted people will be found to be attended with circum&s;tances equally tragical and ag|gravating. And if we enquire of tho&s;e Negroes who were brought from their native country, when children, we &s;hall find many of them have been &s;tolen away, when abroad from their parents on the roads, or watching their corn fields. Now TENDER PARENTS; and all who are real friends of LIBERTY; and you who are willing to read the book of Con&s;cience, and tho&s;e that are learned in the law, what can you &s;ay to the&s;e deplorable ca&s;es: When and how have the&s;e oppre&s;&s;ed &s;trangers forfeited their liberty; mu&s;t not your heart a&s;&s;ent to the declara|tion publickly made by a re&s;pectable member of the A&s;|&s;embly of Virginia? <Q>That there cannot be in nature, there is not in hi&s;tory, an in&s;tance in which every right of men is more flagrantly violated.</Q> Does not ju&s;tice loudly call for LIBERTY being re&s;tored to them? Is it not the duty of every di&s;pen&s;er of ju&s;tice, who is not for|getful of his own humanity, to remember that they are men, and to declare them free. Where evils of &s;uch magnitude are neither inquired into nor redre&s;&s;ed by tho&s;e who&s;e duty, it is, <Q>to &s;eek judgment, to relieve the oppre&s;&s;ed, to judge for the fatherle&s;s, and plead for the widow,</Q> I&s;a. i.17. what can be expected but that the groans and cries of the&s;e &s;ufferers will reach HEAVEN, and what &s;hall ye do. <Q>when GOD ri&s;eth up, and when he vi&s;iteth.</Q> What will ye an&s;wer him? Did not he that made them make us; and did not one fa&s;hion us in the womb. Job. xxxi.I4.</NOTE> be|fore the remembrance of pa&s;t enjoyments

and their native vigour and love of liber|ty, can be broke down into tame &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion to the ab&s;olute will of their lordly op|pre&s;&s;ors. No plea of difficulty ought to prevent our &s;peedily doing that ju&s;tice to the&s;e oppre&s;&s;ed people, which the nature of their &s;everal ca&s;es will allow, &s;uch as declaring their offspring free at a &s;uitable age; and in&s;tead of extorting their &s;ervice by &s;everity of di&s;cipline, make way for their freedom, by giving them &s;uch an intere&s;t in their own labour as may &s;tir them up to the utmo&s;t exertion of their vigour and indu&s;try, and encourage them to employ tho&s;e talents and ingenuity, which are now depre&s;&s;ed by &s;lavery, for the general good; thus from grudging dangerous Slaves they may become willing minded labourers, equally concerned with their ma&s;ters in promoting the &s;afety and happine&s;s of their country. It will be when mea&s;ures of this kind takes place in America, and when a final end is put to
<PB N="7" REF="017096_0007_0F9FC488BA560560">
a horrible Slave Trade in England, that both countries may expect to flouri&s;h, un|der the ble&s;&s;ing of Him who delights in Ju&s;tice and Mercy; and has promi&s;ed to reward every country, as well as indivi|dual, according to their deeds.</P>
<P>To a&s;&s;i&s;t in eradicating the deep rooted prejudice which an education among&s;t Slaves has planted in many minds, let us attend to what the Abbe Raynal, that ce|lebrated Philo&s;opher and friend to Man|kind, has &s;aid on the &s;ubject of Slavery.</P>
<P><Q>I will not, &s;ays he, di&s;grace my&s;elf by adding one to the li&s;t of venal writers, who have pro&s;tituted their pens in de|fence of a trade &s;o abhorrent from the laws of universal ju&s;tice. No principles of policy can ju&s;tify the breach of her Sacred Laws. In &s;o enlightened an age, an age where &s;o many errors are boldly laid open, it would be &s;hameful to con|ceal any truth that is intere&s;ting to hu|manity. We will fir&s;t prove that no rea&s;on of &s;tate can authorize Slavery. In doing this we &s;hall not he&s;itate to ar|raign, before the Tribunal of Eternal Light and Ju&s;tice, all tho&s;e governments who tolerate the cruel practice, or are not a&s;hamed to make it the ba&s;is of their
<PB N="8" REF="017096_0008_0F9FC489EEA80FB0">power.</Q> The great Monte&s;quieu could not prevail upon him&s;elf to treat the que&s;tion concerning Slavery, in a &s;erious light. In reality it is degrading to rea|&s;on to employ it. I will not &s;ay in de|fending, but even in refuting an abu&s;e &s;o repugnant to it; whoever ju&s;tifies &s;o odious a &s;y&s;tem de&s;erves the utmo&s;t con|tempt, &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;Will it be &s;aid that he who wants to make me a Slave does me no injury, that he only makes u&s;e of his rights? Where are tho&s;e rights (may the Slave &s;ay) who has &s;tamped upon them &s;o &s;acred a character as to &s;i|lence mine. He who &s;upports the &s;y&s;|tem of Slavery is the enemy of the whole human race. He divides it into two &s;o|cieties of Legal A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, the Oppre&s;&s;or and the Oppre&s;&s;ed, &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;But the right of Slavery, you &s;ay, extends only to the right of labour, and the pri|vation of liberty, not life. What! does not the ma&s;ter who di&s;po&s;es of my &s;trength, at his plea&s;ure, di&s;po&s;e of my life, which depends on the voluntary and moderate exerci&s;e of my faculties: What is exi&s;tence to him who has not the di&s;po&s;al of it? I cannot kill my Slave, but I can make him bleed under the whip of an executioner; I can <Q>over|whelm
<PB N="9" REF="017096_0009_0F9FC48A4E6F3890">
him with &s;orrow, drudgery, and want: I can injure him every way, and &s;ecretly undermine the principles and &s;prings of life: I can &s;mother by &s;low puni&s;hment, the wretched infant which a Negroe Woman carries in her womb. Thus the laws protects the Slave again&s;t a violent death, to leave to my cruelty the right of making him die by degrees.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Let us proceed a &s;tep farther, the right of Slavery is a right to perpetrate all &s;orts of crimes; tho&s;e crimes which in|vade property; for Slaves are not &s;uf|fered to have any, even in their own per&s;ons; tho&s;e crimes which de&s;troy per|&s;onal &s;afety, for the Slave may be &s;acri|ficed to the caprice of his ma&s;ter; tho&s;e crimes which make mode&s;ty &s;hudder; my blood ri&s;es at tho&s;e horrid images. I hate, I &s;ly the human &s;pecies, made up only of victims and executioners, and if it is never to become better, may it an|nihilate it&s;elf. A word more, &s;ince all mu&s;t be &s;aid, Cartouche, the famous (French Highwayman) Cartouche &s;eated at the foot of a tree, in a deep fore&s;t, calculating the profits and charges of his robberies, the rewards and pay of his a&s;&s;ociates, and adju&s;ting with them the idea of proportion and di&s;tributive
<PB N="10" REF="017096_0010_0F9FC48D711DCE88">
ju&s;tice; this Cartouche is he not like a merchant equiping a ve&s;&s;el for the Gui|nea Trade, who reclined on his de&s;k, with his pen in his hand, &s;ettles the num|ber of attacks which he can cau&s;e to be made on the coa&s;t of Guinea, who de|liberately examines how many firelocks each Negroe will co&s;t him, how many iron fetters to confine him on board, how many whips to make him work. What think you of this parallel. The highwayman attacks you and takes your money; the trader carries off even your per&s;on. The one invades the rights of &s;ociety, the other tho&s;e of nature. This certainly is the truth; and if there ex|i&s;ted a religion which authorized, even only by its &s;ilence, &s;uch horrors, if it did not continually denounce vengeance again&s;t the authors or the in&s;truments of this tyranny; if it made it criminal for the Slave to break his bonds; if it &s;uf|fered in its bo&s;om the iniquitous Judge who condemns the fugitive to death; if &s;uch a religion exi&s;ted, the mini&s;ter and the altar ought to be cru&s;hed in one common ruin.</Q></P>
<P>The &s;ame Author makes a farther note (which is left out in the Engli&s;h Tran&s;la|tion) upon the arguments frequently ad|vanced
<PB N="11" REF="017096_0011_0F9FC48E67694778">by &s;ome, even teachers under dif|ferent denominations, in vindication of the Slavery of the Negroes, as being the ef|fects of the cur&s;es denounced again&s;t Cain or Canaan, who&s;e de&s;cendants they &s;up|po&s;e them to be; in 4 vol. p. 158, French Edit. <Q>Great God, &s;ays the Abbe, what attrocious extravagancies are imputed to thee, by beings who &s;peak and act only by a free gift of thy power; who a&s;cribe to thee words and actions agreeable to the ridiculous caprice of their ignorant pre&s;umption. Are they Devils who bla&s;pheme thee, or men who call them|&s;elves thy mini&s;ters.</Q> Philo. Hi&s;t. of the Indies.</P>
<P>The writer of the foregoing introduc|tory ob&s;ervations, i.e. A. Benezet, teacher of a &s;chool e&s;tabli&s;hed by private &s;ub&s;crip|tion, in Philadelphia, for the in&s;truction of the Black Children and others of that people, has, for many years, had oppor|tunity of knowing the temper and genius of the Africans; particularly of tho&s;e un|der his tuition, who have been many, of different ages; and he can with Truth and Sincerity declare, that he has found a|mong&s;t them as great variety of Talents, equally capable of improvement, as a|mong&s;t a like number of Whites; and he
<PB N="12" REF="017096_0012_0F9FC48EDF82D178">
is bold to a&s;&s;ert, that the notion entertained by &s;ome, that the Blacks are inferior to the Whites in their capacities, is a vulgar pre|judice, founded on the Pride or Ignorance of their lordly Ma&s;ters, who have kept their Slaves at &s;uch a di&s;tance, as to be unable to form a right judgment of them.</P>
<P>&rindx; In the HOUR OF REFLECTION, that awful hour which will come upon all, not hardned in obduracy or &s;unk in &s;tu|pidity, when people are &s;o far brought to them&s;elves, as impartially to review the tran&s;actions of their pa&s;t life, how much comfort will it afford to tho&s;e, who lay|ing a&s;ide all views of intere&s;t, have la|boured by precept and example to de|preciate and remove an evil of &s;o deep a die, an evil &s;o big with dreadful con|&s;equences to their Country, to them&s;elves, and yet more &s;o to their unhappy offspring, thereby made a prey to that &s;loth and idlene&s;s, that pride, cruelty and laciviou&s;|ne&s;s, the natural produce of SLAVERY.</P>
<P>On the other hand, what ANGUISH OF SOUL, what Reflection from others, will at &s;uch a period be the portion of tho&s;e who for &s;elfi&s;h ends, in order to &s;up|port a life of Pride and Luxury, will have &s;tifled the Convictions of Con&s;cience, in favour of a practice as pregnant with ruin of every kind, as it is incon&s;i&s;tent with every idea of Rea&s;on, Feeling and Humanity.</P>
