<HEAD>A Second LETTER TO Merchant in LONDON, Concerning a late Combination in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay in New-Eng|land, to impo&s;e or force a private Currency, called LAND BANK MONEY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ABove you have a Copy of mine, <HI>February</HI> 21&s;t per <HI>Skinner.</HI> I am ex|treamly glad, that I can &s;end you &s;o &s;oon, the An&s;wer of the Board, as the Directors of this <HI>Combination,</HI> or <HI>Bubble,</HI> call them|&s;elves, to that Letter.</P>
<P>I imagine, that when you have peru&s;ed what they have printed in our News-Papers, and in their inclo&s;ed An&s;wer, you may be apt to think, that without any Interpo&s;ition of the Government, this <HI>Bubble</HI> would have died a natural Death: <HI>The Managers appearing too weak, and too little ac|quainted with the World, to carry on an Affair, la|bouring under &s;o many Difficulties and Di&s;advanta|ges.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="004800_0002_100DF188260FCA28">
The Sub&s;tance of the following Lines, is in it &s;elf obvious to a Gentleman of your Di&s;cern|ment; but for the Benefit of the blinded and deluded Multitude, I am obliged to be plain and particular.</P>
<P>Nothing is more popular than a <HI>pretended Pa|trioti&s;m,</HI> to cover the mo&s;t <HI>iniquitous Schemes.</HI> It grieves good People to find &s;ome who have no|thing, le&s;s at Heart than the publick Good of the Province, to &s;et up for Patriots, by hypocri|tical Harangues to the Multitude upon all Oc|ca&s;ions; &s;uch who have formerly been very ob|noxious: Witne&s;s, the <HI>mi&s;chievous</HI> and <HI>chargeable Differences,</HI> between Governour <HI>Shute,</HI> and our A&s;&s;emblies; Governour <HI>Shute's Six Complaints</HI> again&s;t the Province, and a con&s;equential <HI>Ex|planatory curtailing Charter:</HI> Such who at pre&s;ent, as if re&s;olute, <HI>in provinciae perniciem</HI> are per&s;wa|ding the good People, (<HI>naturally and ever Loyal</HI> but when debauch'd by evil-minded Men) to run counter to <HI>Re&s;olves of Parliament,</HI> to <HI>Reports of the proper Boards,</HI> to <HI>King's In&s;tructions,</HI> and to <HI>repeated Proclamations of our Provincial Government:</HI> Such, who in expectation of a little ill acquired Self-Intere&s;t, are willing to forfeit the Remains of our Charter, and all other Priviledges; <HI>having little or nothing to lo&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Can it be imagined, by any impartial &s;ober thinking Man, if <HI>&s;uch Schemes</HI> were for the general Good of the Country, that Gentlemen who&s;e larges Intere&s;ts here oblige them to &s;tudy &amp; pro|mote the Good of the Country, &s;hould &s;o vigo|rou&s;ly oppo&s;e it: This in not a Difference from Humour, Caprice, or blind civil or eccle&s;ia&s;tick party Rage: It is Self Pre&s;ervation; <HI>that We may not be defrauded of our Properties, by a Combination or Band of&mdash;.</HI> In &s;hort, the Struggle is generally
<PB N="3" REF="004800_0003_100DF189B3170A60">
between the <HI>Creditor</HI> and <HI>Debtor</HI> part of the Pro|vince. The <HI>Debtors</HI> &s;ay, in effect, We have had a Meeting, and are combined and re&s;olved, to pay only &s;o much in the Pound, at a long For|bearance, by a bare-faced, fraudulent Contrivance; The Creditors to prevent this, are laudably con|triving to di&s;&s;olve this Combination.</P>
<P>How undutifully, and unnaturally, do they expo&s;e this Country, by &s;training a Point in their own Favour. Thus, the <HI>lower Hou&s;e</HI> of A&s;|&s;embly acted not again&s;t it, therefore their Al|lowance of it is nece&s;&s;arily implied, and con&s;e|quently the <HI>Combination</HI> is ju&s;t and legal; not|with&s;tanding the mo&s;t explicit Re&s;olves and Re|ports in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and Proclamations here again&s;t it. They give a long and particular De|tail of a Tran&s;action, which the real Well-wi&s;hers to the Province wi&s;h buried in Oblivion. The Members of all Bodies Politick, as well as Na|tural, are &s;ubject to flight Indi&s;po&s;itions, without any Danger to the Con&s;titution. It is true, &s;ay they, the <HI>Governor and Council</HI> deemed the Combi|nation irregular and i&s;&s;ued their Proclamations again&s;t the Currency of their &s;ham Money; but &s;ome thought otherwi&s;e, and took it: In &s;hort, they &s;eem to intimate, that &s;ince they have put their Hands to the Plough, &amp;c&mdash;. They give out that the <HI>Governor and Council are no Go|vernment,</HI> properly &s;o called; are we in a State of Nature, or Anarchy, when the General A&s;|&s;embly is not &s;itting?</P>
<P>I beg Leave to produce &s;ome <HI>authentick In&s;tances of our Provincial Governments Vigilancy,</HI> in this Af|fair of the greate&s;t Con&s;equence: The <HI>late Gene|ral A&s;&s;embly</HI> in their Se&s;&s;ions <HI>March</HI> la&s;t, re&s;olved, <Q>That the&s;e Notes are upon &s;o <HI>&s;lender a Founda|tion,</HI> that the Circulation of them, among the

People of this Province, may have a great Ten|dency to <HI>depreciate</HI> the Bills of Credit already circulating, and con&s;equently to <HI>endamage</HI> his Maje&s;ty's good Subjects as to their <HI>Properties.</HI></Q>&mdash;The <HI>Governor and Council,</HI> by a Proclama|tion, 17th <HI>July</HI> la&s;t, <Q>Tending to <HI>defraud</HI> Men of their Sub&s;tance, and to <HI>di&s;turb</HI> the Peace and good Order of the People, and to give great <HI>Interruption,</HI> and bring much <HI>Confu&s;ion</HI> into their Bu&s;ine&s;s.</Q>&mdash;The Governor in his Speech to our A&s;&s;embly, 22d <HI>November</HI> la&s;t, <Q>This Scheme appears, to the Governor and Coun|cil, <HI>big with &s;o many Mi&s;chiefs</HI> to the People&mdash;to take Notes for Money, which have <HI>no hone&s;t or &s;olid Foundation</HI>&mdash;and in the End <HI>ruinous to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors.</HI></Q>&mdash;Mr. <HI>Belcher</HI> in his late Speech to the A&s;&s;embly of his other Government, <HI>New Hamp&s;hire, </HI> <Q>A <HI>Combination</HI> of Per&s;ons to e|mit a large Quantity of STAMPT PAPER, (an Expre&s;&s;ion of good Propriety) to pa&s;s in Lieu of Money, upon a <HI>ba&s;e and fraudulent Founda|tion.</HI></Q></P>
<P>People may, by the by, ob&s;erve, that the <HI>Scur|rilities,</HI> as they call them, of our Letter, are only the &s;ame <HI>Epithets</HI> u&s;ed by the Government here, and by the Boards at Home. The Board of Trade by way of Complaint, &s;ay, "That the <HI>Governor</HI> had &s;ent a Me&s;&s;age to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Repre&s;enta|tives,</HI> and they refu&s;ed to pay any Regard there|to&mdash;The <HI>Illegality</HI> of the Scheme, and the great <HI>Confu&s;ion</HI> that mu&s;t attend it&mdash;a <HI>pernicious</HI> Scheme of <HI>dangerous</HI> Tendency, and mu&s;t create great <HI>In|terruption</HI> and <HI>Confu&s;ion</HI> in Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Truth</HI> is the only <HI>Author</HI> or <HI>Authority</HI> which we own. Becau&s;e the Peice &s;ent you was wrote in an <HI>epi&s;tolary Manner,</HI> they a&s;cribe to one Per&s;on, <HI>the joint Sentiments</HI> of many of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable
<PB N="5" REF="004800_0005_100DF18D5F45EBA0">
Gentlemen, Merchants, and others, of this Province, <HI>&s;tudious of its Welfare;</HI> and do in a mo&s;t unmannerly, vulgar, mean and fal&s;e Way calum|niate a Gentleman of his Maje&s;ty's Council here: Their Expre&s;&s;ions are too gro&s;s to bear a Repe|tition.</P>
<P>I.<HI>The&s;e Directors, in their An&s;wer, cannot help ex|po&s;ing the Bubble.</HI> The proper Attributes or Marks of a Bubble, are to be found in every Page.</P>
<P N="1">1 In the Title Page, they call it <HI>the Manufac|tory Undertaking.</HI> They have &s;et up no Manu|factory of any Kind, they have not &s;o much as projected any, except the <HI>manufacturing of ba&s;e Bills,</HI> or Money, from Plates, Paper and Ink. In all Nations, and their Provinces, there are three Branches of Bu&s;ine&s;s, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>Trade,</HI> the mo&s;t profi|table; <HI>Manufactures;</HI> and <HI>Produce;</HI> the lea&s;t lu|crative, but the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>They fir&s;t &s;et out upon the Footing of Pro|duce or Land, and called them&s;elves the <HI>Land Bank.</HI> Afterwards upon more mature Delibera|tion, they called it the <HI>Manufactory Undertaking,</HI> (the Words of the Title Page) as being a better <HI>bubbling</HI> Name: And lately having &s;ent &s;ome &s;mall Ventures, BILKT <HI>from the Graziers, and Hog Drivers,</HI> to Sea, upon the Partners Ri&s;que. The Directors may now call them&s;elves, a <HI>Board of Trade and Navigation:</HI> Or rather the <HI>Combination</HI> may a&s;&s;ume this Name, <HI>The Grand Company of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay in New England for Land, for Manufacture, and for Trade and Navigation,</HI> with a Power of &s;etting &amp; fixing the Rate of Intere&s;t; and letting Money at &s;aid Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>This is a &s;hort Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Farce,</HI> which of it &s;elf is <HI>ridiculous and contemptible;</HI> but their
<PB N="6" REF="004800_0006_100DF18F45A8BB00">
Numbers require the <HI>Circum&s;pection</HI> of the Govern|ment, to prevent Mutiny, Sedition and Riots.</P>
<P>If we could &s;uppo&s;e their Bills to obtain a Cur|rency, the Con&s;equence would be ruinous.</P>
<P>Their Bills are founded, as they &s;ay, upon the be&s;t Security, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> Land Security: But by their Articles, this Security <HI>le&s;&s;ens five per Cent. per Ann.</HI> and after 20 Years entirely vani&s;hes; the 600,000 in Bills being &s;till current, (for by their fraudu|lent, tho' weakly contrived Scheme, their Bills are never to be cancelled) hath <HI>lo&s;t its Land Secu|rity,</HI> and is no more a Land Bank, but a <HI>Bank of in&s;olvent Directors:</HI> that is, a Bankruptcy en&s;ues, and the poor Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of their Bills will be the inextricable Sufferers; for the Rich, and Men of Experience in Bu&s;ine&s;s, are in no Danger of be|ing cheated, where the Fraud is &s;o obvious.</P>
<P>The 8 <HI>per Cent. per Ann.</HI> including the 3 <HI>per Cent.</HI> at Intere&s;t, if it could be &s;uppo&s;ed, paid in punc|tually by the Sub&s;cribers; the <HI>Directors</HI> in the Space of 12 or 13 Years, would have the whole or full <HI>Value</HI> of the 600,000 <HI>l.</HI> in their own Hands, to be improved, if they plea&s;e, <HI>for their own &s;ole Benefit;</HI> becau&s;e in the Nature of the Scheme no Part of it is ever to be cancelled, but to be im|proved in Trade, or by Bonds at Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>They frankly acknowledge their <HI>Incapacity, as to Trade,</HI> and that Banks, legally con&s;tituted, ought not to Trade; but they being under no legal Re&s;trictions, the <HI>Directors</HI> think that by in|volving the Partner&s;hip in Trade, they will have a greater Latitude of Ch&mdash;</P>
<P>N. B. <HI>The&s;e initial Letters are no de&s;igned Pun, upon the Name of One of the Directors.</HI></P>
<P>2dly, All Notes, publick or private, which are not a ready-money Tender in Law, ought to be, and are, according to the Cu&s;tom of Merchants
<PB N="7" REF="004800_0007_100DF192381D4BA0">
and Trade&s;men, received in pay, at a Di&s;count, according to the Di&s;tance of Payment, or effec|tual Demand in Law. The&s;e Notes are for 20 Years, therefore they are &s;o many Years Intere&s;t at 6 <HI>per Cent. wor&s;e than ready Money;</HI> but the In|tere&s;t, exceeding the Principal, the&s;e Land Bank Notes or Bills are in ready Money worth no|thing, with an additional <HI>Cheat.</HI> The <HI>Infatuation</HI> of receiving, and paying away &s;uch Notes, may obtain among the Deluded for a &s;hort time; but in the Nature of Things cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t long: And the <HI>Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors will &s;uffer the entire Lo&s;s,</HI> except|ting what may be recovered from the &s;mall E&s;tates of the Signers: Then the Projectors and Mana|gers, who at this Time excite the Populace a|gain&s;t their Well-wi&s;hers and be&s;t Friends, will them&s;elves become the Objects of the <HI>popular Rage.</HI></P>
<P>The Signers are not capable to make good to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors but a very &s;mall Part of the Value. As to the main pretended Security of <HI>Covenants and </HI> JUGGLES <HI>among the Partner&s;hip and Directors,</HI> they may indulge or relea&s;e one another at Plea&s;ure: Actions of Covenant broken, can only be among the GANG, without Regard to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. There is nothing, in the Face of the Bill, a&s;cer|tain'd to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, but <HI>Goods of an arbitrary A&s;&s;ortment and Price; not effectually demandable till after Twenty Years.</HI></P>
<P>We have a fre&s;h and publickly well vouched In&s;tance in Mr. <HI>Samuel Allen of Manche&s;ter, a Part|ner, refu&s;ing to accept in Payment their own Bank Bills.</HI> The Directors, by a publick Adverti&s;ement, do not deny the Fact; but with a Quibble or Eva|&s;ion do affirm, That a few of the Partners refu|&s;ing it, is not properly the Partner&s;hip refu&s;ing it. Every Individual of them being under Co|venant
<PB N="8" REF="004800_0008_100DF1945038C948">
to receive it, and their not publi&s;hing at the &s;ame time their Intention of &s;uing him for <HI>Covenant broken,</HI> is a notorious In&s;tance of their indulging or relea&s;ing one another at Plea&s;ure. In the&s;e Times of a Scarcity of <HI>Medium,</HI> good Money is readily embraced by every Body. Where a Per&s;on by Quibbles refu&s;es Money, &s;ay|ing, I chu&s;e not to receive it now, but at another Time; I will not receive it by the Hands of &s;uch a one, but by the Hands of &s;uch a one; tho' both equally authentick: I will not receive it in &s;uch a Manner, but after &s;ome other Manner, &amp;c. Such Triflings in the common Way of Dealing would nece&s;&s;arily infer, that the Money, or this Sort of Pay, was not agreeable or good. Not only <HI>private Per&s;ons</HI> of the Partner&s;hip, but their <HI>Board of Directors refu&s;e their own Bills.</HI> The mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential Clau&s;e in the Face of their Bills, to pro|cure them a current Credit is, That <HI>they &s;hall be received for any Stock in their Trea&s;ury.</HI> There are to be found there at pre&s;ent, a few Things EN|VEIGLED from &s;ome weak, unthinking Per&s;ons. When People bring their own Bank Bills to pur|cha&s;e any of the&s;e Commodities, they <HI>refu&s;e the&s;e Bills by &s;undry flat, bare-faced Eva&s;ions:</HI> Such as, We are not at Lei&s;ure, We have no &s;uch Goods. If Provi&s;ions, for In&s;tance, are called for, their An&s;wer is, that they are to be &s;hip'd off, but not to be &s;old here: Deal Boards being demanded, they &s;ay, that they are to be &s;old for Rum, Mo|la&s;&s;es, Sugar, &amp;c. as having Occa&s;ion for &s;uch Things; but not for Land Bank Money, not ha|ving Occa&s;ion for any Money at pre&s;ent, &amp;c, &amp;c, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The Partners to expect Dividends of 3 per Cent. per Aun. on the Principal;</HI> whereas the Charge of Management will &s;ink 2 per Cent. of this, the
<PB N="9" REF="004800_0009_100DF195ECDFBB60">
Directors giving 1 <HI>per Cent</HI> more than the Mar|ket Price, for Produce and Manufactures, and &s;elling 1 <HI>per Cent</HI> under the Market Price, is in all 4 <HI>per Cent.</HI> that is, in&s;tead of a Dividend there mu&s;t be a Call or <HI>Lo&s;s of one per Cent among&s;t the Partners.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Having chalkt out a <HI>Phantom,</HI> or built a Ca&s;tle in the Air, they endeavour to per&s;wade the Credulous, that the Scheme is real, good, and in every Re&s;pect will fini&s;hed. <HI>The fir&s;t Year there will be a va&s;t Stock of 46,000 <HI>l,</HI> in their Trea&s;ury.</HI> If they expected their Bubble to live longer than one Year, they &s;hould have carried &s;o gro&s;s a Deception further forward. Of the Principal 5 <HI>per Cent.</HI> paid in is 30,000 <HI>l.</HI> one Years Intere&s;t of 600,000 <HI>l.</HI> at 3 <HI>per Cent.</HI> is 18,000 <HI>l.</HI> in all 48,000 <HI>l</HI> out of this 4 <HI>per Cent.</HI> on the Principal of 600,000 <HI>l.</HI> is sunk, as above, remains 24,000 <HI>l.</HI> from this deduct Deficiencies of a generally in|&s;olvent Partner&s;hip ( if they pay their former Debts) there will remain a very &s;mall Stock to circulate a large Sum of 600,000 <HI>l.</HI> a &s;lender Foun|dation for &s;o large a Structure; but Ca&s;tles in the Air require no Foundation.</P>
<P>We &s;hall encrea&s;e our Produce (this would have been Banter from any but them&s;elves) in a &s;hort Time, &s;o as to Ballance all Accompts with <HI>Europe,</HI> con&s;equently there will be no demand for Silver; Silver, that irreconcilable Enemy to Pa|per Money and Bubbles. When poor People can have pre&s;ent Money (tho' only nominal) on &s;o ea&s;y Terms, and not effectually payable until after 20 Years, can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that they will be a&s;|&s;iduous in Labour to increa&s;e our Produce and Manufacture? No, they will become <HI>Idlers</HI> and <HI>Extravagant,</HI> that is, they will increa&s;e our Im|ports, (it is the Con&s;umers finally, not the Venders
<PB N="10" REF="004800_0010_100DF1984C7A1398">
or Merchants who increa&s;e our Impo&s;ts; and in fact, <HI>where &s;umptuary Laws</HI> take Place, they are <HI>levelled again&s;t the Con&s;umers or Wearers)</HI> and entail their Debts upon Po&s;terity.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>In their Trea&s;ury will be Choice of Variety of Goods; therefore their Bills are better than Ca&s;h Notes or Bonds, which are re&s;tricted to one Specie,</HI> <ABBR>viz</ABBR> Sil|ver. This is an Argument &s;carce to be u&s;ed with a Fool or a Child; it is in favour of Shop Notes, which Trade&s;men &amp; Artificers well know to their Sorrow to be 25 to 50 <HI>per Cent.</HI> wor&s;e than Ca&s;h; and at pre&s;ent their Bills &s;uffer a greater Di&s;|count than do Shop Notes. The <HI>Nova Scotia Wheat,</HI> the beginning of <HI>January</HI> la&s;t; and the <HI>Di|rectors Logwood,</HI> the beginning of this current <HI>March,</HI> bought and &s;old by the Directors, at a <HI>great Di&s;count upon their Land Bank Bills,</HI> is noto|rious.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>They value them&s;elves upon their Bills being a Currency which will not be hoarded up.</HI> This Argument holds al&s;o good in the Ca&s;e of Counterfeits and refu&s;e Bills; if a wor&s;e or le&s;s valuable Cur|rency could be contrived, they al&s;o would be hoarded; but in this Re&s;pect they are &s;afe. Where there are &s;everal concomitant Currencies, that which is generally commercial, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Silver, will be &s;hipt off; and of the local, or provincial Currencies, the mo&s;t valuable will be hoarded up; and the ba&s;er only, if in &s;ufficient Quantities, will be SHUFFLED from Hand to Hand, as a com|mon Currency. Thus if this bubbling Money &s;hould take place, publick Bills will be hoarded,</P>
<P N="7">7. In General they &s;ay, <HI>It has many good Effects of a Currency, and particularly mention, only its paying off &s;mall Debts, in an In&s;tance of ten Actions in all to the Value of 20 l prevented thereby.</HI> No Per|&s;on ventures to take it for large Debts, a few In|&s;tances
<PB N="11" REF="004800_0011_100DF19AA33EDB90">
of Collu&s;ion excepted. A parallel Ca&s;e happened in the Province of <HI>Main,</HI> about two Years &s;ince, &s;ome Thou&s;ands of Pounds, in <HI>Webb's Counterfeit</HI> five Pound <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> Bills, were paid away and received for a con&s;iderable Time, not|with&s;tanding they were generally known to be Counterfeits.</P>
<P>I cannot avoid, by the by, mentioning their <HI>Indi&s;cretion in bringing the late</HI> New-Hamp&s;hire <HI>Paper Money Bubble upon the Stage,</HI> which tho upon a better Footing, died a natural Death in its In|fancy; the Signers and Undertakers refu&s;ing to take it in Payments. Our pre&s;ent Bubble lan|gui&s;hes in the &s;ame Malady, &s;ome of the Direc|tors, and others of the Partner&s;hip, refu&s;ing it, as may be &s;een in our News Papers.</P>
<P N="8">8. To prevent the apprehended Confu&s;ions, they mode&s;tly propo&s;e, <HI>that Authority &s;hould give this Undertaking a Sanction.</HI> An <HI>Act of Indemnity</HI> is more than they may expect. This would be giving a Sanction to Confu&s;ion, to prevent Con|fu&s;ion; to e&s;tabli&s;h Robbery to prevent the Crime of Robbery; to e&s;tabli&s;h Iniquity by Law, for the Benefit of a few evil-minded Men, to the great Damage of this Country, and of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Merchants trading to <HI>New England,</HI> and to entail Mi&s;ery upon our Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t odious and obnoxious Qualification of a Combination, is the <HI>Formidablene&s;s of their Number:</HI> In&s;tead of u&s;ing any Policy to palliate their Numbers, they boldly a&s;&s;ert, that they are ten times more than we imagine, with a va&s;t Number of Military Officers, and Go&s;pel Mini|&s;ters. The <HI>Directors,</HI> perhaps little acquainted with the Propriety of Words, and Decency of Things, <HI>a&s;&s;ume the Stile of the King in Council, and other Boards in Great Britain,</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> At a Board, &amp;c.

II. <HI>Their &s;pecifick An&s;wers to &s;undry Particulars in our Letter, are &s;illy, weak Quibbles, Subterfuges Eva&s;ions, or de&s;igned</HI> (I &s;hall not u&s;e the gro&s;s vulgar Word Fal|&s;ities) <HI>Mi&s;takes.</HI></P>
<P>They &s;ay, 1&s;t, <HI>Our various Paper Currencies occa&s;ion no more Confu&s;ion here, than Variety of Coins do in</HI> Eu|rope; not con&s;idering, that the various expre&s;&s;ed Va|lues in the Faces of the Bills, differ by various fluctua|ting Di&s;counts, from their actual current Values. As to the <HI>new Projections of private Currencies,</HI> if every Per&s;on were to be in a State of Nature as to Currencies, to receive and pay away at what Rate he plea&s;es, and &s;hould have no Rea&s;on to complain, becau&s;e it is his own free Act; what inexpre&s;&s;ible Confu&s;ion would this make in a Community.</P>
<P>If our <HI>Town&s;hips</HI> are &s;uch independent lawle&s;s Corpo|rations, to vote <HI>Land-Bank Bubbles,</HI> Tobacco-Papers, or any Thing they plea&s;e for <HI>Town-Rates;</HI> an Act of A&s;|&s;embly would be very &s;ea&s;onable for their better Regu|lation.</P>
<P>2dly, <HI>It was not the Merchants, but the Officers and Servants of the Government, who gave the publick Trea&s;u|ry Notes a Currency.</HI> It was the Merchants, Trade&s;men, and Ar<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">cers, who received them from the Servants of the Government, made them current. The Partners in this Combination, receiving their Quotas of Land-Bank Bills from the Directors, is not giving them a Cur|rency, (for thus there would be no Doubt of their Cur|rency) It is the People who receive them from the Partners that give them a Currency.</P>
<P>3dly, <HI>Too great a Proportion of our Land&punc; Men going to Sea, is the Rea&s;on why our Country is &s;o poor.</HI> In <HI>Great Britain</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> many going to Sea, is the Rea&s;on of the&s;e Countries being &s;o rich: Hands in Trade earn more than by common Labour. It is one of their <HI>Pa|radoxes,</HI> That too many Hands are employed at Sea: Trade in all Countries is more profitable than Produce: Moreover, a Nur&s;ery of Seamen is what the Briti&s;h Go|vernment are obliged to have always at Heart.</P>
<P>4thly, <HI>Regiments of veteran Officers re&s;igning rather than obey the Governour's Proclamations, is a publick Ca|lamity.</HI> Where Officers, civil or military, deny the Or|ders
<PB N="13" REF="004800_0013_100DF19ED1164C50">
of their Con&s;tituents, their Superiors in di&s;charge of their Duty, and Tru&s;t, cannot avoid &s;u&s;pending or di&s;mi&s;&s;ing of them. I &s;hall not play the Pedant, by ob|&s;erving, That <HI>Veteran</HI> is applicable to Troops, not to Officers; the proper Expre&s;&s;ion is, old experienced Of|ficers, which is never applied to militia Officers. Their whole Piece is full of Improprieties in Diction.</P>
<P>The Managers &s;piriting the People to Mutiny, Sedi|tion and Riots; they call &s;ome Strokes on the Merchant, by Abu&s;e extorted.</P>
<P>5thly, <HI>In an&s;wer to the Va&s;tne&s;s of the unlimited Sum of their Bills,</HI> They &s;ay, All State&s;men agree, That Money can never be too plenty, while it does not rent under Six per Cent. per Annum; but we have made a Rule, not to let it under Six per Cent. therefore we can never make too much of it. This from a vi&s;ionary Bed|lamite would de&s;erve Compa&s;&s;ion, but from a BARE-FA|CED CHEAT, the highe&s;t Indignation: As if they could procure an Act of A&s;&s;embly, that no Money &s;hall be let at Intere&s;t but by this Combination, and with the above imaginary engro&s;&s;ing of Produce, Manufactures, Trade and Navigation; would per&s;wade the Populace, That they have al&s;o engro&s;&s;ed the Affair of letting Money at Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>6thly, <HI>The large Quantity of their Land-Bank Bills cannot depreciate our Province Bills, becau&s;e after one Year there will be none of the&s;e exi&s;tant.</HI> This is an un|pardonable <HI>Eva&s;ion</HI> in &s;ome of the Directors, who mu&s;t know that there are con&s;iderably more than 100,000<HI>l.</HI> of Province Bills extant, not a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the Emi&s;&s;ion Acts, and may, as formerly be po&s;tponed at Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>They (tho' incon&s;i&s;tently with them&s;elves) well ob|&s;erve in another Place, That the large and frequent E|mi&s;&s;ions of Paper Money, &s;ick their own Credit, and in|crea&s;e the Nece&s;&s;ity of making more, by continued increa&s;ing Quantities to make good the continued depreci|ating Qualities of the &s;ame: And thus by a continued Progre&s;&s;ion, render the Quantity va&s;tly great, and the Quality or Value contemptibly &s;mall; This is the un|an&s;werable Argument again&s;t increa&s;ing Paper Cur|rencies.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="004800_0014_100DF1A1128AB440">
7thly, The Objection of their emitting any enor|mous Quantity of the&s;e Bills, and of more MONEY|MAKING Companies &s;etting up, &s;o as to render them too plenty, and con&s;equently a Drug, or too cheap; they &s;ay that a Law may be made to prevent this Licentiou&s;|ne&s;s. This An&s;wer implies, a Condemnation from their own Mouths, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> That until &s;uch a Law is made, their Combination is irregular and mi&s;chievous.</P>
<P>8thly, <HI>The wicked corrupt Principle alledged, mu&s;t be in the Projectors,</HI> J. C. <HI>and Others, but not in the pre|&s;ent Managers, the Directors, the Con&s;titution being &s;etled before their Management commenced.</HI> A bad Memory is of bad Implication: In another Place they tell us, It is not the &s;ame Scheme with the fir&s;t projected, which was found Fault with by the former General A&s;&s;embly; but a new Model contrived by the pre&s;ent Directors, with|out any general Meeting.</P>
<P>9thly, <HI>The Managers had not given proper Security for their good Management and Quota of Bills, becau&s;e very bu&s;y: They cannot be more particular in an An&s;wer to the alledged Irregularities and other Difficulties in their Scheme, becau&s;e their Lei&s;ure does not permit.</HI> This feigned Hurry of Mind, is no good Symptom in their Favour. <HI>It is a mo&s;t flagrant,</HI> ABANDON'D <HI>Impo&s;ition,</HI> to tell the World, that Securities for mo&s;t of the Quotas of the Directors, are to be found upon Record, 21&s;t <HI>Fe|bruary</HI> la&s;t, the Date of our Letter. In the County of <HI>Suffolk</HI> are Five of the Nine Directors: Upon Enquiry, None of their Mortgages were then upon P<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">ord; but being alarm'd, <HI>Samuel Watts</HI> enters his Mortgages 23d <HI>February, Peter Chardon</HI> 5th of <HI>March,</HI> and <HI>Samuel Adams</HI> 7th of <HI>March;</HI> the others, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> Judge <HI>Auchmuty's</HI> (CHAIRMAN) and <HI>William Stoddard's</HI> not yet entered.</P>
<P>10thly, <HI>The Directors are not in Pepetuity, becau&s;e removable for Mi&s;demeanor: And when thus turned out, they have no Part in the Negative; therefore the Direc|tors have no Negative in Re&s;olves of a general Meeting.</HI> Such &s;illy Quibbles are an Argument again&s;t the Un|dertaking with Men of Sen&s;e. A Patentee in Office, tho' liable to be turned out for Mi&s;demeanour, is not|with&s;tanding called a Patentee for Life. Can the Go|vernour of a Province be &s;aid to have no Negative in
<PB N="15" REF="004800_0015_100DF1A29E5526E8">
their General A&s;&s;emblies, becau&s;e he may be &s;uper&s;ed or di&s;mi&s;s'd? Such childi&s;h Quibbles are unbecoming a BOARD.</P>
<P>11thly, <HI>That the Bills bear no Intere&s;t to the Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ors is notoriou&s;ly fal&s;e; becau&s;e the Mortgagers pay to the Partner&s;hip,</HI> that is, to them&s;elves, 3 <HI>per Cent. per Ann.</HI> This is trifling to an unpardonable Degree. The Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ors of the Bills have no Benefit from this: The Partner&s;hip it&s;elf, notwith&s;tanding of this 3 per Cent, run yearly One per Cent. in Debt, as is before demon&s;trated.</P>
<P>12thly, <HI>The Partners have received a valuable Con|&s;ideration</HI> for their Mortgages, becau&s;e the Signers, as I &s;aid, may perhaps be able to pay Two Shillings in the Pound, which they, in their blundering Manner, call <HI>Two per Cent;</HI> they mean, that in an Acquittance, the&s;e Words, Five Shillings in full of all Accounts, is as good as Five hundred Pounds, or Five thou&s;and Pounds, in Ballance of all Accompts: &s;uch &s;illy Eva&s;ions require no &s;erious An&s;wer.</P>
<P>Of a Piece with this is their A&s;&s;ertion, That the origi|nal South-Sea Allowance of one twelfth of one per Cent. of their principal Stock, is proportionably four Times as much as two per Cent. per Annum of the Principal of this Bubble. By adducing &s;uch Blunders, they &s;ufficient|ly expo&s;e them&s;elves, without any further Notice of ours.</P>
<P>13thly, <HI>As for the Oppulency of the Signers of the Sil|ver-Money Notes, and of the Signers of the Land-Bank Notes;</HI> they dare venture the I&s;&s;ue of the Ca&s;e upon it. A particular An&s;wer would give room to expo&s;e the mean Circum&s;tances of mo&s;t of the Signers or Directors; but this we chu&s;e to avoid.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude with this Ob&s;ervation, concerning the Cau&s;e of Paper-Money, publick, or private, depreciating from Time to Time. It is a received, but artful Pre|judice, in&s;till'd by de&s;igning Men, into the Minds of the Vulgar; That Merchants, and money'd Men, giving an advanced Price for Silver is the Occa&s;ion of it: If we reflect &s;eriou&s;ly, Can it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the&s;e Men in general would thus depreciate their own out&s;tanding Book-Debts and Bonds, which at all Times are of va&s;tly greater Sums than the Silver they may purcha&s;e from Time to Time: This would al&s;o ri&s;e the Price of all other Returns upon them&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="004800_0016_100DF1A42ABE1BB0">
<HI>Merchants Notes</HI> equal to Silver, at a determined Value, paid away, received, or bonded, they call <HI>U&s;ury.</HI> I am no Friend to private Currencies of any Kind; but upon this Occa&s;ion, mu&s;t remind the Land-Bank A|bettors, that to &s;erve their Cau&s;e, they allow of Incon|&s;i&s;tencies in them&s;elves, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> not long &s;ince they told us, that &s;eeing Specialties, are not forbid in the Law; private People mu&s;t blame them&s;elves, Orphans mu&s;t blame their Guardians, and Widows their Advi&s;ers, if they lo&s;e by Contracts made in depreciating Bills.</P>
<P>Writing upon this Subject, <HI>Sir,</HI> by &s;etting the Affair in a clear Light, may be of &s;ome U&s;e to the proper Per|&s;ons at Home; I wi&s;h it could have the &s;ame good Ef|fect upon the deluded Multitude in this Province who receive it for no other Rea&s;on, but that they can pa&s;s it again. People of clear E&s;tates and who value them&s;elves upon the Character of hone&s;t Men, de&s;pi&s;e and abhor it as a barefaced popular Fraud. In&s;olvent Debtors catch hold of any Thing for a pre&s;ent Reprieve. Some Sol|vents, void of Hone&s;ty readily embrace Bubbles to de|coy and make a Prey of the weak unthinking Multitude, &s;uch will no more hearken to Rea&s;on than an incorrigi|ble Thief will to the eighth Commandment.</P>
