<P>The <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> Gentleman. SIR,
UNder&s;tanding you are come down to repre&s;ent your Town in the approaching Se&s;&s;ion, I heartily <HI>congratulate</HI> you on the &s;ame: And &s;eeing the divine Providence, which Superintends humane Affairs, has allotted you that Service, I hope you will approve your &s;elf <HI>a &s;incere Lover of your Country,</HI> and make it abundantly evident, that <HI>our mo&s;t valuable Intere&s;ts</HI> lay near your Heart.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o my earne&s;t Wi&s;h, that his Ex|cellency, and the whole General A&s;&s;embly may enjoy the Divine Conduct and Di|rection, in all the weighty and Arduous Affairs that may come before them,; and &s;o be (under Heaven) <HI>the happy Instruments of lengthning out our Tranquility.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="002111_0003_0FBB83857934F948">
The <HI>Country</HI> Gentleman. Sir, I mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionately pronounce Amen to your Wi&s;h; and as to my &s;elf, as it has ever been my Ambition, &s;o (I tru&s;t) it &s;hall be my un&s;haken Re&s;olution, in&s;tead of Sacrificing the publick Good, and Ship|wrecking a good Con&s;cience <HI>to gratify a few de&s;igning Men,</HI> to lay out my &s;elf, as I have Ability and Opportunity in the &s;ervice of my dear, native Country. I confe&s;s things look Di&s;couraging, in as much as the Times may ju&s;tly be &s;aid to be <HI>troublous</HI>; in Re|gard of the Divi&s;ions and Animo&s;ities which are among us; but I hope <HI>Good</HI> will come out of <HI>Evil,</HI> and a <HI>Serene Morning</HI> &s;ucceed&punc; a <HI>Stormy Night.</HI></P>
<P><HI>B. Gent.</HI> Your Re&s;olutions are worthy a Man of Honour, and tho&s;e who invincibly ad|here to &s;uch Re&s;olves, do truly <HI>merit Prai&s;e,</HI> the love of which is a Pa&s;&s;ion deeply fixed in the mind of every extraordinary Per&s;on; and tho&s;e who are mo&s;t affected with it, &s;eem mo&s;t to partake of that <HI>divine particle,</HI> which di&s;tingui&s;hes mankind from the inferior Creation. The Stoicks &s;ay, we rea&s;onably owe more to our native Country, than to all other things in this lower World, as &s;he Impales the re&s;t we love and cheri&s;h;

and who &s;tand firm in her pre&s;ervation, &amp; on the contrary mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily peri&s;h with her.</P>
<P>From this generous Affection, &s;o many em|inent Actions have taken Birth, of &s;uch HEROES as have gloriou&s;ly expo&s;ed their Lives for the pre&s;ervation of their Country, and laid a&s;ide their <HI>private Injuries,</HI> for fear of revenging them at the <HI>publick Ex|pence.</HI></P>
<P>Such indeed, challenge a peculiar Reve|rence and Re&s;pect, as they are made In&s;tru|ments of the Con&s;ervation and Protection of Men; and acquire a Univer&s;al Repu|tation, which is the la&s;t degree of happine&s;s <HI>here,</HI> and after they are fallen A&s;leep, it may be &s;aid of them;
<Q><L>'Look thro' yon Azure Vault! what Rays of Light</L>
<L>'Dart from the HEROES glitt'ring Forms! How Bright</L>
<L>'Their Radiant Crowns! &mdash;</L>
<L>'While here their Country's Weal had their Regards,</L>
<L>'Now Heaven be&s;tows munificent Rewards:</L>
<L>'As in the Orb of glorious Deeds they mov'd,</L>
<L>'Superiour Glories crown their Heads above.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="002111_0005_0FBB83897098D778">Thus their Memory, which is <HI>precious,</HI> &s;hall be tran&s;mitted to the late&s;t Po&s;teri|ty, to their Immortal Honour: On the other Hand, with what marks of Infamy do they de&s;erve to be &s;tigmatiz'd, who (tho' Heaven has Liberally furni&s;h'd them with large A|bilities to benefit Mankind) are acted by a <HI>mean, norrow, contracted &s;pirit,</HI> may be ar|gued from what I have &s;aid: (for contra|ries illu&s;trate each other.) This may be called <HI>&s;ordid Frugality</HI> with a witne&s;s; when Men are influenc'd by private views, and on every Occa&s;ion &s;acrifice the <HI>publick</HI> Good to their <HI>particular</HI> Intere&s;ts; mo&s;t certainly the memories of &s;uch &s;hall be accur&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>C. Gent.</HI> What you have &s;aid is agreeable to the Sentiments of Mankind in general; but, Sir, what are we to think of the <HI>Ani|mo&s;ities, Jarrs,</HI> and <HI>Contentions,</HI> that &s;pirit of <HI>Party</HI> and <HI>Faction</HI> prevailing among us; (tho' we have a GOVERNOUR, other Plan|tations would give thou&s;ands of Pounds to enjoy) Doth not <HI>this</HI> look with an ill a&s;pect?</P>
<P><HI>B. Gent.</HI> Truly <HI>this</HI> is matter of Lamen|tation, and will be &s;o to all good men; for the univer&s;al Suffrage of Mankind, and the Oracles of Eternal Truth, do abundantly e|vince,

that a <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> or <HI>City, i. e.</HI> any Com|munity of whatever Denomination, mu&s;t in|evitably fall and come to Ruin, when di|vided again&s;t it &s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>C. Gent.</HI> But what do you a&s;&s;ign as the O|rigin, and Source of our Divi&s;ions; is not the <HI>want of a Medium,</HI> think you, one great Cau&s;e?</P>
<P><HI>B. Gent.</HI> The want of a Medium may, no doubt, be a&s;&s;ign'd as one great cau&s;e of our Calamities; for the Silver and Gold be|ing Ship'd off, and the Paper Bills exhau&s;t|ed; what <HI>Oppre&s;&s;ion, Injustice,</HI> and <HI>cruel U|&s;ury;</HI> what <HI>tricking, cheating, defrauding,</HI> and <HI>overeaching,</HI> like a Deluge, has over|flow'd us? to the grievous Scandal of the Chri&s;tian Name.</P>
<P>Hence it is that the various Schemes, &amp; projections, and Sentiments of Men (as their particular Intere&s;ts, and private views have led them) have been exhibited, and almo&s;t an infinite number of Pamphlets di&s;per&s;ed thro' the Country; to this are owing, the Conte&s;ts and Controver&s;ies among us, which have been managed with &s;uch <HI>furious Zeal,</HI> and <HI>Party warmth,</HI> as has ended in Enmity, and utter Alienation: But to &s;ay no more

of former things; what think you of Mr. <HI>Colman</HI>'s <HI>di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;tate of Bo&s;ton,</HI> with the &s;e|veral An&s;wers; and what Reception do they meet with among you in the Country.</P>
<P><HI>C. Gent.</HI> Altho' the Government &s;aw good very highly to re&s;ent &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in that Treati&s;e, yet I verily believe the Gentleman <HI>was far from de&s;igning any Reflection</HI> on it (as he &s;olemnly declares, pag. 9.) but that the Good and Happine&s;s of the Town and Country were lying near his Heart; and that <HI>mo&s;t</HI> of the things therein contained are mat|ters of Fact, is obvious to every man, who is acquainted with the circum&s;tances of things, which he has &s;et in a <HI>true light,</HI> in the Judgment of all Judicious Men, whom I have convers'd with.</P>
<P>When I perus'd a Pamphlet, containing &s;ome Remarks, &amp;c. on the above mention'd Tract, and ob&s;erved the Author's <HI>circular way of Argumentation</HI>; I &s;uppo&s;ed (being immers'd in more &s;ublime Studies) he might imagine him&s;elf on &s;ome <HI>lofty Topick in Me|taphy&s;icks,</HI> and &s;o has at once been mi&s;taken in his <HI>Theme,</HI> and his Notions of the <HI>true Intere&s;t</HI> of his Country: 'Tis well he owns him&s;elf liable to <HI>mi&s;takes,</HI> for it requires no great Judgment or Penetration, to detect his Ab&s;urdities and Incon&s;i&s;tences; altho' he

boa&s;ts, (pag. 12) that he has <HI>made Things appear as plain and certain as a Mathemati|cal Demon&s;tration</HI>; and challenges <HI>any man to confute him</HI>; but (pag. 19.) he calls the &s;ame things, <HI>matters of doubtful Di&s;putation</HI>: But his wonderful Projection, to force Men (by a fatal Nece&s;&s;ity) to Indu&s;try, Frugality, and Good Husbandry, and &s;o at once to ex|tricate us out of our Difficulties, is, to have <HI>neither Money or Credit:</HI> (Sir, don't you think <HI>Longitude,</HI> and a <HI>Communication between us and the Moon,</HI> will be found out quickly, and be made as plain as a <HI>Demon&s;tration!</HI>) Surely this Projection would &s;oon extricate us out of this <HI>wretched Life,</HI> if the Govern|ment &s;hould fall in with it, <HI>and I am great|ly deceived, if we ever &s;ee good days again:</HI> But I would have our Projector make the Experiment, and try whether it is <HI>practicable</HI> to &s;ub&s;i&s;t any time without <HI>Money</HI> or <HI>Credit</HI>; and if he finds it is, then let him recommend his Project to the Government.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Colman,</HI> (in pag. 2. and 9. of his tract) touches to the <HI>Quick</HI> an Order of Gentlemen (as if a man &s;hould thru&s;t a Firebrand into a Ne&s;t of Hornets) who with &s;hame (or ra|ther in a &s;hamele&s;s manner) Cry, GIVE YE: But it was not long before one of the fierce&s;t of 'em, being rous'd up, (as a &s;trong man af|ter

Wine) and having fill'd his Pandoras Box, and fitted him&s;elf for his Ma&s;ters Ser|vice, &s;its down, to blot with his dete&s;table Scurrility, a Paper calld the <HI>Deadham Post|&s;cript</HI>; in which po&s;ture, were it not ju&s;t to paint him (&s;omething as I've &s;een K. <HI>J</HI>&mdash;) with the Father of Lyes at at his right hand to <HI>instigate</HI> and <HI>dictate,</HI> and an huge Bowl of exhillerating PUNCH at his left to <HI>intoxi|cate.</HI></P>
<P>But (as one &s;ays) can any be &s;o &s;imple as to think, the Cau&s;e he &s;eems to patronize can receive any Benefit by the <HI>Clamour and Railing</HI> of &s;o mean and &s;ordid a Wretch, who&s;e Tongue, as we u&s;e to &s;ay, is no Slan|der? Here he makes a mighty <HI>Stir</HI> (from his tender regards for the honour of Govern|ment) and out of his <HI>high-flying Zeal,</HI> thun|ders out Non-re&s;i&s;tance &amp; Pa&s;&s;ive Obedience, that we <HI>&s;peak not Evil of Dignities, and be &s;ubject to the higher Powers,</HI> in &s;uch ha&s;te, that he jumps over the 2d Chap. of the Epi&s;tle, in which there is an Apo&s;tolical Interrogation, which he would do well to con&s;ider and <HI>apply,</HI> for it is directly leveld as if de&s;igned for <HI>him,</HI> Ver&s;e 23. <HI>Thou that make&s;t thy boast of the Law, thro' breaking the Law di&s;honoure&s;t thou God?</HI> But what has this man to do with the Go&s;pel? Has he
<PB N="9" REF="002111_0010_0FBB83948A7BF1D8">
ever read P&s;al. 50.16, and onward? Or doth <HI>Paul</HI> give a toleration for men to <HI>be drunk,</HI> and in their merry Cups to <HI>thre&s;h their wives,</HI> contrary to the Light and Law of Nature as well as the Go&s;pel? Or is it <HI>Peter</HI>? No: Perhaps 'tis his pretended Succe&s;&s;or at <HI>Rome</HI> gives the <HI>Indulgence,</HI> with promi&s;es of Pardon for all Sins, pa&s;t, pre&s;ent, and to come.</P>
<P><HI>B. Gent.</HI> Sir, What you have &s;aid brings to my mind an in&s;ufferable Affront lately offer'd to the Town of <HI>Boston.</HI> On the 10<HI>th</HI> of <HI>June,</HI> being the Day of our Election of Repre&s;entatives, and the Pretenders Birth Day there came into the publick Town-Meeting, a certain Gentleman, (or rather mercenary R&mdash;l) and having placd him|&s;elf on the Bench, and a&s;&s;um'd an uncommon Air of Impudence, he began <HI>imperiou&s;ly to dictate to his &s;uperiors</HI>; and out of his &s;u|perabundant Loyalty to King GEORGE, and Love to the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion, propos'd, <HI>That all the Inhabitants of the Town (tho' otherwi&s;e qualifi'd according to Law (&s;hould have the Oaths of Allegiance and Abjuration tender'd to them, before they might be a lowed to vote</HI>: And having a&s;&s;erted that there was a Law obliging thereunto (tho' he could not
<PB N="10" REF="002111_0011_0FBB839612B6AA28">
produce the &s;ame) he went on with his talk as pertinently as a Man may be &s;uppos'd to do, if he &s;hould undertake to prove to a demon&s;tration, that <HI>Lawyer and Liar are &s;y|nonimous Terms</HI>; Till Mr. Moderator was forc'd to exert his Authority to &s;till his un|ruly Tongue: This extreamly exa&s;perated the Town, to be challeng'd by &s;uch a d&mdash; D&mdash;, when perhaps there are not 400 more <HI>true,</HI> and <HI>loyal Subjects</HI> (with humble &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to <HI>Lanca&s;hire Jack)</HI> in the Kings Dominions; but 'tis generally &s;uppos'd he came (<HI>as a Tool</HI>) to &s;et the Town together by the Ears, and <HI>hinder</HI> the expected Choice.</P>
<P><HI>C. G.</HI> We are not ignorant in the Country of the confounded <HI>jugling Tricks</HI> that have been acted ju&s;t before the their choice of Repre&s;entatives in the &s;everal Towns, by &s;ending <HI>Emi&s;&s;aries,</HI> and di&s;patching abun|dance of <HI>Letters (with News from Robin&s;on Cru&s;o's I&s;land)</HI> from <HI>Vill</HI> to <HI>Vill,</HI> to amu&s;e the Country; in&s;inuating that if things were carried on as they were the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion, we mu&s;t expect <HI>the &s;ame Fate,</HI> and that the Country will <HI>be ruin'd by the vast Expence and Damage of broken Conventions</HI>; much like the Cry of the High-flying Party in England, in QUEEN ANN's Time, <HI>the Church, the
<PB N="11" REF="002111_0012_0FBB83984533E0F0">
Church</HI> is in Danger! And there has not been wanting their utmo&s;t Efforts, nor any &s;tone left unturned, to compa&s;s their Noble De&s;igns, &amp; make things an&s;wer their De&s;ire, tho' they have been drove to &s;uch Extremity in two Towns (as I am well Inform'd) to bring in two Gentlemen, <HI>(who ate by &s;ome accounted Pillars in the Hou&s;e)</HI> that their <HI>Evangelical Pa&s;tor</HI> in one, and an <HI>ungodly Aethropian</HI> in the other, were <HI>Voters</HI> to make a Majority&punc; and how unprecedented each of the&s;e In&s;tances are, I leave the world to Judge. Probably all this mighty &s;tir has been made, to antedote the <HI>Do&s;e of Hellebore</HI> Mr. <HI>Colman</HI> admini&s;tred to the Country, (pag. 9. of his <HI>Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed State)</HI> where he advi&s;es them to &s;end publick &s;pirited men, to repre|&s;ent them, not Sheriffs and Lawyers, who are the only men, who are benefitted by their Neighbours Straits, and fill their Cof|fers out of the Ruins of their E&s;tates; but <HI>&s;i populus 'vult decipi, decipiatur.</HI></P>
<P><HI>B. G.</HI> It is too well known what &s;ly In&s;inuations have been u&s;ed by a Set of Ra&s;h men in Bo&s;ton (before the coming together of the Convention, under the Hypocritical Di&s;gui&s;e of contending for Perogatives) with the Country Gentlemen, to Induce 'em to fall into &s;uch Mea&s;ures, as may endanger the Lo&s;s of a Charter, <HI>full of Singular Privilidges</HI> (which would be very grateful to &s;everal Gentlemen, who&s;e Names I forbear to mention) and involve us in &s;uch mi&s;erable Circum&s;tances, <HI>as a little valiant talk over a Bowl of Punch cannot extricate out of.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="002111_0013_0FBB839A0BA06120"><HI>C. G.</HI> I had not been half an hour in Town before I was &s;aluted by a very corpulent Gentleman of the 'Change, who thru&s;t into my hand a Pamphlet, which he told me was a <HI>Word in Sea&s;on,</HI> and contained Mat|ters of great Importance; and was very importunate with me, to give it a &s;peedy Peru&s;al: The Title of it was, <HI>News from Robin&s;on Cru&s;o's I&s;land</HI>; and I &s;oon found it contained &s;undry &s;candalous Reflections of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives. That on purpo&s;e to &s;how their &s;pite to the G&mdash;&mdash;n, they had put a publick Affront on him, and were guilty of the highe&s;t and mo&s;t <HI>&s;ordid Ingratitude</HI>; That they were <HI>Punch Bib|bers,</HI> and <HI>Enemies of their Country,</HI> and bringing on it <HI>the la&s;t Degree of Slavery:</HI> And on the whole, I was far from being of our celebrated News-mongers mind, that it was proper <HI>to be communicated,</HI> and <HI>worth Peoples knowing.</HI></P>
<P><HI>B. G.</HI> Whoever was the Author of that &s;canda|lous Pamphlet, 'tis generally and on good grounds &s;up|po&s;ed to be one, who&s;e <HI>Scribendi Cacoethes</HI> has made him famous on both &s;ides the <HI>Atlantick,</HI> who&s;e Brain is overcharged with &s;o great a variety of News, that the Country feels them&s;elves on many accounts the <HI>wor&s;e for him.</HI> The main Spring of his Learned Jar|gon &s;eems to be, to fright the Country out of their Privileges, le&s;t while they lawfully u&s;e them, <HI>they &s;pit in the Face of Government</HI>: And having run his Parallel to a very great Length, anon he begins to utter <HI>grievous Menaces,</HI> and to roar and bellow like the Popes Bull, that we have by a <HI>Train of bad U&s;ages</HI> compelled a good Spirited Governour to &s;uch an in|flexible Re&s;olution, that <HI>he will make us know he is our Governour</HI>: But with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his <HI>Holine&s;s,</HI> we <HI>do know</HI> he is our Governour, (and <HI>as &s;uch,</HI> wou'd have all due Regards paid him; But what then? Mu&s;t we therefore <HI>tamely and quietly</HI> give up all
<PB N="13" REF="002111_0014_0FBB839D386BE8A0">
our <HI>Rights and Priviledges</HI>; and &s;o render our &s;elves obnoxious to the Cur&s;e of &s;ucceeding Generations?</P>
<P><HI>C. G.</HI> No verily: for if we tamely give up one Inch, we &s;hall (according to the Proverb) find by &s;ad Experience, we &s;hall lo&s;e an Ell; and anon (like the Giants after the Flood) nothing will be re&s;trained them of all that they have imagined; And who knows where their De&s;igns and De&s;ires will terminate.</P>
<P><HI>B. G.</HI> But the great Controver&s;y of late, has been touching the <HI>A&s;&s;emblies Right of chu&s;ing a Speaker</HI>; and <HI>the Governour's Power to Negative their Choice</HI>; which Matter has been &s;et in a true Light by an honourable Gentleman, in his ju&s;t and &s;ea&s;onable Vin|dication, wherein he has fully made it appear, <HI>That the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives have an unque&s;tionable, fun|damental Right, to choo&s;e their Speaker; and that the Governour has no Negative Voice in that Election</HI>; and that the giving up of this Point, which is of &s;o great Concern and Importance, would give a deadly wound to the Con&s;titution: And altho' that Gentlemans Name has been greatly Canvas'd by a few, who&s;e Endeavours have been u&s;ed to ca&s;t an Odium upon it; (yet if it be a true Maxim that Intere&s;t will not lie) he is one who has approved him&s;elf a true Friend to his Country, a loyal Subject to King GEORGE. One who will never be guilty of <HI>li&s;tening to a few de&s;igning Men,</HI> nor be im|po&s;ed upon by <HI>popular and plau&s;ible In&s;inuations.</HI></P>
<P><HI>C. G.</HI> The Choice of a Speaker is one of the valu|able Priviledges this Province Enjoys, and of which, 'tis &s;trange there &s;hould be any Endeavours to deprive them.</P>
<P>I hope this A&s;&s;embly will intirely fall in with the Sen|timents of the la&s;t, and that private differences, will no more have any influence on the Publick Affairs; (which is highly unrea&s;onable, by how much the Publick Good, ought to be preferred to particular men's Intere&s;ts) and in a word, may this Province ever
<PB N="14" REF="002111_0015_0FBB839E3807EEE0">
have an A&s;&s;embly that will <HI>quit them&s;elves like Men,</HI> in &s;tanding up for the <HI>just Rights</HI> and <HI>Priviledges</HI> of their Country: May we ever enjoy a <HI>ju&s;t</HI> and <HI>wi&s;e</HI> Government, that will a&s;&s;ert and maintain the <HI>Preroga|tives</HI> of the Crown, and being extricated out of the Difficulties we labour under, may we again &s;ee <HI>happy and glorious Days,</HI> and the Council of all &s;uch as would &s;trike at our Con&s;titution be turned into fooli&s;hne&s;s; to which, every good man will &s;ay AMEN.</P>
<P>Before we part, Sir, I beg the Favour that you would read to me a certain Letter, which you told me formerly, you had by you.</P>
