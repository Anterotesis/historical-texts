<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<P>I ARRIVED at Paris, by a very rapid journey, the day before the federation; and when I am di&s;po&s;ed to murmur at the evils of my de&s;tiny, I &s;hall henceforth put this piece of good fortune into the oppo&s;ite &s;cale, and re|flect how many di&s;appointments it ought to counterbalance. Had the packet which con|veyed me from Brighton to Dieppe &s;ailed a few hours later; had the wind been contrary; in &s;hort, had I not reached Paris at the mo|ment I did reach it, I &s;hould have mi&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t &s;ublime &s;pectacle which, perhaps, was ever repre&s;ented on the theatre of this earth.</P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;end you once a week the details which I promi&s;ed when we parted, though I am well aware how very imperfectly I &s;hall be able to de&s;cribe the images which pre&s;s upon my mind. It is much ea&s;ier to feel what is
<PB N="4" REF="024003_0004_0FC2E0CF2DD9A3F0">
&s;ublime than to paint it; and all I &s;hall be able to give you will be a faint &s;ketch, to which your own imagination mu&s;t add colour|ing and &s;pirit. The night before the federa|tion, by way of prelude to the &s;olemnities of that memorable day, the Te Deum was per|formed at the church of Notre Dame, by a greater number of mu&s;icians than have ever been a&s;&s;embled together, excepting at We&s;t|min&s;ter Abbey. The overture which prece|ded the Te Deum was &s;imple and maje&s;tic: the mu&s;ic, highly expre&s;&s;ive, had the power of electrifying the hearers: and near the conclu|&s;ion of the piece, the compo&s;or, by artful di&s;|cords, produced a melancholy emotion, and then by exciting ideas of trouble and inquie|tude, prepared the mind for a recitative which affected the audience in a very powerful man|ner, by recalling the images of that con&s;terna|tion and horror which prevailed in Paris on the 13th of July, 1789, the day before that on which the Ba&s;tile was taken. The words were, as well as I can recollect, what follows; &mdash;"People, your enemies advance, with ho&s;tile &s;entiments, with menacing looks! They come to bathe their hands in your blood! Already they encompa&s;s the walls of your City! Ri&s;e, ri&s;e from the inaction in which you are plung|ed, &s;eize your arms, and fly to the combat! God will combat with you!" The&s;e words were &s;ucceeded by a chorus of in&s;truments and voices, deep and &s;olemn, which &s;eemed to
<PB N="5" REF="024003_0005_0FC2E0D096F98010">
chill the &s;oul. But what completed the effect was, when the &s;ound of a loud and heavy bell mixed it&s;elf with this awful concert, in imita|tion of the alarm-bell, which, the day before the taking of the Ba&s;tile, was rung in every church and convent in Paris, and which, it is &s;aid, produced a confu&s;ion of &s;ounds inex|pre&s;&s;ibly horrible. At this moment the audi|ence appeared to breathe with difficulty, every heart &s;eemed frozen with terror; till at length the bell cea&s;ed, the mu&s;ic changed its tone, and another recitative announced the entire de|feat of the enemy; and the whole terminated, after a flouri&s;h of drums and trumpets, with an hymn of thank&s;giving to the Supreme Being.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<P>I PROMISED to &s;end you a de&s;crip|tion of the federation; but it is not to be de|&s;cribed! One mu&s;t have been pre&s;ent, to form any judgment of a &s;cene, the &s;ublimity of which depended much le&s;s on its external magnifi|cence, than on the effect it produced on the minds of the &s;pectators. "The people, &s;ure, the people were the &s;ight!" I may tell you of pavilions, of triumphal arches, of altars on which incen&s;e was burnt, of two hundred thou&s;and men walking in proce&s;&s;ion; but how am I to give you an adequate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lea of the be|haviour
<PB N="6" REF="024003_0006_0FC2E0DF42184140">
of the &s;pectators? How am I to paint the impetuous feelings of that immen&s;e, that exulting multitude? Half a million of people a&s;&s;embled at a &s;pectacle, which furni&s;h|ed every image that can elevate the mind of man; which connected the enthu&s;ia&s;m of mor|al &s;entiment with the &s;olemn pomp of re|ligious ceremonies; which addre&s;&s;ed it&s;elf at once to the imagination, the under&s;tanding, and the heart!</P>
<P>The Champ de Mars was formed into an immen&s;e amphitheatre, round which were erected forty rows of &s;eats, rai&s;ed one above another with earth, on which wooden forms were placed. Twenty days labour, animated by the enthu&s;ia&s;m of the people, accompli&s;hed what &s;eemed to require the toil of years. Al|ready in the Champ de Mars the di&s;tinctions of rank were forgotten; and, in&s;pired by the &s;ame &s;pirit, the highe&s;t and lowe&s;t orders of citizens gloried in taking up the &s;pade, and a&s;|&s;i&s;ting the per&s;ons employed in a work on which the common welfare of the &s;tate de|pended. Ladies took the in&s;truments of la|bour in their hands, and removed a little of the earth, that they might be able to boa&s;t that they al&s;o had a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the preparations at the Champ de Mars; and a number of old &s;old|iers were &s;een voluntarily be&s;towing on their country the la&s;t remains of their &s;trength. A young Abb&eacute; of my acquaintance told me, that the people beat a drum at the door of the con|vent
<PB N="7" REF="024003_0007_0FC2E0E1386A0C10">
where he lived, and obliged the Superior to let all the Monks come out and work in the Champ de Mars. The Superior with great reluctance acquie&s;ced, "Quant &agrave; moi," &s;aid the young Abb&eacute;, "je ne demandois pas mieux."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As for me, I de&s;ired nothing better.</NOTE></P>
<P>At the upper end of the amphitheatre a pa|vilion was built for the reception of the King, the Queen, their attendants, and the National A&s;&s;embly, covered with &s;triped tent-cloth of the national colours, and decorated with &s;treamers of the &s;ame beloved tints, and fleur de lys. The white flag was di&s;played above the &s;pot where the King was &s;eated. In the middle of the Champ de Mars, L'Autel de la Patrie was placed, on which incen&s;e was burnt by prie&s;ts dre&s;&s;ed in long white robes, with &s;a&s;hes of national ribbon. Several in|&s;criptions were written on the altar, but the words vi&s;ible at the greate&s;t di&s;tance were, La Nation, la Loi, et le Roi.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The nation, the Law, and the King.</NOTE></P>
<P>At the lower end of the amphitheatre, op|po&s;ite to the pavilion, three triumphal arches were erected, adorned with emblems and alle|gorical figures.</P>
<P>The proce&s;&s;ion marched to the Champ de Mars, through the central &s;treets of Paris. At La Place de Louis Quinze, the e&s;corts, who carried the colours, received under their ban|ners, ranged in two lines, the National A&s;&s;em|bly, who came from the Thuilleries. When
<PB N="8" REF="024003_0008_0FC2E0E2A61D3B90">
the proce&s;&s;ion pa&s;&s;ed the &s;treet where Henry the Fourth was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated, every man pau&s;ed as if by general con&s;ent: The cries of joy were &s;u&s;pended, and &s;ucceeded by a &s;olemn &s;i|lence. This tribute of regret, paid from the &s;udden impul&s;e of feeling at &s;uch a moment, was perhaps the mo&s;t honourable te&s;timony to the virtues of that amiable Prince, which his memory has yet received.</P>
<P>In the &s;treets, at the windows, and on the roofs of the hou&s;es, the people, tran&s;ported with joy, &s;houted and wept as the proce&s;&s;ion pa&s;&s;ed. Old men were &s;een kneeling in the &s;treets, ble&s;&s;ing God that they had lived to witne&s;s that happy moment. The people ran to the doors of their hou&s;es loaded with re|fre&s;hments, which they offered to the troops; and crowds of women &s;urrounded the &s;oldiers, and holding up their infants in their arms, and melting into tears, promi&s;ed to make their children imbibe, from their earlie&s;t age, an in|violable attachment to the principles of the new con&s;titution.</P>
<P>I recollected the&s;e lines of Shake&s;peare:
<Q><L>He that outlives this day, and comes &s;afe home.</L>
<L>Will &s;tand a tip-toe when this day is nam'd,</L>
<L>And rouze him at the name&mdash;</L>
<L>He that &s;hall live this day, and &s;ee old age,</L>
<L>Will yearly on the vigil fea&s;t his neighbours&mdash;</L>
<L>This &s;tory &s;hall the good man teach his &s;on:</L>
<L>And this day to the ending of the world,</L>
<L>And we in it. &s;hall be remember'd;</L>
<L>We few, we happy few, we band of <HI>brothers</HI></L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="024003_0009_0FC2E0E42B458F78">The proce&s;&s;ion entered the Champ de Mars by a long road, which thou&s;ands of people had a&s;&s;i&s;ted in forming, by filling up deep hollows, levelling the ri&s;ing grounds, and erecting a tem|porary bridge acro&s;s the Seine, oppo&s;ite to the triumphal arches. The order of the proce&s;&s;ion was as follows:

</LIST></P>
<P>The proce&s;&s;ion which was formed with eight per&s;ons abrea&s;t, entered the Champ de Mars beneath the triumphal arches, with a di&s;charge of cannon. The deputies placed them&s;elves round the in&s;ide of the amphitheatre. Between them and the &s;eats of the &s;pectators, the national guard of Paris were ranged; and the &s;eats round the amphitheatre were filled with four hundred thou&s;and people. The mid|dle of the amphitheatre was crowded with an immen&s;e multitude of &s;oldiers. The National A&s;&s;embly walked towards the pavilion, where they placed them&s;elves with the King, the Queen, the royal family, and their attendants; and oppo&s;ite this group, ro&s;e in per&s;pective the hills of Pa&s;&s;y and Chaillot, covered with peo|ple. The &s;tandards, of which one was pre|&s;ented to each department of the kingdom, as a mark of brotherhood, by the citizens of Paris, were carried to the altar to be con&s;ecrated by the bi&s;hop. High ma&s;s was performed, after which Mon&s;ieur de la Fayette, who had been appointed by the King Major General of the Federation, a&s;cended the altar, gave the &s;ignal, and him&s;elf took the national oath. In an in|&s;tant every &s;word was drawn, and every arm
<PB N="11" REF="024003_0011_0FC2E0F6AD8C3B88">
lifted up. The King pronounced the oath, which the Pre&s;ident of the National A&s;&s;embly repeated, and the &s;olemn words were reechoed by &s;ix hundred thou&s;and voices; while the Queen rai&s;ed the Dauphin in her, arms, &s;hew|ing him to the people and the army. At the moment the con&s;ecrated banners were di&s;play|ed, the &s;un, which had been ob&s;cured by fre|quent &s;howers in the cour&s;e of the morning, bur&s;t forth, while the people lifted their eyes to heaven, and called upon the Deity to look down and witne&s;s the &s;acred engagement into which they entered. A re&s;pectful &s;ilence was &s;ucceeded by the cries, the &s;houts, the acclama|tions of the multitude; they wept, they em|braced each other, and then di&s;per&s;ed.</P>
<P>You will not &s;u&s;pect that I was an indiffer|ent witne&s;s of &s;uch a &s;cene. Oh no! this was not a time in which the di&s;tinctions of coun|try were remembered. It was the triumph of human kind; it was man a&s;&s;erting the noble&s;t privileges of his nature; and it required but the common feelings of humanity to become in that moment a citizen of the world. For my&s;elf, I acknowledge that my heart caught with enthu&s;ia&s;m the general &s;ympathy; my eyes were filled with tears; and I &s;hall never forget the &s;en&s;ations of that day, "while mem|ory holds her &s;eat in my bo&s;om."</P>
<P>The weather proved very unfavorable dur|ring the morning of the fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eration; but the minds of people were too much elevated by
<PB N="12" REF="024003_0012_0FC2E0F79EC70F10">
ideas of moral good, to attend to the phy&s;ical evils of the day. Several heavy &s;howers were far from interrupting the general gaiety. The people, when drenched by the rain, call|ed out with exultation, rather than regret, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We are wet for the nation.</NOTE> "Nous &s;ommes mouillez a la nation." Some exclaimed, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The French Revolution is cemented with water in&s;tead of blood.</NOTE> "La revolution Fran&ccedil;oi&s;e e&s;t cimentee avec de l'eau, au lieu do &s;ang." The national guard, during the hours which preceded the arrival of the proce&s;|&s;ion, amu&s;ed the &s;pectators with dancing in a circle, and with a thou&s;and whim&s;ical and play|ful evolutions, highly expre&s;&s;ive of that gaiety which di&s;tingui&s;hes the French character. I believe none but Frenchmen would have di|verted them&s;elves, and half a million of people, who were waiting in expectation of a &s;cene the mo&s;t &s;olemn upon record, by circles of ten thou&s;and men galloping in the round dance. But if you are di&s;po&s;ed to think of this gaiety with the contempt of &s;uperior gravity, for I will not call it wi&s;dom, recollect that the&s;e dancers were the very men who&s;e bravery formed the great epocha of French liberty; the heroes who demoli&s;hed the towers of the Ba&s;|tile, and who&s;e fame will de&s;cend to the late&s;t po&s;terity.</P>
<P>Such was the admirable order with which this augu&s;t &s;pectacle was conducted, that no ac|cident
<PB N="13" REF="024003_0013_0FC2E0F9445E4940">
interrupted the univer&s;al fe&s;tivity. All carriages were forbidden during that day, and the entrances to the Champ de Mass were &s;o numerous, that half a million of people were collected tog<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ther without a crowd.</P>
<P>The people had only one &s;ubject of regret; they murmured that the King had taken the national oath in the pavilion, in&s;tead of per|forming that ceremony at the foot of the altar; and &s;ome of them, crowding round Mon&s;. de la Fayette, conjured him to per&s;uade the King to go to the altar and take the oath a &s;econd time. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">My friends, the each is not an air which can be played twice over.</NOTE>"Mes enfans," &s;aid Mon&s;. de la Fayette, "le ferment n'e&s;t pas une ariette, on ne peut pas le jouer deux fois."</P>
<P>Mon&s;. de la Fayette, after the Federation, went to the Chateau de la Muette, where a public dinner was prepared for the national guard. An immen&s;e crowd gathered round him when he alighted from his hor&s;e, at a little di&s;tance from the chateau; and &s;ome Ari&s;tocrates, mix|ing them&s;elves with the true wor&s;hippers of him who is &s;o ju&s;tly the idol of the French na|tion, attempted to &s;tifle him with their embra|ces. He called out <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">But, my friends, you &s;tifle me.</NOTE> "<HI>Mais, mes amis, vous m'e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">auffex!</HI>" and one of his <HI>aide de camps,</HI> who perceived the danger of his general, threw him&s;elf from his hor&s;e, which he intreated
<PB N="14" REF="024003_0014_0FC2E1025A4098A8">
Mon&s;. de la Fayette to mount. He did &s;o, and ha&s;tened to the chateau.</P>
<P>This incident reminds me of a line in Ra|cine's fine tragedy of Britanicus, where Nero &s;ays,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I embrace my rival, but it is to de&s;troy him.</NOTE>'J'embra&s;&s;e mon rival, mais e'e&s;t pour l'etouffer.'</P>

<HEAD>LETTER III.</HEAD>
<P>THE rejoicings at Paris did not termi|nate with the ceremony of the Federation: A &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of entertainments, which la&s;ted &s;ev|eral days, were prepared for the deputies from the provinces, who were all quartered in the hou&s;es of the bourgeois, where they were re|ceived with the mo&s;t cordial ho&s;pitality.</P>
<P>The night of the 14th of July, the whole city of Paris was illuminated, and the next day le ci-devant Duc, now Mon&s;. d'Orleans, gave a public dinner to the national guard in the hall of the Palais Royal. We walked in the even|ing round the gallery, from which we &s;aw part of the crowd below amu&s;ing them&s;elves by dancing, while others were &s;inging in chorus the favourite national &s;ongs.</P>
<P>On the following Sunday the national guards were reviewed by Mon&s;. de la Fayette in the
<PB N="15" REF="024003_0015_0FC2E1051F968088">
Champ de Mars, which was again filled with &s;pectators, and the people appeared more en|thu&s;ia&s;tic than ever in their applau&s;es of their General. The Champ de Mars re&s;ounded with repeated cries of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Long live Mon&s;. de la Fayette.</NOTE> "Vive Mon&s;. de la Fayette." On this day carriages were again forbidden, and the evening di&s;played a &s;cene of general rejoicing. The whole city was il|luminated, and crowds of company filled the gardens of the Thuilleries, from which we &s;aw the beautiful fa&ccedil;ade of the Louvre lighted in the mo&s;t &s;plendid manner. In the Champ Ely&s;&eacute;es, where a fete was given to the Depu|ties, innumerable lamps were hung from one row of trees to another and &s;hed the mo&s;t agree|able brilliance on tho&s;e enchanting walks; where the exhilarated crowd danced and &s;ung; and filled the air with the &s;ound of rejoicing. Several parties of the national guard came from the Champs Ely&s;&eacute;es, dancing along the walks of the Thuilleries with a woman between every two men; and all the prie&s;ts, whom they met in their way, they obliged to join in the dance, treating them as women, by placing them be|tween two &s;oldiers, and &s;ometimes &s;portively dre&s;&s;ing them in grenadiers caps. Fire-works of great variety and beauty were exhibited on the Pont Neuf, and the &s;tatue of Henry the fourth was decorated with the ornament of all others the mo&s;t dear in the eyes of the people, a &s;carf of national ribbon. Tran&s;parencies of
<PB N="16" REF="024003_0016_0FC2E10C41E682E0">
Mon&s;. de la Fayette and Mon&s;. Bailly were placed, as the highe&s;t mark of public favour, on each &s;ide of this revered &s;tatue.</P>
<P>But the &s;pectacle of all others the mo&s;t in|tere&s;ting to my feelings, was the rejoicings at the Ba&s;tile. The ruins of that execrable fort|re&s;s were &s;uddenly transformed, as if with the wand of necromancy, into a &s;cene of beauty and of plea&s;ure. The ground was covered with fre&s;h clods of gra&s;s, upon which young trees were placed in rows, and illuminated with a blaze of light. Here the minds of the people took a higher tone of exultation than in the other &s;cenes of fe&s;tivity. Their mutual congratulations, their reflections on the horror of the pa&s;t, their &s;en&s;e of pre&s;ent felicity, their cries of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Long live the Nation.</NOTE> "Vive la Nation," &s;till ring in my ear! I too, though but a &s;ojourner in their land, rejoiced in their happine&s;s, joined the univer|&s;al voice, and repeated with all my heart and &s;oul, "Vive la Nation!"</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IV.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE I &s;uffered my friends at Paris to conduct me through the u&s;ual routine of convents, churches, and palaces, I reque&s;ted to vi&s;it the Ba&s;tile; feeling a much

&s;tronger de&s;ire to contemplate the ruins of that building than the mo&s;t perfect edifices of Par|is. When we got into the carriage, our French &s;ervant called to the coachman, with an air of triumph, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To the Ba&s;tile&mdash;but we &s;hall not remain there.</NOTE> "A la Ba&s;tile&mdash;mais nous n'y re&s;terons pas." We drove under that porch which &s;o many wretches have en|tered never to repa&s;s, and alighting from the carriage, de&s;cended with difficulty into the dungeons, which were too low to admit of our &s;tanding upright, and &s;o dark that we were obliged at noon-day to vi&s;it them with the light of a candle.

the hard heart of tyranny it&s;elf would contrive; for, &s;ince the de&s;truction of the building, many &s;ubterraneous cells have been di&s;covered under|neath a piece of ground which was inclo&s;ed within the walls of the Ba&s;tile, but which &s;eem|ed a bank of &s;olid earth before the horrid &s;e|crets of this pri&s;on-hou&s;e were di&s;clo&s;ed.

<P>After having vi&s;ited the Ba&s;tile, we may indeed be &s;urpri&s;ed, that a nation &s;o enlighten|ed as the French, &s;ubmitted &s;o long to the op|pre&s;&s;ions of their government; but we mu&s;t cea&s;e to wonder that their indignant &s;pirits at length &s;hook off the galling yoke.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have contemplated the dungeons of the Ba&s;tile, without rejoicing in the French revolution, may&punc; for aught I know, be very re&s;pectable per&s;ons, and very agreeable com+panions in the hours of pro&s;perity; but, if my heart were &s;inking with angui&s;h, I &s;hould not fly to tho&s;e per&s;ons for con&s;olation.

<P>The Ba&s;tile, which Henry the Fourth and his veteran troops a&s;&s;ailed in vain, the citizens of Paris had the glory of taking in a few hours, The avarice of Mon&s;. de Launay had tempted him to guard this fortre&s;s with only half the complement of men ordered by government; and a letter which he received the morning of the 14th of July, commanding him to &s;u&s;tain the &s;iege till the evening, when &s;uccour would arrive, joined to his own treachery towards the a&s;&s;ailants, co&s;t him his life.</P>
<P>The courage of the be&s;iegers was inflamed by the horrors of famine, there being at this time only twenty-four hours provi&s;ion of bread in Paris. For &s;ome days the people had a&s;|&s;embled in crowds round the &s;hops of the bak|ers, who were obliged to have a guard of &s;old|iers to protect them from the fami&s;hed multi|tude; while the women, rendered furious by

want, cried, in the re&s;olute tone of de&s;pair,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We mu&s;t have bread for our children.</NOTE> "Il nous faut du pain pour nos enfans." Such was the &s;carcity of bread, that a French gen|tleman told me, that, the day preceding the taking of the Ba&s;tile, he was invited to dine with a Negotiant, and, when he went, was in|formed that a &s;ervant had been out five hours in &s;earch of bread, and had at la&s;t been able to purcha&s;e only one loaf.</P>
<P>It was at this cri&s;is, it was to &s;ave them&s;elves the &s;hocking &s;pectacle of their wives and in|fants peri&s;hing before their eyes, that the citi|zens of Paris &s;lew to arms, and, impelled <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> by &s;uch cau&s;es, fought with the daring intre|pidity of men who had all that renders life of any value as &s;take, and who determined to die or conquer. The women too, far from in|dulging the fears incident to our feeble &s;ex, in defiance of the cannon of the Ba&s;tile, ventured to bring victuals to their &s;ons and hu&s;bands; and, with a &s;pirit worthy of Roman matrons, encouraged them to go on. Women mounted guard in the &s;treets, and, when any per&s;on pa&s;&s;|ed, call out, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Who goes there?</NOTE> "Qui va la?"</P>
<P>A gentleman, who had the command of fifty men in this enterpri&s;e, told me, that one of his &s;oldiers being killed by a cannon ball, the peo|ple, with great marks of indignation, removed the corps, and then, &s;natching up the dead man's hat, begged money of the by&s;tanders for

<P>When the Ba&s;tile was taken, and the old man, of whom you have no doubt heard, and who had been confined in a dungeon thirty-|five years, was brought into day-light, which had not for &s;o long a &s;pace of time vi&s;ited his eyes, he &s;taggered, &s;hook his white beard, and cried faintly. <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gentlemen, you have rendered me one great &s;ervice: render me another, kill me! for I know not where to go.

the doors of their hou&s;es loaded with wine, brandy, and other refre&s;hments, which they offered to the&s;e deliverers of their country. But they refu&s;ed to ta&s;te any &s;trong liquors, con&s;idering the great work they had undertaken as not yet accompli&s;hed, and being determined to watch the whole night, in ca&s;e of any &s;ur|pri&s;e.</P>
<P>All tho&s;e who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted in taking the Ba&s;|tile, were pre&s;ented by the municipality of Par|is with a ribbon of the national colours, on which is &s;tamped, inclo&s;ed in a circle of bra&s;s, an impre&s;&s;ion of the ba&s;tile, and which &s;o worn as a military order.</P>
<P>The municipality of Paris al&s;o propo&s;ed a &s;olemn funeral proce&s;&s;ion, in memory of tho&s;e who lo&s;t their lives in this enterpri&s;e; but, on making application to the National A&s;&s;embly for a deputation of its members to a&s;&s;i&s;t at this &s;olemnity, the A&s;&s;embly were of opinion that the&s;e funeral honours &s;hould be po&s;tponed till a more favorable moment&punc; as they might at pre&s;ent have a tendency to inflame the minds of the people.</P>
<P>I have heard &s;everal per&s;ons mention a young man, of a little in&s;ignificant figure, who, the day before the Ba&s;tile was taken, got up on a chair in the Palais Royal, and harangued the multitude, conjuring them to make a &s;truggle for their liberty, and a&s;&s;erting that now the mo|ment was arrived.

when he had in&s;tructed as many as could hear him at on time, he reque&s;ted them to depart, and repeated his harangue to a new &s;et of au|ditors.</P>
<P>Among the dungeons of the Ba&s;tile are plac|ed, upon a heap of &s;tones, the figures of the two men who contrived the plan of this fortre&s;s, where they were afterwards confined for life. The&s;e men are repre&s;ented chained to the wall, and are beheld without any emotion of &s;ympa|thy.</P>
<P>The per&s;on employed to remove the ruins of the Ba&s;tile, has framed of the &s;tones, eighty-three complete models of this building, which, with a true patriotic &s;pirit, he has pre&s;ented to the eighty-three departments of the kingdom, by way of hint to his countrymen to take care of their liberties in future.</P>

<P>I AM ju&s;t returned from a vi&s;it to Mad|ame Sillery, who&s;e works on education are &s;o well known, and &s;o ju&s;tly e&s;teemed in Eng|land, and who received me with the mo&s;t en|gaging politene&s;s. Surely the French are un|rivalled in the arts of plea&s;ing; in the power of uniting with the mo&s;t poli&s;hed elegance of manners, that attentive kindne&s;s which &s;eems
<PB N="24" REF="024003_0024_0FC2E126DCB6A1B8">
to flow warm from the heart, and which, while it &s;ooths our vanity, &s;ecures our affections. Madame Sillery and her pupils are at pre&s;ent at St. Leu, a beautiful &s;pot in the rich valley of Montmo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">enci. Mon&s;. d'Orleans has cer|tainly conferred a mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential obligation up|on his children, by placing them under the care of this lady. I never met with young people more amiable in their di&s;po&s;itions, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> more charming in their manners, which are equally remote from arrogance, and from tho&s;e efforts of conde&s;cen&s;ion which I have &s;een &s;ome great people make, with much difficulty to them&s;elves, and much offence to others. The Prince&s;s, who is thirteen years of age, has a countenance of the &s;weete&s;t expre&s;&s;ion, and appears to me to be Adelaide, the heroine of Madame Sillery's Letters on Education, per|&s;onified. The three princes, though under Madame Sillery's &s;uperintendence, have al&s;o preceptors who live in the hou&s;e, and a&s;&s;i&s;t in their education. The elde&s;t prince, Mon&s;. de Chartres, is nearly eighteen years of age, and his attentive politene&s;s formed a &s;triking con|tra&s;t in my mind, to the manners of tho&s;e fa&s;h|ionable gentlemen in a certain great metropo|lis, who con&s;ider apathy and negligence as the te&s;t of good breeding. But if I was plea&s;ed with the manners of this young Prince, I was &s;till more delighted to find him a confirmed friend to the new con&s;titution of France, and willing, with the enthu&s;ia&s;m of a young and
<PB N="25" REF="024003_0025_0FC2E13E438A95F0">
ardent mind, to renounce the &s;plendor of his titles for the general good. When he heard that the &s;acrifice of fortune al&s;o was required, and that the immen&s;e property, which he had been taught to con&s;ider as his inheritance, was to be divided with his brothers, he embraced them with the utmo&s;t affection, declaring that he &s;hould rejoice in &s;uch a divi&s;ion. To find a democratic Prince, was &s;omewhat &s;ingular: I was much le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ed that Madame Sillery had adopted &s;entiments which are &s;o conge|nial to an enlarged and comprehen&s;ive mind. This lady I have called Sillery, becau&s;e it is the name by which &s;he is known in England; but, &s;ince the decree of the National A&s;&s;em|bly, aboli&s;hing the nobility, &s;he has renounced with her title the name of Sillery, and has tak|en that of Brulart.</P>
<P>She talked to me of the di&s;tinctions of rank, in the &s;pirit of philo&s;ophy, and ridiculed the ab&s;urdity of converting the rewards of per&s;on|al merit into the inheritance of tho&s;e who had perhaps &s;o little claim to honours, that they were a &s;ort of oblique reproach on their char|acter and conduct. There may be arguments again&s;t hereditary rank &s;ufficiently convincing to &s;uch an under&s;tanding as Madame Brulart's; but I know &s;ome French ladies who entertain very different notions on this &s;ubject; who &s;ee no impropriety in the e&s;tabli&s;hments of no|bility; and who have carried their love of ar|i&s;tocratical rights &s;o far as to keep their bed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc;
<PB N="26" REF="024003_0026_0FC2E13FA73571F0">
in a fit of de&s;pondency, upon being obliged to relinqui&s;h the agreeable epithets of Comte&s;&s;e or Marqui&s;e, to which their ears had been &s;o long accu&s;tomed.</P>
<P>But let me do ju&s;tice to the ladies of France. The number of tho&s;e who have murmured at the lo&s;s of rank, bears a very &s;mall proportion to tho&s;e who have acted with a &s;pirit of di&s;tin|gui&s;hed patrioti&s;m; who, with tho&s;e generous affections which belong to the female heart, have gloried in &s;acrificing titles, fortune, and even the per&s;onal ornaments, &s;o dear to female vanity, for the common cau&s;e. It was the la|dies who gave the example of le don patriot|ique,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The patriotic donation.</NOTE> by offering their jewels at the &s;hrine of liberty; and, if the women of ancient Rome have gained the applau&s;e of di&s;tant ages for &s;uch actions, the women of France will al&s;o claim the admiration of po&s;terity.</P>
<P>The women have certainly had a con&s;idera|ble &s;hare in the French revolution; for, what|ever the imperious lords of the creation may fancy, the mo&s;t important events which take place in this world, depend a little on our in|fluence; and we often act in human affairs like tho&s;e &s;ecret &s;prings in mechani&s;m, by which, though invi&s;ible, great movements are regulated.</P>
<P>But let us return to Madame Brulart, who wears at her brea&s;t a medallion made of a &s;tone of the Ba&s;tile, poli&s;hed. In the middle of
<PB N="27" REF="024003_0027_0FC2E1410E6253C8">
the medallion, <HI>Libert&eacute;</HI> was written in diamonds; above was marked, in diamonds, the planet that &s;hone on the 14th of July; and below was &s;een the moon, of the &s;hape &s;he appeared that memorable night. The medallion was &s;et in a branch of laurel, compo&s;ed of emeralds, and tied at the top with the national cockade, formed of brilliant &s;tones of the three national colours.</P>
<P>Our conver&s;ation on the &s;ubject of the Ba&s;tile, led Madame Brulart to relate an action of Mon&s;. de Chartres, which reflects the high|e&s;t honour on his humanity. Being in Nor|mandy, he vi&s;ited Mont St. Michel, a fortre&s;s built on a rock which &s;tands a league and a half from the coa&s;t of Normandy. The tide covers this &s;pace twice every twenty-four hours; but when it is low-water, a per&s;on can pa&s;s over on foot. Mont St. Michel was originally a church, founded by a good bi&s;hop in the &s;eventh century, in honour of St. Michel, who, it &s;eems, appeared to him in a vi&s;ion on this &s;pot. Richard the Fir&s;t, Duke of Normandy, of that name, afterwards converted the church into an abbey, and this abbey gave ri&s;e to the military order des Chevaliers de St. Michel, in&s;tituted by Louis the Eleventh. After hav|ing &s;een the precious relics of the abbey, the &s;quare buckler, and the &s;hort &s;word found in Ireland near the body of the well-known drag|on, who&s;e de&s;truction is attributed to the prow|e&s;s of St. Michel, Mon&s;. de Chartres was con|ducted,
<PB N="28" REF="024003_0028_0FC2E14E8C15D388">
through many labyrinths, to the &s;ub|terraneous parts of the edifice; where he was &s;hewn a wooden cage, which was made by or|der of Louis the Fourteenth, for the puni&s;h|ment of an unfortunate wit, who had dared to ridicule his conque&s;ts in Holland, no &s;ooner gained than lo&s;t. Mon&s;. de Chartres beheld with horror this in&s;trument of tyranny, in which pri&s;oners were &s;till frequently confined; and, expre&s;&s;ing in very &s;trong terms his indignation, he was told, that, as a Prince of the blood, he had a right, if he thought proper, to order the cage to be de&s;troyed. Scarcely were the words pronounced, when the young Prince &s;eized a hatchet, gave the fir&s;t &s;troke him&s;elf to this execrable machine, waited to &s;ee it levelled with the ground, and thus may claim the glory of having, even before the demolition of the Ba&s;tile, begun the French revolution.</P>
<P>We found at St. Leu, a young Engli&s;h lady, who is the companion of the Prince&s;s, and who&s;e appearance is calculated to give the mo&s;t favourable idea of Engli&s;h beauty. I never &s;aw more regular features, or an expre&s;&s;ion of countenance more lovely; and Madame Bru|lart, by whom &s;he has been educated, a&s;&s;ured me that "the mind keeps the promi&s;e we had from the face."

<P>I HAVE been at the National A&s;&s;em|bly, where, at a time when the deputies from the provinces engro&s;&s;ed every ticket of ad|mi&s;&s;ion, my &s;i&s;ter and I were admitted without tickets, by the gentleman who had the com|mand of the guard, and placed in the be&s;t &s;eats, before he &s;uffered the doors to be open|ed to other people. We had no per&s;onal ac|quaintance with this gentleman, or any claim to his politene&s;s, except that of being foreign|ers and women; but the&s;e are, of all claims, the mo&s;t powerful to Frenchmen.</P>
<P>My &s;i&s;ter ob&s;erved to me, that our &s;eats, which were immediately oppo&s;ite the tribune from which the members &s;peak, reminded her of our &s;truggles to attain the &s;ame &s;ituation in We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall. I believe, however, &s;aid I, that if the &s;ame of Mr. Fox's eloquence &s;hould lead a French woman to pre&s;ent her|&s;elf at the door of We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall without a ticket, &s;he might &s;tand there as long as Mr. Ha&s;tings's trial has la&s;ted, without being per|mitted to pa&s;s the barrier.</P>
<P>The hall of the National A&s;&s;embly is long and narrow; at each end there is a gallery, where the common people are admitted by applying very early in the morning for num|bers, which are di&s;tributed at the door; and
<PB N="30" REF="024003_0030_0FC2E153E82DCC10">
the per&s;ons who fir&s;t apply &s;ecure the fir&s;t numbers. The &s;eats bring al&s;o numbered, all confu&s;ion and di&s;order are prevented. The galleries at the &s;ide of the hall are divided in|to boxes, which are called tribunes. They belong to the principal members of the Na|tional A&s;&s;embly, and to the&s;e places company are admitted with tickets. Rows of &s;eats are placed round the hall, rai&s;ed one above anoth|er, where the members of the A&s;&s;embly are &s;eated; and immediately oppo&s;ite the chair of the pre&s;ident, in the narrow part of the hall, is the tribune which the members a&s;cend when they are going to &s;peak. One capital &s;ubject of debate in this A&s;&s;embly is, who &s;hall &s;peak fir&s;t; for all &s;eem more inclined to talk than to li&s;ten; and &s;ometimes the pre&s;ident in vain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ings a bell, or with the vehemence of French action &s;tretches out his arms, and endeavours to impo&s;e &s;ilence; while the &s;ix Hui&s;&s;ers, per|&s;ons who are appointed to keep order, make the attempt with as little &s;ucce&s;s as the pre&s;i|dent him&s;elf. But of how little con&s;equence is this impetuo&s;ity in debate, if the decrees which are pa&s;&s;ed are wi&s;e and beneficial, and the new con&s;titution ari&s;es, like the beauty and order of nature, from the confu&s;ion of mingled elements! I was highly gratified by hearing &s;everal of the members &s;peak. Their manner of &s;peaking in the National A&s;&s;embly is remarkably &s;low and di&s;tinct, and very dif|ferent from the u&s;ual volubility of Frenchmen.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="024003_0031_0FC2E1554429C3F0">And this, repeated I with exultation to my|&s;elf, this is the National A&s;&s;embly of France! Tho&s;e men now before my eyes are the men who engro&s;s the attention, the a&s;toni&s;hment of Europe; for the i&s;&s;ue of who&s;e decrees &s;ur|rounding nations wait in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, and who&s;e fame has already extended through every civi|lized region of the globe: The men who&s;e magnanimity inve&s;ted them with power to de&s;troy the old con&s;titution, and who&s;e wi&s;|dom is erecting the new, on a principle of perfection which has hitherto been thought chimerical, and has only &s;erved to adorn the page of the philo&s;opher; but which they be|lieve may be reduced to practice, and have therefore the courage to attempt. My mind, with a &s;en&s;ation of elevated plea&s;ure, pa&s;&s;ing through the interval of ages, anticipated the increa&s;ing renown of the&s;e legi&s;lators, and the period when, all the nations of Europe follow|ing the liberal &s;y&s;tem which France has adopt|ed, the general policy of the pre&s;ent times &s;hall give place to the reign of rea&s;on, virtue and &s;cience.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t celebrated characters in the Na|tional A&s;&s;embly were pointed out to us. Mon|&s;ieur Barnave de Dauphine, who is only &s;ix and twenty years of age, and the younge&s;t mem|ber of the A&s;&s;embly, is e&s;teemed its fir&s;t orator, and is the leader of the democratic party. I believe Mon&s;. Barnave does not owe all his rep|utation to his talents, however di&s;tingui&s;hed:
<PB N="32" REF="024003_0032_0FC2E15812252058">
His virtues al&s;o claim a con&s;iderable &s;hare of that applau&s;e which he receives from his coun|try. He has &s;hewn him&s;elf as &s;tedfa&s;t in prin|ciple, as he is eloquent in debate. With firm undeviating integrity he has defended the cau&s;e of the people. Every motion he has made in the A&s;&s;embly has pa&s;&s;ed into a law, becau&s;e its beneficial tendency has been always evi|dent; and it was he who effected that memo|rable decree which deprived the King of the power of making war, without the con&s;ent of the nation.

<P>We al&s;o &s;aw Mon&s;.

I am, how|ever, one of his partizans, though not merely from that enthu&s;ia&s;m which always comes a|cro&s;s my heart in favour of great intellectual abilities. Mon&s;. Mirabeau has another very powerful claim on my partiality: He is the profe&s;&s;ed friend (and I mu&s;t and will love him for being &s;o) of the African race. He has propo&s;ed the abolition of the &s;lave trade to the National A&s;&s;embly, and, though the A&s;&s;embly have delayed the con&s;ideration of this &s;ubject, on account of tho&s;e deliberations which im|mediately affect the country, yet, perhaps, if our Senators continue to doze over this affair as they have hitherto done, the French will have the glory of &s;etting us an example, which
<PB N="33" REF="024003_0033_0FC2E165B755DCF0">
it will then be our humble employment to fol|low. But I tru&s;t the period will never come, when England will &s;ubmit to be taught by another nation the le&s;&s;on of humanity. I tru&s;t an Engli&s;h Hou&s;e of Commons will never per&s;i&s;t in thinking, that what is morally wrong, can be politically right; that the virtue and the pro&s;perity of a people are things at vari|ance with each other; and that a country which abounds with &s;o many &s;ources of wealth, cannot afford to clo&s;e one polluted channel, which is &s;tained with the blood of our fellow-creatures.</P>
<P>But it is a &s;ort of trea&s;on to the honour, the &s;pirit, the genero&s;ity of Engli&s;hmen, to &s;uppo&s;e they will per&s;evere in &s;uch conduct. Admit|ting, however, a &s;uppo&s;ition which it is pain|ful to make, admitting that they &s;hould abide by this &s;y&s;tem of inhumanity, they will only retard, but will not finally prevent the aboli|tion of &s;lavery. The Africans have not per|haps long to &s;uffer, nor their oppre&s;&s;ors to triumph. Europe &s;eems ha&s;tening towards a period too enlightened for the perpetuation of &s;uch mon&s;trous abu&s;es. The mi&s;ts of igno|rance and error are rolling fa&s;t away, and the benign beams of philo&s;ophy are &s;preading their lu&s;tre over the nations. But whither have the&s;e children of captivity led me? I perceive I have wandered a great way from the Na|tion A&s;&s;embly, where I was &s;o happily &s;eated, and of which I will tell you more in my next letter.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VII.</HEAD>
<P>THE Abb&eacute; Maury is one of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed members of the National A&s;&s;em|bly. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a&s;toni&s;hing powers of elo|quence; but he has done his talents the inju&s;|tice to make them &s;ub&s;ervient to the narrow con&s;iderations of &s;elf-intere&s;t&punc; had he di&s;play|ed that ability in defence of civil and religious liberty, which he has employed in the &s;ervice of the exorbitant preten&s;ions of the church, he would have de&s;erved the highe&s;t applau&s;e of his country; in&s;tead of which, he has called to the aid of his genius an auxiliary it ought to have &s;corned; that &s;ubtlety which tries "to make the wor&s;e appear the better rea&s;on;" and he is &s;till more dete&s;ted than admired. I am not &s;urpri&s;ed that a little mind is &s;ometimes tempted by intere&s;t to tread in a mean and &s;or|did path; but I own it does a&s;toni&s;h me that genius can be &s;educed from the fair field of honorable fame into tho&s;e &s;erpentine ways where it can meet, with no object worthy of its ambition. "Something too much of this." You &s;hall hear a repartee of the Abb&eacute; Maury, who, after having made a very unpopular motion in the A&s;&s;embly, was in&s;ulted as he was going out; the people crying, as they are too apt to do, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To the lantern</NOTE> "A la lanterne." The Abb&eacute;, turning to the

Me&s;&s;ieurs, &s;i j'etois &agrave; l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> lanterne, &s;eriez vous plus eclair&eacute;s?" The Abb&eacute; Maury, before the revolution, was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of eight hundred farms, and has lo&s;t &s;ixty thou&s;and li|vres a year in con&s;equence of that event. But enough of Mon&s;. l'Abb&eacute;, who&s;e picture I have ju&s;t purcha&s;ed in a &s;nuff-box. You touch a &s;pring, open the lid of the &s;nuff-box, and the Abb&eacute; jumps up, and occa&s;ions much &s;ur|pri&s;e and merriment. The joke, however, is grown a little &s;tale in France; but I &s;hall bring the Abb&eacute; with me to England, where I flatter my&s;elf his &s;udden appearance will afford &s;ome diver&s;ion.</P>
<P>A &s;ingular but very re&s;pectable figure in the National A&s;&s;embly, is a Deputy from Britany, called Le Pere Gerard. This venerable old man is a pea&s;ant, and his appearance reminds one of tho&s;e times when Generals were called from the plough to take the command of armies. The dre&s;s of Le Pere Gerard is made of a coar&s;e woollen cloth, which is worn by the pea&s;ants of Britany, and is of &s;uch &s;trong tex|ture, that a coat often de&s;cends from one gen|eration to another. This cloth is called Pinch|ina; and the king, to whom the old Breton has pre&s;ented &s;everal addre&s;&s;es from the A&s;|&s;embly, calls him, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In plea&s;antry, Father Pinchina.</NOTE> en badinage, Le Pere
<PB N="36" REF="024003_0036_0FC2E171F0FF1740">
Pinchina. When I &s;aw him, he had on this everla&s;ting coat, and wore wor&s;ted &s;tockings gartered above the knees. But, what plea&s;ed me mo&s;t in his appearance, were the long white hairs which hung down his &s;houlders; an or|nament for which you know I have a particu|lar predilection.</P>
<P>The re&s;pectable Pere Gerard boa&s;ts that he is de&s;cended from a race of deputies, his great grand-father having been cho&s;en as a deputy to the States General in 1614, the la&s;t time they were held, before that memorable period when they effected the revolution.</P>
<P>At the time when the ladies &s;et the example of the patriotic donation, by offering their jew|els, and the members of the National A&s;&s;em|bly, in a moment of enthu&s;ia&s;m, took the &s;ilver buckles out of their &s;hoes, and laid them on the Pre&s;ident's table, the Pere Gerard ro&s;e, and &s;aid, that, he had no &s;uch offering to give, his buckles being made of bra&s;s, but that his don patriotique &s;hould be that of rendering his &s;er|vices to his country unpaid. The old man was heard by the A&s;&s;embly with the applau&s;e he merited; and the people, on the day of the Federation, carried him from the Champ de Mars to his own hou&s;e in triumph on their &s;houlders.</P>
<P>Me&s;&s;ieurs Charles and Alexander Lameth, two brothers, and Mon&s;. Rabeau de St. E&s;tienne, are among the fir&s;t patriots of the Nation|al A&s;&s;embly, and have a very high reputation for talents. The French, who love what they

call an equivoque, tell you, que Mon&s;. Ra|beau vaut deux de Mi Rabeau.</P>
<P>The meetings of the A&s;&s;embly, though &s;till tumultuous, are much le&s;s &s;o than they were at their commencement. A gentleman, who was pre&s;ent when the motion was made for aboli&s;hing mona&s;teries, told me, that the minds of the members were, on that occa&s;ion, inflam|ed to &s;uch a height, that it appeared to him very probable, that the debate would end in a ma&s;&s;acre. He mentioned a circum&s;tance very characteri&s;tic of French vivacity. One of the members was expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf in the&s;e words, "What is a Monk? A man who has renounced his father, his mother, every tie, every affection that is dear in nature! and for whom?"&mdash;before the &s;peaker could fini&s;h his &s;entence, a member from the other end of the hall &s;eized the moment while the orator was drawing his breath, and called out <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For a foreign power.</NOTE> "Pour une pui&s;&s;ance &eacute;trang&eacute;re," to the great horror du c&ocirc;t&eacute; noir, for &s;o the clergy are called.</P>
<P>The Democrates place them&s;elves on one &s;ide of the hall, and the Ari&s;tocrates on the other. The &s;pectators in the galleries take &s;uch a part in the debate, as frequently to ex|pre&s;s their applau&s;e by clapping their hands with great violence. An old Marechal of France ro&s;e, the day I was at the A&s;&s;embly&punc; when they were debating on the military pen|&s;ions, and declared, that in recompen&s;e for the &s;ervices which he had rendered his country&punc;
<PB N="38" REF="024003_0038_0FC2E17B67BA8C28">
he de&s;ired honours, and not pay. The A&s;&s;em|bly clapped him, and the galleries joined in this mark of approbation. A young Frenchman, who &s;at next me, whi&s;pered to me <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I &s;uppo&s;e that gentleman finds money trouble+&s;ome.</NOTE> "Mon&s;. trouve apparamment que l'argent l'incom|mode."</P>
<P>The members of the National A&s;&s;embly are paid three crowns a day for their attendance; while in England a candidate for a &s;eat in par|liament often &s;pends many thou&s;and pounds, and, with magnificent genero&s;ity, makes a whole county drunk for a week, merely to en|joy the privilege of &s;erving his country with|out pay.</P>
<P>The qualification requi&s;ite for a member of the National A&s;&s;embly, is that of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;ufficient property in land or hou&s;es to pay tax|es to the amount of a marc d'argent, which is the value of four louis. Every hundred of the citizens, who pay taxes to government of three days labour, or three livres, have a right to vote far an elector; who&s;e qualification is that of paying taxes to the amount of ten livres, or ten days labour. The electors of one depart|ment meet together in one a&s;&s;embly, and choo&s;e from among their own body the per&s;ons who are to direct the admini&s;tration of that depart|ment. Tho&s;e electors will al&s;o choo&s;e in the &s;ame manner the deputies &s;ent by that depart|ment to the National A&s;&s;embly. There will therefore be only one intermediate degree be|tween
<PB N="39" REF="024003_0039_0FC2E17C622EDEA8">
the lowe&s;t order of active citizens, and the members of the National A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>I was interrupted by a vi&s;itor, who related a little incident, which has intere&s;ted me &s;o much, that I can write of nothing el&s;e at pre&s;|ent, and you &s;hall therefore have it warm from my heart. While the National A&s;&s;em|bly were deliberating upon the divi&s;ion of property among brothers, a young man of high birth and fortune, who is a member of the A&s;|&s;embly, entered with precipitation, and, mount|ing the tribune, with great emotion informed the A&s;&s;embly, that he had ju&s;t received ac|counts that his father was dying; that he him&s;elf was his elde&s;t &s;on, and had come to conjure the A&s;&s;embly to pa&s;s, without delay, that equitable decree, giving the younger &s;ons an equal &s;hare of fortune with the elde&s;t, in order, he &s;aid, that his father might have the &s;atisfaction, before he breathed his la&s;t, of knowing that all his children were &s;ecure of a provi&s;ion. If you are not affected by this circum&s;tance, you have read it with very dif|ferent feelings from tho&s;e with which I have written it: But if, on the contrary, you have fallen in love with this young Frenchman, do not imagine your pa&s;&s;ion is &s;ingular, for I am violently in love with him my&s;elf.</P>

<P>YOU have not heard, perhaps, that on the day of the Federation at Paris the na|tional oath was taken throughout the whole kingdom, at the hour of twelve.</P>
<P>A great number of farmers and pea&s;ants walk|ed in the proce&s;&s;ion at Rouen, bearing in their hands the in&s;truments of their hu&s;bandry, decorated with national ribbons. The nation|al guard cut down branches from the trees, and &s;tuck them in their hats; and a French gentle|man of my acquaintance, who under&s;tands Engli&s;h, and reads Shake&s;peare, told me, that it &s;eemed like Birnham Wood coming to Dun|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nane.</P>
<P>The leaders of the French Revolution, are men well acquainted with the human heart. They have not tru&s;ted merely to the force of rea&s;on, but have &s;tudied to intere&s;t in their cau&s;e the mo&s;t powerful pa&s;&s;ions of human na|ture, by the appointment of &s;olemnities per|fectly calculated to awaken that general &s;ympa|thy which is caught from heart to heart with irre&s;i&s;tible energy, fills every eye with tears, and throbs in every bo&s;om.</P>
<P>I have heard of a proce&s;&s;ion, which took place not long ago, in one of the di&s;tricts of Paris, in which five hundred young ladies walked dre&s;&s;ed in white, and decorated with
<PB N="41" REF="024003_0041_0FC2E17F42B8FDB0">
cockades of the national ribbon, leading by &s;ilken cords a number of pri&s;oners newly re|lea&s;ed from captivity; and who, with their fac|es covered by long flowing veils, were con|ducted to a church, where they returned thanks for their deliverance.</P>
<P>Thus have the leaders of the Revolution en|gaged beauty as one of their auxiliaries, ju&s;tly concluding, that, to the gallantry and &s;en&s;ibil|ity of Frenchmen, no argument would be found more efficacious than that of a pretty face.</P>
<P>I have ju&s;t read a private letter from a little town about two leagues from Montaubun, call|ed Negre-Peli&s;&s;e, where the inhabitants, on the day of the Federation, di&s;played a liberali|ty of &s;entiment, which reflects honour, not on|ly on them&s;elves, but on the age in which we live. The national guard of this little town and its environs, were a&s;&s;embled to take the national oath. Half of the inhabitants being Prote&s;tants and the other half Catholics, the Cur&eacute; and the Prote&s;tant Mini&s;ter a&s;cended to|gether one altar, which had been erected by the citizens, and admini&s;tered the oath to their re&s;pective pari&s;hioners at the &s;ame moment, after which, Catholics and Prote&s;tants joined in &s;inging Te Deum.</P>
<P>Surely religious wor&s;hip was never perform|ed more truly in the &s;pirit of the Divine au|thor of Chri&s;tanity, who&s;e great precept is that of univer&s;al love!

than when the Catholics and Prote&s;tants of Negre-Peli&s;&s;e offered it together!</P>
<P>This amiable community, when their devo|tions were fini&s;hed, walked in proce&s;&s;ion to a &s;pot where fire-works had been prepared; and, it being con&s;idered as a mark of honor to light the fire-works, the office was re&s;erved for Mon&s;. le Cur&eacute;, who however, in&s;i&s;ted on the participation of the Prote&s;tant Mini&s;ter in this di&s;tinction; upon which the Mini&s;ter received a wax taper from the Cur&eacute;, and with him led the proce&s;&s;ion. The fire-works repre&s;ented two trees: One, twi&s;ted and di&s;torted, was em|blematical of ari&s;tocracy, and was &s;oon entire|ly con&s;umed; when a tall &s;traight plant, figu|rative of patrioti&s;m, appeared to ri&s;e from the a&s;hes of the former, and continued to burn with undimini&s;hed &s;plendor.</P>
<P>When we look back on the ignorance, the &s;uper&s;tition, the barbarous per&s;ecution of Gothic times, is it not &s;omething to be thank|ful for, that we exi&s;t at this enlightened period, when &s;uch evils are no more; when particular tenets of religious belief are no longer imput|ed as crimes; when the human mind has made as many important di&s;coveries in morality as in &s;cience, and liberality of &s;entiment is culti|vated with as much &s;ucce&s;s as arts and learn|ing; when, in &s;hort (and <HI>you</HI> are not one of tho&s;e who will &s;u&s;pect that I am not all the while a good Engli&s;h-woman) when one can witne&s;s an event &s;o &s;ublime as the French Revolution?</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IX.</HEAD>
<P>YESTERDAY I received your letter in which you accu&s;e me of de&s;cribing with too much enthu&s;ia&s;m the public rejoicings of France, and prophe&s;y that I &s;hall return to my own country a fierce republican. In an&s;wer to the&s;e accu&s;ations, I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that it is very difficult, with common &s;en&s;ibility, to avoid &s;ympathizing in general happine&s;s. My love of the French revolution, is the natural re&s;ult of this &s;ympathy, and therefore my po|litical creed is entirely an affair of the heart; for I have not been &s;o ab&s;urd as to con&s;ult my head upon matters of which it is &s;o incapable of judging. If I were at Rome, you would not be &s;urpri&s;ed to hear that I had vi&s;ited, with the warme&s;t reverence, every &s;pot where any relics of her ancient grandeur could be traced; that I had flown to the capitol, that I had ki&s;&s;|ed the earth on which the Roman Senate &s;at in council: And can you then expect me to have &s;een the Federation at the Champ de Mars, and the National A&s;&s;embly of France, with in|difference? Before you in&s;i&s;t that I ought to have done &s;o, point out to me, in the page of Roman hi&s;tory, a &s;pectacle more &s;olemn, more affecting, than the Champ de Mars exhibited, or more magnanimous, more noble efforts in the cau&s;e of liberty than have been made by the National A&s;&s;embly. Whether the new
<PB N="44" REF="024003_0044_0FC2E192D3265BE8">
form of government, e&s;tabli&s;hing in France, be more or le&s;s perfect than our own,
<Q><L>Who &s;hall decide, when doctors di&s;agree.</L>
<L>And &s;ounde&s;t ca&s;ui&s;ts doubt, like you and me?</L></Q>
I fancy we had better leave the determination of this que&s;tion to po&s;terity. In the mean time, I wi&s;h that &s;ome of our political critics would &s;peak with le&s;s contempt, than they are apt to do, of the new con&s;titution of France, and no longer repeat after one another the trite remark, that the French have gone too far, becau&s;e they have gone farther than our|&s;elves; as if it were not po&s;&s;ible that that de|gree of influence which is perfectly &s;afe in the hand of the executive part of our government, might be dangerous, at this cri&s;is, to the liberty of France. But be this as it may, it appears ev|ident that the temple of Freedom, which they are erecting, even if imperfect in &s;ome of its proportions, mu&s;t be preferable to the old gloomy Gothic fabric which they have laid in ruins. And therefore, when I hear my good countrymen, who guard their own rights with &s;uch unremitting vigilance, and who would rather part with life than liberty, &s;peak with contempt of the French for having imbibed the noble le&s;&s;on which England has taught, I cannot but &s;u&s;pect that &s;ome mean jealou&s;y lurks beneath the ungenerous cen&s;ure. I can|not but &s;u&s;pect, that, while the fair and honor|able traders of our commercial country act with the mo&s;t liberal &s;pirit in their ordinary
<PB N="45" REF="024003_0045_0FC2E194463468D0">
dealings with other nations, they wi&s;h to make a monopoly of liberty, and are angry that France &s;hould claim a &s;hare of that prec|ious property; by which, however, &s;he may &s;urely be enriched, without our being impov|eri&s;hed. The French, on the contrary, &s;eem to have imbibed, with the principles of liberty, the &s;tronge&s;t &s;entiments of re&s;pect and friend|&s;hip towards that people, whom they grateful|ly acknowledge to have been their ma&s;ters in this &s;cience. They are, to u&s;e their own phra&s;e, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Become madly fond of the Engli&s;h.</NOTE> "devenus fous des Anglois," and fondly im|agine that the applau&s;e they have received from a &s;ociety of philo&s;ophers in our country, is the general voice of the nation.</P>
<P>Whether the new con&s;titution be compo&s;ed of durable materials or not, I leave to politi|cians to determine; but it requires no extraor|dinary &s;agacity to pronounce, that the French will henceforth be free. The love of liberty has pervaded all ranks of the people, who, if its ble&s;&s;ings mu&s;t be purcha&s;ed with blood, will not &s;hrink from paying the price:
<Q><L>While ev'n the pea&s;ant boa&s;ts his right to &s;can,</L>
<L>And learns to venerate him&s;elf as man.</L></Q>
The enthu&s;ia&s;tic &s;pirit of liberty di&s;plays it&s;elf, not merely on the days of &s;olemn ceremonies; occupies not only every &s;erious deliberation; but is mingled with the gaiety of &s;ocial enjoy|ment. When they conver&s;e, liberty is the theme of di&s;cour&s;e; when they dance, the fig|ure
<PB N="46" REF="024003_0046_0FC2E1A1FA8FE1E0">
of the cotillion is adapted to a national tune&punc; and when they &s;ing, it is but to repeat a vow of fidelity to the con&s;titution, at which all who are pre&s;ent in&s;tantly join in chorus, and &s;portively lift up their hands in confirmation of this favourite &s;entiment.</P>
<P>In every &s;treet, you &s;ee children performing the military exerci&s;e, and carrying banners made of paper of the national colours, wearing grenadiers caps of the &s;ame compo&s;ition, and armed, though not like Jack the Giant-killer, with &s;words of &s;harpne&s;s.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, liberty appears in France adorned with the fre&s;hne&s;s of youth, and is lov|ed with the ardour of pa&s;&s;ion. In England &s;he is &s;een in her matron &s;tate, and, like other ladies at that period, is beheld with &s;ober ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|eration.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to my&s;elf, I mu&s;t acknowl|edge, that, in my admiration of the revolution in France, I blend the feelings of private friend&s;hip with my &s;ympathy in public ble&s;&s;|ings; &s;ince the old con&s;titution is connected in my mind with the image of a friend con|fined in the gloomy rece&s;&s;es of a dungeon, and pining in hopele&s;s captivity; while, with the new con&s;titution, I unite the &s;oothing idea of his return to pro&s;perity, honours, and happi|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>This per&s;on is Mon&s;. du F&mdash;, who&s;e lady I am come to France to vi&s;it. They are friends, with whom I wept in the day of their adver&s;ity, and with whom in their pro&s;perity,

<P>WE have been driving at a furious rate, for &s;everal days pa&s;t, through the city of Paris, which I think bears the &s;ame re&s;em|blance to London (if you will allow me the indulgence of a &s;imile) that the grand natural objects in a rude and barren country, bear to the tame but regular beauties of a &s;cene, rich with cultivation. The &s;treets of Paris are narrow, dark, and dirty; but we are repaid for this by noble edifices, which powerfully inter|e&s;t the attention. The &s;treets of London are broad, airy, light, and elegant; but I need not tell you that they lead &s;carcely to any edifices at which foreigners do not look with contempt.

Fine painting gives me con&s;idera|ble plea&s;ure, but has not the power of calling forth my &s;en&s;ibility, like fine poetry; and I am willing to believe that the art I love, is the mo&s;t perfect of the two; and that it would

have been impo&s;&s;ible for the pencil of Raphael to convey all tho&s;e ideas to the mind, and ex|cite all tho&s;e emotions in the heart, which are awakened by the pen of Shake&s;peare.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, the only picture in Paris which has co&s;t me any tears is that of La Valliere, in the convent of the Carmelites. She is repre|&s;ented in the habit of a Carmelite; all the form|er ornaments of her per&s;on lie &s;cattered at her feet; and her eyes are ca&s;t up to Heaven with a look of the deepe&s;t angui&s;h. While I gazed at her picture, I lamented that &s;en&s;ibility which led into the mo&s;t fatal errors a mind that &s;eems to have been formed for virtue, and which, even in the bo&s;om of plea&s;ure, bewailed its own weakne&s;s. How can one forbear regretting, that the capricious incon&s;tant monarch, to whom &s;he gave her heart, &s;hould have in&s;pired a pa&s;&s;ion of which he was &s;o unworthy; a pa&s;|&s;ion which appears to have been wholly un|mixed with intere&s;t, vanity, or ambition? And how can one avoid pitying the de&s;olate peni|tent, who, for &s;o many years, in the di&s;mal gloom of a convent, deplored her errors, and felt at once the bitterne&s;s of remor&s;e, and the agony of di&s;appointed love? while, probably,

You walk under piazzas round this &s;quare, which is &s;urrounded with coffee-hou&s;es. and &s;hops di&s;playing a variety of ribbons, trink|ets, and caricature prints, which are now as common at Paris as at London. The walks under the piazzas are crowded with people; and in the upper part of the &s;quare, tents are placed, where coffee, lemonade, ices, &amp;c. are &s;old. Nothing is heard but the voice of mirth; nothing is &s;een but cheerful faces: and I have no doubt that the Palais Royal is, upon the whole, one of the merrie&s;t &s;cenes under the &s;un. Indeed, what is mo&s;t &s;triking to a &s;tranger at Paris, is that general appear|ance of gaiety, which it is ea&s;y to perceive, is not a&s;&s;umed for the moment, but is the habit of the mind, and which is, therefore, &s;o exhil|arating to a &s;pectator of any benevolence. It is this which gives &s;uch a charm to every pub|lic place and walk in Paris. Ken&s;ington Gardens can boa&s;t as fine verdure, as maje&s;tic trees, as noble walks, and perhaps more beau|tiful women, than the gardens of the Thuille|ries; but we &s;hall look in vain for that &s;pright|ly animation, that everla&s;ting cheerfulne&s;s, which render the Thuilleries &s;o enchanting.</P>

<P>A few days before the taking of the Ba&s;tile, a crowd of the Pari&s;ians a&s;&s;embled at the Hop|ital des Invalides, and demanded arms of the old &s;oldiers; who an&s;wered, that they were the friends of their fellow citizens, but dur&s;t not deliver up their arms without the appear|ance of a conte&s;t; and therefore de&s;ired that the people would a&s;&s;emble before the gates in greater numbers the next day, when, after fir|ing a little powder upon them, they would throw down their arms. The people accord|ingly returned the following day; and the in|valids, after a faint &s;hew of re&s;i&s;tance, threw down their arms, which the citizens took up, embraced the old men, and then departed.</P>
<P>We &s;topped ye&s;terday at La Mai&s;on de Ville, and went into a large apartment where the mayor and corporation a&s;&s;emble. The walls are hung round with pictures of Kings and Dukes, which I looked at with much le&s;s re&s;pect than at the chair on which Mon&s;. Bailly &s;its.

<P>WE are ju&s;t returned from Ver&s;ailles, where I could not help fancying I &s;aw, in the back ground of that magnificent abode of a de&s;pot, the gloomy dungeons of the Ba&s;tile, which &s;till haunt my imagination, and prevented my being much dazzled by the &s;plendor of this &s;uperb palace.</P>
<P>We were &s;hewn the pa&s;&s;ages through which the Queen e&s;caped from her own apartment to the King's on the memorable night when the <HI>Poi&s;&s;ardes</HI> vi&s;ited Ver&s;ailles, and al&s;o the bal|cony at which &s;he &s;tood with the Dauphin in her arms, when, after having remained a few hours concealed in &s;ome &s;ecret rece&s;s of the palace, it was thought proper to comply with the de&s;ire of the crowd, who repeatedly de|manded her pre&s;ence. I could not help moral|izing a little, on being told that the apartment to which this balcony belongs, is the very room in which Louis the Fourteenth died; little &s;u&s;|pecting what a &s;cene would, in the cour&s;e of a few years, be acted on that &s;pot.</P>
<P>All the bread which could be procured in the town of Ver&s;ailles, was di&s;tributed among the <HI>Poi&s;&s;ardes</HI>; who, with &s;avage ferocity, held up their mor&s;els of bread on their bloody pikes, towards the balcony where the Queen &s;tood; crying, in a tone of defiance, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We now have bread.</NOTE> "Nous avons du pain!"</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="024003_0054_0FC2E1C7DD0A6320">During the whole of the journey from Ver|&s;ailles to Paris, the Queen held the Dauphin in her arms, who had been previou&s;ly taught to put his infant hands together, and attempt to &s;often the enraged multitude by repeating <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Spare mamma!</NOTE>"Grace pour maman!"</P>
<P>Mon&s;. de la Fayette prevented the whole Gardes du Corps from being ma&s;&s;acred at Ver|&s;ailles, by calling to the incen&s;ed people, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The King begs of you to &s;pare his body-guards.</NOTE> "Le Roi vous demande grace pour &s;es Gardes du Corps." The voice of Mon&s;. de la Fayette was li&s;tened to and obeyed. The Gardes du Corps were &s;pared; with whom, before they &s;et out for Paris, the people exchanged clothes, giving them al&s;o national cockades; and, as a farther protection from danger, part of the crowd mounted on the hor&s;es of the Gardes du Corps, each man taking an officer behind him. Before the King came out of La Mai|&s;on du Ville, Mon&s;. de la Fayette appeared, and told the multitude, who had pre&s;erved an indignant &s;ilence the whole way from Ver|&s;ailles to Paris, that the King had expre&s;&s;ed &s;entiments of the &s;tronge&s;t affection for his people, and had accepted the national cockade; and that he (Mon&s;. de la Fayette) hoped, when his Maje&s;ty came out of la Mai&s;on du Ville, they would te&s;tify their gratitude.

<P>The Queen is, I am told, much altered late|ly in her appearance, but &s;he is &s;till a fine wom|an. Madame is a beautiful girl; and the Dauphin, who is about &s;even years of age, is the idol of the people. They expect that he will be educated in the principles of the new con&s;titution, and will be taught to con&s;ider him&s;elf le&s;s a King than a citizen. He appears to be a &s;weet engaging child, and I have ju&s;t heard one of his &s;ayings repeated. He has a collection of animals, which he feeds with his own hand. A few days ago, an ungrateful rabbit, who was his fir&s;t favourite, bit his finger when he was giving him food. The Prince, while &s;marting with the pain, called out to his <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Little rabbit, Thou art an Ari&s;tocrate.&mdash;And pray, my Lord, what is an Ari&s;tocrate?&mdash;Tho&s;e who make my papa unea&s;y.</NOTE> petit lapin, "Tu e&s;t Ari&s;tocrate."

<P>When the French guards laid down their arms at Ver&s;ailles, their officers endeavoured to per&s;uade them to take them up.

<P>While we were &s;itting, after dinner, at the inn at Ver&s;ailles, the door was &s;uddenly open|ed, and a Franci&s;can friar entered the room. He had &s;o &s;trong a re&s;emblance to Sterne's monk, that I am per&s;uaded he mu&s;t be a de|&s;cendant

<P>WE have been at all the Theatres, and I am charmed with the comic actors. The tragic performers afforded me much le&s;s plea&s;|ure. Before we can admire Madame Ve&s;tris, the fir&s;t tragic actre&s;s of Paris, we mu&s;t have lo&s;t the impre&s;&s;ion (a thing impo&s;&s;ible) of Mrs. Siddons's performance; who, in&s;tead of "tearing a pa&s;&s;ion to rags," like Madame Ve&s;tris, only tears the hearts of the audience with &s;ympathy.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the pieces we have &s;een at the French theatres, have been little comedies, relative to the circum&s;tances of the times, and, on that account, preferred, in this moment of

enthu&s;ia&s;m, to all the wit of Moliere. The&s;e little pieces might perhaps read coldly enough in your &s;tudy, but have a mo&s;t charming effect with an accompanyment of applau&s;e from &s;ome hundreds of the national guards, the real actors in the &s;cenes repre&s;ented. Between the acts, national &s;ongs are played, in which the whole audience join in chorus. There is one air, in particular, which is &s;o univer&s;al a favourite, that it is called "Le Carrillon National;" the burden of the &s;ong is <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It will go on.</NOTE> "C'a ira." It is &s;ung not only at every theatre, and in every &s;treet of Paris, but in every town and village of France, by man, woman, and child. "C'a ira" is every where the &s;ignal of plea&s;ure, the beloved &s;ound which animates every bo&s;om with delight, and of which every ear is enam|oured.

<P>Giornowiche, the celebrated player on the violin, who was &s;o much the fa&s;hion la&s;t winter at London, I am told, &s;ometimes amu&s;ed him|&s;elf at Paris, by getting up into one of the trees of the Palais Royal, after it was dark, and call|ing forth tones from his violin, fit to "take the pri&s;oned &s;oul, and lap it in Ely&s;ium," He has frequently detained &s;ome thou&s;ands of peo|ple half the night in the Palais Royal, who, before they di&s;covered the performer, u&s;ed to call out in rapture, "Bravo, bravo; <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This is better than Giornowiche.</NOTE> c'e&s;t mieux que Giornowiche."</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="024003_0059_0FC2E1D900F97748">I am ju&s;t returned from &s;eeing the Gobelin tape&s;try, which appears the work of magic. It gave me plea&s;ure to &s;ee two pictures of Henry the Fourth. In one, he is placed at &s;upper with the miller's family; and in the other, he is embracing Sully, who is brought forward on a couch, after having been wounded in bat|tle. Nothing has afforded me more delight, &s;ince I came to France, than the honors which are paid to my favourite hero&punc; Henry the Fourth, whom I prefer to all the Alexanders and Frederics that ever exi&s;ted. They may be terribly &s;ublime, if you will, and have great claims to my admiration; but as for my love, all that portion of it which I be&s;tow on heroes, is already in Henry's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Little &s;tatues of Henry the Fourth and Sully are very common. Sully is repre&s;ented kneel|ing at the feet of this amiable Prince, who holds out his hand to him; and on the ba&s;e of the &s;tatue, are written the words which Sully records in his Memoirs;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">But ri&s;e, pray ri&s;e, Sully; they will believe I am forgiving you.</NOTE> "Mais levez vous, levez vous done, Sully, on croiroit que je vous pardonne."</P>

to Gothic edifices, which, it would &s;eem, were built of &s;uch la&s;ting materials, with the moral purpo&s;e of leading the mind to re|flect on the comparatively &s;hort duration of human life. Frequently an old venerable cro&s;s, placed at the &s;ide of the road by the pie|ty of remote ages, and never pa&s;&s;ed by Roman Catholics without &s;ome mark of re&s;pect, throws a kind of religious &s;anctity over the land&s;cape.</P>
<P>We &s;topped to look at the immen&s;e machine which conveys water to Ver&s;ailles and Marly.

<P>After vi&s;iting the ca&s;tle, I returned &s;omewhat in mournful mood to the inn, where there was nothing calculated to convey one cheerful idea.

<P>ROUEN is one of the large&s;t and mo&s;t commercial towns of France. It is &s;ituated on the banks of the Seine, has a fine quay, and a &s;ingular bridge, of barges placed clo&s;e together, with planks fixed upon them: The bridge ri&s;es and &s;inks with the tide, and opens for ve&s;&s;els to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>The &s;treets of Rouen are &s;o narrow, dark, and frightful, that, to borrow an expre&s;&s;ion from Madame Sevign&eacute;, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"They abu&s;e the permi&s;&s;ion the French &s;treets have of being ugly."</NOTE> "elles abu&s;ent de la permi&s;&s;ion qu'ont les rues Fran&ccedil;oi&s;es d'&eacute;tre laides." There are many figures of Saints to be &s;een from the&s;e ugly &s;treets, placed in lit|tle nitches in the walls. The Virgin Mary is &s;eated in one of the&s;e niches, with the infant in her arms; and in the neighbourhood is St. Anne, who has the credit, with many good catholics, of having taught the Virgin to read. Every night the general darkne&s;s of the town is a little di&s;pelled by the lamps which the people place in the nitches, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">"To liht the Saints."</NOTE> "pour eclairer les Saintes."</P>
<P>Rouen is &s;urrounded by fine boulevards, that form very beautiful walks. On the top of the lull of St. Catharine, which overlooks
<PB N="65" REF="024003_0065_0FC2E1ED8C301A18">
the town, are the ruins of a fort called St. Michell, from which Henry the Fourth be|&s;ieged Rouen. I love to be put in mind of Henry the Fourth, and am therefore very well plea&s;ed, that whenever I go to walk, I can fix my eyes on the hill of St. Catharine.</P>
<P>I always feel a little a&s;hamed of my coun|try, when I pa&s;s the &s;pot where the Maid of Orleans was executed, and on which her &s;tatue &s;tands, a monument of our di&s;grace. The a&s;hes of her per&s;ecutor, John, Duke of Bedford, repo&s;e at no great di&s;tance, within a tomb of black marble, in the cathedral, which was built by the Engli&s;h. One cannot feel much re&s;pect for the judgment of our ance&s;|tors, in choo&s;ing, of all places under the &s;un, the cathedral of Rouen for the tomb of him who&s;e name is tran&s;mitted to us with the epithet of the <HI>good</HI> Duke of Bedford: For you have &s;carcely left the cathedral, before the &s;tatue of Jeane d'Arc &s;tares you in the face, and &s;eems to ca&s;t a mo&s;t formidable &s;hade over the <HI>good</HI> Duke's virtues.</P>
<P>The cathedral is a very magnificent edifice, and the great bell is ten feet high, and weighs thirty-&s;ix thou&s;and pounds. But in France it is not what is <HI>ancient,</HI> but what is <HI>modern,</HI> that mo&s;t powerfully engages attention. Noth|ing in this fine old cathedral intere&s;ted me &s;o much as the con&s;ecrated banner, which, &s;ince the Federation, has been placed over the altar, and on which is in&s;cribed, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Let us live free, or die!</NOTE> "Vivons libres,
<PB N="66" REF="024003_0066_0FC2E1F09D592730">
ou mourir!" I hope every Frenchman, who enters the cathedral of Rouen, while he reads the in&s;cription on this con&s;ecrated banner, re|peats from the bottom of his &s;oul, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Let us live free, or die!</NOTE> "Vivons libres ou mourir!" But the French will, I tru&s;t, e&s;cape the horrors of civil war, notwith|&s;tanding the gloomy forebodings of the ene|mies of the new con&s;titution.</P>
<P>A people ju&s;t delivered from the yoke of oppre&s;&s;ion, will &s;urely have little inclination to re&s;ume their &s;hackles; to rebuild the dun|geons they have &s;o lately demoli&s;hed; to clo&s;e again tho&s;e gloomy mona&s;tic gates which are now thrown open; to exchange their new courts and judicature, founded on the ba&s;is of ju&s;tice and humanity, for the caprice of power, and the dark iniquity of letters de cach&eacute;t; to quench the fair &s;tar of liberty, which has ari&s;en on their hemi&s;phere, and &s;uffer them&s;elves to be once more guided by the meteor of de&s;poti&s;m.</P>
<P>A very con&s;iderable number, even among the nobility of France, have had the virtue to &s;upport the cau&s;e of freedom; and, forgetting the little con&s;iderations of vanity, which have &s;ome importance in the ordinary cour&s;e of hu|man affairs, but which are lo&s;t and annihilated when the mind is animated by any great &s;enti|ment, they have cho&s;en to become the bene|factors rather than the oppre&s;&s;ors of their coun|try; the citizens of a free &s;tate, in&s;tead of the &s;laves of a de&s;potic monarch. They will no longer bear arms to gratify the ambition, or
<PB N="67" REF="024003_0067_0FC2E2015FEC2A38">
the caprice of a mini&s;ter; they will no longer exert that impetuous and gallant &s;pirit, for which they have ever been di&s;tingui&s;hed, in any cau&s;e unworthy of its efforts. The fire of valour, which they have too often employed for the purpo&s;es of de&s;truction, will henceforth be directed to more generous ends. They will choo&s;e another path to renown. In&s;tead of at|tempting to take the citadel of glory by &s;torm, they will prefer the fame of an honourable de|fence, and, renouncing the &s;anguinary laurel, &s;trive, with more exalted enthu&s;ia&s;m, to obtain the civic wreath. Yes, the French nation will inviolably guard, will tran&s;mit to po&s;terity the &s;acred rights of freedom. Future ages will celebrate, with grateful commemoration, the fourteenth of July; and &s;trangers, when they vi&s;it France, will ha&s;ten with impatience to the Champ de Mars, filled with that enthu&s;ia&s;m which is awakened by the view of a place where any great &s;cene has been acted. I think I hear them exclaim, "Here the Federation was held! here an a&s;&s;embled nation devoted them&s;elves to freedom!" I fancy I &s;ee them pointing out the &s;pot on which the altar of the country &s;tood. I &s;ee them eagerly &s;earching for the place where they have heard it recorded, that the National A&s;&s;embly were feated! I think of the&s;e things, and then repeat to my&s;elf with tran&s;port, "<HI>I</HI> was a &s;pectator of the Federation!"</P>
<P>But the&s;e meditations have led me to travel through the &s;pace of &s;o many centuries, that it is realy difficult to get back again to the pre&s;ent
<PB N="68" REF="024003_0068_0FC2E202909C1EF8">
times. Did you expect that I &s;hould ever dip my pen in politics, who u&s;ed to take &s;o &s;mall an intere&s;t in public affairs, that I recollect a gentleman of my acquaintance &s;urpri&s;ed me not a little, by informing me of the war be|tween the Turks and the Ru&s;&s;ians, at a time when all the people of Europe, except my&s;elf, had been two years in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this intelli|gence?</P>
<P>If, however, my love of the French revolu|tion requires an apology, you &s;hall receive one in a very &s;hort time; for I am going to Mon&s;. du F&mdash;'s chateau, and will &s;end you from thence the hi&s;tory of his misfortunes. They were the inflictions of tyranny, and you will rejoice with me that tyranny is no more.</P>
<P>Before I clo&s;e my letter, I &s;hall mention a &s;ingular privilege of the church of Rouen, which is the power of &s;etting free a murderer every year on the day of A&s;cen&s;ion. It &s;eems that in the time of King Dagobert, who reign|ed in the &s;ixth century, a horrible and unre|lenting dragon de&s;olated the country, &s;paring neither man nor bea&s;t. St. Romain, who was then Bi&s;hop of Rouen, a&s;ked for two criminals to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in an enterpri&s;e he had the courage to meditate again&s;t the dragon; and with the&s;e aides de camp he &s;allied forth, killed the mon|&s;ter, and delivered the country. In con&s;e|quence of this miracle, Dagobert gave the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors of St. Romain the privilege of &s;etting a murderer free every year on A&s;cen&s;ion-day. The bones of St. Romain are carried by the
<PB N="69" REF="024003_0069_0FC2E2041944FE80">
criminal in a gilt box through the &s;treets; the figure of a hideous animal repre&s;enting the drag|on, though it is &s;u&s;pected of doing inju&s;tice to his appearance, accompanies the&s;e venerable bones, and has generally a young living wolf placed in its mouth, except when it is <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fa&s;t-day.</NOTE> jour maigre, and then the dragon is provided with a large fi&s;h. The coun&s;ellors of the parlia|ment, dre&s;&s;ed in their &s;carlet robes, attend this proce&s;&s;ion to a church, where high ma&s;s is &s;aid, and, the&s;e ceremonies being performed, the criminal is &s;et at liberty. But it is only when there are &s;ome &s;trong alleviating circum&s;tances in the ca&s;e of the offender, that he is &s;uffered in this manner to evade the puni&s;hment of his crimes.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday, in a little town called Sotte Ville, joined to Rouen by the bridge, a political di&s;|pute aro&s;e between the Cur&eacute; and his pari&s;hioners. The enraged Cur&eacute; exclaimed, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">You are an A&s;&s;embly of A&s;&s;es.</NOTE>"Vous &eacute;tes une a&s;&s;embl&eacute;e d'&acirc;nes."

<P>I HEARD <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The military ma&s;s.</NOTE> La me&s;&s;&eacute; militaire, on Sunday la&s;t, at a church where all the national guard of Rouen attended. The &s;ervice began with the loude&s;t thunder of drums and trump|ets, and &s;eemed more like a &s;ignal for battle than for devotion; but the mu&s;ic &s;oon &s;oftened into the mo&s;t &s;oothing &s;ounds which flowed from the organ, clarinets, flutes, and hautboys; the prie&s;ts chanted, and the people made re|&s;pon&s;es. The wax tapers were lighted, holy water was &s;prinkled on the ground, incen&s;e was burnt at the altar, and the elevation of the ho&s;t was announced by the &s;ound of the drum; upon which the people knelt down, and the prie&s;t pro&s;trated his face towards the earth.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething affecting in the pomp and &s;olemnity of the&s;e ceremonies.

I have more than once heard the &s;ervice for the dead performed, and never can hear it without emotion; without feeling that in tho&s;e melancholy &s;eparations, which bury every hope of the &s;urvivor in the relentle&s;s grave, the heart that can delude it&s;elf with the belief, that its prayers may avail any thing to the departed object of its affections, mu&s;t find

con&s;olation in thus uniting a tribute of tender|ne&s;s, with the performance of a religious duty.</P>
<P>We have been at &s;everal convents at Rouen. The fir&s;t to which we went was a convent of Benedictine Nuns. When we had entered the gates we rang a bell, and a &s;ervant appeared, and de&s;ired us to go up &s;tairs to the parloir. We opened a wrong door, and found, in a room grated acro&s;s the middle with iron bars, a young man &s;itting on one &s;ide of the grate, and a young nun on the other. I could not help thinking that the heart of this young man was placed in a perilous &s;ituation; for where can a young woman appear &s;o intere&s;ting, as when &s;een within that gloomy barrier, which death alone can remove? What is there, in all the o&s;tentation of female dre&s;s, &s;o likely to af|fect a man of &s;en&s;ibility, as that di&s;mal habit which &s;eems &s;o much at variance with youth and beauty, and is worn as the melancholy &s;ym|bol of an eternal renunciation of the world and all its plea&s;ures? We made an apology to the nun for our intru&s;ion, and &s;he directed us to another apartment, where, a few minutes after we had &s;eated our&s;elves on one &s;ide of the grate, La Depo&s;itaire entered on the other, and told us that the Abbe&s;s, whom we had de&s;ired to &s;ee, was not yet ri&s;en from dinner, and La De&s;po&s;i|taire hoped we would wait a little. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Becau&s;e, &s;aid &s;he, the Abbe&s;s was obliged to ri&s;e from table very &s;oon ye&s;terday, and &s;ound her&s;elf a little indi&s;po&s;ed.</NOTE> "Parce|que,"
<PB N="72" REF="024003_0072_0FC2E216D4026BD8">
&s;aid &s;he, "Madame l'Abbe&s;&s;e etoit obli|g&eacute;e hier de &s;e lever de table de bonne heure, et elle &s;e trouvoit une peu incommod&eacute;e." You mu&s;t ob&s;erve that the Abbe&s;&s;e dined at three o'clock, and it was now pa&s;t &s;ix. At length this lady, who was &s;o fond of long din|ners, appeared. She is a woman of fifty, but is &s;till hand&s;ome; has a frank agreeable coun|tenance, fine eyes, and had put on her veil in a very becoming manner. We wi&s;hed to be admitted to the interior part of the convent, and with this view a French gentleman, who was of out party, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Told a great many tales to the Abbe&s;s.</NOTE> "&s;e mit &agrave; conter des hi&s;|tories &agrave; Madame l'Abbe&s;&s;e."</P>
<P>He told her that my &s;i&s;ter and I, though Engli&s;h women, were catholics, and wi&s;hed to be received into the convent, and even, if it had been po&s;&s;ible, to take the vows. The Abbe&s;s enquired if he was quite &s;ure of our being catholics; upon which the gentleman, a little puzzled what to an&s;wer, in&s;inuated that Mon&s;. du F&mdash; had probably the merit of our conver&s;ion. "But I have heard," &s;aid the Ab|be&s;s, from Madame &mdash;, "that Mon&s;. du F&mdash; has become a prote&s;tant him&s;elf." Mon&s;. du F&mdash;, who is truth it&s;elf, avowed his princi|ples without he&s;itation; while the Abbe&s;s, turning to La Depo&s;itaire, exclaimed, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">How amiable he is! what noble &s;entiments! Ah, Sir, you are too good for God to leave you in error.</NOTE> "Mais

"St Augu&s;|tin," continued &s;he, "had once &s;ome doubts; I hope you will be a &s;econd St. Augu&s;tin; my|&s;elf, and all my community, will pray for your conver&s;ion." La Depo&s;itaire, who was a tall thin old woman, with a &s;harp malignant coun|tenance, added, ca&s;ting a look on Mon&s;. du F&mdash; full of the contempt of &s;uperior knowl|edge, "It is not &s;urpri&s;ing that a young man&punc; after pa&s;&s;ing &s;everal years in England, that country of heretics, &s;hould find his faith &s;ome|what &s;haken; but he only wants to be enlight|ened by Mon&s;. le Cur&eacute; de &mdash;, who will immediately di&s;&s;ipate all his doubts."</P>
<P>From the Convent of the Benedictines we went to that of the Carmelites, where religion, which was meant to be a &s;ource of happine&s;s in this world, as well as in the next, wears an a&s;pect of the mo&s;t gloomy horror. When we entered the convent, it &s;eemed the re&s;idence of &s;ilence and &s;olitude; no voice was heard, no human creature appeared, and when we rang the bell, a per&s;on, whom we could not &s;ee, en|quired, through a hole in the wall, what we wanted. On being informed that we wi&s;hed to &s;peak to the Superieure, putting her hand through the hole, &s;he gave us a key, and de&s;ired us to unlock the door of the parloir. This we accordingly did; and in a few minutes the Su|perieure came to a thick double grate, with a curtain drawn at the in&s;ide, to prevent the po&s;|&s;ibility
<PB N="74" REF="024003_0074_0FC2E2247B37B2D0">
of being &s;een. Our French gentleman again talked of our de&s;ire to enter the convent, and begged to know the rules. A hollow voice an&s;wered, that the Carmelites ro&s;e at four in the morning in &s;ummer and five in the win|ter:&mdash;"Obedient &s;lumbers, that can wake and weep!"&mdash;That they &s;lept in their coffins, upon &s;traw, and every morning dug a &s;hovel full of earth for their graves; that they walked to their devotional exerci&s;es upon their knees; that when any of their friends vi&s;ited them, if they &s;poke, they were not &s;uffered to be &s;een, or if they were &s;een, they were not &s;uffered to &s;peak; that with them it was <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Always a fa&s;t.</NOTE> toujours maigre, and they only ta&s;ted food twice a day.</P>
<P>Our Frenchman &s;aid, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The&s;e young ladies, Madam, mu&s;t con&s;ider whether the&s;e regulations will &s;uit them.</NOTE>"Il faut Madame que ces demoi&s;elles reflechi&s;&s;ent, &s;i cela leurs con|vient." The poor Carmelite agreed that the matter required &s;ome reflection, and we de|parted.</P>
<P>As we returned home meditating on the lot of a Carmelite, we met in the &s;treet three nuns walking in the habit of their order. Upon en|quiry, we were told that they had been forced by their parents to take the veil, and, &s;ince the decree of the National A&s;&s;embly giving them liberty, they had obtained permi&s;&s;ion to pay a vi&s;it for three months to &s;ome friends who &s;ympathized in their unhappine&s;s, and were now on their journey.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="024003_0075_0FC2E2295CB09AC0">The monks and nuns mu&s;t in a &s;hort time decide whether they will finally leave their cloi&s;ters or not; and the religious hou&s;es which are vacated will be fold. In the department of Rouen a calculation has been made, that, after paying every monk &s;even hundred, and every nun five hundred livres a year, out of the revenues of the religious hou&s;es, the depart|ment will gain &s;ixty thou&s;and livres a year. The monks and nuns above &s;ixty years of age, who choo&s;e to leave their convents, will be allowed an annual pen&s;ion of nine hundred li|vres.</P>
<P>A letter was read in the National A&s;&s;embly, a few days ago, from a prie&s;t, intreating that the clergy might have permi&s;&s;ion to marry; a privilege which it is thought the A&s;&s;embly will &s;oon authorize. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">They have overturned every thing.</NOTE> "On a boulever&s;&eacute; tout," &s;aid an old Cur&eacute;, a fierce Ari&s;tocrate, with whom I was in company, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">And would even carry the profanation &s;o far as to &s;uffer the prie&s;ts to marry.</NOTE> "Et meme on veut porter la profanation &s;i loin que de marier les pre|tres."

<P>We arrived la&s;t night at Mon&s;. du F&mdash;'s chateau, without having vi&s;ited, during our &s;tay at Rouen, the tomb of William the Conquer|or, who is buried at Caen, a town twelve leagues di&s;tant. But I have been too lately

<P>I EMBRACE the fir&s;t hours of lei&s;ure, which I have found &s;ince my arrival at the chateau, to &s;end you the hi&s;tory of my friends.</P>
<P>Antoine Augu&s;tin Thom&aacute;s du F&mdash;, eld|e&s;t &s;on of the Baron du F&mdash;, Coun&s;ellor of the Parliament of Normandy, was born on the fifteenth of July, 1750. His early years were embittered by the &s;everity of his father, who was of a di&s;po&s;ition that prefered the exerci&s;e of dome&s;tic tyranny to the ble&s;&s;ings of &s;ocial happine&s;s, and cho&s;e rather to be dreaded than beloved. The endearing name of father con|veyed no tran&s;port to <HI>his</HI> heart, which, being wrapt up in &s;tern in&s;en&s;ibility was cold even to the common feelings of nature.</P>
<P>The Baron's au&s;terity was not indeed con|fined to his &s;on, but extended to all his depend|ants. Formed by nature for the &s;upport of the ancient government of France, he maintained his ari&s;tocratic rights with unrelenting &s;everity, ruled his feudal tenures with a rod of iron, and con&s;idered the lower order of people as a &s;et of beings who&s;e exi&s;tence was tolerated merely for the u&s;e of the nobility. The poor, he be|lieved&punc; were only born for &s;uffering; and he determined, as far as in him lay, not to deprive them of their natural inheritance. On the whole, the Baron acted as if it were the great
<PB N="78" REF="024003_0078_0FC2E22D47709A20">
purpo&s;e of human life to be hated, and perhaps no per&s;on ever attained that end more com|pletely than him&s;elf.</P>
<P>His &s;on di&s;covered early a ta&s;te for literature, and received an education &s;uitable to his rank and fortune. As he advanced in life, the treatment he experienced from his father be|came more and more intolerable to him, as, far from inheriting the &s;ame character, he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t amiable di&s;po&s;itions, and the mo&s;t feeling heart.</P>
<P>His mother, feeble alike in mind and body, &s;ubmitted with the helple&s;&s;ne&s;s, and almo&s;t with the thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s of a child, to the im|perious will of her hu&s;band. Their family was increa&s;ed by two more &s;ons, and two daughters; but the&s;e children, being &s;everal years younger than Mon&s;. du F&mdash;, were not of an age to afford him the con&s;olations of friend&s;hip; and the young man would have found his &s;ituation intolerable, but for the &s;ym|pathy of a per&s;on, in who&s;e &s;ociety every evil was forgotten.</P>
<P>This per&s;on, his attachment to whom has tinctured the colour of his life, was the younge&s;t of eight children, of a re&s;pectable family of Bourgeois at Rouen. There is great rea&s;on to believe that her father was de|&s;cended from the younger branch of a noble family of the &s;ame name, and bearing the &s;ame arms. But, unhappily, &s;ome links were w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ting in this chain of honourable parent|age. The claim to nobility could not be tra|ced

to the entire &s;atisfaction of the Baron; who, though he would have di&s;pen&s;ed with any moral qualities in favour of rank, con&s;idered ob&s;cure birth as a radical &s;tain, which could not be wiped off by all the virtues under heav|en. He looked upon marriage as merely a convention of intere&s;t, and children as a prop|erty, of which it was rea&s;onable for parents to make the mo&s;t in their power.</P>
<P>The father of Mad^&s;^e^i^l^e Monique C&mdash; was a farmer, and died three months before the birth of this child; who, with &s;even other children, was educated with the utmo&s;t care by their mother, a woman of &s;en&s;e and virtue, beloved by all to whom &s;he was known. It &s;eemed as if this re&s;pectable woman had, after the death of her hu&s;band, only &s;upported life for the &s;ake of her infant family, from whom &s;he was &s;natched by death, the moment her maternal cares became no longer nece&s;&s;ary; her younge&s;t daughter, Monique, having, at this period, ju&s;t attained her twentieth year. Upon the death of her mother, Monique went to live with an aunt, with whom &s;he remained only a very &s;hort time, being invited by Mad|ame du F&mdash;, to whom &s;he was well known, to come and live with her as an humble com|panion, to read to her when &s;he was di&s;po&s;ed to li&s;ten, and to enliven the &s;ullen grandeur of the chateau, by her animating vivacity.</P>
<P>This young per&s;on had cultivated her excel|lent under&s;tanding by reading, and her heart &s;tood in no need of cultivation. Mon&s;. du

F&mdash;found in the charms of her conver&s;a|tion, and in the &s;ympathy of her friend&s;hip, the mo&s;t &s;oothing con&s;olation under the rigour of parental tyranny. Living &s;everal years beneath the &s;ame roof, he had con&s;tant opportunities of ob&s;erving her di&s;po&s;ition and character, and the pa&s;&s;ion with which &s;he at length in&s;pired him, was founded on the la&s;ting ba&s;is of e&s;|teem.</P>
<P>If it was ever pardonable to deviate from that law, in the code of intere&s;t and etiquette, which forbids the heart to li&s;ten to its be&s;t emo|tions; which, &s;tifling every generous &s;entiment of pure di&s;intere&s;ted attachment, &s;acrifices love at the &s;hrine of avarice or ambition; the vir|tues of Monique were &s;uch as might excu&s;e this deviation. Yes, the character, the conduct of this amiable per&s;on, have nobly ju&s;tified her lover's choice. How long might he have vainly &s;ought, in the highe&s;t cla&s;&s;es of &s;ociety&punc; a mind &s;o elevated above the common ma&s;s!&mdash; a mind that, endowed with the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility, has had &s;ufficient firmne&s;s to &s;u&s;tain, with a calm and equal &s;pirit, every tran&s;ition of fortune; the mo&s;t &s;evere trials of adver&s;ity, and perhaps what is &s;till more difficult to bear, the trial of high pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. du F&mdash;had been taught, by his early misfortunes, that dome&s;tic happine&s;s was the fir&s;t good of life. He had already found, by experience, the in&s;ufficiency of rank and fortune to confer enjoyment; and he deter+mined to &s;eek it in the bo&s;om of conjugal fe+licity.
<PB N="81" REF="024003_0081_0FC2E23F5C180058">
He determined to pa&s;s his life with her who&s;e &s;ociety now &s;eemed e&s;&s;ential not only to his happine&s;s, but to his very exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>At the &s;olemn hour of midnight, the young couple went to a church, where they were met by a prie&s;t whom Mon&s;. du F&mdash; had made the confident of his attachment, and by whom the marriage ceremony was performed.</P>
<P>Some time after, when the &s;ituation of his wife obliged Mon&s;. du F&mdash; to acknowledge their marriage to his mother, &s;he a&s;&s;ured her &s;on that &s;he would willingly con&s;ent to receive his wife as her daughter, but for the dread of his father's re&s;entment. Madame du F&mdash;, with tears of regret, parted with Monique, whom &s;he placed under the protection of her brothers; they conducted her to Caen, where &s;he was &s;oon after delivered of a &s;on.</P>
<P>The Baron du F&mdash; was ab&s;ent while the&s;e things were pa&s;&s;ing; he had been &s;u&s;pected of being the author of a pamphlet written again&s;t the princes of the blood, and an order was i&s;&s;u|ed to &s;eize his papers, and conduct him to the Ba&s;tile; but he found means to e&s;cape into Holland, where he remained nearly two years. Having made his peace with the mini&s;try, he prepared to come home; but before he return|ed, Mon&s;. du F&mdash; received intelligence that his father, irritated almo&s;t to madne&s;s by the information of his marriage, was making appli|cation for a le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">e de cachet, in order to confine his daughter-in-law for the re&s;t of her life; and had al&s;o obtained power to have his &s;on &s;eized

and impri&s;oned. Upon this Mon&s;. du F&mdash; and his wife fled with precipitaton to Geneva, leaving their infant at nur&s;e near Caen. The Genevois &s;eemed to think that the unfortunate &s;ituation of the&s;e &s;trangers, gave them a claim to all the offices of friend&s;hip. After an inter|val of many years, I have never heard Mon&s;. or Madame du F&mdash; recall the kindne&s;s they received from that amiable people, without tears of tenderne&s;s and gratitude.</P>
<P>Meanwhile the Baron, having di&s;covered the place of his &s;on's retreat, obtained, in the name of the King, permi&s;&s;ion from the cantons of Berne and Friburg to arre&s;t them at Echa|lans, near Laufanne, where they had retired for &s;ome months. The wife of Le Seigneur Bail|liff &s;ecretly gave the young people notice of this de&s;ign, and on the twenty-eighth of Febru|ary, 1775, they had ju&s;t time to make their e&s;|cape, with only a few livres in their pockets, and the clothes in which they were dre&s;&s;ed. Mon&s;. du F&mdash;, upon his fir&s;t going to Swit|zerland, had lent thirty louis to a friend in di&s;|tre&s;s. He now, in this moment of nece&s;&s;ity, de&s;ired to be repaid, and was promi&s;ed the money within a month; mean time, he and his wife wandered from town to town, without finding any place where they could remain in &s;ecurity. They had &s;pent all their &s;mall &s;tock of money, and were almo&s;t without clothes; but at the expiration of the appointed time, the thirty louis were paid, and with this fund Mon&s;. and madame du F&mdash; determined to take &s;helt|er

<P>They embarked at Rotterdam, and, after a long and gloomy pa&s;&s;age, arrived late at night at London. A young man who was their fel|low pa&s;&s;enger, had the charity to procure them a lodging in a garret, and directed them where to purcha&s;e a few ready made clothes. When they had remained in this lodging the time nece&s;&s;ary for becoming pari&s;hioners, their banns were publi&s;hed in the church of St. Anne, We&s;tmin&s;ter, where they were married by the Curate of the pari&s;h. They then went to the chapel of the French Amba&s;&s;ador, and were again married by his chaplain; after which Mon&s;. du F&mdash; told me, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The new-married couple kept a fa&s;t in their little apartment.</NOTE> "Les deux epoux vinrent faire maigre ch&egrave;re &agrave; leur petite chambre."</P>
<P>Mon&s;. du F&mdash; endeavoured to obtain a &s;it|uation at a &s;chool, to teach the French lan|guage; but before &s;uch a &s;ituation could be found, his wife was delivered of a girl. Not having &s;ufficient money to hire a nur&s;e he at|tended her him&s;elf. At this period they endur|ed all the horrors of ab&s;olute want.

<P>Mon&s;. and Madame du F&mdash; were relieved from this extremity of di&s;tre&s;s, at a moment &s;o critical, and by means &s;o unexpected, that it &s;eemed the hand of heaven vi&s;ibly interpo&s;ing in behalf of oppre&s;&s;ed virtue. Early in the morning of that fatal day when they were to leave their la&s;t &s;ad &s;helter, Mon&s;. du F&mdash; went out, and, in the utmo&s;t di&s;traction of mind, wandered through &s;ome of the &s;treets in the neighbourhood.

Heaven, and then, ha&s;tening to his wife and child, bade them live a little longer.</P>
<P>A &s;hort time after, he obtained a &s;ituation as French u&s;her at a &s;chool; and Madame du F&mdash;, when &s;he had a little recovered her &s;trength, put her infant out to nur&s;e, and procured the place of French teacher at a boarding-&s;chool. They were now enabled to &s;upport their child, and re|pay the generous a&s;&s;i&s;tance of their kind friend at Geneva. At this period they heard of the death of their &s;on, whom they had left at Caen.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. and Madame du F&mdash;pa&s;&s;ed two years in this &s;ituation, when they were again plunged into the deepe&s;t di&s;tre&s;s. A French jeweller was commi&s;&s;ioned by the Baron du F&mdash;, to go to his &s;on, and propo&s;e to him conditions of reconciliation. This man told Mon&s;. du F&mdash; that his father was ju&s;t recovered from a &s;evere and dangerous illne&s;s, and that his elde&s;t daughter had lately died. The&s;e things, he &s;aid, had led him to reflect with &s;ome pain on the &s;everity he had exerci&s;ed towards his &s;on; that the feelings of a parent were awak|ened in his bo&s;om; and that if Mon&s;. du F&mdash; would throw him&s;elf at his father's feet, and a&s;k forgivene&s;s, he would not fail to obtain it, and would be allowed a pen&s;ion, on which he might live with his wife in England. In con|firmation of the&s;e a&s;&s;urances, this man pro+duced &s;everal letters which he had received from the Baron to that effect; who, as a far|ther proof of his &s;incerity, had given this agent &s;even hundred pounds to put into the hands of
<PB N="87" REF="024003_0087_0FC2E258C5ECC110">
Mon&s;. du F&mdash; for the &s;upport of his wife and child during his ab&s;ence. The agent told him, that he had not been able to bring the money to England, but would immediately give him three drafts upon a merchant of rep|utation in London, with whom he had con|nexions in bu&s;ine&s;s; the fir&s;t draft payable in three months, the &s;econd in &s;ix, and the third in nine.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. du F&mdash;long deliberated upon the&s;e propo&s;als. He knew too well the vindictive &s;pirit of his father, not to feel &s;ome dread of putting him&s;elf into his power. But his agent continued to give him the mo&s;t &s;olemn a&s;&s;ur|ances of &s;afety; and Mon&s;. du F&mdash; thought it was not improbable that his &s;i&s;ter's death might have &s;oftened the mind of his father. He reflected that his marriage had di&s;appointed tho&s;e ambitious hopes of a great alliance, which his father had fondly indulged, and to whom he owed at lea&s;t the reparation of ha&s;|tening to implore his forgivene&s;s when he was willing to be&s;tow it. What al&s;o weighed &s;trongly on his mind was the con&s;ideration that the &s;um which his father had offered to depo&s;it for the u&s;e of his wife, would, in ca&s;e any &s;ini&s;|ter accident &s;hould befal him, afford a &s;mall provi&s;ion for her and his infant.</P>
<P>The re&s;ult of the&s;e deliberations was, that Mon&s;. du F&mdash; determined (and who can much blame his want of prudence?) he deter|mined to confide in a father!&mdash;to tru&s;t in that in&s;tinctive affection, which, far from being
<PB N="88" REF="024003_0088_0FC2E25D429F1CB0">
connected with any peculiar &s;en&s;ibility of mind, it requires only to be a parent to feel&mdash;an af|fection, which, not confined to the human heart, &s;oftens the ferociou&s;ne&s;s of the tyger, and &s;peaks with a voice that is heard amid&s;t the howlings of the de&s;ert.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. du F&mdash;, after the repeated promi&s;es of his father, almo&s;t con&s;idered that &s;u&s;picion which &s;till hung upon his mind, as a crime. But, le&s;t it might be po&s;&s;ible that this agent was commi&s;&s;ioned to deceive him, he endeav|oured to melt him into compa&s;&s;ion for his &s;it|uation. He went to the village where his child was at nur&s;e, and, bringing her &s;ix miles in his arms, pre&s;ented her to this man, telling him, that the fate of that poor infant re&s;ted upon his integrity. The man took the inno|cent creature in his arms, ki&s;&s;ed her, and then, returning her to her father, renewed all his former a&s;&s;urances. Mon&s;. du F&mdash; li&s;tened and believed. Alas! how difficult is it for a good heart to &s;u&s;pect human nature of crimes which make one blu&s;h for the &s;pecies! How hard is it for a mind glowing with benevolence to believe that the bo&s;om of another harbours the malignity of a demon!</P>
<P>Mon&s;. du F&mdash; now fixed the time for his departure with his father's agent, who was to accompany him to Normandy. Madame du F&mdash; &s;aw the preparations for his journey with angui&s;h which &s;he could ill conceal. But &s;he felt that the delicacy of her &s;ituation forbad her interference. It was &s;he who had made
<PB N="89" REF="024003_0089_0FC2E26100B79030">
him an alien from his family, and an exile from his country. It was for her, that, re|nouncing rank, fortune, friends, and connex|ions, all that is e&s;teemed mo&s;t valuable in life, he had &s;uffered the la&s;t extremity of want, and now &s;ubmitted to a &s;tate of drudgery and de|pendance. Would he not have a right to reproach her weakne&s;s, if &s;he attempted to op|po&s;e his reconciliation with his father, and ex|erted that influence which &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed over his mind, in order to detain him in a &s;ituation &s;o remote from his former expectations? She was, therefore, &s;en&s;ible, that the duty, the grat|itude &s;he owed her hu&s;band, now required on her part the ab&s;olute &s;acrifice of her own feel|ings; &s;he &s;uffered without complaint, and en|deavoured to re&s;ign her&s;elf to the will of Heav|en.</P>
<P>The day before his departure, Mon&s;. du F&mdash; went to take leave of his little girl. At this moment a dark and melancholy pre&s;age &s;eem|ed to agitate his mind. He pre&s;&s;ed the child for a long while to his bo&s;om, and bathed it with his tears. The nur&s;e eagerly enquired what was the matter, and a&s;&s;ured him that the child was perfectly well. Mon&s;. du F&mdash; had no power to reply; he continued cla&s;ping his in|fant in his arms, and at length, tearing him&s;elf from her in &s;ilence he ru&s;hed out of the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>When the morning of his departure came, Madame du F&mdash;, addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to his fellow traveller, &s;aid to him with a voice of &s;upplication, "I entru&s;t you, Sir, with my hu&s;|band,

The man, ca&s;ting upon her a gloomy look, gave her a cold an&s;wer, which made her &s;oul &s;hrink with|in her. When Mon&s;. du F&mdash; got into the Brighthelm&s;tone &s;tage, he was unable to bid her farewell; but when the carriage drove off, he put his head out of the window, and continued looking after her, while &s;he fixed her eyes on him, and might have repeated with Imogen,
<Q><L>I would have broke mine eye-&s;trings;</L>
<L>Crack'd them, but to look upon him, till the diminution</L>

<L>The &s;mallne&s;s of a gnat to air; and then&mdash;</L>
<L>Then turn'd mine eye and wept!</L></Q>
When the carriage was out of &s;ight, &s;he &s;um|moned all her &s;trength, and walked with tremb|ling &s;teps to the &s;chool where &s;he lived as a teacher. With much difficulty &s;he reached the door; but her limbs could &s;upport her no longer, and &s;he fell down &s;en&s;ele&s;s at the thre&s;h|old.

<HEAD>LETTER XVIII.</HEAD>
<P>MONS. du F&mdash; arrived at his fath|er's chatteau in Normandy, in June, 1778, and was received by the Baron, and all his family, with the mo&s;t affectionate cordiality. In much exultation of mind, he di&s;patched a letter to Madame du F&mdash;, containing this agreeable intelligence; but his letter was far from pro|ducing in her mind the effect he de&s;ired. A deep melancholy had &s;eized her thoughts, and her foreboding heart refu&s;ed to &s;ympathize in his joy. Short, indeed, was its duration. He had not been many days at the chateau, when he perceived, with &s;urpri&s;e and con&s;ternation, that his &s;teps were continually watched by two &s;ervants armed with fu&s;ees.</P>
<P>His father now &s;hewed him an arret, which, on the fourth of June, 1776, he had obtained from the parliament of Rouen again&s;t his mar|riage. The Baron then ordered his &s;on to ac|company him to his hou&s;e at Rouen, whither they went, attended by &s;everal &s;ervants. That evening, when the attendants withdrew after &s;upper, the Baron, entirely throwing off the ma&s;k of civility and kindne&s;s, which he had worn in &s;uch oppo&s;ition to his nature, reproach|ed his &s;on, in terms of the utmo&s;t bitterne&s;s, for his pa&s;t conduct, inveighed again&s;t his mar|riage, and, after having exau&s;ted every expre&s;|&s;ion
<PB N="92" REF="024003_0092_0FC2E27009C2CF50">
of rage and re&s;entment, at length &s;uffered him to retire to his own apartment.</P>
<P>There the unhappy Mon&s;. du F&mdash;, ab&s;orb|ed in the mo&s;t gloomy reflections, lamented in vain that fatal credulity which had led him to put him&s;elf into the power of his implacable father. At the hour of midnight his medita|tions were interrupted by the &s;ound of feet ap|proaching his chamber; and in a few moments the door was thrown open, and his father, at|tended by a &s;ervant armed, and two <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> Ju&s;tice.</NOTE> Cavaliers de Marechau&s;&s;&eacute;e, entered the room. Re&s;i&s;t|ance and &s;upplication were alike unavailing. Mon&s;. du F&mdash;'s papers were &s;eized; a few louis d'ors, which con&s;tituted all the money he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed were taken from him; and he was conducted in the dead of night, July 7th, 1778, to St. Yon, a convent u&s;ed as a place of con|finement near Rouen, where he was thrown into a dungeon.</P>
<P>A week after, his father entered the dungeon. You will perhaps conclude that his hard heart felt at length the relentings of a parent. You will at lea&s;t &s;uppo&s;e, that his imagination being haunted, and his con&s;cience tormented with the image of a &s;on &s;tretched on the floor of this &s;ubterraneous cell, he could &s;upport the idea no longer, and had ha&s;tened to give repo&s;e to his own mind by relea&s;ing his captive. Far different were the motives of his vi&s;it. He con&s;idered that &s;uch was his &s;on's attachment to his wi&s;e, that, &s;o long as he believed he had

Nor did he choo&s;e to yield to another the office of inflicting a pang &s;harper than captivity; but him&s;elf informed his &s;on, that the merchant, who was to pay the &s;even hundred pounds to his wife, was declared a bankrupt.</P>
<P>A &s;hort time after, the Baron du F&mdash; com|menced a &s;uit at law again&s;t that agent of ini|quity whom he had employed to deceive his &s;on, and who, practi&s;ing a refinement of treach|ery of which the Baron was not aware, had kept the &s;even hundred pounds, with which he was intru&s;ted, and given drafts upon a mer|chant who he knew would fail before the time of payment. Not being able to pro&s;ecute this affair without a power of attorney from his &s;on; the Baron applied to him for that purpo&s;e. But Mon&s;. du F&mdash;, being firmly re&s;olved not to deprive his wife of the chance of recov|ering the money for her&s;elf and her child, could by no intreaties or menaces be led to comply.

&s;ympathy from any one of his family, though his &s;econd brother, Mon&s;. de B&mdash;, was now eighteen years of age; an age at which the &s;ordid con&s;iderations of intere&s;t, how much &s;oever they may affect our conduct at a more advanced period of life, can &s;eldom &s;tifle tho&s;e warm and generous feelings which &s;eem to be|long to youth.

Even admitting that his inexorable father prohibited his vi&s;it|ing the pri&s;on of his brother, his heart &s;hould have told him that di&s;obedience, in this in|&s;tance, would have been virtue: Or, was it not &s;ufficient to remain a pa&s;&s;ive &s;pectator of inju&s;tice, without becoming, as he afterwards did, the agent of cruelty inflicted on a broth|er?</P>
<P>Where are the words that can convey an ade|quate idea of the &s;ufferings of Madame du F&mdash; during this period? Three weeks after her hu&s;|band's departure from England, &s;he heard the gen|eral report of the town of Rouen that the Baron du F&mdash; had obtained a letter de cachet again&s;t his &s;on, and thrown him into pri&s;on. This was all &s;he heard of her hu&s;band for the &s;pace of two years. Ignorant of the place of his confinement, uncertain if he &s;till lived, perhaps her mi&s;eries were even more poignant than his. In the di&s;mal &s;olitude of a pri&s;on, his pains
<PB N="95" REF="024003_0095_0FC2E28087057470">
were alleviated by the &s;oothing reflection that he &s;uffered for her he loved; while that very idea was to her the mo&s;t bitter aggravation of di&s;|tre&s;s. Her days pa&s;&s;ed in angui&s;h, which can only be conceived where it has been felt, and her nights were di&s;turbed by the gloomy wan|derings of fancy. Sometimes &s;he &s;aw him in her dreams, chained to the floor of his dungeon, his bo&s;om bathed in blood, and his countenance disfigured by death. Sometimes &s;he &s;aw him ha&s;tening towards her, when at the moment that he was going to embrace her, they were fiercely torn a&s;under. Madame du F&mdash; was naturally of a delicate con&s;titution, and grief of mind reduced her to &s;uch a deplorable &s;tate of weakne&s;s, that it was with infinite dif|ficulty &s;he performed the duties of her &s;ituation. For her&s;elf, &s;he would have welcomed death with thankfulne&s;s; but &s;he con&s;idered that her child now depended entirely on her labours for &s;upport; and this was a motive &s;ufficient|ly powerful to prompt her to the careful pre&s;|ervation of her own life, though it had long be|come a burden. The child was three years old when her father left England; recollected him perfectly, and, whenever her mother went to vi&s;it her, u&s;ed to call with eagerne&s;s for her papa. The enquiry, in the voice of her child, of, "When &s;hall I &s;ee my dear, dear papa?" was heard by this unhappy mother with a de|gree of agony which it were a vain attempt to de&s;cribe.</P>

With the indig|nation of offended virtue he &s;purned at the&s;e in&s;ulting propo&s;itions, and endeavoured to pre|pare his mind for the endurance of perpetual captivity.</P>
<P>Nor can imagination form an idea of a &s;cene more dereadful than his pri&s;on, where he per|ceived with horror that the greate&s;t number of tho&s;e pri&s;oners who had been many years in confinement, had an appearance of frenzy in their looks, which &s;hewed that rea&s;on had been too weak for the long &s;truggle with calamity, and had at la&s;t yielded to de&s;pair. In a cell adjoining mon&s;ieur du F&mdash;'s, was an old man who had been confined nearly forty years. His grey beard hung down to his wai&s;t, and, during the day, he was chained by his neck to the wall. He was never allowed to leave his cell, and never &s;poke; but Mon&s;. du F&mdash; u&s;ed to hear the rattling of his chains.</P>
<P>The pri&s;oners, a few excepted, were gener|ally brought from their cells at the hour of
<PB N="97" REF="024003_0097_0FC2E283A8F58CC8">
noon, and dined together. But this gloomy repa&s;t was &s;erved in uninterrupted &s;ilence. They were not &s;uffered to utter one word, and the penalty of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing this rule was a rig|orous confinement of &s;everal weeks. As &s;oon as this comfortle&s;s meal was fini&s;hed, the pri&s;|oners were in&s;tantly obliged to return to their dungeons, in which they were locked up till the &s;ame hour the following day. Mon&s;. du F&mdash;, in his damp and melancholy cell, pa&s;&s;ed two winters without fire, and &s;uffered &s;o &s;e|verely from cold, that he was obliged to wrap him&s;elf up in the few clothes which covered his bed. Nor was he allowed any light, ex|cept that which during the &s;hort day beamed through the &s;mall grated window in the cieling of his dungeon.</P>
<P>Is it not difficult to believe that the&s;e &s;uffer|ings were inflicted by a father? A father!&mdash; that name which I cannot trace without emo|tion; which conveys all the ideas of protec|tion, of &s;ecurity, of tenderne&s;s;&mdash;that dear relation to which, in general, children owe their pro&s;perity, their enjoyments, and even their virtues!&mdash;Alas, the unhappy Mon&s;. du F&mdash; owed nothing to <HI>his</HI> father, but that life, which from its earlie&s;t period his cruelty had embittered, and which he now condemned to langui&s;h in mi&s;eries that death only could heal.</P>
<P>A young gentleman, who was confined in a cell on one &s;ide of Mon&s;. du F&mdash;'s contriv|ed to make a &s;mall hole through the wall;
<PB N="98" REF="024003_0098_0FC2E28DA04C91E8">
and the&s;e companions in misfortune, by plac|ing them&s;elves clo&s;e to the hole, could con|ver&s;e together in whi&s;pers. But the Monks were not long in di&s;covering this, and effectu|ally deprived them of &s;o great an indulgence, by removing them to di&s;tant cells. The&s;e unrelenting Monks, who performed with &s;uch fidelity their office of tormenting their fellow-creatures, who never relaxed in one article of per&s;ecution, and adhered with &s;crupulous rig|our to the code of cruelty, were called, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Brothers of the holy Charity.</NOTE> "Les Freres de la &s;ainte Charit&eacute;." One among them de&s;erved the appellation. This good old Monk u&s;ed to vi&s;it the pri&s;oners by &s;tealth, and endeavour to admini&s;ter comfort to their afflic|tion. Often he repeated to Mon&s;. du F&mdash;, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">My dear brother, be comforted: Place your confidence in God; your afflictions will have an end.</NOTE> "Mon cher frere, con&s;olez vous; mettez votre confiance en Dieu, vos maux &s;eront finis!"</P>
<P>Mon&s;. du F&mdash; remained two years in pri&s;|on without receiving any intelligence of his wife, on who&s;e account he &s;uffered the mo&s;t di&s;tracting anxiety. He had rea&s;on to appre|hend that her frame, which had already been enfeebled by her misfortunes, would &s;ink beneath this additional load of mi&s;ery, and that &s;he would perhaps be rendered unable to pro|cure that little pittance, which might pre&s;erve

her&s;elf and her child from want. At length one of his fellow-pri&s;oners, who was going to regain his liberty, took charge of a letter to Madame du F&mdash;, and flattered him with the hope of finding &s;ome means of tran&s;mitting to him an an&s;wer.</P>
<P>The letter paints &s;o naturally the &s;ituation of his mind, that I have tran&s;lated &s;ome extracts from it.</P>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>My thoughts (he &s;ays) are uncea&s;ingly oc|cupied about you, and my dear little girl.

How could I con&s;ent to &s;epa|rate my&s;elf from what was mo&s;t dear to me in the world? No motive le&s;s powerful than that of &s;eeking your welfare, and that of my child, could have determined me&mdash;and alas! I have not accompli&s;hed this end.

<P>What joy would a letter from you give me! but I dare not flatter my&s;elf with the hope of &s;uch &s;weet con&s;olation. All I can a&s;&s;ure my&s;elf of is, that though &s;eparated, per|haps

I find a con&s;olation in the reflection that it is for you I &s;uffer. If Providence ever permits us to meet again, that moment will efface the remem|brance of all my calamities.

Embrace her tenderly for me, and de&s;ire her al&s;o to embrace you for her poor papa. I need not recommend my child to the care of &s;o tender a mother; but I con|jure you to in&s;pire her mind with the deepe&s;t &s;en&s;e of religion. If &s;he is born to inherit the mi&s;fortunes of her father, this will be her be&s;t &s;ource of con&s;olation.</P>
<P>Whatever offers may be made you by my father, I exhort you never have the weakne&s;s to li&s;ten to them, but pre&s;erve your rights, and tho&s;e of my dear little girl, which, perhaps, may one day be of &s;ome value.

<HEAD>LETTER XX.</HEAD>
<P>YOU, my dear friend, who have felt the tender attachments of love and friend&s;hip, and the painful anxieties which ab&s;ence occa|&s;ions, even amid&s;t &s;cenes of variety and plea&s;|ure; who under&s;tand the value at which tid|ings from tho&s;e we love is computed in the arithmetic of the heart; who have heard with almo&s;t uncontrolable emotion the po&s;t-man's rap at the door; have trembling &s;een the well-known hand which excited &s;en&s;ations that almo&s;t deprived you of power to break the &s;eal which &s;eemed the tali&s;man of happine&s;s; you can judge of the feelings of Mon&s;. du F&mdash; when he received, by means of the &s;ame friend who had conveyed his letter, an an&s;wer from his wife. But the per&s;on who brought the letter to his dungeon, dreading the ri&s;k of a di&s;covery, in&s;i&s;ted, that after having read it, he &s;hould return it to him immediately. Mon&s;. du F&mdash; pre&s;&s;ed the letter to his heart, bath|ed it with his tears, and implored the indul|gence of keeping it at lea&s;t till the next morn|ing. He was allowed to do &s;o, and read it till
<PB N="102" REF="024003_0102_0FC2DC964D90D2F8">
every word was imprinted on his memory; and, after enjoying the &s;ad luxury of holding it that night on his bo&s;om, was forced the next morning to relinqui&s;h his trea&s;ure.</P>
<P>On the 10th of October, 1780, the Baron du F&mdash; came to the convent, and ordered the Monks to bring his &s;on from his dungeon to the parloir, and leave them together. With the utmo&s;t reluctance Mon&s;. du F&mdash; obeyed this &s;ummons, having long lo&s;t all hope of &s;oft|ening the obdurate heart of his father. When the Monks withdrew, the Baron began up|braiding him in the mo&s;t bitter terms, for his ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance to his will, which, he in|formed him, had availed nothing, as he had gained his &s;uit at law, and recovered the &s;even hundred pounds. Mon&s;. du F&mdash; replied, that the pain he felt from this intelligence would have been far more acute, had his wife been deprived, with his concurrence, of the money which was promi&s;ed for her &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and on the reliance of which promi&s;e he had been tempted to leave England. His father then enquired if he &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in his adher|ence to the di&s;graceful connection he had formed; to which his &s;on an&s;wered, that not merely were his affections intere&s;ted, but that his honour obliged him to maintain, with invi|olable fidelity, a &s;olemn and &s;acred engage|ment. The rage of the Baron, at the&s;e words, became unhounded. He &s;tamped the ground with his feet; he aimed a &s;troke at his &s;on, who, taking advantage of this moment of frenzy de|termined
<PB N="103" REF="024003_0103_0FC2DCA499836EE0">
to attempt his e&s;cape; and, ru&s;hing out of the apartment, and avoiding that &s;ide of the convent which the Monks inhabited, he endeavoured to find his way to the garden, but mi&s;&s;ed the pa&s;&s;age which led to it. He then flew up a &s;tairca&s;e, from which he heard the voice of his father calling for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Find|ing that all the doors which he pa&s;&s;ed were &s;hut, he continued a&s;cending till he reached the top of the builing, where meeting with no other opening than a hole made in the &s;loping roof to let in light to a garret, he climbed up with much difficulty, and then putting his feet through the hole, and letting his body out by degrees, he &s;upported him&s;elf for a moment on the roof, and deliberated on what he was about to do. But his mind was, at this cri&s;is, wrought up to a pitch of de&s;peration, which mocked the &s;ugge&s;tions of fear. He quitted his hold, and, flinging him&s;elf from a height of nearly fifty feet, became in&s;en&s;ible before he reached the ground, where he lay weltering in his blood, and to all appearance dead.</P>
<P>He had fallen on the high road leading from Rouen to Caen. Some people who were pa&s;&s;|ing gathered round him, and one per&s;on having wa&s;hed the blood from his face, in&s;tantly re|cognized his features, and exclaimed to the a&s;toni&s;hed crowd, that he was the elde&s;t &s;on of Baron du F&mdash;. Upon examining his body, it was found that he had broken his arm, his thigh, his ancle-bone, and his heel, be&s;ides hav|ing received many violent brui&s;es. He &s;till re|mained
<PB N="104" REF="024003_0104_0FC2DCA6197B1A10">
in a &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility; and while the&s;e charitable &s;trangers were u&s;ing their ef|forts to re&s;tore him to life, the Monks ha&s;tened from their convent, &s;natched their victim from tho&s;e good Samaritans who would have poured oil and wine into his wounds, and carried him to the infirmary of the convent, where he re|mained &s;ome weeks before he recovered his &s;en&s;es; after which he lay &s;tretched upon a bed for three months, &s;uffering agonies of pain.</P>
<P>His father, who had been the jailer, and al|mo&s;t the murderer of his &s;on, heard of the&s;e &s;ufferings without remor&s;e, nor did he ever &s;ee him more. But, though he was &s;ufficiently ob|durate to bear, unmoved, the calamities he had inflicted on his child, though he could check the upbraidings of his own con&s;cience, he could not &s;ilence the voice of public indignation. The report that Mon&s;. du F&mdash; had been found lying on the road bathed in blood, and had in that condition been dragged to the pri&s;on of St. Yon, was &s;oon &s;pread through the town of Rou|en. Every one &s;ympathized in the fate of this unfortunate young man, and execrated the ty|ranny of his unrelenting father.</P>
<P>The univer&s;al clamour reached the ear of his brother, Mon&s;. de B&mdash;, who now, for the fir&s;t time, out of re&s;pect to the public opinion, took a mea&s;ure which his heart had never dic|tated during the long captivity of his brother, that of vi&s;iting him in pri&s;on. Mon&s;. de B&mdash;'s de&s;ign in the&s;e vi&s;its was merely to ap|pea&s;e the public; for &s;mall indeed was the con|&s;olation
<PB N="105" REF="024003_0105_0FC2DCA798F7E820">
they afforded to his brother. He did not come to bathe with his tears the bed where that unhappy young man lay &s;tretched in pain and angui&s;h; to lament the &s;everity of his father; to offer him all the con&s;olation of fra|ternal tenderne&s;s:&mdash;He came to warn him again&s;t indulging a hope of ever regaining his liberty; he came to pierce his &s;oul "with hard unkindne&s;s' altered eye, which mocks the tear it forc'd to flow!"</P>
<P>I will not attempt to de&s;cribe the wretched|ne&s;s of Madame du F&mdash;, when &s;he heard the report of her hu&s;band's &s;ituation. Your heart will conceive what &s;he &s;uffered far better than I can relate it. Three months after his fall, Mon&s;. du F&mdash; contrived, through the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of the charitable old Monk, to &s;end her a few lines written with his left hand. "My fall" (he &s;ays) "has made my captivity known, and has led the whole town of Rouen to take an intere&s;t in my misfortunes. Perhaps I &s;hall have rea&s;on to ble&s;s the accident, which may po&s;&s;ibly prove the means of procuring me my liberty, and uniting me again to you!&mdash;In the mean time, I tru&s;t that Providence will watch with paternal goodne&s;s over the two objects of my mo&s;t tender affection. Do not, my deare&s;t wife, &s;uffer the thoughts of my &s;ituation to prey too much upon your mind. My arm is almo&s;t well; my thigh and foot are not quite cured; but I am getting better."</P>
<P>"I could not &s;uppre&s;s my tears on reading that part of your letter, wherein you tell me
<PB N="106" REF="024003_0106_0FC2DCA91FF51378">

I am well convinced that you will give her the be&s;t education your little pit|tance can afford. But above all, I be&s;eech you, in&s;pire her young mind with &s;entiments of piety; teach her to love her Creator; that is the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential of all le&s;&s;ons.

<P>It is here nece&s;&s;ary to mention, that Mon&s;. de Bel B&mdash;, Procureur General de Rouen,
<PB N="107" REF="024003_0107_0FC2DCAA89BF3570">
being intimately connected with the Baron du F&mdash;'s family, had ventured to demon&s;trate his friend&s;hip for the Baron, by confining his &s;on nearly three years on his own authority, and without any lettre de cachet.

<P>The Baron du F&mdash; perceived that, not|with&s;tanding his machinations had prevented the Parliament of Rouen from taking any ef|fectual mea&s;ures towards liberating his &s;on, it would be impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ilence the murmurs of the public, while he remained confined at St. Yon. He determined, therefore, to remove him to &s;ome di&s;tant pri&s;on, where his name and family were unknown; and where, beyond the juri&s;diction of the Parliament of Rouen, his groans might ri&s;e unpitied and unavenged. But the Baron, not daring, amid&s;t the general clamour, to remove his &s;on by force, endeav|oured to draw him artfully into the &s;nare he had prepared.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. de B&mdash; was &s;ent to his brother's pri&s;on, where he repre&s;ented to him, that, though he mu&s;t not indulge the lea&s;t hope of ever regaining his liberty, yet, if he would write a letter to Mon&s;. M&mdash;, Keeper of the Seals, de&s;iring to be removed to &s;ome other place, his confinement &s;hould be made far le&s;s rigorous. Mon&s;. du F&mdash; was now in a &s;tate of de&s;peration, that render|ed him almo&s;t carele&s;s of his fate. He per|ceived that the Parliament had renounced his cau&s;e. He &s;aw no po&s;&s;ibilty of e&s;cape from St. Yon; and flattered him&s;elf, that in a place where he was le&s;s clo&s;ely confined, it might perhaps be practicable; and therefore
<PB N="109" REF="024003_0109_0FC2DCBA4DB36A70">
he con&s;ented to write the letter required, which Mon&s;. de B&mdash; conveyed in triumph to his father. There were, however, &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions in the letter which the Baron di&s;|approved, on which account he returned it, de&s;iring that tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ions might be chang|ed. But, during the interval of his brother's ab&s;ence, Mon&s;. du F&mdash; had reflected on the ra&s;h imprudence of confiding in the promi&s;es of tho&s;e by whom he had been &s;o cruelly de|ceived. No &s;ooner, therefore, did Mon&s;. de B&mdash; put the letter again into his hands, than he tore it into pieces, and peremptorily refu&s;ed to write another.</P>
<P>Soon after this, Mon&s;. de B&mdash;, the amba&s;|&s;ador of the tyrant, again returned to his broth|er with fre&s;h credentials, and declared to him, that if he would write to the Keeper of the Seals, de&s;iring to be removed from St. Yon, he &s;hould, in one fortnight after his removal, be re&s;tored to liberty. Upon Mon&s;. du F&mdash;'s a&s;&s;erting that he could no longer confide in the promi&s;es made him by his family, his brother, in a formal written engagement, to which he &s;igned his name, gave him the mo&s;t &s;olemn a&s;|&s;urance, that this promi&s;e &s;hould be fulfilled with fidelity. Mon&s;. du F&mdash; de&s;ired a few days for deliberation, and, during that interval, found means of con&s;ulting a magi&s;trate of Rouen who was his friend, and who advi&s;ed him to comply with the terms that were offer|ed, after having cau&s;ed &s;everal copies of the written engagement to be taken, and certified
<PB N="110" REF="024003_0110_0FC2DCBBC72C8858">
by &s;uch of the pri&s;oners at St. Yon as were likely to regain their freedom; a precaution nec|e&s;&s;ary, le&s;t his own copy &s;hould be torn from his hands.</P>
<P>Thus, having neither tru&s;ted to the affection, the mercy, or the remor&s;e of tho&s;e within who&s;e bo&s;oms &s;uch &s;entiments were extingui&s;hed; having bargained, by a written agreement, with a father and a brother, for his relea&s;e from the horrors of perpetual captivity, Mon&s;. du F&mdash; wrote the letter required.</P>
<P>Soon after, an order was &s;ent from Ver&s;ailles for his relea&s;e from the pri&s;on of St. Yon, and with it a lettre de cachet, whereby he was exil|ed to Beauvais, with a command not to leave that town. Mon&s;. de B&mdash;, acting as a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An officer of ju&s;tice.</NOTE> Cavalier de la Marechau&s;&s;&eacute;e, conducted his brother to this place of exile, and there left him. A &s;hort time after, Mon&s;. du F&mdash; re|ceived an intimation, from that magi&s;trate of Rouen who had intere&s;ted him&s;elf in his mi&s;|fortunes, that his father was on the point of obtaining another lettre de cachet, to remove him from Beauvais, to &s;ome pri&s;on in the &s;outh of France, where he might never more be heard of. This gentleman added, that Mon&s;. du F&mdash; had not one moment to lo&s;e, and advi&s;ed him immediately to attempt his e&s;cape.</P>
<P>Early in the morning after he received this intelligence, Mon&s;. du F&mdash;, who had liberty to walk about the town, fled from Beauvais.
<PB N="111" REF="024003_0111_0FC2DCBD4F1C9760">
The per&s;on who brought him the letter from the magi&s;trate, waited for him at a little di&s;|tance from the town, and accompanied him on his journey. When they reached Li&s;le, in Flanders, not having a pa&s;&s;port, they were obliged to wait from eleven o'clock at night till ten the next morning, before they could obtain permi&s;&s;ion from the Governor to pro|ceed on their journey. Mon&s;. du F&mdash; con|cluded that he was pur&s;ued, and &s;uffered the mo&s;t dreadful apprehen&s;ions of being overtaken. His companion, with &s;ome addre&s;s, at length obtained a pa&s;&s;port, and attended him as far as O&s;tend. The wind proving contrary, he was detained two days in a &s;tate of the mo&s;t di&s;tract|ing inquietude, and concealed him&s;elf on board the ve&s;&s;el in which he had taken his pa&s;|&s;age for England. At length the wind became favourable; the ve&s;&s;el &s;ailed, and arrived late in the night at Margate. Mon&s;. du F&mdash;, when he reached the Engli&s;h &s;hore, knelt down, and, in a tran&s;oprt of joy, ki&s;&s;ed the earth of that dear country which had twice proved his a&s;ylum.</P>
<P>He then enquired when the &s;tage-coach &s;et off for London, and was told that it went at &s;o ear|ly an hour the next morning, that he could not go till the day after, as he mu&s;t wait till his portmanteau was examined by the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers, who were in bed. The delay of a few hours in &s;eeing his wife and child, after &s;uch an ab&s;ence, after &s;uch &s;ufferings, was not to be endured. In a violent agitation of
<PB N="112" REF="024003_0112_0FC2DCCBD67C31F0">
mind, he &s;natched up his portmanteau, and was going to fling it into the &s;ea, when he was prevented by the people near him, who &s;aid, that if he would pay the fees, his port|manteau &s;hould be &s;ent after him. He eagealy complied with their demands, and &s;et out for London. As he drew near, his anxiety, his impatience, his emotion increa&s;ed. His pre&s;|ent &s;ituation appeared to him like one of tho&s;e delicious dreams, which &s;ometimes vi&s;ited the darkne&s;s of his dungeon, and for a while re&s;tor|ed him, in imagination, to tho&s;e he loved. Scarcely could he per&s;uade him&s;elf that he was beyond the reach of oppre&s;&s;ion; that he was in a land of freedom; that he was ha&s;tening every moment towards his wife and child. When he entered London, his &s;en&s;ations became al|mo&s;t too &s;trong to bear. He was in the very &s;ame place which his wife and child inhabit|ed&mdash;but were they yet alive? were they in health? had Heaven indeed re&s;erved for him the tran&s;port of holding them once more to his bo&s;om, of mixing his tears with theirs? When he knocked at the door of the hou&s;e where he expected to hear of Madame du F&mdash;, he had &s;carcely power to articulate his enquiries after her and his child. He was told that they were in health, but that Madame du F&mdash;, being in a &s;ituation &s;ix miles from London, he could not &s;ee her till the next morning. Mon&s;. du F&mdash; had not been in a bed for &s;everal nights, and was almo&s;t overcome with agitation and fatigue. He, however, in&s;tantly &s;et out on
<PB N="113" REF="024003_0113_0FC2DCCD18086B88">
foot for the habitation of his wife, announced him&s;elf to the mi&s;tre&s;s of the family, and re|mained in another apartment, while &s;he, after making Madame du F&mdash; promi&s;e that &s;he would li&s;ten to her with calmne&s;s, told her, that there was a probability of her hu&s;band's return to England. He heard the &s;obs, the exclama|tions of his wife, at this intelligence&mdash;he could re&s;train no longer&mdash;he ru&s;hed into the room&mdash; he flew into her arms&mdash;he continued pre&s;&s;ing her in &s;ilence to his bo&s;om. She was unable to &s;hed a tear; and it was not till after he had long endeavoured to &s;ooth her by his tender|ne&s;s, and had talked to her of her child, that &s;he obtained relief from weeping. She then, with the mo&s;t violent emotion, again and again repeated the &s;ame enquiries, and was a con&s;id|erable time before &s;he recovered any degree of compo&s;ure.</P>
<P>All the fortune Mon&s;. du F&mdash; po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed when he reached London, was one half guinea; but his wife had, during his ab&s;ence, &s;aved ten guineas out of her little &s;alary. You will ea&s;ily im|agine how valuable this hoard became in her e&s;ti|mation, when &s;he could apply it to the precious u&s;e of relieving the nece&s;&s;ities of her hu&s;band. Mon&s;. du F&mdash; went to London the next day, and hired a little garret; there, with a few books, a ru&s;h light, and &s;ome &s;traw in which he wrapped his legs to &s;upply the want of fire, he recollected not the &s;plendor to which he had once been accu&s;tomed, but the dungeon from which he had e&s;caped. He &s;aw his wife
<PB N="114" REF="024003_0114_0FC2DCCE9EF1FB58">
and child once a week; and, in tho&s;e &s;olitary moments, when books failed to &s;ooth his thoughts, he anticipated the hour in which he &s;hould again meet the objects mo&s;t dear to his heart, and pa&s;&s;ed the intervals of time in phi|lo&s;ophic re&s;ignation. His clothes being too &s;habby to admit of his appearing in the day, he i&s;&s;ued from his little &s;hed when it was dark, and endeavoured to warm him&s;elf by the ex|erci&s;e of walking.</P>
<P>Unfortunately he caught the &s;mall-pox, and his di&s;order ro&s;e to &s;uch a height, that his life was de&s;paired of.

<P>SIX months after Mon&s;. du F&mdash;'s re|turn to England, his family found them&s;elves compelled to &s;ilence the public clamours, by allowing him a &s;mall annual pen&s;ion. Upon this madame du F&mdash; quitted her place, and
<PB N="115" REF="024003_0115_0FC2DCD01227E748">
came to live with her hu&s;band and child in an ob&s;cure lodging. Their little income receiv|ed &s;ome addition by means of teaching the French language in a few private families.</P>
<P>A young lady, who came to pay me a vi&s;it at London in 1785, de&s;ired to take &s;ome le&s;&s;ons in French, and Madame du F&mdash; was recom|mended to us for that purpo&s;e. We &s;oon per|ceived in her conver&s;ation every mark of a cul|tivated mind, and of an amiable di&s;po&s;ition. She at length told us the hi&s;tory of her misfor|tunes, with the pathetic eloquence of her own charming language; and, after having heard that recital, it required but common humanity, to treat her with the re&s;pect due to the unhap|py, and to feel for her &s;orrows that &s;ympathy to which they had &s;uch claim. How much has the &s;en&s;ibility of Mon&s;. and Madame du F&mdash;over-rated tho&s;e proofs of e&s;teem and friend&s;hip which we were enabled to &s;hew them in their adver&s;ity!&mdash;But I mu&s;t not antic|ipate.</P>
<P>On the &s;eventh of December, 1787, the Baron died, leaving, be&s;ides Mon&s;. du F&mdash;, two other &s;ons, and a daughter.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t here mention, that at the time when Mon&s;. du F&mdash;was confined to his bed in the pri&s;on of St. Yon; from the con&s;equences of his fall, his father, in order to avoid the clam|ours at Rouen, went for &s;ome weeks to Paris. He there made a will, di&s;inheriting his elde&s;t &s;on. By the old laws of France, however, a father could not puni&s;h his &s;on more than once
<PB N="116" REF="024003_0116_0FC2DCD1A68F0090">
for the &s;ame offence. Nor was there any thing in &s;o mild a clau&s;e that could much en|courage di&s;obedience; &s;ince this &s;ingle pun|i&s;hment, of which the mercy of the law was careful to avoid repetition, might be extend|ed to re&s;idence for life in a dungeon. Such was evidently the intention of the Baron du F&mdash;; and, though his &s;on, di&s;appointing this intention, had e&s;caped with only three years of captivity, and &s;ome broken limbs, the benignant law above mentioned interpo&s;ed to prevent farther puni&s;hment, and left the Baron without any legal right to deprive Mon&s;. du F&mdash; of his inheritance. His brothers, be|ing &s;en&s;ible of this, wrote to inform him of his father's death, and recall him to France. He refu&s;ed to go while the lettre de cachet re|mained in force again&s;t him. The Baron hav|ing left all his papers &s;ealed up, which his younger &s;ons could not open but in the pre&s;|ence of their brother, they obtained the revocation of the lettre de cachet, and &s;ent it to Mon&s;. du F&mdash;, who immediately &s;et off for France.</P>
<P>The Barons' e&s;tate amounted to about four thou&s;and pounds a year. Willing to avoid a tedious litigation with his brothers, Mon&s;. du F&mdash;con&s;ented to divide with them this prop|erty. But he &s;oon found rea&s;on to repent of his imprudent genero&s;ity; tho&s;e very brothers, on whom he had be&s;towed an equal &s;hare of his fortune, refu&s;ing to concur with him in his ap|plication to the parliament of Rouen for the
<PB N="117" REF="024003_0117_0FC2DCDFD79041D0">
revocation of the arret again&s;t his marriage. Mon&s;. du F&mdash;, &s;urpri&s;ed and &s;hocked at their refu&s;al, began to entertain &s;ome apprehen&s;ions of his per&s;onal &s;afety; and dreading that, &s;up|ported by the authority of his mother, another lettre de cachet might be obtained again&s;t him, he ha&s;tened back to England. Nor was it till after he had received a&s;&s;urances from &s;everal of the magi&s;trates of Rouen, that they would be re&s;pon&s;ible for the &s;afety of his per&s;on, that he again ventured to return to France, accompa|nied by Madame and Mademoi&s;elle du F&mdash;, in order to obtain the revocation of the arret. On their arrival at Rouen, finding that the Par|liament was exiled, and that the bu&s;ine&s;s could not be pro&s;ecuted at that time, they again came back to pa&s;s the winter in England.</P>
<P>At this period his mother died; and in the following &s;ummer Mon&s;. and Madame du F&mdash; arrived in France, at the great epoch of French liberty, on the 15th of July, 1789, the very day after that on which the Ba&s;tile was taken. It was then that Mon&s;. du F&mdash; felt him&s;elf in &s;ecurity on his native &s;hore.&mdash;It was then that his dome&s;tic comforts were no longer embitter|ed with the dread of being torn from his fami|ly by a &s;eperation more terrible than death it|&s;elf.&mdash;It was then that he no more feared that his repo&s;e at night would be broken by the entrance of ruffians prepared to drag him to dungeons, the darkne&s;s of which was never vi&s;|ited by the ble&s;&s;ed beams of day.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="024003_0118_0FC2DCE20B51C038">He immediately took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his cha|teau, and only waits for the appointment of the new Judges, to &s;olicit the revocation of the ar|ret again&s;t his marriage, and to &s;ecure the inher|itance of his e&s;tate to Mademoi&s;elle du F&mdash;&punc; his only daughter, who is now fifteen years of age, and is that very child who was born in the bo&s;om of adver&s;ity, and who&s;e infancy was ex|po&s;ed to all the mi&s;eries of want. May &s;he never know the afflictions of her parents, but may &s;he inherit their virtues!</P>
<P>Under the ancient government of France, there might have been &s;ome doubt of Mon&s;. du F&mdash;'s obtaining the revocation of the ar|ret again&s;t his marriage. Beneath the iron hand of de&s;poti&s;m, ju&s;tice and virtue might have been overthrown. But happier omens belong to the new con&s;titution of France.&mdash; The Judges will commence their high office, with that dignity becoming &s;o important a tru&s;t, by cancelling an act of the mo&s;t flagrant op|pre&s;&s;ion. They will confirm that &s;olemn, that &s;acred engagement which Mon&s;. and Madame du F&mdash; have three times vowed at the altar of God!&mdash;which has been &s;anctioned by laws human and divine&mdash;which has been ratified in earth and in heaven!</P>
<P>No &s;ooner had Mon&s;. and Madame du F&mdash; taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their property, than they &s;eemed eager to convince us, how little this change of fortune was capable of obliterating, for one moment, the remembrance of the friends of their adver&s;ity. With all the earn|e&s;tne&s;s

of affection, they invited us to France, and appeared to think, their pro&s;perity incom|plete, and their happine&s;s imperfect, till we ac|cepted the invitation. You will believe that we are not in&s;en&s;ible witne&s;&s;es of the delight|ful change in their fortune. We have the joy of &s;eeing them not only po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing all the com|forts of affluence, but univer&s;al re&s;pect and e&s;|teem.</P>

<P>Such is the hi&s;tory of Mon&s;. du F&mdash;.

would have &s;ickened at the &s;ight of general happine&s;s. The idea of liberty being extend|ed to the lower ranks, while, at the &s;ame time, tyranny was deprived of its privileges, he would have found in&s;upportable; and would have ab|horred a country, which could no longer boa&s;t of a Ba&s;tile, a country where iron cages were broken down, where dungeons were thrown open, and where ju&s;tice was henceforth to &s;hed a clear and &s;teady light, without one dark &s;hade of relief from lettres de cachet.</P>
<P>But peace be to his a&s;hes! If the recollection of his evil deeds excites my indignation, it is far otherwi&s;e with Mon&s;. and Madame du F&mdash;. Never did I hear their lips utter an expre&s;&s;ion of re&s;entment, or di&s;re&s;pect, towards his memory; and never did I, with that warmth which belongs to my friend&s;hip for them, pa&s;s a cen&s;ure on his conduct, without being made &s;en&s;ible, by their behaviour, that I had done wrong.</P>

<P>WE have had a f&eacute;te at the chateau, on the day of St. Augu&s;tin, who is Mon&s;. du F&mdash;'s patron; and, though Mon&s;. is become a prote&s;tant, I hope he will always &s;hew this mark of re&s;pect to his old friend St. Augu&s;tin.

<P>The ceremonies began with a di&s;charge of fu&s;&eacute;es, after which Mademo&s;eille du F&mdash; entered the &s;aloon, where a great crowd were a&s;&s;embled, with a crown of flowers in her hand, and addre&s;&s;ed her father in the&s;e words: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"My deare&s;t papa, can I choo&s;e a more fa|vorable moment to wi&s;h you an agreeable f&eacute;te than this, when our be&s;t, our faithful friends are here a&s;&s;embled, and join with me in celebrating this happy day?

<P>Apropos of poets.&mdash;The French have con|quered many old prejudices, but their prejudice again&s;t Shake&s;peare &s;till exi&s;ts. They well know, that though in England it is our policy, or our plea&s;ure, to have an oppo&s;ition on every other &s;ubject, we have not one di&s;&s;enting voice about Shake&s;peare; and therefore they allow that he may, perhaps, de&s;erve to be the idol of the Briti&s;h nation, a &s;ort of hou&s;e-hold god whom we delight to honour; but they have gods of their own to whom they pay homage, and have little idea that Shake&s;peare was not only the glory of England, but of human na|ture. It would be a hopele&s;s attempt to con|vince them, that the genius of their boa&s;ted Corneille, has &s;omething of the proud and af|fected greatne&s;s of Lewis the Fourteenth&punc; while that of Shake&s;peare has more affinity to the noble dignified &s;implicity of Henry the Fourth. They repeat, till you are weary of the remark, that French tragedies are regular dramas, while Shake&s;peare's plays are mon&s;ters. This re|minds me of Boileau's an&s;wer to an author who had brought him a play to read, of which Boi|leau di&s;approved. Sir, exclaimed the enraged author, I defy malice to &s;ay that my piece tran&s;gre&s;&s;es any one of the rules. "Why,

<P>The young gentleman who, as I mentioned to you, was confined at St. Yon, in the cell adjoining Mon&s;. du F&mdash;'s, and with whom he u&s;ed to conver&s;e in whi&s;pers through a hole in the wall, is come to pay a vi&s;it at the cha|teau. This young man went very early into the army; but, at the age of twenty, his father being at St. Domingo, and his mother con&s;id|ering her &s;on as a &s;py upon her conduct, which was &s;uch as &s;hrunk from in&s;pection, obtained a lettre de cachet again&s;t him, and he was con|fined three years at St. Yon. He has told me, that, after the fir&s;t year, he lo&s;t all hope of ever regaining his liberty. A morbid melancholy &s;eized his mind; he lay &s;tretched on the &s;ame bed for two years; and &s;ometimes refu&s;ed to ta&s;te food for &s;everal days together. When his father, at his return from St. Domingo, came to liberate him, he was &s;o feeble that he was unable to walk.</P>
<P>His father again left France, and the brother of this young man has &s;uffered a fate even more &s;evere than him&s;elf. At the age of fifteen, he was guilty of &s;ome indi&s;cretions, which incurred the re&s;entment of his unrelenting mother, and another lettre de cachet was obtained.&mdash;"Is there any cau&s;e in nature that makes the&s;e hard hearts?"&mdash;He was confined ten years, and on|ly relea&s;ed when all the pri&s;ons were thrown open, by order of the National A&s;&s;embly.

He is ready to ac|knowledge, that confinement in a &s;ubterraneous cell, a fall from a height of fifty feet, and the fracture of his limbs, are things which even the title of Baron can &s;carcely counterbalance; and he therefore drinks a libation, every day after dinner, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">To the health of the National A&s;&s;embly.</NOTE> &agrave; la &s;ante de l'A&s;&s;embl&eacute;e Nationale. though they have deprived him of the &s;oothing epithet of Mon-Seigneur.

<P>WE left France early in September, that we might avoid the equinoctial ga&s;es; but were &s;o unfortunate as to meet, in our pa&s;&s;age from Dieppe to Brighton, with a very violent &s;torm. We were two days and two nights at &s;ea, and beat four and twenty hours off the coa&s;t of Brighton; and it would be difficult for you, who have formed your calculations of time on dry land, to gue&s;s what is the length of four and twenty hours in a &s;torm at &s;ea. At la&s;t, with great difficulty, we landed on the beach, where we found &s;everal of our friends
<PB N="133" REF="024003_0133_0FC2DD24D69094B0">
and acquaintance, who, &s;uppo&s;ing that we might be among the pa&s;&s;engers, &s;ympathized with our danger, and were anxious for our pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>Before the &s;torm became &s;o &s;erious as to ex|clude every idea but that of preparing to die with compo&s;ure, I could not help being divert|ed with the comments on French cu&s;toms, and French politics, which pa&s;&s;ed in the cabin. "Ah," &s;ays one man to his companion, "one had need to go to France, to know how to like old England when one gets back again."&mdash; "For my part," rejoined another, "I've never been able to get drunk once the whole time I was in France&mdash;not a drop of porter to be had&mdash; and as for their victuals, they call a bit of meat of a pound and a half, a fine piece of roa&s;t beef."&mdash;"And pray," added he, turning to one of the &s;ailors, "What do you think of their National A&s;&s;embly?"&mdash;"Why," &s;ays the &s;ailor, "if I ben't mi&s;taken, the National A&s;&s;embly has got &s;ome points from the wind."</P>
<P>I own it has &s;urpri&s;ed me not a little, &s;ince I came to London, to find that mo&s;t of my ac|quaintance are of the &s;ame opinion with the &s;ailor. Every vi&s;itor brings me intelligence from France full of di&s;may and horror. I hear of nothing but crimes, a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations, tor|ture, and death. I am told that every day wit|ne&s;&s;es a con&s;piracy; that every town is the &s;cene of a ma&s;&s;acre; that every &s;treet is black|ened with a gallows, and every highway del|uged with blood. I hear the&s;e things, and re|peat
<PB N="134" REF="024003_0134_0FC2DD2649E562E0">
to my&s;elf, Is this the picture of France? Are the&s;e the images of that univer&s;al joy, which called tears into my eyes, and made my heart throb with &s;ympathy?&mdash;To me, the land which the&s;e mighty magicians have &s;uddenly covered with darkne&s;s, where, waving their evil wand, they have reared the di&s;mal &s;caffold, have clotted the knife of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in with gore&punc; have called forth the &s;hriek of de&s;pair, and the agony of torture; to me, this land of de&s;olation appeared dre&s;t in additional beauty beneath the genial &s;mile of liberty. The woods &s;eemed to ca&s;t a more refre&s;hing &s;hade, and the lawns to wear a brighter verdure, while the carols of freedom bur&s;t from the cottage of the pea&s;ant&punc; and the voice of joy re&s;ounded on the hill, and in the valley.</P>
<P>Mu&s;t I be told that my mind is perverted, that I am become dead to all &s;en&s;ations of &s;ym|pathy, becau&s;e I do not weep with tho&s;e who have lo&s;t a part of their &s;uperfluities, rather than rejoice that the oppre&s;&s;ed are protected, that the wronged are redre&s;&s;ed, that the captive is &s;et at liberty, and that the poor have bread? Did the Univer&s;al Parent of the human race, implant the feelings of pity in the heart, that they &s;hould be confined to the artificial wants of vanity, the ideal deprivations of greatne&s;s; that they &s;hould be fixed beneath the dome of the palace, or locked within the gate of the chateau; without extending one commi&s;erating &s;igh to the wretched hamlet, as if its fami&s;hed inhabitants, though not ennobled by <HI>man,</HI> did
<PB N="135" REF="024003_0135_0FC2DD3448A7D9D0">
not bear, at lea&s;t, the en&s;igns of nobility &s;tamp|ed on our nature by God?</P>
<P>Mu&s;t I hear the charming &s;ocieties, in which I found all the elegant graces of the mo&s;t pol|i&s;hed manners, all the amiable urbanity of lib|eral and cultivated minds, compared with the mo&s;t rude, ferocious, and barbarous levellers that ever exi&s;ted? Really, &s;ome of my Engli&s;h acquaintance, whatever objections they may have to republican principles, do, in their di&s;|cu&s;&s;ions of French politics, adopt a mo&s;t free and republican &s;tyle of cen&s;ure. Nothing can be more democratical than their mode of ex|pre&s;&s;ion, or di&s;play a more levelling &s;pirit, than their unqualified contempt of <HI>all</HI> the lead|ers of the revolution.</P>
<P>It is not my intention to &s;hiver lances, in ev|ery &s;ociety I enter, in the cau&s;e of the Nation|al A&s;&s;embly. Yet I cannot help remarking, that, &s;ince that A&s;&s;embly does not pre&s;ume to &s;et it&s;elf up as an example to this country, we &s;eem to have very little right to be furiou&s;ly angry, becau&s;e they think proper to try anoth|er &s;y&s;tem of government them&s;elves. Why &s;hould they not be &s;uffered to make an experi|ment in politics? I have always been told, that the improvement of every &s;cience depends upon experiment. But I now hear that in|&s;tead of their new attempt to form the great machine of &s;ociety upon a &s;imple principle of general amity, upon tho FEDERATION of its members, they ought to have repaired the feu|dal wheels and &s;prings, by which their ance&s;|tors
<PB N="136" REF="024003_0136_0FC2DD3607C6A578">
directed its movements. Yet if man|kind had always ob&s;erved this retrograde mo|tion, it would &s;urely have led them to few ac|qui&s;itions in virtue, or in knowledge; and we might even have been wor&s;hipping the idols of pagani&s;m at this moment. To forbid, under the pains and penalties of reproach, all attempts of the human mind to advance to greater per|fection, &s;eems to be pro&s;cribing every art and &s;cience. And we cannot much wonder that the French, having received &s;o &s;mall a legacy of public happine&s;s from their forefathers, and being &s;en&s;ible of the poverty of their own patri|mony, &s;hould try new methods of tran&s;mitting a richer inheritance to their po&s;terity.</P>
<P>Perhaps the improvements which mankind may be capable of making in the art of politics, may have &s;ome re&s;emblance to tho&s;e they have made in the art of navigation. Perhaps our political plans may hitherto have been &s;omewhat like tho&s;e ill-con&s;tructed mis&s;hapen ve&s;&s;els, which, unfit to combat with the winds and waves, were only u&s;ed by the ancients to con|vey the warriors of one country to de&s;poil and ravage another neighbouring &s;tate; which only &s;erved to produce an intercour&s;e of ho&s;tility, a communication of injury, an exchange of rap|ine and deva&s;tation. But it may be within the compa&s;s of human po&s;&s;ibility to form a &s;y&s;|tem of politics, which, like a modern &s;hip of di&s;covery, built upon principles that defy the oppo&s;ition of the tempe&s;tuous elements "and pa&s;&s;ions are the elements of life"&mdash;) in|&s;tead
<PB N="137" REF="024003_0137_0FC2DD37994B6338">
of yielding to their fury, makes them &s;ub|&s;ervient to its purpo&s;e, and &s;ailing &s;ublimely over the untracked ocean, unites tho&s;e together whom nature &s;eemed forever to have &s;eparated, and throws a line of connection acro&s;s the di|vided world.</P>
<P>One cau&s;e of the general di&s;like in which the French Revolution is held in this country, is the exaggerated &s;tories which are carefully circulated by &s;uch of the ari&s;tocrates as have taken refuge in England, They are not all, however, per&s;ons of this de&s;cription. There is now a young gentleman in London, nephew to the Bi&s;hop de Sens, who has lo&s;t his fortune, his rank, all his high expectations, and yet who has the genero&s;ity to applaud the revolution, and the magnanimity to reconcile him&s;elf to per&s;onal calamities, from the con&s;ideration of general good; and who is "faithful found" to his country, "among the faithle&s;s." I hope this amiable young Frenchman will live to wit|ne&s;s, and to &s;hare the honours, the pro&s;perity of that regenerated country; and I al&s;o hope that the National A&s;&s;embly of France will an&s;wer the objections of its adver&s;aries in the manner mo&s;t becoming its own dignity, by forming &s;uch a con&s;titution as will render the French nation virtuous, flouri&s;hing, and happy.</P>
