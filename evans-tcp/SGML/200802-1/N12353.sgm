<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY free government &s;hould con&s;i&s;t of three parts, viz. I. A BILL OF RIGHTS. II. A CONSTITUTION, And III. LAWS.</P>
<P N="1">I. The BILL OF RIGHTS &s;hould contain the great principles of <HI>na|tural</HI> and <HI>civil liberty.</HI> It &s;hould be unalterable by any human power.</P>
<P N="2">II. The CONSTITUTION is the executive part of the Bill of Rights. It &s;hould contain the divi&s;ion and di&s;tribution of the power of the people.&mdash;The modes and forms of making laws, of executing ju&s;tice, and of tran&s;acting bu&s;ine&s;s: Al&s;o the limitation of power, as to time and juri&s;diction. It &s;hould be unalterable by the legi&s;lature, and &s;hould be changed only by a repre&s;entation of the people, cho&s;en for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P N="3">III. LAWS are the executive part of a con&s;titution. They cea&s;e to be binding whenever they tran&s;gre&s;s the principles of Liberty, as laid down in the Con&s;titution and Bill of Rights.</P>
<P>Let us now apply the&s;e principles to the Bill of Rights, Con&s;titution and Laws of Penn&s;ylvania. But previous to my entering upon this ta&s;k, I beg leave to declare, that I am not led to it by a &s;ingle party or per&s;onal prejudice; on the contrary, I honour mo&s;t of the friends of the pre&s;ent government as the warme&s;t Whigs among us, and I am proud of numbering &s;everal of the gentlemen who were concerned in making, and in attempting to execute the government, among my particular friends.</P>
<P N="1">I. The Bill of Rights has confounded <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>civil</HI> rights in &s;uch a manner as to produce endle&s;s confu&s;ion in &s;ociety.</P>
<P N="2">II. The Con&s;titution in the gro&s;s is exceptionable in the following particulars:</P>
<P N="1">1. No regard is paid in it to the ancient habits and cu&s;toms of the people of Penn&s;ylvania in the di&s;tribution of the &s;upreme power of the &s;tate, nor in the forms of bu&s;ine&s;s, or in the &s;tile of the Con&s;titution. The &s;uddenne&s;s of the late revolution, the attachment of a large body of the people to the old Con&s;titution of the &s;tate, and the general principles of human nature made an attention to ancient forms and prejudices a matter of the utmo&s;t importance to this &s;tate in the pre&s;ent controver&s;y with Great-Britain. Of &s;o much con&s;equence did the wi&s;e Athenians view the force of ancient habits and cu&s;toms in their laws and government, that they puni&s;hed all <HI>&s;trangers</HI> with death who interfered in their politics. They well knew the effects of novelty upon the minds of the people, and that a more fatal &s;tab could not be
<PB N="4" REF="015589_0003_0F998EC642953588">
given to the peace and &s;afety of their &s;tate than by expo&s;ing its laws and government to frequent or <HI>unnece&s;&s;ary</HI> innovations.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Con&s;titution is wholly repugnant to the principles of action in man, and has a direct tendency to check the progre&s;s of genius and virtue in human nature. It &s;uppo&s;es perfect equality, and an equal di&s;tribution of property, wi&s;dom and virtue, among the inhabitants of the &s;tate.</P>
<P N="3">3. It comprehends many things which belong to a Bill of Rights, and to Laws, and which form no part of a Con&s;titution.</P>
<P N="4">4. It is contrary, in an important article, to the Bill of Rights. By the &s;econd article of the Bill of Rights, "no man can be abridged of any <HI>civil</HI> right, who acknowledges the being of a GOD;" but by the Con&s;titution, no man can take his &s;eat in the A&s;&s;embly, who does not "acknowledge the Scriptures of the Old and New Te&s;tament to be given by divine in&s;piration."</P>
<P N="5">5. It is deficient in point of per&s;picuity and method. In&s;tead of reducing the legi&s;lative, executive and judicial parts of the con&s;titution, with their &s;everal powers and forms of bu&s;ine&s;s, to di&s;tinct heads, the whole of them are jumbled together in a mo&s;t un&s;y&s;tematic manner.</P>
<P N="6">6. It fixes all the&s;e imperfections upon the people for &s;even years, by precluding them from the exerci&s;e of their own power to remove them at any other time, or in any other manner than by a &s;eptennial convention, called by a Council of Cen&s;ors.</P>
<P N="3">III. The laws and proceedings of the A&s;&s;embly of Penn&s;ylvania are in many particulars contrary to the con&s;titution. Only one half of the Members took the oath of allegiance, pre&s;cribed in the tenth &s;ection of the con&s;titution. The Speaker of the Hou&s;e i&s;&s;ued writs for the election of Members of A&s;&s;embly and of Coun&s;ellors, notwith|&s;tanding this power is lodged, by the 19th &s;ection of the con&s;titution, <HI>only</HI> in the Pre&s;ident and Council. Two gentlemen were appointed Members of Congre&s;s, who held offices under the Congre&s;s, which is expre&s;sly forbidden in the 11th &s;ection of the con&s;titution. The con|&s;titution requires further in the 40th &s;ection, that every military officer &s;hould take the oath of allegiance, before he enters upon the execution of his office; but the A&s;&s;embly have di&s;pen&s;ed with this oath in their Militia Law. The 15th &s;ection of the con&s;titution declares, that no law &s;hall be pa&s;&s;ed, unle&s;s it be previou&s;ly publi&s;hed for the con&s;ider|ation of the People; but the A&s;&s;embly pa&s;&s;ed all the laws of their late &s;e&s;&s;ion, without giving the People an opportunity of &s;eeing them, till they were called upon to obey them. The&s;e proceedings of the A&s;|&s;embly lead to one, and perhaps to all the three following conclu&s;ions: Fir&s;t, That the A&s;&s;embly have violated the principles of the con&s;ti|tution; &s;econdly, that the con&s;titution is &s;o formed, that it could not be executed by the A&s;&s;embly, con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;afety of the State; la&s;tly, that none of their laws are binding, ina&s;much as they are con|trary to the &s;uperior and radical laws of the con&s;titution. The&s;e con|&s;iderations are all of a mo&s;t alarming nature. Farewel to Liberty, when the &s;acred bulwarks of a con&s;titution can be invaded by a legi&s;|lature! And if the con&s;titution cannot be executed in all its parts,
<PB N="5" REF="015589_0004_0F998EC6E2568ED0">
without endangering the &s;afety of the State, and if all our late; laws mu&s;t be &s;et a&s;ide in a court of ju&s;tice, becau&s;e they were not a&s;&s;ented to by the People, previous to their being enacted, is it not high time for the People to unite and form a more effectual, and more practi|cable &s;y&s;tem of government?&mdash;</P>
<P>If &s;trict ju&s;tice &s;hould poi&s;e the &s;cale in the trial of tory property, I can ea&s;ily fore&s;ee from the virtue of the People, on which &s;ide the beam would turn; but it becomes us to reflect, that all trials for for|feited property mu&s;t be held in courts of <HI>written</HI> law, and the flaws of our con&s;titution and laws are &s;o wide, that the mo&s;t gigantic Tory criminal might e&s;cape through them.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<P>I SHALL now proceed to &s;ay a few words upon particular parts of the Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd &s;ection, "the &s;upreme legi&s;lature is ve&s;ted in a '<HI>&s;ingle</HI>' Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives of the Freemen of the Commonwealth." By this &s;ection we find, that the &s;upreme, ab&s;olute, and uncontrouled power of the whole State is lodged in the hands of <HI>one body</HI> of men. Had it been lodged in the hands of one man, it would have been le&s;s dangerous to the &s;afety and liberties of the community. Ab&s;olute power &s;hould never be tru&s;ted to man. It has perverted the wi&s;e&s;t heads, and corrupted the be&s;t hearts in the world. I &s;hould be afraid to commit my property, liberty and life to a body of angels for one whole year. The Supreme Being alone is qualified to po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;upreme power over his creatures. It requires the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of a Deity to controul, and direct it properly.</P>
<P>In order to &s;hew the extreme danger of tru&s;ting all the legi&s;lative power of a State to a &s;ingle repre&s;entation, I &s;hall beg leave to tran|&s;cribe a few &s;entences from a letter, written by Mr. JOHN ADAMS, to one of his friends in North-Carolina, who reque&s;ted him to favour him with a plan of government for that State above a twelve-month ago. This illu&s;trious Citizen, who is &s;econd to no man in America, in an inflexible attachment to the liberties of this country, and to re|publican forms of government, writes as follows,</P>
<P>"I think a people cannot be <HI>long free,</HI> nor <HI>ever</HI> happy, who&s;e government is in one A&s;&s;embly. My rea&s;ons for this opinion are as follow,</P>
<P N="1">1. "A &s;ingle A&s;&s;embly is liable to all the vices, follies and frail|ties of an individual,&mdash;&s;ubject to fits of humour,&mdash;&s;tarts of pa&s;&s;ions,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A Committee of the Convention, which formed the Con&s;titution of Penn&s;ylvania, publi&s;hed in the Penn&s;ylvania Packet of October 15, 1776, as an apology for one of their Ordinances, that was thought to be arbitrary and unju&s;t, that it was pa&s;&s;ed when "the minds of the Convention were agitated, and their pa&s;&s;ions inflamed."</NOTE> flights of enthu&s;ia&s;m,&mdash;partialities of prejudice, and consequently pro|ductive
<PB N="6" REF="015589_0005_0F998EC7AA5B71E0">
of ha&s;ty re&s;ults and ab&s;urd judgments. All the&s;e errors ought to be corrected, and defects &s;upplied by &s;ome controuling power.</P>
<P N="2">2. "A &s;ingle A&s;&s;embly is apt to be avaricious, and in time will not &s;cruple to exempt it&s;elf from burdens, which it will lay, without compunction, upon its con&s;tituents.</P>
<P N="3">3. "A &s;ingle A&s;&s;embly is apt to grow ambitious, and after a time will not he&s;itate to vote it&s;elf perpetual. This was one fault of the long parliament, but more remarkably of Holland, who&s;e A&s;&s;embly fir&s;t voted them&s;elves from <HI>annual</HI> to <HI>&s;eptennial,</HI> then for <HI>life,</HI> and after a cour&s;e of years, that all vacancies happening by death or otherwi&s;e, &s;hould be filled by <HI>them&s;elves,</HI> without any application to con&s;tituents at all.</P>
<P N="4">4. "Becau&s;e a &s;ingle A&s;&s;embly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the powers of go|vernment would make arbitrary laws for their own intere&s;t, and ad|judge all controver&s;ies in their own favor."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The&s;e rea&s;ons are given by our Author for not lodging all power le|gi&s;lative, executive and judicial, in one body of men. This has been done, as will be &s;hewn hereafter in the Con&s;titution of Penn&s;ylvania: But, &s;up|po&s;ing it had been otherwi&s;e, our Author adds, "&s;hall the <HI>whole</HI> power of <HI>legi&s;lation</HI> re&s;t in one A&s;&s;embly? Mo&s;t of the foregoing rea&s;ons (one is omitted) apply <HI>equally</HI> to prove, that the whole legi&s;lative power ought to be more <HI>complex.</HI>"</NOTE></P>
<P>If any thing could be nece&s;&s;ary upon this &s;ubject, after &s;uch an authority, I might here add, that Monte&s;quieu&mdash;Harrington&mdash;Mil|ton&mdash;Addi&s;on&mdash;Price&mdash;Bolingbroke, and others, the wi&s;e&s;t &s;tate&s;men, and the greate&s;t friends to Liberty in the world, have left te&s;timonies upon record of the extreme folly and danger of a people's being go|verned by a &s;ingle legi&s;lature. I &s;hall content my&s;elf with the follow|ing extract from the la&s;t of tho&s;e authors. The &s;entiments corre&s;pond exactly with tho&s;e of our countryman before-mentioned.</P>
<P>"By &s;imple forms of government, I mean &s;uch as lodge the whole &s;upreme power, ab&s;olutely and without controul, either in a &s;ingle per&s;on, or in the principal per&s;ons of the community, or in the whole body of the people. Such governments are governments of arbitrary will, and therefore of all imaginable ab&s;urdities the mo&s;t ab&s;urd. They &s;tand in direct oppo&s;ition to the &s;ole motive of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to any government what&s;oever; for if men quit the State, and renounce the rights of nature, (one of which is, to be &s;ure, that of being governed by their own will) they do this, that they may not remain expo&s;ed to the arbitrary will of other men, the weake&s;t to that of the &s;tronge&s;t, the few to that of the many. Now, in &s;ubmitting to any &s;ingle form of government whatever, they e&s;tabli&s;h what they mean to avoid, and for fear of being expo&s;ed to arbitrary will &s;ometimes, they choo&s;e to be governed by it always. The&s;e governments do not only degenerate into tyranny; they are tyranny in their very in&s;titution; and they who &s;ubmit to them, are &s;laves, not &s;ubjects, however the &s;upreme power may be exerci&s;ed; for tyranny and &s;lavery do not &s;o properly con&s;i&s;t in
<PB N="7" REF="015589_0006_0F998EC86F0B7500">
the &s;tripes that are given and received, as in the power of giving them at plea&s;ure, and the nece&s;&s;ity of receiving them, whenever and for whatever they are inflicted."</P>
<P>I might go on further and &s;hew, that all the di&s;&s;entions of Athens and Rome, &s;o dreadful in their nature, and &s;o fetal in their con&s;e|quences, originated in &s;ingle A&s;&s;emblies po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing all the power of tho&s;e commonwealths; but this would be the bu&s;ine&s;s of a volume, and not of a &s;ingle e&s;&s;ay.&mdash;I &s;hall therefore pa&s;s on, to an&s;wer the various arguments that have been u&s;ed in Penn&s;ylvania, in &s;upport of a &s;ingle legi&s;lature.</P>
<P N="1">1. We are told, that the perfection of every thing con&s;i&s;ts in its &s;implicity,&mdash;that all mixtures in government are impurities, and that a &s;ingle legi&s;lature is perfect, becau&s;e it is &s;imple.&mdash;To this I an&s;wer, that we &s;hould di&s;tingui&s;h between &s;implicity in principles, and &s;im|plicity in the application of principles to practice. What can be more &s;imple than the principles of mechanics, and yet into how many thou|&s;and forms have they been tortured by the ingenuity of man. A few &s;imple elementary bodies compo&s;e all the matter of the univer&s;e, and yet how infinitely are they combined in the various forms and &s;ub|&s;tances which they a&s;&s;ume in the animal, vegetable, and mineral king|doms. In like manner a few &s;imple principles enter into the compo|&s;ition of all free governments. The&s;e principles are perfect &s;ecurity for property, liberty and life; but the&s;e principles admit of exten&s;ive com|binations, when reduced to practice:&mdash;Nay more, they require them. A de&s;potic government is the mo&s;t &s;imple government in the world, but in&s;tead of affording &s;ecurity to property, liberty or life, it obliges us to hold them all on the &s;imple will of a capricious &s;overeign. I maintain therefore, that all governments are &s;afe and free in proportion as they are compounded in a certain degree, and on the contrary, that all governments are dangerous and tyrannical in proportion as they approach to &s;implicity.</P>
<P N="2">2. We are told by the friends of a &s;ingle legi&s;lature, that there can be no danger of their becoming tyrannical, &s;ince they mu&s;t partake of all the burdens they lay upon their con&s;tituents. Here we forget the changes that are made upon the head and heart by arbitrary power, and the ca&s;es that are recorded in hi&s;tory of <HI>annual</HI> A&s;&s;emblies having re|fu&s;ed to &s;hare with their con&s;tituents in the burdens which they had impo&s;ed upon them. If every elector in Penn&s;ylvania is capable of being elected an a&s;&s;embly-man, then agreeably to the &s;ixth &s;ection of the con&s;titution, it is po&s;&s;ible for an A&s;&s;embly to exi&s;t who do not po&s;|&s;e&s;s a &s;ingle foot of property in the State, and who can give no other evidence of a common intere&s;t in, or attachment to, the community than having paid "public taxes," which may mean poor-taxes. Should this be the ca&s;e, (and there is no ob&s;tacle in the con&s;titution to prevent it) &s;urely it will be in the power of &s;uch an A&s;&s;embly to draw from the State the whole of its wealth in a few years, without contri|buting any thing further towards it than their proportion of the trifling tax nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport the poor.&mdash;But I &s;hall &s;hew in another place
<PB N="8" REF="015589_0007_0F998EC91A0C1F10">
equal dangers from another cla&s;s of men, becoming a majority in the A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P N="3">3. We are told of in&s;tances of the Hou&s;e of Lords, in England, checking the mo&s;t &s;alutary laws, after they had pa&s;&s;ed the Hou&s;e of Commons, as a proof of the inconvenience of a compound legi&s;lature. I believe the fact to be true, but I deny its application in the pre&s;ent controver&s;y. The Hou&s;e of Lords, in England, po&s;&s;e&s;s privileges and intere&s;ts, which do not belong to the Hou&s;e of Commons. More|over they derive their power from the crown and not from the people. No wonder therefore they con&s;ult their own intere&s;ts, in preference to tho&s;e of the People. In the State of Penn&s;ylvania we wi&s;h for a coun|cil, with <HI>no one</HI> exclu&s;ive privilege, and we di&s;claim every idea of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the &s;malle&s;t degree of power, but what is derived from the <HI>annual</HI> &s;uffrages of the People, A body thus cho&s;en could have no object in view but the happine&s;s of their con&s;tituents. It is remarkable in Connecticut, that the legi&s;lative council of that State has in no one in&s;tance made amendments, or put a negative upon the acts of their A&s;&s;embly, in the cour&s;e of above one hundred years, in which both have not appeared to the people in a few months to have been calcu|lated to promote their liberty and happine&s;s.</P>
<P N="4">4. We are told, that the Congre&s;s is a &s;ingle legi&s;lature, therefore a &s;ingle legi&s;lature is to be preferred to a compound one.&mdash;The objects of legislation in the Congre&s;s relate only to peace and war, alliances, trade, the Po&s;t-Office, and the government of the army and navy. They never touch the liberty, property, nor life of the individuals of any State in their re&s;olutions, and even in their ordinary &s;ubjects of legi&s;lation, they are liable to be checked by <HI>each</HI> of the Thirteen States.</P>
<P N="5">5. We have been told, that a legi&s;lative council or governor lays the foundation for ari&s;tocratical and monarchical power in a community. However ridiculous this objection to a compound legi&s;lature may appear, I have more than once heard it mentioned by the advocates for a &s;ingle A&s;&s;embly. Who would believe, that the &s;ame fountain of pure water &s;hould &s;end forth, at the &s;ame time, whole&s;ome and deadly &s;treams? Are not the Council and A&s;&s;embly both formed alike by the <HI>annual</HI> breath of the people? But I will suppo&s;e, that a legi&s;lative Council a&s;pired after the honors of hereditary titles and power, would they not be <HI>effectually</HI> checked by the A&s;&s;embly?</P>
<P>I cannot help commending the zeal that appears in my countrymen again&s;t the power of a King or a Hou&s;e of Lords. I concur with them in all their prejudices again&s;t hereditary titles, honour and power. Hi&s;tory is little el&s;e than a recital of the follies and vices of kings and noblemen, and it is becau&s;e I dread &s;o much from them, that I wi&s;h to exclude them for ever from Penn&s;ylvania, for notwith&s;tanding our government has been called a &s;imple democracy, I maintain, that a foundation is laid in it for the mo&s;t complete ari&s;tocracy that ever exi&s;ted in the world.</P>
<P>In order to prove this a&s;&s;ertion, I &s;hall promi&s;e two propo&s;itions, which have never been controverted: Fir&s;t, where there is wealth,
<PB N="9" REF="015589_0008_0F998EC9DDB7ECE8">
there will be power; and, &s;econdly, the rich have always been an over-match for the poor in all conte&s;ts for power.</P>
<P>The&s;e truths being admitted, I de&s;ire to know what can prevent our &s;ingle repre&s;entation being filled, in the cour&s;e of a few years, with a majority of rich men? Say not, the people will not choo&s;e &s;uch men to repre&s;ent them. The influence of wealth at elections is irre&s;i&s;tible. It has been &s;een and felt in Penn&s;ylvania, and I am obliged in ju&s;tice to my &s;ubject to &s;ay, that there are poor men among us as prepared to be influenced, as the rich are prepared to influence them. The fault mu&s;t be laid in both ca&s;es upon human nature. The con&s;equence of a majority of rich men getting into the legi&s;lature is plain. Their wealth will admini&s;ter fuel to the love of arbitrary power that is com|mon to all men. The pre&s;ent A&s;&s;embly have furni&s;hed them with precedents for breaking the Con&s;titution. Farewel now to annual elections! Public emergencies will &s;anctify the mo&s;t daring mea&s;ures. The clamours of their con&s;tituents will be &s;ilenced with offices, bribes or puni&s;hments. An ari&s;tocracy will be e&s;tabli&s;hed, and Penn&s;ylvania will be inhabited like mo&s;t of the countries in Europe, with only two &s;orts of animals, tyrants and &s;laves.</P>
<P>It has often been &s;aid, that there is but one rank of men in Ame|rica, and therefore, that there &s;hould be only one repre&s;entation of them in a government. I agree, that we have no artificial di&s;tinctions of men into noblemen and commoners among us, but it ought to be re|marked, that &s;uperior degrees of indu&s;try and capacity, and above all, commerce, have introduced inequality of property among us, and the&s;e have introduced natural di&s;tinctions of rank in Penn&s;ylvania, as certain and general as the artificial di&s;tinctions of men in Europe. This will ever be the ca&s;e while commerce exi&s;ts in this country. The men of middling property and poor men can never be &s;afe in a mixed repre|&s;entation with the men of over-grown property. Their liberties can only be &s;ecured by having exact bounds pre&s;cribed to their power, in the fundamental principles of the Con&s;titution. By a repre&s;entation of the men of middling fortunes in one hou&s;e, their <HI>whole</HI> &s;trength is collected again&s;t the influence of wealth. Without &s;uch a repre&s;enta|tion, the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> violent efforts of individuals to oppo&s;e it would be di|vided and broken, and would want that &s;y&s;tem, which alone would enable them to check that lust for dominion which is always connected with opulence. The government of Penn&s;ylvania therefore has been called mo&s;t improperly a government for poor men. It carries in every part of it a poi&s;on to their liberties. It is impo&s;&s;ible to form a govern|ment more &s;uited to the nations and intere&s;ts of rich men.</P>
<P N="6">6. But &s;ays the advocate for a &s;ingle legi&s;lature, if one of the ad|vantages of having a Legi&s;lative Council ari&s;es from the Coun&s;ellors po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing more wi&s;dom than the A&s;&s;embly, why may not the mentors of the Council be thrown into the A&s;&s;embly, in order to in&s;truct and enlighten them? If &s;ound rea&s;oning always prevailed in popular A&s;&s;emblies, this objection to a Legi&s;lative Council might have &s;ome weight. The danger in this ca&s;e would be, that the Counsellors would
<PB N="10" REF="015589_0009_0F998ECB41491230">
partake of the pa&s;&s;ions and prejudices of the A&s;&s;embly, by taking part in their debates; or, if they did not, that they would be &s;o incon|&s;iderable in point of numbers, that they would be con&s;tantly out-voted by the members of the A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P N="7">7. But would you &s;uffer twenty or thirty men in a Legi&s;lative Coun|cil to controul &s;eventy or eighty in an A&s;&s;embly? Yes, and that for two rea&s;ons: Fir&s;t, I &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e that they will con&s;i&s;t of men of the mo&s;t knowledge and experience in the State: Secondly, that their ob|ligations to wi&s;dom and integrity will be much &s;tronger than the A&s;&s;embly's can be, becau&s;e fewer men will be an&s;werable for unju&s;t or improper proceedings at the bar of the public. But I beg pardon of my readers for introducing an an&s;wer to an objection to a &s;mall num|ber of men controuling the proceedings of a greater. The friends of the pre&s;ent Con&s;titution of Penn&s;ylvania cannot urge this objection with any force, for in the 47th &s;ection of the Con&s;titution I find twenty-four men called a COUNCIL of CENSORS, inve&s;ted with a &s;upreme and <HI>uncontrouled</HI> power to revi&s;e and to cen&s;ure all the laws and proceedings of not a &s;ingle A&s;&s;embly, but of all the A&s;&s;emblies that &s;hall exi&s;t for &s;even years, which A&s;&s;emblies may contain the united wi&s;dom of five hundred and four A&s;&s;embly-men. They are moreover, inve&s;ted with more wi&s;dom than the Convention that is to be cho&s;en by their recom|mendation; for this Convention, which is to con&s;i&s;t of &s;eventy-two men, is to make no <HI>one</HI> alteration in the Con&s;titution but what was &s;ugge&s;ted to them by the Council of Cen&s;ors. I can ea&s;ily conceive, that two hou&s;es con&s;i&s;ting of an unequal number of members, both viewing objects through the &s;ame medium of time and place, may agree in every thing e&s;&s;ential, and di&s;agree in matters only of doubtful i&s;&s;ue to the welfare of the &s;tate; but I am &s;ure, a body of twenty-four men fating in judgment upon the proceedings of a body of men defunct in their public capacity &s;even years before them, cannot fail of com|mitting the mo&s;t egregious mi&s;takes from the ob&s;curity which time, and their ignorance of a thou&s;and facts and rea&s;onings mu&s;t throw upon all their deliberations. But more of the arbitrary power of the Cen|&s;ors hereafter.</P>
<P N="8">8. We are told that the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania has always been go|verned by a &s;ingle legi&s;lature, and therefore, that part of our Con&s;ti|tution is not an innovation. There is a &s;hort way of confuting this a&s;&s;ertion by pronouncing it without any foundation. The Governor al|ways had a negative power upon our laws, and was a di&s;tinct branch of our legi&s;lature. It is true, he &s;ometimes exerci&s;ed his power to the di&s;|advantage of the people; for he was the &s;ervant of a King who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an intere&s;t di&s;tinct from that of his people, and in &s;ome ca&s;es the Go|vernor him&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an intere&s;t incompatible with the rights of the people. God forbid that ever we &s;hould &s;ee a re&s;urrection of his power in Penn&s;ylvania, but I am obliged to own, that I have known in&s;tances in which the <HI>whole</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> have thanked him for the interpo&s;ition of his negative and amendments upon the acts of the A&s;&s;embly. Even the A&s;&s;embly them&s;elves have acknowledged the ju&s;tice of his conduct
<PB N="11" REF="015589_0010_0F998ECBCE8170A0">
upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, by condemning in their cooler hours their own ha&s;ty, and ill-dige&s;ted re&s;olutions.</P>
<P N="9">9. But why all the&s;e arguments in favor of checks for the A&s;&s;embly. The Con&s;titution (&s;ays the &s;ingle legi&s;lative-man) has provided no le&s;s than four for them. Fir&s;t, Elections will be annual. Secondly, The doors of the A&s;&s;embly are to be always open. Thirdly, All laws are to be publi&s;hed for the con&s;ideration and a&s;&s;ent of the people: And, Fourthly, The Council of Cen&s;ors will puni&s;h, by their cen&s;ures, all violations of the Con&s;titution, and the authors of bad laws. I &s;hall examine the efficacy of each of the&s;e checks &s;eparately.</P>
<P>I hope, for the peace of the &s;tate, that we &s;hall never &s;ee a body of men in power more attached to the pre&s;ent Con&s;titution than the pre|&s;ent A&s;&s;embly, and if, with all their affection for it, they have broken it in many articles, it is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that future A&s;&s;emblies will u&s;e the &s;ame freedoms with it. They may, if they chu&s;e, aboli&s;h annual elections.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The late Convention was cho&s;en for the <HI>&s;ole</HI> purpo&s;e of making a government, and was compo&s;ed of hone&s;t, well-meaning men, and yet, I have good authority to &s;ay, that &s;everal of them propo&s;ed to their friends forming them&s;elves into an A&s;&s;embly, to execute the government.</NOTE> They may tell their con&s;tituents that elections draw off the minds of the people from nece&s;&s;ary labour; or, if a war &s;hould exi&s;t, they may &s;hew the impo&s;&s;ibility of holding elections when there is a chance of the militia being called into the field to oppo&s;e a common enemy: Or la&s;tly, they may fetter elections with oaths in &s;uch a man|ner as to exclude nine-tenths of the electors from voting. Such &s;tra|tagems for perpetual power will never want men nor a <HI>society</HI> of men to &s;upport them; for the A&s;&s;embly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;uch a plenitude of power from the influence of the many offices of profit and honour<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Pre&s;ident is appointed chiefly by the A&s;&s;embly.

But I will &s;uppo&s;e that no infringement is ever made upon annual elections. In the cour&s;e of even one year a &s;ingle A&s;&s;embly may do the mo&s;t irreparable mi&s;chief to a &s;tate. Socrates and Barnevelt were both put to death by A&s;&s;emblies that held their powers at the election of the people. The &s;ame A&s;&s;emblies would have &s;hed oceans of tears to have recalled tho&s;e illu&s;trious citizens to life again, in le&s;s than half a year after they imbrued their hands in their blood.</P>
<P>I am highly plea&s;ed with having the doors of our A&s;&s;embly kept con&s;tantly open; but how can this check the proceedings of the A&s;&s;embly, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> none but a few citizens of the town or county, where

the A&s;&s;embly &s;its, or a few travelling &s;trangers, can ever attend or watch them?</P>
<P>I &s;hall take no notice of the delays of bu&s;ine&s;s, which mu&s;t ari&s;e from publi&s;hing all laws for the con&s;ideration and a&s;&s;ent of the people; but I beg to be informed <HI>how long</HI> they mu&s;t be publi&s;hed before they are pa&s;&s;ed? For I take it for granted, that each county has a right to equal degrees of time to con&s;ider of the laws. In what manner are they to be circulated? How are the &s;entiments of the people, &s;cattered over a county fifty or &s;ixty miles in extent, to be collected? Whether by ballot, or by voting in a tumultuary manner? The&s;e are in&s;ur|mountable difficulties in the way of the people at <HI>large</HI> acting as a check upon the A&s;&s;embly. But &s;uppo&s;ing an attempt &s;hould be made to re|&s;train the &s;ingle legi&s;lature in this manner, are we &s;ure the di&s;appro|bation of the people would be &s;ufficient to put a negative upon impro|per or arbitrary laws? Would not the A&s;&s;embly, from their partiality to their own proceedings, be apt to pa&s;s over the complaints of the people in &s;ilence? to neglect or refu&s;e to enter their petitions or re|mon&s;trances upon their Journals? or to rai&s;e the hue and cry of a fo|&s;tered junto upon them, as "<HI>tories</HI>" or "<HI>apo&s;tate whigs,</HI>" or "<HI>an ari&s;tocratic faction?</HI>"</P>
<P>To talk of the Council of Cen&s;ors, as a check upon the A&s;&s;embly, is to forget that a man or a body of men may deceive, rob, and en|&s;lave the public for &s;even years, and then may e&s;cape the intended efficacy of the cen&s;ures of the Council by death, or by flying into a neighbouring &s;tate.</P>
<P N="10">10. We are informed that a &s;ingle legi&s;lature was &s;upported in the Convention by Dr. Franklin, and a&s;&s;ented to by Mr. Rittenhou&s;e; gentlemen di&s;tingui&s;hed for their uncommon abilities, and de&s;ervedly dear for their virtues to every lover of human nature. The only an|&s;wer, after what has been &s;aid, that I &s;hall give to this argument, is, that Divine Providence &s;eems to have permitted them to <HI>err</HI> upon this &s;ubject, in order to con&s;ole the world for the very great &s;uperiority they both po&s;&s;e&s;s over the re&s;t of mankind in every thing el&s;e, except the &s;cience of government.</P>
<P>Thus have I an&s;wered all the arguments that ever I have heard of|fered in favour of a &s;ingle legi&s;lature, and I hope, &s;ilenced all the ob|jections that have been made to a double repre&s;entation of the people. I might here appeal further to the practice of our courts of law in fa|vour of repeated deliberations and divi&s;ions. In a free government, the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable portion of our liberty and property cannot be taken from us, without the judgment of two or three courts; but, by the Con&s;titution of Penn&s;ylvania, the whole of our liberty and pro|perty, and even our lives, may be taken from us, by the ha&s;ty and pa&s;&s;ionate deci&s;ion of a &s;ingle A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude my ob&s;ervations upon this part of the Con&s;titution, by &s;umming up the advantages of a compound or double legi&s;lature.</P>
<P N="1">1. There is the utmo&s;t <HI>freedom</HI> in a compound legi&s;lature. The
<PB N="13" REF="015589_0012_0F998ECD9A620740">
deci&s;ions of two legi&s;lature bodies cannot fail of coinciding with the wills of a great majority of the community.</P>
<P N="2">2. There is <HI>&s;afety</HI> in &s;uch a government, in as much as each body po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a free and independant power, &s;o that they mutually check ambition and u&s;urpation in each other.</P>
<P N="3">3. There is the greate&s;t <HI>wi&s;dom</HI> in &s;uch a government. Every act being obliged to undergo the revi&s;ion and amendments of two bodies of men, is nece&s;&s;arily &s;trained of every mixture of folly, pa&s;&s;ion, and prejudice.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Militia Law of the Delaware State received twenty-four amend|ments from the Council after it had bad three readings in the A&s;&s;embly; all of which were adopted at once by the A&s;&s;embly. I grant, the wi&s;dom of men collected in any way that can be devi&s;ed, cannot make a <HI>perfect</HI> law; but I am &s;ure a Legi&s;lative Council would not have overlooked many inac|curacies in the laws pa&s;&s;ed in the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of the pre&s;ent A&s;&s;embly of Penn&s;ylvania.</NOTE></P>
<P N="4">4. There is the longe&s;t <HI>duration</HI> of freedom in &s;uch a government.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sparta, which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a compound legi&s;lature, pre&s;erved her liberties above five hundred years. The fatal di&s;&s;entions of Athens and Rome cea&s;ed as &s;oon as their Senates, which were filled only with rich men, were checked by another Repre&s;entation of the people.</NOTE></P>
<P N="5">5. There is the mo&s;t <HI>order</HI> in &s;uch a government. By order, I mean obedience to laws, &s;ubordination to magi&s;trates, civility and decency of behaviour, and the contrary of every thing like mobs and factions.</P>
<P N="6">6. Compound governments are mo&s;t agreeable to <HI>human nature,</HI> ina&s;much as they afford the greate&s;t &s;cope for the expan&s;ion of the powers and virtues of the mind. Wi&s;dom, learning, experience, with the mo&s;t exten&s;ive benevolence; the mo&s;t un&s;haken firmne&s;s, and the utmo&s;t elevation of &s;oul, are all called into exerci&s;e by the oppo&s;ite and different duties of the different repre&s;entations of the people.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER III.</HEAD>
<P>THE powers of government have been very ju&s;tly divided into legi&s;lative, executive and judicial. Having di&s;cu&s;&s;ed the legis|lative power of the government of Penn&s;ylvania, I &s;hall proceed now to con&s;ider the executive and judicial.</P>
<P>It is agreed on all hands that the executive and judicial powers of government &s;hould be <HI>wholly independant</HI> of the legi&s;lative. The authors of the Penn&s;ylvania Con&s;titution <HI>&s;eem</HI> to have given their &s;anction to this opinion, by &s;eparating tho&s;e powers from the powers of the A&s;&s;embly.&mdash;It becomes us to enquire whether they have made them &s;o independant of the A&s;&s;embly as to give them the free exerci&s;e of their own judgments.</P>
<P>The in&s;ignificant figure the Pre&s;ident and Council make in the Con|&s;titution
<PB N="14" REF="015589_0014_0F998ED24041B068">
from not having a negative upon the laws of the A&s;&s;embly, alone would &s;oon have de&s;troyed their authority and influence in the State. But the authors of the Con&s;titution have taken pains to throw the whole power of the Council at once into the hands of the A&s;&s;embly, by rendering the former dependant upon the latter in the two following particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Pre&s;ident is cho&s;en by the joint ballot of the A&s;&s;embly and Council. The A&s;&s;embly being to the Council, in point of numbers, as five are to one, of cour&s;e chu&s;e the Pre&s;ident. Each member will expect in his turn to fill the fir&s;t chair in the State, and hence the whole Council will yield them&s;elves up to the will of the A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P N="2">2. The &s;alaries of the Pre&s;ident and of each of the Coun&s;ellors are fixed by the A&s;&s;embly. This will nece&s;&s;arily render them dependant upon them. It is worthy of notice here, that a rotation is e&s;tabli&s;hed in the 19th &s;ection of the Con&s;titution, to "prevent the danger of an inconvenient ari&s;tocracy."&mdash;From what abu&s;e of power can this ari&s;tocracy ari&s;e? Are they not the creatures of the A&s;&s;embly? But there is a magic terror in the &s;ound of a Coun&s;ellor. Call a man an A&s;&s;em|blyman, or a Cen&s;or, and he becomes an innocent creature, though you inve&s;t him with the de&s;poti&s;m of an ea&s;tern monarch. If the Council are dependant upon the A&s;&s;embly, it follows of cour&s;e that the Judges, who are appointed by the Council, are likewi&s;e depend|ant upon them. But in order more fully to &s;ecure their depend|ance upon the will of the A&s;&s;embly, they are obliged to hold their &s;alaries upon the tenure of their will. In vain do they hold their commi&s;&s;ions for &s;even years. This is but the &s;hadow of independance. They cannot live upon the air, and their ab&s;olute de|pendance upon the A&s;&s;embly gives that body a tran&s;cendent influence over all the courts of law in the State. Here then we have di&s;covered the legi&s;lative, executive and judicial powers of the State all blended to|gether.&mdash;The liberty, the property and life of every individual in the State are laid pro&s;trate by the Con&s;titution at the feet of the A&s;&s;embly. This combination of powers in one body has in all ages been pro|nounced a tyranny. To live by one man's will became the cau&s;e of all men's mi&s;ery; but better, far better, would it be to live by the will of one man, than to live, or rather to die, by the will of a body of men. Unhappy Penn&s;ylvania! Methinks I &s;ee the &s;cales of ju&s;tice broken in thy courts.&mdash;I &s;ee the dowry of the widow and the portion of the or|phans unju&s;tly taken from them, in order to gratify the avarice of &s;ome demagogue who rules the A&s;&s;embly by his eloquence and arts.&mdash;I &s;ee the &s;caffolds &s;treaming with the blood of the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t men in the State.&mdash;I &s;ee the offices of government&mdash;But the pro&s;pect is too painful, I &s;hall proceed to take notice of &s;ome other parts of the Con|&s;titution.</P>
<P>It was not &s;ufficient to contaminate ju&s;tice at its fountain, but its &s;malle&s;t &s;treams are made to partake of impurity by the Convention. In the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ection of the Con&s;titution "all Ju&s;tices of the Peace are to be elected by the freeholders of each city and county." The be&s;t
<PB N="15" REF="015589_0014_0F998ED24041B068">
ob&s;ervations that can be made on this part of the Con&s;titution is to in|form the public, that not above one half the people of the State cho&s;e magi&s;trates agreeable to the laws of the A&s;&s;embly for that purpo&s;e; that more than one half of tho&s;e that were cho&s;en have refu&s;ed to ac|cept of commi&s;&s;ions, and that many of tho&s;e who act are totally dis|qualified from the want of education or leisure for the office.&mdash;It has been said often, and I wi&s;h the &s;aying was engraven over the doors of every &s;tatehou&s;e on the Continent, that "all power is <HI>derived</HI> from the people," but it has never yet been &s;aid that all power is <HI>&s;eated</HI> in the people. Government &s;uppo&s;es and requires a delegation of power: It cannot exi&s;t without it. And the idea of making the people at large judges of the qualifications nece&s;&s;ary for magi&s;trates, or judges of laws, or checks for A&s;&s;emblies proceeds upon the &s;uppo&s;ition that mankind are all alike wi&s;e, and ju&s;t, and have equal lei&s;ure. It more|over de&s;troys the nece&s;&s;ity for all government. What man ever made him&s;elf his own attorney? And yet this would not be more ab&s;urd than for the people at <HI>large</HI> to pretend to give up their power to a &s;et of rulers, and afterwards re&s;erve the right of making and of judging of all their laws them&s;elves. Such a government is a mon&s;ter in nature. It contains as many Governors, A&s;&s;emblymen, Judges and Magi&s;trates as there are freemen in the State, all exerci&s;ing the &s;ame powers and at the &s;ame time. Happy would it be for us, if this mon&s;ter was remark|able only for his ab&s;urdity; but, alas! he contains a tyrant-in his bowels. All hi&s;tory &s;hews us that the people &s;oon grow weary of the folly and tyranny of one another. They prefer one to many matters, and &s;tability to in&s;tability of &s;lavery. They prefer a Julius Cae&s;ar to a Senate, and a Cromwell to a perpetual parliament.</P>
<P>I cannot help thinking a mi&s;take lays rather in words than ideas when we talk of the rights of the people. Where is the difference be|tween my chu&s;ing a Ju&s;tice of Peace, and my chu&s;ing an A&s;&s;emblyman and a Coun&s;ellor, by who&s;e joint &s;uffrages a Governor is cho&s;en, who appoints a Ju&s;tice for me? I am &s;till the fir&s;t link of the &s;acred chain of the power of the State. But are there no ca&s;es in which I may be bound by acts of a &s;ingle, or of a body of magi&s;trates in the State, whom I have had no hand in chu&s;ing? Yes, there are. Here then I am bound contrary to the principles of liberty (which con&s;i&s;t in a man be|ing governed by men cho&s;en by him&s;elf), whereas if all the magi&s;trates in the State were appointed by the Governor, or executive part of the State, it would be impo&s;&s;ible for me to appear before the bar of a ma|gi&s;trate any where who did not derive his power <HI>originally</HI> from me.</P>
<P>By the 5th &s;ection all militia officers below the rank of a Brigadier General are to be cho&s;en by the people. Mo&s;t of the objections that have been mentioned again&s;t magi&s;trates being cho&s;en by the people, apply with equal force again&s;t the people's chu&s;ing their military of|ficers. By the militia law of this State we find the &s;oldier cea&s;es to be commanded by the officer of his choice as &s;oon as he comes in the field. He might as well be commanded by an officer of another State as by one of his own State, for whom he did not vote. Had he been ap|pointed
<PB N="16" REF="015589_0015_0F998ED3E5397310">
by the executive power of the government, he might have looked upon him originally as the creature of his own power, and might have claimed his care in the camp, from his influence at elections, in moving tho&s;e &s;prings in government, from which he derived his commi&s;&s;ion. But the un&s;uitablene&s;s of this part of the Con&s;titution to the genius of the people of Penn&s;ylvania, will appear in the &s;tronge&s;t point of light, from attending to the two following facts: 1&s;t: Mo&s;t of the irregularities committed by the militia, that were in &s;ervice la&s;t year, were occa&s;ioned by that laxity of di&s;cipline, which was intro|duced and kept up by officers holding their commi&s;&s;ions by the breath of the people: And 2dly, Above one half of the State have refu&s;ed or neglected to chu&s;e officers, agreeably to the recommendation of the A&s;&s;embly.&mdash;And even in many of tho&s;e places, where elections for officers have been held, Colonels have been cho&s;en by forty and Cap|tains and Subalterns by only four or five votes.</P>
<P>In the 22d &s;ection of the Con&s;titution it is &s;aid, "every officer of the &s;tate, whether judicial or executive, &s;hall be liable to be impeached by the General A&s;&s;embly, before the Pre&s;ident and Council, either when in office or after his re&s;ignation or removal for maladmini&s;tration." Why is a man in this ca&s;e to be deprived of a trial by jury? and what is the rea&s;on that no <HI>time</HI> is <HI>fixed</HI> for the commencement of this im|peachment after resignation or removal for maladmini&s;tration? A ju|dicial or military officer may be innocent, and yet, from the delay of his trial for &s;ix or &s;even years, he may be deprived by death or other|ways of the vouchers of his innocence. Woe to the man that ever holds one of the high offices of the State of Penn&s;ylvania! He mu&s;t ever, after his re&s;ignation, hold his life at the plea&s;ure of the orator who rules the A&s;&s;embly. The lea&s;t mark of di&s;re&s;pect &s;hewn to him, or to any of the A&s;&s;embly, rou&s;es the Con&s;titution and laws of his country again&s;t him; and perhaps, after an interval of twenty or thirty years conscious integrity, his grey hairs are dragged with &s;or|row to the grave. Let not this be thought to be too high a picture of this part of the Con&s;titution of Penn&s;ylvania. It is a picture of human nature in &s;imilar circum&s;tances, in every age and country. Men po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of unlimited and uncontrouled power are bea&s;ts of prey.</P>
<P>But, is there no power lodged in the Con&s;titution to alter the&s;e im|perfections? Has our Convention monopolized all the wi&s;dom of &s;uc|ceeding years, &s;o as to preclude any improvements being made in the infant &s;cience of government? Mu&s;t we groan away our lives in a pa|tient &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to all the evils in the Con&s;titution which have been de&s;cribed? Let the 47th and la&s;t &s;ection of the Con&s;titution an&s;wer the&s;e que&s;tions. By this &s;ection it is declared, that after the expiration of &s;even years, there &s;hall "be cho&s;en two men from each city and county, (a majority of whom &s;hall be a quorum in every ca&s;e, except as to <HI>calling a Convention</HI>) who &s;hall be called a Council of Cen&s;ors, and who &s;hall have power to call a Convention within two years after their fitting, if there appears to them an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of amending any article of the Con&s;titution which may be defective, explaining &s;uch
<PB N="17" REF="015589_0016_0F998ED45B296E20">
as may be thought not clearly expre&s;&s;ed, and of adding &s;uch as are nece&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;ervation of the rights and happine&s;s of the people." From this paragraph it is evident, that the Con&s;titution was thought to be the perfection of human wi&s;dom, and that the authors of it in|tended that it &s;hould la&s;t for ever. Every &s;ection of the Con&s;titution, I believe, was determined by a <HI>majority</HI> of the Members of the Con|vention, and in the 12th &s;ection of the Con&s;titution we find, that if only two-thirds of the people concur in the execution of it, the mem|bers of A&s;&s;embly cho&s;en by them, are to "po&s;&s;e&s;s all the powers of the General A&s;&s;embly as fully and amply as if the whole were pre&s;ent." This is &s;trictly agreeable to the principles of good government; but, why are the&s;e principles to be trampled upon, when the great que&s;tion is to be agitated, whether the Con&s;titution &s;hall be altered? For, un|le&s;s every county and city in the State concur in electing Cen&s;ors, and unle&s;s <HI>two thirds</HI> of them agree in calling a Convention, there is no po&s;&s;ibility of obtaining an alteration of a &s;ingle article of the Con&s;titution. If the A&s;&s;embly had not taught us that it was neither trea&s;on nor perjury to break the Con&s;titution, I am &s;ure it would have remained inviolate for ever; for I am per&s;uaded that &s;everal of the counties would have refu&s;ed to have cho&s;en Cen&s;ors. But &s;uppo&s;e they had, if only one &s;hort of <HI>two thirds</HI> of them refu&s;ed to agree in the mea&s;ure, we could have no Convention. The minority would give laws to a ma|jority. A &s;oleci&s;m in government! But there is no end to the tyranny and ab&s;urdity of our Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>But the Council of Cen&s;ors have not yet fini&s;hed their bu&s;ine&s;s. They are empowered by the Con&s;titution "to enquire, whether the <HI>Con&s;titution</HI> has been pre&s;erved <HI>inviolate</HI> in <HI>every</HI> part? and whether the legi&s;lative and executive branches of government have performed their duty, as guardians of the people; or a&s;&s;umed to them&s;elves, or exerci&s;ed <HI>other</HI> or greater powers than they are entitled to by the Con|&s;titution: They are al&s;o to enquire, whether the public taxes have been ju&s;tly laid and collected in all parts of this commonwealth;&mdash;in what manner the public monies have been di&s;po&s;ed of, and whether the laws have been duly executed: For the&s;e purpo&s;es they &s;hall have power to &s;end for per&s;ons, papers and records; they &s;hall have autho|rity to pa&s;s public cen&s;ures, and to recommend to the legi&s;lature, the repealing &s;uch laws as appear to them to have been enacted contrary to the principles of the Con&s;titution: The&s;e powers they &s;hall continue to have for, and during the &s;pace of one year, from the day of their election, and no longer."</P>
<P>Is this the commi&s;&s;ion of the Grand Turk? or is it an extract from an act of the Briti&s;h Parliament, teeming with vengeance again&s;t the liberties of America?&mdash;No.&mdash;It is an epitome of the powers of the Council of Cen&s;ors e&s;tabli&s;hed by the late Convention of Penn&s;ylvania. Innocence has nothing to fear from ju&s;tice, when it flows through the regular channels of law; but where is the man who can en&s;ure him&s;elf a moment's &s;afety from a body of men inve&s;ted with ab&s;olute power for one whole year to cen&s;ure and condemn, without judge or jury,

every individual in the State. I &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e the Council to con&s;i&s;t of a majority of tho&s;e Members of A&s;&s;embly, who took the oath of alle|giance to the Con&s;titution, and who voted, that no officer &s;hould be excu&s;ed from taking it, who accepted of a militia-commi&s;&s;ion under the authority of this State. I &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e them a&s;&s;embled for the bu&s;ine&s;s of their office. The work of an age is to be performed in a &s;ingle year.&mdash;Methinks I &s;ee &s;uch of tho&s;e worthy gentlemen as are living, who, for the &s;ake of union, con&s;ented to di&s;pen&s;e with the oath of al|legiance to the Con&s;titution, led like criminals to their bar.&mdash;I hear peals of wrath denounced again&s;t them. I &s;ee tho&s;e virtuous gentle|men, who compo&s;ed the Executive Council in the year 1777, &s;um|moned to appear at their tribunal, to an&s;wer for their having abdi|dicated the duties of their office, by an adjournment, at a time when the State was threatened with an inva&s;ion. In vain they plead, that the Con&s;titution had inve&s;ted them with no power for the defence of the State. Their names and their families are branded with infamy by a "public cen&s;ure." I &s;ee hundreds and thou&s;ands coming, one after another, before the Council, to be cen&s;ured for refu&s;ing to chu&s;e magi&s;trates and militia-officers, agreeably to the laws of the A&s;&s;embly. But who are they who are dragged with &s;o much violence to the inqui|&s;itorial tribunal? They are a number of citizens who prayed for &s;ome alterations to be made in the Con&s;titution. In vain they plead the obligations of rea&s;on and con&s;cience again&s;t &s;ubmitting to the government. In vain they plead their zeal and &s;ervices in the common cau&s;e of America. It is all to no purpo&s;e. They recommend to the A&s;&s;embly to impeach them for high trea&s;on. They are condemned as traitors, and the &s;treets &s;wim with their blood.&mdash;Good heavens! where was the mild genius of Penn&s;ylvania, when this part of the Con&s;titution obtained the a&s;&s;ent of the Convention?&mdash;Spirit of liberty, whither waft thou &s;led?&mdash;</P>
<P>But perhaps the Con&s;titution has provided a remedy for its defects, without the aid of the Council of Cen&s;ors? No&mdash;this cannot be done; for every Member of A&s;&s;embly, before he takes his &s;eat, is obliged, by the 10th &s;ection of the Con&s;titution, to &s;wear that he will not "do nor con&s;ent to any act whatever, that &s;hall have a tendency to le&s;&s;en or abridge their rights and privileges as declared <HI>in the Con&s;titution of this State,</HI>" as al&s;o, "that he will not directly or indirectly do or con&s;ent to any act or thing prejudicial or injurious to the Con&s;titution or Go|vernment thereof, as <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Convention,</HI>" agreeably to the 40th &s;ection of the Con&s;titution. The&s;e oaths of infallibility and pa&s;|&s;ive obedience to the form of the Con&s;titution, effectually preclude every man, who holds an office under it, from attempting to procure the lea&s;t amendment in any part of it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That it was the de&s;ign of the Convention, that the Con&s;titution &s;hould not be touched by any power but a Convention to be called by the Council of Cen&s;ors, appears from the oath contained in the 40th &s;ection, being required by one of their ordinances as the only condition upon which an Elector could vote for an A&s;&s;emblyman. Strange! that men &s;hould call God to witne&s;s their determination to &s;upport a government, which a majority of them had not &s;een, and which even the minority of them did not under&s;tand or di&s;liked! But, for the honour of the State it &s;hould be recorded, that not above 1500 of the 2500, who voted for the A&s;&s;embly, took the oath required by the or|dinance of the Convention.</NOTE> It is a mere quibble upon
<PB N="19" REF="015589_0018_0F998ED5DD204C80">
words to &s;ay, that a man may mend the Con&s;titution, without "doing any thing prejudicial or injurious to it." The Convention did not intend any &s;uch con&s;truction to be put upon their oaths, and hence we find in the introduction to the Con&s;titution, they "declare the frame of government to be the Con&s;titution of this commonwealth, and to remain in force therein <HI>for ever, unaltered,</HI> except in &s;uch articles as &s;hall hereafter, upon experience, be found to require improvement, and which &s;hall, by the &s;ame authority of the people fairly delegated, as this <HI>frame of government</HI> directs, be amended and improved." Now we know, that the frame of government forbids the lea&s;t amendment being made in the Con&s;titution in any other than by the recommenda|tion of a Council of Cen&s;ors.</P>
<P>Had the Con&s;titution appeared to me to have been unexceptionable in every part, and had it been the re&s;ult of the united wi&s;dom of men and angels, I would not have taken an oath of pa&s;&s;ive obedience to it, for &s;even or nine years. The con&s;tant changes in human affairs, and in the di&s;po&s;itions of a people, might render occa&s;ional alterations, in that time, nece&s;&s;ary in the mo&s;t perfeft Con&s;titution. But to take an oath of allegiance to a Con&s;titution,&mdash;full of experiments,&mdash;a Con&s;ti|tution that was indeed a new thing under the &s;un,&mdash;that had never been tried in &s;ome of its parts in <HI>any</HI> country,&mdash;and that had produced mi&s;ery in other of its parts in <HI>every</HI> country,&mdash;I &s;ay to &s;wear to &s;upport or even to &s;ubmit, for &s;even or nine years, to &s;uch a Con&s;titution, is to trifle with all morality, and to di&s;honour the &s;acred name of GOD him&s;elf.</P>
<P>What would you think of a man, who would con&s;ent to &s;hut his eyes, and &s;wallow a quantity of food that had never before been ta&s;ted by a human creature, and &s;wear at the &s;ame time, that if it &s;hould di&s;|order him in ever &s;o great a degree, he would take nothing to relieve him for eight and forty hours? Such a man would be wife, compared with the man who takes an oath of allegiance to the Con&s;titution of Penn&s;ylvania.</P>
<P>It is to no purpo&s;e to talk here of the many excellent articles in the Bill of Rights; &s;uch as religious toleration,&mdash;the habeas corpus act,&mdash;trials by juries,&mdash;the rotation of office, &amp;c. None of them can flouri&s;h long in the neighbourhood of a &s;ingle A&s;&s;embly, and a Council of Cen&s;ors po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing all the powers of the State.&mdash;The&s;e ine&s;timable privileges in the Con&s;titution of Penn&s;ylvania re&s;emble a tree loaded with the mo&s;t lu&s;cious fruit, but &s;urrounded with thorns, in &s;uch a manner, as to be for ever inacce&s;&s;ible to the hungry traveller.</P>
<P>Perhaps, while the government is upon its good behaviour, and
<PB N="20" REF="015589_0019_0F998ED69C2D3220">
while the pa&s;&s;ions of the State are directed again&s;t a cruel and common enemy, we may not experience all the calamities that have been de|mon&s;trated to flow from the Con&s;titution.&mdash;But the revolution of a few years, and the return of peace, will mo&s;t certainly render Penn|&s;ylvania, under her pre&s;ent Con&s;titution, the mo&s;t mi&s;erable &s;pot upon the &s;urface of the globe.</P>
<P>I believe all the Members of the late Convention were true Whigs, and aimed &s;incerely at forming a free and happy government: But, I am &s;ure, that if Filmar and Hobbes had &s;at among them, they could not have formed a government more destructive of human happine&s;s; nor could Lord North or General Howe have formed one more de|&s;tructive of union and vigour, in our public affairs, than the pre&s;ent Con&s;titution of Penn&s;ylvania.</P>
<P>It is one thing to under&s;tand the <HI>principles,</HI> and another thing to under&s;tand the <HI>forms</HI> of government. The former are &s;imple; the latter are difficult and complicated. There is the &s;ame difference be|tween principles and forms in all other &s;ciences. Who under&s;tood the principles of mechanics and optics better than Sir I&s;aac Newton? and yet Sir I&s;aac could not for his life have made a watch or a micro&s;cope.

<HEAD>LETTER IV.</HEAD>
<P>A Que&s;tion very naturally ari&s;es from taking a review of the tyranny of the government of Penn&s;ylvania, What mea&s;ures &s;hall be taken to amend them? There can be but two an&s;wers to this que&s;tion. 1&s;t. To &s;ubmit to the Con&s;titution for the pre&s;ent, till a peace with Great-Britain will give us lei&s;ure to make a better; or, 2dly, to call a Convention immediately for the purpo&s;e of making a new Con&s;titution. I believe the State is divided only about the&s;e two things; for the party who believe the government to be a <HI>good</HI> one, is too incon&s;iderable to be noticed in this place.</P>
<P>I. I beg leave to offer a few objections to our <HI>&s;ubmitting</HI> to the Con|&s;titution, and &s;hall endeavour, II. to obviate the objections that have been made to the immediate calling of a Convention, for the purpo&s;e of altering and amending it.</P>
<P>I. There is the utmo&s;t danger to the State of Penn&s;ylvania to a tem|porary &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the Con&s;titution from the following cau&s;es, 1. The government is a tyranny. The moment we &s;ubmit to it we become &s;laves. We hold every thing dear to us in &s;ociety upon the tenure of the will of a &s;ingle man in a &s;ingle A&s;&s;embly. Perhaps the mark of the bea&s;t may not be fixed immediately upon us, but the contract is made, and we are &s;old, together with our po&s;terity, the hewers of wood and drawers of water for ever. 2. The Con&s;titution cannot be executed in part without being <HI>broken.</HI> Now there cannot be a more dangerous precedent in a free country, than a legi&s;lature violating in a

&s;ingle article even the <HI>forms</HI> of a Con&s;titution. 3 The pre&s;ent govern|ment will not draw forth the wi&s;dom nor &s;trength of the State, nor afford that a&s;&s;i&s;tance to our <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> States which is expected from us in the pre|&s;ent <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> Great Britain.

There is not force enough in the <HI>whole</HI> State to draw taxes from a &s;ingle county again&s;t their con&s;ent.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The gentlemen in the oppo&s;ition to the government have con&s;tantly prayed, that the Con&s;titution might be referred to the arbitration of a Con|vention, and have declared their willingne&s;s to &s;ubmit to, or concur in the execution of it, if it &s;hould be confirmed by a repre&s;entation of the people <HI>fairly</HI> cho&s;en. I am &s;orry to find upon the Journals of the A&s;&s;embly, an addre&s;s from a battalion of militia in Che&s;ter county, to the Honourable Hou&s;e, a&s;&s;uring them, that "they will &s;upport the pre&s;ent government with their lives and fortunes." Such addre&s;&s;es indicated the weakne&s;s, and foreboded the pre&s;ent contemptible &s;ituation of the court of Britain. They were pre&s;ented in times &s;imilar <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> our own, viz. when the American colonies were upon their knees to the throne, praying to be governed by their own repre&s;entatives, and to be delivered from <HI>IMPENDING</HI> &s;lavery. But it is characteri&s;tic of the pre&s;ent Con&s;titution, that, in the fir&s;t year of it, exe|cution, the journals of our rulers were &s;tained with threats of blood&s;hed again&s;t men who only petitioned for a redre&s;s of grievances.</NOTE> Alas! we are <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the brink of ruin. Our State has lifted a knife to her throat, and is about to undo her&s;elf by a ha&s;ty and ill-judged exerci&s;e of her own power. Our enemies are exulting, and our friends are weeping over our alarming &s;ituation. Our ance&s;tors look down, and our po&s;terity look up to us for a happier Con&s;titution. We are engaged with our Si&s;ter States in 2 bloody and expen&s;ive war. The liberty of the whole world is the price for which we fight. Human nature looks to us to avenge the mighty ills &s;he has &s;uffered from the tyrants of the old world. She has already dropped a tear of joy upon the pro&s;pect of recovering among us her fir&s;t and original dignity. A <HI>good government</HI> is an engine not le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to en&s;ure us &s;ucce&s;s in the&s;e glorious purpo&s;es than ammunition and <HI>fire-arms.</HI> The way of duty is plain. Let a Convention be cho&s;en, to alter and amend the government. This mea&s;ure alone will re&s;tore vigor and union to Penn|&s;ylvania. Say not, my dear countrymen, THIS IS NOT THE TIME, THE ENEMY ARE AT OUR GATES, LET US FIRST REPEL THEM. Look at our militia on a field day&mdash;&s;ee the attempts of the friends to the Con&s;titution to open our courts&mdash;hear the complaints and mur|murs of the people. They all proclaim that NOW is the time for alter|ing our Con&s;titution. No confu&s;ion can ari&s;e from It. The gentlemen in the oppo&s;ition declare their determination to &s;upport the pre&s;ent A&s;&s;embly in the execution of every law nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;afety and de|fence
<PB N="22" REF="015589_0021_0F998ED88BA5A8B0">
of the State, and above all in the execution of the militia and te&s;t laws. They have no intere&s;t unconnected with yours. They &s;ee with the &s;ame di&s;tre&s;s as you do the Tories triumphing in our di&s;union. Be not deceived. The Tories are not enemies to the pre&s;ent government; they enjoy the benefits of its weakne&s;s, and there is good authority to &s;ay they have <HI>&s;ecretly</HI> helped to carry it into execution. Let us beware of being impo&s;ed upon by the popular cry of the <HI>nece&s;&s;ity of the times.</HI> When the Di&s;&s;enters in Virginia and South Carolina prayed for the abolition of the Epi&s;copal e&s;tabli&s;hment in tho&s;e States, the High-Churchmen acknowledged that their demands were ju&s;t, but &s;aid, that <HI>this was not the time</HI> for attending to them, and that &s;uch a change in the government would throw all things into confu&s;ion. The demands were notwith&s;tanding complied with, and an union unparalleled in for|mer times was immediately produced in tho&s;e Spates. When a decla|ration of independance la&s;t &s;ummer appeared to be the only mea&s;ure that could &s;ave America, the Tories and moderate men acknowledged the ju&s;tice of our &s;eparation from Great-Britain, but &s;aid, "This is not the time." The event &s;hewed that the time was come, for, ex|clu&s;ive of the advantages we have gained from it in foreign Courts, it &s;erved to precipitate the timid, the doubtful and the di&s;affected cha|racters from their mixture with the real Whigs, and although it le&s;&s;ened the numbers in the oppo&s;ition, it added to their &s;trength by producing union and deci&s;ion among them. To delay ju&s;tice (has been emphatically &s;aid) is to deny it. In like manner to <HI>delay</HI> liberty is to <HI>take</HI> it away.</P>
<P>The Convention of New-York formed their government within the reach of the thunder of the enemy's cannon, and while one half of their State was in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Is our situation more dangerous than it was la&s;t year? The members of the late Convention were cho&s;en on a day when the A&s;&s;ociators of the whole State were in motion. The Con&s;titution was made while above 5000 of them were in the field. The &s;en&s;e of the people was not <HI>a&s;ked</HI> upon the &s;ubject of the Con|&s;titution; but it was <HI>given</HI> in the mo&s;t public manner. No more than 1500 freemen voted for its being executed, for that number only took the oath of allegiance to the Con&s;titution at the election in Octo|ber. Let us talk no more then of the "<HI>necessity of the times.</HI>" This is the State apology at St. James's for all the crimes of the pre&s;ent reign and for all the &s;avages and blood&s;hed we have witne&s;&s;ed in America. The State of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay are preparing for an inva&s;ion; they expect General Burgoyne every hour in their harbours with a powerful army, and yet in a Bo&s;ton paper, of the 5th of May, I find the follow|ing re&s;olution of their A&s;&s;embly and Council,</P>

<P>But further, recollect, my dear countrymen, our conduct upon read|ing the re&s;olution of the Honourable Congre&s;s of the 15th of May, 1776. We &s;eized it as a Warrant that proclaimed liberty to us and our po|&s;terity for ever. It was &s;aid by &s;ome people at that time, "Let the A&s;&s;embly execute that re&s;olution;" but we &s;purned the advice, and we acted like men. We &s;aid, that the "A&s;&s;embly was not cho&s;en by a majority of votes in the State," owing to the inequality of our repre|&s;entation, and that they wanted the "confidence of the people." We thought nothing then of the lo&s;s of time occa&s;ioned by the meeting of a Conference of Committees, to &s;ettle the mode and time of chu&s;ing a Convention.

If I have laboured in vain, I &s;hall henceforth mourn in &s;ecret only over my beloved country, and lament the day that I was born a Penn&s;ylvanian.</P>
