<P>_WILLIAM GLANVILLE, <ABBR>E&s;q;</ABBR> one of the chief clerks of the Trea&s;ury left your Lord&s;hip a legacy, in his la&s;t will; and a few hours before his death, was plea&s;ed to a&s;&s;ign the following rea&s;ons for it.</P>

<P>As to the legacy I have given to the Lord-Bi&s;hop of Bangor, I declare the &s;ame to be in te&s;timony of the re&s;pect I bear him, in defending the liberty of his coun|try; and for his love to mankind; and for his endea|vouring to free religion from &s;uper&s;tition and tyranny, (which worldly intere&s;t and ambition have blended with it) and to re&s;tore it to that &s;implicity and u&s;eful|ne&s;s which was the de&s;ign of its ble&s;&s;ed Author: For which his labour of love, he has ju&s;tly merited the e&s;teem and regard of all good men, in&s;tead of that load of infamy and &s;candal, which the pa&s;&s;ions of de&s;igning men have &s;o maliciou&s;ly and uncharitably thrown up|on him.</P>

<P>Here your Lord&s;hip and the world &s;ee the real &s;enti|ments of a Gentleman of great honour, &s;en&s;e, and vir|tue, at a time of the &s;tricte&s;t &s;incerity. And I beg leave
<PB N="iv" REF="012728_0004_0F91400194861EB0">
publicly to declare, that I have no other rea&s;on in the world for affixing your great and venerable name to the following papers, than tho&s;e a&s;&s;igned by the worthy Gen|tleman before-mentioned: Being utterly unbia&s;&s;ed by any &s;uch motives as u&s;ually produce Dedications to great men. And I per&s;uade my&s;elf, it cannot be unacceptable to your Lord&s;hip, to be the patron of a book, the only de&s;ign of which is, to &s;erve and vindicate the civil and religious liberties of mankind.</P>
<P>And here, according to the u&s;ual &s;tile and purpo&s;e of dedications, it may be expected I &s;hould launch out into a panegyric on your great and excellent qualities: And, indeed, being a lay-man, and having not the lea&s;t de|pendance on your Lord&s;hip, I might, in that ca&s;e, be pre&s;umed to &s;peak to you, and of you, with the freedom of an indifferent man, and without ri&s;king that cen&s;ure which is &s;o generally incurred by Dedicators.&mdash;But the exhibiting your Lord&s;hip's amiable character, requires an abler pen: It is a &s;ubject too nice and delicate for me to attempt: Be&s;ides, it can receive no advantage from any private man; as it &s;tands immoveably fixed, beyond the reach of party or of &s;action, on records that will re|main until time &s;hall be no more.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip, at your fir&s;t &s;etting out in the world, was plea&s;ed to lay a&s;ide the unintelligible jargon of the &s;chools, in matters of religion, and to declare openly and freely in favour of the New-Te&s;tament and common &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>And as to matters of Government, you ever appeared a &s;trenuous a&s;&s;erter of tho&s;e noble principles; whereby the Revolution was brought about, under the late King William, who&s;e memory will be always dear to every Briton, that has the lea&s;t regard for hone&s;ty, rea&s;on, or ju&s;tice. Tho&s;e religious and political principles, your Lord&s;hip was plea&s;ed to defend and maintain, by argu|ments founded on truth, and &s;uperior to all the wicked &s;ophi&s;try of your adver&s;aries.</P>
<P>When mercenary &s;cribblers are employed by a party, to vent their malice, it may be fit to leave them to the cour&s;e of common ju&s;tice; but here the trumper <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ounded in Zion, the pulpit gave the alarm: tho&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> profe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves Amba&s;&s;adors of peace, breathed no|thing

but war; they attacked you with unappea&s;ible &s;u|ry, but covered their outrage with the &s;pecious names of Loyalty, Religion, and the Church; where by the de|luded populace were drawn to inli&s;t under their banners, in contradiction to their own mo&s;t valuable rights, both as men and Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>This, my Lord, was the ca&s;e with re&s;pect to you, and to tho&s;e truly rational and even divine principles you &s;o bravely defended; when the high court of Parliament thought it nece&s;&s;ary to interpo&s;e in favour of your Lord|&s;hip; whom, with &s;urprize and a&s;toni&s;hment, they &s;aw thus iniquitou&s;ly per&s;ecuted by many Reverend Doctors and Dignitaries, and for no other rea&s;on than for your open and hearty attachment to our Religion, Laws, and Government.</P>
<P>This illu&s;trious A&s;&s;embly determined, by a public act, to te&s;tify to the Sovereign, and to the whole nation, their re&s;entment of your ill u&s;age, and the &s;en&s;e they had of your extraordinary merit. For this purpo&s;e, a motion was made by the ingenious Anthony Henly, <ABBR>E&s;q;</ABBR> and, after a &s;hort debate, the Hou&s;e came to the following re&s;olution:</P>
<Q>That the Rev. Mr. Benjamin Hoadly, Rector of St. Peter's Poor, London, for having &s;trenuou&s;ly ju&s;ti|fied the principles on which her Maje&s;ty and the na|tion proceeded, in the late happy revolution, had ju&s;t|ly merited the favour of this hou&s;e; and that an humble Addre&s;s be pre&s;ented to her Maje&s;ty, that &s;he would be graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to be&s;tow &s;ome dignity in the Church, on the &s;aid Mr. Hoadly, for his eminent &s;ervices in the Church and State.</Q>
<P>The Queen's an&s;wer was:</P>
<Q>I will take a proper opportunity to comply with your reque&s;t.</Q>
<P>A greater honour, your Lord&s;hip could never have re|ceived; as it was the approbation of your country, de|clared by its repre&s;entatives, one of the mo&s;t augu&s;t A&s;|&s;emblies upon earth, and which will remain, in the re|cords thereof, an eternal monument to your renown: A monument, more glorious and la&s;ting, than pillars of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, or triumphal arches!</P>
<P>For &s;ome time after this your Lord&s;hip had a re&s;pite
<PB N="vi" REF="012728_0006_0F91400783379BC0">
from your eccle&s;ia&s;tical adver&s;aries. It &s;eemed as if they were thunder-&s;truck by this noble re&s;olution. However, it was not long, before the&s;e di&s;turbers of our peace, the&s;e &s;worn enemies of Briti&s;h liberty, received a fre&s;h provo|cation, in a &s;ermon preached before the King, at St. James's, and publi&s;hed by his &s;pecial command, entit|led, THE NATURE OF THE KINGDOM OF CHRIST. Herein you had proved, beyond all rea&s;onable contra|diction, that Chri&s;t's kingdom was not of this world: A doctrine new and &s;urpri&s;ing, even to the greate&s;t part of the clergy.&mdash;What now could your Lord&s;hip expect but judgment without mercy!&mdash;It was a crime of &s;uch a na|ture, as never to be forgiven. To be told that Chri&s;t's kingdom did not con&s;i&s;t in mitres, lord&s;hips, deanaries, ve&s;tments, ceremonies, &s;piritual courts, ab&s;olutions, per|&s;ecutions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&mdash;It was next to the &s;in again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t, and for which your adver&s;aries will never forgive you, either in this world or the next.</P>
<P>Here your enemies lo&s;t all patience; and, in&s;tead of rea&s;on and argument, di&s;charged again&s;t you their whole artillery of affronts and indignities: Notwith&s;tanding the greate&s;t and be&s;t men in the kingdom acknowledged that your Lord&s;hip's principles, both civil and religious, were for the benefit of human &s;ociety, agreeable to the natural rights of mankind, and perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with the New-Te&s;tament, the Reformation, and the church of England.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip's enemies did not intend things &s;hould &s;top here.&mdash;The lower hou&s;e of Convocation appointed a committee, con&s;i&s;ting of Dr. Mo&s;s, Dr. Sherlock, Dr. Friend, Dr. Spratt, Dr. Cannan, and Dr. By&s;e, to draw up a repre&s;entation, to be laid before the upper hou&s;e, concerning &s;everal dangerous po&s;itions advanced by your Lord&s;hip, at that time Bi&s;hop of Bangor; which repre|&s;entation was approved of by the lower hou&s;e, and was voted to be entered on their books, <HI>nem. con.</HI>&mdash;The atten|tion of the public was again engaged, and per&s;ons of the highe&s;t rank were extremely &s;olicitous for your protection.</P>
<P>And here, al&s;o, your Lord&s;hip had the honour to here one of the be&s;t, the wi&s;e&s;t, and brave&s;t men that ever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> world produced, appear in your behalf; I mean the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> KING GEORGE, who was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed, by his royal

writ to the Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, to prorogue the Convocation; whereby the de&s;igns of your enemies were at once defeated. A noble in&s;tance of Royal ju&s;tice and paternal affection to his &s;ubjects! A &s;trange phaenomenon in the political world! A Monarch exerting him&s;elf in defence of his &s;ubjects liberties, which multitudes of them&s;elves were eager to betray! An example highly de&s;erving the imitation of every Sovereign, but hardly to be paralleled. His generous &s;oul was influenced by all tho&s;e &s;entiments of humanity and compa&s;&s;ion, with which Chri&s;tianity never fails to in&s;pire its real votaries. He could not forbear, voluntarily and una&s;ked, to inter|po&s;e in behalf of an innocent and abu&s;ed &s;ubject. This &s;ingle in&s;tance of his Royal virtue will ever be recorded in the Briti&s;h annals, to his immortal honour; for which generations to come will call him ble&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>I cannot conclude without taking &s;ome notice of a late hone&s;t performance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Plain Account.</NOTE> of your Lord&s;hip's, which has again drawn upon you the unju&s;t attacks of the bigots of all parties. Your Lord&s;hip could expect nothing le&s;s:&mdash;Its natural de&s;ign and tendency being to beat down my&s;tery, bigotry, &s;uper&s;tition and non&s;en&s;e; which have been for &s;o many ages, the grand &s;upport of the &s;acerdotal empire. What wonder, then, if your Lord&s;hip &s;u&s;tained a fre&s;h torrent of abu&s;e on this occa&s;ion. I have read ma|ny of the an&s;wers to this valuable treati&s;e; but have found none of them meriting your Lord&s;hip's ob&s;ervation. In oppo&s;ition to all the&s;e exertions of &s;currility; I could produce, if it were nece&s;&s;ary, the &s;entiments of the be&s;t and greate&s;t men that the pre&s;ent age has produced in favour of your Lord&s;hip's character and principles. But I &s;hall content my&s;elf with what the learned and pious Dr. Tenni&s;on was plea&s;ed to advance, in his prote&s;t again&s;t the report of the Convocation, in the ca&s;e of your Lord|&s;hip. I have read it often, and never without a &s;ecret plea&s;ure. It breathes forth nothing but piety, charity, and New-Te&s;tament religion:</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>REVEREND SIR!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_IT is not of vanity, lucre or party, that I now &s;it down to make &s;ome remarks on your late very extraordinary &s;ermon. I mu&s;t confe&s;s I have read &s;ome other notable ones, and heard many more, on this occa&s;ion; but none &s;o de&s;erving or public contempt and cen&s;ure. Your whole performance could be calculated with no other view, than to revive old heats and animo&s;ities, and to rai&s;e that &s;pirit of &s;trife and di&s;cord, which, as a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel of peace, it is your peculiar province to &s;uppre&s;s.</P>
<P>I know of nothing more repugnant to the &s;pirit of Chri&s;tianity, than for one, profe&s;&s;ing to preach it, to &s;et up for the champion of a party; &s;ince parties are for the mo&s;t part influenced by motives mean and brutal, incon&s;i&s;tent with that unalterable regard to truth and ju&s;tice, to which all men and all parties have an invio|lable claim.</P>
<P>I hope you will not be offended, if, in this addre&s;s, I &s;peak my &s;entiments plainly. And though I &s;hall not fail of doing &s;o, yet, notwith&s;tanding the provocation you have given, my intention is to treat you with the civility due to your function, without pa&s;&s;ion, or per&s;onal reproach. And if you are not very much prejudiced by a blind and &s;erious ze<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">l, I per&s;uade my&s;elf, I &s;hall in &s;ome degree en|lighten your under&s;tanding and awaken your con&s;cience;
<PB N="10" REF="012728_0010_0F94DD287B1F8750">
not by fal&s;hood and di&s;gui&s;es, but by facts; facts that are inconte&s;table, and that will argue for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I would take up too much of my time to enter upon all the particular fal&s;ities, ab&s;urdities, and fallacious rea|&s;onings, of which your &s;ermon was made up. I &s;hall only offer the following general remarks to your con&s;ideration; intreating you to peru&s;e them calmly, without any party|&s;pirit, dive&s;ted of all prejudice and partiality, with a tem|per and di&s;po&s;ition of mind becoming a Gentleman and a &s;cholar, always determined to &s;ubmit to the force of truth and evidence: And then your own con&s;cience will pre&s;ently &s;ugge&s;t to you, that your whole &s;ermon was a manife&s;t contradiction to the religion, laws, government, and true hi&s;tory of your country.</P>
<P>The exalted character you was plea&s;ed to give of King Charles I. made a very con&s;iderable part of your di&s;|cour&s;e. I mu&s;t acknowledge, it was &s;peciou&s;ly drawn, and delivered with an engaging elocution and empha&s;is; but it had this unlucky circum&s;tance attending it, that the picture had no affinity with the original: Light and darkne&s;s, heaven and hell, could not po&s;&s;ibly be more oppo&s;ite to each other, than your portrait was to the real character of that unhappy Prince. Therefore, permit me, Sir, in my turn, to give you his true and genuine character; which, at this di&s;tance of time can only be done, by an impartial recital of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable and important actions of his life.</P>
<P>During the minority of this Prince he was looked on, by all that knew him, to be of a mo&s;t ob&s;tinate di&s;po&s;i|tion. His mother greatly lamented his unhappy turn of mind, and was heard to &s;ay of him in public, that <Q>&s;he feared he would live to be the ruin of him&s;elf, and oc|ca&s;ion the lo&s;s of his three kingdoms by his ob&s;tinacy.</Q> Soon after he came to the throne, he married a French Papi&s;t, by a di&s;pen&s;ation from the Pope, and according to the ceremonies of the church of Rome. She was not only a Papi&s;t, but in a remarkable manner attached to all the fopperies and mo&s;t ab&s;urd practices of that church. By the articles of this marriage, many liberties were granted to the Papi&s;ts. A chapel was permitted to be built at Sommer&s;et-hou&s;e, where there was likewi&s;e e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
<PB N="11" REF="012728_0011_0F94DD293A462AC8">
a convent of Capuchin-Friars, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> together with a great number of Prie&s;ts and Je&s;uits, walked the &s;treets in their habits, in &s;uch a manner as had never been al|lowed &s;ince the Reformation. The King wrote to the Pope with the title of Mo&s;t Holy Father.</P>
<P>All the hone&s;t and wi&s;e part of the nation was greatly alarmed at this match; fearing it would again bring us back to the &s;lavery and bondage of Rome. King Charles I. was a &s;taunch bigot, and con&s;equently the darling of the Clergy; and having no great reach of his own, was governed by his Prie&s;ts, who have always been unfortunate when they meddle in politics. His whole reign was one continued &s;eries of follies, or infringement of the rights of his &s;ubjects. He lived in the con&s;tant and open viola|tion of the fundamental laws of the realm; and conduct|ed every thing to the di&s;honour and reproach of the Eng|li&s;h nation. But to de&s;cend to particulars.</P>
<P>He agreed with the Marquis D'Effiat, the French Mi|ni&s;ter, for a &s;quadron of men of war, to join the French fleet at Dieppe, which was fitting out again&s;t the Prote&s;|tants at Rochelle: Thereby to de&s;troy at once all the re|maining &s;trength of the Reformed in that kingdom. The command of this &s;quadron was given to Captain Penning|ton, whom he &s;trictly enjoined, that in ca&s;e his &s;hips &s;hould refu&s;e to join the French, in this vile expedition, he &s;hould u&s;e all forcible means to compel them, even to the &s;inking them, if they continued o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tinate: That was, to de&s;troy the Engli&s;h his own people, if they would not de&s;troy the French Prote&s;tants.</P>
<P>This conduct appears by far the more wicked and a&s;toni&s;hing, as the King a little before had wrote two let|ters, &s;igned Charles <HI>Rex,</HI> to the Peers, Burghers, and in|habitants of the city of Rochelle, engaging to a&s;&s;i&s;t them to the utmo&s;t. In the fir&s;t letter he &s;ays, <Q>My fleet &s;hall peri&s;h rather than you &s;hall not be relieved.</Q> In the &s;econd; <Q>Be a&s;&s;ured I will never abandon you, and that I will employ all the force of my kingdom for your deliverance.</Q></P>
<P>When the Parliament came afterwards to examine Pen|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">on's papers, they found a letter from the King, &s;igned Charles <HI>Rex,</HI> <Q>Requiring him to di&s;po&s;e of tho&s;e

<P>On this proceeding, General Ludlow has this plain re|mark, <Q>By this horrible treachery the &s;trong town of Rochelle, wherein the &s;ecurity of the Prote&s;tants of France chiefly con&s;i&s;ted, was delivered up to the Pa|pi&s;ts; and tho&s;e of the Reformed religion in all parts of the kingdom expo&s;ed to the rage of their cruel and bloody enemies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Memoirs, vol. I. page 5.</NOTE> Again: King James was &s;trongly bent to render him&s;elf ab&s;olute; yet he cho&s;e rather to carry on that de&s;ign by fraud than violence; but King Charles immediately after his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne, pulled of the ma&s;k and openly di&s;covered his intention to make the crown ab&s;olute and independent; and the Queen, on her part, pre&s;&s;ed him on all occa&s;ions, to p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">r&s;ue the de&s;ign of enlarging his power, and to mould the church of England to a nearer compliance to the See of Rome.</Q> At the &s;ame time, this Prince &s;ent a decla|ration to the Lord-keeper, for granting full liberty and toleration to all Papi&s;ts, notwith&s;tanding the extreme ri|gour of the then laws again&s;t them. Upon &s;ome of the Privy Council advi&s;ing him again&s;t this illegal &s;tep, he openly replied, That it was his will tho&s;e laws &s;hould &s;tand di&s;charged.</P>
<P>Thus, almo&s;t in the fir&s;t month of his reign, he &s;et up a de&s;potic power again&s;t the con&s;titution. He granted a general pard<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> to all Papi&s;ts, under pro&s;ecution; not on|ly as Papi&s;ts, but as criminals. He relea&s;ed twenty Prie&s;ts from goal. And it now evidently appeared, that he in|tended to rule and govern all by ab&s;olute will and plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The Parliament began to be greatly alarmed by the&s;e mea&s;ures, and prote&s;ted in form again&s;t them. They remon&s;trated.</P>
<P N="1">1. His protecting a &s;editious, virulent and ignorant Prie&s;t, Richard Montague, in oppo&s;ition to the &s;en&s;e of the Parliament.</P>

<P N="3">3. The war again&s;t Spain, without a declaration; and the &s;ending to de&s;troy the Prote&s;tants of Rochelle.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="13" REF="012728_0013_0F94DD2ABA3F6850">
4. The total mi&s;-employment of three &s;ub&s;idies, and three fifteenths. With many other enormities, too tedi|ous to relate.</P>
<P>This Montague wrote a book, entitled, <HI>Apello Coe&s;a|rem,</HI> wherein he advanced the following po&s;itions:</P>
<P N="1">1. That the church of Rome is, and ever was a true church.</P>
<P N="2">2. That images might be u&s;ed to excite devotion.</P>
<P N="3">3. That &s;aints have patronage, cu&s;tody, protection, and power, over certain per&s;ons and things, as the angels have.</P>
<P>This book gave great offence unto all true Prote&s;tants. The Parliament condemned it, and &s;ummoned Montague to attend at their bar; and voted his book to be contra|ry to the articles e&s;tabli&s;hed by Parliament, to tend to the King's di&s;honour, and the di&s;turbance of the church; and obliged him to enter into a bond of 2000 l. to ap|pear again on the next &s;ummons.</P>
<P>However, notwith&s;tanding this book was &s;o publicly condemned by the Parliament, as well as by the general voice and &s;uffrage of the kingdom, yet at Court it met with applau&s;e and high encomiums; and the Author was rewarded in&s;tantly with the Bi&s;hoprick of Chiche&s;ter, and &s;oon after was tran&s;lated to Norwich: Whereby the King again openly declared his encouragement of Po|pery; and that whoever, in contempt of the Parliament and con&s;titution of England, would a&s;&s;ert a de&s;poti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> power in church and &s;tate, might expect to be rewarded.</P>
<P>Thus, in the beginning of his reign, he lo&s;t the hearts and affections of a great part of his &s;ubjects. What con|tributed to increa&s;e the general murmuring and di&s;con|tent, was his illegal and arbitrary treatment of a great number of leading men of both Hou&s;es of Parliament. Sir John Elliot, a famous Speaker in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, was committed clo&s;e pri&s;oner to the Gate-hou&s;e, with many others. The pretence was, for undutiful &s;peech. The Commons p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ed a vote to vindicate all their members at once; declaring there had been no undutiful &s;peech in that Hou&s;e, from the beginning of the Parlia|ment to that day. Sir Dudly Diggs, another top &s;peaker in the Hou&s;e of Commons, was hurried away to the Tower, under the pretence al&s;o of undutiful &s;peech, at a late public conference with the Lords.

<P>Notwith&s;tanding this public atte&s;tation of his inno|cence by To many Peers, to the Tower he mu&s;t go, right or wrong. Innocence in tho&s;e days was no &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>All this was done contrary to the opinion of the Judges, who declared, That &s;uch a violent re&s;traint on &s;o many members, was a public arre&s;t on the whole body of Parliament.</P>
<P>The King, by a me&s;&s;age to the Earls of Bri&s;tol and Arundell, forbad them to attend the Hou&s;e of Lords; and &s;oon after committed the latter to the Tower. This made a mighty ferment. All the Peers began now to look on their per&s;ons and e&s;tates to be in great danger. They petitioned his Maje&s;ty in a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive manner, humbly be&s;eeching, <Q>That the Earl of Arundell, a Member of their Hou&s;e, might be re&s;tored to them again; and that the &s;ame regard might he had to the rights and privileges of the Peers as had ever been.</Q></P>
<P>The King gave a rough an&s;wer, and would not di&s;|charge him. This produced a long and well-penned re|mon&s;trance. The Lords exerted them&s;elves on this occa&s;ion with a becoming &s;pirit; they petitioned the King again and again, five different times, and came to the following remarkable re&s;olution, <HI>nemine contradicent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI>

"That no Lord of Parliament, the Parliament &s;itting, or within the u&s;ual time of the privilege of Parliament, is to be impri&s;oned or re&s;trained, without &s;entence or or|der of the Hou&s;e; unle&s;s it be for trea&s;on or felony, or for refu&s;ing to give &s;ecurity for the peace; and that, <HI>una voce,</HI> this is the undoubted right of the Peers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, p. 365.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>Things continued for a con&s;iderable time in this &s;itu|ation; the King committed many of the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, and daily breaking in upon tho&s;e rights and pri|vileges of the Hou&s;e of Lords, which for a long time had been held &s;acred and inviolable, till at la&s;t he grew tired with frequent petitions and remon&s;trances of both Hou&s;es, in vindication of their ju&s;t and legal rights: Wherefore, the better to e&s;tabli&s;h his ab&s;olute power and dominion over the lives and properties of his &s;ubjects, he determined to have no Parliament at all; and &s;ent a me&s;|&s;age to the Hou&s;e of Lords, &s;ignifying his intention to di&s;&s;olve the Parliament, then &s;itting, in&s;tantly.</P>
<P>This alarmed both Hou&s;es, more than any thing that had yet happened; and they were under terrible appre|hen&s;ions of the con&s;equences that might en&s;ue &s;uch a pe|remptory and &s;udden di&s;&s;olution, at &s;o critical a juncture.</P>
<P>The Lords, the &s;ame morning, &s;ent a petition to the King, affirming, <Q>That they were really and truly his mo&s;t faithful and loyal &s;ubjects; and that as they were al&s;o his Maje&s;ty's hereditary council of the king|dom, they were obliged by the duty they owed to God, his Maje&s;ty, and their country, humbly to offer their advice, that the Parliament may be continued for &s;ome time longer, whereby great and apparent dangers may be prevented, and his Maje&s;ty made happy in the du|ty and love of his people.</Q> This hone&s;t and memorable petition was delivered by the Lord Vi&s;count Mandeville, the Earl of Manche&s;ter, Lord-Pre&s;ident of his Maje&s;ty's Council, the Earl of Pembroke, the Earl of Carli&s;le, and the Earl of Holland. The King returned for an&s;wer, <Q>That he would hear no motion, but would di&s;&s;olve the Parliament, and immediately cau&s;e a commi&s;&s;ion to pa&s;s the Great Seal for that purpo&s;e<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ib. p. 398.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>But the King would not &s;top here; for, the day fol|lowing,
<PB N="16" REF="012728_0016_0F94DD2D03C4F740">
warrants were directed from the privy-council to apprehend &s;everal members of Parliament, as Denzil Hollis, <ABBR>E&s;q;</ABBR> Sir Miles Hobert, Sir Peter Hayman; John Selden, <ABBR>E&s;q;</ABBR> Corrington, Long, Stroud, Valentine, and &s;ome others; all leading men in the Hou&s;e of Commons. Mo&s;t of them were apprehended and committed clo&s;e pri&s;oners to the Tower.</P>
<P>Having in &s;o unprecedented a way di&s;&s;olved this Par|liament, and calling no other during the twelve follow|ing years, he in that long period governed as arbitrarily as the Grand Seignior, and in a manner &s;ubver&s;ive of all the laws and con&s;titution of this realm. In the fir&s;t &s;even years of this time, he publi&s;hed no le&s;s than one hundred and forty-&s;ix proclamations: The chief de&s;ign of which was to rai&s;e money without con&s;ent or authority of Par|liament, under the denomination of conduct-money, tunnage, poundage, &s;hip-money, &amp;c.&amp;c.</P>
<P>Great numbers among&s;t the nobility and principal gentry, who had hitherto adhered to the King, began daily to fall off, and to de&s;ert the Court. Nothing was heard of but grievances and remon&s;trances; and per&s;ons of great note began publicly to declare, that the govern|ment was illegal and arbitrary, and that the con&s;titution was actually de&s;troyed. Many about the King had the hone&s;ty and courage to point out to him the unavoidable con&s;equences of tho&s;e wicked and violent mea&s;ures. Sir Robert Cotton repeatedly told him in council, That what|ever rea&s;ons may be given for it, the nation would not hear the levying money without con&s;ent of Parliament; and that every tax not authorized thereby, was breaking in upon the con&s;titution, and e&s;teemed by the people of England as an act of tyr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nny, and impo&s;ing of &s;ervitude.</P>
<P>This wi&s;e and prudent advice did not &s;uit the temper of King Charles. He had nothing in his head or heart, but ab&s;olute rule and government.</P>
<P>I may here remark, that the mi&s;chiefs and mi&s;ery of this reign, mu&s;t, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, be imputed to that haughty eccle&s;ia&s;tic Archbi&s;hop Laud, and his creatures. They di&s;&s;uaded the King from all moderate mea&s;ures; and pretended, that by their authority and influence they would greatly promote his de&s;ign of plundering his &s;ub|jects,
<PB N="17" REF="012728_0017_0F94DD2DC33DE908">
(which is certainly done, when their money is taken by force, without law and con&s;ent of Parliament) and, to do them ju&s;tice, they laboured at it heartily.</P>
<P>One Manwaring undertook to prove out of the Scrip|ture, <Q>That Kings might impo&s;e taxes without con&s;ent of Parliament, and that the people were bound in con|&s;cience to obey their will and plea&s;ure.</Q> Laud &s;ent an|other pa a&s;itical prie&s;t (one Sibthorp) to preach an a&s;&s;iz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ermon at Northampton, wherein he a&s;&s;erted, <Q>That the King is not bound to ob&s;erve the laws of the realm concerning the &s;ubjects rights and liberties, and that his Royal will in impo&s;ing taxes without con&s;ent of Parliament, binds his &s;ubjects on pain of damnation; and that tho&s;e who refu&s;e to pay the loans offend God, and become guilty of di&s;loyalty and rebellion.</Q> This wretched &s;ycophant, in&s;tead of being puni&s;hed for this wicked and and impious doctrine, was rewarded with a bi&s;hoprick. All the &s;ermons now at Court were to the &s;ame purpo&s;e.&mdash;Ludlow tells us, <Q>this was the only work of which the clergy was judg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d capable; and therefore, divers of them entered the li&s;t as champions of the pre|rogative, a&s;&s;erting, that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and e&s;tates of the &s;ubject d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d of right belong to the King; and that he might di&s;po&s;e of them at his plea&s;ure: Thereby annulling, as much as in them lay, all the laws of England that &s;ecure property to the people<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. I. p. 5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>But the King &s;oon found that the Clergy might con|tinue their preaching to eternity, without bringing any money into the Exchequer, and therefore more violent methods were taken. He began with impri&s;oning a great number of the fir&s;t rank and quality, as well as many eminent merchants and traders in London and el&s;ewhere, for refu&s;ing to pay tho&s;e illegal taxes.</P>

<P>Were it nece&s;&s;ary, I could mention a hundred flagrant in&s;tances more, to prove that the Government of King Charles I. for many years was illegal, arbitrary, and ty|rannical, and that the con&s;titution was actually &s;ubverted and de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>The King began now to look upon him&s;elf as &s;ecure, and to imagine that by this barbarous u&s;age of &s;o many, per&s;ons of rank and quality, all others would be deterred from appearing openly for their religion, laws and li|berties.</P>
<P><Q>The prerogative, (&s;ays Ludlow) was now wound up to a great height in England, and the affairs of the church tending to a conjunction with the See of Rome. But before any further progre&s;s was made, it was thought expedient, that the pul&s;e of Scotland &s;hould be felt. To this end, a form of public prayer was &s;ent them, more nearly approaching the Roman office than that u&s;ed in England. The Nobility, Clergy, and Gentry, were di&s;contented with the book it&s;elf, as well as the manner of impo&s;ing it. The Clergy of England, who had been the chief advi&s;ers and promoters of this vio|lence, prevailed on the King to cau&s;e all the Scots to be declared traitors; and they were not wanting to promoting the new levies again&s;t the Scots, contribut|ing largely thereunto: which was but rea&s;onable; it being manife&s;t to all, that the Clergy were the princi|pal authors and fomenters of tho&s;e troubles<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ludlow, vol.

<P>This war with the Scots was looked upon by the Nobi|lity, Gentry, and Commonalty of England, as the mo&s;t imprudent that could be. And indeed the King him&s;elf &s;oon found it to be &s;o the very officers and &s;oldiers of the army treating it with contempt and ridicule; in&s;o|much that he was quickly obliged to come to an agree|ment with the Scots, upon terms no way to his honour or advantage.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="012728_0020_0F94DD2FFA318988">
<Q>The mo&s;t profitable preferments in the Engli&s;h church were now given to tho&s;e of the Clergy who were mo&s;t forward to promote the new ceremonies and &s;uper&s;titi|ons.

<P>Things went on for a con&s;iderable time pretty favour|ably to the Court. By their violence and tyranny they carried all before them, and &s;eemed to bid fair to obtain a complete victory over all the laws of the kingdom, as well as over the lives and properties of the &s;ubjects. But fre&s;h troubles began now to ari&s;e. The city of London grew more and more di&s;gu&s;ted at the granting monopolies and patents; and at the unparliamentary rai&s;ing, as well as the violent methods daily practi&s;ed in collecting &s;everal illegal taxes; in&s;omuch, that a very great number of citizens, of rank and figure, at once refu&s;ed to pay &s;e|veral of the loans; at the &s;ame time declaring, they would pay no taxes at all, without the con&s;ent and autho|rity of Parliament.</P>
<P>This was a dreadful &s;hock to the Court; they gave it the name of rebellion, and determined to put an end to it at once. An order was i&s;&s;ued, to take away the &s;word from the Lord-Mayor, and mo&s;t of the chief officers of the city were in&s;tantly impri&s;oned. Hereupon the peo|ple ro&s;e, and be&s;et the hou&s;e of Laud, Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, who was &s;uppo&s;ed to put the King on tho&s;e violent cour&s;es; they demoli&s;hed his Grace's windows, but he made his e&s;cape for that time by water. Mo&s;t of the counties in England began now to &s;end up to the Privy-Council petitions and remon&s;trances, complaining of the illegal taxes, and the violent methods of collecting them<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> which gave birth to many trouble&s;ome and vexatio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> law&s;uits: And notwith&s;tanding in tho&s;e &s;uits the &s;ubject<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">

frequently got the better of the Crown, yet it many times ended in their ruin.</P>
<P>The Court now found it nece&s;&s;ary to tamper with mo&s;t of the great Lawyers. Some of the Judges and Lawyers took the bait, and for the &s;ake of &s;ome temporary pre|ferment became open and public traitors to their coun|try, by declaring in We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall, for law, <Q>that the King might impo&s;e taxes upon the people, and that he might impri&s;on and di&s;train in ca&s;e of refu&s;al.</Q></P>
<P>But to do ju&s;tice to the Lawyers, I mu&s;t acknowledge, that the far greater part of them were, in reality, friends to the con&s;titution. They di&s;covered a true Engli&s;h &s;pi|rit, and gladly embraced every opportunity to &s;upport the rights and liberties of the &s;ubjects; to the great mortification of the King and Laud.</P>
<P>This firm behaviour of the Lawyers, put the Court on making another dreadful attack on the lives and proper|ties of the &s;ubject. For finding they could not corrupt the common Courts of ju&s;tice to that degree they aimed at, they created or revived arbitrary Courts, as the Star-Chamber and High Commi&s;&s;ion Courts, wherein mon|&s;trous cruelties were daily committed, even on per&s;ons of high rank, quality, and learning.</P>
<P>The practice of tho&s;e Courts was much a-kin to that of the inqui&s;itions in Spain and Portugal at this day. Laud pre&s;ided in both of them. His power and influence were &s;o great, that every thing done there was e&s;teemed as his particular act and deed. The other members were, as Bi&s;hop Burnet ob&s;erves, <Q>little more than mere machines, to move and act as this godly Prelate directed.</Q> And truly they judged right, in putting an Eccle&s;ia&s;tic at the head of tho&s;e Courts; as nothing was intended but fines, impri&s;onments, cutting off ears, &s;litting up no&s;es, and other &s;uch bloody work: Witne&s;s the horrid barba|rity practi&s;ed on the learned William Prynne, <ABBR>E&s;q;</ABBR> Dr. Leighton, Dr. Ba&s;tick, Dr. Burton, and a multitude of others, by tho&s;e inhuman arbitrary judicatories.</P>
<P>Prynne was an eminent Lawyer of Lincoln's Inn; a Gentleman of high reputation for learning and piety; he wrote a book again&s;t the ob&s;cenity of the &s;tage, and the lewd practices of the actors, who were arrived to &s;uch

a height as to give great offence to all the &s;ober part of the nation. Laud pretended this was a reflection on the Queen, who was a mighty favourer of the women Actors, &s;he having her&s;elf al&s;o acted a pa&s;toral at Somer&s;et-hou&s;e; &s;o without any &s;hadow of law, rea&s;on, or ju&s;tice, he pro|&s;ecutes Prynne in his beloved Star-Chamber; and pro|nounces this execrable &s;entence upon him: <Q>To pay the King five thou&s;and pounds; to &s;tand twice in the pil|lory; to have both his ears cut off, one at each time; to be afterwards impri&s;oned during life without the u&s;e of pen, ink, or paper; and to be &s;tigmatized on both checks, with S. L.</Q> denoting thereby a &s;editious libeller.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time Laud pro&s;ecuted Dr. Ba&s;tick and Bur|ton; the former an eminent Phy&s;ician, the latter a Divine.</P>
<P>They were both condemned <Q>to pay five thou&s;and pounds to the King; to &s;tand in the pillory; to have both ears cut off; and to be impri&s;oned during life:</Q> All which was executed with the utmo&s;t &s;everity; and they, together with Mr. Prynne, were bani&s;hed to the re|mote I&s;lands of Scilly, Guern&s;ey, and Jer&s;ey, where they were incarcerated; neither their wives nor any of their friends being permitted to &s;ee them.</P>
<P>John Lilburn, a young Gentleman of con&s;iderable fa|mily and fortune, lived at this time with Mr. Prynne; and, having a great regard for a per&s;on of his extraordi|nary abilities and integrity, could not forbear writing &s;omething in his vindication. This &s;oon came to Laud's ears. The Prelate hereupon immediately ordered him to be brought before him in the Court of Star-Chamber, where he &s;at in triumph, and condemned this unfortu|nate youth <Q>to be whipped from the Fleet-Pri&s;on to We&s;t|min&s;ter-Hall, to receive five hundred la&s;hes, with a treble cord having knots upon it, and afterwards to &s;tand in the pillory.</Q> He was whipped &s;o bloodily, that every heart bled for him; yet he bore it with a courage, that was amazing. While he was in the pillory, in this mo&s;t deplorable condition, he expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome indignatio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> at the inju&s;tice that was done him; this was immediately carried to Laud, who &s;ent the executioner an order <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|gag him; which was in&s;tantly done. The &s;pectators were all &s;truck with horror and amazement.</P>

Three years afterwards, a Gentleman of the Hou&s;e of Commons exclaimed with great force and eloquence again&s;t the diabolical practices of this Court; and taking notice of this Mr. Lilburn's &s;ufferings, concludes with the following words: <Q>By impri&s;onment he was made a dead trunk, by whipping a rogue, by pillorying a cheat, by gaging a bea&s;t; they had better have hanged him out-right.</Q> Ru&s;hworth &s;ays, <Q>When once the Star began to &s;well big, and was delighted with blood (which was not till Laud's time, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;pring out of the ears, no&s;es, and &s;houlders of the puni&s;hed) and nothing would &s;atisfy &s;ome Clergymen, but cropt'ears, &s;lit no&s;es, whipped backs, gaged mouth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, and withal to be thrown into dungeons, and &s;ome to be bani&s;hed from their native countries to remote I&s;|lands, and by order of this Court to be &s;eparated from their wives and children; then began the Engli&s;h na|tion to lay to heart the &s;lavi&s;h condition they were like to come into, if this Court continued.</Q> The learned Lawyer Acherly &s;ays, <Q>The cruelty of tho&s;e corporal puni&s;hments, which were arbitrary, and impo&s;ed for no offence again&s;t the laws, bound down all the Gen|tlemen of England under a &s;ervile fear of the like treat|ment.</Q> The people of England had a general abhor|rence of the&s;e acts of tyranny, which one can neither write nor read of without trembling.</P>
<P>The Parliament, &s;ome years afterwards, voted the pro|&s;ecution of tho&s;e four Gentlemen to be illegal and tyran|nical, and obliged the&s;e unrighteous judges to make them reparation. After the Parliament ordered them to had he &s;et at liberty, they came to London, and were received with loud acclamations; they were met near the city by a hundred coaches filled with Gentlemen of rank and fi|gure. At the &s;ame time, one of the members of the city of London pre&s;ented to the Parliament a Petition, &s;ign|ed by more than fifteen thou&s;and hands mo&s;tly per&s;ons of note, complaining of the wicked and tyrannical Go|vernment of Laud and the other Prelates, who had treat|ed &s;ome of the be&s;t men in England, more like &s;laves at Morocco, than like Chri&s;tians, Prote&s;tants, or Engli&s;hmen.</P>

mo&s;t impious Court. The Rev. and learned Alexander Leighton, Doctor of Divinity in the two Univer&s;ities of St. Andrew's and Leyden, was arre&s;ted by two ru&s;&s;ians belonging to the Court of Star-Chamber, who dragged him with force and violence to Laud's hou&s;e, where they told him he was to be examined, Laud being then at home; but, in&s;tead of that, they carried him through a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">terraneous pa&s;&s;age to a place not opened &s;ince Queen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">y's bloody reign; from whence having fettered him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ere with heavy bolts, they hurried him to Newgate, where in the entry his wife was almo&s;t killed; he was there ca&s;t into a na&s;ty dog-hole full of rats and mice, with no light but from the uncovered roof, with no meat from Tue&s;day night 'till Thur&s;day noon. In this doleful place and plight they kept him fifteen days, &s;uffering none to come at him, not even his wife, in all that time. Four days after his commitment, Laud's officers, or ra|ther ru&s;&s;ians, came to Dr. Leighton's hou&s;e in Black Fri|ars, under a pretence of &s;earching for books. Here they laid violent hands on his poor di&s;tre&s;&s;ed wife, and u&s;ed her with &s;o much inhumanity as is a &s;hame to expre&s;s. They rifled every one in the hou&s;e, and held a cocked pi&s;tol to a boy's brea&s;t, not above five years old, threat|ning to kill him if he would not di&s;cover where the books were; at which the poor child was &s;o frightened, that he never recovered afterward. At la&s;t they carried off all the Doctor's books, hou&s;hold goods, furniture and wear|ing-apparel. During his confinement, he almo&s;t pined away, and was &s;o ill, that an Attorney and four Phy&s;ici|ans certified his ca&s;e to be de&s;perate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">All this is taken from the repre&s;entation of his ca&s;e, afterwards laid before the Parliament.</NOTE>. Yet, ab&s;ent and &s;ick, he was &s;entenced to undergo the dreadful puni&s;h|ment of which we have an account as follows in his own petition to the Parliament: <Q>This horrid &s;entence was to be inflicted with knife, fire and whip, at and upon the pillory, with ten thou&s;and pounds fine; which &s;ome of the Lords of the Court conceived could never be inflicted, only that it was impo&s;ed on a dying man, to terrify oth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rs. But Laud and his creatures cau&s;ed the &s;aid &s;entence to be executed, on the 29th of No|vember following with a witne&s;s. For the hangman

was animated with &s;trong drink all the night before, in the pri&s;on, and with threatning words, to do it cruelly. Your petitioner's hands being tied to a &s;take, be&s;ides all other torments, he received 36 &s;tripes with a treble cord; after which he &s;tood almo&s;t two hours in the pillory, in cold, fro&s;t and &s;now; and then &s;uf|fered the re&s;t, as cutting off the ear, firing the face, &s;lit|ting up the no&s;e.</Q> Here the clerk of the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, when the petition was reading, was ordered to &s;top; and when he was going on again, he was ordered to &s;top a &s;econd time, till the auditors recovered them&s;elves a little; for the Hou&s;e was melted down with tears, tender|ne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion. The petitioner proceeded: <Q>He was made a theatre of mi&s;ery to men and angels; and being &s;o broken with his &s;ufferings, that he was not able to go, the warden of the Fleet would not &s;uffer him to be carried in a coach, but hurried him away by water, to the further endangering of his life. And on that day &s;e'nnight, the &s;ores upon his back, ears, no&s;e, and face not being cured, he was again whipped at the pil|lory in Cheap&s;ide, and there had the remainder of the &s;entence executed by cutting off the other ear, &s;lit|ting up the other &s;ide of the no&s;e, and branding the other cheek.</Q> My hand trembles, my heart bleeds, I can go no farther. The Parliament, <HI>nemine contradicente,</HI> voted Dr. Leighton &s;ix thou&s;and pounds, and made him warden of that pri&s;on where he &s;o long lived in loath|&s;ome confinement.</P>
<P>This helli&s;h cruelty, which the Parliament could not bear the hearing of without being moved with tears and compa&s;&s;ion, does Bi&s;hop Laud, in his clo&s;et, write down at large in his diary with delight. Yet this is that very Bi&s;hop of whom that zealot Arch-deacon Eachard &s;ays, <Q>No man in the world was &s;o fit to make a Chancellor of the Univer&s;ity of Oxford, con&s;idering his religion and charity.</Q> When this &s;ort of men &s;peak of reli|gion and charity, the words mu&s;t be taken in a &s;en&s;e di|rectly oppo&s;ite to their meaning in the New Te&s;tament.</P>
<P>Dr. Juxon, a haughty Eccle&s;ia&s;tic, of mean abilities, had been very a&s;&s;i&s;ting to Laud in his wicked doings, who in return, got him advanced to the Bi&s;hoprick of London;
<PB N="26" REF="012728_0026_0F94DD33BA8AA220">
and &s;oon after prevailed on the weak and infatuated King, to make him Lord High-Trea&s;urer of England, which gave great di&s;gu&s;t to all the Gentry and Nobility; or, as Clarendon expre&s;&s;es it, &s;et them in a flame.</P>
<P>When any one was brought into the Star-Chamber, they had always one general charge brought again&s;t them, <HI>viz.</HI> That they were enemies to the church. Thus branded, without any regard to age, rank, or quality, they were treated with the utmo&s;t rudene&s;s. Laud would make a &s;peech of half an hour long, in favour of the divine right of Archbi&s;hops, and Bi&s;hops, Deans, Chan|cellors, Arch-deacons, mitres, copes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which he would call the true primitive con&s;titution; and would generally conclude with &s;ome &s;illy and ill-natur|ed ignorant reflections on all the foreign Prote&s;tants, particularly the churches of Am&s;terdam and Geneva. By &s;uch mi&s;-repre&s;entations he prevailed on the King to &s;hut up the Dutch and Walloon Churches in London, con|trary to the law of God, and the law of nations, and again&s;t the intere&s;t of ours in particular; great numbers of &s;ober indu&s;trious per&s;ons being thereby driven out of the kingdom.</P>
<P>Laud's &s;peeches, what influence &s;oever they had on his own tools and in&s;truments, had no other effect on his auditors in general than to expo&s;e him&s;elf; for thereby he di&s;covered his utter ignorance of all hi&s;tory, both &s;a|cred and profane.</P>
<P>Things again, for &s;ome little time, went on pretty calmly. The Court carried all before them. The cruelty of the Star-Chamber (as Acherly expre&s;&s;es it) bound down all the Gentlemen in England under a &s;lavi&s;h fear. The King openly avowed a de&s;potic ab&s;olute government, by declaring that he would be accountable for his con|duct to none but God. Nothing can be more fooli&s;h and ridiculous: Is not every Prince upon earth accountable for his actions to rea&s;on and ju&s;tice? Sure I am, a King of England is in a particular manner accountable to the laws and con&s;titutions of the realm. In one of his &s;peeches to the Parliament, he has this very remarkable expre&s;&s;i|on, <Q>As it is bla&s;phemy to di&s;pute what God may do, &s;o it is &s;edition in &s;ubjects to di&s;pute what a King
<PB N="27" REF="012728_0027_0F94DD347AAFE918">
may do.</Q> In the height of his power (Burnet &s;ays) he was &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the divine right of Kings, that he could not bear that even an elective and limited King &s;hould be called in que&s;tion by his &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>The ty<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">annical power exerci&s;ed by the Crown began now to grow daily more and more grievous; in&s;omuch, that a multitude of people began to take refuge in our foreign plantations; and numbers of families actually tran&s;ported them&s;elves, from different parts of the king|dom. The Government at length took umbrage at it, and publi&s;hed a proclamation, to re&s;train his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects from tran&s;porting them&s;elves to the plantations in Ame|rica, without a royal licence. The Court at the &s;ame time was greatly alarmed, by an information from the Cu&s;tom|hou&s;e, that eight large &s;hips were then in the river Thames, taking in pa&s;&s;engers for New-England; which immedi|ately produced the following order of council: <Q>That the Lord Trea&s;urer of England &s;hould take a &s;peedy and effectual care for the &s;topping of eight large &s;hips now in the River Thames, bound to New-England; and &s;hould likewi&s;e give orders for the putting on land all the pa&s;&s;engers and provi&s;ions intended for the voy|age.</Q></P>
<P>The providence of God appears very con&s;picuou&s;ly in this order of Council; for the famous Mr. Hampden, Sir Matthew Poynton, Sir William Con&s;table, Sir Arthur Ha&s;leridge, with many others of the &s;ame &s;tamp, and, above all, Oliver Cromwell, were actually embarked, and would have &s;ailed the next day, had they not been pre|vented by this order. When liberty is lo&s;t, let &s;laves and cowards &s;tay. True Engli&s;hmen could not bear the dole|ful &s;ight. Religion, laws and liberty were then no more!</P>
<P>The murmurings and di&s;content of the people increa&s;ed daily. The King was at la&s;t prevailed on to call a Parlia|ment; and accordingly a Parliament was &s;ummoned to meet on the 13th of April, 1640, after twelve years in|termi&s;&s;ion. The Commons pre&s;ently began to talk of re|dre&s;&s;ing grievances. Whereupon, to the &s;urprize and concern of the whole nation, the King &s;uddenly di&s;&s;olved them, after a &s;e&s;&s;ion of three weeks. And, to make the matter &s;till wor&s;e, he at the &s;ame time continued the
<PB N="28" REF="012728_0028_0F94DD353A94DF38">
convocation by a &s;pecial warrant; who, in complai&s;ance pa&s;&s;ed a canon, wherein the divine right of Kings, and unlimited obedience to them, were mo&s;t &s;trongly a&s;&s;erted.</P>
<P>By this prepo&s;terous conduct, the King &s;oon found him&s;elf reduced to greater &s;traits and difficulties than be|fore. He was obliged to &s;ummon another Parliament, to meet on the 3d of November following. In this Parlia|ment he may be truly &s;aid to have rever&s;ed his former arbitrary proceedings, (tho' without any &s;uch intention) by a more unaccountable &s;tep than any he had yet taken; and to have degraded his authority beneath every thing even his adver&s;aries could have hoped for: I mean, by his pa&s;&s;ing a bill, whereby he dive&s;ted him&s;elf of the power of di&s;&s;olving, or &s;o much as proroguing them, without their own con&s;ent. Thus he &s;ubverted the con|&s;titution of his country, to his own prejudice; as he had before violated it in numerous in&s;tances, to the detriment of his &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h con&s;titution is originally free. We do not owe our liberty to the conce&s;&s;ions of our Kings; as &s;ome eccle&s;ia&s;tical writers have laboured to prove. No, Sir. In England there has ever been a con&s;titution; that is, a &s;y|&s;tem of laws, in&s;titutions and cu&s;toms, according to which the King is obliged to govern, and the &s;ubject to obey. The King, in his coronation oath, as much &s;wears to the people, as the people &s;wear to the King. When the Prince acts in conformity to the laws, he ought not, he mu&s;t not be re&s;i&s;ted, under any pretence whatever; but if he violates the fundamental laws of the realm, and actually &s;ubverts the con&s;titution, he virtually unkings him&s;elf, and may then not only be re&s;i&s;ted, but even de|po&s;ed, by his injured people. Lineal &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and he|reditary right, have no foundation in nature; and to &s;ay they are appointed by God, is &s;o groundle&s;s and ridicu|lous a po&s;ition, as to merit no reply. There is no form of Government in the world of divine appointment: Every nation and kingdom under heaven is left to &s;ettle that form of Government which is mo&s;t agreeable to their genius, and mo&s;t conducive to the &s;ole end of all Government, the happine&s;s of the community. Even where kingly Government prevailed, hereditary fight
<PB N="29" REF="012728_0029_0F94DD35FA63EFE0">
was fir&s;t introduced by communities, to prevent &s;trife and confu&s;ion. In England this right is acknowledged and &s;tands firm, at this day; but &s;ubject to certain re|&s;trictions: that is, there have ever exi&s;ted in the com|munity certain laws founded on rea&s;on, tending to the public tranquillity and welfare: the&s;e laws are the rule of the Governor's admini&s;tration, as well as of the peo|ples' obedience; the&s;e laws are the con&s;titution of the realm; and whenever it happens that a Prince endeavours to &s;ubvert that con&s;titution, and &s;ub&s;titutes an arbitrary power in its room, then it becomes ju&s;t, rea&s;onable, and nece&s;&s;ary, not only to re&s;i&s;t, but even to depo&s;e &s;uch a Governor. And if the circum&s;tances of his de&s;cendants are &s;uch as will not comport with the intere&s;t of the nation, the lineal &s;ucce&s;&s;ion may be altered, or the Crown tran&s;|ferred from one branch of the family to another; or to a new family, when the &s;upreme law, the &s;afety of the people, calls for it. By a &s;tatute as far back as the thir|teenth year of Queen Elizabeth, it was made high trea|&s;on for any one to affirm, that the reigning Prince, with the authority of Parliament, is not able to limit and bind the Crown, and the de&s;cent and inheritance there|of. This plainly &s;hews the Legi&s;lature's opinion of he|reditary right in tho&s;e days.</P>
<P>The de&s;ign of this letter, Sir, is to convince you, and all into who&s;e hands it may fall, that King Charles was the very per&s;on who did deliberately and &s;trenuou&s;ly en|deavour to &s;ubvert and de&s;troy the con&s;titution of this kingdom, and to &s;ub&s;titute in its room a wicked, lawle&s;s and tyrannical power over the lives and properties of his &s;ubjects; and con&s;equently, that the oppo&s;ition, of his &s;ubjects, or the attempts of the people to depo&s;e him, cannot, with any colour of rea&s;on or ju&s;tice, be called <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> rebellion. No, Sir; it was a nece&s;&s;ary oppo&s;ition, found|ed on the ju&s;te&s;t principles: It was an oppo&s;ition per|fectly con&s;i&s;tent with our holy religion, with the com|mon &s;en&s;e of mankind, as well as entirely agreeable to the particular laws and con&s;titution of this realm.</P>
<P>Government, I will allow, is a &s;acred thing, as you &s;o often repeated; and to re&s;i&s;t Goverment is certainly un|lawful, and may be reckoned among the mo&s;t heinous
<PB N="30" REF="012728_0030_0F94DD36C23C3460">
crimes: But Tyranny is not Government. And as, in ca&s;e there were no civil polity, men would not, however, be de&s;titute of a natural right to defend their lives and properties, but might per&s;onally re&s;i&s;t, or, if they found it nece&s;&s;ary, de&s;troy the invaders; &s;o, as the nature of things does not allow of any e&s;tabli&s;hed umpire to deter|mine between a Prince and his people, the community has a like natural right of defending it&s;elf again&s;t an ar|bitrary or cruel admini&s;tration. Nor is the exertion of this right liable to &s;o much objection as is that of pri|vate men, for the matters in di&s;pute between tho&s;e are often of &s;uch a nature, as makes it very difficult to judge of the aggre&s;&s;or: The offence is oftentimes &s;ecret; or, immediately affect the aggrieved. Self-love may magnify it beyond its due mea&s;ure, or prompt to revenge, when prudence or good-nature may dictate otherwi&s;e in vain: Moreover, in certain ca&s;es one may &s;erve a pre&s;ent inte|re&s;t, by claiming redre&s;s where no real injury has been offered. But a con&s;titution can be no &s;ecret, nor can the violations of it be concealed. Self-love can never influ|ence the &s;ociety to re&s;i&s;t legal Government; for the &s;oci|ety can con&s;ider that as no other than its own &s;ecurity and &s;upport, and will be ever ready, for its own &s;ake, to maintain and defend it. In &s;hort, as tho&s;e in authority have greater inducements to become tyrants, than &s;ub|jects can have to re&s;i&s;t or revolt; &s;o, in fact, while it has been the almo&s;t con&s;tant aim of all governments to make them&s;elves ab&s;olute, and the generality of Princes pro|ceed by no other rule than their own caprice, with no other view but that of gratifying their lu&s;t of power, &s;ome, or plea&s;ure; no people, on the other hand, as a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ion, ever revolted, 'til their oppre&s;&s;ion became intole|rable; nor have their been many (hardly any) le&s;&s;er in|&s;urrections, or rebellions of a few, that have not been warrantable in point of equity, tho' not of prudence.</P>
<P>Again, private men in &s;ociety, however injured and abu&s;ed, mu&s;t not be their own judges; but mu&s;t &s;eek re|lief from the equitable and impartial laws of the land. But King Charles had deprived them of that re&s;ource; laws and appeals were no more; he had a hundred times broken his coronation-oath. In the very nature of Go|vernment
<PB N="31" REF="012728_0031_0F94DD3783985578">
is implied public &s;afety and protection; King Charles's Government was public de&s;truction and cala|mity. He had taken from his &s;ubjects every thing that was dear and valuable: Their peace, their rights and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; all which he had publicly &s;worn, at his co|ronation, to defend and maintain: Their properties he had unrighteou&s;ly invaded, their liberties infringed. All this he did by means the mo&s;t arbitrary and tyrannical; by repeated acts of horrid cruelty and barbarity, even on the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t of his &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>What was now left for the people to do? He was now no Prince of theirs; he had forfeited their allegiance. Liberty and laws were a je&s;t; he treated their very name with contempt. Mr. Locke &s;ays, <Q>That in a &s;tate of nature every man has a right to vindicate him&s;elf; and when &s;ociety is di&s;&s;olved, the &s;ame right returns. Men can never be deprived of public &s;afety and private defence.</Q></P>
<P>The people of England had no quarrel with King Charles, who had taken an oath to rule and govern by the laws and con&s;titution of the realm; but when this King, by a conduct of many years, had di&s;covered in &s;pite of oaths and laws, that he would rule by violence, and abide by no law, he was degenerated into a tyrant, and become a different per&s;on; then it became nece&s;&s;ary for the people to repel force by force. They &s;aw no|thing but chains and fetters on one &s;ide, and arms on the other; and they wi&s;ely flew to their arms; which is what the people of England have ever done, and ever will do, in &s;uch direful circum&s;tances. King Charles had no more right to what the law did not give him, than the Grand Turk had; and therefore they did not oppo&s;e an Engli&s;h Governor, but an invader and a tyrant: For, as Mr. Locke ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, <Q>Where&s;oever law ends, tyranny begins.</Q> Had King Charles conquered his &s;ubjects, what would he have gained, but the dete&s;table glory of a triumphant oppre&s;&s;o, and the horrid &s;atisfac|tion of &s;eeing his kingdom reduced to poverty and &s;er|vitude! Do but look into the kingdoms of France and Spain, naturally the fine&s;t in Europe, and &s;ee the migh|ty difference between their inhabitants and ours! And,
<PB N="32" REF="012728_0032_0F9BE47E10413588">
pray what makes that difference? Nothing but their &s;ub|mitting to have all their laws reduced into one &s;hort one, that of Royal will and plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Would Princes live and die in peace and &s;ecurity, let them rule by the fixed and pre&s;cribed laws of their re|&s;pective countries, and not gra&s;p at more than is given to them. If Princes will never encroach, &s;ubjects will ne|ver rebel. How much more de&s;irable, how much more &s;afe and ea&s;y is the condition of a Prince, who lives and rules by law over a free people, by their own con&s;ent? The laws are their mutual defence and guard. Sir Wil|liam Temple, in his admirable E&s;&s;ay of Government &s;ays, <Q>The &s;afety or firmne&s;s of any frame of Government de|pends on the breadth of its bottom; the broader the bottom, the le&s;s liable to be &s;haken or overthrown.</Q> The ground upon which all Government in England now does or ever will &s;tand, is the con&s;ent, the intere&s;t, and the affection of the people; therefore a monarchy, where a Prince governs by the affections, and according to the opinions of the people, makes of all others the &s;afe&s;t and firme&s;t Government. It is a poor and contemptible ambi|tion in a Prince, that of &s;welling his prerogative, and per|petually catching at advantages over his &s;ubjects; it di&s;|covers a mean &s;pirit. A Prince of a generous turn of mind will not look on his &s;ubjects as his property, and as &s;laves; but con&s;iders them under the amiable and endear|ing title of his children, and him&s;elf as their father and protector, and will ever chearfully con&s;ent they &s;hall hold their lives, liberties, and e&s;tates, by certain fixed and pre|&s;cribed laws, and not by the mere will and plea&s;ure of any &s;ingle man. The univer&s;al experience of all ages, kingdoms, and nations, directs, that no mere man ought ever to be entru&s;ted with ab&s;olute power and dominion.</P>
<P>Power of it&s;elf, without a proper check and controul, naturally makes men wanton, cruel and re&s;tle&s;s; it intoxi|cates the mind: In &s;hort, it has &s;omething in its very na|ture too great for the human &s;oul to bear; it is fit for none but God, who is infinitely wi&s;e, ju&s;t and benevolent.</P>
<P>I apprehend the facts already recited are abundantly &s;ufficient to prove that King Charles did actually &s;ubvert and de&s;troy the con&s;titution: However, to put this grand
<PB N="33" REF="012728_0033_0F9BE47EAC8C6758">
point out of a po&s;&s;ibility of being ever more di&s;puted, I will mention two or three more.</P>
<P>He publi&s;hed a book of &s;ports, requiring it to be read in all churches, thereby to promote and encourage a hor|rid profanation of the Sabbath.</P>
<P>But before I enter upon the particulars of this act, and the wicked de&s;ign of the Court by it, I would &s;ay a word or two relating to the ends of the original in&s;titution of the Sabbath; from whence it will appear to be &s;till obli|gatory upon all Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>The belief of a God is the foundation of all religion. It is nece&s;&s;ary we &s;hould know whom we are to wor&s;hip, and in what manner. It is likewi&s;e nece&s;&s;ary that &s;ome portion of time be allotted for the in&s;truction of mankind in the knowledge of their duty: Hence there is and ever will remain an eternal rea&s;on for the fourth command|ment having a place among the unalterable precepts of the moral law. Indeed, the pre&s;erving &s;erious religion would be almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible without &s;uch an in&s;titution. On the other hand, the &s;etting apart &s;ome periodical &s;ea|&s;ons for the more public and &s;olemn wor&s;hip of God, when mankind may be in&s;tructed in all tho&s;e duties that are required of them, in order to their pre&s;ent and eter|nal happine&s;s, has a tendency to exalt the &s;oul, to puri|fy the heart, to qualify us for the purpo&s;es of this life as well as of a better; in a word, to promote our temporal as well as our eternal felicity. The Sabbath was in&s;titut|ed, that men might continually commemorate the works of creation, might offer up their grateful acknowledgements to God, of all his mercies and goodne&s;s vouch&s;afed towards them, and might openly declare them&s;elves the wor&s;hippe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s of the one true God, the Author and Lord of the univer&s;e, in oppo&s;ition to the infidelity of Athei&s;ts, and the impure and ridiculous rites of idolatrous nations. The wor&s;hip paid to God in heaven is thus repre&s;ented in Scripture: The whole multitude of the heavenly ho&s;t fell down before him that &s;at on the throne, &s;aying. <HI>Worthy art thou O Lord, to receive glory and honour, and power, for thou ha&s;t created all things, and for thy plea&s;ure they are, and were created.</HI> This is the employment of &s;aints and angels in the eternal Sabbath in heaven; and the original
<PB N="34" REF="012728_0034_0F9BE47F67891030">
foundation of the in&s;titution of a Sabbath on earth was, the celebration of the prai&s;es of God. And that this &s;o|lemn and public wor&s;hip &s;hould be performed in an ac|ceptable manner, it is requi&s;ite it &s;hould be done when the mind is mo&s;t calm and &s;erene, ab&s;tracted from the noi&s;e and hurry of the bu&s;y world: Therefore it was, that when God at fir&s;t &s;anctified the &s;eventh day, or appointed it for a day of wor&s;hip, he prohibited all manner of work thereon. Gen. ii. 1, 2, 3. Exod. xx. 8, &amp;c. But the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Sabbath is not confined to public wor&s;hip alone; there are various other duties to be performed, thereon; it is then a proper time for reading the Scrip|tures, and endeavouring to under&s;tand their true meaning; for tho&s;e that are ma&s;ters of families to be a&s;&s;i&s;ting and in|&s;tructing their children and &s;ervants in the knowledge and practice of their duty: In &s;hort, 'tis to be &s;pent in what|ever tends to the honour of God, and the true intere&s;t and advancement of religion, virtue and &s;obriety in the world. Be&s;ides it ought to be con&s;idered that the circum|&s;tance of a great part of mankind, particularly tho&s;e in the lower cla&s;s of life are of &s;uch a nature, that they have no other time for improving them&s;elves in the know|ledge of God, and in the practice of true religion and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>

What will the reader now think of Archbi&s;hop Laud, of Bi&s;hop Pier&s;e, and his &s;eventy able Clergymen? I &s;hall for|bear to make any reflections of my own on &s;uch a beha|viour of men, a&s;&s;uming the &s;acred character: But give me leave to recite the plain, the hone&s;t remark of the great Mr. Locke, relating to their conduct on a like im|portant occa&s;ion: Speaking of the act of uniformity, and the wonderful compliance of the Clergy with it, he &s;ays, <Q>So great was the zeal in carrying on this Church-affair, and &s;o blind was the obedience required, that if we compute the time allotted for the Clergy to &s;ub&s;cribe the book of Common Prayer, we &s;hall plainly find it could not be printed and di&s;tributed, &s;o as one man in forty could have &s;een and read the book they did &s;o perfectly a&s;&s;ent and con&s;ent to. The Clergy readlly com|plied with it; for they are a &s;ort of men taught rather to obey than under&s;tand; and to u&s;e what learning they have to ju&s;tify and not to examine what their &s;uperi|ors command.</Q> It is reported, that the late Sir Jo&s;eph Jekyll concluded his &s;peech in favour of the mortmain act, with the following words: <Q>It hath ever been a great unhappine&s;s, that the Clergy of our e&s;tabli&s;hed church have been no better acquainted with the reli|gion, laws, government, and true hi&s;tory of their country.</Q></P>
<P>I could produce a cloud of witne&s;&s;es, to vouch in this manner, for the hone&s;ty, prudence, and piety of the Cler|gy, in pa&s;t times: Or in other words, to &s;hew, what goodly tools of lawle&s;s power they have been, and how thoroughly qualified they are for &s;uch an office. But the te&s;timonies of two &s;uch eminent per&s;ons, as the foregoing, are equivalent to tho&s;e of a multitude: Mr. Locke, mo&s;t illu&s;trious for learning and virtue; Sir Jo&s;eph, a man of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">, inflexible integrity, and impartial ju&s;tice.</P>

The&s;e in&s;ernal mon&s;ters carried their inhumanity &s;o far, as to oblige fathers and mothers to murder their own children, hu&s;bands their wives, and wives their hu&s;bands.

Pray, dear Sir, don't be angry with my military hi&s;torian. Give me leave to tell you, he was a Gentleman of quality, learning, experience, and con|duct: he commanded armies, fought battles, and go|verned the kingdom of Ireland. He was a Univer&s;ity &s;cholar, a man of &s;en&s;e, and ever e&s;teemed to have an in|flexible regard to truth and ju&s;tice. He was a man of bet|ter family and fortune than Clarendon, and was Knight of the &s;hire for the county of Wilts, when the other was only a member for Wotton Ba&s;&s;et, a &s;mall borough in the &s;ame county. Tis true, indeed, Ludlow was forced into exile, and driven as it were from place to place, to avoid a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, or falling into the hands of an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">apo|&s;tate party, while the other was advanced to office, e&s;tate, and title; but it mu&s;t be &s;aid to his real honour, that he never betrayed the con&s;titution, or de&s;erted the intere&s;t of his country.</P>
<P>The news of this dreadful ma&s;&s;acre alarmed all the people in England to a great degree; and the more &s;o, becau&s;e tho&s;e bloody Papi&s;ts confidently <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">irmed they were abetted by the King, and had a commi&s;&s;ion under the the Great Seal for what they had done. Ludlow tells us<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. I. page 19.</NOTE>. <Q>A great number of Prote&s;tants flying from the bloody hands of the Iri&s;h rebels, arrived in Eng|land, filling all places with &s;ad complaints of their cruelties to the Prote&s;tants of that kingdom; where|upon the Parliament earne&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ly pre&s;&s;ed the King to pro|claim, them rebels, by a proclamation, but could not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it till after many weeks; and then but forty of the&s;e proclamations were printed, and not above half of them publi&s;hed.</Q></P>
<P>The backwardne&s;s of the King, to declare the Iri&s;h <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> be rebels and traitors, by a proclamation under the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Seal, made a mighty noi&s;e in the Hou&s;e of
<PB N="40" REF="012728_0040_0F9BE48DAEE1EC30">
Commons; and it was there ob&s;erved by many, that tho&s;e concerned in the late tumult in Scotland, about a prayer-book, were forthwith declared rebels, in every pari&s;h church in the kingdom of England.</P>
<P>The proclamation publi&s;hed in Ireland, by Sir Phelim Oncal, at the head of tho&s;e bloody traitors, began with the following words: <Q>Be it known to all our friends and countrymen, that the King's mo&s;t excellent Ma|je&s;ty, for many great and urgent cau&s;es him thereunto moving, and repo&s;ing confidence in our fidelity, has &s;ignified to us by commi&s;&s;ion under the Great Seal of Scotland, bearing date the fir&s;t of this in&s;tant October.</Q> Then follows the Commi&s;&s;ion it&s;elf, <Q>To arre&s;t and &s;eize the goods, e&s;tates, and per&s;ons of all the Engli&s;h Prote&s;tants.</Q></P>
<P>As the rebels pretended the King's authority and com|mi&s;&s;ion, in &s;o public and open a manner, it gave great offence to the Parliament, that they were not declared rebels and traitors by proclamation. At la&s;t, to &s;atisfy them, it was promi&s;ed, that on the fir&s;t of January a proclamation &s;hould be publi&s;hed, declaring the Iri&s;h Papi&s;ts in arms to be rebels and traitors. But before this time came, Sir Edward Nicholas, one of the Secretaries of State &s;ent a &s;pecial warrant to the Printer's, directing that only forty copies &s;hould be printed, and tho&s;e not publi&s;hed till <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">is Maje&s;ty's further plea&s;ure was &s;ignified. This gave a ju&s;t foundation for all the jealou&s;ies and &s;u&s;|picions that were afterwards entertained on that affair. Dr. Calamy, in his life of Baxter, page 43. &s;ays, <Q>The Iri&s;h declared they had the King's commi&s;&s;ion for what they did; and many even at that time, weighing all circum&s;tances, believed as much; while others repre|&s;ented it as an unju&s;t and &s;candalous a&s;per&s;ion on his Maje&s;ty. But, as Providence ordered it, a certain me|morable particularity helped to &s;et this matter in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> light: The Marquis of Antrim, who was a noted man among&s;t the Iri&s;h rebels, having had his e&s;tate &s;e|qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tred, thought fit, upon the re&s;toration of King Charles the Second, to &s;ue for the re&s;titution <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it.

Hereup a King Charles wrote a letter to the Duke of Ormond, and the Council, to re&s;tore his e&s;tates; becau&s;e it appeared to tho&s;e appointed to examine it, that what he did was by his father's order and con&s;ent. The Lord Mazarine, and others in Ire|land, not fully &s;atisfied with this, thought fit &s;o far to pro&s;ecute the matter, as that the M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rquis of Antrim was forced to produce in the Hou&s;e of Commons a letter of King Charles the Fir&s;t, by which he gave him an order for the taking up arms; which being read in the Hou&s;e, produced a long &s;ilence. The whole ac|count of it, with a great many &s;urprizing particulars, was publi&s;hed in a pamphlet, entitled, <HI>Murder will out.</HI></Q> Thus far Calamy.</P>
<P>Let us now &s;ee what Bi&s;hop Burnet &s;ays of this bloody bu&s;ine&s;s, Hi&s;tory of his own Times, page 58, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> <Q>I will relate &s;ome particulars, concerning the Earl of Antrim; I had in my hands &s;everal of his letters to the King, writ in a very confident &s;tyle. Upon the Re&s;to|ration, in the year 1660, Lord Antrim was thought guilty of &s;o much blood&s;hed, that it was taken for granted, he could not be included in the act of Indem|nity, that was to pa&s;s in Ireland. Upon which he came over to London, and was lodged at Somer&s;et-Hou&s;e. He petitioned the King, to order a committee of Coun|cil, to examine the warrants he had acted by. As it &s;eemed but ju&s;t to &s;ee what he had to &s;ay for him&s;elf, &s;o a committee was nam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d, of which the Earl of Nor|thumberland was chief. He produced to them &s;ome of the King's letters, but they did not come up to a full proof. In one of them the King wrote, <HI>he had not then lei&s;ure; but referred him&s;elf to the Queen's letter,</HI> and &s;aid, <HI>That was all one as if he wrote him&s;elf.</HI> Upon this foundation, Antrim produced a &s;eries of letters, writ|ten by him&s;elf to the Queen; in which he gave her
<PB N="42" REF="012728_0042_0F9BE490B6CA1F80">
an account of every one of tho&s;e particulars that were laid to his charge, and &s;hewed the grounds he went on, and de&s;ired her directions; to every one of the&s;e he had an&s;wers, ordering him to do as he did. So a re|port was prepared, to be &s;igned by the committee, &s;et|ting forth, That he had fully ju&s;tified him&s;elf in eve|ry thing that had been objected to him, and that he ought not to be excepted out of the Indemnity. This was brought fir&s;t to the Earl of Northumberland, to be &s;igned by him; but he refu&s;ed it, and &s;aid, he was &s;orry Antrim had produced &s;uch warrants, but he did not think they could &s;erve his turn; for he did not believe any warrant from a King or Queen could ju|&s;tify &s;o much blood&s;hed, in &s;o many black in&s;tances as were laid again&s;t him. Upon his refu&s;al, the re&s;t of the Committee did not think fit to &s;ign the report; &s;o it was let fall; and the King was prevailed on to write to the Duke of Ormond, telling him, that Antrim had &s;o vindicated him&s;elf, that he mu&s;t endeavour to get him included in the indemnity: That was done, and was no &s;mall reproach to the King.</Q></P>
<P>Neither Burnet nor Calamy takes notice of the date of this famous letter of King Charles the Second, to the Duke of Ormond, but it was dated at Whitehall, the 10th of January, 1663.</P>
<P>Upon my word, Sir, this bears hard upon the memory of your holy martyr. Had I time, I could produce a variety of other in&s;tances to convince you, that you are guilty of a mo&s;t notorious mi&s;take, when you &s;o repeated|ly affirmed, he &s;uffered martyrdom for the Prote&s;tant re|ligion. I do not believe, indeed, King Charles the Fir&s;t gave the Iri&s;h Papi&s;ts a commi&s;&s;ion to cut throats, to rip up women with child in cold blood, and other &s;uch hor|rid cruelties; but from a &s;trict and impartial enquiry into the be&s;t hi&s;tories of tho&s;e days, there is really too <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> ground to believe he did countenance and give a com|mi&s;&s;ion to the Papi&s;ts to take up arms again&s;t the Prote&s;|tants; and if a horrid and bloody ma&s;&s;acre was the con|&s;equence of this commi&s;&s;ion, was not the King then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> lea&s;t a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e&s;&s;ory to it?

knows no difference between the acce&s;&s;ory and the prin|cipal, but deems them both equal in guilt and puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>During the King's &s;tay in Scotland, he endeavoured to prevail on that people to invade England, but without effect. On his return to England he was ob&s;erved to grow daily more violent and tyrannical. He countenanced a company of loo&s;e di&s;&s;olute fellows, frequenters of ale|hou&s;es, taverns and gaming hou&s;es, and kept a table for them in his own palace at Whitehall; and at the head of this rude mob, all armed, he entered the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, &s;at down in the Speaker's chair, and demanded the delivery of five of the mo&s;t eminent members, Pym, Hampden, Hollis, Stroud and Ha&s;leridge: Names that I cannot mention without a peculiar reverence; their memories will be always dear to every hone&s;t Briton, for that noble &s;tand, that brave defence they made, in favour of the religion, laws, and liberties of their country. Lud|low &s;ays, page 21. <Q>The King encouraged a great num|ber of loo&s;e and debauched fellows about the town, to repair to Whitehall, where a con&s;tant table was pro|vided for their entertainment. And again, page 24. The King went in per&s;on to the Hou&s;e of Commons, attended not only with his ordinary guards of pen&s;ion|ers but al&s;o with tho&s;e de&s;peradoes, which for &s;ome time he had entertained at Whitehall, to the number of three or four hundred, armed with partizans, &s;words&punc; and pi&s;tols. The King not finding any of the five members there, left the hou&s;e; many members cried out <HI>Privilege, Privilege,</HI> and were plea&s;ed to call it an outragious act again&s;t all the peoples' rights and pri|vileges; and, after a &s;hort debate, they unanimou&s;ly voted, <HI>That the King's entering their Hou&s;e was in a warlike manner.</HI> And therefore they, in great fear, trouble and confu&s;ion, adjourned to the Guildhall, in the city, for their better &s;ecurity. The &s;ame evening the King went into the city; but his coach was at|tended by multitudes, crying out, <HI>Privilege of Parlia|ment.</HI> This happened on the 4th of January, 1641&punc; and from this day we mu&s;t date the beginning of the civil war. The King doubled his guards at White|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">, collected a great quantity of fire-arms, and gun|powder,
<PB N="44" REF="012728_0044_0F9BE4922725E190">
&s;ent &s;everal per&s;ons into the country, to rai&s;e officers, and &s;oldiers, and di&s;patched his Papi&s;t Queen to Holland, who carried with her privately the Crown jewels of England, which &s;he pawn'd to Mr. Web&s;ter, a noted Banker of Am&s;terdam, for a great &s;um, and laid it out in arms, to enable his Maje&s;ty to make war again&s;t his own &s;ubjects.</Q></P>
<P>By all accounts, and in all &s;hapes, the King him&s;elf was the beginner of this dreadful civil war.</P>
<P>The preten&s;ion of both parties being &s;ubmitted to the deci&s;ion of the &s;word, the only di&s;pute now was, Whe|ther the people of England &s;hould again recover their laws and liberties, or be governed by the ab&s;olute will and caprice of a &s;ingle per&s;on? Whitlock, &s;peaking of the Par|liament forces, &s;ays: <Q>Mo&s;t of them were freeholders, and freeholders &s;ons, who upon matter of con&s;cience engaged in the quarrel; and then being armed within by the &s;atisfaction of their own con&s;cience, and without with good iron arms, they would as one man &s;tand firmly, and charge de&s;perately.</Q> Ludlow &s;ays<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. I. page 41, 42.</NOTE>, <Q>Things be|ing brought to this extremity, the nation was driven to a nece&s;&s;ity of arming, in defence of the laws, openly and frequently violated by the King, who now re&s;olved to do that by force of arms, which he could not do by the &s;trength of argument. I thought it my duty, as an Engli&s;hman, to enter into the &s;ervice of my country, in the army commanded by the Earl of E&s;&s;ex, under the authority of the Parliament.</Q> A true Engli&s;h &s;pi|rit! O how far different this from Clarendon and Eachard!</P>
<P>At la&s;t, after a dreadful civil war of many years, re|ligion, laws and liberty prevailed, as they ever will do in England, &s;ooner or later. The King, by the fate of war, was taken, and afterwards made a pri&s;oner at New|Port, in the i&s;le of Wight. Here he entered into a treaty with the Parliament, commi&s;&s;ioners being appoint|ed for that purpo&s;e by both parties. The King entirely de&s;pairing doing any thing more by force, made a great many conce&s;&s;ions, viz.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) To indemnify the Parliament for all that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="45" REF="012728_0045_0F9BE492E5114200">
been done by them during the late war, which the King acknowledged they were nece&s;&s;itated to do in their ju&s;t and lawful defence.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) He agreed, that Archbi&s;hops &s;hould be aboli&s;hed, and that the Bi&s;hops who remained, provi&s;ionally, &s;hould not exerci&s;e authority, juri&s;diction, or ordination, but with the advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of their Pre&s;byters, that the Pre&s;byterian Government &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed for three years, at the end of which the A&s;&s;embly of Divines, his Maje&s;ty naming but twenty more, &s;hould determine the form of Church Government for the future; and that the Common Prayer &s;hould be taken away out of all churches and chapels.</P>
<P>I mention the&s;e particulars to &s;hew the ignorance and pre&s;umption of tho&s;e who annually affirm, the King was a Martyr for the church.</P>
<P>During this treaty the Parliament received letters from Colonel Jones in Ireland, giving an account of the arri|val of the Marquis of Ormond in that kingdom, with a commi&s;&s;ion to conclude a peace with the rebels, at the very time when the King was treating with the Parlia|ment to carry on the war again&s;t them. Jones al&s;o in|tercepted a letter of Ormond's to the chief of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Ma&s;&s;acrers; it was &s;igned Ormond, and directed <Q>To our loving friend Sir Richard Black, Chairman of the A&s;&s;embly of the confederate Catholics at Kilkenny.</Q> Lilly &s;peaking of the veracity of King Charles I. &s;ays of him: He had &s;o much of &s;elf-end in all he did, it was a mo&s;t difficult thing to hold him clo&s;e to his word or pro|mi&s;e; &s;o that &s;ome foreign Princes be&s;towed on him the character of a mo&s;t fal&s;e Prince, and one that never kept his word except for his own advantage. Again, though in time of Parliament he often promi&s;ed to redre&s;s grie|vances; yet the be&s;t friend he hath cannot produce one act of good he ever did his &s;ubjects in the vacancy of Par|liament. Does this agree with the King's &s;trict ju&s;tice, piety, and devotion, that Clarandon &s;peaks of? This di&s;covery put an end to the treaty at once.</P>
<P>The King's death was a thing now re&s;olved on, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in the army who had power to put it in execution. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ey obliged the Commons to concur in the de&s;ign,

The number of the exclud|ed was about one hundred and forty: Only &s;ome of the&s;e were voluntarily Seceders, in di&s;gu&s;t for the force put upon their brethren. The &s;ecluded members imme|diately publi&s;hed a &s;olemn declaration, &s;ignifying, that all the votes and ordinances of Parliament &s;ince their exclu|&s;ion, and during the continuance of the army's influence upon the Hou&s;e, were null and void, and no ways obli|gatory. The &s;itting members, on the other hand, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> this declaration to be &s;candalous and &s;editious.</P>
<P>Cromwell and a few more of the army had now the majority in Parliament, and court was made to them ac|cordingly. They abu&s;ed that power they found they had, both in the army and the Hou&s;e of Commons, to execute the ba&s;e de&s;ign they had formed again&s;t the King's life. I have no re&s;erves; I love a fair and open repre&s;en|tation of things. I can &s;ee wickedne&s;s, tyranny, and a flagrant breach of tru&s;t on both &s;ides. I will readily grant that the King had hard and cruel u&s;age; that he was murdered; that he was de&s;troyed by a faction! The con&s;titution was now again trampled upon, the laws were violated; tyranny and a wicked military force u&s;urped their room! But &s;till let us trace this lamentable &s;tate of things to its fir&s;t cau&s;e. It began from the Court and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. It was the Monarch who created a di&s;gu&s;t to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. It was the in&s;olence of churchmen that made the church odious. You dete&s;t the murder of the King; &s;o do I altogether as much. But I likewi&s;e dete&s;t the murder of the con&s;titution, in which he and his wicked C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;ellors were principals, and which for many years <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> been effecting. You mentioned the murder of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and the abolition of the Monarchy as the mo&s;t wonderful events that ever the world produced. But, Sir, give me leave to tell you, that there was nothing wonder|ful or &s;urpri&s;ing therein. Any one that had been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> all acquainted with the Hi&s;tory of kingdoms or &s;tates <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> ea&s;ily have fore&s;een them.

by troops not only hardy and brave, but the mo&s;t &s;ober al&s;o, and be&s;t di&s;ciplined, that this or any other na|tion had ever &s;een. What wonder is it, if the leaders of &s;uch as the&s;e, if they had an inclination to &s;ubvert the laws of their count<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y, to &s;et up for them&s;elves, and erect a new tyranny in their own per&s;ons, in the place of that from which they had ju&s;t delivered her; I &s;ay, what won|der is it, if a &s;et of men thus qualified accompli&s;h their purpo&s;es. It was the be&s;t of the Roman troops that were the in&s;truments of Cae&s;ar's u&s;urpation. Soldiers are inured to implicit obedience. Whatever their officers com|mand they &s;eldom &s;cruple. It is their profe&s;&s;ion to di&s;|pute by force, and the &s;word. Cromwell, Ireton, and a few more of the army, having &s;ucceeded in that bold and impious attempt, of &s;ecluding by force one hundred and forty members, or purging the hou&s;e, as it was termed, found them&s;elves, by accur&s;ed experience, able to over|balance and controul the civil authority. They lo&s;t no time, they exerted their &s;trength, de&s;troyed the King, and &s;eized the &s;overeign power at once. Men naturally de&s;ire dominion, and riches; and it is ridiculous to pre|&s;ume they will not endeavour to attain them, when they have opportunity and power. I could mention many parts of Europe, that have been en&s;laved by their own troops. This has been and ever will be the ca&s;e of all countries, that &s;ub&s;i&s;t by &s;tanding armies. When tho&s;e have conquered the enemies of their country, they will &s;ubdue their country for them&s;elves. In&s;tances of this are too numerous, to allow ours to be wondred at.</P>
<P>You was all along gro&s;sly mi&s;taken, in pre&s;uming the death of the King to be a national act. It was merely the act of the army. Ireton was the per&s;on who drove on the King's trial and death. Cromwell was a long time in &s;u&s;pence about it. <Q>Ireton (&s;ays Burnet) had the principles and temper of a Ca&s;&s;ius in him, he &s;tuck at nothing that could have turned England to a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and he found out Cook, and Brad&s;law, two bold <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, as proper in&s;truments for managing it.</Q></P>

I could &s;ay a good deal in vindication of the Long Par|liament, from the fir&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion to the la&s;t moment of their exi&s;tence; which was when the army by force &s;ecluded above one hundred and forty members, as afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>They were after that no Parliament; nor could they in any &s;hape be deemed the repre&s;entative body of the na|tion. No, certainly. They were then under the terror, awe, and influence of a wicked military power, which would admit of no check or controul. I chu&s;e here to make u&s;e of the words of others. Wellwood, in his Memoirs &s;ays, <Q>No age ever produced greater men than tho&s;e who &s;at in that Parliament. They had &s;uffi|cient abilities and inclinations, to render the King and their country happy. They &s;et down a &s;cene of grie|vances under which the nation had long groaned; the many cruelties and illegal practices of the Star-cham|ber and High Commi&s;&s;ion Courts were now laid open; and it was in&s;i&s;ted on, that tho&s;e two arbitrary tribunals &s;hould be thrown down.</Q></P>
<P>The intentions of this Parliament were certainly ju&s;t and noble, and tended to the equal advantage of King and people. But the King urged on his own ruin, &s;tep by &s;tep, and at la&s;t came to an open rupture with the Parlia|ment, which made the gap too wide to be again clo&s;ed. I am &s;en&s;ible, Clarendon and Eachard every where treat this Parliament as a parcel of rebels and &s;coundrels, and repre&s;ent their proceedings in a ba&s;e and injurious man|ner. But I have a greater authority than that of any pri|vate man, to &s;upport and vindicate their proceedings: That very convention that brought in King Charles II. though ready to run mad with loyalty, would not &s;uffer any reflection on the conduct of tho&s;e illu&s;trious patriots, except only in the article of beheading the King. Mr. William Lenthal, who had been Speaker of the Long Par|liament, and was a member of the re&s;toring one, hap|pened to drop this expre&s;&s;ion in the debate about the general pardon, <Q>He who fir&s;t drew his &s;word <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the late King, committed as great an offence as he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> cut off his head.</Q> For which expre&s;&s;ion the Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Commons ordered him to be &s;eized in&s;tantly by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Serjeant, and directed Sir Harbottle Grim&s;tone, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

They apprehend there is much poi&s;on in the &s;aid words, and that they were &s;poken out of a de&s;ign to inflame, and to render tho&s;e who drew the &s;word to bring delinquents to puni&s;he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t, and to a&s;&s;ert their ju&s;t liber|ties, equally culpable with tho&s;e who cut off the King's head.</Q></P>
<P>Do not Clarendon and Eachard &s;tand unan&s;werably condemned in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner by this declara|tion of the Hou&s;e of Commons, pronounced by their Speaker? after which all future Critics on them would be &s;uperfluous.</P>
<P>I now come to that part of your &s;ermon, wherein, ac|cording to the u&s;ual cu&s;tom, you laid the trial and death of the King at the door of the Pre&s;byterians. Mo&s;t true it is, on the contrary, that of all our different parties, none had the hone&s;ty and courage to appear openly for the King but the Pre&s;byterians. They exerted them&s;elves in public and private, and omitted no one thing that was po&s;&s;ible to be done, to prevent the execrable fact of put|ting his Maje&s;ty to death. No &s;ooner was he taken and confined as a pri&s;oner, but Mr. Calamy, Mr. Mari&s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">&punc; Mr. A&s;h, Mr. Whiteaker, Mr. Sedwick, and many other Pre&s;byterian Mini&s;ters waited on the Lord General Fair|fax, te&s;tifying their di&s;like of making the King a pri&s;oner. A few days after, above forty of the Pre&s;byterian Mini|&s;ters joined in a letter to the General, and officers in the army, freely declaring again&s;t their &s;eizing and impri&s;on|ing the per&s;on of the King. This was about the latter end of December, 1648. About the middle of January it began to appear, that the death of the King was a matter fixed and determined by the army. On the 18th of January there was another meeting, of more than &s;ixty of the principal Pre&s;byterian Mini&s;ters in and about London, wherein it was in&s;tantly agreed, that, in behalf of them&s;elves and their re&s;pective congregations, they

&s;hould by &s;ome public act declare, before God, angels, and men, their abhorrence of the &s;eizing and impri&s;on|ing the per&s;on of the King, and their dete&s;tation of put|ting him to death; which they apprehended would be the i&s;&s;ue of the trial then depending. In con&s;equence of this re&s;olution, the following repre&s;entation was immedi|ately printed and publi&s;hed, in the form of a letter, di|rected to the General and Council of war:</P>
<P>"That they appeared at fir&s;t for the Parliament, on the propo&s;itions and orders of the Lords and Commons, June 10th, 1642, for bringing in of money and plate, wherein they were a&s;&s;ured it &s;hould be no otherwi&s;e em|ployed, than to maintain the Prote&s;tant religion, the King's authority, his per&s;on in his Royal dignity, the free cour&s;e of ju&s;tice, the laws of the land, the peace of the kingdom, and the privilege of Parliament, again&s;t any force that &s;hould oppo&s;e them.

They warned and exhorted in the name of the great God, all that belong to their charge and mini&s;try, to keep clo&s;e to the ways of God, the rules of religion, the fundamental con&s;titution and government of the kingdom; not &s;uffering them&s;elves to be &s;educed from it, by being drawn to &s;ub&s;cribe the late models or agreement of the people, which directly tended to &s;ubvert the fundamental government; and to mourn bitterly for the &s;ins of all degrees of men, and beg of God that he would re&s;train the violence of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

Some of the &s;ub&s;cribers delivered it to the General, and Council of war; which, as Calamy ob&s;erves, was running a great hazard, as things then &s;tood; and may be ju&s;tly reckoned as an evidence of the great integrity and hone&s;|ty of the per&s;ons who &s;ub&s;cribed it.

King; but he was full of regret and unea&s;ine&s;s, and &s;aw that he had been trick'd and overpowered by his under officers, &s;o that &s;oon after he laid down his commi&s;&s;ion, and never had to do with the army more, whereby Cromwell became head of all.</P>
<P>What &s;ort of mortals mu&s;t tho&s;e vicars, curates, doc|tors and dignitaries be, that pa&s;s &s;entence of damnation, every 30th of January, on tho&s;e Mini&s;ters and their bre|thren, for killing this very King, whom, with &s;o much boldne&s;s, truth and courage, they laboured to &s;ave? Strange and &s;urprizing infatuation, egregious ignorance and ba&s;ene&s;s, which no age or hi&s;tory can parallel!</P>
<P>And here, Sir, you did not only &s;eem to expatiate on the faults of the dead, with a bitter and malicious plea|&s;ure; but was plea&s;ed to ca&s;t many &s;evere and indecent reflections on the pre&s;ent generation of Pre&s;byterians; <Q>and did call on them aloud, to repent and mourn, in &s;ackcloth and a&s;hes; to weep and fa&s;t, with the utmo&s;t contrition and &s;elf-aba&s;ement; that &s;o they might not bear the abominable iniquities of their forefathers; but by their extraordinary humiliation and &s;orrow might avert the ju&s;t indignation and wrath of Almighty God.</Q></P>
<P>Con&s;idering all this, I was quite a&s;toni&s;hed at what you advanced on this head In truth, it was not only con|trary to rea&s;on and ju&s;tice; but directly oppo&s;ite to all divine revelation. It is from thence inconte&s;tably plain, that every man &s;hall &s;tand upon his own bottom, &s;hall be condemned or acquitted hereafter, agreeable to his own conduct and behaviour; or as the New Te&s;tament ex|pre&s;&s;es it, &s;hall be judged according to the actions done in the body, whether they be good or evil. It is no where &s;aid, that any &s;hall be judged according to the actions done or performed by their great-grandfathers, &s;ixty or &s;eventy years before they were born. No, the very &s;u&s;|picion of it carries an injurious reflection on the ju&s;tice and goodne&s;s of the Deity. And it can never enter into my held to conceive, that I can be properly puni&s;hable for the &s;ins of my parents. Of my own &s;ins I ought to repent, and to be filled with &s;hame and indignation at the remembrance of them; and I am certainly liable to pu|ni&s;hment in proportion to the degree of my guilt; But of
<PB N="53" REF="012728_0053_0F94DD443A17D380">
my grandfather's or great-grandfather's &s;ins I can no more repent, than I can of the &s;ins of my grandchildren yet unborn. It is impo&s;&s;ible for me to prevent what &s;hall be done after I am dead, &s;o it was equally impo&s;&s;ible for me to help what was acted before I was born.</P>
<P>You al&s;o hinted at the political principles of the pre|&s;ent di&s;&s;enters. I take the liberty to &s;ay, they are not a&s;hamed of them. They are the &s;ame now as in the days of their forefathers. Upon their principles the late glo|rious revolution was founded. Their principles have been confirmed by many and repeated Acts of Parlia|ment, and have often had the &s;uffrage and &s;anction of the mo&s;t augu&s;t a&s;&s;emblies upon earth. Upon the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">r principles Sir, &s;tands the parliamentary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the Crown of the&s;e realms, in the pre&s;ent reigning family; and God Almighty grant it may there ever &s;tand. Yea, I could tell you a time when the clergy them&s;elves were glad to borrow their principles.</P>
<P>I cannot fini&s;h my remarks on your &s;ermon, without taking notice of what you was plea&s;ed to advance in the clo&s;e of it, relating to the title King Charles had to the Crown of England, which you called an ab&s;olute, inde|&s;ea&s;ible, hereditary right, and con&s;equently not liable to cavil or di&s;pute, by party or faction. This is what I think &s;hould never he &s;aid in pulpits, as it &s;eems to imply a di&s;|tru&s;t of the validity of the parliamentary e&s;tabli&s;hment.</P>
<P>I told you in the beginning of my remarks, that as far back as the thirteenth year of Queen Elizabeth, it was made high-trea&s;on, for any one to affi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">m, that the reign|ing Prince, with the authority of Parliament, is not able to limit or bind the Crown. I doubt not but you imbibed this principle of hereditary right at Oxford, forty years ago; and having never &s;uffered your&s;elf impartially to examine its foundation, it is become to you as a demon|&s;trated truth. But the pre&s;ent age is given to rea&s;oning; they do not &s;o implicitly &s;ubmit to ab&s;urdities, though they have the &s;anction of a convocational decree.</P>
<P>You was plea&s;ed to dre&s;s up the principles of the pre&s;|byterians in a frightful &s;hape; but let me tell you, Sir, in my turn, that the principles of your party have been burnt, not by a rude and lawle&s;s, rabble, but by the com|mon h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ngman, in broad day-light, before the Royal Ex|change
<PB N="54" REF="012728_0054_0F94DD44F9F82238">
in London, and by authority of Parliament. Per|haps you never have heard of this contemptuous treat|ment of the Oxford principles, and therefore I will give it you from the Parliamentary records. <Q><HI>Anno Domini</HI> 1710. The Hou&s;e of Lords taking into con&s;ideration the judgment and decree of the Univer&s;ity of Oxford, pa&s;&s;ed in their convocation, 21&s;t July, 1683. It was re&s;olved by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in Par|liament a&s;&s;embled, that the &s;aid judgment and decree &s;hall be burnt by the hands of the common hangman, before the Royal Exchange in London, between the hours of twelve and one, on Monday the 17th in&s;tant of March, in the pre&s;ence of the Lord Mayor of the city of London, and the two Sheriffs of London and Middle&s;ex.</Q></P>
<P>In this decree were &s;trongly a&s;&s;erted the doctrine of pa&s;&s;ive obedience, the ab&s;olute, indefea&s;ible, and heredi|tary right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the Crown; and Revolution principles were called damnable. Bi&s;hop Burnet, &s;peak|ing of this dete&s;table decree, &s;ays, <Q>The Univer&s;ity of Oxford a&s;&s;erted the King's prerogative in the highe&s;t &s;train of the mo&s;t abject flattery po&s;&s;ible, both in their addre&s;&s;es, and in their wild decree; in which they laid together a &s;et of &s;uch highflown maxims, as mu&s;t e&s;ta|bli&s;h an unaccountable tyranny.</Q>.</P>
<P>I will readily grant, it is an action worthy a Mini&s;ter of the Church of England, to di&s;cover a proper zeal for the &s;upremacy and prerogative of his Prince; but then, Sir, it &s;hould be with &s;uch limitations, and re&s;trictions, as are con&s;i&s;tent with our known and e&s;tabli&s;hed laws, and agreeable to the &s;ettlement of the Imperial Crown of the&s;e realms. Under this head you might have te&s;tified &s;ome love to your country, &s;ome little attachment to the liberties of your fellow-&s;ubjects. But the advancing or the bare hinting that impious doctrine, of an ab&s;olute, indefea&s;ible, hereditary right, is not only weak and fool|i&s;h, but may be attended with dangerous con&s;equences; as it may &s;o un&s;ettle the minds of &s;ome of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects, as to make them &s;u&s;pect the validity of his Par|liamentary title: A title by far the be&s;t and mo&s;t glori|ous, and will be found by experience to be the mo&s;t durable. An ab&s;olute Prince is of all others the mo&s;t in|&s;ecure;
<PB N="55" REF="012728_0055_0F94DD45BA4E3178">
as he proceeds by no rule of law, he can have no rule of &s;afety. He acts by violence; and violence is the only &s;afe-guard again&s;t him. It was the advancing this &s;lavi&s;h doctrine from the pulpit, in the latter part of Queen Anne's reign, that greatly contributed to the re|bellion which broke out on the acce&s;&s;ion of the late King, to the throne of this kingdom. This, with great propri|ety might be called the Grand Rebellion. It was a re|bellion, the mo&s;t wicked and diabolical, that ever the world produced; a rebellion again&s;t King, Lords and Commons; again&s;t religion, laws, and liberty; in favour of chains, fetters, &s;lavery, blackne&s;s and darkne&s;s both of body and mind. An event that will leave an eternal mark of infamy and di&s;grace on the Briti&s;h nation, as many of the nobility, gentry, and commonalty, were ei|ther openly engaged therein, or &s;ecretly favoured it. I have often wi&s;hed, for the honour of the nation, that an hundred of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of the rebels had been confined in Bedlam, during their re&s;pective lives, that after-ages might have concluded, none but fools and madmen were engaged in that mo&s;t wicked and impious attempt.</P>
<P>And here I cannot omit taking notice, not only to the everla&s;ting honour of the Pre&s;byterians, but of all the different denominations of Di&s;&s;enters, that there was &s;carce a &s;ingle man of them to be found, at that critical period, but what openly declared for the Parliamentary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the Crown in the Hou&s;e of Hanover; and were preparing to venture their lives and fortunes in its de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ence.</P>
<P>The invader, you know, Sir, claimed under the notion of an ab&s;olute, indefea&s;ible, hereditary right. Whether he was, or was not, the &s;on of King James, is quite out of the que&s;tion; it is of no con&s;equence at all to any one man in England, Scotland or Ireland, who was his fa|ther, or who was his mother; he is a per&s;on attainted by law, and therefore cannot reign; and all his aiders, and abbettors, or whoever holds any corre&s;pondence or intel|ligence with him, are deemed and judged guilty of high trea&s;on<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See the Act of the 14th of King William, entitled,</HI> An Act of attainder of the pretended Prince of Wales of High-trea&s;on.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="012728_0056_0F94DD467A4ACA60">
I a&s;&s;ure you, Sir, was I in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mines of Mexico and Peru, together with all the other riches of tho&s;e va&s;t and mighty empires, I would mo&s;t chearfully &s;a|crifice all, to the very la&s;t &s;hilling, to pre&s;erve and tran&s;mit to po&s;terity, the pre&s;ent Parliamentary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the Crown, with which are connected religion, laws, liberty, and independency; and &s;hould, in my mo&s;t calm and &s;erious moments, e&s;teem my conduct to be ju&s;t and pru|dent. And I per&s;uade my&s;elf, I here &s;peak the lan|guage of every true Briton. Mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing then it is that any one who has bound him&s;elf by the &s;tronge&s;t en|gagements religion can lay men under, and has tied down his &s;oul by an oath, to defend and maintain the pre&s;ent &s;ettlement of the Crown in the illu&s;trious Hou&s;e of Ha|nover, &s;hould be &s;o wicked and profane, as to hint any thing in favour of an ab&s;olute hereditary right.</P>
<P>Thanks be to Heaven for this <HI>Parliamentary &s;ettlement of the imperial Crown of Great Britain:</HI> A &s;ettlement, which our religion, our country, our liberty, and our pro|perty, oblige us to maintain: Yea, without the &s;olemni|ty of an oath, we are bound to defend this e&s;tabli&s;hment, by every motive that can influence the mind of men; honour, con&s;cience, and the love of our country, con|&s;trains us to it.</P>
<P>We &s;hould certainly have been chained down, in the mo&s;t abject condition of &s;ervitude, in the reign of the late King James, had not the Almighty, in mercy, given us that glorious in&s;trument of his Providence, the late and memorable King William; by who&s;e &s;ea&s;onable in|terpo&s;ition we are now in a condition of enjoying life, liberty, religion and property.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not content my&s;elf with remarks only from the different hi&s;torians of tho&s;e days; but let us &s;ee the calm and deliberate re&s;olutions of the Lords and Commons, the repre&s;entative body of the whole nation: In the fir&s;t year of King William and Queen Mary, an Act of Par|liament was made, entitled, An ACT <HI>declaring the rights and liberties of the &s;ubject, and &s;ettling the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the Crown:</HI> It begins thus, 'Whereas the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons in Parliament a&s;&s;embled at We&s;tmin&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">r, lawfully, fully and freely repre&s;enting all

the e&s;tates of the people of this realm, did upon the thir|teenth of February, in the year of our Lord 1688, pre|&s;ent unto their Maje&s;ties, then called and known by the names and &s;tile of William and Mary, Prince and Prin|ce&s;s of Orange, being pre&s;ent in their proper per&s;ons, a certain declaration in writing, made by the &s;aid Lords and Commons in the following words, "Whereas the late King James II. by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of divers evil Coun&s;ellors, Judges and Mini&s;ters employed by him, did endeavour to &s;ubvert and extirpate the Prote&s;tant religion, and the laws and liberties of this kingdom, by a&s;&s;uming and exerci&s;ing a power of di&s;pen&s;ing with, and &s;u&s;pending of laws, and the execution of laws, without the con&s;ent of Parliament, &amp;c. All which are utterly and directly con|trary to the known laws, &s;tatutes, and freedom of this realm: And the &s;aid late King, having abdicated the Government, and the Throne thereby being vacant, they the &s;aid Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Com|mons, a&s;&s;embled at We&s;tmin&s;ter, do re&s;olve, That Willi|am and Mary, Prince and Prince&s;s of Orange, be, and be declared King and Queen of England, France and Ireland, and all the dominions thereunto belonging, &amp;c. &amp;c." Then they enjoin the following oath to be taken, "I A. B. do &s;incerely promi&s;e and &s;wear, that I will be faithful, and bear true allegiance to Their Maje&s;ties King William and Queen Mary: So help me God."</P>
<P>In the declaration pre&s;ented by the Lords and Com|mons to King William and Queen Mary, on their ac|ceptance of the Crown, after having a&s;certained the rights and liberties of the people in the &s;tronge&s;t terms, we have the following words: "And it is hereby-de|clared and enacted, that all and &s;ingular the rights and liberties, a&s;&s;erted and claimed in the &s;aid declaration, are the true, ancient, and indubit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ble rights and liberties of the people of this kingdom; and &s;o &s;hall be e&s;teemed, al|lowed, and adjudged, deemed, and taken to be, and that all and every the particulars afore&s;aid &s;hall be firmly and &s;trictly holden and ob&s;erved, as they are expre&s;&s;ed in the &s;aid declaration."</P>

convention of their Lords and Commons, they de|clare, "That whereas King James VII. by the advice of wicked Coun&s;ellors, did invade the fundamental con&s;ti|tutions of Scotland, and altered it from a legal, limited monarchy, to an arbitrary and de&s;potic power, and exert|ed that power to the &s;ubver&s;ion of the Prote&s;tant religion, and to the violation of the laws and liberties of the king|dom, &amp;c. &amp;c.

<P>In the&s;e Acts of Parliament the cau&s;es and rea&s;ons of the late revolution are fully &s;et forth.</P>
<P>The people of England and Scotland, when they had gone &s;o far, plainly &s;aw the work was but half done.

This con|&s;ideration gave birth to another <HI>Act of Parliament,</HI> made in the thirteenth year of King William, entitled, "An Act for the further limitation of the Crown, and for the better &s;ecuring the rights and liberties of the &s;ub|ject." By this act "the mo&s;t illu&s;trious Prince&s;s Sophia, Electre&s;s and Dutche&s;s Dowager of Hanover, and the heirs of her body being Prote&s;tants, were declared the next in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the Prote&s;tant line, to the Crown of England, &amp;c. &amp;c. after the late King William and the Prince&s;s Anne of Denmark, and their re&s;pective i&s;&s;ue; and it is enacted, that the Crown &s;hould be, remain, and continue to the &s;aid Prince&s;s Sophia, and the heirs of her body being Prote&s;tants; and there unto the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in the name of all the people of this realm, did mo&s;t humbly and faith|fully &s;ubmit them&s;elves, their heirs, and po&s;terities, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="012728_0059_0F94DD1BC782AF08">
About this time a little Popi&s;h Jacobite party began to peep up; upon which another <HI>Act of Parliament</HI> was framed, entitled, "An Act of attainder of the pre&s;ent pretended Prince of Wales of high trea&s;on." This Jaco|bite faction &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, our Great Deliverer, and his glorious Parliament, having a dread upon their minds, of that Popery, Slavery, and Arbitrary Power, from which they had been &s;o lately delivered, were now re&s;olv|ed to do the work effectually; and for that purpo&s;e they pa&s;&s;ed another Act for extingui&s;hing the hopes of the pre&s;ent pretended Prince of Wales, and all other preten|ders what&s;oever, and their open and &s;ecret abettors. And, to clinch the nail and make thorough work of it, they framed the Adjuration Oath, and thereby tied down the people, body, &s;oul, and e&s;tates, to maintain and defend the &s;ettlement of the Crown in the Hou&s;e of Hanover.</P>
<P>By the&s;e means our glorious Deliverer compleated his work, and handed down to us the mo&s;t pure religion and the be&s;t con&s;titution in the univer&s;e; guarded, and fen|ced about by oaths, and laws, as unalterable as human affairs can be.</P>

<P>I have often wi&s;hed that the &s;undry Acts of Parlia|ment, for limiting and &s;etting the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the Crown, were more univer&s;ally known and under&s;tood; and that the mo&s;t &s;ignificant clau&s;es of them were engraved on monuments of bra&s;s or marble, erected for that purpo&s;e in every pari&s;h church in England; that &s;o the mo&s;t wicked and impious of all doctrines, that of an ab&s;olute, indefea&s;ible, hereditary right, might &s;tand publicly and perpetually condemned.</P>
<P>I have only one remark more, and then &s;hall have done with your famous &s;ermon. You was plea&s;ed largely to in&s;i&s;t on the obligation all men are under, to pay a due and proper regard to the national religion, and national faith; and endeavoured to prove, that the legi&s;lature is at all times truly and properly inve&s;ted with a power, not only to &s;upport the national faith and religion, but to enforce it, and even its different modes and ceremonies, by civil penalties.</P>
<P>I would not be under&s;tood here, to be running down all e&s;tabli&s;hments, and particularly that of the Church of England; but the e&s;tabli&s;hing a national faith and reli|gion, and enforcing the &s;ame by civil penalties, does not appear to be rea&s;onable and ju&s;t, or quite con&s;i&s;tent with the nature and end of civil &s;ociety. Religion, I mean true and real religion, in its own nature is incapable of being e&s;tabli&s;hed by any law. It is not &s;ubject to hu|man in&s;pection, nor can it be controuled by any human authority. It con&s;i&s;ts in the reverence and love of God, in con&s;tant &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his divine will, and in a regu|lar and devout obedience to his Laws. This is truly re|ligion; but it cannot be infu&s;ed into the mind by any other means than by argument and per&s;ua&s;ion. There|fore I &s;ubmit it to the con&s;ideration of the public, if it be ju&s;t or rea&s;onable for the Magi&s;trate to enforce the nati|onal religion and faith by civil penalties. The different
<PB N="61" REF="012728_0061_0F94DD48B9E0DD30">
modes and ceremonies of wor&s;hip indeed may be e&s;tabli&s;h|ed by the magi&s;trate, but this is not the e&s;tabli&s;hment of religion; the&s;e modes and ceremonies are, at be&s;t, only forms of godline&s;s, and are often de&s;titute of real devo|tion, reverence and love of God. Mahometani&s;m is certainly an impo&s;ture, and its di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">erent modes and cere|monies of wor&s;hip are fooli&s;h and ridiculous; the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of them does not alter their nature, or make them a jot more rea&s;onable and ju&s;t. Upon the whole, there is &s;omething in the nature of true and real religion incon&s;i&s;tent with any civil e&s;tabli&s;hment what&s;oever. But the contending for, and e&s;tabli&s;hing a national faith, is &s;till more unaccountable. With re&s;pect to faith, every man mu&s;t believe according to the evidence that is exhibited to him; he cannot help it. Such is the frame of the hu|man mind, that it cannot withhold its a&s;&s;ent or belief from any propo&s;ition that &s;hall appear to be true or probable. I evidently perceive, two and three make five; was I to gain the world, I cannot think otherwi&s;e. I have never been at Jamaica, yet I believe there is &s;uch a place; and that it lies in or near the particular latitude de&s;cribed in our maps: The te&s;timonies I have received of it are &s;o &s;trong, as force the belief of it, whether I will or not&punc; Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, the Athana&s;ian creed, and many other things I could mention, are truly my&s;terious and unin|telligible, and therefore cannot be properly the objects of the a&s;&s;ent of any rea&s;onable man. Was I to be threaten|ed with the &s;evere&s;t tortures, if I did not believe the&s;e doctrines, yet the fear of tho&s;e &s;evere puni&s;hments could not force me to the belief of them; it would be impo&s;|&s;ible for me to con&s;ider them any otherwi&s;e than as ab|&s;urd fal&s;ehoods. The dread of pain might induce me outwardly, to acknowledge them a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> true; but this would be no other than a wilful deliberate act of hypocri&s;y, for which I &s;hould &s;tand condemned in my own con&s;cience.</P>
<P>I will grant, the belief of a God is the foundation of all religion; there is no man who makes any u&s;e of his rea&s;on; but will conclude, that from eternity there mu&s;t have exi&s;ted &s;ome one, unchangeable, independent, ne|ce&s;&s;ary, &s;elf-exi&s;tent Being, from whom all other be|ings, and all other things, that are, or ever were, have
<PB N="62" REF="012728_0062_0F94DD497A8AC160">
received their original. It is demon&s;trably true, that all things could not have ri&s;en out of nothing; nor can they have derived from one another in an endle&s;s chain or &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Whatever exi&s;ts mu&s;t have a cau&s;e, a rea&s;on, a ground of its exi&s;tence; therefore, it is one of the mo&s;t evident truths in the world, that &s;omething mu&s;t have exi&s;ted eternally and independently: That is, (as Dr. Clarke very ju&s;tly ob&s;erves) to exi&s;t by an ab&s;olute ne|ce&s;&s;ity, originally in the nature of the thing. This is the mo&s;t natural idea of the Supreme Being; therefore I am forced to believe, that there is One only living and true God, a mo&s;t pure, glorious &s;pirit, nece&s;&s;arily po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing all po&s;&s;ible perfections, eternal, immen&s;e, immutable, al|mighty, omni&s;cient, independent, infinitely holy, ju&s;t and good.</P>
<P>Thus far the light of nature, una&s;&s;i&s;ted by revelation, points out and directs; and the more we con&s;ider and contemplate this &s;ubject, the &s;tronger we &s;hall find it im|pre&s;&s;ed in our minds: yea this truth is &s;o evident and demon&s;trable, that it comes with an irre&s;i&s;table power; &s;o that our a&s;&s;ent to it is nece&s;&s;ary and unavoidable.</P>
<P>Let us now examine the preten&s;ions of revelation, and we &s;hall find the ca&s;e exactly the &s;ame.</P>
<P>It is undeniably true, and we have all the proof and evidence that any rea&s;onable man can de&s;ire, that there really was &s;uch a per&s;on as Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and that he appeared in the world about 1700 years ago; that he was Je&s;us the Me&s;&s;iah; and was &s;ent out from God, and acted by the authority of God; that he came into the world to e&s;tabli&s;h a pure, &s;piritual and undefiled religion&punc; in its nature &s;imple and perfect, freed from &s;uper&s;tition and idolatry, not loaded with &s;acrifices or ceremonies, but every way adapted to make mankind wi&s;er and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">et|ter. The &s;ublimity of its doctrines, the purity of its pre|cepts, the &s;pirit of love, charity, and univer&s;al benevo|lence, that runs through the whole Chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem, obliges me to believe it has God for its author. Be&s;ides, the mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">les our Saviour wrought, in confirmation of his doctrine, were many, and unconte&s;table; performed in open day-light, in pre&s;ence of many hundred people; &s;o that there could not be the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of any fraud or juggle.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="012728_0063_0F94DD4A3A2C9400">
I am very &s;en&s;ible, 'tis natural for all men, to have a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> over-bearing opinion and e&s;teem of that particular reli|gion they were born and bred up in; but Chri&s;tianity will bear the &s;tricte&s;t enquiry, and &s;tand firm, when the mind is freed from all the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;s and prejudice of educa|tion. It calls on all its votaries to prove and examine it; and it has this particular di&s;tinction from all other religions what&s;oever; that the more it is in&s;pected into, the more its purity, rationality, and divine authority will appear: So that I am obliged, whether I will or not, to acknowledge the truth of our Saviour's mi&s;&s;ion, and the divinity of his doctrine: The proofs are &s;o inconte&s;table and conclu&s;ive, that it is not in my power to withhold my belief or a&s;&s;ent; &s;o that this faith al&s;o, like all others, is in its own nature nece&s;&s;ary and unavoidable. The&s;e pre|mi&s;es make it extremely difficult for me to conceive, that any one can be properly puni&s;hed or rewarded, either here or hereafter, merely for believing or not believing; and abundantly demon&s;trate, that the power claimed by the civil magi&s;trate, to e&s;tabli&s;h a national faith, is inde|fen&s;ible on rational principles, and not agreeable with the nature and ends of civil &s;ociety.</P>
<P>With regard to Chri&s;tianity, it is purely a practical thing, not a &s;peculative one. The Scriptures declare, that faith without works is dead. It avails not. It &s;igni|fies nothing. Let a man believe by the lump, let him &s;wallow creeds by dozens, let him believe all the ortho|dox e&s;tabli&s;hed notions, or all the orthodox opinions of the other different parties, yet, if he is an immortal man, he is wor&s;e than an infidel. A good life infers good prin|ciples. Living well is the be&s;t evidence we can give that we believe well. Certainly, an hone&s;t, &s;ober, virtu|ous Heathen, mu&s;t be more in the favour of God, than a wicked Chri&s;tian. A Pagan who ob&s;erves the laws of truth and peace, is infinitely more religious, than a pro|fane, turbulent, ava<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">itious Chri&s;tian Prie&s;t. Cornelius was a Heathen; yet, ob&s;erve, it is declared of him in Scripture, <HI>That he was a devout man, and one that feared God, with all his hou&s;e; who gave much a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ms to the peo|ple, and prayed to God Almighty.</HI></P>

The Clergy ought to be permitted to make &s;uch con|&s;titutions, from time to time, as &s;hall appear to them conducive to the ends of their divine commi&s;&s;ion; and the power of interpreting tho&s;e con&s;titutions and of carrying them into execution, ought to be inve&s;ted in the clergy alone, or in tho&s;e only to whom they &s;hall delegate it.</Q></P>
<P>Again, <Q>every Bi&s;hop may claim authority by the word of God, for the correction and puni&s;hing of &s;uch a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> are unquiet, di&s;obedient, and criminous; that is, for the exerci&s;e of all manner of &s;piritual di&s;cipline within his dioce&s;s. No admini&s;tration that is proper|ly &s;piritual, can come into any other hands what&s;oever, otherwi&s;e than by the voluntary choice and expre&s;s di|rection of the Bi&s;hop.</Q></P>
<P>I could quote &s;everal other pa&s;&s;ages, all endeavouring to prove that the Bi&s;hops and Clergy, by a Divine right, &s;tand inve&s;ted with the &s;ole power for the correction of manners, and puni&s;hment of vice; and that his authority is to be exerci&s;ed by vi&s;itations, &s;ynods, and rural chap|ters. Truly the tyranny of the Grand Turk is not &s;o dete&s;table. Who would not rather be a &s;lave to a Mon|arch than a monk? The experience of all ages confirms this truth, that the oppre&s;&s;ion or cruelty of temporal ty|rants never was, norever can be, &s;o great as that of Prie&s;ts has been; were tho&s;e claims pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">itted and allowed, the &s;acerdotal empire would &s;oon draw all power to it&s;elf, and render the civil magi&s;trate its &s;lave and dependant.

From the recognition and acknowledgement of this di|vine right &s;prang the Papal &s;upremacy; and &s;hould the Clergy of England ever po&s;&s;e&s;s a power or right of juri&s;|diction, underived from the civil magi&s;trate, it would lead us to a &s;tate and condition wor&s;e than being &s;laves to Rome; we &s;hould then become &s;laves and va&s;&s;als to a Popery at our own door. Tho&s;e Prie&s;tly claims and pre|ten&s;ions are in them&s;elves not only ab&s;urd, and dreadful|ly mi&s;chievous; but al&s;o directly oppo&s;ite to all the known laws and con&s;titutions of the realm. At the time of the Reformation our forefathers were not content to aboli&s;h the u&s;urped power of the Bi&s;hop of Rome, but went to the root of this accur&s;ed evil, and declared, that all ju|ri&s;diction, as well eccle&s;ia&s;tical, as civil, is ve&s;ted in, and exerci&s;ed by authority from the Crown.</P>
<P>3 Henry 8. <Q>His Royal Maje&s;ty is declared to be &s;u-&sect; 1. C. 17. preme head of the church of England, and hath full power to puni&s;h, and repre&s;s all manner of errors, vices and &s;ins, growing within the &s;ame.</Q></P>
<P>26 Henry 8. <Q>The King, his heirs and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, Chap. 1. &s;hall be taken and reputed the only &s;u|preme head on earth of the church of England, and have full power to correct, reform, and amend all er|rors and enormities within the &s;ame.</Q></P>
<P>1 Edward 6. <Q>It is declared, and enacted, that all &s;pi-Ch. 2. &sect; 3. ritual, juri&s;diction and authority is deriv|ed from the King's Maje&s;ty, as &s;upreme head of the churches in England and Ireland.</Q></P>
<P>1 Elizabeth, <Q>Be it enacted, that all juri&s;diction &s;pi-Ch. 1. &sect; 17. ritual, and eccle&s;ia&s;tical, be exerci&s;ed by her Maje&s;ty, and that &s;he hath full power and autho|rity for the vi&s;itation of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;tate, and per&s;ons, and for the reformation, order, and correcti|on of the &s;ame; and, further, that all manner of ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical power and juri&s;diction is in the Crown, and is exerci&s;ed by authority derived from thence.</Q></P>
<P>I could cite many other acts of Parliament, wherein it is mo&s;t fully and peremptorily declared, that Archbi&s;hops, Bi&s;hops, and all other eccle&s;ia&s;tical per&s;ons what&s;oever, have no manner of juri&s;diction, or authority, but by, un|der, and from the King, from whom alone all eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal

power is derived. Therefore, the Clergy &s;etting up for an independency, or pretending to exerci&s;e any &s;pi|ritual or temporal juri&s;diction, by virtue of a divine right, is directly contrary to all our known and e&s;tabli&s;h|ed laws, as well as incon&s;i&s;tent with all the principles of the reformation; which abundantly declare, that all &s;pi|ritual power and juri&s;diction is derived &s;olely from the civil magi&s;trate. This principle has ever been e&s;teem|ed the ground-work of the reformation. Whoever has a mind to &s;ee the weakne&s;s and pernicious tendency of tho&s;e prie&s;tly claims learnedly and judiciou&s;ly refuted, may con&s;ult that admirable treati&s;e, entitled, <HI>An exami|nation of the Codex,</HI> by that great Lawyer and true Eng|li&s;hman the late<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Now the honourable Mr. Ju&s;tice Fo&s;ter, one of the judges of the King's-Bench.</NOTE> recorder of Bri&s;tol. And le&s;t any one &s;hould think I bear too hard on tho&s;e Reverend Gentle|men, I beg leave to conclude with a quotation from this invaluable performance, Page 2. After having proved, beyond all contradiction, that Chri&s;t's kingdom was not of this world, but that it was an empire of truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s, founded in the hearts of his faithful &s;ub|jects, he goes on, <Q>For it is notorious; that a certain &s;et of men (meaning the Bi&s;hops and Clergy of ancient times) mo&s;t impudently a&s;&s;uming to them&s;elves the &s;ole interpretation of the laws of this kingdom, and pre|tending to an extraordinary zeal for the honour of its founder, did &s;et up, and for many ages did maintain, a kingdom of their own over the greate&s;t part of the Chri&s;tian world; the mo&s;t impious and oppre&s;&s;ive tyran|ny that ever exerci&s;ed the patience of God or men; an empire founded in craft, &s;upported by blood, rapine, breach of faith, and every other engine of fraud and oppre&s;&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P>I have now gone through what I fir&s;t intended, and to &s;peak the truth, what was at fir&s;t wrote for my own pri|vate amu&s;ement and without any de&s;ign of its &s;eeing the light; but when I con&s;idered what dreadful havock bi|gotry and &s;uper&s;tition had made in the Chri&s;tian world, I concluded, the publication might be of &s;ome u&s;e, and not un&s;ea&s;onable. My Lord Bacon's ob&s;ervation is cer|tainly
<PB N="72" REF="012728_0072_0F94DD4EBA64A390">
ju&s;tly, that the danger of &s;uper&s;tition is even greater than that of Athei&s;m: for, &s;ays he, <Q>Athei&s;m leaves men to &s;en&s;e, to philo&s;ophy, to laws, to reputation, all which may be guides to moral virtue, though reli|gion were not; but &s;uper&s;tition di&s;mounts all the&s;e; and erects an ab&s;olute monarchy in the minds of men; Therefore, Athei&s;m did never perturb &s;tates; but &s;u|per&s;tition hath been the confu&s;ion of many. The cau&s;es of &s;uper&s;tition are plea&s;ing and &s;en&s;ual rites and ceremonies, exce&s;s of phari&s;aical and out&s;ide holine&s;s, reverence to tradition, and the &s;tratagems of prelates for their own ambition and lucre.</Q></P>
<P>Probably, I may have incurred the di&s;plea&s;ure of &s;ome per&s;ons, by advancing things contrary to the commonly received opinions: But I beg leave &s;olemnly to declare, that my intention is perfectly innocent and ju&s;t. I de&s;ign nothing but the defence and &s;upport of the be&s;t religion, the be&s;t laws, and the be&s;t government in the world. I &s;ubmit all to the candour and good-nature of the r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ader, and do hope he will forgive what was hone&s;tly meant, although it &s;hould be found to be weakly executed. Should any one object, that I have taken too great liber|ties with the names and characters of the dead; I re|ply, that I am fully &s;en&s;ible of the rea&s;onablene&s;s and ju&s;tice of that ancient maxim, <HI>De mortuis nil ni&s;i bonum:</HI> However, this mu&s;t not extend to hi&s;tory, wherein for a ju&s;t recital of facts, the true and full characters of the principal agents are often requi&s;ite; and the hi&s;torian &s;hould be under no manner of re&s;traint, but that only of keeping within the bounds of truth and decency.</P>
