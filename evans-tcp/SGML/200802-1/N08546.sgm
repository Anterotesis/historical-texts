<BIBL>PSALM c1.6.</BIBL>
<Q>Mine Eyes &s;hall be upon the faithful of the Land, that they may dwell with me: He that walketh in a perfect Way, be &s;hall &s;erve me.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_ALL tho&s;e in whom is the &s;pirit of wi&s;|dom, are, in an influential manner &s;en|&s;ible, that the true pro&s;perity of &s;tates and kingdoms (under God) depends up|on the good qualifications of rulers and coun&s;ellors. Of this, king David was fully &s;en&s;ible; wherefore he determined to look well to the accom|pli&s;hments of tho&s;e whom he cho&s;e to &s;tand around him.</P>
<P>The words now read, and the p&s;alm in which they are contained, were compo&s;ed by David, between the times of God's promi&s;ing him the kingdom, and his actual and plenary po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it; which appears from the &s;econd ver&s;e, where he thus addre&s;&s;es him|&s;elf to God, O, when wilt thou come unto me? q. d. when wilt thou fulfil thy gracious promi&s;e, and give me to &s;it upon the throne of I&s;rael? He expre&s;&s;es a &s;ettled determination that no one &s;hould be admitted into his hou&s;e, as a dome&s;tic &s;ervant, or into his court as a coun&s;ellor, unle&s;s free from a vicious character&mdash;
<PB N="4" REF="010930_0003_0F852A5A33E21AC0">
free from an a&s;&s;uming, corrupt and deceitful mind and conduct. Mine eyes, &s;ays he, &s;hall be upon the faithful of the land (in conformity to my glorious antitype) upon tho&s;e who are governed by a &s;pirit of wi&s;dom, integrity and goodne&s;s, for in them is the fa|vourable pre&s;ence of God. The real and enduring pro&s;perity of the people are the mo&s;t likely to be &s;e|cured. No &s;tate or community on earth can flouri&s;h, or &s;ub&s;i&s;t, unle&s;s God is pre&s;ent to coun&s;el its coun&s;el|lors, and &s;ucceed their endeavours. Now, the pro|mi&s;e of his favourable pre&s;ence and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, is pe|culiarly to them that fear him, and walk, in his perfect way: Such therefore, were the per&s;ons upon whom holy David had his eyes, to &s;earch them out, to favour and advance them, from among the people, to fears of government. He well knew, that as the throne is e&s;tabli&s;hed by righteous&s;ne&s;s,<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Prov. xvi.13.</NOTE> tho&s;se who &s;urround it, mu&s;t walk in a perfect way. This was &s;o rivetted in his mind, that he repeatedly expre&s;&s;es his &s;ettled de|termination, to make him&s;elf a pattern, by ordering his conduct according to God's will, and entertain none in his court but &s;uch as walked by the &s;ame rule. It was not, with him, a &s;ufficient recommendation for high advancement, to be forward and warm in pur|&s;uit of it. To be of quick apprehen&s;ion, of polite addre&s;s, or learned in politics. Though the latter of the&s;e are good, yet the king after God's own heart, did not confine his views wholly here; he extended them farther in que&s;t of qualifications more divine and God-like. As God inve&s;ted him with a right to promote to honor and government, he e&s;teemed it ne|ce&s;&s;ary, in order to be free from abu&s;ing and forfeiting
<PB N="5" REF="010930_0003_0F852A5A33E21AC0">
this privilege, to &s;ee well to the real worth, and &s;uffici|ent accompli&s;hments of tho&s;e he called to public &s;er|vice in the &s;tate. This is highly worthy of our &s;eri|ous attention. Since God, in his good providence, has &s;een fit to indulge us in this colony with this pow|er, of electing our rulers, and this day calls us to the &s;ervice, we are bound, with impartiality and faithful|ne&s;s, as in the pre&s;ence of God, and accountable to him, to improve this privilege which was, and &s;till is in many places, the &s;ole prerogative of kings. Every abu&s;e of this mo&s;t valuable liberty, is a forfeiture&mdash;and a forfeiture may &s;oon be followed with total lo&s;s. But we may farther meditate upon this general ob|&s;ervation from the words, viz.</P>
<P><Q>That it is a duty incumbent on us, and on all who have a right to, and are active in advancing men to places of public tru&s;t and eminence, carefully to have our eyes upon, and give our &s;uffrages for tho&s;e who are well qulified, and are faithful.</Q> Here we may con&s;ider,</P>
<P>Who we are to view, and act for, as well quali|ed for public tru&s;t. Then,</P>
<P>Shew the duty and nece&s;&s;ity of giving our &s;uffrages for &s;uch, and con&s;ider &s;ome arguments for it.</P>
<P>Now, by the faithful and well qualified, we are not to under&s;tand tho&s;e only who are of our own particular ta&s;te, &s;entiments or party. 'Tis po&s;&s;ible a man may think and act in conformity to, and in conjuncti|on with us, and &s;till be unfaithful to his God, his country, and his king. A per&s;on may greedily adopt, and drink in our &s;cheme of religion and politicks, and yet be e&s;&s;entially unqualified for a public ruler.</P>
<P>Neither are we to confine this important character to tho&s;e who are peculiarly ob&s;equious to us. To
<PB N="6" REF="010930_0004_0F852A62827568E8">
tho&s;e who we imagine in all controver&s;ies in which we may be concerned will be ever ready to e&s;pou&s;e our cau&s;e, (whatever it is) and be &s;ervent and active in promoting us; our private intere&s;ts, or friends. This would favor too &s;trongly of &s;elf and party.</P>
<P>'Tis with much di&s;approbation St. Jude<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">V. 16. of his Epi&s;t.</NOTE> mentions &s;ome, who thus have men's per&s;ons in admiration, be|cau&s;e of advantage. So, we are not to under&s;tand by this, &s;uch only as are wi&s;e and faithful in their own matters, awake to their own per&s;onal intere&s;ts, and neglectful of the publick. But,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. We are to under&s;tand by the well qualified, men of approved varacity. I tru&s;t there is none of you my friends, but what think it worthy of your care, to elect tho&s;e to repre&s;ent and govern you, on who&s;e va|racity you may &s;afely rely: you would be fearful of repo&s;ing even the lea&s;t confidence in any you e&s;teem|ed defective in this point. Our public affairs, and particular circum&s;tances; call for a ju&s;t repre&s;entation: and &s;uch a repre&s;entation we can never be a&s;&s;ured of, either at home or abroad, unle&s;s our public concerns are committed into the hands of men po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this virtue. We &s;hall not be likely to have our real wants &s;upplied, or grievances redre&s;&s;ed, unle&s;s made known to &s;uch, as have the power of redre&s;&s;ing them in the light of truth. Tho&s;e who pre&s;ide in the republick or kingdom, mu&s;t be informed of the true &s;tate of the people, before they can mini&s;ter to them according to their needs. Doubtle&s;s, for want of due information, given to the heads of government, communities and &s;tates have often long groaned under calamities from which they might &s;oon have had relief, if matters of
<PB N="7" REF="010930_0004_0F852A62827568E8">
fact had been ju&s;tly related. We always need the help and &s;upports of truth. So Jethro coun&s;elled Mo&s;es,<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Exod. xviii.21.</NOTE> <HI>Thou &s;halt provide out of all the people, men of truth.</HI> Holy David &s;ays,<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">v. 7 cont.</NOTE> <HI>He that worketh deceit, &s;hall not dwell within my hou&s;e.</HI> This was a virtue Solomon had found very chearing and valuable in amba&s;&s;adors; he &s;ays,<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Prov. xiii.17.</NOTE> <HI>A faithful amba&s;&s;ador is health.</HI></P>
<P>Again, they mu&s;t be men of impartiality and ju&s;tice. God, the &s;upreme head of the univer&s;e, is a God of truth, and without iniquity,<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Deut. xxxii.4</NOTE> &s;o he delights in the&s;e virtues, and would have all the children of men po&s;|&s;e&s;s them&mdash;in an e&s;pecial manner tho&s;e who govern under him. He would have all under his government, partake the benefits of equity and ju&s;tice: wherefore he &s;ays,<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">2 Sam, xxiii.3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE> <HI>He that ruleth over men, mu&s;t be ju&s;t.</HI> As every per&s;on has an unalienable right to equity and ju&s;tice, rulers mu&s;t be &s;uch as will admi|ni&s;ter the&s;e, faithfully and impartially, and hear the &s;mall, and do them ju&s;tice as well as the great. If there is no proper regard to the&s;e in rulers, our e&s;tates, our mo&s;t valuable privileges, yea, our lives, will have but a very &s;lender &s;ecurity. We are bound to give our voices for &s;uch as we, with greate&s;t probability judge, will never de&s;ert the path of righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, or the common &s;afety, from the tear of frowns, the hope of rewards, or the adulations of the in&s;incere and de&s;igning. The prophet I&s;aiah<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">xxxiii, 15, 16.</NOTE> points out who is worthy, and &s;hall be owned of God. <HI>He that walketh righteou&s;ly&mdash;that de&s;pi&s;eth the gain of op|pre&s;&s;ions, that &s;haketh his hands from holding of bribes&mdash;he &s;hall dwell on high.</HI></P>
<P>Where there is a partial admini&s;tration, you may
<PB N="8" REF="010930_0005_0F852A6333236E40">
expect that the wicked will be promoted and ju&s;tified, and the righteous be overthrown in judgment. That the offending and vexatious will appear in high pla|ces, when the innocent, and his ju&s;t cau&s;e, &s;hall be neglected or turned a&s;ide. We can't rationally ex|pect that rulers who are partial, tempered in the heat of party, will properly concern them&s;elves for the good of the whole political body. Their peculiar friends and party intere&s;ts, will very much terminate their pur&s;uits, whil&s;t the general welfare is trampled upon. Not that they are to be regardle&s;s of individu|als, for they are to rule for the particular good of eve|ry one, which will encompa&s;s the whole; wherefore 'tis incumbent on us, to afford a promoting hand to &s;uch as are mo&s;t likely to conduct with due reference to the&s;e, and to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> herein. But,</P>
<P>Farther to an&s;we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> this character, they mu&s;t be men of found under&s;tanding, of firm and &s;teady re&s;oluti|on. It is evident, &s;uch us are ignorant of the things of our peace, cannot judiciou&s;ly, and with &s;ucce&s;s, pur&s;ue them. Though, 'tis true, there is a po&s;&s;ibili|ty of their taking right mea&s;ures; but who of us would be willing to ri&s;k his own, and the common &s;afety, upon a mere po&s;&s;ibility? Wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d it not be an argu|ment of weakne&s;s, &s;hould you place your mo&s;t valu|able mea&s;ures under the &s;lendere&s;&s; &s;ecurity? Would you hazard your own, and the public's ALL upon a weak and in&s;ufficient bottom? Would you, in a tem|pe&s;tuous &s;ea, commit your life, and every thing valu|able, to the guidance of an un&s;kilful pilot? To con|duct wi&s;ely, our care for the &s;ecurity of our valuable effects &s;hould be proportionate to their real valuable|ne&s;s. Wi&s;dom is a defence; more &s;o than many mighty.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="010930_0005_0F852A6333236E40">
There is a very rare compo&s;ition requi&s;ite to com|pleat the character of a well-accompli&s;hed and faithful ruler; but it is a compo&s;ition mo&s;t worthy of our cri|tical &s;earch: 'tis a compo&s;ition which (ble&s;&s;ed be God) may be found on earth. There is really need of a &s;pirit of wi&s;dom and under&s;tanding as well as of in|tegrity, in tho&s;e we con&s;titute fathers and protectors, of their country: unle&s;s our legi&s;lature are knowing, what will be our &s;y&s;tem for civil government and justice? the wi&s;e king of I&s;rael was &s;en&s;ible, that every other qualification &s;hort of this, would leave him very unfit for the head of government. That the &s;ucce&s;s and equity of his admini&s;trations depended heres wherefore in preference to all other &s;tate accompli&s;h|ments, he prays to God for this,<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">3 Kings iii.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> <HI>Give therefore thy &s;ervant an under&s;tanding heart, &amp;c.</HI> Men for rule mu&s;t have a &s;pirit of di&s;cernment. Able even at a di&s;tance to di&s;cover threatning evils, and avoid them; and things tending mo&s;t to the public emolument, and pur&s;ue them. I &s;hould account that per&s;on either unwi&s;e, or brought to &s;traits, who cho&s;e one blind for his guide. It was the direction of Mo&s;es to the people of I&s;rael,<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Deut. i.13.</NOTE> <HI>Take ye wi&s;e men, and under&s;tanding &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis evident a man's practical integrity and good|ne&s;s, can't exceed the bounds of his knowledge; wherefore the publick will have but little benefit from tho&s;e, who have but little under&s;tanding in politics.</P>
<P>So likewi&s;e there is required magnanimity and firmne&s;s of re&s;olution in our political heads. Where tho&s;e are wanting in any, our public and private intere&s;t would be very un&s;afe in their hands. The pre&s;ervation of our mo&s;t important and darling privi|leges
<PB N="10" REF="010930_0006_0F852A6582CDBE30" MS="y">
would be very precarious: for altho' 'tis no remarkable di&s;covery to &s;ee a per&s;on firm and re&s;olute in his endeavours for the &s;ecurity of his private inter|e&s;t; yet 'tis rare to find a man who will conduct thus, with regard to the common welfare. There is gene|ral cau&s;e of this apo&s;tolic complaint, "all &s;eek their own, &amp;c." tho' this may not be univer&s;al. Now the civil magi&s;trate would be very deficient, if de&s;titute of a publick &s;pirit, and true greatne&s;s of &s;oul: without this patriotic virtue, all our boa&s;ted privileges would be likely tamely to be given up, even upon the &s;lighte&s;t attack. There is a &s;pirit of fear, which God has not given, from which rulers &s;hould be free; and a &s;pirit of power, or fortitude &amp; of a &s;ound mind, which he has given, and which they &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s.<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. i.2.</NOTE></P>
<P>He who from &s;uch a &s;pirit of fear&mdash;from a &s;ecret hope of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">egal rewards, or aggrandi&s;ement, will de&s;ert and give up to ruin, the political edifice at it's fir&s;t apparent &s;hake, and leave his fellow &s;ubjects to be buried in its ruins, is too much like the unfaithful &s;hepherd, with much di&s;honour mentioned by our Saviour,<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">John x.1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> who even at the di&s;tant pro&s;pect of the de|vourer, was eager to give up to ruin, his defencele&s;s charge.</P>
<P>But on the other hand 'tis po&s;&s;ible they may be too adventrous&mdash;by being too precipitant in catch|ing hold to &s;ave the ark, they may be in&s;trumental in its overthrow. As the former may plunge them|&s;elves and the &s;tate in ruin for want of fortitude, and true publick &s;pirit; &s;o the&s;e by being too ardent, and con&s;equently too unguarded in their mea&s;ures, may prove equally fatal.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="010930_0006_0F852A6582CDBE30" MS="y">There is a proper medium between the&s;e extremes worth looking after&mdash;a medium which if we could be &s;o happy as to di&s;cover, and generally unite in, we might expect that the publick &s;afety would re&s;t upon the firme&s;t ba&s;is. So likewi&s;e tho&s;e who are un&s;ta|ble, and contiually wavering, even with the &s;malle&s;t breeze&mdash;who appear to do nothing by found judg|ment and &s;teady re&s;olution, are not likely to promote and &s;ecure the la&s;ting good of the community. You at once grant that &s;o re&s;pectable and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">onderous a fa brick requires the mo&s;t &s;olid foundation, and &s;up|ports. Con&s;cious of this, king Solomon leaves this direction to his &s;on and &s;ucce&s;&s;or,<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxiv.21</NOTE> <HI>Meddle not with them that are given to change.</HI></P>
<P>But we may go on to ob&s;erve, that the well accom|pli&s;hed for rule, mu&s;t be men of faithfulne&s;s: this holy David mentions as a &s;ummary of the good qua|lities of tho&s;e he determined &s;hould compleat his court and &s;erve in the &s;tate. <HI>Mine eyes,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>&s;hall be up|on the faithful</HI>&mdash;there is much contained in this&mdash;there is faithfulne&s;s to God&mdash;faithfulne&s;s in the temporal and &s;piritual intere&s;ts of the people. God, who&s;e dominion is univer&s;al, demands the fir&s;t and princi|pal regard of all; wherefore, we can't &s;uppo&s;e he who is negligent and regardle&s;s of his duty to him, will con&s;cientiou&s;ly di&s;charge his duty to his fellow men.</P>
<P>The civil magi&s;trate is &s;aid<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Rom xiii 4.</NOTE> <HI>to be the mini&s;ter of God:</HI> wherefore he &s;hould have his eye to him. Unle&s;s he believes that God is, can he obey him? he &s;hould ma|nife&s;t his faithfulne&s;s to him, by believing in him, as to that e&s;&s;ential mode of &s;ub&s;i&s;tance in which he has
<PB N="12" REF="010930_0007_0F852A6615A85F60">
revealed him&s;elf. By believing in Je&s;us Chri&s;t as the King eternal, and the only &s;aviour&mdash;by embracing his truths, and walking according to them. Now we can not &s;uppo&s;e that tho&s;e who are regardle&s;s of his laws, will regard man's. A &s;teady and uniform attendance to the duties which he owes to God, will recommend to publick confidence.</P>
<P>To add yet farther, we &s;hall do well to take a &s;ur|vey of the pa&s;t transactions and conduct of tho&s;e we endeavour to promote to dignified &s;tations. It is un|que&s;tionably a good recommendation for advance|ment, where any have been faithful in the places which they have filled heretofore, or fill now, and in the tru&s;ts which have been repo&s;ed in them. Such we may with a good degree of &s;afety continue to confide in. We may farther tru&s;t him, who has given &s;ufficient proof of his good abilities, and fidelity. But &s;hould we not be &s;u&s;picious of him, who had betrayed a tru&s;t, and e&s;teem him unworthy of future confidence? you would not readily tru&s;t to a bow, which had proved deceitful, or boldly tread where your feet had well nigh &s;lipt.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have evidenced a &s;erious concern for the publick good, and done all in their power to promote and &s;ecure it; (if otherwi&s;e qualified) bid the faire&s;t to an&s;wer the great ends of government. By pa&s;t faithfulne&s;s, they recommend them&s;elves, to honour|ary advancement, and more important tru&s;ts. Thus God in things &s;piritual, gives grace for grace. So our ble&s;&s;ed &s;aviour a&s;&s;erts this truth,<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">John xvi.10.</NOTE> <HI>He that is faith|ful in that which is lea&s;t, is faithful al&s;o in much.</HI> Like principles will mo&s;t probably govern him in greater
<PB N="13" REF="010930_0007_0F852A6615A85F60">
matters, which governed him in tho&s;e that were le&s;s, tho 'tis confe&s;&s;ed that not every one who is faithful in the lower offices of the &s;tate, is qualified for the highe&s;t&mdash;the&s;e may be too weighty for his &s;houlders. As hath been &s;hewn, there are other qualifications re|qui&s;ite: there mu&s;t be a good under&s;tanding, &amp; a publick &s;pirit; a &s;pirit of univer&s;al benevolence, which influences to an intimate concern for the good of the community, and of mankind in general.</P>
<P>The qualified patriot is ambitious not only to &s;erve him&s;elf, or a partial intere&s;t, but to build up, and en|tail la&s;ting happine&s;s to the common wealth&mdash;a hap|pine&s;s which &s;hall rejoice the hearts of ages, and ge|nerations, which come after him. He e&s;teems it con|temptible&mdash;'tis beneath him, to "coil him&s;elf up in his own contracted &s;hell." He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es true great|ne&s;s of &s;oul, which can't be confined to party, or fac|tion, but extends as far as po&s;&s;ible in promoting par|ticular, and publick happine&s;s. He is continually watchful for the pre&s;ervation of the religious and civil rights of the people; and contends earne&s;tly, and with per&s;everance, that the foundations may not be re|moved.</P>

<P>Rulers are to be nur&s;ing fathers to the church as well as to the &s;tate: wherefore they mu&s;t have a mo&s;t tender love and affection for it's head, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> all it's members: it &s;hould even be graven upon the palms of their hands, and lie nearer their hearts than children.

Other principles are un&s;table, and may &s;oon be &s;haken or rooted out of the mind, but the&s;e are e&s;tabli&s;hed upon an immoveable foundation.</P>

We ob&s;erve, in the hi&s;tory of the Jews, that when their chief rulers were really men of God, and ruled in his fear, they generally flouri&s;hed in &s;ucce&s;s and pro&s;perity, both in things &s;piritual and temporal. Ble&s;&s;ed art thou, O land! ble&s;&s;ed art thou, O Zion, and people of God, when &s;uch are exalted! Is this the ca&s;e with us? then our hopes for the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of our mo&s;t dear, &s;piritual enjoyments, and their being perpetuated, may triumph over our di&s;quieting fears of the irreparable lo&s;s of them. When rulers, in&s;tead of being examples of chri&s;tian faith and puri|ty, are examples of renouncing and &s;lighting the pe|culiar doctrines of grace, and the fundamental arti|cles of the chri&s;tian religion&mdash;when they are in prac|tice, examples of impiety, we may expect that &s;ur|prizing evils will en&s;ue&mdash;that error and wickedne&s;s will be prevalent, and the cau&s;e of the dear Redeemer be clad in mourning.</P>
<P>Mankind are greatly inclined to imitation; in an e&s;pecial manner, to imitate tho&s;e in places of emi|nence, and high life. Sen&s;ible of this, holy David re&s;olved to behave him&s;elf wifely, in a perfect way.<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">2. v. context.</NOTE> If their examples are bad, we may expect that the <HI>wick|ed will walk on every &s;ide,</HI> and that immorality will pre|vail like the &s;preading lepro&s;y. When the rulers among the people of the Jews were idolatrous, oppre&s;&s;ive or any ways notoriou&s;ly impious, impiety and wick|edne&s;s, even at once, in general deluged them. The real faults and imperfections of tho&s;e in di&s;tingui&s;h|ing &s;eats of government, and of the polite world, are, in the view of many of lower characters, and of tho&s;e who emulate them, even crowned with a
<PB N="16" REF="010930_0009_0F852A679531B090">
&s;anction, and imitated as really enobling: from whence the accur&s;ed thing which God hates, and which brings final ruin, lo&s;es it's malignity, and when thus fa&s;hionable, &s;acreligiou&s;ly puts on the pretended appearance of honor, and indicates a great and ad|ventrous &s;oul. When this is the ca&s;e with any peo|ple, what cau&s;e of lamentation and grief! <HI>O Term|pora, O Mores!</HI></P>
<P>The impiety of princes and rulers, has often proved the corruption and calamity of the &s;tate: this hi&s;tory both &s;acred and human, puts beyond di&s;pute.</P>
<P>We may now proceed to confider the duty of gi|ving our &s;uffrages for &s;uch as are thus well qualified for public tru&s;t, together with a few arguments (in addition to what have been noticed) exciting to it.</P>
<P>Now, we are bound to this, as it is the will of God, that tho&s;e who bear his name, &s;hould re&s;emble his moral character. Rulers are called Gods,<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Exod. xxii.38.</NOTE> from that faint re&s;emblance they bear to him, the &s;upreme Ruler. They are called thus, on account of the of|fice they are appointed to under him, to enact laws, to govern, to protect, and to admini&s;ter ju&s;tice; and it is his plea&s;ure that they &s;hould conduct worthy of this mo&s;t exalted and honorary title&mdash;that they &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s and honor all the moral perfections which be|long to the name. We may not only confider King David &s;peaking in the text, but Chri&s;t, the ble&s;&s;ed and only potentate, of whom he was eminently a type, and to whom his throne was promi&s;ed. It is requir|ed by him, that tho&s;e who are to rule for him, &s;hould be faithful, and walk in a perfect way. Yea, that all his &s;ubjects &s;hould, as far as po&s;&s;ible po&s;&s;e&s;s, and exhibit
<PB N="17" REF="010930_0009_0F852A679531B090">
all his mo&s;t glorious moral excellencies. In an e&s;pecial manner, rulers as his mini&s;ters, mu&s;t like him be no re&s;pecters of per&s;ons, but imitate his mo&s;t amiable character, by doing ju&s;tly, loving mercy, and walk|ing humbly with their God.</P>
<P>Again, we &s;hould be animated to this, becau&s;e 'tis our duty and wi&s;dom, wi&s;ely to improve our privileges. It is a privilege truly great, for a people to have the free election of tho&s;e that have the immediate rule over them; and it has ever been accounted and prov|ed &s;o, by tho&s;e who have had this power, and duly improved it. That people who&s;e rulers are appointed by tho&s;e who&s;e di&s;tance nece&s;&s;arily keeps them in a de|gree unacquainted with their particular circum&s;tances, (without any hurtful de&s;ign in tho&s;e that appoint them) are doubly liable to have &s;uch &s;et over them, as care more for ab&s;olute dominion, and increa&s;e of wealth, than for ju&s;tice and equity, or the real pro&s;|perity of the community; perhaps for in&s;tances of this kind, we need not look into di&s;tant climes, or ancient records. Are not &s;uch more likely to bind heavy bur|thens upon mens &s;houlders, than tho&s;e cho&s;en by the people out of their own tribes, members incorporated in the &s;ame body?</P>
<P>But in the good providence of God, and clemency of our rightful King, we in this colony live in the free|e&s;t part of a kingdom, the be&s;t con&s;tituted of any of the kingdoms of the earth. Wherefore we are faith|fully to improve this liberty, and endeavour by all war|rantable mea&s;ures to have it perpetuated. Every a|bu&s;e of it is impious, and expo&s;es to a total, irreco|verable deprivation. And if this is lo&s;t by our mi&s;con|duct, or abu&s;e of it, the evil con&s;equences will ju&s;tly return upon our own heads.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="010930_0010_0F852A68559F9560">
But to proceed, we do well to con&s;ider that our mo&s;t important intere&s;ts (under God) are put into their hands&mdash;yea, the highe&s;t intere&s;ts of every one of us. Rulers are not merely for the benefit of any particular per&s;on or party, but for the whole commu|nity. Every member of it (as &s;uch) has an equal right in them; &s;o that if we &s;trive to rai&s;e tho&s;e into place, whom we imagine will be partial in favour of us, and of tho&s;e that think with us, to the ne|glect of others, we act unrighteou&s;ly, and endea|vour, to prevent others from their unalienable right. Now &s;ince every individual, and &s;o the whole body is to be cared for, if we act from partial views, for favourers of a party, we counteract this plain direc|tion, <HI>Look not every man on his own things, but every man al&s;o on the things of others.</HI> We are bound by all legal mea&s;ure, to promote our own, and others good and happine&s;s. Surely, you would not be willing to commit your mo&s;t valuable effects, or tho&s;e of your friends, to the cu&s;tody of one who was unfaithful, and would embezzel and de&s;troy them&mdash;to one weak and unable to defend them, or to one who would attend to ill advice and de&s;ert them. We learn that by weakne&s;s and ill advice, Rehoboam took mea&s;ures which occa|&s;ioned the revolt of ten of the tribes of I&s;rael.</P>
<P>So farther, you may con&s;ider that the ble&s;&s;ing of God is mo&s;t likely to come to a people in, and attend the admini&s;trations of good and faithful rulers. As he loves righteou&s;ne&s;s and hates iniquity, &s;o he loves tho&s;e that work righteou&s;ne&s;s, and in this &s;ervice he will e&s;tabli&s;h their ways. Such as are wi&s;e and holy, have a peculiar promi&s;e of his favourable pre&s;ence, and he will in&s;truct them. David &s;ays, <HI>the &s;ecret of the Lord is with them that fear him, and he will teach
<PB N="19" REF="010930_0010_0F852A68559F9560">
them.</HI> So we find that God would not hide from faithful Abraham, the thing he was about to do to Sodom.<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Gen. xviii.19.</NOTE> The holy records inform us, that he has &s;ignally ble&s;&s;ed his people, when their rulers were ju&s;t, ruling in his fear, he is with them in the judgment. When this is at any time the ca&s;e with us, we may ex|pect that the Lord of ho&s;ts will be for a crown of glo|ry, and for a diadem of beauty unto us; and for a &s;pirit of judgment to him that &s;itteth in judgment.<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. xxviii.5, 6</NOTE></P>
<P>This likewi&s;e &s;hould be a moving con&s;ideration to the pre&s;ent duty, that as rulers are to rule for God, we have bound our&s;elves by free &amp; &s;olemn oath, to help him by giving our votes as in our con&s;cience we judge mo&s;t for the good of this government, without re&s;pect of per&s;ons, or favour of any man. Now is &s;uch an oath binding? if it is, we are guilty of a mo&s;t aggravated crime in counteracting it:&mdash;a crime of too deep a &s;tain to be ea&s;ily effaced. Is it not to be feared this is often much too little regarded, and that favourite men and &s;chemes unrea&s;onably bia&s;s our minds, and bear us away from the path of duty?</P>
<P>To add yet farther, we do well to con&s;ider, in the elections of this day, that we are to be &s;ubject unto tho&s;e who are by us advanced to &s;eats of rule. God commands us to be &s;ubject to principalities and pow|ers, and to obey magi&s;trates; &s;ince this &s;ubjection and obedience is required of us, it highly concerns us to endeavour to promote tho&s;e, to whom we may chearfully &s;ubmit, and to whom we may do &s;ervice as unto the Lord.&mdash;Not that we owe pa&s;&s;ive and blind obedience to all their commands, without any quali|fication&mdash;where their commands are contray to God's we are bound in con&s;cience to refrain from them. When Saul told Jonathan that he &s;hould &s;urely die,
<PB N="20" REF="010930_0011_0F852A691525B628" MS="y">
it being unju&s;t, the people &s;aid, <HI>As the Lord liveth, there &s;hall not an hair of his head fall.</HI> It is their ju&s;t and righteous commands which we are bound by, and if they are not &s;uch, then we mu&s;t &s;ee that we obey God rather than men.</P>
<P>But finally.&mdash;We &s;hould bear it upon our minds that we mu&s;t account with God for this day's tran&s;ac|tions. This &s;hould be a powerful incentive to a con|&s;cientious attendance to the &s;ervices of it&mdash;that God, who at one view pervades the univer&s;e, who &s;earches the hearts, who knows all our ways, all our mo&s;t &s;e|cret &s;prings of action, will &s;oon call us before his aw|ful tribunal. Let this mo&s;t &s;olemn thought, excite us to a wi&s;e improvement of all our advantages&mdash;to an uniform, and &s;teady attendence to all the parts of our duty, and engage us now and ever to conduct in the fear of God, in the uprightne&s;s and integrity of our &s;ouls, For happy&mdash;forever happy and ble&s;&s;ed will tho&s;e &s;ervants be, whom their Lord when he cometh <HI>&s;hall find &s;o doing.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall now conclude with a few inferences from what has been &s;aid.</P>
<P N="1">Fir&s;t. We from hence learn, that we &s;hould endea|vour to obtain a ju&s;t knowledge of the good accom|pli&s;hments of tho&s;e we elect to repre&s;ent, and rule over us. Mo&s;es commanded the people <HI>to take men for &s;ervice in the commonwealth, who were known among their tribes &amp;c.</HI> who&s;e good qualifications they were well a&s;&s;ured of. We act in the dark, and at too great a ri&s;k, if ignorant of tho&s;e we give our voices for. If &s;uch a knowledge cannot readily be obtained, 'tis worthy of labour in pur&s;uing after it, as we can't act according to the character of moral agents in this af|fair without a degree of it.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="010930_0011_0F852A691525B628" MS="y">But as you are unable, univer&s;ally, to have the be|nefit of per&s;onal acquantaince, with &s;uch as you call to publick &s;ervice in the &s;tate, you will be ready to enquire how you may attain to &s;uch a knowledge? to this I reply; Not from tho&s;e who are leading and hot in a party; it would be even a prodigy, to re|ceive a ju&s;t and impartial character from &s;uch; for we find it frequently (not to &s;ay univer&s;ally) true, that of whatever party they are, they are prone to give us partial information&mdash;You may predetermine, that men to their liking will be warmly recommended to yours; and tho&s;e foreign from their ta&s;te will if po&s;|&s;ible, be &s;owered to the ta&s;te of every body el&s;e. See|ing this is &s;o frequently di&s;coverable among us, we need be cautious upon who&s;e recommendation we rely. There is occa&s;ion almo&s;t univer&s;ally, where parties run high, to make more or le&s;s abatements, as we &s;ee the parties characterized, prejudiced for, or a|gain&s;t tho&s;e whom they characterize. It is an ob&s;er|vation which will generally bear, that in all warm con|trover&s;ies, you will find truth growing in greate&s;t plenty in the happy medium.</P>
<P N="2">2d. Are rulers God's mini&s;ters, bearing his name? then we &s;hould not ra&s;hly &s;peak evil of them. We ought in regard to them, and to him who &s;ent them, to &s;peak of, and conduct towards them, with due re&s;pect and reve|rence. Should we indulge our&s;elves upon every trivial occa&s;ion to &s;peak evil of them, we &s;hould tran&s;gre&s;s the commandment of God. 'Tis &s;aid, <HI>thou &s;halt not revile the Gods.</HI> And again, <HI>thou &s;halt not &s;peak evil of the ruler of thy people.</HI> This is not only a violation of the divine law, but tends to bring them into contempt&mdash;to alienate peo|ple's minds from them, and &s;ubvert government. Railing came &s;o much in contra&s;t with the meeckne&s;s
<PB N="22" REF="010930_0012_0F852A69DC9C7E50">
of Mo&s;es, that he could not practi&s;e it, even again&s;t the common adver&s;ary. The apo&s;tle Jude, paints the guilt of tho&s;e who &s;peak evil of dignities in a crim&s;on dye. It is not from hence to be under&s;tood, that we are obliged to refrain from opening our mouths in di&s;ap|proving them, in order to obtain relief, &s;uppo&s;ing they are really hurtful and oppre&s;&s;ive. There is a way open for us to &s;eek for, and obtain deliverance, from oppre&s;&s;ive and wicked rulers; the law is above the highe&s;t of them. But if we have occa&s;ion at any time to prote&s;t again&s;t their mea&s;ures, it &s;hould be in the temper of meekne&s;s; not with haughty arrogance and clamorous bitterne&s;s: to pretend to judge and condemn them as evil, with our private deci&s;ion, would be conducting, as tho' we partook of the di|vine prerogative to pour contempt upon princes; <HI>to lead coun&s;ellors away Spoiled, and to make the judges fools.</HI> By &s;peaking reproachfully of rulers, as being weak, unfaithful or wicked, we reproach the body of the people by whom they are elected; yea, we even reproach our&s;elves, being members of this body. If they conduct unju&s;tly, contrary to the fundamental rules of government, they are not above the law; but in a legal method are to be pointed to the path, and rou&s;ed to a &s;en&s;e of duty, in that temper of charity which the go&s;pel is full of.</P>
<P N="3">3d. Hence, (if the things mentioned render a per&s;on well accompli&s;hed for a ruler) 'tis evident that no particular place of abode in the community can di&s;qualify him. If any particular &s;pot of ground can qualify for publick &s;ervice, then tho&s;e who have a laudable ambition for this &s;ervice, mu&s;t with un|wearied application &s;earch for it; yea, they mu&s;t even &s;ell all that they have to purcha&s;e it. This is too trifling a matter for the lea&s;t contention. Tho' a
<PB N="23" REF="010930_0012_0F852A69DC9C7E50">
principal ruler in the ea&s;tern, or we&s;tern part of the government, may perhaps, honor tho&s;e more frequent|ly with his pre&s;ence and breath, who dwell near his qualifing place of abode, yet of how much more im|portance is it to all who belong to the community to be honoured, and ble&s;&s;ed with his ju&s;t and equitable admini&s;trations?</P>
<P N="4">4th. Since every member of our corporation has an equal right with others in public rulers, we counteract equity &amp; ju&s;tice, if in our elections we are governed by &s;elf or any particular party. 'Tis manife&s;t that party contentions and prejudices in any &s;ociety or common|wealth, are of mo&s;t di&s;quieting, &amp; hurtful con&s;equences, and a &s;mall acquaintance with our public affairs, will convince that the pre&s;ent times are not free from them&mdash;can a kingdom or hou&s;e divided again&s;t it&s;elf &s;tand? Now when apprehen&s;ive of a fatal di&s;ea&s;e, an antidote may pre&s;erve health and life. When the natural body is in pain; and convul&s;ed, there is need of &s;ome &s;pecific; &s;o there is much incumbent on e|very one, to promote the health and quietude of the political body. In the&s;e days of foreign &amp; dome&s;tic di&s;putes, we &s;hould all (if from nothing el&s;e) from the principle of &s;elf pre&s;ervation, be moved to throw by all party &s;pirit&mdash;to ca&s;t out this old man with his deeds, &amp; unite all our vigorous endeavovrs for the publick &s;afety. The times are &s;uch that we verily want the wi&s;e&s;t heads and the uprighte&s;t hearts; and if we and all the re&s;t of the freemen in this colony, could in this, be of one heart, and do nothing thro' &s;trife or partiality, we might rea&s;onably hope, that our peace would be as a river, and our pro&s;perity like that of the field which the Lord hath ble&s;&s;ed. <HI>But if ye bite and devour one a|nother, take heed that ye be not con&s;umed one of another.</HI></P>
