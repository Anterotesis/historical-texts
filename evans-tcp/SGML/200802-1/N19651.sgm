<P><HI>IT is &s;aid,</HI> a book &s;hould be read with the &s;ame &s;pirit with which it has been written. <HI>In that ca&s;e, fatal mu&s;t be the reception of this&mdash;for the writer frankly avows, that during the time &s;he has been writing it, &s;he has &s;uffered every quality and degree of wearine&s;s and la&s;&s;itude, into which no other employment could have betrayed her.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It has been the de&s;tiny of the writer of this Story, to be occupied throughout her life, in what has the lea&s;t &s;uited either her inclination or capacity&mdash;with an invincible im|pediment in her &s;peech, it was her lot for thirteen years to gain a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence by public &s;peaking&mdash;and, with the utmo&s;t dete&s;tation of the fatigue of inventing, a con&s;titu|tion &s;uffering under a &s;edentary life, and an education confined to the narrow boundaries pre&s;cribed her &s;ex, it has been her fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> to devote a tedious &s;even years to the unremitting labour of literary productions&mdash;whil&s;t a ta&s;te for authors of the fir&s;t rank has been an additional pu|ni&s;hment, forbidding her one moment of tho&s;e &s;elf-approving reflections which are a&s;&s;uredly due to the indu&s;trious.&mdash;But, alas! in the exerci&s;e of the arts, indu&s;try &s;carce bears the name of merit.&mdash;What then is to be &s;ub&s;tituted in the place of genius?</HI> GOOD FORTUNE.&mdash;<HI>And if the&s;e volumes &s;hould be attended by the good fortune that has accompanied her other writings, to that divinity, and that alone, &s;he &s;hall attribute their &s;ucce&s;s.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Yet, there is a</HI> fir&s;t cau&s;e <HI>&s;till, to whom I cannot here forbear to mention my obligations.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Mu&s;es, I tru&s;t, will pardon me, that to them I do not feel my&s;elf obliged&mdash;for, inju&s;tice to their heavenly in&s;pirations, I believe they have never yet favoured me with one vi&s;itation; but &s;ent in their di&s;gui&s;e</HI> NECESSITY,

<HI>who, being the Mother of Invention, gave me all mine&mdash;while</HI> FORTUNE <HI>kindly &s;miled, and was acce&s;&s;ary to the cheat.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But this important &s;ecret I long wi&s;hed, and endea|voured to conceal; yet one unlucky moment candidly, though unwittingly, divulged it&mdash;I frankly owned, "That Fortune having cha&s;ed away Nece&s;&s;ity, there remained no other incitement to &s;timulate me to a labour I abhorred."&mdash;It happened to be in the power of the per&s;on to whom I confided this &s;ecret, to &s;end</HI> NECESSITY <HI>once more.&mdash;Once more, then, bowing to its empire, I &s;ubmit to the ta&s;k it enjoins.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<P>DORRIFORTH bred at St. Omer's in all the &s;chola&s;tic rigour of that college, was by education, and the &s;olemn vows of his order, a Roman Catho|lic prie&s;t&mdash;but nicely di&s;criminating between the philo&s;ophical and the &s;uper&s;titious part of that cha|racter, and adopting the former only, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed qualities not unworthy the fir&s;t profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;|tianity&mdash;every virtue which it was his vocation to preach, it was his care to practi&s;e; nor was he in the cla&s;s of tho&s;e of the religious, who, by &s;eclud|ing them&s;elves from the world, fly the merit they might have in reforming mankind. He refu&s;ed to &s;helter him&s;elf from the temptations of the layman by the walls of a cloi&s;ter, but &s;ought for, and found that &s;helter in the centre of London, where he dwelt, in his own prudence, ju&s;tice, fortitude, and temperance.</P>
<P>He was about thirty, and had lived in the me|tropolis near five years, when a gentleman, above his own age, but with whom he had from his youth contracted a mo&s;t &s;incere friend&s;hip, died, and left
<PB N="2" REF="025650_0005_0FCEB0E6638E3BE0">
him the &s;ole guardian of his daughter, a young lady of eighteen.</P>
<P>The decea&s;ed Mr. Milner, on his approaching di&s;|&s;olution, perfectly &s;en&s;ible of his &s;tate, thus rea&s;oned to him&s;elf before he made the nomination: "I have formed no intimate friend&s;hip during my whole life, except one&mdash;I can be &s;aid to know the heart of no man except the heart of Dorriforth&mdash;After know|ing this, I never &s;ough acquaintance with another&mdash;I did not wi&s;h to le&s;&s;en the exalted e&s;timation of human nature he had in&s;pired. In this moment of trembling apprehen&s;ion from every thought that darts acro&s;s my mind, much more for every action which &s;oon I mu&s;t be called to an&s;wer for; all world|ly views here thrown a&s;ide, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">act as if that tribunal before which I every moment expect to appear, were now &s;itting in judgment upon my purpo&s;e.&mdash;The care of an only child is the great charge that in this tremendous cri&s;is I have to execute&mdash;the&s;e earthly affections that bind me to her by cu&s;tom, &s;ympathy, or what I fondly call parental love, would direct me to &s;tudy her pre&s;ent happine&s;s, and leave her to the care of &s;ome of tho&s;e &s;he &s;tyles her dear|e&s;t friends; but they are friends only in the &s;un|&s;hine of fortune; in the cold nipping fro&s;t of di&s;|appointment, &s;ickne&s;s, or connubial &s;trife, they will for&s;ake the hou&s;e of care, although the hou&s;e which they them&s;elves may have built."</P>
<P>Here the excruciating angui&s;h of the father, over|came that of the dying man.</P>
<P>"In the moment of de&s;ertion," continued he, "which I now picture to my&s;elf, where will my child find comfort?&mdash;That heavenly aid religion gives, which now, amid&s;t the&s;e agonizing tortures, cheers with the bright ray of con&s;olation my fright|ened &s;oul; that, &s;he will be denied."</P>
<P>It is in this place proper to remark, that Mr.
<PB N="3" REF="025650_0006_0FCEB0E7B8028428">
Milner was a member of the church of Rome, but on his marriage with a lady of Prote&s;tant tenets, they mutually agreed their &s;ons &s;hould be educated in the religious opinion of their father, and their daughters in that of their mother. One child only was the re&s;ult of their union, the child who&s;e fu|ture welfare now occupied the thoughts of her ex|piring father&mdash;from him the care of her education had been with-held, as he kept inviolate the pro|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">i&s;e made to her departed mother on the article of religion, and therefore con&s;igned his daughter to a Prote&s;tant boarding-&s;chool, from whence &s;he was &s;ent with merely &s;uch &s;entiments of religion, as young ladies of fa&s;hion mo&s;tly imbibe. Her little heart employed in all the endle&s;s pur&s;uits of per|&s;onal accompli&s;hments, had left her mind without one ornament, except tho&s;e which nature gave, and even they were not wholly pre&s;erved from the ravages made by its rival, <HI>Art.</HI></P>
<P>While her father was in health he beheld with the extreme of delight, his accompli&s;hed daughter without one fault with which ta&s;te or elegance could have reproached her, nor ever enquired what might be her other failings&mdash;Ca&s;t on a bed of &s;ickne&s;s, and upon the point of leaving her to her future fate, tho&s;e failings at once ru&s;hed on his memory&mdash;and all the pride, the fond enjoyment he had taken in beholding her open the ball, or delight her hearers with her &s;prightly wit, e&s;caped his remembrance; or not e&s;caping, were thought of with a &s;igh of contrition, or at be&s;t a contemptuous frown, at the frivolous qualification.</P>
<P>"Something more e&s;&s;ential," &s;aid he to him&s;elf, "mu&s;t be con&s;idered&mdash;&s;omething to prepare her for an hour like this I now experience&mdash;can I then leave her to the charge of tho&s;e who them&s;elves never remember &s;uch an hour will come?&mdash;Dorriforth is
<PB N="4" REF="025650_0007_0FCEB0E944656978">
the only per&s;on I know, who, uniting every moral virtue to tho&s;e of religion, and native honour to pious faith; will protect without controuling, in|&s;truct without tyrannizing, comfort without flat|tering, and perhaps in time make good by choice, rather than by con&s;traint, the dear object of his dying friend's &s;ole care."</P>
<P>Dorriforth, who came po&s;t from London to vi&s;it Mr. Milner, in his illne&s;s, received a few moments before his death all his injunctions, and promi&s;ed to fulfil them&mdash;but in this la&s;t token of Mr. Milner's perfect e&s;teem of his friend, he &s;till re&s;trained him from all authority to direct his ward in one religious opinion contrary to tho&s;e her mother had profe&s;&s;ed, and in which &s;he her&s;elf had been educated.</P>
<P>"Never perplex her mind with an idea that may di&s;turb, but cannot reform"&mdash;were his late&s;t words, and Dorriforth's reply gave him entire &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner was not with her father at this af|fecting period&mdash;&s;ome delicately nervous friend, with whom &s;he was on a vi&s;it at Bath, thought proper to conceal from her not only the danger of his death, but even his indi&s;po&s;ition, le&s;t it might alarm a mind &s;he thought too &s;u&s;ceptible. This refined tenderne&s;s gave poor Mi&s;s Milner the almo&s;t in&s;up|portable agony, of hearing her father was no more, even before &s;he was told he was not in health. In the bittere&s;t angui&s;h &s;he flew to pay her la&s;t duty to his remains, and performed it with the true&s;t filial love, while Dorriforth, upon important bu&s;ine&s;s, was obliged to return to town.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER II.</HEAD>
<P>DORRIFORTH returned to London heavily afflicted for the lo&s;s of his friend, and yet perhaps
<PB N="5" REF="025650_0008_0FCEB0EB82B5A250">
with his thoughts more engaged upon the tru&s;t that friend had repo&s;ed in him. He knew the life Mi&s;s Milner had been accu&s;tomed to lead; he dreaded the repul&s;es his admonitions might po&s;&s;ibly meet from her; and feared he had undertaken a ta&s;k he was too weak to execute&mdash;the protection of a young woman of fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>Mr. Dorriforth was nearly related to one of our fir&s;t Catholic peers; his income was by no means confined, but approaching to affluence, yet his at|tention to tho&s;e in poverty, and the moderation of his own de&s;ires were &s;uch, that he lived in all the careful plainne&s;s of oeconomy&mdash;his habitation was in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> hou&s;e of a Mrs. Horton, an elderly lady, who had a maiden niece re&s;iding with her not many years younger than her&s;elf&mdash;But although Mi&s;s Woodley was thirty, and in per&s;on exceedingly plain, yet &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;uch an extreme cheerfulne&s;s of temper, and &s;uch an inexhau&s;tible fund of good nature, that &s;he e&s;caped not only the ridicule, but even the appellation, of an old maid.</P>
<P>In this hou&s;e Dorriforth had lived before the death of Mr. Horton, nor upon that event did he think it nece&s;&s;ary, notwith&s;tanding his religious vow of celibacy, to fly the roof of two &s;uch un|&s;eductive innocent females as Mrs. Horton and her niece&mdash;on their part, they regarded him with all that re&s;pect and reverence the mo&s;t religious flock regards its pa&s;tor; and his friendly &s;ociety they not only e&s;teemed a &s;piritual, but a temporal advantage, as the liberal &s;tipend he allowed for his apartments and board enabled them to continue in the large and commodious hou&s;e where they had re&s;ided du|ring the life of Mr. Horton.</P>
<P>Here, upon Mr. Dorriforth's return from his journey, preparations were made for the reception of his ward, her father having made it one of his
<PB N="6" REF="025650_0009_0FCEB0ED35033E48">
reque&s;ts that &s;he might, for a time at lea&s;t, dwell in the &s;ame hou&s;e with her guardian, receive the &s;ame vi&s;its, and cultivate the acquaintance of his acquaintances and friends.</P>
<P>When the will of her father was made known to Mi&s;s Milner, &s;he &s;ubmitted without the &s;malle&s;t re|luctance to all he had required&mdash;her mind, at that time impre&s;&s;ed with the mo&s;t poignant &s;orrow for his lo&s;s, made no di&s;tinction of happine&s;s that was to come; and the day was appointed, with her &s;ilent acquie&s;cence, when &s;he was to arrive in London, and take up her abode at Mrs. Horton's, with all the retinue of a rich heire&s;s.</P>
<P>Mrs. Horton was delighted with the addition this acqui&s;ition to her family was likely to make to her annual income, and to the &s;tyle of her living.&mdash;The good-natured Mi&s;s Woodley was overjoyed at the expectation of their new gue&s;t, yet &s;he her&s;elf could not tell why&mdash;but the rea&s;on was, her kind heart wanted more ample field for its benevolence; and now her thoughts were all plea&s;ingly employed how &s;he &s;hould render, not only the lady her&s;elf, but even all her attendants, happy in their new &s;itua|tion.</P>
<P>The thoughts of Dorrriforth were le&s;s agreeably engaged&mdash;Cares, doubts, fears, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his mind&mdash;&s;o forcibly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it, that upon every occa&s;ion which offered, he would inqui&s;itively try to gain intelligence of his ward's di&s;po&s;ition before he &s;aw her; for he was, as yet, a &s;tranger not only to the real propen&s;ities of her mind, but even to her per|&s;on; a con&s;tant round of vi&s;its having prevented his meeting her at her father's, the very few times he had been at his hou&s;e, &s;ince her return from boarding-&s;chool. The fir&s;t per&s;on who&s;e opinion he, with all proper re&s;erve, a&s;ked concerning Mi&s;s
<PB N="7" REF="025650_0010_0FCEB0EE7674DF48">
Milner was lady Evans, the widow of a baronet who frequently vi&s;ited at Mrs. Horton's.</P>
<P>But that the reader may be intere&s;ted in what Dorriforth &s;ays and does, it is nece&s;&s;ary to give &s;ome de&s;cription of his per&s;on and manners. His figure was tall and elegant, but his face, except a pair of dark bright eyes, a &s;et of white teeth, and a grace|ful fall in his clerical curls of dark brown hair, had not one feature to excite admiration&mdash;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed notwith&s;tanding &s;uch a gleam of &s;en&s;ibility diffu&s;ed over each, that many people mi&s;took his face for hand&s;ome, and all were more or le&s;s attracted by it&mdash;in a word, the charm that is here meant to be de&s;cribed is a countenance&mdash;on his countenance you beheld the feelings of his heart&mdash;&s;aw all its inmo&s;t workings&mdash;the quick pul&s;es that beat with hope and fear, or the placid ones that were &s;tationary with patient re&s;ignation. On this countenance his thoughts were pictured, and as his mind was enriched with every virtue that could make it valuable, &s;o was his hone&s;t face adorned with every emblem of tho&s;e virtues&mdash;and they not only gave a lu&s;tre to his a&s;pect, but added a harmonious &s;ound to all he uttered; it was per&s;ua&s;ive, it was perfect eloquence, whil&s;t in his looks you beheld his thoughts moving with his lips, and ever coinciding with what he &s;aid.</P>
<P>With one of tho&s;e intere&s;ting looks which reveal|ed the anxiety of his heart, and with that graceful re&s;traint of all ge&s;ticulation, for which he was re|markable even in his mo&s;t anxious concerns, he ad|dre&s;&s;ed lady Evans who had called on Mrs. Horton to hear and to tell the news of the day: Your lady&s;hip was at Bath la&s;t &s;pring&mdash;you know the young lady to whom I have the honour of being appointed guardian.&mdash;Pray"&mdash;</P>
<P>He was earne&s;tly intent upon a&s;king a que&s;tion, but was prevented by her lady&s;hip.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="025650_0011_0FCEB0F14DF29650">
"Dear Mr. Dorriforth, do not a&s;k me any thing about the lady&mdash;when I &s;aw her &s;he was very young: though indeed that is but three months ago, and &s;he can't be much older now."</P>
<P>"She is eighteen," an&s;wered Dorriforth, colour|ing with regret at the doubts her lady&s;hip had in|crea&s;ed, but not in&s;pired.</P>
<P>"And &s;he is very beautiful, that I can a&s;&s;ure you," replied her lady&s;hip.</P>
<P>"Which I call no qualification," &s;aid Dorriforth, ri&s;ing from his &s;eat in evident unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>"But where there is nothing el&s;e," returned lady Evans; "let me tell you, beauty is &s;omething."</P>
<P>"Much wor&s;e than nothing, in my opinion," returned Dorriforth.</P>
<P>"But now, Mr. Dorriforth, do not from what I have &s;aid, frighten your&s;elf, and imagine the young lady wor&s;e than &s;he really is&mdash;all I know of her, is merely that &s;he's a young, idle; indi&s;creet, giddy girl, with half a dozen lovers in her &s;uite; &s;ome coxcombs, &s;ome men of gallantry, &s;ome &s;ingle, and &s;ome married."</P>
<P>Dorriforth &s;tarted.&mdash;"For the fir&s;t time of my life," cried he with a manly &s;orrow, "I wi&s;h I had never known her father."</P>
<P>"Nay," &s;aid Mrs. Horton, who expected every thing to happen ju&s;t as &s;he wi&s;hed, (for neither an excellent education, the be&s;t company, or long ex|perience had been able to cultivate or brighten this good lady's under&s;tanding.) "Nay," &s;aid &s;he, "I am &s;ure, Mr. Dorriforth, you will &s;oon convert her from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> her evil ways."</P>
<P>"Dear me," returned lady Evans, "I am &s;ure I never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to hint at any thing evil&mdash;and for what I have &s;aid, I will give you up my authors if you plea&s;e; for they were not ob&s;ervations of my own&punc; all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> mention them again."</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="025650_0012_0FCEB0F23629E3F8">
The good natured Mi&s;s Woodley, who &s;at work|ing at the window, an humble li&s;tener to this di&s;|cour&s;e, ventured on this to &s;ay exactly &s;ix words: "Then don't mention them any more."</P>
<P>"Let us change the &s;ubject," &s;aid Dorriforth.</P>
<P>"With all my heart," cried her lady&s;hip, "and I am &s;ure it will be to the young lady's advantage."</P>
<P>"Is &s;he tall, or &s;hort?" a&s;ked Mrs. Horton, &s;till wi&s;hing for farther information.</P>
<P>"Oh, tall enough of all con&s;cience," returned lady Evans; "I tell you again there is no fault can be found with her per&s;on."</P>
<P>"But if her mind is defective"&mdash;exclaimed Dor|riforth with a &s;igh&mdash;</P>
<P>"&mdash;That may be improved as well as the per|&s;on," cried Mi&s;s Woodley.</P>
<P>"No my dear," returned her lady&s;hip, "I never heard of a pad to make &s;trait an ill-&s;hapen di&s;po|&s;ition."</P>
<P>"O yes, lady Evans," an&s;wered Mi&s;s Woodley; "good company, good books, experience, and the misfortunes of other's, may have more power to form the mind to virtue, than"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Her lady&s;hip would not &s;uffer her to go on, but ri&s;ing ha&s;tily from her &s;eat, cried, "I mu&s;t be gone&mdash;I have fifty people waiting for me at home&mdash;be&s;ides, were I inclined to hear a &s;ermon, I &s;hould de&s;ire Mr. Dorriforth to preach, and not you."</P>
<P>Ju&s;t then Mrs. Hillgrave was announced.&mdash;"And here is Mrs. Hillgrave,"&mdash;Continued lady Evans&mdash;"I believe Mrs. Hillgrave you know Mi&s;s Milner don't you? The young lady who has lately lo&s;t her father."</P>
<P>Mrs. Hillgrave was the wife of a merchant who had met with &s;ome &s;evere lo&s;&s;es, and as &s;oon as the name of Mi&s;s Milner was uttered, &s;he lifted up her hands, and the tears &s;tarted in her eyes.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="025650_0013_0FCEB0F3B8FE02F8">
"There!" cried lady Evans, "I de&s;ire you will give your opinion of her, and I am &s;orry I cannot &s;tay to hear it." Saying this, &s;he coure<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">d and took her leave.</P>
<P>When Mrs. Hillgrave had been &s;eated a few mi|nutes, Mrs. Horton, who loved information equal to the mo&s;t inqui&s;itive of her &s;ex, begged that lady,&mdash;"if &s;he might be permitted to know, why, at the mention of Mi&s;s Milner, &s;he had &s;eemed &s;o much affected?"</P>
<P>This que&s;tion intere&s;ting the fears of Dorriforth, he turned anxiou&s;ly round attentive to the reply.</P>
<P>"Mi&s;s Milner," an&s;wered &s;he, "has been my benefactre&s;s, and the be&s;t I ever had." As &s;he &s;poke, &s;he took out her handkerchief and wiped away the tears that ran down her face.</P>
<P>"How &s;o?" cried Dorriforth eagerly, with his eyes moi&s;tened with joy, nearly as much as her's were with gratitude.</P>
<P>"My hu&s;band, at the commencement of his di&s;tre&s;&s;es," replied Mrs. Hillgrave, "owed a &s;um of money to her father, and from repeated provoca|tions, Mr. Milner was determined to &s;eize upon all our effects&mdash;his daughter, however, procured us time in order to di&s;charge the debt; and when &s;he found that time was in&s;ufficient, and her father no longer to be di&s;&s;uaded from his intention, &s;he &s;e|cretly &s;old &s;ome of her mo&s;t valuable ornaments to &s;atisfy his demand and &s;creen us from its con&s;equen|ces."</P>
<P>Dorriforth, plea&s;ed at this recital, took Mrs. Hillgrave by the hand, and told her "&s;he &s;hould never want a friend."</P>
<P>"Is Mi&s;s Milner tall, or &s;hort?" again a&s;ked Mrs. Horton, fearing from the &s;udden pau&s;e which had en&s;ued, the &s;ubject &s;hould be dropped.</P>
<P>"I don't know," an&s;wered Mrs. Hillgrave.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="025650_0014_0FCEB0F7CF1EA2D0">
"Is &s;he hand&s;ome, or ugly?"</P>
<P>"I really can't tell."</P>
<P>"It is very &s;trange you &s;hould not take notice!"</P>
<P>"I did take notice, but I cannot depend upon my own judgment&mdash;to me &s;he appeared beautiful as an angel, but perhaps I was deceived by the beau|ties of her di&s;po&s;ition."</P>

<P>THIS gentlewoman's vi&s;it in&s;pired Mr. Dorri|forth with &s;ome confidence in the principles and character of his ward.&mdash;The day arrived on which &s;he was to leave her father's &s;eat, to take up her abode at Mrs. Horton's; and he, accompanied by Mi&s;s Woodley, went in his carriage to meet her, and waited at an inn on the road for her recep|tion.</P>
<P>After many a &s;igh paid to the memory of her father, Mi&s;s Milner, upon the tenth of November, arrived at the place, half way on her journey to town, where Dorriforth and Mi&s;s Woodley were expecting her.&mdash;Be&s;ides attendants, &s;he had with her a gentleman and a lady, di&s;tant relations of her mother's, who thought it but a proper te&s;timony of their civility to attend her part of the way, but who &s;o much envied her guardian the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Mr. Milner had repo&s;ed in him, that as &s;oon as they had delivered her &s;afe into his care, they returned.</P>
<P>When the carriage which brought Mi&s;s.

was even obliged to rouze him from the dejection into which he was ca&s;t, or he would have &s;unk be|neath it&mdash;&s;he was obliged al&s;o to be the fir&s;t to wel|come his lovely charge.&mdash;Lovely beyond de&s;cription.</P>
<P>But the &s;prightly vivacity, the natural gaiety, which report had given to Mi&s;s Milner, were &s;oft|ened by her recent &s;orrow to a meek &s;adne&s;s&mdash;and that haughty di&s;play of charms, imputed to her manners, was changed to a pen&s;ive demeanor.&mdash;The in&s;tant Dorriforth was introduced to her by Mi&s;s Woodley as her "Guardian, and her decea&s;|ed father's mo&s;t beloved friend," &s;he bur&s;t into a flood of tears, knelt down to him for a moment, and promi&s;ed ever to obey him as her father.&mdash;He had his handkerchief to his face at the time, or &s;he would have beheld the agitation of his heart&mdash;the remote&s;t &s;en&s;ations of his &s;oul.</P>
<P>This affecting introduction being over, and &s;ome minutes pa&s;&s;ed in general conver&s;ation, the carri|ages were again ordered, and, bidding farewel to the friends who had accompanied her, Mi&s;s Milner, her guardian, and Mi&s;s Woodley departed for town; the two ladies in Mi&s;s Milner's carriage, and Dorri|forth in that in which he came.</P>

<P>AFTER a night's re&s;t in London, le&s;s &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed with the lo&s;s of her father, reconciled, if not already attached to her new acquaintance, her thoughts plea&s;ingly occupied with the reflection &s;he was in that gay metropolis&mdash;a wild rapturous picture of which her active fancy had often formed&mdash;Mi&s;s Milner aro&s;e from a peaceful and refre&s;hing &s;leep, with much of that vivacity, and all tho&s;e airy charms, which for a while had yielded their tran&s;cendant power, to le&s;s potent &s;adne&s;s.</P>
<P>Beautiful as &s;he had appeared to Mi&s;s Woodley and to Dorriforth the preceding day, when &s;he joined them the next morning at breakfa&s;t, repo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of her lively elegance and dignified &s;implici|ty, they gazed at her, and at each other alternate|ly, with wonder!&mdash;and Mrs. Horton, as &s;he &s;at at the head of her tea-table, felt her&s;elf but as a me|nial &s;ervant, &s;uch command has beauty if united with &s;en&s;e and with virtue.&mdash;In Mi&s;s Milner it was &s;o united.&mdash;Yet let not our over-&s;crupulous readers be mi&s;led, and extend their idea of her virtue &s;o as to magnify it beyond that which frail mortals commonly po&s;&s;e&s;s; nor mu&s;t they cavil, if, on a nearer view, they find it le&s;s&mdash;but let them con&s;ider, that if Mi&s;s Milner had more faults than generally belong to others, &s;he had likewi&s;e more temptations.</P>
<P>From her infancy &s;he had been indulged in all her wi&s;hes to the extreme of folly, and habitually &s;tarted at the unplea&s;ant voice of controul&mdash;&s;he was beautiful, &s;he had been too frequently told the high value of that beauty, and thought tho&s;e moments

pa&s;&s;ed in wa&s;teful idlene&s;s during which &s;he was not gaining &s;ome new conque&s;t&mdash;&s;he had be&s;ides a quick &s;en&s;ibility, which too frequently di&s;covered it&s;elf in the immediate re&s;entment of injury or ne|glect&mdash;&s;he had acquired al&s;o the dangerous charac|ter of a wit; but to which &s;he had no real preten|&s;ions, although the mo&s;t di&s;cerning critic, hearing her conver&s;e, might fall into this mi&s;take.&mdash;Her re|plies had all the effect of repartee, not becau&s;e &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed tho&s;e qualities which can properly be call|ed wit, but that what &s;he &s;aid was &s;poken with an energy, an in&s;tantaneous and powerful perception of what &s;he &s;aid, joined with a real or well-coun|terfeited &s;implicity, a quick turn of the eye, and an arch &s;mile of the countenance.&mdash;Her words were but the words of others, and, like tho&s;e of others, put into common &s;entences; but the deli|very made them pa&s;s for wit, as grace, in an ill proportioned figure, will often make it pa&s;s for &s;ymmetry.</P>
<P>And now&mdash;leaving de&s;cription&mdash;the reader mu&s;t form a judgment of her by her actions; by all the round of great or trivial circum&s;tances that &s;hall be related.</P>
<P>At breakfa&s;t, which was ju&s;t begun at the begin|ning of this chapter, the conver&s;ation was lively on the part of Mi&s;s Milner, wi&s;e on the part of Dorriforth, good on the part of Mi&s;s Woodley, and an endeavour at all three on the part of Mrs. Horton.&mdash;The di&s;cour&s;e at length drew from Mr. Dorriforth this ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>"You have a greater re&s;emblance of your fa|ther, Mi&s;s Milner, than I imagined you had from report: I did not expect to find you &s;o like him."</P>
<P>"Nor did I, Mr. Dorriforth, expect to find you any thing like what you are."</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="025650_0018_0FCEB0FF5F74CF88">
"No?&mdash;pray, madam, what did you expect to find me?"</P>
<P>"I expected to find you an elderly man, and a plain man."</P>
<P>This was &s;poken in an artle&s;s manner, but in a tone which obviou&s;ly declared &s;he thought her guardian both young and hand&s;ome.&mdash;He replied, but not without &s;ome little embarra&s;&s;ment, "A plain man you &s;hall find me in all my actions."</P>
<P>She returned, "Then your actions are to con|tradict your looks."</P>
<P>For in what &s;he &s;aid, Mi&s;s Milner had the quality peculiar to wits, to &s;peak the thought that fir&s;t occurs, which thought has generally truth on its &s;ide.&mdash;On this he ventured to pay her a compliment in return.</P>
<P>"You, Mi&s;s Milner, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, mu&s;t be a very bad judge of what is plain, and what is not."</P>
<P>"How &s;o, Sir?"</P>
<P>"Becau&s;e I am &s;ure you will readily own you do not think your&s;elf hand&s;ome; and allowing that, you in&s;tantly want judgment."</P>
<P>"And I would rather want judgment than beau|ty," &s;he replied; "and &s;o I give up the one for the other."</P>
<P>With a &s;erious face, as if propo&s;ing a mo&s;t &s;e|rious que&s;tion, Dorriforth continued, "And you really believe you are not hand&s;ome?"</P>
<P>"I &s;hould from my own opinion believe &s;o, but in &s;ome re&s;pects I am like you, Roman Catholics; I don't believe from my own under&s;tanding, but from what other people tell me."</P>
<P>"And let this be the criterion," replied Dorri|forth, "that what we teach is truth; for you find you would be deceived did you not tru&s;t to per&s;ons who know better than your&s;elf.&mdash;But, my dear Mi&s;s Milner, we will talk upon &s;ome other topic, and
<PB N="16" REF="025650_0019_0FCEB10089700400">
never re&s;ume this again&mdash;we differ in opinion, I dare &s;ay, on one &s;ubject only, and this difference I hope will never extend it&s;elf to any other.&mdash;There|fore, let not religion be named between us; for as I have re&s;olved never to per&s;ecute you, in pity be grateful, and do not per&s;ecute me."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner looked with &s;upri&s;e that any thing &s;o lightly &s;aid, &s;hould be &s;o &s;eriou&s;ly received.&mdash;The kind Mi&s;s Woodley ejaculated a &s;hort prayer to her&s;elf, that heaven would forgive her young friend the involuntary &s;in of ignorance&mdash;while Mrs. Horton, unperceived as &s;he imagined, made the &s;ign of the cro&s;s upon her forehead to prevent the infectious taint of Heretical opinions. This pious ceremony Mi&s;s Milner, by chance, ob&s;erved, and now &s;howed &s;uch an evident propen&s;ity to bur&s;t into a &s;it of laughter, that the good lady of the hou&s;e could no longer contain her re&s;entment, but exclaimed, "God forgive you." With a &s;everity &s;o far different from the idea the words conveyed, that the object of her anger was, on this, obliged freely to indulge that ri&s;ibilty which &s;he had been &s;truggling to &s;mo|ther; and without longer &s;uffering under the agony of re&s;traint, &s;he gave way to her humour, and laughed with a liberty &s;o uncontrouled, that in a &s;hort time le&s;t her in the room with none but the tender-hearted Mi&s;s Woodley a witne&s;s of her folly.</P>
<P>"My dear Mi&s;s Woodley," (then cried Mi&s;s Mil|ner, after recovering her&s;elf,) "I am afraid you will not forgive me."</P>
<P>"No, indeed I will not" returned Mi&s;s Wood|ley.</P>
<P>But how unimportant, how weak, how ineffec|tual are <HI>words</HI> in conver&s;ation&mdash;looks and manners alone expre&s;s&mdash;for Mi&s;s Woodley, with her cha|ritable face and mild accents, &s;aying &s;he would not forgive, implied only forgivene&s;s&mdash;while Mrs. Hor|ton,

<P>SIX weeks have now elap&s;ed &s;ince Mi&s;s Milner has been in London, partaking with delight in all its plea&s;ures, whil&s;t Dorriforth has been &s;ighing with apprehen&s;ions, attending with precaution, and praying with the mo&s;t zealous fervour for her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">afe|ty.&mdash;Her own and her guardian's acquaintance, and the new friend&s;hips (to &s;peak in the unmeaning language of the world) which &s;he was continually forming, crowded &s;o perpetually to the hou&s;e, that &s;eldom had Dorriforth even a moment left from her vi&s;its or vi&s;itors, to warn her of her danger&mdash;yet when a moment offered, he &s;natched it eagerly&mdash;pre&s;&s;ed the nece&s;&s;ity of "time not always pa&s;&s;ed in &s;ociety; of reflection; of reading: of thoughts for a future &s;tate; and of virtues acquired to make old age &s;upportable."&mdash;That forcible power of innate feeling, which directs the tongue to eloquence, had its effect while &s;he li&s;tened to him, and &s;he &s;ome|times put on the looks and ge&s;ture of a&s;&s;ent, and &s;ometimes even &s;poke the language of conviction; but this, the fir&s;t call of di&s;&s;ipation would change to ill-timed raillery, or peevi&s;h remon&s;trance, at being limited in delights her birth and fortune en|titled her to enjoy.</P>
<P>Among the many vi&s;itors who attended at her levees, and followed wherever &s;he went, was one
<PB N="18" REF="025650_0021_0FCEB10374676BA8">
that &s;eemed, even when ab&s;ent, to &s;hare her thoughts.&mdash;This was Lord Frederick Lawnly, the &s;on of a duke, and the avowed favourite of all the mo&s;t di&s;cerning women of ta&s;te.</P>
<P>Lord Frederick was not more than twenty-three; &s;prightly, elegant, extremely hand&s;ome, and po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of every accompli&s;hment to captivate a heart le&s;s &s;u&s;ceptible of love than Mi&s;s Milner's was &s;up|po&s;ed to be.&mdash;With the&s;e allurements, no wonder if &s;he took a plea&s;ure in his company&mdash;no wonder if &s;he took a pride to have it known he was among the number of her mo&s;t devoted admirers.&mdash;Dor|riforth beheld the growing intimacy with alternate pain and plea&s;ure&mdash;he wi&s;hed to &s;ee Mi&s;s Milner married, to &s;ee his charge in the protection of ano|ther, rather than of him&s;elf: yet under the care of a young nobleman, immer&s;ed in all the vices of the town, without one moral excellence, but &s;uch as might re&s;ult eventually from the influence of the moment&mdash;under &s;uch care he trembled for her hap|pine&s;s&mdash;yet trembled more le&s;t her heart &s;hould be purloined, without even the authority of matrimo|nial views.</P>
<P>With the&s;e &s;entiments Dorriforth could never di&s;gui&s;e his unea&s;ine&s;s at the &s;ight of Lord Frede|rick, nor could his lord&s;hip but di&s;cern the &s;u&s;pi|cion of the guardian, and con&s;equently each was embarra&s;&s;ed in the pre&s;ence of the other.&mdash;Mi&s;s Milner ob&s;erved, but ob&s;erved with indifference, the &s;en&s;ations of both&mdash;there was but one pa&s;&s;ion which at pre&s;ent held a place in her heart, and that was vanity; vanity defined into all the &s;pecies of pride, vain-glory, &s;elf-approbation&mdash;an inordi|nate de&s;ire of admiration, and on immoderate en|joyment of the art of plea&s;ing, for her own indivi|dual happine&s;s, and not for the happine&s;s of others&mdash;Still had &s;he a heart inclined, and oftentimes af|fected,
<PB N="19" REF="025650_0022_0FCEB108ABE27F40">
by tendencies le&s;s unworthy; but tho&s;e ap|proaches to what was e&s;timable, were generally ar|re&s;ted in their fir&s;t impul&s;e by &s;ome darling folly.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley (who could di&s;cover virtue, al|though of the mo&s;t diminu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ive kind, and &s;carcely through the magnifying gla&s;s of calumny could ever perceive a fault) was Mi&s;s Milner's con&s;tant compa|nion, and her advocate with Dorriforth, whenever, during her ab&s;ence, &s;he became the &s;ubject of di&s;|cour&s;e&mdash;he li&s;tened with hope to the prai&s;es of her friend, but &s;aw with de&s;pair how little they were merited.&mdash;Sometimes he &s;truggled to contain his anger, but oftener &s;trove to &s;uppre&s;s tears of pity for her haple&s;s &s;tate.</P>
<P>By this time all her acquaintance had given Lord Frederick to her as a lover, the &s;ervants whi&s;pered it, and &s;ome of the public prints had even fixed the day of marriage;&mdash;but as no explanation had taken place on the part of his lord&s;hip, Dorriforth's unea&s;ine&s;s was encrea&s;ed, and he &s;eriou&s;ly told his Ward he thought it prudent to entreat Lord Frede|rich to de&s;i&s;t-vi&s;iting her.&mdash;She &s;miled with ridicule at the caution, but finding it a &s;econd time repeat|ed, and in a manner that &s;avoured of authority, &s;he promi&s;ed to make, and to enforce, the reque&s;t.&mdash;The next time his lord&s;hip came &s;he did &s;o, a&s;|&s;uring him it was by her guardian's de&s;ire; "who from motives of delicacy had permitted her rather to &s;olicit as a favour, what he him&s;elf would make as a demand."&mdash;Lord Frederick reddened with anger&mdash;he loved Mi&s;s Milner, but he doubted whether from the frequent proofs he had experienced of (his own incon&s;tancy) he &s;hould continue to love&mdash;and this interference of her guardian threatened an explanation or a di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, before he became thoroughly acquainted with his own heart.&mdash;Alarm|ed, confounded, and provoked, he replied,</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="025650_0023_0FCEB10984943DC0">
"By heaven, I believe Mr. Dorriforth loves you him&s;elf, and it is jealou&s;y makes him treat me thus."</P>
<P>"For &s;hame, my lord!" cried Mi&s;s Woodley, who was pre&s;ent, and trembling with horror at the &s;acrilegious idea.</P>
<P>"Nay, &s;hame for him if he be not in love,"&mdash;an&s;wered his lord&s;hip; "for what but a &s;avage could behold beauty like her's, and not own its power?"</P>
<P>"Habit," replied Mi&s;s Milner, "is every thing&mdash;and Mr. Dorriforth &s;ees and conver&s;es with beauty, and from habit does not fall in love, as you, my lord, merely from habit do."</P>
<P>"Then you believe," cried he, "love is not in my nature?"</P>
<P>"No more of it, my lord, than habit could very &s;oon extingui&s;h."</P>
<P>"But I would not have it extingui&s;hed&mdash;I would rather it &s;hould mount to a flame, for I think it a crime to be in&s;en&s;ible of the ble&s;&s;ings love can be|&s;tow."</P>
<P>"Then your lord&s;hip indulges the pa&s;&s;ion to avoid a &s;in?&mdash;the very motive which deters Mr. Dorriforth."</P>
<P>"Which ought to deter him, madam, for the &s;ake of his oaths&mdash;but mona&s;tic vows, like tho&s;e of marriage, were made to be broken&mdash;and &s;urely when your guardian looks on you, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> wi&s;hes"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Are never le&s;s pure," returned Mi&s;s Milner eagerly, "than tho&s;e which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> the bo&s;om of my cele&s;tial guardian."</P>
<P>At that in&s;tant Dorriforth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ntered the room. The colour had mounted into Mi&s;s Milner's face from the warmth with which &s;he had delivered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> opinion, and his entering at the very moment this compliment had been paid in his ab&s;ence, height|ened the blu&s;h to a deep gl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">w on every feature, and

a confu&s;ion that trembled on her lips and &s;hook through all her frame.</P>
<P>"What's the matter?" cried Dorriforth, look|ing with concern on her di&s;compo&s;ure.</P>
<P>"A compliment paid by her&s;elf to you, Sir," replied his lord&s;hip, "has thus affected the lady."</P>
<P>"As if &s;he blu&s;hed at the untruth," &s;aid Dor|riforth.</P>
<P>"Nay, that is unkind," cried Mi&s;s Woodley, "for if you had been here"&mdash;</P>
<P>"&mdash;I would not have &s;aid what I did," replied Mi&s;s Milner, "but le&s;t him to vindicate him&s;elf."</P>
<P>"Is it po&s;&s;ible I can want vindication?" return|ed Dorriforth, "Who would think it worth their while to &s;lander &s;o unimportant a per&s;on as I am?"</P>
<P>"The man who has the charge of Mi&s;s Milner," replied Lord Frederick, "derives a con&s;equence from her."</P>
<P>"No ill con&s;equence, I hope, my lord?" replied Dorriforth with a firmne&s;s in his voice, and an eye fixed &s;o &s;tedfa&s;tly, that his lord&s;hip he&s;itated for a a moment in want of a reply&mdash;and Mi&s;s Milner &s;oftly whi&s;pering to him, as her guardian turned his head, to avoid an argument, he bowed acqui|e&s;cence.&mdash;And then, as in compliment to her, he wi&s;hed to change the &s;ubject, with a &s;mile of ridi|cule he cried,</P>
<P>"I wi&s;h, Mr. Dorriforth, you would give me ab&s;olution of all my &s;ins, for I confe&s;s they are many and manifold."</P>
<P>"Hold, my lord," exclaimed Dorriforth, "do not confe&s;s before the ladies, le&s;t in order to excite their compa&s;&s;ion, you &s;hould be tempted to accu&s;e your&s;elf of &s;ins you have never yet committed."</P>
<P>At this Mi&s;s Milner laughed, &s;eemingly &s;o well plea&s;ed, that Lord Frederick with a &s;arca&s;tic &s;neer, repeated,

<L>From Abelard it came,</L>
<L>And Heloi&s;a &s;till mu&s;t love the name.</L></Q>
Whether from an inattention to the quotation, or from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s it was wholly inapplicable, Dor|riforth heard it without one emotion of &s;hame or of anger&mdash;while Mi&s;s Milner &s;eemed &s;hocked at the implication; her plea&s;antry was immediately depre&s;&s;ed, and &s;he threw open the &s;a&s;h and held her head out at the window, to conceal the embar|ra&s;&s;ment the&s;e lines had occa&s;ioned.</P>
<P>The Earl of Elmwood was at this juncture an|nounced&mdash;a Catholic nobleman, ju&s;t come of age, and on the eve of marriage&mdash;his lord&s;hip's vi&s;it was to his cou&s;in, Mr. Dorriforth, but as all ceremo|nious vi&s;its were alike received by Dorriforth, Mi&s;s Milner, and Mrs. Horton's family in one common apartment, Lord Elmwood was u&s;hered into this, and for the pre&s;ent directed the conver&s;ation to a different &s;ubject.</P>

<P>IN anxious de&s;ire that the affection, or acquaint|ance, between Lord Frederick Lawnly and Mi&s;s Milner might be finally broken, her guardian re|ceived with the highe&s;t &s;atisfaction, overtures from Sir Edward A&s;hton, in behalf of his pa&s;&s;ion for that young lady.&mdash;Sir Edward was not young or hand&s;ome; old or ugly; but immen&s;ely rich, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of qualities that made him, in every &s;en&s;e, worthy the happine&s;s to which he a&s;pired.&mdash;He was the man Dorriforth would have cho&s;en before any other for the hu&s;band of his Ward, and his wi&s;hes made him &s;ometimes hope, again&s;t his rea|&s;on,
<PB N="23" REF="025650_0026_0FCEB111087DC078">
&s;on, that Sir Edward would not be rejected&mdash;and he re&s;olved to try the force of his own power in the &s;tronge&s;t recommendation of him.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding that di&s;&s;imilarity of opinion, which in almo&s;t every re&s;pect, &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between Mi&s;s Milner and her guardian, there was generally the mo&s;t punctilious ob&s;ervance of good manners from each towards the other&mdash;on the part of Dor|riforth more e&s;pecially; for his politene&s;s would &s;ometimes appear even like the re&s;ult of a &s;y&s;tem he had marked out for him&s;elf, as the only means to keep his Ward re&s;trained within the &s;ame limi|tations.&mdash;Whenever he addre&s;&s;ed her there was unu&s;ual re&s;erve upon his countenance, and more than u&s;ual gentlene&s;s in his tone of voice; which &s;eemed the effect of &s;entiments her birth and &s;itua|tion in&s;pired, joined to a &s;tudied mode of re&s;pect be&s;t &s;uited to enforce the &s;ame from her.&mdash;The wi&s;hed for con&s;equence was produced&mdash;for though there was an in&s;tinctive rectitude in the under&s;tand|ing of Mi&s;s Milner that would have taught her, without other in&s;truction, what manners to ob&s;erve towards her deputed father; yet from &s;ome volatile thought, or &s;ome quick &s;en&s;e of feeling, &s;he had not been accu&s;tomed to &s;ubdue, &s;he was perpetually on the verge of treating him with levity; but he would immediately recall her recollection by a re&s;erve too awful, and a gentlene&s;s too &s;acred for her to vio|late. The di&s;tinction which both required, was thus, by his &s;kilful management alone, pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>One morning he took an opportunity, before her and Mi&s;s Woodley, to introduce and pre&s;s the &s;ubject of Sir Edward A&s;hton's hopes. He fir&s;t &s;poke warmly in his prai&s;e, then plainly told Mi&s;s Milner he believed &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the power to make &s;o de&s;erving a man happy to the &s;ummit of his wi&s;hes. A laugh of ridicule was the only an|&s;wer,&mdash;but a &s;udden and expre&s;&s;ive frown from
<PB N="24" REF="025650_0027_0FCEB11277A4DB98">
Dorriforth having quickly put an end to it, he re|&s;umed his wonted politene&s;s, and &s;aid,</P>
<P>"I wi&s;h, Mi&s;s Milner, you would &s;how more good ta&s;te than thus pointedly to di&s;approve of Sir Edward."</P>
<P>"How, Mr. Dorriforth," replied &s;he, "can you expect me to give proofs of a good ta&s;te, when Sir Edward, whom you con&s;ider with &s;uch high e&s;teem, has given &s;o bad an example of his, in approving of me?"</P>
<P>Dorriforth wi&s;hed not to flatter her frailty by a compliment &s;he &s;eemed to have &s;ought for, and for a moment he&s;itated what to &s;ay.</P>
<P>"An&s;wer, Sir, that que&s;tion," &s;he cried.</P>
<P>"Why then, madam," replied he, "it is my opinion, that &s;uppo&s;ing what your humility has ad|vanced to be ju&s;t, yet Sir Edward will not &s;uffer by the &s;ugge&s;tion: for in ca&s;es where the heart is &s;o immediately concerned, as I believe Sir Edward's to be, good ta&s;te, or rather rea&s;on, has not proper power to act."</P>
<P>"You are right, Mr. Dorriforth: this is a tho|rough ju&s;tification of Sir Edward&mdash;and when I fall in love, I mu&s;t beg you will make the &s;ame excu&s;e for me."</P>
<P>"Then," returned he earne&s;tly, "before your heart is in that &s;tate I have de&s;cribed, exert your rea&s;on."</P>
<P>"I &s;hall," an&s;wered &s;he, "and not con&s;ent to marry a man whom I could never love."</P>
<P>"Unle&s;s your heart is already given away, Mi&s;s Milner, what can make you &s;peak with &s;uch a de|gree of certainty?"</P>
<P>He thought on Lord Frederick while <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;aid this, and he fixed his eyes upon her as if he wi&s;hed to penetrate her &s;entiments, and yet trembled for what he might find there;&mdash;&s;he blu&s;hed, and her

looks would have confirmed her guilty, had not a free and unembarra&s;&s;ed tone of voice, more than her words, pre&s;erved her from that &s;entence.</P>
<P>"No," &s;he replied, "my heart is not given away, and yet I can venture to declare Sir Edward will never po&s;&s;e&s;s an atom of it."</P>
<P>"I am &s;orry for both your &s;akes, the&s;e are your &s;entiments," he replied; "but as your heart is &s;till your own," (and he &s;eemed rejoiced to find it was) "permit me to warn you how you part with a thing &s;o precious&mdash;the dangers, the &s;orrows you hazard in be&s;towing it, are greater than you may be aware of. The heart once gone, our thoughts, our actions, are no more our own, than that is."&mdash;He &s;eemed <HI>forcing</HI> him&s;elf to utter all this, and yet to break off as if he could have &s;aid much more, had not the extreme delicacy of the &s;ubject prevent|ed him.</P>
<P>When he left the room, and Mi&s;s Milner heard the door &s;hut after him, &s;he &s;aid with a thoughtful and inqui&s;itive earne&s;tne&s;s, "What can make good people &s;o &s;killed in all the weakne&s;&s;es of the bad? Mr. Dorriforth with all tho&s;e prudent admonitions, appears rather like a man who has pa&s;&s;ed his life in the gay world, experienced all its dangerous allure|ments, all its repentant &s;orrows, than like one who had lived his whole time &s;ecluded in a mona&s;tery or his own &s;tudy.&mdash;Then he &s;peaks with &s;uch exqui|&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility on the &s;ubject of love, he commend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the very thing he would decry.&mdash;I do not think my Lord Frederick could make the pa&s;&s;ion appear in more plea&s;ing colours by painting its delights, than Mr. Dorriforth can in de&s;cribing its &s;orrows&mdash;and if he talks to me frequently in this manner, I &s;hall certainly take pity on his lord&s;hip, for the &s;ake of his enemy's eloquence."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley, who heard the conclu&s;ion of this
<PB N="26" REF="025650_0029_0FCEB117C45B2C60">
&s;peech with the tendere&s;t concern, cried, "Alas! you then think &s;eriou&s;ly of Lord Frederick!"</P>
<P>"Suppo&s;e I do, wherefore that <HI>alas!</HI> Mi&s;s Wood|ley?"</P>
<P>"Becau&s;e I fear you will never be happy with him."</P>
<P>"That is plainly telling me he will not be happy with me."</P>
<P>"I cannot &s;peak of marriage from experience," an&s;wered Mi&s;s Woodley, "but I think I can gue&s;s what it is.</P>
<P>"Nor can I &s;peak of love from experience," re|plied Mi&s;s Milner, "but I think I can gue&s;s what it is."</P>
<P>"But do not fall in love, my dear Mi&s;s Milner," (cried Mi&s;s Woodley, with an earne&s;tne&s;s as if &s;he had been a&s;king a favour that depended upon the will of the per&s;on entreated,) "do not fall in love without the approbation of your guardian."</P>

<P>SIR EDWARD, not wholly di&s;couraged by the de|nial with which Dorriforth had, with delicacy, ac|quainted him, &s;till hoped for a kinder reception, and was &s;o frequently in the hou&s;e of Mrs. Horton, that Lord Frederick's jealou&s;y was excited, and the tortures he &s;uffered in con&s;equence, convinced him beyond a doubt of the &s;incerity of his affection. He now, every time he beheld the object of his
<PB N="27" REF="025650_0030_0FCEB1199B68F7C0">
pa&s;&s;ion, (for he &s;till continued his vi&s;its, tho' le&s;s frequently than before) pleaded his cau&s;e &s;o ardent|ly, that Mi&s;s Woodley, who was occa&s;ionally pre|&s;ent, and ever compa&s;&s;ionate, could &s;carce re&s;i&s;t wi&s;hing him &s;ucce&s;s. He now unequivocally offered marriage, and entreated to be &s;uffered to lay his propo&s;als before Mr. Dorriforth, but this Mi&s;s Mil|ner po&s;itively forbid.</P>
<P>Her reluctance he imputed, however, more to the known partiality of her guardian to the addre&s;|&s;es of Sir Edward, than to any motive which de|pended upon her&s;elf; and to Mr. Dorriforth his lord&s;hip conceived a greater di&s;like than ever; be|lieving that through his interpo&s;ition, in &s;pite of his ward's attachment, he might yet be deprived of her&mdash;but Mi&s;s Milner declared both to him and to her friend, Love had, at pre&s;ent, gained no one influence over her mind&mdash;Yet did the watchful Mi&s;s Woodley oftentimes hear a &s;igh bur&s;t forth, unknowing to her&s;elf, till &s;he was reminded of it, and then a &s;udden blu&s;h of &s;hame would in&s;tantly &s;pread over her face.&mdash;This &s;eeming &s;truggle with her pa&s;&s;ion, endeared her more than ever to Mi&s;s Woodley, and &s;he would even ri&s;k the di&s;plea&s;ure of Dorriforth by her ready compliance in every new pur&s;uit that might amu&s;e the time, &s;he el&s;e &s;aw pa&s;&s;|ed by her friend in heavine&s;s of heart.</P>
<P>Balls, plays, ince&s;&s;ant company, at length rou&s;ed her guardian from that mildne&s;s with which he had been accu&s;tomed to treat her&mdash;night after night his &s;leep had been di&s;turbed by fears for her &s;afety while abroad; morning after morning it had been broken by the clamour of her return.&mdash;He therefore &s;aid to her one forenoon, as he met her accidentally upon the &s;tair ca&s;e,</P>
<P>"I hope, Mi&s;s Milner, you pa&s;s this evening at home?"</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="025650_0031_0FCEB11D08461A60">
Unprepared for the &s;udden que&s;tion, &s;he blu&s;h|ed and replied, "Yes;" while &s;he knew &s;he was engaged to a brilliant a&s;&s;embly, for which &s;he had been a whole week con&s;ulting her milliner in pre|paration.</P>
<P>She, however, flattered her&s;elf what &s;he had &s;aid to Mr. Dorriforth might be excu&s;ed as a &s;light mi&s;|take, the lap&s;e of memory, or &s;ome other trifling fault, when he &s;hould know the truth&mdash;the truth was earlier divulged than &s;he expected&mdash;for ju&s;t as dinner was removed, her footman delivered a me&s;|&s;age to her from her milliner concerning a new dre&s;s for the evening&mdash;the pre&s;ent evening particu|larly marked.&mdash;Dorriforth looked a&s;toni&s;hed.</P>
<P>"I thought, Mi&s;s Milner, you gave me your word you would pa&s;s this evening at home?"</P>
<P>"I mi&s;took then&mdash;for I had before given my word I &s;hould pa&s;s it abroad."</P>
<P>"Indeed!" cried he.</P>
<P>"Yes, indeed," returned &s;he; "and I believe it is right I &s;hould keep my fir&s;t promi&s;e; is it not?"</P>
<P>"The promi&s;e you gave me then, you do not think of any con&s;equence."</P>
<P>"Yes, certainly; if you do."</P>
<P>"I do."</P>
<P>"And mean, perhaps, to make it of much more con&s;equence than it de&s;erves, by being offend|ed."</P>
<P>"Whether or not, I am offended&mdash;you &s;hall find I am." And he looked &s;o.</P>
<P>She caught his piercing, &s;tedfa&s;t eye&mdash;her's were immediately ca&s;t down; and &s;he trembled&mdash;either with &s;hame or with re&s;entment.</P>
<P>Mrs. Horton ro&s;e from her &s;eat&mdash;moved the de|canters and the fruit round the table&mdash;&s;tirred the fire&mdash;and came back to her &s;eat again, before ano|ther word was uttered.&mdash;Nor had this good woman's
<PB N="29" REF="025650_0032_0FCEB11EE1E0F940">
officious labours taken the lea&s;t from the awkward|ne&s;s of the &s;ilence, which as &s;oon as the bu&s;tle &s;he had made was over, returned in its full force.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, Mi&s;s Milner, ri&s;ing with alacrity, was preparing to go out of the room, when Dorriforth rai&s;ed his voice, and in a tone of authority &s;aid,</P>
<P>"Mi&s;s Milner, you &s;hall not leave the hou&s;e this evening."</P>
<P>"Sir?"&mdash;&s;he exclaimed with a kind of doubt of what &s;he had heard&mdash;a &s;urpri&s;e, which fixed her hand on the door &s;he had half opened, but which now &s;he &s;howed her&s;elf irre&s;olute whether to open wide in defiance, or to &s;hut &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive.&mdash;Before &s;he could re&s;olve, Dorriforth aro&s;e from his &s;eat, and &s;aid with a degree of force and warmth &s;he had never heard him &s;peak with before,</P>
<P>"I command you to &s;tay at home this evening."</P>
<P>And he walked immediately out of the apart|ment by the oppo&s;ite door.&mdash;Her hand fell motion|le&s;s from that &s;he held&mdash;&s;he appeared motionle&s;s her|&s;elf for &s;ome time;&mdash;till Mrs. Horton, "be&s;eech|ing her not to be unea&s;y at the treatment &s;he had received," cau&s;ed a flood of tears to flow, and her bo&s;om to heave as if her heart was breaking.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley would have &s;aid &s;omething to comfort her, but &s;he had caught the infection and could not utter a word&mdash;not from any real cau&s;e of grief did this lady weep; but there was a mag|netic quality in tears, which always drew forth her's.</P>
<P>Mrs. Horton &s;ecretly enjoyed this &s;cene, although the real well meaning of her heart, and ea&s;e of her con&s;cience, did not tell her &s;o&mdash;&s;he, however, de|clared &s;he had long progno&s;ticated it would come to this;" and &s;he "now only thanked heaven it was no wor&s;e."</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="025650_0033_0FCEB120007BDB08">
"What would you have wor&s;e, madam?" cried Mi&s;s Milner, "am not I di&s;appointed of the ball?"</P>
<P>"You don't mean to go then?" &s;aid Mrs. Hor|ton; "I commend your prudence; and I dare &s;ay it is more than your guardian gives you credit for."</P>
<P>"Do you think I would go," an&s;wered Mi&s;s Mil|ner, with an earne&s;tne&s;s that for a time &s;uppre&s;&s;ed her tears, "in contradiction to his will?"</P>
<P>"It is not the fir&s;t time, I believe you have acted contrary to that, Mi&s;s Milner," returned Mrs. Horton, and affected a tenderne&s;s of voice, to &s;oft|en the har&s;hne&s;s of her words.</P>
<P>"If that is the ca&s;e, madam," replied Mi&s;s Mil|ner, "I &s;ee nothing that &s;hould prevent me now." And &s;he flung out of the room as if &s;he had re|&s;olved to di&s;obey him.&mdash;This alarmed poor Mi&s;s Woodley.</P>
<P>"Dear Aunt," &s;he cried to Mrs. Horton, "fol|low and prevail upon Mi&s;s Milner to give up her de&s;ign; &s;he means to go to the ball in oppo&s;ition to her guardian's will."</P>
<P>"Then," cried Mrs. Horton, "I'll not be an in&s;trument in deterring her&mdash;if &s;he does, it may be for the be&s;t; it may give Mr. Dorriforth a clearer knowledge what means are proper to u&s;e, to con|vert her from evil."</P>
<P>"But, dear madam, &s;he mu&s;t be prevented the evil of di&s;obedience; and as you tempted, you will be the mo&s;t likely to di&s;&s;uade her&mdash;but if you will not, I mu&s;t endeavour."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley was leaving the room to perform this good de&s;ign, when Mrs. Horton, in humble imitation of the example given by Dorriforth, cried,</P>
<P>"Niece, I command you not to &s;tir out of this room this evening."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley obediently &s;at down&mdash;and though her thoughts and heart were in the chamber with
<PB N="31" REF="025650_0034_0FCEB122E2F67850">
her friend, &s;he never &s;howed by one impertinent word, or by one line of her face, the re&s;traint &s;he &s;uffered.</P>
<P>At the u&s;ual hour, Mr. Dorriforth and his ward were &s;ummoned to tea:&mdash;Dorriforth entered with a countenance which evinced the remains of anger; his eye gave te&s;timony of his ab&s;ent thoughts; and although he took up a pamphlet and affected to read, it was plain to di&s;cern he &s;carcely knew he held it in his hand.</P>
<P>Mrs. Horton began to make tea with a mind as wholly intent upon &s;omething el&s;e, as Dorriforth's&mdash;&s;he was longing for the event of this mi&s;under|&s;tanding, (for to age trivial matters are important,) and though &s;he wi&s;hed no ill to Mi&s;s Milner, yet with an inclination bent upon &s;eeing &s;omething new&mdash;without the fatigue of going out of her own hou&s;e&mdash;&s;he was not over &s;crupulous what that no|velty might be.&mdash;But for fear &s;he &s;hould have the imprudence to &s;peak a word upon the &s;ubject which employed her thoughts, or even look as if &s;he thought of it at all; &s;he pinched her lips clo&s;e to|gether, and ca&s;t her eyes on vacancy, le&s;t their &s;ig|nificant regards might detect her.&mdash;And for fear any noi&s;e &s;hould intercept even the &s;ound of what might happen, &s;he walked acro&s;s the room more &s;oftly than u&s;ual, and more &s;oftly touched every thing &s;he was obliged to lay her hand on.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley thought it her duty to be mute, and now the gingle of a tea-&s;poon, was like a deep-toned bell, all was &s;o quiet.</P>
<P>Mrs. Horton too, in the &s;elf-approving reflection that &s;he her&s;elf was not in any quarrel, or alterca|tion of any kind, felt at this moment remarkably peaceful, and charitable.&mdash;Mi&s;s Woodley did not recollect <HI>her&s;elf</HI> &s;o, but was &s;o in reality&mdash;in her
<PB N="32" REF="025650_0035_0FCEB1248F0BAF40">
peace and charity were in&s;tinctive virtues, accident could not increa&s;e them.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t cups of tea were &s;carcely poured out, when a &s;ervant came with Mi&s;s Milner's compli|ments and &s;he &s;hould drink none.&mdash;The book &s;hook in Dorriforth's hand while this me&s;&s;age was delivered&mdash;he believed her to be dre&s;&s;ing for her evening's entertainment, and now &s;tudied in what manner to prevent, or to re&s;ent it.&mdash;He coughed&mdash;drank his tea&mdash;endeavoured to talk, but found it difficult&mdash;&s;ometimes read&mdash;and in this manner near two hours were pa&s;&s;ed away, when Mi&s;s Mil|ner came into the room.&mdash;Not dre&s;t for the ball, but as &s;he ro&s;e from dinner.&mdash;Dorriforth read on, and &s;eemed afraid to look up, le&s;t he &s;hould behold what he could not have pardoned.&mdash;She drew a chair and &s;at down at the table by the &s;ide of Mi&s;s Woodley.</P>
<P>After a few minutes pau&s;e, and &s;ome &s;mall em|barra&s;&s;ment on the part of Mrs. Horton, at the di&s;|appointment &s;he had to contend with from Mi&s;s Milner's unexpected obedience, &s;he a&s;ked that young lady "if &s;he would now take tea?"&mdash;to which Mi&s;s Milner replied, "No, I thank you, ma'am," in a voice &s;o languid, compared to her u&s;ual one, that Dorriforth lifted his eyes from the book; and &s;eeing her in the &s;ame negligent dre&s;s &s;he had worn all the day, ca&s;t them away again&mdash;not with a look of triumph, but of confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>And whatever he might have &s;uffered had he be|held her decorated, and on the point of bidding defiance to his commands, yet even upon that trial, he had not endured half the painful &s;en&s;ations he now for a moment felt&mdash;he felt him&s;elf to blame.</P>
<P>He feared he had treated her with too much &s;e|verity&mdash;he admired her conde&s;cen&s;ion, accu&s;ed
<PB N="33" REF="025650_0036_0FCE9EFC1D9D67D8">
him&s;elf for exacting it&mdash;he longed to a&s;k her par|don, he did not know how.</P>
<P>A cheerful reply from her, to a que&s;tion of Mi&s;s Woodley's, embarra&s;&s;ed him &s;till more&mdash;he wi&s;hed &s;he had been &s;ullen, he then would have had a temptation, or a pretence, to have been &s;o too.</P>
<P>With all the&s;e thoughts crowding fa&s;t on his mind he &s;till read, or &s;eemed to read, and to take no notice of what was pa&s;&s;ing; till a &s;ervant en|tered and a&s;ked Mi&s;s Milner what time &s;he would want the chariot? to which &s;he replied, "I don't go out to night."&mdash;He then laid the book out of his hand, and by the time the &s;ervant had left the room, thus began:&mdash;</P>
<P>"Mi&s;s Milner, I give you, I fear, &s;ome unkind proofs of my regard&mdash;it is often the ungrateful ta&s;k of a friend to be trouble&s;ome&mdash;&s;ometimes un|mannerly.&mdash;Forgive the duty of my office, and believe no one is half &s;o much concerned if it robs you of any amu&s;ements, as I my&s;elf am."</P>
<P>What he &s;aid, he looked with &s;o much &s;incerity, that had &s;he been burning with rage at his behavi|our, &s;he mu&s;t have forgiven him, for the regret he &s;o forcibly expre&s;t.&mdash;She was going to reply, but found &s;he could not without accompanying her words with tears, therefore as &s;oon as &s;he attempt|ed &s;he de&s;i&s;ted.</P>
<P>On this he ro&s;e from his &s;eat, and going to her, &s;aid, "Once more &s;how your &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion by obey|ing me a &s;econd time to-day. Keep your appoint|ment, and be a&s;&s;ured I &s;hall i&s;&s;ue my commands with greater circum&s;pection for the future, as I find how &s;trictly they are complied with."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner, the gay, the proud, the haughty Mi&s;s Milner, &s;unk underneath this kindne&s;s, and wept with a gentlene&s;s and patience, which did not give more &s;urpri&s;e than it gave &s;atisfaction to

Dorriforth.&mdash;He was charmed to find her di&s;po&s;i|tion &s;o little untractable&mdash;foreboded the future pro&s;perity of his guardian&s;hip, and her eternal as well as temporal happine&s;s from this &s;pecimen.</P>

<P>ALTHOUGH Dorriforth was that good man that has been de&s;cribed, there were in his nature &s;hades of evil&mdash;there was an ob&s;tinacy; &s;uch as he him&s;elf, and his friends termed firmne&s;s of mind; but had not religion and &s;ome oppo&s;ite virtues weighed heavy in the balance, it would frequently have degenerated into implacable &s;tubbornne&s;s.</P>
<P>The child of a once beloved &s;i&s;ter, who married a young officer again&s;t her brother's con&s;ent, was at the age of three years left an orphan, de&s;titute of every &s;upport but from his uncle's genero&s;ity: but though Dorriforth mentioned, he would never &s;ee him, Mi&s;s Milner who&s;e heart was a receptacle for the unfortunate, no &s;ooner was told the melan|choly hi&s;tory of Mr. and Mrs. Ru&s;brook, the pa|rents of the child, than &s;he longed to behold the innocent inheritor of her guardian's re&s;entment, and took Mi&s;s Woodley with her to &s;ee the boy&mdash;he was at a farm hou&s;e a few miles from town; and his extreme beauty and engaging manners, needed not the &s;orrows to which he had been born, to give him farther recommendation to the kind|ne&s;s of her, who had come to vi&s;it him. She be|held him with admiration and pity, and having en|deared her&s;elf to him by the mo&s;t affectionate words and care&s;&s;es, on her bidding him farewell, he cried mo&s;t &s;orrowfully to go along with her. Unu&s;ed
<PB N="35" REF="025650_0038_0FCEB12A974BC690">
to re&s;i&s;t temptations, whether to reprehen&s;ible, or to laudable actions, &s;he yielded to his &s;upplicati|ons, and having overcome a few &s;cruples of Mi&s;s Woodley's, determined to take young Ru&s;brook to town, and pre&s;ent him to his uncle. This idea was no &s;ooner formed than executed.&mdash;By making a pre&s;ent to the nur&s;e, &s;he readily gained her con|&s;ent to part with him for a day or two, and the &s;igns of joy the child denoted on being put into the carriage, &s;eemed to repay her before-hand, for every reproof &s;he might receive from her guar|dian, for the liberty &s;he had taken.</P>
<P>"Be&s;ides," &s;aid &s;he to Mi&s;s Woodley, who had &s;till her apprehen&s;ions, "do you not with his un|cle &s;hould have &s;ome warmer intere&s;t in his care than duty?&mdash;it is that alone, which induces Mr. Dorriforth to provide for him, but it is proper, affection &s;hould have &s;ome &s;hare in his benevolence&mdash;and how, hereafter, will he be &s;o fit an object for that love, which compa&s;&s;ion mu&s;t excite, as he is at pre&s;ent?"</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley acquie&s;ced.&mdash;But before they ar|rived at their own door, it came into Mi&s;s Milner's remembrance, there was a grave &s;ternne&s;s in the manners of her guardian when provoked: the re|collection of which made her &s;omething apprehen|&s;ive for what &s;he had done&mdash;Mi&s;s Woodley was more &s;o.&mdash;They both became &s;ilent as they ap|proached the &s;treet where they lived&mdash;for Mi&s;s Woodley having once repre&s;ented her fears, and having &s;uppre&s;&s;ed them in re&s;ignation to Mi&s;s Mil|ner's better judgment, would not repeat them&mdash;and Mi&s;s Milner would not confe&s;s they were now troubling her.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t, however, as the coach &s;topt, &s;he had the foreca&s;t and the humility to &s;ay, "we will not tell Mr. Dorriforth the child is his nephew, Mi&s;s
<PB N="36" REF="025650_0039_0FCEB12C0B7EDF00">
Woodley, unle&s;s he &s;hould appear fond, and plea&s;|ed with him, and then we may venture without any danger."</P>
<P>This was agreed, and when Dorriforth entered the room ju&s;t before dinner, poor Harry Ru&s;brook was introduced to him as the &s;on of a lady who frequently vi&s;ited there. The deception pa&s;&s;ed&mdash;Dorriforth &s;hook hands with him, and at length highly plea&s;ed with his engaging wiles, and applica|ble replies, took him on his knee, and ki&s;&s;ed him with affection. Mi&s;s Milner could &s;carcely re&s;train the joy this gave her; but, unluckily, Dorriforth &s;aid &s;oon after to the child, "and now tell me your name."</P>
<P>"Harry Ru&s;brook," replied he with great force and clearne&s;s in his voice.</P>
<P>Dorriforth was holding him fondly round the wai&s;t as he &s;tood with his feet upon his knees; and at this reply he did not throw him from him&mdash;but he removed his hands, which &s;upported him, &s;o &s;uddenly, that the child to prevent falling on the floor, threw him&s;elf about his uncle's neck.&mdash;Mi&s;s Milner and Mi&s;s Woodley turned a&s;ide to conceal their tears. "I had liked to have been down," cried Harry, fearing no other danger.&mdash;But his un|cle took hold of each hand that had twined around him, and placed him immediately on the ground; and dinner being that in&s;tant &s;erved, he gave no greater marks of his re&s;entment than calling for his hat, and walking in&s;tantly out of the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner cried for anger; yet &s;he did not treat with le&s;s kindne&s;s the object of this vexatious circum&s;tance: &s;he held him in her arms all the while &s;he &s;at at table, and repeatedly &s;aid to him, (though he had not the &s;en&s;e to thank her) "&s;he would always be his friend."</P>

being over, &s;he was ea&s;ily prevailed upon to return with poor Ru&s;brook to the farm-hou&s;e, be|fore it was likely his uncle &s;hould come back; ano|ther in&s;tance of obedience which Mi&s;s Woodley was impatient her guardian &s;hould know; &s;he therefore inquired where he was, and &s;ent him a note to acquaint him with it, offering at the &s;ame time an apology for what had happened. He re|turned in the evening &s;eemingly reconciled, nor was a word mentioned of the incident which had occur|red during the day; yet there remained in the au|&s;tere looks of Dorriforth a perfect remembrance of it, and not one trait of compa&s;&s;ion for his haple&s;s nephew.</P>

<P>THERE are few things &s;o mortifying to a proud &s;pirit as to &s;uffer by immediate compari&s;on&mdash;men, can &s;carcely bear this humiliation, but to wo|men the puni&s;hment is intolerable; and Mi&s;s Mil|ner now laboured under the di&s;advantage to a de|gree which gave her no &s;mall inquietude.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Fenton, a young lady of the mo&s;t delicate beauty, elegant manners, gentle di&s;po&s;ition, and di&s;creet conduct, was introduced to Mi&s;s Milner's acquaintance by her guardian; and frequently, &s;ometimes inadvertently, held up by him as a pat|tern for her to follow&mdash;for when he did not &s;ay this in direct terms, it was in&s;inuated by the warmth of his panegyrics on tho&s;e virtues in which Mi&s;s Fenton excelled, and his ward was obviou&s;ly deficient. Con&s;cious of her inferiority in the&s;e &s;ub|jects
<PB N="38" REF="025650_0041_0FCEB13141AA3178">
of her guardian's prai&s;e, Mi&s;s Milner, in&s;tead of being in&s;pired to emulation, was provoked to envy.</P>
<P>Not to admire Mi&s;s Fenton was impo&s;&s;ible&mdash;to find a fault in her per&s;on or &s;entiments was equal|ly impo&s;&s;ible&mdash;and yet to love her, was very un|likely.</P>
<P>That &s;erenity of mind which kept her features in a continual placid form, though enchanting at the fir&s;t glance, upon a &s;econd, or third, fatigued the &s;ight for a want of variety; and to have &s;een her di&s;torted with rage, convul&s;ed with mirth, or in deep dejection, had been to her advantage. But her &s;uperior &s;oul appeared above tho&s;e natural commotions of the mind, and there was more in|ducement to wor&s;hip her as a &s;aint, than to love her as a woman.&mdash;Yet Dorriforth, who&s;e heart was not formed, (at lea&s;t not educated) for love; re|garding her in the light of friend&s;hip, beheld her as the mo&s;t perfect model of her &s;ex. Lord Frede|rick, on fir&s;t &s;eeing her, was &s;truck with her beau|ty, and Mi&s;s Milner apprehended &s;he had introdu|ced a rival; but he had not &s;een her three times, before he called her the mo&s;t "in&s;ufferable of Hea|ven's creatures," and vowed there was more charm|ing variation in the features of Mi&s;s Woodley.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner had a heart affectionate to her &s;ex, even where &s;he &s;aw them in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of charms &s;uperior to her own; but whether from the &s;pirit of contradiction, whether from feeling her&s;elf more than ordinarily offended by her guardian's prai&s;e of this lady, or whether there was &s;omething in the re&s;erve of Mi&s;s Fenton that did not accord with her own frank and ingenuous di&s;po&s;ition &s;o as to engage her e&s;teem, it is certain &s;he took infinite &s;a|tisfaction in hearing her beauty and her virtues de|preciated, or turned to ridicule, particularly if Mr.
<PB N="39" REF="025650_0042_0FCEB132B5875A98">
Dorriforth was pre&s;ent. This was very painful to him upon many accounts; perhaps regard to Mi&s;s Milner's conduct was not among the lea&s;t; and whenever the circum&s;tance occurred, he could with difficulty re&s;train his anger. Mi&s;s Fenton was not only a young lady who&s;e amiable qualities Dorriforth admired, but &s;he was &s;oon to be allied to him by her marriage with his neare&s;t relation, Lord Elmwood, a young nobleman whom he &s;in|cerely loved.</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood had di&s;covered all that beauty in Mi&s;s Fenton, which every common ob&s;erver could not but &s;ee&mdash;the charms of her mind and her for|tune had been pointed out to him by his tutor; and the utility of their marriage in perfect &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion to his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, his lord&s;hip never permitted him&s;elf to que&s;tion.</P>
<P>This preceptor held with a magi&s;terial power the government of his pupil's pa&s;&s;ions; nay, governed them &s;o entirely, no one could perceive (nor did the young lord him&s;elf know) that he had any.</P>
<P>This rigid monitor and friend was a Mr. Sand|ford, bred a je&s;uit in the &s;ame college where Dorri|forth was educated, but before his time the order was compelled to take another name.&mdash;Sandford had been the tutor of Dorriforth, as well as of his cou&s;in Lord Elmwood, and by this double <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;eemed now entailed upon the family.&mdash;As a je&s;uit, he was con&s;equently a man of learning; po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;teadine&s;s to accompli&s;h the end of any de&s;ign once meditated, and of wi&s;dom to direct the con|duct of men more powerful, but le&s;s ingenious than him&s;elf. The young earl, accu&s;tomed in his infan|cy to fear him as his ma&s;ter, in his youth and man|hood received every new indulgence with which his preceptor favoured him with gratitude, and be|came
<PB N="40" REF="025650_0043_0FCEB136B478B570">
came at length to love him as his father&mdash;nor had Dorriforth as yet &s;hook off &s;imilar &s;en&s;ations.</P>
<P>Mr. Sandford perfectly knew how to work upon the pa&s;&s;ions of all human nature, but yet had the con&s;cience not to "draw all hearts towards him." There were of mankind, tho&s;e, who&s;e hate he thought not unworthy his holy labour; and in that he was more rapid in his &s;ucce&s;s than even in pro|curing e&s;teem. In this enterprize he &s;ucceeded with Mi&s;s Milner, even beyond his mo&s;t &s;anguine with.</P>
<P>She had been educated at an Engli&s;h boarding-&s;chool, and had no idea of the &s;uperior and &s;ubor|dinate &s;tate of a foreign &s;eminary&mdash;be&s;ides, as a woman, &s;he was privileged to &s;ay any thing &s;he plea&s;ed; and as a beautiful woman, &s;he had a right to expect whatever &s;he plea&s;ed to &s;ay, &s;hould be admired.</P>
<P>Sandford knew the hearts of women, as well as tho&s;e of men, notwith&s;tanding he had pa&s;&s;ed but little of his time in their &s;ociety&mdash;he &s;aw Mi&s;s Mil|ner's heart at the fir&s;t view of her per&s;on; and be|holding in that little circumference a weight of folly he wi&s;hed to &s;ee eradicated, he began to toil in the vineyard, eager to draw upon him her de|te&s;tation, in the hope he could al&s;o make her abo|minate her&s;elf. The mortifications of &s;light he was expert in, and being a man of talents, &s;uch as all companies, e&s;pecially tho&s;e Mi&s;s Milner often frequented, looked on with re&s;pect, he did not be|gin by wa&s;ting that reverence &s;o highly valued up|on ineffectual remon&s;trances, of which he could fore&s;ee the reception, but awakened the attention of the lady &s;olely by his neglect of her. He &s;poke of her in her pre&s;ence as of an indifferent per&s;on, &s;ometimes forgot to name her when the &s;ubject re|quired it; and then would a&s;k her pardon and
<PB N="41" REF="025650_0044_0FCEB137F5BC7070">
&s;ay, "he did not recollect her," with &s;uch &s;eeming &s;orrow for his fault, &s;he could not think the of|fence intended, and of cour&s;e felt the affront much more &s;everely.</P>
<P>While, with every other per&s;on, &s;he was the principal, the fir&s;t cau&s;e upon which a whole com|pany depended for conver&s;ation, mu&s;ic, cards, or dancing, with Mr. Sandford &s;he found &s;he was of no importance.&mdash;Sometimes &s;he tried to con&s;ider this di&s;regard of her as merely the effect of ill-breeding, but he was not an ill-bred man; he was a gentleman by birth, and one who had kept the be&s;t company; a man of &s;en&s;e and learning.&mdash;'And does &s;uch a man &s;light me without knowing it?' &s;he cried&mdash;for &s;he had not dived &s;o deep into the powers of &s;imulation, as to &s;u&s;pect &s;uch carele&s;s manners were the re&s;ult of art.</P>
<P>This behaviour of Mr. Sandford's had its de&s;ired effect; it humbled Mi&s;s Milner in her own opinion more than a thou&s;and &s;ermons would have done preached on the vanity of youth and beauty. She felt an inward nothingne&s;s &s;he never knew before, and had been cured of all her pride, had &s;he not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a degree of &s;pirit beyond the generality of her &s;ex, and &s;uch as even Mr. Sandford with all his penetration did not expect.&mdash;She determined to re&s;ent his treatment, and entering the li&s;t as his de|clared enemy, give rea&s;ons to the beholders why he did not, with them, acknowledge her &s;ove|reignty.</P>
<P>She now commenced ho&s;tilities on all his argu|ments, his learning, and his favourite axioms; and by a happy turn for ridicule, in want of other weapons, threw in the way of the holy father as great trials for his patience, as any his order could have &s;ub&s;tituted in penance. Some things he bore like a martyr&mdash;at others, his fortitude would for|&s;ake
<PB N="42" REF="025650_0045_0FCEB139D8B79B30">
him, and he would call on her guardian, his late pupil, to interpo&s;e with his authority; on which &s;he would declare &s;he only acted "to try the good man's temper," and had he combated with his fretfulne&s;s but a few minutes longer, &s;he would have acknowledged his right to canonization; but having yielded to the &s;allies of his anger, he mu&s;t now go through numerous other probations."</P>
<P>If Mi&s;s Fenton was admired by Dorriforth, by Sandford &s;he was adored&mdash;and in&s;tead of giving her as an example to Mi&s;s Milner, he &s;poke of her as of one, endowed beyond Mi&s;s Milner's power of imitation.&mdash;Often with a &s;hake of his head and a &s;igh would he &s;ay,</P>
<P>"No, I am not &s;o hard upon you as your guar|dian, I only de&s;ire you to love Mi&s;s Fenton; to re|&s;emble her, I believe, is above your ability."</P>
<P>This was &s;omething too much&mdash;and poor Mi&s;s Woodley, who was generally a witne&s;s of the&s;e con|trover&s;ies, &s;uffered a degree of &s;orrow at every &s;en|tence that di&s;tre&s;t Mi&s;s Milner.&mdash;Yet as &s;he &s;uffer|ed for Mr. Sandford too, the joy of her friend's re|ply was abated by the unea&s;ine&s;s it gave to him. But Mrs. Horton felt for none but the right reve|rend prie&s;t; and often did &s;he feel &s;o violently in|tere&s;ted in his cau&s;e, &s;he could not refrain giving an an&s;wer her&s;elf in his behalf&mdash;thus, doing the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">uty of an adver&s;ary.</P>

<P>MR. Sandford finding his friend Dorriforth frequently perplexed in the management of his
<PB N="43" REF="025650_0046_0FCEB13D188F8190">
ward, and he him&s;elf thinking her incorrigible, gave his advice, that a proper match &s;hould be im|mediately &s;ought out for her, and the care of &s;o dangerous a per&s;on given into other hands. Dor|riforth acknowledged the propriety of this coun|&s;el, but lamented the difficulty there was in plea&s;|ing his ward as to the quality of her lover, for &s;he had refu&s;ed, be&s;ides Sir Edward A&s;hton, many others of equal preten&s;ions. "Depend upon it then," cried Mr. Sandford, "her affections are already engaged, and it is proper you &s;hould know to whom." Dorriforth thought he did know, and mentioned Lord Frederick Lawnly; but &s;aid he had no further authority for the &s;uppo&s;ition, than what his ob&s;ervation had given him, for that every explanation both on his lord&s;hip's &s;ide, and on that of the lady's, were evaded.&mdash;"Take her then," cried Sandford, "into the country, and if his lord|&s;hip does not follow, there is an end <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> your &s;u&s;|picions."&mdash;"I &s;hall not ea&s;ily prevail upon Mi&s;s Milner to leave the town," replied Dorriforth, "while it is in its highe&s;t fa&s;hion; while all the gay world are re&s;orted hither."&mdash;"You can but try," returned Sandford, "and if you &s;hould not &s;ucceed now; at lea&s;t fix the time you mean to go dur|ing the Autumn, and keep to your determination." "But in the Autumn," replied Dorriforth, "Lord Frederick will of cour&s;e be in the country, and as his uncle's e&s;tate is near to our re&s;idence, he will not then &s;o evidently follow Mi&s;s Milner, as he would, could I induce her to go now."</P>
<P>It was agreed the attempt &s;hould be made&mdash;and in&s;tead of receiving the propo&s;al with unea&s;ine&s;s, Mi&s;s Milner, to the &s;urpri&s;e of every one pre&s;ent, immediately con&s;ented; and gave her guardian an opportunity of &s;aying &s;everal of the kinde&s;t and polite&s;t things upon her ready compliance.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="025650_0047_0FCEB13E045FB870">
"A token of approbation from you, Mr. Dor|riforth," returned &s;he, "I always con&s;idered with the highe&s;t e&s;timation&mdash;but your commendations are now become infinitely &s;uperior in value, by their &s;carcity; for I do not believe that &s;ince Mi&s;s Fenton and Mr. Sandford came to town, I have received one te&s;timony of your friend&s;hip."</P>
<P>Had the&s;e words been uttered with plea&s;antry, they might have pa&s;&s;ed without ob&s;ervation; but at the conclu&s;ion of the period, re&s;entment flew to Mi&s;s Milner's face, and &s;he darted a piercing look at Mr. Sandford, which more pointedly expre&s;&s;ed &s;he was angry with him, than had &s;he &s;poken vo|lumes in her u&s;ual &s;train of raillery.&mdash;Dorriforth looked confu&s;ed.&mdash;But the concern which &s;he had &s;o plainly evinced for his good opinion through|out what &s;he had &s;aid, &s;ilenced any rebuke he might el&s;e have been tempted to give her, for this unwarrantable charge again&s;t his friend. Mrs. Hor|ton was &s;hocked at the irregular manner in which Mr. Sandford was treated&mdash;while Mi&s;s Woodley turned to him with a &s;mile upon her face, hoping to &s;et him an example of the manner in which he &s;hould receive this reproach.&mdash;Her good wi&s;hes did not &s;ucceed&mdash;yet he was perfectly unruffled, and replied with coolne&s;s.</P>
<P>"The air of the country has affected the young lady already&mdash;but it is a comfortable thing," con|tinued he, "that in the variety of humours &s;ome women are expo&s;ed to, they cannot be &s;teadfa&s;t even in deceit."</P>
<P>"Deceit," cried Mi&s;s Milner, "In what am I deceitful? did I ever pretend, Sir, I had an e&s;teem for you."</P>
<P>"That had not been deceit, madam, but merely good manners."</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="025650_0048_0FCEB13F753B9428">
"I never, Mr. Sandford, &s;acrificed truth to po|litene&s;s."</P>
<P>"Except when the country has been propo&s;ed, and you thought it politene&s;s to appear &s;atisfied."</P>
<P>"And I was &s;atisfied, till I recollected you might probably be of the party&mdash;then every grove was changed to a wilderne&s;s, every rivulet into a &s;tag|nated pool, and every &s;inging bird into a croaking raven."</P>
<P>"A very poetical de&s;cription," returned he calmly.&mdash;"But, Mi&s;s Milner, you need not have had any apprehen&s;ions of my company in the coun|try, for I under&s;tand the &s;eat to which your guar|dian means to go, belongs to you; and depend up|on it, madam, I &s;hall never enter a hou&s;e where you are the mi&s;tre&s;s."</P>
<P>"Nor any hou&s;e, I am certain, Mr. Sandford, but where you your&s;elf are the ma&s;ter."</P>
<P>"What do you mean, madam? (and for the fir&s;t time he elevated his voice) am I the ma&s;ter here?"</P>
<P>"Your &s;ervants," replied &s;he, looking at the company, "will not tell you &s;o, but I do."</P>
<P>"You conde&s;cend, Mr. Sandford," cried Mrs. Horton, "in talking &s;o much to a young woman, but I know you do it for her good."</P>
<P>"Well, Mi&s;s Milner," cried Dorriforth, (and the mo&s;t cutting thing he could &s;ay) &s;ince I find my propo&s;al of the country has put you out of hu|mour, I &s;hall mention it no more."</P>
<P>With all that va&s;t quantity of re&s;entment, anger, or rage which &s;ometimes boiled in the veins of Mi&s;s Milner, &s;he was yet never wanting in that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e|&s;pect towards her guardian, which with-held her from uttering one angry &s;entence, immediately di|rected to him; and a &s;evere word on his &s;ide, in|&s;tead of exa&s;perating, was &s;ure to &s;often her.

<P>"To prove mine was &s;uch, madam," replied Dorriforth, "be prepared to quit London, with|out any marks of regret, within a few days."</P>
<P>She bowed a&s;&s;ent; the nece&s;&s;ary preparations were agreed upon; and while Mi&s;s Milner with ap|parent &s;atisfaction adju&s;ted the plan of her jour|ney, (like tho&s;e per&s;ons who behave well, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;o much to plea&s;e them&s;elves as to vex their enemies) &s;he &s;ecretly triumphed in the mortification &s;he &s;up|po&s;ed Mr. Sandford would receive, from her obedi|ent behaviour.</P>
<P>The news of this intended journey was &s;oon made public. There is a &s;ecret charm in being pitied, when the misfortune is but ideal, and Mi&s;s Milner found immen&s;e gratification in being told, "her's was a cruel ca&s;e," and that it was "unju&s;t and bar|barous to force &s;o much beauty to be concealed in the country, while London was filled with admir|ers; who, like her, would langui&s;h in con&s;equence of the &s;eparation." The&s;e things, and a thou&s;and &s;uch, a thou&s;and times repeated, &s;he &s;till li&s;tened

to with plea&s;ure; yet pre&s;erved the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;tancy not to &s;hrink from her re&s;olution of &s;ubmitting.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e &s;ighs, which Mi&s;s Woodley had long ago ob&s;erved, became, however, more frequent &s;till; and a tear half &s;tarting to her eye, was an addi|tional matter of her friend's ob&s;ervation. Yet though Mi&s;s Milner at tho&s;e times was &s;oftened to melancholy, &s;he by no means appeared unhappy. Mi&s;s Woodley was acquainted with the name of love only, yet &s;he concluded from the&s;e increa&s;ed &s;ymptoms, what &s;he before only &s;u&s;pected, that love mu&s;t be their ba&s;is. "Her &s;en&s;es have been captivated by the per&s;on and accompli&s;hments of Lord Frederick," &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley to her&s;elf, "while her under&s;tanding beholds his faults, and reproaches her pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">" cried &s;he, "could her guardian and Mr. Sandford know of this con|flict, how much more would they have to admire than to condemn!"</P>
<P>With the&s;e friendly thoughts, joined to the mo&s;t perfect good intent, Mi&s;s Woodley did not fail to give both gentlem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n to believe, a contention of this nature was the pre&s;ent &s;tate of Mi&s;s Milner's mind.&mdash;Dorriforth was affected at the de&s;cription, and Sandford urged more than ever the nece&s;&s;ity of the country expedition.&mdash;In a few days time they undertook it; Mrs. Horton, Mi&s;s Woodley, Mi&s;s Milner, and Mr. Dorriforth, accompanied by Mi&s;s Fenton, whom Mi&s;s Milner, as &s;he knew it to be the wi&s;h of her guardian, invited to pa&s;s the three months previous to her marriage, at her country &s;eat. Elmwood Hou&s;e, or rather ca&s;tle, the &s;eat of Lord Elmwood, was only a few miles from this re&s;idence, and his lord&s;hip was expected to pa&s;s great part of the &s;ummer there, with his tu|tor, Mr. Sandford.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="025650_0051_0FCEB16BB6B376B8">
In the neighbourhood was al&s;o an e&s;tate belong|ing to an uncle of lord Frederick's, and many of the company &s;u&s;pected they &s;hould &s;oon &s;ee his lord&s;hip on a vi&s;it there, and to that expectation did they in great mea&s;ure attribute Mi&s;s Milner's vi&s;ible content.</P>

<P>WITH this party Mi&s;s Milner arrived at her country hou&s;e, and for near &s;ix weeks all around was the perfect picture of tranquillity;&mdash;her &s;atis|faction was as evident as every other per&s;on's; and every &s;evere reflection being at this time unnece&s;&s;a|ry, either to teize her to her duty, or to warn her again&s;t follies, &s;he was even in perfect good hu|mour with Mi&s;s Fenton, and added to the ho&s;pi|tality of a ho&s;t, the kindne&s;s of a friend.</P>
<P>Mr. Sandford, who came with Lord Elmwood to the neighbouring &s;eat, about a week after the arri|val of Mi&s;s Milner at her's, was &s;o &s;crupulou&s;ly exact in the ob&s;ervance of his word, "never to en|ter a hou&s;e of Mi&s;s Milner's," that he would not even call upon his friend Dorriforth there&mdash;but in their walks, and at Lord Elmwood's, the two parties would occa&s;ionally join, and of cour&s;e Sandford and &s;he at tho&s;e times met&mdash;yet &s;o di&s;tant was the re&s;erve on either &s;ide, that not a &s;ingle word was, upon any occa&s;ion, ever exchanged between them.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner did not like Mr. Sandford; yet, as there was no real cau&s;e for inveterate rancour, ad|miring him too as a man who meant well, and be|ing be&s;ides of a mo&s;t forgiving temper, &s;he frequent|ly
<PB N="49" REF="025650_0052_0FCE9F044AB0EC58">
felt concerned that he did not &s;peak to her, al|though it had been to find fault as u&s;ual&mdash;and one morning as they were all, after a long ramble, drawing towards her hou&s;e, where Lord Elmwood was invited to dine, &s;he even bur&s;t into tears at &s;ee|ing Sandford turn back and wi&s;h them a "good day."</P>
<P>But though &s;he had genero&s;ity to forgive an af|front, &s;he had not the humility to make a conce&s;|&s;ion; and &s;he fore&s;aw that nothing le&s;s than &s;ome very humble atonement on her part, would prevail upon the haughty prie&s;t to be reconciled. Dorri|forth &s;aw her concern upon this trifling occa&s;ion with a &s;ecret plea&s;ure, and an admiration &s;he had never before excited. She in&s;inuated to him to be a mediator between them; but before any accom|modation could take place, the peace and compo|&s;ure of their abode was di&s;turbed by the arrival of Sir Edward A&s;hton at Lord Elmwood's, where it appeared as if he had been invited in order to pur|&s;ue his matrimonial plan.</P>
<P>At a dinner at Lord Elmwood's Sir Edward was announced as an unexpected vi&s;itor; Mi&s;s Milner did not &s;uppo&s;e him &s;uch, and turned pale when his name was uttered&mdash;Dorriforth fixed his eyes upon her with &s;ome tokens of compa&s;&s;ion, while Sandford &s;eemed to exult, and by his repeated "Welcome," to the baronet, gave evident proofs how much he was rejoiced to &s;ee him. All the de|clining enmity of Mi&s;s Milner, was renewed at this behaviour, and &s;u&s;pecting Sandford to be the in&s;ti|gator of his vi&s;it, &s;he could not overcome her di&s;|plea&s;ure, but gave way to it in a manner &s;he thought the mo&s;t mortifying.&mdash;Sir Edward, in the cour&s;e of conver&s;ation, inquired "what neighbours were in the country;" and &s;he, with the highe&s;t appear|ance
<PB N="50" REF="025650_0053_0FCEB17001D51DC0">
of &s;atisfaction, named Lord Frederick Lawn|ly; as one who was hourly expected at his uncle's. The colour &s;pread over Sir Edward's face.&mdash;Dorri|forth looked confounded&mdash;and Mr. Sandford as if he could have &s;truck her.</P>
<P>"Did Lord Frederick tell <HI>you</HI> he &s;hould be down?" Sandford a&s;ked Dorriforth.</P>
<P>To which he replied, "No."</P>
<P>"But I hope, Mr. Sandford, you will permit me to know," cried Mi&s;s Milner.&mdash;For as &s;he now meant to torture him by what &s;he &s;aid, &s;he no long|er con&s;trained her&s;elf to &s;ilence&mdash;and as he har|boured the &s;ame kind intent towards her, he had no longer any objection to make a reply, and therefore an&s;wered,</P>
<P>"No, madam, if it depended upon my permi&s;|&s;ion, you &s;hould not know."</P>
<P>"Not any thing, Sir, I dare &s;ay;&mdash;you would keep me in utter ignorance."</P>
<P>"I would."</P>
<P>"From a &s;elf-intere&s;ted motive, Mr. Sandford&mdash;that I might have a greater re&s;pect for you."</P>
<P>Some of the per&s;ons pre&s;ent laughed&mdash;Mrs. Hor|ton coughed&mdash;Mi&s;s Woodley blu&s;hed&mdash;Lord Elm|wood &s;neered&mdash;Dorriforth frowned&mdash;and Mi&s;s Fen|ton looked ju&s;t as &s;he did before.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation was changed as &s;oon as po&s;|&s;ible, and early in the evening the company re|turned home.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner had &s;carce left her dre&s;&s;ing room, where &s;he had been taking off part of her dre&s;s, when Dorriforth's &s;ervant came to acquaint her his ma&s;ter was alone in his &s;tudy, and begged to &s;peak with her.&mdash;She felt her&s;elf tremble&mdash;&s;he im|mediately experienced a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s &s;he had not acted properly at Lord Elmwood's; for &s;he had a

a pre&s;cience her guardian was going to upbraid her, and her heart told her, he had never yet re|proached her without a cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley ju&s;t then entered the apartment, and &s;he even found her&s;elf &s;o much a coward, as to propo&s;e her going to Dorriforth along with her, and aiding her with a word or two occa&s;ionally in her excu&s;e.</P>
<P>"What you, my dear," returned Mi&s;s Wood|ley, "who not two hours ago, had the courage to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">indicate your own cau&s;e before a whole com|pany, of whom many were your adver&s;aries; do you want an advocate before your guardian only? and he who has ever treated you with tender|ne&s;s."</P>
<P>"It is that tenderne&s;s which frightens me, Mi&s;s Woodley; that intimidates, and &s;trikes me dumb&mdash;is it po&s;&s;ible I can return impertinence to the language and manners Mr. Dorriforth u&s;es? and as I am debarred from that, what can I do but &s;tand before him like a guilty creature, acknow|ledging my faults."</P>
<P>She again entreated Mi&s;s Woodley to go with her, but on a po&s;itive refu&s;al, from the impropriety of &s;uch an intru&s;ion, &s;he was at length obliged to go by her&s;elf.</P>
<P>How much do different circum&s;tances influence not only the manners, but even the per&s;ons of &s;ome people!&mdash;Mi&s;s Milner in the drawing room at Lord Elmwood's &s;urrounded by li&s;teners, by ad|mirers, (for even her enemies beheld her with ad|miration,) and warm with their approbation and applau&s;e&mdash;and Mi&s;s Milner, with no giddy ob|&s;erver to give a fal&s;e eclat &s;o her actions, left de&s;ti|tute of all but her own under&s;tanding, (which &s;e|cretly condemns her,) and upon the point of re|ceiving the cen&s;ure of her guardian and friend, are two different beings.&mdash;Though &s;till beautiful be|yond

de&s;cription, &s;he does not look even in per&s;on the &s;ame.&mdash;In the la&s;t mentioned &s;ituation, &s;he was &s;horter in &s;tature than in the former&mdash;&s;he was paler&mdash;&s;he was thinner&mdash;and a very different con|tour pre&s;ided over her whole air, and all her fea|tures.</P>
<P>When &s;he arrived at the &s;tudy door, &s;he opened it with a trepidation &s;he could hardly account for, and entered to Dorriforth the altered woman &s;he has been repre&s;ented. His heart had taken the mo&s;t decided part again&s;t her, and his face a&s;&s;umed the mo&s;t &s;evere a&s;pect of reproach; when her ap|pearance gave an in&s;tantaneous change to <HI>his</HI> whole mind, and countenance.</P>
<P>She halted, as if &s;he feared to approach&mdash;he he|&s;itated, as if he knew not how to &s;peak&mdash;In&s;tead of the warmth with which he was prepared to be|gin, his voice involuntarily &s;oftened, and without knowing what he &s;aid, he began,</P>
<P>"My dear Mi&s;s Milner"&mdash;</P>
<P>She expected he was angry, and in her confu&s;ion his gentlene&s;s was lo&s;t upon her&mdash;&s;he imagined what he &s;aid might be &s;evere, and &s;he continued to tremble, although he repeatedly a&s;&s;ured her, he meant only to advi&s;e, not to upbraid her.</P>
<P>"For in re&s;pect to all tho&s;e little di&s;putes be|tween Mr. Sandford and you," &s;aid he, "I &s;hould be partial if I blamed you more than him&mdash;indeed, when you take the liberty to cen&s;ure him, his cha|racter makes the freedom appear in a more &s;erious light than when he complains of you&mdash;yet, if he provokes your retorts, he alone mu&s;t an&s;wer for them; nor will I undertake to decide betwixt you.&mdash;But I have a que&s;tion to a&s;k you, and to which I require a &s;erious and unequivocal an&s;wer.&mdash;Do you expect Lord Frederick in the country?"</P>
<P>Without he&s;itation &s;he replied, "&s;he did."</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="025650_0056_0FCE9F0962EBD5A8">
"I have one more que&s;tion to a&s;k, madam, and and to which I expect a reply equally unre&s;erved&mdash;Is Lord Frederick the man you approve for a hu&s;|band?"</P>
<P>Upon this clo&s;e interrogation &s;he di&s;covered an embarra&s;&s;ment, and a confu&s;ion beyond any &s;he had ever before given proofs of; and in this &s;ituation &s;he faintly replied,</P>
<P>"No, he is not."</P>
<P>"Your words tell me one thing," an&s;wered Dor|riforth, "while your looks declare another&mdash;which am I to tru&s;t?"</P>
<P>"Which you plea&s;e," &s;he returned with an in|&s;ulted dignity, that a&s;toni&s;hed, awed, yet did not convince him.</P>
<P>"But then, why encourage him to follow you thither, Mi&s;s Milner?"</P>
<P>"Why commit a thou&s;and follies (&s;he replied in tears) every hour of my life?"</P>
<P>"You then promote the hopes of Lord Frede|rick without one &s;erious intention of compleating them? This is a conduct which it is my duty to guard you again&s;t, and you &s;hall no longer deceive either him or your&s;elf. The moment he arrives it is my fixed re&s;olution you refu&s;e to &s;ee him, or agree to become his wife."</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to this, &s;he appeared aver&s;e both to the one propo&s;ition and the other, yet came to no ex|planation why; but left her guardian at the con|clu&s;ion of the conver&s;ation as much at a lo&s;s to de|cide upon her real &s;entiments, as he was before he had thus &s;eriou&s;ly reque&s;ted to be informed of ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">; but having &s;tedfa&s;tly taken the re&s;olution which he had declared to her, he found that deter|mination a certain relief to his mind.</P>

<P>SIR EDWARD ASHTON, though not invited by Mi&s;s Milner, yet frequently did him&s;elf the favour to come to her hou&s;e; &s;ometimes he accompanied Lord Elmwood on a vi&s;it to her, at other times he came to &s;ee Dorriforth only, who generally intro|duced him to the ladies. But Sir Edward was either &s;o unwilling to give pain to the object of his love, or &s;o much intimidated by her frowns, that he &s;eldom addre&s;&s;ed a &s;ingle word to her, except the common compliments of entering and retiring.&mdash;This apprehen&s;ion of offending, without one hope of plea&s;ing, had the mo&s;t awkward effect upon the manners of the worthy baronet, and his endeavours to in&s;inuate him&s;elf into the affections of the woman he loved, merely by the means of not giving her offence either by &s;peaking or look|ing at her, was a circum&s;tance &s;o whim&s;ical, that it frequently forced a &s;mile from Mi&s;s Milner, though the very name of Sir Edward was of power to throw a gloom over her face; for &s;he looked upon him as the cau&s;e why &s;he &s;hould be hurried to make an election of a lover, before her own mind could well direct her where to fix.&mdash;Be&s;ides, his pur&s;uit was a trouble, while it was not the &s;malle&s;t triumph to her vanity, which, by the ad|dre&s;&s;es of Lord Frederick, was in the highe&s;t man|ner gratified.</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip now arrives in the country, and calls at Mi&s;s Milner's; his guardian &s;ees his chariot coming along the lawn, and gives orders to the &s;ervants to &s;ay their lady is not at home, but that Mr. Dorriforth is; Lord Frederick leaves his com|pliments and goes away.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="025650_0058_0FCEB14179CAE818">
The ladies all &s;aw his carriage and &s;ervants at the door; Mi&s;s Milner flew to the gla&s;s to adju&s;t her dre&s;s, and in her looks expre&s;&s;ed &s;igns of pal|pitation&mdash;but in vain &s;he keeps her eyes fixed upon the door of the apartment; he does not enter.</P>
<P>After &s;ome minutes expectation, the door opens and her guardian comes in; &s;he was di&s;appointed, he perceived &s;he was, and he looked at her with a very &s;erious face; &s;he immediately called to mind the a&s;&s;urance he had given her "that her acquaint|ance with Lord Frederick in its pre&s;ent &s;tate &s;hould not continue," and between chagrin and confu&s;ion, &s;he was at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> how to behave.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the ladies were all pre&s;ent, Dor|riforth &s;aid to her, without the &s;malle&s;t re&s;erve, "Perhaps, Mi&s;s Milner, you may think I have taken an unwarrantable liberty in giving orders to your &s;ervants to deny you to Lord Frederick, but until his lord&s;hip and I have had a private con|ference, or you conde&s;cend to declare your &s;enti|ments more fully in regard to his vi&s;its, I think it my duty to put an end to them."</P>
<P>"You will always perform your duty, Mr. Dorriforth, I have no doubt, whether I concur or not."</P>
<P>"Yet believe me, madam, I &s;hould do it much more cheerfully, could I hope it was &s;anctioned by your inclinations."</P>
<P>"I am not mi&s;tre&s;s of my inclination, Sir, or they &s;hould conform to yours."</P>
<P>"Place them under my directions, madam, and I'll an&s;wer they will."</P>
<P>A &s;ervant entered.&mdash;"Lord Frederick is re|turned, Sir, and &s;ays he &s;hould be glad to &s;ee you."&mdash;"Show him into the &s;tudy," cried Dorriforth ha&s;tily, and ri&s;ing from his &s;eat, left the room.</P>
<P>"I hope they won't quarrel," &s;aid Mrs. Horton, meaning, &s;he thought they would.</P>

"I am &s;orry to &s;ee you &s;o unea&s;y, Mi&s;s Milner," &s;aid Mi&s;s Fenton, with the mo&s;t perfect unconcern.</P>
<P>As the badne&s;s of the weather had prevented their u&s;ual morning's exerci&s;e, the ladies &s;at em|ployed at their needles till the dinner bell called them away.&mdash;"Do you think Lord Frederick is gone?" then, whi&s;pered Mi&s;s Milner to Mi&s;s Woodley.&mdash;"I think not," returned Mi&s;s Wood|ley.&mdash;"Go a&s;k of the &s;ervants, dear creature." And Mi&s;s Woodley went out of the room.&mdash;She &s;oon returned and &s;aid, apart, "He is now getting into his chariot, I &s;aw him pa&s;s ha&s;tily through the hall; he &s;eemed to fly."</P>
<P>"Ladies, the dinner is waiting," cried Mrs. Horton, and they repaired to the dining room; where Dorriforth &s;oon after came, and engro&s;&s;ed their whole attention by his di&s;turbed looks, and unu&s;ual &s;ilence. Before dinner was over, he was, however, more him&s;elf, but &s;till he appeared thoughtful and di&s;&s;atisfied. At the time of their evening walks he excu&s;ed him&s;elf, and was &s;een in a di&s;tant field with Mr. Sandford in earne&s;t con|ver&s;ation: for they frequently &s;topt on one &s;pot for a quarter of an hour, as if the intere&s;t of the &s;ubject had &s;o totally engaged them, they &s;tood &s;till without knowing it. Lord Elmwood, who had joined the ladies, walked home with them; Dorriforth entered &s;oon after, in a much le&s;s gloomy humour than when he went out, and told his lord&s;hip he and the ladies would dine with him to-morrow if he was di&s;engaged, and it was fixed they &s;hould.</P>
<P>Still Dorriforth was in &s;ome perturbation, but the immediate cau&s;e was concealed till the next day, when about an hour before the company's depar|ture from the Ca&s;tle, Mi&s;s Milner and Mi&s;s Wood|ley were de&s;ired, by a &s;ervant, to walk into a &s;epa|rate
<PB N="57" REF="025650_0060_0FCEB14335612170">
apartment, where they found Dorriforth with Mr. Sandford waiting their coming. Her guard|ian made an apology to Mi&s;s Milner for the form, the ceremony, of which he was going to make u&s;e; but he tru&s;ted the extreme weight with which his mind was oppre&s;&s;ed, le&s;t he &s;hould mi&s;take the real &s;entiments of a lady who&s;e happine&s;s depended upon his being correct in the knowledge of them, he tru&s;ted, that would plead his excu&s;e.</P>
<P>"I know, Mi&s;s Milner," continued he, "the world, in general, allows to unmarried women great latitude in di&s;gui&s;ing their minds with re&s;pect to the man they love.&mdash;I too, am willing to pardon any little di&s;&s;imulation that is but con&s;i&s;tent with that mode&s;ty, becoming every woman on the &s;ubject of marriage. But to what point I may limit, or you may think proper to extend this kind of venial deceit, may &s;o widely differ, that it is not impo&s;&s;i|ble I remain wholly unacquainted with your &s;enti|ments, even after you have revealed them to me.&mdash;Under this con&s;ideration, I wi&s;h once more to hear your thoughts in regard to matrimony, and to hear them before one of your own &s;ex, that I may be enabled to form my opinion by her con|&s;tructions."</P>
<P>To all this &s;erious oration, Mi&s;s Milner made no other reply than by turning to Mr. Sandford, and a&s;king "If he was the per&s;on of her own &s;ex, to who&s;e judgment her guardian meant to &s;ubmit his own?"</P>
<P>"Madam," cried Sandford very angrily, "you are come hither upon &s;erious bu&s;ine&s;s."</P>

<P>"I brought him hither, Madam, or rather brought you to this hou&s;e, merely that he might be pre&s;ent on this occa&s;ion, and with his di&s;cernment relieve me from a &s;u&s;picion, that my own judg|ment can neither &s;uppre&s;s or confirm."</P>
<P>"Is there any more company you may wi&s;h to call in, Sir, to clear up your doubts of my vera|city? If &s;o, pray &s;end for them before you begin your interrogations."</P>
<P>He &s;hook his head&mdash;&s;he continued. "The whole world is welcome to hear what I &s;ay, and every different judge welcome, if they plea&s;e, to judge me differently."</P>
<P>"Dear Mi&s;s Milner,"&mdash;cried Mi&s;s Woodley, with a tone of reproach for the vehemence with which &s;he &s;poke.</P>
<P>"Perhaps, Mi&s;s Milner," &s;aid Dorriforth, "you will not now reply to tho&s;e que&s;tions I was going to put to you?"</P>
<P>"Did I ever refu&s;e, Sir," returned &s;he with a &s;elf-approving air, "to comply with any reque&s;t you have &s;eriou&s;ly made me? Have I ever re|fu&s;ed to obey your commands whenever you thought proper to lay them upon me? If not, you have no right to &s;uppo&s;e I will now."</P>
<P>He was going to reply, when Mr. Sandford &s;ul|lenly interrupted him, and making towards the door, cried, "When you come to the point for which you brought me here, &s;end for me again."</P>
<P>"Stay now," cried Dorriforth. "And Mi&s;s Milner," continued he, "I not only entreat, but command you to tell me&mdash;Have you given your promi&s;es, your word, or your affections to Lord Frederick Lawnley?"</P>
<P>The colour &s;pread over her face, and &s;he replied&mdash;"I thought confe&s;&s;ions were only permitted in &s;e|crecy; however, as I am not a member of your

<P>Sandford, Dorriforth, and Mi&s;s Woodley all looked at each other with a &s;urpri&s;e that was for &s;ome time dumb.&mdash;At length Dorriforth &s;aid, "And it is your firm intention never to become his wife?"</P>
<P>To which &s;he an&s;wered&mdash;"At pre&s;ent it is"</P>
<P>"At pre&s;ent; do you &s;u&s;pect you &s;hall change your &s;entiments?"</P>
<P>"Women &s;ometimes do."</P>
<P>"But before that change can take place, Madam, your acquaintance will be broken off: for it is that, I &s;hall next in&s;i&s;t upon; and to which you can have no objection."</P>
<P>She replied, "I had rather it would continue."</P>
<P>"On what account?" cried Dorriforth.</P>
<P>"Becau&s;e it entertains me."</P>
<P>"For &s;hame, for &s;hame!" returned he, "it endangers both your character and your happine&s;s.&mdash;Yet again, do not &s;uffer me to bre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> with his lord&s;hip if you &s;hould like to become&punc; his wife; if in that re&s;pect it militates again&s;t your felicity."</P>
<P>"By no means," &s;he an&s;wered," "Lord Frede|rick makes part of my amu&s;ement, but could never con&s;titute my felicity."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley," &s;aid Dorriforth, "do you com|prehend your friend in the &s;ame literal unequivo|cal &s;en&s;e I do?"</P>
<P>"Certainly I do, Sir," an&s;wered Mi&s;s Wood|ley.</P>
<P>"And pray, Mi&s;s Woodley," &s;aid he, "were tho&s;e the &s;entiments which you have always enter|tained?"</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley he&s;itated&mdash;he continued. "Or has the pre&s;ent conver&s;ation altered them?"</P>
<P>She he&s;itated again, then an&s;wered&mdash;"The pre|&s;ent conver&s;ation has altered them."</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="025650_0063_0FCEB1787A592A10">
"And yet you confide in it!" cried Sandford, looking at her with contempt.</P>
<P>"Certainly, I do," replied Mi&s;s Woodley.</P>
<P>"Do not you then, Mr. Sandford?" a&s;ked Dorriforth.</P>
<P>"I would advi&s;e you to act the &s;ame as if I did," replied Sandford.</P>
<P>"Then, Mi&s;s Milner," &s;aid Dorriforth, "you &s;ee Lord Frederick no more&mdash;and I hope I have your permi&s;&s;ion to tell him &s;o?"</P>
<P>"You have, Sir," &s;he replied with a completely unembarra&s;&s;ed countenance and voice.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley looked hard at her, to di&s;cover &s;ome lurking wi&s;h adver&s;e to all the&s;e prote&s;tations, but &s;he could not di&s;cern one.&mdash;Sandford too fixed his penetrating eyes as if he would look through her &s;oul, but finding it perfectly compo&s;ed, he cried out,</P>
<P>"Why then not write his lord&s;hip's di&s;mi&s;&s;ion her&s;elf, and &s;ave you, Mr. Dorriforth, the trouble of any farther conte&s;t with him?"</P>
<P>"Indeed, Mi&s;s Milner," &s;aid Dorriforth, "that would oblige me; for it is with the greate&s;t reluc|tance I meet his lord&s;hip upon this &s;ubject&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e was extremely impatient and importunate the la&s;t time he was with me&mdash;he took advantage of my eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;ituation to treat me with a levity, and ill-breeding, I could ill have &s;uffered upon any o|ther con&s;ideration, than the complying with my duty to you."</P>
<P>"Dictate what you plea&s;e, Mr. Dorriforth, and I will write it," &s;aid &s;he with a warmth like the mo&s;t unaffected inclination.&mdash;"And while you, Sir," &s;he continued, "are &s;o indulgent as not to di&s;tre&s;s me with the importunities of any gentle|man to whom I am aver&s;e, I think my&s;elf equally bound to rid you of the impertinence of every one, to whom you may have objection."</P>
<P>"But," an&s;wered he, "be a&s;&s;ured I have no material objection to my Lord Frederick, except

<P>Sandford could not &s;ay yes, and was a&s;hamed to &s;ay no; he, therefore, made no an&s;wer except by his looks, which were full of &s;u&s;picion. She, not|with&s;tanding, made him a very low courte&s;y.&mdash;Her guardian then handed her out of the apart|ment into her coach, which was waiting to take her, Mi&s;s Woodley, and him&s;elf home.</P>

<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the &s;eeming readi|ne&s;s with which Mi&s;s Milner had re&s;igned all far|ther acquaintance with Lord Frederick, during the &s;hort ride home &s;he appeared to have lo&s;t great part of her wonted &s;pirits; &s;he was thoughtful, and once &s;ighed mo&s;t heavily. Dorriforth began to fear &s;he had not only made a &s;acrifice of her affections, but of her veracity; yet, why &s;he had done &s;o, he could not comprehend.</P>
<P>As the carriage moved &s;lowly through a lane between Elmwood Ca&s;tle and her hou&s;e, on ca&s;ting
<PB N="62" REF="025650_0065_0FCEB17CE4842118">
her eyes out of the window, Mi&s;s Milner's coun|tenance was brightened in an in&s;tant, and that in&s;tant Lord Frederick on hor&s;e-back was at the coach door, and the coachman &s;topt.</P>
<P>"Oh, Mi&s;s Milner," cried he, (with a voice and manner that could give little &s;u&s;picion of the truth of what he &s;aid) "I am overjoyed at the happine&s;s of &s;eeing you, even though it is but an accidental meeting."</P>
<P>She was evidently glad to &s;ee him, but the ear|ne&s;tne&s;s with which he &s;poke, put her upon her guard not to expre&s;s the like; and &s;he &s;aid in a cool con&s;trained manner, &s;he "was glad to &s;ee his lord&s;hip."</P>
<P>The re&s;erve with which &s;he &s;poke, gave Lord Frederick immediate &s;u&s;picion who was in the coach with her, and turning his head quickly, he met the &s;tern eye of Dorriforth; upon which, without the &s;malle&s;t &s;alutation he turned from him again abruptly and rudely. Mi&s;s Milner was confu&s;ed, and Mi&s;s Woodley in torture at the palpable af|front; to which Dorriforth appeared alone indif|ferent.</P>
<P>"Go on," &s;aid Mi&s;s Milner to the footman, "de&s;ire the coachman to drive on."</P>
<P>"No," cried Lord Frederick, "not till you have told me when I &s;hall &s;ee you again."</P>
<P>"I will write you word, my Lord," replied &s;he, &s;omething alarmed; "you &s;hall have a letter im|mediately after I get home"</P>
<P>As if he gue&s;&s;ed what its contents were to be, he cried out with warmth, "Take care, then, madam, how you treat me in that letter&mdash;and you, Mr. Dorriforth," turning to him, "do you take care what it contains, for if it is dictated by you, to you I &s;hall &s;end the an&s;wer."</P>
<P>Dorriforth, without making his lord&s;hip a reply, or ca&s;ting a look at him, put his head out of the
<PB N="63" REF="025650_0066_0FCEB14996CC8858">
window on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, and called, in a very angry tone to the coachman, "How dare you not drive on, when your lady orders you?"</P>
<P>The &s;ound of Dorriforth's voice in anger was to the &s;ervants &s;o unu&s;ual, it acted like a &s;troke of electricity on the man, and he drove on at the in|&s;tant &s;o &s;wiftly, that Lord Frederick was in a mo|ment left many yards behind. As &s;oon, however, as he recovered from the &s;urpri&s;e into which this &s;udden command had thrown him, he rode with &s;peed after the carriage, and followed it till they all arrived at the door of Mi&s;s Milner's hou&s;e; where his lord&s;hip, giving him&s;elf up to the rage of love, or to rage again&s;t Dorriforth for the contempt with which he had treated him, leapt from his hor&s;e as Mi&s;s Milner &s;tept from her carriage, and &s;eizing her hand, entreated her "Not to de&s;ert him, in compliance to the mona&s;tic precepts of hypo|cri&s;y."</P>
<P>Dorriforth heard this, &s;tanding &s;ilently by, with a manly &s;corn pointed in his countenance.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner &s;truggled to loo&s;e her hand, &s;aying, "Excu&s;e me from replying to you now, my Lord."</P>
<P>In return to which his lord&s;hip brought her hand to his lips, and began to devour it with ki&s;&s;es, when Dorriforth, with an in&s;tantaneous impul&s;e, ru&s;hed forward, and &s;truck him a blow in the face.&mdash;Un|der the force with which this a&s;&s;ault was given, and the a&s;toni&s;hment it excited, his lord&s;hip &s;tag|gered, and letting fall the hand of Mi&s;s Milner, her guardian immediately laid hold of it, and led her into the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>She was terrified beyond de&s;cription; and it was with difficulty Mr. Dorriforth could get her to her own chamber, without taking her in his arms.&mdash;When, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of her woman,
<PB N="64" REF="025650_0067_0FCEB17DCC196D68">
he had placed her upon a &s;opha&mdash;all &s;hame and confu&s;ion for what he had done, he dropped upon his knees before her, and earne&s;tly, "entreated her forgivene&s;s for the indelicacy he had been guilty of in her pre&s;ence"&mdash;And that he had alarmed her, and lo&s;t &s;ight of the re&s;pect which he thought &s;acredly her due, &s;eemed to be the only circum|&s;tance that dwelt upon his thoughts.</P>
<P>She felt the indecorum of the po&s;ture he had conde&s;cended to take, and was &s;hocked&mdash;to &s;ee her guardian at her feet, &s;truck with the &s;ame impropriety as if &s;he had beheld a parent there; and, all agitation and emotion, &s;he implored him to ri&s;e, and with a thou&s;and prote&s;tations declared, "&s;he thought the ra&s;hne&s;s of the act, was the highe&s;t proof of his regard for her."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley now entered; for her care being ever employed upon the unfortunate, Lord Frede|rick on this occa&s;ion, had been the object of it; and &s;he had waited by his &s;ide, and with every good purpo&s;e, preached patience to him, while he was &s;marting under the pain and &s;hame of his cha&s;ti&s;e|ment.&mdash;At fir&s;t, his fury threatened to retort upon the &s;ervants around him, and who refu&s;ed his en|trance into the hou&s;e, the puni&s;hment he had re|ceived&mdash;But in the certainty of an honourable a|mends which mu&s;t hereafter be made, he overcame the many temptations which the moment offered, and remounting his hor&s;e, rode from the place.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner had Mi&s;s Woodley entered the room, and Dorriforth had re&s;igned to her the care of his ward, than he flew to the &s;pot where he had left his lord&s;hip, negligent what might have been the event had he &s;till remained there.&mdash;After inquir|ing, and being told he was gone, Dorriforth re|turned to his own apartment, and with a bo&s;om torn by more excruciating &s;en&s;ations far, than tho&s;e he had given to his adver&s;ary.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="025650_0068_0FCEB14AF1FABD20">
The remor&s;e that fir&s;t &s;truck him as he &s;hut the door upon him&s;elf was&mdash;I have departed from my character&mdash;from the &s;acred character and dignity of my profe&s;&s;ion and &s;entiments&mdash;I have departed from my&s;elf.&mdash;I am no longer the philo&s;opher, but the ruffian&mdash;I have treated with an unpar|donable in&s;ult a young nobleman, who&s;e only crime was love, and a fond de&s;ire to in&s;inuate him&s;elf into the favour of his mi&s;tre&s;s.&mdash;I mu&s;t atone for this outrage in whatever manner he may choo&s;e, and the law of ju&s;tice and equity (though in this one in&s;tance contrary to the law of religion) en|joins, that if he demands my life, in &s;atisfaction for his wounded honour, it is his due. "Alas," cried he, "that I could have laid it down this morning, un&s;ullied with the cau&s;e, for which it will make but poor atonement."</P>
<P>He next reflected&mdash;I have offended, and filled with horror a beautiful young lady, whom it was my duty to have protected from the brutal manners, to which I my&s;elf have expo&s;ed her.</P>
<P>Again&mdash;I have drawn upon me the ju&s;t re|proaches of my faithful preceptor and friend; the man in who&s;e judgment it was my delight to be ap|proved&mdash;above all, I have drawn upon my&s;elf the the &s;tings of my own con&s;cience.</P>
<P>"Where &s;hall I pa&s;s this &s;leeple&s;s night?" cried he, walking repeatedly acro&s;s his chamber; "Can I go to the ladies? I am a brute, unworthy &s;uch &s;ociety.&mdash;Shall I go and repo&s;e my di&s;turbed mind on Sandford? I am a&s;hamed to tell him the cau&s;e of my unea&s;ine&s;s.&mdash;Shall I go to Lord Frederick, and, humbling my&s;elf before him, beg his forgive|ne&s;s! He would &s;purn me for a coward.&mdash;No"&mdash;(and he lifted up his eyes to Heaven) "Thou all great, all wi&s;e, and all omnipotent being, whom I have above any other offended, to thee alone I
<PB N="66" REF="025650_0069_0FCEB17F4988FE88">
apply in this hour of tribulation, and from thee alone I expect comfort.&mdash;And the confidence with which I now addre&s;s my&s;elf to thee, encouraged by that long intercour&s;e religion has effected, in this one moment pays me amply, for the many years of my pa&s;t life wholly devoted to thy &s;ervice."</P>

<P>ALTHOUGH Mi&s;s Milner had fore&s;een no fatal event from the indignity offered Lord Frederick, yet &s;he pa&s;&s;ed a night very different from tho&s;e to which &s;he had been accu&s;tomed. No &s;ooner was &s;he fallen into a &s;leep, than a thou&s;and vague but di&s;tre&s;&s;ing ideas darted acro&s;s her imagi|nation.&mdash;Her heart would at times whi&s;per to her as &s;he was half a&s;leep, "Lord Frederick is ba|ni&s;hed from you for ever."&mdash;She &s;hakes off the unea&s;ine&s;s this idea brings along with it&mdash;&s;he then &s;tarts, and beholds the blow &s;till aimed at him by Dorriforth.&mdash;And no &s;ooner has &s;he driven away this painful image, than &s;he is again awakened by &s;eeing her guardian at her feet &s;uing for pardon.&mdash;She &s;ighs, &s;he trembles, &s;he is chilled with terror.</P>
<P>Relieved by a flood of tears; towards the morn|ing &s;he &s;inks into a refre&s;hing &s;lumber, but waking, finds the &s;elf-&s;ame-images crowding altogether upon her mind&mdash;&s;he is doubtful to which to give the prefer|ence&mdash;one, however, ru&s;hes the foremo&s;t, and will continue &s;o&mdash;&s;he knows not the con&s;equence of ruminating, nor why &s;he dwells upon that more than upon all the re&s;t, and yet it will give place to none.</P>
<P>She ri&s;es in a languid and di&s;ordered &s;tate, and at breakfa&s;t adds fre&s;h pain to Dorriforth by her altered appearance.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="025650_0070_0FCEB14C38466328">
He had &s;carce left the breakfa&s;t room when an officer waited upon him charged with a challenge from Lord Frederick. To the me&s;&s;age delivered to him by this gentleman, Dorriforth replied,</P>
<P>"As a clergyman, more e&s;pecially in the church of Rome, I know not whether I am not exempt from an&s;wering a claim of this kind; but not hav|ing had forbearance to avoid an offence, I have no right to a privilege that would only indemnify me from making reparation."</P>
<P>"You will then meet his lord&s;hip, Sir, at the appointed time?" &s;aid the officer.</P>
<P>"I will," an&s;wered Dorriforth, "and my im|mediate care &s;hall be to procure a gentleman to ac|company me."</P>
<P>The officer withdrew, and as &s;oon as Dorriforth was once more alone, he was going once more to re|flect, but he dur&s;t not&mdash;&s;ince ye&s;terday, reflection, for the fir&s;t time of his life, was become painful to him; and even as he rode the &s;hort way to Lord Elmwood's immediately after, he found his own thoughts &s;o in&s;ufferable, he was obliged to enter into conver&s;ation with his &s;ervant. Solitude, that he was formerly &s;o charmed withal, at tho&s;e mo|ments had been wor&s;e than death.</P>
<P>At Lord Elmwood's, he met Sandford in the hall, and the &s;ight of him was no longer welcome, but di&s;plea&s;ing&mdash;he knew how different the principles he had ju&s;t adopted were to tho&s;e of that reverend friend's, and without his complaining, or even &s;u&s;|pecting what had happened, his pre&s;ence was a &s;ufficient reproach. Dorriforth pa&s;&s;ed him as ha&s;tily as he could, and inquiring for Lord Elm|wood, di&s;clo&s;ed to him his errand, which was to a&s;k him to be his &s;econd; his lord&s;hip &s;tarted, and and wi&s;hed to con&s;ult his tutor, but that his kin&s;|man &s;trictly forbid; and having urged his rea&s;ons
<PB N="63" REF="025650_0071_0FCEB180C745CD18">
with arguments, &s;uch as his lord&s;hip could not re|fute, he at length prevailed upon him to promi&s;e he would accompany him to the field, which was at a few miles di&s;tance only, and the parties were to be there at &s;even on the &s;ame evening.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as his bu&s;ine&s;s with Lord Elmwood was &s;ettled, Dorriforth returned home, to make &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary preparations for the event which might en&s;ue from this meeting&mdash;he wrote letters to &s;eve|ral of his friends; and one to his ward, over which he &s;hed tears.</P>
<P>Sandford going into Lord Elmwood's library &s;oon after Dorriforth had left it, expre&s;&s;ed his &s;urpri&s;e at finding him gone; upon which that young no|bleman, after an&s;wering a few que&s;tions, and giving a few &s;ignificant tokens, that he was intru&s;ted with a &s;ecret, frankly confe&s;&s;ed what he had promi&s;ed to conceal.</P>
<P>Sandford, as much as a holy man could be, was enraged at Dorriforth for the cau&s;e of this chal|lenge, but was &s;till more enraged at him for his wickedne&s;s in accepting it&mdash;he applauded his pu|pil's virtue in making the di&s;covery, and congratu|lated him&s;elf that he &s;hould be the in&s;trument of &s;aving not only the blood of his friend, but of preventing the &s;candal of his being engaged in a duel.</P>
<P>In the ardour of his de&s;igns he went immediately to Mi&s;s Milner's&mdash;entered the hou&s;e he had &s;o long, refu&s;ed to enter, and at a time when he was on ag|gravated bad terms with its owner.</P>
<P>He a&s;ked for Dorriforth, went ha&s;tily into his apartment, and poured upon him a torrent of re|bukes.&mdash;Dorriforth bore all he &s;aid with the pati|ence of a devotee, but with the firmne&s;s of a man.&mdash;He owned his fault, but no eloquence could make him recall the promi&s;e he had given to re|pair
<PB N="69" REF="025650_0072_0FCEB14E457771D0">
the injury.&mdash;Un&s;haken by the arguments, per|&s;ua&s;ions, and menaces of Sandford, he gave a fre&s;h proof of that inflexibility for which he has been de&s;cribed and after two hours di&s;pute they parted, neither of them the better for what either had advanced, but Dorriforth &s;omething the wor&s;e; his con&s;cience gave te&s;timony to Sandford's opinion, "that he was bound by ties more &s;acred than wordly honour," but while he owned, he would not yield to the duty.</P>
<P>Sandford left him, determined, however, that Lord Elmwood &s;hould not be acce&s;&s;ary in his guilt, and this he declared; on which Dorriforth took the re&s;olution of &s;eeking another &s;econd.</P>
<P>In pa&s;&s;ing through the hou&s;e on his return home, Sandford met, by accident, Mrs Horton, Mi&s;s Mil|ner, and the other two ladies returning from a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ter in the garden.&mdash;Surpri&s;ed at the &s;ight of Mr. Sandford in her hou&s;e, Mi&s;s Milner would not expre&s;s that &s;urpri&s;e, but going up to him with all the friendly benevolence which generally played about her heart, &s;he took hold of one of his hands, and pre&s;&s;ed it with a kindne&s;s which told him he was welcome more forcibly, than if &s;he had made the mo&s;t elaborate &s;peech to convince him of it.&mdash;He, however, &s;eemed little touched with her be|haviour, and as an excu&s;e for breaking his word, cried,</P>
<P>"I beg your pardon, Madam, but I was brought hither in my anxiety to prevent murder."</P>
<P>"Murder!" exclaimed all the ladies.</P>
<P>"Yes," an&s;wered he, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Mi&s;s Fenton, "your betrothed hu&s;band is a party con|cerned; he is going to &s;econd Mr. Dorriforth, who means this very evening to be killed by my Lord Frederick, or to kill him, in addition to the blow he gave him la&s;t night."</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="025650_0073_0FCEB1844600F4F0">
Mrs. Horton exclaimed, "If Mr. Dorriforth dies, he dies a martyr."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley cried with fervour, "Heaven for|bid!"</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Fenton cried, "Dear me!"</P>
<P>While Mi&s;s Milner, without uttering one word, &s;unk &s;peechle&s;s on the floor.</P>
<P>They lifted her up and brought her to the door which entered the garden. She &s;oon recovered; for the tumult of her mind would not &s;uffer her to remain inactive, and &s;he was rouzed, in &s;pite of her weakne&s;s, to endeavour to ward off the pre&s;ent di&s;a&s;ter. In vain, however, &s;he tried to walk to Dorriforth's apartment&mdash;in the trial &s;he &s;unk as before, and was taken to a &s;ettee, while Mi&s;s Woodley was di&s;patched to bring her guardian to her.</P>
<P>Informed of the cau&s;e of her &s;woonings, he fol|lowed Mi&s;s Woodley with a tender anxiety for her health, and with grief and confu&s;ion that he had &s;o carele&s;sly endangered it.&mdash;On his entering the room, Sandford beheld the inquietude of his mind, and cried, "Here is your <HI>guardian,</HI>" with a cruel empha&s;is on the word.</P>
<P>He was too much engaged by the indi&s;po&s;ition of his ward to reply to Sandford.&mdash;He placed him|&s;elf on the &s;ettee by her, and with the utmo&s;t ten|derne&s;s, reverence, and pity, entreated her not to be concerned at an accident in which he, and he only, had been to blame; but which he had &s;till no doubt would be accommodated in the mo&s;t ami|cable manner.</P>
<P>"I have one favour to require of you, Mr. Dor|riforth," &s;aid &s;he "and that is your promi&s;e, your &s;olemn promi&s;e, which I know is &s;acred, that you will not fight with my Lord Frederick."</P>
<P>He he&s;itated.</P>

"Oh, madam," cried Sandford, "he is grown a libertine now, and I would not believe his word were he to give it you."</P>
<P>"Then, Sir," returned Dorriforth angrily, "you <HI>may</HI> believe my word, for I will keep that, I have pa&s;&s;ed to you.&mdash;I will give Lord Frederick all the re&s;titution in my power.&mdash;But, my dear Mi&s;s Milner, let not this alarm you; we may not find it convenient to meet this many a day; and mo&s;t probably &s;ome fortunate explanation may yet take place, and prevent our meeting at all.

<P>"For my part," returned Dorriforth, "I look upon my life as much forfeited to his lord&s;hip, to whom I have given a high offence, as it might in other in&s;tances have been forfeited to the offended laws of the land. Honour is the law of the polite part of the land; we know it; and when we tran&s;|gre&s;s again&s;t it knowingly, we ju&s;tly incur our pu|ni&s;hment.&mdash;However, Mi&s;s Milner, this bu&s;ine&s;s is not to be &s;ettled immediately, and I have no doubt but all will be as you could wi&s;h&mdash;Do you think I &s;hould appear thus ea&s;y," added he with a &s;mile, "if I were going to be &s;hot at by my Lord Frederick?"</P>

<P>"You will &s;tay within then, all this day?" &s;aid Mi&s;s Milner.</P>

<P>"You knelt to me la&s;t night, I now kneel to you," &s;he cried; "kneel, never de&s;iring to ri&s;e more, if you per&s;i&s;t in your intention&mdash;I am weak, I am volatile, I am indi&s;creet, but I have a heart from whence &s;ome impre&s;&s;ions can never be e|ra&s;ed."</P>
<P>He endeavoured to rai&s;e her, &s;he per&s;i&s;ted to kneel&mdash;and here the trouble, the affright, the terror &s;he endured, di&s;covered to her for the fir&s;t time her own &s;entiments&mdash;which, till that moment, &s;he had doubted and &s;he continued,</P>
<P>"I no longer pretend to conceal my pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;I love Lord Frederick Lawnly."</P>
<P>Her guardian &s;tarted.</P>
<P>"Yes, to my &s;hame I love him:" (cried &s;he, all emotion) "I meant to have &s;truggled with the weakne&s;s, becau&s;e I &s;uppo&s;ed it would he di&s;plea&s;ing to you&mdash;but apprehen&s;ion for his &s;afety takes away every power of re&s;traint, and I be&s;eech you to &s;pare his life."</P>

<P>"I own," &s;aid Dorriforth, (&s;truck with amaze, and now taking her from his feet with a force &s;he could not re&s;i&s;t) "I own, Mi&s;s Milner, I am greatly affected at this contradiction in your charac|ter."&mdash;</P>

<P>He was proceeding with the mo&s;t poignant lan|guage, and au&s;tere looks, when ob&s;erving the &s;hame, the terror, and the &s;elf-reproach which agitated her mind, he dive&s;ted him&s;elf in great mea&s;ure of his au&s;terity, and &s;aid, mildly,</P>

<P>THIS taunting reproof from Sandford made little impre&s;&s;ion upon Mi&s;s Milner, who&s;e thoughts were all fixed on a &s;ubject of much more importance than the opinion he entertained of her.&mdash;She threw her arms about Mi&s;s Woodley as &s;oon as they were left alone, and a&s;ked with anxiety, "What &s;he thought of her behaviour?" Mi&s;s Woodley, who could not approve of the duplicity her friend had betrayed, &s;till wi&s;hed to reconcile her as much as po&s;&s;ible to her own conduct, and replied, &s;he "highly commended the frankne&s;s with which &s;he had, at la&s;t, acknowledged her &s;entiments."</P>
<P>"Frankne&s;s!" cried Mi&s;s Milner, &s;tarting.</P>
<P>"Frankne&s;s, my dear Mi&s;s Woodley!&mdash;what you have ju&s;t now heard me &s;ay, is all a fal&s;ehood."</P>
<P>"How, Mi&s;s Milner!"</P>
<P>"Oh, my dear Mi&s;s Woodley," returned &s;he, &s;obbing upon her bo&s;om, "pity the agonies of my heart, by nature &s;incere, when &s;uch are the fatal propen&s;ities it cheri&s;hes; I mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the gro&s;&s;e&s;t fal&s;ehoods rather than reveal the truth."</P>
<P>"What do you mean?" cried Mi&s;s Woodley, with the &s;tronge&s;t amazement painted on her face.</P>
<P>"Do you &s;uppo&s;e I love Lord Frederick? re|turned the other. "Do you &s;uppo&s;e I <HI>can</HI> love him?&mdash;Oh fly, Mi&s;s Woodley, and prevent my guardian from telling him &s;uch an untruth.</P>
<P>"What do you mean?" repeated Mi&s;s Woodley;
<PB N="75" REF="025650_0078_0FCEB15262D93038">
"I prote&s;t you frighten me:"&mdash;and this incon|&s;i&s;tency in the behaviour of Mi&s;s Milner really ap|peared as if her &s;en&s;es had been deranged.</P>
<P>"Only fly," re&s;umed &s;he, "and prevent the in|evitable ill con&s;equence which mu&s;t en&s;ue from Lord Frederick's being told this fal&s;ehood. It will in|volve us all in greater di&s;quietude than we &s;uffer at pre&s;ent."</P>
<P>"Then what has influenced you, my dear Mi&s;s Milner?"&mdash;</P>
<P>"That which impels my every action," returned &s;he; "an un&s;urmountable in&s;tinct&mdash;a fatality, that will ever render me the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of human beings; and yet you, even you, my dear Mi&s;s Woodley, will not pity me."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley pre&s;&s;ed her clo&s;e in her arms, and vowed, "That while &s;he was unhappy, from whate|ver cau&s;e, &s;he &s;till would pity her."</P>
<P>"Go to Mr. Dorriforth then, and prevent him from impo&s;ing upon Lord Frederick."</P>
<P>"But that impo&s;ition is the only means to pre|vent the duel," replied Mi&s;s Woodley. "The mo|ment I have told him you have no regard for his lord&s;hip, he will no longer refu&s;e to fight with him."</P>
<P>"Then at all events I am undone," exclaimed Mi&s;s Milner, "for the duel is horrible, even beyond every thing el&s;e."</P>
<P>"How &s;o?" returned Mi&s;s Woodley, &s;ince you have declared you do not care for my Lord Frede|rick."</P>
<P>"But are you &s;o blind," returned Mi&s;s Milner, with a degree of madne&s;s in her looks, "to believe I do not care for Mr. Dorriforth? Oh, Mi&s;s Woodley! I love him with all the pa&s;&s;ion of a mi&s;tre&s;s, and with all the tenderne&s;s of a wife."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley at this &s;entence &s;at down&mdash;it was
<PB N="76" REF="025650_0079_0FCE9F02D3981918">
on a chair that was clo&s;e to her&mdash;her feet could not have taken her to any other.&mdash;She trembled&mdash;&s;he was white as a&s;hes, and deprived of &s;peech. Mi&s;s Milner, taking her by the hand, &s;aid,</P>
<P>"I know what you feel&mdash;I know what you think of me&mdash;and how much you hate and de&s;pi&s;e me.&mdash;But Heaven is witne&s;s to all my &s;truggles&mdash;nor would I, even to my&s;elf, acknowledge the &s;hame|le&s;s prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, till forced by a &s;en&s;e of his dan|ger"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Silence," cried Mi&s;s Woodley, &s;truck with horror.</P>
<P>"And even now," re&s;umed Mi&s;s Milner, "have I not concealed it from all but you, by plunging my&s;elf into a new difficulty, from whence I know not how I &s;hall be extricated?&mdash;And do I entertain a hope? No, Mi&s;s Woodley, nor ever will&mdash;But &s;uffer me to own my folly to you&mdash;to entreat your &s;oothing friend&s;hip to free me from my weak|ne&s;s.&mdash;And, oh! give me your friendly advice to deliver me from the difficulties which &s;urround me."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley was &s;till pale, and &s;till &s;ilent.</P>
<P>Education is called &s;econd nature; in the &s;trict (but not enlarged) education of Mi&s;s Woodley, it was more powerful than the fir&s;t&mdash;and the violation of oaths, per&s;ons, or things con&s;ecrated to Heaven, was, in her opinion, if not in the mo&s;t enormous, the mo&s;t horrid among the catalogue of crimes.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner had lived too long in a family who had imbibed tho&s;e opinions not to be convinced of their exi&s;tence; nay, her own rea&s;on told her that &s;olemn vows of whatever kind, ought to be bind|ing; and the more &s;he re&s;pected her guardian's un|der&s;tanding, the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s &s;he called in que&s;tion his reli|gious tenets&mdash;in e&s;teeming him, &s;he e&s;teemed all his notions; and among the re&s;t, even venerated
<PB N="77" REF="025650_0080_0FCEB153BAEE0B58">
tho&s;e of his religion.&mdash;Yet that pa&s;&s;ion, which had unhappily taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her whole &s;oul, would not have been in&s;pired, had there not &s;ub&s;i&s;ted an early difference, in their &s;y&s;tems of divine faith&mdash;had &s;he been early taught what were the &s;acred functions of a Roman eccle&s;ia&s;tic, though all her e&s;teem, all her admiration, had been attracted by the qualities and accompli&s;hments of her guardian; yet education would have given &s;uch a prohibition to her love, that &s;he had been precluded from it, as by that barrier which divides a &s;i&s;ter from a bro|ther.</P>
<P>This unfortunately, was not the ca&s;e; and Mi&s;s Milner loved Dorriforth without one con&s;cious check to tell her &s;he was wrong, except that which convinced her, her love would be avoided by him, with dete&s;tation, with horror.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley, &s;omething recovered from her fir&s;t &s;urpri&s;e, and &s;uffering&mdash;for never did her &s;u&s;|ceptible mind &s;uffer &s;o exqui&s;itely&mdash;amid&s;t all the grief and abhorrence &s;he felt, pity was &s;till predo|minant&mdash;and reconciled to the faults of Mi&s;s Mil|ner by her mi&s;ery, &s;he once more looked at her with friend&s;hip, and a&s;ked, "what &s;he could do, to render her le&s;s unhappy?"</P>
<P>"Make me forget," replied Mi&s;s Milner, "every moment of my pa&s;t life &s;ince I fir&s;t &s;aw you&mdash;that moment was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eeming with a weight of cares I mu&s;t labour under till my death."</P>
<P>"And even in death," replied Mi&s;s Woodley, "do not be &s;o pre&s;umptuous as to hope to &s;hake them off&mdash;if unrepented in this world"&mdash;</P>
<P>She was proceeding&mdash;but the anxiety her friend endured, would not &s;uffer her to be wholly free from the apprehen&s;ion, that notwith&s;tanding the po&s;itive a&s;&s;urance of her guardian, (&s;hould he and Lord Frederick meet) the duel might &s;till take

place; &s;he therefore rung the bell and inquired if Mr. Dorriforth was &s;till at home?&mdash;the an&s;wer was&mdash;"He is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ode out."&mdash;"You remember," &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley, "he told you he &s;hould dine out." This did not, however, di&s;mi&s;s her fears, and &s;he di&s;patched two &s;ervants different ways in pur&s;uit of him, acquainting them with her &s;u&s;picions, and charging them to prevent his and Lord Frederick's meeting. Sandford had al&s;o taken his precautions; but though he knew the time, he did not know the exact place of their appointment, for that, Lord Elmwood had forgot to inquire.</P>
<P>The exce&s;&s;ive alarm which Mi&s;s Milner di&s;covered upon this occa&s;ion, was imputed by the &s;ervants, and others who were witne&s;&s;es of it, to her affection for Lord Edward, while none but Mi&s;s Woodley knew, or had the mo&s;t di&s;tant &s;u&s;picion of the real cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Mrs. Horton and Mi&s;s Fenton, who were &s;itting together expatiating on the duplicity of their own &s;ex in the in&s;tance ju&s;t before them, had, notwith|&s;tanding the intere&s;t of the di&s;cour&s;e, a longing de&s;ire to break it off; for they were impatient to &s;ee this poor frail being whom they were loading with their innocent&mdash;as it was among friends&mdash;calumny. They longed to &s;ee if &s;he would have the confidence to look them in the face: they, to whom &s;he had &s;o often prote&s;ted, &s;he had not the &s;malle&s;t attachment to Lord Frederick but from mo|tives of vanity.</P>
<P>The&s;e ladies heard with much &s;atisfaction dinner was &s;erved, but met Mi&s;s Milner at table with a le&s;s degree of plea&s;ure than they expected; for her Bath was &s;o totally ab&s;tracted from them, they could not di&s;cern a &s;ingle blu&s;h, or confu&s;ed glance, which their pre&s;ence occa&s;ioned. No, Mi&s;s Milner had before them divulged nothing of which &s;he
<PB N="79" REF="025650_0082_0FCEB1553733AB08">
was a&s;hamed, &s;he only was a&s;hamed what &s;he had &s;aid was not truth. In the bo&s;om of Mi&s;s Wood|ley alone was that &s;ecret entru&s;ted which could call a blu&s;h into her face, and before her &s;he <HI>did</HI> feel confu&s;ion&mdash;before the gentle friend, to whom &s;he had till this time communicated all her faults with|out embarra&s;&s;ment, &s;he now ca&s;t down her eyes in &s;hame, and &s;carce dur&s;t lift them up to meet her's.</P>
<P>At table there was little talking, and le&s;s eating; Mi&s;s Milner did not attempt to eat; Mi&s;s Woodley endeavoured, but could not.</P>
<P>Soon after the dinner was removed, Lord Elm|wood entered; and that gallant nobleman declared&mdash;"Mr. Sandford had u&s;ed him ill in not permit|ting him to accompany his relation; for he feared Dorriforth would now throw him&s;elf upon the &s;word of Lord Frederick without a friend by to defend him."&mdash;A rebuke from the eye of Mi&s;s Woodley, which from this day forward had a com|mand over Mi&s;s Milner, re&s;trained her from ex|pre&s;&s;ing the affright &s;he &s;uffered from this &s;uppo&s;i|tion of his lord&s;hip's. Mi&s;s Fenton replied, "As to that, my lord, I &s;ee no rea&s;on why Mr. Dorri|forth, and Lord Frederick &s;hould not now be friends.&mdash;"Certainly," &s;aid Mrs. Horton, "for as &s;oon as my Lord Frederick is made acquainted with Mi&s;s Milner's confe&s;&s;ion, all differences mu&s;t be re|conciled."&mdash;"What confe&s;&s;ion?" a&s;ked his lord|&s;hip.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner, to avoid hearing a repetition of that which gave her pain but to think of, aro&s;e in order to retire into her own apartment, but was obliged to &s;it down again&mdash;and received the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of her friend and Lord Elmwood to lead her into her dre&s;&s;ing-room. Reclined upon a &s;ofa there, a &s;i|lence en&s;ued between her and Mi&s;s Woodley for
<PB N="80" REF="025650_0083_0FCEB18CB4DFBC70">
near half an hour; and when the conver&s;ation began, the name of Dorriforth was never uttered&mdash;they were both grown cool and con&s;iderate &s;ince the di&s;covery, and both were equally a&s;hamed and fearful of naming him.</P>
<P>The vanity of the world, the folly of riches, the plea&s;ures of retirement, and &s;uch topics, en|gaged their di&s;cour&s;e, but not their thoughts, for near two hours; and the fir&s;t time the word Dor|riforth was &s;poken, a &s;ervant with alacrity opened the dre&s;&s;ing-room door, without previou&s;ly rapping, and cried, "Mr. Dorriforth, madam."</P>
<P>Dorriforth immediately came in, and went eagerly to Mi&s;s Milner.&mdash;Mi&s;s Woodley beheld the glow of joy, and guilt upon her face, and did not ri&s;e to give him her &s;eat, as was her cu&s;tom, if he came with intelligence to his ward, and &s;he was &s;itting next her&mdash;he therefore &s;tood while he re-repeated all that had happened in his interview with Lord Frederick.</P>
<P>But with her gladne&s;s to &s;ee her guardian &s;afe, Mi&s;s Milner had forgot to inquire for the &s;afety of his lord&s;hip; the man whom &s;he had pretended to love &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately&mdash;even a &s;mile of rapture was upon her face, though Dorriforth might be re|turned from putting him to death. This incon|gruity of behaviour Mi&s;s Woodley &s;aw, and was confounded&mdash;but Dorriforth, in who&s;e thoughts a &s;u&s;picion either of her love to him, or want of love for Lord Frederick, had not the &s;malle&s;t place, ea&s;ily reconciled this incon&s;i&s;tency, and &s;aid,</P>
<P>"You &s;ee by my countenance all is well, and therefore you &s;mile on me before I tell you what has pa&s;&s;ed."</P>
<P>This brought her to the recollection of her con|duct, and now with a countenance con&s;trained to &s;ome &s;how of gravity, &s;he tried to expre&s;s alarm &s;he did not feel.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="025650_0084_0FCEB156E5111ED8">
"Nay, I have the plea&s;ure to a&s;&s;ure you Lord Frederick is &s;afe," re&s;umed Dorriforth, "and the di&s;grace of his blow wa&s;hed entirely away, by a few drops of blood from this arm," and he laid his hand upon his left arm, which re&s;ted in his wai&s;tcoat as a &s;ling.</P>
<P>She ca&s;t her eyes there, and &s;eeing where the ball had entered the coat &s;leeve, &s;he gave an invo|luntary &s;cream, and &s;unk on the &s;ide of the &s;opha. In&s;tead of that tender &s;ympathy with which Mi&s;s Woodley u&s;ed to attend her upon the &s;lighte&s;t ill|ne&s;s or affliction, &s;he now addre&s;&s;ed her in a &s;harp tone, and cried, "Mi&s;s Milner, you have heard Lord Frederick is &s;afe, you have then nothing to alarm you."&mdash;Nor did &s;he run to offer a &s;melling-bottle, or to rai&s;e her head. Her guardian &s;eeing her near fainting, and without this a&s;&s;i&s;tance from her friend, was going him&s;elf to give it; but on this, Mi&s;s Woodley interfered, and having taken her head upon her arm, a&s;&s;ured him, "It was a trifling weakne&s;s to which Mi&s;s Milner was ac|cu&s;tomed, and that &s;he would ring for her woman, who knew how to relieve her in&s;tantly with a few drops."&mdash;Satisfied with this, Dorriforth left the room; and a &s;urgeon being arrived to dre&s;s his wound, he retired into his own chamber.</P>

<P>THE power delegated to the keeper of &s;e|crets, Mi&s;s Woodley was the la&s;t per&s;on on earth to abu&s;e&mdash;but &s;he was al&s;o the la&s;t, who, by her complacency, would participate in the guilt of her
<PB N="82" REF="025650_0085_0FCEB1912F514BE8">
friend&mdash;and there was no guilt, except that of mur|der, which &s;he thought equal to the crime in que&s;tion, provided it was ever perpetrated.&mdash;Adul|tery, her rea&s;on would perhaps have informed her, was a more pernicious evil to &s;ociety; but to a re|ligious mind, what &s;ounds &s;o terrible as &s;acrilege? Of vows made to God or to man, the former mu&s;t weigh the heavier.&mdash;Moreover, the dreadful &s;in of infidelity in the marriage &s;tate, is much &s;oftened to a common under&s;tanding, by the frequency of the crime; whereas, of vows broken by a devotee &s;he had &s;carce heard of any; or if any, they were generally followed by &s;uch examples of divine ven|geance, &s;uch miraculous puni&s;hments in this world, (as well as eternal puni&s;hment in the other) that &s;erved to exaggerate their wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P>She, who could, and did pardon Mi&s;s Milner, was the per&s;on who &s;aw her pa&s;&s;ion in the &s;evere&s;t light, and re&s;olved to take every method&punc; however har&s;h, to root it from her heart&mdash;nor did &s;he fear &s;ucce&s;s, re&s;ting on the certain a&s;&s;urance, that how|ever deep her love was fixed, it would never be re|turned. Yet this confidence did not prevent her taking every precaution, le&s;t Dorriforth &s;hould come to the knowledge of it&mdash;&s;he would not have his compo&s;ed mind di&s;turbed with &s;uch a thought&mdash;his &s;tedfa&s;t principles &s;o much as &s;hook by the ima|gination&mdash;nor overwhelm him with tho&s;e &s;elf-re|proaches which his fatal attraction, unpremeditated as it was, would &s;till have drawn upon him.</P>
<P>With this plan of concealment, in which the na|tural mode&s;ty of Mi&s;s Milner acquie&s;ced, there was but one effort to make which that young lady was not prepared for; and that was an entire &s;epa|ration from her guardian.&mdash;She had, from the fir&s;t, cheri&s;hed her pa&s;&s;ion without the mo&s;t di&s;tant pro&s;pect of a return&mdash;&s;he was prepared to &s;ee Dor|riforth
<PB N="83" REF="025650_0086_0FCEB15A0364C258">
without ever &s;eeing him nearer to her than her guardian and friend, but not to &s;ee him at all&mdash;for that, &s;he was not prepared.</P>
<P>But Mi&s;s Woodley reflected upon the inevitable nece&s;&s;ity of this &s;tep before &s;he made the propo&s;al, and then made it with a firmne&s;s that might have done honour to the inflexibility of Dorriforth him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>During the few days that intervened between her open confe&s;&s;ion of love for Lord Frederick, and this propo&s;al, the mo&s;t intricate incoherence ap|peared to the whole family, in the character of Mi&s;s Milner&mdash;and in order to evade a marriage with his lord&s;hip, and to conceal, at the &s;ame time, the &s;hameful propen&s;ity which lurked in her brea&s;t, &s;he was once, even on the point of declaring a pa&s;&s;ion for Sir Edward A&s;hton.</P>
<P>In the duel which had taken place between Lord Frederick and Dorriforth, the latter had received his antagoni&s;t's fire, but po&s;itively refu&s;ed to return it; by which he had kept his promi&s;e not to en|danger his lord&s;hip's life, and had reconciled Sand|ford, in great mea&s;ure, to his behaviour&mdash;and Sandford now (his re&s;olution once broken) no longer refu&s;ed entering Mi&s;s Milner's hou&s;e, but came every time it was convenient, though he yet avoided its mi&s;tre&s;s as much as po&s;&s;ible; or &s;howed by every word and look, when &s;he was pre&s;ent, that &s;he was &s;till le&s;s in his favour than &s;he had ever been.</P>
<P>He vi&s;ited Dorriforth on the evening after his engagement with Lord Frederick, and again the next morning breakfa&s;ted with him in his own chamber; nor did Mi&s;s Milner &s;ee her guardian &s;ince his fir&s;t return from that engagement till the following noon. She inquired, however, of the &s;ervant how his ma&s;ter did, and was rejoiced to
<PB N="84" REF="025650_0087_0FCEB191F4A2D2B0">
hear his wound was but very &s;light&mdash;yet this in|quiry &s;he dur&s;t not make before Mi&s;s Woodley, but waited till &s;he was ab&s;ent.</P>
<P>When Dorriforth made his appearance the next day, it was evident he had thrown from his heart a load of cares; and though they had left a langour upon his face, there was content in his voice, his manners, in his every word and action.&mdash;Far from &s;eeming to retain any re&s;entment towards his ward, for the trouble and danger into which her impru|dence had led him, he appeared rather to pity her weakne&s;s, and to wi&s;h to &s;ooth the perturbation which the recollection of her own conduct had ob|viou&s;ly rai&s;ed in her mind&mdash;His endeavours were mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful&mdash;&s;he was &s;oothed every time he &s;poke to her; and had not the watchful eye of Mi&s;s Woodley &s;tood guard over her inclinations, &s;he had plainly evinced, &s;he was enraptured with the joy of &s;eeing him again him&s;elf, after the danger to which he had been expo&s;ed.</P>
<P>The&s;e emotions, which &s;he laboured to &s;ubdue, pa&s;&s;ed, however, the bounds of her ineffectual re&s;i&s;tance; when, at the time of retiring after din|ner, he &s;aid to her in a low voice, but &s;uch as it was meant the company &s;hould hear, "Do me the favour, Mi&s;s Milner, to call at my &s;tudy &s;ometime in the evening; I have to &s;peak to you upon bu&s;i|ne&s;s."</P>
<P>She an&s;wered, "I will, Sir," And her eyes &s;wam with delight in expectation of the inter|view</P>
<P>Let not the reader, neverthele&s;s, imagine, there was in that ardent expectation, one idea which the mo&s;t &s;potle&s;s mind, in love, might not have indulged without reproach.&mdash;Sincere love, (at lea&s;t among the delicate of the female &s;ex) is often gratified by that degree of enjoyment, or rather forbearance,
<PB N="85" REF="025650_0088_0FCEB15D088B3D98">
which would be torture in the pur&s;uit of any other pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;real, delicate, and re&s;trained love, like that of Mi&s;s Milner's, was indulged in the &s;ight of the object only; and having bounded her wi&s;hes by her hopes, the height of her happine&s;s was limited to a conver&s;ation in which no other but them&s;elves partook a part.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley was one who heard the appoint|ment, but the only one who conceived with what &s;en&s;ation it was received.</P>
<P>While the ladies remained in the &s;ame room with Dorriforth, Mi&s;s Milner thought of little, except of him&mdash;as &s;oon as they withdrew into another apartment, &s;he remembered Mi&s;s Woodley, and turning her head &s;uddenly, &s;aw Mi&s;s Woodley's face imprinted with &s;u&s;picion and di&s;plea&s;ure&mdash;this at fir&s;t was painful to her&mdash;but recollecting that in a couple of hours time &s;he was to meet her guar|dian alone&mdash;&s;peak to him, and hear him &s;peak to her&s;elf only&mdash;every other thought was ab&s;orbed in that one, and &s;he con&s;idered with indifference, the unea&s;ine&s;s, or the anger of her friend.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner, to do ju&s;tice to her heart, did not wi&s;h to beguile Dorriforth into the &s;nares of love.&mdash;Could any &s;upernatural power have endowed her with the means, and at the &s;ame time &s;hown to her the ills that mu&s;t ari&s;e from &s;uch an effect of her charms, &s;he had a&s;&s;uredly enough of virtue to have declined the conque&s;t; but without inquiring of her&s;elf what &s;he propo&s;ed? She never &s;aw him without previou&s;ly endeavouring to look more at|tractive than &s;he would have de&s;ired, in any other company.&mdash;And now, without li&s;tening to the thou|&s;and exhortations that were &s;peaking in every feature of Mi&s;s Woodley's face, &s;he flew to a look|ing-gla&s;s, to adju&s;t her dre&s;s in a manner that &s;he thought mo&s;t enchanting.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="025650_0089_0FCEB19377E7F748">
Time &s;tole away, and the time to go to her guardian arrived. In his pre&s;ence, un&s;upported by the pre&s;ence of a third per&s;on, every grace &s;he had practi&s;ed, every look &s;he had borrowed to &s;et off her charms were annihilated, and &s;he became a native beauty, with the artle&s;s arguments of rea|&s;on, only for her aid.&mdash;Awed  thus, by his power, from every thing but what &s;he really was, &s;he ne|ver was perhaps half &s;o bewitching as in tho&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, re&s;pectful, and embarra&s;&s;ed moments &s;he pa&s;&s;ed alone with him.&mdash;He caught at tho&s;e times her re&s;pect, her di&s;&s;idence, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ay, even her embar|ra&s;&s;ment; and never would one word of anger pa&s;s on either &s;ide.</P>
<P>On the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, he fir&s;t expre&s;&s;ed the highe&s;t &s;atisfaction that &s;he had, at length, reveal|ed to him the &s;tate of her mind.</P>
<P>"And taking every thing into con&s;ideration, Mi&s;s Milner," added he, "I rejoice that your &s;en|timents happen to be &s;uch as you have owned&mdash;for although my Lord Frederick is not the very man I could have wi&s;hed for your perfect happine&s;s, yet in the &s;tate of human perfection and human happine&s;s, you might have fixed your affections with m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ch le&s;s propriety; and yet, where my un|willingne&s;s to thwart your inclinations, might not have permitted me to contend with them."</P>
<P>Not a word of reply did this demand, or if it had, not a word could &s;he have given.</P>
<P>"And now, madam, the rea&s;on of my de&s;ire to &s;peak with you&mdash;is to know from your&s;elf, the means you think mo&s;t proper to pur&s;ue, in order to acquaint his lord&s;hip, that notwith&s;tanding this late repul&s;e, there are hopes of your partiality in his favour."</P>

<P>"Mr. Dorriforth, can you allow nothing to the moments of &s;urpri&s;e? and that pity, which the fate impending in&s;pired; and which might urge me to expre&s;s my&s;elf of Lord Frederick, in a man|ner my cooler thoughts will not warrant?"</P>
<P>"There was nothing in your expre&s;&s;ions, my dear Mi&s;s Milner, the lea&s;t equivocal&mdash;if you were off your guard, when you pleaded for Lord Frede|rick, as I believe you were, you &s;aid more &s;incere|ly what you thought; and no di&s;creet, or rather indi&s;creet retractions, can make me change my opinion."</P>
<P>"I am very &s;orry," &s;he replied, confu&s;ed, and trembling.</P>
<P>"Why &s;orry? Come, give me commi&s;&s;ion to reveal the&s;e &s;entiments.&mdash;I'll not be too hard upon you&mdash;a hint from me to his lord&s;hip will do&mdash;hope, is ever apt to interpret the &s;lighte&s;t words to its own u&s;e, and a lover's hope, is, beyond all others, &s;anguine."</P>

<P>"My father, Mr. Dorriforth, thought your protection &s;ufficient."</P>
<P>"But that protection was rather to direct your choice, than to be the cau&s;e of your not choo&s;ing at all&mdash;Give me leave to point out an ob&s;ervation which, perhaps, I have too frequently done before, but upon this occa&s;ion I mu&s;t intrude it once again&mdash;Mi&s;s Fenton is its object&mdash;her fortune is inferior to your's, her per&s;onal attractions le&s;s."&mdash;</P>

<P>"Mr. Dorriforth, you know my opinion of the lady," replied Sandford, "it has been formed ever &s;ince my fir&s;t acquaintance with her, and it &s;till remains the &s;ame."</P>
<P>"But in&s;truct me how I am to in&s;pire her with confidence;" returned Dorriforth, "how I am to impre&s;s her with that which is for her advan|tage?"</P>
<P>"You can work no miracles," replied Sandford, "you are not holy enough."</P>

"I wi&s;h &s;he may," replied Dorriforth, mildly, for he beheld the tears flowing down her face at the rough and &s;evere manner in which Sandford had &s;poken, and began to feel for her unea&s;i|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>"I beg pardon," cried Sandford, "for &s;peaking &s;o rudely to the mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e&mdash;I have no bu&s;ine&s;s here, I know; but where you are, Mr. Dorriforth, unle&s;s I am turned out, I &s;hall ever think it my duty to come."</P>

<P>"I was to blame, that on a nice punctilio, I left you &s;o long without my vi&s;its, and without my coun&s;el; in the time, you have run the hazard of being murdered, and what is wor&s;e, of being ex|communicated; for had you been &s;o ra&s;h as to have returned your opponent's fire, not all my intere&s;t at Rome would have obtained remi&s;&s;ion of the pu|ni&s;hment."</P>

<P>"To go and reveal to Mr. Dorriforth, without he&s;itation, the real &s;tate of your heart; which your pre&s;ent incon&s;i&s;tent conduct will but too readily confirm."</P>

<P>Mi&s;s Milner was to write to her di&s;tant relation at Bath, complaining of the melancholy of a coun|try life, which &s;he was to &s;ay her guardian impo&s;ed upon her, and entreat the lady to &s;end a pre&s;&s;ing invitation for her to pa&s;s a month or two with her; this invitation was to be &s;hown to Dorriforth for his approbation, and both Mi&s;s Woodley, and Mi&s;s Milner were to enforce it, by expre&s;&s;ing their earne&s;t wi&s;hes for his con&s;ent. This plan properly regulated, the nece&s;&s;ary letter was &s;ent by Mi&s;s Milner to Bath, and Mi&s;s Woodley waited with patience, but with a watchful guard upon the conduct of her friend till the an&s;wer arrived.</P>
<P>During this interval a mo&s;t tender and complain|ing epi&s;tle from Lord Frederick was delivered to Mi&s;s Milner; to which, as he received no an&s;wer, his lord&s;hip prevailed upon his uncle, with whom he re&s;ided, to wait upon her, and obtain her verbal reply; for he &s;till flattered him&s;elf, fear of her guardian's anger, or perhaps his interception of the letter he had &s;ent, was the cau&s;e of her &s;eeming contempt.</P>

The old gentleman was introduced to Mi&s;s Mil|ner, and after to Mr. Dorriforth, but received from each an an&s;wer &s;o explicit, that left his nephew no longer in doubt but all farther pur&s;uit was vain.</P>
<P>Sir Edward A&s;hton about this time al&s;o, &s;ubmit|ted to a formal di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, and had the mortifica|tion to reflect, he was be&s;towing upon the object of his affections the tendere&s;t proof of his regard, by ab&s;enting him&s;elf wholly from her &s;ociety.</P>

He con&s;equently became much more re&s;erved, and more au&s;tere than he had been, &s;ince his fir&s;t acquaintance with her; for his manners, not from de&s;ign, but unknowingly, were &s;oftened &s;ince his guardian&s;hip, by that tender re&s;pect he had never cea&s;ed to pay to the object of his pro|tection.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this &s;everity he a&s;&s;umed, his ward in the pro&s;pect of parting from him grew me|lancholy; Mi&s;s Woodley's love to her friend ren|dered her little otherwi&s;e; and Dorriforth's pecu|liar gravity, oftentimes rigour, could not but make the whole party much le&s;s cheerful than they had been. Lord Elmwood too was lying dangerou&s;ly ill of a fever; Mi&s;s Fenton of cour&s;e was as much in &s;orrow as her nature would &s;uffer her to be, and both Sandford and Dorriforth, in extreme concern on his lord&s;hip's account.</P>

In this &s;tate of affairs, the letter of invitation arrives from Lady Luneham at Bath: it was &s;hown to Dorriforth; and to prove to his ward he is &s;o much offended, as no longer to feel that exce&s;&s;ive intere&s;t in her concerns he once did, he gives his opinion on the &s;ubject with indifference&mdash;he de&s;ires "Mi&s;s Milner will do as &s;he her&s;elf thinks proper."&mdash;Mi&s;s Woodley in&s;tantly accepts this permi&s;&s;ion, writes back, and appoints the day her friend means to &s;et off for the vi&s;it.</P>

<P>WHEN Mi&s;s Milner arrived at Bath, &s;he thought it the mo&s;t altered place &s;he had ever &s;een&mdash;&s;he was mi&s;taken, it was &s;he her&s;elf, who was changed.</P>
<P>The walks were melancholy, the company in&s;i|pid, the ball-room fatiguing&mdash;in fine, &s;he had left behind all that could charm or plea&s;e her.</P>
<P>Though &s;he found her&s;elf far le&s;s happy than when &s;he was at Bath before, yet &s;he felt, &s;he would not, to enjoy all that pa&s;t happine&s;s, be again re|duced to the being &s;he was at that time. Thus, does the lover con&s;ider the extinction of his pa&s;&s;ion, with the &s;ame horror as the libertine looks upon annihilation; the one would rather live hereafter (though in all the tortures with which his future &s;tate is de&s;cribed) than cea&s;e to exi&s;t, &s;o there are no tortures a lover would not &s;uffer, rather than cea&s;e to love.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="025650_0102_0FCEB1C2C36A2D10">
In the wide pro&s;pect of melancholy before her, Mi&s;s Milner's fancy caught hold of the only com|fort which pre&s;ented it&s;elf; and this, &s;lender as it was, in the total ab&s;ence of every other, her ima|gination pictured as exce&s;&s;ive. The comfort was a letter from Mi&s;s Woodley&mdash;a letter wherein the &s;ubject of her love would mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly be men|tioned, and in whatever terms, mu&s;t &s;till be the means of delight.</P>
<P>A letter arrived&mdash;&s;he devoured it with her eyes.&mdash;The po&s;t-mark on the out&s;ide denoting from whence it came, the name of "Milner Lodge" written on the top, were all &s;ources of plea&s;ure&mdash;and &s;he read &s;lowly every line it contained to pro|cra&s;tinate the plea&s;ing expectation &s;he enjoyed, till &s;he &s;hould arrive at the name of Dorriforth. At la&s;t her impatient eye, caught the word three lines beyond the place &s;he was reading&mdash;irre&s;i&s;tibly, &s;he &s;kipped over tho&s;e lines, and fixed on the point to which &s;he was attracted.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley was cautious in her indulgence; &s;he made the &s;lighte&s;t mention of Dorriforth, &s;aying only, "He was extremely concerned, and even de|jected, at the little hope there was of his cou&s;in, Lord Elmwood's, recovery."&mdash;Short and trivia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> as this pa&s;&s;age was, it was &s;till more important to Mi&s;s Milner than any other in the letter&mdash;&s;he read it again and again, con&s;idered, and reflected upon it.&mdash;Dejected, thought &s;he, what does that word ex|actly mean?&mdash;did I ever &s;ee Mr. Dorriforth deject|ed?&mdash;how, I wonder, does he look in that &s;tate?&mdash;Thus did &s;he mu&s;e, while the cau&s;e of his dejec|tion, though a mo&s;t &s;erious one, and pathetically de&s;cribed by Mi&s;s Woodley, &s;carce arre&s;ted her at|tention once.&mdash;She run over with ha&s;te the account of Lord Elmwood's &s;tate of health; &s;he certainly pitied him while &s;he thought of him, but &s;he did

not think of him long. To die was a hard fate for a young nobleman ju&s;t in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his immen&s;e fortune, and on the eve of marriage with a beauti|ful young woman; but Mi&s;s Milner thought Heaven might &s;till be better than all this, and &s;he had no doubt but his lord&s;hip would go there. The forlorn &s;tate of Mi&s;s Fenton ought to have been a &s;ubject for compa&s;&s;ion, but &s;he knew that lady had re&s;ignation to bear any lot with patience, and that a trial of her fortitude might be more flattering to her vanity than to be Counte&s;s of Elmwood: in a word, &s;he &s;aw nobody's misfortunes equal to her own, becau&s;e &s;he &s;aw no one &s;o little able to bear misfortune.</P>
<P>She replied to Mi&s;s Woodley's letter, and dwelt very long on that &s;ubject which Mi&s;s Woodley had taken care to pa&s;s over lightly; this was another indulgence; and to hear from, and to write to her friend, were now the only enjoyments &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. From Bath Mi&s;s Milner paid &s;everal fe&s;tive vi&s;its with Lady Luneham&mdash;all were alike tedious and melancholy.</P>
<P>But her guardian wrote to her, and though the &s;ubject was &s;orrowful, the letter gave her joy&mdash;the &s;entiments it expre&s;&s;ed were but trite and common|place, yet &s;he valued them as the deare&s;t effu&s;ions of friend&s;hip and affection; and her hand trembled, and her heart beat with rapture while &s;he wrote the an&s;wer, tho' &s;he knew it would not be receiv|ed with one emotion, &s;uch as tho&s;e which &s;he ex|perienced. In her &s;econd letter to Mi&s;s Woodley &s;he prayed like a per&s;on in&s;ane to be taken home from confinement, and like a lunatic prote&s;ted, in &s;en&s;ible language, &s;he "had no di&s;order." But her friend replied, "that very declaration proves its vio|lence." And a&s;&s;ured her that nothing le&s;s than placing her affections el&s;ewhere, &s;hould induce her to believe, but that &s;he was incurable.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="025650_0104_0FCEB1C4621B3768">
Mi&s;s Woodley's third letter acquainted Mi&s;s Mil|ner with the death of Lord Elmwood&mdash;Mi&s;s Wood|ley was exceedingly affected by this event, and &s;aid lit|tle el&s;e on any other &s;ubject.&mdash;Mi&s;s Milner was &s;hock|ed when &s;he read the words "he is dead," and in&s;tantly thought, "How tran&s;ient are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ublunary things!&mdash;within a few years I &s;hall be dead&mdash;and how fe|licitous will it then be, if I have re&s;i&s;ted every temptation to the delu&s;ive plea&s;ures of this life!" The happine&s;s of a peaceful death occupied her contemplation for near an hour; but at length every virtuous and pious &s;entiment this meditation in&s;pired, &s;erved but to remind her of the many &s;enten|ces &s;he had heard fall from her guardian's lips upon the &s;ame &s;ubject&mdash;her thoughts were again fixed on him, and &s;he could think of nothing be&s;ide.</P>
<P>In a very &s;hort time after, her health became impaired from the indi&s;po&s;ition of her mind; &s;he langui&s;hed, and was once in imminent danger. During a &s;light delirium of her fever, Mi&s;s Wood|ley's name and her guardian's were repeated ince&s;|&s;antly; Lady Luneham &s;ent them immediate word of this, and they both ha&s;tened to Bath, and arriv|ed there, ju&s;t as her di&s;order had taken a mo&s;t fa|vourable turn. As &s;oon as &s;he became perfectly recollected, her fir&s;t care was, knowing the frailty of her heart, to inquire what &s;he had uttered while delirious.&mdash;Mi&s;s Woodley, who was by her bed|&s;ide, begged her not to be alarmed on that account, and a&s;&s;ured her &s;he knew, from all her attendants, that &s;he had only &s;poken with a friendly remem|brance (as was really the ca&s;e) of tho&s;e per&s;ons who were dear to her.</P>
<P>She wi&s;hed to know whether her guardian was come to &s;ee her, but &s;he had not the courage to a&s;k before Mi&s;s Woodley; and her friend was afraid, by the too &s;udden mention of his name, to di&s;com|po&s;e

Mi&s;s Milner a&s;ked inqui&s;itively "What &s;he &s;aid?" and the woman going to her, replied &s;oftly, "Lord Elmwood, madam, would wi&s;h to come and &s;ee you for a few moments, if you will allow him?" Mi&s;s Milner turned her head, and &s;tared wildly.</P>
<P>"I thought," &s;aid &s;he, "Lord Elmwood had been dead&mdash;are my &s;en&s;es di&s;ordered &s;till?"</P>
<P>"No, my dear," an&s;wered Mi&s;s Woodley, "it is the pre&s;ent Lord Elmwood who wi&s;hes to &s;ee you; he whom you left ill when you came hither is dead."</P>
<P>"And who is the pre&s;ent Lord Elmwood?" &s;he a&s;ked.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley after a &s;hort he&s;itation replied&mdash;"Your guardian."</P>
<P>"And &s;o he is," cried Mi&s;s Milner, "he is the next heir&mdash;I had forgot.&mdash;But is it po&s;&s;ible he is here?"</P>
<P>"Yes&mdash;" returned Mi&s;s Woodley with a grave voice and manner, to moderate that glow of &s;atis|faction which for a moment &s;parkled even in her languid eye, and blu&s;hed over her pallid counte|nance&mdash;"Yes&mdash;as he heard you were ill, he thought it right to come and &s;ee you."</P>
<P>"He is very good," an&s;wered &s;he, and the tears &s;tarted in her eyes.</P>
<P>"Would you plea&s;e to admit his lord&s;hip?" a&s;ked her woman.</P>
<P>"Not yet, not yet," &s;he replied, "let me re|collect my&s;elf fir&s;t." And &s;he looked with a timid doubt upon her friend, to a&s;k if it was pro|per.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley could &s;carce &s;upport this humble reference to her judgment from the wan face of the

poor invalid, and taking her by the hand, whi&s;|pered, in tears, "You &s;hall do what you plea&s;e."&mdash;In a few minutes Lord Elmwood was intro|duced.</P>
<P>To tho&s;e who &s;incerely love, every change of &s;ituation or circum&s;tances in the object beloved, ap|pears an advantage.&mdash;So, the acqui&s;ition of a title and e&s;tate, was in Mi&s;s Milner's eye an immea&s;ura|ble advantage to her guardian, not on the &s;core of their real value, but any change in&s;tead of dimini&s;h|ing her pa&s;&s;ion would have &s;erved but to increa&s;e it&mdash;even a change to the utmo&s;t poverty.</P>
<P>When he entered, the &s;ight of him &s;eemed to be too much for her, and after the fir&s;t glance &s;he turned her head away&mdash;the &s;ound of his voice en|couraged her, however, to look once more&mdash;and now &s;he rivetted her eyes upon him.</P>
<P>"It is impo&s;&s;ible, my dear Mi&s;s Milner," he gently whi&s;pered, "to &s;ay, the joy I feel that your di&s;order has &s;ub&s;ided."</P>
<P>But though it was impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay, it was po&s;&s;ible to <HI>look</HI> what he felt, and his looks expre&s;&s;ed his feelings.&mdash;In the zeal of tho&s;e &s;en&s;ations, he laid hold of her hand, and held it between his&mdash;this he him&s;elf did not know&mdash;but &s;he did.</P>

<P>They had only one more interview before he left the place; at which Mi&s;s Milner was capable of &s;itting up&mdash;he was with her, however, but a very &s;hort time, &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary concerns relative to the late Lord Elmwood's affairs, calling him in ha&s;te to London.

<P>WHEN the time for Mi&s;s Woodley to depart arrived, Mi&s;s Milner entreated earne&s;tly to accom|pany her home, and made the mo&s;t &s;olemn pro|mi&s;es that &s;he would guard not only her behaviour, but her very thoughts, within the limitation her friend &s;hould pre&s;cribe. Mi&s;s Woodley at length yielded thus much, "That as &s;oon as Lord Elm|wood was &s;et out on his journey to Italy, where &s;he

<P>With this conce&s;&s;ion on the &s;ide of Mi&s;s Wood|ley they parted; and as winter was now far ad|vanced, that lady returned to her aunt's hou&s;e in town, from whence Mrs. Horton was, however, preparing to remove, in order to &s;uperintend Lord Elmwood's hou&s;e, (which had been occupied by the late Earl,) in Gro&s;venor-&s;quare; and Mi&s;s Woodley was to accompany her.</P>
<P>If Lord Elmwood was not de&s;irous Mi&s;s Milner &s;hould conclude her vi&s;it and return to his protec|tion, it was partly from the multiplicity of affairs in which he was this time engaged, and partly from having Mr. Sandford now entirely placed with him as his chaplain; for he dreaded that living in the &s;ame hou&s;e their natural antipathy might be in|crea&s;ed to aver&s;ion&mdash;upon this account he once thought of advi&s;ing Mr. Sandford to take up his abode el&s;ewhere; but the great plea&s;ure his lord&s;hip took in his &s;ociety, joined to the great mortification he knew &s;uch a propo&s;al would be to his friend, would not &s;uffer him to make it.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner all this time was not thinking upon tho&s;e &s;he hated, but on tho&s;e &s;he loved.&mdash;Sand|ford never came into her thoughts, while the image of Lord Elmwood never left them.

<P>"Marry!" cried Sir Harry.</P>

<P>"How be married?" &s;aid Lady Luneham, "Has he not taken a vow never to marry?"</P>
<P>"Yes," an&s;wered Mr. Fleetmond, "but there are no religious vows, from which the great Pontiff of Rome cannot grant a di&s;pen&s;ation&mdash;tho&s;e com|mandments made by the church, the church has always the power to di&s;pen&s;e withal; and when it is for the general good of religion, his holine&s;s thinks it incumbent on him, to publi&s;h his bull to remit all pains and penalties for their non-ob&s;er|vance; and certainly it is for the honour of the catholics, that this earldom &s;hould continue in a catholic family&mdash;In &s;hort, I'll lay a wager my Lord Elmwood is married within the twelvemonth.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner, who li&s;tened with attention, feared &s;he was in a dream, or deceived by the pretended knowledge of Mr. Fleetmond, who might know nothing&mdash;but on con&s;ideration, all that he had &s;aid was very probable; and to confirm its truth, he was him&s;elf a Roman Catholic, and mu&s;t be well

informed on the &s;ubject upon which he &s;poke&mdash;If &s;he had heard the dire&s;t news that ever &s;ounded in the ears of the mo&s;t &s;u&s;ceptible of mortals, the agitation of her mind and per&s;on could not have been &s;tronger&mdash;&s;he felt, while every word was &s;peaking, a chill through all her veins&mdash;it was a plea&s;ure too exqui&s;ite, not to bear along with it the &s;en&s;ation of exqui&s;ite pain; of which &s;he was &s;o &s;en&s;ible, that for a few moments it cau&s;ed her to wi&s;h &s;he had not heard the intelligence though, very &s;oon after, &s;he would not but have heard it for the world.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;he had recovered from her fir&s;t a&s;to|ni&s;hment and joy, &s;he wrote to Mi&s;s Woodley an exact account of what &s;he had heard, and received this an&s;wer:</P>
<Q><P>I am &s;orry any body &s;hould have given you this piece of information, becau&s;e it was a ta&s;k, in the executing of which, I had promi&s;ed my|&s;elf the mo&s;t extreme &s;atisfaction&mdash;but the fear your health was not &s;ufficiently returned to &s;up|port, without danger, the burthen of hopes which I knew would, upon this occa&s;ion, pre&s;s upon you, I deferred my plea&s;ing communication, and I have had it anticipated. Yet, as you &s;eem in the utmo&s;t doubt as to the truth of what you have been told, perhaps this confirmation of it, may fall little &s;hort of the fir&s;t news; e&s;pecially when it is &s;trengthened by my entreating you to come to us, as &s;oon as you can with propriety leave Lady Luneham.</P>
<P>Come, my dear Mi&s;s Milner, and find in your once rigid monitor, a faithful confident&mdash;I will no longer threaten to di&s;clo&s;e a &s;ecret you have tru&s;ted me with, but leave it to the wi&s;dom and &s;en&s;ibility of his heart, (who is now to penetrate into the hearts of our &s;ex, in &s;earch of one con|&s;onant

<P>This letter was another of tho&s;e excruciating plea&s;ures, that nearly reduced Mi&s;s Milner to the grave&mdash;it took away from her all appetite to food, and from her eyes the power of being clo&s;ed &s;o &s;e|veral nights&mdash;&s;he thought &s;o much upon the pro&s;|pect of accompli&s;hing her wi&s;hes, that &s;he could think of nothing be&s;ide; not even invent a proba|ble excu&s;e for leaving Lady Luneham, before the appointed time, which was yet two months to come. She wrote to Mi&s;s Woodley to beg her contrivance, to reproach her for keeping the &s;ecret &s;o long from her, and to thank her for having revealed it to her in &s;o kind a manner at la&s;t&mdash;She begged al&s;o to be acquainted how Mr. Dorriforth (for &s;till &s;he called him by that name) &s;poke and thought of this &s;ud|den change in his de&s;tiny.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley's reply was a &s;ummons for her to town upon &s;ome pretended bu&s;ine&s;s, which &s;he a|voided explaining, but which entirely &s;ilenced her lady&s;hip's entreaties for her &s;tay.</P>
<P>To her que&s;tion concerning Lord Elmwood &s;he an&s;wered, "It is a &s;ubject on which he &s;eldom &s;peaks&mdash;he appears ju&s;t the &s;ame he ever did, nor could you by any part of his conduct, conceive that any &s;uch change had taken place." Mi&s;s Mil|ner exclaimed to her&s;elf "I am glad he is not al|tered&mdash;if his words, looks, or manners were any thing different from what they formerly were, I &s;hould not like him &s;o well." And ju&s;t the rever&s;e would have been the ca&s;e, had Mi&s;s Woodley &s;ent her word he was changed. The day for her leaving <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> was fixed; &s;he expected it with rapture, but before its arrival &s;unk under the care of expectation;

and when it came, was &s;o much indi&s;po&s;ed as to be forced to defer her journey for a week.</P>
<P>At length &s;he found her&s;elf in London&mdash;in the hou&s;e of her guardian&mdash;and that guardian no longer bound to a &s;ingle life, but <HI>enjoined</HI> to marry. He appeared in her eyes, as in Mi&s;s Woodley's, the &s;ame as ever; or perhaps more endearing than ever, as it was the fir&s;t time &s;he had beheld him with hope.&mdash;Mr. Sandford did not appear the &s;ame; yet he was in reality as &s;urly and as di&s;re&s;pectful in his behaviour to her as u&s;ual; but &s;he did ob&s;erve, or &s;he did not feel his moro&s;e temper as heretofore&mdash;he &s;eem|ed amiable, mild, and gentle; at lea&s;t &s;uch was the happy medium through which &s;he &s;aw him now; for good humour, like the jaundice, makes every one of its own complexion.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XX.</HEAD>
<P>LORD ELMWOOD was preparing to go abroad to receive in form, the di&s;pen&s;ation from his vows; it was, however, a &s;ubject he &s;eemed carefully to avoid &s;peaking upon; and when by any accident he was obliged to mention it, it was without any marks either of &s;atisfaction or concern.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner's pride, for the fir&s;t time, began to take the alarm&mdash;while he was Mr. Dorriforth, and confined him&s;elf to a &s;ingle life, his indifference to her charms was rather an honourable, than a re|proachful trait in his character, and in reality &s;he admired him for the in&s;en&s;ibility&mdash;but on the eve of being at liberty, and on the eve of making his choice, &s;he was offended that choice was not imme|diately fixed upon her&mdash;She had been accu&s;tomed
<PB N="110" REF="025650_0113_0FCE9F1D09054BB0">
to receive the devotion of every man who &s;aw her, and not to obtain it of the man from whom, of all others, &s;he mo&s;t wi&s;hed it, was cruelly humili|ating.&mdash;She complained to Mi&s;s Woodley, who advi&s;ed her to have patience, but that was one of the virtues in which &s;he was the lea&s;t practi&s;ed.</P>
<P>Encouraged, neverthele&s;s, by her friend in the commendable de&s;ire of gaining the affections of him, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all her's; &s;he, however, left no means unattempted to make the conque&s;t&mdash;but &s;he began with too great certainty of &s;ucce&s;s, not to be &s;en&s;ible of the deepe&s;t mortification in the di&s;appointment&mdash;nay, &s;he anticipated a di&s;appoint|ment, as &s;he had before anticipated her &s;ucce&s;s, and by turns felt the keene&s;t emotions from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and from de&s;pair.</P>
<P>As the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions alternately governed her, &s;he was alternately in &s;pirits or dejected; in good or in ill humour; and the frequent vici&s;&s;itudes of her pro&s;pects, at length gave to her behaviour an air of capriciou&s;ne&s;s, which not all her follies had till now produced.&mdash;This was not the way to obtain the af|fections of Lord Elmwood; &s;he knew it was not; and before him &s;he was under &s;ome re&s;triction.&mdash;Sandford ob&s;erved this, and added to her many other failings, hypocri&s;y. It was plain to &s;ee Mr. Sandford e&s;teemed her le&s;s and le&s;s every day; and as he was the per&s;on who mo&s;t of all influenced the opinion of her guardian, he became to her, very &s;oon, an object not merely of di&s;like, but of ab|horrence.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;entiments for each other, were di&s;cover|able in every word and action while they were in each other's company; but &s;till in his ab&s;ence, Mi&s;s Milner's good nature, and little malice, never &s;uffered her to utter a &s;entence injurious to his in|tere&s;t.&mdash;Sandford's charity did not extend thus far;

and &s;peaking of her with &s;everity one evening while &s;he was at the opera, "His meaning," as he &s;aid, "was but to caution her guardian again&s;t her faults." Lord Elmwood replied,</P>
<P>"There is one fault, however, Mr. Sandford, I cannot lay to her charge."</P>
<P>"And what is that, my lord?" (cried Sandford eagerly) "What is that one fault, which Mi&s;s Mil|ner has not?"</P>
<P>"I never," replied his lord&s;hip, "heard Mi&s;s Milner, in your ab&s;ence, utter a &s;yllable to your di&s;advantage."</P>
<P>"She dur&s;t not, my lord, becau&s;e &s;he is in fear of you; and &s;he knows you would not &s;uf|fer it."</P>
<P>"She then," an&s;wered his lord&s;hip, "pays me a much higher compliment than you do; for you freely cen&s;ure her, and yet imagine I will &s;uffer it."</P>
<P>"My lord," replied Sandford, "I am un|deceived now, and &s;hall never take that liberty a|gain."</P>
<P>As his lord&s;hip always treated Sandford with the utmo&s;t re&s;pect, he began to fear he had been defi|cient upon this occa&s;ion; and the di&s;po&s;ition which had induced him to take his ward's part, was likely, in the end, to prove unfavourable to her; for per|ceiving Sandford was offended at what had pa&s;&s;ed, as the only means of retribution, his lord&s;hip began him&s;elf to lament her volatile and captious propen|&s;ities; in which lamentation Sandford, now for|getting his affront, joined with the heartie&s;t con|currence, adding,</P>
<P>"That you, Sir, having now other cares to em|ploy your thoughts, ought to in&s;i&s;t upon her mar|rying, or her retiring wholly into the country."</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="025650_0115_0FCEB19E2FEEB8B0">
She returned home ju&s;t as this conver&s;ation was fini&s;hed, and Sandford the moment &s;he entered, rung for his candle to retire. Mi&s;s Woodley, who had been at the opera with Mi&s;s Milner, cried,</P>
<P>"Ble&s;s me, Mr. Sandford, are you not well; you are going to leave us &s;o early?"</P>
<P>He replied, "No, I have a pain in my head."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner, who never heard complaints with|out &s;ympathy, ro&s;e immediately from her &s;eat, &s;aying,</P>
<P>"I think I never heard you, Mr. Sandford, com|plain of indi&s;po&s;ition before&mdash;will you accept of my &s;pecific for the head-ach? indeed it is a certain relief&mdash;I'll fetch it in&s;tantly."</P>
<P>She went ha&s;tily out of the room, and returned with a bottle, which, &s;he a&s;&s;ured him, "was a pre|&s;ent from Lady Luneham, and would certainly cure him."&mdash;And &s;he pre&s;&s;ed it upon him with &s;uch an anxious earne&s;tne&s;s, that with all his churli&s;hne&s;s he could not refu&s;e taking it.</P>
<P>This was but a common-place civility, &s;uch as is paid by one enemy to another every day; but the <HI>manner</HI> was the material part&mdash;the unaffected con|cern, the attention, the good will, &s;he demon&s;trated in this little incident, was that which was remarka|ble; and which immediately took from Lord Elm|wood the di&s;plea&s;ure to which he had been ju&s;t be|fore excited, or rather transformed it into a degree of admiration. Even Sandford was not in&s;en&s;ible to her behaviour, and in return, when he left the room, "wi&s;hed her a good night."</P>
<P>To her and to Mi&s;s Woodley, who had not been witne&s;&s;es of the preceding conver&s;ation, what &s;he had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> appeared of no merit, but to the mind of Lord Elmwood it had much; and upon the depar|ture of Sandford he began to be unu&s;ually cheerful. He fir&s;t, reproached the ladies for not offering him a place in their box at the opera.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="025650_0116_0FCEB1D036827F90">
"Would you have gone, my lord?" a&s;ked Mi&s;s Milner, highly delighted.</P>
<P>"Certainly," returned he, "had you invited me."</P>
<P>"Then from this day, my lord, I give you a ge|neral invitation: nor &s;hall any other company be admitted, but what you approve."</P>
<P>"I am very much obliged to you," an&s;wered his lord&s;hip.</P>
<P>"And you," continued &s;he, "who have been only accu&s;tomed to church-mu&s;ick, will be more than any one, enchanted on hearing the &s;oft, har|monious &s;ounds of love."</P>
<P>"What ravi&s;hing plea&s;ures are you preparing for me!" returned he, "I know not whether my weak &s;en&s;es will be able to &s;upport them."</P>
<P>She had her eyes upon him as he &s;poke this, and di&s;covered in his, which were fixed upon her, a &s;en&s;ibility unexpected&mdash;a kind of fa&s;cination, which enticed her to look on, while her eye-lids fell in|voluntarily before its mighty force; and a thou&s;and blu&s;hes crowded over her face.&mdash;He was &s;truck with the&s;e &s;udden &s;ignals; ha&s;tily recalled his for|mer countenance, and &s;topt the conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley, who had been a &s;ilent ob&s;erver for &s;ome time, now thought a word or two from her, would be acceptable rather than trouble|&s;ome.</P>
<P>"And pray, my lord," &s;aid &s;he, when do you go to France?"</P>
<P>"To Italy, you mean,"&mdash;&s;aid he, "not at all&mdash;my &s;uperiors are very indulgent, for they di&s;pen&s;e with all my duties.&mdash;I ought, and meant, to have gone abroad; but as a variety of concerns require my pre&s;ence in England, every nece&s;&s;ary ceremony has taken place here."</P>
<P>"Then your lord&s;hip is no longer in orders?" &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="025650_0117_0FCEB19F75601BB8">
"No, they have been re&s;igned the&s;e five days."</P>
<P>"My lord, I give you joy," &s;aid Mi&s;s Milner.</P>
<P>He thanked her, but added with a &s;igh, "If I have given up content in &s;earch of joy, I &s;hall probably be a lo&s;er by the venture.&mdash;Soon after this, he wi&s;h|ed the ladies good night, and retired.</P>
<P>Happy as Mi&s;s Milner found her&s;elf in his com|pany, &s;he &s;aw him leave the room with infinite &s;a|tisfaction, becau&s;e her heart was impatient to give a loo&s;e to its hopes on the bo&s;om of Mi&s;s Woodley.&mdash;She bad Mrs. Horton immediately good night, and in her friend's apartment gave way to all the language of the tendere&s;t pa&s;&s;ion, warm with the confidence of meeting its return.&mdash;She de&s;cribed the &s;entiments &s;he had read in Lord Elmwood's looks, and though Mi&s;s Woodley had beheld them too, Mi&s;s Milner's fancy heightened every glance; and her con&s;truction became, by degrees, &s;o ex|tremely favourable to her own wi&s;hes, that had not her friend been pre&s;ent and known in what mea|&s;ure to e&s;timate tho&s;e &s;ymptoms; &s;he mu&s;t infalli|bly have thought by the joy to which they gave birth, his lord&s;hip had openly avowed pa&s;&s;ion for her.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley, therefore, thought it her duty to allay tho&s;e extacies, and repre&s;ented to her, &s;he might be deceived in her hopes&mdash;or even &s;uppo&s;ing his lord&s;hip's inclinations tended towards her, there were yet great ob&s;tacles between them.&mdash;"Would Sandford, who governed, or at lea&s;t directed his almo&s;t every thought and purpo&s;e, not to be con|&s;ulted upon this? and if he was, on what, but the mo&s;t romantic affection on the part of Lord Elm|wood, had Mi&s;s Milner to depend? and his lord|&s;hip was not a man to be &s;u&s;pected of &s;ubmitting to the exce&s;s of any pa&s;&s;ion." Thus did Mi&s;s Woodley argue, for fear her friend &s;hould be mi&s;led by her wi&s;hes, yet in her own mind &s;he &s;carce har|boured
<PB N="115" REF="025650_0118_0FCEB1D1B4140418">
a doubt that any thing would thwart them.&mdash;The &s;ucceeding circum&s;tance proved &s;he was mi&s;|taken.</P>
<P>Another gentleman of family and fortune made overtures to Mi&s;s Milner; and her guardian, &s;o far from having his thoughts inclined towards her on his own account, pleaded this lover's cau&s;e even with more zeal, than he had formerly pleaded for Sir Edward and Lord Frederick; and thus at once de|&s;troyed all tho&s;e plans of happine&s;s poor Mi&s;s Mil|ner had meditated.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence, her melancholy humour was now predominant; and for &s;everal days &s;he &s;taid entirely at home, and yet was denied to all her vi|&s;itants.&mdash;Whether this aro&s;e from pure melan|choly, or the &s;till lingering hope of making her conque&s;t, by that &s;edatene&s;s of manners &s;he knew her guardian admired, perhaps &s;he her&s;elf did not know.&mdash;Be that as it may, Lord Elmwood could not but ob&s;erve this change, and one morning thought fit to mention, and applaud it.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley and &s;he were working together when he came into the room; and after &s;itting &s;e|veral minutes, and talking upon indifferent &s;ubjects; to which his ward replied with a dejection in her voice and manner&mdash;he &s;aid,</P>
<P>"Perhaps I am wrong, Mi&s;s Milner, but I have ob&s;erved you are lately grown more thoughtful than u&s;ual."</P>
<P>She blu&s;hed, as &s;he always did when the &s;ubject was her&s;elf.&mdash;He continued, "Your health ap|pears perfectly re&s;tored, and yet you do not take de|light in your former recreations."</P>
<P>"Are you &s;orry for that, my lord?"</P>
<P>"No madam, I am extremely glad; and I was going to congratulate you upon the change&mdash;but give me leave to inquire, to what lucky accident we are to attribute this alteration?"</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="025650_0119_0FCEB1A300CA31B8">
"Your lord&s;hip then thinks all my commenda|ble deeds, ari&s;e from accident; and that I have no virtues of my own."</P>
<P>"Pardon me, Mi&s;s Milner, I think you have many." This he &s;poke emphatically; and the blood flowed to her face more than at fir&s;t.</P>
<P>He re&s;umed&mdash;"How can I doubt of a lady's vir|tues, when her countenance gives &s;uch evident proofs of them?&mdash;believe me, Mi&s;s Milner, that in the mid&s;t of your gaye&s;t follies; while you thus continue to blu&s;h, I &s;hall reverence your internal &s;en&s;ations."</P>
<P>"Oh! my lord, did you know &s;ome of them, I am afraid you would think them unpardonable."</P>
<P>This was &s;o much to the purpo&s;e, Mi&s;s Woodley found her&s;elf unea&s;y&mdash;but &s;he needed not&mdash;Mi&s;s Milner loved too &s;incerely, to reveal it to the object.&mdash;His lord&s;hip an&s;wered,</P>
<P>"And did you, Mi&s;s Milner, know &s;ome of mine, you might think them equally unpardonable."</P>
<P>She turned pale, and could no longer guide her needle&mdash;in the fond tran&s;ports of her heart &s;he imagined, the &s;en&s;ations to which he alluded, was his love for her.&mdash;She was too much embarra&s;&s;ed to reply, and he continued,</P>
<P>"We have all a great deal to pardon in one a|nother; and I know not whether the officious per|&s;on who forces, even his good advice, is not as blameable as the ob&s;tinate one, who will not li&s;ten to it.&mdash;And now, having made a preface to excu&s;e you, &s;hould you once more refu&s;e mine, I will ven|ture to give it."</P>
<P>"My lord," returned &s;he, "I have never yet refu&s;ed to follow your advice, but where my own peace of mind was &s;o nearly concerned, as to have made me culpable, had I complied."</P>
<P>"Well, madam, I &s;ubmit to your determinati|ons;

and &s;hall never again oppo&s;e your inclination to remain &s;ingle."</P>
<P>This &s;entence, as it excluded his ever &s;oliciting for him&s;elf, gave her the utmo&s;t pain; and &s;he ca&s;t a glance of her eye at him full of reproach.&mdash;He did not ob&s;erve it, but went on.</P>
<P>"Continuing unmarried, it &s;eems to have been your father's intention, you &s;hould continue under my immediate care; but as I mean for the future to re&s;ide chiefly in the country, an&s;wer me can|didly, do you think you could be happy there, for at lea&s;t three parts of the year?"</P>
<P>After a &s;hort he&s;itation, &s;he replied&mdash;"I have no objection."</P>
<P>"I am glad to hear it, he returned eagerly, for it is my earne&s;t de&s;ire to have you with me&mdash;your welfare is dear to me as my own; and were we apart, continual apprehen&s;ions would prey upon my mind."</P>
<P>The tear &s;tarted in her eye, at the earne&s;tne&s;s with which this was &s;poken;&mdash;he &s;aw it, and to &s;often it &s;till more with the &s;en&s;e of his e&s;teem for her, he increa&s;ed his earne&s;tne&s;s, while he &s;aid,</P>
<P>"If you will take the re&s;olution to quit London for the time I mention, there &s;hall be no means un|employed to make the country all you can wi&s;h&mdash;I &s;hall in&s;i&s;t upon Mi&s;s Woodley's accompanying you; and it will not only be <HI>my</HI> &s;tudy to form &s;uch a &s;ociety as you may approve, but I am certain it will be likewi&s;e the &s;tudy of Lady Elmwood&mdash;"</P>
<P>He was going on, but as if a poignard had thru&s;t her heart, &s;he writhed under this unexpected &s;troke.</P>
<P>He &s;aw her countenance change&mdash;he looked at her &s;tedfa&s;tly.</P>
<P>It was not a common change from joy to &s;orrow, from content to unea&s;ine&s;s, which Mi&s;s Milner di&s;|covered&mdash;&s;he felt, and &s;he expre&s;&s;ed angui&s;h.&mdash;

Lord Elmwood was alarmed and &s;hocked.&mdash;She did not weep, but &s;he called Mi&s;s Woodley to come to her, with a voice that indicated a degree of agony.</P>

<P>He was totally ignorant what &s;he meant, nor had he lei&s;ure from the confu&s;ion of his thoughts to reflect upon her meaning; he neverthele&s;s replied, with warmth, "Do&mdash;you will find I'll perform it.&mdash;Do&mdash;I will faithfully perform it."</P>
<P>Though Mi&s;s Milner was con&s;cious this declara|tion could not, in delicacy, ever be brought again&s;t him; yet the fervent and &s;olemn manner in which he made it, cheered her &s;pirits; and as per&s;ons en|joy the reflection of having in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;ome valuable gem, although they are determined never to u&s;e it, &s;o &s;he upon this, was comforted and grew better.&mdash;She now lifted up her head from Mi&s;s Woodley, and leaned it on her hand as &s;he &s;at by

the &s;ide of a table&mdash;&s;till &s;he did not &s;peak, but &s;eemed overcome with &s;orrow.&mdash;As her &s;ituation became, however, le&s;s alarming; her guardian's pity and affright began to take the colour of re|&s;entment; and though he did not &s;ay &s;o, he was, and looked highly offended.</P>
<P>At this juncture Mr. Sandford entered.&mdash;On be|holding the pre&s;ent party, it needed not his &s;aga|city to &s;ee, at the fir&s;t view, they were all unea&s;y; but in&s;tead of the &s;ympathy this might have ex|cited in &s;ome di&s;po&s;itions, Mr. Sandford, after ca&s;ting a look at each of them, appeared in high &s;pirits.</P>
<P>"You &s;eem unhappy, my lord," &s;aid he, with a &s;mile.</P>
<P>"You do <HI>not</HI>&mdash;Mr. Sandford," replied his lord|&s;hip.</P>
<P>"No, my lord, nor would I, were I in your &s;itu|ation,"&mdash;returned he. "What &s;hould make a man of &s;en&s;e out of temper but a worthy object?"&mdash;And he looked at Mi&s;s Milner.</P>
<P>"There are no objects unworthy our care," re|plied Lord Elmwood.</P>
<P>"But there are objects on whom all care is fruit|le&s;s, your lord&s;hip will allow."</P>
<P>"I never yet de&s;paired of any one, Mr. Sand|ford."</P>
<P>"And yet there are per&s;ons, of whom it is pre|&s;umption, to entertain hopes."&mdash;And he looked a|gain at Mi&s;s Milner.</P>
<P>"Does your head ach, Mi&s;s Milner?" A&s;ked Mi&s;s Woodley, &s;eeing her hold it with her hand.</P>
<P>"Very much," returned &s;he.</P>
<P>"Mr. Sandford," &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley, "Did you u&s;e all tho&s;e drops Mi&s;s Milner gave you for a pain in the head?"</P>
<P>"Yes," an&s;wered he, "I did."&mdash;But the que&s;tion at that moment &s;omewhat embarra&s;&s;ed him.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="025650_0123_0FCEB1A575BCA720">
"And I hope you found benefit from them," &s;aid Mi&s;s Milner, with great kindne&s;s, as &s;he ro&s;e from her &s;eat, and walked &s;lowly and de&s;pondently out of the room.</P>
<P>Though Mi&s;s Woodley followed her, &s;o that Mr. Sandford was left alone with Lord Elmwood, and might have continued his unkind in&s;inuations with|out one re&s;traint; yet his lips were clo&s;ed for the pre&s;ent.&mdash;He looked down on the carpet&mdash;twitched him&s;elf upon his chair&mdash;and began to talk of the weather.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXI.</HEAD>
<P>AS &s;oon as the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of de&s;pair was over, Mi&s;s Milner &s;uffered her&s;elf to be once more in hope&mdash;&s;he found there were no other means to &s;upport her life; and to her no &s;mall joy, her friend Mi&s;s Woodley was much le&s;s &s;evere on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion than &s;he expected&mdash;No engagement be|tween mortals, was, in Mi&s;s Woodley's opinion, binding like that entered into with heaven; and whatever vows Lord Elmwood had made to another, &s;he ju&s;tly &s;uppo&s;ed, no woman's love for him equalled Mi&s;s Milner's&mdash;it was prior to all others too, and that e&s;tabli&s;hed a claim, at lea&s;t to contend for &s;ucce&s;s; and in a contention, what rival would not fall before her?</P>
<P>It was not difficult to gue&s;s who this rival was; or if they were a little time in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, Mi&s;s Wood|ley &s;oon arrived at the certainty, by inquiring of Mr. Sandford; who, un&s;u&s;picious why &s;he a&s;ked, readily informed her the intended Lady Elmwood, was no other than Mi&s;s Fenton; and that her mar|riage
<PB N="121" REF="025650_0124_0FCEB1D7B962B838">
with his lord&s;hip would be &s;olemnized as &s;oon as the mourning for the late Lord Elmwood was expired.&mdash;This la&s;t intelligence made Mi&s;s Wood|ley &s;hudder&mdash;however, &s;he repeated it to Mi&s;s Mil|ner, word for word.</P>
<P>Happy! happy, woman!" exclaimed Mi&s;s Milner of Mi&s;s Fenton; "&s;he has received the fir&s;t fond impul&s;es of his heart, and has had the tran&s;cendent happine&s;s of teaching him to love!</P>
<P>"By no means," returned Mi&s;s Woodley, finding there was no other method to comfort her; "do not &s;uppo&s;e Lord Elmwood's marriage is the re&s;ult of love&mdash;it is no more than a duty, a nece&s;&s;ary piece of bu&s;ine&s;s, and this you may plainly &s;ee by the wife on whom he has fixed.&mdash;Mi&s;s Fenton was thought a proper match for his cou&s;in, and this &s;ame propriety, you mu&s;t perceive, &s;till exi&s;ts."</P>
<P>It was ea&s;y to convince Mi&s;s Milner all her friend &s;aid was truth, for &s;he wi&s;hed it to be &s;o. "And oh!" &s;he exclaimed, "could I but &s;timulate pa&s;&s;ion, in the place of propriety&mdash;do you think my dear Mi&s;s Woodley," (and &s;he looked with &s;uch begging eyes, it was impo&s;&s;ible not to an&s;wer as &s;he wi&s;hed,) "do you think it would be unju&s;t to Mi&s;s Fenton, were I to in&s;pire her de&s;tined hu&s;band with a pa&s;&s;ion which &s;he may not have in&s;pired; and which I believe &s;he her&s;elf cannot feel?"</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley pau&s;ed a minute, and then an|&s;wered, "No;"&mdash;but there was a he&s;itation in her manner of delivery&mdash;&s;he did &s;ay, "No," but &s;he looked as if &s;he was afraid &s;he ought to have &s;aid "Yes."&mdash;Mi&s;s Milner, however, did not wait to give her time to recall the word, or to alter its meaning by adding others to it, but run on eagerly, and declared, "As that was her opinion, &s;he would abide by it, and do all &s;he could to &s;upplant her rival."&mdash;In order, never|thele&s;s, to ju&s;tify this determination, and &s;atisfy
<PB N="122" REF="025650_0125_0FCEB1A6F55F1600">
the con&s;cience of Mi&s;s Woodley, they both con|cluded, Mi&s;s Fenton's heart was not engaged in the intended marriage, and con&s;equently &s;he was indif|ferent whether it took place or not.</P>
<P>Since the death of the late earl, that young lady had not been in town; nor had the pre&s;ent lord been near the &s;pot where &s;he re&s;ided &s;ince the week her lover died; of cour&s;e, nothing like love could be declared at &s;o early a period; and if it had been made known &s;ince, it mu&s;t only have been by let|ter, or by the deputation of Mr. Sandford, whom they knew had once been in the country to vi&s;it her; but how little he was qualified to enforce a tender pa&s;&s;ion, was a comfortable reflection.</P>
<P>Revived with the&s;e conjectures, of which &s;ome were true, and others fal&s;e; the very next day a dark gloom over&s;pread their bright pro&s;pects, on Mr. Sandford's &s;aying as he entered the breakfa&s;t-room,</P>
<P>"Mi&s;s Fenton, ladies, de&s;ired me to pre&s;ent her compliments to you."</P>
<P>"Is &s;he in town?" a&s;ked Mrs. Horton.</P>
<P>"She came to town ye&s;terday morning," re|turned Sandford, "and is at her brother's, in Or|mond-&s;treet; my lord and I &s;upped there la&s;t night, and that made us &s;o late home."</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip entered &s;oon after, and confirmed what had been &s;aid, by bowing to his ward, and telling her, "Mi&s;s Fenton had charged him with her kinde&s;t re&s;pects."</P>
<P>"How does poor Mi&s;s Fenton look?" Mrs. Hor|ton a&s;ked Lord Elmwood.</P>
<P>To which que&s;tion Sandford replied, "Beautiful&mdash;&s;he looks beautifully."</P>
<P>"She has got over her unea&s;ine&s;s, I &s;uppo&s;e then?" &s;aid Mrs. Horton&mdash;not knowing &s;he was a&s;king the que&s;tion before her new lover.</P>
<P>Unea&s;y!" replied Sandford, "unea&s;y at any trial
<PB N="123" REF="025650_0126_0FCEB1DA84F637C8">
this world can &s;end? that had been highly unwor|thy of her."</P>
<P>"But &s;ometimes women do fret at &s;uch things," replied Mrs. Horton innocently.</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood a&s;ked Mi&s;s Milner&mdash;"If &s;he meant to ride, this charming day?"</P>
<P>While &s;he was he&s;itating&mdash;</P>
<P>"There are very different kind of women," (an&s;wered Sandford, directing his di&s;cour&s;e to Mrs. Horton,) "there is as much difference between &s;ome women, as between good and evil &s;pirits."</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood a&s;ked Mi&s;s Milner again&mdash;"if &s;he took an airing?"</P>
<P>She replied, "No."</P>
<P>"And beauty," continued Sandford, "when endowed upon &s;pirits that are evil, is a mark of their greater, their more extreme wickedne&s;s.&mdash;Lucifer was the mo&s;t beautiful of all the angels in paradi&s;e&mdash;"</P>
<P>"How do you know?" &s;aid Mi&s;s Milner.</P>
<P>"But the beauty of Lucifer," (continued Sand|ford, in perfect neglect and contempt of her que&s;|tion,) "was an aggravation of his guilt; becau&s;e it &s;howed a double &s;hare of ingratitude to the Di|vine Creator of that beauty."</P>
<P>"Now you talk of angels," &s;aid Mi&s;s Milner, "I wi&s;h I had wings; and I &s;hould like to fly through the park this morning."</P>
<P>"You would be taken for an angel in good ear|ne&s;t," &s;aid Lord Elmwood.</P>
<P>Sandford was angry at this little compliment, and cried, "Then in&s;tead of the wings, I would advi&s;e the &s;erpent's &s;kin."</P>
<P>"My lord," cried &s;he, "does not Mr. Sandford u&s;e me ill?"&mdash;Vext with other things, &s;he felt her|&s;elf extremely hurt at this, and made the appeal almo&s;t in tears.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="025650_0127_0FCEB1A9D3412B30">
"Indeed, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> he does," an&s;wered his lord|&s;hip, and he looked at Sandford as if he was di&s;|plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>This was a triumph &s;o agreeable to her, &s;he im|mediately pardoned the offence; but the offender did not &s;o ea&s;ily pardon her.</P>
<P>"Good morning, ladies," &s;aid his lord&s;hip, ri|&s;ing to go away.</P>
<P>"My lord," &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley, "you promi&s;ed Mi&s;s Milner to accompany her one evening to the opera; this is opera night."</P>
<P>"Will you go, my lord?" a&s;ked Mi&s;s Milner, in a voice &s;o &s;oft, he &s;eemed as if he wi&s;hed, but could not re&s;i&s;t it.</P>
<P>"I am to dine at Mr. Fenton's to-day," he re|plied, "and if he and his &s;i&s;ter will go; and you will allow them part of your box, I will promi&s;e to come."</P>
<P>This was a condition that did not plea&s;e her, but as &s;he felt a &s;trong de&s;ire to &s;ee him in the company of his intended bride, (for &s;he fancied &s;he could perceive his mo&s;t &s;ecret &s;entiments, could &s;he once &s;ee them together) &s;he an&s;wered not ungraciou&s;ly, "Yes, my compliments to Mr. and Mi&s;s Fenton, and I hope they will favour me with their com|pany."</P>
<P>"Then, madam, if they come, you may expect me&mdash;el&s;e not." And he bowed and left the room.</P>
<P>All the day was pa&s;&s;ed in anxious expectation by Mi&s;s Milner, what would be the event of the even|ing; for upon the &s;kill of her penetration that evening, all her future pro&s;pects &s;he thought de|pended.&mdash;If &s;he &s;aw by his looks, his words, or a&s;&s;iduity, he loved Mi&s;s Fenton, &s;he flattered her|&s;elf &s;he would never think of him again with hope; but if &s;he ob&s;erved him treat her with inattention or indifference, &s;he meant to cheri&s;h from that mo|ment the fonde&s;t expectations.&mdash;Again&s;t that &s;hort
<PB N="125" REF="025650_0128_0FCEB1DC035B7F40">
evening her toilet was con&s;ulted the whole day; and the alternate hope and fear which fluttered at her heart, gave a more than u&s;ual brilliancy to her eyes, and more than u&s;ual bloom to her com|plexion.&mdash;But in vain was her beauty; vain all the pains &s;he had taken to decorate that beauty; vain the many looks &s;he ca&s;t towards her box-door to &s;ee it open; Lord Elmwood did not come.</P>
<P>The mu&s;ic was di&s;cord&mdash;every thing &s;he &s;aw, was di&s;gu&s;ting&mdash;in a word, &s;he was mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>She longed impatiently for the curtain to drop, becau&s;e &s;he was unea&s;y where &s;he was&mdash;yet &s;he a&s;ked her&s;elf, "Shall I be le&s;s unhappy at home? yes, at home I &s;hall &s;ee Lord Elmwood, and that will be happine&s;s&mdash;but he will behold me with neglect, and that will be mi&s;ery.&mdash;Ungrateful man! I will no longer think of him."&mdash;She &s;aid to her&s;elf.&mdash;Or could &s;he have thought of him without joining in the &s;ame idea Mi&s;s Fenton, her angui&s;h had been &s;upportable; but while &s;he pictured them as lovers, the tortures of the rack give but a few degrees more pain than &s;he endured.</P>
<P>There are but few per&s;ons who ever felt the real pa&s;&s;ion of jealou&s;y, becau&s;e few have felt the real pa&s;&s;ion of love; but to tho&s;e who have experienced them both, jealou&s;y not only affects the mind, but every fibre of the frame is a victim to it; and Mi&s;s Milner's every limb ached, with agonizing tor|ment, while Mi&s;s Fenton, courted and beloved by Lord Elmwood, was pre&s;ent to her imagination.</P>
<P>The moment the opera was fini&s;hed, &s;he flew ha&s;tily down &s;tairs, as if to fly from the &s;ufferings &s;he experienced.&mdash;She did not go into the coffee-room, though repeatedly per&s;uaded by Mi&s;s Wood|ley, but waited at the door till her carriage drew up.</P>
<P>Piqued&mdash;heart-broken&mdash;full of re&s;entment to the object of her unea&s;ine&s;s; as &s;he &s;tood inattentive

to all that pa&s;&s;ed, a hand gently laid hold of her's, and the mo&s;t humble and in&s;inuating voice &s;aid, will you permit me to hand you to your carriage?" She was awaked from her reverie, and found Lord Frederick Lawnly by her &s;ide.&mdash;Her heart, ju&s;t then melting with tenderne&s;s to another, was perhaps more acce&s;&s;ible than heretofore, or bur&s;ting with re&s;entment, thought this the moment to retaliate. Whatever pa&s;&s;ion reigned that in&s;tant, it was fa|vourable to the de&s;ires of Lord Frederick, and &s;he looked as if &s;he was glad to &s;ee him; he beheld this with the rapture and the humility of a lover; and though &s;he did not feel the &s;lighte&s;t love in re|turn, &s;he felt a gratitude proportionate to the in|&s;en&s;ibility with which &s;he had been treated by her guardian, and Lord Frederick was not very erro|neous if he mi&s;took this gratitude for a latent &s;park of affection. The mi&s;take, however, did not force from him his re&s;pect: he handed her to her car|riage, bowed lowly and di&s;appeared. Mi&s;s Wood|ley wi&s;hed to divert her thoughts from the object which could only make her wretched, and as they rode home, by many encomiums upon Lord Fre|derick, endeavoured to incite her to a regard for him; Mi&s;s Milner was di&s;plea&s;ed at the attempt, and exclaimed,</P>
<P>"What, love a rake, a man of profe&s;&s;ed gal|lantry? impo&s;&s;ible.&mdash;To me, a common rake is as odious, as a common pro&s;titute is to a man of the nice&s;t feelings.&mdash;Where can be the pride of in&s;pir|ing a pa&s;&s;ion, fifty others can equally in&s;pire? or the tran&s;port of be&s;towing favours, where the ap|petite is already cloyed by fruition of the &s;elf-&s;ame enjoyments?"</P>
<P>"Strange!" cried Mi&s;s Woodley, "that you who po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;o many follies incident to your &s;ex &s;hould, in the di&s;po&s;al of your heart, have &s;enti|ments &s;o contrary to women in general."</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="025650_0130_0FCEB1DCF9F52498">
"My dear Mi&s;s Woodley," returned &s;he, "put in competition the languid love of a debauchee, with the vivid affections of a &s;ober man, and judge which has the dominion? Oh! in my calendar of love, a &s;olemn lord chief ju&s;tice, or a devout arch|bi&s;hop, ranks before a licentious king."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley &s;miled at an opinion which &s;he knew half her &s;ex would laugh at; but by the air of &s;incerity with which it was delivered, &s;he was con|vinced, her late behaviour to Lord Frederick was but the mere effect of chance.</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood's carriage drove to his door ju&s;t at the time her's did; Mr. Sandford was with him, and they were both come from pa&s;&s;ing the evening at Mr. Fenton's.</P>
<P>"So, my lord," &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley, as &s;oon as they met in the apartment, "you did not come to us."</P>
<P>"No," an&s;wered his lord&s;hip, "I was &s;orry; but I hope you did not expect me."</P>
<P>"Not expect you, my lord?" cried Mi&s;s Milner, "did you not &s;ay you would come?"</P>
<P>"If I had, I certainly &s;hould have come," re|turned he, "but I only &s;aid &s;o conditionally."</P>
<P>"That I am witne&s;s to," cried Sandford, "for I was pre&s;ent at the time, and his lord&s;hip &s;aid it would depend upon Mi&s;s Fenton."</P>
<P>"And &s;he with her gloomy di&s;po&s;ition," &s;aid Mi&s;s Milner, "cho&s;e to &s;it at home."</P>
<P>"Gloomy di&s;po&s;ition?" repeated Sandford, "She is a young lady with a great &s;hare of &s;prightline&s;s&mdash;and I think I never &s;aw her in better &s;pirits than &s;he was this evening, my lord?"</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood did not &s;peak.</P>
<P>"Ble&s;s me, Mr. Sandford," cried Mi&s;s Milner, "I meant no reflection upon Mi&s;s Fenton's di&s;po|&s;ition; I only meant to cen&s;ure her ta&s;te for &s;taying at home."</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="025650_0131_0FCEB1AC47D802C8">
"I think," replied Sandford "a much greater cen&s;ure &s;hould be pa&s;&s;ed upon tho&s;e, who prefer rambling abroad."</P>
<P>"But I hope, ladies, my not coming," &s;aid his lord&s;hip, "was no cau&s;e of inconvenience to you; you had &s;till a gentleman with you, or I &s;hould cer|tainly have come."</P>
<P>"Oh! yes, two gentlemen," an&s;wered the young &s;on of Lady Evans, a lad from &s;chool, whom Mi&s;s Milner had taken along with her, and to whom his lord&s;hip had alluded.</P>
<P>"What two?" a&s;ked Lord Elmwood.</P>
<P>Neither Mi&s;s Milner or Mi&s;s Woodley an|&s;wered.</P>
<P>"You know, madam," &s;aid young Evans, "that hand&s;ome gentleman who handed you into your carriage, and you called my lord."</P>
<P>"Oh! he means Lord Frederick Lawnley," &s;aid Mi&s;s Milner carele&s;sly, but a blu&s;h of &s;hame &s;pread over her face.</P>
<P>"And did he hand you to your coach?" A&s;ked his lord&s;hip, earne&s;tly.</P>
<P>"By mere accident, my lord," Mi&s;s Woodley replied, "for the crowd was &s;o great&mdash;"</P>
<P>"I think, my lord," &s;aid Sandford, "it was very lucky you were <HI>not</HI> there."</P>
<P>"Had Lord Elmwood been with us, we &s;hould not have had occa&s;ion for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of any other." Said Mi&s;s Milner.</P>
<P>"Lord Elmwood has been with you, madam," returned Sandford, "very frequently, and yet&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Mr. Sandford," &s;aid his lord&s;hip, interrupting him, "it is near bed-time, your conver&s;ation keeps the ladies from retiring."</P>
<P>"Your lord&s;hip's does not," &s;aid Mi&s;s Milner, "for you &s;ay nothing."</P>
<P>"Becau&s;e, madam, I am afraid to offend."</P>
<P>"But does not your lord&s;hip al&s;o hope to plea&s;e?

and without ri&s;king the one, it is impo&s;&s;ible to ar|rive at the other."</P>
<P>"I think, at pre&s;ent, the ri&s;k of one would be too hazardous, and &s;o I wi&s;h you a good night." And he went out of the room &s;omewhat ab|ruptly.</P>
<P>"Lord Elmwood," &s;aid Mi&s;s Milner, "is very grave&mdash;he does not look like a man who has been pa&s;&s;ing his evening with the woman he loves."</P>
<P>"Perhaps he is melancholy at parting from her," &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley.</P>
<P>"More likely offended," &s;aid Sandford "at the manner in which that lady has &s;poken of her."</P>
<P>"Who, I?" cried Mi&s;s Milner, "I prote&s;t I &s;aid nothing but&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Nothing, madam? did you not &s;ay &s;he was gloomy?"</P>
<P>"But, what I thought&mdash;I was going to add, Mr. Sandford."</P>
<P>"When you think unju&s;tly, you &s;hould not ex|pre&s;s your thoughts."</P>
<P>"Then, perhaps, I &s;hould never &s;peak."</P>
<P>"And it were better you did not, if what you &s;ay, is to give pain.&mdash;Do you know, madam, that my lord is going to be married to Mi&s;s Fenton?"</P>
<P>"Yes," an&s;wered Mi&s;s Milner.</P>
<P>"Do you know that he loves her?"</P>
<P>"No;" an&s;wered Mi&s;s Milner.</P>
<P>"How, madam! do you &s;uppo&s;e he does not?"</P>

&s;he has a great deal of vivacity which proceeds from the heart."</P>
<P>"No, if it proceeded, I &s;hould admire it too; but it re&s;ts there, and no one is the better for it."</P>

<P>"Di&s;pute, madam!" &s;aid Sandford, I never di&s;|puted with any one beneath a doctor of divinity in my life.&mdash;I was only cautioning your friend not to make light of virtues, which it would do her ho|hour to po&s;&s;e&s;s.&mdash;Mi&s;s Fenton is a mo&s;t amiable young woman, and worthy ju&s;t &s;uch a hu&s;band as my Lord Elmwood will make her."</P>
<P>"I am &s;ure," &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley, "Mi&s;s Milner thinks &s;o&mdash;&s;he has a high opinion of Mi&s;s Fenton&mdash;&s;he was at pre&s;ent only je&s;ting."</P>
<P>"But, madam, je&s;ts are very pernicious things, when delivered with a malignant &s;neer.&mdash;I have known a je&s;t de&s;troy a lady's reputation&mdash;I have known a je&s;t give one per&s;on a di&s;ta&s;te for another&mdash;I have known a je&s;t break off a marriage."</P>
<P>"But I &s;uppo&s;e there is no apprehen&s;ion of that, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e?" &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley&mdash;wi&s;hing he might an&s;wer in the affirmative.</P>
<P>"Not that I can fore&s;ee," replied he.&mdash;"No, Heaven forbid; for I look upon them to be formed for each other&mdash;their di&s;po&s;itions, their pur&s;uits, their inclinations the &s;ame.&mdash;Their pa&s;&s;ions for each other ju&s;t the &s;ame&mdash;pure&mdash;white as &s;now."</P>
<P>"And I dare &s;ay, not warmer," replied Mi&s;s Milner.</P>
<P>He looked provoked beyond mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>"Dear Mi&s;s Milner," cried Mi&s;s Woodley, "how can you talk thus? I believe in my heart you are only envious my lord did not offer him&s;elf to you."</P>
<P>"To her!" &s;aid Sandford, affecting an air of
<PB N="131" REF="025650_0134_0FCEB1E2078A09D8">
the utmo&s;t &s;urpri&s;e, "to her? Do you think his lord&s;hip received a di&s;pen&s;ation from his vows to become the hu&s;band of a coquette&mdash;a&mdash;" he was going on.</P>
<P>"Nay, Mr. Sandford," cried Mi&s;s Milner, "I believe my greate&s;t crime in your eyes, is being a heretic."</P>
<P>"By no means, madam&mdash;it is the only circum|&s;tance that can apologize for your faults; and had you not that excu&s;e, there would be none for you."</P>
<P>"Then, at pre&s;ent, there is an excu&s;e&mdash;I thank you, Mr. Sandford; this is the kinde&s;t thing you ever &s;aid to me. But I am vext to &s;ee you are &s;orry, you have &s;aid it."</P>
<P>"Angry at your being a heretic?" he re&s;umed, "Indeed I &s;hould be much more concerned to &s;ee you a di&s;grace to our religion."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner had not been in a good humour during the whole evening&mdash;&s;he had been provoked to the full extent of her patience &s;everal times; but this har&s;h &s;entence hurried her beyond all bounds, and &s;he aro&s;e from her &s;eat in the mo&s;t violent agitation, and exclaimed, "What have I done to be treated thus?"</P>
<P>Though Mr. Sandford was not a man ea&s;ily inti|midated, he was on this occa&s;ion evidently alarmed; and &s;tared about him with &s;o &s;trong an expre&s;&s;ion of &s;urpri&s;e, that it partook in &s;ome degree of fear.&mdash;Mi&s;s Woodley cla&s;ped her friend in her arms, and cried with the tendere&s;t affection and pity, "My dear Mi&s;s Milner, be compo&s;ed."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner &s;at down, and was &s;o for a minute; but her dead &s;ilence was nearly as alarming to Sand|ford as her rage had been; and he did not perfectly recover him&s;elf till he &s;aw a flood of tears pouring down her face; he then heaved a &s;igh of content that it had &s;o ended, but in his heart re&s;olved never to forget the ridiculous affright into which he had

been put.&mdash;He &s;tole out of the room without ut|tering a &s;yllable&mdash;But as he never retired to re&s;t before he had repeated a long form of evening pray|ers, &s;o when he came to that part which &s;upplicates "Grace for the wicked," he named Mi&s;s Milner's name, with the mo&s;t fervent devotion.</P>

<P>AMONG the many &s;leeple&s;s nights Mi&s;s Mil|ner pa&s;&s;ed, the pre&s;ent was not one of them; it is true &s;he had a weight of care upon her heart, even heavier than u&s;ual, but its burthen had overcome her &s;trength; and wearied out with hopes, with fears, and at the end with di&s;appointment and rage, &s;he &s;unk into a profound &s;lumber as &s;oon as &s;he was laid down&mdash;but the more forgetfulne&s;s had pre|vailed, the greater was the force of remembrance when &s;he awoke&mdash;At fir&s;t, &s;o &s;ound had her &s;leep been, &s;he had a difficulty in calling to mind why &s;he was unhappy; but that &s;he was unhappy, &s;he well recollected&mdash;and when the cau&s;e came to her me|mory, &s;he would have &s;lept again, but that was im|po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Though her re&s;t had been &s;ound, it had not been refre&s;hing; &s;he was far from well, and &s;ent word &s;o, as an apology for not being pre&s;ent at breakfa&s;t. Lord Elmwood looked concerned when the me&s;&s;age was delivered; Mr. Sandford &s;hook his head.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner's health is not good," &s;aid Mrs. Hor|ton a few minutes after.</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood laid down the new&s;paper to at|tend to her.</P>
<P>"To me there is &s;omething very extraordinary
<PB N="133" REF="025650_0136_0FCEB1E2F3BE0C48">
about her," continued Mrs. Horton, finding &s;he had caught his lord&s;hip's attention.</P>
<P>"So there is to me," added Sandford, with a &s;arca&s;tick &s;neer.</P>
<P>"And &s;o there is to me," &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley, with a mo&s;t &s;erious face, and heart-felt &s;igh.</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood gazed by turns at each, as each delivered their &s;entiments&mdash;and when they were all &s;ilent, he looked bewildered, not knowing what judgment to form from any of the&s;e &s;entences.</P>
<P>Soon after breakfa&s;t Mr. Sandford withdrew to his own apartment; Mrs. Horton in a little time went to her's, and Lord Elmwood and Mi&s;s Wood|ley were left alone.&mdash;His lord&s;hip immediately ro&s;e from his &s;eat, and &s;aid,</P>
<P>"I think, Mi&s;s Woodley, Mi&s;s Milner was ex|tremely to blame, though I did not choo&s;e to tell her &s;o before Mr. Sandford, in giving my Lord Frederick an opportunity of &s;peaking to her; unle&s;s &s;he means he &s;hall renew his addre&s;&s;es."</P>
<P>"That, I am &s;ure, my lord," replied Mi&s;s Woodley, "&s;he does not mean&mdash;and I a&s;&s;ure you, my lord, &s;eriou&s;ly, it was by mere accident &s;he &s;aw him ye&s;terday evening; or permitted him to at|tend her to her carriage."</P>
<P>"I am glad to hear it;" he returned quickly; "for although I am not of a &s;u&s;picious nature, yet in regard to her affection for him, I cannot but have my doubts."</P>
<P>"You need have none, my lord," replied Mi&s;s Woodley, with a &s;mile of confidence.</P>
<P>"And yet you mu&s;t own her behaviour has war|ranted them&mdash;has it not been in this particular in|coherent, undefinable, unaccountable!"</P>
<P>"The behaviour of a per&s;on in love, no doubt," &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley.</P>
<P>"Don't I &s;ay &s;o?" returned he warmly, "And is not that a ju&s;t rea&s;on for my &s;u&s;picions?"</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="025650_0137_0FCEB1B23B269FB8">
"But is there only one man in the world on whom the&s;e &s;u&s;picions &s;hould fix?" &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley with the colour mounting into her face.</P>
<P>"Not that I know of&mdash;not one more than I know of," returned he, with a&s;toni&s;hment at what &s;he had in&s;inuated, and yet with a perfect a&s;&s;urance &s;he was in the wrong.</P>
<P>"Perhaps I am mi&s;taken," replied &s;he.</P>
<P>"Nay, that is impo&s;&s;ible too&mdash;" returned he with anxiety, "You &s;hare her confidence; you are perpetually with her; and provided &s;he did not confide in you, you mu&s;t know, mu&s;t be acquainted with her inclinations."</P>
<P>"I believe I am <HI>perfectly</HI> acquainted with them," replied Mi&s;s Woodley, with a &s;ignificance in her voice and manner which convinced him there was &s;ome &s;ecret to learn.</P>
<P>After a he&s;itation;</P>
<P>"It is far from me," replied he, "to wi&s;h to be entru&s;ted with the private &s;entiments of tho&s;e who de&s;ired to with hold them from me, much le&s;s would I take any unfair means of being informed of them&mdash;to a&s;k any more from you, I believe, would be unfair&mdash;yet I cannot but lament, that I am not as well informed as you are.&mdash;I wi&s;h to prove my friend&s;hip to Mi&s;s Milner, but &s;he will not &s;uffer me&mdash;and every &s;tep I take for her happine&s;s, I take in the mo&s;t perplexing uncertainty."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley &s;ighed, but did not &s;peak.&mdash;He &s;eemed to wait for her reply, but as &s;he made none, he proceeded.</P>
<P>"If ever a breach of confidence could be tole|rated, I certainly know no occa&s;ion that would &s;o ju&s;tly authori&s;e &s;uch a mea&s;ure as the pre&s;ent.&mdash;I am not only proper from my character, but from my circum&s;tances to be relied upon&mdash;my intere&s;t, is &s;o nearly connected with the intere&s;t, and my hap|pine&s;s with the happine&s;s of my ward, that tho&s;e

principles as well as my honour, would protect her from every peril ari&s;ing from my being tru&s;ted."</P>

<P>"Why &s;o?" (&s;aid he warmly,) "But that is the way&mdash;the per&s;on who is our friend we mi&s;doubt&mdash;where a common intere&s;t is concerned, we are a&s;hamed of drawing on a common danger&mdash;Afraid of advice, though that advice is to &s;ave us.&mdash;Mi&s;s Woodley, &s;aid he, (changing his voice with exce&s;s of earne&s;tne&s;s) do you believe that I would do any thing to make Mi&s;s Milner happy?"</P>
<P>"Any thing in honour, my lord."</P>
<P>"She can de&s;ire nothing farther,"&mdash;he replied in agitation&mdash;"Are her de&s;ires &s;o unwarrantable I cannot grant them?"</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley again did not &s;peak&mdash;and he con|tinued.</P>
<P>"Great as my friend&s;hip is, there are certain bounds to it; bounds, that &s;hall &s;ave her in &s;pite of her&s;elf."&mdash;And he rai&s;ed his voice.</P>
<P>"In the di&s;po&s;al of them&s;elves," re&s;umed he, with a le&s;s vehement tone, "that great, that ter|rific di&s;po&s;al in marriage, (at which I have ever looked with affright and di&s;may) there is no ac|counting for the ra&s;hne&s;s of a woman's choice, or &s;ometimes for the depravity of her ta&s;te.&mdash;But in &s;uch a ca&s;e, Mi&s;s Milner's election of a hu&s;band &s;hall not direct mine&mdash;if &s;he does not know her own value, I do.&mdash;Independent of her fortune, &s;he has beauty to captivate the heart of any man; and with all her follies, &s;he has a frankne&s;s in her man|ner, an unaffected wi&s;dom in her thoughts, a viva|city in her conver&s;ation, and withal, a &s;oftne&s;s in her demeanour, that might alone engage the affec|tions

<P>"My lord, Mi&s;s Milner's ta&s;te is not a depraved one; it is but too much refined."</P>
<P>"What do you mean by that, Mi&s;s Woodley? you talk my&s;teriou&s;ly.&mdash;Is &s;he not afraid I will thwart her inclinations?"</P>
<P>"She is &s;ure you will, my lord."</P>
<P>"Then mu&s;t not the per&s;on be unworthy of her?"</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley ro&s;e from her &s;eat, the tears trink|led down her cheeks, &s;he cla&s;ped her hands, and every look, every ge&s;ture proved her alternate re|&s;olution, and irre&s;olution of proceeding farther&mdash;Lord Elmwood's attention was arre&s;ted before, but now it was fixed in a degree, which her manner <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ould only occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>"My lord," &s;aid &s;he, with a tremulous voice, "promi&s;e me, declare to me, &s;wear to me, it &s;hall ever remain a &s;ecret in your own brea&s;t, and I will reveal to you, on whom &s;he has placed her affec|tions."</P>
<P>This &s;olemn preparation made Lord Elmwood tremble; and he ran over in&s;tantly in his mind all the per&s;ons he could recollect, in order to arrive at the knowledge by thought, quicker than by words.&mdash;It was in vain he tried, and he once more turned his inquiring eyes upon Mi&s;s Woodley.&mdash;He &s;aw her &s;ilent and covered with confu&s;ion.&mdash;Again he &s;earched his own thoughts, nor ineffectually as be|fore,&mdash;At the fir&s;t glance the object was pre&s;ented, and he beheld <HI>him&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>The rapid emotion of varying pa&s;&s;ions, which immediately darted over his features, informed Mi&s;s Woodley her &s;ecret was di&s;covered&mdash;&s;he hid
<PB N="137" REF="025650_0140_0FCEB1E7496E1BB8">
her face, while the tears that fell down to her bo&s;om, confirmed him in the truth of his &s;ugge&s;tion beyond what oaths could have done.&mdash;A &s;hort in|terval of &s;ilence followed, during which &s;he &s;uffered tortures for the manner in which he would next &s;peak to her&mdash;two &s;econds gave her this reply:</P>
<P>"For God's &s;ake take care what you are doing&mdash;you are de&s;troying my pro&s;pects of futurity&mdash;you are making this world too dear to me."</P>
<P>Her drooping head was then lifted up, and as &s;he caught the eye of Dorriforth, &s;he &s;aw it beam expectation, amaze, joy, ardour, love.&mdash;Nay, there was a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ire, a vehemence in the quick fa&s;cinat|ing rays it &s;ent forth, &s;he never before had &s;een&mdash;it filled her with alarm&mdash;&s;he wi&s;hed him to love Mi&s;s Milner, but to love her with moderation.&mdash;Mi&s;s Woodley was too little ver&s;ed in the &s;ubject to know, that, had been, not to love at all; at lea&s;t not the extent of breaking through engagements, and all the various ob&s;tacles, that &s;till militated a|gain&s;t their union.</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood was &s;en&s;ible of the embarra&s;&s;ment his pre&s;ence gave Mi&s;s Woodley, and under&s;tood the reproaches which &s;he &s;eemed to vent upon her|&s;elf in &s;ilence.&mdash;To relieve her from both, he laid his hand with force upon his heart, and &s;aid, "Do you believe me?"</P>
<P>"I do, my lord," &s;he an&s;wered trembling.</P>

<P>"We are not judges of what belongs to our|&s;elves;"&mdash;he replied,&mdash;"I am tran&s;ported at the tidings you have revealed, and yet, perhaps, I had better never have heard them."</P>

<P>MISS WOODLEY &s;tood for &s;ome time to con|&s;ider which way &s;he was to go.&mdash;The fir&s;t per|&s;on &s;he met would inquire, why &s;he had been weeping to that exce&s;s her eyes were &s;carce di&s;cern|able? and if Mi&s;s Milner was to a&s;k the que&s;tion, in what words could &s;he tell, or in what manner deny the truth?&mdash;To avoid her, was the fir&s;t cau|tion, and &s;he took the only method; &s;he had a hackney-coach ordered, rode &s;everal miles out of town, and returned to dinner with &s;o little remains of her &s;woln eyes, that complaining of the head|ach was a &s;ufficient excu&s;e for them.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner was enough recovered to be pre&s;ent at dinner, though &s;he &s;carce ta&s;ted a mor&s;el. Lord Elmwood did not dine at home, at which Mi&s;s Woodley rejoiced, but at which Mr. Sandford ap|peared highly di&s;appointed.&mdash;He a&s;ked the &s;ervants,

&s;everal times, "what his lord&s;hip &s;aid when he went out?" they replied, "nothing more than that he &s;hould not be at home to dinner."&mdash;"I can't ima|gine where he dines?" &s;aid Sandford.&mdash;"Ble&s;s me, Mr. Sandford, can't you gue&s;s?"

<P>Notwith&s;tanding the anxiety and trouble under which Mi&s;s Woodley had laboured all the morning, her heart for many weeks had not felt &s;o light as it did this day at dinner&mdash;The confidence &s;he repo&s;ed in the promi&s;es of Lord Elmwood&mdash;the firm reli|ance &s;he had upon his delicacy and his ju&s;tice&mdash;the unabated kindne&s;s with which her friend received her, while no one &s;u&s;picious thought, &s;he knew, had taken harbour in her bo&s;om&mdash;and the con&s;ci|ous integrity of her own intentions, however &s;he might be mi&s;led by her judgment, all con&s;pired to comfort her with the hope, &s;he had done nothing &s;he ought to wi&s;h recalled&mdash;But although &s;he felt thus tranquil, in re&s;pect to what &s;he had divulged, yet &s;he felt a great deal embarra&s;&s;ed with the dread of next &s;eeing Lord Elmwood.</P>

Lord Elmwood as he advanced to the table bowed, not having &s;een the ladies &s;ince morning, or Mi&s;s Milner that day; they returned his &s;alute, and he was going up to Mi&s;s Milner, (&s;eemingly to inquire of her health,) when Mr. Sandford, laying down his book, &s;aid,</P>
<P>"My lord, where have you been all day?"</P>
<P>"I have been very bu&s;y," replied his lord|&s;hip, and walking from the card-table, went up to him.</P>

<P>Mrs. Horton begged her "To mind what &s;he was about."</P>

<P>The earne&s;tne&s;s and empha&s;is with which the&s;e few words were pronounced, were more flattering than the fine&s;t turned compliment had been; her gratitude was expre&s;&s;ed by blu&s;hes, and by a&s;&s;uring his lord&s;hip &s;he was now "&s;o well as to be able to &s;up on what was before her."&mdash;She &s;poke, however, and had not made the trial; for the moment &s;he carried a piece to her lips, &s;he laid it on her plate again, and turned paler, from the vain endeavour to force her appetite. Lord Elmwood had ever been attentive to her, but now he watched her as he would a child; and when he &s;aw by her &s;truggles &s;he could not eat, he took her plate from her; gave her &s;omething el&s;e; and all with care and watch|fulne&s;s in his looks, as if he had been a tender|hearted boy, and &s;he his darling bird, the lo&s;s of which, would embitter all the joy of his holidays.</P>
<P>This attention had &s;omething about it &s;o tender, &s;o officious, and yet &s;o &s;incere, that it brought the tears into Mi&s;s Woodley's eyes, attracted the notice of Mr. Sandford, and the ob&s;ervation of Mrs. Hor|ton, while the heart of Mi&s;s Milner overflowed with a gratitude that gave place to no &s;entiment, except her love.</P>
<P>To relieve that anxiety her guardian expre&s;&s;ed, &s;he endeavoured to appear cheerful, and that anx|iety,

at length, really made her &s;o.&mdash;He now pre&s;&s;ed her to take one gla&s;s of wine with &s;uch &s;olicitude, he &s;eemed to &s;ay a thou&s;and things be&s;ide&mdash;Sand|ford &s;till made his ob&s;ervations, and being unu&s;ed to conceal his thoughts, before the pre&s;ent com|pany, he &s;aid, bluntly, "Mi&s;s Fenton was indi&s;|po&s;ed the other night, my lord, and yet you did not &s;eem half &s;o anxious about her health."</P>
<P>Had Sandford laid all Lord Elmwood's e&s;tate at Mi&s;s Milner's feet, or pre&s;ented her with that eternal bloom which adorns the face of a godde&s;s, he would have done le&s;s to endear him&s;elf to her, than by that &s;ingle &s;entence&mdash;&s;he looked at him with the mo&s;t benign countenance, and felt affliction that &s;he had ever offended him.</P>
<P>"Mi&s;s Fenton," (Lord Elmwood replied) "has a brother with her; her health and happine&s;s are in his care, Mi&s;s Milner's are in mine."</P>
<P>"Mr. Sandford," &s;aid Mi&s;s Milner, "I am a|fraid I behaved very uncivilly to you la&s;t night; will you accept of an atonement?</P>
<P>"No, madam," returned he, "I accept no ex|piation without amendment."</P>
<P>"Well then," &s;aid &s;he, &s;miling, "&s;uppo&s;e I pro|mi&s;e never to offend you again, what then?"</P>
<P>"Why then, you'll break your promi&s;e," re|turned he, churli&s;hly.</P>
<P>"Do not promi&s;e," &s;aid Lord Elmwood, "for he means to provoke you to it.</P>
<P>In the like conver&s;ation the evening was pa&s;&s;ed, and Mi&s;s Milner retired to re&s;t in far better &s;pirits than the morning's pro&s;pect had given her to hope for. Mi&s;s Woodley too, had cau&s;e to be well plea&s;ed, but her plea&s;ure was in a great mea&s;ure eclip&s;ed by the reflection, "there was &s;uch a per|&s;on as Mi&s;s Fenton;" &s;he could not but fear, that in doing Mi&s;s Milner a right, &s;he had, perhaps, done that lady a wrong&mdash;&s;he wi&s;hed &s;he had been

equally acquainted with her heart, as &s;he was with Mi&s;s Milner's, and &s;he would then have acted with|out inju&s;tice to either; but Mi&s;s Fenton had of late &s;hunned their &s;ociety, and even in their company &s;he was of a temper too re&s;erved to di&s;cover her mind; Mi&s;s Woodley was therefore obliged to act to the be&s;t of her judgment only, and leave all events to providence.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXIV.</HEAD>
<P>WITHIN a few days, in the hou&s;e of Lord Elmwood, every thing, and every per&s;on wore a new face.&mdash;His lord&s;hip was the profe&s;&s;ed lover of Mi&s;s Milner&mdash;&s;he, the happie&s;t of human beings&mdash;Mi&s;s Woodley partaking in her joy&mdash;while Mr. Sandford was lamenting with the deepe&s;t concern, that Mi&s;s Fenton had been &s;upplanted; and what added mo&s;t poignantly to his &s;orrow was, that &s;he had been &s;upplanted by Mi&s;s Milner.&mdash;Though a church-man, he bore his di&s;appointment with the impatience of one of the laity; he could hardly &s;peak to Lord Elmwood; he would not look at Mi&s;s Milner, and was di&s;plea&s;ed with every body.&mdash;It was his intention when he fir&s;t became ac|quainted with Lord Elmwood's re&s;olution, to quit his hou&s;e; and as his lord&s;hip had, with the ut|mo&s;t degree of inflexibility, re&s;i&s;ted all his good coun&s;el and advice upon this &s;ubject, he re&s;olved, in quitting him, never to be his advi&s;er or coun&s;ellor again.&mdash;But, in preparing to leave his friend, his pupil, his patron, and yet him, who, upon mo&s;t occa&s;ions, implicitly obeyed his will, the &s;piritual got the better of the temporal man, and he deter|mined to &s;tay, le&s;t in totally abandoning him to the
<PB N="144" REF="025650_0147_0FCEB1EEF6C42058">
pur&s;uit of his own pa&s;&s;ions, he might make his puni&s;hment even greater than his offence.&mdash;"My lord," &s;aid he, "on the &s;tormy &s;ea, upon which you are embarked, though you will not &s;hun the rocks your faithful pilot would point out, he will, neverthele&s;s, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ail in your company, and lament over your watery grave. The more you &s;light my ad|vice, the more you want it, and till you command me to leave your hou&s;e, as I &s;uppo&s;e you will &s;oon do, (to oblige your lady) I will continue along with you."</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood liked him &s;incerely, and was glad he took this re&s;olution; yet, as &s;oon as his lord|&s;hip's rea&s;on and affections had once told him, he ought to break with Mi&s;s Fenton, and marry his ward, he became &s;o decidedly of that opinion, Sandford's never had the mo&s;t trivial weight upon the &s;ubject, nor would he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">latter the &s;uppo&s;ed au|thority he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed over him, by urging him to re|main in his hou&s;e a &s;ingle day, contrary to his inclinations. Sandford beheld, with grief, his firm|ne&s;s, but finding it vain to contend, &s;ubmitted&mdash;not, however, with a good grace.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t all the per&s;ons affected by this change in Lord Elmwood's marriage de&s;igns, Mi&s;s Fenton was, perhaps, the lea&s;t&mdash;&s;he would have been con|tent to have married, &s;he was content to live &s;ingle&mdash;Mr. Sandford was the fir&s;t who made overtures to her on the part of Lord Elmwood, and the fir&s;t &s;ent to a&s;k her to di&s;pen&s;e with the obligation&mdash;She received both the&s;e propo&s;als with the &s;ame in&s;ipid &s;mile of approbation, and the &s;ame cold indifference at the heart.</P>
<P>It was a perfect knowledge of this di&s;po&s;ition in his intended wife, which had given to Lord Elm|wood's thoughts, on matrimony, the pro&s;pect of dreary winter; but the &s;en&s;ibility of Mi&s;s Milner had now rever&s;ed that pro&s;pect to perpetual &s;pring;
<PB N="145" REF="025650_0148_0FCEB1EEF6C42058">
or the dearer variety of &s;pring, &s;ummer, and au|tumn.</P>
<P>It was a knowledge al&s;o of this torpor in Mi&s;s Fenton's nature, from which he formed the purpo&s;e of breaking with her; for Lord Elmwood &s;till re|tained enough of the prie&s;t's &s;anctity, to have yielded up his own happine&s;s, and even that of his beloved ward, rather than have plunged one heart into affliction by his perfidy. This, before he of|fered his hand to Mi&s;s Milner, he was perfectly convinced would not be the ca&s;e&mdash;even Mi&s;s Fenton, her&s;elf, a&s;&s;ured him, her thoughts were more in|clined towards the joys of Heaven than earth; and as this circum&s;tance would, &s;he believed, induce her to retire to a convent, &s;he thought it a happy, rather than an unhappy event.&mdash;Her brother, on whom her fortune devolved, if &s;he took this re&s;o|lution, was exactly of her opinion.</P>
<P>Lo&s;t in the maze of happine&s;s which &s;urrounded her, Mi&s;s Milner oftentimes a&s;ked her heart, and her heart whi&s;pered like a flatterer, "Yes." Are not my charms even more invincible than I ever be|lieved them to be? Dorriforth, the grave, the &s;anctified, the anchorite Dorriforth, by their force is animated to all the ardour of the mo&s;t impa&s;&s;ioned lover&mdash;while the proud prie&s;t, the au&s;tere guardian, is humbled, if I but frown, into the verie&s;t &s;lave of love.&mdash;She then a&s;ked, "Why did I not keep him longer in &s;u&s;pen&s;e? he could not have loved me more, I believe; but my power over him might have been greater &s;till.&mdash;I am the happie&s;t of women in that affection he has proved to me, but I wonder whether it would exi&s;t under ill-treatment? if it would not, he does not love me as I wi&s;h to be loved&mdash;if it would, my triumph, my felicity, would be enhanced."&mdash;The&s;e thoughts were mere phan|toms of the brain, and never by &s;y&s;tem put into
<PB N="146" REF="025650_0149_0FCEB2252C8DF9B0">
action; but repeatedly indulged, they were practi&s;ed by ca&s;ual occurrences; and the dear-bought ex|periment of being beloved in &s;pite of her faults, (a glory proud women ever a&s;pire to) was, at pre&s;ent, the ambition of Mi&s;s Milner.</P>
<P>Unthinking woman! &s;he did not reflect, that to the &s;earching eye of Lord Elmwood &s;he had faults, with her every care to conceal or overcome them, &s;ufficient to try all his love, and all his patience. But what female is not fond of experiments? to which, how few are there, that do not fall a &s;a|crifice!</P>
<P>Perfectly &s;ecure of the affections of the man &s;he loved, her declining health no longer threatened her; her declining &s;pirits returned as before; and the &s;u&s;picions of her guardian being now changed to the liberal confidence of a doating lover, &s;he now again profe&s;&s;ed all her former follies, all her fa&s;hi|onable levities, and indulged them with le&s;s re&s;traint than &s;he had ever done.</P>
<P>For a while, blinded by his pa&s;&s;ion, Lord Elm|wood encouraged and admired every new proof of her re&s;tored happine&s;s; nor till &s;ufferance had tempted her to proceed beyond her u&s;ual bounds, did he remon&s;trate.&mdash;But &s;he, who as his ward had been ever gentle, and (when he &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed) always obedient; he now found as a mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;ome|times haughty; and to oppo&s;ition, always in&s;olent.&mdash;He was &s;urpri&s;ed, but the novelty plea&s;ed him.&mdash;And Mi&s;s Milner, whom he tenderly loved, could put on no change, or appear in any new character that did not, for the time &s;he adopted it, &s;eem to become her.</P>
<P>Among the many cau&s;es of complaint &s;he gave him, want of oeconomy in the di&s;po&s;al of her in|come was one.&mdash;Bills and draughts came upon him without number, while the account, on her part of money expended, amounted but to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of
<PB N="147" REF="025650_0150_0FCEB1F0944796E0">
dre&s;s &s;he &s;ometimes never wore; toys that were out of fa&s;hion before they were paid for; and charities directed by the force of whim.&mdash;Another complaint was, as u&s;ual, extreme late hours, and oftentimes company he did not approve.</P>
<P>She was charmed to &s;ee his love &s;truggling with his cen&s;ure&mdash;his politene&s;s with his anxiety&mdash;and by the light, frivolous, or re&s;entful manner, in which &s;he treated his admonitions, &s;he triumphed in &s;howing to Mi&s;s Woodley, and, more e&s;pecially to Mr. Sandford, how much &s;he dared upon the &s;trength of his affections.</P>
<P>Every thing in preparation for their marriage, which was to take place at Elmwood-Hou&s;e during the &s;ummer months, &s;he re&s;olved for the &s;hort time &s;he had to remain in London, to let no occa&s;ion pa&s;s of ta&s;ting all tho&s;e plea&s;ures which were not likely ever to return; but which, eager as &s;he was in the pur&s;uit, &s;he &s;till placed in no kind of com|petition with tho&s;e &s;he hoped would &s;ucceed; tho&s;e more &s;edate, and far greater joys &s;he had in do|me&s;tic contemplation&mdash;and often, merely to ha&s;ten on the tedious hours that intervened, &s;he varied and diverted them with the many recreations her intended hu&s;band could not approve.</P>
<P>It &s;o happened, and it was unfortunate it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">id, that a law-&s;uit and &s;ome other intricate affairs that came with his title and e&s;tate, frequently kept Lord Elmwood from his hou&s;e part of the day; &s;ome|times the whole evening; and when at home, would often clo&s;et him for hours with his lawyers.&mdash;But while he was thus off his guard, Sandford never was&mdash;and had Mi&s;s Milner been the deare&s;t thing on earth to him, he could not have watched her more narrowly; or had &s;he been the fraile&s;t thing on earth, he could not have been more hard upon her, in all the accounts of her conduct he gave to
<PB N="148" REF="025650_0151_0FCEB226814A2B70">
Lord Elmwood.&mdash;His lord&s;hip knew Sandford's failing was to think ill of Mi&s;s Milner, he pitied him for it, and he pitied her for it&mdash;and all the ag|gravation his repre&s;entations gave to her real fol|lies, affection for them both, in the heart of Dor|riforth, &s;tood between every other impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>But facts are glaring; and he at length beheld tho&s;e faults in their true colours, although pre|viou&s;ly pointed out by the prejudice of Mr. Sand|ford.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as Sandford perceived his lord&s;hip's un|ea&s;ine&s;s, "There, my lord!" cried he, exultingly, "Did not I always &s;ay the marriage was an impro|per one? but you would not be ruled&mdash;you would not &s;ee."</P>
<P>"Can you blame me for not &s;eeing," replied his lord&s;hip, "when you your&s;elf were blind?&mdash;Had you been di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate, had you &s;een Mi&s;s Milner's virtues as well as her faults, I &s;hould have believed, and been guided by you&mdash;but you &s;aw her failings only, and therein have been equally deceived with me, who have only beheld her perfections."</P>
<P>"My ob&s;ervations, however, my lord, would have been of mo&s;t u&s;e to you; for I have &s;een what to avoid."</P>
<P>"But mine have been the mo&s;t charitable," re|plied his lord&s;hip, "for I have &s;een&mdash;what I mu&s;t always love."</P>
<P>Sandford &s;ighed, and lifted up his hands.</P>
<P>"Mr. Sandford," re&s;umed his lord&s;hip, with a voice and manner &s;uch as he puts on, when not all the power of Sandford, or any other, can change his fixed determination, "Mr. Sandford," re&s;umed he, "my eyes are now open to every failing, as well as to every accompli&s;hment; to every vice, as well as to every virtue of Mi&s;s Milner's; nor will I &s;uf|fer my&s;elf to be again prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in her favour by your prejudice again&s;t her&mdash;for I believe it was com|pa&s;&s;ion

<P>"I, my lord?" cried Sandford, "Do not load me with the burthen&mdash;with the mighty burthen of your love for her."</P>
<P>"Do not interrupt me," &s;aid his lord&s;hip; "Whatever your meaning has been, the effect of your unkindne&s;s to her, is what I &s;ay,&mdash;Now, I will no longer," continued he, "have an enemy &s;uch as you have been to heighten her charms, which are too tran&s;cendent in their native &s;tate, I will hear no more complaints again&s;t her, but I will watch her clo&s;ely my&s;elf&mdash;and if I find her mind and heart (&s;uch as my &s;u&s;picions have of late whi&s;|pered) too frivolous for that &s;ub&s;tantial happine&s;s I look for with an object &s;o beloved; depend upon my word&mdash;the marriage &s;hall yet be broken off."</P>
<P>"I Depend upon your word; it <HI>will</HI> then," re|plied Sandford, eagerly.</P>
<P>"You are unju&s;t, Sir, in &s;aying &s;o before the trial," replied his lord&s;hip, "and your inju&s;tice &s;hall make me more cautious, le&s;t I follow your ex|ample."</P>
<P>"But, my lord&mdash;"</P>
<P>"My mind is made up, Mr. Sandford," returned he, interrupting him, "I am no longer engaged to Mi&s;s Milner than &s;he &s;hall de&s;erve I &s;hould&mdash;but in my ob&s;ervations I will take care not to wrong her as you have done."</P>
<P>"My lord, call my ob&s;ervations wrong, when you have reflected upon them as a man, and not as a lover&mdash;dive&s;t your&s;elf of your pa&s;&s;ion, and meet me upon equal ground."</P>
<P>"I will meet no one&mdash;I will con&s;ult no one&mdash;my own judgment &s;hall be the judge, and in a few months marry, or&mdash;<HI>bani&s;h me from her for ever.</HI>"</P>

There was &s;omething in the&s;e la&s;t words, in the tone and firmne&s;s with which they were delivered, that the heart of Sandford re&s;ted upon with con|tent&mdash;they bore the &s;ymptoms of a menace that would be executed; and he parted from his patron with congratulations upon his wi&s;dom, and the warme&s;t a&s;&s;urances of his firm reliance on his <HI>word.</HI></P>
<P>Lord Elmwood having come to this re&s;olution, was more compo&s;ed than he had been for &s;everal days before; while the horror of dome&s;tic wrang|les&mdash;a family without &s;ubordination&mdash;a hou&s;e with|out oeconomy&mdash;in a word, a wife without di&s;cre|tion, had been perpetually pre&s;ent to his mind.</P>
<P>Mr. Sandford, although he was a man of un|der&s;tanding, of learning, and a complete ca&s;ui&s;t; yet, all the faults he him&s;elf committed, were en|tirely&mdash;for want of knowing better. He con&s;tantly reproved faults in others, and he was mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly too good a man not to have corrected and amended his own, had they been known to him&mdash;but they were not.&mdash;He had been for &s;o long a time the &s;u|perior of all with whom he lived, had been &s;o bu&s;ied with in&s;tructing others, he had not recollected he him&s;elf wanted in&s;tructions&mdash;and in &s;uch awe did his &s;everity keep all about him, that notwith&s;tand|ing he had many friends, not one told him of his failings&mdash;(except ju&s;t now Lord Elmwood, but who, in this in&s;tance, as a man in love, he would not credit)&mdash;Was there not then &s;ome rea&s;on for him to &s;uppo&s;e he had no faults?&mdash;his enemies, indeed, hinted, that he had, but enemies he never heark|ened to: and thus, with all his good &s;en&s;e, wanted the &s;en&s;e to follow the rule, <HI>Believe what your ene|mies &s;ay of you, rather than what is &s;aid by your friends;</HI> this rule attended to, would make many a one amiable that is now the rever&s;e, and had made him, a perfect upright character.&mdash;For could an enemy,

<P>He was going to explain again, but Mi&s;s Milner entered, and put an end to the di&s;cour&s;e.&mdash;She had been pa&s;&s;ing the whole morning at an auction, and had laid out near two hundred pounds in different things &s;he had no one u&s;e for; but bought them becau&s;e they were &s;aid to be cheap.&mdash;Among the re&s;t was a lot of books on chemi&s;try, and &s;ome La|tin authors.</P>
<P>"Why, madam," cried Sandford, looking over the catalogue, where her purcha&s;es were marked by a pencil, "do you know what you have done? you can't read a word of the&s;e books."</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="025650_0157_0FCEB22C829F3FD8">
"Can't I, Mr. Sandford? but I a&s;&s;ure you, you will be va&s;tly plea&s;ed with them when you &s;ee how elegantly they are bound."</P>
<P>"My dear," &s;aid Mrs. Horton, "why have you bought china? you and Lord Elmwood have more now, than you have places to put them in."</P>
<P>"Very true, Mrs. Horton&mdash;I forgot that&mdash;but then you know I can give the&s;e away."</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood was in the room at the conclu&s;ion of this conver&s;ation&mdash;he &s;hook his head and &s;ighed.</P>
<P>"My lord," &s;aid &s;he, "I have had a very plea|&s;ant morning, but I wi&s;hed for you&mdash;if you had been with me I &s;hould have bought a great many other things; but I did not like to appear unrea|&s;onable in your ab&s;ence."</P>
<P>"Sandford fixed his inqui&s;itive eyes upon Lord Elmwood, to ob&s;erve his countenance&mdash;his lord&s;hip &s;miled, but appeared thoughtful.</P>
<P>"And, oh! my lord, I have bought you a pre|&s;ent," &s;aid &s;he.</P>
<P>"I do not wi&s;h for a pre&s;ent, Mi&s;s Milner."</P>
<P>"What, not from me?&mdash;very well."</P>
<P>"If you pre&s;ent me with your&s;elf, madam, it is all I a&s;k."</P>
<P>Sandford moved upon his chair, as if he &s;at un|ea&s;y.</P>
<P>"Why then, Mi&s;s Woodley," &s;aid Mi&s;s Milner, "<HI>you</HI> &s;hall have the pre&s;ent.&mdash;But then it won't &s;uit you&mdash;it is for a gentleman.&mdash;I'll keep it and give it to my Lord Frederick the fir&s;t time I meet with him.&mdash;I &s;aw him this morning, and he looked divinely; I longed to &s;peak to him."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley ca&s;t, by &s;tealth, an eye of appre|hen&s;ion upon Lord Elmwood's face, and trembled to behold it as red as &s;carlet.</P>
<P>Sandford &s;tared with both his eyes full upon him;
<PB N="155" REF="025650_0158_0FCEB1F8CC0996B8">
then drew him&s;elf upright on his chair, and took a pinch of &s;nuff upon the &s;trength of his unea&s;i|&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>A &s;ilence en&s;ued.</P>
<P>After a &s;hort time&mdash;"You all appear very me|lancholy," &s;aid Mi&s;s Milner; "I wi&s;h I had not come home yet."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley was in agony&mdash;&s;he &s;aw Lord Elm|wood's extreme di&s;plea&s;ure, and dreaded le&s;t he &s;hould expre&s;s it by &s;ome words he could not recall, or &s;he could not forgive&mdash;therefore, whi&s;pering to her &s;he had &s;omething particular to &s;ay to her, &s;he took her out of the room.</P>
<P>The moment &s;he was gone, Mr. Sandford ro&s;e nimbly from his &s;eat, rubbed his hands, walked bri&s;kly acro&s;s the room, then a&s;ked his lord&s;hip, in a cheerful tone, "Whether he dined at home to|day?"</P>
<P>That which had given Sandford &s;pirits to &s;peak with cheerfulne&s;s, had depre&s;&s;ed Lord Elmwood's &s;o much, that he fat &s;ilent and dejected.&mdash;At length he an&s;wered, in a faint voice, "No, I believe I &s;hall <HI>not</HI> dine at home."</P>
<P>"Where is your lord&s;hip going to dine?" a&s;ked Mrs. Horton; "I thought you &s;hould have had your company to-day; Mi&s;s Milner dines at home, I believe."</P>
<P>"I have not yet determined where I &s;hall dine," replied he, taking no notice of the conclu&s;ion of her &s;peech.</P>
<P>"My lord, if you mean to go to the hotel, I'll go with you, if you plea&s;e." Cried Sandford, offi|ciou&s;ly.</P>
<P>"With all my heart, Sandford," replied his lord|&s;hip; and they both went out together before Mi&s;s Milner returned to the apartment.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXV.</HEAD>
<P>MISS WOODLEY, for the fir&s;t time, di&s;obeyed the will of Mr. Sandford; and as &s;oon as Mi&s;s Milner and &s;he were alone, informed her of all he had revealed to her; accompanying the recital with every te&s;timony of &s;ympathy and affection.&mdash;But had the genius of Sandford pre&s;ided over this di&s;|covery, it could not have influenced the mind of Mi&s;s Milner to receive the intelligence, more ex|actly oppo&s;ite to the intention of the informer. In&s;tead of &s;huddering with fear at the menace Lord Elmwood had uttered, &s;he boldly &s;aid, &s;he "Dared him to perform it." "He dur&s;t not," repeated &s;he.</P>
<P>"Why dur&s;t not?" Said Mi&s;s Woodley.</P>
<P>"Becau&s;e he loves me too well&mdash;becau&s;e his own happine&s;s is too dear to him."</P>
<P>"I believe he loves you," replied Mi&s;s Woodley, "and yet there is a doubt if&mdash;"</P>
<P>"There &s;hall be no longer a doubt,"&mdash;cried Mi&s;s Milner, "I'll put him to the proof."</P>
<P>"For &s;hame, my dear! you talk incon&s;iderately&mdash;what do you mean by proof?"</P>
<P>"I mean, I will do &s;omething that any prudent man ought <HI>not</HI> to forgive; and yet, with that va&s;t &s;hare of prudence he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, I will force him &s;till to yield to his love."</P>
<P>"But &s;uppo&s;e you &s;hould be di&s;appointed, and he &s;hould not yield?" &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley.</P>
<P>"Then, I have only lo&s;t a man who had no re|gard for me."</P>
<P>"He may have a great regard for you, notwith|&s;tanding."</P>
<P>But for the love I have, and do &s;till bear my Lord
<PB N="157" REF="025650_0160_0FCEB1FB6AC44DA0">
Elmwood, I will have &s;omething more than a <HI>great regard</HI> in return."</P>
<P>"You have his love, I am &s;ure."</P>
<P>"But is it &s;uch as mine?&mdash;<HI>I</HI> could love <HI>him</HI> if he had a thou&s;and faults.&mdash;And yet," &s;aid &s;he, recol|lecting her&s;elf, "I believe, his being faultle&s;s, was the fir&s;t cau&s;e of my pa&s;&s;ion."</P>
<P>Thus &s;he talked on&mdash;&s;ometimes in anger, &s;ome|times apparently je&s;ting&mdash;till her &s;ervant came to tell her dinner was &s;erved. Upon entering the dining-room, and &s;eeing his lord&s;hip's place at table vacant, &s;he &s;tarted back. She was di&s;appointed of the plea&s;ure &s;he expected in dining with him; and his &s;udden ab&s;ence &s;o immediately after the intelligence &s;he had received from Mi&s;s Woodley, increa&s;ed her unea&s;ine&s;s.&mdash;She drew her chair, and &s;at down with an indifference, that &s;aid &s;he &s;hould not eat; and as &s;oon as &s;he was &s;eated, &s;he put her fingers &s;ullenly to her lips, nor touched her knife and fork, or &s;poke a word in reply to any thing that was &s;aid to her during the whole dinner.&mdash;Mi&s;s Woodley and Mrs. Horton were both too well acquainted with the good di&s;po&s;ition of her heart, to take of|fence, or any notice of this behaviour.&mdash;They dined, and wi&s;ely &s;aid nothing either to provoke or &s;ooth her.&mdash;Ju&s;t as the dinner was going to be removed, a loud rap came at the door&mdash;"Who is that?" &s;aid Mrs. Horton.&mdash;One of the &s;ervants went to the window, and an&s;wered, "My lord and Mr. Sandford, madam"&mdash;"Come back to dinner, as I live." Cried Mrs. Horton.&mdash;</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner &s;till continued her po&s;ition and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> nothing&mdash;but at the corners of her mouth, which her fingers did not entirely cover, there were di&s;|coverable a thou&s;and dimpled graces like &s;mall con|vul&s;ive fibres, which a re&s;trained &s;mile on Lord Elm|wood's return, had &s;ent there.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="025650_0161_0FCEB23107E4C850">
His lord&s;hip and Sandford entered.</P>
<P>"I am glad you are returned, my lord," &s;aid Mrs. Horton, "for Mi&s;s Milner would not eat a mor&s;el."</P>
<P>"It was becau&s;e I had no appetite," returned &s;he, blu&s;hing like crim&s;on.</P>
<P>"We &s;hould not have come back," &s;aid Sand|ford, "but at the place where we went to dine, all the rooms were filled with &s;moke."</P>
<P>"It has been a very windy day indeed," &s;aid Mrs. Horton, "and one part of this hou&s;e, is now in a &s;mother."</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood put the wing of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">owl on Mi&s;s Milner's plate, but without previou&s;ly a&s;king if &s;he cho&s;e any; yet &s;he conde&s;cended to eat&mdash;they &s;poke to each other too in the cour&s;e of conver&s;ation, yet it was with a re&s;erve that appeared as if they had been quarrelling, and &s;o felt to them&s;elves, though no &s;uch circum&s;tance had happened.</P>
<P>About two weeks pa&s;&s;ed away in this kind of di&s;|tant behaviour on both &s;ides; without either ven|turing a direct quarrel, and without either ex|pre&s;&s;ing (except inadvertently) their &s;trong affection for each other.</P>
<P>During this time they were once, however, nearly becoming the deare&s;t friends in expre&s;&s;ions, as well as in &s;entiments.&mdash;This aro&s;e from a favour he granted in compliance to what he knew was her earne&s;t de&s;ire; and, as a favour which he had re|fu&s;ed to the repeated reque&s;ts of many friends, &s;he could not but e&s;teem the high value of the ob|ligation.</P>
<P>She and Mi&s;s Woodley had taken an airing to &s;ee the poor child, young Ru&s;hbrook; and on their return, his lord&s;hip inquiring of the ladies how they had pa&s;&s;ed their morning, Mi&s;s Milner frankly told him; and added, "What pain it gave her to leave
<PB N="159" REF="025650_0162_0FCEB1FC8145A730">
the child behind, as he &s;till cried to come away with her."</P>
<P>"Go for him then to-morrow," &s;aid his lord|&s;hip, "and bring him home."</P>
<P>"Home!" &s;he repeated with &s;urpri&s;e.</P>
<P>"Yes," replied he, "if you de&s;ire it, this &s;hall be his home&mdash;you &s;hall be a mother, and I will, henceforward, be a father to him."</P>
<P>Sandford, who was pre&s;ent, looked unu&s;ually <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">our at this high token of his lord&s;hip's regard to Mi&s;s Milner; yet, with re&s;entment on his face, he wiped a tear of joy from his eye, for the boy's &s;ake&mdash;his frown was the force of prejudice, his tear the force of nature.</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook was brought home; and whenever Lord Elmwood wi&s;hed to &s;how a kindne&s;s to Mi&s;s Milner, without directing it immediately to her, he took his nephew upon his knee, talked to him, and told him, "He was glad they had become ac|quainted."</P>
<P>In the various, though delicate, &s;truggles for power between Mi&s;s Milner and her guardian, there was not one per&s;on witne&s;s to the&s;e incidents, who did not &s;uppo&s;e, all would at la&s;t end in wedlock&mdash;for the mo&s;t common ob&s;erver perceived, ardent love was the foundation of every di&s;content, as well, as of every joy they experienced.&mdash;One great incident, however, totally rever&s;ed the pro&s;pect of all future accommodation.</P>
<P>The fa&s;hionable Mrs. G&mdash;gave a ma&s;hed ball; tickets were pre&s;ented to per&s;ons of the fir&s;t quality, and among the re&s;t, three were &s;ent to Mi&s;s Milner.&mdash;She had never been at a ma&s;querade, and re|ceived them with extacy&mdash;more e&s;pecially as a ma&s;k being at the hou&s;e of a woman of fa&s;hion, &s;he did not conceive there could be any objection to her going.&mdash;She was mi&s;taken&mdash;the moment &s;he menti|oned

it to Lord Elmwood, he de&s;ired her, &s;ome|what &s;ternly, "Not to think of being there."&mdash;She was vext at the prohibition, but more at the manner in which it was delivered, and flatly &s;aid, "She &s;hould certainly go."</P>
<P>She expected a &s;evere rebuke for this, but what alarmed her much more, he never replied a word; but looked with a re&s;ignation which foreboded her more &s;orrow, than the &s;evere&s;t reproaches would have done&mdash;She &s;at for a minute reflecting how to rou&s;e him from this compo&s;ure&mdash;&s;he fir&s;t thought of attacking him with upbraidings; then &s;he thought of &s;oothing him; and at la&s;t of laughing at him.&mdash;This was the lea&s;t &s;upportable of all, and yet this &s;he ventured upon.</P>
<P>"I am &s;ure your lord&s;hip," &s;aid &s;he, "with all your &s;aintline&s;s, can have no objection to my being pre&s;ent at the ma&s;querade, provided I go as a Nun."</P>
<P>He made no reply.</P>
<P>"That is a habit," continued <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he, "which co|vers a multitude of faults&mdash;and, for that evening, I may have the chance of making a conque&s;t even of you, my lord&mdash;nay, I que&s;tion not, if under that inviting attire, even the pious Mr. Sandford would not ogle me."</P>
<P>"Hu&s;h,"&mdash;&s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley.</P>
<P>"Why hu&s;h?" cried Mi&s;s Milner, aloud, though Mi&s;s Woodley had &s;poken in a whi&s;per, "I am &s;ure," continued &s;he, "I am only repeating what I have read in books about nuns, and their con|fe&s;&s;ors."</P>
<P>"Your conduct, Mi&s;s Milner," replied Lord Elmwood, "gives evident proofs what authors you have read; you may &s;pare your&s;elf the trouble of quoting them."</P>
<P>Her pride was hurt at this, beyond bearing; and as &s;he could not, like him, govern her anger, it flu&s;hed in her face, and almo&s;t forced the tears.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="025650_0164_0FCEB1FDFA7B3CB8">
"My lord," &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley, (in a voice &s;o &s;oft and peaceful, it ought to have calmed the re|&s;entment of both,) "&s;uppo&s;e you were to accom|pany Mi&s;s Milner? there are tickets for three, and you can then have no objection."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner's brow was immediately &s;moothed; her eye beamed hope; and &s;he fetched a &s;igh in anxious expectation he would con&s;ent.</P>
<P>"I go, Mi&s;s Woodley?" he replied, with a&s;to|ni&s;hment, "Do you imagine I would play the buf|foon at a ma&s;querade?"</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner's face changed to its former &s;tate.</P>
<P>"I have &s;een many grave characters, my lord," &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley.</P>
<P>"Dear Mi&s;s Woodley," cried Mi&s;s Milner, "why per&s;uade Lord Elmwood to put on a ma&s;k, ju&s;t at the time he has &s;aid it a&s;ide?"</P>
<P>His patience now &s;eemed to be tempted to its height, and he an&s;wered, "If you &s;u&s;pect it, ma|dam, you &s;hall find me changed."</P>
<P>Plea&s;ed, &s;he had been able at la&s;t to irritate him, &s;he &s;miled with a degree of triumph, and in that humour was going to reply; but before &s;he thought of it, he abruptly left the room.</P>
<P>She was highly offended at this in&s;ult, and de|clared, "From that moment &s;he bani&s;hed him her heart for ever." And to prove &s;he &s;et both his love and anger at defiance, &s;he immediately ordered her chariot, and &s;aid, &s;he "was going to &s;ome of her acquaintance, whom &s;he knew had tickets, and with whom &s;he would fix upon the dre&s;s &s;he meant to appear in at the ma&s;querade; for nothing, unle&s;s &s;he was locked up, &s;hould alter the re&s;olution &s;he had taken, of being there." To remon&s;trate at that moment, Mi&s;s Woodley knew would be in vain; the chariot came to the door, and &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rove away.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="025650_0165_0FCEB233F4948E58">
She did not return to dinner, nor till late in the evening; Lord Elmwood was at home, but never once mentioned her name.</P>
<P>She came home, after he had retired to bed, and in great &s;pirits; the fir&s;t time &s;he ever appeared carele&s;s what he might think of her behaviour:&mdash;but her whole thoughts were occupied upon the bu&s;ine&s;s &s;he had been about, and her dre&s;s engro&s;&s;ed all her conver&s;ation as &s;oon as Mi&s;s Woodley and &s;he were alone.&mdash;She told Mi&s;s Woodley, &s;he had been &s;hown the greate&s;t variety of beautiful and becoming dre&s;&s;es &s;he had ever beheld, and yet, &s;aid &s;he, "I have fixed upon a very plain one; but one I look &s;o well in, you will hardly know me when I have it on."</P>
<P>"You are &s;eriou&s;ly then re&s;olved to go," &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley, "provided you hear no more on the &s;ubject from your guardian?"</P>
<P>"Whether I do or not, Mi&s;s Woodley, I am equally re&s;olved to go."</P>
<P>"But you know, my dear, he has de&s;ired you not&mdash;and you u&s;ed always to obey his commands."</P>
<P>"As my guardian, I certainly did obey him; and I could obey him as a hu&s;band; but as a lover, I will not."</P>
<P>"Yet that is the means never to have him for a hu&s;band."</P>
<P>"As he plea&s;es&mdash;for if he will not &s;ubmit to be my lover, I will not &s;ubmit to be his wife&mdash;nor has he the affection I require in a hu&s;band."</P>
<P>Thus, the old &s;entiments were repeated as heretofore, and prevented a &s;eparation till towards morning.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner, for that night, dreamt le&s;s of her guardian <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the ma&s;querade. On the evening of the next day it was to be; &s;he was up early, breakfa&s;ted in her dre&s;&s;ing-room, and remained there mo&s;t of the day, bu&s;ied in all the thou&s;and

preparations for the night; one of which, was to take every particle of powder out of her hair, and have it curled all over in falling ringlets.&mdash;Her next care was, that her dre&s;s &s;hould exactly fit, and di&s;|play her fine per&s;on to the be&s;t advantage&mdash;it did &s;o.&mdash;Mi&s;s Woodley entered as it was trying on, and was &s;truck with a&s;toni&s;hment at the elegance of the habit, and the beautiful effect it had upon her graceful per&s;on; but mo&s;t of all, &s;he was a&s;toni&s;hed at her venturing on &s;uch a character&mdash;for although it was the repre&s;entative of the godde&s;s of Cha&s;tity, yet from the bu&s;kins, and the petticoat made to fe&s;toon far above the ankle, it had, on the fir&s;t glance, the appearance of a female much le&s;s vir|tuous.&mdash;Mi&s;s Woodley admired the dre&s;s, yet ob|jected to it; but as &s;he admired at fir&s;t, her objec|tions after had no weight.</P>
<P>"Where is Lord Elmwood?" &s;aid Mi&s;s Milner, "he mu&s;t not &s;ee me."</P>
<P>"No, for heaven's &s;ake," cried Mi&s;s Woodley, "I would not have him &s;ee you for the univer&s;e."</P>
<P>"And yet," returned the other, with a &s;igh, "why am I then thus plea&s;ed with this dre&s;s? for I &s;hould rather he &s;hould admire me than all the world be&s;ide, and yet he is not to &s;ee me in it."</P>
<P>"But he would not admire you thus," &s;aid Mi&s;s Mi&s;s Woodley.</P>
<P>"You had better dre&s;s at the ladies' hou&s;e with whom you go," &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley; and this was agreed upon.</P>
<P>At dinner they learnt, his lord&s;hip was to go that evening to Wind&s;or, in order to be in readi|ne&s;s for the king's hunt, early in the morning; and this intelligence having di&s;per&s;ed Mi&s;s Milner's fears, &s;he concluded to dre&s;s at home.</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood appeared at dinner in an even, but not in a good temper;&mdash;the &s;ubject of the ma&s;|querade was never brought up, or indeed was once
<PB N="164" REF="025650_0167_0FCEB237B8692D68">
in his thoughts; for though he was offended at his ward's behaviour on the occa&s;ion, and thought &s;he committed a fault in telling him, "She would go," yet he never &s;u&s;pected &s;he meant to do &s;o, not even at the time &s;he &s;aid it, much le&s;s that &s;he would per&s;i&s;t, coolly and deliberately, in &s;o direct a con|tradiction to his will.&mdash;She, for her part, flattered her&s;elf his going to Wind&s;or, was intended in order to give her an opportunity of pa&s;&s;ing the evening as &s;he plea&s;ed, without his being obliged to know of it, and con&s;equently to complain.&mdash;Mi&s;s Woodley, who was willing to hope as &s;he wi&s;hed, began to be of the &s;ame opinion; and, without reluctance, dre&s;t her&s;elf as a wood-nymph, to accompany her friend.</P>

<P>AT half after eleven, Mi&s;s Milner's chair, and another with Mi&s;s Woodley, took them from Lord Elmwood's hou&s;e to call upon the party (a group of wood-nymphs and huntre&s;&s;es) which were to accom|pany them, and make up the &s;uit of Diana.</P>
<P>They had not left the hou&s;e two minutes when a thundering rap came at the door&mdash;it was Lord Elmwood in a po&s;t-chai&s;e.&mdash;Upon &s;ome occa&s;ion the next day's hunt was put off: he had been made acquainted with it, and came from Wind&s;or at that late hour&mdash;After his lord&s;hip had told Mrs. Hor|ton and Mr. Sandford, who were &s;itting together, the cau&s;e of his &s;udden return, and &s;ome &s;upper was ordered for him, he inquired, "What com|pany had ju&s;t left the hou&s;e?"</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="025650_0168_0FCEB2034D3AEEB0">
"We have been alone the whole evening, my lord," replied Mrs. Horton.</P>
<P>"Nay," returned he, "I &s;aw two chairs, with &s;everal &s;ervants, come out of the door as I drove up; but what livery I could not di&s;cern."</P>
<P>"We have had no creature here," repeated Mrs. Horton.</P>
<P>"Nor has Mi&s;s Milner?" a&s;ked he.</P>
<P>This brought Mrs. Horton to her recollection, and &s;he cried, "Oh! now I know."&mdash;And then checked her&s;elf as if &s;he knew too much.</P>
<P>"What do you know, madam?" &s;aid his lord|&s;hip, &s;harply.</P>
<P>"Nothing,"&mdash;&s;aid Mrs. Horton, "I know no|thing." And &s;he lifted up her hands and &s;hook her head.</P>
<P>"So all people &s;ay, who know a great deal," cried Sandford, "and I &s;u&s;pect, that is at pre&s;ent your ca&s;e."</P>
<P>"Then I know more than I wi&s;h to know, I am &s;ure, Mr. Sandford," returned &s;he, &s;hrugging up her &s;houlders.</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood was all impatience. "Explain, madam, explain," cried he.</P>
<P>"Dear my lord," &s;aid &s;he, "if your lord&s;hip will recollect, you may ju&s;t have the &s;ame know|ledge that I have."</P>
<P>"Recollect what?" &s;aid he, &s;ternly.</P>
<P>"The quarrel you and your ward had about the ma&s;querade."</P>
<P>"What of that?" &s;he is not gone there?" he cried.</P>
<P>"I am not &s;ure &s;he is," returned Mrs. Horton, "but if your lord&s;hip &s;aw two &s;edan chairs going out of this hou&s;e, I cannot but &s;u&s;pect it mu&s;t be Mi&s;s Milner, and my niece, going to the ma&s;que|rade."</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip made no an&s;wer, but rung the bell violently.&mdash;A &s;ervant entered.&mdash;Send Mi&s;s Milner's
<PB N="166" REF="025650_0169_0FCEB23936D798B8">
woman hither," &s;aid he, "immediately."&mdash;The man withdrew.</P>
<P>"Nay, my lord," cried Mrs. Horton, "any of the other &s;ervants could tell you ju&s;t as well, whe|ther Mi&s;s Milner is at home, or gone out."</P>
<P>"Perhaps not," replied he.</P>
<P>The maid entered.</P>
<P>"Where is your lady?" &s;aid he.</P>
<P>The woman had received no orders to conceal where her lady was gone, and yet &s;ome &s;ecret in|fluence which governs the replies of all waiting-women and chamber-maids, whi&s;pered to her, &s;he ought not to tell the truth.</P>
<P>"Where is your lady?" repeated Lord Elmwood, in a louder voice than before.</P>
<P>"Gone out, my lord," &s;he replied.</P>
<P>"Where?"</P>
<P>"My lady did not tell me."</P>
<P>"And don't you know?"</P>
<P>"No, my lord," &s;he an&s;wered, and without blu&s;hing.</P>
<P>"Is this the night of the ma&s;querade?" &s;aid he.</P>
<P>"I don't know, my lord, upon my word; but, I believe, my lord, it is not."</P>
<P>Sandford, as &s;oon as Lord Elmwood had a&s;ked the la&s;t que&s;tion, run ha&s;tily to the table, at the other &s;ide of the room, &s;natched &s;omething from it, and returned to his place again&mdash;and as &s;oon as the maid &s;aid, "It was not the night of the ma&s;que|rade," he exclaimed, "But it is, my lord, it is&mdash;yes it is." And &s;howing a news-paper he held in his hand, pointed to the paragraph which contained the information.</P>
<P>"Leave the room," &s;aid Lord Elmwood to the woman, "I have done with you."&mdash;She withdrew.</P>
<P>"Yes, yes, here it is," repeated Sandford, with a paper in his hand.&mdash;He then read the paragraph: "<HI>The ma&s;querade at the honourable Mrs. G&mdash;'s this
<PB N="167" REF="025650_0170_0FCEB20510C238E0">
evening"&mdash;</HI> "This evening, my lord, you find;" "<HI>it is expected will be the mo&s;t brilliant, of any thing of the kind, for the&s;e many years pa&s;t.</HI>"</P>
<P>"They &s;hould not put &s;uch things in the papers," &s;aid Mrs. Horton, "to tempt young women to their ruin." The word ruin, &s;eemed to grate upon his lord&s;hip's ear, and he &s;aid to the &s;ervant, who came to wait on him, while he &s;upped, "Take the &s;up|per away."&mdash;He had not attempted to eat, or even &s;it down; and he now walked backwards and for|wards in the room, lo&s;t in thought and care.</P>
<P>A little time after, one of Mi&s;s Milner's footmen came in upon &s;ome occa&s;ion, and Mr. Sandford &s;aid to him, "Pray did you attend your lady to the ma&s;|querade?"</P>
<P>"Yes, Sir," replied the man.</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood &s;topt him&s;elf &s;hort in his walk, and &s;aid to the &s;ervant, "You did?"</P>
<P>"Yes, my lord," replied he.</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip walked again.</P>
<P>"I &s;hould like to know what &s;he was dre&s;t in," &s;aid Mrs. Horton; and turning to the &s;ervant, "Do you know what your lady had on?"</P>
<P>"Yes, madam," replied the man, "&s;he was in men's cloaths."</P>
<P>"How?" cried Lord Elmwood.</P>
<P>"You tell a &s;tory to be &s;ure," &s;aid Mrs. Horton to the &s;ervant.</P>
<P>"No," cried Sandford, "I am &s;ure he does not; for he is an hone&s;t good young man, and would not tell a lie upon any account,&mdash;would you?"</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood ordered Mi&s;s Milner's woman to be again &s;ent up.&mdash;She came.</P>
<P>"In what dre&s;s did your lady go to the ma&s;que|rade?" A&s;ked his lord&s;hip, and with a look &s;o ex|tremely moro&s;e, it &s;eemed to command her to an|&s;wer in a word, and to an&s;wer truly.</P>
<P>A mind, with a &s;park of &s;en&s;ibility more than &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, could not have equivocated with &s;uch
<PB N="168" REF="025650_0171_0FCEB23D019C8960">
an interrogator, but her reply was, "She went in her own dre&s;s, my lord."</P>
<P>"Was it a man's or a woman's dre&s;s?" A&s;ked his lord&s;hip with the &s;ame commanding look.</P>
<P>"Ha, ha, my lord," (half laughing and half crying,) a woman's dre&s;s to be &s;ure, my lord."</P>
<P>On which Sandford cried,</P>
<P>"Call the footman up, and let him confront her."</P>
<P>He was called; but Lord Elmwood, now di&s;gu&s;ted with the &s;cene, &s;at down at the farther end of the room, and left Sandford to que&s;tion them.</P>
<P>With all the authority and con&s;equence of a country magi&s;trate, Sandford with his back to the fire, and the witne&s;&s;es before him, began with the footman.</P>
<P>"In what dre&s;s do you &s;ay, you &s;aw your lady, when you attended, and went along with her, to the ma&s;querade?"</P>
<P>"In men's cloaths," replied the man, boldly and firmly as before.</P>
<P>"Ble&s;s my &s;oul, George, how can you &s;ay &s;uch a thing?" cried the woman.</P>
<P>"In what dre&s;s do <HI>you</HI> &s;ay &s;he went in?" cried Sandford to her.</P>
<P>"In women's cloaths, indeed, Sir."</P>
<P>"This is very odd!" &s;aid Mrs. Horton.</P>
<P>"Had &s;he on, or had &s;he not on, a coat?" a&s;ked Sandford.</P>
<P>"Yes, Sir, a petticoat, replied the woman.</P>
<P>"Do <HI>you</HI> &s;ay &s;he had on a petticoat?" Said Sand|ford to the man.</P>
<P>"I can't an&s;wer exactly for that," replied he, "but I know &s;he had boots on."</P>
<P>"They were not boots." replied the maid, with vehemence, "indeed, Sir, (turning to Sandford) they were only half boots."</P>
<P>"My girl," &s;aid Sandford, kindly to her, "your
<PB N="169" REF="025650_0172_0FCEB2091F3C23B8">
own evidence convicts her.&mdash;What has a woman to do with <HI>any</HI> boots?"</P>
<P>Impatient at this mummery, Lord Elmwood ro&s;e from his &s;eat, and ordered the &s;ervants out of the room; and then looking at his watch, found it was near one. "At what time am I to expect her at home?" &s;aid he.</P>
<P>"Perhaps not till three in the morning." An|&s;wered Mrs. Horton.</P>
<P>"Three! &s;ix, more likely." cried Sandford.</P>
<P>"I can't wait with patience till that time," an|&s;wered his lord&s;hip with a mo&s;t anxious &s;igh.</P>
<P>"You had better go to bed, my lord," &s;aid Mrs. Horton, "and by &s;leeping, the time will pa&s;s away unperceived."</P>
<P>"If I <HI>could</HI> &s;leep, madam," returned he.</P>
<P>"Will you play a game of cards, my lord?" &s;aid Sandford, "for I will not leave you till &s;he comes home; and though I am not u&s;ed to &s;it up all night&mdash;"</P>
<P>"All night," repeated his lord&s;hip, "&s;he dur&s;t not &s;tay all night."</P>
<P>"And yet, after going," &s;aid Sandford, "in defiance to your commands, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e &s;he dares?"</P>
<P>"She is in good company, at lea&s;t, my lord," &s;aid Mrs. Horton.</P>
<P>"She does not know her&s;elf, what company &s;he is in," replied his lord&s;hip.</P>
<P>"How &s;hould &s;he?" cried Sandford, "where every one hides his face."</P>
<P>Till five o'clock in the morning, in &s;uch conver|&s;ation as this, the hours pa&s;&s;ed away.&mdash;Mrs. Hor|ton, indeed, retired to her chamber at two; and left the gentlemen to a graver di&s;cour&s;e, but a di&s;|cour&s;e &s;till le&s;s advantageous to poor Mi&s;s Milner.</P>
<P>She, during this time, was at the &s;cene of plea|&s;ure
<PB N="170" REF="025650_0173_0FCEB23ED37333C8">
&s;he had pictured to her&s;elf, and all the plea&s;ure it gave her was, that &s;he was &s;ure &s;he &s;hould never de&s;ire to go to a ma&s;querade again.&mdash;The crowd and bu&s;tle fatigued her&mdash;the freedom offended her delicacy&mdash;and though &s;he perceived &s;he was the fir&s;t object of admiration in the place, yet there was one per&s;on &s;till wanting to admire; and the remor&s;e at having tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed his injunctions for &s;o trivial an entertainment, weighed upon her &s;pirits, and added to its wearine&s;s.&mdash;She would have come away &s;ooner than &s;he did, but &s;he could not, with any degree of good manners, leave the company with whom &s;he went, and not till half after four were they pre|vailed on to return.</P>
<P>Day-light ju&s;t peeped through the &s;hutters of the room where his lord&s;hip and Sandford were &s;it|ting, when the &s;ound of her carriage, and its &s;ud|den &s;top at the door, cau&s;ed Lord Elmwood as &s;ud|denly to &s;tart from his &s;eat.&mdash;He trembled ex|tremely, and looked pale.&mdash;Sandford was a&s;hamed to &s;eem to notice it, yet he could not help a&s;king him, "To take a gla&s;s of wine."&mdash;He took it&mdash;and for once evinced he was reduced &s;o low, as to be <HI>glad</HI> of &s;uch a re&s;ource.</P>
<P>What pa&s;&s;ion thus agitated Lord Elmwood at this cri&s;is, it is hard to define.&mdash;Perhaps it was indigna|tion at Mi&s;s Milner's imprudence, and the &s;atisfac|tion he felt at being on the point of revenge&mdash;per|haps his emotion aro&s;e from joy, to find &s;he was &s;afe&mdash;perhaps it was perturbation at the regret he felt that he mu&s;t upbraid her&mdash;perhaps it was one alone of the&s;e &s;en&s;ations, but mo&s;t probably, it was them all combined.</P>
<P>She, wearied out with the tedious night's di&s;&s;ipa|tion, and le&s;s joyous than melancholy, had fallen a&s;leep as &s;he rode home, and when the carriage &s;topt, came half a&s;leep out of it.&mdash;"Light me to my bed-chamber in&s;tantly," &s;aid &s;he to her woman,
<PB N="171" REF="025650_0174_0FCEB20A8205CAB0">
who waited in the hall to receive her.&mdash;But one of Lord Elmwood's valets went up to her, and an|&s;wered, "Madam, my lord de&s;ires to &s;ee you be|fore you go to bed."</P>
<P>"Your lord, man?" cried &s;he, "Is he not out of town?"</P>
<P>"No, madam, my lord has been at home ever &s;ince you went out, and has been &s;itting up with Mr. Sandford, waiting for your return."</P>
<P>She was wide awake in&s;tantly.&mdash;The heavine&s;s was removed from her eyes, but fear, grief, and &s;hame &s;eized upon her heart.&mdash;She leaned again&s;t her woman, as if unable to &s;upport her&s;elf under tho&s;e feelings, and &s;aid to Mi&s;s Woodley:</P>
<P>"Make my excu&s;e&mdash;I can't &s;ee him to-night&mdash;I am unfit&mdash;indeed I cannot."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley was alarmed at the thought of going to him by her&s;elf, and thus perhaps aggra|vating him &s;till more; &s;he therefore &s;aid, "He has &s;ent for you; for heaven's &s;ake, do not di&s;obey him a &s;econd time."</P>
<P>"No, dear madam," cried her woman, "for he is like a lion&mdash;he has been &s;colding me."</P>
<P>"Good God!" exclaimed Mi&s;s Milner, (and in a tone that &s;eemed pathetic) "Then he is not to be my hu&s;band, after all."</P>
<P>"Yes," cried Mi&s;s Woodley, "if you will only be humble, and appear &s;orry.&mdash;You know your power over him, and all may yet be well."</P>
<P>She turned her &s;peaking eyes upon her friend, the tears &s;tarting from them, her lips trembling; "Do I not appear &s;orry?" &s;he cried.</P>
<P>The bell at that moment rung furiou&s;ly, and they mended their pace to the door of the apartment where his lord&s;hip was.</P>
<P>"No, this is only fright,"&mdash;replied Mi&s;s Wood|ley, "Say to him you are &s;orry, and beg his par|don."</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="025650_0175_0FCE9F1048ADBDA0">
"I cannot," &s;aid &s;he, "if Mr. Sandford is with him."</P>
<P>The &s;ervant opened the door, and &s;he and Mi&s;s Woodley went in.&mdash;Lord Elmwood by this time was compo&s;ed, and received her with a &s;light in|clination of his head; &s;he bowed to him in return, and &s;aid, with &s;ome marks of humility,</P>
<P>"I &s;uppo&s;e, my lord, I have done wrong."</P>
<P>"You have indeed, Mi&s;s Milner; an&s;wered he, "but do not &s;uppo&s;e, I mean to upbraid you; I am, moreover, going to relea&s;e you from any &s;uch apprehen&s;ion <HI>for the future.</HI>"</P>
<P>Tho&s;e la&s;t three words he &s;poke with a counte|nance &s;o &s;erious and &s;o determined, with an accent &s;o firm and &s;o decided, they pierced through her heart.&mdash;She did not however weep, or even &s;igh; but her friend, Mi&s;s Woodley, knowing what &s;he felt, exclaimed, "Oh!" as if for her.</P>
<P>She her&s;elf &s;trove with her angui&s;h, and replied, (but with a faultering voice) "I expect as much, my lord."</P>
<P>"Then, madam, you may perhaps expect all that I intend?"</P>
<P>"In regard to my&s;elf," &s;he replied, "I &s;uppo&s;e I do."</P>
<P>"Then," &s;aid he, "you may expect in a few days we &s;hall part."</P>
<P>"I am prepared for it, my lord," &s;he an&s;wered, and while &s;he &s;aid &s;o, &s;unk upon a chair.</P>
<P>"My lord, what you have to &s;ay farther," &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley, in tears, "defer till the morning. Mi&s;s Milner, you &s;ee, is not able to bear it now."</P>
<P>"I have nothing to &s;ay farther," replied he, coolly, "I have now only to act."</P>
<P>"Lord Elmwood," cried Mi&s;s Milner, divided between grief and anger, "you think to frighten me by your menaces, but I can part with you; heaven
<PB N="173" REF="025650_0176_0FCEB20B7861B740">
knows I can&mdash;your late behaviour has reconciled me to a &s;eparation."</P>
<P>On this he was going out of the room&mdash;but Mi&s;s Woodley, catching hold of him, cried, "Oh! my lord, do not leave her in this &s;orrow&mdash;pity her weakne&s;s, and forgive it."&mdash;She was proceeding, and he &s;eemed inclined to li&s;ten to her, when Sand|ford called out in &s;o &s;harp a tone,</P>
<P>"Mi&s;s Woodley, what do you mean?" &s;he gave a &s;tart, and de&s;i&s;ted.</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip turned to Sandford and &s;aid, "Nay, Mr. Sandford, you need entertain no doubts of me; I have judged, and have deter&mdash;"</P>
<P>He was going to &s;ay determined; but Mi&s;s Mil|ner, who dreaded to hear the word, interrupted the period, and exclaimed, "Oh! could my poor father know the grief, the days of &s;orrow, I have experienced &s;ince his death, how would he repent his fatal choice in a protector!"</P>
<P>This &s;entence, wherein his friend's memory was recalled, with the additional allu&s;ion to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> and &s;ecret affection for him&s;elf, affected Lord Elm|wood much&mdash;he was moved, but a&s;hamed of being &s;o; and as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, conquered the propen|&s;ity.&mdash;Yet, for a &s;hort interval, he did not know whether to go out of the room or to remain in it; whether to &s;peak or to be &s;ilent.&mdash;At length he turned towards her and &s;aid,</P>
<P>"Appeal to your father in &s;ome other form, in that (pointing to her dre&s;s) he will not know you.&mdash;Reflect upon him too in your moments of di&s;|&s;ipation, and let his idea controul your indi&s;creti|ons&mdash;not merely in an hour of contradiction call peevi&s;hly upon his name, only to wound the deare&s;t friend you have."</P>
<P>There was a degree of truth, and a degree of feeling, in the conclu&s;ion of this &s;peech, that a|larmed

Sandford, and he caught up one of the candles, and laying hold of his lord&s;hip's elbow, drew him out of the room, crying, "Come, my lord, come to your bed-chamber, it is very late&mdash;it is morning&mdash;it is time to ri&s;e." And by a con|tinual repetition of the&s;e words, in a very loud voice, drowned whatever his lord&s;hip, or any other per&s;on, might have wi&s;hed to have &s;poken or heard.&mdash;In this manner, Lord Elmwood was taken out of the apartment, and the evening's entertainment concluded.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXVII.</HEAD>
<P>TWO whole days pa&s;&s;ed in the bittere&s;t &s;u&s;|pen&s;e on the part of Mi&s;s Milner, while neither one word or look from Lord Elmwood, de|noted the mo&s;t trivial change of tho&s;e &s;entiments he had declared on the night of the ma&s;querade.&mdash;Still tho&s;e &s;entiments, or intentions, were not ex|plicitly delivered; they were more like intimations, than &s;olemn declarations&mdash;for though he had &s;aid, "He would never reproach her <HI>for the future,</HI>" and that "&s;he might expect they &s;hould part," he had not po&s;itively &s;aid they &s;hould; and upon this doubtful meaning of his words, &s;he hung with the &s;tronge&s;t agitation of hope, and of fear.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley &s;eeing the di&s;tre&s;s of her mind, (much as &s;he endeavoured to conceal it) entreated, nay implored, of her, to permit her to be a me|diator; to &s;uffer her to a&s;k for a private interview with Lord Elmwood, and provided &s;he found him inflexible, behave with a proper degree of &s;pirit in return; but if he appeared not ab&s;olutely aver&s;e to a reconciliation, to offer it to him in &s;o cautious a

manner, it might take place without farther unea&s;i|ne&s;s on either &s;ide. But Mi&s;s Milner peremptorily forbad this, and acknowledging to her friend every weakne&s;s &s;he felt on the occa&s;ion, yet concluded with &s;olemnly declaring, "That after what had pa&s;&s;ed between her and Lord Elmwood, <HI>he</HI> mu&s;t be the fir&s;t to make a conce&s;&s;ion, before &s;he her&s;elf would conde&s;cend to be reconciled."</P>
<P>"I believe, I know Lord Elmwood's temper," replied Mi&s;s Woodley, "and I do not think he will be ea&s;ily induced to beg pardon for a fault, which he thinks you have committed."</P>
<P>"Then he does not love me."</P>
<P>"P&s;haw! Mi&s;s Milner, this is the old argu|ment.&mdash;He may love you too well to &s;poil you&mdash;con|&s;ider he is your guardian as well as your lover, he means al&s;o to become your hu&s;band; and he is a man of &s;uch nice honour, he will not give you a &s;pecimen of that power before marriage, which he does not intend to &s;ubmit to hereafter."</P>
<P>"But tenderne&s;s, affection, the politene&s;s due from a lover to his mi&s;tre&s;s, demands this &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion; and as I now de&s;pair of enticing, I will oblige him to it&mdash;at lea&s;t I'll make the trial, and know my fate at once."</P>
<P>"What do you mean to do?"</P>
<P>"Invite my Lord Frederick to the hou&s;e, and a&s;k my guardian's con&s;ent for our immediate union; you will then &s;ee, what effect that has upon his pride."</P>
<P>"But you will then make it too late for him to be humble.&mdash;If you re&s;olve on this, my dear Mi&s;s Milner, you are undone at once&mdash;you may thus hurry your&s;elf into a marriage with a man you do not love, and the mi&s;ery of your whole future life may be the re&s;ult&mdash;Or, would you force Mr. Dor|riforth (I mean Lord Elmwood) to another duel with my Lord Frederick?"</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="025650_0179_0FCEB244AED94170">
"No, call him Dorriforth&mdash;" an&s;wered &s;he, with the tears &s;tealing from her eyes, "I thank you for calling him &s;o; for by that name alone, is he dear to me."</P>
<P>"Nay, Mi&s;s Milner, with what rapture did you not receive his love, as Lord Elmwood?"</P>
<P>"But under that title he has been barbarous; under the fir&s;t, he was all friend&s;hip and tender|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding Mi&s;s Milner indulged her&s;elf in all tho&s;e &s;oft bewailings to her friend&mdash;before Lord Elmwood &s;he maintained a degree of pride and &s;teadine&s;s which &s;urpri&s;ed even him, who had per|haps ever thought le&s;s of her love for him, than any other per&s;on.&mdash;She now began to fear &s;he had gone too far in di&s;covering her affection, and re|&s;olved to make trial of a contrary method.&mdash;She determined to retrieve that haughty character which had in&s;pired &s;o many of her admirers with pa&s;&s;ion, and take the chance of the effect upon this only one, to whom &s;he ever acknowledged a mutual love.&mdash;But although &s;he acted this character well&mdash;&s;o well, that every one but Mi&s;s Woodley thought her in earne&s;t&mdash;yet, with the nice&s;t and mo&s;t at|tentive anxiety, did &s;he watch even the &s;lighte&s;t circum&s;tance, that might revive her hopes, or con|firm her de&s;pair. Lord Elmwood's behaviour was calculated to produce the latter&mdash;he was cold, po|lite, and perfectly indifferent.&mdash;Yet, whatever his manners now were, they did not remove from her recollection what they had been&mdash;&s;he recalled, with delight, the ardour with which he had fir&s;t declared his pa&s;&s;ion to her, and the thou&s;and proofs he had &s;ince given of its reality.&mdash;From the con&s;tancy of his di&s;po&s;ition, &s;he depended a great deal, that tho&s;e &s;entiments were not totally eradicated; and from the extreme de&s;ire, which Mr. Sandford now, more than ever, di&s;covered to depreciate her in his pa|tron's

<P>But the re&s;erve, and indifference &s;he had &s;o well a&s;&s;umed for a few days, and which might, perhaps, have effected her de&s;igns, &s;he had not the patience to per&s;evere in, without calling levity to their aid.&mdash;She vi&s;ited repeatedly without &s;aying where, or with whom&mdash;kept later hours than u&s;ual&mdash;appeared in the highe&s;t &s;pirits; &s;ung, laugh'd, and never heaved a &s;igh, but when &s;he was alone.</P>

<P>Mi&s;s Woodley was extremely unea&s;y, and with cau&s;e; &s;he &s;aw her friend was providing her&s;elf with a weight of cares, &s;he would &s;oon find too much for her &s;trength to bear&mdash;&s;he would have rea&s;oned with her, but all her arguments had long &s;ince proved unavailing.&mdash;She &s;trongly wi&s;hed to &s;peak to Lord Elmwood upon the &s;ubject, and (un|knowing to her) plead her excu&s;e; but he appre|hended Mi&s;s Woodley's intention, and evidently &s;hunned her.&mdash;Mr. Sandford was now the only per|&s;on to whom &s;he could &s;peak of Mi&s;s Milner, and the delight he took to expatiate on her faults, was more &s;orrow to her friend, than not to &s;peak of her at all. She, therefore, &s;at a &s;ilent &s;pectator, waiting with dread for that time, when &s;he, who now &s;corned her advice, would fly to her in vain for comfort.</P>
<P>Sandford had, however, &s;aid one thing to Mi&s;s Woodley, which gave her a ray of hope. During their conver&s;ation on this &s;ubject (not by way of con&s;olation to her, but as a reproach to Lord Elm|wood),
<PB N="178" REF="025650_0181_0FCEB24601ED7FF0">
he one day angrily exclaimed, "And yet, notwith&s;tanding all his provocation, he has not come to the determination to think no more of her&mdash;he lingers and he&s;itates&mdash;I never &s;aw him &s;o weak upon any occa&s;ion before."</P>
<P>This was joyful hearing to Mi&s;s Woodley; &s;till, &s;he could not but reflect, the longer he was in com|ing to this determination, the more irrevocable it would be, when once taken; and every moment &s;he pa&s;&s;ed, &s;he trembled le&s;t that &s;hould be the moment, in which Lord Elmwood re&s;olved to bani&s;h Mi&s;s Mil|ner from his heart.</P>
<P>Among the unpardonable indi&s;cretions, &s;he was guilty of during this trial upon the temper of her guardian, was the frequent mention of many gen|tlemen, who had been her profe&s;t admirers, and mentioning them with partiality.&mdash;Tea&s;ed, if not tortured by this, Lord Elmwood &s;till behaved with a manly evenne&s;s of temper, and neither appeared provoked on the &s;ubject, or in&s;olently carele&s;s.&mdash;In a &s;ingle in&s;tance, however, this calmne&s;s had nearly de&s;erted him.</P>
<P>Entering the drawing-room, one evening, he &s;uddenly &s;tarted on &s;eeing Lord Frederick Lawn|ley there, in earne&s;t conver&s;ation with Mi&s;s Milner.</P>
<P>Mr. Horton and Mi&s;s Woodley were indeed pre|&s;ent, and Lord Frederick was talking in an audible voice, and upon &s;ome indifferent &s;ubjects; but with that impre&s;&s;ive manner, in which a man never fails to &s;peak to the woman he loves, be the &s;ubject what it will.&mdash;The moment Lord Elmwood &s;tarted, which was the moment he entered, Lord Fred<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ick aro&s;e.</P>
<P>"I beg your pardon, my lord," &s;aid Lord Elm|wood, "I prote&s;t I did not know you."</P>
<P>"I ought to entreat your lord&s;hip's pardon," re|turned Lord Frederick, "for this intru&s;ion, which an accident alone has occa&s;ioned. Mi&s;s Milner has
<PB N="179" REF="025650_0182_0FCEB2126718CA00">
been nearly overturned, by the carele&s;sne&s;s of a lady's coachman, in who&s;e carriage &s;he was, and therefore &s;uffered me to bring her home in mine."</P>
<P>"I hope you are not hurt," &s;aid Lord Elmwood to Mi&s;s Milner, but his voice was &s;o much affected, by what he felt, he could &s;carcely articulate the words.&mdash;Not with the apprehen&s;ion &s;he was hurt, was he thus agitated, for the gaiety of her manner convinced him that could not be the ca&s;e, nor did he indeed &s;uppo&s;e any accident, &s;uch as was men|tioned, had occurred; but the circum&s;tance of un|expectedly &s;eeing Lord Frederick had taken him off his guard, and being totally unprepared, he could not conquer tho&s;e &s;igns of &s;urpri&s;e, and the &s;hock it had given him.</P>
<P>Lord Frederick, who had heard nothing of his intended union with his ward, (for it was even kept a &s;ecret, at pre&s;ent, from every &s;ervant in the hou&s;e) imputed this di&s;compo&s;ure, to the per&s;onal re&s;ent|ment his lord&s;hip might bear him, in con&s;equence of their duel; for, notwith&s;tanding Lord Elmwood had a&s;&s;ured the uncle of Lord Frederick, (who once waited upon him on the &s;ubject of Mi&s;s Milner) that all re&s;entment was, on his part, entirely at an end; and that he was willing to con&s;ent to the la|dy's marriage with his nephew, if &s;he her&s;elf would concur, yet Lord Frederick doubted the &s;incerity of this, and would &s;till have had the delicacy not to have entered his lord&s;hip's hou&s;e, but, encou|raged by Mi&s;s Milner, and emboldened by his love. Per&s;onal re&s;entment was then the con&s;truction he put upon Lord Elmwood's emotion on entering the room, but Mi&s;s Milner and Mi&s;s Woodley knew his agitation to ari&s;e from a far different cau&s;e.</P>
<P>After his entrance, Lord Frederick did not at|tempt to re&s;ume his &s;eat, but bowing mo&s;t re&s;pect|fully to all pre&s;ent, took his leave; while Mi&s;s Mil|ner followed him, as far as the door, repeating her
<PB N="180" REF="025650_0183_0FCEB2477300DAB0">
thanks and gratitude for his protection.</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood was hurt beyond mea&s;ure; but he had a &s;econd concern, and that was, he had not the power to conceal how much he was affected.&mdash;He trembled&mdash;when he attempted to &s;peak, he &s;tam|mered&mdash;he perceived his face burning with the blood that had flu&s;hed to it from confu&s;ion, and thus one confu&s;ion gave birth to another, till his &s;tate was pitiable.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner with all her a&s;&s;umed gaiety and real in&s;olence, had not, however, the in&s;olence to &s;eem to ob&s;erve his &s;ituation; &s;he had only the confidence to ob&s;erve it by &s;tealth.&mdash;And Mrs. Horton and Mi&s;s Woodley, having opportunely begun a di&s;|cour&s;e upon &s;ome trivial occurrences, gave him time to recover him&s;elf by degrees&mdash;yet, &s;till it was merely by degrees, for the impre&s;&s;ion this incident had made, was deep, and not ea&s;ily to be era&s;ed.&mdash;The entrance of Mr. Sandford, who knew nothing of what had happened, was al&s;o &s;ome relief, and his lord&s;hip and he entered into conver&s;ation, which they very &s;oon retired into the library to terminate.&mdash;Mi&s;s Milner, taking Mi&s;s Woodley with her, went directly to her own apartment, and there exclaimed to her friend, in rapture,</P>
<P>"He is mine&mdash;he loves me&mdash;and he is mine for ever."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley congratulated her upon believing &s;o, but confe&s;&s;ed, &s;he her&s;elf, "had her fears."</P>
<P>"What fears?" cried Mi&s;s Milner, "don't you perceive he loves me?"</P>
<P>"I do," &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley, "but that, I al|ways &s;uppo&s;ed; and, I think, if he loves you now, he has &s;till the good &s;en&s;e to know, he has cau&s;e to hate you."</P>
<P>"What has good &s;en&s;e to do with love?" re|turned Mi&s;s Milner, "If a lover of mine &s;uffers his under&s;tanding to get the better of his affection&mdash;"</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="025650_0184_0FCEB213C5BAFEC8">
And the &s;ame arguments were again going to be repeated, but Mi&s;s Woodley interrupted her, by requiring an explanation of her conduct, not in re&s;pect to her guardian, but to Lord Frederick; whom, at lea&s;t, &s;he mu&s;t allow, &s;he was treating with cruelty, if &s;he only made u&s;e of his affection, to &s;timulate that of Lord Elmwood's.</P>
<P>"By no means, my dear Mi&s;s Woodley,"&mdash;re|turned &s;he&mdash;"I have, indeed, done with my Lord Frederick from this day; and he has certainly given me the proof I wanted of Lord Elmwood's love; but then, I did not engage him to this, by the &s;malle&s;t degree of hope.&mdash;No, do not &s;u&s;pect me of that, while my heart was another's.&mdash;And I a&s;&s;ure you, &s;eriou&s;ly, it was from the circum&s;tance we de|&s;cribed, that he came with me home&mdash;yet, I mu&s;t own, that had I not had this de&s;ign upon Lord Elm|wood's jealou&s;y in idea, I would have walked on foot through the &s;treets, rather than have &s;uffered his rival's civilities.&mdash;But he pre&s;&s;ed his &s;ervices &s;o violently, and my Lady Evans (in who&s;e chariot I was, when the accident happened) pre&s;&s;ed me &s;o violently to accept them, that he cannot expect any farther meaning from my acquie&s;cence, than my own convenience."</P>

<P>After reading every &s;yllable of this letter, it dropped from Mi&s;s Milner's hands; but &s;he uttered not a word&mdash;There was, however, a palene&s;s in her face, a deadne&s;s in her eye, and a kind of pal&s;y over her frame, which Mi&s;s Woodley, who had &s;een her in every &s;tage of her unea&s;ine&s;s, never had &s;een before.</P>
<P>"I do not want to read the letter," &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley, "your looks tell me its contents."</P>

Scarce able to crawl, &s;he ro&s;e, and looked in the gla&s;s, as if to arrange her features, &s;o as to impo&s;e upon him: alas! this was of no avail; a &s;erenity of mind, could, alone, effect what &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ed.</P>
<P>"You mu&s;t endeavour," &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley, "to feel that di&s;po&s;ition, you wi&s;h to make appear."</P>
<P>"I will," replied &s;he, "I will feel a proper pride&mdash;and a proper &s;corn of this treatment."</P>
<P>And &s;o de&s;irous was &s;he to attain the appearance of the&s;e &s;entiments, &s;he made the &s;tronge&s;t efforts to calm her thoughts, in order to acquire it.</P>
<P>"I have but a few days to remain with him," &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to her&s;elf, "and we part for ever&mdash;in tho&s;e few days, it is not only my duty to obey his com|mands, or rather comply with his reque&s;t, but it is al&s;o my wi&s;h to leave upon his mind, an impre&s;|&s;ion, which may not add to the ill opinion he has formed of me, but, perhaps, &s;erve to dimini&s;h it.&mdash;If, in every other in&s;tance my conduct has been blameable, he &s;hall, at lea&s;t in this, acknowledge its merit.&mdash;The fate I have drawn upon my&s;elf, he &s;hall find I can be re&s;igned to; and he &s;hall be convinced, that the woman, of who&s;e weakne&s;s he has had &s;o many fatal proofs, is yet in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome fortitude&mdash;fortitude to bid him farewell with|out di&s;covering one affected, or one real pang, though her death &s;hould be the immediate con&s;e|quence."</P>
<P>Thus &s;he re&s;olved, and thus &s;he acted.&mdash;The &s;evere&s;t judge could not have arraigned her conduct from the day &s;he received Lord Elmwood's letter, to the day of his departure.&mdash;She had, indeed, in|voluntary weakne&s;&s;es, but none with which &s;he did not &s;truggle, and in general her &s;truggles were vic|torious.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t time &s;he &s;aw him after the receipt of his letter, was on the evening of the &s;ame day&mdash;&s;he had a little concert of amateurs in mu&s;ick, and
<PB N="187" REF="025650_0190_0FCEB21841969208">
was, her&s;elf, &s;inging and playing when he entered the room; the connoi&s;&s;eurs immediately perceived &s;he lo&s;t the tune, but Lord Elmwood was no con|noi&s;&s;eur in the art, and did not ob&s;erve it.</P>
<P>They occa&s;ionally &s;poke to each other during the evening, but the &s;ubjects were general&mdash;and though their manners every time they &s;poke, were perfectly polite, they were not tinctured with the &s;malle&s;t degree of familiarity.&mdash;To de&s;cribe his behaviour exactly, it was the &s;ame as his letter, polite, friendly, compo&s;ed, and re&s;olved.&mdash;Some of the company &s;taid &s;upper, which prevented the embarra&s;&s;ment that mu&s;t unavoidably have ari&s;en, had the family been by them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The next morning each breakfa&s;ted in their &s;e|parate apartments&mdash;more company dined with them, and in the evening, and at &s;upper, Lord Elmwood was from home.</P>
<P>Thus all pa&s;&s;ed on as peaceably as he had re|que&s;ted, and Mi&s;s Milner had not betrayed one par|ticle of frailty; when, the third day at dinner, &s;ome gentleman of his acquaintance being at table, one of them &s;aid,</P>
<P>"And &s;o, my lord, you ab&s;olutely &s;et off on Tue&s;day morning?"</P>
<P>This was Friday.</P>
<P>Sandford and he both replied at the &s;ame time, "Yes," and Sandford, but not Lord Elmwood, looked at Mi&s;s Milner when he &s;poke.&mdash;Her knife and fork gave a &s;udden &s;pring in her hand, but no other emotion witne&s;&s;ed what &s;he felt.</P>
<P>"Ay, Elmwood," cried another gentleman at table, "you'll bring home, I am afraid, a foreign wife, and that I &s;han't forgive."</P>
<P>"It is his errand abroad, I make no doubt," &s;aid another vi&s;itor.</P>
<P>Before his lord&s;hip could return an an&s;wer, Sand|ford cried, "And what objection to a foreigner for

a wife? do not crowned heads all marry foreigners? and who happier in the marriage &s;tate than &s;ome kings?"</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood directed his eyes to the &s;ide of the table, oppo&s;ite to that where Mi&s;s Milner &s;at.</P>
<P>"Nay," (an&s;wered one of the gue&s;ts, who was a country gentleman) "what do you &s;ay, ladies&mdash;do you think my lord ought to go out of his own nation for a wife?" and he looked at Mi&s;s Milner, for the reply.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley, unea&s;y at her friend's being thus forced to give an opinion upon &s;o delicate a &s;ubject, endeavoured to &s;atisfy the gentleman, by an&s;wering to the que&s;tion her&s;elf: "Whoever my Lord Elm|wood marries, Sir," &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley, "he, no doubt, will be happy."</P>
<P>"But what &s;ay you, young lady?" a&s;ked the gentleman, &s;till keeping his eyes on Mi&s;s Milner.</P>
<P>"That whoever his lord&s;hip marries, he <HI>de&s;erves</HI> to be happy," returned &s;he, with the utmo&s;t com|mand of her voice and looks; for Mi&s;s Woodley, by replying fir&s;t, had given her time to collect her|&s;elf.</P>
<P>The colour &s;lew to Lord Elmwood's face, as &s;he delivered this &s;hort &s;entence; and Mi&s;s Woodley flattered her&s;elf, &s;he &s;aw a tear &s;tart in his eye.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner did not look that way.</P>
<P>In an in&s;tant his lord&s;hip found means to change the &s;ubject, but that of his journey &s;till employed the conver&s;ation; and what hor&s;es, &s;ervants, and carriage he took with him, was minutely a&s;ked, and &s;o accurately an&s;wered either by him&s;elf or by Mr. Sandford, that Mi&s;s Milner, although &s;he had be|held her doom before, till now had received no cir|cum&s;tantial account of it&mdash;and as circum&s;tances add to, or dimini&s;h all we feel, hearing the&s;e things <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ld, encrea&s;ed the bitterne&s;s of their truth.</P>
<P>Soon after dinner, the ladies retired, and from

that time, though Mi&s;s Milner's behaviour &s;till con|tinued the &s;ame, yet her looks and her voice were totally altered&mdash;for the world, &s;he could not have looked cheerfully; for the world, &s;he could not have &s;poken with a &s;prightly accent; &s;he frequently began in one, but not three words had &s;he uttered, before her tones &s;unk into the flatte&s;t dejection.&mdash;Not only her colour, but her features became changed; her eyes lo&s;t their brilliancy, her lips &s;eemed to hang without the power of motion, her head drooped, and her dre&s;s was wholly neglected.&mdash;Con&s;cious of this di&s;tre&s;t appearance, and con|&s;cious of the weakne&s;s from whence it aro&s;e, it was her de&s;ire to hide her&s;elf from the only object &s;he could have wi&s;hed to have charmed.&mdash;Accordingly, &s;he &s;at alone, or with Mi&s;s Woodley in her own apartment, as much as was con&s;i&s;tent with that ci|vility her guardian had reque&s;ted, and which for|bade her from totally ab&s;enting her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley felt &s;o acutely the torments of her friend, that had not her rea&s;on told her the in|flexible mind of Lord Elmwood was fixed beyond her power to &s;hake, &s;he had ca&s;t her&s;elf at his feet, and implored the return of his affection and tender|ne&s;s, as the only means to &s;ave his once beloved ward from an untimely grave.

<P>If the conver&s;ation did not every day turn upon the &s;ubject of Lord Elmwood's departure&mdash;a con|ver&s;ation he evidently avoided him&s;elf&mdash;yet every

<P>She in&s;tantly &s;tifled her tears, and looked at him earne&s;tly, as if to imply, "What now, my lord?"</P>
<P>He only an&s;wered with a bow, which expre&s;&s;ed the&s;e words alone: "I beg your pardon." And immediately withdrew</P>
<P>Thus each under&s;tood the other's language, with|out either uttering a word.</P>
<P>The ju&s;t con&s;truction, which &s;he put upon his looks and behaviour upon this occa&s;ion, kept up her &s;pirits for &s;ome little time; and &s;he ble&s;&s;ed heaven, repeatedly, for the &s;ingular favour of &s;howing to her, clearly, by this accident, his negli|gence of her &s;orrows, his total indifference.</P>
<P>The next day was the eve of that, on which he was to depart&mdash;and the one on which &s;he was to bid adieu to Dorriforth, to her guardian, to Lord Elm|wood; to all her hopes at once.</P>
<P>The moment &s;he awoke on Monday morning, the recollection, that this was, perhaps, the la&s;t day &s;he was ever again to &s;ee him, &s;oftened all the re|&s;entment
<PB N="191" REF="025650_0194_0FCEB21CB5E21528">
his ye&s;terday's conduct had given birth to, and forgetting his au&s;terity, and all &s;he once term|ed, cruelties; &s;he now only remembered his friend|&s;hip, his anxious tenderne&s;s, and his love.&mdash;She was impatient to behold him, and promi&s;ed to her|&s;elf, for this la&s;t day, to neglect no one opportu|nity of being with him. For that purpo&s;e &s;he did not breakfa&s;t in her own room, as &s;he had done for &s;everal mornings before, but went into the break|fa&s;t-room, where all the family generally met.&mdash;She was rejoiced on hearing his voice as &s;he opened the door, yet the &s;ound made her tremble &s;o much, &s;he could &s;carcely totter to the table.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley looked at her as &s;he entered, and was never &s;o much &s;hocked at &s;eeing her; for never had &s;he yet &s;een her look &s;o ill.&mdash;As &s;he approach|ed, &s;he made an inclination of her head to Mrs. Horton, and then to her guardian, as was her cu&s;|tom, when &s;he fir&s;t &s;aw them in a morning&mdash;his lord&s;hip looked in her face as he bowed, then turned his eyes upon the fire place, rubbed his forehead, and began talking with Mr. Sandford.</P>
<P>Sandford, during breakfa&s;t, by accident, ca&s;t his eyes upon Mi&s;s Milner; his attention was caught by her deathly countenance, and he looked ear|ne&s;tly.&mdash;He then turned to Lord Elmwood to &s;ee if he was ob&s;erving her appearance&mdash;he was not&mdash;and &s;o much were her thoughts engaged on him alone, &s;he did not once perceive Sandford gazing at her.</P>
<P>Mrs. Horton after a little while ob&s;erved, "It was a beautiful morning."</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood &s;aid, "He thought he heard it rain in the night."</P>
<P>Sandford cried, "For his part he &s;lept too well to know." And then (una&s;ked) held a plate of bi&s;cuits to Mi&s;s Milner&mdash;it was the fir&s;t civility he had ever in his life offered her; &s;he &s;miled at the
<PB N="192" REF="025650_0195_0FCEB2574A766010">
whim&s;icality of the circum&s;tance, but took one in return for his attention.&mdash;He looked grave beyond his u&s;ual gravity, and yet not with his u&s;ual ill temper. She did not eat what &s;he had &s;o politely taken, but laid it down &s;oon after.</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood was the fir&s;t who ro&s;e from break|fa&s;t, and did not return to dinner.</P>
<P>At dinner, Mrs. Horton &s;aid, "She hoped his lord&s;hip would, however, favour them with his company at &s;upper."</P>
<P>To which Sandford replied, "No doubt, for you will hardly, any of you, &s;ee him in the morning; as we &s;hall be off by &s;ix, or &s;oon after."</P>
<P>Sandford was not going abroad with Lord Elm|wood, but was to go with him as far as Dover.</P>
<P>The&s;e words of his&mdash;"<HI>not &s;ee Lord Elmwood in the morning</HI>"&mdash;[never again to &s;ee him after this evening,] were like the knell of death to Mi&s;s Mil|ner.&mdash;She felt the &s;ymptoms of fainting, and ea|gerly &s;natched a gla&s;s of wine, which the &s;ervant was holding to Sandford, (who had called for wine) and drank a part of it&mdash;As &s;he returned the gla&s;s to the &s;ervant, &s;he began to apologize to Mr. Sandford for her &s;eeming rudene&s;s, but before &s;he could utter what &s;he meant, he &s;aid, good-naturedly, "Never mind&mdash;you are very welcome&mdash;I am glad you took it."&mdash;She looked at him to ob|&s;erve, whether he had really &s;poken kindly, or iro|nically; but before his countenance could &s;atisfy her, her thoughts were away from that trivial cir|cum&s;tance, and again fixed upon Lord Elmwood.</P>
<P>The moments &s;eemed tedious till he came home to &s;upper, and yet, when &s;he reflected for &s;o &s;hort a time the re&s;t of the evening would continue, &s;he wi&s;hed to defer the hour of his return, for months.&mdash;At ten o'clock he arrived, and at half after ten the family, without any vi&s;itor, met at &s;upper.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner had con&s;idered, that the period for
<PB N="193" REF="025650_0196_0FCEB21F052FFCD8">
her to counterfeit appearances, was dimini&s;hed now to a very &s;hort one; and &s;he rigorou&s;ly enjoined her&s;elf not to &s;hrink from that little which re|mained.&mdash;The certain end, that would be &s;o &s;oon put to this painful deception, encouraged her to &s;truggle through it with redoubled zeal; and this was but nece&s;&s;ary, as her weakne&s;s increa&s;ed.&mdash;She therefore li&s;tened, &s;he talked, and even &s;miled with the re&s;t of the company, nor did their vivacity &s;eem to ari&s;e from a much le&s;s compul&s;ive &s;ource than her own.</P>
<P>It was pa&s;t twelve, when Lord Elmwood looked at his watch, and ri&s;ing from his &s;eat, went up to Mrs. Horton, and taking her hand, &s;aid, "Till I &s;ee you again, madam, I &s;incerely wi&s;h you every happine&s;s."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner fixed her eyes upon the table before her.</P>
<P>"My lord," replied Mrs. Horton, "I &s;incerely wi&s;h you health and happine&s;s likewi&s;e."</P>
<P>He then went to Mi&s;s Woodley, and taking her hand, repeated much the &s;ame, as he had &s;aid to Mrs. Horton.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner now trembled beyond all power of concealment.</P>
<P>"My lord," replied Mi&s;s Woodley, a good deal affected, "I &s;incerely hope my prayers for your happine&s;s may be heard."</P>
<P>She and Mrs. Horton were both &s;tanding as well as his lord&s;hip; but Mi&s;s Milner kept her &s;eat, till his eye was turned upon her, and he moved &s;lowly towards her; &s;he then ro&s;e&mdash;and every one who was pre&s;ent attentive to what he would now &s;ay, and how &s;he &s;hould receive what he &s;aid, ca&s;t their eyes upon them, and li&s;tened with impatience.&mdash;They were all di&s;appointed&mdash;he did not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;yllable.&mdash;Yet he took her hand, and held it clo&s;ely
<PB N="194" REF="025650_0197_0FCEB258F05152E0">
between his.&mdash;He then bowed mo&s;t re&s;pectfully, and le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t her.</P>
<P>No, "I wi&s;h you well;&mdash;I wi&s;h you health and happine&s;s." No "Prayers for ble&s;&s;ings on her."&mdash;Not even the word "farewell," e&s;caped his lips&mdash;perhaps, to have attempted any of the&s;e, might have choaked his utterance.</P>
<P>She had behaved with fortitude the whole even|ing, and &s;he continued to do &s;o, till the moment he turned away from her.&mdash;Her eyes then over|flowed with tears, and in the agony of her mind, not knowing what &s;he did, &s;he laid her cold hand upon the per&s;on next to her&mdash;it happened to be Sandford; but not ob&s;erving it was him, &s;he gra&s;ped his hand with violence&mdash;yet he did not &s;natch it away, nor look at her with his wonted &s;everity.&mdash;And thus &s;he &s;tood, &s;ilent and motionle&s;s, while his lord&s;hip lighted a candle, he took from the &s;ide|board, bowed once more to all the company, and retired.</P>
<P>Sandford had &s;till Mi&s;s Milner's hand fixed upon his; and when the door was &s;hut after Lord Elm|wood, he turned his head to look in her face, and turned it with &s;ome marks of apprehen&s;ion for the grief he might find there.&mdash;She &s;trove to overcome that grief, and after a heavy &s;igh, &s;at down, as if re&s;igned to the fate to which &s;he was decreed.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of following Lord Elmwood, as u&s;ual, Sandford poured out a gla&s;s of wine, and drank it.&mdash;A general &s;ilence en&s;ued for near three minutes.&mdash;At la&s;t turning him&s;elf round on his &s;eat, towards Mi&s;s Milner, who &s;at like a &s;tatue of de&s;pair at his &s;ide, "Will you breakfa&s;t with us to-morrow?" &s;aid he.</P>
<P>She made no an&s;wer.</P>
<P>"We &s;han't breakfa&s;t before half after &s;ix," con|tinued he, "I dare &s;ay; and if you can ri&s;e &s;o early&mdash;why do."</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="025650_0198_0FCEB220A2F81660">
"Mi&s;s Milner," &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley, (for &s;he caught, eagerly, at the hope of her pa&s;&s;ing this night in le&s;s unhappine&s;s than &s;he had foreboded) "pray ri&s;e at that hour to breakfa&s;t; Mr. Sand|ford would not invite you, if he thought it would di&s;plea&s;e his lord&s;hip."</P>
<P>"Not I," replied Sandford churli&s;hly.</P>
<P>"Then de&s;ire her woman to call her," &s;aid Mrs. Horton to Mi&s;s Woodley.</P>
<P>"Nay, &s;he will be awake, I have no doubt," re|turned her niece.</P>
<P>"No;" replied Mi&s;s Milner, "&s;ince Lord Elm|wood has thought proper to take his leave of me; without even &s;peaking a word; by my own de&s;ire, never will I &s;ee him again." And here a flood of tears bur&s;t forth, as if her heart bur&s;t at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>"Why did not <HI>you</HI> &s;peak to <HI>him?</HI>" cried Sand|ford&mdash;"pray did you bid <HI>him</HI> farewell?&mdash;and I don't &s;ee why one is not as much to be blamed, in that re&s;pect, as the other."</P>
<P>"I was too weak to &s;ay, I wi&s;hed him happy;" cried Mi&s;s Milner, "but, Heaven is my witne&s;s, I do wi&s;h him &s;o from my &s;oul."</P>
<P>"And do you imagine, he does not wi&s;h you &s;o too?" cried Sandford.&mdash;"You &s;hould judge him by your own heart; and what you feel for him, imagine he feels for you, my dear."</P>
<P>Though "<HI>my dear</HI>" is a trivial phra&s;e, yet from certain people, and upon certain occa&s;ions, it is a phra&s;e of infinite comfort and a&s;&s;urance.&mdash;Mr. Sandford &s;eldom &s;aid "my dear" to any one; to Mi&s;s Milner never; and upon this occa&s;ion, and from him, it was an expre&s;&s;ion mo&s;t precious.</P>
<P>She turned to him with a look of gratitude; but as &s;he only looked, and did not &s;peak, he ro&s;e up, and &s;oon after &s;aid, with a friendly tone he had

&s;eldom &s;poken with in her pre&s;ence, "I &s;incerely wi&s;h you a good night."</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he was gone, Mi&s;s Milner ex|claimed, "However my fate may have been pre|cipitated by the unkindne&s;s of Mr. Sandford, yet, for that particle of concern he has &s;hown for me this night, I will always be grateful to him."</P>
<P>"Ay," cried Mrs. Horton, "good Mr. Sand|ford may &s;how his kindne&s;s now, without any dan|ger from its con&s;equences.&mdash;Now his lord&s;hip is going away for ever, he is not afraid of your &s;eeing him once again." And &s;he thought &s;he prai&s;ed him by this &s;ugge&s;tion.</P>

<P>WHEN Mi&s;s Milner retired to her bed|chamber, Mi&s;s Woodley went with her, nor would leave her the whole night&mdash;but in vain did &s;he per|&s;uade her to go to re&s;t, &s;he ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed; and declared &s;he would never, from that hour, indulge the &s;malle&s;t repo&s;e.&mdash;"The part I undertook to perform," cried &s;he, "is over; I will now, for my whole life, appear in my own character, and give a loo&s;e to the angui&s;h I endure."</P>
<P>As day-light &s;howed it&s;elf, "And yet I might &s;ee him once again," &s;aid &s;he. "I might &s;ee him within the&s;e two hours, if I plea&s;ed, for Mr. Sand|ford invited me."</P>
<P>"If you think, my dear Mi&s;s Milner," &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley, "that a &s;econd parting from Lord Elm|wood, would but give you a &s;econd agony, in the name of Heaven do not &s;ee him any more&mdash;but, if

you think your mind would be ea&s;ier, were you to bid each other adieu in a more direct manner than you did la&s;t night, let us go down and breakfa&s;t with him.&mdash;I'll go before, to prepare him for your reception&mdash;you &s;hall not unexpectedly &s;urpri&s;e him&mdash;and I will let him know, it is by Mr. Sandford's invitation you are coming."</P>
<P>She li&s;tened with a &s;mile to this propo&s;al, yet ob|jected to the indelicacy of her wi&s;hing to &s;ee him, after he had taken his leave&mdash;but as Mi&s;s Woodley, neverthele&s;s, perceived &s;he was inclined to infringe this delicacy, of which &s;he had &s;o proper a &s;en&s;e, &s;he ea&s;ily per&s;uaded her, it was impo&s;&s;ible for the mo&s;t &s;u&s;picious per&s;on (and Lord Elm|wood was far from &s;uch a character) to &s;uppo&s;e, that by paying him a vi&s;it at that period of time, could be with the mo&s;t di&s;tant idea of re|gaining his heart, or of altering one re&s;olution he had taken.</P>
<P>In this opinion, Mi&s;s Milner acquie&s;ced, yet &s;he had not the courage to come to the determination &s;he would go.</P>
<P>Day-light now no longer peeped; but &s;tared broad upon them.&mdash;Mi&s;s Milner went to the look|ing-gla&s;s, breathed upon her hands and rubbed them on her eyes; put &s;ome powder into her hair; yet &s;aid, after all, "I dare not &s;ee him again."</P>
<P>"You may do as you plea&s;e," &s;aid Mi&s;s Wood|ley, "but I will. I that have lived for &s;o many years under the &s;ame roof with him, and on the mo&s;t friendly terms, and he going away, perhaps, for the&s;e ten years, perhaps for ever; I &s;hould think it a di&s;re&s;pect not to &s;ee him to the la&s;t moment of his remaining in the hou&s;e."</P>
<P>"Then do you go," &s;aid Mi&s;s Milner, eagerly, "and if he &s;hould a&s;k for me, I will gladly come,

you know; but if he does not a&s;k for me, I will not&mdash;and pray do not deceive me"</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley gave her word not to deceive her; and &s;oon after, as they heard the &s;er|vants pa&s;s about the hou&s;e, and the clock had &s;truck &s;ix, Mi&s;s Woodley went to the breakfa&s;t-room.</P>
<P>She found Lord Elmwood there in his travelling-dre&s;s, &s;tanding pen&s;ively by the fire place&mdash;and, as he did not dream of &s;eeing her, he &s;tarted when &s;he entered, and with an appearance of alarm, &s;aid, "Dear Mi&s;s Woodley, what's the matter?"&mdash;&s;he replied, "Nothing, my lord; but I could not be &s;atisfied without &s;eeing your lord&s;hip once again, while I had it in my power."</P>
<P>"I thank you," he returned with a &s;igh, and the heavie&s;t and mo&s;t intelligent &s;igh &s;he ever heard him conde&s;cend to give.&mdash;She imagined, al&s;o, he looked as if he wi&s;hed to a&s;k how Mi&s;s Milner did, but would not allow him&s;elf the indulgence.&mdash;She was half inclined to mention her to him, and de|bating in her mind whether &s;he &s;hould or not, Mr. Sandford came into the room; &s;aying, as he entered,</P>
<P>"For Heaven's &s;ake, my lord, where did you &s;leep la&s;t night?"</P>
<P>"Why do you a&s;k?" &s;aid his lord&s;hip.</P>
<P>"Becau&s;e," replied Sandford, "I went into your bed-chamber but now, and I found your bed made.&mdash;You did not &s;leep there la&s;t night?"</P>
<P>"I have &s;lept no where;" an&s;wered his lord&s;hip, "<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ould not &s;leep&mdash;and having &s;ome papers to look over, and to ri&s;e early, I thought I might as well not go to bed at all."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley was plea&s;ed at the frank man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> in which he made this confe&s;&s;ion, and could not re&s;i&s;t the &s;trong impul&s;e to &s;ay, "You have done

ju&s;t then, my lord, like Mi&s;s Milner, for &s;he has not been in bed the whole night."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley &s;poke this in a negligent manner, and yet, Lord Elmwood echoed back the words with &s;olicitude and tenderne&s;s, "Has not Mi&s;s Milner been in bed the whole night?"</P>
<P>"If &s;he is up, why does &s;he not come and take &s;ome coffee?" &s;aid Sandford, as he began to pour it out.</P>
<P>"If &s;he thought it would be agreeable," returned Mi&s;s Woodley, "I dare &s;ay &s;he would" And &s;he looked at Lord Elmwood while &s;he &s;poke, though &s;he did not ab&s;olutely addre&s;s him; but he made no reply.</P>
<P>"Agreeable!" returned Sandford, angrily, "Has &s;he then a quarrel with any body here? or does &s;he &s;uppo&s;e any body here hears enmity to <HI>her?</HI>&mdash;Is &s;he not in peace and charity?"</P>
<P>"Yes," replied Mi&s;s Woodley, "that I am &s;ure &s;he is"</P>
<P>"Then bring her here directly.&mdash;Would &s;he have the wickedne&s;s to imagine we are not all friends with her?"</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley left the room, and found Mi&s;s Milner almo&s;t in de&s;pair, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould hear Lord Elmwood's carriage drive off before her friend's return."</P>
<P>"Did he &s;end for me?" were the words &s;he ut|tered as &s;oon as &s;he &s;aw her.</P>
<P>"Mr. Sandford did, in his pre&s;ence," returned Mi&s;s Woodley, "and you may go with the utmo&s;t decorum, or I would not tell you &s;o."</P>
<P>She required no prote&s;tations of this, but readily followed her beloved advi&s;er, who&s;e kindne&s;s never appeared in half the amiable light as at that mo|ment.</P>
<P>On entering the room through all the dead white
<PB N="200" REF="025650_0203_0FCE9F26FB2F8128">
of her complexion, &s;he blu&s;hed to a crim&s;on.&mdash;Lord Elmwood ro&s;e from his &s;eat, and brought a chair for her to &s;it down.</P>
<P>Sandford looked at her inqui&s;itively, then &s;ipped his tea, and &s;aid, "He never made tea to his own liking."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner took a cup, but had &s;carce &s;trength to hold it.</P>
<P>It &s;eemed but at a very &s;hort time they were at breakfa&s;t, when the carriage, that was to take his lord&s;hip away, drove to the door.&mdash;Mi&s;s Mil|ner &s;tarted at the &s;ound; &s;o did he; but &s;he had nearly dropped her cup and &s;aucer: on which Sandford took them out of her hand, &s;aying,</P>
<P>"Perhaps you had rather have coffee?"</P>
<P>Her lips moved, but he could not hear what &s;he &s;aid.</P>
<P>A &s;ervant came in, and told Lord Elmwood, "the carriage was at the door."</P>
<P>He replied, "Very well." But though he had breakfa&s;ted, he did not attempt to move.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, ri&s;ing bri&s;kly from his &s;eat, as if it was nece&s;&s;ary to go in ha&s;te, when he did go; he took up his hat, which he had brought with him into the room, and was turning to Mi&s;s Woodley to take his leave, when Sandford cried, "My lord, you are in a great hurry."&mdash;And then, as if he wi&s;hed to give poor Mi&s;s Milner every moment he could, added, (looking about) "I don't know where I have laid my gloves."</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip, after repeating to Mi&s;s Woodley his la&s;t night's farewell, now went up to Mi&s;s Mil|ner, and taking one of her hands, again held it between his, but &s;till without &s;peaking&mdash;while &s;he, unable to &s;uppre&s;s her tears as heretofore, &s;uffered them to fall in torrents.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="025650_0204_0FCEB278F8211C30">
"What is all this?" cried Sandford, going up to them in anger.</P>
<P>They neither of them replied, or changed their &s;ituation.</P>
<P>"Separate this moment,"&mdash;cried Sandford&mdash;"or re&s;olve never to be &s;eparated but by death."</P>
<P>The commanding and awful manner in which he &s;poke this &s;entence, made them both turn to him in amazement! and almo&s;t petrified with the &s;en|&s;ation his words had cau&s;ed.</P>
<P>He left them for a moment, and going to a &s;mall book-ca&s;e in one corner of the room, took out of it a book, and returning with it in his hand, &s;aid,</P>
<P>"Lord Elmwood, do you love this woman?"</P>
<P>"More than my life," replied his lord&s;hip, with the mo&s;t heart-felt accents.</P>
<P>He then turned to Mi&s;s Milner&mdash;"Can you &s;ay &s;ay the &s;ame by him?"</P>
<P>She &s;pread her hands over her eyes, and cried, "Oh, heavens!"</P>
<P>"I believe you <HI>can</HI> &s;ay &s;o;" returned Sandford, "and in the name of God, and your own happi|ne&s;s, &s;ince this is the ca&s;e, let me put it out of your power to part."</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood gazed at him with wonder! and yet, as if enraptured with the &s;udden appearance of a change in his pro&s;pects.</P>
<P>She &s;ighed with a trembling kind of extacy; while Sandford, with all the pomp and dignity of a clergyman in his official character, delivered the&s;e words:</P>
<P>"My lord, while I thought my coun&s;el might &s;ave you from the wor&s;t of misfortunes, conjugal &s;trife, I importuned you hourly; and &s;et forth your danger in the light it appeared to me.&mdash;But though old, and a prie&s;t, I can &s;ubmit to think I have been in an error; and I now firmly believe, it is for the
<PB N="202" REF="025650_0205_0FCE9F284E7EE448">
welfare of you both, to become man and wife.&mdash;My lord, take this woman's marriage vows; you can a&s;k no fairer promi&s;es of her reform; &s;he can give you none half &s;o &s;acred, half &s;o binding; and I &s;ee by her looks &s;he will mean to keep them.&mdash;"And, my dear," continued he, addre&s;&s;ing him|&s;elf to her, "act but under the dominion of tho&s;e vows, to a hu&s;band of &s;en&s;e and virtue, like him, and you will be all that I, him&s;elf, or even Heaven can de&s;ire.&mdash;Now then, Lord Elmwood, this mo|ment con&s;train her by &s;uch ties from offending you, &s;he &s;hall not <HI>dare</HI> to violate."</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood &s;truck his forehead in doubt and agitation; but &s;till holding her hand, he cried, "I cannot part from her."&mdash;Then feeling this reply as equivocal, he fell upon his knees, and cried, "Will you pardon my he&s;itation?&mdash;and will you, in marriage, &s;how me that tender love you have not &s;hown me yet?&mdash;and will you, in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing all my affections, bear with all my infirmi|ties!"</P>
<P>She rai&s;ed him from her feet, and by the ex|pre&s;&s;ion of her face, the tears with which &s;he bathed his hands, gave him confidence.</P>
<P>He turned to Sandford&mdash;then placing her by his own &s;ide, as the form of matrimony requires, gave this as a &s;ign for Sandford to begin the ceremony.&mdash;On which, he opened his book and married them.</P>
<P>While with a countenance&mdash;manner&mdash;and voice &s;o &s;erious, and &s;o fervent, did he perform the&s;e rites, that the idea of je&s;t, or even of lightne&s;s, was far from the mind of every one pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner, covered with &s;hame, &s;unk on the bo&s;om of Mi&s;s Woodley.</P>
<P>When the ring was wanting, Lord Elmwood &s;up|plied it with one from his own hand, but through|out all the re&s;t of the ceremony, appeared lo&s;t i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">

zealous devotion to Heaven&mdash;Yet, no &s;ooner was it fini&s;hed; than his thoughts &s;eemed to de&s;cend to this world.&mdash;He embraced his bride with all the tran&s;port of the fonde&s;t, happie&s;t bride-groom, and in raptures called her by the endearing name of, "wife."</P>
<P>"But &s;till, my lord," cried Sandford, "you are only married by your own church and con|&s;cience, not by your wife's; or by the law of the land; and let me advi&s;e you not to defer that marriage long, left in the time you di&s;|agree, and &s;he yet refu&s;e to become your legal &s;pou&s;e."</P>
<P>"I think there is danger," returned his lord&s;hip, "and therefore our &s;econd marriage mu&s;t take place to-morrow."</P>
<P>To this the ladies objected, and it was left to Sandford to fix their &s;econd wedding, as he had done their fir&s;t.&mdash;He, after con&s;ideration, gave four days interval.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley then recollected, (for every one el&s;e had forgot it) that the carriage was &s;till at the door to convey Lord Elmwood abroad.&mdash;It was of cour&s;e di&s;mi&s;&s;ed&mdash;and one of tho&s;e great incidents of delight Mi&s;s Milner that morning ta&s;ted, was to look out of the window, and &s;ee this very carriage drive from the door unoccupied.</P>
<P>Never was there a more rapid change from de&s;|pair to happine&s;s&mdash;to happine&s;s mo&s;t &s;upreme&mdash;than was that, which Mi&s;s Milner and Lord Elm|wood experienced within one &s;ingle hour.</P>
<P>The few days that intervened between this and their legal marriage, were pa&s;&s;ed in the delight|ful care of preparing for that happy day&mdash;yet, with all its delights inferior to the fir&s;t; when every joy was doubled by the expected &s;orrow.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, on that fir&s;t wedding-day, that joy|ful day, which re&s;tored her lo&s;t lover to her hopes

again; even on that <HI>very</HI> day, after the &s;acred ce|remony was over, Mi&s;s Milner&mdash;(with all the fears, the tremors, the &s;uper&s;tition of her &s;ex)&mdash;felt an excruciating &s;hock; when, looking on the ring Lord Elmwood had put upon her finger, in ha&s;te, when he married her, &s;he perceived it was a MOURNING RING.</P>

<P>Actuated by a wi&s;h, that the reflective reader may experience the &s;en&s;ation, which an attention to circum&s;tances &s;uch as the&s;e, mu&s;t cau&s;e; he is de&s;ired to imagine &s;eventeen years elap&s;ed, &s;ince he

has &s;een or heard of any of tho&s;e per&s;ons, who in the foregoing volume have been introduced to his acquaintance&mdash;and now, &s;uppo&s;ing him&s;elf at the period of tho&s;e &s;eventeen years, follow the &s;equel of their hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>To begin with the fir&s;t female object of this &s;tory.&mdash;The beautiful, the beloved Mi&s;s Milner&mdash;&s;he is no longer beautiful&mdash;no longer beloved&mdash;no longer&mdash;tremble while you read it!&mdash;no longer&mdash;virtuous.</P>
<P>Dorriforth, the pious, the good, the tender Dorriforth, is become a hard-hearted tyrant. The compa&s;&s;ionate, the feeling, the ju&s;t Lord Elmwood, an example of implacable rigour and inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley is grown old, but le&s;s with years than grief.</P>
<P>The child Ru&s;hbrook is become a man, and the apparent heir of Lord Elmwood's fortune; while his own daughter, his only child by his once adored Mi&s;s Milner, he refu&s;es ever to &s;ee again, in ven|geance to her mother's crimes.</P>
<P>The lea&s;t wonderful change, is the death of Mrs. Horton. Except</P>
<P>Sandford, who remains much the &s;ame as here|tofore.</P>
<P>We left Lady Elmwood in the la&s;t volume at the &s;ummit of human happine&s;s; a loving and beloved bride.&mdash;We begin this volume and find her upon her death-bed.</P>
<P>At thirty-five, her "Cour&s;e was run,"&mdash;a cour&s;e full of perils, of hopes, of fears, of joys, and at the end of &s;orrows; all exqui&s;ite of their kind, for exqui&s;ite were the feelings of her &s;u&s;ceptible heart.</P>
<P>At the commencement of this &s;tory, her father is de&s;cribed in the la&s;t moments of his life, with all his cares fixed upon her, his only child&mdash;how vain tho&s;e cares! how vain every precaution that was taken for her welfare! She knows, &s;he reflects

upon this; and yet, torn by that in&s;tinctive power which a parent feels, Lady Elmwood on her dying day has no worldly thought, but that of the fu|ture happine&s;s of <HI>her</HI> only child.&mdash;To every other pro&s;pect before her, "Thy will be done" is her continual exclamation; but where the mi&s;ery of her daughter pre&s;ents it&s;elf, the dying penitent would there, combat the will of heaven.</P>
<P>To &s;tate the progre&s;&s;ion by which vice gains a predominance in the heart, may be a u&s;eful le&s;&s;on; but it is one &s;o little to the &s;atisfaction of mo&s;t readers, that it is not meant to be related here, all the degrees of frailty by which Lady Elmwood fell; but in&s;tead of picturing every occa&s;ion of her fall, come briefly to the events that followed.</P>
<P>There are, neverthele&s;s, &s;ome articles under the former cla&s;s, which ought not to be entirely o|mitted.</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood, after four years pa&s;&s;ed in the mo&s;t perfect enjoyment of happine&s;s, the marriage &s;tate could give; after &s;eeing him&s;elf the father of a beautiful daughter, whom he loved with a ten|derne&s;s nearly equal to his love for her mother, Lord Elmwood was then under the indi&s;pen&s;able nece&s;&s;ity of leaving them both for a time in order to &s;ave from the depreciation of his &s;teward, a very large e&s;tate in the We&s;t-Indies. His voyage was tedious; his re&s;idence there from various accidents, prolonged from time to time, till near three years had at length pa&s;&s;ed away.&mdash;Lady Elmwood, at fir&s;t only unhappy, became at la&s;t provoked; and giving way to that impatient, irritable di&s;po&s;ition &s;he had &s;o &s;eldom governed, re&s;olved, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of his in|junctions, to divert the melancholy hours his ab|&s;ence cau&s;ed, by mixing in the gaye&s;t circles of London. His lord&s;hip at this time, and for many months before, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ad been detained abroad by a &s;e|vere
<PB N="210" REF="025650_0212_0FCE9F4B8C082B70">
and dangerous illne&s;s, which a too cautious fear of her unea&s;ine&s;s had prompted him to con|ceal; and &s;he received his frequent apologies for not returning, with a &s;u&s;picion and re&s;entment they were calculated, but not intended, to in&s;pire.</P>
<P>To violent anger, &s;ucceeded a degree of indiffer|ence &s;till more fatal&mdash;Lady Elmwood's heart was never formed for &s;uch a &s;tate&mdash;there, where all the pa&s;&s;ions tumultuous &s;trove by turns, one among them &s;oon found the means to occupy all vacancies&mdash;that one was love.&mdash;The dear object of her fonde&s;t, true&s;t affections, was away; and tho&s;e affections painted the time &s;o irk&s;ome that was pa&s;t; &s;o wea|ri&s;ome that, which was &s;till to come; &s;he flew from the pre&s;ent tedious &s;olitude, to the dangerous &s;o|ciety of one, who&s;e every care to charm her, could not repay her for a moment's lo&s;s of him, who&s;e ab&s;ence he &s;upplied.&mdash;Or if the delirium gave her a moment's recompen&s;e, what were her &s;ufferings and remor&s;e, when &s;he was awakened from the fleeting joy by the unexpected arrival of her hu&s;|band?&mdash;How happy, how tran&s;porting, had been that arrival a few months before!&mdash;As it had then been felicitous, it was now bitter&mdash;this word, how|ever, weakly expre&s;&s;es&mdash;Language affords none, to de&s;cribe Lady Elmwood's &s;en&s;ations on being told her Lord was arrived, and that nece&s;&s;ity only had &s;o long delayed his return.</P>
<P>Guilty, but not hardened in her guilt, her pangs, her &s;hame, were the more exce&s;&s;ive. She fled the place at his approach; fled his hou&s;e, never again to return to a habitation where he was the ma&s;ter. She did not, however, e&s;cape with her paramour, but eloped to &s;helter her&s;elf in the mo&s;t dreary re|treat; where &s;he partook of no one comfort from &s;ociety, or from life, but the &s;till unremitting friend|&s;hip of Mi&s;s Woodley.&mdash;Even her infant daughter &s;he left behind, nor would allow her&s;elf the con&s;o|lation
<PB N="211" REF="025650_0213_0FCEB2848BCCD020">
of her innocent, but reproachful, &s;miles&mdash;&s;he left her in her father's hou&s;e, that &s;he might be under his protection; parted with her, as &s;he thought for ever, with all the agonies that mothers part from their infant children: and yet even a mother &s;carcely can conceive how much more &s;harp tho&s;e agonies were, on beholding the child &s;ent after her, as the perpetual outca&s;t of its father.</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood's love to his lady had been extra|vagant&mdash;the effect of his hate was extravagant likewi&s;e. Beholding him&s;elf &s;eparated from her by a barrier never to be removed, he vowed, in the deep torments of his revenge, not to be reminded of her by one individual object; much le&s;s by one &s;o nearly allied to her as her child. To be&s;tow upon that his affections, would be, he imagined, &s;till in &s;ome &s;ort, to divide them with the mother.&mdash;Firm in his re&s;olution, the beautiful Matilda was, at the age of &s;ix years, &s;ent out of her father's hou&s;e, and received by her mother with the ten|derne&s;s, but with the angui&s;h, of tho&s;e parents, who behold their offspring vi&s;ited with the puni&s;h|ment due only to their own offences.</P>
<P>During this tran&s;action, which was performed by his lord&s;hip's agents at his command, he him&s;elf was engaged in an affair of &s;till weightier import|ance&mdash;that of life or death:&mdash;he determined upon his own death, or the death of the man who had wounded his honour and his happine&s;s. A duel with his old antagoni&s;t was the re&s;ult of this de|termination; nor was the Duke of Avon (before the decea&s;e of his father and elde&s;t brother, Lord Frederick Lawnly) backward to render all the &s;a|tisfaction that was required.&mdash;For it was no other than he, who&s;e love for Lady Elmwood had &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, and who&s;e art and indu&s;try left no means une&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">yed to perfect his de&s;igns;&mdash;No other than he, (who, next to Lord Elmwood, was ever of all
<PB N="212" REF="025650_0214_0FCE9F4D2CFA5010">
lovers mo&s;t prevalent in her heart,) to whom Lady Elmwood yielded her own and her hu&s;band's future peace, and gave to his vanity a prouder triumph, than if &s;he had never given her hand in preference to another. This triumph however was but &s;hort&mdash;a month only, after the return of Lord Elmwood, his Grace was called upon to an&s;wer for his con|duct, and was left upon the &s;pot where they met, &s;o maimed, and defaced with &s;cars, as never again to endanger the honour of a hu&s;band. As Lord Elmwood was inexorable to all accommodation; their engagement la&s;ted for &s;ome &s;pace of time; nor any thing but the &s;tedfa&s;t a&s;&s;urance that his opponent was &s;tain, could at la&s;t have torn his lord&s;hip from the field, though he him&s;elf was mor|tally wounded.</P>
<P>Yet even during that period of his danger, while for days he laid in the continual expectation of his own death, not all the entreaties of his deare&s;t, mo&s;t intimate, and mo&s;t re&s;pected friends, could prevail upon him to pronounce forgivene&s;s to his wife, or &s;uffer them to bring his daughter to him for his la&s;t ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>Lady Elmwood, who was made acquainted with the minute&s;t circum&s;tance as it pa&s;&s;ed, appeared to wait the news of her Lord's decea&s;e with patience; but upon her brow, and in every lineament of her face it was marked, his death was an event &s;he would not for a day &s;urvive&mdash;and &s;he had left her child an orphan, to have followed Lord Elmwood to the grave.&mdash;She was prevented the trial; he re|covered; and from the ample and di&s;tingui&s;hed vengeance he had obtained upon the irre&s;i&s;tible per|&s;on of the Duke, in a &s;hort time &s;eemed to regain his u&s;ual tranquillity.</P>
<P>He recovered, while Lady Elmwood fell &s;ick and lingered&mdash;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of youth and a good con&s;titution, &s;he lingered till ten years decline brought her to that

<HEAD>CHAPTER II.</HEAD>
<P>IN a lonely country on the borders of Scotland, a &s;ingle hou&s;e by the &s;ide of a dreary heath, was the re&s;idence of the once gay, volatile Mi&s;s Milner. In a large gloomy apartment of this &s;olitary habi|tation (the windows of which &s;carce rendered the light acce&s;&s;ible) was laid upon her death-bed, the once lovely Lady Elmwood&mdash;pale, half &s;uffocated with the lo&s;s of breath; yet her &s;en&s;es perfectly clear and collected, which &s;erved but to &s;harpen the angui&s;h of dying.</P>
<P>In one corner of the room, by the &s;ide of an old-fa&s;hioned &s;tool, kneels Mi&s;s Woodley, praying mo&s;t devoutly for her &s;till beloved friend, but in vain en|deavouring to pray compo&s;edly&mdash;floods of tears pour down her furrowed cheeks, and frequent &s;obs of &s;orrow break through each pious ejaculation.</P>
<P>Clo&s;e by her mother's &s;ide, one hand &s;upporting her head, the other wiping from her face the damp dew of death, behold Lady Elmwood's daughter&mdash;Lord Elmwood's daughter too&mdash;yet he far away, negligent of what either &s;uffers.&mdash;Lady Elmwood turns to her often, and attempts an embrace, but her feeble arms forbid, and they fall motionle&s;s.&mdash;The daughter perceiving the&s;e ineffectual efforts, has her whole face convul&s;ed with &s;orrow; ki&s;&s;es her mother; holds her to her bo&s;om; and hangs upon her neck, as if &s;he wi&s;hed to cling there, and the grave not to part them.</P>
<P>On the other &s;ide the bed &s;its Sandford&mdash;his hair
<PB N="214" REF="025650_0216_0FCE9F4E8A979BE0">
grown white&mdash;his face wrinkled with age&mdash;his heart the &s;ame as ever&mdash;The reprover, the enemy of the vain, idle, and wicked; but the friend, the comforter of the forlorn and mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>Upon tho&s;e features where &s;arca&s;m, reproach, and anger dwelt to threaten and alarm the &s;inner; mildne&s;s, tenderne&s;s, and pity beamed, to &s;upport and con&s;ole the penitent. Compa&s;&s;ion changed his language, and &s;oftened all tho&s;e har&s;h tones that u&s;ed to denounce re&s;entment.</P>
<P>"In the name of God," &s;aid he to Lady Elm|wood, "that God who &s;uffered for you, and &s;uf|fering, knew and pitied all our weakne&s;&s;es&mdash;By him, who has given his word, 'to take compa&s;&s;ion on the &s;inner's tears,' I bid you hope for mercy.&mdash;By that innocence in which you once lived, be com|forted&mdash;By the &s;orrows you have known &s;ince your degradation, hope, in &s;ome degree, to have atoned&mdash;By that &s;incerely which &s;hone upon your youth|ful face when I joined your hands; tho&s;e thou&s;and virtues you have at times given proof of, you were not born to die the death of the wicked."</P>
<P>As he &s;poke the&s;e words of con&s;olation, her trembling hand cla&s;ped his&mdash;her dying eyes darted a ray of brightne&s;s&mdash;but her failing voice endea|voured, in vain, to articulate.&mdash;At length, her eyes fixing upon her daughter as their la&s;t dear object, &s;he was ju&s;t under&s;tood to utter the word "Fa|ther."</P>
<P>"I under&s;tand you," replied Sandford, "and by all that influence I ever had over him, by my prayers, my tears," (and they flowed at the word) I will implore him to own his child."</P>
<P>She could now only &s;mile, in thanks.</P>
<P>"And if I &s;hould fail," continued he, "yet while I live, &s;he &s;hall not want a friend or protector&mdash;all an old man like me can an&s;wer for"&mdash;here his tears interrupted him.</P>

Lady Elmwood was &s;ufficiently &s;en&s;ible of his words and their import, to make a &s;ign as if &s;he wi&s;hed to embrace him; but finding her life leaving her fa&s;t, &s;he re&s;erved this la&s;t token of love for her daughter&mdash;With a &s;truggle &s;he lifted her&s;elf from her pillow, clung to her child&mdash;and died in her arms.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER III.</HEAD>
<P>LORD ELMWOOD was by nature, and more from education, of a &s;erious, thinking, and philo|&s;ophic turn of mind. His religious &s;tudies had completely taught him to con&s;ider this world but as a pa&s;&s;age to another; to enjoy with gratitude what Heaven in its bounty &s;hould be&s;tow, and to bear with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion all which in its vengeance it might inflict&mdash;In a greater degree than mo&s;t people, he practi&s;ed this doctrine; and as &s;oon as the fir&s;t &s;hock he received from Lady Elmwood's conduct was abated, an entire calmne&s;s and re&s;ignation en|&s;ued; but &s;till of that &s;en&s;ible and feeling kind, which could never force him to forget the happine&s;s he had lo&s;t; and it was this &s;en&s;ibility which urged him to fly from its more keen recollection as much as po&s;&s;ible&mdash;this he alledged as the rea&s;on he would never &s;uffer Lady Elmwood, or even her child, to be named in his hearing. But this injunction (which all his friends, and even the &s;ervants in the hou&s;e who attended his per&s;on, had received) was, by many people, &s;u&s;pected rather to proceed from his re&s;entment than his tenderne&s;s; nor did he him|&s;elf deny, that re&s;entment mingled with his pru|dence; for prudence he called it not to remind him|&s;elf
<PB N="216" REF="025650_0218_0FCE9FD508A082E8">
of happine&s;s he could never ta&s;te again, and of ingratitude that might impel him to hatred; and prudence he called it not to form another attach|ment near to his heart; more e&s;pecially &s;o near as a parent's, which might a &s;econd time expo&s;e him to all the torments of ingratitude, from one whom he affectionately loved.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e principles he formed the un&s;haken re&s;olution, never to acknowledge Lady Matilda as his child, or acknowledging her as &s;uch&mdash;never to &s;ee, hear of, or take no concern whatever in her fate and fortune. The death of her mother ap|peared a favourable time, had he been &s;o inclined, to have recalled this declaration which he had &s;o|lemnly and repeatedly made&mdash;&s;he was now de&s;titute of the protection of her other parent, and it be|came his duty, at lea&s;t to provide her a guardian, if he did not choo&s;e to take that tender title upon him&s;elf.&mdash;But to mention either the mother or child to Lord Elmwood, was an equal offence, and pro|hibited in the &s;tronge&s;t terms to all his friends and hou&s;hold; and as he was an excellent good ma&s;ter, a &s;incere friend, and a mo&s;t generous patron; not one of his acquaintance or dependants, were hardy enough to draw upon them&s;elves his certain di&s;plea|&s;ure, which was violent in the extreme, by even the official intelligence of Lady Elmwood's death.</P>
<P>Sandford him&s;elf, intimidated through age, or by the au&s;tere, and even moro&s;e, manners Lord Elmwood had of late years adopted; Sandford wi&s;hed, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;ome other would undertake the dangerous ta&s;k of recalling to his lord&s;hip's memory, there ever was &s;uch a per&s;on as his wife. He advi&s;ed Mi&s;s Woodley to indite a proper letter to him on the &s;ubject; but &s;he reminded him, &s;uch a &s;tep was &s;till more perilous in her, than any other per&s;on, as &s;he was the mo&s;t de&s;titute being on earth, without the benevolence of Lord Elmwood.

death of her aunt, Mrs. Horton, had left her &s;ole reliance on Lady Elmwood; and now her death had left her totally dependant upon the Earl&mdash;for her Lady&s;hip, long before her decea&s;e, had declared it was not her intention, to leave a &s;ingle &s;entence behind her in the form of a will&mdash;She had no will, &s;he &s;aid, but what &s;he would wholly &s;ubmit to Lord Elmwood's; and, if it were even his will, her child &s;hould live in poverty, as well as bani&s;hment, it &s;hould be &s;o. But, perhaps, in this implicit &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to his lord&s;hip, there was a di&s;tant hope that the nece&s;&s;itous &s;ituation of his daughter might plead more forcibly than his parental love; and that knowing her abandoned of every &s;upport but through him&s;elf, that idea might form &s;ome little tie between them; and be at lea&s;t a token of the relation&s;hip.</P>
<P>But as Lady Elmwood anxiou&s;ly wi&s;hed this prin|ciple upon which &s;he acted, &s;hould be concealed from his lord&s;hip's &s;u&s;picion, &s;he included her friend Mi&s;s Woodley in the &s;ame fate; and thus, the only per&s;ons dear to her, &s;he left, but at Lord Elm|wood's plea&s;ure, to be pre&s;erved from peri&s;hing in want.&mdash;Her child was too young to advi&s;e her on this &s;ubject, her friend too di&s;intere&s;ted; and at this moment they were both without the &s;malle&s;t means of &s;upport, except through the ju&s;tice or compa&s;&s;ion of his lord&s;hip.&mdash;Sandford had, indeed, promi&s;ed his protection to the daughter; but his liberality had no other &s;ource than from his patron, with whom he &s;till lived as u&s;ual, except during the winter when his lord&s;hip re&s;ided in town, he then mo&s;tly &s;tole a vi&s;it to Lady Elmwood&mdash;On this la&s;t vi&s;it, he &s;taid to &s;ee her buried.</P>
<P>After &s;ome mature deliberations, Sandford was now preparing to go to Lord Elmwood at his hou&s;e in town, and there to deliver him&s;elf the news that
<PB N="218" REF="025650_0220_0FCE9FD669F685F0">
mu&s;t &s;ooner or later be told; and he meant al&s;o to venture, at the &s;ame time, to keep the promi&s;e he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ad made to his dying lady&mdash;but the news reached Lord Elmwood before Sandford arrived; it was announced in the public papers, and by that means came fir&s;t to his knowledge.</P>
<P>He was breakfa&s;ting by him&s;elf, when the new&s;|paper that fir&s;t gave the intelligence of Lady Elm|wood's death, was laid before him&mdash;the paragraph contained the&s;e words:</P>
<Q>On Wedne&s;day la&s;t died, at Dring-Park, a vil|lage in Northumberland, the right honourable Counte&s;s Elmwood&mdash;This lady, who has not been heard of for many years in the fa&s;hionable world, was a rich heire&s;s, and of extreme beauty; but although &s;he received overtures from many men of the fir&s;t rank, &s;he preferred her guar|dian, the pre&s;ent Lord Elmwood (then the hum|ble Mr. Dorriforth) to them all&mdash;and it is &s;aid, they enjoyed an uncommon &s;hare of felicity, till his lord&s;hip going abroad, and remaining there &s;ome time, the con&s;equences (to a mo&s;t captivat|ing young woman left without a protector) were &s;uch, as to cau&s;e a &s;eparation on his return.&mdash;Her lady&s;hip has left one child, a daughter, a|bout fifteen.</Q>
<P>Lord Elmwood had &s;o much feeling upon reading this, as to lay down the paper, and not to take it up again for &s;everal minutes&mdash;nor did he ta&s;te his chocolate during this interval, but leaned his elbow on the table, and re&s;ted his head upon his hand&mdash;He then ro&s;e up&mdash;walked two or three times acro&s;s the room&mdash;&s;at down again&mdash;took up the paper&mdash;and read as u&s;ual.&mdash;Nor let the vociferous mourner, or the perpetual weeper, here complain of his want of &s;en&s;ibility&mdash;but let them remember Lord Elm|wood was a man&mdash;a man of under&s;tanding&mdash;of courage&mdash;of fortitude&mdash;with all, a man of the nice&s;t
<PB N="219" REF="025650_0221_0FCEB28C80960E10">
feelings&mdash;and who &s;hall &s;ay, but that at the time he leaned his head upon his hand, and ro&s;e to walk away the &s;en&s;e of what he felt, he might not feel as much as Lady Elmwood did in her la&s;t mo|ments?</P>
<P>Be this as it may, his lord&s;hip's &s;u&s;ceptibility on the occa&s;ion was not &s;u&s;pected by any one&mdash;he pa&s;&s;ed that day the &s;ame as u&s;ual; the next day too, and the day after.&mdash;On the morning of the fourth day, he &s;ent for his &s;teward to his &s;tudy, and after talking of other bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;aid to him,</P>
<P>"Is it true that Lady Elmwood is dead?"</P>
<P>"It is, my lord," replied the man.</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip looked unu&s;ually grave, and at this reply, fetched an involuntary &s;igh.</P>
<P>"Mr. Sandford, my lord," continued the &s;tew|ard, "&s;ent me word of the news, but left it to my own di&s;cretion, whether I made your lord&s;hip ac|quainted with it or not."</P>
<P>"Where is Sandford?" a&s;ked Lord Elmwood.</P>
<P>"He was with my lady," replied the &s;teward.</P>
<P>"When &s;he died?" a&s;ked his lord&s;hip.</P>
<P>"Yes, my lord."</P>
<P>"I am glad of it&mdash;he will &s;ee every thing &s;he de&s;ired done.&mdash;Sandford is a good man, and would be a friend to every body."</P>
<P>"He is a very good man indeed, my lord."</P>
<P>There was now a &s;ilence.&mdash;Mr. Giffard then bowing, &s;aid, "Has your lord&s;hip any further com|mands?"</P>
<P>"Write to Sandford," &s;aid Lord Elmwood, he|&s;itating as he &s;poke, "and tell him to have every thing performed as &s;he de&s;ired.&mdash;And whoever &s;he may have &s;elected for the guardian of her child, has my con&s;ent to act as &s;uch.&mdash;Nor in one in&s;tance, where I my&s;elf am not concerned, will I contradict her will."&mdash;The tears ru&s;hed to his eyes as he &s;aid
<PB N="220" REF="025650_0222_0FCEB25A357C3ED8">
this, and cau&s;ed them to &s;tart in the &s;teward's&mdash;ob|&s;erving which, he &s;ternly re&s;umed,</P>
<P>"Do not &s;uppo&s;e from this conver&s;ation, that any of tho&s;e re&s;olutions I have long &s;ince taken, are, or will be, changed&mdash;they are the &s;ame; and &s;hall continue the &s;ame&mdash;and your interdiction, Sir, (as well as every other per&s;on's) remains ju&s;t the &s;ame as formerly; never to mention this &s;ubject to me in future."</P>
<P>"My lord, I always obeyed you," replied Mr. Giffard, "and hope I always &s;hall."</P>
<P>"I hope &s;o too," replied his lord&s;hip, in a threatening accent&mdash;"Write to Sandford," conti|nued he, "to let him know my plea&s;ure, and that is all you have to do."</P>
<P>The &s;teward bowed and withdrew.</P>
<P>But before his letter arrived to Sandford, Sand|ford arrived in town; and Mr. Giffard related to him word for word, what had pa&s;&s;ed between him and his lord.&mdash;Upon every occa&s;ion, and upon every topic, except that of Lady Elmwood and her child, Sandford was ju&s;t as free with Lord Elmwood as he had ever been; and as u&s;ual (after his interview with the &s;teward) went into his lord&s;hip's apartment without any previous notice. He lord&s;hip &s;haked him by the hand as upon all other meetings; and yet, whether his fears &s;ugge&s;ted it or not, Sandford thought he appeared more cool and re&s;erved with him than common.</P>
<P>During the whole day, the &s;lighte&s;t mention of Lady Elmwood, or of her child, was cautiou&s;ly a|voided&mdash;and not till the evening, (after Sandford had rung for his candle to retire to re&s;t, it was brought, and he had wi&s;hed his lord&s;hip good night) did he dare to mention the &s;ubject.&mdash;He then, af|ter taking leave, and going to the door&mdash;turned back and &s;aid, "My lord,"&mdash;</P>
<P>It was ea&s;y to gue&s;s on what he was preparing to
<PB N="221" REF="025650_0223_0FCEB28DF8DDE838">
&s;peak&mdash;his voice failed, the tears began to trickle down his cheeks, he took out his handkerchief, and could proceed no farther.</P>
<P>"I thought," &s;aid Lord Elmwood, angrily, "I had given my orders upon this &s;ubject&mdash;did not my &s;teward write them to you?"</P>
<P>"He did, my lord," &s;aid Sandford, humbly, "but I was &s;et out before they arrived."</P>
<P>"Has he not <HI>told</HI> you my mind then?" cried his lord&s;hip, more angrily &s;till.</P>
<P>"He has;" replied Sandford,&mdash;"But"&mdash;</P>
<P>"But what, Sir?"&mdash;cried Lord Elmwood.</P>
<P>"Your lord&s;hip," continued Sandford, "was mi&s;taken in &s;uppo&s;ing Lady Elmwood left a will; &s;he left none."</P>
<P>"No will? no will at all?"&mdash;&s;aid his lord&s;hip, &s;urpri&s;ed.</P>
<P>"No, my lord," an&s;wered Sandford, "&s;he wi&s;hed every thing to be as you willed."</P>
<P>"She left me all the trouble, then, you mean?"</P>
<P>"No great trouble, Sir; for except two per&s;ons, her lady&s;hip has not left any one el&s;e to hope for your protection"</P>
<P>"And who are the&s;e two?" cried he ha&s;tily.</P>
<P>"One, my lord, I need not name&mdash;the other is Mi&s;s Woodley."</P>
<P>There was a delicacy and an humility, in the manner in which Sandford delivered this reply, that Lord Elmwood could <HI>not</HI> re&s;ent, and he only re|turned,</P>
<P>"Mi&s;s Woodley, is &s;he yet living?"</P>
<P>"She is&mdash;I left her at the hou&s;e I came from."</P>
<P>"Well, then," an&s;wered his lord&s;hip, "you mu&s;t &s;ee that my &s;teward provides for tho&s;e two per|&s;ons.&mdash;That care I leave to you&mdash;and &s;hould there be any complaints, on you they fall."</P>
<P>Sandford bowed and was going.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="025650_0224_0FCEB25E020F4478">
"And now," re&s;umed his lord&s;hip, in a &s;tern and exalted voice, "let me <HI>never</HI> hear again on this &s;ubject.&mdash;You have full power to act in regard to the per&s;ons you have mentioned; and upon you their &s;ituation, their care, their whole management depend&mdash;but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;ure, you never let them be named before me, from this moment."</P>
<P>"Then," &s;aid Sandford, "as this mu&s;t be the la&s;t time they are mentioned, I mu&s;t now take the opportunity to di&s;burden my mind of a charge"&mdash;</P>
<P>"What charge?"&mdash;cried his lord&s;hip, moro&s;ely interrupting him.</P>
<P>"Though Lady Elmwood, my lord, left no will behind, &s;he left a reque&s;t."</P>
<P>"Reque&s;t"&mdash;&s;aid his lord&s;hip, &s;tarting&mdash;"If it is for me to &s;ee her daughter, I tell you now before you a&s;k, I will not grant it&mdash;for by heaven (and he &s;poke and looked mo&s;t &s;olemnly) though I have no re&s;entment to the innocent child; and wi&s;h her happy, yet I will never &s;ee her&mdash;Never, for her mo|ther's &s;ake, &s;uffer my heart to be again &s;oftened by an object I might doat on.&mdash;Therefore, Sir, if that is the reque&s;t, it is already an&s;wered; my will is fixed."</P>
<P>"The reque&s;t, my lord," replied Sandford, (taking out a pocket-book from whence he drew &s;e|veral papers) "is contained in this letter; nor do I rightly know what its contents are."&mdash;And he held it out to him.</P>
<P>"Is it Lady Elmwood's writing?" cried his lord|&s;hip, extremely di&s;compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>"It is, my lord&mdash;She called for ink and paper, and wrote it a few days before &s;he died, and en|joined me to deliver it to you, with my own hands."</P>
<P>"I refu&s;e to read it,"&mdash;cried he, putting it from him&mdash;and trembling while he did &s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="025650_0225_0FCEB28F88258A70">
"She de&s;ired me," &s;aid Sandford, (&s;till pre&s;ent|ing the letter) "to conjure you to read it, <HI>for her father's &s;ake.</HI>"</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood took it in&s;tantly.&mdash;But as &s;oon as it was in his hand, he &s;eemed di&s;tre&s;&s;ed to know what he &s;hould do with it&mdash;in what place, to go to read it&mdash;or how fortify him&s;elf again&s;t its contents.&mdash;He appeared a&s;hamed too, that he had been &s;o far prevailed upon, and &s;aid, by way of excu&s;e,</P>
<P>"For Mr. Milner's &s;ake I would do much&mdash;nay, any thing, but that to which, I have ju&s;t now &s;worn never to con&s;ent.&mdash;For his &s;ake I have borne a great deal&mdash;for his &s;ake alone, his daughter died my wife.&mdash;You know, no other motive than re&s;pect for him, prevented my divorcing her.&mdash;Pray (and he he&s;itated) was &s;he buried with him?"</P>
<P>"No, my lord&mdash;&s;he expre&s;&s;ed no &s;uch de&s;ire; and as that was the ca&s;e, I did not think it nece&s;&s;ary to carry the corp&s;e &s;o far."</P>
<P>At the word corp&s;e, Lord Elmwood &s;hrunk, and looked &s;hocked beyond mea&s;ure&mdash;but recovering him&s;elf, &s;aid, "I am &s;orry for it;&mdash;for he loved <HI>her</HI> &s;incerely, if &s;he did not love him&mdash;and I wi&s;h they had been buried together."</P>
<P>"It is not then too late," &s;aid Sandford, and was going on&mdash;but his lord&s;hip interrupted him.</P>
<P>"No, no&mdash;we will have no di&s;turbing of the dead."</P>
<P>"Read her letter then," &s;aid Sandford, "and bid her re&s;t in peace."</P>
<P>"If it is in my power," returned his lord&s;hip, "to grant what &s;he a&s;ks, I will&mdash;but if her de|mand is what I apprehend, I cannot, I will not bid her re&s;t by complying&mdash;You know my re&s;olu|tion, and my di&s;po&s;ition, and take care how you provoke me.&mdash;You may do an injury to the very per&s;on you are &s;eeking to befriend&mdash;the very main|tenance

<P>Poor Sandford, all alarm at this menace, replied with energy, "My lord, unle&s;s you begin the &s;ub|ject, I never will pre&s;ume to mention it again."</P>
<P>"I take you at your word,"&mdash;returned his lord|&s;hip, "and in con&s;equence of that, and that alone, we are friends.&mdash;Good night, Sir."</P>
<P>Sandford bowed with all humility, and they went to their &s;eparate bed-chambers.</P>

<P>AFTER Lord Elmwood had retired into his chamber, it was &s;ome time before he read the letter Sandford had given him. He fir&s;t walked backwards and forwards in the room&mdash;he then be|gan to take off &s;ome part of his dre&s;s, but did it &s;lowly. At length he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his valet, and &s;itting down, took the letter from his pocket.&mdash;He looked at the &s;eal, but not at the direction; for he &s;eemed to dread to &s;ee Lady Elmwood's hand-writing.&mdash;He then laid it on the table, and began again to un|dre&s;s. He did not proceed, but taking up the letter quickly, (with a kind of effort in making the re&s;o|lution) broke it open. The&s;e were its contents:</P>
<Q><P>My Lord, Who writes this letter, I well know&mdash;I well know al&s;o to whom it is addre&s;&s;ed.&mdash;I feel with the mo&s;t powerful force both our &s;ituations.&mdash;nor &s;hould I dare to offer you even this humble petition, but that at the time you receive it, there will be no &s;uch per&s;on as I am in exi&s;t|ance.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="025650_0227_0FCEB293D523E168">
For my&s;elf, then, all concern will be over&mdash;but there is a care that pur&s;ues me to the grave, and threatens my want of repo&s;e even there.</P>
<P>I leave a child&mdash;I will not call her mine, that has undone her&mdash;I will not call her yours, that will be of no avail.&mdash;I pre&s;ent her before you as the grand-daughter of Mr. Milner.&mdash;Oh! do not refu&s;e an a&s;&s;ylum even in your own hou&s;e, to the de&s;titute offspring of your friend; the la&s;t, and only remaining branch of his family.</P>
<P>Receive her into your hou&s;hold, be her condi|tion there ever &s;o abject.&mdash;I cannot write di&s;tinct|ly what I would&mdash;my &s;en&s;es are not impaired, but the powers of expre&s;&s;ion are.&mdash;The unfortu|nate child in the &s;cripture (a le&s;&s;on I have &s;tu|died) his complaint, has made this wi&s;h cling &s;o fa&s;t to my heart, that without the di&s;tant hope of its being fulfilled, death would have more terrors than my weak mind could &s;upport.</P>
<P><HI>I will go to my father; how many &s;ervants live in my father's hou&s;e, and are fed with plenty, while I &s;tarve in a foreign land?</HI></P>
<P>I do not a&s;k a parent's fe&s;tive rejoicing at her approach&mdash;I do not even a&s;k her father to be|hold her;&mdash;but let her live under his protection.&mdash;For her grandfather's &s;ake do not refu&s;e this&mdash;to the child of his child whom he tru&s;ted to your care, do not refu&s;e it.</P>
<P>Be her ho&s;t; I remit the tie of being her pa|rent.&mdash;Never &s;ee her&mdash;but let her &s;ometimes live under the &s;ame roof with you.</P>
<P>It is Mi&s;s Milner your ward, to whom you ne|ver refu&s;ed a reque&s;t, &s;upplicates you&mdash;not now for your nephew Ru&s;hbrook, but for one &s;o much more dear, that a denial&mdash;&s;he dares not &s;uffer her thoughts to glance that way&mdash;She will hope&mdash;and in that hope, bids you farewell, with all the love &s;he ever bore you.</P>

Farewell Lord Elmwood&mdash;and before you throw this letter from you with contempt or anger, ca&s;t your imagination into the grave where I am lying.&mdash;Reflect upon all the days of my pa&s;t life&mdash;the the anxious moments I have known, and what has been their end.&mdash;Behold <HI>me,</HI> al&s;o in my al|tered face there is no anxiety&mdash;no joy or &s;orrow&mdash;all is over.&mdash;My whole frame is motionle&s;s&mdash;my heart beats no more.&mdash;Look at my horrid habitation, too,&mdash;and a&s;k your&s;elf&mdash;whether I am an object of re&s;entment?</P></Q>
<P>While Lord Elmwood read this letter, it trembled in his hand: he once or twice wiped the tears from his eyes as he read, and once laid the letter down for a few minutes. At its conclu&s;ion the tears flowed fa&s;t down his face; but he &s;eemed both a&s;hamed and angry they did, and was going to throw the paper upon the fire; he however &s;ud|denly checked his hand, and putting it ha&s;tily into his pocket, went to bed.</P>

<P>THE next morning, when Lord Elmwood and Sandford met at breakfa&s;t, Sandford was pale with fear for the &s;ucce&s;s of Lady Elmwood's letter&mdash;his lord&s;hip was pale too, but there was be&s;ide upon his face &s;omething which evidently marked he was di&s;plea&s;ed&mdash;Sandford ob&s;erved it, and was all humblene&s;s, both in his words and looks, in order to &s;often him.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the breakfa&s;t was removed, his lord|&s;hip drew Lady Elmwood's letter from his pocket, and holding it towards Sandford, &s;aid,</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="025650_0229_0FCEB294B63B6470">
"That may be of more value to you, than it is to me, therefore I give it you."</P>
<P>Sandford called up a look of &s;urpri&s;e, as if he did not know the letter again.</P>
<P>"'Tis Lady Elmwood's letter," &s;aid his lord&s;hip, "and I give it to you for two rea&s;ons."</P>
<P>Sandford took it, and putting it up, a&s;ked fear|fully, "What tho&s;e two rea&s;ons were?"</P>
<P>"Fir&s;t," &s;aid Lord Elmwood, "becau&s;e I think it is a rolick you may like to pre&s;erve&mdash;my &s;econd rea&s;on is, that you may &s;how it to her daughter, and let her know why, and on what conditions I grant her mother's reque&s;t."</P>
<P>"You do then grant it?" cried Sandford joy|fully; "I thank you&mdash;you are kind&mdash;you are con|&s;iderate."</P>
<P>"Be not too ha&s;ty in your gratitude," returned his lord&s;hip, "you may have cau&s;e to recall it."</P>
<P>"I know what you have &s;aid," replied Sandford, "You have &s;aid you grant Lady Elmwood's re|que&s;t&mdash;you cannot recall the&s;e words, nor I my gra|titude."</P>
<P>"Do you know what her reque&s;t is?" &s;aid Lord Elmwood.</P>
<P>"Not exactly, my lord&mdash;I told you before, I did not; but it is, no doubt, &s;omething in favour of her child."</P>
<P>"I think not," replied his lord&s;hip. "Such as it is, however, I grant it.&mdash;But in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e of the word&mdash;no farther; and one neglect of my commands, relea&s;es my promi&s;e totally."</P>
<P>"We will take care, Sir, not to di&s;obey them."</P>
<P>"Then li&s;ten to what they are&mdash;and to you I give the charge of delivering them again.&mdash;Lady Elmwood has petitioned me in the name of her fa|ther, (a name I reverence) to give his grand-child the &s;anction of my protection.&mdash;In the literal &s;en&s;e, to &s;uffer her to re&s;ide occa&s;ionally at one of my

<P>"Nor can it be a hard&s;hip to obey this command&mdash;&s;he cannot lament the &s;eparation from a parent whom &s;he never knew"&mdash;Sandford was going ea|gerly to prove the error of that a&s;&s;ertion, but his lord&s;hip prevented him, &s;aying, "In a word&mdash;without farther argument&mdash;if &s;he obeys me in this, I will certainly provide for her as my daughter dur|ing my life, and leave her a fortune at my death&mdash;but if &s;he dares&mdash;"</P>

<P>"Have you not heard me &s;ay &s;o? And do you imagine I have changed my determination? I am not given to alter my re&s;olutions, Mr. Sandford; and I thought you knew I was not;&mdash;be&s;ides will not my title be extinct, whoever I make my heir?
<PB N="229" REF="025650_0231_0FCEB2969D02D970">
&mdash;Could any thing but a &s;on have pre&s;erved my title?"</P>
<P>"Then it is yet po&s;&s;ible&mdash;"</P>
<P>"By marrying again, you mean?&mdash;No&mdash;no&mdash;I have had enough of marriage&mdash;and Henry Ru&s;h|brook I leave my heir. Therefore, Sir&mdash;"</P>
<P>"My lord, I do not pre&s;ume&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Do not, Sandford, and we may &s;till be friends.&mdash;But I am not to be controlled as formerly; my temper is changed of late; changed to what it was originally; till your &s;chola&s;tic and religious rules reformed it. You may remember, how trouble|&s;ome it was to conquer my &s;tubborn di&s;po&s;ition in my youth; then, indeed, you did; but in my man|hood you will find the ta&s;k more difficult."</P>
<P>Sandford again repeated, "He &s;hould not pre|&s;ume&mdash;"</P>
<P>To which his lord&s;hip again made an an&s;wer, "Do not, Sandford; and added, "for I have a &s;incere regard for you, and &s;hould be loth at the&s;e years to quarrel with you &s;eriou&s;ly."</P>
<P>Sandford turned away his head to hide his tears.</P>
<P>"Nay, if we do quarrel," re&s;umed his lord&s;hip, "you know it mu&s;t be your own fault;&mdash;and as this is a theme the mo&s;t likely of any (indeed the only one on which we can have a difference &s;uch as we cannot forgive) take care never from this day to re&s;ume it;&mdash;indeed that of it&s;elf, is an offence I will not pardon.&mdash;I have been clear and explicit in all I have &s;aid; there can be no fear of mi&s;taking my meaning, therefore all future explanation is unnece&s;&s;ary&mdash;nor will I permit a word, or a hint on the &s;ubject from any one, without &s;howing my re&s;entment to the hour of my death." He was going out of the room.</P>
<P>"But before we bid adieu to the &s;ubject for ever, my lord&mdash;there was another per&s;on whom I named to you&mdash;"</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="025650_0232_0FCEB266496CC3F8">
"Do you mean Mi&s;s Woodley?&mdash;Oh, by all means let her live at Elmwood Hou&s;e too.&mdash;On con|&s;ideration, I have no objection to &s;ee Mi&s;s Woodley at any time&mdash;I &s;hall be glad to &s;ee her.&mdash;Do not let <HI>her</HI> be frightened at me&mdash;to her I &s;hall be the &s;ame I have always been."</P>
<P>"She is a good woman, my lord," cried Sandford, plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>"You need not tell me that, Mr. Sandford; I know her worth."&mdash;And his lord&s;hip left the room.</P>
<P>Sandford, to relieve Mi&s;s Woodley and her lovely charge from the &s;u&s;pen&s;e in which he had left them, &s;et off for their habitation the next day; in order him&s;elf to conduct them from thence to Elmwood Hou&s;e, and appoint &s;ome retired part of it for Lady Matilda, again&s;t the annual vi&s;it her father paid there. But before he left London, Giffard, the &s;teward, took an opportunity to wait upon him, and let him know, that his lord had acquainted him, with the con&s;ent he had given for his daughter to be admitted at Elmwood Ca&s;tle; and upon what re&s;trictions; likewi&s;e that he had denounced the mo&s;t &s;evere threats, &s;hould the&s;e re&s;trictions be broken. Sandford thanked Giffard for his friendly information, which &s;erved him as a &s;econd warning of the circum&s;pection that was nece&s;&s;ary; and having taken leave of his lord&s;hip under the pre|tence "he could not live in the &s;moke of London," he &s;et out for the north.</P>
<P>It is unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay with what delight Sand|ford was received by Mi&s;s Woodley, and the haple&s;s daughter of Lady Elmwood, even before he told his errand. They both loved him &s;incerely; more e&s;pecially Lady Matilda; who&s;e forlorn &s;tate, and innocent &s;ufferings, had ever excited his compa&s;&s;ion in the extreme&s;t degree, and had cau&s;ed him ever to treat her with the utmo&s;t affection, tenderne&s;s,
<PB N="231" REF="025650_0233_0FCEB29958AE1D80">
and re&s;pect. She knew too, how much he had been her mother's friend; for that &s;he al&s;o loved him; and being honoured with the friend&s;hip of her father, &s;he looked up to him with reverence and awe. For Matilda (with an excellent under|&s;tanding, a &s;edatene&s;s above her years, and early accu&s;tomed to the mo&s;t private conver&s;e between Lady Elmwood and Mi&s;s Woodley) was perfectly acquainted with the whole private hi&s;tory of her mother; and was by her taught, that re&s;pect and admiration of her father's virtues which they ju&s;tly merited."</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the joy of beholding Mr. Sand|ford, once more to cheer by his pre&s;ence their &s;o|litary dwelling; no &s;ooner were the fir&s;t kind greetings over, than the dread of what he might have to inform them, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed both poor Matilda and Mi&s;s Woodley &s;o powerfully, their gladne&s;s was changed into affright. Their apprehen&s;ions were far more forcible than their curio&s;ity;&mdash;they dur&s;t not a&s;k a que&s;tion, and even began to wi&s;h he would continue &s;ilent upon the &s;ubject, on which they feared to li&s;ten. For near two hours he was &s;o.&mdash;At length, after a &s;hort interval from &s;peak|ing, (during which they waited with anxiety for what he might next &s;ay) he turned to Lady Matilda, and &s;aid,</P>
<P>"You don't a&s;k for your father, my dear?"</P>
<P>"I did not know it was proper," &s;he replied, timidly.</P>
<P>"It is always proper," an&s;wered Sandford, "for <HI>you</HI> to think of him, though he &s;hould never think on you."</P>
<P>She bur&s;t into tears, &s;aying, &s;he "<HI>did</HI> think of him, but &s;he felt an apprehen&s;ion at mention|ing his name,&mdash;and &s;he wept bitterly while &s;he &s;poke.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="025650_0234_0FCEB267C0A35C50">
"Nay, do not think I reproved you," &s;aid Sand|ford; "I but told you what was right."</P>
<P>"Nay," &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley, "it is not for that &s;he cries thus; &s;he fears her father has not com|plied with her mother's reque&s;t. Perhaps not even her letter?"</P>
<P>"Yes, he has read it," returned Sandford.</P>
<P>"Oh heavens!" exclaimed Matilda, cla&s;ping her hands together, and the tears falling fa&s;ter &s;till.</P>
<P>"Do not be &s;o much alarmed, my dear," &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley; "you know we are prepared for the wor&s;t; and you know you promi&s;ed your mother, whatever your fate was, to &s;ubmit with patience."</P>
<P>"Yes," replied Matilda, "and I am prepared for every thing, but my father's refu&s;al to my dear mother."</P>
<P>"Your father has not refu&s;ed your mother's re|que&s;t," replied Sandford.</P>
<P>She was leaping from her &s;eat with ec&s;ta&s;y.</P>
<P>"But," continued he, "do you know what her reque&s;t was?"</P>
<P>"Not entirely," replied Matilda, "and &s;ince it is granted, I am carele&s;s.&mdash;But &s;he told me her let|ter concerned none but me."</P>
<P>To explain perfectly to Matilda, Lady Elmwood's letter, and that &s;he might perfectly under&s;tand upon what terms &s;he was admitted into Elmwood Hou&s;e, Sandford now read the letter to her; and repeated, as nearly as he could remember, the whole of the conver&s;ation that pa&s;&s;ed between Lord Elm|wood and him&s;elf; not even &s;paring, with an errone|ous delicacy, any of tho&s;e threats her father had de|nounced, &s;hould &s;he dare to break through the li|mits he pre&s;cribed&mdash;nor did he try to &s;often, in one in&s;tance, a word his lord&s;hip uttered. She li&s;tened &s;ometimes with tears, &s;ometimes with hope, but always with awe and terror, to every &s;entence wherein her father was concerned.&mdash;Once &s;he called him cruel&mdash;then exclaimed "he
<PB N="233" REF="025650_0235_0FCEB29AC05D6628">
was kind;" but at the end of Sandford's intelli|gence, concluded &s;he was happy and grateful for the boon be&s;towed.&mdash;Even her mother had not a more exalted and tran&s;cendant idea of Lord Elmwood's worth, than his daughter had formed; and this little bounty ju&s;t obtained, had not been greater in her mother's e&s;timation, than it was now in her's.&mdash;Mi&s;s Woodley, too, &s;miled at the pro&s;pect be|fore her&mdash;&s;he e&s;teemed Lord Elmwood beyond any mortal living&mdash;&s;he was proud to hear what he had &s;aid in her prai&s;e, and overjoyed at the pro&s;pect &s;he &s;hould be once again in his company; picturing, at the &s;ame time, a thou&s;and of the brighte&s;t hopes, from watching every emotion of his &s;oul, and catching every proper occa&s;ion to excite, or increa&s;e his paternal &s;entiments.&mdash;Yet &s;he had the prudence to conceal tho&s;e vague hopes from his child, le&s;t a di&s;appointment might prove fatal; and a&s;&s;uming a behaviour not too much elated or depre&s;&s;ed, &s;he advi&s;ed they &s;hould hope for the be&s;t, but yet, as u&s;ual, expect and prepare for the wor&s;t.&mdash;After taking mea&s;ures for quitting their melancholy abode; within the fortnight they all departed for Elmwood Ca&s;tle.&mdash;Matilda, Mi&s;s Woodley, and even Sandford, fir&s;t vi&s;iting Lady Elmwood's grave, and bedewed it with their tears.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VI.</HEAD>
<P>IT was on a dark evening in the month of March, that Lady Matilda, accompanied by Sandford and Mi&s;s Woodley, arrived at Elmwood Ca&s;tle, the mag|nificent &s;eat of her father.&mdash;Sandford cho&s;e the
<PB N="234" REF="025650_0236_0FCEB26AC529D6A0">
evening; rather to &s;teal into the hou&s;e privately, than by any appearance of parade, &s;uffer Lord Elm|wood to be reminded of it by the public prints, or by any other accident.&mdash;Nor would he give the neighbours or &s;ervants the &s;lighte&s;t rea&s;on to &s;up|po&s;e, the daughter of their lord was admitted into his hou&s;e in any other &s;ituation than, that, which &s;he really was.</P>
<P>As the porter opened the gates of the avenue to the carriage that brought them, Matilda felt an awful, and yet a gladful &s;en&s;ation no terms can de|&s;cribe.&mdash;As &s;he entered the door of the hou&s;e, this &s;en&s;ation increa&s;ed&mdash;and as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed along the &s;pacious hall, the &s;plendid &s;tairca&s;e, and many &s;tately apartments, wonder! with a crowd of the tendere&s;t, yet mo&s;t afflicting, &s;entiments ru&s;hed to her heart.&mdash;She gazed with a&s;toni&s;hment!&mdash;&s;he reflected with more.</P>
<P>"And is <HI>my father</HI> the ma&s;ter of this hou&s;e?" &s;he cried&mdash;"And was my mother once the mi&s;tre&s;s of this hou&s;e?"&mdash;Here a flood of tears relieved her from a part of that burthen, which was before in|&s;upportable.</P>
<P>"Yes," replied Sandford, "and you are the mi&s;tre&s;s of it now, till your father arrives."</P>
<P>"Good God!" exclaimed &s;he, "and will he ever arrive? and &s;hall I live to &s;leep under the &s;ame roof with my father?"</P>
<P>"My dear," replied Mi&s;s Woodley, "have not you been told &s;o?"</P>
<P>"Yes," &s;aid &s;he, "but though I heard it with extreme plea&s;ure, yet the idea never &s;o forcibly af|fected me as at this moment.&mdash;I now feel, as the reality approaches, this has been kindne&s;s &s;ufficient&mdash;I do not a&s;k for more&mdash;I am now convinced, from what this trial makes me feel, that to &s;ee my father, would cau&s;e a &s;en&s;ation, a feeling, I could not &s;urvive."</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="025650_0237_0FCEB29E420D0A28">
The next morning gave to Matilda more objects &s;till of admiration and wonder, as &s;he walked over the exten&s;ive gardens, groves, and other plea&s;ure-grounds belonging to the hou&s;e. She who had never been beyond the dreary, ruinate place where her decea&s;ed mother had cho&s;en her re&s;idence, was naturally &s;truck with amazement and delight at the grandeur of a &s;eat, which travellers had come for miles to &s;ee, and not thought their time mi&s;|pent.</P>
<P>There was one object, however, among all &s;he &s;aw, which attracted her attention above the re&s;t, and &s;he would &s;tand for hours to look at it&mdash;This was a full length portrait of Lord Elmwood, e&s;teemed a very capital picture, and a great likene&s;s&mdash;to this picture &s;he would &s;igh and weep; though when it was fir&s;t pointed out to her, &s;he &s;hrunk back with fear, and it was &s;ome time before &s;he dared venture to ca&s;t her eyes completely upon it. In the features of her father &s;he was proud to di&s;|cern the exact moulds in which her own appeared to have been modelled; yet Matilda's per&s;on, &s;hape, and complexion were &s;o extremely like what her mother's once were, that at the fir&s;t glance &s;he ap|peared to have a &s;till greater re&s;emblance of her, than of her father&mdash;but her mind and manners were all Lord Elmwood's; &s;oftened by the delicacy of her &s;ex, the extreme tenderne&s;s of her heart, and the melancholy of her &s;ituation.</P>
<P>She was now in her &s;eventeenth year&mdash;of the &s;ame age, within a year and a few months, of her mother, when &s;he became the ward of Dorriforth.&mdash;She was ju&s;t three years old when her father went abroad, and remembered &s;omething of bid|ding him farewell; but more of taking cherries from his hand as he pulled them from the tree to give her.</P>
<P>Educated in the &s;chool of adver&s;ity, and inured
<PB N="236" REF="025650_0238_0FCEB26C391F90D0">
to retirement from her infancy, &s;he had acquired a ta&s;te for all tho&s;e amu&s;ements which a reclu&s;e life affords&mdash;She was fond of walking and riding&mdash;was accompli&s;hed in the arts of mu&s;ic and drawing, by the mo&s;t careful in&s;tructions of her mother&mdash;and as a &s;cholar &s;he excelled mo&s;t of her &s;ex, from the great pains Sandford had taken with that part of her e|ducation, and the great abilities he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed for the ta&s;k.</P>
<P>In devoting certain hours of the day to &s;tudy with him, others to mu&s;ic, riding, and &s;uch recre|ations, Matilda's time never appeared tedious at Elmwood Hou&s;e, although &s;he neither received nor paid one vi&s;it&mdash;for it was &s;oon divulged in the neigh|bourhood upon what &s;tipulation &s;he re&s;ided at her father's, and intimated, that the mo&s;t prudent and friendly behaviour of the friends both of her fa|ther and of her&s;elf, would be, to take no notice whatever that &s;he lived among them: and as Lord Elmwood's will was a law all around, &s;uch was the con&s;equence, of his will being known or &s;uppo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Neither did Mi&s;s Woodley regret the want of vi&s;iters, but found her&s;elf far more &s;atisfied in her pre&s;ent &s;ituation, than her mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes could have formed&mdash;&s;he had a companion whom &s;he loved with an equal fondne&s;s, with which &s;he had loved her decea&s;ed mother; and frequently in this charming man&s;ion, where &s;he had &s;o often be|held Lady Elmwood, her imagination pictured Ma|tilda as her, ri&s;en from the grave in her former youth, health, and exqui&s;ite beauty.</P>
<P>In peace, in content, though far from happine&s;s, the days and weeks pa&s;&s;ed away till about the middle of Augu&s;t, when preparations began to be made for the arrival of Lord Elmwood.&mdash;The week in which he was to come was at length fixed, and &s;ome part of his retinue was arrived before him.&mdash;When this was told to Matilda, &s;he &s;tarted, and
<PB N="237" REF="025650_0239_0FCEB29F85858748">
looked ju&s;t as her mother at her age oftentimes had done, when, in &s;pite of her love, &s;he was con&s;ci|ous &s;he had offended him, and was terrified at his approach. Sandford ob&s;erving this, put out his hand, and taking her's, &s;hook it kindly; and bade her (but it was not in a cheerful tone) "not be afraid." This gave her no confidence; and &s;he began, before his lord&s;hip's arrival, to &s;eclude her|&s;elf in tho&s;e apartments which were allotted for her during the time of his &s;tay; and in the timorous expectation of his coming, her appetite declined, and &s;he lo&s;t all her colour.&mdash;Even Mi&s;s Woodley, who&s;e &s;pirits had been for &s;ome time elated with the hopes &s;he had formed; on drawing near to the te&s;t, found tho&s;e hopes vani&s;hed; and though &s;he endeavoured to conceal it, &s;he was replete with ap|prehen&s;ions.&mdash;Sandford had certainly fewer fears than either; yet upon the eve of the day on which his patron was to arrive, he was evidently ca&s;t down.</P>
<P>Lady Matilda once a&s;ked him&mdash;"Are you certain, Mr. Sandford, you made no mi&s;take in re&s;pect to what Lord Elmwood &s;aid, when he granted my mother's reque&s;t? Are you &s;ure he <HI>did</HI> grant it?&mdash;Was there nothing equivocal on which he may ground his di&s;plea&s;ure, &s;hould he hear I am here? Oh! do not let me hazard the being once again turned out of his hou&s;e!&mdash;Oh! &s;ave me from pro|voking him perhaps to cur&s;e me."&mdash;And here &s;he cla&s;ped her hands together with the mo&s;t fervent petition in the dread of what might happen.</P>
<P>"If you doubt my word or my &s;en&s;es," &s;aid Sandford, "call Giffard, and let him inform you;&mdash;my lord repeated the &s;ame words to him he did to me."</P>
<P>Though from her rea&s;on Matilda could not doubt of any mi&s;take from Mr. Sandford, yet her fears &s;ugge&s;ted a thou&s;and &s;cruples; and this reference
<PB N="238" REF="025650_0240_0FCEB26DB2DD2DE0">
to the &s;teward, &s;he received with the utmo&s;t &s;atis|faction, (though &s;he did not think it nece&s;&s;ary to apply to him,) as it perfectly convinced her of the folly of tho&s;e &s;u&s;picions &s;he had entertained.</P>
<P>"And yet, Mr. Sandford," &s;aid &s;he, "if it is &s;o, why are you le&s;s cheerful than you were? I cannot help thinking but it mu&s;t be the expectation of Lord Elmwood, which has cau&s;ed in you this change."</P>
<P>"I don't know;" replied Sandford, carele&s;sly, "but I believe I am grown afraid of your father.&mdash;His temper is a great deal altered from what it once was&mdash;he exalts his voice, and u&s;es har&s;h ex|pre&s;&s;ions upon the lea&s;t provocation&mdash;his eyes fla&s;h lightning, and his face is di&s;torted with anger on the &s;lighte&s;t motives&mdash;he turns away his old &s;ervants at a moment's warning, and no conce&s;&s;ion can make their peace.&mdash;In a word, I am more at my ca&s;e when I am away from him&mdash;and I really believe," added he with a &s;mile, but with a tear at the &s;ame time, "I really believe I am more afraid of him in my age, than he was of me when he was a boy."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley was pre&s;ent; &s;he and Matilda looked at one another; and each &s;aw the other turn pale, at this de&s;cription.</P>
<P>The day at length came on which Lord Elmwood was expected to dinner.&mdash;It had been a high gra|tification to his daughter to have gone to the top|mo&s;t window of the hou&s;e, to have only beheld his chariot enter the avenue; but it was a gratification which her fears, her tremour, her extreme &s;en&s;ibi|lity would not permit her to enjoy.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley and &s;he &s;at down that day to din|ner in their retired apartments; which were de|tached from the other part of the hou&s;e by a gal|lery; and of the door leading to the gallery, they had a key to impede any one from pa&s;&s;ing that way, without fir&s;t ringing a bell; to an&s;wer which, was
<PB N="239" REF="025650_0241_0FCEB2A0C0EA2D38">
the &s;ole employment of a &s;ervant who was placed there during his lord&s;hip's re&s;idence, le&s;t by any ac|cident he might chance to come near that unfre|quented part of the hou&s;e; on which occa&s;ion the man was to give immediate notice to his lady.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley and &s;he &s;at down to dinner, but did not dine&mdash;Sandford ate, as u&s;ual, with Lord Elmwood.&mdash;When the &s;ervant brought up tea, Mi&s;s Woodley a&s;ked him if he had &s;een his lord&mdash;The man an&s;wered, "Yes, Madam; and he looks va&s;tly well."&mdash;Matilda wept with joy to hear it.</P>
<P>About nine in the evening Sandford rung at the bell, and was admitted&mdash;and never was he &s;o wel|come&mdash;Matilda hung upon him, as if his recent &s;ociety with her father had endeared her to him more than ever; and &s;taring anxiou&s;ly in his face, &s;eemed to a&s;k him to tell her &s;omething of Lord Elmwood, and &s;omething that &s;hould not alarm her.</P>
<P>"Well&mdash;how do you find your&s;elf?" &s;aid he to her.</P>
<P>"How are you, Mr. Sandford?" &s;he returned, with a &s;igh.</P>
<P>"Oh! very well," replied he.</P>
<P>"Is my lord in a good temper?" a&s;ked Mi&s;s Woodley.</P>
<P>"Yes; very well," replied Sandford, with in|difference.</P>
<P>"Did he &s;eem glad to &s;ee you?" a&s;ked Matilda.</P>
<P>"He &s;hook me by the hand," replied Sandford.</P>
<P>"That was a &s;ign he was glad to &s;ee you, was it not?" &s;aid Matilda.</P>
<P>"Yes; but he could not do le&s;s."</P>
<P>"Nor more," replied &s;he.</P>
<P>"He looks very well, our &s;ervant tells us," &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley.</P>
<P>"Extremely well indeed," an&s;wered Sandford: "and, to tell the truth, I never &s;aw him in better &s;pirits."</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="025650_0242_0FCEB2700BAFAB30">
"That is well:" &s;aid Matilda, and &s;ighed a weight of fears from her heart.</P>
<P>"Where is he now, Mr. Sandford?"</P>
<P>"Gone to take a walk about his grounds, and &s;o I &s;tole here the time."</P>
<P>"What was your conver&s;ation during dinner?"</P>
<P>"Hor&s;es, hay, farming, and politics."</P>
<P>"Won't you &s;up with him?"</P>
<P>"I &s;hall &s;ee him again before I go to bed."</P>
<P>"And again to-morrow!"&mdash;cried Matilda, "what happine&s;s!"</P>
<P>"He has vi&s;iters to-morrow," &s;aid Sandford, "coming for a week or two."</P>
<P>"Thank heaven!" &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley, "he will then be diverted from thinking on us."</P>
<P>"Do you know," returned Sandford, "it is my firm opinion, that his thinking of ye at pre&s;ent, is the cau&s;e of his good &s;pirits."</P>
<P>"Oh, heavens!" cried Matilda, lifting up her hands with rapture.</P>
<P>"Nay, do not mi&s;take me;" &s;aid Sandford; "I would not have you build a foundation for joy upon this; for if he is in &s;pirits that you are in this hou&s;e&mdash;&s;o near him&mdash;po&s;itively under his protection&mdash;yet he will not allow him&s;elf to think, that is the cau&s;e of his content&mdash;and the &s;entiments he has adopted, are now become natural to him, will re|main the &s;ame as ever; nay, perhaps with greater force, while he &s;u&s;pects his weakne&s;s (as he calls it) acting in oppo&s;ition."</P>
<P>"If he does but think of me with tenderne&s;s," cried Matilda, "I am recompen&s;ed."</P>
<P>"And what recompen&s;e would his kind thoughts be to you," &s;aid Sandford, "were he to turn you out to beggary?"</P>
<P>"A great deal&mdash;a great deal," &s;he replied.</P>
<P>"But how are you to know how he has the&s;e
<PB N="241" REF="025650_0243_0FCEB2A247A8B950">
kind thoughts, while he gives you no proof of them?"</P>
<P>"No, Mr. Sandford; but <HI>&s;uppo&s;ing</HI> we could know them without the proof?"</P>
<P>"But as that is impo&s;&s;ible," an&s;wered he, "I &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e, till the proof appears, I am mi&s;|taken."</P>
<P>Matilda looked deeply concerned that the argu|ment &s;hould conclude in her di&s;appointment, for to have believed her&s;elf thought of with tenderne&s;s by her father, would have alone con&s;tituted her happine&s;s.</P>
<P>When the &s;ervant came up with &s;omething by way of &s;upper, he told Mr. Sandford his lord&s;hip was returned from his walk and had inquired for him; Sandford immediately bade his companions good night, and left them.</P>
<P>"How &s;trange is this!" cried Matilda, when Mi&s;s Woodley and &s;he were alone, "My father within a few rooms of me, and yet I am debarred from &s;eeing him!&mdash;Only by walking a few paces I might be at his feet, and perhaps receive his ble&s;|&s;ing."</P>
<P>"You make me &s;hudder," &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley; "but &s;ome &s;pirits le&s;s fearful than mine, might per|haps advi&s;e you to try the experiment."</P>
<P>"Not for worlds," returned Matilda; "no coun&s;el could tempt me to &s;uch temerity; and yet to entertain the thought, that it is po&s;&s;ible I could do this, is a &s;ource of great comfort."</P>
<P>This conver&s;ation la&s;ted till bed-time, and later; for they &s;at up beyond their u&s;ual hour to indulge it.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley &s;lept little, but Matilda le&s;s&mdash;&s;he awaked repeatedly during the night, and every time &s;ighed to her&s;elf, "I &s;leep in the &s;ame hou&s;e with my father! Ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirit of my mother, look down and rejoice."</P>

<P>THE next day the whole ca&s;tle appeared to Lady Matilda (though &s;he was in &s;ome degree re|tired from it) all tumult and bu&s;tle; as was u&s;ually the ca&s;e while his lord&s;hip was there. She &s;aw from her windows &s;ervants running acro&s;s the yards and park, hor&s;es and carriages driving with fury, all the &s;uite of a nobleman; and it &s;eemed &s;ome|times to elate, at other times to depre&s;s her.</P>
<P>The&s;e impre&s;&s;ions however, and others of fear and anxiety, which her father's fir&s;t arrival had excited, by degrees wore away; and after &s;ome &s;hort time, &s;he was in the &s;ame tranquil &s;tate &s;he enjoyed before he came.</P>
<P>He had vi&s;iters, to &s;tay a week or two; he paid &s;ome vi&s;its him&s;elf for &s;everal days; and thus the time pa&s;&s;ed, till it was about four weeks &s;ince he arrived; during which, Sandford, with all his pe|netration, could never clearly di&s;cover whether he had once called to mind his daughter was living in the &s;ame hou&s;e. He had not named her (that was not extraordinary) con&s;equently no one dur&s;t name her to him; but he had not even mentioned Mi&s;s Woodley, of whom he had &s;o lately &s;poken in the kinde&s;t terms, and &s;aid, "He &s;hould take plea&s;ure in &s;eeing her again." From the&s;e contradictions in Lord Elmwood's behaviour in re&s;pect to her, it was Mi&s;s Woodley's plan neither to throw her&s;elf in his way, or avoid him. She therefore frequently walked about the hou&s;e while he was in it, not in|deed wholly without re&s;traint, but at lea&s;t with the &s;how of liberty. This freedom, indulged for &s;ome time without peril, became at la&s;t le&s;s cautious;
<PB N="243" REF="025650_0245_0FCEB2A6B95E62D8">
and no ill con&s;equences ari&s;ing from its practice, her &s;cruples gradually cea&s;ed.</P>
<P>One morning, however, as &s;he was cro&s;&s;ing the large hall, thoughtle&s;s of danger, a foot&s;tep at a di&s;tance alarmed her almo&s;t without knowing why&mdash;&s;he &s;topped for a moment, thinking to return; the &s;teps approached quicker, and before &s;he could retreat, &s;he beheld Lord Elmwood at the other end of the hall, and perceived that he &s;aw her.&mdash;It was now too late to he&s;itate what was to be done; &s;he could not go back, and had not courage to go on; &s;he therefore &s;tood &s;till.&mdash;Di&s;concerted, and much affected at his &s;ight, (their former intimacy coming to her mind, together with the many years, and many &s;ad occurrences pa&s;&s;ed, &s;ince &s;he la&s;t &s;aw him) all her intentions, all her meditated plans how to conduct her&s;elf on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, gave way to a &s;udden &s;hock&mdash;and to make the meeting yet more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, her very fright &s;he knew mu&s;t &s;erve to recall more powerfully to his mind, the &s;ubject &s;he mo&s;t wi&s;hed him to forget. The &s;teward was with his lord&s;hip, and as they came up clo&s;e by her &s;ide, Giffard ob&s;erving him look at her earne&s;tly, &s;aid &s;oftly, but &s;o as &s;he heard him, "My lord, it is Mi&s;s Woodley." Lord Elmwood's hat was off im|mediately, and coming to her with alacrity, he took her by the hand and &s;aid, "Indeed, Mi&s;s Wood|ley, I did not know you&mdash;I am very glad to &s;ee you;" and while he &s;poke, &s;hook her hand with a cordiality her tender heart could not bear&mdash;and never did &s;he feel &s;o hard a &s;truggle as to re&s;train her tears. But the thought of Matilda's fate&mdash;the idea of awaking in his mind a &s;entiment that might irritate him again&s;t his child, wrought more forci|bly than every other effort; and though &s;he could not reply di&s;tinctly, &s;he replied without weeping.&mdash;Whether he &s;aw her embarra&s;&s;ment, and wi&s;hed
<PB N="244" REF="025650_0246_0FCEB272F4C6FC80">
to relea&s;e her from it, or was in ha&s;te to conceal his own; he left her almo&s;t in&s;tantly; but not till he had intreated &s;he would dine that very day with him and Mr. Sandford, who were to dine without other company. She curt&s;ied a&s;&s;ent, and flew to tell Matilda what had occurred. After li&s;tening with anxiety and joy to all &s;he told, Matilda laid hold of that hand &s;he &s;aid Lord Elmwood had held, and pre&s;&s;ed it to her lips with love and re|verence.</P>
<P>When Mi&s;s Woodley made her appearance at dinner, Sandford, (who had not &s;een her &s;ince the invitation, and did not know of it) looked amazed!&mdash;on which his lord&s;hip &s;aid, "Do you know, Sandford, I met Mi&s;s Woodley this morning, and had it not been for Giffard I &s;hould have pa&s;&s;ed her without knowing her&mdash;out Mi&s;s Woodley, if I am not &s;o much altered but that you knew me, I take it unkind you did not &s;peak fir&s;t."&mdash;She was un|able to &s;peak even now&mdash;he &s;aw it, and changed the conver&s;ation; which Sandford was happy to join, for in the pre&s;ent di&s;cour&s;e he did not feel him&s;elf very comfortable.</P>
<P>As they advanced in their dinner, Mi&s;s Woodley's and Sandford's embarra&s;&s;ment dimini&s;hed; while Lord Elmwood in his turn became, not embarra&s;&s;ed, but ab&s;ent and melancholy.&mdash;He now and then &s;ighed heavily&mdash;and called for wine much oftener than he was accu&s;tomed.</P>
<P>When Mi&s;s Woodley took her leave, his lord&s;hip invited her to dine with him and Sandford whenever it was convenient to her;&mdash;he &s;aid many things, too, of the &s;ame kind, and all with the utmo&s;t ci|vility, yet not with that warmth with which he had &s;poken in the morning&mdash;into that he had been &s;ur|pri&s;ed, while this coolne&s;s was the effect of re|flection.</P>
<P>When &s;he came to Lady Matilda, and Sandford
<PB N="245" REF="025650_0247_0FCEB2A846D7F018">
had joined them, they talked and deliberated on what had pa&s;&s;ed.&mdash;</P>
<P>"You acknowledge, Mr. Sandford," &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley, "that you think my pre&s;ence affected Lord Elmwood &s;o as to make him much more thoughtful than u&s;ual; if you imagine the&s;e thoughts were upon Lady Elmwood, I would never intrude again; but if you &s;uppo&s;e I cau&s;ed him to think upon his daughter, I cannot go too often."</P>
<P>"I don't &s;ee how he can divide tho&s;e two objects in his mind," replied Sandford, "and therefore you mu&s;t e'en vi&s;it him on, and take your chance, what reflections you may in&s;pire; but, be they what they will, time will take away from you that power of affecting him."</P>
<P>She concurred in the opinion, and occa&s;ionally walked in his lord&s;hip's apartments, dined, or took coffee with him, as the accident &s;uited; and ob|&s;erved according to Sandford's pre&s;cience, that time wore off that impre&s;&s;ion her vi&s;its fir&s;t made.&mdash;Lord Elmwood now became ju&s;t the &s;ame before her, as before others.&mdash;She ea&s;ily di&s;cerned, too, through all that politene&s;s which he a&s;&s;umed&mdash;he was no longer the con&s;iderate, the forbearing cha|racter he formerly was; but haughty, impatient, imperious, and more than ever, implacable.</P>

<P>WHEN Lord Elmwood had been at his country &s;eat about &s;ix weeks, Mr. Ru&s;hbrook, his nephew, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> adopted child, the friendle&s;s boy whom poor Lady Elmwood fir&s;t introduced into his
<PB N="246" REF="025650_0248_0FCEB2DF0BA25908">
uncle's hou&s;e, and by her kindne&s;s pre&s;erved there&mdash;arrived from his travels, and was received by his lord&s;hip with all that affectionate warmth due to the man he thought worthy to make his heir. Ru&s;h|brook had been a beautiful boy, and was now an extremely hand&s;ome young man; he had made an unu&s;ual progre&s;s in his &s;tudies, had completed the tour of Italy and Germany, and returned home with the air and addre&s;s of a perfect man of fa&s;hion&mdash;there was, be&s;ide, an elegance and per&s;ua&s;ion in his manner almo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tible.&mdash;Yet with all tho&s;e accompli&s;hments, when he was introduced to Sand|ford, and put out his hand to take his, Sandford, with evident reluctance, gave it to him; and when Lord Elmwood a&s;ked him in the young man's pre|&s;ence, "if he did not think his nephew greatly improved?" He looked at him from head to foot, and muttered, "he could not &s;ay be ob&s;erved it." The colour heightened in Mr. Ru&s;hbrook's face upon this occa&s;ion, but he was too well bred not to be &s;till in perfect good humour.</P>
<P>Sandford &s;aw this young man treated in the hou&s;e of Lord Elmwood with the &s;ame re&s;pect and at|tention, as if he had been his lord&s;hip's &s;on; and it was but probable the old prie&s;t &s;hould make a compari&s;on between the &s;ituation of him, and of Lady Matilda Elmwood.&mdash;Before her, it was Sand|ford's meaning to have concealed his thoughts upon the &s;ubject, and never to have mentioned it but with compo&s;ure; that was, however, impo&s;&s;ible&mdash;unu&s;ed to conceal his feelings; at the name of Ru&s;hbrook, his countenance would always change, and a &s;arca&s;tic &s;neer, and &s;ometimes a frown of re|&s;entment, force their way in &s;pite of his re&s;olution.&mdash;Mi&s;s Woodley, too, with all her boundle&s;s cha|rity and good will, was, upon this occa&s;ion, in|duced to limit their exce&s;s; and they did not ex|tend &s;o far as to reach poor Ru&s;hbrook&mdash;She even,
<PB N="247" REF="025650_0249_0FCEB2AC554BC458">
and in <HI>reality,</HI> did not think him hand&s;ome or en|gaging in his manners&mdash;&s;he thought his gaiety fri|volou&s;ne&s;s, his complai&s;ance affectation, and his good humour impertinence.&mdash;It was impo&s;&s;ible to conceal tho&s;e unfavourable &s;entiments entirely from Matilda; for when the &s;ubject aro&s;e, as it frequently did, Mi&s;s Woodley's undi&s;gui&s;ed heart, and Sand|ford's undi&s;gui&s;ed countenance, told them in&s;tantly.&mdash;Matilda had the under&s;tanding to imagine, &s;he was, perhaps, the object who had thus deformed Mr. Ru&s;hbrook, and frequently (though he was a &s;tranger to her, and one who had cau&s;ed her many a jealous heart-ach) frequently &s;he would &s;peak in his vindication.</P>
<P>"You are very good," &s;aid Sandford one day to her; "you like him becau&s;e you know your father loves him."</P>
<P>This was a hard &s;entence to the daughter of Lord Elmwood, to whom her father's love would have been more precious than any other ble&s;&s;ing&mdash;She, however, checked the a&s;&s;ault of envy, and kindly replied,</P>
<P>"My mother loved him, too, Mr. Sandford."</P>
<P>"Yes," an&s;wered Sandford, "he has been a grateful man to your poor mother&mdash;She did not &s;uppo&s;e when the took him into the hou&s;e, when &s;he intreated your father to take him, and through her care&s;&s;es and officious prai&s;es of him to his uncle, fir&s;t give him that power he now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es over him; &s;he little fore&s;aw, at that time, his ingratitude, and its effects."</P>
<P>"Very true," &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley, with a heavy &s;igh.</P>
<P>"What ingratitude?" &s;aid Matilda; "do you &s;uppo&s;e Mr. Ru&s;hbrook is the cau&s;e my father will not &s;ee me? Oh do not pay Lord Elmwood's mo|tives &s;o ill a compliment."</P>
<P>"I do not &s;ay he is the ab&s;olute cau&s;e," returned
<PB N="248" REF="025650_0250_0FCEB2E2B3EF5578">
Sandford; "but if a parent's heart is void, I would have it remain &s;o, till &s;tored by its lawful owner&mdash;a u&s;urper I dete&s;t."</P>
<P>"No one can take Lord Elmwood's heart by force," replied his daughter, "it mu&s;t, I believe, be a free gift to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or; and as &s;uch, whoever has it, has a right to it."</P>
<P>In this manner &s;he would plead the young man's excu&s;e&mdash;perhaps but to hear what could be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">id in his disfavour, for &s;ecretly his name was bitter to her&mdash;and once &s;he exclaimed in vexation, on Sand|ford's &s;aying Lord Elmwood and Mr. Ru&s;hbrook were gone out &s;hooting together,</P>
<P>"All that plea&s;ure is now eclip&s;ed, which I u&s;ed to take in li&s;tening to the report of my father's gun; for I cannot now di&s;tingui&s;h his, from his para&s;ite's."</P>
<P>Sandford, much as he di&s;liked Ru&s;hbrook&mdash;for this expre&s;&s;ion which compri&s;ed her father in the reflection, turned to Matilda in extreme anger; but as he &s;aw the colour mount to her face, for what, in the &s;trong feelings of her heart, had e&s;caped her lips, he did not &s;ay a word&mdash;and by a flood of tears that followed after, he rejoiced to &s;ee how much &s;he reproved her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley, vext to the heart, and provoked every time &s;he &s;aw Lord Elmwood and Ru&s;hbrook together, and &s;aw the familiar terms on which this young man lived with his benefactor, now made her vi&s;its to his lord&s;hip very &s;eldom.&mdash;If Lord Elm|wood ob&s;erved this, he did not appear to ob&s;erve it; and though he received her very politely when &s;he did pay him a vi&s;it, it was always very coldly; nor did &s;he &s;uppo&s;e if &s;he never went, he would ever a&s;k for her. For his daughter's &s;ake, how|ever, &s;he thought it right &s;ometimes to &s;how her|&s;elf before him; for &s;he knew it mu&s;t be impo&s;&s;ible that, with all his &s;eeming indifference, Lord Elm|wood
<PB N="249" REF="025650_0251_0FCEB2AD741BFF10">
could ever &s;ee her without thinking for a mo|ment on his child; and what one fortunate thought might &s;ometime bring about, was an object too &s;e|rious for her to &s;light.&mdash;She therefore, after re|maining confined to her apartments near three weeks, (excepting tho&s;e &s;hort and anxious walks &s;he and Matilda &s;tole, while Lord Elmwood dined, or before he ro&s;e in a morning) went one forenoon into his lord&s;hip's apartments, where as u&s;ual, &s;he found him, Mr. Sandford, and Mr. Ru&s;hbrook.&mdash;After &s;he had &s;at about half an hour, conver&s;ing with them all, though but very little with the lat|ter, his lord&s;hip was called out of the room upon &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s; pre&s;ently after Sandford; and now, not much plea&s;ed with the companion with whom &s;he was left, &s;he ro&s;e and was going likewi&s;e, when Ru&s;hbrook fixed his &s;peaking eyes upon her, and cried,</P>
<P>"Mi&s;s Woodley, will you pardon me what I am going to &s;ay?"</P>
<P>"Certainly, Sir&mdash;You can, I am &s;ure, &s;ay no|thing but what I mu&s;t forgive."&mdash;But &s;he made this reply with a di&s;tance and re&s;erve, very unlike the u&s;ual manner of Mi&s;s Woodley.</P>
<P>He looked at her earne&s;tly, and cried, "Ah! Mi&s;s Woodley, you don't behave &s;o kindly to me as you u&s;ed to do!"</P>
<P>"I do not under&s;tand you, Sir,"&mdash;&s;he replied, very gravely;&mdash;"Times are changed, Mr. Ru&s;h|brook, &s;ince you were la&s;t here&mdash;you were then but a child."</P>
<P>"Yet I love all tho&s;e per&s;ons now, I loved then;" replied he; "and &s;o I &s;hall for ever."</P>
<P>"But you mi&s;take, Mr. Ru&s;hbrook; I was not even then &s;o very much the object of your affections&mdash;there were other ladies you loved better.&mdash;Per|haps you don't remember Lady Elmwood?"</P>
<P>"Don't I?" cried he, "Oh!" (cla&s;ping his
<PB N="250" REF="025650_0252_0FCEB2E435426E10">
hands and lifting up his eyes to heaven) "&s;hall I ever forget her?"</P>
<P>That moment Lord Elmwood opened the door; the conver&s;ation of cour&s;e that moment ended; but confu&s;ion at the &s;udden &s;urpri&s;e was on the face of both the parties&mdash;his lord&s;hip &s;aw it, and looked at each by turns, with a &s;ternne&s;s that made poor Mi&s;s Woodley ready to faint; while Ru&s;h|brook, with the mo&s;t natural and happy laugh that ever was affected, cried, "No, don't tell my lord, pray, Mi&s;s Woodley." She was more con|fu&s;ed than before; and his lord&s;hip turning to him, a&s;ked what the &s;ubject was.&mdash;By this time he had invented one, and continuing his laugh, &s;aid, "Mi&s;s Woodley, my lord, will to this day prote&s;t &s;he &s;aw my apparition when I was a boy; and &s;he &s;ays it is a &s;ign I &s;hall die young, and is really much affected at it."</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood turned away before this ridiculous &s;peech was concluded; yet &s;o well had it been acted, he did not for an in&s;tant doubt its truth.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley felt her&s;elf greatly relieved; and yet &s;o little is it in the power of tho&s;e we di&s;like to do any thing to plea&s;e us, that from this very circum&s;tance, &s;he formed a &s;till more unfavourable opinion of Mr. Ru&s;hbrook than &s;he had done before.&mdash;She &s;aw in this little incident the art of di&s;&s;imulation, cunning, and duplicity in its mo&s;t glaring &s;hape; and dete&s;ted the method by which they had each e&s;caped Lord Elmwood's &s;u&s;picion, and perhaps anger, the more, becau&s;e it was &s;o dexterou&s;ly managed.</P>
<P>Lady Matilda and Sandford were both in their turns informed of this trait in Mr. Ru&s;hbrook's character; and although Mi&s;s Woodley had the be&s;t of di&s;po&s;itions, and upon every occa&s;ion &s;poke the &s;tricte&s;t truth; yet in relating this occurrence,
<PB N="251" REF="025650_0253_0FCEB2AF0080E800">
&s;he did not &s;peak all the truth; for every circum|&s;tance that would have told to the young man's ad|vantage, <HI>literally</HI> &s;lipped her memory.</P>
<P>The twenty-ninth of October arrived; on which a dinner, a ball, and a &s;upper, was given by Lord Elmwood to all the neighbouring gentry&mdash;the pea&s;ants al&s;o dined in the park off a roa&s;ted bul|lock; &s;everal ca&s;ks of ale were di&s;tributed, and the bells of the village rung.&mdash;Matilda, who heard and &s;aw &s;ome part of this fe&s;tivity from her windows, inquired the cau&s;e; but even the &s;ervant who waited upon her had too much &s;en&s;ibility to tell her, and an&s;wered, "he did not know." Mi&s;s Woodley, however, &s;oon learnt the rea&s;on, and groaning with the painful &s;ecret, informed her, "Mr. Ru&s;hbrook on that day was come of age."</P>
<P>"My birth-day was la&s;t week," replied Matilda; but not a word be&s;ide.</P>
<P>In their retired apartments, the day pa&s;&s;ed away not only &s;oberly, but almo&s;t &s;ilently; for to &s;peak upon any &s;ubject that did not engage their thoughts had been difficult, and to &s;peak upon the only one that did, had been afflictive.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as they were &s;itting down to dinner, their bell gently rung, and in walked Sandford.</P>
<P>"Why are you not among the revellers, Mr. Sandford?" cried Mi&s;s Woodley, with an ironical &s;neer&mdash;(the fir&s;t her features ever wore)&mdash;"Pray, were not you invited to dine with the compa|ny?"</P>
<P>"Yes," replied Sandford; but my head aked; and &s;o I had rather come and take a bit with you."</P>
<P>"Matilda, as if &s;he had beheld his heart as he &s;poke, clung round his neck and &s;obbed on his bo|&s;om: he put her peevi&s;hly away, crying, "Non&s;en&s;e, non&s;en&s;e&mdash;eat your dinner." But he did not eat him&s;elf.</P>

<P>ABOUT a week after this, Lord Elmwood went out two days for a vi&s;it: con&s;equently Ru&s;h|brook was for that time ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e. The fir&s;t morning he went a &s;hooting, and returning about noon, inquired of Sandford, who was &s;itting in the room, if he had taken up a volume of plays left upon the table&mdash;"I read no &s;uch things," re|plied Sandford, and quitted the room abruptly.&mdash;Ru&s;hbrook then rung for his &s;ervant, and de&s;ired him to look for the book, a&s;king him angrily, "Who had been in the apartment? for he was &s;ure he had left it there when he went out."&mdash;The &s;ervant withdrew to inquire, and pre&s;ently returned with the volume in his hand, and "Mi&s;s Woodley's compliments, &s;he begs your pardon, Sir, &s;he did not know the book was yours, and hopes you will excu&s;e the liberty &s;he took."</P>
<P>"Mi&s;s Woodley!" cried Ru&s;hbrook, with &s;ur|pri&s;e, "&s;he comes &s;o &s;edom into the&s;e apartments, I did not &s;uppo&s;e it was her who had it&mdash;take it back to her in&s;tantly, with my re&s;pects, and I beg &s;he will keep it."</P>
<P>The man went; but returned with the book again, and laying it on the table without &s;peaking, was going away; when Ru&s;hbrook, hurt at re|ceiving no &s;econd me&s;&s;age, &s;aid, "I am afraid, Sir, you did very wrong in taking this book from Mi&s;s Woodley."</P>
<P>"It was not from her I took it, Sir," replied the man, "it was from Lady Matilda."</P>
<P>Since he had entered the hou&s;e, Ru&s;hbrook had never before heard her name&mdash;he was &s;hocked&mdash;confounded more than ever&mdash;and to conceal what
<PB N="253" REF="025650_0255_0FCEB2B25BB75A28">
he felt, in&s;tantly ordered the man out of the room.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Mi&s;s Woodley and Matilda were talking over this trifling occurrence; and frivolous as it was, drew from it &s;trong conclu&s;ions of Ru&s;hbrook's in&s;olence and power.&mdash;In &s;pite of her pride, the daughter of Lord Elmwood even wept at the in&s;ult &s;he had received on this in&s;ignifi|cant occa&s;ion; for the volume being merely taken from her at Mr. Ru&s;hbrook's command, &s;he felt an in&s;ult; and the manner in which it was done by the &s;ervant, might contribute to the offence.</P>
<P>While Mi&s;s Woodley and &s;he were upon this con|ver&s;ation, a note came from Ru&s;hbrook to Mi&s;s Woodley, wherein he intreated that he might be permitted to &s;ee her.&mdash;She &s;ent a verbal an&s;wer, "She was engaged." He &s;ent again, begging &s;he would name her own time. But certain of a &s;e|cond denial, he followed the &s;ervant who took the la&s;t me&s;&s;age, and as Mi&s;s Woodley came out of her apartment into the gallery to &s;peak to him, Ru&s;h|brook pre&s;ented him&s;elf, and told the man to re|tire.</P>
<P>"Mr. Ru&s;hbrook," &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley, "this intru&s;ion is in&s;upportable;&mdash;and de&s;titute as you may think me of the friend&s;hip of Lord Elm|wood"&mdash;</P>
<P>In the ardour with which Ru&s;hbrook was waiting to expre&s;s him&s;elf, he interrupted her, and caught hold of her hand.</P>
<P>She immediately &s;natched it from him, and with|drew into her chamber.</P>
<P>He followed, &s;aying, in a low voice, "Dear Mi&s;s Woodley, hear me."</P>
<P>At that juncture Lady Matilda, who was in an inner room, came out of it into Mi&s;s Woodley's.&mdash;Perceiving a gentleman, &s;he &s;topped &s;hort at the door.</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="025650_0256_0FCEB2EB51A50F30">
Ru&s;hbrook ca&s;t his eyes upon her, and &s;tood motionle&s;s&mdash;his lips only moved. "Do not depart, Madam," &s;aid he, "without hearing my apology for being here."</P>
<P>Though Matilda had never &s;een him &s;ince her infancy, there was no cau&s;e to tell her who it was that addre&s;&s;ed her&mdash;his elegant and youthful per|&s;on, joined to the incident which had ju&s;t occurred, convinced her it was Ru&s;hbrook; and &s;he looked at him with an air of &s;urpri&s;e, but with &s;till more, of dignity.</P>
<P>"Mi&s;s Woodley is &s;evere upon me, Madam," con|tinued he, "&s;he judges me unkindly; and I am afraid &s;he will prepo&s;&s;e&s;s you with the &s;ame unfa|vourable &s;entiments."</P>
<P>Still Matilda did not &s;peak, but looked at him with the &s;ame air of dignity.</P>
<P>"If, Lady Matilda," re&s;umed he, "I have of|fended you, and mu&s;t quit you without pardon, I am more unhappy than I &s;hould be with the lo&s;s of your father's protection&mdash;more forlorn, than when an orphan boy, your mother fir&s;t took pity on me."</P>
<P>At this la&s;t &s;entence, Matilda turned her eyes on Mi&s;s Woodley, and &s;eemed in doubt what reply &s;he was to give.</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook immediately fell upon his knees&mdash;"Oh! Lady Matilda," cried he, "if you knew the &s;en&s;ations of my heart, you would not treat me with this di&s;dain."</P>
<P>"We can only judge of tho&s;e &s;en&s;ations, Mr. Ru&s;hbrook," &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley, "by the effect they have upon your conduct; and while you in&s;ult Lord and Lady Elmwood's daughter by an intru&s;ion like this, and then ridicule her abject &s;tate by mock|ery, &s;uch as the pre&s;ent"&mdash;</P>
<P>He flew from his knees in&s;tantly, and interrupt|ing her, crying, "What can I do?&mdash;What am I to &s;ay, to make you change your opinion of me?&mdash;
<PB N="255" REF="025650_0257_0FCEB2B3B10502E0">
While Lord Elmwood has been at home, I have kept at an awful di&s;tance; and though every mo|ment I breathed, was a wi&s;h to ca&s;t my&s;elf at his daughter's feet; yet as I feared, Mi&s;s Woodley, you were incen&s;ed again&s;t me, by what means was I to procure an interview, but by &s;tratagem or force?&mdash;This accident has given a third method, and I had not &s;trength, I had not courage, to let it pa&s;s.&mdash;Lord Elmwood will &s;oon return, and we may both be hurried to town immediately;&mdash;then how for a tedious winter, could I &s;u&s;tain the thought that I was de&s;pi&s;ed, nay perhaps con&s;idered as an object of ingratitude, by the only child of my decea&s;ed bene|factre&s;s?"</P>
<P>Matilda replied with all her father's haughtine&s;s, "Depend upon it, Sir, if you &s;hould ever enter my thoughts, it will only be as an object of envy."</P>
<P>"Suffer me then, Madam," &s;aid he, "as an earne&s;t you do not think wor&s;e of me than I me|rit, &s;uffer me to be &s;ometimes admitted into your pre&s;ence."</P>
<P>She &s;carcely permitted him to fini&s;h the period, before &s;he replied, "This is the la&s;t time, Sir, we &s;hall ever meet, depend upon it&mdash;unle&s;s, indeed, Lord Elmwood &s;hould delegate to you the control of me&mdash;his commands I never di&s;pute." And here &s;he bur&s;t into a flood of tears.</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook walked to the window, and did not &s;peak for a &s;hort time&mdash;then turning him&s;elf to make a reply, both Matilda and Mi&s;s Woodley were &s;omewhat &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee, he had &s;hed tears too.&mdash;Having conquered them, he &s;aid, "I will not offend you, Madam, by &s;taying one moment longer; and I give my honour, that, upon no pretence whatever, will I pre&s;ume to intrude here again.&mdash;Profe&s;&s;ions, I find, have no weight, and only by this obedience to your orders can I give a proof of
<PB N="256" REF="025650_0258_0FCEB2EC780D1348">
that re&s;pect which you in&s;pire;&mdash;and let the agita|tion I now feel, convince you, Lady Matilda, that, with all my &s;eeming good fortune, I am not hap|pier than your&s;elf."&mdash;And &s;o much was he agitated while he delivered this, it was with difficulty he came to the conclu&s;ion.&mdash;When he did, he bowed with reverence, as if he had left the pre&s;ence of a deity, and went away.</P>
<P>Matilda immediately entered the chamber &s;he had come from, and without ca&s;ting a &s;ingle look at Mi&s;s Woodley, by which &s;he might gue&s;s of the opinion &s;he had formed of Mr. Ru&s;hbrook's conduct.&mdash;The next time they met, they did not even mention his name; for they were a&s;hamed to own any partiality in his favour, and were too ju&s;t to bring any &s;erious accu&s;ation again&s;t him.</P>
<P>But Mi&s;s Woodley the day following communi|cated the intelligence of this vi&s;it to Mr. Sandford, who not being pre&s;ent, and a witne&s;s of tho&s;e marks of humility and re&s;pect which were con&s;pi|cuous in the deportment of Mr. Ru&s;hbrook, was highly offended at his pre&s;umption; and threatened if he ever dared to force his company there again, he would acquaint Lord Elmwood with his arro|gance, whatever might be the event.&mdash;Mi&s;s Wood|ley, however, a&s;&s;ured him, &s;he believed he would have no cau&s;e for &s;uch a complaint, as the young man had made the mo&s;t &s;olemn promi&s;e never to commit the like offence; and &s;he thought it her duty to enjoin Sandford, till he did repeat it, not to mention the circum&s;tance, even to Ru&s;hbrook him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Matilda could not but feel a regard towards her father's heir, in return for that which he had &s;o fervently declared for her; yet the more favourable her opinion of his mind and manners, the more he became a proper object of her jealou&s;y for the af|fections of Lord Elmwood, and was now con&s;e|quently
<PB N="257" REF="025650_0259_0FCEB2B4F5ADB6E8">
an object of greater &s;orrow to her, than when &s;he believed him le&s;s worthy.&mdash;This, was the rever&s;e on his part towards her&mdash;no jealou&s;y inter|vened to bar his admiration and e&s;teem, and the beauty of her per&s;on, and grandeur of her mien, not only confirmed, but improved, the exalted idea he had formed of her previous to their meeting, and which his affection to both her parents had in|&s;pired.&mdash;The next time he &s;aw his benefactor, he began to feel a new e&s;teem and regard for him, for his daughter's &s;ake; as he had at fir&s;t an e&s;teem for her on the foundation of his love for Lord and Lady Elmwood&mdash;He gazed with wonder at his un|cle's in&s;en&s;ibility to his own happine&s;s, and longed to lead him to the jewel he ca&s;t away, though even his own expul&s;ion &s;hould be the fatal con&s;equence.&mdash;Such was the youthful, warm; generous, grate|ful, but unthinking mind of Ru&s;hbrook.</P>

<P>AFTER this incident, Mi&s;s Woodley left her own apartments le&s;s frequently than before&mdash;&s;he was afraid, though till now mi&s;tru&s;t had been a &s;tranger to her heart, &s;he was afraid duplicity might be concealed under the apparent friend&s;hip of Ru&s;h|brook; it did not indeed appear &s;o from any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">t of his behaviour, but &s;he was apprehen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> affirm the fate of Matilda; &s;he di&s;liked him al&s;o, and there|fore &s;he &s;u&s;pected him.&mdash;For near three weeks &s;he had not now paid a vi&s;it to Lord Elmwood, and though to her&s;elf every vi&s;it was a pain, yet as Ma|tilda took a delight in hearing of her father, what
<PB N="258" REF="025650_0260_0FCEB2EDF40D0AF0">
he &s;aid, what he did, what his attention &s;eemed mo&s;tly employed on, and a thou&s;and other circum|&s;tantial informations, in the detail of which, Sand|ford would &s;corn to be half &s;o particular, it was a deprivation to her, Mi&s;s Woodley did not go of|tener.&mdash;Now to the middle of November had ar|rived, and it was expected his lord&s;hip would &s;hortly quit the country.</P>
<P>Partly therefore to indulge her haple&s;s compa|nion, and partly becau&s;e it was a nece&s;&s;ary duty, Mi&s;s Woodley paid his lord&s;hip a morning vi&s;it, and &s;taid dinner.&mdash;Ru&s;hbrook was officiou&s;ly polite to her, (for that was the epithet &s;he gave his atten|tion in relating it to Lady Matilda) yet &s;he owned he had not that forward impertinence &s;he had for|merly di&s;covered in him, but appeared much more grave and &s;edate.</P>
<P>"But tell me of my father," &s;aid Matilda.</P>
<P>"I was going, my dear&mdash;but don't be concerned&mdash;don't let it vex you."</P>
<P>"What? what?" cried Matilda, frightened by the preface.</P>
<P>"Why, on my ob&s;erving that I thought Mr. Ru&s;hbrook looked paler than u&s;ual, and appeared not to be in perfect health, (which was really the ca&s;e) your father expre&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t anxiety imaginable; he &s;aid he could not bear to &s;ee him look &s;o ill, begged him with all the tenderne&s;s of a parent, to take the advice of a phy&s;ician, and added a thou&s;and other affectionate things."</P>
<P>"I dete&s;t Mr. Ru&s;hbrook,"&mdash;&s;aid Matilda, with her eyes fla&s;hing indignation.</P>
<P>"Nay, for &s;hame," returned Mi&s;s Woodley: "do you &s;uppo&s;e I told you this, to make you hate him?"</P>
<P>"No, there was no occa&s;ion for that," replied Matilda; "my &s;entiments (though I had never be|fore avowed them) were long ago formed; he was
<PB N="259" REF="025650_0261_0FCEB2B8936D3888">
always an object which added to my unhappine&s;s; but &s;ince his daring intru&s;ion into my apartments, he has been an object of my hatred."</P>
<P>"But now perhaps I may tell you &s;omething to plea&s;e you," cried Mi&s;s Woodley.</P>
<P>"And what is that?" &s;aid Matilda, with indif|ference; for the fir&s;t intelligence had hurt her &s;pirits too much to &s;uffer her to li&s;ten with plea&s;ure to any other.</P>
<P>"Mr Ru&s;hbrook," continued Mi&s;s Woodley, replied to your father, "his indi&s;po&s;ition was but a &s;light nervous fever, and he would defer a phy&s;i|cian's advice till he went to London&mdash;on which his lord&s;hip &s;aid, "And when do you expect to be there?"&mdash;he replied, "Within a week or two, I &s;uppo&s;e, my lord." But your father an&s;wered, "I do not mean to go my&s;elf till after Chri&s;tmas."&mdash;"No indeed, my lord!" &s;aid Mr. Sandford, with &s;urpri&s;e: "you have not pa&s;&s;ed your Chri&s;tmas here," continued he, "the&s;e many a year."&mdash;"No," returned his lord&s;hip; "but I think my&s;elf more attached to this hou&s;e at pre&s;ent, than ever I did in my life."</P>
<P>"You imagine then, my father thought of me, when he &s;aid that?" cried Matilda eagerly.</P>
<P>"But I may be mi&s;taken," replied Mi&s;s Woodley.&mdash;"I leave you to judge.&mdash;But I am &s;ure Mr. Sand|ford imagined he thought of you, for I &s;aw a &s;mile over his whole face immediately."</P>
<P>"Did you, Mi&s;s Woodley?"</P>
<P>"Yes; it appeared on every feature except his lips; tho&s;e he clo&s;ed fa&s;t together, for fear Lord Elmwood &s;hould perceive it."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley with all her minute intelligence, did not however acquaint Matilda that Ru&s;hbrook followed her to the window while his lord&s;hip was out of the room, and Sandford half a&s;leep at the other end of it, and inquired re&s;pectfully and anxi|ou&s;ly
<PB N="260" REF="025650_0262_0FCEB2F1F29AECF0">
for her Lady&s;hip; adding, "It is my concern for Lady Matilda, which makes me thus indi&s;po&s;ed: I &s;uffer more than her; but I am not permitted to tell her &s;o, nor can I hope, Mi&s;s Woodley, you will."&mdash;She replied, "You are right, Sir." Nor did &s;he reveal this conver&s;ation, while not a &s;entence that pa&s;&s;ed except that, was omitted.</P>
<P>When Chri&s;tmas arrived, Lord Elmwood had many convivial days at Elmwood Hou&s;e; but the name of Matilda was never mentioned by one of his gue&s;ts, and mo&s;t probably was never thought of.&mdash;During all tho&s;e holidays &s;he was unu&s;ually me|lancholy, but &s;unk into the deepe&s;t dejection when &s;he was told the day was fixed on which her father was to depart for the &s;ea&s;on.&mdash;On the morning of that day &s;he wept ince&s;&s;antly; and all her con&s;ola|tion was, "She would go to the chamber window which was fronting the door he was to pa&s;s through to his carriage, and for the fir&s;t time, and mo&s;t likely for the la&s;t time of her life, behold him."</P>
<P>This de&s;ign was &s;oon forgot in another:&mdash;"She would ru&s;h boldly into the apartment where he was, and at his feet take leave of him for ever&mdash;She would lay hold of his hands, cla&s;p his knees, pro|voke him to &s;purn her, which would be joy in com|pari&s;on to this cruel indifference."&mdash;In the bitter|ne&s;s of her grief, &s;he once called upon her mother, and reproached her memory&mdash;but the moment &s;he recollected the offence (which was almo&s;t in&s;tanta|neou&s;ly) &s;he became all mildne&s;s and re&s;ignation. "What have I &s;aid?" cried &s;he; "Dear, dear &s;aint, forgive me, and behold for your &s;ake I will bear all with patience&mdash;I will not groan, I will not even &s;igh again&mdash;this ta&s;k I &s;et my&s;elf to atone for what I have dared to utter."</P>
<P>While Lady Matilda laboured under the&s;e variety of &s;en&s;ations, Mi&s;s Woodley was occupied in be|wailing and endeavouring to calm her &s;orrows&mdash;and
<PB N="261" REF="025650_0263_0FCEB2B9B558C0E8">
Lord Elmwood with Ru&s;hbrook, was prepared ready to &s;et off.&mdash;His lord&s;hip, however, loitered, and did not once &s;eem in ha&s;te to be gone.&mdash;When at la&s;t he got up to depart, Sandford thought he pre&s;&s;ed his hand, and &s;hook it with more warmth than ever he had done in his life.&mdash;Encouraged by this &s;uppo&s;ition, Sandford, with tears &s;tarting in his eyes, &s;aid, "my lord, won't you conde&s;cend to take your leave of Mi&s;s Woodley?"&mdash;"Certainly, Sandford," replied his lord&s;hip, and &s;eemed glad of an excu&s;e to &s;it down again.</P>
<P>Impre&s;&s;ed with the idea of the &s;tate in which &s;he had left his only child, Mi&s;s Woodley, when &s;he came before Lord Elmwood to bid him farewell, not pale, trembling, and in tears&mdash;Sandford, not|with&s;tanding his lord&s;hip's apparent kind humour, was &s;hocked at the con&s;truction he mu&s;t put upon her appearance, and cried, "What, Mi&s;s Wood|ley, are you not recovered of your illne&s;s yet." Lord Elmwood, however, took no notice of her looks, but after wi&s;hing her health and happine&s;s, walked &s;lowly out of the hou&s;e; turning back fre|quently and &s;peaking to Sandford or &s;ome other per&s;on who was behind him, as if part of his thoughts was left behind, and he went with reluc|tance.</P>
<P>When he had quitted the room where Mi&s;s Woodley was; Ru&s;hbrook, timid before her, as &s;he had been before her benefactor, went up to her all humility, and &s;aid, "Mi&s;s Woodley, we ought to be friends; our concern, our devotion, is paid to the &s;ame objects, and one common intere&s;t &s;hould teach us to be friendly."</P>
<P>She made no reply.&mdash;"Will you permit me to write to you when I am away?" &s;aid he; "You may wi&s;h to hear of Lord Elmwood's health, and of what changes may take place in his re&s;olutions&mdash;Will you permit me?"&mdash;At that moment a
<PB N="262" REF="025650_0264_0FCEB2F338F5C980">
&s;ervant came and &s;aid, "Sir, my lord is in the car|riage and waiting for you." He ha&s;ted away, and Mi&s;s Woodley was relieved from the pain of giving him a denial.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was the chariot, with all its attendants, out of &s;ight, than Lady Matilda was conducted by Mi&s;s Woodley from her lonely retreat, into that part of the hou&s;e from whence her father had ju&s;t departed&mdash;and &s;he vi&s;ited every &s;pot where he had &s;o long re&s;ided, with a plea&s;ing curio&s;ity that for a while diverted her grief.&mdash;In the breakfa&s;t and dining rooms, &s;he leaned over tho&s;e &s;eats with a kind of filial piety, on which &s;he was told he had been accu&s;tomed to &s;it. And in the library &s;he took up with filial delight, the pen with which he had been writing; and looked with the mo&s;t curi|ous attention into tho&s;e books that were laid upon his reading-de&s;k.&mdash;But a hat, laying on one of the tables, gave her a &s;en&s;ation beyond any other &s;he experienced on this occa&s;ion&mdash;in that trifling article of his dre&s;s, &s;he thought &s;he &s;aw he him&s;elf, and held it in her hand with pious reverence.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Lord Elmwood and Ru&s;hbrook were proceeding on their road with hearts not le&s;s heavy than tho&s;e which they had left at Elmwood Hou&s;e, though neither of them could &s;o well as Matilda, tell the cau&s;e of the weight.</P>

<P>YOUNG as Lady Matilda was during the life of her mother, neither her youth, nor the reclu&s;e &s;tate in which &s;he lived, had precluded her from the notice and &s;olicitations of a nobleman who had
<PB N="263" REF="025650_0265_0FCEB2BB0338C4A0">
profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf her lover. Vi&s;count Margrave had an e&s;tate not far di&s;tant from the retreat Lady Elmwood had cho&s;en, and being devoted to the &s;ports of the country, he &s;eldom quitted it for any of tho&s;e joys which the town afforded.&mdash;He was a young man, of a hand&s;ome per&s;on, and was what his neighbours &s;tyled "A man of &s;pirit."&mdash;He was an excellent fox-hunter, and as excellent a com|panion over his bottle at the end of the chace&mdash;he was prodigal of his fortune in all ca&s;es where his plea&s;ures were concerned, and as tho&s;e plea&s;ures were mo&s;tly &s;ocial, his &s;porting companions and his mi&s;tre&s;&s;es (for the&s;e were al&s;o of the plural number) partook largely of his wealth.</P>
<P>Two months previous to Lady Elmwood's death, Mi&s;s Woodley and Lady Matilda were taking their u&s;ual walk in &s;ome fields and lanes near to their hou&s;e, when chance threw Lord Margrave in their way, during a thunder &s;torm in which they were &s;uddenly caught; and he had the &s;atisfaction to convey his new acquaintances to their home in his carriage, &s;afe from the fury of the elements&mdash;Grateful for the &s;ervices his lord&s;hip had rendered them, Mi&s;s Woodley and her charge permitted him to inquire occa&s;ionally of their healths, and would &s;ometimes &s;ee him.&mdash;The &s;tory of Lady Elmwood was known to Lord Margrave, and as he beheld her daughter with a pa&s;&s;ion &s;uch as he had been unu&s;ed to overcome, he indulged it with the proba|ble hope, that on the death of the mother, Lord Elmwood would receive his child, and perhaps ac|cept him as his &s;on-in-law.&mdash;Wedlock was not the plan which Lord Margrave had ever propo&s;ed to him&s;elf for happine&s;s; but the exce&s;s of his love on this new occa&s;ion, &s;ubdued every re&s;olution he had taken again&s;t the marriage &s;tate, and not dar|ing to hope for the con&s;ummation of his wi&s;hes by any other means, he &s;uffered him&s;elf to look for|ward

to that, as his only re&s;ource.&mdash;No &s;ooner was the long-expected death of Lady Elmwood arrived, than his lord&s;hip waited with impatience to hear Lady Matilda was &s;ent for and acknowledged by her father; for he meant to be the fir&s;t to lay before Lord Elmwood his preten&s;ions as a &s;uitor.&mdash;But the&s;e preten&s;ions were founded on the vague hopes of a lover only; and Mi&s;s Woodley, to whom he fir&s;t declared them, &s;aid every thing po&s;&s;ible to con|vince him of their &s;alaciou&s;ne&s;s.&mdash;As to the object of his pa&s;&s;ion, &s;he was not only in&s;en&s;ible, but to|tally inattentive to all that was &s;aid to her on the &s;ubject.&mdash;Lady Elmwood died without ever being di&s;turbed with it; for her daughter did not even remember his propo&s;als &s;o as to repeat them again, and Mi&s;s Woodley thought it prudent to conceal from her friend, every new incident which might give her cau&s;e for fre&s;h anxieties.</P>
<P>When Sandford and the ladies left the north and came to Elmwood Hou&s;e, &s;o much were their thoughts employed with other ideas, Lord Mar|grave did not occupy a place; and during the whole time they had been at their new abode, they had never once heard of him.&mdash;He had, neverthele&s;s, his whole mind fixed upon Lady Matilda, and placed &s;pies in the neighbourhood to inform him of every circum&s;tance in her &s;ituation.&mdash;Having imbibed an aver&s;ion to matrimony, he heard with but little re|gret, that there was no pro&s;pect of her ever be|coming her father's heir; while &s;uch an informa|tion gave him the hope of obtaining her, upon the illegal terms of a mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood's departure to town forwarded this hope, and flattering him&s;elf that the humiliat|ing &s;ituation in which Matilda mu&s;t feel her&s;elf in the hou&s;e of her father, might gladly induce her to take &s;helter under any other protection, he boldly advanced as &s;oon as the earl was gone, to make &s;uch

overtures as his wi&s;hes and his vanity told him, could not be rejected.</P>
<P>Inquiring for Mi&s;s Woodley, he ea&s;ily gained admittance; but at the &s;ight of &s;o much mode&s;ty, and dignity in the per&s;on of Matilda, &s;o much good will, and yet &s;uch circum&s;pection in her com|panion; and the good &s;en&s;e and proper &s;pirit which were always apparent in the manners of Sandford, his lord&s;hip fell once more into the de&s;pondency, of becoming to Lady Matilda nothing more important to his reputation, than a hu&s;band.</P>
<P>Even that humble hope was, however, &s;ometimes denied him, while Sandford &s;et forth the impro|priety of troubling Lord Elmwood on &s;uch a &s;ub|ject at pre&s;ent; and while the vi&s;count's penetra|tion, &s;mall as it was, di&s;covered in his fair one, much more to di&s;courage than to favour his wi&s;hes.&mdash;Plunged, however, too deep in his pa&s;&s;ion, to emerge from it in ha&s;te, he meant &s;till to vi&s;it, and wait for a change to happier circum&s;tances, when he was peremptorily de&s;ired by Mr. Sandford, to de&s;i&s;t from ever coming again.</P>
<P>"Wherefore, Mr. Sandford?" cried his lord|&s;hip.</P>
<P>"For two rea&s;ons, my lord;&mdash;in the fir&s;t place, your vi&s;its might be di&s;plea&s;ing to Lord Elmwood;&mdash;in the next place, I know they are &s;o to his daughter."</P>
<P>Unaccu&s;tomed to be &s;poken to &s;o plainly, par|ticularly in a ca&s;e where his heart was intere&s;ted, his lord&s;hip neverthele&s;s &s;ubmitted with patience; but in his own mind determined how long this pati|ence &s;hould continue&mdash;no longer than it &s;erved as the means to prove his obedience, and by that ar|tifice, &s;ecure his better reception at &s;ome future pe|riod.</P>
<P>On his return home, cheered with the huzzas of his jovial companions, he began to con&s;ult his

friends, what &s;cheme was be&s;t to be adopted for the accompli&s;hment of his de&s;ires.&mdash;Some, boldly ad|vi&s;ed application to the father, in defiance to the old prie&s;t; but that was the very la&s;t method his lord&s;hip him&s;elf approved, as marriage mu&s;t inevi|tably have followed Lord Elmwood's con&s;ent; be|&s;ides, though a peer, Lord Margrave was unu&s;ed to rank with peers; and even the nece&s;&s;ary formality of an interview with one of his equals, carried along with it a terror, or at lea&s;t a fatigue, to a ru&s;tic baron.&mdash;Others of his companions, advi&s;ed &s;eduction; but happily his lord&s;hip po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no arts of this kind to affect a heart appendant to &s;uch a mind as Matilda's.&mdash;There were not wanting among his mo&s;t favourite coun&s;ellors, &s;ome who painted the triumph and gratification of force; tho&s;e a&s;|&s;ured him there was nothing to apprehend under this head; as from the behaviour of Lord Elm|wood to his child, it was more than probable he would be utterly indifferent to any violence that might be offered her.&mdash;This la&s;t advice &s;eemed in|&s;pired by the aid of wine; and no &s;ooner had the wine freely circulated, than this was always the &s;cheme which appeared by far the be&s;t.</P>
<P>While Lord Margrave alternately cheri&s;hed his hopes and his fears in the country, Ru&s;hbrook in town gave way to his fears only&mdash;every day of his life made him more acquainted with the firm, un|&s;haken temper of Lord Elmwood, and every day whi&s;pered more forcibly to his own heart, that pity, gratitude, and friend&s;hip, &s;trong and affectionate as the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions are, are weak and cold to that, which had gained the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of him&mdash;he doubted, but be did not long doubt, that which he felt was love.&mdash;"And yet," &s;aid he to him&s;elf, "it is love of hat kind, which ari&s;ing from cau&s;es independant of the object it&s;elf, can &s;carcely de&s;erve this &s;acred itle&mdash;Did I not love Lady Matilda before I beheld

Or &s;hould I have felt that &s;ympa|thetic tenderne&s;s which now preys upon my health, had not her misfortunes excited it?&mdash;no."&mdash;Yet the love which is the re&s;ult of gratitude and pity only, he thought had little claim to rank with his; and after the mo&s;t deliberate and deep reflection, he concluded with this deci&s;ive opinion&mdash;He had loved Lady Matilda, in <HI>whatever &s;tate,</HI> in <HI>whatever circum&s;tances;</HI> and that the tenderne&s;s he felt to|wards her, and the anxiety for her happine&s;s before he knew her, extreme as they were, were yet cool and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate &s;en&s;ations, compared to that which her per&s;on and demeanor had incited&mdash;and though he acknowledged, that by tho&s;e preceding &s;enti|ments his heart was &s;oftened, prepared, and moulded, as it were, to receive this la&s;t impre&s;&s;ion; yet the violence of his pa&s;&s;ion told him genuine love, if not the ba&s;is on which it was founded, had been the certain con&s;equence.&mdash;With a &s;trict &s;cru|tiny into his heart, he &s;ought this knowledge, but arrived at it with a regret that amounted to de&s;|pair.</P>
<P>To &s;hield him&s;elf from de&s;pondency, he formed in his mind a thou&s;and projects, depicting the joys of his union with Lady Matilda; but her father's im|placability &s;tood foremo&s;t, and confounded them all&mdash;His lord&s;hip was a man who made but few re|&s;olutions&mdash;tho&s;e were the effect of deliberation; and as he was not the lea&s;t capricious or incon&s;tant in his temper, they were re&s;olutions which no pro|bable event could &s;hake.&mdash;Love, that produces wonders&mdash;that &s;educes and &s;ubdues the mo&s;t deter|mined and rigid &s;pirits, had in two in&s;tances over|come the inflexibility of Lord Elmwood; he mar|ried

Lady Elmwood contrary to his determination, becau&s;e he loved; and for the &s;ake of this beloved object, he had, contrary to his re&s;olution, taken under his immediate care young Ru&s;hbrook; but the magic which once enchanted away this &s;pirit of immutability was no more&mdash;Lady Elmwood was no more, and the charm was broken.</P>
<P>As Mi&s;s Woodley was deprived the opportunity of de&s;iring Ru&s;hbrook not to write when he a&s;ked her the permi&s;&s;ion, he pa&s;&s;ed one whole morning in the gratification of forming and writing a letter to her, which he thought might po&s;&s;ibly be &s;hown to Matilda.&mdash;As he dur&s;t not touch upon any of tho&s;e circum&s;tances in which he was the mo&s;t inter|e&s;ted, that, joined to the re&s;pect he wi&s;hed to pay the lady to whom he wrote, limited his letter to about twenty lines; yet the &s;tudious manner with which the&s;e lines were dictated, the hope and fear they might, or might not, be &s;een and regarded by Lady Matilda, rendered the ta&s;k an anxiety &s;o plea|&s;ing, he could have wi&s;hed it to have la&s;ted for a year; and in all this magnifying of trifles was di&s;coverable, the never-failing &s;ymptom of ardent love.</P>
<P>A reply to this formal addre&s;s, was a reward he wi&s;hed for with impatience, but he wi&s;hed in vain; and in the mid&s;t of his chagrin at the di&s;appoint|ment, a &s;orrow little thought of, occurred, and gave him a perturbation of mind he had never be|fore experienced.&mdash;Lord Elmwood propo&s;ed a wife to him; and in a way &s;o a&s;&s;ured of his acquie&s;cence, that if Ru&s;hbrook's life had depended upon his daring to di&s;pute his benefactor's will, he would not have had the courage to have done &s;o. There was, however, in his reply, and his embarra&s;&s;ment, &s;omething which his lord&s;hip di&s;cerned from a free concurrence; and looking &s;tedfa&s;tly at him, he &s;aid, in that &s;tern manner which he now almo&s;t con|&s;tantly adopted,</P>

"You have no engagements, I &s;uppo&s;e? have made no previous promi&s;es?"</P>
<P>"None on earth, my lord," replied Ru&s;hbrook candidly.</P>
<P>"Nor have you di&s;po&s;ed of your heart?"</P>
<P>"No, my lord," replied he; but not candidly,&mdash;nor with the appearance of candour: for though he &s;poke ha&s;tily, it was rather like a man frightened than a&s;&s;ured.&mdash;He hurried to tell the fal&s;ehood he thought him&s;elf obliged to tell, that the pain and &s;hame might be over; but there Ru&s;hbrook was deceived; the lie once told was as trouble&s;ome as in the conception, and added to his fir&s;t confu&s;ion, an increa&s;ing one.</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood now fixed his eyes upon him with a &s;ullen contempt, and ri&s;ing from his &s;eat, &s;aid, "Ru&s;hbrook, if you have been &s;o incon&s;iderate as to give away your heart, tell me &s;o at once, and tell me the object."</P>

<P>"I here," continued his lord&s;hip, "tolerate the fir&s;t untruth you ever told me as the fal&s;e a&s;&s;ertion of a lover; and give you an opportunity to recall it&mdash;but after this moment, it is a lie between man and man&mdash;a lie to your friend and father, and I will not forgive it."</P>

The ab&s;olute orders he received from the &s;teward on his return from his travels, were, "Never to mention his daughter, any more than his late wife, before Lord Elmwood."&mdash;The fault of having rudely intruded into Lady Matilda's pre&s;ence, ru&s;hed too upon his mind; for he did not even dare to &s;ay, by what means he had beheld her.&mdash;But more than all, the threatening manner, in which his lord&s;hip uttered this rational and &s;eeming conciliating &s;peech, the menaces, the &s;everity which &s;at upon his counte|nance while he delivered tho&s;e moderate words, might have intimidated a man wholly independent, and le&s;s u&s;ed to fear him than his nephew had been.</P>
<P>"You make no an&s;wer, Sir?" &s;aid his lord&s;hip, after waiting a few moments for his reply.</P>
<P>"I have only to &s;ay, my lord," returned Ru&s;h|brook, "that although my heart may be totally di&s;|engaged, I may yet be di&s;inclined to the pro&s;pect of marriage."</P>
<P>"May! May! Your heart <HI>may</HI> be di&s;engaged," repeated his lord&s;hip. "Do you dare to reply to me equivocally, when I have a&s;ked a po&s;itive an|&s;wer?"</P>
<P>"Perhaps I am not po&s;itive my&s;elf, my lord; but I will inquire the &s;tate of my mind, and make you acquainted with it very &s;oon."</P>

"I give you a week to con&s;ult with your&s;elf; at the expiration of that time I &s;hall talk with you again, and I command you to be then prepared to &s;peak, not only without deceit, but without he&s;ita|tion." He left the room at the&s;e words, and left Ru&s;hbrook relea&s;ed from a fate which his appre|hen&s;ions had beheld impending that moment.</P>

<P>Undetermined how to act upon this great trial, which was to decide his future de&s;tiny, Ru&s;hbrook &s;uffered &s;o poignant an uncertainty, that he became at length ill, and before the end of the week which his uncle had allotted him for his reply, he was confined to his bed in a high fever.&mdash;His lord&s;hip was extremely affected at his indi&s;po&s;ition; he gave him every care he could be&s;tow, and even a great deal of his per&s;onal attendance.&mdash;This la&s;t favour had a claim upon the young man's gratitude, &s;upe|rior to every other obligation which &s;ince his in|fancy his benefactor had conferred; and he was at times &s;o moved by tho&s;e marks of kindne&s;s he re|ceived from Lord Elmwood, he would form the intention of tearing from his heart every trace Lady Matilda had left there, and as &s;oon as his health permitted him, obey to the utmo&s;t of his views, every wi&s;h his uncle had conceived.&mdash;Yet again, Matilda's pitiable &s;ituation pre&s;ented it&s;elf to his compa&s;&s;ion, and her beauteous per&s;on to his love.&mdash;Divided between the claims of obligation to the father, and tender attachment to the daughter, his &s;ickne&s;s was increa&s;ed by the tortures of his mind, and he once &s;incerely wi&s;hed for that death, of which he was in danger, to free him from the

<P>At the time his illne&s;s was at its height, and he lay complaining of the violence of his fever, Lord Elmwood, taking his hand, a&s;ked him, "If there was any thing he could do for him?"</P>
<P>"Yes, yes, my lord, a great deal," he replied eagerly.</P>
<P>"What is it, Harry?" a&s;ked his lord&s;hip, kindly.</P>
<P>"Oh! my lord," replied he, "that is what I mu&s;t not tell you."</P>
<P>"Defer it then till you are well," &s;aid his lord|&s;hip, fearful of being &s;urpri&s;ed, or affected by the &s;tate of his health, into any promi&s;es which he might hereafter find, the impropriety of granting.</P>
<P>"And when I recover, my lord, you give me leave to reveal to you, that which I wi&s;h you to comply with, let it be what it will?"</P>

<P>That Lord Elmwood could have no idea what was the real petition which Ru&s;hbrook meant to pre&s;ent him, is certain; but it is certain he expected he had &s;ome reque&s;t to make, with which it might be wrong for him to comply, and therefore he a|voided hearing what it was; for great as his com|pa&s;&s;ion for him in his pre&s;ent &s;tate, it was not of force to urge him to give a promi&s;e he did not mean to perform&mdash;Ru&s;hbrook on his part was plea&s;ed with the a&s;&s;urance he might &s;peak when he was re&s;tored to health, but no &s;ooner was his fever abated, and his &s;en&s;es perfectly recovered from the &s;light de|rangement his malady had cau&s;ed, than the lively remembrance of what he had hinted alarmed him,

<P>DURING the illne&s;s of Ru&s;hbrook, news had been &s;ent of his danger from the &s;ervants in town, to tho&s;e at Elmwood Hou&s;e, and Lady Ma|tilda expre&s;&s;ed compa&s;&s;ion when &s;he was told of it&mdash;&s;he began to conceive the in&s;tant &s;he thought he would &s;oon die, that his vi&s;it to her had &s;ome merit

rather than impertinence in its de&s;ign, and that he might po&s;&s;ibly be a more de&s;erving man than &s;he had &s;uppo&s;ed him to be. Even Sandford and Mi&s;s Woodley began to recollect qualifications he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed, which they never had reflected on before, and Mi&s;s Woodley in particular reproached her&s;elf that &s;he had been &s;o &s;evere and inattentive to him.&mdash;Notwith&s;tanding the pro&s;pects his death pointed out to her, it was with infinite joy &s;he heard he was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">; nor was Sandford le&s;s &s;atisfied; for he had treated the young man too unkindly not to dread, le&s;t any ill &s;hould befall him;&mdash;but al|though he was glad to hear of his re&s;tored health, when he was informed he was coming to Elmwood Hou&s;e for a few weeks in the &s;tyle of its ma&s;ter, Sandford, with all his religious and humane princi|ples, could not help thinking, "that provided the lad had been properly prepared, he had been as well out of the world as in it."</P>
<P>He was &s;till le&s;s his friend when he &s;aw him ar|rive with his u&s;ual florid appearance; had he come pale and &s;ickly, Sandford had been kind to him; but in apparent good health and &s;pirits, he could not form his mouth to tell him he was "glad to &s;ee him."</P>
<P>On his arrival, Matilda, who for five months had been at large, &s;ecluded her&s;elf as &s;he would have done upon the arrival of Lord Elmwood; but with far different &s;en&s;ations.&mdash;Notwith&s;tanding her re|&s;triction on the latter occa&s;ion, the re&s;idence of her father in that hou&s;e had been a &s;ource of plea&s;ure, rather than of &s;orrow to her; but from the abode of Ru&s;hbrook &s;he derived puni&s;hment alone,</P>
<P>When, from inquiries made to his own &s;ervant, who inquired again, Ru&s;hbrook found that on his approach Matilda had retired to her own confined apartments, the thought was torture to him; it was the hope of &s;eeing and conver&s;ing with her, of be|ing

admitted at all times to her &s;ociety as the mi&s;|tre&s;s of the hou&s;e, that had rai&s;ed his &s;pirits, and effected his perfect cure, beyond any other cau&s;e; and he was hurt to the greate&s;t degree at this re&s;pect, or rather contempt, &s;hown to him by her retreat.</P>
<P>It was, neverthele&s;s, a &s;ubject too delicate to touch upon in any one &s;en&s;e&mdash;an invitation for her company on his part, might carry the appearance of &s;uperior authority, and an affected conde&s;cen|&s;ion, which he ju&s;tly con&s;idered as the wor&s;t of all in&s;ults.&mdash;And yet, how could he &s;upport the idea that his vi&s;it had placed the daughter of his bene|factor as a dependant &s;tranger in that hou&s;e, where in reality he was the dependant, and &s;he the the lawful heir.&mdash;For two or three days he &s;uffered the torments of the&s;e reflections, hoping to come to an explanation of all he felt by a fortunate meet|ing with Mi&s;s Woodley; but when that meeting oc|curred, although he ob&s;erved &s;he talked to him with le&s;s re&s;erve than &s;he had formerly done, and even gave &s;ome proofs of the goodne&s;s of her di&s;po&s;ition, yet &s;he &s;crupulou&s;ly avoided naming Lady Matilda; and when he diffidently inquired of her lady&s;hip's health, a cold re&s;traint &s;pread over Mi&s;s Woodley's face, and &s;he left him in&s;tantly.&mdash;To Sandford it was &s;till more difficult to apply; for though they were frequently together, they were never &s;ociable; and as Sandford &s;eldom di&s;gui&s;ed his feelings, to Ru&s;hbrook he was always extremely &s;evere, and &s;ometimes unmannerly.</P>
<P>In this perplexed &s;ituation, the country air was rather of detriment than &s;ervice to the invalid; and had he not, like a true lover, held fa&s;t to hope, while he could perceive nothing but de&s;pair; he had returned to town, rather than by his &s;tay placed in a &s;ubordinate &s;tate the object of his adoration.&mdash;But &s;till per&s;i&s;ting in his hopes, he one morning met Mi&s;s Woodley in the garden, engaged her a

longer time than u&s;ual in conver&s;ation, and at la&s;t obtained her promi&s;e, "She would that day dine with him and Mr. Sandford."&mdash;But no &s;ooner had &s;he parted from him, than &s;he repented of her con|&s;ent, and upon communicating it to Matilda, that young lady, for the fir&s;t time in her life, darted upon her kind companion, a look of the mo&s;t cut|ting reproach and haughty re&s;entment.&mdash;Mi&s;s Woodley's own &s;entiments had upbraided her be|fore; but &s;he was not prepared to receive &s;o pointed a mark of di&s;approbation from her young friend, till now, duteous and humble to her as to a mother, and not le&s;s affectionate. Her heart was too &s;u&s;|ceptible to bear this di&s;re&s;pectful and contumelious frown from the object of her long-devoted care and concern; the tears in&s;tantly covered her face, and &s;he laid her hands upon her heart, as if &s;he thought it would break.&mdash;Matilda was moved, but &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed too much of the manly re&s;entment of her father, to di&s;cover what &s;he felt for the fir&s;t few minutes.&mdash;Mi&s;s Woodley, who had given &s;o many tears to her &s;orrows, but never till now, one to her anger, had a &s;till deeper &s;en&s;e of this indif|ference, than of the anger it&s;elf, and to conceal what &s;he &s;uffered, left the room.&mdash;Matilda, who had been till this time working at her needle, &s;eemingly compo&s;ed, now let her work drop from her hand, and &s;at for a little while in a deep reverie.&mdash;At length &s;he ro&s;e up, and followed Mi&s;s Wood|ley to the other apartment.&mdash;She entered grave, maje&s;tic, and apparently &s;erene, while her poor heart fluttered with a thou&s;and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;en&s;ati|ons.&mdash;She approached Mi&s;s Woodley (who was &s;till in tears) with a &s;ullen &s;ilence; and awed by her manners, the faithful friend of her decea&s;ed mo|ther exclaimed, "Dear Lady Matilda, think no more on what I have done&mdash;do not re&s;ent it any longer, and on my knees I'll beg your pardon."&mdash;
<PB N="277" REF="025650_0279_0FCEB2C936544F58">
Mi&s;s Woodley ro&s;e as &s;he uttered the&s;e la&s;t words; but Matilda laid fa&s;t hold of her to prevent the po&s;ture &s;he offered to take, and in&s;tantly a&s;&s;umed it her&s;elf, "Oh, let this be my atonement!" &s;he cried with the mo&s;t earne&s;t &s;upplication.</P>
<P>They interchanged forgivene&s;s; and as this re|conciliation was &s;incere, they each without re&s;erve gave their opinion upon the &s;ubject which had cau&s;ed the mi&s;under&s;tanding; and it was agreed that an apology &s;hould be &s;ent to Mr. Ru&s;hbrook, "That Mi&s;s Woodley had been &s;uddenly indi&s;po&s;|ed." Nor could this be &s;aid to differ from the truth, for &s;ince what had pa&s;&s;ed, &s;he was unfit to pay a vi&s;it.</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook, who had been all the morning elated with the advance he &s;uppo&s;ed he had made in that lady's favour, was highly di&s;appointed, vext, and angry when this apology was delivered to him; nor did he, nor perhaps could he, conceal what he felt, although his &s;evere ob&s;erver, Mr. Sandford, was pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>"I am a very unfortunate man," &s;aid he, as &s;oon as the &s;ervant was gone who brought the me&s;|&s;age.</P>
<P>Sandford ca&s;t his eyes upon him with a look of &s;urpri&s;e and contempt.</P>
<P>"A very unfortunate man indeed, Mr. Sandford," repeated he, "although you treat my complaint contemptuou&s;ly."</P>
<P>Sandford made no reply, and &s;eemed above mak|ing one.</P>
<P>They &s;at down to dinner;&mdash;Ru&s;hbrook &s;carce eat any thing, but drank, frequently; Sandford took no notice of either, but had a book (which was his cu&s;tom when he dined with per&s;ons who&s;e conver|&s;ation was not intere&s;ting to him) laid by the &s;ide of his plate, which he occa&s;ionally looked into, as

the di&s;hes were removing, or other opportunities &s;erved.</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook, ju&s;t now more hopele&s;s than ever of forming an acquaintance with Lady Matilda, began to give way to the &s;ymptoms of de&s;pair; and they made their fir&s;t attack by urging him to treat on the &s;ame level of familiarity that he him&s;elf was treated, Mr. Sandford, to whom he had till now ever be|haved with the mo&s;t profound tokens of re&s;pect.</P>
<P>"Come," &s;aid he to him as &s;oon as the dinner was removed, "Lay a&s;ide your book and be good company."</P>
<P>Sandford lifted up his eyes upon him&mdash;&s;tared in his face&mdash;and ca&s;t them on the book again.</P>
<P>"I &s;ay," continued Ru&s;hbrook, "I want a com|panion; and as Mi&s;s Woodley has di&s;appointed me, I mu&s;t have your company."</P>
<P>Sandford now laid down his book upon the table, but &s;till holding his &s;ingers in the pages he was reading, &s;aid, "And why are you di&s;appointed of Mi&s;s Woodley's company?&mdash;When people expect what they have no right to hope for, they have yet the a&s;&s;urance to complain they are di&s;appointed."</P>
<P>"I had a right to expect &s;he would come," an|&s;wered Ru&s;hbrook, "for &s;he promi&s;ed &s;he would."</P>
<P>"But what right had you to a&s;k her?"</P>
<P>"The right every one has, to make his time pa&s;s as agreeably as he can."</P>
<P>"But not at the expence of another."</P>
<P>"I believe, Mr. Sandford, it would be a heavy expence to you, to &s;ee me hapyy; I believe it would co&s;t you even your own happines."</P>
<P>"That is a price I have not now to give," re|plied Sandford, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e began reading again.</P>
<P>"What, you have already paid it away? No wonder that at your time of life it &s;hould be gone.&mdash;But what do you think of my having already &s;quandered mine?"</P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="025650_0281_0FCEB2CAB41C64A0">
"I don't think about you," returned Sandford, without taking his eyes from the book.</P>
<P>"Can you look me in the face and &s;ay that, Mr. Sandford?&mdash;No, you cannot&mdash;for you know you <HI>do</HI> think of me, and you know you hate me."&mdash;Here he drank two gla&s;&s;es of wine one after another; "And I can tell you why you hate me," continued he: "It is from a cau&s;e for which I often hate my&s;elf."</P>
<P>Sandford read on.</P>
<P>"It is on Lady Matilda's account you hate me, and u&s;e me thus."</P>
<P>Sandford put down his book ha&s;tily, and put both his hands by his &s;ide.</P>
<P>"Yes," re&s;umed Ru&s;hbrook, "you think I am wronging her."</P>
<P>"I think you gro&s;sly in&s;ult her," exclaimed Sand|ford, "by this rude mention of her name; and I command you at your peril to de&s;i&s;t."</P>
<P>"At my peril! Mr. Sandford? Do you a&s;&s;ume the authority of Lord Elmwood?"</P>
<P>"I do on this occa&s;ion; and if you dare to give your tongue a freedom"&mdash;</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook interrupted him&mdash;"Why then I boldly &s;ay, (and as her friend, you ought rather to applaud than re&s;ent it) I boldly &s;ay, my heart &s;uf|fers &s;o much for her &s;ituation, I am regardle&s;s of my own.&mdash;I love her father&mdash;I loved her mother more&mdash;but &s;he her&s;elf beyond either."</P>
<P>"Hold your licentious tongue," cried Sandford, "or quit the room."</P>
<P>"Licentious? Oh! the pure thoughts that dwell in her innocent mind, are not le&s;s &s;en&s;ual than mine towards her.&mdash;Do you upbraid me with my re&s;pect, my pity for her?

"In&s;ult <HI>me</HI> as you plea&s;e, Mr. Ru&s;hbrook,&mdash;but beware how you mention Lord Elmwood's daugh|ter."</P>
<P>"Can it be to her di&s;honour that I pity her? that I would quit the hou&s;e, this moment, never to return, &s;o &s;he &s;upplied the place I withhold from her."</P>
<P>"Go then," cried Sandford.</P>
<P>"It would be of no u&s;e to her, or I would&mdash;But come, Mr. Sandford, I will dare do as much as you.&mdash;Only &s;econd me, and I will intreat Lord Elm|wood to be reconciled&mdash;to &s;ee and own her."</P>
<P>"Your vanity would be equal to your ra&s;hne&s;s.&mdash;You intreat?&mdash;She mu&s;t greatly e&s;teem tho&s;e pa|rental, favours which your intreaties gained her!&mdash;Do you forget, young man, how &s;hort a time it is, &s;ince you were intreated for?"</P>
<P>"I prove I do not, while this anxiety for Lady Matilda, ari&s;es from what I feel on that account."</P>
<P>"Remove your anxiety, then, from her to your|&s;elf; for were I to let Lord Elmwood know what has pa&s;&s;ed now"&mdash;</P>
<P>"It is for your own &s;ake, not for mine, if you don't."</P>
<P>"You &s;hall not dare me to it, Mr. Ru&s;hbrook."&mdash;And he ro&s;e from his &s;eat: "You &s;hall not dare me to do you an injury.&mdash;But to avoid the tempta|tion, I will never again come into your company, unle&s;s my friend Lord Elmwood is pre&s;ent, to pro|tect me and his child from your in&s;ults."</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook ro&s;e in yet more warmth than Sand|ford. "Have you the inju&s;tice to &s;ay I have in|&s;ulted Lady Matilda?"</P>
<P>"To &s;peak of her at all, is in you an in&s;ult.&mdash;But you have done more&mdash;you dared to vi&s;it her&mdash;to force into her pre&s;ence, and &s;hock her with your offers of &s;ervices which &s;he &s;corns; and of your compa&s;&s;ion, which &s;he is far above."</P>
<P>"Did &s;he complain to you?"</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="025650_0283_0FCEB2CFCAD19F70">
"She, or her friend, did."</P>
<P>"I rather &s;uppo&s;e, Mr. Sandford, you have bribed &s;ome of the &s;ervants to reveal this."</P>
<P>"The &s;u&s;picion becomes Lord Elmwood's heir."</P>
<P>"It becomes the man who lives in a hou&s;e with you."</P>
<P>"I thank you, Mr. Ru&s;hbrook, for what has pa&s;&s;ed this day&mdash;it has taken a weight off my mind.&mdash;I thought my di&s;inclination to you, might per|haps ari&s;e from prejudice&mdash;this conver&s;ation has re|lieved me from tho&s;e fears, and I thank you."&mdash;Saying this, he calmly walked out of the room, and left Ru&s;hbrook to reflect on what he had been doing.</P>
<P>Heated with the wine he had drank, (and which Sandford engaged on his book had not ob&s;erved) no &s;ooner was he alone, than he became at once cool and repentant.&mdash;"What had he done?" was the fir&s;t que&s;tion to him&s;elf.&mdash;"He had offended Sandford."&mdash;The man whom rea&s;on as well as pru|dence had ever taught him to treat with re&s;pect and even reverence.&mdash;He had gro&s;sly offended the firm friend of Lady Matilda, and even by the unre|&s;erved, the wanton u&s;e of her name.&mdash;All the re|torts he had uttered came now to his memory; with a total forgetfulne&s;s of all Sandford had &s;aid to provoke them.</P>
<P>He once thought to follow him, and beg his par|don; but the contempt with which he had been treated, more than all the anger, withheld him.</P>
<P>As he &s;at forming plans how to retrieve the opi|nion, ill as it was, which Sandford formerly enter|tained of him, he received a letter from Lord Elm|wood, kindly inquiring after his health, and &s;aying he &s;hould be down early in the following week.&mdash;Never were the friendly expre&s;&s;ions of his lord&s;hip half &s;o welcome to him; for they &s;erved to &s;ooth

<HEAD>CHAPTER XIII.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN Sandford acted deliberately, he al|ways acted up to his duty; it was his duty to for|give Ru&s;hbrook, and he did &s;o&mdash;but he had de|clared he would never "be again in his company, unle&s;s Lord Elmwood was pre&s;ent;"&mdash;and with all his forgivene&s;s, he found an unforgiving gratifica|tion, in the duty, of being obliged to keep his word.</P>
<P>The next day Ru&s;hbrook dined alone, while Sand|ford gave his company to the ladies&mdash;Ru&s;hbrook was too proud to &s;eek to reconcile Sandford with abject conce&s;&s;ions, but he endeavoured to meet him as by accident, and try what, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, a &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ive apology might effect.&mdash;For a day or two, all the &s;chemes he formed on that head proved fruit|le&s;s; he could never procure even a &s;ight of him.&mdash;But on the evening of the third day, taking a lonely walk, he turned the corner of a grove, and &s;aw in the very path he was going, Sandford, ac|companied by Mi&s;s Woodley; and, what agitated him much more, Lady Matilda was with them.&mdash;He knew not whether to proceed, or to quit the path and palpably &s;hun them. To one who &s;eemed to put an unkind con&s;truction upon all he &s;aid and did, he knew to do either, would be to do wrong.&mdash;In &s;pite of the propen&s;ity he felt to pa&s;s &s;o near to Lady Matilda, could he have known what con|duct would have been deemed the mo&s;t re&s;pectful, whatever painful denial it had co&s;t him, that, he would have adopted.&mdash;But undetermined whether
<PB N="283" REF="025650_0285_0FCEB2D0B9820BC0">
to go forward, or cro&s;s to another path, he &s;till walked on till he came too nigh to recede; he then, with a diffidence not affected, but felt in the mo&s;t powerful degree, pulled off his hat; and without bowing, &s;tood &s;ilently while the company pa&s;&s;ed.&mdash;Sandford walked on &s;ome paces before, and took no farther notice as he went by him, than ju&s;t touching the fore part of his hat with his finger.&mdash;Mi&s;s Woodley curt&s;ied as &s;he followed.&mdash;But Lady Matilda made a full &s;top, and &s;aid, in the gentle&s;t accents, "I hope, Mr. Ru&s;hbrook, you are per|fectly recovered."</P>
<P>It was the &s;weete&s;t mu&s;ic he ever li&s;tened to; and he returned with the mo&s;t re&s;pectful bow, "I am better a great deal, Ma'am," and pur&s;ued his way as if he did not dare to utter another &s;yllable.</P>
<P>Sandford &s;eldom found fault with Lady Matilda; not becau&s;e he loved her, but becau&s;e &s;he &s;eldom did wrong&mdash;upon this occa&s;ion, however, he was half inclined to reprimand her; but yet he did not know what to &s;ay&mdash;the &s;ub&s;equent humility of Ru&s;hbrook had taken from the indi&s;cretion of her &s;peaking to him, and the event could by no means ju&s;tify his cen&s;ure.&mdash;On hearing her begin to &s;peak, Sandford had &s;topped; and as Ru&s;hbrook after re|plying, walked away, Sandford called to her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, "Come, come along." But at the &s;ame time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> out his elbow for her to take hold of his arm.</P>
<P>She ha&s;tened her &s;teps, and did &s;o&mdash;then turning to Mi&s;s Woodley, &s;he &s;aid, "I expected you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;poken to Mr. Ru&s;hbrook; it might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|vented me."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley replied, "I was at a lo&s;s what to do; when we met formerly, he always &s;poke fir&s;t."</P>
<P>"And ought now," cried Sandford angrily&mdash;and then added, with a &s;arca&s;tic &s;mile, "It is certainly the duty of the &s;uperior, to be the fir&s;t who &s;peaks."</P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="025650_0286_0FCEB30CC5706520">
"He did not look as if he thought him&s;elf our &s;uperior," replied Matilda.</P>
<P>"No," returned Sandford, "&s;ome people can put on what looks they plea&s;e."</P>
<P>"Then while he looks &s;o pale," replied Matilda, "and &s;o dejected, I can never forbear &s;peaking to him when we meet, whatever he may think of it."</P>
<P>"And were he and I to meet a hundred, nay a thou&s;and times," replied Sandford, "I don't think I &s;hall ever &s;peak to him again."</P>
<P>"Ble&s;s me! what for, Mr. Sandford?" cried Matilda&mdash;for Sandford, who was not a man that repeated little incidents, had never mentioned the circum&s;tance of their quarrel.</P>
<P>"I have taken &s;uch a re&s;olution,"&mdash;an&s;wered he, "yet I bear him no enmity."</P>
<P>As this &s;hort reply indicated he meant to &s;ay no more, no more was a&s;ked; and the &s;ubject dropped.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Ru&s;hbrook, happier than he had been for months; intoxicated with joy at that voluntary mark of civility he had received from Lady Matilda, felt his heart &s;o joyous, &s;o free from every particle of malice, that he re&s;olved in the humble&s;t manner, to make atonement for the breach of decorum he had lately been guilty of to Mr. Sandford."</P>
<P>Too happy at this time to &s;uffer a mortification from any treatment he might receive, he &s;ent his &s;ervant to him into his &s;tudy, as &s;oon as he was re|turned home, to beg to know, "If he might be permitted to wait upon him, with a me&s;&s;age he had to deliver from Lord Elmwood."</P>
<P>The &s;ervant returned&mdash;"Mr. Sandford de&s;ired he would &s;end the me&s;&s;age by him, or the hou&s;e &s;teward." This was highly affronting; but Ru&s;h|brook was not in a humour to be offended, and he &s;ent again, begging he would admit him;&mdash;but the an&s;wer was, "he was bu&s;y."</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="025650_0287_0FCEB2D2340D5910">
Thus, defeated in his hopes of reconciliation, his new tran&s;ports felt an allay, and the few days that remained before Lord Elmwood came, he pa&s;&s;ed in &s;olitary mu&s;ing, and ineffectual walks and looks to|wards that path where he had met Matilda&mdash;&s;he came that way no more&mdash;nor indeed &s;carce quitted her apartment, in the practi&s;e of that confinement &s;he had to experience on the arrival of her father.</P>
<P>All her former agitations now returned. On the day he arrived &s;he wept&mdash;all the night &s;he did not &s;leep&mdash;and the name of Ru&s;hbrook again be|came hateful to her.&mdash;His lord&s;hip came in extreme good health and &s;pirits, but appeared concerned to find Ru&s;hbrook le&s;s well than when he went from town.&mdash;Sandford was now under the nece&s;&s;ity of being in Ru&s;hbrook's company, yet he took care never to &s;peak to him but when he was obliged; or to look at him but when he could not help it.&mdash;Lord Elmwood ob&s;erved this conduct, yet he neither wondered, or was offended at it&mdash;he had always perceived what little e&s;teem Sandford had &s;howed his nephew from his fir&s;t return; but he forgave in Sandford's humour a thou&s;and faults he would for|give in no other; nor did he deem this one of his greate&s;t faults, knowing the claim to his partiality from another object.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley waited on Lord Elmwood as for|merly; dined with him, and as heretofore related to the attentive Matilda all that pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>About this time Lord Margrave, deprived by the &s;ea&s;on of all the &s;ports of the field, felt his love for Matilda (which had been extreme while divided with the love of hunting) too violent to be &s;ubdued; and he re&s;olved, though reluctantly, to apply to her father for his con&s;ent to their union;&mdash;but writing to Sandford this re&s;olution, he was once more re|pul&s;ed, and charged as a man of honour, to for|bear to di&s;turb the tranquillity of the family, by
<PB N="286" REF="025650_0288_0FCEB30FEDEB5730">
any application of the kind.&mdash;To this Sandford re|ceived no an&s;wer; for his lord&s;hip, highly incen&s;ed at his mi&s;tre&s;s's repugnance to him, determined more firmly than ever, to con&s;ult his own happine&s;s alone; and as that depended merely upon his ob|taining her, he cared not by what method it was effected.</P>
<P>About a fortnight after Lord Elmwood came into the country, as he was riding one morning, his hor&s;e fell with him, and cru&s;hed his leg in &s;o unfortunate a manner, as to be pronounced of dangerous con|&s;equence.&mdash;He was brought home in a po&s;t chai&s;e, and Matilda heard of the accident with more grief than would, on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, appertain to the mo&s;t fondled child.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the pain he &s;uffered, his fever was one night very high; and Sandford, who &s;el|dom quitted his apartment, went frequently to his bed-&s;ide; every time with the &s;ecret hope he &s;hould hear him a&s;k to &s;ee his daughter&mdash;he was every time di&s;appointed; yet he &s;aw him &s;hake with a cordial friend&s;hip the hand of Ru&s;hbrook, as if he de|lighted in &s;eeing tho&s;e he loved.</P>
<P>The danger in which Lord Elmwood was &s;uppo&s;ed to be, was but of &s;hort duration, and his &s;udden recovery &s;ucceeded.&mdash;Matilda who had wept, moan|ed, and watched during the cri&s;es of his illne&s;s, when &s;he heard he was mending, exclaimed (with a kind of &s;urpri&s;e at the novelty of the &s;en&s;ation) "And this is joy that I feel!&mdash;Oh! I never till now knew, what tho&s;e per&s;ons felt that experienced joy."</P>
<P>Nor did &s;he repine, like Mr. Sandford and Mi&s;s Woodley, at her father's inattention to her during his malady, for &s;he did not hope like them&mdash;&s;he did not hope he would behold her, even in dying.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding his lord&s;hip's &s;eeming indif|ference while his indi&s;po&s;ition continued, no &s;ooner was he recovered &s;o as to receive the congratula|tions
<PB N="287" REF="025650_0289_0FCEB2D5829AA810">
of his friends, than there was no one per&s;on he evidently &s;howed &s;o much &s;atisfaction at &s;eeing, as Mi&s;s Woodley.&mdash;She waited upon him timorou&s;ly, and with more than ordinary di&s;ta&s;te at his late con|duct; when he put out his hand with the utmo&s;t warmth to receive her, drew her to him, &s;aluted her, (an honour he had never in his life conferred before) and all with &s;igns of the &s;incere&s;t friend&s;hip and affection.&mdash;Sandford was pre&s;ent, and ever a&s;|&s;ociating the idea of Matilda with Mi&s;s Woodley, felt his heart bound with a triumph it had not en|joyed for many a day.</P>
<P>Matilda li&s;tened with delight to the recital Mi&s;s Woodley gave on her return, and many times while it la&s;ted, exclaimed, "She was happy." But poor Matilda's &s;udden tran&s;ports of joy, which &s;he termed happine&s;s, were not made for long continuance; and if &s;he ever found cau&s;e for gladne&s;s, &s;he far oftener had motives for grief.</P>
<P>As Mr. Sandford was &s;itting with her and Mi&s;s Woodley one evening about a week after, a per&s;on rung at the bell and inquired for him; on being told of it by the &s;ervant, he went to the door of the apartment and cried, "Oh! is it you? Come in."&mdash;An elderly man entered, who had been for many years the head gardener at Elmwood Hou&s;e; a man of hone&s;ty and &s;obriety, and with a large in|digent family of aged parents, children, and other relatives, who &s;ub&s;i&s;ted wholly on the income ari|&s;ing from his place.&mdash;The ladies, as well as Sand|ford, knew him well, and they all, almo&s;t at once, a&s;ked, "What was the matter?" for his looks told them &s;omething di&s;tre&s;sful had befallen him.</P>
<P>Oh Sir!" &s;aid he to Sandford, "I come to intreat your intere&s;t."</P>
<P>"In what, Edwards?" &s;aid Sandford with a mild voice; for when his a&s;&s;i&s;tance was &s;upplicated in di&s;tre&s;s, his rough tones always took a plaintive key.</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="025650_0290_0FCEB30E3A4EDD58">
"My lord has di&s;charged me from his &s;ervice,"&mdash;(returned Edwards trembling, and the tears &s;tart|ing in his eyes;) "I am undone, Mr. Sandford, unle&s;s you plead for me."</P>
<P>"I will," &s;aid Sandford, "I will."</P>
<P>"And yet I am almo&s;t afraid of your &s;ucce&s;s," replied the man, "for my lord has ordered me out of his hou&s;e this moment; and though I knelt down to him to be heard, he had no pity."</P>
<P>Matilda &s;ighed from the bottom of her heart, and yet &s;he envied this poor man who had been kneeling to her father.</P>
<P>"What was your offence?" cried Sandford.</P>
<P>The man he&s;itated; then looking at Matilda, &s;aid, "I'll tell you, Sir, &s;ome other time."</P>
<P>"Did you name me, before Lord Elmwood?" cried &s;he eagerly, and terrified.</P>
<P>"No, Madam," replied he, "but I unthinkingly &s;poke of my poor lady that is dead and gone."</P>
<P>Matilda bur&s;t into tears.</P>
<P>"How came you to do &s;o mad a thing?" cried Sandford, with the encouragement his looks had once given him, now fled from his face.</P>
<P>"It was unthinkingly," repeated Edwards; "I was &s;howing my lord &s;ome plans for the new walks, and told him, among other things, that her lady|&s;hip had many years ago approved of them."&mdash;'Who?' cried he.&mdash;Still I did not call to mind, but repeated, 'Lady Elmwood, Sir, while you were a|broad.'&mdash;As &s;oon as the&s;e words were delivered, I &s;aw my doom in his looks, and he commanded me to quit his hou&s;e and &s;ervice that in&s;tant."</P>
<P>"I am afraid," &s;aid Sandford, &s;itting down, "I can do nothing for you."</P>
<P>"Yes, Sir, you know you have more power over my lord than any body&mdash;and perhaps you may be able to &s;ave me and all mine from mi&s;ery."</P>
<P>"I would if I could," replied Sandford quickly.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="025650_0291_0FCEB2D6B675CD90">
"You can but try, Sir."</P>
<P>Matilda was all this while drowned in tears; nor was Mi&s;s Woodley much le&s;s affected&mdash;Lady Elm|wood was before their eyes&mdash;Matilda beheld her in her dying moments; Mi&s;s Woodley &s;aw her as the gay ward of Dorriforth.</P>
<P>"A&s;k Mr. Ru&s;hbrook," &s;aid Sandford, "prevail on him to &s;peak; he has more power than I have."</P>
<P>"He has not enough, then," replied Edwards, "for he was in the room with my lord when what I have told you happened."</P>
<P>"And did he &s;ay nothing?" a&s;ked Sandford.</P>
<P>"Yes, Sir; he offered to &s;peak in my behalf, but my lord interrupted him, and ordered him out of the room&mdash;he in&s;tantly went."</P>
<P>Sandford now ob&s;erving the effect which this narration had on the two ladies, led the man to his own apartments, and there a&s;&s;ured him he dur&s;t not undertake his cau&s;e; but that if time or chance &s;hould happily make an alteration in his lord&s;hip's di&s;po&s;ition, he would be the fir&s;t to try to replace him&mdash;Edwards was obliged to &s;ubmit; and before the next day at noon, his plea&s;ant hou&s;e by the &s;ide of the park, his garden, and his orchard, which he had occupied above twenty years, were cleared of their old inhabitant, and all his wretched family.</P>

<P>THIS melancholy incident perhaps affected Matilda and all the friends of the decea&s;ed Lady Elmwood, beyond any other that had occurred &s;ince her death. A few days after this circum&s;tance, Mi&s;s Woodley, in order to divert the di&s;con&s;olate

mind of Lady Matilda, (and perhaps bring her &s;ome little anecdotes, to con&s;ole her for that which had given her &s;o much pain) waited upon Lord Elmwood in his library, and borrowed &s;ome books out of it.&mdash;He was now perfectly well from his fall, and re|ceived her with the &s;ame politene&s;s as u&s;ual, but, of cour&s;e, not with that particular warmth he had received her ju&s;t after his illne&s;s.&mdash;Ru&s;hbrook was in the library at the &s;ame time; he &s;howed to her &s;everal beautiful prints, which his lord&s;hip had ju&s;t re|ceived from London, and appeared anxious to enter|tain, and give tokens of his e&s;teem and re&s;pect for her. But what gave her plea&s;ure beyond any other at|tention was, that after &s;he had taken (by the aid of Ru&s;hbrook) about a dozen volumes from different &s;helves, and had laid them together, &s;aying &s;he would &s;end her &s;ervant to fetch them, Lord Elm|wood went eagerly to the place where they were, and taking up each book, examined attentively what it was.&mdash;One author he complained was too light, another too depre&s;&s;ing, and put them on the &s;helves again; another was erroneous, and he changed it for a better; and thus he warned her again&s;t &s;ome, and &s;elected other authors; as the mo&s;t cautious preceptor culls for his pupil, or a fond father for his darling child.&mdash;She thanked him for his attention to her, but her heart thanked him for his attention to his daughter.&mdash;For as &s;he her&s;elf never received &s;uch a proof of his care &s;ince all their long acquaintance, &s;he rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;ed Matilda's reading, and not hers, was the object of his &s;olici|tude.</P>
<P>Having in the&s;e books &s;tore of comfort for poor Matilda, &s;he eagerly returned with them; and in reciting every particular circum&s;tance, made her con&s;ider the volumes almo&s;t like pre&s;ents from her father.</P>
<P>The month of September was now arrived, and
<PB N="291" REF="025650_0293_0FCEB2D855242F88">
Lord Elmwood, accompanied by Ru&s;hbrook, went to a &s;mall &s;hooting &s;eat about twenty miles di&s;tant from Elmwood Ca&s;tle, for a week's particular &s;port.&mdash;Matilda was once more at large; and one beau|tiful forenoon, about eleven o'clock, &s;eeing Mi&s;s Woodley walking on the lawn before the hou&s;e, &s;he ha&s;tily took her hat to join her; and not waiting to put it on, went nimbly down the great &s;tair-ca&s;e with it hanging on her arm.&mdash;When &s;he had de|&s;cended a few &s;tairs, &s;he heard a foot&s;tep walking &s;lowly up; and (from what emotion &s;he could not tell,) &s;he &s;topt &s;hort, half re&s;olved to return back.&mdash;She he&s;itated a &s;ingle in&s;tant which to do&mdash;then went a few &s;teps farther till &s;he came to the &s;econd landing place; when, by the &s;udden winding of the &s;tair-ca&s;e,&mdash;Lord Elmwood was immediately be|fore her!</P>
<P>She had felt &s;omething like affright before &s;he &s;aw him&mdash;but her rea&s;on told her &s;he had nothing to fear, as he was far away.&mdash;But now the appear|ance of a &s;tranger whom &s;he had never before &s;een; an air of authority in his looks as well as in the &s;ound of his &s;teps; a re&s;emblance to the portrait &s;he had &s;een of him; a &s;tart of a&s;toni&s;hment which he gave on beholding her; but above all&mdash;her <HI>fears</HI> con|firmed her it was him.&mdash;She gave a &s;cream of ter|ror&mdash;put out her trembling hands to catch the ba|lu&s;trades on the &s;tairs for &s;upport&mdash;mi&s;&s;ed them&mdash;and fell motionle&s;s into her father's arms.</P>
<P>He caught her, as by that impul&s;e he would have caught any other per&s;on falling for want of aid.&mdash;Yet when he found her in his arms, he &s;till held her there&mdash;gazed on her attentively&mdash;and once pre&s;&s;ed her to his bo&s;om.</P>
<P>At length, trying to e&s;cape the &s;nare into which he had been led, he was going to leave her on the &s;pot where &s;he fell, when her eyes opened, and &s;he
<PB N="292" REF="025650_0294_0FCEB31441ECA918">
uttered, "Save me!"&mdash;Her voice unmanned him.&mdash;His long-re&s;trained tears now bur&s;t forth&mdash;and &s;eeing her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lap&s;ing into a &s;woon again, he cried out eagerly to recall her.&mdash;Her name did not however come to his recollection&mdash;nor any name but this&mdash;"Mi&s;s Milner&mdash;dear Mi&s;s Milner."</P>
<P>That &s;ound did not awake her; and now again he wi&s;hed to leave her in this &s;en&s;ele&s;s &s;tate, that not remembering what had pa&s;&s;ed, &s;he might e&s;cape the puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>But at this in&s;tant Giffard, with another &s;ervant, pa&s;&s;ed by the foot of the &s;tairs; on which, Lord Elmwood called to them&mdash;and into Giffard's hands delivered his apparently dead child; without one command re&s;pecting her, or one word of any kind; while his face was agitated with &s;hame, with pity, with anger; with paternal tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>As Giffard &s;tood trembling, while he relieved his lord from this haple&s;s burthen; his lord&s;hip had to unloo&s;e her hand from the &s;ide of his coat, which &s;he had caught fa&s;t hold of as &s;he fell, and gra&s;ped &s;o clo&s;ely, it was with difficulty relea&s;ed.&mdash;On tak|ing the hand away his lord&s;hip trembled&mdash;faltered&mdash;then bade Giffard do it.</P>
<P>"Who, I, my lord, I &s;eparate you?" cried he.&mdash;But recollecting him&s;elf, "My lord, I will obey your commands, whatever they are." And &s;eizing her hand, pulled it with violence&mdash;it fell&mdash;and her father went away.</P>
<P>Matilda was carried to her own apartments, laid upon the bed, and Mi&s;s Woodley called to attend her, after li&s;tening to the recital of what had pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>When Lady Elmwood's old and affectionate friend entered the room, and &s;aw her youthful charge lying pale and &s;peechle&s;s, yet no father by to comfort or &s;ooth her, &s;he lifted up her hands to heaven, ex|claiming, with a flood of tears, "And is this the end of thee, my poor child?&mdash;Is this the end of all
<PB N="293" REF="025650_0295_0FCEB2DC88BE9238">
our hopes&mdash;of thy own fearful hopes&mdash;and of thy mother's &s;upplications?&mdash;Oh! Lord Elmwood! Lord Elmwood!"</P>
<P>At that name Matilda &s;tarted, and cried, "Where is he?&mdash;Is it a dream, or have I &s;een him?"</P>
<P>"It is all a dream, my dear," &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley.</P>
<P>"And yet I thought he held me in his arms," &s;he replied, "I thought I felt his hands pre&s;s mine&mdash;Let me &s;leep and dream it again."</P>
<P>Now thinking it be&s;t to undeceive her, "It is no dream, my dear," returned Mi&s;s Woodley.</P>
<P>"Is it not?" cried &s;he, &s;tarting up and leaning on her elbow&mdash;"Then I &s;uppo&s;e I mu&s;t go away&mdash;go for ever away."&mdash;</P>
<P>Sandford now entered.&mdash;Having been told the news, he came to condole.&mdash;But at the &s;ight of him Matilda was terrified, and cried, "Do not reproach me, do not upbraid me&mdash;I know I have done wrong&mdash;I know I had but one command from my father, and that I have di&s;obeyed."</P>
<P>Sandford could not reproach her, for he could not &s;peak;&mdash;he therefore only walked to the win|dow, and concealed his tears.</P>
<P>That whole day and night was pa&s;&s;ed in &s;ympa|thetic grief, in alarm at every &s;ound, le&s;t it &s;hould be a me&s;&s;enger to pronounce Matilda's de&s;tiny.</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood did not &s;tay upon this vi&s;it above three hours at Elmwood Hou&s;e; he then &s;et off a|gain for the &s;eat he had left; where Ru&s;hbrook &s;till remained, and from whence his lord&s;hip had merely come by accident, to look over &s;ome wri|tings he wanted di&s;patched to town.</P>
<P>During his &s;hort continuance here, Sandford cautiou&s;ly avoided his pre&s;ence; for he thought, in a ca&s;e like this, what nature would not of her&s;elf do, no art, no arguments of his could effect&mdash;and to nature and to providence he left the whole&mdash;What the&s;e two powerful principles brought about,

<HEAD>A Letter from Giffard, Lord Elmwood's Hou&s;e Steward, to Mi&s;s Woodley.</HEAD>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY Lord, above a twelvemonth ago, ac|quainted me he had permitted his daughter to re&s;ide in his hou&s;e; but at the &s;ame time he in|formed me, the grant was under a certain re|&s;triction, which if ever broken, I was to &s;ee his then determination (of which he al&s;o acquainted me) put in execution. In con&s;equence of Lady Matilda's indi&s;po&s;ition, Madam, I have ventured to delay this notice till morning.&mdash;I need not &s;ay with what concern I now give it, or mention to you, I believe, what is forfeited. My lord &s;taid but a few hours ye&s;terday after the unhappy cir|cum&s;tance on which I write, took place; nor did I &s;ee him after, till he was in his carriage; he then &s;ent for me to the carriage door, and he told me he &s;hould be back in two days time, and added, 'Remember your duty.' That duty, I hope, Madam, you will not require I &s;hould mention in more direct terms. As &s;oon as my lord returns, I have no doubt but he will a&s;k me if it is fulfilled, and I &s;hall be under the greate&s;t apprehen&s;ion &s;hould his commands not be obeyed.</P>
<P>If there is any thing wanting for the conveni|ence of your and Lady Matilda's departure, you have but to order it, and it is at your &s;ervice&mdash;I

mean likewi&s;e any ca&s;h you may have occa&s;ion for. I &s;hould pre&s;ume to add my opinion where you might be&s;t take up your abode; but with &s;uch advice as you will have from Mr. Sandford, mine would be but a&s;&s;uming.</P>
<P>I would al&s;o have waited upon you, Madam, and have delivered my&s;elf the &s;ub&s;tance of this letter; but I am an old man, and the changes I have been witne&s;s to in my lord's hou&s;e &s;ince I fir&s;t lived in it, has increa&s;ed my age many years; and I have not the &s;trength to &s;ee you upon this occa&s;ion.&mdash;I loved my decea&s;ed lady&mdash;I love my lord&mdash;and I love their child&mdash;nay, &s;o I am &s;ure does my lord him&s;elf; but there is no accounting for his re&s;olutions, or for the alteration his di&s;|po&s;ition has lately undergone.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>When this letter was brought to Mi&s;s Woodley, &s;he knew what it contained before &s;he opened it, and therefore took it with an air of re&s;ignation&mdash;yet though &s;he gue&s;&s;ed the momentous part of its contents, &s;he dreaded in what words it might be re|lated; and having now no great good to hope for, hope, that will never totally expire, clung at this cri&s;is to little circum&s;tances, and &s;he hoped mo&s;t fer|vently the terms of the letter might not be har&s;h, but that Lord Elmwood had delivered his com|mands in gentle language. The event proved he had; and lo&s;t to every important comfort, &s;he felt grateful to him for this &s;mall one.</P>
<P>Matilda, too, was cheered by this letter, becau&s;e &s;he expected &s;omething wor&s;e; and the la&s;t line
<PB N="296" REF="025650_0298_0FCEB373807CEC78">
where Giffard &s;aid he knew "his lord&s;hip loved her," &s;he thought repaid her for the purport of the other part.</P>
<P>Sandford was not &s;o ea&s;ily re&s;igned or comforted&mdash;he walked about the room when the letter was &s;hown to him&mdash;called it cruel&mdash;&s;tifled his tears, and wi&s;hed to &s;how his re&s;entment only&mdash;but the former bur&s;t through all his endeavours, and he &s;unk into grief.</P>
<P>Nor was the fortitude of Matilda, which came to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance on the fir&s;t on&s;et of this trial, &s;ufficient to arm her, when the moment came &s;he was to quit the hou&s;e&mdash;her father's hou&s;e&mdash;never to &s;ee that, or him again.</P>
<P>When word was brought that the carriage was at the door, which was to convey her from all &s;he held &s;o dear, and &s;he &s;aw before her the pro&s;pect of a long, youthful and healthful life, in which mi&s;ery and de&s;pair were all &s;he could di&s;cern; that de&s;pair &s;eized her at once, and gaining courage from it, &s;he cried,</P>
<P>"What have I to fear if I di&s;obey my father's commands once more? he cannot u&s;e me wor&s;e. I'll &s;tay here till he returns&mdash;again throw my&s;elf in his way, and then I will not faint, but plead for mercy. Perhaps were I to kneel to him&mdash;kneel, like other children, and beg his ble&s;&s;ing; he would not refu&s;e it me."</P>
<P>"You mu&s;t not try," &s;aid Sandford mildly.</P>
<P>"Who?" cried &s;he, "&s;hall prevent my flying to my father? have I another friend on earth to go to? have I one relation in the world but him? This is the &s;econd time I have been commanded out of the hou&s;e. In my infant &s;tate my cruel father turned me out; but then he &s;ent me to a mother&mdash;now I have none; and I will &s;tay with him."</P>
<P>Again the &s;teward &s;ent to let them know the coach was waiting.</P>
<P><PB N="297" REF="025650_0299_0FCEB3402BF49428">
Sandford now, with a determined countenance, went coolly up to Lady Matilda, and taking her hand, &s;eemed re&s;olved to lead her to the carriage.</P>
<P>Accu&s;tomed to be awed by every &s;erious look of his, &s;he yet re&s;i&s;ted this; and cried, "Would <HI>you</HI> be the mini&s;ter of my father's cruelty?"</P>
<P>"Then," &s;aid Sandford &s;olemnly to her, "fare|well&mdash;from this moment you and I part. I will take my leave, and do you remain where you are&mdash;at lea&s;t till you are forced away. But I'll not &s;tay to be turned out&mdash;for it is impo&s;&s;ible your father will &s;uffer any friend of yours to continue here, af|ter this di&s;obedience. Adieu."</P>
<P>"I'll go this moment," &s;aid &s;he, and ro&s;e ha&s;tily.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley took her at her word, and hurried her immediately out of the room.</P>
<P>Sandford followed &s;low behind, with the &s;ame &s;pirits as if he had followed at her funeral.</P>
<P>When &s;he came to that &s;pot on the &s;tairs, where &s;he had met her father, &s;he &s;tarted back; and &s;carcely knew how to pa&s;s it. When &s;he had&mdash;"There he held me," &s;aid &s;he, "and I thought I felt him pre&s;s me to his heart, but I now find I was mi&s;taken."</P>
<P>As Sandford came forward to hand her into the coach, "Now you behave well;" &s;aid he, "by this behaviour, you do not entirely clo&s;e all pro&s;pect of reconciliation with your father."</P>
<P>"Do you think it is not yet impo&s;&s;ible?" cried &s;he, cla&s;ping his hand. "Giffard &s;ays he loves me," continued &s;he, "and do you think he might yet be brought to forgive me?"</P>
<P>"Forgive you?" cried Sandford.</P>
<P>"Suppo&s;e I was to write to him, and intreat his forgivene&s;s?"</P>
<P>"Do not write yet," &s;aid Sandford with no cheering accent.</P>
<P>The carriage drove off&mdash;and as it went, Matilda
<PB N="298" REF="025650_0300_0FCE9F2E15E6E730">
leaned her head from the window, to &s;urvey Elm|wood Hou&s;e from the roof to the bottom. She ca&s;t her eyes upon the gardens too&mdash;upon the fi&s;h-ponds&mdash;the coach-hou&s;es even, and all the offices ad|joining&mdash;which as objects &s;he &s;hould never &s;ee again&mdash;&s;he gazed at, as objects of importance.</P>

<P>RUSHBROOK, who, at twenty miles di&s;|tance, could have no conjecture what had pa&s;&s;ed at Elmwood Hou&s;e, (during the &s;hort vi&s;it Lord Elm|wood made there) went that way with his dogs and gun, in order to meet his lord&s;hip's chariot on its return, and ride with him back&mdash;he did &s;o&mdash;and getting into the carriage, told my lord eagerly the &s;port he had had during the day; laughed at an ac|cident that had befallen one of his dogs, and for &s;ome time did not perceive but that his lord&s;hip was perfectly attentive. At length, ob&s;erving he an&s;wered more negligently than u&s;ual to what he &s;aid, Ru&s;hbrook turned his eyes quickly upon him and cried,</P>
<P>"My lord, are you not well?"</P>
<P>"Yes; perfectly well, I thank you, Ru&s;hbrook," replied his lord&s;hip, and leaned back again&s;t the carriage.</P>
<P>"I thought, Sir," returned Ru&s;hbrook, "you &s;poke languidly; I beg your pardon."</P>
<P>"I have the head-ach a little," an&s;wered he; then taking off his hat, bru&s;hed the powder from it, and as he put it on again, fetched a mo&s;t heavy &s;igh; which no &s;ooner had e&s;caped him, than, to drown its &s;ound, he &s;aid bri&s;kly,</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="025650_0301_0FCEB3413A66AF00">
"And &s;o you tell me you have had good &s;port to-day?"</P>
<P>"No, my lord, I &s;aid but indifferent."</P>
<P>"True, &s;o you did. Bid the man drive fa&s;ter&mdash;it will be dark before we get home."</P>
<P>"You will &s;hoot to-morrow, my lord?"</P>
<P>"Certainly."</P>
<P>"How does Mr. Sandford do, Sir."</P>
<P>"I did not &s;ee him."</P>
<P>"Not &s;ee Mr. Sandford, my lord?&mdash;but he was out, I &s;uppo&s;e&mdash;for they did not expect you at Elmwood Hou&s;e."</P>
<P>"No, they did not."</P>
<P>In &s;uch conver&s;ation Ru&s;hbrook and his uncle continued till the end of their journey. Dinner was then immediately &s;erved, and his lord&s;hip now appeared much in his u&s;ual &s;pirits; at lea&s;t not &s;u&s;pect|ing any cau&s;e for their abatement, Ru&s;hbrook did not ob&s;erve any alteration.</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood went however earlier to bed than ordinary, or rather to his bed-chamber; for though he retired &s;ome time before his nephew, when Ru&s;h|brook pa&s;&s;ed his chamber-door it was open; and he not in bed, but &s;itting in a mu&s;ing po&s;ture, as if he had forgot to &s;hut it.</P>
<P>When Ru&s;hbrook's valet came to attend his ma&s;|ter, he &s;aid to him,</P>
<P>"I &s;uppo&s;e, Sir, you do not know what has hap|pened at Elmwood Hou&s;e?"</P>
<P>"For heaven's &s;ake, what?" cried Ru&s;hbrook.</P>
<P>"My lord has met Lady Matilda," replied the man.</P>
<P>"How? Where? What's the con&s;equence?"</P>
<P>"We don't know yet, Sir; but all the &s;ervants &s;uppo&s;e, her lady&s;hip will not be &s;uffered to remain there any longer."</P>
<P>"They all &s;uppo&s;e wrong," returned Ru&s;hbrook ha&s;tily; "my lord loves her I am certain, and this
<PB N="300" REF="025650_0302_0FCE9F2F0C1BC310">
event may be the happy means, of his treating her as his child, from this day."</P>
<P>The &s;ervant &s;miled and &s;hook his head.</P>
<P>"Why, what more do you know?"</P>
<P>"Nothing more than I have told you, Sir; ex|cept that his lord&s;hip took no kind of notice of her lady&s;hip, that appeared like love."</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook was all unea&s;ine&s;s and anxiety to know the particulars of what had pa&s;&s;ed; and now Lord Elmwood's inquietude, which he had but &s;lightly noticed before, came full to his ob&s;ervation. He was going to a&s;k more que&s;tions, but he recollected that Lady Matilda's misfortunes were too &s;acred, to be talked of thus familiarly by the &s;ervants of the family; be&s;ides, it was evident this man thought, and but naturally, it might not be for his ma&s;ter's intere&s;t, the father and the daughter &s;hould be united; and therefore would certainly give to all he &s;aid, the oppo&s;ite colouring.</P>
<P>In &s;pite of his prudence, however, and his deli|cacy towards Matilda, Ru&s;hbrook could not let his valet leave him till he had inquired, and learned all the circum&s;tantial account of what had happened; except, indeed, the order received by Giffard;&mdash;which being given after his lord&s;hip was in his car|riage, and in conci&s;e terms, the dome&s;tics who at|tended him (and from whom this man had gained his intelligence) were of that unacquainted.</P>
<P>When the valet had left Ru&s;hbrook alone, the perturbation of his mind was &s;o great, that he was at length undetermined whether to go to bed, or to ru&s;h into his uncle's apartment, and at his feet beg for that compa&s;&s;ion upon his daughter, which he feared he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ad denied her. But then again, to what dangers did he not expo&s;e him&s;elf by &s;uch a &s;tep? Nay, he might perhaps even injure her whom he wi&s;hed to &s;erve; for if his lord&s;hip was at pre|&s;ent unre&s;olved, whether to forgive or to re&s;ent
<PB N="301" REF="025650_0303_0FCEB342B279C4A8">
this di&s;obedience to his commands, another's inter|ference might enrage and determine him on the latter.</P>
<P>This con&s;ideration was &s;o weighty, it re&s;igned Ru&s;hbrook to the &s;u&s;pen&s;e he mu&s;t endure till the morning; when he flattered him&s;elf, that by watch|ing every look and motion of Lord Elmwood's, his penetration would be able to di&s;cover the &s;tate of his heart, and how he meant to act.</P>
<P>But the morning came, and he found all his pry|ing curio&s;ity was of no avail; his lord&s;hip did not u&s;e one word, one look, or action that was not cu&s;|tomary.</P>
<P>On fir&s;t &s;eeing him, Ru&s;hbrook blu&s;hed at the &s;ecret with which he was entru&s;ted; then contem|plated the joy he ought to have known in cla&s;ping in his arms a child like Matilda&mdash;who&s;e tenderne&s;s, reverence, and duty, had deprived her of all &s;en|&s;ation at his &s;ight; which was in Ru&s;hbrook's mind an honour, that rendered him &s;uperior to what he was before.</P>
<P>They were in the fields all the day as u&s;ual; Lord Elmwood now cheerful, and complaining no more of the head-ach.&mdash;Yet once being &s;eparated from his nephew, Ru&s;hbrook cro&s;&s;ed over a &s;tile into a|nother field, and found him &s;itting by the &s;ide of a bank, his gun laying by him, and he lo&s;t in thought. He ro&s;e on &s;eeing him, and proceeded to the &s;port as before.</P>
<P>At dinner, he &s;aid he &s;hould not go to Elmwood Hou&s;e the next day, as he had appointed, but &s;tay where he was three or four days longer.&mdash;From the&s;e two &s;mall occurrences, Ru&s;hbrook would fain have extracted &s;omething by which to judge the &s;tate of his mind; but upon the te&s;t, that was im|po&s;&s;ible&mdash;he had caught him mu&s;ing many a time before; and as to his prolonging his &s;tay, that might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ri&s;e from the &s;port&mdash;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, indeed, had any
<PB N="302" REF="025650_0304_0FCE9F30B0739080">
thing more material &s;wayed him, who could pe|netrate whether it was the effect of the lenity, or the &s;everity, he had dealt towards his child? whe|ther his continuance there was to &s;hun her, or to &s;hun the hou&s;e from whence he had turned her?</P>
<P>The three or four days for their abode where they were, being pa&s;&s;ed, they both returned toge|ther to Elmwood Hou&s;e.&mdash;Ru&s;hbrook thought he &s;aw his uncle's countenance change as they entered the avenue, yet he did not appear le&s;s in &s;pirits; and when Sandford joined them at dinner, his lord&s;hip went with his u&s;ual cheerfulne&s;s to him, (and, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> was his cu&s;tom after any &s;eparation) put out his hand cheerfully to take his. Sandford &s;aid, "How do you do, my lord?" cheerfully in re|turn; but put both his hands into his bo&s;om, and walked to the other &s;ide of the room. Lord Elm|wood did not &s;eem to ob&s;erve this affront&mdash;nor was it done as an affront&mdash;it was merely what poor Sandford felt; and he felt he could <HI>not</HI> &s;hake hands with him.</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook &s;oon learnt the news that Matilda was gone, and Elmwood Hou&s;e was to him a de|&s;ert&mdash;he &s;aw about it no real friend of hers, ex|cept poor Sandford, and to him Ru&s;hbrook knew him&s;elf now, more di&s;plea&s;ing than ever; and all the overtures he made to him to be friends, he at this time found more and more ineffectual. Ma|tilda was bani&s;hed; and her &s;uppo&s;ed triumphant rival was, to Sandford, more odious than he ever had been.</P>
<P>In alleviation of their bani&s;hment, Mi&s;s Wood|ley with her charge had not returned to their old retreat; but were gone to a large farm-hou&s;e, no more than about thirty miles from Lord Elm|wood's: here Sandford with little inconvenience vi&s;ited them; nor did his lord&s;hip ever take any no|tice of his occa&s;ional ab&s;ence; for as he had before
<PB N="303" REF="025650_0305_0FCEB34656D60608">
given his daughter, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to his charge; &s;o honour, delicacy, and the common ties of duty, made him approve, rather than condemn his at|tention to her.</P>
<P>Though Sandford's frequent vi&s;its &s;oothed Ma|tilda, they could not comfort her; for he had no con&s;olation to be&s;tow &s;uited to her mind&mdash;her fa|ther had given no one token of regret for what he had done. He had even inquired &s;ternly of Gif|fard on his returning home,</P>
<P>"If Mi&s;s Woodley had left the hou&s;e?"</P>
<P>The &s;teward gue&s;&s;ing the whole of his meaning, an&s;wered, "Yes, my lord; and <HI>all</HI> your commands in that re&s;pect have been obeyed."</P>
<P>He replied, "I am &s;atisfied," and, to the grief of the old man, appeared really &s;o.</P>
<P>To the farm-hou&s;e, the place of Matilda's re&s;i|dence, there came, be&s;ides Sandford, another vi&s;itor far le&s;s welcome; Vi&s;count Margrave. He had heard with &s;urpri&s;e, and &s;till greater joy, that Lord Elmwood had once more &s;hut his doors again&s;t his daughter. In this her di&s;carded &s;tate, his lord&s;hip no longer burthened his lively imagination with the dull thoughts of marriage, but once more formed the brutal idea of making her his mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Ignorant of a certain deco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters"> which attended all Lord Elmwood's actions, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;u&s;pected his child might be in want; and an acquaintance with the wor&s;t part of her &s;ex informed him, relief from poverty was the &s;ure bargain for his &s;ucce&s;s. With the&s;e hopes, he again paid Mi&s;s Woodley and her a vi&s;it; but the coldne&s;s with which he was &s;till re|ceived by the fir&s;t, and the haughtine&s;s with which the la&s;t &s;till kept him at a di&s;tance, again made him fear to give one allu&s;ion of his purpo&s;e: but he re|turned home re&s;olved to write what he dur&s;t not &s;peak&mdash;he did &s;o&mdash;he offered his &s;ervices, his pur&s;e,

<P>LORD ELMWOOD had now allowed Ru&s;hbrook a long vacation, in re&s;pect to his an&s;wer upon the &s;ubject of marriage; and the young man vainly imagined, his lord&s;hip's intentions upon that &s;ub|ject were entirely given up. One morning however, as he was attending him in the library,</P>
<P>"Henry"&mdash;&s;aid his lord&s;hip, with a pau&s;e at the beginning of his &s;peech, which indicated he was going to &s;ay &s;omething of importance, "Henry&mdash;you have not forgot the di&s;cour&s;e I had with you, a little time previous to your illne&s;s?"</P>
<P>Henry he&s;itated&mdash;for he wi&s;hed to have forgotten it&mdash;but it was too &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed upon his mind. His uncle re&s;umed:</P>
<P>"What, equivocating again, Sir?&mdash;Do you remember it, or do you not?"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Yes, my lord, I do."</P>
<P>"And are you prepared to give me an an&s;wer?" Ru&s;hbrook pau&s;ed again.</P>
<P>"In our former conver&s;ation," his lord&s;hip con|tinued, "I gave you but a week to determine&mdash;there is, I think, elap&s;ed &s;ince that time, half a year."</P>
<P>"About as much, Sir."</P>
<P>"Then &s;urely you have now made up your mind?"</P>
<P>"I had done that at fir&s;t, my lord&mdash;provided it had met with your concurrence."</P>
<P>"You wi&s;hed to lead a batchelor's life, I think you &s;aid."</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="025650_0307_0FCEB34742AB4DC8">
Ru&s;hbrook bowed.</P>
<P>"Contrary to my will?"</P>
<P>"No, my lord, I wi&s;hed to have your approba|tion."</P>
<P>"And you wi&s;hed for my approbation of the very oppo&s;ite thing to that I propo&s;ed? But I am not &s;urpri&s;ed&mdash;&s;uch is the gratitude of the world&mdash;and &s;uch is yours."</P>
<P>"My lord, if you doubt my gratitude"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Give me a proof of it Harry, and I will doubt of it no longer?"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Upon every other &s;ubject but this, my lord, heaven is my witne&s;s your happine&s;s"&mdash;</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip interrupted him. "I under&s;tand you&mdash;upon every other &s;ubject, but the only one, my content requires, you are ready to obey me. I thank you."</P>
<P>"My lord, do not torture me with this &s;u&s;picions it is &s;o contrary to my de&s;erts, I cannot bear it."</P>
<P>"Su&s;picion of your ingratitude!&mdash;you judge too favourably of my opinion;&mdash;it amounts to cer|tainty."</P>
<P>"Then, to convince you, Sir, I am not ungrate|ful, tell me who the lady is you have cho&s;en for me, and here I give you my word, I will &s;acrifice all my future pro&s;pects of happine&s;s&mdash;all, for which I would wi&s;h to live&mdash;and become her hu&s;|band, as &s;oon as &s;oon as you &s;hall appoint."</P>
<P>This was &s;poken with a tone &s;o impre&s;&s;ive of de&s;|pair, that Lord Elmwood replied,</P>
<P>"And while you obey me, you take care to let me know, it will co&s;t you your future happine&s;s.&mdash;This is, I &s;uppo&s;e, to enhance the merit of the obligation&mdash;but I &s;hall not accept your acquie&s;ce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e on the&s;e terms."</P>
<P>"Then in di&s;pen&s;ing with it, I hope <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, for your pardon?"</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="025650_0308_0FCEB318EF7667E8">
"Do you &s;uppo&s;e, Ru&s;hbrook, I can pardon an offence, the &s;ole foundation of which, ari&s;es from a &s;pirit o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> di&s;obedience? for you have declared to me your affections are di&s;engaged. In our la&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> did you not &s;ay &s;o?"</P>
<P>"At fir&s;t I did, my lord&mdash;but you permitted me to con&s;ult my heart more clo&s;ely; and I have found I was mi&s;taken."</P>
<P>"You then own you at fir&s;t told me a fal&s;ehood, and yet have all this time, kept me in &s;u&s;pen&s;e without confe&s;&s;ing it?"</P>
<P>"I waited, Sir, till you &s;hould inquire"&mdash;</P>
<P>"You have then, Sir, waited too long." And the fire <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">a&s;hed from his eyes.</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook now found him&s;elf in that perilous &s;tate, that admitted of no medium of re&s;entment, but by &s;uch da&s;tardly conduct on his part, as would wound both his truth and courage; and thus ani|mated by his danger, he was re&s;olved to plunge boldly at once into the depth of his patron's anger.</P>
<P>"My lord," &s;aid he, (but he did not undertake this ta&s;k without &s;u&s;taining the trembling and con|vul&s;ion of his whole frame) "My lord&mdash;waving for a moment the &s;ubject of my marriage&mdash;permit me to remind you, that when I was upon my &s;ick bed, you promi&s;ed, that on my recovery, you would li&s;ten to a petition I had to offer you."</P>
<P>"Let me recollect,"&mdash;&s;aid his lord&s;hip. "Yes&mdash;I remember &s;omething of it. But I &s;aid nothing to warrant any improper petition."</P>
<P>"Its impropriety was not named, my lord."</P>
<P>"No matter&mdash;that, you your&s;elf mu&s;t judge of, and an&s;wer for the con&s;equences."</P>
<P>"I would an&s;wer with my life, willingly&mdash;but I own I &s;hrink from your anger."</P>
<P>"Then do not provoke it."</P>
<P>"I have already gone too far to recede&mdash;and you would of cour&s;e demand an explanation, if I at|tempted to &s;top here."</P>
<P><PB N="307" REF="025650_0309_0FCEB348B395A488">
"I &s;hould."</P>
<P>"Then, my lord, I am bound to &s;peak&mdash;but do not interrupt me&mdash;hear me out, before you bani&s;h me from your &s;ight for ever."</P>
<P>"I will, Sir," replied his lord&s;hip, prepared to hear &s;omething that would di&s;plea&s;e him, and yet determined to hear with patience to the conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>"Then, my lord"&mdash;(cried Ru&s;hbrook, in the greate&s;t agitation both of mind and body) "Your daughter"&mdash;</P>
<P>The re&s;olution his lord&s;hip had taken (and on which he had given his word to his nephew not to interrupt him) immediately gave way.&mdash;The colour ro&s;e in his face&mdash;his eyes darted lightning&mdash;and his hand was lifted up with the emotion, that word had created.</P>
<P>"You promi&s;ed to hear me, my lord?" cried Ru&s;hbrook, "and I claim your promi&s;e."</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip now &s;uddenly overcame his violence of pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;tood &s;ilent and re&s;igned to hear him; but with a determined look, expre&s;&s;ive of the vengeance that &s;hould en&s;ue.</P>
<P>"Lady Matilda," re&s;umed Ru&s;hbrook, "is an object that wre&s;ts from me the enjoyment of every ble&s;&s;ing your kindne&s;s be&s;tows. I cannot but feel my&s;elf as her adver&s;ary&mdash;as one who has &s;upplanted her in your affections&mdash;who &s;upplies her place, while &s;he is exiled, a wanderer, and an orphan."</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip took off his eyes from Ru&s;hbrook, during this la&s;t &s;entence, and ca&s;t them on the floor.</P>
<P>"If I feel gratitude towards you, my lord," con|tinued he, "gratitude is innate in my heart, and I mu&s;t al&s;o feel it towards her, who fir&s;t introduced me to your protection."</P>
<P>Again the colour flew to Lord Elmwood's face; and again he could hardly re&s;train him&s;elf from ut|tering his indignation.</P>
<P>"It was the mother of Lady Matilda;" con|tinued
<PB N="308" REF="025650_0310_0FCEB31A349136E0">
Ru&s;hbrook, "who was this friend to me; nor will I ever think of marriage, or any other joy|ful pro&s;pect, while you abandon the only child of my beloved patrone&s;s, and load me with the rights, which belong to her."</P>
<P>Here Ru&s;hbrook &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">pped&mdash;and Lord Elmwood was &s;ilent too, for near half a minute; but &s;till his countenance continued fixed, with his unvaried re|&s;olves.</P>
<P>After this long pau&s;e, his lord&s;hip &s;aid com|po&s;edly, but firmly, "Have you fini&s;hed, Mr. Ru&s;h|brook?"</P>
<P>"All that I dare to utter, my lord, and I fear, already too much."</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook now trembled more than ever, and looked pale as death; for the ardour of &s;peaking being over, he waited his &s;entence, with le&s;s con|&s;tancy of mind than he expected he &s;hould.</P>
<P>"You di&s;approve my conduct, it &s;eems?" &s;aid Lord Elmwood, "and in that, you are but like the re&s;t of the world&mdash;and yet, among all my acquaint|ance, you are the only one who has dared to in&s;ult me with your opinion. And this you have not done inadvertently; moreover knowingly, willingly, and deliberately. But as it has been my fate to be u&s;ed ill, and &s;evered from all tho&s;e per&s;ons to whom my &s;oul has been mo&s;t attached; with le&s;s regret I can part from you, than was this my fir&s;t trial."</P>
<P>There was a truth and a pathetic <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound in the ut|terance of the&s;e words, that &s;truck Ru&s;hbrook to the heart&mdash;and he beheld him&s;elf as a barbarian, who had treated his benevolent and only friend, with an in&s;ufferable liberty; void of re&s;pect for tho&s;e gnawing &s;orrows which had imbittered &s;o many years of his life, and in open violation of his mo&s;t &s;trict commands. He felt he de&s;erved all he was going to &s;uffer, and he fell upon his knees, not

&s;o much to deprecate the doom he &s;aw impending, as thus humbly to acknowledge it was his due.</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood, irritated by this po&s;ture, as a &s;ign of the pre&s;umptuous hopes he might be for|given, &s;uffered now his anger to break through all bounds; and rai&s;ing his voice, he cried in a rage,</P>
<P>"Leave my hou&s;e, Sir, Leave my hou&s;e in&s;tantly, and &s;eek &s;ome other home."</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as the&s;e words were begun, Sandford opened the library door; was witne&s;s to them, and to the imploring &s;ituation of Ru&s;hbrook. He &s;tood &s;ilent with amaze!</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook aro&s;e, and feeling in his mind a pre|&s;age, that he might never from that hour, behold his benefactor more; as he bowed to him in token of obedience to his commands, a &s;hower of tears covered his face; but Lord Elmwood, unmoved, fixed his eyes upon him, which pur&s;ued him with their enraged looks to the end of the room. Here he had to pa&s;s Sandford; who, for the fir&s;t time in his life, took hold of him by the hand, and &s;aid to Lord Elmwood, "My lord, what's the mat|ter?"</P>
<P>"That ungrateful villain," cried his lord&s;hip, "has dared to in&s;ult me. Leave my hou&s;e this moment, Sir."</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook made an effort to go, but Sandford &s;till held his hand; and &s;aid to Lord Elmwood,</P>
<P>"He is but a boy, my lord, and do not give him the puni&s;hment of a man."</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook now &s;natched his hand from Sand|ford's, and threw it with him&s;elf upon his neck; where he indeed &s;obbed like a boy.</P>
<P>"You are both in league," exclaimed Lord Elm|wood.</P>
<P>"Do you &s;u&s;pect me of partiality to Mr. Ru&s;h|brook?" &s;aid Sandford, advancing nearer to his lord&s;hip.</P>
<P><PB N="310" REF="025650_0312_0FCEB31BF347D2A8">
Ru&s;hbrook had now gained the point of remain|ing in the room; but the hope that privilege in|&s;pired (while he &s;till harboured all the ju&s;t appre|hen&s;ions for his fate) gave <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, perhaps, to a more exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ation of pain, than de&s;pair would have done.

<P>As Sandford approached &s;till nearer to Lord Elm|wood, he continued, "No, my lord, I know you do not &s;u&s;pect me, of partiality to Mr. Ru&s;hbrook&mdash;has any part of my behaviour ever di&s;covered it?"</P>
<P>"You now then," replied his lord&s;hip, "only interfere to provoke me."</P>
<P>"If that were the ca&s;e," returned Sandford, "there have been occa&s;ions, when I might have done it more effectually&mdash;when my own heart-&s;trings were breaking, becau&s;e I would not provoke, or add to what you &s;uffered."</P>
<P>"I am obliged to you, Mr. Sandford," &s;aid his lord&s;hip mildly.</P>
<P>"And if, my lord, I have proved any merit in a late forbearance, reward me for it now; and take this young man from the depth of de&s;pair in which I &s;ee he is &s;unk, and &s;ay you pardon him.</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood made no an&s;wer&mdash;and Ru&s;hbrook drawing &s;trong inferences of hope from his &s;ilence, lifted up his eyes from the ground, and ventured to look in his face; he found it compo&s;ed to what it had been, but &s;till &s;trongly marked with agita|tion.

<P>On which his lord&s;hip &s;aid to him&mdash;"I &s;hall po&s;t|pone your complying with my orders, till you think fit once more to provoke them&mdash;and then, not even Sandford; &s;hall dare to plead your excu&s;e."</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook bowed.</P>
<P>"Go, leave the room, Sir."</P>
<P>He in&s;tantly obeyed.</P>
<P>While Sandford, turning to Lord Elmwood,

<P>"You might indeed think &s;o, did you know how much I have pardoned."</P>
<P>"What was his offence, my lord?"</P>
<P>"Such as I would not have forgiven you, or any other earthly being be&s;ides him&s;elf; but while you were &s;peaking in his behalf, I recollected there was a gratitude &s;o extraordinary in the hazards he ran, that almo&s;t made him pardonable."</P>
<P>"I gue&s;s the &s;ubject then," cried Sandford; "and yet I could not have &s;uppo&s;ed"&mdash;</P>

<P>TO the great relief of Ru&s;hbrook, Lord Elm|wood that day dined from home, and he had not the confu&s;ion to &s;ee him again till the evening.&mdash;previous to this, Sandford and he met at dinner; but as the attendants were pre&s;ent, nothing pa&s;&s;ed on either &s;ide re&s;pecting the incident in the morning. Ru&s;hbrook, from the peril which had &s;o lately threatened him, was now in his perfect, cool, and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate &s;en&s;es; and notwith&s;tanding the real tenderne&s;s which he bore to the daughter of his be|nefactor, he was not in&s;en&s;ible to the comfort of finding him&s;elf, once more in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all tho&s;e enjoyments he had forfeited, and for a mo|ment lo&s;t.</P>
<P>As he reflected on this, to Sandford he felt the
<PB N="312" REF="025650_0314_0FCEB31F0672E4E8">
fir&s;t tie of acknowledgment&mdash;but for his compa&s;|&s;ion, he knew he &s;hould have been at that very time of their meeting at dinner, away from Elmwood Hou&s;e for ever&mdash;and bearing on his mind a &s;till more painful recollection; the burthen of his kind pa|tron's continual di&s;plea&s;ure. Filled with the&s;e thoughts, all the time of dinner he could &s;carce look at his companion, without his eyes &s;wimming in tears of gratitude, and whenever he attempted to &s;peak to him, gratitude choaked his utterance.</P>
<P>Sandford on his part behaved ju&s;t the &s;ame as ever; and to &s;how he did not wi&s;h to remind Ru&s;hbrook of what he had done, he was ju&s;t as uncivil as ever.</P>
<P>Among other things, he &s;aid, "He did not know Lord Elmwood dined from home, for if he had, he &s;hould have dined in his own apartment."</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook was &s;till more obliged to him for all this, and the weight of obligations with which he was oppre&s;&s;ed, made him long for an opportunity to relieve him&s;elf by expre&s;&s;ions. As &s;oon, there|fore, as the &s;ervants were all withdrawn, he began:</P>
<P>"Mr. Sandford, whatever has been your opinion of <HI>me,</HI> I take pride to my&s;elf, that in my &s;entiments towards <HI>you,</HI> I have always di&s;tingui&s;hed you for that humane and di&s;intere&s;ted character, you have this day proved."</P>
<P>"Humane and di&s;intere&s;ted," replied Sandford, "are two flattering epithets for an old man going out of the world, and who can have no temptation to be otherwi&s;e."</P>
<P>"Then &s;uffer me to call your actions generous and compa&s;&s;ionate, for they have &s;aved me"&mdash;</P>
<P>"I know, young man," cried Sandford, inter|rupting him, "you are glad at what I have done, and that you find a gratification in telling me you are; but it is a gratification I will not indulge you with&mdash;therefore &s;ay another &s;entence on the &s;ub|ject, and" (he aro&s;e from his &s;eat) "I'll leave <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="313" REF="025650_0315_0FCEB34F759C9048">
room, and never come into your company again whatever your uncle may &s;ay to it."</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook &s;aw by the &s;olemnity of his counte|nance he was &s;erious, and po&s;itively a&s;&s;ured him he would never thank him more; on which Sandford <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ook his &s;eat again, but he &s;till frowned, and it was many minutes before he conquered his ill humour. As his countenance became le&s;s &s;our, Ru&s;hbrook fell from &s;ome general topics he had eagerly &s;tarted in order to appea&s;e him, and &s;aid,</P>
<P>"How hard is it to re&s;train conver&s;ation from the &s;ubject of our thoughts; and yet amid&s;t our deare&s;t friends, and among per&s;ons who have the &s;ame di&s;po&s;itions and &s;entiments as our own, their minds fixed upon the &s;elf-&s;ame objects, is this con|&s;traint practi&s;ed&mdash;and thus &s;ociety, which was meant for one of our greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings, becomes in&s;ipid, nay, oftentimes more weari&s;ome than &s;olitude."</P>
<P>"I think, young man," replied Sandford, "you have made pretty free with your &s;peech to-day, and ought not to complain of the want of toleration on that &s;core."</P>
<P>"I do complain," replied Ru&s;hbrook; "for if toleration was more frequent, the favour of ob|taining it would be le&s;s."</P>
<P>"And your pride, I &s;uppo&s;e, is above receiving a favour."</P>
<P>"Never from tho&s;e I e&s;teem; and to convince you of it, I wi&s;h this moment to reque&s;t a favour of you."</P>
<P>"I dare &s;ay I &s;hall refu&s;e it. However&mdash;what is it?"</P>
<P>"Permit me to &s;peak to you upon the &s;ubject of Lady Matilda?"</P>
<P>Sandford made no an&s;wer, con&s;equently did not forbid him&mdash;and he proceeded.</P>
<P>"For her &s;ake&mdash;as I &s;uppo&s;e Lord Elmwood may have told you&mdash;I this morning ra&s;hly threw, my&s;elf into the predicament from whence you relea&s;ed me&mdash;for her &s;ake, I have &s;uffered much&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;ake,
<PB N="314" REF="025650_0316_0FCEB32034DD7A50">
I have hazarded a great deal, and am &s;till ready to hazard more."</P>
<P>"But for your own &s;ake, do not," returned Sand|ford drily.</P>
<P>"You may laugh at the&s;e &s;entiments as romantic, Mr. Sandford, but if they are, to me they are ne|verthele&s;s natural."</P>
<P>"But what &s;ervice are they to be, either to her, or to your&s;elf?"</P>
<P>"They are painful to me, and to her would be but impertinent, were &s;he to know them."</P>
<P>"I &s;han't inform her of them, &s;o do not trouble your&s;elf to caution me again&s;t it."</P>
<P>"I was not going&mdash;you know I was not&mdash;but I was going to &s;ay, that from no one &s;o well as from you, could &s;he be told my &s;entiments, without the danger of her re&s;enting the liberty."</P>
<P>"And what impre&s;&s;ion do you wi&s;h to give her, from her becoming acquainted with them?"</P>
<P>"The impre&s;&s;ion, that &s;he has one &s;incere friend&mdash;that upon every occurrence in life, there is a heart &s;o devoted to all &s;he feels, &s;he can never &s;uffer with|out the &s;ympathy of another&mdash;nor ever can com|mand him, and all his fortunes to unite for her wel|fare, without his ready and immediate compliance."</P>
<P>"And do you imagine, that any of your pro|fe&s;&s;ions, or any of her nece&s;&s;ities, would ever pre|vail upon her to put you to the trial?"</P>
<P>"Perhaps not."</P>
<P>"What, then, are the motives which induce you to wi&s;h her to be told of this?"</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook pau&s;ed.</P>
<P>"Do you think," continued Sandford, "the in|telligence will give her any &s;atisfaction?"</P>
<P>"Perhaps not."</P>
<P>"Will it be of any to your&s;elf?"</P>
<P>"The highe&s;t in the world."</P>
<P>"And &s;o all you have been urging upon this oc|ca&s;ion, is, at la&s;t, only to plea&s;e your&s;elf."</P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="025650_0317_0FCEB350FADE2508">
"You wrong my meaning&mdash;it is &s;he&mdash;her merit which in&s;pires my de&s;ire of being known to her&mdash;it is her &s;ufferings, her innocence, her beauty"&mdash;</P>
<P>Sandford &s;tared&mdash;Ru&s;hbrook proceeded: "It is her"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Nay &s;top where you are," cried Sandford; "you are arrived at the zenith of perfection in a woman, and to add one qualification more, would be an anti-climax."</P>
<P>"Oh!" cried Ru&s;hbrook with warmth, "I loved her before ever I beheld-her."</P>
<P>"Loved her!" cried Sandford, with a&s;toni&s;h|ment, "You are talking of what you do not intend."</P>
<P>"I am, indeed," returned he in confu&s;ion, "I fell by accident on the word love."</P>
<P>"And by the &s;ame accident, &s;tumbled on the word beauty; and thus by accident, am I come to the truth of all your profe&s;&s;ions."</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook knew he loved; and though his affec|tion had &s;prung from the mo&s;t laudable motives, yet was he a&s;hamed of it, as of a vice&mdash;he ro&s;e, walked about the room, and did not look Sandford in the face for a quarter of an hour. Sandford, &s;a|tisfied, he had judged rightly, and yet unwilling to be too hard upon a pa&s;&s;ion, which he readily be|lieved mu&s;t have had many noble virtues for its foun|dation, now got up and walked away, without &s;ay|ing any thing in cen&s;ure, though not a word in its approbation.</P>
<P>It was in the month of October, and ju&s;t dark, at the time Ru&s;hbrook was left alone; yet from the a|gitation of his mind, ari&s;ing from the &s;ubject on which he had been talking, he found it impo&s;&s;ible to remain in the hou&s;e, and therefore walked into the fields; but there was another in&s;tigation, more powerful than the nece&s;&s;ity of walking; it was the allurement of pa&s;&s;ing along that path where he had la&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Lady Matilda, and where, for the only
<PB N="316" REF="025650_0318_0FCEB321B70841C0">
time &s;he had conde&s;cended to &s;peak to him dive&s;ted of haughtine&s;s, and with a gentlene&s;s that dwelt upon his memory beyond all her other endowments.</P>
<P>Here he retraced his own &s;teps repeatedly, his whole imagination engro&s;&s;ed with her idea, till the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound of her father's chariot returning home from his vi&s;it, rou&s;ed him from the &s;oft delu&s;ion of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rance, to dread the confu&s;ion and embarra&s;&s;ment he &s;hould endure, on the next meeting with his lord&s;hip. He hoped Sandford might be pre&s;ent, and yet he was now, almo&s;t as much a&s;hamed to be|hold him as his uncle, whom he had &s;o lately of|fended.</P>
<P>As loath to leave the &s;pot where he was, as to enter the hou&s;e, he remained there till he con&s;idered it would be ill manners in his pre&s;ent humiliated &s;ituation, not to &s;how him&s;elf at the u&s;ual &s;upper hour, which was immediately.</P>
<P>As he laid his hand upon the door of the apart|ment to open it, he was &s;orry to hear by Lord Elm|wood's voice, he was in the room before him; for there was &s;omething much more con&s;picuous and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, in entering where he already was, than had his lord&s;hip come in after him. He found him|&s;elf, however rea&s;&s;ured, by overhearing his uncle laugh and &s;peak in a tone expre&s;&s;ive of the utmo&s;t good humour to Sandford, who was with him.</P>
<P>Yet again, he felt all the awkwardne&s;s of his own &s;ituation; but making one courageous effort, opened the door and entered. His lord&s;hip had been away half the day, had dined abroad, and it was nece&s;&s;ary to take &s;ome notice of his return; Ru&s;hbrook there|fore bowed humbly, and what was more to his ad|vantage, he looked humbly. Lord Elmwood made a &s;light return to the &s;alutation, but continued the recital he had begun to Sandford; and then &s;at down to the &s;upper table&mdash;&s;upped&mdash;and pa&s;&s;ed the whole evening without &s;aying a &s;yllable, or even
<PB N="317" REF="025650_0319_0FCEB35487F50490">
ca&s;ting a look in remembrance of what had pa&s;&s;ed in the morning. Or if there was any token, that &s;howed he remembered the circum&s;tance at all, it was the putting his gla&s;s to his nephew's when Ru&s;h|brook called for wine, and drinking at the time he did.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XIX.</HEAD>
<P>THE repul&s;e Lord Margrave received, did not dimini&s;h the ardour of his pur&s;uit; for as he was no longer fearful of re&s;entment from the Earl, what|ever treatment his daughter might receive, he was determined the anger of Lady Matilda, or of her female friend, &s;hould not impede his preten&s;ions.</P>
<P>Having taken this re&s;olution, he laid the plan of an open violation of all right, all power, and to bear away that prize by force, which no art was likely to procure. He concerted with two of his favourite companions, but their advice was, "one &s;truggle more of fair means." This was totally a|gain&s;t his lord&s;hip's will, for he had much rather have encountered the piercing cries of a female in the la&s;t agonies of di&s;tre&s;s, than the fatigue of her &s;entimental harangues, or elegant reproofs, &s;uch as he had the &s;en&s;e to under&s;tand, but not the capa|city to an&s;wer.</P>
<P>Stimulated, however, by his friends to one more trial; in &s;pite of the formal di&s;mi&s;&s;ion he had twice received, he intruded another vi&s;it on Lady Matilda at the farm. Provoked beyond bearing at &s;uch un|feeling a&s;&s;urance, Matilda refu&s;ed to come into the room where he was, and Mi&s;s Woodley alone re|ceived him, and expre&s;&s;ed her &s;urpri&s;e at the little attention he had paid to her explicit de&s;ire.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="025650_0320_0FCEB323322D3ED0">
"Madam," replied the nobleman, "to be plain with you, I am in love."</P>
<P>"I do not the lea&s;t doubt it, my lord," replied Mi&s;s Woodley, "nor ought you to doubt the truth of what I advance, when I a&s;&s;ure you, you have not the &s;malle&s;t rea&s;on to hope your love will be re|turned; for Lady Matilda is re&s;olved <HI>never</HI> to li&s;ten to your pa&s;&s;ion."</P>
<P>"That man," he replied, "is to blame, who can relinqui&s;h his hopes, upon the mere re&s;olution of a lady."</P>
<P>"And that lady would be wrong," replied Mi&s;s Woodley, "who &s;hould entru&s;t her happine&s;s in the care of a man, who can think thus meanly of her, and of her &s;ex."</P>
<P>"I think highly of them all," returned his lord|&s;hip; "and to convince you in how high an e&s;tima|tion I hold her lady&s;hip in particular, my whole fortune is at her command."</P>
<P>"Your ab&s;enting your&s;elf from this hou&s;e, Lord Margrave, &s;he would con&s;ider as a much greater mark of your re&s;pect."</P>
<P>A long conver&s;ation, equally unintere&s;ting as this, en&s;ued; till the unexpected arrival of Mr. Sandford put an end to it. He &s;tarted at the &s;ight of Lord Margrave; but his lord&s;hip was much more affected at the &s;ight of him.</P>
<P>"My lord," &s;aid Sandford boldly to him, "have you received any encouragement from Lady Matilda, to authori&s;e this vi&s;it?"</P>
<P>"None, upon my honour, Mr. Sandford; but I hope you know how to pardon a lover?"</P>
<P>"A rational one I do&mdash;but you, my lord, are not &s;uch, while you per&s;ecute the pretended object of your affection."</P>
<P>"Do you call it per&s;ecution, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> I once offered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a &s;hare of my title and fortune&mdash;and even now, declare my fortune is at her di&s;po&s;al?"</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="025650_0321_0FCEB35585802460">
Sandford was uncertain whether he under&s;tood his meaning&mdash;but his lord&s;hip, provoked at his ill reception, felt a triumph in not detaining him long in doubt, and proceeded thus:</P>
<P>"For the di&s;carded daughter of Lord Elmwood, cannot expect the &s;ame propo&s;als which I made while &s;he was acknowledged, and under the protec|tion of her father."</P>
<P>"What propo&s;als then, my lord?" a&s;ked Sand|ford ha&s;tily.</P>
<P>"Such," replied his lord&s;hip, "as the Duke of Avon made to her mother."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s. Woodley quitted the room that in&s;tant. But Sandford, who never felt re&s;entment but to tho&s;e in whom he &s;aw &s;ome virtue, calmly replied,</P>
<P>"My lord, the Duke of Avon was a gentleman, a man of elegance and breeding; and what have you to offer in recompence for your defects in the&s;e?"</P>
<P>"My wealth," replied he, "oppo&s;ed to her in|digence."</P>
<P>Sandford &s;miled, and an&s;wered,</P>
<P>"Do you &s;uppo&s;e that wealth can be e&s;teemed, which has not been able to make you re&s;pectable? What is it which makes wealth valuable? Is it the plea&s;ures of the table? the plea&s;ures of living in a fine hou&s;e? or riding in a fine coach? The&s;e are plea&s;ures a lord enjoys, but in common with his valet. It is the plea&s;ure of being con&s;picuous, which makes riches de&s;irable&mdash;but if we are con&s;picuous only for our vice and folly, had we not better remain in poverty?"</P>
<P>"You are beneath my notice."</P>
<P>"I tru&s;t I &s;hall continue &s;o&mdash;and that your lord|&s;hip will never again conde&s;cend to come where I am."</P>
<P>"A man of rank conde&s;cends to mix with any &s;ociety, when a pretty woman is his object."</P>
<P>"My lord, I have a book here in my pocket, which I am eager to read; it is an author who &s;peaks
<PB N="320" REF="025650_0322_0FCEB3258EAA1EB0">
&s;en&s;e and rea&s;on&mdash;will you pardon the impatience I feel for &s;uch company; and permit me to call your carriage?"</P>
<P>"Saying this, he went ha&s;tily and called to his lord&s;hip's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ervants; the carriage drove up, the door was opened, and Lord Margrave, a&s;hamed to be expo&s;ed before his attendants, or convinced of the u&s;ele&s;&s;ne&s;s of remaining any longer where he was, departed.</P>
<P>Sandford was &s;oon joined by the ladies; and the conver&s;ation falling<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of cour&s;e, upon the nobleman who had ju&s;t taken his leave, Sandford unwarily ex|claimed, "I wi&s;h Ru&s;hbrook had been here."</P>
<P>"Why?" cried Lady Matilda.</P>
<P>"I do believe," &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley, "that young man has &s;ome good qualities."</P>
<P>"A great many," returned Sandford, mutteringly.</P>
<P>"Happy young man!" cried Matilda: "he is beloved by all tho&s;e, who&s;e affection it would be my choice to po&s;&s;e&s;s, beyond any other ble&s;&s;ing this world could be&s;tow."</P>
<P>"And yet, I que&s;tion, if Ru&s;hbrook is a happy man," &s;aid Sandford.</P>
<P>"He cannot be otherwi&s;e," returned Matilda, "if he is a man of under&s;tanding."</P>
<P>"He does not want for that," replied Sandford; although he has certainly many indi&s;cretions."</P>
<P>"But which Lord Elmwood, I &s;uppo&s;e," &s;aid Matilda, "looks upon with tenderne&s;s."</P>
<P>"Not upon all his faults," an&s;wered Sandford; "for I have &s;een him in very dangerous circum|&s;tances with your father."</P>
<P>"Have you indeed?" cried Matilda: "then I pity him."</P>
<P>"And I believe," &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley, "that from his heart, he compa&s;&s;ionates you. Now, Mr. Sand|ford," continued &s;he, "though this is the fir&s;t time I ever heard you &s;peak in his favour, (and I once
<PB N="321" REF="025650_0323_0FCEB356F3BF96D0">
thought as indifferently of Mr. Ru&s;hbrook as you can do) yet now I will venture to a&s;k you, whether you do not think he wi&s;hes Lady Matilda much hap|pier than &s;he is?"</P>
<P>"I have heard him &s;ay &s;o," an&s;wered Sandford.</P>
<P>"It is a &s;ubject," returned Lady Matilda, "which I did not imagine you, Mr. Sandford, would have permitted to have been lightly mentioned, in your pre&s;ence."</P>
<P>"Lightly!&mdash;Do you &s;uppo&s;e, my dear, we turned your &s;ituation into ridicule?"</P>
<P>"No, Sir,&mdash;but there is a &s;ort of humiliation in the grief to which I am doomed, that ought &s;urely to be treated with the highe&s;t degree of delicacy by my friends."</P>
<P>"I don't know on what point you fix real deli|cacy; but if it con&s;i&s;ts in &s;orrow, the young man gives a proof he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it, for he &s;hed tears when I la&s;t heard him mention your name."</P>
<P>"I have more cau&s;e to weep at the mention of his."</P>
<P>"Perhaps &s;o&mdash;But let me tell you, Lady Matilda, "your father might have preferred a more unwor|thy object."</P>
<P>"Still had he been to me," &s;he cried, "an object of envy. And as I frankly confe&s;s my envy of Mr. Ru&s;hbrook, I hope you will pardon my malice, which is, you know, but a con&s;equent crime."</P>
<P>The &s;ubject now turned again upon Lord Mar|grave; and all of them being firmly per&s;uaded, this la&s;t reception would put an end to every farther in|tru&s;ion from his lord&s;hip, they treated his preten&s;i|ons, and he him&s;elf, with the contempt they in|&s;pired&mdash;but not with the caution they de&s;erved.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XX.</HEAD>
<P>THE next morning early, Mr. Sandford re|turned to Elmwood Hou&s;e, but with his &s;pirits de|pre&s;&s;ed,
<PB N="322" REF="025650_0324_0FCEB326F41363F0">
and his heart overcharged with &s;orrow.&mdash;He had &s;een Lady Matilda, the object of his vi&s;it, but he had beheld her con&s;iderably altered in her looks and in her health; &s;he was become very thin, and in&s;tead of the mo&s;t beautiful bloom that u&s;ed to &s;pread her cheeks, her whole complexion was of a deadly pale&mdash;her countenance no longer expre&s;&s;ed hope or fear, but a fixed melancholy&mdash;&s;he &s;hed no tears, but was all &s;adne&s;s. He had beheld this, and he had heard her in&s;ulted by the licentious propo|&s;als of a nobleman, from whom there was no &s;a|tisfaction to be demanded, becau&s;e &s;he had no friend to vindicate her honour.</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook, who &s;u&s;pected where Sandford was gone, and imagined he would return that day, took his forenoon's ride, &s;o as to meet him on the load a few miles di&s;tance from the ca&s;tle; for &s;ince his perilous &s;ituation with Lord Elmwood, he was &s;o fully convinced of the general philanthropy of Sand|ford's character, that in &s;pite of his churli&s;h man|ners, he now addre&s;&s;ed him, free from that re&s;erve to which his rough behaviour had formerly given birth. And Sandford on his part, believing he had formed an illiberal opinion of Lord Elmwood's heir (though he took no pains to let him know that opinion was changed) yet re&s;olved to make him re|&s;titution upon every occa&s;ion that offered.</P>
<P>Their mutual greetings when they met, were un|ceremonious but cordial; and Ru&s;hbrook turned his hor&s;e and rode back with Sandford; yet, inti|midated by his re&s;pect and tenderne&s;s for Lady Ma|tilda, rather than by fear of the rebuffs of his companion, he had not the courage to name her, till their ride was ju&s;t fini&s;hed, and they came within a few yards of the hou&s;e&mdash;incited then by the ap|prehen&s;ion he might not &s;oon again enjoy &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">it an opportunity, he &s;aid,</P>
<P>"Pardon me, Mr. Sandford, if I gue&s;s where
<PB N="323" REF="025650_0325_0FCEB35994E2AA18">
you have been, and if any curio&s;ity forces me to in|quire for Mi&s;s Woodley's and Lady Matilda's health?"</P>
<P>He named Mi&s;s Woodley fir&s;t, to prolong the time before he mentioned Matilda&mdash;for though to name her gave him extreme plea&s;ure, yet it was a plea&s;ure intermingled with confu&s;ion and pain.</P>
<P>"They are both very well," replied Sandford, "at lea&s;t they did not complain they were &s;ick."</P>
<P>"They are not in &s;pirits, I &s;uppo&s;e?" <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Ru&s;h|brook.</P>
<P>"No, indeed," replied Sandford, &s;haking his head.</P>
<P>"No new misfortune has happened, I hope!" cried Ru&s;hbrook, for it was plain to &s;ee Sandford's &s;pirits were unu&s;ually ca&s;t down.</P>
<P>"Nothing new," returned he, "except the in|&s;olence of a young nobleman."</P>
<P>"What nobleman?" cried Ru&s;hbrook.</P>
<P>"A lover of Lady Matilda's," replied Sandford.</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook was petrified.&mdash;"Who? what lover, Mr. Sandford?&mdash;explain?&mdash;"</P>
<P>They were now arrived at the hou&s;e: and Sand|ford, without making any reply to this que&s;tion, &s;aid to the &s;ervant who took his hor&s;e, "He has come a long way this morning; take care of him."</P>
<P>This interruption was torture to Ru&s;hbrook, who kept clo&s;e to his &s;ide, in order to obtain a farther explanation; but Sandford, without attending to him, walked negligently into the hall, and before they advanced many &s;teps, they were met by Lord Elmwood.</P>
<P>All farther information was for the pre&s;ent, now wholly put an end to.</P>
<P>"How do you do, Sandford?" &s;aid his lord&s;hip with extreme kindne&s;s; as if he thanked him for the journey which he &s;u&s;pected he had been taking.</P>
<P>"I am indifferent well, my lord," replied <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he, with a face of deep concern, and a tear in his eye, partly in gratitude for his lord&s;hip's civility, and partly in reproach for his cruelty.</P>
<P><PB N="324" REF="025650_0326_0FCEB32B43DA7728">
It was not now till the evening, that Ru&s;hbrook had an opportunity of renewing the conver&s;ation, which had been &s;o barbarou&s;ly interrupted.</P>
<P>In the evening, no longer able to &s;upport the &s;u&s;pen&s;e in which he was; without fear or &s;hame he followed Sandford to his chamber at the time of his retiring, and intreated of him, with all the anxiety he &s;uffered, to reveal to him what he al|luded to, when he made mention of a lover, and in&s;olence to Lady Matilda.</P>
<P>Sandford &s;eeing his emotion, was angry he had inadvertently mentioned the &s;ubject; and putting on an air of &s;urly importance, de&s;ired if he had any bu&s;ine&s;s with him, to call in the morning.</P>
<P>Exa&s;perated at &s;o unexpected a reception, and at the pain of his di&s;appointment, Ru&s;hbrook replied, "He treated him cruelly, nor would he &s;tir out of his room, till he had received a &s;atisfactory an&s;wer to his que&s;tion."</P>
<P>"Then bring your bed," replied Sandford "for you mu&s;t pa&s;s your whole night here."</P>
<P>He found it vain to think of obtaining any in|telligence by threats, he therefore &s;aid in a timid per&s;ua&s;ive manner,</P>
<P>"Did you, Mr. Sandford, hear Lady Matilda mention my name?"</P>
<P>"Yes," replied Sandford, a little better recon|ciled to him.</P>
<P>"Did you tell her what I declared to you?" he a&s;ked with more diffidence &s;till.</P>
<P>"No," replied Sandford.</P>
<P>"It is very well, Sir," returned he vexed to the heart.&mdash;Yet again wi&s;hing to &s;ooth him,</P>
<P>"You certainly, Mr. Sandford, know what is for the be&s;t&mdash;yet I intreat you will give me &s;ome farther account of the nobleman you named?"</P>
<P>"I know what is for the be&s;t," replied Sandford, "and I won't."</P>

Ru&s;hbrook bowed, and immediately left the room.&mdash;He went apparently &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, but the moment he &s;howed this &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, he took the re|&s;olution of paying a vi&s;it him&s;elf to the farm where Lady Matilda re&s;ided; and of learning either from Mi&s;s Woodley, the people of the hou&s;e, the neigh|bours, or perhaps from Lady Matilda's own lips, the &s;ecret which the ob&s;tinacy of Sandford had de|nied him.</P>
<P>He &s;aw all the dangers of this undertaking, but none appeared &s;o great as the danger of lo&s;ing her he loved, by the influence of a rival&mdash;and though Sandford had named "in&s;olence," he was in doubt whether what had appeared &s;uch to him, was &s;uch in reality, or would be con&s;idered as &s;uch by her.</P>
<P>To prevent his ab&s;ence being &s;u&s;pected by Lord Elmwood, he immediately called his groom, ordered his hor&s;e, and giving tho&s;e &s;ervants concerned, a &s;trict charge of &s;ecrecy, and &s;ome frivolous pretence to apologi&s;e for his not being pre&s;ent at breakfa&s;t (re&s;olving to be back by dinner) he &s;et off that night, and arrived at an inn about a mile from the farm, at the break of day.</P>
<P>The joy he felt when he found him&s;elf &s;o near to the beloved object of his journey, made him thank Sandford in his heart, for the unkindne&s;s which had &s;ent him thither.&mdash;But new difficulties aro&s;e, how to accompli&s;h the end for which he came;&mdash;he learnt from the people of the inn, that a lord with a fine equipage had vi&s;ited at the farm, but who he was, or for what purpo&s;e he went, no one could inform him.</P>
<P>Mi&s;erable to return with the &s;ame doubts un&s;atis|fied, with which he &s;et out, and yet afraid to pro|ceed to extremities that might be con&s;trued into pre&s;umption, he walked di&s;con&s;olately (almo&s;t di&s;|tractedly) about the fields, looking repeatedly at his watch, and wi&s;hing the time to &s;tand &s;till, till he was ready to go back with his errand compleated.</P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="025650_0328_0FCEB32D0298C3B0">
Every field he pa&s;&s;ed, brought him nearer to the hou&s;e on which his imagination was fixed; but how, without forfeiting every appearance of that very re&s;pect he &s;o powerfully felt, could he attempt to enter it?&mdash;he &s;aw the indecorum, re&s;olved not to be guilty of it, and yet walked on till he was within but a &s;hort orchard of the door. Could he then retreat?&mdash;he wi&s;hed he could; but he now found he had proceeded too far, to be any longer ma&s;ter of him&s;elf.&mdash;The time was urgent; he mu&s;t either be bold, and venture her di&s;plea&s;ure; or by diffidence during one moment, give up all his hopes perhaps for ever.</P>
<P>With that &s;ame di&s;regard to con&s;equences, which actuated him when he dared to &s;upplicate Lord Elm|wood in his daughter's behalf, he at length went eagerly to the door and rapped.</P>
<P>A &s;ervant came&mdash;he a&s;ked to "&s;peak with Mi&s;s Woodley, if &s;he was quite alone." He was &s;hown into an apartment, and Mi&s;s Woodley entered to him.</P>
<P>She &s;tarted when &s;he beheld who it was; but as he did not &s;ee a frown upon her face, he caught hold of her hand, and &s;aid per&s;ua&s;ively,</P>
<P>"Do not be offended with me.&mdash;If I mean to of|fend you, may I forfeit my life in atonement."</P>
<P>"Poor Mi&s;s Woodley, glad in her &s;olitude to &s;ee any one from Elmwood Hou&s;e, forgot his vi&s;it was an offence till he put her in mind of it; &s;he then &s;aid with &s;ome re&s;erve,</P>
<P>"Tell me the purport of your coming, Sir, and perhaps I may then have no cau&s;e to complain?"</P>
<P>"It was to &s;ee Lady Matilda," he replied, "or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o hear of her health. It was to offer her my &s;er|vices&mdash;it was, Mi&s;s Woodley, to convince her, if po&s;&s;ible, of my e&s;teem."</P>
<P>"Had you no other method, Sir?" &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley, with the &s;ame re&s;erve.</P>
<P>"None;" replied he, "or with joy I &s;hould have

<P>Mi&s;s Woodley he&s;itated.</P>
<P>"You know of no other means, Mi&s;s Woodley," he cried.</P>
<P>"And yet I cannot commend this," &s;aid &s;he.</P>
<P>"Nor do I. Do not imagine, becau&s;e you &s;ee me here, I approve my conduct; but reduced to this nece&s;&s;ity, pity the motives that have urged it."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley did pity them; but as &s;he would not own &s;he did, &s;he could think of nothing el&s;e to &s;ay.</P>
<P>At this in&s;tant a bell rung from the chamber above.</P>
<P>"That is Lady Matilda's bell," &s;aid Mi&s;s Wood|ley; "&s;he is coming to take a &s;hort walk.&mdash;Do you wi&s;h to &s;ee her?"</P>

<P>She had &s;tept beyond the door of the apartment, when perceiving a vi&s;itor, &s;he ha&s;tily withdrew.</P>

<P>She immediately &s;aw who it was, and returned back with a proper pride, and yet a proper polite|ne&s;s in her manner.</P>
<P>"I beg your pardon, Sir," &s;aid &s;he, "I did not know you, and I was afraid I intruded upon Mi&s;s Woodley and a &s;tranger."</P>
<P>"You do not then con&s;ider me as a &s;tranger, Lady Matilda? and that you do not, requires my warme&s;t acknowledgments."</P>

<P>He &s;at down with the confe&s;&s;ion of the obliga|tion upon every feature of his face.</P>
<P>"I am not well, Mr. Ru&s;hbrook," &s;aid Matilda, languidly; "and you mu&s;t excu&s;e any want of eti|quette, you meet with at this hou&s;e?"</P>
<P>"While you excu&s;e me, Madam, what can I have to complain of?"</P>

<P>"No, my dear," an&s;wered Mi&s;s Woodley; "the ground is damp, and the air cold."</P>

<P>"Oh!" cried &s;he, interrupting him, and the tears now gu&s;hed in torrents.</P>
<P>"Nay, do not let me add to your unea&s;ine&s;s," re&s;umed he, "while I am attempting to alleviate it. In&s;truct me what I am to do to &s;how my e&s;teem and re&s;pect, rather than permit me thus unguided,

<P>Mi&s;s Woodley went to Matilda, took her hand, then wiped the tears from her eyes, while Matilda reclined again&s;t her, wholly regardle&s;s of Ru&s;h|brook's pre&s;ence.</P>

Here &s;he wept again, as bitterly as before.</P>
<P>"There is no probability of his hearing of it, Madam," Ru&s;hbrook replied; "or if there was, I am per&s;uaded he would not re&s;ent it; for ye&s;ter|day, when I am confident he knew Mr. Sandford had been to &s;ee you, he received him on his return with unu&s;ual marks of kindne&s;s."</P>

<P>"There is &s;omething which we cannot yet define," &s;aid Ru&s;hbrook, "that Lord Elmwood &s;truggles with; but when time &s;hall have eradicated"&mdash;</P>

<P>SORROWFUL and affecting as this inter|view, had been, Ru&s;hbrook as he rode home, re|flected on it with the mo&s;t inordinate delight; and had he not beheld decline of health, in all the looks and behaviour of Lady Matilda, his felicity had been unbounded.&mdash;Entranced in the happine&s;s of her &s;o|ciety, the thought of his rival never came once to his mind while he was with her; a want of recollec|tion, however, he by no means regretted, as her whole appearance contradicted every &s;u&s;picion he could po&s;&s;ibly entertain, of her favouring the ad|dre&s;&s;es of any man living&mdash;and had he remembered, he had not dared to have named the &s;ubject.</P>

<P>His excu&s;es were received, and the &s;ubject cea&s;ed.</P>
<P>During his ab&s;ence that day, Lord Elmwood had called Sandford apart and &s;aid to him, "that as the malevolence which he once ob&s;erved between him and Ru&s;hbrook had, he perceived, &s;ub&s;ided; he advi&s;ed him, if he was a well-wi&s;her to the young man, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound his heart, and coun&s;el him not to act contrary to the will of his neare&s;t relation and friend.

You, Sandford, can rea&s;on with moderation. For after all I have done for my nephew, it would be a pity to for&s;ake him at la&s;t; and yet, that is but too likely, if he pro|vokes me."</P>
<P>"Sir," replied Sandford, "I will &s;peak to him."</P>
<P>"Yet," cried his lord&s;hip &s;ternly, "do not urge what you &s;ay for my &s;ake, but for his&mdash;I can part from him with ea&s;e&mdash;but he may then repent, and, you know, repentance always comes too late with me."</P>

<P>"And as that is the ca&s;e, I need not fear to &s;peak plainly to you.

"In that expectation, then, the failure of which you your&s;elf mu&s;t an&s;wer for, I will repeat to his lord&s;hip, as much of this di&s;cour&s;e as &s;hall be proper."</P>
<P>Here Ru&s;hbrook communicated his having been to &s;ee Lady Matilda, for which Sandford reproved him, but in le&s;s &s;evere terms than his reproofs were in general delivered; and Ru&s;hbrook by his intrea|ties, now gained the intelligence who the nobleman was who had addre&s;t Matilda, and on what views; but was re&s;trained to patience by Sandford's argu|ments and threats.</P>

<P>"I have given him time, have I not," cried Lord Elmwood, "What can be the rea&s;on of his thus trifling with me?"</P>
<P>Sandford replied, "My lord, young men are fre|quently romantic in their notions of love, and think it impo&s;&s;ible to have a &s;incere affection where their own inclinations do not fir&s;t point out the choice."</P>
<P>"If he is in love,' an&s;wered his lord&s;hip, "let him take the object, and leave my hou&s;e and me for ever.

<P>"Your lord&s;hip is talking," replied Sandford, "of the pa&s;&s;ion in its mo&s;t refined and predominant &s;en&s;e; while I may po&s;&s;ibly be &s;peaking of a mere phantom, that has led this young man a&s;tray."</P>

him and his friends weigh the ca&s;e well, and act for the be&s;t&mdash;&s;o &s;hall I."</P>
<P>"His friends, my lord! What friends, or what friend has he on earth but you?"</P>
<P>"Then why will he not &s;ubmit to my advice; or him&s;elf give me &s;ome &s;ub&s;tantial rea&s;on why he cannot?"</P>
<P>"Becau&s;e there may be friend&s;hip without fami|liarity&mdash;and &s;o it is between him and you."</P>
<P>"That cannot be; for I have conde&s;cended to talk to him in the mo&s;t familiar terms."</P>
<P>"To conde&s;cend, my lord, is <HI>not</HI> to be familiar."</P>
<P>"Then come, Sir, let us be on an equal footing through you. And now &s;peak out <HI>his</HI> thoughts freely, and hear mine in return."</P>
<P>"Why then he begs for a re&s;pite for a year or two."</P>
<P>"On what pretence?"</P>
<P>"To me it was a preference to a &s;ingle life&mdash;but I &s;u&s;pect it is&mdash;what he imagines to be love&mdash;for &s;ome object whom he thinks your lord&s;hip would di&s;approve for his wife."</P>
<P>"He has not then, actually confe&s;&s;ed this to you?"</P>
<P>"If he has, it was drawn from him by &s;uch means, I am not warranted to &s;ay &s;o in direct words."</P>
<P>"I have entered into no contract, no agreement on his account with the friends of the lady I have pointed out," &s;aid Lord Elmwood; "nothing be|yond implications have pa&s;&s;ed betwixt her family and my&s;elf at pre&s;ent; and if the per&s;on on whom he has fixed his affections, &s;hould not be in a &s;itu|ation ab&s;olutely contrary to my wi&s;hes, I may, per|haps, confirm his choice."</P>
<P>That moment Sandford's courage prompted him to name Lady Matilda, but his di&s;cretion oppo&s;ed&mdash;however, in the various changes of his counte|nance from the conflict, it was plain to di&s;cern he wi&s;hed to &s;ay more than he dared.</P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="025650_0338_0FCEB335F5A89280">
On which Lord Elmwood cried, "Speak on Sand|ford, what are you afraid of?"</P>
<P>"Of you, my lord."</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip &s;tarted.</P>
<P>Sandford went on&mdash;"I know no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">&mdash;no bond&mdash;no innocence, a protection from your re&s;entment."</P>
<P>"You are right," he replied, &s;ignificantly.</P>
<P>"Then how, my lord, can you encourage me to &s;peak on, when that which I perhaps would &s;ay, may offend you to hear?"</P>
<P>"To what, and whither are you <HI>changing</HI> our &s;ubject?" &s;aid his lord&s;hip. "But Sir, if you know my re&s;entful and relentle&s;s temper, you &s;urely know how to &s;hun it."</P>
<P>"Not, and &s;peak plainly."</P>
<P>"Then di&s;&s;emble."</P>
<P>"No, I'll not do that&mdash;but I'll be &s;ilent."</P>
<P>"A new parade of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. You are more tormenting to me than any one I have about me&mdash;Con&s;tantly on the verge of di&s;obeying my com|mands, that you may recede, and gain my good will by your forbearance. But know, Mr. Sandford, I will not &s;uffer this much longer. If you choo&s;e upon every occa&s;ion we conver&s;e together, (though the mo&s;t remote from the &s;ubject) to think upon my daughter, you mu&s;t either bani&s;h your thoughts, or conceal them, nor by one &s;ign, one item, remind me of her."</P>
<P>"Your daughter did you call her? Can you call your&s;elf her father?"</P>
<P>"I do, Sir&mdash;but I am likewi&s;e the hu&s;band of her mother. And, as &s;uch, I &s;olemnly &s;wear,"&mdash;He was proceeding with violence.</P>
<P>"Oh! my lord," cried Sandford, interrupting him, with his hands cla&s;ped in the mo&s;t fervent &s;up|plication&mdash;"Oh! do not let me draw upon her one oath more of your eternal di&s;plea&s;ure. I'll kneel to beg you to drop the &s;ubject."</P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="025650_0339_0FCEB36780426800">
The inclination he made with his knees bent to the ground, &s;topped Lord Elmwood in&s;tantly. But though it broke in upon his words, it did not alter one angry look&mdash;his eyes darted, and his lips trem|bled with indignation.</P>
<P>Sandford in order to appea&s;e him, bowed and of|fered to withdraw; hoping to be recalled. He wi&s;hed in vain. Lord Elmwood's eyes followed him to the door, expre&s;&s;ive of the plea&s;ure of his ab&s;ence.</P>

<P>THE companions and coun&s;ellors of Lord Margrave, who had &s;o prudently advi&s;ed gentle me|thods in the pur&s;uit of his pa&s;&s;ion, while there was left any hope of their &s;ucce&s;s; now, convinced there was none, as &s;trenuou&s;ly commended open violence;&mdash;and &s;heltered under the con&s;ideration, that their depredations were to be practi&s;ed upon a defencele&s;s woman, who had not one protector, except an old prie&s;t, the &s;ubject of their ridicule;&mdash;a&s;&s;ured like|wi&s;e from the influence of Lord Margrave's wealth, all inferior con&s;equences could be overborne, they &s;aw no room for fears on any &s;ide, and what they wi&s;hed to execute, with care and &s;kill premeditated.</P>
<P>When their &s;cheme was mature for performance, three of his lord&s;hip's cho&s;en companions, with three &s;ervants, trained and tried in all the villainous exploits of their ma&s;ters, &s;et off for the habitation of poor Matilda, and arrived there about the twi|light of the evening.</P>
<P>Near four hours after that time (ju&s;t as the fa|mily were going to bed) they came up to the doors of the hou&s;e, and rapping violently, gave the alarm of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ire, "conjuring all the inhabitants to make their way out immediately, as they would &s;ave their lives."</P>
<P><PB N="338" REF="025650_0340_0FCEB33784B50C30">
The family con&s;i&s;ted of but few per&s;ons, all of whom ran in&s;tantly to the doors and opened them; on which two men ru&s;hed in, and with the plea of &s;aving Lady Matilda from the pretended flames, caught her in their arms, and carried her off; while all the deceived people of the hou&s;e, running ea|gerly to &s;ave them&s;elves, paid no regard to her be|ing taken away, till looking for the cau&s;e for which they had been terrified, they perceived the &s;trata|gem, and the fatal con&s;equences.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t the complaints, &s;orrow, and affright of the people of the farm, Mi&s;s Woodley's &s;en&s;ations wanted a name&mdash;terror and angui&s;h give but a faint de&s;cription of what &s;he &s;uffered&mdash;&s;omething like the approach of death &s;tole over her &s;en&s;es, and &s;he &s;at like one petrified with horror.&mdash;She had no doubt who was the perpetrator of this wickedne&s;s; but how was &s;he to follow? how effect a re&s;cue?</P>
<P>The circum&s;tances of this event, as &s;oon as the people had time to call up their recollection, were &s;ent to a neighbouring magi&s;trate; but little could be hoped from that.&mdash;Who was to &s;wear to the robber? Who undertake to find him out? Mi&s;s Woodley thought of Ru&s;hbrook, of Sandford, of Lord Elmwood, but what could &s;he hope from the want of power in the two former?&mdash;what from the latter, for the want of will? Now &s;tupified, and now di&s;tracted, &s;he walked about the hou&s;e ince&s;|&s;antly, begging for in&s;tructions what &s;he &s;hould do, or how to forget her mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>A tenant of Lord Elmwood's, who occupied a &s;mall farm near to that where Lady Matilda lived, and who was well acquainted with the whole hi&s;|tory of her's and her mother's misfortunes, was re|turning from a neighbouring <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">air ju&s;t as this inhu|man plan was put in execution.&mdash;He heard the cries of a woman in di&s;tre&s;s, and followed the &s;ound till he had arrived at a chai&s;e in waiting, and &s;aw Ma|tilda
<PB N="339" REF="025650_0341_0FCEB36903CEDE68">
placed in it by the &s;ide of two men, who pre|&s;ented pi&s;tols to him as he offered to approach and expo&s;tulate.</P>
<P>The farmer, uncertain who this female was, yet went to the hou&s;e &s;he had been taken from (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s the neare&s;t) with the tale of what he had &s;een; and there, being informed Lady Matilda was her whom he had beheld, this intelligence, joined to the pow|erful effect her &s;creams had on him, made him re|&s;olve to take hor&s;e immediately, and with &s;ome friends, follow the carriage till they &s;hould trace the place to which &s;he was conveyed.</P>
<P>The anxiety, the firmne&s;s di&s;covered in deter|mining on this undertaking, &s;omewhat alleviated the agony Mi&s;s Woodley endured, and &s;he began to hope timely a&s;&s;i&s;tance might yet be given to her be|loved charge.</P>
<P>The man &s;et out, meaning at all events to attempt her relea&s;e; but before he had proceeded far, the few friends that accompanied him began to reflect on the improbability of their &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t a no|bleman, &s;urrounded by &s;ervants, with other at|tendants likewi&s;e, and perhaps even countenanced by the lady's father, whom they pre&s;umed to take from him;&mdash;or if not, while Lord Elmwood be|held the offence with indifference, that was giving it a &s;anction, they might in vain oppo&s;e.&mdash;The&s;e cool reflections, tending to their &s;afety, had their weight with the companions of the farmer; they all rode <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> at their &s;econd thoughts, and left him to pur&s;ue his journey, and prove his valour by him&s;elf.</P>

<P>IT was not with Sandford, as it had lately been with Ru&s;hbrook under the di&s;plea&s;ure of Lord Elm|wood
<PB N="340" REF="025650_0342_0FCEB33B28C71258">
&mdash;to the latter his lord&s;hip behaved, as &s;oon as their di&s;&s;ention was over, as if it had never hap|pened&mdash;but to Sandford it was otherwi&s;e; and that re&s;entment which he had repre&s;&s;ed at the time of the offence, lurked in his heart, and dwelt upon his mind for &s;everal days; during which, he care|fully avoided exchanging a word with him, and gave every other demon&s;tration of his anger.</P>
<P>Sandford, who was experienced in the cruelty and ingratitude of the world, yet could not without difficulty brook this &s;everity, this contumely, from a man, for who&s;e welfare, ever &s;ince his infancy, he had laboured; and who&s;e happine&s;s was &s;till more dear to him, in &s;pite of all his faults, than any other per&s;on's.&mdash;Even Lady Matilda was not &s;o dear to Sandford as her father&mdash;and he loved her more that &s;he was Lord Elmwood's child, than for any other cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Sometimes the old man, incen&s;ed beyond bear|ing, was on the point of &s;aying to his patron, "How in my age, dare you thus treat the man, whom in his youth you re&s;pected and revered?"</P>
<P>Sometimes in&s;tead of anger, he felt the tear, he was a&s;hamed to own, &s;teal to his eye, and even fall down his cheek.&mdash;Sometimes he left the room, half determined to leave the hou&s;e&mdash;but the&s;e were all but half determinations; for he knew him with whom he had to deal too well, not to know he might be provoked to greater anger yet; and that &s;hould he once ra&s;hly quit his hou&s;e, the doors mo&s;t pro|bably would be &s;hut to him for ever.</P>
<P>In this humiliating and degraded &s;tate (for even many of the dome&s;tics could not but ob&s;erve their lord's di&s;plea&s;ure) Sandford pa&s;&s;ed three days, and was beginning the fourth, when &s;itting with his lord&s;hip and Ru&s;hbrook ju&s;t after breakfa&s;t, a &s;er|vant entered, &s;aying as he opened the door to &s;ome|body who followed, "You mu&s;t wait till you have my lord's permi&s;&s;ion."</P>
<P><PB N="341" REF="025650_0343_0FCEB36C738A6D70">
This attracted their eyes to the door, and a man meanly dre&s;&s;ed, walked in, following clo&s;e to the &s;ervant.</P>
<P>The latter turned, and &s;eemed again to de&s;ire the per&s;on to retire, but all in vain; he ru&s;hed for|ward regardle&s;s of his oppo&s;er, and in a great agi|tation, cried,</P>
<P>"My lord, if you plea&s;e, I have bu&s;ine&s;s with you, provided you will choo&s;e to be alone."</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood, &s;truck with the &s;tranger's earne&s;t|ne&s;s, bade the &s;ervant leave the room; and then &s;aid to him,</P>
<P>"You may &s;peak before the&s;e gentlemen."</P>
<P>The man in&s;tantly turned pale, and trembled&mdash;then, to prolong the time before he &s;poke, went to the door to &s;ee if it was &s;hut&mdash;returned&mdash;yet &s;till trembling, &s;eemed unwilling to &s;ay his errand.</P>
<P>"What have you done," cried Lord Elmwood, "that you are in this terror? What have you done, man?"</P>
<P>"Nothing, my lord," replied he, "but I am a|fraid I am going to offend you."</P>
<P>"Well, no matter;" (an&s;wered his lord&s;hip carele&s;sly) "only go on, and let me know your bu&s;ine&s;s."</P>
<P>The man's di&s;tre&s;s increa&s;ed&mdash;the water came to his eyes&mdash;and he cried in a voice of grief and of af|fright&mdash;"Your child, my lord!"</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook and Sandford &s;tarted; and looking at Lord Elmwood, &s;aw him turn white as death.&mdash;In a tremulous voice he in&s;tantly cried,</P>
<P>"What of her&punc;" and ro&s;e from his &s;eat.</P>
<P>Encouraged by the que&s;tion, the poor man gave way to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">his feelings, and an&s;wered with every &s;ign of &s;orrow,</P>
<P>"I &s;aw her, my lord, taken away by force&mdash;two ruffians &s;eized and carried her away, while &s;he

&s;creamed in vain to me for help, and tore her hair indi&s;traction,"</P>
<P>"Man, what do you mean?" cried his lord&s;hip.</P>
<P>"Lord Margrave," returned the &s;tranger, "we have no doubt has formed the plot&mdash;he has for &s;ome time pa&s;t be&s;et the hou&s;e where &s;he lived; and when his vi&s;its were refu&s;ed, he threatened this.&mdash;Be&s;ides, one of his &s;ervants attended the carriage; I &s;aw, and knew him."</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood li&s;tened to the la&s;t part of this account with &s;eeming compo&s;ure&mdash;then turning ha&s;tily to Ru&s;hbrook, he &s;aid,</P>
<P>"Where are my pi&s;tols, Harry?"</P>
<P>Sandford ro&s;e from his &s;eat, and forgetting all the anger between them, caught hold of his lord|&s;hip's hand, and cried, "Will you then prove your|&s;elf a father?"</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood only an&s;wered, "Yes," and left the room.</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook followed, and begged with all the earne&s;tne&s;s he felt, to be permitted to accompany his uncle.</P>
<P>While Sandford &s;haked hands with the farmer a thou&s;and times.</P>
<P>And he, in his turn, rejoiced as if he had already &s;een Lady Matilda re&s;tored to liberty.</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook in vain intreated Lord Elmwood; he laid his commands upon him not to &s;tir from the ca&s;tle; while the agitation of his own mind was too great to ob&s;erve the rigour of his &s;entence upon his nephew.</P>
<P>During the ha&s;ty preparations for his lord&s;hip's departure, Sandford received from Mi&s;s Woodley the &s;ad intelligence of what had happened;&mdash;but he returned an an&s;wer to recompen&s;e her for all &s;he had undergone.</P>
<P>Within a few hours Lord Elmwood &s;et off, ac|companied by his guide the farmer, and other at|tendants

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXIV.</HEAD>
<P>LORD MARGRAVE, black as this incident in his &s;tory mu&s;t make him to the reader, &s;till nur&s;ed in his con&s;cience a re&s;erve of virtue, to keep him in peace with him&s;elf. It was his de&s;ign to plead, to argue, to implore, nay even to threaten, long be|fore he put his threats in force; and with this and the following reflection he reconciled, as mo&s;t bad men can, what he had done, not only to the laws of humanity, but to the laws of honour.</P>
<P>"I have &s;tolen a woman certainly;" &s;aid he to him&s;elf, "but I will make her happier than &s;he was in that humble &s;tate from whence I have taken her. I will even," &s;aid he, "now &s;he is in my power, win her affections&mdash;and when, in fondne&s;s, &s;he &s;hall hereafter hang upon me, how will &s;he thank me for this little trial, through which &s;he will have pa&s;&s;ed to happine&s;s?"</P>
<P>Thus did his lord&s;hip hu&s;h his remor&s;e, while he waited impatiently at home, in expectation of his prize.</P>
<P>Half expiring with her &s;ufferings, in body as well as in mind, about twelve o'clock the next night Matilda arrived; and felt her &s;pirits revive by the &s;till greater &s;ufferings that awaited, for her increa&s;ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">errors now rou&s;ed her from that death-like weak|ne&s;s, brought on by fatigue.</P>
<P>Lord Margrave's hou&s;e, to which he had gone
<PB N="344" REF="025650_0346_0FCEB33D72C81B58">
previous to this occa&s;ion, was &s;ituated in the lonely part of a well-known fore&s;t, not more than twenty miles di&s;tant from London: this was an e&s;tate he rarely vi&s;ited; and as he had but few of his &s;ervants here, it was a place which he &s;uppo&s;ed would be le&s;s the object of &s;u&s;picion in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, than any other of his &s;eats. To this, then, Lady Ma|tilda was conveyed, a mo&s;t &s;uperb apartment al|lotted her, and one of his lord&s;hip's confidential females placed to attend upon her, with all re&s;pect and a&s;&s;urances of &s;afety.</P>
<P>Matilda looked in this woman's face, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eeing &s;he bore the features of her &s;ex, while her know|ledge reached none of tho&s;e worthle&s;s characters of which this per&s;on was a &s;pecimen, &s;he imagined none of tho&s;e could look as &s;he did, and therefore found con&s;olation in her &s;eeming tenderne&s;s. She was even prevailed upon (by her promi&s;es to &s;it by her &s;ide and watch) to throw her&s;elf on the bed, and &s;uffer a few minutes &s;leep&mdash;for &s;leep to her was &s;uffering; her fears giving birth to dreams terrify|ing as her waking thoughts.</P>
<P>More wearied than refre&s;hed with her &s;leep, &s;he ro&s;e at break of day, and refu&s;ing to admit of an article in the change of dre&s;s, &s;he per&s;i&s;ted to &s;it in the torn di&s;ordered habit in which &s;he had been dragged away; nor would &s;he ta&s;te a mor&s;el of all the delicacies that were prepared for her.</P>
<P>Her attendant for &s;ome time ob&s;erved the mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive and reverential awe; but finding this had not the effect of gaining compliance to her advice, &s;he varied her manners, and began by le&s;s &s;ervile means to attempt an influence. She &s;aid her orders were to be obedient, while &s;he her&s;elf was obeyed&mdash;at lea&s;t in circum&s;tances &s;o material as the lady's health, of which &s;he had the charge as a phy&s;ician, and expected equal compliance from her patient&mdash;food and fre&s;h apparel &s;he pre&s;cribed as the only
<PB N="345" REF="025650_0347_0FCEB36D96732D58">
means to prevent death; and even threatened her invalid with &s;omething wor&s;e, a vi&s;it from Lord Margrave, if &s;he continued ob&s;tinate.</P>
<P>Now loathing her for the deception &s;he had prac|ti&s;ed, more, than had &s;he received her thus at fir&s;t, Matilda hid her eyes from the &s;ight of her; and when &s;he was obliged to look, &s;he &s;huddered.</P>
<P>This female at length thought it her duty to wait upon her worthy employer, and inform him the young lady in her tru&s;t would certainly die, unle&s;s there were means employed to oblige her to take &s;ome nouri&s;hment.</P>
<P>Lord Margrave, glad of an opportunity that might apologize for his intru&s;ion upon Lady Matilda, went with eagerne&s;s to her apartment, and throw|ing him&s;elf at her feet, conjured her if &s;he would &s;ave his life, as well as her own, to &s;ubmit to be con&s;oled.</P>
<P>The extreme di&s;gu&s;t and horror his pre&s;ence in|&s;pired, cau&s;ed Matilda for a moment to forget all her weakne&s;s, her want of health, her want of power; and ri&s;ing from the place where &s;he &s;at, &s;he cried, and with her voice elevated,</P>
<P>"Leave me, my lord, or I'll die in &s;pite of all your care; I'll in&s;tantly expire with grief, if you do not leave me."</P>
<P>Accu&s;tomed to the tears and reproaches of the &s;ex, though not of any like her, his lord&s;hip treated with contempt tho&s;e menaces of anger, and &s;eizing her hand, carried it to his lips.</P>
<P>Enraged, and overwhelmed with &s;orrow at the af|front, &s;he cried, (forgetting every other friend &s;he had,) "Oh! my dear Mi&s;s Woodley, why are you not here to take my part?"</P>
<P>"Nay," returned his lord&s;hip, &s;tifling a fit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">f laughter, "I &s;hould think the old prie&s;t, would be as good a champion as the lady."</P>
<P>The memory of Sandford, with all his kindne&s;s,
<PB N="346" REF="025650_0348_0FCEB37BB9E916A8">
now ru&s;hed &s;o forcibly on Matilda's mind, &s;he &s;hed a &s;hower of tears, thinking how much he felt, and would continue to feel, for her &s;ituation<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Once &s;he thought on Ru&s;hbrook too, and thought even <HI>he</HI> would be vext for her. Of her father &s;he did not think, &s;he dur&s;t not; one &s;ingle time the thought intruded, but &s;he hurried it away, it was too bitter.</P>
<P>It was now quite night again; and near to that hour &s;he came fir&s;t to the hou&s;e.&mdash;Lord Margrave, though at &s;ome di&s;tance from her, remained &s;till in her apartment; while her female companion had &s;tolen away. His in&s;en&s;ibility to her lamentations, the agitated looks he &s;ometimes ca&s;t upon her, her weakly and defencele&s;s &s;tate, all con&s;pired to fill her mind with horror.</P>
<P>He &s;aw her apprehen&s;ions pictured in her di&s;|tracted face, di&s;heveled hair, and the whole of her forlorn appearance,&mdash;yet, notwith&s;tanding his for|mer re&s;olves, he could not re&s;i&s;t the de&s;ire of ful|filling all her dreadful expectations.</P>
<P>He once again approached her, and was going a|gain to take her hand; when the report of a pi&s;tol on the &s;tairca&s;e, and a confu&s;ion of per&s;ons a&s;&s;em|bling towards the apartment deterred him.</P>
<P>He &s;tarted&mdash;but looked more &s;urpri&s;ed than a|larmed; while her alarm augmented; for &s;he &s;up|po&s;ed this tumult was &s;ome experiment to intimi|date her into &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. She therefore wrung her hands, and lifted up her eyes to heaven in the la&s;t agony of de&s;pair, when one of Lord Margrave's &s;ervants entered, and ha&s;tily cried,</P>
<P>"Lord Elmwood, Sir."</P>
<P>That moment her father entered&mdash;and with the unre&s;trained fondne&s;s of a parent, folded her in his arms.</P>
<P>Her extreme, her exce&s;s of joy on &s;uch a meet|ing; and from &s;uch angui&s;h re&s;cued, was &s;till, in

<P>Lord Margrave, on whom Lord Elmwood had not even ca&s;t a look, now left the room; but as he quitted it, called out,</P>
<P>"My Lord Elmwood, if you have any demands on me"&mdash;</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip interrupted him,&mdash;"Would you make me an executioner? The law &s;hall be your only antagoni&s;t."</P>
<P>Matilda, quite exhau&s;ted, yet upheld by the &s;ud|den tran&s;port &s;he had felt, walked, as her father led her, out of this wretched dwelling&mdash;more de&s;|picable than the cottage built with clay.</P>

<P>OVERCOME with the want of two night's re&s;t from her cruel fears, and all tho&s;e fears now hu&s;hed; Matilda &s;oon after &s;he was placed in the carriage with Lord Elmwood, dropped fa&s;t a&s;leep; and thus in&s;en&s;ibly &s;urpri&s;ed, leaned her head again&s;t her father in the &s;weete&s;t &s;lumber imagination can conceive.</P>
<P>When &s;he awoke, in&s;tead of the u&s;ual melan|choly pro&s;pect before her view, &s;he heard the voice of the late dreadful Lord Elmwood, tenderly &s;aying,</P>
<P><PB N="348" REF="025650_0350_0FCEB37E197E1B98">
"We will go no farther to-night, the fatigue is too much for her;&mdash;order beds here directly, and &s;ome proper per&s;ons to &s;it up and attend her."</P>
<P>She could only turn to him with a look of love and duty; her tongue could not utter a &s;entence.</P>
<P>In the morning &s;he found her father by the &s;ide of her bed.&mdash;He inquired, "If &s;he was in health &s;ufficient to pur&s;ue her journey, or if &s;he would re|main where &s;he was?"</P>
<P>"I am able to go with you," &s;he an&s;wered in|&s;tantly.</P>
<P>"Nay," replied he, "perhaps you ought to &s;tay here till you are better?"</P>
<P>"I <HI>am</HI> better," &s;aid &s;he, "and ready to go with you."&mdash;Half afraid he meant to &s;end her from him.</P>
<P>He perceived her fears, and replied, "Nay if you &s;tay, &s;o &s;hall I&mdash;and when I go, I &s;hall take you along with me to my hou&s;e."</P>
<P>"To Elmwood Hou&s;e?" &s;he a&s;ked eagerly.</P>
<P>"No, to my hou&s;e in town, where I intend to be all the winter, and where we &s;hall live toge|ther."</P>
<P>She turned her face on the pillow to conceal her tears of joy, but her &s;obs revealed them.</P>
<P>"Come," &s;aid he, "this ki&s;s is a token you have nothing to fear."&mdash;And he ki&s;&s;ed her affectionately.&mdash;"I &s;hall &s;end too for Mi&s;s Woodley immediately," continued he.</P>
<P>"Oh! I &s;hall be overjoyed to &s;ee her, my Lord&mdash;and to &s;ee Mr. Sandford&mdash;and even Mr. Ru&s;h|brook."</P>
<P>"Do you know him?" &s;aid Lord Elmwood.</P>
<P>"Yes," &s;he replied, "I have &s;een him twice."</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip hoping the air might be a means of re-e&s;tabli&s;hing her &s;trength and &s;pirits, now left the room and ordered his carriage; while &s;he aro&s;e, at|tended by one of his female &s;ervants, for whom he
<PB N="349" REF="025650_0351_0FCE9F2CB08D9890">
had &s;ent to town, to bring &s;uch changes of apparel as was requi&s;ite.</P>
<P>When Matilda was ready to join her father in the next room, &s;he felt a tremour &s;eize her, that made it almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to appear before him.&mdash;No other circum&s;tance now depending to agitate her heart, &s;he felt more forcibly its embarra&s;&s;ment at meeting on terms of ea&s;y intercour&s;e, him, whom &s;he had been u&s;ed to think of, but with that di&s;tant reverence and fear, which his &s;everity had excited; and &s;he knew not how to dare to &s;peak, or look on him with that freedom her affection warranted.</P>
<P>After &s;everal efforts to conquer the&s;e nice and refined &s;en&s;ations, but to no purpo&s;e, &s;he went at la&s;t to his apartment.&mdash;He was reading; but as &s;he entered, put out his hand and drew her to him.&mdash;Her tears wholly overcame her.&mdash;He could have intermingled his&mdash;but a&s;&s;uming a grave counte|nance, he commanded her to de&s;i&s;t from exhau&s;ting her &s;pirits; and, after a few powerful &s;truggles, &s;he obeyed.</P>
<P>Before the morning was over, &s;he experienced the extreme joy of &s;itting by her father's &s;ide as they drove to town, and receiving during his conver&s;a|tion, a thou&s;and proofs of his love, and tokens of her la&s;ting happine&s;s.</P>
<P>It was now the middle of November, and yet as Matilda pa&s;&s;ed along, the fields to her delighted eye appeared green; the trees in their bloom; and every bird &s;eemed to &s;ing the &s;weete&s;t mu&s;ic&mdash;Never to her, did the &s;un ri&s;e upon a morning &s;uch as this&mdash;never did her imagination compre|hend the human heart could feel happine&s;s &s;o true as her's.</P>
<P>On arriving at the hou&s;e, there was no abate|ment of her felicity&mdash;all was re&s;pect and duty on the part of the dome&s;tics&mdash;all paternal care on the

part of Lord Elmwood;&mdash;and &s;he &s;eemed to be at that &s;ummit of her wi&s;hes which annihilates hope, but that the pro&s;pect of &s;eeing Mi&s;s Woodley and Mr. Sandford, &s;till kept this plea&s;ing pa&s;&s;ion in ex|i&s;tence.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXVI.</HEAD>
<P>RUSHBROOK was detained at Elmwood Hou&s;e during all this time, more from the friendly per&s;ua&s;ions, nay even prayers, of Sandford, than by the commands of Lord Elmwood. He had, but for Sandford, followed his uncle, and expo&s;ed him|&s;elf to his &s;evere&s;t anger, rather than have endured a &s;tate of the mo&s;t piercing inquietude, &s;uch as he &s;uffered till the news arrived of Lady Matilda's &s;afety.&mdash;He indeed had little el&s;e to fear from the known, firm, and courageous character of her fa|ther, and the expedition with which he undertook his journey; but lover's fears are like tho&s;e of wo|men, and no argument could per&s;uade either him or Mi&s;s Woodley (who had now ventured to come to Elmwood Hou&s;e) but that Matilda's peace of mind might be for ever de&s;troyed before &s;he was &s;et at liberty.</P>
<P>The &s;ummons from Lord Elmwood for their coming to town, was received by each of this party with delight; but the impatience to obey it was in Ru&s;hbrook &s;o violent, it was painful to him&s;elf, and extremely trouble&s;ome to Sandford; who wi&s;hed, from his regard to Lady Matilda, rather to delay, than hurry their journey.</P>
<P>"You are to blame," &s;aid he to him and to Mi&s;s Woodley, "to wi&s;h by your arrival, to divide with Lord Elmwood that tender tie, with which obliga|tions
<PB N="351" REF="025650_0353_0FCEB37553645B00">
conferred ever binds the donor.&mdash;At pre&s;ent there is no one with him to &s;hare in the care and protection of his daughter, and he is under the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of di&s;charging the duty him&s;elf; accu&s;tomed to this, it may become &s;o powerful he cannot throw it off, even if his former re&s;olutions &s;hould urge him to it.&mdash;While we remain here, therefore, Lady Matilda is &s;afe with her father; but it would not &s;urpri&s;e me, if on our arrival (e&s;pecially if we are precipitate) he &s;hould place her again with Mi&s;s Woodley at a di&s;tance."</P>
<P>To this forcible conjecture, they &s;ubmitted for a few days, and then mo&s;t gladly &s;et out for town.</P>
<P>On their arrival, they were met, even at the door of the &s;treet, by Lady Matilda; and with an ex|pre&s;&s;ion of joy, they did not &s;uppo&s;e her features could have worn.&mdash;She embraced Mi&s;s Woodley! hung upon Sandford!&mdash;and to Mr. Ru&s;hbrook, who from his con&s;cious love only bowed at an humble di&s;tance, &s;he held out her hand with every look and ge&s;ture of the tendere&s;t e&s;teem.</P>
<P>When Lord Elmwood joined them, he welcomed them all mo&s;t &s;incerely; e&s;pecially Sandford; with whom he had not &s;poken for many days before he left the country, merely for his alluding to the wretched &s;ituation of his daughter.&mdash;And Sandford (with his fellow-travellers) now &s;aw his lord&s;hip treat that daughter with all the ea&s;y, natural fond|ne&s;s, as if &s;he had lived with him from her infancy. He appeared, however, at times, under the appre|hen&s;ion, that the propen&s;ity of man to jealou&s;y, might give Ru&s;hbrook a pang at this dangerous ri|val in his love and fortune&mdash;for though his lord|&s;hip remembered well the hazard he had once ven|tured to befriend Matilda, yet the pre&s;ent unli|mited reconciliation was &s;omething &s;o unlooked for, it might be a trial too much for his genero&s;ity, to
<PB N="352" REF="025650_0354_0FCEB380F47D60C0">
remain wholly di&s;intere&s;ted on the event. Slight as was this &s;u&s;picion, it did Ru&s;hbrook inju&s;tice.&mdash;He loved Lady Matilda too &s;incerely; he loved her father's happine&s;s, and her mother's memory too faithfully, not to be rejoiced at all he was witne&s;s of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> did the &s;ecret hope that whi&s;pered to him, "There every ble&s;&s;ing might one day be mutual," increa&s;e the plea&s;ure he found, in beholding Ma|tilda happy.</P>
<P>Unexpected affairs, in which Lord Elmwood had been for &s;ome time engaged, diverted his attention for a while from the marriage of his nephew; nor did he at this time find his di&s;po&s;ition &s;ufficiently &s;evere to exact from the young man a compliance with his wi&s;hes, at the cruel alternative of being for ever di&s;carded.&mdash;He felt his mind, by the late incident, too much &s;oftened for &s;uch har&s;hne&s;s; he yet wi&s;hed for the alliance he had propo&s;ed; for he was more con&s;i&s;tent in his character, than to &s;uffer the &s;udden tenderne&s;s his daughter's danger had awakened, to derange tho&s;e plans &s;o long pro|jected; and never for a moment did he indulge&mdash;for perhaps it had been an indulgence&mdash;the idea of replacing her exactly in that &s;ituation to which &s;he was born, to the di&s;appointment of all his nephew's expectations.</P>
<P>Milder now in his temper than he had been for years before, and knowing he could be no longer irritated upon the &s;ubject of his daughter, his lord|&s;hip once more re&s;olved to tru&s;t him&s;elf in a con|ference with Ru&s;hbrook on the &s;ubject of marriage, meaning at the &s;ame time to mention Matilda as an opponent from whom he had nothing to fear. But for &s;ome time before Ru&s;hbrook was called to his private audience, he had by his unwearied attention, endeavoured to impre&s;s upon Matilda's mind, the &s;ofte&s;t &s;entiments in his favour.&mdash;He &s;ucceeded&mdash;but not as he wi&s;hed.&mdash;She loved him as her friend,
<PB N="353" REF="025650_0355_0FCEB378F986FD60">
her cou&s;in, her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ter-brother, but not as a lover.&mdash;The idea of love never once came to her thoughts; and &s;he would &s;port with Ru&s;hbrook like the mo&s;t harmle&s;s child; while he, all impa&s;&s;ioned, could with difficulty re&s;i&s;t telling her, what &s;he made him &s;uffer.</P>
<P>At the meeting between him and Lord Elmwood, to which he was &s;ent for to give his final an&s;wer on that &s;ubject which had once nearly proved &s;o fatal to him; after a thou&s;and fears, much confu&s;ion and embarra&s;&s;ment, he at length frankly confe&s;&s;ed his "Heart was engaged, and had been &s;o, long before his lord&s;hip offered to direct his choice."</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood de&s;ired to know "on whom he had placed his affections?"</P>
<P>"I dare not tell you, my lord,"&mdash;returned he, infinitely confu&s;ed; but Mr. Sandford can witne&s;s their &s;incerity, and how long they have been fixed."</P>
<P>"Fixed!" cried his lord&s;hip.</P>
<P>"Immoveably fixed, my lord; and yet the ob|ject is as unknowing of it to this moment, as you your&s;elf have been; and I &s;wear ever &s;hall be &s;o, without your permi&s;&s;ion."</P>
<P>"Name the object," &s;aid Lord Elmwood, anxi|ou&s;ly.</P>
<P>"My lord, I dare not&mdash;the la&s;t time I named her to you, you threatened to abandon me for my ar|rogance."</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood &s;tarted.&mdash;"My daughter!&mdash;Would you marry her?"</P>
<P>"But with your approbation, my lord; and that"&mdash;</P>
<P>Before he could proceed a word farther, his lord|&s;hip left the room ha&s;tily&mdash;and left Ru&s;hbrook all terror for his approaching fate.</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood went immediately into the apart|ment, where Sandford, Mi&s;s Woodley, and Matilda
<PB N="354" REF="025650_0356_0FD02D504BDD4EC8">
were &s;itting, and cried with an angry voice, and with his countenance di&s;ordered,</P>
<P>"Ru&s;hbrook has offended me beyond forgive|ne&s;s. Go, Sandford, to the library, where he is, and tell him this in&s;tant to quit my hou&s;e, and never dare to return."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley lifted up her hands and &s;ighed.</P>
<P>Sandford ro&s;e &s;lowly from his &s;eat to execute his office.</P>
<P>While Lady Matilda, who was arranging her mu&s;ic-books upon the in&s;trument, &s;topped from her employment &s;uddenly, with her face bathed in tears.</P>
<P>A general &s;ilence en&s;ued, till Lord Elmwood, re|&s;uming his angry tone, cried, "Did you hear me, Mr. Sandford?"</P>
<P>Sandford now, without a word in reply, made for the door&mdash;but there Matilda impeded him, and throwing her arms about his neck, cried,</P>
<P>"Dear Mr. Sandford, do not."</P>
<P>"How!" exclaimed her father.</P>
<P>She &s;aw the frown that was impending, and ru&s;h|ing towards him, took his hand fearfully, and knelt at his feet.&mdash;"Mr. Ru&s;hbrook is my relation," &s;he cried in a pathetic voice, "my companion, my friend&mdash;before you loved me, he was anxious for my happine&s;s, and often vi&s;ited me to propo&s;e &s;ome kindne&s;s. I cannot &s;ee him turned out of your hou&s;e without feeling <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> him, what he once felt for me."</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood turned a&s;ide to conceal his &s;en&s;a|tions&mdash;then rai&s;ing her from the floor, he &s;aid, "Do you know what he a&s;ked of me?"</P>
<P>"No,"&mdash;an&s;wered &s;he in the utmo&s;t ignorance, and with the utmo&s;t innocence painted on her face.</P>
<P>"But whatever it is, my lord, though you do not grant it, yet pardon him for a&s;king."</P>
<P>"Perhaps <HI>you</HI> would grant him what he has re|que&s;ted?" &s;aid his lord&s;hip.</P>
<P><PB N="355" REF="025650_0357_0FCEB37A37D8B8F0">
"Mo&s;t willingly&mdash;was it in my gift."</P>
<P>"It is," replied he, "And go to him in the li|brary, and hear what he has to &s;ay;&mdash;for on your will his fate &s;hall depend."</P>
<P>Like lightning &s;he flew out of the room; while even the grave Sandford &s;miled at the idea of their meeting.</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook, with his fears all verified by the man|ner in which his uncle had left him, &s;at with his head reclined again&s;t a book-ca&s;e, and every limb extended with the de&s;pair that had &s;eized him.</P>
<P>Matilda nimbly opened the door and cried, "Mr. Ru&s;hbrook, I am come to comfort you."</P>
<P>"That you have always done," &s;aid he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> ri&s;ing in rap|ture to receive her, even in the mid&s;t of all his &s;adne&s;s.</P>
<P>"What is it you want?" &s;aid &s;he, "What have you a&s;ked of my father that he has denied you?"</P>
<P>"I have a&s;ked for that," replied he, "which is dearer to me than my life."</P>
<P>"Be &s;atisfied then," returned &s;he, "for you &s;hall have it."</P>
<P>"Dear Matilda! it is not in your power to be&s;tow."</P>
<P>"But his lord&s;hip has told me, it <HI>&s;hall</HI> be in my power; and has de&s;ired me to give, or to refu&s;e it you, at my own plea&s;ure."</P>
<P>"O Heavens!" cried Ru&s;hbrook in tran&s;port, "Has he?"</P>
<P>"He has indeed&mdash;before Mr. Sandford and Mi&s;s Woodley.&mdash;Now tell me what your petition is?"</P>
<P>"I a&s;ked him," cried Ru&s;hbrook, trembling, "for a wife."</P>
<P>Her hand, that had ju&s;t then taken hold of his, in the warmth of her wi&s;h to &s;erve him, now dropped <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> as with the &s;troke of death, her face lo&s;t its colour, and &s;he leaned again&s;t the de&s;k by which they were &s;tanding, without uttering a word.</P>
<P>"What means this change," &s;aid he; "Do you not wi&s;h <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> happy?"</P>
<P><PB N="356" REF="025650_0358_0FCEB382A47874D0">
"Yes," &s;he exclaimed: "Heaven is my witne&s;s. But it gives me concern to think we mu&s;t part."</P>
<P>"Then let us be joined," cried he, falling at her feet, "till death alone can part us."</P>
<P>All the &s;en&s;ibility, the re&s;erve, the pride, with which &s;he was &s;o amply po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, returned to her that moment. She &s;tarted, and cried, "Could Lord Elmwood know for what he has &s;ent me?"</P>
<P>"He did," replied Ru&s;hbrook&mdash;"I boldly told him of my pre&s;umptuous love, and he has yielded to you alone, the power over my happine&s;s or mi|&s;ery.&mdash;Oh! do not doom me to the latter."</P>
