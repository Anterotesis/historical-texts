<SALUTE>Rev. and dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have read the Pamphlet, intitled, "<HI>The State of Religion in New-England,</HI> &s;ince the Rev. Mr. <HI>George Whitefield'</HI>s Arrival there, in a Letter from a Gen|tleman in <HI>New-England</HI> to his Friend in <HI>Gla&s;gow</HI>"&mdash;I think the Contents no Way an&s;wer the Title-Page&mdash;It rather ought to be intitled, <HI>The State of Religion fal&s;ly Stated</HI>&mdash;For I am per&s;waded &s;ome Things are therein a&s;&s;erted without &s;ufficient Evidence to prove them, and many more Things &s;et in a very wrong Light:&mdash;The De&s;ign of the Pamphlet it&s;elf is ba&s;e and wicked&mdash;It's intended if po&s;&s;ible, to eclip&s;e the late great and glorious Work, begun and carried on for &s;ome Time in <HI>New-England,</HI> to invalidate the Te&s;timonies that have been given of it, and thereby of Con&s;equence to bring a Re|proach upon, and to hinder the &s;preading of a like glo|rious Work, which GOD of his infinite Mercy has for &s;ome Time been carrying on in this Land&mdash;Give me
<PB N="4" REF="005313_0003_10180E429FA2EC38">
Leave to &s;end you a few Ob&s;ervations upon this <HI>Anony|mous</HI> Pamphlet. I call it <HI>Anonymous,</HI> becau&s;e the Pub|li&s;her has not thought proper to put down the Name of the Writer of the fir&s;t Letter Mr. <HI>A. M.</HI> at length, which I think he was bound in Duty to do&mdash;The Pub|li&s;her indeed in the Adverti&s;ement prefix'd to the Let|ter tells us, <Q>The Reader may depend upon it, that the following Letter is Genuine, from a Gentleman who hath always had a good Character for &s;ound Under|&s;tanding, Integrity, Sobriety of Manners, Piety, and notwith&s;tanding his Engagements in &s;ecular Affairs, has never been an unconcern'd Spectator of any Thing that might affect the State of Religion.</Q> But I mu&s;t beg the Publi&s;her's Pardon, if I tell him&punc; That I am one of tho&s;e Readers who cannot depend upon all this merely upon his de&s;iring me to do &s;o.&mdash;For really there is one Thing in the Letter which makes me &s;hrewdly &s;u&s;pect, that the Letter it&s;elf is not Genuine, at lea&s;t that there has been &s;ome Additions made to it &s;ince it came to <HI>Scotland</HI>&mdash;For the &s;uppo&s;ed Writer of this Letter, Page 15, &s;ays, <Q>In the <HI>Preface</HI> to the Ser|mon publi&s;hed by Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> of <HI>Northampton,</HI> which <HI>I &s;ee is reprinted among you.</HI></Q> Now, how this Gentleman <HI>May</HI> 24<HI>th</HI> could &s;ee at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> that Mr. <HI>Ed|wards'</HI>s Sermon was reprinted in <HI>Scotland,</HI> which was not done 'till the <HI>June</HI> following, I know not. If it be &s;aid, that by the Words <HI>among you</HI> he means in <HI>Britain,</HI> I &s;ee that the printed Adverti&s;ement in the <HI>London Weekly Hi&s;tory,</HI> of the Publication of Mr. <HI>Edwards'</HI>s Sermon in <HI>England,</HI> is dated <HI>May</HI> 1<HI>&s;t,</HI> and &s;ays, "This Day is publi&s;hed"&mdash;I my&s;elf was one that was chiefly con|cern'd in publi&s;hing of it&mdash;I &s;ent the fir&s;t Copy to <HI>Scot|land,</HI> and to my certain Knowledge it was never pub|li&s;hed in <HI>Britain</HI> 'till <HI>May</HI> 1&s;t.&mdash;Is it probable that Peo|ple
<PB N="5" REF="005313_0004_10181B880E1C78F8">
at <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> &s;hould know of this <HI>May</HI> 24?&mdash;What a Character this Gentleman has always had for "&s;ound Under&s;tanding, Integrity, Sobriety of Manners and Piety," I will not take upon me to determine; nor does the Publi&s;her give us Opportunity to know what Cha|racter the Gentleman really has had, &s;ince he does not publi&s;h his Name: But however that be, I fear he has forfeited his good Character "for found Under&s;tanding, Integrity and Piety," by writing this Letter. And tho' he may not be altogether an "unconcern'd Spectator of any Thing that might affect Religion," yet, I fear he has been &s;o taken up with <HI>his Engagements in &s;ecular Affairs,</HI> that he hath not given him&s;elf &s;ufficient Time to enquire into Matters of Fact, has heard with others Ears, and &s;een with others Eyes, and has not him&s;elf attended as he ought, <HI>to the one Thing needful.</HI></P>
<P>He &s;ays in the Beginning of his Letter, Page the 3d, <Q>I am &s;orry you have had &s;uch Accounts of Per&s;ons, and Things tran&s;mitted you from this Country, as you mention in your Letter; they are far from being true, &amp; mu&s;t come from Men of narrow Minds, and great Bigotry, or from &s;uch as ba&s;ely affect Populari|ty, or well-meaning weak Chri&s;tians, of little Know|ledge of human Nature, or the Hi&s;tory of Mankind.</Q> What Accounts this Gentleman refers to I know not&mdash;If he means the Accounts in the <HI>Weekly Hi&s;tory,</HI> as I &s;uppo&s;e he does; I think this Gentleman is &s;adly mi&s;ta|ken. Mo&s;t of the Accounts were tran&s;mitted by the Honourable Mr. <HI>Willard,</HI> Secretary of the Province&mdash;The Rev. Dr. <HI>Colman</HI>&mdash;The Rev. Mr. <HI>Prince</HI>&mdash;The Rev. Mr. <HI>Cooper:</HI> Per&s;ons I am intimately acquainted with, and who are by no Means <Q>Men of narrow Minds, great Bigotry, or little Knowledge of hu|man Nature, or the Hi&s;tory of Mankind: But have
<PB N="6" REF="005313_0005_10181B8B0A6C8888">
<HI>de&s;ervedly</HI> had a good Character for &s;ound Under|&s;tanding, Integrity, Sobriety of Manners &amp; Piety.</Q></P>
<P>Now whether they, or this <HI>anonymous</HI> Writer are to be credited mo&s;t, I leave any rea&s;onable Man to judge. Indeed he boldly a&s;&s;erts, That the&s;e Accounts <HI>are not true:</HI> But what Proofs does he bring of the Fal&s;ity of them? None at all&mdash;Let us but know who this Writer is, I am per&s;waded my honoured Friends at <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> will &s;oon bring him to the Te&s;t of the&s;e A&s;&s;ertions.</P>
<P>He goes on thus, <Q>Indeed, <HI>&s;ays</HI> he, &s;ome Per&s;ons of very good Sen&s;e were once inclined to think GOD was doing Wonders in this Place</Q> <HI>viz. Bo&s;ton</HI>&mdash;And I am per&s;waded the&s;e very &s;ame Per&s;ons have not alter'd their Opinion yet, but actually believe that GOD has done Wonders, if turning People from Darkne&s;s to Light, and making them new Creatures, is doing Wonders.</P>
<P><Q>But that was a Time when a &s;uper&s;titious Pannick run very high, and bore down every Body, that was not well fix'd and e&s;tabli&s;h'd; either by a natural Steddine&s;s of Temper, or by &s;trong Rea&s;oning and Reflections&mdash;But as &s;oon as the Pa&s;&s;ions of the Peo|ple &s;ub&s;ided, and Men could cooly and calmly con|&s;ider, almo&s;t every one of but tolerable Sen&s;e &amp; Un|der&s;tanding in religious Matters, in great Mea&s;ure changed their Opinions of the Spirit that prevailed here, and had been rai&s;ed by <HI>Whitefield</HI> and <HI>Tennent.</HI></Q></P>
<P>What! Had been rai&s;ed by <HI>Whitefield</HI> and <HI>Tennent!</HI> GOD forbid that either Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI> or <HI>I</HI> &s;hould a&s;cribe any of that Work to our&s;elves.&mdash;No, it was rai&s;ed by the <HI>Holy Spirit of God</HI>&mdash;It was no <HI>&s;uper&s;titious Pannick,</HI> but a plentiful Effu&s;ion of the Holy Gho&s;t. It's true, <HI>it did run high;</HI> Glory be to GOD for it! and did bear down every Body, except tho&s;e who would not &s;ubmit
<PB N="7" REF="005313_0006_10181B8E94EA2040">
to the Redeemer's Scepter, through Self-righteou&s;ne&s;s and Unbelief; which I am afraid this Writer terms, Natural Steddine&s;s of Temper, &s;trong Rea&s;oning and Reflection. <Q>Nor is it true that almo&s;t every one of but tolerable Under&s;tanding in religious Matters, in a great Mea&s;ure have changed their Opinions of the Spirit that prevail'd at that Time.</Q> No, dear Sir, They yet believe it to be a glorious Work of GOD, as is evident from the late Writings of &s;ome of the&s;e emi|nent Mini&s;ters in <HI>New-England,</HI> mention'd in the Title-Page of the Pamphlet.</P>
<P>What the Writer &s;ays of me in the following Para|graph, p. 4<HI>th,</HI> is not worthy Notice. He is welcome to make as free with my Character as he plea&s;es, and I freely forgive him&mdash;However I thank him for doing me the Ju&s;tice to &s;ay, "That I collected Money for the <HI>Orphan Hou&s;e in Georgia</HI>&mdash;It was not then for <HI>my&s;elf:</HI> Nor does he charge me with embezzling the 5 or 600l. He could not do this <HI>ju&s;tly,</HI> becau&s;e before the writing of this Letter an Account came to <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> how I had ex|pended it. And as for being "a bold and importunate Beggar", I acknowledge that I learn'd that from the wi&s;e Man who tells me, <HI>Whatever thou finde&s;t in thy Hand to do, do it with all thy Might;</HI> and from the Apo|&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> who in the &s;econd Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> Chap. viii. 9. &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ws him&s;elf to be the mo&s;t bold, in&s;inu|ating and importunate Beggar for pious U&s;es that I ever yet met with.</P>
<P>I think I am much oblig'd to the Writer for what he &s;ays concerning <HI>me</HI> in this Re&s;pect. But I wi&s;h he had not made &s;o free with the Character of my honoured Friends. He cries out again&s;t Slander in others, at the &s;ame Time thro' the whole Letter, he is guilty of the mo&s;t palpable Slander him&s;elf&mdash;He is pretty favourable
<PB N="8" REF="005313_0007_10181B9226D5A680">
to the Rev. Mr. <HI>Webb,</HI> and the Rev. Mr. <HI>Cooper</HI> of <HI>Bo&s;ton.</HI> He only calls them, p. 7<HI>th,</HI> "Two great Ad|mirers of <HI>Whitefield</HI> and <HI>Tennent,</HI> flaming Zealots, for certain <HI>favourite</HI> Opinions and Tenets."&mdash;And &s;o indeed they are ble&s;&s;ed Champions, I know them well, for cer|tain <HI>favourite</HI> Opinions, and Tenets of the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI>&mdash;Such as Original Sin, imputed Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, Election, and other glorious Go&s;pel Truths. But as for Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI> he &s;eems quite angry with him.</P>
<P>Never was a Man more wrongfully repre&s;ented. This Letter-writer &s;ays, "He has often heard that Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI> had always been remarkable in the <HI>Jer&s;eys,</HI> for his Uncharitable and divi&s;ive Cour&s;es," But does the hearing of this prove the Truth of it? I have the Hap|pine&s;s of being per&s;onally &amp; very intimately acquainted with Mr. <HI>Tennent.</HI> I &s;carce know a Man of a more catholick Spirit. "He is a Man of no Learning." His Writings prove the contrary. His Antagoni&s;ts abroad dare not &s;ay they have found it &s;o. <Q>His great Bu&s;ine&s;s in his Sermons is either to puzzle, or to fright the Hearers, but e&s;pecially the la&s;t, which he did by roaring out, and bellowing <HI>Hell</HI> and <HI>Damna|tion, Devils,</HI> and all the <HI>dreadful Words</HI> he could think of.</Q> Indeed, to the Honour of the Grace of GOD be it &s;poken, he is a Son of Thunder, e&s;pecially in his Application, and when <HI>he is preaching the Law;</HI> at &s;uch Times, under him, People cannot ea&s;ily &s;leep: But with<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> he is a Workman that needs not be a&s;hamed, and is taught of <HI>God rightly to divide the Word of Truth.</HI> As for puzzling his Hearers, I fear that Mr. <HI>A. M.</HI> thinks he did &s;o, <HI>becau&s;e</HI> he generally in&s;i&s;ts much on the New-Birth, Imputed Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Divine Faith, and the other peculiar Doctrines of the Go&s;pel. The&s;e Things are all Fooli&s;hne&s;s to the natural Man, and puzzled

<HI>Nicodemus</HI> him&s;elf, when di&s;cour&s;ed of by our ble&s;&s;ed Lord. <HI>John</HI> iii. 9. <HI>Nicodemus an&s;wered and &s;aid unto him, How can the&s;e Things be?</HI> <Q>Mini&s;ters in general, he calls Carnal, Unconverted, Blind-leaders of the Blind, Rational, Moral, Dry, Hu&s;ky Preachers, that were leading the People to Hell.</Q> I &s;uppo&s;e Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI> &s;aid, That carnal blind Preachers who preach Morality, without due Regard to Go&s;pel Grace and Motives; who do not preach Ju&s;tification by Faith, Regeneration, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they who do not preach Chri&s;t as All in All, <HI>were Blind-leaders of the Blind,</HI> and were leading the People to Hell. But it is ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e he thought that all Mini&s;ters in general were &s;uch. I know a great Body of Mini&s;ters, that he thinks mo&s;t highly of. But, <Q>he exhorted People to leave them, to go about exhorting one another, and telling their Experiences.</Q> This I cannot believe is truly re|pre&s;ented; for I have now a Letter by me publi&s;hed by Mr. <HI>Tennent,</HI> again&s;t Per&s;ons going about in the Cha|racter of Exhorters. But if he only exhorted Chri&s;ti|ans not to for &s;ake the a&s;&s;embling of them&s;elves together, to provoke one another to Love, and good Works, and to tell one another what GOD had done for their Souls, he did no more than what every Go&s;pel Mini&s;ter &s;hould do. He &s;ays, "He was followed by all &s;orts of Peo|ple." This I think was a Proof that he was of a catho|lick Spirit, and not of a divi&s;ive uncharitable Temper. "As much as <HI>Whitefield</HI> was"&mdash;<Q>And I pray GOD he may be followed a thou&s;and Times more! And by many preferred to him&mdash;Very ju&s;tly&mdash;"He was mo&s;t Cen&s;orious and Uncharitable, every one that was not exactly of his Mind he damn'd without Mercy.</Q>&mdash;This is Calumny indeed.&mdash;I know many Mini&s;ters who do not think as Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI> does in all

Re&s;pects whom he notwith&s;tanding highly values. But <HI>I</HI> &s;uppo&s;e the Writer was angry with him, becau&s;e he pronounced all damn'd that were not born again, and that did not believe in, and lay hold on the imputed Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.&mdash;His Ma&s;ter authorizes him to pronounce &s;uch damn'd&mdash;<HI>He that believeth not &s;hall be damn'd.</HI>&mdash;<Q>His Sermons were <HI>&s;ometimes</HI> as con|fu&s;ed and &s;en&s;ele&s;s as you can imagine</Q>&mdash;It is well they were not always &s;o. <Q>He &s;eem'd to have a par|ticular Quarrel with Rea&s;on, Learning and Morali|ty; for he &s;eldom fini&s;hed a Sermon without &s;aying &s;omething again&s;t them</Q>&mdash;Never I believe, but when the&s;e Things are magnified to the Prejudice of divine Revelation, Illumination, or Chri&s;t's imputed Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s&mdash;For Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI> is a &s;olid, learned, rational, and not only a moral but truly holy Man. The Rev. Doctor <HI>Colman</HI> in a Letter to me, publi&s;hed in the fir&s;t Weekly Paper printed at <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> writes thus of him&mdash;<Q>We received him ju&s;t as we did you, as an Angel of Chri&s;t&mdash;He was abundant and fervent in Labours, and GOD has been plea&s;ed to own his Labours with abundant Succe&s;s</Q>&mdash;The honourable, and truly pious Secretary <HI>Willard,</HI> writes thus, <Q>There has been &s;o evidently the Finger of GOD in directing you into this Province, and (after your Departure) the Rev. Mr. <HI>Tennent,</HI> through your earne&s;t and importunate Reque&s;t to him, and in the wonderful Succe&s;s that has attended both his and your Mini&s;try; as al&s;o the Labours of our own Mini&s;ters for &s;ome Months pa&s;t, that many that like not the Work are &s;adly put to it, to keep their Eyes &s;hut again&s;t the Evi|dences of it.</Q></P>
<P>The Rev. Mr. <HI>Cooper</HI> in a Letter printed in the <HI>Weekly Hi&s;tory</HI> No. 2d, which the Printer has mi&s;taken
<PB N="11" REF="005313_0010_10180E4498BCAFF8">
for <HI>Colman,</HI> calls him, "Dear Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI>&mdash;He came" &s;ays he, <Q>In the Fullne&s;s of the Ble&s;&s;ing of the Go&s;pel indeed. He was with us &s;everal Months. Many Thou&s;ands were awakened, and I believe many truly converted. There is quite another Face of Religion in this Town, as well as in many Places in the Coun|try. Many Mini&s;ters as well as People greatly quickened. Ble&s;&s;ed be God who put it into your Heart to move him to come, and inclined his Heart to come, and help us.</Q> I could bring a Cloud of Witne&s;&s;es to te&s;tify the Fal&s;ene&s;s of the Character giv|en Mr. <HI>Gilbert Tennent</HI> by this Letter-Writer: The Account which he gives of him&s;elf to me in a Letter publi&s;hed in the <HI>Weekly Hi&s;tory</HI> No. is admirably &s;weet. His Book intitled the Pre&s;umptous Sinner detected, and his many printed Sermons, and his Preface to his de|cea&s;ed Brother's Treati&s;e upon the New-Birth, which is now in the Country, which I wou'd recommend, &s;hew him to be a Man of great Learning, Solidity and Piety. And I am not without &s;ome di&s;tant Hopes that, the People of <HI>Scotland</HI> will have an Opportunity of hear|ing him ere long, and then they may judge for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>After &s;uch a fal&s;e and &s;candalous Character given of that great Man of God Mr. <HI>Gilbert Tennent,</HI> I think I may ju&s;tly &s;u&s;pect the Truth of all that this Writer &s;ays in the &s;ub&s;equent Part of the Letter. From &s;uch a Letter-Writer as this, What Truth can we expect?</P>
<P>The Writer him&s;elf gives me Leave to &s;peak in this Manner&mdash;For he &s;eems to make the Validity of what follows to depend on the Character he gave of me and Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI> p. the 6<HI>th,</HI> <Q>From &s;uch Men as the&s;e (<HI>Whitefield</HI> and <HI>Tennent</HI>) and &s;uch Doctrines and Ways of Preaching as theirs, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> What Fruit can you expect?</Q> Now all he &s;ays about me is,

<Q>That I collected in <HI>New-England</HI> 5 or 600 <HI>&pound;.

And as for the Character he gives of Mr. <HI>Tennent,</HI> I have proved it to be ab&s;olutely Fal&s;e: Con&s;equently whatever he builds upon the Foun|dation of Mr. <HI>Tennent'</HI>s bad Character, amounts to no|thing at all, &s;ince he has not proved the Character given of him to be true.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI> was the Man he is repre&s;en|ted to be; Does it therefore follow that all the great and glorious Work carried on in <HI>New-England,</HI> by other Mini&s;ters, and in other Places where Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI> and I never were, is <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m</HI> and <HI>Delu&s;ion?</HI> By no Means; and yet this is the whole Drift of the Pamphlet.</P>
<P>Surely the Writer knows not what Spirit he is of: In the 6, 7, 8, 9<HI>th</HI> and 10<HI>th</HI> Pages, he repre&s;ents Things in a mo&s;t ridiculous Dre&s;s, and takes upon him to con|demn all the Converts to a Man, tho' he could not po&s;&s;ibly be acquainted with the hundredth Part of them, as <Q>Self-conceited, &s;uper&s;titious, enthu&s;ia&s;tick, cen|&s;orious, Slanderers.</Q> At the &s;ame Time he &s;eems to ridicule the Concern the People were under when they were brought to cry out, <HI>What &s;hall we do to be &s;aved</HI>". He laughs at them for a&s;king one another <Q>How do you feel? Have you &s;een Chri&s;t? <HI>He boldly a&s;&s;erts</HI> that the boa&s;ted Converts, not one in a Hundred ex|cepted, make Religion con&s;i&s;t, in the Feeling of in|ward Impul&s;es, Impre&s;&s;ions, and in an inexplicable Faith, Joys, Extacys, hearing of Sermons, and &s;uch like.</Q> In &s;hort he by this and the whole Drift of his Letter, &s;eems to me to be far from de&s;erving the Cha|racter given him in the Adverti&s;ement affixed to the Title-Page of the Pamphlet.</P>

And I have great Rea&s;on to believe that he is a Man not over credulous: Becau&s;e I have heard from his Friends here, that he did not overmuch favour the Work of God that was at <HI>Northampton</HI> in <HI>New-England</HI> &s;ome Years ago, and therefore probably would not readily favour the late Work in <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> and other Parts, had he not &s;ufficient Evidence that it was a Work of God.</P>
<P><HI>Page</HI> 14<HI>th,</HI> The Letter-Writer takes upon him to a&s;&s;ert that a Pamphlet publi&s;h'd in <HI>Scotland</HI> intitled, <HI>Chri&s;t's riding</HI> in the <HI>Chariot of Salvation,</HI> is &s;tuffed with abominable Lies. As a Proof of it, he urges That the Students in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> got nothing by <HI>White|field</HI> and <HI>Tennent</HI> but <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m,</HI> Pride, a Contempt of their Betters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> What they got by me I know not, but I have great Rea&s;on to believe they got &s;omething that was good, under God, by Mr. <HI>Tennent.</HI> For Dr. <HI>Colman</HI> in a Letter to me which was printed in the <HI>Gla&s;gow Weekly Hi&s;tory</HI> No. 1<HI>&s;t,</HI> writes, <Q>At <HI>Cam|bridge</HI> the College is a new Creature; the Students full of God, and like to come out Ble&s;&s;ings in their Generations, and to be &s;o now to each other. Many of them are now we think truly born again, and &s;everal of them happy In&s;truments of Conver&s;ion to their Fellows. The Voice of Prayer and Prai&s;e fills their Chambers; and the Sincerity, Fervency, and Joy, with Seriou&s;ne&s;s of their Heart, &s;its vi&s;ibly on their Faces. I was told Ye&s;terday that not &s;even of

a Hundred remain unaffected. I know how the good Tidings of this will affect and plea&s;e you. God give you like Joy every where in the Fruit of your Labours.</Q></P>
<P>And the honourable Secretary <HI>Willard</HI> about the &s;ame Time writes to me thus: <Q>But that which forebodes a more la&s;ting Advantage, is the new Face of Things at the College, where the Impre&s;&s;ions of Religion have been, and &s;till are very general, and many in a Judgment of Charity brought home to Chri&s;t; and divers Gentlemen's Sons, that were &s;ent there only for a more polite Education, are now &s;o full of Zeal for the Cau&s;e of Chri&s;t, and of Love to Souls, as to devote them&s;elves entirely to the Studies of Divinity.</Q></P>
<P>The &s;ame Page he would fain tax Mr. <HI>Gilbert Tennent</HI> with a Lie; for it was he wrote the Account in the <HI>Weekly Hi&s;tory</HI> No. 1<HI>&s;t.</HI> In the above-mentioned Pamphlet, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> <Q>It is &s;aid, When Mr. <HI>Gilbert Ten|nent</HI> preached at <HI>Marblehead</HI> and <HI>Charle&s;town,</HI> his Voice had like to have been drown'd with their Out|cries.</Q> But he mi&s;takes: It is not &s;aid &s;o: For I have &s;earch'd narrowly into the <HI>Pamphlet</HI> and <HI>Weekly Hi&s;tory,</HI> and find no Mention of an Outcry but only a great Shock given at <HI>Marblehead.</HI> It was at <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> where Mr. <HI>Gilbert Tennent</HI> writing to his Brother &s;ays, <Q>That there were, <HI>viz.</HI> at <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> &amp; <HI>Charle&s;town,</HI> in Time of Sermon &s;uch Outcries that his Voice had like to have been drown'd.</Q> I think Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI> is the be&s;t Judge of what he heard with his own Ears. Mr. <HI>A. M.</HI>'s living near <HI>Charle&s;town,</HI> and having never heard a Word of this from the Mini&s;ter with whom he frequently conver&s;ed, is no Proof it was not &s;o.

In the &s;ame Page he finds Fault with the Accounts given of &s;ome young Children <Q>who talked of the Things of GOD as if they were People of 70 or 80 Years.

<P>But why &s;hould I &s;ay more? It would be endle&s;s, as well as take up too much of my precious Time, to be more particular in my Ob&s;ervations upon Mr. <HI>A. M.'</HI>s Letter. There are &s;ome Matters of Fact mentioned in it, &s;uch as "a blind Lad's preaching in <HI>Connecti|cut,</HI> p. 12. Mr. <HI>D</HI>&mdash;'s Manner of Preaching in a hot Day, p. 13," and &s;ome other Things which I cannot take upon me to make Replies to, and which if true, will by no Means prove the late Work of God in <HI>New-England</HI> to be only <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m</HI> and <HI>Delu&s;ion.</HI> Ere long I hope to &s;ee <HI>Bo&s;ton.</HI> Then I will endeavour to &s;end an impartial Account.

<P>In the mean while give me leave to ob&s;erve, that the Publi&s;hers of this Pamphlet (for I believe there are more than one concern'd in it) have almo&s;t &s;aved me the Trouble, and have taken an effectual Way to confute them&s;elves. For they have annex'd to this Letter an <Q>Appendix containing Proofs for the Facts in the foregoing Letter, extracted from Sermons preached by &s;ome of the mo&s;t eminent Mini&s;ters in <HI>New-England,</HI> lately printed at <HI>Bo&s;ton.</HI></Q> But the&s;e Ex|tracts by no Means contain Proofs of the Facts recorded in the foregoing Letter, con&s;equently all the Facts in
<PB N="17" REF="005313_0016_10181ABDBB5525E0">
the foregoing Letter which are not proved by the&s;e Extracts, we have Rea&s;on to doubt of. I have not an Opportunity of getting all the Sermons of the Rev. Mi|ni&s;ters mentioned in the Title-Page: But it grieved me when I &s;aw Extracts taken out of their Writings, to prove that the Work lately begun and carried on in <HI>New-England</HI> was <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m</HI> and <HI>Delu&s;ion.</HI> This was the chief Rea&s;on of my writing you this Letter. It will grieve them to hear that their Writings have been u&s;ed to &s;o bad a Purpo&s;e. The Compilers of the Pamphlet have deal with their Sermons, as the Devil dealt with the Scripture when he tempted our Lord in the Wilderne&s;s, I mean marred and wholly mi&s;applied them. The Publi&s;hers &s;tile them at the Head of the Appendix, &s;ome of the mo&s;t eminent Mini&s;ters in <HI>New-England.</HI> They depend much upon their Authority, to prove the Facts of Mr. <HI>A. M.'</HI>s Letter. And I de&s;ire no other Authority than the&s;e very eminent Mini&s;ters Sermons out of which the Extracts are taken, to prove that the Work lately begun and carried on in <HI>New-England</HI> is not <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m</HI> and <HI>Delu&s;ion,</HI> but a great and marvellous Work of the Spirit of God.</P>
<P>The Compilers indeed in order to make the World believe they had been impartial, have publi&s;h'd a Sen|tence or two wherein Dr. <HI>Colman</HI> has written favour|ably of the <HI>Orphan-Hou&s;e</HI> in <HI>Georgia,</HI> and &s;ays <Q>the Order of it is admirable, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> but this is only a Di&s;|gui&s;e. For they have been far from acting fair in this Re&s;pect. The Doctor complains in the <HI>P. S.</HI> of that Letter, p. 44. <Q>That &s;ome of my Friends have made too free with my Letters in printing only Part of them, and mixing them with Part of others with|out Di&s;tinction.</Q> I think it is my Duty to take all the Blame from off my Friends as to printing only Parts
<PB N="18" REF="005313_0017_10181AC0D4CFCA10">
of his Letters, upon my &s;elf; for I was the only Per|&s;on concern'd: But as for mixing them with others without Di&s;tinction, I know nothing of it. The Let|ters were &s;ent to me from the Doctor. I thought it would be improper to publi&s;h any other Parts of the Doctor's Letters than what re&s;pected the Succe&s;s of the glorious Go&s;pel, and that I thought he would gladly have publi&s;hed: But if the Doctor found Fault with my Friends, I am &s;ure he ju&s;tly may blame the&s;e Compi|lers who have publi&s;hed only Part of this Letter of his. One would have thought they &s;hould have taken a Cau|tion from this very <HI>P. S.</HI> But they were afraid as it would &s;eem, of the Contents of it; for a Friend who has &s;een and read the whole Letter &s;ends me the follow|ing Extract out of it. <Q>I hope we are retrenching our Superfluities and Luxury; our young People have thrown by much of their Finery and Gaiety, and &s;eem to have Eye and Heart on Things &s;piritual and heavenly; and if God build them up into Fa|milies with their pre&s;ent prudent pious Di&s;po&s;itions, it promi&s;es greatly for the next Generation; <HI>That Glory will dwell in our Land, and his Work appear to Children's Children.</HI></Q> And in that very Part of it they have printed, the Doctor &s;ays enough to overthrow the whole De&s;ign of the Pamphlet. <Q>All this, P. 42, notwith&s;tanding, there has been a great and glorious Work of God going on among us, from the Day of Mr. <HI>Whitefield'</HI>s Vi&s;it to us.</Q> I have a Sermon of the Doctor's now before me intitled, <Q><HI>The Word of God magnified by him,</HI> preached <HI>April</HI> 29. 1742, wherein his Te&s;timony is humbly given for the great and wondrous Work of GOD's Grace manife&s;t in many Parts of the Land.</Q> The la&s;t <HI>Paragraph</HI> of that Sermon begins thus, <Q>I clo&s;e with giving Glory
<PB N="19" REF="005313_0018_10181AC5E853DA40">
to GOD for the great and good Work of his Grace which he hath &s;o vi&s;ibly begun, &s;pread, and is carry|ing on in every Part almo&s;t of our Provinces.</Q> This very Sermon I believe has been in the Hands of the Compilers of this Pamphlet. How then could they be &s;o bare-fac'd, and &s;o injurious, to the good Man's Character, as to print any Part of his Letter, to &s;ub&s;erve &s;o ba&s;e a De&s;ign? I believe they will not have the Doctor's Thanks for this.</P>
<P>The like Treatment they have given the Revd. Mr. <HI>Turell,</HI> another of the eminent Mini&s;ters from whom they have taken Extracts to prove the Facts of Mr. <HI>A. M.'</HI>s Letter. I am per&s;uaded Mr. <HI>Turell</HI> will be much concern'd to find any Part of his Sermon thus mi&s;u&s;ed; and how the Compilers of this Pamphlet could dare to make this U&s;e of his Writing I cannot imagine; for, in the very fir&s;t Page of the <HI>Preface</HI> to that very Sermon out of which they have taken their Extracts, he &s;peaks of him&s;elf <Q>as one of the Friends and zea|lous Promoters of the good Work</Q>: Nay he begins his Preface with the&s;e Words, <Q>The Occa&s;ion of my publi&s;hing this brief Direction to my People, is partly to vindicate my Character which has been in|jured by a Report &s;pread, that of a zealous Promo|ter of the glorious Work of GOD's Grace and Spirit appearing, I am become an Oppo&s;er</Q>: Which &s;hews that Mr. <HI>Turell</HI> would not care to be repre&s;ented as an Oppo&s;er of that Work, and con&s;equently would not chu&s;e that his Writings &s;hould be produced to prove the principal Facts in this Letter of <HI>A. M.'</HI>s, who would repre&s;ent the whole as <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m</HI> and <HI>Delu&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>What Opinion Mr. <HI>Turell</HI> had of Per&s;ons of this Gentleman's Spirit is evident from the 4th <HI>Page</HI> of the &s;ame <HI>Preface,</HI> which the Compilers of the Pamphlet
<PB N="20" REF="005313_0019_10181AC77B4310F8">
could not but &s;ee. His Words are the&s;e, <Q>As for the profane Triumphs of the Oppo&s;ers; (of &s;uch I mean) who attribute the Whole of this glorious Scene to the Devil, or wild <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m,</HI> a <HI>heated</HI> Ima|gination, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I dete&s;t their Opinion, tho' I am far from judging their State. I am confident that of the many that I have di&s;cour&s;ed with under the <HI>com|mon</HI> Impre&s;&s;ions (two or three excepted) they have been all wrought upon in a Way agreeable to the Go&s;pel: And ju&s;t as I &s;hould have de&s;ir'd &s;ome Years ago. And I mu&s;t te&s;tify to the Glory of GOD and his &s;overeign rich Grace, that I do behold the di&s;|tingui&s;hing Marks of GOD's Spirit on many: My Brethren, let us pray for the Pre&s;ervation, Revival, Progre&s;s, and univer&s;al Spread thereof.</Q> In p. 14<HI>th</HI> of his Directions, <HI>he &s;ays,</HI> <Q>I charitably believe &s;ome Scores in this Place have been &s;eriou&s;ly wrought up|on; and the far greater Part of them have declared, God has made me the happy In&s;trument of their Awakening. And P. 18<HI>th,</HI> &s;ays he, The Names of <HI>Whitefield</HI> and <HI>Tennent</HI> (tho' liable to err) I have once and again mention'd to you with Honour; they have been rai&s;ed by God to do abundance of Good.</Q> How does this agree with the Account Mr. <HI>A. M.</HI> gives of the Spirit rai&s;ed by us, and with that &s;candalous Character he gives of Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI> in particular: And when the&s;e Quotations are Parts of one of the Treati&s;es out of which one of the Extracts mentioned in the <HI>Appendix</HI> is taken, and are written by one of tho&s;e eminent Mini&s;ters who&s;e Writings are re|ferred to, to prove the principal Facts recorded in Mr. <HI>A. M.'</HI>s Letter.</P>
<P>But what &s;urprizes me mo&s;t of all is, That they &s;hould extract any Thing from Mr. <HI>Par&s;ons</HI> to prove

Mr. <HI>A. M.</HI>'s Matters of Fact.

Mr. <HI>Par&s;ons'</HI>s Caution to others again&s;t concluding too ra&s;hly that People are converted, is a Pre&s;umption that he is cauti|ous in that Matter him&s;elf; yet in this very Sermon of Mr. <HI>Par&s;ons,</HI> out of which the Extract mention'd in the Appendix is taken, He &s;ays <HI>Page</HI> the 44<HI>th,</HI> <Q>I hope not le&s;s than an hundred and fifty Souls are converted in about nine Months pa&s;t</Q>: Tho' his Pari&s;h is &s;mall, con&s;i&s;ting only of 120 Families.

This, dear Sir, is nothing but what is common. It was &s;o in <HI>Old-England</HI> &s;ome few Years ago. Many young Per&s;ons there ran out before they were called.

I charge and admoni&s;h you by the <HI>Dignity</HI> and <HI>Worth</HI> of your immortal Souls; by the powerful Impre&s;&s;i|ons of an approaching Change; by the certain tre|mendous <HI>appearing</HI> of the great Judge&punc; by the inexpre&s;&s;ible Agonies of Hell, and in conceiveable Joys of an everla&s;ting Heaven, that you do no longer re|ject, nor once more cavil again&s;t the glorious Intere&s;t and Kingdom of the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us <HI>triumphing</HI> at this Day, and <HI>inviting</HI> the mi&s;erable Slaves of the Devil, to become the happy Subjects of it. I warn and charge you before the great God, and the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and the Holy Angels, <HI>upon your Peril,</HI> that you take diligent Heed to the&s;e Things. And if you reject to hear, if you <HI>dare</HI> reject or boldly de&s;pi&s;e the Admonition, remember you are an&s;werable at the great Tribunal, and mu&s;t expect <HI>a mo&s;t fearful</HI> Share of Torments among the damn'd World, for &s;uch un&s;peakable Guilt.</Q></P>
<P>Thus &s;peaks this worthy Man: My Heart warm'd, dear Sir, whil&s;t I was reading his Di&s;cour&s;e; 'tis clo&s;e, &s;uccinct and powerful: How could the Publi&s;hers after reading &s;uch a dreadful Warning, print any Thing out of his Sermon, to prove the Work in <HI>New-England Enthu&s;ia&s;m?</HI> I would heartily join with him and the

other Mini&s;ters in <HI>New-England,</HI> was I there, in bear|ing a faithful Te&s;timony again&s;t any Thing that I might judge to be incon&s;i&s;tent with the precious Rules of the holy Scriptures. At the &s;ame Time, I pray that even the Mini&s;ters them&s;elves may act with the &s;ame Caution they <HI>recommend</HI> to their People, and then I doubt not but we &s;hall &s;ee a happy End put to what may now be irregular or di&s;orderly. The dear Redeemer has a&s;&s;ured us, that the Gates of Hell &s;hall never prevail again&s;t his Church. He will cau&s;e that all Things &s;hall work together for her Good. The Wrath of Man &s;hall turn to his Prai&s;e, and the Remainder of it &s;hall he re|&s;train. He will bring Order out of Confu&s;ion, and the Church &s;hall be more than Conqueror thro' his Love. I will therefore conclude this long Letter with the Words of the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> in the &s;econd <HI>P&s;alm.</HI></P>

<P>And as there is a remarkable <HI>Uniformity</HI> in the Work of GOD, as it has appeared there and in <HI>this Country;</HI> &s;o this Performance is excellently &s;uited to vindicate it from many of the Objections made again&s;t it among&s;t <HI>Us;</HI> and is wrote in &s;o &s;criptural and rational, &s;o ma&s;terly and polite a Manner, that it is not doubted but it will be read with Approbation by the Judicious and Unprejudiced.</P>
