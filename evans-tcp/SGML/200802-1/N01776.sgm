<HEAD>The Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed State of BOSTON Further Con&s;idered.</HEAD>
<P>SInce the Publi&s;hing of my Letter, Entitu|led, <HI>The Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed State of the Town of</HI> B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ton: Several pretended An&s;wers have been Pub|li&s;hed, with De&s;ign to amu&s;e the Coun|try, by in&s;inuating, that the State of the Town is not as I have Repre&s;ented it; and that I have a&s;&s;igned wrong Cau&s;es for our Di&s;tre&s;&s;es. But it is a vain thing to endeavour to per&s;wade People contrary to what they daily Experience; Had the Gentleman who hath given him&s;elf the trouble to make An&s;wer, projected &s;omething for a <HI>Medium of Exchange,</HI> to pa&s;s among us, which is the only way to Extricate us out of our Difficulties; he would have merited well of his Country; but to fault what others do, and propo&s;e nothing, (<HI>&s;ave the empty notions of leaving off Tru&s;ting, and allowing Intere&s;t on Book Debts</HI>; Things impracticable at any time, but more e&s;pecially in our pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances) &s;eems to me much below the Character of him, who is accounted the Author; the Writer doubt|le&s;s thinks he hath done wonderful things in his An&s;wer, but I believe I &s;hall &s;oon make it evident, that he hath not in the lea&s;t an&s;wered my Letter; and demon&s;trate, he talks very ignorantly, and like
<PB N="2" REF="002106_0003_0fbb81e0e3cd4498">
a man utterly unacquainted with Trade, AND THE STATE of HIS COUNTRY ALSO.</P>
<P>He owns him&s;elf <HI>&s;o &s;hort of a common Under&s;tanding, that after <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> careful R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">iew of my Letter, he cannot find the Important Matters he hath omitted an&s;wering</HI>; I am &s;orry to find him &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">il of Apprehen&s;ion, that he cannot &s;ee the Evils I complain of, and the Reme|dy I drive it; What Propo&s;al hath he made, to &s;upply us with a <HI>Medium of Exchange?</HI> Without which, it is impo&s;&s;ible this Town or Country can Sub&s;i&s;t; What Method hath he thought on, to pre|vent the va&s;t number of Law-Suits? Which it is a Scandal to the Land to name. Hath he Project|ed any way to bring in Silver, as the Paper-Bills &s;ink! or hath he Contrived how to keep what doth Come in, from being Ship'd off again; Hath he &s;hewn us the Art of Living without a <HI>Medi|um!</HI> Hath he found a way to prevent Mercinary Men's Oppre&s;&s;ing their Neighbours, by anticipating, as well as exacting Intere&s;t, or by taking their Lands at half Value! Hath he Contrived, how tho&s;e who Live on their Salaries, &s;hall be paid without Money! But bove all, What Contrivance hath he found, to &s;up|port this poor Town the hard Winter approach|ing? Can they Sub&s;i&s;t from day to day, without the Ready Peny! The&s;e I think to be Matters of Importance, and what any man might have &s;een to be my De&s;ign in Writing that Letter; but he hath pa&s;&s;ed them over in Silence, being &s;o intent I pre|&s;ume, on &s;inking the few Bills which are yet abroad, and thereby compleating the Ruin of the Land: (to gratifie the ambition of a few) That he could not &s;ee the&s;e Things. THOUGH OF THE LAST CONSEQUENCE TO US.</P>
<P>And that I may not be Charged with being Un|charitable, <HI>I &s;hall next con&s;ider his Propo&s;al of Leaving off Tru&s;ting, and allowing Intere&s;t on Book Debts,</HI> which is
<PB N="3" REF="002106_0004_0fbb81e236f5bf78">
the only Remedy he propo&s;es to Extricate us out of our Difficulties; the Propo&s;al is &s;o contrary to the Spirit of Chri&s;tianity, that it fills me with Horror when I think of it. For I find poor People mu&s;t have neither Money nor Credit, it this Charitable Man might have his Will, unle&s;s on the harde&s;t Terms he could invent. Indeed, the Gentleman will allow, <HI>They &s;hall be Tru&s;ted S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">x Months (provided they will from that time be content to allow</HI> Ten per Cent. <HI>Inte|re&s;t</HI>; When he knows, that in the Method we are in, there will not be in (<HI>&s;even years at mo&s;t</HI>) a Bill Abroad, to Pay either Principal or Intere&s;t; The Law hath wi&s;ely limited Intere&s;t to <HI>Six per Cent.</HI> but that will not content him; he would be thought wi&s;er than the Law, and therefore is for <HI>Ten per Cent.</HI> Truly his Brain &s;eems to be addled with the&s;e No|tions, that he forgets the Scriptures, though (if I am not out in my gue&s;s) his Profe&s;&s;ion is to Study them; I would advi&s;e him to Con&s;ult the Divine Oracles, and &s;ee whether U&s;ury is &s;o much encoura|ged there; and until he hath proved by Scripture, that <HI>Six per Cent.</HI> is too little, not to think him&s;elf wi&s;er than THE LEGISLATOR.</P>
<P>Again he &s;aith, <HI>That making the Bills a lawful Tender, would not have kept up them Value, and gives this Rea&s;on, becau&s;e our Import is more than the Produce of the Country will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ay for.</HI> A very poor Argument truly! When did we Rai&s;e &s;ufficient to Pay for our Import! Doth not our Import from one place, pay for what we Import from another place? Is not our whole De|pendance on Trade? Do we not Export one Com|modity, and Bring in another; and then Export that, and Bring in another? And this keeps the wheel a-going, imploys our Ships, and Men Abroad, and our Trade&s;-men at Home al&s;o; Silver was Shipt off as much before we had <HI>Province Bills,</HI> as &s;ince in proportion to our Trade; and ever will, while the
<PB N="4" REF="002106_0005_0fbb81e5fb660a18">
Merchant can find it a better Return than Goods; Is it not &s;o all the World over? What Place is there, from whence they do not Ship off Money, when it &s;uits their Occa&s;ions? Doth not <HI>England</HI> Ship off va&s;t Sums to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> and other Pla|ces? And doth not the &s;carcity or plenty of Silver there, govern the Price of it, as well as other things? Doth not <HI>England</HI> drein all the Plantations of Money, though they have <HI>Sugar, Indigo,</HI> and other Commodi|ties to make Returns with. I am per&s;waded, if the Bills now Abroad, were all Sunk this Day, and there was &s;o much Silver in its place, if the Silver were effectually &s;ecured from being Exported, it would not be <HI>One Peny</HI> better than the Paper Bills; neither would it have the lea&s;t influence on the price of any Merchandize what&s;oever; for what would the Silver be better than the Paper, if it could not be Ship'd off, but remain among us. Nay, it is plain, that the Paper would be better than the Silver, becau&s;e of the Five <HI>per Cent.</HI> allowed thereon in Publick Pay|ments; &s;o that it is plain, Silver is no longer Money with us but Merchandize; and therefore the Bills ought not to be e&s;teemed of le&s;s value, becau&s;e Silver Ri&s;es, it being no other than Merchandize; and &s;ought after by none but <HI>tho&s;e who want to Ship it off, as they do other Returns</HI> And farther, If we had as much Goods Imported from <HI>England</HI> as formerly, (in proportion to what we are grown to) can the Gentleman imagine, they would Sell for <HI>Two Hundred per Cent.</HI> No, It is a Maxim in Trade, <HI>The want of a Thing makes the worth of it</HI>; and therefore I &s;ay, if we had as full a Supply as formerly, Goods would be at the old Prices, and Silver would have &s;taid with us, notwith&s;tanding we had Province Bills; Exchange would have been as u&s;ual, and Returns al&s;o; &s;o that you &s;ee, it is the Plenty or Scarcity of Goods which over<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s every thing; and if &s;o, &s;urely it is our Inte|re&s;t
<PB N="5" REF="002106_0006_0fbb81e7ea28f800">
to court and encourage Trade; for it is the Price of <HI>European</HI> Goods that governs the Exchange, and the Price of Silver, and all other Returns; and this is very plain, for though the Bills grow &s;carcer, yet Goods of all &s;orts keep up their Prices: Nay, the &s;carcity of Bills helps to advance the Prices of Goods; for there being not a <HI>Medium</HI> to pay with, the Seller, if he mu&s;t take other things in Exchange for his Commodities will make his Price accordingly; &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hen the Shops, when they come to an&s;wer the Mer|chants Notes, are obliged to advance according to the Prices they give; and by this means the burden <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s laid on the poor Trades-men &amp; there the Hard&s;hip CENTERS, AND THEY ARE THE PEOPLE OPPRESSED THEREBY.</P>
<P>As I have &s;aid before, Money was always Ship'd Home&punc; and yet all that hath been Ship<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d off, would not have Run us into the&s;e Difficulties, but that the Scarcity of <HI>European</HI> Goods have kept up their Pri|ces, and there hath not been &s;ufficient Returns, to pay for what hath been Imported; and the Springs from whence we u&s;ed to have our Money, have fail|ed of late, <HI>viz. Jamaica, Curizo, &amp;c.</HI> &s;o that there &s;eems to be a complication of Misfottunes attending us, which hath Involved us in the&s;e Di&s;tre&s;&s;es; and I can &s;ee no likelihood of our having a Silver <HI>Me|dium,</HI> but by having a <HI>Paper Medium; as I &s;hall &s;hew you before I have done.</HI> For 1 There is no hopes of having Silver from <HI>Jamaica, &amp;c.</HI> becau&s;e of late years they find it more advantageous to bring Cocoa, and other Commodities from the Coa&s;t of <HI>New Spain,</HI> where they Trade, than Money; and this I experi|enced, by a Ve&s;&s;el I had on that Coa&s;t, not long &s;ince. And 2. We mu&s;t expect none from <HI>Old Spain,</HI> or <HI>Portugal,</HI> or the <HI>Streights,</HI> while our Fi&s;h Merchants can Remit their Money to <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Holland,</HI> and make <HI>Two Hundred per Cent.</HI> profit, on
<PB N="6" REF="002106_0007_0fbb81e92522f158">
their Goods from thence; or if they will bring Iron direct from <HI>Bilboa,</HI> may make <HI>Three Hundred per Cent.</HI> The Trea&s;urer of this Province, lately gave <HI>One Hundred and Forty per Cent.</HI> for a Bill of Exchange, to pay our Agent; then &s;urely there is little likelihood of Goods falling, if &s;uch an Exchange be given; for as you Settle the Exchange between <HI>England</HI> and us, the Price of <HI>European</HI> Goods, and of Silver, and all other Returns will ri&s;e and fall accordingly; where|fore mo&s;t certainly the way to make this Place flou|ri&s;h, is to make Trade as ea&s;ie and free as po&s;&s;ible, by having a &s;ufficient <HI>Medium</HI> to manage it, and by encouraging every body to come to us; let them bring as much Goods as they will, the more they bring, the Cheaper it will be; it is rea&s;onable to believe, that if we had of late Imported as much <HI>European</HI> Goods as formerly, in proportion to our Growth, they would have been at the old Prices as in times of Peace; and then <HI>One Hundred Pounds</HI> would have gone almo&s;t as far in making Returns, as <HI>Two</HI> doth now; and the Silver would have &s;taid with us al&s;o. And another Rea&s;on is, when <HI>European</HI> Goods were plenty, we Ship'd off great quantities to other Places, and brought other Returns for them; and this ENCOURAGED OUR NAVIGATION, AND WAS A GREAT ADVANTAGE EVERY WAY.</P>
<P>We are pritty much Circum&s;tanced like <HI>Holland,</HI> we Rai&s;e but little; if it were not for our Trade, we might Starve; and it's ea&s;ie to &s;ee the advantage of our Trade, by our Neighbours; who though they Rai&s;e for them&s;elves, and &s;upply us al&s;o; yet I pre|&s;ume none will deny, but that this Province hath grown in Riches and Strength fa&s;ter than any of 'em; and may do &s;o &s;till, if it be not our own faults; for as we decline, &s;o they decline al&s;o; &s;o that it &s;eems to me, as if Providence had de&s;igned
<PB N="7" REF="002106_0008_0fbb81ea8539c8a8">
this Place for the Head of the&s;e Provinces, if we are not wanting to our &s;elves. The State of <HI>Holland</HI> I ob&s;erve, (who are allowed to &s;ee their Intere&s;t with re&s;pect to Trade as much as any Nation in the World) are for drawing every body to them; and their Duty's on what ever is Imported, is but a trifle from the Importer, they lay the Duty's on the Con|&s;umption; but let Trade go in a manner free; and the Rea&s;on is this, &s;ay they, we are &s;ure of getting by every Ship that comes to us; whether they get by coming to us, is their bu&s;ine&s;s to con&s;ider, and not ours; and what I have &s;aid is true, with re&s;pect to this Country al&s;o; but more e&s;pecially with re&s;pect to this Town, who&s;e Flouri&s;hing, or Decay will have a very great influence on the E&s;tates of the whole Country.</P>
<P>The Gentleman &s;aith, <HI>What I &s;ay about burthening Trade, with heavy Duty's, he will not call Eva&s;ion</HI>; neither will any man, who remembers when Rum was <HI>Three Pounds Six Shillings, Eight pence per Hog&s;head,</HI> Duty's, Wine, <HI>Fifty Shillings per</HI> Pipe, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This was it which drove away our Trade to the Neighbouring Governments; for before the&s;e Duties were laid, <HI>Carolina, Virginia Pen&s;ilvania, Rhode-I&s;land, Connecticut, Pi&s;ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aqua,</HI> &amp;c. as well as our own Sea-ports, had their chief Supply from us; but the&s;e heavy Duties put them on Trade, and they &s;oon found they could &s;upply them&s;elves at better Rates than with us; and now are got to that heighth, that they oftentimes &s;upply us with the Commodities they <HI>u&s;ed to buy of us; but perhaps the Gentleman never heard this before.</HI></P>
<P>Again, he &s;eems more po&s;itive, then is con&s;i&s;tant with Prudence; <HI>He &s;aith, he is &s;ure, that to Emit more Bills, according to any Publick or Private Schaeme, which hath been yet Projected, will, but increa&s;e and prolong our Mi&s;ery.</HI> I confe&s;s it is ea&s;ie to Fore-&s;ee what may be the Con&s;equences of Emitting more Bills on the
<PB REF="002106_0009_0fbb81ec112213f0">
Publick Scheme; for we may expect the &s;ame Cau|&s;es will be attended with the &s;ame Effects, but what may be the advantages, or di&s;&s;advantages of a Private Bank. I am of opinion, no man can fore&s;ee, until we have tried the Experiment, and &s;ee the conveni|ences and inconveniences thereof; I am of Opinion, that a Private Bank would not have been attended with the inconveniencies the Publick hath been; and yet I don't pretend, that Silver would immediately fall in price, if there were a Private Bank; neither would it ri&s;e; for I &s;ee no rea&s;on to think that Silver will fall in Price, until Goods from <HI>England</HI> fall in their Prices; but it is ea&s;ie for the Government to make the Bank Bills, as good as the Province Bills; and they would not be daily Sinking as the Publick Bi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> are, to the great di&s;couragement of Trade, as well as <HI>Di&s;tre&s;&s;ing men in their particular Affairs.</HI></P>
<P>Again. The Gentleman <HI>is &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e be &s;aith, that to leave off Tru&s;ting, as far as it is practicable enough to do it, would in &s;ome time &s;et all things to Rights; and in another place be &s;aith again, he would have it left off as far as it might be left off well enough</HI>; I think I may <HI>well</HI> enough put his Sen&s;e again&s;t my Friends Logick he finds fault with; but I hope that Tru&s;ting will for the future grow more and more out of fa&s;hion with us; for that long Credit hath hurt us, no body will deny; But to make Laws to prevent it, or to charge the Debtor <HI>Ten per Cent.</HI> Intere&s;t, if he &s;lips his time, agreed on with his Creditor, is what I pre&s;ume was never attempted in any place what&s;oever: Were Money &s;o plenty, that men received nothing but Money for their Labour; and were this Truck Trade at an end, and the Trader Sold all for Mo|ney, and bought all with Money; Then I &s;hould think it a more proper time to propo&s;e &s;uch Laws, then now, when more then three Quarters of the Payments are made by Barter and Exchange of one
<PB N="9" REF="002106_0010_0fbb81ed8f7b41c0">
Commodity for another; and it will be many years before it can be expected to be otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>Our Circum&s;tances are &s;uch at this Day, that the Traders contrive how they can get others into their Debt, who they think will have Returns to Sell, that &s;o they may &s;ecure to them&s;elves the Refu&s;al of the Commodities they Rai&s;e, or get out of the Sea, or Import from Foreign Parts, and think they &s;erve them&s;elves by paying before-hand; becau&s;e thereby they purcha&s;e that with Goods, which otherwi&s;e they mu&s;t pay Money for; Nay, they have this double advantage; by this means they are &s;ure in an ordinary way, to have the Commodities they &s;hall want; and get off their Goods many times which would lie on hand, if they had not &s;uch ways to Di&s;|po&s;e of them; but the&s;e My&s;teries in Trade, the Gen|tleman is unacquainted with.</P>
<P>But I &s;uppo&s;e we are to abound with Silver by and by; For the Gentleman tells us, <HI>there was</HI> Ten Thou&s;and Pound <HI>in Silver brought in from one place the la&s;t year, and the like Sum Shipt off in one Ship which Poundered.</HI> I am &s;orry a man of his Charac|ter &s;hould be &s;o weak to impo&s;e on the World in a matter wherein he may be &s;o ea&s;ily Detected; I have made Enquiry, and there was not <HI>One Thou&s;and Pound</HI> aboard that Ship, there might be a little Gold al&s;o; but in all there was not much above <HI>One Thou&s;and Pound,</HI> and the <HI>Ten Thou&s;and Pounds</HI> he tells us was brought in is at be&s;t a mi&s;repre&s;entati|on; for any one who Reads his Account of that matter, would think there was &s;o much Money Imported hither from a Foreign Port; whereas it was Money brought to <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI>; and I have rea&s;on to believe, it came great part of it from the Pyrates; and Gentlemen went up from hence, and bought up the Money, Hides, and other Goods for Returns.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="002106_0011_0fbb81ef006ef258">Again, He tells us, <HI>There are Bills enough to Buy up all the Produce of the Country, and the Silver,</HI> &amp;c. but I think I have proved the contrary; but were that true, Is there enough to Buy and Sell with in the Shops, is there enough to pay Labourers and Trade&s;men, without forcing them to take Goods, which they know not what to do with, except to put them on their Backs; for which &s;ome people are very angry, and &s;ay they go beyond their degree; where|as the People would not Expend it in &s;uch ways, if it were at their own di&s;po&s;al; and the Merchants cannot pay them otherwi&s;e than by Shop Notes, be|cau&s;e the Shops can't Sell for Money; and con&s;e|quently can't pay Money to the Merchants; and thus is Trade mi&s;erably imbarras'd, and the Poor oppre&s;&s;ed, for want of a <HI>Medium</HI>; I can't but ob|&s;erve, that my Friend owns there is not enough to pay Labourers; and I mu&s;t ob&s;erve al&s;o, that he takes no care how they &s;hall be paid.</P>
<P>I have heard &s;ome lay the Cau&s;e of the Di&s;tre&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s of the Town on the People; and &s;ay, Pride and La|zine&s;s will bring any People into &s;uch Circum&s;tances; but I think whoever gives that Character of this Town, abu&s;e them; they who &s;ay &s;o of them, per|haps never did a days work in their Lives. This Town is as indu&s;trious a place as any, if they have Work to do; if they &s;tand idle, it is becau&s;e no man hath hired them; not that I will &s;ay, there are no Drones in the Hive. There are indolent Thoughtle&s;s People in all Places, but the Body of the People are willing to be doing, if they can find Employment. But it is well if for want of Bu&s;ine&s;s, the People do not get an habit of Idle+ne&s;s&punc; and run into Vices, <HI>which when once accu&s;tomed to&punc; it is hard breaking them&s;elves of.</HI></P>
<P>Next he tells us, he hath found two incon&s;i&s;tan|ces; he &s;aith, if the Import be &s;o &s;mall, one would
<PB REF="002106_0012_0fbb81f2fb112f70">
think the Produce of the Country will be &s;ufficient for Returns; but I have told him already, that the Import being &s;mall, the Goods fetch near double what it u&s;ed to do; and that we don't Rai&s;e half the Returns we make, but Import it by our Trade; If we did not by our Trade to the <HI>I&s;lands North and South Carolina, Virginia,</HI> &amp;c. Import Pitch, Tar, Hides, Tobacco, Rice, Skins, Sugar, Oyl, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> What &s;hould we have to make Returns with? And if we had not occa&s;ion for the&s;e Returns, <HI>what would become of our Trade, on which the Welfare of the whole depend</HI>? His other Incon&s;i&s;tency is, <HI>That it is the Intere&s;t of every private man to Sell his Silver to the highe&s;t Bid|der,</HI> then &s;aith he it is the Intere&s;t of the Country in general, becau&s;e all the private per&s;ons contained in it, will make up the whole Country; a wi&s;e Speech I prote&s;t, worthy of &s;even years &s;tudy at the Univer&s;ity; Well, I'll venture to inform the Gentleman in this my&s;terious point; That which is the Intere&s;t of every man Collectively as a Body, is the Intere&s;t of the Country in general, becau&s;e in <HI>that</HI> Relation they are the Country; but nothing is more certain, <HI>than that</HI> it may be the Intere&s;t of Pri|vate Men to Buy up Silver, and Ship it off; and that their doing &s;o, may be hurtful to the Com|munity. <HI>And now what is become of my Friends Incon|&s;i&s;tencies</HI>?</P>
<P>Again, he tells us, <HI>Our Silver and Gold is gone already, and our Lands will go next, (if Tru&s;ting be allowed) I pre&s;ume he don't mean, that the Factors will Ship them off for</HI> England. So then, after all this mighty Tu&s;&s;el, he is come to me at la&s;t; for that I &s;ay, is what People are afraid of; <HI>That the Lands will fall into a few hands, and &s;o we &s;hall have a few Lords, and the Body of the People Beggars.</HI></P>

Provinces. He &s;aith, <HI>He is of the mind, that it is impo&s;&s;ible, that either Town or Country &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t without &s;ome Medium or other.</HI> And I'll venture to be as po|&s;itive as he; I am &s;ure he is in the Right</P>
<P>As to the Opinion of the Whale-men, where the Gentleman hath lately been, I confe&s;s I am ignorant; but of this, I am well a&s;&s;ured, that it is the opinion of by far the greate&s;t part of the four Provinces, that unle&s;s there be more Bills, made on one foot or other, the Country will be ruined; and to make more on the old Scheme we &s;ee will never do; therefore I hope it will be done by private men, and I make no doubt we &s;hall &s;ee the good Effects thereof: <HI>Our An&s;werer indeed tells us, a Private Bank will involve us into greater Mi&s;chiefs than the Publick hath done, but that his is only Opinion:</HI> And I mu&s;t tell him, that man in Trade, whom I pre&s;ume have have as much rea&s;on to under&s;tand the&s;e things as him&s;elf, are of a quite different opinion.</P>
<P>(<HI>Well, but now my Friend &s;en&s;ible of his weakne&s;s, and tells us, he doubts he &s;hall be playing the fool a|gain</HI>; and I confe&s;s, I am very apt to believe him, for I have &s;een little el&s;e in his whole perfor|mance; by what he &s;aith in his twelfth page; he &s;eems to fear the Government being bya&s;&s;ed by the Power of Money as well as the Bankers; but I have a better opinion of tho&s;e Worthy Gentlemen, and would hope there is no danger of that; &amp; that if ever a Bank be Erected, the Government will have a careful and jealous Eye over it, to prevent the Bankers doing any thing which may be hurtful to the Publick; and farther, I am of opinion, it always will be in their Power &s;o to do.</P>
<P>Well now I find the Gentleman an&s;wers a whole Catalogue of Evils which were mentioned to him by this &s;hort Sentence (<HI>Leave off Tru&s;ting)</HI> this is his &s;overeign Remedy to cure all Maladies: Nay, he

tells us, this will bring Silver among&s;t us again, but I prote&s;t I can't believe him, becau&s;e I ob&s;erve, that &s;ince we have given le&s;s Credit then formerly, Mo|ney yet grows &s;carcer than ever; and what is wor&s;e &s;till, Silver doth &s;o as well as Bills; whereas he told us, that <HI>Silver would come in as the Bills left us, and &s;tay among&s;t us.</HI></P>
<P>But the Gentleman tells us, <HI>If People can't Live in the Town, let them go into the Country</HI>; but certainly he &s;pake before he thought, when he made that propo|&s;al; perhaps the Gentleman is in hopes of a good Benefice in the Country in time, (<HI>though he is no Sa|lary Man at pre&s;ent he tells us</HI>) &amp; it may &s;uit him well enough to go there, &amp; be maintained honourably, as I would have all of his Function be; But it is very hard for Trade&s;men, who have Lived all their Days in the Town, and have got Families, to pluck up Stakes, and remove into the Country, to &s;eek their Sub&s;i&s;tence in a way they have never been accu&s;to|med to; and know nothing of; and again, there are abundance of People in the Town, who make a &s;hift by their Labour, to maintain their Families comfortably; but lay up little afore-hand, &s;uch People have nothing to carry with them into the Country; &s;o that they and their Families mu&s;t be more mi&s;erable there, than in the Town: but I think <HI>he would have them turn Labourers</HI> (a very hard propo&s;al I confe&s;s) <HI>and &s;aith, they want their Labour in the Country, if they would work at a moderate rate, and tells us, they don<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t want Money to pay them</HI>; but I find the people in the Country generally differ very much from the Gentleman in this matter; and complain they can't get Money to pay Taxes to the Government, and the Mini&s;try; and &s;ay, if there be not &s;ome Medium found, their Stocks mu&s;t <HI>go quickly for the&s;e U&s;es; and their Lands at last.</HI> I have heard that &s;ome &s;ay, it will never be good

times, until Labourers come to work for a Groat for Six-pence a day; but I hope it will never be &s;o in <HI>New-England</HI>; and that the Poor will always live like men, as hitherto, through the good Providence of God they have done, and not as bad or wor&s;e than our <HI>Indians</HI>; as it is in &s;ome parts of the World.</P>
<P>Again, My Friend tells us, <HI>There is no danger of People getting their Neighbours Lands at half value</HI>; but we have only his bare word for it; for I am &s;ure, he hath not given us any rea&s;on to induce us to be|lieve the contrary; though he an&s;wers that matter darkly, I'll &s;et it in &s;o true a light, that he that runs may Read it, &s;uppo&s;e Silver &s;hould come to <HI>Twenty</HI> or <HI>Thirty Shillings per Ounce,</HI> as it is at <HI>Carolina</HI>; for it may come to be &s;o &s;carce, that it can't be pur|cha&s;ed at any rate; for I &s;ay, the plenty or &s;carcity of it, governs the Price of that, as all other things; then I &s;uppo&s;e our good friends will value <HI>Thirty Shillings</HI> in Bills, to be worth <HI>Six Shillings</HI> and <HI>Eight Pence</HI>; and Mens E&s;tates will be taken from them at a price accordingly; and &s;o an E&s;tate which co&s;t a <HI>Thou&s;and Pounds,</HI> will go for <HI>Two Hundred,</HI> and this is the Contrivance to keep the E&s;tates in many mens hands; but the Gentleman may preach it long enough, before he will bring any body to believe him.</P>
<P>Well, now the Gentleman comes to &s;ee his Error, and owns, <HI>that he hath expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in too &s;trong terms, about &s;hortning Credit; and allows &s;ome Credit is nece&s;&s;ary among Traders</HI>; and therein he &s;aith no more than the whole World will ju&s;tifie him in: But yet I &s;ee his great aver&s;ion to Foreign Commodities clings to him; and his whole plea is for a Ready Money Trade; the&s;e things &s;eem wonderfully to affect him; Though the Medium is &s;o Exhau&s;ted, that there is &s;carce one Eight part of the Trade

<P>Again he &s;aith, <HI>That man hath a mind to think hard of the Government, who thinks that they will not (where things come to Extremities) admit Mortgages to be Redee|med, and Taxes to pay in the Produce of the Country, or in Silver.</HI> A fine Speech I confe&s;s, as if any man were &s;o ignorant to think, that the Mortgagee would Refu&s;e Silver, or that Silver would not an&s;wer for Taxes; May not I call this an amu&s;ement, or what what will you call it?</P>
<P>Some among us have had the advantage of Selling their Silver, and advancing thereon, until they have Rai&s;ed it to <HI>Twelve Shillings per Ounce</HI>; by this they have advanced their E&s;tates one third part, &amp; now they have no Silver to make an advantage by Selling, they are for turning the Scale; ju&s;t now the Bills were too light for the Silver, and therefore they mu&s;t have <HI>Twelve Shillings,</HI> for <HI>Eight Shillings</HI> worth of Silver: And now they would have every thing Re|gulated by what Silver was at, when it was plenty among&s;t us: And when the Bills are all in, you mu&s;t procure 'em Silver at <HI>Eight Shillings per Ounce</HI>; nay, it may be at <HI>Six Shillings Eight Pence,</HI> to Redeem an E&s;tate, becau&s;e you don't procure 'em Province Bills, according to the Tenor of your Mortgage, when it will be impo&s;&s;ible to procure Province Bills to do it; for admit there were enough Bills abroad to redeem all the Mortgages to the Publick; what will become of the Mortgages made to Private Men, and of the Bonds abroad from man to man, <HI>on Per&s;onal Security; where is a Medium to Di&s;charge them with?</HI> The only

Method <HI>that</HI> the Gentleman hath contrived to Extri|cate us out of our Difficulties, is to <HI>turn U&s;urers</HI>; but after all he hath &s;aid thereon to &s;hew the feaziblene&s;s of it, I believe all Trading Men will think (<HI>as he &s;eems to be aware they would</HI>) <HI>that it is the mo&s;t unhappy one he could have hit on</HI>; and had he con&s;ulted the Prophet <HI>Nehemiah,</HI> he would have known better, then to have made &s;uch a Propo&s;al. But I think I have &s;aid enough concerning our Methods in Buying and Selling, to &s;hew the impo&s;&s;ibility of coming into his Propo&s;als at pre&s;ent: Were Money as plenty as in <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Days, the Government I am per&s;waded, would never be brought into &s;uch a Law; much le&s;s in our pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances. I am &s;orry the Gentleman hath meddled in an Affair, in which he is &s;o ignorant; and made him&s;elf a Tool to a party, &s;ome of whom perhaps know as little of Trade as him&s;elf: There are &s;ome who would be glad of Sil|ver to pa&s;s among us again, but will never venture any part of their own E&s;tates to bring any to us.

<P>I Had Thoughts at the Meeting of the General Court to propo&s;e a Method for a Bank, which may an&s;wer the Occa&s;ions of the Land at pre&s;ent and be a means to bring Silver to pa&s;s among us a|gain in time; for it is my fixt Opinion, it mu&s;t be the work of time, and that it will be many years be|fore we mu&s;t expect a Medium of Silver currant with us; and the Method I would propo&s;e, is as followeth.</P>
<P N="1">1. That a &s;uitable Sum be agreed on, and that a Land Bank be Erected, for we have no other Foun|dation to build upon.</P>
<P N="2">2.

<P N="3">3. That no per&s;on have ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> more than two Thirds of the Value of his Lands, for which he &s;hall pay <HI>Six per Cent.</HI> Intere&s;t in Bills.</P>

That the whole profits, ari&s;ing by the Intere&s;t, after the nece&s;&s;ary Charge is defray'd, be laid out in Silver on the be&s;t terms it can be purcha&s;ed, and remain in the Bank as a Fund, or colateral Security, until the profits amount unto the original Sum Emitted; this will add to the va|lue of the Bills, and as the Profits grow by the Intere&s;t, &s;o will the Bills grow in value; and by this Project I &s;up|po&s;e, in about twenty years, the Profits will amount to the Sum fir&s;t Emitted; and the Bank may (if it be tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e be&s;t by them who then have the management of Affairs) In one day Call in all their Notes and pay everyr one Silver for his Note, at <HI>Eight Shillings per Ounce,</HI> and thee will be the &s;ame Sum abroad in Silver, which was abroad in Pa|per before</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="18" REF="002106_0019_0fbb81feb91f0430">5.

<P>For Fir&s;t, It will be an ea&s;ein Trade, for any man, who hath Credit in the Bank, may draw a Note on the Bank, and his Creditor, will go and receive his Bills, or have &s;o much Transfer'd to his Account, by virtue of his Note, or he may Endor&s;e his Note to a third per&s;on, and he to another, and &s;o from man to man; by which much time may be &s;aved. And Secondly, by this me|thod he who hath Credit in the Bank runs no Ri&s;k of his Bills, either of Fire, Thieves, or any other Ca&s;ualty; and though this being a new thing here, People at fir&s;t perhaps may rather chu&s;e to receive &amp; pay their Bills away them&s;elves; yet in a little time the ea&s;e and conveniency of it would be &s;o obvious to every man, that there would not be abundance of Notes, or Bills abroad: and this would be a great means to prevent Counterfeits; and I am of opinion, a &s;hort note on &s;tampt paper, part printed&punc; &amp; part written, would be &s;afer than Ingraven Plates; how ea&s;ie it is to Counterfeir tho&s;e plates, experience hath &s;hewn us; &amp; certainly the Notes &s;hould be fill'd &amp; Sign'd by good Pen men; for it is ea&s;ier to Counterfeit bad Writng than good.

<P>The&s;e things I have thought on, as a likely method to keep us alive, until Silver become again currant among us, which I fear will not be very &s;uddenly; for I can &s;ee no way to bring in any quantity of Silver; for while <HI>European</HI> Goods continue &s;o very high, we can't expect it from Old <HI>Spain</HI>; and the I&s;lands who u&s;ed to fetch it from <HI>Mew-Spain,</HI> find it their Intere&s;t to Trade with them for other Commodities rather than Silver; &s;o we can't expect much from them: What little comes in, goes away as fa&s;t as it comes for Returns to <HI>England</HI>; how vain then is is for us to pretend to have Silver to pa&s;s among us; and all men agree in this, that there is no living without &s;ome Medium: Then &s;urely what can be the de&s;ign of tho&s;e who oppo&s;e every thing of this nature, and propo&s;e no|thing to Relieve us: We are a dependant Government, and have our bounds &s;et us; our Charter carries with it

<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e plus Ultra</HI>: We are to do nothing which may &s;eem to bear hard on the Trade of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> el&s;e I would propo&s;e that &s;ome way be contrived to prevent the Exportation of what Silver comes in; tho it be but little it, would help us &s;omething; but there is no way, but by making &s;evere Laws, &amp; to &s;ee them carefully Executed; and whether it would be allowed us by the Crown &s;o to do, is what we have rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect: However, I'll venture to mention them, and &s;o leave 'em with them, who&s;e Province it is to con&s;ider what is mo&s;t proper to be done at &s;uch a time as this is. (1.) That a Law be made, that neither Buyer nor Seller, &s;hall give or receive for Silver, more than <HI>Eight Shillings per</HI> Ounce, on penalty of forfeiture of the Money, and Six Months Impri&s;onment; the Money &s;o forfeited, to go to the Informer. And (2.) That every Ma&s;ter, Sailor, or Freighter, before any Ve&s;&s;el Sails, be obliged to Swear, that they neither have, nor will put an Ounce A|board their Ve&s;&s;el they Sail in, or Freight on: This I confe&s;s would be attended with difficulty; but could it be effected, it would keep your Silver, and rai&s;e the Value of your Bills al&s;o: for what would the Silver be better than the Bills, if it could not be Ship'd off: It's plain, that the day you prevent your &s;ilver being bought and Sold as Merchandize that day will your Paper Bills be equal, if not &s;uperiour to Silver, according to Act of Parliament: &s;o that Silver being as I &s;aid before, only Merchandize, the value of your Bills ought not to be regulated thereby, any more than by the Price of O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l, or any other Returns, did Silver pa&s;s Currant in payment among&s;t us, at <HI>Eight Shil|lings per</HI> Ounce as formerly, and the Bills would pa&s;s in Trade but for <HI>Fourteen Shillings</HI> in the Pound, then I would own the Bills were <HI>Fifty per Cent.</HI> wor&s;e than the Silver, and not until then.</P>
<P>But it is a vanity I confe&s;s to think that a private Bank would an&s;wer, without the Government &s;upport &amp; encou|rage it by &s;uitable Laws, as they have done the Province Bills: and why they &s;hould refu&s;e &s;o to do, I mu&s;t leave: What is the Intere&s;t of Private Men, &s;urely is the Intere&s;t of the whole in a matter of this nature, it being of a pub|lick nature, tho' in the hands of particular per&s;ons: if &s;uch a Bank were allowed to go on, the Government might &s;o &s;teer it by their Laws, that it would never <HI>be in the power of the Bankers to do any thing prejudicial to the Publick Good,</HI></P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="002106_0021_0fbb8201b74f9390">Mo&s;t certainly the Country would be greatly inrich'd by it: That I think I can make very plain, &amp; the Riches of a place very much &s;trengthens it, &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e were <HI>Two Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds</HI> Emitted on Land Security, which with what Publick Bills are now out might I am of opinion, &s;ufficient to manage the Trade at pre&s;ent: The Intere&s;t thereof would be <HI>Twelve Thou&s;and Pounds per Annum,</HI> allow <HI>One Thou&s;and Pounds per Annum</HI> to Officers, and for other Charges in managing it: There remains <HI>Eleven Thou&s;and Pounds per Annum.</HI> This is &s;o much gained, and no man hurt by it: for if a man Mortgage his E&s;tate: Surely none will &s;ay, he is the poorer for &s;o doing, &s;ince he Receives &s;o much thereon, either to pay his Debts, or to improve in Trade, and tho&s;e who want it&punc; for neither of the before mentioned U&s;es, will yet be fond of being concerned in the Bank becau&s;e they can let their Bills out to Intere&s;t on per&s;onal Security, and be intituled to their Profits in the Bank at &s;ame time&punc; &s;o that the Country will be 200000<HI>l.</HI> Richer, if this Projection were &s;et on foot, as &s;oon as the Sub&s;ciptions are full.</P>
<P>But &s;ome will &s;ay, what &s;ignifies the Profits in the Bank, when it is propo&s;ed, they &s;hould remain there, &amp; not be divided: I an&s;wer, it will an&s;wer the end of the Per&s;on concerned, as well as if divided; for in a few years, when the Profits are come to be worth dividing: Any man who is minded to part with his Profits, who&s;e occa&s;ions oblige him to do may Sell it to his Neighbour, as Bank Stock is Sold in <HI>London,</HI> every day; and no doubt in a few years the Stock here would be &s;o transferr'd from man to man daily as it is there, and I can &s;ee no harm in improving a man's Money this way, any more than in any other way: it be|hoves every man in Buying and Selling, to have a care of Sharpers: for they may be Cheated other ways, as well as by Stock Jobbing.</P>
<P>But the grand Argument with &s;ome men again&s;t a <HI>Paper Medium</HI> is this: They &s;ay, Paper hath no intrin&s;ick value in it, and ridicule it, &s;aying, what value is there in a piece of Paper? But I think that a very weak argument, and indeed unfair, to compare Bank Bills, or Province Bills to blank Paper: What intrin&s;ick value is there in Silver, or Gold, more than in Iron, Bra&s;s, or Tinn, but only the common acceptation of it by men in Trade, as a <HI>Medium of Exchange.</HI> Is not every thing in this World, ju&s;t as men

This Objection I think is already obviated, for if it be under the in&s;pection of the Govern|ment, as I have already propo&s;ed: They will appoint Vi&s;iters, to whom the Books mu&s;t always lie open, &s;o that it will not be in the Power of the Bankers to Emit any thing more than what the Government approve of. No doubt but they will (as the Province Bills fink) find it nece&s;&s;ary to allow the Bank from time to time, to make as many Bank Bills as they &s;ink of the Province Bills.</P>
<P>I have been in the Bank of <HI>England</HI> &amp; have ob&s;erved the great Conveniencies thereof &amp; am per&s;waded in the time that Bank hath &s;tood: Such a Bank as I have propo&s;ed, would an&s;wer our Occa&s;ions as well as the Bank of <HI>England</HI> or the Bank of <HI>Holland</HI> an&s;wers with them: The only Argument which is brought again&s;t it, is, That they have Money; and any man may have Money for his Note on damand: There indeed we differ, they abourd with Money, but we have none at all; Had we a plenty of Silver as formerly, we &s;hould have no need of a Bank: But I am per&s;waded we &s;hall never have Silver pa&s;s among us again as Money, until Trade take &s;uch a Turn, that <HI>Europaean</HI> Goods falls &s;o in prices, that it will not an&s;wer to &s;end away Silver, or that we by going on Manufactu|res live more independent of them for that being our main Trade: The plenty or &s;carcity of their Commodities, will govern Exchange, and con&s;equently the price of Silver.

<P>Thus I have adventured to give my thoughts as to the Cau&s;es of our pre&s;ent dark Circum&s;tances, which I have done, with a &s;incere aim at the Publick Good; I Acknow|ledge my unfitne&s;s for &s;uch an undertaking: and wi&s;h that &s;ome of the Bright Gentlemen of our Land (of which it is not Barren) had &s;aved me the labour; &amp; that &s;ome of them would yet be&s;tow a few Hours in thinking what m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y be for the Releife of the Place, and indeed this I think to be the duty of every Man, and would hope that out of the Projections of many, &s;omething may be found that may be of &s;ervice: what I have now written I expect will be Received according to the dffierent Sentiments &amp; Intere&s;ts of Men; I am &s;orry for the growing divi&s;ions among&s;t us, and believe our growing difficulties are in a great mea&s;ure the cau&s;e, and wi&s;h that a Remedy may be found to heal them, I conclude with this wi&s;h, That, the Ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven may attend the General Court in their pre&s;ent Se&s;&s;ions; in all the arduous affairs which may come before them, and that they may be the happy In&s;truments in the Hand of the Almighty to Repair our Breaches, that the Ble&s;&s;ing of them that are ready to peri&s;h may come upon them.</P>
