<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS di&s;cour&s;e, and tho&s;e on the <HI>Evidences of Divine Revelation,</HI> which will be publi&s;hed about the &s;ame time, being the la&s;t of my labours in this country, I hope my friends, and the public, will indulge me while I give the rea&s;on of their <HI>being</HI> the <HI>la&s;t,</HI> in con&s;equence of my having at length, after much he&s;itation, and and now with reluctance, come to a re&s;olution to leave this kingdom.</P>
<P>After the riots in Birmingham, it was the ex|pectation, and evidently the wi&s;h, of many per|&s;ons, that I &s;hould immediately fly to France, or America. But I had no con&s;cious&s;ne&s;s of guilt to induce me to fly my country<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If, in&s;tead of flying from lawle&s;s violence, I had been flying from public ju&s;tice, I could not have been pur&s;ued with more rancour, nor could my friends have been more anxious for my &s;afty. One man, who happened to &s;ee me on hor&s;eback on one of the nights in which I e&s;caped from Birmingham, expre&s;&s;ed his regret that he had not taken me. expecting probably &s;ome con&s;iderable reward, when, as he &s;aid, it was &s;o ea&s;y for him to have done it. My friends earne&s;tly advi&s;ed me to di&s;gui&s;e my&s;elf as I was going to Lon|don. But all that was done in that way was taking a place for me in the mail coach, which I entered at Worce&s;ter, in ano|ther name than my own. However, the friend who had the courage to receive me in London had thought it nece&s;&s;ary to provide a dre&s;s that &s;hould di&s;gui&s;e me, and al&s;o a me|thod of making my e&s;cape, in ca&s;e the hou&s;e &s;hould have been attacked on my account; and for &s;ome time my friends would not &s;uffer me to appear in the &s;treets.</NOTE> On the contrary,
<PB N="vi" REF="027559_0004_0FD5350CD2A1E1D8">
I came directly to London, and in&s;tantly, by means of my friend Mr. Ru&s;&s;el, &s;ignified to the king's mini&s;ters, that I <HI>was</HI> there, and ready, if they thought proper, to be interrogated on the &s;ubject of the riot. But no notice was taken of the me&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>Ill treated as I thought I had been, not merely by the populace of Birmingham, for they were the mere tools of their &s;uperiors, but by the country in general, which evidently exulted in our &s;ufferings, and afterwards by the repre|&s;entatives of the nation, who refu&s;ed to inquire into the cau&s;e of them, I own I was not without deliberating upon the &s;ubject of emigration; and &s;everal flattering propo&s;als were made me, e&s;pe|cially from France, which was then at peace with|in it&s;elf, and with all the world; and I was at
<PB N="vii" REF="027559_0005_0FD5350CD765A790">
one time much inclined to go thither, on account of its nearne&s;s to England, the agreeablene&s;s of its climate, and my having many friends there.</P>
<P>But I likewi&s;e con&s;idered that, If I went thither, I &s;hould have no employment of the kind to which I had been accu&s;tomed; and the &s;ea&s;on of active life not being, according to the cour&s;e of nature, quite over, I wi&s;hed to make as much u&s;e of it as I could. I therefore determined to continue in England, expo&s;ed as I was not only to unbounded obloquy and in&s;ult, but to every kind of outrage; and after my invitation to &s;ucceed my friend Dr Price, I had no he&s;itation about it. Ac|cordingly I took up my re&s;idence where I now am, though &s;o prevalent was the idea of my in&s;e|curity, that I was not able to take the hou&s;e in my own name; and when a friend of mine took it in <HI>his,</HI> it was with much difficulty that, after &s;ome time, the landlord was prevailed upon to transfer the lea&s;e to me. He expre&s;&s;ed his apprehen&s;ions, not only of the hou&s;e that I occupied being de|moli&s;hed, but al&s;o a capital hou&s;e in which he him&s;elf re&s;ides, at the di&s;tance of no le&s;s than twenty miles from London, whether he &s;uppo&s;ed the rioters would go next, merely for &s;uffering me to live in a hou&s;e of <HI>his.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="027559_0006_0FD5350FB8DF5B50">
But even this does not give &s;uch an idea of the danger that not only my&s;elf, but every per&s;on, and every thing, that had the &s;lighte&s;t connection with me, were &s;uppo&s;ed to be in, as the following. The managers of one of the principal charities among the Di&s;&s;enters applied to me to preach their annual &s;ermon, and I had con&s;ented. But the trea&s;urer, a man of fortune, who knew nothing more of me than my name, was &s;o much alarmed as it, that he declared he could not &s;leep. I there|fore, to his great relief, declined preaching at all.</P>
<P>When it was known that I was &s;ettled where I now am, &s;everal of my friends, who lived near me, were &s;eriou&s;ly advi&s;ed to remove their papers, and other mo&s;t valuable effects, to &s;ome place of greater &s;afety in London. On the 14th of July, 1792, it was taken for granted by many of the neighbours, that my hou&s;e was to come down, ju&s;t as at Birmingham the year before. When the Hackney a&s;&s;ociation was formed, &s;everal &s;ervants in the neighbourhood actually removed their goods; and when there was &s;ome political meet|ing at the hou&s;e of Mr. Breillat, though about two miles from my hou&s;e, a woman who&s;e daugh|ter was &s;ervant in the hou&s;e contiguous to mine, came to her mi&s;tre&s;s, to entreat that &s;he might be out of the way; and it was not without much
<PB N="ix" REF="027559_0007_0FD5350E379ECCD0">
difficulty that &s;he was, pacified, and prevailed upon to let her continue in the hou&s;e, her mi&s;tre&s;s &s;ay|ing that &s;he was as &s;afe as her&s;elf.</P>
<P>On &s;everal other occa&s;ions the neighbourhood has been greatly alarmed on account of my being &s;o near them. Nor was this without apparent rea&s;on. I could name a per&s;on, and to appear|ance a reputable trade&s;man, who, in the company of his friends, and in the hearing of one of my late congregation at Birmingham, but without know|ing him to be &s;uch, declared that, in ca&s;e of any di&s;turbance, they would immediately come to Hackney, evidently for the purpo&s;e of mi&s;chief. In this &s;tate of things, it is not to be wondered at, that of many &s;ervants who were recommended to me, and &s;ome that were actually hired, very few could, for a long time, be prevailed upon to live with me.</P>
<P>The&s;e facts not only &s;hew how general was the idea of my particular in&s;ecurity in this country; but what is of much more con&s;equence, and highly intere&s;ting to the country at large, an idea of the general di&s;po&s;ition to rioting and violence that prevails in it, and that the Di&s;&s;enters are the ob|jects of it. Mr. Pitt very ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, in his &s;peech on the &s;ubject of the riots at Birmingham,
<PB N="x" REF="027559_0008_0FD53511D6CECE60">
that it was "the efferve&s;cence of the public mind." Indeed the efferve&s;cible matter has exi&s;ted in this country every &s;ince the civil wars in the time of Charles I. and it was particularly apparent in the reign of Queen Ann. But the power of govern|ment under the former princes of the Hou&s;e of Hanover prevented its doing any mi&s;chief. The late events &s;hew that this power is no longer exert|ed as it u&s;ed to be, but that, on the contrary, there prevails an idea, well or ill founded, that tumultu|ary proceedings again&s;t Diffenters will not receive any effectual di&s;couragement. After what has taken place with re&s;pect to Birmingham, all idea of much hazard for in&s;ulting and abu&s;ing the Di&s;|&s;enters is entirely vani&s;hed; whereas the di&s;po&s;i|tion to injure the Catholics was effectually checked by the proceedings of the year 1780. From that time <HI>they</HI> they have been &s;afe, and I rejoice in it. But from the year 1791, the Diffenters have been more expo&s;ed to in&s;ult and outrage than over.</P>
<P>Having fixed my&s;elf at Clapton; unhinged as I had been, and having lo&s;t the labour of &s;everal years; yet flattering my&s;elf that I &s;hould end my days here, I took a long lea&s;e of my hou&s;e, and expended a con&s;iderable &s;um in improving it. I al&s;o determined, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of my friends, to re&s;ume my philo&s;ophical and other pur&s;uits;
<PB N="xi" REF="027559_0009_0FD53514533D2008">
and after an interruption amounting to about two years, it was with a plea&s;ure that I cannot de&s;|cribe, that I entered my new laboratory, and began the mo&s;t common preparatory proce&s;&s;es, with a view to &s;ome original inquiries. With what &s;ucce&s;s I have laboured, the public has al|ready in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;een, and may &s;ee more hereafter.</P>
<P>But though I did not choo&s;e (notwith&s;tand|ing I found my&s;elf expo&s;ed to continual in&s;ult) to leave my native country, I found it nece&s;&s;ary to provide for my &s;ons el&s;ewhere. My elde&s;t &s;on was &s;ettled in a bu&s;ine&s;s, which promi&s;ed to be very advantageous, at Manche&s;ter; but his partner, though a man of liberality him&s;elf, in|formed him, on perceiving the general preva|lence of the &s;pirit which produced the riots in Bir|mingham, that, owing to his relation&s;hip to <HI>me,</HI> he was under the nece&s;&s;ity of propo&s;ing a &s;epara|tion, which accordingly took place.</P>
<P>On this he had an invitation to join another connexion, in a bu&s;ine&s;s in which the &s;pirit of party could not have much affected him; but he declined it. And after he had been pre|&s;ent at the a&s;&s;izes at Warwick, he conceived &s;uch an idea of this country, that I do not be|lieve
<PB N="xii" REF="027559_0010_0FD53515D0295FF8">
that any propo&s;al, however advantageous, would have induced him to continue in it; &s;o much was he affected on perceiving his father treated as I had been.</P>
<P>Determining to go to America, where he had no pro&s;pect but that of being a farmer, he wi&s;hed to &s;pend a &s;hort time with a per&s;on who has great|ly di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in that way, and one who from his own general principles, and his friend|&s;hip for my&s;elf, would have given him the be&s;t advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance in his power. He, however, declined it, and acknowledged &s;ome time after, that had it been known, as it mu&s;t have been, to his landlord, that he had a &s;on of <HI>mine</HI> with him, he feared he &s;hould have been turned out of his farm.</P>
<P>My &s;econd &s;on who was pre&s;ent both at the riot, and the a&s;&s;izes, felt more indignation &s;till, and willingly li&s;tened to a propo&s;al to &s;ettle in France; and there his reception was but too &s;latter|ing. However, on the breaking out of the war with this country, all mercantile pro&s;pects being &s;u&s;pended, he wi&s;hed to go to America. There his elde&s;t and younge&s;t brother have joined him, and they are now looking out for a &s;ettlement, having as yet no fixed views.</P>
<P><PB N="xiii" REF="027559_0011_0FD5351D45CB90F8">
The nece&s;&s;ity I was under of &s;ending my &s;ons out of this country, was my principal inducement to &s;end the little property that I had out of it too; &s;o that I had nothing in England be&s;ides my libra|ry, apparatus, and hou&s;ehold goods. By this, I felt my&s;elf greatly relieved, it being of little con&s;equence where a man already turned &s;ixty ends his days. Whatever good or evil I have been capable of, is now chiefly done; and I tru&s;t that the &s;ame con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of integrity, which has &s;upported me hitherto, will carry me through any thing that may yet be re&s;erved for me. Seeing, however, no great pro&s;pect of doing much good, or having much enjoyment, here, I am now preparing to follow my &s;ons; hoping to be of &s;ome u&s;e to them in their pre&s;ent un&s;ettled &s;tate, and that Provi|dence may yet, advancing in years as I am, find me &s;ome &s;phere of u&s;efulne&s;s along with them.</P>
<P>As to the great odium that I have incurred, the charge of <HI>&s;edition,</HI> or my being an enemy to the con&s;titution or peace of my country, is a mere pre|tence for it; though it has been &s;o much urged, that it is now generally believed, and all attempts to undeceive the public with re&s;pect to it avail no|thing at all. The whole cour&s;e of my &s;tudies, from early life, &s;hews how little <HI>politics</HI> of any kind have been my object. Indeed to have writ|ten &s;o much as I have in <HI>theology,</HI> and to have
<PB N="xiv" REF="027559_0012_0FD5351FA16A5A10">
done &s;o much in <HI>experimental philo&s;ophy,</HI> and at the &s;ame time to have had my mind occupied, as it is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been, with factious politics, I mu&s;t have had faculties more than human. Let any per&s;on only ca&s;t his eye over the long li&s;t of my publications, and he will &s;ee that they relate almo&s;t wholly to theology, philo&s;ophy, or gene|ral literature.</P>
<P>I did, however, when I was a younger man, and before it was in my power to give much attention to philo&s;ophical pur&s;uits, write a &s;mall anonymous political pamphlet, on the <HI>State of Liberty in this Country,</HI> about the time of Mr Wilkes's election for Middle&s;ex, which gained me the acquaintance, and I may &s;ay the friend&s;hip, of Sir George Savile, and which I had the happine&s;s to enjoy as long as he lived.</P>
<P>At the reque&s;t al&s;o of Dr. Franklin and Dr. Fothergill, I wrote an addre&s;s to the Di&s;&s;enters on the &s;ubject of the approaching rupture with Ame|rica, a pamphlet which Sir George Savile, and my other friends, circulated in great numbers, and it was thought with &s;ome effect.</P>
<P>After this I entirely cea&s;ed to write any thing on the &s;ubject of politics, except as far as the bu|&s;ine&s;s
<PB N="xv" REF="027559_0013_0FD53520F11DC2D0">
of the <HI>Te&s;t Act,</HI> and of <HI>Civil E&s;tabli&s;hments of Religion,</HI> had a connexion with politics. And though, at the recommendation of Doctor Price, I was pre&s;ently after this taken into the family of the Marquis of Lan&s;downe, and I entered into al|mo&s;t all his views, as thinking them ju&s;t and libe|ral. I never wrote a &s;ingle political pamphler, or even a paragraph in a new&s;paper, all the time that I was with him, which was &s;even years.</P>
<P>I never preached a political &s;ermon in my life; unle&s;s &s;uch as, I believe all Di&s;&s;enters u&s;ually preach on the fifth of November, in favour of <HI>civil and religious liberty,</HI> may be &s;aid to be political. And on the&s;e occa&s;ions, I am confident, that I never ad|vanced any &s;entiment but &s;uch as, till of late years, would have tended to recommend, rather than render me obnoxious, to the&s;e who direct the ad|mini&s;tration of this country. And the doctrines which I adopted when young, and which were even popular then (except with the clergy, who were at that time generally di&s;affected to the fami|ly on the throne) I cannot abandon, merely be|cau&s;e the times are &s;o changed, that they are now become unpopular, and the expre&s;&s;ion and com|munication of them hazardous.</P>
<P><PB N="xvi" REF="027559_0014_0FD5352548E04B08">
Father, though I by no means di&s;approve of &s;ocieties for political information, &s;uch as are now every where di&s;countenanced, and generally &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed, I never was a member of any of them; nor, indeed, did I ever attend any public meeting, if I could decently avoid it, owing to habits ac|quired in &s;tudious and retired life.</P>
<P>From a mi&s;take of my talents and di&s;po&s;ition, I was invited by many of the departments in France, to repre&s;ent them in the pre&s;ent National Conven|tion, after I had been made a citizen of France, on account of my being con&s;idered as one who had been per&s;ecuted for my attachment to the cau&s;e of liberty here. But though the invitation was re|peated with the mo&s;t flattering importunity, I ne|ver he&s;itated about declining it.</P>
<P>I can farther &s;ay with re&s;pect to politics, con|cerning which I believe every Engli&s;hman has &s;ome opinion or other (and at pre&s;ent, owing to the pe|culiar nature of the pre&s;ent war, it is almo&s;t the only topic of general conver&s;ation) that, except in company, I hardly ever think of the &s;ubject, my reading, meditation, and writing, being almo&s;t wholly engro&s;&s;ed by theology, and philo&s;ophy; and of late, as for many years before the riots in Birmingham, I have &s;pent a very great proportion
<PB N="xvii" REF="027559_0015_0FD535293338F9E0">
of my time, as my friends well know, in my la|boratory.</P>
<P>If, then, my real crime has not been <HI>&s;edition,</HI> or <HI>trea&s;on,</HI> what has it been? For every <HI>effect</HI> mu&s;t have &s;ome adequate <HI>cau&s;e,</HI> and therefore the odi|um that I have incurred mu&s;t have been owing to &s;omething in my declared &s;entiments, or conduct, that has expo&s;ed me to it. In my opinion, it can|not have been any thing but my open ho&s;tility to the doctrines of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, and more e&s;pecially to all civil e&s;tabli&s;hments of religion whatever. This has brought upon me the impla|cable re&s;entment of the great body of the clergy; and they have found other methods of oppo&s;ing me be&s;ides <HI>argument,</HI> and that u&s;e of the <HI>pre&s;s</HI> which is equally open to us all. They have al&s;o found an able ally and champion in Mr Burke, who (without any provocation except that of an|&s;wering his book on the French Revolution) has taken &s;everal opportunities of inveighing again&s;t me, in a place where he knows I cannot reply to him, and from which he al&s;o knows that his ac|cu&s;ation will reach every corner of the country, and con&s;equently thou&s;ands of per&s;ons who will never read any writings of mine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Burke having &s;aid in the Hou&s;e of Commons, that <Q>I was made a citizen of France on account of my declared ho&s;tility to the con&s;titution of this country,</Q> I, in the pub|lic papers, denied the charge, and called upon him for the proofs of it. As he made no reply, I &s;aid, in the preface to my Fa&s;t Sermon of the la&s;t year, p.9, that <Q>it &s;ufficiently appeared that he had neither ability to maintain his charge, nor virtue to retract it.</Q> A year more of &s;ilence on his part having now elap&s;ed, this is become more evident than before.</NOTE> They have
<PB N="xviii" REF="027559_0016_0FD535307B256B20">
had another, and &s;till more effectual vehicle of their abu&s;e in what are called the <HI>trea&s;ury new&s;|papers,</HI> and other popular publications.</P>
<P>By the&s;e and other means, the &s;ame party &s;pirit which was the cau&s;e of the riots in Birmingham, has been increa&s;ing ever &s;ince, e&s;pecially in that neighbourhood. A remarkable in&s;tance of this may be &s;een in a <HI>Letter</HI> addre&s;&s;ed, but not &s;ent, to me from <HI>Mr. Foley, rector of Stourbridge,</HI> who acknowledges the &s;atisfaction that he and his bre|thren have received from one of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t and coar&s;e&s;t pieces of abu&s;e of me that has yet appear|ed, which, as a curious &s;pecimen of the kind, I in&s;erted in the <HI>Appendix of my Appeal,</HI> and in which I am repre&s;ented as no better than Guy Fawkes, or the devil him&s;elf. This very Chri&s;tian divine recommends to the members of the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed church to decline all commercial dealings with the Di&s;&s;enters, as an effectual method of ex|terminating them. This method has been actually adopted in many parts of England. Al&s;o great numbers of the be&s;t farmers and artizans in Eng|land have been di&s;mi&s;&s;ed becau&s;e they would not
<PB N="xix" REF="027559_0017_0FD53553384CC3DB0">
go to the e&s;tabli&s;hed church. <HI>Defoe's Shorte&s;t Way with the Di&s;&s;enters</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A tract written in a grave ironical &s;tile, advi&s;ing to hang them all.</NOTE> would have taught the friends of the church a more effectual method &s;till. And yet this Mr. Foley, whom I never &s;aw, and who could not have had any particular cau&s;e of enmity to me, had, like Mr. Madan of Birmingham, a character for liberality.

<P>Many times, by the encouragement of per&s;ons from whom better things might have been expect|ed, I have been burned in effigy along with Mr. Paine; and numberle&s;s in&s;ulting and threatening letters have been &s;ent to me from all parts of the kingdom.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In one of the&s;e I was threatened with being burned alive before a &s;low fire.</NOTE> It is not po&s;&s;ible for any man to have conducted him&s;elf more peaceably than I have done all the time that I have lived at Clapton, yet it has not exempted me not only from the wor&s;t &s;u&s;pi|cions, but very gro&s;s in&s;ults.

As nothing had been paid to me on account of damages in the riot, when I publi&s;hed the &s;econd part of my <HI>Appeal</HI> to the public on the &s;ubject, it may be proper to &s;ay, that it was paid &s;ome time in the beginning of the year 1793, with in|tere&s;t only from the fir&s;t of January of the &s;ame year, though the injury was received in July, 1791; when equity evidently required, that it ought to have been allowed from the time of the riot, e&s;|pecially as, in all the ca&s;es, the allowance was far &s;hort of the lo&s;s. In my ca&s;e of it fell &s;hort, as I have &s;hewn, not le&s;s than two thou&s;and pounds. And the lo&s;&s;es &s;u&s;tained by the other &s;ufferers far ex|ceeded mine. Public ju&s;tice al&s;o required that, if the forms of law, local enmity, or any other cau&s;e, had prevented our receiving full indemnification, it &s;hould have been made up to us from the public trea&s;ury; the great end of all civil government being protection from violence, or an indemnifi|cation for it.

I cannot refrain from repeating again, that I leave my native country with real regret, never expecting to find any where el&s;e &s;ociety &s;o &s;uited to my di&s;po&s;ition and habits, &s;uch friends as I have here (who&s;e attachment has been more than a balance to all the abu&s;e I have met with from others) and e&s;pecially to replace one particular Chri&s;tian friend, in who&s;e ab&s;ence I &s;hall, for &s;ome time at lea&s;t, find all the world a blank. Still le&s;s can I expect to re&s;ume my favourite pur&s;uits, with any thing like the advantages I enjoy here. In leaving this country I al&s;o abandon a &s;ource of maintenance, which I can but ill bear to lo&s;e. I can, however truly &s;ay, that I leave it without any re&s;entment, or ill will. On the contrary, I &s;incerely wi&s;h my countrymen all happine&s;s; and when the time for reflection (which my ab&s;ence may accele|rate) &s;hall come, my countrymen, I am confident, will do me more ju&s;tice.

In this ca&s;e, I &s;hall look with &s;atisfaction to the time when, if my life be prolonged, I may vi&s;it my friends in this country; and perhaps I may, notwith&s;tanding my removal for the pre&s;ent, find a grave (as I believe is naturally the wi&s;h of every man) in the land that gave me birth.</P>

<Q>REPENT YE, FOR THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IS AT HAND!
<BIBL><HI>Matt.</HI> iii.2.</BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS was the great burden of the preaching of both John the Bapti&s;t and of our Saviour. But as that <HI>kingdom of heaven,</HI> the approach of which they an|nounced, and which, by our Saviour's direction, is the &s;ubject of our daily prayers, is not yet come, but much nearer than it was in their time, there mu&s;t be a greater propriety in urging this exhortation at pre&s;ent, than there has ever yet been. It is nothing but repentance that can prepare &s;inful men (and all men are more or le&s;s &s;inners) to derive any advantage from this kingdom, in which Chri&s;t and the &s;aints &s;hall bear rule; that new &s;tate of the heavens and of the earth, in which <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> only <HI>will dwell.</HI> And being a &s;econd time called upon by our rulers to humble our&s;elves before God, on account of the calamities we already feel, and tho&s;e that we have rea&s;on to fear, and repentance being the only means of averting his anger, and procuring a ce&s;&s;ation, or mitiga|tion, of his heavy judgements, I &s;hall take this oppor|tunity
<PB N="28" REF="027559_0026_0FD53559D978ACF8">
of urging it, from that very critical and truly alarming &s;ituation, in which almo&s;t the whole of Europe now finds it&s;elf, and this country of ours, as having mo&s;t at &s;take, perhaps more than any other.</P>
<P>If we can learn any thing concerning what is before us, from the language of prophecy, great calamities,&s;uch as the world has never yet experienced, will pre|cede that happy &s;tate of things, in which <Q>the kingdoms of this world will become the kingdom of our Lord Je|&s;us Chri&s;t</Q> and the&s;e calamities will chiefly affect tho&s;e nations which have been the &s;eat of the great antichri&s;tian power; or, as all Prote&s;tants, and I believe ju&s;tly, &s;up|po&s;e, have been &s;ubject to the &s;ee of Rome. And it ap|pears to me highly probable, as I hinted in my la&s;t di&s;cour&s;e on this occa&s;tion, that the pre&s;ent di&s;turbances in Europe are the beginning of tho&s;e very calamitous times. I therefore think there is a call for unu&s;ual &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, and attention to the cour&s;e of Divine Providence, that when <Q>the judgements of God are abroad in the earth, the inhabitants thereof may learn righteou&s;ne&s;s,</Q> &s;o as to be prepared for whatever events the now rapid wheels of time may di&s;clo&s;e. Let us then, my brethern, make a &s;erious pau&s;e. Let us look back to the antient prophe|cies, and compare them with the pre&s;ent &s;late of things around us, and let us then look to our&s;elves, to our own &s;entiments and conduct, that we may feel and act as our peculiar circum&s;tances require.</P>
<P>The future happy &s;late of the world, when the Jews &s;hall be re&s;tored to their own country, and be at the head of all the nations of the earth, was &s;uit di&s;tinctly men|tioned by I&s;aiah, and other prophets who were nearly
<PB N="29" REF="027559_0027_0FD5355B79ABB7B8">
cotemporary with him; but it was fir&s;t denominated <HI>the kingdom of heaven,</HI> and announced as to be admini&s;tered by <HI>the Son of Man,</HI> or <HI>the Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> by Daniel. It was, however, by other prophets, given to a de&s;cendant of David. All Chri&s;tians con&s;ider Je&s;us as this de&s;cendant of David, or the promi&s;ed Me&s;&s;iah. The mi&s;take which the Jews were under, aro&s;e from their wholly overlook|ing the &s;uffering &s;tate of the Me&s;&s;iah, and imagining that his <HI>fir&s;t</HI> coming would be that mentioned by Daniel, <HI>in the clouds of heaven;</HI> and con&s;equently that this kingdom would commence on his fir&s;t appearance.</P>
<P>Je&s;us, knowing him&s;elf to be the Me&s;&s;iah, never denied that, at a proper time, he would appear as a king; nor could there have been a<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> that time any uncertainty about the meaning of the term <HI>king.</HI> When Pilate a&s;ked Je&s;us if he was a king, he acknowledged it, and added that he was &s;ent to bear witne&s;s to <HI>that,</HI> as well as to other truths; though, to obivate the jealou&s;y of Pilate, and the Roman government, he &s;aid that his kingdom was <HI>not of this world;</HI> &s;o that it did not interfere with the governments which then exi&s;ted in the world, being that <HI>kingdom of heaven</HI> which was to take place hereafter, and to be exerci&s;ed upon maxims very different from tho&s;e of the then exi&s;t|ing kingdoms.</P>
<P>Je&s;us al&s;o &s;aid that, when he &s;hould reign, his apo&s;tles would reign with him, and that they &s;hould '&s;it upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of I&s;rael.' Paul al&s;o &s;aid, that 'the &s;aints &s;hall judge the world.' And it is remarkable that, in the original prophecy of Daniel, the admini&s;tration of this kingdom of hea|ven is not &s;aid to be confined to one per&s;on, but to be
<PB N="30" REF="027559_0028_0FD5355D0A57FAD0">
extended to many, Dan. vii. 18. <Q>The &s;aints of the Mo&s;t High &s;hall take the kingdom, and po&s;&s;e&s;s the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever;</Q> ver.27. <Q>And the kingdom, and dominion, and the greatne&s;s of the king|dom, under the whole heaven, &s;hall be given to the peo|ple of the &s;aints of the Mo&s;t High, who&s;e kingdom is an everla&s;ting kingdom, and all dominion &s;hall &s;erve, and obey him,</Q> or rather, 'obey <HI>it.'</HI></P>
<P>That this will be a proper <HI>kingdom,</HI> though a kingdom of righteou&s;ne&s;s, the object of which will be the happi|ne&s;s of the &s;ubjects of it, is farther evident from the other kingdoms which are to be overthrown in order to make way for it. For had it been that purely <HI>&s;piritual kingdom</HI> which &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e, what occa&s;ion was there for the de|&s;truction of the other kingdoms; &s;ince they would not have interfered with it, but might have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted at the &s;ame time?</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t vi&s;ion of Nebuchadnezzar, interpreted by Daniel, this future, kingdom of heaven is repre&s;ented by 'a little &s;tone, cut out of a mountain without hands,' which <HI>&s;mote</HI> the image repre&s;enting the preceding king|doms, Dan. ii. 34. and 'brake it to pieces,' when it&s;elf 'became a great mountain, filling the whole earth.' In the interpretation of this vi&s;ion, ver. 44, it is &s;aid, <Q>In the days of the&s;e kings &s;hall the God of heaven &s;et up a kingdom which &s;hall never be de&s;troyed, and the king|dom &s;hall not be left to other people, but it &s;hall break in pieces, and con&s;ume all the&s;e kingdoms, and it &s;hall &s;tand for ever;</Q> evidently in the place of the other king|doms. It is, therefore, an in&s;titution adapted to an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of them, but in a much better manner.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="027559_0029_0FD5355F0B1612E0">
This kingdom, however, a kingdom of truth and righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, will not be e&s;tabli&s;hed without the greate&s;t convul&s;ions, and the violent overthrow of other king|doms. Every de&s;cription, figurative or otherwi&s;e, of this great revolution, clearly implies violence, and con&s;e|quently great calamity. The little &s;tone <HI>&s;miling</HI> the image, and <HI>breaking it in pieces,</HI> is far from giving an idea of a peaceable revolution, but one that will be effected with great violence, and in a &s;hort time. The following lan|guage is peculiarly emphatical. <Q>Then was the iron, the clay, the bra&s;s, the &s;ilver, and the gold,</Q>(all the materials of which the image con&s;i&s;ted) <Q>broken to pieces together, and became as the chaff of the &s;ummer floor, and the wind carried them away, and no place was found for them; and the &s;tone that &s;mote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.</Q> In the interpretation it is &s;aid, ver. 44. <Q>that this new kingdom &s;hall break in pieces, and con&s;ume all the other kingdom.</Q></P>
<P>The &s;ame awful conclu&s;ion may be drawn from the language u&s;ed in the corre&s;ponding vi&s;ion of Daniel him|&s;elf, in the fir&s;t year of Bel&s;hazzar, in which the four great empires, which in Nebuchadnezzar's dream had been repre&s;ented by the <HI>four metals,</HI> of which the image that he &s;aw con&s;i&s;ted, are repre&s;ented by <HI>four bea&s;ts.</HI> and the la&s;t of them is &s;aid (Dan. vii. 11.)not to die a natural death, but <HI>to be &s;tain,</HI> and moreover, his <HI>body de&s;troyed, and given to the burning flame.</HI> As, in the former vi&s;ion, the ten kingdoms, into which the la&s;t, or the Roman em|pire was to be divided, were repre&s;ented by the ten toes of the image; in this vi&s;ion of Daniel they are repre&s;ented
<PB N="32" REF="027559_0030_0FD5356296D6C570">
by the ten horns of the la&s;t bea&s;t. The&s;e are &s;aid to be ten kingdoms, or thrones, and the&s;e thrones are &s;aid to be <HI>ca&s;t down,</HI> Dan. vii. 9. clearly implying violence in their di&s;&s;olution.</P>
<P>In the language of prophecy, great, and e&s;pecially &s;ud|den revolutions, in kingdoms and &s;tates, are frequently repre&s;ented by <HI>earthquakes;</HI> and al&s;o the &s;upreme powers on earth by the &s;un, moon, and &s;tars in heaven. And, in agreement with the preceding view, &s;ugge&s;ted by Daniel, the prophet Haggai, who wrote after him, to comfort his countrymen in their low and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed circum&s;tances, and gloomy pro&s;pects, when they were erecting a poor and contemptible temple, compared with that of Solomon, a&s;&s;ures them, that the glory of the <HI>latter hou&s;e,</HI> (meaning, I am per&s;uaded, not the hou&s;e they were then building, for that was taken down by Herod; nor yet that of He|rod, but the <HI>la&s;t</HI> hou&s;e, the glorious temple de&s;cribed by Ezekiel, as to be built after the return of the Jews to their own country) &s;hould be greater than that of the former hou&s;e built by Solomon. Haggai de&s;cribes the great revolution that is to precede it in the following manner. Hagg. ii. 6. <Q>For thus &s;aith the Lord of Ho&s;ts, Yet once it is a little while, and I will &s;hake the heavens and the earth, and the &s;ea, and the dry land, and I will &s;hake all nations, and the de&s;ire of all nations &s;hall come, and I will fill this hou&s;e with glory, &s;aith the Lord of Ho&s;ts. The glory of this latter hou&s;e &s;hall be greater than that of the former, &s;aith the Lord of Ho&s;ts; and in this place will I give peace, &s;aith the Lord of Ho&s;ts.</Q> What can be this <HI>peace,</HI> but the future peace|ful and happy &s;tate of the world under the Me&s;&s;iah? and
<PB N="33" REF="027559_0031_0FD535675B4A38A8">
what can be this <HI>&s;haking of the nations,</HI> that is to precede it, but great convul&s;ions, and &s;udden revolutions, &s;uch as we &s;ee now beginning to take place?</P>
<P>The la&s;t great power that is foretold, as to ari&s;e among the ten kingdoms into which the Roman empire is to be divided, is repre&s;ented by the <HI>little horn,</HI> which is &s;aid to ari&s;e after the ten, &s;ignifying, I doubt not, the Papal power. It is &s;aid, Dan. vii. 20, <Q>to have eyes, and a mouth that &s;pake very great things, who&s;e look was more &s;tout than his fellows, which made war with the &s;aints, and prevailed again&s;t them, until the antient of days came, and judgment was given to the &s;aints of the Mo&s;t High, and the time came that the &s;aints po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed the kingdom.</Q> This power, in the interpretation of the vi&s;ion, is &s;aid to be one that &s;hould <Q>&s;peak great words again&s;t the Mo&s;t High, and to wear out the &s;aints of the Mo&s;t High, and to think to change times and laws.</Q> It is added, <Q>They &s;hall be given into his hand until a time, and times, and the dividing of time,</Q> the very period for the duration of the great antichri&s;tian power in the Revelation.</P>
<P>When the termination of this la&s;t power is de&s;cribed, it is &s;aid, ver. 26, <Q>The judgment &s;hall &s;it, and they &s;hall take away his dominion, to con&s;ume and to de&s;troy it unto the end,</Q> which clearly implies nothing of a peace|able nature, but &s;omething exceedingly violent and cala|mitous.</P>
<P>This is, no doubt, the &s;ame awful period that is &s;poken of in the la&s;t chapter of Daniel, ch. xii. ver. 1. <Q>And at that time &s;hall Michael &s;tand up, the great prince which
<PB N="34" REF="027559_0032_0FD5356DECBE8760">

And many of them that &s;leep in the du&s;t of the earth &s;hall awake.</Q> For that the re&s;urrection, at lea&s;t in part, will take place at the commencement of this great period, is agreeable to the uniform language of &s;cripture on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>All the prophecies in the New Te&s;tament concerning the fall of antichri&s;t, and the commencement of the pro|per kingdom of heaven, and of Chri&s;t, exactly corre&s;pond with tho&s;e which I have quoted from the Old Te&s;tament. The &s;econd coming of Chri&s;t is repre&s;ented by the apo&s;tle Paul, 2 The&s;. i. 7, as an event exceedingly awful, and dreadful to the wicked. <Q>He will be revealed from hea|ven, with his mighty angels, in flaming fire, taking ven|geance on them that know not God.</Q></P>
<P>That the great antichri&s;tian power is to be de&s;troyed at this &s;econd coming of Chri&s;t, and not properly before, and therefore that its final de&s;truction will be &s;udden, is evident from what the &s;ame apo&s;tle &s;ays afterwards, 2 The&s;. ii. 8. <Q>Then &s;hall that wicked one be revealed, whom the Lord &s;hall con&s;ume with the &s;pirit of his mouth, and &s;hall de&s;troy with the brightne&s;s of his coming, even him who&s;e coming is after the working of Satan, with all power, and &s;igns, and lying wonders, and with all deceivablene&s;s of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, in them that peri&s;h;</Q> characters &s;ufficiently evident of the church of Rome.</P>

The account that is given, in the book of Revelation, of the commencement of the la&s;t great period, &s;ignified by the blowing of the <HI>&s;eventh trumpet,</HI> when the king|doms of the earth are to become the kingdoms of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, Rev. ii. 15, is immediately preceded by the third, and probably far the greate&s;t of the <HI>three woes,</HI> the fir&s;t of which was occa&s;ioned by the conque&s;ts of the Saracens, and the &s;econd by tho&s;e of the Turks, as the order of the events de&s;cribed under the preceding trumpets evidently implies. And the &s;tate of things at this time is de&s;cribed in the following emphatical language of the four and twenty elders, who are &s;aid, on this occa&s;i|on, to fall on their faces, and to wor&s;hip God, Rev. xi. 17. <Q>We give thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, who art, and wa&s;t, and art to come, becau&s;e thou ha&s;t taken to thee thy great power and ha&s;t reigned. And the na|tions were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead that they mu&s;t be judged, and that thou &s;houlde&s;t give reward to thy &s;ervants the prophets, and &s;houlde&s;t de&s;troy them that de&s;troy the earth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On this &s;ubject I refer my readers to two &s;ermons lately pub|li&s;hed by the Rev.

<P>We have here a wonderful concurrence of great events, and among the&s;e is the <HI>anger of the nations,</HI> followed by the <HI>de&s;truction of them that have de&s;troyed the earth.</HI> Now how has the earth been de&s;troyed by the men who <HI>have</HI> de&s;troyed it, but by de&s;olating wars, and the de&s;truction that has thereby been made of mankind? In like manner, then, may we conclude that tho&s;e de&s;tructive powers will them&s;elves be de&s;troyed, probably by one another, in
<PB N="36" REF="027559_0034_0FD535720131F438">
tho&s;e <HI>wars</HI> which the apo&s;tle James &s;ays ari&s;e from <HI>men's lu&s;ts,</HI> the lu&s;t of ambition and revenge. And when, my brethren, have we &s;een, or heard of, &s;uch anger and range in nations, &s;uch violence in carrying on war, and &s;uch de|&s;truction of men, as at this very time? It is thought that the la&s;t campaign only has de&s;troyed many more men than all the eight years of the American war, and probably more than the long war before it; and from the increa&s;ed armaments of the belligerent powers, and their increa&s;ing animo&s;ity, it is probable that the approaching campaign will be more bloody than the la&s;t.</P>
<P>What has more eminently contributed to de&s;troy the earth, than the antichri&s;tian and idolatrous eccle&s;ia&s;tical e&s;tabli&s;hments of Chri&s;tianity, that have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in the&s;e we&s;tern parts of the world; many more per&s;ons having been de&s;troyed by Chri&s;tians, as they have called them|&s;elves, than by Heathens? And do we not &s;ee one, and one of the principal, of tho&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hments already, and completely, de&s;troyed?</P>
<P>A more highly wrought picture of the de&s;truction and &s;laughter of men, that will precede this glorious period in which 'God will take to him&s;elf his great power and reign,' we find in the 19th chapter of the Revelation, which de&s;cribes the triumph of the &s;aints on the occa&s;ion. <Q>After the&s;e things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, &s;aying, Alleluia, Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, unto the Lord our God; for true and right are his judgments. For he hath judged the great who&s;e, which did corrupt the earth with her for|nication, and hath avenged the blood of his &s;ervants at her hand.</Q> That this has a connexion with the &s;econd
<PB N="37" REF="027559_0035_0FD535752979D410">
coming of Chri&s;t, appears from what immediately follows, ver. II. <Q>And I &s;aw heaven opened, and behold a white hor&s;e, and he that &s;at upon him was called faithful and true, and in righteou&s;ne&s;s he &s;hall judge and make war. His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns, and he had a name written which no man knew but he him&s;elf. And he was clothed in a ve&s;ture dipped in blood, and his name is called THE WORD OF GOD. And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white hor&s;es, clothed in fine linen, white and clean; and out of his mouth goeth a &s;harp &s;word, that with it he &s;hould &s;mite the nations; and he &s;hall rule them with a rod of iron, and he treadeth the wine-pre&s;s of the fiercene&s;s of the wrath of Almighty God. And he hath on his ve&s;ture, and on his thigh, a name written, KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.</Q></P>
<P>That there will be literally great &s;laughter of men on the occa&s;ion, is clearly indicated in what follows, figurative and hyperbolical as the language is, ver. 17. <Q>And I &s;aw an angel &s;tanding in the &s;un, and he cried with a loud voice, &s;aying to all the fowls that fly in the mid&s;t of heaven, Come and gather your&s;elves together, unto the &s;upper of the great God, that ye may eat the fle&s;h of kings, and the fle&s;h of captains; and the fle&s;h of mighty men, and the fle&s;h of hor&s;es, and them that &s;it on them, and the fle&s;h of all men, both free and bond, both &s;mall and great.</Q></P>
<P>The &s;ame is evident from the account of the pouring out of the third vial, Rev. xvi. 14, &amp;c. <Q>And the third angel poured out his vial on the rivers and fountains of water, and they became blood. And I heard the angel
<PB N="38" REF="027559_0036_0FD53576B89A0D20">
of the waters, &s;ay, Thou art righteous, O Lord, who art, and wa&s;t, and &s;halt be, becau&s;e thou ha&s;t judged thus. For they have &s;hed the blood of &s;aints and prophets, and thou ha&s;t given them blood to drink, for they are worthy.</Q></P>
<P>That this great &s;laughter will be made on the de&s;truc|tion of the antichri&s;tian power, called in this book <HI>the bea&s;t,</HI> &s;upported by <HI>the kings of the earth,</HI> is evident from the next ver&s;es, ver. 19. <Q>And I &s;aw the bea&s;t, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together, to make war again&s;t him that &s;at on the hor&s;e, and again&s;t his army. And the bea&s;t was taken, and with him the fal&s;e prophet, that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the bea&s;t, and them that wor&s;hipped his image. The&s;e were both ca&s;t alive into a lake of fire burning with brim&s;tone. And the remnant were &s;tain with the &s;word of him that &s;at upon the hor&s;e, which &s;word proceeded out of his mouth, and all the &s;owls were filled with their fle&s;h.</Q></P>
<P>After this follows the de&s;cription of the millenium, chap. xx. ver. 4. <Q>And I &s;aw thrones and they &s;at upon them, and judgment was given unto them; and I &s;aw the &s;ouls of them that were beheaded for the witne&s;s of Je&s;us, and for the word of God, and which had not wor&s;hipped the bea&s;t, neither his image, neither had re|ceived his mark upon their forehead, or in their hands, and they lived and reigned with Chri&s;t a thou&s;and years. But the re&s;t of the dead lived not again until the thou&s;and years were fini&s;hed. This is the fir&s;t re&s;urrection. Ble&s;&s;ed and holy is he that hath part in the fir&s;t re&s;ur|rection. On &s;uch the &s;econd death hath no power, but

they &s;hall be prie&s;ts of God, and of Chri&s;t, and they &s;hall reign with him a thou&s;and years.</Q></P>
<P>To me it appears not improbable, that &s;everal circum|&s;tances in our Saviour's prophecy concerning the de&s;truc|tion of Jeru&s;alem, and the de&s;olation of Judea, relate to this great and more di&s;tant period. For it was delivered in an&s;wer to a que&s;tion put to him by his di&s;ciples, which re&s;pected both the events, on the idea of their being coin|cident. 'Tell us,' &s;ay they, Matt. xxiv. 3, <Q>When &s;hall the&s;e things be, and what &s;hall be the &s;ign of thy coming, and of the end of the age?</Q> In an&s;wer to this, he &s;ays, fir&s;t, as it is in Luke, who&s;e account in this ca&s;e &s;eems to be the mo&s;t orderly and di&s;tinct of any, chap. xxi. ver. 9. <Q>But when ye &s;hall hear of wars, and com|motions, be not terrified; for the&s;e things mu&s;t fir&s;t come to pa&s;s, but the end is not by and by. Then &s;aid he unto them, Nation &s;hall ri&s;e again&s;t nation, and king|dom again&s;t kingdom, and great earthquakes &s;hall be in divers places, and famines, and pe&s;tilences, and fear|ful &s;ights, and great &s;igns &s;hall there be from heaven. But before all the&s;e they &s;hall lay their hands on you, and per&s;ecute you, delivering you up to the &s;ynagogues, and into pri&s;ons, being brought before kings and rulers for my names &s;ake.</Q></P>
<P>I am the more inclined to think that &s;ome things in this prediction have this farther reference, becau&s;e in them Je&s;us expre&s;sly quotes the language of Daniel recited above, which unque&s;tionably has this reference; as when he &s;ays, Mat. xxix. 20. <Q>There &s;hall be great tribula|tion, &s;uch as was not &s;ince the beginning of the world to this time, no nor ever &s;hall be: And except tho&s;e
<PB N="40" REF="027559_0038_0FD5357B11610538">
days &s;hould be &s;hortened, there &s;hould no fle&s;h be &s;aved, but for the elects &s;ake tho&s;e days &s;hall be &s;hortened.</Q></P>
<P>It &s;eems &s;till more evident that this prediction admits of this interpretation, from what follows, which exactly corre&s;ponds to the more antient prophecies. Mat. xxiv. 29. <Q>Immediately after the tribulation of tho&s;e days &s;hall the &s;un be darkened, and the moon not give her light, and the &s;tars &s;hall fall from heaven, and the pow|ers of the heavens &s;hall be &s;haken;</Q> which are almo&s;t the very words of the prophet Haggai quoted above. <Q>And then &s;hall appear the &s;ign of the Son of Man in heaven. And then &s;hall all the tribes of the earth mourn. And they &s;hall &s;ee the Son of Man coming in the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory. And he &s;hall &s;end his angels with a great &s;ound of a trumpet, and they &s;hall gather together his elect, from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.</Q></P>
<P>That this great tribulation was a di&s;tant event, and did not re&s;pect the Jews, but the Gentiles, is probable from Je&s;us calling it, Luke xxi. 25, 'the di&s;tre&s;s of nations,' or 'the nations,' i.e. 'Gentiles,' 'men's hearts,' he &s;ubjoins, <Q>failing them for fear, and for looking after tho&s;e things which are coming on the earth. For the powers of heaven &s;hall be &s;haken,</Q> that is, there will be great convul&s;ions, and violent revolutions, in kingdoms and &s;tates; <Q>And then &s;hall they &s;ee the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> Man coming in clouds, with power and great glory.</Q></P>
<P>That this tribulation is coincident with that which is to precede the re&s;toration of the Jews, is probable from his &s;aying immediately before, ver. 24. <Q>Jeru&s;alem &s;hall
<PB N="41" REF="027559_0039_0FD535810171EF20">
be trodden down of the Gentiles, till the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled,</Q> that is, till it &s;hall come to be their turn to be puni&s;hed; the de&s;truction of the Gentiles, who had oppre&s;&s;ed the Jews, commencing with the re|&s;toration of that highly favoured nation.</P>
<P>Je&s;us farther &s;ays, Luke xxi. 22. <Q>The&s;e be the days of vengeance, that all the things which are written may be fulfilled</Q> Now the only days of vengeance particularly announced by the antient prophets, to which Je&s;us here alludes, relate to the judgments of God upon the Gen|tiles who had &s;hewn enmity to the Jews, and e&s;pecially in their oppo&s;ition to their re-&s;ettlement in their own country.</P>
<P>There is nothing more clear in the whole compa&s;s of prophecy, as I have &s;hewn on another occa&s;ion, than that after the de&s;tined period for the di&s;per&s;ion and calamities of the Jews, the heavie&s;t of all the divine judgments will fall upon tho&s;e nations by whom they &s;hall have been op|pre&s;&s;ed; and this will involve almo&s;t all the nations of the world, but more e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the&s;e we&s;tern parts, which have been &s;ubject fir&s;t to the Roman em|pire, and then to the &s;ee of Rome.</P>

<P>That there is to be a day of vi&s;itation for all the nations in this part of the world (all of whom have di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by their oppre&s;&s;ion and ma&s;&s;acre of the Jews) will now, I pre&s;ume, be &s;ufficiently apparent, if there be any truth in prophecy.

<P>That tho&s;e great troubles, &s;o frequently mentioned in the antient prophecies, are now commencing, I do own I &s;trongly &s;u&s;pect, as I intimated the la&s;t time that I ad|dre&s;&s;ed you on this occa&s;ion; and the events of the la&s;t year have contributed to &s;trengthen that &s;u&s;picion; the &s;torm, however, may &s;till blow over for the pre&s;ent, and the great &s;cene of calamity be re&s;erved for &s;ome future time, though I cannot think it will be deferred long.</P>

As to the preci&s;e time when the &s;cene of calamity will terminate, and the proper kingdom of Chri&s;t will com|mence, he him&s;elf did not know, either before his death and re&s;urrection, or afterwards. When he was que&s;|tioned on the &s;ubject, he expre&s;sly &s;aid, Mark xiii. 32, <Q>But of that day, and that hour, knoweth no man, no not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.</Q> When, after his re&s;urrection, the di&s;ci|ples a&s;ked him, &s;aying, Acts i. 6, <Q>Lord, wilt thou at this time re&s;tore again the kingdom to I&s;rael?</Q> he re|plied, <Q>It is not for you to know the times or the &s;ea&s;ons, which the Father hath put in his own power.</Q> It is enough for us to know the certainty of the&s;e great events, that our faith may not fail on the approach of the pre|dicted calamity, confident that it will have the happie&s;t i&s;&s;ue in God's own time. For the &s;ame Being who fore|told the evil which we &s;hall &s;ee come to pa&s;s, has likewi&s;e foretold the good that is to follow it.</P>
<P>That the &s;econd coming of Chri&s;t will be coincident with the commencement of the millenium, or the future peaceable and happy &s;tate of the world (which, according to all the prophecies, will take place after the re&s;toration of the Jews) is evident from what Peter &s;aid, in his ad|dre&s;s to the Jews, on the occa&s;ion of his healing the lame man at the gate of the temple, Acts iii. 19. <Q>Re|pent ye, therefore, and be converted, that your &s;ins may be blotted out, when the times of refre&s;hing &s;hall come from the pre&s;ence of the Lord. And he &s;hall &s;end Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who before was preached unto you, whom the heavens mu&s;t receive until the times of the re&s;titution of all things, which God hath &s;poken by the mouth of all his holy prophets &s;ince the world began.</Q> Now
<PB N="44" REF="027559_0042_0FD5358B79BE0350">
nothing is more evident than that the only period that can be called the time of the <HI>re&s;titution of all things,</HI> or the paradi&s;iacal and happy &s;tate of the world, foretold by the antient prophets, will follow the re&s;toration of the Jews to their own country. This, and nothing el&s;e, is the great burden of all antient prophecy.</P>
<P>That this will be a joyful event to the Jewi&s;h nation, when they will be convinced, perhaps by his per&s;onal ap|pearance among them, that he is their promi&s;ed Me&s;&s;iah, actually coming in the clouds of heaven, appears from what our Saviour him&s;elf &s;ays, Mat. xxi. 9. Luke xiii. 35. <Q>Verily I &s;ay unto you, ye &s;hall not &s;ee me until the time come when ye &s;hall &s;ay, Ble&s;&s;ed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord;</Q> the very cry at which the Scribes and Phari&s;ees were &s;o much offended in the children, when Je&s;us entered Jeru&s;alem. This very cry would then be that of the whole nation.</P>
<P>But though our Saviour could not fix the time of his &s;econd coming, or the commencement of his proper king|dom, he &s;ufficiently forewarned his di&s;ciples of the &s;igns of its approach, and of &s;ome circum&s;tances that will im|mediately precede it, to which it certainly behoves us to be attentive.</P>
<P>Before this great event the go&s;pel is to be preached to all the world. Mat. xxiv. 14. <Q>And this go&s;pel of the kingdom &s;hall be preached through all the world, for a witne&s;s to all nations, and then &s;hall the end come.</Q> If by the whole world, we mean the Roman empire, this was accompli&s;hed before the de&s;truction of Jeru&s;alem, and therefore may refer to that event. But it may have
<PB N="45" REF="027559_0043_0FD5358D1BDD29D8">
a farther reference, and now there is hardly any nation that has not had an opportunity of having the go&s;pel preached to them; and the late wonderful exten&s;ion of navigation, by which the whole of the habitable world has been explored by Chri&s;tians (though this was by no means the object of the navigators) will, no doubt, be the means of carrying the knowledge of the go&s;pel to a greater extent than ever; and the troubles of Europe will greatly contribute to the &s;ame end. Times of trou|ble make men &s;erious. With the&s;e &s;erious impre&s;&s;ions on their minds many will fly to di&s;tant countries, and carry the knowledge of the go&s;pel with them; and, it may be hoped, in greater purity, and con&s;equently more worthy of their acceptance, than it has hitherto appeared to them.</P>
<P>Another preceding event, and of a more definite kind, is the great prevalence of infidelity, Luke xviii.8. <Q>When the Son of Man cometh, &s;hall he find faith in the earth.</Q> Now the prevalence of infidelity of late years has been very remarkable in all countries in which antichri&s;tian hierarchies have been e&s;tabli&s;hed. And certainly all civil e&s;tabli&s;hments of Chri&s;tianity, in which power is claimed to pre&s;cribe articles of faith, to make laws to bind the con&s;ciences of Chri&s;tians, and inflict temporal puni&s;h|ments for the violation of them, are properly antichri&s;t|ian. For, as Chri&s;tians, we are commanded to acknow|ledge no man ma&s;ter upon earth, &s;ince one is our ma&s;ter, even Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Moreover, &s;uch ab&s;urd doctrines have been e&s;tabli&s;hed by human authority, and &s;uch horrid puni&s;hments have been inflicted upon men for obeying the dictates of con|&s;cience,
<PB N="46" REF="027559_0044_0FD535900FC68748">
under all tho&s;e hierarchies, prote&s;tant ones not excepted, that the minds of men have revolted at them; and, &s;hocked at &s;uch enormities, have thrown off the be|lief and profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity altogether. This was long ago the ca&s;e in Italy, where the enormities of the court of Rome were the mo&s;t con&s;picuous; and many of the cardinals, and &s;ome of the popes them&s;elves, are well known to have been unbelivers.</P>
<P>That this has long been the ca&s;e in France, is what no per&s;on acquainted with that country the la&s;t fifty years will deny. It is now become more generally known, be|cau&s;e it has had a better opportunity of &s;howing it&s;elf. That, in &s;imilar circum&s;tances, the &s;ame, or &s;omething ap|proaching to it, would not appear to be the ca&s;e with <HI>us,</HI> is more than tho&s;e who are acquainted with the &s;tate of things in this re&s;pect will vouch for.</P>
<P>When I was my&s;elf in France in 1774, I &s;aw &s;ufficient rea&s;on to believe, that hardly any per&s;on of eminence, in church or &s;tate, and e&s;pecially in the lea&s;t degree eminent in philo&s;ophy, or literature, (who&s;e opinions in all coun|tries are, &s;ooner or later, adopted by others) were be|lievers in Chri&s;tianity; and no per&s;on will &s;uppo&s;e that there has been any change in favour of Chri&s;tianity the la&s;t twenty years. A per&s;on, I believe not living, and one of the be&s;t informed men in the country, a&s;&s;ured me, very gravely, that (paying me a compliment) I was the fir&s;t per&s;on he had ever, met with, of who&s;e under&s;tand|ing he had any opinion, who pretended to believe Chri&s;t|ianity. To this all the company a&s;&s;ented. And not only were the philo&s;ophers, and other leading men in France, at that time unbelievers in Chri&s;tianity, or dei&s;ts, but

<HI>athei&s;ts,</HI> denying the being of a God. Nay Voltaire him|&s;elf, who was then living, was con&s;idered by them as a weak-minded man, becau&s;e, though an unbeliever in revelation, he believed in a God.</P>
<P>When I a&s;ked the&s;e gentlemen what it was that appeared to them &s;o incredible in Chri&s;tianity, that they rejected it without farther examination (for they did not pretend to have employed much time on the &s;ubject) they mentioned the doctrines of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, and the trinity, as things too palpably ab&s;urd to require any di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. It is, without, doubt, the civil e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;uch Chri&s;ti|anity as this, at which the common &s;en&s;e of mankind will ever revolt, that makes &s;o many unbelievers of per&s;ons who will not take the trouble to read the &s;criptures for them&s;elves, or who have been &s;o long put upon them. The&s;e &s;y&s;tems, and the blindne&s;s and ob&s;tinacy in the governing powers, in rejecting every propo&s;al for re|forming the mo&s;t palpable abu&s;es, and the mo&s;t manife&s;t oppre&s;&s;ions, make unbelievers much fa&s;ter than all ra|tional Chri&s;tians can unmake them.</P>
<P>Nothing, however, can ever counteract the fatal influ|ence of &s;uch corrupt Chri&s;tianity, as is &s;upported by the&s;e hierarchies, which are al&s;o intolerbaly expen&s;ive and op|pre&s;&s;ive, but the exhibition of rational Chri&s;tianity, with its proper evidence, by unitartian Chri&s;tians. But the&s;e are yet &s;o few, compared with the bulk of Chri&s;tians, who are trinitarians, that &s;uperficial ob&s;ervers, as unbe|lieve's in general who judge by the great ma&s;s are, pay little regard to their repre&s;entations.</P>

Happily, this infidelity is, in its turn, de&s;troying tho&s;e antichri&s;tian e&s;tabli&s;hments which gave birth to it; and and when this great revolution &s;hall be accompli&s;hed, genuine unadulterated Chri&s;tianity, meeting with le&s;s ob|&s;truction, will not fail to recommend and e&s;tabli&s;h it&s;elf by its own evidence, and become the religion of the whole world. True Chri&s;tianity &s;tands in no need of the aid of civil power.</P>
<P>This was the idea of the great Sir I&s;aac Newton, as ap|pears from the evidence of the excellent Mr Whi&s;ton, in the following pa&s;&s;age of his <HI>E&s;&s;ay on the Revelation,</HI>2d edition, p.321. <Q>Sir I&s;aac Newton had a very &s;agaci|ous conjecture, which he told Dr. Clarke, from whom I received it, that the overbearing tyranny and per&s;ecu|ting power of the antichri&s;tian party, which hath &s;o long corrupted Chri&s;tianity, and en&s;laved the Chri&s;tian world, mu&s;t be put a &s;top to, and broken to pieces by the prevalence of infidelity, for &s;ome time, before pri|mitive Chri&s;tianity could be re&s;tored; which &s;eems to be the very means that is now working in Europe, for the &s;ame good and great end of Providence. Po&s;&s;ibly he might think that our Saviour's own words implied it: When the Son of Man cometh &s;hall he find faith on the earth? Luke xviii.8. See Con&s;titut. Ap<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">. vi. 18; vii. view.32; or po&s;&s;ibly he might think no other way &s;o likely to do it in human affairs: it being, I acknowledge|ledge, too &s;adly evident, that there is not at pre&s;ent re|ligion enough in Chri&s;tendom, to put a &s;top to &s;uch antichri&s;tian tyranny and per&s;ecution, upon any genuine principles of Chri&s;tianity.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="027559_0047_0FD5359A960F5AA8">
The concluding ob&s;ervation of Mr. Whi&s;ton appears to me to be very ju&s;t. It &s;eems probable that no Chri&s;tians, not even the free&s;t, and bolde&s;t, would ever have done what was nece&s;&s;ary to be done, to the overturning of the&s;e corrupt e&s;tabli&s;hments of Chri&s;tianity, and what unbe|lievers have lately done in France.</P>
<P>This great event of the late revolution in France ap|pears to me, and many others, to be not improbably the accompli&s;hment of the following part of the Revelation, chap. xi.3. <Q>And the &s;ame hour, there was a great earth|quake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were &s;lain of men (or literally, <HI>names of men</HI>) &s;even thou&s;and, and the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to God.</Q></P>
<P>An earthquake, as I have ob&s;erved, may &s;ignify a great convul&s;ion, and revolution, in &s;tates; and as the Papal dominions were divided into ten parts, one of which, and one of the principal of them, was France, it is pro|perly called <HI> a tenth part of the city,</HI> or of the my&s;tical <HI>Babylon.</HI> And if by <HI>names of men,</HI> we under&s;tand their <HI>titles,</HI> &s;uch as tho&s;e of the nobility, and other hereditary di&s;tinctions, all of which are now aboli&s;hed, the accom|pli&s;hment of the prediction will appear to be wonderfully exact. It is farther remarkable, that this pa&s;&s;age imme|diately precedes what I have quoted before concerning the <HI>nations being angry,</HI> and the wrath of God being come, for the <HI>de&s;truction of tho&s;e who have de&s;troyed the earth.</HI></P>
<P>It is no le&s;s remarkable, that the kings of France were tho&s;e who gave the Popes their temporalities, and the rank they now hold among the princes of the world.
<PB N="50" REF="027559_0048_0FD5359C462935A0">
And it is foretold, Rev. xvii. 16, that <Q>tho&s;e kings who gave their power and &s;trength unto the bea&s;t, &s;hall hate the whore, and &s;hall make her de&s;olate and naked, and &s;hall eat her fle&s;h, and burn her with fire. For God has put it in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to agree to give their kingdoms unto the bea&s;t, until the words of God &s;hall be fulfilled.</Q></P>
<P>May we not hence conclude it to be highly proba|ble, that what has taken place in France will be done in other countries? But the total de&s;truction of this great antichri&s;tian power &s;eems to be re&s;erved for the &s;econd coming of Chri&s;t in per&s;on, by the <HI>brightne&s;s of who&s;e ap|pearance,</HI> and not before, he is, according to the apo&s;tle Paul, to be completely <HI>de&s;troyed.</HI> And with this view, as well as others, every Prote&s;tant Chri&s;tian &s;hould &s;ay, 'Come, Lord Je&s;us, come quickly.' In the mean time, let us attend to the &s;olemn admonition in the Revelation, xviii. 4. <Q>I heard a voice from heaven, &s;aying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her &s;ins, and that ye receive not of her plagues. For her &s;ins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remem|bered her iniquities<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That the opinion here advanced, concerning the danger of the civil powers of Europe, in con&s;equence of their connexion with antichri&s;tian eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;y&s;tems, has been long entertained by me, may appear from the following extract from my <HI>Hi&s;tory of the Cor|ruptions of Chri&s;tianity,</HI> vol. ii. P. 484. <Q>It is nothing but the alliance of the kingdom of Chri&s;t with the kingdoms of this world (an alliance which our Lord him&s;elf expre&s;sly di&s;claimed) that &s;upports the gro&s;&s;e&s;t corruptions of Chri&s;tianity; and per|haps we mu&s;t wait for the fall of the civil powers before this mo&s;t unnatural alliance be broken. Calamitous, no doubt, will that time be. But what convul&s;ion in the political world ought to be &s;ubject of lamentation, if it be attended with &s;o de&s;irable an event? May the kingdom of God, and of Chri&s;t, (that which I conceive to be intended in the Lord's Prayer) truly and fully come, though all the kingdoms of the world be removed in order to make way for it.</Q></NOTE>.</Q></P>

As the &s;econd coming of Chri&s;t will be during the gene|ral prevalence of in&s;idelity, &s;o it will be &s;udden, and mo&s;t unexpected. This is the language of our Saviour him&s;elf, Mat. xxiv. 37. <Q>As the days of Noah were, &s;o &s;hall the coming of the Son of Man be. For as in the days before the flood, they were eating, and drinking, marrying, and giving in marriage, unto the day that Noah entered into the ark, and knew not till the flood came, and took them all away, &s;o &s;hall al&s;o the coming of the Son of Man be.</Q> Luke xvii. 28. <Q>Likewi&s;e, al&s;o as it was in the days of Lot. They did eat, they drank, they bought, they &s;old, they planted, they builded. But the &s;ame day that Lot went out of Sodom, he rained fire and brim&s;tone from heaven, and de&s;troyed them all. Even thus &s;hall it be when the Son of Man is revealed.</Q> The apo&s;tle Paul al&s;o &s;ays, 1 The&s;. v. 2. <Q>Your&s;elves know perfectly, that the day of the Lord &s;o cometh as a thief in the night. For when they &s;hall &s;ay peace and &s;afety, then &s;udden de|&s;truction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child, and they &s;hall not e&s;cape.</Q></P>
<P>But &s;udden and unexpected as the coming of Chri&s;t will be, it will be mo&s;t con&s;picuous. Speaking of his re|turn, he &s;ays, Mat. xxiv. 26. <Q>If they &s;hall &s;ay unto you, Behold he</Q> (i.e. the Me&s;&s;iah.) <Q>is in the de&s;ert, go not forth. Behold he is in the &s;ecret chambers, believe it not. For as the lightning cometh out of the ea&s;t, and &s;hineth even unto the we&s;t, &s;o &s;hall al&s;o the coming of

the Son of Man be.</Q> As the a&s;cent of Je&s;us was con&s;pi|cuous, and probably lei&s;urely, &s;o will be his de&s;cent. While the di&s;ciples were viewing him as he a&s;cended, we read, Acts i. 10, <Q>two men &s;tood by them in white appa|rel, who al&s;o &s;aid, Ye men of Galilee, why &s;tand ye gazing up into heaven? This &s;ame Je&s;us, who is taken from you into heaven, &s;hall &s;o come in like manner as ye have &s;een him go into heaven.</Q> Here is no figurative language, no ambiguous expre&s;&s;ion. Neither is there any in what the apo&s;tle &s;ays concerning the re&s;urrection of the virtu|ous dead, which will take place at the coming of Chri&s;t, and which, in the Revelation is called <HI>the fir&s;t re&s;urrection,</HI> 1 The&s;. iv. 14. <Q>If we believe that Je&s;us died, and ro&s;e again, even &s;o them al&s;o who &s;leep in Je&s;us &s;hall God bring with him. For this we &s;ay unto you, by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, and remain unto the coming of the Lord, &s;hall have no advantage over tho&s;e who are a&s;leep. For the Lord him&s;elf &s;hall de&s;cend from heaven, with a &s;hout, with the voice of the archan|gel, and with the trump of God, and the dead in Chri&s;t &s;hall ri&s;e fir&s;t. Then we who are alive, and remain, &s;hall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air, and &s;o &s;hall we ever be with the Lord.</Q> Again he &s;ays, 1 Cor. xv. 51. <Q>We &s;hall not all &s;leep, but we &s;hall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the la&s;t trump. For the trumpet &s;hall &s;ound, and the dead &s;hall be rai&s;ed incor|ruptible, and we &s;hall be changed.</Q></P>
<P>The certainty of this great cata&s;trophe &s;hould be a &s;uffi|cient motive with all Chri&s;tians, who, as &s;uch, entertain no doubt with re&s;pect to the fact, to keep it con&s;tantly in view, and to regulate their whole conduct with a view to
<PB N="53" REF="027559_0051_0FD535A7ADA43FF8">
it. But if we apprehend it to be in a &s;tricter &s;en&s;e of the word really <HI>near,</HI> which, from the pre&s;ent a&s;pect of things, I own I am inclined to think may be the ca&s;e, our attention is drawn to it in a mo&s;t forcible manner. Did we really expect to &s;ee this great event, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the coming of Chri&s;t in the clouds of heaven, we &s;hould hardly think, or &s;peak, of any thing el&s;e; and the pre&s;ent commotions in the political world, extraordinary as they certainly are, would appear as nothing in compari&s;on with it. What would other|wi&s;e be <HI>great,</HI> would, with re&s;pect to <HI>this,</HI> event &s;eem ex|ceedingly <HI>little,</HI> and in&s;ignificant.</P>
<P>What then, my brethren, is the practical inference that we &s;hould draw from finding, or even &s;u&s;pecting, our|&s;elves to be in this &s;ituation, the kingdom of heaven being at hand, but to repent, and by a change of heart and of life to be prepared for it; that <Q>when our Lord &s;hall re|turn, and take an account of his &s;ervants, we may be found of him without &s;pot and blamele&s;s, and not be a&s;ha|med before him at his coming?</Q> 'Seeing,' as the apo&s;tle Peter &s;ays, <Q>we look for the&s;e things, what manner of per&s;ons ought we to be, in all holy conver&s;ation and god|line&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>The a&s;pect of things, it cannot be denied, is, in the highe&s;t degree, alarming, making life, and every thing in it, peculiarly uncertain. What could have been more un|expected than the events of any one of the la&s;t four years, at the beginning of it? What a total revolution in the ideas, and conduct of a whole nation! What a total &s;ubver&s;ion of principles, what rever&s;es of fortune, and what a wa&s;te of life! In how bloody and eventful a war are we engaged, how incon&s;iderable in its beginning, how rapid and wide
<PB N="54" REF="027559_0052_0FD535A8BA8A57E8">
in its progre&s;s, and how dark with re&s;pect to its termina|tion! At fir&s;t it re&s;embled Elijah's cloud, appearing no big|ger than a <HI>man's hand;</HI> but now it covers, and darkens, the whole European hemi&s;phere!</P>
<P>Now, whatever we may think, as politicians (and with us every man will have his own opinion, on a &s;ubject &s;o intere&s;ting to us all) I would, in this place, admoni&s;h you not to overlook the hand of God in the great &s;cene that is now opening upon us. Nothing can ever come to pa&s;s without his appointment, or permi&s;&s;ion; and then, what|ever be the views of men, we cannot doubt, but that his are always wi&s;e, righteous, and good. Let us, therefore, exerci&s;e faith in him, believing that though <Q>clouds and darkne&s;s are round about him, righteou&s;ne&s;s and judg|ment are for ever the habitation of his throne.</Q> All tho&s;e who appear on the theatre of public affairs, in the field, or the cabinet, both tho&s;e whom we prai&s;e, and tho&s;e whom we blame, are equally in&s;truments in his hands, and exe|cute all his plea&s;ure. Let this reflection, then, in our cooler moments, (and I hope we &s;hall endeavour, in all the tumult of affairs, to make the&s;e as many as po&s;&s;ible) lead us to look more to God, and le&s;s to man; and con|&s;equently, in all the troubles in which we may be involved, repo&s;e the mo&s;t un&s;haken confidence in him, and thence 'in patience po&s;&s;e&s;s our own &s;ouls,' e&s;pecially when it is evident that it is wholly out of our power to alter the cour&s;e of events. If we be careful &s;o to live as to be at all times prepared to die, what have we to fear, even though, as the P&s;almi&s;t &s;ays, the <Q>earth be removed, and the moun|tains be carried into the mid&s;t of the &s;ea?</Q> Whatever turn the cour&s;e of things may take, it cannot then be to our di&s;advantage. What, then, &s;hould hinder our con|templating
<PB N="55" REF="027559_0053_0FD535AB04B133D0">
the great &s;cene, that &s;eems now to be opening upon us, awful as it is, with tranquillity, and even with &s;a|tisfaction, from our firm per&s;ua&s;ion, that its termination will be glorious and happy?</P>
<P>La&s;tly, the more there are who indulge the&s;e enlarged and ju&s;t views, who cultivate a &s;en&s;e of piety to God (which will always lead us to &s;uppre&s;s re&s;entment, and to promote good-will towards men) the more favour, in the righteous admini&s;tration of Providence, will be &s;hewn to the country in which they &s;hall be found. God, we know, would have &s;pared even Sodom, if &s;o many as ten righte|ous men had been found in it; and our Saviour, alluding, as I am inclined to think, to the&s;e very times, which &s;eem to be approaching, &s;ays, that <Q>for the elect's &s;ake they will be &s;hortened.</Q> For our own &s;akes, therefore, for the &s;ake of our friends, of our country, and of every thing that is dear to us in it, let us attend to the admonition of my text, 'to repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.' It is 'righteou&s;ne&s;s that exalteth a nation,' and '&s;in' only is the 'reproach,' and will be the ruin, 'of any people.'</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING originally got the leading ideas that are enlarged upon in the preceding di&s;cour&s;e from <HI>Dr. Hart|ley's Ob&s;ervations on Man,</HI> a work publi&s;hed in 1749, I think it may not be ami&s;s to &s;ubjoin to it &s;ome extracts from that work, as, from his authority, the &s;erious ap|prehen&s;ions with which I have, ever &s;ince I read it, been impre&s;&s;ed, will receive more weight, than they could ac|quire from any per&s;on, who, writing in the&s;e times, might be &s;uppo&s;ed to be particularly influenced by the a&s;pect of them, and by his own &s;ituation with re&s;pect to them. I wi&s;h likewi&s;e by this, as well as by every other means, to direct the attention of my readers to that mo&s;t excellent work, to which I am indebted, if I may &s;o &s;ay, for the whole moral conformation of my mind.</P>
<P>How near the di&s;&s;olution of the pre&s;ent governments, generally or particularly, may be, would be great ra&s;h|ne&s;s to affirm. Chri&s;t will come in this &s;en&s;e al&s;o <Q>as a thief in the night.</Q> Our duty is therefore to watch and to pray; to be faithful &s;tewards; to give meat, and all other requi&s;ities, in due &s;ea&s;on, to tho&s;e under our care; and to endeavour by the&s;e, and all other lawful means, to pre&s;erve the government, under who&s;e protection we live, from di&s;&s;olution, &s;eeking the peace of it, and &s;ubmitting to every ordinance of man for the Lord's &s;ake. No pray|ers, no endeavours of this kind can fail of having &s;ome
<PB N="58" REF="027559_0055_0FD535AF27048298">
good effect, public or private, for the pre&s;ervation of our|&s;elves and others. The great di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence are conducted by means that are either &s;ecret, or, if they appear, that are judged feeble and inefficacious.&mdash;No man can tell, however private his &s;tation may be, but his &s;er|vent prayer, may avail to the &s;alvation of much people. But it is more peculiarly the duty of magi&s;trates thus to watch over their &s;ubjects, to pray for them, and to &s;et about the reformation of all matters civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical, to the utmo&s;t of their power. Good governors may pro|mote the welfare and continuance of a &s;tate, and wicked ones mu&s;t accelerate its ruin."</P>
<P>"The &s;acred hi&s;tory affords us in&s;tances of both kinds, and they are recorded there for the admonition of kings and princes in all futur times." Vol. ii. p. 368.</P>
<P>"There are many prophecies which declare the fall of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical powers of the Chri&s;tian world. And though each church &s;eems to &s;latter it&s;elf with the hopes of being exempted; yet it is very plain that the prophe|tical characters belong to all. They have all left the true, pure, &s;imple religion, and teach for doctrines the commandments of men. They are all merchants of the earth, and have &s;et up a kingdom of this world, abound|ing in riches, temporal power, and external pomp. They have all a dogmatizing &s;pirit, and per&s;ecute &s;uch as do not receive their own mark, and wor&s;hip the image which they have &s;et up. They all neglect Chri&s;t's command of preaching the go&s;pel to all nations, and even that of going to 'the lo&s;t &s;heep of the hou&s;e of I&s;rael;' there being in|numerable multitudes in all Chri&s;tian countries who have never been taught to read, and who are in other re&s;pects
<PB N="59" REF="027559_0056_0FD535B20D9E7340">
al&s;o de&s;titute of the means of &s;aving knowledge. 'Tis very true that the church of Rome is <Q>Babylon the great and the mother of harlots,</Q> and of the <Q>abominations of the earth.</Q> But all the re&s;t have copied her example more or le&s;s. They have all received money like <HI>Gehazi;</HI> and therefore the lepro&s;y of <HI>Naaman</HI> will cleave to them, and to their &s;eed for ever. And this impurity may be con&s;idered, not only as ju&s;tifying the application of the prophecies to all the Chri&s;tian churches, but as a natural cau&s;e for their downfall. The corrupt governors of the &s;everal churches will ever oppo&s;e the true go&s;pel, and in &s;o doing will bring ruin upon them&s;elves." P. 371.</P>
<P>"As the downfall of the Jewi&s;h &s;tate under Titus was the occa&s;ion of the publication of the go&s;pel to us Gen|tiles, &s;o our downfall may contribute to the re&s;toration of the Jews, and both together bring on the final publi|cation and prevalence of the true religion. Thus the type and the thing typi&s;ied will coincide. The fir&s;t fruits and the lump are made holy together." P. 375.</P>
<P>The downfall of the civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical powers mu&s;t both be attended with &s;uch public calamities, as will make men &s;erious, and al&s;o drive them From the countries of <HI>Chri&s;tendom</HI> into the remote parts of the world, parti|cularly into the Ea&s;t and We&s;t-Indies; whither, con&s;e|quently, they will carry their religion, now puri&s;ied from errors and &s;uper&s;titions. P. 377.</P>
<P>"That worldly-mindedne&s;s, and neglect of duty in the clergy, mu&s;t ha&s;ten our ruin, cannot be doubted, The&s;e are 'the &s;alt of the earth,' and the 'light of the 'world.' If they lo&s;e their favour, the whole nation,
<PB N="60" REF="027559_0057_0FD535B44EBB7FE8">
where this happens, will be converted into one putrid ma&s;s. If their light become darkne&s;s, the whole body politic mu&s;t be dark al&s;o. The degeneracy of the court of <HI>Rome,</HI> and &s;ecular bi&s;hops abroad, are too notorious to be mentioned. They almo&s;t cea&s;e to give offence, as they &s;carce pretend to any function or authority be&s;ides what is temporal. Yet &s;till there is great mockery of God in their external pomp, and pro&s;anation of &s;acred titles; which, &s;ooner or later, will bring down vengeance upon them. And as the court of Rome has been at the head of the great apo&s;ta&s;y, and corruption of the Chri&s;|tian church; and &s;eems evidently marked out in various places of the &s;criptures, the &s;evere&s;t judgments are pro|bably re&s;erved for her. But I rather choo&s;e to &s;peak to what falls under the ob&s;ervation of all &s;erious, attentive per&s;ons in this kingdom. The &s;uperior clergy are in ge|neral, ambitious, and eager in the pur&s;uit of riches; &s;lat|terers of the great, and &s;ub&s;ervient to party intere&s;t; neg|ligent of their own immediate charges, and al&s;o of the inferior clergy, and their immediate charges. The in|ferior clergy imitate their &s;uperiors, and in general take little more care of their pari&s;hes than barely what is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to avoid the cen&s;ure of the law. And the clergy of all ranks are, in general, either ignorant, or if they do apply, it is rather to profane learning, to philo&s;ophi|cal or political matters, than to the &s;tudy of the &s;criptures, of the Oriental languages, of the fathers, and eccle&s;ia&s;|tical authors, and of the writings of devout men in dif|ferent ages of the church. I &s;ay this is in general the ca&s;e; i.e. far the greater part of the clergy of all ranks in this kingdom are of this kind. But there are &s;ome of a quite different character; men eminent for piety, &s;acred learning, and the faithful di&s;charge of their duty, and
<PB N="61" REF="027559_0058_0FD535B71B899B38">
who, it is not to be doubted, mourn in &s;ecret for the cry|ing &s;ins of this and other nations. The clergy, in general, are al&s;o far more free from open and gro&s;s vices, than any other denomination of men among&s;t us, phy&s;icians, law|yers, merchants, &s;oldiers, &amp;c. However, this may be otherwi&s;e hereafter. For it is &s;aid that in &s;ome foreign countries the &s;uperior clergy, in others the inferior, are as corrupt and abandoned, or more &s;o, than any other order of men. The clergy in this kingdom &s;eem to be what one might expect from the mixture of good and bad influences that affect them. But then, if we make this candid allow|ance for <HI>them,</HI> we mu&s;t al&s;o make it for per&s;ons in the high ranks of life, for their infidelity, lewdne&s;s, and fordid &s;elf|intere&s;t. And though it becomes an humble, charitable and impartial man, to make all the&s;e allowances, yet he cannot but &s;ee, that the judgments of God are ready to fall upon us all for the&s;e things; and that they may fall fir&s;t, and with the greate&s;t weight, upon tho&s;e, who, having the highe&s;t office committed to them in the &s;piritual king|dom of Chri&s;t, neglect it, and are become mere <Q>mer|chants of the earth,</Q> and <Q>&s;hepherds that feed them|&s;elves, and not their flocks.</Q> P. 450.</P>
<P>"The&s;e are my real and earne&s;t &s;entiments upon the&s;e points. It would be great ra&s;hne&s;s to fix a time for the breaking of the &s;torm that hangs over our heads, as it is blindne&s;s and in&s;atuation not to &s;ee it; nor to be aware, that it may break. And yet this in&s;atuation has always attended all falling &s;tates. The kingdoms of Judah and I&s;rael, which are the types of all the re&s;t, were thus in|&s;atuated. It may be, that the prophecies concerning Edom, Moab, Ammon, Tyre, Egypt, &amp;c. will become ap|plicable to particular kingdoms before their fall, and warn

the good to flee out of them. And Chri&s;tendom in gene|ral &s;eems ready to a&s;&s;ume to it&s;elf the place and lot of the Jews, after they had rejected their Me&s;&s;iah, the Saviour of the world. Let no one deceive him&s;elf, or others. The pre&s;ent circum&s;tances of the world are extraordinary and critical, beyond what has ever yet happened. If we re|fu&s;e to let Chri&s;t reign over us, as our Redeemer and Sa|viour, we mu&s;t be &s;lain before his face, as enemies, at his &s;econd coming." 455.</P>
<P>To the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages from Dr. Hartley, I &s;hall add another from an excellent <HI>Sermon preached in the chapel of Trinity College, Cambridge, December</HI> 13, 1793, <HI>the day appointed for the commemoration of the Benefactors that of Society.</HI> P. 13&punc; &amp;c.</P>
<P>"Nature recoils with horror at the &s;pectacle now pre|&s;ented by their unfortunate country [France]. Under the guidance, however, of divine revelation, the contempla|tive mind may di&s;cern the &s;igns of the&s;e times, and the hand of Providence directing the madne&s;s of the people. The oracles of truth, when foretelling the per&s;ecutions to be endured by Chri&s;tians, a&s;&s;ure us, <Q>He that killeth with the &s;word, mu&s;t be killed with the &s;word.</Q> <HI>They have &s;hed</HI> (&s;aith the angel) <HI>the blood of &s;aints and prophets, and thou ha&s;t given them blood to drink; for they are worthy.</HI> De&s;truction awaits the per&s;ecutor. And it mu&s;t excite our a&s;toni&s;h|ment to &s;ee ve&s;tiges of this righteous di&s;pen&s;ation in what is pa&s;&s;ing before us. Lyons is recorded in early hi&s;tory, as the &s;pot where a company of Martyrs glori&s;ied God. Lyons is now devoted, and its name era&s;ed from the memo|ry of man. Paris once &s;treamed with the blood of the Hugonots: Paris hath &s;ince been dyed with the &s;laughter

of that court and clergy, which in&s;tigated the unuttera|ble deed."</P>
<P>"Let us, too, be hone&s;t in declaring, whether if the ma&s;&s;acre of Saint Bartholomew, the revocation of the edict of Nantz, or a &s;pani&s;h act of faith, were dictated by the &s;pirit of Antichri&s;t; the deprivation of the TWO THOUSAND ejected Mini&s;ters; the &s;everities which forced our countrymen to take refuge in the wilds of America, and the two religious conflagrations which have di&s;gra|ced our own days, demon&s;trated the pre&s;iding influence of a mind like that which was in Je&s;us."</P>
<P>"One particular in which the prophecy appears to en|lighten us, is the fate of the Gallican church. The re|volted city of the apocalyp&s;e is &s;uppo&s;ed to repre&s;ent the antichri&s;tian community e&s;tabli&s;hed in the European ter|ritory of the we&s;tern Roman empire, &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in its pollarchical and di&s;membered &s;tate. Of this city it is written, that the fall of a tenth part would a &s;hort time precede that of the re&s;t; and that its overthrow would be accompanied by an earthquake, and the de&s;truction of <HI>&s;even chiliads of the names of men.</HI> As France was one of the ten kingdoms founded on the ruins of the we&s;tern empire; as violent commotions are now agitating the po|litical world, from the Bory&s;thenes to the Atlantic; as &s;even cla&s;&s;es have lately been deprived of their privileges and titles; the curio&s;ity of the Chri&s;tian &s;cholar is beyond mea&s;ure excited; and will be gratified with the di&s;covery of various circum&s;tances which will confirm his faith; but which a de&s;ire of brevity obliges me to refer to his private con&s;ideration. One que&s;tion, however, I cannot help propo&s;ing; that if <HI>we</HI> be of that cho&s;en people who

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING been reque&s;ted to publi&s;h this &s;er|mon, I have annexed to it my letter of re&s;ignation, for the &s;ake of introducing the an&s;wer of the con|gregation, and the addre&s;&s;es that have been &s;ent to me, on occa&s;ion of my leaving this country, from the two united congregations at Birmingham, from the Unitarian Society, and from the young men and women who have attended my private lectures on the &s;ubject of natural and revealed re|ligion. I wi&s;h to expre&s;s my gratitude for the affection that has been &s;hewn me, by perpetuating, as far as I can, the marks that I have received of it. The&s;e addre&s;&s;es will al&s;o &s;erve to &s;hew that, though calumniated, and execrated, by many, this has been more than compen&s;ated by the warm attachment of others; which may encourage per|&s;ons in &s;imilar &s;ituations to per&s;evere in what ap|pears to them to be right, fearle&s;s of any con&s;e|quences that may re&s;ult from it. The&s;e addre&s;&s;es contain &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions that are too highly com|plimentary. But, as Dr. Franklin u&s;ed to &s;ay, <Q>undue prai&s;e may &s;erve to balance undue cen|&s;ure.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="027559_0065_0FD535C6AA260DE8">
It is painful, no doubt, to take leave, as I do in this di&s;cour&s;e, of &s;uch a congregation as that with which I have been &s;o happily connected, and which promi&s;ed increa&s;ing &s;atisfaction. But &s;uch genuine marks of e&s;teem and affection, as I have received from the members of it, cannot be unat|tended with plea&s;ure. No joy, or &s;orrow, in this life, can be expected to be wholly unmixed. This is a world of trial and di&s;cipline; and we &s;hould be willing to take the painful, as well as the plea|&s;urable ingredients in it. It will be happy if we be improved by them, and be thereby prepared for a &s;tate, in which this kind of di&s;cipline will not be nece&s;&s;ary; where there will be <Q>no more pain,</Q> and where <Q>all tears will be wiped from our eyes.</Q></P>
<P>I al&s;o take this opportunity of expre&s;&s;ing my &s;atisfaction in the candid attention with which I have of late been heard by unu&s;ually crowded au|diences, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of &s;trangers; thinking it to be a &s;ymptom of abating prejudice, and of the prevalence of better information than has hitherto obtained. The time, I hope, is approach|ing, when all delu&s;ion will vani&s;h; when men and things will be &s;een in their true light; and the prevalence of truth will, no doubt, be attended with an increa&s;e of general happine&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>FAREWELL DISCOURSE.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q>AND NOW, BRETHREN, I COMMEND YOU TO GOD, AND THE WORD OF HIS GRACE, WHICH IS ABLE TO BUILD YOU UP, AND TO GIVE YOU AN INHERITANCE AMONG THEM THAT ARE SANCTIFIED.
<BIBL>ACTS xx. 32.</BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY CHRISTIAN BRETHREN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BEING now to re&s;ign my pa&s;toral charge among you, my thoughts are naturally turned to the &s;entiments expre&s;&s;ed by the apo&s;tle Paul, when he was in a &s;imilar &s;ituation with re&s;pect to the church of Ephe&s;us. I do not pretend to his zeal or activity; but my wi&s;hes for your be&s;t intere&s;ts are &s;incere and ardent, and I cannot &s;hew it better than by directing your attention to &s;entiments mo&s;t intere&s;ting to us all as Chri&s;tians, and mo&s;t conducive to our common edification.</P>
<P>With Paul I commend you to the good providence of God; praying that he would direct you in all your ways, and e&s;pecially that you may be led to a right knowledge of the go&s;pel, that you may imbibe the genuine &s;pirit, and practi&s;e the duties of it, as the only way to en&s;ure your pre&s;ent and future happine&s;s. In his own emphatical
<PB N="72" REF="027559_0067_0FD535CCD15462D8">
language, in my text, <Q>I commend you to God, and the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and and to give you an inheritance among them that are &s;anctified.</Q> By &s;ecuring the latter, you cannot entertain a doubt of your title to the former. For, as the &s;ame apo&s;tle ob&s;erves, <Q>all things work together for good to them that love God,</Q> the great object of the di&s;pen&s;a|tion of the go&s;pel being <Q>to purify to him&s;elf a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</Q></P>
<P>This is al&s;o the great object of all Chri&s;tian churches. They con&s;i&s;t of per&s;ons who form them&s;elves into &s;ocie|ties for the purpo&s;e of promoting their mutual edifica|tion, and with this view they provide them&s;elves with &s;uch <HI>mini&s;ters,</HI> or a&s;&s;i&s;tants (for &s;uch is the real meaning and na|ture of our office) as they deem be&s;t calculated to promote that end; giving them proper lei&s;ure for the &s;tudy of the &s;criptures, for &s;toring their minds with &s;uch knowledge as will be&s;t qualify them to in&s;truct others, and for the acquire|ment of every other accompli&s;hment that can enable them to do it to the mo&s;t advantage. An office and employment the mo&s;t truly u&s;eful, and therefore honourable.</P>
<P>The great importance of this object of Chri&s;tian &s;ocieties is &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ed by the apo&s;tle in my text. It is nothing le&s;s than to <HI>build up</HI> the members of them, that is, in faith and holine&s;s, to rai&s;e and improve their characters, in order <Q>to give them an inheritance among them that are &s;anctified;</Q> <HI>i. e.</HI> to prepare them for future happine&s;s. It is, as it were, to take men out of the world, to wean them from the low pur&s;uits and gratifications of it, and to make them <HI>citizens of heaven;</HI> to rai&s;e the <HI>&s;ons of men</HI> to the high character, and honour,
<PB N="73" REF="027559_0068_0FD535CCD65E9FA0">
of the <HI>&s;ons of God,</HI> and make them heirs of a happy im|mortality. And is not every other object low and mean compared with this? Give it, then, that place in your regards to which it is entitled, and, amid&s;t all the ne|ce&s;&s;ary cares of this life, never lo&s;e &s;ight of your great de&s;tination for another. Suffer not your minds to be fa&s;cinated by any thing that this world can pre&s;ent to you; but, as the apo&s;tle exhorts, holding all other things in de&s;ervedly low e&s;timation, <Q>walk worthy of God, and be fruitful in every good word and work to do his will.</Q> 'Seeing,' as another apo&s;tle ob&s;erves, <Q>that all the&s;e things mu&s;t be di&s;&s;olved,</Q> &s;ince all our connexions here mu&s;t &s;oon be broken, at lea&s;t by death, and an infinitely more important &s;tate awaits us beyond the grave, <Q>what manner of per&s;ons ought we to be in all holy conver&s;a|tion and godline&s;s?</Q></P>
<P>All the connexions we form here, the mo&s;t endearing and important ones, are &s;light and tran&s;ient. We may flatter our&s;elves that we are planning our de&s;tination for a long time to come, and make our arrangements ac|cordingly, as I did when I was &s;ettled at Birmingham, and again with you; but unfore&s;een circum&s;tances occur, and all our plans are deranged, new ones mu&s;t be form|ed, and a great portion of life is often employed, and in, a manner wa&s;ted, in making new arrangements, which may prove to be as temporary, and to as little purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>But, my brethren, the go&s;pel, the &s;tudy and practice of which it has been my bu&s;ine&s;s to recommend to you, holds out to us an object as much more fixed and &s;table, as it is in it&s;elf of more value. On habitations here are peri&s;hable, liable to be de&s;troyed by lawle&s;s violence;
<PB N="74" REF="027559_0069_0FD535D4F3197390">
but there are <Q>hou&s;es not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.</Q> Here we have <HI>no continuing city,</HI> no place of ab&s;olute &s;ecurity, where we can depend upon not being di&s;turbed. But in heaven is <Q>a re&s;t for the people of God,</Q> a place where 'the wicked cea&s;e from troubling,' and where tho&s;e who are weary with their uncea&s;ing per&s;ecution may depend upon being unmole&s;ted. Let us, then, when we are hara&s;&s;ed and di&s;turbed here, and e&s;pecially when we are expo&s;ed to di&s;turbance becau&s;e we our&s;elves are di&s;po&s;ed to be quiet, wi&s;hing to live at peace our&s;elves, and de&s;irous of promoting a di&s;po&s;ition to peace in others, look forwards to that peaceful and happy &s;tate, and cultivate a temper of mind mo&s;t &s;uited to it.</P>
<P>Permit me to add, that I flatter my&s;elf our approach|ing &s;eparation may furni&s;h and additional motive for doing every thing in our power to &s;ecure a happy meeting, and a more permanent connexion, in a world of greater &s;tability than this. On my part, I have thought the connexion a happy one, and was far from having any wi&s;h ever to change it on this &s;ide the grave; and &s;uch, I would hope, has been your di&s;po&s;ition with re&s;pect to me. And what is it that makes heaven it&s;elf mo&s;t de&s;irable, but the &s;ociety of &s;uch friends as we wi&s;h to live with here? This world, in its pre&s;ent &s;tate, would be &s;ufficiently paradi&s;iacal for men, if they were what they ought to be, and what they are capable of being, if they were as improved in all re&s;pects as we have rea&s;on to think they hereafter will be. If, then, our pre&s;ent &s;eparation be painful, let us be looking, and preparing, for a &s;tate in which no event &s;o mutually di&s;agreeable will occur.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="027559_0070_0FD535D88B39FA48">
Our pre&s;ent &s;ituation, and that of the Di&s;&s;enters in general, calls in a particular manner for the exerci&s;e of Chri&s;tian principles. The cau&s;e of the Di&s;&s;enters may now be be &s;aid to be, what Chri&s;tianity it&s;elf originally was, and long continued to be, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <Q>a &s;ect every where &s;poken again&s;t.</Q> We are expo&s;ed to in&s;ult and outrage, though not to open and avowed per&s;ecution, on this ac|count. But this &s;ituation, though not to be de&s;ired by us, is mo&s;t favourable to the cultivation of that temper of mind which is mo&s;t eminently Chri&s;tian, to the virtues of patience, fortitude, meekne&s;s, forgivene&s;s of injuries, and heavenly-mindedne&s;s; virtues of the mo&s;t exalted kind, contributing mo&s;t to the dignity of human nature, but for which there is comparatively but little call, or oc|ca&s;ion, in a &s;ea&s;on of pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>'Woe unto you,' &s;ays our Saviour, <Q>when all men &s;peak well of you.</Q> But, <Q>ble&s;&s;ed are ye when men &s;hall revile you, and per&s;ecute you, and &s;ay all manner of evil again&s;t you fal&s;ely for my name's &s;ake.</Q> Let us, in the fir&s;t place, then, &s;hew that the evil that is &s;poken of us is <HI>fal&s;ely</HI> &s;poken, that is, give rea&s;onable evidence of it; for to &s;atisfy the violently prejudiced is impo&s;&s;ible, and not to be expected of any man. It is what our Saviour him&s;elf and the apo&s;tles were unequal to. But this be|ing done, with re&s;pect to tho&s;e who are at all candid, and who will hear rea&s;on, con&s;cious integrity is abun|dantly &s;ufficient to &s;upport a man under any calumny.</P>
<P>Moreover, con&s;cious of our own integrity, we can look down upon our enemies, not with hatred or ill will, but with compa&s;&s;ion, as beings in a depraved and imper|fect
<PB N="76" REF="027559_0071_0FD535DA33716B18">
&s;tate, neither qualified to be happy them&s;elves, nor to communicate happine&s;s to others.</P>
<P>All per&s;ons under the influence of malignant pa&s;&s;ions are nece&s;&s;arily, and by the invariable law of our natures, in an unea&s;y &s;tate. Their habitual feelings, even when gratified, are unplea&s;ant. But the feelings of tho&s;e who are merely expo&s;ed to the malignity of others, without feeling any thing of the kind them&s;elves, are &s;erene, and highly plea&s;urable; be&s;ides being attended with a con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;uperiority of character, and of greater ad|vances in intellectual improvement.</P>
<P>The man who obeys the fir&s;t impul&s;e of natural ap|petite, corporeal or mental, gives no proof of his being even a rational agent; for brutes are governed by appetite. But the man who refrains from gratifying his appetite, and natural de&s;ire, whether that of revenging him&s;elf upon his enemy, or any other, mu&s;t do it by the help of <HI>rea&s;on.</HI> He mu&s;t have &s;ome degree of comprehen&s;ion of mind, which takes in di&s;tant objects; and this is the thing that manife&s;ts a &s;uperiority of character.</P>
<P>The man who can even defer his revenge, and merely re&s;train his pa&s;&s;ion, is &s;uperior to him who gives way to the fir&s;t impul&s;e of it. But he who can &s;o far make al|lowance for the hatred of his enemies, as to feel compa&s;|&s;ion and good-will towards them, while he knows the ill will they bear him, is infinitely &s;uperior. We are not moved to anger by the anger of a child. Neither, then, &s;hould we be by the anger and malignity of tho&s;e grown per&s;ons, whom, with re&s;pect to intellectual and moral improvement, we regard in no higher a light.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="027559_0072_0FD535DBC2E92DA0">
On account of the low rank of every &s;entiment border|ing on anger and re&s;entment (requiring only particular impre&s;&s;ions to excite them, and much reflection to &s;up|pre&s;s them) &s;uch as zeal for any particular cau&s;e, even that of religion, it is ea&s;y to excite it, and lead men to act upon it with the greate&s;t violence, &s;o as to hate and per&s;ecute others who differ from them. Men who have no real religion at all can do this, as is evident in all per&s;ecutions, in the hi&s;tory of the cru&s;ades, when hundreds of thou&s;ands, moved, as they imagined with holy zeal, went to drive the infidels from the Holy Land, and al&s;o in the riots in Birmingham. Al&s;o to &s;uffer in any cau&s;e with the &s;pirit with which men die in battle, that is, with ob&s;tinacy and hatred, is not very dif|ficult. Mahometans fight for their religion, and the North American Indians die with the greate&s;t heroi&s;m in this re&s;pect. But to &s;uffer and die with meekne&s;s, with re&s;ignation to God, and good-will to men, not excepting our per&s;ecutors; to die praying with our Saviour, <Q>Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do,</Q> is a far more difficult attainment, but by no means uncommon among Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>Still le&s;s &s;hall we be di&s;turbed at the malignity of others, when we con&s;ider that our enemies, as well as our friends, are acting the part a&s;&s;igned them by the Supreme Ruler of the univer&s;e, that they are in their proper place as well as we in ours (though, being in&s;tigated by their own bad di&s;po&s;itions, this is no apology for their conduct) and that the plan of the great drama, in which we are all actors, is &s;o arranged, that good will finally re&s;ult from the evil that we experience our&s;elves, or &s;ee in others. 'The wrath of man,' &s;ays the P&s;almi&s;t, <Q>&s;hall prai&s;e God.</Q></P>

All the oppo&s;ition we meet with makes part of the u&s;e|ful and nece&s;&s;ary di&s;cipline of life, and no great character could be formed, or any great good be done, without it. Our Saviour, the apo&s;tles, the reformers from Popery, and the Puritans and Nonconformi&s;ts, were equally ex|po&s;ed to it. And &s;hall we complain? We ought rather to think our&s;elves honoured by it, and, with the apo&s;tles, <Q>rejoice that we are counted worthy to &s;uffer for the name of the Lord Je&s;us;</Q> reflecting, that <Q>if we &s;uffer with him, we &s;hall al&s;o reign with him, and be glori|fied together.</Q> Of our Lord him&s;elf it is &s;aid, that <Q>for the joy that was &s;et before him he endured the cro&s;s, de&s;pi&s;ing the &s;hame.</Q> Ought we not, then, I will not &s;ay be di&s;plea&s;ed, and complain, but ought we not to rejoice, and be thankful, for every part of that di&s;pen&s;a|tion of Providence, which we cannot doubt is calculated, and intended, to be &s;o highly beneficial to us?</P>
<P>If we take a calm retro&s;pect of our own pa&s;t experience, we &s;hall all of us, I am per&s;uaded, be &s;atisfied that many events, &s;eemingly the mo&s;t di&s;a&s;trous, were, in fact, the mo&s;t beneficial to us; that they were really mercies, though in the di&s;gui&s;e of judgments. And &s;hall we not then conclude, that every other evil, coming from the &s;ame hand, equally leads to good, though we may not for the pre&s;ent &s;ee it to be &s;o. When Jacob lo&s;t his beloved &s;on Jo&s;eph, he &s;aid, <Q>All the&s;e things are again&s;t me;</Q> though it appeared afterwards to be eminently <HI>for</HI> him. As the p&s;almi&s;t &s;ays with re&s;pect to God, <Q>Clouds and darkne&s;s are round about him, righteou&s;ne&s;s and judgment are the habitation of his throne.</Q></P>
<P>Thus in&s;tructed by the unerring word of God, and our own experience, as far as it goes, concurring with it,
<PB N="79" REF="027559_0074_0FD535DEC1442090">
we may be prepared to adopt the noble language of the prophet Habakkuk; who, after enumerating the lo&s;s of every thing valuable to man, and that not only tended to his comfort, but was &s;eemingly nece&s;&s;ary to his exi&s;tence in this life, could &s;ay, <Q>Yet will I rejoice in the Lord, and joy in the God of my &s;alvation.</Q> With re&s;pect to the &s;ociety of friends, and every thing el&s;e that is mo&s;t dear to us (and many of the&s;e I &s;hall be deprived of in leaving this connexion) we mu&s;t &s;ay with Job, <Q>The Lord gave, and the Lord taketh away, and ble&s;&s;ed be the name of the Lord.</Q> Something may ari&s;e our of our afflictions, or even accompany them, that &s;hall be an abundant compen&s;ation for them. And if they only reach us patience, fortitude, and tru&s;t in God, it is alone an abundant compen&s;ation, though they &s;hould bring nothing el&s;e along with them.</P>
<P>While we are &s;en&s;ible that we live under the govern|ment of a good Being, we cannot doubt, but that every thing that befals us is intended for our good. We mu&s;t not forget, that it is only by di&s;cipline, and often very &s;e|vere di&s;cipline too, that great and excellent characters are ever formed; and no man can tell how much, or how &s;e|vere di&s;cipline may be nece&s;&s;ary for him&s;elf. David could &s;ay, that 'before he was afflicted he went a&s;tray.' And there is a &s;ource of &s;atisfaction even in adver&s;ity, or nearly connected with it, that per&s;ons in pro&s;perity and afflu|ence have no idea of.</P>
<P>Of this I am my&s;elf not without &s;ome experience. My violent expul&s;ion from a favourite &s;ituation at Birming|ham was, to appearance, &s;ufficiently di&s;a&s;trous, and I was not without feeling it to be &s;o. Yet I have had more
<PB N="80" REF="027559_0075_0FD535E47324C600">
than a recompen&s;e, internal and external; &s;o as to make me con&s;ider it even now as no evil upon the whole; and I am far from wi&s;hing, if it were po&s;&s;ible, that it might not have happened.</P>
<P>Among other re&s;ources afforded me by a kind Provi|dence, was the &s;ea&s;onable and generous reception I met with among you; an event which I hope you are con|vinced I have endeavoured to improve.</P>
<P>Having, without any previous expectation, found a &s;phere of u&s;efulne&s;s, and a &s;ource of happine&s;s, here, I &s;hall not de&s;pair of finding a &s;imilar &s;ituation in America. But there is no &s;ituation in the world, in which they who are di&s;po&s;ed to exert them&s;elves in the &s;ervice of mankind (which is the mo&s;t proper &s;ervice of God, our common creator and parent) may not find an opportunity of doing it, to more or le&s;s advantage; and no man is an&s;werable for more than it is in his power to do.</P>
<P>But a &s;tate of &s;uffering is a &s;tate of u&s;efulne&s;s, no le&s;s than one of the mo&s;t active exertion; and very frequently it operates in the mo&s;t effectual and di&s;tingui&s;hed man|ner. Did not our Saviour effect more by his death, the apo&s;tles by their &s;ufferings, and the Prote&s;tant martyrs by their various per&s;ecutions, than by their preaching? It is commonly, and ju&s;t ob&s;erved, that "example is be|fore precept." And what is it that demon&s;trates the real force of religious principles &s;o much as patient &s;uffering for them? It is a clear proof of the value that the &s;uf|ferer &s;ets upon them, and &s;uch as is more likely to im|pre&s;s others than any argument. And the experience of ages confirms the ob&s;ervation, &s;o as to have given ri&s;e to
<PB N="81" REF="027559_0076_0FD535EA106C9318">
the proverb, that "the blood of the martyrs is the &s;eed of the church."</P>
<P>Was the per&s;ecution of the early Chri&s;tians, of the Prote&s;tants in France, in the Low Countries, or in Eng|land, of any di&s;&s;ervice to their cau&s;e? Did the per&s;ecu|tion of the Puritans by queen Elizabeth, and the Stuarts, dimini&s;h their numbers, or their zeal? It increa&s;ed both, as appeared at the time of the civil wars. What do we learn on this &s;ubject from the different treatment that Di&s;|&s;enters have met with in late times? They have con|&s;tantly melted away in the &s;un&s;hine of pro&s;perity, and have become numerous and zealous in adver&s;ity. It is even probable that their numbers were dimini&s;hed one third, if not one half, and the re&s;t were grown very luke|warm, in the reigns of George I. and II. princes who were friendly to them; but of late their numbers, and their zeal, are greatly increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>Shall we he&s;itate, then, to &s;uffer in the cau&s;e of im|portant truth, when we &s;ee it to be &s;o greatly promoted by this means? If we have any value for our principles, we &s;hall rejoice in the opportunities that are afforded us of &s;erving the cau&s;e of truth in &s;ea&s;ons of per&s;ecution (occurring in the cour&s;e of divine Providence, and not &s;ought by our&s;elves, for that would be o&s;tentation and pre&s;umption) as the only way in which many per&s;ons have it in their power to promote it, to any great pur|po&s;e. For all can advance the cau&s;e by &s;uffering, though but few have &s;ufficient ability to argue for it. But dou|bly honoured is the man whom Providence enables, and di&s;po&s;es (for all is of God) to &s;erve the cau&s;e of truth in both the&s;e ways.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="027559_0077_0FD535EA106C9318">
Be&s;ides, &s;uch a degree of per&s;ecution as that to which we are expo&s;ed, will tend to purge our &s;ocieties of luke|warm and unworthy members of men who prefer the world, and the things of it, to the cau&s;e of truth, and a good con&s;cience; and &s;uch are many of the richer &s;ort among us, and in all &s;ocieties; men who, by a&s;&s;ociating with other rich and worldly-minded men, and e&s;pecially tho&s;e who are within the influence of a court, and the honours and emoluments derived from it, catch too much of their &s;pirit, become a&s;&s;imilated to their manners, and adopt their views. Let all &s;uch go to their proper place: we want them not. We want not even their wealth. True Chri&s;tianity does not &s;uppo&s;e, or require it. But in all ca&s;es of per&s;ecution, &s;ome of the mo&s;t wealthy have proved the mo&s;t zealous.</P>
<P>True Chri&s;tians, devoid of &s;uper&s;tition, will meet for public wor&s;hip, and edify one another, even without the aid, or expence, of regular mini&s;ters. The&s;e are, no doubt, a convenience, but by no means nece&s;&s;ary, even to the admini&s;tration of the ordinances of bapti&s;m, or the Lord's &s;upper. And, in &s;ituations in which mini&s;ters cannot be had, Chri&s;tian laymen will, I hope, have the good &s;en&s;e to do them&s;elves every thing that has been u&s;ually done by their mini&s;ters. And at this time, there are helps abundantly &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;e, even though Chri&s;tian &s;ocieties &s;hould be as de&s;titute of talents, as of wealth.</P>
<P>This excellent le&s;&s;on will be taught more effectually in a &s;ea&s;on of adver&s;ity, than of pro&s;perity. And we ought to be thankful for every &s;ituation in which &s;uch valuable in&s;truction is be&s;t inculcated. In the fir&s;t and be&s;t

ages of Chri&s;tianity, not 'many wi&s;e men after the fle&s;h,' and 'not many mighty were cho&s;en.' And our Saviour even thanked his heavenly Father, that the go&s;pel was hidden from the wi&s;e and prudent;' not the truly wi&s;e, but from worldly wi&s;e men, tho&s;e who have the world and the things of it for their chief object.</P>
<P>When riches and honours are the reward of Chri&s;tia|nity, it will be thought by the world, that the profe&s;&s;ion of it is adopted for the &s;ake of tho&s;e riches and honours, and no other rea&s;on of their conduct will be &s;o much as looked for. But when a man's faith is attended with per&s;ecution, and abu&s;e in every form, it will be evident that it has &s;ome other foundation, and &s;uch as will be thought worth enquiring into. And a di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate in|quiry is all that truth, and Chri&s;tianity, if it be founded on truth, requires. The &s;ame is the ca&s;e with re&s;pect to any particular mode or form of Chri&s;tianity. It di&s;claims all connexion with civil power, and worldly emolument.</P>
<P>It may ju&s;tly be our pride, that, as Unitarians, our re|ligion has been &s;o far from being befriended, that it has, in all ages, and in all nations, been frowned upon, by the civil magi&s;trate; and yet in the&s;e &s;eemingly unfavourable circum&s;tances, it has con&s;tantly gained ground, and of late in a tenfold proportion to what it has ever done be|fore, with thinking and &s;erious men. Can there be a &s;urer indication than this, that it will continue to gain ground, till it e&s;tabli&s;h it&s;elf univer&s;ally? But even then, it will, I tru&s;t, be as independent, as it is at pre&s;ent, of that civil <HI>power</HI> which is now ho&s;tile to it. Hereafter, when time &s;hall have abated the force of prejudice, it may be recorded to your honour, that you received not my&s;elf, as an individual, but an Unitarian, &s;o obnoxious

<P>Having &s;hewn this Chri&s;tian fortitude, and acted with &s;o much true judgment, I hope you will continue to act the &s;ame part, unmoved by the cen&s;ures of an unthinking world, and promoting the peace and welfare of your country; with being enemies to which we are mo&s;t un|ju&s;tly charged.</P>

<P>In all events, our &s;eparation, and that from any of our friends, by death, or otherwi&s;e, is, in the eye of rea&s;on, of &s;hort continuance.

And the happy con&s;equence of this will be many per&s;ons embracing one another as brethren, who were here the mo&s;t ho&s;tile to each other.</P>
<P>Then every truth will be &s;een, not only in its whole evidence, but in its proper importance. Bigotry, con&s;e|quently, will be unknown, and no mi&s;takes but tho&s;e of the heart will be thought to be of any moment at all.</P>
<P>Could we imbibe the&s;e &s;entiments here below, we &s;hould make earth it&s;elf a perfect heaven; and our doing this as well as we are able, will be our be&s;t preparation for that bli&s;sful &s;tate.

<P>As an evidence of your having imbibed the true &s;pirit of Chri&s;tianity your&s;elves, and of your being &s;en&s;ible of its importance, you will, each of you, exert your&s;elves in your &s;everal &s;pheres, to extend the knowledge of it to others, and al&s;o endeavour to infu&s;e the &s;ame &s;pirit into them.

only, <HI>Clergy</HI> and <HI>laity,</HI> in the &s;en&s;e in which the terms are now u&s;ed, are unknown in the &s;criptures. All Chri&s;tians are there di&s;tingui&s;hed by the phra&s;e that is now rendered <HI>clergy.</HI> All Chri&s;tians are there &s;aid to be 'kings and prie&s;ts unto God;' and every man who can teach, &s;hould be a teacher; and without any ordination, be&s;ides the reque&s;t of his fellow Chri&s;tians, admini&s;ter every Chri&s;tian ordinance.</P>
<P>But independently of this, which may be &s;aid to require &s;ome talents and ability, not po&s;&s;ed by all, there is a method in which all Chri&s;tians, without exception, may be teachers of Chri&s;tianity, and recommend it to others. It is by the open profe&s;&s;ion of it, and by a life and con|ver&s;ation conformable to it. This, though a &s;ilent, is, in many re&s;pects, the mo&s;t effectual, method of preaching. <Q>Let your light &s;hine before men, that they, &s;eeing your good works, may glorify your father who is in heaven.</Q></P>
<P>But the mere open profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity by per&s;ons of re&s;pectable characters, that is, per&s;ons in general e&s;teem for their good &s;en&s;e and good conduct, in an age like this, abounding with unbelievers, is of it&s;elf of great importance. Gladly would unbelievers have it to &s;ay that all men of &s;en&s;e are with them. On the contrary, I am confident that, whatever may be &s;aid with re&s;pect to good &s;en&s;e, or natural ability, which is often employed to the wor&s;t of purpo&s;es, men of real knowledge and reflection, as well as men of virtue and integrity, men who have given the mo&s;t &s;erious attention to the &s;ubject, and men of the mo&s;t upright and unbia&s;&s;ed minds, without which natural ability will avail but little, are with us.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="027559_0082_0FD535FC8B650DA0">
But to recommend Chri&s;tianity to men of rea&s;on and reflection, it mu&s;t be made to appear a rational thing. Men cannot embrace as &s;acred truth any thing at which their common &s;en&s;e revolts. Nor can that be con&s;idered as a truth of revealed religion, which is contrary to the mo&s;t obvious and acknowledged truths of natural religion. And the greate&s;t part of the unbelief of the pre&s;ent age, has evidently ari&s;en from the gro&s;s abu&s;es and corrup|tions of Chri&s;tianity, e&s;pecially &s;uch as are &s;upported by the civil e&s;tabli&s;hments of it. The&s;e it is the duty of every enlightened Chri&s;tian, as he values his religion, and wi&s;hes to extend the knowledge of it, &s;trenuou&s;ly to op|po&s;e. And the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things calls for this in a peculiar manner.</P>
<P>Unbelievers mu&s;t be &s;hewn that their triumph over &s;uch Chri&s;tianity as is &s;upported by the &s;tate, will avail them nothing. It is only their triumph over error and &s;uper&s;tition, which are the bane of Chri&s;tianity. What do they gain by expo&s;ing &s;uch doctrines as tho&s;e of tran|&s;ub&s;tantiation, and the trinity? The&s;e are not the doc|trines of the &s;criptures, but the ab&s;urd devices of men; doctrines which, indeed, naturally aro&s;e in the &s;tate of things in which Chri&s;tianity was embraced by heathens, previou&s;ly tinctured with their peculiar notions, but con|trary to the plaine&s;t maxims and axioms of the &s;criptures.</P>
<P>The doctrine of the <HI>unity of God,</HI> is the one great ob|ject of the whole of the Jewi&s;h religion, and a&s;&s;umed as a fundamental principle in Chri&s;tianity. The fir&s;t of all the commandments is, 'Thou &s;halt have no other gods be&s;ides me;' and who was the &s;peaker, but Jehovah, the great creator of heaven and earth, the &s;ame great Being
<PB N="88" REF="027559_0083_0FD53602D9BA1710">
who in the New Te&s;tament is &s;tiled the <Q>God and the father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</Q> and &s;urely not Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf; becau&s;e then there would be no &s;uch per|&s;on as God the father at all; whereas the apo&s;tle &s;ays, <Q>To us there is one God, even the Father; and one me|diator between God and men, the man Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</Q></P>
<P>Again, in all the civil e&s;tabli&s;hments of Chri&s;tianity, the character of the one God and father of all has been greatly deba&s;ed by the idea of his arbitrarily &s;electing cer|tain individuals of the human race, as the objects of his e&s;pecial favour, while all the re&s;t are left under an irre|ver&s;ible &s;entence of condemnation; and al&s;o by the idea of the inexorablene&s;s of his di&s;po&s;ition, in not receiving penitent offenders, till &s;atisfaction had been made to his ju&s;tice by the death of Chri&s;t. Whereas his mo&s;t &s;olemn declarations to Mo&s;es, and all the prophets, as a <Q>God merciful and gracious,</Q> who 'for his name's &s;ake,' and 'his mercy's &s;ake' only, pardons offences, though ever &s;o great; and all the di&s;cour&s;es and parables of our Saviour, e&s;pecially his mo&s;t in&s;tructive parable of the prodigal &s;on, exhibit him in a very different and much more amiable light, as requiring no atonement, or &s;atisfaction what|ever, be&s;ides the repentance, and return, of the wor&s;t of &s;inners.</P>
<P>If we have any real value for Chri&s;tianity, we &s;hould exert our&s;elves to free it from the&s;e great incumbrances, which have already done it the greate&s;t injury, and en|dangered its very exi&s;tence. And if other well-meaning per&s;ons, from the fault of their education, and early im|pre&s;&s;ions, exert them&s;elves with great zeal in maintaining the&s;e &s;purious doctrines, we ought to &s;hew no le&s;s zeal

in favour of the great truths of which they are an infringe|ment. If they imagine that they maintain the honour of Chri&s;t by a&s;&s;erting his divinity, are not we maintaining the honour of God, by refu&s;ing to allow any being what|ever to &s;hare with him in tho&s;e honours, which he has declared that he will not give to another?</P>
<P>Let this, however, be done with all due allowance for the innocent prejudices of others; &s;o as to think no wor&s;e of the moral characters of men, or their final &s;tate, on account of any mere difference of opinion. True piety and benevolence, or the love of God and of our neigh|bour, to produce which is the great object of all religion, are not confined to Unitarians; though, thinking more favourably of the character of the Supreme Being, and not thinking any man the object of his di&s;plea&s;ure on ac|count of his opinions, the&s;e great virtues, the foundation of all the re&s;t, may be expected to find an ea&s;ier entrance into our brea&s;ts, than into tho&s;e of Calvini&s;ts and Trinita|rians, who, thinking tho&s;e who differ from them to be the objects of the divine abhorrence, may imagine that they cannot do wrong in entertaining the &s;ame &s;entiments con|cerning them; and this is the foundation of all per&s;ecution.</P>
<P>It is to the honour of this &s;ociety, an honour which I hope you will never lo&s;e, to be generally under&s;tood to hold the Chri&s;tian faith in the purity that I have de&s;cribed; having obtained the honourable denomination of an <HI>Unita|rian Society.</HI> For this implies all the re&s;t. The opinions of &s;ingle per&s;ons are often overlooked, or di&s;regarded; but a <HI>Chri&s;tian church</HI> is as <HI>a city &s;et on an hill, that cannot be hid;</HI> and when the&s;e churches &s;hall become numerous (and they are continually increa&s;ing) they cannot fail to attract uni|ver&s;al

attention. And this cannot but operate in the mo&s;t favourable manner for the intere&s;t of Chri&s;tianity in gene|ral. Indeed, it is &s;ufficiently obvious at this day, that it cannot &s;tand on any other ground.</P>

Having now clo&s;ed my di&s;cour&s;e to the proper congre|gation, I &s;hall take the liberty to addre&s;s a few words to the many &s;trangers, who, as I expected, I perceive to be pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of you, I pre&s;ume, are come hither from an inno|cent curio&s;ity to &s;ee and hear a per&s;on of whom you have heard much evil, and perhaps &s;ome good, and whom you do not expect to &s;ee or hear any more. Others, though I hope not many, may have come for &s;ome le&s;s innocent pur|po&s;e. The&s;e, let them have come whenever they plea&s;ed, mu&s;t have found them&s;elves di&s;appointed; and I hope agreeably &s;o; as in&s;tead of finding any occa&s;ion of harm to me, they may have found &s;ome good to them&s;elves. Nothing el&s;e can they have heard here; nothing but what is calculated to confirm the faith of all Chri&s;tians, and to inculcate tho&s;e &s;entiments of the heart, and that conduct in life, which are the proper fruits of that faith. All the doctrines that have been taught here, are tho&s;e relating to the being, the attributes, and the providence of God; the divine mi&s;&s;ions of Mo&s;es, and the prophets, of Chri&s;t and the apo&s;tles, and that future &s;tate of righteous retribution, which they preached. The&s;e great articles of faith you have heard not only a&s;&s;erted, but, if you have attended frequently, repeatedly proved by rational arguments.</P>
<P>This a per&s;on di&s;po&s;ed to cavil will allow; but he may &s;ay that he has likewi&s;e heard many things heretical, and offen&s;ive to him. This is very po&s;&s;ible: for every tenet contrary to that which any particular per&s;on has been u&s;ed to con&s;ider as true, will, of cour&s;e, be by him <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> fal&s;e, and therefore heretical, and more or le&s;s offen&s;ive. But are we not at liberty in this country to think and judge
<PB N="92" REF="027559_0087_0FD5360B46275140">
for our&s;elves? And as to every rea&s;onable cau&s;e of offence, all doctrines are to be judged of by their moral tendency, agreeably to the rule of our Saviour, <Q>By their fruits ye &s;hall know them.</Q></P>
<P>Now, what is the apparent moral tendency of the doctrines concerning God, and his moral government, that have been con&s;tantly taught in this place, but a life of obedience to his will? And is this moral tendency le&s;&s;ened by the belief that this God is <HI>one Being;</HI> or is it at all improved, or &s;trengthened, by the belief of there being <HI>three per&s;ons in the Godhead?</HI> On the contrary, is not the under&s;tanding confounded, and di&s;tracted, by the very attempt (which, after all, mu&s;t be unavailing) to reconcile the doctrine of <HI>three divine per&s;ons,</HI> with the fundamental doctrine of the &s;criptures, that there is but <HI>one God.</HI> And by what conceivable operation can the temper and di&s;po|&s;ition of mind be improved by &s;uch confu&s;ion of ideas, and &s;uch embarra&s;&s;ment; to &s;ay nothing of the ab&s;urdity, and impiety, of the doctrine?</P>
<P>You have heard great &s;tre&s;s laid upon the doctrine of the <HI>divinity of Chri&s;t.</HI> But be&s;ides that this is plainly &s;et|ting up another God than the <HI>one</HI> God and Father of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; what is gained by it? Are the doctrines and pre|cepts of the go&s;pel of le&s;s force becau&s;e the per&s;ons who taught them were not them&s;elves gods? On this principle, the law of Mo&s;es would have no obligation; and every thing taught by the apo&s;tles, who certainly were not gods, mu&s;t be di&s;regarded; whereas, it is <HI>the authority</HI> by which doctrines are taught, and not the <HI>per&s;ons,</HI> or <HI>in&s;truments,</HI> by whom they are taught, that is to be regarded; and this authority we all con&s;ider as properly divine.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="027559_0088_0FD5360D548CD958">
La&s;tly, will the human character &s;u&s;tain any injury with re&s;pect to his love of <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>equity,</HI> in con&s;equence of being taught that God, whom we are to re&s;emble, is im|partial in his regards to all his creatures of mankind, and &s;hews no e&s;pecial favour to any but for their &s;uperior vir|tue? Or will any man be le&s;s kind, or merciful, by believ|ing God to be more &s;o? Making the Divine Being our pattern, and pray that he would <Q>forgive us as we forgive others,</Q> &s;hall we not be even more di&s;po&s;ed to en|tertain proper &s;entiments towards our offending brother, when we are taught that if he only <HI>repent</HI> we mu&s;t forgive him; rather than if we were to be led, in imitation of the &s;uppo&s;ed conduct of God, to demand &s;ome other atone|ment, or &s;atisfaction, of him?</P>
<P>The&s;e, however, are the mo&s;t offen&s;ive doctrines that have ever been heard from this place, or inculcated in any of my writings. Judge then your&s;elves of the ground of the offence that has been taken.</P>
<P>As to the charge of <HI>&s;edition,</HI> nothing that can, by any con&s;truction, be &s;uppo&s;ed to have that tendency has ever been delivered from this pulpit; unle&s;s it be &s;edition to teach what the apo&s;tles taught before, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that we are 'to obey God rather than man,' and that in what relates to <HI>religion,</HI> and <HI>con&s;cience,</HI> we di&s;claim all human authority, even that of king, lords, and commons. In the&s;e things we acknowledge only one father, even God, and one ma|&s;ter, even Chri&s;t, the me&s;&s;enger, or amba&s;&s;ador, of God. If any doctrine be really fal&s;e, being contrary to rea&s;on and the &s;criptures, it is not an act of parliament that can make it true. Or, if any action be morally wrong, as being contrary to natural ju&s;tice and equity, it is not an act
<PB N="94" REF="027559_0089_0FD536103680AEB8">
of parliament that can make it be right. But while we thus render 'to God the things that are God's,' we render to 'Cae&s;ar the things that are Cae&s;ar's.' We are '&s;ubject to every' civil <Q>ordinance of man for the Lord's &s;ake,</Q> though not to their ordinances relating to <HI>religion.</HI> And whether we think any particular civil regulations to be wi&s;e, or not (and with re&s;pect to things of this nature, as well as others, different men will think differently) we &s;ubmit to the deci&s;ion of the majority, and are the friends of peace and good order.</P>
<P>Learn, then, not to give ear to mere calumny; but, ac|cording to the old Engli&s;h maxim, &s;uppo&s;e every man to be innocent till he be proved to be guilty, and in all matters of <HI>opinion,</HI> allow to others the liberty that you take your&s;elves. As to <HI>us,</HI> I tru&s;t that we have learned of Chri&s;t to <Q>ble&s;s them that cur&s;e us, and to pray for them that de&s;pitefully u&s;e, and per&s;ecute us.</Q> In the language of the liturgy we pray, that God would <Q>for|give our enemies, per&s;ecutors, and &s;landerers, and turn their hearts.</Q></P>
<P>Whether, then, you come as friends, or as enemies; whether we &s;hall ever &s;ee one another's faces again, or not, may God, who&s;e Providence is over all, ble&s;s, pre|&s;erve, and keep us. Above all, may we be pre&s;erved in the paths of virtue and piety, that we may have a happy meeting in that world, where error and prejudice will be no more; where all the ground of the party di&s;tinctions that &s;ub&s;i&s;t here will be taken away; where every mi&s;un|der&s;tanding will be cleared up, and the reign of truth and of virtue will be for ever e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY CHRISTIAN FRIENDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFTER &s;pending little more than two years with you, I find it expedient to leave you. But you will believe me when I a&s;&s;ure you, that this re&s;olution is not occa&s;ion|ed by any complaint that I have to make with re&s;pect to you. On the contrary, it was &s;ingularly generous in you to receive me when you did, driven, as I was, by violence from a favourite &s;ituation, and likely, from the prejudice of the times, to bring &s;u&s;picion on any congrega|tion that &s;hould make choice of me.</P>
<P>I have been happy to find that, though many (as, on &s;everal accounts, was very natural) objected to the con|duct of the majority, and left the &s;ociety, &s;ome partially, and others altogether, your numbers are not on the whole dimini&s;hed; and e&s;pecially that, contrary to the expecta|tions of mo&s;t, I have found a &s;ufficiently ample field of u&s;efulne&s;s in the cla&s;&s;es of young per&s;ons who have at|tended my lectures. The&s;e I leave with peculiar regret, having had peculiar &s;atisfaction in my attention to them, and in their improvement in religious knowledge; many of them, I doubt not, being well qualified to in&s;truct others. I hope that, in your choice of a &s;ucce&s;&s;or to me

(in which I pray for your be&s;t direction) their intere&s;t will not be neglected; more &s;ub&s;tantial good, I am from long experience, well per&s;uaded, being done in this way, than in the be&s;t di&s;charge of any other part of the mini&s;|terial duty.</P>
<P>Di&s;tant as is the country to which I find it expedient to remove, I &s;hall always rejoice to hear of your welfare, both as men, and as a Chri&s;tian &s;ociety. But infinitely happier will it be if our conduct in life be &s;uch, as &s;hall &s;ecure our meeting where <HI>the wicked will cea&s;e from troubling,</HI> where all the prejudices and mi&s;under&s;tandings that di&s;|turb the harmony of Chri&s;tians here will vani&s;h, and where we &s;hall never be &s;eparated from one another any more.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>REV. AND DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE have received with extreme concern the com|munication of your intention to re&s;ign your pa&s;toral office in this congregation; a connextion, from which we had promi&s;ed our&s;elves a great degree of benefit and hap|pine&s;s,
<PB N="97" REF="027559_0092_0FD5361908A72A08">
and which our &s;hort experience has abundantly ju&s;tified.</P>
<P>Whatever are the circum&s;tances which have induced you to think of removing, it is &s;ome con&s;olation to find, that it is not owing to any complaint to which we have given occa&s;ion; &s;ince you are plea&s;ed to be&s;tow more prai&s;e upon our conduct, than is its due.</P>
<P>We &s;hall always reflect, with the highe&s;t &s;atisfac|tion and with real gratitude, on your public &s;ervices among us; and on none more than your e&s;tabli&s;hment of lectures to the different cla&s;&s;es of young per&s;ons. Convinced, as we are, that the mo&s;t important advantages are likely to be derived to the ri&s;ing generation, from this in&s;titution, we &s;hall be careful to keep this great point in view, in the choice of your &s;ucce&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>In lamenting the &s;eparation which is about to take place between us, we feel particularly concerned, that your removal is to be to a country &s;o di&s;tant, as wholly to cut off our per&s;onal intercour&s;e with you: but we tru&s;t that Providence intends, by this event, to open to you a &s;cene of greater u&s;efulne&s;s; and it is this con&s;idera|tion, which better reconciles us to the great lo&s;s, which we our&s;elves are about to &s;u&s;tain.</P>
<P>Remote as may be the &s;ituation to which you find it expedient to remove, our hearts will go with you, and our affections embrace you; and nothing will afford us greater comfort, than to hear of your happine&s;s and increa&s;ing means of doing good. If the attachment of tho&s;e with whom you are about to live, is at all in pro|portion
<PB N="98" REF="027559_0093_0FD5361BB914A3F0">
to the regret of tho&s;e whom you are about to quit, you will have a &s;ure pledge of future &s;atisfac|tion.</P>
<P>We can take no merit to our&s;elves for having been ambitious to receive you into this &s;ociety, at a time when per&s;ecution raged again&s;t you; &s;ince we con&s;ulted here|in our duty and our be&s;t intere&s;ts. But it gives us the deepe&s;t regret, that it was in this country that you &s;hould have &s;uffered for the freedom of well-intentioned inquiries on &s;ubjects, re&s;pecting which every man is bound diligently to &s;earch for truth, and on which no man can a&s;&s;ume a right to think for his neighbour. Without free di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, truth cannot be a&s;certained, and it is the ab&s;ence of free di&s;cu&s;&s;ion which alone can perpetuate error.</P>
<P>Unable to deny the propriety of your retiring from a &s;cene of things, where you can promi&s;e to your&s;elf &s;o lit|tle comfort, or perhaps even &s;afety, we are at lea&s;t bound to bear te&s;timony to your irreproachable conduct, and to the patience with which you have borne your &s;ufferings. At the &s;ame time, we mu&s;t lament the &s;tigma which our nation will have brought upon it&s;elf, both with Europe and with po&s;terity, for having forced one of the fir&s;t of men, of Chri&s;tians, and of philo&s;ophers, to &s;eek in fo|reign countries an a&s;ylum from the in&s;ults and injuries, which he had experienced in his own in the pur&s;uit of religious truth.</P>
<P>In the plea&s;ing hope of a happy and indi&s;&s;oluble union hereafter, to which time cannot put an end, we remain

<P>YOUR intention of quitting this country being now made known, accept the warme&s;t &s;entiments of gra|titude from tho&s;e who, be&s;ides having benefited by your pa&s;toral &s;ervices, have al&s;o profited by your Lectures to young per&s;ons on the &s;ubject of religion.

Through your means we not only feel con|firmed in our faith in religion, but better di&s;po&s;ed to the performance of our various duties; the knowledge of which you have thus rendered clearer to our judgment, and the practice of which you have enforced to us by new and animating motive exemplary in your own life, and firm under per&s;ecution, you have hereby &s;uperadded the &s;tronge&s;t proof of the &s;incerity and the efficacy of your different precepts.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>REV. AND DEAR SIR.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR friends, the members of the Unitarian So|ciety, addre&s;s you on the pre&s;ent intere&s;ting occa&s;ion, to expre&s;s the regret with which they are penetrated, at your approaching departure from this country, and their warm|e&s;t wi&s;hes for your happine&s;s, in the place of your future de&s;tination.</P>
<P>So little as you have at any time interfered in national politics, it is but too obvious that the outrageous violence which you have experienced, and the atrocious calumnies which have been circulated with &s;uch unexampled in|du&s;try to injure your character, and to render your re&s;i|dence in your native country unplea&s;ant, and even un&s;afe, are entirely owing to that manly &s;pirit, with which you have avowed and defended, what you firmly believed to be the pure and rational doctrines of the go&s;pel; and to that truly Chri&s;tian zeal, with which you have entered your prote&s;t again&s;t tho&s;e prevailing errors, by which the religion of Je&s;us has been corrupted, and deba&s;ed.</P>
<P>But you, Sir, have in&s;tructed us, both by your doc|trine and example, to refer events to a higher cau&s;e: and while we regard with pity the conduct of men, who, un|der the cover of religious zeal, are gratifying their own perver&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, we al&s;o view them as in&s;truments, un|der the direction of a &s;uperior power, for the accompli&s;h|ment of purpo&s;es, the mo&s;t di&s;tant from their own inten|tions; and we bow with humble acquie&s;cence to the all|wi&s;e
<PB N="102" REF="027559_0097_0FD522E823ACFEE0">
wi&s;e di&s;po&s;ing will of Heaven. The hi&s;tory of the Chri&s;|tian church from its fir&s;t origin, through the revolutions of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive ages, has taught us this le&s;&s;on: that it is the order of Providence, that religious truth &s;hould be pro|mulgated and confirmed by the &s;ufferings of its mo&s;t en|lightened, and mo&s;t zealous advocates. In this part of the world, you, Sir, have kindled a re&s;plendent light, which no length of time, nor violence of oppo&s;ition, will be able to extingui&s;h; and you have been honoured as the in&s;trument of di&s;&s;u&s;ing religious knowledge, beyond almo&s;t any individual in later ages: we anticipate there|fore, with plea&s;ing hope, the exten&s;ive &s;ucce&s;s of your future labours in America. Favoured as we have been with your ri&s;ing, and your meridian lu&s;tre, we ought not to envy our brethren on the we&s;tern continent, the bene|fit of your evening &s;ay,</P>
<P>Hitherto, Sir, you have been our pattern in every me|ritorious exertion in the inve&s;tigation of religious truth, in every thing open and courageous in the profe&s;&s;ion of it. And when you are removed to a di&s;tant region, we tru&s;t that you will occa&s;ionally hear, that your illu&s;trious example has not been &s;o long exhibited before us in vain. We &s;hall think it our duty upon every proper occa&s;ion, and at all hazards, to avow our attachment to the genu|ine truths of the Chri&s;tian religion; and if, in the di&s;|charge of this duty, we &s;hould be expo&s;ed even to &s;everer per&s;ecutions than tho&s;e which you have encountered, we hope that our conduct will not di&s;grace the honourable cau&s;e in which we may &s;uffer.</P>
<P>We, Sir, rejoice with you, in the a&s;&s;urance of the ul|timate triumph of the kingdom of God, and of Chri&s;t,
<PB N="103" REF="027559_0098_0FD522E99B326700">
and of the univer&s;al dominion of truth and virtue, of or|der, liberty, and peace. And though we deplore the probable di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the intervening period, we are hap|py in the per&s;ua&s;ion, that infinite wi&s;dom will direct and controul the &s;torm, and that all the intermediate calami|ties will be as an evane&s;cent point, in compari&s;on with that glorious and happy &s;tate of things, of which they are the nece&s;&s;ary means, and to which they ultimately tend.</P>
<P>In the mean time, we &s;hall regard it as our indi&s;pen&s;a|ble duty, to prepare our&s;elves and others for the&s;e inter|e&s;ting events; not only by the zealous propagation of what we judge to be important truth, by every fair and honourable method, but likewi&s;e by exemplifying in our whole conduct, the tendency of the principles of the Chri&s;tian religion, when properly under&s;tood, to form the human mind to that &s;trength and elevation of charac|ter, in which the true dignity of our nature con&s;i&s;ts; and by which we may mo&s;t effectually put to &s;hame the ca|lumnies of malignity, the prejudices of ignorance, and the &s;coffs of infidelity.</P>
<P>That your voyage may be pro&s;perous, that your future lot may be happy, beyond the mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations of your warme&s;t friends; and that your &s;phere of u&s;eful|ne&s;s may be widely extended, and prolonged to the mo&s;t di&s;tant period of human exertion, is the ardent wi&s;h, and &s;ervent prayer, of</P>

<P>We have beheld with mingled indignation and regret, that &s;pirit of per&s;ecution which kindled the flames of ninety-one, &s;preading through the realm its baneful influ|ence, and pur&s;uing into his retreat, the friend and orna|ment of his country.</P>
<P>A &s;pirit which was thought, in this country at lea&s;t, to be for ever extinct, in&s;piring its barbarous violence into a lawle&s;s mob, drove you from this place, and broke tho&s;e bonds, which form the &s;acred connexion of a pa&s;tor with his flock.</P>
<P>Wanton in malice, the &s;ame &s;pirit has continued to per|&s;ecute you with private mole&s;tation, and with public ca|lumny. The pro&s;tituted abilities of Mr. Burke have in|du&s;triou&s;ly &s;eized each public occa&s;ion of exciting again&s;t you the public odium, while the dark a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating &s;pirit of anonymous abu&s;e, has been bu&s;y in the public prints, and found means to a&s;&s;ail and wound the tranquillity of your mo&s;t private retirements.</P>
<P>From a country where you have met with inju&s;tice in|&s;tead of reward, with calumny and per&s;ecution in&s;tead of prai&s;e and e&s;teem&mdash;we cannot wonder you &s;hould depart.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="027559_0100_0FD523B733E03278">
The hope, that in America you will find that a&s;ylum which is here denied you; the confidence, that a free country will receive a veteran &s;on of liberty, with all the re&s;pect that is due to his worth; the belief that tho&s;e who have fought and bled for their own rights will reverence one who has been deprived of <HI>his;</HI> the certainty, that the implacable enemies of liberty will never permit you, in this country, to enjoy repo&s;e; and the &s;trong &s;u&s;picion, that they would gladly &s;eize an opportunity, to aim not only at your per&s;onal freedom, but even at your life it|&s;elf,&mdash;reconcile us to the pro&s;pect of your departure, by demon&s;trating its nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>Wherever you go, renown will attend you. In Eng|land alone are you calumniated. In every other land, each grateful &s;cience will crowd around, and offer a gar|land to him, who&s;e genius has enlarged their &s;phere, or added to their &s;tability. Liberty will warmly welcome you to any of her dominions. Virtue and Religion will hail, with joyful &s;miles, the arrival of their intrepid cham|pion, their ardent votary.</P>
<P>We have, on a former melancholy occa&s;ion, expre&s;&s;ed our &s;en&s;e of the &s;ervices you rendered us&mdash;we expre&s;&s;ed le&s;s than we felt, and we again &s;end you our thanks.&mdash;While tyranny will rejoice; while bigotry and &s;uper&s;ti|tion will clap their hands at your departure&mdash;all that have been enlightened by your labours will give, in the tribute of a &s;ilent tear, more than tho&s;e powers, with all their boa&s;ted influence, can be&s;tow on their mo&s;t favourite va&s;&s;als.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="027559_0101_0FD5361E8B1C3D00">
Though <HI>you</HI> depart, your <HI>labours</HI> remain. The propa|gation of truth is &s;ilent, and &s;low, but it is irre&s;i&s;tible. The feed that you have &s;trewn around, will not lie buri|ed in the earth for ever. It is ari&s;ing, and it will ari&s;e, till it ripen into a glorious harve&s;t.</P>
<P>To your talents, your integrity, and love of truth, we &s;hall, while we live, bear te&s;timony. We rejoice, that of the&s;e no enemy can deprive you. While it will afford con&s;olation to you to reflect, that no virtuous effort you ever made can po&s;&s;ibly be lo&s;t, it &s;hall be &s;ome con&s;ola|tion to us, that we have enjoyed, that we do &s;till enjoy, &s;o many of their effects.</P>
<P>Though the waters of a wide &s;ea will &s;oon roll between us&mdash;your example, your precepts, and your principles, &s;hall not be ab&s;ent. The&s;e &s;hall continue pre&s;ent in our minds, and &s;hall in&s;pire our conduct.</P>
<P>May he who curbs the ocean, who &s;tills the wild winds, and the tumultuous biliows, grant you a pro&s;perous pa&s;|&s;age, and &s;afely land you on the &s;hores of America.</P>
<P>Signed by the unanimous de&s;ire of a numerous meeting of &s;ub&s;cribers, belonging to the two &s;ocieties of Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters, a&s;&s;embling in the Union Chapel, Livery-&s;treet.</P>
