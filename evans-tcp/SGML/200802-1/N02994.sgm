<P>Al&s;o he had them teach the Children of Judah the U&s;e of the Bow.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN the latter part of this Chapter, we have a mournful and yet manly <HI>Poem,</HI> which was compo&s;ed by <HI>David</HI>; who was not only a <HI>mighty valiant Man, a man of War,</HI> but al&s;o <HI>the &s;weet P&s;almi&s;t of I&s;|rael,</HI> an <HI>accompli&s;hed Poet,</HI> and one that could <HI>play well on an In&s;trument.</HI></P>
<P>HE wrote this <HI>Military Elegy,</HI> on the mournful Occa&s;ion of the overthrow and daughter of &s;ome of the People of the Lord,
<PB N="6" REF="003589_0004_0FF833BF6260CFD0">
and particularly the <HI>tragical Death</HI> of <HI>Saul King of I&s;rael,</HI> and his <HI>beloved Jonathan the King's Son.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>There was <HI>War</HI> between the <HI>Phili&s;tines,</HI> who were a <HI>valiant warlike People,</HI> and the <HI>Children of I&s;rael.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saul the King, (as becomes a brave General</HI>) led forth his Armies him&s;elf to the War: He marched and (as we may &s;uppo&s;e) <HI>fought</HI> at the head of his <HI>armed Soldiers:</HI> He al&s;o took his <HI>Sons</HI> with him into the <HI>Camp</HI> and <HI>Field of Battle,</HI> and met the Forces of the <HI>Phili&s;tines.</HI></P>
<P>There en&s;ued a <HI>bloody Battle</HI> between the&s;e <HI>gallant Armies</HI>: and alas! <HI>the Race is not to the &s;wift, nor the Battle to the &s;trong.</HI></P>
<P>The Armies of the uncircumci&s;ed prevailed and got the Day, and <HI>I&s;rael fled before them, and fell down &s;lain on the Mountains of Gilboa.</HI> 1 Sam. 31. <HI>begin.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Phili&s;tines</HI> well knowing how to pur|&s;ue an Advantage, followed after <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and &s;lew the <HI>valiant</HI> and <HI>worthy Sons</HI> of the King, even <HI>Jonathan, Abinadab,</HI> and <HI>Malchi&s;hua</HI>; and they wounded <HI>Saul</HI> the Lord's anointed with an <HI>Arrow.</HI></P>
<P>Now when <HI>Saul</HI> &s;aw the downfall of his heroic Sons, and many of his valiant Sol|diers, the overthrow of his Armies, and him|&s;elf wounded, and had in vain, asked his Armour-bearer to put an end to his Life, and &s;o to his Angui&s;h and Mi&s;ery, he fell on his

own Sword and died, <HI>as if he had not been anointed with Oyl</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. 31 4.5. &amp; 11. v. of the Context.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>When the News of this was brought to <HI>David</HI> in <HI>Zicklag,</HI> by a young <HI>Amalekite, David and the Men that were with him rent their Cloths, and they mourned and wept and fa&s;ted until evening, for</HI> Saul <HI>and for</HI> Jonathan <HI>his Son, and for the People of the Lord, and for the Hou&s;e of I&s;rael, becau&s;e they were fallen by the Sword.</HI> Ver&s;e 11 &amp; 12 of our Context.</P>
<P>And when <HI>David</HI> had done Ju&s;tice on the <HI>Amalekite,</HI> and was retired, he gave further Vent to his noble Pa&s;&s;ions, in this mournful and yet &s;ublime <HI>Funeral Song,</HI> at the begin|ning of which &s;tand the Words of our Text.</P>
<P>In which he celebrates the <HI>Military Accom|pli&s;hments</HI> and <HI>Atchievements</HI> of the&s;e <HI>Heroes,</HI> and laments their Death.</P>
<P>The Elegy is intirely <HI>Military,</HI> as one ob|&s;erves <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rev. Mr. <HI>Symmes,</HI> in his <HI>Level lamented.</HI></NOTE>, and 'tis plain the de&s;ign of it was, to fire the Ambition of the <HI>Militia</HI> of <HI>Judah,</HI> and &s;tir up in them a <HI>Martial</HI> Spirit, to quick|en them by <HI>Military Exerci&s;es,</HI> to endeavour to <HI>excel in warlike Skill and Accompli&s;hments</HI>; that they might equal and excel the Skill and Valour of tho&s;e Worthies, and ri&s;e up in their &s;tead, and boldly carry on the <HI>War</HI> a|gain&s;t their Enemies, and avenge the Death of their <HI>King,</HI> his Sons, and the other valiant

Soldiers that fell with them; and retrieve the Honour and Credit they had lo&s;t by this overthrow.</P>
<P>Agreably,</P>
<P>In the Text, he <HI>bad them teach the Chil|dren of Judah the U&s;e of the Bow.</HI></P>
<P><Q>This, as <HI>Junius</HI> ob&s;erves, expre&s;&s;es the De&s;ign of <HI>David,</HI> that this Song might ex|cite and provoke them to addict them&s;elves to Martial Exerci&s;es, and to acquire Skill in the <HI>u&s;e of the Bow,</HI> which is here put for all warlike Weapons then in Fa&s;hion.</Q></P>
<P>And for the &s;ame Rea&s;on and with the &s;ame View he tells them, that <HI>good Soldiers</HI> are the <HI>Beauty of I&s;rael</HI>; he minds them of the Valour, of the Honour and Succe&s;s of <HI>Saul</HI> and <HI>Jonathan,</HI> and mentions other things in the Elegy.</P>
<P><HI>David</HI> was now upon the Death of <HI>Saul,</HI> not only <HI>Generali&s;&s;imo of the Forces of I&s;rael,</HI> and <HI>Captain of the Lord's Ho&s;ts,</HI> but the <HI>King of I&s;rael,</HI> tho' not yet in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Throne</HI> by the Act of <HI>Coronation.</HI></P>
<P>And notwith&s;tanding his Mourning, he was not forgetful of his Duty, nor unmindful of the Safety and Felicity, the Honour and Reputation of his Kingdom and People.</P>
<P>But at the &s;ame time that he publi&s;hes this Song, he &s;ends forth this wi&s;e and proper <HI>Order</HI> and Command, or publi&s;hes this <HI>Law</HI> (as one calls it) therewith, to the Officers of the <HI>Troops</HI> and <HI>trained Bands,</HI> and to all o|thers
<PB N="9" REF="003589_0007_0FF833C56B02A2A8">
concerned in tho&s;e Affairs in the Tribe of <HI>Judah</HI>; (as I may have occa&s;ion to ob|&s;erve hereafter) that they &s;hould take care that the Soldiers &s;hould be taught the Art, Skill and Practice of War, the U&s;e of <HI>Martial Weapons.</HI></P>
<P>He that writes this Hi&s;tory mentions this <HI>Order,</HI> as he enters on the Recitation of the <HI>Song,</HI> to the Honour of this great <HI>King.</HI></P>
<P>And I think our Text may well be under|&s;tood <HI>in this Sen&s;e,</HI> both becau&s;e of the Con|nection &amp; De&s;ign of this Story and <HI>Elegy,</HI> and becau&s;e of the Idiom and Phra&s;e of the <HI>Hebrew,</HI> (as far as I can judge of it) tho' there are great Men that &s;uppo&s;e this Expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>He bad them teach the Children of Judah the Bow,</HI> means, he bad them teach them this <HI>Song,</HI> to which he prefixes the Title, <HI>Ka&s;heth,</HI> or the <HI>Bow.</HI></P>
<P>I can't &s;atisfy my &s;elf with that Expo&s;i|tion; but allowing it, yet even the Patrons of it, allow the Poem to have the &s;ame View and De&s;ign, and &s;o the former Sen&s;e is &s;till good; and having good Authority on my &s;ide, I may be allowed to take my Text in that Sen&s;e.</P>
<P>And under&s;tanding it &s;o, we may ob&s;erve here,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Fir&s;t, Who it was, and what Character he &s;u&s;tained, who i&s;&s;ued out this Order or Command.</HI></P>
<P>Now 'twas the <HI>valiant and expert David,</HI> (who as was &s;aid) tho' taken from the Sheep|folds
<PB N="10" REF="003589_0008_0FF833C761F607E0">
of his Father in <HI>Bethlehem</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Sam 16.11. &amp; 2 Sam. 7.8.</NOTE>, was yet a very brave couragious and skilful Soldier; he had approved him&s;elf &s;uch an one, not only in the <HI>celebrated Action</HI> of &s;laying <HI>Goliah,</HI> the Champion of the <HI>Phili&s;tines, who was a man of war from his Youth,</HI> when <HI>David</HI> was but a <HI>&s;tripling</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. 17 chap.</NOTE>, but al&s;o in bringing in two hundred Foreskins of the <HI>Phili&s;tines</HI> at ano|ther Time <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. 18.22.</NOTE>, and now in the Slaughter of the <HI>Amalekites</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;&idagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. 30 chap.</NOTE>, and many other noble Ex|ploits which he had done.</P>
<P>And he was now the <HI>Captain General</HI> of the &s;tanding Forces of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and the King in&s;tead of <HI>Saul.</HI> It was this <HI>great Ma&s;ter of the Art of War,</HI> and chief Commander, that gave forth his Command to teach his Soldi|ers, his Subjects, the <HI>Military Art.</HI></P>
<P>And with what Propriety and Authority a Command comes from &s;uch an one! how chearfully will it be received and obeyed by Officers and Soldiers!</P>
<P><HI>Generals</HI> and <HI>Captains</HI> &s;hould be good <HI>Sol|diers.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Secondly, Ob&s;erve here, to whom this Or|der was &s;ent.</HI></P>
<P>And it plainly appears that it was not primarily to <HI>Common Soldiers</HI>; but it was ei|ther to the <HI>Magi&s;trates</HI> of <HI>Judah,</HI> in who&s;e power it was, <HI>by the King's Approbation,</HI> to make and execute the <HI>Martial Laws</HI>;</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="003589_0009_0FF833E729086CD0">Or to &s;uch Parents as had Sons capable of learning the <HI>Art of War,</HI> and able to go forth to <HI>War</HI>: Or rather to the <HI>Officers of the Armies,</HI> the <HI>Colonels, Captains, Lieutenants,</HI> and the like. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>vid.</HI> Poli Synop. in loc.</NOTE> <HI>Praefecti rei Militaris,</HI> &s;ays a Critick; the Officers, or tho&s;e that had the over&s;ight of Military Affairs.</P>
<P>The&s;e were pre&s;umed to be able to teach others, and received <HI>Orders</HI> agreably.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Thirdly, Ob&s;erve in the Text, the Per&s;ons to be taught,</HI> viz. the <HI>Children of Judah, the Sons of Judah,</HI> as in the Original: The young and effective Men, who were &s;uitable to be taught this Art.</P>
<P><HI>Judah</HI> was the <HI>Tribe</HI> to which <HI>David</HI> be|longed; and his chief Dependance was upon them for Martial Exploits, and for Con&s;tancy and Fidelity to their Prince: They were al&s;o a profe&s;&s;ing and religious People.</P>
<P><HI>They</HI> mu&s;t then be fir&s;t taught the <HI>Art of War</HI>; not that the other Tribes were to be neglected; a General will have his own Company good Soldiers.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Fourthly,</HI> Ob&s;erve here, the <HI>Order, Com|mand</HI> or Law it &s;elf; <HI>Teach them the Bow,</HI> or, the U&s;e of the Bow. Some, tho' not all Ex|po&s;itors, think this well &s;upplied in our Tran&s;lation, by adding the Words the <HI>U&s;e of,</HI> and the <HI>Bow</HI> was a Martial Weapon, much u&s;ed in tho&s;e Days. <HI>Jonathan</HI> is celebrated
<PB N="12" REF="003589_0010_0FF833C8ED8C6298">
in this <HI>Poem</HI> for his Skill in the u&s;e of it, and the Exploits he had done by it. He had before this, his <HI>Artillery</HI> and <HI>Bow.</HI> 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 20.40.</P>
<P><HI>David</HI> him&s;elf doubtle&s;s well under&s;tood it; and the <HI>Phili&s;tines</HI> were very expert and &s;ucce&s;sful in the u&s;e of it. By this they gained the Victory ju&s;t before mentioned o|ver <HI>I&s;rael</HI>: With the <HI>Bow</HI> they &s;lew <HI>Saul</HI> and his Sons.</P>
<P>'Tis po&s;&s;ible <HI>Archery</HI> was not &s;o much in u&s;e now among the Children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> as it had been; partly becau&s;e of the <HI>glorious Vic|tory David</HI> had lately obtained over <HI>Goliah</HI> with a <HI>Sling</HI> and <HI>Stone,</HI> and partly becau&s;e <HI>Slings</HI> were <HI>cheaper.</HI></P>
<P>But this was not out of U&s;e; for &s;ome of them who <HI>came to David to Zicklag, who were mighty Men, and helpers of the War,</HI> were arm|ed with <HI>Bows</HI> as well as <HI>Slings,</HI> 1 Chron. 12.1, 2.</P>
<P>But on this Occa&s;ion, that they might not be inferiour to their Enemies in any part of <HI>Military Skill,</HI> or the u&s;e of any Weapon, and that they might fight and overcome the Ene|mies with their own Weapons, they were to be taught a more exact and perfect Skill in the <HI>u&s;e of the Bow.</HI></P>
<P>Or as is generally thought, by <HI>Bow</HI> here is meant all <HI>Military In&s;truments,</HI> and &s;o the Command is in general, teach them all the <HI>Art of War,</HI> and the u&s;e of every <HI>warlike Weapon,</HI> but <HI>e&s;pecially &s;uch as will be of mo&s;t
<PB N="13" REF="003589_0011_0FF833CAE543EEA8">
Advantage to fight again&s;t the bloody Phili&s;tines,</HI> and enable them to avenge the Death of their <HI>King,</HI> and the other brave <HI>Soldiers</HI> that fell with him.</P>
<P>This experienced <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Commander</HI> knew very well of how much Importance it was to have a <HI>well di&s;ciplined Army,</HI> of &s;uch as were <HI>expert and skilful</HI> in the u&s;e of all <HI>Martial Weapons,</HI> to meet, fight and vanqui&s;h an Enemy that was &s;uch.</P>
<P>And 'tis not impo&s;&s;ible but &s;ome defect of <HI>Di&s;cipline</HI> and <HI>Skill</HI> among the Soldiers of <HI>Judah,</HI> or &s;ome dejection of Spirits on this Overthrow, might excite him the more at this Time to give out this <HI>Command.</HI></P>
<P>And what was then rea&s;onable, honourable and beautiful among a People, is &s;o now. If valiant and accompli&s;hed Soldiers were the Beauty and Safety of a People then, they are &s;o in our Days.</P>
<P>In further &s;peaking to the&s;e Words, I &s;hall (by Divine Help) briefly con&s;ider the&s;e three Things, (which naturally offer them&s;elves to our Thoughts) <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t, <HI>It is very de&s;irable, and what God's People ought to take care of, that their</HI> Sons <HI>be taught and trained up in the</HI> Military Art and Skill; <HI>or that they be</HI> expert, accompli&s;hed and valiant Soldiers.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>I &s;hall con&s;ider what Influence the Example in our Text may have on tho&s;e who have (in our Days) the</HI> Command <HI>of the</HI> Mili|tia. <HI>And</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="003589_0012_0FF833CC7471C418">Thirdly, <HI>That it is de&s;irable that a People be taught</HI> that Manner of warring, <HI>and Skill in u&s;ing tho&s;e</HI> Weapons of War, <HI>which may be of mo&s;t Service again&s;t the Enemies they have mo&s;t Apprehen&s;ions from.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I am to con&s;ider, that 'tis very de&s;i|rable, and what God's People ought to take care of, that their <HI>Sons</HI> be taught and trained up in the <HI>Military Art and Skill</HI>; or, that they be <HI>expert, accompli&s;hed and valiant Sol|diers.</HI></P>
<P>We &s;ee this was one of the very fir&s;t things this wi&s;e and prudent <HI>King</HI> took care of, af|ter he became <HI>King,</HI> to give Orders that his Subjects &s;hould bring up their <HI>Sons</HI> in <HI>Mili|tary Exerci&s;es,</HI> that they &s;hould teach them the <HI>Martial Art,</HI> and the u&s;e of <HI>warlike Wea|pons.</HI> He would have their <HI>young Men early</HI> taught it, and all grow more dexterous at it.</P>
<P>And he puts into their Hands at the &s;ame Time this <HI>Poem,</HI> not only to eterni&s;e the Me|mory of his <HI>Heroes,</HI> but to <HI>fire</HI> their <HI>martial Courage,</HI> and &s;tir them up to Emulation, and to fill them with de&s;ires of acquiring the <HI>Ho|nour</HI> and <HI>Glory</HI> which belongs to <HI>skilful</HI> and <HI>brave Soldiers.</HI></P>
<P>Agreably he gives this <HI>Command,</HI> as we may &s;uppo&s;e, not only to <HI>Soldiers</HI> and <HI>Field-Officers,</HI> but to the <HI>Civil Rulers,</HI> and to tho&s;e <HI>Parents</HI> that had <HI>Sons</HI> fit to be educated therein, as I have above ob&s;erved.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="003589_0013_0FF833CF5E779750">And there is as much Rea&s;on why our Sons at this Day &s;hould be taught this <HI>Skill</HI> and <HI>Art,</HI> as there was in the Days of <HI>David.</HI></P>
<P>We have &s;een and felt by unhappy Expe|rience, that a People's Enjoyment of Go&s;pel Privileges, is no effectual Security again&s;t <HI>E|nemies</HI> and <HI>Wars</HI>: The Time is not (we may fear) yet come, when <HI>Men may beat their Swords into Plow &s;hares, and their Spears into Pruning-hooks; that Nation &s;hall not lift up Sword again&s;t Nation, neither &s;hall they learn War any more</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. 2.4.

<P>The Advantage hereof might be un&s;peaka|ble.
