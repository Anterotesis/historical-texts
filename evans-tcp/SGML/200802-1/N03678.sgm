<P>_THIS anniver&s;ary Day which is now return'd upon us, may very well be call'd <HI>A Day which the</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P&s;al. 118. 24.</NOTE> <HI>Lord hath made;</HI> ina&s;much as He has given us the happy Oc|ca&s;ion of it, by putting our Fa|thers, and continuing us in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e invaluable Privileges, the Exer|ci&s;e whereof is the proper Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Day:
<PB N="2" REF="004498_0005_100D5A14ADA5D250">
And if we, and our People, do not <HI>rejoyce</HI> and &s;hew our&s;elves <HI>glad in it,</HI> with a religious as well as civil Joy, our Stupidity and Ingratitude will be an Evidence, how unworthy we are of the Favours of Heaven wherewith we are di&s;tingui&s;h'd.</P>
<P>WE again &s;ee <HI>the Princes,</HI> the Legi&s;lators <HI>of the People, even the People of the God of</HI> Abraham, <HI>gathered together;</HI> not only in the <HI>State-Hou&s;e</HI> to di&s;patch the publick Bu&s;ine&s;s, but in the <HI>Lord's-Hou&s;e</HI> to pay Him their publick Homage, and to learn their Duty to Him <HI>by inquiring in his Temple:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P&s;al. 47, 9.</NOTE> And &s;ince <HI>the Shields of the Earth do belong unto God,</HI> it is fit He &s;hould in this Way be <HI>exalted</HI> by them.</P>
<P>OUR pre&s;ent Rulers de&s;ire this publick Day may continue to wear the Garb of Religion, not only <HI>out of Cu&s;tom,</HI> and in Conformity to the Practice of their Ance&s;tors; but, we tru&s;t, <HI>from a Sen&s;e of Duty,</HI> and becau&s;e they inherit a good Mea&s;ure of the &s;ame Spirit of Piety and Devotion, which was the di&s;tingui&s;hing Glory of the Fathers of our Country.</P>
<P>I know your <HI>Excellency,</HI> and the honourable <HI>Coun&s;ellers,</HI> who have order'd me into the &s;acred Desk on this great Occa&s;ion, don't expect from me, either an Addre&s;s of Compliment, or a Lecture in Politicks; both of which are as di&s;tant from my Genius, as they would be di&s;agreable to my Cha|racter. That which you have called me to is, as a Go&s;pel Mini&s;ter, to direct you from the Word of God, and remember you of your Duty as Chri&s;tian Magi&s;trates; which I &s;hall accordingly endeavour, by divine Help, with all Fidelity, and a proper

Deference: And I don't know how I can better do this, than from the &s;olemn Pa&s;&s;age I have ju&s;t read.</P>
<P>IF then you are come together to <HI>hear what God the Lord has to &s;ay unto you,</HI> the Me&s;&s;age bro't you in his Name, by the unworthie&s;t of his Mi|ni&s;ters, is this, <HI>Serve the</HI> LORD <HI>with Fear, and rejoyce with Trembling.

<P>THE <HI>P&s;alm</HI> of which our Text is the Clo&s;e, is a prophetick Di&s;cour&s;e of the Kingdom of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah.</HI> It foretells the <HI>Oppo&s;ition</HI> which would be given to that Kingdom, when it &s;hould be &s;et up in the World. Tho' the Laws of this Kingdom, and the Admini&s;tration of it, are every way &s;uited to make the Subjects thereof ea&s;y and happy; and the Nature of it is &s;uch, that if it did univer&s;ally obtain, it would make the Kingdoms of this World re&s;emble the Kingdom of Heaven; for it <HI>con&s;i&s;ts in Righteou&s;|ne&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 14. 7</NOTE> and Peace, and Joy in the Holy Gho&s;t;</HI> yet &s;uch are the Prejudices of Men, that they not only refu&s;e to become the Subjects of this Kingdom them&s;elves, but do their utmo&s;t to prevent its E&s;tabli&s;hment and Spread in the World. And this Oppo&s;ition is <HI>general,</HI> made by all &s;orts of Per|&s;ons; not only the common Rout, from whom lit|tle better is to be expected, but the Kings and Ru|lers are engag'd in it; as if they tho't the Reign of Chri&s;t would eclip&s;e their Glory, and dimini&s;h their Authority. The&s;e back their Strength and Power with Policy and Coun&s;el. <HI>The Kings of the Earth &s;et them&s;elves,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ver. 2, 3.</NOTE> <HI>and the Rulers take Coun&s;el
<PB N="4" REF="004498_0007_100D5A18F33613B0">
together, again&s;t the Lord, and again&s;t his Anointed, &s;aying, Let us break their Bands a&s;under, and ca&s;t away their Cords from us.</HI></P>
<P>BUT for the Comfort of all tho&s;e who have heartily e&s;pous'd the Intere&s;ts of Chri&s;t, and are the faithful Subjects of his Kingdom, the Vanity and <HI>Un&s;ucce&s;sfulne&s;s</HI> of this Oppo&s;ition follow. Their Attempts will certainly be defeated, and their Coun&s;els baffled, however confident they may be of carrying their Point. The mo&s;t High controls their Rage, and derides their Folly. <HI>Why do the Heathen rage,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. &amp; 4. v.</NOTE> <HI>and the People imagine a vain Thing? He that &s;itteth in the Heaven&punc; &s;hall laugh, the Lord &s;hall have them in Deri&s;ion.</HI> For the Thing they attempt is not only unlikely, but impo&s;&s;ible. The Kingdom of Chri&s;t is better e&s;tabli&s;h'd than any of the Monarchies of the World. It is founded upon an irrevocable Decree of God the Father, from which he cannot recede in Point of Honour. This eternal Purpo&s;e and Re&s;olve, which lay hid in the divine Coun&s;els from the Days of Eternity, is publi&s;h'd with Solemnity:<NOTE PLACE="marg">6, 7, 8. v.</NOTE> <HI>Yet have I &s;et my King upon my holy Hill of Zion. I will declare the Decree; the Lord hath &s;aid unto me, Thou art my Son, this Day have I begotten thee. Ask of me, and I &s;hall give thee the Heathen for thine Inheritance, and the utmo&s;t Parts of the Earth for thy Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</HI> Nay; The Oppo&s;ition will i&s;&s;ue not only in a vexatious and &s;hameful Di&s;appointment, but in the dreadful, ut|ter and irrecoverable Ruin of all that are in the cur&s;ed Confederacy. The Honours of this divine King will be &s;ufficiently vindicated; and they who would not &s;ubmit to his gracious Sceptre, &s;hall be broken with his iron Rod.<NOTE PLACE="marg">v. 9.</NOTE> <HI>Thou &s;halt break them
<PB N="5" REF="004498_0008_100D5A1A9B5D8DE0">
with a Rod of Iron, thou &s;halt da&s;h them in Pieces like a Potters Ve&s;&s;el;</HI> &s;o <HI>&s;uddenly, ea&s;ily,</HI> and <HI>irrepa|rably.</HI></P>
<P>Now our Text is the <HI>Application</HI> of all this, by way of Coun&s;el and Admonition, to Per&s;ons of the highe&s;t Rank and Order in the World, as more e&s;pecially concerned in it. And here we may ob&s;erve, 1, The Per&s;ons to whom the Coun&s;el is addre&s;s'd. 2, The Coun&s;el that is given them. And 3, The Arguments and Motives with which it is enforc'd. The&s;e three Divi&s;ions of the Text may be the general Heads of our Di&s;cour&s;e: And, if I mi&s;take not, they will furni&s;h us with Matter proper for this Occa&s;ion; and naturally &s;ugge&s;t to us &s;uch weighty Things, as will concern every Per|&s;on of whatever Degree or Station, in this large A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>I. THE fir&s;t Thing then that falls under our Ob&s;ervation is, <HI>The Per&s;ons to whom the Coun&s;el in our Text is addre&s;s'd:</HI> And the&s;e are the <HI>Kings</HI> and <HI>Judges of the Earth.</HI> That is, Sovereign Princes and their Under-Officers; all Magi&s;trates, both the &s;upream and the &s;ubordinate; tho&s;e that have the legi&s;lative, and tho&s;e that have the ex|ecutive Power, in the Government of any People.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Office of the Magi&s;tracy</HI> is here &s;uppos'd at lea&s;t; the <HI>In&s;titution of Government</HI> conc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ed to if not a&s;&s;erted: For &s;ome Per&s;ons are here addre&s;s'd as ve&s;ted with Authority and Rule.</P>
<P>NOTHING in the World is plainer than this, That it is the Mind and Will of God that there
<PB N="6" REF="004498_0009_100D5A1C222CFA48">
&s;hould be Magi&s;tracy in the World; that Men &s;hould be govern'd by Laws and Polity, and kept in Order by this Means.</P>
<P>SURELY no one can doubt whether the Foun|dation of civil Government is laid in divine In&s;titu|tion, who but reads, without a Comment, &s;uch Texts as the&s;e. Prov. 8. 15. <HI>By me Kings reign, and Princes decree Ju&s;tice: By me Princes rule, and Nobles, even all the Judges of the Earth.</HI> Rom. 13. 1, 2. <HI>Let every Soul be &s;ubject unto the higher Powers. For there is no Power but of God: The Powers that be are ordained of God. Who&s;oever therefore re&s;i&s;teth, re&s;i&s;teth the Ordinance of God.</HI> 1 Pet. 2. 13, 14. <HI>Submit your &s;elves to every Or|dinance of Man for the Lord's &s;ake. Whether it be to the King as &s;upream, or to Governors as &s;ent by him; for the Puni&s;hment of Evil Doers, and for the Prai&s;e of them that do well. For &s;o is the Will of God</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>AND this is the Dictate of <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> as well as the Voice of Scripture. The very Light of Nature gives a &s;ufficient Indication of the Mind of God in this Matter: For all Nations, how barbarous &s;o|ever, have united in &s;ome Kind of Government or other, for their common Peace and Safety; nor can any Number of Men continue any Time, with|out &s;omething of Law and Rule; which &s;hews that Government is from God as the Author of Nature.</P>
<P>IT is as truly as commonly &s;aid, <HI>Nothing is more unequal than Equality.</HI> Neither the Beauty nor Benefit of the World will allow it. The Notion
<PB N="7" REF="004498_0010_100D5A1E5CD8B460">
of <HI>Leveli&s;m</HI> has as little Foundation in Nature as in Scripture.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 15 41.</NOTE> If we look up to the <HI>Heavens, there is one Glory of the Sun, and another Glory of the Moon, and another Glory of the Stars;</HI> neither are the&s;e of the &s;ame Magnitude and Lu&s;tre, but <HI>one Star differeth from another Star in Glory.</HI> And if we look round the <HI>Earth,</HI> we &s;ee it is not ca&s;t into a Level; it has Mountains and Plains, Hills and Vallies. Even &s;o in the <HI>political World,</HI> there are the Di&s;tinctions of Superiours and Inferiours, Rulers and Ruled, publick and private Orders of Men: Some &s;it on the Throne of Maje&s;ty, &s;ome at the Council Table, and &s;ome on the Bench of Ju&s;tice; and &s;ome hold &s;ubordinate Places of Pow|er; while others &s;erve their Generation only in a private Capacity.</P>
<P>AMONG the native Spirits of Heaven, the holy <HI>Angels,</HI> who have their abode in the Realms of Light and Purity above, where there are no Lu&s;ts to be re&s;train'd, it is &s;uppos'd there are not only different Degrees of Excellence, but different Offi|ces and Employments. It has been tho't a &s;uffici|ent Foundation for this Conjecture, that we read of <HI>Thrones,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Col. 1. 16.</NOTE> <HI>Dominions, Principalities and Powers,</HI> in the heavenly Places. And if <HI>Man</HI> had retain'd his primitive Holine&s;s, and his Nature not been &s;tain'd with Sin as now it is, there would doubt|le&s;s have been Government in this lower World, and within the Circle of Paradi&s;e it &s;elf; not <HI>co|ercive</HI> or <HI>punitive,</HI> for there could then be no "Occa&s;ion for that; but directive, and con&s;ervative" of Superiority and Inferiority, &s;uch as will be in the heavenly State after our Saviour &s;hall have <HI>delivered up the Kingdom to God, even the Father.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="004498_0011_100D5A20875CC400">
BUT how nece&s;&s;ary is Government, even in the &s;everer Re&s;traints of it, for Man in his pre&s;ent fallen and corrupt State? To how much greater a Height wou'd Wickedne&s;s ri&s;e, if there were none to be a <HI>Terror to evil Doers?</HI> If all Men were left to their unre&s;train'd Liberty, what an uncomfortable and dangerous Place would this World be? What vexatious and unea&s;y Compa|nions wou'd Men be to one another? And how wou'd this Earth re&s;emble the Hell of the Damned? They that now enjoy the Plea&s;ures and Advanta|ges of Society, wou'd be ready to wi&s;h they could dwell &s;olitary in the Wilderne&s;s. And good Men more e&s;pecially wou'd have Rea&s;on to utter <HI>David'</HI>s Complaint, with a heavy Accent, <HI>Wo is me, that I &s;ojourn in</HI> Me&s;ech,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P&s;a. 120. 5.</NOTE> <HI>that I dwell in the Tents of</HI> Ke|dar! Among a People rude and barbarous, hate|ful and hating; govern'd not by Rea&s;on and Re|ligion, but only by Will and Lu&s;t.</P>
<P>THEREFORE God's good Will to Men, and Concern for their Happine&s;s, appears next to the Go&s;pel and the Mini&s;try of it, in the <HI>In&s;titution of Magi&s;tracy;</HI> his appointing that Men, in their pre&s;ent State, &s;hou'd be govern'd by Men. If the World was to be con&s;tantly govern'd by God in a more <HI>immediate</HI> way, by a Voice from Heaven, and &s;uch awful Appearances of the divine Maje&s;ty as tho&s;e on Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> when he delivered his Law to his People <HI>I&s;rael;</HI> as this would not &s;o well agree with that State of Probation the World is now in, in which Men are to <HI>walk by Faith and not by Sight,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 5. 7.</NOTE> &s;o it would not &s;uit the pre&s;ent Frailty of our Nature.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="004498_0012_100D5A22B6C47A30">
THE People of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> found this by Experience, in the Day when God promulg'd his Law to them, in a way &s;uited to his own Maje&s;ty and Greatne&s;s. They could not bear it. They were &s;truck into &s;uch Amazement and Terror, as to make it their humble Reque&s;t that he would plea&s;e to go into a Method of Government more &s;uted to Spirits in Fle&s;h;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 20. 19.</NOTE> and that they might <HI>no more hear the Voice of the Lord, lea&s;t they &s;hou'd die:</HI> And God granted their Reque&s;t, and in Conde&s;ention to their Weak|ne&s;s and Infirmity, when the Government over <HI>I&s;rael</HI> was a <HI>Theocracy,</HI> he u&s;ed the Mini&s;try of Men in the Management of it. Truly, the ac|curate Wi&s;dom and compa&s;&s;ionate Goodne&s;s of God are &s;een, in governing as well as teaching us by <HI>Men</HI> like our &s;elves.</P>
<P>THIS does not indeed le&s;&s;en the <HI>Obligations to Obedience;</HI> for <HI>he that de&s;pi&s;eth, de&s;pi&s;eth not Man but God:</HI> But it is a very good Rea&s;on why we &s;hou'd make favourable Allowances for the Defects and Failings of Rulers. They are <HI>but Men;</HI> of the &s;ame Make and Con&s;titution with Others, of like Pa&s;&s;ions and Appetites, under all the Weak|ne&s;&s;es and Corruptions of human Nature &s;ince the Fall, and be&s;et with the like and with &s;ome pecu|liar Temptations. We &s;hould not therefore place an undue Confidence in them, nor expect too much from them. To be &s;ure, a perfect Conduct and Admini&s;tration we mu&s;t not look for. And their Mi&s;takes and Mi&s;management, whether in private or publick Life, &s;hou'd not be too &s;everely cen&s;ur'd. To <HI>pray more</HI> for Rulers, and <HI>talk le&s;s</HI> again&s;t them, wou'd many Times be a <HI>better Way</HI> to get &s;ome Things amended.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="004498_0013_100D5A250F987268">
I don't mean that out of Reverence to Autho|rity, we &s;hou'd re&s;ign common Under&s;tanding, and the publick Intere&s;t, to Men in Power: Nor wou'd I be tho't to deny the Right which every private Man, as he is a Member of the Body, and his Intere&s;t is involv'd in that of the Publick, has to judge of the Conduct of publick Affairs. No; <HI>I am too deep in the Principles of Liberty,</HI> to mean any thing like this. But this I &s;ay, the Cen&s;ure of Rulers &s;hould be in matters of which we are able in &s;ome good Mea&s;ure to form a Judgment, upon Things apparent, and where Facts may be compar'd together; and always manag'd with De|cency, and temper'd with Charity.&mdash;Nor &s;hou'd we pre&s;ently vote tho&s;e to be ill Men, Enemies of their Country, regardle&s;s of its Intere&s;ts, or de&s;ign|ing its Ruin, who don't judge with the Populace, or go into the Mea&s;ures which others think be&s;t. For Per&s;ons equal in Integrity and Love to their Country, may judge very differently about the publick Intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>WHAT we have &s;poken of the divine In&s;tituti|on of Government, you all under&s;tand to be meant of <HI>Government it &s;elf,</HI> and not of any particular Form or Model of it: For one is no more appoint|ed by God than another; but every People are left to judge for them&s;elves, to frame &s;uch a Con|&s;titution as may be&s;t an&s;wer the Ends of Govern|ment for them, and to alter and change <HI>that too</HI> at Di&s;cretion, and by common Con&s;ent.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Kingly Government</HI> is mentioned in our Text; but is not to be under&s;tood exclu&s;ive of o|ther Forms. And all Per&s;ons are for Con&s;cience &s;ake to yield Obedience to the Laws and Magi&s;|trates

under which they live, and from which they receive the Benefit of Protection; whether in Kingdoms or Common Wealths; and whether the Government does or does not de&s;cend by he|reditary Right.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Model of Government would not &s;uit every People; their Genius, Scituation, and other Circum&s;tances are &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">rious. It is therefore an In&s;tance of the Kindne&s;s of God that he has not pre&s;crib'd one for all Nations. And by the various Forms of civil Government, which there are among the Nations of the Earth, the Wi&s;dom of God in the Government of the World in general, is ren|dred the more illu&s;trious and admirable.</P>
<P>OF the various Forms of civil Government which are in the World, &s;ome are undoubtedly <HI>much better</HI> than others, and it is a greater Happi|ne&s;s to live under one than another of them. The Con&s;ideration of this &s;hou'd make us thankful for our Privilege as ENGLISH-MEN; which is to live under the happie&s;t Con&s;titution in the World, if compar'd in its proper Lineaments with other Governments.

<P>A Servant of Chri&s;t is one who has parted with his <HI>old Ma&s;ters;</HI> fallen off from his Allegiance to,<NOTE PLACE="marg">I&s;a. 26. 13.</NOTE> and renounc'd the Service of tho&s;e <HI>other Lords</HI> which <HI>have had Dominion over him;</HI> Satan and the World.</P>

<P>HE <HI>obeys all his Laws,</HI> and makes <HI>his Will</HI> the Rule of all his Actions; how contrary &s;oever to his own Will or Humour, Ea&s;e or Intere&s;t.

<P>1&s;t REASON or Argument may be taken from the <HI>Wi&s;dom of &s;uch a Conduct. Be</HI> wi&s;e <HI>now there|fore, O ye Kings: be</HI> in&s;tructed <HI>ye Judges of the Earth. Serve the Lord,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>WISDOM</HI> is a very requi&s;ite Qualification in Rulers. Without this they will make but a poor Figure, and both their Per&s;ons and Authority fall into Contempt. Now, to &s;erve the Lord, <HI>Behold! this is Wi&s;dom.</HI> When Rulers do <HI>this,</HI> they en|gro&s;s all the Rules of Policy into one.</P>
<P>FOR,</P>
<P>THIS is the way <HI>to have the Pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t with them in their Admini&s;tration,</HI> to direct their Coun&s;els, and &s;ucceed their Endeavours for the publick Good; without which their own Policy and Power will be in vain; the wi&s;e&s;t Schemes will be baffled, and the mo&s;t promi&s;ing Enterprizes

defeated. Whatever the <HI>wi&s;e Men after the Fle&s;h</HI> may think, the Rules of Religion &s;teadily pur&s;u'd by tho&s;e entru&s;ted with the publick Affairs of a People, will be found to conduce more to the true Ends of Government, than all the Maxims of carnal Policy. 1 Sam. 23. 3, 4. <HI>He that ruleth over Men mu&s;t be ju&s;t, ruling in the Fear of God: And he &s;hall be as the Light of the Morning, when the Sun ri&s;eth, even a Morning without Clouds; as the tender Gra&s;s &s;pringing out of the Earth by clear &s;hining after Rain.</HI> i. e. The religious Ruler will be a great common and exten&s;ive Ble&s;&s;ing, like the Light and Rain of Heaven.</P>
<P>THIS is al&s;o the be&s;t way to <HI>&s;ecure and exalt their own Character.</HI> For, if a &s;erious and &s;trict Regard to Religion runs thro' their Conduct, both in private and publick Life; if they appear to act in the Fear of God, and with a governing View to the Honour of Chri&s;t, this will certainly make them look more great and venerable in the Eyes of the People, than any &s;hining Titles or glitter|ing Badges of Honour which they wear: This will procure them not only outward but <HI>inward</HI> Reverence. When Piety is found in Conjunction with Greatne&s;s, the Per&s;on &s;hines with a diviner Lu&s;tre, and the Authority wherewith he is ve&s;ted &s;trikes into a greater Awe, and more powerfully con&s;trains Submi&s;&s;ion and Obedience. So <HI>Jo&s;hua was magnified in the fight of all</HI> I&s;rael.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jo&s;h. 4. 14.</NOTE></P>
<P>THUS they will be likely to <HI>&s;it ea&s;y in their Po&s;ts of Honour;</HI> not only from the Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their own Integrity, which will always give them inward Peace, and rai&s;e their Minds above the Cen&s;ures and Clamours of ignorant and di&s;affected

Per&s;ons; but al&s;o from the Acceptance which their faithful Endeavours will find among the Generality of their People. For as bad as the World is, <HI>when the Righteous are in Authority,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 29. 2.</NOTE> <HI>the People rejoice.</HI> Common People, and even vici|ous People, are under &s;uch a Conviction of the Ex|cellency of Virtue and Religion, that they can't but take Satisfaction when they &s;ee it <HI>exalted to great Dignity.</HI></P>
<P>MOREOVER,</P>
<P>THIS is the mo&s;t likely way for them to be <HI>e&s;tabli&s;h'd and continued in their Authority,</HI> and to have their publick Opportunities and Advantages lengthned out by that GOD <HI>in who&s;e hand their Times are.</HI> For it &s;tands in the Book of GOD as an Argument why the King &s;hould above all Things mind Religion, <HI>To the end that he may pro|long his Days in his Kingdom.</HI> Deut. 17. 20. Agree|ably (as one ob&s;erves) we find in the Hi&s;tory of the Kings of <HI>Judah,</HI> that generally the be&s;t Reigns were the longe&s;t, except when GOD &s;hortned them for the Puni&s;hment of the People, as <HI>Jo&s;iahs.</HI> Or, this will mini&s;ter plea&s;ing Reflections to them, and give them a Satisfaction <HI>divinely calm,</HI> if they &s;ee Others fill the Stations they have held; or in the near Approach of <HI>Death,</HI> and Pro&s;pect of their <HI>final Account</HI> to GOD the Judge of all. <HI>Be</HI> wi&s;e <HI>now therefore, O ye Kings; be</HI> in&s;tructed <HI>ye Judges of the Earth: Serve the Lord,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="2">2. IF we con&s;ider the <HI>Dignity of this glorious Per&s;on</HI> whom the <HI>Kings</HI> and <HI>Judges of the Earth</HI> are commanded to <HI>&s;erve,</HI> there will appear the

highe&s;t Rea&s;on why they &s;hou'd obey the Com|mand: He is the LORD; the SON.</P>
<P>CHRIST is here &s;poken of both with Re&s;pect to his eternal Deity, and his Office of Mediator. He is the <HI>Son of GOD</HI> by eternal Generation; and he is the <HI>Son of Man,</HI> i. e. God-man, Mediator: And all Men are bound to &s;erve him, not only on Ac|count of his eternal Deity, but his Office as Me|diator. His Supremacy over the World, is a Prerogative annex'd to his being Head of the Church.

He has a Title both by Inheritance and by Appointment. A natural and delegated right. A <HI>natural</HI> one, as he is the true GOD,<NOTE PLACE="marg">John 1. 3.</NOTE> <HI>by whom were all things made that are made;</HI> and a <HI>delegated</HI> one, as he is Mediator: So he is inve&s;ted by the Father, who is the Fountain of Power, with the &s;ole Admini&s;tration of Govern|ment, in the Kingdom of Providence as well as of Grace.

<P>THE Title and Character of <HI>Lord</HI> given to Chri&s;t in the Text, &s;ugge&s;ts to us the&s;e following Rea&s;ons why the <HI>Kings</HI> and <HI>Judges of the Earth,</HI> Rulers of all Degrees, &s;hould <HI>&s;erve</HI> him.</P>

1. HE is the LORD, and &s;o their Authority is <HI>deriv'd from him.</HI> It is &s;o with re&s;pect to the <HI>Con&s;titution of Government</HI> it &s;elf: for Dominion and Rule are his Appointment in the World; the Original of Power is from Heaven, as has been &s;hewn already.&mdash;And it is &s;o with re&s;pect to the <HI>De&s;ignation of the Per&s;ons</HI> cloathed with it. In whatever Way, by whatever Means and Methods, Men are advanc'd to their &s;everal Stations, the Providence of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t is to be ac|knowledg'd and ador'd therein. <HI>For both Riches and Honour come of thee;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Chron. 29. 12.</NOTE> <HI>and in thy band it is to make great, and to give &s;trength unto all.</HI> We many times &s;ee &s;trange and unexpected Turns, and are &s;urpriz'd at the &s;udden Di&s;grace of &s;ome," and Elevation of others: But we &s;hould con&s;ider" that <HI>the mo&s;t high ruleth in the Kingdom of Men,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. 4. 12.</NOTE> <HI>and giveth it to whom&s;oever he will.</HI> Preferments depend not on the Will of the <HI>People</HI> when they chu&s;e, nor on the Will of the <HI>Prince</HI> when he appoints; but on the Will of GOD who has all Hearts in his Hand.

<P>IT was an In&s;tance of the papal Pride and Arro|gance, when the <HI>Pope</HI> after he had crown'd an Emperor kneeling, immediately with his Foot kick'd off his Crown again, as an emblematical Boa&s;t of his Power to make and unmake Kings at his Plea&s;ure.

The Honour and Power of Rulers do not terminate in them&s;elves&punc; as if the De&s;ign of GOD in the In&s;titution of Magi&s;tracy, was only to gra|tify a few particular Men, by rai&s;ing them above the common Rank, and putting them into Au|thority for their Per&s;ons Sake, and only to make <HI>them</HI> look great.

<P N="3">3.

<P>"THE SON can be angry, tho' he be the Saviour. Gracious and conde&s;cending as he is, he can be &s;everely angry. He has Jealou&s;y as well as Love; Wrath as well as Compa&s;&s;ion and Grace. And
<PB N="31" REF="004498_0034_100D5A53562839D8">
if He be angry, who is the Mediator between GOD and Man, what will become of us? who then will interceed for us with a GOD already offended?</P>
<P>"CHRIST is call'd the <HI>Lamb;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev.</NOTE> yet he is <HI>the Lion of the Tribe of</HI> Judah: and <HI>the Wrath of</HI> this <HI>King,</HI> of this King of Kings, <HI>is as the roaring of a Lion,</HI> and eno' to make the &s;toute&s;t Heart to tremble.</P>

<P>THE Kings and Judges of the Earth mu&s;t not think them&s;elves above the Re&s;entment of Chri&s;t, or too big for him to deal with. He will be angry with <HI>them</HI> as &s;oon as with others; and they will be as little able to &s;tand before his Indignation. Whatever Prerogatives they may lay claim to here, they will be of no Service to them in the Day of Death,<NOTE PLACE="marg">I&s;a. 30. 33.</NOTE> and the Day of Judgment. <HI>Tophet is ordain'd of old, for the King it is prepared,</HI> that will not &s;ubmit to this King of Kings, and become his Servant.</P>

<P>WHILE his Wrath burns again&s;t others, his Face will &s;hine upon <HI>the&s;e.</HI> While his Appear|ance &s;trikes others into killing Terrors, it will fill the&s;e with warme&s;t Tran&s;ports of Joy.

<P>THEN the <HI>Kings of the Earth</HI> who religiou&s;ly and dutifully ca&s;t their Crowns at the Feet of Chri&s;t, will have a weighter, brighter, and more

<P>THUS I have di&s;cours'd upon the Text in the &s;everal Divi&s;ions of it; and mu&s;t ha&s;ten to bring Home what has been &s;aid in a di&s;tinct Application to the two Divi&s;ions, of <HI>Rulers</HI> and <HI>Ruled,</HI> which take in this whole A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>AND,</P>
<P N="1">1. OUR <HI>honoured Rulers,</HI> of every Degree and Order in the Government, are taught what their Duty to Chri&s;t is, and what are His ju&s;t Expecta|tions from them. Since he is the &s;upream Lord, and the Fountain of Power: Since the In&s;titution of Government is from Him, and your own De|&s;ignation to your &s;everal Tru&s;ts and Offices is by him: Since you are employ'd in Subordination to him, and with a View to the &s;ame De&s;ign for which he has receiv'd all power in Heaven and Earth: Since you depend upon him, who is <HI>Lord both of

the Dead and Living,</HI> for the Continuance of your Lives and publick Advantages: Since you are accountable to him, and mu&s;t very quickly ren|der up your Account: And &s;ince you will then, according as you acquit your &s;elves now, either fall under his terrible Di&s;plea&s;ure which is wor&s;e than Death, or receive the di&s;tingui&s;hing Marks of his Favour, which is better than Life in all the Ho|nours or Injoyments of it: Since it is thus, I &s;ay, Duty, Gratitude and Intere&s;t con&s;pire, all the Rules of Ju&s;tice, Decency and Honour unite, to oblige you to act in your particular Po&s;ts and Stations, according to his Will, and for his Glory.</P>
<P>BUT it may be this Me&s;&s;age of Heaven may the more awaken your thinking and active Powers, and come with a greater Force and Weight upon you, if it be more particularly applied.</P>
<P>WHEREFORE,</P>
<P N="1">1. In the fir&s;t place, let the Coun&s;el of Hea|ven which has been given, be acceptable to your EXCELLENCY, to whom with a mo&s;t dutiful Re&s;pect it is now addre&s;s'd.</P>
<P>AND it is our great Plea&s;ure and Happine&s;s this Day, that we can addre&s;s <HI>our Governour in Chief,</HI> as one who has openly cho&s;en the LORD to &s;erve him, and that in <HI>the Way of the&s;e Churches.</HI> Suffer me then, SIR, to remind you, That you publickly devoted your &s;elf to the Service of the exalted Son of GOD, when you had ju&s;t entred the World in &s;uperiour outward Circum&s;tances and Advantages; and it was a great Plea&s;ure to your own and your
<PB N="35" REF="004498_0038_100D5A5C55D9DB58">
Fathers Friends, and the Friends of Religion, then to ob&s;erve it; from the Hopes it gave them that Chri&s;t and his People here would afterwards have much Service from you, by the Will of GOD: And doubtle&s;s you look upon your Covenant Obligati|ons to be &s;trengthn'd, by the Honours to which <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> in his Providence has &s;ince advanc'd you.</P>
<P>A <HI>Servant of Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> is a Character which <HI>Kings</HI> and <HI>Governours</HI> have no rea&s;on to be a&s;ham'd of; a Title which they &s;hou'd be ambitious of: For it will be found their true&s;t Honour, when all the Glory of this World &s;hall vani&s;h like a Blaze in Straw; and will turn to their greate&s;t Advant|age, when all the Prerogatives they were po&s;&s;e&s;t of here, will be forgotten and u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>THE Honour of Chri&s;t and his Intere&s;t are very much concern'd in your <HI>Excellency's</HI> Conduct and Admini&s;tration. Religion is not in &s;uch a State at this Day, but it needs the Example of the greate&s;t among&s;t us to render it more reputable and ho|nourable. But while your <HI>Excellency</HI> is &s;een to pay a &s;olemn Regard to the Day of GOD, to at|tend with Reverence and Devotion upon his pub|lick Wor&s;hip, and to live in the Practice of tho&s;e private and publick Vertues which adorn the Chri&s;|tian Character, <HI>this</HI> will go very far to prevent its falling into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">rther Contempt and Neglect.</P>
<P>ESPECIALLY if together with this the Honours of the Government, which are &s;o much at your <HI>Excellency's</HI> Di&s;po&s;al, are conferr'd on true Piety, and not given in Cour&s;e or out of Compliment. I humbly conceive your <HI>Excellency</HI> cannot give a
