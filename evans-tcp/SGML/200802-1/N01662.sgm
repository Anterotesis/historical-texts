<HEAD>A &s;hort and wonderful ACCOUNT OF THE Conver&s;ion of Three <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Chil|dren to Chri&s;tianity. <DATE><HI>BERLIN,</HI> Aug. <HI>the</HI> 10th. 1716.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>_ABOUT three Weeks ago, <HI>three</HI> young <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Girls, who&s;e Names were <HI>Sprintz, Guttel,</HI> and <HI>E&s;ther,</HI> Daugh|ters of <HI>I&s;aac Veits</HI> and <HI>Sophia Mos;es,</HI> Jews, came to the Hou&s;e of Mr. <HI>Kahman</HI> a <HI>Lutheran</HI> Mini&s;ter of St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s Church in <HI>Berlin.</HI> The elde&s;t of 'em was Twelve Years old; (tho' the Mother gives out &s;he is but Nine:) The younge&s;t was Eight, or, as the Mo|ther pretends, but Six.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="001974_0004_0FBA3CF8E7EFE468">The&s;e Children de&s;ir'd to &s;peak with the Mini&s;ter: As &s;oon as he appeared, the elde&s;t addre&s;s'd her &s;elf to him fir&s;t, and &s;aid: She with her two <HI>Si&s;ters were come to request his Protection and Instructi|on; for that they had a great De&s;ire to em|brace the Chri&s;tian Religion, whereby they likewi&s;e might have Part in</HI> Je&s;us <HI>of</HI> Naza|reth, <HI>the true God, who dyed for them, as well as for the rest of Mankind</HI>; adding, <HI>That the &s;incere and unfeigned Love to this crucified God, con&s;trained them hereto; and that they could not po&s;&s;ibly live any longer with their Parents.</HI></P>
<P>Mr&middot; <HI>Kahman,</HI> the Mini&s;ter, was much &s;urprized at what he heard, and began to think they had, perhaps, met with &s;ome &s;evere U&s;age at Home, which occa&s;ioned their &s;peaking to him in this Manner: Wherefore he advis'd them to Return home again, and be hereafter more Obe|dient to their Parents. But all three flung them&s;elves down at his Feet, begging and intreating him, in the Name of <HI>JES&V;S,</HI> whom they loved and adored, to receive them; declaring withal, That nothing in this World had moved them to for&s;ake
<PB N="5" REF="001974_0005_0FBA3CFE40664F68">
their Parents Hou&s;e, but the &s;ole View of becoming <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s cho&s;en Ones, and to belong to Him alone; and that, Let Things go how they would with them, they were fully re&s;olv'd <HI>rather to dye, than to leave their Je&s;us.</HI> Whereupon the Mi|ni&s;ter took them into his Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The Parents having &s;earched up and down for their Children a con&s;iderable Time in vain, came to hear at la&s;t they were at Mr. <HI>Kahman</HI>'s; to whom they went, and demanded their Children of him: He reply'd, he had &s;ent already an Account of the Ca&s;e of the&s;e Children to his Maje&s;ty the King of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia</HI>; and that it did not lie in his Power to deliver up the Children to them again&s;t their own Inclinations: However, he promi&s;ed to &s;ay nothing to the Children&punc; till he re|ceived Orders from his Maje&s;ty concern|ing them.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the King had received the Account, he appointed certain Commi|&s;&s;ioners, two of the <HI>Reformed,</HI> and two of the <HI>Lutheran</HI> Per&s;wa&s;ion, <HI>viz.</HI> the Reve|rend Dr. <HI>Jablonski,</HI> Mr. <HI>Achenbach, Po&s;&s;ard</HI> and <HI>Thering,</HI> with &s;trict Orders, to make
<PB N="6" REF="001974_0006_0FBA3CFFA1056268">
an exact Enquiry into this Matter; and particularly to con&s;ider, whether the&s;e Children might be taken into his Ma|je&s;ty's Protection, in order to be brought up in the Chri&s;tian Religion, again&s;t their Parents Con&s;ent, without infringing the Power that Parents have over their Chil|dren, grounded on divine and humane Right.</P>
<P>Hereupon the Commi&s;&s;ioners ordered the Children to be brought before them, and appointed the Parents, in the mean while, to go into another Room adjoin|ing, where they might hear the whole Examination. Then they took the Chil|dren, and examined them one after ano|ther; who all, as with one Voice decla|red, <HI>They would not return to their Parents again, but would be made Chri&s;tians, and Children of Eternal Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>It appear'd, they could already &s;ay the <HI>Lord's-Prayer</HI> by Heart, as al&s;o &s;everal Texts out of the <HI>New Te&s;tament,</HI> with &s;everal Hymns: The younge&s;t could al&s;o repeat the <HI>Articles</HI> of the <HI>Chri&s;tian Faith</HI>: All which, they &s;aid, they had learnt whil&s;t they were at Play with Chri&s;tian
<PB N="7" REF="001974_0007_0FBA3D012D8B2630">
Children. The&s;e they rehear&s;ed with a wonderful Devotion; mo&s;t &s;olemnly pro|te&s;ting, that they would never live nor die otherwi&s;e than Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>In order to try their Sincerity, the Reverend Per&s;ons entru&s;ted with this Matter, omitted nothing to repre&s;ent the Life of a Chri&s;tian as <HI>&V;nea&s;y</HI> and <HI>Trou|ble&s;ome</HI> as po&s;&s;ibly they could: However, after having done this, and layed before them, on the one Side, how they would be de&s;pi&s;ed and for&s;aken, even among the Chri&s;tians them&s;elves, and be forced to work hard for their Livelihood: They replied, That they would work <HI>till the very Blood &s;purted out from their Nails,</HI> provided they might be made Children of Eternal Salvation; [and that] though they &s;hould not be happy in this World, they hoped to be &s;o in the next. And when it was repre&s;ented to them, on the other Side, how ea&s;ily and comfortably they might live among the <HI>Jews</HI>; and that their Father had made fine Cloaths for them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they reply'd, <HI>They did not value that at all; the Cloaths mu&s;t remain in the World; they would be Children of Salva|tion,
<PB N="8" REF="001974_0008_0FBA3D02AB556240">
and not return to their Parents again.</HI></P>
<P>After this, the Parents were call'd in, and the Children being placed before them, they began to &s;peak to them with abundance of Tenderne&s;s and Compa&s;&s;ion; they fell upon their Necks, ki&s;s'd their very Hands and Feet, and melted away into Tears.</P>
<P>The Children, not a little amazed hereat, declar'd with many Tears, they would become <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> and not return to their Parents. The middlemo&s;t, in particular, as &s;he was very much pre&s;&s;ed by her Mother to go Home with her, an&s;wer'd: <HI>No! But you, Mother, ought rather to become a Chri&s;tian al&s;o.</HI> They &s;ought then to hide them&s;elves behind the Mini&s;ters, who feigned to turn them off, &s;aying:
<Q>They did very ill to for|&s;ake their Parents, who had &s;uch a ten|der Love for them, who would make them many fine Pre&s;ents, and had brought &s;ome along with them: That, on the contrary, they were to expect among <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> nothing but <HI>Cro&s;&s;es</HI> and <HI>Afflictions</HI>; they would hardly get enough to &s;atisfy their Hunger; but,
<PB N="9" REF="001974_0009_0FBA3D041933D010">
in a Word, would be very Mi&s;era|ble.</Q></P>
<P>The Parents being retir'd, and the Children once more earne&s;tly entreated to return Home with them, but to no purpo&s;e; it was at la&s;t propo&s;ed, to them, That provided their Parents would al&s;o turn <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> whether then they would be content to go along with them? To which they, with an uncommon Con|&s;tancy and Satisfaction, immediately an|&s;wer'd: That if their Parents would but become <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> too, they &s;hould be their Parents &s;till, and then they would go back with them, and endure with them any Hard&s;hip or Tribulation; otherwi&s;e they would never return; for that they loved <HI>Je&s;us</HI> above all other Views, and would, with the highe&s;t Joy imaginable, take his Cro&s;s upon them, and follow him; &s;aying, They might if they plea&s;ed, put them into a <HI>Spin-Hou&s;e,</HI> where they would be heartily willing to Labour: To which the younge&s;t further added: If you will give me nothing, let me die of Hunger, or cut off my very Head; for I had rather lo&s;e my Life, than be &s;eparated from my dear|e&s;t
<PB N="10" REF="001974_0010_0FBA3D15CB638ED0">
<HI>Je&s;us,</HI> who dy'd for me; and if you refu&s;e to take me, he is always ready to receive me into his Arms. I will live and die with Him.</P>
<P>'Tis certain, that no Per&s;on pre&s;ent could forbear Weeping at the Firmne&s;s of the&s;e Children, who&s;e Speech was as &s;ound, as it was artle&s;s; particularly Dr. <HI>Jablonski,</HI> who has a deeper Knowledge in the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Religion than mo&s;t others.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, their Parents were permitted to di&s;cour&s;e with 'em alone, which they did for &s;everal Hours together; but the Children expre&s;&s;ing all along the &s;ame Re&s;olution, and pro&s;trating them&s;elves at la&s;t at the Feet of the Commi&s;&s;ioners, they bid farewel to their Parents, that they might remain to <HI>Je&s;us</HI> alone, and &s;aid: <HI>That nothing had brought them thither but the Love of Je&s;us, and no manner of Rea&s;on &s;hould be powerful enough ever to di|vide them from Him,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>An Account of all this has been &s;ent to his <HI>Pru&s;&s;ian</HI> Maje&s;ty, who&s;e An&s;wer is daily expected. In the mean Time, the Commi&s;&s;ioners have propo&s;ed, that the&s;e Children might be in&s;tructed publickly
<PB N="11" REF="001974_0011_0FBA3D1AEAC91060">
in the Church; and when they were thoroughly grounded in the Truth of the Chri&s;tian Religion, that Leave &s;hould be given, not only to their Parents, but to any <HI>Jew</HI> that would come and hear them, to make what Objections they could, which &s;hould be an&s;wered by the Children &s;o in&s;tructed.</P>
<P>The Baptizing of the&s;e Children will be deferr'd till they are more advanced in Age, that none may deny this to be the Work of God; and 'tis hoped, that this Affair, carried on after this Manner, will tend to the Edification of many other <HI>Jews.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Children have &s;uch a tender Love for the very Name of <HI>JES&V;S,</HI> that though they cannot as yet Read, never|thele&s;s, knowing this Word, when they meet with it, they bow down upon it, and ki&s;s it with a thou&s;and Tears: And they will turn over whole Books to find this Name.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> They a&s;&s;ured us, that &s;everal other Children were of the &s;ame Mind with them&s;elves; but their Parents kept them clo&s;e at Home; notwith&s;tanding
<PB N="12" REF="001974_0012_0FBA3D1DA5F2EB88">
they did not doubt but they would find Means to e&s;cape: For the Love of <HI>JES&V;S</HI> knew how to Coun&s;el in all &s;uch Ca&s;es; and tho' the Parents &s;hould watch them never &s;o narrowly, it would in the End &s;ignify nothing at all, which they three knew by their own Experience.</P>

<HEAD>REMARKS.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. AND now, Fir&s;t; How many Pious PARENTS are there, who are <HI>Travailing</HI> for the Souls of their <HI>Children,</HI> to &s;ee a CHRIST formed in them? They cannot &s;ee their <HI>Children walking in the Truth,</HI> but &s;ee them <HI>walking in the Vanity of their Minds</HI>; and the &s;ight holds them in a painful, and inexpre&s;&s;ible Angui&s;h. They long, they long to &s;ee their Children <HI>Live unto God</HI>; and that they may be able to &s;ay, <HI>This Child was Dead, and is Alive again.</HI> My Friends, Hold on Praying, Weeping, Believing. Indeed, nothing le&s;s than an <HI>Almighty

Arm,</HI> can Change and Clean&s;e the <HI>Vici|ous Hearts</HI> of the Ungodly Children. But the Holy SPIRIT, who is the <HI>Arm of the Lord,</HI> is no le&s;s than the Almighty GOD. Oh! Put tho&s;e Ob&s;tinate Hearts into His Glorious and Almighty Hands. He can give an <HI>A&s;toni&s;hing Turn</HI> unto them. There is <HI>nothing too hard</HI> for Him. <HI>O Lord, I know, that thou can&s;t do every thing</HI>! Believers, Behold what was done at <HI>Berlin,</HI> and be animated.</P>
<P N="2">II. But in the next place, How much may our Faith be now Encouraged, in the Expectation of the GREAT THINGS, which the Promi&s;es of our GOD have a&s;&s;ured us, are to be done, for the Con|verting of whole Nations, to <HI>come and Wor&s;hip Him, and Glorify His Name</HI>? And more particularly, for the Conver&s;ion of the <HI>I&s;raeliti&s;h Nation</HI>; when <HI>He that Scat|tered I&s;rael &s;hall Gather him, and Keep him, as a Shepherd his Flock?</HI> There are many Good and Wi&s;e Men, who are Looking for the <HI>Kingdom of God,</HI> and tho&s;e Influ|ences from Heaven upon Earth, which will bring the Maxims of the EVER|LASTING GOSPEL into a General, and
<PB N="14" REF="001974_0014_0FBA3D2C987CFF48">
an Amazing Operation upon a <HI>World</HI> that is now <HI>lying in Wickedne&s;s.</HI> The Intention of &s;uch Things as have been done at <HI>Ber|lin</HI> (and el&s;ewhere) is doubtle&s;s to let the Faithful &s;ee, a <HI>few Drops,</HI> that may Com|fort their Hopes of the <HI>Mighty Showers,</HI> which GOD in His own Time, [when the <HI>Three Years and Six Months</HI> are Expi|red!] will cau&s;e to fall upon the Chil|dren of Men, and He comes <HI>to dwell with Men.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. The Words of the Excellent Per|&s;on, who Writes the Preface to this Re|markable at <HI>Berlin,</HI> are well worthy to be tran&s;cribed.</P>
<Q><P>The various Motions ob&s;erved in &s;e|veral parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> tending to a Re|vival of <HI>Sound and Sub&s;tantial Piety,</HI> do pre&s;age the Approach of Better Times, and a fuller Mea&s;ure of the Divine Spi|rit promi&s;ed to the Latter Days. But then the Intervening Night of the Judg|ment of GOD, provoked by a long and continued Cour&s;e of Sinning, will per|haps de&s;troy again the Flowers, which appear up and down on the Earth, and
<PB N="15" REF="001974_0015_0FBA3D2EC83374F0">
nip many a Tender Bud, which now begins to &s;hoot forth. This ought, in no wi&s;e to Stagger the Faith of True Believers, but rather to Quicken it.</P>
<P>What Sweet and Heavenly Motions there have been particularly &s;een among many Children, in the&s;e Latter Years, doth appear from the &s;eveaal Treati&s;es publi&s;hed on that Account.&mdash; Particu|larly, whole Numbers of Children in <HI>Sile&s;ia.</HI>&mdash; All the&s;e Motions are but &s;o many <HI>Glimp&s;es,</HI> that Glance indeed at a Larger Power of Spiritual Gifts and Graces. But then, they wear off again, after a while, and leave an Indu&s;trious Ob&s;erver of &s;uch <HI>Signs,</HI> in a Pious Ex|pectation of tho&s;e Richer Incomes of Grace, which &s;hall &s;ucceed? They are the <HI>Fir&s;t-Fruits</HI> of the Spirit, and an <HI>Earne&s;t</HI> of a more Glorious Di&s;pen&s;ation which &s;hall follow in the Fulne&s;s of Time. They ought therefore to Sup|port the Hopes of tho&s;e that wait for the Manife&s;tation of the Kingdom of CHRIST.</P></Q>
<P N="4"><PB N="16" REF="001974_0016_0FBA3D32C4D4B5A8">IV.

<P>If but one Soul of all that <HI>Beloved Peo|ple,</HI> &s;hould be found, and reach'd, and touch'd, by the Things to be now laid before them, it will be well worth all the Pains of the&s;e Expo&s;tulations.
