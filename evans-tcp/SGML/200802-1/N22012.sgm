<P>THERE are few &s;ituations more inte|re&s;ting to the human race, than that which the people of America this day pre|&s;ents. The temples of the living God are every where, throughout this ri&s;ing empire, this day, crowded, I tru&s;t, with wor&s;hip|pers, who&s;e hearts, impre&s;&s;ed with a ju&s;t and lively &s;en&s;e of the great things, which he hath done for them, pour forth, in uni|&s;on, the grateful tribute of prai&s;e and thank&s;|giving. Yes, this day, brethren, the voice of rejoicing and &s;alvation is in the tabernacles of the righteous; and with rea&s;on, for the hi&s;tory of nations doth not exhibit a people who ever had more cau&s;e to offer up to the great author of every good the mo&s;t fervent expre&s;&s;ions of gratitude and thanks-giving. Let, my brethren, the &s;ons of irreligion, wrapped in their dark and gloomy &s;y&s;tem of fatality, refu&s;e to open their eyes to the great luminous proofs of providential government, which America di&s;plays; let them turn from a light, which their weak vi&s;ion cannot bear; but let the

righteous, let tho&s;e who tru&s;t in God, who can trace in that good and glorious being, the relations of father, friend and governor, let them, with eagle eyes look up to that full blaze of &s;alvation, which he hath vouch|&s;afed to this new world. Permit me then, upon this occa&s;ion, to turn your attention to tho&s;e great things, which the Lord hath done for us, to tho&s;e manifold di&s;plays of divine providence, which the hi&s;tory of America exhibits; and let the &s;ubject afford an opportunity to revive within us &s;enti|ments of lively gratitude, and excite &s;incere re&s;olutions to fear the Lord, and to &s;erve him; in a word, to increa&s;e daily in piety, and in all tho&s;e noble affections of the &s;oul which dignify the chri&s;tian and the patriot.</P>
<P>I. Who can tell how many ages had been &s;wallowed up in the all-ab&s;orbing gulph of time, before the bold navigator fir&s;t e&s;&s;ayed to vi&s;it the&s;e di&s;tant regions of the earth? Who can tell how long this we&s;tern world had been the habitation of the li&s;tle&s;s Sa|vage, or the wild bea&s;ts of the fore&s;t? At the&s;e que&s;tions Chronology drops her epochs, as incapable of conducting her to periods &s;o remote, and which have e&s;caped her gra&s;p. The ways of Heaven mu&s;t oft appear to us, weak mortals, dark and intricate. But the fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;tion, which here pre&s;ents it&s;elf, is, that providence &s;eems to have thrown a veil over this portion of the globe, in order to conceal it from the eyes of the nations of the ca&s;t, until the de&s;tined period

had arrived for the regeneration of mankind, in this new world, after tho&s;e various other means, which the wi&s;dom of the Almighty had permitted to operate, in the old, had proved ineffectual&punc; In vain had rea&s;on, the hand-maid of pure religion, long attempt|ed to convince men of the reciprocal duties, which equality and fraternity impo&s;e. Still there would ari&s;e &s;ome one,
<Q><L>of proud ambitious heart, who, not content</L>
<L>with fair equality, fraternal &s;tate,</L>

In vain had even thy di&s;pen&s;ation of love and peace, ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us! long e&s;&s;ayed to di&s;arm ambition of the en&s;anguined &s;word, and to diffu&s;e benevolence, equality and fraternity among the human race. Millions &s;till groaned under the heavy pre&s;&s;ure, which tyranny impo&s;ed. Yes, even thy go&s;pel of love, of univer&s;al fraternity, had been, too often, perverted into the mo&s;t formidable &s;y&s;tem of oppre&s;&s;ion; and mankind, in&s;tead of &s;ee|ing it diffu&s;e the heavenly rays of philan|thropy, too frequently beheld it as impo&s;ing a yoke, to degrade and en&s;lave them. The princes of the earth &s;ought not for the &s;a|cred duties, which it enjoined; but they &s;ought to render it the &s;anction of their exterminating vengeance, or their deep laid &s;y&s;tems of u&s;urpation. Is not the hi&s;tory

of almo&s;t all Europe pregnant with proofs of this calamitous truth? If you can point to &s;ome &s;mall portion, where the religion of the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us, untrammeled with political u&s;urpations, was left to operate its happy effects upon the pa&s;&s;ions and the con|duct of men; or where toleration extended wide her arms of mercy to embrace the whole family of Chri&s;t, the &s;pot appears like a &s;olitary &s;tar, which in the mid&s;t of night, beams forth alone, whil&s;t clouds and thick darkne&s;s ob&s;cure the re&s;t of the innumerable ho&s;t of Heaven. Alas! what avails the voice of rea&s;on or religion, when the lu&s;t of domination has u&s;urped the &s;oul! At the &s;hrine of this fell demon, the human race was &s;acrificed by thou&s;ands Nay, too many of the &s;ons of Europe are &s;till bound with cords to the altars of am|bition, and there immolated, not only by thou&s;ands, but by tens of thou&s;ands Do you doubt the a&s;&s;ertion, afflictive as it &s;eems to our brethren of the old world? The la&s;t four years have, in their flight, &s;carcely wanted a moment to te&s;tify the melancholy truth.&mdash;I will not add the long catalogue of tho&s;e innumerable &s;courges, which, from time to time, have vi&s;ited Europe; I will not &s;peak of tho&s;e various tempe&s;ts, which, by divine command, have &s;o often &s;haken the guilty nations of the ea&s;t, but which &s;eem in vain to have ut|tered the voice of warning and reproof: Domination &s;till rivetted her iron chains:

the fangs of governments, avaricious, ar|bitrary and vindictive, entered even into the &s;ouls of the &s;uffering people. The heritage of the Lord were only as &s;heep de&s;tined to be &s;horn or &s;laughtered, whil&s;t the unfeel|ing de&s;pot exacted in return, not ob&s;equious obedience only, but even profe&s;&s;ions of gra|titude for the innumerable ble&s;&s;ings, which flowed from his hallowed protection.&mdash;How were the&s;e chains to be bur&s;t a&s;under? How was the human race to be re&s;tored to their inherent rights, rights, which the God of nature con&s;ecrated at the birth of every in|dividual? How was the dignity of man to be vindicated? How were tho&s;e &s;enti|ments of equality, benevolence and frater|nity, which rea&s;on, and religion, and na|ture enjoin, to rea&s;&s;ume their &s;overeignty over the human &s;oul, and to da&s;h again&s;t the heads of u&s;urpers the chains, the bur|thens, the oppre&s;&s;ions, which had &s;o long brought down the grey hairs of the multi|tude with &s;orrow to the grave? How could the principles of a revolution &s;o important, &s;o e&s;&s;ential for the happine&s;s of the human &s;pecies, be generated, but by rai&s;ing up, as it were, a new race of men, in &s;ome re|mote, &s;ome ble&s;&s;ed clime, where, from their infancy, unfettered by tho&s;e errors, which time appears to &s;anctify, they &s;hould be trained not only to a knowledge, but to a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of the duty of a&s;&s;erting and maintaining their rights; and above all, where the love of equality, the ba&s;is of all

rights and all &s;ocial happine&s;s, &s;hould be congenial to man? This favoured region, favoured indeed of Heaven, is America. It is here, a knowledge of tho&s;e political truths, which the immortal Sydneys and the Lockes of former years inve&s;tigated with philo&s;ophic eye, bur&s;ts &s;pontaneous forth. It is here, that men, led by the hand of nature, their minds unawed and unob&s;cured by opinions and cu&s;toms as barbarous and unfriendly to &s;ocial rights as the dark chaotic ages, which gave them birth, &s;ee and acknowledge as axioms, what philo&s;ophers have toiled to e&s;tabli&s;h by deductions, long and intricate. It is in America, that the germs of the uni|ver&s;al redemption of the human race from domination and oppre&s;&s;ion have already be|gun to be developed; it is in America, that we &s;ee a redintegration of divine love for man, and that the voice of Heaven it&s;elf &s;eems to call to her &s;ons, go ye forth and di&s;ciple all nations, and &s;pread among them the go&s;pel of equality and fraternity.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Terms have their days of fa&s;hion, like many other things.

The view, &s;ays the writer, exhibited in this e&s;&s;ay, &s;o far from loo&s;ening the bands of &s;ociety, or weakening that &s;ubordination, without which no government can &s;ub&s;i&s;t, will draw more clo&s;ely every &s;ocial tie, and more &s;trongly confirm the obligations of legal obedience, and the rights of legal authority. Certainly this principle is one of the hinges upon which the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem turns.</HI></NOTE></P>

II. The&s;e con&s;iderations pre&s;ent to our minds the fir&s;t traces of the beneficent de|&s;igns of providence in the hi&s;tory of this new world. Nor ought it, in the 2d place, to be here forgotten, that the cur|rent, or general tendency of providence is al&s;o to be traced back to the &s;ource, whence the pre&s;ent free and enlightened race of Ame|rica &s;prung. For &s;urely, our fore-fathers, amid&s;t the wreck of human rights, and the convul&s;ive tempe&s;ts with which ambition had &s;o often overwhelmed the nations of the ea&s;t, &s;till evinced, at times, no &s;mall por|tion of that etherial &s;pirit, that ardent love of liberty, which glows in the American brea&s;t. It was this indomitable &s;pirit, this attachment to the inherent rights of man, &s;tronger infinitely than the fear of tho&s;e &s;torms, which agitate the immen&s;e atlan|tic, or of the fierce and cruel tenants of the howling wilderne&s;s, or the ravages of di&s;|ea&s;e, and famine and death it&s;elf, which urged our fore-fathers to the&s;e di&s;tant &s;hores. Yes, brethren, it was this noble principle, this love of liberty, which defying all dan|gers, conducted our fore-fathers to Ame|rica; but who doth not &s;ee, that this prin|ciple, whil&s;t it only could prompt to the bold enterprize, was no where to be found &s;o pure, &s;o energetic as in Britain? Who doth not &s;ee, that thus to have tran&s;ported it to America, thus to have incorporated it with the primary &s;ocial in&s;titutions of this country, may be ju&s;tly deemed an event
<PB N="10" REF="029016_0010_0FDE95DDF5B38730">
mo&s;t fortunate for mankind, nay, mo&s;t worthy of providence it&s;elf? Had this prin|ciple been equally tran&s;ported to the fertile plains of Mexico, or Peru, in&s;tead of the <HI>Auri &s;acra fames,</HI> they al&s;o would have had their Apo&s;tles, nay, their martyrs to liber|ty. Yes, even Maxico, and Peru, e're this di&s;tant period, would have had their Wa&s;h|ington, would have unfurled the banners of liberty, and would have fought, and bled, and conquered. If then we dare attempt with mortal eye to trace tho&s;e cau&s;es, by which the Almighty operates, it will not be thought pre&s;umptuous, I tru&s;t, not only to a&s;cribe to his directive wi&s;dom the introduction of a principle, which here fo&s;tered, will re|deem the captive nations of the earth; but al&s;o, the introduction of it, at a time, when its active, but daily increa&s;ing energy &s;hould accelerate the great and glorious revolution, which it has already effected in America, which it has commenced in Europe, and which will not be arre&s;ted in its progre&s;s, until the complete re&s;toration of the human race to their inherent rights be accompli&s;h|ed, throughout the globe. Let the tyrants of the earth &s;et them&s;elves in array again&s;t this principle; 'they &s;hall be cha&s;ed as the chaff of the mountain before the wind, and like the down of the thi&s;tle before the whirlwind.'&mdash;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>I&s;aiah.</HI></NOTE></P>

they are to the friends of piety, of rea&s;on and of liberty, give way to others, excited by more obvious di&s;pen&s;ations of providence. Suppo&s;e, my brethren, when our forefa|thers here fir&s;t re&s;ted the &s;oles of their feet, delivered from tho&s;e waters, which &s;eemed almo&s;t to cover the face of the whole earth, the guardian angel of America withdraw|ing the curtain of time, had opened to their view the pro&s;pect, which this day pre&s;ents; had &s;hewn to them, America, free, inde|pendent, and holding an eminent rank among the nations of the earth; had &s;hewn to them her &s;ons and her daughters, nume|rous as the &s;tars of Heaven, a&s;&s;embled in the hou&s;es of their God, and with one voice, offering up the grateful incen&s;e of adoration, prai&s;e and thanks-giving, for the great things that he hath done for them; had &s;hewn to them the fir&s;t in&s;tance, which the world has ever exhibited of written &s;ocial compacts, together with her plans of government, founded on the eternal ba&s;is of wi&s;dom, equality and ju&s;tice; had &s;hewn to them, the thou&s;and ble&s;&s;ings, which peace, from her horn of plenty, &s;catters round, with the arts and &s;ciences gradually advancing in her train; had &s;hewn to them, her navies, loaded not with the de&s;olating weapons of war, but with the fruits of the earth, vexing with their prows the mo&s;t di&s;tant &s;eas; had &s;hewn to them the bright portrait of that heroic citizen, who&s;e pru|dence, who&s;e fortitude, and who&s;e wi&s;dom

&s;hine equally refulgent in war as in peace; and la&s;tly, had &s;hewn to them, the faire&s;t portion of the old world, by the example of America, by the influence of that ener|getic principle, which &s;he had nurtured and matured, awaking as from a dream, putting on &s;trength as in the antient days, in the generations of old, uprooting the deep founded &s;y&s;tems of u&s;urpation, and ga|thering the oppre&s;&s;ed under the wings of liberty and fraternity: And whil&s;t he pre|&s;ented the glorious, the animating pro&s;pect, &s;hould &s;ay to them, all the&s;e events, my &s;ons, great and a&s;toni&s;hing as they are, &s;hall come to pa&s;s within the &s;hort period, of a patriarchal life; would they not have fallen down upon their faces, and wor&s;hip+ping the God of their fathers, exclaimed. This is the Lords doing, and it is marvel|lous in our eyes? We, brethren, fortu|nate as we are, have lived to &s;ee this tri|umphal day. And is there a &s;oul here pre|&s;ent, is there one throughout this ri&s;ing empire, who doth not trace, in the eventful hi&s;tory of America, the con&s;picuous di&s;plays of the hand of providence? Is there one, who is not ready al&s;o to exclaim, it is the Lords doing?

accoutred as he was, with a &s;word, and with a &s;pear, and with a Shield, which al&s;o delivered thee, from the hands of the mightie&s;t of nations.</P>
<P>Do the&s;e our conclu&s;ions appear to &s;ome to favour of pre&s;umptive arrogance, or do we di&s;cover to the philo&s;ophic mind an en|thu&s;ia&s;tic imbecility in a&s;cribing the&s;e events, &s;o peculiar to the annals of America, to the particular direction of providence? Let &s;uch bethink them&s;elves, if &s;uch there be, that it is a ju&s;t reliance upon the &s;uperintending providence of God, a reliance dictated by the concurrent voice of rea&s;on, of philo&s;o|phy and religion, which compels the hum|ble, the grateful and the wi&s;e to con&s;ider all tho&s;e di&s;po&s;itions or events, which &s;o remarkably coincide with the general plan of the moral government of the world, as indications of the de&s;ign and direction of omnipotence. Cau&s;es and effects are, doubt|le&s;s, in the hands of him who willed their connexion. But his will is the general happine&s;s. They who indulge this idea, &s;o con&s;olatory to man, will therefore con&s;ider it as the homage which is due to the crea|tor, regenerator and pre&s;erver of the uni|ver&s;e, to a&s;cribe to his &s;uperior direction, effects &s;o concordant with his goodne&s;s, and which &s;o greatly tran&s;cend all human means. Yes, brethren, if the effects, which we have, in your hearing, thus &s;lightly traced; if the period of time when America was di&s;covered, the nece&s;&s;ity and the con&s;equent

<P>IV. But, my brethren, to re&s;t contented with merely viewing the hand of providence, or in acknowledging the plan of divine wi&s;|dom, which is here operating for the gene|ral felicity, would be to halt at the thre&s;h|hold of the temple of God. Gratitude, warm and fervent, united to a &s;incere re&s;o|lution 'to fear and to &s;erve him,' is the return, which the Almighty beneficence claims from every wor&s;hipper. It is the fir&s;t &s;acrifice of a heart capable of being touched by acts of unbounded love, by deeds of mercy and kindne&s;s &s;o eminently extended not to us only, but, through our agency, to the whole human race. I confe&s;s to you, brethren, who dete&s;t ingratitude even to man, as the &s;ure but melancholy &s;ymptom of a heart, dark, gloomy, and void of every virtuous &s;en&s;ibility, when I recall to mind the pa&s;t, contemplate the pre&s;ent, and pur|&s;uing the confederacy of cau&s;es, look for|ward to tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings of peace, of order, of ju&s;tice and of liberty, which are daily advancing with an accelerated progre&s;s, my &s;oul becomes &s;ublimed with the grand idea of the undeviating love of God to man; I tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e in the moral, as well as in the phy&s;i|cal

world, the evident ve&s;tiges of a Provi|dence, all wi&s;e, all merciful, and all gra|cious: my hopes, temporal as well as eter|nal, in&s;tead of fluctuating in the uncertain ocean of tho&s;e degrading &s;entiments, which overwhelm the &s;oul with fear and de&s;pon|dency, are anchored even at the foot&s;tool of the throne of God. Yes, brethren, &s;truck with the awful image of a goodne&s;s &s;o generous and &s;o extended, my heart over|flows with gratitude, I form new re&s;oluti|ons to fear and to &s;erve him, I exclaim with the P&s;almi&s;t&mdash;'Let the people prai&s;e thee, O God; let all the people prai&s;e thee. O let the nations be glad and &s;ing for joy; for thou &s;halt judge the people righteou&s;ly, and govern the nations upon earth.'</P>
<P>But, brethren, important con&s;iderations &s;till demand our attention. Has Heaven been thus propitious; are we po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings which flow from govern|ments founded in wi&s;dom, ju&s;tice and equa|lity; doth the morning of America break forth refulgent with unclouded glory? Then it behoves us, above all things, to inquire, how are the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings to be pre&s;erved? how &s;hall we en&s;ure to her a meridian &s;plen|dor, worthy of &s;uch a morning?&mdash;This inquiry immediately re&s;olves it&s;elf into ano|ther. What is there in this &s;ublunary &s;tate, that can attract the &s;miles of Hea|ven, or en&s;ure political happine&s;s, but vir|tue? Never was there a mortal &s;o deprav|ed, never was there a con&s;cience &s;o deaf to
<PB N="18" REF="029016_0018_0FDE95F5A73AF030">
that internal voice, which always whi&s;pers truth, but mu&s;t acknowledge, that virtue only gives a title to hope for the favour of that high and lofty one, who inhabiteth eternity. Fellow-citizens, let virtue then, I entreat you, be the ruling principle, the polar &s;tar, which &s;hould influence every &s;entiment, and guide every action, &s;ince it alone will conduct us into the Haven of felicity.&mdash;But will you tru&s;t, for the diffu|&s;ion of virtue, to that political morality, which a vain philo&s;ophy would &s;ub&s;titute in the room of tho&s;e le&s;&s;ons, which the heavenly teacher delivered? Shall virtue trickle from the oozy bed of political ca|techi&s;ms, or &s;hall it gu&s;h, pure and in full &s;tream, from the rock of our &s;alvation? Ah! brethren, the moment that we drop the idea of a God, the remunerator of vir|tue, but the avenger of iniquity; the mo|ment we abandon that divine &s;y&s;tem of equa|lity, fraternity, and univer&s;al benevolence, which the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us taught and exem|plified; the moment that religion, the pure and undefiled religion, which Heaven, in compa&s;&s;ion to the infirmity of human rea|&s;on, vouch&s;afed to mortals, lo&s;es its influ|ence over their hearts, from that fatal mo|ment, farewell to public and private happi|ne&s;s, farewell, a long farewell to virtue, to patrioti&s;m, to liberty! Virtue, &s;uch as republics and Heaven require, mu&s;t have its foundation in the heart; it mu&s;t pene|trate the whole man; it mu&s;t derive its ob|ligations
<PB N="19" REF="029016_0019_0FDE95F8B4DE7068">
and its <HI>Sanctions,</HI> not from the changeable ideas of the political morali&s;t, or the caprice of the wi&s;e&s;t of human le|gi&s;lators, but from the unchangeable father of the univer&s;e, the God of love, who&s;e laws, and who&s;e will we are incited to obey by motives, the mo&s;t powerful that can actuate the human &s;oul. Men mu&s;t &s;ee and feel, that it is God him&s;elf, their maker and their judge, who demands obedience to duties, which con&s;titute their individual, their &s;ocial, their eternal happine&s;s. Then, and not till then, will virtue reign tri|umphant in the hearts of citizens; then will &s;he have her &s;acrifices in the mid&s;t of the deepe&s;t ob&s;curity, as well as in the open day, in the mo&s;t private and &s;ecret retire|ments, as well as upon the hou&s;e tops.</P>
<P>There is, we will grant, a &s;ublime phi|lo&s;ophy, which may form her &s;ages, and even her virtuous and heroic &s;ages. But, will her ab&s;tract doctrines concerning mo|ral obligation, &s;tript of tho&s;e awful <HI>&s;ancti|ons,</HI> which religion annexes, touch the hearts of an entire nation, the poor, the &s;imple, the unlettered, as well as the learn|ed and the wi&s;e? No, brethren, the&s;e &s;a|ges of philo&s;ophy will appear, once perhaps, in a century; her le&s;&s;ons of wi&s;dom, ad|mitting them to po&s;&s;e&s;s the efficacy con|tended for, can be extended but to a few; whil&s;t religion diffu&s;es her &s;oul-&s;aving lea|ven thro' the whole political ma&s;s. It is not for the learned and wi&s;e only, that &s;he

re&s;erves the knowledge of her heavenly pre|cepts; they are addre&s;&s;ed to the whole fa|mily of mankind; the whole univer&s;e is her &s;chool. She has, moreover, this di&s;tin|gui&s;hing advantage; &s;he lays her divine hands upon the infant, and whil&s;t &s;he em|braces him with the arms of mercy, &s;tamps upon his tender, &s;u&s;ceptible mind, the in|delible, but ju&s;t and awful idea of a God, the judge as well as the creator of the uni|ver&s;e, a God, who&s;e all-&s;eeing eye delights only in virtue, a God, who has promi&s;ed thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t, a glorious and ever ble&s;&s;ed immortality as the reward of well-doing, whil&s;t the torturing hour of &s;hame, remor&s;e and mi&s;ery is &s;hewn to await the impious and the wicked. Thus taught by religion, man becomes acquainted with his real character; in&s;tead of being amenable only to human laws, who&s;e utmo&s;t vigilance he may and often does elude, he &s;ees him|&s;elf accountable to a being, as ju&s;t as mer|ciful, as omnipotent as omni&s;cient. He finds him&s;elf de&s;tined, not to the narrow range of the bea&s;ts that peri&s;h, but to im|mortal life. The bright pro&s;pect invigorates his &s;oul; &s;entiments of con&s;cious dignity elevate him above what is low or mean; his views are fixed upon what is truly great and good, patriotic and brave; no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ears appal him, but confident in his God, he evinces him&s;elf, whether in adver&s;ity or pro&s;perity, the inflexible friend of ju&s;tice and humanity.</P>

<P>Fellow-citizens, it is an ea&s;y ta&s;k for tho&s;e who may have the honour of addre&s;|&s;ing an American audience this day, to point out the excellencies of our civil go|vernments, to &s;hew their &s;uperior aptitude for the promotion of political happine&s;s, to evince that obedience to laws, con&s;titutio|nally enacted, is the only means of pre&s;erv|ing liberty, and that every expre&s;&s;ion of the public will is obligatory upon every citizen; to prove, that repre&s;entative republics, in|&s;tead of being the prolific parents of anar|chy and confu&s;ion, are, on the contrary, of all the forms of government, under which men have yet a&s;&s;ociated, either thro' com|pul&s;ion or choice, the mo&s;t promotive of private and public happine&s;s, the mo&s;t &s;u&s;|ceptible of that energy, which is equally capable of curbing the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the

multitude, or of fru&s;trating the wicked de|&s;igns of the ambitious; it is ea&s;y for them to &s;hew, that virtue is the vital principle of a republic, that unle&s;s a magnanimous &s;pirit of patrioti&s;m animates every brea&s;t, unle&s;s a &s;incere and ardent love for ju&s;tice, for temperance, for prudence, for fortitude, in &s;hort, for all tho&s;e qualities, which dig|nify human nature, pervades, enlivens, invigorates the whole ma&s;s of citizens, the&s;e fair &s;uper&s;tructures of political wi&s;dom mu&s;t &s;oon crumble into du&s;t.
