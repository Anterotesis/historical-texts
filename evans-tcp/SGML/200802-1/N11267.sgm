<P>FREE agency, or a rational exi&s;tence, with its powers and faculties, and freedom of enjoying and exerci&s;ing them, is the gift of God to man. The right of the do|nor, and the authenticity of the donation, are both in|conte&s;table; hence man hath an ab&s;olute property in, and right of dominion over him&s;elf, his powers and fa|culties; with &s;elf-love to &s;timulate, and rea&s;on to guide him, in the free u&s;e and exerci&s;e of them, independent of, and uncontrolable by any but him, who created and gave them. And whatever is acquired by the u&s;e, and application of a man's faculties, is equally the proper|ty of that man, as the faculties by which the acqui&s;i|tions are made; and that which is ab&s;olutely the pro|perty of a man, he cannot be dive&s;ted of, but by his own voluntary act, or con&s;ent, either expre&s;&s;ed, or implied.

<P>WHEN our ance&s;tors left the kingdom of England, they were &s;ubjects of that kingdom, and entitled to equal privileges with the re&s;t of its &s;ubjects; when they came into America, where no civil con&s;titutions were exi&s;ting, they joined them&s;elves to none: the lands which they entered and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, they acquired by purcha&s;e, or by conque&s;t of the natives:
<PB N="7" REF="014253_0006_0F935939167A97C8">
they came over of them&s;elves, viz. were not colonies &s;ent out, to make &s;ettlements by government; not to mention the intolerable oppre&s;&s;ions, by which they were driven out, cro&s;&s;ed the Atlantick, and availed them&s;elves of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, at their own ri&s;que and ex|pence, and by their own &s;word and prowe&s;s. Now, in America, they were &s;till &s;ubjects of the kingdom of England, or they were not; if the former, then they were entitled to enjoy, in America, the &s;ame or equal privileges, with tho&s;e enjoyed by the &s;ubjects re&s;iding in England&mdash;if the latter, then that kingdom had no right of juri&s;diction over them, and they were in a &s;tate of nature, at liberty to erect &s;uch a con&s;ti|tution of civil government as they &s;hould chu&s;e. Upon the &s;uppo&s;ition that they were &s;till &s;ubjects of that kingdom, let us con&s;ider what rights and pri|vileges they were entitled to enjoy:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1&s;t. IN regard to legi&s;lation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2d. TAXATION. And,</ITEM>
<ITEM>3d. THE mode of trial.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>BY nature, every man (under God) is his own le|gi&s;lator, judge, and avenger, and ab&s;olute lord of his property. In civil government, rightly con&s;tituted, every one retains a &s;hare in the legi&s;lative, taxative, judicial, and the vindictive powers, by having a voice in the &s;upreme legi&s;lature, which enacts the laws, and impo&s;es the taxes, and by having a right, in all ca&s;es wherein he is injured, to re&s;ort to, and demand redre&s;s, in a cour&s;e of law, from the tribunal of the public, and the &s;word of &s;tate. And the Engli&s;h nation, ear|ly impre&s;&s;ed, with the&s;e fir&s;t great principles of na|tures dictates, erected a &s;y&s;tem of civil government, corre&s;pondent thereto; inve&s;ted the parliament, which con&s;i&s;ted of all the e&s;tates, that compo&s;ed the
<PB N="8" REF="014253_0007_0F935939F1469408">
nation, in epitome, with the &s;upreme &s;overeignty of the kingdom; and in which, each e&s;tate made a part, and had a &s;hare, either per&s;onally or by actual repre|&s;entation, to advi&s;e, re&s;olve, con&s;ent, or di&s;&s;ent, and in which, the concurrence of all three, viz. the King, Lords and Commons, was nece&s;&s;ary, to every act of legi&s;lation. Thus the Engli&s;h government was con|&s;tituted upon the foundation of rea&s;on; and the na|tural rights of the &s;ubjects, in&s;tead of being given up, or impaired, were confirmed, improved and &s;trength|ened, although the mode of exerci&s;ing them was altered: Wherefore it is a maxim in the Engli&s;h laws, that to an act of parliament, every man, in judgment of law is party. The Engli&s;h con&s;titution, like o|ther imitations of nature, was a &s;y&s;tem of con&s;ummate wi&s;dom, and policy, the balance of power, being &s;o judiciou&s;ly placed, as to connect the force, and to pre&s;erve the rights of all; each e&s;tate, armed with a power of &s;elf defence, again&s;t the encroachments of the other two, by being enabled to put a negative up|on any or all of their re&s;olves, neither the King, Lords or Commons, could be deprived of their rights or properties but by their own con&s;ent in parliament, and no laws could be made, or taxes impo&s;ed, but &s;uch as were nece&s;&s;ary, and in the judgment of the three e&s;tates in parliament, for the common good, and intere&s;t of the realm. Mo&s;t ju&s;tly then did a celebrated French writer, treating of the Engli&s;h, and the excellence of their con&s;titution, &s;ay, that England could never lo&s;e its freedom, until parliament lo&s;t its virtue. The Engli&s;h, animated with the &s;pirit of freedom, to their immortal honor, anciently claimed the&s;e privileges, as their unalienable rights, and anxious to pre&s;erve and
<PB N="9" REF="014253_0008_0F93593A945667D8">
tran&s;mit them unimpaired to po&s;terity; cau&s;ed them to be reduced to writing, and in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner to be recognized, ratified and confirmed, fir&s;t by King John, then by his &s;on Henry the IIId. in the 3d and 37th years of his reign, at We&s;tmin&s;|ter-Hall, where Magna Charta was read in the pre|&s;ence of the Nobility and Bi&s;hops, with lighted can|dles in their hands; the King, all the while laying his hand on his brea&s;t, at la&s;t, &s;olemnly &s;wearing faithfully and inviolably to ob&s;erve all things therein contained, as he was a man, a chri&s;tian, a &s;oldier and a King; then the Bi&s;hops extingui&s;hed the can|dles and threw them on the ground, and every one &s;aid, thus let him be extingui&s;hed and &s;tink in hell, who violates this charter: Upon which there was u|niver&s;al fe&s;tivity and joy, ringing of bells, &amp;c. and again by Edward the 1&s;t. in the 25th year of his reign, by the &s;tatute called <HI>Confirmatio Cartarum.</HI> Af|terwards by a multitude of corroborating acts, reck|oned in all, by Lord Cook, to be thirty-two, from Edw. 1&s;t. to Hen. 4th. and &s;ince, in a great variety of in&s;tances, by the bills of right and acts of &s;ettle|ment; whereby Magna Charta, that great charter of liberties, hath been e&s;tabli&s;hed as the &s;tandard of right throughout the realm, and all judgments con|trary thereto declared void, it was ordered to be read twice a year in all the cathedral churches, and &s;en|tence of excommunication to be denounced again&s;t all, who by word or deed, acted contrary to, or in|fringed it.</P>
<P>2d. WITH REGARD TO TAXATION.</P>
<P>As the rights of private property are &s;acred, and no one can be dive&s;ted thereof without his free con|&s;ent: The Engli&s;h con&s;titution, in this al&s;o religi|ou&s;ly
<PB N="10" REF="014253_0009_0F93593B559FB4A0">
follows the dictates of rea&s;on: No &s;ubject of England can be con&s;trained to pay any aids or taxes, even for the defence of the realm, or the &s;upport of government, but &s;uch as are impo&s;ed by his own con|&s;ent, or that of his repre&s;entative in parliament. By the &s;tat. 25 Edw. 1&s;t. c. 5 and 6, it is provided, that the King &s;hall not take any aids or taxes, but by the common a&s;&s;ent of the realm: And what that com|mon a&s;&s;ent is, is more fully explained, by the 34th of Edw. 1&s;t. &s;tat. 4, c. 1, which enacts, that no talliage or aid &s;hall be taken, without a&s;&s;ent of Archbi&s;hops, Bi&s;hops, Earls, Barons, Knights, Burge&s;&s;es, and other freemen of the land; and by the 14th Edw. 3. &s;tat. 2. it is provided, that the Prelates, Earls, Barons, Commons, and Citizens, Burge&s;&s;es and Merchants, &s;hall not be charged to make any aid, if it be not by the common a&s;&s;ent of the great men, and Commons in Parliament: And as this fundamental principle had been &s;hamefully violated by &s;ucceeding Princes, it was made an article in the petition of right, third of King Cha. I. that no man &s;hall be compelled to yield any gift, loan, or benevolence, tax, or any &s;uch charge, without common con&s;ent, by act of Parliament; and again by the 1&s;t of William and Mary, &s;tat. 2, it is declared, that levying money for, or to the u&s;e of the crown, by pretence of preroga|tive, without grant of parliament, or for longer time, or in other manner, then the &s;ame is or &s;hall be granted, is illegal; and that the &s;ubjects do claim, demand, and in&s;i&s;t upon all and &s;ingular the premi&s;|es, as their antient undoubted rights and liberties. La&s;tly, the&s;e rights and liberties were a&s;&s;erted and confirmed, in the act of &s;ettlement which limited the crown, to the illu&s;trious hou&s;e of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;|ty,
<PB N="11" REF="014253_0010_0F93593C20FBCD48">
in the beginning of this century. Talliage from the French taille to cut, &s;ignifies a part cut or carv|ed out of the whole e&s;tate, and in a law &s;en&s;e in|cludes all &s;ub&s;idies, taxes, impo&s;itions, and duties what&s;oever, none of which might be taken without common con&s;ent in parliament. Hence, it is the an|tient and unalienable right of the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, to originate all money bills, they being the free donations of the people, and not the exactions of the Prince; upon the principle that civil govern|ment is con&s;tituted for the good of the people, and not the people for government: And there is no dif|ference in the rea&s;on and nature of the thing, between the King's levying money in England without con&s;ent of parliament, and the parliamant's levying money in America without the con&s;ent of the Ame|ricans.</P>
<P>3d. IN REGARD TO THE MODE OF TRIAL.</P>
<P>As it is not the laws merely, that are made, con|&s;idered in them&s;elves, but the con&s;truction and &s;en&s;e put upon them, by the judges and triers, that falls upon the &s;ubject and affects him in his per&s;on and property; it was nece&s;&s;ary that the con&s;titution &s;hould guard the rights of the &s;ubject, in the execu|tive as well as the legi&s;lative part of government: And no mode of trial would &s;o effectually do this, be &s;o unexceptionable, by rea&s;on of their equality, and the impartial manner in which they are taken and impanelled; &s;o advantageous, on account of their knowledge of the parties, the credibility of the witne&s;&s;es, and what weight ought to be given to their te&s;timony, as that by our peers, a jury of the vici|nity: For very good and whol&s;ome laws may be per|niciou&s;ly executed. Wherefore it is expre&s;ly provid|ed
<PB N="12" REF="014253_0011_0F93593CE02D0B98">
and ordained, in the Great Charter, chap. 29, <Q>That no freeman &s;hall be taken or di&s;&s;ei&s;ed of his freehold, or liberties, or free cu&s;toms, or be out|lawed, or exiled, or any otherwi&s;e de&s;troyed; and we will not pa&s;s &s;entence upon him, nor condemn him, but by lawful judgment of his peers; or by the laws of the land.</Q> By this no freeman might be mole&s;ted in his per&s;on, liberty or e&s;tate, but ac|cording to the laws of the land, by lawful warrant, granted by lawful authority, expre&s;&s;ing the cau&s;e for which, the time when, and place where he is to an|&s;wer or be impri&s;oned, with the terms of his enlarge|ment; nor have &s;entence pa&s;&s;ed upon him in any ca&s;e, but by lawful judgment of his peers; who, in the in&s;tance of giving their verdict, do unanimou&s;ly declare and announce the law, with re&s;pect to them|&s;elves, in like circum&s;tances. It is, &s;ays Dr. Black|&s;tone, the mo&s;t tran&s;cendant privilege which <Q>any &s;ubject can enjoy or wi&s;h for, that he cannot be affected in his property, his liberty or per&s;on, but by the unanimous con&s;ent of twelve of his neigh|bours and equals: And when a celebrated French writer concludes, that becau&s;e Rome, Sparta, and Carthage, lo&s;t their liberties, therefore England mu&s;t in time lo&s;e theirs, he &s;hould have recollect|ed, that Rome, Sparta, and Carthage were &s;tran|gers to trial by jury; and that it is a duty which every man owes to his country, his friends, his po&s;terity and him&s;elf, to maintain, to the utmo&s;t of his power, this valuable con&s;titution in all its parts, to re&s;tore it to its antient dignity, if at all impaired, or deviated from its fir&s;t in&s;titution, &amp;c. and above all, to guard with the mo&s;t jea|lous circum&s;pection, again&s;t the introduction of
<PB N="13" REF="014253_0012_0F93593F573665E8">
new and arbitrary methods of trial, which, under a variety of plau&s;ible pretences, may in time, im|perceptably undermine this be&s;t pre&s;ervative of Engli&s;h liberties.</Q> Engli&s;h &s;ubjects, therefore, could be bound by no laws, be liable to no taxes, but what were made and impo&s;ed by their own con&s;ent; nor have any &s;entence pa&s;&s;ed upon them but by the judgment of their equals. Glorious con&s;titution! worthy to be engraved in capitals of gold, on pillars of marble; to be perpetuated through all time, a barrier, to circum&s;cribe and bound the re&s;tle&s;s ambi|tion of a&s;piring monarchs, and the palladium of civil liberty; e&s;pecially, when in addition to the&s;e, we con&s;ider the Habeas Corpus act, pa&s;&s;ed in 31 Car. II. that &s;econd Magna Charta and &s;table bulwark of the &s;ubjects liberties, which provides a remedy for the immediate relief of &s;uch as are unju&s;tly impri|&s;oned, under colour of law. And enacts, that no &s;ubject of this our realm, who is an inhabitant of England, Wales, or Berwick, &s;hall be &s;ent a pri&s;o|ner to Scotland, Ireland, Jer&s;ey, Guern&s;ey, or places beyond the &s;eas, and all &s;uch impri&s;onments are de|clared illegal, the party cau&s;ing them di&s;abled to bear any office, incurs the penalty of a premunire, becomes incapable of the King's pardon, and al&s;o is to an&s;wer damages to the party aggrieved. <Q>Of great importance, &s;ays the above cited author, to the public, is the pre&s;ervation of per&s;onal liberty, for if once it was left in the power of any, the highe&s;t magi&s;trate, to impri&s;on arbitrarily, whom|&s;oever he or his officers thought proper (as in France is daily practi&s;ed by the crown) there would &s;oon be an end to all other rights and im|munities.</Q> How con&s;i&s;tent with the&s;e principles, the
<PB N="14" REF="014253_0013_0F935941547194E0">
pre&s;ent mode of admini&s;tring government is, the im|partial world may judge, by the late revenue and other acts of parliament, relative to America, directing its inhabitants to be impri&s;oned, and tran&s;ported beyond &s;ea for trial; erecting courts of admiralty, and other arbitrary tribunals, to decide in matters mo&s;t inte|re&s;ting, without the intervention of a jury.</P>
<P>The&s;e privileges, important and ine&s;timable as they are, every &s;ubject of the realm of England hath right to po&s;&s;e&s;s and enjoy. And the Americans, antecedent to their charters, &amp;c. if they were &s;till &s;ubjects of that realm, had right to have and enjoy in America. Now, if it was impo&s;&s;ible for the Americans, in their &s;ituation, to enjoy the rights and privileges of the Engli&s;h government, it follows, that they were not amenable to its power, nor taxable for its &s;upport; <HI>nam qui &s;entit onus, &s;entire debet commodum,</HI> he that bears the burden ought to enjoy the ble&s;&s;ing, and <HI>vice ver&s;a.</HI> Can any thing be more ab&s;urd, than that a man &s;hould be tied to a government, bound to yield &s;ubjection, and contribute &s;upport, wherever he is, on the face of the earth, without having any part or voice in its admini&s;tration, or power to enjoy its immunities. And that it was impo&s;&s;ible for the Americans to enjoy the privileges of the Engli&s;h government, is evident, there being no pro|vi&s;ion in the con&s;titution for &s;ummoning mem|bers to parliament from the American world; and if there was, the local di&s;tance, the ri&s;k and un|certainty of cro&s;&s;ing the atlantic, the di&s;parity be|tween the two countries, in re&s;pect of &s;ituation, numbers, age, abilities and other circum&s;tances, would render any repre&s;entation of America in the parliament of England, utterly impracticable and

vain. So that our ance&s;tors, in America, were un|able to exerci&s;e and enjoy that capital right of all Engli&s;h &s;ubjects, viz. the having a voice in the &s;upreme legi&s;lature, without which, as the <HI>cau&s;a &s;ine qua non,</HI> the parliament of England could not bind them in any re&s;pect. Hence the right of &s;ub|ject&s;hip, on the part of the Americans, and of juri&s;diction over them by parliament, became dor|mant, ineffectual rights, incapable of being exer|ci&s;ed; for the whole ground of the parliament's right to bind the Americans, con&s;i&s;ted in their being &s;ubjects; and for that very rea&s;on, if they were &s;ub|jects, the parliament could have no right to bind them, or exerci&s;e juri&s;diction over them, without their con&s;ent.</P>
<P>I will now enquire, whether the Americans, an|tecedent to their charters, &amp;c. are to he con&s;idered as being &s;ubjects of the kingdom of England, or not.</P>
<P>From what hath been already &s;aid, it is evident, that they either were not &s;ubjects of that kingdom, or as though they they were not: But this will be further illu&s;trated, by con&s;idering, in what &s;ubject|&s;hip con&s;i&s;ts: Compleat &s;ubject&s;hip<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By this is meant one that is a &s;ubject of the kingdom as well as of the King.</NOTE> con&s;i&s;ts in be|ing under allegiance to the King, inhabiting territories within the kingdom, in having, or at lea&s;t in being capable of having a voice in the &s;upreme legi&s;lature, and enjoying, or in being able to enjoy the benefits and immunities of the government.</P>
<P>Allegiance, from <HI>ligo,</HI> to bind, is the bond that connects the &s;ubjects with their &s;overeign, and their &s;overeign with them: Hence the King is called their

liege Lord, and they his liege &s;ubjects; becau&s;e he is bound to protect and they to obey. And there are three kinds of allegiance, natural, acquired, and local, every one born within the realm, is by birth, inheritable to the laws, intitled to the immunities of the government, and to the protection of the King; wherefore his allegiance, like St. Pauls, is natural: Every alien friend that comes into the realm, who by the King's letters patent is made a denizen, or by act of parliament is naturalized, hath an acquired allegiance; every alien friend that comes into the realm to re&s;ide for a time, oweth a local temporary allegiance, during his re&s;idence there. And the ob|ligation to obedience in all the&s;e ca&s;es, ari&s;es from the rea&s;on and fitne&s;s of things, and is comprehen&s;ively expre&s;&s;ed in this &s;hort law maxim, <HI>protectio trabit &s;ub|jectionem, &amp; &s;ubjectio protectionem,</HI> protection mutual|ly entitles to &s;ubjection, and &s;ubjection to protecti|on. Hence it follows (as mankind by joining to &s;o|ciety do not mean, nor doth allegiance intend to con|fine them perpetually to dwell in one country) that when a per&s;on, under a natural, acquired, or local allegiance removes out of the realm to &s;ome di&s;tant climate, goes out of the protection of the King, and lo&s;es all benefit of the laws and government of the kingdom; his allegiance, which is mutual or not at all, cea&s;eth, for <HI>ce&s;&s;ante cau&s;a ce&s;&s;et effectus,</HI> the cau&s;e or rea&s;on cea&s;ing, which in this ca&s;e is protection and the benefits of government, the effect, viz. the obli|gation of obedience al&s;o cea&s;eth. There is al&s;o what is called a legal allegiance, <HI>ex provi&s;ione legis,</HI> that is by po&s;itive in&s;titution, as the oath of allegiance taken by the &s;ubjects, wherein they &s;wear to bear all true and faithful allegiance to the King; which is a coun|ter

part to the King's coronation oath, whereby he &s;wears to protect his &s;ubjects in all their ju&s;t rights, to abjure popery, and maintain the prote&s;tant religi|on, to govern the kingdom and admini&s;ter ju&s;tice according to the laws of the realm. Both which are only confirmations of the mutual obligations re&s;ulting from the relation, that &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between them as King and &s;ubjects, and do attend upon and follow it, in its ex|tent and duration. I am not in&s;en&s;ible that it is a doctrine of antiquity, patronized by many, that na|tural allegiance is univer&s;al and perpetual; cannot be lo&s;t or forfeited, but by the commi&s;&s;ion of crimes, &amp;c. but notwith&s;tanding, I beg leave to &s;ugge&s;t a few con&s;iderations on this point. The place of a man's birth, in re&s;pect to him&s;elf, is a matter of ac|cident and nece&s;&s;ity, and not of choice; and is a man &s;o bound by accident and nece&s;&s;ity, as to the place of his birth, that when he arrives to the age of di&s;creti|on, he cannot remove into another kingdom and country, and become the &s;ubject of another prince? Doth not the obligation of &s;ubjection and obedience to parents, cea&s;e with our childhood and &s;tate of de|pendance, although that of re&s;pect and reverence e|ver remains? Should the King of Great-Britain vo|luntarily re&s;ign his crown, or abdicate the govern|ment, remove and re&s;ide in Italy, or enter into reli|gion, whereby he would be civilly dead, would he, notwith&s;tanding, be King, <HI>de jure &amp; de facto,</HI> and would the &s;ubjects be under obligation of allegiance to him, as their liege Lord? incapable of placing another on the throne, without incurring the crime of trea&s;on, or being involved in the dilemma of owing &s;ubjection to two rightful &s;overeigns, at one time?

authority, the principles of the revolution are fal&s;e; and no new &s;ubjects can ever be acquired, for all are born under allegiance to &s;ome prince or &s;tate; where, upon the&s;e principles, they mu&s;t ever remain, fixed as fate; and acquired allegiance, by act of parliament in England, is all a farce.</P>
<P>BUT be this as it may, yet &s;hould a number of the &s;ubjects of Great-Britain, under a natural alle|giance to the King, by his licence remove voluntari|ly, or by accident be carried to &s;ome di&s;tant, unci|vilized, or uninhabited country, where they &s;hould find it convenient and beneficial to &s;ettle; would they be incapable of erecting civil government, and mak|ing laws, for the well ordering of their affairs, inde|pendent of the King and kingdom? If &s;o, they would be of all men mo&s;t mi&s;erable, and their boa&s;ted &s;ub|ject&s;hip would be their greate&s;t calamity, becau&s;e they have the rights of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, they are ren|dered incapable of enjoying the rights of men. Up|on this contracted principle, no new countries could be peopled, or new empires founded; but all things mu&s;t remain as they were.

<P>It may be &s;aid, that the rea&s;on why natural alle|giance is perpetual, is not merely on account of our being born, &amp;c. but the protection and &s;upport of the government, afforded us where born; this is an obligation of debt.

<P>THE rights of a &s;ubject may be &s;u&s;pended for a time, with re&s;pect to the enjoyment and exerci&s;e of them, by &s;ome temporary impediment, which when removed they revive: But when the ob&s;tacle that &s;u&s;pends and impedes the exerci&s;e and enjoyment of them, is univer&s;al, permanent and perpetual, it is an extingui&s;hment of tho&s;e rights.

<P>NORTH-AMERICA was fir&s;t di&s;covered by Seba&s;tian Cabot, in the reign of Henry the 7th, A.

D. 1606 King James, by letters patent, erected two compa|nies called the Virginia Companies, with power to make &s;ettlements in America. Though none were made in New-England by virtue of that authority. About the clo&s;e of the &s;ixteenth century, &s;everal at|tempts were made for &s;ettling Virginia, before any proved &s;ucce&s;sful: The three fir&s;t companies that came all peri&s;hed, by hunger, di&s;ea&s;es or Indian cruelty: The fourth was reduced to almo&s;t the &s;ame &s;ituation, when Lord Delaware came to their relief. Thus Virginia, being the fir&s;t province that was &s;ettled in America, to her honour be it remem|bered, hath likewi&s;e been foremo&s;t in maintaining and vindicating the rights of the Americans.</P>

IN A.

The prote&s;tants, to the number of one hun|dred and fifty, who before had fled to Holland for &s;afety, having made a purcha&s;e under the Plymouth Company, and obtained the royal licence, quitted their native country, preferring the enjoyment of their religion and liberty, in a howling de&s;ert, to the pomp and plea&s;ures of luxury and &s;in in England; cro&s;&s;ed the Atlantic and arrived at Plymouth in A|merica in A. D. 1620, and by their own valour, in|du&s;try, ri&s;k and expence (under the &s;miles of Hea|ven) acquired plantations, &s;ubdued &s;avage enemies, built cities, turned the wilderne&s;s into fruitful fields, and rendered it vocal with the prai&s;es of their Savi|our, and from &s;mall beginnings, in proce&s;s of time, became great in number, and in extent of territory; Great numbers, not long after, from religious con&s;i|derations, emigrating from.

both the ruler and the &s;ubjects depend; nor may they be altered or changed by ruler or people, but by the whole collective body, or a major part at lea&s;t, nor may they be touched by the legi&s;lator; for the moment that alters e&s;&s;entially the con&s;titution, it annihilates its own exi&s;tence, its con&s;titutional autho|rity. Not only &s;o, but on &s;uppo&s;ition the legi&s;lator might alter it; &s;uch a &s;tretch of power would be dangerous beyond conception; for could the Briti&s;h parliament alter the original principles of the con&s;ti|tution, the people might be deprived of their liber|ties and properties, and the parliament become ab&s;o|lute and perpetual; and for redre&s;s in &s;uch ca&s;e, &s;hould it ever happen, they mu&s;t re&s;ort to their na|tive rights, and be ju&s;tified in making in&s;urrection.

In which of the&s;e lights they &s;hould be con&s;idered, I leave the imparti|al world to judge.

If the la&s;t, then all the&s;e rights of juri&s;diction, of property and liberty, were underived and &s;elf-originated.

All have their courts of judicature, to take cognizance of all cau&s;es, ari&s;ing within their territorial limits, and the power of judg|ing in the la&s;t re&s;ort, though this right hath been in|fringed in &s;undry in&s;tances, by appeals to the king and council. But how a judgment in England can be executed in America, according to the cour&s;e of law, is to me a paradox.</P>

and acting under and in pur&s;uance of the royal licence and authority of their king? It is certain that the colonies, in all their con&s;titutions, were con&s;idered as being out of the juri&s;diction of parliament, from the provi&s;ions made in every one, to &s;upply the want of &s;uch juri&s;diction, by inve&s;ting their &s;everal a&s;&s;emblies with &s;upreme power of legi&s;lation; and that their kings ever con&s;idered and treated them as being &s;o, until that fatal period when George Grenville, that mon&s;ter of mini&s;ters, came into admini&s;tration; and that the colonies &s;o under&s;tood them&s;elves to be.</P>
<P>From all which I think we may infer, with great clear|ne&s;s and certainty, that he that is king of Great-Britain, is, by the con&s;titutions of the colonies, al&s;o king of the American colonies, bound to protect and govern them according to their &s;everal con&s;titutions, and not to de|&s;troy them: and that the parliament hath no juri&s;dic|tion or power with re&s;pect to them; for the parlia|ment con&s;i&s;ts of the three e&s;tates, the king, lords and commons, and was con&s;tituted for the government of that realm; and the king &s;u&s;tains a three-fold capa|city, as king of Great-Britain, the fir&s;t of the three e|&s;tates in parliament, and as king of the American co|lonies, and according to the maxim of the Engli&s;h laws, <HI>Quando duo jura concurrent in una &amp; eadem per&s;ona, idem e&s;t, ac &s;i e&s;&s;ent in diver&s;is;</HI> when &s;everal rights or capa|cities meet and are ve&s;ted in one and the &s;ame per&s;on, they remain entire, and as di&s;tinct as though they were ve&s;ted in different per&s;ons. This right of &s;overeignty over the Americans, is derived from a different &s;ource from that of Great-Britain, viz. the con&s;titutions of the colonies, extends to different objects, viz. the colonies, and is exerci&s;able in a different manner, viz. according to their &s;everal con&s;titutions. And what the king
<PB N="35" REF="014253_0034_0F935955A08053E8">
doth as king of Great-Britain, or as one of the e&s;tates in parliament, he doth not as king of the colonies; for if &s;o, then all the judges and officers appointed in the realm of England, would be judges and officers in America; all the laws and taxes that receive the roy|al a&s;&s;ent in parliament, would immediately be binding upon the Americans, unle&s;s expre&s;ly excepted; con|trary to the united voice of all their princes, politici|ans and lawyers, which is, that even Ireland, which they hold as a conquered country, is not bound by acts of parliament, unle&s;s &s;pecially named. The Lords being the noble peers of that realm, &s;et in par|liament in right of their e&s;tates and dignity, their au|thority cannot extend beyond the limits of the king|dom of which they are peers. The Hou&s;e of Com|mons, act by a delegated authority, and can have no greater power than their con&s;tituents can give, and their con&s;tituents can give no greater than they have; and from whence, in the name of common &s;en&s;e, have the people of Great-Britain right of dominion over the per&s;ons, properties and liberties of the good peo|ple in America?</P>
<P>BUT &s;ome may object, that upon the&s;e principles, the colonies have an unlimited power of legi&s;lation, &amp;c. within them&s;elves, contrary to an expre&s;s clau&s;e in their con&s;titutions, which re&s;trains them from making laws, &amp;c. contrary to the laws of the realm of England.</P>
<P>THESE con&s;titutions are to be con&s;idered, not on|ly as the &s;tipulations of the &s;overeign and the particu|lar colonies with whom they are made, but al&s;o of the coloni&s;ts among them&s;elvs; although they are conceived wholly in the &s;tyle and language of grants from the crown.

<P>THIS re&s;traint to colony legi&s;lation, cannot be con|&s;trued to extend the juri&s;diction of parliament; for if it could, it would be repugnant to the grant, &amp; void; for parliament might make laws contrary to all the laws the colonies have or could make; in this &s;en&s;e, it would be re&s;erving a power that would devour and de&s;troy all the powers con&s;tituted and granted in the patents, &amp;c.</P>
<P>NOR is it to be under&s;tood, that the colonies may not make laws re&s;pecting their own people, which are contrary to laws in England, concerning a &s;i|milar matter; for in&s;tance, in England the laws per|mit per&s;ons of certain rank and e&s;tate to play at games; in the colonies all per&s;ons without di&s;tincti|on are prohibited playing at games.

As the con|&s;titutions of the colonies were founded on the &s;ame principles with that of England, and the coloni&s;ts entitled to like privileges with the natural &s;ubjects

To the genius of the laws and civil con&s;titution of this our realm of England; for &s;uch would likewi&s;e be contrary to the genius of their own governments. Between which and the Engli&s;h con&s;titution there is &s;uch a &s;imilarity, that you can|not thwart the principles of one, without contra|dicting the &s;pirit of the other; and the &s;word that pierces the &s;ides of one, penetrates the bowels of the other. This re&s;triction is limited to the laws or &s;y&s;|tem of government then in being in and over that realm: and doth not extend to any civil con&s;titutions that might afterwards be made; nor to any laws made, or that &s;hould be made there, to extend to the colo|nies, out of that realm; for this would, as hath been &s;hewn, be repugnant to the grant; and further, &s;uch would not be the laws of that realm, but of the colo|nies. This clau&s;e therefore, in&s;tead of re&s;training the colonies under the power of parliament, doth de|mon&s;trate them to be di&s;tinct &s;tates, without and in|dependent of the juri&s;diction of parliament.</P>

<P>IT is not the parliament's declaring a thing to be &s;o, that makes it &s;o, nor their enjoining a thing to be done, that makes it a duty to do it.

<P>THE obligation of obedience to a law, ari&s;es whol|ly from the authority of the makers, over tho&s;e on whom it is enjoined; &s;o that if the Americans are na|turally independant of the power of parliament, and by no conce&s;&s;ions and civil con&s;titutions of their own have &s;ubmitted thereto, and put them&s;elves under it; no acts of parliament can make them dependant.

<P>I CANNOT but remark upon the &s;ingular phra&s;eolo|gy of this declaratory act of parliament, viz. that all his Maje&s;ty's colonies (not our colonies) have been, are, and of right ought to be &s;ubordinate to, and depen|dant on the imperial crown and parliament of Great-Britain, who have full power and authority to make laws and &s;tatutes of &s;ufficient validity to bind the co|lonies and people in America, &s;ubjects of the crown of Great-Britain, in all ca&s;es what&s;oever.

evident from what has been &s;aid, that the King's right of &s;overeignty over the colonies is not derived from, or holden in virtue of his crown, as King of Great-Britain; but from the particular &s;tipulations entered into with the colonies by their &s;everal con&s;ti|tutions; otherwi&s;e their con&s;titutions would have been idle and unnece&s;&s;ary. Nor will it help the mat|ter, &s;hould we for argument's &s;ake, yield to them that the colonies were &s;ubjects of the crown of Great-Britain; then they would be entitled to the privileges of &s;ubjects, which is an exemption from legi&s;lati|on or taxation without their voice or con&s;ent. So that whether the colonies are or are not &s;ubjects of the crown of Great-Britain, the act is altogether un|founded.</P>
<P>BUT it may be objected to the colonies claim of exemption from the juri&s;diction of parliament on account of their not being repre&s;ented; that there are many per&s;ons of property, and large towns in England who do not vote in the election of repre|&s;entatives to parliament, yet are bound by its laws, &amp;c. There is no borough, city, town, or &s;hire in England, nor any man of competent e&s;tate and a &s;ubject of the kingdom, but what may have a voice in the election of repre&s;entatives to parliament; if, therefore, &s;ome do wave a privilege which they might enjoy, their &s;tupidity ought to be a warning, and not an example for the Americans to imitate: Nor doth it by any means follow, that becau&s;e &s;ome are bound, who might and will not &s;end repre&s;entatives; that therefore, the parliament hath right to bind all, even tho&s;e who cannot, if they would, be repre&s;ented. Be|&s;ides, every member of parliament, though c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;en by one particular di&s;trict, when elected and returned,

&s;erves for the whole realm; and no laws or taxes are made and impo&s;ed on &s;uch, but what equally affect tho&s;e that make them, and their con&s;tituents. The ca&s;e of the unrepre&s;ented Americans is directly the rever&s;e; they cannot be repre&s;ented, and the bur|thens laid on them proportionably alleviate the bur|thens of tho&s;e that impo&s;e them, and their con&s;tituents.</P>
<P>AGAIN, it may be objected, that &s;everal acts of parliament re&s;pecting America, have been acquie&s;ced in, &amp;c. Neither the parliament's making laws, nor the American's acquie&s;cing therein, can create an au|thority to make them on one hand, nor an obligation to obey them on the other, though they may be con&s;idered as &s;ome evidence thereof. From the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of the colonies, to the conclu&s;ion of the la&s;t war, no tax|es, or duties have been claimed, or impo&s;ed by act of parliament in America, for the purpo&s;e of rai&s;ing a revenue, unle&s;s the act re&s;pecting the po&s;t-office is con&s;idered as &s;uch. The fir&s;t act that was made to extend to America, equally extended to A&s;ia and A|frica; and was made in the 12th of Charles II. mere|ly for the regulation of trade; requiring all Engli&s;h goods to be &s;hipped in Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;els, and navigated by Engli&s;h mariners. The 25th of the &s;ame reign produced the fir&s;t act that impo&s;ed duties for any purpo&s;e in America, and the preamble declares it to be for the regulation of trade only; nor are the avails appropriated to any part of the revenue: Yet this produced an in&s;urrection in Virginia, agents were &s;ent to England on the account; and a declaration obtained from the King under his privy &s;eal, dated April 19th, A. D. 1676 <Q>That taxes ought not to be laid upon the proprietors and inhabitants of the colony, but by the common con&s;ent of the Gene|ral

A&s;&s;embly.</Q> The other acts that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;pected the colonies, except the 7 and 8 of Will. III. antea, were for the regulation of trade only, until of late; the duties were never acquie&s;ced in, were always murmered at, prote&s;ted again&s;t, as being oppre&s;&s;ive and unju&s;t, and eluded as far as po&s;&s;ible. And as the trade of the colonies was, of choice, principal|ly with Great-Britain and the Briti&s;h I&s;lands, many of tho&s;e acts did not much affect them in their intere&s;t or inclination. If &s;uch an acquie&s;cence may be con|&s;trued a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to acts of parliament; the nonu&s;|er of &s;uch power by parliament, for &s;o long a time, may, with greater rea&s;on, be con&s;trued a relinqui&s;h|ment thereof. For the non u&s;er of a power, by tho&s;e that are able to exerci&s;e &s;uch power, is greater evi|dence again&s;t the exi&s;tence of it, than the non-re&s;i&s;tence of thou&s;ands is for it, who are incapable of making re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>BUT it will be &s;aid that the po&s;t-office in America was by act of parliament and is for the expre&s;s pur|po&s;e of rai&s;ing a revenue.</P>
<P>THE po&s;t-office is a convenient and u&s;eful in&s;ti|tution, and on that account, it hath been received and u&s;ed in America, and not on account of the act of parliament; and derives all its authority, in A|merica, from its being received and adopted there: As many of the rules of the Roman civil law, are received and adopted by univer&s;al con&s;ent in Eng|land, and are obligatory upon the people; not from the authority of the Roman Emperors that ordained them, but from their own act in receiving and adopt|ing them. Further, the act of parliament forbids all per&s;ons to carry or tran&s;port any letters, &amp;c. by land or water, on pain of &s;evere penalties, except the po&s;t|ma&s;ter
<PB N="43" REF="014253_0042_0F93595B996DEB10">
or his deputies: And it is well known, that this part of the act was daily violated; yet no per&s;on was ever pro&s;ecuted: Which &s;hews that the po&s;t-of|fice in America was not &s;uch, as the parliament had enacted; but &s;uch as the univer&s;al con&s;ent and prac|tice of the people there had made it; and al&s;o, how lit|tle deference is paid to acts of parliament in Ame|rica.</P>
<P>From all the ca&s;es of pretended acquie&s;cence to acts of parliament, nothing can be inferred favoura|ble to the juri&s;diction of parliament, for either it was for the intere&s;t of the Americans to comply with them, or it was not; if the former, then they com|plied, not from a principle of obedience to them; but from motives of intere&s;t and inclination; if the latter, then they demon&s;trate the incompetency of par|liament to make laws for the Americans; who thro' ignorance, or &s;ome other principle, hath enjoined what is prejudicial. And no wi&s;e con&s;titution would ve&s;t a power in any body of men, who, from their &s;itua|tion and circum&s;tances, are and mu&s;t be, nece&s;&s;arily incompetent for the proper exerci&s;e of it.</P>
<P>IT may be objected, that all the&s;e charters and co|lony con&s;titutions were made by and with the King, in his political capacity, as the &s;upreme head of the kingdom; and that whatever he doth as &s;uch, is in virtue of authority derived from the kingdom; and for the u&s;e and benefit thereof, and not with and for the King only.</P>
<P>THESE con&s;titutions, are either the compacts of both the king and kingdom of Great-Britain with the colonies; entered into by the King for him&s;elf, and in behalf of his kingdom, or they are the compacts of the King only.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="014253_0043_0F93595D983B81A8">
IF the former, then the kingdom of Great-Britain, as well as the King, is a party to them, bound and concluded by them; and can have no greater authori|ty over the colonies, than is therein expre&s;sly &s;tipu|lated, and in no other manner than is therein provid|ed. For if the kingdom will take the benefit of the King's acts, it mu&s;t in tho&s;e re&s;pects, be likewi&s;e bound by them. And there is not the lea&s;t colour of legi&s;lative authority in the colony con&s;titutions, &s;ti|pulated or re&s;erved to the parliament, over the per|&s;ons or properties of the Americans, except in one or two in&s;tances, which are altogether &s;ingular, and as ab&s;urd as &s;ingular, but full and compleat power of legi&s;lation is ve&s;ted in the General A&s;&s;emblies of the &s;everal colonies&mdash;&s;ubject only in &s;ome, to the royal di&s;&s;ent within a limited time; and to have the colony A&s;&s;emblies, &s;ubject at the &s;ame time to the legi&s;lative power of Parliament, would be con&s;ti|tuting an <HI>imperium in imperio,</HI> one &s;upreme power within another, the height of political ab&s;urdity.</P>
<P>BUT if the&s;e con&s;titutions, are the compacts of the King, only with the colonies, then the kingdom and parliament of Great-Britain have no power over them, more than they and their A&s;&s;emblies have over the kingdom and parliament, for they are di&s;tinct &s;i&s;ter &s;tates, neither having any power or authority over the other. And that the&s;e con&s;titutions, were entered into and granted by the King for him&s;elf only, is evident, in that, no mention is made in them of the parliament, except as above, and in them the re&s;ervation is void, being again&s;t Magna Charta: Or of their being made by the King, in behalf of him&s;elf and kingdom; and this mo&s;t certainly the King is capable of doing; for the King con&s;idered in his natural capacity as a man,

<P>IN his political capacity he al&s;o hath certain prero|gatives, royal rights and intere&s;ts, which are his own, and not the kingdom's; and the&s;e he may alienate by gift or &s;ale, &amp;c.</P>
<P>SHOULD France offer the King of Great-Britain the crown of that kingdom, and he accept it; could not France be &s;ubject to the King, without being &s;ubject to the kingdom of Great-Britain, and &s;ubordinate to the power of parliament? Upon the&s;e principles, &s;hould the King of England be elected Emperor of Germany, the Briti&s;h parliament, would legi&s;late for the whole Germanic body. And the ca&s;e would not be otherwi&s;e, with a people in a &s;tate of nature, that &s;hould make choice of the King of Great-Britain for their King, and he accept thereof, they would not thereby, elect the kingdom for their ma&s;ters nor be &s;ubjected to its parliament. Thus, whether the&s;e con|&s;titutions are con&s;idered as the compacts of the King and kingdom of Great-Britain, or only of the King, the colonies are clearly out of the reach of the juri&s;|diction of parliament,&mdash;and it is evident that they were originally intended &s;o to be, and all the advan|tages expected from them by Great-Britain, were their trade, which has far exceeded their mo&s;t &s;an|guine expectations. For the&s;e con&s;titutions were not entered into and granted by the King in virtue of his being the King of Great-Britain; the King of France or Pru&s;&s;ia might have done the &s;ame; or any indivi|dual, the Americans &s;hould have elected for their

King. The force and authority of the&s;e con&s;tituti|ons, is not derived from any antecedent right in the crown of Great-Britain to grant them; but from the mutual agreements and &s;tipulations contained in them, between the crown of Great-Britain and the colonies.</P>
<P>FURTHER, it is objected, that the &s;ettlement of the crown is by act of parliament; and the colonies do acknowledge him to be their King, on whom the crown is thus &s;ettled, con&s;equently in this they do recognize the power of parliament.</P>
<P>THE colonies do and ever did acknowledge the power of parliament to &s;ettle and determine who hath right, and who &s;hall wear the crown of Great-Britain; but it is by force of the con&s;titutions of the colo|nies only, that he, who is thus crowned King of Great-Britain, becomes King of the colonies. One de&s;ignates the King of the colonies, and the other makes him &s;o.</P>
<P>LASTLY it is objected, that in all civil &s;tates it is nece&s;&s;ary, there &s;hould &s;ome where be lodged a &s;u|preme power over the whole.</P>
<P>THE truth of this objection will not be conte&s;ted; but its application in the pre&s;ent argument is to be con&s;idered. If Great-Britain and America both con|&s;titute but one civil &s;tate, then it is nece&s;&s;ary that there &s;hould be one &s;upreme power, lodged either in Great-Britain or America, in &s;uch manner as is con|&s;i&s;tent with the liberties of the &s;ubjects. But if they are di&s;tinct &s;tates, then it is nece&s;&s;ary, that there &s;hould be a &s;upreme power lodged in each. The on|ly thing then to be done is to prove, that Great-Bri|tain and America are di&s;tinct &s;tates. And this point hath been already con&s;idered; &s;o that little new can be &s;aid upon it. However it may be ob&s;erved, that
<PB N="47" REF="014253_0046_0F9359608C8A3098">
a civil &s;tate, is a country or body of people that are connected and united under one and the &s;ame con&s;ti|tution of civil government; by this the kingdoms and &s;tates in Germany and other parts of Europe are di&s;tingui&s;hed and known. Now there is no &s;uch ci|vil con&s;titution exi&s;ting, as that of Great-Britain and America.</P>
<P>GREAT-BRITAIN hath its civil con&s;titution; the colonies have their's; and though, the &s;pirit and prin|ciples of them are &s;imilar, yet the con&s;titutions of the two countries are entirely di&s;tinct and &s;everal: The con&s;titution of Great-Britain is not the con&s;titution of the colonies, nor <HI>vice ver&s;a.</HI> They are two countries, three thou&s;and miles di&s;tant from each other, inhabit|ed by different people, under di&s;tinct con&s;titutions of government, with different cu&s;toms, laws and in|tere&s;ts, both having one King. Now, if any can be|lieve that Great-Britain and America are but one ci|vil &s;tate, they mu&s;t overthrow the doctrine of identi|ty and diver&s;ity, confound all di&s;tin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="5 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> nature, and believe that two is one and one is two.

And the con&s;titutions of civil government ought to be erected on the foundation of rea&s;on and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">conformable to the nature of things; nor is it difficult to conceive of two di&s;tinct countries, independent of each other, each having its own civil con&s;titutions, laws, parlia|ments, courts, commerce and intere&s;t, united under one &s;overeign Prince. And would it be nece&s;&s;ary that there &s;hould be in one of the&s;e &s;tates, a &s;upreme power over the per&s;ons and properties of the other?

in &s;uch ca&s;e that the &s;ubjects of one &s;hould be &s;laves to the other, incapable of liberty or property. Are not Hanover and Saxony di&s;tinct &s;tates, both within the empire, and &s;ubordinate to the imperial crown of Germany? They are. And is not this the ca&s;e of Great-Britain and America?

<P>THUS, the que&s;tion is reduced to a &s;ingle point, ei|ther the parliament hath no &s;uch power over the per|&s;ons and properties, of the Americans as is claimed, or the Americans <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;laves Slavery con&s;i&s;ts in being wholly under the power and controul of another, as to our actions and properties: And he that hath authority to re&s;train and controul my conduct in any in&s;tance, without my con&s;ent, hath in all.

All is our's, and nothing can be taken from us, but by our con&s;ent; or nothing is our's, and all may be taken, without our con&s;ent. The right of dominion over the per&s;ons and proper|ties of others, is not natural, but derived; and there are but two &s;ources from whence it can be derived; from the almighty, who is the ab&s;olute proprietor of all, and from our own free con&s;ent.

<P>THE que&s;tion is not whether the king is to be o|beyed or not, for the Americans, have ever recognized his authority as their rightful &s;overeign, and liege lord; have ever been ready, with their lives and for|tunes, to &s;upport his crown and government, accord|ing to the con&s;titutions of the nation; and now call upon him as their liege lord (whom he is bound to protect) for protection, on pain of their allegiance, again&s;t the army, levied by the Briti&s;h parliament, a|gain&s;t his loyal and dutiful &s;ubjects in America.</P>

old colonies, except for a&s;&s;i&s;tance afforded them a|gain&s;t their enemies in war, and protection to their trade at &s;ea; for the lands were neither acquired or &s;ettled at the expence of the crown. New York, in|deed, was obtained by conque&s;t from the Dutch, without much ri&s;k or lo&s;s; and was afterwards in the treaty at Breda, A. D. 1667, confirmed to the Eng|li&s;h in exchange for Surinam. Nor have tho&s;e colo|nies &s;ince, been any expence to the crown, either for &s;upport of their governments, or inhabitants: And the Americans have had no enemies but what were equally the enemies of Great-Britain; nor been en|gaged in any wars, but what the nation was equally engaged in, except the wars with the Indians; which they carried on and maintained them&s;elves. It will be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tate the advantages the Americans have been to Great-Britain, as well as tho&s;e they have derived from thence, by a&s;&s;i&s;tance afforded in the wars, and by comparing, &s;trike the ballance.</P>
<P>FROM the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of the colonies, they have been almo&s;t continually engaged in a bloody and ex|pen&s;ive, tho' &s;ucce&s;sful war with the French and Indi|ans, on their frontiers, until the reduction of Canada; whereby their &s;ettlements were extended; and by a ra|pid population, the number of inhabitants have been greatly encrea&s;ed; and the trade to England pro|portionably augmented. In A. D. 1690, Sir William Phips rai&s;ed an army in New-England, took Port Royal, or Annapolis, in Nova-Scotia, from the French; and reduced another &s;ettlement of con&s;iderable con&s;e|quence, at the mouth of the river St. John's, on the Bay of Fundy, both which, king William ceded to the French at the peace of Ri&s;wick, A. D. 1697; and received an equivalent for them. In A. D. 1703,
<PB N="54" REF="014253_0053_0F93596CD91693B0">
the beginning of Queen Ann's war, Annapolis was retaken, by the New-England people. Afterwards Sir William Phips, with the New-England People, attempted the reduction of Canada, and was obliged to return, not by the arms of the enemy, but by the &s;everity of the &s;ea&s;on coming on earlier than u&s;ual: However, he built a fort on the mouth of Pemaquid on the frontiers of the country, which reduced all the Indians, North We&s;t of Merimac river, under the crown of England. By the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es, Great-Britain was induced to engage in an expedition again&s;t Que|bec. In A. D. 1711, Admiral Walker was &s;ent to Bo&s;ton, with a fleet, and &s;ome land forces; New-England furni&s;hed their quota of troops for the expe|dition; but by rea&s;on of the great fogs, and &s;ome mi&s;take of the pilot's, part of the fleet was &s;tove upon the rocks; eight hundred of the men lo&s;t, and the expedition rendered abortive. Annapolis, and all Nova-Scotia was confirmed to Great-Britain, at the peace of Utrecht, A. D. 1713; whereby all that country, its valuable fi&s;heries, and trade, were added to the crown of Great-Britain. Not to mention the ineffectual, but co&s;tly expedition, formed by the New-England people again&s;t Canada, in A. D. 1740; and that again&s;t the I&s;land of Cuba, at another time. On the 16th of June, A. D. 1745, the important fortre&s;s of Loui&s;bourgh &s;urrendered to Commodore Warren, and Mr. Pepperel; reduced by a long and peril|ous &s;iege of forty-nine days (through the &s;miles of heaven) by the valour and intrepidity of American troops, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Commodore Warren, with a &s;mall &s;quadron in the harbour; by which, the command of the Newfoundland fi&s;hery, the gulph of St. Law|rence, the only pa&s;s by &s;ea to Quebec, the capital of
<PB N="55" REF="014253_0054_0F93596D9974DC68">
the capital of the French &s;ettlements in America, fell into the hands of the Engli&s;h, and which afterwards purcha&s;ed the peace of Europe, and procured to the crown of England, in the peace of Aix Chappelle, &s;undry important places that had been taken. Thus, the Americans laboured, fought and toiled; and the Britons reaped the advantage. The noble exertions of the Americans, and the part they took in the la&s;t war; their laudable emulation to be foremo&s;t, in complying with the requi&s;itions of their &s;overeign; their troops contending for &s;tations of danger, as po&s;ts of di&s;tinction; e&s;teeming their lives and their pro|perties, an incon&s;iderable &s;acrifice, for the glory of their king, and the renown of his arms; and the large levies of men and money made by them, are fre&s;h in every one's memory. The amazing advantages de|rived from the war in America, to the crown and kingdom of Great-Britain, is al&s;o well known. The whole ea&s;tern and northern country, the New-found|land fi&s;hery, trade, and navigation, a &s;ource of bound|le&s;s wealth; the i&s;land of Cape-Breton, the exten&s;ive country of Canada and Loui&s;iana, from the arctic pole, to the tropic of Cancer, with their train of fortre&s;&s;es, lakes, &amp;c. the peltry and furr trade of that whole country, with the almo&s;t inexhau&s;table trea&s;ures of the Havanna; a harve&s;t in which the Americans, with the Britons, bore the heat and burthen of the day; yet the Americans &s;hared little or none of the fruit, except being delivered from trouble&s;ome neighbours, on their frontiers, and &s;ome individuals drawing a &s;hare in the plunder, at the Havanna. And what a mighty acce&s;&s;ion of weight and importance was this, to the crown of Great-Britain, in the &s;cale of power, among the European &s;tates and princes! But why need I dwell upon the&s;e? At the conclu&s;ion
<PB N="56" REF="014253_0055_0F93596E62DB37C0">
of the la&s;t war, ju&s;tice &s;wayed the &s;ceptre; and a a righteous mini&s;ter had the royal ear; the Americans were con&s;idered as creditors to the nation; and thou|&s;ands of pounds were &s;ent over to reimbur&s;e them. But Oh! the &s;ad rever&s;e of times, mini&s;ters and of mea&s;ures!</P>
<P>IN the next place, let me enquire, in re&s;pect to the protection afforded our trade at &s;ea. Our trade, from inclination and choice, hath been principally with Great-Britain and the Briti&s;h i&s;les, and like the trade in all ca&s;es, carried on between an infant country, in want of all kinds of manufactures, and an old, weal|thy, manufacturing kingdom. Our's was of nece&s;&s;i|ty and for con&s;umption; their's for profit and ad|vantage. They purcha&s;ed of us our raw materials, and &s;old to us their wrought manufactures; both at their own price, and at their own ports. In this view of the matter, mu&s;t it not be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the ad|vantages of this trade to that kingdom, amply paid for its protection; and their motives to protect it were thier own emolument and profit? But this will be more fully illu&s;trated, when we con&s;ider, that the amount of the trade between Great-Britain, and the colonies, at a medium for three years, before it was interrupted by the&s;e unhappy di&s;putes, is computed at about three millions, three hundred and eighty-five thou&s;and pounds per annum: From which deduct a certain proportion, for raw materials, that are import|ed into England, which is comparatively incon&s;ider|able; the remainder is a clear profit and gain to Great-Britain; and is divided between the public exche|quer, and private coffers&mdash;for the whole co&s;t of the raw materials, the duties on the importation of them, the manufacturer's labour, his living and his family's, his taxes upon his hou&s;e, windows, &s;alt, &s;oap, candles,
<PB N="57" REF="014253_0056_0F93596F14FFB798">
coal, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. upon his eatables, his drinkables, and cloathing; tho&s;e of his family, his apprentices and journeymen; and not only &s;o, but al&s;o the taxes his &s;hoemaker, weaver, and taylor paid, when working for him; the merchants profits, the charges of bailage, truckage, freight, in&s;urance; and the duties upon the articles them&s;elves, all go in to make up the price, and are paid by the American con&s;umer. In this view of the matter, I believe I am within bounds to &s;uppo&s;e, that the direct trade, (leaving out of the que&s;tion the cercuitous trade by way of the We&s;t-Indies and other parts) neats a profit of three millions to Great-Britain: And near one halt of that &s;um, is made up of taxes and duties, which are paid in England; whereby the public revenue is &s;o much increa&s;ed &amp; eventually is actually paid by the Americans.</P>
<P>CAN any &s;uppo&s;e, that this is not an ample compen|&s;ation, for all the protection afforded our trade at &s;ea? What nation in Europe would not rejoice to receive our trade on the&s;e terms, and give us thou&s;ands for its pur|cha&s;e? But, upon &s;uppo&s;ition it is not &s;ufficient, and that the colonies are indebted to them; ought they not to &s;tate the account, that the balance might be &s;een; and to make a demand of payment? And not without doing either, thru&s;t their hands into our pockets; and rend from thence, not only what we owe them, but what they plea&s;e: Not only what we ought to pay, but our whole property; nor that only, but our liberties too. And if a&s;ked wherefore this? the an&s;wer is, that the nation is indebt, and that we owe them. If we owe them, let them make it appear, and the colonies will pay them; that the nation is in debt, needs no proof; but for what? For expence in war, and for charges of government in time of peace? Could the&s;e have ac|cumulated&mdash;the enormous &s;um of 145,000000, the na|tional debt in A. D. 1766? Bribery and corruption, luxury and exorbitant pen&s;ions multiplied, might.</P>

BUT it is time to clo&s;e the&s;e enquiries; and what may we not expect, from what is threatened and already done, that is in the power of parliament to do?</P>
<P>IS not the King of Great-Britain, the vi&s;ible head of the chri&s;tian church in England? and by the Quebec bill, is he not, as amply con&s;tituted the head of the ro|mi&s;h church in Canada? Have not the Americans, by the con&s;titution of nature, as men, by the con&s;titution of England, as Engli&s;hmen, and by the con&s;titutions in America, as coloni&s;ts; a right of exemption from all laws, that are made, and taxes that are impo&s;ed, with|out their voice and con&s;ent? And from other mode of trial, than by their peers of the vicinity?</P>
<P>AND by the late acts of parliament, are not taxes and duties impo&s;ed, and laws enacted to bind them, not only without, but in which, they neither had nor could have any voice? And is not the whole government, of that ancient province of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, demoli&s;hed at a blow, by an engine of tyranny, without being &s;ummoned, heard or tried? Are not &s;trange and unu&s;|ual methods for impri&s;onment, tran&s;portation and trial, introduced? Arbitrary tribunals erected, to decide in matters mo&s;t intere&s;ting, without the intervention of a jury? In a word, are not all our rights and liberties, na|tural, religious and civil, made a mark for their arrows, and threatened to be laid in the du&s;t? And to compleat our ruin, are not our harbours blocked up? our coa&s;ts lined with fleets? our country filled with armed troops? our towns &s;acked? inhabitants plundered? friends &s;laughtered? our plea&s;ant places de&s;olated with fire and &s;word? all announced rebels? our e&s;tates declared for|feit; and our blood eagerly panted for? When I think of Bo&s;ton, that unhappy capital; what &s;he once was, and the mi&s;erable captive &s;tate, to which &s;he is now re|duced, I am almo&s;t ready to adopt the plaintive &s;trains of captive I&s;rael concerning her: <Q>By the rivers of Ba|bylon

there we &s;et down, yea, we wept when we re|membered Zion; we hanged our harps upon the wil|lows, in the mid&s;t thereof, for there they that carried us captive and wa&s;ted us, required of us a &s;ong and mirth, &s;aying, &s;ing us one of the &s;ongs of Zion. How &s;hall we &s;ing the Lord's &s;ong in a &s;trange land? if I forget thee Oh Jeru&s;alem! let my right hand forget her cunning, if I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Je|ru&s;alem, above my chief joy. Remember O Lord! the children of Edom, in the day of Jeru&s;alem, who &s;aid ra&s;e it, ra&s;e it, even to the foundation thereof.</Q></P>
<P>WHAT &s;hall we &s;ay, is there any force in &s;acred com|pacts and national con&s;titutions? any honour in crowned heads? any faith to be put in mini&s;ters, the nobles and great men of the nation? In a word, is there any &s;uch thing as truth and ju&s;tice? Is there not a power above us? and that there is all nature declares; the vindicator of right and avenger of wrong. To him therefore we make our la&s;t appeal; and to the impartial world, to judge between Great-Britain and America.</P>
<P>THESE unheard of intolerable calamities, &s;pring not of the du&s;t, come not cau&s;ele&s;s, nor will they end fruit|le&s;s. THEY call on the Americans for repentance towards their maker, and vengeance on their adver&s;aries. And can it be a crime to re&s;i&s;t? Is it not a duty we owe to our maker, to our country, to our&s;elves and to po&s;teri|ty? Does not the principle of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, which is implanted by the author of nature in the human brea&s;t, (to operate in&s;tantaneous as the lightning, re&s;i&s;tle&s;s as the &s;hafts of war, to ward of impending danger) urge us to the conflict; add wings to our feet, firmne&s;s and unanimity to our hearts, impenatrability to our battali|ons, and under the influence of its mighty author, will it not render &s;ucce&s;sful and glorious American arms? But it may be &s;aid that the Americans have de&s;troyed the
<PB N="60" REF="014253_0059_0F9359729CDBAA30">
tea of the Ea&s;t-India company, at Bo&s;ton, which was a vio|lation of private property, &amp; ought to be paid for. That tea was &s;ent on the &s;ame errand that Gageand his troops are; to effect by artifice what they are now attempting by force. I mention not Thomas Hutchin&s;on, for his crimes here, and condign puni&s;hment hereafter, without repent|ance, mu&s;t exceed all conception or de&s;cription. Should the Briti&s;h parliament cau&s;e cargoes of wine, impregnated with poi&s;on, to be &s;ent to America, with orders to have them di&s;per&s;ed among&s;t the inhabitants: and their &s;ervants, the mi&s;creants of their power, &s;hould ob&s;tinately in&s;i&s;t on doing it, the Americans mu&s;t de&s;troy the wines, which, by their baneful mixture would be ju&s;tly ob|noxious to de&s;truction, or be de&s;troyed by their poi&s;on.</P>
<P>MY countrymen, we have every thing to fear, from the malignity, power and cunning of our adver&s;aries. Yet, from the ju&s;tne&s;s of our cau&s;e, the greatne&s;s of our numbers and re&s;ources, the unanimity of our hearts, cemented by intere&s;t and by perils; the bravery, and what's more, the de&s;peratene&s;s of our &s;pirits; who think not life worth &s;aving, when all that is dear in life is gone, we have rea&s;on to be afraid of nothing. For your animation, hear the advice and lamentation of a French gentleman, Mon&s;ieur Mezeray, over the lo&s;t liberties of his country, to an Engli&s;h &s;ubject: <Q>We had once in France, the &s;ame happine&s;s and the &s;ame privileges, which you now have. Our laws were made by re|pre&s;entatives of our own choo&s;ing; therefore our mo|ney was not taken from us, but granted by us. Our Kings, were then &s;ubject to the rules of law and rea|&s;on. Now alas! we are mi&s;erable and all is lo&s;t Think nothing Sir, too dear to maintain the&s;e preci|cious advantages, if ever there &s;hould be occa&s;ion; venture your life and e&s;tate, rather than ba&s;ely &s;ub|mit to that abject condition to which you &s;ee us re|duced.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="014253_0060_0F93597309CD1438">
AND for your encouragement, turn your eyes to the free &s;tates of Holland and Switzerland; and in them, as in a gla&s;s, &s;ee America &s;trugglig under intolerable op|pre&s;&s;ions; and with an intrepid, unconquerable &s;pirit, overlooking all danger, bur&s;ting the bonds, and demo|li&s;hing the engines of tyranny, emerging from a &s;ea of calamities, ri&s;ing &s;uperior to every ob&s;tacle; and over|looking in time the power and towering heights of their haughty oppre&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>SINCE then we are compelled to take up the &s;word, in the nece&s;&s;ary defence or our country, our liberties and properties, our&s;elves and po&s;terity: Let us gird on the harne&s;s, having our bo&s;oms mailed, with firm defiance of every danger; and with fixed determined purpo&s;e, to part with our liberty only with our lives, engage in the conflict; and nobly play the man for our country, the cities and churches of him that tran&s;planted and hitherto &s;u&s;tained them; thereby prove the truth of our de&s;cent, and demon&s;trate to the world, that the free irrepre&s;&s;able &s;pirit, that in&s;pired the brea&s;ts and animated the conduct of our brave fore-fathers; is not degenerated in us, their offspring. With fair pretences, they invite us to &s;ub|mit our necks to their yoke; but with unheard of cru|elties and oppre&s;&s;ions, they determine us, to prefer death to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. Let none be di&s;heartened from a pro&s;|pect of the expence; though it &s;hould be to the half, or even the whole of our e&s;tates. Compared with the prize at &s;take, our liberty, the liberty of our country, of mankind, and of millions yet unborn, it would be ligh|ter than the du&s;t on the balance: For if we &s;ubmit, adieu for ever; adieu to property, for liberty will be lo&s;t, our only capacity of acquiring and holding property.</P>
<P>AND what &s;hall I &s;ay, of the officers and &s;oldiers of the Briti&s;h army, who are the appointed mini&s;ters of this vengeance on the Americans? again&s;t whom are they come forth, in ho&s;tile army? Strangers and foes to

them and their nation? No, it is again&s;t their brethren, their fellows and companions, of their fle&s;h and of their bone; members of the &s;ame nation; &s;ubjects of the &s;ame King; and entitled to the &s;ame or equal privileges; with kindred blood in their veins, and a pul&s;e beating high for Engli&s;h liberties. And can their hearts be courage|ous, and their hands &s;trong, when they level the &s;haft, or lift up the &s;pear again&s;t tho&s;e, with whom of late, &s;ide by &s;ide and &s;houlder to &s;houlder, in compacted battali|ons, they fought, bled, and conquered, in defence of the country, and the liberries, they are now &s;ent to lay wa&s;te and de&s;troy. I appeal to their &s;en&s;e of honour, their &s;entiments of ju&s;tice, to their bowels of humanity, tho&s;e tender feelings of &s;ympathy, the&s;e &s;ocial pa&s;&s;ions, that po&s;&s;e&s;s and warm the human heart, and are the &s;pring of all &s;ocial and public virtues, and let their tongues utter the &s;entiments of their &s;ouls, and Ameri|ca will be ju&s;tified, they being the judges.</P>
<P>METHINKS I hear the King, retired with his hand up|on his brea&s;t, in pen&s;ive &s;olliloquy, &s;aying to him&s;elf, who, and what am I? A King, that wears the crown, and &s;ways the &s;cepter of Great-Britain and America; and though a King, robed in royalty, yet I am a man, my power finite, my body mortal, and my&s;elf account|able to him, who rai&s;ed me to this dignity, that I might be his mini&s;ter for the people's good. But Oh! what tragic &s;cenes do I behold? One part of my dominions aiming de&s;truction again&s;t the other, plunging their &s;words in the bo&s;oms, and imbruing their hands in the blood of their fellows and brethren.

Well, what will be the mighty injury to my crown, or to the nation, in its wealth, &s;trength, or honour, if America &s;hould enjoy, its former freedom? What will be gained by reducing them to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and &s;lavery? lifele&s;s carca&s;es, a de&s;olated country, mil|lions in wealth, and millions in &s;trength da&s;hed at a blow.

Have not my &s;ubjects in Great-Britain rights that are &s;acred and inviolable, and which they would not re&s;ign but with their lives? They have. Have not my &s;ubjects in America rights equally &s;acred, and of which they are and ought to be equally tenacious? They have. And are not tho&s;e rights, for which they now &s;o earne&s;tly contend, of that kind? Certainly there is much in fa|vour of their claim. What if they are mi&s;taken? Ought they to atone for their mi&s;take by rivers of blood, and the &s;acrifice of them&s;elves, their country and their po&s;|terity? but what, my mind &s;hudders and recoils at the thought, what, if the Americans are right? Oh hea|ven forgive! And all this gha&s;tly ruin, is owing to the blunder of a mini&s;ter, and the fatal errors adopted by parliament. Of whom will the&s;e rivers of blood be re|quired? What can expiate &s;uch accumulated wrongs? and atone for &s;uch amazing deva&s;tations? I am &s;orely di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, civil war rages within, foreign enemies threa|ten without, the commerce of my kingdom langui&s;heth, manufacturers fami&s;h and fail, and di&s;contentment is almo&s;t univer&s;al. What &s;hall I do for the dignity of my crown, the peace of my dominions, and the &s;afety of the nation? All is at ri&s;k. I have been deceived by my informers, mi&s;guided by my mini&s;ters, and by my
<PB N="64" REF="014253_0063_0F93597526B64F10">
own inattention to the &s;ufferings, and dutiful petitions of my &s;ubjects, reduced all to the mo&s;t dreadful hazard. For Briti&s;h troops cea&s;e to be glorious, in &s;o inglorious a cau&s;e. Should their &s;ea-ports, from Georgia to Nova-Scotia, be de&s;olated with fire and &s;word, it would only con&s;olidate their union, and render more impregnable their re&s;i&s;tance in the interior country. Could we dry up their harbours, and bar every out-let to the &s;ea, un|le&s;s we had power to re&s;train the &s;howers and the &s;hines of heaven; and the fertility of the earth, they will po&s;|&s;e&s;s inexhau&s;table re&s;ources. America mu&s;t and will be free, their ance&s;tors acquired it for them, my royal predece&s;&s;ors guaranteed it to them; it is theirs by pur|cha&s;e, it is theirs by the plighted faith of Kings; they are de&s;erving of it; and with them it flouri&s;heth, like a plant of generous kind, in its native &s;oil, and the hea|vens are propitious to liberty. My legions mu&s;t be re|called, the &s;word mu&s;t be &s;heathed, the olive branch, the &s;ymbol of peace be held out; for it was never de|&s;igned that Britons, invin&s;ible by others, &s;hould con|tend with Britons or their de&s;cendants, in battle; and royal munificence be exerted, to alleviate the di&s;tre&s;&s;es, con&s;ole the mi&s;eries, and repair the injuries, cau&s;ed by the unhappy error, which let eternal darkne&s;s veil. Oh! may the future make reparation for the pa&s;t, my crown flouri&s;h in the pro&s;perity, liberty, and the happi|ne&s;s of all my dominions. Thus will my reign become glorious, my demi&s;e tranquil. But alas! where am I tran&s;ported on the wings of groundle&s;s fancy? Repen|tance I fear is too late, for crimes &s;o enormous; the in|juries are irreparable, and America is irretrievably lo&s;t: the thunders I prepared, to lay her breathle&s;s at my feet, have di&s;charged her of her allegiance, and driven her forever from my power.</P>

<P>To con&s;ider things rightly, is to con&s;ider them truly as they are, with all their relations and attending cir|cum&s;tances, to inve&s;tigate truth, is the highe&s;t atchieve|ment of rea&s;on; and to follow nature, the perfection of art. That which is conformable to axioms of im|mutable truth, founded in rea&s;on, and productive of general &s;ecurity and happine&s;s to mankind, mu&s;t in e|very &s;en&s;e, be denominated good.</P>
<P>CIVIL &s;ociety, is allowed by all to be the greate&s;t tem|peral ble&s;&s;ing; and civil government is ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary to its &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; it is a temporary remedy, again&s;t the ill effects of general depravity; and becau&s;e the in|troduction of moral evil has made it nece&s;&s;ary; it is not therefore a nece&s;&s;ary evil.</P>
<P>LIBERTY con&s;i&s;ts in a power of acting under the gui|dance and controul of rea&s;on: Licentiou&s;ne&s;s in acting under the influence of &s;en&s;ual pa&s;&s;ions, contrary to the dictates of rea&s;on; whil&s;t we contend for the former, we ought to bear te&s;timony again&s;t the latter: And whil&s;t we point out arguments again&s;t the errors and abu&s;es of government, we ought cautiou&s;ly to di&s;tingui&s;h between government and its abu&s;es; to amputate the latter, without injuring the former, and not indifferently charge both; le&s;t we rai&s;e an army of rebel &s;pirits more danger|ous and difficult to reduce, than all the legions of Britain.</P>
<P>GOVERNMENT originates (under God) from the people, as from its native &s;ource; centers in them, their good is its ultimate object; and operates by &s;ecuring to them, the enjoyment of their natural rights and civil privileges; and as the mode of doing this, hath no pre&s;cribed form in nature, or revelation; mankind, at their option, have endeavoured it variou&s;ly; and thereby given ri&s;e to the
<PB N="66" REF="014253_0065_0F935976CA669130">
various forms of government &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in the world, as monarchy, ari&s;tocracy, democracy, &amp;c. each of the&s;e have failed in their turns, through want of integrity, or di&s;cernment, or both in the admini&s;tration; and have been alternately preferred or di&s;carded by writers, not &s;o much on account of their own excellence or defects, as of tho&s;e who admini&s;tered them. That form of go|vernment that is adapted to the genius and circum|&s;tances of the governed, affords them the greate&s;t &s;ecuri|ty, and places the authority of the governing mo&s;t out of the reach of the former, to violate and contemn, their corruptions and abu&s;es mo&s;t within, to prevent and re|dre&s;s, is the be&s;t. A perfect model of civil government perfectly admini&s;tered and obeyed, cannot be expected, but in a &s;tate of perfection, where it would be perfectly unnece&s;&s;ary. That government in ordinary is the be&s;t that is be&s;t admini&s;tered.</P>
<P>SOME begin their government with their political ex|i&s;tence; it grows up with them; the great fir&s;t princi|ples thereof, are never altered while they continue a peo|ple, &amp; become &s;o incorporated with their being, that they have the force of natural, rather than political in&s;tituti|ons. Others, after a century or two have occa&s;ion to alter and new model their old governments, or frame new ones: This is u&s;ually attended with much difficul|ty and great danger, requires an exten&s;ive knowledge of the genius, tempers, circum&s;tances, &s;ituation, ancient cu&s;toms, habits, laws and manners of the people; and great judgment and &s;kill, to adapt new regulations to old u&s;uages, &s;o as to form a happy coalition. The Briti&s;h nation, at the time of forming their great charter (no matter how they became &s;o) con&s;i&s;ted of a King, nobi|lity and commons: To connect the &s;trength and wi&s;dom of the&s;e, for the public weal, without infringing or en|dangering the rights of either, was their great object: And this was done in the con&s;titution of parliament, &s;o far as it concerned legi&s;lation and taxation. Its object
<PB N="67" REF="014253_0066_0F93597786144A28">
therefore, was directly, political and civil liberty. All offices were in the gift of the crown; and the payment of them in the option of the people; The powers of go|vernment were &s;o balanced, as to render all mutual re|&s;traints upon, and mutually re&s;trained by each other. If the people have lo&s;t their liberties, &s;uffered them&s;elves to be bought and &s;old, like bea&s;ts of burden, the fault is theirs and their corrupters, and not the con&s;titution's, which put in their power to have pre&s;erved them.</P>
<P>THUS, the principles were excellent, altho' the prac|tice hath been mo&s;t perver&s;e. Among&s;t all the forms of civil government, none can be pronounced ab&s;olutely be&s;t, and only relatively &s;o: For that which be&s;t &s;uits one people would badly &s;uit another, or the &s;ame, at a different period.</P>
<P>THE &s;trength and &s;pring of every free government, is the virtue of the people; virtue grows on knowledge, and knowledge on education. Mo&s;t nations have e&s;tab|li&s;hed a fal&s;hood for their fir&s;t principle, viz. that their Kings are perfect; and the con&s;equence of this, is a &s;e|cond, that gives them a licence to &s;erve the devil with impunity, viz. that they can do no wrong: Then follows the mo&s;t impious a&s;criptions of divine qualities and ti|tles to him; and to compleat the image, the riches of the nation are lavi&s;hed in the magnificence, co&s;tly equi|page and dazzling &s;plendors of their prince; thereby to build power on &s;how; and like the <HI>formido avium,</HI> or &s;care crow, derive re&s;pect and obedience only from the pa&s;&s;ion of fear: A multitude of criminal laws, with &s;e|vere penalties are nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport the authority of the rulers, and &s;ecure the obedience of the &s;ubjects; whil&s;t the &s;overeign him&s;elf, is wholly in&s;ecure in the mid&s;t of his &s;ubjects, without a life guard. This is inverting the order of nature and of civil government; and leav|ing the nece&s;&s;ary means of rendering mankind wi&s;e, vir|tuous and good. Rulers ought to know, and be known to their &s;ubjects, to be but men; and the puni&s;hment of
<PB N="68" REF="014253_0067_0F93597825461570">
their crimes, to be in proportion to their elevation in power. Half the &s;um, employed to diffu&s;e general knowledge; by erecting public &s;eminaries, with ma&s;|ters well furni&s;hed to teach children, not only common learning, but to in&s;truct and impre&s;s on their young and tender minds, the principles of virtue and the rudiments of government, which would grow up with their growth, and derive &s;trength from age; would be more effectual than all the brilliancy of a crown, or tortures of a rack; this is the only permanent foundation of a free govern|ment; this is laying the foundation in a con&s;titution, not without or over, but within the &s;ubjects; love and not fear will become the &s;pring of their obedience: the ruler be di&s;tingui&s;hed, only by his di&s;tingui&s;hed virtues, and know no good, &s;eparate from that of his &s;ubjects; and his authority be &s;upported, more by the virtue of the people, than by the terror of his power. The only way to make men good &s;ubjects of a rational and free govern|ment, is to make them wi&s;e and virtuous; but &s;uch a government as this is utterly incompatible with the idea of &s;lavery, becau&s;e incompatible with a &s;tate of ignorance.</P>

<HEAD>OF INDEPENDANCE.</HEAD>
<P>IT is with &s;tates as it is with men, they have their in|fancy, their manhood and their decline: Nature hath its cour&s;e in all, and never works in vain; when a peo|ple are ripe for any mighty change, means wont be wanting to effect it. From what providence hath done and is doing for us, we mu&s;t learn, what is our duty to do; for we may only follow, where nature leads, and in this is infinite &s;afety; from &s;mall, we are become great, from a few, many, from feeble, powerful, from poor, rich; nature has &s;tored our country with all nece&s;&s;aries for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence in peace, and for defence in war; it has united our hearts, our intere&s;ts and our councils, in the common cau&s;e.</P>
<P>INDEPENDANCE con&s;i&s;ts in being under obligation to acknowledge no &s;uperior power on earth. The King by

withdrawing his protection and levying war upon us, has di&s;charged us of our allegiance, and of all obligati|ons to obedience: For protection and &s;ubjection are mutual, and cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t a part: He having violated the compact on his part, we of cour&s;e are relea&s;ed from ours; and on the &s;ame principles, if we owed any obedience to parliament (which we did not) we are wholly di&s;|charged of it. We are compelled to provide, not only for our own &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, but for defence again&s;t a pow|erful enemy: Our affections are weaned from Great-Britain, by &s;imilar means and almo&s;t as miraculou&s;ly as the I&s;raelites were from Egypt: The&s;e are facts, a &s;ur|pri&s;ing concurrence of incidents, equally out of our knowledge to have fore&s;een, or our power to have pre|vented, point us to &s;ome great event. Providence has furni&s;hed us with the means; the King, contrary to his de&s;ign, hath di&s;charged us of our allegiance and forced us from our dependance, and we are become nece&s;&s;arily independant, in order to pre&s;ervation and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and this without our act or choice. And is it a crime to be, what we cant help but be? It is not from a rebellious &s;pirit in the Americans, but unavoidable nece&s;&s;ity, that we are become &s;o: Like a timorous child that is able to walk but di&s;inclined to attempt it, placed in the middle of a floor, mu&s;t u&s;e his legs or fall; while the tender parent that placed him there, &s;tands ready to &s;ave him, if likely to fall, <HI>nam qui tran&s;tulit &s;u&s;tinet,</HI> He that tran&s;|planted, upholds and &s;u&s;tains. All Europe, mu&s;t gaze with wonder, approbation and applau&s;e; Great-Britain join in acquitting us; while the tyrant mini&s;ter (Lord North) in his own bo&s;om reads the &s;entence of his con|demnation, for condemning us: to be where nature and providence hath placed us, is to be right, and to do what &s;uch a &s;tate points out and requires to be done, is duty. In this &s;ituation two objects of the greate&s;t im|portance demand our attention, viz. defence and govern|ment; the&s;e we ought diligently to attend to and leave

And &s;ince parliament will have our trade, only on terms incompatible with our liberty, permit them to have neither; welcome all nations to our ports and to a participation of our trade, and enter into alliance with none; thus, we may enjoy the commerce of all, without being concerned in the quarrels of any. Providence has furni&s;hed us with re&s;ources for defence; numbers to con&s;titute armies, materials for con&s;tructing a navy, for making of powder, ball, cannon, mortars, arms, &amp;c. and all kinds of ordnance and military &s;tores. Our threatened &s;ituation demands, that we immediately take every pre|caution, and u&s;e all the means in our power for our pre|&s;ervation &amp; defence, and with noble and valiant exertions, with&s;tand and repel the attacks of tyranny. Nature hath placed the i&s;land of Great-Britain, and the continent of America &s;o di&s;tant from each other, that it is impo&s;&s;ible for them to be repre&s;ented in one legi&s;lative body: The con&s;equence is, that their di&s;tant &s;ituations are incompa|tible with their being &s;ubjects to one &s;upreme legi&s;la|ture. Repre&s;entation is the feet on which a free govern|ment &s;tands, it ought therefore to be equal and full; maim and render partial the former, and it will infalli|bly mutilate the latter. The mea&s;ures of government nece&s;&s;ary to be adopted, at pre&s;ent, are the &s;ame, either for a temporary or a perpetual expedient.</P>
<P>THE colonies have &s;o long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted &s;eparate and in|dependant of each other, enjoyed their particular forms of government, laws, cu&s;toms and manners and particu|lar rules for the regulation and di&s;tribution of property; that it will, doubtle&s;s, be thought expedient for each to retain its antient form of government, laws, &amp;c. as far as po&s;&s;ible; to have &s;upreme legi&s;lative and executive powers of government over all cau&s;es, matters and things within its territorial limits, and to regulate its own inter|nal

police. Tho&s;e who&s;e Governors, or other officers, are taken off by the crown, to have them elected by the freemen, or appointed by their &s;everal a&s;&s;emblies; for which purpo&s;e particular con&s;titutions to be framed, as they &s;hall elect. That a certain number of delegates be annually elected by the freemen in each colony, to form a general council or congre&s;s, who&s;e power to extend o|ver all matters of common and general concernment: Such as making war and peace, &s;ending and receiving amba&s;&s;adors, general regulations re&s;pecting trade and maritime affairs; to decide all matters of controver&s;y between colony and colony, relative to bounds and li|mits, &amp;c. &amp;c. of whom one to be cho&s;en pre&s;ident, and to continue in office until another be cho&s;en and &s;worn. And in matters &s;o intere&s;ting, as that of making war and peace, to be a majority of at lea&s;t two thirds, computed by colonies; and for carrying on a war to have power to levy troops and provide for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, &amp;c. to have an explicit con&s;titution, a&s;certaining the number of mem|bers the congre&s;s &s;hall con&s;i&s;t of, and that each colony &s;hall &s;end; containing regulations for convening, pro|roguing and adjourning; al&s;o granting, defining, and limiting the powers they are to have, exerci&s;e, &amp;c. which con&s;titution to be laid before the &s;everal a&s;&s;emblies; and by them acceded to and confirmed. By &s;ome &s;uch me|thod the colonies may retain their independance of each other; and all their former u&s;uages, laws, &amp;c. and the wi&s;dom and &s;trength of each, be connected in general congre&s;s, for the &s;ecurity and defence of the whole.</P>
<P>TO be reconciled to Great-Britain upon unju&s;t terms, is to be reconciled to inju&s;tice, ruin and &s;lavery; until they &s;hall have condemned the mea&s;ures that have been pur&s;ued again&s;t America, recalled their fleets and ar|mies, expo&s;ed to the public eye, and condign puni&s;h|ment, the authors and advi&s;ers of the pre&s;ent unju&s;t and cruel war; and have repaired the damage and ex|pence cau&s;ed thereby in America, and given up the

cannot expect that we will treat with them, about fu|ture connections. They have endeavoured, by all the arts of &s;eduction, and of power, to de&s;troy and en&s;lave us; and now they have &s;ent commi&s;&s;ioners, under pre|tence of treating with the Americans. Accommodation is their often&s;ible, but we have rea&s;on to fear that to divide; corrupt and de&s;troy is their real object: For with whom are they to treat? With the general Congre&s;s? No; it is &s;aid, with the &s;everal governors; all of whom, ex|cept one or two, live, and breath, and have their being, in the mini&s;ter, and are mov'd by him like the puppets in the &s;how, by the hand that pulls the wire, to which they are hung. They might as well have &s;tayed at home, and treated with the mini&s;ter. But it is &s;aid they are to treat with the &s;everal colonies. But how is this? unle&s;s they acknowledge their independence of parlia|ment? The &s;upreme legi&s;lature of a country only, hath power to treat and be treated with re&s;pecting war and peace. The act, 6th Geo. III. declares that the parlia|ment of Great-Britain hath &s;upreme power of legi&s;lati|tion over the colonies; and to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch power, the parliament is in war with America: The Commi&s;|&s;iners therefore, cannot, con&s;i&s;tent with their ideas of power, treat with any but the Briti&s;h parliament. By &s;ending Commi&s;&s;ioners to treat with us, they would acknowledge our power to make a treaty; which is pre|dicable only of independence. Query then, whether tho&s;e Commi&s;&s;ioners are coming to treat for peace, with a mighty armament for war? In fine, that government, in which the people are &s;ubject to no laws, or taxes, but by their voice or con&s;ent; condemned by no &s;entence but by the verdict of their equals; where property is near equally di&s;tributed; crimes clearly defined and di&s;tingui&s;hed, &amp; puni&s;hments duly proportioned to their nature and magnitude; and where the ri&s;ing generation are univer&s;ally in&s;tructed in the principles of virtue, and the rudiments of government; there civil liberty &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"></P>
